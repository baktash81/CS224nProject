  i admire your courage  miss    
trench    sylvia trench

  it s an idea  at that 
eight 
  excuse me  sir 
  thank you 
andré  i must pass the shoe 
i hope you ll forgive me 
but it s most important 
have those changed  will you 
too bad you have to go 
just as things were getting interesting 
yes 
tell me  miss trench 
do you play any other games 
i mean  besides chemin de fer  
golf  amongst other things 
  tomorrow afternoon  then 
  tomorrow

afterwards  perhaps 
sounds tempting 
may i let you know in the morning 
splendid 
my number s on the card 
see if he s there  will you 
james  where on earth have you been 
i ve been searching london for you 
007 is here  sir 
he ll see you in a minute 
moneypenny 
  what gives 
  me  given an ounce of encouragement 
you never take me
to dinner looking like this 
  you never take me to dinner  period 
  i would  you know 
only m would have me court martialled
for illegal use of government property 
flattery will get you nowhere 
but don t stop trying  now   
  what s all this to do about 
  strangways  it looks serious 
we ve been burning the air between here
and jamaica for the last three hours 
  in you go 
  don t forget to write 
good evening  sir 
it happens to be 3am 
when do you sleep  007 
never on the firm s time  sir 
sit down 
jamaica went off the air 
in the middle of the opening procedure 
we ve checked up
and strangways has disappeared 
so has his secretary 
we d only just sent her out there 
was strangways on something special 
an inquiry from the americans 
there is massive interference
with their cape canaveral rockets 
they think it comes
from the jamaica area 
  does  toppling  mean anything to you 
  a little 
throwing the controls of a guided missile
off balance with a radio beam 
five million dollars  worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the south atlantic
and finishing up in the brazilian jungle
is bad enough 
but now they re gonna try orbiting
a rocket round the moon 
the american cia sent a man down
to work with strangways 
a fellow by the name of leiter 
i ve heard of him  but never met him 
has he found out anything important 
you d better ask him 
you re on the 7 o clock plane to kingston 
that gives you exactly
three hours 22 minutes 
armourer 
you ll get the background papers
at the airport  in a self destructor bag 
you can study them during the flight 
i want to know
what s happened to strangways 
sir 
take off your jacket 
give me your gun 
this damn beretta again 
i ve told you about this before 
you tell him  for the last time 
nice and light  in a lady s handbag 
  no stopping power 
  any comments  007 
i disagree  i ve used a beretta for
ten years and never missed with it yet 
but it jammed on your last job
and you spent six months in hospital 
a double o number means you re
licensed to kill  not get killed 
since i ve been head of ml7  there s
been a 40 drop in double o casualties 
i want it to stay that way 
you ll carry the walther 
unless you d prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties 
no  sir  i would not 
then from now on
you carry a different gun  show him 
walther ppk  7 65 mil with a delivery
like a brick through a plate glass window 
takes a brausch silencer
with little reduction in muzzle velocity 
  the cia swear by them 
  thank you  major boothroyd 
thank you  sir 
  any questions  007 
  no  sir 
  all right  best of luck 
  thank you  sir 
  007 
  sir

miss moneypenny  forget
the usual repartee  007 s in a hurry 
ciao

i decided to accept your invitation 
that was for tomorrow afternoon 
do you always dress this way for golf 
i changed into something more
comfortable  i hope i did the right thing 
you did the right thing 
but you picked the wrong moment 
  i have to leave immediately 
  that s too bad

immediately

now  mr jones  talk fast 
before your friend doubles back 
who are you working for 
i don t know what you re talking about 
i was just sent to meet you at the airport 
  but by whom

  i don t think so 
both hands on the wheel 
i m a very nervous passenger 
get out  move 
keep your hands where i can see them 
get up 
  now talk 
  all right 
let me have a cigarette 
to hell with you 
sergeant  make sure he doesn t get away 
cyanide in a cigarette  fantastic 
  no less 
  duff  what have you got for us 
the car was stolen and we haven t
been able to identify the driver yet 
but he surely wasn t a kingston man 
  well  news of my arrival leaked 
  we didn t advertise it  i can assure you 
perhaps not  i got the impression
someone had been selling tickets 
anything more we can do for you 
i want to meet the last people
to see strangways 
nobody seems to have seen him
after he left our bridge four 
  who were the others 
  professor dent   
metallurgist  runs a test laboratory 
respected  clean bill 
  potter   
  old general  been here for ages 
  we ll start with those 
  want them brought in 
  lord  no  i want to meet them socially 
  i can introduce you at the club 
  i d like to see strangways  place 
  i ll run you up there now 
go on in 
that s her blood patch 
  they ve grouped it as o rh positive 
  that s her group  all right 
the set was still switched on
when we came round 
we tried to get through 
but it was dead the other end 
and it ll stay dead  all frequencies are
changed immediately security s broken 
receipt from dent laboratories 
  geology a hobby of strangways 
  not that i know of  no 
who s the man with strangways 
  one of the local fishermen 
  he drove the car that tailed me 
is that so  that gives us something
to work on  i ll have him checked 
you do that  i want to change
before i meet pleydell smith at the club 
one medium dry vodka martini 
mixed like you said  and not stirred 
  anything else  sir 
  no  that s all 
curious  old strangways
just vanishing like that 
or is it  cherchez la femme 
his secretary was very nice indeed 
  did you know her 
  i ve seen her around 
none of you can throw any light
on what happened to him 
his conversation  any hint 
i never heard him talk about anything
but big game fishing and bridge 
he got the fishing bug three weeks ago 
he s been out practically every day since 
it must have cost him something 
these fishermen ask the earth to charter 
and quarrel s the most expensive of all 
  quarrel 
  a cayman islander 
  he keeps a boat in the harbour 
  i see 
thank you 
excuse me 
where do i find quarrel 
he him 
your name quarrel 
maybe 
i m a friend of commander strangways 
ain t that nice 
i like people who s friends of people 
i thought you might be able
to tell me what happened to him 
as far as i know  nothing happened 
unless you know different 
where did you take him in your boat 
you see that  captain 
that there s the caribbean 
that s where  fishing 
i m interested in fishing 
i d like to charter your boat 
it s not for hire 
seems i came to the wrong address 
that s all right 
if you ll excuse me 
i got business to attend to 
pussfeller 
well  if it ain t my friend
what gets addresses mixed 
you got the right one this time
if you likes good eating 
i do  if the conversation matches it 
back at the boat too public 
in there it different 
after you 
sure thing 
  hey  man  you see we get some privacy 
  nothing but  quarrel 
  take a seat 
  i m fine 
ok  mister 
supposin  you start the conversation 
how s about it 
ain t no use you struggling 
pussfeller wrestles alligators 
right  up slowly and face that wall 
hold it 
gently  bud  gently 
let s not get excited 
frisk him 
nothing 
interesting 
where were you measured for this 
my tailor  savile row 
is that so  mine s a guy in washington 
felix leiter 
central intelligence agency 
  you must be james bond 
  you mean we re fighting the same war 
when i saw you leave the airport with
the opposition  i figured i must be wrong 
this is quarrel 
  no hard feelings  i hope 
  only a sore hand  glad to know you 
  pussfeller owns the place 
  i hope he cooks better than he fights 
nobody died from my cooking   yet 
there you are 
cape canaveral is screaming 
they don t want anything to go wrong
with this moon rocket launch 
yet strangways didn t think
the interference came from here 
  i suppose you cased the joint 
  i checked unofficially 
you limeys can be touchy
about trespassing 
strangways and quarrel
checked the islands 
you found nothing 
where did you look 
just about everywhere 
fire island  crab key  morgan s reef 
  checked them all thoroughly 
  all except crab key  we had no right 
  why not 
  it belongs to a chinese   
get her  quarrel  and the camera 
evening  missis 
you re hurting 
the captain wants you
to have a drink with us 
  you re hurting me 
  you can t mean it 
good evening 
  why do you want another picture of me 
  i only got your hat at the airport 
  tell this ape to let me go 
  why do you want a picture at all 
because that s the way i earn my living 
who pays you 
the daily gleaner 
pussfeller  pussfeller 
  anything i can do 
  ever seen this girl before 
she come here sometimes 
you want for me to get rid of her 
no  just ring the gleaner  find out
if they sent a photographer here tonight 
they didn t send me  i work freelance 
freelance  for whom 
you   
tell us and he ll stop 
we don t get nothing out of this gal 
you want me to break her arm 
another time 
the second time nothing s come out 
give her her arm back 
run along  freelance 
you ll be sorry 
you ll all be sorry  you rats 
one takes cyanide  another would have
had her arm broken  neither would talk 
  who puts that sort of scare into people 
  i think maybe we d better find out fast 
you were talking about crab key 
why can t we go there 
it belongs to a chinese character 
he won t allow anyone to land 
i had our naval reconnaissance planes
take a look 
they found nothing but a bauxite mine 
low scan ch radar setup 
  there s nothing illegal about that 
  crab key scares me plenty 
friends of mine went out
there once after seashells 
only trouble  they never came back again 
the local fishermen won t go near it 
strangways and me  we slip in at night 
he take some samples  we came straight
back  don t do to hang about there 
  what kind of samples 
  bits of rock  sand  water 
i see 
crab key begins to interest me 
what else do we know
about this chinese gentleman 
nothing much  except his name 
dr no 
  i d like to see professor dent 
  have you an appointment 
james bond 
we met yesterday at the club 
very well 
he s somewhere in the lab 
is professor dent there 
oh  never mind

yes  i came across this
in strangways  office 
your receipt 
  yes  that s right 
  can you tell me anything about it 
poor old strangways 
bit of a bug of his  this amateur geology 
he brought some samples in for testing 
convinced they were valuable 
were they 
of course not 
just low grade iron pyrites 
  can i see them 
  i threw  em away 
  do you know where he found them 
  no  he didn t say 
  crab key  perhaps 
  definitely not 
  why so certain 
  not geologically possible 
thank you  professor  it s very kind of you
to spare me your time 
you re very welcome  mr bond 
professor   
allow me 
morning 
  i have to get to crab key 
  you know the procedure

i ll take responsibility 
  man  i hope you know what you re doing

why have you disobeyed
my strictest rule and come in daylight 
i had to 
bond came to see me this morning 
yes  i know  i gave orders that he should
be killed  why is he still alive 
  our attempts failed 
  your attempts failed 
i do not like failure  you are not
going to fail me again  professor 
no  i came to warn you 
  warn me 
  tell you 
bond has discovered
those rock samples came from crab key 
he s not a fool 
he s sure to come out here 
i hope not  if he does 
i shall hold you responsible

yes  quite clear 
go to the table

  thank you  good night 
  good night  mr bond 
  morning  pleydell smith 
  bond 
sorry to trouble you so early  i need
all you have on dr no and crab key 
miss taro  bring me the files on dr no 
  what do you know about this island 
  not much  except there s a bauxite mine 
dr no runs it like a concentration camp 
i ve heard rumours 
but no one s complained officially 
  miss taro  just leave them here 
  we can t find them anywhere 
  what do you mean  who had them last 
  commander strangways  both files 
all right  miss taro 
damn nuisance 
their disappearing like that 
on the contrary 
i d have been surprised if they hadn t 
by the way  that came for you
from london  in the diplomatic pouch 
a present from home 
can i get out that way 
that s a naughty habit  
listening at keyholes 
i wasn t listening 
i was looking for those files 
anything that can t be found 
i get the blame 
forget it 
it s not very important anyhow 
i d hate to think you were spending
all afternoon looking for them 
no  i have the afternoon off 
there s a coincidence  so have i 
why don t you show me round the island 
what should i say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman 
you should say yes 
i should say maybe 
three o clock at my hotel    maybe 
  yes  maybe 
  good 
the luminous dial activates it 
hold this 
where exactly did
strangways place those samples 
  about where your feet is  sir 
  good 
  hi  there 
  hi 
  lose something 
  take a look at this geiger reading 
those samples strangways brought back
from crab key were radioactive 
yet professor dent told me they were
worthless chunks of iron ore 
  he s either a bad professor or a poor liar 
  i intend to find out which 
quarrel  how soon can you
get us over to crab key 
well  it s like this here  captain 
strangways  he done take samples
of all the islands 
  we could check the nearest ones first 
  no  it s crab key i m interested in 
i done take the commander there 
we got away without trouble 
it don t do for a man
to tempt providence too often 
  you see  there s a dragon 
  what 
native superstition 
started by dr no  probably 
all right  quarrel  we won t force you 
leiter and i will go after dark 
if you ll give us directions 
i gets my navigational directions
from my nose  my ears   my instincts 
anyway  i ll be here about seven 
fine 
mr bond  there s
a telephone message for you 
johnny  what have you done with it 
hello 
mr bond 
i was thinking  why don t you
collect me at my apartment 
it s lovely up here in the mountains 
nice and cool 
all right 
you leave the port royal road
out of kingston 
then along the windward road 
until you get to the cement factory 
then you turn left 
follow the road up the hill 
down the other side 
then two miles further on  on the left 
magenta drive 239 
i ll be waiting for you 
how did it happen 
i think they were
on their way to a funeral 
just a minute 
  you did invite me  remember 
  of course 
i just didn t expect you here so soon 
yes  come in 
i ll just go and put some clothes on 
don t go to any trouble on my account 
please 
forgive me  i thought i was
invited up here to admire the view 
i feel one of us should answer it 
hello 
yes  i know  he s here now 
i don t know what happened 
right  i ll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours 
i ll have to go now 
i ll call you later 
you believe in living dangerously 
i can see that 
what do you mean 
sitting around with wet hair 
you ll die of pneumonia 
  it s rather beautiful 
  thank you 
  do you always wear it up 
  don t you like it that way 
yes  very much 
with your sort of face  it s wonderful 
  what s going on behind my back 
  nothing 
look  no hands 
i m hungry  let s go out and eat 
  i ll make you a chinese dinner here 
  i m feeling italian and musical 
  let s go to the blue mountain grill 
  i d rather stay here 
it s more fun    alone 
yes  but i don t want you
getting dishpan hands 
  i like cooking 
  forget it  may i use your phone 
who are you ringing 
taxi 
james bond here  can i have
a car sent to 2171 magenta drive 
as soon as you can  please 
thank you 
  i thought you came by car 
  damn thing wouldn t start 
that explains

why you need a taxi 
why i need a taxi 
careful   my nail varnish 
  the lights 
  no  i always leave them on 
  what s going on 
  book her  superintendent  will you 
and   
be careful of her nail varnish 
drop it  professor  and behind you 
it s funny  i thought you d turn up
sooner or later  sit down 
the girl talked 
but of course 
i was suspicious
at the queens club anyhow 
you were the only one
who d seen strangways  new secretary 
and then later at the lab 
you made no reference to the fact that
strangways  samples were radioactive 
very clever  mr bond 
you re up against more than you know  if
you shoot me  you ll end like strangways 
  and you killed him 
  he was killed  but never mind how 
who are you working for  professor 
you might as well know  as you won t live 
i m working for   
it s a smith   wesson 
and you ve had your six 
  better late than never 
  everything ready 
yeah  for the last two hours 
don t worry  quarrel  it ll be fine 
bottom part of where my belly
used to be tells me different 
for me  crab key will be
a gentle relaxation 
  from what  dames 
  no  from being a clay pigeon 
this is as far as we go with the engine 
make with paddle and wind from now on 
ok 
  let me go with you 
  no  we settled that  it s my beat 
but it s my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck 
canaveral can only wait
48 hours for that moonshot 
if we re not back in 12  then it s your beat 
you d better bring your marines with you 
quarrel  if you see a dragon  get in first
and breathe on him  you hear 
with all that rum in you  he ll die happy 
better drop the sail
in case their radar s on scan 
hard about  captain  now 
cover it up 
we d better get some sleep before
it gets light  i ll be down this end 
who is that 
it s all right  i m not supposed
to be here  either  i take it you re not 
  are you alone 
  what are you doing  looking for shells 
  no  i m just looking 
  stay where you are 
  i promise i won t steal your shells

  what s your name 
  james 
honey  did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here 
of course  i always do 
then they ll know we re here 
they have radar 
my boat is too small to be noticed 
and i often come here to get the shells 
at first they tried to catch me 
but they couldn t 
  now they don t bother any more 
  they will this time 
  don t bother with those now 
  don t bother 
are they valuable 
this one is worth  50 in miami  50 
you promise you won t tell anyone 
i promise 
  hey  come and take a look 
  it s all right  he s with me 
captain  what do you think of that 
what s the matter 
that s a high powered boat 
take some cover  come on 
they re here all right 
ok  folks 
come out and you won t get hurt 
stand up and show yourselves
or i ll be forced to open fire 
come on out 
we know you re there 
we ve been expecting you  walk out
with your hands up and you ll be ok 
  this is your last chance 
  he s bluffing  keep your head down 
all right  you ve been warned  this is it 
lie still  it won t last long 
they don t really know we re here 
fire 
are you coming out 
all right  then 
we ll be back 
we ll be back with the dogs 
full speed ahead 
i warned you about this place 
that was a machine gun  not a dragon 
  there s a dragon here  too 
  she s right 
  you ve seen it 
  yes  i have 
he had two glaring eyes  a short tail 
pointed wings  and was breathing fire 
you don t believe me  do you 
little gal  i does  i tell you  mr bond 
let s get the hell outta here 
listen  both of you 
there are no such things as dragons 
you saw something that looked like one 
i m trying to think what it was 
how do you know there aren t 
did you ever see a mongoose dance 
or a scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death 
or a praying mantis
eat her husband after making love 
  i hate to admit it  but i haven t 
  well  i have 
she s right 
all right  they ve gone 
honey  you re getting out of here 
i m getting out when i m ready 
and that s never in daylight 
this time you are  and fast 
where s your boat 
fetch my shoes 
look  look what they ve done 
it s all your fault 
i m sorry  i ll get you a new boat
when we get back to kingston 
what are we going to do with her now 
if you like  i know
a good place where we can hide 
that ll do for a start 
leave the things you don t need  quick 
  must we come this way 
  yes  it throws the dogs off the scent 
  damn mosquitoes 
  rub water all over yourself 
it s the salt they re after 
quick  they s coming  across there 
quarrel  cut some of those reeds 
give me the knife 
over there 
they re coming closer 
  keep quiet 
  something s biting me 
if you disturb the mud 
they ll know we re here  get down 
looks like they re onto something 
get down 
  why 
  because i had to 
he sure knew his business 
trailing us after we let the others pass 
we must get out of here 
where is this hiding place 
up there 
come on 
you smell nicer already 
thank you 
mr bond  quick 
  what is it now 
  look at these 
those are dragon tracks 
that s where he breathed 
you ought to get some rest if you want to 
i stay out here on watch 
  in case he comes a iooking for us 
  right  i ll take the second watch 
we ll be out of here by midnight 
i never met a detective before 
  are you going to arrest dr no 
  someone is 
we can t have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here 
he doesn t just try 
  i m pretty sure he killed my father 
  what do you mean by that 
you see  my father
was a marine zoologist 
we came to the caribbean
for him to study seashells 
then one day he came to crab key 
and i never saw him again 
they said he must have been drowned 
but he was far too good a diver for that 
didn t the police investigate 
or your family 
they investigated for a long time 
then they said
 missing  presumed dead  
i haven t got any family 
there was only my father and me 
you mean you re here all alone 
where did you live before 
all over the world 
the philippines  bali  hawaii 
anywhere there were shells 
  you went to school somewhere 
  no need  we had an encyclopedia 
i started at a when i was eight 
and now i ve reached t 
i bet i know a lot more things than you do 
didn t anyone in kingston help 
well  there was this man who owned
the place where we were living 
he let me stay on
for a while without paying 
then one night he came up
to my room    well  you know 
i scratched his face  and then   
but he was stronger than i was 
what happened after that 
i put a black widow spider
underneath his mosquito net 
a female  and they re the worst 
it took him a whole week to die 
did i do wrong 
well  it wouldn t do to make a habit of it 
do you have a woman of your own 
captain  quick  down here 
whatever s coming 
it s coming this way 
this time i want to see it 
and hurry  
there s less than 12 hours to go 
stay where you are  all of you 
stay right where you are 
ok  captain 
if that ain t a dragon  what is it 
a dragon that runs on diesel engines 
forget the spooks 
you take the driver 
i ll take the headlights and the tyres 
you keep safe out of sight 
  i told you to stay there 
  i was frightened 
come on out 
hands where we can see  em 
and the dame  quick 
unless you want an extra navel 
hold it  drop that gun 
now kick it away from you 
the girl stays where she is 
walk towards me  hands out in front 
come on 
hey  you 
where do you think you re going 
sorry we ain t got any flowers 
come on  let s go 
come on  let s go 
give me that knife 
  leave him alone 
  get out of the way 
get inside 
keep an eye on the man 
and be careful  they ve been
in the swamp and they re contaminated 
check their geiger reading 
  he s reading 95  chief 
  she s 88 
too much for the monitor 
scrub them down  but quick 
  reading 72 8 
  the mud s soaked into their clothes 
all right  then  take off all their clothes 
  what s he going to do 
  do as he says  we re contaminated 
  do the girl first 
  we give the orders around here 
that s fine  but do something
about this  will you  come here 
use the high temperature jets 
full pressure

  all right  put the man through 
he s now clocking 40 
reading 38

you poor dears 
we didn t know when to expect you  first
it was teatime yesterday  then dinner 
it was only half an hour ago
we really knew you were on your way 
cigarette 
american  english  or turkish 
i m sister rose  this is sister lily  we ll
make your stay as pleasant as possible 
  that s most kind of you  but   
  of course  you want to see your rooms 
breakfast is ordered 
and then you ll want to sleep 
the doctor left orders you re not
to be disturbed until this evening 
he ll be delighted if you join him
for dinner  shall i say you will 
  tell him i also will be delighted 
  splendid  i know he ll be pleased 
here we are 
this will be your room  mr bond 
this is your bathroom in here 
and for you  young lady   
this is your room 
you ll find fresh clothes in here 
i hope they fit 
we didn t get your sizes till last night 
don t hesitate to ring
if there s anything at all you want 
such as two air tickets to london 
i ll leave you two dear people in peace 
  let s have some breakfast 
  how can you eat at a time like this 
because i m hungry and we don t know
when we ll get the chance to eat again 
take this 
careful  the whole place
is probably wired for sound 
have you   
have you any idea
what they ll do with us 
no idea 
no door handles or windows  either 
  it s a prison  then 
  mink lined with first class service 
what s the matter 
i don t feel so good 
i feel so sleepy 
damn coffee 
how do you feel 
sleepy 
  what made us pass out like that 
  the coffee  it was drugged 
it s time for dinner 
we mustn t keep the doctor waiting 
that would never do 
you ready  honey 
i suppose so 
you re doing fine 
come on 
am i properly dressed for the occasion 
  quite suitable 
  suitable for what 
this way  please 
i m glad your hands are sweating  too 
of course i m scared  too 
be natural and leave all the talking to me 
in here  please 
i hope you enjoy your dinner 
come and look 
artificial light  we could be
hundreds of feet beneath the sea here 
look at that  sea tulips 
they do not grow above 200ft 
one million dollars  mr bond 
  you were wondering what it cost 
  as a matter of fact i was 
forgive my not shaking hands 
it s awkward with these  a misfortune 
you were admiring my aquarium 
yes  it s quite impressive 
a unique feat of engineering 
if i may say so  i designed it myself 
the glass is convex  ten inches thick 
hence the magnifying effect 
minnows pretending they re whales 
just like you on this island  dr no 
it depends  mr bond  on which side
of the glass you are 
a medium dry martini 
lemon peel  shaken  not stirred 
  vodka 
  of course 
we ll have dinner at once 
there s so much to discuss  so little time 
dr no  you haven t done badly 
considering 
a handicap is what you make of it 
i was the unwanted child
of a german missionary
and a chinese girl of good family 
yet i became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in china 
it s rare for the tongs to trust anyone
who isn t completely chinese 
i doubt they shall do so again 
i escaped to america
with ten million of their dollars in gold 
that s how you financed this operation 
it was a good idea to use atomic power 
i m glad you can handle it properly 
i d hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn t effective 
my work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity 
but not without costs  as you see 
yes 
your power source had
our organisation puzzled for some time 
they are still puzzled 
not any longer 
i sent a complete report 
you ve not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a geiger counter 
but there are so many files
open on you already  dr no 
our own  the cia s   
the one from the tong society
that you robbed 
when trouble comes  you ll find this is
a very small and naked little island 
an expendable little island  mr bond 
when my mission is accomplished 
i destroy it and move on 
but the habit of enquiry is consistent 
you re wondering why  where  when 
i only gratify your curiosity
because you re the one man capable of
appreciating what i have done   
and keeping it to himself 
just a minute  there s no point involving
the girl  she has nothing to do with us 
let her go free 
she ll promise not to talk 
  no  i m staying with you 
  i don t want you here 
i agree  this is no place
for the girl  take her away 
no 
  no 
  i m sure the guards will amuse her 
let me go 
that s a dom pérignon  55 
it would be a pity to break it 
i prefer the  53 myself 
clumsy effort  mr bond 
you disappoint me 
i m not a fool 
so please do not treat me as one 
and that table knife  please put it back 
we can t all be geniuses  can we 
does the toppling of american missiles
really compensate for having no hands 
missiles are the first step
to prove our power 
our power  your disregard for human life
means you must be working for the east 
east  west   just points of the compass 
each as stupid as the other 
  i m a member of spectre 
  spectre 
special executive for counterintelligence 
terrorism  revenge  extortion 
the four cornerstones of power  headed
by the greatest brains in the world 
correction  criminal brains 
the successful criminal brain
is always superior  it has to be 
why become criminal  the west would
welcome a scientist of your calibre 
the americans are fools 
they refused my services 
so did the east 
now they can both pay for their mistake 
world domination 
that same old dream 
our asylums are full of people
who think they re napoleon or god 
you persist in trying to provoke me 
i could ve had you killed in the swamp 
and why didn t you 
i thought you less stupid 
usually  when a man gets in my way   
but you were different 
you cost me time  money  effort 
you damaged my organisation 
and my pride 
i was curious to see what you were like 
i thought there might be
a place for you with spectre 
i m flattered 
i d prefer the revenge department 
of course  my first job would be finding
the killer of strangways and quarrel 
unfortunately i misjudged you 
you are just a stupid policeman   
whose luck has run out 
they re waiting for you
in the control room  dr no 
no hurry  they won t have started
their countdown check yet 
you won t get away with it this time 
the americans are prepared for trouble
