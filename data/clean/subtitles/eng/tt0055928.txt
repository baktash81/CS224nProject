but dont stop trying now
whats all this todo about
strangways it looks serious
weve been burning the air between here
and jamaica for the last three hours
in you go
dont forget to write
good evening sir
it happens to be 3am
when do you sleep 007
never on the firms time sir
sit down
jamaica went off the air
in the middle of the opening procedure
weve checked up
and strangways has disappeared
so has his secretary
wed only just sent her out there
was strangways on something special
an inquiry from the americans
there is massive interference
with their cape canaveral rockets
they think it comes
from the jamaica area
does toppling mean anything to you
a little
throwing the controls of a guided missile
off balance with a radio beam
five million dollars worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the south atlantic
and finishing up in the brazilian jungle
is bad enough
but now theyre gonna try orbiting
a rocket round the moon
the american cia sent a man down
to work with strangways
a fellow by the name of leiter
ive heard of him but never met him
has he found out anything important
youd better ask him
youre on the 7 oclock plane to kingston
that gives you exactly
three hours 22 minutes
armourer
youll get the background papers
at the airport in a selfdestructor bag
you can study them during the flight
i want to know
whats happened to strangways
sir
take off your jacket
give me your gun
this damn beretta again
ive told you about this before
you tell him for the last time
nice and light in a ladys handbag
no stopping power
any comments 007
i disagree ive used a beretta for
ten years and never missed with it yet
but it jammed on your last job
and you spent six months in hospital
a doubleo number means youre
licensed to kill not get killed
since ive been head of ml7 theres
been a 40 drop in doubleo casualties
i want it to stay that way
youll carry the walther
unless youd prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties
no sir i would not
then from now on
you carry a different gun show him
walther ppk 765 mil with a delivery
like a brick through a plateglass window
takes a brausch silencer
with little reduction in muzzle velocity
the cia swear by them
thank you major boothroyd
thank you sir
any questions 007
no sir
all right best of luck
thank you sir
007
sir

miss moneypenny forget
the usual repartee 007s in a hurry

curious old strangways
just vanishing like that
or is it cherchez la femme
his secretary was very nice indeed
did you know her
ive seen her around
none of you can throw any light
on what happened to him
his conversation any hint
i never heard him talk about anything
but biggame fishing and bridge
he got the fishing bug three weeks ago
hes been out practically every day since
it must have cost him something
these fishermen ask the earth to charter
and quarrels the most expensive of all
quarrel
a cayman islander
he keeps a boat in the harbour
i see
thank you
excuse me
where do i find quarrel
he him
your name quarrel
maybe
im a friend of commander strangways
aint that nice
i like people whos friends of people
i thought you might be able
to tell me what happened to him
as far as i know nothing happened
unless you know different
where did you take him in your boat
you see that captain
that theres the caribbean
thats where fishing
im interested in fishing
id like to charter your boat
its not for hire
seems i came to the wrong address
thats all right
if youll excuse me
i got business to attend to
pussfeller
well if it aint my friend
what gets addresses mixed
you got the right one this time
if you likes good eating
i do if the conversation matches it
back at the boat too public
in there it different
after you
sure thing
hey man you see we get some privacy
nothing but quarrel
take a seat
im fine
ok mister
supposin you start the conversation
hows about it
aint no use you struggling
pussfeller wrestles alligators
right up slowly and face that wall
hold it
gently bud gently
lets not get excited
frisk him
nothing
interesting
where were you measured for this
my tailor savile row
is that so mines a guy in washington
felix leiter
central intelligence agency
you must be james bond
you mean were fighting the same war
when i saw you leave the airport with
the opposition i figured i must be wrong
this is quarrel
no hard feelings i hope
only a sore hand glad to know you
pussfeller owns the place
i hope he cooks better than he fights
nobody died from my cooking  yet
there you are
cape canaveral is screaming
they dont want anything to go wrong
with this moon rocket launch
yet strangways didnt think
the interference came from here
i suppose you cased the joint
i checked unofficially
you limeys can be touchy
about trespassing
strangways and quarrel
checked the islands
you found nothing
where did you look
just about everywhere
fire island crab key morgans reef
checked them all thoroughly
all except crab key we had no right
why not
it belongs to a chinese
get her quarrel and the camera
evening missis
youre hurting
the captain wants you
to have a drink with us
youre hurting me
you cant mean it
good evening
why do you want another picture of me
i only got your hat at the airport
tell this ape to let me go
why do you want a picture at all
because thats the way i earn my living
who pays you
the daily gleaner
pussfeller pussfeller

ever seen this girl before
she come here sometimes
you want for me to get rid of her
no just ring the gleaner find out
if they sent a photographer here tonight
they didnt send me i work freelance
freelance for whom
you
tell us and hell stop
we dont get nothing out of this gal
you want me to break her arm
another time
the second time nothings come out
give her her arm back
run along freelance
youll be sorry
youll all be sorry you rats
one takes cyanide another would have
had her arm broken neither would talk
who puts that sort of scare into people
i think maybe wed better find out fast
you were talking about crab key
why cant we go there
it belongs to a chinese character
he wont allow anyone to land
i had our naval reconnaissance planes
take a look
they found nothing but a bauxite mine
lowscan ch radar setup
theres nothing illegal about that
crab key scares me plenty
friends of mine went out
there once after seashells
only trouble they never came back again
the local fishermen wont go near it
strangways and me we slip in at night
he take some samples we came straight
back dont do to hang about there
what kind of samples
bits of rock sand water
i see
crab key begins to interest me
what else do we know
about this chinese gentleman
nothing much except his name
dr no
id like to see professor dent

ive heard rumours
but no ones complained officially
miss taro just leave them here
we cant find them anywhere
what do you mean who had them last
commander strangways both files

damn nuisance
their disappearing like that
on the contrary
id have been surprised if they hadnt
by the way that came for you
from london in the diplomatic pouch
a present from home
can i get out that way
thats a naughty habit
listening at keyholes
i wasnt listening
i was looking for those files
anything that cant be found
i get the blame
forget it
its not very important anyhow
id hate to think you were spending
all afternoon looking for them
no i have the afternoon off
theres a coincidence so have i
why dont you show me round the island
what should i say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman
you should say yes
i should say maybe
three oclock at my hotel maybe
yes maybe
good
the luminous dial activates it
hold this
where exactly did
strangways place those samples
about where your feet is sir
good
hi there
hi
lose something
take a look at this geiger reading
those samples strangways brought back
from crab key were radioactive
yet professor dent told me they were
worthless chunks of iron ore
hes either a bad professor or a poor liar
i intend to find out which
quarrel how soon can you
get us over to crab key
well its like this here captain
strangways he done take samples
of all the islands
we could check the nearest ones first
no its crab key im interested in
i done take the commander there
we got away without trouble
it dont do for a man
to tempt providence too often
you see theres a dragon
what
native superstition
started by dr no probably
all right quarrel we wont force you
leiter and i will go after dark
if youll give us directions
i gets my navigational directions
from my nose my ears  my instincts

strangways samples were radioactive

someone is
we cant have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here
he doesnt just try
im pretty sure he killed my father
what do you mean by that
you see my father
was a marine zoologist
we came to the caribbean
for him to study seashells
then one day he came to crab key
and i never saw him again
they said he must have been drowned
but he was far too good a diver for that
didnt the police investigate
or your family
they investigated for a long time
then they said
missing presumed dead
i havent got any family
there was only my father and me
you mean youre here all alone
where did you live before
all over the world
the philippines bali hawaii
anywhere there were shells
you went to school somewhere
no need we had an encyclopedia
i started at a when i was eight
and now ive reached t
i bet i know a lot more things than you do
didnt anyone in kingston help
well there was this man who owned
the place where we were living
he let me stay on
for a while without paying
then one night he came up
to my room well you know
i scratched his face and then
but he was stronger than i was
what happened after that
i put a black widow spider
underneath his mosquito net
a female and theyre the worst
it took him a whole week to die
did i do wrong
well it wouldnt do to make a habit of it
do you have a woman of your own
captain quick down here

this time i want to see it
and hurry
theres less than 12 hours to go

one million dollars mr bond
you were wondering what it cost
as a matter of fact i was
forgive my not shaking hands
its awkward with these a misfortune
you were admiring my aquarium
yes its quite impressive
a unique feat of engineering
if i may say so i designed it myself
the glass is convex ten inches thick
hence the magnifying effect
minnows pretending theyre whales
just like you on this island dr no
it depends mr bond on which side
of the glass you are
a medium dry martini
lemon peel shaken not stirred
vodka
of course
well have dinner at once
theres so much to discuss so little time
dr no you havent done badly
considering
a handicap is what you make of it
i was the unwanted child
of a german missionary
and a chinese girl of good family
yet i became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in china
its rare for the tongs to trust anyone
who isnt completely chinese
i doubt they shall do so again
i escaped to america
with ten million of their dollars in gold
thats how you financed this operation
it was a good idea to use atomic power
im glad you can handle it properly
id hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasnt effective
my work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity
but not without costs as you see
yes
your power source had
our organisation puzzled for some time
they are still puzzled
not any longer
i sent a complete report
youve not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a geiger counter
but there are so many files
open on you already dr no
our own the cias
the one from the tong society
that you robbed
when trouble comes youll find this is
a very small and naked little island
an expendable little island mr bond
when my mission is accomplished
i destroy it and move on
but the habit of enquiry is consistent
youre wondering why where when
i only gratify your curiosity
because youre the one man capable of
appreciating what i have done
and keeping it to himself
just a minute theres no point involving
the girl she has nothing to do with us
let her go free
shell promise not to talk
no im staying with you
i dont want you here
i agree this is no place
for the girl take her away
no
no
im sure the guards will amuse her
let me go
thats a dom pérignon 55
it would be a pity to break it
i prefer the 53 myself
clumsy effort mr bond
you disappoint me
im not a fool
so please do not treat me as one
and that table knife please put it back
we cant all be geniuses can we
does the toppling of american missiles
really compensate for having no hands
missiles are the first step
to prove our power
our power your disregard for human life
means you must be working for the east
east west  just points of the compass
each as stupid as the other
im a member of spectre
spectre
special executive for counterintelligence
terrorism revenge extortion
the four cornerstones of power headed
by the greatest brains in the world
correction criminal brains
the successful criminal brain
is always superior it has to be
why become criminal the west would
welcome a scientist of your calibre
the americans are fools
they refused my services
so did the east
now they can both pay for their mistake
world domination
that same old dream
our asylums are full of people
who think theyre napoleon or god
you persist in trying to provoke me
i couldve had you killed in the swamp
and why didnt you
i thought you less stupid
usually when a man gets in my way
but you were different
you cost me time money effort
you damaged my organisation
and my pride
i was curious to see what you were like
i thought there might be
a place for you with spectre
im flattered
id prefer the revenge department
of course my first job would be finding
the killer of strangways and quarrel
unfortunately i misjudged you
you are just a stupid policeman
whose luck has run out
theyre waiting for you
in the control room dr no
no hurry they wont have started
their countdown check yet
you wont get away with it this time
the americans are prepared for trouble
