if that s the case 
are you unable to escape
from this fortress  
that s a good question 
why have i let the supreme being
keep me here   
in the fortress
of ultimate darkness  
  because you  
  oh  shut up 
i m speaking rhetorically 
  of course 
  i let him keep me here   
in order to lull him
into a false sense of security 
ah  clever  clever

     singing  
  midnight sunshine  
  silence under sky
is black as day  
  only a dream away  
     singing  
  waking while you re still
deep sleeping  
  finding you re not here  
  watchin  a dream appear  
  tumbling through  
  a thousand centuries  
  you don t know
where you ll land  
  lt s so dark in mythology  
  treasures of history  
  to be found  
  within the legends of time  
  all the handiworks we made  
  were only a dream away  
     singing  
  greedy feeling  
  wheeling  dealing  
  losin  what you won  
  see the dream come undone  
  stumble you may
with your mentoring  
  lucky you got so far  
  all you owe is apologies  
  measure the mystery  
  and the sound  
  lt s like taking up time  
  lt shows the handiworks
we ve made
