    of their fangs son 
or was it 8 feet and 20 minutes   
  oh  ma

the precinct presented me with this
howlitzer when i retired 
sure wouldn t want to go looking for
those pythons without it 
if it s all the same to you
bob carter     
i ll put my faith in the good lord
and a little gunpowder 
rather than in coyotes and
rattlesnakes    
this place must be crawling with
them 
how are you taking this

i hate it out here 
just uncomfortable  that s all 
it s more than uncomfortable   
lynne  honey  could you get me my
jacket  please

fresh air is unhealthy

we d be in california now if
we d stayed on the interstate 
oh  showers     and gin and tonics    
the beach    
i wonder what s bugging her 
maybe there s some rattlesnakes
prowling around    
you know what freud would say about
your obsession with rattlesnakes ma

beast never barks until he s ready
for the kill 
he likes to catch his victims
unawares

bobby    
  good lord  how are you     
back in  29 
this place was spanking new 
me and my wife martha had    
a baby so cuddly and so pretty
we couldn t believe 
and another kid on the way 
but when martha had this one 
something went wrong 
this thing she gave me    something
happened    he was so big 
he came out sideways and almost tore
poor martha apart 
he weighed 20 pounds and
was hairy as a monkey 
when he was 10 years old 
he was big as i was 
accidents would happen all the time 
dogs falling into wells 
i even found chickens with their
heads bitten off 
then in august of  39  i was in town
getting supplies 
the whole damn house burned
to the ground 
my little baby girl was a cinder
when i found her 
but this monster kid wasn t even
singed  i knew he d done it 
i hit him with a tyre iron and
i split his face wide open 
how bad was it 
i thought i d killed him  i was afraid
they d come and take me away 
so i took him out on that desert and
i left him there 
i figured if he wasn t dead 
he couldn t live more than two hours
out there in that heat 
then it would all be over with 
and you think his ghost is still
trying to track you 
that was a long time ago 
long enough for him to steal a whore
that nobody would miss 
long enough to raise a pack
of wild kids 
long enough for a devil kid
to grow up and be a devil man 
what the hell is this 
that s some stuff    
you want some cheese on this 
there s plenty left 
i don t want anything 
what s the matter 
don t you feel well 
i m just not hungry 
your face still bothering you 
no  did anybody try the cv while
i was gone 
we tried  we tried  nothing

sounded like an obscene caller
