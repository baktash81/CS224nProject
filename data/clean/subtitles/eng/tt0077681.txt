bobby
good lord how are you
back in 29
this place was spanking new
me and my wife martha had
a baby so cuddly and so pretty
we couldnt believe
and another kid on the way
but when martha had this one
something went wrong
this thing she gave me something
happened he was so big
he came out sideways and almost tore
poor martha apart
he weighed 20 pounds and
was hairy as a monkey
when he was 10 years old
he was big as i was
accidents would happen all the time
dogs falling into wells
i even found chickens with their
heads bitten off
then in august of 39 i was in town
getting supplies
the whole damn house burned
to the ground
my little baby girl was a cinder
when i found her
but this monster kid wasnt even
singed i knew hed done it
i hit him with a tyre iron and
i split his face wide open
how bad was it
i thought id killed him i was afraid
theyd come and take me away
so i took him out on that desert and
i left him there
i figured if he wasnt dead
he couldnt live more than two hours
out there in that heat
then it would all be over with
and you think his ghost is still
trying to track you
that was a long time ago
long enough for him to steal a whore
that nobody would miss
long enough to raise a pack
of wild kids
long enough for a devil kid
to grow up and be a devil man
what the hell is this
thats some stuff
you want some cheese on this
theres plenty left
i dont want anything
whats the matter
dont you feel well
im just not hungry
your face still bothering you
no did anybody try the cv while
i was gone

sounded like an obscene caller

breathing didnt it mum
