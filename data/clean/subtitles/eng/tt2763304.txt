i am sorry 
a blow 
no two ways about that 
five more years  eh 
what do they think i am 
they think i m like one of those cunts
in the bible that live forever 
is that what they think 
 i m not sure  they make an assessment 
 i ve written letters  you know 
letters to every cunt 
even wrote to the queen 
 you ve written to the queen 
 aye 
never got back to us  like 
too fucking busy to speak
to the working classes 
different story when she needs a soldier 
 step this way  mr  begbie  
 sign here  mr  begbie  
i didn t know you d served in the army 
i haven t  how could i 
i ve been in the fucking jail for 20 years 
 you not fucking notice 
 of course  of course 
diminished responsibility 
if that cunt in the original trial had put on
a proper defense
of diminished responsibility 
i could ve walked out that door a free man 
i think  for you  that the best policy   
did you mention it 
the diminished responsibility 
did you mention it 
 at the hearing 
 aye  did you 
 i felt it was more constructive   
 didn t fucking mention it 
i cannot believe it 
what was the last fucking thing i told you 
mind and mention
the diminished responsibility 
you fucking dumb cunt 
i think it would be better
if we brought this meeting to a close 
and you and i get together
once you ve had time
to reflect upon the situation 
so you gonna press
that little yellow button or no 
cunt 
daylight saving 
me  i m no one way or another
when it comes to daylight 
like  neither a saver nor a spender 
more like just agnostic  you know 
unfortunately  daylight hasn t shown
the same ambivalence towards me 
i had a job    construction 
laboring  a bit of carpentry 
a bit of plumbing now and again 
i mean  it wasn t my first choice of vocation 
but the cuts at the benefit office
made it clear 
no coal  no dole 
so  i m off the skag 
i m seeing gail  little fergus 
though he s not so little anymore 
but this was back then 
basically  i m holding it together 
then  one morning  i gets to work
and gets fired for being an hour late 
and then  one hour late at the dss
to explain why i lost the job 
and an hour late to appeal
against losing my benefits 
and an hour late
for my work focused interview 
an hour late for
my supervised visit with little fergus 
and late again to
social services to explain why 
eventually  i let on to it  it was the clocks 
going forward one hour 
british summer time  they calls it 
it wasn t even warm 
i was still wearing a jumper 
 happens every year  mr  murphy  
how was i supposed to know 
i ve been on skag for 15 years 
you know how it is   
daylight isn t exactly high on your agenda
when you got a habit 
it s for farmers and that 
dudes who need to tend to the livestock 
it s not for junkies who need to score 
so that was me  no job  no money 
no access to the little fella 
and then you went back on the heroin 
my best friend 
actually  only friend who s never left us 
what is this 
 this is for you 
 what 
it s a recording 
a keepsake so the memory need never fade 
 who are you 
 i m your blackmailer 
and your salvation 
you cooperate with me 
no one will ever see this video 
now  my research suggests that 
as deputy headmaster of one of
edinburgh s leading private schools 
you earn  near enough   70 000 per annum 
it s not in my interest
to squeeze you too hard 
and it s not in your interest to provoke me 
so let s meet in the middle 
10  of your salary per annum 
paid monthly on a rolling  indefinite basis 
you disgusting shit  i will not stand for this 
naturally  you ll have to lie to your wife 
if you need inspiration 
just imagine her reaction to that 
or how this might interest
the pupils of that leading private school 
i think they might enjoy
the interlude with the strap on 
i know i did 
i m gonna text you the details
of a bank account 
i expect to see a  1 000 payment in there
by the end of the week

a light had shone in the night
somewhere ahead
and blue had turned into green
then it was red   
this place is a goldmine  it s a certainty 
i mean  these are people who ve been
abandoned by their political class 
but at least they have what we don t   
a sense of identity 
right  come on  let s get it over with 
an identity encapsulated in four digits 
if we re not back in an hour  call the police 
 what shall i say 
 just tell them we re dead 
each machine seemed to say
as i walked round and round
the penny arcade
and just ring the bell on the big bagatelle   
the battle of the boyne
was fought on the 11th of july  1690 
between two rival claimants of
the british and irish thrones 
james ii  catholic 
and william of orange  protestant 
the battle was decisive 
the protestants won 
but 400 years later 
the uncompromising and victorious loyalists
now feel estranged from the
modern  secular united kingdom 
let me tell you that i love you
and i think about you all the time
the sectarian songs have been banned 
but they still gather
and remain loyal to the victory of 1690 
and to a simpler  less tolerant time 
it s the greatest sight that i have ever seen
you are a red hot
you re a red hot dancer
when you swing your hips
and you do the salsa
rock forward and back
then you do it again
take a grapevine to the right   
but if nothing else 
history has shown us very clearly
these are people
whom it is unwise to provoke 
you aren t from  round here 
are you  lads 
you not gonna give us a song 
i can sing  i ll just   
i ll just fucking make something up 
you can play the piano 
i can t play the fucking piano 
you know those two chords 
the fucking f and g march
you used to play at school 
do that 
good evening 
my mate and i would like to
sing a song that we wrote 
no 
is    is that it 
it was the year of 1690
on the 11th of july
or the first in julian calendar
wait  wait  wait 
give me something with a little bit of rhythm 
here we go 
it was on the field of battle
of hope we were bereft
but by the time that it was over
there were no more catholics left
we looked up to king william
on his chin a royal cleft
and by the time that it was over
there were no more catholics left
aye  fucking right 
his strategy was strong
his strategy was deft
by the time that it was over
there were no more catholics left
the battle now victorious
we foiled his papist theft
when the time was over
there were no more catholics left
aye 
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
 no more
 no more
 no more
 no more
 no more
 no more
 no more
 no more
 no more
 no more
no more catholics left
thank you very much  good night 
just fucking drive 
one six nine zero 
one six nine zero 
sixteen ninety 
 nope 
 nope 
and it s midnight 
start again 
so  there s this room service guy  right 
and he comes into the room 
and there is georgie best
lying on the bed with two playboy models 
three in a bed  champagne
and a little bit of charlie 
and there s banknotes 
but they re lying on the banknotes 
 lying on the money 
 yes 
 why 
 i don t know 
because he has a lot of money 
or at least he had
a lot of money at the time  anyway 
the room service guy  he comes in 
and he sees this scene
that i just described to you 
and he says   george best    
greatest footballer of all time 
exactly   the greatest footballer of all time 
i have to ask you 
  where did it all go wrong   
where did it all go wrong 
where did it all go wrong 
 where did it all go wrong  george best 
 yeah  but   
i think that the room service guy  you know   
i think he makes a very good point 
no 
he played for hibs in 1979
between stints for
the fort lauderdale strikers
and the san jose earthquakes 
i went to see him play  apparently 
my dad took me 
he said   you ve got to see this 
you ve got to see this player 
 got to see this greatest footballer
of all time  
so it was a big game  it was a big crowd 
and a big guy in front of me 
i couldn t see a thing  not a single thing 
not for 90 minutes 
but i ve got the program  so   
i mean  i ve always got that  you know 
thin  thin  nobody was fat back then 
it s not just the football  is it 
 it s the end of austerity 
 there was no such thing even
 as a calorie till 1974 
 welcome to the new age of
 civil rights  space exploration 
 you know what happened in 1974 
the first mcdonald s in the uk 
he s basically john barry
with football boots 
see  look at that guy 
he would be scrawny today 
a great  swaggering  filthy piece of music 
 but then    that was totally normal till 1974 
 it s insurrection 
 that s the beauty of what he does 
 you know what happened in 1974 
first mcdonald s  south london  woolwich 
these are not goals 
these are political statements 
it s still there 
i ve been there myself several times 
you know nothing  you understand nothing 
you live in the past 
where i come from
the past is something to forget
but here it s all you talk about 
you are clearly so in love with each other
that i feel awkward in your company 
instead of looking at me
you should get naked and fuck each other 
cheers

that s really good 
well done 
so  are you the woman in the video 
my face is not seen 
do you have any identifying marks 
tattoos on your buttocks 
certainly not 
on your perineum 
it s the bit of skin
between your vagina and your bumhole 
that s disgusting 
so you re not vajazzled 
may i ask 
what is your relationship with the accused 
we are friends 
mark 
i really don t have anything else to add 
well   
perhaps we have a defense 
simon may claim that
the recording was consensual 
was  in fact 
commissioned by the complainant 
hence the request for payment 
he pleads guilty on the cocaine 
which  remarkably  is a first offense 
enters into an approved rehab 
 1 000 fine  six months suspended 
this consultation is free 
should we go forward  here s the cost 
well  that s very reasonable 
it s an hourly rate 
 course 
thanks 
mark 
she s too young for you 
here it is 
 eu small business development loans 
 zero interest loans distributed regionally
 towards projects that stimulate regeneration
of formerly industrial areas 
 loans are available of up to  100 000 
 applications should be made online 
 which may be followed by an invitation
to present a business plan  
blah  blah  fucking blah 
i m trying to help you  simon 
we re blowing all that
cashpoint money on lawyer s fees 
you could ve got someone cheaper 
well  i wouldn t have had to get anyone at all
if you hadn t engaged in fucking blackmail 
is there anything left of your  4 000
i gave you 
no  i ve got expenses  just like everyone else 
what  all of it 
you snorted the whole fucking wad 
it s called debt  mark 
the point is  we need cash now 
not in six months  time 
and you realize what s at stake here 
i promised to set up a sauna for veronika 
and if i don t get it up and running soon 
she s gonna leave me 
 fucking leave you anyway 
 no  it s not gonna happen 
 is she actually even with you 
 she s my girlfriend 
you ve never even fucked her 
i have fucked her  and i ll fuck her again 
 what  when she was working at the sauna 
 that s not fair 
you know  since we re having
this conversation 
i can tell you that fully consensual 
emotionally driven  not for profit
sexual intercourse has been attained 
simon  you re a romantic 
veronika and i have had our rough patches 
i ll be the first to admit that 
shall we submit this application 
do what you want 
but i need someone on site working 
i need progress 
now 
all right  spud  we re upstairs 
 all right  mark 
 come in 
when clients come in 
i want a sense of space 
yeah 
maybe some soft lighting  help punters feel
a bit more relaxed and that  you know 
exactly  i m so glad
that someone understands 
and they re off and racing 
woody bay was a little awkward
out of the stalls and also to gather stride 
out well towards the right 
fine  n  dandy is racing solo early on 
steventon star down the center
with jacob s pillow 
hello  franco 
simon 
 but you re not   
 i m out 
  out  
 aye  fucking shut up 
yeah  sorry if i seemed a little shocked
to see you  frank  it s just   
well  i was gonna   
i was gonna deal with this myself
and then give you the good news  but   
you re not gonna believe this 
so  two days ago 
i got a call from an old friend of mine 
gav temperly  you remember him 
aye 
anyway 
he s on business in amsterdam 
and he s in a cafe one morning 
and he hears this voice beside him 
a whiny  cunty voice 
no 
so he turns around  right 
this is two fucking days ago 
i m just getting over it myself 
 there he is 
 holy fucking moly 
hasn t changed in 20 years 
very same smug  little cunty grin
across his ugly face 
 for fuck s sake 
 aye  renton 
mark fucking renton 
living in amsterdam
all this time on our money 
 cunt  did renton clock him 
 no 
so gav followed him 
he went into an office block
not far from the center of town 
and gav had to split then 
but he s gonna go back 
he s gonna hang out 
he s gonna follow renton home  and then   
 and we re gonna pay him a visit 
 exactly 
 i need a passport 
 i can get you one 
i ll take some weapons 
well  we can probably get
weapons there  franco 
aye  probably  they ve got
that kind of stuff in amsterdam  eh 
aye  now  the important thing
is for you to keep your head down 
low profile till the passport comes through 
till i get the tickets 
  cause this is an opportunity  frank 
 right 
i m gonna fucking tear him to pieces 
you most definitely fucking will 
simon and i do not sleep together 
no  i had wondered 
once  but   
i m his girlfriend  but it s business  really 
simon is not a good person 
but i like him 
more than he likes himself  i think 
right  but if you re not   
if there s no physical aspect
to your relationship 
i mean  you don t want to be  like   
you know  wasting your time 
what s  choose life  
 what 
  choose life  
simon says it sometimes 
he says   choose life  veronika  
 choose life  
 choose life  was a well meaning slogan
from a 1980s antidrug campaign 
and we used to add things to it 
so i might say  for example  choose   
designer lingerie
in the vain hope of kicking some life
back into a dead relationship 
choose handbags 
choose high heeled shoes 
cashmere and silk
to make yourself feel what passes for happy 
choose an iphone made in china
by a woman who jumped out of a window 
and stick it in the pocket of your jacket
fresh from a south asian firetrap 
choose facebook  twitter 
snapchat  instagram
and a thousand other ways to spew your bile
across people you ve never met 
choose updating your profile 
tell the world what you had for breakfast
and hope that someone  somewhere cares 
choose looking up old flames 
desperate to believe that
you don t look as bad as they do 
choose live blogging
from your first wank to your last breath 
human interaction reduced
to nothing more than data 
choose ten things you never knew
about celebrities who d had surgery 
choose screaming about abortion 
choose rape jokes 
slut shaming  revenge porn 
and an endless tide of depressing misogyny 
choose 9 11 never happened 
and if it did  it was the jews 
choose a zero hour contract
and a two hour journey to work 
and choose the same
for your kids  only worse 
and maybe tell yourself it s better
that they never happened 
and then sit back and smother the pain
with an unknown dose of an unknown drug
made in somebody s fucking kitchen 
choose unfulfilled promise
and wishing you d done it all differently 
choose never learning
from your own mistakes 
choose watching history repeat itself 
choose the slow reconciliation
towards what you can get
rather than what you always hoped for 
settle for less and keep a brave face on it 
choose disappointment 
and choose losing the ones you loved 
and as they fall from view 
a piece of you dies with them 
until you can see that one day in the future 
piece by piece  they will all be gone 
and there ll be nothing left
of you to call alive or dead 
choose your future  veronika 
choose life 
anyway  it amused us at the time 
i like you  mark 
fuck 
what are you gonna do 
i m going to be the madame
in simon s bordello 
but really   
what are you gonna do 
i don t know  i should go home 
but   
to go home with nothing 
no qualification  no career 
not even bringing money 
what s at home 
you know 
emotional attachment 
that s all 
 all set 
 yeah  fine  you re okay 
 aye 
 sure 
 why 
 nothing 
 why  what s happened 
 no  nothing s happened  i m just   
i m just enjoying us working together 
that s all 
good  so   
 shall we go in  right 
 aye 
jesus 
this is the renovation and conversion
of an iconic leith building 
we see it very much as being an artisanal
bed and breakfast experience 
a destination in its own right 
artworks by local artists on the walls 
locally sourced fresh food 
outreach programs to inspire children
in school to think outside the box 
to inspire in them a belief that   
yes  they can 
there was a time when this port
served thousands of ships around the globe 
now it can rise again 
and we believe our business
will occupy a central role 
both physically and emotionally 
at the heart of this new wave
of regeneration in leith 
leith 2 1 
exactly 
we used to steal all this stuff 
fancy wallpaper 
sell on to the middle classes and that 
me and mark used to steal
all kinds of stuff  actually 
till we got caught 
he got off  i got six months 
still  you find out what you re good at inside 
signatures    that s what i found out 
anyone s  if i seen it once  i can do it 
so  when i got out   bye bye  shoplifting 
hello  checkbook  hello  check card  
up to western union 
signature  cash in hand 
up to swanney s 
pay off my debts  buy some skag 
i was a portable fucking goldmine 
so  what happened 
chip and pin  debit cards  e banking 
billionaires moving money
at the touch of a button 
there s no room
for an honest artisan like me anymore 
so  what did you do 
back on the pavement  seven days a week 
i like your stories 
i think you should write them down 
you think 
yeah  just write them the way you say them 
they re funny  i would like to read them 
mark and simon can help 
 tommy looks well 
 it s terrifying 
 he s gonna die 
 sometime between the next few weeks
and the next 15 years 
 tommy will be no more 
 chances are that i ll be exactly the same 
 difference is we know this with tommy 
 tommy cannot get out 
 he cannot afford to heat his home 
 put himself in a bubble 
 live in the warm  eat good fresh food 
 keep his mind stimulated
with new challenges 
 he will only live five or 10 or 15 years
before he is crushed 
 tommy will not survive winter
in west granton  
well  i m trying hard  mark 
but i m not feeling anything 
we were young  bad things happened 
it s over 
can we go home now 
 two hours to the next train 
 oh  for fuck s sake 
look  we re here as an act of memorial 
nostalgia 
that s why you re here 
you re a tourist in your own youth 
just  cause you had a near death experience 
and now you re feeling all fuzzy and warm 
what other moments will you be revisiting 
here s a good one 
how about the time you sold
tommy his very first hit 
leading him on to heroin addiction 
hiv infection 
and ultimately his death at the age of   
what was it  22  23 
 twenty three 
 twenty three 
how innocent was that 
aye  that s mine 
how s yours 
don t know what you re talking about 
she d be a woman by now 
maybe kids of her own 
but she never got that far  did she 
never got to lead her life 
because her father 
someone who should have been
looking after her 
protecting his own infant 
was too busy filling
his own veins with heroin
to check that she was breathing properly 
how do you keep a lid on that one 
well  that s that  then 
here we go 
fuck s sake

in a casual backhand motion 
 the glass crashes down on this girl s head 
 which splits open as she falls to her knees 
 begbie s on his feet and we re racing
down the stairs  and he shouts
