i am sorry
a blow
no two ways about that
five more years eh
what do they think i am
they think im like one of those cunts
in the bible that live forever
is that what they think
im not sure they make an assessment
ive written letters you know
letters to every cunt
even wrote to the queen
youve written to the queen
aye
never got back to us like
too fucking busy to speak
to the working classes
different story when she needs a soldier
step this way mr begbie
sign here mr begbie
i didnt know youd served in the army
i havent how could i
ive been in the fucking jail for 20 years
you not fucking notice
of course of course
diminished responsibility
if that cunt in the original trial had put on
a proper defense
of diminished responsibility
i couldve walked out that door a free man
i think for you that the best policy
did you mention it
the diminished responsibility
did you mention it
at the hearing
aye did you
i felt it was more constructive
didnt fucking mention it
i cannot believe it
what was the last fucking thing i told you
mind and mention
the diminished responsibility
you fucking dumb cunt
i think it would be better
if we brought this meeting to a close
and you and i get together
once youve had time
to reflect upon the situation
so you gonna press
that little yellow button or no
cunt
daylight saving
me im no one way or another
when it comes to daylight
like neither a saver nor a spender
more like just agnostic you know
unfortunately daylight hasnt shown
the same ambivalence towards me
i had a job construction
laboring a bit of carpentry
a bit of plumbing now and again
i mean it wasnt my first choice of vocation
but the cuts at the benefit office
made it clear
no coal no dole
so im off the skag
im seeing gail little fergus
though hes not so little anymore
but this was back then
basically im holding it together
then one morning i gets to work
and gets fired for being an hour late
and then one hour late at the dss
to explain why i lost the job
and an hour late to appeal
against losing my benefits
and an hour late
for my workfocused interview
an hour late for
my supervised visit with little fergus
and late again to
social services to explain why
eventually i let on to it it was the clocks
going forward one hour
british summer time they calls it
it wasnt even warm
i was still wearing a jumper
happens every year mr murphy
how was i supposed to know
ive been on skag for 15 years
you know how it is
daylight isnt exactly high on your agenda
when you got a habit
its for farmers and that
dudes who need to tend to the livestock
its not for junkies who need to score
so that was me no job no money
no access to the little fella
and then you went back on the heroin
my best friend
actually only friend whos never left us
what is this
this is for you
what
its a recording
a keepsake so the memory need never fade
who are you
im your blackmailer
and your salvation
you cooperate with me
no one will ever see this video
now my research suggests that
as deputy headmaster of one of
edinburghs leading private schools
you earn near enough 70000 per annum
its not in my interest
to squeeze you too hard
and its not in your interest to provoke me
so lets meet in the middle
10 of your salary per annum
paid monthly on a rolling indefinite basis
you disgusting shit i will not stand for this
naturally youll have to lie to your wife
if you need inspiration
just imagine her reaction to that
or how this might interest
the pupils of that leading private school
i think they might enjoy
the interlude with the strapon
i know i did
im gonna text you the details
of a bank account
i expect to see a 1000 payment in there
by the end of the week

oh fucking shut up
a light had shone in the night
somewhere ahead
and blue had turned into green
then it was red
this place is a goldmine its a certainty
i mean these are people whove been
abandoned by their political class
but at least they have what we dont
a sense of identity
right come on lets get it over with
an identity encapsulated in four digits
if were not back in an hour call the police
what shall i say
just tell them were dead
each machine seemed to say
as i walked round and round
the penny arcade
and just ring the bell on the big bagatelle
the battle of the boyne
was fought on the 11th of july 1690
between two rival claimants of
the british and irish thrones
james ii catholic
and william of orange protestant
the battle was decisive
the protestants won
but 400 years later
the uncompromising and victorious loyalists
now feel estranged from the
modern secular united kingdom
let me tell you that i love you
and i think about you all the time
the sectarian songs have been banned
but they still gather
and remain loyal to the victory of 1690
and to a simpler less tolerant time
its the greatest sight that i have ever seen
you are a red hot
youre a red hot dancer
when you swing your hips
and you do the salsa
rock forward and back
then you do it again
take a grapevine to the right
but if nothing else
history has shown us very clearly
these are people
whom it is unwise to provoke
you arent from round here
are you lads
you not gonna give us a song
i can sing ill just
ill just fucking make something up
you can play the piano
i cant play the fucking piano
you know those two chords
the fucking f and g march
you used to play at school
do that
good evening
my mate and i would like to
sing a song that we wrote
no
is is that it
it was the year of 1690
on the 11th of july
or the first in julian calendar
wait wait wait
give me something with a little bit of rhythm
here we go
it was on the field of battle
of hope we were bereft
but by the time that it was over
there were no more catholics left
we looked up to king william
on his chin a royal cleft
and by the time that it was over
there were no more catholics left
aye fucking right
his strategy was strong
his strategy was deft
by the time that it was over
there were no more catholics left
the battle now victorious
we foiled his papist theft
when the time was over
there were no more catholics left
aye
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more catholics
no more
no more
no more
no more
no more
no more
no more
no more
no more
no more
no more catholics left
thank you very much good night

sixteenninety

nope
and its midnight
start again
so theres this room service guy right
and he comes into the room
and there is georgie best
lying on the bed with two playboy models
three in a bed champagne
and a little bit of charlie
and theres banknotes
but theyre lying on the banknotes
lying on the money
yes
why
i dont know
because he has a lot of money
or at least he had
a lot of money at the time anyway
the room service guy he comes in
and he sees this scene
that i just described to you
and he says george best
greatest footballer of all time
exactly the greatest footballer of all time
i have to ask you
where did it all go wrong
where did it all go wrong
where did it all go wrong
where did it all go wrong george best
yeah but
i think that the room service guy you know
i think he makes a very good point
no
he played for hibs in 1979
between stints for
the fort lauderdale strikers
and the san jose earthquakes
i went to see him play apparently
my dad took me
he said youve got to see this
youve got to see this player
got to see this greatest footballer
of all time
so it was a big game it was a big crowd
and a big guy in front of me
i couldnt see a thing not a single thing
not for 90 minutes
but ive got the program so
i mean ive always got that you know
thin thin nobody was fat back then
its not just the football is it
its the end of austerity
there was no such thing even
as a calorie till 1974
welcome to the new age of
civil rights space exploration
you know what happened in 1974
the first mcdonalds in the uk
hes basically john barry
with football boots
see look at that guy
he would be scrawny today
a great swaggering filthy piece of music
but then that was totally normal till 1974
its insurrection
thats the beauty of what he does
you know what happened in 1974
first mcdonalds south london woolwich
these are not goals
these are political statements
its still there
ive been there myself several times
you know nothing you understand nothing
you live in the past
where i come from
the past is something to forget
but here its all you talk about
you are clearly so in love with each other
that i feel awkward in your company
instead of looking at me
you should get naked and fuck each other

youd have stabbed us there
id be lying breathing my last
through a hole in my chest
but you cannot fucking do that
what do you want
yep
mark
what
need a lawyer
so as i understand it
the complainant a deputy headmaster
alleges that hes been
the victim of attempted extortion
how does sick boy intend to plead
its actually simon these days
right simon
i see not guilty
fine
off the record
the police have told me that the usb drive
does have simons prints on it
and that in searching the flat
they found the mobile
that the bank details were sent from
right
as well as the cocaine of course
well that was just for personal use
quite a lot for personal use
well you know simon
i certainly remember him
does he still take heroin
no
do you
no not for 20 years
thats really good
well done
so are you the woman in the video
my face is not seen
do you have any identifying marks
tattoos on your buttocks
certainly not
on your perineum
its the bit of skin
between your vagina and your bumhole
thats disgusting
so youre not vajazzled
may i ask
what is your relationship with the accused
we are friends
mark
i really dont have anything else to add
well
perhaps we have a defense
simon may claim that
the recording was consensual
was in fact
commissioned by the complainant
hence the request for payment
he pleads guilty on the cocaine
which remarkably is a first offense
enters into an approved rehab
1000 fine six months suspended
this consultation is free
should we go forward heres the cost
well thats very reasonable
its an hourly rate
course
thanks
mark
shes too young for you
here it is
eu small business development loans
zerointerest loans distributed regionally
towards projects that stimulate regeneration
of formerly industrial areas

blah blah fucking blah
im trying to help you simon

if you hadnt engaged in fucking blackmail

and if i dont get it up and running soon
shes gonna leave me
fucking leave you anyway
no its not gonna happen
is she actually even with you
shes my girlfriend
youve never even fucked her
i have fucked her and ill fuck her again
what when she was working at the sauna
thats not fair
you know since were having
this conversation
i can tell you that fully consensual
emotionally driven notforprofit
sexual intercourse has been attained
simon youre a romantic
veronika and i have had our rough patches
ill be the first to admit that
shall we submit this application
do what you want
but i need someone onsite working
i need progress
now
all right spud were upstairs
all right mark

a bit more relaxed and that you know
exactly im so glad
that someone understands
and theyre off and racing
woody bay was a little awkward
out of the stalls and also to gather stride
out well towards the right
fine n dandy is racing solo early on

yeah sorry if i seemed a little shocked
to see you frank its just
well i was gonna
i was gonna deal with this myself
and then give you the good news but
youre not gonna believe this
so two days ago
i got a call from an old friend of mine
gav temperly you remember him
aye
anyway
hes on business in amsterdam
and hes in a cafe one morning
and he hears this voice beside him
a whiny cunty voice
no
so he turns around right
this is two fucking days ago
im just getting over it myself
there he is
holy fucking moly
hasnt changed in 20 years
very same smug little cunty grin
across his ugly face
for fucks sake
aye renton
mark fucking renton
living in amsterdam
all this time on our money
cunt did renton clock him
no
so gav followed him
he went into an office block
not far from the center of town
and gav had to split then
but hes gonna go back
hes gonna hang out
hes gonna follow renton home and then
and were gonna pay him a visit
exactly
i need a passport
i can get you one
ill take some weapons
well we can probably get
weapons there franco
aye probably theyve got
that kind of stuff in amsterdam eh
aye now the important thing
is for you to keep your head down
low profile till the passport comes through
till i get the tickets
cause this is an opportunity frank
right
im gonna fucking tear him to pieces
you most definitely fucking will
simon and i do not sleep together
no i had wondered
once but
im his girlfriend but its business really
simon is not a good person
but i like him
more than he likes himself i think
right but if youre not
if theres no physical aspect
to your relationship
i mean you dont want to be like
you know wasting your time
whats choose life
what
choose life
simon says it sometimes
he says choose life veronika
choose life
choose life was a wellmeaning slogan
from a 1980s antidrug campaign
and we used to add things to it
so i might say for example choose
designer lingerie
in the vain hope of kicking some life
back into a dead relationship
choose handbags
choose highheeled shoes
cashmere and silk
to make yourself feel what passes for happy
choose an iphone made in china
by a woman who jumped out of a window
and stick it in the pocket of your jacket
fresh from a south asian firetrap
choose facebook twitter
snapchat instagram
and a thousand other ways to spew your bile
across people youve never met
choose updating your profile
tell the world what you had for breakfast
and hope that someone somewhere cares
choose looking up old flames
desperate to believe that
you dont look as bad as they do
choose liveblogging
from your first wank to your last breath
human interaction reduced
to nothing more than data
choose ten things you never knew
about celebrities whod had surgery
choose screaming about abortion
choose rape jokes
slut shaming revenge porn
and an endless tide of depressing misogyny
choose 911 never happened
and if it did it was the jews
choose a zerohour contract
and a twohour journey to work
and choose the same
for your kids only worse
and maybe tell yourself its better
that they never happened
and then sit back and smother the pain
with an unknown dose of an unknown drug
made in somebodys fucking kitchen
choose unfulfilled promise
and wishing youd done it all differently
choose never learning
from your own mistakes
choose watching history repeat itself
choose the slow reconciliation
towards what you can get
rather than what you always hoped for
settle for less and keep a brave face on it
choose disappointment
and choose losing the ones you loved
and as they fall from view
a piece of you dies with them
until you can see that one day in the future
piece by piece they will all be gone
and therell be nothing left
of you to call alive or dead
choose your future veronika
choose life
anyway it amused us at the time
i like you mark
fuck
what are you gonna do
im going to be the madame
in simons bordello
but really
what are you gonna do
i dont know i should go home

im just enjoying us working together
thats all
good so
shall we go in right

jesus
this is the renovation and conversion
of an iconic leith building
we see it very much as being an artisanal
bedandbreakfast experience
a destination in its own right
artworks by local artists on the walls
locally sourced fresh food
outreach programs to inspire children
in school to think outside the box
to inspire in them a belief that
yes they can
there was a time when this port
served thousands of ships around the globe
now it can rise again
and we believe our business
will occupy a central role
both physically and emotionally
at the heart of this new wave
of regeneration in leith
leith 21
exactly
we used to steal all this stuff
fancy wallpaper
sell on to the middle classes and that
me and mark used to steal
all kinds of stuff actually
till we got caught
he got off i got six months
still you find out what youre good at inside
signatures thats what i found out
anyones if i seen it once i can do it
so when i got out byebye shoplifting
hello checkbook hello check card
up to western union
signature cash in hand
up to swanneys
pay off my debts buy some skag
i was a portable fucking goldmine
so what happened
chip and pin debit cards ebanking
billionaires moving money
at the touch of a button
theres no room
for an honest artisan like me anymore
so what did you do
back on the pavement seven days a week
i like your stories
i think you should write them down
you think
yeah just write them the way you say them
theyre funny i would like to read them
mark and simon can help
tommy looks well
its terrifying
hes gonna die
sometime between the next few weeks
and the next 15 years
tommy will be no more
chances are that ill be exactly the same
difference is we know this with tommy
tommy cannot get out
he cannot afford to heat his home
put himself in a bubble
live in the warm eat good fresh food
keep his mind stimulated
with new challenges
he will only live five or 10 or 15 years
before he is crushed
tommy will not survive winter
in west granton
well im trying hard mark
but im not feeling anything
we were young bad things happened
its over
can we go home now
two hours to the next train
oh for fucks sake
look were here as an act of memorial
nostalgia
thats why youre here
youre a tourist in your own youth
just cause you had a neardeath experience
and now youre feeling all fuzzy and warm
what other moments will you be revisiting
heres a good one
how about the time you sold
tommy his very first hit
leading him on to heroin addiction
hiv infection
and ultimately his death at the age of
what was it 22 23
twentythree
twentythree
how innocent was that
aye thats mine
hows yours
dont know what youre talking about
shed be a woman by now
maybe kids of her own
but she never got that far did she
never got to lead her life

was too busy filling
his own veins with heroin
to check that she was breathing properly
