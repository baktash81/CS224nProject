such a stupid request 
you re just a stinking 
useless weakling 
and this is certainly
no place for humans 
it s a bathhouse for the spirits 
it s where they come
to replenish themselves 
and you humans always make
a mess of things  like your parents   
who gobbled up the food
of the spirits like pigs 
they got what they deserved 
and you should be punished too 
you could be a piglet 
or maybe you d prefer
a lump of coal 
i can see you shaking

spoiled crybaby   
and you have no manners 
this is a high class place
i m running here 
so there s no job for you

you saw how tacky her home is 
we re identical twins 
yet exact opposites 
i m sorry she turned
your parents into pigs

more of a hint than that 
it seems like i met haku before 
but it was a long time ago
