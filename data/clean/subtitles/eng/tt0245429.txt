a lump of coal

do you have any idea what this is
yes its the golden seal
you were looking for
im here to apologize for haku
im very sorry
he sliced me in two you know
and im still angry
what
what the protective spell is gone
im sorry you mean that black slug
that was on your seal
i think i squashed it with my foot
squashed it
that wasnt my slug
my sister put that slug into haku
so she could control him
you squashed it
what happened to my spell
only love can break it
come now
can you please turn these two
back into their normal forms
the spell on those two
wore off long ago
change back if you want
i dont get along with my sister
shes so obnoxious
you saw how tacky her home is
were identical twins
yet exact opposites
im sorry she turned
your parents into pigs
but theres nothing i can do
its just the way things are
youll have to help
your parents and haku on your own
use what you remember about them
what cant you please give me
more of a hint than that
it seems like i met haku before
but it was a long time ago
thats a good start
once youve met someone
you never really forget them
it just takes a while
for your memories to return
while youre thinking the boys and i
are going to make you something
