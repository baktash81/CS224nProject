  right on  right on 
put your hands together 
my people  for our kwame ture 
thank you  sister patrice 
  thank you 
  and the black student union 
i want to thank all of you 
my beloved sisters
and brothers 
for coming out tonight 
okay 
but i m here tonight
to tell you
that it is time
for you to stop running away
from being black 
boom shaka laka 
it is time for you to stop
running away from being black 
you re college students  right 
  right on 
  that s right 
you should think 
it is time for you
to understand that you 
as the growing intellectuals
of this country 
that you must define beauty
for black people 
  okay 
  now  that s black power 
let me ask you something   
is beauty defined
as someone with a narrow nose 
  no 
  thin lips 
no 
white skin 
  uh uh 
  hell no 
  hell no 
  hell no 
 cause you ain t got
none of that 
no  okay 
our lips are thick 
  yes 
  yes  they are 
our noses broad 
  our hair is nappy 
  yes 
we are black 
and we are beautiful 
  yes 
  boom shaka laka 
you see 
we want to be so much like
the white people
who oppress us in this country 
  nope 
  and because they hate us 
and because we are ashamed
of our african heritage 
we then hate ourselves 
preach 
y all don t hear me tonight 
we hear you 
y all dig tarzan 
tarzan 
i m gonna be honest 
when i was a boy  i used to go
to the saturday matinees
and watch tarzan all the time 
  okay 
  yeah  yeah 
and white tarzan used to
beat up the black natives 
mmm  mm hmm 
and i would sit there 
yelling   kill the beasts 
 kill the savages 
 kill them 
kill them  kill them 
kill them  
but what i was saying was 
 kill me  
that s right 
it was as if a young jewish boy
saw nazis
taking jews off
to concentration camps
and cheered them on 
today  i want those chiefs
to beat the hell out of tarzan
and send his lily white ass
on back to the caves of europe 
  boom shaka laka 
  right on 
right on 
but it takes time 
it takes time to become free
of the lies
and their shaming effects
on the black mind 
  okay 
  it takes time to reject
the most important lie 
that black people
can t do the same things
  that white people do   
  that s a lie 
   unless a white person
helps them 
talk about it 
black power also
means that we must unite 
we must unite 
and we must organize
to form a base to fight racism 
  okay 
  yes  yes 
to fight our oppressors 
the vast majority of negroes
around this country 
they live
in captive communities 
and they must endure
their oppression
and their conditions 
because and only because
  they are black and powerless 
  educate  educate 
and now   
now we are being shot down
like dogs in the streets
by white racist cops 
speak the truth 
i said we are
being shot down
in the streets
by white racist cops 
fuck the police 
we can no longer endure
this kind of oppression
without retribution 
hell no 
no more 
that war in vietnam 
it is not only illegal 
it is immoral 
  that s right 
  talk about it 
and you know what i tell them 
hell no    we won t go 
hell no  we won t go 
hell no 
we won t go 
hell no  we won t go 
hell no 
we won t go 
hell no  we won t go 
hell no 
we won t go 
hell no  we won t go 
hell no 
we won t go 
  hell no  we won t go 
  we ain t going 
i d rather see a brother
kill a white racist cop
than kill a vietnamese 
me  too 
because at least 
if he kills a racist cop 
he is doing it for a reason 
because they are shooting
black people   
  that s right 
     in the backs 
in these streets  right here
in this very country 
  they re killing us like dogs 
  boom shaka laka 
right here 
right here 
i just want to leave you 
uh  in closing
 cause i know it s getting late
and y all gotta go party 
i m sorry  study

that they were going to have to
arm themselves and kill cops

a white officer   
to play me
when they meet face to face

sorry about these guys 
they re a little  uh 
too friendly sometimes 
they just get excited 
yeah 
what kind of beer you like 
coors  if you got it 
that was interesting 
not exactly
the beverly hillbillies 
they liked you 
except for that felix guy 
do not ride his bumper
like that 
two car lengths 
you think he got
a good look at my face 
probably 
you get the papers 
they want you to join 
uh  technically 
they want you to join 
yeah 
yeah  they want a black man
to join the ku klux klan 
i d say that s
mission impossible 
double success 
we re in 
slow down  brother 
slow down 
and exactly how much should we
be worried about them 
enough that we d like
to dig deeper 
one of the men discussed plans
for a possible attack  so   
i wouldn t give him
that much credit 
these guys like to boast 
what kind of attack 
uh  ivan   
ivanhoe said  boom   mentioned
something about fireworks 
but personally 
i didn t buy it 
i i doubt they re even capable 
either way  at this point 
we re looking for full support
from the department
on this  sarge 
let s move on
with the investigation 
let s try to find out if
they are capable of anything 
okay 
  thank you  sarge 
  you got it 
when we dropped brother kwame
off at the airport 
he told me
that the black power movement
needed strong sisters like me
to lead the fight
against capitalist oppression
and the politicians and pigs
who perpetuate it 
his words almost made that
whole pig nightmare worthwhile 
  and there s a girl
in this harbor town  
  and she works
layin  whiskey down     
what s wrong 
what do you mean 
what s wrong 
i don t really use that word 
what word 
 pigs  
well  what else
would you call them 
cops 
police 
officers 
a bunch of racist cops
on a power trip 
so  you think all cops
are racist 
it only takes one
to pull a trigger
on an innocent sister
or brother 
hmm 
why were you
at brother kwame s speech 
  he s got some good ideas 
  mm hmm 
i don t agree with all of them 
but he s a smart brother 
definitely worth hearing 
are you down for the liberation
of black people 
do we always have
to talk politics 
what s more important 
do you ever take time off 
no  it s a lifetime job 
sister angela davis 
most righteous sister 
can we please spend
some quality time together 
and what did you say
your j o b is 
sister kathleen cleaver 
i didn t 
are you a pig 
excuse me 
are you a pig 
you mean a cop 
are you a cop 
no 
i m in construction 
but more importantly 
i m a black man
who wants to get to know
a strong 
intelligent  beautiful sister 
the very one
i m looking at right now 
  but he had always
told the truth  
  lord  he was
an honest man     
you dig 
sure enough 
that s what i m talking about 
power to the people 
all power to all the people 
  that s right  sister 
  right on  right on 
  this is walter 
  ron here 
this is ron 
sorry  your voice sounds
different over the phone 
uh   
my allergies   
allergies acting up again 
i get those all the time 
listen  wanted to tell you
that it was a real pleasure
to have you swing by 
i think the brothers
really took a liking to you 
i m honored 
if you re free saturday 
why don t you swing by felix s 
you can meet the rest
of the brotherhood  hmm 
  sounds good to me 
  well  i will see you then 
i ve got a friend 
he  uh  keeps up
with these groups 
he says they re moving away
from the old violent 
racist style 
so  that s what duke
is peddling now 
it s  uh  becoming mainstream 
  duke 
  david duke 
current grand wizard
of the klan 
but he s always in
a three piece suit 
never seen in a hood
or robe in public 
and he now goes by
 national director  
so he s clearly got his sights
on higher office 
  politics  how so 
  yeah 
think it s another way
to sell hate 
  keep going 
  think about it 
affirmative action 
immigration 
  crime  tax reform 
  hmm 
he says no one wants
to be called a bigot anymore 
i guess archie bunker
made that too uncool 
so the idea is 
under all these issues 
everyday americans
can accept it 
support it 
until eventually  one day 
he gets somebody in the
white house that embodies it 
sarge   
come on 
america would never elect
somebody like david duke
president of
the united states of america 
coming from a black man 
that s pretty naive 
why don t you wake up 
ron  hi 
i m connie  felix s wife

oh 
  want to come right in 
  sure 
  do you mind if i  uh  smoke in there

ooh  bernie casey 
brother s strong 
but cleopatra jones is the one 
it s about time
we started seeing
  a strong sister like that

real life s not like that 
real life is no
cleopatra jones or coffy 
what  you don t
dig pam grier 
she s fine as red wine
and twice as mellow 
pam grier is doing her thing 
but in real life  it s just
pigs killing black folks 
what if there was a cop
trying to change that 
from inside 
yes  from inside 
you can t change things
from the inside 
it s a racist system 
you just give up like that 
no  we fight for what
black people really need   
  black liberation 
  right  right 
so  can t you do that
from the inside 
no  you can t 
the white man won t give up
his position in power
without a struggle 
what did du bois say
about double consciousness 
twoness 
being an american and a negro 
two warring ideals
inside one dark body 
that s heavy  patrice 
i feel that   
like i m two people
all the time 
but you shouldn t have to be 
we shouldn t have a war
going on inside ourselves 
we should just be black 
we re not there yet  though

about being jewish 
nobody around me was jewish 
you know  i wasn t going
to a bunch of bar mitzvahs 
i didn t have a bar mitzvah 
i was just another white kid 
and now i m in some basement
denying it out loud 
i never thought much about it 
now i m thinking about it
all the time 
about   
rituals and heritage 
is that passing 
well  then i   
well  then i have been passing 
i don t want that 
  it sounds like they re watching us 
  i don t know 
i was asleep  i don t know 
i don t know what
we re supposed to do 
look at this bullshit 
where d you find these 
plastered all over
my windshield 
but they re all over
the neighborhood  too 
is this real 
real as can be 
intimidation 
clearly  this is about the
black student union and you 
  me 
  well  you ve been outspoken
about the incident
with the police
when brother kwame was here 
so  next  they ll have
a burning cross out front 
all right  they re just
trying to get to you 
intimidate  like you said 
fear tactics 
if you don t let  em scare you 
they got nothing 
but keep your eyes open 
be cool  okay 
that s the damn problem 
we always too cool 
way too cool 
well  maybe we should
call the police 
how we know this ain t
some of the kkk s
honky pig partners
passing out this shit 
let me ask you    excuse us 
  let me ask you something 
  excuse us for what 
 cool   want me to be cool 
i ll be cool 
and it also safeguards
against the cspd 
which is nice 
yeah 
yeah  you soak the wood
in kerosene and   
light a cig
on a pack of matches 
it kind of buys you some time
to get the fuck out
before the cross catches fire 
yeah 
must be quite a sight 
oh  yeah  it is 
it s great 
it s a real bonfire 
you can see it from miles away 
you know 
good visibility  as walter
would say 
freaks out the jew media 
and it   
well  it keeps niggers
on their nigger toes 
oh  look at that 
damn  there s another one 
the pigs are   
pigs are out tonight  yeah 
good job 
send another one 
lot of these guys in the army 
uh  we got a couple 
we got    got a few
on active duty  yeah 
i just finished
my second tour in  nam 
  no shit 
  yeah 
my guy 
hey  ron  do you happen
to know anything about c 4 
you being in the military
and all 
enough to make shit blow up 
   program dares
to love white people 
white heritage
and white freedom 
this program also dares
to expose
  the jewish supremacism   
  here come my boys 
here come the cavalry 
   and the criminal
banking establishment 
these criminal bankers 
the criminal fed 
the establishment is   
they re ethnically
cleansing our people 
not only in the united states 
not only in
the united states 
the only    the only thing
that we hear today
from politicians   
y all  cross burning is off 
too many cops  goddamn it 
 right 
thank you  black people 
i love black people  
and  of course 
every politician   
every politician
has to talk and genuflect
to the real rulers
of our society and say 
 i want to thank
the jewish people 
i love the jewish people  
and   the jewish people
are always our friends
 no matter what they do 
 no matter how much
they destroy our country 
 it s just wonderful 
you know  we just love
the jews  
and no senator or congressman
would dare get up and say 
 i love white people 
 i love white heritage 
 i love my people 
and i love the culture
 that was created in europe 
 and this great western 
christian civilization 
 i want to see that persevere 
you know  i want to see that
be enriched  
a lot of people think
i hate negroes  but i don t 
and the organization doesn t 
either 
they just need to be
with their own 
that s what pinky would say 
pinky didn t mind
segregation one bit 
she just wanted to be
with her own kind 
sounds like she was
a mammy to you 
you ever seen
gone with the wind 
pinky was my hattie mcdaniel 
she won the oscar
for that role 
you know 
best supporting actress  so   
you were scarlett 
and she was mammy 
that s right 
  right 
  that s funny 
when she passed  it was like   
well  it was like we lost
a member of the family 
a good nigger
is funny like that 
in that sense 
they re like a good dog 
they get real close to you 
and as soon as you lose  em 
it just breaks your heart 
that s well said  ron 
  i knew a coon once 
  did you 
yeah  that negro lived
across the street from us 
i must have been   
six or seven 
his nickname
was butter biscuit 
how d he get that nickname 
he loved his mama s
butter biscuits 
yum  yum 
me and butter biscuit
played together every day 
one day  my father
came home early from work 
he told me i couldn t play
with that little spook anymore
because i was white
and butter biscuit
was a nigger 
that s so rich 
well  your father sounds
like a terrific man 
he was a true american 
taught me what was right 
this is why we need
more people like you and me
in public office   
get this country back on track 
amen 
for america to achieve its   
uh  its greatness again 
absolutely

and kevin nelson 
two clowns with top
security clearances 
these klansmen are in charge
of monitoring our safety 
you ve done a service
to your country 
we ve been following
your investigation 
impressive 
last night 
fort carson reported
several c 4 explosives
missing from their armory 
  no suspects 
  klan 
wait  the kkk
and the united states army 
you won t see this on the news
for obvious reasons  but   
thought it might be
of interest to you 
if you know
about a possible attack 
i need to know when 
you re the one with
the impressive investigation 
but can t you
or the fbi chip in 
sir 
fbi 
federal bureau
of investigation 
we never had this conversation 
you can hate me all you want 
all right 
just promise me you won t go
to that protest 
i m going  we re going 
wh what are you talking about 
i can t get into specifics 
but today the klan
is planning an attack 
then we have to tell
the people 
it s not an option 
ungawa  black power 
what s wrong with you 
no one else can know while it s
an active investigation 
active investigation 
and pray tell 
how do you know that 
are you a pig 
no 
wh what are you  then 
ungawa  black power 
ungawa  black power 
ungawa  black power 
want to sit 
no  i ll stand 
ungawa  black power 
ungawa  black power 
i m an undercover detective 
i m investigating the klan 
fucking kkk 
ron stallworth  you lied to me 
is that even your real name 
ron stallworth
is my first and last name 
look  today is not the day 
patrice 
i take my duties
as the president
of the black student union
seriously 
well  how much good did it do 
you could sit in the middle
of nevada avenue 
light yourself on fire 
the kkk will still be here 
well  at least i would be
doing something  unlike you 
  unlike me 
  yeah 
don t think  just because
i don t wear a black beret
or a black leather jacket 
black ray bans 
screaming   kill whitey  
that i don t care
about my people 
the night we saw
brother kwame speak 
were you undercover then  too 
that s not fair 
  you have to understand   
  answer the question 
were you undercover
the night we met 
yes or no 
ron stallworth 
are you for the revolution
and the liberation
of black people 
i m an undercover detective for
the colorado springs police 
it s my j o b

a j o b  too 
you disgust me 
my brother 
you need to wake up 
ungawa  black power 
ungawa  black power 
are you fucking kidding me 
you don t cross those lines 
this is about an investigation 
not a relationship

what 
felix just said the march
has been canceled 
why 
could be all the death threats 
no  they re used to that 
and there s been nothing more
about the explosives 
no 
fuck it 
we get  em on weapons charges
and stop them
from doing anything that way 
then what 
you know  misdemeanor at best 
  then they walk 
  i have a special assignment for ron 
ron already has an assignment 
yeah  what could be
more important
than preventing an attack  sir 
we have
very credible threats
against david duke s life 
so  ron  i am assigning you
security detail
  for david duke 
  what 
with all due respect  sir 
i don t think
this is a wise decision 
given the situation 
who cares what you think 
duke needs protection 
there s no one else available 
nut cracking time 
put aside
your personal politics 
chief  it s not about that 
and you know it 
david duke and ron
have been talking
on the phone several times 
if he recognizes his voice   
if if    if if any
of the klansmen do 
it ll compromise
our entire investigation 
  it s too dangerous 
  correct me if i m wrong 
but didn t you boast to me
that you were fluent
in both english and jive 
do you remember that 
answer the chief 
oh  shut the fuck up  landers 
you know  you ve been trying
to sabotage me since day one 
why are you getting
so worked up  boy

how nervous i was gonna be 
oh

they got to guard mr  duke 
isn t that the living shit 
gentlemen   
it s time 
  ron  why don t you follow me 
  okay 
ah ah ah ah 
let s go  let s go 
you stay right here 
you hear 
ah   
god  america s going to hell
in a handbasket 
that started out
as a nice spring day
back there in waco  texas 
may 15  1916 
jesse washington   
   was a friend of mine 
he was 17 
i was 18 
we kind of looked at jesse
and called him slow 
today   
you d call him
mentally retarded 
they claimed jesse   
raped and murdered
a white woman
by the name of lucy fryer 
they put jesse on trial 
and he was convicted
by an all white jury
after they deliberated
for only four minutes 
my brothers in christ 
nobel prize recipient 
co creator of the transistor
and a dear 
dear friend of mine 
dr  william shockley 
whose groundbreaking
scientific work
ushered in the computer age 
has proven  through his research
with eugenics 
that each of us here
has flowing through our veins
the genes of a superior race 
it s a fact 
it s a fact 
it can t be disputed 
today  we celebrate that truth 
masks off  hoods on 
i was working across the street
at the shoeshine parlor 
and after the verdict 
a mob grabbed jesse 
put a chain
around his neck and   
   dragged him out
of the courthouse 
oh  my god 
i knew i had to hide 
that way 
be careful  brother 
well  all right 
where i was  the shoe parlor
had a window up in the attic 
and i could see the crowd 
they marched jesse
through the streets 
they stabbed him and beat him 
and finally  in a bloody heap 
they held him down
in the street   
   and cut off his testicles 
god   
give us true white men 
the invisible empire
demands strong minds 
great hearts  true faith 
clean and ready hands 
men who have honor 
men who will not lie 
men who can stand
before a demagogue
and damn his treacherous
flatteries without blinking 
god  give us real men 
courageous men
who flinch not at duty 
men of dependable character 
men of sterling worth 
then wrongs will be redressed 
and right shall rule the earth 
god  give us true white men 
ron stallworth 
rise 
step forward 
the police
and the city officials
were out there watching him 
they cut off his fingers 
and threw coal oil
all over his body 
they lit a bonfire
and raised him and lowered him
over these flames
over and over and over again 
ron stallworth 
are you a white 
non jewish american citizen 
yes 
yes    what 
yes  i am a white 
non jewish american citizen 
are you in favor
of a white man s government
  in this country 
  yes 
ron stallworth  are you willing
to dedicate your life
to the protection 
the preservation
and the advancement
of the white race
in mind  in body
  and in spirit 
  yes 
be seated 
the mayor had a photographer
by the name of gildersleeve 
he came and took pictures
of the whole thing 
those pictures were later sold
as postcards 
remove your hood 
they put jesse s
charred body into a bag 
remove your hood 
dragged him through town 
remove your hood 
they sold the remains 
remove your hood 
as souvenirs 
remove your hood 
lot of good white folks
just stood there
like it was
a fourth of july parade 
they even let the children
out of school
on lunch hour 
remove your hood 
and all i could do was to   
watch and hope
they wouldn t find me 
come 
welcome your brethren
who have been baptized
by the light 
  please 
  oh  my god 
let s give them some applause 
one of the reasons
they had done that to jesse
was a movie
called birth of a nation 
it had come out
the year before 
and it was so powerful
that it gave the ku klux klan
a rebirth 
oh  god  oh  my god 
oh  my god  no 
no 
oh  look at that one 
oh  he s disgusting  oh 
oh  those poor women 
don t you do it  oh 
  why 
  no 
no  oh 
the ingenuity of white women 
oh 
today  they would call
that kind of movie
a blockbuster 
everybody saw it 
that s disgusting 
even the president
of the united states 
woodrow wilson 
showed it at the white house
