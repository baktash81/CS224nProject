and special effects
while the world he inhabits is
in some respects counterfeit

if i die before the summit use me
as an alternative source of food

i dont know what to think marlon
maybe im losing my mind
it feels like the whole world
revolves around me
thats a lot of world for one man
is it wishful thinking wishing
youd made more out of yourself
who hasnt sat in the john and
had an imaginary interview on tv
this is different
everybody seems to be in on it
ive been your best friend
since we were seven
we got through school by cheating
off each others test papers
jesus they were identical
but i always felt safe knowing that
because whatever the answer was
we were right or wrong together
i stayed up all night in your tent
so you could play north pole
and i got pneumonia
remember that
you were out of school for a month
youre the closest thing i ever had
to a brother truman
things havent worked out for us
like we used to dream they would
i know what that feelings like
everything slipping away
you dont want to believe it so you
look for answers somewhere else
but the point is id gladly
walk in front of traffic for you
but the points id gladly
step in front of traffic for you
and the last thing id ever do
is lie to you
and the last thing that
i would ever do is lie to you
i mean think about it
if everybody is in on it
id have to be in on it too
im not in on it truman
because there is no it
you were right about one thing
whats that
the thing that started all this
i found him for you truman
thats why i came by tonight
im sure hes got
quite a story to tell
go to him
easy on the fog
stand by cranecam
cranecam
buttoncam three
i never stopped believing
go wide curbcam eight
my son
move in for closeup
no no
stay back
fade up music
now go for the closeup
all those years wasted
ill make it up to you son
i swear
dad
bravo
congratulations
okay quiet down concentrate
that was great television
christ of it was brilliant
it broke my heart
well done congratulations
truman drinks mococoa
worlds finest cocoa beans
grown on the upper slopes
of mt nicaragua
1 7 billion were there
for his birth
220 countries tuned in
for his first step
the world stood still
for that stolen kiss
and as he grew so did the
technology a human life
recorded on a network of
hidden cameras and broadcast live
24 hours a day seven days a week
to an audience around the globe
from sea haven enclosed in the
largest studio ever constructed
one of only two manmade
structures visible from space
now in its 30th great year
its the truman show
what a week i was on
pins and needles the entire time
im your host mike michelson
welcome to truetalk our forum for
issues growing out of the show
tonight something very special
an exclusive interview
with the shows creator
lets go live to the 221stfloor
of the omnicam ecosphere
there well find
the worlds greatest televisionary
the designer of the world within
a world thats sea haven christ of
id like to thank you
for granting this interview
we know your schedule is demanding
and how you guard your privacy
this sir is indeed an honor
dont mention it
the catalyst
for the recent dramatic events
has been trumans father kirk
and his attempt at in filtration
this is not the first time someone
has tried to reach truman is it
we have had our close calls
its television
i did it im on the truman show
but now the first intruder
to be a former cast member
a dead one at that
writing kirk back in brilliant
kirk started this whole crisis he
was the only one who could end it
truman no
thats off limits
why whats over there
nothing its dangerous thats all
you have to know your limitations
lets remind viewers why dad was
written outin the first place
as truman grew up we manufactured
ways to keep him on the island
id like to be a great explorer
theres nothing left to explore
then i thought up kirks drowning
hes feared the water ever since
when kirk read the synopsis he was
disappointed to say the least
im sure
thats why he broke onto the set
but how do you intend to explain
his 22year absence
amnesia
brilliant
lets take some viewer calls north
carolina youre on with christ of
hi christ of i was wondering how
many cameras you got in that town
somewhere in the vicinity of5000
remember we started with just one
he was two weeks premature as if
he couldnt wait to get started
and his eagerness to leave the womb
was the reason he was selected
in competition with five other
unwanted pregnancies
for a show determined by an air
date only truman arrived on cue
i believe truman is the first child
to be adopted by a corporation
thats correct
the shows made enormous revenue
equivalent to the gnp
ofa small country
it takes the population ofan
entire country to keep it running
since its on 24 hours revenues are
generated byproduct placement
everything on the show is for sale
down to the very homes they live in
all of tin the truman catalogue
operators are standing by
christ of why has truman
never come close to discovering
the true nature of his world
until now
we accept the reality of the world
with which were presented
the hague for christ of hello
the hague
all right
lets go to hollywood california
youre a liar and a manipulator and
what youve done to truman is sick
well we remember this voice
dont we how could we forget
lets go to another call
no no its fine mike
i love to reminisce
with former members of the cast
sylvia as you announced so
melodramatically to the world
do you think because you batted
your eyes at truman once
flirted with him
stole a few minutes of air time
to thrust your politics into
the limelight that you know him
that you know whats right for him
are you in a position to judge him
what right do you have to
turn a babys life into a mockery
dont you ever feel guilty
i have given truman
the chance to lead a normal life
the world the place you live in
is the sick place sea haven
is the way the world should be
hes a prisoner not a performer
he can leave at any time
if his was more than a vague
ambition if he was determined
to discover the truth theres
no way we could prevent him
i think what distresses you
really caller
is that ultimately truman
prefers his cell as you call it
thats where youre so wrong
and hell prove you wrong
these heated comments aside its
been a very positive experience
for truman and for the viewers
thank you for your time
now that this crisis is behind us
can we look forward
to some exciting new developments
the big news is meryl will leave
truman in an upcoming episode
a new romantic interest
will be introduced
im determined that tvs first
onair conception will take place
another television milestone
it has been a singular honor
and a pleasure christ of thank you
hey simeon
is he looking at us
you think he knows
hello
better call christ of
come in major burbank
hes back to his old self
thats an unusual cat my man
i hereby proclaim this planet
trumania of the burbank galaxy

innocent sunbather stabbed by
the tip of a runaway beach umbrella
