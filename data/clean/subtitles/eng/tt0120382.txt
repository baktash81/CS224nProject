  you re having a nervous breakdown 
you re part of this  aren t you

  i wasn t talking to anybody 
  talk to me 
  i don t know anything 
  stay where you are 
truman    
thank god 
how can anyone expect me to
carry on under these conditions 
it s unprofessional 
everything s gonna be okay 
it s all gonna be fine 
i don t know what to think  marlon 
maybe i m losing my mind 
it feels like the whole world
revolves around me 
that s a lot of world for one man 
is it wishful thinking  wishing
you d made more out of yourself 
who hasn t sat in the john and
had an imaginary interview on tv 
this is different 
everybody seems to be in on it 
i ve been your best friend
since we were seven 
we got through school by cheating
off each others test papers 
jesus  they were identical 
but i always felt safe knowing that 
because whatever the answer was 
we were right or wrong together 
i stayed up all night in your tent
so you could play north pole 
and i got pneumonia 
remember that 
you were out of school for a month 
you re the closest thing i ever had
to a brother  truman 
things haven t worked out for us
like we used to dream they would 
i know what that feeling s like 
everything slipping away   
you don t want to believe it  so you
look for answers somewhere else 
but the point is  i d gladly
walk in front of traffic for you 
but the point s  i d gladly
step in front of traffic for you 
and the last thing i d ever do
is lie to you 
and the last thing that
i would ever do    is lie to you 
i mean  think about it 
if everybody is in on it   
i d have to be in on it  too 
i m not in on it  truman 
because there is no  it  
  you were right about one thing 
  what s that 
the thing that started all this 
i found him for you  truman 
that s why i came by tonight 
i m sure he s got
quite a story to tell 
go to him 
easy on the fog 
stand by  crane cam   
crane cam 
button cam three 
i never stopped believing 
go wide  curb cam eight 
my son 
  move in for close up 
  no  no   
stay back 
fade up music 
now go for the close up 
all those years wasted 
i ll make it up to you  son 
i swear 
dad   
bravo 
congratulations 
  okay  quiet down  concentrate 
  that was great television 
  christ of  it was brilliant 
  it broke my heart 
well done  congratulations 
truman drinks mococoa 
world s finest cocoa beans  
  grown on the upper slopes
of mt  nicaragua 
1  7 billion were there
for his birth 
220 countries tuned in
for his first step 
the world stood still
for that stolen kiss 
and as he grew  so did the
technology  a human life   
  recorded on a network of
hidden cameras and broadcast live  
  24 hours a day  seven days a week 
to an audience around the globe 
from sea haven  enclosed in the
largest studio ever constructed   
  one of only two man made
structures visible from space   
  now in its 30th great year 
it s the truman show 
what a week  i was on
pins and needles the entire time 
i m your host  mike michelson 
welcome to true talk  our forum for
issues growing out of the show 
tonight  something very special 
an exclusive interview
with the show s creator 
let s go live to the 221stfloor
of the omni cam ecosphere 
there we ll find
the world s greatest tele visionary 
the designer of the world within
a world that s sea haven  christ of 
i d like to thank you
for granting this interview 
we know your schedule is demanding 
and how you guard your privacy 
  this  sir  is indeed an honor 
  don t mention it 
the catalyst
for the recent dramatic events  
  has been truman s father  kirk 
and his attempt at in filtration 
this is not the first time someone
has tried to reach truman  is it 
we have had our close calls 
it s television 
i did it  i m on the truman show 
but now  the first intruder
to be a former cast member 
  a dead one at that 
  writing kirk back in  brilliant 
kirk started this whole crisis  he
was the only one who could end it 
truman  no 
  that s off limits 
  why  what s over there 
nothing  it s dangerous  that s all 
you have to know your limitations 
let s remind viewers why dad was
written outin  the first place 
as truman grew up  we manufactured
ways to keep him on the island 
  i d like to be a great explorer 
  there s nothing left to explore 
  then i thought up kirk s drowning 
  he s feared the water ever since 
when kirk read the synopsis  he was
disappointed  to say the least 
i m sure
that s why he broke onto the set 
but how do you intend to explain
his 22 year absence 
  amnesia 
  brilliant 
let s take some viewer calls  north
carolina  you re on with christ of 
hi  christ of  i was wondering how
many cameras you got in that town 
somewhere in the vicinity of5 000 
remember  we started with just one 
he was two weeks premature  as if
he couldn t wait to get started 
and his eagerness to leave the womb
was the reason he was selected 
in competition with five other
unwanted pregnancies  
  for a show determined by an air
date  only truman arrived on cue 
i believe truman is the first child
to be adopted by a corporation 
  that s correct 
  the show s made enormous revenue 
equivalent to the gnp
ofa small country 
it takes the population ofan
entire country to keep it running 
since it s on 24 hours  revenues are
generated byproduct placement 
everything on the show is for sale 
down to the very homes they live in 
all of tin the truman catalogue 
operators are standing by 
christ of  why has truman
never come close to discovering  
  the true nature of his world
until now 
we accept the reality of the world
with which we re presented 
the hague for christ of  hello 
the hague   
all right 
let s go to hollywood  california 
you re a liar and a manipulator  and
what you ve done to truman is sick 
well  we remember this voice 
don t we  how could we forget 
  let s go to another call 
  no  no  it s fine  mike 
i love to reminisce
with former members of the cast 
sylvia  as you announced so
melodramatically to the world   
do you think because you batted
your eyes at truman once   
  flirted with him 
stole a few minutes of air time  
  to thrust your politics into
the limelight  that you know him 
that you know what s right for him 
are you in a position to judge him 
what right do you have to
turn a baby s life into a mockery 
don t you ever feel guilty 
i have given truman
the chance to lead a normal life 
the world  the place you live in   
  is the sick place  sea haven
is the way the world should be 
  he s a prisoner  not a performer 
  he can leave at any time 
if his was more than a vague
ambition  if he was determined  
  to discover the truth  there s
no way we could prevent him 
i think what distresses you 
really  caller   
  is that  ultimately  truman
prefers his cell  as you call it 
that s where you re so wrong 
and he ll prove you wrong 
these heated comments aside  it s
been a very positive experience 
for truman and for the viewers 
thank you for your time 
now that this crisis is behind us   
  can we look forward
to some exciting new developments 
the big news is  meryl will leave
truman in an upcoming episode 
a new romantic interest
will be introduced 
i m determined that tvs first
on air conception will take place 
another television milestone 
it has been a singular honor
and a pleasure  christ of  thank you 
hey  simeon 
  is he looking at us 
  you think he knows 
  hello   
  better call christ of 
come in  major burbank 
he s back to his old self 
that s an unusual cat  my man 
i hereby proclaim this planet
