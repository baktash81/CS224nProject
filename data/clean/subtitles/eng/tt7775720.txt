your mother is realizing
that youre realizing youre gay
you were like 12
eleven twelve
i dont give a yeah she knew
oh my god
my parents still dont know
i mean i had girlfriends
what
right up until after college
they have no idea

why havent you told them
uh um
because it took a long time
for me to accept it myself and
i think it will be tough for them
and i dont think
im ready to tell them i
i dont know
theres a place i dream about
where the sun never goes out
and the sky is deep and blue

impatient
that actually makes a lot of
hold that thought
have you seen the black apple
well i dont know what that means
come come come come hell find us
i cant imagine that i have okay
its excuse me
so i would say that it blurs the lines
between art and produce
and that it hearkens back
to the gilded age
theres a certain opulence about it
thats a very impressive analysis
hes a real pro
yeah well it reminds us that sometimes
life is just black and white
and that sometimes
an apple is just an apple and its good
is this good
no its terrible
its terrible
yes
at best it belongs
in a highend doctors office
stop youre being generous
i could see this
in a lowend dentists office

we could make that easy itd be fun
clearly youve never been
to port authority on a friday night
is there a reason
you dont want me to see your place
i mean at first it was paint fumes
and now you
hiding a dead body or something i
no no theres no thats ridiculous
the whole idea that i wouldnt want you

home sweet home
okay
um
oh you dont want to
oh my god
theyre in here too
go in the bedroom
oh papa
what is this michael
theyre smurfs
yes i i can see that
is it is it a fetish
oh god no this is not a fetish
no this is uh i guess its a hobby
or maybe its a passion
uh i started collecting these
when i was ten
it was my friend linda swzedos fault
she got me into them
she was totally obsessed with them
and then i became obsessed too
uh my mother would take me
to gift expressions
every sunday
after i helped her grocery shop
and she would buy me
a smurf figurine as a reward
my favorite was vanity smurf
who i now realize was a total closet case
like i was and then
i dont know after my mom died
i did take a tenyear smurf sabbatical
but along came ebay
and then i just kind of
all hell broke loose
i started going to toy shows
and i went to flea markets
i was buying and selling and trading
and i really cant defend this
yeah
i think that they take me back in time
you know like
to before my mom died
when
when things were easier
i think that you can imagine
why i was a little hesitant
to bring you to my apartment
say something
i
i fooled around with someone
at the gym last week
i know that you and i have never had
the exclusive conversation and
i dont know i um
i feel guilty about it
why are you telling me this
because i feel guilty about it
and thats new for me michael
you know ive never actually had
a real relationship before
a boyfriend
just a lot of casual hookups
and you know i dont usually want
more than that but
if someone gets too attached
i get out of there and this
you
it scares me
you scare me too
i think youre very cool
i think your friends are very cool
and i now know that you go to the gym
for things other than
weight lifting and treadmill
and im worried
that im going to fall in love with you
and youre going to break my heart
that scares me
i guess we scare each other
i guess we do
smurfgate almost derailed us
but by christmas we were back on track

exactly your childhood

thats what i thought you were gonna say
i have this fantasy
or its maybe its more
like a christmas wish
but that even when im older
i will lie under the tree
like this with my partner
and well just take a moment
to appreciate this beauty
and even though were old
and its getting harder to move
and lying under the tree
really hurt our backs
were still grateful
because we have each other
well thats very nice
yeah
hmm
i have an idea
an8were taking the first annual
kit and mike christmas photo
youre not so scroogey after all
weve got five seconds
you are a pro
yeah yes
smile
i am
christmas
an8just hear those sleigh bells jingling
an8ringtingtingling too
an8years go by pretty quickly
when you count by christmas trees
michael
yes
youre drinking diet coke
out of a wineglass
thats pretty chic
oh actually
this is wine in a wineglass nina
oh hes already had half a bottle
oh put a cork in it kit
is it a wine pun
that accidentally was a wine pun
yes it was
im nick by the way
uh kirby
jo
hey
hey
are you two a couple
yes
yeah
kirby used to be my roommate
cheers
thanks
well i would like
to make a toast to michael and kit
you guys are such a great couple
and youve been a huge inspiration to me
i mean 13 years
its an incredibly long time
for any couple to be together
but especially for a gay couple
mmm
right i mean in this day and age
its um a really special thing
i agree so
and even though
nick and i have only
been together for
like a couple weeks now
three weeks if you count texting
right three weeks
um i just
im really hoping that we can follow
in your wonderful example
of togetherness
okay i obviously ive not told him
oh really
yeah
whats wrong
did i miss something
yes you did
yeah
what brings you here
um
you want to say that
yeah uh
well weve been having a few
minor problems
problems yeah
for one thing our sex life
uh leaves a little to be desired
by which michael means
his clothes are deadbolted to his body
he was on grindr
during dinner with our friends
and everyone saw
no one saw
i was on it for two seconds
besides thats our agreement
looking but no touching
he is never not stoned
theres a corner of our bedroom
that has started to look like
the pot version
of walter whites meth lab
i ask him to join me but he refuses
you might actually enjoy it michael
he always asks me this
and i always tell him the same thing
thanks cherry garcia im good
its jerry garcia not cherry garcia
cherry garcia is a flavor of ice cream
is that true
when i first met him
he only drank diet coke
and now he drinks
a bottle of wine a night
it relaxes me it takes the edge off
i think ive earned that
by the time weve finished dinner
and started drag race
hes well into his second bottle
drag race is only on mondays
its a monday show
while im doing my bedtime routine
he carries on drinking and watching tv
what hes not telling you is that
his bedtime routine lasts 90 minutes
whats he doing
its my alone time
when kit and i first started dating
he didnt even own a television
and now i feel like
he watches more than i do
how would you know youre never home
he never leaves the office
which is weird
and how hard can it possibly be
to recap an episode of greys anatomy
that is a deceptively complex show
have you seen it
i i know of it
he has an insane flirtation
with tom daley
the olympic diver
his names sebastian
and hes my coworker
hey claire
hi michael
let me just wrap up
these things then we can
ill do my best
an8thomas daley great britain
85 85
they charge by the hour
im gonna go set up an invoice for them
hey
im so sorry i missed the reception
how did it go
yeah yeah it was good
stupid cabbie
took the manhattan bridge when i told him
take the tunnel
well you shouldve just taken it home
because everyones left already
im sorry
why dont you go home and unpack
and you know im just gonna stay here
you sure
yeah
ill see you at home
okay ill see you later
an8okay fine
hes tom daleys doppelgänger
if you want to be technical about it
are we not supposed to talk
to each other michael
i dont know
if thats all youre doing is talking
i dont want to talk about this
you dont want to talk about anything
he never talks about anything
you sure
you dont want to talk about it
new jersey police
recently arrested a man
for bringing a doughnut
filled with xanax pills
to a local high school student
hey youre still up
must have had a lot of cleaning up to do
yeah
then a few of us went out
for a bite to eat after
who all went
just the usual suspects
was sebastian there
yes
he was is that a problem
i dont know is it
i work with him michael
am i not allowed to go
to dinner with a coworker
you know what let me just forget it
youre just gonna walk off
thats not fair
im the one thats being blown off
and youre acting hurt
like youre the victim
how is that fair
i said forget it its fine
no its not fine
we dont need to
talk about this right now
we do need to talk about it there are
a lot of things we need to talk about
its not the first time
you havent been there
its happened a lot

with nina and sebastian
going to what art openings

over stupid side tables
yes that is exactly what i do
were just in
very different worlds right now
yeah were in
very different world right now
i agree
so you want to hear my assessment
yes absolutely
i think you guys resent each other
but you love each other too much
to part ways
i think you may need to spend time apart

currently living in separate apartments
im living here
and
i have a place in brooklyn
ive been there its small
but nice but small

im gonna be fine okay
ill come out

michael
im concerned about christopher
the growth was a lot bigger

i promise you well treat it
oh my god
wheres my camera

a quick window with candace
before they set up
for the next shot thats fine
thank you very much
let me go grab her
there she is
hey candace
were all ready for you
come on over
this way
think hes waiting for you
and you have a very limited
amount of time
thank you so much hi michael
hey candace
weve got literally five minutes
great okay
thank you
hi dylan
hi
okay
okay
hey honey im cancer
i mean im home
thats not funny kit
yeah i know
hey
hi
what are you doing
did you google it
of course i googled it
i asked you not to mike
well
the internet just tells you
youre gonna die
and youre not a doctor
so you wont understand anyway
this isnt exactly
my first runin with cancer kit
exactly i dont want this
to freak you out
and i dont want to jump to conclusions
so please hold off
i found the names of who are apparently
the best oncologists in new york
and i already made appointments with them
theyre for next week
i dont want to drag you through this
we dont even know
where we are right now
i dont care
where we are right now
im not letting you go through this alone
you dont get a choice in that matter
and you should stay here this week
all these doctors are in manhattan
perfectly healthy people
have died waiting on the l train
im scared
im scared too
generally speaking
rectal cancer is fairly common
and highly treatable
christopher i was telling
your brother when
no no no im not his brother
oh sorry
uh there are multiple nodules
adjacent to the inferior rectum
which are presumably related
to the neuroendocrine tumor
that was biopsied
well you sound optimistic
theres definitely room
for optimism here
with a neuroendocrine tumor
particularly with what i see
in the pathology report
its very amenable to therapy
so this is not one of
the more aggressive ones
correct
neuroendocrine tumors are not aggressive
so take a deep breath
it was beginning to seem like
we might dodge
a worstcase cancer diagnosis
and as if to seal the deal
our final doctor looked like
she stepped straight out
of hair and makeup
and onto the set of a tv show
a good one
i was in love with her
until she opened her mouth
you have an extremely aggressive form
of neuroendocrine cancer
your tumor is what we call highgrade
im sorry what
if you decide to get your treatment here
i would like to start as soon as possible
the other doctors that we talked to
they said that
this wasnt the aggressive kind
and theyre wrong
and his is already
at a very advanced stage
what stage are we talking
stage four
im sorry
how soon should he start treatment
ideally monday uh
he would start chemotherapy
i need a minute
this good
thank you
youre welcome
what are you gonna get
what i always get
okay
here you go you ready
yeah ill do the steak tacos
okay
can i get a diet coke please
sure
thank you
ooh
have you talked to your mom lately
no
because she keeps calling me
and im running out of excuses
of where you are
and why you cant talk to her
and i think shes getting worried
she doesnt even know
were not living together
i think maybe we should
drive down there this weekend
im not ready to tell them
i think we have to
i love this song

oh look at that
which he does
mare i do not
you do too
well i mean it is in real time
look its the little cessna ctt
very nice
hold out hold out your arm

like a like a learjet
youre knitting me a sweater
right
last week was this great
big race in toledo
which is a really nice town
id never been before
its known for glass factories
but who knows if thats actually true
listen you boys should come one year
its so much fun
they take over the whole town too
we take over the whole town
go ahead mare
anyway this woman i know
trish oneil
who won the race
shes in my agegroup but
wins races all the time
so the race starts
i saw her for the first
five miles of the bike ride
cause she and i
were riding fairly close together
and then after that
she just kind of disappears
i dont see her
the whole rest of the race
did you like the rosé michael is it
oh yes i love this
good
i love all rosé
but this is very good
last mile of the race
dadum she reappears
she cheated
you know with not one single
drop of sweat on her
she just trots across the finish line
the winner
yeah
and we were all very upset
so
you know what we have been talking
a blue streak
no
ever since you guys got here
yeah so so
wonderful
honestly whats going on with you guys
um
i dont know where to start
uh about
two or three months ago
i started experiencing a lot of pain
when going to the bathroom
and
we thought
there were a lot of things it could be
how many doctors have you seen
we saw three
it was the longest
20 minutes of my life
ill never forget how brave
you were telling them
obviously youre gonna fight it
and youll beat it
yeah
who wants cake its flourless
id love cake
here let me do it its all right
thank you
ill just okay
here
i didnt sleep
one wink last night
not one single wink
everything kept rolling around in my head
just racing around and around
i felt the same
i kept thinking about trish
oh
right
i mean its just so insulting
right
like a
like a big middle finger
to the rest of us
i mean there we are
pushing ourselves
as hard as we can
and honestly
honestly for what
for what
i dont know for what
just to see if we can
oh sure yeah that
if we can do it
i mean theres no glory in it
theres certainly no money in it
its killing my knees
but i just do it
well you should
take it easy on your knees
and then someone
like trish shows up
who hasnt got a clue she
honestly what race
does she think shes running
she thinks
she can just bypass all the hard parts
well you cant
you have to run the race in front of you
because thats all there is
marilyn do you want to
you do the best you can
but she thinks
she thinks you can cheat all of that
and im here to tell you
if you cheat youre going to get caught
im not gonna sit around
and let her get away with it
no siree bobtail
so how big is your freezer exactly
i mean is it the kind
with the drawer that pulls out

thank you for inviting us
no no it was kits idea
he wanted you here
i was vehemently opposed to it
you brat
i have a headache
we found a number of nodules on the brain
several of them located
near the brain stem
which is likely whats been
causing your headaches
how big are they
well theyre small
but there are a lot of them
and your primary tumor
has been growing again
how long
we dont like to predict these things
six weeks six months
more than six weeks
ive been feeling so much better
the radiation bought you some time
at this point all we can do
is address your symptoms
and manage your pain
im so sorry kit
there are still options here
theres this targeted treatment
its for nets
its being developed in germany
and i cant remember what its called
michael
affinator or afinator or something
michael
but i just it blocks
i think a protein signaling
pathway thats in the
it can malfunction
really germany
and leads to greater tumor growth
or something
im telling you that there are still
experimental things going on out there
there was somebody
i read about whos from italy
michael stop stop
he had a doctor
its everywhere
its in my brain

possibilities out there so
i dont know whats next for me honestly

thank you for the past 13 years
thank you for giving me a family
thank you for loving me
kit
you can go now
i was always afraid
kit would break my heart
and eventually he did
but not in the way i feared he would
he broke it open in a way that
somehow made room for even more love
both to receive and to give
and so i hope that youll understand me
when i say that this ride
with kit was to me a gift
it was the greatest honor
i believe i will ever have
to have been
by his side for it all
okay hey marilyn
i need to breathe
i need to breathe
its a car
oh god
i think he wouldve liked your eulogy
i think he wouldve thought
it was too long
well probably
what are you gonna do next
i mean besides
triathlons
ive never been to spain
and i always
i always wanted to see
that funnylooking museum
the guggenheim in bilbao
yes yes
yes thats funny
in the pictures it looks like a big ship
it does look like a ship
do you think
yeah it does
i dont know
id just like to get away for a while
that sounds really nice
new scenery to run in
oh
yeah all the running
stays the same if my knees hold on
race you to the house
okay
the hardest thing
about a story ending
is that you have to say goodbye
to your favorite characters
to your favorite people
a good tv show can make real life
seem like it makes sense
and a good ending
can feel like the end of one thing
and the beginning of another
sometimes the hero dies
sometimes we only get 14 christmas trees
when we thought wed have 40
and then an old friend reminded me
that sometimes the main character
has to take a leap of faith
that involves packing a suitcase
and traveling across the country
i dont know
maybe thats too on the nose
hi
where we going
uh jfk
where you off to
los angeles
oof
that 405 man
that thing takes no prisoners huh
i wanted our story
to be a pictureperfect
happyending love story
but what we got was a real love story
im ready
ill just shut up now
dont you
break my heart
dont you
break my heart
i put my hand in
into the bush
finding the sweetest
sweetest rose
saw a ship sailing
on the big blue sea
she sailed as deep as
deep as she could be
but not so deep in
in love as i am
i cannot whether i
i sink or swim
dont you
break my heart
oh thats why
i wanted my camera
what
i thought it looked
like the sun
dont you
these bubbles are very finicky
bye
bye
bye now
dont you
