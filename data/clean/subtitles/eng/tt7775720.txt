more advanced than that 
i mean  it started as
the literal selling of chattel

i don t give a    yeah  she knew 
oh  my god

  i mean  i had girlfriends

right up until after college 
  they have no idea

for me to accept it myself  and   
i think it will be tough for them 
and i don t think

  hold that thought 
have you seen the black apple 
well    i don t know what that means 
  come  come  come  come  he ll find us 
  i can t imagine that i have  okay 
it s    excuse me 
so  i would say that it blurs the lines
between art and produce 
and that it hearkens back
to the gilded age 
there s a certain opulence about it 
that s a very impressive analysis 
he s a real pro 
yeah  well  it reminds us that sometimes
life is just black and white
and that sometimes
an apple is just an apple and it s good 
  is this good 
  no  it s terrible 
  it s terrible 
  yes 
at best  it belongs
in a high end doctor s office 
stop  you re being generous

to port authority on a friday night

you don t want me to see your place 
i mean  at first  it was paint fumes 
and now you
hiding a dead body or something  i   
no  no  there s no    that s ridiculous

and this is the hallway  just   
eggshell white on the   
  the wall 
  that s a lovely color 
and  um  here s my door 
this is just your   
all american  typical door 
and so  um  i guess
i ll just open the door
and we can go inside 
yep  that s  that s usually
how it works  michael 
before we go in  i want to remind you
that your friends said
that they really like me 
oh  jesus  just open the door 
okay 
i mean  i m just a person like everybody 
come on  let me see your apartment 
come on 
okay 
okay  so  um   
this is where i live 
my apartment 
home sweet home 
okay 
um   
  oh  you don t want to   
  oh  my god 
  they re in here  too 
  go in the bedroom 
oh  papa 
what is this  michael 
they re smurfs 
yes  i    i can see that 
is it    is it a fetish 
oh  god  no  this is not a fetish 
no  this is  uh    i guess it s a hobby 
or    maybe it s a passion 
uh  i started collecting these
when i was ten 
it was my friend linda swzedo s fault 
she got me into them 
she was totally obsessed with them 
and then i became obsessed  too 
uh  my mother would take me
to gift expressions
every sunday
after i helped her grocery shop 
and she would buy me
a smurf figurine as a reward 
my favorite was vanity smurf 
who i now realize was a total closet case 
like i was  and then   
i don t know  after my mom died 
i did take a ten year smurf sabbatical 
but along came ebay 
and then i just kind of   
all hell broke loose 
i started going to toy shows 
and i went to flea markets 
i was buying and selling and trading   
and i really can t defend this 
yeah 
i think that they take me back in time 
you know  like   
to before my mom died 
when   
when things were easier 
i think that you can imagine
why i was a little hesitant
to bring you to my apartment 
say something 
i   
i fooled around with someone 
at the gym last week 
i know that you and i have never had
the  exclusive  conversation  and   
i don t know  i  um   
i feel guilty about it 
why are you telling me this 
because i feel guilty about it 
and that s new for me  michael 
you know  i ve never actually had
a real relationship before 
a    boyfriend 
just a lot of casual hookups 
and  you know  i don t usually want
more than that  but   
if someone gets too attached 
i get out of there  and this   
you   
it scares me 
you scare me  too 
i think you re very cool 
i think your friends are very cool 
and i now know that you go to the gym
for things other than
weight lifting and treadmill 
and i m worried
that i m going to fall in love with you
and you re going to break my heart 
that scares me 
i guess we scare each other 
i guess we do 
smurfgate almost derailed us 
but by christmas  we were back on track 
merry christmas 
how old is this thing 
1960s  so  it s not
exactly your childhood 
but you know   
it s got the wand and the cups
and the lady that you saw in half 
where did you get it 
oh  you could buy anything on ebay 
it s really special  mike 
you ll be happy to know
that i was able to resist
a super rare
christmas carol smurf that was  300

  it did

went back to millersburg that we moved in
to our first apartment together 
where should this go 
i don t know 
where should this go 
that s cold as hell 
  that s so moody 
  dusty rusty 
and it even had an outdoor space 
which  by new york standards 
made it positively palatial 
whoa 
why i didn t put myself together
as soon as you
appeared into my eyes
being just one step from being well
  cheers  to us 
  to us 
never stop believing in santa claus
he s alive  of course

  you hate it 
  i don t hate it 
  no  you hate it 
  it s very you 
  come here  get down here 
  what are we doing 
get under the tree 
is this part of decorating the tree 
  it s part of my tradition 
  okay 
every year  when i was young 
i would lay under the tree for hours
listening to my parents
moving around 
getting everything ready for the holidays 
  what 
  mike 
what 
your love of christmas is   
inspiring 
  uh  yeah  yeah  let s   
  it s inspiring 
  let s go with inspiring 
  it s inspiring  yeah 
that s what i thought you were gonna say 
i have this fantasy 
or it s    maybe it s more
like a christmas wish 
but that  even when i m older 
i will lie under the tree
like this with my partner 
and we ll just take a moment
to appreciate this beauty 
and even though we re old
and it s getting harder to move
and lying under the tree
really hurt our backs 
we re still grateful
because we have each other 
well  that s very nice 
  yeah 
  hmm 
i have an idea 
  an8 we re taking the first annual
kit and mike christmas photo 
you re not so scrooge y after all 
  we ve got five seconds 
  you are a pro 
yeah  yes 
  smile 
  i am 
christmas 
  an8 just hear those sleigh bells jingling
  an8 ring ting tingling  too   
  an8 years go by pretty quickly
when you count by christmas trees 
  michael 
  yes 
you re drinking diet coke
out of a wineglass 
  that s pretty chic 
  oh  actually 
this is wine in a wineglass  nina 
oh  he s already had half a bottle 
  oh  put a cork in it  kit 
  is it    a wine pun 
that accidentally was a wine pun 
yes  it was 
i m nick  by the way 
uh  kirby 
jo 
  hey 
  hey 
are you two a couple 
  yes 
  yeah 
kirby used to be my roommate 
cheers 
thanks 
well  i would like
to make a toast to michael and kit 
you guys are such a great couple 
and you ve been a huge inspiration to me 
i mean  13 years 
it s an incredibly long time
for any couple to be together
but especially for a gay couple 
  mmm 
  right  i mean  in this day and age 
it s  um  a really special thing 
  i agree  so   
  and  even though
nick and i have only
been together for   
like  a couple weeks now   
three weeks  if you count texting 
right  three weeks 
um  i just   
i m really hoping that we can follow
in your wonderful example
of togetherness 
okay  i    obviously  i ve not told him 
  oh  really 
  yeah 
what s wrong 
did i miss something 
  yes  you did 
  yeah 
what brings you here 
  um   
  you want to say that 
yeah  uh   
well  we ve    been having a few   
  minor problems 
  problems  yeah 
for one thing  our sex life 
uh  leaves a little to be desired 
by which michael means
his clothes are dead bolted to his body 
he was on grindr
during dinner with our friends 
  and everyone saw 
  no one saw 
i was on it for two seconds 
besides  that s our agreement 
looking  but no touching 
he is never not stoned 
there s a corner of our bedroom
that has started to look like
the pot version
of walter white s meth lab 
i ask him to join me  but he refuses 
you might actually enjoy it  michael 
he always asks me this 
and i always tell him the same thing 
 thanks  cherry garcia  i m good  
it s jerry garcia  not cherry garcia 
cherry garcia is a flavor of ice cream 
is that true 
when i first met him 
he only drank diet coke 
and now he drinks
a bottle of wine a night 
it relaxes me  it takes the edge off 
i think i ve earned that 
by the time we ve finished dinner
and started drag race 
he s well into his second bottle 
drag race is only on mondays 
it s a monday show 
while i m doing my bedtime routine 
he carries on drinking and watching tv 
what he s not telling you is that
his bedtime routine lasts 90 minutes 
  what s he doing 
  it s my alone time 
when kit and i first started dating 
he didn t even own a television 
and now i feel like
he watches more than i do 
how would you know  you re never home 
he never leaves the office 
which is weird 
and how hard can it possibly be
to recap an episode of grey s anatomy 
that is a deceptively complex show 
have you seen it 
i  i know of it 
he has an insane flirtation
with tom daley 
the olympic diver 
his name s sebastian 
and he s my coworker 
  hey  claire 
  hi  michael 
let me just wrap up
these things  then we can   
i ll do my best 
  an8 thomas daley  great britain 
  8 5  8 5   
  they charge by the hour 
i m gonna go set up an invoice for them 
hey 
i m so sorry i missed the reception 
how did it go 
  yeah  yeah  it was good 
  stupid cabbie 
took the manhattan bridge when i told him 
 take the tunnel  
well  you should ve just taken it home 
because everyone s left already 
i m sorry 
why don t you go home and unpack 
and  you know  i m just gonna stay here 
  you sure 
  yeah 
i ll see you at home 
okay  i ll see you later 
  an8 okay  fine 
he s tom daley s doppelgänger 
if you want to be technical about it 
are we not supposed to talk
to each other  michael 
i don t know
if that s all you re doing is talking 
i don t want to talk about this 
you don t want to talk about anything 
he never talks about anything 
you sure 
you don t want to talk about it 
new jersey police
recently arrested a man
for bringing a doughnut
filled with xanax pills
to a local high school student   
hey  you re still up 
must have had a lot of cleaning up to do 
yeah 
then a few of us went out
for a bite to eat after 
who all went 
just the usual suspects 
  was sebastian there 
  yes 
he was  is that a problem 
i don t know  is it 
i work with him  michael 
am i not allowed to go
to dinner with a coworker 
you know what  let me just    forget it 
you re just gonna walk off 
that s not fair 
i m the one that s being blown off 
and you re acting hurt
like you re the victim 
how is that fair 
  i said forget it  it s fine 
  no  it s not fine 
we don t need to
talk about this right now 
we do need to talk about it  there are
a lot of things we need to talk about 
it s not the first time
you haven t been there 
  it s happened a lot 
  and i apologize 
i m sorry i have deadlines 
but my readers depend upon me 
it s tv  mike 
you re not saving the world 
  it s not art 
  what do you want me to say  kit 
that i m sorry i make money 
i m sorry i have to travel
  in order to pay our mortgage 
  okay  mike 
and while i m out there
working my ass off 
you re back here
doing god knows what
with nina and sebastian 
going to  what  art openings 
jerking each other off
over stupid side tables 
yes  that is exactly what i do 
we re just in
very different worlds right now 
yeah  we re in
very different world right now 
i agree 
so  you want to hear my assessment 
yes  absolutely 
i think you guys resent each other 
but you love each other too much
to part ways 
i think you may need to spend time apart
if you really want to come back together 
we re actually
currently living in separate apartments 
  i m living here 
  and   
i have a place in brooklyn 
i ve been there  it s small 
but nice  but small 
  but nice 
  nice 
so  you re broken up 
we re taking some time
to figure some things out 
but honestly 
to your wonderful togetherness 
okay  let s eat 
  you put that down 
  yes 
  okay  now  come back  come dance 
  okay  dancing 
yes 
dig
the chills that you spill up my back
keep me filled
with satisfaction when we re done
satisfaction of what s to come
i couldn t ask for another
no  i couldn t ask for another
you know that s right
your groove i do deeply dig
no walls  only the bridge   
hey  come dance 
boring 
no  i couldn t ask for another

there are a hundred things
it could be besides cancer 
i m having it biopsied on friday 
please  don t worry about it  michael 
i m not 
i got to go 
i ve got to get on the subway 
kit  wait

christopher cowan  december 23  1972 
allergies 
hot yoga  shareable plates 
penicillin 
and what s your relationship
to the patient 
the plan is to get in there
and take a piece of it
and send it of for testing 
there s a chance that you ll go in 
you ll find out it s nothing 
  and then we ll just move on from   
  michael  relax  everything s fine 
i m gonna be fine  okay 
i ll come out
and talk to you right after i m done 
michael 
i m concerned about christopher 
the growth was a lot bigger
than i anticipated 
so it s cancer 
it s basically   
it s definitely cancer 
we won t know
until the results come back 
but whatever it is 
i promise you we ll treat it 
oh  my god

hey  candace 
we re all ready for you

and you have a very limited
amount of time 
thank you so much  hi  michael 
  hey  candace 
  we ve got literally five minutes 
  great  okay 
  thank you 
  hi  dylan 
  hi 
  okay 
  okay 
hey  honey  i m cancer 
i mean  i m home 
that s not funny  kit 
yeah  i know 
hey 
  hi 
  what are you doing 
did you google it 
of course i googled it 
  i asked you not to  mike 
  well   
the internet just tells you
you re gonna die 
and you re not a doctor 
so you won t understand anyway 
this isn t exactly
my first run in with cancer  kit 
exactly  i don t want this
to freak you out 
and i don t want to jump to conclusions 
so please  hold off 
i found the names of who are apparently
the best oncologists in new york 
and i already made appointments with them 
  they re for next week 
  i don t want to drag you through this 
we don t even know
where we are right now   
i don t care
where we are right now 
i m not letting you go through this alone 
you don t get a choice in that matter 
and you should stay here this week 
all these doctors are in manhattan 
perfectly healthy people
have died waiting on the l train 
i m scared 
i m scared  too 
generally speaking 
rectal cancer is fairly common
and highly treatable 
christopher  i was telling
your brother when   
no  no  no  i m not his brother 
oh  sorry 
uh  there are multiple nodules
adjacent to the inferior rectum
which are presumably related
to the neuroendocrine tumor
that was biopsied 
well  you sound optimistic 
there s definitely room
for optimism here 
with a neuroendocrine tumor 
particularly with what i see
in the pathology report 
it s very amenable to therapy 
so this is not one of
the more aggressive ones 
correct 
neuroendocrine tumors are not aggressive 
so  take a deep breath 
it was beginning to seem like
we might dodge
a worst case cancer diagnosis 
and as if to seal the deal 
our final doctor looked like
she stepped straight out
of hair and makeup
and onto the set of a tv show 
a good one 
i was in love with her 
until she opened her mouth 
you have an extremely aggressive form
of neuroendocrine cancer 
your tumor is what we call high grade 
i m sorry  what 
if you decide to get your treatment here 
i would like to start as soon as possible 
the other doctors that we talked to 
they said that
this wasn t the aggressive kind 
and they re wrong 
and his is already
at a very advanced stage 
what stage are we talking 
stage four 
i m sorry 
how soon should he start treatment 
ideally  monday  uh 
he would start chemotherapy 
i need a minute 
this good 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
what are you gonna get 
what i always get 
okay 
here you go  you ready 
yeah  i ll do the steak tacos 
  okay 
  can i get a diet coke  please 
  sure 
  thank you 
ooh   
have you talked to your mom lately 
  no 
  because she keeps calling me 
and i m running out of excuses
of where you are
and why you can t talk to her 
and i think she s getting worried 
she doesn t even know
we re not living together 
i think maybe we should
drive down there this weekend 
i m not ready to tell them

  look at you  my god 
  and you wear it well 
  totally cisgender 
dad  let me help you with those bags 
the last coat you got was from jcpenney 
for goodness  sakes 
like  a camera situated
right on the runway 
see  you can see there 
and then   
i mean  you can just watch planes
take off and land all day long 
  oh  look at that 
  which he does 
  mare  i do not 
  you do  too 
well  i mean  it is in real time 
look  it s    the little cessna ctt 
  very nice 
  hold out    hold out your arm 
he s not high style
like a    like a learjet 
  you re knitting me a sweater 
  right 
last week was this great 
big race in toledo 
which is a really nice town 
i d never been before 
it s known for glass factories 
but who knows if that s actually true 
listen  you boys should come one year 
it s so much fun 
  they take over the whole town  too 
  we take over the whole town 
  go ahead  mare 
  anyway  this woman i know 
trish o neil 
who won the race 
she s in my age group  but   
  wins races all the time 
  so  the race starts 
i saw her for the first
five miles of the bike ride 
 cause she and i
were riding fairly close together 
and then after that 
she just kind of disappears 
i don t see her
the whole rest of the race 
did you like the rosé  michael  is it   
  oh  yes  i love this 
  good 
i love all rosé 
but this is very good 
last mile of the race   
da dum  she reappears 
  she cheated 
  you know  with not one single
drop of sweat on her 
she just trots across the finish line 
  the winner 
  yeah 
and we were all very upset 
so   
you know what  we have been talking
  a blue streak   
  no 
ever since you guys got here 
  yeah  so    so   
  wonderful 
honestly  what s going on with you guys 
um   
i don t know where to start 
uh  about
two or three months ago 
i started experiencing a lot of pain
when going to the bathroom   
and   
we thought
there were a lot of things it could be 
how many doctors have you seen 
we saw three 
it was the longest
20 minutes of my life 
i ll never forget how brave
you were telling them 
obviously  you re gonna fight it 
and you ll beat it 
yeah 
who wants cake  it s flourless 
i d love cake 
  here  let me do it  it s all right 
  thank you 
i ll just    okay 
here 
i didn t sleep
one wink last night 
not one single wink 
everything kept rolling around in my head 
  just racing around and around 
  i felt the same 
i kept thinking about trish 
oh 
  right 
  i mean  it s just so insulting 
  right 
  like a   
like a big middle finger
to the rest of us 
i mean  there we are 
pushing ourselves
as hard as we can 
and honestly   
honestly  for what 
for what 
i don t know  for what 
just to see if we can 
  oh  sure  yeah  that 
  if we can do it 
i mean  there s no glory in it 
there s certainly no money in it 
it s killing my knees 
but i just do it 
well  you should
take it easy on your knees 
and then someone
like trish shows up 
who hasn t got a clue  she   
honestly  what race
does she think she s running 
she thinks
she can just bypass all the hard parts 
well  you can t 
you have to run the race in front of you 
because that s all there is 
  marilyn  do you want to   
  you do the best you can 
but she thinks   
she thinks you can cheat all of that 
and i m here to tell you 
if you cheat  you re going to get caught 
i m not gonna sit around
and let her get away with it 
no  siree  bobtail 
so  how big is your freezer exactly 
i mean  is it the kind
with the drawer that pulls out 
or with the skinny door on the side 
oh  we have
the drawer that pulls out 
good  good 
i m thinking i m gonna make
a whole lot of soup for the both of you 
  and i ll   
  oh 
i ll send it to you

hello 
hello  what a morning  huh 
right 
how did you ever find this place 
i ve been here before 
my family  we used to
take vacations here when i was a kid 
thank you for inviting us 
no  no  it was kit s idea 
he wanted you here 
i was vehemently opposed to it 
you brat 
i have a headache 
we found a number of nodules on the brain 
several of them located
near the brain stem 
which is likely what s been
causing your headaches 
how big are they 
well  they re small 
but there are a lot of them 
and your primary tumor
has been growing again 
  how long 
  we don t like to predict these things 
six weeks  six months 
more than six weeks 
i ve been feeling so much better 
the radiation bought you some time 
at this point  all we can do
is address your symptoms
and manage your pain 
i m so sorry  kit 
there are still options here 
there s this targeted treatment 
it s for nets 
it s being developed in germany 
and i can t remember what it s called 
  michael 
   affinator  or  afinator  or something 
  michael 
  but i just    it blocks   
i think a protein signaling
pathway that s in the   
  it can malfunction   
  really  germany 
and leads to greater tumor growth
or something 
i m telling you that there are still
experimental things going on out there 
there was somebody
i read about who s from italy 
  michael  stop  stop 
  he had a doctor   
it s everywhere 
it s in my brain 
and actually  i m relieved 
i know where i stand now 
come on 
are you   
are you afraid to die 
i m afraid
of what the end looks like  but   
am i afraid of dying 
no 
i ve had a great life  mike 
and i want you to be happy  too 
that includes meeting someone 
no  please don t do   
i really appreciate that 
but i can t talk about that right now 
okay

yes 
i m sorry i lied to you 
i m sorry  too

so much of my baggage for so many years
and making you feel like
the bad guy so many times
when you didn t deserve to 
i m sorry i never told you
how good your ass looks

and you could be
an actor on a show 
excuse me  kit  excuse me 
hey  can i help you 
yes  i m michael ausiello with tvline 
i know you re super busy

hey  kit  we need last looks 
oh  um   
i d love to stay and talk 
but it looks like i ve    i got to   
oh  gosh  if you don t mind 
i d really like to get
your feelings 
your thoughts on a couple of things 
hey  kit  they re calling for you 
please  this won t take long  i promise 
i just really need a moment with him 
  okay  okay 
  it s okay  it s fine 
  okay 
  it s fine 
  go ahead 
  first question 
your character on the show
has been very popular 
and everyone hates
to see you go  so what is next for you 
i    i don t know  um   
there are a lot of
possibilities out there  so   
i don t know what s next for me  honestly 
um    you know  it s strange 
uh   
everyone will still be here 
and i ll be    gone 
and how do you feel right now 
ooh  uh  great question 
i guess i feel like i ll   
miss this 
i ll miss this a lot 
camera s ready 
kit  we really got to go 
no  please  one more second 
just one more 
  just one question 
  shoot  go ahead 
what about me  kit 
what should i do next 
you ll know 
okay  we re back in 
okay  got it  i m coming 
so  have you got
everything you need 
you re gonna be okay 
yeah 
i m gonna be okay 
it s gonna be incredibly hard 
but i m gonna be okay 
thank you for the past 13 years 
thank you for giving me a family 
thank you for loving me 
kit 
you can go now 
i was always afraid
kit would break my heart 
and eventually  he did 
but not in the way i feared he would 
he broke it open in a way that
somehow made room for even more love 
both to receive and to give 
and so  i hope that you ll understand me
when i say that this ride
with kit was  to me  a gift 
it was the greatest honor
i believe i will ever have
to have been
by his side for it all 
okay  hey  marilyn 
i need to breathe 
i need to breathe 
it s a car 
oh  god 
i think he would ve liked your eulogy 
i think he would ve thought
it was too long 
well  probably 
what are you gonna do next 
i mean  besides   
triathlons 
i ve never been to spain 
and i always   
i always wanted to see
that funny looking museum 
  the guggenheim in bilbao 
  yes  yes 
yes  that s funny 
in the pictures  it looks like a big ship 
it does look like a ship 
  do you think 
  yeah  it does 
i don t know 
i d just like to get away for a while 
that sounds really nice 
new scenery to run in 
oh 
yeah  all the running
stays the same if my knees hold on 
  race you to the house 
  okay 
the hardest thing
about a story ending
is that you have to say goodbye
to your favorite characters 
to your favorite people 
a good tv show can make real life
seem like it makes sense 
and a good ending
can feel like the end of one thing
and the beginning of another 
sometimes the hero dies 
sometimes we only get 14 christmas trees
when we thought we d have 40 
and then an old friend reminded me
that sometimes the main character
has to take a leap of faith
that involves packing a suitcase
and traveling across the country 
i don t know 
maybe that s too on the nose 
  hi 
  where we going 
uh  jfk 
where you off to 
los angeles 
oof 
that 405  man 
that thing takes no prisoners  huh 
i wanted our story
to be a picture perfect 
happy ending love story 
but what we got was a real love story 
i m ready 
i ll just shut up now 
don t you
break my heart
don t you
break my heart
i put my hand in
into the bush
finding the sweetest
sweetest rose
saw a ship sailing
on the big blue sea
she sailed as deep as
deep as she could be
but not so deep in
in love as i am
i cannot whether i
i sink or swim
don t you
break my heart
oh  that s why
i wanted my camera 
what 
i thought it looked
like the sun 
don t you   
these bubbles are very finicky 
  bye 
  bye 
bye  now 
don t you
