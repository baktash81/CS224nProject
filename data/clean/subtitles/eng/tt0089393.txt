that way we can interview
all the cute jocks
you are gonna be so proud of me
lm gonna make such a great reporter

why arent you there
neal perlow and joseph dreyer

fourth period civics

the legs do not stop
l say we flunk her

you better be careful
you could lose your job
ltd be worth it
its not that great a job
terry
whats wrong with my article
well there isnt anything
wrong with it per se
its just
not outstanding work
well l think it is
what do you give me straight
as for my wardrobe
l give you the as because
of your hard work and you write well
but this contest
its a completely different ballgame
when l read those articles
l have to ask
does this person
have a nose for news
do they dig out
the most interesting angle
so what youre trying to tell me
is that the nutritional content
of our school lunches
isnt interesting
look terry
l know that youre disappointed
but l had to pick kids
whove got a real shot
at becoming
professional journalists
l am going to be a reporter
thats good
l like that attitude
but dont you think it would be nice
to have something to fall back on
like what
well youre a pretty girl
you could be a model
be a model
why because a pretty girl
cant possibly have a brain
look what l meant was
l know what you meant
this is a great article
and it belongs at the suntribune
and you are so clueless to life
it is really pathetic
terry its mr wonderful
always when lm busy
shes in the pool
what took you so long
l knew it was you
l keep forgetting how young you are
what a waste of a sports car
listen everythings gonna be
all right
howd this get in here
why do you always tie double knots
kevin please forget the knot
what l need is a little sympathy
l had my heart set
on that summer job
terry
l know exactly how you feel
can l tell you a little story
when l was a kid
l was obsessed with being a fireman
l used to set little fires in the back
yard and ld practice putting them out
then one day
when l was 1 2
l learned l could never be a fireman
why what happened
l found out how much money
they make pitiful
dont you understand
that l dont care what reporters make
l cant remember a time when there
was anything else l wanted to do
and its discouraging when raymaker
tells me that l should become a model
hey why not
youre a knockout
besides models make
some pretty nice bucks
you dont think l can do it either
well no thats not exactly
what l said exactly
yeah well it was close enough
you know its lucky for you
lm in love with you l think
or ld probably never
speak to you again
ld like to be alone please
now cant you be alone
when your parents are home
since you havent listened
to one word lve said
why dont you try reading my lips
goodbye kevin
would you rather spend the night
at the frat house
all men care about is sex
l resent that
big improvement huh
the room needed something
your room is why my life
is totally screwed up
you guys think beautiful women are
nothing but decoration total airheads
hey not me
these women
have my deepest respect
for showing their boobs
and for their minds
lt just so happens that kim here
reads vonnegut in her bubble bath
and luanne has dedicated
her centerfold
to help clean up toxic waste
and the only reason barbara does
her physics homework bucknaked
is because that librarys hot
come on buddy admit it
you would love to spend your entire
life just using womens bodies
yeah all but the last 60 seconds
ld like a little time to reminisce
cant you think of anything
more profound than getting laid
a blowjob
hey lm sorry
this is the perfect end to my day
l mean its as if womens lib
never existed
todays woman has the freedom to be
just as sick and perverted as us guys
oh thats wonderful
l mean l write an excellent article
and just because lm cute
no one takes me seriously
lts not fair
and yet somehow
you find the courage to go on living
you got guts
sometimes l just wish l were a guy
no you dont
the male body needs sex at all times
lts a living hell
l bet if a guy turned in the same article
it would be at the suntribune now
yeah no kidding
hey does miss april
look straight
what are the odds of this being
a homeless nymphomaniac
ls your sister home
yeah
hey terry you got company
terry
why am l brain damaged

well maybe this would help
not bad
shit maybe l should try that
okay lets see you walk
