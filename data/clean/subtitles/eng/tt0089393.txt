their king size bed is empty 
well  what do you think 
l think if you and l were
the last man and woman on earth   
   the human race would die out 
you want time to think it over 
l understand 
l have two words for you 
slumber party 
we ll invite every girl you know 
tall  short  loose  easy 
l ll be the bartender 
they can use my bedroom

 forget it 
 why 
you ll have a party  and l ll    
 oh  god

l m 1 5 years old 
ln two years  l reach the peak
of my sexual powers 
the clock is ticking 
l have to get jamming 
can t you hear
what you re saying 
 aren t you a little embarrassed 
 nope  l m horny 
horny will kick embarrassment s ass
every time 
budster  listen to me 
don t you want your first time
to be with someone you love 
l guarantee you  l ll be in love 
there s lisa macadoo 
l hear she ll do anything with anybody 
she looks pretty cheap to me 
me too 
l am so excited  you know this job
means  like  everything in life to me 
l know 
work in the sports section 
that way we can interview
all the cute jocks 
you are gonna be so proud of me 
l m gonna make such a great reporter 
 l m not there 
 why aren t you there 
neal perlow and joseph dreyer  
and then l had terry griffith 
fourth period civics 
did you see what she s wearing 
the legs do not stop 
l say we flunk her 
keep her here for another year 
you better be careful 
you could lose your job 
lt d be worth it 
it s not that great a job 
 terry 
 what s wrong with my article 
well  there isn t anything
wrong with it  per se   
   it s just   
    not outstanding work 
 well  l think it is 
what do you give me straight
a s for  my wardrobe 
l give you the a s because
of your hard work  and you write well 
but this contest 
it s a completely different ballgame 
when l read those articles 
l have to ask   
   does this person
have a nose for news 
do they dig out
the most interesting angle 
so  what you re trying to tell me
is that the nutritional content   
   of our school lunches
isn t interesting 
look  terry 
l know that you re disappointed 
but l had to pick kids
who ve got a real shot   
   at becoming
professional journalists 
l am going to be a reporter 
that s good 
l like that attitude 
but don t you think it would be nice
to have something to fall back on 
like what 
well  you re a pretty girl 
you could be a model 
be a model 
why  because a pretty girl
can t possibly have a brain 
 look  what l meant was  
 l know what you meant 
this is a great article
and it belongs at the sun tribune 
and you are so clueless to life 
it is really pathetic 
terry  it s mr  wonderful 
always when l m busy 
 she s in the pool 
 what took you so long 
 l knew it was you 
 l keep forgetting how young you are 
what a waste of a sports car 
listen  everything s gonna be
all right 
how d this get in here 
 why do you always tie double knots 
 kevin  please  forget the knot 
what l need is a little sympathy 
l had my heart set
on that summer job 
terry 
l know exactly how you feel 
can l tell you a little story 
when l was a kid 
l was obsessed with being a fireman 
l used to set little fires in the back
yard  and l d practice putting them out 
then one day   
   when l was 1 2 
l learned l could never be a fireman 
why  what happened 
l found out how much money
they make  pitiful 
don t you understand
that l don t care what reporters make 
l can t remember a time when there
was anything else l wanted to do 
and it s discouraging when raymaker
tells me that l should become a model 
hey  why not 
you re a knockout 
besides  models make
some pretty nice bucks 
you don t think l can do it either 
well  no  that s not exactly
what l said  exactly 
yeah  well  it was close enough 
you know  it s lucky for you
l m in love with you  l think   
   or l d probably never
speak to you again 
l d like to be alone  please 
now  can t you be alone
when your parents are home 
since you haven t listened
to one word l ve said   
   why don t you try reading my lips 
goodbye  kevin 
would you rather spend the night
at the frat house 
 all men care about is sex 
 l resent that 
big improvement  huh 
the room needed something 
your room is why my life
is totally screwed up 
you guys think beautiful women are
nothing but decoration  total airheads 
hey  not me 
these women
have my deepest respect 
for showing their boobs 
and for their minds 
lt just so happens that kim here
reads vonnegut in her bubble bath 
and luanne has dedicated
her centerfold   
   to help clean up toxic waste 
and the only reason barbara does
her physics homework buck naked   
   is because that library s hot 
come on  buddy  admit it   
   you would love to spend your entire
life just using women s bodies 
yeah  all but the last 60 seconds 
l d like a little time to reminisce 
can t you think of anything
more profound than getting laid 
a blowjob 
 hey  l m sorry 
 this is the perfect end to my day 
l mean  it s as if women s lib
never existed 
today s woman has the freedom to be
just as sick and perverted as us guys 
oh  that s wonderful 
l mean  l write an excellent article 
and just because l m cute   
   no one takes me seriously 
lt s not fair 
and yet  somehow
you find the courage to go on living 
you got guts 
sometimes l just wish l were a guy 
no  you don t 
the male body needs sex at all times 
lt s a living hell 
l bet if a guy turned in the same article
it would be at the sun tribune now 
yeah  no kidding 
hey  does miss april
look straight 
what are the odds of this being
a homeless nymphomaniac 
 ls your sister home 
 yeah 
hey  terry  you got company 
terry 
why am l brain damaged 
l just fooled my own brother 
hey  l wasn t paying attention 
now l am  hello  terry 
l think l can pull this off 
this morning l knew her 
l talked to her  she screamed at me   
   everything was great 
now she s wearing my clothes 
 who do you think you are  tootsie 
 no 
okay  yentl

l mean  drop your hands 
okay  now stick your hip in 
all right 
now move your feet apart 
okay

all right 
now you gotta look tougher 
very crucial 
something every guy does   
   let me see you
scratch your balls 
hey  come on  try it 
wait a minute 
watch the master 
now first  there s your basic shift 
but that s not always enough 
sometimes you ve got to get inside 
dig a little  let some air in   
   move things around 
yeah  well  maybe
my balls don t itch 
all balls itch  it s a fact 
well  maybe this would help 
not bad 
shit  maybe l should try that 
okay  let s see you walk 
hold it 
look  you got balls now  use them 
say  baby  what s happening 
l m a lean  mean sex machine 
and that be the way it is 
say  baby  what s happening 
l m a lean  mean sex machine   
   and that be the way it is 
l think you ll pass
as long as you don t move 
l m gonna do it

sturgis wilder and submit it as a guy 
lt makes perfect sense
