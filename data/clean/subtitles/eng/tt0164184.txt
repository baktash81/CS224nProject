six incoming cruise missiles 
the russians are moving west 
our berlin brigade are outnumbered

central russia 
what the hell is in alyesk 
ss 18 icbms  probable targets 
new york  washington  here 
  how good is this ceiling 
  anything but a direct hit 
satellites confirm birds in the air 
first impact estimated 25 minutes 
  is that accurate 
  it s accurate 
  i advise we go to defcon 1 
  get president zorkin on the hotline 
zorkin is missing  we have reports
of a coup in moscow 
general bulgakov
is calling the shots now 
who the hell is bulgakov 
the asshole who wanted
to use nukes in chechnya 
sir  defcon 1  we re out of time 
do it 
mr president 
it ll take a minute for the launch
to process after you give the order 
before the order can be taken 
an id check must be performed 
my id number is fifth from the top 
  sir  it s your wife on 2104 
  thank you 
  yeah 
  the order must be confirmed
  by someone on the approved list 
  shit 
gene revell 
national security advisor 
is it black tie  ok  i m on my way 
can we   
   finish this up some other time 
no 
we ve got to update these fire drills 
billy 
if the shit ever hits the fan 
i m not going underground 
it s a goddamn tomb down there 
we have to choose someone else to
face off against besides the russians 
really  let s see  who else has
27 000 nukes for us to worry about 
it s the guy with one i m worried about 
i have to send some folks to russia 
inspect their nuclear decommissioning
facility at armazas 
  arzamas 
  yeah  whatever 
  someone from your staff should go 
  i ll go 
  billy  send staff 
  i want to go 
ok 
don t underestimate zorkin  between
his economy  crime  chechnya   
  his liver 
  what s left of it  how is he 
he s scheduled a press conference
for today  so we know he can sit up 
chechnya is part of russia 
only criminals and their friends
in the west who wish it to be separate 
mr president  if you will kindly
come back   
do you guys see what i see 
  his jacket 
  he used to be able to button it up 
he s getting fat 
i know how he feels 
oh  wow  look at that 
maybe it s not the same jacket 
yeah  it has shiny sleeves  he wore it
the last time he got out of the hospital 
  he s off the diet 
  and off the wagon  he slurred   
that must be why cherlinski is there 
to keep him off the sauce 
where s cherlinski 
next to    what s her name 
the chick with the brown hair 
  elena rishkov 
  that is not cherlinski 
bzz  busted  it s cherlinski 
you re thinking cherpitski  it ain t him 
  i know  it s cherlinski 
  no  it s not  trust me 
he s next to elena rishkov  he was
banging her at the geneva summit 
cherlinski was not at geneva 
cherpitski was 
cherpitski was banging elena rishkov 
i just said zorkin s putting on weight 
why reduce it to sex  it s disgusting 
i agree  write it up 
if he is putting on weight 
that might have health consequences 
so get it in the afternoon brief 
oh  and somebody find out who is
banging elena rishkov  this is good 
what shall we make of chechnya
asking the west for protection 
she is like a beautiful virgin  escaping
the clutches of a lecherous bear 
and running to bill clinton
to save her maidenhood 
a poet once wrote   meet the new
boss  same as the old boss  
he could have been writing of us 
of europe in the 21 st century 
over 50 years of america and russia
imposing their will
on the european community 
east and west 
and we re still treated like children   
   but without the toys
or the goodnight chocolates 
each day we lose a little bit more
of our separate sovereign ability
to determine our own futures
and each day the world comes just a
little bit closer to that terrible moment
when the beating of a butterfly s wings
unleashes a hurricane   
   god himself cannot stop 
so what is it 
are you blind 
it s a bomb 
where s the fuse 
it s warm 
so am i  come on 
i don t have all night 
it s a dud 
let s get it on the truck 
but how can we sell it now 
there s always someone
who ll buy this crap 
i cannot stand all these questions
about my health 
i am to be described as
 robust  and  healthy  
is that yours or mine 
it must be yours  mine s just for show 
it s not the hospital 
  hi 
  you re still here 
well  i think to be accurate 
it s actually you who s still here 
oh  right 
not that i m complaining 
jack   
i know this is new and all  but   
   i have something i have to say
or i m going to explode 
i don t want you to be scared 
what 
you re in love with me 
jack  i m a medical professional 
i can read the symptoms 
you re definitely in love with me 
and that scares you 
not even a little 
but i think it scares you 
no  not even a little 
and for the record 
you re the one who brought it up 
forget it 
  i m gonna get it 
  no way  it ll stop 
i don t know who this is 
  just go about your business 
  the timing sucks 
do what you have to do  i understand 
yes  this is dr muller 
muller  you paged me 
hello 
stop  yes  this is jack ryan 
jesus 
ok  i ll be there in half an hour 
i gotta go  i have an emergency
at work 
i have to go  i m sorry 
cathy  how about dinner tonight 
yeah 
  how about tomorrow night 
  jack  i said yes to tonight 
i know 
what kind of emergency
does a historian have 
he died at 0420 zulu  8Â½ hours
later  they swore in a new president 
  who is he 
  alexander nemerov 
you re kidding  i wrote a paper
about him a year ago 
  i said he could be the next guy 
  i know 
  nobody read it 
  they re reading it now 
  who 
  cabot 
i ve been here 14 months 
he doesn t know what i look   
  are you ryan 
  yes  sir 
what is this   the paper chase  
  sir  my   
  come on  we re late 
you re about to breathe air that s way
over your pay grade  so listen 
you ll be asked for advice  be sure
you know what you re talking about 
don t be afraid to say you don t know 
choose your words carefully 
they could become policy 
hey  you  give me your coat 
come on  you ll get it back 
tie 
so  intelligence committee 
i ve watched these on c span 
never actually been to one 
you ve never watched
one of these on c span 
our most important assessment comes
from a source inside the kremlin 
in his opinion  nemerov does not owe
his ascension to the military 
everyone has opinions  mr cabot 
i respect that 
this morning  my wife woke up
and said i was old  bald and ugly 
is that a question  mr chairman 
i told her
appearances aren t everything 
  would you agree 
  i certainly would 
now  this new fellow  nezmeroz 
is that his name 
nemerov  sir 
despite what your source says 
we hear that nezmeroz is a hardliner 
is he a hardliner 
no 
it s too soon to make that assessment 
according to cnn 
your mr nezmeroz is making promises
to rebuild the russian empire 
that sounds pretty rash
from where i sit 
if i were sitting in chechnya 
i d be even more worried 
sir  nemerov only said that
to get the hardliners off his back 
if we leave him alone 
russia will stabilise 
when i asked for your advice  i didn t
mean that you should actually speak 
mr cabot 
some of our assets in the russian
government who know mr nemerov
have not had a chance to report in 
i d like to take a couple of days
and gather more information for you
before characterising him 
but i do maintain my opinion
that appearances can be deceiving 
you re saying i m wrong 
absolutely  mr chairman 
i don t think you re ugly 
  i was out of line  i apologise 
  senators don t like to be surprised 
i hint at what i m gonna tell them  then
i give them a while to get used to it 
then i tell them 
  i understand 
  good 
but i m right about nemerov 
your girlfriend like
this stubborn streak in you 
what 
cathy muller 
second year surgical resident 
baltimore memorial hospital 
welcome to the cia  sport 
your intelligence is a little flawed 
i wouldn t call her my girlfriend    yet 
  what exactly would you call her 
  great  amazing 
she s just afraid to commit 
he s terrified of commitment 
a man who s afraid of commitment
after three dates  alert the media 
  i know  i know 
  so what does he do 
he was in the marines
before he hurt his back 
  now he s a historian 
  yawn 
no  he works for a think tank
across the river 
double yawn 
all right  rita  let s see what you have
to say after we meet him tonight 
he s   
   cute 
  i have fat fingers 
  cathy  cute scale  one to ten 
oh  god  i don t know 
twelve 
ask them where they found this 
in the field  in the golan 
there was a lot of fighting there
in 1973  did they witness it 
this one says he lost his son 
does he remember 
was there a plane shot down 
yes  an israeli jet  destroyed 
this is worthless 
but tell him i will give him  400   
because of his son 
thank    thank you 
thank you 
how did you come by it 
i found her in the attic of an old
mansion house in glasgow 
your little trip to the attic has got you
a piece worth now about   1 000 
even in this condition  and had she
been in better condition  even more 
a jolly nice find 
in fact  what i thought i d found
was a garden ornament 
hello  cathy 
hi  i m glad you called  i m running late 
can you come a half an hour later 
i can t make it  i m really sorry 
  it s a last minute work thing 
  what s that noise 
i m calling from a plane 
  this just came up  i tried to call you 
  where are you going 
  i can t tell you that 
  jack 
you can t tell me 
jack 
  hold on  yes  sir 
  what are you doing 
i had a date tonight  so i had to cancel 
don t be stupid  tell her where you re
going  tell her who you work for 
she ll be impressed 
ok  i work for the cia 
the director asked me to go with him to
russia to do a nuclear arms inspection 
  hello 
  that is so lame 
i swear  we get to inspect to make sure
they re decommissioning their arsenal 
hello 
hello 
thanks  thanks a lot 
zdravstvuyte  william cabot 
president nemerov 
pleasure  sir 
may i present mrs lathrop 
mr president 
  general rand 
  mr president 
  dr ryan 
  mr president 
you must be the dr ryan who s done
such interesting research on me 
you should not be surprised 
we know quite a bit 
we know how wrong your report was
that i had many girlfriends in college 
i met my wife in my third year and have
not looked at another woman since 
i was referring to
the first two years    sir 
where you received
highest honors in english 
i like him 
well  in that case  so do i 
i apologise for interjecting myself
in your inspection tour 
but i have a message
for president fowler 
you could just call him on the phone 
i would like him to hear it from you 
his friend of many years 
who received it personally from me 
and saw my expression and the
language of my body as i spoke it 
i understand 
chechnya is an internal affair 
what we do there should be
none of your concern 
i will relay the message 
but i don t think he will agree 
some people in my country
will use this issue to weaken me 
some people in my country say
your war in chechnya
is exactly your weakness 
chechnya is a nation of criminals 
every day brings another cowardly
attack on innocent russian citizens 
it is none of your concern 
stability is our concern 
peace in chechnya is our concern 
and  if i may speak frankly   
   your control over your military
concerns us too 
for you to get involved here  it s    like
sleeping with another man s wife 
and what you are suggesting
is that afterward
they can all live together
under the same roof 
but what really happens is
the betrayed husband buys a gun 
  that went well 
  who s the guy with nemerov 
  anatoli grushkov 
  old kgb 
he s been around since brezhnev 
nobody s had the guts to get rid of him 
because he knows
where the bodies are buried 
he probably buried them himself 
and we were able to obtain a roster
of their scientists at arzamas 
who s who  what their expertise is 
arzamas 16 is home
to the all russian scientific research
institute of experimental physics
and is the birthplace
of our first atomic bomb 
many of our greatest scientists
worked here and many still do 
since 1995 
we have dismantled
over 10 000 nuclear devices 
we tried so hard to get in here
over the years 
i sent three people 
they all died trying 
what does the t shirt say 
 i am a bomb technician  if you
see me running    try to catch up  
ok 
sir  i m sorry  just one quick thing 
i m sure it s nothing 
according to this  there are
17 senior scientists on duty today 
i only count 14 
doctors milinov  orlov and spassky 
they don t seem to be here 
i will make inquiries 
dr milinov is out sick 
orlov is on vacation 
spassky  i m grieved to say 
was killed
driving his car to work
just this past week 
we move on  shall we 
please 
very impressive  you almost seem
to have that information memorised 
i assumed you would ask  dr ryan 
we touch down at andrews at 2130 
tell him to meet me there 
sir  those three missing scientists 
milinov s expertise is detonators 
spassky s expertise
is the nuclear core 
orlov is a mathematician
whose expertise is the geometry of
high explosives inside a fission bomb 
the exact three men you would need
if you wanted to build a bomb 
  grushkov said   
  grushkov s a liar 
milinov is not sick 
orlov hardly ever takes a vacation
and spassky  who s supposed to have
died driving a car  doesn t drive 
they have no idea
where these guys are 
i m dying to ask you how you know 
secure source inside the kremlin 
codename spinnaker 
he gives me stuff  i give him stuff 
we keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster 
and speaking of disaster 
did you call your girlfriend yet 
no  i don t know how to get out of this 
all right  invite her to the white house
correspondents dinner sunday night 
it s the hottest ticket in town 
  sounds great  how do i get in 
  trust me 
i ll see you at the car 
still loving your desk job 
yeah  i am 
how s your russian 
still works  why 
three russian nuclear scientists are
missing  i need to know where they are 
i wasn t doing this any more 
i just need information this time 
johnny 
your orders are on the plane 
wheels up at 2330  have a nice flight 
sunday night  8 00  at the hilton  the
tickets are in the name of john clark 
  you do have a tux 
  yeah  yes  sir 
my beautiful wife  julie  is from
new jersey  15 electoral votes 
and is  as you know  half jewish 
so we ll take florida s
25 electoral votes and divide by two 
  this is a nice hotel 
  yeah  beautiful 
my friend rita stayed here once 
she said it was    nice 
maybe after dinner we can   
   we can get a room here 
i already did 
  you didn t 
  yes  i did 
   i did  on a handful of occasions 
smoke marijuana 
california  54 electoral votes 
at 0600 moscow time  the russians
launched a massive artillery strike
against grozny 
the capital of chechnya 
the shells contained an experimental
chemical weapon  a nerve agent 
saturation  you can see
on the sat photos  took 20 minutes 
after which every person
inside a radius of 12 miles
was rendered helpless by symptoms
approximating late stage cerebral palsy 
  oh  my god 
  how many dead 
nemerov launched the biggest attack
in the history of chemical warfare 
  let s talk response 
  the worst thing we can do is nothing 
if he gets away with chemical weapons 
what s next  biological  nuclear 
ok  short of gassing the kremlin 
what s the strongest response 
  we send in peacekeepers 
  chechnya s not sovereign 
they requested recognition  so we
give it  not full diplomatic  provisional 
then the chechens request assistance
and we send in peacekeepers 
  how do you get them in there 
  we fly them in from turkey 
  over armenian air space 
  to screw russia  they won t complain 
let s do it  nemerov can choke on it 
bill 
  dr ryan 
  yes  sir 
what do you think 
conventional wisdom suggests
that nemerov is playing
the traditional russian role 
be aggressive  flex your muscles 
dare the world to stop you 
  but nemerov isn t conventional 
  he acts like a hardliner 
with respect  i don t think he is one 
he just gassed the capital of another
country  with respect  you re wrong 
  so what are we wasting our time for 
  what if he didn t order the attack 
what if nemerov
didn t order the attack 
what if it was a    a rogue general 
or a military unit frustrated they
couldn t get the rebels out of the city 
have you reason to believe he didn t
order it  or are you just floating this 
you don t know 
i don t think he did it  sir 
i would bet he didn t do it 
will senior staff remain behind
for a few minutes  please 
russia s newly installed president 
alexander nemerov 
has just begun to address the state 
we join him in progress 
for ten years now 
we have contended   
excuse me  could you turn that up 
    toward innocent russian citizens 
finally   
    every nation has a right
to defend itself 
this terrorism must end 
the bombing of chechnya   
was my decision 
nice going  ace 
who did it 
general pildysh  general mitkin 
unhappy old communists 
bastards 
  relieve them of command 
  i will shoot them myself 
just disappear them 
their execution would tell the world
i didn t have control 
these days  better to appear guilty
than impotent 
how is our russian friend
affected by this 
i am not affected 
i remain devoted to our little plan 
at what you re charging us 
i am not surprised 
  and the american 
  mr mason is a believer 
i put a little extra
in the escrow account for him 
  why 
  he won t live long enough to get it 
  where is the package 
  it left haifa a week ago 
i m told these things can kill you 
but so much has changed 
perhaps the new situation suggests
we consider    a different approach 
maybe try to bring russia
more into europe 
more into our way of thinking 
we have discussed that 
monsieur monceau 
and with your concurrence  rejected it 
oh  perhaps we were hasty 
  perhaps our plan is   
  is what 
not perfectly conceived 
are you crazy  all over
the world  right wing parties 
nationalist movements 
nazis  aryan nations 
all working together for the first time 
is that not perfect 
well  i respect the will and judgment
of my friends 
but in light of the week s events 
i am grown   
   uncomfortable with this plan 
so i must    beg your leave 
gentlemen 
herr haft will help you out 
your scarf  monsieur 
watch it with that thing 
you re gonna kill somebody 
yo  what s up  mason 
you know  i always wanted to ask
you    where d you get that tat  man 
the navy 
the navy  i was in the navy 
hospital ship  six years  you 
eight months 
oh  you wash out 
all right  brother 
you have a good one 
yeah  brother 
    not realising the rest of the world is
watching and will take a cue from us   
the unprecedented attack
on chechnya
signals a dangerous
and troubling shift in russian policy 
it demands the toughest and most
unambiguous response from the west 
nato forces are on their way to
chechnya to serve as peacekeepers
and to provide humanitarian aid
to victims of this monstrous   
i expected this 
really 
what will you do 
nothing 
we will do nothing 
these are four hours old  russian
12th  15th and 2nd tank regiments 
why haven t they moved 
  nemerov s too smart to move them 
  he speaks 
jack  nemerov s got  like  19 000
tanks  no way nato can match that 
that s why he s not gonna move them 
it s like chess 
he s thinking three moves ahead 
the nato playbook says we can only
stop him with tactical nuclear weapons 
and he won t risk a nuclear war
over this 
i also think he s sending us
a message  he didn t bomb grozny 
excuse me 
i m looking for mrs spassky 
at the end of the corridor 
i haven t seen sasha since university 
and you were his teaching assistant 
strange  i don t remember you 
when he heard i was in arzamas 
he asked me to look in on you 
  he says he ll take me to the west 
  that would require a lot of money 
just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesn t mean others won t 
he has a secret job 
for the government 
for imbeciles with money 
same nonsense  do this  don t do that 
they even told him
not to call his mother 
the pigs 
i could die any day
and he can t phone his mother 
but my sasha  he called 
just last night 
clark got us her number  nsa traced
calls to that number back to here 
it s an abandoned soviet army base
on the kremenchug reservoir 
what are three russian atomic
scientists doing in ukraine 
a fair guess  they re building a bomb 
nemerov has thousands of bombs 
why would he build a secret one 
deniability 
build one nobody knows about  he can
drive it to chechnya in his beemer 
no way to track it  no way to trace it 
he could set it off and say 
 i didn t do it  
with respect  i don t think
that adds up 
it adds up  you just don t like
what it adds up to 
ah  the warmth of plutonium decay 
it s completely corroded 
at least you re wearing gloves 
anyone want to light up
an american cigarette 
you re crazy 
i m going out 
the explosive blocks
must be replaced 
machined to a thousandth
of a millimetre
in a mathematically determined
configuration 
  do we have a bomb 
  first we must analyse the yield   
do we have a bomb 
yes 
yes  we do 
this is a    a test 
answer it 
  answer it 
  are you sure 
hello 
yes 
yes  sir 
i have to go outside for just a second 
ok  i ll be right back 
i ll be right back 
  sir  i write reports 
  i reviewed your military records 
  you can take care of yourself 
  yes  sir  but i m not trained for that 
i m not asking you to be an operations
officer  just my eyes and ears  i can t go 
so    this isn t sanctioned 
i want you to give this to clark 
see what he finds out  bring it home 
yes  sir 
jack   
   we never had this discussion 
what discussion 
ok  clark    so this is
three days ago 
it shows vehicles here 
guards here and here 
i gotta get one of those 
now  the infrared satellite
took this photograph 34 hours ago 
that shows guards here and here 
i don t even have e mail 
there are two at the checkpoint 
between two and five in the barracks
and two with the package 
which we believe to be here 
no problem  give me a couple
of guys  some tranquilliser darts 
we can be out in six minutes 
  there is a problem 
  what s that 
this is yesterday 
no guards visible at all 
why is that a problem  mr ryan 
for two reasons  either we can t
see them  which is bad 
or worse  they left  and we re too late 
suit up 
  what 
  you can t go dressed like that 
no  no  i m an analyst 
i don t go on missions 
relax  007  it s not a mission 
it s just a recce 
ok  fine  whatever you call it 
i don t do that  i just write reports 
ok  so write a report about it  suit up 
clark  no 
clark    no 
so  cabot tells me you got my ticket
to the correspondents dinner 
have a good time 
i ve never been to one of those 
i was actually looking forward to it 
clark  no  i m not going in there 
goddamn right  you re gonna stay here
and make sure no one steals my boat 
be right back 
damn 
oh  jesus 
oh  god  immigration didn t
call you guys  huh 
i m sorry  you speak english 
i don t speak much ukrainian 
it s not what you think  i m an
american citizen  i have my papers   
ok  no papers 
please  just put the gun down 
the light  you want
me to put the light down 
ok  take it easy 
i ll put the light down 
here we go  i m putting it down 
shoot him  ryan 
shoot him 
shoot him before he figures out
what i m saying 
  get their shoes 
  what 
tell them to take their shoes off 
  you speak ukrainian 
  yeah  you don t 
whatever it is they were spray painting
was big  about the size of a fridge 
the imprint it left was deep 
so we know three things 
it was heavy  something was
radioactive  and now it s gone 
  one of them spoke english 
  south african 
so  what s a south african
doing in the ukraine
with three russian scientists
and a crate from israel 
  tell cabot i ll call him from haifa 
  i have a feeling you better hurry 
most people believe the 20th century
was defined by the death struggle
of communism versus capitalism
and that fascism was but a hiccup 
today we know better 
communism was a fool s errand  the
followers of marx  gone from this earth 
but the followers of hitler
abound and thrive 
hitler  however 
had one great disadvantage 
he lived in a time when fascism 
like a virus 
like the aids virus 
needed a strong host in order to spread 
germany was that host 
but strong as it was 
germany could not prevail 
the world was too big 
fortunately  the world has changed 
global communications 
cable tv  the internet 
today the world is smaller
and the virus does not need
a strong host in order to spread 
this virus   
   is airborne 
one more thing 
let no man call us crazy 
they called hitler crazy  but hitler
wasn t crazy  he was stupid 
you don t fight russia and america 
you get russia and america
to fight each other
and destroy each other 
  what did you find

we have no word as to what but
there is an enormous cloud over

mr president   
there s been a nuclear explosion in
america  you must come with us now 
what 
we don t know who or how 
but it wasn t us 
after grozny you hope it wasn t us 
we are drafting
a strong denial for you 
and a statement of sympathy 
and yuri    order all military
on the alert 
hey  it s ryan 
  jack  where are you 
  somewhere outside baltimore 
  cabot got the president out 
  where is he now 
they re taking him airborne  on naoc 
they think it might be the russians 
it wasn t the russians  i gotta talk to
cabot  patch me through to the plane 
cabot s not on the plane  we don t
know where he is  call back in an hour 
we don t have an hour 
fowler s gonna want to hit back now 
listen  we have to prove it wasn t the
russians before he s convinced it is 
can you get back to langley 
there s no time  the radiation
assessment team  where are they 
stambler tunnels  south of the city 
the prevailing winds are blowing
the fallout to the east and north 
as long as you stay south you re ok 
  mr president  are you all right 
  how the hell do you think i am 
  how many casualties 
  we don t know 
  how the hell did it get there 
  we don t know  radar didn t pick it up 
  well  how is cabot  where is he 
  i don t know 
  what do you know 
  i don t know  all right  i don t know 
i don t know 
  general  kondor is not on board 
  send the afrat team 
mr president  i recommend
we move to defcon 2 
where s our intelligence 
russian air defences
are at their highest level 
maybe they re afraid of being attacked 
i can t get this goddamn chair open 
we re about to take off 
  we don t know who did it   
  we think the russians   
  you think 
  sir  defcon 2 
  we re groping in the dark   
  this is too much goddamn bullshit 
and not enough fact 
the blast crater is about
100  150 yards wide 
which suggests a low yield device 
quite a bit smaller
than the hiroshima bomb 
a quarter of a square mile
around the stadium is just gone 
beyond that  buildings remain  heavily
damaged  for another quarter mile 
the damage tapers off the farther
you get from ground zero 
dubinin 
herr haft has left for america 
now we are counting on you 
i assure you 
i will earn every pfennig 
attention 
you ve heard of the bomb in the usa 
what you haven t heard
is that 15 minutes ago
an american icbm hit moscow 
we are to retaliate against an american
aircraft carrier in the north sea 
man your aircraft 
the ash isn t radioactive  the winds
are blowing the fallout to sea 
captain  jack ryan  cia 
lorna shiro  you need to wait outside 
i need to know all you know
about the bomb 
we re collecting samples  get in line
and we ll have the report out tomorrow 
captain  i need to know now
where this bomb came from 
or even where it didn t come from
or there may not be a tomorrow 
shit  wesson  where are you 
about a quarter mile from ground zero 
this is about as far as we ll go 
my feet are sizzling 
i m getting rads
nearly the limit of our gear 
  ok  cut the rover loose and get out 
  roger that 
dillon  the crate the bomb was shipped
in  somebody had to sign for it at port 
customs must have a database 
get me a name  where s cabot 
no one knows 
we re checking the hospitals 
  have you tried memorial 
  he wouldn t be there 
no  i mean    is it still   
it s cathy s hospital 
as far as i know it s still there 
but the phones are down 
all right  can you keep checking 
thanks 
they could have launched
a cruise missile 
  we don t know that this is russia 
  we don t know it s not 
if they were sending us a message 
they d want us to know it was them 
except they could inspire
the confusion we re going through now 
mr president  we re uplinked 
president nemerov  there s been a
major nuclear event in the united states 
loss of life is severe 
  it was no accident 
  it was not an accident 
we don t yet know where
it came from  we don t   
we have not yet ascertained the
source of this weapon  rest assured   
we have not yet ascertained
the source of this weapon 
but rest assured those responsible
will be dealt with most severely 
he s fishing 
send our reply 
whoa  that was a little fast 
 please accept the deepest
sympathies of the russian people  
 if it was deliberate 
this is a crime without precedent  
 what madman would do such a thing
and for what purpose  
 you must believe that russia had
nothing to do with this infamous act  
it s canned 
he prepared that in advance 
president nemerov  we ve no reason
to suspect russian involvement   
   at this time   
   but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression 
he thinks we did this 
we must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons 
they have to understand that
attacking russia would be suicide 
increase the alert status 
tao  ew  i m picking up
intermittent radar  bearing 020 
where 
now it s gone 
there  it s a weak signal 
tao  inbound contact 
multiples on the same bearing 
  vampire  vampire 
  fast movers inbound 
i got seven  eight  nine of them 
the missiles definitely came
from russian aircraft 
grennel thinks he can save the ship 
but flight ops are out 
i ordered no such attack 
you must not respond to this action   
    until we investigate all possibilities  
like you did in chechnya 
mr president  who is in control
of your armed forces 
you dropped the bomb on hiroshima 
you dropped the bomb on nagasaki 
do not lecture me on chechnya 
    lecture me on chechnya  
mr president  we are now at a
de facto state of war with the russians 
john clark was in haifa yesterday 
we have to find him right away 
wow 
look at that gadolinium reading 
yeah  the mass fraction is huge 
ok  connect me to dillon  i ll hold 
there it is  savannah river 
  oh  yeah 
  oh  yeah  what 
they had a gadolinium problem 
hanford does it another way 
and generate too much promethium 
hold on  can you translate that
into english 
this plutonium came from the doe
plant at savannah river  february  68 
from k reactor  we even know
which part of k reactor 
  wait  this is our plutonium 
  made in the usa 
dillon  you ve got to find cabot 
are you advocating we launch
a first strike 
it is not a first strike  there s already
been a first strike  and a second 
  don t you get it 
  no  i don t get it 
i don t understand why we have
to nuke them  it s not reasonable 
sidney  goddamn it 
they practically sank
an aircraft carrier 
their missile silos are hot 
we re getting bullshit from nemerov 
let s not forget how this started 
they tried to kill me  remember 
don t fucking tell me to be reasonable 
please come to the triage tent
on the side of the building 
we will help you find
who you are looking for 
but we are low on blood supply 
sir 
sir 
hi 
what 
  president 
  the president s fine 
he s fine  sir   
the bomb  the plutonium   
  wife 
  what 
wife 
your wife  i m sure she s fine 
she s in dc 
the blast radius wasn t that   
   it wasn t that wide 
sir  listen to me 
the plutonium was ours 
john clark s in haifa to track down
the arms dealer  i can t get hold of him 
i don t know what to do 
girl    girlfriend 
she   
she works in baltimore  so   
   i don t know 
spinnaker 
  what 
  spinnaker 
sir 
bill 
yeah  we found the receiver address
for the crate 
port of baltimore 
can you get to the docks 
find the transcon warehouse 
the name on the manifest is mason 
sorry  i need this truck 
come on 
shit 
sir  we ve come up
with another alternative 
a conventional attack on the airbase
where the carrier attack originated 
  it s a measured response 
  non nuclear 
  is it strong enough 
  smart bombs and f 16s 
can t afford for them to see us as weak 
they ve got to know we have the guts
to take it to the next level 
i think they ll get that message 
hit  em 
eagles nest  this is eagle one 
we have target acquired  target is lit 
to make no response
is to invite a greater attack 
american submarines from norfolk
and kings bay are putting to sea 
they carry trident d3 missiles 
a first strike weapon 
fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike 
perhaps he doesn t think
it s the first strike 
once their stealth bombers go up 
we will have no choice 
that will be the sign 
how do we convince him
not to launch his bombers 
  maybe we should   
  bring our missiles to highest alert 
they d be crazy to attack then 
can i have your attention 
the generator has gone out 
there s broken glass everywhere  stay
where you are  we will get back to   
ok  fine  please  stay where you are 
we ll get you one by one 
sir  can you hear me 
can you feel your arms and legs 
what have you got 
what do we do with the ones
we know won t make it 
whatever we can 
what 
bill cabot died 
i m really sorry 
this can t be happening 
sir  we have a call from langley 
thank you 
  becker 
  this is jack ryan 
great  the nemerov apologist 
sir  this bomb was not nemerov 
i know this guy 
you said that after grozny 
put it in your report 
the plutonium   
seems unusual to find
radiation poisoning here 
i have never seen such a thing 
that is why we published the case
on the internet  to seek help 
  how did he say it happened 
  he will not talk about it 
was anyone else exposed
to the materials that made you sick 
mr ghazi  i m not the police 
i m a physician  i assure you
anything you say stays between us 
my friend and i find bomb 
we sell to a man
who buys such things 
was it this man 
other people may have come
in contact with that bomb 
we must help them 
i am    going to die 
yes 
yes 
his name is olson 
he live in damascus 
oh  yeah  we re getting it all 
a nuclear strike on colorado springs
would take out norad 
it would limit their ability
to launch a counter attack 
how many people live
in colorado springs 
three or four hundred thousand 
mr president  to use nuclear weapons
against the americans   
   would be to cross a threshold 
they think we already have  should
we now wait for them to annihilate us 
i cannot stop what i did not start 
mr president  we need you
to initiate snapcount 
what happens then 
we prepare to take out their land based
missiles with a nuclear strike 
find and kill their subs  knock out
the planes they have on the ground
and mobilise our fighters to destroy
the ones they already have in the air 
what are our chances 
david 
odds are we leave nemerov
in a pretty pickle 
he ll be left with  at best 
a few hundred nukes 
the ones we can t find 
mostly the    smaller  more mobile 
less accurate kind 
all those can do is target our cities 
but he knows to an absolute certainty
that we will respond against his cities 
i spent my entire adult life
wanting to be president 
this is my presidency 
sir  i think he ll keep his 300 nukes as a
deterrent against any future aggressor 
i think he ll push back from the table
and call it a night 
i m giving the order for snapcount 
maximum readiness 
olson had wire payments of  45 million
from someone named dressler 
dillon  find out who dressler is 
jack  i want you out of there 
  i m at the docks 
  look for the name dressler 
no  jack  get out  dillon  call the
baltimore pd  give them the address 
  wait for the cops 
  i ll call you back 
who s dressler 
where is he  goddamn it 
where is dressler 
police  put your hands up 
  where s dressler 
  are you jack ryan 
  where s dressler  goddamn it 
  let him go 
where s dressler  where is he 
langley said you might need help 
  i gotta get to the pentagon 
  i think i can help you with that 
mr president 
their stealth bombers
have left aviano 
that is the sign 
shoot them down 
god protect us 
mr president  they re scrambling
their fighters  we re out of time 
  dave 
  he has a heart condition 
  get a doctor 
  mr president 
  where s your nitro 
  i said get a doctor 
  mr president 
  take him to my quarters 
colonel  bring in the launch codes 
dressler s an austrian manufacturer 
billionaire 
his father was executed at nuremberg 
he bought a seat in parliament and got
booted out for saying pro nazi things 
rudy  get me through to the president 
i can t do it  jack 
they re in the snapcount 
  there s no way in 
  bullshit 
  i can do that for you  sir 
  no  it s fine  got some dirt on it 
  can i see it  we re on high alert 
  i understand 
  sir  put the card down 
  back off 
  i am ordering you   
  back off 
step back now  i am ordering
you to take a step back  put   
general  there s a dr ryan
from the cia 
he wants to enter nmcc 
he s unescorted 
  what s he want 
  you  sir 
i have a message from director cabot
that i need to transmit over the hotline 
  what s your authorisation 
  i don t have one 
  where s cabot 
  cabot s dead  sir 
  i need to get this information sent 
  not without authorisation  get him out 
wait  general  the president is basing
his decisions on bad information 
if you shut me out 
your family and my family
and 25 million other families
will be dead in 30 minutes 
my orders are to get this information
to the people who make the decisions 
i just need to send some information 
what makes you think
the president will listen to you 
he doesn t have to 
how close are the bombers 
they re slipping in and out of radar
over poland 
activate the missile regiments 
the launch sequence takes a minute
to process after you give the order 
before the order can be taken 
an id check must be performed 
mine is the    my number is   
   the third one    third number down
from the top 
your orders  sir 
  strike 
  i m sorry  sir 
i give the order to strike 
under the two man rule  the order
to strike must now be confirmed 
bob  for the love of god 
just do it 
sidney owens  secretary of state 
it s the fourth number down 
the order to strike has now been
confirmed by the two man rule 
nmcc  strike order has been
confirmed  start the sequence 
  we ve got activity on the hotline 
  they ve had their chance 
no  somebody s talking to the kremlin 
it says   america has been the victim
of a terrorist attack  
as you can imagine  there has
been much confusion here   
   and fear 
but we know the weapon
was not russian 
 but we know the weapon
was not russian  
what the hell is going on 
type exactly what i say 
who are we talking to 
ryan  i met you in moscow with
bill cabot  he died today in baltimore 
  cut him off 
  launch sequence has begun 
two months ago 
a neo fascist named dressler bought
an a bomb on the black market 
  cut him off 
  the system can t be cut off 
then get someone to stop him 
  he paid three disaffected russian   
   scientists to make the bomb active  
 he shipped it to the us 
where a man named mason 
was hired to deliver the bomb and
set our countries on a collision course 
this is madness  he is cia 
we cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy 
what is the harm of listening
a bit more 
what are you asking of me 
back down 
what guarantee do i have that
president fowler will follow suit 
none 
you see  he is wasting time 
we must launch now 
we have only moments 
sir  i know you had nothing to do
with the baltimore bomb
and you know you didn t  but you re
still about to launch a nuclear strike 
  yes  sir  that s all  dr ryan 
  this is about fear 
fear of your missiles 
fear of our subs 
fear of being weak 
of making a mistake 
the fear of the other guy that had us
build these bombs in the first place 
it stopped 
they cut him off 
they are going to strike 
prepare the launch orders now 
30 seconds to launch 
oh  my god  mr president 
we will maintain our defensive alert
for the moment 
but our offensive forces
are withdrawn 
 if you match this  i propose a phased
mutual stand down over five hours  
stop the launch sequence 
lasseter here  flash override 
stop the sequence 
order the planes to stand down 
take us to defcon 3 
and would somebody ask mr ryan
if i can use the phone now 
you re still here 
there is no more fitting memorial
for those who perished in this tragedy
than the steps we ve taken this week
toward a multinational campaign
to root out and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction 
we embarked on this course because
we have learned  at too great a cost 
that if the most powerful weapons
ever created are unleashed 
they will be fired not in anger 
but in fear 
dr ryan 
mr grushkov 
it is    a lovely day 
yeah 
  i m sorry  this is   
  dr muller  how do you do 
nice to meet you 
why am i not surprised
you know her name 
our friend william thought
i was a spy 
of course  he could never prove it 
he never told me you were friends 
maybe he didn t know you well enough 
he told me he had a source in russia 
 to keep the back channels open  
 in hopes of staving off disaster  
kennedy said 
 our most basic common link 
 is that we all inhabit
this small planet   
 we all breathe the same air  
 we all cherish our children s future    
    and we re all mortal  
i will miss    so very much
talking to william 
me too 
perhaps from time to time
you and i can talk 
yeah  i d like that 
what is this
