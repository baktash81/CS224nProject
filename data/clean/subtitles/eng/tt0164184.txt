who the hell is bulgakov
the asshole who wanted
to use nukes in chechnya

to process after you give the order
before the order can be taken
an id check must be performed
my id number is fifth from the top
sir its your wife on 2104
thank you
yeah
the order must be confirmed
by someone on the approved list
shit
gene revell
national security advisor

no
weve got to update these fire drills
billy
if the shit ever hits the fan
im not going underground
its a goddamn tomb down there
we have to choose someone else to
face off against besides the russians
really lets see who else has
27000 nukes for us to worry about
its the guy with one im worried about
i have to send some folks to russia
inspect their nuclear decommissioning
facility at armazas
arzamas
yeah whatever
someone from your staff should go
ill go
billy send staff
i want to go
ok
dont underestimate zorkin between
his economy crime chechnya
his liver
whats left of it how is he
hes scheduled a press conference
for today so we know he can sit up
chechnya is part of russia
only criminals and their friends
in the west who wish it to be separate
mr president if you will kindly
come back
do you guys see what i see
his jacket
he used to be able to button it up
hes getting fat
i know how he feels
oh wow look at that
maybe its not the same jacket
yeah it has shiny sleeves he wore it
the last time he got out of the hospital
hes off the diet
and off the wagon he slurred
that must be why cherlinski is there
to keep him off the sauce
wheres cherlinski
next to whats her name
the chick with the brown hair
elena rishkov
that is not cherlinski
bzz busted its cherlinski
youre thinking cherpitski it aint him
i know its cherlinski
no its not trust me
hes next to elena rishkov he was
banging her at the geneva summit
cherlinski was not at geneva
cherpitski was
cherpitski was banging elena rishkov
i just said zorkins putting on weight
why reduce it to sex its disgusting
i agree write it up
if he is putting on weight
that might have health consequences
so get it in the afternoon brief
oh and somebody find out who is
banging elena rishkov this is good
what shall we make of chechnya
asking the west for protection
she is like a beautiful virgin escaping
the clutches of a lecherous bear
and running to bill clinton
to save her maidenhood
a poet once wrote meet the new
boss same as the old boss
he could have been writing of us
of europe in the 21 st century
over 50 years of america and russia
imposing their will
on the european community
east and west
and were still treated like children
but without the toys
or the goodnight chocolates
each day we lose a little bit more
of our separate sovereign ability
to determine our own futures
and each day the world comes just a
little bit closer to that terrible moment
when the beating of a butterflys wings
unleashes a hurricane
god himself cannot stop
so what is it
are you blind
its a bomb
wheres the fuse
its warm
so am i come on
i dont have all night
its a dud
lets get it on the truck
but how can we sell it now
theres always someone
wholl buy this crap
i cannot stand all these questions
about my health
i am to be described as
robust and healthy
is that yours or mine
it must be yours mines just for show
its not the hospital
hi
youre still here
well i think to be accurate
its actually you whos still here
oh right
not that im complaining
jack
i know this is new and all but
i have something i have to say
or im going to explode
i dont want you to be scared
what
youre in love with me
jack im a medical professional
i can read the symptoms
youre definitely in love with me
and that scares you
not even a little
but i think it scares you
no not even a little
and for the record
youre the one who brought it up
forget it
im gonna get it
no way itll stop
i dont know who this is
just go about your business
the timing sucks
do what you have to do i understand
yes this is dr muller
muller you paged me
hello
stop yes this is jack ryan
jesus
ok ill be there in half an hour
i gotta go i have an emergency
at work
i have to go im sorry
cathy how about dinner tonight
yeah
how about tomorrow night
jack i said yes to tonight
i know
what kind of emergency
does a historian have
he died at 0420 zulu 8Â½ hours
later they swore in a new president
who is he
alexander nemerov
youre kidding i wrote a paper
about him a year ago
i said he could be the next guy
i know
nobody read it
theyre reading it now
who
cabot
ive been here 14 months
he doesnt know what i look
are you ryan
yes sir
what is this the paper chase
sir my
come on were late
youre about to breathe air thats way
over your pay grade so listen
youll be asked for advice be sure
you know what youre talking about
dont be afraid to say you dont know
choose your words carefully
they could become policy
hey you give me your coat
come on youll get it back
tie
so intelligence committee
ive watched these on cspan
never actually been to one
youve never watched
one of these on cspan
our most important assessment comes
from a source inside the kremlin
in his opinion nemerov does not owe
his ascension to the military
everyone has opinions mr cabot
i respect that
this morning my wife woke up
and said i was old bald and ugly
is that a question mr chairman
i told her
appearances arent everything
would you agree
i certainly would
now this new fellow nezmeroz
is that his name
nemerov sir
despite what your source says
we hear that nezmeroz is a hardliner
is he a hardliner
no
its too soon to make that assessment
according to cnn
your mr nezmeroz is making promises
to rebuild the russian empire
that sounds pretty rash
from where i sit
if i were sitting in chechnya
id be even more worried
sir nemerov only said that
to get the hardliners off his back
if we leave him alone
russia will stabilise
when i asked for your advice i didnt
mean that you should actually speak
mr cabot
some of our assets in the russian
government who know mr nemerov
have not had a chance to report in
id like to take a couple of days
and gather more information for you
before characterising him
but i do maintain my opinion
that appearances can be deceiving
youre saying im wrong
absolutely mr chairman
i dont think youre ugly
i was out of line i apologise
senators dont like to be surprised
i hint at what im gonna tell them then
i give them a while to get used to it
then i tell them
i understand
good
but im right about nemerov
your girlfriend like
this stubborn streak in you
what
cathy muller
second year surgical resident
baltimore memorial hospital
welcome to the cia sport
your intelligence is a little flawed
i wouldnt call her my girlfriend yet
what exactly would you call her
great amazing
shes just afraid to commit
hes terrified of commitment
a man whos afraid of commitment
after three dates alert the media
i know i know
so what does he do
he was in the marines
before he hurt his back
now hes a historian
yawn
no he works for a think tank
across the river
double yawn
all right rita lets see what you have
to say after we meet him tonight
hes
cute
i have fat fingers
cathy cute scale one to ten
oh god i dont know
twelve
ask them where they found this
in the field in the golan
there was a lot of fighting there
in 1973 did they witness it
this one says he lost his son
does he remember
was there a plane shot down
yes an israeli jet destroyed
this is worthless
but tell him i will give him 400
because of his son
thank thank you
thank you
how did you come by it
i found her in the attic of an old
mansion house in glasgow
your little trip to the attic has got you
a piece worth now about  1000
even in this condition and had she
been in better condition even more
a jolly nice find
in fact what i thought id found
was a garden ornament
hello cathy
hi im glad you called im running late
can you come a half an hour later
i cant make it im really sorry
its a lastminute work thing
whats that noise
im calling from a plane
this just came up i tried to call you
where are you going
i cant tell you that
jack
you cant tell me
jack
hold on yes sir
what are you doing
i had a date tonight so i had to cancel
dont be stupid tell her where youre
going tell her who you work for
shell be impressed
ok i work for the cia
the director asked me to go with him to
russia to do a nuclear arms inspection
hello
that is so lame
i swear we get to inspect to make sure
theyre decommissioning their arsenal
hello
hello
thanks thanks a lot
zdravstvuyte william cabot
president nemerov
pleasure sir
may i present mrs lathrop
mr president
general rand
mr president
dr ryan
mr president
you must be the dr ryan whos done
such interesting research on me
you should not be surprised
we know quite a bit
we know how wrong your report was
that i had many girlfriends in college
i met my wife in my third year and have
not looked at another woman since
i was referring to
the first two years sir
where you received
highest honors in english
i like him
well in that case so do i
i apologise for interjecting myself
in your inspection tour
but i have a message
for president fowler
you could just call him on the phone
i would like him to hear it from you
his friend of many years
who received it personally from me
and saw my expression and the
language of my body as i spoke it
i understand
chechnya is an internal affair
what we do there should be
none of your concern
i will relay the message
but i dont think he will agree
some people in my country
will use this issue to weaken me
some people in my country say
your war in chechnya
is exactly your weakness
chechnya is a nation of criminals
every day brings another cowardly
attack on innocent russian citizens
it is none of your concern
stability is our concern
peace in chechnya is our concern
and if i may speak frankly
your control over your military
concerns us too
for you to get involved here its like
sleeping with another mans wife
and what you are suggesting
is that afterward
they can all live together
under the same roof
but what really happens is
the betrayed husband buys a gun
that went well
whos the guy with nemerov
anatoli grushkov
old kgb
hes been around since brezhnev
nobodys had the guts to get rid of him
because he knows
where the bodies are buried
he probably buried them himself
and we were able to obtain a roster
of their scientists at arzamas
whos who what their expertise is
arzamas16 is home
to the allrussian scientific research
institute of experimental physics
and is the birthplace
of our first atomic bomb
many of our greatest scientists
worked here and many still do
since 1995
we have dismantled
over 10000 nuclear devices
we tried so hard to get in here
over the years
i sent three people
they all died trying
what does the tshirt say
i am a bomb technician if you
see me running try to catch up
ok
sir im sorry just one quick thing
im sure its nothing
according to this there are
17 senior scientists on duty today
i only count 14
doctors milinov orlov and spassky
they dont seem to be here
i will make inquiries
dr milinov is out sick
orlov is on vacation
spassky im grieved to say
was killed
driving his car to work
just this past week
we move on shall we
please
very impressive you almost seem
to have that information memorised
i assumed you would ask dr ryan
we touch down at andrews at 2130
tell him to meet me there
sir those three missing scientists
milinovs expertise is detonators
spasskys expertise
is the nuclear core
orlov is a mathematician
whose expertise is the geometry of
high explosives inside a fission bomb
the exact three men you would need
if you wanted to build a bomb
grushkov said
grushkovs a liar
milinov is not sick
orlov hardly ever takes a vacation
and spassky whos supposed to have
died driving a car doesnt drive
they have no idea
where these guys are
im dying to ask you how you know
secure source inside the kremlin
codename spinnaker
he gives me stuff i give him stuff
we keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster
and speaking of disaster
did you call your girlfriend yet
no i dont know how to get out of this
all right invite her to the white house
correspondents dinner sunday night
its the hottest ticket in town
sounds great how do i get in
trust me
ill see you at the car
still loving your desk job
yeah i am
hows your russian
still works why
three russian nuclear scientists are
missing i need to know where they are
i wasnt doing this any more
i just need information this time
johnny
your orders are on the plane
wheels up at 2330 have a nice flight
sunday night 800 at the hilton the
tickets are in the name of john clark
you do have a tux
yeah yes sir
my beautiful wife julie is from
new jersey 15 electoral votes
and is as you know halfjewish
so well take floridas
25 electoral votes and divide by two
this is a nice hotel
yeah beautiful
my friend rita stayed here once
she said it was nice
maybe after dinner we can
we can get a room here
i already did
you didnt
yes i did
i did on a handful of occasions
smoke marijuana
california 54 electoral votes
at 0600 moscow time the russians
launched a massive artillery strike
against grozny
the capital of chechnya
the shells contained an experimental
chemical weapon a nerve agent
saturation you can see
on the sat photos took 20 minutes
after which every person
inside a radius of 12 miles
was rendered helpless by symptoms
approximating latestage cerebral palsy
oh my god
how many dead
nemerov launched the biggest attack
in the history of chemical warfare
lets talk response
the worst thing we can do is nothing
if he gets away with chemical weapons
whats next biological nuclear
ok short of gassing the kremlin
whats the strongest response
we send in peacekeepers
chechnyas not sovereign
they requested recognition so we
give it not full diplomatic provisional
then the chechens request assistance
and we send in peacekeepers
how do you get them in there
we fly them in from turkey
over armenian air space
to screw russia they wont complain
lets do it nemerov can choke on it
bill
dr ryan
yes sir
what do you think
conventional wisdom suggests
that nemerov is playing
the traditional russian role
be aggressive flex your muscles
dare the world to stop you
but nemerov isnt conventional
he acts like a hardliner
with respect i dont think he is one
he just gassed the capital of another
country with respect youre wrong
so what are we wasting our time for
what if he didnt order the attack
what if nemerov
didnt order the attack
what if it was a a rogue general
or a military unit frustrated they
couldnt get the rebels out of the city
have you reason to believe he didnt
order it or are you just floating this
you dont know
i dont think he did it sir
i would bet he didnt do it
will senior staff remain behind
for a few minutes please
russias newlyinstalled president
alexander nemerov
has just begun to address the state
we join him in progress
for ten years now
we have contended
excuse me could you turn that up
toward innocent russian citizens
finally
every nation has a right
to defend itself
this terrorism must end
the bombing of chechnya
was my decision
nice going ace
who did it
general pildysh general mitkin
unhappy old communists
bastards
relieve them of command
i will shoot them myself
just disappear them
their execution would tell the world
i didnt have control
these days better to appear guilty
than impotent
how is our russian friend
affected by this
i am not affected
i remain devoted to our little plan
at what youre charging us
i am not surprised
and the american
mr mason is a believer
i put a little extra
in the escrow account for him
why
he wont live long enough to get it
where is the package
it left haifa a week ago
im told these things can kill you
but so much has changed
perhaps the new situation suggests
we consider a different approach
maybe try to bring russia
more into europe
more into our way of thinking
we have discussed that
monsieur monceau
and with your concurrence rejected it
oh perhaps we were hasty
perhaps our plan is
is what
not perfectly conceived
are you crazy all over
the world rightwing parties
nationalist movements
nazis aryan nations
all working together for the first time
is that not perfect
well i respect the will and judgment
of my friends
but in light of the weeks events
i am grown
uncomfortable with this plan
so i must beg your leave
gentlemen
herr haft will help you out
your scarf monsieur
watch it with that thing
youre gonna kill somebody
yo whats up mason
you know i always wanted to ask
you whered you get that tat man
the navy
the navy i was in the navy
hospital ship six years you
eight months
oh you wash out
all right brother
you have a good one
yeah brother
not realising the rest of the world is
watching and will take a cue from us
the unprecedented attack
on chechnya
signals a dangerous
and troubling shift in russian policy
it demands the toughest and most
unambiguous response from the west
nato forces are on their way to
chechnya to serve as peacekeepers
and to provide humanitarian aid
to victims of this monstrous
i expected this
really
what will you do
nothing
we will do nothing
these are four hours old russian
12th 15th and 2nd tank regiments
why havent they moved
nemerovs too smart to move them
he speaks
jack nemerovs got like 19000
tanks no way nato can match that
thats why hes not gonna move them
its like chess
hes thinking three moves ahead
the nato playbook says we can only
stop him with tactical nuclear weapons
and he wont risk a nuclear war
over this
i also think hes sending us
a message he didnt bomb grozny
excuse me
im looking for mrs spassky
at the end of the corridor
i havent seen sasha since university
and you were his teaching assistant
strange i dont remember you
when he heard i was in arzamas
he asked me to look in on you
he says hell take me to the west
that would require a lot of money
just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesnt mean others wont
he has a secret job
for the government
for imbeciles with money
same nonsense do this dont do that
they even told him
not to call his mother
the pigs
i could die any day
and he cant phone his mother
but my sasha he called
just last night
clark got us her number nsa traced
calls to that number back to here
its an abandoned soviet army base
on the kremenchug reservoir
what are three russian atomic
scientists doing in ukraine
a fair guess theyre building a bomb
nemerov has thousands of bombs
why would he build a secret one
deniability
build one nobody knows about he can
drive it to chechnya in his beemer
no way to track it no way to trace it
he could set it off and say
i didnt do it
with respect i dont think
that adds up
it adds up you just dont like
what it adds up to
ah the warmth of plutonium decay
its completely corroded
at least youre wearing gloves
anyone want to light up
an american cigarette
youre crazy
im going out
the explosive blocks
must be replaced
machined to a thousandth
of a millimetre
in a mathematically determined
configuration
do we have a bomb
first we must analyse the yield
do we have a bomb
yes
yes we do
this is a a test
answer it
answer it
are you sure
hello
yes
yes sir
i have to go outside for just a second
ok ill be right back
ill be right back
sir i write reports
i reviewed your military records
you can take care of yourself
yes sir but im not trained for that
im not asking you to be an operations
officer just my eyes and ears i cant go
so this isnt sanctioned
i want you to give this to clark
see what he finds out bring it home
yes sir
jack
we never had this discussion
what discussion
ok clark so this is
three days ago
it shows vehicles here
guards here and here
i gotta get one of those
now the infrared satellite
took this photograph 34 hours ago
that shows guards here and here
i dont even have email
there are two at the checkpoint
between two and five in the barracks
and two with the package
which we believe to be here
no problem give me a couple
of guys some tranquilliser darts
we can be out in six minutes
there is a problem
whats that
this is yesterday
no guards visible at all
why is that a problem mr ryan
for two reasons either we cant
see them which is bad
or worse they left and were too late
suit up
what
you cant go dressed like that
no no im an analyst
i dont go on missions
relax 007 its not a mission
its just a recce
ok fine whatever you call it
i dont do that i just write reports
ok so write a report about it suit up
clark no
clark no
so cabot tells me you got my ticket
to the correspondents dinner
have a good time
ive never been to one of those
i was actually looking forward to it
clark no im not going in there
goddamn right youre gonna stay here
and make sure no one steals my boat
be right back
damn
oh jesus
oh god immigration didnt
call you guys huh
im sorry you speak english
i dont speak much ukrainian
its not what you think im an
american citizen i have my papers
ok no papers
please just put the gun down
the light you want
me to put the light down
ok take it easy
ill put the light down
here we go im putting it down
shoot him ryan
shoot him
shoot him before he figures out
what im saying
get their shoes
what
tell them to take their shoes off
you speak ukrainian
yeah you dont
whatever it is they were spray painting
was big about the size of a fridge
the imprint it left was deep
so we know three things
it was heavy something was
radioactive and now its gone
one of them spoke english
south african
so whats a south african
doing in the ukraine
with three russian scientists
and a crate from israel
tell cabot ill call him from haifa
i have a feeling you better hurry
most people believe the 20th century
was defined by the death struggle
of communism versus capitalism
and that fascism was but a hiccup
today we know better
communism was a fools errand the
followers of marx gone from this earth
but the followers of hitler
abound and thrive
hitler however
had one great disadvantage
he lived in a time when fascism
like a virus
like the aids virus
needed a strong host in order to spread
germany was that host
but strong as it was
germany could not prevail
the world was too big
fortunately the world has changed
global communications
cable tv the internet
today the world is smaller
and the virus does not need
a strong host in order to spread
this virus
is airborne
one more thing
let no man call us crazy
they called hitler crazy but hitler
wasnt crazy he was stupid
you dont fight russia and america
you get russia and america
to fight each other
and destroy each other
what did you find
ukraines exports are online
i pulled up the shipping manifests
the only crate that size was picked up
at kiev international ten days ago
and flown to the canary islands
the air force has a nuclear
assessment team call them
jack it got put on a cargo freighter
headed for the east coast
what
baltimore its coming here
its a great view from the budweiser
blimp as we count down to game time
well have the pregame festivities
as well as the arrival of the nations
number one football fan in a moment
then conquer we must
for our cause it is just
and this be our motto
in god is our trust
and the starspangled banner
forever shall wave
oer the land of the free
get me the duty officer
home of the brave
ladies and gentlemen
the president of the united states
robert fowler
showtime

after grozny you hope it wasnt us
we are drafting
a strong denial for you
and a statement of sympathy
and yuri order all military
on the alert
hey its ryan
jack where are you
somewhere outside baltimore
cabot got the president out
where is he now
theyre taking him airborne on naoc
they think it might be the russians
it wasnt the russians i gotta talk to
cabot patch me through to the plane
cabots not on the plane we dont
know where he is call back in an hour
we dont have an hour
fowlers gonna want to hit back now
listen we have to prove it wasnt the
russians before hes convinced it is
can you get back to langley
theres no time the radiation
assessment team where are they
stambler tunnels south of the city
the prevailing winds are blowing
the fallout to the east and north
as long as you stay south youre ok
mr president are you all right
how the hell do you think i am
how many casualties
we dont know
how the hell did it get there
we dont know radar didnt pick it up
well how is cabot where is he
i dont know
what do you know
i dont know all right i dont know
i dont know
general kondor is not on board
send the afrat team
mr president i recommend
we move to defcon2
wheres our intelligence
russian air defences
are at their highest level
maybe theyre afraid of being attacked
i cant get this goddamn chair open
were about to take off
we dont know who did it
we think the russians
you think
sir defcon2
were groping in the dark
this is too much goddamn bullshit
and not enough fact
the blast crater is about
100 150 yards wide
which suggests a lowyield device
quite a bit smaller
than the hiroshima bomb
a quarter of a square mile
around the stadium is just gone
beyond that buildings remain heavily
damaged for another quarter mile
the damage tapers off the farther
you get from ground zero
dubinin
herr haft has left for america
now we are counting on you
i assure you
i will earn every pfennig
attention
youve heard of the bomb in the usa
what you havent heard
is that 15 minutes ago
an american icbm hit moscow
we are to retaliate against an american
aircraft carrier in the north sea
man your aircraft
the ash isnt radioactive the winds
are blowing the fallout to sea
captain jack ryan cia
lorna shiro you need to wait outside
i need to know all you know
about the bomb
were collecting samples get in line
and well have the report out tomorrow
captain i need to know now
where this bomb came from
or even where it didnt come from
or there may not be a tomorrow
shit wesson where are you
about a quarter mile from ground zero
this is about as far as well go
my feet are sizzling
im getting rads
nearly the limit of our gear
ok cut the rover loose and get out
roger that
dillon the crate the bomb was shipped
in somebody had to sign for it at port
customs must have a database
get me a name wheres cabot
no one knows
were checking the hospitals
have you tried memorial
he wouldnt be there
no i mean is it still
its cathys hospital
as far as i know its still there
but the phones are down
all right can you keep checking
thanks
they could have launched
a cruise missile
we dont know that this is russia
we dont know its not
if they were sending us a message
theyd want us to know it was them
except they could inspire
the confusion were going through now
mr president were uplinked
president nemerov theres been a
major nuclear event in the united states
loss of life is severe
it was no accident
it was not an accident
we dont yet know where
it came from we dont
we have not yet ascertained the
source of this weapon rest assured
we have not yet ascertained
the source of this weapon
but rest assured those responsible
will be dealt with most severely
hes fishing
send our reply
whoa that was a little fast
please accept the deepest
sympathies of the russian people
if it was deliberate
this is a crime without precedent
what madman would do such a thing
and for what purpose
you must believe that russia had
nothing to do with this infamous act
its canned
he prepared that in advance
president nemerov weve no reason
to suspect russian involvement
at this time
but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression
he thinks we did this
we must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons
they have to understand that
attacking russia would be suicide
increase the alert status
tao ew im picking up
intermittent radar bearing 020
where
now its gone
there its a weak signal
tao inbound contact
multiples on the same bearing
vampire vampire
fast movers inbound
i got seven eight nine of them
the missiles definitely came
from russian aircraft
grennel thinks he can save the ship
but flight ops are out
i ordered no such attack
you must not respond to this action
until we investigate all possibilities
like you did in chechnya
mr president who is in control
of your armed forces
you dropped the bomb on hiroshima
you dropped the bomb on nagasaki
do not lecture me on chechnya
lecture me on chechnya
mr president we are now at a
de facto state of war with the russians
john clark was in haifa yesterday
we have to find him right away
wow
look at that gadolinium reading
yeah the mass fraction is huge
ok connect me to dillon ill hold
there it is savannah river
oh yeah
oh yeah what
they had a gadolinium problem
hanford does it another way
and generate too much promethium
hold on can you translate that
into english
this plutonium came from the doe
plant at savannah river february 68
from k reactor we even know
which part of k reactor
wait this is our plutonium
made in the usa
dillon youve got to find cabot
are you advocating we launch
a first strike
it is not a first strike theres already
been a first strike and a second
dont you get it
no i dont get it
i dont understand why we have
to nuke them its not reasonable
sidney goddamn it
they practically sank
an aircraft carrier
their missile silos are hot
were getting bullshit from nemerov
lets not forget how this started
they tried to kill me remember
dont fucking tell me to be reasonable
please come to the triage tent
on the side of the building
we will help you find
who you are looking for
but we are low on blood supply
sir
sir
hi
what
president
the presidents fine
hes fine sir
the bomb the plutonium
wife
what
wife
your wife im sure shes fine
shes in dc
the blast radius wasnt that
it wasnt that wide
sir listen to me
the plutonium was ours
john clarks in haifa to track down
the arms dealer i cant get hold of him
i dont know what to do
girl girlfriend
she
she works in baltimore so
i dont know
spinnaker
what
spinnaker
sir
bill
yeah we found the receiver address
for the crate
port of baltimore
can you get to the docks
find the transcon warehouse
the name on the manifest is mason
sorry i need this truck
come on
shit
sir weve come up
with another alternative
a conventional attack on the airbase
where the carrier attack originated
its a measured response
nonnuclear
is it strong enough
smart bombs and f16s
cant afford for them to see us as weak
theyve got to know we have the guts
to take it to the next level
i think theyll get that message
hit em
eagles nest this is eagle one
we have target acquired target is lit
to make no response
is to invite a greater attack
american submarines from norfolk
and kings bay are putting to sea
they carry trident d3 missiles
a first strike weapon
fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike
perhaps he doesnt think
its the first strike
once their stealth bombers go up
we will have no choice
that will be the sign
how do we convince him
not to launch his bombers
maybe we should
bring our missiles to highest alert
theyd be crazy to attack then
can i have your attention
the generator has gone out
theres broken glass everywhere stay
where you are we will get back to
ok fine please stay where you are
well get you one by one
sir can you hear me
can you feel your arms and legs
what have you got
what do we do with the ones
we know wont make it
whatever we can
what
bill cabot died
im really sorry
this cant be happening
sir we have a call from langley
thank you
becker
this is jack ryan
great the nemerov apologist
sir this bomb was not nemerov
i know this guy
you said that after grozny
put it in your report
the plutonium
seems unusual to find
radiation poisoning here
i have never seen such a thing
that is why we published the case
on the internet to seek help
how did he say it happened
he will not talk about it
was anyone else exposed
to the materials that made you sick
mr ghazi im not the police
im a physician i assure you
anything you say stays between us
my friend and i find bomb
we sell to a man
who buys such things
was it this man
other people may have come
in contact with that bomb
we must help them
i am going to die
yes
yes
his name is olson
he live in damascus
oh yeah were getting it all
a nuclear strike on colorado springs
would take out norad
it would limit their ability
to launch a counterattack
how many people live
in colorado springs
three or four hundred thousand
mr president to use nuclear weapons
against the americans
would be to cross a threshold
they think we already have should
we now wait for them to annihilate us
i cannot stop what i did not start
mr president we need you
to initiate snapcount
what happens then
we prepare to take out their landbased
missiles with a nuclear strike
find and kill their subs knock out
the planes they have on the ground
and mobilise our fighters to destroy
the ones they already have in the air
what are our chances
david
odds are we leave nemerov
in a pretty pickle
hell be left with at best
a few hundred nukes
the ones we cant find
mostly the smaller more mobile
less accurate kind
all those can do is target our cities
but he knows to an absolute certainty
that we will respond against his cities
i spent my entire adult life
wanting to be president
this is my presidency
sir i think hell keep his 300 nukes as a
deterrent against any future aggressor
i think hell push back from the table
and call it a night
im giving the order for snapcount
maximum readiness
olson had wire payments of 45 million
from someone named dressler
dillon find out who dressler is

i understand
sir put the card down
back off
i am ordering you
back off
step back now i am ordering
you to take a step back put
general theres a dr ryan
from the cia
he wants to enter nmcc
hes unescorted
whats he want
you sir
i have a message from director cabot
that i need to transmit over the hotline
whats your authorisation
i dont have one
wheres cabot
cabots dead sir
i need to get this information sent
not without authorisation get him out
wait general the president is basing
his decisions on bad information
if you shut me out
your family and my family
and 25 million other families
will be dead in 30 minutes
my orders are to get this information
to the people who make the decisions
i just need to send some information
what makes you think
the president will listen to you
he doesnt have to
how close are the bombers
theyre slipping in and out of radar
over poland
activate the missile regiments
the launch sequence takes a minute
to process after you give the order
before the order can be taken
an id check must be performed
mine is the my number is
the third one third number down
from the top
your orders sir
strike
im sorry sir
i give the order to strike
under the twoman rule the order
to strike must now be confirmed
bob for the love of god
just do it
sidney owens secretary of state
its the fourth number down
the order to strike has now been
confirmed by the twoman rule
nmcc strike order has been
confirmed start the sequence
weve got activity on the hotline
theyve had their chance
no somebodys talking to the kremlin
it says america has been the victim
of a terrorist attack
as you can imagine there has
been much confusion here
and fear
but we know the weapon
was not russian
but we know the weapon
was not russian
what the hell is going on
type exactly what i say
who are we talking to
ryan i met you in moscow with
bill cabot he died today in baltimore
cut him off
launch sequence has begun
two months ago
a neofascist named dressler bought
an abomb on the black market
cut him off
the system cant be cut off
then get someone to stop him
he paid three disaffected russian
scientists to make the bomb active
he shipped it to the us
where a man named mason
was hired to deliver the bomb and
set our countries on a collision course
this is madness he is cia
we cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy
what is the harm of listening
a bit more
what are you asking of me
back down
what guarantee do i have that
president fowler will follow suit
none
you see he is wasting time
we must launch now
we have only moments
sir i know you had nothing to do
with the baltimore bomb
and you know you didnt but youre
still about to launch a nuclear strike
yes sir thats all dr ryan
this is about fear
fear of your missiles
fear of our subs
fear of being weak
of making a mistake
the fear of the other guy that had us
build these bombs in the first place
it stopped
they cut him off
they are going to strike
prepare the launch orders now
30 seconds to launch
oh my god mr president
we will maintain our defensive alert
for the moment
but our offensive forces
are withdrawn
if you match this i propose a phased
mutual stand down over five hours
stop the launch sequence
lasseter here flash override
stop the sequence
order the planes to stand down
take us to defcon3
and would somebody ask mr ryan
if i can use the phone now
youre still here
there is no more fitting memorial
for those who perished in this tragedy
than the steps weve taken this week
toward a multinational campaign
to root out and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction
we embarked on this course because
we have learned at too great a cost
that if the most powerful weapons
ever created are unleashed
they will be fired not in anger
but in fear
dr ryan
mr grushkov
it is a lovely day
yeah
im sorry this is
dr muller how do you do
nice to meet you
why am i not surprised
you know her name
our friend william thought
i was a spy
of course he could never prove it
he never told me you were friends
maybe he didnt know you well enough
he told me he had a source in russia
to keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster
kennedy said
our most basic common link
is that we all inhabit
this small planet
we all breathe the same air
we all cherish our childrens future
and were all mortal
i will miss so very much
talking to william
me too
perhaps from time to time
you and i can talk
yeah id like that
what is this
