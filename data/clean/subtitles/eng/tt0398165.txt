being pursued by police 
we re receiving word now
that the driver of that vehicle
is former pittsburgh football star
paul crewe 
crewe 
you might remember 
was the only man ever to be indicted
on federal racketeering charges
for shaving points
in a professional football game 
although it was never
fully proven 
yeah 
  yello 
  do not get one more scratch
on my car 
or i will slit your throat 
see  that s our problem 
sweetie 
you care about this car
more than you do us 
and how d you even know
there was a scratch on this baby 
because i am watching you on tv 
as is the whole country 
once again 
you are proving to everyone
what a worthless piece of shit
you are 
well  i hope they like this 
hey  lena 
i think we should start
seeing other people 
i think i m in love 
good news  boys 
i didn t spill my beer 
without question  crewe s five year
federal probation for point shaving
has been severely
violated tonight 
the future of this once great football
star looks very dark indeed 
long way from the big city 
huh  superstar 
staying with the times
around here  huh 
ain t she beau ta ful 
home sweet home  boy 
get on your feet 
you re one lucky
son of a bitch  crewe 
  is that right 
  that s right 
see  the warden loves
his football 
fact  he was on the winning side
of your little thing 
  well  tell him congratulations 
  but i wasn t 
welcome to allenville 
thank you  sergeant 
i ll take it from here 
  afternoon  inmate crewe 
  yeah 
come on 
warden wants to see you 
let s do it 
move it 
i used to play
a little college ball myself 
down at
the university of miami 
i bet a lot of your old teammates
are locked up in here 
no inmates from my playing days 
couple of guards  though 
see  we got us a fine
prison guard league down here 
it s like a   
company softball team 
now  the warden   
he s gonna ask you
to help out 
okay  with what 
that wasn t nice 
when the warden
asks you 
  what are you gonna say 
  yes 
you re gonna tell him  no  
you got it 
you re gonna tell
the warden
that you want nothing to do
with his football fantasies 
not in my back yard 
because the warden
don t run this prison  i do 
  you understand 
  not entirely 
okay  i feel you  dog 
i feel you 
paul  wrecking  crewe 
i don t get to say this
to my new guests very often 
but it s an honor to have you
here at this institution 
it s an honor to be
locked up here  sir 
oh  this is  uh 
errol dandridge 
colonel sanders
been eating his own chicken 
he s my political adviser 
see  i ve been approached
by several very influential people
wondering if i d be interested
in standing for governor 
they see the way i run this prison 
think maybe i should run this state 
only with less sodomy 
right 
hopefully none 
sorry 
now  there are two things we take very
seriously here in the state of texas 
prison and football 
we play
a little of the latter here 
uh  the warden is too modest to admit
that his team is rather good 
but not good enough 
five years since
our last championship 
five years 
now  i ve worked real hard 
pulled strings 
called in quite a few favors
to get you here  paul 
now  why would you go
and do that 
because i am convinced that
you can get us back on track 
i haven t played football in i don t
know how long  i don t really want to 
you wouldn t be playing  paul 
just    just consulting 
anyone who was once the mvp
of the national football league
must have a great deal
of expertise to offer 
captain  what would you say
to mr  crewe looking in 
giving us the benefit
of his experience 
oh  i think that s a real good idea  warden 
we can use all the help we can get 
well  then  it s all settled 
whatcha say  paul 
i appreciate the offer 
but i m gonna have to pass 
now  i can assure you
that your time here will be a whole
lot easier if you just participate 
i just wanna do my time
and go home  nothing else 
if you ll excuse us 
mr  crewe 
captain knauer 
you can stay 
sit down 
i used to love
your underwear commercials 
thank you very much 
my ex husband wore the
same brand of tighty whities 
he didn t fill  em out
quite as well as you  though

who drank
all the damn gatorade  
  damn it 
  and apparently steroids 
look  seems like you got all the talent
you d want  so why do you need me 
well  now  you might
find this hard to believe 
but there s some folks here in the prison
league don t care for me very much 
  you  warden 
  yeah  well  they thought it might be amusing
to schedule the defending
league champs as our first game 
and me  well  i thought
an old pro like yourself
might have some training camp tricks 
drills  insights to offer up 
give us the competitive edge 
all right  relatively simple 
you need a tune up game 
a tune up game 
yeah  in college  we d start every
season against the appalachian state
or some slack division 2 team 
kick the living shit out of them 
get their confidence up

you re gonna assemble a team

they re running a standard wishbone 
so you re telling me that these animals
are watching our game films 
  is that right 
  yes  sir  boss

to do something about this 
w w what do you

what are you doin

how does he listen
to that cracker shit 
we re here deep in the heart
of toothless country 
coming to you from a simple
texas high school stadium
that s been retrofitted
for the big event 
now  when my man travis
tried to drag me out here  i said
 what are you  brain dead from
talking to too many raider fans 
it s not going to work  
but the fact of the matter is 
this could shape up as an epic day 
hot dog vendors  high powered rifles 
i love the combination 
and apparently
so do the fans 
hey  shitheads 
listen up 
everybody on their feet
for the warden 
anthony  wow 
you can sit down 
thank god 
gentlemen  texas marshals
have been kind enough
to supply us with a dozen
of their finest sharpshooters 
so for those of you thinking
of mingling with the civilians
or trying to make
a break for it 
you will be shot 
in the head 
now  let s all go out there
and have some fun 
crewe 
i ll see you on the field 
i think he s
in love with you 
all right  listen up 
i know it s hard to get psyched for
the game without caretaker being here 
but somehow that sick 
skinny bastard
found a way to get us all fired up
from beyond the grave 
caretaker s last gift to us 
battle  i presume
this is yours 
i still don t think
that s big enough 
  that s it 
  no  that ain t it 
caretaker said he d find us
some gear to wear 
i think he found us
a name too 
mean machine  mean machine

and he will score 
sweet dreams  bitch

more interested in hitting the guards
than tackling the ball carrier 
hey  mom  hey  dad

start for the cons 
come here  all right  you got  im 
now  protect me 
let s go  hold them 
and here comes knauer and that
big offensive unit for the guards 
back to your cell 
hut  hut

where he ll come up short 
but look at turley
push the pile 
and now crewe 
and that s a first down 
and look out  boy  somebody better
take control of this game soon 
or they re gonna need body bags
on the sidelines 
  let s go  guys 
  come on 
start of the second quarter 
cons still down by two touchdowns 
but they finally have some momentum 
hut 
crewe with a shovel pass
to megget 
and megget scrambles
for a first down 
oh ho ho  you fooled me 
  i got you there  didn t i 
  you did 
you know what  engleheart  you are
the best looking guy on your team no kiddin  
you know  paul  in the midst of all this 
for you to say something like that is   
come on  let s go 
let s go  d 
first and 10
at the guards  35 
crewe dumps it over the middle
to deacon moss 
and he s hammered at the 17 for a
13 yard pickup  and that s a first down 
  hut 
  crewe  trying to get his team
on the scoreboard 
he will throw 
and it s caught by deacon moss
for a touchdown 
all right 
and so there ll be no shutout today 
as the cons are on the board 
quit booing  people 
both teams are trying very hard 
what the hell s wrong with you 
stop acting like a damn cheerleader 
  sportsmanship  try it 
  shut up 
damn 
2 11 left in the first half 
and dunham is back in at fullback 
and he is a load 
at 6 2   260 
dunham  breaking tackles 
he refuses to go down 
but he finally does
after a 15 yard gain 
that s how a white man
runs a football 
if i was on d  i d crack you square
in that egg ass head o  yours 
yeah  but you ain t on d 
are you  bitch 
switowski  come  ere 
do you know what

an answer for dunham 
who s averaging close to
12 yards a carry this half 
green 67

you sent caretaker to your cell 
bullshit 
captain knauer says
he saw you planning it with unger 
there s no way
that could hold up in court 
court 
hell  boy  in allenville 
i m the judge  i m the jury 
and in your particular case 
i m the executioner 
  what do you want 
  i want you to lose 
i can t do that 
course you can  after all 
you ve had plenty of practice 
but the men  it s more important
to them than it is to you 
okay  suit yourself 
spend the next 25 years
of your useless life in prison 
all right  i ll do it 
but i don t want my guys hurt 
you get ahead  you coast  we clear 
fine  right after i get
a two touchdown lead 
i tell you what bothers me
the most  warden

out there on that field with us 
gettin  what you got
comin  to you 
the only thing comin  to me
is victory 
mean machine

captain 
may i have a word 
don t worry  warden 
we ll take care of business 
i already have 
what  we can win this
on our own 
captain  a man in my position
doesn t leave things to chance 
now  after you get a comfortable
three touchdown lead 
i want you to inflict as much pain
as humanly possible 
do not let up  you hear 
i want those cons to understand
who owns  em 
  do i make myself clear 
  oh  yes  sir

there s the kickoff  and we re
under way in the second half 
megget is finally brought down
at the guards  33 
where paul crewe
will take over 
and what a first half
he s had 
here we go  here we go 
down  set 
y 45  hut

crewe will pass 
he s got deacon wide open 
oh  incomplete

come on  paulie 
second and 10 from the 33  crewe s
looking for deacon once again 
  he s open 
  he s open 
but overthrows it 
and it s picked off by papajohn 
look out  he might go 
say goodbye 
touchdown 
the first mistake
crewe s made all day 
short memory  baby 
we ll get it back  we ll get it back 
defense  let s do this 
8 38 left
in the third quarter 
and crewe has struggled
thus far in the second half 
hut 
the pitch to megget 
oh  my  that ball is live 
it s picked up by lambert 
he s at the 15  the 10 
and he will score 
yeah  touchdown  yeah 
crewe took a shot on that play
and he s getting up slowly 
meanwhile  in the end zone  the guards
have something to celebrate 
as they find themselves up
by two touchdowns 
this is simply a different paul crewe
we re seeing here in the second half 
there s the old paul crewe
we love to write about 
what the hell are you
doin  out there 
i m done 
i m out  that s it 
  where you hurtin  
  my knee 
  seems okay to me 
  well  it ain t 
if crewe can t go  i don t know how
deep these guys are at quarterback 
the guards will try to keep it away
from megget  so they ll pooch kick 
fair catch  fair catch 
as big tony calls for
the fair catch 
watch out  that was as late
a hit as i ve ever seen 
and even some of the home crowd
not liking that one 
hang in there  partner 
can o  corn  can o  corn 
and i ll be fine  can o  corn 
yeah  i d have a hard time
looking at me too 
brucie

this offense  son  now  do it 
coming into the game 
replacing the injured paul crewe

time to shine  baby 
okay  down  set  hut 
there s the snap and the ball is
fumbled  and the guards recover 
i    knew i shouldn t
have had that popcorn 
the guards are in command here
as we move late into the third quarter 
ninety eight  hut  hut 
the give is to potter 
back to knauer 
he s got a man open
deep downfield 
he ll throw
the flea flicker 
and he s got it 
touchdown  guards 
and this game is starting
to look like a blowout 
hey  man  after all caretaker did 
this is how you show him love 
don t worry about it 
you haven t changed
one damn bit 
all right  down  set 
back in at quarterback
is brucie 
who will try to find a handle
on the ball this time 
throw it  brucie 
oh  shit 
and look out 
ooh  what a shot he took 
how much more blood
do you want 
i think the cons are just about
out of options at quarterback 
hey  skitchy 
let me ask you something 
when you popped the warden 
was it worth it 
was it worth spendin 
the rest of your life in here 
was it worth it  it was worth
every goddamn second 
what the hell is he doin  
paul crewe must be feeling better 
because    here he comes 
all right  i missed you guys 
so i m back 
we got a lot of work to do 
let s get it goin  
deuce right  89 
fly on two  ready 
break 
as we start the fourth quarter 
cons down by three touchdowns 
wide left  tight left 
black 90  hut  hut 
here comes the blitz 
and no one s blocking 
and crewe will be sacked
for a big loss 
that looked like a message to crewe
from his offensive line 
did you see that  man 
they re quittin  on  im 
okay  baby 
jailbreak blitz  ready 
we got that out of the way 
i deserved it 
  now we gotta play some football 
  switch it  switch it 
cons need to do something
to get back in this game 
and that s not it 
and crewe is leveled 
i don t think he s gonna get up
from that one 
  nice hit 
  oh  yeah 
but he is  and i don t know how 
after that last hit 
all right  punt team 
keep them off the field 
we re goin  for it 
dumbshits are goin  for it

on fourth and 20 
the cons are gonna go for it 
this could be the ball game right here 
red 98  hut  hut 
crewe dodges the blitz 
but he loses his helmet 
and he s not going down 
he s got the first down 
time out

huddle up 
look 
i m sure you already know this 
but i never said it out loud 
i did throw that game

i was in a bad way
with some worse people 
after i did it 
i felt so shitty i wish    wish
i would have just let them kill me instead 
now    the warden wants to pin
caretaker s murder on me
if i don t throw this game 
so it looks like i m gonna get
to know you guys a lot better

his way for a 9 yard gain

line  where it ll be first and goal 
hut

that was some rumbling  bumbling
stumbling right there 
and listen to the crowd
as this underdog con team
is startin  to win them over 
third down and 6  guards have
the ball on their own 29 yard line 
knauer needs a first down
to put this game away 
white 50

he knocks the ball loose 
there s a dogpile in the backfield 
the refs are trying to sort it out 
ah  my arm 
the cons recover 
yeah  we got the ball  we got the ball 
we got it  we got it 
with just over two minutes left to be
played  this has turned into a game 
crewe will start in great
field position at the guards  25 
and look at this formation 
the guards  they re confused 
shift over  move 
they re trying to call time out 
but there s the snap 
moss is behind a wall of cons  i
wouldn t wanna be in front of that thing 
and they ll score 
  hey  is that legal
