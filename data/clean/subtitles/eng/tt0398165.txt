for shaving points
in a professional football game
although it was never
fully proven

violated tonight
the future of this oncegreat football
star looks very dark indeed
long way from the big city
huh superstar
staying with the times
around here huh
aint she beautaful
home sweet home boy
get on your feet
youre one lucky
son of a bitch crewe
is that right
thats right
see the warden loves
his football
fact he was on the winning side
of your little thing
well tell him congratulations
but i wasnt
welcome to allenville
thank you sergeant
ill take it from here
afternoon inmate crewe
yeah
come on
warden wants to see you
lets do it
move it
i used to play
a little college ball myself
down at
the university of miami
i bet a lot of your old teammates
are locked up in here
no inmates from my playing days
couple of guards though
see we got us a fine
prisonguard league down here
its like a
company softball team
now the warden
hes gonna ask you
to help out
okay with what
that wasnt nice
when the warden
asks you
what are you gonna say
yes
youre gonna tell him no
you got it
youre gonna tell
the warden
that you want nothing to do
with his football fantasies
not in my back yard
because the warden
dont run this prison i do
you understand
not entirely
okay i feel you dog
i feel you
paul wrecking crewe
i dont get to say this
to my new guests very often
but its an honor to have you
here at this institution
its an honor to be
locked up here sir
oh this is uh
errol dandridge
colonel sanders
been eating his own chicken
hes my political adviser
see ive been approached
by several very influential people
wondering if id be interested
in standing for governor
they see the way i run this prison
think maybe i should run this state
only with less sodomy
right
hopefully none
sorry
now there are two things we take very
seriously here in the state of texas
prison and football
we play
a little of the latter here
uh the warden is too modest to admit
that his team is rather good
but not good enough
five years since
our last championship
five years
now ive worked real hard
pulled strings
called in quite a few favors
to get you here paul
now why would you go
and do that
because i am convinced that
you can get us back on track
i havent played football in i dont
know how long i dont really want to
you wouldnt be playing paul
just just consulting
anyone who was once the mvp
of the national football league
must have a great deal
of expertise to offer
captain what would you say
to mr crewe looking in
giving us the benefit
of his experience
oh i think thats a real good idea warden
we can use all the help we can get
well then its all settled
whatcha say paul
i appreciate the offer
but im gonna have to pass
now i can assure you
that your time here will be a whole
lot easier if you just participate
i just wanna do my time
and go home nothing else
if youll excuse us
mr crewe
captain knauer
you can stay
sit down
i used to love
your underwear commercials
thank you very much
my exhusband wore the
same brand of tighty whities
he didnt fill em out
quite as well as you though
special effects hollywood
not all me
oh i doubt that
very seriously
well then get him
enthusiastic damn it

youd want so why do you need me
well now you might
find this hard to believe
but theres some folks here in the prison
league dont care for me very much
you warden
yeah well they thought it might be amusing
to schedule the defending
league champs as our first game
and me well i thought
an old pro like yourself
might have some trainingcamp tricks
drills insights to offer up
give us the competitive edge
all right relatively simple
you need a tuneup game
a tuneup game
yeah in college wed start every
season against the appalachian state
or some slack division 2 team
kick the living shit out of them
get their confidence up
you know something
paul
youve just given me an inspiration

i still dont think
thats big enough

as we start the fourth quarter
cons down by three touchdowns
wide left tight left
black 90 hut hut

from his offensive line
