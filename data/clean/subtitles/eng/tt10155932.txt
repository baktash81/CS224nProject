the changing of the guard
waits for no one
cinderella
yeah
do you think i look pretty
i think you look so pretty

what matters is how you feel
when you look in the mirror
thats deep
how do i feel
about myself
uh
yeah i do
i feel pretty
cool
you have dirt on your face
malvolia laughing
please girls
were going to be late
what is that
its a dress
i made it
why
i dont know
ii just thought
since the whole kingdom
will be there today
i could find someone
who will maybe buy it
laughter
to think that any girl
let alone you
would have the audacity
to engage
in matters of business
its insane
i will not have you
embarrassing this household
with your blasphemy
dont ever let me catch you
trying such nonsense again
put the dress down
yes stepmother
good
now shoulders back
grunts
no slouching
and smile
every girl is worth more
when she smiles
sighs
door closes
what are you doing
i am stewing in my own anger
softly
oh okay
you turned down the daughter
of lord reginald
i guess she wasnt the one
she was
i wouldve had control
of all the territories
right up to the domain
of the sea monster
well perhaps you should marry
the sea monster robert
i would have to have
grandmothers ring resized
laughs
you keep overlooking
his behavior
and hell never grow out of it
stop
hes gonna make a fine king
is it me
or is your throne
just a little bit taller
than it was yesterday
sputtering sigh
i mean it really looks
oh dont be ridiculous
quite a bit
and even if it is
i have every right
to make it taller
im king
mm yes
and i am ridiculous
if you need me
i shall be in my chambers
brushing my hair
until it all falls out
so we good
cause i got a thing
uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh
youre bringing shame
on this family robert
have you seen this
robert the roundabout players
present the kings idiot son
chuckles ooh do you think
we can still get tickets
im becoming a laughingstock
i think youre overreacting
well why dont you ask
the roundabout players
if im overreacting
they are currently
in a dark windowless room
under the castle
you cant leave actors alone
in a basement without attention
theyll die
when you marry
youll settle down
youll stop behaving
like my idiot son
and the perception
of the people will be
that you take the crown
seriously
you cant control me
choir singing in distance
oh thats exactly
what i can do
thats the perk
of being the king
but i feel nothing
for these women
its crazy to think
im actually gonna
fall in love with one of them
kings marry for power
not for love
choir continues singing
oh well its perfect then
that mother came with
three castles
and a hundred horses
or i suppose
i never wouldve been born
silence
choir gasps
dont talk about
what you dont understand hmm
continue to defy me
and just out of spite
ill give it all the crown
the palace
everything to your sister
choir
bumbumbum
leave us gwen
sorry
i would be embarrassed
if i wasnt so bored
with my life
but since im here
i would love to stay
and help sort out
this whole crown issue
youve been excused gwen
right
but would this be a good time
for me to mention
how the kingdom could use
the power of the wind
instead of burning filthy coal
go
father you know how badly
i want to be king
i do chuckles softly
now to make sure your nuptials
are done properly and on my
schedule we shall hold a ball
a ball
no
balls are fun
yes well invite
every woman of worth
youll dance
youll be charming
you shall find a bride

ddancing at these things
is so mannered
and formal
we look like fools
of course we do
but women love it
good god robert
if a rich man ever lost a woman
it was to a man who could dance
why do i have to explain
everything to you
this is insane
i cant just pick
some bride at a ball
and then what
laughs werewere supposed
to grow old together
into our 40s
i mean what are we even

unnecessary
you know i cant believe
that youre willing to sully
the dignity of the royal family
for some commoner
wilbur you sound old
im just
just what
shesshes beautiful
shes witty shes fearless
i mean holy hell did you see
the way she talked to my father
so mouthy
and glorious
i must know her
so yes im gonna
walk the streets
until i find her
reveal my true self
and then personally
invite her to the ball
unless of course it turns out
that shes got a couple bats
in the old belfry
in which case i will realize
that my feelings were incorrect
and
slowly back away
it is your belfry that has bats
i do not have a single bat
in my belfry
no there are multiple bats
in your belfry
i am the prince and i say
that your belfry
is the one with the bats
well im the princes

who can pay for everything
and then you will never
so much as have to hang
your wet undergarments again

farm boy is off the table
groans softly
no matter how toothsome
he may be and
and toothsome he is
ew what does that mean
its how old people
say poppin
ah
vivian you must always think
and act like this
some boys kiss me
some boys hug me
i think theyre okay

grunts
but they cant see the light

chuckles
whwhy
i mean youre in line
to be our future king
oh its a bad system
my only qualification being
that my dad was one
mm
its not that
i dont want to be king
when i was little
i remember watching my father
go off to war
and thinking how
brave he looked in his armor
and i wanted to be
just like him
and then as i got older
and my life became
more about
traditions and customs
and people always watching me
and telling me what to do
and never asking
what i want or how i feel
i know exactly what you mean
laughs
what
i just had
no idea
tonight would go like this
this is precisely
how i hoped tonight would go
youre the one
i pick you to be my princess

that youre not of royal birth
no thats not it
wwell get married

of your life as royalty
royalty what about my work

a very prescribed role in court
prescribed role in court

i know theres just
no one else in this world

you are the future king
and as king it is all about you
and your power

sighs

the catapult makers
quiet gwen

james i couldnt do it
i wouldve married the prince
you think the prince

scoffs
cuddly cute good at waving

mice squeaking

john

shushes
yelps
i never felt what i felt
last night before
i mean you guys
hes so handsome
oh yes he is incredibly handsome
absolutely
annoyingly handsome
the cheekbones
and he likes me for me
sounds like true love
to this mouse
youre right my friend
but if saying yes to him
means saying no to this
i cant do it
all right guys
i have to try and make a life
for myself by myself
because that is what i want
and queen tatiana is my chance
right
whos queen tatiana
knocking
vivian
cinderella are you down there
stepmother
dear god no
she scares me

knocking vivian hello
im waiting for my tea
cinderella
oh im coming down
squeaking
im sick
uhhuh
well you didnt miss much
at the ball
the prince was fixated
on some mystery girl
then she ran away like a twit
so now hes to marry
princess laura of northphalia
the day after next
sighs malvolia and narissa
they never stood a chance
and i was so foolish
to believe differently
a mother just gets carried away
i know ive been hard on you
its not fueled by spite
ive never shared this
with anyone before but
i used to play piano
taught myself
and i was good
i was really good
nothing made me happier
then one day
i was given the opportunity
to train at the finest
school of music
and i took it
chuckles softly
there i was
two children a loving husband
and i had the audacity
to want more
it was just a month one month
and yet when i returned
my husband well
he believed real wives
didnt act so frivolously
you may think me cruel
but the real cruelty would be
for me to allow you to think
that you can be
something you cant
gasps
mice squeaking
this shoe
it was you
cinderella
i dont know how you did
what you did last night
but the prince chose you
he loves you
marry him and all of
our problems will be solved
i cant i told him
i didnt want to marry him
tell him you were wrong
tell him tell him
its all you want
if not for yourself
thenthen do it for us
for your family
i can help our family
stepmother
i can provide for us
dont be so stupid
who taught you
to think that way
please cinderella dont
throw away this opportunity
go back to him
its too late
hes marrying someone else
its over
fine
then im taking you to thomas
and im giving you to him today
i would rather die
i dont care
this is life
its not fair
its not right
all that hope
and that pride
its a waste
its a lie
all you want is to breathe
little girls should run free
but your corsets too tight
and your heels are too high
this treasure you found
bury it
the only way out marry it
that shadow of doubt
carry it
carry it down
to your grave oh
the world doesnt need
another dream girl
the world doesnt need
another dream girl
youre too dumb
youre too young
full of heart
so naive
youre so blind
youre so green
youll give up
just like me oh
the wings are ornamental
they have no intention
of letting you fly
dont be sentimental
some legends are born
in the wrong time
this treasure you found
bury it
the only way out
marry it
that shadow of doubt
carry it
carry it down to your grave
bury it
marry it
carry it
carry it down to your grave
bury it marry it

plays complex melody
piano playing in distance
whimpers softly
stops playing
breathing heavily
voice trembling
the world doesnt need
another dream girl
grunts
leave us
you havent spoken to me
since last night
youre mad
because i yelled at you
scoffs
i hate to break it to you
but kings yell
please say something
youre making me
wildly uncomfortable
have you ever wondered
why robert makes
the process to marry
so difficult
because hes a spoiled child
who refuses to grow up simple
i believe its because of the
example set before him by us
a marriage without love
without respect
bea please
you know i love you
saying love and showing love
are two very different things
rowan
before you were king
i felt your love every day
you couldnt stand to be away
from me even for a moment
remember you used to appear
at my window
like a knight in shining armor
and youd serenade me
with your skullsplitting voice
we were young
things change
no you changed
the crown changed you
youre so worried
to look a fool
so obsessed with your
reputation with your legacy
well its only my lifes work
it causes me
a great deal of stress
do you think youre the only
person who feels stress
god try being your bloody wife
it is utterly exhausting to sit
next to you and just smile
as if i were nothing more
than a prop
my voice completely silenced
i mean what i wouldnt give
to say youre wrong
in front of the entire kingdom
bea
youre being unreasonable now
well if you say so
after all youre the king
cant be any other opinions
other than yours
do you know
theres never a guarantee
with a couple in our position
but we had love rowan
we had it
and now
roberts wiser than both of us
knocking
hello
im ready
you summoned me your highness
we cant have
a regular conversation
like a normal father and son
can we
no no
to satisfy your power trip
you have to sit there
on your slightly too tall
throne
youyou belittle me in your
deep voice
youryour king voice yes
normal voice
all because youre so insecure
with your legacy that you
have to control my every move
now i ask you
does that sound
like a strong leader to you
rowan
robert
i was wrong
i king rowan
am i doing the king voice
a little bit
you cant help yourself
go find the owner
of this glass slipper
and if shell take you back
then marry her
or dont
its your life son
whwhy the sudden
change of heart
well definitely
wasnt your mum
go on leave now
chuckling
be bold

cause my heart
is always racing
chasing pacing
round the room
living carefully is
something i dont wanna do
when i feel my fear
staring at me

i know who im gonna be
i know who im gonna be
the worlds half asleep
its gonna wake up and see
if its a million to one
im gonna be that one
and if its
a shot in the dark
im gonna be the sun
and i just cant
afford to be wrong
even when im afraid
youre gonna know my name
yeah youre gonna
know my name
and i can see her
now and then
the one i know
that i could be
yeah
i see her laughin
cause she knew
all along in her head
so when the light
is hard to see
shes telling me
if its a million to one
im gonna be that one
and if its
a shot in the dark
im gonna be the sun
and i i just cant
afford to be wrong
even when im afraid
youre gonna know my name
