cinderella 
yeah 
do you think i look pretty 
i think you look so pretty 
but

i feel pretty 
cool 
you have dirt on your face 
 malvolia laughing

i i just thought 
since the whole kingdom
will be there today 
i could find someone
who will maybe buy it 
 laughter 
to think that any girl 
let alone you 
would have the audacity
to engage
in matters of business 
it s insane 
i will not have you
embarrassing this household
with your blasphemy 
don t ever let me catch you
trying such nonsense again 
put the dress down 
yes  stepmother 
good 
now    shoulders back 
   grunts 
  no slouching 
and smile 
every girl is worth more
when she smiles 
 sighs 
 door closes 
what are you doing 
i am stewing in my own anger 
 softly  
oh  okay 
you turned down the daughter
of lord reginald 
i guess she wasn t the one 
she was 
i would ve had control
of all the territories
right up to the domain
of the sea monster 
well  perhaps you should marry
the sea monster  robert 
i would have to have
grandmother s ring resized 
 laughs 
you keep overlooking
his behavior 
  and he ll never grow out of it 
  stop 
he s gonna make a fine king 
is it me 
or is your throne
just a little bit taller
  than it was yesterday 
   sputtering sigh 
  i mean  it really looks   
  oh  don t be ridiculous 
  quite a bit 
  and even if it is 
i have every right
to make it taller 
i m king

if you need me 
i shall be in my chambers 
brushing my hair 
until it all falls out

robert   the roundabout players
present the king s idiot son  
 chuckles   ooh  do you think
we can still get tickets 
i m becoming a laughingstock 
i think you re overreacting 
well  why don t you ask
the roundabout players
if i m overreacting 
they are currently
in a dark windowless room
under the castle 
you can t leave actors alone
in a basement without attention 
they ll die 
when you marry 
you ll settle down 
you ll stop behaving
like my idiot son 
and the perception
of the people will be
that you take the crown
seriously 
  you can t control me 
   choir singing in distance 
oh  that s exactly
what i can do 
that s the perk
of being the king 
but i feel nothing
for these women 
it s crazy to think
i m actually gonna
fall in love with one of them 
kings marry for power 
  not for love 
   choir continues singing 
oh  well  it s perfect then
that mother came with
three castles
and a hundred horses 
or i suppose
i never would ve been born 
  silence 
   choir gasps 
don t talk about
what you don t understand  hmm

and just out of spite 
i ll give it all    the crown 
the palace 
everything    to your sister 
choir 
  bum bum bum  
leave us  gwen 
sorry 
i would be embarrassed
if i wasn t so bored
with my life 
but since i m here 
i would love to stay
and help sort out
this whole crown issue 
you ve been excused  gwen 
right 
but would this be a good time
for me to mention
how the kingdom could use
the power of the wind
  instead of burning filthy coal 
  go

but women love it 
good god  robert 
if a rich man ever lost a woman 
it was to a man who could dance 
why do i have to explain

regardless of wealth or stature 
marrying a commoner
is not at all what i meant 
father  please 
deep down 
you need me to be king 
what a black mark
it ll be on your name
if i don t continue the line 
so  what option
do you really have 
 loud clattering 
too subtle 
not subtle enough 
fine 
so it shall be 
don t even think about it  gwen 
you re literally
not even going to let me
have a seat at the table 
i don t make up the rules 
i m just the king 
right 
 birds chirping 
so you re just going to
wander about until you find her 
wearing that
ridiculous disguise 
it works  wilbur 
nobody recognizes me 
lucky for you 
ah  no  too much 
what  the the makeup 
  no  you look like a pirate 
  you look like a pirate 
unnecessary 
you know  i can t believe
that you re willing to sully
the dignity of the royal family
for some commoner 
wilbur  you sound old 
  i m just   
  just what 
she s she s beautiful 
she s witty  she s fearless 
i mean  holy hell  did you see
the way she talked to my father 
  so mouthy 
  and glorious 
i must know her 
so  yes  i m gonna
walk the streets
until i find her 
reveal my true self 
and then personally
invite her to the ball 
unless  of course  it turns out
that she s got a couple bats
in the old belfry 
in which case  i will realize
that my feelings were incorrect
and   
slowly back away 
it is your belfry that has bats 
i do not have a single bat
in my belfry 
no  there are multiple bats
in your belfry 
i am the prince  and i say
that your belfry
is the one with the bats 
well  i m the prince s
best friend 
and i say that yours
is one with the bats 
i m your best friend  right 
i have lots of friends 
of course you re my best friend 
yeah  thought so 
beautiful human 
 coughs  
bats 
look at that 
wow 
you know  it s a good thing
stepmother never
comes down here 
she does not approve of pets 
or charity 
or kindness of any sort  really 
and she d definitely
stop you from doing
whatever it is you re doing
right now  which is beautiful 
and only a little bit gross 
a little bit  it s revolting 
she needs to throw that out 
  i don t mind it 
  cinderella  all right 
wish me luck   sighs 
because life
outside this basement   
   starts right now 
girls  it shouldn t be so hard 
but it is 
work is always hard 
why are we doing
cinderella work 
because i want you to see what
you re in for if you don t marry
a man of means  like thomas 
thomas 
he s quite the catch 
too bad he hasn t
been back in days 
well  if it s not thomas 
then it will just have to be
some other man 
like him 
vivian 
 gasps  no 
no  no  no  no  no 
do not cast your eyes
on some farm boy 
in this life 
you must marry rich 
get yourself a man
who can pay for everything 
and then you will never
so much as have to hang
your wet undergarments again 
  i m a go see if he needs a wife 
  no 
farm boy is off the table 
 groans softly 
no matter how toothsome
he may be  and   
   and toothsome he is 
ew  what does that mean 
it s how old people
say  poppin   
  ah 
  vivian  you must always think
and act like this 
  some boys kiss me 
some boys hug me  
  i think they re okay  
  if they don t give me
proper credit  
  i just walk away  
    they can beg  
   grunts 
    and they can plead  
   grunts 
  but they can t see the light  
  that s right  
   cause the boy
with the cold  hard cash  
  is always mr  right  
 grunts 
   cause we are living
in a material world  
  and i am a material girl  
  you know that we are living  
    in a material world  
   gasps 
  and i am a material girl  
but what about romance 
oh  please 
listen up 
  some boys romance  
  some boys slow dance  
  that s all right with me  
  if they can t
raise my interest  
    then i have to let them be  
   gasps 
    some boys try

us ladies give birth 
we run households 
surely we can run a business 
can t be that hard 
i mean 
wouldn t it just be great
if i could have my own shop 
right here 
i could hang my garments
on that side 
and i d say things like 
 thank you  come again

i m just trying to do my part
to correct a flawed system 
what s your price 
i mean  the brooch alone   
oh  the brooch 
that was my mother s 
i never knew her 
but i want to believe
she d rather me have my dreams

by its cover  milady 
   ey   
  yeah  uh

  in two weeks hence 
there ll be a ball  
  and not just any ball  this
night could change your life  
  see  it s time the prince
finally find his wife  
  that s right 
all the single ladies

  because every single one
to the ball is invited  
   so take a bath 
do your hair    aw 
  buy a fancy new dress 
paint your nails

  as prince robert  
  chooses his bride   
 laughs 
prince robert needs a ball
to find his bride 
 laughs  
what is wrong with him 
maybe nothing s wrong with him 
i heard he just wants to allow
anyone the chance
to fall in love with him 
how conceited is that 
rumors must be true 
what  pray tell  are the rumors 
you know  that he serves
no real function
other than to wreck things 
that the real brains
of the family is princess gwen 
duh 
oh  and that he s a mama s boy
who i heard  from time to time 
still gets spanked
on the tush tush 
  not true at all  though 
  ah  maybe 
sounds like a vicious lie to me 
so does this mean
you re not coming to the ball 
no way 
i mean  the whole thing
is weird and antiquated 
not my thing 
nice to meet you 
you know  we live in
a very old fashioned kingdom 
but the ball  i mean 
there ll be guests there
from all over the world 
open minded people
with cash to spare 
now  i know them 
i can introduce you
if you d like 
why would you do that 
i mean  you just met me 
let s just say
i know what it feels like
to not quite fit into the crate
you were born into 
and i    i believe in you 
then  yes 
i ll go 
 stammers  huzzah 
what 
 stammers 
i heard a proper person say that
one time when he was excited 
ah  look who s been around
a proper person 
just once 
i once shared an apple
with a goat named king rowan 
well  i m sure the prince
will definitely pick you 
i doubt it  i m dirty 
i smell like a basement

   music pauses 
    tonight  
   music resumes 
would you care to talk
alone somewhere 
lead the way 
 guests murmuring 
   horse sputters 
  what s it like being a crate 
like  this has got to be
a step up  right 
  robert  so this is the fountain 
  cinderella  ooh 
robert  do you have
a fountain where you live 
cinderella 
um  i don t

oh  my god   chuckles 
are you gonna play something
on the piano just for me 
 playing gentle music 
oh  my god  you are 
 playing ascending notes 
 music ends 
wow 
you re so full
of hidden talents 
so it sounds like you might
disagree with those who say
i  serve no real purpose
other than to wreck things  
just so you know 
i don t actually think
those things about you 
especially now 
 both chuckle 
well  you should 
 chuckles  
wh why 
i mean  you re in line
to be our future king 
oh  it s a bad system 
my only qualification being
  that my dad was one 
  mm 
it s not that
i don t want to be king 
when i was little 
i remember watching my father
go off to war
and thinking how   
brave he looked in his armor 
and i wanted to be
just like him 
and then  as i got older
and my life became
more about
traditions and customs
and people always watching me
and telling me what to do   
   and never asking
what i want or how i feel   
i know exactly what you mean 
 laughs 
what 
i just had   
no idea
tonight would go like this 
this is precisely
how i hoped tonight would go 
you re the one 
i pick you to be my princess 
what s wrong 
i i assure you
it doesn t matter to me
that you re not of royal birth 
no  that s not it 
w we ll get married 
okay  we ll we ll get married
and you will live the rest
of your life as royalty 
royalty  what about my work 
m my dresses can   
well  that would
most likely be frowned upon 
women have
a very prescribed role in court 
   prescribed role in court  
  but i would make sure
that you were dressed by
the finest dressmakers
  in all the land 
  i m a dressmaker 
i know  there s just
no one else in this world
i d rather be with than you 
robert  stop 
i don t want a life stuck
waving from a royal box
any more than a life
confined to a basement 
i have dreams
that i have to chase 
so if it s a choice   
   i choose me 
i understand 
really  i    i do 
 inhales 
  i found a love  
 playing  perfect  
  i found a boy  
 whispers  
i m sorry 
 bell tolls

 screams 
 groaning 
 mice squeaking 
 squeaking continues 
 chuckles 
 sighs 
mm  mm  mm  mm 
all the townspeople s
tax dollars
wasted on a ball  and for what 
for you to make
a complete fool out of me 
to teach me a lesson 
i m sorry  father 
you are single handedly
destroying my legacy 
i know you might not
understand this 
but the woman i chose
didn t choose me 
oh  i m sorry  darling 
aw 
have you lost your mind  
you are the future king 
and as king  it is all about you
and your power 
there are no other opinions 
none 
is this a good time to ask
why we are spending money
on catapults
  when we have so many already 
   sighs 
it really just benefits
the catapult makers 
quiet  gwen 
i really think we just need
to get some sleep 
no one asked you  beatrice 
 sighs 
your time is up  robert 
you will marry princess laura
by week s end 
i don t care
if you don t love each other 
so says the king 
if the crown demands it   
milord 
darling 
 door bangs shut 
what 
did you really just say
you don t care
if they love each other 
yeah  i want the sea monster 
what  bea bea beatrice 
don t be   
ay    ay  ay  ay 
  your highness 
  yes 
  where d you find that 
  it s the girl s 
she threw it at my head 
i m lucky to be alive 
look at our girl 
been up all night working 
  she s betting on herself 
  james  i couldn t do it 
i would ve married the prince 
you think the prince
would ve picked you 
 scoffs 
cuddly  cute  good at waving 
i mean  come on 
 mice squeaking 
i can hear you 
i bet you re arguing about why
i didn t just say yes
to marrying robert 
especially since i m maybe
in love with him 
john 
love  it was one night 
   shushes 
   yelps 
i never felt what i felt
last night before 
i mean  you guys 
he s so handsome 
  oh  yes  he is incredibly handsome 
  absolutely 
  annoyingly handsome 
  the cheekbones 
and he likes me for me 
sounds like true love
to this mouse 
you re right  my friend 
but if saying yes to him
means saying no to this   
   i can t do it 
all right  guys 
i have to try and make a life
for myself  by myself 
because that is what i want 
and queen tatiana is my chance 
right 
  who s queen tatiana 
   knocking 
vivian 
cinderella  are you down there 
  stepmother 
  dear god  no 
  she scares me 
  me  too 
  knocking   vivian  hello 
i m waiting for my tea 
cinderella 
oh  i m coming down 
 squeaking 
i m sick 
uh huh 
well  you didn t miss much
at the ball 
the prince was fixated
on some mystery girl 
then she ran away like a twit 
so now he s to marry
princess laura of northphalia
the day after next 
 sighs  malvolia and narissa 
they never stood a chance 
and i was so foolish
to believe differently 
a mother just gets carried away 
i know i ve been hard on you 
it s not fueled by spite 
i ve never shared this
with anyone before  but   
i used to play piano 
taught myself 
and i was good 
i was really good 
nothing made me happier 
then one day 
i was given the opportunity
to train at the finest
school of music 
and i took it 
 chuckles softly 
there i was   
two children  a loving husband 
and i had the audacity
to want more 
it was just a month    one month 
and yet  when i returned 
my husband  well   
   he believed real wives
didn t act so frivolously 
you may think me cruel 
but the real cruelty would be
for me to allow you to think
that you can be
something you can t 
 gasps 
 mice squeaking 
this shoe 
it was you 
cinderella 
i don t know how you did
what you did last night 
but the prince chose you 
he loves you 
marry him  and all of
our problems will be solved 
i can t  i told him
i didn t want to marry him 
tell him you were wrong 
tell him    tell him
it s all you want 
if not for yourself 
then then do it for us 
for your family 
i can help our family 
stepmother 
i can provide for us 
don t be so stupid 
who taught you
to think that way 
please  cinderella  don t
throw away this opportunity 
go back to him 
it s too late 
he s marrying someone else 
it s over 
fine 
then i m taking you to thomas 
and i m giving you to him today 
i would rather die 
  i don t care  
  this is life  
  it s not fair  
  it s not right  
  all that hope  
  and that pride  
  it s a waste  
  it s a lie  
  all you want is to breathe  
  little girls should run free  
  but your corset s too tight  
  and your heels are too high  
  this treasure you found 
bury it  
  the only way out  marry it  
  that shadow of doubt 
carry it  
  carry it down
to your grave  oh  
  the world doesn t need  
  another dream girl  
  the world doesn t need  
  another dream girl  
  you re too dumb  
  you re too young  
  full of heart  
  so naive  
  you re so blind  
  you re so green  
  you ll give up  
  just like me  oh  
  the wings are ornamental  
  they have no intention
of letting you fly  
  don t be sentimental  
  some legends are born
in the wrong time  
    this treasure you found  
    bury it  
    the only way out  
    marry it  
    that shadow of doubt  
    carry it  
  carry it down to your grave  
  bury it  
  marry it  
  carry it  
  carry it down to your grave  
    bury it  marry it  
    your grave  
    your grave  
    carry it  oh

  your grave  your grave     
 plays complex melody 
 piano playing in distance 
 whimpers softly 
 stops playing 
 breathing heavily 
 voice trembling  
  the world doesn t need  
  another dream girl   
 grunts 
leave us 
you haven t spoken to me
since last night 
you re mad
because i yelled at you 
 scoffs 
i hate to break it to you 
but kings yell 
please  say something 
you re making me
wildly uncomfortable 
have you ever wondered
why robert makes
the process to marry
so difficult 
because he s a spoiled child
who refuses to grow up  simple 
i believe it s because of the
example set before him by us 
a marriage without love 
without respect 
bea  please 
you know i love you 
saying  love  and showing love
are two very different things 
rowan 
before you were king 
i felt your love every day 
you couldn t stand to be away
from me  even for a moment 
remember  you used to appear
at my window
like a knight in shining armor
and you d serenade me
with your skull splitting voice 
we were young 
things    change 
no  you changed 
the crown changed you 
you re so worried
to look a fool 
so obsessed with your
reputation  with your legacy 
well  it s only my life s work 
it causes me
a great deal of stress 
do you think you re the only
person who feels stress 
god  try being your bloody wife 
it is utterly exhausting to sit
next to you and just smile
as if i were nothing more
than a prop 
my voice completely silenced 
i mean  what i wouldn t give
to say   you re wrong  
in front of the entire kingdom 
bea   
you re being unreasonable now 
well  if you say so 
after all  you re the king 
can t be any other opinions
other than yours 
do you know 
there s never a guarantee
with a couple in our position 
but we had love  rowan 
we had it 
and now   
robert s wiser than both of us 
 knocking 
hello 
i m ready 
you summoned me  your highness 
we can t have
a regular conversation
like a normal father and son 
can we 
no  no 
to satisfy your power trip 
you have to sit there
on your slightly too tall
throne 
you you belittle me in your   
 deep voice  
your your king voice  yes 
 normal voice  
all because you re so insecure
with your legacy that you
have to control my every move 
now  i ask you 
does that sound
like a strong leader to you 
rowan 
robert   
i was wrong 
i  king rowan   
am i doing the king voice 
a little bit 
you can t help yourself 
go find the owner
of this glass slipper 
and if she ll take you back 
then marry her 
or don t 
it s your life  son 
wh why the sudden
change of heart 
well  definitely
wasn t your mum 
  go on  leave now 
   chuckling 
be bold 
 clicks tongue 
  hear ye  hear ye  hear ye  
  if you don t know yet 
you won t believe  
  what i m about to tell  
  but our handsome young prince
at the ball  
  well  he fell
for a pretty young lady  
  i hear quite the stunner 
who then turned out to be  
  uh huh  quite the runner 
see  at the end of the night  
  this woman split so fast 
she left no name  
  no i d  
just a shoe made of glass  
  and now he s looking
for the girl  
  with the other glass slipper 
no buckles  no laces  
    not even a zipper  
  rosemary    the shoe  
  the shoe 
does it look like this   
  that s a dirty old boot  lady 
swing and a miss  
  it s hard for me to tell 
could my foot be right   
  your foot s the size of
a canoe  ma am  way too tight  
  how unfortunate for me
that i birthed  
  ten sons     
 vocalizing 
  mm 
   crowd murmuring 
that is too bad 
but i like those vocal runs 
   ey   ey   ey  
  people  look  it ain t me
who needs convincing  
  i ain t the one
with the ring a ding ding  
  go home  get your girls
in the shoe that goes bling  
  and don t show it to me 
tell it to your future king   
not her 
worth a try 
 retches 
no 
i mean  don t they know
i m looking for her 
no 
nope  not her 
nope 
nope  no  no

 scoffs 
i mean  me  neither

  i can t 
i have to let her know
that it s possible between us 
it s a beautiful thing
how much you love her 
  you crying  hench 
  so what if i am 
would that we all have
what robert has 
i mean  what is life
if you re not with
the person you love 
right 
otherwise  we might as well
just close our eyes
and take the ol  mud nap 
because   
nothing else matters 
so we find her  then 
robert  where did you see her
the last time

that anything is possible

i m just really in a hurry

 song ends 
  million to one  remix  
by camila cabello playing 
  here i go again  
  i m imagining
a world outside  
  unlike the one i m in  
  daydreaming again  
  of when i ll get a chance  
  there s a world
that understands  
  where you don t hear
the whispers  
  in the room
you re walking in  
  daydreaming again  
  all i need is a chance  
  when i feel my fear
staring at me  
  i tell it just wait and see  
  i know who i m gonna be 
i know who i m gonna be  
  the world s half asleep  
  it s gonna wake up and see  
  if it s a million to one  
  i m gonna be that one  
  and if it s
a shot in the dark  
  i m gonna be the sun  
  and i just can t
afford to be wrong  
  even when i m afraid  
  you re gonna know my name  
  yeah  you re gonna
know my name  
  i can barely sleep  
   cause my heart
is always racing  
  chasing  pacing
round the room  
  living carefully is
something i don t wanna do  
  when i feel my fear
staring at me  
  i tell it just wait and see  
  i know who i m gonna be 
i know who i m gonna be  
  the world s half asleep  
  it s gonna wake up and see  
  if it s a million to one  
  i m gonna be that one  
  and if it s
a shot in the dark  
  i m gonna be the sun  
  and i just can t
afford to be wrong  
  even when i m afraid  
  you re gonna know my name  
  yeah  you re gonna
know my name  
  and i can see her
now and then  
  the one i know
that i could be  
  yeah  
  i see her laughin   
   cause she knew
all along in her head  
  so when the light
is hard to see  
  she s telling me  
  if it s a million to one  
  i m gonna be that one  
  and if it s
a shot in the dark  
  i m gonna be the sun  
  and i  i just can t
afford to be wrong  
  even when i m afraid  
  you re gonna know my name  
  you re gonna know
my name  
  you re gonna know my name  
  you re gonna know
my name  yeah  
  you re gonna know my name
