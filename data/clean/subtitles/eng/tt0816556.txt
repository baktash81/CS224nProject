bad has happened 
it hasn t reached me yet 
but it s on its way 
jason 
i don t know why it s important 
it s like how it helps people 
like  dealing with her loss 
like making up stories
about ghosts or whatever 
kim  alice kept secrets 
she kept the fact she
kept secrets a secret 
june  it s hard for some
people to understand 
but you have to believe
you re to blame
or else there s nothing
to hold on to 
 static crackling 
man over phone 
police and emergency service 
june on phone  my daughter  alice 
has gone missing  we need some   
how long ago did you last   
she was in the dam   
looked everywhere 
 static crackling 
do you know where you are 
we re on the other side of the dam 
she s been missing for quite a few   
okay 
please send someone now 
i need you to talk
to me for a second 
 crying 
we don t know where she is 
hello  june  can you hear me 
richard brooks on tv 
the normally tranquil setting
of ararat s norval dam
was shattered yesterday
with the disappearance
of 16 year old alice palmer
while picnicking with her family 
we received a call around 6 00 p m 
tonight of a missing girl 
and on discovering the
nature of the situation
we called in the search and rescue
divers from melbourne 
police divers entered the water
around 10 00 with ses volunteers
joining a fruitless search   
russell  matt and ali had swum
out to the middle of the dam 
i could see them from where i
was sitting at the picnic area 
matthew  i think we d been in the
water for about 15 minutes 
and i said that i was gonna get out 
it was cold 
so  i started swimming back and
she didn t come out with me 
so i thought she s
gonna stay in there 
i remember matty got out 
and a few minutes later 
i heard him ask where was alice 
so  i stood up and looked
out across the dam 
and the water was completely still 
so i called out 
june  i looked out over the water
to see if i could see her 
and both the boys
had kind of checked 
you know  the bush land behind 
i could see alice s towel 
she d left it on the ground 
and she clearly hadn t
got out of the water
because then  you know  she would
have picked up her towel  so   
yeah  that was the last
time that i saw her 
 indistinct chatter 
 laughs 
brooks  police continue to hold grave
fears for 16 year old alice palmer
who disappeared while
picnicking with her family 
police search and rescue divers   
russell  we were told to go home 
and if the search and rescue
divers found anything
then they d let us
know immediately 
june  it felt very strange
in the car on the way home
because there was one empty seat 
one minute she was
there and then gone 
georgie  i went back to stay
with the palmers that night 
we were just mostly waiting 
mostly waiting for news 
for bad news 
there was that expectation 
we got a call from russell on
his mobile about 9 00 at night 
and he said there d been
an accident at the weir 
and alice had gone missing 
so  we thought that
we better go to ararat 
i remember june was a bit
funny about seeing iris 
there was a strange
feeling between them 
it felt a little strange
having my mother there 
mum and i  there for alice 
just didn t feel like the
right order of things 
iris  it was an awful  awful night 
worst night of our lives 
mmm hmm 
june  i went into alice s
room later that night
and her phone went off a couple
of times  but i didn t answer it 
i remember  the bed was made 
i remember thinking
how neat everything looked 
jason  i got a call from
alice s mum  june 
she d said that alice is missing
and presumed  like  she drowned
and i didn t not
believe her 
but  i don t know  it was
kind of hard to take 
so i actually called
alice s mobile 
i just   
maybe wanted to see if   
hope it was a joke or
something  i don t know 
it was just a real shock 
just didn t really
feel like it was real 
everything was the same as always 
but people were saying
alice had drowned 
interviewer  are there any memories from
that night that stand out for you 
i remember we had
the porch light on 
still do  actually  just in case 
and why is that 
just in case she
comes home  i guess 
 inaudible 
man  all right  get in 
sandy  the ses divers located alice s
body at approximately 9 25 p m 
they used sonar to locate her 
and she d drifted some way
and come to rest on a shelf at the bottom
of the storm water system in the dam 
obviously contacted
the family immediately 
russell  as soon as we were told
that they d found the body 
june and i went down to the dam 
georgie d come over
to keep matt company 
it was all very
official and formal 
and they asked me
to sign a statement
of identification 
june stayed in the car 
and  you know  on reflection 
i think that was a mistake
because she didn t
have any closure 
june  i just couldn t bring myself
to identify alice s body 
she d been underwater
all that time and it   
i guess it s not how i   
i didn t want to remember
her in that way 
i thought that was my responsibility
as ali s dad  you know 
that s what a father does 
russell  the car stalled on the
way back from the dam 
but the only gear i could
get it into was reverse 
so  we drove back
into town in reverse 
which was either that or walk 
and given everything
that had happened 
seemed like the better
option  really 
iris  the autopsy was performed
on the monday  the 27th 
then the coroner released the
body on tuesday  the 28th 
it was very strange spending christmas
day with the family up there
while alice lay
alone in the morgue 
i don t know  it was just like i hadn t
seen her for a week or anything  like   
yeah  it didn t feel real 
june 
death takes everything eventually 
it s the meanest  dumbest machine
there is  and it just keeps coming
and it doesn t care 
there s nothing else
to know about it  really 
it was a somber day for the family
and friends of alice palmer
who gathered to pay their final respects
to a young woman taken too soon 
she was a great person 
very popular  clever  lovely 
she was   
i don t    yeah 
trudeau 
alice is remembered as a happy 
fun loving girl
with a zest for life 
described as always
putting others   
georgie  the palmers were really
doing it tough at that time 
and when i think of
how bad it was back then 
it s hard to imagine how
much worse they would get 
russell  ten days after ali s funeral 
so that makes it the 15th of january 
stuff started happening around the
house  noises in the roof 
and sounds coming
from outside the window
and other movements that seemed
to come from ali s old room 
so  we re hung the door
to ali s room 
and we got a pest controller to
come in and check for termites 
but it didn t help at all 
the door kept slamming and we still
kept getting the noises from her room 
georgie  there was just something
weird about that house 
it had a really strange
feeling about it 
i really can t explain to you
what it was exactly 
but you d go in there
and just have this bad
feeling  like  in your gut 
june 
i started having these nightmares 
and they were so distressing
that sometimes i just wouldn t
want to open my eyes 
i d woken up  but i didn t
want to open my eyes 
there was one particular one  it
was quite vivid and recurring 
alice would come down the hall
still dripping from the dam
and just stand at the foot of
our bed  just staring at us 
it was quite terrifying  as i said 
i didn t want to open my eyes 
by early february my
nightmares were getting so bad
that i began to go
for walks at night 
sometimes for hours at a time 
just so that i didn t have
to go to bed at night
and close my eyes and go to sleep 
sometimes i would actually
go into people s houses 
i didn t feel like i was
doing anything wrong 
i guess i really just wanted to be
inside someone else s life for a while 
interviewer  georgie  do you remember
how russell was doing at that time 
yeah  russell was   
he was working a lot at that point 
i think that might have
helped him with his grief 
send it through
without any explanation 
frederik  russell and i met
actually on the gippsland
catchment project in  98
and worked together on that 
interviewer  so  you guys have known
each other for a few years 
yeah  a good few years  yeah 
do you remember how he was
affected after alice s death 
what changed 
it was work as normal  and
that was troubling actually 
i didn t really know what
to say to him about that 
you never spoke about it 
not really 
everyone grieves in their own way 
and it wasn t really my place
to be telling him how to feel 
but i certainly   
i certainly was concerned 
russell  i was really grateful
that i had my work 
and  i mean  i felt really
guilty about that at the time 
but  you know  i just
wanted to get on with it 
then one night  in late february 
i came home from work  and i
was sitting in the kitchen
and i heard a noise
coming from ali s room 
so  i went into ali s room 
and i don t really know why 
but i sort of found
myself sitting down
in the chair in front
of the dresser 
and before i could kind of work
out what i was doing there 
ali walked in and she
went over to her desk
and started sharpening a pencil 
and then she looked like she was checking
for a text message on her phone 
and  you know  i was
completely freaked out 
she was completely
oblivious to my presence 
and then i don t know what happened 
i must have moved the bed
or  you know  squeaked
my shoes or something 
but she went completely rigid 
and i knew then that
she knew i was there 
and she slowly turned around and she
looked me right in the eye fully for 
you know  what felt like forever 
and then she just came at me and stood
up and said   get out  get out  
and i just got up and went
out as fast as i could 
i could hear russell crying 
and he was here in the kitchen 
mathew and i both
found him in here 
and he was sobbing 
he was absolutely inconsolable 
interviewer  do you believe russell
when he says he saw a ghost 
yeah  i do 
i believe he saw what he saw 
and he wouldn t    he s not the
kind of man to make something up 
so  i believe he saw something 
whether it s a real ghost
or not  i don t really know 
but i m sure he saw something 
georgie  i remember trying to
talk to members of the church
about how to help june
and how to help the palmers 
but there just didn t seem like
there was anything we could do 
i think part of the reason was
because they weren t churchgoers 
so  didn t know how to
offer them comfort 
i don t even know
what june believes in 
i found myself mostly
concerned about mathew 
i guess because those two
were always so close 
i was worried how he would cope 
i remember he was spending
a lot more time alone 
we were all worried about him 
mathew came in with some
unusual bruises on his body 
they were unusual in terms of
their distribution and depth 
we obviously took a history 
trying to exclude trauma 
but there was certainly no history of
trauma that he was able to give us 
we tested him for vasculitis 
and we also excluded any poisoning
or toxins in his system 
we were unable to turn
up anything conclusive 
and several weeks after this  the
bruises just resolved spontaneously 
and we were never able to really
establish a cause for them 
my name s steve wilkie 
i m mathew s best friend 
i usually stay at mathew s house
two or three times a week 
we started a band together  so  we
normally play music at my house 
mathew seems a bit quieter  but
he was always pretty quiet 
so  i guess there wasn t really any
warning bells going off or anything 
well  i had heard about june
going into people s houses 
and mathew never really seemed to
want to talk about any of that 
i never asked him about any of it 
leith  i know that he was always
interested in photography 
and he was   
at this time  he was starting
to pursue it with more passion 
clive  mathew came to me 
he was very keen
to find out anything
about photography 
so  i was more than willing to
help out  that s what i do 
so  he was picking my brains about
just about anything to do with it 
from equipment  down to techniques 
down to lighting  you know 
but he was a great asset  so 
i mean  eventually i employed him 
interviewer  mathew  can you talk to
me about the photographs
of the backyard that
you ve been taking 
yeah  basically i ve
taken that same photo
with that composition for  i think  every
three months for the past four years 
and it s just a photograph
of the backyard 
looking out  you can see
the hills in the distance 
it s just like a little project
that i set up for myself
when we got here 
interviewer  and what was in the april
28th photograph that was different 
well  it s basically the same shot 
but it would appear that alice
is standing against the fence 
do you remember what the reaction
in the house was at the time 
i wouldn t say the mood was good 
but it was better than before 
it was like    like it gave us sort
of something to focus on  i think 
all of us 
bob  the photographs were
taken on the 3rd of april 
and they were developed on the 4th  and
i looked at them  i think on the 5th 
and looked at the dams and the water
levels and i was quite happy 
but it was only the following night that
it was pointed out to me by my wife
that there was something
in the background
in norval dam  this image came up 
june  when i first looked
at the photograph 
i didn t know what to make of it 
the image was quite unsettling
because it certainly
looked like alice 
it was an incredibly
discomforting image 
and i became convinced
that alice was still alive 
russell  i didn t have any rational
explanation for who was in those photos 
but i did know something
about alice that june didn t 
i d seen alice s body 
i didn t think she was alive 
i knew she wasn t 
i became convinced that
russell had made a mistake 
he himself said that it didn t
look like anybody anymore 
june was so convinced
that i d made a mistake
that i actually started
to have doubts myself 
i started to think maybe
i d made my mind up
that it was alice s
body before i d looked 
and that the circumstances
were so compelling for me 
that i d decided that it was her 
more than three months after the funeral
of ararat teenager alice palmer 
her grieving parents
formally requested
her body be exhumed
from the general cemetery 
there has been some contention
from the palmer family
about the accuracy of the
original body identification 
june and russell palmer were adamant
that dna testing be carried out 
they just couldn t be sure
that the body they identified
was indeed alice 
trudeau  and today  almost   
russell  alice s body was exhumed
in the presence of the funeral
director  dr  slatter 
and there was a representative
from the coroner s office also 
and it was then transported
to ararat base hospital
where they took the dna samples 
and she stayed there until
the results came back 
june 
a few days later we received a copy
of the coroner s
preliminary report 
and alice s identity was confirmed
by the dna sample match 
russell  it was only after they d
confirmed that it was alice s body
that i realized how much
that i d invested
in the possibility
of it not being her 
you know  i can t tell you how
much i wanted there to have been
a terrible mistake 
even if it had been mine 
really  really wanted there to have
been somebody else s kid in that dam 
a runaway  a murder victim 
just anybody else s  just as
long as it wasn t my kid 
just as long as it wasn t alice 
yes  it is 
 laughing 
stop it 
 laughing 
 dog barking 
 people chattering 
 people clapping 
 all laughing 
oh  my god 
 screaming 
june  alice was reburied two
days later  on the 7th of june 
but the question remained  who
or what was in those photos 
well  i continued
to hear things  and   
interviewer  what did you hear 
i was hearing noises  sort of   
they didn t really relent  i kept
hearing noises in the hallway 
so  i thought   well 
i ll just set up a camera
 to see if i see anything 
see something  
the first night i looked back and
there was footage of a figure
moving from the lounge room across
the hallway to the front door 
helen over radio 
you re on voice fm  8 02 
i m helen bath
and we re taking calls
with psychic consultant 
ray kemeney 
next we have nadia
on the line  ray 
ray  hi  nadia  how are you 
what can i do for you 
nadia  my question is about career  and
i ve also got a question about family 
june  it was around about
that time i decided
to seek out the advice
of ray kemeney 
i had heard ray on the
radio over the years 
and opinion was quite divided 
some thought he was the real deal 
others were unconvinced 
helen 
next we have annie on the line 
ray  hi  annie  how are you 
annie  i m fine  thanks  ray 
thank you for taking my call 
my pleasure 
what can i do for you 
i just wanted a general reading 
general not just medical 
ray  i m hungarian by birth 
my parents came out here
when i was quite young 
i ve got a 15 year old daughter who lives
with her mother in south australia 
my christian name is actually
schultz  but i changed it to ray 
i think it s a more trustworthy
name for a psychic 
australia s wog psychic of choice 
most of what i do is   
when i m dealing with
the sick or the dying 
which i guess probably fits
about a third of my clients 
is to allow them the possibility
that death is not the bitter end 
that it s not the full stop 
which is a consolation that
i m quite happy to give them
considering the fact that what happens
after death is up for grabs anyway 
there s somebody very close to you 
someone you haven t
seen for a while 
someone who is going to
come back into your life 
someone who ll be of
great comfort to you 
anyone that fits that bill 
annie 
yeah  i can think of someone 
look  i won t lie to you  annie 
i can see obstacles ahead of you
but i think that this person
who is coming back to you
is gonna make a great difference
and will be of great solace to you 
 crying  thanks  ray 
see you  annie 
where i come from 
when someone dies 
they block out all the
mirrors in the house
to stop the dead from
finding their way back 
it s things like that 
that make a difference 
hi  annie  i m ray 
 whispering indistinctly 
 sniffling 
you re gonna die  annie 
it s just the start of
something else  all right 
thank you 
it s all right 
okay 
june  i liked ray immediately 
he wasn t what i expected 
i don t know what
i really did expect 
but there was nothing
kind of spooky
or fake about him 
 button beeps 
okay  are we ready 
mmm hmm 
i want you to close your eyes   
ray 
i usually video tape my sessions
so that they can be reviewed
later by the clients 
especially when there s elements
of trance or hypnotism involved 
i keep one copy for myself 
one copy for them 
better to be safe than sorry 
okay  so you re standing
outside your house 
tell me what you see 
my house 
june on tape  it s a white house 
i m walking towards the front door 
ray on tape  okay 
now  i want you to go
inside the house 
i want you to move
slowly through the house 
i want you to describe
what you see 
where you are  just
give me a guided tour 
okay  i m walking down the hallway
towards alice s room 
what s there 
i can see alice s shoes
outside her room 
and what does that
mean for you  june 
she always used to leave her
sneakers outside her room 
so  i want you to go
inside her room now 
open the door and
just move inside 
you feel safe enough to
go into alice s room 
okay 
now open the door 
i m going inside her room 
you can see something  can t you 
tell me what you see  june 
she s   
alice is sitting in the wicker
chair at the end of her bed 
she looks sad 
russell  i first met ray when
june brought him home for dinner
the night of her
first consultation 
and  yeah  i m completely
indifferent to psychics 
i don t really have
a position on them at all 
i don t really want them to come
round for dinner  mind you 
but  you know  i didn t
want to upset june either 
he was a pleasant sort of a bloke 
he wasn t ooky spooky at all 
and i was on my best behavior 
a few days later 
maybe a week later 
i suggested to the family
that we hold a seance 
june was really keen  but i remember
russell just flat out refused 
i think mathew finally
talked his dad around 
interviewer  mathew  how did you feel
about having a seance held in your house 
at the time i was actually kind
of interested  sort of curious 
i don t think dad was
thrilled about the idea 
but  yeah  i thought
it would be interesting 
and i suggested we film it 
and i recorded it with
just our video camera 
which is the pc9 
i m getting a strong
presence in the room 
in the house 
june  i think we all thought that
the seance was a failure 
ray didn t really
come up with anything 
like  with any signs or anything 
so  after about an hour
or so  we called it quits 
and it wasn t until the next day
that mathew was
reviewing the footage
that there was an image of alice 
make your presence known to us 
russell  the new footage was completely
different to the hallway footage 
for one  it was significantly more
detailed  so it was less ambiguous 
and it was impossible to dismiss it
as a coincidence of shadow
play and digital noise 
there was something inexplicable in
our house  that was beyond doubt 
i was concerned  this was pretty
unfamiliar territory for me 
i ve never seen a ghost before 
russell 
ray got mathew to help him set up
three permanent cameras
inside the house
recording in time lapse
configurations 24 hours a day 
there d been a lot of speculation about
ray and what he was doing there 
i mean  when people don t know
that  of course  leads to a lot
of talk and a lot of speculation 
i had heard rumors throughout
july of video images
purporting to be of an
apparition in the house 
but i must say i was skeptical
as to their legitimacy 
interviewer  and your view on ray 
also very skeptical 
i think they had me as some
kind of rasputin figure
mesmerizing the palmers 
stealing their money 
doctoring the photos of alice 
 all singing 
mathew  in particular  seemed
to be really struggling 
i thought i might be able to help
this boy by being there  you know 
 blows 
russell  good one 
beautiful 
june  well done 
ray  that said  my chief
motivation was professional 
something was happening
inside that house
and i wanted to find
out what it was 
interviewer  what was your
reaction to these images 
russell  we were completely
gobsmacked by them 
but before we had time to  you
know  take in what that meant
the withers  video came out 
doug  go on 
is it good 
yeah  it s great 
can i have a look 
yeah  be careful 
june  cathy and doug withers were
at the dam on april the 3rd 
the same day that the bob
smeet photo was taken 
doug  be careful 
cathy 
what do you think i m going to do 
give it back 
be careful 
cathy  it s safe in my hands  babe 
 cathy exclaiming 
it was a couple of months
later  the end of july 
when we were looking at our footage
that we d shot down at the dam
and came across   
cathy  a figure in the background 
which we identified as bob smeet 
which interested us
 cause there s   
yeah  clearly  we didn t   
we sort of went 
 oh  it was the same
day he was there
 when he captured the image that
people have been talking about  
so  then we went
through all our footage
to see if we perhaps might have
captured that figure as well 
maybe the camera
had seen what bob saw 
yeah  yeah 
and we did find a figure
in the background
like the image that had been
described in his picture 
and then we looked more closely
and doug zoomed in on it 
yeah  i got right in
on the computer 
and from what  you know  could
have looked like a female figure
from a long way away 
up close and tight 
you could see that it definitely
was neither female nor alice 
it was mathew 
interviewer  do you guys believe in ghosts 
 laughing  no 
no  no 
 laughs  no 
matthew  well  this is where i was
when the bob smeet photo was taken 
i was wearing alice s jacket  and i
looked up and i saw a man on the hill 
who turned out to be bob smeet 
and i didn t wanna be in a photo 
so  i walked off through the bush 
what i didn t see was there was
also a couple over there filming 
who turned out to be the withers 
when the withers  thing
came out  dad came to me
and asked me if i had been
involved in anything else 
and i didn t wanna lie
to him  so i told him 
and i explained to dad
that i was responsible
for the image of alice
in the hallway
and the bedroom  and that i created
the april 28th backyard photo
and the seance image 
i just told him what i d done 
okay  so   
i got two photos  a photo
of alice and the backyard
and composited the images 
that s a photo
that i took of alice 
mum kept talking about   
she was always talking
about getting alice exhumed 
and she was really
keen on this idea
that dad had
misidentified her body 
and so i knew that without more
evidence it wasn t going to happen 
so i made the photograph 
i just used an old video of alice
and i played that on the tv 
i had the tv up on the book case
and it was as simple
as rotating the mirror
so that the reflection
of the tv came up in it 
and obviously the
mirror s quite small 
so it cropped out the
edges of the television
and then  yeah  i just filmed that 
same with the kitchen
and the bedroom 
what you see basically is alice
on the television in the mirror 
like  it wasn t about
trying to trick people 
i guess it was like something
was better than nothing 
interviewer  do you think that what you
did ultimately made it worse for june 
i think that   
yeah  yeah  i probably did
make it harder for her 
but  i mean  that
wasn t my intention 
i m not quite so sure
about his reasons 
i don t know that i
totally   
i don t want to say i don t
totally believe what he said 
but i m just not convinced
that he really knows why he did it 
when it all came out  people
wanted to do stories and books
and women s magazines  the whole
lot just went pear shaped 
look  we just didn t
know how to handle it 
i mean  you know  we had to protect
matty  we had to protect ourselves 
we had to protect ali s memory 
and we just didn t
have any experience
of dealing with all this interest
in something that
was incredibly personal
that people wanted
to make incredibly public 
i mean  the palmers weren t
coping well at all at that point 
and things were very bad 
they were doing it tough 
russell  this was like the
end of hope for all of us 
but especially for june 
she just really wasn t
ready to let ali go 
she just needed to hang on
to her a little bit longer 
and i don t think she would admit
it  but she was devastated 
frederik 
she s an interesting girl 
she seemed to not get
on with june so well 
i thought they actually
were quite alike 
it was interesting that the two
of them might not get on so well 
 indistinct chattering 
georgie 
they always seemed very much alike
and you could see that alice
took a lot after june 
but  also  other things had become
clear as well after alice s death 
that perhaps a bit of the
sense of the private
that they both shared 
thanks for that 
 chuckling 
june was    well  still is   
she keeps to herself a lot 
and it became clear that that
was happening with alice  too 
they had the sense of privacy 
the sense that there is
their own private life
that they will either choose to
share or to not share  i guess 
iris  it s wonderful when
your children come
and that new expression
that you have 
but as a mother  you ve
still always got doubts
that you re not doing enough or
you re not doing the right thing 
i partly blame myself 
that s come from me 
maybe it came from my mother 
i ve never been able to   
i ve never been able to give
myself over wholly to   
to june 
i feel june is a little
like that  too 
that she couldn t give
herself wholly to alice 
june  i hope that alice did know
how much i loved her 
i guess i held something back
a little as she grew older 
that would be the saddest thing 
to think she might not know 
ray suggested that
mathew accompany him
on one of his country
victorian tours 
where he was doing consultations 
and mathew jumped at the chance 
breakfast 
your shout  i think 
matthew 
no  i think it s your shout 
matthew  i think i realized when i
was away how much i missed alice
and that i was never going to
be able to speak to her again 
i guess that s something that
all of ray s clients
are coming to terms with 
you know  they want
to talk to someone
or make contact with
someone they ve lost 
and so did i 
so  i was sort of one of ray s
clients in a way as well 
matthew  no 
can i chuck it at you 
no 
let s see what happens 
well  what do you
think is gonna happen 
it s gonna hit me and
then i m gonna get angry 
that s what s gonna happen  no 
june  watch yourself 
what are you doing in my room 
matthew  i don t know 
 matthew chuckling 
get out 
matthew  when me and
ray went on the tour 
we left the two rented cameras
where they were  in the hallway 
i was sure there was still
something in the house 
and obviously   cause we were
away for the three days 
you know  we couldn t change
the tapes or anything 
so  we knew we were probably gonna get
about  like  a day and a half of footage 
but we left them running
and got back on august 22nd 
at which point
we checked the tapes 
june  only russell and
i were in the house
when these images were recorded 
mathew couldn t have had
anything to do with them 
they seemed to prove that there
was a ghost in our house 
alice s ghost 
interviewer 
do you believe in ghosts 
didn t used to 
but it s a hard thing
to prove or disprove 
i think   
yeah  sometimes i think
maybe they do exist 
there are ghosts everywhere 
it s a scary world 
i don t know why it s important 
it s like how it helps people 
like  dealing with her loss 
like making up stories
about ghosts or whatever 
june  it threw a question
mark over everything 
i went back and reviewed all the
footage that had come before 
all the material taken inside the
house following alice s death 
it was while i was looking at mathew s
june 13th hallway material again 
that i noticed
something in the image 
there was a second figure 
not mathew in the hallway
but someone else 
squatting in the dark
in alice s room 
at first i thought it was alice 
then i realized it was our
neighbor  brett toohey 
what was this man doing in my
house  in my daughter s room
more than six months
after her death 
when i found alice s safe  i realized
exactly why he d been there 
he was looking for the tape 
that s it 
 chattering indistinctly 
but it was such a   
it wasn t a very nice day 
yes 
you did a smoke ring 
yes 
brett on tape  you two getting nice
and cozy without me 
 girls giggling on tape 
june  alice began babysitting
for the tooheys in 2002 
and she continued for the
next two and a half years 
the tooheys  two boys were
five and nine years old 
i literally just couldn t
believe my eyes 
 moaning 
it just made me feel so sad 
 giggling 
russell  as far as i m concerned 
the tooheys were complicit
in ali s death 
i believe that if it hadn t been for
them  she would have reached out to us 
she wouldn t have felt guilty 
she wouldn t have felt the
burden of that secret 
she wouldn t have been isolated 
interviewer 
how do you feel towards brett now 
if he was around the corner 
i d probably throttle him 
he seemed like a nice guy 
you know  he was nice 
we d speak and he was never like 
you know  nasty or anything 
kylie  he had a pool at his
place and usually   
kate 
we used to swim there sometimes 
meredith  yeah  during the summer 
so  usually we just go to his
place and have a swim there 
 people chattering 
i was really bewildered
about  you know  what happened 
yeah 
it took a lot just to realize   
 cause  you know  i had no
idea that alice would   
no  be with
somebody  i know 
yeah  it was like
a complete surprise 
like  we just didn t think  you
know  she d do something like that 
yeah 
interviewer  why do you think
alice had the tape 
because she didn t
want them to have it 
interviewer  why is that 
she didn t trust them
anymore  i think 
russell  they must ve been really
desperate to get that tape 
from the moment that they d
heard of alice s death 
they would ve been living in this
constant fear of being found out 
i m glad he couldn t find it 
i m glad he knows it s not over 
sandy 
i had a lot of personal dealings
with the palmers during this time
as part of the investigating team
trying to locate brett and
marissa toohey and family 
and initially we were optimistic
that they would be found
and charges laid 
but  unfortunately  the leads
that we were working with
soon dried up  and so
the investigation stalled 
so  the police s advice to us was
that even if the tooheys were caught 
they would get off with
a suspended sentence
by claiming that the
sex was consensual 
which was  they claimed  you know 
supported by the video evidence 
interviewer  jason  did you know about
alice s involvement with brett 
no  no one did 
obviously i didn t 
we wouldn t be going out if i did 
it was    no 
i thought we were   
i thought we were pretty good 
june  it just left so many
unanswered questions 
why was she involved with him 
when did the relationship begin 
was she in love
with either of them 
i just don t know 
the tooheys sold their house and
moved  six months after alice died 
kim  alice kept secrets 
she kept the fact she
kept secrets a secret 
which does change the way that
you see somebody  i suppose 
when you realize that they did
hide things from you a bit 
i think i knew one alice and
maybe her mum knew another 
and there was another one again
that none of us knew maybe 
june  i found ray s business card
taped to alice s diary
on the page marked
12th of july  2005 
ray on tape 
why have you come to see me  alice 
alice on tape 
can you interpret dreams 
mmm hmm  sometimes 
how do you feel when you
wake up from these dreams 
they scare me a bit 
alice came to see me about
five months before she died 
i think she d heard me
on the radio a few times
and rang and made an appointment 
take a deep breath 
close your eyes 
i want you to imagine you re
standing outside your house 
when you can see that  you tell me 
okay 
 giggles  yeah 
all right  now  i want you
to go inside the front door 
go into the house  tell me
what you see  where you are 
interviewer  ray  why didn t you tell june
that you d actually met alice before 
okay  i m in the entrance   
ray  look  i don t think it was a
case of hiding something from them 
it was more that i was honoring
alice s request for confidentiality 
but it was damned if you do 
damned if you don t  you know 
the living room s
just directly ahead 
then you go to your right
and my room s in the back part of the
house as you go towards the kitchen 
do you see anything unusual 
anything different 
no 
no  we didn t feel like we
could trust ray anymore 
for whatever reasons he had of
keeping that information to himself 
it still felt like a betrayal 
ray  i wanted to help
june and the family
and i think they
wanted me to help them 
i wouldn t have been able
to do it if they d known 
there was a fair bit of resentment 
mathew wouldn t even speak to me 
but what i think really hurt
them more than anything
was what they saw as my failure
to see alice s eminent passing 
looking back  like 
it s kind of strange
that someone would  you know 
be as close to us as he was   
i think  maybe  he needed us
as much as we needed him 
ray  alice came to see me
because she was upset 
she was a very troubled person 
june   i had a dream last night 
 i was cold and wet 
i felt heavy  like i d been drugged 
 and when i woke up 
these sensations didn t go 
 i was feeling sick and confused
 and i was starting to get scared 
 voice trembling 
 i needed to see mum to talk to her 
 i stumbled to her room
 and as i stood there at
the bed  watching them 
 i was overcome by
this intense sadness 
 then the sadness turned to fear 
 i just stood there
paralyzed with fear
 and i realized there was nothing
that they could do for me anymore 
 i ve never felt so utterly alone 
 everything felt wrong  my body 
 the way things looked 
 then i realized that there
was something wrong with me 
 i started to cry  standing
there at the foot of the bed  
lake mungo is in southwestern
new south wales 
and that was the location of the
school camp that alice went on
from august the 2nd
to the 5th in 2005 
when she came home  she
said she d had a good time 
i do particularly remember it
because she came home
without her mobile phone 
which we d bought her
a month previously 
and her favorite
bracelet and watch 
yes  other than that  you know  she
didn t really talk about it too much 
 people screaming 
girl  wait  guys 
 people laughing 
jason  well  kim didn t show me till about
a year after she got back from camp
the stuff that she d taken
on her mobile phone 
interviewer 
so  why d you decide to tell june 
well  if we didn t tell june 
then it would be like
we were hiding something 
so  i don t know why   
i don t know why  but why not 
girl  smile for me 
smile 
they re a little
bit tipsy  that s all 
june  jason told us about
the phone footage
that the girls had
taken at lake mungo 
 girls laughing 
the other girls were
looking so happy
and she looked quite forlorn 
i was worried  i became convinced
that something had happened to her 
girl  so  just get a little bit 
just some of it 
june  kate s phone footage
was taken later that night
once the girls had spread
out over the lunettes 
girl  anywhere 
i think that we need
to get a photo 
girl 2  like africa 
like the desert 
june  there was an image of
alice  very hard to decipher 
in the bottom of the frame
kneeling under a tree 
it was only after viewing
the clip several times
that we realized
what she was doing 
she was burying something 
interviewer  i mean  did you know what
had happened that night with alice 
no 
i knew she d lost her phone 
i knew she was upset because
that was pretty obvious 
but i didn t know
why she was upset 
she didn t say that
she d seen anything 
she didn t really
say anything to me 
i didn t really  perhaps  take
it that seriously at the time 
you know  it was like context 
you know  we were
just having a good time
and i just thought
she d gotten a bit upset 
june  it started simply enough 
alice left the group
and started walking
off by herself 
but it was    obviously 
something was distressing her 
and we wanted to try and
find out what it was 
russell  we understood from the phone
video that she d buried something 
we had an idea where the tree was
because of what we could
see from the video 
we didn t really want to go
down during the day time
because  you know  we
didn t want to be digging 
you know  where tourists were 
so  we decided to go at night 
 indistinct whispering 
june and i started
digging and after a bit 
june said she d found something
and she pulled out a plastic bag 
and inside the plastic bag there
was ali s favorite necklace 
her ring  her watch 
her mobile phone 
her most precious things
buried out here on a school camp 
and we didn t know
why she did that 
i mean  we knew from the video
that she d buried something 
but we didn t know what it was 
russell  it s low on battery 
ray on tape 
are you scared of dying 
yeah  of course
i m scared of dying 
isn t everyone scared of dying 
would you like to tell me a little bit
about what happens in these dreams 
i feel like something bad
is gonna happen to me 
i feel like something
bad has happened 
it hasn t reached me yet 
but it s on its way 
and it s getting closer 
and i don t feel ready 
i feel like i can t do anything 
june  at some point 
this figure came towards her
from out of the darkness 
russell  i recognized the face as soon
as i saw it on the phone video 
it was the same face of the body
that i had identified at the dam 
it was ali s body and ali s face 
there is absolutely no
rational explanation
for what she saw on that phone 
 shouting indistinctively 
stay far away from me 
oh  my god  they re coming 
stay away 
 girls screaming 
june  i am convinced that alice
knew she was going to die 
i m convinced of that 
girl 
bundle up  bundle up  bundle up 
i think the figure at lake
mungo was an omen for her 
the burial of her
possessions was symbolic 
it was a ritual 
russell  no  i was never convinced
that ali believed she was gonna die 
you know  she had morbid thoughts 
sure  i mean  who doesn t 
and she had nightmares that upset
her  and enough to consult ray 
i don t know that anybody s
really convinced
that they re gonna die 
interviewer  and what about
the image at lake mungo 
how do you think alice
would have explained that 
how could she have explained it 
look  i think ali saw a ghost 
but she wasn t to know
that it was her own 
i believe she recorded a ghost 
i believe she recorded the
future coming to get her 
june  we had found out
about the tooheys 
ray  and what had
happened at lake mungo 
and by the time we returned home 
the house felt different  it was   
calm 
i think that alice wanted
us to know more about her 
she wanted us to know
who she really was 
before she   
you know  before she could leave 
 indistinct chatter 
in the weeks and months
after lake mungo 
we started to feel
like a family again 
it just crept up on us  really 
we were a little
battered and wobbly 
but we were a family all the same 
 all laughing 
hi  ray 
nice to see you  russell 
yeah  you too 
nice  come in 
june  ray called out of the blue
and said he was going to
be coming through town
and asked if it was all right if
he could come round and visit 
six months had gone by 
and i just felt that
under the circumstances 
i didn t think it
could do any harm 
russell  i think we all felt
that after mungo 
in our own ways  there d been
closure  i suppose  to a degree 
and  you know  for each
of us it s different 
and for each of us 
we ve made our own peace 
it seems strange to me that ali
should withdraw so abruptly 
and we didn t help her 
we didn t change anything 
i think we just collectively
made a decision to move forward 
and  you know  moving
was really a big part of all that   
deciding to move 
 people chattering 
 upbeat music playing on speaker 
june  it will be difficult
to leave the house 
sometimes  you know 
i just forget that   
she s not coming back 
i forget 
ray  okay 
close your eyes
and imagine that you re back
standing outside the house 
mmm hmm 
can you see it 
go inside the house 
i m going through the front door 
and   
walking down the hall
towards alice s room 
alice  someone s there 
i think someone s
coming down the hall 
june  door s open 
do you know who it is 
do you want to go inside 
yeah 
okay 
what do you see 
alice  it s my mum 
what s she saying 
she s not   
she s not saying anything 
i don t think she knows i m there 
alice isn t here 
she s not here 
what s happening  alice 
are you talking to her 
is she talking to you 
she s going now 
she s leaving the room 
she s gone 
open your eyes 
 sighs
