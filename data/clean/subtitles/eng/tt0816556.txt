bad has happened
it hasnt reached me yet
but its on its way
jason
i dont know why its important
its like how it helps people
like dealing with her loss
like making up stories
about ghosts or whatever
kim alice kept secrets
she kept the fact she
kept secrets a secret
june its hard for some
people to understand
but you have to believe
youre to blame
or else theres nothing
to hold on to
static crackling
man over phone
police and emergency service
june on phone my daughter alice
has gone missing we need some
how long ago did you last
she was in the dam
looked everywhere
static crackling
do you know where you are
were on the other side of the dam
shes been missing for quite a few
okay
please send someone now
i need you to talk
to me for a second
crying
we dont know where she is
hello june can you hear me
richard brooks on tv
the normally tranquil setting
of ararats norval dam
was shattered yesterday
with the disappearance
of 16yearold alice palmer
while picnicking with her family
we received a call around 600 pm
tonight of a missing girl
and on discovering the
nature of the situation
we called in the searchandrescue
divers from melbourne
police divers entered the water
around 1000 with ses volunteers
joining a fruitless search
russell matt and ali had swum
out to the middle of the dam
i could see them from where i
was sitting at the picnic area
matthew i think wed been in the
water for about 15 minutes
and i said that i was gonna get out
it was cold
so i started swimming back and
she didnt come out with me
so i thought shes
gonna stay in there
i remember matty got out
and a few minutes later
i heard him ask where was alice
so i stood up and looked
out across the dam
and the water was completely still
so i called out
june i looked out over the water
to see if i could see her
and both the boys
had kind of checked
you know the bush land behind
i could see alices towel
shed left it on the ground
and she clearly hadnt
got out of the water
because then you know she would
have picked up her towel so
yeah that was the last
time that i saw her
indistinct chatter
laughs
brooks police continue to hold grave
fears for 16yearold alice palmer
who disappeared while
picnicking with her family
police searchandrescue divers
russell we were told to go home
and if the searchandrescue
divers found anything
then theyd let us
know immediately
june it felt very strange
in the car on the way home
because there was one empty seat
one minute she was
there and then gone
georgie i went back to stay
with the palmers that night
we were just mostly waiting
mostly waiting for news
for bad news
there was that expectation
we got a call from russell on
his mobile about 900 at night
and he said thered been
an accident at the weir
and alice had gone missing
so we thought that
we better go to ararat
i remember june was a bit
funny about seeing iris
there was a strange
feeling between them
it felt a little strange
having my mother there
mum and i there for alice
just didnt feel like the
right order of things
iris it was an awful awful night
worst night of our lives
mmmhmm
june i went into alices
room later that night
and her phone went off a couple
of times but i didnt answer it
i remember the bed was made
i remember thinking
how neat everything looked
jason i got a call from
alices mum june
shed said that alice is missing
and presumed like she drowned
and i didnt not
believe her
but i dont know it was
kind of hard to take
so i actually called
alices mobile
i just
maybe wanted to see if
hope it was a joke or
something i dont know
it was just a real shock
just didnt really
feel like it was real
everything was the same as always
but people were saying
alice had drowned
interviewer are there any memories from
that night that stand out for you
i remember we had
the porch light on
still do actually just in case
and why is that
just in case she
comes home i guess
inaudible
man all right get in
sandy the ses divers located alices
body at approximately 925 pm
they used sonar to locate her
and shed drifted some way
and come to rest on a shelf at the bottom
of the storm water system in the dam
obviously contacted
the family immediately
russell as soon as we were told
that theyd found the body
june and i went down to the dam
georgied come over
to keep matt company
it was all very
official and formal
and they asked me
to sign a statement
of identification
june stayed in the car
and you know on reflection
i think that was a mistake
because she didnt
have any closure
june i just couldnt bring myself
to identify alices body
shed been underwater
all that time and it
i guess its not how i
i didnt want to remember
her in that way
i thought that was my responsibility
as alis dad you know
thats what a father does
russell the car stalled on the
way back from the dam
but the only gear i could
get it into was reverse
so we drove back
into town in reverse
which was either that or walk
and given everything
that had happened
seemed like the better
option really
iris the autopsy was performed
on the monday the 27th
then the coroner released the
body on tuesday the 28th
it was very strange spending christmas
day with the family up there
while alice lay
alone in the morgue
i dont know it was just like i hadnt
seen her for a week or anything like
yeah it didnt feel real
june
death takes everything eventually
its the meanest dumbest machine
there is and it just keeps coming
and it doesnt care
theres nothing else
to know about it really
it was a somber day for the family
and friends of alice palmer
who gathered to pay their final respects
to a young woman taken too soon
she was a great person
very popular clever lovely
she was
i dont yeah
trudeau
alice is remembered as a happy
funloving girl
with a zest for life
described as always
putting others
georgie the palmers were really
doing it tough at that time
and when i think of
how bad it was back then
its hard to imagine how
much worse they would get
russell ten days after alis funeral
so that makes it the 15th of january
stuff started happening around the
house noises in the roof
and sounds coming
from outside the window
and other movements that seemed
to come from alis old room
so we rehung the door
to alis room
and we got a pest controller to
come in and check for termites
but it didnt help at all
the door kept slamming and we still
kept getting the noises from her room
georgie there was just something
weird about that house
it had a really strange
feeling about it
i really cant explain to you
what it was exactly
but youd go in there
and just have this bad
feeling like in your gut
june
i started having these nightmares
and they were so distressing
that sometimes i just wouldnt
want to open my eyes
id woken up but i didnt
want to open my eyes
there was one particular one it
was quite vivid and recurring
alice would come down the hall
still dripping from the dam
and just stand at the foot of
our bed just staring at us
it was quite terrifying as i said
i didnt want to open my eyes
by early february my
nightmares were getting so bad
that i began to go
for walks at night
sometimes for hours at a time
just so that i didnt have
to go to bed at night
and close my eyes and go to sleep
sometimes i would actually
go into peoples houses
i didnt feel like i was
doing anything wrong
i guess i really just wanted to be
inside someone elses life for a while
interviewer georgie do you remember
how russell was doing at that time
yeah russell was
he was working a lot at that point
i think that might have
helped him with his grief
send it through
without any explanation
frederik russell and i met
actually on the gippsland
catchment project in 98
and worked together on that
interviewer so you guys have known
each other for a few years
yeah a good few years yeah
do you remember how he was
affected after alices death
what changed
it was work as normal and
that was troubling actually
i didnt really know what
to say to him about that
you never spoke about it
not really
everyone grieves in their own way
and it wasnt really my place
to be telling him how to feel
but i certainly
i certainly was concerned
russell i was really grateful
that i had my work
and i mean i felt really
guilty about that at the time
but you know i just
wanted to get on with it
then one night in late february
i came home from work and i
was sitting in the kitchen
and i heard a noise
coming from alis room
so i went into alis room
and i dont really know why
but i sort of found
myself sitting down
in the chair in front
of the dresser
and before i could kind of work
out what i was doing there
ali walked in and she
went over to her desk
and started sharpening a pencil
and then she looked like she was checking
for a text message on her phone
and you know i was
completely freaked out
she was completely
oblivious to my presence
and then i dont know what happened
i must have moved the bed
or you know squeaked
my shoes or something
but she went completely rigid
and i knew then that
she knew i was there
and she slowly turned around and she
looked me right in the eye fully for
you know what felt like forever
and then she just came at me and stood
up and said get out get out
and i just got up and went
out as fast as i could
i could hear russell crying
and he was here in the kitchen
mathew and i both
found him in here
and he was sobbing
he was absolutely inconsolable
interviewer do you believe russell
when he says he saw a ghost
yeah i do
i believe he saw what he saw
and he wouldnt hes not the
kind of man to make something up
so i believe he saw something
whether its a real ghost
or not i dont really know
but im sure he saw something
georgie i remember trying to
talk to members of the church
about how to help june
and how to help the palmers
but there just didnt seem like
there was anything we could do
i think part of the reason was
because they werent churchgoers
so didnt know how to
offer them comfort
i dont even know
what june believes in
i found myself mostly
concerned about mathew
i guess because those two
were always so close
i was worried how he would cope
i remember he was spending
a lot more time alone
we were all worried about him
mathew came in with some
unusual bruises on his body
they were unusual in terms of
their distribution and depth
we obviously took a history
trying to exclude trauma
but there was certainly no history of
trauma that he was able to give us
we tested him for vasculitis
and we also excluded any poisoning
or toxins in his system
we were unable to turn
up anything conclusive
and several weeks after this the
bruises just resolved spontaneously
and we were never able to really
establish a cause for them
my names steve wilkie
im mathews best friend
i usually stay at mathews house
two or three times a week
we started a band together so we
normally play music at my house
mathew seems a bit quieter but
he was always pretty quiet
so i guess there wasnt really any
warning bells going off or anything
well i had heard about june
going into peoples houses
and mathew never really seemed to
want to talk about any of that
i never asked him about any of it
leith i know that he was always
interested in photography
and he was
at this time he was starting
to pursue it with more passion
clive mathew came to me
he was very keen
to find out anything
about photography
so i was more than willing to
help out thats what i do
so he was picking my brains about
just about anything to do with it
from equipment down to techniques
down to lighting you know
but he was a great asset so
i mean eventually i employed him
interviewer mathew can you talk to
me about the photographs
of the backyard that
youve been taking
yeah basically ive
taken that same photo
with that composition for i think every
three months for the past four years
and its just a photograph
of the backyard
looking out you can see
the hills in the distance
its just like a little project
that i set up for myself
when we got here
interviewer and what was in the april
28th photograph that was different
well its basically the same shot
but it would appear that alice
is standing against the fence
do you remember what the reaction
in the house was at the time
i wouldnt say the mood was good
but it was better than before
it was like like it gave us sort
of something to focus on i think
all of us
bob the photographs were
taken on the 3rd of april
and they were developed on the 4th and
i looked at them i think on the 5th
and looked at the dams and the water
levels and i was quite happy
but it was only the following night that
it was pointed out to me by my wife
that there was something
in the background
in norval dam this image came up
june when i first looked
at the photograph
i didnt know what to make of it
the image was quite unsettling
because it certainly
looked like alice
it was an incredibly
discomforting image
and i became convinced
that alice was still alive
russell i didnt have any rational
explanation for who was in those photos
but i did know something
about alice that june didnt
id seen alices body
i didnt think she was alive
i knew she wasnt
i became convinced that
russell had made a mistake
he himself said that it didnt
look like anybody anymore
june was so convinced
that id made a mistake
that i actually started
to have doubts myself
i started to think maybe
id made my mind up
that it was alices
body before id looked
and that the circumstances
were so compelling for me
that id decided that it was her
more than three months after the funeral
of ararat teenager alice palmer
her grieving parents
formally requested
her body be exhumed
from the general cemetery
there has been some contention
from the palmer family
about the accuracy of the
original body identification
june and russell palmer were adamant
that dna testing be carried out
they just couldnt be sure
that the body they identified
was indeed alice
trudeau and today almost
russell alices body was exhumed
in the presence of the funeral
director dr slatter
and there was a representative
from the coroners office also
and it was then transported
to ararat base hospital
where they took the dna samples
and she stayed there until
the results came back
june
a few days later we received a copy
of the coroners
preliminary report
and alices identity was confirmed
by the dna sample match
russell it was only after theyd
confirmed that it was alices body
that i realized how much
that id invested
in the possibility
of it not being her
you know i cant tell you how
much i wanted there to have been
a terrible mistake
even if it had been mine
really really wanted there to have
been somebody elses kid in that dam
a runaway a murder victim
just anybody elses just as
long as it wasnt my kid
just as long as it wasnt alice
yes it is
laughing
stop it
laughing
dog barking
people chattering
people clapping
all laughing
oh my god
screaming
june alice was reburied two
days later on the 7th of june
but the question remained who
or what was in those photos
well i continued
to hear things and
interviewer what did you hear
i was hearing noises sort of
they didnt really relent i kept
hearing noises in the hallway
so i thought well
ill just set up a camera
to see if i see anything
see something
the first night i looked back and
there was footage of a figure
moving from the lounge room across
the hallway to the front door
helen over radio
youre on voice fm 802
im helen bath
and were taking calls
with psychic consultant
ray kemeney
next we have nadia
on the line ray
ray hi nadia how are you
what can i do for you
nadia my question is about career and
ive also got a question about family
june it was around about
that time i decided
to seek out the advice
of ray kemeney
i had heard ray on the
radio over the years
and opinion was quite divided
some thought he was the real deal
others were unconvinced
helen
next we have annie on the line
ray hi annie how are you
annie im fine thanks ray
thank you for taking my call
my pleasure
what can i do for you
i just wanted a general reading
general not just medical
ray im hungarian by birth
my parents came out here
when i was quite young
ive got a 15yearold daughter who lives
with her mother in south australia
my christian name is actually
schultz but i changed it to ray
i think its a more trustworthy
name for a psychic
australias wog psychic of choice
most of what i do is
when im dealing with
the sick or the dying
which i guess probably fits
about a third of my clients
is to allow them the possibility
that death is not the bitter end
that its not the full stop
which is a consolation that
im quite happy to give them
considering the fact that what happens
after death is up for grabs anyway
theres somebody very close to you
someone you havent
seen for a while
someone who is going to
come back into your life
someone wholl be of
great comfort to you
anyone that fits that bill
annie
yeah i can think of someone
look i wont lie to you annie
i can see obstacles ahead of you
but i think that this person
who is coming back to you
is gonna make a great difference
and will be of great solace to you
crying thanks ray
see you annie
where i come from
when someone dies
they block out all the
mirrors in the house
to stop the dead from
finding their way back
its things like that
that make a difference
hi annie im ray
whispering indistinctly
sniffling
youre gonna die annie
its just the start of
something else all right
thank you
its all right
okay
june i liked ray immediately
he wasnt what i expected
i dont know what
i really did expect
but there was nothing
kind of spooky
or fake about him
button beeps
okay are we ready
mmmhmm
i want you to close your eyes
ray
i usually video tape my sessions
so that they can be reviewed
later by the clients
especially when theres elements
of trance or hypnotism involved
i keep one copy for myself
one copy for them
better to be safe than sorry
okay so youre standing
outside your house
tell me what you see
my house
june on tape its a white house
im walking towards the front door
ray on tape okay
now i want you to go
inside the house
i want you to move
slowly through the house
i want you to describe
what you see
where you are just
give me a guided tour
okay im walking down the hallway
towards alices room
whats there
i can see alices shoes
outside her room
and what does that
mean for you june
she always used to leave her
sneakers outside her room
so i want you to go
inside her room now
open the door and
just move inside
you feel safe enough to
go into alices room
okay
now open the door
im going inside her room
you can see something cant you
tell me what you see june
shes
alice is sitting in the wicker
chair at the end of her bed
she looks sad
russell i first met ray when
june brought him home for dinner
the night of her
first consultation
and yeah im completely
indifferent to psychics
i dont really have
a position on them at all
i dont really want them to come
round for dinner mind you
but you know i didnt
want to upset june either
he was a pleasant sort of a bloke
he wasnt ookyspooky at all
and i was on my best behavior
a few days later
maybe a week later
i suggested to the family
that we hold a seance
june was really keen but i remember
russell just flat out refused
i think mathew finally
talked his dad around
interviewer mathew how did you feel
about having a seance held in your house
at the time i was actually kind
of interested sort of curious
i dont think dad was
thrilled about the idea
but yeah i thought
it would be interesting
and i suggested we film it
and i recorded it with
just our video camera
which is the pc9
im getting a strong
presence in the room
in the house
june i think we all thought that
the seance was a failure
ray didnt really
come up with anything
like with any signs or anything
so after about an hour
or so we called it quits
and it wasnt until the next day
that mathew was
reviewing the footage
that there was an image of alice
make your presence known to us
russell the new footage was completely
different to the hallway footage
for one it was significantly more
detailed so it was less ambiguous
and it was impossible to dismiss it
as a coincidence of shadow
play and digital noise
there was something inexplicable in
our house that was beyond doubt
i was concerned this was pretty
unfamiliar territory for me
ive never seen a ghost before
russell
ray got mathew to help him set up
three permanent cameras
inside the house
recording in timelapse
configurations 24 hours a day
thered been a lot of speculation about
ray and what he was doing there
i mean when people dont know
that of course leads to a lot
of talk and a lot of speculation
i had heard rumors throughout
july of video images
purporting to be of an
apparition in the house
but i must say i was skeptical
as to their legitimacy
interviewer and your view on ray
also very skeptical
i think they had me as some
kind of rasputin figure
mesmerizing the palmers
stealing their money
doctoring the photos of alice
all singing
mathew in particular seemed
to be really struggling
i thought i might be able to help
this boy by being there you know
blows
russell good one
beautiful
june well done
ray that said my chief
motivation was professional
something was happening
inside that house
and i wanted to find
out what it was
interviewer what was your
reaction to these images
russell we were completely
gobsmacked by them
but before we had time to you
know take in what that meant
the withers video came out
doug go on
is it good
yeah its great
can i have a look
yeah be careful
june cathy and doug withers were
at the dam on april the 3rd
the same day that the bob
smeet photo was taken
doug be careful
cathy
what do you think im going to do
give it back
be careful
cathy its safe in my hands babe
cathy exclaiming
it was a couple of months
later the end of july
when we were looking at our footage
that wed shot down at the dam
and came across
cathy a figure in the background
which we identified as bob smeet
which interested us
cause theres
yeah clearly we didnt
we sort of went
oh it was the same
day he was there
when he captured the image that
people have been talking about
so then we went
through all our footage
to see if we perhaps might have
captured that figure as well
maybe the camera
had seen what bob saw
yeah yeah
and we did find a figure
in the background
like the image that had been
described in his picture
and then we looked more closely
and doug zoomed in on it
yeah i got right in
on the computer
and from what you know could
have looked like a female figure
from a long way away
up close and tight
you could see that it definitely
was neither female nor alice
it was mathew
interviewer do you guys believe in ghosts
laughing no
no no
laughs no
matthew well this is where i was
when the bob smeet photo was taken
i was wearing alices jacket and i
looked up and i saw a man on the hill
who turned out to be bob smeet
and i didnt wanna be in a photo
so i walked off through the bush
what i didnt see was there was
also a couple over there filming
who turned out to be the withers
when the withers thing
came out dad came to me
and asked me if i had been
involved in anything else
and i didnt wanna lie
to him so i told him
and i explained to dad
that i was responsible
for the image of alice
in the hallway
and the bedroom and that i created
the april 28th backyard photo
and the seance image
i just told him what id done
okay so
i got two photos a photo
of alice and the backyard
and composited the images
thats a photo
that i took of alice
mum kept talking about
she was always talking
about getting alice exhumed
and she was really
keen on this idea
that dad had
misidentified her body
and so i knew that without more
evidence it wasnt going to happen
so i made the photograph
i just used an old video of alice
and i played that on the tv
i had the tv up on the book case
and it was as simple
as rotating the mirror
so that the reflection
of the tv came up in it
and obviously the
mirrors quite small
so it cropped out the
edges of the television
and then yeah i just filmed that
same with the kitchen
and the bedroom
what you see basically is alice
on the television in the mirror
like it wasnt about
trying to trick people
i guess it was like something
was better than nothing
interviewer do you think that what you
did ultimately made it worse for june
i think that
yeah yeah i probably did
make it harder for her
but i mean that
wasnt my intention
im not quite so sure
about his reasons
i dont know that i
totally
i dont want to say i dont
totally believe what he said
but im just not convinced
that he really knows why he did it
when it all came out people
wanted to do stories and books
and womens magazines the whole
lot just went pearshaped
look we just didnt
know how to handle it
i mean you know we had to protect
matty we had to protect ourselves
we had to protect alis memory
and we just didnt
have any experience
of dealing with all this interest
in something that
was incredibly personal
that people wanted
to make incredibly public
i mean the palmers werent
coping well at all at that point
and things were very bad
they were doing it tough
russell this was like the
end of hope for all of us
but especially for june
she just really wasnt
ready to let ali go
she just needed to hang on
to her a little bit longer
and i dont think she would admit
it but she was devastated
frederik
shes an interesting girl
she seemed to not get
on with june so well
i thought they actually
were quite alike
it was interesting that the two
of them might not get on so well
indistinct chattering
georgie
they always seemed very much alike
and you could see that alice
took a lot after june
but also other things had become
clear as well after alices death
that perhaps a bit of the
sense of the private
that they both shared
thanks for that
chuckling
june was well still is
she keeps to herself a lot
and it became clear that that
was happening with alice too
they had the sense of privacy
the sense that there is
their own private life
that they will either choose to
share or to not share i guess
iris its wonderful when
your children come
and that new expression
that you have
but as a mother youve
still always got doubts
that youre not doing enough or
youre not doing the right thing
i partly blame myself
thats come from me
maybe it came from my mother
ive never been able to
ive never been able to give
myself over wholly to
to june
i feel june is a little
like that too
that she couldnt give
herself wholly to alice
june i hope that alice did know
how much i loved her
i guess i held something back
a little as she grew older
that would be the saddest thing
to think she might not know
ray suggested that
mathew accompany him
on one of his country
victorian tours
where he was doing consultations
and mathew jumped at the chance
breakfast
your shout i think
matthew
no i think its your shout
matthew i think i realized when i
was away how much i missed alice
and that i was never going to
be able to speak to her again
i guess thats something that
all of rays clients
are coming to terms with
you know they want
to talk to someone
or make contact with
someone theyve lost
and so did i
so i was sort of one of rays
clients in a way as well
matthew no
can i chuck it at you
no
lets see what happens
well what do you
think is gonna happen
its gonna hit me and
then im gonna get angry
thats whats gonna happen no
june watch yourself
what are you doing in my room
matthew i dont know
matthew chuckling
get out
matthew when me and
ray went on the tour
we left the two rented cameras
where they were in the hallway
i was sure there was still
something in the house
and obviously cause we were
away for the three days
you know we couldnt change
the tapes or anything
so we knew we were probably gonna get
about like a day and a half of footage
but we left them running
and got back on august 22nd
at which point
we checked the tapes
june only russell and
i were in the house
when these images were recorded
mathew couldnt have had
anything to do with them
they seemed to prove that there
was a ghost in our house
alices ghost
interviewer
do you believe in ghosts
didnt used to
but its a hard thing
to prove or disprove
i think
yeah sometimes i think
maybe they do exist
there are ghosts everywhere
its a scary world
i dont know why its important
its like how it helps people
like dealing with her loss
like making up stories
about ghosts or whatever
june it threw a question
mark over everything
i went back and reviewed all the
footage that had come before
all the material taken inside the
house following alices death
it was while i was looking at mathews
june 13th hallway material again
that i noticed
something in the image
there was a second figure
not mathew in the hallway
but someone else
squatting in the dark
in alices room
at first i thought it was alice
then i realized it was our
neighbor brett toohey
what was this man doing in my
house in my daughters room
more than six months
after her death
when i found alices safe i realized
exactly why hed been there
he was looking for the tape
thats it
chattering indistinctly
but it was such a
it wasnt a very nice day
yes
you did a smoke ring
yes
brett on tape you two getting nice
and cozy without me
girls giggling on tape
june alice began babysitting
for the tooheys in 2002
and she continued for the
next two and a half years
the tooheys two boys were
five and nine years old
i literally just couldnt
believe my eyes
moaning
it just made me feel so sad
giggling
russell as far as im concerned
the tooheys were complicit
in alis death
i believe that if it hadnt been for
them she would have reached out to us
she wouldnt have felt guilty
she wouldnt have felt the
burden of that secret
she wouldnt have been isolated
interviewer
how do you feel towards brett now
if he was around the corner
id probably throttle him
he seemed like a nice guy
you know he was nice
wed speak and he was never like
you know nasty or anything
kylie he had a pool at his
place and usually
kate
we used to swim there sometimes
meredith yeah during the summer
so usually we just go to his
place and have a swim there
people chattering
i was really bewildered
about you know what happened
yeah
it took a lot just to realize
cause you know i had no
idea that alice would
no be with
somebody i know
yeah it was like
a complete surprise
like we just didnt think you
know shed do something like that
yeah
interviewer why do you think
alice had the tape
because she didnt
want them to have it
interviewer why is that
she didnt trust them
anymore i think
russell they mustve been really
desperate to get that tape
from the moment that theyd
heard of alices death
they wouldve been living in this
constant fear of being found out
im glad he couldnt find it
im glad he knows its not over
sandy
i had a lot of personal dealings
with the palmers during this time
as part of the investigating team
trying to locate brett and
marissa toohey and family
and initially we were optimistic
that they would be found
and charges laid
but unfortunately the leads
that we were working with
soon dried up and so
the investigation stalled
so the polices advice to us was
that even if the tooheys were caught
they would get off with
a suspended sentence
by claiming that the
sex was consensual
which was they claimed you know
supported by the video evidence
interviewer jason did you know about
alices involvement with brett
no no one did
obviously i didnt
we wouldnt be going out if i did
it was no
i thought we were
i thought we were pretty good
june it just left so many
unanswered questions
why was she involved with him
when did the relationship begin
was she in love
with either of them
i just dont know
the tooheys sold their house and
moved six months after alice died
kim alice kept secrets
she kept the fact she
kept secrets a secret
which does change the way that
you see somebody i suppose
when you realize that they did
hide things from you a bit
i think i knew one alice and
maybe her mum knew another
and there was another one again
that none of us knew maybe
june i found rays business card
taped to alices diary
on the page marked
12th of july 2005
ray on tape
why have you come to see me alice
alice on tape
can you interpret dreams
mmmhmm sometimes
how do you feel when you
wake up from these dreams
they scare me a bit
alice came to see me about
five months before she died
i think shed heard me
on the radio a few times
and rang and made an appointment
take a deep breath
close your eyes
i want you to imagine youre
standing outside your house
when you can see that you tell me
okay
giggles yeah
all right now i want you
to go inside the front door
go into the house tell me
what you see where you are
interviewer ray why didnt you tell june
that youd actually met alice before
okay im in the entrance
ray look i dont think it was a
case of hiding something from them
it was more that i was honoring
alices request for confidentiality
but it was damned if you do
damned if you dont you know
the living rooms
just directly ahead
then you go to your right
and my rooms in the back part of the
house as you go towards the kitchen
do you see anything unusual
anything different
no
no we didnt feel like we
could trust ray anymore
for whatever reasons he had of
keeping that information to himself
it still felt like a betrayal
ray i wanted to help
june and the family
and i think they
wanted me to help them
i wouldnt have been able
to do it if theyd known
there was a fair bit of resentment
mathew wouldnt even speak to me
but what i think really hurt
them more than anything
was what they saw as my failure
to see alices eminent passing
looking back like
its kind of strange
that someone would you know
be as close to us as he was
i think maybe he needed us
as much as we needed him
ray alice came to see me
because she was upset
she was a very troubled person
june i had a dream last night
i was cold and wet
i felt heavy like id been drugged
and when i woke up
these sensations didnt go
i was feeling sick and confused
and i was starting to get scared
voice trembling
i needed to see mum to talk to her
i stumbled to her room
and as i stood there at
the bed watching them
i was overcome by
this intense sadness
then the sadness turned to fear
i just stood there
paralyzed with fear
and i realized there was nothing
that they could do for me anymore
ive never felt so utterly alone
everything felt wrong my body
the way things looked
then i realized that there
was something wrong with me
i started to cry standing
there at the foot of the bed
lake mungo is in southwestern
new south wales
and that was the location of the
school camp that alice went on
from august the 2nd
to the 5th in 2005
when she came home she
said shed had a good time
i do particularly remember it
because she came home
without her mobile phone
which wed bought her
a month previously
and her favorite
bracelet and watch
yes other than that you know she
didnt really talk about it too much
people screaming
girl wait guys
people laughing
jason well kim didnt show me till about
a year after she got back from camp
the stuff that shed taken
on her mobile phone
interviewer
so whyd you decide to tell june
well if we didnt tell june
then it would be like
we were hiding something
so i dont know why
i dont know why but why not
girl smile for me
smile
theyre a little
bit tipsy thats all
june jason told us about
the phone footage
that the girls had
taken at lake mungo
girls laughing
the other girls were
looking so happy
and she looked quite forlorn
i was worried i became convinced
that something had happened to her
girl so just get a little bit
just some of it
june kates phone footage
was taken later that night
once the girls had spread
out over the lunettes
girl anywhere
i think that we need
to get a photo
girl 2 like africa
like the desert
june there was an image of
alice very hard to decipher
in the bottom of the frame
kneeling under a tree
it was only after viewing
the clip several times
that we realized
what she was doing
she was burying something
interviewer i mean did you know what
had happened that night with alice
no
i knew shed lost her phone
i knew she was upset because
that was pretty obvious
but i didnt know
why she was upset
she didnt say that
shed seen anything
she didnt really
say anything to me
i didnt really perhaps take
it that seriously at the time
you know it was like context
you know we were
just having a good time
and i just thought
shed gotten a bit upset
june it started simply enough
alice left the group
and started walking
off by herself
but it was obviously
something was distressing her
and we wanted to try and
find out what it was
russell we understood from the phone
video that shed buried something
we had an idea where the tree was
because of what we could
see from the video
we didnt really want to go
down during the day time
because you know we
didnt want to be digging
you know where tourists were
so we decided to go at night
indistinct whispering
june and i started
digging and after a bit
june said shed found something
and she pulled out a plastic bag
and inside the plastic bag there
was alis favorite necklace
her ring her watch
her mobile phone
her most precious things
buried out here on a school camp
and we didnt know
why she did that
i mean we knew from the video
that shed buried something
but we didnt know what it was
russell its low on battery
ray on tape
are you scared of dying
yeah of course
im scared of dying
isnt everyone scared of dying
would you like to tell me a little bit
about what happens in these dreams
i feel like something bad
is gonna happen to me
i feel like something
bad has happened
it hasnt reached me yet
but its on its way
and its getting closer
and i dont feel ready
i feel like i cant do anything
june at some point
this figure came towards her
from out of the darkness
russell i recognized the face as soon
as i saw it on the phone video
it was the same face of the body
that i had identified at the dam
it was alis body and alis face
there is absolutely no
rational explanation
for what she saw on that phone
shouting indistinctively
stay far away from me
oh my god theyre coming
stay away
girls screaming
june i am convinced that alice
knew she was going to die
im convinced of that
girl
bundle up bundle up bundle up
i think the figure at lake
mungo was an omen for her
the burial of her
possessions was symbolic
it was a ritual
russell no i was never convinced
that ali believed she was gonna die
you know she had morbid thoughts
sure i mean who doesnt
and she had nightmares that upset
her and enough to consult ray
i dont know that anybodys
really convinced
that theyre gonna die
interviewer and what about
the image at lake mungo
how do you think alice
would have explained that
how could she have explained it
look i think ali saw a ghost
but she wasnt to know
that it was her own
i believe she recorded a ghost
i believe she recorded the
future coming to get her
june we had found out
about the tooheys
ray and what had
happened at lake mungo
and by the time we returned home
the house felt different it was
calm
i think that alice wanted
us to know more about her
she wanted us to know
who she really was
before she
you know before she could leave
indistinct chatter
in the weeks and months
after lake mungo
we started to feel
like a family again
it just crept up on us really
we were a little
battered and wobbly
but we were a family all the same
all laughing
hi ray
nice to see you russell
yeah you too
nice come in
june ray called out of the blue
and said he was going to
be coming through town
and asked if it was all right if
he could come round and visit
six months had gone by
and i just felt that
under the circumstances
i didnt think it
could do any harm
russell i think we all felt
that after mungo
in our own ways thered been
closure i suppose to a degree
and you know for each
of us its different
and for each of us
weve made our own peace
it seems strange to me that ali
should withdraw so abruptly
and we didnt help her
we didnt change anything
i think we just collectively
made a decision to move forward
and you know moving
was really a big part of all that
deciding to move
people chattering
upbeat music playing on speaker
june it will be difficult
to leave the house
sometimes you know
i just forget that
shes not coming back
i forget
ray okay
close your eyes
and imagine that youre back
standing outside the house
mmmhmm
can you see it
go inside the house
im going through the front door
and
walking down the hall
towards alices room
alice someones there
i think someones
coming down the hall
june doors open
do you know who it is
do you want to go inside
yeah
okay
what do you see
alice its my mum
whats she saying
shes not
shes not saying anything
i dont think she knows im there
alice isnt here
shes not here
whats happening alice
are you talking to her
is she talking to you
shes going now
shes leaving the room
shes gone
open your eyes
sighs
