frontier in 1882 
a hard land for hard folk 
food was scarce 
disease was rampant 
and life was a daily
struggle for survival 
hell  this was
miss america in 1880 
holy shit 
to build a home and a life in
this harsh  unforgiving country
required that a man be bold 
fearless  and tough as iron 
the men who were
courageous and resilient
were the men who prospered 
but some men were
just big  giant pussies 
well  well 
surprised you showed up  stark 
yeah  well  you said
you would kill my family
and burn my house down
if i didn t  so   
draw 
is there anything
at all that i can say
to get you to call this off 
you yellow  stark 
okay  well  that s a little
racist to our hardworking friends
over here from the far
east  right  guys 
draw  you son of a bitch 
look  i just feel like if we
can talk this out  you know 
we can find a calm 
rational solution
and maybe we even
laugh about it one day 
i ain t in the mood
to laugh  stark 
look  there s
always humor in any   
hey  look  this will make you laugh 
look at our shadows 
it looks like our shadows are
about to kiss each other 
look at that 
wait  watch this  my god  charlie 
my god 
thank you  this is
so generous of you 
wow  this is   
what a terrific guy you are 
we barely know each other  but  hey 
when it s right  it s right 
i ll give you a little tap on the
hat when i m good to go  okay 
look  we re laughing  right 
we re laughing now 
what were we even
fighting about 
i can t remember 
can you 
your goddamn sheep grazed
up half my ranch  stark 
that grass ain t
never gonna grow back 
all right  look 
how about this 
i ll pay you the money
you lost  okay 
just give me two days
to sell off
a few of my sheep
and i ll get you the money 
all right 
just two days 
if i don t have that cash 
i m coming after ya 
okay  great  thank you so
much for your patience 
i really appreciate it 
and what a relief
for all these people
who came out here
hoping that we would
find an amicable
solution to this 
aw  somebody shoot some fucker 
i took a half day
off work for this 
okay  i just want to point out
that guy s an english
teacher at our school 
just a little taste 
i mean  that should
have been the end of it  right 
i mean  i tell him
i ll pay him off 
we go our separate ways 
and that s it 
but  no  he shoots me
in the fucking leg 
i mean  it s just a graze 
but come on  look at that 
what 
you should have fought him 
i should have fought him 
you re serious 
louise  my god  the guy is one
of the best shots around 
i look like i have parkinson s next to him 
what is that 
it s just another way god
mysteriously shows that he loves us 
but  look  it would have been
suicide to fight that guy 
albert  i m breaking
up with you 
what 
yeah  i m sorry 
i got shot today 
i know 
wait  wait  wait 
hang on a sec 
louise  where is
this coming from 
is this because of the gunfight 
no  i ve actually been feeling
this way for a while 
you re a great guy 
i just   
i realized that
i want something else 
something else  louise  it s
been a year and a half 
look  i know i m just a sheep
farmer  but i m saving money   
yeah  but you re not even a
good sheep farmer  albert 
your sheep are everywhere 
the one thing a sheep
farmer has to do
is keep all of his sheep
in one place  all right 
i went to your farm
the other day 
and i saw one in the backyard 
three way up on the ridge 
two in the pond 
and one on the roof 
okay  that s bridget  all right 
she has a problem with retardation 
but she s full of love 
look  we re getting off
track here  all right 
why don t you just tell
me what the problem is
and then maybe i can fix it 
maybe if i were older 
the timing would be right 
but people are living
to be 35 these days
and a girl doesn t
have to just go off
and get married right away 
i just  i have to   
i have to work on myself 
my god 
you did not just say that  what 
 i have to work
on myself  
louise  that s the
oldest line in the book 
you realize that 
you know what 
it s okay  though 
it s all right  i know
why you re saying it 
it s because you don t want to
tell me that i m the problem 
goodbye  albert

albert 
hey  guys 
we heard about louise 
that s horrible 
we re so sorry  albert 
do you want to sit down 
i m good  i m gonna
rest my asshole 
i was just looking at these old
pictures of me and louise 
this is from the carnival 
yeah 
there s the town picnic 
this is the square dance 
i almost wish you could
smile in photographs 
louise has such
an amazing smile 
that d be weird 
have you ever smiled
in a photograph 
no  have you 
god  no 
no  you d look like
an insane person 
but  it s just  you know 
i ve been sitting here
trying to figure
out how the hell
i could have screwed this up 
i did everything for her 
if she was happy i was happy 
that s all i cared about 
and she was the one
thing that made the shootings 
and the diseases  and the wild
animals  and the indians 
and the general depressing
awfulness about the west
bearable 
god  i love her so much 
you re gonna make me cry 
let s get fucked up 
yeah 
so  what are you gonna do 
i don t know what i m gonna do 
commit suicide  maybe 
albert  i know everything
seems hopeless right now 
but i promise you  there s
so much to live for 
really  is there 
what is there to live for on
the frontier in 1882 
look  let me tell you something 
we live in a terrible
place and time 
the american west is a disgusting 
awful  dirty  dangerous place 
look around you 
everything out here that s
not you wants to kill you 
outlaws  angry drunk people 
scorned hookers  hungry animals 
diseases  major and minor
injuries  indians  the weather 
you can get killed just
going to the bathroom 
i take my life in my hands every
time i walk out to my outhouse 
there s fucking rattlesnakes
all in the grass out there 
and even if i make it 
you know what can kill me 
cholera 
you know cholera 
the black shit 
the black shit 
the latest offering in the frontier s
disease of the month club 
and even if you survive
all those things 
you know what else can kill you 
the fucking doctor 
the doctor can kill you 
i had a cold a couple of years ago 
i went in there 
you know what he said to me 
he goes 
 you need
an ear nail  
a nail in my fucking ear 
that is modern medicine for you 
 yeah  doc 
i have a fever of 102  
 you need
a donkey kickin   
you know our pastor has shot two people 
our pastor 
no  no 
no 
honest to god 
shot a guy in a duel
and then went back and
killed the guy s teenage son
because he was afraid he would
kill him out of revenge 
wait  how do you know that 
because he did a whole
fucking sermon about it 
a lesson about
seeing things through 
by the way  look at this 
see those guys over there 
the guys who work in the silver mines 
see what they re eating 
ribs doused in hot sauce 
they eat hot spicy foods
every meal of the day 
do you know why 
because their palates are so
completely fucking dulled
from inhaling poisoned gas  12
hours a day  down in the mines 
that s all they can taste 
you know what that kind of
diet does to your guts 
constipation  cramps 
dyspepsia  liver disease 
kidney disease  hemorrhoids 
bowel inflammation 
they literally die
from their own farts 
and  you want to see more death 
all we got to do is get up
and walk out the front door 
that is our mayor 
he is dead 
he has been lying there 
dead  for three days 
no one has done a thing 
not moved him 
not looked into his death 
not even replaced him
with a temporary appointee 
for the last three days  the
highest ranking official in our town
has been a dead guy 
look at that 
look at that 
wolves are dragging the body away
as if to illustrate my point 
bye  bye  mr  mayor 
bye  have fun becoming
wolf shit  bye 
god 
that  my friends 
is the american west 
a disgusting  awful  dirty cesspool
of despair  and fuck all of it 
why don t you shut up 
you shut up 
ruth 
jesus christ 
stop it 
okay  fine 
at least have dr  harper
take a look at it tomorrow 
if you could hear
yourself right now 
you know what s gonna happen
if i go to dr  harper
and i say

yeah  thanks 
okay 
that came out of my penis

with those stick hoops lately 
i know  me  too 
it s got to be bad
for their brains  right 
yeah  it stunts
their attention span 
i read an article in the paper 
yeah  i saw that  it s like
they lose the power to innovate
because they re staring
at the stick hoop all day 
yep 
by the way  they re delivering
the town s ice shipment today 
you want to go watch 
yeah  that d be fun  yeah 
yeah  it s always a thrill
when you get to see
that much ice all in one place 
yeah  i think so  too

feel a lot better 
church is not gonna   
hey  look 
it s the ice 
why is it so big 
so it doesn t melt 
that s so neat 
i know  it s actually really
interesting how they do it 
it s this one company
out in boston
that basically
cuts it in big blocks
from frozen lakes and ponds  and
they just ship it all over the   
my god 
my god 
that went south so fast 
and make
no mistake  my children 
there shall be swift and righteous
justice on all free grazers 
no more shall
they nibble wantonly
at the teat of our coffers 
and that s just exactly
like that part in the bible
that applies to that situation 
i would also like to offer
a heartfelt prayer
to the family of james addison 
who was killed this morning
while unloading
the ice shipment 
james  we will think
of you lovingly this july
as we sip the cold
summer beverages
for which you gave your life 
they re still
gonna use the fucking ice

to take over the schoolmarm job 
our old schoolmarm got her throat
slit by a fast moving tumbleweed 
my god 
yeah 
in front of the kids 
yeah  yeah 
all of them 
let me help you 
that is just painful to watch 
and  you know  it s like the
whole time we were together
i just remember thinking 
 how can i possibly
be this happy  
 she likes me now  
 but one day 
she is gonna figure out 
 that she is
too good for me  
and then one day  she did 
i feel like i finally tricked one
girl into falling in love with me
and then i lost her 
i think you have this
whole thing upside down 
i mean  it sounds like you ve bent
over backwards for this girl 
but what has she given you back 
i told you  she allowed
me to be happy
in a part of the world that
is otherwise a living hell 
 allowed   wow 
that s kind of fucked up that
you would use that word 
you know that  right 
all i know is that there
is nothing for me out here
if i don t have her 
well 
if this foy guy is
that much of a douche 
she ll figure it out
if she s smart 
sometimes a girl has to get a
few assholes out of her system
before she realizes what
a good guy looks like 
maybe 
you okay 
this is actually
my first cigarette ever 
my god 
shit 
diamondback 
it s a diamondback  yeah  fuck

still  and it ll go away

going to the stupid fair 
louise is gonna be there 
and she s gonna be with foy 
i don t want to
put myself through
that kind of
fucking aggravation 
yeah  well  i ll go with you 
no better way to make your
ex girlfriend want you back more
than to let her see
you with another girl 
i don t know 
especially a
smoking hot girl 
when she sees me  she ll
be intimidated as fuck 
you re very modest  i see 
i m a little cocky 
but i got great tits 
sorry  sorry  sir

you realize they re probably
gonna hang you for this 
who gives a fuck what they want 
when clinch gets into town  it s
not gonna matter what they do 
he ll bust me out
and anyone who tries to stop
him is gonna be a dead man 
you know  one of these days
there s gonna be a man
who s faster than clinch
and tougher  and stronger 
and then clinch is
gonna be the dead man 
and i m gonna smoke a
fucking cigar to celebrate 
i don t think clinch would
like you talking about him that way

wife to say about her husband

i mean  take your pick 
she s   
i feel great when i m with her 
she s classy  she s fun 
she s insanely gorgeous 
hey  no  look 
she s really pretty  yes 
but honestly  and i m
sorry to say this 
i don t see what else
she s got going for her 
my impression was that she was a
little sour and self absorbed 
and for a guy with
so much going for him 
i just thought that maybe you   
i don t know what you think
i have going for me  but   
you see 
there you go again 
just cutting yourself down 
you act like this girl
was performing
some kind of a charitable
act by dating you 
albert  you re a catch 
you re sweet  you re
funny  you re smart 
you ve made something
of yourself out here 
you know  a lot of
people can t say that 
you re a good sheep farmer 
my god  please 
i suck at sheep 
louise was right 
i can t keep track of them 
there was a sheep in the
whorehouse last week 
really 
yeah 
wandered in there  and then
when i went to pick it up 
somehow  it had made  20 
but  you know  thank you
anyway for what you said 
look  the west fucking sucks 
but the frontier
is not your problem 
it s you 
you need a little confidence
boost  my friend 
now  aim up  sheep boy 
hey 
there we go

so  all i gotta do is get foy to let
me shoot 16 times before he shoots

we re gonna get there 
hey

one of anna barnes 
very special
super super secret cookies

a pot cookie  isn t it 
it s a pot cookie 
no  no  no 
no  i don t do well
with that stuff at all 
it s a pot cookie 
yeah  i know 
no  thank you 
just have a little bit with me 
my worst fear is to od
on a recreational drug 
no  thank you 
on a pot cookie 
the last time somebody
gave me one of these
i became convinced that prairie
dogs could read my mind 
just take a little bit 
i ll take a very  very small bite 
just a small bite 
a very small bite 
that s it 
are you kidding me 
nope  deadly serious 
let s see what this does
and if i don t throw
myself off this cliff
during some awful
freak out  then   
just take that
little bit  right there 
well  now you ve touched it 
take the other side 
there you go 
there 
and now  we just wait
for the sun to set 
this is really weird 
is it supposed to be like this 
you gave me
the right amount  right 
you don t think i took too much 
just ride it out 
this is   
wow  my bones are
in really deep today 
like  there s a lot more
skin than there usually is 
i think my body is padding
up for the winter 
which is weird 
because it s not winter 
but there s a lot more there 
there s something wrong
with my swallowing 
this is not how
i usually swallow 
my god  anna  he knows 
what  what  what 
he knows what we re doing 
he knows what this is 
he knows what this is 
i don t wanna   
no  i don t wanna join 
i don t wanna join up 
suppertime  you lazy prick 
goddamn waste of lungs 
who s lazy now  sheriff 
hey 
wow 
you look amazing 
and maybe
a little uncomfortable 
shit 
i m totally overdressed 
aren t i 
no 
i ve never done formal before 
and the lady at the boutique
told me to buy this
and no one else is wearing this 
who cares what   
these are all fuckers 
you look fantastic 
i look like jane austen
threw up all over me 
you do not look
like jane austen threw   
no  you look
absolutely beautiful 
you can breathe
in that thing  right 
there s nothing i like more than
putting on some loose 
baggy clothes 
and just being able to relax 
yeah  this is an end of the workday
outfit you have on 
i m very glad i
remembered the six items
i somehow require
to hold up my pants 
yeah 
i like your bustle  by the way 
yeah 
i really love that the most
alluring fashion statement
a woman can make today
is to simulate a fat ass 
that is a simulation of a fat
ass  right there  thank you 
if i was a black guy  this is the
meanest trick you could play on me 
because i d be like 
 my god  look  
 there s a fat ass 
my favorite  
and then i d lift it up and i d be
like   shit  it s a big joke  
i know  exactly  because
when you lift it up
there s nothing but
a metal cage under there 
wow 
you are ready to relieve
the stress of the day 
completely 
well  at the very least 
this will be a good way
to spend my last
night alive  right 
albert 
what 
do you trust me 
yeah  i do 
good  you re gonna
be fine 
if i thought you were
gonna lose this gunfight

how d you get tickets 
let me guess 
scalpers 
but i tell ya  folks  this telegraph
machine    that thing is nuts

than the pony express 
but what good is it if you can t
send a picture of your dick 
okay  they re
giving me the lantern 
enjoy the bison and i hope
you re enjoying your drinks
as much as my horse enjoyed
making them for you 
now  let s all line up
for the sweetheart dance 
come on  let s go 
no  no  no 
i suck at dancing

because you suck at everything 
well  well

and now  to serenade us
for the sweetheart dance 
our very own marcus thornton 
shit crowd 
ready for weird  stiff 
traditional frontier dancing 
fuck  yes 
you men who long for love
you mustn t all despair
there s a secret you should know
to capture
the hearts of the fair
you may not have the looks
you may not have the dash
but you ll win yourself a girl
if you ve only got a moustache
a moustache a moustache
if you ve only got a moustache
you may be common folk
without a hint of pride
but you needn t be a king
to make any maiden a bride
you may not have the name
you may not have the cash
but you ll make
that girl your own
if you ve only got a moustache
a moustache
a moustache if you ve
only got a moustache
you may be big and fat
or uglier than sin
all the ladies shut you out
you re wondering how to get in
well  here is my advice
for how to make a splash
you can have your pick of gals
if you ve only got a moustache
a moustache a moustache
if you ve only got a moustache
a moustache  a
moustache  a moustache
big moustache  thick moustache
my moustache  your moustache
say the word 
the word  moustache 
a moustache  a moustache
now we both have
said  moustache 
a moustache
a moustache if you ve
only got a moustache
fucking asshole 
how about i steal a bottle of
whiskey and we get out of here 
love that idea 
i ll be right back 
your dick s out 
hey 
so  albert and i
are gonna split 
but i just wanted to come by
and wish you luck tomorrow 
thank you 
so  i guess it s kind of weird
knowing that a woman
can outshoot you 
if you don t mind 
my girlfriend and i are
enjoying each other s company 
want to know the
real kicker  though 
i can outdrink you  too 
that  i can assure you 
is impossible 
fifty cents to the winner 
one 
two 
three 
shit 
don t feel bad 
alcohol doesn t harmonize well with a
woman s frail constitution  anyway 
i guess not 
here you go 
you can buy your
girlfriend a brain 
excuse me 
you re an idiot 
you have the nicest guy in the world
throwing himself at your feet
and here you are with
this complete asshole 
who i go out with
is my own business 
so  why don t you
mind your own  bitch 
how are you so blind
with eyes that big 
enjoy your night 
they re not that big 
no  my dear  they re
practically chinese 
god  i love you 
i love you  too 
how s that 
ooh 
wow 
um    it ll keep
us warm  though 
are you cold 
a little 
here  take   
no  no  no  it s okay 
no  it s fine  here 
this has been in my family
for 97 generations 
i can t get that goddamn
moustache song out of my head 
just think of another song 
i can t  there s only 
like  three songs 
that s true  and they re
all by stephen foster 
yeah 
um   
hey  you know  whatever
happens tomorrow 
i just    i just want
to say thank you 
i couldn t have gotten
this far without you 
and this may be the booze talking 
or your pep talk  or both 
but i think i can do it 
you know 
i think i can beat him 
well  i ll tell you this  you
sound a lot more confident
than that guy who dragged me out
of the saloon not too long ago 
you know  it s funny 
i still feel like i don t know
anything about you
after all this time 
and i feel like every time i bring
it up  you change the subject 
there really isn t
that much to tell 
my story is a lot
like yours  i suppose 
because i ll tell you  i hate the
west just as much as you do 
do you really 
for my own reasons  but  yeah 
i like you even more now 
there is something about
connecting over mutual hatred
that s just so much
deeper than mutual love 
it s true  right 
if two people hate the same
things  it creates a bond 
hate can move mountains 
yes 
hey  you know what 
before i forget 
hey  bridget  bridget 
yeah  she knows  come here  there we go 
my god 
what is this 
this is just a little
something to say thank you 
albert 
it s nothing huge  it s just   
okay  don t get too excited 
what is it  what is it 
what is it 
holy shit 
i know  right 
he s smiling 
yeah 
no  in the picture 
he s smiling 
isn t that amazing 
i bought that off a peddler who was
coming through town last week 
this is the guy i was
telling you about 
i didn t even know this existed 
and apparently  he s not insane 
bullshit 
that s what the guy told me 
it takes 30 seconds
to take a photograph 
this guy would
have had to sit there
and smile for 30
sustained seconds 
i know  i ve never been happy for
30 seconds in a row in my life 
no one has 
it s the fucking west 
he s gotta be insane 
who the fuck knows 
this is incredibly sweet 
it s nothing  it s   
i owe you 
no one s ever done
anything like this for me 
come on  now 
thank you 
i m sorry 
i    i shouldn t
have done that 
no  it s    it s fine 
you   
you ve just been a really good
friend to me  that s all 
yeah  i  um   
it s late 
yeah  i should take you home 
thanks 
good luck tomorrow 
i m gonna be there 
good 
okay 
um   
good night 
good night 
hello 
what    what s that 
nothing 
it s a weather experiment 
great scott 
are you sure
you can t call it off 
of course not 
i d be branded a coward 
baby  if you fight him
tomorrow  you will kill him 
yes  that s what
happens in a gunfight 
but he s not a bad guy  foy 
i mean  yeah 
he s kind of a loser
and he always smells like sheep 
but he doesn t
deserve to be shot 
louise 
my decision is final 
now  do it 
hey  i m really tired 
louise 
my social stature
is significant 
i m an important man 
i have my own business 
people envy me 
ooh   
what s wrong 
foy 
not now 
hello  sweetheart 
where s anna 
well  now 
i didn t think
you d show  sheepie 
yeah  listen  foy   
holy shit  you all   
you all done 
i m good 
okay 
listen  foy 
she s all yours 
louise 
you know  i really
do care about you 
but  i don t know 
somewhere along the line
i guess i just forgot that a
relationship is a two way street 
and i ve been reminded recently
of what it s like to have
somebody care about me 
and i like it 
so  if you want to spend the rest of
your life with a pussy full of hair 
i say  go with god
and best of luck to you 
you know  i just realized that last
joke might not have been clear 
i didn t mean that
she has a hairy pussy 
i meant that foy
has a moustache 
so  you know 
he gets hair in her
when he goes down there 
yeah 
i got it 
anna 
coward 
thank you 
she s not there 
well  i m sure she s okay 
i don t understand 
we ve been prepping for
this gunfight for a week 
she wouldn t just not show up 
hey  do you    do you think
you guys are gonna have sex 
maybe  at some point 
i don t know 
well  when you do  let us know
because maybe we can make
it an all us friends thing 
you know  we can all get in
sync together  sexually 
edward  we are not having sex 
sorry 
ruth  let s fuck 
coming 
she keeps my head on straight 
clinch leatherwood 
great 
look at this  another
thing that can kill us 
we should all just
wear coffins as clothes 
shh 
somebody in this wee shithole
of a town is going to die 
one of my boys saw a man
kissing my wife last night 
i want to know who it was 
man 
somebody s gonna get fucked up 
now  you all seem
like good folk 
and good folk know better than
to take what isn t theirs 
and this   
this is mine 
so  i m going to ask
one more time 
who was it 
who 
now  you make sure
he gets this message 
either he meets me outside in the
main thoroughfare at noon tomorrow
or i start killing more people 
all right 
albert  you gotta

haven t you  albert 
you ve been with my wife 
well  we haven t
actually done it 
if that makes any
kind of a difference 
okay  look  look  look 
here s my idea  okay 
you re a pretty tough guy  yeah 
why don t you prove it 
gunfight  you and me 
right here  right now 
you really do have
a death wish  don t you 
yeah  i guess you ll
have to find that out 
take out your gun 
point it at me 
no 
good boy 
now  we shoot on three 
one 
i ve been playing
cards a long time
and i would never
have bet on that  stark 
where d you learn to shoot 
your wife 
snap 
holy fuck 
okay  look  look  look 
before you kill me 
just grant me a few
last words  all right 
make it quick 
let anna live 
all right 
let her live 
this is not her fault 
i kissed her  she didn t
kiss me  all right 
it s not her fault 
i mean  she didn t
tell me she was married 
so it s a little bit
her fault  i guess 
so  yeah  i guess
that s kind of true 
so  maybe just
shoot her in the arm 
what the   
and one more thing 
um  my grandparents were arabic 
so  i m required
by muslim tradition
to recite the islamic death
chant immediately before dying 
this will only take a moment 
hey  what s the matter  clinch 
you not feeling well 
you okay  boss 
what s happening to me 
you know  there are a million
ways to die in the west  clinch 
there s  famine 
disease  gunfights 
and  wild animals 
you know  like snakes 
and  you know 
the funny thing is 
you don t even
have to get bitten 
all you need is
a little bit of the venom
introduced into your bloodstream
and you re pretty much screwed 
for example  if you drain
a certain amount of venom
from the fangs of a diamondback
rattler into a hollow tip bullet 
you really only need one shot 
now  i knew my aim wasn t good enough
to hit you anywhere important 
but if  caught
you by surprise   
well  anna taught me just enough
to get me in the ballpark 
and just a small amount
of venom in an open wound
is enough to kill
a man if he s   
albert 
he s dead 
you did it 
yeah 
did he hear all
that smart stuff i did 
no  no 
i don t think so 
well  it was still good  though 
yeah  it was great 
i thought it was really good 
stop 
albert 
i m really horny right now 
let s go in the shade and fuck 
well done  sheep boy 
hey  sorry
i killed your husband 
god  that was never
gonna work out anyway 
he s methodist 
i m half jewish 
are you  you are  no 
thank god 
you re not really
arabic  are you 
no  no  no 
thank god  because
i was like   kill me  
i know  right 
 no  my god  
  no  we re fine  we re okay 
  albert 
hey  louise 
hey  listen 
if you want to   
if you want to talk about
things  i would like that 
i mean  i could come by your
place  like  later tonight 
you know  louise  i would 
but i really gotta go
home and work on myself 
so  you killed
clinch leatherwood 
the deadliest gunman
on the frontier

you know  there s probably
gonna be some reward money 
you know 
i didn t think about that 
what are you gonna do

who wants to take a gander
