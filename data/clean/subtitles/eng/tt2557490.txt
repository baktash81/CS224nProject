frontier in 1882
a hard land for hard folk
food was scarce
disease was rampant
and life was a daily
struggle for survival
hell this was
miss america in 1880
holy shit
to build a home and a life in
this harsh unforgiving country
required that a man be bold
fearless and tough as iron
the men who were
courageous and resilient
were the men who prospered
but some men were
just big giant pussies
well well
surprised you showed up stark
yeah well you said
you would kill my family
and burn my house down
if i didnt so
draw
is there anything
at all that i can say
to get you to call this off
you yellow stark
okay well thats a little
racist to our hardworking friends
over here from the far
east right guys
draw you son of a bitch
look i just feel like if we
can talk this out you know
we can find a calm
rational solution
and maybe we even
laugh about it one day
i aint in the mood
to laugh stark
look theres
always humor in any
hey look this will make you laugh
look at our shadows
it looks like our shadows are
about to kiss each other
look at that
wait watch this my god charlie
my god
thank you this is
so generous of you
wow this is
what a terrific guy you are
we barely know each other but hey
when its right its right
ill give you a little tap on the
hat when im good to go okay

fighting about
i cant remember
can you
your goddamn sheep grazed
up half my ranch stark
that grass aint
never gonna grow back
all right look
how about this
ill pay you the money
you lost okay
just give me two days
to sell off
a few of my sheep
and ill get you the money
all right
just two days
if i dont have that cash
im coming after ya
okay great thank you so
much for your patience
i really appreciate it
and what a relief
for all these people
who came out here
hoping that we would
find an amicable
solution to this
aw somebody shoot some fucker
i took a halfday
off work for this
okay i just want to point out
that guys an english
teacher at our school
just a little taste
i mean that should
have been the end of it right
i mean i tell him
ill pay him off
we go our separate ways
and thats it
but no he shoots me
in the fucking leg
i mean its just a graze
but come on look at that
what
you should have fought him
i should have fought him
youre serious
louise my god the guy is one
of the best shots around
i look like i have parkinsons next to him
what is that
its just another way god
mysteriously shows that he loves us
but look it would have been
suicide to fight that guy
albert im breaking
up with you
what
yeah im sorry
i got shot today
i know
wait wait wait
hang on a sec
louise where is
this coming from
is this because of the gunfight

i realized that
i want something else
something else louise its
been a year and a half
look i know im just a sheep
farmer but im saving money
yeah but youre not even a
good sheep farmer albert
your sheep are everywhere
the one thing a sheep
farmer has to do
is keep all of his sheep
in one place all right
i went to your farm
the other day
and i saw one in the backyard
three way up on the ridge
two in the pond
and one on the roof
okay thats bridget all right
she has a problem with retardation
but shes full of love
look were getting off
track here all right
why dont you just tell
me what the problem is
and then maybe i can fix it
maybe if i were older
the timing would be right
but people are living
to be 35 these days

have to just go off
and get married right away
i just i have to
i have to work on myself

i almost wish you could
smile in photographs
louise has such
an amazing smile
thatd be weird
have you ever smiled
in a photograph
no have you
god no
no youd look like
an insane person
but its just you know
ive been sitting here
trying to figure
out how the hell
i could have screwed this up
i did everything for her
if she was happy i was happy
thats all i cared about
and she was the one
thing that made the shootings
and the diseases and the wild
animals and the indians
and the general depressing
awfulness about the west
bearable
god i love her so much
youre gonna make me cry
lets get fucked up
yeah
so what are you gonna do
i dont know what im gonna do
commit suicide maybe
albert i know everything
seems hopeless right now
but i promise you theres
so much to live for
really is there
what is there to live for on
the frontier in 1882
look let me tell you something
we live in a terrible
place and time
the american west is a disgusting
awful dirty dangerous place
look around you
everything out here thats
not you wants to kill you
outlaws angry drunk people
scorned hookers hungry animals
diseases major and minor
injuries indians the weather
you can get killed just
going to the bathroom
i take my life in my hands every
time i walk out to my outhouse
theres fucking rattlesnakes
all in the grass out there
and even if i make it
you know what can kill me
cholera
you know cholera
the black shit
the black shit
the latest offering in the frontiers
diseaseofthemonth club
and even if you survive
all those things
you know what else can kill you
the fucking doctor
the doctor can kill you
i had a cold a couple of years ago
i went in there
you know what he said to me
he goes
you need
an ear nail
a nail in my fucking ear
that is modern medicine for you
yeah doc
i have a fever of 102
you need
a donkey kickin
you know our pastor has shot two people
our pastor
no no
no
honest to god
shot a guy in a duel
and then went back and
killed the guys teenage son
because he was afraid he would
kill him out of revenge
wait how do you know that
because he did a whole
fucking sermon about it
a lesson about
seeing things through
by the way look at this
see those guys over there
the guys who work in the silver mines
see what theyre eating
ribs doused in hot sauce
they eat hot spicy foods
every meal of the day
do you know why
because their palates are so
completely fucking dulled
from inhaling poisoned gas 12
hours a day down in the mines
thats all they can taste
you know what that kind of
diet does to your guts
constipation cramps
dyspepsia liver disease
kidney disease hemorrhoids
bowel inflammation
they literally die
from their own farts
and you want to see more death
all we got to do is get up
and walk out the front door
that is our mayor
he is dead
he has been lying there
dead for three days
no one has done a thing
not moved him
not looked into his death
not even replaced him
with a temporary appointee
for the last three days the
highestranking official in our town
has been a dead guy
look at that
look at that
wolves are dragging the body away
as if to illustrate my point
bye bye mr mayor
bye have fun becoming
wolf shit bye
god
that my friends
is the american west
a disgusting awful dirty cesspool
of despair and fuck all of it
why dont you shut up

a heartfelt prayer
to the family of james addison

how can i possibly
be this happy
she likes me now
but one day
she is gonna figure out
that she is
too good for me
and then one day she did
i feel like i finally tricked one
girl into falling in love with me
and then i lost her
i think you have this
whole thing upside down
i mean it sounds like youve bent
over backwards for this girl
but what has she given you back
i told you she allowed
me to be happy
in a part of the world that
is otherwise a living hell
allowed wow

you would use that word
you know that right
all i know is that there
is nothing for me out here
if i dont have her

i feel great when im with her
shes classy shes fun
shes insanely gorgeous
hey no look
shes really pretty yes
but honestly and im
sorry to say this
i dont see what else
shes got going for her
my impression was that she was a
little sour and selfabsorbed
and for a guy with
so much going for him
i just thought that maybe you
i dont know what you think
i have going for me but
you see
there you go again
just cutting yourself down
you act like this girl
was performing
some kind of a charitable
act by dating you
albert youre a catch
youre sweet youre
funny youre smart
youve made something
of yourself out here
you know a lot of
people cant say that
youre a good sheep farmer
my god please
i suck at sheep
louise was right
i cant keep track of them
there was a sheep in the
whorehouse last week
really
yeah
wandered in there and then
when i went to pick it up
somehow it had made 20
but you know thank you
anyway for what you said
look the west fucking sucks
but the frontier
is not your problem
its you
you need a little confidence
boost my friend
now aim up sheep boy
hey
there we go

so all i gotta do is get foy to let
me shoot 16 times before he shoots
and then i win
youre gonna do great
i promise
easy

one of anna barnes
very special
supersupersecret cookies

a pot cookie isnt it
its a pot cookie
no no no

with that stuff at all
its a pot cookie
yeah i know

my worst fear is to od
on a recreational drug
no thank you
on a pot cookie
the last time somebody
gave me one of these
i became convinced that prairie
dogs could read my mind
just take a little bit
ill take a very very small bite
just a small bite
a very small bite
thats it
are you kidding me
nope deadly serious
lets see what this does
and if i dont throw
myself off this cliff
during some awful
freakout then
just take that
little bit right there
well now youve touched it
take the other side
there you go
there
and now we just wait
for the sun to set
this is really weird
is it supposed to be like this
you gave me
the right amount right
you dont think i took too much
just ride it out
this is
wow my bones are
in really deep today
like theres a lot more
skin than there usually is
i think my body is padding
up for the winter
which is weird
because its not winter
but theres a lot more there
theres something wrong
with my swallowing
this is not how
i usually swallow
my god anna he knows
what what what
he knows what were doing
he knows what this is
he knows what this is
i dont wanna
no i dont wanna join
i dont wanna join up
suppertime you lazy prick
goddamn waste of lungs

hey
wow
you look amazing
and maybe
a little uncomfortable
shit
im totally overdressed
arent i

ive never done formal before
and the lady at the boutique
told me to buy this
and no one else is wearing this
who cares what
these are all fuckers
you look fantastic
i look like jane austen
threw up all over me
you do not look
like jane austen threw
no you look
absolutely beautiful
you can breathe
in that thing right
theres nothing i like more than
putting on some loose
baggy clothes
and just being able to relax
yeah this is an endoftheworkday
outfit you have on
im very glad i
remembered the six items
i somehow require
to hold up my pants
yeah
i like your bustle by the way
yeah
i really love that the most
alluring fashion statement
a woman can make today
is to simulate a fat ass
that is a simulation of a fat
ass right there thank you
if i was a black guy this is the
meanest trick you could play on me
because id be like
my god look
theres a fat ass
my favorite
and then id lift it up and id be
like shit its a big joke
i know exactly because
when you lift it up
theres nothing but
a metal cage under there
wow

the stress of the day
completely
well at the very least
this will be a good way
to spend my last
night alive right

traditional frontier dancing
fuck yes
you men who long for love
you mustnt all despair
theres a secret you should know
to capture
the hearts of the fair
you may not have the looks
you may not have the dash
but youll win yourself a girl
if youve only got a moustache
a moustache a moustache
if youve only got a moustache
you may be common folk
without a hint of pride
but you neednt be a king
to make any maiden a bride
you may not have the name
you may not have the cash
but youll make
that girl your own
if youve only got a moustache
a moustache
a moustache if youve
only got a moustache
you may be big and fat
or uglier than sin
all the ladies shut you out
youre wondering how to get in

for how to make a splash
you can have your pick of gals
if youve only got a moustache
a moustache a moustache
if youve only got a moustache

moustache a moustache
big moustache thick moustache
my moustache your moustache

ill be right back
your dicks out
hey
so albert and i
are gonna split

knowing that a woman
can outshoot you
if you dont mind
my girlfriend and i are
enjoying each others company
want to know the
real kicker though
i can outdrink you too
that i can assure you
is impossible
fifty cents to the winner
one
two
three
shit
dont feel bad
alcohol doesnt harmonize well with a
womans frail constitution anyway
i guess not
here you go
you can buy your
girlfriend a brain
excuse me
youre an idiot
you have the nicest guy in the world
throwing himself at your feet
and here you are with
this complete asshole
who i go out with
is my own business
so why dont you
mind your own bitch
how are you so blind
with eyes that big
enjoy your night
theyre not that big
no my dear theyre
practically chinese
god i love you
i love you too
hows that
ooh

thats true and theyre
all by stephen foster
yeah
um
hey you know whatever
happens tomorrow
i just i just want
to say thank you
i couldnt have gotten
this far without you
and this may be the booze talking
or your pep talk or both
but i think i can do it
you know
i think i can beat him
well ill tell you this you
sound a lot more confident
than that guy who dragged me out
of the saloon not too long ago
you know its funny
i still feel like i dont know
anything about you
after all this time
and i feel like every time i bring
it up you change the subject
there really isnt
that much to tell
my story is a lot
like yours i suppose
because ill tell you i hate the
west just as much as you do
do you really
for my own reasons but yeah
i like you even more now
there is something about
connecting over mutual hatred
thats just so much
deeper than mutual love
its true right
if two people hate the same
things it creates a bond
hate can move mountains
yes
hey you know what
before i forget
hey bridget bridget
yeah she knows come here there we go
my god
what is this
this is just a little
something to say thank you
albert
its nothing huge its just
okay dont get too excited
what is it what is it
what is it
holy shit
i know right
hes smiling
yeah
no in the picture
hes smiling
isnt that amazing
i bought that off a peddler who was
coming through town last week
this is the guy i was
telling you about
i didnt even know this existed
and apparently hes not insane
bullshit
thats what the guy told me
it takes 30 seconds
to take a photograph
this guy would
have had to sit there
and smile for 30
sustained seconds
i know ive never been happy for
30 seconds in a row in my life
no one has
its the fucking west
hes gotta be insane
who the fuck knows
this is incredibly sweet
its nothing its
i owe you
no ones ever done
anything like this for me
come on now
thank you
im sorry
i i shouldnt
have done that
no its its fine

friend to me thats all

id be branded a coward
baby if you fight him
tomorrow you will kill him
yes thats what
happens in a gunfight
but hes not a bad guy foy
i mean yeah
hes kind of a loser
and he always smells like sheep
but he doesnt
deserve to be shot
louise
my decision is final

somewhere along the line

relationship is a twoway street

your life with a pussy full of hair
i say go with god

havent you albert
youve been with my wife
well we havent

if that makes any
kind of a difference
okay look look look
heres my idea okay
youre a pretty tough guy yeah
why dont you prove it
gunfight you and me
right here right now
you really do have
a death wish dont you
yeah i guess youll
have to find that out
take out your gun
point it at me
no
good boy
now we shoot on three
one
ive been playing
cards a long time
and i would never
have bet on that stark
whered you learn to shoot
your wife
snap
holy fuck
okay look look look
before you kill me
just grant me a few
last words all right
make it quick
let anna live
all right
let her live
this is not her fault
i kissed her she didnt
kiss me all right
its not her fault
i mean she didnt
tell me she was married
so its a little bit
her fault i guess
so yeah i guess
thats kind of true
so maybe just
shoot her in the arm
what the
and one more thing
um my grandparents were arabic
so im required
by muslim tradition
to recite the islamic death
chant immediately before dying
this will only take a moment
hey whats the matter clinch
you not feeling well
you okay boss
whats happening to me
you know there are a million
ways to die in the west clinch
theres famine
disease gunfights
and wild animals
you know like snakes
and you know
the funny thing is
you dont even
have to get bitten
all you need is
a little bit of the venom
introduced into your bloodstream
and youre pretty much screwed
for example if you drain
a certain amount of venom
from the fangs of a diamondback
rattler into a hollowtip bullet
you really only need one shot
now i knew my aim wasnt good enough
to hit you anywhere important
but if caught
you by surprise
well anna taught me just enough
to get me in the ballpark
and just a small amount
of venom in an open wound
is enough to kill
a man if hes
albert
hes dead
you did it
yeah
did he hear all
that smart stuff i did
no no
i dont think so
well it was still good though
yeah it was great
i thought it was really good
stop
albert
im really horny right now
lets go in the shade and fuck
well done sheep boy
hey sorry
i killed your husband
god that was never
gonna work out anyway
hes methodist
im halfjewish
are you you are no

arabic are you

thank god because
i was like kill me
i know right
no my god

if you want to talk about
things i would like that

but i really gotta go
home and work on myself
so you killed
clinch leatherwood
the deadliest gunman
on the frontier
