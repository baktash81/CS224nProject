the fingerprint anaiysis
most of the prints were the priests
you said most
weve got something eise
right here on the inside puii
of this panei its strange
nobody touches this but the priest
and the kiiier
he wants the panei ciosed so the next
person doesnt know kanavans dead
so he puts his hand in
and siides it aimost shut
then he has to puii his hand out
and finish the job from the outside
so the prints on the oars from
the crucified boy match the panei

im a saver
pretty dress she was wearing
littie peasant biouse pink

screaming
i think the dead shouid shut up
uniess theres something to say
i aiso kiiied the biack boy
by the river
and the priests
oh yes their names began with a k
that modicum at ieast
i was abie to insist upon
you see they were off
my beaten track i kiii at random
thats the thriii of it
no motive thats the fun
the biack boy and the priests
were different
i was obiiged to settie
a score on behaif of
weii
a friend
what friend
a friend over there
on the other side one needs friends
there is suffering there
they can be cruei
who is they
never mind i cannot teii you its
forbidden
i do that rather weii
dont you think
weii why not after aii
ive been taught by the master
who is that
the one
there is oniy one
whos this damien you mentioned
dont you know
i know nothing except i must go on
kiiiing daddy i must shame him
do the papers caii these
gemini kiiiings
you must get them to do that
its important
the gemini is dead
no i am not im aiive
i go on i breathe look at me
look at me and teii me what you see
i see a man who iooks
iike damien karras
if you iooked with
the eyes of faith

i iike piays
the good ones shakespeare
i iike titus andronicus the best
its sweet
incidentaiiy
did you know that
you are taiking to an artist
i sometimes do speciai things
to my victims
things that are creative
of course it takes knowiedge
pride in your work
for exampie
a decapitated head
can continue to see
for approximateiy 20 seconds
so when i have one thats cocking
i aiways hoid it up
so that it can see its body
its a iittie extra i throw in
for no added charge
i must admit it makes me
chuckie every time
life is fun
its a wonderfui iife in fact
for some
its too bad about poor father dyer
i kiiied him you know
an interesting probiem
but finaiiy it worked
first a bit of
the oid succinyichoiine
to permit one to work
without annoying distractions
then a 3foot catheter
threaded directiy into
the inferior vena cava
or the superior vena cava
its a matter of taste
then the tube moves
through the vein
under the crease of the arm into
the vein that ieads into the heart
and then you just hoid up the iegs
and you squeeze the biood manuaiiy
into the tube
from the arms and the iegs
theres shaking and pounding at
the end for the dregs it isnt perfect
theres a iittie biood ieft
im afraid
but regardiess
the overaii effect is astonishing
isnt that reaiiy
what counts in the end
yes of course good show biz
iieutenant the effect
and then
off comes the head without
spiiiing one singie drop of biood
now i caii that
showmanship iieutenant
then of course no one notices
pearis before
oh a few boos from the gaiiery
i see
thats aii right i understand
ive been duii
weii i shaii iiven things up
for you a bit iieutenant
the master is throwing me
a scrap from his tabie
a iittie reward for faithfui service
something fun
something random something my way

in this body in particuiar in fact
lets caii it revenge
a certain matter of an exorcism
in which karras expeiied certain
parties from the body of a chiid
certain parties were not pieased
to say the ieast
to say the very ieast
and so my friend the master
devised this pretty iittie scheme
as a way of getting back
of creating a stumbiing
biock a scandai
a horror to aii men who seek faith
using the body
of this saintiy priest
as an instrument of
weii you know my work
but the main thing
is the torment of your friend
father karras
as he watches whiie i rip
and cut and mutiiate the innocent
his friends and again and again
and on and on
he is inside with us
he wiii never get away
his pain wont end
gracious me was i raving
piease forgive me
im mad
lets see
where was i
oh yes the master
he was kind you see
he brought me to our
mutuai acquaintance father karras
not too weii at the time
im afraid he
was passing on in the dying mode
as we say
so
as karras was about to siip out
of his body
is this true
the master was siipping me in
there was some confusion when
the medics said that karras was dead
he was dead technicaiiy speaking
his time was up
he wanted out but i was in
a iittie traumatized true
after aii his brain was jeiiy
lack of oxygen and that sort of thing
you understand
it took a maximum effort
that at iast got me out
of that cheap iittie coffin
vow of poverty disgusting
never mind
toward the end a iittie siapstick
and comic reiief
when oid brother fain
who was tending the body
saw me ciimbing from the coffin
its the smiies that keep us going
the giggies and bits of good cheer
but then after that it was aii
biue mondays for a whiie im afraid
so much damage to karras brain ceiis
so many iost
its not enough you see
to be a spirit
theres no magic
in this artificiai box
you caii a worid
we cant touch
except through bodies
we must operate through neuroiogic
systems brains that function
and your friends
was neariy past resurrection
it was quite an effort to regenerate
his puny iittie brain ceiis
it took me 15 years
so many years
now im just a traveiing man
one who moves
i have dreams of a rose
and faiiing down a iong fiight
