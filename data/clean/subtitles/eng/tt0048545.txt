maybe you get back
at your dad that way 
if you re not as close to him

   and immensity of our universe 
for many days
before the end of our earth   
   people will look
into the night sky and notice a star   
   increasingly bright
and increasingly near 
as this star approaches us   
jim stark 
i ll go find a place  i m sorry 
as this star approaches us 
the weather will change 
the great polar fields of the north
and south will rot and divide 
and the seas will turn warmer 
the last of us search the heavens
and stand amazed 
for the stars will still be there   
   moving through their ancient rhythms 
the familiar constellations
that illuminate our night   
   will seem as they have always seemed 
eternal  unchanged and little moved   
   by the shortness of time
between our planet s birth and demise 
orion  the hunter 
one of ptolemy s constellations 
and the most brilliant in the heavens 
boy 
what 
i was just thinking that   
   once you ve been up there
you know you been some place 
gesundheit 
they re almost equal in brilliancy 
cancer  the crab   
   containing a large 
loose cluster of stars   
   called praesepe or the beehive 
i m a crab 
the sun can be vertically overhead 
taurus  the bull

i don t want to make friends 
while the flash
of our beginning has not yet traveled   
   the light years into distance   
   has not yet been seen by planets
deep within the other galaxies   
   we will disappear into the blackness
of the space from which we came   
   destroyed as we began 
in a burst of gas and fire 
the heavens are still
and cold once more 
in all the immensity of our universe
and the galaxies beyond   
   the earth will not be missed 
through the infinite reaches of space   
   the problems of man seem
trivial and naive indeed 
and man  existing alone   
   seems himself an episode
of little consequence 
that s all
