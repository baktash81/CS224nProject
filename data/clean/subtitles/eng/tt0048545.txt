and immensity of our universe
for many days
before the end of our earth
people will look
into the night sky and notice a star
increasingly bright
and increasingly near
as this star approaches us
jim stark
ill go find a place im sorry
as this star approaches us
the weather will change
the great polar fields of the north
and south will rot and divide
and the seas will turn warmer
the last of us search the heavens
and stand amazed
for the stars will still be there
moving through their ancient rhythms
the familiar constellations
that illuminate our night
will seem as they have always seemed
eternal unchanged and little moved
by the shortness of time
between our planets birth and demise
orion the hunter
one of ptolemys constellations
and the most brilliant in the heavens
boy
what
i was just thinking that
once youve been up there
you know you been some place
gesundheit
theyre almost equal in brilliancy
cancer the crab
containing a large
loose cluster of stars
called praesepe or the beehive
im a crab
the sun can be vertically overhead
taurus the bull

its hard to make friends with these guys
i dont want to make friends
while the flash
of our beginning has not yet traveled
the light years into distance
has not yet been seen by planets
deep within the other galaxies
we will disappear into the blackness
of the space from which we came
destroyed as we began
in a burst of gas and fire
the heavens are still
and cold once more
in all the immensity of our universe
and the galaxies beyond
the earth will not be missed
through the infinite reaches of space
the problems of man seem
trivial and naive indeed
and man existing alone
seems himself an episode
of little consequence
thats all
