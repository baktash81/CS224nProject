bonnet  get back in bed
this minute or i ll report you 
and you quiet down 
  are your parents coming 
  the whole family 
aren t you dressing up 
no visitors 
what the hell is it to you 
my message today is especially
for the youngest among you
who will be confirmed in a few weeks 
my children 
we live in a time of discord and hatred 
lies are all powerful 
christians kill one another 
those who should guide us betray 
us instead 
more than ever  we must beware
of selfishness and indifference 
you re all from wealthy families 
some very wealthy 
because you ve been given much 
much will be asked of you 
remember the bible s stern lesson 
 it s easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven  
st  james said 
 now  you rich  weep and wail
for the woes awaiting you  
your wealth has rotted 
and your garments are eaten by worms  
worldly wealth corrupts souls
and withers hearts 
it makes men contemptuous  unjust 
pitiless in their egoism 
i understand the anger
of those who have nothing
when the rich feast so arrogantly 
he s hitting pretty hard 
i don t mean to shock you
but only remind you
that charity is a christian s first duty 
st  paul tells us in today s epistle 
 brothers  be not wise in your 
own conceits 
do not repay any man evil for evil 
if thine enemy hunger  feed him 
if he thirst  give him drink  
let us pray for the hungry 
for those who suffer 
for the persecuted 
let us pray for the victims
and for their executioners as well 
  will you give concerts 
  not right away 
i still need practice 
it s hard to get started 
it s duvallier s dog 
  it ll bite you 
  he doesn t bite 
en garde  easter bonnet

she swiftly cast aside her veils 
removed her clothing 
and appeared naked as the day she 
was born 
blessed be the womb that bore her 
the princess was
as soft and white as fine linen 
her whole being
exuded a scent of amber 
he took her in his arms 
probing her intimate depths 
and found she was a virgin pearl 
his hand roved
over her lovely limbs and neck
and through the richness of her hair 
she responded by eagerly displaying
her many gifts 
she had the sinuous grace of araby 
ethiopian ardor 
the startled candor of the french 
the high art of the indians 
yemeni coyness 
and the narrow passage of a 
chinese girl 
each embrace became a coupling 
and each coupling
the wildest fornication 
until  weary from
their passionate writhings 
they fell asleep in each other s arms 
drunk with pleasure 
thus ended    
the russians have begun
a major offensive in the ukraine 
british radio claims
the germans have been overrun
along a 60 mile front west of kiev 
radio paris claims the attack was repulsed
with heavy losses 
the truth is likely
somewhere between the two 
radio paris tells german lies
meanwhile  in italy 
the americans and british
are pinned down at monte cassino
