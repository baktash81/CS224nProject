sparta will fall 
all of greece will fall 
 yelling 
and persian fire will reduce athens to cinder 
for athens is a pile of stone and wood   
   and cloth and dust   
   and  as dust  will vanish into the wind 
only the athenians themselves exist 
and the fate of the world hangs
on their every syllable 
only the athenians exist 
and only stout wooden ships can save them 
wooden ships   
   and a tidal wave of heroes  blood 
leonidas  my husband   
   leonidas  your king   
   leonidas and the brave 300 are dead 
the free men and women of greece   
   are not bound by
a beautiful spartan death 
war is not their love 
yet he lay down his life for them 
for the promise greece holds 
 tis our enemies who forged our freedom
in the fires of war 
it was king darius
who came to take our land 
ten years ago 
when youth still burned in our eyes   
   before this bitter war forced our children
to become men 
ten years ago  this war began   
   as all wars begin 
with a grievance 
marathon 
the persian king  darius   
   annoyed by the notion of greek freedom   
   has come to greece to bring us to heel 
he makes landfall at the field of marathon   
   with an invading force
which outnumbers   
   the greek defenders three to one 
and so at dawn  the hopeless athenians
do the unthinkable 
they attack 
they attack the weary persians
as they disembark   
   their ships
on shaky legs after a month at sea 
they attack before they can
establish their war camp   
   and supply their soldiers 
and who   
   is the architect of this mad strategy 
a little known athenian   
   soldier 
his men call him   
   themistokles 
he gives the persians a taste
of athenian shock combat 
 themistokles yells 
 all yelling and grunting 
 horses neighing 
 horse neighing 
 all shouting indistinctly 
 yells 
 yells 
gorgo  all thoughts of glory are gone 
thousands dead 
hundreds of them their own 
all for an idea  a free greece   
   an athenian experiment
called  democracy  
could this idea be worth it 
worth all this sacrifice 
themistokles would let
the good king darius decide 
for through the chaos   
   a moment appeared 
and themistokles would seize it 
a moment   
   that would ring across the centuries 
a moment that would   
   raise him from simple soldier   
   to the height of athenian political power 
no 
a moment that would make
themistokles a legend 
yet even as the praise and glory   
   were heaped upon him   
themistokles knew in his heart
he had made a mistake 
it was darius  son  xerxes   
   whose eyes had the stink
of destiny about them 
themistokles knew
he should have killed that boy 
that glorious mistake
would forever haunt him 
and so it was themistokles himself   
   who sent a ripple
across the persian empire   
   and set into motion   
   forces that would bring fire
to the heart of greece 
for as the good king lay dying   
   all his greatest generals   
   and advisors
were summoned to his bedside 
none greater   
   than his finest
naval commander  artemisia 
her ferocity bested only by her beauty 
her beauty matched only
by her devotion to her king 
darius favored artemisia
among his generals   
   for she had brought him victory
on the battlefield 
in her   
   he had the perfect warrior protégée   
   that his son  xerxes  would never be 
darius   in strained voice 
so sweet  my child 
my sweet   
   child 
xerxes  father 
xerxes 
do not repeat your father s mistake 
leave the ignoble greeks to their ways 
only the gods can defeat them 
only the gods 
gorgo  for seven days  xerxes mourned   
   paralyzed by grief 
on the eighth day  artemisia
whispered the seed of madness   
   that would consume him 
 whispering 
your father s words were not a warning   
   but a challenge 
only the gods can defeat the greeks 
you will be a god king 
gorgo  artemisia gathered the priests  wizards   
   and mystics
from every corner of the empire 
they wrapped   
   the young king in cimmerian gauze
dipped in ancient potions   
   and set him to wander the desert   
   till in a delirium of heat and thirst 
he stumbled upon   
   a hermit s cave 
xerxes passed the vacant eyes   
   and empty souls   
   of the hollow creatures that dwell
in the dark corners of all men s hearts 
and in that darkness   
   he surrendered himself completely   
   to power so evil and perverse   
   that  as he emerged   
   no part of a human man
that was xerxes survived 
his eyes blazed like scarlet coals 
he was stripped  cleansed  glabrous   
   and smooth 
xerxes was reborn   
   a god 
artemisia trusted no one 
so in the cover of night   
   the palace was cleansed
of all xerxes  allies 
all those he trusted   
   all those who had raised him   
   all those he had
once looked to for counsel   
   were quickly introduced to her wrath 
 crowd cheering 
and as the god king stood   
   before his people   
   artemisia watched her flawless
manipulation take shape 
  for glory s sake   
artemisia   whispering  for glory s sake   
   for vengeance s sake   
   for vengeance s sake   
   war 
   war 
 crowd cheering 
gorgo  war is coming to greece   
   in the visage of a monster army
over a million strong 
it should be little more than a formality
for themistokles   
   the hero of marathon   
   to finish what he began 
please  we must appeal to xerxes  reason 
man 1  coward 
athens is a city of cowards 
shut your cock hole 
shut your own 
i ll kill you  fuck the spartans 
fuck those muscle bound boy lovers 
silence 
man 2  silence for the hero of marathon 
themistokles  this is a democracy  not a street fight 
man 3  quiet  it s themistokles 
the persian attack will come
from both the north and the south 
the city states should negotiate a truce 
yes  yes  we must negotiate 
themistokles  negotiate with tyranny 
give me one example of when
that has ever profited a nation 
man 4  you re right  we must unite 
themistokles  my fellow countrymen   
   we can only judge the future   
   from what we have suffered in the past 
now  many of you here
stood with me at marathon 
and for those of you who served   
   and faced the cut
and thrust of battle   
   you know how true peace is forged 
do not be deceived 
xerxes  the son of darius   
   is a wolf at our door 
right here  right now   
   we must choose 
do we stand and fight for greece or not 
argos   
   corinth   
   megara   
   athens 
not even sparta
can match the persians alone 
we must persevere as one nation 
or we will perish clinging onto   
   our own self interests 
send us the ships that we need
to defend greece 
themistokles will need more
than our cities  ships 
he will need our children
to join the fight 
 crowd murmurs 
and what of sparta 
you send every ship that we have   
   to the northern coast of euboea 
i will go and seek the help
of the great spartans 
 crowd murmuring 
artemisia  still no word   
   from the messenger
you sent to sparta 
king leonidas may have been insulted
by your generous offer 
perhaps i need to march into sparta myself
and burn it to the ground 
remember   
   when a king is loved as i am   
   much can be accomplished 
they would be fools
to resist my divine power 
athens is attempting to assemble a coalition 
it ll be nothing more
than a patchwork of ships 
once these waters have been traversed 
i will lead my force across the land 
i will remind the cowards of greece   
   that we have not forgotten their insolence 
rest and water the horses 
it s best i go alone 
spartans don t get along well with others 
 grunting 
 men grunting in unison 
 groans 
  spartans 
dilios  themistokles 
you old snake 
  what brings you this far south 
  i ve come to see leonidas 
  to warn him that the persians are on the march 
  you re too late 
persian messenger already presented
his terms to leonidas 
symbolic offering of earth and water 
spartans 
know this and know it well 
 coughs 
that any spartan s finest moment   
   the greatest fulfillment   
   of all he holds dear   
   is that moment   
   when he has fought his heart out   
   for the preservation of sparta   
   and lies dead on the battlefield   
   victorious 
now   
   who is willing to die at our king s side 
men   in unison 
ah ooh 
ah ooh  ah ooh 
gorgo  themistokles 
you ve come a long way to stroke your cock
whilst watching real men train 
themistokles  queen gorgo 
shouldn t he be training them
to live at their king s side 
themistokles  a new age is dawning  gorgo 
won t be long before men rise up
and shed the yoke of mysticism and tyranny 
  that sounds like a threat 
  no 
an opportunity to join the rest of free greece
and stand against a true tyrant 
unless  of course  you and leonidas
have already made a deal with xerxes 
no terms were reached 
xerxes  messenger was   
well  he was rude and he lacked respect 
he didn t understand the same threats made
in thebes and athens would not work here 
this is the birthplace
of the world s greatest warriors 
men whose king would stand
and fight and die for any one of them 
xerxes  messenger   
   did not understand
this is no typical greek city state 
this is sparta 
it was clear to the messenger
there d be no spartan submission 
it was clear 
even now leonidas is in counsel
with the oracle over his battle plan 
the festival of the carneia
is all that stands in our way 
surely the oracle will see we must fight 
well  then my timing is perfect 
i am commanding a fleet of ships
that will represent a united greece 
i need sparta to join me 
give me your ships  gorgo 
i ll make sure that xerxes wishes
he never crossed the aegean 
you ll receive no spartan ships 
we ve no interest in a united greece 
that is your dream  themistokles  not ours 
all i am concerned with
is the preservation   
   of sparta 
my guards will see you out 
it s funny that you mock freedom   
   here in your selfish isolation 
yet freedom  in her wisdom   
   has chosen you to defend her 
my queen 
aeskylos  will sparta join our fight 
apparently the persians have offered
the spartans something they cannot refuse 
and what is that 
a beautiful death 
they say you are the bravest
of our captives 
they say you are a whore
from the eastern seas 
you re not the smartest 
your commander is a greek 
just like me 
you persian men take your orders
from a greek woman 
yes  my brother  i am greek by birth   
   and i have greek blood
running through my veins 
but my heart   
   is persian 
 thunder crashing 
artemisia  within hours   
   the greek fleet will be shattered 
what of our master
and the much feared spartans 
artemisia  there s nothing to fear 
only king leonidas
and his personal guard of 300   
   have marched to fight 
they ll collapse  instantly 
you 
do you agree 
many will perish 
your confidence leaves me
with a strong impression 
it s a curious thing for a simple ship guard   
   to not lower his eyes
when questioned by me 
that could ve been just a lack of discipline 
but a man s hands do not lie 
they can reveal   
   every imperfection
and flaw in his character 
you see  your hands
are not rough enough   
   to work the rigging of this ship 
i know every single man beneath my lash 
can you explain to me
how i don t know you 
forgive me  commander 
let me introduce myself 
seize the spy 
 grunting 
 yells 
coward 
storm is upon us 
it s just some mad greek weather 
 knocking on door 
scyllias  themistokles 
  come 
calisto 
what is spoken here must not be repeated 
anywhere 
my son has not earned the right
to sit at the table of combat veterans 
  but you can trust him 
themistokles  very well 
  tell me 
  a greek woman   
   commands all of xerxes  ships
to the south 
artemisia 
i know of her 
artemisia is murderous by trade
with true skill on the sea   
   and she has thirst for vengeance 
rumors are her entire family   
   was murdered
by a squad of greek hoplites 
i have heard all the stories 
and the hoplites spared no one on that day 
 woman screaming 
themistokles  the story goes
that they raped and murdered   
   her entire family 
and then they turned their attention
towards her 
after years of being kept in the bowels
of a greek slave ship   
   she was discarded and left for dead   
   where she was found near death
by a persian emissary 
artemisia vowed that day
to return to greece   
   only when she could watch it burn 
 grunting 
she was fed  clothed  trained
by the finest warriors of the persian empire   
   until no match could be found   
   for her skills and gift with the sword 
the great king darius was impressed
by her commitment 
and she quickly rose to command
at his side 
aeskylos  she has sold her soul   
   to death himself 
well  some could say
that i ve sold mine to greece 
and what do you think 
  me 
themistokles  yes 
you are the future of this country 
i m ready to fight 
 themistokles chuckles 
i like him  he reminds me of you 
aeskylos  we will need   
   every last man 
he is still just a boy 
much younger   
     have defended our country 
  enough 
you are a dreamer
and will speak of this no more 
themistokles  i ve set your plan in motion 
and my land force
will be assembled by the second day 
you will be needed 
i can assure you of that 
and there is bad news 
leonidas has marched north
to the hot gates 
aeskylos  bad news  with the spartans   
     at the hot gates  our victory is assured 
scyllias  if the army were with him 
but between the oracle and the carneia   
   leonidas has marched to thermopylae
with just 300 men 
aeskylos  so the only thing standing between athens   
   and total annihilation   
   is leonidas and 300 spartans 
aeskylos  i will search out the veterans among them 
  establish some order among the volunteers 
themistokles  good 
there s little time
to teach these farmhands strategy 
just keep them well fed   
   and sober 
aeskylos  anything else 
wouldn t hurt if they could
swing a sword 
well  i ll be damned 
shit 
  does your father know that you re here 
  no  sir 
and this shield and sword 
my grandfather s 
my mother entrusted them to me
this morning 
  when she gave you her blessing 
calisto  yes  sir 
with a sharp blade  no less 
your father is preparing a surprise
for our enemy tomorrow 
i choose to fight here  now 
come aboard my ship 
that is where you will fight 
yes  sir 
commander 1  we ve just over 50 ships 
persian forces reported a number
in the thousands 
  those ships appear hardly seaworthy 
commander 1  nothing like the monster ships   
     of the persian fleet 
  we have the advantage  speed  maneuverability 
the rest of the city states have sent
anywhere from a handful to a single ship 
  of course  athens supplied the balance 
commander 2  we have report   
   a small advance force of persian ships have
taken refuge from the storm across the strait 
if the weather breaks 
we could hit them at dawn 
an early greek victory 
commander 1  the gods have given us an opportunity   
   to wound the persians 
strengthen greek morale 
a tempting distraction 
but we ll stick to the battle plan 
today at sundown  we will sail out
to meet the main persian fleet 
we ll attack in the open water
with no shore to narrow the battle 
commander 2  to attack a force of over 1000 ships   
   with our meager force is suicide 
such is my plan 
artaphernes  look at their excuse for a navy 
artemisia  their ships are of little threat 
i need a second in command  artaphernes 
and whoever proves their excellence
will earn a place beside me 
general bandari has offered
to lead the first attack 
bandari 
commander 
if i let you lead our first offensive   
   what guarantee do i have
that you ll bring me a quick victory 
bandari  my word and my life 
good 
my rules of engagement 
humiliate the greeks
and lay waste to their tiny ships 
bandari  they ll be dead to the last man 
themistokles  my brothers 
steady your hearts 
look deep into your souls 
for your mettle is to be tested this day 
if in the heat of battle   
you need a reason to fight on   
   an idea for which you will give up   
   all that you will ever have   
   you need only to look at the man
who fights at your side 
this is the  why  of battle 
this is the brotherhood of men at arms 
an unbreakable bond   
   made stronger by the crucible of combat 
you will never be closer than with those
who you shed your blood with 
for there is no nobler cause   
   than to fight for those
who will lay down their life for you 
so you fight strong today 
you fight for your brothers 
fight for your families 
most of all  you fight for greece 
all  greece 
 all shout 
yeah 
and there is only one thing to make sure of
when the fighting starts 
what s that 
don t get killed on the first day 
 men laugh 
that goes for the rest of you 
persian ships   
   are strong at the front 
but they are weak   
   in the middle 
we attack them there 
now 
 grunting 
attack 
 yelling 
 screaming 
 yelling 
ram them 
commander  archers  now  now 
 all yell 
reverse 
now 
go through them 
 men yell 
 men screaming 
artemisia  the enemy s tactics   
   are creative 
the defensive circle
leaves no front to assault 
we are losing 
no  you are losing 
pull back 
let them have this day 
i m bored with your failures  bandari 
i ll not let this wound slow me 
heh  somehow i believe you 
my blade will be sharp and ready
by the morning 
good  tomorrow you will fight
alongside your father 
not bad   
     for a bunch of farmers 
  and poets and sculptors 
who d have known untrained men   
   would do so well against
such a considerable adversary 
we re going to need all of our strength
for tomorrow s fight 
how long do you think we can hold them 
if my plan is to work   
   long enough for the spartans
to unite greece 
men 
who will share their wine with me 
 men shout 
report 
we are still tallying the losses 
but you must understand 
it is extremely difficult   
   given the sea and the darkness   
   to get an accurate   
 grunts 
report 
artaphernes  seventy five ships lost 
thirty damaged beyond repair 
twenty could return with a few weeks  work
in a safe harbor 
the commander of the greek force
is named themistokles 
yes  he is an athenian general 
he s rumored to have loosed the arrow   
   that felled the great king darius himself 
no 
this themistokles has shown himself
to be quite brilliant in battle 
which is more than i can say for any of you 
do you gentlemen find my command
unreasonable 
is it too much to ask for victory 
your disappointment in yesterday s losses   
   is warranted 
my disappointment 
my disappointment is not with my losses 
the meager number of damaged ships
and dead slaves means nothing to me 
no  my disappointment   
   is in these men 
for though i stand   
   among 10 000   
   i am alone 
i long for a soul
who would stand by my side 
who i could trust 
tell me  general kashani 
are you that man 
you will taste your victory by the day s end 
i will make certain of it 
i hope so 
 all grunting 
advance 
now 
don t lose sight of them 
the greeks are retreating 
artemisia  he s got him right where he wants him 
kashani is a fine tactician 
i was speaking of themistokles 
rocks 
stop  stop 
stop 
brace yourselves 
 all yelling 
 yelling 
 yells 
 all yelling and grunting 
 sighs 
what are you doing here 
a man s responsibility
is to protect his family and his nation 
  who told you this 
  my father 
 groaning 
you see how themistokles
employs deception with such grace 
  why is it so much to ask for victory 
  how can i make amends 
silence 
you will carry a message for me 
man  now they will fear us 
now they will fear
the greek men at arms  hup 
themistokles  he s right 
fear the greek fighting man 
fear his sword 
his shield 
fear his love for mother greece 
but most of all   
   fear his freedom 
 all cheering 
don t be angry with the boy 
i took him under my command 
anger is something i reserve
for my enemies 
themistokles 
artemisia s ship is being anchored
in neutral waters 
she d like to meet with themistokles 
  how can you guarantee his safe return 
artaphernes  well  boy   
   the only honor for her now   
   will be when she watches
your crushed and broken fleet   
   sinking to the bottom of the aegean   
   and is able to recognize you   
   nailed to the mast of your ship
with her sword   
   as you descend to a watery grave 
why didn t you just say that to begin with 
artemisia  welcome to my humble barge 
we are honored by your presence 
your barge and you   
   are quite impressive 
kind words 
now come  themistokles 
we have much to discuss 
do you believe the greeks
are descended from the gods 
i have heard some say that 
and what of you 
is there a god in your lineage 
my men say so  and based on
the last two days  battle   
   i d say there s a spark of the divine in you 
now who s using kind words 
my men also say that it was you   
   who slayed the good king darius
at marathon 
many heroic deeds occurred on that day 
but it was 10 years ago   
   and the facts of battle
are often embellished 
this deed  you would remember 
i do what i must to defend greece 
and i do what i must to defeat her 
for every one greek killed 
you must kill a thousand persians 
for every ship i sink   
   you must sink a hundred 
i can sustain losses for weeks 
months  if need be 
my numbers will defeat you   
   and i will take your precious boats
with my sword 
i will take your greek freedom 
are you asking me
to negotiate a surrender 
no 
i offer you a chance
to avoid such misery and join me 
i m in need of a commander such as you 
look at the defense you ve mounted 
a handful of triremes 
leonidas with 300 spartans 
 chuckles 
it s insulting  frankly   
   that the mightiest empire the world
has ever seen is met by this 
i don t blame you  themistokles 
you fought as if the blood
of poseidon himself   
   was coursing through your veins 
no  i blame greece 
the squabbling bureaucrats
protecting their political hides   
   by sending you here to die 
and yet you still fight 
so there must be   
what 
family back home in athens
that compels you   
   to battle with such passion 
truth is  i ve had no time for family 
i have spent my entire adult life   
   with my one true love   
   the greek fleet   
   and my one passion   
   readying it for you 
 laughs 
now  that brings me pleasure   
   the thought of you pining away for me   
   forsaking family and love   
   for the promise of a deeper ecstasy 
the ecstasy of steel and flesh   
   death and life   
   of rage   
   and sweat of muscle   
   of pure joy   
   and deepest sorrow 
die with me each night and be born again
with me each morning   
   as you plant your sword
into the hearts of our enemies 
you fight for freedom 
i offer freedom without
consequence or responsibility 
join me   
   at my side 
breathe each breath with me
as if it were your last 
 panting 
 artemisia grunting 
 grunting 
 artemisia   themistokles
grunting 
 moans 
join me 
no 
 both grunting 
you re no god  you re just a man 
be quick with your sword 
you ll not have your death tonight 
guards 
remove this filth from my ship 
 yells then sword clangs 
aeskylos  well 
what have you learned 
 sighs 
can artemisia be beaten 
the next time that we face her   
   she s going to bring all of hell with her 
 sighs 
hold  hold 
send in my personal guard 
pull back 
retreat 
man  retreat 
scyllias  retreat 
man  retreat 
scyllias  retreat 
themistokles 
in the water 
archers on deck now 
scyllias  archers on deck now  quickly 
themistokles  starboard side 
fire at will 
 yelling 
 grunting 
 arrow pierces flesh 
 gasps 
fight on  boy 
uh huh 
scyllias  fight on 
 whooshing in distance 
 all yelling 
themistokles  aim for the men on top 
up there 
abandon ship  abandon ship 
abandon ship 
 grunts 
gorgo  the dead have no guilt 
no responsibility 
themistokles watches the bodies
of his men   
   turn the aegean red with blood 
were they sacrificed for his ego 
or to relieve the guilt of the long ago
mistake at marathon 
how many men would have been saved   
   if themistokles had killed that boy 
not even his own soul can be sure 
my friend 
we faced the odds 
 in strained voice  together 
listen to me   
   themistokles 
you will have to fight   
   with twice as much strength
in the morning 
we will fight shoulder to shoulder 
scyllias  no  my son 
you will carry on for both of us 
 scyllias whispering indistinctly 
 sobbing 
what did he say 
i will tell you in time  boy 
quiet now 
you go and be with your father s spirit 
how many times do you think
we will repeat such a tragedy 
as many times as we must 
we are turning young men into memories 
do you think i enjoy this 
witnessing my friend s final breath 
every widow that is made by my decision   
   every child that will grow
without a father   
   they are my choices 
this is the burden of my command 
 squawks 
xerxes  how easy it is to silence   
   the strong and self disciplined 
let my army witness
the great warriors of sparta 
march them past these corpses 
let them see the cost
of daring to challenge the god king 
king leonidas   
   and his brave 300
were the finest greece has to offer 
there will be no saviors   
   to rise up and vanquish us 
nothing will stop the march of my empire 
ephialtes  your majesty 
xerxes  you  take this dead king s sword   
   to athens 
let them know
that i am coming next for them 
let them know   
   athens   
   their prize jewel of a city   
   will disappear from the histories 
themistokles 
i bring word   
   from thermopylae 
leonidas was betrayed by a hunchback 
the spartans have been slaughtered 
the hot gates have fallen 
such a sacrifice 
now greece has her martyrs 
daxos  take that message   
   from the hot gates   
   to every city  every village 
let every countryman hear your words 
but they are dead  all of them 
sparta s sacrifice will be what unites us 
now go 
daxos  hyah 
move all of our ships and men back
to the safety of salamis 
and you 
i will take daxos  message to athens 
themistokles  i was told a hunchback
was accountable for the fall of the hot gates 
that he sold out his country   
   pulled the crimson from his back
and replaced it with persian gold 
what is your name  traitor 
ephialtes of trachis 
i should wet this noble blade
with your blood 
you would be right to do so 
there is little beauty about me 
there is little beauty in what i have done 
say what you must 
i beg of you   
   and all of athens 
the god king will burn this city
to the ground 
man  what does he mean 
themistokles  quiet yourselves 
leonidas  and sparta s great sacrifice
was no defeat 
it was a beautiful victory 
this simple act of valor   
   will allow us to rally each
of our city states   
   and unite greece   
   for one purpose   
   against one enemy 
and you 
you take this message to your god king 
that we will take whatever ships
we have left   
   and finish this in the bay of salamis 
but there will be death and destruction 
yes  there will be 
 thunder rumbling 
themistokles 
i m here to speak to your queen 
a warning  athenian 
you may not receive a warm welcome 
may i offer my deepest sympathies 
i cannot change what has happened
to leonidas   
   but his sacrifice will not be forgotten 
do not lecture me on sacrifice 
and be quick with your words  athenian 
i request of you the entire spartan navy 
every man  every ship   
     that you can spare 
  have i not given enough   
   for your dream of a united greece 
shall i put swords in the hands
of my son  our children 
would that please you 
have i not given enough
for your ambitions  themistokles 
a king 
husbands  fathers  brothers 
sparta will give no more 
this belongs with you 
avenge him 
gorgo  the oracle s words stood as a warning 
all of greece will fall   
   as persian fire reduces athens to cinder 
for athens is a pile of stone and wood   
   and cloth and dust   
   and  as dust  will vanish into the wind 
only the athenians themselves exist 
and the fate of the world
hangs on their every syllable 
only the athenians exist 
and only stout wooden ships can save them 
wooden ships   
   and a tidal wave of heroes  blood 
xerxes  the greeks were fools to stand against us 
leonidas and his pride   
   were no match for the will of a god 
themistokles was a worthless coward 
and now   
   this pathetic navy
is barely worth our attention 
if that worthless coward
had stood at my side   
   we would have laid the world   
   at your feet 
ephialtes  my king 
your humble servant brings you news 
the greek fleet are defenseless   
   within the bay of salamis 
you need only finish them 
who commands their forces 
themistokles of athens 
themistokles is dead 
ephialtes  he is alive  i have seen him myself 
artemisia  ready my troops and armor 
we will attack at once 
wisdom   
   would have us   
   send a probing force to confirm
it is not a trap 
you would dare to advise me
in matters of war 
i am the god king 
i am the one who triumphed over leonidas 
i am the one who laid waste   
   to this showpiece of athens 
  i am your king 
artemisia  killing leonidas and his men   
   only made them martyrs 
and when you razed athens   
   you set fire to the only thing   
   of value in this country 
i will attack the greeks   
   with my entire navy 
artemisia 
enough 
do not forget who put the crown
on your childish head 
my king 
now sit on your golden throne   
   and watch this battle
from the safety i provide you 
themistokles  there in the distance   
   we witness the destruction of athens 
alone  we will face the monster
that cast a shadow across our land 
i had prayed that the spartans
would come to lend a hand this morning 
perhaps they feel they have given enough 
commander 1  you failed us all 
this is your fault  themistokles 
without spartans  we re farmhands 
commander 2  we should ve negotiated
with the persians when we had the chance 
you are all right 
yes  we are down to a handful of boats 
and  yes  we are just farmhands 
we are tradesmen 
we are boys   
   turned to men through the sacrifice
and forge of combat 
i played a dangerous game   
   and i lost 
if you choose to turn your back on me   
   on your country   
   i will not judge you 
you are free to leave 
you are still free men 
very well 
then let us   
   put our shoulders to work
and free those ships from the bosom of greece 
today is a privilege to call our own 
a story that will be told
for a thousand years 
let our final stand   
   be recorded to the histories 
and let it be shown   
   that we chose to die on our feet   
   rather than live on our knees 
 all cheering 
there is only one thing
you need to know today 
not to get killed 
no  your father s last words 
he told me that you had earned
the right to sit at the table 
well  my brother 
i have no more tactics or tricks 
this will be the last battle that we share 
we have fought next to one other
for as long as i can remember 
nothing would please me more
than to rest this sword 
  the preparations that are required 
  below deck 
  good 
  are you sure   
   that you want to commit everything 
yes 
without artemisia s command 
the persian navy is nothing 
aeskylos  we will never be able to reach her 
themistokles  i will reach her   
   and put an end to this 
there will be no room for a retreat 
i know 
artemisia  today the last greek ships will be destroyed 
show them no mercy 
give them no quarter 
today we will dance across the backs
of dead greeks 
today we deliver submission 
today i want to feel themistokles  throat   
   beneath my boots 
 men yelling 
men  brace yourselves 
prepare for close quarters 
attack 
 men yelling 
your father watches you 
hold nothing back 
seize your glory 
 all grunting 
 yells 
i m not here as a witness 
 all yelling and grunting 
 man gasping 
now 
and let them send our souls straight to hell 
 horse neighing 
hyah  come on 
 themistokles yells 
you offered freedom without   
     consequence or responsibility 
  are you accepting my offer 
my answer is still no 
you fight much harder than you fuck 
 themistokles screams 
surrender to me or meet your death 
who would you fight   
   if not for me 
no one could challenge your skill 
i would rather die a free man than as a slave 
even if the chain was attached to you 
gorgo  it begins as a whisper 
a promise 
the lightest of breezes   
   dances through the rigging   
   as it creaks above the death cries
of 10 000 men 
it moves through her hair
as gently as a lover s hand 
that breeze   
   that promise  became a wind 
a wind that is blown across greece   
   carrying a message told again and again   
   of our lady freedom
and how wise she was   
   to charge leonidas to lay all at her feet 
a wind  my brothers  of sacrifice 
a wind of freedom 
a wind of justice 
a wind of vengeance 
men   in unison 
ah ooh  ah ooh  ah ooh 
 men continue chanting 
 artemisia grunts 
you are being surrounded 
all of greece has united against you 
delphi  thebes  olympia   
   arcadia and sparta 
if death comes for me today  i m ready 
i could lower my sword 
there s still time for you
to ready a launch and escape 
it would be a poor choice
to force my hand into action 
now order your ships to disengage
and surrender to me 
surrender 
 groans
