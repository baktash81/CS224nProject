they find in each new toy
i ll tell you of a little boy
who lives across the way
this little fella s christmas
ls just another day
lt was just before dawn
one miserable morning
ln black  44
when the forward commander
was told to sit tight
when he asked that
his men be withdrawn
and the generals gave thanks
as the other ranks
held back the enemy tanks
for a while
and the anzio bridgehead
was held for the price
of a few hundred ordinary lives
he s the little boy
that santa claus forgot
and goodness knows
he didn  t want a lot
he sent a note to santa
for some soldiers and a drum
lt broke his little heart
when he found santa hadn t come
ln the street he envies
all those lucky boys
so ya thought ya
might like to
go to the show
to feel the warm thrill
of confusion
that space cadet glow
tell me  is something
eluding you  sunshine
ls this not what
you expected to see
lf you wanna find out
what s behind these cold eyes
you ll just have to
claw your way through this disguise
mama loves her baby
and daddy loves you too
and the sea may look
warm to you  babe
and the sky may look blue
ooh  ooh  ooh
ooh  babe
ooh  ooh  ooh
baby blue
ooh  ooh  ooh
ooh  ooh  babe
lf you should go skating
on the thin ice of modern life
dragging behind you
the silent reproach
of a million tear stained eyes
don  t be surprised
when a crack in the ice
appears under your feet
you slip out of your depth
and out of your mind
with you fear
flowing out behind you
as you claw the thin ice
daddy s flown across the ocean
leaving just a memory
a snapshot in the family album
daddy  what else
did you leave for me
daddy  what d ya leave behind for me
all in all it was
just a brick in the wall
all in all it was all
just bricks in the wall
easy  be careful 
  what 
  will you put me on there 
  well  where s your mother  then 
  she s gone to the shops 
yes  all right 
how s that then  enjoying it 
lovely  lovely 
now off you go 
go on 
now what have l told you about this 
what have l told you 
go on  go on now  sling your hook 
go on  sling your hook 
and kind old king george
sent mother a note
when he heard that father was gone
lt was  l recall
ln the form of a scroll
gold leaf and all
and l found it one day
ln a drawer of old photographs
hidden away
and my eyes still grow damp
to remember
his majesty signed
with his own rubber stamp
lt was dark all around
there was frost in the ground
when the tigers broke free
and no one survived
from the royal fusiliers company c
they were all left behind
most of them dead
the rest of them dying
and that s how the high command
took my daddy from me
did you see the frightened ones
did you hear the falling bombs
did you ever wonder why
we had to run for shelter
when the promise of a brave new world
unfurled beneath the clear blue sky
did you see the frightened ones
did you hear the falling bombs
the flames are all long gone
but the pain lingers on
good bye
blue sky
good bye  blue sky
good bye
good bye

an acre is the area
of a rectangle   
whose length is one furlong   
and whose width is one chain 
but in this town it was well known
when they got home at night
their fat and psychopathic wives
would thrash them
within inches of their lives
we don  t need no education
we don t need no thought control
no dark sarcasm in the classroom

hey  teacher  leave them kids alone
all in all it s just
another brick in the wall

one of my bad days

in your favorite disguise
with your button down lips
and your roller blind eyes
with your empty smile
and your hungry heart

from your guilty past
with your nerves in tatters
as the cockleshell shatters
and the hammers batter down your door
you better run
run  run  run
run  run  run  run
run  run  run  run
run  run  run  run
you better run all day
and run all night
keep your dirty feelings deep inside
and if you re taking
your girlfriend out tonight

well out of sight
 cause if they catch you in
the back seat trying to pick her locks
they re gonna send you back to mother
in a cardboard box
you better run
you cannot reach me now
no matter how you try
good bye  cruel world
lt s over
walk on by
waiting
  to cut out the dead wood
  waiting
  to weed out the weaklings
  waiting
to smash in their windows
and kick in their doors
  waiting
  for the final solution
to strengthen the strain
  waiting
  to follow the worms
  would you like to see
  would you like to see
britannia rule again
my friend
all you need to do
is follow the worms

because l have to know

have l been guilty all this time
good morning  worm  your honor
the crown will plainly show
the prisoner who now stands before you
was caught red handed showing feelings
showing feelings
of an almost human nature
this will not do
call the schoolmaster
l always said he d come to no good
ln the end  your honor
lf they d let me have my way
l could have flayed him into shape
but my hands were tied
the bleeding hearts and artists
let him get away with murder
let me hammer him today

they must have taken my marbles away
crazy
toys in the attic

the evidence before the court
is incontrovertible
there  s no need
for the jury to retire
ln all my years of judging
l have never heard before
of someone more deserving
the full penalty of law
the way you made them suffer
your exquisite wife and mother
fills me with the urge to defecate
since  my friend
you have revealed your deepest fear
l sentence you to be exposed
before your peers
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
tear down the wall
all alone
or in two s
the ones who really love you
walk up and down
outside the wall
some hand in hand
some gathered together in bands
the bleeding hearts
and the artists
make their stand
and when they ve given you their all
some stagger and fall
after all  it s not easy
