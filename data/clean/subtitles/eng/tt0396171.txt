  come on 
  get up 
quick 
faster 
open the doors  come on  quickly 
just read them the sentence 
the sentence of the court
is that in two days hence
the perfumer journeyman
jean baptiste grenouille
shall be bound to a wooden cross
with his face raised toward heaven 
and whilst still alive
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod
breaking the joints of his arms 
his shoulders 
his hips 
his legs 
he shall then be raised up
to hang until dead
and all customary acts of mercy
are expressly forbidden
the executioner 
in 18th century france 
there lived a man who was
one of the most gifted
and notorious personages
of his time 
his name was
jean baptiste grenouille 
and if his name has been
forgotten today  it is
for the reason that his ambition
was restricted to a domain
that leaves no trace in history 
to the fleeting realm of scent 
in the period of which we speak 
there reigned
in the cities a stench
barely conceivable to us
modern men and women 
naturally  the stench
was foulest in paris 
for paris was
the largest city in europe 
and nowhere in paris was that
stench more profoundly repugnant
than in the city s fish market 
here we are 
i ll get another box 
it was here  then  on the most
putrid spot in the whole kingdom 
that jean baptiste grenouille
was born
on the 17th of july  1738 
it was his mother s fifth birth 
she d delivered them all here
under her fishstand
and all had been stillbirths 
or semi stillbirths 
you all right 
and the whole mess was shoveled
with the fishguts into the river 
it would be much the same today
but then 
jean baptiste chose differently
what s that noise 
  it s a baby 
  what s going on here 
it s a newborn 
where s its mother 
she was just here 
she tried to kill it 
her own child 
she tried to kill her baby 
there  there she is 
stop  stop where you are 
murderer 
thus  the first sound
to escape grenouille s lips
sent his mother to the gallows
and jean  baptiste 
by official order 
to the orphanage
of madame gaillard 
how many today 
four  well  three and a half 
as usual  more dead than alive 
just take the money and sign 
make room 
  where 
  move 
go on  now 
is it dead 
that s not staying in my bed 
  let s throw it out  then 
  what if it screams 
let s just kill it 
harder  push 
what are you doing 
for mme gaillard  grenouille was a
source of income  like any other 
the children  however 
sensed at once
that there was something
different about him 
by the age of five  jean baptiste
still could not talk 
but he was born with a talent that
made him unique among mankind 
it was not that the other
children hated him 
they felt unnerved by him 
increasingly he became aware that
his phenomenal sense of smell
was a gift that had been
given to him  and him alone 
when jean baptiste
did finally learn to speak
he soon found that everyday
language proved inadequate
for all the olfactory experiences
accumulating within himself
wood 
warm wood 
grass 
wet grass 
stones 
warm stones 
water 
cold water 
frog 
wet stones 
big  wet frog stones 
something 
something 
something 
by 13  mme gaillard no longer
had room for jean baptiste
and therefore
decided to sell him 
come on 
ten francs 
from his first breath of the odor
enveloping this man   
seven  and not one sou more 
grenouille knew that
his life in grimal s tannery
would be worth precisely as much
as the work he could accomplish 
unfortunately for madame gaillard 
the bargain was short lived 
life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years
but jean baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium 
he adjusted to his new fate
and became a paragon
of docility and diligence 
slaved 15  16 hours a day 
summer and winter 
gradually he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery 
where a utopia of unexplored
smells lay in store for him 
grenouille 
come with us  i m taking you
to town for delivery 
jean baptiste grenouille
had triumphed 
he was alive
and at last he was
in his element 
he was not choosy 
he did not differentiate between
what are good smells from bad
at least not yet 
he was very greedy 
the goal was to possess everything
the world had to offer in odors 
his only condition being 
that they were new ones 
thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel
which he dissected into its
most remote parts and pieces 
grenouille 
come on 
get your ass over here 
he needs two dozen skins
by next week  can you do that 
  yeah  yeah 
  yeah  come with me 
what is it called 
 amor and psyche   madame 
my latest creation 
may i try it 
if you ll allow me  mademoiselle 
sheer heaven 
monsieur pelissier 
you are truly an artiste 
please  take them 
i ve got far too many 
what do you want 
want to buy some 
two for a sou 
next time you run off like that 
i ll kill you 
that night  he could not sleep 
the intoxicating power of the
girl  5 scent made it clear to him
why he d come to his own life
so tenaciously  so savagely 
the purpose of his miserable
existence had a higher destiny 
he would learn
how to preserve scent
so that never again would he
lose such sublime beauty 
there were about a dozen
perfumers in paris in those days 
one of them  the once celebrated
italian perfumer  giuseppe baldini 
had set up shop in the center of
the bridge called pont au change
on his arrival in paris
over thirty years ago 
to be sure  at one time in
his youth  baldini had created
several truly great perfumes 
to which he owed his fortune 
but now baldini was
out of touch  out of fashion 
and spent his days waiting for
customers that no longer came 
  chenier  there you are 
  monsieur baldini 
put on your wig 
put on your wig 
you going out 
i wish to retire to my study
for a few hours
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances 
will you be creating a new
perfume  monsieur baldini 
correct  for count verhamont 
he has asked for something like   
i think he said it was called
amor and psyche from that swindler
in the rue saint andré des arts 
pelissier 
pelissier  that s him 
amor and psyche 
do you know it 
oh  yes  you can smell it
everywhere these days  monsieur 
on every street corner 
in fact  i just
purchased you a sample 
in case you wanted to test it 
what on earth makes you think i d
be interested in testing it 
you re right 
it s nothing special 
actually
it s a very common scent 
i believe the head chord
contains lime oil 
really  and the heart chord 
orange blossom  i believe 
and civet in the base chord 
but  you know 
i cannot say for sure 
well  i couldn t care less
what that bungler pelissier
  slops into his perfumes 
  naturally not  monsieur 
and i am thinking of creating
something for count verhamont
that will cause
a veritable sensation 
i m sure it will 
monsieur baldini 
take charge of the shop  chenier 
and don t let anyone come near me 
inspiration requires
peace and tranquility 
is there anything else you need 
inspiration  perhaps 
ah  my giuseppe 
you are still
the great perfumer baldini 
wonderful 
he did it again 
lime oil 
orange blossom 
to be sure 
and a hint of cloves  perhaps 
no 
or could be cinnamon 
it s gone 
cinnamon 
it s not cinnamon 
cloves 
no 
musk 
no 
who s there 
i m from grimal s tannery 
i ve got the goatskins
you ordered 
follow me 
this way 
there 
lay them there 
tell your master
that the skins are fine 
i ll come by in the next
few days and pay for them 
yes  monsieur 
you want to make this leather
smell good  don t you 
why  of course and so it shall 
with amor   psyche by pelissier 
whatever gave you the absurd idea
i would use someone else s perfume 
it s all over you 
it s on your forehead 
your nose  your hands   
it s bad  amor   psyche
is  master 
there s too much rosemary in it 
and too much of   
that and that 
bergamot and patchouli 
pat    
patchouli 
patchouli 
what else 
that and that 
that and that 
orange blossom 
lime   
  rosemary 
  musk 
and cloves 
and this 
  storax 
  that s in it too 
  storax 
  storax 
you have  it appears 
a fine nose  young man 
my nose knows all the smells
in the world 
it s the best nose in paris 
only i don t know the names 
i need to learn the names 
learn them all   
no  no  no 
you don t interrupt me
when i m speaking 
you are both impertinent
and insolent 
even i don t know every scent 
i ve  of course  known for some time
the ingredients of amor   psyche 
but all it needs to find that out is
a passably fine nose  nothing else 
but it needs the craft
of a true perfumer
to detect the exact formula 
which notes  which chords 
and in what precise measurements 
could you tell me the exact
formula of amor   psyche 
best nose in paris 
speak up 
you see  you can t  can you 
and i ll tell you why 
because talent means
next to nothing 
while experience acquired
in humility and hard work
means everything 
i don t know what a formula is 
but i can make amor   psyche
for you now 
and you think i just let you
slop around in my laboratory
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune 
you 
yes 
now pay attention 
what is your name  anyway 
jean baptiste grenouille 
very well 
jean baptiste grenouille 
you shall have the opportunity now
to prove your assertion 
your grandiose failure will also
be an opportunity for you
to learn the virtue of humility 
  how much do you want me to make 
  how much of what    
how much amor   psyche do you want 
shall i fill this flask 
no  you shall not 
you may fill this one 
yes  master 
but  master baldini   
you must let me do it in my own way 
as you please 
no 
don t drop it  that s pure alcohol 
you want to blow up the building 
you have to measure it first 
stop  stop it 
that s enough 
you know nothing 
essential oils are always
to be mixed first 
then the alcohol added
and never ever is perfume
to be shaken like that 
i must have been insane to listen
to your asinine gibberish 
it s all done 
this is amor   psyche 
but it s not
a good perfume  master 
if you let me again  master 
i ll make it more better 
now it s a really good perfume 
don t you want
to smell it  master 
i m not in the mood
to test it now 
i have other things
on my mind  go now 
  but  master   
  go  now 
can i come to work
for you  master  can i 
let me think about it 
master 
i have to learn
how to keep smell 
what 
can you teach me that 
i shall have to think
about it  now  go 
i love you 
i ll give you 50 francs for him 
grenouille 
grimal s transaction
had a profound effect
on all three parties 
not least upon
monsieur grimal himself
as for giuseppe baldini 
the acquisition of grenouille
miraculously transformed
his dwindling business
even surpassing its former glory 
while at last  for jean baptiste 
the mysterious secrets
of the perfumers craft
began to unfold 
now  pay careful attention
to what i tell you 
just like a musical chord 
a perfume chord contains
four essences
or notes  carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity 
each perfume contains three chords 
the head  the heart and the base 
necessitating twelve notes in all 
the head chord contains
the first impression 
lasting a few minutes
before giving way
to the heart chord 
the theme of the perfume 
lasting several hours 
finally  the base chord 
the trail of the perfume 
lasting several days 
mind you  the ancient egyptians
believed that one can only create
a truly original perfume
by adding an extra note 
one final essence
that will ring out
and dominate the others 
legend has it that an amphora
was once found in a pharaoh s tomb
and when it was opened
a perfume was released 
after all those thousands of years 
a perfume of such subtle
beauty and yet such power 
that for one single moment
every person on earth believed
they were in paradise 
twelve essences could be identified 
but the 13th 
the vital one 
could never be determined 
why not 
why not 
what do you mean  why not 
because it s a legend  numbskull 
what s a legend 
never mind 
jean baptiste 
jean baptiste 
what s the matter 
master 
i have to learn
how to capture scent 
what are you talking about 
i have to learn
how to capture scent
and reprise it forever 
you mean  preserve 
you have to teach me that 
all right 
calm down  my boy 
calm down 
we have work to do 
 the soul of beings is their scent  
you said that  master 
did i 
i will make you
as many perfumes as you want
but you have to teach me
how to capture
the smell of all things 
can you do that 
well  naturally 
then teach me
everything you know
and i ll make you the best
perfume in the whole world 
imagine  jean baptiste 
ten thousand roses to produce
one single ounce of essential oil 
now  keep the air flowing or the
bottom petals will begin to stew
while i set up the alembic 
and take care not to damage them 
we have to let them go to their
deaths with their scent intact 
perfect 
now  help me
with the moor s head 
temperature is vital 
when the quicksilver is here 
the heat is precisely correct
and the oil will gradually rise 
note this mechanism is a remarkable
invention of my own devising 
you will observe how cold water
is pumped through here
allowing the essence
to condense here
until it finally appears
here 
of course 
out on the hillside above grasse
we had only to bellow
pure  fresh air 
ah  grasse  what a town 
the rome of scents 
the promised land of perfume 
no man can rightly
call himself a perfumer
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place 
not to worry 
happens all the time 
to grasse 
master 
look 
the very soul of the rose 
jean baptiste 
what s wrong 
jean baptiste 
what have you done 
  you lied 
  what 
you lied to me 
how dare you talk to me like that 
you said i could capture
the scent of anything 
and so you can 
what do you smell 
what do you smell 
nothing 
what were you expecting to smell 
glass 
but glass doesn t smell 
course it does 
what s this 
i don t smell a thing 
it should smell like copper 
enough 
you were trying to distill
the smell of copper 
iron  glass  copper 
what else did you try 
no 
have you gone completely insane 
you told me i had to experiment 
experiment  experiment 
but not with the cat 
what kind of a human being are you 
don t you know anything 
you can no more distill
the scent of a cat
than you can distill
the scent of you or me 
i can t 
of course not 
he is in stadio ultimo 
  what 
  he s dying 
is there nothing you can do 
  i fear not 
  no  he cannot die 
well  my fee is 50 francs 
50 francs 
you charlatan 
you can t even name the disease 
no  jean baptiste 
you cannot do this to me 
not now  not yet 
is there
any other way
to preserve smell
besides distill it 
jean baptiste 
is there  master 
well  yes  i believe there is 
what is it 
it is known as the mysterious
art of enfleurage 
can you teach me 
not even i am intimate
with its secrets 
but could i learn it in grasse 
  well   
  could i 
where else but in grasse 
within a week grenouille
was well again 
but to travel to grasse to find
a job he needed journey papers 
baldini agreed to provide them
on condition that
grenouille left him
not less than one hundred
formulas for new perfumes 
grenouille did not mind  he
could have given him a thousand
the morning of grenouille s 
departure  baldini was pleased 
at last  he felt rewarded for
his many years of hard work 
he could not remember
a happier day 
deeply satisfied 
he went back to sleep
and awoke no more in this life 
with every step he took from
the city  the happier he felt 
the air above him grew
clearer  purer  cleaner 
and at last he was able
to breathe freely 
there were two ways
to reach grasse 
the first followed the winding
roads through the villages
while the second lead across
the mountains  down into provence 
the choice was quite easy 
thus his nose led him
ever higher 
ever further from mankind 
more towards the magnetic pole of
the greatest possible solitude 
grenouille needed a moment to
believe that he had actually found
a spot on earth where scent
was almost absent 
spread all around lay nothing but
the tranquil scent of dead stone 
there was something sacred
about this place 
no longer distracted
by anything external 
he was finally able to bask
in his own existence
and found it splendid 
after a while  he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions
ana  indeed  might have done
so altogether 
hello 
hello 
hello 
there were a thousand
smells in his clothes 
the smell of sand  stone  moss 
even the smell of the sausage
he d eaten weeks ago 
only one smell was not there 
his own 
for the first time  grenouille
realized he had no smell 
he realized that all his life
he had been a nobody to everyone 
what he now felt was the fear
of his own oblivion 
it was as though
he did not exist 
by the first light of next morning 
grenouille had a new plan 
he must continue
his journey to grasse 
there he would teach the world
not only that he existed 
that he was someone 
but that he was exceptional 
and with this decision
it seemed that the gods had
at last begun to smile on him 
go in 
laura 
laura 
coming  papa 
haven t seen you here before 
it s my first season

they say you pick
everything you find 
idiot 
how many times have i told you
not to cram the blossoms in
like you re stuffing a chicken 
watch how grenouille does it 
look how skillfully
he handles them 
the whole art of enfleurage is
to allow the flowers to die slowly 
in their sleep  as it were 
handle them as you would a lady 
wouldn t you agree with me  druot 
if you say so  madame 
you  check the jonquil blossoms 
they need more time

or whatever you do with them 
so what do you do with them 
warm them in animal fat

your master s account

what s that stuff 
i m creating a perfume 
lie down  please

some sort of bang out of this 
aren t you 
i enjoy my work 
hold your arm still 
don t think
you re gonna tie me up 
hold out your arm  please 
i ve come across some
strange men in my time

holy mother  what s that  
just for scraping off the fat 
  are you mad

if you re frightened  you stink 
then your perfume will be spoiled 
i ve had enough

to our guest of honour 
his excellency 
the marquis de montesquieu 
may our trade

i thank you all
and would ask of you
the honour to be the first
to offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter
and present her with a small
token of my affection 
it s beautiful 
i m overwhelmed  your grace 
 your grace  
i had hoped that we would be
on more familiar terms by now 
let s have a game
of hide and seek 
oh yes  but everyone must play 
let the men catch the women 
albine  wait

i ll kill him  the useless
little sewer rat 
grenouille 
what are you doing 
why aren t the enfleurage
frames   
yes  master 
i mean  would you be good enough
to prepare the enfleurage frames 
certainly  master 
a curfew 
are you mad 
jasmine can only be picked
before dawn  we all know that 
this could mean
the ruin of our trade 
yours 
and yours and yours 
supposing it s your daughter
next time 
of course a curfew is necessary 
but we also have to catch this man
and to do that is to understand
how he thinks  what he wants 
i should have thought that
was obvious  use your imagination 
and if i were to tell you
that all except the prostitute
went to their graves
with their chastity intact 
how would you know 
the coroner had each girl examined 
they were all found to be virgins 
supposing there isn t a next time 
if we introduce a curfew we
may all go bankrupt for nothing 
so we wait until he s killed 
what  six 
seven  eight 
curfew 
go back to your homes 
gentlemen 
gentlemen 
we have to face the fact that our
police are helpless in this matter 
i suggest that we ask
for support from paris 
paris won t be smarter than we are 
we must arrest every gypsy
in provence  and every beggar 
and every man without
a wife and family 
listen 
we have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man 
each of his victims
had an especial beauty 
we know he doesn t want
their virginity  so it seems to me
that it s their beauty itself
that he wants 
it s almost as if he s trying
to gather something 
as if his ambitions
are those of a collector 
a collector  of what 
their hair 
whatever it is 
i fear he won t stop killing
until his collection is complete 
monsieur 
this man is a demon 
a phantom who cannot be fought
by human means 
now  i insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him 
what good would that do 
have you no faith in the power
of our holy mother church 
this is not a matter of faith 
there s a murderer out there
and we must catch him
by using our god given wits 
i say until
we submit to mother church
these killings will not cease 
citizens of grasse  we hereby
declare that this murderer 
this demon in our midst 
has incurred the sentence
of excommunication 
not only has this depraved monster
robbed us of our daughters 
the young and fair blossom
of this city 
and by his wanton acts
has brought our trade 
our livelihood 
our very existence 
to the brink of eternal darkness 
we therefore declare
that this vile viper 
this ignominious carbuncle 
this execrable evil in our midst 
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our holy presence 
rejected from the communion
of holy mother church
as a disciple of satan 
slayer of souls 
stand clear 
an infected limb 
an outsider of the faith
a necromancer 
a diabolist  a sorcerer
and a damned heretic 
oh  god  in thy most
merciful spirit 
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head
and may the devil
make soup of his bones 
amen 
my lord  it s a miracle 
he s been caught 
he s been caught 
my lord  the fiend has been caught 
in the city of grenoble 
he s confessed to everything 
he s confessed to everything 
hallelujah 
hallelujah 
praise be to god 
and we thank him
for listening to our prayers
and answering them 
amen 
amen 
just read the report 
this cannot possibly
be the same man 
he confessed to everything 
including the murders in grasse 
yes  under torture 
look  here 
he admits to strangling
his victims 
pulling out their hair
and ravaging them 
the grasse girls were killed by
a blow to the back of their heads
their hair was carefully cropped 
and not one of them was violated 
antoine

it will be our pleasure  monsieur 
and tomorrow  at first light  we wish
to be ferried to the ile de lérin 
  it s deserted  just a few monks 
  i m aware of that 
very well  monsieur 
our finest room  mademoiselle 
with a superb view of the sea 
one moment 
very well 
do you have a room next to this one 
  yes  but the view is different 
  i have no interest in the view 
papa  will you please tell me
now what is happening 
you haven t said a word all day 
why all this secrecy 
last night i dreamt you were dead 
murdered like all the other girls 
the truth is  i m convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere 
all of his victims
were young and beautiful 
and who is there more beautiful
than you  laura 
whatever his insane scheme 
it will surely be incomplete
without you 
i wrote to the marquis accepting
his proposal of marriage
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible 
until then you will stay
in the safety of the monastery 
and all this because
you had a bad dream 
  i ve made my decision 
  but i don t know if i love him 
i m afraid the circumstances
leave us no choice 
  papa 
  it s all arranged  laura 
on your feet 
hands in the air 
why did you kill my daughter 
why 
i needed her 
why did you kill my daughter 
i just   
needed her 
very well 
but remember this 
i will be looking at you
when you are laid on the cross
and the twelve blows
are crashing down on your limbs 
and when the crowd has finally tired
of your screams and wandered home 
i will climb up through your blood
and sit beside you 
i will look deep into your eyes
and drop by drop
i will trickle my disgust into them
like burning acid 
until
finally
you perish 
unchain the prisoner 
that s enough 
let him be brought to the scaffold 
what s that 
he s over there 
this man is innocent 
he is innocent 
a  angel 
this is no man 
this is an angel 
grenouille 
you can t fool me 
forgive me 
my son 
the people of grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover 
for many of them 
the experience was so ghastly 
so completely inexplicable and
incompatible with their morals
that they literally erased it
from their memories 
the town council was
in session by the afternoon
and an order was passed
to the police lieutenant
to immediately begin fresh
investigations into the murders 
the following day 
dominique druot was arrested 
it was in his back yard that they
found the hair of the victims 
after fourteen hours of torture 
druot confessed to everything 
with that  the case was closed 
by then  grenouille was already
half way back to paris 
he had enough perfume left to
enslave the world if he so chose 
he could walk to versailles
and have the king kiss his feet 
he could write the pope a letter 
re veal himself as the new messiah 
he could do all this
and more if he wanted to 
he possessed a power stronger
than the power of money 
or terror  or death 
the invincible power to command
the love of mankind 
there was only one thing
the perfume could not do 
it could not turn him
into a person
who could love and be loved
like everyone else 
50  to hell with it  he thought 
to hell with the world 
with the perfume 
with himself
on the 25th of june  1766 
around 110  clock at night 
grenouille entered the city
through the port d orleans
and like a sleep walker 
his olfactory memories drew him
back to where he was born 
a  angel 
i love you 
within no time 
jean baptiste grenouille
had disappeared from
the face of the earth 
when they had finished  they
felt a virginal glow of happiness 
for the first time
in their lives
they believed that they
had done something
