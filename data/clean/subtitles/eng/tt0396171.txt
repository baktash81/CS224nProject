come on
get up
quick
faster
open the doors come on quickly
just read them the sentence
the sentence of the court
is that in two days hence
the perfumer journeyman
jeanbaptiste grenouille
shall be bound to a wooden cross
with his face raised toward heaven
and whilst still alive
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod
breaking the joints of his arms
his shoulders
his hips
his legs
he shall then be raised up
to hang until dead
and all customary acts of mercy
are expressly forbidden
the executioner
in 18thcentury france
there lived a man who was
one of the most gifted
and notorious personages
of his time
his name was
jeanbaptiste grenouille
and if his name has been
forgotten today it is
for the reason that his ambition
was restricted to a domain
that leaves no trace in history
to the fleeting realm of scent
in the period of which we speak
there reigned
in the cities a stench
barely conceivable to us
modern men and women
naturally the stench
was foulest in paris
for paris was
the largest city in europe
and nowhere in paris was that
stench more profoundly repugnant
than in the citys fish market
here we are
ill get another box
it was here then on the most
putrid spot in the whole kingdom
that jeanbaptiste grenouille
was born
on the 17th of july 1738
it was his mothers fifth birth
shed delivered them all here
under her fishstand
and all had been stillbirths
or semistillbirths
you all right
and the whole mess was shoveled
with the fishguts into the river
it would be much the same today
but then
jeanbaptiste chose differently
whats that noise
its a baby
whats going on here
its a newborn
wheres its mother
she was just here
she tried to kill it
her own child
she tried to kill her baby
there there she is
stop stop where you are
murderer
thus the first sound
to escape grenouilles lips
sent his mother to the gallows
and jean baptiste
by official order
to the orphanage
of madame gaillard
how many today
four well three and a half
as usual more dead than alive
just take the money and sign
make room
where
move
go on now
is it dead
thats not staying in my bed
lets throw it out then
what if it screams
lets just kill it
harder push
what are you doing
for mme gaillard grenouille was a
source of income like any other
the children however
sensed at once
that there was something
different about him
by the age of five jeanbaptiste
still could not talk
but he was born with a talent that
made him unique among mankind
it was not that the other
children hated him
they felt unnerved by him
increasingly he became aware that
his phenomenal sense of smell
was a gift that had been
given to him and him alone
when jeanbaptiste
did finally learn to speak
he soon found that everyday
language proved inadequate
for all the olfactory experiences
accumulating within himself
wood
warm wood
grass
wet grass
stones
warm stones
water
cold water
frog
wet stones
big wet frog stones
something
something
something
by 13 mme gaillard no longer
had room for jeanbaptiste
and therefore
decided to sell him
come on
ten francs
from his first breath of the odor
enveloping this man
seven and not one sou more
grenouille knew that
his life in grimals tannery
would be worth precisely as much
as the work he could accomplish
unfortunately for madame gaillard
the bargain was shortlived
life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years
but jeanbaptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium
he adjusted to his new fate
and became a paragon
of docility and diligence
slaved 15 16 hours a day
summer and winter
gradually he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery
where a utopia of unexplored
smells lay in store for him
grenouille
come with us im taking you
to town for delivery
jeanbaptiste grenouille
had triumphed
he was alive
and at last he was
in his element
he was not choosy
he did not differentiate between
what are good smells from bad
at least not yet
he was very greedy
the goal was to possess everything
the world had to offer in odors
his only condition being
that they were new ones
thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel
which he dissected into its
most remote parts and pieces
grenouille
come on
get your ass over here
he needs two dozen skins
by next week can you do that
yeah yeah
yeah come with me
what is it called
amor and psyche madame
my latest creation
may i try it
if youll allow me mademoiselle
sheer heaven
monsieur pelissier
you are truly an artiste
please take them
ive got far too many
what do you want
want to buy some
two for a sou
next time you run off like that
ill kill you
that night he could not sleep
the intoxicating power of the
girl 5 scent made it clear to him
why hed come to his own life
so tenaciously so savagely
the purpose of his miserable
existence had a higher destiny
he would learn
how to preserve scent
so that never again would he
lose such sublime beauty
there were about a dozen
perfumers in paris in those days
one of them the oncecelebrated
italian perfumer giuseppe baldini
had set up shop in the center of
the bridge called pont au change
on his arrival in paris
over thirty years ago
to be sure at one time in
his youth baldini had created
several truly great perfumes
to which he owed his fortune
but now baldini was
out of touch out of fashion
and spent his days waiting for
customers that no longer came
chenier there you are
monsieur baldini
put on your wig
put on your wig
you going out
i wish to retire to my study
for a few hours
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances
will you be creating a new
perfume monsieur baldini
correct for count verhamont
he has asked for something like
i think he said it was called
amor and psyche from that swindler
in the rue saint andr√© des arts
pelissier
pelissier thats him
amor and psyche
do you know it
oh yes you can smell it
everywhere these days monsieur
on every street corner
in fact i just
purchased you a sample
in case you wanted to test it
what on earth makes you think id
be interested in testing it
youre right
its nothing special
actually
its a very common scent
i believe the head chord
contains lime oil
really and the heart chord
orange blossom i believe
and civet in the base chord
but you know
i cannot say for sure
well i couldnt care less
what that bungler pelissier
slops into his perfumes
naturally not monsieur
and i am thinking of creating
something for count verhamont
that will cause
a veritable sensation
im sure it will
monsieur baldini
take charge of the shop chenier
and dont let anyone come near me
inspiration requires
peace and tranquility
is there anything else you need
inspiration perhaps
ah my giuseppe
you are still
the great perfumer baldini
wonderful
he did it again
lime oil
orange blossom
to be sure
and a hint of cloves perhaps
no
or could be cinnamon
its gone
cinnamon
its not cinnamon
cloves
no
musk
no
whos there
im from grimals tannery
ive got the goatskins
you ordered
follow me
this way
there
lay them there
tell your master
that the skins are fine
ill come by in the next
few days and pay for them
yes monsieur
you want to make this leather
smell good dont you
why of course and so it shall
with amor  psyche by pelissier
whatever gave you the absurd idea
i would use someone elses perfume
its all over you
its on your forehead
your nose your hands
its bad amor  psyche
is master
theres too much rosemary in it
and too much of
that and that
bergamot and patchouli
pat
patchouli
patchouli
what else
that and that
that and that
orange blossom
lime
rosemary
musk
and cloves
and this
storax
thats in it too
storax
storax
you have it appears
a fine nose young man
my nose knows all the smells
in the world
its the best nose in paris
only i dont know the names
i need to learn the names
learn them all
no no no
you dont interrupt me
when im speaking
you are both impertinent
and insolent
even i dont know every scent
ive of course known for some time
the ingredients of amor  psyche
but all it needs to find that out is
a passably fine nose nothing else
but it needs the craft
of a true perfumer
to detect the exact formula
which notes which chords
and in what precise measurements
could you tell me the exact
formula of amor  psyche
bestnoseinparis
speak up
you see you cant can you
and ill tell you why
because talent means
next to nothing
while experience acquired
in humility and hard work
means everything
i dont know what a formula is
but i can make amor  psyche
for you now
and you think i just let you
slop around in my laboratory
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune
you
yes
now pay attention
what is your name anyway
jeanbaptiste grenouille
very well
jeanbaptiste grenouille
you shall have the opportunity now
to prove your assertion
your grandiose failure will also
be an opportunity for you
to learn the virtue of humility
how much do you want me to make
how much of what
how much amor  psyche do you want
shall i fill this flask
no you shall not
you may fill this one
yes master
but master baldini
you must let me do it in my own way
as you please
no
dont drop it thats pure alcohol
you want to blow up the building
you have to measure it first
stop stop it
thats enough
you know nothing
essential oils are always
to be mixed first
then the alcohol added
and never ever is perfume
to be shaken like that
i must have been insane to listen
to your asinine gibberish
its all done
this is amor  psyche
but its not
a good perfume master
if you let me again master
ill make it more better
now its a really good perfume
dont you want
to smell it master
im not in the mood
to test it now
i have other things
on my mind go now
but master
go now
can i come to work
for you master can i
let me think about it
master
i have to learn
how to keep smell
what
can you teach me that
i shall have to think
about it now go
i love you
ill give you 50 francs for him
grenouille
grimals transaction
had a profound effect
on all three parties
not least upon
monsieur grimal himself
as for giuseppe baldini
the acquisition of grenouille
miraculously transformed
his dwindling business
even surpassing its former glory
while at last for jeanbaptiste
the mysterious secrets
of the perfumers craft
began to unfold
now pay careful attention
to what i tell you
just like a musical chord
a perfume chord contains
four essences
or notes carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity
each perfume contains three chords
the head the heart and the base
necessitating twelve notes in all
the head chord contains
the first impression
lasting a few minutes
before giving way
to the heart chord
the theme of the perfume
lasting several hours
finally the base chord
the trail of the perfume
lasting several days
mind you the ancient egyptians
believed that one can only create
a truly original perfume
by adding an extra note
one final essence
that will ring out
and dominate the others
legend has it that an amphora
was once found in a pharaohs tomb
and when it was opened
a perfume was released
after all those thousands of years
a perfume of such subtle
beauty and yet such power
that for one single moment
every person on earth believed
they were in paradise
twelve essences could be identified
but the 13th
the vital one
could never be determined
why not
why not
what do you mean why not
because its a legend numbskull
whats a legend
never mind
jeanbaptiste
jeanbaptiste
whats the matter
master
i have to learn
how to capture scent
what are you talking about
i have to learn
how to capture scent
and reprise it forever
you mean preserve
you have to teach me that
all right
calm down my boy
calm down
we have work to do
the soul of beings is their scent
you said that master
did i
i will make you
as many perfumes as you want
but you have to teach me
how to capture
the smell of all things
can you do that
well naturally
then teach me
everything you know
and ill make you the best
perfume in the whole world
imagine jeanbaptiste
ten thousand roses to produce
one single ounce of essential oil
now keep the air flowing or the
bottom petals will begin to stew
while i set up the alembic
and take care not to damage them
we have to let them go to their
deaths with their scent intact
perfect
now help me
with the moors head
temperature is vital
when the quicksilver is here
the heat is precisely correct
and the oil will gradually rise
note this mechanism is a remarkable
invention of my own devising
you will observe how cold water
is pumped through here
allowing the essence
to condense here
until it finally appears
here
of course
out on the hillside above grasse
we had only to bellow
pure fresh air
ah grasse what a town
the rome of scents
the promised land of perfume
no man can rightly
call himself a perfumer
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place
not to worry
happens all the time
to grasse
master
look
the very soul of the rose
jeanbaptiste
whats wrong
jeanbaptiste
what have you done
you lied
what
you lied to me
how dare you talk to me like that
you said i could capture
the scent of anything
and so you can
what do you smell
what do you smell
nothing
what were you expecting to smell
glass
but glass doesnt smell
course it does
whats this
i dont smell a thing
it should smell like copper
enough
you were trying to distill
the smell of copper
iron glass copper
what else did you try
no
have you gone completely insane
you told me i had to experiment
experiment experiment
but not with the cat
what kind of a human being are you
dont you know anything
you can no more distill
the scent of a cat
than you can distill
the scent of you or me
i cant
of course not
he is in stadio ultimo
what
hes dying
is there nothing you can do
i fear not
no he cannot die
well my fee is 50 francs
50 francs
you charlatan
you cant even name the disease
no jeanbaptiste
you cannot do this to me
not now not yet
is there
any other way
to preserve smell
besides distill it
jeanbaptiste
is there master
well yes i believe there is
what is it
it is known as the mysterious
art of enfleurage
can you teach me
not even i am intimate
with its secrets
but could i learn it in grasse
well
could i
where else but in grasse
within a week grenouille
was well again
but to travel to grasse to find
a job he needed journey papers
baldini agreed to provide them
on condition that
grenouille left him
not less than one hundred
formulas for new perfumes
grenouille did not mind he
could have given him a thousand
the morning of grenouille s
departure baldini was pleased
at last he felt rewarded for
his many years of hard work
he could not remember
a happier day
deeply satisfied
he went back to sleep
and awoke no more in this life
with every step he took from
the city the happier he felt
the air above him grew
clearer purer cleaner
and at last he was able
to breathe freely
there were two ways
to reach grasse
the first followed the winding
roads through the villages
while the second lead across
the mountains down into provence
the choice was quite easy
thus his nose led him
ever higher
ever further from mankind
more towards the magnetic pole of
the greatest possible solitude
grenouille needed a moment to
believe that he had actually found
a spot on earth where scent
was almost absent
spread all around lay nothing but
the tranquil scent of dead stone
there was something sacred
about this place
no longer distracted
by anything external
he was finally able to bask
in his own existence
and found it splendid
after a while he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions
ana indeed might have done
so altogether
hello
hello
hello
there were a thousand
smells in his clothes
the smell of sand stone moss
even the smell of the sausage
hed eaten weeks ago
only one smell was not there
his own
for the first time grenouille
realized he had no smell
he realized that all his life
he had been a nobody to everyone
what he now felt was the fear
of his own oblivion
it was as though
he did not exist
by the first light of next morning
grenouille had a new plan
he must continue
his journey to grasse
there he would teach the world
not only that he existed
that he was someone
but that he was exceptional
and with this decision
it seemed that the gods had
at last begun to smile on him
go in
laura
laura
coming papa
havent seen you here before
its my first season
picking together
is always more fun
they say you pick
everything you find
idiot
how many times have i told you
not to cram the blossoms in
like youre stuffing a chicken
watch how grenouille does it
look how skillfully
he handles them
the whole art of enfleurage is
to allow the flowers to die slowly
in their sleep as it were
handle them as you would a lady
wouldnt you agree with me druot
if you say so madame
you check the jonquil blossoms
they need more time
do what i say
stop it
im not in the mood

and then i filter it before

no
not now ive got work to do
you must go now
come on let me look
dont touch
ah my tuberoses

to protect the blossoms
from daylight
to preserve the scent better
well if you say so
come with me ill settle
your masters account
to preserve
their scent better you say
i dont smell much
no then my experiment
was a failure
make sure its your time
youre wasting not ours
how much must i pay
to be with you

whats that stuff
im creating a perfume
lie down please
it feels horrible
its only animal fat
to soak up your scent
creating a perfume eh

some sort of bang out of this
arent you
i enjoy my work
hold your arm still
dont think
youre gonna tie me up
hold out your arm please
ive come across some
strange men in my time

basting me up in all this goo
you think i am a christmas goose
get out of here
quickly blow them out
before the roses melt
roses cant melt papa
these ones can
now id like to propose a toast
to our guest of honour
his excellency
the marquis de montesquieu
may our trade
continue to flourish
i thank you all
and would ask of you
the honour to be the first
to offer my congratulations
to your beautiful daughter
and present her with a small
token of my affection
its beautiful
im overwhelmed your grace
your grace
i had hoped that we would be
on more familiar terms by now
lets have a game
of hideandseek
oh yes but everyone must play
let the men catch the women
albine wait

games over everybody
laura

ill kill him the useless
little sewer rat
grenouille
what are you doing
why arent the enfleurage
frames
yes master
i mean would you be good enough
to prepare the enfleurage frames
certainly master
a curfew
are you mad
jasmine can only be picked
before dawn we all know that
this could mean
the ruin of our trade
yours
and yours and yours
supposing its your daughter
next time
of course a curfew is necessary
but we also have to catch this man
and to do that is to understand
how he thinks what he wants
i should have thought that
was obvious use your imagination
and if i were to tell you
that all except the prostitute
went to their graves
with their chastity intact
how would you know
the coroner had each girl examined
they were all found to be virgins
supposing there isnt a next time
if we introduce a curfew we
may all go bankrupt for nothing
so we wait until hes killed
what six
seven eight
curfew
go back to your homes
gentlemen
gentlemen
we have to face the fact that our
police are helpless in this matter
i suggest that we ask
for support from paris
paris wont be smarter than we are
we must arrest every gypsy
in provence and every beggar
and every man without
a wife and family
listen
we have to put ourselves
inside the mind of this man
each of his victims
had an especial beauty
we know he doesnt want
their virginity so it seems to me
that its their beauty itself
that he wants
its almost as if hes trying
to gather something
as if his ambitions
are those of a collector
a collector of what
their hair
whatever it is
i fear he wont stop killing
until his collection is complete
monsieur
this man is a demon
a phantom who cannot be fought
by human means
now i insist that we call upon
our bishop to excommunicate him
what good would that do
have you no faith in the power
of our holy mother church
this is not a matter of faith
theres a murderer out there
and we must catch him
by using our godgiven wits
i say until
we submit to mother church
these killings will not cease
citizens of grasse we hereby
declare that this murderer
this demon in our midst
has incurred the sentence
of excommunication
not only has this depraved monster
robbed us of our daughters
the young and fair blossom
of this city
and by his wanton acts
has brought our trade
our livelihood
our very existence
to the brink of eternal darkness
we therefore declare
that this vile viper
this ignominious carbuncle
this execrable evil in our midst
shall henceforth be solemnly
banned from our holy presence
rejected from the communion
of holy mother church
as a disciple of satan
slayer of souls
stand clear
an infected limb
an outsider of the faith
a necromancer
a diabolist a sorcerer
and a damned heretic
oh god in thy most
merciful spirit
bring down thunderbolts
upon his head
and may the devil
make soup of his bones
amen
my lord its a miracle
hes been caught
hes been caught
my lord the fiend has been caught
in the city of grenoble
hes confessed to everything
hes confessed to everything
hallelujah
hallelujah
praise be to god
and we thank him
for listening to our prayers
and answering them
amen
amen
just read the report
this cannot possibly
be the same man
he confessed to everything
including the murders in grasse
yes under torture
look here
he admits to strangling
his victims
pulling out their hair
and ravaging them
the grasse girls were killed by
a blow to the back of their heads
their hair was carefully cropped
and not one of them was violated
antoine
were all happy its over
let it go

i know
but you must stop worrying
about me all the time
sweet dreams my love
sweet dreams papa
laura
papa whats the matter

marquis de montesquieu immediately

grenouille
grenouille
grenouille
grenouille
good god
good afternoon monsieur
good afternoon do you have
anyone else staying here
no monsieur
then i would like to take
all your rooms for the night
it will be our pleasure monsieur
and tomorrow at first light we wish
to be ferried to the ile de l√©rin
its deserted just a few monks
im aware of that
very well monsieur
our finest room mademoiselle
with a superb view of the sea
one moment
very well
do you have a room next to this one
yes but the view is different
i have no interest in the view
papa will you please tell me
now what is happening
you havent said a word all day
why all this secrecy
last night i dreamt you were dead
murdered like all the other girls
the truth is im convinced that
the killer is still here somewhere
all of his victims
were young and beautiful
and who is there more beautiful
than you laura
whatever his insane scheme
it will surely be incomplete
without you
i wrote to the marquis accepting
his proposal of marriage
and requesting that it take place
as soon as possible
until then you will stay
in the safety of the monastery
and all this because
you had a bad dream
ive made my decision
but i dont know if i love him
im afraid the circumstances
leave us no choice
papa
its all arranged laura
on your feet
hands in the air
why did you kill my daughter
why
i needed her
why did you kill my daughter
i just
needed her
very well
but remember this
i will be looking at you
when you are laid on the cross
and the twelve blows
are crashing down on your limbs
and when the crowd has finally tired
of your screams and wandered home
i will climb up through your blood
and sit beside you
i will look deep into your eyes
and drop by drop
i will trickle my disgust into them
like burning acid
until
finally
you perish
unchain the prisoner
thats enough
let him be brought to the scaffold
whats that
hes over there
this man is innocent
he is innocent
a angel
this is no man
this is an angel
grenouille
you cant fool me
forgive me
my son
the people of grasse
awoke to a terrible hangover
for many of them
the experience was so ghastly
so completely inexplicable and
incompatible with their morals
that they literally erased it
from their memories
the town council was
in session by the afternoon
and an order was passed
to the police lieutenant
to immediately begin fresh
investigations into the murders
the following day
dominique druot was arrested
it was in his back yard that they
found the hair of the victims
after fourteen hours of torture
druot confessed to everything
with that the case was closed
by then grenouille was already
half way back to paris
he had enough perfume left to
enslave the world if he so chose
he could walk to versailles
and have the king kiss his feet
he could write the pope a letter
re veal himself as the new messiah
he could do all this
and more if he wanted to
he possessed a power stronger
than the power of money
or terror or death
the invincible power to command
the love of mankind
there was only one thing
the perfume could not do
it could not turn him
into a person
who could love and be loved
like everyone else
50 to hell with it he thought
to hell with the world
with the perfume
with himself
on the 25th of june 1766
around 110 clock at night
grenouille entered the city
through the port dorleans
and like a sleepwalker
his olfactory memories drew him
back to where he was born
a angel
i love you
within no time
jeanbaptiste grenouille
had disappeared from
the face of the earth
when they had finished they
felt a virginal glow of happiness
for the first time
in their lives
they believed that they
had done something
