and fourth slots from the left 
we ve done the same with one of these peel off
stickers  it goes right on the file folder 
now  each file folder needs to go
into its own pendaflex folder 
you have to make sure
it s the appropriate pendaflex folder 
wh why does it have to be on the inside
folder and the outside folder 
  the case number 
  yes 
because it s the key to
the entire system 
it also goes on the report 
all pages 
you punch it with
a two hole punch 
you attach it to the file folder
on this two prong fastener 
that way  nothing ever gets lost 
now  misdemeanours go in here 
and felonies go in there 
hey  plenty of room in there 
why do you think i m leavin   caseload
number s also on the daily caseload sheet 
and today  for example 
we have two    count  em  two    calls 
both of  em down at the pier 
if we drag our feet 
they can carry us through to lunch

this is not your room 
no slobbering 
no chewing 
you will wear a flea collar 
this is not your room 
no begging for food  no sniffing of crotches 
and you will not
drink from my toilet 
this is not your room 
this is your room 
the rest of the house is mine 
and when i come back into my house

where i put it 
everything in its place 
now  you don t touch my stuff

won t touch any of yours 
well  this is the room to do that 
this is your bed 
you follow these very simple rules   
and shut up 
we ll get along fine 
hey  scott 
so what does it tell you 
not much  i never read
an autopsy report before 
and i d just as soon
never read one again 
autopsy report s the cornerstone
of any homicide investigation 
this one tells us that the perpetrator
probably had special combat training 
  where did you see that 
  right here   the murder weapon penetrated the body   
 between the third and fourth ribs 
at an upward angle   
 entering the right lung
at a depth of two inches 
severing the pulmonary artery   
i read that  the victim was stabbed from
behind on the right side of the rib cage 
which would make
the killer right handed 
yeah  yeah 
but you re missing something 
now  you stab somebody in the heart 
they can still scream 
but you penetrate the lung 
they can t even let out a whisper 
they re trained to do that
in special forces 
well  that wasn t in the report 
how did you know that 
i m a professional investigator 
it s my business to know these things 
besides 
i called the coroner and he told me 
hey  fellas 
how much do you think we could get for
all of the furniture here in the office 
or i got a better idea  how about
