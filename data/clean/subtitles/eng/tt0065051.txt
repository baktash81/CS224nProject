i ain t really got
a whole lot to say about millard
because he only rode amongst us
two days ago 
and was promptly struck down
by whatever deadly disease
it was struck him down 
we can only hope
that whatever deadly disease it was
it wasn t particularly contagious 
and with that in mind  i suggest
we all bow our heads in devout prayer 
heavenly father  we hereby consign
to your tender mercies all that remains   
get out 
all that remains of one millard frymore 
origin unknown 
cause of death unknown 
and of considerable concern to those
of us thrown into contact with him
during the last two days 
millard was struck down in what
was evidently the prime of his life 
in fact  he was took from us so fast
he never even got a chance
to unpack his suitcase 
however  inasmuch as we were the last
to know poor millard here on earth 
and in so far as we were all drawn
to this godforsaken country
in search of a common goal 
i m certain you will agree with me   
  hey  pa    pa   
  what is the matter with you 
  take a look 
  ain t you got no reverence for anything 
  gold 
  what 
take a look  it s gold 
i remind everyone we are here to
consign the remains of millard frymore 
  it s gold  henry 
  gold 
down there in the grave 
  let s get this coffin out and have a look 
  oh  no  you don t 
get out of my gold mine 
get out of my gold mine 
  we re gonna be rich 
  get out of my gold mine   
gold  gold  gold 
it doesn t seem possible
that a town could get in this condition
in the short time it s been in existence 
lynchings  gunfights 
and that drunken revelry going on
at madame orr s house 24 hours a day 
a decent woman
is not safe on these streets 
oh  i think the women are safe enough
for the most part 
we only got a couple
that would be much interest to anyone 
outside the dance hall girls and they re
good at handling themselves in a pinch 
or in a ticklish situation 
well  now  this may be very funny
to the members of the town council 
we mine owners haven t found anything
to laugh at since we started in business 
we don t think it s funny  tom 
we just don t know what to do about it 
maybe what we need is a new mayor
and a town council that does know 
what kinda talk is that  the only reason
i m mayor and the others councilmen
is nobody else wanted the jobs 
don t forget  tom 
we re all mine owners ourselves 
do you enjoy giving 20 per cent of
everything you mine to the danby family 
  why would we enjoy it 
  all right  let s do something about it 
what  you all know the situation 
us in calendar 
there s galena  where we ship our gold 
there s the danby ranch in between the
two  the road runs through their property 
then we build the road
around their property 
how  they own that whole valley 
if they don t get their 20 per cent  they
just hold up every stage and take all of it 
all right  but we ve got to do something 
even if it means bringing troops in here 
  troops 
  troops 
what troops  from where 
the nearest troops are 500 miles 
  then we recruit our own 
  we can t recruit enough dishwashers 
how will we recruit troops 
nobody wants to stop prospecting
long enough to take a bath 
it all happened so fast we ain t had
a chance to get organised yet 
  the danbys are takin  advantage of it 
  there goes one of  em now 
  which one is he 
  joe 
out of the father and brothers 
he s second toughest 
  they all act like they own the place 
  the way things are now  they do 
it s gonna stay that way
until we find ourselves a sheriff
that doesn t turn tail and run
the minute someone takes a shot at him 
whiskey 
all right  you all saw it 
and it was a fair fight 
he drew first 
so it was self defence 
he drew first  sure as anything 
you couldn t call it anything
but self defence 
it may have been a lot of things 
but self defence it wasn t 
and he didn t draw first  you did 
  what do you mean by that 
  oh  it s an old trick  you did it pretty well 
not real well  but pretty well 
you feinted with your left shoulder
gettin  him to go for his gun
while you were going for yours
with your right hand 
it s an old arizona trick  but i have
seen it used as far north as montana 
  are you callin  me a liar 
  you heard every word i said 
all i said was you feinted him into drawing
while you were going for your gun 
  so what 
  you beat that poor man to the draw 
he s dead and you re alive 
that s the whole idea of the game 
  what s your name 
  jason mccullough 
  what s yours 
  joe danby 
  and you had better remember it 
  oh  i ll remember it  joe 
it s about all i ll do the rest of my life 
remember your name 
the bread s on the table in front of you 
why  you 
is this one of emma s
tasty home cooked meals 
  that s it  mister 
  they charge  3 for this  huh 
that s what they call inflation  sometimes
it catches you right in between mouthfuls 
is there really any gold in this town 
  how long did it take you to get that 
  yesterday afternoon 
a good part of this morning 
where could a man find a place to sleep 
if you mean a room  you can t  down
at the end of the street  you get a cot 
  how much 
   20  eight hour shift 
say a man was willing to go to work to
get himself a stake  how d he go about it 
  you don t want a job 
  no 
i figure the way prices are around here 
i ll go broke about 2 30 this afternoon 
we got a bulletin board with that
kinda stuff down at the assay office 
thank you 
hold it  hold it 
ok  go ahead 
fight 
yee hah 
  get the hell out of my way 
  heck  go around 
i told you get outta there 
what did i tell you 
watch where you re grabbing 
  what about you 
  what about me 
  you wanna grab something 
  everything looks too slippery 
  what does that mean 
  nothing 
you look too clean to suit me 
are you the man i talk to about   
  wait your turn  mister 
    the job of sheriff 
  you interested in the job of sheriff 
  well  maybe 
  how much does it pay 
  no sheriff lived long enough to find out 
look  boys  why don t you go outside
and watch the fight  the ladies too 
very good fight out there 
you can watch it too  sam 
ok  come on 
let s get out  get moving  come on 
all right  let s go 
i m olly perkins  the mayor here 
jason mccullough 
fred johnson 
henry jackson  tom devery 
original settlers  fred and henry
are members of the town council 
  i represent the mine owners 
  nice to meet you 
what that fella said a minute ago
ain t strictly true 
we ve had three sheriffs the past
two months  but only two got killed 
  what about the other one 
  he quit  kinda sudden like 
i don t think
he had the right temperament 
you never have said
anything about the pay 
well  for the right kinda man 
 150 a month 
with the spiralling prices around here 
that d only allow a man to eat
and sleep about eight days a month 
  the job includes room and board 
  not at emma s tasty food emporium 
at my house 
my daughter does the cooking 
gentlemen  it s only fair to tell you i d only
be interested on a temporary basis 
oh 
i was on my way to australia
when i heard about your gold strike
and i decided to travel through here
to see if i could pick up a little stake 
  what do you want to go to australia for 
  it s the last frontier country 
  i thought i might do a bit of pioneering 
  i thought we was pioneers 
  so did i 
  to get back to the sheriff s job 
if i take it  it s with the understanding i get
time off to do the prospecting i came for 
well  you ain t said nothing yet
about your qualifications for the job 
don t worry about that 
if i take it  you ll be glad 
it ain t just a question of taking the job  it s
also a question of being able to handle it 
olly  we ain t in much of a position
to be choosy 
him talking about it at all
certainly shows the right attitude 
i don t care what it shows  as mayor 
it s my responsibility to hire us a sheriff
that s not only got qualifications
but ain t gonna get killed
the first time he sticks
his nose out of the door 
there you go 
  what s your point 
  just an exhibition of marksmanship 
  the bullet went through the hole 
  maybe it did  maybe it didn t 
  oh  it did  take my word for it 
  i d like to take your word but   
would you mind doing it again 
mr mccullough 
  you want me to do it again 
  if you don t mind 
  well  i already shot one hole in your roof 
  that s all right 
i hope you didn t take offence
at nothing i said earlier  sir 
no  gentlemen 
just to keep the record straight  now 
 150 a month
and the room and board is fine 
but i ve got to do my prospecting 
i m on my way to australia 
you just name your terms  mister 
we ll rush to meet  em 
fine  as long as everything is straight 
is there some kind of badge with this job 
oh  you bet there is 
  i m afraid it s a little bent up 
  that saved the life of whoever wore it 
it would have if it wasn t for all them
other bullets flyin  in from everywhere 
gentlemen 
  do we have a jail here 
  do we have a jail 
a brand new one with two cells that
the whole community built last month 
even the dance hall girls showed up 
made sandwiches and carried on 
it was designed
to be practically escape proof 
good  because i m gonna have
to throw a couple of people in it 
  there s one thing  it s got everything 
  even a new stove with a coffee pot 
the only thing it hasn t got
is iron bars for the cells 
you re kiddin  
we had to send away for  em
and they ain t arrove yet 
it s got glass windows and brooms
and kerosene lamps  you name it 
  just no bars for the cells 
  right 
  well  all right  i ll think of something 
  you ain t wanted for anything anywhere 
not that it matters  we understand
how them little things can happen 
no  i m not wanted for anything anywhere 
you realise the chance you was taking
asking him that 
he might have took offence 
i m the mayor and i got responsibilities 
the question had to be asked 
mr mayor  if i could get
a few men on this pump over here 
i think we could stop this thing 
sure thing  sheriff  give us a hand  men 
all right  men  let her go 
a little more 
break it up 
ok  cut it 
  what are you tryin  to do 
  stoppin  a fight 
  who are you 
  i m the new sheriff 
oh  we got a new sheriff 
let s see if he scares
as easy as the last sheriff 
i want all you people to quit disturbing
the peace and clean up this mess 
yes  sir  anything else 
  you got a name 
  jake 
right  jake  i want you
to go into the mint saloon 
there s a fella in there
by the name of joe danby 
tell him i remember his name 
he s under arrest for murder 
i ll be in to pick him up in not 20 minutes 
  you talkin  to me 
  you hard of hearing 
you want me to tell joe danby
that he s under arrest for murder 
  what about after he kills me 
  i ll arrest him for both murders 
  where s the jail 
  just follow me  sheriff 
you won t find a better jail
for 200 miles 
that is  if he can find one at all 
  everything seems to be in order 
  our last sheriff was a good organiser 
yellow clear through 
but a good organiser 
we should be getting the bars in
any day now 
  that oughta do it 
  that oughta do what  sheriff 
that oughta take care of it
till we get the bars in 
i ve got my bedroll and other things
over at the stable 
i ll pick them up  then settle in
where i m gonna stay 
i got a nice room for you at my house 
shall we go over there 
then i can pick up that danby fella 
there is something you better know
about the danbys 
why bother the sheriff
about that stuff now 
  but  fred   
  we can fill him in after he settles in 
  you comin   mayor 
  i ll be right with you  sheriff 
this is like murder 
i hope you know that 
just cos we ve lost three sheriffs
don t mean we re gonna lose four 
  our luck is bound to change 
  what about his luck 
prudy  prudy 
  just put your things over there 
  all righty 
prudy 
i want you to meet my daughter  sheriff 
a good cook  mighty fine lookin  girl 
takes after her dear  departed mother 
  mother died  huh 
  no  she just departed 
come on  sheriff 
i ll show you the parlour 
that little organ 
that came all the way from düsseldorf 
the furniture was shipped
through st louis and chicago 
  this desk is where i do my mayor work 
  very nice 
i guess you could say
this is about the finest house in town 
let me show you the dining room 
that s where you ll be having your meals 
prudy  i want you to meet someone 
  this is the dining room 
  you sure have a nice place here 
thank you  sheriff  a drink 
  water  if you have some 
  water 
sure thing 
we ve got a pump inside the kitchen 
inside the house 
there s the pump 
sheriff 
before you go down
to arrest joe danby 
a couple of things you oughta know 
  all right 
  the danbys  there s four of them 
father and three sons 
all of  em pretty tough customers 
  outlaws 
  no  not exactly 
but in many ways 
you might say they re like outlaws 
  how s that 
  they do pretty much as they like 
and they get real nasty
when anybody tries to stop  em 
you mean   
you mean you don t want me
to arrest this boy 
no  not at all  it s just it s a new idea 
takes a little bit of getting used to 
i stood there in that saloon and watched
him gun a man down in cold blood 
oh  i believe you  sheriff  it s just
the kind of thing you d expect joe to do 
  but are you sure it wasn t self defence 
  not a chance 
sometimes them things happen so fast 
it didn t happen all that fast 
look  mr perkins 
you re the mayor of this town  if you order
me not to arrest this man  you re the boss 
i ll have to give you this badge back 
cos that is no way to run a town  mayor 
i couldn t agree with you more 
furthermore  i ll expect all the law abiding
citizens to back me up in this job 
they will  sheriff  well  maybe
not all of them  not right at first 
you see  it s like i told you 
i m just on my way to australia 
you go ahead
and do what you think is best 
i d better go and alert everybody   
we re all behind you  sheriff 
don t give it another thought 
you don t need any help with joe danby 
  no  i can handle it 
  oh  good  good 
  you re the strangest girl i ever met 
  go away 
do you always show this side of your
nature or am i just lucky on my first day 
i suppose you have some reason
for sitting up there like that 
ordinarily  a girl doesn t get undressed 
pour a bucket of water over her head 
then climb a tree 
i m warnin  you   
  hi  mrs danvers 
  what in the world    
prudy  is this man bothering you 
  do you know this young lady 
  of course 
that s prudy perkins 
she lives here in this house 
does she have any past history
of strange behaviour like this 
why  no  prudy s always been
a sweet  normal  loveable   
of course 
there were a couple of times last year 
what happened last year 
it wasn t really anything 
the annual town picnic  she got
her hair caught in the ice cream freezer 
i think we ought to be merciful and forget
about this whole unfortunate incident 
good day  ma am 
sheriff  i didn t go down there
and tell joe like you asked 
  why not 
  nobody s paying me to take chances 
you never know
how that joe is gonna react 
why should you worry what joe thinks 
cos he s mean  sheriff  and he s nasty 
he enjoys killin  people 
  all them danbys enjoy things like that 
  you re faster than joe 
  who says so 
  i do  i ve seen you both draw 
you re faster than he is 
supposing it s true 
why should the matter ever come up 
jake   
how would you like the job as my deputy 
i d hate it 
even if i lived through it  i d hate it 
i don t know how much they re paying you
but you gotta believe me  it ain t enough 
he s expecting you  some of these
other people told him you was coming 
i hear you re gonna try and arrest me 
you don t look near as tough
as those other sheriffs we ve had lately 
particularly that old boy who done run off
an hour and a half after he took the job 
joe  you just make me feel tired all over
when you talk like that 
now  what do you mean by that 
it s bad enough to have to kill a man
without having to listen
to a whole lot of stupid talk from him first 
and remember  joe  i ve seen you draw 
all right  sheriff  hold it 
now  drop your gun belt 
  i couldn t let him shoot you in the back 
  oh  you could have 
is this the kind of town you people
want for yourselves  this kind of life 
three killings in one saloon alone
and the sun hasn t even gone down yet 
any more of this foolishness 
i ll close this place up tight 
  yes  sir  i wouldn t blame you a bit  sir 
  pick it up  joe  go on  pick it up 
i m gonna get you for this  jake 
you are the toughest talkin  blowhard
i ever heard 
you might as well come on  whether you
like it or not  we re on the same side now 
come on  joe 
take it easy  boys  me and the sheriff
takes a dim view of show offs with guns 
remember 
no more shooting till the sun goes down 
  is that what he said 
  close enough 
drinks are on the house 
jake  why don t you look around the desk
and see if you can find a deputy s badge 
i never said i was taking no job
as a deputy 
you re tryin  to corner me into this 
i m surprised
at what s happening to me too 
i was just ridin  through on my way
to australia    where are you going 
  this is just plain stupid 
  are you callin  the sheriff stupid 
do i have to listen to him 
he s the town character 
was the town character 
i m now deputy sheriff and probably
the second fastest gun around here 
  did you hear that 
  he probably is 
if he isn t  he will be after i have a chance
to work with him for a couple of days 
come on  joe 
joe  the cell on the right here is yours 
we don t have any bars yet 
  you re kiddin  
  that s what i said 
but we re going to operate
just as if the bars were there 
you stay on that side of the line
and everything should work out fine 
what 
while you re in this jail 
you stay on that side of the line
and you and i will get along fine 
you expect me to sit here
in this lousy cell    
what is that red stuff
all over the floor there 
oh  that s the poor fella
that crossed the line earlier today 
now  joe  you just stay right there
and behave yourself 
  maybe if you wanted something to read 
  read 
no  i guess you wouldn t 
sorry 
  well  i see you found a badge 
  yeah 
are we gonna set out
to clean up this town 
  i guess that s about it 
  all by ourselves 
not that we d turn down any help
cheerfully offered 
nobody is gonna offer no help 
cheerful or any other way 
i think you re probably right  jake 
how much money
am i makin  in this job 
well  let s see  i m the sheriff
and they re paying me  150 a month 
shall we put your salary
at about half that  plus room and board 
plus all the ammunition you need
to carry on the job 
of course  i haven t checked out your
employment with the mayor and council 
  you mean they might turn me down 
  i don t think so 
no  i think their attitude is going to be 
if we found somebody cra    willing
to take the job  don t rock the boat 
you can bet
that s what their attitude s gonna be 
ever been sheriff of a town
that needed cleanin  up 
  no  i haven t 
  ever been the sheriff of any town 
no  not that either  but the mayor seemed
to think my qualifications suited the job 
he d have thought that if you was blind
in both eyes and crippled in both legs 
i think you ve got
the situation pegged  jake 
  want me to warm some coffee 
  i never turn down a cup of coffee 
  how long you been out west 
  about four years 
  from where 
  east 
  i was raised up in indiana 
  well  that could be either good or bad 
them four years you been out west 
what you been doin  
well  mostly 
i ve been on my way to australia 
  for four years 
  it takes some people longer than others 
  what s in australia 
  a lot of things  you d be surprised 
  any other questions  jake 
  oh  i    there s no   
no  it s all right  if there s anything i want 
it s a deputy who s at ease in his mind 
well  you ain t got one 
i don t know where you re gonna
get one in this town  either 
  why australia 
  you d know if you d read a book about it 
  i ain t never even seen a book about it 
  they got one in the library in chicago 
if you re ever up that way 
take a look at it 
they got pictures  everything 
they got little people over there  like that 
they got a stick that when they
throw it away  it comes back at  em 
they got some animals there   
they got one that hops  it ll box you 
it carries things in its tummy 
when you shot
that friend of joe s in the back 
you fired two shots 
i figure they went in  oh   
about that far apart  huh 
pretty sloppy shootin   jake 
i was in a hurry to save your life 
i wasn t trying to group my shots 
if you d been five feet further away 
you d have missed him entirely 
i d say that was
a pretty pitiful showing  jake 
  you see that bottom nail on the right 
  yeah 
  that s weird 
  what s weird 
  that anybody can shoot like that 
  just a matter of practice 
how come nobody ever heard of you 
a man that can shoot like that 
  how come you ain t got a reputation 
  what would i want with a reputation 
that s a good way to get yourself killed 
you just go on practisin 
while i put joe back in jail 
joe 
i took the bullets out 
you just won t play the game  will you 
i keep layin  down the rules 
you don t pay any attention 
just wait till my pa and two brothers
find out you ve got me in here 
i m lookin  forward
to meeting your whole family 
go on 
it s bad enough i was dragged
out of that saloon in front of my friends 
oh  i doubt if you have all that many
friends that you need to be upset  joe 
and then i have to sit there
in that lousy cell 
pa is gonna skin me alive
for getting caught 
he won t mind you murderin  that man 
he just doesn t like you gettin  caught 
i didn t murder anybody 
that was self defence  it was him or me 
well  we ll let the judge decide that 
we do have a judge around here 
never needed one till you come to town
and ruined everything 
  spoiled all your fun  huh  joe 
  you can say that again 
that s funny   
that s real funny 
i hope you ain t got no religious
convictions against drinking 
not since i gave up my parish 
i m only kidding  mayor 
  mayor  what about my deputy 
  no problem 
  i m curious as to why you picked jake 
  jake backed me up when it counted 
i d have to wait and find that out about
another man  then it might be too late 
how about a judge 
the need for one
ain t exactly been felt up to now 
  that s what joe said 
  if i can t appoint one  who can 
some show you put on
at the saloon this afternoon 
  kind of sobered up the whole town 
  that s good 
maybe  maybe not 
it has been a lot of fun here up to now 
everything kinda wide open and relaxed 
nobody lookin  down their noses
at anybody who shot somebody else 
poking their noses
into nobody s business
without getting their big noses
blasted off in the process 
i guess now that we ve got law and order 
churches will start movin  in 
that s usually the next thing 
then the women will start forming
committees  having bazaars 
then they ll chase madame orr s girls
outta town or make  em get married 
but what the hell  like you said  the law s
the law and we all gotta face up to it 
  when did i say that 
  you know what i mean 
well  i was just short of money
when you offered me this job 
but you didn t have to take it  i mean 
there s dozens of other jobs around 
well  don t worry about it 
i m not going to keep it too long 
i m just passin  through
on my way to australia 
i ll drink to that 
argh 
  what are you    
  you was on fire  prudy  you was on fire 
fire 
oh   
i m sick and tired of these stupid things
that have been happenin  to me 
and somebody d better
do something about it soon 
  that s quite a daughter you got 
  i think she s crazy 
why would you think that 
i know why i d think   
she had some shocks this year  she got
wealthy overnight  it unhinged her 
then she was always big for her age
and puberty hit her hard  that ll do it 
  i didn t know that 
  well  it will 
as a disinterested stranger 
how does she hit you 
  well  she   
  you are disinterested  ain t you 
oh  i think you could safely say that 
she s a rich gal in her own name  sheriff 
sole owner of the millard frymore
memorial mining company 
  whoever marries her gets the mine 
  shaft and all 
yeah  well  that won t hurt her
in certain circles  will it 
i better fry us up something to eat 
no  thank you  i better go down and
relieve jake  this is his first night on duty 
  you expectin  trouble 
  what do you think 
the danbys  some people think
you could ve waited a couple of days
before you stuck your nose
in our biggest hornet nest 
when you set out to clean up a mess 
you don t watch that mess get bigger 
i guess you know what you re doin  
i don t know what i could ve said
to give you that idea  mayor 
puberty 
you gonna stick to your plan of
handling this by yourself  are you  pa 
since when did it take more than one
danby to take care of a thing like this 
you know what a tiger you are 
you re liable to go chargin  in there   
  and what 
  nothing  i didn t mean nothing 
you ain t got brains enough
to mean nothing 
you two go in here
and order yourselves a drink 
i ll be back with joe
before you can finish  em 
i believe you ve got one of my children
in your jail here 
how dare you walk into my office
and pull a gun on me 
  get your finger out of the end of my gun 
  how dare you pull a gun on me 
i said take your finger out 
until i do  take your finger off that trigger
and let the hammer down real slow 
if that went off 
it d have blown up in my face 
it wouldn t have done my finger
a hell of a lot of good  either 
  what can i do for you  mr danby 
  my son joe 
well  it seems joe
murdered a man this afternoon 
i heard he killed a man
in a fair gunfight 
  i was standin  right there 
  standin  right where 
in the saloon when joe killed him 
well  now  that was
real smart of him  wasn t it 
i ve been around joe all afternoon 
i haven t seen him do one smart thing yet 
  anything else 
  can i see him 
why didn t you take that approach
when you came in  in there 
i m obliged to you 
  hi  pa 
  what is this 
no bars on the window 
no bars in the cell 
no bars nowhere 
  what s keepin  you in here 
  that guy out there 
he won t let me move
without jumpin  down my throat 
besides  he lies to me
about whether my gun is loaded 
  he does what 
  are you gonna get me outta here or not 
never mind that  who was it you killed 
i don t know his name 
he was some bum in the saloon 
besides  he drew first  are you gonna
believe me or that liar out there 
  why don t you shut up 
  it wasn t anybody that we know 
pa  you always told me there wasn t
a jail that could hold a danby 
  well  now they built one 
  oh   
you ll have to stay here
for a couple of days 
but we run this town 
i gotta throw in with that sheriff that
you don t dazzle with your intelligence 
now  you just sit tight here till i ve had
a chance to think this thing out 
couldn t you do it
when he weren t lookin  
he wasn t the sheriff
when he done seen me do it 
i didn t think of that before  that could be
a loophole to get me out of here 
don t you try to do nothing about this
situation  leave that to me and the boys 
  that s a lousy jail you got in there 
  we re just gettin  started 
  what s he supposed to be 
  that s my deputy 
last week  he was shovelling horse   
working in the stable 
well  he s been promoted 
i m gonna find out
what s happened to this town 
what did danby want 
oh   
he just came in and we talked a while 
he went in to see joe 
he came back out 
we talked a little more  then he left 
you know   
  he strikes me as being a lonely man 
  lonely  danby 
he s a mean  no good 
low down bushwhacker 
well  now  there  you see 
no wonder he s lonely 
he stuck his finger in your what 
would you shut up 
everybody will be lookin  
i don t understand what happened 
you said you had your gun on him 
i ain t gonna explain it again 
i don t have to explain nothing to you two 
instead of sittin  here askin  questions 
why don t you come up with suggestions 
why don t the three of us go over there 
i don t care
if he is the fastest gun anywhere 
  who says he s the fastest gun 
  everybody 
that s all they re talkin  about
all over town 
  what could he do against three of us 
  he could kill two of us 
you ain t talkin  like yourself  pa 
you always charge in
and we hold you back 
  we ain t gonna leave joe to get hung 
  well  of course we ain t 
who says we gotta
take care of the sheriff 
who says anybody has to  why don t we
run him outta town like the last sheriff 
because this one won t go 
he didn t throw a scare into you 
did he  pa 
i didn t mean that the way it sounded 
i just meant   
well  what did he do to you  pa 
he maybe made me
a little more thoughtful 
he maybe made me realise that now
we ve got a little money for the first time
and a chance to get a lot more 
this would be a dumb time
to find out who s fastest with a gun  
us or some show off that might be lucky
even if he weren t good 
  if we don t take care of him  who does 
  there s always some tramp to be hired 
but you always said that
the danbys fight their own battles 
maybe i was talkin 
about another branch of the family 
i m gonna take a little trip tomorrow  you
two behave yourselves while i m gone 
i don t want nobody to make
no martyr out of this here sheriff 
  what s a martyr 
  i m sorry 
they didn t use words like that
in the third grade  did they 
  how would i know  i didn t get that far 
  ah 
you remember when i was stuck
all them years in the second grade 
shut up 
sheriff 
can i talk to you a minute 
sure  miss prudy 
could    could we sit down 
sure 
well   
  how can i be of service  miss prudy 
  what 
  how can i be of service 
  what do you mean  service 
i don t mean anything by it 
what do you think i mean 
look  i m just a dumb little girl from a hick
town in a jerkwater part of the country 
what 
nothing  you said
you were dumb little girl   
i know what i said 
i wanted to explain some of those
stupid  silly things you saw me doing 
  what stupid  silly things  miss prudy 
  what stupid    
  how about when i burned my dress off 
  that could happen to anyone 
how about in the mud when i was trying
to defend myself from that    pervert 
that s just one of those things that any
overstimulated girl might get caught into 
how about up in the tree 
half naked  drippin  wet 
that one could take a little explanation 
well  it was one of those days
when everything goes wrong 
actually  every one
of those ridiculous things
has a perfectly simple explanation 
not that it matters  i just thought
it was dumb to have such an   
attractive man thinking
i was a hopeless loony 
well  loony maybe  but hopeless   
you   
  you think i m attractive 
  well   
i don t think a girl would curl up and die
because you smiled at her 
but  yes  i think you re attractive 
well  miss prudy  i can see
that you re a young lady
who believes in laying
her cards on the table 
  in what 
  laying your cards on the table 
when a girl does that  i think that a man
should lay his cards on the table too 
anybody can see that you re
a very pretty and very attractive girl 
any man in his right mind would be
only too glad to take you out on a picnic
or out for a walk in the evening 
well  i d feel privileged to do just that 
however  if you re thinking of anything
more serious  i m on my way to australia 
  i m just passing through here 
  why  you conceited   
i m only telling you
that i m on my way to australia 
who cares where you re on your way to 
any girl who was thinking of a permanent
relationship would be glad to know   
i m not thinking of entering into   
one of those 
  what s the matter with you 
  you think something is 
do i think     there isn t enough time
to tell you how much 
good night 
  you all right  miss prudy 
  shut up and mind your own business 
  damn  damn  damn 
  prudy 
you shut up too 
well  do you see anything 
no  what are we lookin  for 
what are we lookin  for 
nuggets  veins  the mother lode 
what s the mother lode 
i m beginning to get the feeling you know
less about gold mining than i do 
of course i don t know about gold mining 
why do you think i brought you along 
everyone around here knows about it 
i don t  i might be able to give you
a few tips about shovelling horse   
working around a stable  but i don t
know nothing about huntin  gold 
  mind if i put this stuff down 
  no  you better not 
if i know anything about prospecting 
you gotta keep on the move 
pity 
well  here 
let me redistribute the weight for you 
i feel like a jackass 
there  that oughta do it 
  come on  jack 
  jake 
you re a pretty good fisherman  jake 
  this is more like it  huh 
  more like what 
this is more like the kinda place
i want to go gold minin  in 
what makes you think
there s any gold here 
what makes you think there isn t 
it don t bother you none that joe is gonna
be miles away by the time we get back 
not unless he s learned to travel fast
handcuffed to a potbellied stove 
  what do we do now 
  i think we oughta have lunch 
take a little rest 
and then you start diggin  
hey  jake  how do you think
we oughta split whatever we find 
60 40 
60 for who and 40 for who 
there  you see 
see what gold does to men 
we haven t even found anything
and already we re arguing 
60 for who and 40 for who 
i just wish you could see
the greed in your face 
what you mean is 60 for you
and 40 for me 
well  thank you  jake 
that s very generous of you 
hey  jake 
jake  what did you do
before you became my deputy 
i did odd jobs 
like what 
i was a whore holder
at madame horse s   
a horse holder at madame orr s house 
  you were a what 
  horse holder 
see  on saturday night 
that hitch rack would get full 
i d hold the extra horses 
sometimes all night 
it seems to me like you spent
a lot of time with horses 
one end or the other 
course  i come by it natural  my daddy
stole horses for a livin   they hung him 
that s a terrible thing for a sheriff
to suddenly find out about his deputy 
if you hadn t shoved
this job down my throat 
you might have found out a lot of things 
  want my badge back 
  don t be silly 
jake  you better clean up those fish 
i ll take a little nap 
  sure i won t disturb you none 
  no  just don t rattle the pots and pans 
i ll be wantin  you boys to ride into town
more quietly from now on 
  you drove your point home real good 
  good  good 
well  that kind of brightens up
the whole place 
at least i don t feel so naked and stupid
sitting in here day after day 
joe  if jake comes in  tell him
i went down to the store to see the mayor 
  have you seen my daddy 
  no 
not since the night he came in here
and we had that little chat 
don t you worry  joe 
i m sure he s planning a little jailbreak 
  you really think so 
  what else would they be doing 
where will i find the sheriff 
i imagine he s in the jail   
no 
wait a minute  there he is
comin  out of the hardware store there 
  much obliged 
  pleasure 
sheriff 
  anybody know who he was 
  i think he just rode into town 
he asked me where you was 
i seen you coming out of the hardware   
thanks for pointin  me out to him 
hold it just a minute 
you don t want to go in there right now 
wait here just a minute 
i ll come back and i ll join you 
honey  i think i just been   
  ever see him before 
  uh uh 
jake 
after lunch   
  afternoon  sheriff 
  we ain t makin  any dust at all today 
  another one of  em rode into town 
  you sure 
can t miss a professional gunfighter 
they got a look ain t like anyone else 
he s been askin  around to find you 
  i m sure gettin  sick of all this stuff 
  this stuff would make me sick too 
well   
why do these jaspers
always have to hit town at mealtime 
  are you gonna kill another man 
  i m sure we all hope it turns out that way 
this sure is a childish way
for a grown man to make a living 
  go for your gun  sheriff 
  you go to hell 
and stay out 
if either one of you
opens his fat  stupid mouth 
i ll chase you right out of town
after that other yellow dog 
leave the bottle 
  all right  now he s done it 
  who 
  that sheriff 
  what s he done 
he s pushed me too far this time 
that s what he s done 
i ve been bending over backwards
up to now  that s all finished 
you know i ve bent over backwards 
you ain t let him push you into no corner
where you could be provoked 
right  but from now on 
i m tired of being a nice fella 
pa  have you been
touchin  up your hair again 
  what do you mean  again 
  nothing 
  it just looks better in spots  that s all 
  what do you mean 
nothing 
what are we gonna do  pa 
  get joe out of jail 
  how 
leave that to me  i got it all figured out 
we ll do it tonight 
you get ready 
cos this is gonna happen awful fast 
  pa 
  huh 
nothing  it s all right 
when i yell go  we all go together 
and use your spurs  all ready  yah 
  now he s really done it 
  who 
that sheriff 
  i could ve told you it wouldn t work 
  why not 
because they set these bars in too solid 
  what do you know about anything 
  i helped to set  em in 
you    
luke  i want you two
to round up the horses 
ride over to your uncle milt s  tell him
to bring steve and george and young milt 
and  tom  you ride out to uncle ira s 
you tell him to bring billy and jack
and anyone else he can think to bring 
  i ain t foolin  around no longer 
  that s a two day ride 
i know far it is  stop at the ranch
and pick up some grub 
tell milt and ira we ll all meet friday 
if any of them feel
that they don t wanna come 
you just remind them of the mortgages
i help them to pay 
well  all right  get going 
  you helped  em put in those bars 
  i didn t have nothin  else to do 
they was gonna put the bars in
whether i helped or not 
they ll hang you
whether you helped or not 
pa  i don t think
that they are really gonna hang me 
they laugh and they joke 
but i don t think they ll do it 
  you ll see whether they hang you or   
  don t move 
  what s goin  on back here 
  that s all i need 
some stable bum orderin  me around 
this is my saddle
and i m taking it with me 
i know it ain t mine  so go ahead 
in just a few days now 
i ll take care of you 
what was he tryin  to do 
bust you outta here 
yeah 
you know pa 
got a heart as big as the whole outdoors 
but he don t have one brain
in his poor old head 
may i compliment you on getting
such a romantic idea  miss prudy 
nothing romantic about it  sheriff 
nothing romantic about a man and a girl
out for a ride on a warm afternoon 
you think what you want to  sheriff 
but you d do that anyway  wouldn t you 
it s surprising how well you ve gotten
to know me in such a short time 
would you like to get out
and talk a minute  sheriff 
all right 
light yourself up a cigar
if you want to  sheriff 
thank you  miss prudy  i believe i will 
was there anything in particular that
you wanna talk to me about  miss prudy 
in case you didn t know  milt danby
is rounding up his two brothers
and all of their sons
and all of their hired hands 
they re gonna ride into town
and take care of you 
  they re gonna get joe out of jail 
  yeah  i heard about that 
we ve all been trying to remember 
we think there are three grown boys
in ira danby s family
and two in milt danby s family 
so with the three danbys here 
and joe in jail 
we figure that makes about 11 
plus all of the hired hands
that they bring along 
that s about the figure i arrived at too 
  ten or 12  maybe 
  or 14 or 15  maybe 
  it s quite a few 
  it s almost a mob  you might say 
have you figured what you re gonna do 
  more or less 
  what 
i thought i might just leave town 
just get outta town before they ride in 
just ride out and keep on going 
  i don t believe it 
  i don t know why not 
i ve never made any secret of the fact
that basically i m on my way to australia 
i don t think i m gonna find
a better time to get started than now 
besides  i don t like the odds 
i just don t believe it 
you better believe it  it s not gonna be
too many hours before i m long gone 
i think that is one of the most mature
things i ve ever heard of a man doing 
you think it s what 
mature 
any other man would have to stick around
to prove that they are a man
and get a whole town shot up to boot 
mature 
as opposed to childish
and shot full of holes 
you don t think it sounded
a little cowardly 
for a man to take a job and then
when the going gets a little rough 
he just sneaks out in the dead of night 
you didn t say whether it was day or night 
but the point is  didn t it sound
a little cowardly to you 
no  i told you  it sounds mature 
it sounded cowardly to me
just now when i said it 
it isn t  it s mature 
i know it s cowardly 
i have never done a cowardly thing 
no matter what you
or anybody else thinks 
  i didn t say i thought   
  it isn t mature  it is cowardly 
let s just call things
by their right name from now on 
what is the matter with you 
i m surprised at a girl who throws herself
at a man when she thinks he s a coward 
but   
what do you mean  throwing myself 
did you think that i was gonna turn tail
and run at the first sight of trouble 
  why shouldn t i  that s what you said 
  well  i m not  so you just forget about it 
all right  order  order 
you all heard the motion 
those in favour  raise your hands 
  count them  henry 
  one  two  three  four  five 
now  those in favour
of not getting involved
in the crisis which is
about to befall our fair community 
keepin  the hell off the streets and out of
the way of the shooting  raise your hands 
  count  em  henry 
  five  ten  fifteen 
i think we ve passed that motion 
order  order 
be it so entered in the books
of the town council
that the majority has ruled 
and as your mayor   
  i object 
  get that gun away from her 
  oh  you can t do this 
  you just shut up and sit down  prudy 
this is a meeting of the town council
and certain citizens of this community 
you can t just walk in off the street
and insult everyone 
just one question  how many of you
will help the sheriff against the danbys 
  it s not as simple as that  prudy 
  why not 
there are other factors 
economic factors 
it could affect the wellbeing
of everyone in this town 
i heard that the sheriff was leaving town 
at the time i heard it  i said to myself
 that sheriff has his head
set squarely on his shoulders   
now he s not gonna leave town 
i d like to get my hands on whoever
caused him to change his mind 
me too  a man with that good an idea
oughta be encouraged to hold onto it 
what is the matter with you 
remember how long we waited for a man
who would stand up to the danbys 
remember what this town
was like before  murderin   lynchin  
miners shootin  up the town
day and night 
aside from those few things 
it wasn t a bad place at all 
sure  we had a little misunderstanding
with the danbys at times 
  they could all be worked out in time 
  joe danby s in jail for murder 
that would ve solved itself too if the
sheriff had left town like he promised to 
i said it before and i ll say it again 
the men in this town are nothing but
a bunch of low down  cowardly curs 
as your father 
i may have to take that talk from you 
but as the mayor of this town 
i sure as hell don t 
throw her out  boys 
and don t be too gentle with her 
don t let her tie herself to that post 
it s a trick of hers  tying herself to things
when she doesn t want to do something 
  death to all tyrants 
  what did she say 
death to somebody  she s always saying
death to somebody she s mad at 
order 
forget about gettin  help
from anybody in this town 
  or from anybody for 100 miles around 
  that takes care of just about everybody 
they can throw a girl out of a meeting 
but they can t defend their town against
a bunch of cutthroats like the danbys 
what are we gonna do now 
  we 
  don t turn down any help you can get 
  how s joe 
  he figures we ll be dead tomorrow 
did he seem to feel any sorrow
over the fact that we might all be killed 
no  it s more like he planned to dance
and spit all over our graves 
  sounds like joe 
  sure was a good idea  leavin  town 
  you don t have to stay 
  yes  i do  i gotta stay if you do 
  i took the job 
  so did i 
i ll tell you what  i ll even go to australia
with you if we leave right now 
we ll go to australia  but first we got
a few things to do  it s time we got started 
  prudy  do you really wanna help 
  sure 
first  get joe outta here 
  then what 
  i got a couple of ideas 
if things work out right 
we might live through this thing 
i sure liked his idea about leaving 
prudy  you go in the courthouse 
do you know how to use this 
here  you ll need these 
  jake  are you there 
  yeah 
  you know what to do 
  oh  yeah 
keep out of the line of fire
whenever i can 
  mayor 
  can t talk  emergency council meeting 
  what s that all about 
  i m not gonna shoot through the window 
here  take care of these 
my eating teeth 
i don t wanna get them all shot up 
get joe 
  he ain t in there  pa 
  hold it  you re under arrest 
throw down your guns 
i ll accept your surrender 
take cover 
  haven t you heard of just wounding 
  i only know one way to shoot 
that s to kill 
we don t want a massacre on our hands 
so just watch it 
hold it  hold it  settle down out there 
just hold it 
ok  go ahead 
  jake  where d you put joe 
  upstairs 
go get him 
pa  look  your teeth 
  they saved my life 
  always worryin  about your life 
what am i supposed to jaw with
from now on 
pa  look 
i want all you people to unstrap your
gun belts and throw your rifles down 
or i m gonna have to set this thing off 
you don t think you re gonna bluff me
with that cannon 
why  it ain t even loaded 
  well  shall we see 
  believe him  pa 
you stay outta this 
you miserable coward 
what s it gonna be  danby 
jake  let joe loose 
  throw the rest of that bunch in jail 
  by myself 
i ll be right behind you 
you weren t gonna really
blow him up  were you 
of course not  that thing isn t loaded 
i just stuck that fake fuse in there 
see 
wow 
my business 
i ll find out who s responsible for this
outrage if it s the last thing i ever do 
disturbin  the peace  that s what it is 
i don t care if you are
cleanin  up this town 
that was a terrible thing to do
to them unfortunate girls 
i didn t know it was loaded 
i never done anything
to an unfortunate girl in my life 
some of those girls
are the closest friends i got 
well  well  who have we here 
it s the sheriff 
  it s the sheriff  boys 
  we know who it is 
everybody knows
who our sheriff is these days 
devery s right  you re the most popular
and respected citizen we ve got here 
that s nice to hear 
we re sendin  a delegation to washington
about turning this territory into a state 
  we d be proud if you d head it 
  no  no 
you want somebody who will be here 
now  jason  if you re upset with us
about that danby business   
  we were behind you all the way 
  it might not have looked that way 
no  that s not it  it s just that   
i ve never made any secret of the fact
that i m on my way to australia 
which reminds me  i m gonna have
to think about getting started again 
would you excuse me  gentlemen 
a small crisis needs to be handled 
jump  miss prudy  jump 
boys  i just want you to know
that from now on when you pick on
this lady  you ll be pickin  on my girl 
we didn t have any idea
the wind blew that way 
  now you know  spread the word around 
  yes  sir 
what do you mean  your girl 
prudy  for once in your life  play it smart
and keep your big mouth shut 
you keep out of this 
what do you mean  your girl 
come on  you ve had that look in your eye
since the first day i hit town 
we re gonna have an agreement  after
we re married  no matter how many kids 
when i say we re off to australia 
we pack up  kids and all  and off we go 
what do i wanna go to australia for 
that s where your husband would be 
girls usually go where their husbands are 
oh   
well  when you put it that way   
why don t you put me down 
i like it like this 
you want me to walk you home 
if you want to  sheriff 
say   
are you really one of the richest girls
in this part of the country 
  the richest 
  that s nice 
that s real nice 
the way this story ends
is that they get married
and he goes on to become
governor of the state 
he never gets to australia  but he keeps
