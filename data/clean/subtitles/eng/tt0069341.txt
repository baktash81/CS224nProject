about that old dump 
says he and his wife lived there
for their whole married life 
and now he wants to die there

hey  look  helen  look who s come back 
our littlejamie 
ah  that s wonderful  you re our only
friend now  you and the children 
we thought it might be neighborly
to let you know what was going on 
it s very kind of you to draw
our attention to this  mr  elliot 
it s so difficult to know what one s children
get up to when they re out of one s sight 
after all  last year i remember 
you can tell from looking at his house
what a filthy old man he is 
constantly filling it with children 
heaven knows what
his motivations are 
now don t forget what i said 
just stay away from him 
but  mummy 
he s such a nice old man 
don t argue with me 
you re not to see him again ever 
why don t you go and play
in our garden 
and don t take
any more sweets from him 
carrying rubbish all day 
his house must be filthy 
you and your mr  grimsdyke  now  remember 
i don t want you to go anywhere near him 
  oh  mum 
  and that s final 
i don t understand it 
everyone was so kind 
 sniffles 
now this  no work 
no children 
no one to make toys for 
well  never mind 
we ve always got each other 
haven t we  my dear 
mmm  that s all that matters 
just one more turn
of the screw   
and he ll sell his property
for next to nothing 
what s on your mind 
valentine s day 
  it s just two weeks away 
  so 
we ll send him valentines   
from everyone in town 
  oh 
  lots of mail for you today  mr  grimsdyke 
good morning 
thank you very much 
well  how very kind 
my dear  look 
it s not even christmas  is it 
not that it makes any difference
if it is or not 
who could be writing to us 
let s see here 
oh  it s a valentine card 
but you re my only sweetheart 
who can this be 
 noisy are children 
loud is a bell   
pungent is perfume 
but you only smell  
hmm 
 noisy are children  loud is a bell   
pungent is perfume 
but you only smell  
why  i don t think i like that 
let s see what we have here 
 a tree is beautiful
if its owner prunes it   
 but our town isn t   
 cause your presence ruins it  
oh 
 opening envelope 
 some people live in the country 
 some people live in the town 
 why don t you do us a service 
jump in the river and  
 dog howling 
 howling continues 
what s grimsdyke been
doing to that mongrel 
he hasn t stopped
whining for a week 
you know  come to think of it   
i haven t seen grimsdyke for days 
not since valentine s day 
he can t be far away
if the door s open 
this place is spotless 
i thought it d be filthy 
 creaking 
 man   but the merciful goodness
of the lord endureth forever and ever   
   whining 
   upon them that fear him   
 and his righteousness
upon his children s children 
 for as much as it hath pleased
almighty god ofhis great mercy   
to take unto himself
the soul of our dear brother  
arthur edward grimsdyke 
 here departed 
 we therefore commit
his body to the ground 
   earth to earth  ashes to ashes   
   dirt falling on coffin 
 dust to dust 
 in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life   
through our lord jesus christ  
it was kind of you
to pay for the burial 
it was the least i could do 
he was a neighbor 
what s that 
valentine s cards 
the ones left over
from last year when 
  must be a year ago 
  today 
it s valentine s day 
february the 14th 
ayear ago exactly

i didn t 
don t like grimsdyke 
what am i doing here 
 monk 
you ll see 
 door opens  closes 
well  that s it  ralph  i m afraid 
it s all gone 
  everything 
  more than everything  you have debts 
i did warn you  didn t i  not to use the money
that had been entrusted to you 
  the risks were far too great 
  the risks 
the gains could ve been enormous 
 sighs 
what do i do now 
well  you have two choices 
first  bankruptcy 
and according to you 
that would be dishonorable  wouldn t it 
oh  come on 
let s face it 
you ve done dishonorable things
in your life before  in your business life 
hard  ruthless 
oh  perhaps even cruel 
yes  to build up thejason empire 
sometimes i had to be 
  no one has to be 
  i did 
oh  it s easy to talk  but i had to fight
my way up the hard way 
if people got hurt 
they got hurt 
but i always paid my debts 
no  i m not going
into bankruptcy 
well  if you intend to try
and pay off your debts   
you ll have to start selling things 
things of value 
properties  your paintings 
everything 
my house  all the beautiful things
i ve acquired during the years 
it s the only way 
i won t do it 
i m afraid you ll have to 
so  there s nothing else for it 
we have to sell 
oh  i know it s a blow 
our whole life s in them 
everything we ve collected all over the world 
i remember that one 
we got it in that strange
shop in hong kong   
when you were selling guns to 
do you remember what the little man
in the shop said to us when he sold it to us 
yes   use it  
 use it wisely  
hmm  i wonder what
he meant by that 
ralph  have you 
have you ever seen this writing that s inscribed
on the bottom of this statuette 
  writing 
  hmm  yes  here at the base 
 three wishes i give
and no more   
 to each owner of me   
 so keep score 
 each wish will come true   
so take care what you do  
i can t read the rest 
but the last word is   
   deplore  
  what does it all mean 
 use it wisely  
if only it could give us three wishes 
that s storybook nonsense 
  but it reminds me of a tale
i once read  what was it 
  we could pay all our debts 
   the monkey s paw   that s what it was 
  i wish 
i read it when i was at school 
i wish for lots
and lots of money 
  oh  no  no 
  too late  i already have 
and i ve just remembered
what happened at the end of the story 
why  you said yourself 
it was just a story 
  like our three wishes 
   phone ringing 
hello  oh  hello  charles

   car engine starting

  hello 
   man on phone  is that mr  gregory 
  yes  yes  speaking 
  i m sorry to tell you  sir 
but your client  ralph jason   
has been killed in a car crash 
  in his car 
  yes  on the road about 10 miles from his home 
well  uh  have you told enid 
mrs  jason yet 
no  not yet 
we found some letters
from you in his pocket 
they indicate that you re not only his solicitor
but a close friend of the family 
we thought it better
that you break the news 
yes  yes  yes  of course 
leave it to me 
  i ll tell her 
  thank you  sir 
ralph  dead 
they found him in
the wreckage of his car 
he d obviously lost control 
skidded 
 sobbing 
enid  this may not be the best moment
to talk about this  but  uh   
it may alleviate
some of your other worries 
you realize this accident
makes you a rich woman 
rich 
ralph s insurance 
he always carried a large policy   
with a double indemnity
against accident 
oh  charles  i wished for lots and lots
of money  ralph warned me not to 
  no  that s a coincidence  surely 
  no  it s no coincidence 
that statuette 
it gave us three wishes 
i used one of them to wish
for lots and lots of money 
now i m going to wish
for ralph back 
charles 
do you know the story
of the monkey s paw  
that s the story of the old couple
who are given a monkey s paw   
which entitles them
to three wishes 
they wish for money 
and they get the money   
because their son is killed   
in a machine in his factory  crushed 
  enid  you mustn t wish ralph back 
  why not 
well  in the story  this mother wishes
her son back  and he does come back   
but in the condition in which he died 
mutilated  mangled  torn 
 enid 
i must be careful not to make the same mistake 
i shall wish that ralph were back
as he was before the accident 
i wish   
ralph were back exactly as he was   
immediately before the accident 
 pounding 
 pounding 
  open it  quickly 
  no  no  don t look 
his body was mangled
in the crash 
mangled 
it wasn t mangled 
mr  jason died of a heart attack
at the wheel 
 door closes 
i wished to bring him back as he was
immediately before the accident 
but he was already dead  dead from
a heart attack  so the accident didn t kill him 
  only one more wish 
  enid 
  please go away  leave me alone 
  please 
i want to be alone
with him  please 
only one more wish 
only one 
i mustn t waste it 
i must be careful 
oh  please  please   
i wish ralph were alive now 
i don t want him to die ever 
i want him moving 
breathing  talking  alive 
now  forever 
 screaming 
  ralph 
  oh  enid 
ralph  charles 
  help me 
  what s happened 
  oh 
   charles  what have you done 
i wished alive again  forever 
don t you realize he s been embalmed 
his veins are filled with embalming fluid   
  burning into him 
  oh  no 
 sobbing 
enid  do something 
 screaming continues 
for god s sake  enid

no  no  enid  don t 
  aah  aah

 men chattering 
 man coughs 
good morning 
my name is rogers 
major william rogers 
i ve been appointed your new superintendent
here  and take up my duties today 
i ve had considerable experience
in dealing with men as an officer in the army 
i promise you i will do this job
to the best of my ability 
i hope we ll all get along well 
if there are any complaints   
i shall be pleased to deal with them
in my office at any time 
  good morning 
   all mumbling  good morning

  shane

 wind whistling 
stone cold 
  it s always like that now 
   coughing 
 wheezing 
all right  old boy 
all right 
i ll get you an extra blanket 
   knocking 
  yes 
the men have asked me
to come and talk to you 
yes 
it s about the heating 
it s been very cold these past few nights 
we wondered if you 
for reasons of economy  the heating is now
turned off each evening at 2000 hours 
you should all be in bed by then 
after all  there s no point in staying up 
  you can t see anything 
  the beds are cold 
there aren t enough blankets 
i m trying to run this place
as efficiently and as economically as i can 
i m afraid the current budget
does not include the costs of new blankets 
do you know anything
about blind people 
no  i can t say i do 
until i took over this job 
but i was in the army for over 20 years 
and i learned to handle all kinds of men there 
with all due respect  sir 
we are not soldiers 
and blind people are not
like people with sight 
we have lost one sense   
but the loss of that one sense
only tends to sharpen the others 
do you know what that means 
we feel things more acutely 
if food is bad 
it tastes worse to us 
if a room is dirty 
we feel every speck 
if an insect scurries
across the floor  we hear it 
and if it s cold 
we feel the cold more 
why don t you sell that painting
and buy us fuel or extra blankets 
i was not aware that the administration
of expenditure for this establishment   
had been handed over to you 
mr  carter 
good morning

while we get nothing but slop 
i do the best i can for you within the limits
of the budget provided for me

what is all this 
i m on my way to a new job 
i don t know   
why i stopped here 
i do 
now you may go 
 scraping 
 thunder rumbling 
but how can we 
where are we 
in a place where people go
who have died without repentance 
you see 
i wasn t warning you   
but telling you why you are here   
for all eternity
