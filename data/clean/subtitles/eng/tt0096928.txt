the air is clean the waters clean
even the dirt is clean
bowling averages are way up
minigolf scores are way down
and we have more excellent waterslides
than any other planet
we communicate with
im telling you this place is great
but it almost wasnt
you see 700 years ago
the two great ones
ran into a few problems
so now i have to travel back in time
to help them out
if i fail to keep these two
on the correct path
the basis of our society will be in danger
dont worry itll all make sense
im a professional
im bill s preston esquire
and im ted hold on
bill here you take it
okay
and im ted theodore logan
yeah
and were wyld stallyns
smell it dude
lets bail
we blew it
guess we used too much power
i liked it
while i agree that in time
our band will be most triumphant
the truth is
wyld stallyns will never be a super band
until we have eddie van halen on guitar
yes but i do not believe
we will get eddie van halen
until we have a triumphant video
its pointless to have a triumphant video
before we even have decent instruments
how could we have decent instruments
if we dont know how to play
that is why we need eddie van halen
and that is why we need
a triumphant video
excellent
were late
for what
for school dude
yeah
bill im waiting
hes dead
what youre telling me essentially
is that napoleon
was a short dead dude

for your very hard work
who turned out the lights
hello san dimas
please welcome
for the final report of the afternoon
from all throughout history
some of the greatest people
who have ever lived
in their 1988 world tour
hows it going
im billy the kid
id like you all to put your hands together
now my good friends
bill s preston esquire
and ted theodore logan
thank you
hello san dimas high
mr ryan
fellow distinguished classmates
teachers babes
our first speaker was born in 470 bc
hi long time no see
a time when much of the world
looked like the cover of
the led zeppelin album houses of the holy
we were there there were many steps
and columns it was most tranquil
he is sometimes known
as the father of modern thought
he was the teacher of plato
who was in turn the teacher of aristotle
and like ozzy osbourne was repeatedly
accused of corruption of the young
and since he doesnt speak english
my friend ted here
is gonna interpret for him
so please welcome
to tell us what he thinks of san dimas
the most bodacious
philosophizer in ancient greece
socrates
totally out of control
ive got a good idea where he gets it
if you and your wife used a little discipline
your son wouldnt be such a bad influence
is discipline your key to success with ted
yes it is hes going to
an alaskan military school
loves you best
in all the world
what are they doing up there
he also loves baseball
therefore teds fathers
own fear of failure
has caused him
to make his son the embodiment
of all of his own deepest anxieties
about himself
and hence
his aggression transference onto ted
okay
yes
thank you very much sigmund freud
no just got a minor oedipal complex
it is indeed a pleasure
to introduce to you
a gentleman we picked up
in medieval mongolia
in the year 1269
please welcome
the very excellent barbarian
mr genghis khan
this is a dude who 700 years ago
totally ravaged china
and who we are told two hours ago
totally ravaged
oshmans sporting goods
a most bodacious soldier and general
miss of arc totally rousted
the english from france
and then she turned this dude
dauphin into a king
and all this by the time she was 17
je vais remporter un triomphe terrible
en russie
avec mes waterslides
the music of ludwig von beethoven
as you can see
genghis very much enjoys twinkies
because of the excellent sugar rush
he also loves billiards
beethovens favorite works include
mozarts requiem
handels messiah
and bon jovis slippery when wet
to improve on the condition of her armies
joan of arc plans on instituting
a fullscale aerobics program
on her return to france
i dont think its going to work
triomphe napoléon
he loves
he loves san dimas
and now for our last speaker
one of the greatest presidents
in american history
mr abraham lincoln
fourscore and
seven minutes ago
we your forefathers
were brought forth upon
a most excellent adventure
conceived by our new friends
bill
and ted
these two great gentlemen
are dedicated to a proposition
which was true in my time
just as its true today
be excellent to each other
and
party on dudes
no way
thank you san dimas high
we want more
intro
im bill s preston esquire
whats up ted
we traveled through time
i mean we met lots of great leaders
and we got an a plus on our history report

learning how to play
maybe youre right
hello again my excellent friends
congratulations on
passing your history report
rufus the babes

the foundation of our whole society
no way
yes way

that futuristic place with the domes
and the totally excellent music
they totally worshipped us there
i know
thats why i was sent to make sure
you passed your history report
if you guys were separated it would have
been disastrous for life as we know it
you see eventually your music
will help to end war and poverty
it will align the planets
and bring them into universal harmony
allowing meaningful contact
with all forms of life
from extraterrestrial beings
to common household pets
and
its excellent for dancing
why dont you have the ladies sign as well
