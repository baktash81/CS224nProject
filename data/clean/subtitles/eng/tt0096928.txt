the air is clean  the water s clean 
even the dirt is clean 
bowling averages are way up 
mini golf scores are way down 
and we have more excellent waterslides   
   than any other planet
we communicate with 
i m telling you  this place is great   
   but it almost wasn t 
you see  700 years ago 
the two great ones   
   ran into a few problems 
so now i have to travel back in time
to help them out 
if i fail to keep these two
on the correct path   
    the basis of our society will be in danger 
don t worry  it ll all make sense 
i m a professional 
i m bill s  preston  esquire 
and i m ted    hold on 
bill  here  you take it 
okay 
  and i m ted  theodore  logan 
  yeah 
and we re wyld stallyns 
  smell it  dude 
  let s bail 
we blew it 
guess we used too much power 
i liked it 
while i agree that  in time 
our band will be most triumphant   
   the truth is 
wyld stallyns will never be a super band   
   until we have eddie van halen on guitar 
yes  but i do not believe
we will get eddie van halen   
   until we have a triumphant video 
it s pointless to have a triumphant video   
   before we even have decent instruments 
how could we have decent instruments
if we don t know how to play 
that is why we need eddie van halen 
and that is why we need
a triumphant video 
excellent 
  we re late 
  for what 
  for school  dude 
  yeah 
bill  i m waiting 
he s dead 
what you re telling me  essentially 
is that napoleon

to great leaders such as   
   genghis khan  joan of arc   
   and socratic method   
   the world is full of history 
it seems to me the only thing
you ve learned is that caesar   
   is a  salad dressing dude  
bill  ted  this is really quite simple 
you have flunked
every section of this class 
now  unless you get an a plus
on your final oral report tomorrow

you at least cover those areas   
   if you want to pass the course 
  understand 
  yes  sir 
okay 
your report
had better be something very special

listen to this 
 express to the class

today  leaders are impeached
rather than beheaded 
still  while in her day  marie antoinette
said   let them eat cake

 let them eat fast food

    with the world of san dimas

down the hall  to the left  quiet 
and i m sure i speak
for mr  ward and mrs  rowe   
   when i say that your reports
were very entertaining   
   and very informative for all of us 
it seems we may be
one report short today   
   so we ll leave just a bit early 
but once again  i want to thank you all
for your very hard work 
who turned out the lights 
hello  san dimas 
please welcome 
for the final report of the afternoon   
    from all throughout history   
    some of the greatest people
who have ever lived   
    in their 1988 world tour 
how s it going 
i m billy the kid 
i d like you all to put your hands together 
now  my good friends   
   bill s  preston  esquire   
   and ted  theodore  logan 
thank you 
hello  san dimas high 
mr  ryan 
fellow distinguished classmates   
   teachers  babes 
  our first speaker was born in 470 b c 
  hi  long time no see 
a time when much of the world   
   looked like the cover of
the led zeppelin album houses of the holy 
we were there  there were many steps
and columns  it was most tranquil 
he is sometimes known
as the father of modern thought 
he was the teacher of plato 
who was in turn the teacher of aristotle 
and like ozzy osbourne  was repeatedly
accused of corruption of the young 
and since he doesn t speak english   
   my friend ted  here 
is gonna interpret for him 
so please welcome 
to tell us what he thinks of san dimas   
   the most bodacious
philosophizer in ancient greece   
   socrates 
   totally out of control 
i ve got a good idea where he gets it 
if you and your wife used a little discipline 
your son wouldn t be such a bad influence 
is discipline your key to success with ted 
yes  it is  he s going to
an alaskan military school 
   loves you best   
   in all the world 
what are they doing up there 
he also loves baseball 
therefore  ted s father s
own fear of failure   
   has caused him
to make his son the embodiment   
   of all of his own deepest anxieties
about himself 
and hence 
his aggression transference onto ted 
okay 
yes 
thank you very much  sigmund freud 
no  just got a minor oedipal complex 
it is indeed a pleasure
to introduce to you   
   a gentleman we picked up
in medieval mongolia   
   in the year 1269 
please welcome 
the very excellent barbarian   
   mr  genghis khan 
this is a dude who  700 years ago   
   totally ravaged china 
and who  we are told  two hours ago   
   totally ravaged
oshman s sporting goods 
a most bodacious soldier and general   
   miss of arc totally rousted
the english from france 
and then she turned this dude 
dauphin  into a king 
and all this by the time she was 17 
je vais remporter un triomphe terrible   
    en russie   
    avec mes waterslides 
the music of ludwig von beethoven 
as you can see 
genghis very much enjoys twinkies   
   because of the excellent sugar rush 
he also loves billiards 
beethoven s favorite works include
mozart s requiem   
    handel s messiah 
and bon jovi s slippery when wet 
to improve on the condition of her armies 
joan of arc plans on instituting   
   a full scale aerobics program
on her return to france 
i don t think it s going to work 
triomphe  napoléon 
he loves   
he loves san dimas 
and now  for our last speaker 
one of the greatest presidents
in american history   
   mr  abraham lincoln 
fourscore and   
   seven minutes ago   
   we  your forefathers   
   were brought forth upon
a most excellent adventure   
   conceived by our new friends   
   bill   
   and ted 
these two great gentlemen   
   are dedicated to a proposition   
   which was true in my time   
   just as it s true today 
be excellent to each other 
and   
   party on  dudes 
no way
