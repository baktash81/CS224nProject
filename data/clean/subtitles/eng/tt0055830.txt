  that s right 
well  mary  you ll make
a fine organist for that church 
be very satisfying to you  i think 
it s just a job to me 
well  that s not quite the attitude
for going into church work 
i m not taking the vows 
i m only going to play the organ 
oh  you want more than that 
of course it doesn t pay much 
but  well  at least it s a start 
are you driving by benton
to see your folks 
no  i can t  i    i must hurry 
i    i ve got to leave 
i m going to drive straight through 
mary  it takes more than intellect
to be a musician 
put your soul into it a little  okay 
good luck  mary

 bell dings 
can i help you 
  fill it up 
  all right 
be anything else  lady 
could you tell me what that big structure
is back a few miles by the lake 
oh  you mean the old bathhouse 
 chuckles  yeah  that used to be
a pretty ritzy place in the old days 
then the lake went down
and they made a dance hall out of it 
then they put those buildings up out there
and made some sort of
a carnival there for a while 
ah  that s years ago though 
just stands out there now 
i see 
uh  i have an address here of
a rooming house  could you direct me 
oh  sure  why  that s just
right over here a little way 
been savin  it for you
since i got your letter 
could ve rented it yesterday
if i d wanted 
oh  it    it s fine 
i it s just about what i expected 
i knew you d like it 
this ain t no regular
roomin  house  you know 
i only got you
and mr  linden across the hall 
each room s got its own
private bathroom too 
you can take all the baths you want 
i m not one to fuss
about things like that 
thank you 
i think i ll be quite comfortable 
well  hope you ll stay a while 
i m downstairs
in the back part of the house 
so if there s anything else you need 
guess it ll have to wait till morning 
night 
good night  mrs  thomas 
    eerie organ 
and this  miss henry 
is our pride and joy 
this was made in the same town
where i ve been studying 
of course 
that s where we heard about you 
you have found a place to stay 
  yes  i have a room 
  good 
well  we hope
you re going to like it here 
we re not the largest church
in this area  of course 
but we have a nice congregation 
we ll have to have some sort of reception 
they ll want to meet you 
  couldn t we just skip that 
  skip that 
i don t suppose
it s an absolute necessity 
i don t know what
some of the ladies will say 
if they say i m a fine organist 
that should be enough  shouldn t it 
well  yes  of course 
we ll let it go at that
for the time being 
but  my dear 
you cannot live in isolation
from the human race  you know 
  mind if i try this now 
  i want you to 
    organ  sacred 
you go right ahead 
i ll be next door at the manse 
if you need me 
    continues 
we have an organist
capable of stirring the soul 
    eerie 
    stops 
what do you see 
oh  nothing  nothing at all 
i ve practiced all afternoon
and it s gotten me in a mood 
you need some fresh air 
i ve got to make a call out past the lake 
would you like to come along for the ride 
  you know that old pavilion out there 
  mm hmm 
  will we pass it 
  go right by it 
  stop and look at it if you like 
  i would  with you along 
good 
 no audible dialogue 
    eerie organ 
this used to be quite a place 
  it s been deserted for a long time now 
  will you take me in 
goodness no 
it isn t safe out there anymore 
that s why they put up this barrier 
be very easy to step around it 
what attraction could
there be for you out there 
i m not sure 
i m a reasonable person  i don t know 
maybe i want to satisfy myself
that the place is nothing more
than it appears to be 
  would you take me out there 
  no 
the law has placed it off limits 
wouldn t be very seemly for
a minister to break the law  would it 
no  maybe i can come back some other time 
shall we go along now 
    eerie organ 
ah  i thought that d be you 
good evening 
that organ playin  must take a long time 
you ve been gone most the whole day 
i went for a long drive in the country
with my new boss  an elderly minister 
oh  ho 
that must have been a kick in the head 
i learned that
from my other boarder  mr  linden 
did you get your supper 
oh  i forgot 
well  this ain t no boardinghouse 
but i got some coffee
and sandwich makings left 
i could bring you some up after a while 
good  i ll be taking one of those baths
you re so generous with 
take as many as you want 
i ain t one to make a fuss
about a thing like that 
 knocking on door 
 water off 
come in  mrs  thomas 
oh  uh  just a minute 
 gasps 
i thought you were mrs  thomas 
yeah  i  uh   
i wondered when you asked me in 
i m john linden 
i m your neighbor across the hall 
  nice to meet you  would you excuse   
  hey  i  uh   
  i was just wondering   
  just stand right there 
i forgot to introduce myself 
i m mary henry 
yeah  i know 
i  uh    i heard you tell mrs  thomas
you haven t ate anything yet  huh 
i just thought  bein  neighborly and all   
i haven t eaten anything either 
i just thought i d ask you out to dinner 
that s very thoughtful 
but i can t accept 
i know we haven t met or anything yet 
but i just thought   
i m sorry  you ll have to excuse me 
look  there s a real nice restaurant
right down the street  and i thought   
i m the kind of guy
who doesn t like to eat by himself 
i ve made arrangements
to eat in my room tonight 
hey  if  uh  you change your mind 
just holler 
looks kind of lonesome in here 
good night  mr  linden

mrs  thomas  miss henry

hmm

the   
oh  you must mean mr  linden 
he has the room across the hall 
no  i mean the other one 
there is no other 
me and you and mr  linden   chuckles 
us three is all there is in this house 
b but you must have passed him out there 
you re needin  this food 
goin  without eatin 
makes you jumpy sometimes 
maybe you heard
the boards pop or somethin  
these old houses
creak worse than my knees 
i didn t hear him  mrs  thomas  i saw him 
now  don t talk that way 
i don t sleep so good as it is 
it s these old houses  they   
they re big enough so that
you could hide a man in every corner 
you just gotta not let
your imagination run away with you 
  are you going out there 
  well  of course 
there s nobody there 
now you just go
and eat that sandwich i made for you 
don t drink the coffee
if coffee keeps you awake 
it won t 
coffee never keeps me awake 
    eerie organ 
 wind blowing  rain pattering 
 thunder rumbling 
 thunder rumbling 
 alarm ringing 
 stops 
well  good morning 
i heard your alarm  i knew you d be up 
  guess what i got 
   chuckling  i can t imagine 
oh  just what it takes
to start the day off right 
i make it in my room 
it saves me havin  to get dressed up 
i guess i had to get dressed
to come over here anyway 
oh  it looks just like what i need 
well  then two cups of coffee comin  up 
say  uh 
i guess you took it wrong last night
about me comin  to your door and all 
i m not a very sociable person ordinarily 
how can i resist an inducement like this 
a what 
come on  i don t know all those big words 
i m just an ordinary guy
who works in a warehouse  that s all 
i make pretty good money though 
   snaps fingers 
  hey 
i got a couple of shots left over from
last night  want a little bit in yours 
no  thanks  it s not the recommended
breakfast for a church organist 
oh  is that what you do 
you mean they pay somebody
to play the organ in church 
some churches do 
hey  i hope you don t mind about this 
i just didn t know
you were a church woman 
to me a church is just
a place of business 
  well  that s a funny way to look at it 
  why 
people seem shocked because
i took a job in a church 
and i regard it simply as a job 
i m a professional organist
and i play for pay  that s all 
 scoffs  thinkin  like that 
don t that give you nightmares 
strange you should say that 
as a matter of fact   
not for that reason  mind you   
but i had
the strangest feeling last night 
yeah  i had kind of a lost night myself 
that s funny 
the world is so different in the daylight 
but in the dark 
your fantasies get so out of hand 
but in the daylight 
everything falls back into place again 
let s have no more nights 
or let s make them more interesting  huh 
say  how d you get to be
a church organist 
i studied it in college 
i could ve gone to college 
i used to play pretty good football 
but they wanted me
to take a lot of classes and things 
  they re that way 
  i m just as smart as the next guy 
but i just didn t dig
what they were teachin  in school 
and the thing i hated most
was  principal products  
principal products 
you know  like  uh 
 the principal products of brazil are    
oh  geez 
coffee beans  snake oil 
you know  like that 
 scoffs  when i was in school 
i couldn t care less 
the only thing i cared about was girls 
didn t they offer a course in that 
 chuckles  if they would ve done that 
i would ve graduated 
 liquid pouring 
what s the matter 
can you still taste the coffee 
 chuckles  come on 
what do you think  i m an alcoholic 
i just like to start the day off
in a good mood  that s all 
you must be hilarious by noon 
i m just the kind of a guy employers want 
you know  the happy worker 
come on 
didn t i make your morning happier 
this morning you re exactly what i needed 
you re gonna need me in the evenin  too 
you just don t know it yet 
i ll rinse off these cups 
ah  no  no 
just spoils the flavor for tomorrow 
well  thank you for the coffee 
it was unsanitary  but delicious 
well  uh  should ve put some of
the germ killer inside 
well  i hate to leave so early 
think you can get through the door 
you got the wrong impression of me 
well  i meant because
you have so many things to carry 
oh  like i said  i hate to leave 
it s been a pleasure  mr  linden 
but i m sure you have to get to work 
  don t you 
  nope 
  i have the whole day free for shopping 
   chuckles 
   salesclerk bell dings 
  does the hem hang right in back 
we might change the hemline a little 
the drape is just fine 
otherwise it looks very nice 
i m sure it isn t very chic to take
the second dress  but i like it 
we alter it a little here
to make it straight all the way around 
do you want to go back
to your dressing room 
 bell dinging 
 bell dinging 
    eerie organ 
    continues 
i like it fine  i believe i ll have you
deliver the dress  if you don t mind 
i did say i d take it 
 no audible dialogue 
 no audible dialogue 
what s the matter with her 
what s the matter with everyone 
why don t they answer me 
    continues 
 no ambient noise

 ambient noise resumes 
 bird twittering 
 gasps 
   gasps 
  what is it 
that man 
i didn t mean any harm 
i just stopped to get a drink 
no  no 
it was that man 
that man 
there was someone else there 
that strange man was there 
now  look  you ve had a fright 
hysteria won t solve anything 
now control yourself 
look  i m dr  samuels 
my office is right across
the street there 
you ve had a shock 
if you would like my assistance 
i ll be glad to offer it 
thank you 
  could i come with you now 
  certainly 
i ll take her over to my office 
we ll see that she s all right 
my purse 
it was more than just
not being able to hear anything 
or make contact with anyone 
it was as though   
as though for a time i didn t exist 
as though i had no place in the world 
no part of the life around me 
dr  samuels 
and then you saw this    this man 
mary  yes 
you ll excuse my back  but i wanted
to get some of that written down 
i must have been talking for an hour 
anything else 
anything you haven t told me 
that s all there is 
that s the whole story 
he s been following me 
that s all there is to it 
it isn t that simple though  is it 
what do you mean 
he couldn t have been
in the park this afternoon 
or one of us men would ve seen him 
and that night in the hallway 
you said yourself the landlady came up
a minute later  and she didn t see him 
what are you driving at 
it s been less than a week since you
were in a car that crashed into the river 
how you got out of that
no one seems to know 
but that experience must have been
a serious emotional shock 
you think i imagined all of it  don t you 
you think i m insane 
i didn t say that  i don t mean that 
i m a competent person 
if anything  i m a realist 
i m not given to imagining anything 
hogwash 
all of us imagine things 
have you ever heard two men
talking behind your back
and imagined they were talking about you 
have you never imagined
you saw someone you knew 
and walked up to them and found
they were a perfect stranger 
  i don t see what this has to do with it 
  the point is this 
our imaginations play tricks on us 
they often misinterpret
what we see and hear  do you agree 
i suppose so 
if that can happen in ordinary times 
go a step further 
look what can happen in a high fever 
or following a serious emotional shock 
it doesn t seem possible
that i could have imagined all of it 
does this man  this figure 
resemble anyone you ve ever known 
  an acquaintance  or your father 
  no 
  have a boyfriend here or back home 
  no  no desire for one 
  never 
  no 
i m surprised to find myself
saying that  but it s true 
i have no desire for
the close company of other people 
have you always felt this way 
i    i don t know 
don t you want to join
in the things that other people do 
share the experiences of other people 
i don t seem capable
of being very close to people 
i do feel that perhaps i m trying
to reach out for those other things 
do you feel guilty wanting them 
i don t understand you 
i m not a psychiatrist  and perhaps
i m being clumsy at all this 
but i am suggesting that perhaps
this figure represents a guilt feeling 
oh  that s ridiculous 
maybe  frankly  i don t know 
well  i know one thing 
if my imagination is playing tricks on me 
i m going to put a stop to it 
you re a very strong willed person 
aren t you 
i survive  if that s what you mean 
that old pavilion out by the lake 
somehow you associate it
with all this  don t you 
i could go out there 
i could put an end to that too 
  i could go out there   
  now don t be hasty 
if it is all in my imagination 
i could put a stop to it 
maybe  but at least someone
should be with you  i can t possibly   
as you say  doctor 
i m a person of strong will 
and the time to go out there is now 
and if i have to  i can go alone 
    eerie organ 
    continues 
 clattering 
    stops 
 wind blowing

say  uh 
i don t wanna get turned down again 
i was thinkin 
of askin  you out to dinner 
i stopped for a bite to eat on the way 
anyway  i have to practice
at the church this evening 
look  uh  how s about if
i pick you up afterward 
we ll go someplace and dance or somethin  
i m sorry  i m not much for dancing 
uh  hey  uh 
you mind if i ask you a question 
i won t know until i hear it 
what  are you afraid of men 
no  i m not afraid of men 
well  you seem sort of cold 
this morning when i brought you
the coffee  you were friendly 
this morning i needed company 
well  maybe you ll need company tonight 
it s better than walkin  home alone 
yes  it is 
i should be finished around 9 00 
  will that be all right 
  that s okay by me 
say  uh  i ll see you in church  huh 
    organ  sacred 
    eerie 
    continues 
profane  sacrilege 
what are you playing in this church 
have you no respect 
do you feel no reverence 
then i feel sorry for you
and your lack of soul 
this organ  the music of this church 
these things have meaning
and significance to us 
i assumed they did to you 
but without this awareness 
i m afraid you cannot be our organist 
in conscience  i must ask you to resign 
that does not mean
that i am abandoning you 
nor should you turn
your back on the church 
there is help here 
and i urge you to accept it 
well  hi there  i ve been waitin 
an awful long time for you 
my car s over there
