mass production does it 
to be honest 
you re not clean either 
i m not that neat maybe

i think that more people
are neat than are clean 
in my personal thing  i don t see that 
i m seeing more filth  a lot of filth 
what they need to do every day
is a cockroach thing   
   where they spray the homes   
can you imagine if their doors were
a pretty colour  with a pot outside 
 could be adorable 
 and they picked up 
it wouldn t be filthy
without coke bottles and whiskey   
   and those signs everywhere 
they should be erased 
all those signs
selling you crap and more crap 
i don t know  i don t know 
i don t even want to talk about it 
it s just filthy  people are filthy 
that s the biggest thing
that s wrong with people 
i think if they were clean
they wouldn t have anybody to pick on 
dirt 
not dirt  see  dirt isn t bad 
it s filth  filth is bad 
that s what starts maggots and riots 
follow that truck 
they know the best places to stop

 remember  mother used to say    bobby    
 ex cuse me 
 go ahead 
 ex cuse me 
i was going to ask robert how long
it had been since he d been away 
three years 
no  it s more like two years  isn t it 
it s been more than that 
tita  you have no sense of timing
away f rom the piano  dear 
i don t think that s true 
it s true 
what have you been doing 
odd jobs  i work here and there 
nothing too interesting 
you no longer play at all 
before my misfortune   
i m not sure
you re aware of my accident 
tita was telling me about it 
it s difficult   
   for me to turn my neck 
this way especially 
if i look at catherine   
   i shift the whole base
of my body around this way 
i was real sorry to hear about it  carl 
i said  i was real sorry
to hear about it 
anyways   
catherine  what was i saying 
yes  just after i d come off tour
with the betenthaller quartet 
father  herbert and i
had a summit conference 
a summit conference 
where was i 
polishing silver behind the coal bin 
well  i don t know where you were 
penis envy 
i hope i didn t hear that 
they wanted a detective to ferret
you out  and i talked them out of it 
whatever you were doing 
you had a right to do   
   no matter how nonsensical your
ventures may be  it was that simple 
i really appreciate it  carl 
i don t think you ought to imply
that daddy was wrong in f ront of daddy 
don t force him that way 
how long have you been here 
only two months 
well  satiety is my father and mother 
carl 
if you re finished 
i think i d like to go do some work 
certainly  dear 
ex cuse me  see you later 
i hope you feel right at home 
i feel fine 
he has ways of communicating  robert 
i can tell when he s expressing approval
or disapproval  just f rom his eyes 
yeah 
some range 
i can t take much more of seeing him
sitting there like a stone 
it s not that bad 
yes  it is 
will you stay a while 
i don t know 
breathe 
all right 
now once more  once more   
hello 
hi  i ve been
looking all over for you 
you have  i went riding 
riding 
that s dangerous  you know 
riding 
play the piano all day and then
jump on a horse  you can get cramps 
well  i like to ride 
rain or shine  i do it any chance
i can get  it s very invigorating 
 ls it 
 yes 
well  i don t like to get
too invigorated  myself 
you don t 
what else do you do 
well  there s fishing  boating 
there s concerts on the mainland 
i feel silly telling you this 
this is your home 
you know what there is to do 
nothing 
nothing 
nothing 
it must be very boring for you here 
that s right 
i find that hard to comprehend 
i don t think i ve ever been bored 
ex cuse me 
what re you doing right now 
right now  i plan to take a hot tub
and soak myself 
then after that 
after that   
   i plan to read some music
and rest for a while 
tomorrow  then 
tomorrow 
tomorrow s a f ull practice day 
but the day after tomorrow
i will be f ree 
carl has hydrotherapy on tuesdays 
the day after tomorrow 
will you be f ree 
yeah  i ll probably be f ree 
one thing i find   
   very difficult to imagine   
   is that one could have this
incredible background in music   
   and walk away f rom it
without a second thought 
i gave it a second thought 
i mean  how could you no longer play
at all  i think that s very strange 
i played a little bit here and there 
as a matter of fact 
once i was a rehearsal pianist 
for ballet  an opera 
las vegas musical revue 
 you don t call that music 
 oh  yes  i do 
it s music  you know 
bring on the girls
i m singing you a song
are you feeling better 
i feel great

catherine  your game 
catherine 
will you 
that was beautif ul  i m surprised 
thank you 
i was really very moved  but   
what s wrong 
nothing  it s just i picked the easiest
piece that i could think of   
   and i first played it when i was 8
years old  and i played it better then 
can t you understand it was the feeling
i was affected by 
i didn t have any 
you had no inner feeling 
none 
well  then  i must
have been supplying it 
maybe if you supply a little more 
it might rub off on me  who knows 
i doubt it 
i could get interested 
well  i couldn t 
what does it have to be with you 
grim and serious 
look  you played 
i honestly responded 
and you made me feel embarrassed
for having responded to you 
it wasn t necessary 
yeah  it was  i faked a little chopin 
you faked a big response 
i don t think that s accurate 
all i ve been getting f rom you is
meaningf ul looks at the dinner table   
   and vague suggestions about the day   
i am not conscious
of having given you any looks 
as for the day after tomorrow 
this is the day after tomorrow 
and i am  unfortunately  seeing you 
if you ll ex cuse me 
i d like to take a bath 
 what do you want anyway 
 some bath oil 
some bath oil 
how about some avocado  or this 
or some of this jasmine 
how about this 
what are you doing 
what are you doing screwing around
with all this crap 
i do not find your language
very charming 
it isn t  it s direct 
i d like you to leave   
   so that i can take a bath 
is that direct 
serious 
is that what s important to you 
serious 
yes 
let s be serious  sit down 
 don t do that 
 shut up 
no inner feeling 
i told him the truth  finally 
he was my husband
and i loved him very much 
but  it wasn t working any better
the second time than it did the first 
he was a cellist 
and there was i   
   no longer 17  looking up at him 
and i said to him 
 joseph  you re f ull of beans  
and i left him 
is that what you said to him 
something like that 
as a matter of fact  joseph introduced
me to carl right around then 
how are you 
incredible 
carl restored me  he really did 
he s much more substantial
than you give him credit for being 
do you think you could discreetly
move across the hall now 
yes  i think i could discreetly
move across the hall now 
robert 
i have some f ree time tomorrow morning
before carl gets back  if you d like 
of course i d like it 
bananas  bananas 
you certainly do have a beautif ul piece
of real estate out here  mr  dupea 
can he hear me 
he s not hard of hearing 
that s a blessing at least 
this certainly is an improvement
on the motel and the coffee shop 
how could you ever leave
such a beautif ul place 
i don t know 
you ve been staying
in a motel all this time 
for two weeks there wasn t hardly
nobody there to talk to  but me 
but why did you stay at the motel 
there s plenty of room here 
well  i was going to   
   but bobby had to come up here
and feel it up here first 
but then it took so long 
i run flat out of money 
you didn t leave me
any number or anything  honey 
and i had to  you know 
get in a taxi and come on out here   
   in the hopes that i would not
be intruding myself 
no  not at all 
you re perfectly welcome to stay here 
well  thank you 
that s a very nice thing for you to say 
not at all 
you have a beautif ul head of hair 
thank you 
is it natural 
 rayette 
 what 
just finish eating 
am i holding up dessert 
no  not at all 
take all the time you want 
i do eat slow as a bird   
   whereas bobby can pack it away
like a speed swing 
is there any ketchup around 
for god s sake 
please  let s not be rude 
that s okay 
he didn t mean anything by that 
i don t  huh 
bobby s just about the moodiest man
i ve ever been with 
are you all right 
where are you going 
to pick up some f riends
of carl s and mine 
i wanna talk to you 
i ll be back later 
i wanna talk right now 
i wanna explain   
 no  it isn t necessary 
 yes  it is 
come on  move it 
will you shut up 
come on 
this is impossible  i have to go 
will you just wait one minute 
i haven t been being fair to carl 
i have to tell you that 
what  i can t hear you 
i m sorry everything s
been so conf using 
i ll see you later this evening 
you see  man is born into the world with
his existent adversary f rom the first 
it is his historic  mythic inheritance 
is this startling 
aggression is prehistoric 
an organism behaves
according to its nature   
   which derives f rom the circumstances
of its inheritance 
fact remains that primitive man took
delight in tearing his adversary apart 
that is where  i think 
the core of the problem resides 
doesn t that seem apocalyptic 
i do not make poetry 
is there a tv in the house 
i remarked to john   
   that rationality is not
a device to alter facts 
i think of it
as an extraneous tool  a gadget   
   somewhat like the television 
to look at it any other way
is ridiculous 
there s some good things on it 
i beg your pardon 
the tv  there s some
good things on it sometimes 
i have strong doubts 
nevertheless  i am not discussing media 
but there is always hope 
 for the few 
 what about love 
what about it 
wouldn t you say that more ill has been
done f rom love than f rom abomination 
no  no  i wouldn t 
well  you are a romantic  catherine 
and once more about to be married 
so you can be ex cused   
   f rom objective discussions 
but ask carl 
ask him if even the institution
of marriage is completely f ree f rom it 
ask him 
i think these cold 
objective discussions are aggressive 
ex cuse me 
that s reactive 
if i may say  without dampening
the spirit of your adventure   
you haven t dampened my spirit 
 ex cuse me 
 i should hope not 
but it s still open to some dispute that
there seems to be less aggression   
   or violence  if you like   
i m sorry  i don t speak french 
   and loftier natures   
what kind of doggy is this 
this is a border collie 
i had a pussycat once 
it was a little fluffy thing 
bobby gave it to me  remember  bobby 
the little pussycat you gave me 
yeah 
had two little white f ront paws 
and i was crazy after her 
we left it at some f riends  house   
   and she got squashed flat
as a tortilla outside their mobile home 
there  do you see what i mean 
the choice of words juxtaposed
with the image of a fluffy kitten 
the enchantment of words 
 squashed     flat    etcetera   
well  she was 
perhaps  but it was just
what i was trying to point out 
don t sit there pointing at her 
i beg your pardon 
i said  don t point at her  you creep 
but i was just   
where do you get the ass to tell anybody
about class or what she typifies 
you shouldn t even be
in the same room with her 
this is really too much 
 just calm down 
 you re f ull of shit 
you re all f ull of shit 
catherine 
catherine 
i can t talk to you 
leave me alone 
what the hell s going on 
 what re you doing 
 what s   
hey  where   
where s catherine 
i don t know where catherine is 
i m talking to you  tita 
i told you just to take
your hands off my sister  nurse 
move out 
stop it 
stop it  stop it 
hold it  will you 
hold it  take it easy 
take it easy  will you 
stop it  let him go 
you give up 
do you give up  do you 
stop it  stop it  stop it 
 give up 
 stop 
give up  give up  give up 
bobby 
i just wanted to talk to you 
it s useless 
look  give me a chance 
i m trying to be delicate with you   
   but you just won t understand 
i couldn t go with you  not because
of carl  but because of you 
you re a strange person  robert 
i mean  what would it come to 
a person who has no love for himself 
no respect for himself   
   no love of his f riends 
family  work  something 
how can he ask for love in return 
why should he ask for it 
living here in this rest home asylum 
that s what you want 
yes 
that ll make you happy 
i hope it will  yes 
i m sorry 
okay 
are you cold 
i don t know if you d be   
   particularly interested
in hearing anything about me 
my life  i mean 
most of it doesn t add up to much   
   that i could relate as a way
of life that you d approve of 
i move around a lot 
not because i m looking
for anything  really   
   but because i m getting away
f rom things that get bad   
   if i stay 
auspicious beginnings 
you know what i mean 
i m trying to imagine you re   
   you re half of this conversation 
my feeling is  i don t know   
   that if you could talk 
we wouldn t be talking 
it s pretty much the way
that it got to be before i left 
are you all right 
i don t know what to say 
tita suggested that we try to   
i don t know 
i think that she feels   
i think that she feels that we ve got   
   some understanding to reach 
she totally denies the fact   
   that we were never that comfortable
with one another to begin with 
the best that i can do is apologize 
we both know that i was never
really that good at it anyway 
i m sorry it didn t work out 
bobby 
you re leaving 
yeah  i said a week 
i think i overstayed myself 
you were going without
saying goodbye to me 
i didn t want to say goodbye to anyone 
but what about me 
i ll say goodbye to you  tita 
oh  robert 
watch the birdie 
bye 
come on  ray 
i want to take a picture
of us in f ront of the place 
not now  ray 
listen  i never got to
thank you all for your hospitality 
tell carl if any of you wanna come to
our place  you ll be more than welcome 
bye  now 
your kiss is like a drink
when i am thirsty
oh  and i m thirsty for you
with all my heart
but don t love me then pretend
as though we ve never kissed
don t touch me
don t touch me
cut it out 
son of a bitch  bobby 
you quit pushing me away like that 
i ve had enough of that
to last me an entire lifetime 
why don t you just
be good to me for a change 
there isn t anybody gonna look
after you and love you as good as i do 
did you hear me 
baby 
i m going to that café for some coffee 
you want anything 
no 
you got any change 
you don t have any change 
sure you don t want anything 
fill it up  will you 
hey  wait 
don t you got a jacket
or anything with you 
no 
jesus 
got burned up 
everything in the car
got the shit burned out of it 
everything 
all i got is what i got on 
i got one behind the seat
if you want it 
no  it s okay 
suit yourself 
tell you one thing 
where we re going
it s gonna get colder than hell
