youre aware of my accident
tita was telling me about it
its difficult
for me to turn my neck
this way especially
if i look at catherine
i shift the whole base
of my body around this way
i was real sorry to hear about it carl
i said i was real sorry
to hear about it
anyways
catherine what was i saying
yes just after id come off tour
with the betenthaller quartet
father herbert and i
had a summit conference
a summit conference
where was i
polishing silver behind the coal bin
well i dont know where you were
penis envy
i hope i didnt hear that
they wanted a detective to ferret
you out and i talked them out of it
whatever you were doing
you had a right to do
no matter how nonsensical your
ventures may be it was that simple
i really appreciate it carl
i dont think you ought to imply
that daddy was wrong in f ront of daddy
dont force him that way
how long have you been here
only two months
well satiety is my father and mother
carl
if youre finished
i think id like to go do some work

theres concerts on the mainland
i feel silly telling you this
this is your home
you know what there is to do

but the day after tomorrow
i will be f ree
carl has hydrotherapy on tuesdays
the day after tomorrow

one thing i find
very difficult to imagine
is that one could have this
incredible background in music
and walk away f rom it
without a second thought
i gave it a second thought
i mean how could you no longer play
at all i think thats very strange
i played a little bit here and there
as a matter of fact

twoeighteen
id hate to see you walk
across a concert stage like that
twonineteen
id get somebody to coach you

he does walk f unny dont you see that
i dont think id notice
im so used to carl
yeah well
bobby
do you think spicer is attractive
i think hes got a terrific personality
spicer was formerly a sailor
look dont you see that
look at that the guy is
sailors are sadistic i feel
you see theres nothing wrong
with my walk now where were we
at game carl
well thats three games to z carl
what do you say about a rematch
i thought youre going to the mainland
youll miss the ferry
just when i was hitting my stride say
goodbye to catherine for me will you

tell her ill be back sometime
tomorrow probably will you
where is she anyway
who
shopping in the village

spicer
whats the matter
nothing
robert
would you do something for me
would you play for me
catherine your game
catherine
will you
that was beautif ul im surprised
thank you
i was really very moved but
whats wrong
nothing its just i picked the easiest
piece that i could think of
and i first played it when i was 8
years old and i played it better then
cant you understand it was the feeling
i was affected by
i didnt have any
you had no inner feeling
none
well then i must
have been supplying it
maybe if you supply a little more
it might rub off on me who knows
i doubt it
i could get interested
well i couldnt
what does it have to be with you
grim and serious
look you played
i honestly responded
and you made me feel embarrassed
for having responded to you
it wasnt necessary
yeah it was i faked a little chopin
you faked a big response
i dont think thats accurate
all ive been getting f rom you is
meaningf ul looks at the dinner table
and vague suggestions about the day
i am not conscious
of having given you any looks
as for the day after tomorrow
this is the day after tomorrow
and i am unfortunately seeing you
if youll ex cuse me
id like to take a bath
what do you want anyway
some bath oil
some bath oil
how about some avocado or this
or some of this jasmine
how about this
what are you doing
what are you doing screwing around
with all this crap
i do not find your language
very charming
it isnt its direct
id like you to leave
so that i can take a bath
is that direct
serious
is that whats important to you
serious
yes
lets be serious sit down
dont do that
shut up
no inner feeling
i told him the truth finally
he was my husband
and i loved him very much
but it wasnt working any better
the second time than it did the first
he was a cellist
and there was i
no longer 17 looking up at him
and i said to him
joseph youre f ull of beans
and i left him
is that what you said to him
something like that
as a matter of fact joseph introduced
me to carl right around then
how are you
incredible
carl restored me he really did
hes much more substantial
than you give him credit for being
do you think you could discreetly
move across the hall now
yes i think i could discreetly
move across the hall now
robert
i have some f ree time tomorrow morning
before carl gets back if youd like
of course id like it
bananas bananas
you certainly do have a beautif ul piece
of real estate out here mr dupea
can he hear me
hes not hard of hearing
thats a blessing at least
this certainly is an improvement
on the motel and the coffee shop
how could you ever leave
such a beautif ul place
i dont know
youve been staying
in a motel all this time
for two weeks there wasnt hardly
nobody there to talk to but me
but why did you stay at the motel
theres plenty of room here
well i was going to
but bobby had to come up here
and feel it up here first
but then it took so long
i run flat out of money
you didnt leave me
any number or anything honey
and i had to you know
get in a taxi and come on out here
in the hopes that i would not
be intruding myself
no not at all
youre perfectly welcome to stay here
well thank you
thats a very nice thing for you to say
not at all
you have a beautif ul head of hair
thank you
is it natural
rayette

i havent been being fair to carl
i have to tell you that
what i cant hear you
im sorry everythings
been so conf using
ill see you later this evening
you see man is born into the world with
his existent adversary f rom the first
it is his historic mythic inheritance
is this startling
aggression is prehistoric
an organism behaves
according to its nature
which derives f rom the circumstances
of its inheritance
fact remains that primitive man took
delight in tearing his adversary apart
that is where i think
the core of the problem resides
doesnt that seem apocalyptic
i do not make poetry
is there a tv in the house
i remarked to john
that rationality is not
a device to alter facts
i think of it
as an extraneous tool a gadget
somewhat like the television
to look at it any other way
is ridiculous
theres some good things on it
i beg your pardon
the tv theres some
good things on it sometimes
i have strong doubts
nevertheless i am not discussing media
but there is always hope
for the few
what about love
what about it
wouldnt you say that more ill has been
done f rom love than f rom abomination
no no i wouldnt
well you are a romantic catherine
and once more about to be married
so you can be ex cused
f rom objective discussions
but ask carl
ask him if even the institution
of marriage is completely f ree f rom it
ask him
i think these cold
objective discussions are aggressive
ex cuse me
thats reactive
if i may say without dampening
the spirit of your adventure
you havent dampened my spirit
ex cuse me
i should hope not
but its still open to some dispute that
there seems to be less aggression
or violence if you like
im sorry i dont speak french
and loftier natures
what kind of doggy is this
this is a border collie
i had a pussycat once
it was a little fluffy thing
bobby gave it to me remember bobby
the little pussycat you gave me
yeah
had two little white f ront paws
and i was crazy after her
we left it at some f riends house
and she got squashed flat
as a tortilla outside their mobile home
there do you see what i mean
the choice of words juxtaposed
with the image of a fluffy kitten
the enchantment of words
squashed  flat  etcetera
well she was
perhaps but it was just
what i was trying to point out
dont sit there pointing at her
i beg your pardon
i said dont point at her you creep
but i was just
where do you get the ass to tell anybody
about class or what she typifies
you shouldnt even be
in the same room with her
this is really too much
just calm down
youre f ull of shit
youre all f ull of shit
catherine
catherine
i cant talk to you
leave me alone
what the hells going on
whatre you doing
whats
hey where
wheres catherine
i dont know where catherine is
im talking to you tita
i told you just to take
your hands off my sister nurse
move out
stop it
stop it stop it
hold it will you
hold it take it easy
take it easy will you
stop it let him go
you give up
do you give up do you
stop it stop it stop it
give up
stop
give up give up give up
bobby
i just wanted to talk to you
its useless
look give me a chance
im trying to be delicate with you
but you just wont understand
i couldnt go with you not because
of carl but because of you
youre a strange person robert
i mean what would it come to
a person who has no love for himself
no respect for himself
no love of his f riends
family work something
how can he ask for love in return
why should he ask for it
living here in this resthome asylum
thats what you want
yes
thatll make you happy
i hope it will yes
im sorry
okay
are you cold
i dont know if youd be
particularly interested
in hearing anything about me
my life i mean
most of it doesnt add up to much
that i could relate as a way
of life that youd approve of
i move around a lot
not because im looking
for anything really
but because im getting away
f rom things that get bad
if i stay
auspicious beginnings
you know what i mean
im trying to imagine youre
youre half of this conversation
my feeling is i dont know
that if you could talk
we wouldnt be talking
its pretty much the way
that it got to be before i left
are you all right
i dont know what to say
tita suggested that we try to
i dont know
i think that she feels
i think that she feels that weve got
some understanding to reach
she totally denies the fact
that we were never that comfortable
with one another to begin with
the best that i can do is apologize
we both know that i was never
really that good at it anyway
im sorry it didnt work out
bobby
youre leaving
yeah i said a week
i think i overstayed myself
you were going without
saying goodbye to me
i didnt want to say goodbye to anyone
but what about me
ill say goodbye to you tita
oh robert

bye
come on ray
i want to take a picture
of us in f ront of the place

thank you all for your hospitality

our place youll be more than welcome
bye now
your kiss is like a drink
when i am thirsty
oh and im thirsty for you
with all my heart
but dont love me then pretend
as though weve never kissed
dont touch me
dont touch me
cut it out
son of a bitch bobby
you quit pushing me away like that
ive had enough of that
to last me an entire lifetime
why dont you just
be good to me for a change

after you and love you as good as i do
