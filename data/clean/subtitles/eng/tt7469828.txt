traffic update  john 
you know  fred  i always
get this strange feeling
when i m stuck in traffic

away from other people
packed together on
a strip of asphalt 
yet we find ourselves
passing by each other
from the loneliness of
our respective tin cans 
you got the supply chain  right 
transportation of goods being   
your goal is to meet your
high value objectives 
ensure the supplier feels
good about the deal

fuck  yeah  i took him
down a half year ago
when we busted the
macdougal traffic ring 
low level sergeant 
oversaw one of the routes 
  he s out already 
  out on bond 
pictures of those girls
still haunt the web 
shell casings  prints 
fingerprints only
from the victim 
they ended him with a slug 
  nasty choice for a hit job 
  hmm 
other slug s in that
tree over there 
and you re retired
for how long now 
consultant gerick
at your service 
so  who s your new assistant 
ah  desk rat from legal 
wants field experience 
went to yale 
i heard they have a very
good english department 
mm 
strange 
paul came here
to pick up a girl
who d been transported
across the state line 
his normal routine 
but then   
why 
it s what we re
trying to figure out 
we got wider and deeper tracks
from the second vehicle 
it s probably a truck 
yeah  refrigerated
trailer or dry van 
no tarp 
all right  well  start by alerting
the weigh stations  finley 
excuse me  gerick  just 
please  call me by my last name 
  all right  yale 
  sterling 
you gonna make those calls or
you gonna write a poem about it 
i ll make the calls  just 
please  call me sterling 
yeah 
never seen you so
lazy  ms  sally 
sorry  frank  got a bad knee 
you got a lover in there  huh 
always 
uh huh  well  you ready to roll 
take these out to the car 
whoa 
  come on  come on 
  fine 
all right 
hey  so  state police
are doing us a favor
on the weigh stations 
and we got a match on
the muddy tire tracks
headed onto the south
highway entrance 
so mississippi  not tennessee 
  and   
  here 
yeah  gerick  i m
not your assistant 
this is my case  and i appreciate
having you on as a consultant 
but right now  we just need
you to sign this  and then   
we start with files
from last year 
i ll bet he was whacked by
one of his little buddies 
we take a look at
all known associates 
find out which one might ve
had a beef with paul 
and we re looking
for a girl  one 
he always bought
 em one at a time 
yeah  so we just need you to sign
this report for headquarters 
no time for bureaucracy  yale 
i think you re taking this
a bit too personally  sir 
  excuse me 
  i think you heard me 
all right  we re taking my car 
and let me know where we re
at with that cell phone 
okay  so we did
crack paul s phone 
it wasn t easy  with recent
numbers already being dead 
we couldn t trace it  and
no registered address 
but he did pay for the phone
bill with a credit card
that also paid the
utilities at an address 
good lung capacity there  yale 
what is that  ivy
league swim team 
i put in a request
for a warrant 
  ah  we re not waiting for that 
  gerick 
something s not right 
paul should ve called by now 
go back to your room 
be smart  stay in the back 
don t let anybody see you  okay 
hey  hey  you  hey 
who s that girl 
  what the fuck are you doing 
  goddamnit 
does anyone care that
i am working next door 
all right 
okay  let s get goin  
i always move the truck
after being seen outside
of this truck stop 
worst reputation on the road 
hmm  my brother  he s good 
champ  he ll help 
you got a brother 
sisters 
guess you don t have no
mom or dad either  huh 
what are you  baby jesus 
what s your name 
leila 
leila 
and that was the farmer
who found the body
  on a muddy back road off 25 
  mm hm  i see it 
  less than a mile north of the state border 
   yeah 
a brutal killing that s
hard to grapple with 
  how did it happen and why 
  that little girl s gonna tell on us 
no one s gonna tell on nobody 
the once quiet community is coming
to terms with what s happened
as the motive remains
unclear in the mud murder 
what would warrant such a
violent end to a person s life 
law enforcement is questioning
  the use of slugs   
  fuck me  who leaked 
  a particularly damaging bullet 
   not me 
it s a most unusual
find at the crime scene 
some lonesome cowboy wanting
his 15 minutes of fame 
police are looking
into the manner 
and this  for now 
is all we know
about the innocent victim 
innocent  my ass 
as the investigation proceeds 
no stone will be left unturned 
you can go to the police 
tell  em what he
would ve done to you 
that it was self defense 
hmm 
is where the crime took place 
spreading fear on what   
just don t bite and
kick  em  all right 
still hiding in the woods 
it s not yet confirmed   
i don t like the police 
but it is confirmed that the
manhunt covers both states 
you crying  cause you re scared  or you
crying  cause that piece of shit is dead 
you know  leila  you
might have shot him 
but i left him there to die 
we re in this together 
oh  we can t cross state lines 
it s too risky with
the weigh stations 
mm mm 
i ll get us to a place
where we can t be found 
we ll wait there till
my brother has a plan 
yes  patterson 
yes  i know  i know 
you have to see the girl in
order for me to get the warrant 
even if i need the warrant
to get the fucking girl 
you know  we might
still be able to get it 
i m afraid the idiots at
legal disagree with you  yale 
all right  well  i used
to work there  so   
i know that  you re the idiot
who refused to issue the warrant
that would ve kept paul
from getting out on bond 
okay  my buddy caught a
glimpse of a young girl
poking her head out of a
blue peterbilt yesterday 
said the truck was
headed south on 49 
called some of our friends down
there to be on the lookout 
can t hate  em much 
give me extra time off
when i got my daughter 
 cause we all know
34 hours ain t much 
yeah  i just sleep
and fuck through  em 
hey  sally 
headin  to louisville

nope  not any time soon 
yeah  can t go far from utica 
  that s right 
  no shame in that 
i only ran local  round new york
when my beau was at sing sing 
  it s her brother  dolly 
  beau  brother

cheat on ya and not the other 
  very funny 
  come on  sal

two syllable responses 
uh  sorry  pattie  been
having a rough time

florida is a dump 
i don t care if it s a dump when
you can go wherever you want

hey  stop that  stop that

the neighbor said she saw girls
walking in and out of the house 
 maybe should ve called someone   she

we found a dog in the basement 
we need a few minutes
to tranquilize it 
okay 
saunders 
neighbors say they saw the girls
walking around the neighborhood 
i don t understand 
why didn t they   
call the police 
ask for help  something 
these kids have been fucked over by the
system since the day they were born 
they don t call the police 
nobody gives a shit
and they know it 
they also know that if they
step out of line what happens 
that s what the basement is for 
  a kid had been in this cage 
  what 
a kid had been in this
cage  bolted to the wall 
dog was running loose 
from the looks of the dog 
it had been trained
to be aggressive 
traces of blood on the bolts 
looks like someone tried
to claw their way out 
fresh  couple of days 
we just missed them 
clothes in the cage 
pant size  dress size 
she s probably about
five feet  young 
and she found a
pencil to doodle with 
you know this place 
this truck stop s so big   
even the pimps don t
know their way around 
we can hide here till tomorrow 
okay 
let s go over the ground rules 
hair spray  aka pepper spray 
here 
man s coat stays on
the driver s seat 
makes them think
a guy lives here 
at night  curtains
closed  lights off 
lights on is an
invitation  right 
someone knocks  we don t open 
doors locked  windows up 
seatbelt wrapped
through the door handle
and fastened when
we re sleepin  
you sleep up top  i m
on the bottom  got it 
  got it 
  i do the shoppin  
but you do the
dishes  you stay here 
don t let nobody see you  okay 
  all right 
  that s it 
but i need to go to the store 
uh  didn t you hear what i said 
your underwear is huge on me 
would you prefer me to walk around
with  em gathered in my ass

shit about priority of resources  man

be locked in a basement 
no  you wouldn t
run  you d stay 
try to play the game  survive 
what the fuck would
you live on out there 
grass  clover 
best case scenario 
you re found and brought
right back into the system 
then you d run again 
sorry 
most of these kids
are held captive
just a few miles from
where they grew up 
in their minds they
got nowhere to go 
and for a lot of
 em  that s true 
same hair as in the basement 
thank you 
shouldn t we get   
shouldn t we get rid of that 
not an option  my mom gave it
to my brother before she died 
they find this   
they ve found us anyway 
you fire it  you clean it 
i see his eyes all the time 
you kill someone  cause
you wanna be free 
but then he still gets you 
how d you learn to shoot 
this guy cooper 
my mom left me with him
when she went to work 
he was buildin  an armory 
he always said if the world
went to shit    he d be ready 
do you ever feel lonely 
always 
just a few gallons of gas

  resources are so fucking scarce 
they re telling us to prioritize
only infants and toddlers 
patterson  we can catch
these fucking guys 
it s you and sterling 
gerick  that is it 
if we don t bring  em down now  they just
set up some place else and then what 
ten more girls  fifteen 
trafficking will not go away

like looking for a
needle in a haystack 
a semi is no needle though 
it stands out pretty
much anywhere 
if i was them   
i d duck into someplace
familiar and just lay low 
and a young girl with a trucker
might stand out just enough
for someone to
have taken notice 
  yeah 
  wait
