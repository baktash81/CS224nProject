down a half year ago
when we busted the
macdougal traffic ring
low level sergeant
oversaw one of the routes
hes out already
out on bond
pictures of those girls
still haunt the web
shell casings prints
fingerprints only
from the victim
they ended him with a slug
nasty choice for a hit job
hmm
other slugs in that
tree over there
and youre retired
for how long now
consultant gerick
at your service
so whos your new assistant
ah desk rat from legal
wants field experience
went to yale
i heard they have a very
good english department
mm
strange
paul came here
to pick up a girl
whod been transported
across the state line
his normal routine
but then
why
its what were
trying to figure out
we got wider and deeper tracks
from the second vehicle
its probably a truck
yeah refrigerated
trailer or dry van
no tarp
all right well start by alerting
the weigh stations finley
excuse me gerick just
please call me by my last name
all right yale
sterling
you gonna make those calls or
you gonna write a poem about it
ill make the calls just
please call me sterling
yeah
never seen you so
lazy ms sally
sorry frank got a bad knee
you got a lover in there huh
always
uhhuh well you ready to roll
take these out to the car
whoa
come on come on
fine
all right
hey so state police
are doing us a favor
on the weigh stations
and we got a match on
the muddy tire tracks
headed onto the south
highway entrance
so mississippi not tennessee
and
here
yeah gerick im
not your assistant
this is my case and i appreciate
having you on as a consultant
but right now we just need
you to sign this and then
we start with files
from last year
ill bet he was whacked by
one of his little buddies
we take a look at
all known associates
find out which one mightve
had a beef with paul
and were looking
for a girl one
he always bought
em one at a time
yeah so we just need you to sign
this report for headquarters
no time for bureaucracy yale
i think youre taking this
a bit too personally sir
excuse me
i think you heard me
all right were taking my car
and let me know where were
at with that cell phone
okay so we did
crack pauls phone
it wasnt easy with recent
numbers already being dead
we couldnt trace it and
no registered address
but he did pay for the phone
bill with a credit card
that also paid the
utilities at an address
good lung capacity there yale
what is that ivy
league swim team
i put in a request
for a warrant
ah were not waiting for that
gerick
somethings not right
paul shouldve called by now
go back to your room
be smart stay in the back
dont let anybody see you okay
hey hey you hey
whos that girl
what the fuck are you doing
goddamnit
does anyone care that
i am working next door
all right
okay lets get goin
i always move the truck
after being seen outside
of this truck stop
worst reputation on the road
hmm my brother hes good
champ hell help
you got a brother
sisters
guess you dont have no
mom or dad either huh
what are you baby jesus
whats your name
leila
leila
and that was the farmer
who found the body
on a muddy back road off 25
mmhm i see it
less than a mile north of the state border
yeah
a brutal killing thats
hard to grapple with
how did it happen and why
that little girls gonna tell on us
no ones gonna tell on nobody
the once quiet community is coming
to terms with whats happened
as the motive remains
unclear in the mud murder
what would warrant such a
violent end to a persons life
law enforcement is questioning
the use of slugs
fuck me who leaked
a particularly damaging bullet
not me
its a most unusual
find at the crime scene
some lonesome cowboy wanting
his 15 minutes of fame
police are looking
into the manner
and this for now
is all we know
about the innocent victim
innocent my ass
as the investigation proceeds
no stone will be left unturned
you can go to the police
tell em what he
wouldve done to you
that it was selfdefense
hmm
is where the crime took place
spreading fear on what
just dont bite and
kick em all right
still hiding in the woods
its not yet confirmed
i dont like the police
but it is confirmed that the
manhunt covers both states
you crying cause youre scared or you
crying cause that piece of shit is dead
you know leila you
might have shot him
but i left him there to die
were in this together
oh we cant cross state lines
its too risky with
the weigh stations
mmmm
ill get us to a place
where we cant be found
well wait there till
my brother has a plan
yes patterson
yes i know i know
you have to see the girl in
order for me to get the warrant
even if i need the warrant
to get the fucking girl
you know we might
still be able to get it
im afraid the idiots at
legal disagree with you yale
all right well i used
to work there so
i know that youre the idiot
who refused to issue the warrant
that wouldve kept paul
from getting out on bond
okay my buddy caught a
glimpse of a young girl
poking her head out of a
blue peterbilt yesterday
said the truck was
headed south on 49
called some of our friends down
there to be on the lookout
cant hate em much
give me extra time off
when i got my daughter
cause we all know
34 hours aint much
yeah i just sleep
and fuck through em
hey sally

no shame in that
i only ran local round new york

we found a dog in the basement
we need a few minutes
to tranquilize it
okay
saunders
neighbors say they saw the girls
walking around the neighborhood
i dont understand
why didnt they
call the police
ask for help something
these kids have been fucked over by the
system since the day they were born
they dont call the police
nobody gives a shit
and they know it
they also know that if they
step out of line what happens
thats what the basement is for
a kid had been in this cage
what
a kid had been in this
cage bolted to the wall
dog was running loose
from the looks of the dog
it had been trained
to be aggressive
traces of blood on the bolts
looks like someone tried
to claw their way out
fresh couple of days
we just missed them
clothes in the cage
pant size dress size
shes probably about
five feet young
and she found a
pencil to doodle with
you know this place
this truck stops so big
even the pimps dont
know their way around
we can hide here till tomorrow
okay
lets go over the ground rules
hair spray aka pepper spray
here
mans coat stays on
the drivers seat
makes them think
a guy lives here
at night curtains
closed lights off
lights on is an
invitation right
someone knocks we dont open
doors locked windows up
seatbelt wrapped
through the door handle
and fastened when
were sleepin
you sleep up top im
on the bottom got it
got it
i do the shoppin
but you do the
dishes you stay here
dont let nobody see you okay
all right
thats it
but i need to go to the store
uh didnt you hear what i said
your underwear is huge on me
would you prefer me to walk around
with em gathered in my ass
this it
its for my niece
well how do you like that
i see you more than
i see my own family
and i didnt even
know you had a niece
oh come on patterson dont give me this
shit about priority of resources man
this is a fucking
priority fuck

yeah
fuck
youve been at this
what 30 40 years
fifty
still gets you riled up huh
how the hell can it not
why dont they run
you know because i would
anything to get away
from that hellhole
fuck no you youd
be locked in a basement
no you wouldnt
run youd stay
try to play the game survive
what the fuck would
you live on out there
grass clover
best case scenario
youre found and brought
right back into the system
then youd run again
sorry
most of these kids
are held captive
just a few miles from
where they grew up
in their minds they
got nowhere to go
and for a lot of
em thats true
same hair as in the basement
thank you
shouldnt we get
shouldnt we get rid of that
not an option my mom gave it
to my brother before she died
they find this
theyve found us anyway
you fire it you clean it
i see his eyes all the time
you kill someone cause
you wanna be free
but then he still gets you
howd you learn to shoot
this guy cooper
my mom left me with him
when she went to work
he was buildin an armory
he always said if the world

if we dont bring em down now they just
set up some place else and then what
ten more girls fifteen
trafficking will not go away

you couldve just told me
none of your fucking business
like looking for a
needle in a haystack
a semi is no needle though
it stands out pretty
much anywhere
if i was them
id duck into someplace
familiar and just lay low
and a young girl with a trucker
might stand out just enough
for someone to
have taken notice
yeah
wait
youre not suggesting
we go analog
and go to every truck stop ever
cause theres theres many
there arent that many
and a guy like this wont stray
far from his comfort zone
