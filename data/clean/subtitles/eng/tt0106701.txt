mr  wilson 
poor old mr  wilson must be so sick 
no wonder he ain t up 
wow 
his heart sounds like our washing machine 
oh  no 
he s growing extra skin 
his tongue s very ugly   
   and blue and spotty 
cool 
he feels warm 
he has a temperature 
i know what you need 
you need an aspirin 
don t you ever come back 
do you hear me 
never 
starting part time will give you a chance
to ease back into it 
i mean  managing shopping malls
can t be much more difficult   
   than managing dennis 
where have you been 
dennis 
dennis 
i was at mr  wilson s house 
and  boy  is he sick 
he s got a fever  and he s burning up 
i better call martha 
you didn t bother him  did you 
no  but i gave him an aspirin 
and he don t like them any better than me 
you shouldn t visit people
so early in the morning 
that s the only time i know for sure
they ll be home 
hello  george  alice mitchell 
are you feeling all right 
dennis said that you   
feeling all right 
your son just shot an aspirin
down my throat with a slingshot 
i m very sorry 
you better talk to him 
we ll talk to him 
when i was a child 
none of this would have been tolerated 
 bye   bye 
hi 
did you shoot an aspirin
into mr  wilson s mouth 
i didn t want him to bite off my fingers
with his big  fake teeth 
those things are sharp 
george said dennis shot an aspirin
into his mouth with a slingshot 
what slingshot 
  do you have a slingshot 
  i m not sure 
give it to me 
mr  wilson is very angry with you 
i thought he was sick 
i was only trying to help 
you go sit in the corner
and think about what you ve done 
  for how long 
  until you re sorry 
oh  good  i m sorry now 
he can t sit in the corner 
i have to take him
to margaret wade s house 
margaret s house 
i didn t do anything bad enough
to deserve to go to her house 
she s a lunatic  i ll go crazy 
she tortures me 
she s mean  she s ugly 
she doesn t share 
i arranged with mrs  wade for you
to go to their house while i work 
are you serious 
you can t spend the summer unsupervised 
you re out of school 
i ll go back 
your mother made arrangements 
that s it  i don t want any arguments 
my life is falling apart 
hello  george 
let me take that off your hands  sorry 
i m   
i m sorry about this morning 
i won t mince words  mitchell 
your kid is driving me nuts 
  i ll talk to him again 
  maybe it isn t talk that he needs 
when my dad had something important
to tell me  he told me with his belt 
that s not how i deal with my son 
mr  wilson 
however you deal with him   
   he hasn t learned you don t shoot
an aspirin down a fellow s throat 
  mr  wilson  he s five 
  when i was five  i had some respect 
you were probably an exceptional boy 
in 1925  i was not the exception 
i was the rule 
i ll make sure
dennis doesn t come by anymore 
careful how you say it 
i don t want everybody to think
i m a child hater or an ogre 
i m a reasonable man
who expects reasonable treatment   
   from his neighbors and their children 
i was with the post office
for more than 43 years  and never once   
i m running a little late 
i ll come by after work
and we can continue the conversation 
there s nothing to continue 
i ve said my piece  we ll leave it at that 
the boy cannot come over here
unless he behaves himself 
he won t be over at all 
now don t make me out to be a grump 
i didn t say  never    i said   
i really have to go 
well  now  don t   
have a good day 
he s out of school now 
he can t spend all his free time here 
i m not the bad guy in this  mitchell 
i m the victim 
george  who were you shouting at 
mitchell  and i wasn t shouting 
i was making my point 
it s not right that his youngster
can run wild doing as he pleases   
   without regard to people or property 
he s only a boy  george 
he ll knot my rope once too often 
i can t stand that kid  he s a menace 
you d better come in and have breakfast 
we re due at the garden club at 9 00 
today is an important day for me  and
i m already in a lather because of that kid 
i don t know if i ll even be able
to enjoy my moment of triumph 
don t get your hopes up 
there are lots of other gardens in town
just as nice as yours 
please  i m a shoe in 
who else has a night blooming mock orchid
flowering this year 
it s an awfully homely looking plant 
hang the looks of the thing 
it opens before your eyes
in the light of the full moon 
it s a marvel  martha 
forty years to mature and blossom 
the flower opens and withers
in a matter of moments 
there isn t a gardener in town
with a plant that requires   
   a 40 year investment
for 10 seconds of splendor 
how do you feel about me working 
a lot of moms work 
the best i could do finding someone
to watch you is mrs  wade 
what about joey 
did you think about him 
what if he comes over 
he ll think i moved 
joey s mother made plans
with mrs  wade just like i did 
joey s at margaret s house 
do it 
  i can make you 
  how 
i ll slug you back 
  you can t hit a girl 
  i can too 
try it  i ll scream
so awfully  bloody  deadly horrible   
   my mom ll think you tried to murder me 
i ll say you did and she ll believe it 
because boys are like that and girls aren t 
that really stinks 
quit wasting time 
mush your lips together
and let s get this over with 
close your eyes 
kiss me 
all right  let s go 
dennis  come on 
oh  gosh 
acting like a baby 
get up 
right this instant 
don t you dare embarrass me 
fine  i ll drag you inside 
you guys are the boring ones 
there s lots to do 
oh  really  like what 
we could practice singing songs 
or put on a play   
   or a puppet show 
  we could bury you alive 
  i could pound your face 
it doesn t matter  anyways  margaret 
we ll be leaving soon
and we have work to do 
we re going to make a fort 
you can t leave unless i go with you 
or i ll tell on you 
so  tough kitty paws  i m going 
climb down from there  i ll get my purse 
this thing s been here our whole life
and we never knew it 
  do you think anybody lives in it 
  just squirrels and birds 
it looks kind of junky 
we ll fix it up 
good  i ll be the decorator 
we ll put on a special room for the babies
and a powder room for guests 
forts don t have powder rooms 
really 
where do the soldiers  wives go
to freshen up 
soldiers don t have wives  stupid 
don t call me stupid  baby rump kisser 
it won t be a fort  it ll be a house 
a love nest 
let s go up and see
what color carpet we should get 
do forts got carpet 
nope 
forts don t got carpet 
they do now  hot lips 
the selection committee has informed   
   mrs  butterwell and i   
   that this summer s floraganza
will be held in the garden of   
can you read this here 
you take these and i ll take those 
there we go  the garden of   
   george wilson 
one mississippi 
two mississippi  three mississippi   
   four mississippi  five mississippi 
six mississippi   
   seven mississippi  eight mississippi 
nine mississippi 
gunther  are you watching
where everybody goes 
yep 
girls  now   
let s go 
you know 
i was unbeatable at hide and seek 
hiding or seeking 
both  i had a nose for hiding places 
i wouldn t think you d be much good
at hiding 
why not 
weren t you a fat boy 
i was husky 
ready or not  here i come 
i see joey and mike 
run  mikey 
he s cheating 
what are you doing 
dennis is cheating 
he s using the beckman kid as a spy 
leave them alone  george 
i ll even things up 
gunther  i m just talking to your daddy
on the telephone 
he s going to the ice cream store 
he wants to take you with him 
hurry up and go home 
now it s fair 
you lied to a toddler  george 
think how disappointed he will be
when he gets home 
he better get used to it 
disappointment will be a big part of his life 
he s a foot short for his age 
and he s cross eyed 
ain t that a pretty sight 
i bet they don t even lock their doors 
you won t notice a toy store
on the first level   
   but my suggestion is this 
give the toy store six months free rent
to move up to the third level 
when i go to the mall with my little boy 
we always visit the toy store 
he knows he won t get anything unless
it s a special occasion  but like every kid   
   he wants to look around   
could you spare us the family anecdotes 
there s always a lot of traffic in toy stores 
if people have to go up to the third level
to visit the toy store   
   then they have to go through
two other levels to get there 
that s apparent to anyone with children 
and you have to assume
that potential tenants   
   might have kids and would know that   
   and it might entice them
to take up space in the other levels 
that s all i m saying 
we could have carried up a lot more stuff   
   if you didn t have to bring that idiotic doll
and all her junk 
she s not idiotic 
she s an important training tool 
you know why men are so lousy
when it comes to taking care of babies 
they have better things to do 
like what  play golf and drink beer 
no  like hunting  having wars  driving cars 
shaving  cleaning fish 
do you know how to do that 
me 
margaret 
oh  okay 
if you didn t have women 
you wouldn t have babies   
   and you wouldn t have people 
if you didn t have men 
who d drive the ladies to the hospital 
most important  they marry the women 
then the women can go and get the baby 
the baby is in her stomach 
she has to get it installed 
her stomach isn t just filled up with babies 
  who installs them 
  a minister and a doctor 
  how 
  how 
she wants to know how 
tell me  dennis  how 
the bellybutton  it opens up 
  how come men have them 
  so they don t look weird in bathing suits 
okay  on the count of three   
   move your hand 
one 
two 
three 
okay  this time on the count of four 
one 
two 
three 
four 
joey  you hold the hammer
and  margaret  you hold the nail 
we did a pretty good job 
  how about a little paint 
  couldn t hurt 
  you got any 
  my dad does 
  give me my doll  you jerk 
  i don t have it 
  give it to me  dennis 
  i didn t take your doll 
it s not here  somebody took it 
we ve been with you 
do you guys swear you didn t take it 
yep 
i ve been robbed 
you don t understand 
baby louise is a very expensive antique 
nobody robbed your doll 
  maybe a bear ate it 
  what 
yeah  there s no robbers in our town 
what are you eating there  sport 
a apple 
hi  mr  mitchell 
hello  polly  come on in 
  what s the helmet for 
  my girlfriend used to baby sit for dennis 
she said to bring a helmet and wear pants 
i m looking for polly 
you re mickey 
yeah 
she s up in my mom s bathroom
using the armpit perfume 
she says you re such a stud 
she gets nervous and sweats a lot 
cool 
come on in 
tastes funny 
tastes like paint 
and wood 
i ll make us some sandwiches 
  do not cry  little locomotive     
     said old engine number 99 to huffy 
  one day when you grow up 
you will realize   
      that all trains are impotent  important   
      even little mail trains    
how can a train grow 
he eats all his coal
and gets plenty of sleep 
no  what s the point of reading lies 
it teaches kids to eat all their food   
   and go to bed when they re supposed to 
and not cry when mean cabooses
and boxcars make fun of them 
this is so stupid 
are you ready to get out of here
and go to bed  yet 
i m not even wrinkled up yet 
keep reading 
  i will never be big enough to pull anything
but silly old mail cars     
     sobbed huffy 
 sob   
 sobbobed huffy   
where are you going 
i m going to investigate mitchell s garage 
dennis has been fooling around with paint 
i know it  and i will prove it 
aren t you taking this a bit far  george 
he s only a boy 
kids 
g d  wading pool 
that s it 
gee  i guess those kids took off 
i got him this time 
mitchell can t deny it 
sorry  good night 
he s only a boy  huh 
hi  mrs  wilson 
is mr  wilson up yet 
not yet  dear 
how long do you think he s going to sleep 
not too much longer 
he s having his picture taken this morning 
  for what 
  he s being honored for his garden 
do you think he would get mad
if i went upstairs 
what do you want to go upstairs for 
i made an  i m sorry i shot paint
on your chicken  card 
that s very nice  dennis 
i m kind of busy today 
so i won t have a chance to give it to him 
i have to go to margaret s house   
   because we re getting poor 
and my mom s got a job now 
could i leave it by his whisker cutter 
that s where i leave
my dad s  sorry  cards 
and it s a good time to say you re sorry 
grownup guys are happy in the morning
when they wake up 
my dad s so happy   
   he whistles
when he goes to the bathroom 
the only time he isn t happy
is on sunday morning   
   when he and my mom wrestle 
they like to be alone when they do that 
i think it s because they take off
their shirts 
then they start to make funny noises   
you can go up   
   as long as you promise
not to disturb mr  wilson 
i promise 
you know what  mrs  wilson 
what 
you re the nicest old gal on the block 
hello 
my name is dennis mitchell

and i don t want any trouble 
my advice to you

and play war 
  is that pirates  gold 
  no 
is it real valuable 
yes 
is that why you keep it in your safe 
uh huh 
how come your safe looks like books 
how come you ask so many questions 
i ve only been around for five years 
there s a lot of stuff i don t know 
the safe looks like books   
   so if a thief does come in 
he won t recognize it 
  is a thief a robber 
  yes 
  have you ever had a robber here 
  no 
what s the combination to your lock 
you re the last person in the world
i d tell that to 
you ve got it wrote down someplace 
it s in my head 
  what s that mean 
  it means i know it  i remember it 
  what if you forget it 
  i won t forget it  it s a familiar number 
i won t forget it 
what s that mean 
it means it s a number
that i use all the time  so i won t forget it 
i use it all the time 
  i bet i know what it is 
  i doubt that 
i bet it s your address 
know how i know 
my friend has a bike lock   
   and he uses his address
for the combination so he won t forget 
  you re just as smart as him 
  he 
you got everything figured out  don t you 
i haven t figured out
how to get my work done   
   with you in the house 
that s a tough one 
are you wrinkled enough yet  dennis 
  yep 
  want me to come help you out of the tub 
not unless you want to see
what the stork saw 
cool 
old faithful 
  how old is this bed 
  it belonged to my mother 
what s she sleeping on 
she s been gone for many years  dennis 
  on business 
  no 
she s in heaven 
there s an awful lot of people in heaven 
especially old people 
how about if i recite my favorite poem
when i was your age 
  is it about flowers and lambs 
  no 
okay 
 wynken  blynken  and nod one night
 sailed off in a wooden shoe
 sailed on a river of crystal light
 into a sea of dew
  where are you going
and what do you wish   
 the old moon asked the three
  we have come to fish for the herring fish
that live in the beautiful sea
  nets of silver and gold have we   
 said wynken  blynken  and nod
 wynken and blynken are two little eyes
 and nod is a little head
 and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
 is a wee one s trundle bed
 now shut your eyes while mother sings
 of wonderful sights that be
 and you shall see the beautiful things
 as you rock in the misty sea
 where the old shoe
rocked the fishermen three
 wynken
 blynken
 and nod 
new pajamas  god bless  em 
poor thing 
i wish he d get that hernia fixed 
george  are you sleeping 
i was until you started yakking 
i m sorry 
was dennis in our bathroom 
yes 
i think the little rat
put mouthwash in my nasal spray   
   and toilet cleanser in my mouthwash 
why would he do something like that 
must you ask 
quiet 
i recited a poem for dennis tonight   
   that my mother used to recite to me 
i remembered every word 
in some tiny measure   
   my mother would be proud
i passed something on 
it s 10 00  martha 
don t start with the regrets 
i would have been a good mother 
and i would have made a swell fireman 
  where are you going 
  to make myself a cup of tea 
i didn t decree
that we wouldn t have children 
that was out of both our hands 
this isn t about having children
or not having children 
you miss the point 
it s about   
   my feeling something very good   
   and not being able to tell you about it 
martha 
i didn t mean to hurt you 
i m not terribly good
with feelings and emotions 
there are a lot of subjects
i d just as soon not bring up or discuss 
i would have liked a son or a daughter 
you couldn t fire the fatherly feelings
in me   
   because they re not there 
but that doesn t mean my feelings for you
have gone cold 
that ll never happen 
you ve got all the love i have 
remember this 
je t aime  je t adore  ma petite chérie 
george 
get out of here 
what are you looking for now 
garden lanterns 
you must be pretty brave to ride
on a tiger in your underpants 
put that away  that s not for kids 
martha 
where are the g d  garden lanterns 
i think i better go outside and play 
hello 
hello  martha 
it s alice 
i m still in oklahoma 
oh  dear 
yes  there s a terrible storm 
my flight s been cancelled 
till the weather clears 
i don t know what s going to happen 
i know your garden party s tonight 
i feel terrible 
i don t know what to do 
don t worry about it 
you get home when you can 
we ll be just fine here 
what s george going to say 
over my dead body 
this is my crowning moment of retired life
and i won t throw it away like the trash   
   for a ninny who can t get her keister
to the airport on time 
george wilson 
you have no right to insult alice 
she can t help the weather 
any more than you or i 
it s just plain bad luck 
it s no one s fault 
a tragedy of this magnitude
has to be somebody s fault 
it isn t a tragedy 
a little boy s going to join us for a party 
if you want to forsake your neighbors
when they need help  do it alone 
why is it  when everyone else
feasts on the pleasures of life   
   i get the indigestion 
because you re an old grump 
we did a pretty good job 
uh huh 
now we can order furniture
and major appliances 
well  dennis   
   your mother did not arrive 
  nope 
this is an important event for me 
i know 
i don t want any nonsense 
you mind whatever manners you have
and don t be a pest 
okay 
don t embarrass me 
okay 
cheek pinchers 
look at the cute little boy 
are you our little host 
the party s in the back 
ladies  girls  the party s in the back 
thank you very much 
it s just this way  thank you 
don t embarrass me 
attention  everyone 
gather over here  please 
have a seat 
it s time to begin the ceremony 
all right  members  don t be timid 
move down front  plenty of seats 
either side  either side 
 on behalf of the garden club   
 selection committee 
   we d like to present   
   george wilson   
 with this beautiful     
what does that say 
 plague    what does that mean 
  here  let me have your glasses 
  no  i   
 plaque    come on up  george 
thank you  everyone  i am honored 
i will cherish this forever 
forty years ago   
   when i started this garden 
i planted a seed 
from that tiny seed   
   grew this grand plant 
tonight   
   for the first and only time
in its entire life  it will blossom 
as we await this glorious moment   
   martha and i invite you
to have some desert and coffee 
congratulations 
george  would you bring the coffee 
george  don t start  george 
could you get somebody
to come and clear this away 
i made a mistake 
mr  wilson 
somebody robbed your house 
forty years down the drain 
you re a pest 
a menace 
a selfish  spoiled little boy
and i have no use for you 
you took something from me
that i can never get back 
something that means more to me
than you ever will 
you understand 
i don t want to see you 
i don t want to know you 
get out of my way 
i m sorry  mr  wilson 
party s over  everybody  go on home 
i m sorry 
oh  my god 
where s dennis 
joey hasn t seen him all night 
okay 
well  if he shows up  please call me 
 bye 
  did you call the wades 
  yes 
but that s the last place he d go 
don t you ever come back here again 
he s a menace 
turn that off 
don t make a pest of yourself
and don t embarrass me 
i don t want to know you 
i don t want to see you 
get out of my way 
these woods are pretty scary at night 
i m sure glad i ran into a grownup 
it ll work out real nice 
  you can be my hostage 
  cool 
i can only be your hostage till tomorrow 
i have church in the morning 
you ain t going to church 
you and me are catching the midnight train
out of here 
really 
we better stop at my house first 
i have to tell my mom and dad   
   or else they ll worry 
and i must get clean underwear
and my camera   
   and tell my parents to feed my fish   
   some sun block   
   and vitamins and stuff to play with
on the train so i don t get bored 
put a cork in it 
you re giving me a headache 
i don t have a cork 
shut your mouth 
i can t because my nose is stuffy
because of my allergies 
if i shut my mouth  i can t breathe good 
then keep your mouth open  but don t talk 
where do you put the cork
when you put a cork in it 
didn t i ask you to shut your yap 
what s a yap 
it s your mouth 
i can t shut my mouth
because my nose is stuffy 
shut up 
i have one more question 
what 
what does a hostage have to do 
nothing 
how come you need one 
in case the cops show up 
do i get to use a gun 
you get to stand in front of me
if the cops use a gun 
i ve got a slingshot 
swell 
i m a good shot  want to see 
excuse me  mister  do you want to see 
mister  can you watch me for a minute 
i ll tell you when to look 
look 
your fire s getting puny 
when my dad s fire gets puny 
he wiggles it around and it gets bigger 
dennis 
dennis 
i m sorry
you re not having a very fun camping trip 
nobody shoots a marble at my head   
   and sets my pants on fire 
that was an accident 
there ain t going to be no more accidents 
turn around 
you re doing it wrong 
get lost 
i tied up lots of guys in my life 
i bet you ve never tied up a 5 year old 
i ll just get out 
i ll tie it so tight
you won t be able to move 
the rope s too big and my legs are
too small to make it tight enough 
there s only one way to do it
and i know because   
   many people have tried to tie me up
but it doesn t work 
but you try your way 
i ll get out
and you ll just have to keep doing it 
what do you do differently 
first  you must tie up each leg by itself 
then you tie them together 
no matter how much i wiggle 
i can t ever get out 
if you really don t want me to move at all   
bend down 
you can t get out of that at all  right 
nope 
you tie me up like that  no matter
how much i try  i can t ever get out 
thanks 
  now let me loose 
  okay 
get the handcuff key 
  where is it 
  on my bag 
what 
dennis 
dennis 
i m going to kill you 
how  you can t move  open up 
i ain t hungry 
it s the only way to get the key 
you can t waste food 
plus  you must eat your dinner 
come on 
come on 
it s coming 
too hot 
you must have swallowed it 
i swallowed my allowance once 
i had to wait a whole night and a day
to get it back 
dennis 
firewood  bombs away 
poor little lamb 
he must be exhausted 
i better cover him up
so he doesn t catch his death of cold 
there we go 
what s he got a purse for 
holy smokes 
he s rich 
don t worry  i got it 
i got it  i got it 
dennis 
i ve lost the only man i ever loved 
i ll get you out of there 
you shouldn t jump in a river
with handcuffs on  for god s sake 
you could drown 
hold on  i m coming 
hey  mister 
good thing i know a lot about ropes  huh 
that s my boy 
mr  wilson taught me how to tie knots 
when i get you out  i m going to bed 
i m beat 
it must be all the fresh air 
hold on  i m coming 
there you go  now just pull yourself in 
this is mr  wilson s gold 
  how come you got it 
  i stole it 
you re a robber 
i m a thief 
say your prayers  little rat 
i can t  i didn t take my bath yet 
have it your own way 
martha

dennis 
mom  dad 
oh  sweetheart  thank god  you re okay

mister 
you forgot something 
dennis 
i like that rhubarb pie that martha makes 
  wonderful dinner 
  thank you  henry 
alice  your coffee 
guess what 
i won t have to travel anymore 
that s nice 
they want me to work on the project here 
they agreed to start a daycare center
so i can take dennis with me to work 
that s ridiculous 
what the heck s he going to do all day 
don t be foolish 
we re right next door  we can watch him 
well  of course  we d love to 
i don t think   
i mean  you must remember back
to all the times dennis upset you 
this is a new ball game 
i ve learned a few things 
kids are kids 
you have to play by their rules 
if you can t do that  you re in trouble 
you must roll with the punches 
you must expect the unexpected 
aren t you supposed to be
in the daycare area with the other children 
that s where i was  but i had to leave 
the lady who watches the kids said   
   if she had to look at me
for five more seconds   
   she d jump out the window 
she s a pretty nice lady   
   so i wouldn t want her to do that
