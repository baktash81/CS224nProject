mr wilson
poor old mr wilson must be so sick
no wonder he aint up
wow
his heart sounds like our washing machine
oh no
hes growing extra skin
his tongues very ugly
and blue and spotty
cool
he feels warm
he has a temperature
i know what you need
you need an aspirin
dont you ever come back
do you hear me
never
starting part time will give you a chance
to ease back into it
i mean managing shopping malls
cant be much more difficult
than managing dennis
where have you been
dennis
dennis
i was at mr wilsons house
and boy is he sick
hes got a fever and hes burning up
i better call martha
you didnt bother him did you
no but i gave him an aspirin
and he dont like them any better than me
you shouldnt visit people
so early in the morning
thats the only time i know for sure
theyll be home
hello george alice mitchell
are you feeling all right
dennis said that you
feeling all right
your son just shot an aspirin
down my throat with a slingshot
im very sorry
you better talk to him
well talk to him
when i was a child
none of this would have been tolerated
bye bye
hi
did you shoot an aspirin
into mr wilsons mouth
i didnt want him to bite off my fingers
with his big fake teeth
those things are sharp
george said dennis shot an aspirin
into his mouth with a slingshot
what slingshot
do you have a slingshot
im not sure
give it to me
mr wilson is very angry with you
i thought he was sick
i was only trying to help
you go sit in the corner
and think about what youve done
for how long
until youre sorry
oh good im sorry now
he cant sit in the corner
i have to take him
to margaret wades house
margarets house
i didnt do anything bad enough
to deserve to go to her house
shes a lunatic ill go crazy
she tortures me
shes mean shes ugly
she doesnt share
i arranged with mrs wade for you
to go to their house while i work
are you serious
you cant spend the summer unsupervised
youre out of school
ill go back
your mother made arrangements
thats it i dont want any arguments
my life is falling apart
hello george
let me take that off your hands sorry
im
im sorry about this morning
i wont mince words mitchell
your kid is driving me nuts
ill talk to him again
maybe it isnt talk that he needs
when my dad had something important
to tell me he told me with his belt
thats not how i deal with my son
mr wilson
however you deal with him
he hasnt learned you dont shoot
an aspirin down a fellows throat
mr wilson hes five
when i was five i had some respect
you were probably an exceptional boy
in 1925 i was not the exception
i was the rule
ill make sure
dennis doesnt come by anymore
careful how you say it
i dont want everybody to think
im a childhater or an ogre
im a reasonable man
who expects reasonable treatment
from his neighbors and their children
i was with the post office
for more than 43 years and never once
im running a little late
ill come by after work
and we can continue the conversation
theres nothing to continue
ive said my piece well leave it at that
the boy cannot come over here
unless he behaves himself
he wont be over at all
now dont make me out to be a grump
i didnt say never  i said
i really have to go
well now dont
have a good day
hes out of school now
he cant spend all his free time here
im not the bad guy in this mitchell
im the victim
george who were you shouting at
mitchell and i wasnt shouting
i was making my point
its not right that his youngster
can run wild doing as he pleases
without regard to people or property
hes only a boy george
hell knot my rope once too often
i cant stand that kid hes a menace
youd better come in and have breakfast
were due at the garden club at 900
today is an important day for me and
im already in a lather because of that kid
i dont know if ill even be able
to enjoy my moment of triumph
dont get your hopes up
there are lots of other gardens in town
just as nice as yours
please im a shoein
who else has a nightblooming mock orchid
flowering this year
its an awfully homely looking plant
hang the looks of the thing
it opens before your eyes
in the light of the full moon
its a marvel martha
forty years to mature and blossom
the flower opens and withers
in a matter of moments
there isnt a gardener in town
with a plant that requires
a 40year investment
for 10 seconds of splendor
how do you feel about me working
a lot of moms work
the best i could do finding someone
to watch you is mrs wade
what about joey
did you think about him
what if he comes over
hell think i moved
joeys mother made plans
with mrs wade just like i did
joeys at margarets house
do it
i can make you
how
ill slug you back
you cant hit a girl
i can too
try it ill scream
so awfully bloody deadly horrible
my momll think you tried to murder me
ill say you did and shell believe it
because boys are like that and girls arent
that really stinks
quit wasting time
mush your lips together
and lets get this over with
close your eyes
kiss me
all right lets go
dennis come on
oh gosh
acting like a baby
get up
right this instant
dont you dare embarrass me
fine ill drag you inside
you guys are the boring ones
theres lots to do
oh really like what
we could practice singing songs
or put on a play
or a puppet show
we could bury you alive
i could pound your face
it doesnt matter anyways margaret
well be leaving soon
and we have work to do
were going to make a fort
you cant leave unless i go with you
or ill tell on you
so tough kitty paws im going
climb down from there ill get my purse
this things been here our whole life
and we never knew it
do you think anybody lives in it
just squirrels and birds
it looks kind of junky
well fix it up
good ill be the decorator
well put on a special room for the babies
and a powder room for guests
forts dont have powder rooms
really
where do the soldiers wives go
to freshen up
soldiers dont have wives stupid
dont call me stupid baby rump kisser
it wont be a fort itll be a house
a love nest
lets go up and see
what color carpet we should get
do forts got carpet
nope
forts dont got carpet
they do now hot lips
the selection committee has informed
mrs butterwell and i
that this summers floraganza
will be held in the garden of
can you read this here
you take these and ill take those
there we go the garden of
george wilson
one mississippi
two mississippi three mississippi
four mississippi five mississippi
six mississippi
seven mississippi eight mississippi
nine mississippi
gunther are you watching
where everybody goes
yep
girls now
lets go
you know
i was unbeatable at hideandseek
hiding or seeking
both i had a nose for hiding places
i wouldnt think youd be much good
at hiding
why not
werent you a fat boy
i was husky
ready or not here i come
i see joey and mike
run mikey
hes cheating
what are you doing
dennis is cheating
hes using the beckman kid as a spy
leave them alone george
ill even things up
gunther im just talking to your daddy
on the telephone
hes going to the icecream store
he wants to take you with him
hurry up and go home
now its fair
you lied to a toddler george
think how disappointed he will be
when he gets home
he better get used to it
disappointment will be a big part of his life
hes a foot short for his age
and hes crosseyed
aint that a pretty sight
i bet they dont even lock their doors
you wont notice a toy store
on the first level
but my suggestion is this
give the toy store six months free rent
to move up to the third level
when i go to the mall with my little boy
we always visit the toy store
he knows he wont get anything unless
its a special occasion but like every kid
he wants to look around
could you spare us the family anecdotes
theres always a lot of traffic in toy stores
if people have to go up to the third level
to visit the toy store
then they have to go through
two other levels to get there
thats apparent to anyone with children
and you have to assume
that potential tenants
might have kids and would know that
and it might entice them
to take up space in the other levels
thats all im saying
we could have carried up a lot more stuff
if you didnt have to bring that idiotic doll
and all her junk
shes not idiotic
shes an important training tool
you know why men are so lousy
when it comes to taking care of babies
they have better things to do
like what play golf and drink beer
no like hunting having wars driving cars
shaving cleaning fish
do you know how to do that
me
margaret
oh okay
if you didnt have women
you wouldnt have babies
and you wouldnt have people
if you didnt have men
whod drive the ladies to the hospital
most important they marry the women
then the women can go and get the baby
the baby is in her stomach
she has to get it installed
her stomach isnt just filled up with babies
who installs them
a minister and a doctor
how
how
she wants to know how
tell me dennis how
the bellybutton it opens up
how come men have them
so they dont look weird in bathing suits
okay on the count of three
move your hand
one
two
three
okay this time on the count of four
one
two
three
four
joey you hold the hammer
and margaret you hold the nail
we did a pretty good job
how about a little paint
couldnt hurt
you got any
my dad does
give me my doll you jerk
i dont have it
give it to me dennis
i didnt take your doll
its not here somebody took it
weve been with you
do you guys swear you didnt take it
yep
ive been robbed
you dont understand
baby louise is a very expensive antique
nobody robbed your doll
maybe a bear ate it
what
yeah theres no robbers in our town
what are you eating there sport
a apple
hi mr mitchell
hello polly come on in
whats the helmet for
my girlfriend used to babysit for dennis
she said to bring a helmet and wear pants

using the armpit perfume
she says youre such a stud
she gets nervous and sweats a lot
cool
come on in
tastes funny
tastes like paint
and wood
ill make us some sandwiches
do not cry little locomotive
said old engine number 99 to huffy
one day when you grow up
you will realize
that all trains are impotent important
even little mail trains
how can a train grow
he eats all his coal
and gets plenty of sleep
no whats the point of reading lies
it teaches kids to eat all their food
and go to bed when theyre supposed to
and not cry when mean cabooses
and boxcars make fun of them
this is so stupid
are you ready to get out of here
and go to bed yet
im not even wrinkled up yet
keep reading
i will never be big enough to pull anything
but silly old mail cars
sobbed huffy
sob
sobbobed huffy
where are you going
im going to investigate mitchells garage
dennis has been fooling around with paint
i know it and i will prove it
arent you taking this a bit far george
hes only a boy

i got him this time
mitchell cant deny it
sorry good night

my dads sorry cards

grownup guys are happy in the morning
when they wake up
my dads so happy
he whistles
when he goes to the bathroom
the only time he isnt happy
is on sunday morning
when he and my mom wrestle
they like to be alone when they do that

old faithful
how old is this bed

no
shes in heaven
theres an awful lot of people in heaven
especially old people
how about if i recite my favorite poem
when i was your age
is it about flowers and lambs
no
okay
wynken blynken and nod one night
sailed off in a wooden shoe
sailed on a river of crystal light
into a sea of dew
where are you going
and what do you wish
the old moon asked the three
we have come to fish for the herring fish
that live in the beautiful sea
nets of silver and gold have we
said wynken blynken and nod
wynken and blynken are two little eyes
and nod is a little head
and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
is a wee ones trundle bed
now shut your eyes while mother sings
of wonderful sights that be
and you shall see the beautiful things
as you rock in the misty sea
where the old shoe
rocked the fishermen three
wynken
blynken
and nod
new pajamas god bless em
poor thing
i wish hed get that hernia fixed
george are you sleeping
i was until you started yakking
im sorry
was dennis in our bathroom
yes
i think the little rat
put mouthwash in my nasal spray
and toilet cleanser in my mouthwash
why would he do something like that
must you ask
quiet
i recited a poem for dennis tonight
that my mother used to recite to me
i remembered every word
in some tiny measure
my mother would be proud
i passed something on
its 1000 martha
dont start with the regrets
i would have been a good mother
and i would have made a swell fireman
where are you going
to make myself a cup of tea
i didnt decree
that we wouldnt have children
that was out of both our hands
this isnt about having children
or not having children
you miss the point
its about
my feeling something very good
and not being able to tell you about it
martha
i didnt mean to hurt you
im not terribly good
with feelings and emotions
there are a lot of subjects
id just as soon not bring up or discuss
i would have liked a son or a daughter
you couldnt fire the fatherly feelings
in me
because theyre not there
but that doesnt mean my feelings for you
have gone cold
thatll never happen
youve got all the love i have
remember this
je taime je tadore ma petite chérie
george
get out of here
what are you looking for now
garden lanterns
you must be pretty brave to ride
on a tiger in your underpants
put that away thats not for kids
martha
where are the gd garden lanterns
i think i better go outside and play
hello
hello martha
its alice
im still in oklahoma
oh dear
yes theres a terrible storm
my flights been cancelled
till the weather clears
i dont know whats going to happen
i know your garden partys tonight
i feel terrible
i dont know what to do
dont worry about it
you get home when you can
well be just fine here
whats george going to say
over my dead body
this is my crowning moment of retired life
and i wont throw it away like the trash
for a ninny who cant get her keister
to the airport on time
george wilson
you have no right to insult alice
she cant help the weather
any more than you or i
its just plain bad luck
its no ones fault
a tragedy of this magnitude
has to be somebodys fault
it isnt a tragedy
a little boys going to join us for a party
if you want to forsake your neighbors
when they need help do it alone
why is it when everyone else
feasts on the pleasures of life
i get the indigestion
because youre an old grump
we did a pretty good job
uhhuh
now we can order furniture
and major appliances
well dennis
your mother did not arrive

martha and i invite you

to come and clear this away
i made a mistake
mr wilson
somebody robbed your house
forty years down the drain

a menace
a selfish spoiled little boy
and i have no use for you
you took something from me
that i can never get back
something that means more to me

and i must get clean underwear
and my camera
and tell my parents to feed my fish
some sun block
and vitamins and stuff to play with
on the train so i dont get bored
put a cork in it
youre giving me a headache
i dont have a cork
shut your mouth
i cant because my nose is stuffy
because of my allergies
if i shut my mouth i cant breathe good
then keep your mouth open but dont talk
where do you put the cork
when you put a cork in it
didnt i ask you to shut your yap
whats a yap
its your mouth
i cant shut my mouth
because my nose is stuffy
shut up
i have one more question
what
what does a hostage have to do
nothing
how come you need one
in case the cops show up
do i get to use a gun
you get to stand in front of me
if the cops use a gun
ive got a slingshot
swell
im a good shot want to see
excuse me mister do you want to see
mister can you watch me for a minute
ill tell you when to look
look
your fires getting puny
when my dads fire gets puny
he wiggles it around and it gets bigger
dennis
dennis
im sorry
youre not having a very fun camping trip
nobody shoots a marble at my head
and sets my pants on fire
that was an accident
there aint going to be no more accidents
turn around
youre doing it wrong
get lost
i tied up lots of guys in my life
i bet youve never tied up a 5yearold
ill just get out
ill tie it so tight
you wont be able to move
the ropes too big and my legs are
too small to make it tight enough
theres only one way to do it
and i know because
many people have tried to tie me up
but it doesnt work
but you try your way
ill get out
and youll just have to keep doing it
what do you do differently
first you must tie up each leg by itself
then you tie them together
no matter how much i wiggle
i cant ever get out
if you really dont want me to move at all
bend down
you cant get out of that at all right
nope
you tie me up like that no matter
how much i try i cant ever get out
thanks
now let me loose
okay
get the handcuff key

i dont think
i mean you must remember back
to all the times dennis upset you
this is a new ball game
ive learned a few things
kids are kids
you have to play by their rules
if you cant do that youre in trouble
you must roll with the punches
you must expect the unexpected
arent you supposed to be
in the daycare area with the other children
thats where i was but i had to leave
the lady who watches the kids said
if she had to look at me
for five more seconds
shed jump out the window
shes a pretty nice lady
so i wouldnt want her to do that
