where they ll take you 
mine took me here 
looking back  the city and i
never much liked each other 
an unmarried woman  after all 
was expected to behave in
very particular ways 
which did not include traipsing
from publisher to publisher
with a gaggle of friends 
now  listen to me 
you must not be afraid 
and don t talk too much 
friends who  sadly  others were
not so keen to meet 
i ve been selling my drawings
for greeting cards  place cards 
etcetera for seven years 
bunnies in jackets
with brass buttons 
how ever do you imagine
such things 
i don t imagine them 
they re quite real 
they re my friends 
are you based the animal
characters on your friends 
no  the animals are my friends 
before peter rabbit there was
benjamin bunny 
and then sir isaac the newt 
i have their drawings as well 
if you d like to see them 
that won t be necessary 
unfortunately  miss potter 
it is  miss  potter  is it not 
yes  of course  silly of me 
unfortunately  the market for
children s books   
yes  of course 
i completely understand 
it was silly of me 
with no experience of these   
f  warne and company would like to
publish your little book  miss potter 
but best not to get overly hopeful 
i know publishing your book will
not sell a great number of copies 
but i think we can turn
a small profit 
my dear mr warne  well 
i m pleased  very pleased indeed 
i shall do everything possible to
ensure that you ve not made a mistake 
miss wiggin  i believe we can go 
thank you very much indeed 
messrs warne  for your time 
our pleasure  my brother always
knows what he s doing 
oh  i m quite particular about
book size and price 
and i d like to avoid that
dreadful gothic typeface
your children s books usually have 
i m sure everything will be
to your satisfaction 
miss potter 
your   
of course 
my portfolio 
come along  peter 
  sir isaac  the newt 
  you can t be serious  fruing 
  that book won t sell ten copies 
  of course not 
  however  the thought did occur to me   
  norman 
we promised our little brother
a project 
if he makes a muck of it 
what will it matter 
i think miss potter may turn out
to be a godsend 
home  miss potter 
no  saunders 
drive me through the park 
through all the parks 
  i beg your pardon  miss potter 
  drive 
walk on 
we did it 
did you hear my heart 
it was a kettle drum 
you see  we cannot stay
home all our lives 
we must present ourselves
to the world 
and we must look upon it
as an adventure 
faster  saunders 
  faster  saunders  if you please 
  no  miss beatrix  no 
  fast as you can  old boy 
  go on 
oh  i say 
saunders 
beatrix  where have you been 
it s after four o clock 
i m not a child  i can do things
without my mother s permission 
i was hoping to use the carriage
myself this afternoon 
where were you 
i took a drive 
with my friends 
you don t have any friends 
yes  i do  mother 
every time i draw 
some of your paintings are
quite pretty  beatrix 
but i m not going to deceive you
as your father does
and call them great art 
well  my friend 
when i am a published author
then we shall see 
beatrix  bertram 
time for good nights 
  i haven t finished yet

  bertram  you re barbaric 
  come on  you two 
hurry up  down you go 
slowly 
hurry  rupert  it won t do t
be late to the  hydes  
doesn t mama look beautiful 
beatrix 
being in a temper puts such
a rose into her cheeks 
when you grow up  beatrix 
and have to run a household 
plan parties  keep a social calendar
and put up with a man
who s never been introduced to a clock 
your cheeks will glow too 
look at this ribbon 
that s unsightly 
change her into something decent 
and give this nightdress away 
oh  this will never do 
i m just all fingers and thumbs 
you re impossible  rupert 
we are so late 
what have you drawn today  beatrix 
benjamin bunny having a rest 
his ears are getting
better and better 
this shading here is very good 
beatrix 
say your good nights now  children 
  good night  mother 
  good night  beatrix 
  good night  father 
  good night  beatrix 
  good night  mother 
  good night  bertram 
good night  father 
now  hurry upstairs 
  come on  mustn t make mama and papa 
  later than they are 
  oh  children 
  what now 
on my way home  i happened to
walke down piccadilly 
and what do you think
jumped into my pockets 
something very special for
the young entomologist 
and something very suitable for
the young lady
who s very soon to grow up
to run a fine home 
just like her mother 
  we ll open them upstairs  come on 
  thank you  father 
  thank you  father 
  come on 
  late  late late 
  we are not late 
we will never be invited
to the hydes  again 
heaven s sake  helen 
it s polite to be a little late 
now get in the carriage 
this isn t polite late 
this is late  late 
right  wee ones 
one story and then bed 
i want beatrix to tell a story 
hers are funny 
indeed they are  and i know exactly
what it ll be about 
tom thumb and hunker munker 
precisely  tom  hunker 
are you ready to play in a story 
oh  yes  we re excellent actors 
well  we shall see about that 
this will be your test 
over there 
once upon a time  those two excellent
housekeepers  lucinda and jane 
bought some shiny new porcelain
food which they set out
on their perfectly appointed
dining room table 
then  they decided to go for a walk 
suddenly  there came a scuffling
noise from the kitchen 
tom thumb and hunker munker crept out 
the two mice saw that
the dining table was set for dinner 
tom thumb leapt up and
took a big bite
from the first plate
and broke his tooth 
who we expecting someone 
that s my publishers 
it s not a social call 
in fact  i m rather dreading it 
i wish you wouldn t invite
trades people in to the house 
they carry dust 
well  next time 
i shall go to their office 
mr norman warne 
miss potter 
i hope you will forgive my intrusion
into your daily routine 
i was expecting one of the   
ah  yes 
i am harold and fruing s brother 
i ve recently joined the firm
and they have done me
the great honour of assigning
your book to me 
thank you  it was most gracious
of you to invite me to   
  tea 
  yes  i would love some 
yes  thank you 
lemon 
thank you 
extraordinary 
funny 
delightful and magical and
so beautifully drawn 
i am utterly  utterly speechless 
perhaps we should discuss
our business  mr warne 
i put your drawings aside with
the greatest reluctance 
your brother s letter makes
two proposals
which i find quite unacceptable 
first  they d like the drawings
to be in colour 
i m adamant they be
in black and white 
but peter rabbit s blue jacket
and the red radishes 
surely you would like your enchanting
drawings reproduced as they are 
well  of course i would prefer colour 
but colour will make the book cost
far more than little rabbits
can afford  i m adamant 
which brings us to
your brother s second point 
they wish to reduce the number
of drawings by nearly a third 
totally unacceptable 
let me explain 
the idea of reducing the number
of drawings was not my brother s
but my own 
if we can reduce the number
to 31 precisely 
then the illustrations for
the entire book could be printed
on a single sheet of paper using
what we call the three colour process 
that you desire  and at a relatively
low level of cost  yes 
i ve given your book a great deal
of attention  truly 
i would like it to look
colourful on the shelf
so that it stands out
from ordinary books 
you have given it some thought 
which other books have you
supervised  mr warne 
personally 
  yes 
  this will be my first 
miss potter  i have recently
informed my brothers and my mother
that i am no longer content to
stay at home and play nursemaid
solely because i am the youngest son 
no  i would like a proper job 
working for my family s firm
and they have assigned me you 
does that make things clearer 
in other words 
you have no experience whatsoever 
but because you ve made
a nuisance of yourself 
demanding a chance 
they ve fobbed you off on me 
miss potter  i know all too well
what my brothers intended 
giving me your  your  bunny book  
as they call it 
but i find your book quite
enchanting  delightful 
and if they intended to fob me off 
as you say  then we shall show them 
we shall give them a bunny book
to conjure with 
in colours  mixed to your
satisfaction in front of
your very eyes at the printer 
at the printer 
oh  i could never 
i will escort you there myself 
if you will allow me the the honour 
why would i never 
of course i ll go 
i m a grown woman 
miss wiggin will be there 
i see absolutely no reason why
an artist shouldn t visit her printer 
excellent  miss potter 
jolly good  thank you 
i shall make all the arrangements 
and i am  in every way 
my dear lady  at your service 
you and rabbits  extraordinary 
excuse me 
johnson  come and get
the charms  would you 
  slowly  slowly  put it there 
  i will be careful  ma am 
one  two  three    ten 
when i was ten  my mother badgered
my father into spending the summer
in the lake district 
as did other fashionable families 
like an animal released from its cage 
i fell under its spell 
mind your frocks now 
come here 
the woods are full of fairies
and little folk that look for
children that get their
clothes dirty 
and when they find them 
they send the fairy beasts at night 
with sharp teeth and a ready
appetite for young flesh 
  i m coming to get you  bea 
  no
yes 
bertram  bertram 
don t  they re farmers  children 
their hands  germs  come on 
bertram  bertram 
catch him  bea 
there he is 
oh  yes 
out of the way 
there 
there he is 
i don t think a thrashing
will be necessary 
i ll just leave the window
in the nursery unlatched tonight 
the fairy beasts will
take care of the rest 
no  i ll stay clean 
bertram 
really  beatrix  what young man
is ever going to marry a girl
with a faceful of mud 
well  i shan t marry 
so it doesn t matter 
of course you shall marry 
all girls marry  i did 
your grandmother did 
even fiona will one day 
  well  i shan t  i shall draw 
  oh  those silly drawings 
then who will love you 
my art and my animals 
i won t need more love than that 
perhaps not at 11  but let s see
if you still feel the same way at 18 
i drew mama when we first met
and she married me 
and  fiona  doesn t mud wash off 
bertram  come along 
die  you little devil 
right  prince charming himself
couldn t resist
such a bonny  wee girl 
not when he meets my brother 
vlad the impaler 
  got you 
  bedtime my young reprobates 
now  shall i leave a window
open  or 
no  i don t like fairy beasts 
well  it is a well known fact that
fairy beasts never eat a child
when he s tucked up in his own bed 
the fairies have been
in the north country
for hundreds of years 
and have had many adventures 
i told you about you
a changingly child 
no 
yes  several times 
i want to hear it 
oh  go ahead  fiona 
i ll tell myself a story 
right 
once upon a time 
there was a king and a queen 
once upon a time 
there were four little rabbits 
their names were   
flopsy  mopsy   
cotton tail and peter 
 now  my dears 
said old mrs rabbit one morning 
 you may go into the fields
or down the lane 
 but don t go into
mr mcgregor s garden  
 why not  mother  
 because your father had
an accident there 
he was put in a pie
by mrs mcgregor  
peter  who was very naughty 
ran straightaway to
mr mcgregor s garden 
and squeezed under the gate 
i like it 
but round the end of
the cucumber frame 
whom should he meet 
but mr mcgregor 
peter was out of breath and
trembling with fright 
and he had not the least idea
which way to go 
  it s muddy  actually 
  one more  mr mortimer 
lighten it up 
mr mcgregor caught sight of him
at the corner 
but peter did not care 
he slipped underneath the gate
and was safe at last
in the wood outside 
not quite  see here 
it s still a bit   
when peter came home
his mother put him to bed
with a tablespoonful of camomile tea 
but flopsy  mopsy and cotton tail
had bread and milk
and blackberries for supper 
this book  it s changed things
for me  mr warne 
how so 
for one thing  it s given me
the chance to prove to my mother
that an unmarried woman of 32 can
do more than attend tea parties
  and smile at dull conversations 
  yes  indeed 
you know  my family never wanted me
to get into publishing either 
we do make rather a good team 
don t you think 
provided  of course 
we prove them wrong 
mother  this is miss potter 
at last  we poor forgotten folk
in bedford square get to share
some of norman s excitement 
mrs warne  it s so kind of you
to invite me 
nonsense  it was the desperate
act of a woman who was beginning
to forget what her son looked like 
mother 
and this is my sister  amelia 
hello 
norman allowed us a peek at
peter rabbit  miss potter 
we found it utterly charming 
so we wheedled  cajoled 
and absolutely insisted that
norman bring you round for tea 
i have decided that you and i
are going to be friends 
have you 
well  norman tells me that
you re unmarried  as am i 
and that you re not
unhappy about it 
and i can t tell you how much
that pleases me 
why can t you talk about
the weather like other girls 
well  all the other unmarried
daughters in our circle 
and  believe me  there are many
they sit around all day 
gossiping and unaccountably
bursting into tears 
but you have done something 
you ve written a book 
i warn you  i am prepared to
like you very much 
well  in that case  i shall have
to like you too  miss warne 
call me millie  and that s to be
the last of miss potter too 
i m afraid 
absolutely  beatrix  by all means 
thank goodness  the tea 
i m beginning to feel quite ill
with all this bonhomie 
oh  do let s have tea
in the garden  mother 
it s too beautiful a day
in every way not to share it
with the flowers 
well  i love to garden 
mother disapproves 
but i can t help myself 
i love flowers shockingly 
that s why you have
the hands of a greengrocer 
i do not 
thank heavens norman sometimes
deigns to read to me 
if i had to rely on you
for companionship 
i should expire of loneliness 
my mother s taste in books 
miss potter  and  i m afraid 
in life  runs to the er   
melodramatic 
oh  nonsense 
i like good english biographies
and you know it 
i loathe silly romances  such as
the ones your brothers publish 
my brothers and i  mother 
i am part of the firm now too 
you know 
a sweet natured boy like you
does not need to work 
your brothers provide quite well
for all of us 
and i need your smile here 
but then  no one listens to
a crotchety old lady
in a wheelchair 
indeed they don t  mother 
my mother may be crotchety 
miss potter 
but she does have an eye
for beautiful things 
she was fascinated by your drawings 
utterly unique 
well  when i see something unusual 
i m not content just to look at it 
i must capture it 
last summer  in the farmyard 
i was drawing something
that was quite lovely in the sun 
and suddenly  i realised i was
drawing the pigs  swill bucket 
i had to laugh at myself 
i feel a bit of a chill  norman 
can you take me inside 
  of course 
  please excuse me 
it was delightful meeting you 
miss potter 
and you 
do stay longer  and teach
millie how to behave 
i think that means she likes you 
did she say she likes to
draw swill buckets 
indeed she did  mother 
indeed she did 
i think by wednesday  you could
hang the lace curtains upstairs 
  then at least it will look like summer 
even if it doesn t feel like it   yes  madam
oh  beatrix  what is this stain
on your blouse 
jane says it won t wash out 
and she s tried everything 
  oh  it s ink 
  ink 
i must have brushed against
something at the printers  
jane  i m very sorry for causing
you extra work 
jane  take the blouse away 
give it to the poor 
this behaviour shows scant
regard for your father s money 
well  one day  i shall make enough
money to buy my own clothes 
i m far too old to be living off
the generosity of my father 
you re too old to be
spending so much time
in the company of a man
who takes you to printers 
your father does not approve 
and neither do i 
mr warne is publishing my book 
oh  that book  i can hardly wait
till it s finished and forgotten 
i don t understand you  beatrix 
your father and i have introduced
you to so many suitable young men
of your class  young men of fortune 
and impeccably good family 
oh  certainly  like that charming
fellow  lionel stokely 
lionel is a particular favourite
of his uncle  the earl 
whom we visit every summer
at stokely court 
oh  and i do regret terribly that
i didn t accept harry haddon bell 
harry s great grandfather
went to sandhurst 
harry s grandfather
went to sandhurst 
harry s father
went to sandhurst 
and so i went to sandhurst 
father and i and the gamekeeper often
go out riding in the morning   
ashton s a crack shot 
but no  you re just
a pig headed girl 
mr warne is asking for you
at the door  miss 
mr warne  he s not expected 
unannounced  perfection 
come on  here 
two sold while we were
at the booksellers 
that amounts to 40 in a week 
  which is 160 in a month 
  good gracious 
i m trying to remember
my twelve times table 
1 920 in a year 
  i can t breathe 
  that s just in one shop 
my dear miss potter 
you are an author 
we have achieved
what we set out to do 
we have created a book 
yes 
what s the matter 
a cloud just passed across your face 
you ve been very generous
with your time  mr warne 
shown me things that
i never would have seen 
printing houses 
  i shall miss your company 
  are you losing my company 
it just occurred to me
that the book is out
and our association is
coming to an end 
miss potter 
i had hoped that you might
have other stories 
really 
really 
do you know  i recently remembered
one i thought i had forgotten it 
about a duck   
a very stupid duck 
based on one of your friends 
it s based on myself  i think
it s a story i told a friend once 
my family summers in the lake district 
and there was someone there 
the grounds man s son  who was
always interested in my stories 
miss beatrix  are you skulking 
no such thing  willie heelis  no 
i was drying off my sketch book 
not bad  miss beatrix 
do you have any animal
stories for me today 
i don t  sorry  nothing new 
that s jemima 
she doesn t have a story yet 
not a proper one 
  jemima duck 
  jemima puddle duck 
and a stupider duck
the world has never seen 
she goes looking for a safe
place to lay her eggs
and meets a charming gentleman
with a long bushy tail
and very sharp teeth 
precisely 
the gentlemen offers her his shed
and jemima is surprised to find
that there are so many feathers in it 
but then  as i told you 
she is a very stupid duck 
i like it 
i d love to paint every view
in this valley 
but i m not very good at landscapes 
wait too long and it won t be
here to paint  miss beatrix 
  really  that s ridiculous 
  no  i m serious 
the large farms are being broken up
into small plots and sold off 
well  you can t stand
in the way of progress 
so they say 
but i say beauty s
worth preserving 
i know you do  willie 
but nobody could disagree
with you about that 
well  i ll see you soon  then 
perhaps not  miss beatrix 
i m leaving for manchester next week 
to study the law 
yes  indeed  i have to better
myself somehow 
  good luck 
  send me some drawings 
i will 
he encouraged me to take
my writing seriously 
we must get started on
the new story straight away 
jemima puddle duck 
i think the public should like that 
and tom thumb and hunker munker 
what do you think 
well  if you  if you think 
your book has been very
important in my life 
you have been very
important in my life 
and you in mine  mr warne 
  and we must do it again and again 
  and again 
i promise you 
i intend to be a nuisance 
when did you decide
you wouldn t marry 
just before my 20th birthday 
mother came to my room and
announced that lionel stokely
was to marry gwendolyn alcott and
they were to live at stokely court 
which lionel had just
inherited from the earl 
and i knew right then that
she would bring me no more suitors
and that i would never marry 
and that shocked me 
but i felt relieved 
and that shocked me 
so i went into the garden and filled
an entire notebook with sketches 
men are bores 
they re useful for only
two things in life
financial support and procreation 
millie 
you say outrageous things 
  ah  but the price 
  what price 
domestic enslavement 
childbirth  terrifying 
no  unmarried women have
a better life 
i swear it s true 
no houses  no babies  no husbands
demanding things all the time 
as long as one s lucky enough
in life to have a good friend 
i m so glad norman found you  beatrix 
i was missing something
i didn t even know 
dear miss potter 
i enclose with great pleasure
the latest in what i hope
will be a long line of tales 
yours affably  norman warne 
mr warne 
would you and millie like to
come to a christmas party 
my parents hold one every year 
and i think it s high time
that i invited someone 
yes  we d be delighted to attend 
thrilled  in fact 
be still  little imps 
peter  you naughty boy 
look what an example you re setting 
that s better  any more of that
and i ll paint you out 
your father is home 
how was your day at the club  father 
interesting  as always 
rupert  we seem to have a situation 
we need your resolution 
i want to invite norman warne and
his sister to our christmas party 
with lady armitage 
with sir nigel and sybil 
a tradesman  rupert 
how will anyone have fun 
he s the gentleman
who publishes my books  father 
  rupert 
  i have something here  beatrix 
i went into hatchards bookshop and
i purchased this with good money 
hugh whitteford bearded me in
the club and rattled on for hours 
you know old hugh  jowls all aflutter 
wife s bought three of
your girls  books
for her granddaughter s nursery 
sending more by ship
to chums in bombay 
very soon  the whole club was
telling me of some purchase
that they had made of
our daughter s creation 
so i thought it was time
that i bought one 
so i went straight into hatchards 
put my shilling onto the counter 
i would have given you one 
but i wanted to buy one
like everyone else 
now  i owe you an apology  beatrix 
when you showed me your books 
all i saw was my little girl
bringing me clever drawings
for me to comment on 
you re not a little girl anymore 
you re an artist 
the genuine article 
i would have been proud to use
that word about myself 
and now  i m proud of you  beatrix 
thank you  father 
so i don t see any reason why
we cannot make a little social effort
to welcome the gentleman responsible
for this blessing into our home 
thank you  father 
thank you 
i think it will be good
for all of us 
merry christmas  rupert 
glenys  don t serve sir nigel
the punch with brandy
  unless he demands it 
  yes  madam 
and after dinner  he ll take port 
come and give me a little signal
after he s had four glasses 
the house shimmers  my darling 
you ve done it again 
  good evening  sir 
  good evening 
  mr warne  millie 
  how wonderful 
thank you  jane 
thank you  thank you 
mother  father 
i would like you to meet
miss amelia and mr norman warne 
how charming of you
to be so punctual 
go on  one wouldn t hurt 
i think wiggin is under strict
orders never to leave our side 
how festive 
such scintillating conversation 
oh  mine as well  the weather
in amsterdam in july 
could i interest you ladies
in an after dinner coffee 
some of the gentlemen would like
to play a few hands of cards 
but they re short of a fourth 
i don t suppose you play whist 
mr warne 
i m afraid i ve never had
much aptitude for cards 
  oh  that is a pity 
  i play 
this is to play with sir nigel 
miss warne 
sir nigel takes his whist
very seriously 
i play rather well  actually 
do you  millie 
well  i m sure you two have
plenty to talk about without me 
and if they can t play
without a fourth   
come along  miss warne 
carols in the music room  my dears 
perhaps i could show you
your christmas present 
yes 
it s upstairs 
i will bring the coffee 
  mrs wiggin 
  miss 
miss wiggin  i have taken
the liberty of adding
a splash of brandy to our coffees 
well  it is christmas 
is this where you paint  miss potter 
yes  and it s where we shall
find your christmas present 
oh  my 
i think  other than bertram and father 
you are the first man ever
to set foot in this room 
  would you like me to leave 
  no  no  no  wiggin is here 
and if this is the best i can do
for scandal at my age 
i m hardly worthy of my reputation
for creativity 
here 
my  but it s beautiful 
is it the new story 
miss potter  is it the new story 
  is it 
  i m not going to tell you 
come over here 
that s jemima puddle duck 
it s the first drawing i ever did
of jemima  i was eight  i think 
jemima  stop that 
stop what 
just some silliness 
  and what s this 
  oh  it s a music box 
my father gave it to me
for my sixth birthday 
he did the painting himself 
so your father is an artist too 
no  he always wanted to be an artist 
but the family disapproved 
so  he took up law 
the joke is i ve never once
heard him discuss a case 
he goes to his club every day 
and never his office 
so  i don t really know
what he does 
  oh  dear 
  wiggin is fallible 
i m afraid  miss potter  your
reputation is now officially dented 
 let me teach you how to dance  
do you dance  miss potter 
no  well  not well 
i make a terrible hash of it too
when i try 
but the words are very sweet 
you know the words 
will you sing the words 
well  er   
 let me teach you how to dance
 let me lead you to the floor
 simply place your hand in mine
 and then think of nothing more 
 let the music cast its spell
 give the atmosphere a chance 
 simply follow where i lead
 let me teach you how to dance 
miss potter 
i know you have decided not to marry 
all my life  i thought that
i would not marry either
but something has happened that
has caused me to change my mind 
no  please  let me go on 
for if i do not say
what i have to say it now 
i fear i never will 
miss potter 
i would like you to consider   
mr warne 
doing me the honour  and i do not
expect an immediate answer 
beatrix 
i was just showing mr warne
his christmas present 
i m an impeccably genteel 
unmarried lady  mother 
i haven t begun to invite
men to my room 
mr warne 
wiggin 
what is the picture  beatrix 
i ve written and drawn
little children s books 
which have been published 
the man who published them is here 
mr norman warne 
to thank him for his assistance
and generosity   
well    i m   
i m writing him a christmas story 
  can we hear it 
  it isn t finished  so   
oh  go on 
i suppose  before we part
for the evening 
i could share a glimpse of
the unfinished tale of
 the rabbits  christmas party  
one particularly snowy christmas eve 
a young rabbit and
his fearsome older brothers
and fiercely brave sister
set out on a journey they make
every year to celebrate
with their friends 
now  rabbits are highly sociable
creatures  and legend has it that
wherever they find themselves
on christmas eve 
they get together and
throw a jolly party 
now  i know such a legend exists
because i made it up 
the rabbits travel through
the woods to the well appointed
burrow of their cousins where
a warm fire is waiting for them 
they take off their frosty coats
and the party begins 
now  i know on this night
that they will eat and talk
and dance and laugh and
roast apples on the fire 
but i m not certain
how the story ends 
because i haven t made
that part up yet 
but  in any case  mr warne will
have to read it first 
as he is my strict censor 
and  well  it is his present 
merry christmas  mr warne 
thank you  miss potter 
it s so beautiful 
there ll be no problem with presents
for the grandchildren next year 
  i dare say 
  you must be very proud  helen 
it s just a children s story 
outstanding 
  can i talk to you 
  of course 
what is it 
is there something wrong 
no  as my confidante 
you have something to confide 
how delicious 
your brother has asked me
to marry him 
and i feel  quite irrationally 
that i may say   yes  
i d like your approval 
my approval 
beatrix  don t be a fool 
marry him 
tomorrow  don t waste a moment 
how could you hesitate 
you re not upset 
well  why would i be upset 
well  both norman and i 
you ll be alone 
you have a chance for happiness 
and you re worrying about me 
i wouldn t worry about you if 
if someone came along
who loved me and whom i loved 
i would trample my mother 
  do you love norman 
  yes 
then marry him  don t you dare
think about anyone else 
but what about all
the blessings of being alone 
hogwash 
what else is a woman on her own
supposed to say 
you have a chance to be loved 
take it 
and leave me happy 
knowing that the two people
that i love are happy 
that is the most thought
you should ever have for me 
there you are  beatrix 
the guests 
yes  mother 
millie   
go 
what is going on tonight 
why do i feel like a stranger
in my own home 
you have a clever daughter  rupert 
you must be very proud 
  of beatrix  yes  we are 
  to write and draw like that 
beatrix should meet my niece  anne 
she makes pots 
  ceramics  nigel 
  look like pots to me 
as for you  madam 
i suggest you take up knitting 
merry christmas 
what was all that about 
sir nigel disapproves of the way
i play whist 
i m afraid i won two guineas from him 
mr warne 
  your painting 
  oh  yes  my christmas present 
yes 
  goodbye  mr warne 
  goodbye  mr warne 
sir 
i have an appointment to see
mr rupert potter in the eagleton room 
  he s expecting you  sir 
  thank you 
come along  norman 
it s only her father 
come in 
thank you very much  mr potter 
for taking the time
out of your very busy day 
goodbye  mr warne 
if you will not accept our advice
in this decision 
then we will have to impose
that advice 
respect our knowledge and
the worth of our opinions  beatrix 
oi  get over there 
i said that i ll do it and i will 
norman warne is a tradesman  beatrix 
no potter can marry into trade 
  and that s final 
  and what are we 
father s money comes from
grandfather s printing works
in lancashire 
a trade  mother 
and if grandfather hadn t
run for parliament 
we d still be living
in the shadow of his factories 
your legacy came from grandfather
leech s cotton trade 
when did we become
so high and mighty 
we re parvenus  mother 
social climbers 
your father and i we will not
allow this marriage for your own good 
and there is no reason to
become insulting 
it s not an insult 
it s the truth 
our lives are pretension and
social aspiration 
sir this and lady that 
norman warne is a gentleman
of comfortable means 
and not one bit beneath us 
and i intend to marry him 
not if you expect to take
one penny of your inheritance 
you haven t disinherited bertram
for running off
with a wine merchant s daughter 
happily  i am a published author 
i have means of my own 
this discussion is over 
come in  father 
why is it that after any difficult
situation  she always sends you 
mama didn t send me 
i don t like tension in my home 
i want to resolve this matter 
well  you can t 
i ve made my decision 
your mother wants what is
best for you  as do i  beatrix 
an impulsive and inappropriate
marriage is something that
you would ultimately regret 
you can t allow me to
marry and leave 
with bertram moved away 
who would take care of you 
you surely do not think
we would deny you happiness
just simply because we needed
a nursemaid 
that is a knife in my heart 
well  then  what is it  father 
because i cannot understand 
you cannot make us the villains 
beatrix 
your mother trotted out countless
suitors all of them acceptable 
  you rejected every one of them 
  i know that  father 
i didn t want to be a silly woman
marrying a man simply
because he was acceptable 
or rich enough to take care of me 
but does that mean that
i m never to be loved 
father 
wiggin  wait here  please 
i d like to enquire about my
royalty earnings  mr copperthwaite 
and whether i might  at some stage 
afford a house of my own
in the country 
you have enough to buy an estate 
several estates  and a house in town 
you re quite a wealthy woman 
miss potter 
am i truly 
yes  the income has become
quite regular 
if your fortune continues to grow 
you should have no financial worries
for the rest of your life 
extraordinary 
beatrix 
beatrix  come and sit with us 
please 
  i d rather not  father 
  we have something to discuss 
a proposition 
and  for heaven s sake  beatrix 
let the servants carry your dishes 
  tea 
  no  thank you 
nonsense  you always take tea 
contrary to what you think and
what you have so vehemently
expressed  your mama and i
want you to be happy 
we simply doubt that
this marriage will do the trick 
helen  please 
sit down  beatrix 
what we don t want is for you
to rush into something
which you may later wish
to reconsider 
i won t want to reconsider 
  we are not convinced 
  helen  please 
we are not convinced 
yet  neither have we hearts of stone 
therefore  this is what we propose 
you may accept mr  warne 
but it must remain a complete
secret even from his own family 
now  this summer  yourself 
mama and i will go 
as always  to the lake district 
if  at the end of the summer 
you still wish to proceed 
then we will announce
your engagement
and you can marry with
our blessing and our love 
why must no one know 
so there ll be no public
embarrassment when you change 
  if  if you change your mind 
  if 
now  beatrix  if you care for
this man as much as you say you do 
then in a few months the ardour
will still be there 
if your mother  and i  are correct 
and this emotion cools with time 
then we will have protected you
against humiliation and unhappiness 
  it will not cool 
  beatrix  listen to me 
a woman at your age must
consider very carefully   
mother  the only thing true
at my age is that at my age 
every day matters 
very well  mother  father 
i accept your terms 
norman and i may decide to
wait in any case 
but make plans 
there will be a wedding
in this house by october 
they re beautiful 
which carriage  rupert 
saunders 
four carriages down 
this way 
well   
  this is the potters  for windermere 
  right you are  sir 
here and those two 
beatrix 
mr  warne 
oh  i do apologise 
  miss potter 
  mr  warne 
i was beginning to fear
you wouldn t come 
you re soaked 
it wasn t raining
when i left the office 
i brought you the proof of
the new book for your trip 
  oh  you ll catch cold 
  i couldn t miss seeing you off 
you know nothing would stop me 
this is going to be the longest
summer i ve ever spent 
  it s only the summer  that s all 
  yes 
and this time is not for us 
it s for your parents 
how can they know what we re feeling 
they ve never felt it 
we can afford them
this three months 
i suppose 
this is not how i wish
to say goodbye to you 
goodbye  miss potter 
i look forward to your speedy return 
as do i  mr  warne 
quickly  here 
goodbye  miss potter 
goodbye  mr  warne 
goodbye  norman 
my dear  dear norman 
this absurd forced separation
is surely a kind of madness 
most notably  that of my mother 
but you are here  my dear  for me 
the beauty of this place seems
magnified somehow 
with you in my mind 
in my occasional lonely moments 
i imagine conversations between us 
and yesterday startled a duck with
my declaration of love for you 
all of my thoughts are with you 
my darling 
i know that you find harold
and fruing terribly boring 
but  in fact  i m having
what i could almost describe
as wild enjoyment working
with them 
you may wake up  one day 
to find yourself married
to a businessman 
praise the day when i can wake up
to find you beside me 
i took one of the boats out
onto the lake at sunset
to watch the water hens feeding 
they made noises like kissing 
i closed my eyes and pictured you 
i find i love my heart more now 
because that is where i know
i can find you 
amelia sends her fond love and
wishes for us all
to be together again 
as do i  multiplied a hundredfold 
sir    hill top farm 
may i ask 
is it a working farm 
aye  another great one falls 
but this one breaks your heart 
really  why 
now  miss  a body would have to
be a poet  which i certainly am not 
excuse me  but i d swear you
were someone i once knew 
good heavens  willie heelis 
miss beatrix  miss potter 
  is that you 
  how good to see you 
well  hello 
i see you ve given up on the law 
have you decided to make
an honest living 
ah  yes  the law 
well  not exactly  no  no 
a country solicitor needs to
be proficient in many skills 
and it suits me to be out of
the office now and again 
now  i could show you hill top 
if you have the time 
yes  yes 
time is exactly what i have 
good 
  not a bad outlook  miss potter 
  it s sublime 
by chance  i met an old friend
today who showed me
a beautiful farm that s for sale 
it would be a perfect country home 
and though i know we ll live
mainly in the city
i m very keen to share
my favourite places with you 
the post has arrived and  once again 
no letter from your mr  warne 
is it time for me to start getting
just a little hopeful 
he did mention he might take
a few days  holiday 
the post is no doubt slow
from wherever he s gone 
indeed 
but there is something that
appears to be from
that interesting sister of his 
millie  how delightful 
excuse me 
norman is ill 
  i m beatrix potter 
  please come in  miss 
  ah  miss potter 
  hello 
  please  come in 
  thank you 
  i came as soon as i heard 
  yes  it s very kind of you 
very  very kind indeed 
how is he 
beatrix 
millie 
millie 
i m too late 
he was so happy 
he sang songs 
he made me dance with him
in the parlour 
he laughed all the time 
everyone noticed the change in him 
only i knew the reason 
but all summer  he had a cough 
and then the cough got worse 
and in one night  he was gone 
it was so sudden  i keep thinking
that it hasn t happened 
i keep expecting to see him
in the garden 
when s the funeral 
it was yesterday 
it was only the immediate family 
and i   
well  i couldn t think of a reason
to ask them to delay it for you 
it was considerate of you to come
and pay your respects  miss potter 
our mother is particularly moved 
and is sorry she isn t well enough
to come down to greet you 
i ll be taking over our late brother s
business affairs  miss potter 
fine 
i want to assure you that f warne
and company will do everything
in its power to ensure that
our tragic loss causes you
the least possible inconvenience 
please accept the gratitude
of the entire family 
  they want me to go 
  i m sorry 
miss beatrix 
what are you doing in london 
  is something wrong 
  a friend died 
i m sorry  miss 
was she a close friend 
miss beatrix 
miss beatrix 
i ll leave your dinner outside
the door  then  miss 
saunders is here  miss potter 
to take you to the station 
i shan t be going back to the lakes 
can i get you anything  then 
nothing  hilda 
very well  miss potter 
beatrix  it s millie 
look  i know i m unannounced 
but they sent back all my messages 
please  please  please  let me in 
we ve got to get you out of here 
come on  come on 
let s get you washed and dressed
and out of this room 
go and find something to wear 
i can t 
millie 
i can t 
i ve been torturing myself 
i should never have encouraged
you with norman 
i d have saved you all
this terrible grief 
i loved him 
i loved him too 
but he s gone 
i must leave this house 
i will leave this house 
congratulations  miss potter 
you are now the proud owner
of hill top farm 
thank you  george 
well  i m sure you ll be
very happy at hill top 
i spent some time there
as a child 
is that so  i did have other
plans for it  but   
i m sure that i will love it
in any case 
yes  if you need any other
assistance or help   
thank you very much  mr heelis 
good day 
good day  miss potter 
what i don t understand  beatrix 
is how you re going to pay
for this farm 
i m a writer  mother 
people buy my work 
our daughter is famous  helen 
you are the only person
who doesn t know it 
what i don t understand is
why you find it necessary
to leave your home 
it is not a choice  father 
beatrix  if i could undo anything   
there s nothing to undo 
this has nothing to do
with you or mother 
i must make my own way 
so you must 
so you must 
everybody out 
you see 
i told you we could not know
where our journey would lead 
it has led us here 
this is your new home 
no tears 
miss 
millie 
it s wonderful to see you 
oh  this place is perfect 
millie 
what have you brought 
i thought it best not to
bring this  but then   
it jumped into my hand
as i walked out the door 
i m sorry 
thank you 
it s getting easier 
  it s getting etasier for me too 
  good
i m painting again 
my mind s going mad with the story 
i ve got pigs running amuck up there 
well  it s this place  isn t it 
who d want to be cooped up in london
when they could be up here 
  i m so glad you came 
  me too 
i ve been so lucky with visitors 
first  my brother bertram 
then my mother 
you think that s lucky 
your mother is a monster 
no  its fine  my mother and i have
come to an understanding 
we ve agreed to not
understand each other 
look  if some city slicker wants to
offer me a half decent price
for a derelict property and then
pay me and my lads good money
to knock the damn place down 
let him build what he likes 
if we allow these city developers
to buy up our land 
there ll be no more farming 
and all you re left with is
a ruined landscape and no community 
miss potter 
ah  mr heelis 
i see you ve found me 
i played here so often as a child 
i know your farm very well 
i swam in the stream 
played hide and seek in the woods
with cousin charles 
i brought you the executed deed
for the farm 
at last 
thank you very much  mr heelis 
  busy 
  yes 
yes  i ve asked mr canon to stay on
and run hill top as a working farm 
i m learning a great deal 
i wish everyone who bought
land up here could be so   
enlightened 
you ve bought a farm 
you ve kept the workers on 
you re working the land and
you re preserving this place 
yes  it makes me happy 
mr cannon says the two farms
adjoining mine are for sale 
i d hate to see the developers
get hold of them 
do you know anything about them 
  morning  mr canon 
  miss potter 
my  they ve grown 
  handsome lot  wouldn t you say 
  yes 
have you named them 
we don t often give them names 
miss potter 
makes it a bit hard 
come slaughtering time 
hello  miss potter 
hello yourself  mr heelis 
to what do i owe this pleasure 
i ve come with a message 
mr hubbard is ill
and will be unable to show you
the neighbouring farms today 
  oh  dear  it s not serious  i hope 
  chronic illness  i m afraid 
recurs several times a month 
usually after a night
at the rose and crown 
i see 
mr hubbard wondered if i might
show you the properties instead 
i d be pleased to have
so knowledgeable a guide 
i ll just get my shawl 
well  it s prime land 
there s a lot of profit
in building houses on it 
but more value as
a working farm  surely 
spoken like a true
lakes woman  miss potter 
indeed  mr heelis 
you do realise i ve never
been to an auction 
it s simple enough 
don t bid too early and
stick to your limit 
i know my limit  mr heelis 
craven s mill farm 
40 acres of splendour 
  1 100 anywhere 
  1 100 i m bid 
  1 150 
come along  gentlemen 
splendid little farm  this 
lots of development potential 
  1 150 
  1 200 anywhere 
  1 200 
  1 300 anywhere 
bidding  madam 
  1 300 
seated at   1 300 
  1 400 
  1 500 
  1 600 
seven hundred 
eight hundred 
  1 900 
at   1 900 
  2 000 at the back    2 000
any more at   2 000 
  2 300 
  rich bastard 
  thank you  sir    2 300 
at   2 300 
any more  then  at   2 300 
  2 500 
the lady at   2 500 
against you  sir 
at   2 500    2 800 
miss potter  you ve bid more
than that farm is worth 
 3 000  at  3 000 seated 
with the lady  against you  sir 
are we all done at  3 000 
going once 
going twice 
sold to the lady   3 000 
sir  you should control your client 
she has allowed her emotions
to get the better of her 
really 
she has squandered any possibility
of profit from that farm 
it was prime development land 
this place  this community
is an inspiration 
it should be conserved for
future generations 
and not destroyed 
it deserves protection 
madam  your observations are
woefully inadequate   
please  sir  i am no longer
in the habit of being lectured to 
and  thankfully  i do not require
your approval or anyone else s 
so  if you ll excuse us 
mr heelis 
i hope you re not going to make
a habit of this  miss potter 
do you know  mr heelis 
i think i might 
now  will you have time tomorrow
to show me those other farms 
  i certainly will 
  excellent 
come in 
oh  my 
goodness me 
i ll be just a moment 
now then young man  how are you
taking to your new home 
i know it s not london 
but hill top might suit
a young rabbit better 
he seems to be taking
to the place 
as am i  mr heelis 
  now  the road 
  oh  yes 
yes  of course  miss potter 
how would you feel about
calling me william
instead of this infernal mr heelis 
i sound like an undertaker 
of course  william 
and i believe beatrix might be
perfectly appropriate as well 
there s something delicious about
