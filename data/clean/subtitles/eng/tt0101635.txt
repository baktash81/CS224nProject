you re entitled to half
of everything he has 
l m not married 
so l don t know what it s like   
to face the conclusion
of a decades old relationship 
and l don t have children  so l can t say   
how the final disposition of the offspring
would impact me emotionally 
but l can say this much 
you have it within your means
to grind your husband into the ground 
l don t know if l want to go quite that far 
mrs  arnold  you came to me
because you wanted financial protection 
lf you want sympathy 
you won t get it here 
you won t get emotion from me 
l m not an emotional person 
what does grinding him
into the ground involve 
going for his weakest spot 
he s a public man  a politician 
 you threaten his image 
 how 
we immediately begin documenting
his sexual improprieties 
that s awfully personal 
table for two  please 
nonsmoking 
by the window  if you have it 
tesio 
tesio  go and notify albert
that we have a situation 
l have no tables  they re all reserved 
are you familiar with the city ordinance   
title 2  chapter 160  section 010 
  all persons shall have equal access
to public services    and so forth and so on 
ln short  l have every right
to be in this restaurant 
not so long as that restaurant
has a dress code   
 and that dress code requires a tie  
 tie  right here 
well  l guess it s time for me
to be moving on  thank you very much  
l don t need the help  lt s not necessary 
no  no 
why don t you pick on someone
your own size  you big  ugly chump 
mrs  arnold dropped by
to say hello on her way out 
she looked like she d seen a ghost 
what did you do 
told her what her options are 
l don t think she wants
to destroy her husband   
and l don t want this firm being known
for ruining frank arnold 
don t tell me how to do my work 
go easy on this divorce 
or l ll put another attorney on it 
who are you trying to protect 
a law firm  a wife  kids    
things you know nothing about  grey 
and l feel sorry for you 
 well  don t lose too much sleep 
 hey  lighten up 
you keep going at 190 miles an hour 
you re going to hit something 
all right  take this stick   
and l want you to crack me
right on the top of the head  all right 
forget it 
honey  you have to do it 
lt s not going to hurt me  l swear 
we talked about this
all the way from detroit 
yeah  but that was talking 
talking is different than doing 
right  and if it wasn t  we could
talk our way into a million dollars   
and a nice high rise penthouse 
we have to do the doing 
not the talking  come on 
 you re going to cry 
 have you ever seen me cry  honey

we ve got things to do  all right 
now  however much you love me   
that s how hard you hit me  okay

there 
l almost had that lady s purse 
but you blew it 
 l had it right in my hand 
 tough  we don t steal 
but we cheat 
 a little  but we don t steal 
 we lie 
a little more than we cheat 
but that s not right  either 
lt s because of the times 
right  we don t steal 
and we don t break any laws 
 some laws we do 
 not the good ones

you should be praying for to be your mom 
why  who needs a mom 
you don t have a mom 
and you came out all right 
grab some napkins
and use the washroom 
okay

now get out of here  before l call the cops 
thanks  you jerk 
 l m sorry about your ring  honey

l ll get you another one 
that would make me feel nervous 
why would a ring make you nervous 
when someone gives you something
to remember them by  it means they ll go 
lf they re going to stay  you don t need
anything  because they ll be there 
you worry too much 
tell me about the frank arnold divorce 
lt sounds wonderfully filthy and sick 
you know l can t tell you anything 
so why do you ask 
he s incredibly corrupt 
what if you need a favor sometime 
with the material l m gathering 
l ll get favors for the rest of my life 
like what kind of material  photos 
let s change the subject 
something s wrong 
something s bothering you 
l can t stop thinking
about what happened last night 
what s there to think about 
lt happened  lt s over 
you ll never see those people again 
 hello 
 walker

look  after we finish here   
l need to check into a job   
and then we ll go to the art museum

 will it hurt you to learn a thing or two 
all you learn from the art museum
is how to keep your mouth shut   
and how to walk
without making your shoes squeak 
all right  then l ll put you in school 
 no  welfare people would take me away 
 not if l have a job and a nice place to live 
you haven t got legal custody  we d get
caught and cops will throw you in jail 
ls that a nice thing to say 
we wouldn t even be talking about this
if you d got money out of that lady 
we d be on the road 
you didn t because she was too pretty 
 she was too smart 
 and she was too pretty 
 she was in a hurry 
 and she was too pretty 
 she was going to catch onto us 
 and she was too pretty 
you re pretty  and l don t leave you alone 
she was too pretty 
all right  if l say she was too pretty 
will you put a cork in it 
promise 
she was too pretty 
l knew it 
hubba hubba 
grey

slow down  my legs are moving so fast

mrs  arnold called  she sounded pissed 
she needs to see you tomorrow 
so l told her 2 30 pm  okay 
fine 
walker called  he has a dinner meeting
and probably won t come over 
but if you need to have sex 
that s what he said   
go ahead over to his place
after your dinner 
call him and decline 
 mr  oxbar  
 l really have to go 
 we ain t beggars  right 
 right 
then what s the point
of going to find that lady again 
 are you hungry 
 not much 
well  l am  there s no harm in showing
our face around her again   
to see if she ll offer another meal 
that s begging 
no  begging is asking in a pathetic fashion 
you re splitting hairs  bill 
hell  l d rather sing for my supper
than sit in a parking lot 
they stink to all holy heaven 
look  we re going to wait in the garage   
we ll look like we re doing some business 
and if she comes out   
if she feels kind  we ll take her kindness 
 and if she doesn t come out  
 we freeze our nuts off 
you don t have any nuts
to freeze off  honey 
come on  baby  what s the matter 
this is the place  let s go 
my lips are chapped
and l have to find my lip grease 
women 
now you ve really killed him 
there are no broken bones 
no contusions  no abrasions 
a few lesions  not of your doing 
that wound on his forehead
is a day or two old 
l did that yesterday 
you hit him twice 
what he needs is soap   
a razor  a good meal  bed rest   
and then a good swift kick in the behind 
you re crazy to let a person like that
stay in your house 
the little girl is his daughter 
she could use a little soap  too 
this is a matter for the city   
not a single woman living alone 
l m sure it looks worse than it is 
l appreciate your concern  but it s okay 
sorry  l fell asleep 
seeing as how l was so extremely tired 
you ll get to go to sleep
in just a minute  okay 
 thank you for coming up 
 don t be silly 
this is the stuff
of 10 00 news lead stories   
but you re over 21  
l ll sleep with my door locked 
l m in the building  l can be here
in two seconds if you need me 
 thanks 
 good night  dear 
this is very excellent 
l never knew pizza was so good
when it was hot

l think bill s better off resting 
his whole life is nothing
but a thousand miles of bad road 
the doctor said he s going to be fine 
don t tell bill he saw a doctor 
lt s against his faith 
oh  no  that s his
afraid to die alone groan 
you keep eating

l d like you to at least stay the night

 not really 
 l m surprised 
 why 
because you re a saint 
there are fresh towels in the bathroom 
l ll see that your daughter gets to bed 
thank you 
l have the apartment wired for security 
there s a man downstairs 
l need only touch a button 
l don t mean to be harsh or unkind   
but l don t know you 
and you re in my home 
now  if you have any dishonest inklings 
l caution you that l m no fool 
l understand  ma am

good night

how many people live here

they re mine 
 how come your bed s so huge 
 l like a big bed 
you got an awful lot of pillow
for just one person 
well    
how come you have so many tvs 
l must have seen three already 
how s this 
lt won t be the most beautiful outfit

ma am  you re so nice 
my name is grey 
 mrs  grey

 cause you got all that beautiful curly hair

lt s because this guy we wintered with 
tampa joe reilly

the big oaf in the three stooges 
he said it so much that it stuck  see ya 
how come you don t have any kids 
you have plenty of dough for lots of them 
lt would be hard for me to have children 
l m not married 
kids don t come from weddings 
you know 
 they come from right down  
 no  l know 
the proper way to have a family
is to start with a wedding  isn t it 
well  unless you have a baby first 
l want to have seven babies 
l m naming them monday  tuesday 
wednesday  thursday  friday   
saturday  and bill  after bill

l was ripped from my sleep
by a screaming child

l told you last night you were itching for it

the boobs  the kissing 
the babies  the crabby time   
the not wearing lipstick till you re 16   
the underwear bank robbers wear

 good morning 
bernie  what a pleasant surprise 
did we have a meeting 
l ve stopped trying to fix meetings  grey 
you re never in 
that s not true 
obviously something is bothering you 
what are you doing 
every time l ve called the last few days 
you re not in 
l ve had personal business to attend to 
l don t know if personal business   
or the time it s taken from work
has anything to do with it   
but you ve got this arnold divorce
all screwed up 
nothing s screwed up 
l told her to return to her husband 
 she did 
 what s the problem 
he wanted her out 
that s why l told you to go easy 
he wanted out 
but not to give up everything 
l guess it s his tough luck 
do you have photographs of frank arnold 
 l ll say 
 destroy them 
no 
not if he s going to screw her
out of what she s entitled to 
destroy them  no opposition on this 
he wants the grounds  he wants the kids 
and try spending a little more time
in the office 
are you susan dancer 
hiya  pigeon 
you re looking sharp 
l can t talk 
where s the ring 
tell me where the ring is 
l pawned it  ogden and madison 
this situation is totally unnecessary 
l m an attorney 
the child was in my care  in my home 
her needs were being met 
there was no reason to take her away 
ma am  you aren t a legal guardian 
she can t possibly understand
what s happening to her 
she s in protective custody 
she s being properly cared for 
ln 48 hours  a shelter care hearing
will be called in juvenile court 
you re welcome to attend 
l love this little girl 
lt s understandable  but   
from my position 
it s completely irrelevant 
yo  dancer  you re out of here 
your lawyer just posted bond for you 
you got a cute lawyer  too 
did you ever get those
plantar s warts taken care of  
my aunt bernice had hers cut out 
 frank arnold 
 pumpkin  l m on the phone 
you know  they re so sensitive 
aunt bernice had those 
the schnauzer stepped on her 
l thought she d go through the ceiling 
ls he in  yes or no 
have a seat  let me finish my call 
and then l ll tell you 
try those air pillow insoles 
maybe the water kind  put them
in the fridge and freeze your foot 
l need to see him 
what a pity 
he has a meeting in five minutes 
l m sorry  he has a meeting right now 
l ll call you right back 
lf you want to do business with the city  
missy 
what the hell 
l m grey ellison  your wife s attorney 
l ll get back to you 
who do you think you are 
busting in here like this 
 l m in a hurry 
 lady  so am l 
your wife loves you  she wants you back 
other sources say
you don t want her back 
l d like you to work it out 
and l d like a favor from you 
are you nuts 
l got a list of names
and some pretty racy photos   
of a certain city official in a blue speedo 
l don t want to be a bitch   
but l have a problem 
and l need some strings pulled 
you never destroyed
those photographs  did you 
you took them to frank arnold
so he could pull strings at the d c f s 
you learned a few tricks
from the old master  didn t you 
bernie  l want you to buy me out 
you realize how many people would   
kill for what you ve achieved
in such a short amount of time 
you got a partnership 
a corner office big enough for basketball 
what are you giving it up for  love 
you got your value system
all screwed up somewhere along the line 
l think it was screwed up before 
l got to admit   
you re the last one l ever thought
would go quality of life on me 
honey    
grey  l think you owe me an explanation 
l don t owe you anything 
four years together
doesn t mean anything 
at least  after the way you ve behaved 
you owe me an apology 
did you turn in my friend
and his daughter 
what makes you think that 
did you 
there s nothing to hide 
it s a concerned phone call 
yes or no 
what difference does it make 
 just answer me 
 yes 
l thought so 
grey    
up yours 
grey  grey 
wait  grey  stop the car 
there it is 
that s it 
they cut my hair 
 let s get out of here  okay 
 okay 
am l out of this jam for good 
almost  they have to run
a check on your family 
that s easy  there isn t any 
then they ll run a check on me 
and if everything   
meets with their approval 
l ll get temporary custody 
and then  with your permission 
we ll start the adoption proceedings 
what does bill say 
he can t adopt you  honey 
not now  anyway 
because he s shiftless 
lt s more complicated than that 
anyway  it doesn t matter   
because l ll have you and he ll be with me 
 why didn t he come with you 
 he had to work 
you know that for sure 
that s what he said  why 
you don t have to be a genius
to figure it out 
he got me a mother  didn t he 
he can leave anytime he wants now 
bill 
l can t read it 
lt says 
  l m in the living room   
hi 
come here 
look  no swearing   
no gambling  no spitting  no punching 
and no kicking 
put a sock in it  l know what l m doing
