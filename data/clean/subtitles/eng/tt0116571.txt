you geek 
loser 
remember when krupp
pulled down your gym shorts

or in fourth grade when he smeared
dog crap all over your back
  and called you  turd boy    
  matt  shut up  okay 
i m sorry 
my parents are getting separated 
really 
groves  i m sorry 
did they say why 
not really 
i don t mean to scare you 
but that s usually a bad sign 
it means there s a lot wrong 
  who s moving out  your mom or dad 
  my dad 
also bad 
if your mom s moving out 
it s usually just temporary 
check out his suitcases 
if most of them are packed 
you re really in trouble 
  what do you mean 
  divorce 
no  they re not getting a divorce 
they said it was only a separation 
divorce isn t even up for consideration 
groves  i hate to break it to you 
but that s what they always say 
first it s separation  then it s divorce 
if i were you 
i d lock them in a closet
until they worked everything out 
but look on the bright side 
from now on  you get twice the gifts
on your birthday and christmas 
i m kidding 
hey 
hi 
how s it going 
bad 
same here 
what can we do about it 
i don t know 
have you been
down in the basement again 
i think there s mice down there 
come on 
  watch your step 
  stacy  i can t see  honey 
one  two  three 
surprise 
wow 
oh  my 
do you like it 
what s all this 
your anniversary party 
  when did you kids do all this 
  when we got home from school 
what do you think 
grover 
honey  you know the rules about this 
you re not supposed to touch it 
it s only for a very special occasion 
you guys are getting separated 
what could be more special than that 
good cake 
  thanks 
  thanks 
and you ve made the basement
look very festive 
we wanted to remind you
of your honeymoon in hawaii 
there s the lanai you stayed in 
i made it 
and dad 
we even found your old ukulele 
  my god  where did you find this 
  it was stuck behind the workbench 
  why don t you play something 
  yeah 
no  that s probably not a good idea 
listen  kids 
i m not sure you understood 
we did 
you guys are getting separated 
what we don t understand is why 
  grover   
  are you two having affairs 
no 
oh  no  kids   
it s like we said this morning 
daddy and i are just having some
difficulties  and we feel like
we need some time apart  that s all 
maybe you should get counseling 
no  honey  actually 
we don t need counseling 
the truth is 
no one ever really needs counseling 
we just need time apart
from each other 
  no  you don t 
  grover 
you guys spend enough time apart 
maybe you need some time together 
  that s enough  son 
  you guys used to get along just fine 
i remember when you couldn t
keep your hands off each other 
  grover  let s just stop this  okay 
  ned  don t yell at him 
i m not yelling 
i m trying to get some control here 
you don t get control
by yelling at people 
i m sorry  is there a list of ways
to get control that you ve made for us 
things i m doing  not doing 
should ve done 
  not doing

to get us put away 
yeah  but what if he does 
i mean  what if we end up in jail 
what would our parents do to us 
what would the other prisoners
do to us 
  they could be outside the house

   then maybe we should get    
  ned  you did say so
