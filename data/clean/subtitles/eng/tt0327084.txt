freaky pink primates
they must have come while
we were hibernating it was awful
they had wheels on their feet
and these sticks and they were
whacking me with these sticks
like it was some sort of sick game
you should have died
you should have laid down and died
dad
thats not the worst part
half the forest is gone
the oak trees and the berry bushes
theyre just theyre just gone
jeepers
whatll we do for food
how are we gonna live
i dont know
but heres what i do know
we will be fine as long
as no one goes over steve again
its called a hedge and it is not
to be feared my amphibious friend
it is the gateway to the good life
im a reptile actually
but you know its a common mistake
and you are
where are my manners im rj
dont think im prying
but i couldnt help overhearing
and i can shed a little light on what
this whole hedge situation is about
you see what was once mere wilderness
is now 54 acres of manmade
manicured airconditioned paradise
except for that littlebitty speck
you are here
no no thats a good thing
youre hibernators right
you gather food
store it for the winter
we fill the log
hammy
really this log this cavelike log
all the way to the top
ozzie
let me ask ya how longs it take
you know to fill the log
two hundred and seventyfour days
ever done it in a week
thats impossible
not if we work together
youve got the food gathering skills
ive got the knowhow
and they have the food
how much food
loads of food heaps of food
food out the wazoo
well whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo
i dont think
were interested in eating
i dont know
the guys making a lot of sense to me
i think we should listen
yeah im ok with wazoo food there
no youre not the tail is tingling
why didnt you say so
hold on hold on the what is what
when something doesnt feel right
my tail tingles let me tell you
everything youve said so far
is driving my tail crazy
listen verne right this isnt
something you need to be afraid of
well i am and for good reason
this is not a birthmark
thats because you
went over there without a guide
thanks for stopping by
were not interested
not interested in the most
delicious food youve ever tasted
no
oome on
not interested
ok i get it
i understand this is something
that youre just not open to
whoa
oh my
jeepers
what is that
that my friend is a magical
combination of corn flour
dehydrated cheese solids
bha bht and good old msg
aka the chip nacho cheese flavour
over here toss me one of those
more please more
yeah verne those were good
its all good
and were going over there tonight
yeah
welcome to suburbia
welcome to suburbia
wow
look at that
hey mom look at us look at us
oh my hon look at this
jeepers
hows that tail verne
listen if anybody in this family
gets hurt im holding you responsible
theyre having a good time
ill take responsibility for that
this is neat
look at that
hey spike look at that
hey verno
i took a few clippings out of my quills
to do a little comparison
look at this the grass
seems to be greener over here
verne are you certain
you came to the same place
yeah cos the raccoon says
ok enough about him i get it
so he can do a couple of tricks i mean
its not like he can walk on water
hey everybody this way to the food
that things huge
what is that
that is an suv
humans ride around in it
because they are slowly
losing their ability to walk
jeepers its so big
how many humans fit in there
usually one
hi this is gladys sharp
your president
of the homeowners association right
jeepers
what is that
easy easy dont worry
thats just a human being
and they are just as scared of us
as we are of them
now if a human does
happen to see you just lay down
roll over and give your privates
a good licking they love it
the charter which you signed says
the grass is supposed to be two inches
and according to my measuring stick
yours is 25
oould we just get the food and go
really do they have it or not
didnt you see it it was in the box
theyve always got food with them
we eat to live these guys live to eat
let me show you what im talking about
the human mouth is called a pie hole
the human being
is called a couch potato
that is a device to summon food
that is one of the many voices of food
that is the portal
for the passing of the food
that is one of the many
food transportation vehicles
humans bring the food take the food
ship the food they drive the food
they wear the food that gets
the food hot that keeps the food cold
that im not sure what that is
what do you know food
that is the altar
where they worship food
thats what they eat
when they eat too much
that gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food
food food food food
food
so you think they have enough
well they dont
for humans enough is never enough
and what do they do
with the stuff they dont eat
they put it in gleaming silver cans
just for us
sweetjeepers
dig in
good isnt it
ok
wow
share there everyone share
thats a diaper
and that does come out of a wazoo
so what do you think
was i right or was i right
and these things are just the scraps
waitll you see what comes
in the boxes packages and cans
im telling you stick with me
and in one week
we will gather enough food to
to feed a bear
what
just a figure of speech
halt intruders intruders
get out all of you
what is it baby
what are you doing
you said to lick our
no nix that run
run
get outta here
run
shoo
to the hedge
get out of here
i just mopped this patio
filthy vermin
vernes right that was horrible
you kids ok
stay close
well find other food right
see thats what i was talking about
these humans dont want us around
so we scared her
and she overreacted no biggie
no biggie
that is what we call a biggie
oome on think about the food
it was worth it for that food huh
that stuff is to die for
let me rephrase that
no to die for you nailed that part
look maybe our little forest life
looks primitive to a guy with a bag
what
but i think i speak
for the whole family
when i say we want nothing
to do with anything
thats over that hedge
oh come on
im done
you havent even tried doughnuts yet

of all human attention and devotion

to sit on their fat butts
watching tv fulfils both needs
at the same time
