  verne 
  jeepers 
  you ok 
  help him up 
  what was over there 
  freaky pink primates 
they must have come while
we were hibernating  it was awful 
they had wheels on their feet
and these sticks  and they were
whacking me with these sticks
like it was some sort of sick game 
you should have died 
you should have laid down and died 
  dad 
  that s not the worst part 
half the forest is gone 
the oak trees and the berry bushes 
they re just    they re just gone 
jeepers 
what ll we do for food 
how are we gonna live 
i don t know 
but here s what i do know 
we will be fine as long
as no one goes over steve again 
it s called a hedge  and it is not
to be feared  my amphibious friend 
it is the gateway to the good life 
i m a reptile  actually 
but  you know  it s a common mistake 
and you are 
where are my manners  i m rj 
don t think i m prying 
but i couldn t help overhearing 
and i can shed a little light on what
this whole hedge situation is about 
you see  what was once mere wilderness
is now 54 acres of man made 
manicured  air conditioned paradise 
except for that little bitty speck 
you are here 
no  no  that s a good thing 
you re hibernators  right 
you gather food 
store it for the winter 
  we fill the log 
  hammy 
really  this log  this cave like log 
  all the way to the top 
  ozzie 
let me ask ya  how long s it take 
  you know  to fill the log 
  two hundred and seventy four days 
  ever done it in a week 
  that s impossible 
not if we work together 
you ve got the food gathering skills 
i ve got the know how 
  and they have the food 
  how much food 
loads of food  heaps of food 
food out the wazoo 
well  whatever kind of food
comes out of a wazoo 
i don t think
we re interested in eating 
i don t know 
the guy s making a lot of sense to me 
  i think we should listen 
  yeah  i m ok with wazoo food there 
no  you re not  the tail is tingling 
  why didn t you say so 
  hold on  hold on  the what is what 
when something doesn t feel right 
my tail tingles  let me tell you 
everything you ve said so far
is driving my tail crazy 
listen  verne  right  this isn t
something you need to be afraid of 
well  i am  and for good reason 
this is not a birthmark 
that s because you
went over there without a guide 
thanks for stopping by 
we re not interested 
not interested in the most
delicious food you ve ever tasted 
  no 
  oome on 
not interested 
ok  i get it 
i understand  this is something
that you re just not open to 
whoa 
  oh  my 
  jeepers 
what is that 
that  my friend  is a magical
combination of corn flour 
dehydrated cheese solids 
bha  bht and good old msg 
a k a   the chip  nacho cheese flavour 
  over here  toss me one of those 
  more please  more 
yeah  verne  those were good 
it s all good 
and we re going over there  tonight 
yeah 
welcome to suburbia 
welcome to suburbia 
  wow 
  look at that 
hey  mom  look at us  look at us 
oh  my  hon  look at this 
jeepers 
how s that tail  verne 
listen  if anybody in this family
gets hurt  i m holding you responsible 
they re having a good time 
i ll take responsibility for that 
  this is neat 
  look at that 
  hey  spike  look at that 
  hey  verno 
i took a few clippings out of my quills
to do a little comparison 
look at this  the grass
seems to be greener over here 
verne  are you certain
you came to the same place 
yeah  cos the raccoon says   
ok  enough about him  i get it 
so he can do a couple of tricks  i mean 
it s not like he can walk on water 
hey  everybody  this way to the food 
  that thing s huge 
  what is that 
that is an suv 
humans ride around in it
because they are slowly
losing their ability to walk 
  jeepers  it s so big 
  how many humans fit in there 
usually  one 
hi  this is gladys sharp 
your president 
of the homeowner s association  right 
  jeepers 
  what is that 
easy  easy  don t worry 
that s just a human being 
and they are just as scared of us
as we are of them 
now  if a human does
happen to see you  just lay down 
roll over and give your privates
a good licking  they love it 
the charter  which you signed  says
the grass is supposed to be two inches 
and according to my measuring stick 
yours is 2 5 
oould we just get the food and go 
really  do they have it or not 
didn t you see it  it was in the box 
they ve always got food with them 
we eat to live  these guys live to eat 
let me show you what i m talking about 
the human mouth is called a  pie hole  
the human being
is called a  couch potato  
that is a device to summon food 
that is one of the many voices of food 
that is the portal
for the passing of the food 
that is one of the many
food transportation vehicles 
humans bring the food  take the food 
ship the food  they drive the food 
they wear the food  that gets
the food hot  that keeps the food cold 
that    i m not sure what that is 
what do you know  food 
that is the altar
where they worship food 
that s what they eat
when they eat too much 
that gets rid of guilt
so they can eat more food 
food  food  food  food 
food 
so you think they have enough 
well  they don t 
for humans  enough is never enough 
and what do they do
with the stuff they don t eat 
they put it in gleaming  silver cans 
just for us 
sweetjeepers 
dig in 
  good  isn t it 
  ok 
  wow 
  share there  everyone  share 
that s a diaper 
and that does come out of a wazoo 
so  what do you think 
was i right or was i right 
and these things are just the scraps 
wait ll you see what comes
in the boxes  packages and cans 
i m telling you  stick with me 
and in one week
we will gather enough food to   
  to feed a bear 
  what 
just a figure of speech 
halt  intruders  intruders 
get out  all of you 
what is it  baby 
  what are you doing 
  you said to lick our   
no  nix that  run 
  run 
  get outta here 
run 
  shoo 
  to the hedge 
get out of here 
i just mopped this patio 
filthy vermin 
verne s right  that was horrible 
  you kids ok 
  stay close 
  we ll find other food  right 
  see  that s what i was talking about 
these humans don t want us around 
so we scared her 
and she overreacted  no biggie 
no biggie 
that is what we call a biggie 
oome on  think about the food 
it was worth it for that food  huh 
that stuff is to die for 
let me rephrase that 
no  to die for  you nailed that part 
look  maybe our little forest life
looks primitive to a guy with a bag 
  what 
  but i think i speak
for the whole family
when i say we want nothing
to do with anything
that s over that hedge 
  oh  come on 
  i m done 
you haven t even tried doughnuts yet 
you wanna store fat 
that is the way to store some fat 
you ll be sweatin  through the winter 
  we ll eat the bark  right

  it s a big  long list  you can see 
you re a    organised little guy 
aren t you  nice job 
you know what  i know a place
so chock full of food 
we could get it all back in one night 
great  let s go  where is it 
  inside that house 
  what 
  what is the point of this thing 
  just send it down
