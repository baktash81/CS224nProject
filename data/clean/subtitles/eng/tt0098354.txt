i don t know 
i feel like something s
going to happen

it will pass  i assure you 
come and get it  milo

  a matter of good breeding milo

well  i m not taking another shower 
yeah 
but i m really sorry
that i m going to miss your coming out 
what a coincidence
the way things turn out  huh

besides  i have already been dating
for years  joke

   the one 
we are the one

all right 
the hero  the best player 
our hero   
   bill whitney

you are for the girls

they are just using
their athletic ability to get the votes   
   of the childish morons
in this audience 
looks to me like you just lost
the moron vote marty 
alright 
hey  let s carry on with the debate 
candidate whitney  you may respond
concerning the proposed dress code 
yeah   
well   
we should have a dress code 
i guess 
   and i think we should follow it   
   in the most possible  ah strict 
as we possibly can 
what i mean is if we can prove
to the administration   
   that a dress code
really is a problem   
i mean just imagine everybody walking
around in those idiotic clothes 
like marty over here
is wearing right now 
and i mean everybody 
it would make them think that there
was some kind of a conspiracy 
hey  she s bad news man 
the debate and the game  i nailed the
guy  it was a shoe in  the election 
well i m glad to see you re allowing yourself
some success without sabotaging it 
let me ask you   
   how do you feel about your family
in light of all these recent victories 
my family 
yeah 
ah  nothing 
i mean  i don t think about them 
they don t think about me  we re just   
   we re just one big happy family 
except for a little incest and psychosis 
look  i know you re being fishiest   
   but i think you really believe that 
no 
no  no  i don t 
we are getting along much better now 
really 
hey   
let s not waste our time bullshitting 
all right 
they don t approve of me  okay 
they don t accept my friends 
they don t talk to me like they do
jenny 
and they don t even look like me 
i told you to teenagers sometimes feel alienated
from those closest to them 
i think i was adopted 
don t you think
that sounds a little bit paranoid 
no  i ve never been paranoid 
just a little bit paranoid 
within normal ranges 
you know  you really deserve
what s going to happen to you 
what s going to happen 
you re going to make
a wonderful contribution to society
