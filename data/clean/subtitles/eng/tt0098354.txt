irrational fear

their athletic ability to get the votes
of the childish morons
in this audience
looks to me like you just lost
the moron vote marty
alright
hey lets carry on with the debate
candidate whitney you may respond
concerning the proposed dress code
yeah
well
we should have a dress code
i guess
and i think we should follow it
in the most possible ah strict
as we possibly can
what i mean is if we can prove
to the administration
that a dress code
really is a problem
i mean just imagine everybody walking
around in those idiotic clothes
like marty over here
is wearing right now
and i mean everybody
it would make them think that there
was some kind of a conspiracy
hey shes bad news man
the debate and the game i nailed the
guy it was a shoe in the election
well im glad to see youre allowing yourself
some success without sabotaging it
let me ask you
how do you feel about your family
in light of all these recent victories
my family
yeah
ah nothing
i mean i dont think about them
they dont think about me were just
were just one big happy family
except for a little incest and psychosis
look i know youre being fishiest
but i think you really believe that
no
no no i dont
we are getting along much better now
really
hey
lets not waste our time bullshitting
all right
they dont approve of me okay
they dont accept my friends
they dont talk to me like they do
jenny
