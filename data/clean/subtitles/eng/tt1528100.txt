the hittites are trying
to cross the border
obviously
what else would they be doing
anticipating an invasion by us
according to our information
they think we are
preparing an attack
which we are not
what i dont want to do and wont do
is sit here
and wait until were fighting
hittite armies
outside the palace walls
come
what do the entrails say
they dont say anything
they imply
and thats open to interpretation
so interpret them
well win or we wont
in a preemptive attack
its a yes or a no
and its not clear
but something else is
in the battle a leader will be saved
and his savior will someday lead
then the entrails should also say
that we will abandon reason
and be guided by omens
great sekhmet
pharaoh drinks in your name
and prays for victory
over the hittites at kadesh
your first order of business
when the time comes you retire her
i will
i dont know why my father hasnt
but just in case
if you see me in any real danger out there
ride the other way
im serious
when i look at you
i still see the two boys
who grew up together close as brothers
if for any reason
you ever forget that
let these remind you
long enough to be effective
from horseback
not so long that you trip over them
this is his youve got mine
thats right thats how i want it
you have each others
to keep each other safe
promise me youll do that
always
seti seti seti
seti
there
deploy amun division to the north
ra division to the center
and ptah to the south
and we hold seth in reserve
in reserve
yes
we should concentrate our strength
in the center
you should concentrate yours
on fighting
leave the generalship to me
fire
fire
charge
take ramses go
go
turn around turn around
moses moses moses
moses
what happened out there
nothing
i asked the commanders the same thing
they too lied
and im tired of it
he thinks something happened
but it didnt
meaning
the high priestess her prophecy
she said she couldnt see who would win
the other one
the leader will be saved
and so on
you saved my sons life
yes
sit
thank you is not sufficient
but thank you
i know you dont believe
in omens or prophecies
but i do believe
and i respect that
but this isnt anything
this doesnt even make any sense
because youre not my blood
yes
its true you cant succeed me
not in the usual way
not in any way
in any way imaginable sitting here
its horrible to say this
about ones own son
but i trust you more than him to lead
the hittite chariotry
crashed through our defense
and began its attack
i found myself
surrounded by the enemy
no soldier no shieldbearer
facing a desperate fight for my life
only with the help of the gods
did i defeat our attackers
and rejoin ra division
stop there
anything youd like to rephrase
no
shall i go on
no im sure the rest is fine
whats next
pithom
what about it
the situation the slaves
fine ramses
what
go up there meet with the viceroy
look around make a report
me
it will be yours someday
take an interest in it
what else
ill go to see the viceroy
no
ill go
its beneath you
its beneath any general
ill do it
ramses
can we forget what happened
on the battlefield
if our positions had been reversed
i wouldve saved your life too
i know i know
it was a good shot
even if the gods did guide your aim
a little venom in your blood
is a good thing
makes you less vulnerable
to the next poisonous bite
maybe even my fathers
welcome to pithom
you get used to the smell
the viceroy seems to be enjoying
a good share of his resources
this isnt a job everyone wants to do
my lord
a certain degree of comfort is necessary
to keep up his spirits
you know what the problem is
people live too long these days
every year the death rate
lags further behind the birth rate
and these people
they reproduce like its a sport
this is the problem
a growing work force
no of course not
its good for production
of course it is but only to a point
when that population wants you dead
yes its a problem
so either im given more troops
to maintain order
or i start thinning out the herd
you start slaughtering people
for no reason other than
this precarious theory
you will provoke the very thing
you say you wish to avoid
fine then give me the troops
lets go down and talk to them
why on earth
youre worried about sedition
lets find out if that worry is real
by talking to them
by looking at them
when i talk with them
you can tell a lot about somebody
looking him in the eye
let me tell you something
about hebrews
they are a conniving combative people
do you know what israelite means
in their own language
he who fights with god
he who wrestles with god
there is a difference
i may not be as educated as you
which apparently you want to remind me of
but i have to deal with them every day
i know what im talking about
you dont have to come
ill go down there myself
stop
why is he being punished
persistent troublemaker my lord
why is he smiling
he says he feels no pain my lord
then why whip him
you were not gathered up at random
i asked to see
the elders
come on what do you pray for
we pray to see canaan again
canaan again
youve never seen it
ive seen canaan
ive seen that its inhabited
by tribes fiercer than egypts military
so you wont be returning to it
or if you do from it
god says otherwise
which god
your god the god of abraham
the god that says that you are special
that you are chosen
come here up
come here
hes wrong
i can see youre unconvinced
and thats a problem
because next to unrealistic belief
lies fanaticism
and next to that sedition
and next to that revolution
and it all starts with the elders
whats your name
whats yours
ill tell you
i am moses son of bithia
grandson of horemheb
record this ones name
and the rest of them
bring in the next group
my name is nun
my lord
stop there
let him through
theres something the elder
has to tell you
but not here
say where and when
the prayer house tonight
here
i see youve survived your adventure
sorry to make you wait again
im not waiting
how was your trip to the quarry
fine
you saw what im up against
tell me
is there any more of my records
i could get for you before you leave
you can tell me
has all of this
been reported to memphis
was it approved
do you have it in writing
of course its on record
so you dont mind if we check
of course i dont mind
but i dont understand
whats gone wrong
have i done something to displease you
and if so is there any way
i could please you
you can stop living like a king
youre not one
and you will occupy
the land of canaan
canaan is already occupied
god promises we will return
in chains or in coffins
as free men
into a land flowing with milk and honey
can they at least wait outside
were not dangerous
wait by the horses
do you believe in coincidence
as much as anything else
i dont think this is one
what isnt
you coming to pithom
why did you come
business
sit
whos your father
i know you dont know his name
only that he was a general
in pharaohs army
unnamed by your mother
i can see
this is making you uncomfortable
this will interest you
there was no general
your mother
the woman you call your mother
has no children
you were born a slave
dont go dont go
its better for you that i do
im leaving
if you leave now
youll just come back
because you know somethings wrong
youve always felt it
please
everybody out
out
the year of your birth
there was a prophecy
that our leader would be born
to liberate us from our bondage
and so there was an edict
from memphis
to kill every firstborn hebrew boy
your parents didnt wait
for that to happen
any chance of your survival
was better than no chance
they handed you to your sister
she took you in a basket
to the banks of the river
and she floated you to where she knew
pharaoh paramesses daughter
bithia bathed
bithia took you and your sister
miriam as a maid
and raised you as her own
she probably even loved you
but she never told you or anyone else
the truth
you are hebrew
the truth
the truth is
its not even that good a story
and i thought you people
were meant to be
good storytellers
you slave
you
do you expect a reward
for this information
our reward is being of service to you
that said if there were
some token you had in mind
beyond that
we wouldnt refuse it
how about this then
what about if i dont kill you
that would be sufficient payment
you people
please leave
please
how did it go
we can talk about that another time
we can talk about it now
if only as a respite from this army
of grimfaced physicians
sit
were taking a thorough look
at the city records
and the man is clearly a thief
its one of lifes
more depressing ironies
that the men who crave power
are best fitted to acquire it
and least fitted to exercise it
whats wrong moses
youre sick
something else is troubling you
i can tell
no nothing else
may you be alert
rejuvenated and protected by the gods
every moment of your eternal life
and to the left
no your left
more more more
good
it is tall
monuments are monuments
for a reason they inspire
inspire what in this case
in this and in every case power
say it out loud whatever it is
the viceroy of pithom is outside
hes not on the agenda
he can go back to pithom until he is
no we should deal with this
bring him in
if you came here to beg
the new kings forgiveness
it wont work
arrest him
wait please
may i at least respond
i beg you
its in your interest
you make it short
i will
to the king alone
my advice is that
he and the other generals
also leave the room
really
thats your advice
you are not his advisor
thats right you are
thats right
moses
moses
everybody but the viceroy
out
terrible news
there you are
so
the viceroy
you didnt arrest him
you didnt take
your chief advisors advice
no he came
he told me of an incident
involving two guards
one of which survived the attack
and i told him i did not care
and then he told me the most
unbelievable story
told to him he said
by very reliable sources
then when pressed
he admitted that they were hebrew spies
you know what im talking about
yes
and what do you make of it
i think its offensive
and i think its ridiculous
yes yes
you of all people a hebrew
and i said
how can i believe such a story
cousin
you cant
what if i take the chance
of not believing it moses
what am i to do
bithia
mother
the man is a thief
my son discovers this
not you
and he reports it to your father
who would have hanged this thief
if he hadnt been dying himself
you believe his feeble
selfserving lies
all i want to know is if it is true
i didnt ask for a tirade
to talk about this any longer
would dignify it
and i wont do that
answer the question
yes or no
was i talking to you
bring her in bring her in
now
miriam
come sit down
now im going to ask you some things
that are going to seem
very strange to you
i just would like you
to answer them truthfully
how do you know moses
you know how i know him
and you
i helped raise you both
so you are not his sister then
of course not
and youre not a hebrew
no
place your arm on the table
ramses
dont be stupid
i am not talking to you
i am talking to her
your whole arm on the table miriam
thank you
ramses
dont take this any further
dont take this any further or what
do not take this any further
are you quite sure about that
get your hand off it or use it now
or perhaps youd like to answer
the question
then ill proceed
miriam im going to ask you again
and if your answer is again no
i apologize for what happens next
are you his sister
no
yes
yes
you dont need a reason to kill him
but you have one
this was treason
how was it treason
he just admitted he knew
that wasnt an admission
simply did not want her arm lopped off
i saw it in his eyes
he does not believe this story
i dont want to believe it
you want to believe it because its an
opportunity to be rid of him
which you always wanted
i didnt say exiled i said dead
that im sure will follow
where hes going
khyan
allow me to talk to my mother
yes sir yes
come miriam
it isnt every man who would protect a
servant whos nothing more to him than that
certainly no one else in this family
including me
i wouldnt have said
what he wanted to hear
and neither would she
thats how much we love you
we
its not true
it is true
you were wearing this
when i brought you to the river
i took it off you for obvious reasons
thats you
the connection between you
and our mother
your sister saved your life
now you saved hers
moshe
miriam
sorry sir
moses
moses
i have nothing to steal
my horse is dead
were not here for your horse moshe

where are you from
west of here

east
what did you do
what do you mean
you committed some crime
with respect
your daughters invited me for some food
they did not tell me
there would be an interrogation
im sorry
im just curious
you are welcome to get cleaned up
before dinner
if that appeals to you
and stay the night if you want
before continuing on
to wherever it is
thank you
describe memphis to someone
whos never been there and never will
its
i dont want to say civilized
because i dont want to offend
but it is civilized
theres more there than sheep and goats
theres more here than that
really where
im sorry that was rude
that was rude
im not ignorant
just because i live here
i can see that
i can tell you one thing
this is by far
the nicest place
between here and there
and so youre leaving
of course
theres nothing here
for someone like me
when
today
remember this moment in time
for after these vows
you shall say to the world
this is my husband this is my wife
i zipporah

accept you zipporah
accept you moses
to be no other than yourself
loving what i know of you
trusting what i do not yet know

and faith
in your abiding love for me
in all that life may bring us
i pledge my love
i pledge my love
who makes you happy
you do
whats the most important thing
in your life
you are
where would you rather be
nowhere
and when will you leave me
never
proceed
i said per se
i dont want to discuss my tomb per se
i want to discuss why you seem to want
to discuss it all the time
respectfully
it should have been your first
construction order on taking the throne
itll be a big project
as you might imagine
so is my house apparently
is there a problem with the palace
its not done
it wont be long now

he wont be at peace until you do
or are they not people
in your opinion
who are you
i am
i am
you were hit on the head
anything you saw
or think you saw afterwards
was an effect of that
the storm
the storm started before
i was hit on the head
it was not a storm
fine fine
the storm was something
it was something else
but the boy was all in your head
how do you know
how do you know
because god isnt a boy
then what does he look like
describe him
describe him to someone like me
do you know what you sound like
yes i sound delusional
yes
yes
you just need more rest
yes yes
i have to tell you something
i have to tell you something
ive not been completely honest

thank you father
joshua i remember you

keep your eye on the horse
thank you
welcome back brother
aaron
your brother
ithamar
ithamar this
is your famous uncle moses
he was once a prince of egypt
im fine
everybodys fine
you sleep so well my boy
because you know you are loved
ive never slept so well
im told i should address you
as ramses the great now
moses
youre alive
im glad youre alive
really
is that why you only sent
two assassins to kill me
my mother
dont blame her
yes she wanted you dead
who do you think hid your sword
where you would find it
moses
im not here
to take your throne
its not about the prophecy
that worries you so much
this is something else
i have been told
that things here have become
much worse
things are better than
they ever have been moses
no
we have order
order
the slaves
their bodies burn night and day now
ive seen it with my own eyes
you call that order
theyre slaves
no theyre not
what would you expect
theyre egyptians
they should be treated as egyptians
they should have the same rights
they should be paid for their work
or you must set them free
they are not egyptians
they are slaves moses
what else do you expect
they wouldnt know what to do
if all of a sudden they were left
to fend for themselves like animals
do not call them animals
listen
from an economic standpoint alone
what youre asking
is problematic to say the least
i didnt expect to hear a simple yes
but i do not want to hear a simple no
is that what you are telling me
are you saying no
im not saying no
im saying time
time
youre listening to hebrews
im not listening to hebrews
who are you talking to
god
god
which god
youre not seriously
considering his proposal
is it a proposal
if a man is holding a dagger
to your throat minister
is it
i stand corrected
thats a demand
he has lost his mind
hes found a god his god
not one of ours
so i would like moses
i want moses dead
did you hear me
yes
then go
and
his family too
moses
wheres moses
moses wheres moses
moses
his family
where are they
this is not moses
this is not his family
this is a man
his wife
and his child
who when asked the simple question
where is he
answered we dont know
carry this image home with you tonight
and discuss why you would protect him
knowing that tomorrow at this time
there will be another family
where this one is
and another the day after
and the day after that
dare i say yours
go ahead
i want to join the fight
in there
joshua use your knee
its good
both eyes open
nock draw
loose
advance
nock draw
loose
draw
loose
draw
loose
again
there are two kinds of warfare
each is dictated by numbers
with greater numbers
you attack the enemy head on
you stab it in the heart
with fewer numbers
you come at it from the side
you cut off the blood
that pumps the heart
the army supply lines
no
the peoples supply lines
their food
their property
their comfort
what would that achieve
everything
only the egyptian people
can force him
to accept our demands
for freedom we must force them
to make him say yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
with me
with me
ready
youre not going to do anything
i didnt say that
where have you been
watching you fail
wars of attrition take time
at this rate youll take years
a generation
i am prepared to fight for that long
im not
i thought we were making progress
now youre impatient
after 400 years of slavery
am i the only one sitting here
whos done nothing about this until now
i do know
a few things about military action
still if youre not going
to listen to me
then why did you take me away
from my family
i didnt
you did
you dont need me
maybe not
so what do i do nothing
for now
you can watch
divine goddess kebechet
i humbly call upon you
to purify the waters
of our lifegiving river
how long will it take
not long
but longer than that
ramses ramses
yes
enough
do something
theyre just frogs
back away back away
unclean
no no no dont drink
unclean
the nile as we know
carries a certain amount of clay
this year theres much more of it
than usual
drifting in on the currents
settling on the riverbeds
and kicked up by the wild thrashing
of the crocodiles
this thrashing not only
dramatically changed the color of the water
but it fouled it
to the point of killing the fish
but frogs as we know
can get out of the water
when they have to
which they did
but frogs still need water
and when they cant find it
in the streets of our city
they what
they die
they die
and then they decompose
and then the gnats come
and the maggots come and the flies come
and then
and then what
the flies die
speak up
its in hebrew
hebrew
read it
these catastrophes
are the work of god
and they have not finished
they will get worse
we need to reach a settlement
for both our sakes
so the work of god
here is my settlement to you
work quotas shall be doubled
and you will get no straw
to make your bricks
perhaps your god
will provide it for you
i was impressed at first
not anymore
this is affecting everyone
so who are you punishing
whats wrong with him
its sick
what is this
did you do this
not me
is this you
no no
whats happened to him
we have made great strides in medicine
however there are still a few hidden diseases
that we dont completely understand
animals are not exempt
and there is some conjecture
that these maladies can migrate
from the smallest creature
like a
a fly
have you been out to the river lately
i appealed to kebechet again
and six more gods
is that it
are you done
i am
are you trying to say something
with your absence
is it meant to humble me
because it will not
initial reports suggest
more than 10 million square cubits
of crops have been lost
the quartermaster has suggested
we return a portion
of the supplement to the civil granary
an act of mercy
your people are starving
are you suggesting
that i should starve too
no
people have plenty of water
they will endure
aim
fire
aim
fire
is that you
moses
brother
have you come to negotiate
because im ready
as i have an offer for you
one more thing happens
and i will bring my own plague to you
you see every hebrew child
not yet walking
they never shall
because i will drown them in the nile
as you should have been
you say that you didnt cause all this
your god did
i am the god i am the god
so lets just see
whos more effective at killing
you
this god
or me
nice of you to come
hes given you what you asked
not yet but his own people
are turning against him
and his army
it will
i disagree
something worse has to happen
i disagree
anything more would be
would be what
what were you about to say
cruel inhumane
its not easy to see
the people who i grew up with
suffering this much
what about the people you
didnt grow up with
what thought did you give to them
you still dont think of them
as yours do you
as long as ramses
has an army behind him
nothing will change
anything more is just revenge
revenge
after 400 years of brutal subjugation
these pharaohs who imagine theyre living gods
theyre nothing more than flesh and blood
i want to see them on their knees
begging for it to stop
im tired of talking with a messenger
general
i have heard ramses final threat
so let me tell you
whats going to happen next
no no
you cannot do this
i want no part of this
stay
hold
moses
leave him
khyan
moses
i could have you killed
i dont think so
unless you do it yourself
your own soldiers let me in
i am not negotiating anymore
thats not why im here
i came to tell you
that something is coming
that is out of my control
something that will affect thousands
and thousands of citizens
and it will affect you very personally
unless you accept what ive asked for
and announce it publicly
before the sun goes down
ramses
do not turn your back on me
this has nothing to do with you and i
this is far beyond that
this is about egypts survival
do you understand
sunset
after that it will be too late
what will be too late
you protect your child
you protect your child tonight
my child
is that a threat
is that a threat moses
moses
tell everyone
to slaughter a lamb
and mark their doors
and their doorposts tonight
with its blood
why
pity the lambs if i am wrong
if im right
we will bless them for eternity
bennu bennu
no
ramses
ramses
ramses
no
zechariah
zechariah
kneel
get out
murderer
child killer
their children died last night
as did mine
is this your god
a killer of children
what kind of fanatics
worship such a god
no hebrew child died last night
get
out
go
every one of you
go
go to canaan if thats what you want
back to the homeland of your dreams
but go
as you command
this is the route i took
from here we go south to the red sea
the straits are here
at low tide we can cross on foot
you know why you sleep so well my boy
because you know you are loved
with respect
if were going to
recapture 400000 slaves
we might need more than three divisions
were not recapturing anyone
forward
we should rest
no
were not safe until we cross the sea
moshe
ramses
4000 men
a thousand chariots
how far behind us
four days
less if they dont rest the horses
ramses
ramses
we need to rest the horses
and the men
the straits are that way
the longest easiest route
is down the western coast
or we go through the mountains
the mountains
why why dont we take that route
we can but so can ramses
the mountain passes are dangerous
but they are too narrow
for ramses chariots
he couldnt follow
that would give us needed time
what does god tell you
the mountains
can we make it
forward
which way from here
stay here
we need your help
i dont know where i am
you wont help me
you wont help them
this way
move out
this way
are you sure
im very sure
i mean are you sure we can make it
across with our equipment
our chariots
they didnt think they could
with theirs
how would they know
theyve never been here
moses may have
is this high tide or low tide
doesnt matter
this isnt the straits is it
no
do you even know where we are
yes
were at a point on the earth
where there is a sea ahead
and an army behind
so now what
army or no army
we have to rest
i have misled all of them
i have abandoned my family
i have failed you
im not what i thought i was
what is it
the current
its strong
we need to cross here
we need to cross now
we cross here
we cross here
ready yourselves
we cross here
go tell them go
your orders
are like the lash of the egyptian whip
we are no longer slaves
and yet you are not free
you have lost sight
of canaan
land of your forebears
you have honored me
with your trust
now i honor you with my faith
follow me and you will be free
stay and you will perish
do not be afraid
god is with us
go ready yourselves
go
god is with us
pass the word we cross here
as quickly as you can
gather your things
and form in groups
quickly

my family
is not far from here
your family
my other family my wife my son
i was thinking
maybe i could convince them
convince them to join us
but perhaps thats
perhaps thats not wise
of course they should come
we have a long way to go
a lot can happen
and then
we get there if we get there
you dont think theyll
let us settle in canaan
theyll see us as invaders
they wont have a choice
were as big as any tribe
were as big as a nation of tribes
and that concerns me even more

this many people
you have to ask
but we all have the same goal
we do now
what happens when we stop running

in your life

a leader can falter
but stone
