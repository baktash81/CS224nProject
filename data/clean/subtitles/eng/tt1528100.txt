the hittites are trying
to cross the border 
obviously 
what else would they be doing 
anticipating an invasion by us 
according to our information 
they think we are   
preparing an attack 
which we are not 
what i don t want to do  and won t do 
is sit here   
and wait until we re fighting
hittite armies   
outside the palace walls 
come 
what do the entrails say 
they don t  say  anything 
they imply 
and that s open to interpretation 
so  interpret them 
we ll win or we won t
in a preemptive attack 
it s a yes or a no 
and it s not clear 
but something else is 
in the battle  a leader will be saved   
and his savior will someday lead 
then the entrails should also say   
that we will abandon reason   
and be guided by omens 
great sekhmet   
pharaoh drinks in your name   
and prays for victory
over the hittites at kadesh 
your first order of business
when the time comes  you retire her 
i will 
i don t know why my father hasn t 
but  just in case   
if you see me in any real danger out there 
ride the other way 
i m serious 
when i look at you 
i still see the two boys   
who grew up together  close as brothers 
if  for any reason   
you ever forget that   
let these remind you 
long enough to be effective
from horseback   
not so long that you trip over them 
this is his  you ve got mine 
that s right  that s how i want it 
you have each other s   
to keep each other safe 
promise me you ll do that   
always 
seti  seti  seti 
seti 
there 
deploy amun division to the north 
ra division to the center   
and ptah to the south 
and we hold seth in reserve 
 in reserve 
 yes 
we should concentrate our strength
in the center 
you should concentrate yours
on fighting 
leave the generalship to me 
fire 
fire 
charge 
take ramses  go 
go 
turn around  turn around 
moses  moses  moses 
moses 
what happened out there 
nothing 
i asked the commanders the same thing 
they  too  lied 
and i m tired of it 
he thinks something happened 
 but it didn t 
 meaning 
the high priestess  her prophecy 
she said she couldn t see who would win 
the other one 
 the leader will be saved    
and so on 
you saved my son s life 
yes 
sit 
 thank you  is not sufficient   
but thank you 
i know you don t believe
in omens or prophecies   
but i do believe 
and i respect that 
but this isn t anything 
this doesn t even make any sense 
because you re not my blood 
yes 
it s true  you can t succeed me 
not in the usual way 
not in any way 
in any way imaginable  sitting here 
it s horrible to say this
about one s own son   
but i trust you more than him to lead 
 the hittite chariotry   
 crashed through our defense
and began its attack 
 i found myself
surrounded by the enemy   
 no soldier  no shield bearer   
 facing a desperate fight for my life 
 only with the help of the gods   
 did i defeat our attackers   
 and rejoin ra division  
stop there 
anything you d like to rephrase 
no 
 shall i go on 
 no  i m sure the rest is fine 
what s next 
pithom 
what about it 
the situation  the slaves 
fine  ramses 
what 
go up there  meet with the viceroy 
look around  make a report 
me 
it will be yours someday 
take an interest in it 
what else 
i ll go to see the viceroy 
no 
i ll go 
it s beneath you 
it s beneath any general 
i ll do it 
ramses   
can we forget what happened   
on the battlefield 
if our positions had been reversed   
i would ve saved your life  too 
i know  i know 
it was a good shot 
even if the gods did guide your aim 
a little venom in your blood
is a good thing 
makes you less vulnerable
to the next poisonous bite 
maybe even my father s 
welcome to pithom 
you get used to the smell 
the viceroy seems to be enjoying
a good share of his resources 
this isn t a job everyone wants to do 
my lord 
a certain degree of comfort is necessary
to keep up his spirits 
you know what the problem is 
people live too long these days 
every year  the death rate
lags further behind the birth rate 
and these people   
they reproduce like it s a sport 
this is the problem 
a growing work force 
no  of course not 
it s good for production 
of course it is  but only to a point 
when that population wants you dead   
yes  it s a problem 
so  either i m given more troops
to maintain order   
or i start thinning out the herd 
you start slaughtering people   
for no reason other than
this precarious theory   
you will provoke the very thing
you say you wish to avoid 
fine  then give me the troops 
let s go down and talk to them 
why on earth 
you re worried about sedition 
let s find out if that worry is real 
by talking to them 
by looking at them   
when i talk with them 
you can tell a lot about somebody   
looking him in the eye 
let me tell you something   
about hebrews 
they are a conniving  combative people 
do you know what  israelite  means   
in their own language 
 he who fights with god  
 he who wrestles with god  
there is a difference 
i may not be as educated as you 
which  apparently  you want to remind me of 
but i have to deal with them every day 
i know what i m talking about 
you don t have to come 
i ll go down there myself 
stop 
why is he being punished 
persistent troublemaker  my lord 
why is he smiling 
he says he feels no pain  my lord 
then why whip him 
you were not gathered up at random 
i asked to see   
the elders 
come on  what do you pray for 
we pray to see canaan again 
canaan again 
you ve never seen it 
i ve seen canaan 
i ve seen that it s inhabited
by tribes fiercer than egypt s military 
so  you won t be returning to it   
or  if you do  from it 
 god says otherwise 
 which god 
your god  the god of abraham 
the god that says that you are special 
that you are chosen 
come here  up 
come here 
he s wrong 
i can see you re unconvinced 
and that s a problem 
because next to unrealistic belief
lies fanaticism   
and next to that  sedition 
and next to that  revolution 
and it all starts with the elders 
what s your name 
what s yours 
i ll tell you 
i am moses  son of bithia   
grandson of horemheb 
record this one s name
and the rest of them 
bring in the next group 
my name is nun 
my lord 
 stop there 
 let him through 
there s something the elder
has to tell you 
but not here 
say where and when 
the prayer house  tonight 
here 
i see you ve survived your adventure 
sorry to make you wait again 
i m not waiting 
 how was your trip to the quarry 
 fine 
you saw what i m up against 
tell me   
is there any more of my records
i could get for you before you leave 
you can tell me   
has all of this
been reported to memphis 
was it approved 
do you have it in writing 
of course  it s on record 
so you don t mind if we check 
of course i don t mind 
but i don t understand
what s gone wrong 
have i done something to displease you 
and if so  is there any way
i could please you 
you can stop living like a king 
you re not one 
    and you will occupy
the land of canaan  
canaan is already occupied 
god promises we will return 
in chains or in coffins 
as free men   
into a land flowing with milk and honey 
can they at least wait outside 
we re not dangerous 
wait by the horses 
do you believe in coincidence 
as much as anything else 
i don t think this is one 
what isn t 
you coming to pithom 
why did you come 
business 
sit 
who s your father 
i know you don t know his name   
only that he was a general
in pharaoh s army   
unnamed by your mother 
i can see
this is making you uncomfortable 
this will interest you 
there was no general 
your mother   
the woman you call your mother 
has no children 
you were born a slave 
don t go  don t go 
it s better for you that i do 
i m leaving 
if you leave now 
you ll just come back   
because you know something s wrong 
you ve always felt it 
please 
everybody out 
out 
the year of your birth   
there was a prophecy
that our leader would be born   
to liberate us from our bondage 
and so  there was an edict
from memphis   
to kill every firstborn hebrew boy 
your parents didn t wait
for that to happen 
any chance of your survival
was better than no chance 
they handed you to your sister 
she took you in a basket
to the banks of the river   
and she floated you to where she knew   
pharaoh paramesse s daughter 
bithia  bathed 
bithia took you and your sister 
miriam  as a maid   
and raised you as her own 
she probably even loved you   
but she never told you  or anyone else 
the truth 
you are hebrew 
the truth 
the truth is 
it s not even that good a story 
and i thought you people
were meant to be   
good storytellers 
you  slave 
you 
do you expect a reward
for this information 
our reward is being of service to you 
that said  if there were   
some token you had in mind
beyond that   
we wouldn t refuse it 
how about this  then 
what about if i don t kill you 
that would be sufficient payment 
you people 
please leave 
please 
how did it go 
we can talk about that another time 
we can talk about it now   
if only as a respite from this army
of grim faced physicians 
sit 
we re taking a thorough look
at the city records   
and the man is clearly a thief 
it s one of life s
more depressing ironies   
that the men who crave power   
are best fitted to acquire it 
and least fitted to exercise it 
what s wrong  moses 
you re sick 
something else is troubling you 
i can tell 
no  nothing else 
may you be alert   
rejuvenated and protected by the gods   
every moment of your eternal life 
and to the left 
no  your left 
more  more  more 
good 
it is tall 
monuments are monuments   
for a reason  they inspire 
inspire what  in this case 
in this  and in every case  power 
say it out loud  whatever it is 
the viceroy of pithom is outside 
he s not on the agenda 
he can go back to pithom until he is 
no  we should deal with this 
bring him in 
if you came here to beg
the new king s forgiveness   
it won t work 
arrest him 
wait  please 
may i at least respond 
i beg you 
it s in your interest 
 you make it short 
 i will   
to the king alone 
my advice is that   
he  and the other generals 
also leave the room 
really 
that s your advice 
you are not his advisor 
that s right  you are 
that s right 
moses 
moses 
everybody but the viceroy   
out 
terrible news 
there you are 
so   
the viceroy 
you didn t arrest him 
you didn t take
your chief advisor s advice 
no  he came 
he told me of an incident
involving two guards   
one of which survived the attack 
and i told him i did not care 
and then  he told me the most
unbelievable story 
told to him  he said 
by very reliable sources 
then  when pressed   
he admitted that they were hebrew spies 
you know what i m talking about 
yes 
and what do you make of it 
i think it s offensive 
and i think it s ridiculous 
yes  yes 
you  of all people  a hebrew 
and i said   
how can i believe such a story 
cousin   
you can t 
what if i take the chance
of not believing it  moses 
what am i to do 
bithia 
mother 
the man is a thief 
my son discovers this 
not you 
and he reports it to your father 
who would have hanged this thief   
if he hadn t been dying himself 
you believe his feeble 
self serving lies 
all i want to know is if it is true 
i didn t ask for a tirade 
to talk about this any longer   
would dignify it   
 and i won t do that 
 answer the question 
yes or no 
was i talking to you 
bring her in  bring her in 
now 
miriam 
come  sit down 
now  i m going to ask you some things   
that are going to seem
very strange to you 
i just would like you
to answer them truthfully 
how do you know moses 
you know how i know him   
and you 
i helped raise you both 
so you are not his sister  then 
of course not 
and you re not a hebrew 
no 
place your arm on the table 
ramses  
don t be stupid 
i am not talking to you 
i am talking to her 
your whole arm on the table  miriam 
thank you 
ramses   
don t take this any further 
don t take this any further  or what 
do not take this any further 
are you quite sure about that 
get your hand off it  or use it  now 
or perhaps you d like to answer
the question 
then i ll proceed 
miriam  i m going to ask you again   
and if your answer is again no   
i apologize for what happens next 
are you his sister 
no 
yes 
yes 
you don t need a reason to kill him 
but you have one 
 this was treason 
 how was it treason 
he just admitted he knew 
that wasn t an admission 
simply did not want her arm lopped off 
i saw it in his eyes 
he does not believe this story 
i don t want to believe it 
you want to believe it  because it s an
opportunity to be rid of him   
which you always wanted 
i didn t say  exiled   i said  dead  
that  i m sure  will follow   
where he s going 
khyan   
allow me to talk to my mother 
yes  sir  yes 
come  miriam 
it isn t every man who would protect a
servant who s nothing more to him than that 
certainly no one else in this family   
including me 
i wouldn t have said
what he wanted to hear 
and neither would she 
that s how much we love you 
 we  
it s not true 
it is true 
you were wearing this
when i brought you to the river 
i took it off you for obvious reasons 
that s you 
the connection between you
and our mother 
your sister saved your life 
now you saved hers   
moshe 
miriam 
sorry  sir 
moses 
moses 
i have nothing to steal 
my horse is dead 
we re not here for your horse  moshe 
a little bit higher 
what are you doing 
don t stop  keep working 
you  get water for our goats 
you 
wait your turn 
move your animals away from the troughs 
it s yours again 
where are you from 
west of here 
where are you going 
east 
what did you do 
what do you mean 
you committed some crime 
with respect   
your daughters invited me for some food 
they did not tell me
there would be an interrogation 
i m sorry 
i m just curious 
you are welcome to get cleaned up
before dinner   
if that appeals to you   
and stay the night if you want   
before continuing on   
to wherever it is 
thank you 
describe memphis to someone   
who s never been there and never will 
it s   
i don t want to say  civilized    
because i don t want to offend 
but it is civilized 
there s more there than sheep and goats 
there s more here than that 
really  where 
i m sorry  that was rude 
that was rude 
i m not ignorant
just because i live here 
i can see that 
i can tell you one thing 
this is by far   
the nicest place   
between here and there 
and so you re leaving 
of course 
there s nothing here
for someone like me 
when 
today 
remember this moment in time   
for after these vows   
you shall say to the world   
 this is my husband    this is my wife  
i  zipporah   
i  moses   
 accept you  zipporah   
 accept you  moses   
to be no other than yourself 
loving what i know of you   
trusting what i do not yet know

and faith   
in your abiding love for me 
in all that life may bring us   
i pledge my love 
i pledge my love

where would you rather be 
nowhere 
and when will you leave me 
never

i said  per se  
i don t want to discuss my tomb  per se 
i want to discuss why you seem to want
to discuss it all the time 
respectfully   
it should have been your first
construction order on taking the throne 
it ll be a big project 
as you might imagine 
so is my house  apparently 
is there a problem with the palace 
it s not done 
it won t be long now 
you said that months ago 
meanwhile i m living there like

you re confusing him 
i m not trying to 
is it good for our boy to grow up

believing in yourself 
 it s my faith 
 i know 
 and it s his  too 
 i understand 
he can make up his mind when he s older 
 yes

moshe

or think you saw afterwards

 it was not a storm 
 fine  fine 
the storm was something 
it was something else 
 but the boy was all in your head

keep your eye on the horse 
 thank you 
 welcome back  brother 
aaron   
your brother 
ithamar 
ithamar  this   
is your famous uncle moses 
he was once a prince of egypt 
i m fine 
everybody s fine 
you sleep so well  my boy   
because you know you are loved 
i ve never slept so well 
i m told i should address you   
as ramses the great  now 
moses   
you re alive 
 i m glad you re alive 
 really 
is that why you only sent
two assassins to kill me 
my mother 
 don t blame her 
 yes  she wanted you dead 
who do you think hid your sword
where you would find it 
moses 
i m not here   
to take your throne 
it s not about the prophecy
that worries you so much 
this is something else 
i have been told   
that things here have become   
much worse 
things are better than
they ever have been  moses 
no 
 we have order 
 order 
the slaves   
their bodies burn night and day now 
i ve seen it with my own eyes 
you call that order 
they re slaves 
 no  they re not 
 what would you expect 
they re egyptians 
they should be treated as egyptians 
they should have the same rights   
they should be paid for their work   
or you must set them free 
they are not egyptians 
they are slaves  moses 
what else do you expect 
they wouldn t know what to do   
if all of a sudden they were left
to fend for themselves like animals 
do not call them animals 
listen 
from an economic standpoint alone   
what you re asking   
is problematic to say the least 
i didn t expect to hear a simple yes 
but i do not want to hear a simple no 
is that what you are telling me 
are you saying no 
i m not saying no 
i m saying time 
time 
you re listening to hebrews 
i m not listening to hebrews 
who are you talking to 
god 
god 
which god 
you re not seriously
considering his proposal 
is it a proposal 
if a man is holding a dagger
to your throat  minister 
 is it 
 i stand corrected 
that s a demand 
he has lost his mind 
he s found a god  his god 
not one of ours   
so i would like moses   
i want moses dead 
did you hear me 
yes 
then  go 
and   
his family  too 
moses 
where s moses 
moses  where s moses 
moses   
his family 
where are they 
this is not moses 
this is not his family 
this is a man   
his wife   
and his child   
who when asked the simple question 
 where is he     
answered   we don t know  
carry this image home with you tonight   
and discuss why you would protect him   
knowing that tomorrow at this time   
there will be another family   
where this one is 
and another the day after 
and the day after that 
dare i say yours 
go ahead 
i want to join the fight 
in there 
joshua  use your knee 
it s good 
both eyes open 
nock  draw 
loose 
advance 
nock  draw 
loose 
draw 
loose 
draw 
loose 
again 
there are two kinds of warfare 
each is dictated by numbers 
with greater numbers   
you attack the enemy head on 
you stab it in the heart 
with fewer numbers 
you come at it from the side 
you cut off the blood   
that pumps the heart 
the army supply lines 
no 
the people s supply lines 
their food   
their property   
their comfort 
what would that achieve 
everything 
only the egyptian people   
can force him
to accept our demands   
for freedom  we must force them   
to make him say yes 
yes 
yes 
yes 
yes 
with me 
with me 
ready 
you re not going to do anything 
i didn t say that 
where have you been 
watching you fail 
wars of attrition take time 
at this rate  you ll take years   
a generation 
i am prepared to fight for that long 
i m not 
i thought we were making progress 
now  you re impatient 
after 400 years of slavery 
am i the only one sitting here
who s done nothing about this until now 
i do know   
a few things about military action 
still  if you re not going
to listen to me   
then why did you take me away   
from my family 
i didn t 
you did 
you don t need me 
maybe not 
so what do i do  nothing 
for now   
you can watch 
divine goddess kebechet 
i humbly call upon you   
to purify the waters
of our life giving river 
how long will it take 
not long 
but longer than that 
ramses  ramses 
yes 
enough 
do something 
they re just frogs 
back away  back away 
unclean 
no  no  no  don t drink 
unclean 
the nile  as we know 
carries a certain amount of clay 
this year there s much more of it
than usual   
drifting in on the currents 
settling on the riverbeds   
and kicked up by the wild thrashing
of the crocodiles 
this thrashing not only   
dramatically changed the color of the water 
but it fouled it   
to the point of killing the fish 
but frogs  as we know   
can get out of the water 
when they have to 
which they did 
but frogs still need water   
and when they can t find it
in the streets of our city   
they what 
they die 
they die 
and then they decompose 
and then the gnats come
and the maggots come and the flies come 
and then   
and then what 
the flies die 
speak up 
it s in hebrew 
hebrew 
read it 
 these catastrophes   
 are the work of god   
 and they have not finished 
they will get worse 
 we need to reach a settlement   
 for both our sakes  
so  the work of god 
here is my settlement to you 
work quotas shall be doubled   
and you will get no straw   
to make your bricks 
perhaps your god   
will provide it for you 
i was impressed at first 
not anymore 
this is affecting everyone 
so  who are you punishing 
what s wrong with him 
it s sick 
what is this 
 did you do this 
 not me 
 is this you 
 no  no 
what s happened to him 
we have made great strides in medicine 
however  there are still a few hidden diseases
that we don t completely understand 
animals are not exempt   
and there is some conjecture   
that these maladies can migrate
from the smallest creature 
like a   
a fly 
have you been out to the river lately 
i appealed to kebechet again   
and six more gods 
is that it 
are you done 
i am 
are you trying to say something
with your absence 
is it meant to humble me 
because it will not 
initial reports suggest   
more than 10 million square cubits
of crops have been lost 
the quartermaster has suggested
we return a portion   
of the supplement to the civil granary 
an act of mercy 
your people are starving 
are you suggesting
that i should starve  too 
no 
people have plenty of water 
they will endure 
aim 
fire 
aim 
fire 
is that you 
moses 
brother 
have you come to negotiate 
because i m ready   
as i have an offer for you 
one more thing happens   
and i will bring my own plague to you 
you see  every hebrew child   
not yet walking   
they never shall 
because i will drown them in the nile 
as you should have been 
you say that you didn t cause all this 
your god did 
i am the god  i am the god 
so  let s just see
who s more effective at killing 
you 
this god 
or me 
nice of you to come 
he s given you what you asked 
not yet  but his own people
are turning against him 
 and his army 
 it will 
i disagree 
something worse has to happen 
i disagree 
 anything more would be   
 would be what 
what were you about to say 
cruel  inhumane 
it s not easy to see   
the people who i grew up with
suffering this much 
what about the people you
didn t grow up with 
what thought did you give to them 
you still don t think of them
as yours  do you 
as long as ramses
has an army behind him   
nothing will change 
anything more is just revenge 
revenge 
after 400 years of brutal subjugation 
these pharaohs who imagine they re living gods 
they re nothing more than flesh and blood 
i want to see them on their knees 
begging for it to stop 
i m tired of talking with a messenger 
general 
i have heard ramses  final threat 
so  let me tell you
what s going to happen next 
no  no 
you cannot do this 
i want no part of this 
stay 
 hold 
 moses 
leave him 
 khyan 
 moses 
i could have you killed 
i don t think so 
unless you do it yourself 
your own soldiers let me in 
i am not negotiating anymore 
that s not why i m here 
i came to tell you
that something is coming   
that is out of my control 
something that will affect thousands   
and thousands of citizens 
and it will affect you very personally
unless you accept what i ve asked for   
and announce it publicly   
before the sun goes down 
ramses   
do not turn your back on me 
this has nothing to do with you and i 
this is far beyond that 
this is about egypt s survival 
do you understand 
sunset 
after that  it will be too late 
what will be too late 
you protect your child 
you protect your child tonight 
my child 
is that a threat 
is that a threat  moses 
moses 
tell everyone   
to slaughter a lamb   
and mark their doors   
and their doorposts tonight   
with its blood 
why 
pity the lambs if i am wrong 
if i m right   
we will bless them for eternity

get   
out 
go 
every one of you 
go 
go to canaan if that s what you want 
back to the homeland of your dreams 
but go 
as you command 
this is the route i took 
from here  we go south to the red sea 
the straits are here 
at low tide  we can cross on foot 
you know why you sleep so well  my boy 
because you know you are loved 
with respect   
if we re going to
recapture 400 000 slaves   
we might need more than three divisions 
we re not recapturing anyone 
forward 
we should rest 
no 
we re not safe until we cross the sea 
moshe 
ramses   
4 000 men   
a thousand chariots 
how far behind us 
four days 
less  if they don t rest the horses 
ramses 
ramses 
we need to rest the horses   
and the men 
the straits are that way 
the longest  easiest route   
is down the western coast 
or we go through the mountains 
the mountains 
why  why don t we take that route 
we can  but so can ramses 
the mountain passes are dangerous   
but they are too narrow
for ramses  chariots 
he couldn t follow 
that would give us needed time 
what does god tell you 
the mountains 
can we make it 
forward 
which way from here 
stay here 
we need your help 
i don t know where i am 
you won t help me 
you won t help them 
this way 
move out 
this way 
are you sure 
i m very sure 
i mean  are you sure we can make it
across with our equipment   
our chariots 
they didn t think they could
with theirs 
how would they know 
they ve never been here 
moses may have 
is this high tide or low tide 
doesn t matter 
this isn t the straits  is it 
no 
do you even know where we are 
yes 
we re at a point on the earth
where there is a sea ahead   
and an army behind 
so now what 
army or no army   
we have to rest 
i have misled all of them 
i have abandoned my family 
i have failed you 
i m not what i thought i was 
what is it 
the current 
it s strong 
we need to cross here 
we need to cross now 
we cross here 
we cross here 
ready yourselves 
we cross here 
go tell them  go 
your orders   
are like the lash of the egyptian whip 
we are no longer slaves 
and yet  you are not free 
you have lost sight   
of canaan   
land of your forebears 
you have honored me   
with your trust 
now i honor you with my faith 
follow me and you will be free 
stay and you will perish 
do not be afraid 
god is with us 
go  ready yourselves 
go 
god is with us 
pass the word  we cross here 
as quickly as you can 
gather your things   
and form in groups 
quickly 
come on 
steady 
to the right  to the right  tight 
keep moving 
there s nothing to fear 
don t worry  you ll be safe 
keep to the right  keep to the right

sit 
my family   
is not far from here 
your family 
my other family  my wife  my son 
i was thinking   
maybe i could convince them   
convince them to join us 
but perhaps that s   
perhaps that s not wise 
of course they should come 
we have a long way to go 
a lot can happen 
and then   
we get there  if we get there 
you don t think they ll
let us settle in canaan 
they ll see us as invaders 
they won t have a choice 
we re as big as any tribe 
we re as big as a nation of tribes
and that concerns me even more 
why 
this many people 
you have to ask 
but we all have the same goal 
we do now 
what happens when we stop running 
ramses   
the great 
thank you 
gershom 
did you do what you said 
what did i say 
that you would trade your faith   
to keep me 
no

who are they 
they re my people 
who makes you happy 
you do 
what is the most important thing
in your life 
you are

when will i leave you 
never 
may i proceed 
proceed 
what do you think of this 
i wouldn t do it   
if i didn t agree 
that s true 
i ve noticed that about you 
you don t always agree with me 
nor you me  i ve noticed 
yet here we are  still speaking 
but not for much longer 
a leader can falter   
but stone
