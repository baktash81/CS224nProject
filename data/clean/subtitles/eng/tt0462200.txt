no sir
look here
what happened up yonder at the house
that wasnt your fault
aint a young man alive
couldve kept his pants on
with that girl in heat like she is
why she got a chain on her
well now thats between me and her
thats private
so
that your first time
yes sir

if she weighed a pound
couldve done a lot better for myself
hell look like you sure enough did
you want a cigarette
no sir
thats usually what you do
when you get through you know
you either smoke
or leave them smoking
you a preacher
thats right
can i ask you a question
you know how people are always
saying you gotta get right with jesus
if you want not to go to hell you know
gotta say youre sorry
and jesus will let you into heaven
you can put it that way
thats so fucking stupid
im sorry im sorry
i dont mean to curse i just
no no no whats on your mind
whats on your mind
you cant go around hurting people
and then just
say youre sorry
and it all gets washed away
why would heaven
want people like that
im gonna tell you something
and its just gonna be
between you and me
i think folks
carry on about heaven too much
like its some kind of
allyoucaneat buffet up in the clouds
and folks just do as theyre told
so they can eat what they want
behind some pearly gates
theres sin in my heart
theres evil in the world
but when i got no one i talk to god
i ask for strength
i ask for forgiveness
not peace at the end of my days
when i got no more life to live
or no more good to do but today
right now
whats your heaven
