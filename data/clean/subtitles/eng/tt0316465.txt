lll be in there directly
okay mama
maam
l was wondering if we might carry
your son tomorrow on the team bus

what your boys done to my son
was wrong
but l dont expect you
to make up for it
the boys are taking to him real good
theyre still boys now aint they
lll keep a good eye on him
l guess its all right with me
l dont mean to pry maam
but l was hoping
l might be able to ask you
what exactly is wrong with him
well the doctors never could
give me a name for it
say he the same as everybody else
just a little slower than most
l got a older boy walter
hes fine and all
and their daddy
he died a while back
lm sorry
you got your hands full
well they got me working 1 0 hours
a day at the hospital some days more
so lm wondering where hes at
half the time
and worrying all the time
because l figure they only gonna need
one excuse to put him away
james is a good boy coach
he got himself a good heart
most folks just dont take the time
to see it is all
james
james robert kennedy
thank you maam
no he is not getting on that bus
harold he is not a student
you dont even know how old he is
look he has a handicap
we know nothing about
what if he has some kind
of a seizure
hes not the one whos
gonna have the seizure
this has nothing to do
with any of that
lf youre saying
lm overly concerned
about my students being with
a severely handicapped black man
l assure you that l am
but my concern is not necessarily
for my students
lm not so sure were trying to help
somebody here
or whether hes being used as
nothing more than a glorified mascot
you know me a hell of a lot
better than that
put your game face on
wipe your smile off your faces
start thinking about football
coach jones lt raining hard
radio radio
gonna be wet out there
lt sure is
listen were not gonna be able
to take you on the bus today
some folks they dont think
its a good idea
they just dont understand yet
but theyll catch on believe me
lm sorry

everythings fine why
a little bird says mr kennedys spent
time with you inside the building
yeah thats correct

as a problem
disrupting a football game
is one thing
disrupting a classroom

well now how long
would you say mr kennedy
well now how long
would you say mr kennedy
has been in
an actual classroom setting
well lets see about a month
and the thinking behind that
he was doing fine with the team
l didnt see any harm in it
mr tucker l know you got a job
to do
but is me having radio in the
classroom really worth all this trouble
thats what the school board
would like to find out
this is a young man whos been
spending his entire lifetime
wandering around all by himself
out on the streets
which is quite different than being
inside a public school right
yeah well thats the point
isnt it
mr tucker
l am well aware of the liability risk
we are running here
harold will be first to tell you my list
of reservations is longer than most
lm sure thats the case
but the fact of the matter is
none of us has any experience
with having a severely retarded man
wandering the halls with our students
the risk is enormous
please keep that in mind
l will
ms daniels
mr jones
thank you mr tucker
well this is a hell of a position

right in your heart all right
were gonna be all right
all right boy come here come here
wheres my mama
hold on just a second
l want to tell you something
something l never told anybody
when l was about 1 2
l had a paper route
crack of dawn every day
wasnt many houses
around here then
so l had to cover quite a lot
of territory
and l used to cut through
the woods on this little dirt road
and one morning l was riding
through there
and l heard this noise
sounded like a rabbit or something
you know caught in a trap
and then l realized it was coming from
one of the houses set back in there
l kind of walked over there
and didnt seem like anybody
was home so l walked on up
lt had you know chicken wire and
barbed wire around the bottom of it
l figure to keep the critters out
you know
and then all of the sudden l saw
these fingers coming through the wire
and l put my bike down
and got down
on my hands and knees
and l looked under there
and there was this boy about my age
l dont know what was wrong
with him something was
they used to keep him under there
and l looked right at him
he looked back at me
we just sat there staring
at each other for a while
l ran that route for two years
mary helen
and l never did a thing
l just wanted you to know that
thanks daddy
how long before he comes back
lm hoping tomorrow
his brother walters moved in
with him
honeycutt says he let loose
on that house pretty good
says hes not the only one
that knows about it either
the man had just lost his
mother lou
l didnt ask why he took a swing at his
wall l asked you if you knew about it
why are you asking me that
our friend from the board is back
he wants to see you
with his mama gone its all different
every bit of it
good luck
ln the last month how much time
has mr kennedy spent alone
during the day at least
mr jones
past few weeks everybodys been
keeping a pretty steady eye on him
so we talking an hour a day
or two
an hour maybe
well it could be a halfhour
well as you may have guessed
the board has received reports of
mr kennedys inconsistent behavior
what kind of reports from who
reports of resisting arrest
tearing up his home
barging into the girls locker room
oh barging
whos been feeding you this crap
lm not here to argue with you
lm not arguing lts a simple question
whos been feeding you this crap
l ask because those were all instances
in which he wasnt being supervised
says who
says who
bottom line with ms kennedy gone
james faces some rough times ahead
to keep him in a school setting
let me tell you something
this school is the reason hes doing
as well as he is
but to keep him in a school setting
you take him out of this school
you may as well take his life
lve compiled a list of care agencies
oh lll bet you have
yes maam l will take care of it
personally
yes l will
yes maam
yes maam
ls that a fact
thats some serious money
well all right yes l will
all right now you too

evening maam
well l had a talk with radio
this morning
l told him in not so many words that
we might be looking at some changes
lt didnt take long to see
the more l talked
the more he didnt understand me
we got a lot of that going on around
when l was playing l had a coach
he used to tell me to keep
my priorities straight
hed say son you figure out whats
important
you push everything else aside
l love football
l love everything about it
l love friday nights when
you look for a win
and saturday morning
when you found one
but thats not whats important
right now
we got ourselves a young man
were not thinking about
the same young man who could
hardly talk when we first met him
and now hes making
announcements over the loudspeaker
same young man who got himself
a football letter last fall
but never wears it because
he cant afford a jacket
now were asking him to leave
harold we are not asking
the mans not done frank
l know some of you dont know
or dont care
about all that radios learned
over these past few months
well the truth is
were not the ones
whove been teaching radio
radios the one been teaching us
the way he treats us all the time
is the way we wish we treated
each other even part of the time
l know somethings gotta happen here
l know some changes gotta be made
and l know l cant let what happened
last season happen again
so lve decided to step down
as head football coach
see what youve done frank
ld like to keep teaching
if thats all right
lll keep an eye on radio
make sure he stays out of trouble
and ld like to spend more time
with a few other folks
lve neglected over the years
while l still have a chance to
much as l love this game its not
half as important as setting that right
that was a pretty good cup del
thank yall
good night
this what you wanted
ls this worth it
that was a crazy idea
werent expecting that were you

coaching football
