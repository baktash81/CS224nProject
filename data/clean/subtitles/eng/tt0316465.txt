radio 
hi  everybody  hi  everybody 
hi  everybody 
quite a show you put on tonight 
just wondering if you were running
a football program or a social club 
radio  l need to talk to your mama 
that okay 
she right there 
 hi  mama 
 there s a sandwich in there for you 
 l ll be in there directly 
 okay  mama 
ma am 
l was wondering if we might carry
your son tomorrow on the team bus 
got us a football game 
what your boys done to my son
was wrong   
   but l don t expect you
to make up for it 
the boys are taking to him real good 
they re still boys  now  ain t they 
l ll keep a good eye on him 
l guess it s all right with me 
l don t mean to pry  ma am   
   but l was hoping   
   l might be able to ask you
what exactly is wrong with him 
well  the doctors never could
give me a name for it 
say he the same as everybody else 
just a little slower than most 
l got a older boy  walter 
he s fine and all 
and their daddy 
he died a while back 
l m sorry 
you got your hands full 
well  they got me working 1 0 hours
a day at the hospital  some days more 
so l m wondering where he s at
half the time   
   and worrying all the time 
because l figure they only gonna need
one excuse to put him away 
james is a good boy  coach 
he got himself a good heart 
most folks just don t take the time
to see it  is all 
james 
james robert kennedy 
thank you  ma am 
no  he is not getting on that bus 
harold  he is not a student 
you don t even know how old he is 
look  he has a handicap
we know nothing about 
what if he has some kind
of a seizure 
he s not the one who s
gonna have the seizure 
this has nothing to do
with any of that 
lf you re saying
l m overly concerned   
   about my students being with
a severely handicapped black man   
   l assure you that l am 
but my concern is not necessarily
for my students 
l m not so sure we re trying to help
somebody here   
   or whether he s being used as
nothing more than a glorified mascot 
you know me a hell of a lot
better than that 
put your game face on 
wipe your smile off your faces 
start thinking about football 
 coach jones  lt raining hard 
 radio  radio 
 gonna be wet out there 
 lt sure is 
listen  we re not gonna be able
to take you on the bus today 
some folks  they don t think
it s a good idea 
they just don t understand yet 
but they ll catch on  believe me 
l m sorry 
l m really sorry 
l ll see you tomorrow  okay 
and in local sports

   salvage a measure of pride
for the home squad

the offense moving 
 he sure did 
 he sure did  coach 
l m real proud of all the boys 
always good to beat westside 
and it s nice to win the last one 
wasn t long ago
we were winning most every one

to be losing half our games 
anybody else 
lt s all right  you can speak up

say anything  l sure as hell will 
you got yourself a distraction

what do you think 
l think that one s up to you

the new york post has been sold to
australian publisher rupert murdoch 
 morning  girls 
 morning 
free agent reggie jackson signed
a five year deal   
   to play with the new york yankees 
 hi  nicole 
 hi 
coach jones 
 good morning  lou 
 good morning 
what brings you around here 
seeing as you never drop by my office 
l thought l d pop up for a visit 
 and how is everything 
 everything s fine  why 
a little bird says mr  kennedy s spent
time with you inside the building 
yeah  that s correct 
do you see that
as a problem 
disrupting a football game
is one thing 
disrupting a classroom
is a different matter 
l want him with you all the time 
okay 
yes  ma am 
  l o 
  radio   
and that s how you spell it 
here  you want to try it 
you want to do it 
look  lt s easy  you just take
the chalk and it writes right on there 
all right  well  we don t
have to do it right now 
radio 
blueberry and pumpkin today 
pie  not cobbler 
both 
coach jones  you re needed
in the office 
all right  everybody 
just keep working 
radio  keep everybody under control
while l m gone  now 
keep an eye on everything 
no talking  no talking 
no talking  no  
well  now  how long
would you say mr  kennedy   
well  now  how long
would you say mr  kennedy   
   has been in
an actual classroom setting 
well  let s see  about a month 
and the thinking behind that 
he was doing fine with the team 
l didn t see any harm in it 
mr  tucker  l know you got a job
to do   
   but is me having radio in the
classroom really worth all this trouble 
that s what the school board
would like to find out 
this is a young man who s been
spending his entire lifetime   
   wandering around all by himself
out on the streets 
which is quite different than being
inside a public school  right 
yeah  well  that s the point 
isn t it 
mr  tucker   
   l am well aware of the liability risk
we are running here 
harold will be first to tell you  my list
of reservations is longer than most 
l m sure that s the case 
but the fact of the matter is 
none of us has any experience   
   with having a severely retarded man
wandering the halls with our students 
the risk is enormous 
 please keep that in mind 
 l will 
ms  daniels 
 mr  jones 
 thank you  mr  tucker 
well  this is a hell of a position
you ve put me in 
yeah  l suppose it is  lou 
but radio s not gonna do anything 
harold 
why on earth are you doing this

we re gonna be all right 
all right  boy  come here  come here 
where s my mama 
hold on just a second 
l want to tell you something 
something l never told anybody 
when l was about 1 2 
l had a paper route 
crack of dawn every day 
wasn t many houses
around here then   
   so l had to cover quite a lot
of territory   
   and l used to cut through
the woods on this little dirt road 
and one morning  l was riding
through there   
   and l heard this noise 
sounded like a rabbit or something 
you know  caught in a trap 
and then l realized it was coming from
one of the houses set back in there 
l kind of walked over there   
   and didn t seem like anybody
was home  so l walked on up 
lt had  you know  chicken wire and
barbed wire around the bottom of it 
l figure to keep the critters out 
you know 
and then all of the sudden  l saw
these fingers coming through the wire 
and l put my bike down   
   and got down
on my hands and knees   
   and l looked under there 
and there was this boy about my age 
l don t know what was wrong
with him  something was 
they used to keep him under there 
and l looked right at him 
he looked back at me 
we just sat there staring
at each other for a while 
l ran that route for two years 
mary helen 
and l never did a thing 
l just wanted you to know that 
thanks  daddy 
 how long before he comes back 
 l m hoping tomorrow 
his brother walter s moved in
with him 
honeycutt says he let loose
on that house pretty good 
says he s not the only one
that knows about it either 
the man had just lost his
mother  lou 
l didn t ask why he took a swing at his
wall  l asked you if you knew about it 
why are you asking me that 
our friend from the board is back 
he wants to see you 
with his mama gone  it s all different 
every bit of it 
good luck 
ln the last month  how much time
has mr  kennedy spent alone 
during the day at least 
mr  jones 
past few weeks  everybody s been
keeping a pretty steady eye on him 
so we talking an hour a day 
or two 
an hour  maybe 
well  it could be a half hour 
well  as you may have guessed   
   the board has received reports of
mr  kennedy s inconsistent behavior 
what kind of reports  from who 
reports of resisting arrest   
   tearing up his home 
barging into the girls  locker room 
oh  barging 
 who s been feeding you this crap 
 l m not here to argue with you 
l m not arguing  lt s a simple question 
who s been feeding you this crap 
l ask because those were all instances
in which he wasn t being supervised 
says who 
says who 
bottom line  with ms  kennedy gone 
james faces some rough times ahead 
 to keep him in a school setting  
 let me tell you something 
this school is the reason he s doing
as well as he is 
but to keep him in a school setting  
you take him out of this school 
you may as well take his life 
 l ve compiled a list of care agencies 
 oh  l ll bet you have 
yes  ma am  l will take care of it
personally 
yes  l will 
yes  ma am 
yes  ma am 
ls that a fact 
that s some serious money 
well  all right  yes  l will 
all right  now  you too 
 harold 
 hello  frank

we might be looking at some changes 
lt didn t take long to see
the more l talked   
   the more he didn t understand me 
we got a lot of that going on around 
when l was playing  l had a coach   
   he used to tell me to keep
my priorities straight 
he d say    son  you figure out what s
important 
you push everything else aside   
l love football 
l love everything about it 
l love friday nights when
you look for a win   
   and saturday morning
when you found one 
but that s not what s important
right now 
we got ourselves a young man
we re not thinking about 
the same young man who could
hardly talk when we first met him   
   and now he s making
announcements over the loudspeaker 
same young man who got himself
a football letter last fall   
   but never wears it  because
he can t afford a jacket 
now we re asking him to leave 
 harold  we are not asking  
 the man s not done  frank 
l know some of you don t know
or don t care
