leonard 
to the naked eye 
a suit appears to consist
of two parts 
a jacket and trousers 
but those two
seemingly solid parts
are composed of
four different fabrics 
cotton  silk  mohair and wool 
and those four fabrics are
cut into 38 separate pieces 
the process of sizing  forming 
conjoining those pieces
requires no fewer than
228 steps 
 teakettle whistling 
so the first step
is measurement 
but  measurement  doesn t mean 
uh  just reaching for your tape 
 so many inches here 
so many inches there  
no  no  no 
you cannot make something good
until you understand
who you re making it for 
 bell jingles 
all clothing says something 
i ve had gentlemen
walk into my shop and boast 
 oh  i don t care about
what i wear  
and assuming that s true 
doesn t that say something  too 
so  who is your customer 
and what are you trying to say
about him 
a man walks through your door 
what about him can you observe 
   bell jingles 
  good morning 
leonard 
is he timid 
hunched over
like a midday clock 
or does he stand
with confidence 
spine at six and twelve 
is this a man
of springtime pastel 
clamoring to be noticed 
or is this a man
of gray and brown 
blending into the hurried crowd 
is this a man comfortable
in his station 
 bell jingles 
or does he pine
for grander things 
and who would this man
like to be 
and who is he underneath 
 jingles 
take your measure   
   and when you understand
who he is   
 jingles 
mr  boyle

those men may be customers

i ve spent my entire life
around animals
like richie boyle 
you want to get him to back off

came to you in a bad moment 
you were a stand up guy 
water 
sure 
yeah 
 exhales painfully 
 sighs  where s francis 
he  he said he had to find a way
  to play your tape 
   water running 
what do you mean  he left 
uh  something about how playing
the tape would tell him  uh 
who the rat is 
that s what you call it 
isn t it 
  a rat 
  hmm 
francis told you that 
mm 
he s just not usually
the type to get blabby 
well  it sounds like
it s been a long night 
  for us all 
  yeah 
s slowly with that 
i got it 
who would do such a thing
to your family 
after everything your father s
done for this neighborhood 
my pops is
this fucking neighborhood 
indeed 
when i first came to chicago 
all i had to me name
was a set of shears 
your father  did you know
he was my very first customer 
very first 
yeah  i remember that 
  do you 
  yeah 
pops was excited 
he  uh   
 chuckles softly 
came home one day
saying  you know 
 there s a new tailor in town  
  did he 
  yeah   right from england  
 both chuckle 
it was a very warm welcome 
i tell you 
yeah 
much appreciated 
 clears throat 
pops loves all that
fancy stuff  you know 
  he does  he s got good taste 
  mm hmm 
you know that he   
he taught me how to tie a tie
for the first time
when i was four 
  no 
  mm hmm 
four 
what was he always saying  uh   
 a well tied tie is the  uh 
first serious step
in life  kid  
some shit like that 
  wilde 
  mm  fucking crazy  right 
no  that s a quote 
oscar wilde 
yeah  i don t know him 
 sniffs 
but see  that s probably why
my pops likes you  though 
you know  he s into all that
quoting fancy people shit 
 chuckles softly 
so  who do you think it is 
who do i think is who 
this judas
who s betrayed your family 
i don t know 
i ll wager
a clever young man like yourself
must have some suspicions 
someone close to the family 
perhaps  but  but not family 
i have something i need
to tell you  master richie 
okay 
i feel terrible 
i i never imagined
things would get
so out of control 
that anyone would be harmed 
much less yourself 
or    or  god forbid 
your father 
but   
the fuck are you
talking about  english 
i    i have to tell   
i have to tell you   
spit it out 
i m the rat 
i ve been selling information
to your enemies 
and i let the federal bureau
of investigation
plant their bug    here 
 laughing 
holy shit  you had me 
you fucking had me 
 both laughing 
i almost fucking shot you 
 laughing  
i felt it 
i made you laugh 
it s a hell of a thing
to joke about   laughing 
well  it s the best medicine 
you know 
it is 
can you imagine  huh 
you    the rat 
 laughing 
wait a minute 
what do you mean by that 
 inhales sharply 
what do you mean 
what do i mean 
you couldn t be the rat 
i absolutely could be the rat 
  not a chance 
  why not 
why   cause look at you 
what about me 
 laughs 
nah  uh uh 
you re just a fucking tailor 
 sniffs 
i m not a tailor 
i m a cutter 
  sorry 
  a tailor sews on buttons
and hems trousers 
anyone with a needle and thread
and 15 minutes can be a tailor 
i studied for decades
to be a cutter 
i used to cut on the row 
  fuck is  the row  
  savile row 
where s that  north addison 
it s in london 
a quarter of a mile in which
the greatest craftsmen
in the world
all ply their trade 
i apprenticed there for years
before they allowed me   
   to open my own shop 
  why d you come here  then 
  the war 
what  krauts bomb your place 
worse 
they re called blue jeans 
 stifled laugh 
   coughs 
  after the war 
things were quite poor
in england 
not a lot of men
could afford well made things 
so these blue jeans
became all the rage 
well  times change  pal 
blue jeans are the fashion now 
this james dean of yours
makes one picture
and blue jeans are the fashion 
soon he ll make another 
something else
will become popular 
these fashionable things 
they don t last 
the things i make 
  like that suit of yours   
  mm 
   it s timeless 
so you thought that a bunch
of fancy pants in england
couldn t appreciate
the finer things 
so you came to chicago 
wow  you must fucking
love red hots 
i came to a place
that isn t weighed down   
   with bitter history 
and  yes 
  red hots are delicious 
   chuckles 
 laughs 
i do hope
your cousin s all right 
my cousin 
 doorbell ringing

my pops can see the
mangiest mutt on the street 
and if he s got teeth
sharp enough 
he ll be eating with us
at the dinner table 
he s lost a lot of blood 
he s probably light in the head 
 sighs 
where did francis say
he was going exactly 
oh  no  you can t think
he has anything to do with this 
it s not my place to speak ill
of master richie 
but he keeps going on about
this rat you mentioned 
what about the rat 
he said before  he was the one
looking for the rat 
why would he place himself
in charge of looking for the rat
if he was the rat himself 
so he told you all that 
but he didn t tell you
where he was going 
 i know who the rat is  
he says 
 francis thinks
he can pull one over on me  
  who  me 
  well 
he keeps fiddling
with your briefcase 
  what did he do to the case 
  nothing 
he left the case in there 
if i was the rat   
   and try as i might 
i can t seem to convince you
that i am   
 chuckles 
   well  i d want to burn
that thing straightaway

that separates
man from monkeys is tools 
do you believe all that 
evolution 
i don t know 
but i do know that a man
has a choice in this world
about how he uses his tools 
he can destroy or he can build 
and you think i destroy 
but  no  with this 
i ve built loyalty 
i have built a crew 
i ve built a neighborhood 
and the men i ve had to kill   
   well  you have to toss away
a few scraps  don t you 
when you re cutting
a pair of pants

the underworld united nations 
anybody messes with anybody

i wouldn t be shocked right now 
all right 
all right 
belts and suspenders 
 mable sighs 
make sure they don t go nowhere 
 door opens  bell jingles 
 wind howling 
 sniffs 
 vehicle doors open  close 
   engine starts 
   mable sniffles 
 vehicle driving away 
 panting softly 
you want to tell me
who the fuck you just talked to
on that phone 
that was one of mr  boyle s men
calling to say
he d yet to hear from richie 
hmm 
wait  wait  wait  wait  wait 
either i kill her now
and we pin tonight
on her corpse   
   or i kill both of you
and do it all myself 
it s  it s your choice 
you need her assistance 
with what do i need
her assistance 
roy boyle is about to walk
directly into an ambush 
  who s ambushing him 
  the la fontaines 
and how exactly
are the la fontaines
gonna know where to ambush him 
because mable s
about to tell them 
  me 
  yes  you 
  why me 
  because you re the rat 
you ve been sleeping
with richie boyle 
you kept hearing him talk about
his father s escalating war
with the la fontaines
and you saw your chance 
you sold information
to la fontaine
so that you could finally
get out of chicago 
but francis   
francis is paranoid 
sooner or later  you thought
he would have found you out 
so you helped the fbi
to plant a bug 
if the fbi could take down
the boyle crew 
you could get away clean 
but you didn t plan
for one thing 
the outfit 
they told the boyles
about the bug 
richie told you 
what could you do 
you told la fontaine 
and hoped that they would
all kill each other   
   before they found you 
you got your hustle 
i got mine 
you were  you were
the fucking rat 
i ve spent my entire life
watching you leeches
suck this neighborhood dry 
i am gonna love   
sitting in a café in paris 
reading all about your funeral 
you stole the tape 
no  that was me 
you knew what i was doing 
and instead of stopping me 
you helped 
  yes 
  fuck you 
i can take care of myself 
if she doesn t call
the la fontaines in the next   
   two minutes  i d say 
roy boyle will return 
having failed to find his son 
eventually 
he ll discover richie 
and then he ll kill all of us 
or mable can tell
the la fontaines
where to ambush him
and offer to sell them the tape 
now tell me 
if roy boyle and all his
senior lieutenants die tonight 
who will be in charge
of his organization 
i took six bullets for that man 
and how many has he taken
for you 
he made me everything
that i am today 
and today is the day
that you don t need him anymore 
you think i m just gonna
betray roy boyle that easy 
no  i don t think it s easy 
i think option a is  we all die 
and option b is 
you run the boyle organization 
make the goddamn call 
i m not here 
 phone dialing 
mable 
bonsoir   clears throat 
 mable speaking french 
   stetson 
stetson 
yes  um     clears throat 
 continues speaking french 
   roy boyle   
 continues speaking french 
   halsted 
 continues speaking french 
   la fontaine   
 continues speaking french 
 hangs up receiver 
la fontaine wants
to make a deal

 gasps 
 lid creaks shut 
 vehicle approaching 
francis 
that s la fontaine 
i m gonna hide in the back 
as soon as you peep the green 
you toss me a signal

this is a stupid fucking idea 
you don t toss me a signal 
i m gonna come out firing
indiscriminate like 
when la fontaine dies tonight 
i m not only leading our crew 
i m leading them
into the outfit 
it s the least i could do 
for roy 
 doorbell ringing

some other time 
la fontaine 
you know what makes me mad 
i ve been running numbers
in this city my whole life 
but nobody said a thing 
cops  racket boys 
nobody even noticed 
until the second
we started making real money 
mon dieu  this fucking city 
since day one  people like me 
people like our english friend 
we come here and we make
something of ourselves 
and then right as soon
as we get big enough 
you connards show up
with your hair slicked back 
shoes all shiny 
and you snatch it away 
like a spoiled child
who d rather break his own toys
than watch somebody else
play with them 
so i will admit to a   
satisfaction earlier
at 31st and halsted
when i put a gun
to roy boyle s head
and watched him die
as he d lived 
sorry he ever met me 
leonard 
madame 
you have nothing to fear
from this man 
why is that 
because earlier this evening 
i removed all the bullets
from his gun 
 francis groans quietly 
any other killers in here
i should know about 
leonard 
only you 
a tailor 
always listening  never talking 
but nobody stop to think 
 what s going on in his head  
i m not a tailor  ma am 
i m a cutter 
un coupeur 
au revoir 
 exhales slowly 
mm 
they ll find us out 
the boyles are all dead 
the outfit  then 
why would the outfit
come looking for us 
because we took the tape
that everyone is loo   
leonard 
to the naked eye 
a suit appears
to consist of two parts   
the tape 
   a jacket and trousers 
it s just a fake 
but these two
seemingly solid parts
are composed of
four different fabrics 
mable  the outfit has never even
heard of roy boyle 
they didn t send those messages 
you did 
you ve been planning this
for months 
everything that happened 
you set it all up 
this contains everything
that went on here this evening 
enough to convict
any remaining boyles
of a dozen crimes
and madame la fontaine
of the murder of roy boyle 
you won t mind  will you 
popping it in the post
to your friend at the fbi 
on your way to   
 chuckles softly 
perhaps it s safest if   
   i don t know 
but make it somewhere grand 
so what about you 
oh  i ve started over before 
it ll be easier the second time 
  come with me 
  no 
no  come with me 
you can show me things
you ve already seen 
you will not spend
your best years
taking care of my remaining few 
mable  i was taking care of
myself just fine  you know 
leonard 
oh  yes 
knowing you  i m quite confident
you d have seen to the burials
of each and every one
of those murderers 
but then   
you d no longer be pretending
to be one 
would you 
i wish i could have met her 
your real   
you know 
 chuckles softly 
she would have liked you 
 mable sniffles 
 bell jingles 
 door closes 
leonard  finishings  for me 
can be the hardest part 
not because there s
any great skill involved
in these final steps   
   putting on a few buttons 
closing up a few edges 
but because
if you ve done your job 
all the true craftsmanship
has already occurred 
the finishings are
mere inevitabilities 
it s at the finishings
that you must come to terms
with the idea
that perfection
is a necessary goal   
   precisely because
it is unattainable 
if you don t aim for perfection 
you cannot make anything great 
and yet  true perfection
is impossible 
 flames whooshing 
 cries out 
 groaning 
 grunting 
   gun clicking 
   gasps 
oh 
oh  no 
 grunting 
 groaning 
francis 
stop 
 panting 
 clatters 
leonard 
so at the finish 
you must reconcile yourself   
   to failure 
i was like you once 
   grunts 
  i was 
 chuckles quietly 
made my living with a gun 
a knife 
sometimes   
   just my bare hands 
i d   
i d a gift  they said 
but it wasn t magic 
it was work 
one day  they asked me to do
something i couldn t do 
so i ran  i hid 
i hid on the row 
picked up a trade 
learnt a craft  and met my wife 
vera 
i fell in love 
we had little lily 
i fell in love again 
but they found me 
they found me 
set fire to my shop 
my home 
my life 
i came here to get away
from all that violence 
get away from myself 
 chuckles 
m my first day here 
who did i meet 
huh 
i suppose i put  put on
these clothes
to convince myself
i m civilized 
i want so bad to be good 
 chuckles 
 grunting 
 gasping 
 gasps 
 francis gurgling 
 gasping 
 panting softly 
 flames crackling 
 whooshing  crackling 
leonard 
it s not perfect 
you have to make your peace
with that 
 bell jingles 
how 
well
