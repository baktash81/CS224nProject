to the naked eye
a suit appears to consist
of two parts
a jacket and trousers
but those two
seemingly solid parts
are composed of
four different fabrics
cotton silk mohair and wool
and those four fabrics are
cut into 38 separate pieces
the process of sizing forming
conjoining those pieces
requires no fewer than
228 steps
teakettle whistling
so the first step
is measurement
but measurement doesnt mean
uh just reaching for your tape
so many inches here
so many inches there
no no no
you cannot make something good
until you understand
who youre making it for
bell jingles
all clothing says something
ive had gentlemen
walk into my shop and boast
oh i dont care about
what i wear
and assuming thats true
doesnt that say something too
so who is your customer
and what are you trying to say
about him
a man walks through your door
what about him can you observe
bell jingles
good morning
leonard
is he timid
hunched over
like a midday clock
or does he stand
with confidence
spine at six and twelve
is this a man
of springtime pastel
clamoring to be noticed
or is this a man
of gray and brown
blending into the hurried crowd
is this a man comfortable
in his station
bell jingles
or does he pine
for grander things
and who would this man
like to be
and who is he underneath
jingles
take your measure
and when you understand
who he is
jingles
mr boyle
leonard

hmm
francis told you that
mm
hes just not usually
the type to get blabby
well it sounds like
its been a long night
for us all

sslowly with that
i got it
who would do such a thing
to your family
after everything your fathers
done for this neighborhood
my pops is
this fucking neighborhood
indeed
when i first came to chicago
all i had to me name
was a set of shears
your father did you know
he was my very first customer
very first
yeah i remember that
do you
yeah
pops was excited
he uh
chuckles softly
came home one day
saying you know
theres a new tailor in town

he taught me how to tie a tie

wilde

oscar wilde
yeah i dont know him
sniffs
but see thats probably why
my pops likes you though
you know hes into all that
quoting fancy people shit
chuckles softly
so who do you think it is
who do i think is who
this judas
whos betrayed your family
i dont know
ill wager
a clever young man like yourself
must have some suspicions
someone close to the family
perhaps but but not family
i have something i need
to tell you master richie
okay
i feel terrible
ii never imagined
things would get
so out of control
that anyone would be harmed
much less yourself
or or god forbid
your father
but
the fuck are you
talking about english
i i have to tell
i have to tell you
spit it out
im the rat
ive been selling information
to your enemies
and i let the federal bureau
of investigation
plant their bug here

laughing
i felt it
i made you laugh
its a hell of a thing
to joke about laughing
well its the best medicine
you know
it is
can you imagine huh
you the rat
laughing
wait a minute
what do you mean by that
inhales sharply
what do you mean
what do i mean
you couldnt be the rat
i absolutely could be the rat
not a chance
why not
why cause look at you
what about me
laughs
nah uhuh
youre just a fucking tailor
sniffs
im not a tailor
im a cutter
sorry
a tailor sews on buttons
and hems trousers
anyone with a needle and thread
and 15 minutes can be a tailor
i studied for decades
to be a cutter
i used to cut on the row
fuck is the row
savile row
wheres that north addison
its in london
a quarter of a mile in which
the greatest craftsmen
in the world
all ply their trade
i apprenticed there for years
before they allowed me
to open my own shop
whyd you come here then
the war
what krauts bomb your place
worse
theyre called blue jeans
stifled laugh
coughs
after the war
things were quite poor
in england
not a lot of men
could afford wellmade things
so these blue jeans
became all the rage
well times change pal
blue jeans are the fashion now
this james dean of yours
makes one picture
and blue jeans are the fashion
soon hell make another
something else
will become popular
these fashionable things
they dont last
the things i make
like that suit of yours
mm
its timeless
so you thought that a bunch
of fancypants in england
couldnt appreciate
the finer things
so you came to chicago
wow you must fucking
love red hots
i came to a place
that isnt weighed down
with bitter history
and yes
red hots are delicious

he was going exactly
oh no you cant think
he has anything to do with this
its not my place to speak ill
of master richie
but he keeps going on about
this rat you mentioned
what about the rat
he said before he was the one
looking for the rat
why would he place himself
in charge of looking for the rat
if he was the rat himself
so he told you all that
but he didnt tell you
where he was going
i know who the rat is
he says
francis thinks
he can pull one over on me
who me
well
he keeps fiddling
with your briefcase
what did he do to the case
nothing
he left the case in there
if i was the rat
and try as i might
i cant seem to convince you

roy sighs
i use this thing here to kill
i dont even know
how many people
all right
you got your tools i got mine
here
take a look
i read something once
about how the thing
that separates
man from monkeys is tools
do you believe all that
evolution
i dont know
but i do know that a man
has a choice in this world
about how he uses his tools
he can destroy or he can build
and you think i destroy
but no with this
ive built loyalty
i have built a crew
ive built a neighborhood
and the men ive had to kill
well you have to toss away
a few scraps dont you
when youre cutting
a pair of pants
have you ever heard of
the outfit
well i make clothes so
oh nnot that kind of outfit
its an organization
what like the rotary club
maybe youve heard of al capone
him ive heard of
yeah he started it
the rotary club
the outfit
al capones dead isnt he
after he died
his organization spread out
became more of a network
every bigtime crew from
santa monica to coney island
italians in the east
jews in the west
poles in st louis
even a few sons of killarney
here and there
the underworld united nations
anybody messes with anybody
the outfit has your back

sending us messages
saying they like our style
theyre considering us
if we can finish
what we started
and what have you started

to move in on their operation
until me

that tape gets into
the wrong hands

and if richie was to take off
in the middle of december
with a marble in his belly
then richie who

any more twists in store
if the devil himself
came crashing through the roof
i wouldnt be shocked right now
all right

belts and suspenders
mable sighs
make sure they dont go nowhere
door opens bell jingles
wind howling
sniffs
vehicle doors open close
engine starts
mable sniffles
vehicle driving away
panting softly
you want to tell me
who the fuck you just talked to
on that phone
that was one of mr boyles men
calling to say
hed yet to hear from richie
hmm
wait wait wait wait wait
either i kill her now
and we pin tonight
on her corpse
or i kill both of you
and do it all myself
its its your choice
you need her assistance
with what do i need
her assistance
roy boyle is about to walk
directly into an ambush
whos ambushing him
the la fontaines
and how exactly
are the la fontaines
gonna know where to ambush him
because mables
about to tell them
me
yes you
why me
because youre the rat
youve been sleeping
with richie boyle
you kept hearing him talk about
his fathers escalating war
with the la fontaines
and you saw your chance
you sold information
to la fontaine
so that you could finally
get out of chicago
but francis
francis is paranoid
sooner or later you thought
he would have found you out
so you helped the fbi
to plant a bug
if the fbi could take down
the boyle crew
you could get away clean
but you didnt plan
for one thing
the outfit
they told the boyles
about the bug
richie told you
what could you do
you told la fontaine
and hoped that they would
all kill each other
before they found you
you got your hustle
i got mine
you were you were
the fucking rat
ive spent my entire life
watching you leeches
suck this neighborhood dry
i am gonna love
sitting in a café in paris
reading all about your funeral
you stole the tape
no that was me
you knew what i was doing
and instead of stopping me
you helped
yes
fuck you
i can take care of myself
if she doesnt call
the la fontaines in the next
two minutes id say
roy boyle will return
having failed to find his son
eventually
hell discover richie
and then hell kill all of us
or mable can tell
the la fontaines
where to ambush him
and offer to sell them the tape
now tell me
if roy boyle and all his
senior lieutenants die tonight
who will be in charge
of his organization
i took six bullets for that man
and how many has he taken
for you
he made me everything
that i am today
and today is the day
that you dont need him anymore
you think im just gonna
betray roy boyle that easy
no i dont think its easy
i think option a is we all die
and option b is
you run the boyle organization
make the goddamn call
im not here
phone dialing
mable
bonsoir clears throat
mable speaking french
stetson
stetson
yes um clears throat
continues speaking french
roy boyle
continues speaking french
halsted
continues speaking french
la fontaine
continues speaking french
hangs up receiver
la fontaine wants
to make a deal
tape for cash one hour
i didnt know you spoke french
francis
the number of things about me
that you dont know
so what the fuck
really happened to richie
gasps
lid creaks shut
vehicle approaching
francis
thats la fontaine
im gonna hide in the back
as soon as you peep the green
you toss me a signal
counts right and then
imitates gunshot
this is a stupid fucking idea
you dont toss me a signal
im gonna come out firing
indiscriminatelike
when la fontaine dies tonight
im not only leading our crew
im leading them
into the outfit
its the least i could do
for roy
doorbell ringing
door sliding closed
whispering
hes gonna kill us too
bell jingles
bonsoir
youre open late
mm we work by appointment
this is mr burling
i didnt know this city
had any tailors so classy
thank you
door closes
you know how to make clothes
for a lady
i havent a clue
désolé
i might have an inkling
oh
chuckling
im guessing its been
quite an evening for you folks
leonard
hazard of the trade madame
which one of you has my tape
money first
la fontaine
please
la fontaine clicking tongue
la fontaine chuckles
looks like
madame la fontaine
are you trying to rob us
wheres the money
were not showing you the tape
until we see the money
tape first
how do i know whats on it
ive gotta listen
leonard
well it seems like
youre just gonna
have to trust us
la fontaine
ou peutêtre
we may be able
to trust each other
floorboard creaks
okay
lets make a deal
you give me the green
ill walk away
we all live to kill each other
some other time
la fontaine
you know what makes me mad
ive been running numbers
in this city my whole life
but nobody said a thing
cops racket boys
nobody even noticed
until the second
we started making real money
mon dieu this fucking city
since day one people like me
people like our english friend
we come here and we make
something of ourselves
and then right as soon
as we get big enough
you connards show up
with your hair slicked back
shoes all shiny
and you snatch it away
like a spoiled child
whod rather break his own toys
than watch somebody else
play with them
so i will admit to a
satisfaction earlier
at 31st and halsted
when i put a gun
to roy boyles head
and watched him die
as hed lived
sorry he ever met me
leonard
madame
you have nothing to fear
from this man
why is that
because earlier this evening
i removed all the bullets
from his gun
francis groans quietly
any other killers in here
i should know about
leonard
only you
a tailor
always listening never talking
but nobody stop to think
whats going on in his head
im not a tailor maam
im a cutter
un coupeur
au revoir
exhales slowly
mm
theyll find us out
the boyles are all dead
the outfit then
why would the outfit
come looking for us
because we took the tape
that everyone is loo
leonard
to the naked eye
a suit appears
to consist of two parts
the tape
a jacket and trousers
its just a fake
but these two
seemingly solid parts
are composed of
four different fabrics
mable the outfit has never even
heard of roy boyle
they didnt send those messages
you did
youve been planning this
for months
everything that happened
you set it all up
this contains everything
that went on here this evening
enough to convict
any remaining boyles
of a dozen crimes
and madame la fontaine
of the murder of roy boyle
you wont mind will you
popping it in the post
to your friend at the fbi
on your way to
chuckles softly
perhaps its safest if
i dont know
but make it somewhere grand
so what about you
oh ive started over before
itll be easier the second time
come with me
no
no come with me
you can show me things
youve already seen
you will not spend
your best years
taking care of my remaining few
mable i was taking care of
myself just fine you know
leonard
oh yes
knowing you im quite confident
youd have seen to the burials
of each and every one
of those murderers
but then
youd no longer be pretending
to be one
would you
i wish i could have met her
your real
you know
chuckles softly
she would have liked you
mable sniffles
bell jingles
door closes
leonard finishings for me
can be the hardest part
not because theres
any great skill involved
in these final steps
putting on a few buttons
closing up a few edges
but because
if youve done your job
all the true craftsmanship
has already occurred
the finishings are
mere inevitabilities
its at the finishings
that you must come to terms
with the idea
that perfection
is a necessary goal
precisely because
it is unattainable
if you dont aim for perfection
you cannot make anything great
and yet true perfection
is impossible
flames whooshing
cries out
groaning
grunting
gun clicking
gasps
oh
oh no
grunting
groaning
francis
stop
panting
clatters
leonard
so at the finish
you must reconcile yourself
to failure
i was like you once
grunts
i was
chuckles quietly
made my living with a gun
a knife
sometimes
just my bare hands
id
id a gift they said
but it wasnt magic
it was work
one day they asked me to do
something i couldnt do
so i ran i hid
i hid on the row
picked up a trade
learnt a craft and met my wife
vera
i fell in love
we had little lily
i fell in love again
but they found me
they found me
set fire to my shop
my home
my life
i came here to get away
from all that violence
get away from myself
chuckles
mmy first day here
who did i meet
huh
i suppose i put put on
these clothes
to convince myself
im civilized
i want so bad to be good
chuckles
grunting
gasping
gasps
francis gurgling
gasping
panting softly
flames crackling
whooshing crackling
leonard
its not perfect
you have to make your peace
with that
bell jingles
how
well
