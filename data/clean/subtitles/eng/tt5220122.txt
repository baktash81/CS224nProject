argh  it s just like you taught me 
it s even worse than i feared 
it was that fateful night
that i realized
a human could never defeat a monster 
 screaming 
but i wouldn t let
our family legacy die 
and so  i began to search for an answer 
and i saw it in an ancient text 
an instrument of destruction
so powerful it destroyed atlantis 
a whole city of monsters  
 chuckles 
and there  deep within the rubble 
it lay  waiting 
endlessly  i searched for the lost city 
time passed 
and my body began to fail me 
oh  it was so sad  ericka 
first my liver  then my spleen 
followed by a kidney or two 
then my golden locks  
 moans 
but i wouldn t let that stop me 
i replaced my failing organs
with technology 
ha ha 
and look at me now 
mmm hmm 
oh  girl  it s an improvement  really 
um  sure 
and now  after 120 years 
i have finally found atlantis 
oh  forget about all this 
let me get rid of dracula right now 
i was so close to him 
i could ve just   
 grunting 
no  no  no 
we have to stick to the plan 
lure the monsters to atlantis 
retrieve the instrument of destruction 
trap them there  and then wipe them out 
it s simple  ericka
