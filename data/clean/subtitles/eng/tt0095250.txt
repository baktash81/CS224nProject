mio figlio bravo
clapping conrinues
now
now
i am sure you heard some people suggest
it is too dangerous for us to continue
dangerous because
we dont know how to measure
the physiological consequences
of this type of dive
and also because the scuba divers
are not used to going down below 300 feet
but
cosa dice
we asked the free divers
and they all insist
that the competition continue
clapping
bravo
good luck to you all good luck

welcome to greece jacques how are you
welcome johana have a good trip
ok let me give you all the information
come with me
oh
this is making me sick
sighs why
would you give me a glass of water
door opens
nervous about the competition
no
whats it feel like when you dive
its a feeling of slipping without falling
the hardest thing is when you hit the bottom
why
because you have to find
a good reason to come back up
and i have a hard time finding one
well we have the same problem
why
because i have a hard time
finding a good reason to stay
i found one
ciao enzo ciao
enzo
is he here
yeah
good
it scares me when you look
at the sea like that
i used to dive here when i was a boy
i have something i want to talk to you about
not here
ok
can we talk here
lets talk about my world
my world is you
i love you
i wanna live with you
i wanna have a baby with you
i wanna have a house with you
a car with you a dog with you
you know
jacques i think i might be pregnant
did you hear me
jacques
jacques
jacques
jaaaaaacques
god
enzo playing piano
tomorrow is going to be a big day
when i analysed the data from
mayols last dive it became apparent
at the depths these men are diving
it is a physiological impossibility
that they could retain enough oxygen
to make it to the surface
the pressure is so strong it stops the oxygen
from circulating through the body
to attempt to break mayols record now
is simple suicide
do you understand
yes i understand
today is just training
molinari is a 17time world champion
three minutes
do you want to tell him he cant dive
ah
cancel the competition
two minutes
get mayol in here
short sharp brearhs
one minute
slower deeper brearhs
they wanna cancel the competition
for a while
why
its not safe they say
the doctors say
we cant go deeper and survive
you say that because you have the title
no
i would never cheat you
thats very nice of you
oh jesus i told you to tell him not to go
its not my fault i told him
no no no
and then they die
no ma che volere e la prima
volra che organizzo un rorneo
alarm
no no
wonderful
alarm srops
