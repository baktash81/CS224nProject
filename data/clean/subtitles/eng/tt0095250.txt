 clapping conrinues 
now   
now   
i am sure you heard some people suggest
it is too dangerous for us to continue 
dangerous because
we don t know how to measure   
   the physiological consequences
of this type of dive 
and also because the scuba divers
are not used to going down below 300 feet 
  but   
  cosa dice 
   we asked the free divers   
   and they all insist   
   that the competition continue

welcome to greece  jacques  how are you 
welcome  johana  have a good trip 
ok  let me give you all the information 
come with me 
oh   
this is making me sick 
 sighs  why 
would you give me a glass of water 
 door opens 
nervous about the competition 
no 
what s it feel like when you dive 
it s a feeling of slipping without falling 
the hardest thing is when you hit the bottom 
why 
because you have to find
a good reason to come back up 
and i have a hard time finding one 
well  we have the same problem 
why 
because i have a hard time
finding a good reason to stay 
i found one 
ciao  enzo  ciao 
enzo 
is he here 
yeah 
good 
it scares me when you look
at the sea like that 
i used to dive here when i was a boy 
i have something i want to talk to you about 
not here 
ok 
can we talk here 
let s talk about my world 
my world is you 
i love you 
i wanna live with you 
i wanna have a baby with you 
i wanna have a house with you 
a car with you  a dog with you 
you know 
jacques  i think i might be pregnant 
did you hear me 
jacques 
jacques 
jacques 
jaaaaaacques 
god    
 enzo playing piano 
tomorrow is going to be a big day 
when i analysed the data from
mayol s last dive  it became apparent 
at the depths these men are diving 
it is a physiological impossibility   
   that they could retain enough oxygen
to make it to the surface 
the pressure is so strong  it stops the oxygen
from circulating through the body 
to attempt to break mayol s record now   
   is simple suicide 
do you understand 
yes  i understand 
today is just training 
  molinari is a 17 time world champion 
  three minutes 
do you want to tell him he can t dive 
ah 
cancel the competition 
two minutes 
get mayol in here 
 short  sharp brearhs 
one minute 
 slower  deeper brearhs 
they wanna cancel the competition 
for a while 
why 
it s not safe  they say 
the doctors say   
   we can t go deeper and survive 
you say that because you have the title 
no 
i would never cheat you 
that s very nice of you 
oh  jesus  i told you to tell him not to go 
it s not my fault  i told him 
  no  no  no 
  and then they die 
no  ma che volere  e la prima
volra che organizzo un rorneo 
 alarm 
no    no   
wonderful
