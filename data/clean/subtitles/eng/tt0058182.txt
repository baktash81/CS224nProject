  if i fell in love with you  
  would you promise
to be true  
  and help me  
  understand  
   cause i ve been in love
before

that love was more  
  than just holding hands  
  if i give my heart  
  to you  
  i must be sure  
  from the very start  
  that you  
  would love me more than her  
  if i trust in you  
  oh  please  
  don t run and hide  
  if i love you  too  
  oh  please  
  don t hurt my pride
like her  
   cause i couldn t stand
the pain  
  and l  
  would be sad
if our new love  
  was in vain  
  so i hope you ll see  
  that l  
  would love to love you  
  and that she  
  will cry  
  when she learns we are two  
   cause i couldn t stand
the pain  
  and l  
  would be sad
if our new love  
  was in vain  
  so i hope you see  
  that l  
  would love to love you  
  and that she  
  will cry  
  when she learns we are two  
  if i fell in love with you  
pardon me  excuse me  pardon me

george 
i m terribly sorry   
but there seems to be
some sort of misunderstanding 
oh  you can come off it
with us 
you don t have to do the old
adenoidal glottal stop   
and carry on for our benefit 
i m afraid i don t understand 
oh  my god  he s a natural 
well  i did tell them
not to send us real ones 
they ought to know the phonies
are much easier to handle 
still  he s a good type 
we d like you to give us
your opinion   
on some clothes for teenagers 
oh  by all means 
i d be quite prepared
for that eventuality 
well  not your real opinion 
naturally 
it ll be written out 
and you ll learn it 
  can he read 
  of course i can 
i mean lines  ducky 
can you handle lines 
  well  i ll have a bash 
  good 
give him whatever it is
they drink  a coke a rama

simon

you ll really dig them 
they re fab and
all the other pimply hyperboles 
i wouldn t be seen dead in them 
they re dead grotty 
  grotty 
  yeah  grotesque 
make a note of that word
and give it to susan 
it s rather touching  really 
here s this kid   
trying to give me
his utterly valueless opinion   
when i know for a fact
that within a month   
he ll be suffering from
a violent inferiority complex   
and loss of status   
because he isn t wearing
one of these nasty things 
of course they re grotty 
you wretched nit 
that s why they were designed 
but that s what you ll want 
i won t 
you can be replaced 
chickie baby 
i don t care 
and that pose is out  too 
sonny jim 
the new thing is to care
passionately and be right wing 
anyway  if you don t cooperate 
you won t meet susan 
and who s this susan
when she s at home 
only susan campy
our resident teenager 
you ll have to love her 
she s your symbol 
oh  you mean that posh bird
who gets everything wrong 
i beg your pardon 
oh  yeah  the lads frequently
sit round the television   
and watch her for a giggle 
in fact  once we all sat down
and wrote these letters   
saying how gear she was
and all that rubbish 
she s a trendsetter 
it s her profession 
she s a drag   
a well known drag 
we turn the sound down on her
and say rude things 
  get him out of here 
  have i said something amiss 
get him out  he s knocking
the program s image 
  sorry about the shirts 
  get him out 
you don t think
he s a new phenomenon  do you 
you mean an early clue
to the new direction 
 snaps fingers 
where s the calendar 
oh  no  no  no  it s all right 
he s just a troublemaker 
the change isn t due
for three weeks yet 
all the same  make a note
not to extend susan s contract 
and let s not take
any unnecessary chances  hmm

but not our little richard 
oh  no 
when you re not thumping
them pagan skins
