break time
right
excuse me
id like to catch a sea bass
whats the difference between
a plug and a pencil popper
ill show you
the pencil poppers
there are so many
its confusing
happy to help
a plug is the generic name
for plastic fishing lures
that worked out great right
yuri you did a great job too
yay
in those situations
the trick is not to panic and
wait for a clerk to go on break
we dont need her help
this is what you
call workshare
whats that
it means what it sounds like
we all share the work
shes in the way
dont say that
shes your sister
shes not my sister
shes your sister
yuri is your sister
youre his sister right
its no big deal
he doesnt mean it
hes just rebelling now
how much can you get for those
about 40000 to 50000 yen
with these i wont have
to work anymore this month
hey aki
you should contribute too
youre making money right
she doesnt have to
thats the deal we made right
she gets her big ideas
because you always spoil her
youre the one
with the big ideas
youre preying on her pension
preying is not a nice word
try preying on me if you can
no one can prey on her
oh i got myself
an insurance plan
because i dont want
a lonely death
what do you call
that kind of insurance
youre so warm grandma
watch out
im mending with a needle
watch out
whose clothes
that girl the little girls
did something bad happen
why
your feet are colder than usual
you know everything
dont you grandma
youre lucky to have
such a pretty nose
you think so
i dont like it very much
dont stare at me
yuri lick salt
before you go to bed
shes right there
what why
whats going on you must be
cold sitting out here
will he come home
youre worried about shota
its not your fault yuri
how about the name no lonely
death for the insurance plan
even though shes being
abused by her parents
you mean yuri
she should be more worried about
her own troubles
with a mother who wishes
she hadnt given birth to you
usually
youd turn out more like us
youre right
you dont grow up
to care about others
youre right
here you are
i figured
ouch
its so cold
yuris so worried
shes been waiting for you
by the door the whole time
you dont like yuri
so whats wrong
its more fun with just us guys
of course it is
but for yuri
if she helps us out
its easier to live with us
right
got it
got it
yuri is your what
my sister
thats right right right

da

we havent eaten
any tuna recently
im going to eat you all up
hey hey
what
did you know
there used to be a pond here
yeah
apparently grandpa used to
keep carp in it

grandmas tall tales
the last time juri was seen

playing alone outside her home
she has been missing for over
two months but her parents
never filed a missing persons
report with the police
was it really yuri
what are you smelling me for
hey dont
hey yuris on tv
she was reported missing when
child welfare service
contacted the police
why did her parents
tell lie after lie
why did they
hide her disappearance
for over two months
the police are
questioning them
as important
material witnesses
the cops think her parents
killed her
what so her name is juri
not yuri
this looks bad really bad
its too late for that now
hey yuri listen
can you find your way home

have to do with this situation
no it wasnt a kidnapping
she looked like
she was starving
so nobuyo brought her home
and the girl was happy
to come with her
when was that
last february
thats what we call kidnapping
thats what i told her too
but she said
we werent demanding a ransom
so we were protecting her

move in with her
but that wasnt out of kindness
she was getting money
from the family
that stole her husband
money
from my parents
they paid her
every time she visited
what so my parents knew
that i was living with her
your parents say
they didnt know but
so grandma
only wanted their money
not me

shibata hatsue was discovered
several weeks have passed since
she died
and the police
are investigating
including the possibility
of murder
what the people who
pretended to be her family
were doing in this house
remains shrouded in mystery

all by yourself

corpse disposal carries
a heavy sentence

children need their mothers
thats just what
mothers imagine
giving birth automatically
makes you a mother
you cant become a mother
unless you do
i understand its tough
for you that cant give birth
were you jealous
is that why you kidnapped her
maybe
maybe i hated her my mother
