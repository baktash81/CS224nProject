excuse me 
i d like to catch a sea bass 
what s the difference between
a plug and a pencil popper 
i ll show you
the pencil poppers 
there are so many 
it s confusing 
happy to help 
a plug is the generic name
for plastic fishing lures 
that worked out great  right 
yuri  you did a great job  too 
yay 
in those situations 
the trick is not to panic and
wait for a clerk to go on break 
we don t need her help 
this is what you
call work share 
what s that 
it means what it sounds like 
we all share the work 
she s in the way 
don t say that 
she s your sister 
she s not my sister 
she s your sister 
yuri is your sister 
you re his sister  right 
it s no big deal 
he doesn t mean it 
he s just rebelling now 
how much can you get for those 
about 40 000 to 50 000 yen 
with these  i won t have
to work anymore this month 
hey aki 
you should contribute  too 
you re making money  right 
she doesn t have to 
that s the deal we made  right 
she gets her big ideas
because you always spoil her 
you re the one
with the big ideas 
you re preying on her pension 
 preying  is not a nice word 
try preying on me if you can 
no one can prey on her 
oh  i got myself
an insurance plan 
because i don t want
a lonely death 
what do you call
that kind of insurance 
  you re so warm  grandma 
  watch out 
i m mending with a needle 
watch out 
whose clothes 
that girl  the little girl s 
did something bad happen 
why 
your feet are colder than usual 
you know everything 
don t you  grandma 
you re lucky to have
such a pretty nose 
you think so 
i don t like it very much 
don t stare at me 
yuri  lick salt
before you go to bed 
she s right there 
what  why 
what s going on  you must be
cold  sitting out here 
will he come home 
you re worried about shota 
it s not your fault  yuri 
how about the name  no lonely
death  for the insurance plan 
even though she s being
abused by her parents   
you mean yuri 
she should be more worried about
her own troubles 
with a mother who wishes
she hadn t given birth to you 
usually 
you d turn out more like us 
you re right 
you don t grow up
to care about others 
you re right 
here you are 
i figured 
ouch 
it s so cold 
yuri s so worried 
she s been waiting for you
by the door the whole time 
you don t like yuri 
so  what s wrong 
it s more fun with just us guys 
of course  it is 
but for yuri 
if she helps us out 
it s easier to live with us 
right 
got it 
got it 
yuri is your what 
my sister 
that s right  right  right 
in that case  what am i 
i m your   
da   
  it s ok 
  say it  c mon 
just try saying it  once 
go ahead 
i will  someday 
shoot  not fair

it s in the japanese textbook 
your dad s japanese
is even worse 
swimmy is a story about
a bunch of little fish 
that beat up a great big tuna 
do you know why

must be because
tuna tastes good  right 
i don t think so

did you know
there used to be a pond here

i m sure that s one of
grandma s tall tales 
the last time juri was seen
was february 8th 
a neighbor remembers seeing her
playing alone outside her home 
she has been missing for over
two months  but her parents
never filed a missing persons
report with the police 
was it really yuri 
what are you smelling me for 
hey  don t 
hey  yuri s on tv 
she was reported missing when
child welfare service
contacted the police 
why did her parents
tell lie after lie 
why did they
hide her disappearance
for over two months 
the police are
questioning them
as important
material witnesses 
the cops think her parents
killed her 
what  so  her name is juri 
not yuri 
this looks bad  really bad 
it s too late for that now 
hey  yuri  listen 
can you find your way home
by yourself 
she can t do that 
it s too late 
what will you do 
try going home 
you ll stay here  right 
how about hana  i had

juri 
how many of you
went to the beach 
five people 
  five people 
  five people 
what were you doing
at the beach 
jumping 
jumping 
was your grandma with you then 
where were you living 
in a car 
in a car 
all alone 
yes 
are you covering up for someone 
when we got to the house 
they were all
packing their things up
and trying to run away 
abandoning you 
a real family would
never treat you like that 
the man s real name is
enoki shota 
the woman is tanabe yuko 
they had killed someone 
her previous husband 
stabbed him  killed him
and buried him 
tangled up
in a crime of passion 
that s how those two   
are connected 
that was self defense  right 
if we hadn t killed him 
he would ve killed us both 
well  that s how
the judge ruled 
and what does that
have to do with this situation 
no  it wasn t a kidnapping 
she looked like
she was starving 
so nobuyo brought her home 
and the girl was happy
to come with her 
when was that 
last february 
that s what we call kidnapping 
that s what i told her too 
but she said   
we weren t demanding a ransom 
so we were protecting her 
thank you for coming 
how is juri doing 
yes 
i guess she was relieved 
she fell fast asleep 
nozomi 
what did juri eat yesterday 
her favorite 
omelet with rice 
you cooked it
for your daughter 
yes  i cooked it 
that s because   
grandma asked me to
move in with her 
but that wasn t out of kindness 
she was getting money
from the family
that stole her husband 
money 
from my parents 
they paid her
every time she visited 
what  so  my parents knew
that i was living with her 
your parents say
they didn t know  but   
so  grandma   
only wanted their money 
not me 
where is your grandma now 
we re outside the house where
shibata hatsue was discovered 
several weeks have passed since
she died 
and the police
are investigating 
including the possibility
of murder 
what the people who
pretended to be her family
were doing in this house
remains shrouded in mystery 
so  you say you did it
all by yourself 
yes 
the digging and the burying 
that s right 
i did it all myself 
corpse disposal carries
a heavy sentence 
do you understand 
i didn t throw her away 
yes  you did 
i didn t throw her away 
i found her 
someone threw her away
and i found her 
it was someone else
who threw her away 
didn t you feel guilty
making children shoplift 
i   
don t know anything else
to teach them 
but still   
why did you name the boy shota 
that s your real name  right 
is it an apartment 
a two story house 
you ll live there
with six other children 
  just with other kids 
  yes 
you could commute to school
from there  shota 
i thought only kids who can t
study at home go to school 
there are some things
you can t study at home 
like what 
meeting people 
making new friends 
how is lin doing 
she went back to her family 
her real family 
yeah 
shota  if you  too   
but i don t remember anything 
you know  this   
listen  i m busy  go away 
that hurts 
i told you not to touch me 
just go away 
say you re sorry 
say you re sorry 
juri   
i ll buy you new clothes 
so come over here 
why not  come here 
lin said she wanted to go back 
yes  juri is her name 
no  she would never say that 
children need their mothers 
that s just what
mothers imagine 
giving birth automatically
makes you a mother 
you can t become a mother
unless you do 
i understand it s tough
for you that can t give birth 
were you jealous 
is that why you kidnapped her 
maybe 
maybe i hated her  my mother 
what did the two children
call you 
mommy 
mother 
i wonder   
i wonder   
there are two types of lures 
there are soft lures 
made of rubber 
they look like small fish
or worms 
to catch other fish  they say 
and the other type   
is the hard lure 
it s called the hard lure 
they re made from
wood or plastic 
and they re used to catch
big fish and things like that 
where did you learn all that 
it was in a book 
in a book 
i m sorry 
you re doing my time  too 
you ve got a record 
you wouldn t get away
with just five years 
but you   
i had such a good time 
this is nothing  really 
i m sorry 
it s because i got caught 
don t worry about it
