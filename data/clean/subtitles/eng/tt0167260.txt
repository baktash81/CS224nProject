my precious 
they cursed us 
murderer 
 murderer  they called us 
they cursed us
and drove us away 
gollum 
gollum 
gollum 
and we wept  precious 
we wept to be so alone 
  and cool
so nice for feet
and we only wish
to catch a fish
so juicy sweet
and we forgot the taste of bread   
   the sound of trees   
   the softness of the wind 
we even forgot our own name 
my precious 
wake up

haven t you had any sleep  mr  frodo 
i ve gone and had too much

only  you ve never done
a hard day s work 
welcome  my lords   
   to isengard 
you young rascals 
a merry hunt you ve led us on   
   and now we find you feasting
and   and smoking 
we are sitting
on a field of victory   
   enjoying a few well earned comforts 
the salted pork is particularly good 
salted pork 
  huh  hobbits 
  we re under orders from treebeard   
   who s taken over management
of isengard 
young master gandalf 
i m glad you ve come 
wood and water  stock and stone
i can master 
but there is a wizard to manage here   
   locked in his tower 
and there saruman must remain
under your guard  treebeard 
well  let s just have his head
and be done with it 
no 
he has no power anymore 
the filth of saruman   
   is washing away 
trees will come back to live here 
young trees 
  wild trees 
  pippin 
bless my bark 
peregrin took 
i ll take that  my lad 
quickly  now 
tonight we remember
those who gave their blood   
   to defend this country 
hail the victorious dead 
hail 
i am happy for you 
he is an honorable man 
you are both honorable men 
it was not théoden of rohan
who led our people to victory 
ah  don t listen to me 
you are young 
and tonight is for you 
oh  you can search far and wide
you can drink the whole town dry
but you ll never find a beer so brown
but you ll never find a beer so brown
as the one we drink in our hometown
as the one we drink in our hometown
you can drink your fancy ales
you can drink  em by the flagon
but the only brew for the brave and true
comes from the green dragon
thank you  i win 
no news of frodo 
no word  nothing 
we have time 
every day  frodo moves closer to mordor 
do we know that 
what does your heart tell you 
that frodo is alive 
yes 
yes  he s alive 
too risky  too risky 
thieves 
they stole it from us 
kill them  kill them  kill them both 
shh  quiet  mustn t wake them 
mustn t ruin it now 
but they knows 
they knows 
they suspects us 
what s it saying  my precious  my love 
is sméagol losing his nerve 
no  not 
never  sméagol hates nasty hobbitses 
sméagol wants to see them dead 
and we will 
sméagol did it once 
he can do it again 
it s ours 
ours 
we must get the precious 
we must get it back 
patience  patience  my love 
first we must lead them to her 
we lead them to the winding stair 
yes  the stairs  and then 
up  up  up  up 
up the stairs we go   
   until we come to the tunnel 
and when they go in   
   there s no coming out 
she s always hungry 
she always needs to feed 
she must eat 
all she gets is filthy orcses 
and they doesn t taste very nice 
does they  precious 
no 
not very nice at all  my love 
she hungers for sweeter meats 
hobbit meat 
and when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes   
 then we will find it 
and take it for me 
for us 
yes  we meant  for us  
gollum  gollum 
the precious will be ours   
   once the hobbitses are dead 
you treacherous little toad 
no  no  master 
no  sam  leave him alone 
i heard it from his own mouth 
he means to murder us 
never  sméagol wouldn t hurt a fly 
he s a horrid  fat hobbit   
   who hates sméagol   
   and who makes up nasty lies 
you miserable little maggot 
i ll stove your head in 
sam 
call me a liar  you re a liar 
  you scare him off  we re lost 
  i don t care  i can t do it  mr  frodo 
  i won t wait around for him to kill us 
  i m not sending him away 
you don t see it  do you 
he s a villain 
we can t do this by ourselves  sam 
not without a guide 
i need you on my side 
i m on your side  mr  frodo 
i know  sam  i know 
trust me 
come  sméagol 
the stars are veiled 
something stirs in the east 
a sleepless malice 
the eye of the enemy is moving 
what are you doing 
pippin 
pippin 
pippin 
  what  are you mad 
  i just want to look at it 
just one more time 
put it back 
pippin 
no 
pippin 
he is here 
i see you 
pippin 
help  gandalf  help 
someone help him 
pippin 
fool of a took 
look at me 
gandalf  forgive me 
look at me 
what did you see 
a tree 
there was a white tree   
   in a courtyard of stone 
it was dead 
the city was burning 
minas tirith  is that what you saw 
i saw   
i saw him 
i could hear his voice in my head 
and what did you tell him 
speak 
he asked me my name 
i didn t answer 
he hurt me 
what did you tell him
about frodo and the ring 
there was no lie in pippin s eyes 
a fool   
   but an honest fool he remains 
he told sauron nothing
of frodo and the ring 
we ve been strangely fortunate 
pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy s plan 
sauron moves to strike
the city of minas tirith 
his defeat at helm s deep
showed our enemy one thing 
he knows the heir of elendil
has come forth 
men are not as weak as he supposed 
there is courage still  strength
enough perhaps to challenge him 
sauron fears this 
he will not risk the peoples of
middle earth uniting under one banner 
he will raze minas tirith
to the ground   
   before he sees a king
return to the throne of men 
if the beacons of gondor are lit 
rohan must be ready for war 
tell me   
   why should we ride to the aid   
   of those who did not come to ours 
what do we owe gondor 
  i will go 
  no 
  they must be warned 
  they will be 
you must come to minas tirith
by another road 
follow the river
and look to the black ships 
understand this 
things are now in motion
that cannot be undone 
i ride for minas tirith   
   and i won t be going alone 
of all the inquisitive hobbits 
peregrin took  you are the worst 
hurry  hurry 
where are we going 
why did you look 
why do you always have to look 
  i don t know  i can t help it 
  you never can 
i m sorry  all right 
  i won t do it again 
  don t you understand 
the enemy thinks you have the ring 
he s going to be looking for you  pip 
they have to get you out of here 
and you    you re coming with me 
merry 
come on 
how far is minas tirith 
three days  ride  as the nazgûl flies 
and you better hope we don t have
one of those on our tail 
here 
something for the road 
the last of the longbottom leaf 
i know you ve run out 
you smoke too much  pippin 
but   but we ll see each other soon 
  won t we 
  i don t know 
i don t know what s going to happen 
  merry 
  run  shadowfax 
show us the meaning of haste 
merry 
merry 
take her by the safest road 
a ship lies anchored
in the grey havens 
it waits to carry her across the sea 
the last journey of arwen undómiel 
there is nothing for you here   
   only death 
lady arwen   
   we cannot delay 
my lady 
  tell me what you have seen 
  arwen 
you have the gift of foresight 
what did you see 
i looked into your future 
and i saw death 
but there is also life 
you saw there was a child 
you saw my son 
that future is almost gone 
but it is not lost 
nothing is certain 
some things are certain 
if i leave him now   
   i will regret it forever 
it is time 
from the ashes a fire shall be woken
a light from the shadow shall spring
renewed shall be blade that was broken
the crownless again shall be king
re forge the sword 
your hands are cold 
the life of the eldar is leaving you 
this was my choice 
whether by your will or not   
   there is no ship now
that can bear me hence 
we ve just passed
into the realm of gondor 
minas tirith 
city of kings 
make way 
it s the tree 
gandalf  gandalf 
yes  the white tree of gondor 
the tree of the king 
lord denethor  however 
is not king 
he is a steward only 
a caretaker of the throne 
now listen carefully 
lord denethor is boromir s father 
to give him news of his beloved son s
death would be most unwise 
and do not mention frodo or the ring 
and say nothing of aragorn either 
in fact  it s better if you
don t speak at all  peregrin took 
hail denethor  son of ecthelion 
lord and steward of gondor 
i come with tidings in this dark hour 
and with counsel 
perhaps you come to explain this 
perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead 
boromir died to save us   
   my kinsman and me 
  he fell defending us from many foes 
  pippin 
i offer you my service  such as it is   
   in payment of this debt 
get up 
my lord  there will be a time
to grieve for boromir   
   but it is not now 
war is coming 
the enemy is on your doorstep 
as steward  you are charged   
   with the defense of this city 
where are gondor s armies 
you still have friends 
you are not alone in this fight 
send word to théoden of rohan 
light the beacons 
you think you are wise  mithrandir 
yet for all your subtleties 
you have not wisdom 
do you think the eyes
of the white tower are blind 
i have seen more than you know 
with your left hand you would use me
as a shield against mordor 
and with your right
you d seek to supplant me 
i know who rides with théoden of rohan 
oh  yes  word has reached my ears
of this aragorn  son of arathorn 
and i tell you now  i will not bow
to this ranger from the north   
   last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship 
authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king  steward 
the rule of gondor is mine
and no other s 
come 
so i imagine this is just
a ceremonial position 
i mean  they don t actually expect me
to do any fighting 
  do they 
  you re in the service of the steward now 
you re going to have to do
as you re told 
peregrin took  guard of the citadel 
it s so quiet 
it s the deep breath before the plunge 
i don t want to be in a battle   
   but waiting on the edge of one
i can t escape is even worse 
is there any hope  gandalf 
for frodo and sam 
there never was much hope 
just a fool s hope 
our enemy is ready 
his full strength s gathered 
not only orcs  but men as well 
legions of haradrim from the south   
   mercenaries from the coast 
all will answer mordor s call 
come on 
this will be the end of gondor
as we know it 
here the hammer stroke will fall hardest 
if the river is taken 
if the garrison at osgiliath falls   
   the last defense of this city
will be gone 
but we have the white wizard 
that s got to count for something 
gandalf 
sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant   
   the one who will lead
mordor s armies in war 
the one they say no living man can kill 
the witch king of angmar 
you ve met him before 
he stabbed frodo on weathertop 
he is the lord of the nazgûl   
   the greatest of the nine 
minas morgul   
   is his lair 
the dead city 
very nasty place  full of enemies 
quick  quick 
they will see  they will see 
come away  come away 
look  we have found it 
the way into mordor 
the secret stair 
climb 
  no  mr  frodo 
  not that way 
  what s it doing 
  no 
  they re calling me 
  no 
hide  hide 
i can feel his blade 
we come to it at last 
the great battle of our time 
come away  hobbits 
we climb  we must climb 
the board is set 
the pieces are moving 
peregrin took  my lad 
there is a task now to be done 
another opportunity for one of the
shire folk to prove their great worth 
you must not fail me 
quiet 
  to the river  quick  quick 
  go  go 
come on 
faster 
draw swords 
hold  hold 
what 
amon dîn 
the beacon 
the beacon of amon dîn is lit 
hope is kindled 
the beacons of minas tirith 
the beacons are lit 
gondor calls for aid 
and rohan will answer 
muster the rohirrim 
assemble the army at dunharrow 
as many men as can be found 
you have two days 
on the third 
we ride for gondor and war 
  forward 
  very good  sir 
  gamling 
  my lord 
make haste
across the riddermark 
summon every able bodied man
to dunharrow 
i will 
  will you ride with us 
  just to the encampment 
it s tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men 
the men have found their captain 
they will follow you into battle 
even to death 
you have given us hope 
so it is before the walls
of minas tirith   
   the doom of our time will be decided 
now is the hour 
riders of rohan  oaths you have taken 
now  fulfill them all 
to lord and land  hyah 
faramir 
we can t hold them  the city is lost 
tell the men to break cover 
we ride for minas tirith 
nazgûl 
take cover 
nazgûl 
fall back  fall back to minas tirith 
fall back 
  retreat  retreat 
  come on 
the age of men is over 
the time of the orc has come 
  take cover 
  faster  faster 
take cover  my lord 
it s coming 
  it s mithrandir 
  the white rider 
pull 
mithrandir 
they broke through our defenses 
they ve taken the bridge
and the west bank 
battalions of orcs are crossing the river 
it is as the lord denethor predicted 
  long has he foreseen this doom 
  foreseen and done nothing 
faramir 
this is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path 
no 
you ve seen frodo and sam 
  where  when 
  in lthilien 
not two days ago 
gandalf  they re taking the road
to the morgul vale 
and then the pass of cirith ungol 
what does that mean 
  what s wrong 
  faramir  tell me everything 
careful  master  careful 
very far to fall 
very dangerous are the stairs 
come  master 
come to sméagol 
mr  frodo 
get back  you 
don t touch him 
why does he hates poor sméagol 
what has sméagol ever done to him 
master 
master carries heavy burden 
sméagol knows 
heavy  heavy burden 
fat one cannot know 
sméagol look after master 
he wants it 
he needs it 
sméagol sees it in his eye 
very soon he will ask you for it 
you will see 
the fat one will take it from you 
send forth all legions 
do not stop the attack
until the city is taken 
slay them all 
  what of the wizard 
  i will break him 
what of théoden s riders 
will rohan s army come 
mithrandir 
courage is the best defense
that you have now 
here do i swear fealty
and service to gondor   
   in peace or war   
   in living or dying   
   from   
from this hour henceforth   
   until my lord release me   
   or death take me 
and i shall not forget it   
   nor fail to reward
that which is given 
fealty with love 
valor with honor 
disloyalty with vengeance 
i do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses   
   defenses that your brother
long held intact 
  what would you have me do 
  i will not yield   
   the river in pelennor unfought 
osgiliath must be retaken 
my lord  osgiliath is overrun 
much must be risked in war 
is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord s will 
you wish now that our places
had been exchanged   
   that i had died
and boromir had lived 
yes 
i wish that 
since you were robbed
of boromir   
   i will do what i can
in his stead 
if i should return 
think better of me  father 
that will depend on the manner
of your return 
ugh 
what are you up to 
sneaking off  are we 
sneaking 
sneaking  
fat hobbit is always so polite 
sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find   
   and they say  sneak  
sneak 
very nice friend 
oh  yes  my precious 
  very nice  very nice 
  all right  all right 
you just startled me is all 
what were you doing 
sneaking 
fine  have it your own way 
i m sorry to wake you  mr  frodo 
we have to be moving on 
it s dark still 
it s always dark here 
it s gone 
  the elven bread 
  what 
that s all we have left 
he took it  he must have 
sméagol 
no  no  not poor sméagol 
sméagol hates nasty elf bread 
you re a lying wretch 
what did you do with it  
he doesn t eat it 
  he can t have taken it 
  look 
what s this 
crumbs on his jacketses 
he took it 
he took it 
i seen him 
he s always stuffing his face   
     when master s not looking 
  that s a filthy lie 
you stinking  two faced sneak 
  sam 
  call me

sam 
  i ll kill him 
  sam  no 
oh  my   i m sorry  i didn t mean it
to go so far  i was just so   so angry 
here  just   
let s just rest a bit 
  i m all right 
  no 
no  you re not all right 
you re exhausted 
it s that gollum 
it s this place 
it s that thing around your neck 
i could help a bit 
i could carry it for a while 
carry it for a while 
i could carry it 
share the load    share the load   
the load    the load 
get away 
i don t want to keep it 
i just want to help 
see  see 
he wants it for himself 
shut up  you

no  sam 
it s you 
i m sorry  sam 
but he s a liar 
he s poisoned you against me 
you can t help me anymore 
you don t mean that 
go home 
faramir 
faramir 
your father s will has turned
to madness 
do not throw away your life
so rashly 
where does my allegiance lie
if not here 
your father loves you  faramir 
he will remember it
before the end 
can you sing  master hobbit 
well   
   yes 
at least  well enough
for my own people 
but we have no songs
for great halls   
   and evil times 
and why should your songs
be unfit for my halls 
come  sing me a song 
home is behind
the world ahead
and there are many paths to tread
through shadow
to the edge of night
until the stars are all alight
mist and shadow
cloud and shade
all shall fade
all shall
fade
march  march 
march  march  march 
make way for the king 
make way 
the king is here 
my lord 
hail to you  sire 
grimbold  how many 
i bring 500 men from the westfold 
my lord 
we have 300 more
from fenmarch  théoden king 
  where are the riders from snowbourn 
  none have come  my lord 
six thousand spears 
less than half of what i d hoped for 
six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of mordor 
more will come 
every hour lost hastens gondor s defeat 
we have till dawn 
then we must ride 
the horses are restless   
   and the men are quiet 
they grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain 
that road there   
   where does that lead 
it is the road to the dimholt 
the door under the mountain 
none who venture there ever return 
that mountain is evil 
hold 
aragorn 
let s find some food 
there 
a true esquire of rohan 
i m ready 
sorry 
it isn t all that dangerous 
it s not even sharp 
well  that s no good  you won t kill
many orcs with a blunt blade 
come on 
to the smithy  go 
you should not encourage him 
you should not doubt him 
i do not doubt his heart 
only the reach of his arm 
why should merry be left behind 
he has as much cause
to go to war as you 
why can he not fight
for those he loves 
i choose a mortal life 
i wish i could ve seen him   
   one last time 
sir 
king théoden awaits you  my lord 
i take my leave 
my lord elrond 
i come on behalf of one whom i love 
arwen is dying 
she will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from mordor 
the light of the evenstar is failing 
as sauron s power grows 
her strength wanes 
arwen s life is now tied
to the fate of the ring 
the shadow is upon us  aragorn 
the end has come 
it will not be our end  but his 
you ride to war  but not to victory 
sauron s armies march on minas tirith 
this you know 
but in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river 
a fleet of corsairs ships sails
from the south 
they ll be in the city in two days 
you re outnumbered  aragorn 
you need more men 
there are none 
there are those who dwell
in the mountain 
murderers   
   traitors 
you would call upon them to fight 
they believe in nothing 
they answer to no one 
they will answer
to the king of gondor 
andúril  the flame of the west 
forged from the shards of narsil 
sauron will not have forgotten
the sword of elendil 
the blade that was broken
shall return to minas tirith 
the man who can wield
the power of this sword   
   can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth 
put aside the ranger 
become who you were born to be 
take the dimholt road 
i give hope to men 
i keep none for myself 
why are you doing this 
the war lies to the east 
you cannot leave on the eve of battle 
you cannot abandon the men 
éowyn   
we need you here 
why have you come 
do you not know 
it is but a shadow and a thought
that you love 
i cannot give you what you seek 
just where do you think
you re off to 
not this time 
  this time you must stay  gimli 
  mm 
have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of dwarves 
you might as well accept it 
we re going with you  laddie 
  what s happening 
  where is he going 
where s he going 
i don t understand 
lord aragorn 
why does he leave on the eve of battle 
  he leaves because there is no hope 
  he leaves because he must 
too few have come 
we cannot defeat
the armies of mordor 
no   
   we cannot 
but we will meet them
in battle nonetheless 
i have left instruction 
the people are to follow
your rule in my stead 
take up my seat in the golden hall 
long may you defend edoras   
   if the battle goes ill 
what other duty would you
have me do  my lord 
duty 
no 
i would have you smile again   
   not grieve for those
whose time has come 
you shall live to see
these days renewed   
   and no more despair 
what kind of army would linger
in such a place 
one that is cursed 
long ago  the men of the mountains
swore an oath   
   to the last king of gondor   
   to come to his aid   
   to fight 
but when the time came   
   when gondor s need was dire   
   they fled   
   vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain 
and so isildur cursed them   
   never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge 
the very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away 
the way is shut 
it was made by those
who are dead 
and the dead keep it 
the way is shut 
brego 
i do not fear death 
well  this is a thing unheard of 
an elf will go underground
where a dwarf dare not 
oh 
oh  i d never hear the end of it 
we must ride light and swift 
it is a long road ahead 
and man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight 
little hobbits do not belong in war 
master meriadoc 
all my friends have gone to battle 
i would be ashamed to be left behind 
it is a three day gallop to minas tirith

i didn t think it would end this way

no  the journey doesn t end here 
death is just another path   
   one that we all must take 
the grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back   
   and all turns to silver glass 
and then you see it 
what  gandalf 
see what 
white shores   
   and beyond 
a far green country   
   under a swift sunrise 
well   
   that isn t so bad

rally to me  to me 
feast on his flesh 
i will kill you if you touch him

there s plenty for the both of us 
may the best dwarf win

i am going to save you 
you already did 
éowyn

i go to my fathers   
   in whose mighty company   
   i shall not now feel ashamed 
éowyn

hands off 
that shiny shirt  that s mine 
it s going to the great eye 
along with everything else 
i don t take orders from
stinking morgul rats 
you touch it 
and i ll stick this blade in your gut 
the scum tried to knife me 
kill him 
argh 
that s for frodo 
and for the shire 
and that s for my old gaffer 
stop your squealing  you dunghill rat 
i m gonna bleed you like a stuck pig 
  not if i stick you first 
  sam 
oh  sam  i m so sorry 
sorry for everything 
  let s get you out of here 
  it s too late  it s over 
they ve taken it  sam   
   they took the ring 
begging your pardon  but they haven t 
i thought i d lost you 
so i took it 
only for safekeeping 
give it to me 
give me the ring  sam 
sam 
give me the ring 
you must understand 
the ring is my burden 
it will destroy you  sam 
come on  mr  frodo 
we best find you some clothes 
you can t go walking through mordor
in naught but your skin 
we did it  mr  frodo 
we made it to mordor 
there are so many of them 
we ll never get through unseen 
it s him  the eye 
we have to go in there  mr  frodo 
there s nothing for it 
come on  let s just make it
down the hill for starters 
frodo has passed beyond my sight 
the darkness is deepening 
if sauron had the ring  we would know it 
it s only a matter of time 
he has suffered a defeat  yes   
   but behind the walls of mordor 
our enemy is regrouping 
let him stay there 
let him rot  why should we care 
because 10 000 orcs now stand
between frodo and mount doom 
i ve sent him to his death 
no 
there is still hope for frodo 
he needs time and safe passage
across the plains of gorgoroth 
  we can give him that 
  how 
draw out sauron s armies 
empty his lands 
then we gather our full strength
and march on the black gate 
we cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms 
not for ourselves 
but we can give frodo his chance
if we keep sauron s eye fixed upon us 
keep him blind to all else that moves 
a diversion 
sauron will suspect a trap 
he will not take the bait 
certainty of death   
   small chance of success   
   what are we waiting for 
to the gate  you slugs 
move it  to the gate 
look  the orcs   
   they re moving off 
you see  mr  frodo   
   some luck at last 
take mine 
there s a few drops left 
there will be none left
for the return journey 
i don t think there will be
a return journey  mr  frodo 
frodo  get down 
hide 
frodo 
where are they 
let the lord of the black land come forth 
let justice be done upon him 
fall back 
fall back 
it s gone  mr  frodo 
the light s passed on 
away towards the north 
something s drawn its gaze 
hold your ground  hold your ground 
sons of gondor  of rohan  my brothers 
i see in your eyes   
   the same fear that would take
the heart of me 
a day may come
when the courage of men fails   
   when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship 
but it is not this day 
an hour of wolves
and shattered shields   
   when the age of men
comes crashing down 
but it is not this day 
this day we fight 
by all that you hold dear
on this good earth   
   i bid you stand  men of the west 
never thought i d die fighting
side by side with an elf 
what about side by side with a friend 
aye 
i could do that 
do you remember the shire 
mr  frodo 
it ll be spring soon 
and the orchards will be in blossom 
and the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket 
and they ll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields   
   and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream 
do you remember
the taste of strawberries 
no  sam 
i can t recall the taste of food   
   nor the sound of water   
   nor the touch of grass 
i m   
   naked in the dark 
there s   there s nothing 
no veil between me
and the wheel of fire 
i can see him   
   with my waking eyes 
then let us be rid of it   
   once and for all 
come on  mr  frodo 
i can t carry it for you   
   but i can carry you 
come on 
aragorn 
elessar 
for frodo 
look  mr  frodo 
a doorway 
we re almost there 
clever hobbits to climb so high 
frodo 
eagles 
the eagles are coming 
frodo 
i m here  sam 
destroy it 
go on  now 
throw it in the fire 
what are you waiting for 
just let it go 
the ring is mine 
no 
no 
no 
yes 
yes 
precious  precious 
precious  precious 
give me your hand 
take my hand 
no 
don t you let go 
don t let go 
reach 
frodo 
frodo 
it s gone 
it s done 
yes  mr  frodo 
it s over now 
i can see the shire 
the brandywine river 
bag end 
gandalf s fireworks 
the lights in the party tree 
rosie cotton dancing 
she had ribbons in her hair 
if ever i was to marry someone   
   it would ve been her 
it would ve been her 
i m glad to be with you 
samwise gamgee   
   here at the end of all things 
gandalf 
frodo 
gimli 
now come the days of the king 
may they be blessed 
this day does not belong to one man   
   but to all 
let us together rebuild this world   
   that we may share
in the days of peace 
my friends   
   you bow to no one 
and thus it was 
a fourth age of middle earth began 
and the fellowship of the ring   
   though eternally bound
by friendship and love   
   was ended 
thirteen months to the day since gandalf
sent us on our long journey   
   we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight 
we were home 
hi 
hey  watch the pumpkin 
hey   
rosie  rosie 
good night  lads 
hm 
how do you pick up
the threads of an old life 
how do you go on   
   when in your heart
you begin to understand   
   there is no going back 
there are some things
that time cannot mend   
   some hurts that go too deep   
   that have taken hold 
mr  frodo 
what is it 
it s been four years to the day
since weathertop  sam 
it s never really healed 
 there and back again  a hobbit s tale
by bilbo baggins 
and the lord of the rings
by frodo baggins  
you finished it 
not quite 
there s room for a little more 
bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end   
   that each of us must come and go
in the telling 
bilbo s story was now over 
there would be no more journeys
for him   
   save one 
tell me again  lad  where are we going 
to the harbor  bilbo 
the elves have accorded you
a special honor   
   a place on the last ship
to leave middle earth 
frodo   
   any chance of seeing
that old ring of mine again 
the one i gave you 
sorry  uncle 
i m afraid i lost it 
oh 
pity 
i should like to have held it
one last time 
oh 
well  here s a sight
i have never seen before 
the power of the three rings is ended 
the time has come   
   for the dominion of men 
the sea calls us home 
i think i m   
   quite ready
for another adventure 
farewell   
   my brave hobbits 
my work is now finished 
here at last 
on the shores of the sea   
   comes the end of our fellowship 
i will not say   do not weep    
   for not all tears are an evil 
it is time  frodo 
what does he mean 
we set out to save the shire  sam 
and it has been saved 
but not for me 
you don t mean that 
you can t leave 
the last pages are for you  sam 
my dear sam 
you cannot always be torn in two 
you will have to be one and whole
for many years 
you have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do 
your part in the story will go on 
well   
   i m back 
lay down
your sweet and weary head
night is falling
you have come
to journey s end
sleep now
and dream
of the ones who came before
they are calling
from across
the distant shore
why do you weep 
what are these tears
upon your face 
soon you will see
all of your fears
will pass away
safe in my arms
you re only sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon 
why do the white gulls
call 
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
all souls pass
hope fades
into the world of night
through shadows falling
out of memory and time
don t say
we have come now to the end
white shores are calling
you and i will meet again
and you ll be here
in my arms
just sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon 
why do the white gulls
call 
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
