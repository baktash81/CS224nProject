locked in his tower
and there saruman must remain
under your guard treebeard

tonight we remember
those who gave their blood
to defend this country
hail the victorious dead

he is an honorable man
you are both honorable men
it was not théoden of rohan
who led our people to victory
ah dont listen to me
you are young
and tonight is for you
oh you can search far and wide
you can drink the whole town dry
but youll never find a beer so brown
but youll never find a beer so brown
as the one we drink in our hometown
as the one we drink in our hometown
you can drink your fancy ales
you can drink em by the flagon
but the only brew for the brave and true
comes from the green dragon
thank you i win
no news of frodo
no word nothing
we have time
every day frodo moves closer to mordor
do we know that
what does your heart tell you
that frodo is alive
yes
yes hes alive
too risky too risky
thieves
they stole it from us
kill them kill them kill them both
shh quiet mustnt wake them
mustnt ruin it now
but they knows
they knows
they suspects us
whats it saying my precious my love
is sméagol losing his nerve
no not
never sméagol hates nasty hobbitses
sméagol wants to see them dead
and we will
sméagol did it once
he can do it again
its ours
ours
we must get the precious
we must get it back
patience patience my love
first we must lead them to her
we lead them to the winding stair
yes the stairs and then
up up up up
up the stairs we go
until we come to the tunnel
and when they go in
theres no coming out
shes always hungry
she always needs to feed
she must eat
all she gets is filthy orcses
and they doesnt taste very nice
does they precious
no
not very nice at all my love
she hungers for sweeter meats
hobbit meat
and when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes
then we will find it
and take it for me
for us
yes we meant for us
gollum gollum
the precious will be ours
once the hobbitses are dead
you treacherous little toad
no no master
no sam leave him alone
i heard it from his own mouth
he means to murder us
never sméagol wouldnt hurt a fly
hes a horrid fat hobbit
who hates sméagol
and who makes up nasty lies
you miserable little maggot
ill stove your head in
sam
call me a liar youre a liar
you scare him off were lost
i dont care i cant do it mr frodo
i wont wait around for him to kill us
im not sending him away
you dont see it do you
hes a villain
we cant do this by ourselves sam
not without a guide
i need you on my side
im on your side mr frodo
i know sam i know
trust me
come sméagol
the stars are veiled
something stirs in the east
a sleepless malice
the eye of the enemy is moving
what are you doing
pippin
pippin
pippin
what are you mad
i just want to look at it
just one more time
put it back
pippin
no
pippin
he is here
i see you
pippin
help gandalf help
someone help him
pippin
fool of a took
look at me
gandalf forgive me
look at me
what did you see
a tree
there was a white tree
in a courtyard of stone
it was dead
the city was burning
minas tirith is that what you saw
i saw
i saw him
i could hear his voice in my head
and what did you tell him
speak
he asked me my name
i didnt answer
he hurt me
what did you tell him
about frodo and the ring
there was no lie in pippins eyes
a fool
but an honest fool he remains
he told sauron nothing
of frodo and the ring
weve been strangely fortunate
pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemys plan
sauron moves to strike
the city of minas tirith
his defeat at helms deep
showed our enemy one thing
he knows the heir of elendil
has come forth
men are not as weak as he supposed
there is courage still strength
enough perhaps to challenge him
sauron fears this
he will not risk the peoples of
middleearth uniting under one banner
he will raze minas tirith
to the ground
before he sees a king
return to the throne of men
if the beacons of gondor are lit
rohan must be ready for war
tell me
why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours
what do we owe gondor
i will go
no
they must be warned
they will be
you must come to minas tirith
by another road
follow the river
and look to the black ships
understand this
things are now in motion
that cannot be undone
i ride for minas tirith
and i wont be going alone
of all the inquisitive hobbits
peregrin took you are the worst
hurry hurry
where are we going
why did you look
why do you always have to look
i dont know i cant help it
you never can
im sorry all right
i wont do it again
dont you understand
the enemy thinks you have the ring
hes going to be looking for you pip
they have to get you out of here
and you youre coming with me
merry
come on
how far is minas tirith
three days ride as the nazgûl flies
and you better hope we dont have
one of those on our tail
here
something for the road
the last of the longbottom leaf
i know youve run out
you smoke too much pippin
but but well see each other soon
wont we
i dont know
i dont know whats going to happen
merry
run shadowfax
show us the meaning of haste
merry
merry
take her by the safest road
a ship lies anchored
in the grey havens
it waits to carry her across the sea
the last journey of arwen undómiel
there is nothing for you here
only death
lady arwen
we cannot delay
my lady
tell me what you have seen
arwen
you have the gift of foresight
what did you see
i looked into your future
and i saw death
but there is also life
you saw there was a child
you saw my son
that future is almost gone
but it is not lost
nothing is certain
some things are certain
if i leave him now
i will regret it forever
it is time
from the ashes a fire shall be woken
a light from the shadow shall spring
renewed shall be blade that was broken
the crownless again shall be king
reforge the sword
your hands are cold
the life of the eldar is leaving you
this was my choice
whether by your will or not
there is no ship now
that can bear me hence
weve just passed
into the realm of gondor
minas tirith
city of kings
make way
its the tree
gandalf gandalf
yes the white tree of gondor
the tree of the king
lord denethor however
is not king
he is a steward only
a caretaker of the throne
now listen carefully
lord denethor is boromirs father
to give him news of his beloved sons
death would be most unwise
and do not mention frodo or the ring
and say nothing of aragorn either
in fact its better if you
dont speak at all peregrin took
hail denethor son of ecthelion
lord and steward of gondor
i come with tidings in this dark hour
and with counsel
perhaps you come to explain this
perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead
boromir died to save us
my kinsman and me
he fell defending us from many foes
pippin
i offer you my service such as it is
in payment of this debt
get up
my lord there will be a time
to grieve for boromir
but it is not now
war is coming
the enemy is on your doorstep
as steward you are charged
with the defense of this city
where are gondors armies
you still have friends
you are not alone in this fight
send word to théoden of rohan
light the beacons
you think you are wise mithrandir
yet for all your subtleties
you have not wisdom
do you think the eyes
of the white tower are blind
i have seen more than you know
with your left hand you would use me
as a shield against mordor
and with your right
youd seek to supplant me
i know who rides with théoden of rohan
oh yes word has reached my ears
of this aragorn son of arathorn
and i tell you now i will not bow
to this ranger from the north
last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship
authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king steward
the rule of gondor is mine
and no others
come
so i imagine this is just
a ceremonial position
i mean they dont actually expect me
to do any fighting
do they
youre in the service of the steward now
youre going to have to do
as youre told
peregrin took guard of the citadel
its so quiet
its the deep breath before the plunge
i dont want to be in a battle
but waiting on the edge of one
i cant escape is even worse
is there any hope gandalf
for frodo and sam
there never was much hope
just a fools hope
our enemy is ready
his full strengths gathered
not only orcs but men as well
legions of haradrim from the south
mercenaries from the coast
all will answer mordors call
come on
this will be the end of gondor
as we know it
here the hammer stroke will fall hardest
if the river is taken
if the garrison at osgiliath falls
the last defense of this city
will be gone
but we have the white wizard
thats got to count for something
gandalf
sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant
the one who will lead
mordors armies in war
the one they say no living man can kill
the witchking of angmar
youve met him before
he stabbed frodo on weathertop
he is the lord of the nazgûl
the greatest of the nine
minas morgul
is his lair
the dead city
very nasty place full of enemies
quick quick
they will see they will see
come away come away
look we have found it
the way into mordor
the secret stair
climb
no mr frodo
not that way
whats it doing
no
theyre calling me
no
hide hide
i can feel his blade
we come to it at last
the great battle of our time
come away hobbits
we climb we must climb
the board is set
the pieces are moving
peregrin took my lad
there is a task now to be done
another opportunity for one of the
shirefolk to prove their great worth
you must not fail me
quiet
to the river quick quick
go go
come on
faster
draw swords
hold hold
what
amon dîn
the beacon
the beacon of amon dîn is lit
hope is kindled
the beacons of minas tirith
the beacons are lit
gondor calls for aid
and rohan will answer
muster the rohirrim
assemble the army at dunharrow
as many men as can be found
you have two days
on the third
we ride for gondor and war
forward
very good sir
gamling
my lord
make haste
across the riddermark
summon every ablebodied man
to dunharrow
i will
will you ride with us
just to the encampment
its tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men
the men have found their captain
they will follow you into battle
even to death
you have given us hope
so it is before the walls
of minas tirith
the doom of our time will be decided
now is the hour
riders of rohan oaths you have taken
now fulfill them all
to lord and land hyah
faramir
we cant hold them the city is lost
tell the men to break cover
we ride for minas tirith
nazgûl
take cover
nazgûl
fall back fall back to minas tirith
fall back
retreat retreat
come on
the age of men is over
the time of the orc has come
take cover
faster faster
take cover my lord
its coming
its mithrandir
the white rider
pull
mithrandir
they broke through our defenses
theyve taken the bridge
and the west bank
battalions of orcs are crossing the river
it is as the lord denethor predicted
long has he foreseen this doom
foreseen and done nothing
faramir
this is not the first halfling
to have crossed your path
no
youve seen frodo and sam
where when
in lthilien
not two days ago
gandalf theyre taking the road
to the morgul vale
and then the pass of cirith ungol
what does that mean
whats wrong
faramir tell me everything
careful master careful
very far to fall
very dangerous are the stairs
come master
come to sméagol
mr frodo
get back you
dont touch him
why does he hates poor sméagol
what has sméagol ever done to him
master
master carries heavy burden
sméagol knows
heavy heavy burden
fat one cannot know
sméagol look after master
he wants it
he needs it
sméagol sees it in his eye
very soon he will ask you for it
you will see
the fat one will take it from you
send forth all legions
do not stop the attack
until the city is taken
slay them all
what of the wizard
i will break him
what of théodens riders
will rohans army come
mithrandir
courage is the best defense
that you have now
here do i swear fealty
and service to gondor
in peace or war
in living or dying
from
from this hour henceforth
until my lord release me
or death take me
and i shall not forget it
nor fail to reward
that which is given
fealty with love
valor with honor
disloyalty with vengeance
i do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses
defenses that your brother
long held intact
what would you have me do
i will not yield
the river in pelennor unfought
osgiliath must be retaken
my lord osgiliath is overrun
much must be risked in war
is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lords will
you wish now that our places
had been exchanged
that i had died
and boromir had lived
yes
i wish that
since you were robbed
of boromir
i will do what i can
in his stead
if i should return
think better of me father
that will depend on the manner
of your return
ugh
what are you up to
sneaking off are we
sneaking
sneaking
fat hobbit is always so polite
sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find
and they say sneak
sneak

faramir
faramir
your fathers will has turned
to madness
do not throw away your life
so rashly
where does my allegiance lie
if not here
your father loves you faramir
he will remember it
before the end
can you sing master hobbit
well
yes
at least well enough
for my own people
but we have no songs
for great halls
and evil times
and why should your songs
be unfit for my halls
come sing me a song
home is behind
the world ahead
and there are many paths to tread
through shadow
to the edge of night
until the stars are all alight
mist and shadow
cloud and shade
all shall fade
all shall
fade
march march
march march march
make way for the king
make way
the king is here
my lord
hail to you sire
grimbold how many
i bring 500 men from the westfold
my lord
we have 300 more
from fenmarch théoden king
where are the riders from snowbourn
none have come my lord
six thousand spears
less than half of what id hoped for
six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of mordor
more will come
every hour lost hastens gondors defeat
we have till dawn
then we must ride
the horses are restless
and the men are quiet
they grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain
that road there
where does that lead
it is the road to the dimholt
the door under the mountain
none who venture there ever return
that mountain is evil
hold
aragorn
lets find some food
there
a true esquire of rohan
im ready
sorry
it isnt all that dangerous
its not even sharp
well thats no good you wont kill
many orcs with a blunt blade
come on
to the smithy go
you should not encourage him
you should not doubt him
i do not doubt his heart
only the reach of his arm
why should merry be left behind
he has as much cause
to go to war as you
why can he not fight
for those he loves
i choose a mortal life
i wish i couldve seen him
one last time
sir
king théoden awaits you my lord
i take my leave
my lord elrond
i come on behalf of one whom i love
arwen is dying
she will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from mordor
the light of the evenstar is failing
as saurons power grows
her strength wanes
arwens life is now tied
to the fate of the ring
the shadow is upon us aragorn
the end has come
it will not be our end but his
you ride to war but not to victory
saurons armies march on minas tirith
this you know
but in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river
a fleet of corsairs ships sails
from the south
theyll be in the city in two days
youre outnumbered aragorn
you need more men
there are none
there are those who dwell
in the mountain
murderers
traitors
you would call upon them to fight
they believe in nothing
they answer to no one
they will answer
to the king of gondor
andúril the flame of the west
forged from the shards of narsil
sauron will not have forgotten
the sword of elendil
the blade that was broken
shall return to minas tirith
the man who can wield
the power of this sword
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth
put aside the ranger
become who you were born to be
take the dimholt road
i give hope to men
i keep none for myself
why are you doing this
the war lies to the east
you cannot leave on the eve of battle
you cannot abandon the men
éowyn
we need you here
why have you come
do you not know
it is but a shadow and a thought
that you love
i cannot give you what you seek
just where do you think
youre off to
not this time
this time you must stay gimli
mm
have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of dwarves
you might as well accept it
were going with you laddie
whats happening
where is he going
wheres he going
i dont understand
lord aragorn
why does he leave on the eve of battle
he leaves because there is no hope
he leaves because he must
too few have come
we cannot defeat
the armies of mordor
no
we cannot
but we will meet them
in battle nonetheless
i have left instruction
the people are to follow
your rule in my stead
take up my seat in the golden hall
long may you defend edoras
if the battle goes ill
what other duty would you
have me do my lord
duty
no
i would have you smile again
not grieve for those
whose time has come
you shall live to see
these days renewed
and no more despair
what kind of army would linger
in such a place
one that is cursed
long ago the men of the mountains
swore an oath
to the last king of gondor
to come to his aid
to fight
but when the time came
when gondors need was dire
they fled
vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain
and so isildur cursed them
never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge
the very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away
the way is shut
it was made by those
who are dead
and the dead keep it
the way is shut
brego
i do not fear death
well this is a thing unheardof
an elf will go underground
where a dwarf dare not
oh
oh id never hear the end of it
we must ride light and swift
it is a long road ahead
and man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight
little hobbits do not belong in war
master meriadoc
all my friends have gone to battle
i would be ashamed to be left behind
it is a threeday gallop to minas tirith
and none of my riders can bear you
as a burden
i want to fight
i will say no more
ride with me
my lady
form up move out
form up move out
ride
ride now to gondor
who enters my domain
one who will have your allegiance
the dead do not suffer the living to pass
you will suffer me
the way is shut
it was made by those who are dead
and the dead keep it
the way is shut
now you must die
i summon you to fulfill your oath
none but the king of gondor
may command me
that line was broken
it has been remade
fight for us
and regain your honor
what say you
what say you
ah you waste your time aragorn
they had no honor in life
they have none now in death
i am isildurs heir
fight for me
and i will hold your oaths fulfilled
what say you
open the gate quick
quick hurry
faramir
say not that he has fallen
they were outnumbered
none survived
fear
the city is rank with it
let us ease their pain
release the prisoners
catapults
shields up
my sons are spent
my line has ended
hes alive
the house of stewards has failed
he needs medicine my lord
my line has ended
my lord
put it in
rohan
has deserted us
théodens betrayed me
abandon your posts
flee flee for your lives
oh
prepare for battle
hurry men to the wall defend the wall
over here

send these foul beasts into the abyss
stay where you are
we need more rubble
watch out

not to the towers
aim for the trolls kill the trolls

up quickly
set a fire in our flesh
stay this madness
no
you will not take my son from me
yah
faramir
so passes denethor son of ecthelion
drive them to the river
make safe the city
reform the line
reform the line
sound the charge take them headon
charge
cut him down
follow me
take the reins pull him left
left
aim for their heads
bring it down bring it down
bring it down
merry
i didnt think it would end this way
end
no the journey doesnt end here
death is just another path
one that we all must take
the grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back
and all turns to silver glass
and then you see it
what gandalf
see what
white shores
and beyond
a far green country
under a swift sunrise
well
that isnt so bad
no
no it isnt
rally to me to me
feast on his flesh
i will kill you if you touch him
do not come between
the nazgûl and his prey
late as usual pirate scum
theres knifework here needs doing
come on you sea rats
get off your ships
theres plenty for the both of us
may the best dwarf win
you fool
no man can kill me
die now
i am no man
fifteen sixteen
seventeen
twentynine
legolas
thirtythree thirtyfour
that still only counts as one
all right then come on
i know your face
éowyn
my eyes darken
no
no
i am going to save you
you already did
éowyn
my body is broken
you have to let me go
i go to my fathers
in whose mighty company
i shall not now feel ashamed
éowyn
release us
bad idea
very handy in a tight spot these lads
despite the fact theyre dead
you gave us your word
i hold your oath fulfilled
go
be at peace
merry
merry its me
its pippin
i knew youd find me
yes
are you going to leave me
no merry
im going to look after you
hands off
that shiny shirt thats mine
its going to the great eye
along with everything else
i dont take orders from
stinking morgul rats
you touch it
and ill stick this blade in your gut
the scum tried to knife me
kill him
argh
thats for frodo
and for the shire
and thats for my old gaffer
stop your squealing you dunghill rat
im gonna bleed you like a stuck pig
not if i stick you first
sam
oh sam im so sorry
sorry for everything
lets get you out of here
its too late its over
theyve taken it sam
they took the ring
begging your pardon but they havent
i thought id lost you
so i took it
only for safekeeping
give it to me
give me the ring sam
sam
give me the ring
you must understand
the ring is my burden
it will destroy you sam
come on mr frodo
we best find you some clothes
you cant go walking through mordor
in naught but your skin
we did it mr frodo
we made it to mordor
there are so many of them
well never get through unseen
its him the eye
we have to go in there mr frodo
theres nothing for it
come on lets just make it
down the hill for starters
frodo has passed beyond my sight
the darkness is deepening
if sauron had the ring we would know it
its only a matter of time
he has suffered a defeat yes
but behind the walls of mordor
our enemy is regrouping
let him stay there
let him rot why should we care
because 10000 orcs now stand
between frodo and mount doom
ive sent him to his death
no
there is still hope for frodo
he needs time and safe passage
across the plains of gorgoroth
we can give him that
how
draw out saurons armies
empty his lands
then we gather our full strength
and march on the black gate
we cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms
not for ourselves
but we can give frodo his chance
if we keep saurons eye fixed upon us
keep him blind to all else that moves
a diversion
sauron will suspect a trap
he will not take the bait
certainty of death
small chance of success
what are we waiting for
to the gate you slugs
move it to the gate
look the orcs
theyre moving off
you see mr frodo
some luck at last
take mine
theres a few drops left
there will be none left
for the return journey
i dont think there will be
a return journey mr frodo
frodo get down
hide
frodo
where are they
let the lord of the black land come forth
let justice be done upon him
fall back
fall back
its gone mr frodo
the lights passed on
away towards the north
somethings drawn its gaze
hold your ground hold your ground
sons of gondor of rohan my brothers
i see in your eyes
the same fear that would take
the heart of me
a day may come
when the courage of men fails
when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship
but it is not this day
an hour of wolves
and shattered shields
when the age of men
comes crashing down
but it is not this day
this day we fight
by all that you hold dear
on this good earth
i bid you stand men of the west
never thought id die fighting
side by side with an elf
what about side by side with a friend
aye
i could do that
do you remember the shire
mr frodo
itll be spring soon
and the orchards will be in blossom
and the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket
and theyll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields
and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream
do you remember
the taste of strawberries
no sam
i cant recall the taste of food
nor the sound of water
nor the touch of grass
im
naked in the dark
theres theres nothing
no veil between me
and the wheel of fire
i can see him
with my waking eyes
then let us be rid of it
once and for all
come on mr frodo
i cant carry it for you
but i can carry you
come on
aragorn
elessar
for frodo
look mr frodo
a doorway
were almost there
clever hobbits to climb so high
frodo
eagles
the eagles are coming
frodo
im here sam
destroy it
go on now
throw it in the fire
what are you waiting for
just let it go
the ring is mine
no
no
no
yes
yes
precious precious
precious precious
give me your hand
take my hand
no
dont you let go
dont let go
reach
frodo
frodo
its gone
its done
yes mr frodo
its over now
i can see the shire
the brandywine river
bag end
gandalfs fireworks
the lights in the party tree
rosie cotton dancing
she had ribbons in her hair
if ever i was to marry someone
it wouldve been her
it wouldve been her
im glad to be with you
samwise gamgee
here at the end of all things
gandalf
frodo
gimli
now come the days of the king
may they be blessed
this day does not belong to one man
but to all
let us together rebuild this world
that we may share
in the days of peace
my friends
you bow to no one
and thus it was
a fourth age of middleearth began
and the fellowship of the ring
though eternally bound
by friendship and love
was ended
thirteen months to the day since gandalf
sent us on our long journey
we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight
we were home
hi
hey watch the pumpkin
hey
rosie rosie
good night lads
hm
how do you pick up
the threads of an old life
how do you go on
when in your heart
you begin to understand
there is no going back
there are some things
that time cannot mend
some hurts that go too deep
that have taken hold
mr frodo
what is it
its been four years to the day
since weathertop sam
its never really healed
there and back again a hobbits tale
by bilbo baggins
and the lord of the rings
by frodo baggins
you finished it
not quite
theres room for a little more
bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end
that each of us must come and go
in the telling
bilbos story was now over
there would be no more journeys
for him
save one
tell me again lad where are we going
to the harbor bilbo
the elves have accorded you
a special honor
a place on the last ship
to leave middleearth
frodo
any chance of seeing
that old ring of mine again
the one i gave you
sorry uncle
im afraid i lost it
oh
pity
i should like to have held it
one last time
oh
well heres a sight
i have never seen before
the power of the three rings is ended
the time has come
for the dominion of men
the sea calls us home
i think im
quite ready
for another adventure
farewell
my brave hobbits
my work is now finished
here at last
on the shores of the sea
comes the end of our fellowship
i will not say do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
it is time frodo
what does he mean
we set out to save the shire sam
and it has been saved
but not for me
you dont mean that
you cant leave
the last pages are for you sam
my dear sam
you cannot always be torn in two
you will have to be one and whole
for many years
you have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do
your part in the story will go on
well
im back
lay down
your sweet and weary head
night is falling
you have come
to journeys end
sleep now
and dream
of the ones who came before
they are calling
from across
the distant shore
why do you weep
what are these tears
upon your face
soon you will see
all of your fears
will pass away
safe in my arms
youre only sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon
why do the white gulls
call
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
all souls pass
hope fades
into the world of night
through shadows falling
out of memory and time
dont say
we have come now to the end
white shores are calling
you and i will meet again
and youll be here
in my arms
just sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon
why do the white gulls
call
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
