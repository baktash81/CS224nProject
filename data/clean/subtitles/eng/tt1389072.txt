dr  andreas jacobsen 
thank you 
thank you  thank you  dr  pereira 
seventy five years ago  ms  nellie edvardsen 
overcome with guilt by the fortune
her late husband s family had amassed
producing mustard gas during world war i 
founded our institute
so that the wonders of science
could instead be used to help mankind 
in the 1950s 
the institute identified overpopulation
as mankind s single greatest
long term threat 
the cause of all the catastrophes
we are seeing today 
extreme climate and weather events 
and the devastating impact on
food and water security 
among the many solutions
we conceived so many years ago 
one  which seemed then so ambitious 
so out of our grasp 
has finally borne fruit 
and today  we are proud to unveil
what we fervently believe
to be the only practical 
humane and inclusive remedy
to humanity s gravest problem 
my colleague  dr  jorgen asbjørnsen 
will now present his findings 
are you ready  doctor 
yes  i m ready 
please take your seats 
please sit down 
ladies and gentlemen  please 
please take your seats  ladies and gentlemen 
thank you very much  thank you 
thank you  thank you 
dr  pereira  esteemed colleagues 
five years ago  building on the research
of our predecessors at the institute 
my team and i discovered a process
by which all organic material
can be reduced at the cellular level
by a ratio of approximately 2 744 to 1 
such a process converts a man of 1 8 meters
to just 12 9 centimeters 
a wide array of flora and fauna
were subjected in this process 
and  with the exception
of some fish and shellfish 
absolutely no side effects were detected 
please  lights 
once the safety of
the procedure was confirmed 
36 brave volunteers joined
my wife anne helene and me
as the very first humans
to undergo cellular reduction 
the process is short and painless 
with only the mild discomfort of
removal and replacement of dental
and other prosthetics 
the subjects are placed under light sedation
and after a brief rest 
fully recover within an hour or two 
once completed  our little village 
just 7 meters by 11 meters 
was placed inside a gas permeable enclosure
designed to protect us from the hazards of
weather  animals and insects 
thus  we set about to live together
in the world s very first
self sustaining community of the small 
i hold here in my hand
all of the uncompostable waste
produced by 36 people over four years 
in this afternoon s session  we will outline
our proposal for a two to
three hundred year transition
for the world to transform
from big into small 
but for now 
i d like you all to meet some
very special people  come 
bravo 
and look  there is little ronni nestrud 
the first small baby ever born 
and his new little sister ulrikke 
jorgen asbjørnsen of the edvardsen institute 
himself now only 10 centimeters tall
and weighing just 18 grams 
explained the rationale behind the invention 
that is wild  isn t it  just wild 
say  holly 
you can go ahead and put
the takeout order in  thanks 
  is that you 
  yeah 
you hungry 
i ate about an hour ago 
i didn t know when you were coming 
you knew i was bringing food 
i called you and asked you specifically 
and then you go and eat 
just a sesame chicken  i m still hungry 
did you see the news today 
  about the little swedish man 
  norwegian 
helen called to tell me to turn on the tv 
what won t they think of next 
unbelievable 
biggest thing since landing
on the moon  bigger 
i don t get it 
why would anybody want to do that to himself 
they can shrink people down
and fly to mars 
but they can t cure my fibromyalgia 
and all this fuss about the environment
as though the world s going to end tomorrow 
i m in pain 
i can t breathe  doesn t that matter 
lots of people are in pain  mom 
in all sorts of ways 
   tingling 
  more like tingling 
  tingling  okay 
this downsizing thing is simply
runaway train technology
that s having a devastating impact
on our world economy 
we re losing billions of dollars
in consumer spending already 
it s hurting us in construction  automobile 
housing and defense 
and then  of course  when we get to politics 
israelis shrinking palestinians 
african dictators shrinking
rival ethnic groups 
look  ron  in any major
transformation of society 
are there serious growing pains  sure 
but at current mass and volume 
human life on earth is unsustainable 
you know  that one guy makes a good point 
this family on my block
just moved away to get small 
now their house is just sitting there 
making everybody s values take
a dive is what they re doing
and just when i m trying to refinance 
marlene thinks i should do it
just to lose the weight 
you and me both  buddy 
hey  dee  is that takeout order about ready 
hey  honey  i brought food 
i m not hungry 
what s wrong 
i have a splitting headache 
the store was super busy 
and carla was a total bitch on wheels 
i feel like i m going to throw up 
here  let me do the neck thing 
yeah  do the little neck thing 
just relax  honey 
let me take all the weight 
okay  here is
the beautiful formal living room
with the wonderful fireplace 
and come around here  and we have
the nice big breakfast area for the kitchen 
big eating area 
and this kitchen is just a complete wow 
no  it s awesome  i just think
maybe we should look again
at that place in benson 
come on  let s just check out the rest 
this is great in here 
double oven  six burner gas stove 
it s got this wonderful
butler s pantry over here 
granite counter top   
  hey  sean 
  hey  paul  how you doing 
good 
  do i look fat 
  no  you look very handsome 
anesthesiology 
my wife says i put people to
sleep even without the drugs 
i m surprised you re still awake 
he uses that joke like twice a week 
  what s your field  paul 
  occupational therapy 
  okay 
  like career counseling 
no  it s just like physical therapy 
but focused on workplace injuries and rehab 
repetitive stress  lower back 
that sort of thing 
a lot of shoulder problems 
i m in house over at omaha steaks 
he does a lot of paperwork 
yeah  well  i get a little
carpal tunnel of my own
  from time to time 
  tell me about it 
medicine these days
is all about covering your ass 
hey  paul  weren t you pre med
down in lincoln 
good memory  yeah  i put in two years 
then my mom got real sick 
so i moved back to omaha to take care of her 
i wanted to be a surgeon  actually 
you know  we might ve ended up
working together 
you could ve been my anesthesiologist 
  how about that 
  yeah 
oh  my god  no way 
dave 
that s dave  dave johnson 
and carol 
i heard he was coming  i had no idea 
he never struck me as the kind
of guy who d go get small 
  hey  everybody 
  hi 
  hope we re not intruding 
  no 
hey  andy 
could you get carol a   
gin and tonic 
a gin and tonic 
with lime 
well  actually 
we weren t planning on coming
at all at first 
but then  you know  we started
getting all the emails 
plus my sister was having a lump removed 
she s fine  thank god 
but i still needed to see her 
so what s traveling like 
how d you guys get up here from new mexico 
gosh  it s great  yeah 
the airlines are getting
more and more small friendly 
all the seats are first class 
so  after a couple of years in florida 
we moved out to vegas 
yeah  i think that s the last time we talked 
yeah  well  vegas wasn t
such a good choice for me 
as it turns out 
got into some real bad habits 
pretty much hit rock bottom 
i ll tell you  any other woman
would ve run for the hills 
but carol  man  she s a saint 
she stuck with me 
but i really had to come clean
about everything 
i mean everything 
you know  almost 
so the decision to   
well  that s the thing 
we both needed a change 
hit the reset button  start all over 
plus  it must feel good to know
you re really making a difference 
you mean all that crap
about saving the planet 
yeah 
downsizing is about saving yourself 
it takes the pressure right off 
especially money pressure 
i m just not driven and ambitious
like the rest of my family 
but now carol and i  we live like kings 
i m still living in
the same house i grew up in 
audrey s dying for us to move 
but we re really strapped 
i mean  shit  i just finished
paying off my student loans 
yeah  well   
listen  if you ever start
thinking about it seriously 
here s my two cents 
there s a lot of small communities
cropping up out there 
but don t mess around 
leisureland s where you want to be 
best houses  best appliances  best doctors 
they book all the big concert tours 
got all the great restaurants 
the kids love cheesecake factory
and leisureland s got three of them 
and hey  i m not just saying all this for
the referral credit  just so you know 
i liked little carol 
she s got a lot on the ball 
she s reading books
she s always wanted to read 
she s taking italian 
  and she s never been fitter 
  well  they sure seem happy 
dave says he s getting
pretty good on the drums 
next year they re taking
the kids out of school
to spend six months
at a sister city in tuscany 
cooking classes  yoga  wine tasting 
the whole nine yards 
hi  saf  audrey  it s milo 
bad news 
your mortgage application at
first national bounced back 
the underwriter didn t like
the income to debt ratios 
they re a little excessive 
i don t know if you guys can come up
with another ten  fifteen percent down 
if you could maybe
boost it up a little bit   
i bet we ll be able to tell right away
if it s for us or not 
yeah  so let s not waste a lot of time 
maybe if we get to santa fe early 
we can get a massage 
sounds good to me 
welcome  everybody 
i m jeff lonowski  senior product specialist
and happy homeowner
here at leisureland estates 
you having a good time 
yeah 
come on  guys  you re a heck
of a lot bigger than i am 
make some noise  are you having a good time 
  yeah 
  yeah 
that s more like it 
so  what do you think of my place 
pretty nifty 
it s the house of my dreams 
heck  i d say this is
the house of anybody s dreams 
why  an average guy like me
would have to work 20  30 
maybe 40 years to afford a place like this 
if ever 
and just wait till you see what s inside 
jeff 
you ve got to stop inviting guests over
without telling me 
sorry  laura  i was only   
i mean  i finally just got in the tub
to relax after such a busy day 
busy doing what  sweetheart 
no end of things 
first i took a tennis lesson
and had a massage 
nice 
and then after a gourmet lunch
with the girls 
well  we couldn t help
ourselves  so we popped
into that new loget jewelry store downtown 
loget  what s that gonna cost me 
now  jeff  you hush 
i was really good 
just another diamond bracelet 
 just a diamond bracelet  
that doesn t sound like you 
you re right  i don t like to break up a set 
so i got matching diamond earrings
and a matching diamond necklace 
all conflict free and set in platinum 
how much  laura 
but  jeff  they look so good on me 
and you should see   
how much  laura 
  well  jeff   
  i said  how much 
eighty three dollars 
eighty three dollars  are you crazy 
why  that s practically our food budget
for two whole months 
putting it all together  if you liquidate
your current home  cars and other assets
and purchase the regency level estate 
remember  that s
the 12 000 square foot equivalent home
on the 1 5 acre equivalent lot
at a base price of  63 000 
then the health and fitness package 
that s  4 500 
you re going to want to get that 
it s gym  pool  sauna  steam 
hot tub and a tennis court 
then the medical procedures for two adults 
that s  15 000 
wait  does insurance cover any of that 
no  but at the regency level 
you qualify for a substantial discount 
and don t forget the federal tax credit 
  right  right 
  all right 
so  taking a look at your current debt 
your retirement and your other savings 
you are at  152 000 in equity 
people  that is a very comfortable number 
 comfortable   that doesn t
  sound like nearly enough 
  yeah 
no  see  you have to look
at this column  audrey 
equivalent value 
you re solidly inside the blue chip zone 
in leisureland  your  152 000
translates to  12 5 million 
to live on  for life 
i mean  come on 
hold on  if this is such a good thing 
how come you haven t done it 
i would do it in a heartbeat 
but my husband had a hip replacement 
so he s ineligible 
so  what do you think 
would the regency level be your first choice 
or should i show you something
a little more deluxe 
honey  why don t you just go ahead and pick 
i just want you to be happy 
that s a good husband  take a look at this 
hey  how much for the hot dog cooker 
four dollars 
i ll give you a dollar 
sold 
keep up with the exercises 
don t get lazy  look 
i laminated it for you 
so you literally have no excuse not to do it 
okay  thanks  paul 
  thanks a lot 
  you bet 
maybe someday me and my wife will get
small and we ll come down to see you 
well  i d love that  but in the meantime   
  okay 
  all right 
just 15 minutes every night 
it ll change your life 
  okay  thanks  paul 
  see you  dave 
we re here to wish paul safranek
farewell as he moves on to leisureland 
and we wish him nothing but the best 
good luck to you and audrey 
thanks  bob  thanks  bob 
and you guys didn t consider treasure island
out in palm desert 
well  we checked it out  but   
i liked it all right  but audrey thought they
were a little stingy with the amenities 
especially given what they were charging
in monthly maintenance 
and i just turned to paul and said 
 okay  you win  let s go for it  
we re just gonna miss you so much 
gina  i m gonna miss you  too 
look  it s not like we re dying  okay 
we re just relocating 
and we ll be back at least
once a year  maybe more 
  hi  dad 
  hi  sweetie 
i m sorry your mom couldn t
bring herself to come 
but she sends her love 
and we re expecting you
at the house tomorrow afternoon 
glad you could make it  larry 
  hey  paul 
  what can i get you  dad 
look  why don t i   
here  you guys visit  i ll   
beer 
  just any beer 
  great  okay  coming up 
i wish mom weren t taking this so hard 
well  you know your mother 
frankly  i was a little skeptical
about it myself at first 
say  you remember jerry gross 
i called him the other day 
he and bev retired down there 
did the whole shrinking thing
you kids are doing 
he says they re getting
along just fine  never better 
he says he feels younger every day
and that a dollar buys
a thousand dollars  worth of stuff 
of course  they need that with
all the medication bev takes 
but yeah 
no  i see the appeal 
apparently  there s zero crime 
i keep telling your mother 
yeah  it s very safe 
we worry 
when i was younger  and then i lost it 
hey 
you guys are the ones getting small  right 
that s right  my wife and i 
good for you 
no offense  but
do you think if you re that small 
you should still have
all the same rights
as the rest of us normal sized people 
i mean  like the right to vote 
  why wouldn t we 
  well  jeez  let s see   
you re not buying as many products 
you re not paying as much sales tax 
some of you aren t even paying
any income tax 
you re not really participating
  in our economy  are you 
  hey 
in fact  you re costing us money  and jobs 
hey  that s enough 
we re just having a good time here 
hey  i m just asking a simple
academic question 
you know what 
you guys should have
a quarter of the vote at most 
that s pretty generous  don t you think 
why don t you have a seat 
  why don t you take a walk 
  cool your jets  big guy 
you know what  maybe
an eighth of a vote  in fact 
and you could use a little small  buddy 
yeah  sit down 
hey  hey 
can i get a normal sized beer
for a normal sized guy 
i keep thinking i forgot something 
moving to town  are you 
how s that 
i see you re moving to leisureland

i feel terrible 
i let you down  i feel awful

i was trying to make you happy 
and i should have been

 thinking about yourself  
you know you haven t even asked me how i am 
don t yell  don t yell at me or i ll hang up 
do you have any idea what
i have been through today 
audrey  if you don t
come back here right now

i m upset enough already 
you re upset  you re upset 
i m the one who s five fucking inches tall 
i was sure sorry to hear
mrs  safranek couldn t make it today 
  safranek 
  safranek 
well  it s not a half bad idea
to scout things out and get
everything ready for her 
the net blocks a lot of uv rays 
but you still might want to put your hat on 
and any time you want to go somewhere 
you just hop in one of these bad boys 
and if they re in short supply 
well  you can always share 
it s fun to share 
i know i ve met some super people that way 
just super 
yeah  isn t that something 
over to your right there 
in that big white oval building 
is one of our seven sports centers 
that s the one that houses
the largest indoor skiing facility
in the world 
you know  relatively speaking 
and up ahead we have lake chester 
look familiar 
the barrington  my sister s
got one  she loves it 
well  sir  here is the key to your kingdom 
welcome to the good life 
they stock the kitchen with standard items 
but one thing i should
warn you about is the dairy 
takes a while for your stomach to adjust
to the milk and cheese  so go easy on it 
something about bacteria 
and be careful about the hot water 
it s on one central system
and they got that cranked really high 
surprised they haven t had a lawsuit yet 
but you didn t hear that from me 
thanks  matt 
you re a nice guy 
and  paul 
thanks for helping the planet 
fuck 
safranek 
that s me 
okay 
and now to the united states 
where for many years 
both the department of homeland security
and the immigration
and naturalization service
have been warning about the ease
with which downsized people 
from illegal immigrants
to potential terrorists 
could penetrate u s  borders 
last week s discovery in eugene  oregon 
provided new evidence to support that claim 
brian fakler brings us up to date 
this target is just one of thousands
of big box stores around the country
that import almost a million tons
of goods weekly 
most of it from asia 
last week  workers here in eugene
opened a suspicious tv box
and discovered 17 downsized
stowaways from vietnam 
14 of them already dead 
two more dying hours later
at a local hospital 
on friday  the lone survivor 
a woman named ngoc lan tran 
was transferred to a hospital
at leisureland estates in new mexico 
widely considered the country s
top medical center for the small 
doctors were forced to amputate
a portion of an infected leg 
and today her condition
is described as fair but stable 
according to a statement
from the department of homeland security 
miss tran claims to have been jailed
for her political and environmental activism
and was miniaturized against her will
in a vietnamese prison facility 
if true  this would bolster
claims by human rights groups
that repressive governments around the world
are forcibly downsizing
political undesirables 
so  do we need to review
any of the terms of the settlement 
no 
it s all pretty clear 
i really wish you d taken her first offer 
i know 
all right  well  if you could
just step back a little 
don t want you to get hurt 
as large as you can  please 
nice weather down here 
turned real cold back in omaha 
wind chill 
hey  paul 
thanks  man  you were right 
raising my monitor really did the trick 
my neck feels better  there s
no more tingling in my arm 
i would have never made the connection 
that s great  i m really glad i could help 
thank you for calling lands  end 
my name is paul 
how can i help you today 
hi  carol 
hey  pal 
why the long face 
look around you  buddy  life is good 
i made a mistake  dave 
biggest mistake of my life 
i should ve stayed where i was 
hey  hey  hey 
look  i know divorce can put
a pretty big dent
in anyone s self esteem 
and what audrey did to you
was beyond the pale 
i mean  i hate her 
i barely know her 
you may not hate her  but i hate her guts 
you  you just got to get back
in the saddle  that s all 
yeah  maybe someday 
if you want my advice 
single moms is the way to go 
they got the whole kid thing out of their
system  and they just want to party 
no  that s okay 
and if you don t want an emotional connection 
which is understandable  you can just   
well  we have all sorts of ways you can have
a good time down here  no strings attached 
just put it on the old credit card 
no  i m good  really 
okay  yeah 
in fact  i started seeing someone 
yeah 
single mom  actually 
now we re talking  good for you 
paul  this is so good 
thanks 
the recipe called for chervil 
but you can t get chervil here yet 
so i used dill 
well  whatever it is  it s super yummy 
it s the little things  you know 
i mean  except for there being no birds or
insects  you d think we re in the normal world 
and then something happens 
and you realize we re not 
not that substituting dill for chervil
is that big a thing 
but you know what i mean 
like last month  my parents came down
to visit jonah and me 
and it s this whole production
with the carrying boxes
and  of course  jonah gets freaked out
by grandma and grandpa
being so huge and scary 
one night they took us out
for dinner at fleming s 
you know  real nice 
and jonah and i are sitting on the table
in those special seats 
and the big people
wouldn t stop staring at us 
plus  the restaurant brags about
how small people are welcome 
then they charge a huge minimum 
they should charge big people extra 
they re the ones dragging down the world 
i know  big people look at us
like we re freaks 
they re the freaks 
did you hear about
all that gas being released
in antarctica from the ice 
the methane 
i haven t really been following the news
that much lately 
apparently  it s a big deal 
scientists are saying the more the ice melts 
the more methane comes out 
making more ice melt 
apparently  we re already
way beyond the tipping   
it s my upstairs neighbor 
it s the strangest thing 
there wasn t a peep for months 
i don t even think he was here  and then
suddenly it s party  party  party 
i had to call security the other night 
dušan 
hey  dušan 
dušan 
yes 
you mind turning down the music 
i m trying to have a quiet evening down here 
  hello  my friend 
  hello  dušan 
may i come in 
certainly 
so  listen  pete   
paul 
  paul  and kristen 
  paul 
  hello  kristen 
  hi 
i m sorry i m disturbing
your nice little dinner 
listen   
as i was saying  paul 
i m having one more  you know 
little party at my place tonight 
not big like last time  very small 
just a few close friends 
no 
is that a rose

as a peace offering 
look  everyone 
this is paul  my neighbor 
and look at what he brings me 
a real fucking rose 
do you think any of these
other ungrateful sons of bitches
think to bring something to dušan 
no  you re the only one  i like you 
look  i know i said it s only a little party 
but i make two  three phone calls to
very close friends  look what happens 
everybody comes 
there s nothing else to do
in this fucking city after 10 00 
now  this i do not understand 
it s not as if so many people
have work in the morning 
this is the worst trait about small people 
they re lazy 
not all  not all  but lazy 
like this lazy son of a bitch 
konrad 
what s that you re saying about me 
what lies are you telling 
just that in small world
no one wants to work 
what did you expect 
that s the wonderful thing
about becoming small 
because you re immediately rich 
unless you re very poor 
then you re just small 
konrad is sea captain 
never more than ten meters
away from his boat 
i do like my boat 
there she is  sonja  my beauty 
you see  i m from many generations 
all the way back to my grandfathers 
my father  all sea captains 
so  what brings you to leisureland 
dušan 
he even convinced me to become small 
mostly for the women and the parties 
and  frankly 
my wife had all the money 
and after she left 
things became a bit tricky 
i can relate 
it s quite wonderful
to be small  don t you think 
i d say it has its pluses and minuses 
next week i ll be in the seychelles 
and two weeks after that 
i ll be sailing with friends
for a month on lake titicaca 
can you believe i ve never
been to lake titicaca 
and how does the boat get
from place to place 
i mean  you can t sail it 
fedex  my dear boy 
sonja travels faster than i do 
how d you get a tiny harpsichord down here 
i didn t  i had to have it made 
who is that 
  who s that 
  yeah 
that s little ronni 
that s little ronni 
the first small baby ever born 
back in norway 
holy shit  that s little ronni 
yeah  you should go talk to him 
sorry    sorry  excuse me 
is it true you re little ronni 
well  maybe not so little anymore 
but  yeah  that s me 
  would it be cool to get a selfie 
  yeah  man  get in here 
awesome  thank you so much 
i really appreciate it  thank you 
thank you  so are you 
what is that 
no  i need to know  i have allergies 
wait  wait 
okay 
i m gonna take off my shoes 
having fun 
enough with the fucking doorbell 
good morning  mr  dušan 
we come clean for you 
so you had fun last night  yeah 
you didn t know you were so lucky
to have exciting neighbors such as me 
well  i ve never been to a party like that 
there were so many europeans 
did you know little ronni was here 
i mean  he is historic 
and boring 
good looking dumb norwegian guy
goes around the world
having sex with everyone 
women  men  hermaphrodites 
dogs  goats  monkeys 
he ll be the first small baby
to die of syphilis 
but  yeah  okay  historic 
well  apparently  he still lives
in the original colony 
you know  over in norway 
i ve always wanted to see that 
it s all right 
you ve been there 
yeah  i go once or twice a year 
konrad  too  we make business there 
very good business 
must be something to see 
you know you can t even get
pictures of it online 
yes  my friend  the world
is filled with things to see 
i don t know you  paul  but i like you 
i like you very much 
and my advice is 
get out of this disgusting little
fucking apartment and open your eyes 
don t be so american 
you re nice guy  paul 
but you re a little bit pathetic guy 
last night you dance  you laugh 
but inside you cry 
who are you to talk to me that way 
i m dušan mirkovic  your neighbor 
neighbors are friends 
friends tell friends the truth 
okay  maybe sometimes
i m a little bit asshole 
but the world needs assholes 
otherwise where would shit go out 
dušan  bye 
thank you 
when i think of big people becoming small 
all the new small cities in the world 
i see opportunity 
i ask myself   dušan 
 why do people  they want to become small  
to help the environment  please 
they become small to have the things
which until now were only for the rich 
which  by the way 
is the genius of the concept 
so i say to my brother  srdan   
i work with my brother 
he s still big 
my wife  too  by the way 
i say   why not bring very special items 
 luxury items  to the small consumer  
the things that nobody else
is thinking to bring 
such as 
well  cohiba espléndido  cuba 
best cigar in the world 
how much you pay for this when you re big 
45  50 dollars 
when you re small  i sell you
this cigar for one dollar 
and from this one cohiba 
we make about 2 000 cigars 
okay  maybe they re not
actually made in cuba 
maybe they re rolled by little albanians
in bujanovac  but who cares 
and this is just one thing 
there s perfume and cologne 
brandy  port  calvados  truffles  caviar 
is all that legal 
baby  this is wild west 
who has time chasing after
some fucking serbian guy five inches tall
over a few cigars and some wine 
my brother and i
are now in seven small cities
around the world  seven 
paul  listen

they want me to go there right away

it s too complicated to explain 
top secret and very urgent

hello 
  it s just such an honor 
  hello  hello 
see  paul 
jesus smile for me 
i say paul i want visit norway
only for meet you 
it s true 
  i m anne helene 
  hello 
please sit  join us 
thank you 
we re watching the world go by 
sounds great 
you have no idea how terribly grief stricken
we were by miss tran s case 
jorgen has lost so much sleep
over all the abuses 
it s humbling  huh 
nature is such a patient sculptor 
grinding a tiny bit
each day  slowly  slowly 
for thousands of years 
to make such a supremely beautiful thing 
what a waste 
what a dreadful waste 
you ll have to excuse jorgen 
these past few days has been especially hard 
such a big decision to make  and so quickly 
normally  when we visit the colony 
we like to spend
a few days in henningsvær 
but then the news came 
and   
yeah  well  here we are 
suddenly imposing on you 
we scarcely had the time to pack 
i m sorry  wait  what news 
why  the methane release in antarctica 
you must know about the methane 
yeah 
that s not new  is it  i mean   
new or old 
it s the end 
it s the end of everything 
the world has already seen
five major extinctions 
and now there will be another 
i didn t want to believe it  none of us did 
but there we were in helsinki  big and small 
climatologists  bacteriologists 
demographers  physicists  immunologists 
twenty six nobel prize winners among us 
we built all the models  did all the math
and our conclusion was consistent 
homo sapiens will soon vanish from the earth 
it is now an actuarial certainty 
no matter how the end will come 
environmental disaster 
pandemic disease  unbreathable air 
impotable water 
not enough food  nuclear winter 
some combination of them all 
relatively soon the earth will indeed
purge itself of human life
and god knows how many other species 
do you really mean extinction 
what about downsizing 
yeah  yeah  too little too late 
only 3  of the world has miniaturized 
there simply isn t enough time 
not a very successful species 
these homo sapiens 
even with such great intelligence 
barely 200 000 years 
alligator has survived 200 million years
with a brain the size of a walnut 
people have been predicting
the end of the world for thousands of years 
now it s really happening 
i guess somebody had to be right someday 
so sad 
very sad 
okay  i go sleep now  good night  paul 
good night  ngoc lan 
  you okay 
  i fine 
you know  maybe i should
take a look at your leg 
okay  yes  you look 
yep 
that peg is really making the skin chafe 
okay 
you know 
if somebody had told me 10 years ago
that one day i d be
five inches tall and divorced
helping a famous vietnamese
dissident get a new foot
while cruising up a fjord in norway
discussing the end of the world
with jorgen asbjørnsen 
i d have said he was crazy 
i m sorry 
i m sorry  i thought   
jesus  i m such an idiot 
no 
please  i want 
good morning 
good morning 
what s that sound 
a greeting 
that s it  that s the original colony 
what  and there s no net  no walls 
no  we ve been lucky 
we are too close to the sea
for the mosquitoes 
and over the years we realized
that the birds 
they prefer the lemmings 
but  yes  this is where we started
many years ago 
george  good to see you 
good to see you  welcome  welcome 
no  no   
jorgen 
anne helene 
oh  thank god you re here 
why didn t anyone tell me 
i love you so much 
i love you both so much 
ever since the decision 
i didn t feel right without you here 
and you know how i am when i worry 
i can t eat  i can t sleep 
ask anyone here  they tell you 
sorry to interrupt  jorgen 
but we need your advice  immediately 
yes  excuse us  solveig 
of course  darling 
you ve got important things to do 
dušan  dušan  dušan 
bless you for coming so quickly 
solveig  my darling 
i m always happy to help in difficult times 
in easy times  in happy times 
it s always a pleasure to come and visit you
and your lovely village 
it is lovely  isn t it 
i can t bear to think i won t see it again 
you know  i m the one who made
this colony possible in the first place 
i ve been coming since i was just a baby 
i remember one time   
wait  i know you 
you were in my dream last night 
you were a horse  or a pony 
something very strong 
and i mounted you
and rode you through a dangerous forest 
  okay 
  and here you are 
right before we leave 
another miracle 
you are coming with us  aren t you 
where are you going 
in there 
would you like to see 
where this go 
to the vault 
  the vault 
  yes 
we ve been working on it
almost since the very beginning 
when jorgen made his big discovery 
i said   look  jorgen  you re a genius
and downsizing is a genius idea 
no one is questioning that 
but what if people don t accept it 
what if it doesn t come out on time  
anyway  this is what they came up with 
on my suggestion 
torvald  be a sweetheart
and give our friends a little tour 
sure 
the tunnel leads to a vault 1 6 kilometers
inside the earth s lithosphere
and is encased in a double
layer of inconel 625 
in addition to maintaining
a broad spectrum of biodiversity 
the vault is equipped with
fields for growing foods 
forests for lumber 
livestock for animal husbandry   
the residential areas are spacious
and easily expandable
to provide for future generations 
wait  but    that s not all underground 
oh  yes 
our new small size makes it possible 
otherwise we never could have dreamed
of preserving so much of the world
in a single safe place 
this is brilliant 
i mean  isn t this brilliant 
it s like noah s ark 
yes  exactly 
it s noah s ark 
so  what do you do for power  is it nuclear 
no  no  100  geothermal 
and we have interoperable organic systems
to manage production of artificial sunlight 
oxygen  co2 elimination 
water purification  and so on 
and how long will you stay down there 
torvald  how long is it 
8 000 years 
well  something like that 
just until the surface
environment stabilizes 
it s not unprecedented
what we are doing here 
less than 100 000 years ago 
humans underwent a near extinction 
maybe 2 000 survived 
and from that handful
came all of the billions
of people you see today 
rebooting the species  it s nothing new 
yeah  exactly 
my friends 
many years ago 
when we discovered cellular miniaturization 
the world which had seemed so doomed
felt suddenly so full of possibilities 
so  until very recently 
i maintained hope
that the contingency plan
we embark upon tomorrow
could remain simply that 
a plan 
but
history has spoken 
and this is our final dinner
in the place we called home
for so many years 
yes  we are sad to leave 
and terribly sad for the reasons why 
but man is too beautiful 
too improbable a lifeform
to be allowed to disappear forever
from the cosmos 
now then 
i would like to ask the surviving members
of the original colony to stand 
look at him 
little ronni 
how he has grown 
i ask you again  as i asked you
so many years ago 
generations to come 
perhaps all of humanity will thank you
for your bravery and commitment 
but you must ask yourself
whether you are truly ready
to enter a new world 
for there will be no turning back 
are you ready 
is everyone ready 
we are ready  we are ready  we are ready 
paul 
yeah 
can you come down here 
where you go  i look many place for you 
i was just here 
i talk with mr  dušan 
he say fat lady pay  he ready go back 
i happy for that 
too long time away from
señor càrdenas and mrs  lopez
