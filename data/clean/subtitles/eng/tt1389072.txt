dr andreas jacobsen
thank you
thank you thank you dr pereira
seventyfive years ago ms nellie edvardsen
overcome with guilt by the fortune
her late husbands family had amassed
producing mustard gas during world war i
founded our institute
so that the wonders of science
could instead be used to help mankind
in the 1950s
the institute identified overpopulation
as mankinds single greatest
longterm threat
the cause of all the catastrophes
we are seeing today
extreme climate and weather events
and the devastating impact on
food and water security
among the many solutions
we conceived so many years ago
one which seemed then so ambitious
so out of our grasp
has finally borne fruit
and today we are proud to unveil
what we fervently believe
to be the only practical
humane and inclusive remedy
to humanitys gravest problem
my colleague dr jorgen asbjørnsen
will now present his findings
are you ready doctor
yes im ready
please take your seats
please sit down
ladies and gentlemen please
please take your seats ladies and gentlemen
thank you very much thank you
thank you thank you
dr pereira esteemed colleagues
five years ago building on the research
of our predecessors at the institute
my team and i discovered a process
by which all organic material
can be reduced at the cellular level
by a ratio of approximately 2744 to 1
such a process converts a man of 18 meters
to just 129 centimeters
a wide array of flora and fauna
were subjected in this process
and with the exception
of some fish and shellfish
absolutely no side effects were detected
please lights
once the safety of
the procedure was confirmed
36 brave volunteers joined
my wife annehelene and me
as the very first humans
to undergo cellular reduction
the process is short and painless
with only the mild discomfort of
removal and replacement of dental
and other prosthetics
the subjects are placed under light sedation
and after a brief rest
fully recover within an hour or two
once completed our little village
just 7 meters by 11 meters
was placed inside a gaspermeable enclosure
designed to protect us from the hazards of
weather animals and insects
thus we set about to live together
in the worlds very first
selfsustaining community of the small
i hold here in my hand
all of the uncompostable waste
produced by 36 people over four years
in this afternoons session we will outline
our proposal for a two to
three hundredyear transition
for the world to transform
from big into small
but for now
id like you all to meet some
very special people come
bravo
and look there is little ronni nestrud
the first small baby ever born
and his new little sister ulrikke
jorgen asbjørnsen of the edvardsen institute
himself now only 10 centimeters tall
and weighing just 18 grams
explained the rationale behind the invention
that is wild isnt it just wild
say holly
you can go ahead and put
the takeout order in thanks
is that you
yeah
you hungry
i ate about an hour ago
i didnt know when you were coming
you knew i was bringing food
i called you and asked you specifically
and then you go and eat
just a sesame chicken im still hungry
did you see the news today
about the little swedish man
norwegian
helen called to tell me to turn on the tv
what wont they think of next
unbelievable
biggest thing since landing
on the moon bigger
i dont get it
why would anybody want to do that to himself
they can shrink people down
and fly to mars
but they cant cure my fibromyalgia
and all this fuss about the environment
as though the worlds going to end tomorrow
im in pain
i cant breathe doesnt that matter
lots of people are in pain mom
in all sorts of ways
tingling
more like tingling
tingling okay
this downsizing thing is simply
runawaytrain technology
thats having a devastating impact
on our world economy
were losing billions of dollars
in consumer spending already
its hurting us in construction automobile
housing and defense
and then of course when we get to politics
israelis shrinking palestinians
african dictators shrinking
rival ethnic groups
look ron in any major
transformation of society
are there serious growing pains sure
but at current mass and volume
human life on earth is unsustainable
you know that one guy makes a good point
this family on my block
just moved away to get small
now their house is just sitting there
making everybodys values take
a dive is what theyre doing
and just when im trying to refinance
marlene thinks i should do it
just to lose the weight
you and me both buddy
hey dee is that takeout order about ready
hey honey i brought food
im not hungry
whats wrong
i have a splitting headache
the store was super busy
and carla was a total bitch on wheels
i feel like im going to throw up
here let me do the neck thing
yeah do the little neck thing
just relax honey
let me take all the weight
okay here is
the beautiful formal living room
with the wonderful fireplace
and come around here and we have
the nice big breakfast area for the kitchen
big eating area
and this kitchen is just a complete wow
no its awesome i just think
maybe we should look again
at that place in benson
come on lets just check out the rest
this is great in here
double oven sixburner gas stove
its got this wonderful
butlers pantry over here
granite counter top
hey sean
hey paul how you doing

anesthesiology
my wife says i put people to
sleep even without the drugs
im surprised youre still awake
he uses that joke like twice a week
whats your field paul
occupational therapy
okay
like career counseling
no its just like physical therapy
but focused on workplace injuries and rehab
repetitive stress lower back
that sort of thing
a lot of shoulder problems
im inhouse over at omaha steaks
he does a lot of paperwork
yeah well i get a little
carpal tunnel of my own
from time to time
tell me about it
medicine these days
is all about covering your ass
hey paul werent you premed
down in lincoln
good memory yeah i put in two years
then my mom got real sick
so i moved back to omaha to take care of her
i wanted to be a surgeon actually
you know we mightve ended up
working together
you couldve been my anesthesiologist
how about that
yeah
oh my god no way
dave
thats dave dave johnson
and carol
i heard he was coming i had no idea
he never struck me as the kind
of guy whod go get small
hey everybody
hi
hope were not intruding
no
hey andy
could you get carol a
gin and tonic
a gin and tonic
with lime
well actually
we werent planning on coming
at all at first
but then you know we started
getting all the emails
plus my sister was having a lump removed
shes fine thank god
but i still needed to see her
so whats traveling like
howd you guys get up here from new mexico
gosh its great yeah
the airlines are getting
more and more smallfriendly
all the seats are firstclass
so after a couple of years in florida
we moved out to vegas
yeah i think thats the last time we talked
yeah well vegas wasnt
such a good choice for me
as it turns out
got into some real bad habits
pretty much hit rock bottom
ill tell you any other woman
wouldve run for the hills
but carol man shes a saint
she stuck with me
but i really had to come clean
about everything
i mean everything
you know almost
so the decision to
well thats the thing
we both needed a change
hit the reset button start all over
plus it must feel good to know
youre really making a difference
you mean all that crap
about saving the planet
yeah
downsizing is about saving yourself
it takes the pressure right off
especially money pressure
im just not driven and ambitious
like the rest of my family
but now carol and i we live like kings
im still living in
the same house i grew up in
audreys dying for us to move
but were really strapped
i mean shit i just finished
paying off my student loans
yeah well
listen if you ever start
thinking about it seriously
heres my two cents
theres a lot of small communities
cropping up out there
but dont mess around
leisurelands where you want to be
best houses best appliances best doctors
they book all the big concert tours
got all the great restaurants
the kids love cheesecake factory
and leisurelands got three of them
and hey im not just saying all this for
the referral credit just so you know
i liked little carol
shes got a lot on the ball
shes reading books
shes always wanted to read
shes taking italian
and shes never been fitter
well they sure seem happy
dave says hes getting
pretty good on the drums
next year theyre taking
the kids out of school
to spend six months
at a sister city in tuscany
cooking classes yoga wine tasting
the whole nine yards
hi saf audrey its milo
bad news
your mortgage application at
first national bounced back
the underwriter didnt like
the incometodebt ratios
theyre a little excessive
i dont know if you guys can come up
with another ten fifteen percent down
if you could maybe
boost it up a little bit
i bet well be able to tell right away
if its for us or not
yeah so lets not waste a lot of time
maybe if we get to santa fe early
we can get a massage
sounds good to me
welcome everybody
im jeff lonowski senior product specialist
and happy homeowner
here at leisureland estates
you having a good time
yeah
come on guys youre a heck
of a lot bigger than i am
make some noise are you having a good time
yeah
yeah
thats more like it
so what do you think of my place
pretty nifty
its the house of my dreams
heck id say this is
the house of anybodys dreams
why an average guy like me
would have to work 20 30
maybe 40 years to afford a place like this
if ever
and just wait till you see whats inside
jeff
youve got to stop inviting guests over
without telling me
sorry laura i was only
i mean i finally just got in the tub
to relax after such a busy day
busy doing what sweetheart
no end of things
first i took a tennis lesson
and had a massage
nice
and then after a gourmet lunch
with the girls
well we couldnt help
ourselves so we popped
into that new loget jewelry store downtown
loget whats that gonna cost me
now jeff you hush
i was really good
just another diamond bracelet
just a diamond bracelet
that doesnt sound like you
youre right i dont like to break up a set
so i got matching diamond earrings
and a matching diamond necklace
all conflictfree and set in platinum
how much laura
but jeff they look so good on me
and you should see
how much laura
well jeff
i said how much
eightythree dollars
eightythree dollars are you crazy
why thats practically our food budget
for two whole months
putting it all together if you liquidate
your current home cars and other assets
and purchase the regencylevel estate
remember thats
the 12000squarefootequivalent home
on the 15acreequivalent lot
at a base price of 63000
then the health and fitness package
thats 4500
youre going to want to get that
its gym pool sauna steam
hot tub and a tennis court
then the medical procedures for two adults
thats 15000
wait does insurance cover any of that
no but at the regency level
you qualify for a substantial discount
and dont forget the federal tax credit
right right
all right
so taking a look at your current debt
your retirement and your other savings
you are at 152000 in equity
people that is a very comfortable number
comfortable that doesnt
sound like nearly enough
yeah
no see you have to look
at this column audrey
equivalent value
youre solidly inside the blue chip zone
in leisureland your 152000
translates to 125 million
to live on for life
i mean come on
hold on if this is such a good thing
how come you havent done it
i would do it in a heartbeat
but my husband had a hip replacement
so hes ineligible
so what do you think
would the regency level be your first choice
or should i show you something
a little more deluxe
honey why dont you just go ahead and pick
i just want you to be happy
thats a good husband take a look at this
hey how much for the hot dog cooker
four dollars
ill give you a dollar
sold
keep up with the exercises
dont get lazy look
i laminated it for you
so you literally have no excuse not to do it
okay thanks paul
thanks a lot
you bet
maybe someday me and my wife will get
small and well come down to see you
well id love that but in the meantime
okay
all right
just 15 minutes every night
itll change your life
okay thanks paul
see you dave
were here to wish paul safranek
farewell as he moves on to leisureland
and we wish him nothing but the best
good luck to you and audrey
thanks bob thanks bob
and you guys didnt consider treasure island
out in palm desert
well we checked it out but
i liked it all right but audrey thought they
were a little stingy with the amenities
especially given what they were charging
in monthly maintenance
and i just turned to paul and said
okay you win lets go for it
were just gonna miss you so much
gina im gonna miss you too
look its not like were dying okay
were just relocating
and well be back at least
once a year maybe more
hi dad
hi sweetie
im sorry your mom couldnt
bring herself to come
but she sends her love
and were expecting you
at the house tomorrow afternoon
glad you could make it larry
hey paul
what can i get you dad
look why dont i
here you guys visit ill
beer
just any beer
great okay coming up
i wish mom werent taking this so hard
well you know your mother
frankly i was a little skeptical
about it myself at first
say you remember jerry gross
i called him the other day
he and bev retired down there
did the whole shrinking thing
you kids are doing
he says theyre getting
along just fine never better
he says he feels younger every day
and that a dollar buys
a thousand dollars worth of stuff
of course they need that with
all the medication bev takes
but yeah
no i see the appeal
apparently theres zero crime
i keep telling your mother
yeah its very safe
we worry
when i was younger and then i lost it
hey
you guys are the ones getting small right
thats right my wife and i
good for you
no offense but
do you think if youre that small
you should still have
all the same rights
as the rest of us normalsized people
i mean like the right to vote
why wouldnt we
well jeez lets see
youre not buying as many products
youre not paying as much sales tax
some of you arent even paying
any income tax
youre not really participating
in our economy are you
hey
in fact youre costing us money and jobs
hey thats enough
were just having a good time here
hey im just asking a simple
academic question
you know what
you guys should have
a quarter of the vote at most
thats pretty generous dont you think
why dont you have a seat
why dont you take a walk
cool your jets big guy
you know what maybe
an eighth of a vote in fact
and you could use a little small buddy
yeah sit down
hey hey
can i get a normalsized beer
for a normalsized guy

wait
youre not leaving me here
cant you understand how i feel
i feel terrible
i let you down i feel awful
but then i realized
i was just doing this because
i was trying to make you happy
and i should have been
thinking more about myself
thinking about yourself
thinking about yourself
you know you havent even asked me how i am
dont yell dont yell at me or ill hang up
do you have any idea what
i have been through today
audrey if you dont
come back here right now
and see you all small
im upset enough already
youre upset youre upset
im the one whos five fucking inches tall
i was sure sorry to hear
mrs safranek couldnt make it today
safranek
safranek
well its not a halfbad idea
to scout things out and get
everything ready for her
the net blocks a lot of uv rays
but you still might want to put your hat on
and any time you want to go somewhere
you just hop in one of these bad boys
and if theyre in short supply
well you can always share
its fun to share
i know ive met some super people that way
just super
yeah isnt that something
over to your right there
in that big white oval building
is one of our seven sports centers
thats the one that houses
the largest indoor skiing facility
in the world
you know relatively speaking
and up ahead we have lake chester
look familiar
the barrington my sisters
got one she loves it
well sir here is the key to your kingdom
welcome to the good life
they stock the kitchen with standard items
but one thing i should
warn you about is the dairy
takes a while for your stomach to adjust
to the milk and cheese so go easy on it
something about bacteria
and be careful about the hot water
its on one central system
and they got that cranked really high
surprised they havent had a lawsuit yet
but you didnt hear that from me
thanks matt
youre a nice guy
and paul
thanks for helping the planet
fuck
safranek
thats me
okay
and now to the united states
where for many years
both the department of homeland security
and the immigration
and naturalization service
have been warning about the ease
with which downsized people
from illegal immigrants
to potential terrorists
could penetrate us borders
last weeks discovery in eugene oregon
provided new evidence to support that claim
brian fakler brings us up to date
this target is just one of thousands
of big box stores around the country
that import almost a million tons
of goods weekly
most of it from asia
last week workers here in eugene
opened a suspicious tv box
and discovered 17 downsized
stowaways from vietnam
14 of them already dead
two more dying hours later
at a local hospital
on friday the lone survivor
a woman named ngoc lan tran
was transferred to a hospital
at leisureland estates in new mexico
widely considered the countrys
top medical center for the small
doctors were forced to amputate
a portion of an infected leg
and today her condition
is described as fair but stable
according to a statement
from the department of homeland security
miss tran claims to have been jailed
for her political and environmental activism
and was miniaturized against her will
in a vietnamese prison facility
if true this would bolster
claims by human rights groups
that repressive governments around the world
are forcibly downsizing
political undesirables
so do we need to review
any of the terms of the settlement
no
its all pretty clear
i really wish youd taken her first offer
i know
all right well if you could
just step back a little
dont want you to get hurt
as large as you can please
nice weather down here
turned real cold back in omaha
wind chill
hey paul
thanks man you were right
raising my monitor really did the trick
my neck feels better theres
no more tingling in my arm
i would have never made the connection
thats great im really glad i could help
thank you for calling lands end
my name is paul
how can i help you today
hi carol
hey pal
why the long face
look around you buddy life is good
i made a mistake dave
biggest mistake of my life
i shouldve stayed where i was
hey hey hey
look i know divorce can put
a pretty big dent
in anyones selfesteem
and what audrey did to you
was beyond the pale
i mean i hate her
i barely know her
you may not hate her but i hate her guts
you you just got to get back
in the saddle thats all
yeah maybe someday
if you want my advice
single moms is the way to go
they got the whole kid thing out of their
system and they just want to party
no thats okay
and if you dont want an emotional connection
which is understandable you can just
well we have all sorts of ways you can have
a good time down here no strings attached
just put it on the old credit card
no im good really
okay yeah
in fact i started seeing someone
yeah
single mom actually
now were talking good for you
paul this is so good
thanks
the recipe called for chervil
but you cant get chervil here yet
so i used dill
well whatever it is its super yummy
its the little things you know
i mean except for there being no birds or
insects youd think were in the normal world
and then something happens
and you realize were not
not that substituting dill for chervil
is that big a thing
but you know what i mean
like last month my parents came down
to visit jonah and me
and its this whole production
with the carrying boxes
and of course jonah gets freaked out
by grandma and grandpa
being so huge and scary
one night they took us out
for dinner at flemings
you know real nice
and jonah and i are sitting on the table
in those special seats
and the big people
wouldnt stop staring at us
plus the restaurant brags about
how small people are welcome
then they charge a huge minimum
they should charge big people extra
theyre the ones dragging down the world
i know big people look at us
like were freaks
theyre the freaks
did you hear about
all that gas being released
in antarctica from the ice
the methane
i havent really been following the news
that much lately
apparently its a big deal
scientists are saying the more the ice melts
the more methane comes out
making more ice melt
apparently were already
way beyond the tipping
its my upstairs neighbor
its the strangest thing
there wasnt a peep for months
i dont even think he was here and then
suddenly its party party party
i had to call security the other night
dušan

paul

paul
you come
and you bring the rose
as a peace offering
look everyone

and look at what he brings me
a real fucking rose
do you think any of these
other ungrateful sons of bitches
think to bring something to dušan
no youre the only one i like you
look i know i said its only a little party
but i make two three phone calls to
very close friends look what happens
everybody comes
theres nothing else to do
in this fucking city after 1000
now this i do not understand
its not as if so many people
have work in the morning
this is the worst trait about small people
theyre lazy
not all not all but lazy
like this lazy son of a bitch
konrad
whats that youre saying about me
what lies are you telling
just that in small world
no one wants to work
what did you expect
thats the wonderful thing
about becoming small
because youre immediately rich
unless youre very poor
then youre just small
konrad is sea captain
never more than ten meters
away from his boat
i do like my boat
there she is sonja my beauty
you see im from many generations
all the way back to my grandfathers
my father all sea captains
so what brings you to leisureland
dušan
he even convinced me to become small
mostly for the women and the parties
and frankly
my wife had all the money
and after she left
things became a bit tricky
i can relate
its quite wonderful
to be small dont you think
id say it has its pluses and minuses
next week ill be in the seychelles
and two weeks after that
ill be sailing with friends
for a month on lake titicaca
can you believe ive never
been to lake titicaca
and how does the boat get
from place to place
i mean you cant sail it
fedex my dear boy
sonja travels faster than i do
howd you get a tiny harpsichord down here
i didnt i had to have it made
who is that
whos that
yeah
thats little ronni
thats little ronni
the first small baby ever born
back in norway
holy shit thats little ronni
yeah you should go talk to him
sorry sorry excuse me
is it true youre little ronni
well maybe not so little anymore
but yeah thats me
would it be cool to get a selfie
yeah man get in here
awesome thank you so much
i really appreciate it thank you
thank you so are you
what is that
no i need to know i have allergies
wait wait
okay
im gonna take off my shoes
having fun
enough with the fucking doorbell
good morning mr dušan
we come clean for you
so you had fun last night yeah
you didnt know you were so lucky
to have exciting neighbors such as me
well ive never been to a party like that
there were so many europeans
did you know little ronni was here
i mean he is historic
and boring
goodlooking dumb norwegian guy
goes around the world
having sex with everyone
women men hermaphrodites
dogs goats monkeys
hell be the first small baby
to die of syphilis
but yeah okay historic
well apparently he still lives
in the original colony
you know over in norway
ive always wanted to see that
its all right
youve been there
yeah i go once or twice a year
konrad too we make business there
very good business
must be something to see
you know you cant even get
pictures of it online
yes my friend the world
is filled with things to see
i dont know you paul but i like you
i like you very much
and my advice is
get out of this disgusting little
fucking apartment and open your eyes
dont be so american
youre nice guy paul
but youre a little bit pathetic guy
last night you dance you laugh
but inside you cry
who are you to talk to me that way
im dušan mirkovic your neighbor
neighbors are friends
friends tell friends the truth
okay maybe sometimes
im a little bit asshole
but the world needs assholes
otherwise where would shit go out
dušan bye
thank you
when i think of big people becoming small
all the new small cities in the world
i see opportunity
i ask myself dušan
why do people they want to become small
to help the environment please
they become small to have the things
which until now were only for the rich
which by the way
is the genius of the concept
so i say to my brother srdan

45 50 dollars
when youre small i sell you
this cigar for one dollar
and from this one cohiba

actually made in cuba
maybe theyre rolled by little albanians
in bujanovac but who cares

theres perfume and cologne
brandy port calvados truffles caviar

oh my god jorgen asbjørnsen
hello
its just such an honor
hello hello
see paul
jesus smile for me
i say paul i want visit norway
only for meet you
its true
im annehelene
hello
please sit join us
thank you
were watching the world go by
sounds great
you have no idea how terribly griefstricken
we were by miss trans case
jorgen has lost so much sleep
over all the abuses
its humbling huh
nature is such a patient sculptor
grinding a tiny bit
each day slowly slowly
for thousands of years
to make such a supremely beautiful thing
what a waste
what a dreadful waste
youll have to excuse jorgen
these past few days has been especially hard
such a big decision to make and so quickly
normally when we visit the colony
we like to spend
a few days in henningsvær
but then the news came
and
yeah well here we are
suddenly imposing on you
we scarcely had the time to pack
im sorry wait what news
why the methane release in antarctica
you must know about the methane
yeah
thats not new is it i mean
new or old
its the end
its the end of everything
the world has already seen
five major extinctions
and now there will be another
i didnt want to believe it none of us did
but there we were in helsinki big and small
climatologists bacteriologists
demographers physicists immunologists
twentysix nobel prize winners among us
we built all the models did all the math
and our conclusion was consistent
homo sapiens will soon vanish from the earth
it is now an actuarial certainty
no matter how the end will come
environmental disaster
pandemic disease unbreathable air
impotable water
not enough food nuclear winter
some combination of them all
relatively soon the earth will indeed
purge itself of human life
and god knows how many other species
do you really mean extinction
what about downsizing
yeah yeah too little too late
only 3 of the world has miniaturized
there simply isnt enough time
not a very successful species
these homo sapiens
even with such great intelligence
barely 200000 years
alligator has survived 200 million years
with a brain the size of a walnut
people have been predicting
the end of the world for thousands of years
now its really happening
i guess somebody had to be right someday
so sad
very sad
okay i go sleep now good night paul
good night ngoc lan
you okay
i fine
you know maybe i should
take a look at your leg
okay yes you look
yep
that peg is really making the skin chafe
okay
you know
if somebody had told me 10 years ago
that one day id be
five inches tall and divorced
helping a famous vietnamese
dissident get a new foot
while cruising up a fjord in norway
discussing the end of the world
with jorgen asbjørnsen
id have said he was crazy
im sorry
im sorry i thought
jesus im such an idiot
no
please i want
good morning
good morning
whats that sound
a greeting
thats it thats the original colony
what and theres no net no walls
no weve been lucky
we are too close to the sea
for the mosquitoes
and over the years we realized
that the birds
they prefer the lemmings
but yes this is where we started
many years ago
george good to see you
good to see you welcome welcome
no no
jorgen
annehelene
oh thank god youre here
why didnt anyone tell me
i love you so much
i love you both so much
ever since the decision
i didnt feel right without you here
and you know how i am when i worry
i cant eat i cant sleep
ask anyone here they tell you
sorry to interrupt jorgen
but we need your advice immediately
yes excuse us solveig
of course darling
youve got important things to do
dušan dušan dušan
bless you for coming so quickly
solveig my darling
im always happy to help in difficult times
in easy times in happy times
its always a pleasure to come and visit you
and your lovely village
it is lovely isnt it
i cant bear to think i wont see it again
you know im the one who made
this colony possible in the first place
ive been coming since i was just a baby
i remember one time
wait i know you
you were in my dream last night
you were a horse or a pony
something very strong
and i mounted you
and rode you through a dangerous forest
okay
and here you are
right before we leave
another miracle
you are coming with us arent you
where are you going
in there
would you like to see
where this go
to the vault
the vault
yes
weve been working on it
almost since the very beginning
when jorgen made his big discovery
i said look jorgen youre a genius
and downsizing is a genius idea
no one is questioning that
but what if people dont accept it
what if it doesnt come out on time
anyway this is what they came up with
on my suggestion
torvald be a sweetheart
and give our friends a little tour
sure
the tunnel leads to a vault 16 kilometers
inside the earths lithosphere
and is encased in a double
layer of inconel 625
in addition to maintaining
a broad spectrum of biodiversity
the vault is equipped with
fields for growing foods
forests for lumber
livestock for animal husbandry
the residential areas are spacious
and easily expandable
to provide for future generations
wait but thats not all underground
oh yes
our new small size makes it possible
otherwise we never could have dreamed
of preserving so much of the world
in a single safe place
this is brilliant
i mean isnt this brilliant
its like noahs ark
yes exactly
its noahs ark
so what do you do for power is it nuclear
no no 100 geothermal
and we have interoperable organic systems
to manage production of artificial sunlight
oxygen co2 elimination
water purification and so on
and how long will you stay down there
torvald how long is it
8000 years
well something like that
just until the surface
environment stabilizes
its not unprecedented
what we are doing here
less than 100000 years ago
humans underwent a near extinction
maybe 2000 survived
and from that handful
came all of the billions
of people you see today
rebooting the species its nothing new
yeah exactly
my friends
many years ago
when we discovered cellular miniaturization
the world which had seemed so doomed
felt suddenly so full of possibilities
so until very recently
i maintained hope
that the contingency plan
we embark upon tomorrow
could remain simply that
a plan
but
history has spoken
and this is our final dinner
in the place we called home
for so many years
yes we are sad to leave
and terribly sad for the reasons why
but man is too beautiful
too improbable a lifeform
to be allowed to disappear forever
from the cosmos
now then
i would like to ask the surviving members
of the original colony to stand
look at him
little ronni
how he has grown
i ask you again as i asked you
so many years ago
generations to come
perhaps all of humanity will thank you
for your bravery and commitment
but you must ask yourself
whether you are truly ready
to enter a new world
for there will be no turning back
are you ready
is everyone ready
we are ready we are ready we are ready
paul
yeah
can you come down here
where you go i look many place for you
i was just here
i talk with mr dušan
he say fat lady pay he ready go back
i happy for that
too long time away from
señor càrdenas and mrs lopez
i worry too much for them
ngoc lan you cant just be
worried for a few little people
thousands of miles away
you have to look at the big picture
why you say like this
well because mr càrdenas and mrs lopez
they dont stand a chance
none of us do
its over
you want go with them
and i want you to come with me
you crazy man
always i know you stupid
now i see you crazy too
how am i crazy you heard them
this is the only chance for
the survival of our species
thats huge
you want to help people
these are the people
that you should be helping
the future of humanity is down that hole
who you help down there
people here need help not down stupid hole
mr dušan mr konrad
talk to crazy paul
he want go down hole me go with him
paul paul paul
why you want to do such a silly thing
dušan these people are actually trying
to do something to save the human race
i want to be a part of that
okay fine you want to help
then do what i did give them a semen sample
i did it too
a much more pleasant way to help
if im not supposed to be
a part of this thing
then what am i doing here
why didnt i become a doctor
why did i downsize
why did my wife abandon me
dušan how did you just happen
to be my neighbor
and ngoc lan why are you the only person
who survived that box
and you just happen to be
cleaning dušans place on that day
and had you not lost your leg
i wouldnt have tried to help you
which as usual i screwed up
and why did i screw it up
so that i could be here
right at the exact moment
to go down into that tunnel
i finally have a chance
to do something that matters
paul come on now you talking crazy
these people theyre wonderful but
its like a cult
its a cult
and the extinction its not gonna happen
for you know maybe a few hundred years
has nothing to do with you forget it
besides you think they wont behave
like people always behave
theyre all going to go insane
down there and kill each other
they go extinct long before we do
dont worry darling
he said it himself
nothing he ever wants to do works out
its a beautiful day huh
i mean knowing this is the last time
ill see the real sun
