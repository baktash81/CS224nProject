to be a wwe superstar
you have to have two things
number one
you gotta have the skills
and number two
you have to have the spark
now skills
thats obvious right
you gotta be able to wrestle
the spark well
thats the magic dust
its what the audience
falls in love with
its why they buy your poster
its why they
come back every week
its why they chant your name
its why they buy
a sixinch
action figure of you
do you see yourself
as a sixinch action figure
yeah yes i do
i see myself as wwe champion
ding ding ding
bingo guys
thats exactly right thats
called a great attitude
and thats a big plate of yes
that is one of the biggest
requirements
that you have to have
to be a wwe superstar
and you dont have
any of the other things
but the attitudes the one
thing youre in control over
and the attitudes the one
thing that you have
name
zak zodiac
sounds a little bit like
a dancer at a male strip club
why do you wanna wrestle
i wanna be a wrestler because
since i was three years old
i could name
every single wwe wrestler
just by looking
at their boots
and ive wanted to be
one ever since
im passionate
im determined
and im the toughest
bastard in any room
including this one
oh probably shouldnt swear
not when theres
ladies present

of a witch
from a tv show that i like
so you liked the name off
the show and then you took it

been wrestling since i was 13
my whole family wrestles

good morning coach
welcome to promo class
now as you all know
wrestling is storytelling
it is soap opera in spandex
good versus evil
babyface versus heel
we do a lot
of our storytelling
in the ring with wrestling
but equally as important
you must be able
to storytell on the mic
this is an essential part
of being able
to get over with the fans
this is your opportunity
to let them know who you are
tell them what youre about
the wwe can put you
on the main roster
but only the fans
can keep you there
who wants to go first
my name is jerilynn
and i may look like
the girl next door
but underneath this
is a firecracker
and i am going to blow you
excuse me
out of the water
my 10yearold just
asked me some questions
i dont wanna answer
lets put it together
yeah
lets keep it one
of course
my name is augustus heights
augustus
augustus heights
are you a polo player

how did you come up
with augustus heights
its my name
is it really
yeah
okay lets go again
my name is augustus heights
are you a guy whos going
to inherit a beer company
no
lets come up
with a wrestling name
augustus heights
feels like a guy
whos gonna politely
ask me for some butter
my name is paige
and i am all the rage
girls wanna be me
guys wanna get to know me
may sound like bragging
but it aint if its true
it aint about the size
of the dog in the fight
its about the size
of the fight in the dog
and this dog
is about to bite hard
i love it
yeah
when i heard it 20 years ago
those are like lines
you could get off a dixie cup
well people liked it
in norwich so
yeah but here
they have cable
and running water
and electricity
and they wouldve heard
their 5yearold brother
use it at a dinner table
you go out and you take that
in front of
a live crowd here
its like throwing a pork chop
to a bunch of hyenas
theyre gonna chew you up
you gotta find something
thats specific to you
something that only
you can say
all right lets go next
my name is nick barnes
for those of you who dont
know me let me fill you in
where i come from
you have to work hard
to get what you want
but what i see here is a bunch
of lazy wannabe wrestlers
i say do it
do it yeah

and i swear ill give you
more than a receipt
i wasnt talking about you
you are so fake
no one was talking about you
oh my god
i saw you
we werent talking about you
what do you think im stupid
ive been sat right there
just watching you
were talking about her
who is she
my daughter
who i havent seen in four
months because im here
putting up with your shit
so she can have a better life
i didnt know
you had a daughter
no you dont know
anything about me
or them or about our lives
or why were here
well you never told me
you never asked
why would you
were just
tits and ass right
well
the girls took a vote
youre the homecoming queen
thanks
how do you think
this ends for you
on the main roster
divas champion
you realize that today
was about proving
that you deserve that
right
ill start proving myself
when you put me
with real wrestlers
wrestlers like my brother
your brothers a journeyman
no
yes
no
there are stars
and theres journeymen
who take the hits
that make the stars look good
and your brothers
a journeyman
hes the punching bag
hes the guy with the bad
shorts with no fanfare
no you bring him here
i bring him out here
and then what
we put him on the road
for 200 days a year
hes chasing fame thats
never gonna come to him
his wife starts screwing
the garbage man
cause hes never around
his kid cant remember
his face and for what
maybe hed get a shot
at a payperview event
and he would try so hard
to make an impression
hed probably let
a real star
throw him off a 30foot cage
onto a concrete floor
have his shoulder bone
just kinda splice right
through his rotator cuff
tear it clean in half
and then the doctor would say
thats it your
wrestling career is over
but why quit then
he wouldnt stop
so then the wife would
leave him and take the kid
and then he would just keep
chasing the pipe dream
until hed end up
4000 miles away
from anyone
that ever loved him
hed be bitter
and hed be mean
and hed be all by himself
just wishing that god
he could get his kid
to return his phone call
is that the life that you want
for your brother
no i know that
wouldnt happen to zak
i didnt think
that would happen to me
we didnt sign your brother
and we shouldnt
have signed you
youre weak in your body
and your spirits weak
you think its tough now
this is only gonna get harder
you should go home
wrestle with your family
and be happy
thats how this ends for ya
its gonna be
four grand up love

well guys
today marks day number 295
in the historic
divas championship reign
of aj
last night she outlasted
13 other divas
to retain the title
at wrestlemania
and guys i still
dont know how she did it
she keeps
finding ways to win
she on yet
for 295 days
i have been
your divas champion
the longest reigning
divas champion
of all time
well this right here is
a very
interesting development
but that young lady
is paige
shes from norwitch england
norwich
and she comes to us
from nxt
certainly different
and this is a huge
opportunity for paige
to impress
this crowd here tonight
aj doesnt look
too happy to see paige
a capacity crowd
in new orleans
millions watching
around the world
under the bright lights
of monday night raw
im sorry
is it halloween already
who the hell are you
well you can understand
paige being
shes frozen
a bit hesitant here
come on darling
but these wwe fans
will turn on her quick
do something
tell you what
why dont i do to you
what i did
to every single diva
last night
i think we should have
a match right now
and as a special
post wrestlemania treat
i will put my title
on the line
paige isnt ready
i mean
paige came from a
wrestling family in england
but she oh
she wasnt ready
for a match tonight
come on ray get up
paige needs to do
something here
or shes gonna
let this opportunity
slip through her fingers
this is my house freak
yes
come on
yes
yeah
suck on that bitch
mmmhmm
sorry
and this could be
paiges moment
shes heading up
to the top rope right there
aj lee has turned
this match around
this doesnt end well
top rope
aj on the top rope
aj takin out paige
oh man wow
i dont think paige knows
where shes at
and now
the divas champion
crawling toward paige
hooks the leg
one two
and its over
oh a kickout
last moment kickout by paige
hair
and this has just
angered aj
aj with a kick
to the midsection
its the black widow
the submission move
thats taken out
so many divas
paige is trying
to hang on here
but shes gotta tap out
shes gonna get seriously hurt
if she doesnt tap here
paige has gotta tap out
one two three
now the winner
of this match
and new divas champion
paige
this is unbelievable
guys you gotta watch
what happens here
at the end of this thing
watch paige
with a paige turner
thats the zak attack
she stole your move
she didnt steal it
i gave it to her
i am a freak
from norwich england
and i have dreamt of this
since i was 13 years old
and its not just mine
it belongs to my family
it belongs to anyone
who ever felt
like they are the freak
from norwich
the oddballs the outsiders
the ones that dont belong
my name is paige
and this is my house now
yes
thats right thats right
paige paige paige
