stepped out of oliver twist 
please  sir  may i have
some more advice  sir 
you want some advice 
here s the rock s advice 
shut your mouth 
what you want  what you want 
how about what the rock wants 
the rock wants you to go
out there  take no prisoners 
have no regrets  have no fear 
lay it all out on the line 
because if you
don t do that   
the rock is gonna find
your friend mary poppins 
he s gonna take her umbrella 
yeah  he s gonna
shine it up real nice 
he s gonna turn
that sumbitch sideways
and stick it straight up
your candy asses 
there s your advice 
straight out
of the jabroni beating 
pie eating  trailblazing 
eyebrow raising   
entertaining the globe 
never hotter   
talking to two rejects
from harry potter 
so that s how you
win over the crowd 
yeah 
even though this
crazy wrestling world
is a fictionalized world   
the fans know 1 000 
if you re not being real 
all right  that guy just now 
that was the rock 
the rock is me 
dwayne johnson   
just with the volume
turned way up 
the treble adjusted  the bass 
same guy 
so don t worry about
being the next me 
be the first you 
hey  are you two here
for the tryouts 
  yeah 
  yeah 
you can t just hang out
with the rock 
what are you 
make a wish kids 
let s go 
better go 
  thanks  mate 
  yeah 
  thanks  dwayne 
  you got it 
that was the rock 
insane  insane 
come on  let s go 
to be a wwe superstar 
you have to have two things 
number one 
you gotta have the skills
and number two 
you have to have the spark 
now  skills 
that s obvious  right 
you gotta be able to wrestle 
the spark  well   
that s the magic dust 
it s what the audience
falls in love with 
it s why they buy your poster 
it s why they
come back every week 
it s why they chant your name 
it s why they buy
a six inch
action figure of you 
do you see yourself
as a six inch action figure 
yeah  yes  i do 
i see myself as wwe champion 
ding  ding  ding 
bingo  guys 
that s exactly right  that s
called a great attitude 
and that s a big plate of yes 
that is one of the biggest
requirements
that you have to have
to be a wwe superstar 
and you don t have
any of the other things 
but the attitude s the one
thing you re in control over
and the attitude s the one
thing that you have 
name 
zak zodiac 
sounds a little bit like
a dancer at a male strip club 
why do you wanna wrestle 
i wanna be a wrestler because
since i was three years old   
i could name
every single wwe wrestler
just by looking
at their boots 
and i ve wanted to be
one ever since 
i m passionate 
i m determined   
and i m the toughest
bastard in any room   
including this one

not when there s
ladies present

what you changed it to 
  yeah

what is it 
uh  paige 
as a wrestling name  paige

a free sample  
no  paige is the name
of a witch
from a tv show that i like 
so you liked the name off
the show and then you took it

british girl wrestle

wrestle  paige 
been wrestling since i was 13 
my whole family wrestles 
but why do you wanna wrestle 
been wrestling since i was 13

good morning 
wrestling nerds 
good morning  coach 
welcome to promo class 
now  as you all know 
wrestling is storytelling 
it is soap opera in spandex 
good versus evil 
babyface versus heel 
we do a lot
of our storytelling
in the ring with wrestling   
but equally as important 
you must be able
to storytell on the mic 
this is an essential part
of being able
to get over with the fans 
this is your opportunity
to let them know who you are 
tell them what you re about 
the wwe can put you
on the main roster   
but only the fans
can keep you there 
who wants to go first 
my name is jeri lynn 
and i may look like
the girl next door   
but underneath this
is a firecracker 
and i am going to blow you   
  excuse me 
     out of the water 
my 10 year old just
asked me some questions
i don t wanna answer 
  let s put it together 
  yeah 
  let s keep it one 
  of course 
my name is augustus heights 
  augustus 
  augustus heights 
are you a polo player 
  uh  no 
  are you gonna
  come out in full polo garb 
  no 
how did you come up
with augustus heights 
it s my name 
  is it really 
  yeah 
okay  let s go again 
my name is augustus heights 
are you a guy who s going
to inherit a beer company 
no 
let s come up
with a wrestling name 
augustus heights
feels like a guy
who s gonna politely
ask me for some butter 
my name is paige 
and i am all the rage 
girls wanna be me 
guys wanna get to know me 
may sound like bragging 
but it ain t if it s true 
it ain t about the size
of the dog in the fight   
it s about the size
of the fight in the dog 
and this dog
is about to bite hard 
i love it 
yeah 
when i heard it 20 years ago 
those are like lines
you could get off a dixie cup 
well  people liked it
in norwich  so   
yeah  but here
they have cable 
and running water 
and electricity   
and they would ve heard
their 5 year old brother   
use it at a dinner table 
you go out and you take that
in front of
a live crowd here   
it s like throwing a pork chop
to a bunch of hyenas 
they re gonna chew you up 
you gotta find something
that s specific to you 
something that only
you can say 
all right  let s go  next 
my name is nick barnes 
for those of you who don t
know me  let me fill you in 
where i come from   
   you have to work hard
to get what you want 
but what i see here is a bunch
of lazy wannabe wrestlers 
  i say  do it 
  do it  yeah 
all right 
go for hutch 
hello  mr  morgan 
it s zak zodiac calling again 
just wanted to check up
on the tape 
we reviewed your tape 
and we were
all very impressed

no  it was a receipt 
  looked like a slap 
  it s called a receipt 
you botch a move

  all right  apologize 
  for what 
receipts are important 
it teaches you not to make
the same mistake twice 
we don t give receipts here 
i said apologize 
well  you should  they d
pick things up a lot quicker 
when i was learning 
i got loads of receipts
from my brother 
this isn t some inbred 
backyard wrestling unit 
this is the nxt 
we don t do the receipt stuff
around here 
so  if i ask you to apologize
or do anything else 
i expect you to do it 
i was just teaching her
how to   
paige  i just asked you
to apologize 
i m sorry 
it s fine 
all right  get back at it

i mean 
it s meant to be hard 
if it was easy  any
poor bastard could do it 
what s
your competition like 
hmm  all the other
girls are gorgeous 
yeah  they ve probably
been chosen
for their looks  unlike you 
  thanks  mum 
  no  i don t mean that  do i 
i just mean that wwe 
they take on models
and cheerleaders and girls
that just wanna get famous
jiggling their
tits and their ass 
they don t have girls with
wrestling experience like you 
you re gonna blow them
out of the water

five nights

next group up 
bar s been lowered 
i don t even know
if i wanna be here anymore 
talk about me again
behind my back   
and i swear i ll give you
more than a receipt 
i wasn t talking about you 
you are so fake 
  no one was talking about you 
  oh  my god 
  i saw you 
  we weren t talking about you 
what  do you think i m stupid 
i ve been sat right there
just watching you 
we re talking about her 
who is she 
my daughter   
who i haven t seen in four
months because i m here   
putting up with your shit 
so she can have a better life 
i didn t know
you had a daughter 
no  you don t know
anything about me 
or them  or about our lives 
or why we re here 
well  you never told me 
you never asked 
why would you 
we re just
tits and ass  right 
well 
the girls took a vote 
you re the homecoming queen 
thanks 
how do you think
this ends for you 
on the main roster 
divas champion 
you realize that today
was about proving
that you deserve that 
right 
i ll start proving myself
when you put me
with real wrestlers 
wrestlers like my brother 
your brother s a journeyman 
  no 
  yes 
  no 
  there are stars   
and there s journeymen
who take the hits   
that make the stars look good 
and your brother s
a journeyman 
he s the punching bag 
he s the guy with the bad
shorts with no fanfare 
no  you bring him here   
i bring him out here
and then what 
we put him on the road
for 200 days a year 
he s chasing fame that s
never gonna come to him 
his wife starts screwing
the garbage man
 cause he s never around 
his kid can t remember
his face  and for what 
maybe he d get a shot
at a pay per view event 
and he would try so hard
to make an impression   
he d probably let
a real star   
throw him off a 30 foot cage
onto a concrete floor 
have his shoulder bone   
just kinda splice right
through his rotator cuff   
tear it clean in half 
and then the doctor would say 
 that s it  your
wrestling career is over  
but why quit then 
he wouldn t stop 
so then the wife would
leave him and take the kid 
and then  he would just keep
chasing the pipe dream   
until he d end up
4 000 miles away
from anyone
that ever loved him 
he d be bitter 
and he d be mean 
and he d be all by himself   
just wishing that  god 
he could get his kid
to return his phone call 
is that the life that you want
for your brother 
no  i know that
wouldn t happen to zak 
i didn t think
that would happen to me 
we didn t sign your brother 
and we shouldn t
have signed you 
you re weak in your body   
and your spirit s weak 
you think it s tough now 
this is only gonna get harder 
you should go home 
wrestle with your family
and be happy 
that s how this ends for ya 
it s gonna be
four grand up  love 
there s a big buzz about
the christmassacre  you know 
i m thinking
that i might have to do
maybe two nights  babe 
if you can hang around 
bloody hell 
look at that tan 
willy wonka called  he needs
you back at the factory

the divas champion  aj lee 
well  guys 
today marks day number 295   
in the historic
divas championship reign
of aj 
last night  she outlasted
13 other divas   
to retain the title
at wrestlemania 
and  guys  i still
don t know how she did it 
she keeps
finding ways to win 
she on yet 
for 295 days   
i have been
your divas champion 
the longest reigning
divas champion   
of all time 
well  this right here is
a very
interesting development 
but that young lady   
   is paige 
  she s from norwitch  england 
  norwich 
and she comes to us
from nxt 
certainly different 
and this is a huge
opportunity for paige
to impress
this crowd here tonight 
aj doesn t look
too happy to see paige 
a capacity crowd
in new orleans   
millions watching
around the world   
under the bright lights
of monday night raw 
i m sorry 
is it halloween already 
who the hell are you 
well  you can understand
paige being   
she s frozen 
     a bit hesitant here 
  come on  darling 
but these wwe fans
will turn on her quick 
do something 
tell you what 
why don t i do to you
what i did
to every single diva
last night 
i think we should have
a match right now 
and as a special
post  wrestlemania treat   
i will put my title
on the line 
paige isn t ready 
i mean   
paige came from a
wrestling family in england   
but she    oh 
she wasn t ready
for a match tonight 
come on  ray  get up 
paige needs to do
something here   
or she s gonna
let this opportunity
slip through her fingers 
this is my house  freak 
  yes 
  come on 
yes 
yeah 
suck on that  bitch 
mmm hmm 
sorry 
and this could be
paige s moment 
she s heading up
to the top rope right there 
aj lee has turned
this match around 
this doesn t end well 
top rope 
aj on the top rope 
aj takin  out paige 
oh  man  wow 
i don t think paige knows
where she s at 
and now 
the divas champion
crawling toward paige 
hooks the leg 
  one  two 
  and it s over 
oh  a kick out 
last moment kick out by paige 
hair 
and this has just
angered aj 
aj with a kick
to the midsection 
it s the black widow 
the submission move   
that s taken out
so many divas 
paige is trying
to hang on here   
but she s gotta tap out 
she s gonna get seriously hurt
if she doesn t tap here 
paige has gotta tap out 
one  two  three 
now  the winner
of this match   
and new divas champion   
paige 
this is unbelievable 
guys  you gotta watch   
what happens here
at the end of this thing 
watch paige
with a paige turner 
that s the zak attack 
she stole your move 
she didn t steal it 
i gave it to her 
i am a freak 
from norwich  england 
and i have dreamt of this   
since i was 13 years old 
and it s not just mine 
it belongs to my family 
it belongs to anyone
who ever felt
like they are the freak
from norwich   
the oddballs  the outsiders   
the ones that don t belong 
my name is paige 
and this is my house now 
  yes 
  that s right  that s right 
paige  paige  paige 
paige  paige  paige 
paige  paige  paige 
paige  paige  paige 
paige  paige  paige 
paige  paige  paige 
paige  paige  paige 
paige  paige  paige 
  look  the big man s crying 
  sod off 
look at him 
i m not crying 
i m allergic to the dog 
  oh  my god 
  go  paige 
oh  my god 
that was incredible 
oh  my god 
that was amazing 
  you were amazing  you did it 
  you were incredible 
yeah 
what an
incredible moment 
she wasn t even ready
to be in the wwe   
and paige is gonna
leave here tonight   
the new divas champion 
that youth title should be
around my waist  or trophy 
 cause i m gonna
kick your ass 
and that s the bottom line 
 cause zodiac don t care 
my first match 
i was knocked out
in about five minutes 
if that 
i started growing up
watching it 
and i was just like 
 ugh  it s really boring  
zak would get in the ring
and throw me
about and stuff like that 
so  i always knew  like 
a couple of moves and stuff 
dad was short
on a show one day
when i was 13 years old 
so  yeah  i had to fill in
for that one slot 
and i ve been hooked
ever since 
i d done eight years in prison
before i was 25 
  mainly violence 
  mainly violence 
she was a young lady
at the time 
was contemplating suicide   
was going nowhere in life 
some people find religion 
well  me and julie
found wrestling 
that  to me 
is proper salvation 
what  what 
we are a family of wrestlers 
we make no apologies for that 
this is what we do 
this is what we love 
this is our passion 
this is gonna be our legacy
when i pop me clogs 
this is what it s all about 
i love you  i love you 
the rowdy man
that s crying his eyes out
