and best of all   
there was magic 
boombastia 
and that magic
helped all in need 
flame infernar 
voltar thundasir

easy to master 
and so the world found
a simpler way to get by 
i call it the light bulb

magic left

sorry  mom 
oh  this is the world s
longest gap year 
honey  i was
gonna do that 
it s okay 
wow  you must have been taught
by some kind of sewing master 
yeah  a very humble sewing master 
what was dad like
when he was my age 
was he always
super confident 
oh  no 
it took him a while
to find out who he was 
i wish i d met him 
oh  me  too 
but  hey  you know 
when your dad got sick 
he fought so hard
because he wanted to meet you
more than anything 
you know what 
i have something for you 
i was gonna wait
until after cake 
but i think you ve waited
long enough 
what is it 
it s a gift
from your dad 
what do you mean 
it s from dad 
i don t know  mom said
it was for both of us 
what is it 
he just said to give you this
when you were both over 16 
i have no idea
what it is 
no way 
it s a wizard staff 
  dad was a wizard 
  what 
hold on  your dad
was an accountant 
i mean  he got interested
in a lot of strange things
when he got sick  but   
there s a letter 
 dear ian and barley 
 long ago  the world
was full of wonder 
 it was adventurous 
exciting 
 and best of all 
there was magic 
 and that magic
helped all in need 
 but it wasn t easy
to master 
 and so the world found
a simpler way to get by 
 over time 
magic faded away 
 but i hope there s
a little magic left in you 
 and so i wrote this spell 
so i could see for myself
 who my boys
grew up to be  
 visitation spell  
i don t believe this 
this spell
brings him back 
for one whole day 
dad will be back 
  what 
  back  like back to life 
that s not possible 
it is with this 
i m gonna meet dad 
oh  will  you wonderful nut 
what is this 
now  a spell this powerful
needs an assist element 
and  i mean  for this to work 
dad would ve had to find
a phoenix gem 
wow 
there s only
a few of these left 
hold on 
is this dangerous 
we re about to find out 
  ah 
  what 
splinter 
 only once is all we get 
grant me this rebirth 
 till tomorrow s sun has set 
one day to walk the earth

grant me this rebirth 
 till tomorrow s sun has set 
one day to walk the earth  
 only once is all we get 
 grant me this rebirth 
 till tomorrow s sun has set 
one day to walk the earth  
 one day
to walk the earth  
 till tomorrow s sun has set 
one day to walk the earth  
barley 
i m sorry you guys

but this shows just how much
he wanted to see you both 
so much
that he d try anything 
that s still
a pretty special gift 
yeah

to pick up your cake 
that s okay 
thanks  mom 
 only once is all we get 
grant me this rebirth 
 till tomorrow s sun
has set   
 one day to

holy tooth of zadar 
how did you    
i don t know

whoa  feet 
hang on  i can help 
barley  no

i definitely remember
dad having a top part 
oh  what did i do

in your house 
whoa  whoa 
he can t hear us

yeah  that s ian 
hi  dad 
i messed
this whole thing up 
now he s gonna be
legs forever 
no  not forever 
the spell only lasts one day 
at sunset tomorrow 
he ll disappear 
and we ll never be able
to bring him back again 
okay  okay  okay 
24 hours 
that doesn t give us
much time  but   
well  we ll just have
to do the spell again 
you mean
you have to 
a person can only do magic
if they have the gift 
and my little brother
has the magic gift 
okay  okay 
but i couldn t even
finish the spell 
well  you re gonna have
plenty of time to practice 
 cause we have to find
another phoenix gem 
a ha  we ll start at the place
where all quests begin 
the manticore s tavern 
it s run
by a fearless adventurer 
she knows where to find
any kind of gem 
talisman  totem   
barley  this is for a game 
based on real life 
how do we know
this tavern
  is still there 
  it s there 
look  my years of training
have prepared me
for this very moment 
and i m telling you 
this is the only way
to find a phoenix gem 
trust me 
whatever it takes 
i am gonna meet my dad 
you hear that  dad 
we re going on a quest 
come on  guinevere 
uh  maybe we should
just take the bus 
she s fine 
anyway 
it s just  like 
this award for math 
it s no big deal 
but i ll show you
when we get back home 
hey  uh 
what are you two
chatty charlies up to
back there 
you know  i felt weird
talking to dad
without a top half  so   
ta da 
oh  that s great 
dad  you look
just like i remember 
hey  don t worry 
we ll have
the rest of you here
before you know it 
and then 
first thing i m gonna do 
introduce you
to guinevere 
rebuilt this
old girl myself 
from the lug nuts
to the air conditioning 
showing dad your van 
  that s your whole list 
  what list 
  oh 
  what s that 
i m just working
on a list of things
i wanted to do with dad 
you know 
play catch  take a walk 
driving lesson 
share my whole life story
with him 
that s cool 
oh  but before you cast dad s
spell again  you re gonna
have to practice your magic 
this book is for a game 
i told you 
everything in quests of yore
is historically
accurate 
even the spells 
so start practicing 
young sorcerer 
okay  dad 
let s try some magic 
hey  sweetie 
ugh  blazey  oh  this dragon
is always under my feet 
honey  you want some cake 
aloft elevar 
aloft elevar 
i can t get this
levitation spell to work 
maybe i could try
something else
like arcane lightning 
yeah  like a level one mage
could bust out
the hardest spell in
the enchanter s guide book 
maybe we ll
stick with the easy ones 
yeah  well  it s not working 
am i saying it wrong 
well  mmm 
you said it right 
it s just 
for any spell to work 
you have to speak
from your heart s fire 
  my what 
  your heart s fire 
you must speak with passion 
don t hold back 
aloft elevar 
no  like aloft elevar 
aloft elevar 
no  from
your heart s fire 
  aloft elevar 
  don t hold back 
  aloft elevar 
  heart s fire 
stop saying
 heart s fire  
this just clearly
isn t working 
hey  it was
a good start 
oh  gather your courage  men 
we ve arrived 
the manticore s tavern 
huh  it is still here 
yeah  i told you 
come on  dad 
that s good 
all right  listen 
first  let me do the talking 
secondly 
it s crucial we show
the manticore
the respect she deserves 
or she will  thirdly 
not give us a map to the phoenix gem 
wait  wait  wait 
the map 
i thought she had
a phoenix gem 
you re so cute 
hear that  dad 
he s a smart kid 
he just doesn t know how quests work 
well  is there anything else
you re forgetting to tell me 
mmm  no 
  happy happy birthday
  come join us on a quest
  to make your birthday party
the very  very best
  hey 
okay  okay 
so the tavern
changed a little
over the years 
but the manticore
is still the real deal 
i ll have the soup
of the day 
would my lord like
a cup or cauldron 
madam  i request an
audience with the manticore 
but of course  milord 
oh  manticore 
no  no  no  no 
the real manticore 
the fearless adventurer 
oh  you mean corey 
she s over there 
quick 
somebody help me 
these griffin nuggets were
supposed to go out
minutes ago 
that s the manticore 
oh  great and powerful
manticore 
whoa  sir  you re right
in the hot zone 
you re late  adolphus 
i understand there s traffic 
you need to plan for that 
well  maybe your mother should
get her own car 
your fearlessness 
my brother and i seek a map
to a phoenix gem 
oh  well  you ve come to
the right tavern  table 12 
i have the parchment you
desire right here  behold 
oh  that s
a children s menu 
isn t that fun  they re all
based on my old maps 
uh  now   
the great manticore
sends you
on your adventure
with a hero s blessing 
and here s some crayons 
that s very amusing 
your dominance 
but might you have
the real map 
uh  yeah 
it s  uh  over there 
that s it 
  this is perfect 
  whoa  whoa  whoa 
what are you doing 
you can t take this 
we have to 
what is that 
it s our dad  and we have
a chance to meet him  but   
but we can t do that
without a phoenix gem 
no  my days of sending people
on dangerous quests are over 
what  why 
 cause they re dangerous 
corey  the karaoke
machine s broken again 
i m sorry 
but you are not getting this map 
don t worry  ladies 
your adventure will continue
momentarily 
okay 
i can handle this 
no  ian 
miss mighty manticore 
ma am   
what are you doing 
kid  this is not
a good time 
ugh  i m giving this place
a one star review 
it s just 
i ve never met my dad and   
look 
i m sorry about that 
but if you get hurt
on one of my quests 
guess who gets sued
and loses her tavern 
i can t take
that kind of risk 
now  if you ll just excuse me 
i have important things to do 
testing 
  you haunt my dreams
  my inbetweens
please 
we need that map 
no  i am not
giving you the map 
that s it 
i am done talking 
  well  i m not 
  whoa  whoa  whoa 
you say you can t risk
losing this place 
look at that manticore 
she looks like
she lived to take risks 
that manticore didn t have
investors to look out for 
she didn t have
payroll to cover 
she could just
fly out the door
whenever she wanted
and slay a magma beast 
are you gonna fix
the machine or not 
yeah  in a minute 
okay  maybe
this place isn t
as adventurous
as it used to be 
so it isn t filled
with a motley horde
willing to risk
life and limb
for the mere taste
of excitement 
but so what 
who ever said you have to
take risks in life
to have an adventure 
apparently  you did 
table 32 said their
mozzarella sticks are cold 
what have i done 
well  it s not too late 
i mean  you could just
give us the map 
this place
used to be dangerous 
dangerous 
  and wild 
  wild 
i used to be
dangerous and wild 
dangerous and wild 
wow 
i m living a lie 
what have i become 
oh  no 
everybody out 
this tavern is closed
for remodeling 
sorry  the karaoke machine
is broken 
oh 
no  no  no  no 
no 
we gotta go 
aloft elevar 
that was unbelievable 
i mean  you were just like   
and the beam
was just floating there 
my brother is a wizard 
i can t believe
that worked 
oh  you re gonna nail
dad s spell now 
except we don t
have a map 
but we ve got this  behold 
look  on a quest  you have
to use what you ve got 
and this is
what we ve got 
best part is  little kayla
already solved the puzzle 
well  according to kayla 
we just have to look
for raven s point 
raven s point 
raven s point 
yes  the gem must be
in the mountain 
we could be there
by tomorrow morning 
tomorrow morning 
that still gives us
plenty of time with dad 
yeah  well  it looks like
the expressway should
take us right there 
mmm  expressway is
a little too obvious 
on a quest  the clear path
is never the right one 
what 
during one quests
of yore campaign 
shrub rosehammer and i
took the easy route 
led him straight into the
belly of a gelatinous cube 
only reason i didn t
suffer the same fate 
i followed my gut 
and it s telling me
we take an ancient trail
called the path of peril 
but the expressway
is faster 
maybe not in the long run 
i know you
want this to be
like one of
your adventure games 
but all that matters
is that we get to spend
as much time
as possible with dad 
so  we should just take
the expressway  right 
yeah  you re right 
but if you end up
inside a gelatinous cube 
you are on your own 
manticore s tavern
ahead on your right 
  hey 
  i m just checking in 
did you catch up
to the boys yet 
no  not yet 
but i m a little worried
because we had
a weird family issue
come up 
and  well  this just isn t
like ian to run off 
i mean  barley  yes 
but not ian 
you know  it s late 
you shouldn t have to
be out looking for  em 
i know  it s silly 
i m sure they re both
probably on fire 
  fire 
  fire  the place is on fire 
  my boys  i gotta go 
  laurel 
get it off  get it off 
get it off 
excuse me  hello 
please  i m looking for
two teenage elves 
i told you already 
there were two teenage elves 
oh  those are my sons 
where did they go 
oh  they went on a quest
to find a phoenix gem 
but don t worry 
don t worry 
i told them about the map 
i told them about the gem 
i told them
about the curse 
i forgot to
tell them about the curse 
  the what 
  oh  boy 
listen  this one s gone
a little   
your boys are in grave danger 
but i can help 
whoa  hey  hey 
you re not going anywhere 
we got questions for you 
i know where they re going 
we can still save them 
okay  i think
everything s good here 
last name  manticore  
first name  the  
hold on  you re right 
she has gone a little   
it s no wonder with
a wound like that 
that s just a scratch 
oh  i m sorry  are you
an expert on minotaurs 
  manticores 
  manticores 
well  no   
well  then
you wouldn t know
that when their blood
is exposed to air 
it makes them go bonkers 
i don t think
that s true 
see  she s already losing
her grip on reality 
so  why don t you let me
save her life
before it costs you yours 
  okay 
  thank you 
could we have a little privacy
here  please 
just lie back 
that s good 
but get your head
a little bit higher 
just don t take too long
back there  okay 
hey  you hear me 
i said don t take
too long back there 
because   
all right 
how do we help my boys 
ooh  i m gonna like you 
radio 
headlights  brakes 
tires  rims 
i mean  it s hard
to tell now  dad 
before i replaced
her parts 
guinevere was actually
kind of a piece of junk 
looks like we re not gonna get
to do everything today  dad 
that s okay 
i just wanna meet you 
but don t worry  we ll 
uh  have you fixed up
and back home to see

bit more advanced 
not only do you have to
speak from your heart s fire 
but now you also have to
follow a magic decree 
a magic what 
it s a special rule that keeps
the spell working right 
this one states 
 to magnify an object 
 you have to magnify
your attention upon it  
while you cast
the spell 
you can t let anything
distract you

i don t know how
any of this stuff works 
all i know is
that everything
we ve done tonight
has gone wrong

done has been your idea 
but you didn t do it my way 
you didn t let me
handle the manticore 
you freaked out when i
talked to the sprites 
 cause you don t think
i have good ideas

all that matters today
is dad

this path of peril
is the best way
to go to the mountain

i needed that rope 
oh  but did you 
ian  look 
it s a raven 
the clue on the menu said
raven s point 
yeah 
in the mountains 
but maybe the puzzle
didn t mean the mountain 
maybe it means follow
where the raven is pointing 
it s another raven 
that one could be
pointing to another raven 
all the way to the gem 
i    i had us going
the wrong way 
well  i told you 
my gut knows where to go 
don t you  boy

barley 
she was just
a beat up old van 
come on  we gotta go 
wait 
oh  you see that  dad 
the apprentice has become
the master 
it looks like water 
so  what s the 
uh  x mean 
on a quest 
an x only means one thing 
we go to the end of the water 
we ll find that phoenix gem 
unicorns 
whoa 
cool 
this water
could go on for miles 
we don t have
that kinda time 
if we had something
to float on 
we could cast
a velocity spell on it 
fly down the tunnel
like a magic jet ski 
well  there s not
much to float on 
remember  on a quest 
you have to use
what you ve got 
magnora gantuan 
woo hoo 
accelior 
whoa 
this is
actually kinda cool 
so  what other spells
do you know 
brace
yourself  young mage 
i know all there is
to know of magic 
colt  we know
where the boys are going 
we just have to get to them
before they unleash the curse 
  the what 
  let s crush some curses 
the curse  the curse
that protects the gem
by turning into a rock
dragon or something 
a what dragon 
i can t explain it 
i just know we have
to get to the boys fast 
oh  we ll get to them fast 
we ll get to them so fast 
oh 
well  i almost had  em 
but ian  he just drove off 
  huh  good for him 
  what 
no  i just mean
he s scared to drive 
thinks something s gonna
come at him out of the   
oh  i think
i stung my leg 
laurel  what happened 
what s goin  on 
you almost
killed me  lady 
are you okay 
where did you come from 
you were
in our flight path 
  are you all right 
  i m fine 
oh  no  our transport 
how are we going
to get to your sons now 
come on  pixie dusters 
let s take to the skies 
  yeah 
  i was born to fly 
how do you feel about
exercising those wings 
uh   
boombastia 
  ah  remember   
  oh  right 
boombastia 
whoa 
yeah  you re a natural 
think fast 
aloft elevar 
yeah  nice 
careful how much boat
you re eating there  man 
we still gotta make it
to the end of the tunnel 
yeah  good point 
i can t believe
i m this close
to actually
talking to dad 
you know what
i m gonna ask him 
if he ever gave himself
a wizard name 
what 
well   cause he was
into magic 
lots of wizards
have cool names 
alora the majestic 
birdar the fanciful 
anyway 
it ll just be nice
to have more than
four memories of him 
  uh  three 
  hmm 
you only have
three memories 
oh  yeah 
barley  do you have
another memory of dad
you haven t told me 
no  it s just
not my favorite 
what do you mean 
when dad was sick 
i was supposed to go in
and say goodbye to him 
but he was hooked up
to all these tubes 
and he just didn t
look like himself 
i got scared 
and i didn t go in 
that s when i decided
i was never gonna be
scared ever again 
oh  looks like
we re coming up on somethin  
the final gauntlet 
the phoenix gem
is just on the other side 
careful  there could be
booby traps 
this place is  like 
1 000 years old 
there s no way
there could be   
oh  no 
it can t be 
a gelatinous cube 
run 
whoa  wait 
it s some kind of puzzle 
we gotta
figure it out before   
no time 
grab a shield 
  jump  trust me 
  what 
aloft elevar 
ow 
ian 
whew 
don t step on that 
i didn t touch it 
voltar thundasir 
the tile down there has the
same shape as the opening 
maybe we were supposed
to step on it 
  what 
  i got it 
no  barley 
oh  it s working 
it s impossible 
no one can hold
their breath that long 
we made it 
oh 
the phoenix gem
awaits beyond this door 
shall we 
we certainly shall 
dad  we have followed
the quest 
and it has led us
to our victory 
we re back home 
no  that doesn t make sense 
we took the path of peril 
we followed the ravens 
we went to the end
of the water   
unless the x meant
stay away from the water 
or it could be 
like  a campfire 
it s okay 
we can figure this out 
figure out what 
we re back where we started 
i mean  it has to be here 
there was a gauntlet 
i mean  unless that
gauntlet was for 
coincidentally 
some different quest 
  that s a possibility 
  what 
no  no  no  this has to be
where the phoenix gem is 
i followed my gut 
  oh  no 
  what 
the gem is
in the mountain 
the mountain
we could have been to
hours ago
if we just   
if we just stayed
on the expressway 
no  the expressway
is too obvious 
you can never take
the obvious   
if i hadn t listened
to you  okay 
i can t believe this 
you act like you know
what you re doing 
but you don t
have a clue 
and that s because
you are a screwup 
and now you ve
screwed up my chance
to have the one thing
i never had 
where are you going 
to spend what little time
we have left with dad

  through the drifting
sands of time

and you got mine
  if you bear a heavy load
  i ll be your wheels
i ll be the road
  i ll see us through
the thick and thin
  for love and loss
until the end
   cause you carried me
with you
  from the highest
of the peaks
  to the darkness
of the blue
  i was just too blind
to see
  like a lighthouse in a storm
you were always guiding me
  yeah  it s true
  you carried me with you
  from the day it all began
  yeah  you were there
you took my hand
  and when i hurt
a bit too deep
  you watched me
as i fell asleep
  and when my head
was in the cloud
  you found a way
to pull me out
  you picked my heart up
off the ground
  and showed me
love was all around
  yeah  you carried me
with you
  from the highest
of the peaks
  to the darkness
of the blue
  i was just too blind
to see
  like a lighthouse in a storm
you were always guiding me
  yeah  it s true
  you carried me with you
  oh  we ll be sitting
on the world together
  watching as the days
turn into night
  we know how to brave
the stormy weather
  and we re never giving up
without a fight
  if you should ever
bear a heavy load
  i ll be your wheels
i ll be the road
  i ll see us through
the thick and thin
  for love and loss
until the end
   cause you carried me
with you
  from the highest
of the peaks
  to the darkness
of the blue
  i was just too blind
to see
  like a lighthouse in a storm
