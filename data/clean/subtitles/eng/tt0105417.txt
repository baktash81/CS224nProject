just boom he blew this guy away
sorry im late im lieutenant souther
eddie souther
how do you do
im deloris van cartier
listen this guy was a simple limo driver
right he was a limo driver
so maybe he made a couple wrong turns
in his life thats no reason to kill him
ive never seen anybody killed before
sometimes you pass on the freeway
you see a couple of people dead
ms van cartier
youre vince laroccas girlfriend right
well you could sort of
maybe it depends how you look at it
the guy just tried to kill me so
i dont think that cements our relationship
well you realise
hes a major underworld figure dont you
hes into drugdealing
moneylaundering
weve been investigating mr larocca
for the last 18 months
weve got video tapes
weve got surveillance photos
am i in any of those videos
no no no criminal activity
the tapes arent enough to convict him
apparently theres a lot
you dont know about vince
i mean the last two people that saw him
in action kind of disappeared
what do you mean
kind of disappeared
well we found a piece here
and a piece there
but dont you worry
here have a cup of coffee
youre safe now and were gonna see
that you stay that way thats our job
if you help us we can help you
if you testify against vince
about what you saw
we can put him away
for the rest of his life
are you crazy youre telling me this guys
a mad criminal and you want me to testify
do you know whats gonna happen
hell track me down and kill me
can i call you deloris
call me anything
as long as you keep me alive
we wouldnt put you at risk
if we couldnt protect you
right
itll only take a couple of months
to get a court date
just a couple of months
only a couple
why not a year
how about a couple of decades
two months we hide you out
then you testify
no no no
its just for a little while
then you can come back
really what are you gonna do
are you gonna stick me in a bag
and bury me forget it
if you testify
im gonna put you in the last place on earth
that vince would ever look for you
nice church huh
yeah its very nice
look what am i gonna be
quasimodo in the bat belfry what is this
i want you to stay here for a while
where
in the convent
its the safest place in the world
you think vince is gonna look for you
in a convent
in the what
the convent
you must be out your im gonna go back
and work this out with vince
youre a lunatic put me in a damn
convent with these people
these people dont even have sex
deloris vince has a contract
out on you for 1 00 grand
youve seen what he can do
that one bullet thats all its gonna take
look let me explain something to you
vince knows people all over the place
you realise that
hell be looking for me everywhere
everywhere but this convent
oh come on
nobody knows youre here but me
were trying to get you a quick court date
one month two months tops
i promise im gonna spring you
as fast as i can
what am i gonna do here
im gonna go crazy here
theres nothing here but a lot
of white women dressed as nuns
what am i gonna do here
pray
pray
yes but monsignor
we are a small convent
surely there are more
appropriate places
we can save this young womans life
and imprison a parasite all in one gesture
my heart goes out to her of course
my concern would be
she might subject the convent to danger
the reno police department assures me
youll be protected from any harm
theyve promised
to make a generous financial donation
and as you know
your small convent is in danger of closing
well if they can afford
to be so generous so can we
excuse me
absolutely not i couldnt possibly
think of it this way reverend mother
shes an ideal prospect for rehabilitation
that is not a person you can hide
that is a conspicuous person
designed to stick out
you have taken a vow of hospitality
to all in need
i lied
lieutenant souther
everything is in order
no no no everything is not in order
this woman does not like me
deloris these are holy people
they like everybody
this woman doesnt like me
one month two months tops
no forget it im not staying here
behave yourself
im not gonna stay here
what is your name
deloris van cartier
is that your real name
yes i happen to be a singer
do sit down
thank you
look before we get started
i just want to say that i really appreciate
what youre doing for me
i know it must be
a huge inconvenience for you
yeah so i just wanted
to say thank you upfront
i also have always
and ive said this to people
ive always admired you people
nuns i mean you know
youre so catholic you know
i mean look youre married to the big jc
i mean youre his old lady you know
its an amazing thing to me
i mean of course you must be saying
well its much better than being
hooked up with some kind of twotiming
please do not smoke in here
oh sorry sorry you know
i get so nervous i get worked up
i just have i dont know im sorry
look ms van cartier we have agreed
to conceal and protect you
which we will do
to the best of our ability
however it is essential
that you understand
that you are not in a sorority
or a speakeasy
this is a convent a religious order
and there are certain rules
you must obey
saint katherines is a place
to commune and to pray
and i will not tolerate any disruption
whatsoever with that communion
do you understand
yes
good
but do you understand
im the victim here
do you understand im the good guy
i mean they just kind of threw me
in here with you nuns
i mean do you get that
im the good guy
i mean
i saw a guy get his face blown off
so why dont you just give me the key
to my room ill lay low
you stay out of my face
ill stay out of your face
and i will commune my little black ass
in that room
can you handle that
i think its a very good idea
thank you
well its almost lunchtime
perhaps youd like to freshen up
and youll certainly want to change
hope you dont think
ill wear what i wore in catholic school
no siree
no ugly green jumpers for me
and those stupid clunky shoes
oh this gold thing
could you have it drycleaned for me
open the cabinet to your left
you will find suitable attire
oh cool
oh no no no no
i cant do this im sorry
this is fine for covering a little bulge
but now ive got holster hips
people wish to kill you
anyone whos met you i imagine
a disguise is necessary
to protect us all
while you are here
you will conduct yourself as a nun
only i will know
who and what you truly are
you will draw no attention
to yourself whatsoever
but look at me im a nun
im a penguin
as from now and until you leave
you are sister mary clarence
mary clarence like clarence williams iii
from the mod squad
mary is in deference to our holy mother
the clarence is in honour
of saint clarence of concordia
there are three vows
every nun must accept
the vow of poverty the vow of obedience
and the vow of chastity
i am out of here with that
oh man
good afternoon sisters
i apologise for my tardiness
i would like you to welcome a new member
to our house sister mary clarence
mary clarence comes to us
from a somewhat progressive convent
however shes eager
to embrace a more disciplined life
and i am sure will make every effort
to conform to our ways
ill do my best
would you like to be seated
thank you
yes mary patrick
reverend mother on behalf of
all of the sisters here at saint katherines
id like to offer a great big hi there
and hello to sister mary clarence hi

i thought that maybe our new sister
could offer todays blessing
that is very thoughtful of you
mary patrick but i really
oh yeah yeah i could do that sure
bless us o lord for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive
and yea though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of no food
i will fear no hunger
we want you to give us this day
our daily bread
and to the republic for which it stands
and by the power invested in me
i pronounce us ready to eat amen
amen
be seated
thank you
what are you people
this stuff is terrible it tastes like sh
sisters we shall spend
the rest of the day in silence
why
only when our lips are silent
may our prayers truly be answered
then you dont have to eat this food
silence begins now
and ends at sundown
how can you eat this stuff its terrible
mary clarence
i think you might enjoy a ritual fast
a ritual fa
no no no i dont think i would
ill just put a little salt on it itll be fine
look pass me the salt over there
a fast to remind you of those
who must endure without food
no i dont want you to take my plate
and silence
how can you let them grill me
for six hours
i cant control
how long they question you

the sisters have made clear to me
that they followed you of their own volition
but they would never have ventured out
at all at night
had it not been for your example
listen they just dont want to be stuck
behind these walls all the time
these walls are the only
protection they have
the streets are no longer safe for them
and they are certainly not safe for you
these robes no longer protect our sisters
the walls do
im sorry
you really do care about them

yes i do
and i care about you and your life
i shall ask monsignor ohara
and lieutenant souther
to find a safer and more suitable
situation for you
oh no come on
dont send me away really
im just starting to get the hang of this
i mean look im not gonna endanger
anyone or anything else i swear
what about forgiveness
lsnt that what you preach
theres gotta be something around here
that i can do
thats not gonna chip my nails
or annoy anybody
youre right mary clarence
to err is human to forgive divine
you may stay
but i shall restrict your activities
to a single task

vows yesterday i know what youre up to
you and reverend mother

mary lazarus youre terrific
but we could really use some help
please youve heard us

you think you can do better
i believe id like to see that
go ahead sister make them sing

and the altos where are you
sister why dont you join them
and sopranos where are you
oh youve got to come down this way

let me have sister alma
play it one time
so we all know what were going to do
and well go from there
sister will you give me
those notes please
okay on three one two three
okay okay okay
very very nice
sister would you come
over here please
just slide right in here for me please
right here
thats a powerful instrument you have
thank you
but i think its probably a good idea
if we bring you down out of the rafters
i mean everybody wants
to be close to god
im just not sure you can do it vocally
okay so i need you to sing an octave
below where youve been singing
okeydokey
and sister mary robert
could you come stand over here please
yeah come on over
i noticed that youre moving your mouth
but nothings coming out
so id like to just hear you by yourself
if you dont mind
sister alma
could you give me an a please
alma
check your battery
give me an a please
okay wait
try this close your eyes
visualise yourself
in a room full of people
lots of silverware people dropping stuff
talking loud drunks
women with trays going
what are you gonna have
your voice has to carry over the din
you have to get up over all of that
to be heard in the back of the room
where im sitting listening
straining to hear you okay
keep that in your mind when we do this
sister
we call that an a with an attitude
thats what you need
you have to put attitude in what you sing
have to think
about what youre singing
its not just quacking this is rejoicing
you are singing to the lord
lets review those notes again
and see if we can put it together sister
basses altos sopranos
on three one two three
oh we did it
we actually sang a chord
that was exciting
yeah you sang a chord
for two seconds
the next thing you have to learn how to do
is listen to each other
thats a big key big key
you must listen to each other
if youre going to be a group
i knew that
mary lazarus as soon as i walked
in the door i knew that you knew this
now youre somebody whos
into hard work and discipline arent you
of course im a nun four popes now
four
how often do they rehearse
twice a week couple hours
not enough i mean listen to them
they really need a lot of work
they gotta rehearse every day
shes good
well do you think
they really could get better
i dont know theyre pretty raw
wet behind the ears
oh please let us try
this is gonna be hell
tell me about it
welcome this sunday morning
oh ye few but faithful
the choir im told has elected
a new director sister mary clarence
who will lead them
in hail holy queen
what do you thinks going on up there
i dont know man
hallelujah
girl groups boogiewoogie on the piano
what were you thinking
i was thinking more like vegas
you know get some butts in the seats
and what next popcorn curtain calls
this is not a theatre or a casino
yeah but thats the problem
see people like going to theatres
and they like going to casinos
but they dont like coming to church why
because its a drag
but we can change all that
see we could pack this joint
through blasphemy
you have corrupted the entire choir
excuse me excuse me excuse me
how can you say that
i worked my butt off with these women
theyve given up their free time to do this
and theyre good
i mean sister we could rock this place
out of the question
as of tomorrow mary lazarus
resumes her leadership of the choir
come in
reverend mother
i just wanted to congratulate you
i havent enjoyed mass this much in years
what a marvellous program
innovative inspiring
youre to be commended
i cant wait till next sunday
when the choir performs again
did you see the people
walk in off the street
that music that heavenly music
reverend mother it called to them
it did
i must tell the archbishop
ill send him a personal letter
describing your efforts
your bold new fight
to keep your little convent alive
and you must also include this this is
something she would never tell you herself
because this is the kind
of woman she is
sisters she wants us to go out into
the neighbourhood and meet the people
oh this woman
oh bless her
there are so many problems out there
that we could maybe help with
i mean
thats why many of us became nuns
oh its really marvellous
reverend mother
theres a lot we could do for them
besides pray sister
youre a pioneer
monsignor surely you realise
how dangerous this neighbourhood is
and you will face that danger headon
as if i could stop you
you couldnt
you have my complete support
in this matter
anything you can do to revitalise
this neighbourhood would be a blessing
dont you just love her
yes
yes the failing convent at
saint katherines has truly come alive
thanks to the efforts of its popular choir
what an amazing turnaround story
this convent was once alienated
from its surrounding neighbours
now as you can see its doors are open
vinny get over here
establishing facilities like a daycare
centre and a food kitchen for the homeless
as a matter of fact
vin you gotta see these cute nuns
im shooting pool
babe we should send them money
theyre dogooders
attribute this reachout philosophy
to a new addition to the convent
sister mary clarence
who unfortunately is a little camera shy
im gonna kill her
im gonna kill her myself
in related news the pope visits the us
and well have more on that in a moment
good morning
thank you so much
good morning monsignor
good morning
good to see you
good morning
hey hey you looking for me
what you doing here
how come i saw you on tv
that was not my fault
these people just showed up
but its been really good for the convent
youre supposed to be hiding out
remember
bullets flying through the air at you
ring a bell
yes
but i cant talk about it now
i have a show in five minutes
listen to yourself
this is not a career opportunity
you dont have to tell me that
this would not be the place
to begin a career
hey just promise me i wont see you
on the letterman show okay
okay
hey im worried about you
i dont want to see anything happen to you
okay you gonna come to the show
yeah id love to
this sundays hymn is inspired
by the lesson of mary magdalene
now mary magdalene
was a young lady with a past
oh yes
and she was no stranger to sin
she was no stranger
to practically anybody
many condemned her
the whole neighbourhood in fact
but one man refused to do so
one man said
hey now hold on wait a minute
listen to the girls story
hail girls
hail mary whats up
well jerusalems become a real drag
everybody hates me
not that guy over there
who him they all say hes different
they say hes really weird
we dont care what people say
to us hes always there
really
lets take it home ladies
give them some of
that deep shoulder action
ladies ladies you were fantastic
sisters you did good
oh im so excited
i cant wait till sunday when we sing
id rather sing than do anything
its better than ice cream
its better than springtime
its better than sex
no ive heard you know
sisters youre truly an inspiration
and ive asked you here because
i bear remarkable news
now try to remain calm
what im about to say
is nothing short of a miracle
well i didnt believe it myself at first
monsignor for goodness sake
what is it
oh im sorry sister its just that its so
momentous im still adjusting to the shock
the pope the pope himself has heard
of our choir here at saint katherines
and when he visits san francisco
next weekend
despite his inordinately busy schedule
hes requested a special concert here
on sunday night
no no
oh im dying im dying
oh sisters
oh sisters this is indeed glorious news
oh monsignor
were both humbled and honoured
and on such a supremely
solemn occasion
i do feel a traditional program
would be best
you mean traditional like the old way
were speaking of his holiness
mary clarence
not a neighbourhood block party
the pontiff commands
the utmost respect and humility
your more secular entertainments
would be totally out of place
but reverend mother
everyone loves our new style
its brought people back to the church
and thats why hes coming because
were doing something new and different
well i feel this can be settled
by a simple vote
a vote
of course mary clarence
a convent is not a police state
im sure the sisters
are more than capable
of reaching a mature
and dignified consensus
right now all those in favour
of performing a program
of timehonoured sacred music
a truly spiritual repertoire
raise your hands
all those in favour of allowing
mary clarence
to select a more worldly program
however inappropriate raise your hands
the majority has spoken
reverend mother as always youre a true
leader gracious and understanding
its gonna be wonderful reverend mother
youll see
im sure the presentation
will be a great success
congratulations mary clarence
and congratulations to you all
his holiness
now weve got to get busy
come in
you sent for me
you have a phone call
from who
lieutenant souther
hello

to monsignor ohara privately
ive asked to be relocated

but why
i must go where i can be of use
but theres still
so much to be done here
look if its about me
im gonna be gone
indeed and after how long
a few weeks
i have been here for years
well too long i suppose
ive become somewhat obsolete
but you dont have to continue
being obsolete
look everything thats happening here
is a good thing
sister you can still be part of it
part of what
mary clarence it is one thing
to rabblerouse
to sweep into town
and declare a holiday
youve raised the sisters expectations
youve excited and confused them
they imagine this neighbourhood to be
some sort of delightful ongoing bake sale
now you and i know things
are not so simple
therell be disappointments
and rude shocks
and you will have vanished
how fortunate
look i just got things going
you are a formidable woman
you could keep this going

even if i wanted to no
i fear i am a relic
and i have misplaced my tambourine

yes two men and they had guns
why would anyone kidnap a nun
were they catholics
she isnt a nun shes a lounge singer
her real name is deloris van cartier
she witnessed a vicious crime
and has been hiding in our convent
she isnt a nun
she lied to us
but she was such a wonderful nun
look what she did with the choir
she made us sing beautifully
that should have tipped us
well i dont care who she is
we cant sing without her
shes our inspiration
reverend mother please i know that you
and mary clarence didnt always agree
but weve gotta help her please
we must save her
we cant leave it up to the feds
calm down calm down mary robert

theyre taking her to the moonlite lounge
reno nevada
mary emmanuel
tell the monsignor the situation
yes mother
the rest of you follow me
its 1 500 for the run to reno
thats 500 less than i normally charge
but we dont have 1 500
well then i cant fly you there
im sorry
look im sorry ive got some things
i have to check out here
father do not blame this young pilot
for abandoning us in our hour of need
when he stands before you on the day of
judgement do not send straight him to hell
please do not treat him with
the same disregard that hes treated us
just because he cant show
charity to nuns
try not to leave him without rewards
when he asks for them
we know it is easier
to answer the prayers
of a man who has answered
the prayers of others
but if he should come to you
for relief of pain
such as rheumatoid arthritis
loss of hair neck polyps
dont leave him bald
and yowling in despair
watch over him
as he refuses to watch over us
if you cannot we know that you
will have done your best
what goes around comes around
sisters sisters
