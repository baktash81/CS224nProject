i mean  he just shot him in the chair 
just boom  he blew this guy away 
sorry i m late  i m lieutenant souther 
eddie souther 
how do you do 
i m deloris van cartier 
listen  this guy was a simple limo driver 
right  he was a limo driver 
so maybe he made a couple wrong turns
in his life  that s no reason to kill him 
i ve never seen anybody killed before 
sometimes you pass on the freeway 
you see a couple of people dead  
ms  van cartier 
you re vince larocca s girlfriend  right 
well  you could sort of  
maybe  it depends how you look at it 
the guy just tried to kill me  so
i don t think that cements our relationship 
well  you realise
he s a major underworld figure  don t you 
he s into drug dealing 
money laundering 
we ve been investigating mr  larocca
for the last 18 months 
we ve got video tapes 
we ve got surveillance photos 
am i in any of those videos 
no  no  no  criminal activity 
the tapes aren t enough to convict him 
apparently there s a lot
you don t know about vince 
i mean  the last two people that saw him
in action kind of disappeared 
what do you mean 
 kind of disappeared  
well  we found a piece here
and a piece there 
but don t you worry 
here  have a cup of coffee 
you re safe now and we re gonna see
that you stay that way  that s our job 
if you help us  we can help you 
if you testify against vince
about what you saw 
we can put him away
for the rest of his life 
are you crazy  you re telling me this guy s
a mad criminal and you want me to testify 
do you know what s gonna happen 
  he ll track me down and kill me 
  can i call you deloris 
call me anything
as long as you keep me alive 
we wouldn t put you at risk
if we couldn t protect you 
  right 
  it ll only take a couple of months
to get a court date 
just a couple of months 
only a couple   
why not a year 
how about a couple of decades 
two months  we hide you out 
then you testify 
no  no  no 
it s just for a little while 
then you can come back 
really  what are you gonna do 
are you gonna stick me in a bag
and bury me  forget it 
if you testify 
i m gonna put you in the last place on earth
that vince would ever look for you 
  nice church  huh 
  yeah  it s very nice 
look  what am i gonna be 
quasimodo in the bat belfry  what is this 
  i want you to stay here for a while 
  where 
in the convent 
it s the safest place in the world 
you think vince is gonna look for you
in a convent 
  in the what 
  the convent 
you must be out your   i m gonna go back
and work this out with vince 
you re a lunatic  put me in a damn
convent with these people 
these people don t even have sex 
deloris  vince has a contract
out on you for 1 00 grand 
you ve seen what he can do 
that one bullet  that s all it s gonna take 
look  let me explain something to you 
vince knows people all over the place 
you realise that 
  he ll be looking for me everywhere 
  everywhere but this convent 
  oh  come on 
  nobody knows you re here but me 
we re trying to get you a quick court date 
one month  two months tops 
i promise i m gonna spring you
as fast as i can 
what am i gonna do here 
i m gonna go crazy here 
there s nothing here but a lot
of white women dressed as nuns 
what am i gonna do here 
pray 
pray 
yes  but  monsignor 
we are a small convent 
surely there are more
appropriate places 
we can save this young woman s life
and imprison a parasite  all in one gesture 
my heart goes out to her  of course 
my concern would be
she might subject the convent to danger 
the reno police department assures me
you ll be protected from any harm 
they ve promised
to make a generous financial donation 
and as you know 
your small convent is in danger of closing 
well  if they can afford
to be so generous  so can we 
excuse me 
absolutely not  i couldn t possibly 
think of it this way  reverend mother 
she s an ideal prospect for rehabilitation 
that is not a person you can hide 
that is a conspicuous person
designed to stick out 
you have taken a vow of hospitality
to all in need 
i lied 
lieutenant souther 
everything is in order 
no  no  no  everything is not in order 
this woman does not like me 
deloris  these are holy people 
they like everybody 
  this woman doesn t like me 
  one month  two months  tops 
no  forget it  i m not staying here 
  behave yourself 
  i m not gonna stay here 
what is your name 
deloris van cartier 
is that your real name 
yes  i happen to be a singer 
  do sit down 
  thank you 
look  before we get started 
i just want to say that i really appreciate
what you re doing for me 
i know it must be
a huge inconvenience for you 
yeah  so i just wanted
to say thank you upfront 
i also have always  
and i ve said this to people 
i ve always admired you people 
nuns  i mean  you know 
you re so catholic  you know 
i mean  look  you re married to the big jc 
i mean  you re his old lady  you know 
it s an amazing thing to me 
i mean  of course you must be saying 
 well  it s much better than being
hooked up with some kind of two timing   
please  do not smoke in here 
oh  sorry  sorry  you know 
i get so nervous  i get worked up 
i just have   i don t know  i m sorry 
look  ms  van cartier  we have agreed
to conceal and protect you 
which we will do
to the best of our ability 
however it is essential
that you understand
that you are not in a sorority
or a speakeasy 
this is a convent  a religious order 
and there are certain rules
you must obey 
saint katherine s is a place
to commune and to pray 
and i will not tolerate any disruption
whatsoever with that communion 
do you understand 
  yes 
  good 
but do you understand
i m the victim here 
do you understand i m the good guy 
i mean  they just kind of threw me
in here with you nuns 
i mean  do you get that 
i m the good guy 
i mean 
i saw a guy get his face blown off 
so why don t you just give me the key
to my room  i ll lay low 
you stay out of my face 
i ll stay out of your face 
and i will commune my little black ass
in that room 
can you handle that 
  i think it s a very good idea 
  thank you 
well  it s almost lunchtime 
perhaps you d like to freshen up 
and you ll certainly want to change 
hope you don t think
i ll wear what i wore in catholic school 
no  siree 
no ugly green jumpers for me 
and those stupid clunky shoes 
oh  this gold thing 
could you have it dry cleaned for me 
open the cabinet to your left 
you will find suitable attire 
oh  cool 
oh  no  no  no  no 
i can t do this  i m sorry 
this is fine for covering a little bulge 
but now i ve got holster hips 
people wish to kill you 
anyone who s met you  i imagine 
a disguise is necessary
to protect us all 
while you are here 
you will conduct yourself as a nun 
only i will know
who and what you truly are 
you will draw no attention
to yourself whatsoever 
but look at me  i m a nun 
i m a penguin 
as from now and until you leave 
you are sister mary clarence 
mary clarence like clarence williams iii
from the mod squad 
mary is in deference to our holy mother 
the clarence is in honour
of saint clarence of concordia 
there are three vows
every nun must accept 
the vow of poverty  the vow of obedience 
and the vow of chastity 
i am out of here with that 
oh  man 
good afternoon  sisters 
i apologise for my tardiness 
i would like you to welcome a new member
to our house  sister mary clarence 
mary clarence comes to us
from a somewhat progressive convent 
however she s eager
to embrace a more disciplined life
and i am sure will make every effort
to conform to our ways 
i ll do my best 
  would you like to be seated 
  thank you 
yes  mary patrick 
reverend mother  on behalf of
all of the sisters here at saint katherine s 
i d like to offer a great  big  hi there
and hello  to sister mary clarence  hi 
and as part of the welcome 
i thought that maybe our new sister
could offer today s blessing 
that is very thoughtful of you 
mary patrick  but i really  
oh  yeah  yeah  i could do that  sure 
bless us  o lord  for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive 
and  yea  though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of no food 
i will fear no hunger 
we want you to give us this day
our daily bread
and to the republic for which it stands
and by the power invested in me 
i pronounce us ready to eat  amen 
amen 
be seated 
thank you 
what are you people 
this stuff is terrible  it tastes like sh  
sisters  we shall spend
the rest of the day in silence 
why 
only when our lips are silent
may our prayers truly be answered 
then you don t have to eat this food 
silence begins now
and ends at sundown 
how can you eat this stuff  it s terrible 
mary clarence 
i think you might enjoy a ritual fast 
a ritual fa   
no  no  no  i don t think i would 
i ll just put a little salt on it  it ll be fine 
look  pass me the salt over there 
a fast  to remind you of those
who must endure without food 
no  i don t want you to take my plate 
and silence 
how can you let them grill me
for six hours 
i can t control
how long they question you 
  did you go to law school 
  yes  i went to law school 
  did you graduate 
  i m a lawyer  of course i graduated

where s the rest of the furniture 
our lives are simple  we have little need
for material possessions 
this is out of the stone age 
where s the phone 
who would you call 
i don t know  satan 
your cell is more than adequate 
fine  what do we do now 
pray  what 
it s 9 00  pleasant dreams 
wait  are you telling me

if i were you  i would use this time
to think about my life and its direction 
or lack thereof 
there s nothing wrong with my life 
before i came here 
i had a career  i had friends 
i had clothing that fit 
before i came here  i was okay 
oh  really 
from what i ve heard  your singing career
was almost nonexistent 
and your married lover wants you dead 
if you re fooling anyone 
it is only yourself 
god has brought you here

20 minutes ago  scram 
come on  the sun is shining 
it s a beautiful day 
we are a small congregation
this morning 
too many mornings 
something has gone terribly wrong 
where is faith  where is celebration 
where is everyone 
still  rather than regret
the absence of our neighbours 
let us rejoice in the fellowship
of those present 
our choir mistress 
sister mary lazarus 
has informed me that our choir 
while always superior 
has been toiling especially hard
on this week s selection 
sister

don t you worry  you ll get the hang of it 
i ll help you 
thank you 
are you always this cheerful 
am i 
all right  i am  i know it 
i can t help it  i ve always been upbeat 
optimistic  perky 
even as a child  my mother used to say 
 that girl is pure sunshine 
she ll either grow up to be a nun
or a stewardess  
coffee 
  enough about me  what about you 
  yes  what convent did you come from 
i came from the convent
of the sisters of the moonlite in reno 
oh  i love reno 
  you do 
  yes 
well  you would have loved us 
we were a kind of pioneering order 
you know  we d never wear any kind of
habit this tight  though  this is really tight 
oh  i must say  our habits
do cut you at the neck just a bit 
hear  hear 
that s enough jabber 
vanity  a progressive convent 
sounds awful 
i liked my convent in vancouver 
out in the woods  wasn t all modern
like some of these newfangled convents 
we didn t have electricity 
cold water  bare feet  those were nuns 
sounds wonderful 
it was hell on earth  i loved it 
this place is a hilton 
sister mary clarence 
when did you get your call 
what call 
oh  the call  the call 
i didn t know which call you meant 
i was working in reno
when i got the call 
and you don t know how hard it is
to get a call until you ve worked in reno 
we ministered to
a lot of different kinds of people 
newlyweds  hookers  gamblers 
what a joy  how fulfilling to be able
to get right in there with your hands
and work with the people 
  and reno  it s probably bursting with sin 
  it was  that s why i had to leave 
i mean  we had a hooker living next door
called buckwheat bertha who would  
sister mary clarence 
could i have a word with you 
  who  me 
  yes  you 
yeah  excuse me 
get on with your work 
  quickly  please 
  i was just talking to them 
precisely  enough chatter  chores 
yeah  i need to talk to eddie souther 
yeah  it s an emergency 
  souther 
  eddie  eddie  eddie 
you gotta get me out of here 
deloris  you can t call me here 
somebody s gonna catch on
to where you are 
but i m going insane here 
all these people do is work and pray 
work and pray  that s all they do 
calm down  look  i didn t want to
tell you this  we got some problems here 
what kind of problems 
what do you mean  problems 
keeping our witnesses alive 
there s a leak in the department
and some of them end up dead

  just sit tight 
you don t seem to understand
what i m saying 
i am in a nightmare  this is my nightmare 
it s a nightmare  man  get me out of here 
i mean it  don t call me

i could never seem to get up on time 
i set it for 5 
out of bed  you daisy head 
out of bed  you daisy head

from your convent
that even someone like you
could get lonely 
have a seat 
  so which one are you 
  mary robert 
you have a little trouble getting up
at 5 00 too  mary robert 
oh  not now  i get up a half an hour early
just to make sure 
it s not just the mornings 
it s that  all my life 
everybody seems to be doing
or catching on to things
a second faster or better than me 
yeah  well  everybody s
playing catch up nowadays 
so  mary robert 
did you always want to be a nun 
i always knew that was my calling 
to lead a life of service  but  you see 
i ve always felt that there s something
inside me that i want to give 
something that s only me
and nobody else 
does that sound like a terrible thing 
like pride 
no  doesn t sound
like a terrible thing at all 
i m so happy that you ve come
to join us  mary clarence 
you know how sometimes it s as if
you have to be yourself or you ll just burst 
yep  i do

stop the giggling  let s go 
the sisters have made clear to me
that they followed you of their own volition 
but they would never have ventured out
at all at night
had it not been for your example 
listen  they just don t want to be stuck
behind these walls all the time 
these walls are the only
protection they have 
the streets are no longer safe for them 
and they are certainly not safe for you 
these robes no longer protect our sisters 
the walls do 
i m sorry 
you really do care about them 
don t you 
yes  i do 
and i care about you and your life 
i shall ask monsignor o hara
and lieutenant souther
to find a safer and more suitable
situation for you 
oh  no  come on 
don t send me away  really 
i m just starting to get the hang of this 
i mean  look  i m not gonna endanger
anyone or anything else  i swear 
what about forgiveness 
lsn t that what you preach 
there s gotta be something around here
that i can do
that s not gonna chip my nails
or annoy anybody 
you re right  mary clarence 
to err is human  to forgive divine 
you may stay 
but i shall restrict your activities
to a single task 
what s that 
singing  you will join the choir 
choir  no 
you will sleep and you will sing

  sort of freelance 
  freelance  really 
you don t think i see  you think i took
vows yesterday  i know what you re up to 
  you and reverend mother 
  what 
you re a ringer  she brought you here
to replace me  out with the old 
oh  could you help us  mary clarence 
mary lazarus  you re terrific 
but we could really use some help 
  please  you ve heard us 
  we re terrible 
please  would you do something for us 
please 
well  there s a word for this  mutiny 
so  mary clarence 
you think you can do better 
i believe i d like to see that 
go ahead  sister  make them sing 
okay 
where are the basses 
oh  you should be over here 
and the altos  where are you 
sister  why don t you join them 
and  sopranos  where are you

okay  okay  okay 
very  very nice 
sister  would you come
over here  please 
just slide right in here for me  please 
right here 
  that s a powerful instrument you have 
  thank you 
but i think it s probably a good idea
if we bring you down out of the rafters 
i mean  everybody wants
to be close to god 
i m just not sure you can do it vocally 
okay  so i need you to sing an octave
below where you ve been singing 
okey dokey 
and sister mary robert 
could you come stand over here  please 
yeah  come on over 
i noticed that you re moving your mouth 
but nothing s coming out

if you don t mind 
sister alma 
could you give me an a  please 
alma 
check your battery 
give me an a  please 
okay  wait 
try this  close your eyes 
visualise yourself
in a room full of people 
lots of silverware  people dropping stuff 
talking loud  drunks 
women with trays going 
 what are you gonna have  
your voice has to carry over the din 
you have to get up over all of that
to be heard in the back of the room
where i m sitting  listening 
straining to hear you  okay 
keep that in your mind when we do this 
sister 
we call that an a with an attitude 
that s what you need 
you have to put attitude in what you sing 
have to think
about what you re singing 
it s not just quacking  this is rejoicing 
you are singing to the lord 
let s review those notes again
and see if we can put it together  sister 
basses  altos  sopranos 
on three  one  two  three 
oh  we did it 
we actually sang a chord 
that was exciting 
yeah  you sang a chord
for two seconds 
the next thing you have to learn how to do
is listen to each other 
that s a big key  big key 
you must listen to each other
if you re going to be a group 
i knew that 
mary lazarus  as soon as i walked
in the door  i knew that you knew this 
now  you re somebody who s
into hard work and discipline  aren t you 
  of course  i m a nun  four popes now 
  four 
  how often do they rehearse 
  twice a week  couple hours 
not enough  i mean  listen to them 
they really need a lot of work 
they gotta rehearse every day 
she s good 
well  do you think
they really could get better 
  i don t know  they re pretty raw 
  wet behind the ears 
oh  please  let us try 
  this is gonna be hell 
  tell me about it 
welcome this sunday morning 
oh  ye few but faithful 
the choir  i m told  has elected
a new director  sister mary clarence 
who will lead them
in  hail  holy queen  
  what do you think s going on up there 
  i don t know  man 
hallelujah 
girl groups  boogie woogie on the piano 
what were you thinking 
i was thinking more like vegas 
you know  get some butts in the seats 
and what next  popcorn  curtain calls 
this is not a theatre or a casino 
yeah  but that s the problem 
see  people like going to theatres
and they like going to casinos 
but they don t like coming to church  why 
because it s a drag 
but we can change all that 
see  we could pack this joint 
through blasphemy 
you have corrupted the entire choir 
excuse me  excuse me  excuse me 
how can you say that 
i worked my butt off with these women 
they ve given up their free time to do this
and they re good 
i mean  sister  we could rock this place 
out of the question 
as of tomorrow  mary lazarus
resumes her leadership of the choir 
come in 
reverend mother 
i just wanted to congratulate you 
i haven t enjoyed mass this much in years 
what a marvellous program 
innovative  inspiring 
you re to be commended 
i can t wait till next sunday
when the choir performs again 
did you see the people
walk in off the street 
that music  that heavenly music 
reverend mother  it called to them 
it did 
i must tell the archbishop 
i ll send him a personal letter
describing your efforts 
your bold new fight
to keep your little convent alive 
and you must also include this  this is
something she would never tell you herself 
because this is the kind
of woman she is 
sisters  she wants us to go out into
the neighbourhood and meet the people 
  oh  this woman 
  oh  bless her 
there are so many problems out there
that we could maybe help with 
i mean 
that s why many of us became nuns 
oh  it s really marvellous 
reverend mother 
there s a lot we could do for them
besides pray  sister 
you re a pioneer 
monsignor  surely you realise
how dangerous this neighbourhood is 
and you will face that danger head on 
  as if i could stop you 
  you couldn t 
you have my complete support
in this matter 
anything you can do to revitalise
this neighbourhood would be a blessing 
don t you just love her 
yes 
yes  the failing convent at
saint katherine s has truly come alive
thanks to the efforts of its popular choir 
what an amazing turnaround story 
this convent was once alienated
from its surrounding neighbours 
  now  as you can see  its doors are open   
  vinny  get over here 
  establishing facilities like a daycare
centre and a food kitchen for the homeless 
  as a matter of fact   
  vin  you gotta see these cute nuns 
i m shooting pool 
babe  we should send them money 
they re do gooders 
  attribute this reach out philosophy
to a new addition to the convent
sister mary clarence 
who  unfortunately  is a little camera shy 
i m gonna kill her 
i m gonna kill her myself 
in related news  the pope visits the u s 
and we ll have more on that in a moment 
  good morning 
  thank you so much 
  good morning  monsignor 
  good morning 
  good to see you 
  good morning 
hey  hey  you looking for me 
what you doing here 
  how come i saw you on tv 
  that was not my fault 
these people just showed up 
but it s been really good for the convent 
you re supposed to be hiding out 
remember 
bullets flying through the air at you 
  ring a bell 
  yes 
but i can t talk about it now 
i have a show in five minutes 
listen to yourself 
this is not a career opportunity 
you don t have to tell me that 
this would not be the place
to begin a career 
hey  just promise me i won t see you
on the letterman show  okay 
okay 
hey  i m worried about you 
i don t want to see anything happen to you 
okay  you gonna come to the show 
yeah  i d love to 
this sunday s hymn is inspired
by the lesson of mary magdalene 
now  mary magdalene
was a young lady with a past 
oh  yes 
and she was no stranger to sin 
she was no stranger
to practically anybody 
many condemned her 
the whole neighbourhood  in fact 
but one man refused to do so 
one man said 
 hey  now  hold on  wait a minute 
listen to the girl s story  
  hail  girls 
  hail  mary  what s up 
well  jerusalem s become a real drag 
everybody hates me 
not that guy over there 
who  him  they all say he s different 
they say he s really weird 
we don t care what people say 
to us  he s always there 
really 
let s take it home  ladies 
give them some of
that deep shoulder action 
  ladies  ladies  you were fantastic 
  sisters  you did good 
oh  i m so excited 
i can t wait till sunday when we sing 
  i d rather sing than do anything 
  it s better than ice cream 
  it s better than springtime 
  it s better than sex 
no  i ve heard  you know 
sisters  you re truly an inspiration 
and i ve asked you here because
i bear remarkable news 
now  try to remain calm 
what i m about to say
is nothing short of a miracle 
well  i didn t believe it myself at first 
monsignor  for goodness  sake 
what is it 
oh  i m sorry  sister  it s just that it s so
momentous  i m still adjusting to the shock 
the pope  the pope himself  has heard
of our choir here at saint katherine s 
and when he visits san francisco
next weekend 
despite his inordinately busy schedule 
he s requested a special concert here
on sunday night 
no  no 
oh  i m dying  i m dying 
oh  sisters 
oh  sisters  this is indeed glorious news 
oh  monsignor 
we re both humbled and honoured 
and on such a supremely
solemn occasion 
i do feel a traditional program
would be best 
you mean  traditional like the old way 
we re speaking of his holiness 
mary clarence 
not a neighbourhood block party 
the pontiff commands
the utmost respect and humility 
your more secular entertainments
would be totally out of place 
but  reverend mother 
everyone loves our new style 
it s brought people back to the church 
and that s why he s coming  because
we re doing something new and different 
well  i feel this can be settled
by a simple vote 
  a vote 
  of course  mary clarence 
a convent is not a police state 
i m sure the sisters
are more than capable
of reaching a mature
and dignified consensus 
right  now all those in favour
of performing a program
of time honoured  sacred music 
a truly spiritual repertoire 
raise your hands 
all those in favour of allowing
mary clarence
to select a more worldly program 
however inappropriate  raise your hands 
the majority has spoken 
reverend mother  as always  you re a true
leader  gracious and understanding 
it s gonna be wonderful  reverend mother 
you ll see 
i m sure the presentation
will be a great success 
congratulations  mary clarence 
and congratulations to you all 
his holiness 
now  we ve got to get busy 
come in 
you sent for me 
  you have a phone call 
  from who 
lieutenant souther 
hello 
hey  deloris  great news 
i pulled some strings 
the judge agreed to move up the trial 
we ll be in court in a couple days 
really  that soon 
in 48 hours  you re a free woman 
oh  that s great 
yeah  that s great 
hey  well  don t thank me or anything 
no  it is  no  thank you 
i m sorry  i m sorry  thank you 
yeah  all right  bye 
well  seems like your prayers
have been answered 
gonna be out of here in a week 
i m leaving 
  you re leaving 
  yeah 
  that makes two of us 
  what do you mean 
i have submitted my resignation
to monsignor o hara  privately 
i ve asked to be relocated
as soon as possible 
but why 
i must go where i can be of use 
but there s still
so much to be done here 
look  if it s about me 
i m gonna be gone 
indeed  and after how long 
a few weeks 
i have been here for years 
well  too long  i suppose 
i ve become somewhat obsolete 
but you don t have to continue
being obsolete 
look  everything that s happening here
is a good thing 
  sister  you can still be part of it 
  part of what 
mary clarence  it is one thing
to rabble rouse 
to sweep into town
and declare a holiday 
you ve raised the sisters  expectations 
you ve excited and confused them 
they imagine this neighbourhood to be
some sort of delightful ongoing bake sale 
now  you and i know things
are not so simple 
there ll be disappointments
and rude shocks 
and you will have vanished 
how fortunate 
look  i just got things going 
you are a formidable woman 
you could keep this going 
could i 
even if i wanted to  no 
i fear i am a relic 
and i have misplaced my tambourine 
  good day  mary clarence 
  but  sister  
good day 
don t peek 
don t peek  ready 
crazy women  what have you done 
what is this 
  it s ice cream 
  i know that  but  
well  it s a great big cuddly bear hug
of a thank you from us to you 
not thank you to me  thank you to you 
i mean  when did you do this 
this is a sin  it s a wicked indulgence 
didn t they have any butter pecan 
  hope reverend mother doesn t catch us

mary clarence  this morning in prayers 
i thanked god for bringing you to us

yeah  anything is possible

where are we going 
your sister here s
got a special command performance 
yeah  back at the moonlite lounge 
look  why don t you just let her go

  the moonlite lounge 
  come on  get out of the street

  yes  two men  and they had guns 
why would anyone kidnap a nun 
were they catholics 
she isn t a nun  she s a lounge singer 
her real name is deloris van cartier 
she witnessed a vicious crime
and has been hiding in our convent 
  she isn t a nun 
  she lied to us 
  but she was such a wonderful nun 
  look what she did with the choir 
  she made us sing beautifully 
  that should have tipped us 
well  i don t care who she is 
we can t sing without her 
she s our inspiration 
reverend mother  please  i know that you
and mary clarence didn t always agree 
  but we ve gotta help her  please 
  we must save her 
we can t leave it up to the feds 
calm down  calm down  mary robert 
think clearly  have you any idea
who these two men were 
yes  they were from reno and
they re taking her to the moonlite lounge 
reno  nevada 
mary emmanuel 
tell the monsignor the situation 
  yes  mother 
  the rest of you  follow me 
it s 1  500 for the run to reno 
that s 500 less than i normally charge 
but we don t have  1  500 
well  then i can t fly you there 
i m sorry 
look  i m sorry  i ve got some things
i have to check out here 
father  do not blame this young pilot
for abandoning us in our hour of need 
when he stands before you on the day of
judgement  do not send straight him to hell 
please  do not treat him with
the same disregard that he s treated us 
just because he can t show
charity to nuns 
try not to leave him without rewards
when he asks for them 
we know it is easier
to answer the prayers
of a man who has answered
the prayers of others 
but if he should come to you
for relief of pain  
such as rheumatoid arthritis 
loss of hair  neck polyps 
don t leave him bald
and yowling in despair 
watch over him
as he refuses to watch over us 
if you cannot  we know that you
will have done your best 
  what goes around comes around 
  sisters  sisters 
hold on a second 
what did you think you were doing
running to the cops  deloris  hiding out

  vince  we can t waste a nun 
what are you nuts talking about 
it s deloris in a costume 
well  vince  how do you know
she didn t join up
