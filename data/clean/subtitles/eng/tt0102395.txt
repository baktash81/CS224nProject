we have orders to arrest your peasant girl 
over my dead body 
do not draw that sword
unless you intend to use it  sir

we re mere soldiers
working on the queen s business

brilliant  simply brilliant  frozen forever 
that little curse was nothing  my queenie

mother  i have never
asked you for anything 
but i beseech you 
take my life and spare hers 
all right  since you re such a romantic 
a thousand years 
or until she meets a true love
from another land 
only then can the cursed necklace
be removed 
no 
is it a deal 
yes  but you have cursed your kingdom
for 1 000 years 
and that is the legend
of hauptmann koenig s
enchanted peasant girl

of course  nobody really believes it 
now  if you ll come this way 
i ll show you our hall of galoshes 
looking in your eyes
i see a paradise
this world that i ve found
is too good to be true
standing here beside you
want so much to give you
this love in my heart
that i m feeling for you
let  em say we re crazy
i don t care about that
put your hand in my hand  baby
don t ever look back
let the world around us just fall apart
baby  we can make it
if we re heart to heart
and we can build this dream together
standing strong forever
nothing s gonna stop us now
and if this world runs out of lovers
we ll still have each other
nothing s gonna stop us
nothing s gonna stop us now
i m so glad i found you
i m not gonna lose you
whatever it takes
i will stay here with you
take it to the good times
see it through the bad times
whatever it takes is what i m gonna do
let  em say we re crazy
what do they know
put your arms around me  baby
don t ever let go
let the world around us just fall apart
baby  we can make it
if we re heart to heart
and we can build this dream together
standing strong forever
nothing s gonna stop us now
and if this world runs out of lovers
we ll still have each other
nothing s gonna stop us
nothing s gonna stop us now
i m so glad i found you
i m not gonna lose you
whatever it takes
i will stay here with you
take it to the good times
see it through the bad times
whatever it takes
is what i m gonna do
let  em say we re crazy
what do they know
put your arms around me  baby
don t ever let go
let the world around us just fall apart
baby  we can make it
if we re heart to heart
and we can build this dream together
standing strong forever
nothing s gonna stop us now
and if this world runs out of lovers
we ll still have each other
nothing s gonna stop us
nothing s gonna stop us
ooh  all that i need is you
all that i ever need
and all that i want to do
