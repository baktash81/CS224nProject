  you gonna squirt us with a hose again 
  that s up to you 
  i gotta feed my turtle 
  the damn turtle stole my headband 
joey  come on  time to get up 
i don t want to 
the teacher s a big fat tub 
proffitt boys  come up here 
miss pitcannon tells me
you don t wanna take these tests 
i m itchin  and i wanna go home 
you may go stand in the corner
until you can talk like a little boy 
all of you children
are new in this school 
these scores will determine
your placement in future classes 
you must concentrate   
  greg  stop that 
  make a face 
  i m in real bad shape 
  nonsense 
now  if you concentrate  i m sure
you can control those little bodies 
i see that  amanda 
joey  sit 
  is anyone at your home 
  yeah  our mom is 
you have a mother now 
your father remarried 
yeah  we got a new mother now 
well  good 
then i m calling both your parents 
mrs  burbridge  i m annie proffitt 
what happened 
well  mrs  proffitt  apparently
your children consider themselves
above taking
the schwartzman heinliken tests 
i m sorry  what are
the schwartzman heinliken tests 
placement tests  they are very valuable
in measuring intelligence and potential 
sit still 
your children are a discipline problem 
i know  i have had difficulties myself 
  what did you do now 
  they decided to play sick 
and not very convincingly 
now  i believe their problems exist
because of deficient parental guidance 
the children are slovenly  incorrigible
and being reared by a father
who clearly isn t concerned
about their welfare 
but is himself just a large child 
  excuse me  mrs  burbridge 
  the test results  thank you 
i ll look these over as soon
as i m finished with this    woman 
oh  my god 
i ll see you later in the cafeteria 
mrs  burbridge 
would you come over here for a moment 
has it escaped your attention that these
children have head to toe poison oak 
well  no    yes  but   
but what  my children are
in need of medical assistance 
and you can sit here and smugly
lecture me on the importance of tests 
tests which label children s potential 
a thing which cannot be measured 
least of all by anal compulsive huns 
and my husband may be a large child 
but that s none of your business 
and my children may be rotten 
but they re mine 
and i think that they re
bright and sensitive 
so i have no doubts whatsoever
about their intelligence 
i do  however 
have serious doubts about yours 
kids  get in the car  let s go 
move 
  she told her off 
  dad never did that 
discipline problem 
my regards to schwartzman and heinliken 
i can t stop itching 
well  what do you expect
when you roll around in poison oak 
what i want you to do  what the doctor
said  is put it right on the red parts 
ok 
soon we re going to clean up
this room because it s a disgrace 
  we like it like a disgrace 
  dad lets us do whatever we want 
yeah  well  it s trickling
down the stairway 
joey  don t  don t get that near your
eyes  look  i want you to read this 
see what it says 
 don t get near your eyes   read on 
  what s this all about 
  he s embarrassed  cause he can t read 
  well  he s a small child 
  he can t read
  for a small child either 
  the teacher makes fun of him 
ok  we ll talk about this later 
go to sleep 
  dean 
  where is that 
  dean 
  yeah 
  what is it 
  where are you going 
out  if i could ever find my   
oh  wait  wait 
not tonight  we have to talk 
  when i get home  i m in a hurry 
  now 
you know  i let the water routine
slide by the other day 
but let s not push it  ok 
i got a little carried away with
the hose  but this is important 
ok  fine  what s on your mind 
sugarlips 
stop calling me sugarlips 
i have a name  call me annie 
get to the point  annie  i m busy 
the guys are waitin  for me 
you can t run out every time things get
complicated here  the kids are sick 
they got calamine lotion 
what do you want me to do 
take on some grown up responsibility 
i earn the money 
that s a responsibility 
are you aware that joey can t read 
that travis only reads smut magazines 
i can t get him out of the bathroom 
he s 13 
i ll build you another bathroom 
they don t need that 
they need guidance from you 
now  don t you worry about me
and my boys  ok  we re pals 
they have enough pals 
they need a father 
hey  hey  hey  look  i decided
a long time before you    you and me   
we decided a long time ago 
before we started this family 
we d raise these kids naturally 
not force bullshit rules   
i m not talking about discipline 
i m talking   
stuff you shouldn t be talking about 
it s none of your business  anyway 
  my children are none of my business

  happy birthday  annie 
  thanks  dean 
i ve never tasted
anything quite like this 
it s good stuff 
boy  it sure is pretty  isn t it 
why do they honk three times 
to signal they re comin  home 
yeah  it s a legend    of arturo 
who was a portuguese fisherman 
he met this beautiful girl
his first night in town  catarina 
and eventually they fell in love 
but the problem was that catarina s
father was the territorial governor 
he didn t want his only little girl
to be with a lowly fisherman 
so he told arturo
that he d have to ship off 
which he did  but he told catarina
he d be back for her 
and when he came back 
he d signal with three long blasts
so she could dive off the rocks and swim
to the boat  and they d be on their way 
oh  i love this story 
so  a year later 
everything went as planned 
but when she
was swimmin  out to the boat 
the fog got so thick that
she couldn t find the boat 
arturo panicked
and he called out   catarina  catarina  
catarina yelled back   arturo  
with that  he dove right off the boat
into the icy waters  and they   
  kissed 
  no  they drowned 
they never found each other
and they drowned 
  oh  that s a terrible story 
  yeah  but the legend is
they reunited at the bottom of the sea 
right over there 
and every time you see
the spray goin  up  it s them 
  making love 
  yeah 
for ever and ever 
for i can t help
falling in love   
dean
