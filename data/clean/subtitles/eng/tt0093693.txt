yeah our mom is
you have a mother now
your father remarried
yeah we got a new mother now
well good
then im calling both your parents
mrs burbridge im annie proffitt
what happened
well mrs proffitt apparently
your children consider themselves
above taking
the schwartzmanheinliken tests
im sorry what are
the schwartzmanheinliken tests
placement tests they are very valuable
in measuring intelligence and potential
sit still
your children are a discipline problem
i know i have had difficulties myself
what did you do now
they decided to play sick
and not very convincingly
now i believe their problems exist
because of deficient parental guidance
the children are slovenly incorrigible
and being reared by a father
who clearly isnt concerned
about their welfare
but is himself just a large child
excuse me mrs burbridge
the test results thank you
ill look these over as soon
as im finished with this woman
oh my god
ill see you later in the cafeteria
mrs burbridge
would you come over here for a moment
has it escaped your attention that these
children have headtotoe poison oak
well no yes but
but what my children are
in need of medical assistance
and you can sit here and smugly
lecture me on the importance of tests
tests which label childrens potential
a thing which cannot be measured
least of all by analcompulsive huns
and my husband may be a large child
but thats none of your business
and my children may be rotten
but theyre mine
and i think that theyre
bright and sensitive
so i have no doubts whatsoever
about their intelligence
i do however
have serious doubts about yours

happy birthday annie
thanks dean
ive never tasted
anything quite like this
its good stuff
boy it sure is pretty isnt it
why do they honk three times
to signal theyre comin home
yeah its a legend of arturo
who was a portuguese fisherman
he met this beautiful girl
his first night in town catarina
and eventually they fell in love
but the problem was that catarinas
father was the territorial governor
he didnt want his only little girl
to be with a lowly fisherman
so he told arturo
that hed have to ship off
which he did but he told catarina
hed be back for her
and when he came back
hed signal with three long blasts
so she could dive off the rocks and swim
to the boat and theyd be on their way
oh i love this story
so a year later
everything went as planned
but when she
was swimmin out to the boat
the fog got so thick that
she couldnt find the boat
arturo panicked
and he called out catarina catarina
catarina yelled back arturo
with that he dove right off the boat
into the icy waters and they
kissed
no they drowned
they never found each other
and they drowned
oh thats a terrible story
yeah but the legend is
they reunited at the bottom of the sea
right over there
and every time you see
the spray goin up its them
making love
yeah
for ever and ever
for i cant help
falling in love
dean
