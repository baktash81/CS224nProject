and i also have an arugula caesar salad
for entrees i have swordfish meatloaf
with onion marmalade
rare roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale
and grilled free range rabbit
with herb french fries
our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth
god i hate this place
its a chicks restaurant
why not dorsia
because bateman wont give
the maître d head
is that reed robinson
you freebasing thats not robinson
who is it then
thats paul allen
thats not paul allen
paul allens on the other side of the room
whos he with
some weasel from kicker peabody
cant do coke in this bathroom
are you sure thats paul allen
yes mcdufus
he handles the fisher account
lucky bastard
lucky jew bastard
what does that have to do with anything
ive seen that bastard in his office
on the phone with ceos
spinning a fucking menorah
not a menorah you spin a dreidel
oh my god do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes
some latkes
no just
cool it with the antisemitic remarks
i forgot batemans dating someone
from the aclu
the voice of reason the boy next door
speaking of reasonable
only 570
not bad
two stoli on the rocks
these arent good any more
its a cash bar
that will be 25
youre a fucking ugly bitch
i want to stab you to death
and play around with your blood
i live in the american gardens building
on west 81st street
on the 11th floor
my name is patrick bateman
im 27 years old
i believe in taking care of myself
in a balanced diet
and a rigorous exercise routine
in the morning if my face is a little puffy
lll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches
i can do 1000 now
after i remove the ice pack
i use a deep pore cleanser lotion
in the shower
i use a wateractivated gel cleanser
then a honeyalmond body scrub
and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub
then i apply a herb mint facial mask
which i leave on for 10 minutes
while i prepare the rest of my routine
i always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol
because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older
then moisturiser
then an antiageing eye balm
followed by
a final moisturising protective lotion
there is an idea of a patrick bateman
some kind of abstraction
but there is no real me
only an entity something illusory
and though i can hide my cold gaze
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours
and maybe you can even sense
our lifestyles are probably comparable
i simply am not there
morning hamilton nice tan
late
aerobics class sorry any messages
ricky harrison cancelled he didnt say
what he was cancelling or why
i occasionally box with ricky
at the harvard club anyone else
spencer wants to meet for drinks

just say no

thanks patrick
im not here and high heels
i like high heels
hundreds thousands of roses
and lots of chocolate truffles godiva
and oysters on the half shell
im listening
to the new robert palmer tape
but evelyn my supposed fiancée
keeps buzzing in my ear
photographers
annie leibovitz well get annie leibovitz
and well have to get someone
to videotape it
patrick we should do it
do what
get married
no i cant take the time off work
your father owns the company
you can do anything silly
i dont want to talk about it
you hate that job anyway
i dont see why you just dont quit
because i want to fit in
williams party
im on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at espace
since im positive
we wont have a decent table
but we do
and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave
this is my cousin
vanden and her boyfriend stash
theyre both artists
the menu is in braille
im fairly certain that timothy bryce
and evelyn are having an affair
timothy is the only interesting person
i know
im almost completely indifferent
as to whether evelyn knows
lm having an affair
with courtney rawlinson
her closest friend
courtney is almost perfect looking
she usually operates
on one or more psychiatric drugs
tonight i believe its xanax
more disturbing than her drug use
though
is the fact that shes engaged
to luis carruthers
the biggest dufus in the business
tell me stash
do you think soho is becoming
too commercial
yes i read that
who gives a rats ass
that affects us
what about the massacres
in sri lanka honey
doesnt that affect us too
do you know anything about sri lanka
the sikhs are killing tons of israelis
come on bryce there are a lot more
important problems than sri lanka
to worry about
like what
we have to end apartheid for one
and slow down the nuclear arms race
stop terrorism and world hunger
we have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights
while also promoting equal rights
for women
we have to encourage a return
to traditional moral values
most importantly we have to promote
general social concern
and less materialism in young people
patrick

some caffeine might get you
out of this slump

valentino couture
it looks so soft
your compliment was sufficient luis
hello halberstram nice tie

marcus halberstram
it seems logical because
marcus also works at p  p
and does the same exact thing i do
he also has a penchant for valentino suits
and oliver peoples glasses
we even go to the same barber
although i have a slightly better haircut
so hows the ransom account going

thank you mister thank you
im cold out here
do you know what a fucking loser you are
what beautiful skin you have
mr bateman
so fine so smooth
i have all the characteristics
of a human being
flesh blood skin hair
but not a single clear
identifiable emotion
except for greed and disgust
something horrible is happening
inside of me
and i dont know why
my nightly bloodlust has overflowed
into my days
i feel lethal on the verge of frenzy
i think my mask of sanity is about to slip
hey mccloy what do you say

by the way almost completely empty
im very sorry sir
j  b straight and a corona
would you like to
double absolut martini
yes sir
would you like to hear the specials
not if you want to keep your spleen
this is a real beehive of activity
halberstram
this place is hot very hot
the mud soup and the charcoal arugula
are outrageous here
yeah well youre late
im a child of divorce give me a break
i see theyve omitted the pork loin
with lime jello
we shouldve gone to dorsia
i couldve gotten us a table
nobody goes there anymore
is that lvana trump
jeez patrick i mean marcus
what are you thinking
why would lvana be at texarkana
so wasnt rothschild originally handling
the fisher account
howd you get it
i could tell you that halberstram
but then id have to kill you
i like to dissect girls
did you know im utterly insane
great tan marcus really impressive
where do you tan
salon
ive got a tanning bed at home
you should look into it
and cecelia how is she
where is she tonight
well you know cecelia
i think shes having dinner
with evelyn williams
evelyn
great ass goes out with that loser
patrick bateman what a dork
another martini paul
you like huey lewis  the news
theyre okay
their early work was
a little too new wave for my taste
but when sports came out in 83
i think they really came into their own
commercially and artistically
the whole album has a clear crisp sound
and a new sheen
of consummate professionalism
that really gives the songs a big boost
hes been compared to elvis costello
but i think huey has a far more bitter
cynical sense of humour
hey halberstram
yes allen
why are there copies of the style section
all over the place
do you have a dog
a little chow or something
no allen
is that a raincoat
yes it is
in 1987 huey released this
four their most accomplished album
i think their undisputed masterpiece is
hip to be square
a song so catchy that most people
probably dont listen to the lyrics
but they should because its not just
about the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends its also
a personal statement about the band itself
hey paul
try getting a reservation at dorsia now
you fucking stupid bastard
patrick patrick
is that you
no luis its not me
youre mistaken
this is my very good friend
patrick bateman
where are you going
were going to nells
gwendolyns father is buying it
where did you get that overnight bag
jean paul gaultier
when i get to paul allens place
i use the keys i took from his pocket
before disposing of the body
there is a moment of sheer panic
when i realise that pauls apartment
overlooks the park
and is obviously more expensive
than mine
i calm myself
and move into the bedroom
where i find his suitcase and
start to pack
its time for paul to take a little trip
where to send the bastard
dallas
paris singapore london
ill send the asshole to london
hi this is paul
ive been called to london for a few days
meredith ill call you when i get back
hasta la vista baby
what is it
patrick its just
yes jean
mr donald kimball is here to see you
who
detective donald kimball
tell him im at lunch
patrick its only 1030
i think he knows youre here
send him in i guess
now john youve got to wear clothes
in proportion to your physique
there are definite dos and donts
good buddy of wearing a bold stripe shirt
a bold striped shirt calls for solid coloured
or discreetly patterned suits and ties
yes always tip the stylist 15
listen john ive got to go
t bone pickens just walked in
just joking
no dont tip the owner of the salon
okay john right got it
sorry
no im sorry
i shouldve made an appointment
was that anything important
that just mulling
over business problems
examining opportunities
exchanging rumours
spreading gossip
hi im donald kimball
hi pat bateman nice to meet you
sorry to barge in on you like this
i know how busy you guys can get
so whats the
topic of discussion
ive been hired by meredith powell
to investigate the disappearance
of paul allen
i see pauls disappearance yeah
its nothing that official
i just have some basic questions
about paul and yourself
coffee
no im okay
apollinaris
no im okay
can you bring mr
kimball
a bottle of
no really im okay
its no problem
so whats the topic of discussion
disappearance of paul allen
right well i
i havent heard anything
about the disappearance or anything
not on page six at least
his family wants this kept quiet
understandable
lime
no really im okay
sure i can get you a lime
just some preliminary questions
that i need for my own files okay
shoot
how old are you
27
where did you go to school
harvard the harvard business school
your address
american gardens building
west 81st street
nice very nice
thanks
what can you tell me about paul allen
im at a loss
he was part of that whole yale thing
yale thing
yeah yale thing
what do you mean
well i think for one that
he was probably a closet homosexual
who did a lot of cocaine that yale thing
what kind of a man was he besides
the information youve just given me
i hope im not being crossexamined here
do you feel like that
no not really
where did paul hang out
hang out
yeah you know hang out
let me think
the newport harrys fluties
indochine nells the cornell club
the new york yacht club
he had a yacht
no he just hung out there
and where did he go to school
dont you know this
i just wanted to know if you know
before yale
if i remember correctly saint pauls
listen i just want to help
i understand
any witnesses or fingerprints
theres a message on his answering
machine that says he went to london
maybe he did
his girlfriend doesnt think so
has anyone seen him in london
actually yes
but ive had difficulty getting
an actual verification
a stephen hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there
but i checked it out and what happened is
he mistook a herbert ainsworth for paul
had his apartment been burglarised
no actually it hadnt
toiletries were missing a suit was gone
so was some luggage thats it
anyone dealing with the homicide squad
no not yet as i said were not sure
basically no ones seen or heard anything
so typical isnt it
its just strange
one day someones walking around
going to work
alive and then
nothing
people just disappear
the earth just opens up
and swallows them
eerie really eerie
youll have to excuse me
i have a meeting with cliff huxtable
at the four seasons in 20 minutes
the four seasons
isnt that a little far uptown
arent you going to be late
no theres one down here
really i didnt know that
yes its very good
listen if anything occurs to you
any information
absolutely im 100 with you
great and thanks for your time
mr bateman
byebye
bye
i havent seen you around here
you just havent been looking
would you like to see my apartment
im not supposed to
do you want to come
to my apartment or not
im not supposed to
but i can make an exception
do you take a credit card
im joking come on get in
id like a girl early twenties blonde
who does couples
couples i really cant stress
blonde enough
blonde
im paul my name is paul allen
you got that
youre christie
you are to respond only to christie
is that clear
its a very fine chardonnay youre drinking
i want you to clean your vagina
no from behind
get on your knees
you have a very nice body
thank you send her up
christie get out and dry off choose a robe
not the bijan
then come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks
youve arrived how lovely
let me take your coat im paul
how good of you to come
not quite blonde are you
more dirty blonde
im going to call you sabrina
im paul allen
so
dont you want to know what i do
no
no not really
well i work on wall street
at pierce  pierce
have you heard of it
you have a really nice place here paul
how much did you pay for it
well actually thats none of your business
but i can assure you
it certainly wasnt cheap
no no smoking not in here
varda truffle
i dont want you to get drunk but
thats a very fine chardonnay
youre not drinking
do you like phil collins
ive been a big genesis fan ever since
the release of their 1980 album
duke
before that i really didnt understand
any of their work
its too artsy too intellectual
it was on duke where phil collins
presence became more apparent
i think invisible touch is
the groups undisputed masterpiece
its an epic meditation on intangibility
at the same time
it deepens and enriches
the meaning
of the preceding three albums
christie take off the robe
listen to the brilliant ensemble playing
of banks collins and rutherford
you can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument
sabrina remove your dress
in terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer song writing
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism
sabrina why dont you dance a little
take the lyrics to land of confusion
in this song phil collins addresses
the problems of abusive political authority
in too deep is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s
about monogamy and commitment
the song is extremely uplifting
their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative
as anything ive heard in rock
christie get down on your knees
so sabrina can see your asshole
phil collins solo career
seems to be more commercial
and therefore
more satisfying in a narrower way
especially songs like in the air tonight
and against all odds
sabrina dont just stare at it eat it
i also think that phil collins works best
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist
and i stress the word artist
this is sussudio a great great song
a personal favourite
dont touch the watch
can we go now
were not through yet
if they have a good personality
and arent great looking then who cares
lets say hypothetically okay
what if they have a good personality
i know i know
there are no girls
with good personalities
a good personality consists
of a chick with a hardbody
wholl satisfy all sexual demands
without being too slutty
and wholl keep her dumb
fucking mouth shut
the only girls with good personalities
smart
funny halfway intelligent or talented
though god knows what the fuck
that means are ugly chicks
this is because they have to make up
for how fucking ugly they are
you know what ed gein said
ed gein maître d at canal bar
no serial killer wisconsin in the 50s
and what did ed say
when i see a pretty girl
i think of two things
one part of me wants to take her out
talk to her be real nice and sweet
and treat her right
what did the other part of him think
what her head would look like on a stick
hi guys i want to get your opinion
on something
its my business card
i decided to get a new one too
very nice luis
thank you
what about dinner
is that all you ever have to contribute
what about fucking dinner
cheer up there whats the matter
no shiatsu today
touch me again
and youll draw back a stump
hold on there little buddy
excuse me
patrick why here
ive seen you looking at me
ive noticed your
hot body
dont be shy
you cant imagine how long ive wanted
this ever since that party at arizona 206
you know the one you were wearing that
red striped paisley armani tie
i want you
i want you too
patrick
what is it
where are you going
ive got to return some video tapes
ill call you
ive been wanting to talk with you
come in to my office
jean great jacket matsuda

the night of pauls disappearance
which was on december 20
god i guess
i was probably returning videotapes
