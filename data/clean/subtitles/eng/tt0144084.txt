and i also have an arugula caesar salad 
for entrees  i have swordfish meatloaf
with onion marmalade 
rare roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale 
and grilled free range rabbit
with herb french fries 
our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth   
god  i hate this place 
it s a chick s restaurant 
why not dorsia 
because bateman won t give
the maître d  head 
is that reed robinson 
  you freebasing  that s not robinson 
  who is it then 
  that s paul allen 
  that s not paul allen 
  paul allen s on the other side of the room 
  who s he with 
some weasel from kicker peabody 
can t do coke in this bathroom 
  are you sure that s paul allen 
  yes  mcdufus 
he handles the fisher account 
  lucky bastard 
  lucky jew bastard 
what does that have to do with anything 
i ve seen that bastard in his office
on the phone with ceo s   
   spinning a fucking menorah 
  not a menorah  you spin a dreidel 
oh  my god  do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes 
  some latkes 
  no  just   
   cool it with the anti semitic remarks 
i forgot  bateman s dating someone
from the aclu 
the voice of reason  the boy next door 
speaking of reasonable   
   only  570 
not bad 
two stoli on the rocks 
these aren t good any more 
it s a cash bar 
that will be  25 
you re a fucking ugly bitch 
i want to stab you to death
and play around with your blood 
i live in the american gardens building
on west 81st street   
    on the 11th floor 
my name is patrick bateman 
i m 27 years old 
i believe in taking care of myself   
    in a balanced diet
and a rigorous exercise routine 
in the morning  if my face is a little puffy   
    l ll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches 
i can do 1 000 now 
after i remove the ice pack 
i use a deep pore cleanser lotion 
in the shower 
i use a water activated gel cleanser   
    then  a honey almond body scrub   
    and on the face  an exfoliating gel scrub 
then  i apply a herb mint facial mask   
    which i leave on for 10 minutes 
while i prepare the rest of my routine 
i always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol   
    because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older   
    then  moisturiser   
    then  an anti ageing eye balm   
    followed by
a final moisturising protective lotion 
there is an idea of a patrick bateman   
    some kind of abstraction 
but there is no real me   
    only an entity  something illusory 
and though i can hide my cold gaze   
    and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours   
    and maybe you can even sense
our lifestyles are probably comparable   
    i simply am not there 
morning  hamilton  nice tan 
  late 
  aerobics class  sorry  any messages 
ricky harrison cancelled  he didn t say
what he was cancelling or why 
i occasionally box with ricky

a mineral water  okay 
  you look nice today 
  don t wear that outfit again 
what  i didn t hear you 
i said   do not wear that outfit again  
wear a dress  a skirt or something 
  you don t like this  i take it 
  come on   
   you re prettier than that 
thanks  patrick 
i m not here  and high heels 
i like high heels 
hundreds  thousands of roses 
and lots of chocolate truffles  godiva 
and oysters on the half shell 
i m listening
to the new robert palmer tape   
    but evelyn  my supposed fiancée 
keeps buzzing in my ear 
photographers 
annie leibovitz  we ll get annie leibovitz 
and we ll have to get someone
to videotape it 
patrick  we should do it 
do what 
  get married 
  no  i can t take the time off work 
your father owns the company 
you can do anything  silly 
  i don t want to talk about it 
  you hate that job anyway 
i don t see why you just don t quit 
because i want to fit in 
williams  party 
i m on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at espace   
    since i m positive
we won t have a decent table 
but we do 
and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave 
this is my cousin 
vanden  and her boyfriend  stash 
  they re both artists 
  the menu is in braille 
i m fairly certain that timothy bryce
and evelyn are having an affair 
timothy is the only interesting person
i know 
i m almost completely indifferent
as to whether evelyn knows   
    l m having an affair
with courtney rawlinson   
    her closest friend 
courtney is almost perfect looking 
she usually operates
on one or more psychiatric drugs 
tonight  i believe it s xanax 
more disturbing than her drug use 
though   
    is the fact that she s engaged
to luis carruthers 
  the biggest dufus in the business 
  tell me  stash   
   do you think soho is becoming
too commercial 
yes  i read that 
who gives a rat s ass 
that affects us 
what about the massacres
in sri lanka  honey 
doesn t that affect us too 
do you know anything about sri lanka 
the sikhs are killing tons of israelis 
come on  bryce  there are a lot more
important problems than sri lanka   
   to worry about 
  like what 
we have to end apartheid for one 
and slow down the nuclear arms race 
stop terrorism and world hunger 
we have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless 
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights   
   while also promoting equal rights
for women 
we have to encourage a return   
   to traditional  moral values 
most importantly  we have to promote
general social concern 
and less materialism in young people 
patrick   
   how thought provoking 
hello

  dorsia 
  yes 
i know it s late  but is it possible to reserve
a table for two at 8 00 or 8 30 perhaps 
a facial at elizabeth arden 
which was really relaxing   
   and then to the pottery barn   
   where i got this little silver muffin dish 
  is that donald trump s car 
  oh god  patrick  shut up 
you should take more lithium
or have a diet coke 
some caffeine might get you
out of this slump 
i just want a child 
just two perfect   
   children 
  are we here 
  yeah 
this is dorsia 
yes  dear 
you re gonna have the peanut butter soup
with smoked duck and mashed squash 
new york matinée called it 
 a playful but mysterious little dish  
you ll love it 
and then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts 
i think that ll follow nicely 
thanks  patrick 
patrick  thanks so much
for looking after courtney 
dorsia  how impressive 
how on earth did you get a reservation 
lucky  i guess 
that s a wonderful suit 
don t tell me  let me guess 
valentino couture 
it looks so soft 
your compliment was sufficient  luis 
hello  halberstram  nice tie 
how the hell are you 
allen has mistaken me for this dickhead 
marcus halberstram 
it seems logical because
marcus also works at p   p   
    and does the same exact thing i do 
he also has a penchant for valentino suits
and oliver people s glasses 
we even go to the same barber 
although i have a slightly better haircut 
so how s the ransom account going 
  it s all right 
  really  that s interesting  it s not   
   great 
  well  you know 
  so how s cecelia  she s a great girl 
  yeah 
  i m very lucky 
  hey  allen

  look at this 
  that is really nice 
eggshell with romalian type 
what do you think 
nice 
jesus  that is really super 
how d a nitwit like you get so tasteful 
i can t believe that bryce prefers
van patten s card to mine 
but wait  you ain t seen nothin  yet 
raised lettering  pale nimbus 
white 
impressive  very nice 
let s see paul allen s card 
look at that subtle off white colouring 
the tasteful thickness of it 
oh  my god  it even has a watermark

patrick  you re sweating

do you know what a fucking loser you are 
what beautiful skin you have 
mr  bateman 
so fine  so smooth 
i have all the characteristics
of a human being 
flesh  blood  skin  hair 
but not a single clear 
identifiable emotion   
    except for greed and disgust 
something horrible is happening
inside of me 
and i don t know why 
my nightly bloodlust has overflowed
into my days 
i feel lethal  on the verge of frenzy 
i think my mask of sanity is about to slip 
hey  mccloy  what do you say

marcus halberstram for two at 7 00 
no  i want to know   
okay  i came here
for the cilantro fish gumbo  all right 
it s the only excuse one could have
for being here  which is   
   by the way  almost completely empty 
  i m very sorry  sir 
  j   b straight and a corona 
  would you like to   
  double absolut martini 
yes  sir 
  would you like to hear the specials 
  not if you want to keep your spleen 
this is a real beehive of activity 
halberstram 
this place is hot  very hot 
the mud soup and the charcoal arugula
are outrageous here 
yeah  well  you re late 
i m a child of divorce  give me a break 
i see they ve omitted the pork loin
with lime jello 
we should ve gone to dorsia 
  i could ve gotten us a table 
  nobody goes there anymore 
is that lvana trump 
jeez  patrick  i mean marcus 
what are you thinking 
why would lvana be at texarkana 
so  wasn t rothschild originally handling
the fisher account 
how d you get it 
i could tell you that  halberstram   
   but then i d have to kill you 
i like to dissect girls 
did you know i m utterly insane 
great tan  marcus  really impressive 
  where do you tan 
  salon 
i ve got a tanning bed at home 
you should look into it 
and cecelia  how is she 
  where is she tonight 
  well  you know cecelia   
i think she s having dinner
with evelyn williams 
evelyn 
great ass  goes out with that loser 
patrick bateman  what a dork 
another martini  paul 
you like huey lewis   the news 
they re okay 
their early work was
a little too new wave for my taste 
but when sports came out in  83   
   i think they really came into their own 
commercially and artistically 
the whole album has a clear  crisp sound   
   and a new sheen
of consummate professionalism   
   that really gives the songs a big boost 
he s been compared to elvis costello 
but i think huey has a far more bitter 
cynical sense of humour 
  hey  halberstram 
  yes  allen 
why are there copies of the style section
all over the place 
do you have a dog 
a little chow or something 
no  allen 
  is that a raincoat 
  yes  it is 
in 1987  huey released this 
four  their most accomplished album 
i think their undisputed masterpiece is
hip to be square 
a song so catchy that most people
probably don t listen to the lyrics 
but they should because it s not just
about the pleasures of conformity   
   and the importance of trends  it s also
a personal statement about the band itself 
hey  paul 
try getting a reservation at dorsia now 
you fucking stupid bastard 
patrick  patrick 
  is that you 
  no  luis  it s not me 
you re mistaken 
this is my very good friend 
patrick bateman 
where are you going 
we re going to nell s 
gwendolyn s father is buying it 
where did you get that overnight bag 
jean paul gaultier 
when i get to paul allen s place 
i use the keys i took from his pocket   
    before disposing of the body 
there is a moment of sheer panic   
    when i realise that paul s apartment
overlooks the park 
and is obviously more expensive
than mine 
i calm myself 
and move into the bedroom   
    where i find his suitcase and
start to pack 
it s time for paul to take a little trip 
where to send the bastard 
dallas 
paris  singapore  london 
i ll send the asshole to london 
hi  this is paul 
i ve been called to london for a few days 
meredith  i ll call you when i get back 
hasta la vista  baby 
what is it 
patrick  it s just   
yes  jean 
  mr  donald kimball is here to see you 
  who 
detective donald kimball 
tell him i m at lunch 
patrick  it s only 10 30 
i think he knows you re here 
send him in  i guess 
now john  you ve got to wear clothes
in proportion to your physique 
there are definite do s and don ts 
good buddy  of wearing a bold stripe shirt 
a bold striped shirt calls for solid coloured
or discreetly patterned suits and ties 
yes  always tip the stylist 15  
listen john  i ve got to go 
t  bone pickens just walked in 
just joking 
no  don t tip the owner of the salon 
okay john  right  got it 
sorry 
no  i m sorry 
i should ve made an appointment 
was that anything important 
that  just mulling
over business problems 
examining opportunities 
exchanging rumours 
spreading gossip 
hi  i m donald kimball 
  hi  pat bateman  nice to meet you 
  sorry to barge in on you like this 
i know how busy you guys can get 
so  what s the   
   topic of discussion 
  i ve been hired by meredith powell   
   to investigate the disappearance
of paul allen 
i see  paul s disappearance  yeah 
it s nothing that official 
i just have some basic questions
about paul and yourself 
  coffee 
  no  i m okay 
  apollinaris 
  no  i m okay 
  can you bring mr   
  kimball 
  a bottle of   
  no  really  i m okay 
it s no problem 
so  what s the topic of discussion 
disappearance of paul allen 
right  well  i   
i haven t heard anything
about the disappearance or anything 
not on page six  at least 
  his family wants this kept quiet 
  understandable 
  lime 
  no  really  i m okay 
sure  i can get you a lime 
just some preliminary questions
that i need for my own files  okay 
shoot 
  how old are you 
  27 
  where did you go to school 
  harvard  the harvard business school 
your address 
american gardens building 
west 81st street 
nice  very nice 
thanks 
  what can you tell me about paul allen 
  i m at a loss 
  he was part of that whole yale thing 
  yale thing 
yeah  yale thing 
what do you mean 
well  i think for one that
he was probably a closet homosexual   
   who did a lot of cocaine  that yale thing 
what kind of a man was he  besides
the information you ve just given me 
  i hope i m not being cross examined here 
  do you feel like that 
no  not really 
where did paul hang out 
  hang out 
  yeah  you know  hang out 
let me think 
the newport  harry s  fluties 
indochine  nell s  the cornell club 
  the new york yacht club 
  he had a yacht 
  no  he just hung out there 
  and where did he go to school 
  don t you know this 
  i just wanted to know if you know 
before yale 
if i remember correctly  saint paul s 
listen  i just want to help 
i understand 
any witnesses or fingerprints 
there s a message on his answering
machine that says he went to london 
  maybe he did 
  his girlfriend doesn t think so 
  has anyone seen him in london 
  actually  yes 
but i ve had difficulty getting
an actual verification 
a stephen hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there 
but i checked it out and what happened is 
he mistook a herbert ainsworth for paul 
  had his apartment been burglarised 
  no  actually it hadn t 
toiletries were missing  a suit was gone 
so was some luggage  that s it 
anyone dealing with the homicide squad 
no  not yet  as i said  we re not sure 
basically  no one s seen or heard anything 
  so typical  isn t it 
  it s just strange 
one day someone s walking around 
going to work   
   alive  and then   
  nothing 
people just disappear 
the earth just opens up
and swallows them 
eerie  really eerie 
you ll have to excuse me 
i have a meeting with cliff huxtable   
   at the four seasons in 20 minutes 
the four seasons 
isn t that a little far uptown 
aren t you going to be late 
no  there s one down here 
  really  i didn t know that 
  yes  it s very good 
listen  if anything occurs to you 
any information   
absolutely  i m 100  with you 
great  and thanks for your time 
mr  bateman 
  bye bye 
  bye 
  i haven t seen you around here 
  you just haven t been looking 
would you like to see my apartment 
i m not supposed to 
do you want to come
to my apartment or not 
i m not supposed to 
but i can make an exception 
do you take a credit card 
i m joking  come on  get in 
i d like a girl  early twenties  blonde 
who does couples 
couples  i really can t stress
blonde enough 
blonde 
i m paul  my name is paul allen 
you got that 
you re christie 
you are to respond only to christie 
is that clear 
it s a very fine chardonnay you re drinking 
i want you to clean your vagina 
no  from behind 
get on your knees 
you have a very nice body 
thank you  send her up 
christie  get out and dry off  choose a robe 
not the bijan 
then  come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks 
you ve arrived  how lovely 
let me take your coat  i m paul 
how good of you to come 
not quite blonde  are you 
more dirty blonde 
i m going to call you sabrina 
i m paul allen 
so   
   don t you want to know what i do 
no 
no  not really 
well  i work on wall street 
at pierce   pierce 
have you heard of it 
you have a really nice place here  paul 
how much did you pay for it 
well actually  that s none of your business 
but i can assure you 
it certainly wasn t cheap 
no  no smoking  not in here 
varda truffle 
i don t want you to get drunk  but   
   that s a very fine chardonnay
you re not drinking 
do you like phil collins 
i ve been a big genesis fan ever since
the release of their 1980 album   
    duke 
before that i really didn t understand
any of their work 
it s too artsy  too intellectual 
it was on duke  where phil collins 
presence became more apparent 
i think invisible touch is
the group s undisputed masterpiece 
it s an epic meditation on intangibility 
at the same time 
it deepens and enriches   
   the meaning
of the preceding three albums 
christie  take off the robe 
listen to the brilliant ensemble playing
of banks  collins  and rutherford 
you can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument 
sabrina  remove your dress 
in terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer song writing   
   this album hits a new peak
of professionalism 
sabrina  why don t you dance a little 
take the lyrics to land of confusion   
   in this song  phil collins addresses
the problems of abusive political authority 
in too deep is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s   
   about monogamy and commitment 
the song is extremely uplifting 
their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative   
   as anything i ve heard in rock 
christie  get down on your knees 
so sabrina can see your asshole 
phil collins  solo career   
   seems to be more commercial   
   and therefore 
more satisfying in a narrower way   
   especially songs like in the air tonight
and against all odds 
sabrina  don t just stare at it  eat it 
i also think that phil collins works best
within the confines of the group   
   than as a solo artist 
and i stress the word  artist  
this is sussudio  a great  great song 
a personal favourite 
don t touch the watch 
can we go now 
we re not through yet 
if they have a good personality
and aren t great looking  then who cares 
let s say hypothetically  okay 
what if they have a good personality 
i know  i know 
 there are no girls
with good personalities  
a good personality consists
of a chick with a hardbody   
   who ll satisfy all sexual demands
without being too slutty   
   and who ll keep her dumb 
fucking mouth shut 
the only girls with good personalities 
smart   
   funny  halfway intelligent  or talented   
   though god knows what the fuck
that means  are ugly chicks 
this is because they have to make up
for how fucking ugly they are 
  you know what ed gein said 
  ed gein  maître d  at canal bar 
  no  serial killer  wisconsin in the  50s 
  and what did ed say 
 when i see a pretty girl 
i think of two things   
    one part of me wants to take her out   
    talk to her  be real nice and sweet
and treat her right  
what did the other part of him think 
what her head would look like on a stick 
hi  guys  i want to get your opinion
on something 
it s my business card 
i decided to get a new one  too 
very nice  luis 
thank you
