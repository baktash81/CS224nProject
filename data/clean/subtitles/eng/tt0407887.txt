to be a product of me
years ago we had the church
that was only a way
of saying we had each other
but now i dont know
its a funny thing
it put hate in your heart
the knights of columbus were
real headbreakers
true guineas
they took over their piece of the city
twenty years after an irishman couldnt get
a fucking job
we had the presidency
may he rest in peace
thats what the niggers dont realize
if i got one thing
against the black chappies its this
no one gives it to you
you have to take it
vin dont make me have
to come down here again for this
wont happen again mr c
carmens developing
into a fine young lady
you should be proud
you get your period yet carmen
you johnny sullivans kid
you live with your grandmother

vin get him a couple loaves of bread
couple halfgallons of milk
do you like bologna and cheese

thanks
to you o lord we commend the soul
of alphonsus your servant
in the sight of this world
he is now dead
forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness
amen
the church wants you in your place
kneel stand kneel stand
if you go for that sort of thing
i dont know what to do for you
a man makes his own way
no one gives it to you
you have to take it
james joyce
smart colin
guineas from the north end
down providence
tried to tell me what to do
and something maybe happened to them
maybe like that
jeez she fell funny
francis you really should see somebody
when you decide to be something
you can be it
thats what they dont tell you
in the church
when i was your age they would say
we could become cops or criminals
today what im saying to you is this
when youre facing a loaded gun
whats the difference
thats my boy
terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile
as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes
take for instance what you carry
9mm hollowpoint
when the hollowpoint hits the skull
what happens is it mushrooms
when it mushrooms it peels back
so you may have six eight
ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades
sir yes sir
tearing their internal organs
their liver their lungs their heart
bringing tissue bone blood
brain matter and thats called a blowback
fuck you fucking queers
firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy
hey go save a kitten in a tree
you fucking homos
pencils
begin
what are you looking at
forget it
your father was a janitor
his sons only a cop
those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos
they are
so she tells me you never finish anything
you finish the police course
you get taken care of again baby

your mother must be a wonderful woman

fuck yourself
im tired from fucking your wife
hows your mother

good today girls
what i have is microprocessors
somebody as you may already know
stole 20 microprocessors
from the mass processor company
out on route 128
these are the kind
they put into computers
that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel
from a couple hundred miles away
these pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece
we got a guy working
for the company two months
walks out the door with
a box of processors on tuesday
has a ticket for florida
on wednesday
but on thursday he gets found
in a dumpster
you know where that dirtball
started his life
southie projects
what was his name the departed
myles kennefick
got the job with a forged umass
transcript umass boston
which happens to
south boston
oh youre a fucking genius
who forged your transcript dickhead
his old man runs
the hibernian liquor mart kenneficks
were not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag
were here to nail costello
all right look we got a guy
says costellos moving
the processors to china
he set up the whole fucking job
and popped kennefick
you do not want to miss it
if costello takes a dump
wed miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the bureau
without asking for too many details
do you have anyone in with costello now
maybe maybe not
maybe fuck yourself
my theory on feds
is theyre like mushrooms
feed them shit
and keep them in the dark
you girls have a good day
normally hes a very nice guy
dont judge him from this meeting alone
now mrs kennefick i knew your son
i knew myles
he was younger than me
but he was behind me in school
i wanna get these people
who did this to him
would you like to help us
you wanna help catch the people
who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him

allegedly

he probably did something wrong
but not the robbery thats not wrong
he did something else wrong

ill get you something out of it
i tell you mr costello
id like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it
smartmouth
too bad
if youll indulge me
now what
choir practice
choir practice
the point im making
with john lennon is
a man could look at anything
and make something out of it
for instance
i look at you and i think
what could i use you for
get rid of this
french
put it downstairs here
go ahead thank you
maybe we could work something out
good
and send this to his wife
it was nice the way
you asked the guy
which hand he jerked off with
i hope this dont shake rita up
as i remember
she aint that sentimental
that was quick
you think hes dead already
we have to do it by phone
i wont do it
if i have to wear a wire
no wires understand
you dont know what this is like
microprocessors
micro what
microprocessors
well probably be at war
with the chinese in 20odd years
and costello is selling them
military technology
microprocessors chips computer parts
anybody says anything about
anything like that
you let us know
so who did the two guys
from providence
jimmy pappas
what happened to jimmy pappas
jimmy had a rough month
jimmy had a heart attack in jail
and then he got himself knifed
at boston city hospital
i believe its been in the papers
you seem quite happy with that result
its a fucking result
yeah but cui bono who benefits
cui gives a shit
its got a frigging bow on it
i think you are a cop my son
wheres your license
what license
i dont see none theres no such thing
as a license of course
but you you definitely need
to have fucking one
if youre not being run by us
youre being run by someone else
that means youre bringing
undesirable elements
into mr costellos area
i was going for my fucking cigarettes
hey
thats jimmy bags
he was rea i dont know
what the fuck you doing
im in the hole
i pay him two grand
theres no profit i pay him two grand
then make more money
this is america
you dont make money youre
a douche bag now what you gonna do
make more money
thats the spirit
oh fuck
dont worry about it
the guy dont need
any fucking teeth anyway
its a small surveillance subunit
but its mine
i didnt take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up
i handpicked this group
youre my a team now our prim
hi captain
this crazy fuck
knocked jimmy bags teeth out
so
he was
he was reaching for his cigarettes
youre gonna give me shit
it wasnt for no reason frank
he reached into his coat
i dont know if hes a bookie
or what hes doing
well you do know
what a bookie does dont you
yeah yeah he pays you
queenans compartmentalizing
everything in siu
which is the right thing
i dont trust half the troopers
out there anymore
bottom line
we think we might have a problem
we think costellos got a rat
in the state police
really
yeah really
do we have direct access
to queenans undercovers
no no not presently
but im working on that
here bill this is for you

hi dad
i got promoted all right
excuse me for one second
you know
if your father were alive
and saw you here sitting with me
lets say hed have a word with me
about this
in fact hed kill seven guys
just to cut my throat
and he could do it
which is maybe something
you dont know about william costigan sr
so he never i mean never
no no no
he kept his own counsel
he never wanted money
you cant do anything
with a man like that
your uncle jackie
he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you
and i think about this
so what the fuck
are we talking about here
did you ever think about

sometimes they cry yeah
if theyve had trouble at home
if theyve had to use their weapons
use their weapons
let me tell you something
they signed up to use their weapons
most of them all right

so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons
there is no one more full of shit
than a cop
except for a cop on tv

you dont pay much you know
its almost a fucking feudal enterprise
the question is

better than you
the only one
who could do what i do is me
