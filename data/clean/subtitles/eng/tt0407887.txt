to be a product of me 
years ago  we had the church 
that was only a way
of saying we had each other 
but now  i don t know 
it s a funny thing 
it put hate in your heart 
the knights of columbus were
real head breakers 
true guineas 
they took over their piece of the city 
twenty years after an irishman couldn t get
a fucking job   
   we had the presidency 
may he rest in peace 
that s what the niggers don t realize 
if i got one thing
against the black chappies  it s this 
no one gives it to you 
you have to take it 
vin  don t make me have
to come down here again for this 
won t happen again  mr  c 
carmen s developing
into a fine young lady 
you should be proud 
you get your period yet  carmen 
you johnny sullivan s kid 
  you live with your grandmother 
  yeah 
vin  get him a couple loaves of bread 
couple half gallons of milk 
do you like bologna and cheese 
give him some cold cuts 
throw some mayo in 
you like comic books 
you do good in school 
  yeah 
  that s good  i did too 
they call that a paradox 
just keep it  buy yourself some makeup 
you ever wanna earn a little extra money 
you come by l street 
you know where i am on l street 
good 
  good boy 
  thanks 
to you  o lord  we commend the soul
of alphonsus  your servant 
in the sight of this world 
he is now dead 
forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness 
  amen 
  the church wants you in your place 
kneel  stand  kneel  stand 
if you go for that sort of thing 
i don t know what to do for you 
a man makes his own way 
no one gives it to you 
you have to take it 
  james joyce 
  smart  colin 
guineas from the north end 
down providence   
   tried to tell me what to do 
and something maybe happened to them 
maybe like that 
jeez  she fell funny 
francis  you really should see somebody 
when you decide to be something 
you can be it 
that s what they don t tell you
in the church 
when i was your age  they would say
we could become cops or criminals 
today what i m saying to you is this 
when you re facing a loaded gun   
   what s the difference 
that s my boy 
terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile   
   as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes 
take  for instance  what you carry 
9mm hollow point 
when the hollow point hits the skull 
what happens is it mushrooms 
when it mushrooms it peels back 
so you may have six  eight   
   ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades   
sir  yes  sir 
   tearing their internal organs 
their liver  their lungs  their heart   
   bringing tissue  bone  blood 
brain matter  and that s called a blowback 
fuck you  fucking queers 
firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy 
hey  go save a kitten in a tree 
you fucking homos 
pencils 
begin 
what are you looking at 
forget it 
your father was a janitor 
his son s only a cop 
those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos 
they are 
so she tells me   you never finish anything 
you finish the police course   
   you get taken care of again  baby  
so after graduation  i get a blowjob again

your mother must be a wonderful woman

  i m tired from fucking your wife 
  how s your mother 
  tired from fucking my father 
good  today  girls   
   what i have is microprocessors 
somebody  as you may already know 
stole 20 microprocessors   
   from the mass processor company
out on route 128 
these are the kind
they put into computers   
   that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel   
   from a couple hundred miles away 
these pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece 
we got a guy working
for the company two months   
   walks out the door with
a box of processors on tuesday   
   has a ticket for florida
on wednesday   
   but on thursday  he gets found
in a dumpster 
you know where that dirtball
started his life 
southie projects

we re here to nail costello 
all right  look  we got a guy   
   says costello s moving
the processors to china 
he set up the whole fucking job
and popped kennefick 
you do not want to miss it
if costello takes a dump 
we d miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the bureau 
without asking for too many details 
do you have anyone in with costello now

i saw a dead guy  i think i m having
posttraumatic stress 
can i meet you for lunch 
all right  see you then 
who s the lead detective 
good  he s a lox 
get the cops to look at jimmy pappas
for the hit  he had nothing to do with it   
   and he ll say so 
look in his car  you ll find the gun
that did it  registered  official  providence 
in the trunk or the glove compartment 
hey  you wanna see some dead guys 
hey  this will get captain ellerby
on the 6 00 news 
no wonder you get ahead 
have a seat  bill 
do you know john lennon 
yeah  sure  he was the president
before lincoln 
lennon said 
 i m an artist 
you give me a fucking tuba 
i ll get you something out of it  
i tell you  mr  costello   
   i d like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it 
smart mouth 
too bad 
if you ll indulge me   
now what 
choir practice 
choir practice   
the point i m making
with john lennon is   
   a man could look at anything   
   and make something out of it 
for instance   
   i look at you and i think 
what could i use you for 
get rid of this 
french 
put it downstairs  here 
go ahead  thank you 
maybe we could work something out 
  good 
  and send this to his wife 
it was nice the way
you asked the guy   
   which hand he jerked off with 
i hope this don t shake rita up 
as i remember 
she ain t that sentimental 
that was quick 
you think he s dead already 
we have to do it by phone 
i won t do it   
   if i have to wear a wire 
no wires  understand 
  you don t know what this is like 
  microprocessors 
  micro what 
  microprocessors 
we ll probably be at war
with the chinese in 20 odd years   
   and costello is selling them
military technology 
microprocessors  chips  computer parts 
anybody says anything about
anything like that   
   you let us know 
so who did the two guys
from providence 
jimmy pappas 
what happened to jimmy pappas 
jimmy had a rough month 
jimmy had a heart attack in jail   
   and then he got himself knifed
at boston city hospital 
i believe it s been in the papers 
you seem quite happy with that result 
it s a fucking result 
yeah  but cui bono  who benefits 
cui gives a shit 
it s got a frigging bow on it 
i think you are a cop  my son 
  where s your license 
  what license 
i don t see none  there s no such thing
as a license  of course 
but you  you definitely need
to have fucking one 
if you re not being run by us 
you re being run by someone else 
that means you re bringing
undesirable elements   
   into mr  costello s area 
i was going for my fucking cigarettes 
hey 
that s jimmy bags 
  he was rea    i don t know 
  what the fuck you doing 
i m in the hole 
i pay him two grand 
there s no profit  i pay him two grand 
then make more money 
this is america 
you don t make money  you re
a douche bag  now what you gonna do 
  make more money 
  that s the spirit 
  oh  fuck 
  don t worry about it 
the guy don t need
any fucking teeth anyway 
it s a small surveillance subunit 
but it s mine 
i didn t take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up 
i handpicked this group 
you re my a team  now  our prim   
hi  captain 
this crazy fuck   
      knocked jimmy bags  teeth out 
  so 
  he was   
  he was reaching for his cigarettes 
you re gonna give me shit 
it wasn t for no reason  frank 
he reached into his coat 
i don t know if he s a bookie
or what he s doing 
well  you do know
what a bookie does  don t you 
yeah  yeah  he pays you 
queenan s compartmentalizing
everything in siu   
   which is the right thing 
i don t trust half the troopers
out there anymore 
bottom line   
   we think we might have a problem 
we think costello s got a rat
in the state police 
  really 
  yeah  really 
do we have direct access
to queenan s undercovers 
no  no  not presently 
but i m working on that 
here  bill  this is for you 
from now on  call the bar 
ask for mikey  just mikey 
you ask for mikey
because there is no mikey 
you wait  we ll call you 
  you got that 
  yeah  i got that 
  sorry  i didn t hear you 
  i got that 
good 
hi  dad 
i got promoted  all right 
excuse me for one second 
you know   
   if your father were alive   
   and saw you here sitting with me   
   let s say he d have a word with me
about this 
in fact  he d kill seven guys
just to cut my throat 
and he could do it   
   which is maybe something
you don t know about william costigan sr 
  so he never     i mean  never 
  no  no  no 
he kept his own counsel 
he never wanted money 
you can t do anything
with a man like that 
your uncle jackie   
   he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you 
and i think about this 
so what the fuck
are we talking about here 
did you ever think about
going back to school 
school 
with all due respect  mr  costello   
   school is out 
maybe someday
you ll wake the fuck up 
good day  fathers

it s actually quite common 
i gotta go to work 
do you lie 
why  do you 
no  i m asking if you lie 
honesty is not synonymous with truth 
yeah  you lie 
you lie 
is it to do some good 
to get somewhere personally   
   or  what  just for the fuck of it 
well  i expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel 
so you had a parent who was a drunk 
did you 
no 
let s keep it with you 
talk about how you feel 
how i feel 
how i feel 
  fuck 
  brian  stop it

ain t gonna hurt you 
you sit there   
   with a mass murderer 
a mass murderer 
your heart rate is jacked 
and your hand   
   steady 
that s one thing i figured out about myself
in prison  my hand   
   does not shake 
ever 
wake the fuck up 
there was a cop leaving when i came in 
how did you know he was a cop 
bad haircut  no dress sense and a slight 
you know  air of scumbag entitlement 
  do you see cops 
  that s part of what i do 
i normally don t see cadets
who ve been kicked out of the academy 
oh  boy 
you should get a better job  huh 
should i 
so do they all come in here   
   and cry  your cops 
sometimes they do  yeah  sure 
sometimes they cry  yeah 
if they ve had trouble at home 
if they ve had to use their weapons   
use their weapons 
let me tell you something 
they signed up to use their weapons 
most of them  all right 
but they watch enough tv   
   so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons 
there is no one more full of shit
than a cop 
except for a cop on tv 
i looked at your file 
i see that you have a record of assault 
yeah 
so what was it like for you in jail 
what  you wanna hear about the showers 
is that what you wanna hear about 
did something happen to you 
no 
  okay  let s do this  come on  spread them 
  hey  you think you can pop somebody

  i thought i was supposed to tell   
      the truth here  if only fucking here 
  you are  yes 
a guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy  of self reliance that he has   
   and what do you do

street to score smack  is that what you do 
you re fucking ridiculous

   to come to a business transaction   
   with automatic weapons 
for his own good  tell bruce lee
and the karate kids   
   none of us are carrying
automatic weapons 
because here  in this country

like some douche bags i could mention   
  any calls

search randomly for calls
made from the area 
eight hundred and seven phones

then narrow the area 
what you see there for service
is what you re gonna get 
why did they turn their phones off 
  wait  there s still one phone up

the buyers are there

would have its advantages 
not to my guy

i m the guy who does his job 
you must be the other guy 
if these chinks wanna nuke taiwan
any time in this century   
   they d better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars 
what we generally do  in this country   
   is one guy   
   brings the items   
   and the other guy   
   pays him 
no  tickee    
   no laundry 
go ahead  fitz

it won t be me who suffers for it 
now  why would you have to
remind me of that 
would i be any good at what i do
if i didn t fucking already know that 
frank  you gotta trust me 
all right  just trust me  frank 
hey  it fucking involves lying
and i m pretty fucking good at that  right 
right 
maybe because
it s always been so easy   
   for me to get cunt that i never understood
jerking off in a theater 
christ 
who knows what s easy 
colin  i know you ll take care
of business 
shit

in this business 
stupid  huh 
well  i guess that leaves me out 
you know  past days  situation like this 
i kill everybody 
everybody who works for me 
right  you know  frank   
   i look around at your other guys   
i mean  they re all murderers  right 
right 
and i think   could i do murder  
and all i can answer myself is 
 what s the difference  
give them up to the almighty 
you see  that s my point  you know 
you accuse me once  i put up with it 
you accuse me twice   
   i quit 
you pressure me to fear for my life and
i will put a fucking bullet in your head   
   as if you were anybody else  okay 
you got something
you wanna ask me 
look  you re 70 years old  frank 
i m just saying  okay 
one of your guys is gonna pop you 
  one of your guys is gonna pop you 
  yeah  yeah 
as for running drugs 
what the fuck are you doing 
you don t need the money or the pain
in the ass  and they will catch you 
i haven t needed the money   
   since i took archie s milk money
in the third grade 
tell you the truth 
i don t need pussy anymore  either

that you re pretty good at what you do 
sure  sure  will 
you  william  what would you do 
frank  how many of these guys   
   have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled 
think about it 
you don t pay much  you know 
it s almost a fucking feudal enterprise 
the question is 
and this is the only question   
   who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you 
the only one
who could do what i do is me 
lot of people had to die
for me to be me
