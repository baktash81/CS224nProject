buck

wow buck
what an adventure huh
its okay boy
youre home
there is a place
in these mountains
where a new breed
of timber wolf roams
wiser than man or wolf
because of the dog
that runs at the head
of the pack
now they live without fear
raise their young
and flourish
some say its just a legend
not so
you see i knew him once
when he was just a dog
at a mans side
and even though
this land is his
every summer
when he comes down
to the valley
he remembers kind hands
and old masters
before he went to his own
became his own master
before he heard
the call
ill follow you anywhere
where you wanna go
yeah i dont care
let the river drown
all our fears
if the pouring rain
washes you away
ill go with you babe
cause if you fall
i will follow you
into the great unknown
where wild winds blow
if you lose it all
you know ill be there
when everybodys gone
youre not alone
cause ill follow you oh
where the wild winds blow
so dont you disappear
cause this road aint
so lonely when youre near
theres no going
back from here
if your sky turns gray
and youre losing faith
im with you all the way
cause if you fall
i will follow you
into the great unknown
where wild winds blow
if you lose it all
you know ill be there
when everybodys gone
