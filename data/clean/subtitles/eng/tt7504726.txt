it was the mountains 
he spent all day
looking at maps
and at pictures
of the mountains 
dreaming about
what was on the other side 
places no one had been 
wild places 
 let s go   i said 
he said   yeah  pop  
we d start there   
but then
he grabbed a pencil   
and he drew a line
off the map   
and he said

 off the map 
where no one s been

it s okay  boy 
you re home 
there is a place
in these mountains   
where a new breed
of timber wolf roams   
wiser than man or wolf   
   because of the dog
that runs at the head
of the pack 
now they live without fear   
raise their young 
and flourish 
some say it s just a legend 
not so 
you see  i knew him once   
when he was just a dog
at a man s side 
and even though
this land is his   
every summer   
when he comes down
to the valley   
he remembers kind hands   
and old masters 
before he went to his own   
became his own master 
before he heard   
the call 
i ll follow you anywhere
where you wanna go
yeah  i don t care
let the river drown
all our fears
if the pouring rain
washes you away
i ll go with you  babe
 cause if you fall
i will follow you
into the great unknown
where wild winds blow
if you lose it all
you know i ll be there
when everybody s gone
you re not alone
 cause i ll follow you  oh
where the wild winds blow
so don t you disappear
 cause this road ain t
so lonely when you re near
there s no going
back from here
if your sky turns gray
and you re losing faith
i m with you all the way
 cause if you fall
i will follow you
into the great unknown
where wild winds blow
if you lose it all
you know i ll be there
when everybody s gone
you re not alone
 cause i ll follow you  oh
where the wild winds blow
where the wild winds blow
where the wild winds blow
where the wild winds blow
yeah
 cause if you fall
i will follow you
into the great unknown
where wild winds blow
if you lose it all
you know i ll be there
when everybody s gone
you re not alone
 cause i ll follow you  oh
