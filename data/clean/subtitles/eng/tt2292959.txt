the weekend  private thing 
  he knows everyone 
  cool 
 knows  
who  knows  anyone these days 
more like you hang out
when you re in vegas 
so where did you guys stay
in vegas 
i like the four seasons 
the mandalay 
i like the end of the strip
so i can watch the planes
fly into mccarran 
well  it s good
to finally meet you  man 
it s good to finally  you know 
meet the man in person 
yeah 
no problem 
and hey  i  um 
i really want to thank you
for giving me that role 
i didn t give you that role 
your girlfriend
and the director did 
yeah  but i heard i wasn t
exactly gerald s first choice 
ryan  come on 
don t say that 
no  he s right 
you weren t 
but i went to him and told him
that i m paying for this movie 
so if he doesn t put my
assistant s boyfriend in it 
then i m pullin  out  and
that s when the panic sets in 
panic 
panic set in 
i mean  it s just a low budget
slasher movie  christian 
i don t think people
were panicked by you 
i think  you know  they could
have found the money somehow 
but you made it easier  right 
well  i have to admit  actually
i was a little bit panicked 
fact of the matter is
i m paying for this thing 
i heard from both of you
that he was right for the part 
yeah  indirectly i had something
to do with you getting the role 
but if it wasn t for you
helping out with the casting
and convincing me
that this guy was 
you know  the best one
for the role 
then yeah  you probably
wouldn t have the part 
and we thank you
for the favor 
i think we all made
the right decision 
you know  in the year
that she worked for me 
she never mentioned
having a boyfriend 
that is not true 
i did  too 
you just weren t
paying attention 
really 
you guys look happy though 
yeah  we are 
really happy 
yeah  really are 
and you guys 
how long have you two
been seeing each other 
i told you  baby  a year 
just like us 
yeah 
i like to keep things loose 
though 
i mean  i love her 
god  she s gorgeous 
but it s more fun to keep it
a little complicated 
complicated 
christian  what are you doing 
where are you going with this 
just being transparent  baby 
being transparent
about what 
you know that phone app  amore 
it s kinda like
a girlfriend finder 
yeah    i mean no 
wh what does it do 
it makes    things simple 
certain    assignations 
just really easy 
you know  you get live video 
make sure that people look
exactly the way they do
in their profiles 
assignations for   
what is that 
it means meetings  dude 
oh  okay 
meetings for   
hookups 
you know  girls  couples 
whatever  man 
couples  really 
yes  couples  really 
i guess it s just  well 
i don t know  i m   
i m just a more
conventional guy 
which is why you re with gina 
and i m with tara 
and you don t get jealous 
jealous 
yeah  if there are other
people involved  like guys 
well  it s mostly girls 
and no  i do not get jealous
watching my girl hook up
with another chick 
is this guy   
is this guy for real 
are you for real 
is he serious 
no  no  man 
i mean  i   
look  you re the man  i m   
i i was just trying
to keep up with you 
look  man  it s all about trust 
all right 
i trust her 
she trusts me 
maybe if that trust wasn t
there  i couldn t handle it 
but since it is 
we have a good time 
christian 
i m sitting right here 
what do you mean 
you couldn t handle it 
couldn t handle what 
the fact that i know you love me
makes me trust you 
that makes everything we do
more intense 
i m sorry  christian likes
to shock people 
i get it 
or at least he tries to 
this has nothing to do
with shocking people 
i m just sick of the old school
shit about fucking propriety 
etiquette and all that crap 
you ve been around me
for a year 
it s just fuckin  annoying 
it s like when you re at
your family dinner on sunday 
  and everyone s just lying   
  christian  i want to go 
  can you get the fucking check 
  i ve ordered the check 
it s comin  
it s on its way 
really 
how long does it take 
mm  it s coming though 
don t worry about it 
oh  christian 
before i forget 
i m finalizing all the rooms
for next month 
are you definitely sure
that you re not gonna come 
yeah  there s no way
i m going to new mexico
and watch a bunch of kids
get tortured and killed
by some pissed off ghost
in a warehouse 
besides  i ll be busy
making my own little movies 
what do you mean 
you make your own movies 
on this  dude 
  you get no more sympathy
  don t tell me
where you ve been  
  don t need to know
your sins  
why in the hell did we have
to go to that damn dinner 
gina insisted 
plus i was kinda interested
to see who her new dude is 
what a fuckin  moron 
gina s a smart girl 
you d think she could
get with someone better
than some loser actor 
what do you know about him 
nothing 
i never even thought
this movie would get made 
well  gina worked very hard
to make sure it happened 
i never even read the script 
i told gina if the mexicans or
whoever came up with the cash
that i would just match it 
why aren t you involved
anymore  baby 
why were you ever involved 
my father was on my ass about
doing something with my life 
when i told him i was doing
a movie  he got off my back 
why are you wearing a robe 
guy s almost over here 
what s with all the dudes
lately 
i don t know 
it s a phase 
i like the idea of someone
looking at something
they can t have 
guy thing 
power and control 
but sometimes they do have me 
just those two times 
you didn t seem to mind 
i can t believe you
at dinner tonight 
all that shit that you
were telling them 
is that why you re being
so distant and bitchy  huh 
why do you even fucking care 
it s just my assistant
and some dumb actor 
i don t know 
i guess i d like to keep
some parts of my life private 
some aspects of
my fucking life private 
nobody has a private life
anymore  tara 
okay  what do you talk
to your shrink about 
what do you talk about
when you see dr  campbell 
i don t tell
dr  campbell anything
that i wouldn t tell you 
that s a lie  that s not true 
you just lied to me 
what would you like to know 
i want to know what you
talk to dr  campbell about 
i talk about my family 
i talk about my father trying
to control my fucking life 
what the fuck do you think
i talk to him about 
i don t know 
other girls 
i m more serious about you than
i have been with any other girl 
hope you feel
the same way about me 
christian  there s
a fucking guy coming over 
really 
he s here 
on his way down the driveway 
and i said i hope you
feel the same way about me 
what was with you tonight  hmm 
at dinner 
you were so tense  hmm 
you let him in 
hi  reed  right 
come on in 
i m tara 
this is reed 
what s up  man 
i m christian 
hey  man 
i see you ve met tara 
yeah 
you want something to drink 
shot of tequila 
sure 
she s hot  right 
way hotter than
the pics you sent me 
have a drink 
relax 
be comfy  man 
you wanna see something
better than that 
how does he have
all that money again 
uh  trust fund 
his grandparents own like
half of thousand oaks 
she s beautiful  tara 
don t you think 
she s okay 
don t go there  babe 
i m not doing that with you 
doing what 
that whole  is that girl
prettier than me   thing you do 
i mean  why are you
asking me that 
look  you never even
mentioned her 
you never told me about her
for a year 
you didn t even mention her
by name 
it was just
 christian s girlfriend  
and you really didn t tell me
what a douchebag that guy is 
christ 
the reason i never mentioned her
is that we never really hung out
until she started
helping me with the movie 
why was she even
helping you out 
she was bored 
she needed something to do
besides shopping and fucking 
i mean  jon and i
did most of the work 
but she helped out a little 
i guess 
she did push you
for the part 
i know it was probably a favor
to me and christian 
but without her  i don t know
what would ve happened 
and then after casting 
she just disappeared 
she just stopped coming by
the production office 
i haven t seen her
in like a month 
hey 
thanks 
i told you not to text me 
why can t i text you 
because he looks
at my phone 
why can t we meet
at my place 
that s not gonna happen
anymore 
so that s who you re with 
jesus 
who d you think you were   
so this is the guy
that gave you the mercedes
and has a private jet
and takes you to maui
and lives in the fucking
mansion in malibu 
ryan  please 
last night killed me 
why 
because i finally saw you
with him 
i know you better
than he does 
you re not happy  tara 
who said anything
about happy 
he takes care of me 
and he s in love with me 
it s serious 
fuck it  ryan  who s happy 
who s really happy 
  tell me 
  gina 
  oh  of course 
  gina is  gina s happy 
right  another reason why i
couldn t stand being around her 
and    you really do
all that shit 
couples 
random guys fucking you 
  jesus  tara 
  ryan  stop 
this isn t
going anywhere  okay 
so there s no point
in having this discussion 
this has to end 
we can t do this anymore 
why are you asking me
all this now 
because i hadn t met him before 
and i do care 
i think about you all the time 
i can t help it 
and it makes me sick 
can t get the things he
makes you do out of my mind 
  ryan   
  how do you think i felt
watching him flashing pictures
on his fucking phone
in front of me 
last night made me sick 
it made me fuckin  sick 
we can t do this anymore 
this has gotta end 
what s gotta end  hmm 
what 
fucking me
for the last four weeks 
you wanna end that 
stop  ryan 
you ever tell him about me 
did you ever tell him
that you fell in love with me
three years ago 
that you dumped me
when you realized
i was the guy
who might not make it 
that you essentially
abandoned me
for a bunch
of rich douchebags 
  and now that asshole 
  ryan 
who are you  ryan 
you re still bartending 
you re still working for randall
as a part time assistant
at a fucking hotel 
this dumb little movie s not
going to do anything for you 
  then why push me for it 
  oh  i don t know 
because i care about you
and knew how much you wanted it 
see  that s what
i m saying  baby 
i loved you so much  baby 
we had so much fun together 
i never got over it
when you left 
it killed me  and i tried
so hard to let it go 
i tried so hard
to let go of it 
and just when i think i m
gonna make it without you 
gina suddenly started talking
about her boss s girlfriend 
but this girl she described
didn t sound anything like you 
and then when i saw you
at that audition   
i m still
so in love with you 
i don t fuckin  want to be 
but i am 
i m with him now 
i m with him 
what are you thinking 
you think you re gonna nail
this guy  move in with him 
you think that creep s
gonna marry you 
ryan  don t go there 
it s hard for me  too  okay 
it s hard for me  too 
that s why i tried helping you
with the movie  cause i care 
but you don t have to go and say
things that are gonna hurt me 
  leave him  get out of there 
  and do what 
i don t know  come back to me 
we ll get a job 
  we ll move in together 
  get a job and do what  ryan 
do you not remember how hard
we were busting our asses 
do you remember those days 
no  wait  probably not because
you re still living them 
i m not going back
to that  ryan 
i m not going back
to going on auditions
for jobs i m never gonna get 
for bartending
for 8 bucks a fucking hour 
i m not gonna do it 
do you remember
how hard it was for us 
we were always fucking broke 
we were busting our asses 
we couldn t even pay
the fucking rent  ryan 
we couldn t pay
the fucking rent 
that wasn t fun for me 
i m not going back to that 
and i need someone
to take care of me 
and i needed someone
to take care of me 
  hey 
  hey 
want me to get you
something to drink 
yes  water 
oh  how was your day

two yoga sessions this morning 
and then  oh  i went
to that audition 
you know  the one that
i told you about last time

i definitely didn t get the job 
but whatever 
oh  my god

i just get into it
with you  okay 
i m sorry

what does that mean 
i think you re hot

she was acting really  really
strange at dinner last night 
i couldn t figure out why

in the morning for coffee 
  it s just  she   
  okay 
i mean  how do you know
that she met someone 
  what  did she tell you 
  no 
okay  did   
what  did the guy tell you 
no 
um   
i ve got some stuff

i can t handle this anymore 
need some cash 
no  christian 
i don t need any cash 
just    just get out 
come on  cynthia

i m really sorry that
i didn t congratulate you
on starting
your own pr company 
i mean  that must be
really exciting

it hasn t really taken off 
but you know 
if it wasn t for christian
i d never have been able
to start it 
yeah  christian can be
very helpful that way 
so dinner was fun
last night 
i m sorry if i  you know 
seemed out of it and such 
i was just really
preoccupied with things 
i know how christian gets 
and i have to say that ryan
was a little shocked by him 
but he really liked him 
he thought he was a great guy 
oh  really  he did 
yeah 
thought he was really cool 
you know  good guys are really
hard to come by these days 
  so you re a very lucky girl 
  tell me about it 
i can t believe i actually
found someone so genuine 
he s a great guy 
look  this was nice 
i just  um   
i m sorry  i just wanted

to see a movie in the theater 
a movie that you really thought
meant something to you 
we went to the premiere
last week

premieres don t really count 
i don t know  you know 
i guess maybe it s just
not my thing anymore 
and plus i don t wanna be
away from christian
for that long  i guess 
i get it 
i totally get it 
i wouldn t want to be away
from ryan for that long either 
no  it s just 
at the time i was bored 
and i needed
something to do 
and so that s why
i got involved  and   
you know  now i m looking for
something else to do  so

oh   
hey  christian 
no girls allowed 
hey  christian 
what s that 
going over effects
the budget will allow 
even though my boyfriend
is the effects supervisor 
he s not doing this for free 
so we have to pick and choose 
that little bitch 
i wanna talk to you
about something 
yep 
what is it 
ryan 
ryan 
another topic my boyfriend
loves to hate 
really  why s that 
every movie i ve produced 
he thinks i m trying
to bang the leading man 
and  uh  half the time 
he s been wrong 
i want you to call ryan in
tomorrow 
tell him he s been replaced 
what  why 
what happened 
what s gerald s problem 
this has nothing
to do with gerald 
and ryan s not actually
being replaced 
i don t get it 
just call ryan in
and tell him
that gerald s thinking of
taking him out of the movie 
and you  jon 
can convince him otherwise
if ryan s willing
to do something for you 
like what 
tell him he gets to keep
the part if he sleeps with you 
why the hell
would i do that 
favor to me 
you re not joking  huh 
no  i am not 
christian 
i m friends with gina 
ryan is totally straight 
really 
you think
he s totally straight 
that s what i believe  yeah 
so how did he get the job
at the hotel  huh 
 cause he s so straight
or  cause he s so  um  smart 
christian  i m best friends
with gina 
and i can t do this to her 
jon  jon  jon 
relax 
it s just a prank 
test ryan 
see what his reaction is 
afterwards  you can tell him
it s a joke 
and if he has the balls
to go to gina
and tell her about
your little prank 
then just say 
 christian put me up to it  
blame it on me 
i ll take full responsibility 
chris  i don t think
i can do this 
jon  there are a lot
of people in this town
who call themselves
producers 
you re just one 
okay 
okay 
but i still don t get it 
you don t need to 
besides  you might get lucky 
hey  tara 
baby 
  ain t got my gun
  but i got conviction
  and i got no one to share
  in my addiction
hi 
what d you do today 
  i went to the gym 
  which gym 
equinox 
the gym that i m a member of 
the one on westwood
or the one on sunset 
the one in west hollywood 
why d you go to the one
in west hollywood 
because it was closer to where
i was meeting gina for lunch 
what time did you
go to the gym 
tell me something 
do you find gina attractive 
no  i d never hire an assistant
i find attractive 
why not 
she s a pretty girl 
do you find ryan attractive 
okay  here we go 
no  i don t 
well  i figured you have to find
him attractive on some level 
you cast him as the lead
in the movie 
no  no  that s not true 
i did not cast him
in the movie 
all right  you made me cast him
as the lead in the movie 
no  we ve been over this 
i didn t make you do anything 
you hired him
as a favor to gina 
and that s why
he s in the movie  isn t it 
would you fuck him 
what did you just
fucking ask me 
i said
would    you    fuck    him 
no    i    wouldn t 
did actors in the past 
and i have two words for them 
never again 
i just thought maybe
you two knew each other 
maybe you met before 
when  when would we have
met before 
please  enlighten me 
maybe your modeling days
when you first got to la 
oh  god  no 
i hadn t  christian 
but you know  who knows 
i was pretty wasted
during those days 
so anything s possible  right 
come on 
christian  why are you
asking me these things 
no reason  you re the one
getting all defensive 
i m chill  baby 
why are you asking me
about ryan 
i just thought maybe
the two of you had met before 
no  nope 
we had not 
we had not met before 
i m gonna get another 
you want one 
yeah 
after that interrogation 
give me a fucking double 
how was your day 
did you go to the gym today 
  ain t got my gun
  but i got conviction
  and i got no one to share
  in my addiction
  smiling  keeping pace
  with the devil s prediction
hey  babe 
  hey  babe 
  how d it go 
uh  i don t think i got it 
too many other guys 
i m sorry  babe 
what are you doing 
christian does yoga
with cynthia gray 
what 
i m just looking
at his schedule 
do you know her 
yeah  actually  i was
in an acting class with her
a few years ago 
weird to see
her name again 
so she s teaching yoga now 
typical 
right  that s exactly
what christian s doing
when he s over with cynthia 
it s yoga  sure 
so i had lunch
with tara today 
  you did 
  yeah 
you okay 
yeah  yeah  i just   
i don t know  i guess
i m a little surprised
after what you told me
about her last night 
yeah  i know  but christian
asked me to go  so   
  why 
  i don t know 
it was like he wanted me
to find out something 
  like what 
  i really don t know 
afterwards  it just confirmed
everything he already knew 
which is that she doesn t
wanna have anything more
to do with the movie 
what else did she say 
well  i don t think
she believed me
when i told her you thought
christian was cool 
  why would you tell her that 
  huh 
that    why would you say that
i thought christian was cool 
what does it matter  you don t
care that i said that  right 
ryan

  not another second to lose
  you just walk away
  you see it s gone
  not an other second to live
  and you hear my voice
  and now it s gone
  whatever happened
to our love  
  it seems so strange to me
that you re running away  
  and when i think
of what i ve done  
  and it s not strange to me
that you re running away  
  it s a fear
  so  you remember me 
  no  i don t 
yeah  i used to date christian 
you know  before i met you 
  great 
  you don t seem surprised 
honestly  i don t really care
who christian dated 
and why would i be surprised 
christian went out with
a lot of girls before me 
and i don t care 
well  i would 
i would care 
cynthia   
really don t have a clue 
do you 
you don t know anything about me
and christian  do you 
all right  you know what 
lay it out  babe 
what kind of trouble am i in 
tara  you know 
i have enough of a clue
to get into contact with you 
okay  because i think  you need
to get out of this relationship 
i think you need
to get away from him 
really 
why 
because he s sick 
he s a sick little boy 
go on 
i mean  even though he was 
you know  fucking other girls 
there were  of course  the
hookups that we did together 
i never wanted to 
i mean  he   
always pressured me into them 
really 
you didn t want to 
i m assuming he does
the same thing with you 
just finish your fucking story 
cynthia 
i need to get the hell
outta here 
not really a story  no 
just that moment when everything
became clarified for me 
you know  one night
when things got out of hand 
how 
i found myself
in the emergency room at ucla 
hmm  how did that happen 
christian decided to invite a
bunch of guys over to the house 
and you let him 
no 
actually  i didn t 
i was passed out 
and who s fault was that 
cynthia  hmm 
your precious christian
decided to crush up
a bunch of rufelin in a drink
that he gave me 
i never called him  precious  
first of all 
i believe that was your name 
secondly  it s  rohypnol  
  third of all   
  you know what i meant 
i don t believe you 
really 
you don t 
so what are you saying  cynthia 
what are you saying 
you saying that you didn t
let yourself get gang banged 
  that you had no control   
  he filmed the entire thing 
and then he threatened
to put it up on different sites
if i said anything
to anybody 
obviously you weren t in control
of christian  i am 
i m telling you this because
i think he s gonna hurt you
in the same way 
no  you re telling me this
because you re jealous
and a little drunk 
god  it s such
a girl thing to do 
look  christian s
not gonna hurt me 
if anything  i m the one
that s gonna hurt him 
she s on her way back

with him to look at it 
bla bla bla 
and privacy block is on 
photos locked

dr  campbell s a shrink

ryan  i told you  you don t

the movie s

i really don t know what
you re talking about right now 
  the movie s not   
  the movie s happening 
the movie s not gonna happen 
ryan  what did   
okay  stop  what did jon   
it s not jon 
it s not gerald 
it s not you  it s him 
it s christian 
he s not gonna
let the movie happen 
  you need to calm down 
  he s gonna pull out 
  he s gonna fuckin  pull out 
  what are you talking about 
i don t understand 
what  i don t understand 
it s not gonna happen because
i ve been fucking his girlfriend
for the last month 
it s not gonna happen because   
i m in love with her 
that s why tara stopped
working on the movie 
i never told you this  but
we lived together for a year 
me and tara 
she dumped me when she started
hooking up with christian 
i hadn t seen her
in three years
until that day i walked
into the audition room 
and then it started again 
and christian found out 
he s had me followed 
he s fucked with
my bank account 
he s insane  and he knows
about me and tara 
that s why the movie s not
gonna happen  okay  got it 
i love you  baby 
you believed in me 
you helped me so much 
but i    i can t control it 
how i feel about her 
but she ll never be with you 
she s not going back to that 
we can talk about this
as much as you want 
i ll spend all day
talking about this 
and then i want you
out of here 
i want you to take
all your things 
and i want you out of here 
and then i m going
to beg christian
to keep the movie going 
i don t care how much
i have to degrade myself 
i will beg him
to keep the movie going 
and i will make sure
that you are not
within a hundred miles
of that set
for the duration
of the shoot 
usually i m the one
in control 
last night i wasn t 
none of it seemed real 
not when that guy
was sucking my dick
or when tara tried
to get him to fuck me 
which didn t happen  fyi 
there were certain things
that tara and the other girl
wanted us to do 
and i don t even know
why i care 
just some dumb kids on the
internet i ll never see again 
just   
didn t feel like
i wasn t in control 
i felt objectified 
the way the two of them
just watched
and told us what to do 
doesn t usually go down
like that 
usually i m the one
directing the scene 
it made me feel
like an actor 
it s kinda like
how i feel when i m here 
you feel like an actor
when you are here 
we re all actors  aren t we 
i mean   
we all act differently 
depending on the situation
we re in or we re around 
i don t act the same way with
you as i do when i m with tara 
just last night and here   
were pronounced 
that    disconnect 
so do you worry about being
an actor when you re here 
it doesn t worry me 
i just don t like it 
i don t like to feel
like i m not in control 
have you processed that
coming here is non negotiable 
that it s mandatory 
have you been able
to accept that 
you mean
have i processed it 
i processed it 
i ve accepted it 
i just don t like it 
every day i think
what ll happen
if i don t go back to
dr  campbell s next week 
this thought
is always on my mind 
and the answer is 
if i miss a session 
you will call the asshole 
  the asshole being   
  my father 
and if i told your father
you re missing sessions 
then the asshole will pull my
trust fund if i miss a session 
what are you thinking 
i m thinking have i been here
long enough yet 
and the answer is 
yeah  it s me 
you there 
i got your little message 
ryan  ryan  ryan 
poor  poor ryan 
it all seemed so exciting
when you were 18 
and that photographer found you 
class trip from michigan 
all the way out to los angeles 
yeah  hollywood 
and you were suddenly
so far away
from that shithole town
you grew up in 
so you did
some modeling shoots 
everyone was so encouraging 
you even did
a commercial or two 
i saw one on youtube
for pringles 
looked like a fucking moron 
then what  huh 
nothing 
nada 
so now you re bartending with
the occasional hotel gig
to supplement your income 
that s just  cause randall
wants to fuck you up the ass 
who knows 
you d probably let him 
he probably has 
what happened last october
at the post ranch inn  huh 
you tell gina about that 
i doubt you told gina
about that romantic drive
all the way up the coast
to the post ranch inn 
and then bam 
you reconnect with tara
last july 
and then bam 
she convinces everyone
to cast you in a movie
you re not even capable
of acting in 
and then bam 
you re fucking my girlfriend 
and bam 
you convince cynthia to tell
everyone some bullshit story 
so what  huh 
you get tara to dump me 
so you guys can 
what  run away together 
get married 
so you can  what 
coexist in some
dump of a house somewhere 
think tara s going back
to that kind of life 
you think she s going
to that lifestyle again 
you want my advice  ryan 
go back to michigan
and get over it 
you clueless
little motherfucker 
what are you doing here 
i just wanted
to talk to you 
why

time that we broke up  yeah

they had some suspects 
but aside from that  no 
at the end  nothing 
didn t they find like a knife in

whoever killed
the person  her 
must have thrown it
in his car
