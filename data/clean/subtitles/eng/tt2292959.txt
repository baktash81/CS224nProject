the weekend private thing
he knows everyone
cool
knows
who knows anyone these days
more like you hang out
when youre in vegas
so where did you guys stay
in vegas
i like the four seasons
the mandalay
i like the end of the strip
so i can watch the planes
fly into mccarran
well its good
to finally meet you man
its good to finally you know
meet the man in person
yeah
no problem
and hey i um
i really want to thank you
for giving me that role
i didnt give you that role
your girlfriend
and the director did
yeah but i heard i wasnt
exactly geralds first choice
ryan come on
dont say that
no hes right
you werent
but i went to him and told him
that im paying for this movie
so if he doesnt put my
assistants boyfriend in it
then im pullin out and
thats when the panic sets in
panic
panic set in
i mean its just a lowbudget
slasher movie christian
i dont think people
were panicked by you
i think you know they could
have found the money somehow
but you made it easier right
well i have to admit actually
i was a little bit panicked
fact of the matter is
im paying for this thing
i heard from both of you
that he was right for the part
yeah indirectly i had something
to do with you getting the role
but if it wasnt for you
helping out with the casting
and convincing me
that this guy was
you know the best one
for the role
then yeah you probably
wouldnt have the part
and we thank you
for the favor
i think we all made
the right decision
you know in the year
that she worked for me
she never mentioned
having a boyfriend
that is not true
i did too
you just werent
paying attention
really
you guys look happy though
yeah we are
really happy
yeah really are
and you guys
how long have you two
been seeing each other
i told you baby a year
just like us
yeah
i like to keep things loose
though
i mean i love her
god shes gorgeous
but its more fun to keep it
a little complicated
complicated
christian what are you doing
where are you going with this
just being transparent baby
being transparent
about what
you know that phone app amore
its kinda like
a girlfriend finder
yeah i mean no
whwhat does it do
it makes things simple
certain assignations
just really easy
you know you get live video
make sure that people look
exactly the way they do
in their profiles
assignations for
what is that
it means meetings dude
oh okay
meetings for
hookups
you know girls couples
whatever man
couples really
yes couples really
i guess its just well
i dont know im
im just a more
conventional guy
which is why youre with gina
and im with tara
and you dont get jealous
jealous
yeah if there are other
people involved like guys
well its mostly girls
and no i do not get jealous
watching my girl hook up
with another chick
is this guy
is this guy for real
are you for real
is he serious
no no man
i mean i
look youre the man im
ii was just trying
to keep up with you
look man its all about trust
all right
i trust her
she trusts me
maybe if that trust wasnt
there i couldnt handle it
but since it is
we have a good time
christian
im sitting right here
what do you mean
you couldnt handle it
couldnt handle what
the fact that i know you love me
makes me trust you
that makes everything we do
more intense
im sorry christian likes
to shock people
i get it
or at least he tries to
this has nothing to do
with shocking people
im just sick of the old school
shit about fucking propriety
etiquette and all that crap
youve been around me
for a year
its just fuckin annoying
its like when youre at
your family dinner on sunday
and everyones just lying
christian i want to go
can you get the fucking check
ive ordered the check
its comin
its on its way
really
how long does it take
mm its coming though
dont worry about it
oh christian
before i forget
im finalizing all the rooms
for next month
are you definitely sure
that youre not gonna come
yeah theres no way
im going to new mexico
and watch a bunch of kids
get tortured and killed
by some pissedoff ghost
in a warehouse
besides ill be busy
making my own little movies
what do you mean
you make your own movies
on this dude
you get no more sympathy
dont tell me
where youve been
dont need to know
your sins
why in the hell did we have
to go to that damn dinner
gina insisted
plus i was kinda interested
to see who her new dude is
what a fuckin moron
ginas a smart girl
youd think she could
get with someone better
than some loser actor
what do you know about him
nothing
i never even thought
this movie would get made
well gina worked very hard
to make sure it happened
i never even read the script
i told gina if the mexicans or
whoever came up with the cash
that i would just match it
why arent you involved
anymore baby
why were you ever involved
my father was on my ass about
doing something with my life
when i told him i was doing
a movie he got off my back
why are you wearing a robe
guys almost over here
whats with all the dudes
lately
i dont know
its a phase
i like the idea of someone
looking at something
they cant have
guy thing
power and control
but sometimes they do have me
just those two times
you didnt seem to mind
i cant believe you
at dinner tonight
all that shit that you
were telling them
is that why youre being
so distant and bitchy huh
why do you even fucking care
its just my assistant
and some dumb actor
i dont know
i guess id like to keep
some parts of my life private
some aspects of
my fucking life private
nobody has a private life
anymore tara
okay what do you talk
to your shrink about
what do you talk about
when you see dr campbell
i dont tell
dr campbell anything
that i wouldnt tell you
thats a lie thats not true
you just lied to me
what would you like to know
i want to know what you
talk to dr campbell about
i talk about my family
i talk about my father trying
to control my fucking life
what the fuck do you think
i talk to him about
i dont know
other girls
im more serious about you than
i have been with any other girl
hope you feel
the same way about me
christian theres
a fucking guy coming over
really
hes here
on his way down the driveway
and i said i hope you
feel the same way about me
what was with you tonight hmm
at dinner
you were so tense hmm
you let him in
hi reed right
come on in
im tara
this is reed
whats up man
im christian
hey man
i see youve met tara
yeah
you want something to drink
shot of tequila
sure
shes hot right
way hotter than
the pics you sent me
have a drink
relax
be comfy man
you wanna see something
better than that
how does he have
all that money again
uh trust fund
his grandparents own like
half of thousand oaks
shes beautiful tara
dont you think
shes okay
dont go there babe
im not doing that with you
doing what
that whole is that girl
prettier than me thing you do
i mean why are you
asking me that
look you never even
mentioned her
you never told me about her
for a year
you didnt even mention her
by name
it was just
christians girlfriend
and you really didnt tell me
what a douchebag that guy is
christ
the reason i never mentioned her
is that we never really hung out
until she started
helping me with the movie
why was she even
helping you out
she was bored
she needed something to do
besides shopping and fucking
i mean jon and i
did most of the work
but she helped out a little
i guess
she did push you
for the part
i know it was probably a favor
to me and christian
but without her i dont know
what wouldve happened
and then after casting
she just disappeared
she just stopped coming by
the production office
i havent seen her
in like a month
hey
thanks
i told you not to text me
why cant i text you
because he looks
at my phone
why cant we meet
at my place
thats not gonna happen
anymore
so thats who youre with
jesus
whod you think you were
so this is the guy
that gave you the mercedes
and has a private jet
and takes you to maui
and lives in the fucking
mansion in malibu
ryan please
last night killed me
why
because i finally saw you
with him
i know you better
than he does
youre not happy tara
who said anything
about happy
he takes care of me
and hes in love with me
its serious
fuck it ryan whos happy
whos really happy
tell me
gina
oh of course
gina is ginas happy
right another reason why i
couldnt stand being around her
and you really do
all that shit
couples
random guys fucking you
jesus tara
ryan stop
this isnt
going anywhere okay
so theres no point
in having this discussion
this has to end
we cant do this anymore
why are you asking me
all this now
because i hadnt met him before
and i do care
i think about you all the time
i cant help it
and it makes me sick
cant get the things he
makes you do out of my mind
ryan
how do you think i felt
watching him flashing pictures
on his fucking phone
in front of me
last night made me sick
it made me fuckin sick
we cant do this anymore
this has gotta end
whats gotta end hmm
what
fucking me
for the last four weeks
you wanna end that
stop ryan
you ever tell him about me
did you ever tell him
that you fell in love with me
three years ago
that you dumped me
when you realized
i was the guy
who might not make it
that you essentially
abandoned me
for a bunch
of rich douchebags
and now that asshole
ryan

im saying baby
i loved you so much baby
we had so much fun together
i never got over it
when you left
it killed me and i tried
so hard to let it go
i tried so hard
to let go of it
and just when i think im
gonna make it without you
gina suddenly started talking
about her bosss girlfriend
but this girl she described
didnt sound anything like you
and then when i saw you
at that audition

so in love with you
i dont fuckin want to be

it seems so strange to me
that youre running away
and when i think
of what ive done
and its not strange to me
that youre running away
its a fear
so you remember me
no i dont
yeah i used to date christian
you know before i met you
great
you dont seem surprised
honestly i dont really care
who christian dated
and why would i be surprised
christian went out with
a lot of girls before me
and i dont care
well i would
i would care
cynthia
really dont have a clue
do you
you dont know anything about me
and christian do you
all right you know what
lay it out babe
what kind of trouble am i in
tara you know
i have enough of a clue
to get into contact with you
okay because i think you need
to get out of this relationship
i think you need
to get away from him
really
why
because hes sick
hes a sick little boy
go on
i mean even though he was
you know fucking other girls
there were of course the
hookups that we did together
i never wanted to
i mean he
always pressured me into them
really
you didnt want to
im assuming he does
the same thing with you
just finish your fucking story
cynthia
i need to get the hell
outta here
not really a story no
just that moment when everything
became clarified for me
you know one night
when things got out of hand
how
i found myself
in the emergency room at ucla
hmm how did that happen
christian decided to invite a
bunch of guys over to the house
and you let him
no
actually i didnt
i was passed out
and whos fault was that
cynthia hmm
your precious christian
decided to crush up
a bunch of rufelin in a drink
that he gave me
i never called him precious
first of all
i believe that was your name
secondly its rohypnol
third of all
you know what i meant
i dont believe you
really
you dont
so what are you saying cynthia
what are you saying
you saying that you didnt
let yourself get gang banged
that you had no control
he filmed the entire thing
and then he threatened
to put it up on different sites
if i said anything
to anybody
obviously you werent in control
of christian i am
im telling you this because
i think hes gonna hurt you
in the same way
no youre telling me this
because youre jealous
and a little drunk
god its such
a girlthing to do
look christians
not gonna hurt me
if anything im the one
thats gonna hurt him
shes on her way back

what are you talking about
i dont understand
what i dont understand
its not gonna happen because
ive been fucking his girlfriend
for the last month
its not gonna happen because
im in love with her
thats why tara stopped
working on the movie
i never told you this but
we lived together for a year
me and tara
she dumped me when she started
hooking up with christian
i hadnt seen her
in three years
until that day i walked
into the audition room
and then it started again
and christian found out
hes had me followed
hes fucked with
my bank account
hes insane and he knows
about me and tara
thats why the movies not
gonna happen okay got it
i love you baby
you believed in me
you helped me so much
but i i cant control it
how i feel about her
but shell never be with you
shes not going back to that
we can talk about this
as much as you want
ill spend all day
talking about this
and then i want you
out of here
i want you to take
all your things
and i want you out of here
and then im going
to beg christian
to keep the movie going
i dont care how much
i have to degrade myself
i will beg him
to keep the movie going
and i will make sure
that you are not
within a hundred miles
of that set
for the duration
of the shoot
usually im the one
in control
last night i wasnt
none of it seemed real
not when that guy
was sucking my dick
or when tara tried
to get him to fuck me
which didnt happen fyi
there were certain things
that tara and the other girl
wanted us to do
and i dont even know
why i care
just some dumb kids on the
internet ill never see again
just
didnt feel like
i wasnt in control
i felt objectified
the way the two of them
just watched
and told us what to do
doesnt usually go down
like that
usually im the one
directing the scene
it made me feel
like an actor
its kinda like
how i feel when im here
you feel like an actor
when you are here
were all actors arent we
i mean
we all act differently
depending on the situation
were in or were around
i dont act the same way with
you as i do when im with tara
just last night and here
were pronounced
that disconnect
so do you worry about being
an actor when youre here
it doesnt worry me
i just dont like it
i dont like to feel
like im not in control
have you processed that
coming here is nonnegotiable
that its mandatory
have you been able
to accept that
you mean
have i processed it
i processed it
ive accepted it
i just dont like it
every day i think
whatll happen
if i dont go back to
dr campbells next week
this thought
is always on my mind
and the answer is
if i miss a session
you will call the asshole
the asshole being
my father
and if i told your father
youre missing sessions
then the asshole will pull my
trust fund if i miss a session
what are you thinking
im thinking have i been here
long enough yet
and the answer is
yeah its me
you there
i got your little message
ryan ryan ryan
poor poor ryan
it all seemed so exciting
when you were 18
and that photographer found you
class trip from michigan
all the way out to los angeles
yeah hollywood
and you were suddenly
so far away
from that shithole town
you grew up in
so you did
some modeling shoots
everyone was so encouraging
you even did
a commercial or two
i saw one on youtube
for pringles
looked like a fucking moron
then what huh
nothing
nada
so now youre bartending with
the occasional hotel gig
to supplement your income
thats just cause randall
wants to fuck you up the ass
who knows
youd probably let him
he probably has
what happened last october
at the post ranch inn huh
you tell gina about that
i doubt you told gina
about that romantic drive
all the way up the coast
to the post ranch inn
and then bam
you reconnect with tara
last july
and then bam
she convinces everyone
to cast you in a movie
youre not even capable
of acting in
and then bam
youre fucking my girlfriend
and bam
you convince cynthia to tell
everyone some bullshit story
so what huh
you get tara to dump me
so you guys can
what run away together
get married
so you can what
coexist in some
dump of a house somewhere
think taras going back
to that kind of life
you think shes going
to that lifestyle again
you want my advice ryan
