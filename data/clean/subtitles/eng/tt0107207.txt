all rise 
sir michael hagerty will present
the case on behalf of the crown 
there are two series of charges here 
ladies and gentlemen 
the four defendants in front   
are charged with 11 counts in relation
to the explosion of the guildford pub   
and the murders of five people 
the crown will show
that these were the bombers 
the seven defendants behind   
are charged with the possession
of explosives  not charged with murder 
the crown s case
against them is   
that they are a support network
for the bombers  and as such   
  should be considered independent 
  control yourself  pay attention 
my first witness is
inspector robert dixon 
i swear by almighty god that the
evidence i give shall be the truth   
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth 
inspector  why do you believe
these four are the bombers 
first hill  then conlon 
armstrong  richardson   
confessed to the bombing 
they are the ira s asu 
can you explain asus for us 
active service unit 
they are the elite of the ira   
who carry out
the bombings and the shootings 
often they are combat veterans with
experience of shooting at soldiers   
and planting explosives 
and the others  
annie maguire and her family 
they are the ira s support network 
their families and friends store
the weapons and explosives   
and they provide
what we call  safe houses  
thank you  inspector 
these people were arrested
two days   
after the prevention
of terrorism act was introduced 
that s correct 
can you explain  please  the powers
that this gives to the police 
it permits us to hold
suspected terrorists   
for a period of up to seven days 
quite extraordinary powers
in a democracy 
quite difficult  i would think for
the police to resist the temptation   
  to deal forcibly with people 
  objection 
people they suspect of the biggest
bombing campaign on british mainland   
  since the second world war 
  objection  my lord  i really must  
  get to the point 
  now  this bombing campaign   
struck deep into the british people s
sense of security 
the people looked to you 
inspector  to find those responsible 
yes 
you must have been under
the most intense pressure 
that s my job 
now  all of the defendants claim  
including young patrick maguire 
aged just 14  
patrick 
would you stand up  please 
thank you 
all of the defendants claim   
that they were subjected to physical and
mental abuse while in police custody 
they were never harmed
in any way 
he s fucking lying 
they beat the shite out of us 
silence 
please believe us 
they beat us 
just be quiet 
sit them down 
silence in the court 
mr conlon says   
that you pulled him by the hair
and squeezed his testicles 
i never even spoke to mr conlon 
i hope you burn in hell  dixon 
silence 
mr hill says the police sat astride him
and put a gun in his mouth 
there was no pressure of any kind 
you can go and fuck yourself 
you lying fucking bastard 
order  order in court 
inspector  in the case
of the four main defendants   
you have no corroborating evidence
of any kind 
i have the confessions of four obvious
terrorists  what more do you want 
well  nitroglycerine
is a highly toxic substance 
it s when the substance
to be tested  
after a few weeks 
we were bored out of our minds  
just messed around
and that there 
they must ve been
desperate for evidence 
they produced annie s washing up gloves
like a rabbit out of a hat at one point 
then it was my turn
to take the stand 
mr conlon 
did you bomb guildford 
no  i didn t 
the police claim that you were in
guildford on the night of the bombing 
can you tell us where you were 
i was in a park in london
at that time 
  who with 
  with paul hill sitting there 
you met somebody else that night 
about 8 00 p m 
  aye  i met a man called charlie burke 
  and who is he 
he was just a fellow 
a homeless guy that we met in the park 
why do you remember
this man so clearly 
i was thinking that if i didn t get out
of london fast  i would end up like him 
  you told this to the police 
  aye 
  what did they say 
  they said he didn t exist 
mr conlon  why did you confess
to the guildford bombing 
they beat me   
and then they threatened
to kill my father 
  will you repeat that please 
  they terrorized me for seven days 
after that 
they threatened to kill my father 
i d have fucking signed anything
after that 
  excuse my language 
  thank you 
you expect this jury to believe
that decorated police officers   
would risk their career
and their reputation   
by threatening your father 
i don t expect them to believe it
by the time you finish with them   
but it happens to be truth 
you re an honest man 
aren t you  mr conlon 
i like to think so 
you ve told us you remember
this charlie burke very well 
aye 
do you remember telling the police
anything else about that night 
let me refresh your memory 
you told inspector dixon   
that you had committed
a robbery on that night 
now do you remember 
aye 
  who did you rob 
  robbed a hooker 
  you robbed a prostitute 
  aye 
and we are expected to believe a man
who claims he stole from a prostitute   
before we would believe ten police
officers who stood here on oath   
and called you a liar 
that was the truth 
i m bound to say i don t find
you very convincing 
thank you  mr conlon 
why didn t you tell me
that you d stole from that woman 
you should ve called me 
i would ve sent the money 
are you gonna be a thief
and a liar all your life 
standing up in that witness box 
making faces to your mates 
at least you told the truth
in there  that ll stand you 
are you not going
to eat that sausage 
they put a gun in my mouth   
and made me confess
to a murder i didn t commit 
so i said i did the big bombing   
and named anybody i knew
who was not in the ira 
not in the ira 
  definitely not in the ira 
  why 
you know why 
i just wanted to show
how ridiculous it all was 
inspector  the defendant conlon
presented an alibi  
one charlie burke 
that name did appear in mr conlon s
statement  we investigated it 
we couldn t find any trace
of such a person 
and there was this question
of the robbery of a prostitute 
no robberies were reported
in that area that night 
at the start of this trial 
i shook gerry conlon s hand 
subsequently  i was deeply shocked
when a fellow attorney came to me   
and asked me if i was now
going to wash my hand 
in my long legal career 
i cannot remember a case   
where emotions have
been so charged 
it falls to me now
to appeal to you   
the members of the jury 
not to get caught up in this   
tide of mass hysteria 
inspector dixon admits there are scores
of inconsistencies in the confessions 
my clients contend that
they were forced to confess   
through brutality
and intimidation 
now  they may be foolish   
petty thieves 
even drug abusers   
but they are not the ruthless bombers
who have terrorized britain for months 
you should find these young people
not guilty 
  bollocks 
  okay  let s go 
  get your fucking hands off me 
  move it 
  move it 
  hands off 
ladies and gentlemen   
like my learned colleague
in the defence   
i would caution you not
to be swayed by your emotions 
the four people
you see in the front   
are one of the most cunning and
cruel criminal conspiracies   
ever to set foot on english soil 
now  here are the facts
of this case 
inspector dixon   
a decorated officer
of great expertise   
acting on reliable information
and good detective work   
arrested paul hill   
who  guilt ridden by the shame
of his crime  confessed 
that confession led the police
to the ringleader  conlon   
and his terrorist family  
his aunt  annie maguire 
the experienced bomb maker   
who wore rubber gloves
when handling explosives   
in the kitchen
of her home in harlesden 
she even allowed her children
to handle explosives  
vincent  aged 16 
patrick  14  
who did not   could not  
know any better 
giuseppe conlon 
her brother in law   
the courier who arrived
with more explosives 
armstrong and his dupe
richardson  who carried the bomb 
now  these are the people who 
in a panic   
had to dispose
of the nitroglycerine   
and that is what sealed
their fate 
how do we know this 
because the truth was on their hands 
it is a story written
in the blood of their victims 
you have seen some of those
who survived   
their callous disregard
for human life 
it is now your duty
to protect society from them 
i am confident that
that is what you will do 
have you reached a verdict 
yes  we have  my lord 
  how do you find the defendants 
  guilty as charged 
hang the irie bastards 
order  silence 
string  em up 
gerard patrick conlon 
stand up 
i feel it is my duty
to wonder aloud   
why you were not charged
with treason to the crown   
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging  
a sentence i would have had
no difficulty in passing   
in this case 
i sentence you
to life imprisonment   
and i instruct
that you shall serve   
a minimum of 30 years 
take him down 
help me 
paul michael hill 
in my view  your crime
is such that   
life shall mean life 
annie maguire 
i recommend you serve 14 years 
  what have i done  for christ s sake 
  take her down 
  giuseppe conlon  12 years 
  no  my husband s innocent 
lord have mercy on you 
patrick joseph armstrong 
30 years 
carole richardson 
30 years 
our case was so insane that if you
made it up  nobody would believe it 
look  gareth  i know people say
that i m a compulsive storyteller   
and nobody believed
a word i said in court   
but charlie burke did exist   he s not
just a figment of my imagination 
sorry

to park royal prison

most dangerous criminals were held   
in the maximum security wing

you couldn t make it to the top   
and i hopped off and looked back 
and your face was all red 
  remember that 
  aye 
it was working in the paint shed
done that to you

it was the fumes from working
in the paint shed done that to you

i m going back to belfast 
after the fight  nobody stopped us
going out in the yard to exercise 
i felt brilliant 
joe explained things to me 
he explained how the brits
never left anywhere without a fight   
how they had to be beaten out of
every country they ever occupied   
how this prison was just
an extension of their system 
calling for work
on the threes 
we had to confront the chief
prison officer  barker 
mr smalls 
but to do that 
we had to take care of ronnie smalls 
can i have a word
about 54 halsley road

paddy s all right 
soon  we were all
one happy family 
again 
even kojak was ready to forgive 
  live and let live 
  barker began to panic 
he told us to take our socks
out of the window 
he thought we were signalling
to other prisoners 
we re not signalling 
we re drying our socks out 
  take the socks out of the window 
  who says 
mr barker 
  that was all the excusejoe needed 
  give us two minutes 
  up and away we went 
  are you with me 
what s he up to now 
all prison officers

this ll damage the whole campaign 
look  you do it your way 
and we ll do it ours  all right 
  you can read our demands 
  go back to your cells 
blankets 
  for god s sake  put a stop to this 
  you re weakening my position 
  it will end in violence

when i was a wee lad  i used to wonder
what you were doing under the towel 
one day when you and ma were out 
i got a big bowl of boiling water   
whacked a big drop of vick
and put the towel over my head 
i sat there trying to figure out what it
was about  cause nothing was happening 
i figured you

for five years now 
as if i never left your mother 
what i remember most
about my childhood is   
holding your hand 
my wee hand in your big hand 
and the smell of tobacco 
i remember that   
i could smell the tobacco
off the palm of your hand

out of the english dictionary 
they fouled the ball  gareth 
they fouled the fucking ball 
and they re as guilty as sin 
believe me  if there s one thing
i know about  it s guilt 
keep looking  em in the eye 
and it s gonna reveal itself 
you have to keep up the pressure 
do what you have to do 
free the four 
free the four 
those were meant to be here
three weeks ago 
 the parade of innocence  
what do you think 
thousands of people
lined the streets of dublin   
london and liverpool today
in demonstrations   
demanding the release
of the guildford four 
  questions have been raised  
  say good night to daddy 
  good night  dad 
  good night  son 
free the four 
free the four 
this was a mistake 
why don t we let her
see the files 
what harm could it do 
  mr dixon 
  yes 
don t you get tired of this 
this is a court order that i be allowed
to see the giuseppe conlon case files 
  good morning 
  there are a few rules to be observed 
here s a complete list of
the conlon  giuseppe case files   
the only files you ll need to see 
i ll go to the file drawer
and bring it out 
you take a page at a time 
read it and then return it 
sorry  is there a problem 
mr dixon 
problem 
not at all  mrs peirce 
our chief archivist  mr jenkins 
is here to assist you 
if you want to make a photocopy 
i alone will do it 
use this pen at all times
for any notes 
if you deface any document  we can
trace it through the ink in this pen 
there are national security issues
involved here  mrs peirce 
we wouldn t want
police intelligence files   
leaked to the ira now  would we 
conlon  giuseppe file 
yes  sir 
leave my kit on the bus 
 cause i m not staying in your jail 
so  our new vip prisoner 
welcome to scotland 
i m an innocent man 
my father was an innocent man 
he died in one of your jails 
there s nothing you can do to hurt me 
they ve moved me to a scottish
jail to break my confidence 
  put him in solitary 
  this is a peaceful protest 
we ll teach you manners 
better men than you
have tried that already 
i have not seen my client
for two months 
he s been moved to scotland  which has
impeded my investigation into his case 
so i m filing this motion
to gain proper access  
free the four

sorry  could you copy that
for me  please 
thank you 
i just want my mother to be happy 
i d like her to know   
that giuseppe talked about her
every day of his life 
he missed her terribly 
it s strange to be in a cell
without him 
i can t seem to get his face
out of my mind 
everywhere i look  i see him 
strange what time does
when you re in prison 
like  you can be staring
at the wall 
drip  drip  drip 
it takes an eternity 
and then you blink 
and three years have gone by 
i mean  what i m trying to  
i don t know what the fuck
i m trying to say 
but i can t forget
what they did to my family 
i just can t forget

what s good about that 
we ll get them in court 
 we ll get them in court

this is the fucking
government  gareth

are you afraid of court 
i just don t wanna be
humiliated again 
i swear by almighty god   
that the evidence i shall give
shall be the truth  the whole truth   
and nothing but the truth 
mr dixon  do you know
these young people   
known as the guildford four 
yes  i do 
do you know how long
they have spent in jail 
fifteen years 
do you know annie maguire   
who served her 14 years
without remission 
do you know her son vincent
who served five years 
her son patrick who served four 
do you know her husband   
paddy maguire  who served 12 years 
carole richardson was 17
when she went to jail  mr dixon 
now she is 32 
do you know carole richardson 
  what is the point of this 
  yes  come to the point 
do you know who this is  mr dixon 
no  i don t 
well  then would you be so kind   
as to read this statement
that you took from him   
on the third of november  1974 
a statement  my lord  which
vindicates all of these people   
 all these innocent people 
 i need to see a copy of this statement 
either that man or his superior
or his superior s superior   
ordered that these people
be used as scapegoats   
by a nation
that was baying for blood   
in return for the innocent blood
spilled on the streets of guildford 
  you got your blood  mr dixon 
  she is making a political speech 
you got the blood of giuseppe conlon
and the lifeblood of carole richardson 
you got 15 years of blood and sweat
and pain from my client   
whose only crime
was that he was irish   
and foolish  and he was in
the wrong place at the wrong time 
mrs peirce  i will have you
removed from the court 
and one of your colleagues 
my lord   
who sat where you sit now said 
 it is a pity   
you were not charged
with treason to the crown  
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging  
a sentence i would have no difficulty
in passing in this case  
mrs peirce  i am trying
to read this document 
i will not tell you again
to be silent   
or you will be removed
from the court 
my lord  this document   
brings the entire british
legal system into disrepute 
my lord  this is new evidence 
it is shocking new evidence 
my lord  this evidence   
was not submitted at the trial
that is under appeal 
that  i believe  is the point
mrs peirce is trying to make 
  proceed  mrs peirce 
  my lord  i demand a recess 
there will be no demands made
in my court 
stand back 
this alibi for gerry conlon   
was taken by mr dixon   
one month after
gerry conlon was arrested 
this note was attached to it
when i found it in police files 
it reads   not to be shown
to the defence  
i have one question
to ask you  mr dixon 
why was the alibi for gerry conlon   
who was charged with the murder
of five innocent people   
kept from the defence 
  give us an answer 
  answer the question 
silence 
  it s about time 
  order in the court 
my lord  i would like
to approach the bench 
this is most irregular 
yes  i am aware of that  my lord 
very well 
mr dixon  you may stand down 
this is the man
who should be under arrest 
be silent  mrs peirce 
  this court is now in recess 
  guards  get ready 
don t try and make me
the fall guy   
for the whole
british legal establishment 
if i accept this mercy deal  
they have a flipping cheek 
offering me mercy 
they should be begging
for mercy themselves 
  you ready  mr conlon 
  aye 
i know the difference
between right and wrong 
the truth has to come out 
they may not want to hear it   
but there s people outside
who ll listen 
 just think about it  will you 
  all right 
aye  give us three of them 
silence 
in the matter of her majesty   
versus gerard patrick conlon   
the case is hereby dismissed 
my husband died in your prison
an innocent man 
i m going out the front door 
i ll see you outside 
  this way 
  i m going out the front door 
what about giuseppe conlon 
your honour 
he was an innocent man 
mr conlon  that s not a good idea 
use the back 
for security reasons 
i m a free man 
and i m going out the front door 
in the matter of
her majesty versus paul hill   
the case is hereby dismissed 
leave me alone 
i m going out the front door with gerry 
in the matter of
her majesty versus patrick armstrong   
the case is hereby dismissed 
in the matter of
her majesty versus carole richardson   
the case is hereby dismissed 
i m an innocent man 
i spent 15 years in prison
for something i didn t do 
i watched my father die   
in a british prison
for something he didn t do 
and this government
still says he s guilty 
i want to tell them   
that until my father
is proved innocent   
until all the people involved
in this case are proved innocent
