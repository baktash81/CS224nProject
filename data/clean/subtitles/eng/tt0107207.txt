jesus its a nightmare giuseppe
just stay calm be on your best
behaviour and thisll be behind us soon
thats it come on
itll be all right
all rise
sir michael hagerty will present
the case on behalf of the crown
there are two series of charges here
ladies and gentlemen
the four defendants in front
are charged with 11 counts in relation
to the explosion of the guildford pub
and the murders of five people
the crown will show
that these were the bombers
the seven defendants behind
are charged with the possession
of explosives not charged with murder
the crowns case
against them is
that they are a support network
for the bombers and as such
should be considered independent
control yourself pay attention
my first witness is
inspector robert dixon
i swear by almighty god that the
evidence i give shall be the truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
inspector why do you believe
these four are the bombers
first hill then conlon
armstrong richardson
confessed to the bombing
they are the iras asu
can you explain asus for us
active service unit
they are the elite of the ira
who carry out
the bombings and the shootings
often they are combat veterans with
experience of shooting at soldiers
and planting explosives
and the others
annie maguire and her family
they are the iras support network
their families and friends store
the weapons and explosives
and they provide
what we call safe houses
thank you inspector
these people were arrested
two days
after the prevention
of terrorism act was introduced
thats correct
can you explain please the powers
that this gives to the police
it permits us to hold
suspected terrorists
for a period of up to seven days
quite extraordinary powers
in a democracy
quite difficult i would think for
the police to resist the temptation
to deal forcibly with people
objection
people they suspect of the biggest
bombing campaign on british mainland
since the second world war
objection my lord i really must
get to the point
now this bombing campaign
struck deep into the british peoples
sense of security
the people looked to you
inspector to find those responsible
yes
you must have been under
the most intense pressure
thats my job
now all of the defendants claim
including young patrick maguire
aged just 14
patrick
would you stand up please
thank you
all of the defendants claim
that they were subjected to physical and
mental abuse while in police custody
they were never harmed
in any way
hes fucking lying
they beat the shite out of us
silence
please believe us
they beat us
just be quiet
sit them down
silence in the court
mr conlon says
that you pulled him by the hair
and squeezed his testicles
i never even spoke to mr conlon
i hope you burn in hell dixon
silence
mr hill says the police sat astride him
and put a gun in his mouth
there was no pressure of any kind
you can go and fuck yourself
you lying fucking bastard
order order in court
inspector in the case
of the four main defendants
you have no corroborating evidence
of any kind
i have the confessions of four obvious
terrorists what more do you want
well nitroglycerine
is a highly toxic substance
its when the substance
to be tested
after a few weeks
we were bored out of our minds
just messed around
and that there
they mustve been
desperate for evidence
they produced annies washingup gloves
like a rabbit out of a hat at one point
then it was my turn
to take the stand
mr conlon
did you bomb guildford
no i didnt
the police claim that you were in
guildford on the night of the bombing
can you tell us where you were
i was in a park in london
at that time
who with
with paul hill sitting there
you met somebody else that night
about 800 pm
aye i met a man called charlie burke
and who is he
he was just a fellow
a homeless guy that we met in the park
why do you remember
this man so clearly
i was thinking that if i didnt get out
of london fast i would end up like him
you told this to the police
aye
what did they say
they said he didnt exist
mr conlon why did you confess
to the guildford bombing
they beat me
and then they threatened
to kill my father
will you repeat that please
they terrorized me for seven days
after that
they threatened to kill my father
id have fucking signed anything
after that
excuse my language
thank you
you expect this jury to believe
that decorated police officers
would risk their career
and their reputation
by threatening your father
i dont expect them to believe it
by the time you finish with them
but it happens to be truth
youre an honest man
arent you mr conlon
i like to think so
youve told us you remember
this charlie burke very well
aye
do you remember telling the police
anything else about that night
let me refresh your memory
you told inspector dixon
that you had committed
a robbery on that night
now do you remember
aye
who did you rob
robbed a hooker
you robbed a prostitute
aye
and we are expected to believe a man
who claims he stole from a prostitute
before we would believe ten police
officers who stood here on oath
and called you a liar
that was the truth
im bound to say i dont find
you very convincing
thank you mr conlon
why didnt you tell me
that youd stole from that woman
you shouldve called me
i wouldve sent the money
are you gonna be a thief
and a liar all your life
standing up in that witness box
making faces to your mates
at least you told the truth
in there thatll stand you
are you not going
to eat that sausage
they put a gun in my mouth
and made me confess
to a murder i didnt commit
so i said i did the big bombing
and named anybody i knew
who was not in the ira
not in the ira
definitely not in the ira
why
you know why
i just wanted to show
how ridiculous it all was
inspector the defendant conlon
presented an alibi
one charlie burke
that name did appear in mr conlons
statement we investigated it
we couldnt find any trace
of such a person
and there was this question
of the robbery of a prostitute
no robberies were reported
in that area that night
at the start of this trial
i shook gerry conlons hand
subsequently i was deeply shocked
when a fellow attorney came to me
and asked me if i was now
going to wash my hand
in my long legal career
i cannot remember a case
where emotions have
been so charged
it falls to me now
to appeal to you
the members of the jury
not to get caught up in this
tide of mass hysteria
inspector dixon admits there are scores
of inconsistencies in the confessions
my clients contend that
they were forced to confess
through brutality
and intimidation
now they may be foolish
petty thieves
even drug abusers
but they are not the ruthless bombers
who have terrorized britain for months
you should find these young people
not guilty
bollocks
okay lets go
get your fucking hands off me
move it
move it
hands off
ladies and gentlemen
like my learned colleague
in the defence
i would caution you not
to be swayed by your emotions
the four people
you see in the front
are one of the most cunning and
cruel criminal conspiracies
ever to set foot on english soil
now here are the facts
of this case
inspector dixon
a decorated officer
of great expertise
acting on reliable information
and good detective work
arrested paul hill
who guiltridden by the shame
of his crime confessed
that confession led the police
to the ringleader conlon
and his terrorist family
his aunt annie maguire
the experienced bomb maker
who wore rubber gloves
when handling explosives
in the kitchen
of her home in harlesden
she even allowed her children
to handle explosives
vincent aged 16
patrick 14
who did not could not
know any better
giuseppe conlon
her brotherinlaw
the courier who arrived
with more explosives
armstrong and his dupe
richardson who carried the bomb
now these are the people who
in a panic
had to dispose
of the nitroglycerine
and that is what sealed
their fate
how do we know this
because the truth was on their hands
it is a story written
in the blood of their victims
you have seen some of those
who survived
their callous disregard
for human life
it is now your duty
to protect society from them
i am confident that
that is what you will do
have you reached a verdict
yes we have my lord
how do you find the defendants
guilty as charged
hang the irie bastards
order silence
string em up
gerard patrick conlon
stand up
i feel it is my duty
to wonder aloud
why you were not charged
with treason to the crown
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging
a sentence i would have had
no difficulty in passing
in this case
i sentence you
to life imprisonment
and i instruct
that you shall serve
a minimum of 30 years
take him down
help me
paul michael hill
in my view your crime
is such that
life shall mean life
annie maguire
i recommend you serve 14 years
what have i done for christs sake
take her down
giuseppe conlon 12 years
no my husbands innocent
lord have mercy on you
patrick joseph armstrong
30 years
carole richardson
30 years
our case was so insane that if you
made it up nobody would believe it
look gareth i know people say
that im a compulsive storyteller
and nobody believed
a word i said in court
but charlie burke did exist hes not
just a figment of my imagination
sorry

joe explained things to me
he explained how the brits
never left anywhere without a fight
how they had to be beaten out of
every country they ever occupied
how this prison was just
an extension of their system
calling for work
on the threes
we had to confront the chief
prison officer barker

but to do that
we had to take care of ronnie smalls

vindicates all of these people
all these innocent people
i need to see a copy of this statement
either that man or his superior

ordered that these people
be used as scapegoats
by a nation

you got the blood of giuseppe conlon
and the lifeblood of carole richardson
you got 15 years of blood and sweat
and pain from my client

was that he was irish
and foolish and he was in
the wrong place at the wrong time
mrs peirce i will have you
removed from the court
and one of your colleagues
my lord
who sat where you sit now said
it is a pity
you were not charged
with treason to the crown
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging
a sentence i would have no difficulty
in passing in this case
mrs peirce i am trying
to read this document
i will not tell you again
to be silent
or you will be removed
from the court
my lord this document
brings the entire british
legal system into disrepute
my lord this is new evidence
it is shocking new evidence

was not submitted at the trial
that is under appeal
that i believe is the point
mrs peirce is trying to make
proceed mrs peirce
my lord i demand a recess
there will be no demands made
in my court
stand back
this alibi for gerry conlon
was taken by mr dixon
one month after
gerry conlon was arrested
this note was attached to it
when i found it in police files
it reads not to be shown
to the defence
i have one question
to ask you mr dixon
why was the alibi for gerry conlon
who was charged with the murder
of five innocent people
kept from the defence
give us an answer
answer the question
silence
its about time
order in the court
my lord i would like
to approach the bench
this is most irregular
yes i am aware of that my lord
very well
mr dixon you may stand down
this is the man
who should be under arrest
be silent mrs peirce
this court is now in recess
guards get ready
dont try and make me
the fall guy
for the whole
british legal establishment
if i accept this mercy deal
they have a flipping cheek
offering me mercy
they should be begging
for mercy themselves
you ready mr conlon
aye
i know the difference
between right and wrong
the truth has to come out
they may not want to hear it
but theres people outside
wholl listen
just think about it will you
all right
aye give us three of them
silence
