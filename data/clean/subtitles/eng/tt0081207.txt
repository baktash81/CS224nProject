a lot of things  i hear 
for one  he s supposed to have
raped a teacher 
i also heard he shot a cop 
i know for a fact he killed a kid 
in cold blood 
blew his brains out 
 clifford 
i don t believe it 
look it up 
it s in the newspapers 
i still don t believe it 
 he would not have stopped then
 for anything
less necessary than breath   
 it being a spectral sort
of race he ran 
 and one highly desirable
to get to the end of 
 he had a strong idea that the coffin
he had seen was running after him 
 and pictured it
hopping on behind him 
 bolt upright upon its narrow end 
 always on the point
of overtaking him
 and hopping on at his side 
 perhaps taking his arm 
 it was a pursuer to shun 
 it hid in doorways  too 
 rubbing its horrible shoulders
against doors
 and drawing them up to its ears
 as if it were laughing 
 it got into shadows on the road
 to trip him up 
 all this time
it was gaining on him 
 when the boy reached his door 
he had reason for being half dead  
no  i mean   
where s my money  rick 
i didn t think i had to pay
 cause clifford isn t 
  what you call me

they can t all be true 
well  i know something 
would you like to know
what i know 
yes 
about a year ago   
he had a younger brother 
and the kid was playing at home 
went into his father s closet 
he found a loaded gun 
was playing
and it accidentally went off 
and he killed himself 
ricky  unfortunately 
was the first person
to find the body 
and i don t think
he s recuperated from that 
that s the only story i know 
what about all those stories
about him killing a cop   
and breaking teachers  legs 
i don t know about those stories 
  all i know is what i just told you 
  okay 
okay 
does that help you at all

okay 
is this saved 
what do you call this stuff 
garbage 
would you pass the salt

maybe i was wrong 
but i thought when somebody
does somebody a favor 
he owes him one 
  you don t owe me 
  yes  i do 
you didn t have to do what you did 
but you did it anyway 
i thought it meant
we were friends now

how s this 
almost 
he was only nine 
i practically raised him
since he was two

couldn t eat food
without spitting it at you 
a real shoplifter  too 
go through a store 
half of it would wind up
in his pocket 
he was a good kid 
a real handful  though
