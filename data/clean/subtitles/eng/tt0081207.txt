raped a teacher
i also heard he shot a cop
i know for a fact he killed a kid
in cold blood
blew his brains out
clifford
i dont believe it
look it up
its in the newspapers
i still dont believe it
he would not have stopped then
for anything
less necessary than breath
it being a spectral sort
of race he ran
and one highly desirable
to get to the end of
he had a strong idea that the coffin
he had seen was running after him
and pictured it
hopping on behind him
bolt upright upon its narrow end
always on the point
of overtaking him
and hopping on at his side
perhaps taking his arm
it was a pursuer to shun
it hid in doorways too
rubbing its horrible shoulders
against doors
and drawing them up to its ears
as if it were laughing
it got into shadows on the road
to trip him up
all this time
it was gaining on him
when the boy reached his door
he had reason for being halfdead
no i mean
wheres my money rick
i didnt think i had to pay
cause clifford isnt
what you call me
