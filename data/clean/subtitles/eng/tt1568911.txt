even if he is a bit barmy
a team of two might manage
given a month and good weather
car horn honking

of course hes watching
albert urging joey
albert come on
come on
well youve raised him up
a true narracott ted
picture of his father he is
not a dollop of ordinary sense
but that thick stubbornness
thatll lead him to insist
on the impossible chuckles
wasnt a farmer in devon
didnt admire you myself among them
leaving your brothers that fine farm
and setting yourself at this stony patch
of unpromising ground
youve fettle enough for 20 men
but with a gimpy leg and the drinking
for the pain isnt it that you drink
none of us could have anticipated
an ending better than this
makes me question
the wisdom of the charity
that urged me to rent you this place
not only looking at you me old pal
but that pretty little wife of yours
thought you were a spark she did
and now your sons sinking into
the selfsame bog thats swallowing you
see joey
i got the collar too

boy mum dad come and look
woman 1 hes doing it
man 1 good lad albie
woman 2 albert well done
man 2 i wouldnt have believed it
id not let a child of mine slip in the mud
alongside a plow blade
he could lose a foot
youll likelier lose an eye mr lyons
if you carry on prating at me
how to manage my son
or my plow or my horse or my field
or my farm
come on albie push on through
get it done albie get it done
albie are you all right
are you all right
up you get
my pair of fools my mighty fools
youre as battered
and bloodied as he is
wheres dad
still in the bottom field
stumbling about i suppose
its not the drink albert
that makes him stumble
he drinks mum
so might you if youd been
where hes been seen what hes seen
he dont talk to me about it
he dont talk about it cause he cant
there arent words for some things
come here
the mice have been at it
sit down
here
its his campaign pennant
he were sergeant 7th battalion
imperial yeomanry
and that is
the queens south africa medal
every man who fought in the boer war
got one of those
and this
thats the
distinguished conduct medal
not dads
well it isnt mine dear
he got that
after the fighting at transvaal
after hed been hurt
and hed saved some other lads
and well i dont know what else
he wont tell me either
but the first day he got home
he just tossed them out
first day he could walk
he threw them straight in the dustbin
and wouldnt hear a word i said not to
see what you done today
you and joey youre chuffed up now
and so you should be my splendid boy
its good to be proud
when youve done something good
but what he done in africa
whatever it was he takes no pride in it
hard as it surely was
and however much pain its cost him
he refuses to be proud of killing
i suppose
id be proud
if id gone off to war
if id gone and saved my mates
whether or not you think
youd do the same thing as him
think how brave he is
for refusing to be proud
your dad makes mistakes
and he drinks to forget
the mistakes that hes made
but he never gave up
and he does that for us
and today you showed the world
its all been worth it
you keep looking after joey
and hell always be looking after you
sergeant 7th battalion
imperial yeomanry
you see this joey
its been through an entire war
im not stealing it
ill give it back to him someday

youre a boche just working out

and kill you first of all
hadnt thought of that
singh that is our target
the german 11th division
at the moment bivouacked three miles
to the east of the menin road
we have been watching them
and they have pitched tents
for the night and lit cooking fires
knock them out and we could slide in
behind the german lines
and come at them from the south
at geluveld
excellent
numbers
about 600 infantry
twice our size
regiments of horse and men
the advantage is ours
and we have surprise on our side

you shouldnt lie to me
here there is no wind here
but over there the wind is so strong
it will lift you off the ground
you lie about everything
you say you arent worried
but its clear you are
i know the war is approaching
but you say
oh its just a trick of the wind
did i say that
you started lying
when mama and papa went away
theyre dead
but you wont say so
do you think ill die
if you tell me the truth
the truth is
you should speak to your elders
with respect
if you tell me the truth about the war
i will tell you the truth
about the big horses
ive been keeping in the windmill
now who is the one telling lies
in the windmill
yes they were standing in the windmill
waiting for don quixote
this is françois and this is claude
i named them after two boys
who broke my heart last summer
they must belong to someone
horses like this dont just appear
from a fairy tale
yes i know grandpére
they are not unicorns
now emilie
so i will be fair and wait one day
and if no one comes to get them
by nighttime
then they belong to me
emilie look at me
you cannot ride
mother used to tell me
how my bones would give way
with the slightest bump or fall
yes thats right so it is settled
good girl
it will only be settled
when i decide which one to ride first
exclaims in frustration
in french
over my dead body
at least i wont have long to wait
i was in love with a boy called françois
who had your lovely eyes
unfortunately he was in love with a girl
called marie who had your teeth
she fell for a boy called claude
who broke my heart
and who i intend to marry one day
chuckles
emilie eyes on me
no talking
today we learn to jump
did you know the french cleared
the 185 meter at the paris olympics
to win the gold medal
today we will beat that record
chuckles
this is your jump
when i call you
be very brave and leap over it
emilie claps
leap over it
watch me
and now its your
chuckles
he doesnt think we can do it
but we will show him wont we
no need to be afraid
you are very tall
youll kill yourself
only if you get in my way
