matted with grass roots 
even a sturdy plow horse

even if he is a bit barmy 
a team of two might manage

leaving your brothers that fine farm
and setting yourself at this stony patch
of unpromising ground 
you ve fettle enough for 20 men 
but with a gimpy leg and the drinking   
for the pain  isn t it  that you drink 
none of us could have anticipated
an ending better than this 
makes me question
the wisdom of the charity
that urged me to rent you this place 
not only looking at you  me old pal 
but that pretty little wife of yours 
thought you were a spark  she did 
and now your son s sinking into
the selfsame bog that s swallowing you

man 2  i wouldn t have believed it 
i d not let a child of mine slip in the mud
alongside a plow blade 
he could lose a foot 
you ll likelier lose an eye  mr  lyons 
if you carry on prating at me
how to manage my son 
or my plow  or my horse  or my field 
or my farm 
come on  albie  push on through 
get it done  albie  get it done 
albie  are you all right 
are you all right 
up you get 
my pair of fools  my mighty fools 
you re as battered
and bloodied as he is 
  where s dad 
  still in the bottom field 
stumbling about  i suppose 
it s not the drink  albert 
that makes him stumble 
he drinks  mum 
so might you if you d been
where he s been  seen what he s seen 
he don t talk to me about it 
he don t talk about it  cause he can t 
there aren t words for some things 
come here 
the mice have been at it 
sit down 
here 
it s his campaign pennant 
he were sergeant  7th battalion 
imperial yeomanry 
and that is
the queen s south africa medal 
every man who fought in the boer war
got one of those 
and this   
that s the
distinguished conduct medal 
  not dad s 
  well  it isn t mine  dear 
he got that
after the fighting at transvaal 
after he d been hurt
and he d saved some other lads 
and  well  i don t know what else 
he won t tell me  either 
but the first day he got home
he just tossed them out 
first day he could walk 
he threw them straight in the dustbin
and wouldn t hear a word i said not to 
see  what you done today 
you and joey  you re chuffed up now 
and so you should be  my splendid boy 
it s good to be proud
when you ve done something good 
but what he done in africa 
whatever it was  he takes no pride in it 
hard as it surely was
and however much pain it s cost him 
he refuses to be proud of killing 
i suppose 
i d be proud 
if i d gone off to war 
if i d gone and saved my mates   
whether or not you think
you d do the same thing as him 
think how brave he is
for refusing to be proud 
your dad makes mistakes 
and he drinks to forget
the mistakes that he s made 
but he never gave up 
and he does that for us 
and today  you showed the world
it s all been worth it 
you keep looking after joey 
and he ll always be looking after you 
 sergeant  7th battalion 
imperial yeomanry  
you see this  joey 
it s been through an entire war

his fair portion of bad luck

you ll stop loving me  rose 
and i won t blame you when you do 
well  i might hate you more

and i m strong  sir 
and i m not afraid of anything 
i don t doubt your qualifications  albert 
but the law is very clear
about the proper age for soldiering 
your father s done what he had to do 
you know that 
thirty guineas isn t nearly enough
to purchase a horse
as fine as your joey  i know that 
but it s all i ve got 
will you lease him to me  albert 
to be my own mount 
i promise you  man to man 
that i ll look after him
as closely as you ve done 
i ll respect him and all the care
that you ve taken with him 
and if i can  i ll return him to your care 
now say goodbye

i m not sure it s going to make
a lot of difference to the germans 
oh  i don t know about that 
think about it 
you re a boche  just working out
which of two chaps to shoot 
and you thought   good lord  
one of them really is wearing
a very stylish cap indeed   
you might shoot the other one instead 
or alternatively think   i fancy that cap  
and kill you first of all 
hadn t thought of that 
singh  that is our target 
the german 11th division 
at the moment bivouacked three miles
to the east of the menin road 
we have been watching them 
and they have pitched tents
for the night and lit cooking fires 
knock them out and we could slide in
behind the german lines
and come at them from the south
at geluveld 
excellent 
  numbers 
  about 600  infantry 
twice our size 
regiments of horse and men 
the advantage is ours 
and we have surprise on our side 
but the sooner we move  the better 
we have no assurance
they ll still be there tomorrow morning 
right  good 
so today it is  charlie  tell the men 
  salisbury formation 
  salisbury formation

and secure the ground behind 
the grass to the left is taller

on reconnaissance is rarely wasted 
nicholls  thank you  singh 
jamie

it s closer today 
the wind plays tricks with the noise 
it s moving away from us 
i can hear it  grand père 
and there is no wind 
you shouldn t lie to me 
here  there is no wind here 
but over there  the wind is so strong
it will lift you off the ground 
you lie about everything 
you say you aren t worried 
but it s clear you are 
i know the war is approaching 
but you say 
 oh  it s just a trick of the wind  
did i say that 
you started lying
when mama and papa went away 
they re dead 
but you won t say so 
do you think i ll die
if you tell me the truth 
the truth is
you should speak to your elders
with respect 
if you tell me the truth about the war 
i will tell you the truth
about the big horses
i ve been keeping in the windmill 
now who is the one telling lies 
in the windmill 
yes  they were standing in the windmill
waiting for don quixote 
this is françois and this is claude 
i named them after two boys
who broke my heart last summer 
they must belong to someone 
horses like this don t just appear
from a fairy tale 
yes  i know  grand pére 
they are not unicorns 
  now  emilie   
  so i will be fair and wait one day 
and if no one comes to get them
by night time 
then they belong to me 
emilie  look at me 
you cannot ride 
mother used to tell me
how my bones would give way
  with the slightest bump or fall 
  yes  that s right  so  it is settled 
good girl 
it will only be settled
when i decide which one to ride first 
 exclaims in frustration
in french 
over my dead body 
at least i won t have long to wait 
i was in love with a boy called françois 
who had your lovely eyes 
unfortunately  he was in love with a girl
called marie  who had your teeth 
she fell for a boy called claude 
who broke my heart
and who i intend to marry one day 
 chuckles 
emilie  eyes on me 
no talking 
today  we learn to jump

to be brave 
did you know the french
have the best carrier pigeons 
and this could be the difference
in the war 
our messages getting through 
i don t want to hear about the birds 
they are released at the front
and told to go home 
this is all they know 
but to get there 
they must fly over a war 
can you imagine such a thing 
here you are flying over
so much pain and terror 
and you know you can never look down 
you have to look forward 
or you ll never get home 
i ask you 
what could be braver than that 
  what is that 
  a present 
i hope you have not bought me
a disgusting dress
that i then have to wear  like last year 
it was disgusting 
  yes 
 laughs 
i looked like an ugly nun 
give me your hand 
grand pére  we have no money 
when the war is over  then you can
buy me jewels and carriages 
anything you say  my sweet one

it was your mother s 
i hid it so as not to encourage you 
emilie  i want you to ride very slowly
