because we have rules on this aircraft 
and they re gonna be enforced 
it s a lot like kindergarten

the need to scream   
spit or bite 
you get the treatment 
  fuck you  pig 
  gag and bag this nazi muffin 
see  this kind of thing
puts me in a foul mood 
these rules will be enforced 
if there s a hint of trouble   
if any of you so much as passes
gas in my direction  it offends
my delicate nasal passages   
your testicles will become
my personal property 
that s pretty clear
