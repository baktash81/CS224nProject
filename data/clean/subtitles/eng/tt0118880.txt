the need to scream
spit or bite
you get the treatment

puts me in a foul mood
these rules will be enforced
if theres a hint of trouble
if any of you so much as passes
gas in my direction it offends
my delicate nasal passages
your testicles will become
my personal property
thats pretty clear
good
thats pretty clear
good
