there you go 
that s it 
zorgons 
they re big  gnarly lizards 
cold blooded heatseekers 
and the tiniest spark of warmth
will bring them in like moths 
flying all around the galaxy   
   looking for anything to burn up 
why don t they just burn up
their own planet 
oh  they already did 
that s not even the worst of it 
the real problem
is their ravenous appetite 
they never stop eating 
what do they eat 
  meat 
  that s good 
dude  you re meat 
are you doing this
to keep zorgons away 
nope 
i m doing this because i ve been
eating paste out of a tube for 15 years

he s eating all our food 
so  lupe just went shopping 
how long do you think
we re gonna be out here 
it could be weeks  then what

   so i don t think a couple dagwood
sandwiches is too much to ask for 
dog  you re eating it all 
i passed through a time sphincter
to get here 
you realize how difficult that is 
what s a time sphincter 
a wormhole  about yay big 
you squeeze through there

hungry enough to eat a carpet shark 
sounds like you got a long trip
ahead of you 
oh  you telling me to leave 
well  i mean  once you get
finished eating  yeah 
i hate to break it to you 
but that s not your call 
he spun me  so it s up to him

  you wished for a football 
signed by brett favre

you could have
just wished the game over 
you could have wished us
out of here 
i was under a lot of pressure 
he was yelling at me 
why were you yelling at him 
okay  guys 
here s the thing 
i ve played this game before 
okay  i played it
with my own brother 15 years ago 
  you re a player 
  yeah  just like you guys 
we were fighting a lot back then 
and when the game started 
it got even worse 
every time we spun  we got madder
and madder at one another 
and then i landed on the star space 
the same one
that walter just landed on 
well  i was so mad at him 
that when the star passed   
   i made my wish 
what d you wish for 
i wished that my brother
had never been born 
oh  my god 
soon as i did it  i felt horrible 
i thought  you know 
if i could spin again   
   maybe i    i could land on another
star space and    and wish him back 
but the game wouldn t let me
