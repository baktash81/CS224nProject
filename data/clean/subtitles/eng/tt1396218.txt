you know 
that s always been a dream of mine 
oh  he had some stories 
like that storm off the horn of africa 
  the horn of africa 
  oh  yeah 
the sea was calm  the sailing smooth 
when  out of nowhere   
twenty foot swells 
like a hammer punch to the prow 
dad was a heck of a sailor 
but he d never seen waves like this 
gale force winds
straight from the devil s nostrils
whipped his ship like a rubber ducky 
the salt spray in his face
felt like a thousand needles 
and suddenly  the wind ripped
the mainsail off the mast 
he was doomed 
what did he do 
  what did he do 
  yes 
he spun the wheel 
hoisted the jib 
threaded the needle backwards 
and when he came out the other side   
oh  my god 
oh  my god 
  what 
  it can t be  but it is 
what is it 
a blue whale 
like a gentle giant 
the most majestic creature on earth

a rainbow
in the spray of his mighty blowhole

of franklin  reader   yates

my grandmother served coq au vin
for winston churchill 
and my father poured champagne
for fred astaire 
my mother made a blt
for kareem abdul jabbar once 
she said he was
surprisingly down to earth 
which is ironic  considering
how tall he is 
fascinating

i mean 
i consider the staff to be family  too 
nothing is more important
than family to me  nothing

and your life beyond all of this 
picture yourself in a boat on a river 
with tangerine trees
and kind of a marmalade sky 
i don t do drugs  mr  popper 
let me tell you something 
i could sell this place
to any number of sharp tongued
snake oil salesmen like yourself 
but i m not selling to anyone

popper  where have you been 
hey  guys 
we talked to van gundy s people 
they say she turned you down flat 
fellas  calm down  life s too short 
especially for franklin 
we thought we could trust you with this 
hey  taming of the shrew
is not a one act play 
you know that she s the chair of
several charitable foundations 
one of those foundations
is having a benefit
at the guggenheim saturday 
and mr  popper will be present 
i figured it out 
she s looking for somebody
with integrity and character 
somebody like jimmy stewart 
and  doggone it 
that s exactly what i m going to be 
i ll use my own voice  though 
although  that was uncanny 
come on  give it to me 
we expect some results  popper 
and until we get them  you can keep
your name off my marble slab 
a man your age shouldn t be
talking about marble slabs 
i got this 
penguins  pippi  talk to me 
per your predicament 
i printed a pertinent page from wikipedia 
 gentoo penguins
may periodically imprint
 on a particular person
as if they were a penguin 
 once imprinted  they remain permanently
proximate to their parental proxy  
is it actually written that way 
i m paraphrasing 
they re imprinting  all right 
 uncanny tracking ability 
can locate each other at great distance  
  what about keeping them in line 
  next paragraph 
 are more docile
when kept at lower temperatures  
hmm 
cold enough for you 
glad you re comfortable  ow 
hey  this is a finger  this is a fish 
learn to tell the difference 
hey  kids 
it s nice  huh  a little fresh air 
it s not bad if you keep moving 
captain  bitey  stinky 
penguins need it cold 
otherwise they get wing mange 
dad  are you okay 
yeah  never better 
let s take the penguins to the park 
billy  no  what if they run off 
ah 
you know  maybe they are
a little cooped up in here 
boy  look at all this space 
makes you want to spread out and explore 
get lost for a while 
flight envy  really 
that s hilarious 
i hate to break it to you  captain

i think you might be more fish
than fowl

i ever got to see him 
thanks  dad 
it s actually a good memory 
sometimes they re the worst 
we were married for 15 years 
and you have never told me that 
hmm 
you are a complicated man  mr  popper 
i don t know 
i think this old place has still got it 
where are we going 
that s for me to know
and you to find adorable 
oh  really 
yes 
right  left 
right  left  right 
well  we re out of the medals 
but we had a good time 
nice trick 
i can t believe we re doing this 
i brought a girl here
once  a long time ago 
it was closed 
so we broke in and stole skates 
she sounds amazing 
i thought so 
then she got on the ice 
and she was kind of a clutz 
i think she was just trying to impress you

about animal care  mr  popper 
you stick them in front of the tv 
yeah  chaplin  a classic 
you ve got one nesting
in the produce bin of your refrigerator 
just shows what you know 
that s a cheese drawer

you have no idea
what you re doing with these birds 
like you re some kind of penguin expert 
i am a penguin expert 
yeah  but    yeah  okay

and put them in a proper home 
you aren t giving them what they need 
i am giving them exactly what they need

i am giving them love 
love 
well  it sounds weird
when you make me say it 
these aren t children  mr  popper 
they re animals 
they need food  they need snow 
and every once in a while 
one of them needs to be eaten by a whale 
hey 
you want to know who they love 
i ll tell you who they love 
whoever is holding the fish 
traitors

  pretty good date so far 
  we re just getting started 
driver  tavern on the green 
hold on  boss  hold on  i got it 
hey  hey  stop 
there have been
a lot of rumors floating around lately 
and i m here to clear them up 
i have always said
that i would only sell the tavern   
if i found the right person 
and that s why i m here to announce   
wait 
don t
do   
it 
did you like that  the slow motion effect 
i just wanted to get your attention 
mrs  van gundy  you can t sell this place 
  i know 
  if you sell it to me 
i ll just tear it down 
and then freddy and tito and klaus 
and the guy that looks like chef boyardee
will be out on the street 
  i know 
  this place is a part of new york history 
it s a part of my history 
i came here with my father 
the other day i had the best
second first date a man could ever have 
and i would rather cut my hands off
and stick knives in my eyes than   
wait  i d have to do the eyes first
and then the hands 
and i d have to have somebody
help me cut the right hand off
  because the left hand would be gone 
  mr  popper  stop talking 
  okay 
  i m not selling 
you re not 
mmm mmm 
glad we got dressed up 
there he is 
excuse me  folks 
nat jones  new york zoo 
this man has been trafficking
in stolen penguins 
what are you even talking
about from left field 
penguins 
it s absurd 
no  no  no  penguins  please 
hi  pip  i thought you were
going to stay in the car 
they pecked the power locks 
he has been keeping
these defenseless creatures
locked away in his apartment 
when i tried to save them 
he broke into the zoo and kidnapped them 
i ve seen these penguins before 
is it true  mr  popper 
yes  i m afraid so 
why did you do it 
knowing you 
it must be for some sort of personal gain 
yes  the kind no amount of money can buy 
for pete s sake 
mr  popper and his equally crazy family
believe that these penguins love him 
they are wrong 
if they have to choose between love
and a nice juicy sardine 
they will choose the fish every time 
  i don t think so 
  let s find out 
he s got a fish 
i got this 
come on  guys 
come on 
come on  yeah 
that s right 
captain  come on 
come to popper 
hey  that s my guys 
no  that doesn t prove anything 
come on  aren t you going to arrest him 
for what  winning 
is that what we do in this country 
is that what america is all about 
i don t think so  i don t think so 
america 
have you people lost your mind 
he s breaking the law 
come on  guy  have a heart 
have a heart 
i m going to call the chief of police 
i m going to call the mayor 
oh  allow me

hmm 
yo  vip  let s kick it
all right  stop  collaborate  and listen
ice is back
with my brand new invention
something grabs a hold of me tightly
flow like a harpoon  daily and nightly
will it ever stop  yo  i don t know
turn off the lights and i ll glow
to the extreme
i rock a mic like a vandal
light up a stage
and wax a chump like a candle
dance  go rush the speaker that booms
i m killing your brain
like a poisonous mushroom
deadly when i play a dope melody
anything less than the best is a felony
love it or leave it  you better gang way
you better hit bull s eye 
the kid don t play
if there was a problem  yo 
i ll solve it
check out the hook while my dj revolves it
ice  ice  baby
vanilla ice  ice  baby
vanilla ice  ice  baby
vanilla ice  ice  baby
vanilla
now that the party is jumping
with the bass kicked in
and the vega s are pumpin 
quick to the point  to the point  no faking
cooking mc s like a pound of bacon
burning  em  if you ain t quick and nimble
i go crazy when i hear a cymbal
and a high hat with a souped up tempo
i m on a roll  it s time to go solo
ice  ice  baby
vanilla ice  ice  baby
vanilla
take heed  cause i m a lyrical poet
miami s on the scene
just in case you didn t know it
my town that created all the bass sound
enough to shake
and kick holes in the ground
 cause my style s like a chemical spill
feasible rhymes you can vision and feel
conducted and formed 
this is a hell of a concept
we make it hype and you want to step
with this  shay plays on the fade
slice like a ninja  cut like a razor blade
so fast other dj s say   damn  
if my rhyme was a drug
i d sell it by the gram
keep my composure
when it s time to get loose
magnetized by the mic while i kick my juice
if there was a problem  yo 
i ll solve it
