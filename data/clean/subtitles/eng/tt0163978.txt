stuff about my family
or where im from
none of that matters
not once you cross the ocean
and cut yourself loose
looking for something more beautiful
something more exciting
and yes i admit
something more dangerous
so after 18 hours in
the back of an airplane
three dumb movies two plastic meals
six beers and absolutely no sleep
i finally touch down
hey you how about you
in bangkok
do you want to go to the waterfall
floating market
1500 thb cheap for you
come on hey
hey do you need
somewhere to stay
ill find my own place thanks
what you want man
and this is it bangkok
goodtime city
gateway to southeast asia
where dollars and deutschmarks get turned
into counterfeit watches and genuine scars
good time boy girl
fucking no problem
this is where the hungry come to feed
you wanna drink snake blood
wait a minute
did you say snake blood
oh yeah
no thanks
what is wrong with snake blood
i just dont like the idea
maybe youre scared
afraid of something new
i just dont like the idea
like every tourist
you want it all be safe
just like america
so never refuse an invitation
never resist the unfamiliar
never fail to be polite
gentlemen
that was excellent
and never outstay your welcome
just keep your mind open
and suck in the experience
and if it hurts
its probably worth it
hey
good evening
hi
can i get a room please
yes
the only downer is
everyones got the same idea
we all travel thousands of miles
just to watch tv and check into
somewhere with all the comforts of home
and you gotta ask yourself
well have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy so dont you worry
what is the point of that
et voila
thank you
bonsoir
bonsoir

the police were pissed because he was
traveling under a false passport

hey you wanna take a hike
uh aa trip a journey
with yyour girlfriend and me
i mean the two of you
and me together
iim talking about the secret isla
hi
hi
i just feel like everyone tries
to do something different but
you always wind up doing the same thing
i realised that i had absolutely no idea
of how i was gonna get there
but etienne
i mean i have to hand it
to the guy he was great
i mean he organized
the whole thing tickets
timetables the whole damn trip
bangkok to surat thani
surat thani to na thon
na thon to chaweng
500 miles in 24 hours
at less than 400 baht
trust me
thats a very good deal
we were headed for the great unknown
but to get there we had to
follow the regular tourist trail
a little less pushin and shovin
take it easy
you could even get sleazy
come around
watch a movie
with the sound down
and get woozy
its arranged tomorrow
morning 1800 baht
ah great man nice work
there is one problem
he will not take us to the island
its in the national park and
its forbidden to go there but
we are allowed to travel to
this one to stay for one night
yeah no see
thats the wrong one
yeah i know that
right but how do we get
from there to there
we swim
we swim
yeah we leave our rucksacks
on this island and then we swim
you can swim cant you richard
of course i can swim
so no problem
so hhow far is it though
i dont know
one or two kilometers
cool cool not far at all
stop it richard it will be worth it
an adventure and just
the three of us
uhoh
can you swim
i can swim oh yeah i am french and
i have the beautiful girlfriend too huh
great
goddammit
locked out huh
yeah
lost your key
uhhuh
bummer
yeah bummer
so uh you wanna
grab a beer or somethin
youre better off without her
sammy how the fuck would you know
youve never even met her
im just tryin to help the guy
through the dark times
its not a problem
you see zeph
its not a problem
change the fuckin subject
all right lets talk about how you spend
an hour in front of the mirror every day
oh thats nice you know this guy
he likes to wipe his ass with tree leaves
he thinks hes some sort of
jungle commando
whatever
i swear to god
whatever
damn
i presume
you know the story
of the kentucky fried mouse
yeah
woman bites into a chicken leg
and it turns out to be
uh a mouse
right
its an urban myth
exactly it always happened to a
friend of a friend of someone else
so
so
i guess theres this urban myth
goin around here at the moment
its about a beach
yeah
uhhuh
and this beach is
perfect man
its on an island right
hidden from the sea
now imagine you got
pure white sand
crystalclear water
palm trees
yeah with coconuts and shit
yo tell him the best part dawg
plus
enough dope richard
to smoke all day
every day
for the rest of your goddamn life
yeah mad weed
only a few people know exactly where
it is and they keep it absolutely secret
no ones actually ever
met any of these people
exactly its a
kentucky fried mouse
hm
although if i had a key
to a place like that
id keep it to myself cos you dont
want every fuckin asshole in thailand
turnin up booboo
yeah yeah
so whaddaya think
about that story richard
its good
its a good story
hey you
i got your key
now i know it wasnt
a part of the plan
but i made a decision
to leave a copy of the map
im not gonna say it was
the best decision i ever made
i told myself that spreading news
is a part of a travelers nature
but if i was being completely honest
i was just like everybody else
shitscared of the great unknown
desperate to take a little
piece of home with me
richard
are you ready
yeah yeah im coming
lets go
feel dead
feel dead
feel dead
feel dead
happy
francoise
chut etienne will be
angry if i wake him
he thinks i waste time
taking photographs of the sky
oh
i think so too
yeah
have a look
one night i will get the
perfect photograph
hi
whoa
you realise that
in the eternity of space
theres probably a
planet out there right
just like this one
where another you
is photographing back down towards us
i mean essentially you are photographing
yourself in a parallel universe
incredible
yeah
there are infinite worlds
out there ya know
where anything you want to happen
does happen
richard do you know something
hm
this is just the kind of
pretentious bullshit
americans always say to french girls
so they can sleep with them
god sorry
i thought i was doin pretty good
its just the sky
richard lets try
yeah
idiot
un deux trois
quatre
when you develop
an infatuation for someone
you always find a reason to believe
that this is exactly the person for you
it doesnt need to be a good reason
taking photographs of the night sky
for example
now in the long run
thats just the kind of dumb irritating
habit that would cause you to split up
but in the haze of infatuation
its just what youve been
searching for all these years
one kilometer
two
richard
i dont know im american
so
we think in miles not kilometers
ok so how many miles
do you think it is
i dont know
but it looks like a long way away
if its too far
were gonna drown
but if we dont try
well never know right
right
so lets go
whoo
are you guys all right
yeah were ok
i think were about halfway
oh fuck richard
fuck
what
i saw a fin
tsk what are you joking
no no no
a fin
ok a shark fin
i dont know just a fin
over there about 100 metres
well was it big
yes
what the fuck do you expect
me to do about it
nothing i just thought
you should know
to be honest id rather
you hadnt told me
ok im sorry
well its a bit fuckin
late now isnt it
francoise francoise shes gone

not just passing through

hotel room on the khao san road
you have seen this
well i came afterwards

this became our world
and these people our family
back home was just one more
place we didnt think about
i settled in
i found my vocation
the pursuit
of pleasure
sal was the leader
but it wasnt a big deal i mean
there wasnt any ideology or shit like that
it was just a beach resort
for people who dont like beach resorts
some of us build
even paradise takes a little shaping
for years they kept this place a secret
they didnt need to tell anyone
they were practically selfsufficient
the only thing they had to do
was sail back once in a while
to trade a little marijuana
and buy some rice
we grow our own so no stealing
from the farmers on the other side
and do they know that
youre living here
oh yeah but they keep to their side
and we dont trespass on their turf
a couple of years ago they said that we
could stay but nobody else should come
which kind of suits us as well
so you was lucky ya know
very lucky
there was keaty who only
cared about two things
thank you lord
for the twin pillars of civilization
christianity
and cricket
there were the swedes
christo sten and karl
we like fishing
and in the winter we like skiing
yeah
of course in thailand
there is no skiing
we wait ok
we wait for the fish to come
get it
shit no way
whoo
and i said to thee i shall provide
yeah
stop it
what
our resident chef was
known as unhygenix
lets cook
on account of his obsession with soap
fish fish fish
still i smell of fish
there was a range of sporting
and leisure activities to suit all tastes
etienne is good at soccer

is that right
come on your last girlfriend chucked ya
it was not my fault
look at your thumbs man

i mean the beach ya know
its just perfect
do you think that i ignore you

but i do
its because im with etienne
its difficult for me to
spend time with you
i dont suppose that theres any
you know special reason that you should
spend time with me that is
of course there is
i like you
a lot
have you have you
told this to etienne or
no
its our secret
ok
look there the plankton shrimps
when theyre disturbed they glow

that no one would ever know
i wanna talk
about what
about you and francoise
whaddaya mean
me and francoise
i mean richard
that i want her to be happy
yeah
i mean of course
we all do right
shut up
please shut the fuck up
and if happy is with you
then i will not stand in her way
etienne man i
i dont know what youre talking about
fuck you richard i know
ok i know
everybody knows
the problem is seeing the fish
with the heavy rain
and the bad light
its very difficult to catch them
it can last for days
sometimes
we get really hungry
gimme that
richard
richard richard
come out
i cant hear you
and you cant hear me
shark
come
shark
ohh
all right all right
all right all right all right
shh
now before i start theres just a couple
of things you have to remember
you have to remain calm
right
you have to show no fear
teach it teach it
because the sharks
you see the sharks
they can sense that fear
just as easily as
they can sense blood
and so it went for me
just as i knew it would
just as nature had ordained
its jaw wide open
row upon row of these razorsharp teeth
glinting underwater like jagged diamonds
its tail fin sweeping back and
forth as it surged in for the kill
i swear to god
my whole life
flashed before my eyes
really
i had nothing left to offer
except for pure reflex
pure reflex
and mankinds basic drive
for survival that somehow
shouts no i will not die today
yes
whoo
at that instant i knew
it was either the shark or me
the shark knew it
i knew it
but jeez god
its nothin personal right its just
the way the world works its nature
but if i remember correctly
in that last glimmer of its eyes
there was a moment between us
where it said hey richard man
enjoy your dinner
strange thing killing a shark
isnt it richard
its just a big fish bugs
just a big fish
yeah maybe maybe when its just a baby
and it hasnt really learned to kill yet
then maybe its just a big fish
but when its a great white angry mother
with the taste of blood on its tongue
now thats a different story
oh god jeez
im sorry bugs
is it just me
or does this wet weather
make everyone so damn tired
maybe we can hear your very different
and im sure very interesting story
some other time huh
very interesting keaty
verlo interesantno
molto interessante
good night young lovers

by the hand of the almighty
we forward in this generation
triumphantly
wont you help to sing
these songs of freedom
cos all i ever had
redemption song
redemption song
argh
after the funeral
we all tried to get back to normal
but it just didnt seem right
no steady job
pretty soon it became clear
the problem was christo
shut up
you see in a shark attack
or any other major tragedy i guess
the important thing is
to get eaten and die
in which case theres a funeral
and somebody makes a speech
and everybody says
what a good guy you were
or get better
in which case everyone
can forget about it
i cant take this
christo please
every two or three autumns
great atmosphere
get better or die
its the hanging around in between
that really pisses people off
listen to me
you cant do this
this is disgusting
take him back
ok just here
fucking animals
what are you doing this for huh
tell me
how can you do this
richard
fucking bastards
bastards
it would be a lot easier to condemn our
behaviour if it hadnt been so effective
but out of sight
really was out of mind
once he was gone
we felt a whole lot better
on the beach
its easy to turn your back
but not always so easy to forget
pay them in dollars fuck their daughters
and turn it into wonderland richard
richard come with me
is that or is that not
a map shes holding
and did you
or did you not
make that copy
you know
the lying doesnt bother me
but that map
is trouble
the farmers right
you remember those men with guns
they said to us they told us
no more people
and now it looks like were
handing out fucking tour guides
sal i mean
we could explain right
i mean we could tell em it was daffy
we could explain
i want you up here every day
until those people come
here
yes here
i want you to get the map back
ok whatever happens
you get the map back
wwait sal
sal they could be there for weeks
thats right
and youll be here waiting for them
what am i supposed to do when they come
get the map
you drew it you handed it out
now you get it back and turn them away
sal sal
are you gonna tell
em what else i did
now this was truly a pain in the ass
i didnt want these people to
come here anymore than sal did
but what exactly did
she expect me to do
chase them away threaten them
i mean with what
by the time these kids go there
id probably have starved to death
sal
sal is that you get that light outta
youre a pig
dammit what the fuck was that for
theres nothing i can do
i have to stay up here
not that ok
what is it then
you and sal in ko phangan
oh that
yeah that
she has told everyone
and me im the last one to find out
at least she believes in honesty
not like you
i mean francoise i
what what can i say
nothing theres nothing you can say
thank you
thank you for making
my life just perfect
super
god
dammit
shit
you are such an idiot
even though i knew it would happen
i was crushed
and i guess i deserved it
i coulda given her all
the excuses she wanted
but it wouldnt have
made any difference
great great
at first i thought i
was gonna die up here
that my entire world was gonna end
but it didnt
in fact
pretty soon i found that there were
plenty of other things to keep me occupied
and before i knew it
i found that love like grief
tends to fade away
and be replaced by
something more exciting
and life up on the hill turned
out to be a big improvement
i mean up here
i could do what ever i wanted
there was no fishing duty
no gardening shit
no hassle from bugs or
etienne or francoise
i was playing my own game now
and i had absolutely
no reason to go back
ok so i was just foolin around
but the longer i stayed away from
the community the less i missed them
and i found new players
even if they didnt know it yet
this forest was my territory
retrieving the map
my mission
and these
my defenders
i was the only one
with the overview
of how it all fitted together
the island

all playing the same game
and at the centre of it all

no no

cmon hold on to me
game over
but she was never gonna leave
she believed in it all
way too much to ever change
so thats exactly where we left her
we sailed to the seven seas
searching for the missing key
unlocking you
the worlds harmony
we climbed the highest
mountain range
then we took the longest day
and as for the rest of us
we carried away our sins and made our way
back to wherever it was we called home
to pick up the pieces
of whatever was waiting
of course you can never forget
what youve done
but we adapt
we carry on
the heat and rhythm
in the rivers run
and blinding faith in the desert sun
hear them today
play all as one
distant voices sang the faroff sky
led us to that elusive prize
can i get you anything
no thanks
and me
i still believe in paradise
but now at least i know
its not some place you can look for
because its not where you go
its how you feel for a moment in your
life when youre a part of something
and if you find that moment
it lasts for ever
god knows youre lonely souls
god knows youre lonely souls
god knows youre lonely souls
yeah yeah
i believe theres a time and a place
to let your minds reflect
get out of this place
i believe theres a day and a place
that we will go to
and i know you wanna share
theres no secret to living
theres no secret to living
just keep on walking
theres no secret to dying
theres no secret to dying
just keep on flying
im gonna die in a place
that dont know my name
im gonna die in a space
that dont hold my name
ooohooh
walking in the cold
just keep on flying
god knows youre lonely souls
god knows youre lonely souls
god knows youre lonely souls
god knows youre lonely souls
yeeah yeeah
yeeah yeeah yeeah
all the lonely souls
place that dont know my name
aha

im gonna die in a place
that dont know my name
because we are lonely souls

so long in the shadows
