stuff about my family
or where i m from 
none of that matters 
not once you cross the ocean
and cut yourself loose   
   looking for something more beautiful 
something more exciting   
   and yes  i admit 
something more dangerous 
so after 18 hours in
the back of an airplane   
   three dumb movies  two plastic meals 
six beers and absolutely no sleep   
   i finally touch down   
  hey  you  how about you 
    in bangkok 
do you want to go to the waterfall 
floating market 
1 500 thb  cheap for you 
come on  hey 
hey  do you need
somewhere to stay 
  i ll find my own place  thanks 
  what you want  man 
and this is it  bangkok 
good time city 
gateway to southeast asia 
where dollars and deutschmarks get turned
into counterfeit watches and genuine scars 
good time  boy  girl 
fucking  no problem 
  this is where the hungry come to feed 
  you wanna drink snake blood 
wait a minute 
did you say snake blood 
oh  yeah 
  no  thanks 
  what is wrong with snake blood 
  i just    don t like the idea 
  maybe you re scared 
  afraid of something new 
  i just don t like the idea 
like every tourist 
you want it all be safe 
just like america 
so never refuse an invitation 
never resist the unfamiliar 
never fail to be polite 
gentlemen   
   that was excellent 
and never outstay your welcome 
just keep your mind open
and suck in the experience 
and if it hurts   
   it s probably worth it 
hey 
  good evening 
  hi 
  can i get a room  please 
  yes 
the only downer is 
everyone s got the same idea 
we all travel thousands of miles   
   just to watch tv and check into
somewhere with all the comforts of home 
and you gotta ask yourself   
we ll have this place cleaned up
in a jiffy  so don t you worry 
   what is the point of that 
  et voila 
  thank you 
bonsoir 
bonsoir 
good night 
and as for traveling alone   
   fuck it

then that s the way it is

see  it s sealed in by cliffs 
totally fuckin  secret  totally fuckin    
   forbidden 
and nobody can ever  ever   
   ever  ever go there  ever 
but a few people went   
   once upon a time 
men and women with ideals 
you understand 
i m not just talking about the usual   
travelin  fuckin  wanks

do you   
hello 
you hope   
   and you dream   
   but you never believe that
something s gonna happen for you 
not like it does in the movies 
and when it actually does   
   you want it to feel different 
more visceral 
more real 
i was waiting for it to hit me 
but it just wouldn t happen 
the name of mr  daffy duck 
never never land 
gonna fuck up all the paperwork 
the police were pissed because he was
traveling under a false passport 
go ahead  sign the statement 
it s ok 
it just say he cut his wrists 
already dead when you found him 
but they didn t ask me
about the map  so   
no problem 
   i didn t tell  em 
you have a nice day 
good luck 
excuse me 
look    i mean   
   this island may not actually even exist 
even if it does  i don t know
if we can get there or not 
i just wondered if you
wanted to come with me 
that s all 
hey  you wanna take a hike 
uh    a a trip  a journey 
with y your girlfriend and me 
i mean  the two of you
and me  together 
  i i m talking about the secret isla    
  hi 
hi 
i just feel like everyone tries
to do something different  but   
   you always wind up doing the same thing 
i realised that i had absolutely no idea
of how i was gonna get there 
but etienne   
i mean  i have to hand it
to the guy  he was great 
i mean  he organized
the whole thing  tickets   
   timetables  the whole damn trip 
bangkok to surat thani 
surat thani to na thon 
na thon to chaweng 
500 miles in 24 hours   
   at less than 400 baht 
trust me 
that s a very good deal 
we were headed for the great unknown 
but to get there  we had to
follow the regular tourist trail 
  a little less pushin  and shovin   
  take it easy  
  you could even get sleazy  
  come around  
  watch a movie  
  with the sound down  
  and get woozy     
it s arranged  tomorrow
morning  1800 baht 
ah  great man  nice work 
there is one problem 
he will not take us to the island 
it s in the national park and
it s forbidden to go there  but   
   we are allowed to travel to
this one to stay for one night 
yeah    no  see 
that s the wrong one 
yeah  i know that 
right  but how do we get
from there to there 
  we swim 
  we swim 
yeah  we leave our rucksacks
on this island and then we swim 
  you can swim  can t you  richard 
  of course i can swim 
  so no problem 
  so h how far is it  though 
i don t know 
one or two kilometers 
  cool  cool    not far at all
  stop it  richard  it will be worth it 
an adventure  and just   
the three of us 
uh oh 
 can you swim  
 i can swim  oh  yeah  i am french and
i have the beautiful girlfriend  too  huh  
great
  goddammit 
  locked out  huh

  uh huh 
  bummer 
  yeah  bummer 
so  uh    you wanna
grab a beer or somethin  
  you re better off without her 
  sammy  how the fuck would you know  
you ve never even met her 
i m just tryin  to help the guy
through the dark times 
  it s not a problem 
  you see  zeph 
  it s not a problem 
  change the fuckin  subject 
all right  let s talk about how you spend
an hour in front of the mirror every day 
oh  that s nice you know this guy 
he likes to wipe his ass with tree leaves 
he thinks he s some sort of
jungle commando 
  whatever 
  i swear to god 
  whatever 
  damn 
i presume   
   you know the story
of the kentucky fried mouse 
yeah 
woman bites into a chicken leg   
   and it turns out to be 
uh    a mouse 
right 
it s an urban myth 
exactly  it always happened to a
friend of a friend of someone else 
  so 
  so   
   i guess there s this urban myth
goin  around here at the moment 
it s about a beach 
  yeah 
  uh huh 
and this beach is   
perfect  man 
it s on an island  right 
hidden from the sea 
now  imagine  you got   
   pure white sand 
crystal clear water 
  palm trees 
  yeah  with coconuts and shit 
yo  tell him the best part  dawg 
plus   
   enough dope  richard   
   to smoke all day 
every day   
     for the rest of your goddamn life 
  yeah  mad weed 
only a few people know exactly where
it is  and they keep it absolutely secret 
no one s actually ever
met any of these people 
exactly  it s a
kentucky fried mouse 
hm 
although  if i had a key
to a place like that   
   i d keep it to myself cos    you don t
want every fuckin  asshole in thailand   
   turnin  up  boo boo 
yeah  yeah 
so whaddaya think
about that story  richard 
it s good 
it s a good story 
hey  you 
i got your key 
now  i know it wasn t
a part of the plan   
   but i made a decision
to leave a copy of the map 
i m not gonna say it was
the best decision i ever made 
i told myself that spreading news
is a part of a traveler s nature 
but if i was being completely honest   
   i was just like everybody else 
   shit scared of the great unknown 
desperate to take a little
piece of home with me 
  richard 
  are you ready 
yeah  yeah  i m coming 
let s go 
feel dead
feel dead
feel dead
feel dead
happy
francoise 
chut  etienne will be
angry if i wake him 
he thinks i waste time 
taking photographs of the sky 
oh   
  i think so  too 
  yeah 
have a look 
one night  i will get the
perfect photograph 
hi 
whoa 
you realise that   
   in the eternity of space   
   there s probably a
planet out there  right   
   just like this one   
   where another you   
   is photographing back down towards us 
i mean  essentially  you are photographing
yourself in a parallel universe 
incredible 
yeah   
there are infinite worlds
out there  ya know 
where anything you want to happen   
   does happen 
richard  do you know something 
hm 
this is just the kind of
pretentious bullshit   
   americans always say to french girls   
so they can sleep with them 
god  sorry 
i thought i was doin  pretty good 
it s just the sky 
richard  let s try 
yeah 
idiot 
un  deux  trois   
   quatre 
when you develop
an infatuation for someone   
   you always find a reason to believe
that this is exactly the person for you 
it doesn t need to be a good reason 
taking photographs of the night sky 
for example 
now  in the long run   
   that s just the kind of dumb  irritating
habit that would cause you to split up 
but in the haze of infatuation   
   it s just what you ve been
searching for all these years 
  one kilometer 
  two 
  richard 
  i don t know  i m american 
  so 
  we think in miles  not kilometers 
ok  so how many miles
do you think it is 
i don t know 
but it looks like a long way away 
if it s too far 
we re gonna drown 
but if we don t try 
we ll never know  right 
right 
so let s go 
whoo 
  are you guys all right 
  yeah  we re ok 
i think we re about halfway 
oh  fuck  richard 
  fuck

i saw a fin 
  tsk  what  are you joking

me to do about it  
nothing  i just thought
you should know 
to be honest  i d rather

maybe even a few guys in tents 
gregorio 
but nothing like this 
  how are you  keaty 
  don t smoke  em 
it was like we arrived
into a lost world 
a full scale community of travelers 
not just passing through 
but actually living here 
i suddenly became aware   
   that we weren t even invited 
  the guy who drew it 
  daffy 
yeah    yeah  he s dead 
what  no way 
yeah  he cut his wrists open in a
hotel room on the khao san road 
  you have seen this  
  well  i came afterwards 
well  that s sad news 
he was    one of the founders
of our community 
oh 
but he became depressed 
crazy 
the police didn t know what to do with
the body  so i guess they ll incinerate him 
do you think he gave a
map to anybody else 
i i    no  i don t think so 
and you  have you
shown this map to anybody

this became our world 
and these people  our family 
back home was just one more
place we didn t think about 
i settled in 
i found my vocation 
   the pursuit   
   of pleasure 
sal was the leader 
but it wasn t a big deal  i mean 
there wasn t any ideology or shit like that 
it was just a beach resort   
for people who don t like beach resorts 
   some of us build 
even paradise takes a little shaping 
for years  they kept this place a secret 
they didn t need to tell anyone 
they were practically self sufficient 
the only thing they had to do
was sail back once in a while
to trade a little marijuana
and buy some rice 
we grow our own  so no stealing
from the farmers on the other side 
and do they know that
you re living here 
oh  yeah  but they keep to their side
and we don t trespass on their turf 
a couple of years ago  they said that we
could stay  but nobody else should come 
  which kind of suits us as well 
  so you was lucky  ya know 
very lucky 
there was keaty  who only
cared about two things 
thank you  lord   
   for the twin pillars of civilization 
   christianity   
   and cricket 
there were the swedes 
   christo  sten and karl 
we like fishing 
  and in the winter  we like skiing 
  yeah 
of course  in thailand 
there is no skiing 
we wait  ok 
we wait for the fish to come 
get it 
  shit  no way 
  whoo 
and i said to thee  i shall provide  
yeah 
  stop it 
  what 
our resident chef was
known as unhygenix 
let s cook 
on account of his obsession with soap 
fish  fish  fish 
still i smell of fish 
there was a range of sporting
and leisure activities to suit all tastes 
etienne is good at soccer 
ya know  i could do
that if i wanted to 
  i just don t want to 
  what are you talking about 
  making conversation 
  do you have a girlfriend 
  here

just making conversation 
whoo 
right arm over wicket 
three balls remaining

still doesn t understand 
the only person i didn t like was sal s
boyfriend  bugs  our on island carpenter 
hey  richard 
can you do this 
can you make anything 
a man should have a
talent in his hands 
here we go  people 
surprise

has its rituals 
the last one to arrive
tattoos the next

agh 
andy  bring yours closer 
come on  richard 
ohhhh  god 
ohh  god 
ohh  jesus 
that fuckin  hurt 
all in all 
this really was paradise 
except for one thing 
desire is desire   
   wherever you go 
the sun will not bleach it   
   nor the tide wash it away 
francoise 
she s just teasin  ya 
what are you talking about 
you don t speak french 
he speaks french 
in fact  even better than that  four 
   he is french

some girls like that in a man  but not
the sort of girls you wanna be with 
  is that right 
  come on  your last girlfriend chucked ya 
  it was not my fault 
  look at your thumbs  man 
  they re well defined 
  what does that mean 
you play a lot of video games 
that is a powerful index of incompatibility 
why do i get the feeling you re
trying to tell me something 
you haven t a hope  not a bleedin 
chicken s chance in thailand 
  know what i mean 
  thank you 
so  enjoy the beach
and cut the bullshit

excellent 
excellent attitude

oh  shit 
good work

take a drink 
richard 
yeah 
would you like to come
to the beach with me

yeah 
yeah    yeah  i i guess 
i mean  the beach  ya know 
it s just perfect 
do you think that i ignore you 
no 
but i do 
it s because i m with etienne 
it s difficult for me to
spend time with you 
i don t suppose that there s any   
you know  special reason that you should 
  spend time with me  that is 
  of course there is 
i like you 
a lot 
have you    have you
told this to etienne  or   
no 
it s our secret 
ok 
look  there  the plankton  shrimps 
when they re disturbed  they glow 
come on 
song  i m coming  not drowning 
  swimming closer to you  
  i m moving  
  i feel it  
  i m coming  not drowning  
  i m moving  i feel it  
  i m coming  not drowning  
  i m moving  i m coming  
  can you hear what i hear   
  it s calling you  my dear     
that night  we promised ourselves 
and we honestly believed   
   that no one would ever know 
  i wanna talk 
  about what 
about you and francoise 
whaddaya mean   
me and francoise 
i mean  richard   
    that i want her to be happy 
  yeah 
i mean  of course 
  we all do  right 
  shut up 
please shut the fuck up 
and if happy is with you   
   then i will not stand in her way 
etienne  man  i   
  i don t know what you re talking about 
  fuck you  richard  i know 
ok  i know 
everybody knows 
the problem is seeing the fish 
with the heavy rain
and the bad light   
   it s very difficult to catch them 
it can last for days 
sometimes   
   we get really hungry 
gimme that 
richard 
richard  richard 
come out 
i can t hear you 
and you can t hear me 
  shark 
  come 
shark 
ohh 
all right  all right 
all right  all right  all right 
shh 
now before i start  there s just a couple
of things you have to remember 
you have to remain calm 
right 
you have to show no fear 
  teach it  teach it 
  because the sharks   
you see  the sharks 
they can sense that fear 
just as easily as
they can sense blood 
and so it went for me 
just as i knew it would 
just as nature had ordained 
its    jaw wide open 
row upon row of these razor sharp teeth
glinting underwater like    jagged diamonds 
it s tail fin sweeping back and
forth as it surged in for the kill 
i swear to god   
   my whole life
flashed before my eyes 
really 
i had nothing left to offer
except for pure reflex 
pure reflex   
   and mankind s basic drive
for survival that somehow   
   shouts  no  i will not die today  
  yes 
  whoo 
at that instant  i knew
it was either the shark or me 
the shark knew it 
i knew it 
but jeez    god 
it s nothin  personal  right  it s just
the way the world works  it s nature 
but    if i remember correctly   
   in that last glimmer of its eyes   
   there was a moment between us   
   where it said  hey  richard  man  
 enjoy your dinner  
strange thing  killing a shark 
isn t it  richard 
it s just a big fish  bugs 
just a big fish 
yeah  maybe  maybe when it s just a baby
and it hasn t really learned to kill yet 
then maybe it s just a big fish 
but when it s a great white angry mother
with the taste of blood on its tongue   
   now that s a different story 
oh  god  jeez   
i m sorry  bugs 
is it just me 
or does this wet weather
make everyone so damn tired 
maybe we can hear your very different
and  i m sure  very interesting story   
   some other time  huh 
very interesting  keaty 
verlo interesantno 
molto interessante

  old pirates  yes  they rob i  
  sold i to the merchant ships  
  minutes after they took i  
  from the bottomless pit  
  and my hand was made strong  
  by the hand of the almighty  
  we forward in this generation  
  triumphantly  
  won t you help to sing  
  these songs of freedom   
  cos all i ever had  
  redemption song  
  redemption song  
argh 
after the funeral 
we all tried to get back to normal 
but it just didn t seem right 
    no steady job  
pretty soon it became clear
the problem was christo 
shut up 
you see  in a shark attack 
or any other major tragedy  i guess   
   the important thing is
to get eaten and die   
   in which case there s a funeral
and somebody makes a speech   
   and everybody says
what a good guy you were 
or get better   
   in which case everyone
can forget about it 
  i can t take this 
  christo  please 
   every two or three autumns  
great atmosphere
get better or die 
it s the hanging around in between
that really pisses people off 
listen to me 
you can t do this 
this is disgusting 
take him back 
  ok  just here 
  fucking animals 
what are you doing this for  huh 
tell me 
how can you do this 
richard 
fucking bastards 
bastards 
it would be a lot easier to condemn our
behaviour if it hadn t been so effective 
but out of sight   
   really was out of mind 
once he was gone   
   we felt a whole lot better 
on the beach 
it s easy to turn your back   
   but not always so easy to forget 
pay them in dollars  fuck their daughters 
and turn it into wonderland  richard 
richard  come with me 
is that  or is that not   
   a map she s holding 
and did you   
   or did you not   
   make that copy 
you know 
the lying doesn t bother me 
but that map   
   is trouble 
the farmers  right 
you remember  those men with guns 
they said to us  they told us   
    no more people  
and now it looks like we re
handing out fucking tour guides 
sal  i mean   
we could explain  right 
i mean  we could tell  em it was daffy 
we could explain  
i want you up here every day
until those people come 
  here 
  yes  here 
i want you to get the map back 
ok  whatever happens 
you get the map back 
w wait  sal 
  sal  they could be there for weeks 
  that s right 
  and you ll be here  waiting for them 
  what am i supposed to do when they come 
get the map 
you drew it  you handed it out 
now you get it back and turn them away 
sal  sal 
are you gonna tell
 em what else i did 
now this was truly a pain in the ass 
i didn t want these people to
come here anymore than sal did 
but what exactly did
she expect me to do 
chase them away  threaten them 
i mean  with what 
by the time these kids go there 
i d probably have starved to death 
sal 
  sal  is that you  get that light outta   
  you re a pig 
dammit  what the fuck was that for 
there s nothing i can do 
  i have to stay up here 
  not that  ok 
  what is it  then 
  you and sal in ko pha ngan 
oh  that 
yeah  that 
she has told everyone 
and me  i m the last one to find out 
at least she believes in honesty 
not like you 
i mean  francoise  i   
what    what can i say 
nothing  there s nothing you can say 
thank you
thank you for making
my life just perfect
super
god   
   dammit 
shit 
you are such an idiot 
even though i knew it would happen   
i was crushed 
and i guess i deserved it 
i coulda given her all
the excuses she wanted   
   but it wouldn t have
made any difference 
great great
at first  i thought i
was gonna die up here   
   that my entire world was gonna end 
but it didn t 
in fact   
pretty soon  i found that there were
plenty of other things to keep me occupied 
and before i knew it   
   i found that love  like grief   
   tends to fade away   
   and be replaced by
something more exciting 
and life up on the hill turned
out to be a big improvement 
i mean  up here 
i could do what ever i wanted 
there was no fishing duty 
no gardening shit 
no hassle from bugs or
etienne or francoise 
i was playing my own game now 
and i had absolutely
no reason to go back 
ok  so i was just foolin  around 
but the longer i stayed away from
the community    the less i missed them 
and i found new players 
even if they didn t know it yet 
this forest was my territory 
retrieving the map   
my mission 
and these   
   my defenders 
i was the only one
with the overview   
   of how it all fitted together 
the island 
me 
them 
the invaders 
all connected 
all playing the same game 
and at the centre of it all   
   one man 
   daffy 
inside 
take a look  richard

the big  chunky charlie s eating
up the whole world  out there 
down on the beach  down on
the street  pay them in dollars

no  no   
no  no 
c mon  hold on to me 
game over 
but she was never gonna leave 
she believed in it all
way too much to ever change 
so that s exactly where we left her 
  we sailed to the seven seas  
  searching for the missing key  
  unlocking you  
  the world s harmony  
  we climbed the highest
mountain range  
  then we took the longest day     
and as for the rest of us   
   we carried away our sins and made our way
back to wherever it was we called home   
   to pick up the pieces
of whatever was waiting 
of course  you can never forget
what you ve done 
but we adapt 
we carry on 
  the heat and rhythm
in the rivers run  
  and blinding faith in the desert sun  
  hear them today  
  play all as one  
  distant voices sang the far off sky  
  led us to that elusive prize  
  can i get you anything 
  no  thanks 
and me 
i still believe in paradise 
but now  at least i know
it s not some place you can look for 
because it s not where you go   
   it s how you feel for a moment in your
life when you re a part of something 
and if you find that moment   
   it lasts for ever 
  god knows  you re lonely souls  
  god knows  you re lonely souls  
  god knows  you re lonely souls  
  yeah  yeah  
  i believe there s a time and a place  
  to let your minds reflect  
  get out of this place  
  i believe there s a day and a place  
  that we will go to  
  and i know you wanna share  
  there s no secret to living  
  there s no secret to living  
  just keep on walking  
  there s no secret to dying  
  there s no secret to dying  
  just keep on flying  
  i m gonna die in a place  
  that don t know my name  
  i m gonna die in a space  
  that don t hold my name  
  oooh ooh  
  walking in the cold  
  just keep on flying  
  god knows  you re lonely souls  
  god knows  you re lonely souls  
  god knows  you re lonely souls
