kim ja hyun s body was found
deeply stabbed in the neck 
the brutality of the murder
with no valuables missing
led the police to suspect that
the motive was a personal grudge 
her husband who disappeared a year ago
is now on the wanted list 
according to neighbors
the missing husband  oh dae su 
drank often  causing trouble
with his wife and the neighbors 
blood found at the scene
matched oh dae su s 
fresh fingerprints were found
from a cup at the crime scene 
proving that oh dae su recently visited 
according to the police 
a missing family album  the only
stolen item also backs their theories 
after three years
many wrinkles have formed on his face 
  that is around  61 000
  for a sushi knife  
 right always prevails 
if you stand aimlessly
at a phone booth on a rainy day
and meet a man whose face
is hidden under a purple umbrella 
i d suggest that you get close to the tv 
   a listening device  
the television is both
a clock and a calendar 
it s your school  home  church 
friend
and lover 
but   
countless nights may puss
but my heart is turned to you
though i may shed my sad tears
it s still your face that i miss
but   
my lover s song
is too short 
this morning around 7 50
the sungsoo bridge
in seoul suddenly
collapsed in the middle 
i wrote about all the people
i fought  tormented  and hurt 
this was both my prison journal
and an autobiography of my evil deeds 
i thought i had lived an average life
but i ve sinned so much 
all i could think about
at that moment was
the poor guy next door is eating
with only one chopstick 
but   
but   
who locked me up here 
yoo heung sam 
lee so young or kang chang suk 
whoever it was  just wait 
wait just a bit 
from the top of your head
down to the tips of your toes
no one will be able to find
any trace of your body on this earth 
because i m going
to chew up every last piece of it 
one line for one year 
for this first time
i have to ink in six lines 
it will be easier from next year 
the more the tattoos
the shorter gets the chopstick 
the shorter gets the chopstick
the bigger gets the hole in the watt 
anyway

hey mister  wake up   
keep this in mind 
be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same 
you re awake 
is this true 
that fever medicine
really works 
you fainted so easy for
someone who exercised so much 
lack of sunlight over a long time leads
to deficiencies in vitamins a and e 
hence my lack of immunity
against the influenza

the bathroom door is broken
and doesn t lock 
don t get any ideas 
i could slice you like sashimi

suppositories 
how else could i feed medicine
to someone who s fainted

when it actually comes to
the critical moment  i may resist 
but show no mercy 
just give it to me 
give it to you 
the ants   
do they still come out 
do you still feel them 
when it comes to loneliness
it s always the ants 
the really lonely people i met
they all hallucinated ants

come to think about it   
you know how ants always
move in groups 
so i suppose the real lonely people
keep imagining ants 
of course  i never did myself

free yourself 
  close quote 
  who are you 
who are you  you rotten bastard 
i had decided while i was locked up 
that i wouldn t trust
anyone if i get out 
that if i find anyone to be suspicious
i would create a secret which
only that person and i will know 
the messenger id   monster 
is a trap that i made to catch you 
you bring a complete stronger home 
who are you 
who is evergreen 
i tracked down that id  evergreen 
and found out the personal details 
  ready to jot it down 
  go ahead
the name is su dee ah 
ever heard that surname   su  
  address 
  it s in eung am 
saewoon apartments
building 7  unit 407 
i m not doing fine
in this life in a bigger prison 
 evergreen  
 who are you  
you were going to
say that  right 
no  you must find out on your own 
come on  it s a game 
first  who 
then  why 
once you solve the questions
come see me anytime 
i ll mark the answers for you 
you have until july 5th 
only five days left 
too short 
do your best  if you pass
i ll kill myself instead of mi do 
that s right  mi do 
i m going to kill every woman
you love until you die 
you re notorious for not being
able to protect your women 
wow  you re strong 
mr  monster 
you truly are the monster
of my creation 
but this way  you won t
ever find out the  why  
the question that bugged you
for the last 15 years 
you don t care anymore 
take that seat 
ah  the dental torture 
you won t get enough time
to torture me 
i have a weak heart
so i have this motor inside 
when it was put in
do you know what i said to the doctor 
doctor hopkins
gave me a remote control
that can switch the motor off 
pardon  why 
so i can kill myself easily
any time i want 
i ll give you a 100 grand more 
oh  what a conundrum 
you wan t to kill me right away 
but you won t find out
why you were locked up 
you want to torture me but
i say i ll kill myself first 
to get your revenge
or to find out the reason 
oh  that is the big question 
i ve been watching you
for 15 years 
i fared well thanks to you 
i wasn t bored or lonely 
seeking revenge is the best cure
for the ones who were hurt 
try it 
the loss of 15 years 
the pain of losing your wife and child 
all these would go away 
in other words
vengeance is healthy 
but what happens after
you ve fulfilled your vengeance 
i bet that hidden pain
will probably come back again 
 are you there
mr  oh dae su  
 mr  oh dae su
long time no see  
hasn t she been tied up for too long 
i think you also left the door open 
please save me 
i need saving myself 
rudolph the red nosed reindeer

cowardice comes from imagination 
so try not to imagine 
it ll make you fucking brave

let s fight 
let s fight 
tenacious 
your hand 
i m going to cut off your hand 
you touched mi do s breasts 
then what about my tongue 
you still don t trust me
you rotten bastard 
i don t think we ll
reach an agreement
i looked into it
and their reason for not paying
more than 270 million
wasn t to do with
the evaluation of this building 
it s likely that their
convertible bonds holders are   
so i think there won t be a big issue 
of course  there s the 25 percent stake
held by their chairman and his relatives 
dae su 
yeah 
did he really say
that he ll kill me 
yeah 
because i am
a woman you love 
dae su 
what 
i wonder where my love is 
the night is getting lonelier 
the words we spoke with our eyes
can be felt with these hands
countless nights may pass
but my heart is turned to you 
though i may shed my sad tears
it s still your face that i miss
they packed up and left in a rental car 
mi do called the restaurant and quit 
let s go after this is done 
you should get some rest today 
i have insomnia anyway 
 the night is getting lonelier  
mr  han  do you really think
mi do has fallen in love
with oh dae su 
already 
dae su  it really hurts 
but i m enduring it 
i want you to know that 
how did you hold out 
for 15 years 
there s always a way 
do you like it 
you really like it  right 
i want to be good to you 
do not worry about the future 
don t imagine anything 
i feel thankful for
all those years in that prison 
if i was still my old self
would mi do have liked me like this 
the fact that he knew i wanted to
cut off park s hand means
he s planted a bug on us 
he knew where we were by tailing us 
 i ve been bugged 
please find it  
maybe  he let you go 
because he has fun watching you
run wild seeking revenge 
never telling you why 
toying with you forever 
could that be it

there was a huge rumor at the school
that she fucked anyone and everyone 
i should ve gotten in there

that she was such a slut

  where are you going 
  going on a date with choon shim 
you re dead meat
if you tell anyone 
no way 
you get locked up for 15 years
just for saying that 
was that such a big sin 
be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same 
that s what lee woo jin believes 
then what s special about
july 5th 
that s the day
lee soo ah died 
it s over then 
you said it s not about vengeance
but finding out why he locked you up 
now we ll run away where
he can never find us  right 
i can t end it like this 
vengeance has now
become a part of me 
but you don t even know
where he lives 
like a gazelle from
the hand of the hunter
like a bird from the snare of the fowler
free yourself 
it s from the proverbs chapter 6 verse 4 
 proverbs  is another word for  maxim  
and evergreen said
he lives in a high tower 
so chapter 6 verse 4
must mean the floor numbers 
fourth floor  sixth floor 
or the sixty fourth floor 
p 
penthouse 
please press the passcode 
what would you like me to pray for 
wrong entry  please press again 
wrong entry  please press again 
 dear lord 
please let me meet
a younger man next time  
please make lee woo jin
kneel down to dae su
and beg him for mercy 
you slept with your sister 
let s go up and talk 
get him 
let s talk it out 
feels great 
you slept with your sister 
so refreshing 
and i started the rumors 
that s why your sister died 
looking through the mirror
reminds me of that day  same for you 
how unfair of you to erase my memory
and then to tell me to find it 
i won  so
die like you promised 
you think you couldn t remember that day
because you were hypnotized  really 
do you know the real reason
why you couldn t remember 
let me tell you 
you just forgot 
is that a letdown 
but it s true
you simply forgot 
why 
because it wasn t your business 
your rumor grew to the point where
they were saying soo ah got pregnant 
my sister got sucked into that rumor
and in the end  began to believe it 
then  her period actually stopped
and her belly began to swell 
amazing  isn t it 
ever thought about the girl  pregnant
with a child who s also her nephew 
understand now 
your tongue got my sister pregnant 
it wasn t lee woo jin s dick 
it was oh dae su s tongue 
is that why you killed your sister 
i thought about the boy  about to
father a child who s also his nephew 
you were probably afraid 
afraid that everyone will find out
once the baby s born 
when you realized that it was all just
her imagination after you killed her  
how you must have hated me 
it s understandable 
they say soo ah died alone at the dam
but who took this photo 
what about this date  july 5th 
this is no fun 
i ll just finish what i was telling you 
listen carefully  my story is really fun 
ever heard of post hypnotic suggestion 
you suggest something during hypnosis
and then it s acted out
in your awakened state 
still haven t figured if out 
you bring a complete stranger home
who are you 
who are you  you rotten bastard 
we hypnotized you both 
one very fortunate thing
was that you both were
highly receptive to hypnosis
compared to average people 
isn t this fun 
one word gets you pregnant 
one word gets you in love 
but no matter how much you two
are receptive to hypnosis
or no matter how good
a hypnotist ms  yoo is 
getting people to
fall in love isn t easy 
so do you know what we did 
  oh that 
  your first suggestion  of course 
was to go to that restaurant
as soon as you were released 
next  to react to the specific
melody from the cell phone 
when you hear the melody
you were to say certain words 
who are you 
do you like your clothes 
to the man who says those words
mi do was to perform a certain action 
when she grabs your hand
your reaction was to be  of course   
your true mistake was not
failing to find the answer 
you kept asking the wrong question
so how could you find the right answer 
it s not
 why did lee woo jin lock me up  
it s  why did he let me go  
once again 
why did lee woo jin release
oh dae su after just
15 years 
 laugh  and the world laughs with you 
weep  and you will weep alone  
mr  han 
mister han 
mi do   
mi do doesn t know  right 
why did you hide her there 
you thought he d hate me
because i cut off his hand 
didn t you stop to think
maybe it was a trap 
how can you protect your woman
with that brain of yours 
i ve been secretly protecting mi do
since she was three 
but what about you 
mr  park s hand 
you imbecile 
know that new prison of his 
he said he had to move 
so i gave him that building
in payment for his hand 
dae su 
there s a box here 
it s that some violet box 
he s telling me to open it 
no 
no  mi do  don t 
don t open it no matter what 
if you open it
something terrible will happen 
what s in it 
you know  don t you 
mi do  my sweet pea
wait a bit longer 
i ll be there very soon 
can t you come right now 
i m scared 
my sweet pea  you can wait for me 
yes

i ll call you very soon  okay 
i beg you 
please don t tell mi do 
what has she done wrong 
you know it was all my fault 
i have   
i have committed a terrible sin
to your sister 
and i was very wrong to you 
so please leave mi do alone  okay 
if mi do finds out the truth 
you asshole 
from the top of your head
down to the tips of your toes 
no one will be able to find any trace
of your body on this earth  why 
because i m going to
chew up every last piece of it 
woo jin 
mr  lee woo jin
i made a mistake 
please forget what i said 
sir  boss 
woo jin 
we re evergreen old boys
remember 
with the energy from the green pine tree 
the great sangnok high   
i ll do whatever you want 
i ll do anything 
i beg you 
woo jin  if you want me
to be a dog  i will 
i m woo jin s dog from now on 
i m your puppy 
look  i m wagging my tail 
i m a dog 
i ll guard your house 
i ll be your slave dog 
the box   
just leave it closed 
now 
what joy will i live for 
dae su 
it really hurts 
but i m enduring it 
i want you to know that 
how did you hold out  for 15 years 
my sister and i knew everything
but still loved each other 
can you two do the same 
dae su  do you like it 
i want to be good to you 
soo ah 
woo jin 
i know you ve been scared 
so let go of me  okay 
remember me  alright 
i have no regrets 
do you 
up until this point is
the whole story of my adventure 
thank you gor listening to
this terrible story to the end 
i hope you now understand
me sending a letter
instead of talking to you in person 
this is because i have no tongue 
to be honest
i have no reason to help you 
but you see 
i was touched
by this lust sentence 
 even though i m no better than a beast 
don t i have the right to live  
but the hypnosis may go wrong
and mess up your memories 
will that be okay 
once you re ready 
stare at that tree 
the tree is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar 
you re now inside
lee woo jin s penthouse 
it s a dreary night 
the sound of your footsteps to the window
echoes through the room 
when i ring my bell 
you ll be split into two persons 
the one who doesn t know the secret
is named  oh dae su  
the one who keeps the secret
is named  the monster  
when i ring my bell again 
the monster will turn around
and begin walking 
with each step he will age by one year 
when the monster reaches 70 he will die 
there s no need to worry 
it will be a very peaceful death 
good luck
