kim jahyuns body was found
deeply stabbed in the neck
the brutality of the murder
with no valuables missing
led the police to suspect that
the motive was a personal grudge
her husband who disappeared a year ago
is now on the wanted list
according to neighbors
the missing husband oh daesu
drank often causing trouble
with his wife and the neighbors
blood found at the scene
matched oh daesus
fresh fingerprints were found
from a cup at the crime scene
proving that oh daesu recently visited
according to the police
a missing family album the only
stolen item also backs their theories
after three years
many wrinkles have formed on his face
that is around 61000
for a sushi knife
right always prevails
if you stand aimlessly
at a phone booth on a rainy day
and meet a man whose face
is hidden under a purple umbrella
id suggest that you get close to the tv
a listening device
the television is both
a clock and a calendar
its your school home church
friend
and lover
but
countless nights may puss
but my heart is turned to you
though i may shed my sad tears
its still your face that i miss
but
my lovers song
is too short
this morning around 750
the sungsoo bridge
in seoul suddenly
collapsed in the middle
i wrote about all the people
i fought tormented and hurt
this was both my prison journal
and an autobiography of my evil deeds
i thought i had lived an average life
but ive sinned so much
all i could think about
at that moment was
the poor guy next door is eating
with only one chopstick
but
but
who locked me up here
yoo heungsam
lee soyoung or kang changsuk
whoever it was just wait
wait just a bit
from the top of your head
down to the tips of your toes
no one will be able to find
any trace of your body on this earth
because im going
to chew up every last piece of it
one line for one year
for this first time
i have to ink in six lines
it will be easier from next year
the more the tattoos
the shorter gets the chopstick
the shorter gets the chopstick
the bigger gets the hole in the watt
anyway
time passes well

10 years of imaginary training

tenaciously when caught
in south kyoungsang province
its offspring

i dont know a thing
pardon
i said i want to eat something alive
oh right

where have we met
the search for the best chefs

the youngest female
japanese cuisine chef in korea

loo heungsam

i must be different from other women
my hands are very cold
whats with her
sir
hold on
hey mister wake up
keep this in mind
be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same
youre awake
is this true
that fever medicine
really works
you fainted so easy for
someone who exercised so much
lack of sunlight over a long time leads
to deficiencies in vitamins a and e
hence my lack of immunity
against the influenza
do you usually talk that way
the bathroom door is broken
and doesnt lock
dont get any ideas
i could slice you like sashimi
whats this
suppositories
how else could i feed medicine
to someone whos fainted
15 years of imaginary training
is it any use in real life
it isnt
i deserve to die for that
i bring you here only to deny you
i get why youre angry
i admit it
i brought you here
because i like you too but
you dont even know my name
im mido
you know
later when i feel im ready
then we do it
scouts honor
that song the face i miss
in your journal thats the sign
when i sing it
get yourself ready right away
when it actually comes to
the critical moment i may resist
but show no mercy
just give it to me
give it to you
the ants
do they still come out
do you still feel them
when it comes to loneliness
its always the ants
the really lonely people i met
they all hallucinated ants
even if just for a second
come to think about it
you know how ants always
move in groups
so i suppose the real lonely people
keep imagining ants
of course i never did myself
she called from overseas

a bastard you hate

a bitch you detest
but want more than to kill
well take care of them
dont they go mad
being locked up for so long
if you prefer that he doesnt
we can administer some medication
theres this one called
risperdal solution
its known to be a reliable
treatment for schizophrenia
the duration is always the issue
how long are you thinking of
15 years
too long
what did he do wrong
oh daesu you see
talks too much
go to sleep
its about time you visited joohwans
internet cafe tomorrow
sit wherever youd like
joohwan
oh daesu you see

i dont know all the 260 names
of your womens husbands
mido princess sashimi
whos mido
this girl who cries over nothing
joohwan
did i really talk that much
doesu the way i see it
you should look for the perpetrator
among those who used to be
in your close proximity
search for friends evergreen
over 50 search results
evergreen invites you
to be online friends
as of yesterday statute of limitations
has expired for oh daesu
but please remember
open quote
like a gazelle from
the hand of the hunter
like a bird from
the snare of the fowler
free yourself
close quote
who are you
who are you you rotten bastard
i had decided while i was locked up
that i wouldnt trust
anyone if i get out
that if i find anyone to be suspicious
i would create a secret which
only that person and i will know
the messenger id monster
is a trap that i made to catch you
you bring a complete stronger home
who are you
who is evergreen
i tracked down that id evergreen
and found out the personal details
ready to jot it down
go ahead
the name is su deeah
ever heard that surname su
address
its in eungam
saewoon apartments
building 7 unit 407
im not doing fine
in this life in a bigger prison
evergreen
who are you
you were going to
say that right
no you must find out on your own
come on its a game
first who
then why
once you solve the questions
come see me anytime
ill mark the answers for you
you have until july 5th
only five days left
too short
do your best if you pass
ill kill myself instead of mido
thats right mido
im going to kill every woman
you love until you die
youre notorious for not being
able to protect your women
wow youre strong
mr monster
you truly are the monster
of my creation
but this way you wont
ever find out the why
the question that bugged you
for the last 15 years
you dont care anymore
take that seat
ah the dental torture
you wont get enough time
to torture me
i have a weak heart
so i have this motor inside
when it was put in
do you know what i said to the doctor
doctor hopkins
gave me a remote control
that can switch the motor off
pardon why
so i can kill myself easily
any time i want
ill give you a 100 grand more
oh what a conundrum
you want to kill me right away
but you wont find out
why you were locked up
you want to torture me but
i say ill kill myself first
to get your revenge
or to find out the reason
oh that is the big question
ive been watching you
for 15 years
i fared well thanks to you
i wasnt bored or lonely
seeking revenge is the best cure
for the ones who were hurt
try it
the loss of 15 years
the pain of losing your wife and child
all these would go away
in other words
vengeance is healthy
but what happens after
youve fulfilled your vengeance
i bet that hidden pain
will probably come back again
are you there
mr oh daesu
mr oh daesu
long time no see
hasnt she been tied up for too long
i think you also left the door open
please save me
i need saving myself
rudolph the red nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
this dentist is really good
dont move
whats with you
now
here we go
you know they say that
cowardice comes from imagination
so try not to imagine
itll make you fucking brave
now here comes the real thing
yes
well sir i do thank you for
telling me about this place
but i havent even started
what
lets go
lets really go
lets fight
lets fight
tenacious
your hand
im going to cut off your hand
you touched midos breasts
then what about my tongue
you still dont trust me
you rotten bastard
i dont think well
reach an agreement
i looked into it
and their reason for not paying
more than 270 million
wasnt to do with
the evaluation of this building
its likely that their
convertible bonds holders are
so i think there wont be a big issue
of course theres the 25 percent stake
held by their chairman and his relatives
daesu
yeah
did he really say
that hell kill me
yeah
because i am
a woman you love
daesu
what
i wonder where my love is
the night is getting lonelier
the words we spoke with our eyes
can be felt with these hands
countless nights may pass
but my heart is turned to you
though i may shed my sad tears
its still your face that i miss
they packed up and left in a rental car
mido called the restaurant and quit
lets go after this is done
you should get some rest today
i have insomnia anyway
the night is getting lonelier
mr han do you really think
mido has fallen in love
with oh daesu
already
daesu it really hurts
but im enduring it
i want you to know that
how did you hold out
for 15 years
theres always a way
do you like it
you really like it right
i want to be good to you
do not worry about the future
dont imagine anything
i feel thankful for
all those years in that prison
if i was still my old self
would mido have liked me like this
the fact that he knew i wanted to
cut off parks hand means
hes planted a bug on us
he knew where we were by tailing us
ive been bugged
please find it
maybe he let you go
because he has fun watching you
run wild seeking revenge
never telling you why
toying with you forever
could that be it

records of class 79
its dark so turn on the lights
take your time
joohwan
let me ask you something
do you know
lee woojin of class 79
i think he went to
america to study
lee woofin
dont know him is that his name
how did you find out
looked through all the yearbooks
and found his face
i wouldnt know him just by his name
scissorhands hair salon
got anything else
like the school records
do you know lee sooah
she was in our year
lee sooah she died
what class was she in
homeroom two she was in my class
next to yours what about her
but why is there
no photo because she was dead
how did sooah die
thats right you wouldnt know
she died after you transferred
she went alone to the habchun dam
fell into the river and drowned
a week later they found
her bloated body in the water
what was she like
her
she was a total slut
acting like a prude on the outside
but a filthy whore on the inside
there was a huge rumor at the school
that she fucked anyone and everyone
i shouldve gotten in there
anyway her family was super rich
her grades were really good too
but the crucial thing was
that she was such a slut
this is such an old story
daesu i dont remember tfoo well
since it was so long ago
but that sooah
wait didnt you also
hey whats going on joohwan
joohwan
whats happening
joohwan
mr oh daesu
my sister wasnt a slut
i really want you to know that
because you got rid of all the bugs
i had to come all the way here
to listen in
so mr roh joohwan
died because of you okay
you son of a bitch
im going to kill you
i am going to rip you
into little pieces
motherfucker
were not open yet
please come back in an hour
a man who got six gold teeth here
recommended this place
mr park
i had to move because of you
to celebrate
i bought some new tvs do you like it
there are so many channels
exciting huh
some of them even
refuse to leave
you lived in a place like this
for 15 years
got used to it after 11 years
come on i dont need money
an enemys enemy is a friend
we threw away the hand
because it rotted
my wife will be happy
damn sons of bitches
i want to kick their asses
so why did you bring me here
let me go
if i dont return after july 5th
then let her go
while i was locked up
i remember someone visiting me
what did that person do
was it three times
i put a hypnosisinducing
drug in your water
sodium barbiturate
tv man knows if all
daesu
scissorhands hair solon
thats nonsense
even though it was a catholic school
i doubt she killed herself
because of those rumors
there probably was
another reason
like she got pregnant
or something
but i dont think sooah
really was a slut
she was such a
neat and tidy girl
she wouldnt put out
for just anyone
there must have been a guy
she was going out with
so who was that guy
well i wouldnt know
choonshim
you knew lee sooah right
who was her boyfriend
dont know
shut the hell up
what would you know
about friendship
shut your trap then whod know
who
joohwan
what
yeah i know him
but how would he know
yeah really
okay hang up
ill call you in a bit
choonshim says joohwan
had told her about it
and says that
you would know the best
ring ring move aside
youll get hurt if you hesitate
oh daesu
look at you put it out
im transferring today to seoul
so butt out miss kim
you goodfornothing
youre oh daesu right
and youre miss
i heard youre popular
among the girls
you know how rumors are
i heard youre really funny
say something funny
being stuck with one image
isnt healthy but
theres this father and son
they went to the public bath
see you later
take care
homeroom three fuckheads
come on
wait
come here
no
hurry and come here
okay okay
satisfied
raise this up
no way
raise it
no
what
it tickles
give it here
what are you doing
let me see
see what
let me see
stop
go away
was it really sooah
you sure
i dont know her name
all i know is that shes in your class
and she rides a red bike
have a good trip
see you in seoul if i go
where are you going
going on a date with choonshim
youre dead meat
if you tell anyone
no way
you get locked up for 15 years
just for saying that
was that such a big sin
be it a grain of sand or a rock
in water they sink the same
thats what lee woojin believes
then whats special about
july 5th
thats the day
lee sooah died
its over then
you said its not about vengeance
but finding out why he locked you up
now well run away where
he can never find us right
i cant end it like this
vengeance has now
become a part of me
but you dont even know
where he lives
like a gazelle from
the hand of the hunter
like a bird from the snare of the fowler
free yourself
its from the proverbs chapter 6 verse 4
proverbs is another word for maxim
and evergreen said
he lives in a high tower
so chapter 6 verse 4
must mean the floor numbers
fourth floor sixth floor
or the sixtyfourth floor
p
penthouse
please press the passcode
what would you like me to pray for
wrong entry please press again
wrong entry please press again
dear lord
please let me meet
a younger man next time
please make lee woojin
kneel down to daesu
and beg him for mercy
you slept with your sister
lets go up and talk
get him
lets talk it out
feels great
you slept with your sister
so refreshing
and i started the rumors
thats why your sister died
looking through the mirror
reminds me of that day same for you
how unfair of you to erase my memory
and then to tell me to find it
i won so
die like you promised
you think you couldnt remember that day
because you were hypnotized really
do you know the real reason
why you couldnt remember
let me tell you
you just forgot
is that a letdown
but its true
you simply forgot
why
because it wasnt your business
your rumor grew to the point where
they were saying sooah got pregnant
my sister got sucked into that rumor
and in the end began to believe it
then her period actually stopped
and her belly began to swell
amazing isnt it
ever thought about the girl pregnant
with a child whos also her nephew
understand now
your tongue got my sister pregnant
it wasnt lee woojins dick
it was oh daesus tongue
is that why you killed your sister
i thought about the boy about to
father a child whos also his nephew
you were probably afraid
afraid that everyone will find out
once the babys born
when you realized that it was all just
her imagination after you killed her
how you must have hated me
its understandable
they say sooah died alone at the dam
but who took this photo
what about this date july 5th
this is no fun
ill just finish what i was telling you
listen carefully my story is really fun
ever heard of posthypnotic suggestion
you suggest something during hypnosis
and then its acted out
in your awakened state
still havent figured if out
you bring a complete stranger home
who are you
who are you you rotten bastard
we hypnotized you both
one very fortunate thing
was that you both were
highly receptive to hypnosis
compared to average people
isnt this fun
one word gets you pregnant
one word gets you in love
but no matter how much you two
are receptive to hypnosis
or no matter how good
a hypnotist ms yoo is
getting people to
fall in love isnt easy
so do you know what we did
oh that
your first suggestion of course
was to go to that restaurant
as soon as you were released
next to react to the specific
melody from the cell phone
when you hear the melody
you were to say certain words
who are you
do you like your clothes
to the man who says those words
mido was to perform a certain action
when she grabs your hand
your reaction was to be of course
your true mistake was not
failing to find the answer
you kept asking the wrong question
so how could you find the right answer
its not
why did lee woojin lock me up
its why did he let me go
once again
why did lee woojin release
oh daesu after just
15 years
laugh and the world laughs with you
weep and you will weep alone
mr han
mister han
mido
mido doesnt know right
why did you hide her there
you thought hed hate me
because i cut off his hand
didnt you stop to think
maybe it was a trap
how can you protect your woman
with that brain of yours
ive been secretly protecting mido
since she was three
but what about you
mr parks hand
you imbecile
know that new prison of his
he said he had to move
so i gave him that building
in payment for his hand
daesu
theres a box here
its that some violet box
hes telling me to open it
no
no mido dont
dont open it no matter what
if you open it
something terrible will happen
whats in it
you know dont you
mido my sweet pea
wait a bit longer
ill be there very soon
cant you come right now
im scared
my sweet pea you can wait for me

i have committed a terrible sin
to your sister
and i was very wrong to you
so please leave mido alone okay
if mido finds out the truth
you asshole
from the top of your head
down to the tips of your toes
no one will be able to find any trace
of your body on this earth why
because im going to
chew up every last piece of it
woojin
mr lee woojin
i made a mistake
please forget what i said
sir boss
woojin
were evergreen old boys
remember
with the energy from the green pine tree
the great sangnok high
ill do whatever you want
ill do anything
i beg you
woojin if you want me
to be a dog i will
im woojins dog from now on
im your puppy
look im wagging my tail
im a dog
ill guard your house
ill be your slave dog
the box
just leave it closed
now
what joy will i live for
daesu
it really hurts
but im enduring it
i want you to know that
how did you hold out for 15 years
my sister and i knew everything
but still loved each other
can you two do the same
daesu do you like it
i want to be good to you
sooah
woojin
i know youve been scared
so let go of me okay
remember me alright
i have no regrets
do you
up until this point is
the whole story of my adventure
thank you gor listening to
this terrible story to the end
i hope you now understand
me sending a letter
instead of talking to you in person
this is because i have no tongue
to be honest
i have no reason to help you
but you see
i was touched
by this lust sentence
even though im no better than a beast
dont i have the right to live
but the hypnosis may go wrong
and mess up your memories
will that be okay
once youre ready
stare at that tree
the tree is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar
youre now inside
lee woojins penthouse
its a dreary night
the sound of your footsteps to the window
echoes through the room
when i ring my bell
youll be split into two persons
the one who doesnt know the secret
is named oh daesu
the one who keeps the secret
is named the monster
when i ring my bell again
the monster will turn around
and begin walking
with each step he will age by one year
when the monster reaches 70 he will die
theres no need to worry
it will be a very peaceful death
good luck
