like this spoil the party 
conga line 
conga  conga 
don t worry about me  fred 
  i ve been working in that quarry
since it was eight feet deep 
  atta boy 
there could be a whole new world
opening up for me 
  maybe i ll take in that
franchise show this weekend 
  that s the spirit 
there s just one thing
i gotta know 
after all these years 
how come they re canning me 
barn 
you re a wonderful father 
a loving husband 
a hard worker 
and one heck of a little bowler 
but  barn  none of that counts
on an aptitude test 
you got the lowest score  pal 
the lowest score 
wilma  that is beautiful 
  well  i have always wanted   
  you can t catch me 
  a halstone original 
  mmm 
  ohh 
  now  wilma  don t be silly 
if it means laying off
all those workers 
some have been here
since the beginning of time 
what if i could
quadruple your income 
i ll miss them 
you were saying 
sorry i m late 
i had car trouble 
picked up a nail 
thank you for sharing that 
mr  flagstone 
  f  
  may we continue 
mr  slate  gentlemen 
i have    a vision 
while our competitors
are mired in the stone age 
i give you   
the future 
  ohh 
  slate and company   
will revolutionize
the building industry   
by providing simple 
low cost 
modular housing units 
impossible  you say 
let me demonstrate 
through the miracle
of geothermal power 
the raw material is elevated to
the second stage 
  where our steam powered
conveyor belt carries  
  steam 
he s a madman 
steam powered
conveyor belts   
carry the product to be shaped 
cleaned  inspected   
and delivered to
discerning consumers worldwide 
and did i mention increasing
our profit margin   
  fourfold 
  very impressive  mr  vandercave 
very impressive  i think we should
implement this system immediately 
yes 
excuse me  mr  slate 
i know i m the new man here 
but i don t think you hired me
to sit around and look pretty 
i hate to bust your bubble 
but if you build houses this small 
who s gonna live in  em 
  excuse me  mrs  rubble 
  yes 
there seems to be a slight problem
with your credit card 
really 
and what would that be 
it s no damn good 
i have never been so embarrassed
in my entire life 
  go and play  children 
  wilma  i promise you i ll pay you back 
  i just don t know when 
  oh  now  betty 
  it can t be as bad as all that 
  but it is 
barney s still out of work 
we ve nearly spent all of our savings 
and  wilma  what if
the adoption agency finds out 
i don t want to
lose my baby 
i swear  betty  fred and i
would never let that happen 
  oh  wilma 
  oh  betty 
pterodactyl alert 
mommy  help 
  oh  yuck 
  ecch 
and in conclusion 
mr  slate 
i feel a paid vacation for everyone
in the quarry would raise morale   
and increase productivity 
um  um   
a whole bunch 
sincerely yours 
frederick j  flintstone

hey  fred 
what s two and two 
i didn t come here to talk business

with the guy that got the lowest score 
  think about it  fred

  this has gone far enough 
after everything that we ve done
for you  we took you into our home 
yeah  so you could show off
every chance you got 
you used to be such
nice people  but now   
you re just a couple of
rich snobs
