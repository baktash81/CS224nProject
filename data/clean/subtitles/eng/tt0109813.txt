maybe ill take in that
franchise show this weekend
thats the spirit
theres just one thing
i gotta know
after all these years
how come theyre canning me
barn
youre a wonderful father
a loving husband
a hard worker
and one heck of a little bowler
but barn none of that counts
on an aptitude test
you got the lowest score pal
the lowest score
wilma that is beautiful
well i have always wanted
you cant catch me
a halstone original
mmm
ohh
now wilma dont be silly
if it means laying off
all those workers
some have been here
since the beginning of time
what if i could
quadruple your income
ill miss them
you were saying
sorry im late
i had car trouble
picked up a nail
thank you for sharing that
mr flagstone
f
may we continue
mr slate gentlemen
i have a vision
while our competitors
are mired in the stone age
i give you
the future
ohh
slate and company
will revolutionize
the building industry
by providing simple
lowcost
modular housing units
impossible you say
let me demonstrate
through the miracle
of geothermal power
the raw material is elevated to
the second stage
where our steampowered
conveyor belt carries
steam
hes a madman
steampowered
conveyor belts
carry the product to be shaped
cleaned inspected
and delivered to
discerning consumers worldwide
and did i mention increasing
our profit margin
fourfold
very impressive mr vandercave
very impressive i think we should
implement this system immediately
yes
excuse me mr slate
i know im the new man here
but i dont think you hired me
to sit around and look pretty
i hate to bust your bubble
but if you build houses this small
whos gonna live in em
excuse me mrs rubble
yes
there seems to be a slight problem
with your credit card
really
and what would that be
its no damn good
i have never been so embarrassed
in my entire life
go and play children
wilma i promise you ill pay you back
i just dont know when
oh now betty
it cant be as bad as all that
but it is
barneys still out of work
weve nearly spent all of our savings
and wilma what if
the adoption agency finds out
i dont want to
lose my baby
i swear betty fred and i
would never let that happen
oh wilma
oh betty
pterodactyl alert
mommy help
oh yuck
ecch
and in conclusion
mr slate

in the quarry would raise morale
and increase productivity
um um

a better idea

turn ourselves in
then we can rot in jail
until the poles freeze over
i was just thinking
stick to your strengths
miss stone
and ill stick to mine
besides
if mr flintstone insists
on being so conscientious
perhaps we can give fred
something to take his mind
off work hmm
a bonus
thats right fred
you deserve it
