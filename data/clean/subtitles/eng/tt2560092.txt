for a bouquet of lilies either
lavaughn mm
when i stood on that stage
facing all of you
your disbelief
crowd booing
magician sighs
it it made my heart break
even now you see magic right before you
things conjured from nothing
meows
granted a fractured magic
sloppy accidental but
magic
to which you respond stop
as you would to some minor nuisance
what has happened here
that night i tried to cast a spell
on you and everyone else there
a spell to make you believe again
to care about magic
because extraordinary things are possible
if you believe
but i had no business
attempting such a powerful spell
because im not a very good magician
cat meows
i tried for mystery and wonderment
sighs it brought disaster
insects chirping
elephant groans
i know
i know youre worried
about the countess laughing
but ive got a great joke
and ive got it under control
you gotta trust me
snuffles and trumpets softly
hey laughs
i feel like youre not taking me
seriously im a dangerous man
i beat a giant i jumped off a building
blows
okay okay therell be plenty of time
for messing about later

on the final task but

breathes deeply
king now if at any point
i hear the countess laugh

crowd applauds
exhales

chuckles
chuckles
so theres a farmer and a fisherman
theyre out in a field together
solid start classic
when they hear
a funny kind of croaking noise
they look over towards the pond
and they see a hen
the hens got this piece of string
and shes working the string
in and out of the mouth
of a frog by the pond
up and down with the string
in the frogs mouth
so the fisherman says
why do you think the hens doing that
the farmer turns
to the fisherman and says
well sure its the same question
as always isnt it
chuckles
huh huh
why did the chicken floss the toad
crowd groans
laughs nailed it
funny stuff peter funny stuff
crowd sighs
sighs
groans
oh i get it
why did the chicken
because it sounds like
laughs forcefully

if youre not gonna take this seriously
countess then whats the point
sorry kid you failed
crowd groaning
oh peter
elephant sighs
no
what no
you have to let me take her
but not for me for her
elephant groans
all this time ive tried to win
the elephant to find my family
but she has a family
and she was taken from them
peter what about your sister
the elephant might have a sister too
why is mine more important
i know the joke didnt work
but please the elephant didnt ask
to be brought here
we have to send her home
no no no no no no
man you almost had me
but no
you had one last thing to do
and i dont see her laughing
grab the elephant and well roll
elephant trumpeting
no no no
elephant stops trumpeting
okay i know this is impossible
but what if it wasnt
just think for a moment
think of all
of the impossible things youve done
and youve probably done plenty
have you ever gotten through
one of them alone
of course not that would be absurd
peter fought and flew and defied a king
and maybe he feels alone
purrs
but hes not
no one is remember that
elephant trumpeting
meows
guard lets go
elephant sniffles
grunts
crowd gasps
crowd gasps

crowd laughs
the magician
crowd gasps
snoring
lavaughn wake up now
this boy says the elephant must go home
you must make her disappear
coos

when i attempt that spell

to be with her family
yeah thats a lovely idea
but look around you
my magic is all failure
failure
i cant do it
nonsense
you brought an elephant through the roof
grunts
and dont you realize
it started something here
the very thing you wished for
elephant trumpets
hey magic man
lets send the big lady home
pigeon coos
i believe that you can perform
the necessary magic
i believe that only you
can set things right
dramatic music plays

dramatic music ends
hey its okay
elephant grunts

sighs
i heard it was different here before
there was light
there was life there was hope
the perfect kind of town
to make an elephant disappear
this is my home
but its not hers
elephant grunting
its hard to lose a friend
laughs
we have to say goodbye now
elephant trumpets softly
sniffles
the magician brought her here
and i believe that he can send her home

elephant trumpets
crowd gasps

heart beating
elephant groaning
heart continues beating
inhales deeply
speaking magical language
elephant groaning
fortune teller
belief is a great and invisible thing
it comes over us like sleep
we struggle along the edges
fighting it for reasons we cannot name
until as with sleep
we lose ourselves
we stop and we are restored
