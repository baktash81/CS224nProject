as you would to some minor nuisance 
what has happened here 
that night  i tried to cast a spell
on you and everyone else there 
a spell to make you believe again 
to care about magic 
because extraordinary things are possible 
if you believe 
but i had no business
attempting such a powerful spell 
because i m not a very good magician 
 cat meows 
i tried for mystery and wonderment 
 sighs  it brought disaster 
 insects chirping 
   elephant groans 
  i know

they look over towards the pond
and they see a hen 
the hen s got this piece of string 
and she s working the string
in and out of the mouth
of a frog by the pond 
up and down with the string
in the frog s mouth 
so  the fisherman says 
 why do you think the hen s doing that  
the farmer turns
to the fisherman and says
