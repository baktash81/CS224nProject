the orders   
are to attack the bridge 
we can expect heavy casualties 
no one will reach that bridge alive 
find your nerve  men 
we risk our lives
but we can take back our home 
for centuries 
poets have dreamt of dying for love 
i suppose we shall be the lucky ones 
the orders are to wait three hours
for the wind to turn east
then fire every gas canister we have 
there is an alternative  captain 
what is it  poirot 
we attack right now 
now 
yes 
within the next seven minutes 
perhaps eight 
every morning
the petrels take flight
just before the wind turns east 
you see 
this morning
they fly early 
the wind conditions are ideal now
to hide our advance 
hidden by the gas
we will cross 200 metres of no man s land
without being seen 
before the enemy even knows
that we attack 
if you re wrong  the wind will blow the
gas back on the rest of our army 
we gas ourselves as they kill us 
that s what you want 
i am not wrong 
it s an ambush 
i can t see them 
retreat 
you were right 
you are too sharp to be a farmer  poirot 
non  capitaine 
i asked you not to come 
i m a nurse  too 
i heard there was a wounded soldier
whose instincts on the battlefield
saved his entire company 
i did not save my captain 
and you agreed to marry me
before all of this 
katherine  you should go 
do you have any idea how love works 
when you love someone  you love them
through all their moods
and changes over time 
their worst qualities peak at nuisance 
their flaws become freckles 
and as it happens   
i love you 
what about this 
come here 
simple 
you ll grow a moustache 
poirot  where you been 
the arundell mystery 
are you  with case  
no  i am with hunger 
monsieur blondin 
monsieur poirot  you solved the case
in egypt 
it was a great success 
but i must return 
and tonight is gonna be   
merci  monsieur 
one of every dessert on the menu
is on its way 
anything else mr  poirot wants  just ask 
the whole house is wondering
why there s no music 
there s no music
because no money s been paid 
i pay everyone at the end of the night 
well  in my experience 
men who run such upright 
quality establishments like yours 
lose their wallets when the bill comes 
i m betting you already forgot my name 
rosalie otterbourne 
i m not just salome otterbourne s manager 
i m her niece 
she ll retire wealthy 
and i ll see to that 
and we get paid up front 
so if you want a little music 
first  i wanna see a stack of green
or whatever color money is
in your country 
you remember my name now 
ladies and gentlemen 
salome otterbourne 
i wanna tell you the natural facts
that a man don t understand
the good book right
and that s all
that s all
you know what 
we got to have more love
more understanding every day of our lives
and that s all
now when you see folks jump
from this or that
they don t know  they don t know
where in the devil they re at
and that s all
listen  people fighting one another
and think they re doing swell
and all they want is your money
and you can go to   
and that s all
that s all
y all got to have religion
i tell ya  that s all

monsieur 
monsieur  alors  monsieur 
you are defiling
one of the wonders of the world 
and also  by the way 
ruining a sublime jaffa cake 
monsieur 
you beautiful kite 
what  poirot 
bouc 
what are you doing here 
what do you think
about my kite 
i ll come down  stay there 
be careful 
of all the pyramids
in all the world 
you had to walk up to mine 
what a small world 
mon ami  bouc 
why would you fly a kite on the pyramids 
because no one ever has 
thousands of years 
right here  and i m the first 
you are the first 
poirot  it is good to see you 
are you on an exotic holiday
or an exotic case 
cases  i am in hiding from cases 
well  if you want to hide 
come and hide with us 
in assouan  we re on a whirlwind tour 
still the constant traveler 
mm  sadly  no 
uncle sacked me off the train
once he found out that i did nothing 
i tried jobs  an office 
i could manage the work 
i just couldn t fathom mornings 
but i ve made ends meet as a kept man 
come 
come  i shall introduce you to euphemia 
but who is euphemia 
well  you ll find out 
a new young lady
in the life of bouc 
a new name to me 
well  behind every kite flying man 
there is a woman 
here she is 
the only woman i have ever loved   
mother 
mother  you must meet hercule poirot 
  why 
  he s only the greatest detective alive 
oh  he exaggerates 
no  he is quite correct  actually 
you are quite the most ludicrous man
i have ever seen 
not the first time i ve heard this 
  and you re in my view 
  stepping aside 
be kind  mother 
poirot here is my friend  and he s famous 
and he s joining our dinner tonight 
  is he 
  i cannot intrude 
oh  no  not at all 
you bump my stock at the table 
it s not just mother and i on holiday 
we re celebrating with friends 
it s a wedding party 
ooh  is that me 
might be 
be nice 
excuse me 
 should have
entire situation managed 
 then back to business as usual  
do you have all of that 
good 
now  please see this telegram
sent off as soon as able 
and not another soul sees it 
no  i ll do it 
it s bad enough we have to stay
in this bourgeois nightmare of a hotel 
but i won t be party
to the oppression of the working class 
unless it s me  of course 
then she s perfectly fine with it 
i am calm  capable  and coping 
dignity 
marie van schuyler 
and i don t need a suite 
it s just me
and my nurse bowers 
i m mrs  doyle s godmother 
we do have reservations 
and will this area be cleared
for the party 
we don t want just anybody hanging around
and stealing the champagne 
is it very expensive 
merci 
ladies and gentlemen 
we are closing this reception
area for a wedding party 
everything fine  madame 
it s perfect 
the cost of this party
could feed a village for a year 
it s an obscene extravagance 
i know  wonderful  isn t it 
is it true you donated your entire fortune
to the socialist party  dear 
communist 
 money is the alienated essence
of man s labor and life  
money is the only friend
a woman can rely on 
look at this 
ladies and gentlemen  and mother 
it is my honor to introduce our hosts 
please welcome the newlyweds 
mr  and mrs  simon doyle 
there they are 
magnifique  madame 
  fantastic  linny 
  beautiful 
ah  love 
it is not safe 
i bore witness to a small drama
some weeks ago 
clearly  i caught only the first act 
like an angel  linny 
lucky devil 
fancy finding the one heiress
without adenoids and flat feet 
eloped as fast as they could 
convention be damned 
married for love
and got money by chance 
that s the lightning strike 
three cheers and a tiger from me 
how do i look 
like a million dollars 
mm  make that two million 
oh  my wedding gift from simon 
yes  paid for
with her account  so  hardly 
her gift to her via me 
i was sure bouc was fibbing
when he said he knew the hercule poirot 
enchant√©e  monsieur 
my congratulations
and my gratitude  madame 
merci  ladies  godmother 
cousin andrew 
simon 
cousin andrew  my trustee
for all ridge way affairs 
abroad and domestic 
he s practically family 
i made him come
so he d take a vacation for once 
i m only here for the champagne 
sacred honor 
and for this   
oh 
oh  that s so sweet 
isn t it adorable 
friends  i know you re all thinking
there is a mystery at play here 
the case of  why in the hell
would linnet ridge way marry him  
and i honestly can t say why 
i m not smart or romantic 
i don t have the words  or the money 
or the pedigree 
but i do love you 
and now   
well  i don t even want to say it 
lest the thieves come and steal you away 
to the bride and groom 
bride and groom 
  three cheers 
  three cheers 
salome otterbourne
sang the night we met 
so  i begged your old pal  rosalie 
to beg her to travel with us 
i wouldn t have missed it 
i haven t tasted caviar
in 10 years 
what a decadent display of wealth 
come on  linny  let s dance 
ah  the bereaved 
there s one at every wedding party 
the good doctor windlesham proposed
to miss ridge way
when she was still miss ridge way 
he and the papers
both had the deal as good as done 
then came the engorged stallion 
and now it s mrs  doyle 
if i were in his shoes  i d only come here
to put a bullet in the groom 
our other guests  linnet s godmother 
who despises linnet s wealth 
and the godmother s nursemaid 
bowers  who covets it 
as does linnet s own maid 
poor old louise 
oh  and there s cousin andrew 
he s a slippery fish 
no one except linnet trusts him 
we find mother and i
are the only sane people here 
the only one who seems
to like linnet at all
is her old schoolmate  rosalie 
and she s salome otterbourne s niece
and arranged for her
to come to play for them 
monsieur poirot 
come and dance 
oh  good luck 
rock me
in a cradle of thou love
  looking good  simon 
  come  everyone  let s go 
come on 
only feed me
till i want no more
then you take me
to your blessed home above
she s followed us again 
i m sorry 
alas  act three 
turns out there s two bereaved
at every party 
how s linnet 
no  no  thank you very much 
thank you  yeah  very nice 
try a piece 
oh  very nice 
oh  look at those boxes in there 
  he s here 
  who is 
poirot 
well  then let s speak to him 
excuse me  excuse me 
the snake is your friend  eh 
my best friend 
monsieur poirot 
sorry about the high drama last night 
do think about giving us
another go tonight 
you are much too kind to strangers 
careful  careful 
thank you 
  madame 
  so sorry 
i go  i go 
you all right 
mr  and mrs  doyle  i m so sorry 
actually  poirot 
we wanted to ask for your help 
it s  uh  jackie de bellefort 
she s followed us
every step of our honeymoon 
she and i   
we were engaged  you see 
has she made any specific threats 
no  she doesn t say a thing 
she only shows up  and sits  and stares 
pardonnez moi  non 
there is no case for me to accept 
she has committed no crime 
it s indecent  what she s doing 
and melodramatic 
and she s making an ass of herself
is what it is 
see  when i was with jackie 
i liked her  i did 
then i met linnet 
jackie just didn t exist for me anymore 
from  hello   i just couldn t imagine
any other path but by her side 
and lucky me  she felt the same 
i could ve punched the sun 
hmm  instead  you broke your engagement 
does he have to spend the rest of his life
with someone he doesn t love
to spare her feelings 
it s love 
it s not a game played fair 
there are no rules 
now  maybe she hasn t
committed a crime yet 
but i know jackie  she will 
she always settled her scores 
do think about it 
mademoiselle 
do i know you 
if you will permit me
a little moment to talk with you 
of course 
here it comes 
linnet paid a detective a bucket of money
to knock me off her tail 
she kindly offered  i politely declined 
boo hoo 
madame is used to getting what she wants 
her father was halfway to a gangster 
you have known madame doyle for some time 
we met doing the school play 
antony and cleopatra 
i was cleopatra 
until the teacher came
a week before opening
and decided to give my part to linnet 
i was stuck with charmian  the handmaid 
you have our newlyweds in the twist 
first  i did it just to be near him 
then i got bold  and let them see me 
i saw her smile fade
and lines crack across her forehead 
mademoiselle de bellefort 
you must give this up 
what is done is done 
bitterness will not undo it 
he is married 
he is in love with his wife 
simon loves me 
simon loves me 
i know it 
even if he s forgotten  dazzled by her 
love that fierce doesn t vanish 
i love him 
i love him madly 
badly  at every minute 
it s not something
i can switch off 
there s a reason the heart is the organ
given to love  you know 
if it stops to rest  we die 
and i won t die alone 
you can be sure of that 
it s a  22 caliber 
it s practically a toy 
maybe  to fix a broken heart 
all it takes is a single bullet 
damn her 
all right  what would you have us do 
try the police 
well  if i may humbly advise 
i am sure mrs  doyle has a fine home 
go to it now 
build your nest 
begin your lives together 
we could  simon 
we could go home and shut the gates 
we could be happy 
what  just pack it in 
but what about our honeymoon 
consider it the cost of love 
and a bargain at that  huh 
bonne nuit 
merci 
this way  don t dawdle 
  what s the scam here  simon 
  hurry on 
i thought we were sightseeing today 
yes  i know i invited you
for another 10 days
sightseeing in assouan to philae 
but circumstances invited inspiration 
so  like moses  not far from here 
we have made a surprise turn at the water 
  after all  i couldn t refuse   
  what 
   the queen of the nile 
 i have immortal longings in me  
bravo 
it is gorgeous 
mother  why don t
we have a boat like that 
you got too much money  linnet 
not enough sense 
but great taste in boats 
see 
i told you it d all be fine 
jackie won t be able to follow us anymore 
let s go 
all right  everybody aboard 
permission to come aboard 
oh  wow  it s beautiful 
you look so happy 
you deserve it 
we have the karnak all to ourselves
until abu simbel 
don t worry about your things 
darling louise will go back
and pack up all your rooms for you
and meet us at shellal 
happy to  miss 
thank you 
we have a piano tuned 
a chef stolen from shepheard s of cairo 
and enough champagne to fill the nile 
champagne 
it s not even half ten 
then we re behind 
so  there is one more above  yes 
hello  egypt 
all luggage from the hotel
is going to the karnak 
monsieur doyle 
i need monsieur doyle 
i need those three trunks there  oui 
i shall strike this like joe dimaggio 
  oh  completely useless 
  five  officer 
  make that a naught 
  five points 
bowers  my love 
i m winning by quite a margin 
well done 
well 
that s the borderline  surely 
  huh 
  what s that  there 
i d say that s a grebe  isn t it 
very beautiful 
  you just moved my puck 
  foul shot 
bouc  that was a foul shot
and you know it  take it again 
you re a cheat  a swindler 
linnet  you ve got cheats on board 
bowers and van schuyler are cheats 
just like these two 
katherine  mon amour 
monsieur poirot 
i hope you can forgive
my hijacking your holiday 
couldn t let you miss the fun 
it is an honor 
and it is convenient to my own plans 
although  travel by water
does not naturally agree with me 
oh  i could tell you   
well  i should not tell you  actually 
but i suspect you perhaps may have
included me for reasons
other than the fun 
i wish we d gone home like you said 
  ah 
  i don t feel safe here 
not me  not simon  even with jackie gone 
but you are among friends 
when you have money 
no one is ever really your friend 
now i m remembering
old jealousies and fights 
it takes a pill to get to sleep 
i don t feel safe with any of them 
i hoped you might watch for us 
hmm 
thank you 
mm    now 
and now 
see  completely normal 
i m so hot 
yes  you re in egypt 
it s malaria 
you don t have malaria 
you know i have a temperature 
that thermometer is broken 
it s perfectly normal 
  no  no  it s broken 
  no  it s not broken 
  oh  i m so hot 
  it s how it should be 
i know  i know 
tactless to talk business
to a bride on her honeymoon 
bad lawyer  you promised 
there s only a few quick signatures 
fair enough  my marriage has
made a difference  i m sure 
do give us more notice next time 
it    it s all quite straightforward 
the ceylon land concession
and the obvious changes to the new will 
the lease of the london property 
it s all quite straightforward 
i m sorry  cousin  you know me 
never met a contract
i couldn t find some corrections 
papa taught me too well 
not me  that s not my way 
i ve never read a contract in my life 
any deal that can t be made
with a handshake
just isn t for me 
go on  linny  sign it 
sooner you do 
the sooner we can get to bed 
you were the first girl who ever told me
that a woman can run her affairs
as well as a man or better 
don t tell me that score changed
with one little husband 
go get ready for the party  simon 
i promise i won t be too long 
i m being rude 
it s no rush 
just kick it to tomorrow 
up above my head
up above my head
  i hear music in the air
  i hear music in the air
  now up above my head
  up above my head
  you know i hear music in the air
  i hear music in the air
up above my head
up above my head
  i hear music in the air
  i hear music in the air
  and i really do believe
  yes  i really do believe
there s a heaven somewhere
heaven somewhere
up above my head
  up above my head
  come down  poirot 
i see trouble in the air
and i really do believe
that there s a heaven somewhere
heaven somewhere
bloody good fun 
bravissimo 
wonderful  as ever 
thank you 
madame  i am so moved 
your bluesy music
has joy on top for the dancing 
yet there is tragedy in there  too 
writing tragedy is easy 
i just imagine someone i wanna punish 
then i imagine them in love 
you ve  uh 
taken quite a keen interest
in salome otterbourne 
i thought poirot was impervious
to love s fever 
i was sick with it once 
it left me with enough regret
for a lifetime 
there are many fine detectives 
well  that is not true 
there are many average detectives 
but to be what i am 
it requires fixedness of mind 
the little grey cells pampered  indulged 
given all the oxygen in my blood 
and minutes on my clock 
no  i leave the tempest of love to you 
but what of the niece 
a beguiling lady  no 
is she 
a cool  methodical brain
of the highest order 
she sings well  too 
  hmm 
  i hadn t noticed 
she s  um  a schoolmate
of linnet s  i hear 
you are trying to keep secrets from me 
  from me  from me 
  what 
rosalie otterbourne
is an overtly beautiful woman 
and bouc has not spoken to her once 
it s nothing short of gobsmacked love 
look  i ve been bursting to tell you 
linnet introduced us months ago
and since then  there hasn t been
another woman i ve wanted to look at
except as a   
a nanny to our children 
she is the cleverest  most shocking 
most alive woman i ve ever met 
i m outclassed in a breath
and she loves me anyway 
i mean  it s the only
bad mark against her 
mon ami  bouc  amoureux 
shouting from the rooftops  huh 
well  no 
not where mother can hear 
madame bouc does not support
the match  huh 
she s never cared
for anyone i ve ever brought home 
unless it was clear
that they were only staying the night 
being american doesn t help either 
mother doesn t approve of people
being born outside mayfair 
she s furious at linnet
for making us a pair 
and her opinion  does it matter 
money matters 
and mine comes monthly from euphemia bouc 
i ve tried to earn enough
so that i don t need
her permission to marry 
only her blessing 
but i m just rotten at it 
all my life 
i never wanted to be anything to anyone
but an amusement 
but for rosalie  i   
i want to be good 
come along 
ship s crew ready for departure 
returning 5 00 a m 
and remember  we have new guests
arriving at abu simbel 
  good night 
  good night 
we are nearly there 
ladies and gentlemen 
we are approaching abu simbel 
we re all going 
no stragglers 
you  too  louise  you re with us 
i have the pressing to do 
we re in ancient egypt 
it was your idea for a honeymoon
when you were engaged 
  coffee  mrs  doyle 
  thank you  claire 
what s that 
the sandstorm is miles away  madame 
no need to worry 
i can t find my tube of carmine red 
i can t be expected to capture
these horizons without red 
brushes down  mother 
it s the temple of abu simbel 
ramesses the great awaits 
ramesses ii 
married to nefertari 
first and favorite of his eight wives 
on the walls
of the queen s burial mastaba 
he wrote a poem to her 
which is spectacular   
  oh  sir  may i see 
  oh  yes 
 my love is like no other 
 just by passing  she has stolen my heart 
 she is the one for whom the sun shines  
he is a man in love 
he murdered half of nubia 
great useless blocks of masonry
put up to minister to the egoism
of a despotic bloated king 
mm  i really like their hats 
fascinating story 
it s bad enough
to be married for one lifetime 
to be side by side for eternity
is inhumane 
why must you be
so cynical  mother 
people build towers
to love in song and stone
as if cooing over a pair of dark eyes
will save them from pain 
if anything  it will double it 
it s over there  thank you 
go on 
think you and that beautiful girl
will be the exception 
not every love turns to misery 
no  the lucky ones die in childbirth 
it s my job to protect you 
you think i don t know what you re after 
you    you want my blessing
to marry that girl 
well  you can t have it 
rosalie 
everything all right 
yes 
no more hiding 
  we ll make it on our own 
  yes 
whoo 
new passenger coming aboard 
i ve got too much
sand in my shoes 
here we are 
how s that 
you approve of them 
first man she ever brought home 
a wealthy lawyer 
straight  narrow 
on his way to being a missouri senator 
then  there was a baron
who owned islands 
manners of a king 
now  it s this penniless bouc
who drinks too much 
and laughs too loud
and always at the wrong thing 
i like him best 
do you have a husband  madame 
i ve had a handful of husbands 
each one  a handful 
mm 
are you married  mr  poirot 
i have not that felicity 
which felicity do you have 
i have my cases 
  i have my books 
  oh 
i  uh   
in fact  i have my eye
on a cottage where i hope  uh 
eventually to retire   
and garden 
i hope to perfect a new
strain of the vegetable marrows 
they are magnificent vegetables 
but they lack a little bit of flavor
which is   
i would prefer more flavorsome vegetables 
madame 
what are you really doing way out here 
mr  poirot 
madame 
you do realize
we ve barely held hands past cairo 
i haven t been myself 
well  who shall you be  then 
cleopatra  of course 
come with me 
come on 
the ruler of two kingdoms 
what would cleopatra say 
 oh  charmian 
 where think st thou he is now 
 stands he
 or sits he 
 or does he walk 
 or is he on his horse 
 oh  happy horse 
 to bear the weight of antony  
 he is speaking now 
 or murmuring    
oh  my god 
 where is my serpent of old nile  
look out  bouc

there was a balcony above the cliff 
a worker s platform 
but no sign of anyone 
do you think someone did that on purpose 
let s get you safe  dove 
small world 
the captain just swore
that jackie got here
when we left for the temple 
it couldn t have been her 
i know she tried to kill us 
i want her off the ship now 
she already had a ticket to board here 
bought ahead 
there s nothing we can do 
i don t care  she always does this 
just tell me what it costs
to get her away from me 
name a price 
i ll buy the whole damn boat if i have to 
i ll buy the whole damn country 
  madame 
  thank you 
thank you 
louise

i ll be sure to look 
okay  you   
you don t take your meals with us 
miss linnet prefers me not to 
oh 
ah  i love that girl linnet 
but when the revolution comes 
she ll be the first 
blindfold  last cigarette 
up against the wall 
bang 
some detective  my ledger 
you ve taken my book 
j ai fait une erreur b√™te  pardonnez moi 
i confuse you with  uh 
my edwin drood in the parlor 
  oh 
  i can see by your penmanship 
you are dickens  rival in precision 
mm hmm 
monsieur poirot 
i wanted you to know
you won t have to look out
for us any longer 
jackie might not be able
to see reason 
but we can 
we re going home 
we ll get a car to khartoum
first thing in the morning 
and then donkey to rail to ship
to wode hall 
and then familiar beds forever 
to hell with jackie de bellefort 
oh  dear 
one last cork  though  why not 
i do not normally take l alcool   
   but for this   
dove 
monsieur 
  yes 
  yes 
  to going home 
  to going home 
thank you 
you re not built for boats 
or champagne 
did you know that the wives
of dead pharaohs
were buried alive with them 
they must have been locked in screaming 
but i bet there was one who was willing
and couldn t bear to be parted 
you re sorry to see me 
like it or not  i m in his thoughts 
simon is afraid of me 
mademoiselle  you have a choice still 
you can ruin his life or begin a new one 
it may not be the life that you imagined 
but perhaps it will be the life
that god intended 
love is far too important to trust to god 
from the moment i met simon 
i knew one thing for absolute certain 
i will die if we are parted 
i once felt as you do 
i loved so much 
i thought that if i lost her 
i should die 
i lost her 
to another man 
a mortar shell 
visiting me in hospital 
i was to be discharged in a month 
but i begged for her to come at christmas 
to be together 
she came  but the train was   
after katherine 
i became
whatever it is i am now 
i was going to be a farmer 
forgive me  the champagne   
it loosens the  uh  memory
and the mouth 
ship s crew ready for departure 
it s after 12 00 
the crew s left the boat 
well  i want another cocktail 
  i m done with today 
  no  no 
time for bed  my love 
yes 
i ll take a pill 
so don t worry about waking me 
you re not joining her  simon 
oh  we ve already made love today 
  twice 
  three times 
sleep well  la reine linnet 
jackie  i wish you well 
i do 
i m not sorry for what we did 
but i m so sorry
for what it did to you 
i wish we could stay friends 
you were the only one
who never cared about the money 
good night  jacks 
this is the last time
that you ll see either of us 
you can t disappear 
  let s call it a night  jackie 
  yeah 
oh  no  stay for a bit 
she s working up for a scene 
god  i feel so free
and so fat headed
for not turning around sooner 
you can t get rid of me that easily 
simon 
we were bound 
heart and body  i gave you all of me 
a few months of good times  hmm 
were they even that good 
i swear  looking at you now
makes all the fond memories go sour 
it s like trying to remember a party
after you ve been sick 
simon  don t be cruel 
i ve run dry on sympathy 
did you really think this little stunt
of yours would bring me back to you 
you re a fool if you thought
i could ever love you again 
i don t think i ever did 
simon  that s enough 
you don t mean that 
you don t 
say you don t mean it 
simon 
simon 
  sorry 
  no  no  no 
rosalie  take her to bowers

to make it hurt more  doctor 
settle the score 
the bone s shattered 
we need a hospital 
that was so stupid of me
to rile up jacks like that 
you re a bright boy now 
you just might deserve that bullet 
don t leave her alone 
she didn t   
she didn t   
she could hurt herself 
she won t 
i ve given her something to calm her down 
i ll stay with her 
good  come on 
let s get him to bed 
careful 
all right  almost there 
here we go 
steady  steady  steady  steady 
  that s good 
  there we are 
this should help you sleep 
oh  god 
oh  god   
time of death 
six hours ago 
eight at most 
sometime between midnight and 2 00 a m 
no evidence of struggle 
she died in her sleep 
at least that 
gun held to the temple 
there s scorch marks there 
god   
one bullet 
small caliber 
probably a  22 
  practically a toy 
  practically a toy 
ah  good 
i was hoping you were the day shift 
is someone ill 
someone is dead 
  linnet doyle 
  linnet 
stop  what do you mean 
how 
i m afraid jacqueline de bellefort
has made good on her threat 
no  that s impossible 
i was with her all night 
she slept right here 
out cold 
could she have left
even for a moment 
did you leave her side or sleep at all 
no  not a minute  no  not a wink 
and even if i had 
i was scared she might hurt herself 
so i gave her enough morphia
to fell an elephant 
was there a single moment
when mademoiselle de bellefort
left your sight 
never  no 
so jackie couldn t
have murdered linnet 
just as she could not have
pushed a boulder onto simon doyle 
what did you do
after bringing her to miss bowers 
we came back here
to pick up the gun and lock it away 
i kicked it under the couch 
but when we came back 
we couldn t find it 
  i wanted to wake you 
  i said not to 
you did not want my assistance 
no  stop that 
she was linnet s friend 
it s all right 
he s a bloodhound  let him sniff 
simon was with the doctor
and jackie was with the nurse 
i just figured it was
an awful lovers  quarrel
and not a case for the detective 
ah  but the mysterious case
of the vanishing pistol 
someone locates it
in the moments between you bringing
mr  doyle to the doctor and your return 
and then presumably uses it
to commit the murder of linnet doyle
and part two lovers forever 
bouc  tell the captain
to dredge the river around the ship 
simon doyle must be told 
linnet 
no 
no 
oh  god 
it was jackie 
god damn her  i could kill her 
jacqueline de bellefort
was not the killer 
she shot me 
she has a concrete alibi
for the entire night
from the moment she fired her gun at you 
no 
oh  god 
linnet 
you have to help me 
please  you have to find out
who killed my wife 
did you suspect any of them 
everyone loved linnet 
yet  your wife confessed lately
that she did not feel safe with them 
there    there were petty things 
i  uh  wasn t crazy about her old beau
being on the ship 
mooning over her the entire time 
she mentioned something about salome 
some incident that had happened years ago 
she didn t say what exactly 
what of your maid  louise bourget 
there had been a disagreement  no 
it was just that louise had left
some things at the hotel 
silly things  nail varnish 
no  she had been with linnet for years 
she even had charge of linnet s necklace 
  check on the necklace 
  it s by the bed 
thank you  bouc 
it s not here 
so  did you see the necklace
when you came in this morning 
alors  i saw miss linnet there 
dead 
i dropped the tray and ran out 
what did she mean earlier
on the way to abu simbel
when she said the travel to egypt
was your idea 
for your own honeymoon 
um   
perhaps miss bourget would prefer privacy
for this intimate detail 
so  if you could please take mr  doyle   
but  no  if you please 
i prefer mr  doyle hear me 
so he does not accuse me of a secret 
  accuse you of a secret 
  oui 
she ended my engagement 
miss linnet gave a party last year 
a man spoke to me 
and found me after 
when he proposed  i gave notice 
miss linnet was suspect
of his intentions with me 
just a maid 
she had him investigated 
he had debits 
she offered to pay them all off
if he would drop me 
to make a test of his affection 
he dropped me 
for my benefit  she said 
that same money  handed to me as a dowry 
could have given me a life 
what did you do last night
after you left miss linnet 
i went to my cabin on the deck below 
did you go anywhere else 
see or hear anything else 
forgive me  sir 
if i had come outside my cabin to smoke 
i might have seen her killer
enter or leave her cabin 
but you did not or you did 
what is this 
uh  no  i    i did 
i did have a cigarette inside 
you all are staring at me 
it s making me   
please  you know we kept confidences 
i was childish at times  but that s all 
tell them  i would never hurt miss linnet 
yes  of course  easy  easy goes it 
uh  no one here
is accusing you of anything 
i know you ve always
taken good care of linnet 
and i will be certain to take care of you 
that can be enough  can t it 
surely  we can let the poor girl go 
you don t think someone would kill linnet
to steal her necklace 
i ve seen people poisoned for less 
dredge the river 
please be careful with those 
oh  come on 
these are what few
private possessions i have 
i trust you ll be sensitive 
all the money in the world
and she s in the freezer with the hams 
this is as much dignity
as we can afford the dead
in these circumstances 
uh  doctor  before you go 
you joined this wedding party
despite your obvious affection 
you had no reservation
to see her with another 
some people you can t say no to 
she asked 
if i may ask a question  please 
about your passport 
you go by dr  windlesham 
but this is not your natural title 
  no 
  lord windlesham 
born to  not earned 
what i do as lord windlesham
belongs to buck toothed tradition 
what i do as doctor is mine 
and dr  windlesham travels widely  hmm 
india  africa 
much of the world lacks access to modern
medicine we take for granted  poirot 
most nobility enjoy their nobility more 
linnet used to tease me for that 
said i shouldn t expect her to honeymoon
in a mud hut 
your thoughts to her were always tender 
what of the husband 
i don t know him well 
what i do know  i can t recommend 
this is appropriate 
mr  doyle would have us
focus our suspicions on you 
me 
i was with him all last night 
indeed  you gave him
a strong opiate injection 
he was asleep 
you could have left him at any time
and not been observed 
  did he ask for the drug 
  he was in pain 
there are less powerful pain medications
in your bag which would suffice 
you created for yourself an opportunity 
  i didn t create an opportunity 
  she was unkind  no 
she flaunted her new love 
yet still called you like the puppy dog 
seeing them pained you 
and like the strong opiate injection 
you could end your pain with a bullet 
lords demand to get what they want 
and you are still a lord 
what do you want me to say 
what do you want me to say 
that i know i m ridiculous 
i m not a fool 
i knew she was settling for me 
i didn t mind 
when she married simon 
i actually thought
about ending my own life 
they all thought our engagement
was for the families 
the papers  for the damn aristocratic
theatrics of it all 
the shame of it is   
i loved her 
little linny and cousin andrew 
i knew her
since we were children 
were you aware of any grudges
against the family 
more than many 
her father got rich
making rich people poor 
linny continued the practice 
did you hear anything
of the commotion last night 
i was all snores by 11 00 
and the contracts you wished her to sign 
they are very important 
yes  they are  were 
with linny gone  the  uh 
estate will have to be redrawn 
may i see them 
forgive me  these are confidential 
i must insist 
  respect for the deceased 
  no matter  i know what they contain 
i doubt that very much 
i believe they extend your stewardship
of madam doyle s estate 
despite her marriage  no 
who told you 
i am hercule poirot 
i do not need to be told 
i have eyes and they see 
a brain and it thinks 
it now thinks somewhat poorly of you 
  you think i killed her 
  did you kill her 
i don t benefit a dime
from her death  mr  poirot 
you can look at the will i revised 
a godmother stands to inherit 
her husband legally gets the rest 
you won t see my name anywhere 
perhaps the intention was not to inherit 
but to conceal 
you executed control
over her vast fortune 
not a concern  so long as
there is no impropriety 
no speculation by loyal cousin andrew 
in a time of market decline 
this is not a kind of thing
you can prove on a boat 
you endeavored to obtain a signature
by trickery  from little linny 
and you failed 
you knew it was only a matter of time
before her keen eyes
uncovered your thievery 
unless her eyes were closed forever 
you see  in my position  mr  poirot 
i often have to transport items
such as canvases worth millions 
and they need security 
so  if i wanted to kill her 
i would have used this 
a  45 
yes 
you may go 
a  45 
why would he risk going back
for jackie s gun if he had that 
he would not 
miss bowers  if i might trouble you 
he wants to speak with me 
i m laying down a corner 
there s nothing to fear 
only you might know something of value 
that would be the shocking twist 
if you wouldn t mind her coming alone 
i damn well would 
i want these
served at my funeral 
mm hmm 
when you kept vigil with
mademoiselle de bellefort 
did she make threats against linnet doyle 
no  her threats were against herself 
she wanted to pitch herself
into the drink and not come up 
that s why i gave her all the morphia 
how fortunate that we had you with us 
you have been a nurse companion
for how long 
um    well  coming on 10 years 
all with mrs  van schuyler 
so it feels like 20 
the job came to me late in life 
ah  after you lost your great wealth 
wealth 
acquired tastes require acquisition 
and here  you moon over truffle
and king crabs 
so  too  your gown  chanel 
your luggage  vuitton 
your shoes  perugia 
all the peak of chic 10 years past 
worn and patched over 
how many years since
you had caviar  did you say 
many lost fortunes in the crash 
many of them due to papa ridge way
and his unscrupulous business practices 
perhaps that explains your reaction
to the lease of linnet s
london property  hmm 
it was once called the bowers building 
ah   
we employed over a thousand people 
good wages 
we spread our wealth  when we had it 
so many like family 
some never found work again 
so  yes  i miss caviar 
but i miss them more 
and you  feeling as you do 
with your charge
mademoiselle de bellefort
drugged into slumber 
you are free to move about the ship 
to find the gun 
  to shoot linnet doyle   
  no 
he specifically asked
to see you separately 
     while she sleeps 
  mrs  van schuyler 
  stop interfering 
  ah  a visitor 
she cannot be without her miss bowers
for even a moment 
please  please  join us to tea  huh 
he s just accused me of shooting linnet 
no  no  no 
i merely  uh  suggest a possibility 
i don t approve
of this interrogation 
i mean  who are you to question us 
i am the working man 
the skilled laborer 
the hero of your own economic fairy tales 
well  i don t care for it  or for you 
you are meant to be finding the killer
of my goddaughter 
i never had children of my own 
i had linnet 
you are aware  of course 
that you are a key beneficiary
in linnet doyle s will 
you accuse me now of murder 
oh  no  he accuses everyone of murder 
it is a problem  i admit 
that i would kill
my own goddaughter for money 
i already gave away a fortune 
i don t give a fig for money 
i see no reason to continue
this conversation  come on  bowers 
the stewards on this ship keep
an excellent room  have you noticed 
a truly first rate housekeeping staff 
he s off his rails 
beds made every day 
sheets folded in marvelously precise
45 degree hospital corners  i must say 
unlike  for example  the day we departed 
when the beds were made
in the flowing edged bedspread style 
but  you know  when i saw
mademoiselle de bellefort
asleep in miss bowers  room
on our third day aboard 
the bed was as it had been on our first 
as yet unslept in 
bouc 
where did you find miss bowers
when you sought her aid 
in mrs  van schuyler s room 
my mind asks   
here is a woman for whom the fire against
class and materialism burns so hot
and yet she keeps a servant 
no 
her servant is no servant   
nor nurse  only companion 
let us name the reason 
love 
don t worry 
and i know this 
it s all right 
people kill for love 
they found something 
what 
they found something 
monsieur poirot 
well done  young man 
go and get yourself cleaned up 
yes  sir 
it s your scarf 
but it went missing 
i ve been looking for it since the temple 
it s true 
we couldn t find it anywhere 
it has had
an adventure in your absence 
your scarf  complete with bullet holes   
used to dampen the noise of a shot 
also a bloodied handkerchief
and the  22 derringer
belonging to jacqueline de bellefort 
two bullets fired 
we return immediately to assouan 
ooh  i like this 
the full force of his forceful attention 
the great mind  all mine 
flirtation  however delightful 
will have no effect 
a woman shows you a direct bit of interest
and you assume
it can only be to hide guilt 
whoever she was
must ve done a number on you 
that mask covers your whole face 
doesn t it 
you knew linnet doyle before you came
to entertain us  yes 
  paths crossed 
  you did not like her 
i stay polite 
monsieur doyle mentioned an incident
with the victim long ago 
a reason for possible animosity 
poolside  kennebunkport 
summer of  24  before i was someone 
i played a show at the hotel
and thought to take rosie
for a swim before packing 
a young girl complained to her papa
about having to share the pool
with a colored 
we were told to leave 
and when i did not abide 
i was made to 
i wasn t sure she d even remember it 
i do 
it was  25 
so does she 
mademoiselle 
she shamed you in front of your ward 
monsieur poirot 
if i put a bullet in everyone
who took a potshot at me
for not keeping to my place 
the world would be littered
with dead white ladies 
linnet was just a kid back then 
taught by a bad daddy 
but she became my friend
in boarding school 
gave the other girls license
to do the same 
truth to tell   
linnet was as easy to hate as love 
i might have done both 
that is a very honest reply 
i thank you both for your time  mesdames 
there was one final question 
it is a curiosity of mine 
your hat 
in the turban style 
as many times as i have seen you 
you have always worn one like i 
but it is out of the fashion  no 
not when i wear it 
if you would indulge me 
please  to remove it 
  mm mm 
  oh  it s all right  rosie 
he s driving at an answer
he already knows 
 22 caliber  like the one
that killed linnet doyle 
i ve used it  if you wanna ask 
twice in defense  once in anger 
last night was not that once 
you tell me if i m lying 
mr  poirot 
monsieur 
you interrupt at a poor time  madame 
you re meant to be the detective 
yet i found this 
it was there 
right in my vanity drawer 
face up like a yolk 
you know i didn t take it 
no  which is why
our killer has remanded it
to your custody to return 
  thank you 
  unless   
  poirot 
  unless what 
unless you took the necklace
to steer suspicion away from you 
evidence is easily disposed of
over the ship s railing 
whoever did this made a show of discovery 
why would my mother murder linnet 
bouc  you said your mother was
furious with linnet for making you a pair 
madame  it was linnet doyle
who introduced your son
  to a woman you distrust  no 
  rest assured 
if i had a bullet in my pocket
to correct my son s poor taste 
i would not spend it on mrs  doyle 
mother  please  that is not helping 
perhaps  but i have seen
your excellent landscapes 
you are a patient woman who achieves
every effect she intends in time 
who so diligently planned
to have me aboard this ship 
yet with my suspicions
diverted in another direction 
that is a private affair 
that is a concluded affair  madame 
  enough 
  enough indeed 
i am now prepared
to present the conclusions
of my other  more secret case
and put it to rest 
secret case 
what 
what does he mean 
mother 
  monsieur 
  mademoiselle 
mesdames  thank you for joining us 
bouc 
i will make my own confession 
when we met in giza  i told you
i was on vacation from my detective work
when in fact 
i was and have been on a case 
what case 
you 
at the request of your mother 
madame bouc 
who cabled me in distress
some weeks ago 
my mother  in distress 
i was bidden to follow the otterbournes
to determine the character and fitness
of the show business woman
who had stolen your heart 
you did this to me 
i m your mother  i ve done far worse 
to observe them 
i had to consume many doses
of the bluesy music 
which  i confess 
i did not expect to enjoy 
but  in fact  i did very much
as performed by madame otterbourne 
it was unusual for me 
but it was very nice 
that s why you were in giza 
how we met  accidentally  
i am sorry 
i had to make you see what she is 
tell him  detective 
i will tell you  bouc 
having observed rosalie otterbourne 
having inspected
her books of accounting   
yes  i know  please forgive me  madame 
what 
   i can tell you 
she gambles frequently 
though frequently wins 
she drinks little  she tips well 
she pays her employees 
and her taxes on time to the dime 
she is diligent  she is forthright 
in business  perhaps even virtuosic 
though at piano  sadly  amateur 
as for her adopted mother 
she drinks to excess twice a week or more 
she smokes cigarettes
of various compositions 
and i believe that at least two
of her marriages were not   
i think  strictly legally ended 
but she is a magnificent personality 
mm 
i do not yet know
who murdered linnet doyle 
but i do know this   
rosalie otterbourne is irrevocably in love
with your son and is his better in virtue 
she is more than fit 
she is a find 
it wasn t enough that we re happy 
i did not trust her 
despite the detective  i still don t 
i love her 
that has to count for something 
why should it 
corinthians had it wrong on every point 
love isn t patient or kind 
it envies and boasts and doesn t care
who gets mowed down 
it angers  it is irritable 
it keeps record
of every transgression against it 
and good god  it fails 
sure as a face ages  love fails 
he really wants your permission 
but he doesn t need it 
any more than i need
to meet your standard 
or yours 
i ve had a chance to observe you 
wanna know what i make of your character 
he is obsessive 
is vain  is smug 
is lonely for a reason 
a detestable  tiresome  bombastic 
egocentric little freak 
how dare you 
get out of my way 
  mademoiselle  if i may 
  ooh 
miss otterbourne 
i owe you an explanation 
please  allow me to apologize 
have you ever met a man
who says his own name
as many times
as hercule poirot   
confirmed 
it is louise bourget 
there s no sign of drowning 
they threw the body in after 
she must have got caught up in the paddle 
she was murdered on board 
within the last hour 
money 
covered in blood 
louise bourget hinted that
she might have seen
the killer make an escape 
if indeed she had  she might have
offered her silence for a sum of money 
a blackmail 
only the killer preferred
her silence absolute 
her throat  cut clean  the blade   
short 
very sharp  like a   
like a scalpel 
you 
you killed them 
it was    it was his scalpel 
he killed louise 
and she saw him leaving linny s cabin 
you ve been lying ever since 
you re the one
linnet should never have trusted 
i always told her your firm
was bilking her for millions 
you murderer 
i will kill you 
hey  stop it 
get off of me 
hey  hey  hey 
have some respect 
how many have to die
before you do something 
a throat cut while
you run me over the coals 
he s trying 
well  he d better try harder 
or we ll all wind up
in an egyptian jail cell 
if you won t name the killer  i will 
no 
he loved linnet too much 
there s your motive right there 
look  all of you just keep quiet
and let poirot work 
in any case 
we ll reach the port by morning 
for now  it s safest if we
just keep to our own cabins
with the doors locked 
she was engaged for a time 
i ll have to write
and let him know that she s   
gone 
they broke it off  but he d want to know 
that s good of you 
it s horrible 
all of it  horrible 
who could do such a thing 
you must have some theory 
monsieur poirot 
don t you 
i have one final interview to conduct 
full speed 
as i have allowed affection
to color the clarity of my thoughts
in your investigation 
i must ask you to remain
as witness to this interview 
how long did you know linnet doyle 
i m a suspect now 
how long did you know linnet doyle 
i know your tricks 
i ve seen this play before
from that side of the table 
a long time 
we weren t close  just familiar 
my parents considered her parents
their equals 
so we grew up at the same parties
and wound up kissing each other s friends 
you can t catch me at anything
because i haven t done anything 
so  ask whatever you like 
where is your coat 
why did you not wake linnet
when simon was shot 
poirot 
don t 
her husband was shot 
you have such sympathy
for the former fianc√©
of louise bourget 
you wish to inform him of her fate 
yet  you do not spare
the same sympathy for linnet 
i thought she would be asleep 
she said that she had taken
a sleeping pill 
rubbish 
god  i was so happy to see you  bouc 
but you lie to me 
you lie in my face 
and now  you make yourself my prey 
what happened 
did he kill linnet 
was it you
and rosalie together 
no  she is honest 
too proud to live well from theft 
  you alone did this 
  no  i didn t 
you returned to the parlor alone 
to find the gun and you did 
you then went to the doyles  cabin
to inform linnet about simon 
she was sleeping  you saw the necklace 
you were assaulted by temptation 
but she woke  catching you 
so you shot her 
no  i didn t  that s not   
only louise bourget saw you leaving
and demanded money 
instead  you brought her a blade 
  no  i didn t kill   
  two murders 
all to secure a stolen fortune
so you would not need permission to marry 
only her blessing 
i didn t kill anyone 
i never found a gun 
that s not what happened 
no  you did not kill anyone 
linnet doyle s murder was premeditated 
it required exact timing  a stolen scarf 
you did not kill her  but
you did go to the doyles  cabin
and found linnet already dead 
you knew she had been killed
before all of us 
but instead of calling for help   
you took the necklace 
after i told you of the cabin search 
you attempted to return it 
but you came upon louise bourget
arguing with someone  demanding money 
you saw her throat cut 
you saw her murdered 
you know who killed louise 
but you could not say 
not without admitting you stole 
so you hid it in your mother s room 
believing that she would catch no blame 
while you remained silent 
only you had louise bourget s blood
on your coat 
if   
if 1 admit this  if i say it   
you will face punishment
for theft 
you will face prison 
i ll    i ll lose rosalie 
she loves you 
i can t   
you cannot let a killer go free
to protect yourself 
i wanted to tell you 
all i thought was how   
all i thought was how happy we d be 
we could run off and get married 
no obligations  we d be free 
stupid 
it was so stupid  i know 
who did you see her with 
you were a terrible friend  poirot 
why did you have to teach me to be good 
who 
you could never understand   
what people will do for love 
come on 
no 
mon ami  bouc  huh 
bouc 
i heard gunshots 
  i heard a shot 
  what s going on 
did you catch him 
poirot  did you catch whoever it was 
what is it 
was someone hurt 
i have never seen anyone so happy as he   
when he was with you 
he told me how much he hoped
you d be happy one day  too 
that you d get tired of being
just a pure cold detective 
be human instead 
i don t want you happy 
i want you to find who did this 
it was your gun that shot him 
it was his gun 
  i was in here 
  his gun 
i was here 
well  you were there 
you saw me  tell her 
it s true  he was in here 
no 
my pistol was in my suitcase
in my cabin and   
why would you leave your gun
with a killer on board 
because   
we d be at port by sunrise 
if the local police saw a dark man
holding a gun 
they d shoot me before i ever saw a noose 
you have failed   
your every duty 
his friend 
i did fail 
linnet doyle 
louise bourget 
bouc 
i will not fail him now 
the murderer is here 
and will stay here 
miss otterbourne is right  i love to talk 
an audience 
i am vain  you see 
i love people to hear me
bring the solution to a crime and say 
 see  how clever is hercule poirot  
when all i want now 
would give anything for   
is one conversation   
with bouc 
i would stomp about and say 
 around a person like linnet doyle
 there are so many conflicting hates
and jealousies 
 it is like the cloud of flies 
buzzing  buzzing  
and he would laugh at me 
 then play your clever games  
he would say 
 ask your questions
till the right one comes  
 who would want to kill her 
 who could have  
and then  i would ask and i would see 
yes  bouc showed me too late 
a person in love will do anything 
love makes us do reckless things 
rash things 
a boulder falls  rash 
louise murdered  wild 
bouc  shot 
i had believed the identity
of madame doyle s killer was obvious 
cousin andrew katchadourian 
doing as he did
at the temple of abu simbel 
where he wandered off alone  desperate 
where he saw an opportunity 
hoping to hide his sins under a rock   
   he pushes one 
i   
i don t know what i was thinking 
i   
i wasn t    i wasn t thinking 
i saw them below 
and    and thank god i missed 
and you must all know   
i didn t kill her 
i would never do that 
i    i loved her 
i didn t kill her 
no  he did not 
linnet doyle s murder was not a wild act 
it was methodically planned 
the details  the times 
the bullets  the alibis 
but planned by who 
i turn to bouc once more 
why did you paint him in a green jacket 
he wore red on the pyramid 
my red paint went missing 
it was stolen
by linnet doyle s murderer 
by her husband  simon doyle 
me 
that s ridiculous 
how could he  he was shot 
yes  he was shot 
we know this for certain 
what we do not know for certain
is when he was shot 
or what he did in the moments
after we believed that he was 
consider   
madame doyle reported her husband was
cross with louise over some nail polish
left at the hotel 
why should he care 
because madame doyle wore
blood red nail polish 
which had  for him  an intended use 
this gone 
madame bouc s paint would have to do 
he also did not expect his wife
to invite a detective to the party 
so  to be safe  he puts me to sleep 
a single glass of champagne
at his insistence sends me to my bed
with my head spinning 
drugged for his performance 
miss otterbourne  you saw a gun fired 
you saw simon collapse 
a blood soaked handkerchief to his leg 
at which point you left him 
busy with jackie and finding the doctor 
this gives the murderer but moments alone 
moments are all he needs 
he picks up the pistol 
he runs to his wife s cabin 
simon   
and he shoots her 
through the temple 
there were scorch marks
on linnet doyle s wounds 
the missing scarf
would have eliminated them 
but it was not used on her 
it was instead used here
to muffle the sound of another shot 
  what s the matter  bouc 
  there s been an accident 
he returns here
to retrieve the scarf
which he had previously hidden 
where he took the gun one more time
and fired it into his own leg 
after which 
he replaced one bullet
into the gun so if it was found 
we could count not three 
but the two shots
that we believed had been fired 
he then wraps the handkerchief 
the scarf  and the gun
and throws them
into the waters of the nile 
then makes himself ready
for the arrival of dr  windlesham 
she shot me 
i can t move my leg 
your alibi secured  you avoid suspicion 
indeed  you ensured
a multitude of suspects 
encouraging a guest list
not merely of friends and family 
but exclusively those carrying grudge
or grievance against your wife 
even our entertainment 
all passing
as a new husband s thoughtfulness 
blame deflected in every direction
except at you 
you are mad 
that i would shoot myself 
and then somehow kill louise and bouc 
he s right  he couldn t have killed them 
he did not kill them 
the second and third murders
were committed
by his accomplice in the first 
and  i believe  by the mastermind
behind this entire ingenious plot 
jacqueline de bellefort 
his lover once  his lover still 
introducing the couple  stalking them 
finding them aboard this ship 
shooting simon with a blank 
all to create two unassailable alibis 
the grieving husband
left to inherit his wife s fortune
and then  in time 
to marry the woman he loves 
has always loved 
when i asked louise bourget if she had
seen anything  she gave a curious answer 
 if i had come outside my cabin 
i might have seen the killer  
not yes  not no 
but a veiled threat to linnet s killer 
who was present in the room 
simon doyle 
who then assured her that louise
would be taken care of 
indeed  she was 
as soon as he was able  simon 
no doubt  sent a message to jacqueline 
warning her of the new danger 
telling her where to find a weapon 
and then  when bouc   
when bouc detected who had killed louise 
simon shouted   
come on 
   a warning to his accessory   
who shot bouc through the throat 
before he could reveal
jacqueline de bellefort 
you killed my son 
i ll see you die for this 
rosie  please 
i swear it 
i swear it 
you can t all believe him 
he has no proof 
true  i have only a sunken gun
wiped of fingerprints  yes 
but it came with a gift 
the handkerchief 
the warm waters of the nile in springtime
would set the color of blood
to a dull brown 
in those same mysterious waters 
carmine red paint will fade   
to pink 
oh  how clever is hercule poirot 
was the ambition his or yours 
he needed things 
i needed him 
you never cared for money 
but you could deny him nothing 
not even a plan
when he could not devise his own 
simon  what do we do 
let s go 
they ll take us in 
we ll be separated 
we get off the boat now and we run 
come on 
it s all right  simon 
give it to me 
uh uh 
listen to me 
we can make it 
we ve got to go now 
and we ve got to be strong 
we can be strong 
we can be strong 
i love you 
i am sorry you have become so wealthy 
ah  nothing i can t fix 
we might just keep some 
come on 
they will arrest me now 
no 
so long as you settle her affairs honestly
and pay back what you owe 
you return to london  doctor 
there s nothing for me in london anymore 
west africa 
perhaps i can do some good there 
i wish i d never got to see you work 
um   
perhaps   
  see you soon  syd 
  thanks a lot for tonight 
see you in a couple days 
tell the band one more song 
then they have to finish their rehearsal 
watch it  mister 
when the storm
of life is raging
stand by me
when the storm
we re closed  mate 
of life is raging
stand by me
when this world
is tossing me
whoa
  hey  hey  hey  hey
