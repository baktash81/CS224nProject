that supplies combat units
the last few years have brought
real progress
in the interests of women in
all aspects of naval service
whats more the navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses
for all its male recruits
demonstrating even more progress
whoa whoa whoa
mr hayes
if a cannibal used a knife and fork
would you call that progress too
well perhaps if i could just finish
madame chairman your questions
oh im just an old dame
without much time left
so youll pardon me
if i jump right in here
im deeply concerned over the navys
seemingly incontrovertible attitude
toward women in the military
case in point the lark report
uh madame chairman this is
an internal document of the us navy
the navys analysis of that f14 crash
at coronado last year
female aviator
it just so happens
you were party to this report
am i right
i am really not prepared
to go into an indepth
if you are vying for the office
of the secretary of the navy mr hayes
id like to think
you were prepared for anything
especially if youre lookin
for my confirmation
im struck by the illspirited
tenor of your report
degrading remarks
by other aviators
innuendo about her performance
in unrelated situations
theres even a reference here to
her sexual activity the weekend prior
these are not
unrelated circumstances
in my seven years
on this committee
i have never seen a downed aviator
treated like this never
im deeply disturbed
by this report mr hayes
not just what it bodes
for the future of women in the navy
but your future as well
do you expect to take criticism
for using this confirmation hearing
as a pulpit
for womens rights
look nearly onequarter of
all jobs in the us military
are still to this day offlimits
to women and that has gotta change
what about those that say women arent
suited for all jobs theyre physically weaker
how strong do you have to be
to pull a trigger
that was quick
yeah she did great
are you kidding
shes always great
private meeting
thats what we want
are you worried about the next round
of base closures senator
as long as it doesnt affect me
defense boys already called
they want
a private meeting with you
ill act surprised
senator this is a contingency program
for 100 per cent integration
if female candidates measure e up
in a series of test cases
the dod will support full
integration within three years time
we get our man you get
your gender blind navy senator
surely youre e not gonna
balk at that
i have to pick
the test cases
the navyll want approval
over the women
so ill approve their approval
come on senator
lets concentrate on the steak
and not the peas
if women measure e up to the men theyve
got the job thats whats on the table
youre not having
second thoughts are you
well doug
congratulations mr secretary
so what program
id go crt
combined reconnaissance team
seals
sixty per cent dropout r ate
no womans gonna last a week
i dont care who she is
then i suggest
we start there
good work
hostile activity
mined area
i say again
hostile activity mined area
maintaining holding action
carrying one wounded
extracting to new location
secondary pz over
bravo six this is avalanche
negative
on secondary rendezvous
strongly suggest new location
over
stand by avalanche
will consult team leader
bravo six
go to sea level
say again your last
over
bravo six this is avalanche
bravo six
weve lost the horizon
bravo six
you didnt account for that
yes sir we did
but we didnt count on the seal unit
being delayed for five hours
and then exfiltrating
this close to this high terrain
but keyhole5 will be los
in 18 minutes sir
launch base will need
that much time to key their gear
advise launch base
accordingly goldstein now
sir id recommend against it
these are skilled operators
theyve grasped their problem by now and
will take action to get back online
its just a glitch
in the net changeover sir
ill have it ironed out
momentarily
advise launch base
goldstein
something to add
lieutenant
if we keep the primary satellite the unit can
negotiate its way down to this plateau here
reestablish comms
its a clear shot
what about those two areas inland
thats closer to their position
but thats behind them
theyll wanna keep moving
seaward sir yet find a spot
that gives em the line of sight
on the satellite
this plateau here
thats where id head sir
last i checked you were a topographic
analyst not an operations specialist
why dont you just let it
if they have wounded
they might be inclined
to stay put
wait till the new bird
comes into los
but they also know the tides are
slipping out under their recovery sub
theyll hump their wounded out theyll
reach this plateau in ten minutes
make that nine now
we cant switch the net sir
well be listening for them
on the wrong channel
with the wrong crypto
give it exactly nine minutes
okay lets see
what the cat dragged in
theyve preapproved
all these candidates
top scores marksmanship
distance runner took fifth place
in some intraservice marathon age 27
perfect till they do
a chromosome check
some impressive
fitness reps here
holder of several records
for female powerlifting
is this the face you want to see
on the cover of newsweek
she looks like the wife
of a russian beet farmer
i like this one
triathlon winter sports
olympic contender
winner of the arlie burke
essay contest works intel
too much of a thinktank soldier
no no show me show me
well this really is
top drawer
with silk stockings inside
weve waited about as long as we dare
do it
change the net
launch base
this is nic control
were going to conduct
a net changeover
to keyhole5 at
the following coordinates
this is bravo six
still got six heartbeats here
holding on some kind of plateau
i say again six passengers
looking for a ride home
were good to go
belay my last
copy that maintain perimeter
advise further hostile status
that was good headwork lieutenant
well thank you sir
im glad we could get
involved and do some good
now the problem is
intel officers dont get involved
we monitor analyze
you need to learn
the fine art of detachment lieutenant
excuse me theres a call
from the sec navs office
ill take it inside
no sir excuse me
lieutenant oneil
the calls for you
ill take it inside
thanks for holding
ill put you through
im thinking about redoing
the place
its beginning to remind me
of an old whorehouse over the years
good evening maam
good evening lieutenant
maam may i ask
what this is regarding
didnt they tell you
no maam
well thisll be a toot
you read ill pour
its jus t a test case jordan
but if things work out
if you can go the distance
it could well change the militarys
official policy on women in combat
or actually
its official nonpolicy
begging your pardon
senator
but you do understand this
involves seal training
i do
i also understand
that you applied for active duty
during the gulf war and got turned down
yes maam there was an intel slot
available aboard the uss polk
but they told me that submarines
had no bathroom facilities for women
did that piss you off
yes maam it did
good i like pissed off
sit down lieutenant
yes maam
have you got a man
maam
at home
fianc√© steady beau you know
some kind of solid heterosexual
i hate askin but i dont want
this thing blowin up in our faces
if you happen to be battin
for the other side
yes maam theres someone
well wonderful
honey come on i survived jump school
dive school and three brothers
i think i can take care
of myself
the only thing that scares me
are the sexual politics
im just not interested in being
some poster girl for womens rights
what
hmm

you dont have anything
to say about this
i guess i dont
honey this is just
a career opportunity
you dont want me sleeping my way
to the top do you
but the seals babe
these guys are worldclass warriors
they see you coming
i mean
im aware they may not want me there
may not
yes
they will eat corn flakes
out of your skull okay
to tell you the truth
i dont get it
i mean youre doing
shithot at intel
why do you wanna go off
and play soldier girl for
royce were the same age
we entered the navy the same month
which one of us
is wearing more ribbons
oh come on this is just cause
i got lucky during the gulf war
yes thank you operational experience
is a key to advancement
yet anyone with tits cant be on a sub
cant be a seal and dont even think
hey whoa
if you made up your mind to do it go
you always do what you wanna do anyway
dont ask my permission
you wanna go off and live with a bunch of
cockswinging commandos for three months
three months
what if i make this and go operational
for three years what then
oh man did i just miss
a decade or something
will i wait if you go off to war
is that what youre asking me
yeah something like that
exactly like that
i didnt know i was gonna have to decide
the rest of my life tonight jordan
maybe we should just
let this happen
get your dick back in here
dont ask me to tell you how im gonna
feel in three years i dont know
i mean neither do you
right up until you said that
i thought i did
carry on
put it down here we go

your sex lieutenant
youll have a separate bed
a separate head
if you have any special medical needs
inform the infirmary
if your classmates or a superior
acts in a harassing
or otherwise unbecoming manner
you are to inform me
immediately
so that i can deal with it
immediately
it may not always run smooth
but were trying to make it
as painless as possible
thank you sir but i expect
a certain amount of pain
any questions
none at this time sir
then were done lieutenant
yes sir
permission to speak sir
im not here to make
some kind of statement
i care about completing the training
and getting operational experience
just like everyone else

instructor pyro
educate the lieutenant
you received an automatic
30second deduction
which put you
under the wire
its called gendernorming
oneil
its standard procedure
for all females in physical training
what all females
if im the only one
i think i should have
the choice
stand at attention
lieutenant oneil when i want
your opinion ill give it to ya
did you take this matter up
with my command master chief
i believe you instructed me to come
directly to you sir
if i felt i was being
mistreated in any way
oh
all right lieutenant
i want names
i want specific grievances
permission
to speak frankly sir
its you sir
it started the moment i came here
oh really
its the double standard
the separate quarters
the deferential treatment
its the way you practically pulled
my chair out for me when we first met
because i was civil
now youre complainin
i cant afford civility sir
how am i supposed to fit in when
youve got me set up as an outsider
youve given me
a different set of rules
the answer is i cant
why dont you just issue me a
pink petticoat to wear around the base
did you just have
a brain fart
begging your pardon
sir
did you
just waltz in here
and bark at your
commanding officer
if so i regard that
as a bona fide brain fart
and i resent it
when people fart inside my office
i think youve resented me
from the start sir
what i resent
lieutenant
is some politician
using my base
as a test tube
for her grand
social experiment
what i resent
is the sensitivity
training
that is now mandatory
for my men
the obgyn
i have to keep on staff
just so someone can keep track
of your personal pap smears
but most of all
what i resent
is your perfume
however subtle it may be
competin with the aroma
of my fine 359 cigar
which i will put out
this instant
if the phallic nature of it
happens to offend
your goddamned
fragile sensibilities
does it
no sir
no sir what
the shape
doesnt bother me sir
just the goddamned
sweet stench
one standard
just treat me the same
no better no worse
youre gonna get
everything you want oneil
lets just see if you want
what youre gonna get
hooyah sir
hey

the hell out of it
uh the woman identity unknown
is believed to be
the first female candidate for
the elite navy seals training program
her presence could signal a shift
in the militarys
these were supposed to have been
discreet test cases
that was
the agreement
suppose this ladys getting friendly
with the press
its dehaven had to be she is gonna
milk this cow on all four tits
in the last two hours my office
has received 14 requests for interviews
no interviews
thats the last thing we need
where is she in the training
this woman
well have that information
for you before the nights out
its my understanding that she just
finished the pt phase of her training
she made it
through hell week
wont last one week
huh
so have you been monitoring
this situation for us commander
no sir i just made
some unofficial inquiries
well make it official

photographers traipse around your base
snapping their fill
these are supposed to be
discreet test cases
senator they stand out on a
public highway using telephoto lenses
there is nothin
i can do about it
unless you want me to infringe
on their civil liberties
which ill be glad to do if youll just
trim a little fat off the constitution
did you just mouth off to a senior
member of the senate arms committee
ill give you points for style
just nothin for smarts

to my chain of command
good
now hows my girl
doin anyway
you need to know
what it feels like to drown
in order
to avoid panic
and perhaps gain those few seconds
that just might save your life
the natural tendency
toward premature panic
is what makes this such an effective
interrogation technique
mama told me
not to come
that aint the way
to have fun no
uhuh
carb 15
military designator m4
nothing more than a choppeddown
version of the m16 assault rifle
by taking the proper
precautions

waterresistant

the technique developed in my time

navy says to him no you can only do
one thing on a battleship son
thats cook

100 years ago either

thanks man
the israelis
tried it
women in combat
seems the men couldnt get used
to the sight of women blown open
theyd linger over
the wounded females
often trying to save those
who obviously couldnt be saved
often to the detriment
of the mission
you were given
the navy cross right
can i ask
what you got it for
since it bears
on this conversation
i got it for pulling a 240pound man
out of a burning tank
so when a man tries to rescue
another man hes a hero
but when he tries to rescue a woman
hes just gone soft
could you have
pulled that man clear
you couldnt even haul your own
body weight out of the water today
permission to get dressed

40 percent of her peers

hey jordan i was
uh wondering
if you um
youre all right
i gotta get out of here
in a world of fire
really wouldnt want us
to fight for them
cause theyre
not even born
we cant even fight
for ourselves anymore
thats why
aint really none of my business
but i say leave the bastard
the future is a war
out the window
went the perfect past
a participle particle
an atom to smash
and smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again
didnt we used to
know ourselves when
didnt we ever
used to be friends
before a billion years
went down the drain and thats why
the future is a war
the future is a war
hey there hi
what happened where are the guys
well you know
i just wasnt into picking up chicks
wait a second
on a real world op
we always use backups
two is one
one is none
is that understood
yeah
oneil to co office
oneil the co wants
you in his office
hey
lieutenant theyre waiting
this is admiral gallow
and lieutenant burke
from the judge advocate
generals office
have a seat lieutenant
i dont know uh a delicate way
to say this lieutenant
so im not going to try
claims have been made
that you have uh
engaged in fraternization
of the same sex variety
specifically that you were
seen in public venues with another
female officer at a time and manner
as to suggest conduct
unbecoming an officer
sir is someone suggesting
that im a lesbian
were not asking
if you are lieutenant
and youre not required
to respond even if asked
this is merely an informal inquiry
where did you get these
the source of these photographs
is also a part of our investigation
i see they were
sent anonymously
sir id like to tell you that
this is completely groundless
and in no way did anything happen
with lt blondell and myself
i find this just as distasteful
as you lieutenant
you will be required
to cooperate with jag and nis
naturally you will be given a desk
pending the outcome
a desk
oh this is
captain obviously someone is trying
to sabotage my training
you may repeat your training
at a future date if cleared
i cant go through this shit again
ratchet down lieutenant
i would not choose
to repeat the training sir
nor do i care
to drive a desk
pending the outcome of
this malicious allegation
now i respectfully request you keep me
with my crew or you send me packing
that sounded dangerously
like an ultimatum
you take it as you will sir
dont worry
its me theyre after
i remember
holding on
all them long
and lonely nights
ive put you through
somewhere in there
im sure i made you cry
but i cant remember
if we said goodbye
hey
i couldnt get
the gas back on
i guess youve heard
yeah
more than i really wanted to
there was a time
i wanted you to fail
but it was only
so i could have you close
and safe
and all to myself
but youd be hell to live with
i love you
okay here it is
take a look at these
switch ya
now this was faxed
to the jag office tuesday
arrived on my desk
wednesday morning
what do you see
you see this
what do you see
take a look on the right
shit
thats right
how important is this
to you jordan
im just asking
im just asking
bridgeport naval base
wait look at this
in tennessee the board recommends
closing fort meyers
and the brantwood
air force supply depot
in texas the board is recommending
no closures of military bases
last week five bases in texas were
on the chopping block this week none
what does that tell you
in a manner equitable
to all states
while burdening no one state
with economic hardship
first and foremost
this commission worked
for the good of the country
of course we anticipate
some controversy
over our recommendations
but we remind everybody
senators congressmen
governors alike
uh excuse me mr burnham
now might be a dandy time
for that recess
till noon everyone
jordan i heard what happened
and i do so very much
want to talk with you
but now is scarcely the time
i commend you senator
those were very nice photos
yes we did have someone
taking shots
but for future
publicity purposes
i see so how did they end up
in the navys hands
well youll have to ask them that
if i have to ask
anyone again senator
ill be asking on cspan
jordan come on
here are the senators
case notes
let me have it boys
come on quickly quickly
close the door
jordan nearly every working day
im forced to make decisions
that would have solomon himself
shittin golf balls
and half of those decisions
are about political survival
i dont resent that
so if youve come here lookin for me
to apologize for keeping alive
you better pull up a chair
cause youre gonna be here for a while
tell me you didnt sell me out
tell me you didnt sink my whole career
to make you look good
those charges will be dismissed
your career will go forward
albeit back here in washington
oh come on dont tell me
you wanted that kind of life
squatpissing in some
thirdworld jungle
with some guys
looking up your behind
i wanted the choice
thats how its supposed to be
the truth is the choice isnt yours
and it isnt mine
american families
are just not prepared
to have their daughters
and young mothers in harms way
you dont know that
yes i do
roper paris gallup all the polls
they all come back the same way
what are you saying
that a womans life
is more valuable than a mans
that a womans death
is more hurtful than a mans
no politician can afford to let women
come home in body bags
especially me
it was never gonna happen anyway
then why the fuck did you start me
on all this in the first place
truthfully
i never expected you to do so damn well
i thought youd ring out in two weeks
bing bang its over
and were popular
in washington
you dont even need the ten commandments
if youre popular
i wonder what secretary hayes
would think about this
if he was to know
how you dealt me away
for bases for votes
what makes you think
he doesnt know
dont even think about playing politics
with me little darling
youll be up way past your bedtime
and dont you think that
i will stand idly by
while anyone smears
my good name
now you get those charges voided
senator and you do it today
or what
you like pissed off
watch this
jordan youre asking me
to unring a bell
i cannot do that
im not asking
think about what you do before you go in
front of cameras and embarrass yourself
you have no proof
accusations seem to be enough
you taught me that
jordan
hell of a game
of brinkmanship you play
im not playing games senator
i gather
ill do it
somehow ill get you back in
hey guys
guys come here take a look at this
look whos back in town

just to hide

each november
i break down and cry

if we said goodbye
i cant remember
if we said goodbye
ohhh
i cant remember
if we said goodbye
goodbye
the future is a war
out the window went
the perfect past
a participle particle
an atom to smash
and smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again
didnt we used to
know ourselves when
didnt we ever
used to be friends
before a billion years
went down the drain and thats why
the future is a war
losin already
losin everything
we got swastikas
hidden in magazines
sewed in the label
of your slavelabor clothes
and thats why
the future is a war
men prove worthy of our fears
their strength diminishes
more every year
as they side with the enemy
and throw down their spears
