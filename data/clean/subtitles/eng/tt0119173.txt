that supplies combat units 
the last few years have brought
real progress   
in the interests of women in
all aspects of naval service 
what s more  the navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses   
for all its male recruits 
demonstrating even more progress  
whoa  whoa  whoa 
mr  hayes 
if a cannibal used a knife and fork 
would you call that progress too 
well  perhaps  if i could just finish 
madame chairman  your questions  
oh  i m just an old dame
without much time left   
so you ll pardon me
if i jump right in here 
i m deeply concerned over the navy s
seemingly incontrovertible attitude   
toward women in the military 
case in point  the lark report 
uh  madame chairman  this is
an internal document of the u s  navy 
the navy s analysis of that f 14 crash
at coronado last year 
female aviator 
it just so happens 
you were party to this report 
am i right 
i am really not prepared
to go into an in depth  
if you are vying for the office
of the secretary of the navy  mr  hayes   
i d like to think
you were prepared for anything 
especially if you re lookin 
for my confirmation 
i m struck by the ill spirited
tenor of your report 
degrading remarks
by other aviators   
innuendo about her performance
in unrelated situations 
there s even a reference here to
her sexual activity the weekend prior 
these are not
unrelated circumstances 
in my seven years
on this committee   
i have never seen a downed aviator
treated like this  never 
i m deeply disturbed
by this report  mr  hayes 
not just what it bodes
for the future of women in the navy   
but your future as well 
do you expect to take criticism
for using this confirmation hearing   
as a pulpit
for women s rights 
look  nearly one quarter of
all jobs in the u s  military   
are still to this day off limits
to women  and that has gotta change 
what about those that say women aren t
suited for all jobs  they re physically weaker 
how strong do you have to be
to pull a trigger 
that was quick 
yeah  she did great 
are you kidding 
she s always great 
private meeting 
that s what we want 
are you worried about the next round
of base closures  senator 
  as long as it doesn t affect me 
  defense boys already called 
they want
a private meeting with you 
i ll act surprised 
senator  this is a contingency program
for 100 per cent integration 
if female candidates measure e up
in a series of test cases   
the d o d  will support full
integration within three year s time 
we get our man  you get
your gender  blind navy  senator 
surely you re e not gonna
balk at that 
i have to pick
the test cases 
the navy ll want approval
over the women 
  so i ll approve their approval 
  come on  senator 
let s concentrate on the steak
and not the peas 
if women measure e up to the men  they ve
got the job  that s what s on the table 
you re not having
second thoughts  are you 
  well  doug 
  congratulations  mr  secretary 
so  what program 
i d go c r t 
combined reconnaissance team 
seals 
sixty per cent dropout r ate 
no woman s gonna last a week 
i don t care who she is 
then i suggest
we start there 
good work 
hostile activity 
mined area 
i say again 
hostile activity  mined area 
maintaining holding action 
carrying one wounded 
extracting to new location
secondary p z  over 
bravo six  this is avalanche 
negative
on secondary rendezvous 
strongly suggest new location 
over 
stand by  avalanche 
will consult team leader 
  bravo six 
  go to sea level 
say again your last 
over 
bravo six  this is avalanche 
bravo six 
  we ve lost the horizon 
  bravo six 
  you didn t account for that 
  yes  sir  we did   
but we didn t count on the seal unit
being delayed for five hours   
and then exfiltrating
this close to this high terrain 
but keyhole 5 will be l o s 
in 18 minutes  sir 
launch base will need
that much time to key their gear 
advise launch base
accordingly  goldstein  now 
sir  i d recommend against it 
these are skilled operators 
they ve grasped their problem by now and
will take action to get back on line 
it s just a glitch
in the net changeover  sir 
i ll have it ironed out
momentarily 
advise launch base 
goldstein 
something to add 
lieutenant 
if we keep the primary satellite  the unit can
negotiate its way down to this plateau here 
reestablish comms 
it s a clear shot 
what about those two areas inland 
that s closer to their position 
but that s behind them 
they ll wanna keep moving
seaward  sir  yet find a spot   
that gives  em the line of sight
on the satellite 
this plateau here 
that s where i d head  sir 
last i checked  you were a topographic
analyst  not an operations specialist 
  why don t you just let it  
  if they have wounded   
they might be inclined
to stay put 
wait till the new bird
comes into l o s 
but they also know the tides are
slipping out under their recovery sub 
they ll hump their wounded out  they ll
reach this plateau in ten minutes 
make that nine now 
we can t switch the net  sir 
we ll be listening for them   
on the wrong channel
with the wrong crypto 
give it exactly nine minutes 
okay  let s see
what the cat dragged in 
they ve preapproved
all these candidates 
top scores  marksmanship 
distance runner  took fifth place
in some intra service marathon  age 27 
perfect  till they do
a chromosome check 
some impressive
fitness reps here 
holder of several records
for female power lifting 
is this the face you want to see
on the cover of newsweek 
she looks like the wife
of a russian beet farmer 
i like this one 
triathlon  winter sports 
olympic contender   
winner of the arlie burke
essay contest  works intel 
  too much of a think tank soldier 
  no  no  show me  show me 
well  this really is
top drawer   
with silk stockings inside 
  we ve waited about as long as we dare 
  do it 
change the net 
launch base 
this is n i c  control 
we re going to conduct
a net changeover   
to keyhole 5 at
the following coordinates 
this is bravo six 
still got six heartbeats here   
holding on some kind of plateau 
i say again  six passengers
looking for a ride home 
  we re good to go 
  belay my last 
copy that  maintain perimeter 
advise further hostile status 
  that was good headwork  lieutenant 
  well  thank you  sir 
i m glad we could get
involved and do some good 
now the problem is 
intel officers don t get involved 
we monitor  analyze 
you need to learn
the fine art of detachment  lieutenant 
excuse me  there s a call
from the sec nav s office 
  i ll take it inside 
  no  sir  excuse me 
lieutenant o neil 
the call s for you 
i ll take it inside 
thanks for holding 
i ll put you through 
i m thinking about redoing
the place 
it s beginning to remind me
of an old whorehouse over the years 
  good evening  ma am 
  good evening  lieutenant 
ma am  may i ask
what this is regarding 
  didn t they tell you 
  no  ma am 
well  this ll be a toot 
you read  i ll pour 
it s jus t a test case  jordan   
but if things work out 
if you can go the distance   
it could well change the military s
official policy on women in combat 
or  actually 
its official non policy 
begging your pardon 
senator   
but you do understand this
involves seal training 
i do 
i also understand   
that you applied for active duty
during the gulf war and got turned down 
yes  ma am  there was an intel slot
available aboard the u s s  polk   
but they told me that submarines
had no bathroom facilities for women 
  did that piss you off 
  yes  ma am  it did 
good  i like pissed off 
  sit down  lieutenant 
  yes  ma am 
have you got a man 
  ma am 
  at home 
fianc√©  steady beau  you know 
some kind of solid heterosexual 
i hate askin   but i don t want
this thing blowin  up in our faces   
if you happen to be battin 
for the other side 
yes  ma am  there s someone 
well  wonderful 
honey  come on   i survived jump school 
dive school and three brothers 
i think i can take care
of myself   
the only thing that scares me
are the sexual politics 
i m just not interested in being
some poster girl for women s rights 
  what 
  hmm 
  what 
  what 
you don t have anything
to say about this 
i guess i don t 
honey  this is just
a career opportunity 
you don t want me sleeping my way
to the top  do you 
but the seals  babe 
these guys are world class warriors 
they see you coming  
  i mean  
  i m aware they may not want me there 
   may not  
  yes 
they will eat corn flakes
out of your skull  okay 
to tell you the truth   
i don t get it 
i mean  you re doing
shit hot at intel  
why do you wanna go off
and play soldier girl for 
royce  we re the same age 
we entered the navy the same month 
which one of us
is wearing more ribbons 
oh  come on  this is just  cause
i got lucky during the gulf war 
yes  thank you   operational experience
is a key to advancement 
yet anyone with tits can t be on a sub 
can t be a seal  and don t even think  
hey  whoa 
if you made up your mind to do it  go 
you always do what you wanna do anyway 
don t ask my permission 
you wanna go off and live with a bunch of
cock swinging commandos for three months  
three months 
what if i make this and go operational
for three years  what then 
oh  man  did i just miss
a decade or something 
will i wait if you go off to war 
is that what you re asking me 
yeah  something like that 
exactly like that 
i didn t know i was gonna have to decide
the rest of my life tonight  jordan 
maybe we should just
let this happen 
get your dick back in here 
don t ask me to tell you how i m gonna
feel in three years  i don t know 
i mean  neither do you 
right up until you said that 
i thought i did 
carry on 
put it down  here we go 
lieutenant o neil
reporting for training  sir 
yes  of course 
please  lieutenant 
have a seat 
thank you  sir 
would you care for a beverage 
tea  soda 
  i m fine  sir 
  you sure 
well  we re still coming to
terms with the exact protocol   
for the integration
of our seal c r t  training 
  barber was my next stop  sir  i  
  don t worry about it 
as long as it s off your collar  out of
your eyes  that s all i m going to ask 
sir  i m not looking
for any special treatment 
we re not trying to change
your sex  lieutenant 
you ll have a separate bed 
a separate head 
if you have any special medical needs 
inform the infirmary 
if your classmates or a superior
acts in a harassing   
or otherwise unbecoming manner   
you are to inform me
immediately   
so that i can deal with it
immediately 
it may not always run smooth   
but we re trying to make it
as painless as possible 
thank you  sir  but i expect
a certain amount of pain 
  any questions 
  none at this time  sir 
then we re done  lieutenant 
yes  sir 
permission to speak  sir 
i m not here to make
some kind of statement 
i care about completing the training
and getting operational experience   
just like everyone else 
i suspect 
if you were like everyone else 
lieutenant   
i suspect we wouldn t be
making statements   
about not making statements   
would we 
  dismissed 
  aye aye  sir

the master chief 
lieutenant o neil requests
to speak to the master chief 
he s not home 
excuse me  master chief 
cortez finished ahead of me in group
two  but he failed and i didn t  why 
instructor pyro 
educate the lieutenant 
you received an automatic
30 second deduction   
which put you
under the wire 
it s called gender norming 
o neil 
it s standard procedure
for all females in physical training 
what  all females  
if i m the only one 
i think i should have
the choice 
stand at attention 
lieutenant o neil  when i want
your opinion  i ll give it to ya 
did you take this matter up
with my command master chief 
i believe you instructed me to come
directly to you  sir   
if i felt i was being
mistreated in any way 
oh 
all right  lieutenant 
i want names 
i want specific grievances 
permission
to speak frankly  sir 
it s you  sir 
  it started the moment i came here 
  oh  really 
it s the double standard 
the separate quarters 
the deferential treatment 
it s the way you practically pulled
my chair out for me when we first met 
because i was civil 
now you re complainin  
i can t afford civility  sir 
how am i supposed to fit in when
you ve got me set up as an outsider 
you ve given me
a different set of rules 
the answer is  i can t 
why don t you just issue me a
pink petticoat to wear around the base 
did you just have
a brain fart 
begging your pardon 
sir 
did you
just waltz in here   
and bark at your
commanding officer 
if so  i regard that
as a bona fide brain fart   
and i resent it
when people fart inside my office 
i think you ve resented me
from the start  sir 
what i resent 
lieutenant   
is some politician   
using my base
as a test tube   
for her grand
social experiment 
what i resent   
is the sensitivity
training   
that is now mandatory
for my men   
the ob gyn
i have to keep on staff   
just so someone can keep track
of your personal pap smears 
but most of all 
what i resent   
is your perfume   
however subtle it may be   
competin  with the aroma
of my fine  3 59 cigar   
which i will put out
this instant   
if the phallic nature of it
happens to offend   
your goddamned
fragile sensibilities

uh   the woman  identity unknown 
is believed to be   
 the first female candidate for
the elite navy seals training program 
her presence could signal a shift
in the military s   
these were supposed to have been
discreet test cases 
that was
the agreement 
suppose this lady s getting friendly
with the press 
it s dehaven  had to be  she is gonna
milk this cow on all four tits 
in the last two hours my office
has received 14 requests for interviews 
no interviews 
that s the last thing we need 
where is she in the training 
this woman

for you before the night s out 
it s my understanding that she just
finished the p t  phase of her training 
she made it
through hell week

this situation for us  commander

photographers traipse around your base

discreet test cases 
senator  they stand out on a
public highway using telephoto lenses

i can do about it

now  how s my girl
doin   anyway 
you need to know
what it feels like to drown   
in order
to avoid panic   
and perhaps gain those few seconds
that just might save your life 
the natural tendency
toward premature panic   
is what makes this such an effective
interrogation technique

counterparts in the elite navy program

he wanted to fire them big guns

navy says to him   no  you can only do
one thing on a battleship  son 
that s cook   
i m not talkin  about
100 years ago  either 
i m talkin  the united states navy 
middle of world war two

they gave him 
the reason why they told my grandfather
he couldn t fight for his country

  thanks  man 
the israelis
tried it 
women in combat 
seems the men couldn t get used
to the sight of women blown open 
they d linger over
the wounded females   
often trying to save those
who obviously couldn t be saved   
often to the detriment
of the mission 
you were given
the navy cross  right 
can i ask
what you got it for 
since it bears
on this conversation   
i got it for pulling a 240 pound man
out of a burning tank 
so when a man tries to rescue
another man  he s a hero   
but when he tries to rescue a woman 
he s just gone soft 
could you have
pulled that man clear 
you couldn t even haul your own
body weight out of the water today 
permission to get dressed

uh  wondering   
if you  um  
you re all right 
i gotta get out of here 
  in a world of fire  
  really wouldn t want us
to fight for them  
   cause they re
not even born  
  we can t even fight
for ourselves anymore  
  that s why  
ain t really none of my business 
but i say leave the bastard 
  the future is a war 
  out the window
went the perfect past  
  a participle  particle
an atom to smash  
  and smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again  
  didn t we used to
know ourselves when  
  didn t we ever
used to be friends  
  before a billion years
went down the drain and that s why  
  the future is a war 
  the future is a war   
hey  there  hi 
what happened  where are the guys 
well  you know 
i just wasn t into picking up chicks 
wait a second 
on a real world op 
we always use back ups 
two is one 
one is none 
  is that understood 
  yeah 
o neil to c o  office 
o neil  the c o  wants
you in his office 
  hey 
  lieutenant  they re waiting 
this is admiral gallow
and lieutenant burke   
from the judge advocate
general s office 
have a seat  lieutenant 
i don t know  uh  a delicate way
to say this  lieutenant   
so i m not going to try 
claims have been made
that you have  uh   
engaged in fraternization
of the same sex variety 
specifically that you were   
 seen in public venues with another
female officer at a time and manner   
as to suggest conduct
unbecoming an officer   
sir  is someone suggesting
that i m a lesbian 
we re not asking
if you are  lieutenant   
and you re not required
to respond even if asked 
this is merely an informal inquiry 
where did you get these 
the source of these photographs
is also a part of our investigation 
i see  they were
sent anonymously 
sir  i d like to tell you that
this is completely groundless   
and in no way did anything happen
with lt  blondell and myself 
i find this just as distasteful
as you  lieutenant 
you will be required   
to cooperate with jag and n i s 
naturally  you will be given a desk
pending the outcome 
a desk 
oh  this is  
captain  obviously someone is trying
to sabotage my training 
you may repeat your training   
at a future date  if cleared 
  i can t go through this shit again 
  ratchet down  lieutenant 
i would not choose
to repeat the training  sir   
nor do i care
to drive a desk   
pending the outcome of
this malicious allegation 
now  i respectfully request you keep me
with my crew or you send me packing 
that sounded dangerously
like an ultimatum 
you take it as you will  sir 
don t worry 
it s me they re after 
  i remember 
  holding on  
  all them long
and lonely nights  
  i ve put you through  
  somewhere in there  
  i m sure i made you cry  
  but i can t remember 
  if we said good bye   
hey 
i couldn t get
the gas back on 
i guess you ve heard 
yeah 
more than i really wanted to 
there was a time
i wanted you to fail   
but it was only
so i could have you close   
and safe   
and all to myself 
but you d be hell to live with 
i love you 
okay  here it is 
  take a look at these 
  switch ya 
now  this was faxed
to the jag office tuesday 
arrived on my desk
wednesday morning 
what do you see 
you see this 
what do you see 
take a look on the right 
  shit 
  that s right 
how important is this
to you  jordan 
i m just asking 
i m just asking 
  bridgeport naval base 
  wait  look at this 
in tennessee  the board recommends
closing fort meyers   
and the brantwood
air force supply depot 
in texas  the board is recommending
no closures of military bases 
last week  five bases in texas were
on the chopping block  this week  none 
what does that tell you 
   in a manner equitable
to all states   
while burdening no one state
with economic hardship 
first and foremost   
this commission worked
for the good of the country 
of course  we anticipate
some controversy   
over our recommendations 
but we remind everybody  
senators  congressmen   
  governors alike  
  uh  excuse me  mr  burnham 
now might be a dandy time
for that recess 
till noon  everyone 
jordan  i heard what happened   
and i do so very much
want to talk with you   
but now is scarcely the time 
i commend you  senator 
those were very nice photos 
yes  we did have someone
taking shots   
but for future
publicity purposes 
i see  so how did they end up
in the navy s hands 
well  you ll have to ask them that 
if i have to ask
anyone again  senator   
i ll be asking on c span 
jordan  come on 
here are the senator s
case notes 
let me have it  boys 
come on  quickly  quickly 
close the door 
jordan  nearly every working day
i m forced to make decisions   
that would have solomon himself
shittin  golf balls   
and half of those decisions
are about political survival 
i don t resent that 
so if you ve come here lookin  for me
to apologize for keeping alive   
you better pull up a chair 
 cause you re gonna be here for a while 
tell me you didn t sell me out 
tell me you didn t sink my whole career
to make you look good 
those charges will be dismissed 
your career will go forward 
albeit back here in washington 
oh  come on  don t tell me
you wanted that kind of life 
squat pissing in some
third world jungle   
with some guys
looking up your behind 
i wanted the choice 
that s how it s supposed to be 
the truth is  the choice isn t yours 
and it isn t mine 
american families
are just not prepared   
to have their daughters
and young mothers in harm s way 
  you don t know that 
  yes  i do 
roper  paris  gallup  all the polls 
they all come back the same way 
what are you saying 
that a woman s life
is more valuable than a man s 
that a woman s death
is more hurtful than a man s 
no politician can afford to let women
come home in body bags   
especially me 
it was never gonna happen anyway 
then why the fuck did you start me
on all this in the first place 
truthfully 
i never expected you to do so damn well 
i thought you d ring out in two weeks 
bing  bang  it s over 
and we re popular 
in washington   
you don t even need the ten commandments
if you re popular 
i wonder what secretary hayes
would think about this   
if he was to know
how you dealt me away   
for bases  for votes 
what makes you think
he doesn t know 
don t even think about playing politics
with me  little darling 
you ll be up way past your bedtime 
and don t you think that
i will stand idly by   
while anyone smears
my good name 
now  you get those charges voided 
senator  and you do it today 
or what 
you like pissed off 
watch this 
jordan  you re asking me
to unring a bell 
  i cannot do that 
  i m not asking 
think about what you do before you go in
front of cameras and embarrass yourself 
  you have no proof 
  accusations seem to be enough 
  you taught me that 
  jordan 
hell of a game
of brinkmanship you play 
i m not playing games  senator 
i gather 
i ll do it 
somehow  i ll get you back in 
hey  guys 
guys  come here  take a look at this

  the future is a war 
  out the window went
the perfect past  
  a participle  particle
an atom to smash  
  and smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again  
  didn t we used to
know ourselves when  
  didn t we ever
used to be friends  
  before a billion years
went down the drain and that s why  
  the future is a war 
  losin  already
losin  everything  
  we got swastikas
hidden in magazines  
  sewed in the label
of your slave labor clothes  
  and that s why  
  the future is a war 
  men prove worthy of our fears  
  their strength diminishes
more every year 
  as they side with the enemy
and throw down their spears
