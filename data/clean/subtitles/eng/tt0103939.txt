now tell me how else
uncle mack can make it up to you
i want to run me own show mack
i want control
dream on kid i know this business
and youre not that big
first time ive seen you miss mack
but charlie mack sennett
was the absolute king of comedy
he gave you your start
and how could you
just walk out and leave him flat
the reasons were
purely intellectual money
so you joined up with
bronco billy anderson
a puffedup cowboy star
not one of the high points of my career
but i knew i wanted my own studio
even then
i was putting money aside to build one
excuse me miss
do you always eat alone
only when im trying
to make a new acquaintance
actually im waiting for my girlfriend
actually im a motion picture director
and im forming a new company
with bronco billy over there
and youre looking for a new leading lady
lucky me
obviously you are an actress miss
purviance sorry just a secretary
dont be sorry im auditioning for
actresses who arent actresses
well if youre on the lookout for untalented
actresses who arent actresses
then you couldnt do better than me
worse than me
dont you want to know who i am
i have no interest whatsoever
in who you are
mr chaplin
cut not great uh
well do another
charlie if i eat one more bean
im going to be sick
you almost had it

no else one could do it this well
we both know it
ill do my best
right
how about dinner tonight chili con carne
ill kill you charlie
more beans
more beans
camera

good to know i can always
count on my nearest and dearest
dont come it with me son
arrival in the land of liberty
sticking in the statue like that
what are you playing at
nobody else seemed to mind
answer me
kicking an immigration officer
up the backside
do you think thats funny
well for those of us with
a sense of humor very
charlie
charlie it was supposed to be a comedy
now youve turned it
into a bloody political tract
were guests here
and you cant go around criticizing
the way its run
syd i love this country i owe it everything
thats precisely why i can criticize it
dont forget
why i must
where were from
theres a war on remember
now you make a million a year
while british boys are dying in france
the london papers are already after you
do you want the same thing to happen here
i registered for the draft
and they never called me
oh for christs sake
it isnt as if im hard to find
look im on your side kid
first one on board remember
be careful chas
just watch it
thats all im saying
there
you always said
you detested studio parties
oh the worst
but not where
doug fairbanks was concerned
life was fun when doug was around
as you know i dont think anyone today
remembers what a huge star he was
i mean back in the silent days he was huge
men liked him
women adored him
he was royalty
charles
look out below
sire you are most truly welcome
what a great party doug
isnt it fabulous
wonderful
thank you
may i take your coat sir
first class bet i hate it more than you do
i doubt it
of course
everything changed when
americas sweetheart came on the scene
you mean mary pickford
yes i always found her to be
something of an undersized bitch
but doug fell for her like a ton of bricks
hello charlie
hello mary
hi doug
hello
thanks for inviting me
mary its a pleasure
duty calls excuse me
hes a really lovely person charlie
yes hungry
hello charlie
her name is mildred harris
an actress
oh yeah a child actress
you ever hear the word jailbait charlie
thats the definition
id watch it if i was you
i value that mary
coming from you
when americas own sweetheart
gives you advice youd better listen
better listen thanks charlie
especially since youre married
and dougs married
and the two of you are rutting
with each other every afternoon
all the time pretending youve just met
miss pickford
mr chaplin please
lecture me more about morality
better better better
bitch better
i washed my face
come here
charlie what is it
i just need some
you just need some lip rouge
ive got some in my purse
its in the drawer over there its top right
look at me
is this what you want
yeah just put it on
my god charlie
you werent even 30
you were the most famous man in the world
you had your own studio named after you
i mean couldnt you just enjoy
mmm i can now
but i couldnt then it meant too much
morning
mr chaplin welcome
welcome charlie
take your picture charlie
chaplin
cut
all right hold it
i think perhaps
we should try a little less next time
hold it
hold the smoke
the dirt i mean for gods sake
somebody get me out of this thing
looks great charlie
but i thought i better keep the boys here
under control till you got out of costume
you are an ass
thank you
that wasnt bad charlie one more
check it
hows the light rollie
i know its better down at barneys bar
its better down at barneys bar
call it a day
i dont feel funny anymore
come on charlie lets go
not cheating are you fairbanks
you are a truly strange fellow charles
nonsense
facts indicate otherwise
close but out
and these facts show a young man
of what 29
not perhaps conventionally handsome
but certainly not repellent
flatteringly put
double fault lucky me
yes an unrepellant fellow of some fame
and fortune not totally without talent
ready
if only youd put one in play
call this one out
dont have to im winning
damn
and who is this fellow escorting
why mildred harris
that intellectual giant of 16
who still sucks her thumb
thats very funny
then why arent you laughing
perhaps because im marrying her
shes really not that bad
really not that bad
spoken like a man desperately in love
youre madder even than i thought charles
you sure its yours
i can only hope
there are ways of getting out of this
you know all it takes is money
where i come from thats not an option
besides i want a family and
i predict youre going to have one
before you know it
may i be the first to congratulate you
you may not
good
you didnt suspect about mildred
not for a moment
well why dont you add that
put that in
ill never forget the night
mary told me the truth
we were celebrating the end
of the first world war
and i met j edgar hoover for the first time
then i think
you should make it clear
that this was before
he became head of the fbi
if i may continue mr hearst
were too generous
were too open
now if we dont watch out
if we dont take steps now to impose
some new discipline some decency
then were in trouble deep trouble
i know its not fashionable to say this
were celebrating everyone thinks its over
but democracy carries a price tag
hear hear
and i just happen to think
that one of the most
misguided promises we ever made
was inscribed on the base
of the statue of liberty
one that i predict will lead this country
into all kinds of trouble
give us your poor your huddled masses
now we have to stop this
before it goes too far
our conception of america
does not include
was never meant to include
this kind of scum
you will have to forgive our famous
young friends the artistic temperament
but what youre saying is important
very important
right now we are giving sanctuary
to the refuse of the world
all kinds of leftwing intellectuals
whod like nothing more
than to bring us down
dont you think youre overstating
no sir i do not
and i sometimes wonder if you people
realize the responsibility you carry
to my way of thinking
motion pictures are potentially
the most influential form of communication
ever invented
and theres no control over them
your message reaches
everyone everywhere
message
of course
mr chaplin here reaches millions
who only have to see
and when they see a mockery being made
of our immigration services
i call that a message
yes well
as youve already said mr hoover
motion pictures are for the people
most of the people work for a living
and they dont make much money doing it
it gives them pleasure to see officialdom
and the upper classes
getting a kick up the backside
always has and it always will
and if that can change things
so much the better
better
hes improving
but motion pictures have made you rich
mr chaplin
they sure have
what about your own
motion picture career mrs chaplin
i think youve handled it all wonderfully
what
mildred
the pregnancy
everyone knows
youve been conned charlie
mildred
please excuse us mr hearst
i have to be up very early
yes of course
come along my dear
its been a pleasure
good night
you made an enemy there charlie
was it personal do you think
personal maybe
but im sure he really did believe
i was a communist
i wasnt of course i was simply a humanist
he also believed you were a jew
something ive rarely troubled
to deny mainly because of syd
hes halfjewish as you know
same mother different fathers
i suppose the false pregnancy
was the beginning of the end with mildred
youre awful late again charlie
id almost given up on you
funny
sometimes i feel im so close
to getting it right
it slips away
youve been editing that film for months
will be for months more than likely
not like the old days
the good times
the good times are they over
do you want me to leave
no
ill leave
why arent you
more bitter towards her
stealing my movie wasnt her idea
oh poor child was so stupid im not sure
she could even spell the word idea
charlie
charlie wake up
charlie
what
wake up quick
theyre trying to seize the film
who
just go and wash your face
and wake up will you
that sweet child bride of yours
well her divorce lawyers have informed her
its an asset
an asset
yes
so ive got rollie the wife
and 40 cans of film in the car come on
okay
once were over the state line
we keep you under wraps
till we finish cutting the film
charlie youve got your pants on
back to front
yeah yeah its good
it moves now
i really do love that kid

ive dreamed of this moment for years
this is america mum
this is where your dreams come true

mum mum
the mark on my arm charles
they gave me that at the asylum
if only id been able to feed you proper
id never have gone there
now if they ever come back for me
ill have enough food for us all
i never could deal with my mother
i only ever threw money at her
come on charlie
youve got to explain
why you chose that particular time
to go to london
now i dont have to explain a damn
thing i was tired i had a movie opening
i wanted to see old friends
straight into the water arse over tit
he needed the job that bad
but i was worried charlie
i was prepared for the absolute worst
ive seen it happen in the profession
oh so many times
mmm im sure you have mr karno
his head size
that is the only true measure of a man
i sent this lad to america
look whats come back to me
my head never swelled
not with all my successes
i was worried about you though charlie
and that other night at the troc remember
well you took a tailsuit
out of the wardrobe tried to be a gent
trying to impress that young dancer hetty
wasnt that her name
hetty kelly

so i decided to put down roots in america
whoa whoa
a man came to see me the other day
a corset salesman i sent him
your paunch is in need of help
he was the fbi old darling
said he knew what a loyal american i was
he wondered if everyone else
felt the same way
i just sat there and let him work his way
around to you
which he did
he asked were you a member
of the communist party
i said that was an absolute impossibility
because i love america
because youre too cheap to pay the dues
remarkable your timing in work is flawless
in life its the reverse
youre a miserable pain in the ass charles
but im worried about you
you worry about your family jewels
old darling
im serious
watch out
what am i supposed to watch
charles youre a foreigner
youre still an outsider
youve never understood this country
its a good country underneath doug
no its a good country on top
underneath thats what starts showing
when were scared
but you dont care about politics
what is this
why are you so worried
me
i havent a care in the world
im the oldest action star in the business
and talkies are coming

i still cant make him out
have you got a positive identification
oh yes no doubt sir it is hawkins sir
the red labor leader
visiting him at the studios
how can we make them realize the danger
i told him that once face to face
you can damage this country
he didnt get it
how old is this one
well sir shes underage is all that matters
when the babys born
we can go after him for statutory rape
a scandal like that would destroy him
i appreciate your zeal mr seeley
but chaplin and miss grey
were married in mexico yesterday
if only hed just sleep with them
everything would be so much easier
still we must do what we can
lita was your second wife okay
she gave you two sons whom you adored
this book is over 500 pages long
yet you only devote five lines to her why
i hated the bitch
oh come on
she was hardly more than a child
it cant all have been her fault surely
george she was
a profoundly flawed human being
well weve got to deal
with the problem charlie
you married her all your life
youve bedded down with the babies
your readers will want to understand
where were you when she gave birth
to those two boys less than a year apart
you know where i was
i happened to be making a little film
called the gold rush
youre a flawed human being charles
just like the rest of us
only you have to address it thats all
i mean why are we here
why are we talking in switzerland
and not in southern california hmm
it wasnt just
the parlor pink business charlie
or the speeches or the donations
that finally did you that
turned you into an exile
you know what i mean
nah
you know what it was dont you
what
sex
sex
yes sex
its odd you know but i dont think
ive ever looked at a woman
without measuring
that possibility between us
at the same time im not all that interested
never during work
i suppose it was only
when i wasnt working that i was
vulnerable
well why dont you write
about that vulnerability
if you want to understand me
watch my movies
all right sonny boy
tell your poor little brother todays problem
same as yesterday and the day before that
and the day before that
and the day before that

the tramp buys a flower from the girl
in order for the plot to work

hmm
ive always had that gift
after a man makes love to me
he just goes wild from happiness

now everyone realizes were married
were getting divorced
mans a wizard with women
no question about it
whos that man sounds german
looks german
probably one of those directors
theres a lot of them over here now
maybe hes got a job for me
just like plato
adolf hitler is defining the ideal state
which will become a model
for backward systems
do you know him personally
i do have that good fortune yes
and you have my word
our ambitions are only to defend
our historical frontiers to the east
thats paramount
told you paramount
its not funny doug
he merely wants to improve the situation
for the german people
create jobs
how can they let these fascist thugs
charlie
to cut out the profit speculator
the jew
mr chaplin i am a great admirer of yours
im sorry
i prefer not to shake hands with nazis
what have you got against us mr chaplin
what have you got against everybody else
you must forgive mr chaplin
hes a jew
ah so
im afraid i dont have that honor
shame on you
ah the former miss levy
shall we my dear
good night
god bless you charlie
uh ill call you
yes please do
all right good night
night
a lovely international incident
you caused in there
hey lets go on
not tonight old darling a bit tired
its funny you know you look a lot like him
adolf i mean
you know with your mustache on
i think he stole your act
good night old boy
night
sweet prince
so much ended around then
id been there 25 years
everybody else had gone over to sound
i didnt know how much longer
i could hold out against it
mario
of course ua was over for me
united artists
you know you havent written anything
about that how it began i mean
oh ill put something in
it was a great idea i think
creative people really had their say
for the first time
you like milk
no milk
i remember some distributor saying
the lunatics have taken over the asylum
that became quite a famous remark
yeah
thank you
but ua did mean a lot to doug
when my mother died it was sad yes but
she was old shed had her run
it was different with doug
even today i still miss him
oh yes tell me when did you actually
start work on the great dictator
38
38
and everyone thought you were crazy then
when the second world war broke out
you became a genius overnight
well not to those who thought
i was a communist
big smile
i know you you bastard
syd is that you
hmm
whats the matter syd
for 10 years youve been on at me
to make me a talkie now im making a talkie
yeah but not this
i know this man
were born the same year four days apart
hes like me capable of anything
nobody wants to see a film
about adolf fucking hitler
i do
youre missing the point
in the end its not about hitler
its about the tramp
the little jewish barber taking his place
charlie
whats happening in europe
is not our problem
90 of americans say
we should stay out of the war
thats nine out of 10
its not your business
youre a comic
yes syd and you are a jew
nevertheless
ive got to give it a try
otherwise what have i been doing
all these years
i know talking will be the end of the tramp
thats for sure
but at least hell go out
saying something i believe in
all right well see how it goes
roll camera
the great dictator scene y11a take one
im sorry but im not an emperor
i dont want to rule or conquer anyone
i should like to help everyone if possible
jew gentile black man white
we all want to help one another
human beings are like that
we want to live by each others happiness
not by each others misery
greed has poisoned mens souls
has barricaded the world with hate
has goosestepped us
into misery and bloodshed
do not despair
the hate of men will pass and dictators die
hes not talking about germany you know
he is talking about america that is
turn that goddamn thing down
soldiers dont
give yourselves to brutes
that is what we need
to make people understand
tell you what to do
what to think and what to feel
to drill you diet you treat you like cattle
and use you as cannon fodder
mr seeley youre looking a little pale
maybe its time you took a trip to california
comrades let us all fight for a new world
commie bastard
soldiers in the name of democracy
let us unite
so what brings you to california
oh i was sent by my firm
were planning on expanding our interest
in the movie business
although i really dont know
that much about it
quite a full house today sir
congratulations charlie
on the london opening
oh thank you
tea is on its way sir
good
lovely afternoon charlie thank you
sorry charlie
women drop handkerchiefs
i guess men drop other things
charlie
yes
charlie upper regional domes
immensely expansive
what
upper regional domes
immensely expansive
thats how you describe joan barry
in your book
she was very she was
wellendowed is that what you mean
yes
you honestly expect your readers
to believe that it wasnt just sex
well i didnt have to put a girl
under contract to sleep with her
i didnt exactly throw money around
i spent thousands on her
i wrote a screenplay for her
i dont care what the readers think
joan definitely had talent
she was intelligent she was pretty
she was willing to work hard
and the screen test proved
that she was very photogenic
but she became erratic
for whatever reason
she began to have some kind of breakdown
she took to driving up to my house
drunk in the middle of the night
she was arrested ran up debts
made scenes
in the end as ive explained i refused
to have anything further to do with her
how could you have been
such a fool charlie
you took up with a crazy girl
with umpteen different identities
was a promiscuous vengeful liar
and for perhaps the only time in your life
you didnt propose marriage
hoover had kept tabs on you for 20 years
and he still had no idea how to nail you
until you played
right into his hands by shutting joan out
youre improving frank
cant you find someone else
to play with
apparently not not anymore
whos that
ah the debutante
youre doing a favor for her agent
oh not another one that wants to act
its endless endless
this is the last time
they all think its so easy you know
i bet when she was 10
she wanted to be a fireman
tell you what you have half an hour
then get me out of it
some appointment
right
someone important
leave it to me
mr chaplin
im oona oneill
hi
my agent did say 300
but if im interrupting your game
i can always come back

and make it on their own
right
im sorry
i asked him to interrupt in case i was
i mean in case you were
ive never been to england
youre a good dancer
george lve just
written this for the end
for the last 20 years
i have known what happiness means
i wish i could write more about this
but it involves love
and perfect love is the most beautiful
of all frustrations
because it is more than one can express
excuse me
excuse me sir
yes henry
im sorry for the intrusion sir
no its all right come in come in
what is it henry
well im not quite sure sir
i just took a call from miss barry sir
she wanted me to tell you sir
that shes pregnant sir
i never um before i started
wheres mr charles
with harry
oh he may be on the stage by now
mr charles he down there
charlie okay
shell drop the paternity suit
i just talked to her lawyers shell settle
no
what
well just listen
shell take 150000
and thats nothing not compared to a trial
she says you did it at christmas
when she came to your house
morning mary
good morning
kid ive been making deals for you
all our lives
ive never made one this good
it was over long before christmas
it cant be my child
just get it out of the way
i cant do that
ive got oona to think of now
syd ive got to prove my innocence
look im all for proving your innocence kid
but how
go back to them
i beg you
get them to agree to a blood test
so that night
when you went to his house
did you and mr chaplin
have sexual relations
doesnt it look like it
never mind what it looks like
did you have sexual relations
with mr chaplin
she just said she did why else
would she agree to the blood tests
the next morning he just called a cab
paid me off
he wanted somebody younger classier
didnt he
hello
yes
yes
yes thank you
its all over
the blood test prove its not my baby
right lets just forget all this newfangled
rubbish about blood tests
lets put it out of our minds
his honor has ruled them inadmissible
what is important now
is the financial future of this poor child
it is her future the state of california
is here to protect
it makes me mad
to watch the way this fellow
tries to put it over us simpletons
this great star of stage and screen
this alien
who has enjoyed the hospitality
of our country for nearly 30 years
without ever once ever once
deigning to apply for american citizenship
but what good
has all this money done chaplin
wasting his substance in debauching girls
what good has it done the country
this is the kind of stuff
that makes for communism
now my client on the other hand
is alas
no more moral than chaplin
yes yes theyre both equally guilty
only chaplin is old enough to be her father
prowling around with girls that age
members of the jury use your godgiven
common sense and just look at this man
this cheap cockney cad
this
little tramp
and then take a very good look
at innocent little carol ann
i defy you not to see the resemblance
gentlemen and ladies
wives and mothers around the country
are watching you
watching to see you stop chaplin
in his tracks
youll sleep well
the night you give this baby a name
the night you show this lecher
that the law means him
as well as the bums on skid row
its a starstudded evening here
here is charlie chaplin
with his lovely wife oona
there goes mrs chaplin
looking gorgeous this evening
on the arm of her famous husband
are you a communist mr chaplin
are you a fellow traveler
mr chaplin
are you going to attend
the mccarthy hearing
gentlemen gentlemen please
mr chaplin
mr chaplin has repeatedly said
hell go whenever they call him
and even even if there were only
one communist in the state department
even if there were only one communist
in the state department
that would still be one communist too many
mr lawson are you
a member of the communist party
or have you ever been
a member of the communist party
its unfortunate and tragic
that i have to teach this committee
the basic principles of americanism
thats not the question
thats not the question
the question is have you ever been
a member of the communist party
im framing my answer in
the only way in which any american citizen
can frame his answer to a question
which absolutely invades his
then you refuse to answer
that question is that correct
i have told you
that i will offer my beliefs
i have written americanism
stand away from the stand
for many years and i shall continue
stand away from the stand
to fight for the bill of rights
which you are seeking to destroy
officer take this man
away from the stand
id love to get away for a while darling
maybe after this bundle arrives
we could take the children and go
sir
sir
weve just got word
chaplins off to london on vacation
kk
mummy mummy
where did you leave mr chaplin
we left him back there at the stern
mummy
its all right darling
charlie
charlie
what what is it sweetheart
is it syd
no
what is it
theyve thrown you out
thrown me out thrown me out of what
of america
im so sorry
i cant go back

charlie
there are nights
its still hard being in exile
im sure they wouldnt
refuse you a visa now charles
have you never thought of going back
why dont we all go inside
i have everything i need right here
but its cold
i like the cold
i have to go anyway
telephone
charlie i heard the first three rings
thank you
no george in answer to your question
im used to invitations
ah yes
well its been a long day charlie
yes you must be very tired
come on george finish it off
the question mark
whats it all about
you mean that
yes
well it was a personal matter really
nothing relevant
tell me
all right
the madness
i just wondered how much did it affect you
what makes you think it did
well your mother was certified insane
yes
and your grandmother
was certified insane as well and
yes
thats not what dogged me george
it wasnt that
it was
it was the knowledge that if you did
what i did for a living if you were a clown
and you had a passion
to tell a particular kind of story
something
beyond
but you only have the one chance
to get it right
and i never did
one never does but you know that
thats not the problem
its when you feel youre getting really close
but you cant make it the rest of the way
youre not good enough
youre not complete enough
and despite all your fantasies
youre secondrate
charlie
human
thats very hard
why didnt you add that
its not important really
end of the day
youre not judged by what you didnt do
but by what you did
and i didnt change things i just
he just
cheered people up
not bad that
charlie
charlie
charlie dear
i dreamed i was answering questions
for george silly
charlie that was california calling again
you really do have to give them an answer
no they took 20 years
to make up their mind
i can take another afternoon
enough enough
what if they still hate me
live from los angeles the 44th
annual academy awards presentation
suppose they start throwing things
now that would be a story
you never know on the stage
hmm i can see the headlines now
amazing incident at academy awards
chaplin disappears
under avalanche of oscars
mr walter matthau
oh look darling its walter
does that make you happy
no
crabby
oh i should never have let them
show those film clips i never
people wont like them
theyll think theyre old
well they are old
well over 50 years some of them
you know the worst thing about age
you cant defend yourself
when i was young handsome
had my power
if they came after me id make a movie
and make them laugh and id make them cry
now im at their mercy
come in
go away
were ready for you mr chaplin
this is a historic milestone
in the life of the academy
behave yourself
i would like to present the president
of the academy mr daniel taradash
now remember the president
of the academy mr daniel taradash
taradash
yes
sounds like a spice
the inscription reads
to charles chaplin
for the incalculable effect
he has had in making motion pictures
the art form of this century
humor heightens our sense of survival
and preserves our sanity
these are the words of charlie chaplin
the abiding elements
of chaplins artistic conscience
as actor writer director
and to quote wc fields
the greatest ballet dancer that ever lived
a few years ago mr chaplin said
my only enemy is time
we respectfully disagree
im going to leave you here darling
my white dress remember
they mustnt see anyone
till the clips are over
some unfathomable future
on some faraway star
