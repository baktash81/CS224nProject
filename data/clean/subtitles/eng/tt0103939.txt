if you ll pardon me for saying so 
charlie  charlie  i ve been so rotten to you 
i don t know if you can forgive me 
i forced you to leave butte  montana 
i made you accept  150 per 
you mentioned directing

now  tell me how else
uncle mack can make it up to you 
i want to run me own show  mack 
i want control 
dream on  kid  i know this business 
and you re not that big 
first time i ve seen you miss  mack 
but  charlie  mack sennett
was the absolute king of comedy 
he gave you your start 
and how could you
just walk out and leave him flat 
the reasons were
purely intellectual  money 
so  you joined up with
 bronco billy  anderson 
a puffed up cowboy star 
not one of the high points of my career 
but i knew i wanted my own studio 
even then 
i was putting money aside to build one 
excuse me  miss 
do you always eat alone 
only when i m trying
to make a new acquaintance 
actually  i m waiting for my girlfriend 
actually  i m a motion picture director 
and i m forming a new company
with bronco billy over there 
and you re looking for a new leading lady 
lucky me 
obviously  you are an actress  miss   
purviance  sorry  just a secretary 
don t be sorry  i m auditioning for
actresses who aren t actresses 
well  if you re on the lookout for untalented
actresses who aren t actresses 
then you couldn t do better than me 
worse than me 
don t you want to know who i am 
i have no interest whatsoever
in who you are 
mr  chaplin 
cut  not great  uh   
we ll do another 
charlie  if i eat one more bean 
i m going to be sick 
you almost had it 
but this time not quite so daintily 
you re starving 
i know 
but it s hard to be hungry after 46 takes 
of course it is 
no else one could do it this well 
we both know it 
  i ll do my best 
  right 
how about dinner tonight  chili con carne 
i ll kill you  charlie 
more beans

 arrival in the land of liberty  
sticking in the statue like that 
what are you playing at 
nobody else seemed to mind 
answer me 
kicking an immigration officer
up the backside 
do you think that s funny 
well  for those of us with
a sense of humor  very 
charlie 
charlie  it was supposed to be a comedy 
now  you ve turned it
into a bloody political tract 
we re guests here 
and you can t go around criticizing
the way it s run 
syd  i love this country  i owe it everything 
that s precisely why i can criticize it 
  don t forget   
  why i must 
   where we re from 
there s a war on  remember

look  i m on your side  kid 
first one on board  remember 
be careful  chas 
just watch it 
that s all i m saying 
there 
you always said
you detested studio parties 
oh  the worst 
but not where
doug fairbanks was concerned 
life was fun when doug was around 
as you know  i don t think anyone today
remembers what a huge star he was 
i mean  back in the silent days  he was huge 
men liked him 
women adored him 
he was royalty 
charles

  isn t it fabulous 
  wonderful 
  thank you 
may i take your coat  sir 
first class  bet i hate it more than you do 
i doubt it 
of course
everything changed when
america s sweetheart came on the scene 
you mean mary pickford 
yes  i always found her to be
something of an undersized bitch 
but doug fell for her like a ton of bricks 
  hello  charlie 
  hello  mary 
  hi  doug

mary  it s a pleasure 
duty calls  excuse me

i value that  mary 
coming from you 
when america s own sweetheart
gives you advice  you d better listen 
 better listen   thanks  charlie 
especially since you re married
and doug s married 
and the two of you are rutting
with each other every afternoon
  all the time pretending you ve just met 
  miss pickford 
mr  chaplin  please 
lecture me more about morality 
better  better  better 
bitch  better

you are a truly strange fellow  charles 
  nonsense 
  facts indicate otherwise 
close  but out 
and these facts show a young man 
of what  29 
not perhaps conventionally handsome 
but certainly not repellent 
flatteringly put 
double fault  lucky me 
yes  an unrepellant fellow of some fame
and fortune  not totally without talent 
ready 
if only you d put one in play 
call this one out 
don t have to  i m winning 
damn 
and who is this fellow escorting 
why  mildred harris 
that intellectual giant of 16
who still sucks her thumb 
that s very funny 
then why aren t you laughing 
perhaps because i m marrying her 
she s really not that bad 
 really not that bad  
spoken like a man desperately in love 
you re madder even than i thought  charles 
you sure it s yours 
i can only hope 
there are ways of getting out of this 
you know  all it takes is money 
where i come from  that s not an option 
besides  i want a family and   
i predict you re going to have one
before you know it 
may i be the first to congratulate you 
you may not 
good 
you didn t suspect about mildred 
not for a moment 
well  why don t you add that 
put that in 
i ll never forget the night
mary told me the truth 
we were celebrating the end
of the first world war 
and i met j  edgar hoover for the first time 
then i think
you should make it clear
that this was before
he became head of the fbi 
if i may continue  mr  hearst 
we re too generous 
we re too open 
now  if we don t watch out 
if we don t take steps now to impose
some new discipline  some decency 
then we re in trouble  deep trouble 
i know it s not fashionable to say this 
we re celebrating  everyone thinks it s over 
  but democracy carries a price tag 
hear  hear 
and i just happen to think
that one of the most
misguided promises we ever made
was inscribed on the base
of the statue of liberty 
one that i predict will lead this country
into all kinds of trouble 
 give us your poor  your huddled masses   
now  we have to stop this
before it goes too far 
our conception of america
does not include 
was never meant to include 
this kind of scum 
you will have to forgive our famous 
young friends  the artistic temperament 
but what you re saying is important 
very important 
right now we are giving sanctuary
to the refuse of the world 
all kinds of left wing intellectuals
who d like nothing more
than to bring us down 
don t you think you re overstating 
no  sir  i do not 
and i sometimes wonder if you people
realize the responsibility you carry 
to my way of thinking 
motion pictures are  potentially 
the most influential form of communication
ever invented 
and there s no control over them 
your message reaches
everyone  everywhere 
message 
of course 
mr  chaplin here reaches millions
who only have to see 
and when they see a mockery being made
of our immigration services 
i call that a message 
yes  well 
as you ve already said  mr  hoover 
motion pictures are for the people 
most of the people work for a living
and they don t make much money doing it 
it gives them pleasure to see officialdom
and the upper classes
getting a kick up the backside 
always has and it always will 
and if that can change things 
so much the better 
better 
he s improving 
but motion pictures have made you rich 
mr  chaplin 
they sure have 
what about your own
motion picture career  mrs  chaplin 
  i think you ve handled it all wonderfully 
  what 
mildred 
the pregnancy 
everyone knows
you ve been conned  charlie 
mildred 
please excuse us  mr  hearst 
i have to be up very early 
  yes  of course 
  come along  my dear 
it s been a pleasure 
good night 
you made an enemy there  charlie 
was it personal  do you think 
personal  maybe 
but i m sure he really did believe
i was a communist 
i wasn t  of course  i was simply a humanist 
he also believed you were a jew 
something i ve rarely troubled
to deny  mainly because of syd 
he s half jewish  as you know 
same mother  different fathers 
i suppose the false pregnancy
was the beginning of the end with mildred 
you re awful late again  charlie 
i d almost given up on you 
funny 
sometimes i feel i m so close
to getting it right 
it slips away 
you ve been editing that film for months 
will be for months  more than likely 
not like the old days 
the good times 
the good times  are they over 
do you want me to leave 
no 
i ll leave 
why aren t you
more bitter towards her 
stealing my movie wasn t her idea 
oh  poor child was so stupid  i m not sure
she could even spell the word  idea   
charlie 
charlie  wake up 
  charlie 
  what 
wake up  quick 
  they re trying to seize the film 
  who 
just go and wash your face
and wake up  will you 
that sweet child bride of yours 
well  her divorce lawyers have informed her
it s an asset 
  an asset 
  yes 
so  i ve got rollie  the wife
  and 40 cans of film in the car  come on 
  okay 
once we re over the state line 
we keep you under wraps
till we finish cutting the film

thing  i was tired  i had a movie opening 
i wanted to see old friends 
straight into the water  arse over tit 
he needed the job that bad 
but i was worried  charlie 
i was prepared for the absolute worst 
i ve seen it happen in the profession 
oh  so many times 
mmm  i m sure you have  mr  karno 
his head size 
that is the only true measure of a man 
i sent this lad to america 
look what s come back to me 
my head never swelled 
not with all my successes 
i was worried about you  though  charlie 
and that other night at the troc  remember 
well  you took a tail suit
out of the wardrobe  tried to be a gent 
trying to impress that young dancer  hetty 
wasn t that her name 
hetty kelly 
i could see in your eyes you fancied her 
sad

she got married 
sent me a lovely note 
brought it with me 
somewhere in my baggage 
oh  charlie  charlie 
charlie  don t you know

the flu epidemic after the war
carried her away 
well  i thought someone must have told you

the back way s through there  sir 
oh  you re very kind 
good old charlie 
see him coming in here 
charlie chaplin 
welcome home  charlie 
i knew then that i had no home 
so i decided to put down roots in america 
whoa  whoa 
a man came to see me the other day 
a corset salesman  i sent him 
your paunch is in need of help 
he was the fbi  old darling 
said he knew what a loyal american i was 
he wondered if everyone else
felt the same way 
i just sat there and let him work his way
around to you 
which he did 
he asked were you a member
of the communist party 
i said that was an absolute impossibility 
because i love america 
because you re too cheap to pay the dues 
remarkable  your timing in work is flawless 
in life  it s the reverse 
you re a miserable pain in the ass  charles 
but i m worried about you 
you worry about your family jewels 
old darling 
i m serious 
watch out 
what am i supposed to watch 
charles  you re a foreigner 
you re still an outsider 
you ve never understood this country 
it s a good country underneath  doug 
no  it s a good country on top 
underneath  that s what starts showing
when we re scared 
but you don t care about politics 
what is this 
  why are you so worried 
  me 
i haven t a care in the world 
i m the oldest action star in the business
and talkies are coming 
what the hell
have i got to be worried about 
that s talkies  charles 
talkies  talkies 
can you imagine the tramp talking 
it s the future  charlie 
not in my lifetime 
talkies 
it ll never catch on 
talkies 
talkies 
talkies  talkies 
this is it  sir  we ve enlarged it for you 
i still can t make him out 
have you got a positive identification 
oh  yes  no doubt  sir  it is hawkins  sir 
the red labor leader 
visiting him at the studios 
how can we make them realize the danger 
i told him that once  face to face 
 you can damage this country   
he didn t get it 
how old is this one 
well  sir  she s underage is all that matters 
when the baby s born 
we can go after him for statutory rape 
a scandal like that would destroy him 
i appreciate your zeal  mr  seeley 
but chaplin and miss grey
were married in mexico yesterday 
if only he d just sleep with them 
everything would be so much easier 
still  we must do what we can 
lita was your second wife  okay 
she gave you two sons  whom you adored 
this book is over 500 pages long 
yet  you only devote five lines to her  why 
i hated the bitch 
oh  come on 
she was hardly more than a child 
it can t all have been her fault  surely 
george  she was
a profoundly flawed human being 
well  we ve got to deal
with the problem  charlie 
you married her  all your life 
you ve bedded down with the babies 
your readers will want to understand 
where were you when she gave birth
to those two boys less than a year apart 
you know where i was 
i happened to be making a little film
called the gold rush 
you re a flawed human being  charles 
just like the rest of us 
only  you have to address it  that s all 
i mean  why are we here 
why are we talking in switzerland
and not in southern california  hmm 
it wasn t just
the parlor pink business  charlie 
or the speeches or the donations
that finally did you that
turned you into an exile 
you know what i mean 
nah 
  you know what it was  don t you 
  what 
sex 
sex 
yes  sex 
it s odd  you know  but i don t think
i ve ever looked at a woman
without measuring
that possibility between us 
at the same time  i m not all that interested 
never during work 
i suppose it was only
when i wasn t working  that i was
vulnerable 
well  why don t you write
about that vulnerability 
if you want to understand me 
watch my movies 
all right  sonny boy 
tell your poor little brother today s problem 
same as yesterday and the day before that
and the day before that 
and the day before that 
and the day before that 
all right  you be creative for a change 
the tramp buys a flower from the girl 
in order for the plot to work 
she has to think he s rich 
that s all 
except  as you re aware 
the flower girl is blind 
i don t know how to make a blind girl
mistake the tramp for a millionaire 
easy 
we ll do what everyone else is doing 
joe 
we ll have the actors talk 
joseph curb  vitaphone 
  hello  sir 
  oh  hello  joe 
it s not your fault  son 
you re in the middle of a family feud 
now  you decide who s right 
the tramp can t talk 
the minute he talks  he s dead 
tell me i m right 
he can t  because you re wrong 
who the hell is gonna pay to see you 
when everybody else
has gone over to sound 
who  i ll tell you who 
the japanese  for one thing 
and the russkies for another 
and anyone else
who doesn t happen to speak english 
or have you forgotten
about the other nine tenths of the globe 
all right  i guess i ll have to show you 
who s the most famous ballet dancer
in the world 
pardon 
the most famous ballet dancer in the world 
nijinsky 
fine  so let s say that
he was doing swan lake today
and we all went to see it 
and he came down to the footlights 
and the orchestra stopped 
and he said   hi folks  i m vaslav nijinsky   
no  he d have a russian accent 
 hi  folksies  call me
vaslav nijinsky  sky  sky  sky 
 oh  just call me vas 
it doesn t matter  it s okay by me 
 everything is wonderful in california 
 okay  today i m going to jump
up and down for you
 like nothing what you ve ever seen before 
 hope you for to like me  bye   
you know what would happen
when he danced 
it would be awful 
because the magic is gone 
just as it would be with the tramp 
tell me i m right 
i m in the word business  mr  chaplin 
so i have to say that you re wrong 
but i m sure as hell glad
i got a chance to meet you

when she hears the door slam
on a rich man s car 
she thinks the tramp s the owner

i lived in the lap of luxury  but i was blind 
blind 
yes  that s fatal  for a storyteller 
did i ever tell you that i sold
all my stocks and shares
the year before the wall street crash 
that was clever 
it was deeply cruel  the depression 
can i have an autograph  mr  chaplin 
  yes  yes  of course 
  sign mine 
yes 
i wish they d wanted my money 
  you know what 
  hmm 
i ve always had that gift 
after a man makes love to me 
he just goes wild from happiness 
i am happy 
then tell me when you get sad 
because i don t want to be around 
terrible things have been
happening out there since the crash 
millions of decent americans have been
robbed of their right to work 
machinery is replacing manpower 
and i ve said nothing 
shame on me 
shame on me 
you re right  charlie  you re right 
about three seconds too short 
okay  johnny  we ll do a two bar repeat
of the xylophone  yes

honey 
oh  sorry  darling 
i m taking the boys out on the boat today 
why don t you come on out for some air

  what do you want to do 
  take it out of the minor key 
fine  let me hear it

charlie  you were supposed to meet us
at the fight 
i m sorry  sweetheart  who was fighting 
mostly mary and doug  as it turned out 
  you re wonderful  miss goddard 
  thanks 
well  that didn t work either  did it 
well  the fairbanks are getting a divorce 
and mussolini has invaded abyssinia 
you really need a break  charlie 
we should take a trip 
that s a good idea 
what  what s a good idea 
around the world  i thought 
i m not going to make it 
charlie 
did you lose your other wives this way 
i think so 
but you d have to ask them 
paulette  she was wonderful 
her personality  you mean 
no 
you mean in bed 
no  well  that was good 
no  she s the only one
who didn t take me for a fortune 
here  let me help you  come on 
okay 
i know you so well  charlie 
i even know what you re thinking 
you re thinking of doug  aren t you 
i was the only one who knew 
don t say daddy doesn t look after you 
  paulette 
  doug 
mr  chaplin  always a pleasure 
  how are you  oh 
  fine 
how do you look even prettier 
nobody s fine and everybody needs a drink 
paulette  another champagne or a scotch 
ooh  scotch  please 
  is he   
  yes 
seriously 
  his heart 
  shit

don t laugh 
i m going to test for scarlett 
why should i laugh 
because it s a joke 
everybody s testing for scarlett 
mmm hmm 
anyway  i hear katie hepburn
has it locked away  so they say 
i have not worked since modern times 
no  neither have i 
no ideas  i m desperate 
catch you later 
i can manage a double if i have to 
should you 
say  are you two still married or what 
i find it all very confusing  hmm 
hmm  it s not at all confusing 
see  when everyone thought
that we were having an affair 
we were married 
now everyone realizes we re married 
we re getting divorced 
man s a wizard with women 
no question about it 
who s that man  sounds german 
  looks german 
probably one of those directors 
there s a lot of them over here now 
maybe he s got a job for me 
just like plato 
adolf hitler is defining the ideal state
which will become a model
for backward systems 
do you know him personally 
i do have that good fortune  yes 
and you have my word 
our ambitions are only to defend
our historical frontiers to the east 
that s paramount 
told you  paramount 
it s not funny  doug 
he merely wants to improve the situation
for the german people 
create jobs   
  how can they let these fascist thugs   
  charlie   
   to cut out the profit speculator 
the jew 
mr  chaplin  i am a great admirer of yours 
i m sorry 
i prefer not to shake hands with nazis 
what have you got against us  mr  chaplin 
what have you got against everybody else 
you must forgive mr  chaplin 
  he s a jew 
  ah  so 
i m afraid i don t have that honor 
shame on you 
ah  the former miss levy 
shall we  my dear 
  good night 
  god bless you  charlie 
  uh  i ll call you 
  yes  please do 
  all right  good night 
  night 
a lovely international incident
you caused in there 
hey  let s go on 
not tonight  old darling  a bit tired 
it s funny  you know  you look a lot like him 
adolf  i mean 
you know  with your mustache on 
i think he stole your act 
good night  old boy 
night 
sweet prince 
so much ended around then 
i d been there 25 years 
everybody else had gone over to sound 
i didn t know how much longer
i could hold out against it 
mario 
of course  ua was over for me 
united artists 
you know  you haven t written anything
about that  how it began  i mean 
oh  i ll put something in 
it was a great idea  i think 
creative people really had their say
for the first time 
  you like milk 
  no milk 
i remember some distributor saying 
 the lunatics have taken over the asylum   
  that became quite a famous remark 
  yeah 
thank you 
but ua did mean a lot to doug 
when my mother died  it was sad  yes  but   
she was old  she d had her run 
it was different with doug 
even today  i still miss him 
oh  yes  tell me  when did you actually
start work on the great dictator 
   38 
   38 
and everyone thought you were crazy then 
when the second world war broke out 
you became a genius overnight 
well  not to those who thought
i was a communist 
big smile 
i know you  you bastard 
syd  is that you 
hmm 
what s the matter  syd 
for 10 years  you ve been on at me
to make me a talkie  now i m making a talkie 
yeah  but not this 
i know this man 
we re born the same year  four days apart 
he s like me  capable of anything 
nobody wants to see a film
about adolf fucking hitler 
i do 
you re missing the point 
in the end  it s not about hitler 
it s about the tramp 
  the little jewish barber taking his place 
  charlie 
what s happening in europe
is not our problem 
90  of americans say
we should stay out of the war 
that s nine out of 10 
it s not your business 
you re a comic 
yes  syd  and you are a jew 
nevertheless 
i ve got to give it a try 
otherwise  what have i been doing
all these years 
i know talking will be the end of the tramp 
that s for sure 
but at least he ll go out
saying something i believe in 
all right  we ll see how it goes 
roll camera 
the great dictator  scene y 11 a  take one 
i m sorry  but i m not an emperor 
i don t want to rule or conquer anyone 
i should like to help everyone  if possible 
jew  gentile  black man  white 
we all want to help one another 
human beings are like that 
we want to live by each other s happiness 
not by each other s misery 
greed has poisoned men s souls 
has barricaded the world with hate 
has goose stepped us
into misery and bloodshed 
do not despair 
the hate of men will pass  and dictators die 
he s not talking about germany  you know 
he is talking about america  that is   
turn that goddamn thing down 
soldiers  don t
give yourselves to brutes 
that is what we need
to make people understand 
   tell you what to do 
what to think and what to feel 
to drill you  diet you  treat you like cattle
and use you as cannon fodder 
mr  seeley  you re looking a little pale 
maybe it s time you took a trip to california 
comrades  let us all fight for a new world 
commie bastard 
soldiers  in the name of democracy 
let us unite 
  so what brings you to california 
  oh  i was sent by my firm 
we re planning on expanding our interest
in the movie business 
although i really don t know
that much about it 
quite a full house today  sir 
congratulations  charlie 
on the london opening 
oh  thank you 
  tea is on its way  sir 
  good 
lovely afternoon  charlie  thank you 
sorry  charlie 
women drop handkerchiefs 
i guess men drop other things 
  charlie 
  yes 
charlie  upper regional domes
immensely expansive 
what 
upper regional domes 
immensely expansive 
that s how you describe joan barry
in your book 
she was very    she was
well endowed  is that what you mean 
yes 
you honestly expect your readers
to believe that it wasn t just sex 
well  i didn t have to put a girl
under contract to sleep with her 
i didn t exactly throw money around 
i spent thousands on her 
i wrote a screenplay for her 
i don t care what the readers think 
joan definitely had talent 
she was intelligent  she was pretty 
she was willing to work hard 
and the screen test proved
that she was very photogenic 
but she became erratic 
for whatever reason 
she began to have some kind of breakdown 
she took to driving up to my house 
drunk  in the middle of the night 
she was arrested  ran up debts 
made scenes 
in the end  as i ve explained  i refused
to have anything further to do with her 
how could you have been
such a fool  charlie 
you took up with a crazy girl
with umpteen different identities 
was a promiscuous  vengeful liar 
and for  perhaps  the only time in your life 
you didn t propose marriage 
hoover had kept tabs on you for 20 years 
and he still had no idea how to nail you
until you played
right into his hands by shutting joan out 
you re improving  frank 
can t you find someone else
to play with 
apparently not  not anymore 
  who s that 
  ah  the debutante 
you re doing a favor for her agent 
oh  not another one that wants to act 
it s endless  endless 
this is the last time 
they all think it s so easy  you know 
i bet when she was 10 
she wanted to be a fireman 
tell you what  you have half an hour 
then get me out of it 
  some appointment 
  right 
  someone important 
  leave it to me 
mr  chaplin 
i m oona o neill 
hi 
my agent did say 3 00 
but if i m interrupting your game 
i can always come back

george  l ve just
written this for the end 
for the last 20 years
i have known what happiness means 
i wish i could write more about this 
but it involves love 
and perfect love is the most beautiful
of all frustrations 
because it is more than one can express 
excuse me 
      excuse me  sir 
  yes  henry 
  i m sorry for the intrusion  sir 
  no  it s all right  come in  come in 
what is it  henry 
well  i m not quite sure  sir 
i just took a call from miss barry  sir 
she wanted me to tell you  sir 
that she s pregnant  sir 
i never    um    before i started   
where s mr  charles 
with harry 
oh  he may be on the stage by now 
mr  charles  he down there 
charlie  okay 
she ll drop the paternity suit 
i just talked to her lawyers  she ll settle 
  no 
  what 
well  just listen 
she ll take  150 000 
and that s nothing  not compared to a trial 
she says you did it at christmas
when she came to your house 
  morning  mary 
  good morning 
kid  i ve been making deals for you
all our lives 
i ve never made one this good 
it was over long before christmas 
it can t be my child 
just get it out of the way 
i can t do that 
i ve got oona to think of now 
syd  i ve got to prove my innocence 
look  i m all for proving your innocence  kid 
but how 
go back to them 
i beg you 
get them to agree to a blood test 
so that night
when you went to his house 
did you and mr  chaplin
have sexual relations 
doesn t it look like it 
never mind what it looks like 
did you have sexual relations
with mr  chaplin 
she just said she did  why else
would she agree to the blood tests 
the next morning he just called a cab 
paid me off 
he wanted somebody younger  classier 
didn t he 
hello 
yes 
yes 
yes  thank you 
it s all over 
the blood test prove it s not my baby 
right  let s just forget all this new fangled
rubbish about blood tests 
let s put it out of our minds 
his honor has ruled them inadmissible 
what is important now
is the financial future of this poor child 
it is her future the state of california
is here to protect 
it makes me mad
to watch the way this fellow
tries to put it over us simpletons 
this great star of stage and screen 
this alien 
who has enjoyed the hospitality
of our country for nearly 30 years
without ever once  ever once 
deigning to apply for american citizenship 
but what good
has all this money done chaplin 
wasting his substance in debauching girls 
what good has it done the country 
this is the kind of stuff
that makes for communism 
now my client  on the other hand 
is  alas 
no more moral than chaplin 
yes  yes  they re both equally guilty 
only  chaplin is old enough to be her father 
prowling around with girls that age 
members of the jury  use your god given
common sense  and just look at this man 
this cheap  cockney cad 
this
little tramp 
and then take a very good look
at innocent little carol ann 
i defy you not to see the resemblance 
gentlemen and ladies 
wives and mothers around the country
are watching you 
watching to see you stop chaplin
in his tracks 
you ll sleep well
the night you give this baby a name 
the night you show this lecher
that the law means him
as well as the bums on skid row 
it s a star studded evening here 
here is charlie chaplin
with his lovely wife  oona 
there goes mrs  chaplin 
looking gorgeous this evening
on the arm of her famous husband   
are you a communist  mr  chaplin 
  are you a fellow traveler 
  mr  chaplin   
are you going to attend
the mccarthy hearing 
  gentlemen  gentlemen  please 
  mr  chaplin   
mr  chaplin has repeatedly said
he ll go whenever they call him 
and even    even if there were only
one communist in the state department 
even if there were only one communist
in the state department 
that would still be one communist too many 
mr  lawson  are you
a member of the communist party
or have you ever been
a member of the communist party 
it s unfortunate and tragic
that i have to teach this committee
  the basic principles of americanism 
  that s not the question 
that s not the question 
the question is  have you ever been
a member of the communist party 
i m framing my answer in
the only way in which any american citizen
can frame his answer to a question
which absolutely invades his   
then you refuse to answer
that question  is that correct 
i have told you
that i will offer my beliefs   
  i have written americanism   
  stand away from the stand 
      for many years and i shall continue   
  stand away from the stand 
   to fight for the bill of rights
which you are seeking to destroy 
officer  take this man
away from the stand 
i d love to get away for a while  darling 
maybe after this bundle arrives
we could take the children and go 
sir 
sir 
we ve just got word 
chaplin s off to london on vacation 
kk 
  mummy  mummy 
where did you leave mr  chaplin 
  we left him back there at the stern 
  mummy 
it s all right  darling 
charlie 
charlie 
what  what is it  sweetheart 
is it syd 
no 
what is it 
they ve thrown you out 
thrown me out  thrown me out of what 
of america 
i m so sorry 
  i can t go back 
  no 
charlie 
there are nights
it s still hard being in exile 
i m sure they wouldn t
refuse you a visa now  charles 
have you never thought of going back 
  why don t we all go inside 
i have everything i need right here 
  but it s cold 
i like the cold 
  i have to go anyway 
telephone 
charlie  i heard the first three rings 
thank you 
no  george  in answer to your question 
i m used to invitations 
ah  yes 
well  it s been a long day  charlie 
yes  you must be very tired 
come on  george  finish it off 
the question mark 
what s it all about 
you mean that 
yes 
well  it was a personal matter  really 
nothing relevant 
tell me 
all right 
the madness 
i just wondered  how much did it affect you 
what makes you think it did 
  well  your mother was certified insane   
  yes 
   and your grandmother
was certified insane as well  and   
yes 
that s not what dogged me  george 
it wasn t that 
it was   
it was the knowledge that if you did
what i did for a living  if you were a clown 
and you had a passion
to tell a particular kind of story 
something
beyond 
but you only have the one chance
to get it right 
and i never did 
one never does  but you know that 
that s not the problem 
it s when you feel you re getting really close
but you can t make it the rest of the way 
you re not good enough 
you re not complete enough 
and despite all your fantasies 
you re second rate 
charlie 
human 
that s very hard 
why didn t you add that 
it s not important  really 
end of the day 
you re not judged by what you didn t do 
but by what you did 
and i didn t change things  i just   
he just
cheered people up 
not bad  that 
charlie 
charlie 
charlie  dear 
i dreamed i was answering questions
for george  silly 
charlie  that was california calling again 
you really do have to give them an answer 
no  they took 20 years
to make up their mind 
  i can take another afternoon 
  enough  enough 
what if they still hate me 
live from los angeles  the 44th
annual academy awards presentation 
suppose they start throwing things 
now that would be a story 
you never know on the stage 
hmm  i can see the headlines now 
 amazing incident at academy awards 
 chaplin disappears
under avalanche of oscars   
mr  walter matthau 
oh  look  darling  it s walter 
does that make you happy 
  no 
  crabby 
oh  i should never have let them
show those film clips  i never   
people won t like them 
they ll think they re old 
well  they are old 
well over 50 years  some of them 
you know the worst thing about age 
you can t defend yourself 
when i was young  handsome 
had my power 
if they came after me  i d make a movie
and make them laugh and i d make them cry 
now i m at their mercy 
  come in 
  go away 
we re ready for you  mr  chaplin 
this is a historic milestone
in the life of the academy 
behave yourself 
i would like to present the president
of the academy  mr  daniel taradash 
now remember  the president
of the academy  mr  daniel taradash 
  taradash 
  yes 
sounds like a spice 
the inscription reads 
 to charles chaplin 
 for the incalculable effect
he has had in making motion pictures
 the art form of this century 
 humor heightens our sense of survival
and preserves our sanity   
these are the words of charlie chaplin 
the abiding elements
of chaplin s artistic conscience
as actor  writer  director 
and to quote w c  fields 
 the greatest ballet dancer that ever lived   
a few years ago  mr  chaplin said 
 my only enemy is time   
we respectfully disagree 
i m going to leave you here  darling 
my white dress  remember 
they mustn t see anyone
till the clips are over 
   some unfathomable future
on some faraway star
