once upon a time 
there were two kingdoms that
were the worst of neighbors 
so vast was the discord between them
that it was said only a great hero
or a terrible villain might
bring them together 
in one kingdom lived
folk like you and me 
with a vain and greedy
king to rule over them 
they were forever discontent 
and envious of the wealth
and beauty of their neighbors 
for in the other kingdom  the moors 
lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature 
and they needed neither
king nor queen 
but trusted in one another 
in a great tree on a
great cliff in the moors
lived one such spirit 
you might take her for a girl 
but she was not just any girl 
she was a fairy 
there you go 
and her name
was maleficent 
good morning  mr  chanterelle 
i love your cap 
no  no  don t do it 
you missed me 
  good morning 
  good morning 
lovely work  girls 
what s all the fuss about 
the border guards have discov   
why do you get to tell her 
i want to tell her 
i want to 
there are rules  flittle  i tell
this time  you tell next time 
no  you told last time 
so i should tell this time 
and thistlewit next time 
tell me what 
fine 
thank you 
maleficent  the border guard   
the border guards have found a
human thief at the pool of jewels 
i m sorry 
she s always in a hurry 
with her big wings 
humans  here  i hope
there s not another war 
i m not afraid 
besides  i have never
seen a human up close 
come out 
no  they mean to kill me 
and besides  they re
hideous to look at 
that s extremely rude 
don t listen to him  balthazar 
you re classically handsome 
it s not right to steal 
but we don t kill people for it 
come out 
come out this instant 
are you fully grown 
no 
i believe he s just a boy 
and you re just a girl 
i think 
who are you 
i m called stefan 
who are you 
i m maleficent 
yes  right 
you have to give it back 
give what back 
if i knew you would throw it
away  i would have kept it 
i didn t throw it away 
i delivered it home 
as i m going to do for you 
someday  you know  i ll live there 
in the castle 
where do you live now 
in a barn 
so your parents are farmers  then 
my parents are dead 
mine  too 
we ll see each other again 
you really shouldn t come
back here  you know 
it s not safe 
and if i made that choice 
if i came back  would you be here 
perhaps 
  what s wrong 
  your ring 
iron burns fairies 
i m sorry 
i like your wings 
maleficent thought of how
stefan cast away his ring 
he who had so little in the world 
so that their hands
might touch again 
and her heart was moved 
thus did the young thief who
had hoped to steal a jewel   
maleficent 
steal something far more precious 
maleficent 
maleficent 
after all these weeks 
look who came back 
i thought it worth the risk 
so  what do you do for fun 
stefan and maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends 
and for a time it seemed
as if  in them at least 
the old hatred between men and
fairies had been forgotten 
as it will  friendship slowly
turned into something else 
and on her 16th birthday 
stefan gave maleficent a gift 
he told her it was true love s kiss 
but it was not to be 
as the years passed  stefan s ambition
pulled him away from maleficent 
and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom 
while maleficent 
the strongest of the fairies 
rose to become the
protector of the moors 
maleficent often wandered alone
and sometimes wondered
where stefan might be 
for she had never understood
the greed and envy of men 
but she was to learn 
for the human king had heard
of a growing power in the moors 
and he sought to strike it down 
guard  halt 
guard  halt 
there they are 
the mysterious moors where
no one dares to venture
for fear of the magical
creatures that lurk within 
well  i say crush them 
go no further 
a king
does not take orders
from a winged elf 
you are no king to me 
  bring me her head 
  battalion 
advance 
arise and stand with me 
hold the line 
  it s the dark creatures 
  it s the dark creatures 
charge 
you 
to the king 
you will not have the moors 
not now  nor ever 
you   
when i ascended to the throne 
i promised the people
one day we would take
the moors and its treasures 
each of you
swore allegiance to
me and to that cause 
your majesty 
defeated in battle 
is this to be my legacy 
i see you waiting for me to die 
it won t be long  but what then 
i will choose a successor
to take the throne and
care for my daughter 
who among you
is worthy 
kill the winged creature 
avenge me 
and upon my death you
will take the crown 
maleficent 
maleficent 
so  how is life with the humans 
maleficent  i ve come to warn you 
they mean to kill you 
king henry will stop at nothing 
please  you have to trust me 
they spoke of many things 
and the years faded away 
and she forgave stefan
his folly and his ambition 
and all was as it had been long ago 
you thirsty 
maleficent 
what is this 
i have avenged you  sire 
she is vanquished 
you have done well  my son 
you have done what
others feared to do 
you will be rewarded 
i shall do my best to
be a worthy successor 
your majesty 
i ve got you 
  you wicked bird 
  into a man 
it s a   
it s a demon 
what have you done
to my beautiful self 
would you rather i let
them beat you to death 
i m not certain 
stop complaining 
i saved your life 
forgive me 
what do i call you 
diaval 
and in return for saving my
life  i am your servant 
whatever you need 
wings 
i need you to be my wings 
i present to you the
first of his line 
his royal highness king stefan 
he did this to me so
he would be king 
now what  mistress 
her wings 
it s a girl 
it s a girl  it s a girl 
well 
well  i saw nothing 
but there s been a   
what 
child 
king stefan and the
queen have had a child 
there will be a christening 
they say it s to be a
grand celebration 
a grand celebration for a baby 
how wonderful 
all manner of folk came
to the christening 
even a trio of fairies who sought
to foster peace and goodwill 
look  there s the baby 
i love babies 
can you just concentrate  please 
i m not telling you again 
greetings  your majesty 
i am knotgrass of the
moorland fair folk 
i m flittle  your kingship 
and i m thistlewit 
your royalnesses 
they bring gifts for our daughter 
these are not just any old gifts 
for  you see  we re magic 
and very good with children 
very well 
sweet aurora  i wish for you
the gift of beauty 
my wish is that you
will never be blue 
only happy  all the
days of your life 
sweet baby 
my wish for you is that you find   
  maleficent 
  maleficent 
well  well 
what a glittering
assemblage  king stefan 
royalty  nobility 
the gentry  and   
how quaint 
even the rabble 
i must say
i really felt quite distressed
at not receiving an invitation 
you re not welcome here 
oh  dear 
what an awkward situation 
you re not offended 
why  no 
and to show i bear no ill will 
i  too  shall bestow
a gift on the child 
no  we don t want your gift 
stay away from the princess 
yes  stay away 
listen well  all of you 
listen well  all of you 
the princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty 
beloved by all who meet her 
that s a lovely gift 
don t do this 
but
before the sun sets
on her 16th birthday 
she will prick her finger on the
spindle of a spinning wheel
and fall into a sleep like death 
a sleep from which she
will never awaken 
maleficent  please don t
do this  i m begging you 
i like you begging 
do it again 
i beg you 
all right 
the princess can be woken
from her death sleep 
but only by
true love s kiss 
this curse will last
till the end of time 
no power on earth can change it 
king stefan ordered his men
to seize every spinning
wheel in the kingdom 
the wheels were broken and burned 
that they might never be used 
and thrown into the deepest
dungeon in the castle 
secretly  he entrusted
the safety of the child
to the magic of the pixies 
who would take her to a remote
hideaway for 16 years and a day 
stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle
while his soldiers rode far and
wide to hunt maleficent down 
but she made walls of her own 
that the moors might never
again suffer the touch
of any human 
and she reveled in the sorrow
that her curse had brought 
the fairies began their charge
to raise aurora in a snug
little cottage in the woods 
no  is this it 
looks dreadful 
come on 
we need a smaller   
baby 
or bigger bodies 
no  what we need is
a proper disguise 
what do you mean 
well  we have to blend in  don t we 
we have to be big enough
to look after this baby 
so  gather around  ladies 
get ready  one  two  three  grow 
that s worked quite well 
that s very nice 
now  there will be
no questions asked 
we are no longer fairies 
we are three peasant women raising
our orphan child in the woods 
  yes 
  so  no more flying 
  no flying 
  no  no  and no magic 
  no magic 
  yes  you heard 
it s in the middle of nowhere 
at least no one will find us here 
there you are  why are
you always hiding 
come on  there you go 
it s so ugly  you could
almost feel sorry for it 
i hate you  beasty 
the fairies were perhaps
unequal to their task 
why is she crying 
i think she might be hungry 
then feed her 
there you are 
there you go 
it s going to starve with
those three looking after it 
it tickles 
  what 
  you re cheating 
i saw that 
  we re starting again 
  suit yourself 
greedy  bloated goat 
 bloated goat  
stop doing that 
i m not doing anything 
well  someone is 
it s not me 
you two are having a go at me 
and i will not tolerate   
stop it 
why   
no 
this is all your fault 
come on  that s funny 
as the days went on 
stefan darkened 
further consumed by
paranoia and vengeance 
  burn it all down 
  yes  sir 
flame 
release 
run 
you failed me 
the wall cannot be burned 
it is indestructible 
nothing is indestructible 
not the wall  not maleficent 
not even her curse 
bring me the iron workers 
you 
look 
the little beast is about
to fall off the cliff 
what 
hello 
go away 
go 
go away 
i don t like children 
up  up 
go along  go  go  go 
as maleficent had said 
aurora did grow in grace and beauty 
pretty bird 
far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not 
and as the seasons changed
and the flowers grew 
so did she 
hello 
that s it 
there you go 
she wondered at the world about her 
and at what lay beyond the
fearsome wall of thorns 
curious little beasty 
but she was not the only one
who wished to get through 
look 
  is that her  is that maleficent 
  i don t know 
bring them to me 
no  it s just a silly peasant girl 
steady 
  it s her 
  it s her 
how could you do that to me 
you said anything i need 
yeah  but not a dog 
it was a wolf  not a dog 
it s the same thing 
they re dirty  vicious 
and they hunt birds 
fine  next time i ll turn
you into a mealy worm 
well  i ll be a mealy worm  gladly 
anything but a filthy  stinking   
i wonder 
i know you re there 
don t be afraid 
i am not afraid 
then come out 
then you ll be afraid 
no  i won t 
i know who you are 
do you 
you re my fairy godmother 
what 
fairy godmother 
you ve been watching
over me my whole life 
i ve always known you were close by 
how 
your shadow  it s been following
me ever since i was small 
wherever i went  your
shadow was always with me 
i remember you 
pretty bird 
this is diaval 
hello  aurora 
i have known you since
you were a little one 
it s everything i
imagined it would be 
it s just so beautiful 
i ve always wanted to come   
good night  beasty 
you mock me 
i know what you re doing 
i know exactly what you re doing 
sire 
your presence has been
requested by the queen 
leave me 
sire  she is not well 
the nurses are fearful that she
won t make it through the night 
can you not see we re
having a conversation 
when the curse fails 
maleficent will come for me 
and on that day  i will be ready 
they re so beautiful 
i revoke the curse 
let it be no more 
i revoke the curse 
let it be no more 
i revoke my curse 
let it be no more 
i revoke my curse 
let it be no more 
let it be no more 
this curse will last
till the end of time 
no power on earth can change it 
do all the fair people have wings 
most do 
then why don t you 
all the other fairies fly 
i had wings once 
they were stolen from me 
that s all i wish to say about it 
what color were they 
were they big 
so big they dragged
behind me when i walked 
and they were strong 
they could carry me above the
clouds and into the headwinds 
and they never faltered 
not even once 
i could trust them 
she s coming  she s coming 
where are your workers 
in their beds  majesty 
get them back to work without delay 
they re exhausted  sire 
but i ll have them back
to work at first light 
i need them back to work now 
it s the wee hours 
aye 
aye 
it is the wee hours 
so wake them up 
sire

them back to work now 
we re running out of time  go  now

and i cannot keep you from it

then we can look after each other 
you don t have to wait
until you re older 
you could live here now 
then i will

eat berries and black nuts
and all the fair people

i ll be happy here for
the rest of my life 
i m going to tell my
aunties tomorrow

i m so excited 
aunties  i m almost 16

it s her fate  anyway 
go ahead

a bird  a worm 
i don t care anymore 
i m so happy we re leaving tomorrow 
we are not leaving tomorrow 
tomorrow is aurora s 16th birthday 
and stefan told us to take her

with these two imbeciles   
so that you could ruin
it on the last day 
we are taking you back
to your father with   
my father 
you told me my parents were dead 
i think you better
come and sit down 
fairy godmother 
i m here 
when were you going to
tell me that i m cursed 
is it true

my aunts said it was an evil fairy 
i    i can t remember her name 
they said

maleficent 
is that you 
are you maleficent

gate  i want her to walk right in 
sorry to disturb  your majesty 
we found this urchin at the gate 
she claims to be the princess 
father

they brought you
back a day too soon 
i told those three idiots 
lock her up in her room 
go 
prepare the men 
maleficent s coming 
it s so good to be small again 
look at my feet 
i love my tiny little feet 
pay attention 
we have to find aurora 
or the king will have our heads 
aurora 
wait 
princess 
i m looking for a girl 
of course you are 
i need a horse 
into a sleep like death 
aurora 
come on  diaval 
aurora 
faster  diaval  faster 
she will prick her finger on the
spindle of a spinning wheel
and fall into a sleep like death 
no power on earth   
a sleep like death 
it s done 
they pulled the guards 
he s waiting for you in there 
if we go inside those walls 
we ll never come out alive 
then don t come 
it s not your fight 
thank you very much 
 i need you  diaval  i can t

she s only sleeping 
she s only sleeping  you say 
she s only sleeping 
she s only sleeping forever 
  what about the kiss 
  yes  true love s kiss 
true love does not exist 
but it s her only
chance  your majesty 
mistress 
what are we going to do 
we can t give up  can we 
come on  girls 
but we don t even
know where to start 
true love doesn t just
fall from trees  you know 
pardon me 
i m embarrassed to say i
don t know where i am 
in king stefan s castle 
this is where i m meant to be 
odd that i can t
recall how i got here 
why have you come 
my father sent me to see the king 
who is your father 
king john of ulstead 
a prince 
aurora 
he knows her 
why is she sleeping 
she s trapped in an enchantment 
isn t she beautiful 
the most beautiful
girl i ve ever seen 
do you want to kiss her 
very much 
go on  then 
i wouldn t feel right about it 
i barely know her 
we ve only met once 
haven t you ever heard
of love at first sight 
kiss her 
go on 
an enchantment  you say 
kiss her 
you didn t do it properly 
it s supposed to be
true love s kiss 
i was certain he was the one 
  what are you doing 
  we have to keep looking 
i told you 
i will not ask your forgiveness
because what i have done
to you is unforgivable 
i was so lost
in hatred and revenge 
sweet aurora 
you stole what was left of my heart 
and now i have lost you forever 
i swear  no harm will come
to you as long as i live 
and not a day shall pass
that i don t miss your smile 
hello  godmother 
hello  beasty 
no truer love 
she s here  sire 
are we going back to the moors now 
if that is what you wish 
we ve got her 
  stop 
  get back 
no 
into a dragon 
to the other side 
run  aurora 
get back  hold it steady 
pull to the left  pull 
hold the line 
look out  hold your line 
  close in 
  bring it down 
enough 
how does it feel 
to be a fairy creature without wings
in a world where you don t belong 
kill her 
kill her 
shoot 
shoot her 
take aim 
it s over 
maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns
and took off her crown 
and she invited aurora to see
how the moors had been once 
long ago  when maleficent
was but a child
and her heart was bright 
for now  it was again 
but that was not all 
there she is  hurry up 
they re waiting 
wait for me 
we present this crown
to our little aurora 
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our   
never mind 
our kingdoms have been unified 
you have your queen 
so you see  the story is
not quite as you were told 
and i should know 
for i was the one they
called sleeping beauty 
in the end  my kingdom was
