i see  horrible john 
naughty john  poor julia 
no  no  no walking away  i know
you re good at it  but not tonight 
where is he 
  new zealand  maybe  i don t know 
  not round the corner  like you 
he was in the merchant navy 
no letters  no money  he abandoned us 
then you abandoned me 
it was a temporary thing  mimi agreed 
temporary  i m still living with her 
  i always wanted you back 
  i believe you  honest 
she never gave you back 
but surely i m not mimi s to give 
you re my mum 
she    she loves you so much 
yeah  more than you 
mummy  i m tired now 
  are you sad again 
  mummy s not sad  look 
i m coming in now  honey 
go on 
i do love you  believe me 
believe me  i would love to 
  john  where are you going 
  away from you 
mimi 
you said you d be back 
i think i ll just   
i ve got some work to finish 
it was meant to be a surprise 
a hoffner 
mimi 
you stink of alcohol 
mum threw a party for me 
that s a waste  isn t it 
tell your friends the party s over 
no  thanks 
  we ve got a gatecrasher 
  i need to talk to john 
more talking  wow 
you see  me and mum
have had a bit of a heart to heart 
yes  she told me things about   
what s his name     alf 
and about you  funnily enough 
yeah  she said you stole me 
  what do you reckon  mimi 
  i never said that 
you said  quote   she   as in you 
mimi   never gave you back   
when i don t give things back 
i ve got to admit  i m usually stealing 
what on earth have you
been telling him  julia 
did she say why i stole you 
well  there she is  ask her yourself 
did she mention having another man s
child to deal with  a daughter 
mimi  please 
please what  stop  look at him 
do you think we can stop now 
whose child 
go on  tell him  as you re
so keen for him to know the truth 
what daughter 
your mother has always needed company 
do you understand what i mean 
rock n roll  eh  mum 
and she found it  with a young soldier
whilst your father was away at sea 
you have another sister  victoria 
where is she  where 
we don t know  salvation army took her 
then  after that 
your mother decides to shack up
with another fancy man  bobby 
still married to your father 
i might add 
and then bring you up as if that was
acceptable  as if that was normal 
when your father came home
after the war 
he wanted to try and save the marriage 
but she d have none of it 
she told him to get lost 
but alf wasn t giving up that easily 
was he  julia 
feel free
to join the conversation 
no  i didn t think she would 
you were staying here with me
at mendips
when alf turned up out of the blue 
he said he wanted to take you
into liverpool 
i thought he was genuine but he took you
to blackpool instead  he kidnapped you 
turned out he d organised
a passage to new zealand 
got himself a job out there 
wanted to take you with him 
we hadn t a clue where you were 
i was distraught 
the seaman s mission had an address
for a relative in blackpool
so we went to find you 
to bring you back 
alf wouldn t let me in  said
it was between him and your mother 
he pleaded with her
to give the marriage another chance 
to keep the family together 
but  again  it was of no use 
but what to do with you 
so  in all their great wisdom   
who do you want to be with 
me or your mum 
   they decided to ask you 
a five year old boy 
who you wanted to spend
the rest of your life with 
and you said   
my daddy 
daddy 
so knowing that alf was planning
to take you to new zealand
and knowing she
would probably never see you again 
your mother walked out 
mum  please  stop 
and that is when i stole you 
and if that s stealing  i m a thief 
i had no choice 
you had a choice 
you chose to take my son 
john 
i was never going to leave you 
you walked out the fucking house 
down the street 
yes  yes  i did  but i was ill 
  i get ill 
  you left because you were ill 
i don t think straight  i don t sleep 
i ve seen doctors
but they don t understand 
i don t understand 
but i am here now 
i am here  i never meant to leave you 
please  john  please  i love you  john 
i love you  i m sorry  i m sorry 
  no    no 
  please  john 
i said no 
can t you see what you re doing to me 
i m going out of my brain
and that s not fair 
is it 
this is your fault and yours 
so  why should i go mad 
fuck it  it s over 
go home  julia 
hey  you idiot 
no chance  get to fuck 
forgive me  angel 
come on  marie  he s a loser 
did you love him 
  you frightened me to death 
  right place for it 
did you 
well  that s a horrible thing to say 
  you never showed it 
  you just didn t see it 
with my eyesight  possibly 
i m not going to hold it against her 
what she did in blackpool 
  forgive and forget  i suppose 
  forget 
i wish 
there s just no point
hating someone you love 
i mean  really love  is there  mimi 
  i should move out 
  what 
the house seems a bit crowded
all of a sudden 
who knows  with me gone 
maybe you and mum might remember
you were sisters once
