naughty john poor julia
no no no walking away i know
youre good at it but not tonight
where is he
new zealand maybe i dont know
not round the corner like you
he was in the merchant navy
no letters no money he abandoned us
then you abandoned me
it was a temporary thing mimi agreed
temporary im still living with her
i always wanted you back
i believe you honest
she never gave you back
but surely im not mimis to give
youre my mum
she she loves you so much
yeah more than you
mummy im tired now
are you sad again
mummys not sad look
im coming in now honey
go on
i do love you believe me
believe me i would love to
john where are you going
away from you
mimi
you said youd be back
i think ill just
ive got some work to finish
it was meant to be a surprise
a hoffner
mimi
you stink of alcohol
mum threw a party for me
thats a waste isnt it
tell your friends the partys over
no thanks
weve got a gatecrasher
i need to talk to john
more talking wow
you see me and mum
have had a bit of a hearttoheart
yes she told me things about
whats his name alf
and about you funnily enough
yeah she said you stole me
what do you reckon mimi
i never said that
you said quote she as in you
mimi never gave you back
when i dont give things back
ive got to admit im usually stealing
what on earth have you
been telling him julia
did she say why i stole you
well there she is ask her yourself
did she mention having another mans
child to deal with a daughter
mimi please
please what stop look at him
do you think we can stop now
whose child
go on tell him as youre
so keen for him to know the truth
what daughter
your mother has always needed company
do you understand what i mean
rocknroll eh mum
and she found it with a young soldier
whilst your father was away at sea
you have another sister victoria
where is she where
we dont know salvation army took her
then after that
your mother decides to shack up
with another fancy man bobby
still married to your father
i might add
and then bring you up as if that was
acceptable as if that was normal
when your father came home
after the war
he wanted to try and save the marriage
but shed have none of it
she told him to get lost
but alf wasnt giving up that easily
was he julia
feel free
to join the conversation
no i didnt think she would
you were staying here with me
at mendips
when alf turned up out of the blue
he said he wanted to take you
into liverpool
i thought he was genuine but he took you
to blackpool instead he kidnapped you
turned out hed organised
a passage to new zealand
got himself a job out there
wanted to take you with him
we hadnt a clue where you were
i was distraught
the seamans mission had an address
for a relative in blackpool
so we went to find you
to bring you back
alf wouldnt let me in said
it was between him and your mother
he pleaded with her
to give the marriage another chance
to keep the family together
but again it was of no use
but what to do with you
so in all their great wisdom
who do you want to be with
me or your mum
they decided to ask you
a fiveyearold boy
who you wanted to spend
the rest of your life with
and you said
my daddy
daddy
so knowing that alf was planning
to take you to new zealand
and knowing she
would probably never see you again
your mother walked out
mum please stop
and that is when i stole you
and if thats stealing im a thief
i had no choice
you had a choice
you chose to take my son
john
i was never going to leave you
you walked out the fucking house
down the street
yes yes i did but i was ill
i get ill
you left because you were ill
i dont think straight i dont sleep
ive seen doctors
but they dont understand
i dont understand
but i am here now
i am here i never meant to leave you
please john please i love you john
i love you im sorry im sorry
no no
please john
i said no
cant you see what youre doing to me
im going out of my brain
and thats not fair

forgive me angel
come on marie hes a loser
did you love him
you frightened me to death
right place for it

you never showed it
you just didnt see it
with my eyesight possibly
im not going to hold it against her
what she did in blackpool
forgive and forget i suppose

i wish
theres just no point
hating someone you love
i mean really love is there mimi
i should move out
