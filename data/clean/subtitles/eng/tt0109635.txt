hi  cindy  what s up 
garvin came by the office this morning 
about the promotion 
matt  will you stop that 
he was surprised i was late 
what does that mean 
did he say it in passing 
or like he really meant it 
i wonder why garvin came by the office
at eight in the morning 
to congratulate you 
he treats everyone like dirt  
except the top guys 
except the top guys 
when this merger with conley white
goes through   
   and they spin off our division   
   we re going to be rich 
we re already rich 
no  i mean   
   really rich 
my grandmother used to say 
 don t climb up there too close to god 
he might shake the tree  
tom 
thanks for this morning 
smaller  faster  cheaper  better 
remember lugging the first ones around 
people were amazed  it was like
showing a polaroid to a bushman 
now  if it s bigger than a credit card 
it s too inconvenient 
keeps you on your toes 
eddie  it s tom  cindy said you called 
sure  i can hold 
how s the job search 
28 years at ibm  did i
tell you what they told me 
i was  surplussed  
ever hear that word 
what s going on down there 
what  that s crazy 
they should ve said   sodomized  
they re not going to sell the
austin plant  that s just a rumor 
you don t see it coming  you go along 
and then one day there s no room 
no more room for you 
smaller  faster  cheaper  better 
i won t mention names  i m just telling
you  it s not true  it s a rumor 
i was making 150 a year  big money 
it s probably what you make  huh 
hang on 
why don t you call cindy   
   make an appointment 
i ll see if i can help 
eddie  they are not
going to sell austin 
if i m telling you 
who else are you going to believe 
cindy 
pretty name 
used to have fun with the girls 
nowadays they want your job 
good morning 
 what did garvin say  should i see him 
 he didn t say 
he growled 
he was flirting  did you get arthur 
he s standing by on the dvl 
lunch with conley white is at noon 
we ll probably have those sandwiches
with the crusts cut off 
their jaws were wired shut
at the same prep school 
the merger s still happening 
you heard something 
no 
just  i    
what s on your tie 
garvin didn t mention my promotion 
you said you d be early today 
people from  father of the year 
didn t call 
no 
that s a joke 
five seconds to malaysia 
should i close the door 
do i ever ask that 
never 
malaysian video linkup 
you look good  awake 
what s wrong with arcamax 
the drives are very slow  we re
getting seek times in the 140 160 range 
140 isn t a sexy cd player anymore 
everyone has 140 
my guys think there s
a compatibility problem   
   between the controller chip
and the driver s software 
that ll put us back a year 
the screen flickers  the current cuts
in and out  it s a design problem 
what do you mean 
all laptops have the same design 
i sent you out some drives 
you should get them today 
this is bad  arthur 
how could this happen 
going to bury it until the merger 
don t you say anything 
does anyone else know 
i m a grave  what  are you kidding  tom 
i still think  really 
that arcamax will be a major  major hit 
i ll call you when i see the drives 
did you get the macadamia nuts 
good night  arthur 
they are so good 
he s off the phone  i got to go 
do you know a meredith johnson 
 yes  years ago 
 she wanted to see you 
she s here for the lunch 
the entire company came for this lunch 
garvin brought up the operations group 
meredith is in operations 
what should i tell her 
bad day  in laws in town 
i m going to see lewyn about the 900s 
stop worrying 
if there was bad news
garvin would ve sent phil blackburn 
phil 
are you coming to see me 
no  why 
nothing  how are you 
how are you  tom 
you look all beat up 
i do 
you re letting it get to you 
don t take it personally 
take what personally 
maybe it s just a rumor 
what s a rumor 
i don t want to spread rumors 
that s how these things get started 
you mean austin 
who said that 
what am i missing 
i can t believe he didn t tell you 
he s so perverse 
tell me what 
so  how s susan 
susan s good 
 how s lonnie 
 great 
 did you know she got tenure 
 that s great 
here s my stop 
i tried to explain to garvin 
you know him  he s like a child 
fuck your feelings if they interfere
with his surprise 
 what surprise 
 rumor is you re getting passed over 
so i m not getting the vp job 
that s the rumor 
rumors are always true 
garvin didn t say anything 
came by the office  i was late 
susan had a conference 
 you were late  today 
 why re you in seattle 
good to see you again 
somebody tells garvin i was talking
to you  you know how he is about leaks 
leak  i thought it was a rumor 
it was different before 
i could watch your back 
who gets the job  stephanie kaplan 
rumor is he went outside the group 
you d still head up manufacturing   
   presumably 
wait a minute 
i might be out of a job 
don t get paranoid 
i m a quick learner 
you wouldn t make someone vp
and not let them appoint their own team 
how would that look 
am i out of a job 
come on  tom 
i m already out on a limb 
are you okay  you want a prozac 
no  i m fine 
i m disappointed  but i m fine 
you sure 
don t worry about me 
i m a stockholder  whatever s   
   best for the company    
leave a message for susan  tom 
matt and eliza  after the beep 
thanks for calling  bye 
 obviously  he s disappointed 
 but he took it well 
overall  i d say yes 
no bumps before the merger 
i don t want him quitting 
it s up to you 
just one big happy family 
you got that 
i have to say  going down to see him
this morning was a masterstroke 
it really put him on the defensive 
i ll keep an eye on him 
he ll get on the program 
when push comes to shove 
he has no guts 
let me ask you something 
you know susan 
if i heard a rumor about the   
   future of the company   
   my future   
   you know  nothing crazy 
a real rumor   
   what would susan say 
you think she d say to see garvin 
here s someone you should meet 
tom sanders 
he heads up manufacturing 
steven chase  crescent capital 
john conley 
you re john conley 
junior  dad s coming on friday
with members of the board 
 catch you at the lunch 
 tom  come in 
you wanted to see me 
yeah  sorry about this morning 
you know how kids are 
have you met meredith johnson 
what s wrong 
that s a hello you d give to a rash 
i m preoccupied  it s not you 
we go way back  he broke my heart 
she s making that up 
i thought your heart was made of plastic 
he said i could be anything i wanted 
 he was right 
 it was a line 
 it wasn t a line 
 i didn t know you were acquainted 
wilde said   i like a man with a future
and a woman with a past  
i heard you were in operations 
i don t know  am i 
the last few years i ve been cleaning
up the mess bob made of this company 
if it s such a mess  why am i so rich 
yes  but you re a lot richer now 
we should catch up  get together 
i d love that 
plenty of time now 
flying over wyoming 
i thought the merger was dead 
conley was choking on the valuation 
the spin off was meredith s idea 
conley thinks it was their idea 
 really 
 lit them up like a christmas tree 
she saved the merger 
you have money now 
you can even buy a new tie 
so  what was it
you wanted to see me about 
meredith fucking johnson 
son of a bitch  goddamn garvin 
 what happened 
 i didn t get it 
 you re not the new vp 
 he announced it 
it was a secret 
he s got her installed in the office   
   bouncing quips back and forth 
who 
 who s she 
 will this affect the spin off 
she doesn t know the difference
between software and a sweater 
what aren t you telling us 
i might be out of a job 
you know what it s like out there 
what about the spin off 
they didn t tell me about me 
would they tell me about the spin off  
i m sorry 
this is the worst day of my life 
all right 
who is she 
let me guess  attractive 
what does that matter 
nipples like pencil erasers 
she s attractive  very attractive 
sleeping with garvin 
that s why he got a nordic track 
it s a curse to be me 
life holds no surprises 
this is such a clich  
how do you think a clich 
becomes a clich  
you mean like   size doesn t matter  
i have a thing for you 
all right  please 
can we get some work done 
we got a small problem with arcamax 
 it s not the design 
 it s not the code 
any woman must be twice as good
as a man and work harder for less pay 
clich  grande 
how does a clich  become one 
it is very weird 
we know nothing about this woman 
i do 
i had a thing with her 
you are amazing 
it was years ago 
you ve seen more ass than a rental car 
get a few more women in your life
so you can be a census 
maybe you can sleep your way up 
right 
wait  why  why her and not tom 
he s not attractive 
men and women are different 
not in a way that matters to you 
are you saying i m a virgin 
meanwhile  you were asking me
about the spin off 
garvin said it was her idea 
it s always such a pleasure to come here   
   and be with the
advanced products group 
i feel such a warmth for the people here 
i feel a kinship 
and i ve always wanted to give you   
is this seat taken 
   the most advanced original
leadership that i could 
how are you 
 sorry you didn t get the promotion 
 i m sorry you didn t get it either 
how long have you known 
really  that long 
every time i ve wanted to promote
a woman   
   to break the glass ceiling   
   it s always the same story 
 but  bob     but  bob     
i ve thought about it often since
my daughter s death  that had she lived   
   it would be extremely rare   
   that she ever got to run a company 
so it has a special meaning
for me when i tell you   
   that when we announce the merger   
   we will also announce the new vp
for advanced operations and planning   
   in seattle   
   will be meredith johnson 
unbelievable 
thanks  bob  can i have the lights 
the advanced products group has been
the heart of digicom for the last 10 years 
advanced products has historically
consisted of four divisions    
you seem to be spending
more time up here 
my son s a freshman at the university 
this way i get to see more of him 
i thought it had to do with the merger 
this merger means everything to garvin 
give a man a  100 million
and you create a frustrated billionaire 
the new compression algorithms
will shift industry standards   
   to full res digitized video
at 60 fields a second   
   with platform independent
risc processors supported by   
   a 32 bit color active   
conley s a conservative company 
is meredith conservative 
i don t know 
i thought you knew her 
is there anything you don t know 
we offer  through technology   
   what religion and revolution
have promised but never delivered 
freedom from the physical body 
freedom from race and gender   
   from nationality and personality 
from place and time 
communicating by cellular phone
and hand held computer   
   pda and built in fax modem   
   we can relate to each
other as pure consciousness 
smart  touching base
with all the division heads 
she didn t name them in her speech 
does it mean something 
only if she plans to make changes 
phil said she wasn t planning
on making any changes 
you know meredith 
wait a minute 
i must know  am i out of a job 
what was she bending your ear about 
stephanie  nothing  just small talk 
what  all of a sudden
there s stephanie lite 
she was talking about her son
at the university 
sorry i didn t get to mention you 
that s fine 
i m jammed all day but why
don t you come up at seven 
we ll have a drink
and catch up on business 
great 
i remember how you liked
a good bottle of wine  i ll get one 
what s she want to see you
at seven about 
probably the arcamax problems  we must
discuss it before conley asks questions 
she doesn t give you a boner 
because  you know 
i definitely have lift off 
what about you  you got a woody 
she s very nice 
 i ll let you know what happens 
 don t do that 
you have a sexual urge every 20 minutes 
it s a physical certainty 
it s hard wired into your brain 
you can t fight it 
why would you want to  live a little 
ten years from now you ll need a forklift
to get a hard on 
i ll call you 
i ll count the minutes 
where ve you been all day 
i didn t get it 
no  they went outside the division 
someone from operations 
what can i say  i got passed over 
what can i say 
so  did you get the tickets for disneyland 
no  i know 
but i promised the guy and it s   
mohammed jafar 
thanks a lot  probably won t be home
for dinner tonight 
i love you too  bye 
are there any asset sale triggers 
in the indenture 
will you do me a favor 
alan  brown will go 250 on this  easy 
let s just do this thing 
not a bad idea for a girl 
let s talk first thing 
 91  pahlmeyer 
i ve looked all over for it 
i like all the boys under me to be happy 
congratulations 
thank you 
i brought the files up for arcamax
if you want to see them 
show me your pictures 
the diagrams 
your family  you have pictures 
yeah  sure 
here s     here 
that s matthew 
that s eliza at halloween 
and here s susan with the kids 
she looks like she always has food
in the refrigerator 
 she never lost the baby weight  
 she doesn t look like a refrigerator 
i mean  she s made a home for you 
in my fridge i ve got some champagne
and an orange 
doesn t eliza look pretty 
she looks like susan 
it can be inhibiting 
 what s that 
 domesticity 
you d be surprised 
you can t jump her from behind   
   because you get excited by
the way she bends to pick up the soap 
remember that 
i remember that 
and you miss it 
there s compensations 
of course  life s a series of trade offs 
i wouldn t trade what i have 
i wouldn t want you to 
that s exactly why i can trust you 
you have more to lose than i do 
i ll bring you up to speed
on the problems with the drives 
you kept in good shape  tom 
nice and hard 
thank you 
it s different now 
you re my boss 
it s different 
okay 
rub my shoulders and i ll listen
to your problems 
the specs and the seek times
call for 100 milliseconds 
we have that on the prototypes 
but the drives coming off line  
 are the drives here 
 it might be a chip 
 answer my question 
 i m trying to 
understand the controller chip
positions the split optics 
i ll show you the schematic 
no  no  no  no  rub 
you can t understand the problem  
 do you have the drives 
 arthur sent five  
 i said no calls 
 it s mr  garvin 
but after that  nobody 
is it all right if i leave for the day 
that s fine  mrs  ross 
you d rather talk about other things   
   than answer my question
because you don t know 
you don t know what the problem is 
but you can t say   i don t know    
   because in your mind that means
you lose  you re worthless  men 
 what will you tell conley 
 i can t lie to them 
talk about the prototypes  they work 
focus on the positive 
we re on line  it s not
about the prototypes 
 they want to know if you can build it 
 i understand that  
do you have a problem working for me 
no 
hi  bob 
you don t want to hear
about my hard day 
yes  that s hard work 
let me get my docs together 
the merger is about people  not arcamax 
they re comfortable with me and bob 
this isn t about some cd rom
that ll be obsolete in a year 
if they ask 
then you tell them you don t know 
hi  bob  i m here 
i ve got a great idea about that 
go ahead 
lewyn  this is sanders 
i ve discussed the drives with meredith 
she says don t tell the conley people   
   until we know exactly
what the problems are 
that is the line for the eight a m 
meeting tomorrow  
let s get down to business 
wait a sec  wait a sec 
meredith  wait a second 
 there  was that so bad 
 that s not so bad  it s just  
come on  while there s still
a chance we might get caught 
no  no 
oh  yes  i think so 
some things never change 
and some things just get better 
meredith  come on 
 remember all the things we did 
 i remember 
things nobody knows about you but me 
all our secrets 
just lie back and let me take you 
i could have anybody and i picked you 
now you ve got all the power 
you ve got something i want 
doesn t that make you feel good 
don t stop me  come on 
don t worry  i m not going to bite 
let me do whatever i want 
you just lie back and let me be the boss 
wait a second  wait a second 
wait a minute 
what 
look  nobody has to know 
nobody gets hurt 
it s just a meeting
between two colleagues 
just another dull day
in the computer business 
no  honey 
don t 
here

 no  goddamn 
you stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality 
this never happened 
you never used to be this way 
i have a family now 
a family made you stupid 
you take those two champagne bottles
in your refrigerator   
   and fuck them 
you son of a bitch 
you get back here
and finish what you started 
you hear me 
do you 
come back and finish what you started
or you are dead 
you are fucking dead 
shit  it s dead 
you are hereby notified
that we will hold your client liable  
i didn t hear you come in 
i m going to take a shower 
 no kiss 
 i just feel kind of shitty  you know 
screw them 
 they don t deserve you 
 can you get me a beer 
thanks  before i forget 
could you do me a favor 
the cellular s battery s dead 
sure  i thought they
were supposed to last all day 
i thought so 
who s meredith johnson 
what 
meredith johnson 
she called just before you got home 
she called 
yeah  about ten minutes ago 
she said the 8 a m  had been pushed
back to 8 30 
 who is she 
 she s the one  the new vp 
she s the one 
she came from the valley 
how old is she 
i don t know  33  maybe 
that s young for that job 
 had you ever heard of her 
 she s a face guy 
she made the merger happen 
now she s garvin s fair haired   whatever 
where d she come from 
has she any technical background 
no  that s the thing with the merger 
everything s changed 
that s not the worst thing in the world 
she ll crash and burn 
then they ll appreciate you 
things aren t easy out there 
so quit   
   rather than let them treat you badly 
we might lose everything 
including the stock options 
i don t care about stock options 
i ll work full time 
i m capable of supporting our family 
just trying to help 
you re too nice sometimes 
i don t need you to fight
my battles for me  thanks 
right now some lucky girl
in the building will come after me 
i deserve that  but ask yourself   
   why does a man go with another girl 
he s unhappy at home 
because he s lonely 
but that was before you  fran 
i ve stopped running 
why are you wearing a t shirt 
you never do 
i don t know  just a little cold 
what are you going to do 
grin and bear it  like i usually do 
and hope it doesn t get worse 
morning 
morning  bob 
that s a nice suit 
nice fabric 
can i feel it 
what is that  wool 
with a little bit of viscose 
that s what makes the pants
drape so well 
you work out 
when i get a chance  bob 
it s been busy lately 
i ve always liked you 
now you have the power 
you have something i want 
come on 
the computer takes the information
from the database   
   and constructs an environment
that is projected in the headset 
when the user walks on the pad 
he or she   
   feels like they re walking in a hall
with drawers of files on all sides 
the user can stop  open any file   
   and look at the data  the laser
scanners are for body representation 
 that s amazing 
 it s cool  isn t it 
where is everyone 
they left 15 minutes ago 
don cherry s demo ing the corridor 
the meeting s at 8 30 
no  7 30  it got pushed up 
nobody told you 
if someone wants to log on with
a regular computer  what they ll see   
   is a model of themselves with a photo
that s pulled up from a data file 
hey  i know you 
the photo bears some
resemblance to me  i admit 
an inside joke here at the company 
we ve also constructed virtual help 
users always need on line help 
we created an angel to help you 
welcome to the corridor 
the same face 
angel   
   how do i open this drawer 
what s the angel saying 
that s between them 
we don t see the corridor
as a product in the marketplace now 
this is something that we worked
up to demonstrate the potential   
   of virtual reality technology 
this looks good 
hold on  what s that 
i believe it s your financial records 
turn that damn thing off 
sorry 
in the final system there will be
safeguards that will control access 
so glad you could join us 
that was a sweet entrance  my friend 
did the ferry hit an iceberg  you were
going to call me after meeting meredith 
i called you from her office 
left a message 
there was nothing on my machine 
then you re late again 
thank god meredith
led the discussion 
hey  pal  i left a message
on your machine  all right 
check it out 
did you get my message 
you told susan the meeting
had been moved to 8 30 
i said 7 30  if your wife can t take
a fucking message  get a machine 
 there you go  mr  sanders 
 thank you 
you re welcome 
full house today 
meredith has been getting us
up to speed on the arcamax 
we d like your read on it 
meredith said there are problems 
you might have to go back
to the drawing board 
i m sorry if i conveyed that
impression to meredith 
i m convinced we can manufacture them 
how many of the drives meet specs 
i don t have that information with me 
meredith told us the line is running
at 29     is that approximately right 
the seek times are off specs 
there s a power flicker in the screen 
 right 
 that s right 
with the merger impending 
shouldn t you have told someone 
the merger isn t about a cd rom
that might be obsolete in a year 
it s about people 
 it ll be obsolete in a year 
 the promise of the arcamax   
   was a central factor in this merger 
i may be at fault  tom said the
problem with the drives was serious 
not so serious 
don t cover up 
 i m not covering anything up 
 give us worst case 
we go back to the drawing boards
and we re down for nine months 
nine months 
meredith said six weeks 
nobody likes to go back to the board 
but it can be an advantage 
is there a problem 
this isn t an inquisition 
i feel like i m pulling teeth 
john just wants to get a handle on
what the problems are with the lines 
 i don t know is the honest answer 
 wait a minute 
you are head of manufacturing 
you are in charge of arcamax 
there are problems with it   
   that could take nine months to fix 
which i assume means a year 
and the bottom line is   
   you don t know 
goddamn it 
goddamn it 
jesus christ 
i wanted to see you 
it s not going to work out with meredith 
 evidently not 
 she set me up 
i saw 
 she set me up 
 sit down 
 why  what d i do 
 please  would you just sit 
meredith told me
about your meeting last night 
what 
what d she say 
she wants to handle the intervention
internally  which is best 
 she still cares about you 
 wait a minute 
what d she say 
not to put too fine a point on it 
she said you sexually harassed her 
i sexually harassed her 
 what would you call it 
 she jumped me 
she jumped you  you re in denial 
that s typical 
she almost raped me 
you need help 
you must accept responsibility for  
what about this 
what about that 
looks like she defended herself 
defended herself  the woman can
kick the shit out of both of us 
 it may have seemed different to you 
 i didn t harass her 
she harassed me 
i ve never heard of a woman
harassing a man 
why re you here 
 i m here as your friend 
 my ass  you re my friend 
when garvin finds out about this 
he ll want to throw you out on your ass 
let s keep this quiet 
that s what meredith wants too 
resolve this quickly and quietly 
want your wife to find out 
we ll have to tell her at some point 
they ll get the whole thing
and it ll be on the front page of the paper 
i m offering you a chance
to make a new life 
keep your family out of this mess 
keep your job 
obviously  some kind of lateral move 
when you say lateral 
you mean out of the division 
you can t stay here 
she s scared out of her wits 
i m not leaving this division 
i spent ten years here  i built this place 
now  we got a spin off going on  
we re thinking  you know  austin 
austin 
i told him what she said 
he said the opposite happened 
he said she harassed him 
what 
he denies it 
you know  the man always denies it 
is he crazy 
i offered him a move to austin 
to austin  that s like a duck making
a lateral move to  a lorange   
he s too smart for that 
let s hope he s smart enough
to see he has no options 
take care of this 
this is a bomb we re sitting on
that can blow everything sky high 
meredith is key to the merger  i can t
have her involved in a sex scandal 
and i won t say good bye to  100 million 
you got that 
i get the picture  bob 
tenth floor  down the hall and right 
there were no witnesses 
her assistant left earlier in the night 
a cleaning lady was outside the office 
i don t know what she heard 
 did you report that to anyone 
 in the morning  yeah 
what was the company s response 
they believed her 
they suggested i transfer to austin 
i heard they re selling austin 
the point is  if i go to austin 
i lose everything  all right 
my stock options 
everything that i worked for 
did you call anyone after the incident 
no 
did you tell your wife 
oh  boy 
why not 
i didn t want to upset her 
i felt guilty being in that situation at all 
how would you characterize
miss johnson physically 
she s very pretty 
she was miss teenage new mexico 
so you kissed 
yes  and then she began to   rub me 
rub you where 
you know    
your penis 
yes 
and 
i m uncomfortable talking about it 
 because i m a woman 
 you act like it s a game 
 why are you here 
 i want to know what my options are 
what your options are 
i want to know whether i can sue her
for sexual harassment 
to do that you must convince a jury   
   you were alone with miss teenage
new mexico and you said   no  
sexual harassment   
   is not about sex 
it is about power 
she has it   
   you don t 
if you sue 
you ll never get another job in computers 
if you don t  you ll go to austin 
sue  and it s news  don t sue  it s gossip 
if you sue  no one will believe you 
if you don t  your wife won t 
they ll make your life hell for the
three years until the case goes to trial 
and  for that privilege 
it ll cost you a minimum of  100 000 
do you not think it s a game  mr  sanders 
it s a game to them 
how do you feel about losing 
that s what meredith wants 
to resolve it  quickly and quietly 
they said she s not going
to press charges  why 
she s accused me  why stop there 
why not press charges 
meredith didn t press charges   
   because she couldn t 
digicom is planning a merger
with conley white 
it is supposed to happen friday 
they think that we are as conservative
as they are 
with a scandal  conley goes to bed with
katie couric  wakes up to jessica hahn 
garvin is out  100 million 
i think we might make a plaintiff
out of this guy yet 
no  a potential plaintiff 
i don t have to sue  i just threaten to sue 
that s a dangerous game 
are you willing to play it 
fuck them 
now you re talking my language 
for the next three days   
   this loose cannon is in a position
to apply a lot of pressure 
and they on you  mr  sanders 
they on you 
call security 
throw him out on the sidewalk 
we have to appear to be impartial 
keep him in his job 
keep paying him  no hassles 
i made tom sanders 
who the hell is he to sue me 
sexual harassment  under title seven 
he ll file with the human rights
commission if we don t fire meredith 
if he files  it becomes public 
it d blow the deal 
we realize that  so does he 
he s blackmailing us 
this is america  goddamn it 
the legal system is supposed to
protect people like me 
it gets worse 
his lawyer is   
   catherine alvarez 
great  she d change her name to
 tv listings  just to get it in the paper 
i m trying to get them to mediate 
keep it quiet 
mediate 
i want you to cut his balls off 
did he say mediate or split the difference 
i m just hoping he ll agree 
alvarez will tell him not to 
he ll agree 
he doesn t want this public 
we pushed him too hard 
he has nothing to lose 
really  he hasn t told his wife yet 
how do you know 
i know sanders  remember 
he likes secrets 
 i ll be in diagnostics 
 where were you 
they re pulling the drives apart 
 john levin called 
 john levin with sematach 
he said it s important 
 why didn t they come this morning 
 susan called about the benefit

 the lewyns paid for the tickets 
 i ll be there at 7 30

everything is fine  thanks for asking 
i ll kill arthur 
we must solve this before friday
and you just got the drives  
what is arthur doing over there 
all he does anymore is give
macadamia nuts to people 
is he a manager or a stewardess 
 he gave you nuts 
 what s slowing it down 
over here 
let me show you something 
arthur was right 
there s a compatibility problem
with the controller chip 
is it a bug 
don cherry debugged arcamax 
there are no bugs 
fabrication problem 
what re you doing 
this is a sophisticated piece
of electronics  not a pickup truck 
how bad is it  we have 4 000 of these 
should i junk them all 
i told arthur to send ten in heat sealed
plastic bags  it s a hunch i have 
do what you can 
i don t understand it 
in prototypes  no problem 
in manufacturing  it falls apart 
mr  garvin wants to see you 
he said not to tell anyone 
catherine alvarez on two 
thanks  could you close the door 
how are you 
let s agree to mediate 
i don t want this getting out either 
if we get this all over in a week 
my wife needn t know 
i do not want to tell my wife 
i don t want to upset her if i don t have to 
wait a second 
guess what 
they locked me out of my computer
and cleaned out my files 
i guess it s starting 
come in 
i m not interrupting 
no  not at all 
going down 
don t tell me you re scared of me 
i don t want it to be this way 
yeah  we could be fucking right now 
 i think of you as a friend 
 oh  come off it 
you called blackburn  
only to beat you to the punch 
i knew you d play that card 
i wasn t playing a card 
you were the one that  
alarm 
this isn t a game 
you d have a great job 
the spin off would make you a millionaire 
we d have fun 
it s not like breaking rocks 
you don t get it 
poor sanders  you have no idea
what you re up against 
as usual 
by this time tomorrow
you ll wish you took the austin job 
we ll see 
we ll see 
i m trying to figure out whether
to get a fat barbie for eliza 
mattel makes a fat barbie 
it s called  happy to be me barbie  
does she come with the
 happy to be divorced ken  
i m serious 
which is more stigmatizing 
yeah  barbie s stigmatized 
it s that whole male 
36 24 36 image of beauty 
women are oppressed 
women are oppressed  
80    of suicides are committed by men 
they re dropping from heart attacks 
 you re not as tough 
 sorry  we re just fighting the wars 
you start the wars 
i m sorry 
i don t have my own crisis hot line 
 you re taking the meredith thing well 
 that has nothing to do with it 
what was today s rumor 
she was once a man 
just tell her 
tell her what 
tell her a lot of us have worked
as hard as you   
   and you re blowing this merger
for all of us because you fucked up 
what happened 
who got to you 
it s not that simple 
the thought of losing millions happens
to stick right here in my throat 
this was my big shot 
it s not like i m being scouted by the nba 
what happened 
who knows  an old girlfriend 
a bottle of wine  a late meeting   
    fill in the blanks 
 thanks 
you re like women who think they re in
the hotel room  drunk  to watch tv 
could you possibly be more lame 
for your information  mark 
tom told me everything 
everything that happened 
and i support him 100    
that is so sweet  but i don t think  
let s not discuss it 
let s just enjoy the evening 
obviously  something happened 
did you have sex 
 think first  because if you re lying  
 no  i said  no 
she kissed me  and she unzipped
my pants  and and and and and  
and 
and that was it 
how did it get that far 
 you think i encouraged her 
 her hand was in your pants 
 nothing happened 
 how did that happen 
then she accuses me
of sexual harassment  
 she harassed you 
 you don t believe me 
mark doesn t believe you 
he s got stock options on the brain 
he s back stabbing 
everybody s sure you re having
an affair with cindy 
 we re not having an affair 
 how could you let this happen 
 nothing happened 
 something happened 
she s an old girlfriend of yours 
like i m surprised  that club s
as exclusive as the white pages 
 i was going to tell you 
 i can t believe everyone knew but me 
 nobody knows it 
 you re so naive  of course they know 
i m old fashioned 
i greet my inferiors with a handshake 
i ll handle it 
jesus 
what does she look like 
she s attractive 
one to ten 
eight 
nine 
what does the company say 
they want me to transfer to austin 
do some therapy 
austin 
i m not moving there 
we re not moving to austin 
 i m pressing charges 
 for what 
sexual harassment 
we have a mediation tomorrow 
when were you going to tell me 
that s brilliant 
show up without your wife 
 i ll handle it 
 are you crazy  they ll destroy you 
 it won t go that far 
 it ll take over our life 
depositions and whispering and legal
fees for some damn personal vindication 
and all people remember is that
you were involved in something sleazy 
 do you have a lawyer 
 catherine alvarez 
great  when are we on hard copy 
but if it had happened to you  
you know how many times
it s happened to me 
 you never said this ever happened  
 you re so narcissistic 
nothing happens until
it happens to you 
 you should ve said something 
 i do what women always do 
i deal with it  now go in there tomorrow
and work it out 
right  i should shut up and fuck her 
apologize and get your job back 
apologize  
the children are sleeping 
wait  i got a better idea 
why don t i just admit it 
i ll be the evil male you all complain
about  then i can fuck everybody 
tom  stop it 
come  i want to dominate you 
you re scaring her 
i have a urge 
the children 
my children that i provide for and protect 
they can come between me and my wife 
move us  take my job   
   and take the house we have made 
and i apologize to them  susan 
they call me a rapist and i apologize 
this is a joke 
sexual harassment is about power 
when did i have the power 
when 
good morning  i m judge murphy 
this is a mediation 
our proceedings are confidential 
maintain a civil and courteous tone 
our goal is to determine the nature
of the dispute   
   and how best to resolve it 
the parties have agreed that
mr  sanders will speak first   
   and be cross examined by mr  heller 
ms  johnson will speak next 
and be cross examined by ms  alvarez 
any questions 
let s get started 
i had my cellular phone with me 
so when she called garvin   
   l called mark lewyn to give him
the upshot of our meeting 
then she approached you 
correct  she took the phone
from me and she kissed me 
where 
she kissed me in my ear   
   on my neck   
   on my mouth 
she put her tongue in my mouth 
when you asked her to stop  did she 
no  no 
she unzipped my pants   
   and massaged my penis 
 were you aroused 
 yes 
then she slid down   
   and she   
   put my penis in her mouth 
did you climax 
i grabbed her by the wrists 
i threw her on the ground 
then i wanted to leave 
then what did ms  johnson do 
she threatened me 
she said   you re dead  
and then  the next day 
mr  blackburn told me that   
   she said that i had
sexually harassed her 
mr  heller 
 mr  sanders  would you like a break 
 no  i m fine 
you say the bottle of wine
was ms  johnson s idea 
yes 
but when you were living
with ms  johnson   
   didn t you discover wines together
on trips to the napa valley 
yes 
romantic trips 
yes 
but you didn t expect any romance
in her office 
did you have a conversation
after lunch about how   
   seeing meredith gave you a   
   boner 
someone else said that 
isn t the term  boner 
a slang for erection 
you had a conversation about   
   having an erection  a boner 
yes  but i didn t say it 
but you laughed 
yes 
so you condone it 
it was harmless 
if it s harmless   
   why are we here today 
well  it was just   
   what guys talk about 
about their boners 
not generally  no 
yet you expect us to believe that
after having a sexual conversation   
   you weren t thinking of sex 
that s correct 
how would you characterize your
prior relationship with ms  johnson 
highly sexual 
i don t know how to rate it 
every day 
sometimes twice a day 
sex in public places 
sodomy 
viewing of pornography 
vibrators and other mechanical devices 
sometimes we sat on the
couch and watched television 
but when you became reacquainted 
you no longer saw her as a sexual object 
 she was just your boss now 
 that s correct 
and do you admit having an
erection during your meeting 
she had her top open 
it was an involuntary reflex 
reflex 
do you think her gynecologist gets an
erection when he examines her breast 
that s completely different 
do you admit putting
your penis in her mouth 
she did 
oh  i forgot 
you resisted 
mr  sanders 
during your rather fantastic testimony   
   there was one moment that rang true 
you said  and i quote 
 i was angry 
 i felt i was being pushed around  
correct 
the truth is  you felt that way all day 
you d been expecting a promotion and
she got it  you got angry about it 
i felt i deserved the job 
you took that anger up to her office 
you d show her who s boss 
that s not true 
did you tell your wife about your
seven o clock meeting with ms  johnson 
i had a meeting and i d be home late 
you expected to be late 
no  but if i got home earlier
my wife would be pleasantly surprised 
so you make it a rule to lie to your wife 
i didn t lie 
when you called your wife 
did you tell her that   
   ms  johnson was a
former lover of yours 
when you got home 
did you tell her what happened 
no  i hoped it would go away 
you hoped you d get away with it 
do not debunk the illusion that this
dispute might be settled amicably 
that s okay 
i have no further questions 
i asked to see pictures 
i thought if we put it on that basis   
   it would be clear that things
had changed between us 
do you have those pictures now 
i d like copies for my file 
you can continue 
he said his wife hadn t lost all the weight
gained from pregnancy 
his children were beautiful   
   but they made him feel old   
   and seeing me reminded him
of what it was like to be young   
   and marriage was a tough trade off 
go on 
my assistant  mrs  ross 
asked if she could go home 
i wanted her to stay  but felt guilty 
i d kept her late for weeks
preparing for my new job 
and where was mr  sanders
at that point 
he began to rub my shoulders 
and you let him 
it was awkward   
   but i thought we d end
the meeting and leave it at that 
then he tried to kiss you 
no  mr  garvin called and
then i came back to tom   
   and said that was it 
and then he began to kiss me 
did you try to stop him 
yes  i struggled with him
and told him to stop  but he didn t 
did he attack you physically 
yes 
he grabbed me by my hair   
   and forced me down on my knees 
and    
he put his   
   penis in your mouth 
this is making me uncomfortable 
want some water 
thank you 
he put his penis in my mouth   
   and said that he was going to    
to  fuck you   were those his words 
he said   do you want to get fucked  
and then he reached down
and tore off my panties 
what did you do then 
he threw me down on the scaffold
and i kneed him in the groin 
and that was the end of it 
it s strange  i d think my instinct
would be to run  but i became angry 
i yelled at him  called him names 
told him i d kill him 
just yelling 
how did he react 
he seemed to realize what he d done 
he pulled up his pants and left 
did you call anyone afterwards 
no 
i didn t know what to do 
i kept going over the day in my
mind trying to figure out   
   if somehow this thing was my fault 
you reported it the next day 
yes 
but you didn t bring formal charges 
why not 
i talked to phil blackburn 
i knew he was tom s friend 
i didn t want to destroy   
   tom s marriage or career 
but it s clear we couldn t work together 
i would be too scared 
i m scared just sitting here 
nothing further 
ms  alvarez 
ms  johnson 
i just want to be clear on one thing 
mr  sanders suggested
the bottle of wine 
 that s right 
 but you bought it 
i sent my assistant mrs  ross
out to buy a bottle 
that afternoon 
did you tell her what kind 
i said to get a nice chardonnay 
i knew tom liked white wine 
from those trips to napa that
he was an amateur connoisseur 
he d be impressed by a nice bottle 
yes 
do you remember the wine 
no 
the  91 pahlmeyer 
that s right 
do you know where your
assistant got that wine 
i assume she got it at a liquor store 
would it surprise you to know   
   that no liquor store in
seattle carries that bottle 
mrs  ross is very resourceful 
very resourceful 
a bottle of wine you can t find
within 500 miles of seattle 
i have no idea where she
got the bottle of wine 
isn t it true  ms  johnson 
that you told mrs  ross three weeks ago   
   that you wanted
a bottle of  91 pahlmeyer   
   for this meeting 
that s not true 
and when she couldn t find it  you said    
what was that 
it had such managerial brio 
here it is 
 if you don t find the wine   
    find a replacement  
do you have testimony from mrs  ross 
yes  i do 
ms  johnson 
the fact is mrs  ross
has personal problems 
she has a drinking problem 
she makes up stories to make
herself seem more important 
i told mrs  ross to go buy a bottle
of wine after tom and i spoke   
   at the luncheon 
maybe she had that bottle at home 
maybe in her wine cellar 
any more questions 
no  not for now 
i think this is a good time for a break 
i got some information on meredith 
you won t believe it  or maybe you will 
alan gave me a list 
we can t verify any of this 
 you said you didn t have sex 
 i didn t 
i didn t have sex with her 
what is it  tom 
she s trying to quit smoking 
 it s true 
 how could you do this 
she did it  that s the point 
you saw this woman alone 
you had wine  a back rub  you kissed 
and then this non sex sex thing 
you took off her panties 
those are facts 
so what 
 that doesn t happen unless you want it 
 i was cornered 
 you let it happen 
 i did not 
how could you  how could you
let that woman into our lives 
get this 
ten of her subordinates transferred
in the last five years  all men 
what a red flag 
can you see them 
yeah  but no one will talk and we can t
subpoena them just for a mediation 
 do you want to have lunch 
 i must go back to work 
how about you  are you hungry 
how are you holding up 
are you married 
chandler  hogue and alvarez 
 i married chandler 
 you married your boss 
classic case of sexual harassment  he
asked me out five times before i said yes 
today  if i had said no once 
he would have been afraid to ask again 
tom said you re a lawyer 
ten years 
 let s switch hats  what do you think 
 i don t look good in hats 
you re afraid she s telling the truth 
yes 
what he did  he did out of weakness 
hardly makes it better  does it 
i can t get in the middle
of your relationship with tom   
   but she did break the law
and that makes the difference 
ms  alvarez  48 hrs ago  my husband s
penis was in another woman s mouth 
there s nothing in the law
that ll help me deal with that 
when did these arrive 
came in an hour ago 
garvin had me send the corridor
to the hotel for the conley people to use 
it s at the hotel 
yeah  the conley people had
such fun with it yesterday    
getting anywhere with the drives 
i m counting on you 
 i have a hunch 
 what is it 
 i don t know 
 what is it 
i don t know 
she got to you  didn t she 
what else  they re stronger 
they re smarter and they don t fight fair 
it s the next step in the human evolution 
keep some of us for sperm
and kill the rest 
what do you have 
if i know something for a fact 
i won t withhold it 
but i can t go out on a limb 
it s too intense around here 
i m 23  i can t wake up tomorrow and
find i m out of the computer business 
why aren t you at the mediation 
i just came back to     this was
the last thing i needed this week 
come in 
something s come up 
i need to know exactly
what happened that night 
well  it s exactly like i told phil 
you re not talking to phil 
we have sanders  phone records 
it s possible someone overheard you two 
john levin called again 
find out what it s about 
he must talk to you personally 
i don t want to talk to him now 
can i talk to you 
cindy   
   are you  a friend  
a friend 
you know   
    a friend   a friend 
i depends on what you mean
by  a friend  
all right  never mind 
he s heading for the elevator 
heading back to the mediation 
 yeah  i must get back 
 i ll give you a lift 
don t you think it s time we talked 
i understand you both had
a chance to get it off your chest 
your version of what happened 
now i want it to stop 
what i got off my chest
was not a version 
it s always a version 
that s the legacy of the modern age 
we have information but no truth 
flashes of electrons in a grain of sand 
i m telling the truth 
 you must look at this from all sides 
 how many sides are there 
all right  let s say she made a mistake 
so what 
she made a pass  that s all 
you could have decided it was flattering 
you could have handled it many ways 
but this vindictiveness   
   l must say  i m surprised 
it s against the law 
i work for her 
i m employed by her 
no  you work for me 
that s what i m saying 
after all these years  why didn t you
come to me  not hire this lawyer 
maybe i should have 
i mean  why can t you just forget it 
work together like adults and
everyone makes a pile of money 
 what s wrong with that 
 it s gone too far 
things can go back 
why would he offer to settle now 
he realized how much they got to lose 
no  it doesn t add up 
maybe there s a vulnerability
we don t know about 
i m still getting messages
from  a friend   i printed out the address 
maybe you can check it out 
i hope digicom doesn t find him first 
remember the cleaning lady 
she s out of town  no one knows
where or when she s coming back 
the bahamas  probably 
with mrs  ross soon to join her 
these guys play hardball 
did mr  sanders ever touch you in a way
that makes you feel uncomfortable 
he s not aware of it 
just answer the question  please 
yes 
how 
he ll pat me on my behind or   
   rub my shoulders 
rub your shoulders 
i don t think he means anything by it 
you don t like it 
i just feel it s inappropriate 
i don t see the relevance of this 
we re trying to establish
a pattern of behavior 
sexual harassers generally
follow a pattern 
i ll allow it 
do you have chiropractic problems 
any neck problems  or your back 
no 
so you would characterize
this behavior as flirting   
   or sexual 
 i suppose so 
 but you never said anything 
he s my boss 
you didn t report it 
he s your boss  i understand 
your job is at stake  rumors 
whether people would believe you 
and if i ask you if you ever had any
sexual relations with mr  sanders   
   same answer 
no  i didn t 
didn t report it 
 it never happened 
 i understand 
i have no more questions 
barbara called   
    about the disneyland tickets for    
 jafar 
he s got the tickets
and an upgrade at the hotel 
thank you  i appreciate it 
they gave me your photos 
i ll see you later 
yes  i ll see you later 
you know   
   it s funny how you always
assumed you d get the job 
lewyn assumed it would be him or you 
but nobody ever thought for a second
it might be me 
isn t that funny 
that s not true  you were on the list 
really 
let me guess   hunter 
not someone you d follow into battle 
 a team player  no killer instinct 
 doesn t have those tools  
what is that all a code for 
what  you on meredith s side 
i studied engineering for eight years 
i was the only woman in the department 
you know what i did 
i worked 
you think i m on meredith s side 
what do you want to do 
what 
their offer ends midnight  it s what
garvin said  you get your job back 
she s your boss 
everyone goes back to work 
did you find  a friend  
did we get the address 
dr  arthur friend  a chemistry professor
from the university of washington   
   who s been in nepal
the last three weeks 
you got messages from a locked office 
i m glad we got that one solved 
shit  i have to call lewyn 
the drives we re having
problems with came in 
only you 
anyone else would be sabotaging
the company  not solving their problems 
it s adele and mark 
we re not home  leave a message
and we ll call you back 
what 
mark s wife s voice is on the machine 
but on monday it was a man s voice 
then the next day mark said
he never got the message 
i dialed the wrong number that night 
so 
that s why the battery was dead 
what are you talking about 
that s why garvin wants to deal 
he s got my phone records 
i ve got a ten minute phone bill
while i m in meredith s office 
she took the phone away 
i called the wrong number   
   but i never hung up the phone 
the phone line is open 
somebody s got this whole
thing on an answering machine 
it s levin  not lewyn 
what s going on 
i ve been getting phone calls 
some creep has my visa   
   then  at the office 
everything s turned upside down 
have they got the tape 
what i m saying is 
it s good i brought it home 
 my girlfriend and i listened to it 
 where s the tape 
it s all here 
i ve been trying to get
a hold of you all week 
you know what this means 
do you have any idea what this means 
thanks  pal 
no deal  no  no deal  catherine 
we re going to bury them 
everything is on tape 
yes  everything 
put it in 
god  look at us 
go inside me 
i can t do this 
 do it 
 i won t 
now  come on  now 
you can t just stop  you can t 
no  goddamn it 
you stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality 
this never happened 
you never used to be this way 
in any judicial proceeding 
this tape would be inadmissible 
i m worried i m going to drive to work
and hear it on howard stern 
is she threatening 
i don t know how many copies
of this tape there are 
i didn t put it out there 
this tape just shows consensual
sex between adults   
   however it may have
appeared the next day 
mr  sanders  regret
is not my client s harassment 
ms  johnson 
is that your position today 
yes  it is 
ms  alvarez 
just so i m clear on what today s story is   
   would you define for me
 consensual sex  
sex where both parties
are willing participants 
how many times did we hear
mr  sanders say  no  
i don t know  i was busy listening
to my panties being torn off 
31  
31 times 
doesn t  no  mean  no  
sometimes  no  means that person
wants to be overwhelmed  dominated 
the way we re supposed to have sex
nowadays we d need un supervision 
 no  means  no  
isn t that what we tell women 
do men deserve less 
when he really wanted to stop
he had no problems doing it 
and you got angry 
of course i did  anyone would 
we tell women they can stop at any point 
haven t you ever said
 no  and meant  yes  
until the moment of penetration  
he was willing 
that tape doesn t change anything 
you controlled the meeting 
you set the time  you ordered the wine 
you demanded service and got
angry when he didn t provide it 
so you decided to get rid of him
with this trumped up charge 
the only thing you have proven
is that a woman in power   
   can be every bit as abusive as a man 
you want to put me on trial 
let s be honest about why 
i am sexually aggressive  i like it 
tom knew it and you can t handle it 
it s the same thing since
the beginning of time 
veil it  hide it  lock it up
and throw away the key 
we expect a woman to do a man s
job  make a man s money   
   then lie down for a man to fuck
her like it was 100 years ago 
well  no  thank you 
you won t believe this  i think
the howard stern thing got to them 
 what did phil say 
 you get your job back 
you get  100 000 in pain and suffering 
and i get fees and expenses 
meredith 
she stays through the merger 
then they say   
   she has to leave for some
whatever emergency  she s out 
this is total and complete vindication 
it s over 
i almost feel sorry for him 
he has no idea  does he 
i d like to read this over again before
we sign  not that i don t trust you 
just as long as it s done
by midnight tonight 
garvin wants this off his screen 
we want you to make
a presentation on arcamax   
   at the merger announcement
tomorrow 
nothing technical  four minutes 
fine 
great 
now i ve got to go break it to her 
it won t be easy 
i thought you enjoyed
that kind of thing 
you go after one of our people 
we ll put the wagons in a circle 
once you made your case 
the company behaved appropriately 
right 
 you don t want to know what i think 
 it s terrible 
way a thing like this can   
   tear a company apart 
i told bob we really need
to take a look at it 
friends 
what 
i hope you still think of me as a friend 
good night  phil 
sign it now and i ll read it later 
where will you be 
here  working on the presentation 
if not  i ll have somebody
run this by your house later 
let me ask you something 
why d she do this 
you ve seen her in action 
she s cool  smart and in control 
 how d she lose control like this 
 i don t know 
you re attractive  maybe 
 but not irresistible 
 i m serious  she s here one day 
there s a merger going on 
conley people are touchy 
she thought you d go along 
 there s more to it than that 
 come on 
you think too much 
you need to go home   
   open a nice bottle of champagne   
   make up with your wife
and get some sleep 
it s over 
thank you 
absolutely  you re welcome 
good night 
good night 
hi  stephanie 
must be difficult 
nobody giving you information 
it s been a crazy week 
i had a friend  she was one
of the first women to move high up 
you know what it s like 
every day putting out fires 
it turned out the job
wasn t what she thought 
she was looking the wrong
way when they fired her 
interesting 
truth usually is  once you get to it 
it s you 
where is everyone 
mr  garvin came in an hour ago 
said they were working too hard 
sent everyone home 
 what if sanders doesn t bring it up 
 he will 
i talked to him about his
presentation on arcamax 
he has no idea 
when he brings up the line    
you must pounce because we
don t have the harassment 
it must be that sanders is incompetent 
it ll be in public  with reporters 
bob s counting on you 
let s clean out the database 
and any backup 
catherine  can you hold on one minute 
has my contract gone out already 
shit 
what does it say about firing me 
they can fire me for cause 
can t they  for incompetence 
the problem with the drives is not
with the programming or the design 
it s with the production line
and that s my responsibility 
this whole thing tomorrow   
   they re setting me up 
housekeeping  please 
this is mr  conley 
could someone come
and turn down my bed 
my room number 
it s on the phone here somewhere    
that s right 
thank you very much 
 when does your dad arrive 
 midnight  they stopped in houston 
i d love for him to get a chance
to see the corridor 
you know   
   l stayed up late last night 
fooling around with it up in my room 
it s really incredible 
i m sorry  sir 
here  thank you 
 you re welcome 
 good night 
have a nice evening 
you re in the corridor  our prototype
for a virtual reality database 
enjoy the demonstration 
information accessed during this demo
is for entertainment value only   
   and should not be duplicated
to another database 
if you have any questions 
ask the angel 
malaysian operations 
searching malaysian revisions file 
why don t we go up to my suite 
give my colleagues a chance
to try out the corridor 
good idea 
 reduction of air handling capacity
from number 7 air handlers   
    to a more appropriate
and cost effective number 5  
you can t put number 5 handlers in there 
you ll have dirt in everything 
my god  she s in the system 
angel  i need help 
help is here 
can i stop files from being deleted 
i m sorry  you re not level 5 
you re supposed to protect the files 
sysop controls are restricted to level 5 
show me all communications
with malaysia 
telephone or video 
video 
show me the last transmission
involving meredith 
sooner or later  tom will figure out
the changes at the plant 
he s not stupid 
tom will be out of the picture
by tuesday 
i don t like to gamble 
i love tahoe  but i think the risk  
think  who ll believe him 
he s married  with a family 
he ll have no choice but to take
the settlement and leave 
then we say sanders made the changes
at the plant  he ll deny it 
he won t know 
he ll be gone by then 
these things are so darn complicated 
i think it s upside down 
there we go 
who s first 
must have left the system on 
give it a try  you ll love it 
i d love to try it 
i am totally screwed 
i ll make my presentation   
   meredith will ask me questions 
she ll make me look totally incompetent 
are you sure there s not
another system somewhere 
the system has been completely deleted 
so i m a sitting duck 
i ll be walking around like
a ghost with a resume 
it s mohammed jafar 
how are you 
i don t mean to bug you 
but we re departing monday  
it s my fault  susan got the
disneyland tickets for you 
the e tickets 
you re comped for all the rides
and at the hotel they ll upgrade you 
magnificent  i can t wait to tell my wife 
she said you were full of shit 
you know how women are 
yes  i sure do 
i miss your face 
talk to arthur  he sees it enough
on the dvl  i m always  
tom  are you there 
mohammed  on this end 
we back up our files on dat 
do you do the same over there 
i don t know what we have 
i d have to check it out  why 
i got a real problem here 
i m up against the wall and   
   l need you to do some
things for me  mohammed 
i hope we have what you need  tom 
daddy 
i never believed what they said about you 
thank you  honey 
come here  big guy 
thank you 
those from malaysia 
i can t believe it s still coming out 
it started at seven 
testing 
put these in one of the files 
yeah  there s a real talent to fishing 
first you must choose the right bait   
   then you must know when to reel it in 
about the other day  i didn t mean    
yes  you did 
i apologize  and   
   thank you 
i accept 
which brings us to our
advanced products group 
tom sanders heads our
manufacturing department 
tom  can you come up here   
   and review for us the revolutionary
new product we call arcamax 
thank you  meredith 
arcamax is our own stand alone
cd rom drive player 
now  for a cd rom drive to be effective 
it must be portable   
   it has to be fast 
arcamax is twice as fast as any
cd rom drive in the world today 
we ve had our problems 
but we are solving them 
and were the problems with the design 
no  there are fabrication problems
involving the production line 
what sort of problems 
for example  we should be using
automatic chip installers to lock   
   the control chip on 
the malaysians have been
doing it by hand   
   jamming the chips in with their thumbs 
and the quality of the air is dirty 
we should use level 7 air handlers 
we re using level 5 
and we re ordering our components 
like hinge rods and clips 
not from our singapore supplier   
   but from someone who s a lot
cheaper but also less reliable 
i m confused  you set up this line 
you didn t anticipate these problems 
the line was changed 
the specifications were altered 
how is that possible  we know
you to be a competent manager 
you should know 
you ordered the changes 
i don t know how you got that idea 
you were in kuala lumpur last year 
to settle a labor dispute 
i ve never even seen the line 
you haven t 
no  i don t know who told you i  
you re watching malaysian channel 3 
perhaps instead of digging up
malaysian video clips   
   we should discuss the problems here   
   the problems in your department
with the line you set up 
all right 
the first memo in the file being handed
out is signed by meredith johnson 
it states that manual labor will
be used to install the chips 
that made the malaysian
government happy 
it also meant voltage irregularities
and memory allocation  
the malay government
insisted we fill those jobs 
the malaysian government does
not own shares of digicom 
these people here do 
the second memo   
   reduces the air handling
capacity in order to cut costs 
and that s why we re getting dirt in
the split optics  the drive arms 
the resulting delays will actually
increase the costs by more than 70    
 the third memo regarding  
 the drives are your responsibility 
these problems were created
because of your incompetence 
that s what s wrong 
passing the buck 
back stabbing 
i m not done 
this so called evidence of yours
is fooling no one 
you can protect your turf
and think it means something 
you weren t told of these decisions
because they re over your head 
this merger is about synergy   
   between hardware and software 
between cash flow and capital needs 
that s a language you can t understand 
i don t either 
we re buying this company
because they build things 
you understand what she means 
i m trying to convey the sentiments
of everyone here 
that s what i meant to do 
could you step outside for a moment 
can you build the darn thing or not 
yes  sir  we can 
they re replacing meredith 
garvin s announcing it in ten minutes 
ten minutes 
i m surprised you didn t come to gloat 
gloating is underrated  i actually
came here to pick up the arcamax files 
some smart people underrated you 
thank you 
not including myself 
i beat you  i beat you fair and square 
garvin lost his nerve 
it was his brilliant idea
to fire you for incompetence 
him and phil 
now i m being fired 
i ve never seen you play the victim 
it s the only good quality you had 
i m playing the game men set up 
and i m being punished for it 
it s fine 
i ve had calls from ten
head hunters with job offers 
don t be surprised if i m back
in ten years to buy this place 
did it ever occur to you  meredith 
that maybe i set you up 
 this is my son  spencer 
 how you doing 
 good 
 you re at the university of washington 
that s great  very good 
what a week 
the chinese say 
 may you live in interesting times  
this merger is the most
interesting merger i ve had   
   since my second marriage 
the merger is complete 
the question now is   
   who do we find to run things
up here in seattle 
and what i realized during this   
   very interesting week   
   is that i have probably
focused too much on   
   breaking the glass ceiling 
finding a woman to run things here   
   when i should have been
looking for the best person   
   to run things here 
someone whose   
   long service with this company
has established a record   
   of creativity   
   sound judgement   
   and hands on expertise 
and that person   
   is stephanie kaplan 
congratulations  stephanie 
i tell you something 
she s the greatest 
thank you 
first  i d like to take the opportunity
to thank the department heads 
   mary anne hunter
and mark lewyn here   
   and don cherry  where are you 
there he is 
and particularly  tom sanders   
   who epitomizes the inventiveness
of this division   
   its past and its future 
i m counting on you to be my right hand 
thank you 
we are heading into a new millennium   
   a new time 
you a chemistry major  spencer 
yeah  i am 
i know a chemistry professor there 
arthur friend  a  friend 
i don t know if he teaches freshmen 
i m his research assistant 
so if arthur friend was in nepal 
for example   
   you d have the keys to his
office and computer password 
we all work so well together
