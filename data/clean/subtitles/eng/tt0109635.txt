i wonder why garvin came by the office
at eight in the morning
to congratulate you
he treats everyone like dirt
except the top guys
except the top guys
when this merger with conleywhite
goes through
and they spin off our division
were going to be rich
were already rich
no i mean
really rich
my grandmother used to say
dont climb up there too close to god
he might shake the tree
tom

malaysian video linkup
you look good awake
whats wrong with arcamax
the drives are very slow were
getting seek times in the 140160 range
140 isnt a sexy cd player anymore
everyone has 140
my guys think theres
a compatibility problem
between the controller chip
and the drivers software
thatll put us back a year
the screen flickers the current cuts
in and out its a design problem
what do you mean
all laptops have the same design
i sent you out some drives
you should get them today
this is bad arthur
how could this happen
going to bury it until the merger
dont you say anything
does anyone else know
im a grave what are you kidding tom
i still think really
that arcamax will be a major major hit
ill call you when i see the drives
did you get the macadamia nuts
good night arthur
they are so good
hes off the phone i got to go
do you know a meredith johnson
yes years ago
she wanted to see you
shes here for the lunch
the entire company came for this lunch
garvin brought up the operations group
meredith is in operations
what should i tell her
bad day inlaws in town
im going to see lewyn about the 900s
stop worrying
if there was bad news
garvin wouldve sent phil blackburn
phil
are you coming to see me
no why
nothing how are you
how are you tom
you look all beat up
i do
youre letting it get to you
dont take it personally
take what personally
maybe its just a rumor
whats a rumor
i dont want to spread rumors
thats how these things get started
you mean austin
who said that
what am i missing
i cant believe he didnt tell you
hes so perverse
tell me what
so hows susan
susans good
hows lonnie
great
did you know she got tenure
thats great
heres my stop
i tried to explain to garvin
you know him hes like a child
fuck your feelings if they interfere
with his surprise
what surprise
rumor is youre getting passed over
so im not getting the vp job
thats the rumor
rumors are always true
garvin didnt say anything
came by the office i was late
susan had a conference
you were late today
whyre you in seattle
good to see you again
somebody tells garvin i was talking
to you you know how he is about leaks
leak i thought it was a rumor
it was different before
i could watch your back
who gets the job stephanie kaplan
rumor is he went outside the group
youd still head up manufacturing
presumably
wait a minute
i might be out of a job
dont get paranoid
im a quick learner
you wouldnt make someone vp
and not let them appoint their own team
how would that look
am i out of a job
come on tom
im already out on a limb
are you okay you want a prozac
no im fine
im disappointed but im fine
you sure
dont worry about me
im a stockholder whatevers
best for the company
leave a message for susan tom
matt and eliza after the beep
thanks for calling bye
obviously hes disappointed
but he took it well
overall id say yes
no bumps before the merger
i dont want him quitting
its up to you
just one big happy family
you got that
i have to say going down to see him
this morning was a masterstroke
it really put him on the defensive
ill keep an eye on him
hell get on the program
when push comes to shove
he has no guts
let me ask you something
you know susan
if i heard a rumor about the
future of the company
my future
you know nothing crazy
a real rumor
what would susan say
you think shed say to see garvin
heres someone you should meet
tom sanders
he heads up manufacturing
steven chase crescent capital
john conley
youre john conley
junior dads coming on friday
with members of the board
catch you at the lunch
tom come in
you wanted to see me
yeah sorry about this morning
you know how kids are
have you met meredith johnson
whats wrong
thats a hello youd give to a rash
im preoccupied its not you
we go way back he broke my heart
shes making that up
i thought your heart was made of plastic
he said i could be anything i wanted
he was right
it was a line
it wasnt a line
i didnt know you were acquainted
wilde said i like a man with a future
and a woman with a past
i heard you were in operations
i dont know am i
the last few years ive been cleaning
up the mess bob made of this company
if its such a mess why am i so rich
yes but youre a lot richer now
we should catch up get together
id love that
plenty of time now
flying over wyoming
i thought the merger was dead
conley was choking on the valuation
the spinoff was merediths idea
conley thinks it was their idea
really
lit them up like a christmas tree
she saved the merger
you have money now
you can even buy a new tie
so what was it
you wanted to see me about
meredithfuckingjohnson
sonofabitch goddamn garvin
what happened
i didnt get it
youre not the new vp
he announced it
it was a secret
hes got her installed in the office
bouncing quips back and forth
who
whos she
will this affect the spinoff
she doesnt know the difference
between software and a sweater
what arent you telling us
i might be out of a job
you know what its like out there
what about the spinoff
they didnt tell me about me
would they tell me about the spinoff
im sorry
this is the worst day of my life
all right
who is she
let me guess attractive
what does that matter
nipples like pencil erasers
shes attractive very attractive
sleeping with garvin
thats why he got a nordic track
its a curse to be me
life holds no surprises
this is such a clich
how do you think a clich
becomes a clich
you mean like size doesnt matter
i have a thing for you
all right please
can we get some work done
we got a small problem with arcamax
its not the design
its not the code
any woman must be twice as good
as a man and work harder for less pay
clich grande
how does a clich become one
it is very weird
we know nothing about this woman
i do
i had a thing with her
you are amazing
it was years ago
youve seen more ass than a rental car
get a few more women in your life
so you can be a census
maybe you can sleep your way up
right
wait why why her and not tom
hes not attractive
men and women are different
not in a way that matters to you
are you saying im a virgin
meanwhile you were asking me
about the spinoff
garvin said it was her idea
its always such a pleasure to come here
and be with the
advanced products group
i feel such a warmth for the people here
i feel a kinship
and ive always wanted to give you
is this seat taken
the most advanced original
leadership that i could
how are you
sorry you didnt get the promotion
im sorry you didnt get it either
how long have you known
really that long
every time ive wanted to promote
a woman
to break the glass ceiling
its always the same story
but bob but bob
ive thought about it often since
my daughters death that had she lived
it would be extremely rare
that she ever got to run a company
so it has a special meaning
for me when i tell you
that when we announce the merger
we will also announce the new vp
for advanced operations and planning
in seattle
will be meredith johnson
unbelievable
thanks bob can i have the lights
the advanced products group has been
the heart of digicom for the last 10 years
advanced products has historically
consisted of four divisions
you seem to be spending
more time up here
my sons a freshman at the university
this way i get to see more of him
i thought it had to do with the merger
this merger means everything to garvin
give a man a 100 million
and you create a frustrated billionaire
the new compression algorithms
will shift industry standards
to fullres digitized video
at 60 fields a second
with platformindependent
risc processors supported by
a 32bit coloractive
conleys a conservative company
is meredith conservative
i dont know
i thought you knew her
is there anything you dont know
we offer through technology
what religion and revolution
have promised but never delivered
freedom from the physical body
freedom from race and gender
from nationality and personality
from place and time
communicating by cellular phone
and handheld computer
pda and builtin fax modem
we can relate to each
other as pure consciousness
smart touching base
with all the division heads
she didnt name them in her speech
does it mean something
only if she plans to make changes
phil said she wasnt planning
on making any changes
you know meredith
wait a minute
i must know am i out of a job
what was she bending your ear about
stephanie nothing just small talk
what all of a sudden
theres stephanie lite
she was talking about her son
at the university
sorry i didnt get to mention you
thats fine
im jammed all day but why
dont you come up at seven
well have a drink
and catch up on business
great
i remember how you liked
a good bottle of wine ill get one
whats she want to see you
at seven about
probably the arcamax problems we must
discuss it before conley asks questions
she doesnt give you a boner
because you know
i definitely have liftoff
what about you you got a woody
shes very nice
ill let you know what happens
dont do that
you have a sexual urge every 20 minutes
its a physical certainty
its hardwired into your brain
you cant fight it
why would you want to live a little
ten years from now youll need a forklift
to get a hard on
ill call you
ill count the minutes
whereve you been all day
i didnt get it
no they went outside the division
someone from operations
what can i say i got passed over
what can i say
so did you get the tickets for disneyland
no i know
but i promised the guy and its
mohammed jafar
thanks a lot probably wont be home
for dinner tonight
i love you too bye
are there any asset sale triggers
in the indenture

91  pahlmeyer
ive looked all over for it
i like all the boys under me to be happy
congratulations
thank you
i brought the files up for arcamax
if you want to see them

the diagrams
your family you have pictures

she looks like she always has food
in the refrigerator
she never lost the baby weight
she doesnt look like a refrigerator
i mean shes made a home for you
in my fridge ive got some champagne
and an orange
doesnt eliza look pretty
she looks like susan
it can be inhibiting
whats that
domesticity
youd be surprised
you cant jump her from behind
because you get excited by
the way she bends to pick up the soap
remember that
i remember that
and you miss it
theres compensations
of course lifes a series of tradeoffs
i wouldnt trade what i have
i wouldnt want you to
thats exactly why i can trust you
you have more to lose than i do
ill bring you up to speed
on the problems with the drives
you kept in good shape tom
nice and hard
thank you
its different now
youre my boss
its different
okay
rub my shoulders and ill listen
to your problems
the specs and the seek times
call for 100 milliseconds
we have that on the prototypes
but the drives coming offline

it might be a chip
answer my question
im trying to
understand the controller chip
positions the split optics
ill show you the schematic
no no no no rub
you cant understand the problem
do you have the drives
arthur sent five
i said no calls
its mr garvin
but after that nobody
is it all right if i leave for the day
thats fine mrs ross
youd rather talk about other things
than answer my question
because you dont know
you dont know what the problem is
but you cant say i dont know
because in your mind that means
you lose youre worthless men
what will you tell conley
i cant lie to them
talk about the prototypes they work
focus on the positive
were online its not
about the prototypes
they want to know if you can build it
i understand that
do you have a problem working for me
no
hi bob
you dont want to hear
about my hard day
yes thats hard work
let me get my docs together
the merger is about people not arcamax
theyre comfortable with me and bob
this isnt about some cdrom
thatll be obsolete in a year
if they ask
then you tell them you dont know
hi bob im here
ive got a great idea about that
go ahead
lewyn this is sanders
ive discussed the drives with meredith
she says dont tell the conley people
until we know exactly
what the problems are
that is the line for the eight am
meeting tomorrow
lets get down to business
wait a sec wait a sec
meredith wait a second

whered she come from
has she any technical background
no thats the thing with the merger
everythings changed

including the stock options
i dont care about stock options
ill work fulltime
im capable of supporting our family
just trying to help
youre too nice sometimes
i dont need you to fight
my battles for me thanks
right now some lucky girl
in the building will come after me
i deserve that but ask yourself
why does a man go with another girl
hes unhappy at home
because hes lonely
but that was before you fran
ive stopped running
why are you wearing a tshirt
you never do
i dont know just a little cold
what are you going to do
grin and bear it like i usually do
and hope it doesnt get worse
morning
morning bob
thats a nice suit
nice fabric
can i feel it
what is that wool
with a little bit of viscose
thats what makes the pants
drape so well
you work out
when i get a chance bob
its been busy lately
ive always liked you
now you have the power
you have something i want
come on
the computer takes the information
from the database
and constructs an environment
that is projected in the headset
when the user walks on the pad
he or she
feels like theyre walking in a hall
with drawers of files on all sides
the user can stop open any file
and look at the data the laser
scanners are for body representation
thats amazing
its cool isnt it
where is everyone
they left 15 minutes ago
don cherrys demoing the corridor
the meetings at 830
no 730 it got pushed up
nobody told you
if someone wants to log on with
a regular computer what theyll see
is a model of themselves with a photo
thats pulled up from a data file
hey i know you
the photo bears some
resemblance to me i admit
an inside joke here at the company
weve also constructed virtual help
users always need online help
we created an angel to help you
welcome to the corridor
the same face
angel
how do i open this drawer
whats the angel saying
thats between them
we dont see the corridor
as a product in the marketplace now
this is something that we worked
up to demonstrate the potential
of virtual reality technology
this looks good
hold on whats that
i believe its your financial records
turn that damn thing off
sorry
in the final system there will be
safeguards that will control access
so glad you could join us
that was a sweet entrance my friend
did the ferry hit an iceberg you were
going to call me after meeting meredith
i called you from her office
left a message
there was nothing on my machine
then youre late again
thank god meredith
led the discussion
hey pal i left a message
on your machine all right
check it out
did you get my message
you told susan the meeting
had been moved to 830
i said 730 if your wife cant take
a fucking message get a machine
there you go mr sanders
thank you
youre welcome
full house today
meredith has been getting us
up to speed on the arcamax
wed like your read on it
meredith said there are problems
you might have to go back
to the drawing board
im sorry if i conveyed that
impression to meredith
im convinced we can manufacture them
how many of the drives meet specs
i dont have that information with me
meredith told us the line is running
at 29 is that approximately right
the seek times are offspecs
theres a power flicker in the screen
right
thats right
with the merger impending
shouldnt you have told someone
the merger isnt about a cdrom
that might be obsolete in a year
its about people
itll be obsolete in a year
the promise of the arcamax
was a central factor in this merger
i may be at fault tom said the
problem with the drives was serious
not so serious
dont cover up
im not covering anything up
give us worst case
we go back to the drawing boards
and were down for nine months
nine months
meredith said six weeks
nobody likes to go back to the board
but it can be an advantage
is there a problem
this isnt an inquisition
i feel like im pulling teeth
john just wants to get a handle on
what the problems are with the lines
i dont know is the honest answer
wait a minute
you are head of manufacturing
you are in charge of arcamax
there are problems with it
that could take nine months to fix
which i assume means a year
and the bottom line is
you dont know
goddamn it
goddamn it
jesus christ
i wanted to see you
its not going to work out with meredith
evidently not
she set me up
i saw
she set me up
sit down
why whatd i do
please would you just sit
meredith told me
about your meeting last night
what
whatd she say
she wants to handle the intervention
internally which is best
she still cares about you
wait a minute
whatd she say
not to put too fine a point on it
she said you sexually harassed her
i sexually harassed her
what would you call it
she jumped me
she jumped you youre in denial
thats typical
she almost raped me
you need help
you must accept responsibility for
what about this
what about that
looks like she defended herself
defended herself the woman can
kick the shit out of both of us
it may have seemed different to you
i didnt harass her
she harassed me
ive never heard of a woman
harassing a man
whyre you here
im here as your friend
my ass youre my friend
when garvin finds out about this
hell want to throw you out on your ass
lets keep this quiet
thats what meredith wants too
resolve this quickly and quietly
want your wife to find out
well have to tell her at some point
theyll get the whole thing
and itll be on the front page of the paper
im offering you a chance
to make a new life
keep your family out of this mess
keep your job
obviously some kind of lateral move
when you say lateral
you mean out of the division
you cant stay here
shes scared out of her wits
im not leaving this division
i spent ten years here i built this place
now we got a spinoff going on
were thinking you know austin
austin
i told him what she said
he said the opposite happened
he said she harassed him
what
he denies it
you know the man always denies it
is he crazy
i offered him a move to austin
to austin thats like a duck making
a lateral move to a lorange
hes too smart for that
lets hope hes smart enough
to see he has no options
take care of this
this is a bomb were sitting on
that can blow everything skyhigh
meredith is key to the merger i cant
have her involved in a sex scandal
and i wont say goodbye to 100 million
you got that
i get the picture bob
tenth floor down the hall and right
there were no witnesses
her assistant left earlier in the night
a cleaning lady was outside the office
i dont know what she heard
did you report that to anyone
in the morning yeah
what was the companys response
they believed her
they suggested i transfer to austin
i heard theyre selling austin
the point is if i go to austin
i lose everything all right
my stock options
everything that i worked for
did you call anyone after the incident
no
did you tell your wife
oh boy
why not
i didnt want to upset her
i felt guilty being in that situation at all
how would you characterize
miss johnson physically
shes very pretty
she was miss teenage new mexico
so you kissed
yes and then she began torub me
rub you where
you know
your penis
yes
and
im uncomfortable talking about it
because im a woman
you act like its a game
why are you here
i want to know what my options are
what your options are
i want to know whether i can sue her
for sexual harassment
to do that you must convince a jury
you were alone with miss teenage
new mexico and you said no
sexual harassment
is not about sex
it is about power
she has it
you dont
if you sue
youll never get another job in computers
if you dont youll go to austin
sue and its news dont sue its gossip
if you sue no one will believe you
if you dont your wife wont
theyll make your life hell for the
three years until the case goes to trial
and for that privilege
itll cost you a minimum of 100000
do you not think its a game mr sanders
its a game to them
how do you feel about losing
thats what meredith wants
to resolve it quickly and quietly
they said shes not going
to press charges why
shes accused me why stop there
why not press charges
meredith didnt press charges
because she couldnt
digicom is planning a merger
with conleywhite
it is supposed to happen friday
they think that we are as conservative
as they are
with a scandal conley goes to bed with
katie couric wakes up to jessica hahn
garvin is out 100 million
i think we might make a plaintiff
out of this guy yet
no a potential plaintiff
i dont have to sue i just threaten to sue
thats a dangerous game
are you willing to play it
fuck them
now youre talking my language
for the next three days
this loose cannon is in a position
to apply a lot of pressure
and they on you mr sanders
they on you
call security
throw him out on the sidewalk
we have to appear to be impartial
keep him in his job
keep paying him no hassles
i made tom sanders
who the hell is he to sue me
sexual harassment under title seven
hell file with the human rights
commission if we dont fire meredith
if he files it becomes public
itd blow the deal
we realize that so does he
hes blackmailing us
this is america goddamn it
the legal system is supposed to
protect people like me
it gets worse
his lawyer is
catherine alvarez
great shed change her name to
tv listings just to get it in the paper
im trying to get them to mediate
keep it quiet
mediate
i want you to cut his balls off
did he say mediate or split the difference
im just hoping hell agree
alvarez will tell him not to
hell agree
he doesnt want this public
we pushed him too hard
he has nothing to lose
really he hasnt told his wife yet
how do you know
i know sanders remember
he likes secrets

ask her to bring me a shirt and jacket
is everything okay
everything is fine thanks for asking
ill kill arthur
we must solve this before friday
and you just got the drives
what is arthur doing over there
all he does anymore is give
macadamia nuts to people
is he a manager or a stewardess
he gave you nuts
whats slowing it down
over here
let me show you something
arthur was right
theres a compatibility problem
with the controller chip
is it a bug
don cherry debugged arcamax
there are no bugs
fabrication problem
whatre you doing
this is a sophisticated piece
of electronics not a pickup truck
how bad is it we have 4000 of these
should i junk them all
i told arthur to send ten in heatsealed
plastic bags its a hunch i have
do what you can
i dont understand it
in prototypes no problem
in manufacturing it falls apart
mr garvin wants to see you
he said not to tell anyone
catherine alvarez on two
thanks could you close the door
how are you
lets agree to mediate
i dont want this getting out either
if we get this all over in a week
my wife neednt know
i do not want to tell my wife
i dont want to upset her if i dont have to
wait a second
guess what
they locked me out of my computer
and cleaned out my files
i guess its starting
come in
im not interrupting
no not at all
going down
dont tell me youre scared of me
i dont want it to be this way
yeah we could be fucking right now
i think of you as a friend
oh come off it
you called blackburn
only to beat you to the punch
i knew youd play that card
i wasnt playing a card
you were the one that
alarm
this isnt a game
youd have a great job
the spinoff would make you a millionaire
wed have fun
its not like breaking rocks
you dont get it
poor sanders you have no idea
what youre up against
as usual
by this time tomorrow
youll wish you took the austin job
well see
well see
im trying to figure out whether
to get a fat barbie for eliza
mattel makes a fat barbie
its called happy to be me barbie
does she come with the
happy to be divorced ken
im serious
which is more stigmatizing
yeah barbies stigmatized
its that whole male
362436 image of beauty
women are oppressed
women are oppressed
80 of suicides are committed by men
theyre dropping from heart attacks
youre not as tough
sorry were just fighting the wars
you start the wars
im sorry
i dont have my own crisis hotline
youre taking the meredith thing well
that has nothing to do with it
what was todays rumor
she was once a man
just tell her
tell her what
tell her a lot of us have worked
as hard as you
and youre blowing this merger
for all of us because you fucked up
what happened
who got to you
its not that simple
the thought of losing millions happens
to stick right here in my throat
this was my big shot
its not like im being scouted by the nba
what happened
who knows an old girlfriend
a bottle of wine a late meeting
fill in the blanks
thanks
youre like women who think theyre in
the hotel room drunk to watch tv
could you possibly be more lame
for your information mark
tom told me everything
everything that happened
and i support him 100
that is so sweet but i dont think
lets not discuss it
lets just enjoy the evening
obviously something happened
did you have sex
think first because if youre lying
no i said no
she kissed me and she unzipped
my pants andandandandand
and
and that was it
how did it get that far
you think i encouraged her
her hand was in your pants
nothing happened
how did that happen
then she accuses me
of sexual harassment
she harassed you
you dont believe me
mark doesnt believe you
hes got stock options on the brain
hes backstabbing
everybodys sure youre having
an affair with cindy
were not having an affair
how could you let this happen
nothing happened
something happened
shes an old girlfriend of yours
like im surprised that clubs
as exclusive as the white pages
i was going to tell you
i cant believe everyone knew but me
nobody knows it
youre so naive of course they know
im oldfashioned
i greet my inferiors with a handshake
ill handle it
jesus
what does she look like
shes attractive
one to ten
eight
nine
what does the company say
they want me to transfer to austin
do some therapy
austin
im not moving there
were not moving to austin
im pressing charges
for what
sexual harassment
we have a mediation tomorrow
when were you going to tell me
thats brilliant
show up without your wife
ill handle it
are you crazy theyll destroy you
it wont go that far
itll take over our life
depositions and whispering and legal
fees for some damn personal vindication
and all people remember is that
you were involved in something sleazy
do you have a lawyer
catherine alvarez
great when are we on hard copy
but if it had happened to you
you know how many times
its happened to me
you never said this ever happened
youre so narcissistic
nothing happens until
it happens to you
you shouldve said something
i do what women always do
i deal with it now go in there tomorrow
and work it out
right i should shut up and fuck her
apologize and get your job back
apologize
the children are sleeping
wait i got a better idea
why dont i just admit it
ill be the evil male you all complain
about then i can fuck everybody
tom stop it
come i want to dominate you
youre scaring her
i have a urge
the children
my children that i provide for and protect
they can come between me and my wife
move us take my job
and take the house we have made
and i apologize to them susan
they call me a rapist and i apologize
this is a joke
sexual harassment is about power
when did i have the power
when
good morning im judge murphy
this is a mediation
our proceedings are confidential
maintain a civil and courteous tone
our goal is to determine the nature
of the dispute
and how best to resolve it
the parties have agreed that
mr sanders will speak first
and be crossexamined by mr heller
ms johnson will speak next
and be crossexamined by ms alvarez
any questions
lets get started
i had my cellular phone with me
so when she called garvin
l called mark lewyn to give him
the upshot of our meeting
then she approached you
correct she took the phone
from me and she kissed me
where
she kissed me in my ear
on my neck
on my mouth
she put her tongue in my mouth
when you asked her to stop did she
no no
she unzipped my pants
and massaged my penis
were you aroused
yes
then she slid down
and she
put my penis in her mouth
did you climax
i grabbed her by the wrists
i threw her on the ground
then i wanted to leave
then what did ms johnson do
she threatened me
she said youre dead
and then the next day
mr blackburn told me that
she said that i had
sexually harassed her
mr heller
mr sanders would you like a break
no im fine
you say the bottle of wine
was ms johnsons idea
yes
but when you were living
with ms johnson
didnt you discover wines together
on trips to the napa valley
yes
romantic trips
yes
but you didnt expect any romance
in her office
did you have a conversation
after lunch about how
seeing meredith gave you a
boner
someone else said that
isnt the term boner
a slang for erection
you had a conversation about
having an erection a boner
yes but i didnt say it
but you laughed
yes
so you condone it
it was harmless
if its harmless
why are we here today
well it was just
what guys talk about
about their boners
not generally no
yet you expect us to believe that
after having a sexual conversation
you werent thinking of sex
thats correct
how would you characterize your
prior relationship with ms johnson
highly sexual
i dont know how to rate it
every day
sometimes twice a day
sex in public places
sodomy
viewing of pornography
vibrators and other mechanical devices
sometimes we sat on the
couch and watched television
but when you became reacquainted
you no longer saw her as a sexual object
she was just your boss now
thats correct
and do you admit having an
erection during your meeting
she had her top open
it was an involuntary reflex
reflex
do you think her gynecologist gets an
erection when he examines her breast
thats completely different
do you admit putting
your penis in her mouth
she did
oh i forgot
you resisted
mr sanders
during your rather fantastic testimony
there was one moment that rang true
you said and i quote
i was angry
i felt i was being pushed around
correct
the truth is you felt that way all day
youd been expecting a promotion and
she got it you got angry about it
i felt i deserved the job
you took that anger up to her office
youd show her whos boss
thats not true
did you tell your wife about your
seven oclock meeting with ms johnson
i had a meeting and id be home late
you expected to be late
no but if i got home earlier
my wife would be pleasantly surprised
so you make it a rule to lie to your wife
i didnt lie
when you called your wife
did you tell her that
ms johnson was a
former lover of yours
when you got home
did you tell her what happened
no i hoped it would go away
you hoped youd get away with it
do not debunk the illusion that this
dispute might be settled amicably
thats okay
i have no further questions
i asked to see pictures
i thought if we put it on that basis
it would be clear that things
had changed between us
do you have those pictures now
id like copies for my file
you can continue
he said his wife hadnt lost all the weight
gained from pregnancy
his children were beautiful
but they made him feel old
and seeing me reminded him
of what it was like to be young
and marriage was a tough tradeoff
go on
my assistant mrs ross
asked if she could go home
i wanted her to stay but felt guilty
id kept her late for weeks
preparing for my new job
and where was mr sanders
at that point
he began to rub my shoulders
and you let him
it was awkward
but i thought wed end
the meeting and leave it at that
then he tried to kiss you
no mr garvin called and
then i came back to tom
and said that was it
and then he began to kiss me
did you try to stop him
yes i struggled with him
and told him to stop but he didnt
did he attack you physically
yes
he grabbed me by my hair
and forced me down on my knees
and
he put his
penis in your mouth
this is making me uncomfortable
want some water
thank you
he put his penis in my mouth
and said that he was going to
to fuck you were those his words
he said do you want to get fucked
and then he reached down
and tore off my panties
what did you do then
he threw me down on the scaffold
and i kneed him in the groin
and that was the end of it
its strange id think my instinct
would be to run but i became angry
i yelled at him called him names
told him id kill him
just yelling
how did he react
he seemed to realize what hed done
he pulled up his pants and left
did you call anyone afterwards
no
i didnt know what to do
i kept going over the day in my
mind trying to figure out
if somehow this thing was my fault
you reported it the next day
yes
but you didnt bring formal charges
why not
i talked to phil blackburn
i knew he was toms friend
i didnt want to destroy
toms marriage or career
but its clear we couldnt work together
i would be too scared
im scared just sitting here
nothing further
ms alvarez
ms johnson
i just want to be clear on one thing
mr sanders suggested
the bottle of wine
thats right
but you bought it
i sent my assistant mrs ross
out to buy a bottle
that afternoon
did you tell her what kind
i said to get a nice chardonnay
i knew tom liked white wine
from those trips to napa that
he was an amateur connoisseur
hed be impressed by a nice bottle
yes
do you remember the wine
no
the 91 pahlmeyer
thats right
do you know where your
assistant got that wine
i assume she got it at a liquor store
would it surprise you to know
that no liquor store in
seattle carries that bottle
mrs ross is very resourceful
very resourceful
a bottle of wine you cant find
within 500 miles of seattle
i have no idea where she
got the bottle of wine
isnt it true ms johnson
that you told mrs ross three weeks ago
that you wanted
a bottle of 91 pahlmeyer
for this meeting
thats not true
and when she couldnt find it you said
what was that
it had such managerial brio
here it is
if you dont find the wine
find a replacement
do you have testimony from mrs ross
yes i do
ms johnson
the fact is mrs ross
has personal problems
she has a drinking problem
she makes up stories to make
herself seem more important
i told mrs ross to go buy a bottle
of wine after tom and i spoke
at the luncheon
maybe she had that bottle at home
maybe in her wine cellar
any more questions
no not for now
i think this is a good time for a break
i got some information on meredith
you wont believe it or maybe you will
alan gave me a list
we cant verify any of this
you said you didnt have sex
i didnt
i didnt have sex with her
what is it tom
shes trying to quit smoking
its true
how could you do this
she did it thats the point
you saw this woman alone
you had wine a back rub you kissed
and then this nonsex sex thing
you took off her panties
those are facts
so what
that doesnt happen unless you want it
i was cornered
you let it happen
i did not
how could you how could you
let that woman into our lives
get this
ten of her subordinates transferred
in the last five years all men
what a red flag
can you see them
yeah but no one will talk and we cant
subpoena them just for a mediation
do you want to have lunch
i must go back to work
how about you are you hungry
how are you holding up
are you married
chandler hogue and alvarez
i married chandler
you married your boss
classic case of sexual harassment he
asked me out five times before i said yes
today if i had said no once
he would have been afraid to ask again
tom said youre a lawyer
ten years
lets switch hats what do you think
i dont look good in hats
youre afraid shes telling the truth
yes
what he did he did out of weakness
hardly makes it better does it
i cant get in the middle
of your relationship with tom
but she did break the law
and that makes the difference
ms alvarez 48 hrs ago my husbands
penis was in another womans mouth
theres nothing in the law
thatll help me deal with that
when did these arrive
came in an hour ago
garvin had me send the corridor
to the hotel for the conley people to use
its at the hotel
yeah the conley people had
such fun with it yesterday
getting anywhere with the drives
im counting on you
i have a hunch
what is it
i dont know
what is it
i dont know
she got to you didnt she
what else theyre stronger
theyre smarter and they dont fight fair
its the next step in the human evolution
keep some of us for sperm
and kill the rest
what do you have
if i know something for a fact
i wont withhold it
but i cant go out on a limb
its too intense around here
im 23 i cant wake up tomorrow and
find im out of the computer business
why arent you at the mediation
i just came back to this was
the last thing i needed this week
come in
somethings come up
i need to know exactly
what happened that night
well its exactly like i told phil
youre not talking to phil
we have sanders phone records
its possible someone overheard you two
john levin called again
find out what its about
he must talk to you personally
i dont want to talk to him now
can i talk to you
cindy
are you a friend
a friend
you know
a friend a friend
i depends on what you mean
by a friend
all right never mind
hes heading for the elevator
heading back to the mediation
yeah i must get back
ill give you a lift
dont you think its time we talked
i understand you both had
a chance to get it off your chest
your version of what happened
now i want it to stop
what i got off my chest
was not a version
its always a version
thats the legacy of the modern age
we have information but no truth
flashes of electrons in a grain of sand
im telling the truth
you must look at this from all sides
how many sides are there
all right lets say she made a mistake
so what
she made a pass thats all
you could have decided it was flattering
you could have handled it many ways
but this vindictiveness
l must say im surprised
its against the law
i work for her
im employed by her
no you work for me
thats what im saying
after all these years why didnt you
come to me not hire this lawyer
maybe i should have
i mean why cant you just forget it
work together like adults and
everyone makes a pile of money
whats wrong with that
its gone too far
things can go back
why would he offer to settle now
he realized how much they got to lose
no it doesnt add up
maybe theres a vulnerability
we dont know about
im still getting messages
from a friend i printed out the address
maybe you can check it out
i hope digicom doesnt find him first
remember the cleaning lady
shes out of town no one knows
where or when shes coming back
the bahamas probably
with mrs ross soon to join her
these guys play hardball
did mr sanders ever touch you in a way
that makes you feel uncomfortable
hes not aware of it
just answer the question please
yes
how
hell pat me on my behind or
rub my shoulders
rub your shoulders
i dont think he means anything by it
you dont like it
i just feel its inappropriate
i dont see the relevance of this
were trying to establish
a pattern of behavior
sexual harassers generally
follow a pattern
ill allow it
do you have chiropractic problems
any neck problems or your back
no
so you would characterize
this behavior as flirting
or sexual
i suppose so
but you never said anything
hes my boss
you didnt report it
hes your boss i understand
your job is at stake rumors
whether people would believe you
and if i ask you if you ever had any
sexual relations with mr sanders
same answer
no i didnt
didnt report it
it never happened
i understand
i have no more questions
barbara called
about the disneyland tickets for
jafar
hes got the tickets
and an upgrade at the hotel
thank you i appreciate it
they gave me your photos
ill see you later
yes ill see you later
you know
its funny how you always
assumed youd get the job
lewyn assumed it would be him or you
but nobody ever thought for a second
it might be me
isnt that funny
thats not true you were on the list
really
let me guess hunter
not someone youd follow into battle
a team player no killer instinct
doesnt have those tools
what is that all a code for
what you on merediths side
i studied engineering for eight years
i was the only woman in the department
you know what i did
i worked
you think im on merediths side
what do you want to do
what
their offer ends midnight its what
garvin said you get your job back
shes your boss
everyone goes back to work
did you find a friend
did we get the address
dr arthur friend a chemistry professor
from the university of washington
whos been in nepal
the last three weeks
you got messages from a locked office
im glad we got that one solved
shit i have to call lewyn
the drives were having
problems with came in
only you
anyone else would be sabotaging
the company not solving their problems
its adele and mark
were not home leave a message
and well call you back
what
marks wifes voice is on the machine
but on monday it was a mans voice
then the next day mark said
he never got the message
i dialed the wrong number that night
so
thats why the battery was dead
what are you talking about
thats why garvin wants to deal
hes got my phone records
ive got a ten minute phone bill
while im in merediths office
she took the phone away
i called the wrong number
but i never hung up the phone
the phone line is open
somebodys got this whole
thing on an answering machine
its levin not lewyn
whats going on
ive been getting phone calls
some creep has my visa
then at the office
everythings turned upside down
have they got the tape
what im saying is
its good i brought it home
my girlfriend and i listened to it
wheres the tape
its all here
ive been trying to get
a hold of you all week
you know what this means
do you have any idea what this means
thanks pal
no deal no no deal catherine
were going to bury them
everything is on tape
yes everything
put it in
god look at us
go inside me
i cant do this
do it
i wont
now come on now
you cant just stop you cant
no goddamn it
you stick your dick in my mouth
then get an attack of morality
this never happened
you never used to be this way
in any judicial proceeding
this tape would be inadmissible
im worried im going to drive to work
and hear it on howard stern
is she threatening
i dont know how many copies
of this tape there are
i didnt put it out there
this tape just shows consensual
sex between adults
however it may have
appeared the next day
mr sanders regret
is not my clients harassment
ms johnson
is that your position today
yes it is
ms alvarez
just so im clear on what todays story is
would you define for me
consensual sex
sex where both parties
are willing participants
how many times did we hear
mr sanders say no
i dont know i was busy listening
to my panties being torn off
31
31 times
doesnt no mean no
sometimes no means that person
wants to be overwhelmed dominated
the way were supposed to have sex
nowadays wed need un supervision
no means no
isnt that what we tell women
do men deserve less
when he really wanted to stop
he had no problems doing it
and you got angry
of course i did anyone would
we tell women they can stop at any point
havent you ever said
no and meant yes
until the moment of penetration
he was willing
that tape doesnt change anything
you controlled the meeting
you set the time you ordered the wine
you demanded service and got
angry when he didnt provide it
so you decided to get rid of him
with this trumpedup charge
the only thing you have proven
is that a woman in power
can be every bit as abusive as a man
you want to put me on trial
lets be honest about why
i am sexually aggressive i like it
tom knew it and you cant handle it
its the same thing since
the beginning of time
veil it hide it lock it up
and throw away the key
we expect a woman to do a mans
job make a mans money
then lie down for a man to fuck
her like it was 100 years ago
well no thank you
you wont believe this i think
the howard stern thing got to them
what did phil say
you get your job back
you get 100000 in pain and suffering
and i get fees and expenses
meredith
she stays through the merger
then they say
she has to leave for some
whatever emergency shes out
this is total and complete vindication
its over
i almost feel sorry for him
he has no idea does he
id like to read this over again before
we sign not that i dont trust you
just as long as its done
by midnight tonight
garvin wants this off his screen
we want you to make
a presentation on arcamax
at the merger announcement
tomorrow
nothing technical four minutes
fine
great
now ive got to go break it to her
it wont be easy
i thought you enjoyed
that kind of thing
you go after one of our people
well put the wagons in a circle
once you made your case
the company behaved appropriately
right
you dont want to know what i think
its terrible
way a thing like this can
tear a company apart
i told bob we really need
to take a look at it
friends
what
i hope you still think of me as a friend
good night phil
sign it now and ill read it later
where will you be
here working on the presentation
if not ill have somebody
run this by your house later
let me ask you something
whyd she do this
youve seen her in action
shes cool smart and in control
howd she lose control like this
i dont know
youre attractive maybe
but not irresistible
im serious shes here one day
theres a merger going on
conley people are touchy
she thought youd go along
theres more to it than that
come on
you think too much
you need to go home
open a nice bottle of champagne
make up with your wife
and get some sleep
its over
thank you
absolutely youre welcome
good night
good night
hi stephanie
must be difficult
nobody giving you information
its been a crazy week
i had a friend she was one
of the first women to move high up
you know what its like
every day putting out fires
it turned out the job
wasnt what she thought
she was looking the wrong
way when they fired her
interesting
truth usually is once you get to it
its you
where is everyone
mr garvin came in an hour ago
said they were working too hard
sent everyone home
what if sanders doesnt bring it up
he will
i talked to him about his
presentation on arcamax
he has no idea
when he brings up the line
you must pounce because we
dont have the harassment
it must be that sanders is incompetent
itll be in public with reporters
bobs counting on you
lets clean out the database
and any backup
catherine can you hold on one minute
has my contract gone out already
shit
what does it say about firing me
they can fire me for cause
cant they for incompetence
the problem with the drives is not
with the programming or the design
its with the production line
and thats my responsibility
this whole thing tomorrow
theyre setting me up
housekeeping please
this is mr conley
could someone come
and turn down my bed
my room number
its on the phone here somewhere
thats right
thank you very much
when does your dad arrive
midnight they stopped in houston
id love for him to get a chance

reduction of air handling capacity

and costeffective number 5
you cant put number 5 handlers in there
youll have dirt in everything
my god shes in the system

involving meredith
sooner or later tom will figure out
the changes at the plant
hes not stupid
tom will be out of the picture
by tuesday
i dont like to gamble
i love tahoe but i think the risk
think wholl believe him
hes married with a family
hell have no choice but to take
the settlement and leave
then we say sanders made the changes
at the plant hell deny it
he wont know
hell be gone by then
these things are so darn complicated
i think its upside down
there we go
whos first
must have left the system on
give it a try youll love it
id love to try it
i am totally screwed
ill make my presentation
meredith will ask me questions
shell make me look totally incompetent

cdrom drive in the world today
weve had our problems
but we are solving them
and were the problems with the design
no there are fabrication problems
involving the production line
what sort of problems
for example we should be using
automatic chip installers to lock
the control chip on
the malaysians have been
doing it by hand
jamming the chips in with their thumbs
and the quality of the air is dirty
we should use level 7 air handlers
were using level 5
and were ordering our components
like hinge rods and clips
not from our singapore supplier
but from someone whos a lot
cheaper but also less reliable
im confused you set up this line
you didnt anticipate these problems
the line was changed
the specifications were altered
how is that possible we know
you to be a competent manager
you should know
you ordered the changes
i dont know how you got that idea
you were in kuala lumpur last year
to settle a labor dispute
ive never even seen the line
you havent
no i dont know who told you i
youre watching malaysian channel 3
perhaps instead of digging up
malaysian video clips
we should discuss the problems here
the problems in your department
with the line you set up
all right
the first memo in the file being handed
out is signed by meredith johnson
it states that manual labor will
be used to install the chips
that made the malaysian
government happy
it also meant voltage irregularities
and memory allocation
the malay government
insisted we fill those jobs
the malaysian government does
not own shares of digicom
these people here do
the second memo
reduces the air handling
capacity in order to cut costs
and thats why were getting dirt in
the split optics the drive arms
the resulting delays will actually
increase the costs by more than 70
the third memo regarding
the drives are your responsibility
these problems were created
because of your incompetence
thats whats wrong
passing the buck
back stabbing
im not done
this socalled evidence of yours
is fooling no one
you can protect your turf
and think it means something
you werent told of these decisions
because theyre over your head
this merger is about synergy
between hardware and software
between cash flow and capital needs
thats a language you cant understand
i dont either
were buying this company
because they build things
you understand what she means
im trying to convey the sentiments
of everyone here
thats what i meant to do
could you step outside for a moment
can you build the darn thing or not
yes sir we can
theyre replacing meredith
garvins announcing it in ten minutes
ten minutes
im surprised you didnt come to gloat
gloating is underrated i actually
came here to pick up the arcamax files
some smart people underrated you
thank you
not including myself
i beat you i beat you fair and square
garvin lost his nerve
it was his brilliant idea
to fire you for incompetence
him and phil
now im being fired
ive never seen you play the victim
its the only good quality you had
im playing the game men set up
and im being punished for it
its fine
ive had calls from ten
headhunters with job offers
dont be surprised if im back
in ten years to buy this place
did it ever occur to you meredith
that maybe i set you up
this is my son spencer
how you doing
good
youre at the university of washington
thats great very good
what a week
the chinese say
may you live in interesting times
this merger is the most
interesting merger ive had
since my second marriage
the merger is complete
the question now is
who do we find to run things
up here in seattle
and what i realized during this
very interesting week
is that i have probably
focused too much on
breaking the glass ceiling
finding a woman to run things here
when i should have been
looking for the best person
to run things here
someone whose
long service with this company
has established a record
of creativity
sound judgement
and handson expertise
and that person
is stephanie kaplan
congratulations stephanie
i tell you something
shes the greatest
thank you
first id like to take the opportunity
to thank the department heads
mary anne hunter
and mark lewyn here
and don cherry where are you
there he is
and particularly tom sanders
who epitomizes the inventiveness
of this division
its past and its future
im counting on you to be my righthand
thank you
we are heading into a new millennium
a new time
you a chemistry major spencer
yeah i am
i know a chemistry professor there
arthur friend a friend
i dont know if he teaches freshmen
im his research assistant
so if arthur friend was in nepal
for example
youd have the keys to his
office and computer password
we all work so well together
