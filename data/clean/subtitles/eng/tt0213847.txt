heroically killed in action
in northern africa
and to his bride maddalena
who stricken with grief
unfortunately isnt here with us

because sicilian women
with their hardships
with their sacrifices
march shoulder to shoulder
with fighting men
of our fellow citizen in defense of his country was not a useless
lt cadei is so handsome
a lucky girl will catch him
that will carry us to the
final victory of the fascist empire
for victory

one day he was distracted
as he walked by
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one
dentist or not why havent

around with a shopkeeper in catania
with subversive tendencies
some say cusimano the dentist

my wife
officer look hes cheating on me
with a man
with a traitor
you said you wouldnt touch her
with a tenfoot pole
its the dentist
ive been spying on you
a long time you bastard
and as for you
go steal husbands from
your own village you whore
we knew she had one lover but two
but where does
the dentist fit in
he fits in between her legs
her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace
he never wants to see
his daughter malena again
and the dentists wife
kicked him out of his house
that dragon of a wife
will drag him into court
whats the dentist
got to do with it poor guy
malenas the whore
she should be taken to court
that lt cadei seemed
like such a gentleman
how could he get mixed up in this
everyone knows
shes a home wrecker
the lieutenant was asking for it
shes not from here she forgets where she is
will they go to court
of course she could go to jail
hes a married man
the dentist needed
three stitches in his head
but the dentist
swore at the soldier first
thats insulting an officer
well all end up in court
while we were
watching her caboose
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train
shes either going
to the lawyers or the notarys
sure but what will she do
with two old men like them
excuse me
come in
can i help you
may i speak to lawyer centorbi
please have a seat
sir its the widow scordia
can it be true
beautiful madonna
have her come in
go in
thank you
please sit down
charmed
we now continue with the testimony
of maddalena bonsignore
the widow scordia called malena
she could get two years in prison
everything will be fine trust me
sit down
youre accused of involving
dr gaspare cusimano
in a secret and
amorous relationship
aimed at the breaking up
of his family
do you know dr cusimano
yes
are you or have you ever
been his fiancee
absolutely not
how could i be engaged
to a married man
why was cusimano
at that unusual hour
on his way to your house
i dont know
had he been in your company
on previous evenings
yes once
where
at my house
jumped right in the dentist did
he looks stupid but
how long did he stay
not long
what did you do
he brought me some medicine
for my father
if it was for your father
why did he bring it to you
i dont know
what did you do after
he gave you the medicine
he said goodbye and left
then why has cusimano
are put able professional
who five years ago
had the honor of extracting
one of ii duces teeth
publicly declare
that he is your fiance
he made that up
i had nothing to do with it
your husbands crazy
what kind of relationship
did you have with lt cadei
im a widow my business
and that of lt cadei
are no concern of the law
all right
did you know that
as a result of these affairs
lt cadei was transferred to albania
one down
and before his departure
he was questioned in judicial inquiry
clerk
he declared to have encountered
the widow scordia only twice
in her home
and to have had
no amorous relationship
considering their relationship
just a casual friendship
son of a bitch
lt cadei was received by my client
and she makes no secret
about having had for him
certain feelings
but unlike the married cusimano
who was lets face it guilty
of a presenile dimming of the senses
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires
unlike the family man cusimano
but
cadei is
and was
a bachelor a bachelor
clever that lawyer
hes a bachelor himself
careful investigation
of the facts tell us therefore
that the scordia woman
committed no other crime
than that of being illfated
alone and beautiful
here is her crime her beauty
and from here the envy
the lies the disgrace
that have deprived her
even of a fathers trust
and yet she herself
is still in silent agony
mourning over
that unmarked war grave
in faraway east africa
in the beating heart of our argument
is an audacious
but nonetheless valid thesis
which asks just one question
can a young woman
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life
does she have the right
to yearn for and to write
a new ending to her own love story
your honor
the citizens
of castelcuto reply yes
will cusimano
leave me alone now
of course hes been put
into a psychiatric clinic
he wants to volunteer
for the forces in east africa
he doesnt realize
we lost africa ages ago
but lets forget cusimano
and the fickle lt cadei
lets get to us
i know its not much
but its all i have
theyve cut my pension
dont you understand
thats peanuts
my fee is much more than that
youll never have enough money
but how will i ever repay you
its very easy my sweet
what are you saying
be with me my love
im in love with you
a woman shouldnt be alone
during these hard times
i am a wealthy man
you wont find better
ill take care of your father
youll never have to worry again
i forgive her she did it
to pay her lawyers fees
only once and never again
but you didnt keep our agreement
now were even
signora malena
a more capable person than me
wrote that the only truelove
is unrequited love
now i understand why
its been so long since you
last came out of your house
but the longer we are apart
the stronger my love becomes
they say youre about to marry
centorbi the lawyer
i know how badly
they treat you here
how the women in the market
wont sell you any good food
and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife
but how will you manage to live
with a fat old man
so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him
they say he never washes
and stinks like a goat
how will your smooth white skin
bear rubbing against
the sweat of an old man
who never does anything
without his mothers consent
is it true youre getting married
what are you writing
give me that
let me see
get out
stand up straight
a little longer don placido
more room in the waist
for when he gets bigger
will they be ready tomorrow
the war has ruined
my business but it still takes time
as allied bombings continue
wait for me

bad things about her
but believe me your wife
malena was faithful to you

and asked if i will
