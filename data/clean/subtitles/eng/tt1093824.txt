werner herzog images taken ice ross sea antarctica
reason wanted go continent
pictures taken friend mine one expert divers
best connection military planes new zealand
loaded chaineddown parts polar stations
passengers tucked laptops books
many sleeping
people going meet antarctica end world
dreams
flew unknown seemingly endless void
surprised even plane
national science foundation invited antarctica
even though left doubt would come
another film penguins
questions nature let know different
told kept wondering
human beings put masks feathers conceal identity
saddle horses feel urge chase bad guy
hiyo silver
herzog certain species ants keep flocks plant lice slaves
milk droplets sugar
asked sophisticated animal like chimp
utilize inferior creatures
could straddle goat ride sunset
despite odd questions found landing ice runway mcmurdo
austral spring summer lasts october february
planes land foot thick ice ross sea
distance mountains transantarctic range
mcmurdo situated island
ross sea largest bay continent
bay alone covers size state texas
frozen ocean
early explorers ship got wedged moving ice flows
shackletons expedition evacuates vessel
would later come ruin leaving stranded
everything expedition doomed
including first ancestor snowmobile
idea big technical possibilities years ago
time every step meant incredible hardship
first thing caught eye upon landing
humongous bus driver
clearing apron thank man hey youre welcome
lvan terra bus one seven world
weighs pounds largest vehicle continent
herzog back home taxi driver
taxi driver home
came antarctica actually banker colorado
two years changed pace little bit
decided help people guatemala
joined peace corps worked small business development
realized worlds money
rowland lived guatemala northern part
kekchi mayan village mayan therefore nobody spoke spanish
learn mayan dialect kekchi
first moved chisec normal walk knew
six people machetes chasing wanting talk
turns little brother told steal children
however steal children
took back judge jury yearold boy town
could speak spanish kekchi
luckily let go
ended great friends two years
herzog jury acquitted acquitted made
could dangerous
know story long ago
lady taking picture child
know type group people machetes wasnt fortunate
didnt make happened
killed machete
herzog approaching mcmurdo station largest american base
fact largest settlement antarctica
right captain scotts hut built
herzog austral summer
people live experiencing strange state
five months nighttime
mcmurdo serves logistical hub
provides fixed laboratory facilities research
decisions scientific projects
domain host national science foundation
day day logistics run defense contractor
told disgruntled former inhabitants
ran things spirit correctional facility
actually decent people concerned personal safety
course expect pristine landscapes
men living blissful harmony fluffy penguins
still surprised find mcmurdo looking like ugly mining town
filled caterpillars noisy construction sites
people drive heavy machinery
brought antarctica
laughing long story ive explored many different
lands mind many worlds ideas
started even knew read write
grandmother reading odyssey iliad
started journey fantasy
even knew means
accomplishing mind psyche ready
already traveling odysseus argonauts
strange amazing lands always stayed
fascination world fell love world
powerful whole time
herzog happen encountering
end world
think logical place find place works
almost natural selection people
intention jump margin map
meet lines map converge
pasho v point south south pole
think fair amount population
fulltime travelers parttime workers
yes professional dreamers
dream time think
great cosmic dreams come fruition
universe dreams dreams
think
many different ways reality
bring forward dreaming definitely one ways
herzog banal mcmurdo appears
turns filled professional dreamers
night laying bed mcmurdo
walking across top b
might well piece south pole
yet im actually adrift ocean
vagabond floating ocean feet
feel rumble iceberg
feel change cry iceberg
screeching bouncing seabed
steering ocean currents beginning move north
feel sound coming bottoms feet
telling iceberg coming north thats dream
im sitting lovely warm lab outside environment
scott shackleton first faced came years ago
unlike scott shackleton viewed ice sort static monster
crossed get south pole
scientists able see ice dynamic living entity
sort producing change like icebergs study
wild ride
first found iceberg came study
larger iceberg sank titanic
larger titanic
larger country built titanic
thats pretty big
b see white cliff feet tall
means theres feet ice water line
iceberg big water contains
would run flow river jordan years
big water inside would run river nile years
macayeal little bit video shot
flying iceberg
looks big looms us even aircraft
flying iceberg iceberg always us
us mystery dont understand
heres picture looked like arrived center iceberg
put instruments
gon na opportunity monitor iceberg drifts north
theyre big theres element fear
dont know really whats going come ahead
eventually begin melt ocean beyond antarctica
seeing timelapse sort animation
satellite imagery sea ice continent antarctica
see three shades gray
sort lighter shade gray sea ice
little bits pieces titanic icebergs
little fellow right hes big iceberg compared ones
guy might size island sicily mediterranean
like little tiny bumblebee zipping around circle
happy warm waters drifting north
id happy see antarctica static monolithic environment
cold monolith ice sort way people back past used see
comfortable thought antarctica
seeing living thats dynamic
thats producing change change broadcasting rest world
possibly response world broadcasting antarctica
certainly gut level going frightening
watch happens babies get north
herzog environment would men shackletons expedition encounter
returned next life
shackleton seen would finally make pole
quest abandon mere miles short
would ice left
would construct artificial antarctica studio
try find route papiermache icebergs
would modern recourse create ice machines
frosty boy mcmurdo
equivalent ice cream states really big hit
everybody loves go three four times day
texture ice cream quite ice cream
theres lot crises happen mcmurdo frosty boy runs
bad news
words circulate everywhere throughout mcmurdo frosty boy goes
really good stuff
herzog first day wanted get place
mcmurdo climatecontrolled housing facilities radio station
bowling alley abominations aerobic studio yoga classes
even atm machine
reasons wanted get field soon possible
could mandatory every inhabitant mcmurdo
attend survival school allowed leave
twoday exercise called happy camper
students learn build survival trenches igloos
bad news night sleep construction
long end fingers toes end good
oh god sorry
need break two different groups
gon na brief group burning vehicle scenario first
gon na come back gon na brief
bucket head whiteout scenario everybody else
essentially trying create conditions wouldnt able see
wind severe snow blowing severely cold
exposed skin might actually create frostbite instantaneously
winds severe could blown stance
simply standing visibility pretty much none
cant see flag flag
might able see hand front face
therefore gon na simulator
incorporate bucket simulate whiteout condition
point barely hear
cant necessarily even hear certainly cant see right
thats whole idea behind bucket head
actually whiteout simulator works really quite well
parameters gon na
gon na start inside seaice hut
said gon na go bathroom fact
needed go bathroom right ive gone
ive gone quite time though
know like sudden minutes youre like
first wheres chocolate second wheres kevin
emery us number one number one
herzog goal clear find instructor next outhouse
number two
number three number three
emery right number one youre gon na walk one simple direction
im gon na keep pull one rope
four
herzog looks pretty good seem heading right direction
five
six
soon front man veers offcourse pulling everyone else
pull rope somebody three hey anybody
number three
number two find
find guy
one okay think gon na go way
follow way guys way guys
hold hold
part want educational opportunity
see realize theyve done
come back hut come new game plan
keep going cascading error phenomenon
one mistake leads another mistake
leads third gets really bad
whos pulling line
number one
number one dont pull thats line going back hut
got end okay back hut
back hut back hut
back hut
herzog rather pulling everyone
last man first along rope
drift completely offcourse
number two number three number three
number four
towards sun towards sun
left need go left
left stay left
dont know hes standing though left might different
correct number two
okay number one im
herzog time postcardpretty weather conditions
frustrating loathe sun celluloid skin
almost came relief days later weather suddenly changed
storm soon broke allowed venture mcmurdo first time
set snowmobiles front us miles miles frozen ocean
heading toward field camp scientists study seals
amazing consider
mere six feet us expanse ross sea
scientists particularly interested
feeding cycle weddell seal
short weeks
pups grow rapidly mothers lose body weight
bagging seals head keeps animal calm scientists extract milk sample
seal wailing
oftedal well really quite wonderful group animals work
weddell seals particular see theyre big
theyre strong yet allow us work
theyre aggressive timid
even though struggle somewhat bag net
release lie
theres mother behind us worked
shes lying quietly pup
weve pups start nurse within couple minutes releasing
even though bit perturbed handled
recover quickly seem behave normally
really thats ideal us animal species work
disturbed work thats done
behave abnormally
cause want know animals survive conditions
herzog field laboratory adjacent colony
prepare milk samples
may ultimately provide insight human weight loss
collected still warm animal see
see like know almost like pouring wax
really something else let cool would get pretty pasty
wouldnt able pour like body temperature right
milk weddell seal fat
dry matter dry matter
high protein
protein contains lactose
unusual
theres many things place unusual
one things find fascinating quiet gets
quietest place
wind theres wind
wakes middle night theres wind
theres sound
walk ice hear heartbeat
thats still
hear hear ice crack
sounds like theres somebody walking behind ice
sort know little stress cracks moving time
actually right ocean
solid ground hear seals
hear seals call amazing sound
make really inorganic sounds
seal calling
sound like dont know pink floyd something
dont sound like mammals definitely dont sound like animals
really world say
oftedal get used surface solid
sort think mind youre land sudden
youll hear sound coming floor
youll hear chucks whistles booms
booms come
realize theres whole world underneath
seals moving competing fighting beneath ice
youre sleeping tent working lab hut
seals calling
herzog soon returned prosaic world todays mcmurdo
david pacheco works maintenance construction journeyman plumber
prides heritage
part apache claims yet another lineage
funny im revealing hands distinct
told doctor operated
aztec incas royal family
anthropologist told one daughters similar
everywhere go try find somebody see
turn around wan na see way
distinct line
awe told royal family indians
herzog work fingers work best point best
dont know say funny
school used reach chalkboard
used point called father
said bad boy
still habit pointing like
long ribcage could find gallbladder
long ribcage like aztecs used guess
come antarctica please plus aware global warming real
im green person im green build adobe homes solar homes
im contractor back home hard small minority make
speaking spanish
spirit fire ancestors
whoops
whistles
herzog next journey took us kilometers frozen ocean
heading ross island direction mainland antarctica
empty interior beyond mountains
larger size continental north america
vast majority covered layer ice feet thick
heading new harbor
diving camp lies coastline ocean
right frozen sea dive
camp built firm ground
welcomed friend henry kaiser musician expert diver
whose underwater footage brought place
arrived opportune time went straight shelter
protects primary diving hole next new harbor camp
sam bowser head scientific field team
found pensive mood
herzog sam bowser special day
well think
think everyone stop theyve reached point
theyve done theyve wanted
today probably gon na last antarctic dive think
think weve accomplished
least ive accomplished ive set
time pass ball next generation biologists think
bit special day
herzog heard also great science fiction fan
creatures like sciencefiction creatures
range way would gobble slimetype blobs
creepier classic sciencefiction blobs
would long tendrils would ensnare
tried get away
youd become ensnared actions
would frustrated exhausted
creature would start move take apart
thats one example one creatures
types wormtype things horrible mandibles
jaws bits rend flesh
really violent horribly violent world
obscure us encased neoprene
know much larger world
doesnt really affect us shrink
miniaturize world itd horrible place horrible
herzog world earlier human beings
think human race mammals
fled panic oceans crawled solid land get
yeah think undoubtedly thats exactly driving force
caused us leave horrors behind
grow evolve larger creatures escape
whats horribly violent miniature scale miniaturized scale
yeah
herzog water ice minus degrees celsius
keeps us insulated cold
want open
yeah ready yeah
dive operation time right
ill give call back
divers look like astronauts floating space
work extremely dangerous
diving without tethers give free range
cant trust compass
close magnetic pole needle would point straight straight
somehow find way back exit hole
trapped ceiling ice
selected areas tree foraminifera
theyre ones interested right find theyre carnivores
whether eat shrimplike creatures multicellular creatures
also found urchins think
theyre ones parasitic worm lives anus
pretty beautiful scarlet worm
must horrible way make life would think
announcer tv tell gentlemen science agreed
unless something done done quickly
man dominant species life earth extinct within year
herzog sam bowser likes show
doomsday science fiction films researchers
many express grave doubts longranging presence planet
nature predict regulate us
announcer stay homes repeat stay homes
personal safety safety entire city
depends upon full cooperation military authorities
yes cities nations even civilization threatened annihilation
one moment historymaking violence
nature mad rampant wrought awesome creation
born swirling inferno radioactive dust
things horrible terrifying hideous
word describe
may witnesses biblical prophecy come true
shall destruction darkness come upon creation
beasts shall reign earth
announcer yes earth infested swarms
bowser flower part body somewhere dirt
herzog divers brought back ocean floor
spoonfuls sand containing strange singlecelled creatures
scientists studying
known tree foraminifera primordial singlecelled organisms
branch shape trees
branches give pseudopodia microscopic false feet
gather assemble grains sand protective shell around twigs
bowser pseudopodia secreted foraminifera
theyre long thin tendrillike projections
foram wakes
sends pseudopods grabs every particle environment
pulls toward body
theres certain pattern way sort particles
select particular grains everything environment
end theyre beautiful masons
herzog could early appearance intelligence
say great care yeah say great care
stories
particular organisms fit debate
turn last century example
scientist british scientist named heronallen
apparently one debates
one british societies
pointing fact every definition intelligence
formulated could fulfilled singlecelled creatures
borderline intelligence yeah singlecelled level
mean manifestation best abilities really
way build shells almost art
drilling
herzog noticed divers routine speaking
like priests preparing mass
ice divers find separate reality
space time acquire strange new dimension
experienced world frozen sky
often speak going cathedral
herzog back strange world underwater scientists study samples
one foremost scholars world field dr pawlowski
studies dna sequences foraminifera
looks esoteric fact one fundamental questions life earth
way cosmologists search origins universe
scientists tracing back evolution life earliest stages
sometimes building blocks sequences seem fit
jan found today far sample found
three new species three new species
three new species dish thats fantastic
romeo site yeah romeo site
one small silver two elongated ones dont know
dna dont know
herzog great moment
yeah yeah yeah time increase
known diversity types creatures pretty exciting
yeah special
bowser playing guitar
apologies rock musicians everywhere
laughing
herzog importance discovery sunk
sam bowser group plan celebrate event way
guitars playing
rehearsing latenight outdoor concert
playing rock music
helicopter dropped us back mcmurdo
nobody around sundial showed close
feel like night look around
unobtrusive building raised curiosity quite
amongst unripe tomatoes ran young man
end place
oh yeah well know like say
take everybody whos tied sort
fall bottom planet
know havent thats got know
loose ends together
remember first got sort
enjoyed sensation recognizing people tribal markings
know like hey people
phds washing dishes know linguists continent languages
sort thing yeah great
yeah specifically graduate program lined
work one people
identified native speaker competent native speaker
one languages winnebago people hochunk
think pronounced
herzog make complicated story short
ran new age ideologues made insipid claims black white magic
embedded grammar language
oral tradition passed along
hence stupid trend academia
would better let language die preserve
know could document language
destroy entire phd research
imagine know
languages extinct probably lifetime
catastrophic impact
ecosystem talk kind extinction
culturally talking thing mean
know lost
russian literature something like russian know took
slavic languages went away know tolstoy
occurred time spent greenhouse
possibly three four languages died
efforts preserve endangered species
seem overlook something equally important
sign deeply disturbed civilization
tree huggers whale huggers weirdness acceptable
one embraces last speakers language
mcmurdo full characters like linguist
bleak motel drabness corridors misleading
behind every door someone special story tell
jo yce back took garbage truck across africa london nairobi
trip four months garbage truck horrible
numerous occasions came pretty close dont know dying
pretty close straits
didnt know gon na get back know
got taken military uganda
kidnapped basically truck turned around
going back entebbe got one
trying wait ferry wadi halfa
one blew people died
well didnt get one took across desert
got stuck got stuck five days
absolute agony clawing truck using plates
dinner plates using dinner clawing tires
water used water tanks gasoline
basically cup water day two cups
herzog story goes forever
dealt bout malaria
herd angry elephants pursuing tsetse flyinvested swamps
got caught civil war spent night bombedout airport
rebels fighting shooting barroom brawl
finally rescued drunk russian pilots
slaloming around crater holes runway
get place antarctica
herzog socalled freak train event one mcmurdos bars
karen surprisingly one popular performers
famous travel hand luggage act
woman yeah take home
cheering
thought another one yeah
traveled ecuador lima peru sewer pipe
laughs forgot mention hitchhiked denver bolivia
back got ride truck
flatbed truck three huge sewer pipes back spent days
back truck sewer pipe watching world go like
thats could see
herzog travel deprived freedom means even
ones youll find antarctica
libor zicha works utility mechanic
lived like prisoner behind iron curtain
herzog escaped big drama
oh wasnt drama
tragic events surrounding escape haunt day

talk okay thank
best description hunger description bread
poet said think
best description freedom front
traveling lot
thats right yeah show us
thats freedom glad show
herzog keeps rucksack packed ready go times
inside everything needs set moments notice
sleeping bag tent clothes cooking utensils
much weight
usually dont go kilos thats limit
limit also airlines
contents backpack quite surprising
thats size raft
quickly leave oh always ready
bag always prepared always ready adventure
exploring new horizons
herzog back days amundsen scott shackleton
scientific exploration antarctica began
opening unknown continent great achievement
one thing early explorers feel right
obsession first one set foot south pole
personal fame glory british empire
shackletons original hut preserved unchanged years
way south pole onwards
expansion possible
empire started fade abyss history
looks like extinct supermarket
cultural level meant end adventure
exposing last unknown spots earth irreversible
feels sad south pole mount everest
left peace dignity
may futile wish keep white spots maps
human adventure original sense lost meaning
became issue guinness book world records
scott amundsen clearly early protagonists
degenerated absurd quests
frenchman crossed sahara desert car set reverse gear
waiting first barefoot runner summit everest
first one hopping south pole pogo stick
furman well idea breaking guinness record every continent
antarctica would sixth
im trying think way get antarctica
ashrita furman want travel way
already holds guinness record discipline
also one
decided upon prosaic approach took airplane
flew antarctica
anyway thrilling im antarctica
im trying break guinness record
antarctica like moon
mean peaceful pure
desolate mean great place
herzog antarctica moon even though sometimes feels like
yet planet
mcmurdo comes closest future space settlement would look like
penguins cawing
left mcmurdo penguin colony cape royds
everyone spoke penguins
however questions easily answered
referred penguin expert
studied almost years
told taciturn man
solitude much conversation humans anymore
dr ainley gave best effort
well cape royds
th anniversary
first penguin study ever done
done cape royds
person part shackleton expedition
good winter theyre fat
theyve
claimed territories eggs laid females left
theres males sitting eggs
using fat reserves waiting females return
relieve go sea
tried keep conversation going
dr ainley read somewhere gay penguins
observations
ive never
strange sexual behavior talk
yeah ive seen triangular relationships theres
one female two males female lays egg
eggs males female trade season
misidentities initially sex penguins
somebody recently described call prostitution
female collecting rocks nest
course penguins
way collect rocks steal others
order submissive
order get close male whos maybe advertising mate
shell come sit nest sometimes theyll copulate
really idea get rock
soon escapes rock
dr ainley thing insanity among penguins
try avoid definition insanity derangement
dont mean penguin might believe lenin
napoleon bonaparte could go crazy
theyve enough colony
well ive never seen penguin bashing head rock
get disoriented
end places shouldnt long way ocean
herzog penguins heading open water right
one caught eye one center
would neither go towards feeding grounds edge ice
return colony
shortly afterwards saw heading straight towards mountains
kilometers away
dr ainley explained even caught
brought back colony
would immediately head right back mountains

one disoriented deranged penguins
showed new harbor diving camp
already kilometers away
rules humans disturb hold penguin
stand still let go way
hes heading interior vast continent
kilometers ahead hes heading towards certain death
last field camp visited mount erebus
active volcano feet high
particular importance inside crater magma inner earth
directly exposed
two volcanoes world
one congo ethiopia
political strife places
actually easier conduct field studies antarctica
first thing instructed etiquette dealing volcano
one important thing keep mind youre crater
lava lake could explode time
vital keep attention faced toward lava lake
watch bombs tracking air
try pick ones might coming toward step way
last thing wan na turn away crater run crouch
keep attention toward lava lake look move way
herzog fortunate lava lake enshrouded mist day
new observation camera
william mclntosh leader team volcanologists
camera designed prison riots explosion proof
coated thick teflon housing
heres lens camera
camera inside made small company canada extreme cctv
inside housing specifically designed explosion
explosion
explosionproof
theres bang lava lake right bombs though
herzog magma lake filmed years ago
time bold attempt descend crater
halfway plateau
gaping hole straight magma
near disaster
magma exploded striking one climbers got away minor injuries
today lava monitored dr mclntoshs camera
dr clive oppenheimer true englishman cambridge university
surprised us tweed outfit wears tribute explorers old
analyzes gas emissions volcanoes world
one active volcanoes indonesia
id far circumspect standing crater rim
benign form volcanism
even eruptions weve seen historic period relatively minor affairs
go back geological record
see huge
volcanic eruptions massive explosive eruptions produced
thousands cubic miles pumice
showering large parts earth fine ash
demonstrated strong impact climate
one biggest events years ago
argued even affected human ancestors
may played important role
origins dispersal early humans
events recur think understand
better prepare eventuality
herzog many reasons presence planet
seem sustainable
technological civilization makes us particularly vulnerable
talk scientific community climate change
many agree end human life earth assured
human life part endless chain catastrophes
demise dinosaurs one events
seem next
gone happen thousands years future
alien archeologists another planet
trying find south pole
descend tunnels dug deep pole
still minus degrees thats place outlived
large cities world
walk

wanted leave one remnant presence planet
would find frozen sturgeon mysteriously hidden away
beneath mathematically precise true south pole
stash back away frozen shrine another eternity
find memories world green
human race wanted preserve least lost beauty earth
left framed garland frozen popcorn
back base camp mount erebus
due considerable altitude
volcanologists need medical care
soon find back work
face frozen
quite cold today
fantastic lava lake energy
still bring old petrol generators crater rim
man versus machine chapter professor clive oppenheimer erebus
hands pockets waiting start spontaneously
could waiting long time
ever seen two men kiss top erebus
laughing
oppenheimer pushing back frontiers
r okay
like working harry
herzog along slopes volcano
vents steam creates socalled fumaroles bizarre chimneys ice
sometimes reaching two stories height
possible descend
careful avoid ones containing toxic gasses
foot erebus sea ice
two tallest buildings continent located
hangars scientific payloads readied
balloon launch stratosphere
interested neutrino detection project
scientists planning lift observation instrument
kilometers stratosphere
search almost undetectable subatomic particles
cheering
rises smalliooking bubble helium expand
fill entire skin still looks like white rope
eventually form gigantic globe feet diameter
reaches stratosphere
detector scan thousands square miles ice
without encountering electrical disturbances inhabited world
prior launch inside hangar
neutrino project led dr gorham university hawaii
trying instrument first
scientific group detect highest energy neutrinos universe hope
herzog yeah dr gorham exactly neutrino
neutrino ridiculous particle could imagine
billion neutrinos went nose talking
trillion trillion went nose
nothing
pass matter around us continuously
huge huge blast particles nothing
theyre like almost exist separate universe
know physicists measure
make precision predictions measurements exist
cant get hands
seem exist another place
yet without neutrinos beginning universe would worked
would matter today
couldnt create elements without neutrinos
earliest seconds big bang
neutrinos dominant particle actually determined
much kinetics production elements know
universe cant exist way without neutrinos
seem separate universe
trying actually make contact
otherworldly universe neutrinos
physicist even though
understand mathematically understand intellectually
still hits gut
something around
surrounding almost like kind spirit god
cant touch
measure
make measurement
like measuring spirit world something like
go touch things
herzog surprisingly found incantation hawaiian language
side detector
spirits invoked
would see could film impact neutrino
would see would see lightning bolt meters long
thick
would blast speed light meter distance
would see beautiful blue light eyes ever seen
happens
entire impulse radio waves
probably
one onehundred billionth second
goes bang gone thats looking
beautiful saying american
philosopher alan watts used say eyes
universe perceiving
ears universe listening cosmic harmonies
witness universe
becomes conscious glory magnificence
