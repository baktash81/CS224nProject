completely naked right outside the office
and he says ronny told me to show up
hey i have a question for the table
how long does it take to really know someone
i think youre continually
getting to know someone
cause i think people change when they grow
but i do think if you go through hell with someone
then you get a pretty good sense
of how they handle stuff
which is important
come on were on the other side of that one
i dont know
i think you can know someone within
the first 10 seconds of seeing them
i mean i fell in love with geneva the second i saw her
aw
its true i did
well i dont know if you ever
really know someone entirely
and what is that supposed to mean yeah
well i mean you know someone
you think pretty good
and then you find out stuff thats shocking
that you didnt know existed
i think that happens every day
look at that show 2020 its always
the same thing right
theyre a couple theyre happy
no one could believe it
there are a lot of these cases
what about the guy with the crossbow
he buys a crossbow hes practicing in the garage
by the way bring me some lemonade
oh my goodness i had no idea you walked
through at that moment oops
continue please continue
that is gross
but she forgives him it was an
accident and guess what
six months later same accident yes and it kills her
no yes
no
and look it you hear all the time about these families
that have entirely other families
the dad who knows what he does for a living
he leaves to go to connecticut
but he was never going to connecticut on business
hes really going to harlem hes
got a puerto rican family
that no one ever heard about yeah
you think when hes watching the game instead
of pretzels hes eating goya beans
red flags but they dont catch it
so my point is you can really
think you know somebody
and then it turns out that you dont
know everything about somebody
all right ronny you still havent
answered the question
no i just did you didnt
no you didnt answer it youre skirting it
youre not answering straight up come on
youre bouncing around youre doing
this hey when youre doing this
you do that a lot by the way
i think youre all special peoples
youre out of your mind
and youre nothing of the sort
this is our shot i need you to hug him
i dont want to hug him
look it ever since he had a neardeath experience
hes become a very touchyfeely
guy and he likes to be held
look you know i dont like touching
people i dont know very well okay
or even people i do so just
nick do you want this thing or not
of course i do
then feed the beast here
this guy has a hot button a point
of interest his hot button is hugs
you hug him youre gonna crack him wide open
hes going to start feeling all bubbly inside
then he starts writing checks
all right
im not asking you to go to an airport motel
and perform a trick on a japanese businessman
im asking you to hug a senior executive
from general motors thats all
now get your arms around him
and make him feel bubbly and warm
ill tell you what

final approach to detroits metro airport

great moments are born from great opportunity

thats what youve earned here today
one meeting okay what are you doing
youre giving me the really
the kurt russell speech from the movie miracle
i just saw that fiveyearold kid do
it on youtube the other night
and i thought it was really inspirational
its applicable to what were doing
any time you go into a pressure situation
a competition it makes sense
and im not gonna write something better than that
look at you youre nervous
youre never nervous now youre nervous
okay heres the thing i cant be
broke if im gonna get married
yeah
yes see i knew you would get here
okay so heres my plan
im gonna ask her next month on her birthday

deal from this hasidic guy
who i met during gamblers anonymous
hes literally gonna give me a 20000 ring
for 10000 can you believe that
how are you doing that
well im gonna give him cash
and then i also said that you would help fix his car
so those two little things are gonna
get me the deal with the hasidic
oh im helping im helping fix the car
well youre the one who kept telling me to dive into it
i thought youd be excited to help im sorry
okay fine but that is my gift to you
honestly therell be no fruit bowl from the registry
thats it thats what youre looking at
you dont have to make a decision now
on the day see whats right
no im making i can make the
decision now im making it now
im telling you right now that is my gift
thats it im fixing the car with the hasidic guy
and make sure you tell beth that too
seriously i dont want it to be
uncomfortable let her know
whatever you wanna do on that day is your choice
okay im doing it
you take this meeting 10 times
you might not get it nine
all right you got to stop that now
but not this meeting nick
not today
youre really making me nervous
today we are the greatest small business in the world
im sick and tired of hearing about how
innovative these other boutiques are
this is our time their time is done
were showing up in a cab
thanks for not mentioning that my
last three prototype bids got rejected
thats just a bad streak pal
youre gonna be great i promise you
here you go
ladies and gentlemen electric cars
theyre totally gay
its true
i dont mean that theyre homosexual gay
but i do mean your parents were the
chaperone at the dance gay right
you tuck it in and wear it real high gay
i dont wanna disrespect anybody
cause im not about that
but i think were understanding
what were trying to talk about here right
i mean honestly the nissan spit really
it screams this
oh here we go
the hyundai pomegranate right
the chevy fingerprint
now
ah look at this
the 1966 ford gt350
you wanna roll up in that one hoss
the 1965 pontiac gto
completely awesome
the 1970 hemi cuda
took more virginities than francis albert sinatra
what are we suggesting here
were talking about taking the benefits
of electric transportation
but combine them with the rock and rollness
and the sexiness that the dodge
current musclecar models have
nicholas
we believe we could produce the technology
to incorporate an electronic motor
in your current models
but with the aggressive sound character
the exhilarating vibration character
the complete visceral experience
that weve all grown to know and love in
the dodge challenger and charger lines
guys we love our current electric models
that said we also agree theres a
market for what youre pitching
but if youre asking dodge to invest
in your pursuit of this concept
what do you have that we dont
nick brannen
so lets forget the upfront money
lets deal with it in success because thats
exactly what were gonna have
i want 900000 you want 400000
we dont need to get a chinese auction where
i go 850 you go 450 right
eight five
lets just cut it right down the middle
at 775 and close this thing
i appreciate your spirit mr valentine
but were taking all the risk
so well stick with the 400000
and i think you need to focus
on the bigger picture here
with success and a good working relationship
were prepared to offer you an overall
deal which means upfront money
and an option for an exclusive longterm
contract with your company
and with that deal you gentlemen
wont be disappointed
you made a great decision today tom
thank you thank you
youll be under the supervision of susan warner here
shes from the outside but weve
had great experience with her
you know i was at ford
until about five months ago
theyre still talking about you guys over there
they said you could whittle down a supplier
to less than 15 cents on the dollar just by talking
and you were like a mad scientist that
wouldnt leave the lab for days
well boys
it takes one to know one
im one of you
im a visionary im a maverick
im a gunslinger just like you
and this idea of yours this vision
im inspired by what yall throwing down
i got some serious lady wood here
i want to have sex with your words
i want to bang your brain
oh i got to go im late for mommy
and me ill call you
bye okay

ronny i got to tell you

to have a panic attack
what if i cant deliver i mean we
sank every cent we have into this

i think youre taking this all in a little
too fast just a little too soon
now you said it yourself
were on the fiveyard line we just got to punch it in
twentyfive what
i said we were on the 25yard line
nick are you suggesting that were
not even in the red zone
oh man what if i cant do it
everybody just think dodge is gonna
know theyre gonna laugh at us
that guy that security guard hes just laughing
look at him hes just staring hold on
look at the security guard hes looking at me
okay stop get it together stop looking at me
just take a breath for a second
dont lose perspective here
youre only five yards from the red zone
now once we get in the red zone were a mortal lock
youre a redzone guy
still 25 yards out do you understand that
by the way i dont care how you spin
it how you want to ice the cake

and im having trouble breathing now
you need to relax
everything is going to be fine
i never said we were in the red zone
so its been 10 days since the meeting

i was walking on clark
because i had to go these kids lost their ball
and i had to go in the bushes and get their ball
why couldnt they get their own ball
well you know how these kids are
today theyre so damn lazy
i mean with all the gaming and
texting and happy meals
i mean childhood obesity is completely out of control
you know that beth
and these kids were just overly huffing
and puffing and they were sweating
all right well i dont see why that means
they cant go get their own ball
well to their credit these little porkers were trying
but they couldnt reach the ball
this little alligatorarmed kid was in there doing it
but the little kid he cant get the ball
so then i come walking up
and they say hey can you
help me with the ball here
so i say okay im running late
but these kids want to play ball and
frankly im a supporter of it
now that were all gonna be on the
same damn healthcare too
im paying for these fat kids
boom i drop to the ground
so now im reaching in here like this
trying to get the ball see
but i dont want this branch to hit me here
right im doing it you see what i mean honey
and i got to dig in more under the
branch but hold the branch
but then my right hands going here
see thats why i got this bitch right here
oh thats a direct contact
and i get the ball now i get it
i got the ball out okay here
gave the ball back to the kids
then i started to head home right
and then thats when i noticed
that my arm was really itching
and i thought that it was because
i rubbed up against the brush
why are you carrying so much cash ronny
well i was on my way to the suppliers
before i helped the fat kids with the ball
but boy thank goodness
it fell out here thats great
because could you imagine if it
wouldve fallen out there wow
yeah thats a lot of cash
well you know my suppliers deal in cash
but do you mind if i dont dial
into all the details right now
im just starting to really itch
so id rather just go and take care of this real quick

nick what is it ron what do you want
i want to talk to you about something
thats kind of personal
something that doesnt have to do with any of this
do you mind just stepping up with
me in the office real quick
you want to go to the office talk
about something personal
that doesnt have to do with this
yeah
you know im bleeding inside
theres blood where it shouldnt be in
my body out of things
ive thrown up four times in the last two days
which doesnt make any sense because
i havent eaten in three
so i dont even know where its coming from
hey listen i understand what youre saying
youre not in the pressure cooker man youre not
when i said i was on the 25yard line im not
im much further back than that
we are deep in our own end zone
right back there yeah
and im flushed out of the pocket
and the defense is coming for me
and theyre big man theyre fast
ah theyre coming and i turn
to you my lead blocker
you turn to me hey
you want to go upstairs and talk in the
office about something personal
just block
thats what i need you to do is just block

sign the damn loan forms
so i have somebody to fund my failure
unless you just want to kiss that
longterm contract goodbye
unbelievable huh
the bulls i know its ridiculous
i mean rose shouldve passed to noah
he was wide open completely unguarded
i know man they just cant get it together at all
yeah i mean if you ask me rose doesnt trust noah
theyre teammates he doesnt trust
he can hit the winning shot
sucks man
yeah because trust really runs deep on a team
you got to be able to trust your teammate
do you think that you have to be able to trust
your teammate off the court as well
uh sure lets just say
and im talking completely hypothetically here
lets say that noah finds out that
derek roses girl is cheating
does he tell him or not
because he doesnt want to affect his performance
yeah i mean hes no no
yeah you tell him no
its toxic to keep all that in you have to tell him
thats guy code youre talking about your best friend
you ever hear the expression kill
the messenger cause i mean
yeah but i dont think it applies here at all
i mean if you dont tell your friend your best friend
then youre basically banging her too
okay come on now it depends is it the playoffs
game seven the championship
championship

dont tell him nope you wait you wait

nick goes to pilsen to a massage parlor
where he gets wanked by a
19yearold vietnamese girl
who speaks four words of english how about that
i dont believe a word youre
saying right now
yeah youre just covering your ass
listen to me
nick is my very best friend
in the entire world i know
and i am never ever ever going
to keep this from him
do you understand so im coming to you now
and im giving you an opportunity
but you need to deal with this
but it only happened because my husband
wasnt intimate with me im not a marriage counselor
i dont want to be a marriage counselor
lets make it really really simple then
either you tell him or i will
i cant
i will
no no ronny no yes
no ronny no dont do this now
not while this chrysler thing is going on
listen nick is not sleeping at night
his stomach is literally bleeding
this would destroy him
youre not going to see this guy anymore
no god no that was stupid i know that was stupid
and its over its over because it never was
then why have you been texting him all night
have i yeah you have
sitting on the blackberry
banging people
your sister just bought a new dress
just like i was saying ronny you dont know shit
are you promising me
that as soon as this bit is over yes
youre gonna tell him and youre gonna tell him
about this guy that you kissed
are you promising me that
i absolutely swear to god yes
im so disappointed in you ronny
okay
just pick a date
and ask beth to marry you
youre making this thing out to be
much more than it needs to be
and now your stress is causing me stress
thats right im stressing out like crazy yeah
youre right youre totally right
now that you verbalize it and i hear
it youre completely right man
thank you
now im a guy causing extra damn stress
you ever get a massage
hmm
in times like this when it gets very
stressful do you get a massage
have i had a massage i mean
no not really really no
you can only do so much yourself
you can do things yourself
but when you get a professional
to get that take it out of you
and get that stress right out
of you throw it out of you
hey nick you know what could be tremendous
maybe me and you could go and
get a massage together
i dont mean in the same room or something
i mean at the same place
do you know a place we could do that
where we could get a massage
a place that could take us to relax relax relax
heres what im trying to say to you okay
dont let fear sabotage letting yourself be happy
you guys are great together youre in love
and love can be very rewarding
and it can be very filling
very filling
like a warm stew it honestly is
look if you want ice cream
go in the car and get ice cream
you dont worry that while im driving
hey i might have some chest pains
and then turns out heart attack
im having a heart attack
you veer off you kill a bunch of seniors and toddlers
you get your ice cream
and you know what 99 of the time youre
gonna end up at the ice cream shop
with a big hot fudge sundae nuts
only one percent of the time do you kill the innocent
its pretty good odds
im not understanding what youre trying to say to me
all right ronny

two sides to every story
oh jesus christ
ronny you followed him to the massage parlor

to call and let you know

good night ronny
yeah good night princess just
make sure youre ready
to talk to your husband when
you go home tonight honey
because im definitely going to talk to him
okay just take a breath
besides i have something you might want
to hear before you go and do that
what is it
i ordered you some coffee
i dont need your goddamn coffee geneva
i dont have anything to talk to you about
im gonna go see nick tonight
and im going to tell him that
his wife is sick and twisted
and that shes a liar
and im going to tell him that hes
married to goddamn helen keller
helen keller yeah
the girl with all the personalities
sybil
yeah sybil
who are you today blanche
how deep do the waters run
youre a fiveyearold on a playground ronald
its not like i want to go and see zip
but when my husband calls me to explain
he has another late meeting
it kind of just flies out the window
zip thats the guys name zip
the point is ronny i dont want any of this
i love my husband
you got a real funny way of showing that
stay out of my life
youre not a therapist
in fact you need one desperately
look in the mirror youre 40 years
old youve never been married
go fix yourself and then you can call me
i dont need to call you i dont need
to say anything to you anymore
all i need to do is get out of here and
go tell nick that his wife is cheating
and i guess because you werent able to do
the things that you really said you needed to do
that thats just the way its going
to have to go down honey
you know what i see it going down
just a little bit differently
really yeah
because im going to deny it
and then im going to say you made a pass at me
i made a pass at you yep
and considering our little secret
im pretty sure hell believe me
geneva okay
we both decided not to say anything
because you liked him and we didnt
want to ruin something good
over a drunken college night
that happened three months before
you two ever started dating
but ronny he doesnt know that
it didnt mean anything geneva
yeah well it means something now doesnt it
see you need to understand how
this is going to play out ronny
im going tell him how we slept
together all those years ago
and then im going to say that you
started making passes at me
and that they never stopped
you do that
you sell him that ive been hitting
on you for 20 years straight
i shouldve told you nick i shouldve told you sooner
but ronny insisted that we not say anything
but as the years went on it got harder and harder
and i just lied to myself and said it didnt matter
but im telling you this now because
ronny has gone crazy
hes been throwing me up against restaurant walls
right when youre right around the corner
its like he wants you to see he wants to get caught
because he feels so guilty
but i dont feel safe anymore nick
okay
and this had to come out
then what are you going to do ronny
mr moral guy
are you going to look your best friend
in the eyes and lie to him
and say no that never happened
i never slept with her
i dont think so
stay out of my marriage
now if youll excuse me
good night sybil
i dont even know if youre there god
i havent really tried to ring you up
ever since i asked for those parlays
when things were tough
and i know you didnt help me
with those for my own good
because i had stuff i had to learn but
i dont want to learn any lessons on this one
i really dont want to lose my best friend
i know im supposed to give you things
but im scared to give you this
if you are listening
and if you want to help us with
the whole chrysler thing

if that could go our way that would be really great

ronny what the
ron
get a good feel buddy
ronny
you remember my cousin james

because families like to touch and hang
out and thats what were doing
im just roughing it up with my guy
come on i had him i had him juan
nice to meet you buddy my
guy good to see you babe
and my parents
ronald
yeah burt and sue
its impressive 40 years its quite an accomplishment
is the flame still burning after 40
still there
of course it is of course it is
with you theres no question my man
lets go celebrate lets do this
im just playing the fun part doing the things i do
great to see you
breath against breath
breathe me life
thousand and thousand kisses give me i beg you
love wants everything without condition
love has no law
mom and dad
your love has no law
so beautiful
id like to make the toast
forty years
that is a long time to be with
someone forty years wow
its impressive
i personally dont know a lot about marriage
but i would imagine it cant be easy
all those 40 years being with someone
because people are not perfect
people make mistakes in life
but i would assume
what would get you through those 40 years would be
honesty
honesty and honesty alone
and love
but even more than that burt is the honesty
dont forget about patience
oh no ones going to forget about patience sue
you can relax patience is on the table
what im talking about
though is honesty here
talking about two people
who have probably had an eye
wander every now and then
everyone knows burt was in the garment business
if you dont think you meet a
lot of girls in that business
then you dont get out of the house much
a lot of girls
a lot
goodlooking guy wellspoken
its pinch me im dreaming time am i right ladies
and look at sue gorgeous lady easy to be around
always into the aerobics
kept it tight in a great way
and burt did well they have
a pool pool guy come over
lot of guys would come over to
the house young guys too
now lets say something did happen
we dont know that it did maybe it didnt
but its not up to us to know its up to them to know
i bet they were honest with each other
i bet she came to him and said hey burt
you know youre my number one
but maybe mama got thirsty last night
what im going to focus on though
here is the ingredient
that i think really makes the whole stew
stick together and that is honesty
and similar interests
who are you
im cousin betty
first
second
okay cousin betty this is not a group toast
nor is it an open forum
im the one whos standing up here
im the one with the glass im the one that is talking
now burt and sue chime in
and thats fine because its their night
you know 40 years and all of that
but not you
nobody gave you a speaking part nobody cares
youre a second cousin which isnt even a real relative
because someone could have sex with a second cousin
and the kid could still be normal
honesty
you cannot run from it
and believe me
itll find you
the truth will always find you
burt and sue
forty years being honest
burt and sue
congratulations
can i speak to you in the kitchen
i was just going to finish my please
sure okay
i need to know whats going on
nothing
im just toasting and im passionate about honesty
im not talking about the inappropriate toast
that you just gave at my parents anniversary
or the bar fight
or the allergies that you caught from
street plants while chasing fat kids
im talking about
whats going on in your head
thats causing these things
its just some stuff that i have to fix
thats it honey and i cant bring you in on it
because that would directly affect my ability to do that
to do what to fix it
fix it fix it
i have to fix it on my own honey
okay ronny youre not fixing anything
and youre breaking more stuff
and its enough
you just gave a whole speech about honesty
its time for you to be honest with me
is it yeah
is it honest time now between us
then why dont you start beth
why dont you tell me about the kearny group
how do you know about the kearny group
are you going to las vegas
are you planning on leaving me
god ronny no no
they asked me to open up a restaurant
in city center and i said no
why
because that would mean id have to go live
in las vegas for a couple of years
and
and what beth
and i dont trust you in las vegas
okay
ronny
look at you
your sponsor called me
you havent been going to your meetings
youre walking around with large amounts of cash
and it just really feels like two years ago
you know i
i cant get into this with you right now
if you dont let me in how do i know what to do
how can i help you
i think its best if i go
i dont want you to go
im going to go sleep at the office tonight
you want to do this
what are you doing
watching you sleep
its creepy right
felix go play with the hot tub and
the ladies on the line honestly
im just getting up its too much youre too much
please give me a minute i dont know where im at
oh god hey man whats going on
come on in the house
what are you going to shoot me right here
on your porch in broad daylight
are you out of your mind
no not if youre in the house
ive googled this
do you want to know how it works yeah
you come inside and i defend myself
now im not going to pump six bullets into you
no that would make me look crazy and out of control
no im going to pump three into you
like a calm gunowner would
zip i came here with the intent and only the intent
of getting my camera back
oh yeah your camera
come on inside
if you just want your camera its right here
listen to me
i can really appreciate the fact that things got
completely nuts the other night
and i can also appreciate that a lot of your property
i appreciate the fact that a lot of your
property got damaged as well
you killed my fish
you killed my fish man i know
why would you do that
maybe you should be compensated for that
you should be compensated for that
i cant put a price on that because thats a friend
although you cant pet it but what would the fish do
the fish doesnt want this man
i think what the fish is saying is maybe
i should get my camera back
and maybe just maybe and im
just hoping against hope here
maybe we can put this whole thing behind us
i have a thousand ill give you the thousand
and an apology
zip if i apologize to you when you
have a gun pointed at my throat
then i dont think it really counts
thats a good point
im sorry for what happened
i need to feel it
i just need it to really come from right there
look man im sorry all right
im sorry im really sorry
im really really sorry that were
standing here in this situation
im sorry
okay
seven eight nine 10
and the 400 i owe for the old persons home perfect
you did this to me
you know that
i dont mess with firearms i dont do that
i dont do that look im a sensitive guy
you know what im saying to you
okay

better prepared but i guess
we can start
ronny why dont you come join us
who are you
my name is dr rosenstone
your family and friends are here
because they love you ronald
and they cant stand to see you
destroy yourself anymore
what is this an intervention
yes
we dont see the need for labels
this is just a bunch of friends talking to one friend
and letting them know they love them
an intervention
your sister and her husband would like to start
i tormented you i know
diane please dont do this
i dressed you up like a little girl
but im here to support you
ronny i am
okay okay its not what you think
i dont know

okay
why dont we all come in and sit down
come on
let ronny sit down
we got a big blue chair waiting for ronny
come on sweetheart sit down itll be okay
well its no coincidence
that we find ourselves here in
a gentle circle of support
hey
oh shit am i late
im sorry i know its probably really bad
form to be late to an intervention
hi im beth
hi beth whats going on
hey big guy
who the hell invited him
you know what i invited him
you did you invited him
yeah you know what i followed
you to his place earlier today
i saw you pay him
and after you left i went up and talked
to him
it says right here
if possible its best to have all enablers present
even bookies
so i agreed to pay your debt if he agreed
to come here tonight and he did
thanks man i appreciate this
it was really nice of you no problem
you got to be kidding me
hes not my bookie nick
oh come on ronny

okay thats what im doing
look he bets on the bulls and the sox
the cubs
he bet on the hawaii game
only degenerates bet on the hawaii game
i dont want that for you man

i think you need to take a look at this
what is you got to look theres more pictures
you got to flip through that one
get to the other pictures

i keep flipping and it keeps going back to the same pic
because theres only one picture in the catalogue
you cant take a picture of something
that didnt happen ronald
ronny

ronny calm down
stop it youre going to kill him
youre going to kill your bookie
hes not my damn bookie
theres something wrong with you
you son of a bitch
what is wrong with you
youre completely out of control
youre crazy
youre completely out of your mind
dont get me wrong id like to party
with you and get high with you
but youre insane
i think were missing the point of this gathering
its about talking and sharing our concerns
this is ridiculous
then let me go okay because
i have something to say
take a seat please everybody sit
beth please just sit down
look heres the thing
please just let me please okay
all right
ah man that was
all right i got something to say
this is important to me so
okay nick
all right please please
i didnt have many friends when i got to ball state
i was shy and
you already know this
but ronny what you dont know is
when you moved in across the
hall in second semester
i made it a goal of mine
to become friends with you
i mean you were funny and charming
and everybody liked him everybody
okay nick enough
you got to let me talk here for a second
i want you to listen to me
nick youre my best friend
you always make me do better
you always make sure i dont screw up
and you make it that i never forget
what really matters in life
when i had my relapse two years ago
it wasnt all the money and stuff that
i lost that made me feel bad
it was the fact that i let you down
this is good
this is catharsis
i know
you know i never had a brother growing up right
and my dad wasnt around very much
and all my friends growing up were really criminals
so when i met you in school i was
lets just say that i looked up
to you as well in college
and i really have looked up to you ever since
so theres something that you should know
theres something that i already
should have told you nick
what is it
genevas been running on you
with the guy that you thought was my bookie
jesus christ ronny
you thought that you saw an exchange right
that it was a gambling exchange
but it wasnt a gambling exchange
really i was just going to get my camera
because there were pictures and stuff on it
the truth is im not gambling
i havent been doing any gambling at all
whats been going on with me is
ive really been trying to figure out
whats the best way to tell you
and how to handle this thing
is this true
no its not true
hes lying
hes compulsive hes a gambler
hell say anything hes desperate
go ahead geneva tell him the truth
everyone is sitting here listening
okay fine fine
uh
the thing is that
okay fine
what did you expect
you were getting happy endings in pilsen
jeez
no no nick listen
you left me alone i wanted to be with you but
can we not get into this right now
no but thats the problem
you never want to talk about anything ever
i know that its been tough with us for a while now
and i take my part in that
but isnt there something about us you still believe in
how long did you know
ive known for a few days a week for way too long
i dont know what to say i dont even
know what im feeling right now
honestly i dont know
i do know this you should have
told me sooner ronny
before right now
before standing here in front of your friends
and your family and doctor
rose i know it starts
with rose rosenstone
stone buddy i know
im really sorry i tried to tell you in the office
what do you mean trying trying is not telling ronny
come on look i can appreciate
how hard this must have been on you i know
im just really glad that you say that
you can appreciate how hard it was
because you dont even know
ive been fighting with these people
trying to keep everything straight in my head
i get it
but in the nature of whats going on here
theres one more small thing that i
just want to bring closure to now
in the circle of gentleness
ronny you dont have to
yes i do geneva
because nick is my best friend
and this is what best friends do
they tell the truth to each other
okay when we were in college
and this is way before you guys ever met
there was a night that didnt mean anything
it was a meaningless night
it was a booze night
it was big big bar night
ronny get to the point
the point is way before you guys ever met
before you ever even knew each other
i kind of slept with geneva
you what
this is what friends do they tell the truth
im a friend and im telling the
truth buddy here i am
he wanted to tell you nick
but i was falling in love with you
we didnt want to hurt you
you asshole hold on hold on
im telling the truth im in a circle
no you know what youre the worst
buddy im sorry okay listen
get your hands off me dont touch me
let me tell you something
thats probably the most honest
thing youve ever said to me
nick youre sorry
youre so sorry
nick
im sorry ronny
im sorry
i should never have put you in that position
beth i am so sorry that i caused
tension between you two
im sorry
this has been a marvelous first step
im sorry
this has been a revelation for you i can tell
im okay buddy thank you
youve done a lot here today
i didnt gamble
i walked by the casino once or
twice but i didnt gamble
are you okay
its been a long day
i didnt know if you had eaten or not so
if youre hungry
i dont know how to start this
i got scared
and im sorry
because i didnt feel safe
so then i didnt tell you about las
vegas and the kearny group
and then here i am being someone
that i dont want to be
i mean i staged this whole
ridiculous intervention thing
and you werent even gambling
and thats great by the way
im so happy that you werent gambling
but this is no good
its not healthy
the problem is if you dont share stuff with me
like the fact that you were with geneva
it keeps me in the dark
and that belittles us
i want us to be more than that
i understand
i just didnt feel right in saying something to you
if i wasnt saying it to nick
and then when i found out
about the vegas deal
and that you didnt trust me enough
to share that with me
then that really hurt
but i guess ive earned that
and its up to me to unearn that
i dont ever want to put you through
anything like this ever again
because honestly honey i do love you
i love you too
and
i understand
youve got a chrysler meeting tomorrow dont you
i dont even know if nick is going to show up
you werent a terrible friend ronny
i mean you sucked at the way you handled things
but you cared
yes
ronny valentine
the other half of the team
ill let the gang know tell them youre both here
thank you i appreciate that
how are you doing
well i moved out
how are you feeling
shaky
on how everything went down
the truth is i was just
hanging on to something that wasnt there
it wasnt fair to her
im sorry buddy
im sorry youre going through this nick
listen i feel terrible about the whole situation
and ive been sick to my stomach
for the last 24 hours man
ive been doing a lot of soulsearching
and thinking about
what friendship really means
and the thing of it is
there it is
okay good thats good
nick i feel terrible about this whole thing all right
and if that makes you feel better
for me honestly i just want
to get past this thing okay
so if you want to hit me again
ow
oh my god

great
were ready for you
well be just one sec were ready well come right in
well well be in the presentation area
i know where it is ill be right there
good grief
were really looking forward to this opportunity
you handled this whole thing like shit
im sorry nick
i really am
i know i didnt date a lot
so when geneva and i were serious
you didnt want to hurt me
and it was before we ever got together
now im not saying it was easy
the spot you were in because it wasnt
but in the future
no matter how uncomfortable things are
if it affects us
you got to tell me
do you got it
i promise you nick
i got it
okay
all right there you go
im good
excuse me mr valentine
given what we just saw in the waiting
room i think we need to
oh that were like kids in a
car too long on a road trip
were fine were just working
the moment of truth
has finally arrived
now i know that the journey getting
here has had some turbulence
and some confusion
but i ask you for one second
when folks were reaching for greatness
was that not the case
i remember a group of people
who wanted to head west
with dreams of gold and opportunity
the donner party
the donner pass
things got a little weird out on the trail didnt it
some cannibalism folks got hungry
some feelings hurt some families destroyed
but some people made it out west
not all of them
and its not that they necessarily got rich
but the point is
weve headed out west and this is our destination
nick
start your engine
you son of a bitch
i told you the difference was nick brannen
and we have nick brannen
simply the best
you can feel it
better than all the rest
you were right about these lunatics susan
commit to the longterm deal and cut them a check
and thats why i love you guys
thats why i love you
thats why my lady wood is still strong
see i get it they dont get it
they dont get it but i do
see all that fighting and shit thats just passion
when you work that close you just want to choke
the hell out of somebody right
yeah see i understand that
i relate but listen
that motor
that motor in that car
i mean when it started vibrating im sorry
if i was sitting on the hood of that car okay
and the way it was just vibrating
i understand and i got to be really honest with you
when i first met you your phraseology
with lady wood
i didnt know whether you were coming or going
but ive really grown to love you
yes yes come on come on
