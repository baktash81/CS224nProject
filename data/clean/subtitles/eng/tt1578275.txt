completely naked  right outside the office 
and he says   ronny told me to show up  
hey  i have a question for the table 
how long does it take to really know someone 
i think you re continually
getting to know someone 
 cause i think people change when they grow 
but i do think if you go through hell with someone 
then you get a pretty good sense
of how they handle stuff 
which is important 
come on  we re on the other side of that one 
i don t know 
i think you can know someone within
the first 10 seconds of seeing them 
i mean  i fell in love with geneva the second i saw her 
aw   
it s true  i did 
well  i don t know if you ever
really know someone entirely 
and what is that supposed to mean  yeah 
well  i mean  you know someone 
you think pretty good 
and then you find out stuff that s shocking
that you didn t know existed 
i think that happens every day 
look at that show 20 20  it s always
the same thing  right 
they re a couple  they re happy 
no one could believe it 
there are a lot of these cases 
what about the guy with the crossbow 
he buys a crossbow  he s practicing in the garage 
 by the way  bring me some lemonade 
 oh  my goodness  i had no idea you walked
through at that moment  oops  
  continue  please  continue 
  that is gross 
but she forgives him  it was an
accident  and guess what 
six months later  same accident  yes  and it kills her 
no  yes 
no 
and  look it  you hear all the time about these families
that have entirely other families 
the dad  who knows what he does for a living 
he leaves to go to connecticut 
but he was never going to connecticut on business 
he s really going to harlem  he s
got a puerto rican family
that no one ever heard about  yeah 
you think when he s watching the game  instead
of pretzels  he s eating goya beans 
red flags  but they don t catch it 
so my point is  you can really
think you know somebody 
and then it turns out that you don t
know everything about somebody 
all right  ronny  you still haven t
answered the question 
no  i just did  you didn t 
no  you didn t answer it  you re skirting it 
you re not answering straight up  come on 
you re bouncing around  you re doing
this   hey   when you re doing this   
you do that a lot  by the way 
i think you re all special peoples 
you re out of your mind 
and you re nothing of the sort 
this is our shot  i need you to hug him 
i don t want to hug him 
look it  ever since he had a near death experience 
he s become a very touchy feely
guy  and he likes to be held 
look  you know i don t like touching
people i don t know very well  okay 
or even people i do  so just   
nick  do you want this thing or not 
of course i do 
then feed the beast here 
this guy has a hot button  a point
of interest  his hot button is hugs 
you hug him  you re gonna crack him wide open 
he s going to start feeling all bubbly inside 
then he starts writing checks 
all right 
i m not asking you to go to an airport motel
and perform a trick on a japanese businessman 
i m asking you to hug a senior executive
from general motors  that s all 
now get your arms around him 
and make him feel bubbly and warm 
i ll tell you what 
why don t you let charles take you guys
over here and show you the entire line 
and it s great to have you here 
thank you 
man 
this puppy here reminds me of my first dodge 
uh huh 
remember that 
remember when cars were meant just
to be fun things to have  right 
they made a cool noise  they harnessed real power
and they made you feel like a badass
because you got to be the one right
there behind the wheel of it  right 
i m sorry  i m ronny valentine
from b   v engine design 
thomas fern  yeah  thomas  good to see you again

your soul was too important to take 
you ve got great days ahead of you  my friend

we ll come up there to rock city 
to detroit  and come see you 
okay  yeah

you are unbelievable  did we get the meeting or not 
i m hugging this man like i m some kind of asshole

you re never gonna find a girl as great as her 
let s be realistic 
nick and i aren t making any new friends 
you ve dated all my girlfriends 
you ve batted through the whole lineup 
and there s nothing left  you know 
plus  we like her 
those other ones  we didn t even

because i m cooking something up  chef 
don t play into my strength 
whoo 
fifteen to four 
really  you re gonna start    now you re dancing

at ping pong  that s ridiculous 
you re only supposed to do that if the game s over 
if the game s over  i m just being happy  you know 
no  no  you re not being happy  this is a taunting 
this is  like  taunting that s going on  i m sorry 
you re not sorry  that s the problem 
i know  you re right 
okay  here s what we need to do now 
 cause i think you re very spirited  and i like that 
i think we should turn it into
full body contact ping pong 
yes  we do 
come on  you can t taunt people bigger than you
and expect it just to be all fine 
help 
you re attacked  yes  that s it 
are you gonna try and steal a kiss now 
go on  i dare you 
i want to let you know  by the way 
that i m completely committed to this relationship 
i m just re upping  i m already committed 
but i m just re upping my commitment
to this relationship
because i feel great 
how do you feel  do you feel great 
uh huh 
yeah  mmm hmm  i feel great 
but is there a window 
are you anxious for this to go somewhere 
ronny  ronny  i know you 
i know where you re headed with this 
look  i don t need this to be something that it s not 
i don t want it to be something if
it s not  just to make me okay 
but is there a clock that s ticking 
are you in a hurry to be heading somewhere 
there s always a clock  and i m worrying  is it ticking 
getting to a point where the clock s gonna go off 
let s just talk through this  okay  yeah 
i have fun with you  i love being with you 
i think we ve done a great job of getting
back to a really good place 
i m happy 
now  if all of that rolls into something else 
that can make me happy  too 
i love you 
okay  ronny  you can do this 
this is your time to do it 
you the man  valentine  you re the man 
folks  this is our
final approach to detroit s metro airport 
hope this goes well 
great moments are born from great opportunity 
and that s what you have here today  nick 
that s what you ve earned here today 
one meeting  okay  what are you doing 
you re giving me the    really 
the kurt russell speech from the movie miracle 
i just saw that five year old kid do
it on youtube the other night 
and i thought it was really inspirational 
it s applicable to what we re doing 
any time you go into a pressure situation 
a competition  it makes sense 
and i m not gonna write something better than that 
look at you  you re nervous 
you re never nervous  now  you re nervous 
okay  here s the thing  i can t be
broke if i m gonna get married 
yeah 
yes  see  i knew you would get here 
okay  so here s my plan 
i m gonna ask her next month  on her birthday 
now  i worked out this great
deal from this hasidic guy 
who i met during gamblers anonymous 
he s literally gonna give me a  20 000 ring
for  10 000  can you believe that 
how are you doing that 
well  i m gonna give him cash 
and then i also said that you would help fix his car 
so those two little things are gonna
get me the deal with the hasidic 
oh  i m helping  i m helping fix the car 
well  you re the one who kept telling me to dive into it 
i thought you d be excited to help  i m sorry 
okay  fine  but that is my gift to you 
honestly  there ll be no fruit bowl from the registry 
that s it  that s what you re looking at 
you don t have to make a decision now 
on the day  see what s right   
no  i m making    i can make the
decision now  i m making it now 
i m telling you right now  that is my gift 
that s it  i m fixing the car with the hasidic guy 
and make sure you tell beth that  too 
seriously  i don t want it to be
uncomfortable  let her know 
whatever you wanna do on that day is your choice 
okay  i m doing it 
you take this meeting 10 times 
you might not get it nine 
all right  you got to stop that now 
but not this meeting  nick 
not today 
you re really making me nervous 
today  we are the greatest small business in the world 
i m sick and tired of hearing about how
innovative these other boutiques are 
this is our time  their time is done 
we re showing up in a cab 
thanks for not mentioning that my
last three prototype bids got rejected 
that s just a bad streak  pal 
you re gonna be great  i promise you 
here you go 
ladies and gentlemen  electric cars 
they re totally gay 
it s true 
i don t mean that they re  homosexual  gay 
but i do mean  your parents were the
chaperone at the dance  gay  right 
 you tuck it in and wear it real high  gay 
i don t wanna disrespect anybody 
 cause i m not about that 
but i think we re understanding
what we re trying to talk about here  right 
i mean  honestly  the nissan spit  really 
it screams this 
oh  here we go 
the hyundai pomegranate  right 
the chevy fingerprint 
now 
ah  look at this 
the 1966 ford gt350 
you wanna roll up in that one  hoss 
the 1965 pontiac gto 
completely awesome 
the 1970 hemi cuda
took more virginities than francis albert sinatra 
what are we suggesting here 
we re talking about taking the benefits
of electric transportation 
but combine them with the rock and roll ness
and the sexiness that the dodge
current muscle car models have 
nicholas 
we believe we could produce the technology
to incorporate an electronic motor
in your current models 
but with the aggressive sound character 
the exhilarating vibration character 
the complete visceral experience
that we ve all grown to know and love in
the dodge challenger and charger lines 
guys  we love our current electric models 
that said  we also agree there s a
market for what you re pitching 
but  if you re asking dodge to invest
in your pursuit of this concept 
what do you have that we don t 
nick brannen 
so let s forget the up front money 
let s deal with it in success because that s
exactly what we re gonna have 
i want 900 000  you want 400 000 
we don t need to get a chinese auction where
i go   850   you go   450   right 
 eight    five  
let s just cut it right down the middle
at 775  and close this thing 
i appreciate your spirit  mr  valentine 
but we re taking all the risk 
so we ll stick with the 400 000 
and i think you need to focus
on the bigger picture  here 
with success and a good working relationship 
we re prepared to offer you an overall
deal  which means up front money
and an option for an exclusive long term
contract with your company 
and with that deal  you gentlemen
won t be disappointed 
you made a great decision today  tom 
thank you  thank you 
you ll be under the supervision of susan warner  here 
she s from the outside  but we ve
had great experience with her 
you know  i was at ford
until about five months ago 
they re still talking about you guys over there 
they said you could whittle down a supplier
to less than 15 cents on the dollar just by talking 
and you were like a mad scientist that
wouldn t leave the lab for days 
well  boys 
it takes one to know one 
i m one of you 
i m a visionary  i m a maverick 
i m a gun slinger  just like you 
and this idea of yours  this vision   
i m inspired by what y all throwing down 
i got some serious lady wood here 
i want to have sex with your words 
i want to bang your brain 
oh  i got to go  i m late for mommy
and me  i ll call you 
bye  okay 
at least she s enthusiastic 
ronny  i got to tell you 
i think i m starting
to have a panic attack 
what if i can t deliver  i mean  we
sank every cent we have into this 
we re mortgaged to the hilt  we re
borrowing against borrowing 
okay  listen  just relax 
i think you re taking this all in a little
too fast  just a little too soon 
now  you said it yourself 
we re on the five yard line  we just got to punch it in 
twenty five  what 
i said we were on the 25 yard line 
nick  are you suggesting that we re
not even in the red zone 
oh  man  what if i can t do it 
everybody    just think  dodge is gonna
know  they re gonna laugh at us 
that guy  that security guard  he s just laughing 
look at him  he s just staring    hold on 
look at the security guard  he s looking at me 
okay  stop  get it together  stop looking at me 
just take a breath for a second 
don t lose perspective here 
you re only five yards from the red zone 
now once we get in the red zone  we re a mortal lock 
you re a red zone guy 
still 25 yards out  do you understand that 
by the way  i don t care how you spin
it  how you want to ice the cake 
we re only 75  of the way there 
and i m having trouble breathing now 
you need to relax 
everything is going to be fine 
i never said we were in the red zone 
so  it s been 10 days since the meeting 
and he still hasn t calmed down 
i m doing my best to keep his head in the game 
but he s still a little shaky 
all right  we are going with the opakapaka tonight 
okay  but we need to educate the servers 
please  they know  chef 
they know  no  they don t know 
they re fish illiterate 
what about you  ronny 
also fish illiterate  i don t know fish 
i m saying  how are you doing 
how are you coping with all of this 
i m great  honey 
it s been 16 months and nine days since
i made a bet  i m easy breezy 
i m not talking about gambling 
i m just saying  if you re feeling stressed 
or if things start to feel heavy   
yes  heavy 
   then you can come talk to me 
honey  if i m lucky enough to get
you alone for five minutes

wow  this is what i m talking about 
see this  right here  this place here is beautiful 
and the music that you re playing 
that s really beautiful  too 
people say that music is the highest art form 
it can go the farthest  the fastest  emotionally 
and the smells here are really nice
as well  i love all the smells 
what i m trying to do is get all five senses
really coming alive here  really cooking 
mmm hmm  do you have a plug
in the garden somewhere 
somewhere i can plug my ipod dock into 
anywhere in here  back here  oh  see  wait  wait  no 
we don t like the guest touching the plants 
why  i mean  if you talk to them  they grow 
they like a little affection  i wouldn t pull it out 
i just wanna make sure that you re taking
care of all the things on your end 
because i m going today  i m going to have the ring 
so that ll be taken care of 
i trust you ll have a ring 
and i just want to make sure that
this is the greatest proposal
in the history of the world of all proposals 
all right  that s it 
let me see if i can track down where that outlet is 
okay  get me in here for a team 
let s go   proposal   on three

mr  valentine 
son of a bitch 
don t do it  geneva  jesus 
oh  god 
what are you doing 
ah  those plants are poisonous 
awesome 
you can expect diarrhea 
challenging urination with possible bloody discharge 
fever  dry heaving 
painful swelling of the gums and
a loss of feeling in the tongue 
which will affect speech and give you very bad dreams 
you are banned from these gardens indefinitely 
so you can forget about
popping the question here 
 proposal on three  
we are not teammates 
as far as damages 
it s going to run into the thousands 
i just saw my best friend s wife with another man 
i ll send you a check 
it s very red 
looks really angry 
i didn t think you were allergic
to anything  neither did i 
huh  what kind of plants were they 
street plants 
street plants 
yeah  it must ve happened when
i was walking on clark 
because i had to go    these kids lost their ball 
and i had to go in the bushes and get their ball 
why couldn t they get their own ball 
well  you know how these kids are
today  they re so damn lazy 
i mean  with all the gaming  and
texting  and happy meals 
i mean  childhood obesity is completely out of control 
you know that  beth 
and these kids were just overly huffing
and puffing  and they were sweating 
all right  well  i don t see why that means
they can t go get their own ball 
well  to their credit  these little porkers were trying 
but they couldn t reach the ball 
this little alligator armed kid was in there doing it 
but the little kid  he can t get the ball 
so then i come walking up 
and they say   hey  can you
help me with the ball here  
so i say   okay  i m running late  
but these kids want to play ball  and
frankly  i m a supporter of it 
now that we re all gonna be on the
same damn healthcare  too 
i m paying for these fat kids 
boom  i drop to the ground 
so now  i m reaching in here like this
trying to get the ball  see 
but i don t want this branch to hit me here 
right  i m doing it  you see what i mean  honey 
and i got to dig in more  under the
branch  but hold the branch 
but then my right hand s going here 
see  that s why i got this bitch right here 
oh  that s a direct contact 
and i get the ball  now i get it 
i got the ball out   okay  here  
gave the ball back to the kids 
then i started to head home  right 
and then that s when i noticed
that my arm was really itching
and i thought that it was because
i rubbed up against the brush 
why are you carrying so much cash  ronny 
well  i was on my way to the suppliers 
before i helped the fat kids with the ball 
but  boy  thank goodness
it fell out here  that s great 
because  could you imagine if it
would ve fallen out there  wow 
yeah  that s a lot of cash 
well  you know my suppliers deal in cash 
but do you mind if i don t dial
into all the details right now 
i m just starting to really itch 
so i d rather just go and take care of this real quick 
how was your day 
it was okay 
god  damn it

a little challenged here

i can t get enough of it  i really can t  thank you

come on  let s awaken the beast here  come on 
we ve got a solid reference measurement

david  jump in there  fire it up  come on

fourth order  pulling ahead

yes  yes  yes 
whoo hoo 
hold on  hold on  hold on 
the fractional orders are deviating 
no  no  no  they re not  come on 
now 
what have we got  what have we got 
where we at 
no  no 
damn it 
we lost the fourth completely 
maybe a heavier amp  bigger subs 
the second and third were solid until   
hey  i get it  i suck  okay 
i suck 
nick    what is it  ron  what do you want 
i want to talk to you about something
that s kind of personal 
something that doesn t have to do with any of this 
do you mind just stepping up with
me in the office real quick 
you want to go to the office  talk
about something personal
that doesn t have to do with this 
yeah 
you know  i m bleeding inside 
there s blood where it shouldn t be in
my body  out of things 
i ve thrown up four times in the last two days 
which doesn t make any sense  because
i haven t eaten in three 
so i don t even know where it s coming from 
hey  listen  i understand what you re saying   
you re not in the pressure cooker  man  you re not 
when i said i was on the 25 yard line  i m not 
i m much further back than that 
we are deep in our own end zone 
right back there  yeah 
and i m flushed out of the pocket 
and the defense is coming for me 
and they re big  man  they re fast 
ah  they re coming  and i turn
to you  my lead blocker 
you turn to me   hey 
 you want to go upstairs and talk in the
office about something personal  
just block 
that s what i need you to do  is just block 
and do me a favor  would you
sign the damn loan forms 
so i have somebody to fund my failure 
unless you just want to kiss that
long term contract goodbye 
unbelievable  huh 
the bulls  i know  it s ridiculous 
i mean  rose should ve passed to noah 
he was wide open  completely unguarded 
i know  man  they just can t get it together at all 
yeah  i mean  if you ask me  rose doesn t trust noah 
they re teammates  he doesn t trust
he can hit the winning shot 
sucks  man 
yeah  because trust really runs deep on a team 
you got to be able to trust your teammate 
do you think that you have to be able to trust
your teammate off the court as well 
uh    sure  let s just say 
and i m talking completely hypothetically here 
let s say that noah finds out that
derek rose s girl is cheating 
does he tell him or not 
because he doesn t want to affect his performance 
yeah  i mean  he s    no  no 
yeah  you tell him  no 
it s toxic to keep all that in  you have to tell him 
that s guy code  you re talking about your best friend 
you ever hear the expression   kill
the messenger    cause  i mean   
yeah  but i don t think it applies here at all 
i mean  if you don t tell your friend  your best friend 
then you re basically banging her  too 
okay  come on  now  it depends  is it the playoffs 
game seven  the championship 
championship 
no  then i wouldn t tell him 
yeah  no way  no 
don t tell him  nope  you wait  you wait 
hey  sis  just checking in 
ronny  you never call to just  check in  
you know what happened  i saw
this episode of springer 
and i just can t shake what happened on the episode

i don t know that tonight s a good
night for us to go do anything

you earlier  and i talked to felix 
and he said things were getting pretty heated today 
i think you guys need a break  you know

they know what they re doing 
they do statistics to make sure that
a certain amount of people miss it 
i mean  i don t know how
much you ve dealt with athletes 
i can see things differently 
everything just comes to a blur 
it s like you re locked in maple
syrup  and you re moving slow
and you see things happening before they do happen

hey 
i saw you yesterday 
you saw me where 
at the botanical gardens 
so 
i saw it all  geneva 
the loser with the dead milkmen t shirt 
kissing him in broad daylight 
okay  ronny  i got it 
you got a great guy who s considerate to people 
and who cares about you  and
you re out running on him 
don t put this all on me 
how dare you ambush me with
what you think you know 
what i think i know  i saw you
mauling the guy  geneva 
ronny  you don t know shit  you don t know shit 
you do not know what goes on behind
the curtains of a marriage 
like the fact that he hasn t slept
with me for over six months 
don t stand there and start talking nonsense to me 
no  you know what  are you serious 
how about the fact that every
thursday night after work 
nick goes to pilsen  to a massage parlor 
where he gets wanked by a
19 year old vietnamese girl
who speaks four words of english  how about that 
i don t believe a word you re
saying right now 
yeah  you re just covering your ass 
listen to me 
nick is my very best friend
in the entire world  i know 
and i am never  ever  ever going
to keep this from him 
do you understand  so i m coming to you now 
and i m giving you an opportunity 
but you need to deal with this 
but it only happened because my husband
wasn t intimate with me  i m not a marriage counselor 
i don t want to be a marriage counselor 
let s make it really  really simple then 
either you tell him  or i will 
i can t 
i will 
no  no  ronny  no  yes 
no  ronny  no  don t do this now 
not while this chrysler thing is going on 
listen  nick is not sleeping at night 
his stomach is literally bleeding 
this would destroy him 
you re not going to see this guy anymore 
no  god  no  that was stupid  i know that was stupid 
and it s over  it s over because it never was 
then why have you been texting him all night 
have i  yeah  you have 
sitting on the blackberry 
banging people 
your sister just bought a new dress 
just like i was saying  ronny  you don t know shit 
are you promising me
that as soon as this bit is over    yes 
   you re gonna tell him  and you re gonna tell him
about this guy that you kissed 
are you promising me that 
i absolutely swear to god  yes 
i m so disappointed in you  ronny 
okay 
just pick a date
and ask beth to marry you 
you re making this thing out to be
much more than it needs to be 
and now your stress is causing me stress 
that s right  i m stressing out like crazy  yeah 
you re right  you re totally right 
now that you verbalize it  and i hear
it  you re completely right  man 
thank you 
now i m a guy causing extra damn stress 
you ever get a massage 
hmm 
in times like this  when it gets very
stressful  do you get a massage 
have i had a massage  i mean 
no  not really  really  no 
you can only do so much yourself 
you can do things yourself 
but when you get a professional
to get that  take it out of you
and get that stress right out
of you  throw it out of you 
hey  nick  you know what could be tremendous 
maybe me and you could go and
get a massage together 
i don t mean in the same room or something 
i mean at the same place 
do you know a place we could do that 
where we could get a massage 
a place that could take us to relax  relax  relax 
here s what i m trying to say to you  okay 
don t let fear sabotage letting yourself be happy 
you guys are great together  you re in love 
and love can be very rewarding
and it can be very filling 
very filling 
like a warm stew  it honestly is 
look  if you want ice cream 
go in the car and get ice cream 
you don t worry that   while i m driving 
 hey  i might have some chest pains  
and then   turns out  heart attack 
i m having a heart attack  
you veer off  you kill a bunch of seniors and toddlers 
you get your ice cream 
and you know what  99  of the time  you re
gonna end up at the ice cream shop
with a big hot fudge sundae  nuts 
only one percent of the time do you kill the innocent 
it s pretty good odds 
i m not understanding what you re trying to say to me 
all right  ronny 
tomorrow night is beth s parents  anniversary party 
forty years 
i really think you can learn something from it 
i want you to soak it in 
oh  and  by the way  we did

i thought tonight could be good   cause

all right  i got to run  boon me is waiting 
i just    i wanted to call and let you know
that i ve been thinking about what you were saying
with the curtain and all that stuff 
and i just want to make sure that
i m being fair to you during this 
and that i do realize that there s probably
two sides to every story 
oh  jesus christ 
ronny  you followed him to the massage parlor 
well  no  i just wanted
to call and let you know
that i m sure that not everything
that you re saying is bullshit 
and that if there is complicated things
that are going on  i really hope you guys work on it 
and just so you know  i really don t
want to be in this  geneva 
i know 
it s your shot  come on 
wait  who was that  where are you 
i m at home 
except it s your shot  geneva 
and you don t own a fucking pool table 
ronny  i got to go 
what happened to   i m not gonna see this
guy anymore until after i talk to nick  
good night  ronny 
yeah  good night  princess  just
make sure you re ready
to talk to your husband when
you go home tonight  honey 
because i m definitely going to talk to him 
okay  just take a breath 
besides  i have something you might want
to hear before you go and do that 
what is it 
i ordered you some coffee 
i don t need your goddamn coffee  geneva 
i don t have anything to talk to you about 
i m gonna go see nick tonight 
and i m going to tell him that
his wife is sick and twisted 
and that she s a liar 
and i m going to tell him that he s
married to goddamn helen keller 
helen keller  yeah 
the girl with all the personalities 
sybil 
yeah  sybil 
who are you today  blanche 
how deep do the waters run 
you re a five year old on a playground  ronald 
it s not like i want to go and see zip 
but when my husband calls me to explain
he has another late meeting 
it kind of just flies out the window 
 zip   that s the guy s name  zip 
the point is  ronny  i don t want any of this 
i love my husband 
you got a real funny way of showing that 
stay out of my life 
you re not a therapist 
in fact  you need one  desperately 
look in the mirror  you re 40 years
old  you ve never been married 
go fix yourself and then you can call me 
i don t need to call you  i don t need
to say anything to you anymore 
all i need to do is get out of here and
go tell nick that his wife is cheating 
and i guess  because you weren t able to do
the things that you really said you needed to do
that that s just the way it s going
to have to go down  honey 
you know what  i see it going down
just a little bit differently 
really  yeah 
because i m going to deny it 
and then i m going to say you made a pass at me 
i made a pass at you  yep 
and considering our little secret 
i m pretty sure he ll believe me 
geneva  okay   
we both decided not to say anything
because you liked him  and we didn t
want to ruin something good
over a drunken college night
that happened three months before
you two ever started dating 
but  ronny  he doesn t know that 
it didn t mean anything  geneva 
yeah  well  it means something now  doesn t it 
see  you need to understand how
this is going to play out  ronny 
i m going tell him how we slept
together all those years ago 
and then i m going to say that you
started making passes at me 
and that they never stopped 
you do that 
you sell him that i ve been hitting
on you for 20 years straight 
i should ve told you  nick  i should ve told you sooner 
but ronny insisted that we not say anything 
but as the years went on  it got harder and harder
and i just lied to myself and said it didn t matter 
but i m telling you this now because
ronny has gone crazy 
he s been throwing me up against restaurant walls
right when you re right around the corner 
it s like he wants you to see  he wants to get caught
because he feels so guilty 
but i don t feel safe anymore  nick 
okay 
and this had to come out 
then what are you going to do  ronny 
mr  moral guy 
are you going to look your best friend
in the eyes  and lie to him
and say   no  that never happened 
i never slept with her  
i don t think so 
stay out of my marriage 
now if you ll excuse me 
good night  sybil 
i don t even know if you re there  god 
i haven t really tried to ring you up
ever since i asked for those parlays
when things were tough 
and i know you didn t help me
with those for my own good
because i had stuff i had to learn  but   
i don t want to learn any lessons on this one 
i really don t want to lose my best friend 
i know i m supposed to give you things 
but i m scared to give you this 
if you are listening 
and if you want to help us with
the whole chrysler thing 
that would be really great  too 
if that could go our way  that would be really great 
if you re listening  that s it

ronny  what the   
ron 
get a good feel  buddy

nice to meet you  buddy  my
guy  good to see you  babe

ronald 
yeah  burt and sue 
it s impressive  40 years  it s quite an accomplishment 
is the flame still burning after 40 
still there 
of course it is  of course it is 
with you  there s no question  my man 
let s go celebrate  let s do this 
i m just playing the fun part  doing the things i do 
great to see you 
breath against breath 
breathe me life 
thousand and thousand kisses  give me  i beg you 
love wants everything without condition 
love has no law 
mom and dad 
your love has no law 
so beautiful 
i d like to make the toast 
forty years 
that is a long time to be with
someone  forty years  wow 
it s impressive 
i personally don t know a lot about marriage 
but i would imagine it can t be easy 
all those 40 years being with someone 
because people are not perfect 
people make mistakes in life 
but i would assume
what would get you through those 40 years would be   
   honesty 
honesty and honesty alone 
and love 
but even more than that  burt  is the honesty 
don t forget about patience 
oh  no one s going to forget about patience  sue 
you can relax  patience is on the table 
what i m talking about 
though  is honesty here 
talking about two people
who have probably had an eye
wander every now and then 
everyone knows burt was in the garment business 
if you don t think you meet a
lot of girls in that business 
then you don t get out of the house much 
a lot of girls 
a lot 
good looking guy  well spoken 
it s  pinch me  i m dreaming time   am i right  ladies 
and look at sue  gorgeous lady  easy to be around 
always into the aerobics 
kept it tight  in a great way 
and burt did well  they have
a pool  pool guy come over 
lot of guys would come over to
the house  young guys  too 
now let s say something did happen 
we don t know that it did  maybe it didn t 
but it s not up to us to know  it s up to them to know 
i bet they were honest with each other 
i bet she came to him and said   hey  burt 
 you know you re my number one 
 but maybe mama got thirsty last night  
what i m going to focus on  though 
here is the ingredient
that i think really makes the whole stew
stick together  and that is honesty 
and similar interests 
who are you 
i m cousin betty 
first 
second 
okay  cousin betty  this is not a group toast
nor is it an open forum 
i m the one who s standing up here 
i m the one with the glass  i m the one that is talking 
now  burt and sue chime in
and that s fine because it s their night 
you know  40 years and all of that 
but not you 
nobody gave you a speaking part  nobody cares 
you re a second cousin  which isn t even a real relative
because someone could have sex with a second cousin
and the kid could still be normal 
honesty 
you cannot run from it 
and believe me 
it ll find you 
the truth will always find you 
burt and sue 
forty years  being honest 
burt and sue 
congratulations 
can i speak to you in the kitchen 
i was just going to finish my    please 
sure  okay 
i need to know what s going on 
nothing 
i m just toasting  and i m passionate about honesty 
i m not talking about the inappropriate toast
that you just gave at my parents  anniversary 
or the bar fight 
or the allergies that you caught from
street plants while chasing fat kids 
i m talking about
what s going on in your head
that s causing these things 
it s just some stuff that i have to fix 
that s it  honey  and i can t bring you in on it
because that would directly affect my ability to do that 
to do what  to fix it 
fix it  fix it 
i have to fix it on my own  honey 
okay  ronny  you re not fixing anything
and you re breaking more stuff 
and it s enough 
you just gave a whole speech about honesty 
it s time for you to be honest with me 
is it  yeah 
is it honest time now  between us 
then why don t you start  beth 
why don t you tell me about the kearny group 
how do you know about the kearny group 
are you going to las vegas 
are you planning on leaving me 
god  ronny  no  no 
they asked me to open up a restaurant
in city center  and i said no 
why 
because that would mean i d have to go live
in las vegas for a couple of years 
and   
and what  beth 
and i don t trust you in las vegas 
okay 
ronny   
look at you 
your sponsor called me 
you haven t been going to your meetings 
you re walking around with large amounts of cash 
and it just really feels like two years ago 
you know  i   
i can t get into this with you right now 
if you don t let me in  how do i know what to do 
how can i help you 
i think it s best if i go 
i don t want you to go 
i m going to go sleep at the office tonight 
you want to do this 
what are you doing 
watching you sleep 
it s creepy  right 
felix  go play with the hot tub and
the ladies on the line  honestly 
i m just getting up  it s too much  you re too much 
please  give me a minute  i don t know where i m at 
oh  god  hey  man  what s going on 
come on in the house 
what  are you going to shoot me right here
on your porch in broad daylight 
are you out of your mind 
no  not if you re in the house 
i ve googled this 
do you want to know how it works  yeah 
you come inside and i defend myself 
now  i m not going to pump six bullets into you 
no  that would make me look crazy and out of control 
no  i m going to pump three into you
like a calm gun owner would 
zip  i came here with the intent  and only the intent 
of getting my camera back 
oh  yeah  your camera 
come on inside 
if you just want your camera  it s right here 
listen to me 
i can really appreciate the fact that things got
completely nuts the other night 
and i can also appreciate that a lot of your property   
i appreciate the fact that a lot of your
property got damaged as well 
you killed my fish 
you killed my fish  man  i know 
why would you do that 
maybe you should be compensated for that 
you should be compensated for that 
i can t put a price on that  because that s a friend 
although you can t pet it  but what would the fish do 
the fish doesn t want this  man 
i think what the fish is saying is maybe
i should get my camera back 
and maybe  just maybe  and i m
just hoping against hope here 
maybe we can put this whole thing behind us 
 10 000 
 500 
 5 000 
i have a thousand  i ll give you the thousand 
and an apology 
zip  if i apologize to you when you
have a gun pointed at my throat 
then i don t think it really counts 
that s a good point 
i m sorry for what happened 
i need to feel it 
i just need it to really come from right there 
look  man  i m sorry  all right 
i m sorry  i m really sorry 
i m really  really sorry that we re
standing here in this situation 
i m sorry 
okay 
   seven  eight  nine  10 
and the  400 i owe for the old person s home  perfect 
you did this to me 
you know that 
i don t mess with firearms  i don t do that 
i don t do that  look  i m a sensitive guy 
you know what i m saying to you 
okay 
thank you 
drive safe 
who the hell are you 
you got no choice now 
you got to go right up to him and just say it to him 
it s not that complicated of a thing to do  it s easy 
you got the pictures  she can t bullshit
you  and that s the end of it 
come here  get in here  i love you 
stop it  you will find somebody else 
you re a great guy  and i love you 
just keep walking 
ronny 
hey 
we were just about to call you  actually 
we were hoping to be a little
better prepared  but i guess
we can start 
ronny  why don t you come join us 
who are you 
my name is dr  rosenstone 
your family and friends are here
because they love you  ronald 
and they can t stand to see you
destroy yourself anymore 
what is this  an intervention 
yes 
we don t see the need for labels 
this is just a bunch of friends talking to one friend
and letting them know they love them 
an intervention 
your sister and her husband would like to start 
i tormented you  i know 
diane  please don t do this 
i dressed you up like a little girl 
but i m here to support you 
ronny  i am 
okay  okay  it s not what you think 
i don t know
how the hell you found out 
but i ll kill you if you ever do that to me again 
okay 
why don t we all come in and sit down 
come on 
let ronny sit down 
we got a big blue chair waiting for ronny 
come on  sweetheart  sit down  it ll be okay 
well  it s no coincidence
that we find ourselves here in
a gentle circle of support 
hey 
oh  shit  am i late 
i m sorry  i know it s probably really bad
form to be late to an intervention 
hi  i m beth 
hi  beth  what s going on 
hey  big guy 
who the hell invited him 
you know what  i invited him 
you did  you invited him 
yeah  you know what  i followed
you to his place earlier today 
i saw you pay him 
and after you left  i went up and talked
to him 
it says right here 
 if possible  it s best to have all enablers present 
 even bookies  
so i agreed to pay your debt if he agreed
to come here tonight  and he did 
thanks  man  i appreciate this 
it was really nice of you  no problem 
you got to be kidding me 
he s not my bookie  nick 
oh  come on  ronny 
admit it  man  you bet on everything 
how dare you show up here  you
have no right being here 
he s a scumbag  an enabler  a mistake 
stop it  i asked him to come here 
come on  don t kill the messenger 
i m just here to help  i m helping 
okay  that s what i m doing 
look  he bets on the bulls  and the sox 
the cubs 
he bet on the hawaii game 
only degenerates bet on the hawaii game 
i don t want that for you  man 
i should have done this a long time ago 
i think you need to take a look at this 
what is    you got to look  there s more pictures 
you got to flip through that one 
get to the other pictures 
i did  i m flipping right now 
i keep flipping  and it keeps going back to the same pic
because there s only one picture in the catalogue 
you can t take a picture of something
that didn t happen  ronald 
ronny 
not again 
ronny  calm down 
stop it  you re going to kill him 
you re going to kill your bookie 
he s not my damn bookie 
there s something wrong with you 
you son of a bitch 
what is wrong with you 
you re completely out of control 
you re crazy 
you re completely out of your mind 
don t get me wrong  i d like to party
with you and get high with you 
but you re insane 
i think we re missing the point of this gathering 
it s about talking and sharing our concerns 
this is ridiculous 
then let me go  okay  because
i have something to say 
take a seat  please  everybody  sit 
beth  please  just sit down 
look  here s the thing   
please  just let me    please  okay 
all right 
ah  man  that was   
all right  i got something to say 
this is important to me  so   
okay  nick   
all right  please  please 
i didn t have many friends when i got to ball state 
i was shy and   
you already know this 
but  ronny  what you don t know is
when you moved in across the
hall  in second semester 
i made it a goal of mine
to become friends with you 
i mean  you were funny and charming 
and everybody liked him  everybody 
okay  nick  enough 
you got to let me talk here for a second 
i want you to listen to me 
nick  you re my best friend 
you always make me do better 
you always make sure i don t screw up 
and you make it that i never forget
what really matters in life 
when i had my relapse two years ago 
it wasn t all the money and stuff that
i lost that made me feel bad 
it was the fact that i let you down 
this is good 
this is catharsis 
i know 
you know i never had a brother growing up  right 
and my dad wasn t around very much 
and all my friends growing up were  really  criminals 
so when i met you in school  i was   
let s just say that i looked up
to you as well  in college 
and i really have looked up to you ever since 
so  there s something that you should know 
there s something that i already
should have told you  nick 
what is it 
geneva s been running on you
with the guy that you thought was my bookie 
jesus christ  ronny 
you thought that you saw an exchange  right 
that it was a gambling exchange 
but it wasn t a gambling exchange 
really  i was just going to get my camera 
because there were pictures and stuff on it 
the truth is  i m not gambling 
i haven t been doing any gambling at all 
what s been going on with me is
i ve really been trying to figure out
what s the best way to tell you
and how to handle this thing 
is this true 
no  it s not true 
he s lying 
he s compulsive  he s a gambler 
he ll say anything  he s desperate 
go ahead  geneva  tell him the truth 
everyone is sitting here  listening 
okay  fine  fine 
uh   
the thing is  that   
okay  fine 
what did you expect 
you were getting happy endings in pilsen 
jeez 
no  no  nick  listen 
you left me alone  i wanted to be with you  but   
can we not get into this right now 
no  but that s the problem 
you never want to talk about anything  ever 
i know that it s been tough with us for a while now 
and i take my part in that 
but isn t there something about us you still believe in 
how long did you know 
i ve known for a few days  a week  for way too long 
i don t know what to say  i don t even
know what i m feeling right now 
honestly  i don t know 
i do know this  you should have
told me sooner  ronny 
before right now 
before standing here in front of your friends
and your family  and doctor   
rose    i know it starts
with  rose   rosenstone 
   stone  buddy  i know 
i m really sorry  i tried to tell you in the office 
what do you mean trying  trying is not telling  ronny 
come on  look  i can appreciate
how hard this must have been on you  i know 
i m just really glad that you say that
you can appreciate how hard it was
because you don t even know 
i ve been fighting with these people 
trying to keep everything straight in my head 
i get it 
but in the nature of what s going on here 
there s one more small thing that i
just want to bring closure to now
in the circle of gentleness 
ronny  you don t have to 
yes  i do  geneva 
because nick is my best friend 
and this is what best friends do 
they tell the truth to each other 
okay  when we were in college 
and this is way before you guys ever met 
there was a night that didn t mean anything 
it was a meaningless night 
it was a booze night 
it was big  big bar night 
ronny  get to the point 
the point is  way before you guys ever met 
before you ever even knew each other 
i kind of slept with geneva 
you what 
this is what friends do  they tell the truth 
i m a friend and i m telling the
truth  buddy  here i am 
he wanted to tell you  nick 
but i was falling in love with you 
we didn t want to hurt you 
you asshole  hold on  hold on 
i m telling the truth  i m in a circle 
no  you know what  you re the worst 
buddy  i m sorry  okay  listen   
get your hands off me  don t touch me 
let me tell you something 
that s probably the most honest
thing you ve ever said to me 
nick    you re sorry 
you re so sorry 
nick 
i m sorry  ronny 
i m sorry 
i should never have put you in that position 
beth  i am so sorry that i caused
tension between you two 
i m sorry 
this has been a marvelous first step 
i m sorry 
this has been a revelation for you  i can tell 
i m okay  buddy  thank you 
you ve done a lot here today 
i didn t gamble 
i walked by the casino once or
twice  but i didn t gamble 
are you okay 
it s been a long day 
i didn t know if you had eaten or not  so 
if you re hungry   
i don t know how to start this 
i got scared 
and i m sorry 
because i didn t feel safe 
so then  i didn t tell you about las
vegas and the kearny group 
and then  here i am  being someone
that i don t want to be 
i mean  i staged this whole
ridiculous intervention thing
and you weren t even gambling 
and that s great  by the way 
i m so happy that you weren t gambling 
but this is no good 
it s not healthy 
the problem is  if you don t share stuff with me 
like the fact that you were with geneva 
it keeps me in the dark 
and that belittles us 
i want us to be more than that 
i understand 
i just didn t feel right in saying something to you
if i wasn t saying it to nick 
and then  when i found out
about the vegas deal
and that you didn t trust me enough
to share that with me 
then that really hurt 
but i guess i ve earned that 
and it s up to me to un earn that 
i don t ever want to put you through
anything like this ever again 
because honestly  honey  i do love you 
i love you  too 
and   
i understand 
you ve got a chrysler meeting tomorrow  don t you 
i don t even know if nick is going to show up 
you weren t a terrible friend  ronny 
i mean  you sucked at the way you handled things 
but you cared 
yes 
ronny valentine 
the other half of the team 
i ll let the gang know  tell them you re both here 
thank you  i appreciate that 
how are you doing 
well  i moved out 
how are you feeling 
shaky
on how everything went down 
the truth is  i was just
hanging on to something that wasn t there 
it wasn t fair to her 
i m sorry  buddy 
i m sorry you re going through this  nick 
listen  i feel terrible about the whole situation 
and i ve been sick to my stomach
for the last 24 hours  man 
i ve been doing a lot of soul searching
and thinking about
what friendship really means 
and the thing of it is   
there it is 
okay  good  that s good 
nick  i feel terrible about this whole thing  all right 
and if that makes you feel better 
for me  honestly  i just want
to get past this thing  okay 
so  if you want to hit me again   
ow 
oh  my god 
is everything all right 
great 
we re ready for you 
we ll be just one sec  we re ready  we ll come right in 
well  we ll be in the presentation area 
i know where it is  i ll be right there 
good grief 
we re really looking forward to this opportunity 
you handled this whole thing like shit 
i m sorry  nick 
i really am 
i know i didn t date a lot 
so when geneva and i were serious 
you didn t want to hurt me 
and it was before we ever got together 
now i m not saying it was easy 
the spot you were in  because it wasn t 
but in the future 
no matter how uncomfortable things are 
if it affects us 
you got to tell me 
do you got it 
i promise you  nick 
i got it 
okay 
all right  there you go 
i m good 
excuse me  mr  valentine 
given what we just saw in the waiting
room  i think we need to   
oh  that  we re like kids in a
car too long on a road trip 
we re fine  we re just working 
the moment of truth
has finally arrived 
now i know that the journey getting
here has had some turbulence
and some confusion 
but i ask you for one second 
when folks were reaching for greatness 
was that not the case 
i remember a group of people
who wanted to head west
with dreams of gold and opportunity 
the donner party 
the donner pass 
things got a little weird out on the trail  didn t it 
some cannibalism  folks got hungry 
some feelings hurt  some families destroyed 
but some people made it out west 
not all of them 
and it s not that they necessarily got rich 
but the point is 
we ve headed out west  and this is our destination 
nick 
start your engine 
you son of a bitch 
i told you the difference was nick brannen 
and we have nick brannen 
simply the best 
you can feel it 
better than all the rest 
you were right about these lunatics  susan 
commit to the long term deal and cut them a check 
and that s why i love you guys 
that s why i love you 
that s why my lady wood is still strong 
see  i get it  they don t get it 
they don t get it  but i do 
see  all that fighting and shit  that s just passion 
when you work that close  you just want to choke
the hell out of somebody  right 
yeah  see  i understand that 
i relate  but  listen 
that motor   
that motor in that car   
i mean  when it started vibrating    i m sorry 
if i was sitting on the hood of that car    okay 
   and the way it was just vibrating   
i understand  and i got to be really honest with you 
when i first met you  your phraseology
with  lady wood  
i didn t know whether you were coming or going 
but i ve really grown to love you 
yes  yes  come on  come on 
damn it 
he can do this  he just has to stay calm 
nick brannen  that was your second shot 
but if you score on your third and final attempt 
you can still win a trip for two

okay  good luck 
dude  seats are taken 
it s between periods
