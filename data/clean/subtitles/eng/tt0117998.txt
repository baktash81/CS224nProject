christ 
the suck zone 
it s the point   
   basically at which the twister   
   sucks you up 
that s not the technical
term for it  obviously 
i m jo harding 
nice to meet you 
bill told me the happy news 
 which 
 us  marriage  jo  melissa 
it s happy news 
i guess it seems sudden 
sudden 
dude  you re taking the vows 
that s sweet 
we wanted to get it done before
billy started his new job 
that s right  weatherman 
what 
 don t say it 
 i said  weatherman 
 it s great 
 you have that tone 
if you have a problem  
i don t have a problem
being a weatherman 
dr  melissa reeves 
very nice to meet you 
you too 
new truck 
that s right 
boy  oh  boy  new job   
   new truck   
   new wife  it s a whole new you 
this is awkward 
tell me 
i thought you d come alone 
you said you d meet me  
it s about dorothy 
dorothy 
what about her 
she s here 
show me 
i can t believe you did it 
we built 4 
she work 
thought you d want to be
here for her first time out 
it wouldn t be right
if you weren t here 
this is going to be good 
how sweet is that 
it s bill s concept 
the extreme  it came from his brain 
i had a hand in it 
it is great 
what is it 
it s an instrument pack for studying
tornados  first one in history 
it s very exciting 
scientists have studied
tornados forever   
   but nobody knows
how a tornado works 
we don t know what happens inside   
   because nobody can take
measurements inside the funnel 
that s what she s going to do 
how 
we put her up inside a tornado 
she opens   
   and releases hundreds
of these sensors   
   that measure all parts of
the tornado simultaneously 
you see  it s like this 
these sensors go up the funnel
and radio back information   
   about the internal structure 
wind velocities    
we ll learn more in 30 seconds
than in the last 30 years 
get a profile for the first time 
what will that do 
if we know how tornados work 
we can design a warning system 
aren t there warnings already 
 the civil defence  
 they re not good enough 
right now it s 3 minutes 
if we can get this information 
we can increase it to 15 
give people a chance to get to safety 
that s what they re trying to do 
i can t believe you did it 
well  we did it 
how do you get it in 
you get in front of it and
put it in the damage path 
and then get out again quickly 
that s the suck zone 
excellent  we got major action 
n s s l  says the cap is breaking 
towers are going up 30 miles 
let s go 
we re moving 
it s fatty time 
laptop 
we re waiting  let s go 
joey  haynes  a little help 
smooth 
there s dusty 
come on  you re always last 
let s go 
we re going third  preacher follow 
get the camera 
i got it 
they can handle this 
they know what they re doing 
this is what they do 
they live for this 
dorothy 2   3 ready 
dorothy 4 ready 
sure you don t want to go 
go with them 
no  they ll be fine 
 did she sign the papers 
 shit 
she didn t 
hurry  we can catch them 
glad you re back 
i m not back 
rabbit 
yeah  boss 
can we do better than the 30 
not for a while  it s best to stay
on it until we pass the creek 
copy that 
once we catch up to them 
take the truck and go home 
i ll get them signed  see you tonight 
this is interesting 
i m going to tag along 
jonas  son of a bitch 
who is that 
jonas miller  he s a night crawler 
we all started out in the same lab  then
jonas got himself corporate sponsors 
he s in it for the money 
not the science 
he s got a lot of high tech gadgets 
but he s got no instincts 
and he doesn t have dorothy 
i think we have fleas 
jo  come back 
you change your mind 
yeah  why s jonas here 
i m not sure 
i bet he s asking himself
the same thing about you 
shit  hold on 
god damn  son of a bitch 
this essentially was a false alarm 
the radar appeared solid 
 how long till it s fixed 
 10 minutes  15 tops 
sounds good 
what drives me is the unknown 
what if we could predict
the tornado s path 
how many lives would be spared
by an early warning system 
and d o t  3   
   is the answer 
the first digital
orthographic telemeter 
inside  she holds hundreds
of these sensors which   
   when released into the tornado 
transmit back data on wind speed   
   pressure and dew point temperature 
why didn t you tell me 
don t 
and what will soon be the
center for all studies 
you shit 
think i wouldn t find out  
get him off me 
what s wrong 
what s the matter 
you stole my design  you bastard 
what do you mean  
dorothy  you took her  you damn thief 
oh  i get it  you want to
take credit for my design 
you re a liar 
she was our idea 
unrealised idea 
unrealised 
that ain t worth shit unless it flies 
guys  guys  all my guys 
get a grip on yourself 
we both know he ll never
get it up in the air 
well  let me enlighten you people 
this baby has satellite comlink 
we got on board pulse doppler 
we got nexrad real time 
we re going to make history 
so stick around 
the days of sniffing the dirt are over 
better than what you sniff 
we ll see who gets there first  pal 
by the way   
   l really enjoy your weather reports 
you slime 
come here 
get off 
he s a corporate kiss butt 
i m sorry  i should have told you 
one day 
i ll give you one day 
whether she flies or not  i m gone

90 knots  50 outbound  40 inbound 
we see a very pronounced hook 
checking for you now 
we re getting south east
gusts at 40 miles per hour 
approaching 150 in the funnel 
storm motion is 225 degrees
out of the south west 
we re in position  proceed 
howdy 
must admire their spirit 
there s your pal 
what re you doing

it s all right  come on  it s okay 
no  i m not okay  this is not okay 
oh  christ  i m sorry 
honey  i didn t think 
when you used to tell me
that you chased tornados   
   deep down i always
thought it was a metaphor 
it s okay  it s okay 
three times a lady 
did you see the inflow jets 
see   i was in the middle of it 
i m thinking it might not
be too bad of an idea   
   if we left  because there
was too many tornados there 
are you kidding  this thing s not over 
we ve only seen the start 
you know   
   we re close to wakita 
aunt meg wouldn t mind a pit stop 
we crave sustenance 
guys  we are not invading my aunt

food 
we re absolutely not going 
there s the spot  just do it 
great 
come on  honey 
come on 
you must meet her  she s great 
meg  how are you

shower s free 
i m next 
i want that 
how can you watch this garbage 
pardon me  you must see this 
like for you to be out
there chasing tornados 
it s a thrill 
man vs  nature  battling the elements 
what a weasel 
as a scientist  can you
actually predict tornados now 
no  they re unpredictable   
   as my unfortunate
colleagues found out today 
but we hope to change all that
with a system i have devised 
god  he sucks 
shut up 
turn him off 
what a wiener 
he s so in love with himself 
i thought it was a summer thing 
he ll rue the day 
he ll rue the day he came
up against the extreme 
 hear  hear 
 amen  baby 
bill  i m talking imminent rue age 
imminent rue age 
i was just wondering  why do
you call billy  the extreme  
 cause billy is the extreme 
bill s the most out of controllest
bastard in the game 
no  i think i came in second 
i ve seen him in high gear 
you guys must get new stories 
i ll go clean up 
so   
   we get this one near daleton 
god 
we re close and jo s got the vid on it 
she s filming it 
suddenly  this shitty looking green
valiant pulls up right in the way 
she starts yelling and this   
   loser stumbles out of the car 
he s got a bottle of jack daniels 
he s naked 
he s butt naked 
not naked 
i was not naked 
he s without apparel 
half naked 
naked  so  jo s yelling at him
to get out of the way  right 
so   
   he just strolls up to the twister   
   and says   have a drink  
and he chucks the bottle
into the twister and   
   it never hits the ground 
twister caught it  sucked it right up 
honey  this is a tissue of lies 
there was another bill   
   an evil bill   
   and i killed him 
i love him 
that was a good size twister 
what was that  an f 3 
f 2 
i m lost again 
it s the fujita scale  it measures a
tornado s intensity by how much it eats 
eats 
destroys 
that encounter we had was
a strong f 2  f 3  maybe 
we ll see f 4 s today 
that d be sweet 
four is good  four would
relocate your house efficiently 
is there an f 5 
what would that be like 
the finger of god 
none of you has seen an f 5 
just one of us 
forget it 
doesn t matter what you do   
   you ll still be beautiful 
you re biased 
yes  i am 
sounds like old times 
yes  it does 
he didn t keep his part of the bargain 
which part 
to spend his life pining for you
and die miserable and alone 
that so much to ask 
i don t know 
bill always went his own way 
usually the same way you were going 
seems like a long time ago 
not so long  jo 
he s here  isn t he 
that is so beautiful 
we got one 
f 3  mile outside of parlaine
