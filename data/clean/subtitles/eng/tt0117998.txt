thats not the technical
term for it obviously
im jo harding
nice to meet you
bill told me the happy news
which
us marriage jo melissa
its happy news
i guess it seems sudden
sudden
dude youre taking the vows
thats sweet
we wanted to get it done before
billy started his new job
thats right weatherman
what
dont say it
i said weatherman
its great
you have that tone
if you have a problem
i dont have a problem
being a weatherman
dr melissa reeves
very nice to meet you
you too
new truck
thats right
boy oh boy new job
new truck
new wife its a whole new you
this is awkward
tell me
i thought youd come alone
you said youd meet me
its about dorothy
dorothy
what about her
shes here
show me
i cant believe you did it
we built 4
she work
thought youd want to be
here for her first time out
it wouldnt be right
if you werent here
this is going to be good
how sweet is that
its bills concept
the extreme it came from his brain
i had a hand in it
it is great
what is it
its an instrument pack for studying
tornados first one in history
its very exciting
scientists have studied
tornados forever
but nobody knows
how a tornado works
we dont know what happens inside
because nobody can take
measurements inside the funnel
thats what shes going to do
how
we put her up inside a tornado
she opens
and releases hundreds
of these sensors
that measure all parts of
the tornado simultaneously
you see its like this
these sensors go up the funnel
and radio back information
about the internal structure
wind velocities
well learn more in 30 seconds
than in the last 30 years
get a profile for the first time
what will that do
if we know how tornados work
we can design a warning system
arent there warnings already
the civil defence
theyre not good enough
right now its 3 minutes
if we can get this information
we can increase it to 15
give people a chance to get to safety
thats what theyre trying to do
i cant believe you did it
well we did it
how do you get it in
you get in front of it and
put it in the damage path
and then get out again quickly
thats the suck zone
excellent we got major action
nssl says the cap is breaking
towers are going up 30 miles
lets go
were moving
its fatty time
laptop
were waiting lets go
joey haynes a little help
smooth
theres dusty
come on youre always last
lets go
were going third preacher follow
get the camera
i got it
they can handle this
they know what theyre doing
this is what they do
they live for this
dorothy 2  3 ready
dorothy 4 ready
sure you dont want to go
go with them
no theyll be fine
did she sign the papers
shit
she didnt
hurry we can catch them
glad youre back
im not back
rabbit
yeah boss
can we do better than the 30
not for a while its best to stay
on it until we pass the creek
copy that
once we catch up to them
take the truck and go home
ill get them signed see you tonight
this is interesting
im going to tag along
jonas sonofabitch
who is that
jonas miller hes a night crawler
we all started out in the same lab then
jonas got himself corporate sponsors
hes in it for the money
not the science
hes got a lot of hightech gadgets
but hes got no instincts
and he doesnt have dorothy
i think we have fleas
jo come back
you change your mind
yeah whys jonas here
im not sure
i bet hes asking himself
the same thing about you
shit hold on
god damn sonofabitch
this essentially was a false alarm
the radar appeared solid
how long till its fixed
10 minutes 15 tops
sounds good
what drives me is the unknown
what if we could predict
the tornados path
how many lives would be spared
by an early warning system
and dot 3
is the answer
the first digital
orthographic telemeter
inside she holds hundreds
of these sensors which
when released into the tornado
transmit back data on wind speed
pressure and dew point temperature
why didnt you tell me
dont
and what will soon be the
center for all studies
you shit
think i wouldnt find out
get him off me
whats wrong
whats the matter
you stole my design you bastard
what do you mean
dorothy you took her you damn thief
oh i get it you want to
take credit for my design
youre a liar
she was our idea
unrealised idea
unrealised
that aint worth shit unless it flies
guys guys all my guys
get a grip on yourself
we both know hell never
get it up in the air
well let me enlighten you people
this baby has satellite comlink
we got onboard pulse doppler
we got nexrad real time
were going to make history
so stick around
the days of sniffing the dirt are over
better than what you sniff
well see who gets there first pal
by the way
l really enjoy your weather reports
you slime
come here
get off
hes a corporate kissbutt

its a thrill
man vs nature battling the elements
what a weasel
as a scientist can you
actually predict tornados now
no theyre unpredictable
as my unfortunate
colleagues found out today
but we hope to change all that
with a system i have devised
god he sucks
shut up
turn him off
what a wiener
hes so in love with himself
i thought it was a summer thing
hell rue the day
hell rue the day he came
up against the extreme
hear hear
amen baby
bill im talking imminent rueage
imminent rueage
i was just wondering why do
you call billy the extreme
cause billy is the extreme
bills the most outofcontrollest
bastard in the game

ive seen him in high gear
you guys must get new stories
ill go clean up
so
we get this one near daleton
god
were close and jos got the vid on it

she starts yelling and this
loser stumbles out of the car
hes got a bottle of jack daniels
hes naked
hes buttnaked
not naked
i was not naked
hes without apparel
halfnaked
naked so jos yelling at him
to get out of the way right
so
he just strolls up to the twister
and says have a drink
and he chucks the bottle
into the twister and
it never hits the ground
twister caught it sucked it right up
honey this is a tissue of lies
there was another bill
an evil bill
and i killed him
i love him
that was a goodsize twister
what was that an f3
f2
im lost again
its the fujita scale it measures a
tornados intensity by how much it eats
eats
destroys
that encounter we had was
a strong f2 f3 maybe
well see f4s today
thatd be sweet
four is good four would
relocate your house efficiently
is there an f5
what would that be like
the finger of god
none of you has seen an f5
just one of us
forget it
doesnt matter what you do
youll still be beautiful
youre biased
