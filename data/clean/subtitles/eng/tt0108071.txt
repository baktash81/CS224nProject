   and lonely in india 
i didn t like it 
nobody but my servant   
   my ayah  looked after me 
my parents didn t want me 
my mother cared only to go to parties   
   and my fa ther was busy
with his military duties 
i was never allowed to go to the parties 
i watched them
from my mother s bedroom window 
i was angry  but i never cried 
i didn t know how to cry 
 i left my fan  you didn t have to come 
 i wanted to 
my parents always thought
about themselves 
they never thought about me 
if only i could ve known   
   that in a few moments
i would lose them forever

yes  mary lennox 
i ve come to claim her 
i m mrs  medlock 
housekeeper of misslethwaite manor   
   for the lord archibald craven   
   her uncle and guardian 
what a queer  unresponsive little thing 
and  my word  a plain piece of quince 
her mother was a beauty 
she certainly didn t hand much of it down 
she might improve as she gets older 
children change 
she ll have to change quite a bit 
there s not much to improve her
at misslethwaite manor 
come along 
it s a pity for you that
you haven t any other place to go 
your uncle won t trouble himself
about you 
that s for sure 
he never troubles himself about anyone 
as if having a crooked back   
   wasn t cross enough for a man to bear 
but she had to up and die on him 
your aunt is dead 
didn t your mother tell you 
strange 
not telling you that
her own twin sister was dead 
my mother didn t have the time
to tell me stories 
oh  at last 
there s misslethwaite 
you ll go straight to bed for a few hours 
you probably haven t gotten much rest 
there s your breakfast 
i m still in my nightgown 
you can change after you eat 
there are new clothes in the wardrobe 
who ll dress me 
you can t dress yourself 
of course not  my ayah dressed me 
nonsense 
as old as you are 
what do they do with children in india 
carry you around in a basket 
how dare you talk to me
with such disrespect 
nobody s going to carry you
around misslethwaite manor 
we ve far too much work already 
so you ll have to look after yourself 
there are 100 rooms here 
this one and no other is yours 
don t expect to see your uncle
because it s certain you won t 
you are not to touch anything 
or to go wandering and poking about 
the house seemed dead   
   like a spell had been cast upon it 
it lookedjust like my mother s room 
this must have been my aunt s 
the dressing tables were the same 
they even had twin ivory elephants 
mother 
what are you doing  what did i tell you 
i heard someone crying 
dogs 
no  someone  a person crying 
you heard nothing of the sort 
now   
   you stay where you are told 
or i ll come and box your ears 
good afternoon 
i brought you something to eat 
you haven t touched your porridge 
didn t you want it 
are you my servant 
i m mrs  medlock s servant 
she s lord craven s 
but i ll be doing the housemaid s work
up here and waiting on you a bit 
waiting on me makes you my servant then 
you are strange 
hey  i know that 
mrs  medlock gave me the place
out of kindness to me mother 
she said she could never have done it
if there was a grand missus here 
i d never be let out of the kitchens   
   and certainly not upstairs 
stop it 
what re you doing 
i thought all girls liked to be tickled 
what would you like to wear 
black   
   black or black 
are you blind 
they re all black 
and i won t be laughed at  servant 
my name s martha 
i won t tickle you  i promise 
what do they wear in india 
when i heard you were coming 
i thought you d be a native 
what 
you thought i was a what  you    
you    
you daughter of a pig 
you needn t be like that 
i ve nothing against natives 
my mother says all of us are family 
i ve never seen a native 
i was pleased to think i was 
you don t know anything about anything 
none of you know nothing 
please 
don t be vexed 
i don t know anything about anything   
   like you said 
i m sorry  miss 
i m too common and i talk too much 
i beg your pardon  miss 
i don t know when exactly
your uncle will call for you 
my uncle 
mrs  medlock said
he wouldn t want to see me 
but he does 
your uncle s decided not to see you today 
when will i see him 
tomorrow 
no  he ll be gone tomorrow 
after the mistress died ten years ago   
   lord craven wouldn t see people 
there s nobody to ease his sorrow 
he spends most of his time
away from home now 
poor man 
they say he s cursed 
better put your sweater on 
it s cold outside 
but i ve got no one to play with 
no one to play with 
let me out of here 
dickon  my brother   
   goes up on the moor
by himself for hours 
that s how he made friends
with all his animals 
who 
dickon   
   me younger brother 
pull it down 
you have no idea
how curious he is about you 
what do you think you re doing 
there you are 
i wondered where you d gone

you knew perfectly well where i was 
your scarf  miss

thou is ready to go out now 
i can t see 
to get to the gardens

   then around the outside of the house 
run along now  have fun 
what s beyond there 
another garden 
where s the door

 where s the door to that other garden 
 what 
the one with all the ivy 
i didn t see a door 
there isn t one 
there has to be a door somewhere 
no one s been inside that place
for ten years 
why 
why 
because when she died  the master
gave orders to shut it up forever 
who died 
my aunt died 
it was her garden  wasn t it 
look at me 
answer me  you 
it s revolting how these people
behave toward me 
of course   
   orders couldn t keep him out 
he s the only one goes in there nowadays 
if you know the way   
   show me 
who s there 
he hates it 
why does lord craven hate her garden 
 we re not supposed to talk about it 
 why not 
i ve got a present for you 
mother sent it over to you 
what s it for 
you mean  all they ve got is
elephants and tigers in india 
they ve not got skipping ropes

she s had a toothache all morning 
i need your help  come on

there ll be so many roses
in there this summer   
   you ll be sick of them 
look 
there s a picture of my mother
and my aunt sitting here 
they say that s how she died 
how 
from falling off it 
for the first time since coming from india   
   i dreamed about my mother 
she was here   
   in the garden   
   and the garden was ajungle 
come to me 
are you a ghost

how old are you

we re the same age 
what s your mother like 
she s dead 
mine s dead  too 
do you see that cord 
pull it 
that s my mother 
my father never wants to see me
because   
   i don t look anything like her 
but you  you look like her 
why do you keep a curtain over her 
she smiles too much 
smiles too much 
how can anybody smile too much 
sometimes i hate her 
 she died when i was born 
 i thought she died in her garden 
garden 
what garden 
oh  just a garden 
there are so many of them here 
 are there 
 of course 
don t you go outside 
never 
what s wrong with you 
i m going to die 
from what 
everything 
i ve spent my whole life in this bed 
you don t know how to walk 
you are real 
my dreams are so real sometimes 
shall i pinch you to prove it 
see 
how did you know to pull the weeds 
it looked like it was strangling 
i don t even know what it is 
a lily  it s an empress of india lily 
empress of india 
these bulbs are lilies  too 
we ll plant them all around your lily 
she ll have her own ladies in waiting 
it s just like the rhyme 
  mistress mary  quite contrary
  how does your garden grow 
  with silver bells and cockleshells
  and pretty maids all in a row   
on the boat coming here 
they used to sing that song at me 
i wasn t as contrary as they were 
i met my cousin last night 
you ve seen colin 
did you know about him 
everybody knows about him 
but hardly anybody s seen him 
he said his mother died when he was born 
she fell off the swing 
he was born too soon 
he s not at all like you 
his cheeks are whiter than ice and marble 
whiter than these little hairs 
those are the roots 
set it in there 
let it grow this way  miss mary 
how tiresome to be shut indoors 
it s too stuffy 
i ll faint if i don t get
some light and fresh air 
at least we can open the windows 
no  get away from there 
don t touch them 
they re nailed shut 
my lungs can t take the spores 
spores 
the wind carries them  when you
breathe the air  you swallow them 
they get stuck in your lungs 
before i got out into the wind 
even my hair was scrawny 
your hair 
 hair is dead 
 if hair is dead   
   then how come it keeps growing
even after you die 
well  maybe not your hair 
by then you might be bald 
don t be stupid 
i ll be dead before i m old enough
to be bald 
i ll get a lump on my back like my father 
then i ll die 
i hate how you talk about dying 
everyone thinks i ll die 
if everyone thought that about me 
i wouldn t do it 
here 
put this on 
everyone has to wear one 
medlock s orders 
 but she s not here to see me 
 put it on 
it makes my face itch 
i can t stand it 
i didn t give you any germs last night 
put on the mask 
stop talking to me as if you were a rajah
with jewels stuck all over you 
i ll talk to you any way i please 
where are you going 
back outside to be with dickon 
he tames animals like the animal charmers
in india 
he knows everything about gardens 
does he know about my mother s garden 
 what 
 you said my mother had a garden 
how would he know about it 
it s locked  no one s allowed in there 
 i ll make them unlock it 
 no  don t do that 
why not 
if you make them open the door like that 
if everyone knows   
   it wouldn t be a secret anymore 
don t you see how much better it is
if it s a secret 
you have to 
maybe you can t even keep a secret 
master colin  we ve brought the machine
for your legs 
i don t want it 
now  don t be like that 
you know how important it is
for your circulation 
i ve got some nice  fresh flannels  too 
your father returns today 
he won t want to see me 
perhaps he will 
the machine  wake up  girl 
oh  i forgot my herbs 
 i ll get them for you 
 no  thank you 
last time  you brought too many roots
and almost no leaves 
what are you doing down there 
miss mary 
where s your mask 
if mrs  medlock finds out    
the world s coming to an end 
she won t let you come back 
but you re master until your father
gets home  you could make her  
go  just go 
she ll think i disobeyed her 
she ll fire me for sure 
please  go 
his lordship s arrived  he s here 
come along  miss mary 
come along 
miss mary  your lordship 
calm down 
come here 
you needn t be afraid 
come here 
my god 
your eyes 
they re so much    
i had no idea 
wait a moment 
they never sent me your picture 
mother had no time
to get my picture taken 
medlock wants me to send you
to some sort of boarding school 
please  let me stay 
i don t do any harm 
harm 
what harm could you do 
there s nothing for a child here 
i don t need much 
all i need is    
could i    
could i have a bit of earth 
bit of earth 
to plant seeds in 
to make things grow 
take your bit of earth 
don t be foolish and expect anything
to come of it 
may i take it from anywhere
so long as it s not wanted 
anywhere 
well     go  go 
you can go 
good bye  good bye 
i ll be away until the winter 
he said i can 
i can have my bit of earth 
who said 
my uncle  i asked him and he said   yes   
i can plant seeds anywhere i like 
blue flowers  pink flowers   
   purple flowers  yellow flowers   
   cornflowers  foxgloves 
any kind we want 
it s raining 
the rain will help our flowers grow 
in india when it rained 
my ayah would tell me stories 
in one of the stories there was a god
who reminds me of you 
when he was growing up   
   he had to be kept a secret 
so no one would see him 
really 
 why 
 because his uncle wanted to kill him 
his uncle dreamed the young god
would take over heaven 
 where did he hide 
 he lived with some cows 
was he different from other people 
only on the inside 
when you looked down his throat
you could see the universe 
the universe couldn t fit
down anybody s throat 
down his it could 
how 
he d have to be bigger than the whole
universe to fit it down his throat 
you said he looked like everybody else
on the outside 
that s right  it s inside
that he was different 
 it doesn t make sense 
 it doesn t have to make sense 
it s the idea of it 
it s so stupid 
 no  it s not  it s magic 
 you can t be that stupid 
i am not stupid 
you don t understand  you don t want to 
you can t leave 
you wouldn t dare 
wouldn t i 
 i ll have them drag you back in 
 will you  mr  rajah 
fine 
that s just fine 
then i won t even look at you 
i ll stare at the floor 
i ll clench my teeth together
and never tell you one thing 
not even about seeing your father 
yes  you will 
tell me 
he didn t come to see me 
i ll die  cause he doesn t like me 
he likes me 
but he s my father 
maybe if you weren t so rude 
i m not rude 
yes  you are  you re so sour 
you won t even open your windows
and let the sunshine in 
how can i  it s raining out 
 even if it weren t raining 
 if it weren t raining  maybe i would 
 you never have 
 does that mean i never would 
i m not sour 
will he ever see colin 
 he s afraid to fall in love with him 
 he s afraid to love his son 
sometimes when he s here 
he stays alone for a week 
but colin wants to see him 
sometimes  he stays longer 
longer than a week 
ten years ago   
   when his wife died 
he locked himself in for over a month 
colin was such a weak baby 
everyone thought he d die 
his father couldn t bear losing him  too 
he d suffered so much already 
my poor little boy 
that was the night the rain stopped 
the night spring came to misslethwaite 
my poor uncle fled from it   
   as if he were escaping the spring 
medlock s gone

i couldn t trust you

baby animals are being born 
i m going out in my chair 
if the fresh air agrees with me   
   i may go out every day

may think  you re still under my care 
your father trusts me to do what is best
for you  and that s what i will do 
god  look at your legs 
they re all swollen and red 
come on  will 
if i m so sick 
you should send for my father 
you are to stay in bed 
you are not to go out into the gardens 
give me the address and i ll write to him 
you ll do no such thing 
give it to me 
i ve had enough 
between the wretched girl
and the dangers of the fresh air   
   heaven knows what s happened to you 
you could be clotting 
she probably turned your chair over 
i won t stand for it  not anymore 
i won t stand for any of it  come on  john 
i m keeping you children apart 
he is a very ill little boy 
i ve worked too hard and too long
to keep him alive   
   to have him killed by one pig headed 
meddlesome little girl like you 
come on 
it s safe 
everybody s gone 
ben s waiting at the gate 
thank you 
we re making magic here 
when i grow up 
i ll make great discoveries 
and this is my first experiment 
aye

  set his spirit free
  oh  great magic

  oh  great magic

thank you 
should we call colin 
what s happening

oh  look

my uncle learned to laugh 
and i learned to cry 
the secret garden is always open now 
open   
   and awake and alive
