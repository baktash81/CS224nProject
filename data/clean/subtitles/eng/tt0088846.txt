we stood beneath
an amber moon
and softly murmured
someday soon
someday
wed kiss
wed kiss
central services
we do the work
you do the pleasure
hi there
i want talk to you about ducts
do your ducts seem oldfashioned
outofdate
central servicess new duct designs
are now available
in hundreds of different colors
to suit your individual taste
hurry now while stocks last
to your nearest central services showroom
designer colors to suit
your demanding taste
tonight we have with us
from the ministry of information
deputy minister eugene helpmann
good evening david
what do you believe is behind
this recent increase in terrorist bombings
bad sportsmanship
a ruthless minority of people
seems to have forgotten certain
good oldfashioned virtues
they just cant stand
seeing the other fella win
if these people
would just play the game
theyd get a lot more out of life
nevertheless mr helpmann
there are those who maintain
that the ministry of information
has become too large and unwieldy
david in a free society
informations the name of the game
you cant win the game
ifyoure a man short
and the cost of it all deputy minister
seven percent of the gross national product
i understand this concern
on behalf of the taxpayer
people want value for money
thats why we always insist on the principle
of information retrieval charges
its absolutely right and fair
that those found guilty should pay
for their periods of detention
and for the information retrieval
procedures used in their interrogation
do you bel ieve that the government
is winning the battle against terrorists
oh yes our morale
is m uch higher than theirs
were fielding all theirstrokes
running a lot ofthem out
and pretty consistently
knocking them for six
id say theyre nearly out ofthe game
lawabiding citizens
to have to subsidize criminals
but mr helpmann the bombing campaign
is now in its 1 3th year
beginners luck
thank you very much
deputy minister
thank you david
and a very merry christmas
to you all
scrooge was better than his word
he did it all and infinitely more
and to tiny tim who did not die
he became a second father
he became as good a friend
in the good old world
and so as tiny tim observed

its been confusion
from the word go
hes been overcharged for
information retrieval procedures
and someone somewhere
is trying to make us carry the can
can i have a look
i ve never seen a refund check before
i ll bet its jeffries
yes
he always believes that people should
pay more for their interrogation
and  b he loathes me
weve gotta get rid of it
well send it to somebody else
better still send it to buttle
after all its his check
ive tried that
but look look at this
you see the population census
has gotten him down as dormanted
uh the central collective storehouse computer
has got him down as deleted
hang on
information retrieval
has got him down as inoperative
security has got him down as excised
administration has him down as completed
hes dead
le
dead
well thats awful
well never get rid
of the damn thing now
what we gonna do sam
could try next of kin
next of kin
