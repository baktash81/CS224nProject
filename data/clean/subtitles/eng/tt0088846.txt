  we stood beneath
an amber moon  
  and softly murmured
someday soon  
    someday  
    we d kiss  
  we d kiss  
  central services  
  we do the work
you do the pleasure  
hi there 
i want talk to you about ducts 
do your ducts seem old fashioned 
out of date 
central services s new duct designs   
are now available
in hundreds of different colors   
to suit your individual taste 
hurry now  while stocks last 
to your nearest central services showroom 
designer colors to suit
your demanding taste 
tonight we have with us 
from the ministry of information   
deputy minister eugene helpmann 
good evening  david 
what do you believe is behind
this recent increase in terrorist bombings 
bad sportsmanship 
a ruthless minority of people   
seems to have forgotten certain
good old fashioned virtues 
they just can t stand
seeing the other fella win 
if these people
would just play the game   
they d get a lot more out of life 
nevertheless  mr  helpmann 
there are those who maintain   
that the ministry of information
has become too large and unwieldy 
david  in a free society 
information s the name of the game 
you can t win the game
ifyou re a man short 
and the cost of it all  deputy minister 
seven percent of the gross national product 
i understand this concern
on behalf of the taxpayer 
people want value for money 
that s why we always insist on the principle
of information retrieval charges 
  it s absolutely right and fair   
that those found guilty should pay
for their periods of detention   
and for the information retrieval
procedures used in their interrogation 
do you bel ieve that the government
is winning the battle against terrorists 
oh  yes  our morale
is m uch higher than theirs 
we re fielding all theirstrokes 
running a lot ofthem out   
and pretty consistently
knocking them for six 
i d say they re nearly out ofthe game 
   law abiding citizens
to have to subsidize criminals 
but  mr  helpmann  the bombing campaign
is now in its 1 3th year 
beginner s luck 
thank you very much 
deputy minister 
thank you  david 
and a very merry christmas
to you all 
 scrooge was better than his word 
 he did it all  and infinitely more 
   and to tiny tim  who did not die   
  he became a second father 
  he became as good a friend
in the good old world 
 and so  as tiny tim observed

  tuttle 
  mm hmm 
no  no  buttle 
i mean buttle 
it s been confusion
from the word go 
he s been overcharged for
information retrieval procedures   
and someone somewhere
is trying to make us carry the can 
can i have a look 
i  ve never seen a refund check before 
i  ll bet it s jeffries 
yes 
he always believes that people should
pay more for their interrogation 
and   b   he loathes me 
we ve gotta get rid of it 
well  send it to somebody else 
better still  send it to buttle 
after all  it s his check 
i ve tried that 
but look  look at this 
you see  the population census
has gotten him down as  dormanted  
uh  the central collective storehouse computer
has got him down as  deleted  
hang on 
information retrieval
has got him down as  inoperative  
security has got him down as  excised  
  administration has him down as  completed   
  he s dead 
le  
dead 
well  that s awful 
we ll never get rid
of the damn thing now 
what we gonna do  sam 
could try next of kin 
next of kin 
  yes

central banking 
veronica buttle 
mrs 
deposit 
thank god for that 
uh  would you like some tea 
there s a problem 
she doesn t have a bank account 
well  that s it  then 
i might just as well
go and hang myself now 
this sort of thing could never have happened
before this stupid seventh tier reorganization 
that s simmons s doing  and he and jeffries
always sit together at lunch 
bastards 
sh   shh  shh 
perhaps we could lose the thing behind
a filing cabinet or something   burn it  eat it 
look  there is one solution 
what 
drive out to mrs  buttle 
let her sign the back of the check 
she can cash it
at the corner sweet shop

i ll even do it for you 
here  authorize the check 
sign there  there and there 
  and sign the check there 
  yes

sam 
  mm hmm 
you are good to me  you know

stop calling me that 
mother  mother  please 
  is this guy bothering you 
  oh  tsk  tsk  tsk  tsk 
mother 
go away 
this is a very sacred moment 
he s got away from us  jack 
afraid you re right  mr  helpmann 
he s gone 
mmm 
well  
  then  
  tomorrow was another day  
  the morning found me miles away  
  with still a million things to say  
  now  
  as twilight gleams the sky above  
  recalling thrills of our love
