centre existence powerful dynamo
sun
gives us heat light drives great engine life
food chain part
matter even youre hardcore meateater
dinner started plants somewhere turning sunlight food
us
solar powered
maybe ancient egyptians right worship sun
four billion years sun given life everything
land sea
rover one rover two
edge wall beginning descent
names dijanna figueroa im phd student uc santa barbara
cool copy starting descent
think one coolest jobs world
check corkscrew coral
im marine biologist get go bottom ocean
study amazing organisms live
theres nothing id rather
rover one rover one copy
walls pretty amazing
barely edge photosynthesis right
ambient lights really going
youre totally reliant technology thats little bubble
dive depth mystery
never know youre gon na see
look krill oh gosh
looks like krill heaven rover one
yeah roger pretty incredible
seeing much anything alive dijanna
much life think pretty much photic zone
like moon huh
copy
hey look got crinoid right
hey dijanna got crinoid finally found citizen
copy
yeah looks like getting deeper animals
look like theyre suspension feeders particle feeders
light surface much survive
places ocean sunlight never reached
since world began yet amazing life forms thrive
invited join new expedition explore places
say yes
keldysh keldysh ares bridge
yeah dave begin dive reef right
got mir one going water
like weve got central area work rover one gon na stay
im jim cameron heres deal
love stuff
exploration real honesttogod deep ocean exploration
way exciting madeup hollywood special effects
deep ocean expeditions always seem like space missions
combine outer space inner space
sure well take marine biologists
take astrobiologists space researchers
thats bunch space scientists wound
thousand miles nearest land
right feet darkness
insane alien life forms ever discovered
two ships
four manned submersibles
forty dives ten sites atlantic pacific
like big operations one hook
well come together like well try stay couple meters apart
dont want drift
communications compromised multiple subs water
working frequency russian english
want make sure stay visual
plan coordinate foursub dive
using ships two mirs two rovers could rendezvous bottom
would world first
hi dr sagalevitch
anatoly sagalevitch heads manned submersibles laboratory
russian academy sciences
weve working together almost decade

adventurers
fault titanic twice
bismarck
sometime around middle bismarck anatoly says
know wrecks good theyre interesting
something real
science something real
genya chernaiev one russian mir pilots
hes flying submersibles years
important thing boat course view
degrees unobstructed
view makes rovers unique
acrylic sphere cant go deep mirs
theyd joining us atlantic leg journey
also jake little remotely operated bot
wed used explore titanic bismarck wrecks
jake modified test variety sampling tools
brother mike jakes inventor pilot expedition
challenge steer jake safely around volcanically active vent sites
fry little bot
would hopefully allow us get close personal
creatures wed come see
weve checked decks twice rigging looks squared away
brother us
jd safety communications officer board ares
called crap job number
launch procedure per book everythings straightforward
shes first shes second recovery determined jim bottom
recovery go either way
chose ares giant aframe stern
massive hydraulic cylinders lift sub deck
water ease
one safest ways launch large payload ship
constantly tested procedures everything dialed
upcoming foursub dive
right lets stations lets
im gon na need everybody keep ears open observant
keep eyes open lights submersibles
know gon na challenging think pull
right go jacks
finally everything motion
middle north atlantic
thousand miles nearest land
little expedition make history
motion motion
nice slow blue winch nice slow
gunnin runnin huh yeah
least plan
stop stop stop
copy lima charlie problem right
aframe
ill let know soon crew gets sorted
hour minutes ago safety stop
uh know aframe went south
complete breakdown cylinder ultimately amounts cold stop
bolts shot
paint thats forever busts loose situation
happened one well
yeah right mean middle ocean broken aframe
thats sounds like
gon na get fixed
call aframesrus know little service ship come
thousand miles shore
dont move immediately
least something need start processing
well mean cant fix
dont alternate way launching sub
expeditions
going explore accept fact
one hand theres risk stay night long
thinking every single factor thats involved youre
making sure youve thought everything
cause eliminate things think
youve eliminated ninetenths go wrong
way last onetenth pops youre middle
dont worry stuff cause youve dealt
look completely serious idea cutting bulwark away side
best idea ive heard alternate plan yet
cut side right ship
say go clear captain right
ok well plan b
right talk tonight
dont think try allup drill tonight
mean people since morning
became apparent way get subs ares
use main crane sliding submersibles side vessel
crane feet actual pick point submersible
object starts swing cant stop
called wreckingball effect
gets away cant get back
im guessing weve got six eight feet travel im thinking use
ultimately resulted jim writing page manual
thought best way launch vessel
eye feeds
spent long time devising four separate pick points
well eight different points connection submersible
stop swaying
would practice night long
dawn following day ready attempt first time
spent past hours rebuilding entire launch recovery system
required us cut wall rerig every capstan rerig every block tackle
weve got different points rigging
every single point checked hand
single point fails anything
blue winch cable snaps breaks
lose sub risk chance losing somebody deck
im looking every pulley tension looking
keldysh advised go launch ops
deck crew advised minutes start launch operation
paul yeah roger dp control
mir ones going water right
lets see crane guys
oh yes stow get line
byebye
tim straps
keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going
dp control keldysh mirs beginning descent
say goodbye surface world
love part
everything go ready vent
rover one
go ahead rover one
start tandem descent
ok go three two one
venting go go go ok venting
venting
right rock roll go
descent lost city takes minutes
plenty time think youre
name loretta hidalgo im explorer
copy rover one rover two hearing loud clear
goal one day explore reaches space
bomb yeah meters
surface rover two meters bottom
god structures gorgeous
ok theres rendezvous point right
mir two mir two rover two copy
mir two mir two rover two copy
thats affirmative rover two good visual
something humans ever done
first time four deep submersibles ever dived together
water pressure get feet mindboggling
youve ever carried bucket water know thats foot water
imagine feet water
weight buckets lined head
pressing submarine
definitely something humans evolved
ok loretta relay mike position bot ops
copy
mir two mir two go bot deploy
uh roger well get set bot ops
ok yeah
theres jake
see tether spinning
like spider spinning web
im gon na pull little tether left current
ill yaw back right
really pushing boundary
extreme environment
incredible experience feeling like id transported future
hi bot
space mission watching another spacecraft
coming work us
hi mike get
affirmative affirmative
push tiny bit get right close go
oh wow seeing structure
yeah beautiful
ok mike come right degrees come forward
youll come big fan right corner rock
copy
oh gorgeous feel like im
liking im loving
ok im gon na come little bit well pretty good
ive encountered little current expected right
oh gosh
hello mr big
hes like dont even mess
oh oh god
wow
wow
kevin hand one astrobiologists
hes brilliant guy
really
thats one interesting things think europan ocean
ask two questions life europa
could life originated europa
astrobiology study life worlds
since kevin doesnt real extraterrestrial specimens analyze yet
hes next best thing
looking life extreme conditions deep ocean
hes theory guy hes never sea
let alone inside submersible headed bottom ocean
go unknown
rover two mir two copies loud clear loud clear
yeah looks like goes long ways
mir two right us
people get see mir two angle
fantastic
scale things much larger imagined
amazing
weve got huge huge carbonate structure
unbelievable
copy right rotator going rotator going
hot water flowing slowly forming stalactites
upsidedown stalactites slowly deposited millennium millennium
whats interesting
dont necessarily need plate tectonics
need means water react deep mantle rock
get serpentinization reaction
produces heat drives formation systems
absolutely phenomenal
want go ahead proceed summit
roger
theres warm water yeah
vent fluid coming right
wow amazing
technology level
safely explore depths ocean
kinda friable yeah
ok
yeah look
got rock hey got sample
rover one rover one rover two
oh goodness look oh christ
holy cow
ok stop stop stop kevin seeing
look thing absolutely unreal
see get lights right
roger
oh goodness look amazing
oh man look thing
look thing incredible
something like alive
creature like work absolutely phenomenal
beautiful
absolutely beautiful
see reticulation inside thing look
amazing
idea
thats love stuff
every single dive youre gon na see something youve never seen
might even see something nobodys ever seen
seeing thing look
like ugliest fish world
oh hes got feet look hes got feet hes got like little toesocks
thing deep diving always need expect unexpected
oh god look squid
oh massive
look look look quick look
see
absolutely fantastic
look fish see guy
right got us dumbo hoping
beautiful animal beautiful animal look
like dancer
amazing creature
god could watch guy day
almost looks like hes glowing within
mir one mir one rover two copy
mir one mir one copy rover two
mir one mir one rover two copy
intermittent jim sometimes yes sometimes
uh roger mike
seriously low power leave bottom
get ahold vince
must go
genya must go
oh hes trying say something
hes trying say look porthole
cant see
call surface
hes saying might
need contact surface ascending
cant read zoom lets see read sign
contact surface must surface understood well contact right
ares surface comm rover two leaving bottom
x minus minus
depth meters
jim got goods definitely got
ah thing phenomenal
see oh incredible incredible
huge um jellyfish
type gelatinous
massive like meter
think feeding uh
amphipods plankton copepods next
hanging lights hanging light yeah
hows work man dont know
working somehow exactly
lifes pretty cool yeah absolutely fantastic
welcome back kevin thanks
team rover go team rover
name maya tolstoy im marine seismologist
lamontdoherty earth observatory
study underwater volcanoes
particularly study earthquakes volcanoes make
im trying understand earth made
surface planet formed
im going deploying oceanbottom seismometers
instruments listen earthquakes
noises ocean floor
ocean light goes far
sound allows basically see bottom ocean
see ocean crust way light lets see surface
put instruments side ship drop gather data
normally dont dive order job
exciting finally see environment
ive working decade
mir two copy
visual inbound
roger
see yeah window
looks like spaceship
wow
thats incredible thats like another planet
incredible world
important formation planet
two thirds surface world created
still know little
see theyre shiny glassy
oh yeah look shows cooled superquickly
thats like really turns glass basically obsidian called
look
see theres hardly sediment
thats really fresh brandnew crust looking
wow
imagine stuff erupts
molten rock oozing hitting freezing cold water
cant imagine must insane
must look pretty cool
seconds die
miss son
hes five months old
hard decision make come
think important study one remarkable phenomenon
weve ever discovered oceans
mir two keep going upslope heading
chimneys top sulfide mound
roger
wow

around world
running middle oceans like seams baseball
cracks spreading centers
crust planet literally ripping apart
sea looks normal
two miles violent landscape
fresh lava flows crack freezes rock
sea water seeps molten rock beneath new crust
gets superheated far hotter boiling
cant boil intense pressure bottom ocean
comes roaring sea floor
superheated water hits freezing ocean minerals condense
forming chimneys creating black smoke
see black smoke youre really seeing
blowtorch superheated water
uh getting position get water sample
top one structures
yeah roger thats good
ok lets get close chimney genya
chimneys reach degrees fahrenheit
thats hot enough melt windows submersible
thats bad thing
mental note dont melt windows submersible
guys getting really close black smoker
close enough think maybe little close
uh well starting get plume
right underneath sub
genya move back better move back
ok start move back
thats normal usually drive right em like
right top little freaky
thats pretty cool kevin
geologys fascinating came
keldysh keldysh mir two bottom
depth meters
top moose structure
sites first visited years ago geologists
werent looking life
wasnt got submersible
went bottom see eyes
like oh god theres life beautiful
entire ecosystem
wow thats awesome
copy thats imaging right
look hot water theyre right flow
oh man check
like liquid fire guys dancing right next
really tickling dragons tail
science community stunned
could animals living toxic chemicals
pressures around extremes temperature
freezing beyond boiling inches
could whole ecosystem living without sunlight
living thriving
unbelievable
insane amount biomass ever saw life
wow
holy pancakes batman
theyre right flow enjoying hydrothermal fluid
oh look em swarming love smoke
oh yeah
vents providing energy life
coming chemicals dissolved water
coming inside earth
photosynthesis chemosynthesis
whole new basis life one didnt need sun
water heat
partys going dark last billion years
gon na going next billion years
theyre thing got nothing us
sun could go tomorrow wouldnt know wouldnt care
exploring discovering ecosystems like
may depend energy sun
opens sorts interesting possibilities
think search life elsewhere
wherever weve found liquid water planet earth weve found life
thats pretty profound
find liquid water elsewhere solar system gon na find life
wont know unless start searching
fact nasa planning mission called jupiter icy moons orbiter
aka jimo
feet long gon na several times longer
planetary probe ever launched
nuclear reactor power ion engines big science radar
main goal jimo use radar
look ice jupiters three largest moons
first study callisto itll move ganymede
bizarre moons largest jupiters known moons
callisto ganymede crusts ancient ice rock
may hide oceans miles surface
io moon fire ice
ios eccentric orbit causes deform circles jupiter
intense tidal pumping pulls moon like taffy
generating friction core becomes heat
heat drives solar systems largest active volcanoes
constant eruptions rivers lava
volcanic plumes shooting hundreds miles space
gem jovian system least far search life concerned
europa
fire ice come together perfect harmony
scientific community relatively certain
beneath icy chaotic shell europa exists liquid water ocean
twice volume earths oceans combined
tidal heating working keeping water freezing
possibly providing energy life
kind life finding deep vents earth
see yellow white orange
thats huge colony microbes
acres acres bacterial mass
look could like little glimpse back time
yeah couple billion years ago
hydrothermal vents planet earth
since oceans formed
may sites like around life began
sort scoop top area
maybe little bit sediment
excellent
nice sample
see stringy little filaments make mat
extremophiles simply life forms thrive extremes
temperature pressure radiation
environments us deadly
microbes go far beyond anything imagination could conceive
back first started studying might find life
find anything europa probably gon na look like
absolutely
think gon na try get evidence life another planet
weve certainly got ta look evidence life first
sample weve got right
pan conrad one senior astrobiologists
comes jet propulsion laboratory
shes one valuable people knows make science fun
know little used play like submarine

cool way better cardboard box
tolya see ease structure
absolutely
like mushroom planet looks exactly like mushroom
ah thats gorgeous like mirror
thats hot water forming surface
cool
see bacteria growing right along edge right hot flow
see
bacterial mats top
certain molecules found living organisms
glow theyre hit ultraviolet laser
good place fluorometer reading
think great place fluorometer reading
designed life detection tool way
could point rock say
aha theres evidence life
lights
ok im going start measurement ready
go
ok lasers firing
got lot signal
whoo good weve got like counts ultraviolet
interesting doctor life
theres definitely organic stuff
important study
extreme environments earth
go solar system look life
mir two copy
go ares
name kelly snook work nasa im planetary scientist
copy
study process exploration
rover two mir two
daytoday work
learn use earth training ground going another planet
looking analogs
baboom
basket slam dunk
slam dunk center line
thought bacterial told anatoly pick
people ship middle ocean
studying hydrothermal vents making film
mars
people bottom ocean
surface mars
everything ocean ten times harder think going
go thinking gon na really hard know
dont see mars surface ops space
different
yeah hopefully well time day sort debug comm protocols
way interacting
team included astronaut megan mcarthur
nasa johnson space center
astrobiologist tori hoehler nasa ames research center
worked together explore ways humans technologies
improve science discoveries well make moon mars
combination science technology
especially environment like ocean
similar space exploration
submersible like pressurized rover mars
using opportunity learn lessons space
go ahead roberto
find microbial mats right near chimney
uh guess depends able configure mirs
would talk remote scientists nasa
would get requests particular rocks
would process rocks prepare take back earth
think probably loaded bacteria
think white stuff likely like say sulfur oxidizers
analogs like key understanding
well scientific exploration moon mars
need manipulators like mir probably
handle problems technical glitches
doubt extended planetary mission
whatever switched better switch back
right
rover one mir one
advised lost starboard horizontal thruster
uh weve lost ac lost pan tilt
probably gon na abort
every event planned unplanned
generates data apply future
much study humans interact technology
allows accomplish tasks
technology simple
space bottom ocean nothing simple
yes
oh
gon na go
ay
cant rotate scoop edge carousel
put
rotate scoop
one piece gone inside
yeah ok good right got got one one
better integrate technology like robotics
human exploration systems
effectively well able explore solar system
feel like im spacecraft im sorry
said feel like im spacecraft
thats right
inner space worlds best spacecraft
explore planet youre
experience human beings inside submersible
interested
marge marge simpsons hairdo
hardware process
communications people robots
scientist interface technology
trying study
ok guys id like come right
youve look cause getting much image
current course favorable
thats ok wouldnt fun easy right
whats fish big fish dont scared
want take sample small sulfide rocks
bottom would fine
technologically difficult thing
pick rock bottom ocean
put sample collection device
thats really core interested
humans going small easy tasks difficult environment
whoa got currents come gripper grip
got
oh hang onto baby
right got barely got got
ok try get carousel
well task would take person field
couple minutes earth take hours mars
every step new challenge
translate right little bit another two inches
cant send people mars right away would send probably six
people responsible
science exploration surface
kind like proxies thousands people back earth
interested mission
mars obvious first place look life solar system
theres evidence earth mars
share similar history abundant water
one important key elements life know water
mars see today dry dusty cold apparently dead
set wayback machine didnt look like
could imagine life evolving mars
impact great enough
based know extremophiles
think life could survive trip mars earth rock
possible life could viable long trip
might martians might another solar system entirely
right put hand would sacrifice ten years life go mars
im going sure
would talk husband letting go mars
say right honey gon na five years ok
im gon na write every day well email
whoa thats loaded question
funny cause asked question would go mars
raised hand without even thinking consequences life home
husband cat mom dad
cat
thatd hard think hed say go really
cause think us human exploration bug
somebody love opportunity go
represent humanity explore think hed push go
youve keldysh almost month
easy pretend youre way mars
youre far away everything know
small environment crew
professional interests
theyre explore theyre science
russians resourceful
showing us sampling tools
tool sample anything youd want sample
things really clever
simple nikolai pot
basically pot stole cook nikolai
something love getting part
know get culture look engineering
operations
incredible environment working
love way brings people together
victor
obed
lunch
yeah yes thats right
yeah yay
expedition captured lot spirit
ok right
idea something really difficult
people come together make something like happen
poyehaly
way communicate
forward
victors practicing
vitka khorosho khorosho
one things enjoy russian culture
way integrate play work
vosempyaty
mean ive studied russian college
always wanted work russian space program
keldysh great analog know space launch complex
understood astronauts always saying
say technicians engineers pad
real heroes making sure youre gon na safe
expedition captured lot spirit
engines start
sea two incredible explorers
already way mars
spirit got first blazing thin martian atmosphere mph
opportunity arrived weeks later
landing nerveracking affair
current altitude approximately feet
awaiting confirmation
moving speed miles per hour near terminal velocity
cleaner separation end detected
signal moment
deepspace network tracking stations canberra searching primary signal
mars everybody
equipped highresolution stereoscopic cameras
swiss army knifes worth geological
chemical science instruments
mission mars exploration rovers clear
find evidence water mars past
conditions may favorable life
learn lot rock know ask
know look
two rovers opportunity really hit jackpot
ancient bedrock absolutely loaded hematite
ironbearing mineral usually forms interaction liquid water
scientists detected jarosite
mineral suggests rocks may soaked acid ground water
hot springs environment like yellowstone national park
clues included empty cavities inside rocks
salt crystals may dissolved away
rippled sediment patterns
hinting presence freeflowing water thousands years
blueberries tiny spheres hematite
eroded rocks spilled surface
earth spheres like form presence water time
spirit opportunity helped confirm water mars
equipped tell us water
job fell mars odyssey orbiter
detected believed massive quantities water ice
feet surface highest concentrations poles
phoenix rise ashes mars polar lander
using many failed missions spare parts
land near martian north pole
first time ever
martian probe scratch surface
phoenix dig deep permafrost
sample martian water first time
everything learn mars makes story exciting
theres evidence past water theres evidence past volcanism
chemistry checks
ingredients life thats keep searching
course thats way searching life universe
look hes computer coordinated know
says seti institute shirt laptop
little top thats impressive
youre putting message well know gave
one groups im affiliated
search extraterrestrial intelligence institute
seti institute try detect intelligent signals
distant civilizations around another star
frank drake one founders seti institute
wrote set factors known drake equation
includes factors fraction stars around planets form
fraction habitable planets life emerges
fraction life evolves intelligence
eventually becoming toolusing civilizations
communicate civilizations galaxy
last factor lifetime intelligent communicating civilization
time develop technology
communicate beings distant planet
also develop technology annihilate
thats standard intelligent civilizations galaxy
going much luck searching life elsewhere
lets say kind modified drakes equation
says life possible planet distance sun
even anywhere near sun planetarylike body
like moon jupiter whatever ice around ok
kind tidal pumping gravity source near
liquid core generating heat
making heat like hydrothermal vents seeing
said maybe ten twenty fifty times many worlds like
isnt logical assume get call one buddies
seti institute finally picks signal
gon na coming somebody bore ice
set transmitter ice
statistically isnt indicated talking
theres flaw statement ice worlds common
idea right
got one liquid water planet solar system
weve already identified three potential hydrospheres
icecovered far sun right
based immediate experience threetoone ratio
sure sure know habitable
dont got ta go look right
may find icy little worlds like europa
bulk liquid water exists galaxy
fact thats bulk life may exist
knows
really interesting think evolution intelligence
icy world system
would evolve intelligence
would wonder bottom ice shell
primary focus site mussels crabs
ok need mussels crabs gon na crabs crab trap
gon na crab traps
hoping whatever fix crab trap trap guys
care put crab trap
preferably theres crabs
yes currently x coordinates minus
coordinates minus
story vents really story microbes
right
bottom food chain waving fields bacteria
vent fluid kind liquid sunshine
powering whole food chain
animals eating bacteria
preying ones eat bacteria
kind ethereal huh
would thought bacteria could beautiful
animals eating bacteria
theres something else going
symbiosis dance life partners different species
vent animals like shrimp mussels
formed symbiotic relationships microbes
live chemicals vent fluid
oh near something big guys
large mussel beds jackpot
study metabolic molecular physiology
mussels crabs live deep sea vents
im focusing ability withstand variations
large variations temperature
genus bathymodiolus
scientific name mussels study
weve got mussel mound right genya
think perfect spot mussel collections
yes see im talking
think mixed sizes get small ones
take small big also need small
small small
ok malinky yeah small
yes ok
right
keldysh keldysh mir one
collected full batch mussels clam bucket
x minus minus
oh yeah bingo baby
looks like got crabs
yes got crabs big time like full

bio box closed crabbage
crabbage
wan na open yeah
phd advisor jim childress
hes studying hydrothermal vent communities
since discovery late
years experience going sea science
extreme environments
childress lab one labs world
thats able keep animals maintain
environment similar come
fast take animals collected
bring lab
place maintenance respirometry system
call thing condo
put animals little condos
repressurize pressure collected
make sure back temperature
optimal survival
pick animals use experiments
transfer another system
thats called highpressure respirometry system
system extremely unique special
manipulate environmental conditions
look metabolic rates animals
vary environmental condition thats love study
looking mussels gain better understanding
temperature adaptation might help us future
comes warming planet
global warming real
putting planet risk life know species
mean whole food chain whole ecosystem
point gon na deal
think got ocean mysterious
unknown
explored hasnt conquered
appreciate respect
ever think youd end
oh god
guess path questions tried answer
led path ended
question im trying answer
taking submarines bottom ocean
ok lets uh let meeting come order
dive snake pit
pilots dr anatoly sagalevitch mir one genya chernaiev mir two
find structure work bot
well land base well try work structure
ideally way chimney
supposed much hot venting wall
shimmering water
dont think hot vents happen way top correct
best way visualize stuff wherever see something black
thats like blowtorch
thats know blowtorch made water
ok theres mir one
theyre coming us arent
youre halfway structure right
work way forward along wall
copy
theres antlershaped stone bowl thats filled juvenile rimicaris
roger
right think structure describing
think get little closer
thats see em
got oh wow
copy see
little shrimp different related
yes juvenile adults
vent shrimp rimicaris exoculata
grazing bacteria growing around
seeing crab sure
look em theyre eating bacteria thats growing crab
oh almost got guy look
hes covered bacteria
doesnt know thinks shrimp picking
like crabfu bottom ocean
shrimp colony go
lets check guy ok
black smoke look guys
cant believe theyre swimming
oops aah hot
ok cooking gon na cook
im gon na move little closer
bold
lets get back ive got full back command
heck right
theyre attached us lets stay away
theyre us theyre attacking us
lookit shrimp love theyre
shrimp loving jake check
look
oh wow oh goodness cant even see fly
see shrimp
yeah looks like weve got piggybackers
shrimp along ride
wow thats amazing
get shrimp sizzler
cant get shrimp sizzler
riftia giant tubeworms
hands stars deep vent community
also best example symbiosis action
ive got little bit shimmering water
ok wow oh gorgeous
animals dont even stomach
literally cant eat
depend completely large sac microbes inside body
produces food
get really close see pretty neat stuff
oh wow
see guy grab
want get ready think set
mark
oh might come us go
oh
crab got away tell em nice try
nice try nice try
theyre gorgeous underwater
long red plume like gill
takes oxygen also nutrients vent fluid
worms job keep plume flow
sucking nutrients feed bacteria inside
bacterias job convert sulfide chemicals food worm
question bacteria work worm
worm work bacteria
animals didnt exist could imagined
makes wonder else waiting discovered
youve got cool job genya
thank
real question could imagine colony europa
would oxygen coming know
whole idea dont need sunlight drive ecosystem
chemosynthesis need ambient oxygen
oxygen water came photosynthesis
photosynthesis million years ago maybe
doesnt matter however long takes water turn
question becomes oxygen necessary life
ah yeah yeah ok
may large animals ok get microbial level
want see large animals want see large animals
want see large animals dont want spend money
go space find microbe
oh come microbes great know theyre highly underrated
theyre good conversationalists mean look would want give
look let go forward one cool riftia patches
think makes life possible
guys incredible symbiosis microbes
yeah theyre living bacteria
im gon na give bouquet bacteria mom
would give bouquet riftia
look things theyre beautiful
jim says right
xygen afterburner fuelled explosion multicellular life world
even though chemosynthesis happens beyond light sun
many biological processes still require free oxygen
oxygen typically supplied photosynthesis surface earth
might oxygen come europa
europas orbit sits within jupiters enormous magnetic field
intense radiation continually slams energetic particles
europan surface
potential transform vast amounts water ice
things like hydrogen peroxide molecular oxygen
assuming oxidants make way ocean regular basis
cracks upwellings comet impacts
would represent energy jackpot life forms trying survive
hydrothermal samples
come play
trying replicate europan surface environment lab
rocks deep ocean
lets prep chamber
maybe take little piece ok sure
europa
part vacuum chamber
weve got liquid nitrogen coming grow ices
basically replicate surface environment europa
weve got highenergy electron gun
replicate radiation environment jovian magnetic field
tremendously large powerful magnetic field jupiter
would happen life exposed environment
taking microbes found hydrothermal vents
putting environment
bombarding blasting highenergy radiation
making sort chemical junkyard biological chemical compound junkyard
sort comparable say going junkyard earth
wander around junkyard see steering wheel tire
know one point complete car
send spacecraft europa going understand
chemical molecular biosignatures left behind
seeing kind signature surface europa
imply habitability ocean
menez gwens underwater volcano
really unique place hydrothermal vents
shimmering water everywhere
digging place digging place big time
big time
really see clear fluids
little bit cooler cause youre getting black smoke
site amazing dreamlike quality
cooler clear vent fluid isnt toxic black smokers
wind getting lot visitors
including opportunistic predators
oh look shimmering water coming structure
collect sample would fantastic
mir one mir one mir two
mir one go ahead
ok jim ready launch jake ready go
go coming
everything working ok yeah seems ok
getting work mike jake absolutely fantastic
think thing distant ancestor vehicle
may someday explore oceans worlds
ok mike looking good able take core sample
right base chimney
looks pretty hot though kevin like burning tree stump
incredible
ok looks like fluid coming
go right
best im working really hard
kind convective flow
wanted close close
careful
looks like hes hit blowtorch doesnt
think hes getting hit
mike back back got top bot right vent fluid
see im hot water
really want know
nice mike bot mike bot
stay calm got
yeah im gon na quick
oh yes think got think got
hey got ta go cap sample poked right chimney
yeah copy congratulations go back cap
roger
coming home
yeah look
jake took hits
damage looks pretty good shape
yeah pretty fun pretty intense
diving mike great fun mastermind robot
didnt realize much went making bot work right
right needs come little pete
bot small could fit mir
onboard power supply
back neutral ready go
inside sub laptop joystick
thats inside sub
fiber unique
allows us send light pulse back forth vehicle
thats talk vehicle
control little camera well
bot creates telepresence us
actually allows us feel like outside submarine
right im gon na get little bit closer oh hes beautiful
never saw anything like look
uhoh sees us hey hey hey
hes going
look look look hes grabbed gripper
hes putting tentacles gripper cool
whos grabbing incredible
deliberately reached straight probed gripper
ive never encounter like rov
animal came right us touched rov like
extraordinary encounter
though got shake hands alien
underwater explorer
probably one highlights whole experience underwater
hard imagine someday would possible
explore oceans another world
getting idea like explore
extreme environments planet
could well pave way exploring europa
mission explore ice europa
would ultimate robotic challenge
landing team mission control
would pretty much along ride
europa far away even speed light
would take hour command reach vehicle
really
smart enough avoid terrain hazards
find good landing site ice
get ice
need melt probe basically nuclearheated torpedo
ice could anywhere three sixteen miles deep
week week melt probe sink weight ancient ice
finally
gon na reach surface ocean
need auv autonomous underwater vehicle
needs one smart puppy
able navigate make decisions alien ocean
europa internal heat may well hydrothermal venting
