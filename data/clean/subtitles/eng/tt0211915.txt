14 670 times per minute
a blue fly
of the calliphorides species
landed in saintvincent street
montmartre
at the exact same second
outside a restaurant
the wind was sweeping in
under a tablecloth
causing the glasses to dance
without anybody noticing it
at the same time on the fifth floor
of 28 avenue trudaine
eugène koler erased the name
of his best friend émile maginot
in his adressbook
after coming home from his funeral
still at the same second
a spermatozoon
containing an xchromosome
and belonging to m raphaël poulain
was reaching the ovum
of mrs poulain
born amandine fouet
9 months later a girl was born
amélie poulain
amélies father was a former
army doctor
and was working at the hydropathic
establishment of enghienlesbains
raphaël poulain doesnt like
peeing next to somebody else
he doesnt like
noticing people laughing
at his sandals
coming out of the water with
his swimming suit sticking to his body
raphaël poulain likes
to tear big pieces of wallpaper
off the walls
to line up his shoes
and polish them with great care
to empty his toolbox
clean it thoroughly
and finally put everything away carefully
amélies mother amandine fouet
was a primary school teacher
from gueugnon
she had always been
unstable and nervy
she doesnt like to have her fingers
all wrinkled by hot water
she doesnt like it when
somebody she doesnt like
touches her
to have the marks of the sheets
on her cheek in the morning
she likes the outfits of
the iceskaters on tv
to shine the flooring
to empty her handbag
clean it thoroughly
and finally putting everything away carefully
amélie is 6 years old
she would like her father to hold her
in his arms from time to time
but the only contact they have
is during the monthly medical checkup
moved by this intimacy
the little girl
cant stop her heart
from beating wildly
as a result
her father believes she suffers
from a heart disease
because of this fictitious illness
she doesnt go to school
her mother acts
as her private tutor
the chicken often
hatch in the convent
the chicken
very good
hatch often
no
with no contact with
other children
and mollycoddled by her parents
amélies only refuge
is the world she makes up
in that world vinyls are made
the same way as pancakes
and the neighbours wife who has been
in a coma for months
just decided to do all
her sleeping at once
this way ill stay awake
night and day for the rest of my life
amélies only friend
is called the cachalot
but the atmosphere at home turned it
into a neurasthenic and suicidal fish
since these suicideattempts
only increased her mothers stress
a decision is taken
enough
in order to comfort amélie
her mother gives her
a secondhand kodak
what have you done
a neighbour makes her believe that
her camera causes accidents to happen
since shes been taking pictures
all afternoon
amélie finds herself in deep worry
in the evening
she collapses in front of the televison
feeling guilty
for a fire
2 derailments
and the crash of a boeing 747
later on amélie realizes
that the neighbour had made fun of her
and decides to take her revenge
but what the
you be careful
and then one day
tragedy struck her
like every year her mother
had taken her to church to lit a candle
so that heaven would
send her a little brother
the divine answer
came 3 minutes later
alas it wasnt a newborn
that fell out of the sky
but a tourist from quebec
determined to end her life
amandine poulain born fouet
is killed outright
after her mothers death
amélie finds herself alone
with her father
the latter withdraws into himself
even more
he starts to build
a miniature mausoleum
for the ashes of his beloved wife
days months
then years go by
the outside world seems so dull
that amélie prefers to dream her life
until shes old enough to leave
5 years later amélie is a waitress
in a bar in montmartre
les deux moulins
todays 29 august
in 48 hours the destiny of
amélie poulain will take a different turn
but right now she has no idea
of whats going to happen
for her life goes on
with her collegues and the regulars
this is suzanne the landlady
she limps a little but has
never spilled the slightest drop
when she was young she used to be
a horsedancer she likes
sportsmen who cry
from disappointment
she doesnt like it when a man
is humiliated in front of his kid
the tobacconist is georgette
the hypochondriac
when its not a migraine
its the sciatic nerve thats trapped
she doesnt like to hear
le fruit de vos entrailles
est béni
this is gina amélies colleague
granddaughter of a healer
she likes to crack her fingers
here you can see her bringing a kir
to hipolito the notsuccessful writer
what he likes
is to see a bullfighter getting gored
this is joseph
ginas jealous exlover
he spies on her
to see if shes replaced him
the only thing he likes
is to pop the bubbles
of plastic wrappings
and finally theres philomène
the air hostess
amélie looks after her cat
when shes away she likes
the sound of the bowl with water on the floor
as for the cat
he likes to listen to
childrens stories
no thanks maam
i never work on sundays
amélie often goes to see her father
during the we by train
why dont you enjoy your retirement and
do what
travel
you never left enghien
when we were young
your mother and me
wed have liked to travel
but we never could
because of your heart
yes i know
and now
now
sometimes amélie goes to the movies
i like to turn around in the dark
to see the faces of the people around
and i also like to spot the little
detail nobody will ever see
but i dont like it
when the driver doesnt watch the road
amélie doesnt have a boyfriend
she tried but it didnt
live up to her expectations
on the other hand she enjoys
all sorts of little pleasures
putting her hand
in a bag of seeds
piercing the crust
of crème brûlée
with the tip of a spoon
and play at ducks and drakes
on the saintmartincanal
this is the cristalman
because of an illness his bones
break like cristal
all his furniture is fleecelined
a hand shake is enough
to break his fingerbones
so he never goes out
time hasnt changed anything amélie still
shelters in solitude
and asks herself silly questions
about the world or about this town
for example how many couples are
having an orgasm right now
fifteen
and finally the night of
30 august 1997
this is what will change
the life of amélie poulain totally
good evening
the princess of wales lady di
died this afternoon in a car crash
she was with her friend
only the first man to enter
the grave of toutankhamon
may understand how
amélie felt
when she discovered the treasure
that had been hid by a little boy
on the 31st of august
at 4 in the morning
amélie suddenly has
a luminous idea
she is going to find the owner
of this box
and return his treasure to him
if hes moved thats it shell
start to mingle with other peoples lives
if not well too bad
oh the young missie of the 5th floor
we dont often see you
excuse me did a little boy use to live
in my flat in the 50ies
come in
and have a drink
no thanks
yes come in close the door
oh kids

they start throwing snowballs
i know
how long have you been here
since 64
people must have told you
no
sit down
my husband used to work
at coccinelle insurance
people liked to say
he slept with his secretary
they certainly did stop at
all the hotels in batignolles
and not the little ones
cause the bitch
would certainly spread her legs
but only in satin cheets
my husband started to steal
from his firm
first only a little
then 50 million at once
and there they went flew away both of em
drink
so on january 20 1970
the doorbell rings well
maam your husband died
in a car crash in south america
my life just stopped
black lion died of sorrow

with love in his eyes

but amélie likes him
he holds the endives

a bird thats fallen from the nest

at night he gets up
and punches my oleanders

ducks and drakes

bredoteau
thats all i have to say
this young man who rummages
about under the photo machine
is called nino quincampoix
amélie was denied the company
of other children
but little nino
would rather have done without
often at the same moment
9 km away from each other
one was dreaming about a sister
and the other about a brother
with whom theyd play
all the time
hello dad
made yourself a new friend
no ive had it for ages
but since your mother
hated it
i had put it away in the shed
lets reconcile them with each other
there not bad eh
say dad
if you found something from
your childhood a treasure for you
would it make you happy sad
nostalgic how would you feel
i didnt have the dwarf
when i was a kid
it was a present
when i retired
no the things you keep a secret
as if it was of great value
i should varnish it
before the fall
im gonna make tea
do you want some
dont move
youre ok better
hey close the door
its not like siberia
youre not allergic
to carbon monoxyde
i coughed so much last night
that my pleural membrane almost broke
yes of course
whats the menu today
endive au gratin
theyll bring you to your knees
so theyre good
depends on where you fall
true if its in the toilet

1215am burst of laughter
reminiscent of an orgasm
to please the dominating male
i cant take it anymore
yes true
why does he insists
theres other bars
goodbye
mrs suzanne
yes
is there béchamel sauce
in your endives
of course why
béchamel sauce
doesnt agree with me

and youre coming back emptyhanded
from your hunt for bretodeau
because its not do
its to
like toto
thanks
i really like this painting
its the rowers lunch
by renoir
i paint one every year
for 20 years now
the hardest is the eyes
sometimes they change
their moods on purpose
when im not looking
they look happy here
they better be
this year they had
hare with morel
and waffles with jam
for the children
lets see where did i put
that little note
i see youre looking at
my camera at the window
its a gift from my sisterinlaw
oh i just put it there this way
no need to wind up
my clock anymore
after all these years
the only character i
cant quite figure out
is the girl with the glass of water
shes in the middle
and yet outside
maybe shes just
different from the others
how different
i dont know
as a kid maybe she didnt often
play with other children
maybe even never
here you are
dominique bretodeau
27 rue mouffetard
its for you
this morning
like every tuesday
dominique bretodeau goes out
to buy a chicken
usually he cooks it in the oven
with baked potatoes
after cutting off the legs
the breast and the wings
hell clean up the bones
with his fingers
starting with the oyster
no bretodeau wont buy
a chicken today
he wont go any further
than that telephone booth
there
in one second bretodeau
remembers everything
bahamontes victory
in the tour de france 1959
aunt josettes corselets
and especially
that tragic day
when he won all the marbles
of his classmates during playtime
bretodeau
bretodeau
the claw bretodeau
does he know it the claw
one cognac please
i cant believe
what just happened to me
it mustve been my guardian angel
cant be anything else
its as if
the telephone booth was calling me
it rang and rang
well my
theres the microwave calling
can i have another cognac
its weird life
when youre a kid
time creeps slowly and then one day
youre 50
and childhood
whatevers left of it
fits into
a little rusty box
you dont have children
yet do you
miss
i have a daughter
she must be about your age
we havent spoken to each
other for years now
i heard she has a child
a little boy
his name is lucas
its about time
i went to pay them a visit
before i end up in a box myself
dont you think
amélie suddenly feels
in perfect harmony with herself
everythings perfect
the softness of the light
that little scent in the air
the peaceful sounds of the city
life seems so simple
and cristalclear that shes swept
by this desire to help
the all mankind
ill help you
we go down and there we go
theres the widow
of the drummer of the brass band
hey the horses lost one ear
the husband of florist is laughing
theres lollipops
in the shop window
can you smell his scent
this man is offering melon
to his clients to taste
there they make
wonderful icecream
were passing
in front of the butchers
ham on the bone costs 79
here were at the cheese merchants
1290 for a picodon dardèche
at the butchers
a babys looking at a dog
thats looking at the chicken
here you are now
were at the metro station
ill leave you here goodbye
she was never able to enter
into relationships with others
as a kid she was
always on her own
on the evening of a bright
day in july
while holidaymakers
enjoy themselves on the beach
in the carefreeness of the
sunny days and while in paris
the strollers overcome by the heat
gaze at the trails of smoke
of the fireworks
amélie poulain also known
as the godmother of the rejected
or the madonna of the castoffs
succumbs to exhaustion
in the streets of paris
struck with grief
millions of mourning anonyms
gather for the funeral cortège
to show in silence
their great sorrow
of being forever orphans
what a strange fate
that of this young woman
deprived of herself
yet so sensitive to the charm
of the little things in life
like don quichotte
she was determined to grapple
the unforgiving grinder
of all the human sorrows
an impossible fight
that consumed
her life prematurely
at 23 amélie poulain
let her life deteriorate
in the swirls of universal pain
and there she was struck by the regret
of having let her father die
without ever being able to give
back to this suffocated man
the breath of air
shed been able to give
to so many others
hey mister
hey mister
sir
wait
wait
pages
full of failed identity photos
that their owners had
thrown away
and that had been reassembled
and classified by some eccentric
some familyalbum
one gauloises blondes
theres so much smoke
where are they
i cant see anything
more to the left
a bit further there you are
there thanks
where are my 1f coins

one moresque
on kir one moresque
and two and 2 peppermint cordials
that cooing is it prenuptial
or postcoital
and your bloody stupidity
is it congenital
prenuptial
dont worry
youll find the right one in the end
they all dream about sleeping
on a mans shoulder
i wouldnt mind
but men snore
i have a sensitive ear
i was operated i got rid of it
how romantic
its clear youve never known
true love
if i hadnt known it they wouldnt
have shortened my right leg
wasnt it a horse
yes precisely
i was in love
with a trapeze artist
i shouldve known they dump you
at the last moment
he dumped me
as i was going into the circus ring
i was so upset
and as a result so was the horse
unfortunately i was under it
right  the moresque
love at first sight it does exists
im not sayin it doesnt
but after 30 years behind the bar
i can even give you the recipe
take two regulars make them
believe they like each other
let it simmer
works every time
excuse me
excuse me
no
ill go
dont you think youve done
enough harm already
ginas old enough to
defend herself
im not thinking about gina
but about georgette
georgette
open your eyes
shes hoping for you
and youre only looking at gina
poor thing
look at all shes doing
to try and attract
your attention
youre blind
im off i have a date

goodbye
goodbye
i dont know
how the new one will be
butll never be worse than
that freak there with his tape recorder
josephs not really a freak
hes hurting thats all
its been two months
since they broke up
and he still shows up every day
he likes to suffer
dont tell me you
havent noticed anything
what do you mean
he always sits there
well yes

good night
good morning
a swiss octogenarian has received
a letter 30 years later
the mail was found by
mountaineers on the montblanc
in a bag
of the malabar princess
a plane that crashed
at the end of the 60ies
what a pity
such a young and pretty princess
you mean old and ugly
that wouldnt have been that bad
well yes look at mother theresa
and him
still after gina
no after somebody else
tell me
is it someone i know
yes its funny
that story about the mountaineers
somebody from the deux moulins
not you
no
not mme suzanne
no
yes
look hes there again
yes how strange
and here
still him
lyon station
and here again
march 5 austerlitz
and still the same expression
isnt it  so neutral
12 times in total
i counted
its strange isnt it
why would he go across the whole
town to take photographs
and then throw them away
especially since theyre
in perfect condition
looks like some sort of ritual
maybe hes obsessed
by the fear of getting old
and this is his way to relax
hes dead
dead
hes afraid
of being forgotten
he uses those machines
to remind the living of his face
as if he were faxing
his image from the hereafter
a dead man whod be
afraid of being forgotten
well these ones dont
have to worry about that
they died long time ago
but theyll
never be forgotten
you know
that girl with the glass
maybe shes thinking about someone
somebody on the picture
no
rather a young man
she saw some place else
she feels like theyre
the same the two of em
she prefers to imagine a relationship
with somebody whos away
than to create bonds with
those who are there
no
maybe shes doing everything she can
to sort out other peoples lives
but her
her life
whos going to take care of that
in the meantime
its better to devote yourself
to others than to a gardendwarf
28 g of alcohol in his blood
for a chauffeur

what about your cousin the critic

theyre like the cactus
they live to sting
and your book

who keeps a diary
but instead of writing it

he writes the worstcase scenario
beforehand
as a result hes depressed
and he doesnt do anything
its the story of a guy
who doesnt do anything

he can only be seen
on photographs
when a girl has
her picture taken
he moans hooooooooooo
while he softly caresses
her neck
thats when hes caught by
the camera m quincampoix
who are you
page 51
do you
wish
to meet me
listen to this
a six year old boy
left at night
with his tricycle
he was found on a
motorway in germany
he just wanted to go
to where the stars are
ah life is so beautiful
dont you think
the love virus  shed
never caught that one before
nobodys safe
well i wont complain
shes looking great
how is she
tall short blonde brown
well lets say mediumsize
not a midget nor a giraffe
normal
pretty in her own way
but as for blonde or brown
i cant say
hard to tell
she certainly wasnt red
even though
forget it
on the other hand she did sort
of ask whether you had a girlfriend
and
i said that you were not interested
thats ok isnt it
you didnt say that did you
you dont even know her
exactly its the mystery
you wont find it here
some nectarines please
those are much more beautiful
mister here is an aesthete
in the evening he leaves
with the remainders
i was getting worried
but mister here takes
drawing classes
during the day he sells leek
and in the evening he draws potatoes
youre a real vegetable
a real good street prompter
ready to prompt
a stinging retort
thats the help shy people need
you youll never be
a vegetable
because even an artichoke
has a heart
youll never be a vegetable
because even an artichoke has a heart
memory 7

by accepting this training course

from my wife for 5 weeks
i think of you all the time
your adrien

of my last commission
in order to make up
for resigning so abruptly
i catch myself
dreaming of better days
orange days

to afford a car
that way ill be able
to come home every day
in the meantime i hope
youll come over friday night
and that well go out
the two of us
psychiatric emergency services
how can i help
where  when
one hour later
boulevard saintmartin
amélie steps into
a jokes and costume shop
at the same moment a man
leaves his home at lecourbe street
26 min later amélie arrives
at the photo machine at the gare de lest
at the same second
the man in red trainers
parks in front
of the side entrance
at that moment it is
exactly 1140am
at this exact moment in the story
amélie is the only one
to know the key to the enigma
of the mysteryman
of the photo machines
morning mrs walace
how are you
always better
when its not raining
here for you
for me
mrs walace
after the recent discovery
of a mailbag that was lost
when a plane disappeared
on the 12th of october 1969
la poste has the pleasure
to deliver to you a letter
that was addressed to you
please accept
all our apologies
for this unusual delay
jacques grosjean
head of the public relations department
mado my love
im in exile i cant sleep
i think about you all the time
i made the worst mistake
of my life
i gave up the money
and that woman
if everything works out i will
soon buy a house
i catch myself
dreaming of better days
that youll forgive me
and that youll come and join me
your adrien
whos always loved you so much
here m dufayel
youve got mail
m dufayel
you know what happened
to the caretaker this morning
a letter
from her husband
40 years late
quite a long time
isnt it m dufayel
thats cause i dont really like
still lifes m dufayel
in the meantime
take care over your light layer
its dark on light always
m dufayel
yes
the papers say that theres soon
gonna be a new star
youre interested in stars
i saw this show at my mums
thats why
but i dunno if its true
its the les americans
theyre gonna take the ashes
of rich dead people
to put them in a satellite
and send it into space
and its gonna shine forever
the satellite
and lady di
you think theyre gonna do the same for her
lady di
youre getting on my nerves
i cant concentrate
lady di
renoir
morning sir
cambodia
i dont get that
i dont get it
that was wonderful
you couldnt have done better
did it work
its running its course
well ill do it again any time
the harm is done anyway
quoi
they call me snow white
now
bar les 2
i am often
bar les 2 moulins
i am often there
after 4 pm
eva
yes
could you take over at 4pm please
oh youre pushing it
whats going on
is he sulking
he thinks i smile too much
he prefers when it when you frown
with other men yes
ninos late for amélie
theres only two possible explanations
1 he didnt find the picture
2 he didnt have time to piece it together
because 3 repeat offenders
took him hostage
chased by the police
they managed to escape
but he caused an accident
when he recovered
he couldnt remember anything
a trucker gave him a ride
and believing that he is a fugitive
put him in a container to istanbul
there he came across
afghan adventurers
who took him with them
to steal soviet missiles
but their lorry exploded
on a landmine in tajikistan
the only survivor mountaineers
helped him out
and he became
a mujaheddin fighter
thus amélie really doesnt see
why she should worry so much
for a guy wholl spend the
rest of his life eating bortsch
with a stupid hat
on his head
hi what can i get you
a coffee please
one coffee
heres your coffee
thanks
now hes understood
hes going to put down his spoon
and pick up the sugar
on the table with his finger
then hell turn around
and then hell talk to me
excuse me
is this you
yes thats you
let me clear the table for you
another coffee
no thanks im fine
so thats the one there
the guy who raises his hand
yes
is she in love with him
yes
the time has come for her
to take some real risks
well yes shes thinking about it
shes thinking of a stratagem
yes she likes stratagems
doesnt she
yes
shes a bit of a coward
thats why i have trouble
with her eyes
raymond dufayels meddling
is intolerable
if amélie prefers to
live in a dreamworld
and live her whole life
as an introvert its her right
because
making a mess of your life
is an indefeasible right
what are you doing m dufayel
tell me lucien my boy
for your deliveries
do you still have the keys
of the other tenants
good morning sir
one of your machines is out of order
er no but i think

of the lost steps
gare de lest
tuesday 5pm
just a second ive finished
the mystery man of the
photo machines wasnt a ghost
nor somebody obsessed by the fear
of ageing but the repairman
just a technician
doing his job thats all
excuse me
hes watching me like a dog
it drives me crazy
405pm public show
of feminine conspiracy
ow you look tense georgette
you look tense
courage its not easy
excuse me

i know its not you
where can i find her
shes at her fathers
it bothers me id like to
talk to you i finish at 6

there you are 408pm
the trap is set
and the blond guy with
the camelhair jacket
hes absentminded too

112 pm
camelhair
250 pm
camelhair
417 pm camelhair
stop it
my red patches are appearing
again look
mrs suzanne it starts again
hes gonna drive me crazy
dont start again
if she had a clear conscience
she wouldnt be upset
im going home
a psycho
thats the limit
georgette
are you done suffocating them
like that
a woman needs space to breathe
yes and then
she goes elsewhere
it can be good sometimes
oh you the writing failure
yes writing failure
a failure
i like this word failure
thats human destiny
hes getting pedantic
failure after failure
you make drafts and nothing more
lifes only an
endless repetition
yeah right
he didnt even come up with that himself
i do have ideas on my own you know
people always steal them from me
a bit like you with women
what does that mean
maybe you should
resign yourself
mind your own business you
yes what eh
stop it
whats going on here
georgette wanted to go for a walk
and joseph makes a fuss
a walk right
yes like gina
and the guy with the plastic bag
hold on i saw the whole process
first the little note in the pocket
at 408 pm so the guy comes back
today and there you go
they go for a walk
the problem is
you look nice to me
which means
the more i like a guy
the less hes structured mentally
id like to know more
ask me questions
what doesnt a swallow make
a swallow
a summer
and clothes
the man
when the cats away
the mice will play
slow and steady
wins the race
a rolling stone
gathers no moss
he that will steal a penny
will steal a pound
out of sight
out of mind
not bad
more
i think that those who know the proverbs
cant be bad persons
oh the pretty girl
from the 5th floor
ive got to tell you
do you believe in miracles
not today no
youll be surprised
some mountaineers
on the montblanc
discovered
hi lucien
do you have yeast
is it for miss amélie
yes
shes cooking right
collignon go fetch
amélie  amélie
amélie
go to the bedroom
miss poulain
all right amélie my girl
you dont have glass bones like me
you can knock against life
if you let this opportunity
slip away
then as time goes by
its your heart that will become
as dry and fragile
as my bones
so
go for it
for christs sake
i
