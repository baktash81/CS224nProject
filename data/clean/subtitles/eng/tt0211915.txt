14 670 times per minute  
  a blue fly
of the calliphorides species   
  landed in saint vincent street 
montmartre 
at the exact same second 
outside a restaurant   
  the wind was sweeping in
under a tablecloth   
  causing the glasses to dance
without anybody noticing it 
at the same time  on the fifth floor
of 28  avenue trudaine   
  eugène koler  erased the name
of his best friend  émile maginot   
  in his adress book
after coming home from his funeral 
still at the same second 
a spermatozoon  
  containing an x chromosome
and belonging to m  raphaël poulain  
  was reaching the ovum
of mrs poulain   
  born amandine fouet 
9 months later a girl was born   
  amélie poulain 
 amélie s father was a former
army doctor   
  and was working at the hydropathic
establishment of enghien les bains 
raphaël poulain doesn t like  
  peeing next to somebody else 
he doesn t like  
  noticing people laughing
at his sandals   
   coming out of the water with
his swimming suit sticking to his body
raphaël poulain likes  
  to tear big pieces of wallpaper
off the walls  
  to line up his shoes
and polish them with great care  
  to empty his toolbox   
  clean it thoroughly   
  and  finally  put everything away carefully 
amélie s mother  amandine fouet   
  was a primary school teacher
from gueugnon   
  she had always been
unstable and nervy 
she doesn t like to have her fingers
all wrinkled by hot water 
she doesn t like it when
 somebody she doesn t like  
  touches her   
  to have the marks of the sheets
on her cheek in the morning 
she likes the outfits of
the ice skaters on tv 
  to shine the flooring 
to empty her handbag  
  clean it thoroughly   
  and  finally  putting everything away carefully 
amélie is 6 years old 
she would like her father to hold her
in his arms from time to time 
but the only contact they have
is during the monthly medical check up 
moved by this intimacy 
the little girl  
  can t stop her heart
from beating wildly 
as a result   
  her father believes she suffers
from a heart disease 
because of this fictitious illness 
she doesn t go to school 
her mother acts
as her private tutor 
  the    chicken    often   
  hatch    in    the    convent  
  the chicken    
 very good 
 hatch often 
 no  
 with no contact with
other children   
  and mollycoddled by her parents   
  amélie s only refuge
is the world she makes up 
in that world  vinyls are made
the same way as pancakes   
  and the neighbour s wife  who has been
in a coma for months   
  just decided to do all
her sleeping at once 
 this way  i ll stay awake
night and day for the rest of my life 
 amélie s only friend
is called  the cachalot  
but the atmosphere at home turned it
into a neurasthenic and suicidal fish 
 since these suicide attempts
only increased her mother s stress   
  a decision is taken   
 enough    
 in order to comfort amélie   
  her mother gives her
a second hand kodak 
 what have you done 
 a neighbour makes her believe that
her camera causes accidents to happen 
since she s been taking pictures
 all afternoon   
  amélie finds herself in deep worry
in the evening 
she collapses in front of the televison 
feeling guilty   
  for a fire   
  2 derailments
and the crash of a boeing 747 
later on  amélie realizes
that the neighbour had made fun of her   
  and decides to take her revenge 
 but  what the   
you be careful 
 and then  one day 
 tragedy struck her 
like every year  her mother
had taken her to church to lit a candle  
  so that heaven would
send her a little brother 
the divine answer
came 3 minutes later
alas  it wasn t a newborn
that fell out of the sky  
  but a tourist from quebec 
determined to end her life 
amandine poulain  born fouet 
is killed outright 
after her mother s death   
  amélie finds herself alone
with her father 
the latter withdraws into himself
even more 
he starts to build
a miniature mausoleum   
  for the ashes of his beloved wife 
days  months 
then years go by   
the outside world seems so dull  
  that amélie prefers to dream her life
until she s old enough to leave 
5 years later  amélie is a waitress
in a bar in montmartre   
   les deux moulins  
today s 29 august   
  in 48 hours  the destiny of
amélie poulain will take a different turn 
but right now  she has no idea
of what s going to happen 
for her  life goes on
with her collegues and the regulars 
this is suzanne  the landlady 
she limps a little  but has
never spilled the slightest drop 
when she was young  she used to be
a horse dancer  she likes  
  sportsmen who cry
from disappointment 
she doesn t like it when a man
is humiliated in front of his kid 
the tobacconist is georgette 
the hypochondriac 
when it s not a migraine 
it s the sciatic nerve that s trapped 
she doesn t like to hear  
   le fruit de vos entrailles
est béni  
this is gina  amélie s colleague 
 granddaughter of a healer 
she likes to crack her fingers 
here you can see her bringing a kir
to hipolito  the not successful writer 
what he likes
is to see a bullfighter getting gored 
this is joseph 
gina s jealous ex lover 
he spies on her
to see if she s replaced him 
the only thing he likes  
  is to pop the bubbles
of plastic wrappings 
and finally  there s philomène 
the air hostess 
amélie looks after her cat
when she s away  she likes  
  the sound of the bowl with water on the floor 
as for the cat   
  he likes to listen to
children s stories 
 no thanks  ma am  
i never work on sundays 
 amélie often goes to see her father 
during the we  by train 
 why don t you enjoy your retirement  and   
 do what 
 travel 
you never left enghien 
 when we were young 
your mother and me   
  we d have liked to travel 
but we never could 
because of your heart 
 yes  i know 
 and now    
now   
 sometimes  amélie goes to the movies 
 i like to turn around in the dark
to see the faces of the people around 
and i also like to spot the little
detail nobody will ever see 
but i don t like it
when the driver doesn t watch the road 
 amélie doesn t have a boyfriend 
she tried  but it didn t
live up to her expectations 
on the other hand  she enjoys
all sorts of little pleasures   
  putting her hand
in a bag of seeds   
  piercing the crust
of crème brûlée  
  with the tip of a spoon 
and play at ducks and drakes
on the saint martin canal 
 this is the cristal man 
because of an illness  his bones
break like cristal 
all his furniture is fleece lined 
a hand shake is enough
to break his finger bones   
  so he never goes out 
time hasn t changed anything  amélie still
shelters in solitude  
  and asks herself silly questions
about the world or about this town 
for example  how many couples are
having an orgasm right now 
 fifteen   
 and finally  the night of
30 august 1997 
this is what will change
the life of amélie poulain totally 
  good evening 
the princess of wales  lady di
died this afternoon in a car crash 
she was with her friend   
only the first man to enter
the grave of toutankhamon  
  may understand how
amélie felt  
  when she discovered the treasure
that had been hid by a little boy 
on the 31st of august 
 at 4 in the morning  
  amélie suddenly has
a luminous idea 
she is going to find the owner
of this box  
  and return his treasure to him 
if he s moved  that s it  she ll
start to mingle with other people s lives 
if not  well  too bad 
 oh  the young missie of the 5th floor 
we don t often see you 
 excuse me  did a little boy use to live
in my flat in the 50ies  
 come in
and have a drink 
 no  thanks 
 yes  come in  close the door 
oh  kids   
i ve known so many 
at first  they re cute  and then
they start throwing snowballs  
i know 
 how long have you been here 
 since 64 
people must have told you 
 no 
sit down 
my husband used to work
 at coccinelle insurance 
people liked to say
he slept with his secretary 
they certainly did stop at
all the hotels in batignolles   
and not the little ones 
 cause the bitch
would certainly spread her legs   
  but only in satin cheets 
my husband started to steal
from his firm 
first only a little 
then 50 million at once 
and there they went  flew away  both of  em 
drink  
so  on january 20 1970   
  the doorbell rings  well   
 ma am  your husband died
in a car crash in south america  
my life just stopped 
black lion died of sorrow 
poor thing

  with love in his eyes

he s not a genius   
  but amélie likes him 
he holds the endives
as if they were precious   
   cause he likes a job well done 
 come on  look at him

a bird that s fallen from the nest

look at my oleanders 
 why  what 
 before the grocery 
he used to be a ticket puncher 
 what s wrong with that  
 at night  he gets up  
  and punches my oleanders 
 i d have preferred lilacs 
but that s life 
everyone his way to calm down 
 with me  it s ducks and drakes 
  ducks and drakes 
  there you are  
i write down everything 
 you write down what 
 your son s almost 50 
and i still do his accounting 
 when he was 15  you still got his

 bredoteau   
that s all i have to say 
 this young man who rummages
about under the photo machine  
  is called nino quincampoix 
amélie was denied the company
of other children   
  but little nino 
would rather have done without 
often  at the same moment 
9 km away from each other   
  one was dreaming about a sister
and the other about a brother   
  with whom they d play
all the time 
 hello  dad 
made yourself a new friend 
 no  i ve had it for ages 
but since your mother
hated it   
  i had put it away in the shed 
let s reconcile them with each other 
there  not bad  eh 
 say  dad 
if you found something from
your childhood  a treasure for you   
  would it make you happy  sad 
nostalgic  how would you feel 
 i didn t have the dwarf
when i was a kid 
it was a present
when i retired 
 no  the things you keep a secret
as if it was of great value 
 i should varnish it
before the fall 
 i m gonna make tea 
do you want some 
 don t move 
 you re ok  better 
 hey  close the door  
 it s not like siberia 
 you re not allergic
to carbon monoxyde 
i coughed so much last night
that my pleural membrane almost broke 
 yes  of course 
 what s the menu today 
 endive  au gratin 
 they ll bring you to your knees 
 so they re good 
 depends on where you fall   
true  if it s in the toilet  
 they re no good 
 12 15am  burst of laughter
reminiscent of an orgasm  
  to please the dominating male 
 i can t take it anymore 
 yes  true 
why does he insists 
there s other bars 
 goodbye 
mrs suzanne  
 yes  
 is there béchamel sauce 
in your endives 
 of course  why 
 béchamel sauce
doesn t agree with me 
just like horse meat for you 
 that s got nothing to do
with digestion  but with memories 
i d rather eat
human flesh

i don t want to meet
just anybody 
and there s only rascals out there 
but come in  there  come in   
you know 
they call me the cristal man 
but my name
is raymond dufayel 
amélie poulain  
i m a waitress   
 at the  deux moulins   i know 
and you re coming back empty handed  
  from your hunt for bretodeau 
because it s not  do  
it s  to  
like  toto  
 thanks 
i really like this painting 
 it s  the rower s lunch  
by renoir 
i paint one every year 
for 20 years now 
the hardest is the eyes 
sometimes  they change
their moods on purpose   
  when i m not looking 
 they look happy here 
 they better be 
this year  they had
 hare with morel  
  and waffles with jam
for the children 
let s see  where did i put  
  that little note 
i see you re looking at
my camera at the window 
it s a gift from my sister in law 
oh  i just put it there  this way  
  no need to wind up
my clock anymore 
after all these years   
  the only character i
can t quite figure out   
  is the girl with the glass of water 
she s in the middle  
  and yet  outside 
 maybe she s just
different from the others 
 how different 
 i don t know 
 as a kid  maybe she didn t often
play with other children 
maybe even never   
here you are 
dominique bretodeau 
27  rue mouffetard 
it s for you 
 this morning 
like every tuesday   
  dominique bretodeau goes out
to buy a chicken 
usually  he cooks it in the oven
with baked potatoes 
after cutting off the legs 
the breast and the wings   
  he ll clean up the bones
with his fingers   
  starting with the oyster 
no  bretodeau won t buy  
  a chicken today 
he won t go any further  
than that telephone booth 
there   
 in one second  bretodeau
remembers everything 
bahamontes  victory
in the tour de france 1959   
aunt josette s corselets   
and  especially 
that tragic day  
  when he won all the marbles
of his classmates during playtime 
 bretodeau  
 bretodeau   
the claw  bretodeau  
does he know it  the claw 
 one cognac  please 
i can t believe 
what just happened to me 
it must ve been my guardian angel 
can t be anything else 
it s as if
the telephone booth was calling me  
  it rang  and rang   
 well my 
there s the microwave calling 
 can i have another cognac 
it s weird  life 
when you re a kid 
time creeps slowly and then one day   
  you re 50 
and childhood 
whatever s left of it   
  fits into
a little rusty box 
you don t have children
yet  do you   
  miss 
i have a daughter 
she must be about your age 
we haven t spoken to each
 other for years now 
i heard she has a child 
a little boy 
his name is lucas 
it s about time
i went to pay them a visit  
  before i end up in a box myself 
don t you think 
 amélie suddenly feels
in perfect harmony with herself 
everything s perfect 
the softness of the light   
  that little scent in the air 
the peaceful sounds of the city   
life seems so simple
and cristal clear that she s swept  
  by this desire to help
the all mankind 
 i ll help you 
we go down and there we go 
there s the widow
of the drummer of the brass band 
hey  the horse s lost one ear 
the husband of florist is laughing 
there s lollipops
in the shop window 
can you smell his scent 
this man is offering melon
to his clients to taste 
there  they make
wonderful ice cream 
we re passing
in front of the butcher s 
ham on the bone costs 79  
here we re at the cheese merchant s   
12 90 for a picodon d ardèche  
at the butcher s   
  a baby s looking at a dog 
that s looking at the chicken 
here you are  now
we re at the metro station 
i ll leave you here  goodbye 
 she was never able to enter
into relationships with others    
 as a kid  she was
always on her own  
  on the evening of a bright
day in july   
  while holiday makers
enjoy themselves on the beach  
  in the carefreeness of the
sunny days and while in paris   
  the strollers  overcome by the heat
gaze at the trails of smoke  
  of the fireworks   
  amélie poulain  also known
as  the godmother of the rejected    
  or  the madonna of the cast offs 
succumbs to exhaustion 
in the streets of paris 
struck with grief   
  millions of mourning anonyms
gather for the funeral cortège  
  to show in silence  
  their great sorrow
of being forever orphans 
what a strange fate 
that of this young woman  
  deprived of herself   
  yet so sensitive to the charm
of the little things in life 
like don quichotte 
she was determined to grapple  
  the unforgiving grinder
of all the human sorrows 
an impossible fight
that consumed  
  her life prematurely 
at 23  amélie poulain  
  let her life deteriorate
in the swirls of universal pain 
and there she was struck by the regret
of having let her father die   
  without ever being able to give
back to this suffocated man  
  the breath of air
she d been able to give  
  to so many others 
 hey  mister  
hey  mister  
sir   
wait 
wait  
 pages
full of failed identity photos  
  that their owners had
thrown away  
  and that had been re assembled
and classified by some eccentric 
some family album 
 one gauloises blondes 
 there s so much smoke 
where are they 
i can t see anything 
 more to the left 
a bit further  there you are 
 there  thanks 
where are my 1f coins

 one moresque

and two and 2 peppermint cordials 
 that cooing  is it pre nuptial
or post coital  
 and your bloody stupidity 
is it congenital 
 pre nuptial 
 don t worry 
you ll find the right one in the end 
they all dream about sleeping
on a man s shoulder 
 i wouldn t mind 
but men snore 
i have a sensitive ear 
 i was operated  i got rid of it 
 how romantic  
 it s clear you ve never known
true love 
 if i hadn t known it  they wouldn t
have shortened my right leg 
 wasn t it a horse 
 yes  precisely 
i was in love
with a trapeze artist 
i should ve known  they dump you
at the last moment 
he dumped me
as i was going into the circus ring 
i was so upset 
and as a result  so was the horse 
unfortunately  i was under it 
right   the moresque 
 love at first sight  it does exists 
 i m not sayin  it doesn t 
but after 30 years behind the bar   
  i can even give you the recipe 
take two regulars  make them
believe they like each other   
  let it simmer  
  works every time 
 excuse me 
excuse me 
 no  
 i ll go 
don t you think you ve done
enough harm already 
 gina s old enough to
defend herself 
 i m not thinking about gina 
but about georgette 
 georgette  
 open your eyes  
she s hoping for you  
  and you re only looking at gina  
poor thing  
look at all she s doing  
  to try and attract
your attention 
you re blind  
 i m off  i have a date 
bye 
 goodbye 
 goodbye 
i don t know
how the new one will be   
  but ll never be worse than
that freak there with his tape recorder 
 joseph s not really a freak 
he s hurting  that s all 
 it s been two months
since they broke up   
  and he still shows up every day 
he likes to suffer

good night 
good morning   
 a swiss octogenarian has received
a letter 30 years later 
 the mail was found by
mountaineers on the mont blanc   
   in a bag
of the malabar princess   
  a plane that crashed
at the end of the 60ies  
 what a pity  
such a young and pretty princess   
 you mean  old and ugly 
that wouldn t have been that bad 
 well  yes    look at mother theresa 
and him 
still after gina  
 no  after somebody else 
 tell me 
is it someone i know  
 yes  it s funny 
that story about the mountaineers 
 somebody from the deux moulins  
not you 
 no  
 not mme suzanne   
no  
 yes  
look  he s there again 
 yes    how strange 
 and here 
  still him  
lyon station 
 and here  again 
march 5  austerlitz 
 and still the same expression 
isn t it   so neutral 
 12 times in total 
i counted 
it s strange  isn t it 
why would he go across the whole
town to take photographs   
  and then throw them away 
 especially since they re
 in perfect condition 
 looks like some sort of ritual 
 maybe he s obsessed  
  by the fear of getting old
and this is his way to relax 
 he s dead 
 dead 
 he s afraid
of being forgotten 
he uses those machines
to remind the living of his face 
as if he were faxing
his image from the hereafter 
 a dead man who d be
afraid of being forgotten   
well  these ones don t
have to worry about that 
they died long time ago 
but they ll
never be forgotten 
you know 
that girl with the glass   
  maybe she s thinking about someone 
 somebody on the picture 
 no 
rather a young man
she saw some place else 
she feels like they re
the same  the two of  em 
 she prefers to imagine a relationship
with somebody who s away   
  than to create bonds with  
  those who are there 
 no   
maybe she s doing everything she can
to sort out other people s lives 
 but her  
her life   
  who s going to take care of that 
 in the meantime   
  it s better to devote yourself
to others than to a garden dwarf 
 2 8 g of alcohol in his blood
for a chauffeur 
i m not the only one to employ
an irresponsible moron 
 m  collignon 
your keys   
 just a minute 
no rush 
look at lucien 
at work  there s no chance
he ll exceed the speed limits   is there 
 you shouldn t  m  collignon 
it s not his fault 
 you re right 
it s not his fault 
it s lady di s fault  
do you know
what i found this morning   
  the 3 suisses catalogue
open at the page with the nighties 
he d stuck the picture of lady di
on the bodies of the models 
so  this time 
a bunch of asparagus   
  or the neighbourhood records 
 nothing 
 keys while you wait 
 thanks  well  looks like those
migraines are gone 
 yes  but i haven t slept all
night because of my sciatic nerve 
 you re looking good  
 really  
 a woman without love  it s
like a flower without sun  it dies 
 strange weather today 
did i say something wrong 
 no 
everyone gives me the weather forecast 
 talking about the weather
to forget that time goes by 
 no  to avoid talking nonsense 
 you can write nonsense 
but not publish it   
 still nothing 
 30th rejection 
 what about your cousin  the critic 
 what do you think 
they re like the cactus  
  they live to sting   
 and your book  
is it a love story  
 no  it s about a guy
who keeps a diary 
but instead of writing it
as things happen   
  he writes the worst case scenario
beforehand 
as a result  he s depressed 
and he doesn t do anything 
 it s the story of a guy
who doesn t do anything

 listen to this 
 a six year old boy
left at night  
   with his tricycle 
 he was found on a
motorway in germany 
he just wanted to go
to where the stars are  
 ah  life is so beautiful 
 don t you think  
 the love virus     she d
never caught that one before 
 nobody s safe 
 well  i won t complain 
 she s looking great 
 how is she  
tall  short  blonde  brown 
 well  let s say medium size 
not a midget  nor a giraffe 
normal 
pretty  in her own way 
but as for blonde or brown 
i can t say  
hard to tell 
she certainly wasn t red 
even though   
 forget it 
 on the other hand  she did sort
of ask whether you had a girlfriend 
 and  
 i said that you were not interested 
that s ok  isn t it 
 you didn t say that  did you  
 you don t even know her  
 exactly  it s the mystery 
 you won t find it here  
 some nectarines  please 
 those are much more beautiful 
 mister here is an aesthete  
in the evening  he leaves
with the remainders   
  i was getting worried 
but mister here takes
drawing classes  
during the day he sells leek 
and in the evening  he draws potatoes  
you re a real vegetable   
 a real good street prompter  
  ready to prompt
a stinging retort   
  that s the help shy people need 
 you  you ll never be
 a vegetable   
  because even an artichoke
 has a heart 
 you ll never be a vegetable 
because even an artichoke has a heart 
  memory 7   
 mado my dear  your absence
gets more painful every day 
i m in exile in a grey world 
i can t sleep  i can t eat  
 i made the biggest mistake
by accepting this training course  
   that will keep me away
from my wife for 5 weeks 
i think of you all the time 
your adrien  
 i gave up the money
of my last commission  
   in order to make up
for resigning so abruptly 
 i catch myself
dreaming of better days 
 orange days 
do you remember  madeleine my love  
your adrien who s always
loved you so much  
 good news  i ll soon be able
to afford a car 
 that way i ll be able
to come home every day 
 in the meantime  i hope
you ll come over friday night  
  and that we ll go out 
the two of us  
  psychiatric emergency services 
 how can i help 
 where   when  
 one hour later 
boulevard saint martin  
  amélie steps into
a jokes and costume shop 
at the same moment  a man
leaves his home at lecourbe street 
26 min later  amélie arrives
at the photo machine at the gare de l est 
at the same second 
the man in red trainers  
  parks in front
of the side entrance 
at that moment  it is
exactly 11 40am 
at this exact moment in the story   
  amélie is the only one
to know the key to the enigma  
  of the mystery man
 of the photo machines 
  morning  mrs walace 
how are you  
 always better
when it s not raining 
 here  for you 
 for me  
 mrs walace 
 after the recent discovery
of a mailbag that was lost  
   when a plane disappeared  
on the 12th of october 1969 
 la poste has the pleasure
to deliver to you a letter  
   that was addressed to you 
please accept  
   all our apologies
 for this unusual delay 
jacques grosjean 
head of the public relations department  
 mado my love 
 i m in exile  i can t sleep 
i think about you all the time 
 i made the worst mistake
of my life 
 i gave up the money
and that woman 
if everything works out  i will
soon buy a house  
 i catch myself
dreaming of better days  
   that you ll forgive me
and that you ll come and join me 
your adrien
who s always loved you so much  
 here  m  dufayel 
you ve got mail 
m  dufayel   
  you know what happened
to the caretaker this morning  
 a letter 
 from her husband 
40 years late 
quite a long time 
isn t it  m  dufayel  
that s  cause i don t really like
still lifes  m  dufayel 
 in the meantime 
take care over your light layer 
it s dark on light  always 
 m  dufayel  
 yes 
 the papers say that there s soon
gonna be a new star 
 you re interested in stars 
 i saw this show at my mum s 
 that s why 
but i dunno if it s true 
it s the les americans   
they re gonna take the ashes
of rich dead people   
  to put them in a satellite 
and send it into space 
and it s gonna shine forever 
the satellite 
and lady di  
you think they re gonna do the same for her 
 lady di   
you re getting on my nerves   
i can t concentrate  
lady di   
renoir  
 morning  sir 
 cambodia   
i don t get that 
i don t get it 
 that was wonderful 
you couldn t have done better 
 did it work  
 it s running it s course 
 well  i ll do it again any time 
the harm is done anyway   
 quoi  
 they call me snow white 
now 
 bar  les 2    
 i am often    
 bar  les 2 moulins 
i am often there
after 4 pm 
 eva  
  yes  
 could you take over at 4pm please  
  oh  you re pushing it 
 what s going on 
is he sulking 
 he thinks i smile too much 
 he prefers when it when you frown 
 with other men  yes 
 nino s late  for amélie 
there s only two possible explanations
1  he didn t find the picture 
2  he didn t have time to piece it together  
  because 3 repeat offenders
took him hostage 
chased by the police   
  they managed to escape 
but he caused an accident 
when he recovered 
he couldn t remember anything 
a trucker gave him a ride  
  and believing that he is a fugitive 
put him in a container to istanbul 
there  he came across
afghan adventurers   
  who took him with them
to steal soviet missiles 
but their lorry exploded
on a landmine in tajikistan 
the only survivor  mountaineers
helped him out   
  and he became
a mujaheddin fighter 
thus  amélie really doesn t see
why she should worry so much  
  for a guy who ll spend the
rest of his life eating bortsch   
  with a stupid hat
 on his head  
 hi  what can i get you 
 a coffee  please 
 one coffee 
here s your coffee 
 thanks 
 now  he s understood 
he s going to put down his spoon   
and pick up the sugar
on the table with his finger 
then he ll turn around  
  and then  he ll talk to me 
 excuse me  
is this you  
yes  that s you 
 let me clear the table for you 
another coffee 
 no  thanks  i m fine 
 so that s the one  there 
the guy who raises his hand 
 yes 
 is she in love with him 
 yes 
 the time has come for her
to take some real risks 
 well yes  she s thinking about it 
she s thinking of a stratagem   
 yes  she likes stratagems 
doesn t she  
 yes 
she s a bit of a coward 
that s why i have trouble
with her eyes 
 raymond dufayel s meddling  
   is intolerable 
 if amélie prefers to  
 live in a dream world  
 and live her whole life
as an introvert  it s her right 
 because   
   making a mess of your life
is an indefeasible right  
 what are you doing  m  dufayel  
 tell me  lucien my boy   
  for your deliveries   
  do you still have the keys
of the other tenants  
 good morning  sir 
one of your machines is out of order 
er    no  but i think
there s something stuck 
gare de l est 
lounge of the lost steps

 be at the lounge
of the lost steps
gare de l est
tuesday 5pm 
 just a second  i ve finished 
 the mystery man of the
photo machines wasn t a ghost   
  nor somebody obsessed by the fear
of ageing  but the repairman 
just a technician
doing his job  that s all 
 excuse me   
 he s watching me like a dog 
it drives me crazy 
 4 05pm  public show
of feminine conspiracy 
 ow  you look tense  georgette 
you look tense 
courage  it s not easy 
 excuse me 
is this yours 
 yes  but it s not me who   
 i know it s not you 
where can i find her  
 she s at her father s 
it bothers me  i d like to
talk to you  i finish at 6 
can  you drop by  
 sure 
 see you later 
 there you are  4 08pm 
the trap is set 
 and the blond guy  with
the camelhair jacket 
he s absent minded too  
 what do you mean  
 he also came back 3 times 
1 12 pm   
 camelhair  
2 50 pm   
 camelhair  
4 17 pm     camelhair    
 stop it   
my red patches are appearing 
again  look 
mrs suzanne  it starts again  
he s gonna drive me crazy 
 don t start again 
 if she had a clear conscience
she wouldn t be upset 
 i m going home 
a psycho   
that s the limit 
 georgette  
are you done  suffocating them
like that 
a woman needs space to breathe 
 yes  and then 
she goes elsewhere 
 it can be good sometimes 
 oh you  the writing failure 
 yes    writing failure 
a failure   
i like this word   failure  
that s human destiny 
 he s getting pedantic 
failure after failure 
you make drafts and nothing more 
life s only an
 endless repetition 
 yeah  right 
he didn t even come up with that himself 
 i do have ideas on my own  you know 
people always steal them from me 
a bit like you with women 
 what does that mean 
 maybe you should
resign yourself 
 mind your own business  you   
 yes  what  eh    
 stop it 
 what s going on here 
 georgette wanted to go for a walk
and joseph makes a fuss 
 a walk  right 
yes  like gina
and the guy with the plastic bag   
hold on  i saw the whole process 
first the little note in the pocket
at 4 08 pm  so the guy comes back
today and there you go  
they go for a walk 
 the problem is 
you look nice to me 
 which means 
 the more i like a guy 
the less he s structured mentally 
i d like to know more 
 ask me questions 
 what doesn t a swallow make 
 a swallow  
a summer 
 and clothes 
 the man 
 when the cat s away   
 the mice will play 
 slow and steady   
 wins the race 
 a rolling stone   
 gathers no moss 
 he that will steal a penny   
 will steal a pound 
 out of sight   
 out of mind 
 not bad 
 more  
 i think that those who know the proverbs
can t be bad persons 
 oh  the pretty girl
from the 5th floor  
i ve got to tell you 
do you believe in miracles 
 not today  no 
 you ll be surprised
some mountaineers  
  on the mont blanc
discovered   
 hi lucien 
do you have yeast 
 is it for miss amélie  
 yes 
 she s cooking  right 
collignon  go fetch 
 amélie   amélie  
amélie  
  go to the bedroom 
miss poulain 
all right    amélie  my girl   
you don t have glass bones like me 
you can knock against life
if you let this opportunity
 slip away   
  then  as time goes by   
  it s your heart that will become   
  as dry and fragile  
  as my bones
so   
go for it 
for christ s sake 
 i
