we are the bad guys  we re
meant to do the killing

our reputation has been tarnished 
because these two idiots pretended
to be members of the axe gang 
easy  big boss  you are all upset 
you might miss and get even angrier 
anyhow  you are the boss here  let
your men do the dirty work 
do the dirty work  come on 
  boss  we got a lock picker here 
  sorry  that s what i do for a living 
alright  give the other one
a shot  if you re so hot 
on your marks   
now  you ll have till i count to three 
chop  chop 
ready  three 
i am impressed 
boss  i have always wanted
to be a member
of the famous axe gang 
please give us a chance  boss  
ever killed anybody 
not yet  no  but i
always wanted to 
then go out and kill someone 
that sounds like a great idea  doesn t it 
then go 
thank you  so much 
a bum like that can always come in handy 
i ve told you a hundred times 
you have to look tougher 
no  much more than that 
you have to really act the part 
and try to stay awake for once 
tough is tiring 
so what  that is part of the job 
take a look around you  the streets
are paved with money and women 
a little will and determination   
is all it takes to get your share  but
you have to grab the opportunity 
this is our big chance 
all we have to do is kill
someone  and we ll be like that 
then we ll have all the women
and money we want 
not like those bums back there   
they have no ambition  no
future  a bunch of losers 
what are you staring at  four eyes 
want me to smash your glasses 
hey  go to hell 
i dare you to say that again 
  you re really going to kill someone 
  of course i will  i m
gonna start with four eyes over here  then the
fat lady up in pig sty and all her neighbors 
yes  but their kung fu is unbeatable 
  unbeatable  you haven t seen me fight yet 
  you know kung fu 
didn t i tell you  i once learnt the
technique of buddhist palm 
hey there  young man 
wait a minute 
whoa  amazing  amazing 
do you know you have a
very special aura about you 
you re still a child  but you
have the bone structure   
and the chi flow of a kung fu genius 
if your chi flow can be channeled 
then you will be invincible 
remember the old saying 
you cannot escape your destiny 
the duty of upholding world peace
and punishing evil will be yours 
uh humm 
here  the buddhist palm manual of training 
it s priceless  but since this is fate 
i can let you have it for  10 
buddhist palm manual
  you gave him all the money you had 
  yes 
i had been saving it so i could
become a surgeon or a lawyer one day 
but this seemed like a
chance to save the world 
let her go 
oh  do it yourself kung fu 
the whole buddhist palm for 20 cents 
you must be loaded 
have you killed anyone lately 
the total idiot and the deaf
mute  what a bunch of losers 
i realized then that good guys
never win  i want to be evil 
i want to be a ruthless killer 
  lets get some ice cream 
  where 
wait  do you have vanilla 
i want chocolate 
what s the matter  have you
never seen an ice cream thief 
catch us if you can 
if you re such kung fu masters 
take your show on the road 
you belong in the circus  not in a respectable
neighborhood  i never want to see your ugly faces again 
don t be so hard on them  i m sure they
had a reason for doing what they did 
everyone has his reasons 
but causing trouble was
the last thing we wanted 
well  good for you  the
axe gang is serious 
we ll never hear the end of this 
why don t you clowns just get lost 
why is it that your wife
is always so nasty 
like a little massage 
masters 
we have nothing precious to offer   
   but our gratitude is infinite 
thank you for saving us 
stop sniveling  this isn t a funeral 
  how can you be so cold hearted 
  what s that  keep your mouth shut 
you may be good at kung fu 
but you re still a fairy 
is it a crime to know kung fu 
oh  she s gonna drown in her own
tears  once a pansy  always a pansy 
and what s with the red underwear 
is that something you can find in the night 
you d be better off in diapers 
what s wrong with red underwear 
when there was trouble  you simply took
off  while these guys saved our butts 
and now you re trying to chase them away 
i m grateful and you should try to be more
  appreciative 
  of what
every single one of you owes me
back rent   150   200   180 
you owe me  95  now pay up or pack up 
don t worry  guys  i ll pay the bill 
with what  tooth fairy 
what s it to you where i
get my money  you fat so 
  you little bitch 
  look who s talking 
calm down  landlady 
  you keep out of this  this is all your fault 
  you re like a tyrant 
look at her  she s turned her
back  she doesn t care 
how could you do that 
shut your mouth 
anyone who thinks they can out
yell me  had better think again 
the fat cow makes a lot of
noise  i m going to kill her 
watch this 
what happened 
can you do better  go on try it 
  to throw it 
  of course 
sorry  are you okay 
i think you should try to go a
little bit closer and take better aim 
i got it 
  who s throwing handles 
  uhh 
who did this to you 
it s missing a handle 
i know  but that doesn t
make it feel any better 
we should check for finger
prints  let s have a look   
  don t 
  i m sorry 
what are you trying to say 
i forgot that i have something
important to take care off  see you later 
uh no  she saw me 
don t make a move 
don t panic  snakes are controllable 
one little whistle and they will freeze 
please  spare me that 
oh  what the hell 
uh  you again  you pair of idiots 
go on  get back to business  what
are you standing around here for 
  let s split up 
  split what 
yes 
what are you doing here 
waiting for you  aren t you hurt 
i m fine 
where are the wounds 
did you see a doctor 
no  why 
  where have you been 
  i don t really know 
maybe it s better that way 
memories can be terribly painful  being
able to forget is a great blessing 
that s quite deep  you seemed
to have learnt a lot 
all the sorrows i ve had to endure   
i ve filled a river  now all
thoughts are sacred and pure 
hey  get out of the way 
yeah  move 
or i will kick your ass 
they look like grave diggers taking
one of their customers for a walk 
what idiots 
i don t want to be blamed
for making you leave 
so we will let buddha decide with
your ancestors spirits as witness   
it s all in the divining rods 
good stick you stay  bad stick you go 
horrifically bad fate
have some 
we are very glad that you have come 
we need some professional advice 
we know what your problems are 
one is from the hung school 
they call him the iron fist  those people
on pig sty alley are really good 
the other two are specialists of the
twelve kicks and hexagon staff 
but their warrior days are long over 
   yet  kung fu masters of their
level never seize to be a threat 
which makes this job that you have asked us
to perform for you  a great challenge for us 
what more can we ask 
i told you  these guys are number one  expensive  but
totally reliable  they are worth every penny they charge 
no 
the beast is number one  the evil spirit
of the fire cloud is the world s greatest killer 
he was so dedicated to practicing
kung fu that he lost his mind 
i have heard that he is held in an
asylum for the criminally insane 
which makes you the top
killers in circulation  right 
in actuality  we are nothing more
than a pair of street musicians 
our tunes will take hold of your soul 
and then slowly break your heart 
great  oh  that s like poetry 
don t you agree 
my friends  it is time to part 
i hope we will meet again someday 
i wish i had known we were colleagues 
i could have done with some company 
before we go our separate ways 
why don t we spar a little 
no  thank you  i still have lots
of packing to take care of 
  yeah  we all do 
  right 
twelve kicks of the tam school 
superb attack and defense 
the fist of iron  strong and subtle
at once  a great fist technique 
the woolang staff  a many
sided technique of mystical powers 
until we shall meet again 
lipstick again 
stay here  or i will break you in half 
sorry  but i am just closing up 
you can make a suit in no time 
but i am moving away 
this is good material 
ah  i see you know your cloth 
this is very high quality 
how high 
how high is the sky   
we ll show them what it
means to insult the axe gang 
we will kill them and turn this
place into a whore house 
you are blocking my view 
what s going on  ahh  forget it 
bullseye 
do not block my view 
damn it  i told those nit wits
to leave  but they are still here 
  really 
  they are 
what the hell is all that
racket down there  i got    
i m sorry  don t pay
any attention to her 
it s 4 o clock  i want to get
some sleep  get out of here 
shut up  you hag  it s time to die 
die  my ass 
don t listen to her 
you are still blocking the view 
hang in there 
be quiet 
give us a break  get out of here 
are you trying to kill us all 
  the view 
  i sense another master 
it was the roar  the lion s roar 
i thought it was a myth 
  why didn t you tell me that it really exists 
  shut up 
  that is the last we will see of them  right 
  hmm 
this is bad  boss 
get the car started  quick 
i told you to get   
what now 
keep it down  don t you have any manners 
these is a working class neighborhood 
people have to be at work late 
so get the hell out of my
sight  right now 
what a bunch of hoodlums 
it is no use  i cannot hold out much longer 
but having met true    masters like you   
   i can now die in peace 
don t say things like that  donut 
we are just an ordinary couple 
that is trying to live in peace 
fighting is futile 
where as a normal life  is all
that one should aspire to 
but you are so good at martial arts 
if only you d helped us earlier 
all this would never have happened  
everybody has his good reasons 
several years ago  my poor husband and i   
   we saw our only son
beaten to death in a fight 
revenge can be devastating 
do you understand what i am saying 
there is only one solution to the matter 
you must teach us all that you know   
help us become kung fu fighters
and we will avenge them 
but it takes years to reach the top 
being a fighter is not easy 
either you are born with
a calling  or you are not 
and the chances of that
are about one in a million 
it is obvious  i am the chosen one 
no  doesn t have what it takes 
listen  we swore that we would never fight
again  that we would rest our skills forever 
tonight we broke that solemn promise 
for your own good  why
don t you all just all go away 
with great power  comes great responsibility 
donut  you are badly hurt 
you must keep still 
this could be the end of
a beautiful    friendship 
no  donut  tomorrow is another day 
donut 
hey  there  four eyes 
i note that your tolerance for the
sight impaired is rather limited 
that s right  especially when
they re wearing gold frames 
i m a clerk  gold frames
look good on clerks  i like 
the way i look  so don t
hassle me  you little fool 
help me 
alley cats  mongrels  dogs  rats 
so much for your    so so so so 
come down here  and i ll shove your
glasses down your throat  you hear me 
you know damn well that
i would have done that 
was that a yes 
i would have 
you have no respect  you re
never there when i need you 
you sound like a wimp 
because of you we re
always getting beaten up 
we have nothing to show  no murder  no
rapes  no arson  no theft  no nothing   
i know all that because you
can t get your fat ass in gear 
what have i done to
deserve you as a partner 
lets go 
this is a stickup  where is the money 
where is the money  give it to me 
don t look at me like that 
i mean it 
i have killed people for less 
now get the money  go on 
it s in here 
let her go 
a total idiot and a deaf mute 
what a bunch of losers 
leave me alone 
you re just dead weight 
here take this  go home and raise
pigs  that is where you belong 
go on  before i kill you 
hey  kid  hey  what s your name 
there you go  buy yourself some new clothes 
you re now a member of the axe gang 
  are you serious 
  yes  and there s someone back here waiting for you 
brother sum 
when i first saw you  i knew you d
be a courageous man of many talents 
aha 
looking for an opportunity 
right 
i have an assignment for you 
for you i would eat fire 
 research for abnormal development  
what s that 
a nut house for crazies 
what is the army doing there 
those are not soldiers  they re boy scouts 
with tanks 
forget it  they are just models 
now when those scouts change the
guards  five minutes is all you will have 
you must follow these arrows
to the last cell  when you find it   
force the door  and get the man in there out 
here s your tool kit  five minutes  now go 
what about you 
we will be your lookouts  of course 
you have five minutes  get on with it 
the world s finest killer  the beast himself
is clearly dressed to suit his reputation 
that is only a label  do not worry 
we want two people killed and you re the
one who s going to do it  now what do you charge 
what do i charge 
i ve killed so many over the years  so
many just trying to find a worthy adversary 
that s why i stay in my cell  because
there was know one out there 
i would have escaped long ago
if i had found someone    if you
find me such an opponent  then  young friend 
i will make you an offer you cannot refuse 
   i will do it for free 
do you have someone 
yes  we have just what you are looking for  the
very best  this is gonna be the fight of the century 
would you mind demonstrating
some of your technique 
not that we don t trust you  we just
want to see what we are buying 
you fools are not worthy  i am
just wasting my time here 
  yes  boss
  he looks like refuge 
i agree  those sandals look totally worn out 
but a change of clothes will make him look 
  quite respectable 
  are you sure you brought the right one 
oh  yes  boss  i am certain  i swear i
followed your order to the letter 
mr beast  please show us a sample of
your technique  my careers on the line 
what do i care 
okay  old man  you see this 
have you ever gone up
against a fist this big 
i am almost afraid to use it  do
you realize the danger you re in 
really  try me  then 
see what i mean  is he conscious 
aha  and you say you can fight 
harder 
harder 
much harder 
if that is all you have to offer  how
can you call yourself a gangster 
do they make this for men 
in the world of kung fu 
speed determines the winner 
that leaves no doubt about
who our honored guest is 
your skill is unique  the axe
gang offers its respect 
the three true masters of kung fu 
only the world s top killer
exerts an honor like that   
   it cruds the air 
and what is that other aura telling me 
am i looking at the legendary
tragic couple  the great   
young beau   
i m the dragons daughter 
it is a great honor to be here 
we have come to eliminate the axe gang   
   and only the axe gang 
you should ve killed me
while you had the chance 
but it is too late  now that you
are here  you are doomed to die 
you are living on borrowed time 
your fate is sealed 
we brought you a gift
you cannot refuse 
what is this  a funeral bell 
ha  with the beast on our side 
we shall see for whom the bell tolls 
are you here on their behalf 
don t misunderstand me 
the only thing i m here for
is to kill the two of you   
   or for you to kill me 
if you have what it takes 
what is your opinion  dear 
in this world good cannot exist
along side with evil  such is destiny 
then that is the decision  shall we 
okay 
let s dance 
that s okay for starters 
now let s try again 
that was much better  but
you are still lacking precision 
the lion s roar 
wait 
know body told me the lion s roar
could be done through a loud speaker 
i concede my defeat 
looks like he s not up to it  this is our
big chance  get them while they are down 
you do it 
  i m gonna be sick  i need a doctor 
  go to hell 
you  come here 
  hit him 
  okay 
  on the head 
  yes  sir 
  hit him on the head 
  okay 
  now s your chance 
  right 
  go on 
  i will 
  smash him on the head 
  i will 
  on the head 
  i will 
beat him to a pulp 
what was that 
do you want me to beat him to
a pulp  or just smash him on the head 
you are totally confusing me 
wow  a pretty big fist you
have there  careful with that 
why did you hit me 
where are they  they are gone 
you re completely useless 
you let them get away 
i cannot be defeated  not in this world 
why did he try to save us 
these young people often make
mistakes when they are starting out 
we must forgive them  if
they make good in the end 
just look  beaten to
a pulp  the poor boy 
do you have a last
request  just tell us 
wait  wait  what are you writing 
i do not know this character  i
cannot understand  wait  wait 
no one here 
chinese medicine
it is truly a miracle he has survived this long 
your herbs are playing their part 
the herbs will help him along 
but the key lies within his own body 
all his bones are broken 
his tendons torn  it is
amazing he is recovering
so quickly  under normal
circumstances this would be impossible  unless   
unless of course   
you smell that 
you must not smoke while you are injured 
let me deal with this 
this makes no sense 
who would ever have thought that
the boy s chi flow would be released
by the beast s thrashing 
right  still we should have noticed earlier 
that he may be the greatest kung fu
genius to ever come along 
i wonder what i d be up to next 
so you re still alive  you traitor 
axes  forward 
the toe crusher 
that went out of style
when i left kindergarten 
our son would have been just about his age now 
if he is willing to make the effort  he
could surely become a doctor or a lawyer 
more likely a great kung fu fighter 
not bad  now what 
child s play  i can stop bullets   
huh  isn t that the toad technique of the kwan lun 
i m afraid so 
do you remember the buddhist technique
of the palm descending from heaven 
the long lost art we all
thought was forever gone 
i surrender 
what s the name of your technique 
do you want to learn  i will teach you 
master 
hey  tell your son not
to smear his snot on the glass 
you two  don t put your
pants down in here 
hey  if you re licking 
you have to buy it 
sonny  you have the structure
of the chi flow of a kung fu genius 
upholding world peace is in your
hands  the buddhist palm manual 
since it s fate  you can have it for  10
