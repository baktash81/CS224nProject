thank you so much
a bum like that can always come in handy
ive told you a hundred times
you have to look tougher
no much more than that
you have to really act the part
and try to stay awake for once
tough is tiring
so what that is part of the job
take a look around you the streets
are paved with money and women
a little will and determination
is all it takes to get your share but
you have to grab the opportunity
this is our big chance
all we have to do is kill
someone and well be like that
then well have all the women
and money we want
not like those bums back there
they have no ambition no
future a bunch of losers
what are you staring at foureyes
want me to smash your glasses
hey go to hell
i dare you to say that again
youre really going to kill someone
of course i will im
gonna start with foureyes over here then the
fat lady up in pigsty and all her neighbors
yes but their kungfu is unbeatable
unbeatable you havent seen me fight yet
you know kungfu
didnt i tell you i once learnt the
technique of buddhist palm
hey there young man
wait a minute
whoa amazing amazing
do you know you have a
very special aura about you
youre still a child but you
have the bone structure
and the chiflow of a kungfu genius
if your chiflow can be channeled
then you will be invincible
remember the old saying
you cannot escape your destiny
the duty of upholding world peace
and punishing evil will be yours
uhhumm
here the buddhist palm manual of training
its priceless but since this is fate
i can let you have it for 10
buddhist palm manual
you gave him all the money you had
yes
i had been saving it so i could
become a surgeon or a lawyer one day
but this seemed like a
chance to save the world
let her go
oh do it yourself kungfu
the whole buddhist palm for 20cents
you must be loaded
have you killed anyone lately
the total idiot and the deaf
mute what a bunch of losers
i realized then that good guys
never win i want to be evil
i want to be a ruthless killer
lets get some ice cream
where
wait do you have vanilla
i want chocolate
whats the matter have you
never seen an ice cream thief
catch us if you can
if youre such kungfu masters
take your show on the road
you belong in the circus not in a respectable
neighborhood i never want to see your ugly faces again
dont be so hard on them im sure they
had a reason for doing what they did
everyone has his reasons
but causing trouble was
the last thing we wanted
well good for you the
axe gang is serious
well never hear the end of this
why dont you clowns just get lost
why is it that your wife
is always so nasty
like a little massage
masters
we have nothing precious to offer
but our gratitude is infinite
thank you for saving us
stop sniveling this isnt a funeral
how can you be so coldhearted
whats that keep your mouth shut
you may be good at kungfu
but youre still a fairy
is it a crime to know kungfu
oh shes gonna drown in her own
tears once a pansy always a pansy
and whats with the red underwear
is that something you can find in the night
youd be better off in diapers
whats wrong with red underwear
when there was trouble you simply took
off while these guys saved our butts
and now youre trying to chase them away
im grateful and you should try to be more
appreciative
of what
every single one of you owes me
backrent 150 200 180
you owe me 95 now pay up or pack up
dont worry guys ill pay the bill
with what tooth fairy
whats it to you where i
get my money you fatso
you little bitch
look whos talking
calm down landlady
you keep out of this this is all your fault
youre like a tyrant
look at her shes turned her
back she doesnt care
how could you do that
shut your mouth
anyone who thinks they can out
yell me had better think again
the fat cow makes a lot of
noise im going to kill her
watch this
what happened
can you do better go on try it
to throw it
of course
sorry are you okay
i think you should try to go a
little bit closer and take better aim
i got it
whos throwing handles
uhh
who did this to you
its missing a handle
i know but that doesnt
make it feel any better
we should check for finger
prints lets have a look
dont
im sorry
what are you trying to say
i forgot that i have something
important to take care off see you later
uhno she saw me
dont make a move
dont panic snakes are controllable
one little whistle and they will freeze
please spare me that
oh what the hell
uh you again you pair of idiots
go on get back to business what
are you standing around here for
lets split up
split what
yes
what are you doing here
waiting for you arent you hurt
im fine
where are the wounds
did you see a doctor
no why
where have you been
i dont really know
maybe its better that way
memories can be terribly painful being
able to forget is a great blessing
thats quite deep you seemed
to have learnt a lot
all the sorrows ive had to endure
ive filled a river now all
thoughts are sacred and pure
hey get out of the way
yeah move
or i will kick your ass
they look like grave diggers taking
one of their customers for a walk
what idiots
i dont want to be blamed
for making you leave
so we will let buddha decide with
your ancestors spirits as witness
its all in the divining rods
good stick you stay bad stick you go
horrifically bad fate
have some
we are very glad that you have come
we need some professional advice
we know what your problems are
one is from the hung school
they call him the iron fist those people
on pigsty alley are really good
the other two are specialists of the
twelve kicks and hexagon staff
but their warrior days are long over
yet kungfu masters of their
level never seize to be a threat
which makes this job that you have asked us
to perform for you a great challenge for us
what more can we ask
i told you these guys are number one expensive but
totally reliable they are worth every penny they charge
no
the beast is number one the evil spirit
of the fire cloud is the worlds greatest killer
he was so dedicated to practicing
kung fu that he lost his mind
i have heard that he is held in an
asylum for the criminally insane
which makes you the top
killers in circulation right
in actuality we are nothing more
than a pair of street musicians
our tunes will take hold of your soul
and then slowly break your heart
great oh thats like poetry
dont you agree
my friends it is time to part
i hope we will meet again someday
i wish i had known we were colleagues
i could have done with some company
before we go our separate ways
why dont we spar a little
no thank you i still have lots
of packing to take care of
yeah we all do
right
twelve kicks of the tam school
superb attack and defense
the fist of iron strong and subtle
at once a great fist technique
the woolang staff a many
sided technique of mystical powers
until we shall meet again
lipstick again
stay here or i will break you in half
sorry but i am just closing up
you can make a suit in no time
but i am moving away
this is good material
ah i see you know your cloth
this is very high quality
how high
how high is the sky
well show them what it
means to insult the axe gang
we will kill them and turn this
place into a whore house
you are blocking my view
whats going on ahh forget it
bullseye
do not block my view
damn it i told those nitwits
to leave but they are still here
really
they are
what the hell is all that
racket down there i got
im sorry dont pay
any attention to her
its 4 oclock i want to get
some sleep get out of here
shut up you hag its time to die
die my ass
dont listen to her
you are still blocking the view
hang in there
be quiet
give us a break get out of here
are you trying to kill us all
the view
i sense another master
it was the roar the lions roar
i thought it was a myth
why didnt you tell me that it really exists
shut up
that is the last we will see of them right
hmm
this is bad boss
get the car started quick
i told you to get
what now
keep it down dont you have any manners
these is a working class neighborhood
people have to be at work late
so get the hell out of my
sight right now
what a bunch of hoodlums
it is no use i cannot hold out much longer
but having met true masters like you
i can now die in peace
dont say things like that donut
we are just an ordinary couple
that is trying to live in peace
fighting is futile
where as a normal life is all
that one should aspire to
but you are so good at martial arts
if only youd helped us earlier
all this would never have happened
everybody has his good reasons
several years ago my poor husband and i
we saw our only son
beaten to death in a fight
revenge can be devastating
do you understand what i am saying
there is only one solution to the matter
you must teach us all that you know
help us become kungfu fighters
and we will avenge them
but it takes years to reach the top
being a fighter is not easy
either you are born with
a calling or you are not
and the chances of that
are about one in a million
it is obvious i am the chosen one
no doesnt have what it takes
listen we swore that we would never fight
again that we would rest our skills forever
tonight we broke that solemn promise
for your own good why
dont you all just all go away
with great power comes great responsibility
donut you are badly hurt
you must keep still
this could be the end of
a beautiful friendship
no donut tomorrow is another day
donut
hey there foureyes
i note that your tolerance for the
sightimpaired is rather limited
thats right especially when
theyre wearing goldframes
im a clerk gold frames
look good on clerks i like
the way i look so dont
hassle me you little fool
help me
alley cats mongrels dogs rats
so much for your sosososo
come down here and ill shove your
glasses down your throat you hear me
you know damn well that
i would have done that
was that a yes
i would have
you have no respect youre
never there when i need you
you sound like a wimp
because of you were
always getting beaten up
we have nothing to show no murder no
rapes no arson no theft no nothing
i know all that because you
cant get your fat ass in gear
what have i done to
deserve you as a partner
lets go
this is a stickup where is the money
where is the money give it to me
dont look at me like that
i mean it
i have killed people for less
now get the money go on
its in here
let her go
a total idiot and a deaf mute
what a bunch of losers
leave me alone
youre just dead weight
here take this go home and raise
pigs that is where you belong
go on before i kill you
hey kid hey whats your name
there you go buy yourself some new clothes
youre now a member of the axe gang
are you serious
yes and theres someone back here waiting for you
brother sum
when i first saw you i knew youd
be a courageous man of many talents
aha
looking for an opportunity
right
i have an assignment for you
for you i would eat fire
research for abnormal development
whats that
a nuthouse for crazies
what is the army doing there
those are not soldiers theyre boy scouts
with tanks
forget it they are just models
now when those scouts change the
guards five minutes is all you will have
you must follow these arrows
to the last cell when you find it
force the door and get the man in there out
heres your tool kit five minutes now go
what about you
we will be your lookouts of course
you have five minutes get on with it
the worlds finest killer the beast himself
is clearly dressed to suit his reputation
that is only a label do not worry
we want two people killed and youre the
one whos going to do it now what do you charge
what do i charge
ive killed so many over the years so
many just trying to find a worthy adversary
thats why i stay in my cell because
there was know one out there
i would have escaped long ago
if i had found someone if you
find me such an opponent then young friend
i will make you an offer you cannot refuse
i will do it for free
do you have someone
yes we have just what you are looking for the
very best this is gonna be the fight of the century
would you mind demonstrating
some of your technique
not that we dont trust you we just
want to see what we are buying
you fools are not worthy i am
just wasting my time here
yes boss
he looks like refuge
i agree those sandals look totally worn out
but a change of clothes will make him look
quite respectable
are you sure you brought the right one
oh yes boss i am certain i swear i
followed your order to the letter
mr beast please show us a sample of
your technique my careers on the line
what do i care
okay old man you see this
have you ever gone up
against a fist this big
i am almost afraid to use it do
you realize the danger youre in
really try me then
see what i mean is he conscious
aha and you say you can fight
harder
harder
much harder
if that is all you have to offer how
can you call yourself a gangster
do they make this for men
in the world of kungfu
speed determines the winner
that leaves no doubt about
who our honored guest is
your skill is unique the axe
gang offers its respect
the three true masters of kungfu
only the worlds top killer
exerts an honor like that
it cruds the air
and what is that other aura telling me
am i looking at the legendary
tragic couple the great
young beau
im the dragons daughter
it is a great honor to be here
we have come to eliminate the axe gang
and only the axe gang
you shouldve killed me
while you had the chance
but it is too late now that you
are here you are doomed to die
you are living on borrowed time
your fate is sealed
we brought you a gift
you cannot refuse
what is this a funeral bell
ha with the beast on our side
we shall see for whom the bell tolls
are you here on their behalf
dont misunderstand me
the only thing im here for
is to kill the two of you
or for you to kill me
if you have what it takes
what is your opinion dear
in this world good cannot exist
along side with evil such is destiny
then that is the decision shall we
okay
lets dance
thats okay for starters
now lets try again
that was much better but
you are still lacking precision
the lions roar
wait
know body told me the lions roar
could be done through a loud speaker
i concede my defeat
looks like hes not up to it this is our
big chance get them while they are down
you do it
im gonna be sick i need a doctor
go to hell
you come here
hit him
okay
on the head
yes sir
hit him on the head
okay
nows your chance
right
go on
i will
smash him on the head
i will
on the head
i will
beat him to a pulp
what was that
do you want me to beat him to
a pulp or just smash him on the head
you are totally confusing me
wow a pretty big fist you
have there careful with that
why did you hit me
where are they they are gone
youre completely useless
you let them get away
i cannot be defeated not in this world
why did he try to save us
these young people often make
mistakes when they are starting out
we must forgive them if
they make good in the end
just look beaten to
a pulp the poor boy
do you have a last
request just tell us
wait wait what are you writing
i do not know this character i
cannot understand wait wait
no one here
chinese medicine
it is truly a miracle he has survived this long
your herbs are playing their part
the herbs will help him along
but the key lies within his own body
all his bones are broken
his tendons torn it is
amazing he is recovering
so quickly under normal
circumstances this would be impossible unless
unless of course
you smell that
you must not smoke while you are injured
let me deal with this
this makes no sense
who would ever have thought that
the boys chiflow would be released
by the beasts thrashing
right still we should have noticed earlier
that he may be the greatest kungfu
genius to ever come along
i wonder what id be up to next
so youre still alive you traitor
axes forward
the toe crusher
that went out of style
when i left kindergarten
our son would have been just about his age now
if he is willing to make the effort he
could surely become a doctor or a lawyer
more likely a great kungfu fighter
not bad now what
childs play i can stop bullets
huh isnt that the toad technique of the kwan lun
im afraid so
do you remember the buddhist technique
of the palm descending from heaven
the long lost art we all
thought was forever gone
i surrender
whats the name of your technique
do you want to learn i will teach you
master
hey tell your son not
to smear his snot on the glass
you two dont put your
pants down in here
hey if youre licking
you have to buy it
sonny you have the structure
of the chiflow of a kungfu genius
upholding world peace is in your
hands the buddhist palm manual
since its fate you can have it for 10
