for a travel agency
but what the hey
like an arrow maybe
yeah like an arrow
maybe
but see then the other aspect
is stability
a company that you can trust
so if you can balance those ideas
in a way thats pleasing to the eye
then you got a logo
okay movement stability
and an arrow
okay ill think of something for that one

besides danis got summer school
till labor day
is it really that critical
that she cant miss two damn weeks
you know
the alternative was to expel her
maybe this drama teacher from the college
will get her excited about something
yeah about him probably
whyd they have to make such a stink
like she was on heroin or something
i mean whats marijuana
you and i smoked a little dope in our time
in some cultures
its considered almost a sacrament
i realize in ours its forbidden
right up there with incest
and necrophilia and bestiality
honey
worship of idols cannibalism
do that again
what
do that again
sam somebodys out there

you know hes probably upset
at the lawyer
yeah your clientele

on her walks in the woods
till ive started a few things
maybe even talk to the boss
what if she takes benjamin with her
big ben our guard dog
whats he gonna do lick him to death
just tell her
what i hardly know anything about him
i dont mean his biography
just theres some creep around
if you see him again
call the cops and then call me
what about a weapon
in case things get exciting around here
would you feel more secure
with a loaded gun in the house
wed end up using it on each other
or dani would he wont do anything
he just got out of prison
he doesnt want to go right back
call lee heller
lee is a colorful character but hes still
the best criminal lawyer in the state
good
get me lee heller
sam you defended this guy right
right
what makes you think
he wants to harm you
yesterday i was getting in my car
the guy comes up
we have a conversation
he says to me
youre gonna learn about loss
thatd hardly qualify
under the terrorist threat statutes
tom for christs sake the guys an excon
you know as well as i do what that means
last night there he was behind our house
attempted b and e
no not exactly
he was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property
thats not even trespassing sam
come on what can i say
get a restraining order
i filed one this morning
the hearings in ten days
good anything i can do
tom fourteen years ago
in this case i had a report on the victim
it was a rape case
thats right
rape and aggravated sexual battery
anyway i had a report on this victim
and it came back
that she was promiscuous
and
i buried it
anybody else know about this
no i buried it
i didnt show it to the client
or the prosecution
but if you had seen
what this guy had done to this girl
in every criminal prosecution
the accused shall have
the assistance of counsel
for his defense
i know the sixth amendment
i believe in it
thats why i left
the public defenders office
there was no way to serve the law
in that capacity
some folks dont have the right
to the best defense
of course they deserve the best defense
but if you had seen what he did
to this girl
buried the report
lf it was your own daughter
yeah i mean
buried the report
jesus sam
oh god
but i dont see how he could know that
he was illiterate
i had to read everything to him
the probable cause affidavit
the arrest reports everything
theres no way he could know that
hey dani
its so quiet out here
and the lights so perfect
why dont you get your book
and come out here and read
why
i told you why
is it because hes like a flasher
or just a peeper
what do you know about that a flasher
you dont think ive been flashed before
i didnt mean to insult you
im sure youve been flashed
if you want to come out come on out
if you dont go on
do whatever you want
but dont go outside
afternoon counselor
what do you want mr cady
theyre great at that age aint they
all those discoveries ahead of them
youre lucky
my own daughter
she dont even know me
after i went inside
her mama told her i was dead
which in a way i was
mr cady i realize that you suffered
i understand your problem
but i mean why me
i was your lawyer i defended you
why not badger the da or the judge
badger
why not them
best i remember
they was just doing right by their jobs
i didnt do my job is that right
i pleaded you out
to a lesser occluded offense
you couldve gotten rape
instead of battery
id have been up for parole in seven years
according to georgia penal code
rape is a capital offense
you couldve gotten life death
you could be sitting
on death row right now
i learned to read during my stretch
first spot goes to the farm
then runaway bunny
then law books mostly
did you know after i discharged you
i acted as my own attorney
applied several times for an appeal
no i didnt know that
so here we are
two lawyers for all practical purposes
talking shop
how much do you want mr cady
how much do i want what
how much money do you want
money
counselor do i look destitute to you
im open to discussion
within reasonable limits
you ever been a woman
a what
a woman
some fat hairy ugly hillbillys wet dream
i realize that you suffered
theres no question about that
you dont know
what suffering is counselor
like it says in galatians 3
have ye suffered so many things in vain
i learned from the getgo in the joint
to get in touch with my feminine side
im open to some sort of discussion
on compensation
what shall be my compensation sir
for being held down and sodomized
by four white guys
or four black guys
shall my compensation be the same
what is the formula for compensation sir
how about 10000 in cash
do i
lets just break that down
that figure just came
to the top of my head
for arguments sake
lets say 20000 30000
ill tell you what lets say 50000
50000 into fourteen years
fourteen years times 365 days
is about 5000 days
you divide that by 50000
and thats like 10 a day
thats not even minimum wage
to say nothing about the family
and respect that i lost
i dont think you really understand
what were talking about
fourteen years
whoops
gotta git
im late for another appointment
i got some good news
i got the bank the account number
ill call your soninlaws lawyer
tell him were going to court
mr bowden your wifes on line one
ask her to hold i have to make a call
i wouldnt make that call the way id
mr bowden
she says its urgent
yeah
these kind of horrible
highpitched howls
they sounded like he was screaming
and then dani came running in and i
i called the vet
then it was so weird because
it was like he was winding down
just winding down like an old clock
then all of a sudden he just stopped
he had this kind of
his eyes just wide open
and this kind of
surprised look
and then
then he died
he just died before the vet even got here
what did the vet say
that he was poisoned
poisoned
what kind of poison
i dont know what kind of poison
jesus i told you not to let him out
i didnt let him out
then how
stop
ive got an english setter myself
so i dont cotton to dog killers
trouble is poisoning a dog is just a fine
but if hes unemployed
he has to have money
or well bust him for vagrancy
well give him a fullbody strip search
jerk a knot in his tail
all right
they got so many ways on the books
to lean on an undesirable
hell feel about as welcome
around here as a case of yellow fever
hands against the wall
spread them
that him
face the wall
oneway mirror mr bowden
he doesnt know youre here
yeah thats him
get the shirt off
come on hurry up
just pass it over to him
hand it to me
knock off the shoes
hand them to the other officer
pass them to him come on
put the arms out
put your arms out straight
roll your palms
do what he says
turn around slow
i dont know whether
to look at him or read him
stand still
one more step for you
you know the routine
against the wall
we searched his apartment
car registration and everythings in order
theres no guns or any other weapons
but we found these
cadys savings account
yeah his mother died
while he was serving
the farm got sold off
he got the proceeds
hes got money
where does that leave us
at the very least we nail him
for the dog what happened
you let the dog out cady abducted him
we didnt let the dog out
cady came into your house
thats illegal entry with intent
but he didnt come in the house
im not a cop
i dont know exactly how he did it
i just know that he did it somehow
thats not good enough mr bowden
youre a lawyer
you damn well know that
get off the pants
sooner or later hes gonna screw up
the sheriff assured me
that they always do hes an excon
hes going to get the message
in no uncertain terms
id still like to kill him
how come you didnt join up with them
you can tap
you can tap dance
i wanted to once but i dont know
son of a bitch
what
hes staring at you
what are you talking about
what the hell are you doing
hot as a firecracker on the 4th of july
youre damn lucky to have her boy
you son of a bitch
where did he go
watch my arm it might be broke
whats with you you have no right
to be pushing me around like that
i was just watching the parade
i wasnt pranking on nobody

the fellow with the tie
his wife took him away
i think he really hurt his arm
mom
strong drink you got there mister

and youll be fine
you seem to be having a good time
ive been practicing
practicing for what
how to fall on the floor
a life of debauchery
debauch what
debauchery its a threesyllable word
making fun of me
thats okay no problem
i made you blush
blush
yes youre now the color
of your shirt scarlet
i had no business getting
stuck on a guy who was married
you certainly did not
i dont know what i was thinking
god only knows
arent i the bozo on this bus
oh god lest you think that i slept
with this particular married guy
thats your business not mine
i dont want to make it sound like
ive been through a busload of them
thats the way it sounded to me
he was the first
oh yeah
he was i swear
oh yeah
oh boy
tell it to the judge
actually the rat stood me up today
did he
yes
what a shame
i know
so now its my turn where are you from
where am i from
youre gonna love this
yes
im from the georgia state
correctional facility
you think im joking thats the truth
i just got released from prison
my god this is the way
my day has been turning out
actually it reminds me of a joke
do you want to hear it
tell me liven up the night
an unmarried woman
wait a minute thats not it
come on get the joke straight
shut up let me do it
an unmarried woman meets a guy
and he tells her he just got out of prison
what did you do she asks
i hacked my wife into 52 pieces
with a chain saw
she says so youre single
thats even funnier
thank you
could i ask you something
what
what did you do
i knew you were going to ask
i hacked my wife into 52 pieces
i was afraid youd say that
im a very small person so maybe
maybe i can hack you into 40 pieces
what did you do really
no really but what did you do
there was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant and
when they came to arrest us
this macho sheriff got rough
with the lady behind me
i popped the bastard
so they gave me a little time for it
im drinking a sea breeze
i hope you can afford them
you have to stay sober if you aint
sober youre taking your chances
because im just one hell of an animal
yeah do tell
get you on this side doll lets do this
who is loretta anyway
thats the love of my life
shes no longer with us
i thought i was the love of your life
chopped her into 52 pieces
he hurt you like this that married guy
he hurt you like this
i told you we never did anything
he hurt you like this
oh scandal
hes a rough one
hows this feel
oh my god am i under arrest
not quite darlin
officer i swear its all a mistake
that married guy hurt you like this
because what he did to me
hurt a lot worse than this
ive got you now bitch
dani when did this key stop working
what oh i dont know
no wonder a wires missing
a piano wire is missing was somebody
fooling around with the piano
what
yeah
mr bowden
i think we might have a little break
good
i can be there in a half hour
all right fine thank you
who was that
cady raped another girl
rape you said it was battery
the case was wobbly i got it reduced
i remember those days old slippery sam
im sorry
i just didnt want to alarm you or dani
why how old was that girl
16 what
my birthday is coming up
neighbors heard screams and called us
when the perp drove off
somebody made his plate
max cady
great
we got one little problem
the girl is scared
shes claiming she fell down some stairs
dont look at me
oh my god
you two know each other
yeah we work together
ill be outside
im so stupid
you stood me up at the club the other day
then you didnt call
by last night
i was feeling pretty reckless
i thought about what you said you know
that your wife didnt know i existed
and i felt like
i was going to show you
i guess i showed you all right didnt i
i guess i really showed you
listen to me okay
now look this guy cady
hes done this kind of thing before
now hes going to do this
over and over again
unless you testify
and we take him to court
no
and press charges and testify
i know how it works i see it every day
only this time im on the other side
i dont want to explain why i was in a bar
and how much i had to drink
and what i was wearing
not by the people i work with
not by the guys that i see
crossexamine other people on the stand
just crucify them
they just laugh about it later
theyll even ask about you
listen to me i dont care about that
well i care about that
im sure you do too
im terribly sorry im just terribly sorry
if this is something personal
between you the girl and cady
personal
all right come on lieutenant
what are you implying
only that there are some things
that are better handled quietly
not by the police
this cady is planning to rape my wife
but its not your problem
i cant bust someone for planning a rape
youre a lawyer
you know that damn well
thanks
the way id handle it
what file a restraining order
i already did
just think of cady as a tiger
the trick is to get him out of the brush
how do we do that
you stake out a couple of your goats
and hide in a tree
what are you suggesting
that i use my family as bait
and then what
hope that this psychopath
attacks my wife and child
then what blow his head off
im a law officer
it would be unethical of me to advise a
citizen to take the law into his own hands
i suppose you mustve misunderstood me
i guess i mustve
well pardon me all over the place
and hes been harassing my family
cleverly so that the law cant touch him
i believe hes able to slip
in and out of the house undetected
although is he out i cant tell
hes either out or in im not sure
i cant see through walls
im not asking you to see through walls
thats fine
why cant anybody do anything for me
what good are cops and laws
sam calm down
let me explain something to you
the system is set up to handle
generalized problems
like burglary and robbery
but if some lone creep targets you
for some obscure reason
the system is slow and skeptical
pathetic even
whats your connection with this fellow
i was his lawyer his public defender
but you shafted him somehow right
at least thats the way he perceives it
i dont care what you did
what did he do
he raped a 16yearold girl
do you have a daughter around 16
shes 15
heres the deal
ill do a background check
follow him and write up a risk assessment
great now the cops
i can find him
his names max cady
just take it easy stay calm
dani you can just relax because
your daddy has a private investigator
on the payroll
isnt that right
whats your feeling about him
what sam spade
mickey spillane peter gunn
dirty harry perry mason
no perry mason was a lawyer
the minute i walked in
this guys office i felt relaxed
this guy is totally in charge
kersek deals with these types for a living
he looked like he was going to enjoy
yes
yeah its me
after you left i had this conversation
with a co at statesboro prison
seems our man cady had
a job in the kitchen
there was this other inmate
working there with him obstinate sob
he hated cadys cigar smoke
and was always moaning about it
one day they found him
with his neck broke and his tongue bit off
jesus
yeah
they couldnt place cady
at the scene of the accident
if you want to call it that
at least not out loud
but the parole board kept him in
for another seven years
the subject is on the move
get a good nights sleep
who was that
our private eye
i thought we were relaxed now
new essex county hospital
yes room 5036 please
one minute please
all right
hello
hi lori its me
i just feel godawful
you got dragged into this thing
its not your fault
if i had any idea that cady would hurt you
to get at me i would have warned you
yeah i know im glad you called
yeah well
im so sorry about this
i feel the same way
are you really determined
about moving back to connecticut
ive thought about it a lot
i just think its probably the best thing
i thought that maybe
i could go back to school
im really going to miss you
right excuse me
that sounds real good
yeah
thatll work out fine ill get back to you
all right bye
well i just dont know what i hate more
that insipid tone
or your stupid sophomoric infidelities
who was that
the girl that got beat up
yes it was
i already told you
shes a clerk at the county courthouse
and what youre fucking her
interesting choice sam
calling from our bedroom phone
why is it that whenever i have
a private phone conversation
you assume that im fucking someone
thats why that psychopath
chose her right
yes thats why he chose her
but im not fucking her in any way
well you sleazy son of a bitch
stop it
dani is right downstairs
honey theres nothing the matter
yeah i can see dad
i thought you promised
to leave all that shit behind in atlanta
the humiliation we went through
confessing our dirty little secrets
in those sessions with dr hackett
we talked that one incident to death
why did you bother
because you asked me to go
i mean why did you bother
why did you bother with you and me
with the marriage
uprooting me and dani moving
because thats what we decided to do
you said you wanted to get out
what is it i dont get
you dont get it
nadine
its dani
nothing
im just losing my mind here
you know had the balls to walk out
if thats what you wanted
like i was going to split
with you acting the way you act
acting you did some acting
i dont remember acting
you dont remember
let me refresh your memory
remember not working for three months
not fixing any meals
im not on fucking trial here
do you remember crying every morning
afternoon evening remember that
i scared you huh
what did you think sam
you thought maybe
i was going to kill myself
over you
who else
you pompous ass
you wouldnt leave the bedroom
i wish you could say the same
this what dr hackett talked about
digging up the past
the relevant issue is whether
ive been messing around in new essex
and i have not been
as far as this girl goes shes just a kid
that shouldnt stop you
shes a baby you gravitate
to people in the same profession as you
you gravitate to women
come on im a lawyer shes a clerk
she looks up to me
shes just infatuated i cant help that
look leigh im scared
this whole thing has
i keep feeling that there
is some animal out there stalking us
i think he wants to hurt us
in the worst way
and thats got me frightened to death
you really are scared arent you
yeah
somebody finally got to you
look i think
he beat and raped her because he knew
that she wouldnt testify
that she wouldnt press charges
because she knows the system
i mean she works in it
she knows that shed be on trial
then because she wouldnt testify
you would assume that
there was something
going on between us
and it would cause a rift
that wed be much more vulnerable to him
im glad we talked about this
because we can work together
we can beat that son of a bitch
the two of us working as a team
jesus christ
yeah this is great this is something else
oh shit
here you go
im sorry i havent ordered yet
that fellow over there
sent this over paid for and all
who

that guy who is just leaving
excuse me
cady come here

i dont mean this town
i mean the whole state
i dont want to see you or hear you
and i dont want to smell you leave
are you my friend
no im not your friend
i thought maybe you were because i like to
plan my comings and goings with friends
but if youre not my friend
id call that presumptuous
in fact id call it downright rude
because i aint your porchbaby buddy
gee golly gosh im sorry i offended you
you white trash piece of shit
i got the allover fidgets on that one
youve really shaken me up
im shivering all over
its not necessary to lay
a foul tongue on me my friend
i could get upset
things could get out of hand
then in selfdefense
i could do something to you
that you would not like right here
anytime you feel squirrelly you just jump
you threatening me
you catch on fast
im well within my rights
to be here and you know it
lf i stay here what you going to do
i dont give a rats ass about your rights
watch your step
you know what im talking about
you going to arrest me
you a cop or were you a cop
were you not good enough
to remain on the force
thats the feeling im getting here
hope you enjoyed your breakfast
maam this belong to you
can i help you
i just found it
thought you might need it back
not to frighten you but if a dogcatcher
comes across a dog without a license
hes liable to think hes a stray
and do god knows what to it

our dog is
he passed away

making fun of your sexuality

privilege of the profession
eases inhibitions

and youre let me guess
cecile james
no im danielle bowden
danielle oh we spoke last night
yeah
oh im sorry how rude
its okay
i think were alone now
okay
thanks here
im going to give this to you
little trick i learned take it
you know when we spoke
on the phone last night
you really made sense to me
i thought a lot
those are human truths
thats what its all about
and thats what we deal with here
see the book you have thomas wolfe
its all about selfdiscovery
the inner voyage
i like the end
where eugenes journey was really
mystical you know
it was almost like a pilgrimage
almost like a copout if you ask me
though those were the facts of wolfes life
the novel is what you would call
a roman à clef
you know what that is
sure
well nonetheless you cant escape
your demons just by leaving home
although writers do find new freedom
when they relocate abroad
take henry miller
have you read his trilogy
plexus nexus and sexus
you havent read that
no
youre missing something
you know what
i did read tropic of cancer
just parts of it though
because i had to sneak it off
my parents shelf you know
his descriptions are pretty vivid
i would say
in one of the novels i dont recall which
he describes an erection
as a piece of lead with wings on it
i didnt read that part
of course not youre not allowed
your parents dont want you
to achieve adulthood
they know the pitfalls of adulthood
all that freedom
they know it only too well
temptation to stray
deflecting their guilt and anger onto you
for a crime thats not even a crime
for smoking grass
wait a second
where are you from
where am i from
yeah
where do you think im from
i dont know but
if i told you you going to get mad at me
im from the black forest
thats funny
youre not the drama teacher are you
maybe im the big bad wolf
so youre that guy thats been
hanging around the house
youre the one that killed my moms dog
your moms dog was killed
yeah
i didnt even know anything about that
thats a shame
thats a damn shame
yes it was
what kind of dog was it
i dont know he was just
he was fluffy and
fluffy
so you didnt do that
of course i didnt do that
okay
i wouldnt do that
so why what are you doing here then
well i came to meet you
to be honest with you
why i mean
because
i wanted to meet you
see what youre like
i see youre a nice person thats all
youre not going to hurt me are you
im not going to hurt you at all
theres no hurting here danielle
between us theres no anger nothing
just a search for truth
did you judge me get angry at me
when you caught me smoking the grass
no
but your parents judged you
got plenty angry at you didnt they
yeah
they punished you for their sins
what did they do
my dad
they just yelled a whole lot and
my mom cried
and my dad said
i couldnt drive the cherokee
id say they punished you
for their sins and you resent that
and you should resent it
but professor doright has
a little advice for you
you shouldnt damn them
dont judge them
just forgive them
for they know not what they do
why do you hate my father
i dont hate him at all
oh no i pray for him
im here to help him
we all make mistakes danielle
you and i have at least we try to admit it
dont we
yeah
but your daddy he dont
every man carries a circle of hell
around his head like a halo
your daddy too every man
has to go through hell
to reach his paradise
you know what paradise is
no
salvation
cause your daddys not happy
your mommys not happy
and you know what youre not happy
are you
no im not
you thought about me last night
didnt you
yes i did
i know
you know i think
i might have found a companion
for that long walk to the light
do you mind if i put my arm around you
its okay
no i dont mind
okay
kersek where the hell have you been
he came at my daughter at school
you asked me to watch him nights
im watching nights what happened
my wife leigh found some marijuana
in one of danis schoolbooks
we dont know if cady
gave it to her or what happened
shes scared and she wont talk about it
but this has gone far enough
its got to stop
you phone the cops
no i didnt phone the cops
what did you call them
slow skeptical pathetic even
no leigh thats all right
just hold on a minute
kersek
i want to hire those three guys
you remember the hospital job
consider it done the sooner the better
three men are going to cost you a grand
its not chicken feed
but you dont go with less than three
its better to overdo it
youll have the money in the morning
well be on for tomorrow night
and sam
youll feel good about this
all right
do you notice these young people
they dont look very happy
theyre committed to their professions
and ambitions but not to each other
cady shut up and listen
if you dont leave
my family alone
and you dont get out of here
youre going to be hurting
like you never dreamed
could you repeat that
i said
if you dont get out of here
youre going to be hurting
like you never dreamed
a threat
yeah
you bet your ass thats a threat
i have thought of relocating
where id be more appreciated
california perhaps
i could teach earthquake preparedness
but then it hits me
i love new essex counselor
i mean where else could i just
casually confer with an old colleague
were not colleagues
do you understand that
you think youre better than me
no i dont
thats not the goddamned point
good if youre not better than me
then i can have what you have
what do i have
a wife a daughter
im going to teach you
the meaning of commitment
fourteen years ago i was forced to make
a commitment to an eightbynine cell
and now youre going to be forced
to make a commitment
you could say im here to save you
fine
check out the bible counselor
the book between esther and psalms
you all right
is everything all right
yeah
this isnt going to work you know
what isnt going to work
locking us in hiding us from the world
oh dont be so dramatic dani
making me stay out of school
youre going back to school tomorrow
and put some clothes on
youre not a kid anymore
why am i going back to school tomorrow
what are you going to do
thats none of your concern dani
dad
he didnt force himself on me you know
i know youd like to think that he did
but i think he was
i think he was just trying
to make a connection with me
you know
now dani
i want you to listen to me
no do you understand
there will never be any connection
between you
and max cady
you understand that
did he touch you
what are you laughing about
why are you smiling
im asking you a question
did he touch you
dani wipe that smile off your face
im asking you did he touch you
oh wait dani im sorry
wait honey im sorry
get out of here
come on
counselor
is that you
come out come out wherever you are
i aint no white trash piece of shit
im better than you all
i can outlearn you
i can outread you
i can outthink you
and i can outphilosophize you
and im going to outlast you
you think a couple whacks to my
goodoldboy gut will get me down
its going to take a hell of a lot
more than that
to prove youre better than me
i am like god and god like me
i am as large as god
he is as small as i
he cannot above me
nor i beneath him be
silesius 17th century
could you be there
i wonder if youre here
ah fuck it
if youre here
what the fuck is the difference
fuck it
ive got mr kersek on one
good ill take it
sam you look tired you get that writ
no we have to get into that
let me just grab this
kersek
im damn sorry about last night
that son of a bitch could survive
a nuclear strike
hang on a second
tom im not doing it i pulled a fast one
and its come back and bit me on the ass
what you did was dumb what im asking
is no big deal this is my daughter
no its perjury
its bullshit and im not doing it
all right
ill be in my office
who was that top criminal lawyer
lee heller we need to talk
if word gets out how cady
bushwhacked those bastards
itll be hard to get three new guys
i dont want three new guys
you hear me
mr heller its sam bowden
from broadbent and denmeyer
tom speaks very highly of you he says
youre the best and thats what i need
we froze our butts together in korea
how can i help you sam
its a petition for a restraining order
but there have been complications
i know this is short notice
but i need this injunction
theres an exconvict named max cady
whos been harassing my family
im sorry mr bowden
i cant continue this conversation
is there a more convenient time
the damn thing is i have a conflict
what would that be
you see
mr cady retained my services yesterday
he what
in fact i see on my phone sheet
mr cady called this morning
so im sure hell fill me in
but wait a minute lee
this man is a psychotic
it appears ill be seeing you
at that hearing after all
could you repeat that
i said if you dont leave
my family alone
and if you dont get out of here
youre gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed
a threat
you bet your ass thats a threat
you need only glance
at my client to know
that mr bowden made good
on his heinous and cowardly threat
just as god arose to judgment
to save all the meek of the earth
i hope and pray you will do the same sir
your honor
mr cady wouldnt have
surreptitiously taped our meeting
unless he knew that hed
this court does not condone
feuds vendettas or vigilantism
let me quote our great negro educator
mr booker t washington
i will let no man drag me down so low
as to make me hate him
yes
i will grant the restraining order
not to validate the malice between you
but in the interest of christian harmony
you may not come within 500 yards
of mr maximilian cady
until such time as the court
may lift the injunction
king solomon could not have
adjudicated more wisely your honor
i am so offended by the philistine tactics
of mr bowden
i petitioned the aba
for his disbarment
on the grounds of moral turpitude
now if you will excuse us my client
is due back at the hospital
for the results of his numerous xrays
kersek i want a gun
i need a gun i want a gun
you want a gun
yeah i need a gun
know anything about guns
i dont believe in them not in the house
ill get you a gun what kind
now calm down
something simple i can handle
let me see what fits you
fortyfive
let me see your hands
a 38 snubnosed special
all right good
i can teach you how to use it
great
the first lesson is this
dont think of it as trying to kill a man
right
its an extension of your fist
youre just reaching out
and knocking him down
boom all right
later on well shoot some trees okay
thatd be great good
what is it what
well sam
yeah
i give you a gun you pull it on cady
it will dawn on you that shooting
a man is different than shooting a tree
next thing you know cady has the gun
youll teach me i could handle a gun
he wont take it away
bestcase scenario
you kill cady dogdead
fifteen years to life
do you realize that counselor
oh jesus its all fucked up kersek
i mean the law considers me
more of a loose cannon than max cady
some bigshit attorney has whipped the
abas ethics committee into a frenzy
theres an emergency session
in raleigh over the assault
how did they link that to you
i went to warn cady
i thought it was the decent thing to do
maybe id scare him he was wired
goddamn fools
this hearing its real important
only if i want to continue to practice law
cady isnt expected there is he
mr cady hes beyond reproach
but youre required to be there
yeah
when is this hearing
its thursday morning 900
the torture begins and lasts for two days
you have to fly up the night before
right
cadys an opportunist
if he thinks youre gone for two days
thats going to be as tempting to him
as shit is to a fly
if cady breaks into your home
he can be killed
justifiably
but he wont show unless
hes sure you wont be there
have a good trip
all right byebye
call us tonight okay
all right
i didnt miss the 920 to raleigh
im afraid you did theres a 1020
its not that i have some
important papers for samuel bowden
was he on the 920
we cant give out that information sir
well its just
i guess i could send it to him overnight
but he might be back for all i know
tomorrow morning and i
see i
my wife and i have been in an accident
and hes our lawyer
if i dont get in touch with him
we could lose this case
weve already lost our little daughter dani
is
is there any way to know if he was
on that flight and when hes returning
itd really help us
hell be back the day after tomorrow sir
bless your heart
go on in
get down sam
give me a cigarette
slow down youre outpacing me
twotoone since you started again
just keep track of how many i owe you
howd it go at the airport
we did our thing
but we dont know if he saw us
or if he was there
set the trap and well see
what if we dont want to see
dani
what
maybe he poisoned the dog
sam watch out for the windows
youre not allowed to stand up remember
didnt cady go after her
you dont know dani
if she finds a palmetto bug in her bedroom
she takes it outside
you know she could never kill anything
even a sixfoot palmetto bug
oh god
what is that
its monofilament line
i got it from sams fishing gear
i stretch it across the windows
and the doors
and tie it to danis teddy bear here
if the bear moves a quarter of an inch
i know if the holy ghost is sneaking in
what are you reading
why did kersek quit
no
its just that cady said
you want some answers
me too
id like to know just how strong we are
or how weak
but i guess the only way
were going to find that out is by
going through this
its just that cady said to read the book
between esther and psalms
which is which one
the book of job
job was a good man he believed in god
and god tested his faith
he took away everything he had
even his children
its hideous this plan i mean barbaric
theyre crazy
my dads turned into some kind of
i dont know what
barbaric
listen to your father
do what they say what else can you do
leave we could go to the houseboat
you know and get lost in any inlet
dani come on
dont stay outside
do you want to know
what really disturbs me
killing this guy
i mean taking a mans life
i dont know if i can live with that
you may have to
sam just remember the plan
i know the plan
damn its premeditated
it makes me an accomplice
an accessory an abettor
its also excessive force
the only thing excessive
we could do to cady
would be to gut him and eat his liver
that might be excessive
jesus christ kersek im serious
no youre scared
but thats okay
i want you to savor that fear
you know the south evolved in fear
fear of the indian fear of the slave
fear of the damn union
the south has a fine tradition
of savoring fear
whats the matter
dont look over
shes making me nervous
what would she normally do
if sam wasnt around to run her home
shed stay
shed stay over
well then she stays over
what
leigh
i know how the dog died
sam are you dreaming
no
i just had the weirdest feeling
he was already in the house
cant sleep miss graciela
yeah its hot
you know i think its the humidity
that makes us all so thirsty
excuse me
my pop was a cop
twenty years
this was his favorite drink on a stakeout
i learned that in prison you like
white trash piece of shit
stay here leigh
kersek
dani go back to your room
lock the door
dont go down there sam
no its all right
dani dont look
oh my god graciela
oh my god
its the piano wire
im going to get this son of a bitch
tell him to stop
god he might be out here
listen ive got kerseks gun with me
and youll find the piano wire
that cady used in the house
yeah i know how this looks
youre not supposed to flee
a murder scene
listen lieutenant
you may not know this
but in the law theres something
called force majeure
it means an unforeseeable act of god
and it cancels all promises
and obligations
so legally speaking all bets are off
you find max cady and well come back
what did he say
he said were fugitives
whats that mean
it means were doing something right
wheres that old mongrel dog of yours
mrs bowden
tomorrow ill catch some fish
oh you know you dont have to
ive got enough food to last us a week

danielle i told you you cant escape
your demons just by leaving home

shame
i had hoped we could
read aloud from it together
well i
memorized some for you
did you
yeah
did you
well im impressed
which part
the part
you know what part you know
i dont think you did your homework
i did
what parts were they
the good parts
yeah they were
were you a good girl
i was
i knew youd follow me here and
you know me pretty well dont you
yeah i do
youre going to know me a lot better too
are you offering me something hot
lets get something straight here
i spent fourteen years
in an eightbynine cell
surrounded by people
who were less than human
my mission in that time was
to become more than human
you see
granddaddy used to handle
snakes in church
granny drank strychnine
you could say i had a legup
genetically speaking
im going to forgive you danielle honey
i know that wasnt the real you
the true you
but i would like you to wait in the hold
danielle get in the hold
stop
no
ready to be born again mrs bowden
a few minutes alone with me darling
and youll be speaking in tongues
excuse me mrs b
please dont take umbrage
but in the plan that i have formulated
theres much more to it
than just you and i making love
i mean thats just so
commonplace and dreary
here and now we have an opportunity
what is that opportunity you ask
why here and now
we have an opportunity
to depict and dramatize
both the heights and the depths
of a mamas true love of her daughter
if you get my meaning
come on out babe
come on darling lets go
get out get up here
this is between you and me
leave them out of it
this is my night counselor
dont you step on my lines
stop
yes leigh
listen to me max
you know max since all this started
ive thought about you all the time
ive tried to imagine
what it must have been like for you
all those years locked up in jail
ive tried to imagine you
and even your crimes
and how you must have felt
in those moments that you did them
see i know about loss max
i know about losing time
even losing years
and i know it doesnt compare to jail but
i can understand
and i could share this with you
because of that whatever it is
that youve got planned
i want you to do it just with me
not with her
because
we have this connection
what do you think counselor
that was real eloquent leigh
brave too
i want to thank you for conveying to me
your most powerful emotions
because
im going to enjoy this all the more
oh my god
the people call samuel j bowden
do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth
somebodys got to man the boat
did you swear
ill do it
sit danielle
dont make light of your civic duty
youre the jury
all right i swear to tell the truth
what do you want to know
was a prior sexual history ever prepared
in connection with my defense
its
im sorry your honor
that was argumentative
an investigator did prepare a prior
sexual history on the alleged victim
true
i can ask leading questions your honor
he is a hostile witness
would you care to tell the court
what the gist was of this report
it was fourteen years ago
i cant remember that
how can he answer
when youre hitting him
because hes perjuring himself
he knows damn well what it said
dont you
it said that she was promiscuous
it said she had three different lovers
in one month
at least three and did you show
this report to the da
i found it when i started representing
myself six years into my sentence
but there it was in the court file
back in 77 you buried it counselor
would you care to tell the jury why
would you care to tell the court why
because i know he brutally raped her
and he beat her
talk to me im standing here
just because she was promiscuous
doesnt justify you raping her
you bragged that you beat two prior
aggravated rapes you were a menace
you were my lawyer
that report could have saved me
fourteen years
youre probably right
you selfrighteous fuck
im virgil and im guiding you
through the gates of hell
we are now in the 9th circle
the circle of traitors
traitors to country
traitors to fellow man
traitors to god
you sir are charged with
betraying the principles of all three
can you please quote for me the abas
rules of professional conduct canon 7
a lawyer should represent his client
should zealously represent his client
within the bounds of the law
and i find you guilty counselor
guilty of betraying your fellow man
guilty of betraying your country
guilty of abrogating your oath
guilty of judging me and selling me out
and with the power vested in me
by the kingdom of god
i sentence you to the 9th circle of hell
now you will learn about loss
loss of freedom loss of humanity
now you and i will truly
be the same counselor
danielle get down on your knees
take off your clothes
down on your knees now
take off your clothes
get down on your knees
dont
now off with your clothes
you leigh take off your clothes now
come on
tonight youll learn to be an animal
to live like an animal and to die like one
give me your hand
go
did you forget about that
restraining order counselor
youre well within 500 yards
well here we are counselor
just two lawyers
working it out
im going to kill you
you already sacrificed me counselor
on jordans stormy banks i stand
oh who will come and go with me
i am bound for the promised land
we never spoke about what happened
at least not to each other
fear i suppose
that to remember his name
or what he did
would mean letting him into our dreams
and me i hardly dream
about him anymore
still things wont ever be
the way they were before he came
but thats all right
