that for such a lovely river   
   the name was mystifying 
cape fear 
when the only thing to fear
on those enchanted summer nights   
   was that the magic would end
and real life would come crashing in 
okay  cady  the moment
you ve been waiting for 
any people coming for you  cady 
 what about your books 
 already read them 
hi  how are you 
  cómo estás 
 bien 
this ropa limpia 
no  that means  clean   these are dirty 
the idea is to resolve the tension 
i need to find a motif
that s about movement 
not the most mind blowing concept
for a travel agency   
   but what the hey 
 like an arrow  maybe 
 yeah  like an arrow 
maybe 
but  see  then the other aspect
is stability   
   a company that you can trust 
so if you can balance those ideas   
   in a way that s pleasing to the eye
then you got a logo 
okay  movement  stability   
   and an arrow 
okay  i ll think of something for that one 
benjamin  yes 
they switched babies on me
at the hospital  didn t they

my wife doesn t even know you exist 
which  most certainly  is for the best 
why s that 
god  lori  you know why you ask
that question

   get married and live together
for a long time   
i like hanging out with you  so sue me 
you re funny  and you re cute

in my sentence 
 atlanta   77 
 you got it  july 
fourteen years since i held a set of keys 
well  you look good  healthy 
thank you  it s a struggle
to stay healthy in the joint 
but you wouldn t know about that 
would you 
they would stick you with
the white trash  they don t work all day 
in fact   
   this little old cigar is my only vice   
    cause i needed a vice in the joint
to remind me i was human 
what brings you to new essex 
oh  the climate 
boy  the south 
i m thinking of settling down here
in new essex  counsellor 
have you been following me 
it s a small town 
we re gonna run into each other 
 well  take care  mr  cady 
 you  too 
 you re gonna learn about loss 
 what 
dad  could you   
i m sorry  dani 
 what re you working on 
 it s english 
we re supposed to read
look homeward  angel   
   which is a kind of reminiscence   
   and we have to attempt something
in the same style 
what s it about  your reminiscence 
the houseboat 
it s not even july 3 yet 
we ought to take two weeks
and go to wilmington   
   like the old times  dock the houseboat 
i wanted to in early june 
you said you didn t have time 
 i probably don t 
 yeah  now i don t  either 
besides  dani s got summer school
till labor day 
is it really that critical
that she can t miss two damn weeks 
you know 
the alternative was to expel her 
maybe this drama teacher from the college
will get her excited about something 
yeah  about him  probably 
why d they have to make such a stink 
like she was on heroin  or something 
i mean  what s marijuana 
you and i smoked a little dope in our time 
in some cultures 
it s considered almost a sacrament 
i realize in ours it s forbidden 
right up there with incest
and necrophilia and bestiality 
honey 
 worship of idols  cannibalism 
 do that again 
 what 
 do that again 
 sam  somebody s out there 
 what 
leave the light off  leave it off 
i saw him when the fireworks went off 
what 
 i think i talked to him this afternoon 
 you know him 
i want you the hell off my property 
he s gone 
he said 
 i m gonna make you think about loss  
or   i m gonna make you learn about loss  
something like that 
that s very poetic 
 who is he  where did he come from 
 he s from   
come on  leigh  get the dog off 
ben  get down 
he doesn t mind me at all 
it s your dog  come on 
no  he shouldn t be up on the table 
 you ll have dog hairs in the tea 
 get down 
where s he from 
he s from the hills  pentecostal crackers 
what was he in prison for 
 i think it was battery 
 you think it was battery 
 who did he batter  a man  a woman 
 i don t know 
it was fourteen years ago 
you know  it s kind of   
i really don t remember 
what does he want with you 
he s just trying to bug us 
just messing around 
he s an ex con  so he s just   
you know  he s probably upset
at the lawyer 
 yeah  your clientele 
 yeah 
  bye  dad 
  bye  dani 
 you look tired 
 thanks  i needed that 
i d rather dani didn t wander out alone   
   on her walks in the woods   
   till i ve started a few things 
maybe even talk to the boss 
 what if she takes benjamin with her 
 big ben  our guard dog 
what s he gonna do  lick him to death 
 just tell her 
 what  i hardly know anything about him 
i don t mean his biography 
just there s some creep around 
if you see him again 
call the cops and then call me 
what about a weapon 
in case things get exciting around here 
would you feel more secure
with a loaded gun in the house 
we d end up using it on each other 
or dani would  he won t do anything 
he just got out of prison 
he doesn t want to go right back 
call lee heller 
lee is a colorful character but he s still
the best criminal lawyer in the state 
 good 
 get me lee heller 
 sam  you defended this guy  right 
 right 
what makes you think
he wants to harm you 
yesterday i was getting in my car 
the guy comes up 
we have a conversation 
he says to me 
 you re gonna learn about loss  
that d hardly qualify
under the terrorist threat statutes 
tom  for christ s sake  the guy s an ex con 
you know as well as i do what that means 
last night  there he was  behind our house 
 attempted b and e 
 no  not exactly 
he was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property 
that s not even trespassing  sam 
come on  what can i say 
get a restraining order 
i filed one this morning 
the hearing s in ten days 
good  anything i can do 
tom  fourteen years ago   
   in this case i had a report on the victim 
 it was a rape case 
 that s right 
rape and aggravated sexual battery 
anyway  i had a report on this victim   
   and it came back
that she was promiscuous 
and   
   i buried it 
 anybody else know about this 
 no  i buried it 
i didn t show it to the client
or the prosecution 
but if you had seen
what this guy had done to this girl   
 in every criminal prosecution 
the accused shall have   
    the assistance of counsel
for his defense  
i know the sixth amendment 
i believe in it 
that s why i left
the public defender s office 
there was no way to serve the law
in that capacity 
some folks don t have the right
to the best defense 
of course they deserve the best defense 
but if you had seen what he did
to this girl   
 buried the report 
 lf it was your own daughter 
 yeah  i mean   
 buried the report 
jesus  sam 
oh  god 
but i don t see how he could know that 
he was illiterate 
i had to read everything to him 
the probable cause affidavit   
   the arrest reports  everything 
there s no way he could know that 
hey  dani   
   it s so quiet out here 
and the light s so perfect   
   why don t you get your book
and come out here and read 
why 
i told you why 
is it because he s like a flasher
or just a peeper 
what do you know about that  a flasher 
you don t think i ve been flashed before 
i didn t mean to insult you 
i m sure you ve been flashed 
if you want to come out  come on out 
if you don t  go on 
do whatever you want 
but don t go outside 
 afternoon  counselor 
what do you want  mr  cady 
they re great at that age  ain t they 
all those discoveries ahead of them 
you re lucky 
my own daughter 
she don t even know me 
after i went inside 
her mama told her i was dead   
   which  in a way  i was 
mr  cady  i realize that you suffered 
i understand your problem 
but  i mean  why me 
i was your lawyer  i defended you 
why not badger the d a  or the judge 
  badger  
 why not them 
best i remember 
they was just doing right by their jobs 
i didn t do my job  is that right 
i pleaded you out
to a lesser occluded offense 
you could ve gotten rape
instead of battery 
i d have been up for parole in seven years
according to georgia penal code 
rape is a capital offense 
you could ve gotten life  death 
you could be sitting
on death row right now 
i learned to read during my stretch 
first  spot goes to the farm   
   then runaway bunny 
then law books  mostly 
did you know  after i discharged you 
i acted as my own attorney 
applied several times for an appeal 
no  i didn t know that 
so  here we are   
   two lawyers  for all practical purposes 
talking shop 
how much do you want  mr  cady 
 how much do i want what 
 how much money do you want 
money 
counselor  do i look destitute to you 
i m open to discussion 
within reasonable limits 
you ever been a woman 
 a what 
 a woman 
some fat  hairy  ugly hillbilly s wet dream 
i realize that you suffered 
there s no question about that 
you don t know
what suffering is  counselor 
like it says in galatians 3 
 have ye suffered so many things in vain  
i learned from the get go in the joint
to get in touch with my feminine side 
i m open to some sort of discussion
on compensation 
what shall be my compensation  sir   
   for being held down and sodomized
by four white guys   
   or four black guys 
shall my compensation be the same 
what is the formula for compensation  sir 
how about  10 000 in cash 
do i   
let s just break that down 
that figure just came
to the top of my head 
for argument s sake 
let s say  20 000   30 000 
i ll tell you what  let s say  50 000 
 50 000 into fourteen years 
fourteen years times 365 days   
   is about 5 000 days 
you divide that by  50 000 
and that s like  10 a day 
that s not even minimum wage 
to say nothing about the family
and respect that i lost 
i don t think you really understand
what we re talking about 
fourteen years 
whoops 
gotta git 
i m late for another appointment 
i got some good news 
i got the bank  the account number 
i ll call your son in law s lawyer 
tell him we re going to court 
mr  bowden  your wife s on line one 
ask her to hold  i have to make a call 
 i wouldn t make that call  the way i d   
 mr  bowden   
   she says it s urgent 
yeah 
   these kind of horrible 
high pitched howls 
they sounded like he was screaming   
   and then dani came running in  and i   
   i called the vet 
then it was so weird because   
   it was like he was winding down   
   just winding down like an old clock 
then  all of a sudden  he just stopped 
he had this kind of   
   his eyes just wide open 
and this kind of   
   surprised look 
and then   
   then he died 
he just died  before the vet even got here 
what did the vet say 
 that he was poisoned 
 poisoned 
what kind of poison 
 i don t know what kind of poison 
 jesus  i told you not to let him out 
 i didn t let him out 
 then how 
stop 
i ve got an english setter myself 
so i don t cotton to dog killers 
trouble is  poisoning a dog is just a fine 
but if he s unemployed 
he has to have money   
   or we ll bust him for vagrancy 
we ll give him a full body strip search 
jerk a knot in his tail 
all right 
they got so many ways on the books
to lean on an undesirable 
he ll feel about as welcome
around here as a case of yellow fever 
 hands against the wall 
 spread them 
 that him 
 face the wall 
one way mirror  mr  bowden 
he doesn t know you re here 
yeah  that s him 
get the shirt off 
 come on  hurry up 
 just pass it over to him 
 hand it to me 
 knock off the shoes 
hand them to the other officer 
pass them to him  come on 
put the arms out 
put your arms out straight 
roll your palms 
do what he says 
turn around  slow 
i don t know whether
to look at him or read him 
stand still 
one more step for you 
you know the routine 
against the wall 
we searched his apartment 
car registration and everything s in order 
there s no guns or any other weapons 
but we found these 
cady s savings account 
 30 000 
yeah  his mother died
while he was serving 
the farm got sold off 
he got the proceeds 
he s got money 
where does that leave us 
at the very least  we nail him
for the dog  what happened 
you let the dog out  cady abducted him 
we didn t let the dog out 
cady came into your house 
that s illegal entry with intent 
but he didn t come in the house 
i m not a cop 
i don t know exactly how he did it 
i just know that he did it somehow 
that s not good enough  mr  bowden 
you re a lawyer 
you damn well know that 
get off the pants 
sooner or later  he s gonna screw up 
the sheriff assured me
that they always do  he s an ex con 
he s going to get the message
in no uncertain terms 
i d still like to kill him 
how come you didn t join up with them 
you can tap 
you can tap dance 
i wanted to once  but i don t know   
 son of a bitch 
 what 
 he s staring at you 
 what are you talking about 
what the hell are you doing 
hot as a firecracker on the 4th of july 
 you re damn lucky to have her  boy 
 you son of a bitch 
where did he go 
watch my arm  it might be broke 
what s with you  you have no right
to be pushing me around like that 
i was just watching the parade 
i wasn t pranking on nobody 
what are you getting so upset about 
you re lucky i don t sue you 
all right 
 settle down 
 i am settled down 
 what are you doing 
 it s nothing 
 who was that 
 it s no one  come on 
the fellow with the tie 
his wife took him away 
 i think he really hurt his arm 
 mom 
 strong drink you got there  mister 
 you said it 
just put a little goldfish in it 
and you ll be fine 
you seem to be having a good time 
 i ve been practicing 
 practicing for what 
 how to fall on the floor 
 a life of debauchery 
debauch  what 
debauchery  it s a three syllable word 
making fun of me 
that s okay  no problem 
 i made you blush 
 blush 
yes  you re now the color
of your shirt  scarlet 
i had no business getting
stuck on a guy who was married 
 you certainly did not 
 i don t know what i was thinking 
god only knows 
aren t i the bozo on this bus 
oh  god  lest you think that i slept
with this particular married guy   
that s your business  not mine 
i don t want to make it sound like
i ve been through a busload of them 
that s the way it sounded to me 
 he was the first 
 oh  yeah 
 he was  i swear 
 oh  yeah 
 oh  boy 
 tell it to the judge 
 actually the rat stood me up today 
 did he 
 yes 
 what a shame 
i know 
so  now it s my turn  where are you from 
where am i from 
 you re gonna love this 
 yes 
i m from the georgia state
correctional facility 
you think i m joking  that s the truth 
i just got released from prison 
my god  this is the way
my day has been turning out 
actually  it reminds me of a joke 
 do you want to hear it 
 tell me  liven up the night 
an unmarried woman   
wait a minute  that s not it 
 come on  get the joke straight 
 shut up  let me do it 
an unmarried woman meets a guy   
   and he tells her he just got out of prison 
 what did you do   she asks 
 i hacked my wife into 52 pieces
with a chain saw  
she says   so  you re single  
 that s even funnier 
 thank you 
 could i ask you something 
 what 
 what did you do 
 i knew you were going to ask 
 i hacked my wife into 52 pieces 
 i was afraid you d say that 
i m a very small person  so maybe   
maybe i can hack you into 40 pieces 
 what did you do  really 
 no  really  but what did you do 
there was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant and   
   when they came to arrest us   
   this macho sheriff got rough
with the lady behind me 
i popped the bastard 
so they gave me a little time for it 
i m drinking a sea breeze 
i hope you can afford them 
you have to stay sober  if you ain t
sober  you re taking your chances 
because i m just one hell of an animal 
yeah  do tell 
get you on this side  doll  let s do this 
who is loretta anyway 
that s the love of my life 
she s no longer with us 
 i thought i was the love of your life 
 chopped her into 52 pieces 
he hurt you like this  that married guy 
 he hurt you like this 
 i told you  we never did anything 
 he hurt you like this 
 oh  scandal 
he s a rough one 
how s this feel 
oh  my god  am i under arrest 
not quite  darlin  
officer  i swear  it s all a mistake 
that married guy hurt you like this 
because what he did to me
hurt a lot worse than this 
i ve got you now  bitch 
dani  when did this key stop working 
what  oh  i don t know 
no wonder  a wire s missing 
a piano wire is missing  was somebody
fooling around with the piano 
what 
 yeah 
 mr  bowden 
 i think we might have a little break 
 good 
i can be there in a half hour 
all right  fine  thank you 
 who was that 
 cady raped another girl 
rape  you said it was battery 
the case was wobbly  i got it reduced 
i remember those days  old slippery sam 
i m sorry 
i just didn t want to alarm you or dani 
 why  how old was that girl 
 16 
16  what 
my birthday is coming up 
neighbors heard screams and called us 
when the perp drove off 
somebody made his plate 
 max cady 
 great 
we got one little problem 
the girl is scared 
she s claiming she fell down some stairs 
don t look at me 
oh  my god 
you two know each other 
yeah  we work together 
i ll be outside 
i m so stupid 
you stood me up at the club the other day 
then you didn t call 
by last night   
   i was feeling pretty reckless 
i thought about what you said  you know   
   that your wife didn t know i existed 
and i felt like   
   i was going to show you 
i guess i showed you  all right  didn t i 
i guess i really showed you 
listen to me  okay 
now  look  this guy cady   
   he s done this kind of thing before 
now  he s going to do this
over and over again   
   unless you testify
and we take him to court   
no 
and press charges and testify 
i know how it works  i see it every day 
only this time  i m on the other side 
i don t want to explain why i was in a bar   
   and how much i had to drink
and what i was wearing 
not by the people i work with 
not by the guys that i see
cross examine other people on the stand 
just crucify them 
they just laugh about it later 
they ll even ask about you 
listen to me  i don t care about that 
well  i care about that 
i m sure you do  too 
i m terribly sorry  i m just terribly sorry 
if this is something personal
between you  the girl and cady   
personal 
all right  come on  lieutenant 
what are you implying 
only that there are some things
that are better handled quietly 
not by the police 
this cady is planning to rape my wife 
but it s not your problem 
i can t bust someone for planning a rape 
you re a lawyer 
you know that damn well 
 thanks 
 the way i d handle it   
what  file a restraining order 
i already did 
just think of cady as a tiger 
the trick is to get him out of the brush 
how do we do that 
you stake out a couple of your goats
and hide in a tree 
what are you suggesting 
that i use my family as bait 
and then what 
hope that this psychopath
attacks my wife and child 
 then what  blow his head off 
 i m a law officer 
it would be unethical of me to advise a
citizen to take the law into his own hands 
 i suppose you must ve misunderstood me 
 i guess i must ve 
well  pardon me all over the place 
and he s been harassing my family 
cleverly  so that the law can t touch him 
i believe he s able to slip
in and out of the house undetected 
although  is he out  i can t tell 
he s either out or in  i m not sure 
i can t see through walls 
i m not asking you to see through walls 
that s fine 
why can t anybody do anything for me 
what good are cops and laws   
sam  calm down 
let me explain something to you 
the system is set up to handle
generalized problems   
   like burglary and robbery 
but if some lone creep targets you
for some obscure reason   
   the system is slow and skeptical 
pathetic even 
what s your connection with this fellow 
 i was his lawyer  his public defender 
 but you shafted him somehow  right 
 at least that s the way he perceives it 
 i don t care what you did 
 what did he do 
 he raped a 16 year old girl 
do you have a daughter around 16 
she s 15 
here s the deal 
i ll do a background check 
follow him and write up a risk assessment 
 great  now  the cops   
 i can find him 
 his name s max cady 
 just take it easy  stay calm 
dani  you can just relax because   
   your daddy has a private investigator
on the payroll 
isn t that right 
what s your feeling about him 
what  sam spade 
mickey spillane  peter gunn 
dirty harry  perry mason 
no  perry mason was a lawyer 
the minute i walked in
this guy s office  i felt relaxed 
this guy is totally in charge 
kersek deals with these types for a living 
he looked like he was going to enjoy   
 yes 
 yeah  it s me 
after you left  i had this conversation
with a c o  at statesboro prison 
seems our man cady had
a job in the kitchen 
there was this other inmate
working there with him  obstinate s o b 
he hated cady s cigar smoke
and was always moaning about it 
one day  they found him
with his neck broke and his tongue bit off 
jesus 
yeah 
they couldn t place cady
at the scene of the accident   
   if you want to call it that   
   at least not out loud 
but the parole board kept him in
for another seven years 
the subject is on the move 
get a good night s sleep 
 who was that 
 our private eye 
i thought we were relaxed now 
new essex county hospital 
yes  room 5036  please 
 one minute  please 
 all right 
 hello 
 hi  lori  it s me 
i just feel god awful
you got dragged into this thing 
it s not your fault 
if i had any idea that cady would hurt you
to get at me  i would have warned you 
yeah  i know  i m glad you called 
yeah  well 
 i m so sorry about this 
 i feel the same way 
are you really determined
about moving back to connecticut 
i ve thought about it a lot 
i just think it s probably the best thing 
i thought that maybe
i could go back to school 
i m really going to miss you 
right  excuse me 
 that sounds real good 
 yeah 
 that ll work out fine  i ll get back to you 
 all right   bye 
well  i just don t know what i hate more 
that insipid tone
or your stupid  sophomoric infidelities 
who was that 
 the girl that got beat up 
 yes  it was 
i already told you 
she s a clerk at the county courthouse 
and what  you re fucking her 
interesting choice  sam 
calling from our bedroom phone 
why is it that whenever i have
a private phone conversation   
   you assume that i m fucking someone 
that s why that psychopath
chose her  right 
yes  that s why he chose her 
but i m not fucking her in any way 
well  you sleazy son of a bitch 
stop it 
dani is right downstairs 
 honey  there s nothing the matter 
 yeah  i can see  dad 
i thought you promised
to leave all that shit behind in atlanta 
the humiliation we went through
confessing our dirty little secrets   
   in those sessions with dr  hackett 
 we talked that one incident to death 
 why did you bother 
 because you asked me to go 
 i mean  why did you bother 
why did you bother with you and me 
with the marriage 
uprooting me and dani  moving 
because that s what we decided to do 
you said you wanted to get out 
 what is it i don t get 
 you don t get it 
nadine 
it s dani 
nothing 
i m just losing my mind here 
you know  had the balls to walk out 
if that s what you wanted 
like i was going to split 
with you acting the way you act 
acting  you did some acting 
i don t remember acting 
you don t remember 
let me refresh your memory 
remember not working for three months 
not fixing any meals 
i m not on fucking trial here 
do you remember crying every morning
afternoon  evening  remember that 
i scared you  huh 
what did you think  sam 
you thought maybe
i was going to kill myself 
 over you 
 who else 
you pompous ass 
you wouldn t leave the bedroom 
 i wish you could say the same 
 this what dr  hackett talked about 
digging up the past 
the relevant issue is whether
i ve been messing around in new essex 
and i have not been 
as far as this girl goes  she s just a kid 
that shouldn t stop you 
she s a baby  you gravitate
to people in the same profession as you 
you gravitate to women 
come on  i m a lawyer  she s a clerk 
she looks up to me 
she s just infatuated  i can t help that 
look  leigh  i m scared 
this whole thing has   
i keep feeling that there
is some animal out there stalking us 
i think he wants to hurt us
in the worst way   
   and that s got me frightened to death 
 you really are scared  aren t you 
 yeah 
somebody finally got to you 
look  i think   
   he beat and raped her because he knew
that she wouldn t testify   
   that she wouldn t press charges   
   because she knows the system 
i mean  she works in it 
she knows that she d be on trial 
then  because she wouldn t testify 
you would assume that   
   there was something
going on between us   
   and it would cause a rift 
that we d be much more vulnerable to him 
i m glad we talked about this 
because we can work together 
we can beat that son of a bitch 
the two of us  working as a team 
jesus christ 
yeah  this is great  this is something else 
oh  shit 
 here you go 
 i m sorry  i haven t ordered yet 
that fellow over there
sent this over  paid for and all 
who 
 which one 
 that guy who is just leaving 
excuse me 
cady  come here 
wait up a second 
i ve been in a real bad mood lately 
shame  ain t it 
you know what you can do
to brighten my mood 
 no 
 get the hell out of here 
i don t mean this town 
i mean the whole state 
i don t want to see you or hear you
and i don t want to smell you  leave 
are you my friend 
no  i m not your friend 
i thought maybe you were because i like to
plan my comings and goings with friends 
but if you re not my friend 
i d call that presumptuous 
in fact  i d call it downright rude 
because i ain t your porch baby  buddy 
gee golly gosh  i m sorry i offended you 
you white trash piece of shit 
i got the all over fidgets on that one 
you ve really shaken me up 
i m shivering all over 
it s not necessary to lay
a foul tongue on me  my friend 
i could get upset 
things could get out of hand 
then  in self defense 
i could do something to you   
   that you would not like  right here 
 anytime you feel squirrelly  you just jump 
 you threatening me 
you catch on fast 
i m well within my rights
to be here and you know it 
 lf i stay here  what you going to do 
 i don t give a rat s ass about your rights 
watch your step 
you know what i m talking about 
you going to arrest me 
you a cop  or were you a cop 
were you not good enough
to remain on the force 
that s the feeling i m getting here 
hope you enjoyed your breakfast 
ma am  this belong to you 
 can i help you 
 i just found it 
thought you might need it back 
not to frighten you  but if a dogcatcher
comes across a dog without a license   
   he s liable to think he s a stray
and do god knows what to it 
you know   
   our dog is   
 he passed away 
 what a shame 
man s best friend and all  woman s too 
even without closing my eyes 
i can picture him   
   big  friendly  shaggy 
asleep at your feet   
   keeping you company while you re trying
to finish up those pesky little sketches 
you re max cady  aren t you 
you better get the hell out of here
before i call the police 
i m not doing nothing 
just giving back your dog collar 
i m not on your property 
what d you come out here for 
to look around 
go ahead  mr  cady  take a good look 
nice house 
it is a nice house 
you satisfied now you ve seen it 
or is there more 
is that it 
there is going to be more  isn t there 
you won t stop until you re happy 
how can i be happy
when you re not happy 
you don t know anything about me 
 i know what i see  ma am 
 yeah 
i wanted to know what you looked like 
i ve been waiting to see your face 
but now that i see you   
   you are just repulsive 
 i understand 
 yeah 
i m not your type 
all that prison time made me coarse 
guess i m covered in too many tattoos 
but there s not a whole lot
to do in prison but desecrate your flesh 
it didn t have to be that way
for either of us   
   if your husband hadn t betrayed us both 
who knows 
we might have been different people 
we might have been happy  leigh 
 mom  someone s on the phone 
 dani 
don t come out here 
sam 
i thought i d catch you here 
 that little smart aleck made me 
 he what 
it wasn t my fault 
he was looking to be covered 
there is a lot of cutsie cutsie
in that little prick 
 i told you 
 you know where he was today 
at the public library reading
thus spake zarathustra   
   by friedrich nietzsche 
the german philosopher 
 he said that god is dead 
 god is dead  right 
we can keep going this way 
but it s going to get expensive 
i m not so concerned about days 
stay on him a few more nights 
do you really want
to resolve this situation 
 yes  i d love to resolve it 
 then i got a suggestion 
there are men that can be hired  by me 
to do a little hospital job on cady 
what are we talking about here 
two pieces of pipe and a bicycle chain 
he won t be so scary after that 
i m a lawyer  are we agreed on that 
maybe 2 000 years ago 
we d have stoned him to death 
i can t operate outside the law 
the law is my business 
 i m home  where is everybody 
 in here 
 evening  ladies  oh  chicken 
how is everything  is everything okay 
 yeah

i m just going down the list 
greeting my summer students 
you sound kind of down 
there s just been stuff
going on around here  that s all 
 anything i can do 
 i doubt it 
shit happens  you know 
like the t shirt says 
yeah 
you know  all that negativity 
you can use that 
what do you mean 
i m the kind of teacher that takes
a very personal interest in his kids 
don t mind me  everything you re
going through  it s okay  go with it 
the awkwardness you feel 
walking down the street   
   and some leering fool is
making fun of your sexuality   
   the turmoil you feel  extra bad when
that time of the month comes around   
   the anger you feel
that your mom and dad   
   won t let you grow up
and be yourself  be a woman 
don t suppress or deny it 
use it in your life and work 
okay  i mean   
i ll have to think about all that 
class is tomorrow in room 110  right 
no  it s been changed to the theater 
 what better place for drama  right 
 yeah 
and remember  danielle  you can use
all those fears to draw upon and learn 
you know this little tune 
 if you want a do right
 all days
 woman

 do right
 all night man

because i m a do right man  okay

 okay 
  bye 
i didn t think summer sessions
would be so crowded 
they re just having a big meeting
about next fall s chorus program 
 i have to go downstairs for drama 
 okay   bye 
hello 
nadine 
i m here for the drama class 
am i busted 
 no 
 i hope not 
you can t smoke grass in school 
privilege of the profession 
eases inhibitions 
you down here for drama 
yeah 
are you the drama teacher 
and you re  let me guess 
cecile james 
no  i m danielle bowden 
danielle  oh  we spoke last night 
yeah 
oh  i m sorry  how rude 
it s okay 
 i think we re alone now 
okay 
thanks  here 
i m going to give this to you 
little trick i learned  take it 
you know when we spoke
on the phone last night 
you really made sense to me 
i thought a lot 
those are human truths 
that s what it s all about 
and that s what we deal with here 
see the book you have  thomas wolfe 
it s all about self discovery 
the inner voyage 
i like the end   
   where eugene s journey was really   
   mystical  you know 
it was almost like a pilgrimage 
almost like a cop out  if you ask me 
though those were the facts of wolfe s life 
the novel is what you would call
a roman à clef 
you know what that is 
sure 
well  nonetheless  you can t escape
your demons just by leaving home 
although writers do find new freedom
when they relocate abroad 
take henry miller 
have you read his trilogy 
plexus  nexus and sexus 
 you haven t read that 
 no 
you re missing something 
you know what 
i did read tropic of cancer 
just parts of it  though   
   because i had to sneak it off
my parents  shelf  you know 
his descriptions are pretty vivid 
i would say 
in one of the novels  i don t recall which   
   he describes an erection
as a piece of lead with wings on it 
 i didn t read that part 
 of course not  you re not allowed 
your parents don t want you
to achieve adulthood 
they know the pitfalls of adulthood 
all that freedom 
they know it only too well 
temptation to stray 
deflecting their guilt and anger onto you   
   for a crime that s not even a crime 
for smoking grass 
wait a second 
where are you from 
where am i from 
 yeah 
 where do you think i m from 
i don t know  but   
if i told you  you going to get mad at me 
i m from the black forest 
that s funny 
you re not the drama teacher  are you 
maybe i m the big bad wolf 
so you re that guy that s been
hanging around the house 
you re the one that killed my mom s dog 
 your mom s dog was killed 
 yeah 
i didn t even know anything about that 
that s a shame 
that s a damn shame 
yes  it was 
what kind of dog was it 
i don t know  he was just   
he was fluffy  and   
fluffy 
so you didn t do that 
of course i didn t do that 
 okay 
 i wouldn t do that 
so why    what are you doing here  then 
well  i came to meet you 
to be honest with you 
 why  i mean   
 because   
   i wanted to meet you 
see what you re like 
i see you re a nice person  that s all 
 you re not going to hurt me  are you 
 i m not going to hurt you at all 
there s no hurting here  danielle 
between us there s no anger  nothing 
just a search for truth 
did you judge me  get angry at me
when you caught me smoking the grass 
no 
but your parents judged you 
got plenty angry at you  didn t they 
yeah 
they punished you for their sins 
what did they do 
my dad   
they just yelled a whole lot and   
   my mom cried   
   and my dad said
i couldn t drive the cherokee 
i d say they punished you
for their sins  and you resent that   
   and you should resent it 
but professor do right has
a little advice for you 
you shouldn t damn them 
don t judge them 
just forgive them 
for they know not what they do 
why do you hate my father 
i don t hate him at all 
oh  no  i pray for him 
i m here to help him 
we all make mistakes  danielle 
you and i have  at least we try to admit it 
don t we 
yeah 
but your daddy  he don t 
every man carries a circle of hell
around his head like a halo 
your daddy  too  every man   
   has to go through hell
to reach his paradise 
you know what paradise is 
 no 
 salvation 
 cause your daddy s not happy 
your mommy s not happy 
and you know what  you re not happy 
 are you 
 no  i m not 
you thought about me last night 
didn t you 
yes  i did 
i know 
you know  i think
i might have found a companion   
   for that long walk to the light 
do you mind if i put my arm around you 
it s okay 
no  i don t mind 
okay 
kersek  where the hell have you been 
he came at my daughter at school 
you asked me to watch him nights 
i m watching nights  what happened 
my wife  leigh  found some marijuana
in one of dani s schoolbooks 
we don t know if cady
gave it to her or what happened 
she s scared and she won t talk about it 
but this has gone far enough 
it s got to stop 
 you phone the cops 
 no  i didn t phone the cops 
what did you call them 
 slow  skeptical pathetic  even  
no  leigh  that s all right 
just hold on a minute 
kersek   
   i want to hire those three guys 
you remember  the hospital job 
consider it done  the sooner the better 
three men are going to cost you a grand 
it s not chicken feed
but you don t go with less than three 
it s better to overdo it 
you ll have the money in the morning 
we ll be on for tomorrow night 
and sam   
   you ll feel good about this 
all right 
do you notice these young people 
they don t look very happy 
they re committed to their professions
and ambitions but not to each other 
cady  shut up and listen 
if you don t leave   
   my family alone
and you don t get out of here   
   you re going to be hurting
like you never dreamed 
 could you repeat that 
 i said   
   if you don t get out of here   
   you re going to be hurting
like you never dreamed 
 a threat 
 yeah 
you bet your ass that s a threat 
i have thought of relocating   
   where i d be more appreciated 
california  perhaps 
   i could teach earthquake preparedness 
but then it hits me 
i love new essex  counselor 
i mean  where else could i just
casually confer with an old colleague 
we re not colleagues 
do you understand that 
 you think you re better than me 
 no  i don t 
that s not the goddamned point 
good  if you re not better than me
then i can have what you have 
 what do i have 
 a wife  a daughter 
i m going to teach you
the meaning of commitment 
fourteen years ago  i was forced to make
a commitment to an eight by nine cell   
   and now you re going to be forced
to make a commitment 
you could say i m here to save you 
fine 
check out the bible  counselor   
   the book between esther and psalms 
you all right 
 is everything all right 
 yeah 
this isn t going to work  you know 
 what isn t going to work 
 locking us in  hiding us from the world 
oh  don t be so dramatic  dani 
 making me stay out of school 
 you re going back to school tomorrow 
and put some clothes on 
you re not a kid anymore 
why am i going back to school tomorrow 
what are you going to do 
that s none of your concern  dani 
dad   
   he didn t force himself on me  you know 
i know you d like to think that he did 
but i think he was   
i think he was just trying
to make a connection with me 
 you know 
 now  dani   
   i want you to listen to me 
no  do you understand 
there will never be any connection
between you   
   and max cady 
you understand that 
did he touch you 
what are you laughing about 
why are you smiling 
i m asking you a question 
did he touch you 
dani  wipe that smile off your face 
i m asking you did he touch you 
oh  wait  dani  i m sorry 
wait  honey  i m sorry 
get out of here 
come on 
counselor 
is that you 
come out  come out  wherever you are 
i ain t no white trash piece of shit 
i m better than you all 
i can out learn you 
i can out read you 
i can outthink you 
and i can out philosophize you 
and i m going to outlast you 
you think a couple whacks to my
good old boy gut will get me down 
it s going to take a hell of a lot
more than that   
   to prove you re better than me 
 i am like god  and god like me 
 i am as large as god 
 he is as small as i 
 he cannot above me
nor i beneath him be  
silesius  17th century 
could you be there 
i wonder if you re here 
ah  fuck it 
if you re here 
what the fuck is the difference 
fuck it 
 i ve got mr  kersek on one 
 good  i ll take it 
sam  you look tired  you get that writ 
no  we have to get into that 
let me just grab this 
 kersek 
 i m damn sorry about last night 
that son of a bitch could survive
a nuclear strike 
hang on a second 
tom  i m not doing it  i pulled a fast one   
   and it s come back and bit me on the ass 
what you did was dumb  what i m asking
is no big deal  this is my daughter 
no  it s perjury 
it s bullshit and i m not doing it 
 all right 
 i ll be in my office 
who was that top criminal lawyer 
lee heller  we need to talk 
if word gets out how cady
bushwhacked those bastards   
   it ll be hard to get three new guys 
i don t want three new guys 
you hear me 
mr  heller  it s sam bowden
from broadbent and denmeyer 
tom speaks very highly of you  he says
you re the best  and that s what i need 
we froze our butts together in korea 
how can i help you  sam 
it s a petition for a restraining order 
but there have been complications 
i know this is short notice 
but i need this injunction 
there s an ex convict named max cady
who s been harassing my family 
i m sorry  mr  bowden 
i can t continue this conversation 
 is there a more convenient time 
 the damn thing is  i have a conflict 
 what would that be 
 you see   
   mr  cady retained my services yesterday 
 he what 
 in fact  i see on my phone sheet   
   mr  cady called this morning 
so i m sure he ll fill me in   
but wait a minute  lee 
this man is a psychotic 
it appears i ll be seeing you
at that hearing after all 
 could you repeat that 
 i said   if you don t leave   
    my family alone
and if you don t get out of here   
    you re gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed  
 a threat 
 you bet your ass that s a threat 
you need only glance
at my client to know   
   that mr  bowden made good
on his heinous and cowardly threat 
just as god arose to judgment
to save all the meek of the earth   
   i hope and pray you will do the same  sir 
your honor   
   mr  cady wouldn t have
surreptitiously taped our meeting   
   unless he knew that he d   
this court does not condone   
   feuds  vendettas or vigilantism 
let me quote our great negro educator 
mr  booker t  washington 
 i will let no man drag me down so low   
    as to make me hate him  
yes 
i will grant the restraining order   
   not to validate the malice between you   
   but in the interest of christian harmony 
you may not come within 500 yards   
   of mr  maximilian cady   
   until such time as the court
may lift the injunction 
king solomon could not have
adjudicated more wisely  your honor 
i am so offended by the philistine tactics
of mr  bowden   
   i petitioned the a b a 
for his disbarment   
   on the grounds of moral turpitude 
now  if you will excuse us  my client   
   is due back at the hospital   
   for the results of his numerous x rays 
kersek  i want a gun 
 i need a gun  i want a gun 
 you want a gun 
yeah  i need a gun 
 know anything about guns 
 i don t believe in them  not in the house 
i ll get you a gun  what kind 
now  calm down 
 something simple i can handle 
 let me see what fits you 
forty five   
let me see your hands 
 a  38 snub nosed special 
 all right  good 
i can teach you how to use it 
 great 
 the first lesson is this   
   don t think of it as trying to kill a man 
 right 
 it s an extension of your fist 
you re just reaching out
and knocking him down 
boom  all right 
later on we ll shoot some trees  okay 
that d be great  good 
what is it  what 
 well  sam   
 yeah 
i give you a gun  you pull it on cady   
   it will dawn on you that shooting
a man is different than shooting a tree 
next thing  you know  cady has the gun 
you ll teach me  i could handle a gun 
he won t take it away 
best case scenario 
you kill cady dog dead 
fifteen years to life 
do you realize that  counselor 
oh  jesus  it s all fucked up  kersek 
i mean  the law considers me
more of a loose cannon than max cady 
some big shit attorney has whipped the
a b a  s ethics committee into a frenzy 
there s an emergency session
in raleigh over the assault 
how did they link that to you 
i went to warn cady 
i thought it was the decent thing to do 
maybe i d scare him  he was wired 
goddamn fools 
this hearing  it s real important 
only if i want to continue to practice law 
cady isn t expected there  is he 
mr  cady  he s beyond reproach 
 but you re required to be there 
 yeah 
 when is this hearing 
 it s thursday morning  9 00 
the torture begins and lasts for two days 
you have to fly up the night before 
right 
cady s an opportunist 
if he thinks you re gone for two days   
   that s going to be as tempting to him
as shit is to a fly 
if cady breaks into your home   
   he can be killed 
justifiably 
but he won t show unless
he s sure you won t be there 
 have a good trip 
 all right  bye bye 
 call us tonight  okay 
 all right 
 i didn t miss the 9 20 to raleigh 
 i m afraid you did  there s a 10 20 
it s not that  i have some
important papers for samuel bowden 
was he on the 9 20 
we can t give out that information  sir 
well  it s just   
   i guess i could send it to him overnight   
   but he might be back  for all i know 
tomorrow morning  and i   
see  i   
my wife and i have been in an accident 
and he s our lawyer 
if i don t get in touch with him 
we could lose this case 
we ve already lost our little daughter dani 
is   
is there any way to know if he was
on that flight and when he s returning 
it d really help us 
he ll be back the day after tomorrow  sir 
bless your heart 
go on in 
get down  sam 
give me a cigarette 
slow down  you re outpacing me
two to one since you started again 
just keep track of how many i owe you 
 how d it go at the airport 
 we did our thing   
   but we don t know if he saw us 
or if he was there 
set the trap and we ll see 
what if we don t want to see 
 dani 
 what 
maybe he poisoned the dog 
sam  watch out for the windows 
you re not allowed to stand up  remember 
 didn t cady go after her 
 you don t know dani 
if she finds a palmetto bug in her bedroom 
she takes it outside 
you know  she could never kill anything 
even a six foot palmetto bug 
oh  god 
what is that 
it s monofilament line 
i got it from sam s fishing gear 
i stretch it across the windows
and the doors   
   and tie it to dani s teddy bear here 
if the bear moves a quarter of an inch 
i know if the holy ghost is sneaking in 
what are you reading 
 why  did kersek quit 
 no 
it s just that cady said   
you want some answers 
me  too 
i d like to know just how strong we are   
   or how weak 
but i guess the only way
we re going to find that out is by   
   going through this 
it s just that cady said to read the book
between esther and psalms 
which is which one 
the book of job 
job was a good man  he believed in god   
   and god tested his faith 
he took away everything he had

 sam  just remember the plan 
 i know the plan 
damn  it s premeditated 
it makes me an accomplice 
an accessory  an abettor 
it s also excessive force 
the only thing excessive
we could do to cady   
   would be to gut him and eat his liver 
that might be excessive 
jesus christ  kersek  i m serious 
no  you re scared 
but that s okay 
i want you to savor that fear 
you know  the south evolved in fear   
   fear of the indian  fear of the slave   
   fear of the damn union 
the south has a fine tradition
of savoring fear 
what s the matter 
don t look over

what would she normally do   
   if sam wasn t around to run her home 
 she d stay

yeah  i know how this looks 
you re not supposed to flee
a murder scene 
listen  lieutenant 
you may not know this   
   but in the law there s something
called force majeure 
it means an unforeseeable act of god   
   and it cancels all promises
and obligations 
so  legally speaking  all bets are off

the part   
   you know what part  you know 
 i don t think you did your homework

the good parts 
yeah  they were   
 were you a good girl 
 i was 
i knew you d follow me here and   
you know me pretty well  don t you 
yeah  i do 
you re going to know me a lot better  too 
are you offering me something hot 
let s get something straight here 
i spent fourteen years
in an eight by nine cell   
   surrounded by people
who were less than human 
my mission in that time was
to become more than human 
you see 
granddaddy used to handle
snakes in church 
granny drank strychnine 
you could say i had a leg up 
genetically speaking 
i m going to forgive you  danielle  honey 
i know that wasn t the real you 
the true you 
but i would like you to wait in the hold 
danielle  get in the hold 
 stop 
 no 
ready to be born again  mrs  bowden 
a few minutes alone with me  darling 
and you ll be speaking in tongues 
excuse me  mrs  b 
please don t take umbrage   
   but in the plan that i have formulated   
   there s much more to it
than just you and i making love 
i mean  that s just so   
   commonplace and dreary 
here and now  we have an opportunity 
 what is that opportunity   you ask 
why  here and now 
we have an opportunity   
   to depict and dramatize   
   both the heights and the depths   
   of a mama s true love of her daughter 
if you get my meaning 
come on out  babe 
come on  darling  let s go 
get out  get up here 
this is between you and me 
leave them out of it 
this is my night  counselor 
don t you step on my lines 
stop 
yes  leigh 
listen to me  max 
you know  max  since all this started   
   i ve thought about you all the time 
i ve tried to imagine
what it must have been like for you   
   all those years  locked up in jail 
i ve tried to imagine you
and even your crimes   
   and how you must have felt
in those moments that you did them 
see  i know about loss  max 
i know about losing time 
even losing years 
and i know it doesn t compare to jail  but   
   i can understand   
   and i could share this with you 
because of that whatever it is
that you ve got planned   
   i want you to do it just with me   
   not with her   
   because   
   we have this connection 
what do you think  counselor 
that was real eloquent  leigh 
brave  too 
i want to thank you for conveying to me
your most powerful emotions   
   because   
   i m going to enjoy this all the more 
oh  my god 
the people call samuel j  bowden 
do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth 
 somebody s got to man the boat 
 did you swear 
 i ll do it 
 sit  danielle 
don t make light of your civic duty 
you re the jury 
all right  i swear to tell the truth 
what do you want to know 
was a prior sexual history ever prepared
in connection with my defense 
it s   
i m sorry  your honor 
that was argumentative 
an investigator did prepare a prior
sexual history on the alleged victim   
   true 
i can ask leading questions  your honor 
he is a hostile witness 
would you care to tell the court
what the gist was of this report 
it was fourteen years ago 
i can t remember that 
how can he answer
when you re hitting him 
because he s perjuring himself 
he knows damn well what it said 
 don t you 
 it said that she was promiscuous 
it said she had three different lovers
in one month 
at least three  and did you show
this report to the d a  
i found it when i started representing
myself six years into my sentence 
but there it was in the court file 
back in  77  you buried it  counselor 
would you care to tell the jury why 
would you care to tell the court why 
because i know he brutally raped her
and he beat her 
talk to me  i m standing here 
just because she was promiscuous
doesn t justify you raping her 
you bragged that you beat two prior
aggravated rapes  you were a menace 
you were my lawyer 
that report could have saved me
fourteen years 
 you re probably right 
 you self righteous fuck 
i m virgil and i m guiding you
through the gates of hell 
we are now in the 9th circle 
the circle of traitors 
traitors to country 
traitors to fellow man   
   traitors to god 
you  sir  are charged with
betraying the principles of all three 
can you please quote for me the a b a  s   
   rules of professional conduct  canon 7 
 a lawyer should represent his client    
 should zealously represent his client
within the bounds of the law  
and i find you guilty  counselor   
   guilty of betraying your fellow man   
   guilty of betraying your country   
   guilty of abrogating your oath   
   guilty of judging me and selling me out 
and with the power vested in me
by the kingdom of god   
   i sentence you to the 9th circle of hell 
now you will learn about loss   
   loss of freedom  loss of humanity 
now you and i will truly
be the same  counselor 
danielle  get down on your knees 
take off your clothes 
down on your knees now 
take off your clothes 
get down on your knees 
don t 
now  off with your clothes 
you  leigh  take off your clothes  now 
come on 
tonight  you ll learn to be an animal   
   to live like an animal and to die like one 
give me your hand 
go 
did you forget about that
restraining order  counselor 
you re well within 500 yards 
well  here we are  counselor   
   just two lawyers   
   working it out 
i m going to kill you 
you already sacrificed me  counselor 
 on jordan s stormy banks i stand
 oh who will come and go with me
 i am bound for the promised land 
we never spoke about what happened   
   at least not to each other 
fear  i suppose   
   that to remember his name
or what he did   
   would mean letting him into our dreams 
and me  i hardly dream
about him anymore 
still  things won t ever be
the way they were before he came 
but that s all right
