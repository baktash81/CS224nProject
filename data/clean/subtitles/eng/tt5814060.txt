in amityville
i had a premonition
of your death
we have both seen the same
inhuman spirit
mom whos that
the demon
in your painting is real
are you certain were
making the right decision
we have no other choice
will the relic truly save us
have faith sister
our father
who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come
thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven
give us this day
our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespass against us
take it
this evil needs a vessel
to escape
it will come after you next
dont let it have you
you know what you must do
i cant
then not even god can save
forgive me father
for the sin
im about to commit
forgive me lord
oh god
father burke
bishop
so the last time you were here
was what night
six seven years ago
after my time as a chaplain
ended in the war yes
well we appreciate you
coming again
under such short notice
father burke
sit
we have received news
that a nun has taken
her own life
at an abbey
in the mountains of romania
suicide is a terrible
terrible sin
but it doesnt strike me
as strong enough reason
for a reunion
but the news of it
would not bolster
our argument to keep
with the faith and the church
youre not telling me something
why do you say that
because were in the vatican
let me put it this way
father
in this albeit
rare instance
we do not believe
were the ones
with the secret
those are
your travel documents
and contact information
on the man
who discovered the nun
he lives near the abbey
in a small village
called biertan
you will want
to talk to him first
also in the file is the name
of a postulant who can help
assist you in your inquiries
since it is
a cloistered convent
and your access
will be limited
shes also familiar
with the territory
i have survived
many terrifying encounters
but nothing could have ever
prepared me for this
my only hope now was that
the beast could not smell me
but then
the wind changed and
run for your lives
mother superior says
that dinosaurs
were never really alive
god just put their bones here
to test our faith
that seems like a pretty
dirty trick dont you think
but theyre not
in the bible
well do you believe
in penguins and koala bears
yes
they arent in
the bible either
the bible is
gods love letter to us
but it doesnt mean that he
doesnt want us to ask questions
about the wonders
of his creation
but mother superior says
wait a minute youve got a
little something on your nose
there
ahem
ooh
the vatican
im as surprised as you
i havent even taken
my vows yet
oh hes aware of that
hes waiting for you
in the garden
and change into your habit
this is an official visit
it shouldnt take
more than a few days at most
you were recommended
for the journey
because of your familiarity
with the territory
the territory
yes romania
id never been
in that part of the world
really
there mustve been
some mistake
i apologize if you coming here
was a waste of your time
oh no no
no apology necessary
every decision the vatican
makes is with purpose
im sure they had their
reasons for selecting you
what is it
mr theriault
hi
jealous husband
or angry father
im sorry what
well usually
its one of the two
when an older man
and a young beautiful
notsoinnocent girl
show up on my doorstep
at this hour of the morning
i beg your pardon
mr theriault
but you and i have never met
oh
oh then perhaps
its time we did
call me frenchie
everyone does
mr theriault we are here
because of the nun
you found at the abbey
howd you
are you priest
and she is a nun
oh
forgive me for
my impure thoughts sister
i had no idea
never seen a nun
out of her vestments
not that im opposed to it
excuse me
monsieur theriault
the abbey
is it far
in matter of distance no
but it takes time to get to
if i may ask
why were you there
i was delivering
the quarterly supplies
apparently the abbey has had
some kind of arrangement
with the village
for centuries
do you think you
could take us there sometime soon
i dont think so father
is there someone else
in the village then
everyone in this village
pretend like the abbey
doesnt exist
even talking about it
might get you in trouble
its settled then
you will take us
with all due respect
father i
please frenchie
you took a plane from rome
a bus from bucharest
now my friends
youre in the dark ages
in the backwoods of romania
now you travel by horse
where are your things
the postmans charge
ten letters with an l
deliveries
you have a knack for this
sister
what brings a frenchman
to the countryside of romania
actually im frenchcanadian
but dont tell anyone
doesnt sound as romantic
i came here looking for gold
but when i met
the people here
i just knew this was the place
i was meant to be
wanted to help them
any way i could
thats very noble of you
i know
tell me sister
how long have you been a nun
im not a nun yet
im still just a novitiate
you still havent taken
your temporary vows
temporary
i didnt think
there was anything temporary
about being a nun
temporary vows
would help prepare me
for a life
of total consecration
would sister or will
whoa
what happened
everything all right
we walk
the rest of the way
the horse wont go
any further
maybe you should get
a new horse
well its not the horse
father
its what lies ahead
hes scared
the locals say
its a cursed place
and the horse agrees
if i may ask father
why is it the church sends you
on such tasks
the church reaches out to me
when it needs an investigation
into unusual phenomenon
associated with catholicism
unofficially they call it
miracle hunting
i thought we were here
because of a suicide
we are but its only part
of our investigation
i also have orders
from the vatican to determine
if the grounds
are still holy
well i can give you
my opinion
on that now father
a result of the war
bombing raids yes
ive heard stories of how the
ground shook for days after them
ive tried to find more
information on the castle itself
but theres no record of it
in the village
and the locals only spit
when its mentioned
spit
yeah to ward off evil
its an old
and silly superstition
and if you ask me
these crosses that surround
the abbey
they keep the evil in
not out
did you try to contact someone
inside when you found the nun
i did
no one responded
but then again
in the two years ive been
delivering supplies
she was the first one
id seen
frenchie when you
found the nun what did you do
i moved it to protect
the body from the elements
where did you move it to son
the icehouse
its where
i leave my deliveries
when i found the sister
i thought
maybe moving her in here
would help preserve her
uh
i should tell you
one more thing father
what
thats not how i left her
what do you mean
she was laying down
when i left her here
not like that sitting up
there have been cases
of bodies twitching
or sitting up
not long after death
yeah but father who knows
how long she was dead
when i found her
youre not helping
sorry
father what is it
it seems to be a key
of some kind
thats the door the nuns
would enter from
to retrieve the supplies
so they wouldnt have
to leave the castle
we should give her
a proper burial
it was common practice
during the plague
when people feared to be
buried alive
if you were unfortunate enough
for it to happen
you could ring the bell
to let those above ground know
they have made a mistake
i think being here
is a mistake
thats where i found her
how is that possible
its been weeks
i told you this place is
whats the opposite
of a miracle father
hello
please excuse us
for our unannounced arrival
hello
what is it you want
im father anthony burke
this is sister irene
are you the reverend mother
i am
you havent taken
your vows yet
uh
no
please
why are you here father
we come on behalf of rome
to inquire about the
recent death in your convent
recent death
one of your nuns
i found her outside
hanged from the neck
would you
allow us a moment please
you should leave
with him
are you saying
you werent aware
of the recent passing
of the nun
rome is concerned
about the safety
and wellbeing
of your cloister
id like to speak
with the sisters
so i can offer my assurances
to the church
i can offer
the assurance you seek
im afraid that wont suffice
they will just send more
and uh
perhaps less diplomatic
church officials
yes father
however the gate
will be closing shortly
as we are about to take
our vespers
followed by the great silence
which ends midmorning
come back tomorrow
and you will find the answers
you seek
there is lodging
in the convent
you may stay there
thank you
why could you
not talk to the sisters now
why must it wait till morning
the sisters take
a vow of silence
from sunset to sunrise
that must be respected
you should begin
heading back yourself
i imagine you dont want to be caught
on those roads when night falls
better the roads than here
father
well be fine son
come back in a few days
that should give us enough
time to get what we need
yes father
hello
hey
hey
ill take that
okay
all right
father
hmm
you mentioned
miracle hunting before
is that
is that a role you sought out
no
god no
im a part
of a small select few
the church relies on to
look into their more
unusual matters
so you know bishop forne
how do you
because he helped me
when i was younger
i had a series of visions
when i was a girl
my father believed
i was mentally unstable
or worse a liar
but word of my visions
reached the church
cardinal conroy specifically
and he sent bishop forne
to meet with me
what were your visions
there were many
never the same one repeated
but after each one ended
the same thought
would be stuck in my head
which was what
mary points the way
what is it father
i was thinking
of a similar incident
i encountered in france
during the war
i was stationed there
near lyon
i was told to investigate
a boy with visions
but unlike your case
after what i believe
was careful evaluation
i made the judgment
he was possessed
and proceeded
to act accordingly
within the laws of the church
my god daniel
what have they done to you
was it a success
the church thought so
they believed the evil
was cast out
but not you
most glorious prince
of the heavenly armies
saint michael the archangel
help me father
come to the assistance
of daniel
whom god has made
in his likeness
behold the cross of the lord
why wont you help me
ye hostile forces
daniel sustained
severe injuries
during the exorcism
ones from which
he could not recover
daniel im so sorry
he died days later
i often wonder
if i was too eager
with my determination
that is a puzzle
father
father
daniel
wait no help
help no
help
somebody
help sister irene help
father father
father
father
help
help me
father
sister
sister irene
father i can hear you
im right here
oh thank god
thank you
hurry
wait wait
thank you thank you sister
how did you get in there
the ground was covered
there is a powerful
evil presence in this place
maybe those books will help
shine a light on our answer
theres more of it
how is that possible
another puzzle
abbess
as requested
we are here to speak
with the nuns
it seems like thats as much
as an invitation as well get
ill go find the abbess
take this
see what you can find out
about it
it was obviously important
to the deceased
sister be careful please
i will father
hello
wait
sister
sister
we mustnt stop praying
even for a second
this convent has had
perpetual adoration
for centuries
the sisters pray in shifts
to maintain a constant vigil
i am so sorry
to have disturbed her
sister ruth has withstood
more than just someone
sneaking up behind her
im sister oana
we were told you were coming
please follow me
what
another round
i told luca
it was on the house
why did she cover
the mirror
its tradition here
when someone dies
you cover the mirror
so the deceased
doesnt see their reflection
and become a ghost
someone died
you didnt hear lucas
daughter committed suicide
i cant believe it
she was just a kid
twelve years old
hanged herself in his barn
hanged herself why
why did addi constantines
crop turn to dust
why was little stefan
struck blind
it is that place the abbey
whatever evil is up there
its leaking out
poisoning us
and that uh couple you took
up there yesterday
who were they
priest and a nun
are they still up there
yeah pick them up tomorrow
you recently discovered a body
up there didnt you
yeah grigore yeah
well i believe youre about
to discover two more
and out of the ground
formed every beast
of the field
and every bird of the sky
and whatever the man
called the demon creature
that was its name
valak
the defiler
the profane
the marquis of snakes
sister
sister irene
sister victorias death
was a terrible tragedy
for the convent
but we still
feel her presence
she was the most devoted
out of any of us
excuse me sister
sister vic
forgive us
were highly protective
of our privacy
some of the sisters
would prefer
i not speak to you at all
we appreciate your willingness
to do so
sister oana
can you tell me about
the history of this abbey
it was built by a duke
in the dark ages
the duke of saint carta
he wrote countless texts
on witchcraft and rituals
in which to call upon
the forces of hell
hell used him
to open a gateway
so that an unspeakable evil
would walk amongst us
but the church
stormed the castle
they sealed the gateway
using an ancient relic
containing the blood
of jesus christ
the church claimed the castle
for their own
and our perpetual
praying began
to secure the abbey
and contain the evil
for centuries it worked
and evil was kept at bay
until the bombs of war
shook the abbey
and evil found another way
to open the gateway
sister oana
last night in the chapel
i saw a nun
she was
she felt anything but holy
do you see her too
ive seen her stalking
the hallways at night
we all have
she looks like us
but shes not one of us
its something unholy
it takes on different forms
to deceive us
and prey on our weaknesses
it appears as a nun so it can
hide among our cloister
until it can corrupt us all
i fear her presence means
the portal has opened again
it made sister victoria
commit the ultimate sin
sister oana
sister ruth is nearly finished
with her prayers
its time you attend to yours
yes sister
you havent taken
your vows yet
no
then this is not a place
for you
you need to leave now
she cant
the gates have closed
you must stay
until they open again
when do they open
sunrise
you must stay the night
sister irene
good night sister
sister wait
yes
sister victoria had this
in her possession
when she died
do you happen to know
what its for
no
now please i must go pray
where are you
you wont find
another way in father
abbess
what is it
that concerns you
im afraid
theres something very wrong
with this place abbess
like many places
in this world
the abbey has a long history
not all good but we repent
that nun i found her
clutching the key
in her hands
what does it open abbess
its too late father
sister irene is lost
abbess
abbess
sister irene
mary points the way
mary points the way
mary points the way
who are you
god save you
sister please come
sister oana
oh god
quiet
the evil grows stronger
get your things and meet me
in the chapel sister
only prayer will
get us through the night
go leave
now
hello
sister oana
how long
have i been dead father
how long
daniel
im sorry
why wont you help me
we need to pray now
and whatever happens
whatever you may see or hear
keep your eyes forward
and dont stop praying
thats the door
the nuns would enter from
to retrieve the supplies
so they wouldnt have
to leave the castle
no no
holy mother of god
frenchie
thought you could use
some help
thank you
but please by all means
next time do use the shotgun
well im saving that
for emergencies father
sister
sister irene
father burke
its father burke
he will help us
sister
sister irene
oh thank god father
are you all right sister
frenchie
what happened
we weve been praying
all of us together
perpetual adoration
its the only thing thats
been holding back the evil
whos been praying
all of us the other nuns
they were here
they were praying
when we were attacked
the nuns tried to warn me
visions
they felt so real
theres no one left
we have our answer father
as if there was
any doubt before
this place is no longer holy
oh father lord jesus
father what do we do
get my bag sister
hand me the cross
put some holy water on it
here hurry
please father hurry
hold it down cover its face
i cast out the demon in you
in the name
of god the father almighty
and the power
of the holy spirit
i ask this in the name
of our father jesus christ
who is coming to judge
both the living and the dead
and the world of fire
that felt like an emergency
were too late
the evil is free
no
for the demon
to enter our world
it must possess a human soul
sister victoria must have been
the last nun in this cloister
you know what you must do
i cant
then not even god can save
it wasnt suicide
it was a sacrifice
so the evil
wouldnt take her soul
i did not understand a word
you just said but uh
sounds like
your investigations complete
so lets get outta here
we cant just leave
oh come on why the hell not
we have to seal the gateway
to contain the evil
the gateway
is in the catacombs
but we cant close it
without the relic
the blood of christ
christ jesus christ
did the sisters tell you
where it is
the abbess was found dead
in the tunnel
to the catacombs
i think i know
where that tunnel is
good then thats where
we look first
but father before we do
id like to take my vows
are you certain
my visions
i now know
they are a miracle of god
and i am ready to commit
my life to him
now that sister
is a noble act
its a shame but
by the authority
entrusted to me
and in the name of the church
i receive the vows
you have taken
i earnestly
commend you to god
that your gift of self
is made one
with the sacrifice
of the eucharist
and might be brought
to perfection
may the love of god
unite you forever and ever
well theres nothing here
there has to be
they told me this key unlocks
a door to the relic
that could be
anywhere in the castle
it is here
dont you see it sister
what
mary points the way
the blood of christ
holy shit
the holiest
only a true bride of christ
can wield something so sacred
wait
what is it
shouldnt we say
a prayer or something first
theres a time for prayer
and a time for action son
now is the time for action
also still feels like a time
for prayer as well father
finit hic deo
god ends here
we need
to search everywhere
to find the gateway
sister irene this way
hello
sister irene
sister
irene
lord jesus in your holy name
i bind all evil spirits
to this fire
protect us from evil
with your holy light
frenchie help me
of course
no
you failed
just as you have failed
everyone in your life
tomorrow a village will be
missing its idiot
you shouldve kept running
when you had the chance
frenchman
i am frenchcanadian
run
frenchie
no
sister
sister irene
in the name of the father
the son and the holy spirit
no no no no no
come on
okay
i hope you dont mind
its called
the kiss of life
its just called that way
its just its not really
frenchie
whats your real name
maurice
thank you
for saving my life maurice
youre welcome
we should get going
into your hands o lord
we humbly deliver
your servants
the nuns of saint carta
they served you in this life
with strength and faith
deliver them now
from every evil
and let them live with you
in perfect grace forever
amen
thought this ground
wasnt holy anymore
it is now
will you stay on in biertan
oh i think
ive had my fill of romania
my father was a tomato farmer
maybe ill try that
for a while
sounds a little boring
for a world traveler like you
certainly hope so
an exorcism can be
very dangerous
not only for the victim
but for anyone in the room
take maurice theriault
his friends
called him frenchie
he was a frenchcanadian farmer
nothing more
than a third grade education
yet after he was possessed
spoke some of
the best latin id ever heard
and like that
an upsidedown cross
started to appear
from within his body
which brings me
to the three stages
