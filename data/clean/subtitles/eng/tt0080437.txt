the company  captain 
where do you think 
moved out with the battalion 
i ve been waiting here for you 
  you took your time getting back 
  i got lost in the smoke 
what happened to your gun 
have you ever seen a
shell shocked horse 
he stomped all over me and got my
rifle  knocked it to smithereens 
well  i suppose horses have as much right
to go crazy in this war as men have 
oh 
what do you think 
what the hell is it 
it s a  one   first
infantry division 
the red one  you think general
pershing will like it 
  oh  sure 
  got the idea from a cap of a hun i killed 
  when 
  oh  about an hour ago 
did he yell out anything 
well  the same old kaiser stuff  you
know   the war is over   all that junk 
  finish it 
  sir 
finish it 
the armistice was signed
at 11 00 this morning 
the war s been over for four hours 
well  you didn t know it was over 
he did 
a quarter of a century later 
that piece of red cloth   
from the dead hun s hat had
become famous all over the world 
it was the insignia of the
1st infantry division 
the fighting first 
the big red one 
twenty four years later  the big red
one was fighting the krauts again 
it was world war ii this time 
we were invading north africa 
hey  griff 
great  thanks  sergeant 
we were his rifle squad 
first squad  1st platoon 
i company  16th infantry 
he called us his wet noses 
griff  he was a hell
of a sharpshooter 
johnson was a pig farmer
with hemorrhoids 
vinci was a street kid who played hot jazz
on the saxophone  and that s me  zab 
i thought i was the
hemingway of the bronx 
you really a book writer 
  yeah 
  what book did you write 
the dark deadline 
  never heard of it 
  never read it 
it s an unpublished mystery novel 
i left it with my mother 
why s a book writer a rifleman 
to come out with a war novel 
meathead  why else  huh 
what about you  griff 
you gonna be a cartoonist   
     for a big newspaper or something 
  mm hm 
say  griff  you do
everything left handed 
everything but shoot 
and play with my pecker 
 watch out  vichy 
here comes the big red one  
vichy 
i always thought vichy was
some kind of soda pop 
no  vichy s the french 
fighting on hitler s side 
yeah  that s why we re wearing these
so they don t shoot americans  huh 
we dropped leaflets so
they know we re coming 
but if they start a fight 
we ll have to kill them 
we were in this war to fight
germans  not frenchmen 
we were kind of hoping they
were feeling the same way 
put your rubbers on and
keep the salt water out 
thanks  griff 
i ll bet the guy that
invented these   
     never figured they d be used on a rifle 
  i never could screw with them 
  how about you  johnson 
  not me 
over on the algerian beach  french
soldiers were reading our leaflets   
and also wondering if
they were gonna fight 
the colonel is stupid not
to believe these leaflets 
we are no good  you 
me  all of us here 
defending this miserable algerian beach
for marshal p√©tain and adolf hitler 
i can t kill an american 
there were four things you
could hear on the boat 
the waves  the engines   
an occasional muffled prayer   
and the sound of 50 guys all
heaving their guts out 
french troops  don t shoot 
we are americans 
don t shoot  we come to fight hitler 
not to fight with you  don t shoot 
hold your fire 
  yes  colonel 
  open fire 
not on americans 
medic  medic 
nail him  griff 
how the hell could you miss him 
hell  he was close enough
to kiss on both cheeks 
what the hell s the matter with you 
i never saw you miss 
medic  over here 
sixteenth infantry  hold your fire 
americans  this is captain chapter 
general tavernier is dead 
americans  i surrender
my troops to your hands 
frenchmen  we do not
accept your surrender 
you surrender only to the enemy 
if you re vichy  fight us 
if you re frenchmen  join us 
we were feeling cocky as hell 
except griff 
in the middle of the
battle  he froze 
it got to griff 
he kept away from the rest of us 
nobody wanted to use the
word  coward   not yet 
how come we re not pushing inland 
red company s carrying the ball 
take your malaria pills 
i wonder what they gave you in the
other war not to get a hard on 
the same stuff you re wolfing
down now  it has saltpeter 
griff s back 
i can t murder anybody 
we don t murder  we kill 
it s the same thing 
the hell it is  griff 
you don t murder
animals  you kill them 
the truth is  none of us had the
faintest idea what war was all about 
we hadn t met the krauts yet 
communications center
caught an american bomb 
these wet noses found the phonograph
and one record undamaged 
look at the faces of these
puppies  schroeder 
they think the horst
wessel song is so   
horst wessel was a pimp who supplied
hitler with baby faces like you 
he was killed in a brawl 
over a whore in berlin 
a poem by a pimp became the
hymn of hitler s party 
is that right  schroeder 
don t want to disillusion
these infants  huh 
you re getting soft 
schroeder used to be tough  in libya 
i saw him murder a german officer 
i didn t murder him 
gerd  i killed him   
when he ran from a fight
with the british 
murder  killed 
it s the same thing 
we don t murder the enemy  we kill 
everything is on the move 
battalion is sending us
to the kasserine pass 
  we re going to choke on panzer fumes 
  not me  schroeder 
let rommel s panzer grenadiers
march behind those tanks 
but not me  i want no more 
i m no damn nazi fanatic like you 
germany is through
singing for adolf hitler 
our brilliant generals
had figured   
that rommel s push would come
at a place called speava   
so they massed most of the
allied forces over there 
but they sent our regiment
around the back way   
through a shit hole called
the kasserine pass 
our squad was on point 
we got an eyeful  all right 
the whole damned afrika korps was
coming through the kasserine pass 
rommel had caught us
with our pants down 
we got tanks  boys  and
infantry with them 
they ll be looking behind the rocks
for antitank guns  so let s go 
  oh  shit 
  let s go 
sergeant  where are we gonna run to 
they ll spot us out in the open 
we re not running 
we re digging in 
digging in 
are you crazy  sergeant 
all right  dig in and let
them roll over our heads 
hey  they re going
off to the right 
guess again  jerk off 
look over there 
jeez 
tanks  they re all over the place 
the war is over for you 
we won 
you lost 
you are in a temporary german
hospital in tunis  sergeant 
our doctors are very impressed
with your recovery 
you should be dead 
we d better get out of here 
you heard what that orderly said 
this is an unmarked hospital 
and they d just as soon blast us 
anybody here from the big red one 
sixteenth 
eighteenth 
where s that big red one man 
what happened at the pass 
you with the 16th 
you one of them goons 
i company  3rd battalion 
what are you doing wrapped
up in that arab bed sheet 
  what happened at the pass 
  we counterattacked after you jokers ran 
we took kasserine  gafsa 
el guettar  tunis 
  we ran rommel right out of africa 
  you mean the big red one took tunis 
we sure as hell did 
this is tunis 
you re right 
we took tunis 
the old bastard just couldn t
face being left behind 
he heard we were shipping
out to invade sicily 
where s the 1st squad 
where s the 1st squad 
out of the original
12 man rifle squad   
the four of us were
the only ones left 
this invasion wasn t gonna
be like north africa 
the beach would be
heavily defended 
so now at least  we could all go
to sicily and get killed together 
i gave the supply
officer a luger for it 
by the way  what were you
doing in that arab bed sheet 
they were shanghaiing
all the combats   
and noncoms and training
replacements for those rebel devils 
where d you steal it  stupe 
my name s shep  not  stupe   i got it
from the st  george hotel in algiers 
i understand you re
an italian  vinci 
how come they let a wop
in this man s army 
i don t think a wop s
gonna fight a wop 
i think all you ll do is drink dago
red and sing  o sole mio  
i like  o sole mio  
the creepy thing about battle
is that you always feel alone 
all you can see are the
guys right next to you   
and the bodies you
keep tripping over 
why are we always sent out 
it s the only damn squad
in the whole u s  army 
  where s the rest of the army 
  there are eight patrols   
checking the villages
for diehard snipers 
anybody wants to transfer 
just let me know 
i want to transfer 
okay  vinci  you re
transferred to the point 
you know how you
smoke out a sniper 
you send a guy out in the open
and you see if he gets shot 
they thought that one
up at west point 
  are you okay  sergeant 
  why 
  you just let vinci walk into a sniper 
  that s why he s here 
we got plenty of
wet noses here too 
you really want to finish

i ll go left  it s your ball 
bravo  bravo 
  you had him in the sights all the time 
  all the time 
you just wanted to see me sweat 
it s punishment for transferring me to the
point  may i rejoin the rear echelon now 
you are transferred
back to the point 
oh  my aching butt 
by now  we d come to look
at all replacements   
as dead men who temporarily had
the use of their arms and legs 
they came and went so
fast and so regular   
that sometimes we didn t even
get to know their names 
truth is  after a while we sort
of avoided getting to know them 
i    i brought some water 
do you know what they call you
four guys down at battalion 
sergeant s four horsemen 
i don t get it  you guys
lived through north africa 
you didn t even get a scratch 
that s because replacements

i ll    excuse me

fighter living in there

to wipe out the krauts without firing
a shot or killing one civilian 
a woman in a monastery 
it s really not a monastery  it s an
asylum for retards and insane people

good for public relations 
killing sane people is okay

it s good stuff for an aspiring novelist 
i mean  at least that s
what i kept telling myself 
i ll be a son of a bitch 
my mother sold my
