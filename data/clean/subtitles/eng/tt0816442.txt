hello rudy
during this national socialist revolution
as much as our nation prospers
we should not decrease
our determination to cleanse ourselves morally
and intellectually from within
education theater films literature the press
these are the supporting pillars
which shape the unique personality of our nation
and that is why we have gathered here tonight
to free ourselves from any intellectual dirt
we will exterminate the illness
that infected germany for the last twenty years
we will completely destroy the chains
that were forged to enslave us
we will fight our enemies
and if that means war
then we will stand by our führer
until the final victory
such a war will see our nation restored
and bring an end to our enemies
the end of plutocrats
the end of communists
and the end of jews
to our great german empire
and to our beloved führer adolf hitler
sieg

the eyes in the faces

and finger his guilt
but things were out of his control
he had cut himself loose

that this would all be for nothing

the bombs were coming thicker now
its probably fair to say
that no one was able to serve the führer
as loyally as me
there once was a ghost of a boy
who liked to live in the shadows of things
so he wouldnt frighten people
what was that
whos speaking
what are you doing
telling a story
why
whose boy
shes telling a story
speak up
start again
there once was a ghost of a boy
who liked to live in the shadows
so he wouldnt frighten people
his job was to wait for his sister
who was still alive
she wasnt afraid of the dark
because she knew thats
where her brother was
go on
at night when darkness came to her room
she would tell her brother about the day
she would remind him
how the sun felt on his skin
and what the air felt like to breathe
or how snow felt on his tongue
and that reminded her
that she was still alive
gentlemen
how is everybody
look at this one
they are starting to conscript grandfathers
hey old man
old man are they your own teeth
together they sat in the forest
and watched the sun rise
and as he disappeared back into the shadows
she waved goodbye for the last time

saving you

papa

what is it my girl
my girl
my girl
its nice to hear you play
i cant hear properly
im going to bed
dont stay up too late you two
your mama told me what you did
i shouldnt have
maybe you had to
i keep thinking about max
wondering where he is
me too
im not sure what it all meant
everything he went through
everything we did
we were just being people
thats what people do
liesel
you are all grown up
all i have learned is that
life makes no promises
so i had better get started
i have always tried to ignore it
but i know this all started with a train
and some snow
and my brother
outside the car the world was
thrown inside a snowshaker
und on a place called heaven street
a man with an accordion heart
und a woman cloaked in thunder
waited for their new daughter
he lived under our stairs
like a quiet owl with no wings
until the sun forgot
what his face was
the book floated down the river
like a red fish being chased
by a yellowhaired boy
for max who gave me eyes
good night your majesty
ive always quite liked
the image of me with a sickle and cape
dark and formidable
unfortunately im far more
ordinary and commonplace
no one intended to destroy a street
named after heaven
it was a misread on a map
no sirens that evening
first were rudys brothers
i read their simple dreams
then i kissed his mother
and stole the meanness
from franz deutschers heart
rosa i caught midsnore
i could swear i heard her
call me a saukerl
then i felt her regrets for not
sharing more of her very big heart
as for hans his soul was lighter
than a childs
i felt his itch for one last tune
on his accordion
and heard his final thought
liesel
over here
just over
your hand
mama papa
papa
papa
rudy
saumensch
liesel
i need to tell you
dont speak
i need to say it
i
rudy
rudy nein
rudy wake up
rudy nein
wake up rudy rudy wake up
rudy kiss me
rudy his soul just rolled into my arms
in my job i am always
finding humans at their best
and their worst
i see their ugliness and their beauty
and i wonder how the
same thing can be both
liesel
max
i have seen a great many things
ive attended all the
worlds worst disasters
and worked for the greatest of villains
and ive seen the greatest wonders
but its still like i said it was
no one lives forever
when i finally came for liesel
i took selfish pleasure in the knowledge
that she had lived her 90 years so wisely
by then her stories
had touched many souls
some of whom i came to know in passing
max whose friendship lasted
almost as long as liesel
almost
in her final thoughts
she saw the long list of lives
that merged with hers
her three children
her grandchildren
her husband
among them lit like lanterns
were hans and rosa
her brother
and the boy whose hair
remained the color of lemons forever
i wanted to tell the book thief
she was one of the few souls
that made me wonder
