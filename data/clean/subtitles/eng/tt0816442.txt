  hello  rudy 
during this national socialist revolution
as much as our nation prospers 
we should not decrease
our determination to cleanse ourselves morally
and intellectually from within 
education  theater  films  literature  the press
these are the supporting pillars
which shape the unique personality of our nation 
and that is why we have gathered here tonight
to free ourselves from any intellectual dirt 
we will exterminate the illness
that infected germany for the last twenty years 
we will completely destroy the chains
that were forged to enslave us 
we will fight our enemies
and if that means war
then we will stand by our führer
until the final victory 
such a war will see our nation restored
and bring an end to our enemies 
the end of plutocrats 
the end of communists 
and the end of jews 
to our great german empire
and to our beloved führer  adolf hitler
  sieg

he passed on the street   
 seemed to look inside him
and finger his guilt 
 but things were out of his control 
 he had cut himself loose   
 and was drifting faster and faster

i ve never heard you
turn down an opportunity   
to give this one some lip

  i hate hitler 
  hitler is a monkey s ass 
stick you  hitler 
you re all i ve got  rudy 
let s go home 
the bombs were coming thicker now 
it s probably fair to say   
that no one was able to serve the führer
as loyally as me 
there once was a ghost of a boy   
who liked to live in the shadows of things   
so he wouldn t frighten people 
  what was that 
  who s speaking 
what are you doing 
telling a story 
why 
whose boy 
she s telling a story 
speak up 
start again 
there once was a ghost of a boy   
who liked to live in the shadows 
so he wouldn t frighten people 
his job was to wait for his sister 
who was still alive 
she wasn t afraid of the dark   
because she knew that s
where her brother was 
go on 
at night  when darkness came to her room   
she would tell her brother about the day 
she would remind him
how the sun felt on his skin   
and what the air felt like to breathe   
or how snow felt on his tongue 
and that reminded her   
that she was still alive 
gentlemen   
how is everybody 
look at this one 
they are starting to conscript grandfathers 
hey  old man 
old man  are they your own teeth 
together  they sat in the forest   
and watched the sun rise 
and as he disappeared back into the shadows   
she waved goodbye for the last time 
oh  liesel 
max 
max 
max 
max 
saumensch 
what are you up to

hey  saumensch  want to play

then let s steal something 
i don t steal  i borrow 
then let s go borrow franz deutscher s bike
und get out of here

are you still angry with me 
for what 
saving you 
nein  rudy 
you re very brave 
papa 
you re home 
what is it  my girl 
my girl 
my girl 
it s nice to hear you play 
i can t hear properly 
i m going to bed 
don t stay up too late  you two 
your mama told me what you did 
i shouldn t have 
maybe you had to 
i keep thinking about max 
wondering where he is 
me  too 
i m not sure what it all meant 
everything he went through 
everything we did 
we were just being people 
that s what people do 
liesel   
you are all grown up 
all i have learned is that
life makes no promises 
so i had better get started 
i have always tried to ignore it   
but i know this all started with a train   
and some snow   
and my brother 
outside the car  the world was
thrown inside a snow shaker 
und on a place called heaven street   
a man with an accordion heart
und a woman cloaked in thunder   
waited for their new daughter 
he lived under our stairs
like a quiet owl with no wings   
until the sun forgot
what his face was 
the book floated down the river   
like a red fish being chased
by a yellow haired boy 
for max  who gave me eyes 
good night  your majesty 
i ve always quite liked
the image of me with a sickle and cape 
dark and formidable 
unfortunately  i m far more
ordinary and commonplace 
no one intended to destroy a street
named after heaven 
it was a misread on a map 
no sirens that evening 
first were rudy s brothers 
i read their simple dreams 
then  i kissed his mother 
and stole the meanness
from franz deutscher s heart 
rosa  i caught mid snore 
i could swear i heard her
call me a saukerl 
then i felt her regrets for not
sharing more of her very big heart 
as for hans  his soul was lighter
than a child s 
i felt his itch for one last tune
on his accordion   
and heard his final thought   
 liesel  
over here 
just over 
your hand 
mama  papa 
papa 
papa 
rudy 
saumensch 
liesel 
i need to tell you   
don t speak 
i need to say it 
i   
rudy 
rudy  nein 
rudy  wake up 
rudy  nein 
wake up  rudy  rudy  wake up 
rudy  kiss me 
rudy  his soul just rolled into my arms 
in my job  i am always
finding humans at their best   
and their worst 
i see their ugliness  and their beauty   
and i wonder how the
same thing can be both 
liesel 
max 
i have seen a great many things 
i ve attended all the
world s worst disasters   
and worked for the greatest of villains 
and i ve seen the greatest wonders 
but it s still like i said it was 
no one lives forever 
when i finally came for liesel   
i took selfish pleasure in the knowledge
that she had lived her 90 years so wisely 
by then  her stories
had touched many souls 
some of whom i came to know in passing 
max  whose friendship lasted
almost as long as liesel 
almost 
in her final thoughts   
she saw the long list of lives
that merged with hers 
her three children 
her grandchildren 
her husband 
among them  lit like lanterns   
were hans and rosa   
her brother   
and the boy whose hair
remained the color of lemons forever 
i wanted to tell the book thief
she was one of the few souls   
that made me wonder
