as silent as you want
theyre eating this shit up
anybody even know his name
brianna
no
im brianna
im nate
im rachel
im ben
zoey
hey did the train
mean anything to anybody
it was horrible we almost died
does that count
no no i mean this is
all part of a puzzle right
so for our groups
we were all lone survivors
so if the rooms were tailored
around our accidents
maybe the last room was designed
for the guy who died in it
okay well
what about your groups
do you think
there was any connection
my group was all influencers
what so your special skills
were selfies
no my special skill
was travel blogging
camping in atacama elephant
sanctuaries in thailand
that kind of thing
got a million followers
made some money
and then this scar happened
my last room was
an exploding hall of mirrors
its just a weird category
is all
i got a letter from my diocese
oh so youre a priest
it called me to some interchurch
seminar or something
when i get there
let me guess five more priests
beginning of a bad joke right
you see in ours
they wanted to see if
if faith helped us survive
well you survived
i keep walking around
up there so lost
i mean
i just dont understand
understand what
why god spared me
maybe thats enough story time
wait wait wait
when i won the game
some vaguely european asshole
tried to strangle me to death
only reason i got out
was because of zoey
so what they just
they let you all go free
they gave me a hug
called me an uber
it was a really
pleasant experience
were just trying
to find a pattern
thats it thats all
theyre betting on something
whats the angle
you cant outthink minos
trying to is just going
to put us all at risk
shes the only one here
who saved somebody
except for herself
so why not listen to her
i heard you on the train
sounds like listening to her
is what got you
back into this mess
elevator clanking
metal creaking
zoey whispers
okay
maybe we should keep moving
rachel grunting

doors of perception
if you cant see
change the view
what are you looking at
what do you see
its a lenticular hologram
what
i can see what you cant see
thats why youll never
be able to solve it on your own
what are they
there are three images
the first ones a pentagram
the second is a cross section
of a nautilus shell
and the third one
is a dna molecule
maybe its fibonaccis sequence
no the golden ratio exists
with all three of those images
wait so what so 16
1618
buzzes
shit
ben groaning
the golden ratio is represented
by the greek letter phi right
yeah

correspond to this
lowercase all of the tiles
are in lowercase
so the symbol for phi is
ive got it i got it

i think its a thank you
its over
were safe now ben
yeah

siren wailing
i only ever
wanted to protect you
you stole everything from me
there was a time when i couldve
said the same thing to you
you know that i lost mother
long before that day
i knew she was reaching her end
that she was making plans
so i decided to test her
claire youre hurting me
still i hoped
that it wasnt true
i hoped that my own mother
could love me
for who i really was
put them back put them back
i want them all
i wasnt afraid
i followed my curiosity
wherever it led
and i was smarter
than both of you
parents are supposed
to love their children
theyre not supposed
to throw them away like trash
why are you crying
you need help honey
you can help me
not in the way you need
youre going to go away
for a while
i even tried to show you
how useful i could be to you
by getting rid of her
and how did you repay me
you stole all of my ideas
you took all of the credit
claire calm down
i created
such beautiful rooms for you
and no matter how high
the profits soared
you still censored
and stifled me
honey we could be together
we could be a team
you and mom are gonna
be so proud of me
when you see
what i can really do
