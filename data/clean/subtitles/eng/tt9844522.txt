zoey 
hey  did the train
mean anything to anybody 
it was horrible  we almost died 
does that count 
no  no  i mean  this is
all part of a puzzle  right 
so for our groups 
we were all lone survivors 
so if the rooms were tailored
around our accidents   
maybe the last room was designed
for the guy who died in it 
okay  well 
what about your groups 
do you think
there was any connection 
my group was all influencers 
what  so your special skills
were selfies 
no  my special skill
was travel blogging 
camping in atacama  elephant
sanctuaries in thailand 
that kind of thing 
got a million followers 
made some money 
and then this scar happened 
my last room was
an exploding hall of mirrors 
it s just a weird category 
is all 
i got a letter from my diocese 
oh  so you re a priest 
it called me to some interchurch
seminar or something 
  when i get there   
  let me guess  five more priests 
beginning of a bad joke  right 
you see  in ours
they wanted to see if   
if faith helped us survive 
well  you survived 
i keep walking around
up there  so lost 
i mean 
i just don t understand 
understand what 
why god spared me 
maybe that s enough story time   
wait  wait  wait 
when i won the game 
some vaguely european asshole
tried to strangle me to death 
only reason i got out
was because of zoey 
so  what  they just   
they let you all go free 
they gave me a hug 
called me an uber 
it was a really
pleasant experience 
we re just trying
to find a pattern 
that s it  that s all 
they re betting on something 
what s the angle 
you can t outthink minos 
trying to is just going
to put us all at risk 
she s the only one here
who saved somebody
except for herself 
  so why not listen to her 
  i heard you on the train 
sounds like listening to her
is what got you
back into this mess 
 elevator clanking 
metal creaking 
zoey  whispers  
okay 
maybe we should keep moving 
 rachel grunting

   ben groaning 
ben 
um  okay  so insects 
we have a mayfly
and then a termite 
it s an african
mound building termite 
they can live
for up to 50 years 
mayflies only live a day

it s something to do
with the life cycles 
   exclaims 
  oh  shit  okay 
so we have
iridium  titanium  lithium 
the atomic numbers for that
are 3  22  77

moments in greek history 
the battle of troy  1250 b c 
the olympic games  which is   
776 b c 
and then the third tile
is pericles 
he lived from 495 to 429 
none of the puzzles make sense 
we re missing something 
   ben shouting 
  ben  hang on 
zoey  what are you doing 
talk to me 
 you ll never be able
to solve it alone  
you can t do it on your own 
and you re stuck in a box 
why would he do that 
just to taunt you 
doors of perception 
if you can t see 
then change the view 
claire 
we don t have time 
my dad is gonna be here
any minute now 
what are you doing  talk to me 
we can work this together 
doors of perception 
if you can t see 
change the view 
what are you looking at 
  what do you see 
  it s a lenticular hologram 
  what 
  i can see what you can t see 
that s why you ll never
be able to solve it on your own 
  what are they 
  there are three images 
the first one s a pentagram 
the second is a cross section
of a nautilus shell 
and the third one
is a dna molecule 
maybe it s fibonacci s sequence 
no  the golden ratio exists
with all three of those images 
  wait  so  what  so 1 6 
  1 618 
   buzzes 
  shit 
 ben groaning 
the golden ratio is represented
by the greek letter phi  right 
yeah 
but how does that
correspond to this 
lowercase  all of the tiles
are in lowercase 
so the symbol for phi is   
  i ve got it  i got it 
  okay 
it worked 
are you okay 
i m not going back in there

 whimpering 
thank you 
after you escaped  the clients
begged for an encore 
a game of champions 
we started letting people win

when i went through the sand 
there was a guy waiting 
and he gave me this 
i i don t know
if it s a threat or   
i think it s a  thank you  
it s over 
we re safe now  ben 
yeah 
it s over 
 siren wailing 
i only ever
wanted to protect you 
you stole everything from me 
there was a time when i could ve
said the same thing to you 
you know that i lost mother
long before that day 
i knew she was reaching her end 
that she was making plans 
so i decided to test her 
claire  you re hurting me 
still  i hoped
that it wasn t true 
i hoped that my own mother
could love me
for who i really was 
put them back  put them back 
i want them all 
i wasn t afraid 
i followed my curiosity
wherever it led 
and i was smarter
than both of you 
parents are supposed
to love their children 
they re not supposed
to throw them away like trash 
why are you crying 
you need help  honey 
you can help me 
not in the way you need 
you re going to go away
for a while 
i even tried to show you
how useful i could be to you
by getting rid of her 
and how did you repay me 
you stole all of my ideas 
you took all of the credit 
claire  calm down 
i created
such beautiful rooms for you 
and no matter how high
the profits soared 
you still censored
and stifled me 
honey  we could be together 
we could be a team 
you and mom are gonna
be so proud of me   
when you see
what i can really do
