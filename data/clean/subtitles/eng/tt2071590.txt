actually only one groove
on a record
its true
yeah it looks like all these
individual circles
but no its just one
one single line
1500 feet of it to be exact
a third of a mile carving
its way round and round
in circles until
it finally just ends
to make a record it
takes 100 tons of pressure
applied under 1000 degrees
of heat
all to create
this perfect vinyl platter
now what music
goes on the record
well thats where i come in
i am a record man
he taught me how
to watch
fight and pray
hey
whoo
fight and pray
sing it
and in rejoicing
every day
every day
that right there
ah that is why im here
mr hawkins

breaking records
lightning in a bottle

hmm
alright the choir
wasnt actually there
when i got arrived
i didnt get up the stage
and perform the song
but you know what
i could have
hell of a lot more fun
to tell it that way though
you realize that thats
gonna be the problem
with all these stories right
listen im not im not sayig
that people are gonna be lying
its just okay
well some of them might be
its just that memories
memories are complicated
you know
we remember
what we wanna remember
and we forget
what we need to forget
to be at the heart of something
as impossibly successful
as what we had
gladys knight
the isley brothers
bill withers parliament
the village people kiss
and donna
its how do you expect me to
tell you
how all that really happened
couple guys broke as we were
to making
over 100 million a year
i mean first youd have
to understand our crew
because there was just no one
else ever like them
cecil was my best friend
he was also a record executive
who loved the artists
and the music
even more than the business
and the artists themselves
oh my god
they sure loved him
and trusted him
more than they ever trusted me
larry was a music fan
long before he ever became
an executive
it was why he was so effective
staying out on the road
with the bands
he was also my cousin
and all great business
is family
buck had been a shortorder
cook before he married nancy
our pr man
he was the connection guy
who could convince
just about anyone
to do just about anything
and nancy
god every dj
and radio program director
just loved nance
she was our secret weapon
getting our music on the air
and into your lives
she was also my wifes sister
beth was um
well she was the first person
who ever believed
my dreams could be
more than just dreams
she was the first one
to ever truly believe in me
and joyce
you know i may have met her
as kisss manager but
well well get to joyce
just give me a little time
look i know that weve been
blamed for a lot of bad things
that happened
and im not saying
its not sex drugs and rock
and roll because it was
its just it was sex before
it was deadly you know
and finding out who wasnt
doing drugs would be
a hell of a lot harder story
for you to tell
but if what youre after
is the truth
of not just what happened
but how it happened
then you know youre
just gonna have to believe
all of it because every
single bit of it
was true
even the parts that werent
everybody everywhere
los angeles
february 18 1974
theres a hell of a lot
that comes before that night
but the story you want
to hear
well this is
where it all really begins
having moved out to california
only two months before
we were throwing
the biggest party los angeles
had ever thrown
to launch casablanca records
the biggest
independent record label
anyone had ever launched
absolutely i am hit me
and we only had one
band to do it with
and they were well
they were uh different
i think this was a mistake
we should not let them go

are you really gonna
put those guys up there
wearing those stupid costumes
and that stupid makeup
its who they are joe
nobody knows who they are yet

at warner brothers
and people are talking
and theyre not talking
the way you want to hear
you know what theyre
not talking about joey huh
shit that doesnt scare them
nelly were ready
yeah or excite them
or make em want to dance
or laugh or fuck or cry
or fucking matter at all
thank you because the fact
that people are talking
thats music to my ears
and you really spent all
the three million dollars
warners gave you as
an advance
actually
i spent four million
show time neil
ooh sounds like theyre
playing my song
yeah well just remember
the house always wins
even against you
you wanna bet

they took that stage
the town just hated them
about the time

even she had heard
what a disaster it had been
from the day i married her
she always knew
the truth i was hiding
she just
didnt always admit it
hey you okay
your sister tell you
what happened tonight
yeah
even with everything
that had happened
along the way
wed still always been
better together
they uh say the biggest sin
of a record man
is believing in something
because you have to
not because you do
but i had believed in kiss
and i knew
what casablanca could be
get yourself together
but after the party the town
was already celebrating
the death of casablanca

bruce the boys have concerns
about how were
handling casablanca
actually brucie
the boys here are concerned
that you might be a spineless
little cocksucker

any actual proof
about the cocksucking
but we all know and no one
heres gonna judge you bruce
fuck you and fuck you
you see that mo
hes trying to fuck me
i dont blame him
nobody gives a shit
about kiss
were you not at the party
this aint got a damn thing
to do about the party and you
know it
oh youre right about that
its about the fact that they
cant cut a radio hit
their bullshit stage tricks
make them a fucking joke
not an act thats why
their records not selling
i wanna play you
a little something
from our newest record
youre an asshole bruce
mo just take a listen

wed lost every hand
no no its dance music right
there is no other voice
like her
its worse than we thought
what
donnas not selling anywhere
no one knows
what to make of her
r and b doesnt want her
pop doesnt get her
shes just
different
the songs dead man
you were wrong
about the gaines girl
its summer okay
its donna summer
well you were wrong about her
too man
hello
by 1975 wed done
everything we could think of
to introduce donna to the world
right in my heart
the world just didnt care
you said that he loved the song
that he was so sure that it
would change everything
the song is over ladonna
i was wrong
just because the audience
doesnt hear it
does not mean it isnt there
sometimes it just takes time
but we were out of that too
neil dont do this
hey you called me bill
to talk about it not so that
you could do
whatever youre gonna do
this came from steven tyler
himself
called and said if we dont cut
the pyro and get a smaller
sound and lighting rig we
gotta pack it up and go home
well he is the headliner so
bill you have to trust us
well i thought
we were the us
were their managers joyce
you and me
neil im begging you
please dont gamble on this
we should have parked closer
and sometimes
they hear it
even when they dont know it
hey mr aerosmith
what kind of rock and roll pussy
are you
you show us
everything youve got
you keep on dancing
and the room gets hot
you drive us wild
well drive you crazy
ah
you say you want to go
for a spin
the partys just begun
well let you in
you drive us wild
well drive you crazy
come on
you keep on shouting
you keep on shouting
come on
i want to rock and roll
all night
and party every day
i want to rock and roll
all night
and party every day
i want to rock and roll
all night
and party every day
i want to rock and roll
all night
and party every day
they love them
when they see them
so why the hell cant we
get them to buy their records
you drive us wild
well drive you crazy
you keep on shouting
i just
you keep on shouting
i need i need more time
i want to rock and roll
all night
and party every day
i want to rock and roll
all night
and party every day
you lost us an aerosmith tour
the tour was already lost gene
aerosmith doesnt want you
anywhere near them alright
no headliner does
your
your show
scares the hell out of everyone
so you want us
to scale everything down
cut the pyro and the lights
no no no no
if youre gonna be a headliner
were gonna need to make
everything all that much bigger
alright
that means more explosions
and so much so much louder
i have this guy alright
hes got these risers that
you really think that more fire
and some forklifts
are gonna be
what finally breaks us through
no
no it is gonna be
the music
and it was always gonna be
the music but we might
just make enough noise
to to get enough people
to actually listen to it
to pay attention
why did you sign us
our demo was good not great
even i can admit that
you had to know
how hard this was gonna be
why take the risk
because your real name
is chaim witz
and you moved here from israel
when you were eight years old
speaking nothing but yiddish
because pauls real name
is stanley eisen
because two kids from queens
had dreams about being
the next gods of rock
and little neil bogatz
from the brooklyn projects
thinks he can make
everybodys dreams come true
if hes just given
a little more time
you know your demo
really was that great gene
yeah raw and honest
rock and roll
even without all the costumes
but i tell you
what your real brilliance is
and i dont even think
you know this
its that you write
every single one of your songs
with the same four
god damn chords
that means that any
any 14yearold kid
can go out there
and buy a guitar
and within 20 minutes
they can be you
and that matters gene
that is who you are
now why did you sign
with me huh
brandnew label
with you as our only act
you had to know you were taking
as much of a risk as we were
because you
never should have gotten
out of the brooklyn projects
and yet here you are
here we are
two imposters
only if were wrong
i get that you like to gamble
but what if joey was right
in the end what if the house
does always win
well then we raise the stakes
so high
that we become the house
two hundred grand more
youre still upside down
the last hundred
why dont you make it
a personal loan then
dont do this
you go upside down this big
it dont matter
how much i fucking love you
hey you ever gambled
yourself joey
that thumping in your chest
right before that dealer
turns over your next card
anything is possible
right before that moment
neil im telling you
im not gonna be here for you
this time if you dont pay off
are you gonna give me
the money or not
no
two hundred
two hundred
i know its bad
i just wish you would be honest
and tell me how bad
its its its fine
no its not fine
were not fine
none of this is fine neil
we were fine when we were
on the floor of our home
in new jersey when i was
teaching you even how to read
those books
and now we are broke
and you are giving
the guys bonuses
hey no did you sister tell you
that buck was the only one
that took it
maybe he was the only one
smart enough to
hey hey
come on
just dance with me
oh
you stopped dreaming again
you did
you know what i dream of
its that youre actually here
with us neil
and not in new york or las vegas
or wherever else

beth i love you come on

mattered right now

nobodys buying our records

to survive

when he died
you think it was worth it
dying so young
but then having
all that success

and having all that success
would be worth it
you promised our distributors
a sure thing
so theyll keep letting us ride
on everything else
well its johnny carson
it is a sure thing
besides a bet is only a bet
if it matters
its a wedding night
and youre both virgins
its disgusting
abe abe

because youve always trusted
talk to me
theyre not waiting for carson
what
theyre returning
all the unsold kiss albums
and donna and parliament
everything
thats
too many fucking records man
no shit buck
what do we do
we take em back
but you tell
every single fucking one of them
if they do
they dont get carson
neil neil
what
what if were wrong
about carson
i mean
were shipping gold more
over 750000 copies already
and with the money
were spending
on on commercials
and and print ads
its johnny fucking carson
and nobody understands
why the hell
were even doing it
then ship more
spend more do you job
and make them understand
this is gonna be
the biggest fucking album
of the year okay folks
youve lost your mind
did you not hear
what they said on the phone
and theyre on our fucking side
nobody is on our fucking side
because nobody understands
what the fuck
youre doing anymore
not even me
we were wrong
about kiss neil
and we were wrong about donna
even george
and his fucking spaceship
we were just wrong
and here we are still betting
money we dont even have
on them
i cant even pay my
if were wrong about carson
we are not fucking wrong cec
not about any of them
we just havent figured out
a way to finally be right
what the hells happening
i dared question the postmans
son from brooklyn
and he didnt like
what he heard
oh is that right cec
is that the same postmans son
been carrying your ass
from nowhere to somewhere
your whole fucking career
excuse me
tell me this
did you believe
we would make it this far
now be honest
do you believe that we could
actually go further
so you do your fucking job
and i will go get
the fucking money
uh
he didnt mean that
cec shit
and now ladies and gentlemen
heres johnny
the carson albums
still considered
one of the biggest disasters
ever conceived
in the record business
the joke was that wed shipped
gold but returned platinum
just wasnt a joke
wed given away
so many promo copies
that when the stores started
returning them to get
their money back we were
on the line for every last one
and it was killing us
killing us because i was wrong
biggest sin of a record man
believing in something
because you have to
not because you do
i fucking begged you
to pay back that money neil
you kept sayin
waiting for carson
and i convinced them to wait
because this is me and you
but theyre done waiting
im sorry
its okay joe just tell them
not the arm
i sign contracts with
i remembered my dad
remembered my promise
to never become
anything like him
i just cant remember
the exact moment when i did
egg cream
just get us
the fucking money neil
i fucking hate la
jesus
neil
jesus
its not that he was a postman
its just
i knew that he knew
thats all he was ever gonna be
here
im scared
come on shh
im scared
shh just our little secret
brother
can we get something
to clean him up
you want a cigarette
youre alright
its okay
okay come on
get him up walk it off
walk it off
oh fuck
come on
fuck
if we cant sell enough kiss
records on our own
then folks
we are gonna need an army
its merchandise nelly
its a movement nance
i love kiss but how the fuck
are we gonna get people
to buy shit about the album
and we cant even get them
to buy the fucking album
because kiss has always been
about the experience
buck and that is where
we have failed
if youre not in
the kiss army oh
then you are not
in the kiss army
you dont get
the limited edition posters
the signed tshirts
the comic books
so we have comic books now
yes created specifically
for the kiss army
and the only way to get
into the kiss army
is to buy their albums
thank you
now we have one very important
question to answer
what color do we paint
the building
hundred bucks to whoever gets
the the best color
okay can we just um
can we just get a minute
thank you thank you so much
what about black
can you imagine
the whole fucking block
was painted fucking black
no i cant
oh
neil you are my brother
and if you want me to go
off this cliff with you
ill even be the first to jump
but you have got to help me
understand why
we are broke
yes yes that is exactly
what all of these fuckers
are saying
so by tomorrow
i want an entire crew
no two crews outside
painting the entire block
and i want you to pay them extra
to do it slowly
the longer
theyre out there working oh
the longer people are just
gonna drive by and see em
see em doing what
painting the building
were gonna place one
final bet
on who
on us
it started with a makeover
of the building
but to the town we were
building our own makeover
i mean every day
wed announce a new promotion
but in real life we were
just swapping titles around
like the paint colors
of the building
we called everyone we owed
hyped every plan we had
making most of it up
as we went along
we made them root for us
mo
not against us
where the fuck
is all the money coming from
nowhere there was none
we we just made everyone
believe there was
we bet everything we had
on everyone
we already believed in
shes a stonecold stunner
wed gone as far as we could go
as fast as we could go

seven million dollars in debt
well until that night

to the top
of those stained glass windows

that you could be more
than just that girl in a church

performing
halfway across the world
getting further and further away
from that stained glass

sixteen minutes and 50 seconds
with the record
glued to the turntable
it played all night long
with frankie still locked
in the bathroom
lawyers were calling
even before we landed
back in la
swearing theyd never play
a casablanca record again
except something happened
something that never had before
not just in new york
stations all across the country
are calling everybodys trying
to find a way to play her
tell them ill buy them all
buy what all
the whole halfhour block
on every station
every city
the ad campaign
tune in at midnight
for a halfhour of love
brought to you by casablanca
call giorgio
and then
call everybody else
love to love you baby
do it to me again and again
we released our version of
love to love you in 1976
and when we did
it was like nothing else
there ever was
branded too graphic
by some critics
it was even banned
by some stations
which only helps us
to sell more records
oh love to love you baby
time magazine reported
22 simulated orgasms
in the song and the more people
talked about it
the more they wanted more
i mean we were riding
the biggest single we ever had
with the biggest artist
we ever had
and we were literally making her
up as we went along
oh love to love you babe
is this makebelieve mama
no sweetheart this is real
i need makeup in here
we brought in everything
designers hair makeup
in the end we went with wigs
in every picture
youve ever seen
we invented every detail
but the truth
was that the first lady of love
the superstar
we were selling her as
was as far
from who donna really was
as she could be
i want to know this woman
you raised my vocal
in the song
your vocal is the song
bad girls
talking about the sad girls
sad girls
talking about bad girls
yeah
see them out on the street
at night
picking up
all kinds of strangers
if the price is right
and you can score
if your pockets tight
plus you want a good time
you ask yourself
who they are
like everybody else
they come from near and far
shes gonna be great i know it
i love you
you got it donna nailed it
ladonna
so what happens next
you do
dim all the lights
sweet darling
cause tonight
its all the way
turn up the old victrola
gonna dance the night away
love just dont come easy
no it seldom does
when you find
the perfect love
let it fill you up
dim all the lights
sweet darling
cause tonight
its all the way
hey baby
turn up the old victrola
gonna dance the night away
donna was
every one of our dreams
wrapped up
in a onceinalifetime voice
that didnt just rise up
to those stained glass windows
she smashed right through them
now when people
who remember casablanca
actually remember casablanca
this is what they remember
donna on top of the world
as if this was the moment
that began it all
up
hey baby
dim all the lights
sweet honey
having spent my entire life
inventing my life
id now invented hers
that voice the way donna
would just flow inside you
that came from something
far more inventive than me
but the first lady of love
the queen of disco
that was as much of a fairy tale
as i was
lets replace gladys with donna
and suddenly
for the first time
it wasnt just breaking one hit
because once donna broke
the hits
just never stopped coming
i knew what else
wed did wrong too
recording a live album
of greatest hits
from a band
who doesnt even have one
thats new neil even for us
hey theyve always had hits
we just failed to record them
in the way
they needed to be heard
by recording kiss live
we finally captured
the experience of kiss live
which is what wed really been
chasing from the very beginning
turned out wed been right
about them too
we sold
over nine million records
every bet wed made
we were right about all of them
we just needed enough time
for all of you
to catch up to us
what is this
what are you doing
oh my god al
welcome home ma
nelly i already have a house
yeah well this ones bigger
love you
are you nuts
what are you doing here
al look
we dont need this come on
what
no no that is too much
i can only do all this
because you taught me
who taught you
i taught you nothing
taught you how to lose
no you taught me how to win
you taught me
to swing for the trees
to bet big to win big
you remember
you taught me how to dream
maybe a little bit
no maybe a lot
and you know maybe you were
just a little unlucky
right well i got your luck
ah nah
you made your own luck
youre a genius
youre a fucking jewish genius
ah come on
hey
youre a good son bubbeleh
fourcolor world pop
im in heaven
jesus christ
you know what if you cant
keep the beat
lets just fucking spell okay
thats right we created
the village people too
ymca became
one of the alltime
biggest selling singles
more than ten million copies
though other than the cop
none of the others even sang
not on the records
not at the concerts not ever
again lets go again
you dont trust me look it up
we went from living
on the brink of bankruptcy
to earning five million dollars
in one month
six the next
beth i hear you calling
i finally even let kiss
release beth
on the destroyer album
it would hurt
every single time i heard it
but it was the smash
wed been chasing
since it all began
now this is a love story
youre the best fake boyfriend
i ever had
just a few more hours
and ill be right home
to you
i think i hear them calling
oh beth what can i do
beth what can i do
beth i know youre lonely
and i hope
youll be alright
cause me and the boys
will be playing
all night
as for donna
even with all her success
i dont really believe
ladonna adrian gaines
ever really became donna summer
we just made you all think
that she had
so truth is none of us
were still who wed been
when it all began
casablanca had become
something else
i had become something else
okay neil
whats this all about
we sold half the company
to polygram
fortynine percent
we still keep control
weve lived an awful lotta
years pretending to be rich
you wanna see
what it feels like
when we finally actually are
nelly
jesus christ
um im sorry im sorry
i never use the lords name
in vain but
fifty million dollars
for just half the company
made out to neil bogart
a name and a life
id made up along the way
even paid mo back every penny
not because i had to
but because i could
my dad had been right
most were all still there
on the same four blocks
of their lives
for those of you who dont know
i left casablanca finally
on february 8 1980
it was a friday
it was five days
after my 37th birthday
now disco had officially died
the year before when a local dj
set a bunch of records on fire
to the roar of a crowd
as if that was
a fucking concert
yeah it was a good bet
most of those were ours
now all of you remember
im sure
donna and kiss and george
village people gladys
the isleys bill withers
all the others
but i bet each of you 100
that not one of you
has ever even heard of my name
and thats okay its not like
i had the talent that they did
because i didnt you know
or that i or that i mattered
like they did
because uh i i couldn
but i sure as hell
made you dance
i sold over
200 million records
and all that music
that i helped made possible
became the soundtrack
of your lives
and we we were in the
business of making dreams come
trues
didnt we do that
and if we did
didnt didnt that matter

even if even if only a song

to be told
you had a lot of resilience
you have been up and down
and youve made a lot of money
and youve been
flat on your bum
its nicer being up
yes
if that was the question
why your resiliency
where does it come from
wheres that drive come from
probably it originally comes
from brooklyn
brooklyn
you know all people
that are born in brooklyn seem
to be able to bounce back
because you have to
if you come from there
you have to have the desire
to succeed and be a gambler
and i both have the desire
and am a gambler
so you were poor
yes
mmhmm
i came from brooklyn
and i used to sing on
the street corners and stuff
do you think i mean what
does it take to be a greaser
i mean
you got what it takes
you probably got what it takes
what do you think is
the biggest misunderstanding
about neil bogart
there are quite a few
misunderstandings
about neil bogart
if you feel like rocking
the hollywood bowl
it feels like being rocked
howd you get
so down and out neil
i came out to california
after having a company
called buddah records
in new york city
which was very successful
and i went into partnership
with warners brothers records
inside of eight months
the partnership
had just about dissolved
and i lost the quickest
three million dollars
anybody ever put up
for anybody else
what does it feel like
to lose
a couple of million dollars
well the strange thing is
i really didnt have it
you know
of course
i dont think if i had it
i could have taken the risk
you know
it was a kind of situation
where i just kept going and
really didnt stop to think
of how i was going
to pay it back
and fortunately success
was around the corner
and i was able to pay it back
and come from behind
you did it by giving
first of all
one of the largest parties
ever given in this town
didnt you
yes it was
he laughs about it
and you couldnt leave
a tip right
at the end i couldnt
the party was fabulous
the reception was fabulous
the welcome to california
was exciting
and from there
everything went downhill
about eight months later
i realized that um
it wasnt going to happen
i had just finished
probably the most expensive
album ever done
in the record industry
which was
heres johnny magic moments
from the tonight show
and we opened
oh you did that
yeah that was our record
you all bought that
didnt you
yeah
we overadvertised
and we overpromoted
and we did everything
you could possibly do wrong
and i went to acapulco
and while i was there
scuba diving
i thought that you owe
three million dollars
you dont have any money
left in the bank
yeah
you might have payroll
for about two
or three weeks left
and i was down there
and i took the mouthpiece out
and said it could be over
i mean that could be it
you dont have to come back
to the problems
you dont have to come back
to face the failure
and um the last record
i released at buddah records
was a thing
by gladys knight and the pips
that when la seemed
too much for the man
he couldnt make it
so hes leaving
the life hes come to know
hes leaving on a midnight
train to georgia
and i just realized
that wasnt me
i had to win or i had to fail
i couldnt cop out
and i put
the mouthpiece back in
i swam and found joyce
i said come on back
were going upstairs
were gonna go back
and were gonna do it
were going to win
or were gonna fail
and in the back of my head
i always had the thought
that i can always go
back to brooklyn and open
a candy store
yeah
except there are a lot of those
there arent there
yeah but you know
growing up there i mean
that was always
a kind of comforting thing
that i could always go
back to that
and that was a great life
