actually only one groove
on a record 
it s true 
yeah  it looks like all these
individual circles 
but no  it s just one 
one single line 
1 500 feet of it  to be exact 
a third of a mile carving
its way round and round
in circles until   
it finally just ends 
to make a record it
takes 100 tons of pressure
applied under 1 000 degrees
of heat 
all to create
this perfect vinyl platter 
now  what music
goes on the record 
well  that s where i come in 
i    am a record man 
  he taught me how  
  to watch  
  fight and pray  
hey 
 whoo 
   fight and pray  
sing it 
  and in rejoicing  
  every day  
  every day  
that  right there 
ah  that is why i m here 
mr  hawkins 
you got call in requests
breaking records 
lightning in a bottle 
yet no one east of here
has ever heard it

 all making offers right now 
 five other labels  mr  hawkins 
and you ve only spoken
to the head of one of them 
now  give me this song
and i promise you 
we will own radio 
i mean 
a gospel pop crossover 
no one s ever done

and i promise you
right here in this church
before god 
there is just no one better 
no  no  you called me
mr  hawkins  not reverend 
i m not pretending there s not
a line 
i am just respecting when
to cross it 
  oh happy day

in height or weight 
because that right there
is about four inches 
mm 
yes 
  oh happy day

hmm 
alright  the choir
wasn t actually there
when i got arrived 
i didn t get up the stage
and perform the song 
but you know what 
i could have 
hell of a lot more fun
to tell it that way  though 
you realize that that s
gonna be the problem
with all these stories  right 
listen  i m not    i m not sayig
that people are gonna be lying 
it s just    okay 
well  some of them might be 
it s just that memories 
memories are complicated 
you know 
we remember
what we wanna remember 
and we forget
what we need to forget 
to be at the heart of something
as impossibly successful
as what we had   
gladys knight 
the isley brothers 
bill withers  parliament 
the village people  kiss 
and donna   
it s    how do you expect me to
tell you
how all that really happened 
couple guys broke as we were
to making
over  100 million a year 
i mean  first  you d have
to understand our crew 
because there was just no one
else ever like them 
cecil was my best friend 
he was also a record executive
who loved the artists
and the music
even more than the business 
and the artists themselves   
oh  my god 
they sure loved him   
and trusted him 
more than they ever trusted me 
larry was a music fan
long before he ever became
an executive 
it was why he was so effective
staying out on the road
with the bands 
he was also my cousin 
and all great business
is family 
buck had been a short order
cook before he married nancy 
our pr man 
he was the connection guy
who could convince
just about anyone
to do just about anything 
and nancy 
god  every dj
and radio program director
just loved nance 
she was our secret weapon 
getting our music on the air
and into your lives 
she was also my wife s sister 
beth was  um   
well  she was the first person
who ever believed
my dreams could be
more than just dreams 
she was the first one
to ever truly believe in me 
and joyce   
you know  i may have met her
as kiss s manager  but   
well  we ll get to joyce 
just    give me a little time 
look  i know that we ve been
blamed for a lot of bad things
that happened 
and i m not saying
it s not sex  drugs  and rock
and roll  because it was 
it s just  it was sex before
it was deadly  you know 
and finding out who wasn t
doing drugs would be
a hell of a lot harder story
for you to tell 
but if what you re after
is the truth
of not just what happened
but how it happened 
then  you know  you re
just gonna have to believe
all of it  because every
single bit of it
was true 
even the parts that weren t 
  everybody everywhere  
los angeles 
february 18  1974 
there s a hell of a lot
that comes before that night 
but the story you want
to hear 
well  this is
where it all really begins 
having moved out to california
only two months before 
we were throwing
the biggest party los angeles
had ever thrown 
to launch casablanca records 
the biggest
independent record label
anyone had ever launched 
absolutely i am  hit me 
and we only had one
band to do it with 
and they were    well 
they were  uh  different 
i think this was a mistake 
we should not let them go
on tonight 
 bill  it s gonna be great 
 yeah  for who  him or us 
are you really gonna
put those guys up there
wearing those stupid costumes
and that stupid makeup 
it s who they are  joe 
nobody knows who they are yet 
you know  i got friends
at warner brothers 
and people are talking 
and they re not talking
the way you want to hear 
you know what they re
not talking about  joey  huh 
shit that doesn t scare them 
 nelly  we re ready 
 yeah  or excite them 
or make  em want to dance
or laugh or fuck or cry
or fucking matter at all 
thank you  because the fact
that people are talking 
that s music to my ears 
and you really spent all
the three million dollars
warners gave you as
an advance 
actually 
i spent four million 
show time  neil 
ooh  sounds like they re
playing my song 
yeah  well  just remember 
the house always wins 
even against you 
 you wanna bet 
 i bet they suck 
uh huh 
mwah 
hello  so  i had a thought   
on my way
over here tonight 
i thought to myself 
 what the hell am i doing
in humphrey bogart s
actual suit  
poor kid
from the brooklyn projects 
son of a postman 
oh  stand up  pops  pops 
 there he is 
 thank you  thank you 
 oh  sure  take a bow  why not 
 learned everything from me 
bad stuff from his mother 
hell of a long trip
from brooklyn  huh 
not so far  kid 
dreams   
only come true for those who
believe in them 
so  tonight 
to celebrate the launch
of the biggest independent
record label in history 
we thought we d share
some of our dreams with you 
so  you may have heard them
on the radio 
but after what you re
about to experience tonight 
you re never gonna forget
these guys 
so  put your two lips together
for the hottest band
in the world  kiss

you bet i did 
prettiest girl
in all the world 
i had worked my whole life
leading up to that night 
but kiss was dead the moment
they took that stage 
the town just hated them 
about the time
i got home to beth 
even she had heard
what a disaster it had been 
from the day i married her 
she always knew
the truth i was hiding 
she just   
didn t always admit it 
hey  you okay 
your sister tell you
what happened tonight 
yeah 
even with everything
that had happened
along the way 
we d still always been
better together 
they  uh  say the biggest sin
of a record man
is believing in something
because you have to 
not because you do 
but i had believed in kiss 
and i knew
what casablanca could be 
  get yourself together  
but after the party  the town
was already celebrating
the death of casablanca 
hello  casablanca 
not that that was gonna
stop us 
mark parenteau  wabx

to regular rotation
in detroit 
nance  you paid off mark

  ah  yeah 
but they re giorgio  you know

if you know where to find it 
listen  those new songs of yours
were different 
the eighth
and the sixteenth notes 
that open hi hat
on the down beat 
that s new  it makes you move 
mm hmm 
where did you find that voice 
an american girl 
she does the musicals in munich 
ladonna gaines 
gaines  gaines 
her first husband s name was
sommer 
everything is hotter
in summer 
an italian from germany
writing in english 
you know what 
maybe we pretend she s german 
i never could figure out
his accent 
what  neil  you can t afford
to buy my music 
i may not have been
at your party 
but i could read  even english 
the party was to announce
that we re open for business 
and now  we re on the cover
of everything 
because they say
you re finished 
that s  cause they don t know
what starting looks like 
giorgio  now  i don t want
your music for our label  okay 
i want it for yours 
oasis through casablanca 
you let them write about that 
giorgio  why don t we take
a look at some artwork 
good old flash paper
trick  huh 
oh  nelly  warners wants
to bleed us to death 
i snuck a tape recorder into
their little sales meeting 
they wanna kill kiss
to kill us 
hello  casablanca 
neil  i think
you re overreacting 
oh  really  so you re telling me
that bruce here
did not tell your teams
not to push our records 
bruce  the boys have concerns
about how we re
handling casablanca 
actually  brucie 
the boys here are concerned
that you might be a spineless
little cocksucker 
 oh  yeah  that s also true 
 well  we don t have
any actual proof
about the cock sucking 
but we all know  and no one
here s gonna judge you  bruce 
 fuck you  and fuck you 
 you see that  mo 
he s trying to fuck me 
i don t blame him 
nobody gives a shit
about kiss 
 were you not at the party 
 this ain t got a damn thing
to do about the party  and you
know it 
oh  you re right about that 
it s about the fact that they
can t cut a radio hit 
their bullshit stage tricks
make them a fucking joke 
not an act  that s why
their record s not selling 
i wanna play you
a little something
from our newest record 
you re an asshole  bruce 
mo  just take a listen 
it s got a hell of a hook 
we don t promote kiss
or any casablanca records 
we don t push  em 
they can t sell  em 
and that s how we end  em 
fuckin  bleed  em to death 
  you fucking recorded me 
  don t touch me 
 my wife got me that table 
 he fucking touched me  man 
what the fuck 
this is fucking warner brothers 
not some fucking
new york back alley
you just crawled out of 
assholes 
you messed with our business 
bruce  and nobody 
fucking nobody 
messes with our business 
 not even you  mo 
 what the hell
do you really want 
huh  you didn t come
all the way over here
just to beat up bruce 
 i did 
 no 
we want out 
 from our distribution 
 fucking everything  all of it 
you re broke 
the whole town knows it 
what are you gonna do 
go door to door
across the country 
selling your records yourselves 
you ll never survive without us 
no  we ll never survive
with you 
you re gonna remember
this fucking meeting 
no  and    and not
with a fucking smile 
so  bill me for your table
and have a nice fucking day 
hey  you do know
no one s ever done this before 
because no one s
ever tried before 
launching
our own distribution  we weren t
just going up against warners 
we were waging an all out war
against all the majors at once 
but if we were gonna survive 
we absolutely needed a hit 
which meant we absolutely
needed something new 
ladonna adrian gaines
may have been born in boston 
but her dreams had landed her
in germany 
which is where her story with us
really begins 
 you re late 
 i m as early as i could be

in america 
and i mean right away 
what  we haven t even recorded
the real song yet 
 it s just a demo 
 when i m done with the mix 
no one will care 
i ll care 
uh  you gave him control
over how i look 
he creates an image  a story 
it s what he does 
well  don t you think he should
at least meet the real me
before he decides there needs
to be a fake one created 
ladonna  your daughter
is asleep in the hallway
instead of a bedroom
all her own  dreaming
a sweeter dream than you
could ever provide her alone

right through the fucking gut 
you re a dangerous man 
ain t you 
no  man  i m just the guy
who knows that you are 
and you fucking should be 
but knockout punches 
they gotta come clean 
be relentless 
and never stop until the body
hits the fucking floor 
now  that s a hit 
motherfucker 
 hey 
 what s up 
what s going on  brother

  oh  
ron wasn t completely wrong
about us and the djs 
now  you may have heard of this
as something called payola

mm  it was just another day
at the office 
  you need love now
just as bad as i do  
  oh makes no difference now  
  who you give your thing to  
  oh it s your thing  
frankie crocker was
one of the most influential djs
in the business 
which is saying a lot 
since he was
one of the only black djs
white audiences ever accepted 
  said it s your thing girl  
  oh  
  said it s your thing girl  
  oh baby  
the thing no one ever really got
about payola
is that we never paid anyone
to play records
they didn t wanna play 
 whoo 
 ron  you got
my damn table pregnant 
but did we spread
a little love to get our records
a little more attention 
what do you think 
the records were spinning
as fast as we were 
the hits just kept coming 
there was nothing
that could stop us 
they bought the company 
these fucking guys 
viewlex  they make
film projector lenses 
which means they know
absolutely fucking nothing
about the music business 
  one toke over the line

you lost us an aerosmith tour 
the tour was already lost  gene 
aerosmith doesn t want you
anywhere near them  alright 
no headliner does 
your   
your show
scares the hell out of everyone 
so you want us
to scale everything down 
  cut the pyro and the lights 
  no  no  no  no 
if you re gonna be a headliner 
we re gonna need to make
everything all that much bigger 
alright 
that means more explosions
and so much  so much louder 
i have this guy  alright 
he s got these risers that   
you really think that more fire
and some forklifts
are gonna be
what finally breaks us through 
no 
no  it is gonna be
the music 
and it was always gonna be
the music  but we might
just make enough noise
to    to get enough people
to actually listen to it 
to pay attention 
why did you sign us 
our demo was good  not great 
even i can admit that 
you had to know
how hard this was gonna be 
why take the risk 
because your real name
is chaim witz 
and you moved here from israel
when you were eight years old 
speaking nothing but yiddish 
because paul s real name
is stanley eisen 
because two kids from queens
had dreams about being
the next gods of rock 
and little neil bogatz
from the brooklyn projects
thinks he can make
everybody s dreams come true   
if he s just given
a little more time 
you know  your demo
really was that great  gene 
yeah  raw and honest
rock and roll 
even without all the costumes 
but i tell you
what your real brilliance is 
and i don t even think
you know this 
it s that you write
every single one of your songs
with the same four
god damn chords 
that means that any   
any 14 year old kid
can go out there
and buy a guitar 
and within 20 minutes 
they can be you 
and that matters  gene 
that is who you are 
now  why did you sign
with me  huh 
brand new label
with you as our only act 
you had to know you were taking
as much of a risk as we were 
because you
never should have gotten
out of the brooklyn projects 
and yet  here you are 
here we are 
two imposters 
only if we re wrong 
i get that you like to gamble 
but what if joey was right 
in the end  what if the house
does always win 
well  then we raise the stakes
so high
that we become the house 
two hundred grand more 
you re still upside down
the last hundred 
why don t you make it
a personal loan  then 
don t do this 
you go upside down this big 
it don t matter
how much i fucking love you 
hey  you ever gambled
yourself  joey 
that thumping in your chest
right before that dealer
turns over your next card 
anything is possible
right before that moment 
neil  i m telling you 
i m not gonna be here for you
this time if you don t pay off 
are you gonna give me
the money or not 
no 
 two hundred 
 two hundred 
i know it s bad 
i just wish you would be honest
and tell me how bad 
it s    it s    it s fine 
no  it s not fine
we re not fine 
none of this is fine  neil 
we were fine when we were
on the floor of our home
in new jersey  when i was
teaching you even how to read
those books 
and now  we are broke 
and you are giving
the guys bonuses 
hey  no  did you sister tell you
that buck was the only one
that took it 
maybe he was the only one
smart enough to 
hey  hey 
come on 
just dance with me 
oh 
you stopped dreaming again 
you did 
you know what i dream of 
it s that you re actually here
with us  neil 
and not in new york or las vegas
or wherever else
you disappear to
when you re too afraid
i ll see the truth 
what do you think the truth is 
beth  i love you  come on 
i m always with you 
i m always with you 
you  the kids 
you re all i think about 
you have to know she s going
to end up just as hurt as me 
i convinced myself for so long
that it was okay
when i knew that you were
sharing your bed  neil 
but you are sharing your heart 
tell me i m wrong 
it s complicated 
no 
it s not 
it s really simple

of thing going down

  there s a whole lot of rhythm
going round  
you want
a little bit more or you good

kept bleeding 
that s really beautiful 
i love that 
thanks 
they ve been making fun of me 
they don t think

guys  uh  give us five 
 it s a bullshit trick 
 bill 
okay  it s a mirage 
and it sure as hell
isn t rock and roll  and   
and   
and i wish any of that
mattered right now 
but it just doesn t 
nobody s buying our records 
no one s coming to see us play 
and if an empty speaker cabinet
tricks people into thinking
that we sound better
because we sound louder   
if this is what it finally takes
so that everybody else
feels the way we do   
what i think is 
we do what we have to
to survive 
it s just another part
of the show 
like the costumes 
the    the make up 
no 
it s not 
it s a lie 
about the music 
we ve never lied
about the music 
hey  uh

when you begged me
to convince neil to sign us
even though warner brothers
begged him not to

you were all just fine asking me
to roll over on my pillow
and talk to the president
of your record company then

it s nothing personal 
of course it is 
and you fucking know it 
it s okay 
and now  ladies
and gentlemen 
here s johnny 
here he is  lenny bruce 
maybe you should slow down
a little 
maybe you should speed up
a lot 
hey  i love lenny bruce 
did you know that he was 40
when he died 
you think it was worth it 
dying so young
but then having
all that success 
no  i think dying old
and having all that success
would be worth it 
you promised our distributors
a sure thing
so they ll keep letting us ride
on everything else 
well  it s johnny carson 
it is a sure thing 
besides  a bet is only a bet
if it matters 
it s a wedding night 
and you re both virgins 
it s disgusting 
abe  abe   
you don t mean that 
no  because it s me  abe 
because you ve always trusted  
 talk to me 
 they re not waiting for carson 
 what 
 they re returning
all the unsold kiss albums
and donna and parliament 
 everything 
 that s
 too many fucking records  man 
 no shit  buck 
 what do we do 
 we take  em back 
but you tell
every single fucking one of them
if they do 
they don t get carson 
neil  neil 
what 
what if we re wrong
about carson 
i mean 
we re shipping gold  more 
over 750 000 copies already 
and with the money
we re spending
on    on commercials
and    and print ads   
 it s johnny fucking carson 
 and nobody understands
why the hell
we re even doing it 
then ship more 
spend more  do you job
and make them understand 
this is gonna be
the biggest fucking album
of the year  okay  folks 
you ve lost your mind 
did you not hear
what they said on the phone 
and they re on our fucking side 
 nobody is on our fucking side 
 because nobody understands
what the fuck
you re doing anymore 
not even me 
we were wrong
about kiss  neil 
and we were wrong about donna 
even george
and his fucking spaceship 
we were just wrong 
and here we are  still betting
money we don t even have
on them 
i can t even pay my   
if we re wrong about carson   
we are not fucking wrong  cec 
not about any of them 
we just haven t figured out
a way to finally be right 
 what the hell s happening 
i dared question the postman s
son from brooklyn 
and he didn t like
what he heard 
oh  is that right  cec 
is that the same postman s son
been carrying your ass
from nowhere to somewhere
your whole fucking career 
 excuse me 
 tell me this 
did you believe
we would make it this far 
now  be honest 
do you believe that we could
actually go further 
so  you do your fucking job 
and i will go get
the fucking money 
uh   
he didn t mean that 
cec  shit 
and now  ladies and gentlemen 
here s johnny 
the carson album s
still considered
one of the biggest disasters
ever conceived
in the record business 
the joke was that we d shipped
gold but returned platinum 
just    wasn t a joke 
we d given away
so many promo copies
that when the stores started
returning them to get
their money back  we were
on the line for every last one 
and it was killing us 
killing us  because i was wrong 
biggest sin of a record man   
believing in something
because you have to   
not because you do 
i fucking begged you
to pay back that money  neil 
you kept sayin  
 waiting for carson  
and i convinced them to wait 
because this is me and you 
but they re done waiting 
i m sorry 
it s okay  joe  just tell them
not the arm
i sign contracts with 
i remembered my dad 
remembered my promise
to never become
anything like him 
i just    can t remember
the exact moment when i did 
egg cream 
just get us
the fucking money  neil 
i fucking hate la 
  jesus 
  neil 
jesus 
it s not that he was a postman 
it s just   
i knew that he knew
that s all he was ever gonna be 
 here 
 i m scared 
 come on  shh 
 i m scared 
shh  just our little secret 
brother 
can we get something
to clean him up 
 you want a cigarette 
 you re alright 
it s okay 
okay  come on 
get him up  walk it off 
walk it off 
oh  fuck 
 come on 
 fuck 
if we can t sell enough kiss
records on our own 
then folks 
we are gonna need an army 
 it s merchandise  nelly 
 it s a movement  nance 
i love kiss  but how the fuck
are we gonna get people
to buy shit about the album
and we can t even get them
to buy the fucking album 
because kiss has always been
about the experience 
buck  and that is where
we have failed 
if you re not in
the kiss army  oh 
then you are not
in the kiss army 
you don t get
the limited edition posters 
the signed t shirts 
the comic books 
 so we have comic books now 
 yes  created specifically
for the kiss army 
and the only way to get
into the kiss army   
  is to buy their albums 
  thank you 
now  we have one very important
question to answer 
what color do we paint
the building 
hundred bucks to whoever gets
the    the best color 
okay  can we just  um   
can we just get a minute 
thank you  thank you so much 
what about black 
can you imagine
the whole fucking block
was painted fucking black 
 no  i can t 
 oh 
neil  you are my brother 
and if you want me to go
off this cliff with you 
i ll even be the first to jump 
but you have got to help me
understand why 
 we are broke 
 yes  yes  that is exactly
what all of these fuckers
are saying 
so  by tomorrow 
i want an entire crew   
no  two crews outside 
painting the entire block 
and i want you to pay them extra
to do it slowly 
the longer
they re out there working  oh 
the longer people are just
gonna drive by and see  em 
 see  em doing what 
 painting the building 
we re gonna place one
final bet 
on who 
on us 
it started with a makeover
of the building 
but to the town  we were
building our own makeover 
i mean  every day 
we d announce a new promotion 
but in real life  we were
just swapping titles around
like the paint colors
of the building 
we called everyone we owed 
hyped every plan we had 
making most of it up
as we went along 
 we made them root for us   
 mo 
   not against us 
where the fuck
is all the money coming from 
nowhere  there was none 
we    we just made everyone
believe there was 
we bet everything we had
on everyone
we already believed in 
  she s a stone cold stunner  
we d gone as far as we could go
as fast as we could go 
it s just we were now
seven million dollars in debt 
well    until that night 
  she s a stone cold stunner  
  with a body too  
  so watch out

you made pornography 
well  to afford
my wife s engagement ring

because i failed to get them to 
so  then why are you here 
giorgio told me
that he wanted me to cut
the same song again 
 i don t understand 
 you don t have to  okay 
you just have to trust
that i do 
i don t even know you 
but i know you 
ladonna    adrian    gaines 
grew up singing in a choir 
raised by your mom in boston 
you heard your voice
raising all the way up
to the top
of those stained glass windows 
and you let yourself believe

motherfucker 
sixteen minutes and 50 seconds 
with the record
glued to the turntable 
it played all night long
with frankie still locked
in the bathroom 
lawyers were calling
even before we landed
back in la 
swearing they d never play
a casablanca record again 
except    something happened 
something that never had before 
not just in new york 
stations all across the country
are calling  everybody s trying
to find a way to play her 
 tell them i ll buy them all 
 buy what all 
 the whole half hour block 
 on every station 
 every city 
 the ad campaign 
tune in at midnight
for a half hour of love 
brought to you by casablanca 
 call giorgio 
 and then 
call everybody else 
  love to love you baby  
  do it to me again and again  
we released our version of
 love to love you  in 1976 
and when we did 
it was like nothing else
there ever was 
branded too graphic
by some critics 
it was even banned
by some stations 
which only helps us
to sell more records 
  oh love to love you baby  
time magazine reported
22 simulated orgasms
in the song  and the more people
talked about it 
the more they wanted more 
i mean  we were riding
the biggest single we ever had
with the biggest artist
we ever had 
and we were literally making her
up as we went along 
  oh love to love you babe  
is this make believe  mama 
no  sweetheart  this is real 
i need makeup in here 
we brought in everything   
designers  hair  make up 
in the end  we went with wigs 
in every picture
you ve ever seen 
we invented every detail 
but the truth
was that the first lady of love 
the superstar
we were selling her as 
was as far
from who donna really was
as she could be 
i want to know this woman 
you raised my vocal
in the song 
your vocal is the song 
  bad girls  
  talking about the sad girls  
  sad girls  
  talking about bad girls  
  yeah  
  see them out on the street
at night  
  picking up
all kinds of strangers  
  if the price is right  
  and you can score
if your pocket s tight  
  plus you want a good time  
  you ask yourself  
  who they are  
  like everybody else  
  they come from near and far  
she s gonna be great  i know it 
i love you 
you got it  donna  nailed it 
ladonna 
so  what happens next 
you do 
  dim all the lights
sweet darling  
   cause tonight
it s all the way  
  turn up the old victrola  
  gonna dance the night away  
  love just don t come easy  
  no it seldom does  
  when you find
the perfect love  
  let it fill you up  
  dim all the lights
sweet darling  
   cause tonight
it s all the way  
  hey baby  
  turn up the old victrola  
  gonna dance the night away  
donna was
every one of our dreams
wrapped up
in a once in a lifetime voice
that didn t just rise up
to those stained glass windows 
she smashed right through them 
now  when people
who remember casablanca
actually remember casablanca 
this is what they remember 
donna on top of the world 
as if this was the moment
that began it all 
  up  
  hey baby  
  dim all the lights
sweet honey  
having spent my entire life
inventing my life 
i d now invented hers 
that voice  the way donna
would just flow inside you 
that came from something
far more inventive than me 
but the first lady of love 
the queen of disco 
that was as much of a fairy tale
as i was 
let s replace gladys with donna 
and suddenly 
for the first time 
it wasn t just breaking one hit 
because once donna broke 
the hits
just never stopped coming 
i knew what else
we d did wrong  too 
recording a live album
of greatest hits
from a band
who doesn t even have one 
 that s new  neil  even for us 
 hey  they ve always had hits 
we just failed to record them
in the way
they needed to be heard 
by recording kiss live 
we finally captured
the experience of kiss live   
which is what we d really been
chasing from the very beginning 
turned out  we d been right
about them  too 
we sold
over nine million records 
every bet we d made 
we were right about all of them 
we just    needed enough time
for all of you
to catch up to us 
what is this 
what are you doing 
oh  my god  al 
welcome home  ma 
nelly  i already have a house 
 yeah  well  this one s bigger 
 love you 
are you nuts 
what are you doing here 
al  look 
we don t need this  come on 
what 
no  no  that is too much 
i can only do all this
because you taught me 
who taught you 
i taught you nothing 
 taught you how to lose 
 no  you taught me how to win 
you taught me
to swing for the trees 
to bet big to win big 
you remember 
you taught me how to dream 
maybe a little bit 
no  maybe a lot 
and you know  maybe you were
just a little unlucky 
right  well  i got your luck 
ah  nah 
you made your own luck 
you re a genius 
you re a fucking jewish genius 
ah  come on 
hey 
you re a good son  bubbeleh 
four color world  pop 
i m in heaven 
jesus christ 
you know what  if you can t
keep the beat 
let s just fucking spell  okay 
that s right  we created
the village people  too 
 ymca  became
one of the all time
biggest selling singles 
more than ten million copies 
though other than the cop 
none of the others even sang 
not on the records 
not at the concerts  not ever 
again  let s go again 
you don t trust me  look it up 
we went from living
on the brink of bankruptcy
to earning five million dollars
in one month 
six the next 
  beth i hear you calling  
i finally even let kiss
release  beth 
on the destroyer album 
it would hurt
every single time i heard it 
but it was the smash
we d been chasing
since it all began 
now  this is a love story 
you re the best fake boyfriend
i ever had 
  just a few more hours  
  and i ll be right home
to you  
  i think i hear them calling  
  oh beth what can i do   
  beth what can i do   
  beth i know you re lonely  
  and i hope
you ll be alright  
   cause me and the boys
will be playing  
  all night  
as for donna 
even with all her success 
i don t really believe
ladonna adrian gaines
ever really became donna summer 
we just made you all think
that she had 
so  truth is  none of us
were still who we d been
when it all began 
casablanca had become
something else 
i had become something else 
okay  neil 
what s this all about 
we sold half the company
to polygram 
forty nine percent 
we still keep control 
we ve lived an awful lotta
years pretending to be rich 
you wanna see
what it feels like
when we finally actually are 
nelly 
jesus christ 
um  i m sorry  i m sorry 
i never use the lord s name
in vain  but   
fifty million dollars
for just half the company 
made out to neil bogart 
a name and a life
i d made up along the way 
even paid mo back every penny 
not because i had to 
but because i could 
my dad had been right 
most were all still there
on the same four blocks
of their lives 
for those of you who don t know 
i left casablanca finally
on february 8  1980 
it was a friday 
it was five days
after my 37th birthday 
now  disco had officially died
the year before when a local dj
set a bunch of records on fire
to the roar of a crowd
as if that was
a fucking concert 
yeah  it was a good bet
most of those were ours 
now  all of you remember 
i m sure 
donna and kiss and george 
village people  gladys 
the isleys  bill withers 
all the others 
but i bet each of you  100   
that not one of you
has ever even heard of my name 
and that s okay  it s not like
i had the talent that they did 
because i didn t  you know 
or that i    or that i mattered
like they did 
because  uh    i    i couldn  
but i sure as hell
made you dance 
i sold over
200 million records 
and all that music
that i helped made possible   
became the soundtrack
of your lives 
and we    we were in the
business of making dreams come
true s
didn t we do that 
and if we did 
didn t    didn t that matter 
didn t i 
even if    even if only a song 
i died   
may eighth  just two years
later  from cancer 
i was only 39 years old 
i    i wouldn t change
a fucking thing 
i just wish i had more time 
  i need you

   tonight  
   we just want our story  
  to be told  
you had a lot of resilience 
you have been up and down 
and you ve made a lot of money 
and you ve been
flat on your bum 
  it s nicer being up 
  yes 
if that was the question 
why your resiliency 
where does it come from 
where s that drive come from 
probably  it originally comes
from brooklyn 
  brooklyn 
  you know  all people
that are born in brooklyn seem
to be able to bounce back 
because you have to
if you come from there 
you have to have the desire
to succeed and be a gambler 
and i both have the desire
and am a gambler 
so  you were poor 
  yes 
  mm hmm
i came from brooklyn 
and i used to sing on
the street corners and stuff 
do you think    i mean  what
does it take to be a greaser 
 i mean   
 you got what it takes 
you probably got what it takes 
what do you think is
the biggest misunderstanding
about neil bogart 
there are quite a few
misunderstandings
about neil bogart 
if you feel like rocking
the hollywood bowl 
it feels like being rocked 
how d you get
so down and out  neil 
i came out to california
after having a company
called buddah records
in new york city 
which was very successful 
and i went into partnership
with warners brothers records 
inside of eight months 
the partnership
had just about dissolved 
and i lost the quickest
three million dollars
anybody ever put up
for anybody else 
what does it feel like
to lose
a couple of million dollars 
well  the strange thing is 
i really didn t have it 
you know 
of course 
i don t think if i had it 
i could have taken the risk 
you know 
it was a kind of situation
where i just kept going and
really didn t stop to think
of how i was going
to pay it back 
and fortunately  success
was around the corner 
and i was able to pay it back
and come from behind 
you did it by giving 
first of all 
one of the largest parties
ever given in this town 
 didn t you 
 yes  it was 
he laughs about it 
and you couldn t leave
a tip  right 
at the end  i couldn t 
the party was fabulous 
the reception was fabulous 
the welcome to california
was exciting 
and from there 
everything went downhill 
about eight months later 
i realized that um 
it wasn t going to happen 
i had just finished
probably the most expensive
album ever done
in the record industry 
which was
here s johnny  magic moments
from the tonight show 
  and we opened   
  oh  you did that 
yeah  that was our record 
you all bought that 
didn t you 
yeah 
we over advertised 
and we over promoted 
and we did everything
you could possibly do wrong 
and i went to acapulco 
and while i was there 
scuba diving 
i thought that   you owe
three million dollars 
you don t have any money
left in the bank  
  yeah 
   you might have payroll
for about two
or three weeks left  
and i was down there 
and i took the mouthpiece out
and said   it could be over  
i mean  that could be it 
you don t have to come back
to the problems 
you don t have to come back
to face the failure 
and  um    the last record
i released at buddah records
was a thing
by gladys knight and the pips 
that when la seemed
too much for the man 
he couldn t make it 
so he s leaving
the life he s come to know 
he s leaving on a midnight
train to georgia 
and i just realized
that wasn t me 
i had to win  or i had to fail 
i couldn t cop out 
and i put
the mouthpiece back in 
i swam and found joyce 
i said   come on back 
we re going upstairs 
we re gonna go back 
and we re gonna do it 
we re going to win 
or we re gonna fail  
and in the back of my head 
i always had the thought
that i can always go
back to brooklyn and open
  a candy store 
  yeah 
except there are a lot of those
there  aren t there 
yeah  but you know 
growing up there  i mean 
that was always
a kind of comforting thing
that i could always go
back to that 
and that was a great life 
hi 
what does a tiger say 
that was the bogarts 
the fabulous bogarts 
well  i want to thank you all 
jill  timothy  bradley 
come on  come on 
say goodbye to the audience 
we ll see you again 
 bye 
 bye  everybody 
  bye 
  bye 
do you have one more word you d
like to say to everybody
