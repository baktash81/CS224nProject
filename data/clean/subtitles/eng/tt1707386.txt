 singing 
look down  look down
don t look them in the eye
convicts  look down  look down
you re here until you die
no god above
and hell alone below
convicts  look down  look down
there s 20 years to go
i ve done no wrong
sweet jesus  hear my prayer 
convicts  look down  look down
sweet jesus doesn t care
convict  i know she ll wait
i know that she ll be true
convicts  look down  look down
they ve all forgotten you
when i get free
you won t see me
here for dust 
convicts  huh 
look down  look down
you ll always be a slave
look down  look down
you re standing
in your grave
retrieve the flag 
 grunting 
 thudding 
 singing 
now  prisoner 24601
your time is up
and your parole s begun
you know what that means 
yes  it means i m free
no  follow to the letter
your itinerary
this badge of shame
you ll show it till you die
it warns you re
a dangerous man
i stole a loaf of bread
my sister s child
was close to death
and we were starving
you will starve again
unless you learn
the meaning of the law
i know the meaning
of those 19 years
a slave of the law 
five years for what you did
the rest because
you tried to run
yes  24601
my name is jean valjean 
and i m javert 
do not forget my name
do not forget me
convicts  look down  look down
you ll always be a slave
look down  look down
you re standing
in your grave
 breathing heavily 
 panting 
 singing  freedom at last
how strange the taste
never forget the years 
the waste
nor forgive them
for what they ve done
they are the guilty
everyone
the day begins
and now let s see
what this new world
will do for me
can i help 
a day s work 
overseer  papers 
no work here 
mairie officer  valjean  as a dangerous
man  you will be on parole forever 
failure to report
means immediate arrest 
be in pontarlier in 30 days 
follow him 
 exclaims in annoyance 
 yelling 
innkeeper  let me
see your papers 
monsieur 
papers 
i ll sleep in the stable 
please  i m hungry 
get out 
 groans 
 exhales 
 gasps  hey 
 singing  come in 
sir  for you are weary
and the night is cold
out here
though our lives
are very humble
what we have
we have to share
there is wine
here to revive you
there is bread
to make you strong
there s a bed to
rest till morning
rest from pain
and rest from wrong
bless the food we eat today 
bless our dear sister
and our honored guest 
 sighs 
 clattering 
get in there 
put him down 
stay there 
 groans 
constable  monsignor 
we have your silver 
we caught this man
red handed 
he had the nerve to
say you gave him this 
 singing  that is right
but  my friend 
you left so early
surely something
slipped your mind
you forgot i gave these also
would you leave
the best behind 
messieurs  release him
this man has spoken true
i commend you for your duty
now god s blessing go with you
but remember this  my brother
see in this some higher plan
you must use
this precious silver
to become an honest man
by the witness of the martyrs
by the passion and the blood
god has raised
you out of darkness
i have saved your soul for
god
 singing  what have i done 
sweet jesus  what have i done 
become a thief in the night
become a dog on the run
have i fallen so far
and is the hour so late
that nothing remains
but the cry of my hate 
the cries in the dark
that nobody hears
here where i stand at
the turning of the years
if there s another way to go
i missed it 20 long years ago
my life was a war
that could never be won
they gave me a number
and they murdered valjean
when they chained me
and left me for dead
just for stealing
a mouthful of bread
 breathing heavily 
yet why did i allow this man
to touch my soul
and teach me love 
he treated me like any other
he gave me his trust
he called me brother
my life he claims
for god above
can such things be 
for i had come
to hate the world
this world that
always hated me 
take an eye for an eye 
turn your heart into stone 
this is all i have lived for 
this is all i have known 
one word from him
and i d be back
beneath the lash 
upon the rack
instead he offers me
my freedom 
i feel my shame inside me
like a knife
he told me that i have a soul
how does he know 
what spirit comes
to move my life 
 weeping 
is there another way to go 
i am reaching but i fall
and the night is closing in
as i stare into the void
to the whirlpool of my sin
i ll escape now
from that world
from the world of jean valjean
jean valjean is nothing now 
another story must begin 
 dramatic music playing 
beggars  chorus   singing  at the end
of the day you re another day older
and that s all you can say
for the life of the poor
it s a struggle  it s a war 
and there s nothing
that anyone s giving
one more day standing about
what is it for 
one day less to be living
at the end of the day
you re another day colder
and the shirt on your back
doesn t keep out the chill
and the righteous hurry past they
don t hear the little ones crying
and the plague is coming
on fast ready to kill
one day nearer to dying 
at the end of the day
there s another day dawning
and the sun in the morning
is waiting to rise
like the waves
crash on the sand
like a storm
that ll break any second
there s a hunger in the land there s
a reckoning still to be reckoned
and there s gonna be hell to
pay at the end of the day 
 factory women  assume 
 shushing 
at the end of the day
you get nothing for nothing
sitting flat on your bum
doesn t buy any bread
there are children
back at home
and the children
have got to be fed
and you re lucky
to be in a job
and in a bed
 gasps 
and we re counting
our blessings
have you seen how the
foreman is fuming today
with his terrible breath
and his wandering hands 
it s because little fantine
won t give him his way
take a look at his trousers
you ll see where he stands 
 all giggling 
and the boss  he never knows that
the foreman is always on heat
if fantine doesn t look out 
watch how she goes
she ll be
out on the street
factory women  at the end of
the day it s another day over
with enough in your pocket
to last for a week
pay the landlord  pay the shop keep
on working as long as you re able
keep on working till you drop or it s
back to the crumbs off the table
well  you ve got to pay your
way at the end of the day 
and what have we here

 singing  at the end of the day
she s the one who began it 
there s a kid that she s
hiding in some little town

you can guess how
she picks up the extra
you can bet she s earning
her keep sleeping around 
and the boss
wouldn t like it
yes  it s true there s a child
and the child is my daughter
and her father abandoned
us  leaving us flat

innkeeper man and his wife

while we re earning
our daily bread

her hands in the butter

all going to end in the gutter
and it s us who ll have to pay
at the end of the day

doubt of any trouble hereabout

love to one already dead 
 man exhales 
 coins clinking 
there was a time
when men were kind
when their voices were soft
and their words inviting
there was a time
when love was blind
and the world was a song
and the song was exciting
there was a time
then it all went wrong
i dreamed a dream
in time gone by
when hope was high
and life worth living
i dreamed that
love would never die
i dreamed that god
would be forgiving
then i was young and unafraid
and dreams were made
and used and wasted
there was no ransom to be paid
no song unsung 
no wine untasted
but the tigers come at night
with their voices
soft as thunder
as they tear your hope apart
as they turn
your dream to shame
he slept a summer by my side
he filled my days
with endless wonder
he took my childhood
in his stride
but he was gone
when autumn came
 sobbing 
and still i dream
he ll come to me
that we will live
the years together
but there are dreams
that cannot be
and there are storms
we cannot weather
 sobbing 
i had a dream my life would be
so different from
this hell i m living
so different now
from what it seemed 
now
life has killed the dream
i dreamed
have you anywhere to go 
no  you need to get warm 
 fantine coughing 
bamatabois 
what do you have for me 
pimp  here s

i guarantee
i ll make you suffer
i beg you 
don t report me  sir
i ll do whatever
you may want
make your excuse to the police
tell me quickly
what s the story
who saw what
and why and where 
let him give a full description
let him answer to javert
javert  would you believe it 
i was lost here in the dark
when this prostitute attacked me
you can see she left her mark
she will answer for her actions
if you make a full report
you may rest assured  monsieur
she will answer to the court
there s a child
who sorely needs me
please  monsieur 
she s but that high
holy god  is there no mercy 
if i go to jail she ll die
i have heard such protestations
every day for 20 years
let s have
no more explanations
save your breath 
save your tears
honest work  just reward
that s the way
to please the lord
a moment of your time  javert
i do believe this woman s tale
monsieur le mayor 
you ve done your duty 
let her be
she needs a doctor 
not a jail
monsieur le mayor 
can this be 
where will she end
this child without a friend 
i ve seen your face before
 shivering 
show me some way to help you
how have you come to grief
in such a place as this 
monsieur 
don t mock me now  i pray
it s hard enough
i ve lost my pride
you let your foreman
send me away
yes  you were there
and turned aside
 spits 
 weeping 
i never did no wrong
is it true what i ve done   
my daughter s close to dying
   to an innocent soul 
if there s a god above   
had i only known then
   he d let me die instead
in his name
my task has just begun
i will take her
to the hospital 
monsieur le mayor 
where is your child 
with an innkeeper
in montfermeil 
i will send for her
immediately 
 singing 
i will see it done 
rest 
from paris  monsieur 
 singing  monsieur le mayor 
i have a crime to declare 
i have disgraced
the uniform that i wear
i ve done you wrong
let no forgiveness be shown
i ve been as hard
on every rogue i have known
i mistook you for a convict
i have made a false report
now i learn they caught the culprit
he s about to face the court
and of course he now denies
it you d expect that of a con
but he couldn t run forever
no  not even jean valjean
you say this man denies it all
and gives no sign of
understanding or repentance 
you say this man
is going to trial
and that he s sure to be
returned to serve his sentence 
he will pay  and so must i
press charges against me  sir
you have only
done your duty
it s a minor sin
at most
all of us have
made misjudgments
you ll return  sir 
to your post
 sighs in relief 
they think that man is me
without a second glance
this stranger they have found
this man could be my chance
why should i save his hide 
why should i right this wrong 
when i have come so far
and struggled for so long 
if i speak  i am condemned
if i stay silent 
i am damned 
i am the master of
hundreds of workers
they all look to me
can i abandon them  how would
they live if i am not free 
if i speak  they are condemned
if i stay silent
i am damned
who am i 
can i condemn
this man to slavery 
pretend i do not
feel his agony 
this innocent
who bears my face
who goes to judgment
in my place
who am i 
can i conceal
myself forevermore 
pretend i m not
the man i was before 
and must my name until i die
be no more than an alibi 
must i lie 
how can i ever
face my fellow men 
how can i ever
face myself again 
my soul belongs to god  i know
i made that bargain long ago
he gave me hope
when hope was gone
he gave me
strength to journey on 
who am i 
who am i 
i m jean valjean
 urges horse 
monsieur le mayan 
 singing  and so 
your honor  you see it s true
this man bears
no more guilt than you 
who am i

magistrate  monsieur le mayor 
you are not well 
you must come with me 
if you don t believe me 
ask inspector javert 
you ll find me
at the hospital 
 audience murmuring 
 singing  cosette 
it s turned so cold
 coughing weakly 
cosette 
it s past your bedtime

cosette  the light is fading
don t you see
the evening star appearing

 valjean shushing 
dear fantine 
cosette will be here soon
dear fantine

 sighs in dismay 
 gasps 
valjean  at last
we see each other plain
 monsieur le mayor 
you ll wear a different chain
before you say
another word  javert
before you chain me up
like a slave again
listen to me 
there is something i must do
this woman leaves
behind a suffering child
there is none but me
who can intercede
in mercy s name 
three days are all i need
then i ll return 
i pledge my word
then i ll return
you must think me mad
i ve hunted you
across the years
men like you
can never change
a man such as you 
believe of me what you will
men like you
can never change
there is a duty
i m sworn to do
men like me
can never change
you know nothing of my life
no  24601 
all i did was steal some bread
my duty is to the law
you know nothing
of the world
you have no rights
you would sooner
see me dead
come with me  24601 
but not before
i see this justice done 
javert  now the wheel
has turned around
jean valjean
means nothing now
dare you talk to me
of crime
i am warning you  javert
and the price
you had to pay
i m the stronger man by far 
every man is born in sin
there is power in me yet 
every man
must choose his way
my race is not yet run 
you know nothing of javert 
i was born inside a jail 
i was born
with scum like you 
i am from the gutter  too

and she s soft to touch
she says   whispering   cosette

cosette 
cosette
dear fantine 
gone to rest
have we done for her
child what is best 
i think so 
shared our bread 
shared each bone
treated her like
she s one of our own
yes  our own 
like our own 
monsieur 
the cost adds up 
your feelings do
you credit  sir
and i will ease
the parting blow
let us not talk of bargains
and bones and greed
now may i say we are agreed 
that would
quite fit the bill
if she hadn t
so often been ill
little dear  cost us dear
medicines are expensive 
monsieur
 both coughing 
not that we begrudged a sou
it s no more than
we christians must do
than we christians may do
no more words 
here s your price
fifteen hundred
for your sacrifice
come  cosette 
say goodbye
let us seek out
some friendlier sky
thank you  both  for cosette
it won t take you
too long to forget
farewell  courgette 
it s  cosette  
cosette 
and  open 
it s for you 
 singing 
where i go  you will be
will you be
like a papa to me 
yes  cosette
this is true
i ll be father
and mother to you
 grunts 
not bad 
not enough 
there s a copper at the door
what the devil have you done 
where s the child cosette 
 singing 
she s gone with a gent
didn t tell us
where they went
didn t leave
his home address
you re a bloody fool
look at what we got
should ve struck the iron
struck it while it s hot 
next time round  i promise
i m gonna get the lot
okay 
 singing 
suddenly you re here
suddenly it starts
can two anxious hearts
beat as one 
yesterday i was alone
today you are beside me
something still unclear
something not yet here
has begun
suddenly the world
seems a different place
somehow full of grace
full of light
how was i to know
that so much hope
was held inside me 
what is passed is gone
now we journey on
through the night
how was i to know at last that
happiness can come so fast 
trusting me the way you do
i m so afraid of failing you
just a child who cannot know
that danger follows where i go
there are shadows everywhere
and memories i cannot share
nevermore alone
nevermore apart
you have warmed my heart
like the sun
you have brought the gift of
life and love so long denied me
suddenly i see
what i could not see
something suddenly
has begun
 sighs contentedly 
halt 
let s see your papers 
where are you traveling 
cosette  cosette 
 shushing 
give me the doll 
come

 nuns singing

monsieur le mayor  
who are you 
fauchelevent 
i fell under my cart 
you saved my ne  monsieur 
fauchelevent 
we need a place of sanctuary 
this child and i 
we need to disappear 
 singing  we ll give thanks
for what is granted
what the sisters may ordain
come 
here we pray
for new beginnings
here our lives
can start again
 singing  there 
out in the darkness
a fugitive running
fallen from god
fallen from grace
god be my witness
i never shall yield
till we come face to face
till we come face to face
he knows his way in the dark
mine is the way of the lord
those who follow
the path of the righteous
shall have their reward
and if they fall
as lucifer fell
the flames  the sword 
stars in your multitudes
scarce to be counted
filling the darkness
with order and light
you are the sentinels
silent and sure
keeping watch in the night
keeping watch in the night
you know your place in the sky
you hold your course
and your aim
and each in your season
returns and returns
and is always the same
and if you fall
as lucifer fell
you fall in flames 
and so it must be 
for so it is written
on the doorway to paradise
that those who falter
and those who fall
must pay the price
lord  let me find him
that i may see him
safe behind bars 
i will never rest till then 
this i swear
this i swear by the stars 
 ominous music playing 
come on  boys 
 boys grunting

cosette 
cosette  papa 
another brawl in the square
another stink in the air
was there a witness to this 
well  let him speak to javert 
monsieur  these streets are not
safe but let these vermin beware
we ll see that
justice is done
look upon
this fine collection
crawled from
underneath a stone
this swarm of
worms and maggots
could have picked you
to the bone
i know this man over here
i know his name and his trade
and on your witness  monsieur 
i ll see him suitably paid
but where s
the gentleman gone 
and why on earth
would he run 
you will have
a job to find him
he s not all he seems to be
and that girl
he trails behind him
ls the child
he stole from me
yeah  and me 
yeah  both of us 
 singing  could it be he s that old
jailbird that the tide now washes in 
heard my name and started running
all the omens point to him
in the absence of a victim
dear inspector  may i go 
and remember
 spits 
when you ve nicked him
it was me what told you so
let the old man
keep on running
i will run him off his feet 
everyone  about your business
clear this garbage off the street
cosette  now i remember
cosette  how can it be 
we were children together
look what s become of me
eponine  who was that girl 
that bourgeois
two a penny thing
eponine  find her for me

but careful how you go

eponine  i m lost
until she s found
you see  i told you so
there s lots of things
i know
 laughing 
 ponine
she knows her way around
 singing 
the time is near
so near it s stirring
the blood in their veins
and yet beware 
don t let the wine
go to your brains
we need a sign to
rally the people
to call them to arms
and to bring them in line 
marius  wake up 
what s wrong today 
you look as if
you ve seen a ghost
some wine  and
say what s going on
a ghost  you say 
a ghost maybe
she was just
like a ghost to me
one minute there 
then she was gone
i am agog 
i am aghast 
is marius in love
at last 
i ve never heard
him  ooh  and  aah 
you talk of
battles to be won
and here he comes
like don juan
it is better
than an opera 
 laughing 
it is time for us all
to decide who we are
do we fight for the right
to a night at the opera now 
have you asked of yourself
what s the price you might pay 
is this simply a game
for a rich young boy to play 
the colors of the world
are changing day by day
red  the blood of angry men 
black  the dark of ages past 
red  a world about to dawn 
black 
the night that ends at last 
had you seen her today
you might know how it feels
to be struck to the bone in a
moment of breathless delight 
had you been there today
you might also have known
how your world may be changed
in just one burst of light
and what was right seems wrong
and what was wrong seems right
red 
i feel my soul on fire 
black 
my world if she s not there 
all  red 
the color of desire 
all  black 
the color of despair 
marius 
you re no longer a child
i do not doubt
you mean it well
but now
there is a higher call
i know 
who cares about
your lonely soul 
we strive
towards a larger goal
our little lives
don t count at all 
red 
all   the blood of angry men 
black 
the dark of ages past 
red 
a world about to dawn 
black 
the night that ends at last 
listen  everybody 
general lamarque
is dead 
 singing  lamarque  his
death is the hour of fate
the people s man
his death is
the sign we await 
on his funeral day
they will honor his name
with the light of
rebellion ablaze in their eyes
from their candles of grief
we will kindle our flame
on the tomb of lamarque
shall our barricade rise 
the time is here 
let us welcome it gladly
with courage and cheer 
let us take to the streets
with no doubt in our hearts
but a jubilant shout 
they will come one and all 
all  they will come
when we call 
 students chattering
indistinctly 
did you find her 
 singing 
how strange
this feeling that
my life s begun at last
this change
can people really
fall in love so fast 
what s the matter
with you  cosette 
have you been
too much on your own 
so many things unclear
so many things unknown
in my life
there are so many
questions and answers
that somehow seem wrong
in my life
there are times when
i catch in the silence
the sigh of a faraway song
and it sings
of a world that i long to see
out of reach
just a whisper away
waiting for me
does he know i m alive 
do i know if he s real 
does he see what i see 
does he feel what i feel 
in my life
i m no longer alone
now the love in
my life is so near
find me now
find me here
dear cosette
you re such a lonely child
how pensive 
how sad you seem to me
believe me 
were it within my power
i d fill each passing hour
how quiet it must be 
i can see
with only me for company
there s so little i know
that i m longing to know
of the man that you were
in a time long ago
please  cosette 
there s so little you say
of the life you have known
why you keep to yourself
why you re always alone
so dark
so dark and deep
the secrets that you keep
in my life
please forgive what i say you
are loving and gentle and good
but papa  dear papa
in your eyes i am still like that
child who was lost in a wood
no more words
no more words
it s a time that is dead
there are words
that are better unheard
better unsaid
in my life
i m no longer a child and i yearn
for the truth that you know
of the years  years ago
you will learn
truth is given by god
to us all in our time
in our turn
in my life
she has burst like the music
of angels the light of the sun
and my life seems to stop
as if something is over
and something
has scarcely begun 
eponine  you re the friend
who has brought me here
thanks to you
i m at one with the gods
and heaven is near 
and i soar through a world
that is new that is free
every word that he says
is a dagger in me
in my life
there s been no one
like him anywhere
anywhere  where he is
if he asked  i d be his
both   in my life
there is someone
who touches my life
waiting near
waiting here
a heart full of love
a heart full of song
i m doing everything
all wrong
oh god  for shame
i do not even know your name
dear mademoiselle
 won t you 88   
will you tell 
a heart full of love
no fear  no regret
my name is marius pontmercy
and mine s cosette
cosette 
i don t know what to say
then make no sound
i am lost
i am found
a heart full of love
he was never mine to lose
both   a heart full of you
a single look
and then i knew
why regret
what could not be 
i knew it  too
these are words
he ll never say
not to me
from today
not to me
not for me
every day
his heart full of love
both  for it isn t a dream
he will never feel this way
both  not a dream after all
valjean  cosette  
cosette

 sighs 
 singing

please  papa  we can t 
hurry  cosette 
it s time to close another
door and live another day 
get dressed 
we re leaving  now 
please  no 
 raindrops pattering 
 singing  on my own
pretending he s beside me
all alone
i walk with him till morning
without him
i feel his arms around me
and when i lose my way
i close my eyes
and he has found me
in the rain
the pavement
shines like silver
all the lights
are misty in the river
in the darkness the trees
are full of starlight
and all i see is him and me
forever and forever
and i know
it s only in my mind
that i m talking to myself
and not to him
and although
i know that he is blind
still i say
there s a way for us
i love him
but when the night is over
he is gone 
the river s just a river
without him
the world around me changes
the trees are bare
and everywhere
the streets are
full of strangers
i love him
but every day i m learning
all my life
i ve only been pretending
without me 
his world will go on turning
a world that s
full of happiness
that i have never known
 sobs 
i love him
i love him
i love him
but only on my own
 singing 
one day more
another day 
another destiny
this never ending
road to calvary
these men who seem to know my crime
will surely come a second time
one day more
i did not live until today
how can i live
when we are parted 
one day more
both  tomorrow
you ll be worlds away
and yet with you
my world has started
one more day all on my own
both  will we ever meet again 
one more day
with him not caring
both  i was born
to be with you
what a life
i might have known
both  and i swear
i will be true
but he never saw me there
one more day
before the storm
do i follow
where she goes 
at the barricades
of freedom 
shall i join
my brothers there 
when our ranks
begin to form
do i stay and do i dare 
will you take
your place with me 
 all   the time is now 
the day is here 
one day more 
one day more to revolution
we will nip it in the bud
we ll be ready
for these schoolboys
they will wet themselves
with blood 
one day more 
watch  em run amuck
catch  em as they fall
both  never know your luck
when there s a free for all
here s a little dip
there a little touch
both  most of them are goners
so they won t miss much 
all  one day
to a new beginning
raise the flag
of freedom high 
every man will be a king 
every man will be a king 
there s a new world
for the winning 
there s a new world to be won
do you hear the people sing 
my place is here 
i fight with you 
one day more 
we will join
these people s heroes
we will follow
where they go
one more day all on my own
we will learn
their little secrets
we will know
the things they know
one day more 
both  tomorrow
you ll be worlds away
one more day
to revolution
what a life
i might have known
javert  we will nip it
in the bud
both  and yet with you
my world has started
we ll be ready
for these schoolboys
tomorrow
will be far away
all  tomorrow
is the judgment day
tomorrow we ll discover
what our god in heaven
has in store
one more dawn 
one more day 
one day more

how soon they fly
on and on
and i am old
and will be gone
bring him peace

he is young
he is only a boy
you can take
you can give
let him be

enjolras

dead bodies there  dry ammunition 
feuilly  the gunpowder

 students shouting

army officer  steady  lads 
enjolras  go 
courfeyrac  they re coming 
 students shouting
in distance 
 screaming 
 glass shattering 
 panting 
 grunts 
 groaning 
 grunting 
 exclaims in distress 
thank you 
long live the revolution 
here s a pretty ring 
oh 
hello 
 yelps 
you re alive  i saved you 
you 
 panting 
how do i get out of here 
it s that way 
all the way down
and to the left 
 groaning 
 grunts 
 sighs in relief 
 panting 
 singing  it s you  javert i
knew you wouldn t wait too long
the faithful servant
at his post once more
this man s done no wrong
he needs a doctor s care
i warned you i would not give in 
i won t be swayed 
another hour yet
then i m yours
all our debts are paid
the man of mercy comes again
and talks of justice 
come  time is running short 
look down  javert
he s standing in his grave 
one more step
and you die 
 singing  who is this man 
what sort of devil is he 
to have me caught in a trap
and choose to let me go free 
it was his hour at last
to put a seal on my fate
wipe out the past and wash
me clean off the slate
all it would take was
a flick of his knife
vengeance was his
and he gave me back my life 
damned if i live in
the debt of a thief 
damned if i yield at
the end of the chase 
i am the law and
the law is not mocked 
i ll spit his pity
right back in his face 
there is nothing on earth
that we share 
it is either
valjean or javert 
and my thoughts fly apart
can this man be believed 
shall his sins be forgiven 
shall his crimes be reprieved 
and must i now begin to doubt
who never doubted
all these years 
my heart is stone
and still it trembles
the world i have known
is lost in shadow
is he from heaven
or from hell 
and does he know
that granting me my life today
this man has
killed me even so 
i am reaching but i fall
and the stars
are black and cold
as i stare into the void
of a world that cannot hold
i ll escape now
from that world
from the world of jean valjean
there is nowhere i can turn
there is no way to go on
turning woman 1   singing  did
you see them going off to fight 
turning woman 2  children of the
barricade who didn t last the night
did you see them
lying where they died 
someone used to cradle them
and kiss them when they cried
did you see them
lying side by side 
 singing  there s a grief
that can t be spoken
there s a pain goes on and on
empty chairs at empty tables
now my friends
are dead and gone
here they talked of revolution
here it was they lit the flame
here they sang about tomorrow
and tomorrow never came
from the table in the corner
they could see a world reborn
and they rose
with voices ringing
and i can hear them now
the very words
that they have sung
became their last communion
on this lonely barricade
at dawn
oh  my friends 
my friends  forgive me
that i live and you are gone
there s a grief
that can t be spoken
there s a pain goes on and on
phantom faces at the windows
phantom shadows on the floor
empty chairs at empty tables
where my friends
will meet no more
oh  my friends  my friends
don t ask me
what your sacrifice was for
empty chairs at empty tables
where my friends will sing
no more
 singing  every day you walk
with stronger step
you walk with longer step
the worst is over
don t think about it 
marius 
with all the years
ahead of us 
i will never go away
and we will be
together every day
every day
we ll remember that night
and the vow that we made
a heart full of love
she was never mine to keep
a night full of you
she is youthful  she is free
cosette  the words are old
but always true
cosette  cosette 
love is
the garden of the young
cosette  i saw you waiting
and i knew
thank god you are here
waiting for you
let it be
at your feet
thank god you are home
let it be
valjean   a heart full of love
both  and it wasn t a dream
this i give you this day
both  not a dream after all
monsieur  this is a day
i never can forget
ls gratitude enough
for giving me cosette 
your home shall be with us
and not a day shall pass
but we will prove our love
to you  whom we shall call
a father to us both
a father to us all
not another word  my son
there s something now
that must be done
there lived a man
whose name was jean valjean
he stole some bread to
save his sister s son
for 19 winters
he served his time
in sweat
he washed away his crime
years ago
he broke parole and
lived a life apart
how could he tell cosette
and break her heart 
marius   
it s for cosette
this must be faced
if he is caught 
she is disgraced
the time has come
to journey on
and from this day
he must be gone
who am i 
who am i 
you re jean valjean
monsieur  you cannot leave
whatever i tell my beloved
cosette she will never believe
tell her i ve gone on a
journey a long way away
tell her my heart was
too full for farewells
it is better this way
promise me  monsieur
cosette will never know
what i have spoken
why i must go
for the sake of cosette
it must be so
thank you  marius 
 singing  where s he gone
without a word 
that wouldn t be
his way to go
why so sudden 
why so strange 
 groaning  oh  did he say
how long he ll be gone 
all he asked for me to say
is he s on a journey far away
he can t leave us now
how he breaks my heart
and we will never be apart
i promise you 
 joyful music playing 
the baron and
baroness du thanard 
 singing 
go away  thenardier 
do you think
i don t know who you are 
he s not fooled
told you so
show monsieur
what you ve come here to show
tell the boy what you know
pity to disturb you
at a feast like this
but 500 francs
surely wouldn t come amiss
in god s name 
say what you have to say
he speaks
you pay 
what i saw  clear as light
jean valjean in
the sewers one night
had this corpse on his back
some boy he had killed
in a vicious attack
i was there  never fear
i even found me
this fine souvenir
i know this
this is mine
this is surely
some heavenly sign
then it s true
then i m right
jean valjean was
my savior that night
jean valjean  the old con
you pay up
or i ll say where he s gone
where is he 
where is he 
the convent 
cosette  come with me 
come with me 
both   singing  watch the buggers
dance watch  em till they drop 
keep your wits about you
and you ll stand on top 
masters of the land
always get our share
clear away the barricades
and we re still there
we know where
the wind is blowing
money is the stuff we smell
and when we re rich
as croesus
jesus  won t
we see you all in hell 
how dare you 
 singing 
alone i wait in the shadows
i count the hours
until i sleep
i dreamed a dream
cosette stood by
it made her weep
to know i die
alone at the end of the day
upon this wedding night
i pray
take these children  my lord 
to thy embrace
and show them grace
god on high
hear my prayer
take me now
to thy care
where you are
let me be
take me now
take me there
bring me home
 sighs 
bring me home
 groans 
fantine  monsieur 
i bless your name
i am ready  fantine
monsieur 
lay down your burden
at the end of my days
you raised my child in love
she s the best of my life
and you will be with god
oh 
oh   
 softly  fantine 
 singing  papa  papa 
i do not understand
are you all right 
why did you go away 
 exclaims in relief 
cosette  my child 
am i forgiven now 
thank god  thank god
i ve lived to see this day 
it s you who must forgive
a thoughtless fool
it s you who must
forgive a thankless man
it s thanks to you
that i am living
and again i lay down
my life at your feet
cosette 
your father is a saint
when they wounded me
he took me from the barricade
carried like a babe
and brought me home to you
now you are here
again beside me
now i can die in peace
for now my life is blessed
you will live  papa
you re going to live
it s too soon
too soon to say goodbye
yes  cosette 
forbid me now to die 
i ll obey
i will try
on this page
i write my last confession
read it well
when i at last am sleeping
it s the story
of one who turned from hating
a man who only learned to love
when you were in his keeping
i know it  papa 
come with me
where chains
will never bind you
i am ready  fantine 
all your grief
at last  at last behind you
lord in heaven
look down on him in mercy
forgive me all my trespasses
and take me to your glory
fantine  take my hand
i ll lead you to salvation
take my love
for love is everlasting
 all   and remember
the truth that once was spoken
to love another person
is to see the face of god
crowd  do you hear the people sing
lost in the valley of the night 
it is the music of a people
who are climbing to the light
for the wretched of the earth
there is a flame
that never dies
even the darkest night will
end and the sun will rise
we will live again in freedom
in the garden of the lord
we will walk behind the plowshare
we will put away the sword
the chain will be broken and all
men will have their reward 
will you join
in our crusade 
who will be strong
and stand with me 
somewhere beyond
the barricade
ls there a world
you long to see 
do you hear the people sing 
say  do you hear
the distant drums 
it is the future that we bring
when tomorrow comes 
will you join
in our crusade 
who will be strong
and stand with me 
somewhere beyond
the barricade
ls there a world
you long to see 
do you hear the people sing 
say  do you hear
the distant drums
