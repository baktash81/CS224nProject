grunting

singing

your time is up
and your paroles begun
you know what that means
yes it means im free
no follow to the letter
your itinerary
this badge of shame
youll show it till you die
it warns youre
a dangerous man
i stole a loaf of bread
my sisters child
was close to death
and we were starving
you will starve again
unless you learn
the meaning of the law
i know the meaning
of those 19 years
a slave of the law
five years for what you did
the rest because
you tried to run
yes 24601
my name is jean valjean
and im javert
do not forget my name
do not forget me
convicts look down look down
youll always be a slave
look down look down
youre standing
in your grave
breathing heavily
panting
singing freedom at last
how strange the taste
never forget the years
the waste
nor forgive them
for what theyve done
they are the guilty
everyone
the day begins
and now lets see
what this new world
will do for me
can i help
a days work
overseer papers
no work here
mairie officer valjean as a dangerous
man you will be on parole forever
failure to report
means immediate arrest
be in pontarlier in 30 days
follow him
exclaims in annoyance
yelling
innkeeper let me
see your papers
monsieur

ill sleep in the stable
please im hungry
get out
groans
exhales
gasps hey
singing come in
sir for you are weary
and the night is cold
out here
though our lives
are very humble
what we have
we have to share
there is wine
here to revive you
there is bread
to make you strong
theres a bed to
rest till morning
rest from pain
and rest from wrong
bless the food we eat today
bless our dear sister
and our honored guest
sighs
clattering
get in there
put him down
stay there
groans
constable monsignor
we have your silver
we caught this man
redhanded
he had the nerve to
say you gave him this
singing that is right
but my friend
you left so early
surely something
slipped your mind
you forgot i gave these also
would you leave
the best behind
messieurs release him
this man has spoken true
i commend you for your duty
now gods blessing go with you
but remember this my brother
see in this some higher plan
you must use
this precious silver
to become an honest man
by the witness of the martyrs
by the passion and the blood
god has raised
you out of darkness
i have saved your soul for
god
singing what have i done
sweet jesus what have i done
become a thief in the night
become a dog on the run
have i fallen so far
and is the hour so late
that nothing remains
but the cry of my hate
the cries in the dark
that nobody hears
here where i stand at
the turning of the years
if theres another way to go
i missed it 20 long years ago
my life was a war
that could never be won
they gave me a number
and they murdered valjean
when they chained me
and left me for dead
just for stealing
a mouthful of bread
breathing heavily
yet why did i allow this man
to touch my soul
and teach me love
he treated me like any other
he gave me his trust
he called me brother
my life he claims
for god above
can such things be
for i had come
to hate the world
this world that
always hated me
take an eye for an eye
turn your heart into stone
this is all i have lived for
this is all i have known
one word from him
and id be back
beneath the lash
upon the rack
instead he offers me
my freedom
i feel my shame inside me
like a knife
he told me that i have a soul
how does he know
what spirit comes
to move my life
weeping
is there another way to go
i am reaching but i fall
and the night is closing in
as i stare into the void
to the whirlpool of my sin
ill escape now
from that world
from the world of jean valjean
jean valjean is nothing now
another story must begin
dramatic music playing
beggars chorus singing at the end
of the day youre another day older
and thats all you can say
for the life of the poor
its a struggle its a war
and theres nothing
that anyones giving
one more day standing about
what is it for
one day less to be living
at the end of the day
youre another day colder
and the shirt on your back
doesnt keep out the chill
and the righteous hurry past they
dont hear the little ones crying
and the plague is coming
on fast ready to kill
one day nearer to dying
at the end of the day
theres another day dawning
and the sun in the morning
is waiting to rise
like the waves
crash on the sand
like a storm
thatll break any second
theres a hunger in the land theres
a reckoning still to be reckoned
and theres gonna be hell to
pay at the end of the day
factory women assume
shushing
at the end of the day
you get nothing for nothing
sitting flat on your bum
doesnt buy any bread

back at home
and the children
have got to be fed
and youre lucky

love to one already dead
man exhales
coins clinking
there was a time
when men were kind
when their voices were soft
and their words inviting
there was a time
when love was blind
and the world was a song
and the song was exciting
there was a time
then it all went wrong
i dreamed a dream
in time gone by
when hope was high
and life worth living
i dreamed that
love would never die
i dreamed that god
would be forgiving
then i was young and unafraid
and dreams were made
and used and wasted
there was no ransom to be paid
no song unsung
no wine untasted
but the tigers come at night
with their voices
soft as thunder
as they tear your hope apart
as they turn
your dream to shame
he slept a summer by my side
he filled my days
with endless wonder
he took my childhood
in his stride
but he was gone
when autumn came
sobbing
and still i dream
hell come to me
that we will live
the years together
but there are dreams
that cannot be
and there are storms
we cannot weather
sobbing
i had a dream my life would be
so different from
this hell im living
so different now
from what it seemed
now
life has killed the dream
i dreamed
have you anywhere to go
no you need to get warm

holy god is there no mercy

honest work just reward
thats the way
to please the lord
a moment of your time javert
i do believe this womans tale
monsieur le mayor
youve done your duty

she needs a doctor
not a jail
monsieur le mayor
can this be
where will she end
this child without a friend
ive seen your face before
shivering
show me some way to help you
how have you come to grief
in such a place as this
monsieur
dont mock me now i pray
its hard enough
ive lost my pride
you let your foreman
send me away
yes you were there
and turned aside
spits
weeping
i never did no wrong
is it true what ive done
my daughters close to dying
to an innocent soul
if theres a god above
had i only known then
hed let me die instead
in his name
my task has just begun
i will take her
to the hospital
monsieur le mayor
where is your child
with an innkeeper
in montfermeil
i will send for her
immediately
singing
i will see it done
rest
from paris monsieur
singing monsieur le mayor
i have a crime to declare
i have disgraced
the uniform that i wear
ive done you wrong
let no forgiveness be shown
ive been as hard
on every rogue i have known
i mistook you for a convict
i have made a false report
now i learn they caught the culprit
hes about to face the court
and of course he now denies
it youd expect that of a con
but he couldnt run forever
no not even jean valjean
you say this man denies it all
and gives no sign of
understanding or repentance
you say this man
is going to trial
and that hes sure to be
returned to serve his sentence
he will pay and so must i
press charges against me sir
you have only
done your duty
its a minor sin
at most
all of us have
made misjudgments
youll return sir
to your post
sighs in relief
they think that man is me
without a second glance
this stranger they have found
this man could be my chance
why should i save his hide
why should i right this wrong
when i have come so far
and struggled for so long
if i speak i am condemned
if i stay silent
i am damned
i am the master of
hundreds of workers
they all look to me
can i abandon them how would
they live if i am not free
if i speak they are condemned
if i stay silent
i am damned
who am i
can i condemn
this man to slavery
pretend i do not
feel his agony
this innocent
who bears my face
who goes to judgment
in my place
who am i
can i conceal
myself forevermore
pretend im not
the man i was before
and must my name until i die
be no more than an alibi
must i lie
how can i ever
face my fellow men
how can i ever
face myself again
my soul belongs to god i know
i made that bargain long ago
he gave me hope
when hope was gone
he gave me
strength to journey on
who am i
who am i
im jean valjean
urges horse
monsieur le mayan
singing and so
your honor you see its true
this man bears
no more guilt than you
who am i
magistrate monsieur le mayor
you are not well
you must come with me
if you dont believe me
ask inspector javert
youll find me
at the hospital
audience murmuring
singing cosette
its turned so cold
coughing weakly
cosette
its past your bedtime
youve played the day away
and soon it will be night
come to me
cosette the light is fading

the evening star appearing

valjean shushing

and ill see her when i wake
sighs in dismay
gasps
valjean at last
we see each other plain
monsieur le mayor
youll wear a different chain
before you say
another word javert
before you chain me up
like a slave again
listen to me
there is something i must do
this woman leaves
behind a suffering child
there is none but me
who can intercede
in mercys name
three days are all i need
then ill return
i pledge my word
then ill return
you must think me mad
ive hunted you
across the years
men like you
can never change
a man such as you
believe of me what you will
men like you
can never change
there is a duty
im sworn to do
men like me
can never change
you know nothing of my life

my duty is to the law
you know nothing
of the world
you have no rights
you would sooner
see me dead
come with me 24601
but not before
i see this justice done
javert now the wheel
has turned around
jean valjean
means nothing now
dare you talk to me
of crime
i am warning you javert
and the price
you had to pay
im the stronger man by far
every man is born in sin
there is power in me yet
every man
must choose his way
my race is not yet run
you know nothing of javert
i was born inside a jail
i was born
with scum like you
i am from the gutter too
lively music playing

shes nice to see
and shes soft to touch
she says whispering cosette
i love you very much
i know a place
where no ones lost

yesterday i was alone
today you are beside me
something still unclear
something not yet here
has begun
suddenly the world
seems a different place
somehow full of grace
full of light
how was i to know
that so much hope
was held inside me
what is passed is gone
now we journey on
through the night
how was i to know at last that
happiness can come so fast
trusting me the way you do
im so afraid of failing you
just a child who cannot know
that danger follows where i go
there are shadows everywhere
and memories i cannot share
nevermore alone
nevermore apart
you have warmed my heart
like the sun
you have brought the gift of
life and love so long denied me
suddenly i see
what i could not see
something suddenly
has begun
sighs contentedly

fallen from god

god be my witness
i never shall yield
till we come face to face
till we come face to face
he knows his way in the dark
mine is the way of the lord
those who follow
the path of the righteous
shall have their reward
and if they fall
as lucifer fell
the flames the sword
stars in your multitudes
scarce to be counted
filling the darkness
with order and light
you are the sentinels
silent and sure
keeping watch in the night
keeping watch in the night
you know your place in the sky
you hold your course
and your aim
and each in your season
returns and returns
and is always the same
and if you fall
as lucifer fell
you fall in flames
and so it must be
for so it is written
on the doorway to paradise
that those who falter
and those who fall
must pay the price
lord let me find him
that i may see him
safe behind bars
i will never rest till then

ive never heard
him ooh and aah
you talk of
battles to be won
and here he comes
like don juan
it is better
than an opera
laughing
it is time for us all
to decide who we are
do we fight for the right
to a night at the opera now
have you asked of yourself
whats the price you might pay
is this simply a game
for a rich young boy to play
the colors of the world
are changing day by day
red the blood of angry men
black the dark of ages past
red a world about to dawn
black
the night that ends at last
had you seen her today
you might know how it feels
to be struck to the bone in a
moment of breathless delight
had you been there today
you might also have known
how your world may be changed
in just one burst of light
and what was right seems wrong
and what was wrong seems right
red
i feel my soul on fire
black
my world if shes not there
all red
the color of desire
all black
the color of despair
marius
youre no longer a child
i do not doubt
you mean it well
but now
there is a higher call
i know
who cares about
your lonely soul
we strive
towards a larger goal
our little lives
dont count at all
red
all the blood of angry men
black
the dark of ages past
red
a world about to dawn
black
the night that ends at last
listen everybody
general lamarque
is dead
singing lamarque his
death is the hour of fate
the peoples man
his death is
the sign we await
on his funeral day
they will honor his name
with the light of
rebellion ablaze in their eyes
from their candles of grief
we will kindle our flame
on the tomb of lamarque
shall our barricade rise
the time is here
let us welcome it gladly
with courage and cheer
let us take to the streets
with no doubt in our hearts
but a jubilant shout
they will come one and all
all they will come
when we call
students chattering
indistinctly
did you find her
singing
how strange
this feeling that
my lifes begun at last
this change
can people really
fall in love so fast
whats the matter
with you cosette
have you been
too much on your own
so many things unclear
so many things unknown
in my life
there are so many
questions and answers
that somehow seem wrong
in my life
there are times when
i catch in the silence
the sigh of a faraway song
and it sings
of a world that i long to see
out of reach
just a whisper away
waiting for me
does he know im alive
do i know if hes real
does he see what i see
does he feel what i feel
in my life
im no longer alone
now the love in
my life is so near
find me now
find me here
dear cosette
youre such a lonely child
how pensive
how sad you seem to me
believe me
were it within my power
id fill each passing hour
how quiet it must be
i can see
with only me for company
theres so little i know
that im longing to know
of the man that you were
in a time long ago
please cosette
theres so little you say
of the life you have known
why you keep to yourself
why youre always alone
so dark
so dark and deep
the secrets that you keep
in my life
please forgive what i say you
are loving and gentle and good
but papa dear papa
in your eyes i am still like that
child who was lost in a wood
no more words
no more words
its a time that is dead
there are words
that are better unheard
better unsaid
in my life
im no longer a child and i yearn
for the truth that you know
of the years years ago
you will learn
truth is given by god
to us all in our time
in our turn
in my life
she has burst like the music
of angels the light of the sun
and my life seems to stop
as if something is over
and something
has scarcely begun
eponine youre the friend
who has brought me here
thanks to you
im at one with the gods
and heaven is near
and i soar through a world
that is new that is free
every word that he says
is a dagger in me
in my life
theres been no one
like him anywhere
anywhere where he is
if he asked id be his
both in my life
there is someone
who touches my life
waiting near
waiting here
a heart full of love
a heart full of song
im doing everything
all wrong
oh god for shame

raindrops pattering
singing on my own
pretending hes beside me
all alone
i walk with him till morning
without him
i feel his arms around me
and when i lose my way
i close my eyes
and he has found me
in the rain
the pavement
shines like silver
all the lights
are misty in the river
in the darkness the trees
are full of starlight
and all i see is him and me
forever and forever
and i know
its only in my mind
that im talking to myself
and not to him
and although
i know that he is blind
still i say
theres a way for us
i love him
but when the night is over
he is gone
the rivers just a river
without him
the world around me changes
the trees are bare
and everywhere
the streets are
full of strangers
i love him
but every day im learning
all my life
ive only been pretending
without me
his world will go on turning
a world thats
full of happiness
that i have never known
sobs
i love him
i love him
i love him
but only on my own
singing
one day more
another day

a flick of his knife
vengeance was his
and he gave me back my life
damned if i live in
the debt of a thief
damned if i yield at
the end of the chase
i am the law and
the law is not mocked
ill spit his pity
right back in his face
there is nothing on earth
that we share
it is either
valjean or javert
and my thoughts fly apart
can this man be believed
shall his sins be forgiven
shall his crimes be reprieved
and must i now begin to doubt
who never doubted
all these years
my heart is stone
and still it trembles
the world i have known
is lost in shadow
is he from heaven
or from hell
and does he know
that granting me my life today
this man has
killed me even so
i am reaching but i fall
and the stars
are black and cold
as i stare into the void
of a world that cannot hold
ill escape now
from that world
from the world of jean valjean
there is nowhere i can turn
there is no way to go on
turning woman 1 singing did
you see them going off to fight
turning woman 2 children of the
barricade who didnt last the night
did you see them
lying where they died
someone used to cradle them
and kiss them when they cried
did you see them
lying side by side
singing theres a grief
that cant be spoken
theres a pain goes on and on
empty chairs at empty tables
now my friends
are dead and gone
here they talked of revolution
here it was they lit the flame
here they sang about tomorrow
and tomorrow never came
from the table in the corner
they could see a world reborn
and they rose
with voices ringing
and i can hear them now
the very words
that they have sung
became their last communion
on this lonely barricade
at dawn
oh my friends
my friends forgive me
that i live and you are gone
theres a grief
that cant be spoken
theres a pain goes on and on
phantom faces at the windows
phantom shadows on the floor
empty chairs at empty tables
where my friends
will meet no more
oh my friends my friends
dont ask me
what your sacrifice was for
empty chairs at empty tables
where my friends will sing
no more
singing every day you walk
with stronger step
you walk with longer step
the worst is over
dont think about it
marius
with all the years
ahead of us
i will never go away
and we will be
together every day
every day
well remember that night
and the vow that we made
a heart full of love
she was never mine to keep
a night full of you
she is youthful she is free
cosette the words are old
but always true
cosette cosette
love is
the garden of the young
cosette i saw you waiting
and i knew
thank god you are here
waiting for you
let it be
at your feet
thank god you are home
let it be
valjean a heart full of love
both and it wasnt a dream
this i give you this day
both not a dream after all
monsieur this is a day
i never can forget
ls gratitude enough
for giving me cosette
your home shall be with us
and not a day shall pass
but we will prove our love
to you whom we shall call
a father to us both
a father to us all
not another word my son
theres something now
that must be done
there lived a man
whose name was jean valjean
he stole some bread to
save his sisters son
for 19 winters
he served his time
in sweat
he washed away his crime
years ago
he broke parole and
lived a life apart
how could he tell cosette
and break her heart
marius
its for cosette
this must be faced
if he is caught
she is disgraced
the time has come
to journey on
and from this day
he must be gone
who am i
who am i
youre jean valjean
monsieur you cannot leave
whatever i tell my beloved
cosette she will never believe
tell her ive gone on a
journey a long way away
tell her my heart was
too full for farewells
it is better this way
promise me monsieur
cosette will never know
what i have spoken
why i must go
for the sake of cosette
it must be so
thank you marius
singing wheres he gone
without a word
that wouldnt be
his way to go
why so sudden
why so strange
groaning oh did he say
how long hell be gone
all he asked for me to say
is hes on a journey far away
he cant leave us now
how he breaks my heart
and we will never be apart
i promise you
joyful music playing
the baron and
baroness du thanard
singing
go away thenardier
do you think
i dont know who you are
hes not fooled
told you so
show monsieur
what youve come here to show
tell the boy what you know
pity to disturb you
at a feast like this
but 500 francs
surely wouldnt come amiss
in gods name
say what you have to say
he speaks
you pay
what i saw clear as light
jean valjean in
the sewers one night
had this corpse on his back
some boy he had killed
in a vicious attack
i was there never fear
i even found me
this fine souvenir
i know this
this is mine
this is surely
some heavenly sign
then its true
then im right
jean valjean was
my savior that night
jean valjean the old con
you pay up
or ill say where hes gone
where is he
where is he
the convent
cosette come with me
come with me
both singing watch the buggers
dance watch em till they drop
keep your wits about you
and youll stand on top
masters of the land
always get our share
clear away the barricades
and were still there
we know where
the wind is blowing
money is the stuff we smell
and when were rich
as croesus
jesus wont
we see you all in hell
how dare you
singing
alone i wait in the shadows
i count the hours
until i sleep
i dreamed a dream
cosette stood by
it made her weep
to know i die
alone at the end of the day
upon this wedding night
i pray
take these children my lord
to thy embrace
and show them grace
god on high
hear my prayer
take me now
to thy care
where you are
let me be
take me now
take me there
bring me home
sighs
bring me home
groans
fantine monsieur
i bless your name
i am ready fantine
monsieur
lay down your burden
at the end of my days
you raised my child in love
shes the best of my life
and you will be with god
oh
oh
softly fantine
singing papa papa
i do not understand
are you all right
why did you go away
exclaims in relief
cosette my child
am i forgiven now
thank god thank god
ive lived to see this day
its you who must forgive
a thoughtless fool
its you who must
forgive a thankless man
its thanks to you
that i am living
and again i lay down
my life at your feet
cosette
your father is a saint
when they wounded me
he took me from the barricade
carried like a babe
and brought me home to you
now you are here
again beside me
now i can die in peace
for now my life is blessed
you will live papa
youre going to live
its too soon
too soon to say goodbye
yes cosette
forbid me now to die
ill obey
i will try
on this page
i write my last confession
read it well
when i at last am sleeping
its the story
of one who turned from hating
a man who only learned to love
when you were in his keeping
i know it papa
come with me
where chains
will never bind you
i am ready fantine
all your grief
at last at last behind you
lord in heaven
look down on him in mercy
forgive me all my trespasses
and take me to your glory
fantine take my hand
ill lead you to salvation
take my love
for love is everlasting
all and remember
the truth that once was spoken
to love another person
is to see the face of god
crowd do you hear the people sing
lost in the valley of the night
it is the music of a people
who are climbing to the light
for the wretched of the earth
there is a flame
that never dies
even the darkest night will
end and the sun will rise
we will live again in freedom
in the garden of the lord
we will walk behind the plowshare
we will put away the sword
the chain will be broken and all
men will have their reward
will you join
in our crusade
who will be strong
and stand with me
somewhere beyond
the barricade
ls there a world
you long to see
do you hear the people sing
say do you hear
the distant drums
it is the future that we bring
when tomorrow comes
will you join
in our crusade
who will be strong
and stand with me
somewhere beyond
the barricade
ls there a world
you long to see
do you hear the people sing
say do you hear
the distant drums
