 molly  a survey was taken
a few years ago that asked
three hundred professionals
one question 
 what s the worst thing
that can happen in sports  
some people answered 
losing at game seven 
 male announcer  he scores 
bruins win in seven games 
 molly  and other people
said getting swept in 4 
 indistinct commentary 
some people said it was
missing the world cup 
 male announcer 
guatemala is eliminated 
 male  1 
goal 
 molly  and some brazilian said
it was losing to argentina 
not just in the world cup 
any time  ever  in any contest 
but one person answered
that the worst thing
that can happen in sports is
fourth place at the olympics 
this is a true story 
but except for my own
i ve changed all the names
and i ve done my best
to obscure identities for
reasons that ll become clear 
i m molly bloom 
and right now  i m ranked third
in north america
in woman s moguls 
i grew up
in loveland  colorado
about two hours
north of denver 
i have a b a 
in political science
from the university
of colorado
where i graduated
summa cum laude
with a 3 9 gpa 
the median l sat score
at harvard law school is 169 
my score is 173 
number 87  up 
fifty six on deck 
i ve spent 16 years
chasing winter
and being coached
by the best in the world 
sundays were for working out
with my father 
something s really wrong 
 molly 
when i was 12 years old
for no particular reason
my back exploded 
tough it out 
  good advice 
  and lose the attitude 
 molly  less than 10
minutes later  i was in
the back of an ambulance 
i had what s called
rapid onset scoliosis 
my spine was curved
at 63 degrees
and i d need a seven hour
surgical procedure
that involved
straightening my spine
extracting bone from my hip
fusing 11 vertebrae together
and fastening steel rods
to the fused segments 
  she s gonna be fine 
  oh 
i wouldn t let her ski anymore 
definitely not moguls 
and obviously
skiing competitively
is out of the question 
oh  god  thank you 
 molly 
i was on skis again in a year 
running moguls in 18 months
and by my 20th birthday
i made the u s  ski team 
it s the last round
of qualifying
for the salt lake city
olympics 
this is the champion run
at deer valley 
the altitude is 8100 feet 
and the pitch is 52 degrees
which is the same as the sides
of the great pyramids 
the wind s 20 to 25 miles
an hour blowing left to right 
it s 3 below zero
at the top of the slope 
and with seventeen skiers
in front of me
it s gonna be like trying
to stick a landing
on a frozen infinity pool 
kiki blew out of her line 
shannon was off balance
on her second landing 
 molly 
he s talking about kiki bandy
and shannon keebler
my two toughest competitors
who had significant
point deductions
on their final runs 
i can make the olympic team 
  right now 
  go get it 
and if i have three prefect
runs in salt lake
the best runs of my life
i can beat the austrians
and the swiss
and have a realistic shot
at the podium 
then law school
and then a start up 
a foundation that seeds
entrepreneurial women 
my father s
at the bottom of the slope
telepathically telling me
to check my line 
  check your line 
  i check my line 
 male announcer 
ready 
 molly  good snow contact 
calm upper body 
legs together  good shape 
no line deviation 
set up for the d spin and   
stick the landing 
now  two things you need
to know
before the second trick
which will be a 720 
the first is that
when visibility is bad
the way it is now 
race officials toss pine boughs
on the course
so the skiers have some
foreground depth reference 
the second is that
the tightness of your bindings
is determined by what s
called a din setting 
if you re a beginner  your din
setting is probably a 2 or 3 
if you re an experienced
weekend skier
it s probably seven or eight 
mine s fifteen 
my boots are basically welded
to my skis  right 
so how does this happen 
it happened
because i hit a pine bough
that had become frozen
in the snow 
and i hit it so precisely
that it simply snapped
the release of my bindings 
right in that moment
i didn t have time
to calculate the odds
of that happening
because i was about
to land pretty hard
on my digitally re mastered
spinal cord
which was being held together
by spare parts
from an erector set 
 crowd gasps 
 screaming 
  give her room 
  get out of the way  move 
 molly  none of this has
anything to do with poker 
i m only mentioning it
because i wanted to say to
whoever answered that the worst
thing that could happen
in sports was 4th place
at the olympics   
seriously  fuck you 
 crickets chirping 
 phone ringing 
  hello 
  molly bloom

i m having a hard time seeing 
the  the flashlights in my eyes

  do you understand 
  uh  yes 
 tomasino 
say you understand 
i understand  but
there s been a mistake 
because i haven t
run a game in two years 
i want you to take a look at
this piece of paper right here 
can you see what
it says at the top 
yes 
read to me
what it says at the top 
 united states of america
vs  molly bloom  
i bet heavy on the favorite 
 larry 
alright  what do you  um   
think about
the following concepts 
just gonna run them by you 
  marriage 
  it is a trap 
  society 
  it is a joke 
people 
i    think there s good and bad 
but i don t trust them 
i don t trust people 
 molly  every year on our
birthdays  my father would
interview my younger
brothers and me 
 larry  who are the heroes
or heroines in your life 
who  uh    who do you
really respect 
i don t have any heroes 
 larry 
you don t have any heroes 
 molly 
how s this for hubris 
i don t 
because if i reach the goals
i set out for myself
then the person i become 
that ll be my hero 
 molly 
even by teenage girl standards
i would appear
to be irrationally angry
at nothing in particular 
it would be another 22 years
before i d find out why 
after my colossal wipe out
at deer valley
i decided to take a year off
before law school 
i needed to go away 
sever myself from reality
and come up with a new plan 
so i chose los angeles 
a friend of mine
from the ski team
had agreed to let me crash
on her couch for a while 
my father had disapproved
of postponing law school
and so  declined to help out 
but i had  1700 dollars i d
saved from babysitting money
and that would support me until
i found a waitressing job 
i d already had a career
and retired from it 
i wanted to be young
for a while in warm weather 
i think that s what i wanted at
first  it s hard to remember 
i got a job working
bottle service at a club
in hollywood
called  nacional nightclub  
it was cuban themed 
so my uniform
was camouflaged short shorts
and a wife beater 
the promoter would go over
which record producer
was sitting where  which
hot designers  which lakers
and borislava the bulgarian
billionaire  who didn t drink 
but he ran a  100 000 bar tab 
my job was
to get people to spend
more money than they needed to 
could we get a bottle of skyy 
you guys look like
you deserve grey goose 
what do guys who deserve
grey goose look like 
to begin with 
they ve got a bottle
of grey goose in front of them 
you re quick  very clever 
uh  alright  yeah  grey goose 
 molly  they just spent an
additional  300 dollars
bringing their total
to  900 dollars
for  8 and 50 cents
worth of vodka 
but the club doesn t
need you to buy a bottle 
they need you
to buy five bottles 
so these girls over here
they let you buy them
shots for a living 
it would be like waiting
in a long line to get into
the gap so you can pay
1000  percent mark up
to buy all the employees
a pair of pants 
i only had one shift a week 
i didn t wanna tell my parents
i was a cocktail waitress and
back then  i never turned down
an opportunity
to make more money 
so i found a second job
as an office assistant 
and that s how i ended up
working for dean keith 
 instrumental music 
dean was a partner
in black hues investments 
he was a regular at the club 
and one night he said   
people seem to take to you 
hey  how would you like to
get paid to go to grad school
and get an mba
in how life works 
what makes you think
you know and i don t 
i m a regular here
and you re a waitress here 
look at the fuckin  scoreboard 
 molly  dean explained what
my job was by saying   
me  i m your job 
 molly  i answered the phone  made
coffee runs  set appointments 
  made spread sheets 
  what is that 
and showed dean
what a spreadsheet was 
spreadsheet 
but i made  450 dollars
a week on top
of the  300
i was making at the club 
which would be enough
to get off my friend s couch 
i remember the day started
by being about bagels 
  this is molly 
  get to the office 
 dean 
pick up bagels 
do you mean now 
 molly 
dean was a hollywood staple 
over leveraged  going broke 
trying to prove
he wasn t broke and making
a true effort to be
as vulgar as possible 
honestly making an effort 
i hadn t told anyone
i was a skier
and it was hard not
to laugh when dean said   
anyone ever teach you
how to fuckin  hurry 
  no 
  what are those 
bagels 
  are these from blue bell 
  yeah 
  it s on the way from my house 
  seriously 
you might as well have stopped
at a fuckin  homeless shelter 
you might as well
have walked into
a mother fucking
homeless shelter and said
 i d like a dozen bagels from
this homeless shelter  please  
i do not eat bagels
from blue fucking bell  molly
because these
are poor people bagels 
from where would you like me
to get your bagels   
forget about the fuckin  bagels 
  done 
  except smarten up 
  got it 
  hang on 
 molly 
like i said  the day started
by being about bagels 
but that would abruptly change 
my weekly poker game
is moving to the cobra lounge 
tomorrow night 
and then every tuesday night 
you ll help run it 
take these names and numbers 
tell them to bring
ten grand in cash
for the first buy in 
the blinds are 51 100 
  and molly 
  yeah 
don t fucking tell anybody 
 molly  i d regarded dean as a
nitwit when i regarded him at all 
but on that pad were nine names
along with phone numbers of
some of the wealthiest and most
famous people in the world 
i put the numbers in my phone
and composed a simple message 
there d be a game tomorrow
night at the cobra lounge 
there was
a  10 000 dollar buy in 
all nine players confirmed
that they d be there 
all within 90 seconds
of my sending the text 
 molly  the cobra lounge sits on
the edge of the sunset strip 
and in it s heyday was famous
for introducing unknown bands
like  the doors 
and  the beach boys  
all i knew was school work
and skiing 
i d always figured
sophistication
would be easy to learn
if i ever needed it 
my cheese platter had
a sticker that read
 cheese from the great state
of michigan  
diego  a professional dealer
was setting up the table
when i got there 
i googled  what type of music
do poker players
like to listen to  
and then tried to figure out
how to make a playlist
out of one kenny rogers song 
i set up the bar   
put out my cheese platter   
and positioned myself
at the door where i d been
instructed to only let in
the names on the list 
i was wearing my best dress 
which i had bought
two years earlier
at j c  penney for  88 
the players started to arrive 
i introduced myself as molly 
dean s assistant 
for you 
asked if i could
get them a drink 
and took from each of them
 10 000 in cash 
  hi 
  hi 
i m   
i know 
  your boss   
  everybody here 
  yeah 
  hey  buddy 
fuck off 
i m gonna own your shit 
ugly dress 
ugly shoes 
let s play 
 molly  diego fanned nine
cards out on the table
and the players
chose for seats 
 diego 
eleven and eleven   
he checked 
the action s on you 
 molly  i just finished
counting out  90 000 in cash 
i was in a room
with movie stars  directors 
rappers  boxers 
  he s in trouble 
  and business titans 
they were going all in 
all the time 
burning through their
buy ins over and over 
  here you go  good luck
  thank you so much

playing the rush 
you keeping track
of the buy ins

 indistinct chatter

all in 
 molly 
the game ended at 3 30 
and when it did 
that s when dean shouted out   
hey  tip molly if you wanna
get invited back next week 
 molly 
tip molly 
deep down  i didn t like
the sound of that 
deep down  i knew
that when your boss says   
  and molly 
  yeah 
don t fucking tell anybody 
 molly  that s usually
not the beginning
of a promising law career 
see you next week 
 molly 
but that was deep down 
i just made  3000

a minimal flight risk
and bail was set

my mother signed over her house 
i was released on wednesday

i flew here wednesday and met
with five attorneys yesterday

you didn t hire any of them 
three of them had
already been taken 
yeah  31 people were named
in your indictment 
it s black friday
for criminal lawyers 
how about the other two 
one told me money was his
second favorite form of payment 
  i know him 
  the fifth was also taken 
  but he recommended i call you 
  why 
i told him i wanted someone
who d worked in
the prosecutor s office and
wasn t even a little bit shady 
do you know about me 
um  i ve been briefed a little
by my daughter  who knows
a lot about your story
because her mother s a moron 
  her mother reads the tabloids 
  yeah  and i read them too 
i read your indictment
after i got your call last night
and i bought your book 
i m only on page 112 
but  molly  did you commit
a felony and then write
a book about it 
i haven t run a game
in over two years 
not to spoil the ending 
but that s
when the government
raided my game
and took all my money assuming
all of it was made illegally 
which it wasn t 
i ve been living in my
mother s house in telluride
and    i wrote the book so i
could start paying off debts 
i just finished the press tour
for the book and i moved back
to los angeles
so i could start over 
hm  you ran games in l a 
for roughly eight years 
  yeah  right 
  without taking a rake 
and then you ran games
in new york for roughly two 
well  i took a rake
for the last six months 
in the first 112 pages 
you name a bunch of names 
  sorry 
  uh 
you named the names
of some movie stars
that played in your game 
yeah 
that not against
some sort of poker code 
am i supposed to be sitting
all the way over here 
  can you hear me from there 
  yeah 
are you taking me
on as a client 
my retainer is  250 000 
do you have  250 000 
no  i don t have anything 
what about the sales
from your book 
the book isn t
jumping off the shelves 
but i will find a way
to pay you  charlie 
ask around about me 
unfortunately 
the people i d ask
are goin  away for a while 
what happened on tuesday morning
was called a  gps takedown  
thirty one people were arrested
in the same instant 
something in excess
of 600 agents were dispatched
to locations
in new york and l a 
in coordinated strikes
with automatic weapons 
and you re trying to tell me
you re in my office
because you raked a game
of texas hold  em 
have you seen the other names
in your indictment 
 nicholas kozlowski 
peter druzhinsky 
peter antonovich 
the gershen brothers  
i mean come on  molly 
just how deep
into the russian mob were you 
because your book doesn t say 
why are you making your daughter
read  the crucible  
so she can see
what happens to a group
of bored teenage girls
when they gossip 
  i never read the play 
  many consider it to be   
the best play
of the 20th century 
is that what
many consider it to be   
i don t defend
violent criminals 
  i ve never hurt anyone   
  your friends have 
i ve never heard of 90 
of the names   
  on the indictment 
  and the other 10  
i didn t know they were
connected 
i d no idea
who they were 
let me ask you a question 
the character in the book
you call  dean keith 
he didn t say
 poor people bagels   did he 
i think i know who he is 
i think i know
a real estate lawyer
that worked with him
and quit 
he said   
 nigger bagels   right 
i m not telling you his real
name  he s not involved in this 
but you were willing
to name some names 
 chair scraping the floor 
why is the fbi arresting me
two years after
i stopped running games 
were you paid extra
in your book deal
to name the movie stars 
i m not your guy  molly 
i wish you good luck 
but this just isn t for me 
 charlie sighs 
 sighs 
i didn t know
who the russians were 
i can get you
the  250 000 
i left 10 times
that on the street 
it ll just take some time 
we regularly lend out our best
litigators like me to the aclu
southern poverty law center 
veterans groups 
but i don t think
i can convince my partners
to take a flyer
on  the poker princess  
i didn t name myself
 the poker princess  
uh   molly bloom  the self
proclaimed poker princess    
is that  us weekly  
yeah  i would agree
it would be unusual
for them to print
something that wasn t true 
but it s not true 
and if you think
a princess can do what i did 
you re incorrect 
i m getting you don t
think much of me 
but what if every one
of your ill informed
unsophisticated opinions
about me were wrong 
  i d be amazed 
  yeah  you know what  bud 
  you would 
  you don t need me 
  you need a publicist 
  no  i need a fucking lawyer 
you didn t answer my question 
when was the last time
you slept 
it was a while ago 
alright 
i m gonna walk you through
the arraignment this morning
 cause you shouldn t
do that alone 
i m gonna put some bodies
on you and walk you
through the side door 
 cause i don t know
what you ve got on the russians 
but neither do they 
and the russians
take care of shit 
do you understand
what i m saying 
yes 
 instrumental music 
almost  you gotta keep
your eyes up  alright 
always gotta look ahead 
if you look down
that s where
you re gonna go 
alright 
if you look down
that s where you ll go 
alright 
  yeah 
  alright 
let s go 
 molly 
my father s a therapist
and psychology professor
at colorado state 
no  no 
 molly 
the second rule of his house
is that academic excellence
and athletic excellence
weren t optional 
you can t be afraid of it 
alright 
don t play defense 
 molly 
and the first rule
was that he made all the rules 
again 
dad  i m pretty tired 
hon  she s tired 
we ve been out here
since 6 o clock 
her lips are blue 
  you re tired 
  yeah 
what s another word for tired 
name a synonym for tired
and we ll get in the car 
weak 
that s right 
let s go home 
again 
 molly  i decided to postpone
law school another year 
after six weeks of tips 
i went to barneys
and asked for a dress that made
me look nothing like myself 
i d overheard stories
about games that folded
after one bad night and i
needed this one to keep going 
and i needed to bring
value to it 
 molly  i knew if i
wanted to cement my place
there was one guy i needed
to team up with 
ten thousand 
 molly 
and that was this man 
the game had regulars
and the game had guests 
and four of the regulars
were famous actors 
and i m gonna call one of them
player x 
i m all in 
 molly 
player x subscribed
to the belief that money won
was twice as good
as money earned 
he lived to beat people
and take their money 
here s player x
talking to one of the guests
into folding the winning hand 
i swear on    look at me 
i swear on my mother s life 
i have you 
 molly  player x was the best
player at the table  and tonight   
this guy was the worst 
he s staring at his cards 
even a reasonably good amateur
would know it was
mathematically the best hand 
which in poker
is called  the nuts  
there was  47 000 in the pot
and the guest
was holding the nuts 
but he was starting
to get confused
because a movie star
was talking to him 
my mother s life man 
i m not messing with you 
why would you be telling me 
either i am messing with you
or you re new to the game 
you ve had bad cards all night 
you should ve folded
after the flop
and i don t wanna win
more of your money this way 
i ve got queens under here 
take your time 
  fold 
  fuck you 
  no 
  oh 
 instrumental music 
 molly  a fish is a
particular kind of player 
a fish has money 
a fish plays loose
and doesn t fold a lot 
a fish is good   
but not too good 
there s an atm in the hall  bro 
 molly 
the cobra lounge may belong
to dean keith 
but the game belonged
to player x 
people wanted to say
they played with him 
the same way they wanted to say
they rode on air force one 
my job security
was gonna depend
on bringing him his fish 
but where would i find people
with a lot of money
who didn t know how to spend it
and liked to be
around celebrities 
if they say
they re interested in poker
you give  em my number 
i vet them 
they end up playing in a game   
i ll give you a  1000
the first time they play 
five hundred every time
after that 
be sure to mention
these guys are all regulars 
is this true 
these guys play 
 molly  the commerce casino is
off the 5 freeway in east l a 
and no one s ever gonna confuse
it with monte carlo 
i d watch the tables
for a while
before i approached
a friendly looking pit boss 
third chair
at table eight can t lose 
unless there are players
at his table who can win 
you know about the game
at the cobra lounge  right 
sure 
one thousand for every player
you send me 
you get a piece
of what they lose 
no pros 
i m molly 
 molly 
poker was my trojan horse
into the highest level
of finance  technology
politics  entertainment  art 
all i had to do was listen 
the art world is controlled
by a few major dealers 
china s telecom companies wanna
partner with other providers 
the owners don t mind
spending  30 million
on an outfielder
that hits 320 with 110 rbi 
they alone control the market 
they chose the artist
they wanna be important 
they don t mind
spending  10 million
on a pitcher
who is 8 14 this season 
  it s gonna be gephardt 
  they set the prices 
they even mark  em up 
70  80  90 percent 
they re all very excited
about a company called twitter 
unregulated money 
usually all cash  unreported 
  his days are numbered

 female  2  defendant number five 
ilian gershen 
 gershen 
good morning  your honor 
i m gonna have to keep
reading your book 
 instrumental music 
 molly  there was a track
star of the 1930 s
named matthew robinson 
matthew robinson shattered
the olympic record
in the 200
at the berlin games in 1936 
absolutely shattered
the olympic record   
and came in second 
the man who came in first
was jesse owens 
jesse owens went on
to be a legend 
matthew robinson
went on to be a janitor
at a whites only
middle school in pasadena 
the difference
was 4 10 of a second 
as if that wasn t enough
matthew robinson
had a little brother
who was also an athlete 
his name was jackie 
i have two younger brothers
who are overachievers as well 
while i was ranked third
in north america
my brother jeremy
was number one in the world 
and while i was placing into
ap chemistry as a sophomore
my brother jordan was doing it
when he was 12 years old
or something 
i don t know 
i was a hot shot student
and a hot shot skier
everywhere but my own house 
as i got older  i began
to bait my father into fights
without really knowing
why i was doing it 
what did everyone
learn in school today 
uh    i learned
that sigmund freud
was both a misogynist
and an idiot 
and anyone who relies
on his theories
of human psychology is a quack 
i don t know why you d say that 
you asked me what i
learned in school today 
  is this mrs  linwood 
  yup 
did she happen
to mention anything
about his work
on the unconscious mind 
his dream analysis has
the credibility of a horoscope 
but what got my attention
was that he opposed the women s
emancipation movement 
he believed that a woman s life
is about her
reproductive functions 
so you re really getting
to the nuts and bolts
of why middle class
suburban white girls
have been oppressed
for centuries 
no  mrs  linwood was just   
barbara linwood
doesn t like men  molly 
she doesn t like dicks 
dad  there s a difference 
molly   
don t disrespect me
like that at the table 
i wasn t disrespecting you 
i was disrespecting freud 
and it s the kitchen table
not the tomb
of the unknown soldier 
and i m a professional
psychologist  not a quack 
  i never said you were   
  yeah  you did 
and don t do it again 
and don t ever use language
like that again 
okay  ignore my teachers 
watch my language
and respect the kitchen table 
what else do i
need to do before
i m allowed
to disagree with you 
make your own money
so you can live
in your own house   
and eat your own food 
 molly  i d been running
the game for three years
and saved  58 000 
i was recruiting
and vetting players 
  keeping the books 
  call 
collecting
and delivering checks 
meeting the needs
of all the players
through out the week
and still working
full time for dean keith 
who made it clear that
if i quit the office job
i d lose the game 
  call 
  eights  full of nines 
 clamoring 
i thought he had trips too 
he was slow playing
into the river
and he hid the pocket eights
pretty well 
it s a tough beat  man 
  you owe the game   
  i know what i owe the game 
i wanna talk to you a minute 
  okay 
  in the hall 
  it came from heartache  
  then it died  
  from the street      
is he cheating 
no 
  how would you know 
  i d know 
he and diego
aren t in bed together 
no 
what about him and you 
a 52 card deck produces
hundreds of millions
of random patterns 
but every time one of you loses
two weeks in a row
you re sure something fishy
is going on 
come on 
i m gonna stop paying you 
  what do you mean 
  as my assistant 
  are you firing me 
  i m not firing you 
i m just gonna stop paying you 
you get paid once a week
from the game 
it doesn t seem fair 
but i also have a job working
for you 24 hours   
and if you didn t have a job
you wouldn t have the game 
you understand what i m saying 
i understand each of the words
that you re saying but i don t   
  look 
  24 hours a day  every day 
but you re gonna stop paying me
to do that job
because i m making too much
money doing my second job 
and if i say no 
i ll lose both jobs 
because it doesn t seem fair 
business is bad right now 
welcome to the real world 
alright  here it is 
banks are loaning you money 
and they shouldn t 
you re a bad risk  they know it 
so the debt service
on your loans
is close to 20  
which is crazy 
twenty percent is
barely survivable
if it s a bridge loan 
but  like for instance
it s taken you 10 years
to build seven houses 
all of which are worth
less than they were
before you built them 
because the housing market
is on a downward trajectory
for the first time
in the history of houses 
and that s why business
is doing bad 
not because you re paying me
 450 a week 
you re a business savant 
i ve read every piece of paper
in your office 
you re making thousands
in tips every week 
why do you care about  450 
because i don t want to pick up
your dry cleaning for free 
well  you don t have
bargaining power here 
you can refuse the pay cut
but you could lose the game 
cash me out  please 
 molly 
i wasn t gonna wait for dean
to take the game away from me
before i put a plan in place 
the next morning 
i made appointments
at the four seasons 
the peninsula
and the beverly hills hotel 
the suite was  5200 a night 
i spent  17 000
on a shuffle master that was
installed in the table 
faster  more reliable shuffles 
less downtime between hands 
food was brought in
from mr  chow
and available to eat
on the side tables 
there was macallan 18
belvedere  1942
remy martin 
and a  88 lafite rothschild
served by a bartender who d
already memorized your drink 
cohibas and monte cristo
were in the humidor 
a professional stylist
turned me
into what my defense attorney
would later call
 the cinemax version
of myself  
i spent almost everything
i had in preparation
for the phone call
i knew was coming 
 phone ringing 
  hello 
  i want you to listen to me 
   cause you need to hear this 
  where are you 
i need to tell you something
in plain english
and i need to know
that you understood it 
  dean 
  you are unimportant 
do you hear me 
and you are fired 
the job  the game   
  you re fired 
  can i ask why 
how many of my friends
are you sleeping with 
i m not sleeping
with any of  em 
that s not what i heard 
listen to me 
with a hazmat suit  i wouldn t   
can i give you some advice 
lose the bitchy air 
lose the superior air 
and go to the office
and get your stuff
and be out of there
before i show up 
hey  are you molly 
yeah 
i m leah  um   
dean asked me
to pack your personals 
i appreciate it 
he also asked me
to get the numbers
of tonight s players
so i can confirm the list 
 leah 
i m really sorry 
don t be 
my phone s in my car 
uh  i ll text you
all the numbers
you need when i get downstairs 
i texted my replacement
a bunch of random numbers
with 310 area codes 
then i sent a text
to the players for tonight
and told them
the game had been moved
to the four seasons hotel 
suite 1401 
  hey  how you doing 
  drink 
  thank you very much 
  do you a part   
 molly 
i d love to 
yeah 
so this guy s producing it 
you should  uh  come down 
  amazing 
  yeah  it ll be fun 
 singing in foreign language 
fellas  can i have your
attention for a moment 
 music stops 
where s dean 
i ll be hosting a game in this
suite every tuesday night 
if you play tonight  you ll be
guaranteed a chair for a year 
if you prefer to play
at the cobra lounge   
there ll be no hard feelings 
let s play 
 molly 
the game is mine now 
i incorporated and molly bloom
event planning was born 
i paid taxes and 1099 d
my employees 
i never became romantically
or sexually involved
with any of the players 
the game would have
fallen apart 
this was back when i was
still making good decisions 
and i went to a lawyer
to make absolutely sure
all this was legal 
  are you taking a rake 
  no 
then you re not
breaking the law 
  but can i give you advice 
  please 
there s a saying
in my business 
don t break the law
when you re breaking the law 
  what do you mean 
  no drugs  no prostitutes 
no muscle to collect debts 
oh  i don t do
anything like that 
but you just said
i wasn t breaking the law 
you wanna keep it that way
because you don t wanna
break the law when
you re breaking the law 
am i breaking the law 
not really 
we re able to find out
for sure  aren t we 
laws are written down 
you re not taking
a percentage of the pot 
no 
you re running a square game 
 molly 
my game had a tricky ecosystem 
these guys could buy anything 
but here  in this room
you couldn t buy your win 
you couldn t buy me 
you couldn t buy the girls 
and you couldn t buy
a seat at the table 
there s nothing as sweet
as a win you have to work for 
and the wins and loses were
compelling  and they were real 
of course  it helped that the
players were gambling addicts 
can i see you for a second 
 molly 
jay  you re famous 
you are an international
rock star 
oh  i wasn t sure
you d noticed 
you can t send
emails like that 
well  it s not a federal
production  okay 
i just invited you to cabo
for the weekend 
the next woman you send
an email like that to
is not gonna be me 
it s going to be someone else 
you re playing with fire 
i m telling you that
i m in love with you
and you are worried about me
getting blackmailed 
oh  my  that just makes me
more into you 
lemon head  they won t need
to blackmail you 
they can get just as
much money from tmz 
and tmz will give them
what they really want 
tell me the truth 
was mine the first love letter
you ve gotten from a player 
it was the seventh 
all digitally transmitted 
you are begging for
your life to be turned
into a very public hell 
so that s a no on cabo 
why don t you just give your
wife and kids a break
and run  em over with a limo 
i love the way that
you talk to me 
oh  god 
  i ve had a thought 
  yeah 
raise the stakes 
to what 
50k buy in  blinds are 250 500 
  that s a 500 percent hike 
  yeah 
i don t think it s a good idea 
could you guys give me
the room for a second 
sure 
the players that are losing
a  100 000 a week
are gonna be losing
half a million 
the players winning
a  100 000 a week   
will have no one left
to play with 
players are gonna get hurt 
others are gonna get killed 
and some will drop out 
it s not sustainable 
we ll lose the game 
find new players 
 molly 
he meant  find new fish  
i went recruiting again 
first up was donnie silverman 
donnie won the world series
of poker last year
and got in touch with me
through one of the players 
are you fucking nuts 
donnie silverman won
the world series of poker 
you can watch it online 
he took 11 hands
at the final table 
but he had the nuts
on eight of them 
and three of those   
three were two outers with
four players still in the hand 
he ran hot 
he doesn t lock his chips down 
he s reckless 
he gives tons of action
and he s got  12 million 
 instrumental music 
you know 
i don t like playing poker 
why do you play 
i like destroying lives 
give him a chair 
 molly  the next recruit
was brad marion 
who everyone called bad brad
because he was uniquely
terrible at this game 
if there was a worse
player in the world
brad would still find a way
to lose to him 
sorry  i don t have a chair 
but you re welcome to a drink 
no  i just came to
introduce you to  uh  brad   
 male  4 
i m all in  calling it 
  yeah  i call 
  sorry 
i just wanted to introduce
you to brad marion 
  he wants to play 
  give me his information 
  i ll check him out 
  derek s gonna vouch for him 
 derek s gonna vouch for him 
meant derek would cover
any losses if brad didn t pay 
up to any amount 
  hi  i m molly bloom 
  brad marion 
  nice to meet you 
  you too 
 molly 
but he could pay and had to 
because he embraced the fallacy
of being pot committed 
i m all in 
 molly 
you ve already invested so much
you might as well see it
through to the end 
bad brad had raised
 700 million
for a fund that traded
oil futures and every week
he came to the game 
lost a  100 000 and tipped me
five thousand so he could
play the next week 
he wasn t getting any better   
and the guys were
feasting on him 
can i get another 50 
  can we talk for a second 
  sure 
brad  this game might not
be for you 
i know i m no card shark 
no  you re not 
here are your losses
after ten weeks 
and you ve won    never 
it s actually
a statistical anomaly 
yeah  i know 
i like playing with the guys 
i don t have that many friends 
don t take my seat away 
i can tip you more 
no 
your tips are very generous 
how about i i get you
some books 
or even  even a pro
to give you lessons 
yeah  maybe 
  yeah  let me think about it 
  okay 
 molly  turned out bad brad
knew what he was doing 
he was getting customers 
he d drop his
100k at the game
and pick up four million
for his hedge fund 
  tell him what s smart   
  not me 
 molly 
more on that later  but first
harlan eustice 
player x said he met harlan
at the commerce casino
and that he d be
good for the game 
but i wasn t seeing
what he was seeing 
he played tight  folding after
the hole cards 64  of the time 
it wasn t clear
where his money came from 
he produced backyard
wrestling videos
and other low rent productions 
but worst of all
harlan eustice
was a good card player 
why would player x want someone
at the game who could beat him 
i learned the answer
to that one the hard way 
  how was your flight 
  just fine 
how are you paying for tickets
between l a  and new york 
i had two million points
left on my amex 
they took the card 
but let me keep the points 
which i thought
was nice of them 
  you had meetings 
  hmm 
you had meetings in l a 
about your book and life rights 
  i did 
  was there any interest 
a company that owns
four thousand
video poker machines
wants to put my face on them 
anything else 
 treat magazine 
made a generous offer 
   treat  
  it s a new magazine 
for the high end
photography enthusiast 
  they want you to pose naked 
  i d be the april treat 
i meant interest in your book 
ah  yeah 
  any offers 
  a few  i guess 
couple   
five 
  really 
  yeah 
  and   
  i passed 
you re destitute
and you passed on
five offers to turn
your book into a movie 
you will be paid  charlie 
i m just curious as to why
you passed on
what would appear to be
the only way out you have 
creative differences 
  okay 
  should we start 
you know  i am gonna
figure you out 
well  let me know
what you find 
you see this 
this is discovery 
let s see what we discovered 
over here we have
peter druzhinsky
peter antonovich
and peter slobo 
the three petes 
now the three petes run a chain
of corrupt medical clinics
and have been committing
insurance fraud
wire fraud and mail fraud
on an epic scale 
now  over here we have
the ragnyada gershen
organization 
they re a worldwide
bookmaking operation
handling hundreds of millions
of dollars a year
in illegal sports betting 
and over here  we have
the alexander habib
organization 
this is also an illegal
sports betting organization 
but this one 
financed by an art gallery
owned by shillel habib 
who everyone calls   
shelly 
this is the russian mafia
and the three are tied together
in the indictment through   
a poker game 
  were they tapping my phones 
  no 
 molly 
thank god 
they were tapping the phones
of everyone you talked to 
okay 
they got you confirming
that you ran raked games
at the plaza hotel and various
locations in new york 
they ve also got
a confidential informant
confirming that you ran
raked games at the plaza hotel
and various locations
in new york 
you were in violation of 1955 
which is a part of the u s  code
that makes it illegal to run
an illegal gambling business 
you know what you did 
you finished writing a book
before the good part happened 
you really get a kick out
of yourself  don t you 
you know 
i don t like this picture 
  thank you 
  you re like the cat   
that ate the canary
and then told
the canary s
parents about it 
it s the picture
the publisher wanted
and i didn t get a vote 
i liked the book  good story 
  well told 
  thank you 
i need you to tell
it again  though 
from the beginning 
and this time
without skipping over
the russians 
 jaffey  would you
like a glass of water 
i d like a glass of bourbon 
  one more thing 
  yeah 
i need your hard drives 
  going back how far 
  what do you mean 
well  i kept my hard drives
when i d buy a new laptop 
  you re kidding 
  no 
it had a record of who owed what
and spreadsheets on the players 
it has more than that 
every time you charge your phone
by plugging it into the computer
the computer takes a record
of all your text messages
and emails 
my laptop has a record
of all text messages and emails
received years ago on phones
that have been smashed
with an aluminum bat 
i wanna run a forensic imaging
on your hard drives 
oh  no  thanks anyway  but i ll
be destroying those hard drives 
no  you can t do that 
they re evidence 
i m going to blow them up 
i am literally gonna use
explosives and scatter
the remains in the sea 
except you told me they exist 
you re gonna have
to pretend i didn t tell you 
  can t do that 
  yes  you can 
you wanted a lawyer that
wasn t even a little bit shady 
new information
has come to light 
  i see that was stupid 
  molly 
there are no hard drives 
if you destroy evidence
and obstruct justice
on top of the charges
already brought against you
in this case  you will be 
i promise  incarcerated 
you don t understand
what s in those text messages 
i understand you ve had
boyfriends and there ll be
some exchanges that are a little
bit  you know  embarrassing   
i don t care about embarrassing
text messages from boyfriends
as there is not left
the smallest corner
of my private life
that isn t available
for public scrutiny 
there are messages that
would destroy other lives 
there are messages
that would end careers
and obliterate families 
if those the text messages
were to be made public   
  they won t be 
  if they were   
  they won t be 
  it would be catastrophic 
  i m a lawyer  i m legally   
  no 
listen to me 
i am legally prohibited
from disclosing anything   
someone leaked
my last deposition
to the national enquirer 
charlie 
  butterball 
  my last lawyer s name   
was butterman
and he was one of five people
in the room besides me 
but the information
in that deposition
will be nothing compared
to the consequences
of those text messages   
ah  i just got it 
showing up everywhere 
i couldn t figure out why you
named some people
but not others 
i thought that maybe
some people paid you 
you were wrong 
but doesn t matter 
no  the only people you named
in that book were the ones
that were already named in
the bad brad marion deposition 
  which you think   
  i know 
  somebody leaked it 
  sold it 
  to the tabloids 
  yes 
  maybe even butterbean 
  butterman 
but i don t know who it was 
i watched jenny mccarthy
beat you up
for naming the players 
why didn t you just say 
 hey  those names
are already public record  
i don t know   cause i wasn t
on  the view  under subpoena 
can we please get back
to the emails and texts 
is that why you have
creative differences
with the hollywood offers 
because they want information
and you won t give them 
  i don t know you 
  hm 
if what happened last time
were to happen this time
it would make
what happened last time   
what is this for 
it s got every text message
and email
i sent in the last year
as well as a variety
of incriminating evidence
about my clients 
now if anything
of yours get leaked
you can sell my phone
to the highest bidder
and i ll lose my job
and get disbarred 
so in order to demonstrate
the sanctity
of your attorney client
confidentiality
you re betraying
the confidentiality
of all your other clients 
i know you re not
gonna look at it 
how do you know 
i don t know 
i ll fly home to colorado   
and be back the next day
with the hard drives 
 molly 
harlan eustice was excited
about the surprise
40th birthday party
he was throwing for
his wife in 24 hours 
i rented out the whole
courtyard of the buffalo club 
it ll be about a hundred people 
kumamoto oysters 
snow crab  lobsters 
 molly  he wasn t taking off
menu items to show off 
he was genuinely excited
about the party
he was giving his wife 
she doesn t know
anything about it 
she thinks we re having dinner
with her brother and his wife 
 molly 
i liked harlan 
but nobody else liked him
except player x 
  he played tight 
  fold
didn t give a lot of action
and always got
his money in good 
which means he was
running the odds 
  five thousand to call 
  no 
 molly  in other words 
he was playing poker 
and the others were gambling 
and he won 
by midnight  harlan had
tripled his original
fifty thousand dollar buy in 
but everything came off
the rails with one hand 
and that s how it happens 
that s how you go full tilt 
harlan  the best player
at the table
the best player at most
tables was about to get
bluffed off the win by 
of all people   
bad brad  how 
because harlan had never
played with brad before
and didn t know yet
that brad was bad 
harlan s got a boat 
9 s full 
brad s got nothing 
but his pre flop
betting made it look
entirely accidently 
like there was
a chance he had pocket kings 
twenty thousand 
 molly 
which if true
would give him
the better full house 
brad s counting off  20 000 
which means he s going to call
and harlan knows that if
brad s gonna call and not raise
it means he didn t
have the boat 
and he s betting
a high two pair 
probably kings and queens 
but then instead
of calling the bet
brad pushes  72 000
into the pot 
i m all in 
 molly 
harlan looks at brad 
every tell harlan knows about
carotid artery pumping 
stiff hands   
brad s doing the opposite 
brad s betting represented
a huge hand
by calling on the flop
check raising the turn
and bombing the river 
of course  harlan didn t know
that brad didn t know
what any of that meant 
so harlan  always
a good sport said   
nice bet  i m laying this down 
 molly  as he tossed in what he
didn t realize was the winning hand
brad tosses in his cards too
and one of them flips
over and harlan sees   
you didn t have pocket kings 
i didn t have any kings
except the one in the middle 
  you had two pair 
  i had one pair 
the nines in the middle 
thank you 
 molly  it wasn t even that
it was that much money 
harlan only lost
about  40 000 on the hand 
but a circuit breaker blew
and harlan was
out for blood now 
everyone s 
 molly  we have a
 112 000 on the table 
you want another 50 
give me another 100  please 
 upbeat music 
sign here for a 100 000 
 molly  by 5 a m   harlan
was down half a million 
he d abandoned everything
he knew about poker
and was playing
like a frat kid
swinging for a home run
on every hand 
  another 100 please 
  hey  bud   
molly  please  let s go 
 molly 
sign here for a 100 
 molly  text messages were going
out letting everyone know
harlan was bleeding 
guys were coming by to play
for a couple hours before work 
they d been losing
to him for months 
everyone wanted a check
from harlan eustice 
if you go home now you can have
a few hours sleep
before sheila s party 
soon 
come talk to me 
hi  guys 
help yourself to some coffee 
you re on tilt 
everybody knows it 
you re playing
without the weapons
you need to win 
you re right 
alright  thank you 
just give me  500 000 
i just gotta get back to even 
 molly 
that should be the second line
of every gambler s obit 
mr  feldstein died while
trying to get back to even 
harlan never did 
and he never got to his wife s
birthday party 
she filed for divorce
two days later 
there was one last punch coming
that would put harlan
on the floor for good 
harlan was heads up against
a guy named frederick
who was austrian royalty 
call 
harlan had pocket queens 
his excellency had ace king 
they were both in 65k pre flop 
flops queen seven seven 
harlan has a full house again 
queens full of sevens 
with three rounds of betting
in front of him   
the count has nothing 
  all in 
  and the count goes all in 
he wants harlan
to think he s got
two more sevens under there 
  call 
   nope   says harlan 
he s not falling for this again
and he snap calls all in 
there s  750 000 on the table 
diego burns a card
and deals a turn 
a king  otto von bismarck
now has two pair 
kings and sevens 
but two pair is nothing
next to a full house 
and at this point
the only hand left that can
beat a queen full house   
is a king full house 
captain von trapp
bluffed two pair
and rivered into kings full 
motherfucker 
motherfucker 
  fuck you  fucking mechanic 
  hey 
fuck you  you bottom dealing
party magician 
hey  get out on the terrace 
you ve been pulling this shit
on me for two days 
  come on  come on 
  party magician 
  you good 
  i m okay  thanks 
 molly 
what the hell 
i ll apologize to diego 
yeah  and you re gonna go home 
i m making a floor call 
that s it 
did you hear me 
i don t have it 
a million two 
i don t have it 
i m sorry 
go home 
i m very sorry 
you got to tell
sheila the truth  okay 
tell her the truth 
tell her what happened 
and i m gonna help you 
i m gonna get you to a meeting 
we ll meet tomorrow
and figure out
what to do about the money 
 molly  harlan and i
didn t meet the next day 
he just called me
and said everything was okay
and showed up the next week
with a bank check
for a million  two hundred
thousand dollars 
 molly  where did he
get the money from 
  i loaned it to him 
  loaned it 
i get 50  of his wins
until the debt s paid off 
and then fifty percent for the
next two years with no exposure 
you re getting 50  of the wins 
  and no exposure on the losses 
  yeah 
first of all  he ll never
climb out of that 
that s sharecropper math 
it s also usury 
it s racketeering 
second  you can t
stake a player
and play in the game
at the same time 
i ve been doing it
for two years 
  you ve been staking harlan 
  yeah 
  jesus christ 
  it s not cheating 
it creates
the opportunity for it 
  tell me how 
  are you kidding me 
  tell me how 
  you ve interest in another   
you think i m going
to take a dive 
and if i did  who would care 
you fold your hole cards 
five of clubs 
and a jack of hearts 
he s still in the game 
it would benefit him to know
that the five of clubs   
you think i m signaling him 
i m saying it can t
fucking happen again 
  you disapprove of me 
  it s not personal 
it feels personal
when you chat up
every other guy
at the game except me 
when you stay late for a drink
with j t  but never   
have you visited his oscar 
i think it s bolted
on the hood of his car 
it s noticeable 
when you go out of your way
to demonstrate that you
have no interest in me 
you did the same thing to dean 
these guys want to play cards
with me  not you 
be that as it may   
you know who the biggest
winner in this game is 
  it s you 
  you know who   
the second biggest winner is 
  look   
  it s you 
what are you taking home 
10 000 a night now 
that is my business 
literally 
between you  the dealers
and the servers
you re taking a lot of money
out of this game 
not as much
as i m bringing to it 
that 10 000 is 10 000
that doesn t go in my pocket 
again  my money is   
your money is my money 
is it 
i think we should talk
about capping your tips 
you want to get together
with the other players
who on my tax returns 
are called clients
and discuss putting
a ceiling on my wages 
that s right 
it ll be america s most closely
watched anti trust case 
 molly 
right there  right then
that fast  i lost the game 
it was the next tuesday 
game night 
he waited until he knew
i d be on the way to the hotel
and then sent me a text 
it said   we re playing
at dave s tonight 
no need to show up  
and i knew the truth
even before i answered
the call that came next 
 player x laughing 
you are so fucked 
 instrumental music 
there s no such word
as verticality 
  hmm 
  in the book  on page 152 
 when you lose the game in l a 
and come to new york
you admire
the city s verticality  
it s a word 
once you re in new york
you talk about games
lasting all night  two nights 
bein  up for days 
but you don t mention drugs 
there were drugs 
i m two years clean 
but you left the drugs
out of the book 
you know what 
i m not paying you  250 000
for your amazon
customer review 
so far  you re not
paying me for anything 
i just emailed you
verticality
from merriam webster s
dictionary 
what s an advance
on a book like this 
the advance 
it depends 
 eli 
if you guarantee the publishers
certain elements
then i can get you
a million and a half 
which you d probably
double on sales
plus ancillary rights 
what kind of elements 
  you have to use real names 
  eli   
there s a guy who sits
outside my starbucks
with a  uh 
with a cardboard sign
that says  vietnam vet  
and every morning 
i give him a quarter 
and right now 
the only difference
between you and him
is that you have
a story 
i m one thousand
percent sure that
the homeless vietnam vet
has a better one 
you have one asset 
write your story
and i can get you
a million and a half 
and and that s the floor 
go big or go home
and live with your mother 
for the rest of your life 
what if i   
what if i told the publishers
that i i would name the players
who are already named in
the brad marion deposition 
all four 
i ll use the real names
of the players
who are already
named by bad brad 
  what if i told them that 
  you spent eight years   
in hollywood and
two years in new york
running the world s
most exclusive
glamorous and decadent
man cave 
 eli  so what do the
publishers get from you
about people with real names 
my advance was  35 000 
well  the first thing
i m gonna do is
get you a minor role reduction 
get the 12 points
knocked down to ten 
  what s a minor role reduction 
  i m going to argue   
to the prosecutor that you re 
uh  an employee that was
hired and fired
by the players 
  not a chance 
  i think we got a good chance 
no  not a chance i m letting
you make that argument 
  why not 
  it s not true 
let me explain how
the point system works 
i know how it works 
points correspond
with the prosecutor s
sentencing recommendation 
you try to get a point reduction
based on a variety of factors
including  say 
prior criminal history
which i don t have 
or whether the defendant
played a minor role 
which i certainly did not 
you really think this is
a good time to hog credit 
  i built it from scratch 
  no 
there was already a game
at the cobra lounge
when you came along 
the new york game is
what i m talking about 
i built from scratch 
i wasn t fireable 
i made sure of that 
so  no 
i wasn t really listening 
i m refusing you permission
to seek a minor role reduction 
i m refusing you permission
to invalidate
my entire career 
  and i m not caring 
  i built a successful   
hey  do you want kids 
you interested
in having a family 
very much 
i don t get you
some point reductions
and the sentencing
recommendation guidelines
say eight to twelve years 
and that s before they
try to jam you up
more for money laundering 
the moment you changed the
russian s money for chips   
i would ve had to been aware
where the money was   
find me twelve men and women
who ll believe
that you weren t aware
of exactly who was sitting
at your table
and where the money came from 
so  that s it 
you were a cocktail waitress 
 molly  when i lost the l a  game 
i told myself it was no big deal 
it was just supposed
to be an adventure
and a way to meet
influential people 
and i d saved over  200 000 
but that was just a weak
firewall i d hastily built
to keep out the humiliation
and depression
i knew was coming 
it had to end sometime 
i just thought
it would be on my time 
the game had given me
an identity
respect and a defined place
in a world
that was inaccessible 
and in one irrational
heartbeat  it was taken away 
i was irrelevant   
and forgotten  overnight 
it d been two weeks
since i lost the game   
and i made an appointment
to see someone 
because now 
the humiliation and depression
had given way
to a blinding anger
at my powerlessness
over the unfair whims of men 
it was that
there weren t any rules 
these power moves weren t
framed by right and wrong 
just ego and vanity 
selfish whims with
no regard for consequence 
no fairness  no justice 
and that giggling 
cackling call from player x 
 player x giggling 
you re so fucked 
i couldn t lose to that
green screened little shit 
and i didn t want a therapist
to make me feel okay about it 
you know what makes you feel
okay about losing 
winning 
i got on a plane to new york 
 instrumental music 
wall street  madison avenue 
fifth avenue  the dakota 
the san remo 
the players were here 
i just had to bait the hook 
this time 
i didn t have movie stars 
this time 
i used playboy playmates 
these weren t
just any playmates 
jesse was
a puerto rican knockout
who grew up working
in card rooms
and was a good player herself 
i could stake her 
infiltrate other games
and poach
their big ticket players 
shelby could write code
and run more thorough
background checks
than the t s a 
winston was the daughter
of an american diplomat 
she s lived in nine
different countries
and had the email addresses
of half
the saudi royal family 
 molly  who s the biggest
game in manhattan 
on any given night  it s either
teddy chin or tutti toscano 
  but that s manhattan 
  what do you mean 
biggest game in new york
is in brooklyn 
russian jews 
buy in s a 100k 
no one runs the game 
they just play and pay 
we couldn t promise anyone
they d rub elbows
with movie stars 
but new york has one thing
hollywood doesn t 
the yankees 
and there was one
yankee in particular
that every man in america
would line up to lose to 
don t say his name out loud 
write it on a cocktail napkin 
crumple up the napkin up 
put it in a glass of water
so they can see
the ink dissolve 
  that s really necessary 
  no 
it s not at all necessary 
when do we tell them the game
is going to start 
tell them it s been happening
once a week for about six months
at a location you won t
disclose right now 
there s a pretty long
waiting list for a chair
but molly s here somewhere
and i ll introduce you to her 
50k buy in 
blinds are five and one 
yeah  fifty   
mol 
50k buy in 
no  250 
that s going to make noise 
enough to be
heard on rodeo drive 
 instrumental music 
 molly 
the gold coast of long island
has been home
to the vanderbilts
roosevelts  whitneys
j p  morgan
and f w  woolworth 
it s an impossible ticket
to get  but i can talk to molly 
 molly  tonight was a  10 000
per person fundraiser
to pay for major renovations
at the east hampton yacht club 
molly s around here somewhere 
i could introduce you  but i
wouldn t get my hopes up 
 molly 
that s for real 
there was a charity event
for residents of the hamptons
who own yachts 
in my business  that s called
a target rich environment 
i have to tell you
the initial buy in is  250 000 
 250 000  that s almost as much
as my second car 
your friends come to the games 
mm hm 
 molly 
it took only 7 weeks
of recruiting to get 10 players
and 7 on a waiting list 
and in these circles
that was more than enough
to start the mythology 
by morning 
gamblers would be telling
and hearing stories
about this game in london
tokyo and dubai 
at the end of that year
i reported an income
of  4 773 000 
every square inch of it
legal and on the books 
i was the biggest game runner
in the world 
all tips 
i still hadn t taken a rake
and i still hadn t accidentally
recruited members
of a russian crime syndicate 
in the beginning  i was using
drugs to stay awake 
first adderall 
then adderall crushed up
to defeat the time release 
then coke  valium  vicodin
percocet and more adderall 
i rented a penthouse apartment
and installed plasma screens
for the sports bettors 
i had the lower stakes
games on wednesdays
thursdays and sundays
at my place
with tuesday night at
the plaza being the big game 
at 7 00  the dealers came
and the table was set up
and polished
and ten chairs
were placed around it
exactly 12 inches apart 
i used custom chips
and two dealers
who worked an hour on 
an hour off
with a new crew coming in
after 12 hours 
casinos had discovered
that certain scents
make people more likely
to place big bets 
the casinos pump those scents
in through the ventilation 
i had custom candles made 
i d been working
with a new dealer named  b  
not like beatrice 
just the initial 
she d been working in
trashy card rooms
on the east side
and we became friends 
tone it down 
the big players
don t like fast hands 
sarcastic dealing  cool 
you got to do it 
not doing it is insanity 
you must be able to see that 
you ve been stiffed four
or five times 
you ve got hundreds of thousands
on the street 
that s money you re
never gonna see again 
 molly  b had been suggesting
it for a long time 
she was suggesting it again
because of an incident
the week before 
  hey  cole 
  hey 
  come on in 
  thanks  you got my check 
 molly 
i do 
  it s right here 
  thank you 
hey can i show you
something on tv 
umm  actually 
i m in kinda a hurry 
it ll just take a second 
have a seat 
this is last tuesday s game 
shit  molly 
if the guys find out
you ve got cameras on them 
they re gonna go nuts 
yeah  that s you
in the seventh chair 
look at your stack of chips 
i ve got a cab downstairs   
look at the time stamp 
1 06 a m 
 molly 
let s fast forward to 1 07 
1 07 
you lose a hand to boosty 
  what is this 
  1 08 
our sheets say that
you didn t buy in again
between 1 06 and 1 08 
but look at that 
your stack s bigger 
  i can explain  it s just  uh   
  okay  let s rewind 
this screen s got
the dealer changeover
while at the same time 
on this screen
and    there we are 
this is why i can t reconcile
 57 000 from tuesday s game 
a 7 11 s got security cameras
on their slushy machine 
i ve got a million
dollars changing hands
every two minutes  imbecile 
you don t think
i ve got eyes on the table 
relax 
i  uh  i owe people money 
i know  why isn t it coming
from the trust fund 
i need my parents  permission
to get that much 
and they d kill me  you don t
even understand what it s like 
people don t realize
trust fund kids 
are suffering
in this economy  too 
i realize what i did was wrong 
did it take a lot of soul
searching to get you there 
okay  okay  first of all
the guys that are making
the counterfeit chips
are taking you for a ride 
they know that
there are signatures
built into the chips 
exact weight  infrared markings 
breathe  second 
don t try this
at anyone else s game
because if you do 
they are going to express
their anger in a much different
way than i am 
you owe me  57 000 
when i get it  you get the tape
but until then
you don t play in anyone s game 
 molly  so when tuesday night
came  b was at it again 
your exposure s crazy 
it s not if  it s when 
you re gonna get blown up 
your risk is nuts 
if i took a rake  this game
would no longer be legal 
and if you can t cover 
this game will no longer exist 
you re the bank now 
you re guaranteeing the game 
if you see a hand
you don t want to carry
just look at me
flash me a number
and i ll take it off the table 
most runners cap it
at five percent 
  i ll see you out there 
  see you out there 
 molly 
two weeks later  around 2 a m 
there was a pot that was up to
 1 3 million  pre flop
with five players still in 
my hope was that the flop
would chase four of them off 
 male  5 
 200 000 
raise a  100 000 
   300 000 to you  sir 
  call 
 molly  there was now 2 1
million on the table 
 300 000 to you  sir 
plus 200 
 molly 
 2 6 million 
three million 
she was right 
i was extending credit 
big numbers 
and it s not like
harlan eustice hadn t already
put the fear of god into me 
if i couldn t pay one time
that d be the end of the game 
i was the house 
that s how quickly
i made the decision 
and just as quickly  b
calculated 2 percent of the pot
and took it off the table 
that was it 
i had just taken a rake
in violation of
u s  criminal code  1955 
it s time to introduce
douglas downey
 cause downey s gonna
take us all the way home 
downey was a drunk 
and he d stay after the game
and hang out
while i did the books 
he was hard to understand
when he was drunk
and his conversation openers
would always sound like
the title of a detective novel 
victim of circumstance 
yeah 
story of  you know   
story of my proverbial 
you know   
  life 
  life 
 molly 
he d talk about his marriage 
i married young  mol 
i married young
and i married dull 
if i d been born in greenwich
instead of flushing   
 molly  he talked about
wanting a better life 
new canaan   
gone to    rye country day
princeton   
the life i d have 
the wife i d have 
i d be a player 
victim of circumstance 
mol  these are things
i only say to you 
good call 
 molly 
and he d talk about another
game he played in 
it was the brooklyn game 
the brighton beach game
where they played all night
and all day 
the game that was
populated by russians 
i m the only irish guy

mol  these are the nicest
guys i ve ever met

okay  douglas  focus up 
yes  there s a book
by james joyce called  ulysses 
and there s a character

but now it s time
to move past that

carrying a monet 
i was driven and i have security
outside the door 
okay  shelly 
here s what i need you to do 
i need you to get this   
  what  four 
  seven 
 molly 
seven million dollar
painting out of here right now 
  and you re  i assume  armed 
  sure 
 molly  security can t stand
in front of the door 
fix this up  come on back
and i ll extend you credit
tonight up to one and a half 
you re a very
beautiful woman 
please be careful
with the painting 
always 
 molly  mike  illya 
alexei and shelly 
those were the players
doug downey brought me 
as advertised 
they played loose  gave action
lost to the regulars
and settled right away 
people have asked 
 wasn t there any way to tell
 that some of the players
at your game were connected
 to one of the darkest 
deadliest
and far reaching organized
crime syndicates in the world  
no  there wasn t 
i m gonna go all in 
 instrumental music 
 charlie sighs 
i wish i had better news 
harrison wellstone didn t go
for the minor role reduction 
no 
he didn t buy that
i was a cocktail waitress 
  no 
  aww  is it because i wasn t 
hey  i tried  which is what
you re not paying me to do 
so what now 
the government
is expressing an interest
in you being
a cooperating witness 
  you don t say 
  molly 
who could ve possibly seen that
coming 
  let s have the conversation 
  it will be short 
because i don t know anything
at all that can help them 
you don t know anything that can
help them convict
the russians  but you
know things that can help them 
did you know that
97 percent of federal cases
never make it to trial 
even though the chances
of being convicted
at trial is a little more than
one in a hundred 
if you want to go
to trial  that s fine 
but it s gonna cost you
in the area of  3 500 000
which the justice department
knows i don t have
because they took
all of my money
in a civil forfeiture
which they can do
without a warrant 
because my property
doesn t have a presumption
of innocence 
then after i m arrested
by 17 agents
holding automatic weapons 
totally necessary
not at all meant
to intimidate me 
i m given two days
to hire a lawyer
and appear in a courtroom on
the other side of the country 
if you re saying
that everything that happens
from the moment
you are arrested is designed
to persuade you to plead guilty 
you are correct 
so tell me all the ways
i can help
 cause i really feel
i owe it to them 
oh  speaking of owing
the irs put a tax lien
on the money they took from me 
are you ki    alright 
none of that matters 
taking my money wasn t a tax
i also need
to give them my money 
  or they will take it again 
  none of that matters 
  it needed to be said 
  not really 
so  to be clear  you re not
interested in entering
a cooperation agreement
with the prosecutors 
if i had testimony that would
lead to the conviction
of a bad guy  no one would have
to coerce me into cooperating 
but i don t  i have dirt 
i have dish  i have gossip 
so my value to the prosecution
is exactly the same
as it is to hollywood 
i m here to ensure the
new york post covers the trial 
i m here to sell tickets 
which is nonetheless
value to the prosecution 
so what we do
is leverage it to get
you a favorable sentencing
recommendation
or  better yet 
complete immunity  what 
oh  hey  honey 
  hey  stella 
  hey 
hey 
what does he have you doing now 
an essay on three poems
with what he believes
are a common theme 
not an essay  two paragraphs 
  which three poems 
  close  rush and walls 
oh  i know those 
what s the common theme 
things with one word titles 
are you sure you re qualified
to be teaching poetry 
hang on    and yes 
anytime you wanna run away from
home  you can come live with me 
 charlie  then you ll discover
she doesn t have a home
and you ll come back to me 
this is good  great 
why don t you grab a snack
and start your homework
in one of the conference rooms 
okay  see ya 
there s no law that says you
can t just hit him in the head 
there is a law that says that 
it s the first thing
i taught her to read 
go 
 door closes 
my father used
to give us extra work 
can i ask you a question 
you think i m too hard on her 
i met a girl when i first moved
to l a   she was 22 
someone arranged through
a third party
to spend the weekend
with her in london 
you know what she got 
for a weekend  five grand 
a bag  a chanel bag she wanted 
whatever you re doing
with stella  double it 
where s your father in all this 
you mean  physically 
he s in colorado 
your parents still together 
no 
you and your father close 
no 
was he tough on you 
you know how many girls
at the olympics
have demanding fathers 
  all of them 
  well  that s right 
i was tough on him 
what do you mean 
um   
i was a brat 
 charlie 
fathers don t care 
  i d start fights with him 
  why 
 charlene 
you re lying 
 molly  why would i
start fights with him 
 charlie 
yeah 
 charlene 
i put you through grad school 
i raised the kids 
i did every    god  everything 
no 
no  you listen to me 
all you do is cheat on me 
and lie to me
and lie to the kids 
you lie to your wife
and you lie to your kids 
i don t know 
for the record  the law in 1955
that i m accused of breaking it 
defines gambling as betting
on games of chance 
  yes 
  poker isn t a game of chance 
roulette s a game of chance 
  poker s a game of skill 
  still  i me   
i ll tell them everything
they want to know about me 
about me 
that s it 
 molly 
remember bad brad marion 
it turns out his  700 000 000
hedge fund
wasn t what you would
call    real 
it was a ponzi scheme 
he d been falsely reporting
profits for years 
he wasn t even registered
with the sec 
with the money given to him
by friends and family
and players at the game 
he bought several
malibu beach houses
an airplane hanger
full of cars
another one with an airplane 
and a life he wanted 
when he was arrested 
he had  740 in the bank 
brad cooperated with the fbi
and gave them hours
of testimony
on a range of subjects 
including how three years
earlier
he lost  5 200 000
in an underground
celebrity poker game
that was run by a girl
named molly bloom 
his story was that
i had induced him
to play in a high stakes game 
i just wanted to introduce you
to brad marion 
 molly 
and that due to my enabling
he d become a gambling addict 
   who made me
become a gambling addict 
brad  this game might
not be for you 
 molly 
federal bankruptcy lawyers
were brought in to recover
as much
of the boosted money
as they could 
i was sent a subpoena and flew
out to l a  to be deposed 
can you confirm
the names on the list
all played poker
with brad marion 
this list was provided
to you by brad marion 
i just need you
to confirm for the record
that your game included
but was not limited to   
i understand  what i m trying
to get on the record is that
i m not the one
who provided the list 
these names were provided
by brad marion 
 female  3 
so  under oath   
yes  i can confirm
the list is accurate 
 molly  the l a  players
and i were given a choice 
testify against each other
in open court
or help make restitution to the
victims of brad s ponzi scheme 
i wrote the government
a check for  500 000 dollars 
and somewhere in an fbi field
office in new york
someone was pinning
my picture to a wall 
i was running six games a week
sometimes at two different
locations in a night 
and by this point 
i was addicted to drugs 
adderall  ambien  xanax  coke 
alcohol  valium 
ativan  trazadone 
anything that could keep me up
for a few days
and knock me out
for a few hours 
but i wasn t just taking them
to stay awake anymore 
it was dark and friendless
where i was 
i felt like i was in a hole
so deep  i could go fracking 
it didn t feel like depression 
it felt more violent 
 indistinct chatter 
i was tired of living
in the frat house
i d built for degenerates 
i was tired of the greed 
mine  not theirs  everybody s 
i was sick
of being high all the time 
i was sick
of living in the grey area 
i couldn t recognize myself
and what i recognized 
i couldn t stand 
after a game one night 
douglas downey surprised me
with a confession 
after opening
with another
detective story title 
gut shot on the river 
  i want to say something 
  okay 
  i want to say  um  something 
  okay 
  i m just gonna say   
  cool 
because there s a poem 
a famous  uh   
a poem about   
thoughts left unexpressed 
two roads emerged
from the woods 
do they explode 
i don t know 
do you like poetry 
i did until a second ago 
i m gonna call you   
i m  i m in love with you 
  this isn t happening 
  plain and simple 
you re the woman
i ve always dreamed of
and i ve been dreaming   
shh  stop it 
listen to me  douglas 
i m the woman all of you
have always dreamed of 
i m the anti wife 
i encourage your gambling 
i have drinks served
to you by models
who simultaneously
create the impression
that you re the kind of guy
who can score
a dime piece anytime you want 
it s nice for you in here 
do you know who circe was 
  uh   
  circe 
used to play
in teddy chin s game 
nope  circe did not play
in teddy s game 
she was the greek goddess
of magic 
and she gave men feasts
with wine and honey
and then turned them into swine 
  why 
  fantastic question 
i would never do that to you 
missed the point by miles 
but that s okay 
oh 
um  molly 
shelby and winston
will close up 
i ll see you next week 
here you go 
thanks a lot  randy 
thanks  molly 
  good morning 
  morning  pat 
 molly 
pat was my driver and security 
  straight home 
  yeah 
 molly  we didn t know
much more about each other
than we needed to know 
but i liked him 
we were friends 
i used to be
a competitive athlete 
i didn t know if you knew that 
what sport 
skiing 
freestyle 
 pat 
were you good 
i don t know 
  hey  molly 
  pat asked me a favor 
 molly  he said there were a
couple of hedge fund guys
in new jersey
who wanted to play
and he could score points
with them if he was able
to get them a meeting with me 
i said   sure   and set
the meeting
for 5 p m  on a thursday
at the four seasons bar 
knowing that if they were legit
they d recognize someone
in the crowd at happy hour
at the four seasons right after
the closing bell 
it turns out i didn t
need to be that clever 
these weren t finance guys 
they were from the cast
of  jersey boys  
they looked around the bar
self consciously 
they were out of their element 
and tough guys
try to look tougher
when they re insecure 
i had a good hunch
what they wanted
and i was gonna have
to shut down
this meeting quickly 
but without being rude
to joey bag a donuts
and secaucus sal 
i m molly bloom 
nice to meet you 
  john g 
  and you are 
paul 
 john g  
how do we get a drink 
 molly  i don t remember
what the other guy ordered
but i ll never forget
what john g had 
he looked at the waiter
as if to say
that he could handle
himself just fine
among the manhattan elite
and said   
i ll have an appletini 
  okay 
  so  how was your week 
my week  uh  it was fine 
thank you 
pat said you guys might
be interested in a game 
we want to partner
with you 
  we ve talked to tutti  will   
  teddy chin 
teddy chin 
we did a little work
with them too 
we can make
your life easier 
nobody will fuck with you 
nobody will stiff you 
i appreciate the offer 
but really  i m fine 
i don t carry a big debt sheet 
i feel safe 
ah uh  you lied just then
when you said you don t carry
a big debt sheet 
you ve got 2 8 million
on the street right now
right as we re sitting here 
we do our research 
that money should be
in your hands 
 cause it s yours  it s yours 
and if you don t have it 
you got
to go into your pocket
to pay the wins 
fellas  i m sorry 
it s just a friendly game
with higher stakes 
it was really nice
to meet you though 
let me know if there s ever
anything i can do for you 
i like to do favors 
they ll put your drinks
on my card 
 molly  there are some
gaps in my memory
which they say is common
when you ve had
what s called  an event 
for instance  i don t remember
where i was
coming from when i walked
into my building 
just that my doorman  reggie 
said he had packages for me 
ms  bloom  i think
i got some things
for you in the package room 
  i ll bring them on up 
  thanks 
 molly  it was the first
night of two weeks off
for christmas and new year s 
and my plan was to take a bath
and try not to take drugs 
reggie came up
with my packages 
 intense music 
ahh  i m sorry 
you re in the wrong   
wait  okay  hold on a second 
i have   
not a sound 
do you hear me 
i have money  it s all cash 
  where 
  s safe 
where is it 
  it s in the closet 
  show me 
put the money
and jewelry in a bag 
 dramatic music 
gold bars too 
come on 
open your mouth 
open your mouth 
it wasn t an offer they made 
it wasn t a suggestion 
this will be
your only reminder 
your mother lives alone
in telluride  colorado  right 
right  right  molly 
she doesn t live there anymore 
yes  she does 
 molly  i couldn t call a
doctor or go to an e r 
they d take one look at me
and call the police 
my eyes were swollen and black 
my lips were cut and bloody 
i couldn t feel my face 
 instrumental music 
pat had set up the meeting
and he was how they knew
where i lived 
i stayed in my apartment
for two weeks
waiting for my face to heal   
and waiting for the phone call
i knew was coming 
but the call didn t come 
where was the call from john g 
 so maybe you ve had
a change of heart  
after ten days  i opened my
front door for the first time 
people were coming back into
town after new years in cabo
and st  bart s 
and south beach 
my phone was blowing up with 
 when s the next game  
but nothing from john g 
and then right there
on the front page
of the new york times
from eight days ago   
nearly a 125 arrested
in sweeping mob roundup 
those guys
were either laying low
or they were in custody 
sometimes god happens fast 
my face had healed enough 
so that a little make up
would cover the bruises
that were left 
i put together
a week of games 
one week of games to get
the 2 8 million i was owed
and then i was out  i was done 
one week of epic games 
i had some of my
london players in town
and the russians had
visiting friends from moscow 
jesse and shelby had already
started the game at the plaza
and were reporting
heavy early action 
i was on my way
when the phone rang 
it was douglas downey 
i m on my way  doug 
 douglas 
wait  molly  wait 
i m hiding in the bathroom 
i just    i i need you
to believe me  okay 
  i just   
  whose bathroom 
i need you to believe me
because  uh   
uh  at the suite  at the plaza 
why are you hiding
in the bathroom 
i would never tell them
anything about you 
i said   guys 
you want me to go further
 you want me to go other
places  i ll do it 
 but nothing about molly 
she can t be touched 
  just the russians  
  okay  you re drunk 
and a little difficult
to understand
so i ll see you in a few minutes
when i get there 
i was  uh   
i was    uh   
i was cited
for securities fraud 
it was scrubbed from my record 
  that s why you don t know 
  did you say securities fraud 
i would never help them
build a case against you
i would have never give them
anything against you
i d commit perjury
before i did that 
it was such bullshit 
it was 2006 
if you d had an arrest 
i would ve known 
  it was bullshit 
  doug 
i told them i ll go further
i ll go other places 
but not you 
i love you  i  i love   
doug  listen  i i need you to
pull it together for a second 
did they scrub your record 
because you ve been informing 
should i   
should i have told you 
that s a question that ll 
that ll haunt me for all my   
why are you hiding
in the bathroom 
   for my days  molly 
always know that i was
trying to protect you 
 molly  five blocks away 
the fbi had raided my game 
i fully expected the lobby
to be filled
with guys wearing windbreakers 
but it wasn t 
 reggie  ms  bloom  haven t
seen you for a while 
  yeah 
  you need a cab 
i guess you never made it
upstairs with the packages 
maybe i didn t tip you enough
before christmas 
 harrison  then you got into
a cab  took the cab to jfk
and flew to your mother s house
in denver 
 molly 
telluride 
my mother lives in telluride 
  that was two years ago 
  mm hmm 
in a cab on the way
to the airport
i checked
my bank account balance 
there should ve had a little
over four million dollars
but instead  it said the balance
was zero  and there was a note
telling me to contact
the justice department 
i just want to mention that she
also voluntarily checked herself
into 28 day rehab and has been
sober and clean for two years 
i don t care  were the women
that worked for you call girls 
no  sir 
they never exchanged
sex for money 
no 
have you ever exchanged
sex for money 
  no 
  i think he was talking to me 
i meant  no  she s not
answering that question 
  the purpose of this meeting   
  i know 
  purpose of this meeting   
  we re off the record 
we re not off the record 
do you see
a stenographer in here 
we re off the record in
as much as there is no record
but you re free to use
the information you re given
and we re not giving
the information for free 
i ve been sitting at this table
for five hours
waiting for the opportunity
to implore you to do
the right thing while begging my
client for the last three weeks
to act in her own
best interest 
neither of those things
should be hard 
the purpose of this meeting
is for you to meet molly bloom
and discover  as i have 
that she s not the person
the press has invented 
she s not under
federal indictment
for getting bad press  charlie
and the purpose of the meeting 
for me is to discover
if your client is willing to
cooperate with the government
in putting away
some bad people 
no 
you re not willing to cooperate 
uh  no  i never traded
sex for money 
i m still not sure if there s
a record but if there is
i want it to be certain
that was in it 
it appears to me throughout
your career as a game runner
you were extremely diligent
about vetting players 
i was 
but you let four guys
play in the game
without knowing
they were connected 
yeah  plus an fbi informant 
it s embarrassing 
i was high
at the end and   
doing my job badly 
i ll also add that in my limited
experience with the russian mob
they don t immediately
present themselves as mobsters 
my experience with the italian
mob on the other hand   
help us 
i don t know anything
that can help you 
  yes  yes  you do 
  and if i did   
you can provide color 
you can paint a picture 
you can tell us druzhinsky
wore a  100 000
patek philippe
and even drove a phantom 
you can tell us illya gershen
showed up
with a quarter million dollars
cash in a backpack and you can
tell us how much action shelly
was taking on a sports bet 
no one was allowed to place
sports bets inside the room 
they would have to go outside 
so i had no idea how much
anyone was taking or laying 
so now you re saying
you knew they were making
and taking sports bets 
that s the point of them
going outside 
they could have been calling
their mother for all i knew 
  molly 
  yes  sir 
i don t believe you 
in mike davidoff s phone
intercepts alone
just davidoff  your
name comes up 19 times 
we need molly    get
molly    bring molly   
it strongly suggests
that you were important
to his business  so it s hard
for me to believe
that someone with your savvy
and obvious intellect   
talking about the drug   
get molly    bring molly   
we need molly   
it s    they re talking
about the drug ecstasy 
shit  my office is next to yours
for two years
and i ve seen you make
some bone headed moves
but i ve never seen
any prosecutor
step in it
the way you just did 
you should thank
all of the gods that
there is no physical evidence
of that exchange 
  hey  look 
  no  you look 
weren t you going to implore me
to do the right thing 
this woman does not belong
in a rico indictment 
are you out of your minds 
she does not belong
in a mob indictment 
she raked a game  that s it 
for seven months  two years ago 
and why  because she was giving
credit in the millions
and she didn t want to use
muscle to collect 
she has had opportunity after
opportunity to greatly benefit
herself by just telling
the real stories that she knows 
okay  i have the forensic
imaging going back to 2007 
and i m talking
about text messages  emails
movie stars  rock stars 
athletes  billionaires
all explicit 
some married with kids
and that s just
the tip of the iceberg 
what about the guy
that comes this close
to being the u s  ambassador
to monaco 
he s withdrawn from
consideration at the last minute
no one knows why  she does 
ceos with college aged
mistresses
an svp of an investment bank
who wanted molly to put
a marked deck in a game 
the head of a movie studio
that texted her that
a particular movie star was too
black for his liking  i mean   
j  edgar hoover didn t
have this much shit on bobby 
you know  she could
have written a best seller
and been set for life 
easy  she s got the  she s got
the winning lottery ticket
and she won t cash it 
your office took every dollar
she has in a constitutionally
fucked up seizure
and then put the irs on her
to tax what you seized 
i mean   
i ve been in those
strategy meetings 
you you broke her back
so she couldn t possibly
afford to defend herself 
and now she has an opportunity
to guarantee her freedom
by  providing color  
and she still won t do it 
this woman does not belong
in a rico indictment
she belongs
on a box of wheaties 
so  yes  harrison 
i am imploring you
to do the right thing 
she knows nothing
about the three petes
nothing about ragnyada  nothing
about rgo or insurance fraud 
between the two of us  we ve
appeared in front of this judge
28 times as prosecutors
and not once
has he deviated from
our sentencing recommendations
he s not gonna start now 
i know you ve been putting this
bust together for three years
and there s no one who doesn t
want to see mobsters go to jail
including and especially
the one person in the room
who s had one of them
put a gun in her mouth 
probation  community service 
or better yet
just consider that all she did
was run a poker game
exactly the same way
every casino in america does
and drop the god damn charges 
anything else
you d like to add 
 charlie 
no 
there s nothing else
she d like to add 
uh  i d like to talk
to charlie in private
if that d be okay with you 
 charlie 
yeah 
why don t you just grab
some dinner for an hour
and meet me back at the office 
huh  i m sorry 
did you want a hot dog 
i ll have a pretzel  please 
 song on pa 
here you go 
hi  i would like to rent
a pair of skates  size 7 
but i don t have any money 
these are  800 dollar leather
chanel gloves  i ll trade you 
 800 dollar gloves 
and they keep hands just
as warm as the  10 dollar kind 
  miss  are you alright 
  i m fine 
i m divesting 
  these dreams go on  
  when i close my eyes  
  every second of the night  
  and you become alive  
  these dreams asleep  
 skates scraping 
  every moment i m awake   
  hey  look out 
  careful 
hey  slow down 
hey  miss  slow down 
catch me 
come on  catch me 
hey  slow down 
  bend your knee 
  dad 
  ah  ah 
  oh 
 male  6 
you alright 
  sorry about that 
  i got you 
sorry 
takin  you off the ice
right now 
how s it goin  
what re you doing in new york 
and how d you know
i was at the skating rink 
  i m a doctor of the mind 
  well  dad   
i m here in new york 
because that s where you are 
i called your mom at the hotel
and she said you were here 
listen  it s not a big deal 
but from what i saw out there
i think you re having
a small breakdown 
that s weird 
i can t think of why 
probably because of the arrest
and not knowing
what s going to happen next 
old man  do you really
not recognize sarcasm 
do you 
here  drink this 
i m an alcoholic  i can t drink 
but thanks for remembering 
it s hot chocolate 
okay 
and for diagnostic purposes
do you think that we re on
a cocktail lounge right now 
seeing waiters
with trays of champagne 
wanna check your pulse 
  have you found a pulse 
  yeah 
just admiring my watch 
i can see you re getting
warmed up  but i really
don t have the emotional
bandwidth to defend

for a hundred years 
i m just gonna give you
the answers 
  to what 
  well  let s start with this 
why does a young woman 
who  at 22
has a gold plated resume 
why does she run poker games 
why did i choose
to make a ton of money 
that s a head scratcher 
you were gonna be a success
at anything you wanted 
you know it  if you d gone
to law school  you d have   
you d have owned
the law firm by now 
why did you do
the other thing instead 
i don t know 
drugs 
you didn t start with the drugs
until the end 
they weren t the problem 
they were the medicine 
it was so you could
control powerful men 
your addiction was
having power over powerful men 
  is that what you really think 
  no 
i know it for sure 
you ve now completed
your first year of therapy 
i saw an opportunity 
it wasn t about you 
nah  it wasn t just about me 
  it wasn t at all about you 
  it was 
second year  second question 
do you think
you were a good husband 
what do you care 
i care because you were married
to my mother 
i care because
my father s an asshole 
congratulations 
you ve completed year two 
and for the record 
your father raised three kids
on a college professor s salary 
one of them
is a two time olympian
a sixth round draft pick
of the philadelphia eagles
and a leading philanthropist 
the other is a cardiothoracic
surgeon at mass general
and the third managed to build
a multi million dollar business
using not much more
than her wits 
i m about to plead guilty
in federal court 
well  nobody s perfect 
the point is i did
a few things right 
last question 
no  i ve to go 
last question  mol  i ll answer
it  but you have to ask it 
you have    to ask it 
why didn t you like me
as much as my brothers 
there it is 
i did 
it only from time to time
appeared that i didn t 
it only appeared
that you didn t 
yeah 
that is some
schedule 1 bullshit 
why would   
 it only appeared     what 
what  o okay 
i had an attitude problem 
i talked back  i   
broke some normal
adolescent rules 
i snuck phone time after curfew
i took your car
when i wasn t allowed to 
you drove it into a mcdonalds 
and kids get punished for that
but they don t   
did you not see the mcdonalds 
i mean  did you misunderstand
what drive thru meant 
you d turn into a different
person  your voice  your face   
it s because
i knew you knew 
i didn t hear what you said 
i said   
 i knew you knew  
you knew i knew what 
 larry 
what do you  uh  think about
the following concepts 
just going to run them
by you  marriage 
it is a trap 
that i was cheating on mom 
i knew you knew 
  society 
  it is a joke 
no  i didn t know
unt until i was 20 
  people 
  i don t trust people 
no  you d known
since you were five 
you saw me in my car and you
really didn t know what you saw 
i don t have any heroes 
you knew  honey  and i knew
you knew  and that s   
that s how i reacted
to the shame 
and you reacted by showing   
seething contempt for me 
by driving my car
into mcdonalds 
wanting to have power over
powerful men 
no 
that was a red herring
just to make you mad 
  you re such   
  you tripped over a stick 
okay  twelve years ago 
you tripped over a stick 
it was a one in a million thing 
you tripped over a stick 
that s what you did wrong 
there s your session 
it s funny how much faster
you can go
when you re not charging
by the hour 
i m your father 
trying to comprehend
how much i love you
would be like trying
to visualize the size
of the universe 
i didn t know   
you d got beaten up
until i read it in your book 
it was a hell of a way
to learn about it 
you should know
that i m hirin  someone
to find the guy who did it 
then  i m hirin 
someone to kill him 
don t even joke about that 
i m not 
it wasn t a purse snatcher  dad 
it was the mafia   
i don t care
if it s the leader of hamas 
someone put their hands
on you  they re gonna suffer 
  dad  i m fine 
  no  they re gonna suffer 
dad   
  i m  i m alright 
  no 
they re gonna suffer 
really  i m fine 
  did you know that   
  oh 
i didn t see you 
did you know that we know
what the center
of our galaxy smells like 
it smells like
rum and raspberries 
the center of the galaxy
is ethyl formate
which is the same gas
that gives rum its smell 
and raspberries their taste 
why do you know these things 
to stay busy during games 
i surfed the internet 
then i started
taking online courses 
i m 12 credits away
from a degree in astronomy
i didn t even know
i was enrolled 
hey 
i wanna thank you
for what you said tonight 
it was stella   
who asked me to be your lawyer 
she read the book 
i accused her
of reading trash 
but she defended
the book impressively 
and then defended you 
you re her role model 
i m good with that 
there s a new offer
on the table 
what is it 
we hand over the hard drives 
i don t get it 
we hand over
the forensic imaging
of the emails and texts
in exchange for   
exchange for  what could they
possibly offer me to do that 
i wrote it all down 
it s  um   
your money back 
they ll give you all your money
back  plus interest 
it s over five million dollars 
is that why they took it
in the first place 
so they could offer it
back to me 
yeah  for what it s worth
if we went to trial 
you d have to hand over
the forensic imaging
and the discoveries 
but that s different than
voluntarily handing it over   
sure  but it s not really
voluntary anymore
when the alternative
is prison 
and that s what they re going
to recommend  42 months 
why do you keep breaking
eye contact with me 
i i m looking right at you 
you think i should do it 
you gotta let me keep
you out of prison 
you ve seen
what s on those hard drives 
yeah  yeah 
it s a lot more
than a little color 
yeah  but complete immunity 
alright 
you get all your money back 
you d be the first defendant
to walk out of a courtroom
better off
than when you walked in 
careers will be ruined 
families  wives  lives on both

 male  7 
all rise 
 molly  the business
of the court began 
we stood for the honorable
judge dustin foxman 
and counsel entered
their names for the record 
assistant u s  attorney
harrison wellstone
for the southern district
of new york   
  the docket was called 
  docket number 1009   
 molly  and some pro forma
instructions were given to counsel 
and i was asked a series
of questions
from a script
the judge had in front of him 
molly dubin bloom 
how old are you 
have you taken any drugs 
medicine or pills  or had any
alcoholic beverages
in the past 48 hours 
sudafed 
is there anything about
the reasons
for you taking sudafed
that would interfere
with what s going on   
 molly  87 questions
he was required to ask
before he d permit me
to plead guilty 
 foxman  is your mind
clear today  ms  bloom 
  it is 
  do you understand   
  what s going on here today 
  i do 
 foxman 
under the constitution and laws
of the united states 
you have a right
to plead to the charges
in the indictment 
  do you understand that 
  yes  your honor 
  and do you understand that 
  yes  sir 
at that trial 
you would be presumed to be
innocent and would not have
to prove that you were innocent 
  do you understand that 
  yes  sir 
yes  your honor 
yes  sir 
if you plead guilty
and i accept your plea
you will give up
your right to appeal
along with all other rights
i ve enumerated 
  do you understand 
  yes  sir 
do you understand
that you are charged
in count 20 with operating
an illegal gambling business
in violation of title 18
united states
code sections 1 9 5 5 and 2 
yes  i understand 
understanding everything
you ve been told
do you now wish
to enter a plea 
  yes  sir 
  how do you plead to the charge 
guilty  your honor 
your plea has been so recorded 
and you may take your seat 
before we move
to the sentencing phase
i would like a word
with counsel  please 
 molly 
and then  something happened 
pardon me  mr  jaffey 
just government counsel 
yes  sir 
what s going on 
what are they doing 
  wait for it 
  what 
will the defendant please rise
for sentencing 
based on all available
information
this court manifestly disagrees
with the government s
sentencing recommendation 
this courthouse
is located within
spitting distance
of wall street 
i know this
from my personal experience
trying to spit at it 
the men and women
who work there will commit
more serious crimes
by lunchtime today
than the defendant has committed
in this indictment 
i simply don t see how
either the people or the cause
of justice are served
by locking molly boom in prison 
 molly  it was as casual as if he
was ordering lunch off a menu 
ms  bloom 
this court sentences you
to 200 hours
of community service 
one year
of supervised probation 
drug testing
and a  200 000 fine 
this case is adjourned 
 molly 
and that was that 
there was crying and hugging 
jokes from my brothers 
tough talk about how no one
messes with the blooms 
and level headed talk
about christmas miracles 
steaks and beer
bought by my father
and full reenactments 
and in the middle of it all
as grateful as you are
the reality starts creeping
toward you like the tide
