molly a survey was taken
a few years ago that asked
three hundred professionals
one question
whats the worst thing
that can happen in sports
some people answered
losing at game seven
male announcer he scores
bruins win in seven games
molly and other people
said getting swept in 4
indistinct commentary
some people said it was
missing the world cup
male announcer
guatemala is eliminated
male 1
goal
molly and some brazilian said
it was losing to argentina
not just in the world cup
any time ever in any contest
but one person answered
that the worst thing
that can happen in sports is
fourth place at the olympics
this is a true story
but except for my own
ive changed all the names
and ive done my best
to obscure identities for
reasons thatll become clear
im molly bloom
and right now im ranked third
in north america
in womans moguls
i grew up
in loveland colorado
about two hours
north of denver
i have a ba
in political science
from the university
of colorado
where i graduated
summa cum laude
with a 39 gpa
the median lsat score
at harvard law school is 169
my score is 173
number 87 up
fifty six on deck
ive spent 16 years
chasing winter
and being coached
by the best in the world
sundays were for working out
with my father
somethings really wrong
molly
when i was 12 years old
for no particular reason
my back exploded
tough it out
good advice
and lose the attitude
molly less than 10
minutes later i was in
the back of an ambulance
i had whats called
rapid onset scoliosis
my spine was curved
at 63 degrees
and id need a seven hour
surgical procedure
that involved
straightening my spine
extracting bone from my hip
fusing 11 vertebrae together
and fastening steel rods
to the fused segments
shes gonna be fine
oh
i wouldnt let her ski anymore
definitely not moguls
and obviously
skiing competitively
is out of the question
oh god thank you
molly
i was on skis again in a year
running moguls in 18 months
and by my 20th birthday
i made the us ski team
its the last round
of qualifying
for the salt lake city
olympics
this is the champion run
at deer valley
the altitude is 8100 feet
and the pitch is 52 degrees
which is the same as the sides
of the great pyramids
the winds 20 to 25 miles
an hour blowing left to right
its 3 below zero
at the top of the slope
and with seventeen skiers
in front of me
its gonna be like trying
to stick a landing
on a frozen infinity pool
kiki blew out of her line
shannon was off balance
on her second landing
molly
hes talking about kiki bandy
and shannon keebler
my two toughest competitors
who had significant
point deductions
on their final runs
i can make the olympic team
right now
go get it
and if i have three prefect
runs in salt lake
the best runs of my life
i can beat the austrians
and the swiss
and have a realistic shot
at the podium
then law school
and then a start up
a foundation that seeds
entrepreneurial women
my fathers
at the bottom of the slope
telepathically telling me
to check my line
check your line
i check my line
male announcer
ready
molly good snow contact
calm upper body
legs together good shape
no line deviation
set up for the dspin and
stick the landing
now two things you need
to know
before the second trick
which will be a 720
the first is that
when visibility is bad
the way it is now
race officials toss pine boughs
on the course
so the skiers have some
foreground depth reference
the second is that
the tightness of your bindings
is determined by whats
called a din setting
if youre a beginner your din
setting is probably a 2 or 3
if youre an experienced
weekend skier
its probably seven or eight
mines fifteen
my boots are basically welded
to my skis right
so how does this happen
it happened
because i hit a pine bough
that had become frozen
in the snow
and i hit it so precisely
that it simply snapped
the release of my bindings
right in that moment
i didnt have time
to calculate the odds
of that happening
because i was about
to land pretty hard
on my digitally remastered
spinal cord
which was being held together
by spare parts
from an erector set
crowd gasps
screaming
give her room
get out of the way move
molly none of this has
anything to do with poker
im only mentioning it
because i wanted to say to
whoever answered that the worst
thing that could happen
in sports was 4th place
at the olympics
seriously fuck you
crickets chirping
phone ringing
hello

youre under arrest for running
an illegal gambling operation
do you understand
uh yes
tomasino

i understand but
theres been a mistake
because i havent
run a game in two years
i want you to take a look at
this piece of paper right here
can you see what
it says at the top
yes
read to me
what it says at the top
united states of america
vs molly bloom
i bet heavy on the favorite
larry
alright what do you um
think about
the following concepts
just gonna run them by you
marriage
it is a trap
society
it is a joke
people
i think theres good and bad
but i dont trust them
i dont trust people
molly every year on our
birthdays my father would
interview my younger
brothers and me
larry who are the heroes
or heroines in your life
who uh who do you
really respect
i dont have any heroes
larry
you dont have any heroes
molly
hows this for hubris
i dont
because if i reach the goals
i set out for myself
then the person i become
thatll be my hero
molly
even by teenage girl standards
i would appear
to be irrationally angry
at nothing in particular
it would be another 22 years
before id find out why
after my colossal wipe out
at deer valley
i decided to take a year off
before law school
i needed to go away
sever myself from reality
and come up with a new plan
so i chose los angeles
a friend of mine
from the ski team
had agreed to let me crash
on her couch for a while
my father had disapproved
of postponing law school
and so declined to help out
but i had 1700 dollars id
saved from babysitting money
and that would support me until
i found a waitressing job
id already had a career
and retired from it
i wanted to be young
for a while in warm weather
i think thats what i wanted at
first its hard to remember
i got a job working
bottle service at a club
in hollywood
called nacional nightclub
it was cuban themed
so my uniform
was camouflaged shortshorts
and a wife beater
the promoter would go over
which record producer
was sitting where which
hot designers which lakers
and borislava the bulgarian
billionaire who didnt drink
but he ran a 100000 bar tab
my job was
to get people to spend
more money than they needed to
could we get a bottle of skyy
you guys look like
you deserve grey goose
what do guys who deserve
grey goose look like
to begin with
theyve got a bottle
of grey goose in front of them
youre quick very clever
uh alright yeah grey goose
molly they just spent an
additional 300 dollars
bringing their total
to 900 dollars
for 8 and 50 cents
worth of vodka
but the club doesnt
need you to buy a bottle
they need you
to buy five bottles
so these girls over here
they let you buy them
shots for a living
it would be like waiting
in a long line to get into
the gap so you can pay
1000 percent markup
to buy all the employees
a pair of pants
i only had one shift a week
i didnt wanna tell my parents
i was a cocktail waitress and
back then i never turned down
an opportunity
to make more money
so i found a second job
as an office assistant
and thats how i ended up
working for dean keith
instrumental music
dean was a partner
in black hues investments
he was a regular at the club
and one night he said
people seem to take to you
hey how would you like to
get paid to go to grad school
and get an mba
in how life works
what makes you think
you know and i dont
im a regular here
and youre a waitress here
look at the fuckin scoreboard
molly dean explained what
my job was by saying
me im your job
molly i answered the phone made
coffee runs set appointments
made spread sheets
what is that
and showed dean
what a spreadsheet was
spreadsheet
but i made 450 dollars
a week on top
of the 300
i was making at the club
which would be enough
to get off my friends couch
i remember the day started
by being about bagels
this is molly
get to the office
dean
pick up bagels
do you mean now
molly
dean was a hollywood staple
over leveraged going broke
trying to prove
he wasnt broke and making
a true effort to be
as vulgar as possible
honestly making an effort
i hadnt told anyone
i was a skier
and it was hard not
to laugh when dean said
anyone ever teach you
how to fuckin hurry
no
what are those
bagels
are these from blue bell
yeah
its on the way from my house
seriously
you might as well have stopped
at a fuckin homeless shelter
you might as well
have walked into
a mother fucking
homeless shelter and said
id like a dozen bagels from
this homeless shelter please
i do not eat bagels
from bluefuckingbell molly
because these
are poor people bagels
from where would you like me
to get your bagels
forget about the fuckin bagels
done
except smarten up
got it
hang on
molly
like i said the day started
by being about bagels
but that would abruptly change
my weekly poker game
is moving to the cobra lounge
tomorrow night
and then every tuesday night
youll help run it
take these names and numbers
tell them to bring
ten grand in cash
for the first buyin
the blinds are 51100
and molly
yeah
dont fucking tell anybody
molly id regarded dean as a
nitwit when i regarded him at all
but on that pad were nine names
along with phone numbers of
some of the wealthiest and most
famous people in the world
i put the numbers in my phone
and composed a simple message
thered be a game tomorrow
night at the cobra lounge
there was
a 10000 dollar buyin
all nine players confirmed
that theyd be there
all within 90 seconds
of my sending the text
molly the cobra lounge sits on
the edge of the sunset strip
and in its heyday was famous
for introducing unknown bands
like the doors
and the beach boys
all i knew was school work
and skiing
id always figured
sophistication
would be easy to learn
if i ever needed it
my cheese platter had
a sticker that read
cheese from the great state
of michigan
diego a professional dealer
was setting up the table
when i got there
i googled what type of music
do poker players
like to listen to
and then tried to figure out
how to make a playlist
out of one kenny rogers song
i set up the bar
put out my cheese platter
and positioned myself
at the door where id been
instructed to only let in
the names on the list
i was wearing my best dress
which i had bought
two years earlier
at jc penney for 88
the players started to arrive
i introduced myself as molly
deans assistant
for you
asked if i could
get them a drink
and took from each of them
10000 in cash
hi
hi

yeah 31 people were named
in your indictment
its black friday
for criminal lawyers
how about the other two
one told me money was his
second favorite form of payment
i know him
the fifth was also taken
but he recommended i call you
why
i told him i wanted someone
whod worked in
the prosecutors office and
wasnt even a little bit shady
do you know about me
um ive been briefed a little
by my daughter who knows
a lot about your story
because her mothers a moron
her mother reads the tabloids
yeah and i read them too
i read your indictment
after i got your call last night
and i bought your book
im only on page 112
but molly did you commit
a felony and then write
a book about it
i havent run a game
in over two years
not to spoil the ending
but thats
when the government
raided my game
and took all my money assuming
all of it was made illegally
which it wasnt
ive been living in my
mothers house in telluride
and i wrote the book so i
could start paying off debts
i just finished the press tour
for the book and i moved back
to los angeles
so i could start over
hm you ran games in la
for roughly eight years
yeah right
without taking a rake
and then you ran games
in new york for roughly two
well i took a rake
for the last six months
in the first 112 pages
you name a bunch of names
sorry
uh
you named the names
of some movie stars
that played in your game
yeah
that not against
some sort of poker code
am i supposed to be sitting
all the way over here
can you hear me from there
yeah
are you taking me
on as a client
my retainer is 250000
do you have 250000
no i dont have anything
what about the sales
from your book
the book isnt
jumping off the shelves
but i will find a way
to pay you charlie
ask around about me
unfortunately
the people id ask
are goin away for a while
what happened on tuesday morning
was called a gps takedown
thirtyone people were arrested
in the same instant
something in excess
of 600 agents were dispatched
to locations
in new york and la
in coordinated strikes
with automatic weapons
and youre trying to tell me
youre in my office
because you raked a game
of texas hold em
have you seen the other names
in your indictment
nicholas kozlowski
peter druzhinsky
peter antonovich
the gershen brothers
i mean come on molly
just how deep
into the russian mob were you
because your book doesnt say
why are you making your daughter
read the crucible
so she can see
what happens to a group
of bored teenage girls
when they gossip
i never read the play
many consider it to be
the best play
of the 20th century
is that what
many consider it to be
i dont defend
violent criminals
ive never hurt anyone
your friends have
ive never heard of 90
of the names
on the indictment
and the other 10
i didnt know they were
connected
id no idea
who they were
let me ask you a question
the character in the book
you call dean keith
he didnt say
poor people bagels did he
i think i know who he is
i think i know
a real estate lawyer
that worked with him
and quit
he said
nigger bagels right
im not telling you his real
name hes not involved in this
but you were willing
to name some names
chair scraping the floor
why is the fbi arresting me
two years after
i stopped running games
were you paid extra
in your book deal
to name the movie stars
im not your guy molly
i wish you good luck
but this just isnt for me
charlie sighs
sighs
i didnt know
who the russians were
i can get you
the 250000
i left 10 times
that on the street
itll just take some time
we regularly lend out our best
litigators like me to the aclu
southern poverty law center
veterans groups
but i dont think
i can convince my partners
to take a flyer
on the poker princess
i didnt name myself
the poker princess
uh molly bloom the self
proclaimed poker princess
is that us weekly
yeah i would agree
it would be unusual
for them to print
something that wasnt true
but its not true
and if you think
a princess can do what i did
youre incorrect
im getting you dont
think much of me
but what if every one
of your illinformed
unsophisticated opinions
about me were wrong
id be amazed
yeah you know what bud
you would
you dont need me
you need a publicist
no i need a fucking lawyer
you didnt answer my question
when was the last time
you slept
it was a while ago
alright
im gonna walk you through
the arraignment this morning
cause you shouldnt
do that alone
im gonna put some bodies
on you and walk you
through the side door

her lips are blue
youre tired
yeah
whats another word for tired
name a synonym for tired
and well get in the car

thats right
lets go home
again
molly i decided to postpone
law school another year
after six weeks of tips
i went to barneys
and asked for a dress that made
me look nothing like myself
id overheard stories
about games that folded
after one bad night and i
needed this one to keep going
and i needed to bring
value to it
molly i knew if i
wanted to cement my place
there was one guy i needed
to team up with
ten thousand
molly
and that was this man
the game had regulars
and the game had guests
and four of the regulars
were famous actors
and im gonna call one of them
player x
im all in
molly
player x subscribed
to the belief that money won
was twice as good
as money earned
he lived to beat people
and take their money
heres player x
talking to one of the guests
into folding the winning hand
i swear on look at me
i swear on my mothers life
i have you
molly player x was the best
player at the table and tonight
this guy was the worst
hes staring at his cards
even a reasonably good amateur
would know it was
mathematically the best hand
which in poker
is called the nuts
there was 47000 in the pot
and the guest
was holding the nuts
but he was starting
to get confused
because a movie star
was talking to him
my mothers life man
im not messing with you
why would you be telling me
either i am messing with you
or youre new to the game
youve had bad cards all night
you shouldve folded
after the flop
and i dont wanna win
more of your money this way
ive got queens under here
take your time
fold
fuck you
no
oh
instrumental music
molly a fish is a
particular kind of player
a fish has money
a fish plays loose
and doesnt fold a lot
a fish is good
but not too good
theres an atm in the hall bro
molly
the cobra lounge may belong
to dean keith
but the game belonged
to player x
people wanted to say
they played with him
the same way they wanted to say
they rode on air force one
my job security
was gonna depend
on bringing him his fish
but where would i find people
with a lot of money
who didnt know how to spend it
and liked to be
around celebrities
if they say
theyre interested in poker
you give em my number
i vet them
they end up playing in a game
ill give you a 1000
the first time they play
five hundred every time
after that
be sure to mention
these guys are all regulars
is this true
these guys play
molly the commerce casino is
off the 5 freeway in east la
and no ones ever gonna confuse
it with monte carlo
id watch the tables
for a while
before i approached
a friendlylooking pit boss
third chair
at table eight cant lose
unless there are players
at his table who can win
you know about the game
at the cobra lounge right

one thousand for every player
you send me

of what they lose
no pros

star of the 1930s
named matthew robinson
matthew robinson shattered
the olympic record
in the 200
at the berlin games in 1936
absolutely shattered
the olympic record
and came in second
the man who came in first
was jesse owens
jesse owens went on
to be a legend
matthew robinson
went on to be a janitor
at a whitesonly
middle school in pasadena
the difference
was 410 of a second
as if that wasnt enough
matthew robinson
had a little brother
who was also an athlete
his name was jackie
i have two younger brothers
who are overachievers as well
while i was ranked third
in north america
my brother jeremy
was number one in the world
and while i was placing into
ap chemistry as a sophomore
my brother jordan was doing it
when he was 12yearsold
or something
i dont know
i was a hot shot student
and a hot shot skier
everywhere but my own house
as i got older i began
to bait my father into fights
without really knowing
why i was doing it
what did everyone
learn in school today
uh i learned
that sigmund freud
was both a misogynist
and an idiot
and anyone who relies
on his theories
of human psychology is a quack
i dont know why youd say that
you asked me what i
learned in school today
is this mrs linwood
yup
did she happen
to mention anything
about his work
on the unconscious mind
his dream analysis has
the credibility of a horoscope
but what got my attention
was that he opposed the womens
emancipation movement
he believed that a womans life
is about her
reproductive functions
so youre really getting
to the nuts and bolts
of why middleclass
suburban white girls
have been oppressed
for centuries
no mrs linwood was just
barbara linwood
doesnt like men molly
she doesnt like dicks
dad theres a difference
molly
dont disrespect me
like that at the table
i wasnt disrespecting you
i was disrespecting freud
and its the kitchen table
not the tomb
of the unknown soldier
and im a professional
psychologist not a quack
i never said you were
yeah you did
and dont do it again
and dont ever use language
like that again
okay ignore my teachers
watch my language
and respect the kitchen table
what else do i
need to do before
im allowed
to disagree with you
make your own money
so you can live
in your own house
and eat your own food
molly id been running
the game for three years
and saved 58000
i was recruiting
and vetting players
keeping the books
call
collecting
and delivering checks
meeting the needs
of all the players
through out the week
and still working
full time for dean keith
who made it clear that
if i quit the office job
id lose the game
call
eights full of nines
clamoring
i thought he had trips too
he was slowplaying
into the river
and he hid the pocket eights
pretty well
its a tough beat man
you owe the game
i know what i owe the game
i wanna talk to you a minute
okay
in the hall
it came from heartache
then it died
from the street
is he cheating
no
how would you know
id know
he and diego
arent in bed together
no
what about him and you
a 52 card deck produces
hundreds of millions
of random patterns
but every time one of you loses
two weeks in a row
youre sure something fishy
is going on
come on
im gonna stop paying you
what do you mean
as my assistant
are you firing me
im not firing you
im just gonna stop paying you
you get paid once a week
from the game
it doesnt seem fair
but i also have a job working
for you 24 hours
and if you didnt have a job
you wouldnt have the game
you understand what im saying
i understand each of the words
that youre saying but i dont
look
24 hours a day every day
but youre gonna stop paying me
to do that job
because im making too much
money doing my second job
and if i say no
ill lose both jobs
because it doesnt seem fair
business is bad right now
welcome to the real world
alright here it is
banks are loaning you money
and they shouldnt
youre a bad risk they know it
so the debt service
on your loans
is close to 20
which is crazy
twenty percent is
barely survivable
if its a bridge loan
but like for instance
its taken you 10 years
to build seven houses
all of which are worth
less than they were
before you built them
because the housing market
is on a downward trajectory
for the first time
in the history of houses
and thats why business
is doing bad
not because youre paying me
450 a week
youre a business savant
ive read every piece of paper
in your office
youre making thousands
in tips every week
why do you care about 450
because i dont want to pick up
your dry cleaning for free
well you dont have
bargaining power here
you can refuse the pay cut
but you could lose the game
cash me out please
molly
i wasnt gonna wait for dean
to take the game away from me
before i put a plan in place
the next morning
i made appointments
at the four seasons
the peninsula
and the beverly hills hotel
the suite was 5200 a night
i spent 17000
on a shuffle master that was
installed in the table
faster more reliable shuffles
less downtime between hands
food was brought in
from mr chow
and available to eat
on the side tables
there was macallan 18
belvedere 1942
remy martin
and a 88 lafite rothschild
served by a bartender whod
already memorized your drink
cohibas and monte cristo
were in the humidor
a professional stylist
turned me
into what my defense attorney
would later call
the cinemax version
of myself
i spent almost everything
i had in preparation
for the phone call
i knew was coming
phone ringing
hello
i want you to listen to me
cause you need to hear this
where are you
i need to tell you something
in plain english
and i need to know
that you understood it
dean
you are unimportant
do you hear me
and you are fired
the job the game
youre fired
can i ask why
how many of my friends
are you sleeping with
im not sleeping
with any of em
thats not what i heard
listen to me
with a hazmat suit i wouldnt
can i give you some advice
lose the bitchy air
lose the superior air
and go to the office
and get your stuff
and be out of there
before i show up
hey are you molly
yeah
im leah um
dean asked me
to pack your personals
i appreciate it
he also asked me
to get the numbers
of tonights players
so i can confirm the list
leah
im really sorry
dont be
my phones in my car
uh ill text you
all the numbers
you need when i get downstairs
i texted my replacement
a bunch of random numbers
with 310 area codes
then i sent a text
to the players for tonight
and told them
the game had been moved
to the four seasons hotel
suite 1401
hey how you doing
drink
thank you very much
do you a part
molly
id love to
yeah
so this guys producing it
you should uh come down
amazing
yeah itll be fun
singing in foreign language
fellas can i have your
attention for a moment
music stops
wheres dean
ill be hosting a game in this
suite every tuesday night
if you play tonight youll be
guaranteed a chair for a year
if you prefer to play
at the cobra lounge
therell be no hard feelings
lets play
molly
the game is mine now
i incorporated and molly bloom
event planning was born
i paid taxes and 1099d
my employees
i never became romantically
or sexually involved
with any of the players
the game would have
fallen apart
this was back when i was
still making good decisions
and i went to a lawyer
to make absolutely sure
all this was legal
are you taking a rake
no
then youre not
breaking the law
but can i give you advice
please
theres a saying
in my business
dont break the law
when youre breaking the law
what do you mean
no drugs no prostitutes
no muscle to collect debts
oh i dont do
anything like that
but you just said
i wasnt breaking the law
you wanna keep it that way
because you dont wanna
break the law when
youre breaking the law
am i breaking the law
not really
were able to find out
for sure arent we
laws are written down
youre not taking
a percentage of the pot
no
youre running a square game
molly
my game had a tricky ecosystem
these guys could buy anything
but here in this room
you couldnt buy your win
you couldnt buy me
you couldnt buy the girls
and you couldnt buy
a seat at the table
theres nothing as sweet
as a win you have to work for
and the wins and loses were
compelling and they were real
of course it helped that the
players were gambling addicts
can i see you for a second
molly
jay youre famous
you are an international
rock star
oh i wasnt sure
youd noticed
you cant send
emails like that
well its not a federal
production okay
i just invited you to cabo
for the weekend
the next woman you send
an email like that to
is not gonna be me
its going to be someone else
youre playing with fire
im telling you that
im in love with you
and you are worried about me
getting blackmailed
oh my that just makes me
more into you
lemon head they wont need
to blackmail you
they can get just as
much money from tmz
and tmz will give them
what they really want
tell me the truth
was mine the first love letter
youve gotten from a player
it was the seventh
all digitally transmitted
you are begging for
your life to be turned
into a very public hell
so thats a no on cabo
why dont you just give your
wife and kids a break
and run em over with a limo
i love the way that
you talk to me
oh god
ive had a thought
yeah
raise the stakes
to what
50k buyin blinds are 250500
thats a 500 percent hike
yeah
i dont think its a good idea
could you guys give me
the room for a second
sure
the players that are losing
a 100000 a week
are gonna be losing
half a million
the players winning
a 100000 a week
will have no one left
to play with
players are gonna get hurt
others are gonna get killed
and some will drop out
its not sustainable
well lose the game
find new players
molly
he meant find new fish
i went recruiting again
first up was donnie silverman
donnie won the world series
of poker last year
and got in touch with me
through one of the players
are you fucking nuts
donnie silverman won
the world series of poker
you can watch it online
he took 11 hands
at the final table
but he had the nuts
on eight of them
and three of those
three were two outers with
four players still in the hand
he ran hot
he doesnt lock his chips down
hes reckless
he gives tons of action
and hes got 12 million
instrumental music
you know
i dont like playing poker
why do you play
i like destroying lives
give him a chair
molly the next recruit
was brad marion
who everyone called bad brad
because he was uniquely
terrible at this game
if there was a worse
player in the world
brad would still find a way
to lose to him
sorry i dont have a chair
but youre welcome to a drink
no i just came to
introduce you to uh brad
male 4
im all in calling it
yeah i call
sorry
i just wanted to introduce
you to brad marion
he wants to play
give me his information
ill check him out
dereks gonna vouch for him
dereks gonna vouch for him
meant derek would cover
any losses if brad didnt pay
up to any amount
hi im molly bloom
brad marion
nice to meet you
you too
molly
but he could pay and had to
because he embraced the fallacy
of being pot committed
im all in
molly
youve already invested so much
you might as well see it
through to the end
bad brad had raised
700 million
for a fund that traded
oil futures and every week
he came to the game
lost a 100000 and tipped me
five thousand so he could
play the next week
he wasnt getting any better
and the guys were
feasting on him
can i get another 50
can we talk for a second
sure
brad this game might not
be for you
i know im no card shark
no youre not
here are your losses
after ten weeks
and youve won never
its actually
a statistical anomaly
yeah i know
i like playing with the guys
i dont have that many friends
dont take my seat away
i can tip you more
no
your tips are very generous
how about ii get you
some books
or even even a pro
to give you lessons
yeah maybe
yeah let me think about it
okay
molly turned out bad brad
knew what he was doing
he was getting customers
hed drop his
100k at the game
and pick up four million
for his hedge fund
tell him whats smart
not me
molly
more on that later but first
harlan eustice
player x said he met harlan
at the commerce casino
and that hed be
good for the game
but i wasnt seeing
what he was seeing
he played tight folding after
the hole cards 64 of the time
it wasnt clear
where his money came from
he produced backyard
wrestling videos
and other lowrent productions
but worst of all
harlan eustice
was a good card player
why would player x want someone
at the game who could beat him
i learned the answer
to that one the hard way
how was your flight
just fine
how are you paying for tickets
between la and new york
i had two million points
left on my amex
they took the card
but let me keep the points
which i thought
was nice of them
you had meetings
hmm
you had meetings in la
about your book and life rights
i did
was there any interest
a company that owns
four thousand
video poker machines
wants to put my face on them
anything else
treat magazine
made a generous offer
treat
its a new magazine
for the highend
photography enthusiast
they want you to pose naked
id be the april treat
i meant interest in your book
ah yeah
any offers
a few i guess
couple
five
really
yeah
and
i passed
youre destitute
and you passed on
five offers to turn
your book into a movie
you will be paid charlie
im just curious as to why
you passed on
what would appear to be
the only way out you have
creative differences
okay
should we start
you know i am gonna
figure you out
well let me know
what you find
you see this
this is discovery
lets see what we discovered
over here we have
peter druzhinsky
peter antonovich
and peter slobo
the three petes
now the three petes run a chain
of corrupt medical clinics
and have been committing
insurance fraud
wire fraud and mail fraud
on an epic scale
now over here we have
the ragnyadagershen
organization
theyre a worldwide
bookmaking operation
handling hundreds of millions
of dollars a year
in illegal sports betting
and over here we have
the alexanderhabib
organization
this is also an illegal
sports betting organization
but this one
financed by an art gallery
owned by shillel habib
who everyone calls
shelly
this is the russian mafia
and the three are tied together
in the indictment through
a poker game
were they tapping my phones
no
molly
thank god
they were tapping the phones
of everyone you talked to
okay
they got you confirming
that you ran raked games
at the plaza hotel and various
locations in new york
theyve also got
a confidential informant
confirming that you ran
raked games at the plaza hotel
and various locations
in new york
you were in violation of 1955
which is a part of the us code
that makes it illegal to run
an illegal gambling business
you know what you did
you finished writing a book
before the good part happened
you really get a kick out
of yourself dont you
you know
i dont like this picture
thank you
youre like the cat
that ate the canary
and then told
the canarys
parents about it
its the picture
the publisher wanted
and i didnt get a vote
i liked the book good story
well told
thank you
i need you to tell
it again though
from the beginning
and this time
without skipping over
the russians
jaffey would you
like a glass of water
id like a glass of bourbon
one more thing
yeah
i need your hard drives
going back how far
what do you mean
well i kept my hard drives
when id buy a new laptop
youre kidding
no
it had a record of who owed what
and spreadsheets on the players
it has more than that
every time you charge your phone
by plugging it into the computer
the computer takes a record
of all your text messages
and emails
my laptop has a record
of all text messages and emails
received years ago on phones
that have been smashed
with an aluminum bat
i wanna run a forensic imaging
on your hard drives
oh no thanks anyway but ill
be destroying those hard drives
no you cant do that
theyre evidence
im going to blow them up
i am literally gonna use
explosives and scatter
the remains in the sea
except you told me they exist
youre gonna have
to pretend i didnt tell you
cant do that
yes you can
you wanted a lawyer that
wasnt even a little bit shady
new information
has come to light
i see that was stupid
molly
there are no hard drives
if you destroy evidence
and obstruct justice
on top of the charges
already brought against you
in this case you will be
i promise incarcerated
you dont understand
whats in those text messages
i understand youve had
boyfriends and therell be
some exchanges that are a little
bit you know embarrassing
i dont care about embarrassing
text messages from boyfriends
as there is not left
the smallest corner
of my private life
that isnt available
for public scrutiny
there are messages that
would destroy other lives
there are messages
that would end careers
and obliterate families
if those the text messages
were to be made public
they wont be
if they were
they wont be
it would be catastrophic
im a lawyer im legally
no
listen to me
i am legally prohibited
from disclosing anything
someone leaked
my last deposition
to the national enquirer
charlie
butterball
my last lawyers name
was butterman
and he was one of five people
in the room besides me
but the information
in that deposition
will be nothing compared
to the consequences
of those text messages
ah i just got it
showing up everywhere
i couldnt figure out why you
named some people
but not others
i thought that maybe
some people paid you
you were wrong
but doesnt matter
no the only people you named
in that book were the ones
that were already named in
the bad brad marion deposition
which you think
i know
somebody leaked it
sold it
to the tabloids
yes
maybe even butterbean
butterman
but i dont know who it was
i watched jenny mccarthy
beat you up
for naming the players
why didnt you just say
hey those names
are already public record
i dont know cause i wasnt
on the view under subpoena
can we please get back
to the emails and texts
is that why you have
creative differences
with the hollywood offers
because they want information
and you wont give them
i dont know you
hm
if what happened last time
were to happen this time
it would make
what happened last time
what is this for
its got every text message
and email
i sent in the last year
as well as a variety
of incriminating evidence
about my clients
now if anything
of yours get leaked
you can sell my phone
to the highest bidder
and ill lose my job
and get disbarred
so in order to demonstrate
the sanctity
of your attorneyclient
confidentiality
youre betraying
the confidentiality
of all your other clients
i know youre not
gonna look at it
how do you know
i dont know
ill fly home to colorado
and be back the next day
with the hard drives
molly
harlan eustice was excited
about the surprise
40th birthday party
he was throwing for
his wife in 24 hours
i rented out the whole
courtyard of the buffalo club
itll be about a hundred people
kumamoto oysters
snow crab lobsters
molly he wasnt taking off
menu items to show off
he was genuinely excited
about the party
he was giving his wife
she doesnt know
anything about it
she thinks were having dinner
with her brother and his wife
molly
i liked harlan
but nobody else liked him
except player x
he played tight
fold
didnt give a lot of action
and always got
his money in good
which means he was
running the odds
five thousand to call
no
molly in other words
he was playing poker
and the others were gambling
and he won
by midnight harlan had
tripled his original
fifty thousand dollar buyin
but everything came off
the rails with one hand
and thats how it happens
thats how you go fulltilt
harlan the best player
at the table
the best player at most
tables was about to get
bluffed off the win by
of all people
bad brad how
because harlan had never
played with brad before
and didnt know yet
that brad was bad
harlans got a boat
9s full
brads got nothing
but his preflop
betting made it look
entirely accidently
like there was
a chance he had pocket kings
twenty thousand
molly
which if true
would give him
the better full house
brads counting off 20000
which means hes going to call
and harlan knows that if
brads gonna call and not raise
it means he didnt
have the boat
and hes betting
a high two pair
probably kings and queens
but then instead
of calling the bet
brad pushes 72000
into the pot
im all in
molly
harlan looks at brad
every tell harlan knows about
carotid artery pumping
stiff hands
brads doing the opposite
brads betting represented
a huge hand
by calling on the flop
check raising the turn
and bombing the river
of course harlan didnt know
that brad didnt know
what any of that meant
so harlan always
a good sport said
nice bet im laying this down
molly as he tossed in what he
didnt realize was the winning hand
brad tosses in his cards too
and one of them flips
over and harlan sees
you didnt have pocket kings
i didnt have any kings
except the one in the middle
you had two pair
i had one pair
the nines in the middle
thank you
molly it wasnt even that
it was that much money
harlan only lost
about 40000 on the hand
but a circuit breaker blew
and harlan was
out for blood now
everyones
molly we have a
112000 on the table
you want another 50
give me another 100 please
upbeat music
sign here for a 100000
molly by 5 am harlan
was down half a million
hed abandoned everything
he knew about poker
and was playing
like a frat kid
swinging for a home run
on every hand
another 100 please
hey bud
molly please lets go
molly
sign here for a 100
molly text messages were going
out letting everyone know
harlan was bleeding
guys were coming by to play
for a couple hours before work
theyd been losing
to him for months
everyone wanted a check
from harlan eustice
if you go home now you can have
a few hours sleep
before sheilas party
soon
come talk to me
hi guys
help yourself to some coffee
youre on tilt
everybody knows it
youre playing
without the weapons
you need to win
youre right
alright thank you
just give me 500000
i just gotta get back to even
molly
that should be the second line
of every gamblers obit
mr feldstein died while
trying to get back to even
harlan never did
and he never got to his wifes
birthday party
she filed for divorce
two days later
there was one last punch coming
that would put harlan
on the floor for good
harlan was heads up against
a guy named frederick
who was austrian royalty
call
harlan had pocket queens
his excellency had ace king
they were both in 65k preflop
flops queen sevenseven
harlan has a full house again
queens full of sevens
with three rounds of betting
in front of him
the count has nothing
all in
and the count goes all in
he wants harlan
to think hes got
two more sevens under there
call
nope says harlan
hes not falling for this again
and he snap calls all in
theres 750000 on the table
diego burns a card
and deals a turn
a king otto von bismarck
now has two pair
kings and sevens
but two pair is nothing
next to a full house
and at this point
the only hand left that can
beat a queen full house
is a king full house
captain von trapp
bluffed two pair
and rivered into kings full
motherfucker
motherfucker
fuck you fucking mechanic
hey
fuck you you bottomdealing
party magician
hey get out on the terrace
youve been pulling this shit
on me for two days
come on come on
party magician
you good
im okay thanks
molly
what the hell
ill apologize to diego
yeah and youre gonna go home
im making a floor call
thats it
did you hear me
i dont have it
a million two
i dont have it
im sorry
go home
im very sorry
you got to tell
sheila the truth okay
tell her the truth
tell her what happened
and im gonna help you
im gonna get you to a meeting
well meet tomorrow
and figure out
what to do about the money
molly harlan and i
didnt meet the next day
he just called me
and said everything was okay
and showed up the next week
with a bank check
for a million two hundred
thousand dollars
molly where did he
get the money from
i loaned it to him
loaned it
i get 50 of his wins
until the debts paid off
and then fifty percent for the
next two years with no exposure
youre getting 50 of the wins
and no exposure on the losses
yeah
first of all hell never
climb out of that
thats sharecropper math
its also usury
its racketeering
second you cant
stake a player
and play in the game
at the same time
ive been doing it
for two years
youve been staking harlan
yeah
jesus christ
its not cheating
it creates
the opportunity for it
tell me how
are you kidding me
tell me how
youve interest in another
you think im going
to take a dive
and if i did who would care
you fold your hole cards
five of clubs
and a jack of hearts
hes still in the game
it would benefit him to know
that the five of clubs
you think im signaling him
im saying it cant
fucking happen again
you disapprove of me
its not personal
it feels personal
when you chat up
every other guy
at the game except me
when you stay late for a drink
with jt but never
have you visited his oscar
i think its bolted
on the hood of his car
its noticeable
when you go out of your way
to demonstrate that you
have no interest in me
you did the same thing to dean
these guys want to play cards
with me not you
be that as it may
you know who the biggest
winner in this game is
its you
you know who
the second biggest winner is
look
its you
what are you taking home
10000 a night now
that is my business
literally
between you the dealers
and the servers
youre taking a lot of money
out of this game
not as much
as im bringing to it
that 10000 is 10000
that doesnt go in my pocket
again my money is
your money is my money
is it
i think we should talk
about capping your tips
you want to get together
with the other players
who on my tax returns
are called clients
and discuss putting
a ceiling on my wages
thats right
itll be americas most closely
watched antitrust case
molly
right there right then
that fast i lost the game
it was the next tuesday
game night
he waited until he knew
id be on the way to the hotel
and then sent me a text
it said were playing
at daves tonight
no need to show up
and i knew the truth
even before i answered
the call that came next
player x laughing
you are so fucked
instrumental music
theres no such word
as verticality
hmm
in the book on page 152
when you lose the game in la
and come to new york
you admire
the citys verticality
its a word
once youre in new york
you talk about games
lasting all night two nights
bein up for days
but you dont mention drugs
there were drugs
im two years clean
but you left the drugs
out of the book
you know what
im not paying you 250000
for your amazon
customer review
so far youre not
paying me for anything
i just emailed you
verticality
from merriamwebsters
dictionary
whats an advance
on a book like this
the advance
it depends
eli
if you guarantee the publishers
certain elements
then i can get you
a million and a half
which youd probably
double on sales
plus ancillary rights
what kind of elements
you have to use real names
eli
theres a guy who sits
outside my starbucks
with a uh
with a cardboard sign
that says vietnam vet
and every morning
i give him a quarter
and right now
the only difference
between you and him
is that you have
a story
im one thousand
percent sure that
the homeless vietnam vet
has a better one
you have one asset
write your story
and i can get you
a million and a half
andand thats the floor
go big or go home
and live with your mother
for the rest of your life
what if i
what if i told the publishers
that ii would name the players
who are already named in
the brad marion deposition
all four
ill use the real names
of the players
who are already
named by bad brad
what if i told them that
you spent eight years
in hollywood and
two years in new york
running the worlds
most exclusive
glamorous and decadent
man cave
eli so what do the
publishers get from you
about people with real names
my advance was 35000
well the first thing
im gonna do is
get you a minor role reduction
get the 12 points
knocked down to ten
whats a minor role reduction
im going to argue
to the prosecutor that youre
uh an employee that was
hired and fired
by the players
not a chance
i think we got a good chance
no not a chance im letting
you make that argument
why not
its not true
let me explain how
the point system works
i know how it works
points correspond
with the prosecutors
sentencing recommendation
you try to get a point reduction
based on a variety of factors
including say
prior criminal history
which i dont have
or whether the defendant
played a minor role
which i certainly did not
you really think this is
a good time to hog credit
i built it from scratch
no
there was already a game
at the cobra lounge
when you came along
the new york game is
what im talking about
i built from scratch
i wasnt fireable
i made sure of that
so no
i wasnt really listening
im refusing you permission
to seek a minor role reduction
im refusing you permission
to invalidate
my entire career
and im not caring
i built a successful
hey do you want kids
you interested
in having a family
very much
i dont get you
some point reductions
and the sentencing
recommendation guidelines
say eight to twelve years
and thats before they
try to jam you up
more for money laundering
the moment you changed the
russians money for chips
i wouldve had to been aware
where the money was
find me twelve men and women
wholl believe
that you werent aware
of exactly who was sitting
at your table
and where the money came from
so thats it
you were a cocktail waitress
molly when i lost the la game
i told myself it was no big deal
it was just supposed
to be an adventure
and a way to meet
influential people
and id saved over 200000
but that was just a weak
firewall id hastily built
to keep out the humiliation
and depression
i knew was coming
it had to end sometime
i just thought
it would be on my time
the game had given me
an identity
respect and a defined place
in a world
that was inaccessible
and in one irrational
heartbeat it was taken away
i was irrelevant
and forgotten overnight
itd been two weeks
since i lost the game
and i made an appointment
to see someone
because now
the humiliation and depression
had given way
to a blinding anger
at my powerlessness
over the unfair whims of men
it was that
there werent any rules
these power moves werent
framed by right and wrong
just ego and vanity
selfish whims with
no regard for consequence
no fairness no justice
and that giggling
cackling call from player x
player x giggling
youre so fucked
i couldnt lose to that
greenscreened little shit
and i didnt want a therapist
to make me feel okay about it
you know what makes you feel
okay about losing
winning
i got on a plane to new york
instrumental music
wall street madison avenue
fifth avenue the dakota
the san remo
the players were here
i just had to bait the hook
this time
i didnt have movie stars
this time
i used playboy playmates
these werent
just any playmates
jesse was
a puerto rican knockout
who grew up working
in card rooms
and was a good player herself
i could stake her
infiltrate other games
and poach
their big ticket players
shelby could write code
and run more thorough
background checks
than the tsa
winston was the daughter
of an american diplomat
shes lived in nine
different countries
and had the email addresses
of half
the saudi royal family
molly whos the biggest
game in manhattan
on any given night its either
teddy chin or tutti toscano
but thats manhattan
what do you mean
biggest game in new york
is in brooklyn
russian jews
buyins a 100k
no one runs the game
they just play and pay
we couldnt promise anyone
theyd rub elbows
with movie stars
but new york has one thing
hollywood doesnt
the yankees
and there was one
yankee in particular
that every man in america
would line up to lose to
dont say his name out loud
write it on a cocktail napkin
crumple up the napkin up
put it in a glass of water
so they can see
the ink dissolve
thats really necessary
no
its not at all necessary
when do we tell them the game
is going to start
tell them its been happening
once a week for about six months
at a location you wont
disclose right now
theres a pretty long
waiting list for a chair
but mollys here somewhere
and ill introduce you to her
50k buyin
blinds are five and one
yeah fifty
mol
50k buyin
no 250
thats going to make noise
enough to be
heard on rodeo drive
instrumental music
molly
the gold coast of long island
has been home
to the vanderbilts
roosevelts whitneys
jp morgan
and fw woolworth
its an impossible ticket
to get but i can talk to molly
molly tonight was a 10000
per person fundraiser
to pay for major renovations
at the east hampton yacht club
mollys around here somewhere
i could introduce you but i
wouldnt get my hopes up
molly
thats for real
there was a charity event
for residents of the hamptons
who own yachts
in my business thats called
a targetrich environment
i have to tell you
the initial buyin is 250000
250000 thats almost as much
as my second car
your friends come to the games
mmhm
molly
it took only 7 weeks
of recruiting to get 10 players
and 7 on a waiting list
and in these circles
that was more than enough
to start the mythology
by morning
gamblers would be telling
and hearing stories
about this game in london
tokyo and dubai
at the end of that year
i reported an income
of 4773000
every square inch of it
legal and on the books
i was the biggest game runner
in the world
all tips
i still hadnt taken a rake
and i still hadnt accidentally
recruited members
of a russian crime syndicate
in the beginning i was using
drugs to stay awake
first adderall
then adderall crushed up
to defeat the time release
then coke valium vicodin
percocet and more adderall
i rented a penthouse apartment
and installed plasma screens
for the sports bettors
i had the lower stakes
games on wednesdays
thursdays and sundays
at my place
with tuesday night at
the plaza being the big game
at 700 the dealers came
and the table was set up
and polished
and ten chairs
were placed around it
exactly 12 inches apart
i used custom chips
and two dealers
who worked an hour on
an hour off
with a new crew coming in
after 12 hours
casinos had discovered
that certain scents
make people more likely
to place big bets
the casinos pump those scents
in through the ventilation
i had custom candles made
id been working
with a new dealer named b
not like beatrice
just the initial
shed been working in
trashy card rooms
on the east side
and we became friends
tone it down
the big players
dont like fast hands
sarcastic dealing cool
you got to do it
not doing it is insanity
you must be able to see that
youve been stiffed four
or five times
youve got hundreds of thousands
on the street
thats money youre
never gonna see again
molly b had been suggesting
it for a long time
she was suggesting it again
because of an incident
the week before
hey cole
hey
come on in
thanks you got my check
molly
i do
its right here
thank you
hey can i show you
something on tv
umm actually
im in kinda a hurry
itll just take a second
have a seat
this is last tuesdays game
shit molly
if the guys find out
youve got cameras on them
theyre gonna go nuts
yeah thats you
in the seventh chair
look at your stack of chips
ive got a cab downstairs
look at the time stamp
106 am
molly
lets fast forward to 107
you lose a hand to boosty
what is this
108
our sheets say that
you didnt buyin again
between 106 and 108
but look at that
your stacks bigger
i can explain its just uh
okay lets rewind
this screens got
the dealer changeover
while at the same time
on this screen
and there we are
this is why i cant reconcile
57000 from tuesdays game
a 711s got security cameras
on their slushy machine
ive got a million
dollars changing hands
every two minutes imbecile
you dont think
ive got eyes on the table
relax
i uh i owe people money
i know why isnt it coming
from the trust fund
i need my parents permission
to get that much
and theyd kill me you dont
even understand what its like
people dont realize
trust fund kids
are suffering
in this economy too
i realize what i did was wrong
did it take a lot of soul
searching to get you there
okay okay first of all
the guys that are making
the counterfeit chips
are taking you for a ride
they know that
there are signatures
built into the chips
exact weight infrared markings
breathe second
dont try this
at anyone elses game
because if you do
they are going to express
their anger in a much different
way than i am
you owe me 57000
when i get it you get the tape
but until then
you dont play in anyones game
molly so when tuesday night
came b was at it again
your exposures crazy
its not if its when
youre gonna get blown up
your risk is nuts
if i took a rake this game
would no longer be legal
and if you cant cover
this game will no longer exist
youre the bank now
youre guaranteeing the game
if you see a hand
you dont want to carry
just look at me
flash me a number
and ill take it off the table
most runners cap it
at five percent
ill see you out there
see you out there
molly
two weeks later around 2 am
there was a pot that was up to
13 million preflop
with five players still in
my hope was that the flop
would chase four of them off
male 5
raise a 100000
300000 to you sir
call
molly there was now 21
million on the table
300000 to you sir
plus 200
molly
26 million
three million
she was right
i was extending credit
big numbers
and its not like
harlan eustice hadnt already
put the fear of god into me
if i couldnt pay one time
thatd be the end of the game
i was the house
thats how quickly
i made the decision
and just as quickly b
calculated 2 percent of the pot
and took it off the table
that was it
i had just taken a rake
in violation of
us criminal code 1955
its time to introduce
douglas downey
cause downeys gonna
take us all the way home
downey was a drunk
and hed stay after the game
and hang out
while i did the books
he was hard to understand
when he was drunk
and his conversation openers

the title of a detective novel
victim of circumstance

story of you know
story of my proverbial
you know
life

i know got it
loser
can you bring me some players

im offering you
no im saying this
because youre irish
and they may not want

im the only irish guy
theyll let play
im not irish
youre not
no
molly bloom
youre thinking
of the james joyce character
i always thought you were irish
im not
can you bring me some players
isnt there a famous book
okay douglas focus up
yes theres a book
by james joyce called ulysses
and theres a character
named molly bloom
and that is why
you think im irish
but now its time
to move past that
can you bring me
some brighton beach players
if youre not irish
what are you
im a russian jew
molly the next week i
had some new players
mike was the first one
to arrive
im jesse
im mike davidoff
molly mike owned a
chain of medical clinics
and had already posted
with a wire transfer
next were the gershen brothers
illya and alexei
they were in the business
of exporting steel to china
alexei brought a quarter
of a million dollars
in cash in a backpack
mr habib good evening
im shelby
im shelly
only one letters different
also im a billionaire i think
i may have seen you naked
no you would remember
molly
and then shelly habib
the habib family
owns the largest collection
of classical art in the world
valued at 3 billion dollars
and shelly runs
the hallie gallery
on madison avenue
as for tonight i was not able
to put my hands on cash today
because i woke up this morning
after the banks had closed
so im hoping youll accept
this as temporary collateral
that is an authentic monet
grabbed it right off the wall
you came over here
carrying a monet
i was driven and i have security
outside the door
okay shelly
heres what i need you to do
i need you to get this
what four
seven
molly
seven million dollar
painting out of here right now
and youre i assume armed
sure
molly security cant stand
in front of the door
fix this up come on back
and ill extend you credit
tonight up to one and a half
youre a very
beautiful woman
please be careful
with the painting
always
molly mike illya
alexei and shelly
those were the players
doug downey brought me
as advertised
they played loose gave action
lost to the regulars
and settled right away
people have asked
wasnt there any way to tell
that some of the players
at your game were connected
to one of the darkest
deadliest
and farreaching organized
crime syndicates in the world
no there wasnt
im gonna go all in
instrumental music
charlie sighs
i wish i had better news
harrison wellstone didnt go
for the minor role reduction
no
he didnt buy that
i was a cocktail waitress
no
aww is it because i wasnt
hey i tried which is what
youre not paying me to do
so what now
the government
is expressing an interest
in you being
a cooperating witness
you dont say
molly
who couldve possibly seen that
coming
lets have the conversation
it will be short
because i dont know anything
at all that can help them
you dont know anything that can
help them convict
the russians but you
know things that can help them
did you know that
97 percent of federal cases
never make it to trial
even though the chances
of being convicted
at trial is a little more than
one in a hundred
if you want to go
to trial thats fine
but its gonna cost you
in the area of 3500000
which the justice department
knows i dont have
because they took
all of my money
in a civil forfeiture
which they can do
without a warrant
because my property
doesnt have a presumption
of innocence
then after im arrested
by 17 agents
holding automatic weapons
totally necessary
not at all meant
to intimidate me
im given two days
to hire a lawyer
and appear in a courtroom on
the other side of the country
if youre saying
that everything that happens
from the moment
you are arrested is designed
to persuade you to plead guilty
you are correct
so tell me all the ways
i can help
cause i really feel
i owe it to them
oh speaking of owing
the irs put a tax lien
on the money they took from me
are you ki alright
none of that matters
taking my money wasnt a tax
i also need
to give them my money
or they will take it again
none of that matters
it needed to be said
not really
so to be clear youre not
interested in entering
a cooperation agreement
with the prosecutors
if i had testimony that would
lead to the conviction
of a bad guy no one would have
to coerce me into cooperating
but i dont i have dirt
i have dish i have gossip
so my value to the prosecution
is exactly the same
as it is to hollywood
im here to ensure the
new york post covers the trial
im here to sell tickets
which is nonetheless
value to the prosecution
so what we do
is leverage it to get
you a favorable sentencing
recommendation
or better yet
complete immunity what
oh hey honey
hey stella
hey
hey
what does he have you doing now
an essay on three poems
with what he believes
are a common theme
not an essay two paragraphs
which three poems
close rush and walls
oh i know those
whats the common theme
things with one word titles
are you sure youre qualified
to be teaching poetry
hang on and yes
anytime you wanna run away from
home you can come live with me
charlie then youll discover
she doesnt have a home
and youll come back to me
this is good great
why dont you grab a snack
and start your homework
in one of the conference rooms
okay see ya
theres no law that says you
cant just hit him in the head
there is a law that says that
its the first thing
i taught her to read
go
door closes
my father used
to give us extra work
can i ask you a question
you think im too hard on her
i met a girl when i first moved
to la she was 22
someone arranged through
a third party
to spend the weekend
with her in london
you know what she got
for a weekend five grand
a bag a chanel bag she wanted
whatever youre doing
with stella double it
wheres your father in all this
you mean physically
hes in colorado
your parents still together
no
you and your father close
no
was he tough on you
you know how many girls
at the olympics
have demanding fathers
all of them
well thats right
i was tough on him
what do you mean
um
i was a brat
charlie
fathers dont care
id start fights with him
why
charlene
youre lying
molly why would i
start fights with him
charlie
yeah
charlene
i put you through grad school
i raised the kids
i did every god everything
no
no you listen to me
all you do is cheat on me
and lie to me
and lie to the kids
you lie to your wife
and you lie to your kids
i dont know
for the record the law in 1955
that im accused of breaking it
defines gambling as betting
on games of chance
yes
poker isnt a game of chance
roulettes a game of chance
pokers a game of skill
still i me
ill tell them everything
they want to know about me
about me
thats it
molly
remember bad brad marion
it turns out his 700000000
hedge fund
wasnt what you would
call real
it was a ponzi scheme
hed been falsely reporting
profits for years
he wasnt even registered
with the sec
with the money given to him
by friends and family
and players at the game
he bought several
malibu beach houses
an airplane hanger
full of cars
another one with an airplane
and a life he wanted
when he was arrested
he had 740 in the bank
brad cooperated with the fbi
and gave them hours
of testimony
on a range of subjects
including how three years
earlier
he lost 5200000
in an underground
celebrity poker game
that was run by a girl
named molly bloom
his story was that
i had induced him
to play in a high stakes game
i just wanted to introduce you
to brad marion
molly
and that due to my enabling
hed become a gambling addict
who made me
become a gambling addict
brad this game might
not be for you
molly
federal bankruptcy lawyers
were brought in to recover
as much
of the boosted money
as they could
i was sent a subpoena and flew
out to la to be deposed
can you confirm
the names on the list
all played poker
with brad marion
this list was provided
to you by brad marion
i just need you
to confirm for the record
that your game included
but was not limited to
i understand what im trying
to get on the record is that
im not the one
who provided the list
these names were provided
by brad marion
female 3
so under oath
yes i can confirm
the list is accurate
molly the la players
and i were given a choice
testify against each other
in open court
or help make restitution to the
victims of brads ponzi scheme
i wrote the government
a check for 500000 dollars
and somewhere in an fbi field
office in new york
someone was pinning
my picture to a wall
i was running six games a week
sometimes at two different
locations in a night
and by this point
i was addicted to drugs
adderall ambien xanax coke
alcohol valium
ativan trazadone
anything that could keep me up
for a few days
and knock me out
for a few hours
but i wasnt just taking them
to stay awake anymore
it was dark and friendless
where i was
i felt like i was in a hole
so deep i could go fracking
it didnt feel like depression
it felt more violent
indistinct chatter
i was tired of living
in the frat house
id built for degenerates
i was tired of the greed
mine not theirs everybodys
i was sick
of being high all the time
i was sick
of living in the grey area
i couldnt recognize myself
and what i recognized
i couldnt stand
after a game one night
douglas downey surprised me
with a confession
after opening
with another
detective story title
gut shot on the river
i want to say something
okay
i want to say um something
okay
im just gonna say
cool
because theres a poem
a famous uh
a poem about
thoughts left unexpressed
two roads emerged
from the woods
do they explode
i dont know
do you like poetry
i did until a second ago
im gonna call you
im im in love with you
this isnt happening
plain and simple
youre the woman
ive always dreamed of
and ive been dreaming
shh stop it
listen to me douglas
im the woman all of you
have always dreamed of
im the antiwife
i encourage your gambling
i have drinks served
to you by models
who simultaneously
create the impression
that youre the kind of guy
who can score
a dime piece anytime you want
its nice for you in here
do you know who circe was
uh
circe
used to play
in teddy chins game
nope circe did not play
in teddys game
she was the greek goddess
of magic
and she gave men feasts
with wine and honey

we were friends
i used to be
a competitive athlete
i didnt know if you knew that

pat

i dont know
hey molly
pat asked me a favor
molly he said there were a
couple of hedge fund guys
in new jersey
who wanted to play
and he could score points
with them if he was able
to get them a meeting with me
i said sure and set
the meeting
for 5 pm on a thursday
at the four seasons bar
knowing that if they were legit
theyd recognize someone
in the crowd at happy hour
at the four seasons right after
the closing bell
it turns out i didnt
need to be that clever
these werent finance guys
they were from the cast
of jersey boys
they looked around the bar
selfconsciously
they were out of their element
and tough guys
try to look tougher
when theyre insecure
i had a good hunch
what they wanted
and i was gonna have
to shut down
this meeting quickly
but without being rude
to joey bagadonuts
and secaucus sal
im molly bloom
nice to meet you
john g
and you are
paul
john g
how do we get a drink
molly i dont remember
what the other guy ordered

that he could handle
himself just fine
among the manhattan elite

theyd take one look at me
and call the police
my eyes were swollen and black
my lips were cut and bloody
i couldnt feel my face
instrumental music
pat had set up the meeting
and he was how they knew
where i lived
i stayed in my apartment
for two weeks
waiting for my face to heal
and waiting for the phone call
i knew was coming
but the call didnt come
where was the call from john g
so maybe youve had
a change of heart
after ten days i opened my
front door for the first time
people were coming back into
town after new years in cabo
and st barts
and south beach
my phone was blowing up with
whens the next game
but nothing from john g
and then right there
on the front page
of the new york times
from eight days ago
nearly a 125 arrested
in sweeping mob roundup
those guys
were either laying low
or they were in custody
sometimes god happens fast
my face had healed enough
so that a little makeup
would cover the bruises
that were left
i put together
a week of games
one week of games to get
the 28 million i was owed
and then i was out i was done
one week of epic games
i had some of my
london players in town
and the russians had
visiting friends from moscow
jesse and shelby had already
started the game at the plaza
and were reporting
heavy early action
i was on my way
when the phone rang
it was douglas downey
im on my way doug
douglas
wait molly wait
im hiding in the bathroom
i just ii need you
to believe me okay
i just
whose bathroom
i need you to believe me
because uh
uh at the suite at the plaza
why are you hiding
in the bathroom
i would never tell them
anything about you
i said guys
you want me to go further
you want me to go other
places ill do it
but nothing about molly
she cant be touched
just the russians
okay youre drunk
and a little difficult
to understand
so ill see you in a few minutes
when i get there
i was uh
i was uh
i was cited
for securities fraud
it was scrubbed from my record
thats why you dont know
did you say securities fraud
i would never help them
build a case against you
i would have never give them
anything against you
id commit perjury
before i did that
it was such bullshit
it was 2006
if youd had an arrest
i wouldve known
it was bullshit
doug
i told them ill go further
ill go other places
but not you
i love you i i love
doug listen ii need you to
pull it together for a second
did they scrub your record
because youve been informing
should i
should i have told you
thats a question thatll
thatll haunt me for all my
why are you hiding
in the bathroom
for my days molly
always know that i was
trying to protect you
molly five blocks away
the fbi had raided my game
i fully expected the lobby
to be filled
with guys wearing windbreakers
but it wasnt
reggie ms bloom havent
seen you for a while
yeah
you need a cab
i guess you never made it
upstairs with the packages
maybe i didnt tip you enough
before christmas
harrison then you got into
a cab took the cab to jfk
and flew to your mothers house
in denver
molly
telluride
my mother lives in telluride
that was two years ago
mmhmm
in a cab on the way
to the airport
i checked
my bank account balance
there shouldve had a little
over four million dollars
but instead it said the balance
was zero and there was a note
telling me to contact
the justice department
i just want to mention that she
also voluntarily checked herself
into 28day rehab and has been
sober and clean for two years
i dont care were the women
that worked for you call girls
no sir
they never exchanged
sex for money
no
have you ever exchanged
sex for money
no
i think he was talking to me
i meant no shes not
answering that question
the purpose of this meeting
i know
purpose of this meeting
were off the record
were not off the record
do you see
a stenographer in here
were off the record in
as much as there is no record
but youre free to use
the information youre given
and were not giving
the information for free
ive been sitting at this table
for five hours
waiting for the opportunity
to implore you to do
the right thing while begging my
client for the last three weeks
to act in her own
best interest
neither of those things
should be hard
the purpose of this meeting
is for you to meet molly bloom
and discover as i have
that shes not the person
the press has invented
shes not under
federal indictment
for getting bad press charlie
and the purpose of the meeting
for me is to discover
if your client is willing to
cooperate with the government
in putting away
some bad people
no
youre not willing to cooperate
uh no i never traded
sex for money
im still not sure if theres
a record but if there is
i want it to be certain
that was in it
it appears to me throughout
your career as a game runner
you were extremely diligent
about vetting players
i was
but you let four guys
play in the game
without knowing
they were connected
yeah plus an fbi informant
its embarrassing
i was high
at the end and
doing my job badly
ill also add that in my limited
experience with the russian mob
they dont immediately
present themselves as mobsters
my experience with the italian
mob on the other hand
help us
i dont know anything
that can help you
yes yes you do
and if i did
you can provide color
you can paint a picture
you can tell us druzhinsky
wore a 100000
patek philippe
and even drove a phantom
you can tell us illya gershen
showed up
with a quarter million dollars
cash in a backpack and you can
tell us how much action shelly
was taking on a sports bet
no one was allowed to place
sports bets inside the room
they would have to go outside
so i had no idea how much
anyone was taking or laying
so now youre saying
you knew they were making
and taking sports bets
thats the point of them
going outside
they could have been calling
their mother for all i knew
molly
yes sir
i dont believe you
in mike davidoffs phone
intercepts alone
just davidoff your
name comes up 19 times
we need molly get
molly bring molly
it strongly suggests
that you were important
to his business so its hard
for me to believe
that someone with your savvy
and obvious intellect
talking about the drug
get molly bring molly
we need molly
its theyre talking
about the drug ecstasy
shit my office is next to yours
for two years
and ive seen you make
some boneheaded moves
but ive never seen
any prosecutor
step in it
the way you just did
you should thank
all of the gods that
there is no physical evidence
of that exchange
hey look
no you look
werent you going to implore me
to do the right thing
this woman does not belong
in a rico indictment
are you out of your minds
she does not belong
in a mob indictment
she raked a game thats it
for seven months two years ago
and why because she was giving
credit in the millions
and she didnt want to use
muscle to collect
she has had opportunity after
opportunity to greatly benefit
herself by just telling
the real stories that she knows
okay i have the forensic
imaging going back to 2007
and im talking
about text messages emails
movie stars rock stars
athletes billionaires
all explicit
some married with kids
and thats just
the tip of the iceberg
what about the guy
that comes this close
to being the us ambassador
to monaco
hes withdrawn from
consideration at the last minute
no one knows why she does
ceos with collegeaged
mistresses
an svp of an investment bank
who wanted molly to put
a marked deck in a game
the head of a movie studio
that texted her that
a particular movie star was too
black for his liking i mean
j edgar hoover didnt
have this much shit on bobby
you know she could
have written a best seller
and been set for life
easy shes got the shes got
the winning lottery ticket
and she wont cash it
your office took every dollar
she has in a constitutionally
fucked up seizure
and then put the irs on her
to tax what you seized
i mean
ive been in those
strategy meetings
youyou broke her back
so she couldnt possibly
afford to defend herself
and now she has an opportunity
to guarantee her freedom
by providing color
and she still wont do it
this woman does not belong
in a rico indictment
she belongs
on a box of wheaties
so yes harrison
i am imploring you
to do the right thing
she knows nothing
about the three petes
nothing about ragnyada nothing
about rgo or insurance fraud
between the two of us weve
appeared in front of this judge
28 times as prosecutors
and not once
has he deviated from
our sentencing recommendations
hes not gonna start now
i know youve been putting this
bust together for three years
and theres no one who doesnt
want to see mobsters go to jail
including and especially
the one person in the room
whos had one of them
put a gun in her mouth
probation community service
or better yet
just consider that all she did
was run a poker game
exactly the same way
every casino in america does
and drop the god damn charges
anything else
youd like to add
charlie
no
theres nothing else
shed like to add
uh id like to talk
to charlie in private
if thatd be okay with you
charlie
yeah
why dont you just grab
some dinner for an hour
and meet me back at the office

seething contempt for me
by driving my car
into mcdonalds
wanting to have power over
powerful men
no
that was a redherring
just to make you mad
youre such
you tripped over a stick
okay twelve years ago
you tripped over a stick
it was a one in a million thing
you tripped over a stick
thats what you did wrong
theres your session
its funny how much faster
you can go
when youre not charging
by the hour
im your father
trying to comprehend
how much i love you
would be like trying
to visualize the size
of the universe
i didnt know
youd got beaten up
until i read it in your book
it was a hell of a way
to learn about it
you should know
that im hirin someone
to find the guy who did it
then im hirin
someone to kill him
dont even joke about that
im not
it wasnt a purse snatcher dad
it was the mafia
i dont care
if its the leader of hamas
someone put their hands
on you theyre gonna suffer
dad im fine
no theyre gonna suffer
dad
im im alright
no
theyre gonna suffer
really im fine
did you know that
oh
i didnt see you
did you know that we know
what the center
of our galaxy smells like
it smells like
rum and raspberries
the center of the galaxy
is ethyl formate
which is the same gas
that gives rum its smell
and raspberries their taste
why do you know these things
to stay busy during games
i surfed the internet
then i started
taking online courses
im 12 credits away
from a degree in astronomy
i didnt even know
i was enrolled
hey
i wanna thank you
for what you said tonight
it was stella
who asked me to be your lawyer
she read the book
i accused her
of reading trash
but she defended
the book impressively
and then defended you
youre her role model
im good with that
theres a new offer
on the table
what is it
we hand over the hard drives
i dont get it
we hand over
the forensic imaging
of the emails and texts
in exchange for
exchange for what could they
possibly offer me to do that
i wrote it all down
its um
your money back
theyll give you all your money
back plus interest
its over five million dollars
is that why they took it
in the first place
so they could offer it
back to me
yeah for what its worth
if we went to trial
youd have to hand over
the forensic imaging
and the discoveries
but thats different than
voluntarily handing it over
sure but its not really
voluntary anymore
when the alternative
is prison
and thats what theyre going
to recommend 42 months
why do you keep breaking
eye contact with me
iim looking right at you
you think i should do it
you gotta let me keep
you out of prison
youve seen
whats on those hard drives
yeah yeah
its a lot more
than a little color
yeah but complete immunity
alright
you get all your money back
youd be the first defendant
to walk out of a courtroom
better off
than when you walked in
careers will be ruined

molly the business
of the court began
we stood for the honorable
judge dustin foxman
and counsel entered
their names for the record
assistant us attorney
harrison wellstone
for the southern district
of new york
the docket was called
docket number 1009
molly and some pro forma
instructions were given to counsel
and i was asked a series
of questions
from a script
the judge had in front of him
molly dubin bloom
how old are you
have you taken any drugs
medicine or pills or had any
alcoholic beverages
in the past 48 hours
sudafed
is there anything about
the reasons
for you taking sudafed
that would interfere
with whats going on
molly 87 questions
he was required to ask
before hed permit me
to plead guilty
foxman is your mind
clear today ms bloom
it is
do you understand
whats going on here today
i do
foxman
under the constitution and laws
of the united states
you have a right
to plead to the charges
in the indictment
do you understand that
yes your honor
and do you understand that
yes sir
at that trial
you would be presumed to be
innocent and would not have
to prove that you were innocent
do you understand that
yes sir
yes your honor
yes sir
if you plead guilty
and i accept your plea
you will give up
your right to appeal
along with all other rights
ive enumerated
do you understand
yes sir
do you understand
that you are charged
in count 20 with operating
an illegal gambling business
in violation of title 18
united states
code sections 1955 and 2
yes i understand

yes sir
how do you plead to the charge
guilty your honor
your plea has been so recorded
and you may take your seat
before we move
to the sentencing phase
i would like a word
with counsel please
molly
and then something happened
pardon me mr jaffey
just government counsel
yes sir
whats going on
what are they doing
wait for it
what
will the defendant please rise
for sentencing
based on all available
information
this court manifestly disagrees
with the governments
sentencing recommendation
this courthouse
is located within
spitting distance
of wall street
i know this
from my personal experience
trying to spit at it
the men and women
who work there will commit
more serious crimes
by lunchtime today
than the defendant has committed
in this indictment
i simply dont see how
either the people or the cause
of justice are served
by locking molly boom in prison
molly it was as casual as if he
was ordering lunch off a menu
ms bloom
this court sentences you
to 200 hours
of community service
one year
of supervised probation
drug testing
and a 200000 fine
this case is adjourned
molly
and that was that
there was crying and hugging
jokes from my brothers
tough talk about how no one
messes with the blooms
and levelheaded talk
about christmas miracles
steaks and beer
bought by my father
and full reenactments
and in the middle of it all
as grateful as you are
the reality starts creeping
toward you like the tide
