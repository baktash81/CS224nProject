here s your bud 
he was one of the most
notorious inmates 
here you go 
thank you  sweetheart 
you re an unusual cop  hobbes 
really 
i ve been in this precinct about what 
five  six months 
everybody says 
 hobbes don t take no cream  
 hobbes don t take no cream  
now is that true  or what 
no  i don t like cream 
that means no 
yeah  it means no 
now  is that  no  as in never 
 no  as in sometimes   
   or  no  as in i do
but i don t like to talk about it 
 no  as in never 
this is a big city  hobbesy 
we got a tradition to uphold 
got something wrong with your ears 
the man says something  he says it 
so  hypothetical   
   a cop who s trying to make ends meet
wants a little something on the side   
i don t like cream   
   and i don t judge 
you don t judge 
he s a fucking saint  huh 
so you re telling me
that under no circumstances   
   would a holy man like you ever 
you know   
   break the law or do something   
look  lou   
   i could jump across the table 
snatch your heart out of your chest   
   squeeze the blood out 
and stick it in your front pocket 
oh  yeah 
if i lost control  but if i did   
   l d be no different
than the people we bust 
now  as to your general question   
you take any cop on the force 
cream or no   
   ninety nine percent of the time
they re doing their job  aren t they 
ninety nine five 
point five 
so he or she  cream or no   
   is doing more good out there every day   
   than any lawyer or a stockbroker or   
   president of the united states
can ever do in their lifetime 
cops are the chosen people

like he was advertising 
maybe his prints aren t in the system 
i hate to be stupid   
enjoy it  lou 
   but is motive still something
we think about   
   or is it that all these
crimes are done out of sickness 
number 2 
everything is motive 
sickness is motive 
look sharp 
the coroner s prelim on the ruski 
isn t that the wacko poison
that reese used on them arab kids 
tiff   
you like riddles 
you know  puzzles and shit  brainteasers

they kept it up till  81 or  82 
and it got to be like a booby prize 
it was downtown in the lobby   
   till they remodeled 
must ve passed it by 1 000 times 
i guess i need to open my eyes
and look around sometime 
lyons  i don t remember

check something out 
that   
   language he was speaking   
   later 
that s dutch 
that s what he said 
what s he speaking now  is that dutch 
this now 
this is mumbo jumbo  gibberish 
you sure on that 
who is it 
it s detective john hobbes 
i m looking for miss gretta milano 
  oh  yes  you left a message 
  yes 
i wanted to talk to you about your father 
how re you doing 
may i come in 
sure 
you re surrounded by angels 
i teach theology at the university 
i see  very beautiful 
thank you 
why do you want to know
about my father 
it s 30 years later and the files are sealed   
   and my boss was told to let it alone  so   
   here i am 
i can tell you what my mother told me
before she died 
why do you want to know 
just curious  or    
no  ma am 
see  i m the detective
who caught edgar reese 
i m not sure if you re familiar with him 
he was just   
  yeah  i read about him 
  right  right 
and this reese fella  he   
   in a roundabout way 
gave me your father s name 
did reese like to sing 
yeah  he did  actually 
and at the execution 
did he try and touch you or grab you 
yeah  he did  he shook my hand 
want some coffee 
sure 
okay  one condition 
you and i never spoke 
you say nothing to your boss or partner 
nothing goes in the files 
my name and everything i say
is just between us  agreed 
will i get coffee if i say yes 
detective  my dad was a good cop 
pride of the force and all that 
and then he shot himself 
a reporter found out
my father had been under investigation 
he d caught a killer 
but copycat crimes started 
evidence mounted against him 
fingerprints  witnesses 
the press never got real proof 
but my father s medal was rescinded 
i see 
so you re saying that when he died
someone made this evidence go away 
the mayor  governor and chief of police 
they all needed a hero 
some of these people are
still important today 
  i see 
  no  not yet  you don t 
my father saw the evidence 
told my mother he couldn t beat it 
so he went to this cabin in the mountains 
it s a place that s been
in my mother s family for generations 
he went there and   
the thing is   
   i know my father was innocent
of those murders 
how do you know 
how do you know he was innocent 
it s 30 years ago 
it s not important anymore 
it s important to me  miss milano 
don t you want the truth to come out 
the killer to be punished 
  of course  i do 
  but 
are you afraid if you tell me
your life may be in danger 
yeah 
that s it 
yes 
okay 
okay 
thank you very much 
  for the coffee as well 
  okay 
oh  listen   
if i have any more questions 
can i call you 
i d rather you didn t 
detective   
do you believe in god 
yeah  i go to church every now and then 
what i see in my line of work   
   faith s a little hard to sustain 
good luck 
sometimes i think the basic job
that human beings have   
   is just to figure out
what the hell is going on 
example  gretta milano 
what was she hiding 
what was she so scared of 
and then her question about god 
what the hell is that all about 
you never know 
down to the smallest thing 
that man who passes you
and catches your eye  does he know you 
did you go to school together  is he a
homicidal maniac who hates you on sight 
or is it nothing 
nothing at all 
wake up

pizza is the staff of life 
without pizza and other fine italian foods 
there would be no happiness 
there was one slice left 
garlic  linguiça and pineapple

what 
let s see  noons poisons muskavich   
   dumps him in the tub 
sets out the corn flakes 
three days later somebody does
the exact same thing to him

were killed by the same person 
some kind of ringmaster 
i think so

i got a bad feeling about this 
me  too 
somebody s playing with my dick

yeah  see you 
  ten minutes  art 
  okay 
there are moments which mark your life 
moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same 
and time is divided into two parts 
before this   
   and after this 
sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming 
that s the test  or so i tell myself 
i tell myself that at times like that   
   strong people keep
moving forward anyway   
   no matter what they re going to find 
  miss milano 
  oh  hello

from milano s place 
you found something up there 
well  some things  pal 
you shouldn t know 
like what 
like what 
if you know  you should never  ever tell 
beware my wrath 
well 
what were you doing back then 
  what are you talking about 
  you were singing 
no 
  i wasn t singing 
  you were 
lawrence and mike were singing
some  60s thing 
there you go 
i wasn t singing it 
i hated the fucking  60s 
i wasn t singing 
i appreciate your situation  okay 
i really do 
your father  mother  they re dead 
their lives ruined  your life ruined 
i m very sorry about that 
but i gotta know what s going on 
if this thing is what it seems to be   
   if this thing is
what the book says that it is  then   
is this for real  do you believe this stuff 
i believe more is hidden than is seen 
i believe what i see  i m trying to get
my mind around what i just saw 
something   
   threatened me 
reese threatened me in aramaic 
what else did reese say 
i m asking the questions here 
you answer the questions i ask 
because if i don t know what s going on   
we re not supposed to know 
we re not supposed to see 
it s like the mafia  they don t even exist 
okay    okay 
that s good  that s a start 
they don t even exist 
so where are they from 
who the hell are they 
there are certain phenomena   
   which can only be explained
if there is a god   
   and if there are angels 
and there are  they exist 
some angels were cast down  a few
were punished by being deprived of form 
they can only survive in the bodies
of others  it s inside of us 
inside of human beings 
their vengeance is played out 
that s it 
come on  get out of here 
come on 
i mean   
miss milano  i m just a cop  okay 
i m a detective 
my work is based upon evidence  facts 
mine  too  mine  too 
aren t your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation 
so you re saying that   
   edgar reese is actually   
at the time you knew him 
he was not himself 
  he was azazel 
  yes  azazel 
sadistic  left handed  likes to sing 
reese  why does he focus in on me 
you got his attention 
he tried to get inside you 
he shook your hand  that didn t work 
so now he ll try and find some other way 
like he did with your father 
how do we fight him  is it possible 
i believe it is  and i m not alone 
there s a network  i don t even know
who they are  i just have numbers 
these people know the   
we believe that god limited demons
and made them mortal 
he put a few of us here to fight them 
us  us who 
who  us 
you saying i m one of these people 
i don t know  maybe  maybe not 
you re just doing your job 
okay 
touché 
so these demons are mortal 
they can be killed 
  by the right person 
  who is 
this is religion  mr  hobbes 
these are matters of fate and divine order 
the right man   
  or woman 
  yes 
it could be you  me  anybody 
the right person of the right character
with the right knowledge   
so  this is what you ve been doing 
you ve been preparing for this 
haven t you 
can i ask you something personal 
everything s personal if you re a person 
is this why you live alone 
there s a difference between
risking for yourself and someone else 
that s true 
i mean   
   if i had someone  i d want to share
my life and thoughts  and work with them 
if i shared this  i d put them at risk
and i don t have that right 
you can talk to me 
you don t have to  i m not saying that 
i m not  you know   
do whatever you want to do  i m just
saying you can talk to me if you want 
thanks 
that s a very nice thing to say 
i ve got to go 
i hope i ve been helpful 
  thanks for listening 
  thank you 
i m sorry

he was standing in the street 
yelling at him 
shooting at him 
finally  when the officer   
i guess that s it 
there s no question
that the dead man shot first 
no question at all 
my wife saw it too  if you want to ask her 
a schoolteacher 
what am i going to say 
what am i going to do 
we know that he fired first 
witnesses corroborate 
but his gun was filled with blanks 
he got the gun out of a stolen car 
  it was a setup 
  a setup 
that s right  a setup 
he sets it up for you to kill him 
committing suicide by   
excuse me 
what the hell are you doing out here 
you take sam home 
lock every door  every window   
you don t let anybody in  can you do that 
can you remember that  all right  do it 
  johnny 
  yeah 
are you mad at me or something 
no  art  never  just   
do what i told you 
hate to see the mighty fall 
you know what i mean 
now it s letters  fuck you  lou 
i told you  it s a cult 
some weird  psycho 
aramaic satanist reincarnation cult 
he s got a p o written on his chest 
it s trying to send some kind of message 
the killer s sending a message 
hobbes   
this time  you are the killer 
yeah  sort of 
no fucking sort of 
no breaks  no benefit of the doubt 
we re going back to the precinct  now 
tonight  another shocking murder
in the city 
a well respected schoolteacher
opened fire on an off duty police officer 
the officer   
   john hobbes  was forced to return fire 
our report now  from the scene 
we re on the scene
of a most unusual homicide tonight 
close the door 
detective hobbes shot and killed
a high school math teacher 
the police have not yet identified him 
according to witnesses 
the man started shooting at hobbes   
   who was off duty at the time 
talked to the schoolteacher s wife 
he got married four months ago 
she s pregnant  he just got a raise 
so much for suicide by cop 
the shooting team needs your gun 
i ll get the hearing as soon as i can 
people want the world to make sense 
if the only way i can get the world
to make sense for me is to arrest you   
   then i ll have to do it 
get the fuck out of here 
  it was a clean shoot 
  yeah  i know 
it doesn t help  but i know 
coffee 
no  thanks 
want to talk  from where i sit  we re
dealing with shit that ain t in the manual 
where do they buy coffee with dirt in it 
tell me that 
what s the point of life 
  the point 
  yeah 
  of life 
  yeah 
the point    you want a cigarette 
no  thanks 
the point of life is we catch bad guys 
that s what i used to think 
it s not good enough 
you ll shoot me for talking like this but   
it s two o clock in the morning 
you can talk any way you want 
what are we doing here 
you know what i m saying 
why do we even exist 
us 
maybe it s god  hobbes 
yeah  it could be 
i have a hard time believing that we re   
   part of some huge   
   moral experiment  you know 
conducted by a greater being than us 
if there s a greater being than we are 
why does he give a shit about us 
there s five billion of us 
we re like ants  do we care   
   what ants do from a moral standpoint 
ants 
i m following you 
but at the same time i m losing you 
are you heading someplace here 
that s my point 
are we headed someplace 
if we don t figure it out   
maybe if you figure it out   
   you die 
heart attack  stroke 
you figure out what s what   
   you don t get to hang around anymore 
you get promoted 
meanwhile  delores   
   says we re put here to do one thing 
one thing 
what s that 
it s different  it s different for everybody 
hers is lasagna 
lasagna 
and just one thing  not two or    
maybe two  i don t know 
it s just her opinion 
but it s like   
   when a moment comes   
   we either do the right thing   
   or wrong 
when do you know
when your moment comes 
so  like this could be it for me 
that s the beauty  you never know 
  hello 
  john 
is that you 
hi  i just wanted to see if you were okay 
i ll call you back  i ll call you later 
that was the killer 
we ll arrange things later 
i m going home 
yeah  fuck it 
i killed someone 
he got me to kill an innocent man 
i know 
what do they want  gretta 
just tell me what they want 
the demons 
they want the fall of civilization 
the fall of babylon  as they put it 
  the whole thing 
  yeah 
they re doing a good job  aren t they 
you know  after i shot the teacher   
   azazel moved to someone else 
are you sure  after death 
i m positive  after death  yeah  i saw it 
listen to this 
i was looking through
one of your father s books   
   and it says  outside    
i guess that means outside the body 
outside  they can survive
for one breath only 
a hebrew text says the breath
can carry them for 500 cubits 
i never knew what it meant 
a cubit  that s a distance
or something  right 
from your elbow to your fingertip 
so 500 cubits would be what 
about a sixth of a mile 
yeah  well  you re right then 
they are limited in certain ways 
what are you thinking 
i don t know 
i don t know  you okay 
yeah 
all right  well  then   
   maybe i ll check on you tomorrow 
good night 
good night

down the stairs  go 
all units in the area   
why don t you close that coat up 
cigarettes 
i thought you quit 
i thought they were bad for you 
i did quit and they are bad for you 
you know what s going on 
the police think
that i did some bad things 
  you are the police 
  not anymore 
why do they think you did that 
because   
because somebody   
   made it look like i did 
i once saw that on a show 
i want to talk to you about something 
about your dad 
he s not asleep  is he 
no  son  he s not asleep

i don t think so 
  do you think he s gonna go to heaven

i think so  too 
we got no place else to go

okay  hi  sam 
nice to meet you  i m gretta 
you re in your pajamas

azazel wrote on his chest 
unless i do something   
i ll get you a coffee 
thank you 
i think i got my mind
around this thing now  but let me   
   let me run this by you  okay 
after the host body dies   
   the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits  right 
at the same time   
   azazel says to me
when he moves as spirit no man can resist 
so someone he can t get into by touch 
he can still get into by spirit 
because if  when he s in spirit form   
   he s fighting for his life 
he s going to be that much more powerful 
please tell me what you re going to do 
whatever i do   
   i have to make sure
that you and sam are safe

olly olly oxen free

   pathetic chapter   
   in the life of a disgraced hero

if i die   
   i enter you

now that i ve played you

   maximum fun is   
   i become you 
you got me  hobbes  you got me good 
but i gotta ask you something 
you wouldn t let me kill myself 
why is that 
because i need more time 
time for what  asshole 
five hundred cubits 
that s a long way  azazel 
if jonesy dies too fast   
   as powerful as you are   
   i might never get away from you 
oh  he s catching on 
what  you think you re going to win 
god willing 
you never know 
let me ask you something 
why do you think   
   milano   
   came all the way out here   
   in the middle of nowhere 
to die  the little chickenshit 
i don t think so 
i think that he wanted to do   
   what i m going to do 
  only he couldn t pull it off 
  pull what off 
oh  come on  azazel 
open your eyes 
look around sometime 
here we are  in this beautiful place   
   not another human being
around for miles 
it s just you and me 
what is this  you don t smoke anymore 
that s right  i don t 
you know why 
because cigarettes kill 
especially cigarettes laced with poison 
bullshit 
same poison that you used
to kill my brother 
fuck you 
it s beautiful  isn t it 
isn t it so sweet 
we die together   
   just you and me 
 time
 is on my side
 yes  it is 
fuck you  motherfucker 
i m sorry  jonesy 
i m sorry 
so  like i said at the start   
   i was beaten   
   outsmarted  poisoned   
   by detective john hobbes 
can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands of years   
   and realize you re actually going to die   
   because some self righteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world 
yes  a demon can die   
   and hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game 
so what 
the war isn t over  i promise you 
not by a long shot 
you forgot something  didn t you
