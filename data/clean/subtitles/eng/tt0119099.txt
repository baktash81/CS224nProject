you guys want anything
no
heres your bud
he was one of the most
notorious inmates
here you go
thank you sweetheart
youre an unusual cop hobbes
really
ive been in this precinct about what
five six months
everybody says
hobbes dont take no cream
hobbes dont take no cream
now is that true or what
no i dont like cream
that means no
yeah it means no
now is that no as in never
no as in sometimes
or no as in i do
but i dont like to talk about it
no as in never
this is a big city hobbesy
we got a tradition to uphold
got something wrong with your ears
the man says something he says it
so hypothetical
a cop whos trying to make ends meet
wants a little something on the side
i dont like cream
and i dont judge
you dont judge
hes a fucking saint huh
so youre telling me
that under no circumstances
would a holy man like you ever
you know
break the law or do something
look lou
i could jump across the table
snatch your heart out of your chest
squeeze the blood out
and stick it in your front pocket
oh yeah
if i lost control but if i did
ld be no different
than the people we bust
now as to your general question
you take any cop on the force
cream or no
ninetynine percent of the time
theyre doing their job arent they
ninetynine five
point five
so he or she cream or no
is doing more good out there every day
than any lawyer or a stockbroker or
president of the united states
can ever do in their lifetime
cops are the chosen people
amen
guess im switching to bud
gracie come here

whats he speaking now is that dutch
this now
this is mumbojumbo gibberish
you sure on that
who is it
its detective john hobbes
im looking for miss gretta milano
oh yes you left a message
yes
i wanted to talk to you about your father
howre you doing
may i come in
sure
youre surrounded by angels
i teach theology at the university
i see very beautiful
thank you
why do you want to know
about my father
its 30 years later and the files are sealed
and my boss was told to let it alone so
here i am
i can tell you what my mother told me
before she died
why do you want to know
just curious or
no maam
see im the detective
who caught edgar reese
im not sure if youre familiar with him
he was just
yeah i read about him
right right
and this reese fella he
in a roundabout way
gave me your fathers name
did reese like to sing
yeah he did actually
and at the execution
did he try and touch you or grab you
yeah he did he shook my hand
want some coffee
sure
okay one condition
you and i never spoke
you say nothing to your boss or partner
nothing goes in the files
my name and everything i say
is just between us agreed
will i get coffee if i say yes
detective my dad was a good cop
pride of the force and all that
and then he shot himself
a reporter found out
my father had been under investigation
hed caught a killer
but copycat crimes started
evidence mounted against him
fingerprints witnesses
the press never got real proof
but my fathers medal was rescinded
i see
so youre saying that when he died
someone made this evidence go away
the mayor governor and chief of police
they all needed a hero
some of these people are
still important today
i see
no not yet you dont
my father saw the evidence
told my mother he couldnt beat it
so he went to this cabin in the mountains
its a place thats been
in my mothers family for generations
he went there and
the thing is
i know my father was innocent
of those murders
how do you know
how do you know he was innocent
its 30 years ago
its not important anymore
its important to me miss milano
dont you want the truth to come out
the killer to be punished
of course i do
but
are you afraid if you tell me
your life may be in danger
yeah
thats it
yes
okay
okay
thank you very much
for the coffee as well
okay
oh listen
if i have any more questions
can i call you
id rather you didnt
detective
do you believe in god
yeah i go to church every now and then
what i see in my line of work
faiths a little hard to sustain
good luck
sometimes i think the basic job
that human beings have
is just to figure out
what the hell is going on
example gretta milano
what was she hiding
what was she so scared of
and then her question about god
what the hell is that all about
you never know
down to the smallest thing
that man who passes you
and catches your eye does he know you
did you go to school together is he a
homicidal maniac who hates you on sight
or is it nothing
nothing at all
wake up
go to bed
i know i know
here we go up up

moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same
and time is divided into two parts
before this
and after this
sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming
thats the test or so i tell myself
i tell myself that at times like that
strong people keep
moving forward anyway
no matter what theyre going to find
miss milano

on the wall then he painted over it
my dictionary
says that its the
evil spirit of the wilderness

up to the country
its great to get out of town
lovely fresh air you know
i used to do that go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water
its beautiful
so im curious whered you go
why you ask
come here
come here
come on come here
time
is on my side
yes it is
time
is on my side
yes it is
lou
what
youre always saying
that you want to be free
but ill come running back
whyd you sing that song
song
why were you singing that song
i sang
they put you up to this
why did you sing that song
whatre you talking about
you dont know what im talking about
no i dont
hey you
syrian aramaic
how clever
jesus
its true what i said
i do know who you are
azazel
whered you get that
from milanos place
you found something up there
well some things pal
you shouldnt know
like what
like what
if you know you should never ever tell
beware my wrath
well
what were you doing back then
what are you talking about
you were singing
no
i wasnt singing
you were
lawrence and mike were singing
some 60s thing
there you go
i wasnt singing it
i hated the fucking 60s
i wasnt singing
i appreciate your situation okay
i really do
your father mother theyre dead
their lives ruined your life ruined
im very sorry about that
but i gotta know whats going on
if this thing is what it seems to be
if this thing is
what the book says that it is then
is this for real do you believe this stuff
i believe more is hidden than is seen
i believe what i see im trying to get
my mind around what i just saw
something
threatened me
reese threatened me in aramaic
what else did reese say
im asking the questions here
you answer the questions i ask
because if i dont know whats going on
were not supposed to know
were not supposed to see
its like the mafia they dont even exist
okay okay
thats good thats a start
they dont even exist
so where are they from
who the hell are they
there are certain phenomena
which can only be explained
if there is a god
and if there are angels
and there are they exist
some angels were cast down a few
were punished by being deprived of form
they can only survive in the bodies
of others its inside of us
inside of human beings
their vengeance is played out
thats it
come on get out of here
come on
i mean
miss milano im just a cop okay
im a detective
my work is based upon evidence facts
mine too mine too
arent your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation
so youre saying that
edgar reese is actually
at the time you knew him
he was not himself
he was azazel
yes azazel
sadistic lefthanded likes to sing
reese why does he focus in on me
you got his attention
he tried to get inside you
he shook your hand that didnt work
so now hell try and find some other way
like he did with your father
how do we fight him is it possible
i believe it is and im not alone
theres a network i dont even know
who they are i just have numbers
these people know the
we believe that god limited demons
and made them mortal
he put a few of us here to fight them
us us who
who us
you saying im one of these people
i dont know maybe maybe not
youre just doing your job
okay
touché
so these demons are mortal
they can be killed
by the right person
who is
this is religion mr hobbes
these are matters of fate and divine order
the right man
or woman
yes
it could be you me anybody
the right person of the right character
with the right knowledge
so this is what youve been doing
youve been preparing for this
havent you
can i ask you something personal
everythings personal if youre a person
is this why you live alone
theres a difference between
risking for yourself and someone else
thats true
i mean
if i had someone id want to share
my life and thoughts and work with them
if i shared this id put them at risk
and i dont have that right
you can talk to me
you dont have to im not saying that
im not you know
do whatever you want to do im just
saying you can talk to me if you want
thanks

you know after i shot the teacher
azazel moved to someone else
are you sure after death
im positive after death yeah i saw it
listen to this
i was looking through
one of your fathers books
and it says outside
i guess that means outside the body
outside they can survive
for one breath only
a hebrew text says the breath
can carry them for 500 cubits
i never knew what it meant
a cubit thats a distance
or something right
from your elbow to your fingertip
so 500 cubits would be what
about a sixth of a mile

after the host body dies
the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits right
at the same time
azazel says to me
when he moves as spirit no man can resist
so someone he cant get into by touch
he can still get into by spirit
because if when hes in spirit form
hes fighting for his life
hes going to be that much more powerful
please tell me what youre going to do
whatever i do
i have to make sure
that you and sam are safe
will you take him somewhere
nobody knows about

one at a time huh
thats how we do it one by one
ollyollyoxenfree
time

you like the stones hobbes
i bet you didnt you big monkee fan pussy
times up
see the deal
if i kill you
its just the final
pathetic chapter
in the life of a disgraced hero
just one more piece of shit human scum
but
turn it around
if i die
i enter you
put 20 more murders on your tab
before you go down
maybe your nephew or that
chippy you were talking to
how do you want to do this
i die you die
whats maximum fun can you guess
what maximum fun is
sure you can
now that ive played you
from the outside
maximum fun is
i become you
you got me hobbes you got me good
but i gotta ask you something
you wouldnt let me kill myself
why is that
because i need more time
time for what asshole
five hundred cubits
thats a long way azazel
if jonesy dies too fast
as powerful as you are
i might never get away from you
oh hes catching on
what you think youre going to win
god willing
you never know
let me ask you something
why do you think
milano
came all the way out here
in the middle of nowhere
to die the little chickenshit
i dont think so
i think that he wanted to do
what im going to do
only he couldnt pull it off
pull what off
oh come on azazel
open your eyes
look around sometime
here we are in this beautiful place
not another human being
around for miles
its just you and me
what is this you dont smoke anymore
thats right i dont
you know why
because cigarettes kill
especially cigarettes laced with poison
bullshit
same poison that you used
to kill my brother
fuck you
its beautiful isnt it
isnt it so sweet
we die together
just you and me
time
is on my side
yes it is
fuck you motherfucker
im sorry jonesy
im sorry
so like i said at the start
i was beaten
outsmarted poisoned
by detective john hobbes
can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands of years
and realize youre actually going to die
because some selfrighteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world
yes a demon can die
and hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game
so what
the war isnt over i promise you
not by a long shot
you forgot something didnt you
