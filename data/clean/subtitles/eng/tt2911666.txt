i stole a fucking car
aw fuck viggo

its not what you did
son that angers me so
its who you did it to
who the fucking nobody
that fuckin nobody
is john wick
he once was an
associate of ours
they call him baba yaga
the boogeyman
well john wasnt
exactly the boogeyman
he was the one you sent to
kill the fucking boogeyman
oh
viggo john is a man of focus
commitment
sheer will
something you know
very little about
i once saw him kill
three men in a bar
with a pencil
with a fuckin
pencil
then suddenly one day
he asked to leave
its over a woman of course
so i made a deal with him
i gave him an impossible task
a job no one could
have pulled off
the bodies he buried that day
laid the foundation
of what we are now
and then my son
a few days after his wife died
you steal his car
and kill his fuckin dog
father i can make this right
oh
how do you plan that
by finishing what i started
what the did he hear a fucking
word i said speaking russian
iosef iosef listen
huh
john will come for you
and you will do nothing
because you can do nothing
so get the fuck out of my sight
viggo hello john
i heard about your
wife and im sorry
my condolences
it seems to be fate
or happenstance
or just bad fuckin luck caused
our paths to cross once again
john
let us not resort to
our baser instincts
and handle this like
civilized men to move on

viggos giving me four
to break hotel rules

number of grievances
from your floor
concerning the noise

you keen on earning a coin
babysittin the sleepin one
catch and release
catch and release
my son how might i help you
motherfucker
lets go to the vault
open it
viggo will kill me
uhhuh
ladies out
honestly
what do you think youre
going to do with all of that
this
harry dont worry
housekeeping will find you
treat all your ladies like this
you are no lady trust me
harry is it
howd you like to earn
more than just a gold coin
youve broken the rules
youve done business
on continental grounds
and management does not take
kindly to that sort of behavior
fuck management
dont worry housekeeping
will find you
ashes to ashes
can we recover from this
viggo you know what was
in that vault right
it was nothing
shit
come on
viggo ill say this john
they sure as fuck broke
the mold with you
ay ay
you always had a certain
audacity about you you know
right oh yeah
i can say youre still very
much the john wick of old
am i
people dont change
you know that
times they do
do you know what
was in that vault
artwork cash not
without its worth
but the leverage i
had on this city
audio recordings physical
evidence blackmail
it was fuckin priceless
priceless
yeah i kind of enjoyed that
yeah i know you did
yeah
are you really laughing
so
then you got married ah
settled down
how did you manage that anyways
luck i guess
yeah
yeah while you had
your wife i had my son
and believe me you
had a far better deal
and then you left
and the way you got out
lying to yourself that the past
held no sway over the future
but in the end
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds
which is why god took your wife
and unleashed you upon me
this life follows you
it clings to you
infecting everyone who
comes close to you
we are cursed you and i
on that we agree
finally common ground
okay
step aside
give me your son
john wick
it was just a fucking car
just a fuckin dog
just a dog
viggo
yeah
when helen died i
lost everything
until that dog arrived
on my doorstep
a final gift from my wife
in that moment i received
some semblance of hope
an opportunity to
grieve unalone
and your son
took that from me
oh come on
stole that from me
killed that from me
people keep asking if im back
and i havent really
had an answer
but now yeah im
thinkin im back
so you can either hand over your son
or you can die
screaming alongside him
cool it cool it cool
it cool it cool it
john
where is he shit
shit
i have your word that if
i tell you where he is
youll let me walk away
pull the contract
done
hes kept in a safe house
brooklyn

but it wont matter
will you stop playing
the fucking video game
will you stop playing
that fucking video game
get down get down

from the management

viggo hello marcus
this is john
i appreciate you granting
my son a swift death
i wouldnt know how to
reply to that either
marcus betrayed me
you pulled the contract
and while it was open
you had every chance
every opportunity
to kill john wick
and if you had done your job
my son would be still alive
and in so doing
he broke the cardinal rule
