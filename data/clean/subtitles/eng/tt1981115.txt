came the dark elves
millennia ago
the most ruthless of their kind malekith
sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night
such evil was possible
through the power of the aether
an ancient force of infinite destruction
malekith
asgards forces are upon us
the noble armies of asgard
led by my father king bor
waged a mighty war
against these creatures
send in the kursed
as the nine worlds
converged above him
malekith could at last
unleash the aether
ahh
but asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp
without it the dark elves fell
with the battle all but lost
malekith sacrificed his own people
in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to asgards army
their deaths will mean our survival
this war is far from over
malekith was vanquished
and the aether was no more
or so we were led to believe
sire the aether
shall we destroy it
if only we could
but its power is too great
bury it deep
somewhere no one will ever find it
loki
hello mother
have i made you proud
please dont make this worse
define worse
enough
i will speak to the prisoner alone
i really dont see
what all the fuss is about
do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes
wherever you go there is war ruin
and death
i went down to midgard to rule the
people of earth as a benevolent god
just like you
we are not gods
we are born we live we die
just as humans do
give or take 5000 years
all this because loki desires a throne
it is my birthright
your birthright was to die
as a child
cast out onto a frozen rock
if i had not taken you in
you would not be here now to hate me
if i am for the axe
then for mercys sake
just swing it
its not that i dont
love our little talks
its just
i dont love them
frigga is the only reason
youre still alive
and you will never see her again
you will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons
and what of thor
youll make that witless oaf king
while i rot in chains
thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done
he will bring order to the nine realms
and then yes
he will be king
ah
ive got this completely under control
is that why everything is on fire
ah
youre welcome
ha
all yours
hello
i accept your surrender
anyone else
perhaps next time
we should start with the big one
keep moving come on
keep moving go ahead of me
dont you turn around
where do we go next
hogun the peace
is nearly won across the nine realms
you should stay here be with
your people where your heart is
asgard can wait
you have my thanks
as you have mine
heimdall when youre ready
is vanaheim secure
as are nornheim and ria
though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore
you must think im a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily
that was not my intent
for the first time
since bifrost was destroyed
the nine realms are at peace
theyre well reminded of our strength
and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude
thank you
nothing out of order
except your confused
and distracted heart
this isnt about jane foster father
human lives are fleeting
theyre nothing
youd be better served
by what lies in front of you
im telling you this not as the allfather
but as your father
you are ready
the time has come
for you to take the throne
embrace and celebrate
what youve won
join your warriors
eat and drink revel in their celebration
at least pretend to enjoy yourself
another
there was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks
i remember you celebrated
the battle of harokin
so much that you nearly
started the second
well the first was so much fun
take a drink with me
surely the allfather could have
no further task for you tonight
no this is one i set myself
it does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night
there are nine realms
the future king of asgard
must focus on more than one
i thank you for your sword
and for your counsel good lady sif
hi
hi
so whats the story with you
why does there have to be a story
theres no story
you spent the first
ten minutes of our date
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it
its either chicken
vegetarian or fish jane
i think theres a story
and im thinking
the story involves a guy
its complicated
is he still around
no he
went away
ive been there
the going away its hard isnt it
i was seeing a woman
and she took a job in new york
eventually the distance killed it
and the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes
no
oh so many
hi could we get some wine please
sure id love some
richard this is darcy
what are you doing here
oh hello
so i show up to work
at the labyour moms house
fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas
eating ice cream and obsessing about
you know who
ah
but youre not
youre wearing lady clothes
you even showered didnt you
you smell good
is there a point to all this
because there really needs
to be a point to all this
right
you know all that scientific equipment
you dont look at anymore
you might want
to start looking at it again
this is the reason
we came all the way out here
its malfunctioning
thats what i said
thats what i did
i thought you would do something
a little more scientific
im sure its nothing
yeah its
it doesnt look like nothing
it kind of looks like the readings
that erik was rambling about
our friend erik
kind of went banana balls
hes not interested
im not interested
im interested
its time for you to go now
okay
short but sweet
she needs help
i think im going to have the sea bass
sea bass yeah sea bass is good
sea bass sea bass sea bass
sea bass sea bass sea bass
sea bass
sea bass
jane
maybe you should stop
saying sea bass
and go after your friend
this was so fun
ill just stay here
and say sea bass alone
and i hate you
what i said he was cute
just shut up and drive
you need to take the next left
whos he
hes my intern
you have an intern
oh yeah
hello dr foster
its such a great honor
to be working with you
right i have to call erik
oh take a right
and a left
i have totally mastered
driving in london
hi erik its me again
where are you
i came here because you said you were
onto something and then you vanish
im here at stonehenge
for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today
the police were called to the scene
shortly after 11 am this morning
after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area
then decided to strip naked
and effectively
terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment
whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them
the man later identified
as noted astrophysicist dr erik selvig
has been called in
for questioning by police
come on this is exciting
look the intern is excited
ian
do you want the phase meter
no
bring the phase meter
the toasterlooking thing
yeah i know
what the phase meter is
how do i change the ringtone
on this thing
an astrophysicist with three degrees
should be able
to change her own ringtone
why are you calling me
i didnt want to shout
intern says its this way
ian my name is ian
shh
i am not getting stabbed
in the name of science
its okay were americans
is that supposed to make them like us
theyll make it go away
shh
oh theyre kids
are you the police
no were scientists well i am
thanks
we just found it
can you show us
that doesnt seem right
whered it go
thats
thats incredible
what happened
sometimes they come back
sometimes they dont
i want to throw something
jane give me your shoe
i havent seen readings like this since
since
new mexico
dont touch anything
give me your shoe
oh
were those the car keys
whoa ah
oh
darcy
oh
the aether awakens us
the convergence returns
youre late
merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle
then youre doing
one of them incorrectly
perhaps
how fare the stars
still shining
from here i can see
nine realms and ten trillion souls
do you recall
what i taught you of the convergence
yes
the alignment of the worlds
it approaches doesnt it
the universe hasnt seen this marvel
since before my watch began
few can sense it even fewer can see it
but while its effects can be dangerous
it is truly beautiful
i see nothing
or perhaps
that is not the beauty you seek
how is she
shes quite clever
your mortal
she doesnt know it yet
but she studies
the convergence as well
even
what
i cant see her
jane
where the hell were you
tell me you didnt call the police
what was i supposed to do
not call the police
i was freaking out
you call the cops
they call the feds
next thing you know
we have shleld crawling all over
area 51ing the place
jane
we had a stable gravitation anomaly
we had unimpeded access
our only competition was ten years old
jane you were gone for five hours
what
thats weird
typical
jane
sorry i just needed
to make sure you were real
its been a very strange day
i am jane what
where were you
where were you
heimdall cannot see you
i was right here where you left me
i was waiting and then i was crying
and then i went out looking for you
you said you were coming back
i know i know
but the bifrost was destroyed
the nine realms erupted into chaos
wars were raging
marauders were pillaging
i had to put an end to the slaughter
as excuses go its not terrible
but i saw you on tv
you were in new york
jane i fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world
but i was wrong
i was a fool
but i believe
that fate brought us together
jane i dont know where you were
or what happened but i do know this
what
i know
you do
do what
what
hey
is this you
uh were kind of
in the middle of something here
um im pretty sure
we are getting arrested
hold that thought
look at you
still all muscly and everything
hows space
space is fine
excuse me
are you jane foster
yes
do you know this man
hes my intern
my interns intern
this is private property
and youre trespassing the lot of you
youll have to come with me
jane
jane
thor
are you all right
what just happened
place your hands
on your heads step back
this woman is unwell
shes dangerous
so am i
requesting armed response officers
to scene
hold on to me
what are you doing
holy shit
we have to do that again
hi
welcome to asgard
look upon my legacy algrim
i can barely remember a time
before the light
our survival will be your legacy
the asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered
i will reclaim the aether
i will restore our world
and i will put an end
to this poisoned universe
whats that
be still
this is not of earth
what is it
we do not know
but she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her
thats a quantum field generator
isnt it
its a soul forge
does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another
yes
quantum field generator
my words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely
she is ill
she is mortal
illness is their defining trait
i brought her here
because we can help her
she does not belong here in asgard
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table
did he just
who do you think you are
i am odin king of asgard
protector of the nine realms
oh well im
i know very well who you are
jane foster
you told your dad about me
something is within her father
something i have not seen before
her world has its healers
they are called doctors
let them deal with it
guards take her back to midgard
no i would not
touch her
jane are you all right
yeah
its impossible
the infection its defending her
no
its defending itself
come with me
there are relics
that predate the universe itself
what lies within her
appears to be one of them
the nine realms are not eternal
they had a dawn
as they will have a dusk
but before that dawn
the dark forces the dark elves
reigned absolute and unchallenged
born of eternal night
for the dark elves come
to steal away the light
i know these stories
mother told them to us as children
their leader malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness
and it was called the aether
while the other relics
often appear as stones
the aether is fluid and everchanging
it changes matter into dark matter
it seeks out host bodies
drawing strength from their lifeforce
malekith sought to use
the aethers power
to return the universe
to one of darkness
but after eternities of bloodshed
my father bor finally triumphed
ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years
what happened
he killed them all
are you certain
the aether was said to have
been destroyed with them
and yet here it is
the dark elves are dead
does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me
no
it does not
the worlds are nearly aligned
you will be the last of the kursed
let my life be sacrificed
it is no less than our people did
or you have done
you will become darkness
cursed to this existence
until it consumes you
until then no power our enemies
possess can stop you
i will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn
acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us
oh please
if they were beneath you
my rotund friend theyd all be dead
keep in line
move it
odin continues to
bring me new friends
how thoughtful
the books i sent
do they not interest you
is that how i am to while away eternity
reading
ive done everything in my power
to make you comfortable loki
have you
does odin share your concern
does thor
it must be so inconvenient
them asking after me day and night
you know full well it was your actions
that brought you here
my actions
i was merely giving truth to the lie
that i had been fed my entire life
that i was born to be a king
a king
a true king admits his faults
what of the lives you took on earth
a mere handful
compared to the number
that odin has taken himself
your father
hes not my father
then am i not your mother
youre not
youre always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself
when you came for me
you knew i was in trouble
heimdall had lost sight of you
you were no longer on earth
how is that possible
i believe you were and you werent
the nine realms
travel within yggdrasil
orbiting midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun
and every 5000 years
the worlds align perfectly
and we call this the convergence
during this time the borders
between worlds become blurred
its possible
you found one of these points
we are lucky that it remained open
once the worlds pass out of alignment
then the connection is lost
i like the way you explain things
whats going to happen to me
ill find a way to save you jane
your father said there was
my father doesnt know everything
dont let him hear you say that
jane foster
please meet frigga
queen of asgard and my mother
hi
move
to the dungeons
come on
you might want to take
the stairs to the left
the prisons
loki
go
i will look after her
its as if they resent being imprisoned
theres no pleasing some creatures
return to your cells
no further harm will come to you
you have my word
very well you do not have my word
send a squadron
to the weapons vault
defend it at all costs
secure the dungeon
odin
frigga
go
its a skirmish
nothing to fear
youve never been a very good liar
take her to your chambers
ill come for you when its safe
you take care
despite all i have survived
my queen still worries over me
its only because i worry over you
that you have survived
listen to me now
i need you to do everything i ask
no questions
yes maam
oh
ow
ah
the throne of asgard
is destroyed to the king
frigga
stand down creature
and you may still survive this
i have survived worse woman
who are you
i am malekith
and i would have what is mine
ah
you have taken something child
give it back
witch
where is the aether
ill never tell you
i believe you
no
the universe rotates
on a 5000year cycle
and once a cycle all the worlds align
imagine imagine that this is our world
and
oh thank you and this is another world
normally theyre separate
but during the alignment
everything is connected
all nine realms
all nine realms
are passing through each other
and gravity light and even matter
is crashing from one world to the other
but if this happens to us now
the result will be cataclysmic
my gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the convergence
this time the alignment
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by
its beautiful
its simple any questions
yeah
can i have my shoe back
heal you will need your strength
to reclaim the aether
and when you wake
we will kill them all
jane foster
you need to come with us
we are still unable to restore
the palace shields
our artillery cannot detect them
even heimdall cannot see them
my king we are all but defenseless
shes your prisoner now
leave us
i do not wish to fight with you
nor i with you
but i intend to pursue malekith
we possess the aether
malekith will come to us
yes and he will destroy us
you overestimate
the power of these creatures
no i value our peoples lives
ill take jane to the dark world
and draw the enemy away from asgard
when malekith
pulls the aether from jane
it will be exposed and vulnerable
and i will destroy it and him
if you fail you risk this weapon
falling into the hands of our enemies
the risk is far greater if we do nothing
his ship could be over our heads
right now
we would never even know it
if and when he comes
his men will fall
on 10000 asgardian blades
and how many of our men
shall fall on theirs
as many as are needed
ah
we will fight
till the last asgardian breath
till the last drop of asgardian blood
then how are you different
from malekith
the difference my son is that i will win
jane isnt calling me back
erik isnt calling me back
stupid shield
isnt calling me back
whats shleld
its a secret
hey erik its darcy again
thor came back
he took jane to asgard
and im not sure
what im supposed to do
something else
went missing this week
when astrophysicist dr erik selvig
notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of new york
streaked nude across
darcy
you really need to look at this
your friend erik
what was his last name again
and began shouting at visitors
to the historic site
he was later taken into police custody
for psychiatric evaluation
police are still refusing to confirm
you were not at odins war council
the bifrost is closed
by your fathers orders
no one is to come
or to go
we face an enemy
that is invisible even to me
what use is a guardian such as that
malekith will return you know this
i need your help
i cannot overrule my kings wishes
not even for you
im not asking you to
the realms need their allfather strong
and unchallenged
whether he is or not
but he is blinded heimdall
by hatred and by grief
as are we all
i see clearly enough
the risks are too great
everything we do from here on is a risk
there is no other way
what do you require of me
what im about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order
success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death
malekith knew the aether was here
he can sense its power
if we do nothing
he will come for it again
but this time lay waste to all of asgard
we must move jane offworld
the bifrost has been shut down
and the tesseract
locked away in the vault
there are other paths off asgard
ways known only to a few
one actually
no
thor after all this time
and now you come to visit me
why
have you come to gloat to mock
loki enough
no more illusions
now you see me brother
did she suffer
i did not come here to share our grief
instead i offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament
go on
i know you seek vengeance
as much as i do
you help me escape asgard
and i will grant it to you
vengeance
and afterward this cell
you must be truly desperate
to come to me for help
what makes you think
you can trust me
i dont
mother did
but you should know that when
we fought each other in the past
i did so with a glimmer of hope
that my brother
was still in there somewhere
that hope no longer exists
to protect you
you betray me and i will kill you
hmm
when do we start
he will betray you
he will try
this is so unlike you brother
so clandestine
are you sure you wouldnt
rather just punch your way out
if you keep speaking i just might
fine as you wish
im not even here
is this better
its better company at least
still we could be less conspicuous
mmm brother you look ravishing
it will hurt no less
when i kill you in this form
very well perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions
given that you seem
to like them so much
oh this is much better
ooh
the costume is a bit much so tight
but the confidence
i can feel the righteousness surging
hey do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth
honor patriotism
god bless amer
what
you could at least
furnish me with a weapon
my dagger something
at last
a little common sense
and i thought you liked tricks
well what then your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of einherjar
who will see you coming
from miles away
i wont be the one who comes for her
im not hungry
what the
good lets go
youre
im loki you may have heard of me
that was for new york
i like her
and what of the allfather
it is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne
you called me here on an urgent matter
what is it
treason my lord
whose
mine
my king
the mortal has been taken
stop thor
by any means necessary
there they are take them
on my command
ill hold them off take her
thank you
betray him and ill kill you
its good to see you too sif
assuming you can get lokis help
and you can free this mortal
what good would it do
wed all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace
that my friend
is why we wont be leaving by foot
i will give you as much time as i can
thank you my friend
if you even think about betraying him
youll kill me
evidently there will be a line
i thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing
i said how hard could it be
theyre on the ship
get to the ship
well whatever youre doing brother
i suggest you do it faster
shut up loki
you must have missed something
no i didnt
im pressing every button on this thing
no dont hit it just press it gently
im pressing it gently its not working
ha ha
get him get him
i think you missed a column
shut up
look
why dont you let me take over
im clearly the better pilot
is that right
well out of the two of us
which one can actually fly
oh dear is she dead
jane
im okay
ah
not a word
now theyre following us
now theyre firing at us
yeah thank you
for the commentary loki
its not at all distracting
well done
you just decapitated your grandfather
you know this is wonderful
this is a tremendous idea
lets steal the biggest
most obvious ship in the universe
and escape in that
flying around the city
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us
its brilliant thor its truly brilliant
i see your time in the dungeons
has made you no less graceful loki
you lied to me
im impressed
im glad youre pleased
now do as you promised
and take us to your secret pathway
fandral
right
for asgard
nothing personal boys
loki
if it were easy everyone would do it
are you mad
possibly
tada
we must strike now
no
asgard is meaningless
the aether has found its way home
what i could do with the power
that flows through those veins
it would consume you
shes holding up all right
for now
shes strong in ways
youd never even know
say goodbye
not this day
this day the next
a hundred years its nothing
its a heartbeat
youll never be ready
the only woman
whose love youve prized
will be snatched from you
and will that satisfy you
satisfaction is not in my nature
surrender is not in mine
the son of odin
no
not just of odin
you think you alone
were loved of mother
you had her tricks but i had her trust
trust
was that her last expression
trust when you let her die
what help were you in your cell
who put me there
who put me there
you know damn well
you know damn well who
she wouldnt want us to fight
well she wouldnt exactly be shocked
i wish i could trust you
trust my rage
youll have to sign
for your fathers belongings mr selvig
what
oh yeah
my father dr erik selvig
one mans leather wallet brown
one key ring three keys
prescription medicine
various
and
erik
these
yeah

thank goodness
erik

ive had a god in my brain
i dont recommend it
dr selvig sir
your gear is beeping at me
its happening
its sooner than i calculated
wait whats happening
birds
birds are happening
theyre starlings
its called a murmuration
my dad he used to take me
bird watching as a kid
nerd
look
where did they go
what the hell was that
why are you smiling
theres nothing more reassuring
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are
take me to janes lab
jane
malekith
all right are you ready
i am
you know this plan of yours
is going to get us killed
yes possibly
you still dont trust me brother
would you
no i wouldnt
thor
no
you really think i cared about frigga
about any of you
all i ever wanted
was you and odin
dead at my feet
malekith
i am loki of jotunheim
and i bring you a gift
i ask only one thing in return
a good seat from which
to watch asgard burn
he is an enemy of asgard
he was a prisoner in their dungeons
look at me
loki now
ah
ah
ah
no
see you in hell monster
no no no no
oh you fool you didnt listen
i know
im a fool im a fool
stay with me okay
im sorry
im sorry im sorry
shh
its okay
its all right
ill tell father what you did here today
i didnt do it for him
no
hes going to unleash it
not just on asgard or on a star
malekith is going to destroy everything
how
jane how
i saw him on earth
why would he go to earth
the convergence
oh god
none of this would have happened
if i hadnt found the aether
then malekith
wouldve only possessed it
that much sooner
i only found it
because i was looking for you
jane
now were trapped here
its not me
hello
hi jane its richard
richard where are you
im still at the office
its been a crazy day here today
oh my god this is amazing
is it
i quite enjoyed our lunch
despite never actually
ordering anything
how am i getting service here
is this a bad time
do you want me to try you later
no no no please whatever
you do do not hang up the phone
okay then
i was just wondering
if you want to try again
uh maybe dinner next time
uh yeah yeah yeah
just stay on the phone okay
yeah i will
oh my god
am i interrupting something
no no no nothing at all
come on
im losing you there
are you in a tunnel
where are we going
hello
why are there so many shoes in here
ill just text her
so whos richard
really
jane
hey
you cant just leave like that
the whole world is going crazy
all the stuff we saw is spreading
did you go to a party
erik
jane how wonderful
oh
youve been to asgard
where are your pants
oh he uh
he says it helps him think
okay well im going to need
everything you got on this
all the work youve been doing
on gravimetric anomalies everything
okay
are you well erik
your brothers not coming is he
loki is dead
oh thank god
i i meant im so sorry
thank you
forgive me my liege
ive returned from
the dark world with news
thor
there was no sign of thor
or the weapon but
what
we found a body
loki
malekith is going to
fire the aether at a spot
where all the nine worlds
are connecting
amplifying the weapons impact
for each additional world
the power will increase exponentially
the effect would be universal
but the alignment is only temporary
he must be in
exactly the right place at the right time
well how do we know where that is
we follow the directions
this has happened before
thousands of years ago
and the ancients were there to see it
all the great constructions
the mayans the chinese
the egyptians
they made use of the gravitational
effects of the convergence
and they left us a map
stonehenge
snowdon
the great orme
these are all coordinates taking us
here
greenwich
the walls between worlds
will be almost nonexistent
physics is going to go ballistic
increases and decreases in gravity
spatial extrusions
the very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart
i better get my pants
focus this is important
we have to hammer them in
all around the site
and then jane and erik
will activate them from the tower
theyre taped together
do you even know
what these things do
uh no
neither do i
shh
come on come on come on
right
holy
shit
ah
you neednt have come
so far asgardian
death wouldve come to you
soon enough
not by your hand
your universe was never meant to be
your world and your family
will be extinguished
were running out of time
almost there
are you sure this is going to work
these devices were made
to detect anomalies not cause them
oh come on
come on darcy
you know with all that power
i thought youd hit harder
done
the convergence
will be in full effect in seven minutes
that just means we have to
keep malekith busy for eight
okay you might want to
hold on to something
that is awesome
how did you do that
well the gravitational fields
interact with the weak spots
between worlds creating
ooh get the guy with the sword
oops
lets go
um
what the hell just happened
move
what are you all doing
you need to get out of here now
youre joking right
thats thor out there
hes waving his hammer around
and everything
ah
confirming ship is hostile
confirmed ship is hostile
you have permission to engage
roger
missiles locked
missiles away
missiles off target
i repeat target missed
im losing control
mayday mayday
lost positive control
what are you doing
my signals not connecting
jane
come on
are you all right
you saved my life
yeah
i guess i did
mmm
darcy
jane
ian
selvig
mew mew
mind the gap
how do i get to greenwich
take this train three stops
mind the gap
sorry sorry
were out of time
jane
jane
thor
were too late
the convergence is at its peak
can those things stop him
not from here
we cant get close enough
loan
malekith
darkness returns asgardian
have you come
to witness the end of your universe
ive come to accept your surrender
you think you can stop this
the aether cannot be destroyed
but you can
thor no
jane
ah
everybody okay
hes gonna come back
except you know
last time he was gone for
like two years
well its only been two days so
did he say anything before he left
yeah he had to figure
some stuff out with his father
he kinda committed treason
on our way out
oh
you once said there
would never be a wiser king than me
you were wrong
the alignment has brought
all the realms together
every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them
what can asgard offer
its new king in return
my life
father i cannot be king of asgard
i will protect asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath
but i cannot do so from that chair
loki for all his grave imbalance
understood rule as i know i never will
the brutality the sacrifice
it changes you
id rather be a good man
than a great king
is this my son i hear
or the woman he loves
when you speak
do i never hear mothers voice
this is not for jane father
she does not know
what i came here to say
now forbid me to see her
or say she can rule at my side
it changes nothing
one son
who wanted the throne too much
another who will not take it
is this my legacy
loki died with honor
i shall try to live the same
is that not legacy enough
it belongs to you
if you are worthy of it
i shall try to be
i cannot give you my blessing
nor can i wish you good fortune
i know
if i were proud of
the man my son had become
even that i could not say
it would speak only from my heart
go
my son
thank you father
no
thank you
i present to you
taneleer tivan the collector
whoa
asgardians its an honor
you know why were here
of course
but if i may ask
why not keep it secure
in your own vault
the tesseract is already on asgard
it is not wise to keep
two infinity stones so close together
thats very wise
i can assure you
