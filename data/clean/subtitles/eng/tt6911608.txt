  without a song or a dance

woman 
so  it is nearly time
for the graduating year
to go out into the world 
supported by their friends
and families 
so many of whom they are
grateful to have in attendance
on this august day 
but first  custom dictates
that i call on
the undergraduate selected
  by his or her peers   
  sorry  sorry 
   to deliver
the valedictory address 
this year  that undergraduate 
  punctual as ever   
   sighs 
is donna sheridan 
 cheering 
you re going to do
great things  donna 
 clears throat 
thank you  vice chancellor 
for everything 
this place
has taught me so much
about friendship 
loyalty  love 
but most importantly 
it s taught me
that the best things in life 
the very best things 
happen unexpectedly 
  hit it 
   cheering 
  when i kissed the teacher 
playing 
  everybody screamed  
 all whoop 
  when i kissed the teacher  
 all cheer 
  they must have thought
they dreamed  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  all my friends at school  
   whooping 
    they had never seen  
  the teacher blush  
  she looked like a fool  
  nearly petrified  
   cause she was
taken by surprise  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  couldn t quite believe
her eyes  
  when i kissed the teacher  
    my whole class went wild  
   whooping 
  as i held my breath 
the world stood still  
  but then she just smiled  
  i was in the seventh heaven  
    when i kissed the teacher  
   whooping 
    what a mad day  
    ah  ah  ah  
  now i see everything
in a different light  
  what a mad day  
  i was up in the air  
  and she taught me
a lesson all right  
 kisses 
  i was in a trance  
   whooping 
    when i kissed the teacher  
  suddenly i took a chance  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  leaning over me  
  she was trying to explain  
  the laws of geometry  
  and i couldn t help it  
  i just had to kiss
the teacher  
  what a mad day  
  now i see everything
in a different light  
  what a mad day  
   gasping 
    i was up in the air  
  and she taught me
a lesson all right  
  what a crazy day  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  all my sense had flown away  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  my whole class went wild  
  as i held my breath 
the world stood still  
  but then she just smiled  
  i was in the seventh heaven  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  i want to hug  hug  hug him  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  i want to hug  hug him  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  i want to hug  hug  hug him  
  when i kissed the teacher  
  i want to hug  hug him  
  when i kissed the teacher   
 cheering and applause

 sighs  and every time 
it surprises me 
i have gotta get better
at that 
you give that woman hell
when you get home 
i am not going home 
  not for a long time 
  oh 
the old  stay away
as punishment  ploy 
i tried that  but my parents
just rented out my room 
and sold your dog 
no  it s not punishment 
it s the opposite 
it s like a gift to myself 
  where will you go 
  anywhere 
everywhere   sighs 
life is short 
the world is wide  and   
  i want to make some memories 
  hmm

nothing focuses the mind
like the last minute 
   chuckles 
  but you re ready 
i can t believe
i m not gonna be there 
feels weird 
yeah  but we agreed   
six weeks in new york 
learning the hotel business
from the very best 
it was too big a chance
to pass up 
  soph 
  what 
  nothing 
  what 
no  it doesn t matter 
except that it obviously does 
they ve offered me
a job permanently 
oh 
okay 
  i can say no 
  but you don t want to 
you want to say
the opposite of no 
yeah  i do 
but you could come with me 
but i m here 
i m always gonna be here 
soph  your mum died a year ago 
and i rebuilt this hotel
in her honor 
she wouldn t want you
to dedicate your life to her 
she dedicated hers to me

apparently we can 
until we realize
that there s nothing left
to fight for 
sky 
yeah  i know 
i should go 
yeah 
i ll be thinking of you
tomorrow 
it s gonna be amazing 
take care  soph 
yeah  you  too  sky 
  one of us  playing 
 sighs 
  they pass me by  
  all of those great romances  
  it s as if
you re robbing me  
  of my rightful chances  
  my picture clear  
  everything seemed so easy  
  and so i dealt you the blow  
  one of us had to go  
  now it s different  
  i want you to know  
  one of us is crying  
  one of us is lying  
  in her lonely bed  
  staring at the ceiling  
  wishing she was
somewhere else instead  
  one of us is lonely  
  one of us is only  
  waiting for a call  
  sorry for himself  
  feeling stupid 
feeling small  
  wishing he had never
left at all  
  i saw myself  
  as a concealed attraction  
  i felt you kept me away  
  from the heat
and the action  
  just like a child  
  stubborn and misconceiving  
  that s how i started
the show  
  one of us had to go  
  now i ve changed 
and i want you to know  
  one of us is crying  
  one of us is lying  
  in his lonely bed  
  staring at the ceiling  
    wishing he was  
    wishing she was  
  somewhere else instead  
  one of us is lonely 
one of us     
  one of us is lonely  
  one of us is only  
  waiting for a call  
  sorry for herself  
  feeling stupid 
feeling small  
  wishing he had never
left at all  
  never left  
  at all   
 sighs

   rosie sobs 
tanya  so  two of your three
possible fathers can t make it

and they have great reasons 
harry is doing
some huge deal in tokyo

oh  oh  i would have been fine 
absolutely fine 
i m i m very strong

wicked witch of the west 
she hasn t been seen outside

 horn honking

our hotel manager 
buenos días 
be still  my beating vagina 
sophie 
señor cienfuegos 
these are my mother s
greatest friends 
  this is tanya 
  doña tanya 
hmm 
your beauty comes not only
from the exquisite structure
of your bones
and the laughter
in your sparkling eyes 
but from the goodness
that flowers within you 
like a fountain 
have him washed
and brought to my tent 
don t think fountains flower 
do they 
mine does 
sophie 
and this is rosie 
madam rosie 
  oh

and the passion of a panther
and the wisdom of a flamingo 
  are flamingos wise 
  let the man speak 
we are going to the jetty
to make the welcome
decorations 
sounds wonderful 
we do our best 
it is all we have 
 rosie gasps 
señor cienfuegos

so that s 50 for you
and 50 for me 
  90 ten 
  60 40 
80 20 
that s my final offer 
 bell dings 
 dings 
 clears throat 
  uh  excusez moi 
   gasps 
oh  bonjour  mademoiselle 
um    uh  je suis
locked out de ma chambre 
  oh  i don t   
  uh  je  um   
put my tray out 
uh  dans le corridor 
mais  uh  malheureusement
quand je  um   
turned back  uh 
la porte était fermée 
et maintenant  j je need
une  uh  uh   
uh  spare key  uh  uh  pour 
uh  reentrer dans la chambre 
s il vous plaît  mademoiselle 
sorry  i didn t understand 
could you say all that again 
oui 
je suis   
wait a second 
i don t work here 
well  i should call the police 
i d rather you didn t 
 sets phone down 
they probably wouldn t
understand my french anyway 
donna 
so  harry  you work in a bank 
i m afraid so 
uh  my father 
more or less  owns it 
i m fulfilling my destiny 
 donna sighs 
i m searching for mine 
i have this feeling
it s in greece 
why greece 
i ll find out when i get there 
leaving tomorrow 
  tomorrow 
  yeah 
right  better move fast 
um   
would you mind carrying your
bag on your other shoulder 
uh  sure  why 
well   cause then  you see 
the hand nearest me
would fall straight down 
and mine could sort of
brush against it 
and then i could take
your hand in mine
in a totally natural
and spontaneous way 
or you could just ask
to hold my hand 
  of course  that s plan b 
   laughing 
   quiet chatter 
   piano playing gentle tune 
donna 
it s not just greece generally 
it s a specific place 
at the far end 
there s an island  kalokairi 
and people used to think 
if you sailed on from there 
you d fall off the edge
of the world 
that sounds like
the place for me 
of of course it does 
absolutely 
um  but now perhaps we can
change the subject slightly
and talk about the advantages
and disadvantages of us
spending the night together 
 chuckling  
whoa  okay 
bold move 
because 
from where i m sitting 
i mean  it seems to be
pretty much all upside
with with very little reason
not to just crack straight on 
mmm   
my family don t really
react well to foreign romances 
years ago  my mom
was in central america 
and she had her heart broken
into a million little pieces 
right 
yeah  fair enough 
i mean 
i m sure you re correct 
donna 
mmm 
i mean  there is
one more reason  though 
you d be doing me
a huge favor because   
yeah  this   
this would be my first time 
 laughs  snorts 
 clears throat 
you re kidding 
no  it s a    a thing
i always say
to make me look cool 
  no  i i m not kidding 
   clears throat 
uh   
 sighs  harry 
we just met today 
yes  but when you know 
you know 
  when you fall  you fall 
    waterloo  playing 
and when you re defeated
by love 
you re utterly defeated 
whoa 
  my  my  
  at waterloo  
  napoleon did surrender  
  oh  yeah  
  and i have met my destiny  
  in quite a similar way  
  the history book
on the shelf  
    is always repeating itself  
   whooping 
  waterloo  
  i was defeated 
you won the war  
oh  my   gasps 
  waterloo  
  promise to love you
forevermore  
 donna whoops 
  waterloo  
  couldn t escape
if i wanted to  
  ooh 
    waterloo  
   gasps 
    knowing my fate  
    is to be with you  
   chuckles 
  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
waterloo  
  finally facing my waterloo  
 grunting 
  group  hey  hey 
   grunting continues 
  my  my  
  i tried to hold you back  
  but you were stronger  
  oh  yeah  
   whoops 
  group  oh  yeah 
  and now it seems
my only chance  
    is giving up the fight  
   crowd gasps 
  and how could i
ever refuse   
  i feel like i win
when i lose  
  waterloo  
  couldn t escape
if i wanted to  
  waterloo  
  knowing my fate
is to be with you  
  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  
  waterloo  
  finally facing my waterloo  
 shouting rhythmically 
  so how could i ever refuse   
  i feel like i win
when i lose  
  waterloo  
  couldn t escape
if i wanted to  
  waterloo  
  knowing my fate
is to be with you  
  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  
  waterloo  
  finally facing my waterloo  
 gasps  laughs 
  ooh  
  waterloo  
  knowing my fate
is to be with you   
whoa 
 indistinct chatter 
 laughing 
 thunder rumbling 
rain pattering 
 donna sighs 
that was the greatest event
of my life 
but it s been a good life 
you know 
full of happy things  but   
that was the best of them 
did you enjoy    
no  don t answer that 
but did you 
it was lovely 
thank you 
no  thank you 
 quiet snoring 
 tanya snorts 
  sophie  hello 
  hello  darling 
how s it going down there 
 sophie sighs 
there s enough moussaka
for millions 
with moussaka to spare 
i hope you ll be proud 
i already am 
and so are bill and harry 
i miss them 
they re really sorry
they couldn t make it 
if it had been
any other date   
i know 
but i have you 
to tell you the truth 
i m not sure i can face it 
i don t know if i can 
either  but    we still will 
because it s a special night   
not for mourning 
but for celebration 
 sam chuckling 
that s how mom
would have wanted it 
she would have wanted
to be there 
to get very drunk indeed
and dance until she dropped 
 chuckles 
our dancing queen 
yeah 
it will get better 
yeah 
just not quite yet 
  i ll see you later 
  see you later  kiddo 
  so when you re near me 
darling  
  can t you hear me   
  the love you gave me  
  nothing else can save me  
  when you re gone  
  how can i  
  even try to go on   
  when you re gone  
  though i try  
  how can i  
  carry on   
   horn honks 
   indistinct chatter 
donna 
hey 
 sighs 
you grew your hair 
it s longer now 
it is a bit  yeah 
i know we could talk
about that 
but  uh  the ferry
leaves any second  and  uh   
i think great things
are waiting for me 
i prefer it shorter 
 stamping 
 sighs 
 footsteps running 
 chuckles 
wait  wait 
  please 
   horn honking 
don t  oh  god 
turn around right now 
it s not too late 
this is great 
i m just going to follow you
everywhere 
by the end of the day 
i ll have a whole new wardrobe 
i don t think that ll suit you 
i say i can make it work 
i really wanted
to catch that ferry 
there ll be another tomorrow 
thanks 
donna 
right  uh   
but what would be
really great   
today  not tomorrow   
is if  uh 
somewhere in this harbor
there was a guy 
young  tall 
dashingly handsome 
he s probably
passable looking  but   
he has a boat 
and a couple of days free
before he takes part
in a sailing race 
so maybe he can take her
where she wants to go 
  he d love to 
   chuckles 
but the sad fact is   
this this isn t my boat 
i just wanted to impress you 
 chuckles 
oh  okay 
i m kidding  i m kidding 
jump on  i m bill 
i actually have an elderly
relative on the island
who help   
helped me buy this boat 
there are two beds 
but unfortunately 
  one of them is rather full 
  huh 
convenient   chuckles 
you have one of those smiles
that makes
the rest of the world
smile  too 
 laughing 
it s lucky this trip
is not long enough
for my fragile heart
to shatter completely
when you leave my boat 
ugh  i get it 
you re one of them 
one of who 
there are two kinds of seducer 
first doesn t actually
like women 
so wants to assert
his power over them 
but the second 
and far more dangerous 
is the guy who genuinely
falls in love every evening 
only to fall out of it again
the next morning 
but as you run away 
you tell her
you re the one in pain
and she s just too much
for you to handle 
like this 
   grunting 
  whoa 
  when you were lonely 
playing 
  when you were lonely 
you needed a man  
   scoffs 
    someone to lean on  
   laughing 
    well  i understand  
    it s only natural  
   sighs 
  but why did it
have to be me   
oh  just like that  yes 
  nights can be empty  
  and nights can be cold  
  so you were looking
for someone to hold  
    that s only natural  
   laughing 
  but why did it
have to be me   
  i was so lonesome  
  i was blue  
  i couldn t help it  
    it had to be you and i  
   grunting 
  always thought you knew
the reason why  
  huh 
   laughing 
 bill chuckles 
  i only wanted
a little love affair  
  and now i can see
you are beginning to care  
 gasps 
  but  baby  believe me  
    it s better  
   bill chuckles 
    to forget me  
   donna whoops 
 chuckles  whoops 
official 
your hair 
it s shorter now 
well  yes 
i had to cut it for work 
i wonder  could you please
hurry up a bit 
uh  you see  i ve followed
a girl all the way from paris 
she wrote me a note 
a very kind note 
saying good bye 
but when you ve found
the only girl you think
you re ever gonna love  it s
gotta be worth one more try 
don t you think 
it s better short 
  men are the toys  
  in the game that you play  
  when you get tired 
you throw them away  
  that s only natural  
  but why did it
have to be me   
  falling in love
with a woman like you  
    happens so quickly  
   chuckles 
    there s nothing to do  
   grunts 
  it s only natural  
  but why did it
have to be me   
we only just met 
and you re not
that kind of girl 
absolutely not 
usually 
man  in distance  
hey 
what was that 
nothing  uh  um  a seagull 
now  where were we 
  it s only natural  
  but why did it
have to be     
man 
hey 
come on 
 grunts  sighs 
we re coming 
hi 
just checking
you re not in danger 
which you re obviously not 
so we ll be off 
  uh  my engine is not working 
  oh 
oh  that is bad luck 
i i ll radio for someone
to come and help you 
they should be along soon 
  bill 
  man  please  please 
there is a woman waiting for me
on the mainland 
her family 
they not want her to marry
a simple fisherman like alexio 
they want rich man 
ugly  fat  big mole on face 
but rich 
but she   
she want me 
and i love her
with all my heartness 
please help  kind sir
and beautiful lady
with head full of curls 
 laughs 
well  obviously

both 
yes 
there 
bill 
i see them  okay  everyone 
  we re nearly   
  apollonia 
whoa   laughs 
what are you doing 
we could get you closer 
if you love someone 
you re willing to die for her 
yeah  but you don t have to 
  it s an important distinction 
   chuckles 
apollonia 
alexio 
aah  apollon    
he s just swallowed
a big mouthful of water 
but the basic point
he s trying to make
is that he loves you 
what 
he loves you 
alexio 
apollonia 
apollonia  no  apollonia 
  apollonia 
  apollonia 
apollonia  come back 
 laughs  yes 
  apollonia 
   indistinct shouting 
apollonia 
  good work 
  you  too 
apollonia 
  i love you 
   gasps 
oh  god  i don t think
she can swim  either 
 men shouting indistinctly 
 indistinct shouting 
 whoops 
  sophie  good morning 
  good morning    morning 
sophie  oh  good morning

it s so good

if you are happy 
i would be even happier
if you were happy 
no happiness for me 
as you say 
that ship sailed
many long years ago 
but ships turn around 
they come back 
not for me 
she left  never to return 
but don t you worry 
i have made my peace with pain 
sophie

donna

tanya

  how did donna know 
  what 
that that could be this 
i guess she just   
saw the future 
  i have a dream  
  a song to sing  
  to help me cope  
  with anything  
  if you see the wonder  
  of a fairy tale  
   gasps 
   chickens clucking 
  you can take the future  
 birds chirping 
  even if you fail  
  i believe in angels  
  something good
in everything i see  
  i believe in angels  
  when i know the time
is right for me  
  i ll cross the stream  
  i have a dream  
tanya 
mmm 
  i have a dream  
  a fantasy  
  to help me through  
   screams 
   creaking  crashing 
 gasps  whimpers 
  and my destination  
    makes it worth the while  
   tanya chuckles 
  pushing through
the darkness  
  still another mile   
do you think she d like it 
  oh  sophie   sobs 
  soph 
 wind howling 
thunder rumbling 
oh  no 
he said this might happen 
 woman shouting in greek 
   man shouting in greek 
   thunder crashes 
 laughing 
   crashing 
   gasping 
 horse neighing 
hello

   donna whooping  laughing 
sam 
right 
donna  chuckling  
i just don t think you know
  what you re doing 
  uh   
i m hoping  if i keep pulling
on these two bits of wood 
we might eventually bump
into land 
oh  okay 
there s another little island
over there 
i thought we might go
for a picnic 
where s the food 
oh  you re going to catch it
  on the way 
   laughs  oh 
uh     clears throat 
so   
we haven t talked
about last night 
  no 
  you should know
that i never do that
that fast 
i mean  hardly ever 
well  sometimes 
a bit recently  in fact 
but on the whole  not 
i thought it was miraculous 
um  i m gonna say
something here 
and you should shut up
as i m saying it
because you ll think
i m crazy for a while 
but gradually  you ll   
   you ll realize i m right 
and then you ll spend
the rest of your life
thanking me
for saving so much time
and just getting
straight to it 
well  i m ready 
i wasn t joking yesterday 
i was serious 
i want to stay here 
and i think you should  too 
i think we should make a choice
to do something radical
and wonderful 
to live in this
extraordinary place
with someone   
with someone miraculous 
i told you
you d think it was crazy 
i just don t think
it s that simple 
nothing is 
everything is 
when you break it down 
 laughs 
i don t think it s crazy 
 chuckles 
that ll do 
for now 
 donna laughing 
 camera clicking 
 donna whooping 
 both laughing 
   thunder rumbling 
  it s done 
it s done  we re done 
it s over 
sophie  sophie  my darling 
everything will be okay 
apart from the fact that the
welcome decorations are down 
the garden is a swimming pool 
the swimming pool is a marsh 
we can take care
of all of that 
the party s still a day away 
what party 
i just got a call
saying that  because
of the storm last night 
no flights have come
into athens at all 
so there will be
no millionaire guests
at the not that grand opening 
which is just as well 
because the band
can t get here  either 
because the ferries
aren t running 
so there will be no one
to entertain
all the people
that aren t here anyway 
it really is over 
and i ve let everybody down 
no  no  no  that s not true 
especially mom 
nothing you do
could ever let her down 
trust me  i know 
how how do you know 
because i did let her down 
  the name of the game 
playing 
  i ve seen your eyes  
  tender like mine  
  only a week  
  since we started  
  it seems to me  
  in a short time  
  i m getting
more open hearted  
  i was an impossible case  
  no one ever could reach me  
  but i think i could see
in your face  
  there s a lot
you can teach me  
  so i wanna know  
  what s the name
of the game   
  your smile and the sound
of your voice  
  does it mean anything
to you   
  got a feeling 
you give me no choice  
  but it means a lot  
  what s the name
of the game   
  i was an impossible case  
  can you feel it
the way i do   
  tell me  please  
   cause i have to know  
  i m a curious child  
  beginning to grow  
 grunts 
 screams 
    and you make me tall  
   grunts  gasps 
    and you make me feel  
   groans  sighs 
  and you make me show  
  what i m trying to conceal  
  if i trust in you  
   grunts 
   bleating 
   gasps  screams 
    would you let me down   
  would you laugh at me  
  if i said i care for you   
  could you feel
the same way  too   
  i wanna know  
  oh  yes  i wanna know  
  the name of the game   
sam 
i went after her 
of course i did 
chased her all the way back
to the farmhouse 
sam 
wait  donna 
donna  donna  please 
  please just listen to me 
   groans 
  love to 
  you will 
yeah  of course 
i ll listen while you answer
three questions 
are you engaged
to that beautiful woman 
yes 
and did you tell me about it 
no 
and do you seriously think
  i could ever forgive you 
  please  donna 
  go 
  donna  please just listen to me 
that is enough listening  go 
 door slams 
  no more  
  carefree laughter  
  silence  
  ever after  
  walking through
an empty house  
  tears in my eyes  
  here is where
the story ends  
  this is good bye  
  knowing me  knowing you  
    uh huh  
    there is nothing  
  we can t do  
  knowing me  knowing you  
    uh huh  
    we just have  
    to face it this time  
    this time we re through  
    we re through  
    this time we re really through  
  this time we re through 
we re really through  
  breaking up is never easy 
i know  but i have to go     
  i have to go 
this time i have to go  
    this time i know  
    knowing me  knowing you  
  is the best i can do   
 crying softly 
 quiet chatter 
and now we turn  please 
to clause 47  item 12 
the wording here is unclear 
especially in reference to
 amortization
of accrued assets  
   man snoring 
  as the assets we discussed
are tangible  i advise
the more legitimate phrase 
 depreciation  
be used henceforth 
and furthermore   
  man  you are bored  mr  bright 
   snorts 
on the contrary 
nothing i like more
than a good   
contract negotiation 
especially one
that s been going on
for more than 14 hours 
this deal will make
your company
  the number one in europe 
   pouring drink 
worth taking time  i think 
absolutely  14 more hours 
bring them on 
that s a nice picture 
oh  my wife and daughter 
you have family 
i have a daughter 
best thing in my life 
so  to continue 
uh  clause 47  item 12 
as we said  the wording
is most unclear   
she really is
the best thing in my life 
this you already said 
yes  i m sorry 
i just realized something 
what  mr  bright 
what did you realize 
it s no use climbing the ladder
if you re on completely
the wrong wall 
the contract is marvelous 
by the way 
make any changes you like 
just sign  sign  sign  sign 
woman  his skill in writing
is matched only by his charm 
his sailing expertise
only by his charisma 
ladies and gentlemen 
please join me in welcoming
the wonderful bill anderson 
 crowd murmuring quietly 
 applause continues 
 applause quiets

i can t even tell him
how wrong it s all gone 
do you think he s just not
hearing the phone 
or that he s taking it
out of his pocket 
seeing it s you
and deciding not to answer 
it s wonderful that you put
that image in her head 
 whispers  
bolster  bolster 
i think his phone s on silent 
i don t even know what
i would say to him anyway 
you would say you love him more
than you love this argument 
  that s really good 
  i know 
i love him more
than any argument 
ooh 
just wish he was here
so i could tell him 
well  i wish bill was here 
too  so i could hit him 
what did go wrong with you two 
oh   
well  there was this
other woman hanging around 
i asked him about her  and   
you know you re in trouble
when the word  just 
comes before the word
 friends  
that s how most
of my marriages ended  too 
  one night  
  i was taking a walk  
    along the  
    river  
  when i saw him
together with  
  a young girl  
  and the look
that he gave her  
  made her shiver  
   cause he always used to  
  look at me that way  
    and i  
    and she thought  
    maybe  
    maybe she should  
  walk right up to her
and say  
  ah ha ha  
  it s a game
he likes to play  
  look into his angel eyes  
  one look
and you re hypnotized  
    he ll take your heart  
   men grunt 
  and you must pay the price  
  look into his angel eyes  
    whoa  
    you ll think  
    you re in paradise  
   man grunts 
  and one day
you ll find out  
  he wears a disguise  
  don t look too deep  
  into those angel eyes  
  oh  no  no  no  no  
  ah ha ha  
  ah ha ha  ha ha ha  
  ah ha ha  
it s terribly important
to remember   
  ah ha ha  ha ha ha  
   just what terrible people
all men are 
  ah ha ha  keep thinking  
  about his angel eyes  
  keep thinking  
  ah ah  
  sometimes when i m lonely  
  i sit and think about him  
  and it hurts to remember
all the good times  
  when i thought i could never
live without him  
  and i wonder 
does it have to be the same   
  every time when i see him  
  will it bring back
all the pain   
  ah ha ha  
  how can i forget that name   
  look into his angel eyes  
  one look
and you re hypnotized  
  he ll take your heart  
  and you must pay the price  
  look into his angel eyes  
  you ll think
you re in paradise  
  and one day you ll find out  
  he wears a disguise  
 rosie whimpers 
    don t look too deep

   men chuckle

mi amor 
méxico  1959 
  can you hear the drums 
fernando   
  i remember long ago  
  another starry night
like this  
  in the firelight  fernando  
  you were humming
to yourself  
  and softly strumming
your guitar  
  i could hear
the distant drums  
  and sounds of bugle calls
were coming from afar  
  they were closer now 
fernando  
  every hour  every minute  
  seemed to last eternally  
  i was so afraid  fernando  
  we were young
and full of life  
  and none of us
prepared to die  
  and i m not ashamed to say  
  the roar of guns and cannons
almost made me cry  
  there was something
in the air that night  
  the stars were bright 
fernando  
  they were shining there
for you and me  
  for liberty  fernando  
  though we never thought
that we could lose  
  there s no regret  
  if i had to do
the same again  
  i would  my friend 
fernando  
  if i had to do
the same again  
  i would  my friend 
fernando

fernando  
  since many years
i haven t seen  
  a rifle in your hand  
  can you hear the drums 
fernando   
  do you still recall
the fateful night  
  we crossed the rio grande   
  i can see it in your eyes  
  how proud you were to fight
for freedom in this land  
  there was something
in the air that night  
  the stars were bright 
fernando  
  they were shining there
for you and me  
  for liberty  fernando  
  though we never thought
that we could lose  
  there s no regret  
  if i had to do
the same again  
  i would  my friend 
fernando

the same again
