so it is nearly time
for the graduating year
to go out into the world
supported by their friends
and families
so many of whom they are
grateful to have in attendance
on this august day
but first custom dictates
that i call on
the undergraduate selected
by his or her peers
sorry sorry
to deliver
the valedictory address
this year that undergraduate
punctual as ever
sighs
is donna sheridan
cheering
youre going to do
great things donna
clears throat
thank you vicechancellor
for everything
this place
has taught me so much
about friendship
loyalty love
but most importantly
its taught me
that the best things in life
the very best things
happen unexpectedly
hit it
cheering
when i kissed the teacher
playing
everybody screamed
all whoop
when i kissed the teacher
all cheer
they must have thought
they dreamed
when i kissed the teacher
all my friends at school
whooping
they had never seen
the teacher blush
she looked like a fool
nearly petrified
cause she was
taken by surprise
when i kissed the teacher
couldnt quite believe
her eyes
when i kissed the teacher
my whole class went wild
whooping
as i held my breath
the world stood still
but then she just smiled
i was in the seventh heaven
when i kissed the teacher
whooping
what a mad day
ah ah ah
now i see everything
in a different light
what a mad day
i was up in the air
and she taught me
a lesson all right
kisses
i was in a trance
whooping
when i kissed the teacher
suddenly i took a chance
when i kissed the teacher
leaning over me
she was trying to explain
the laws of geometry
and i couldnt help it
i just had to kiss
the teacher
what a mad day
now i see everything
in a different light
what a mad day
gasping
i was up in the air
and she taught me
a lesson all right
what a crazy day
when i kissed the teacher
all my sense had flown away
when i kissed the teacher
my whole class went wild
as i held my breath
the world stood still
but then she just smiled
i was in the seventh heaven
when i kissed the teacher
i want to hug hug hug him
when i kissed the teacher
i want to hug hug him
when i kissed the teacher
i want to hug hug hug him
when i kissed the teacher
i want to hug hug him
when i kissed the teacher
cheering and applause

one of us playing

i want you to know
one of us is crying
one of us is lying
in her lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was
somewhere else instead
one of us is lonely
one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for himself
feeling stupid
feeling small
wishing he had never
left at all
i saw myself
as a concealed attraction
i felt you kept me away
from the heat
and the action
just like a child
stubborn and misconceiving
thats how i started
the show
one of us had to go
now ive changed
and i want you to know
one of us is crying
one of us is lying
in his lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing he was
wishing she was
somewhere else instead
one of us is lonely
one of us
one of us is lonely
one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for herself
feeling stupid
feeling small
wishing he had never
left at all

sophie
señor cienfuegos

doña tanya
hmm
your beauty comes not only
from the exquisite structure
of your bones
and the laughter
in your sparkling eyes
but from the goodness

sophie

uh reentrer dans la chambre
sil vous plaît mademoiselle
sorry i didnt understand
could you say all that again
oui
je suis
wait a second
i dont work here
well i should call the police
id rather you didnt
sets phone down
they probably wouldnt
understand my french anyway
donna
so harry you work in a bank
im afraid so
uh my father
more or less owns it
im fulfilling my destiny
donna sighs
im searching for mine
i have this feeling
its in greece
why greece
ill find out when i get there
leaving tomorrow
tomorrow
yeah
right better move fast
um
would you mind carrying your
bag on your other shoulder
uh sure why
well cause then you see
the hand nearest me
would fall straight down
and mine could sort of
brush against it
and then i could take
your hand in mine
in a totally natural
and spontaneous way
or you could just ask
to hold my hand
of course thats plan b
laughing
quiet chatter
piano playing gentle tune
donna
its not just greece generally
its a specific place
at the far end
theres an island kalokairi
and people used to think
if you sailed on from there
youd fall off the edge
of the world
that sounds like
the place for me
ofof course it does
absolutely
um but now perhaps we can
change the subject slightly
and talk about the advantages
and disadvantages of us
spending the night together
chuckling
whoa okay
bold move
because
from where im sitting
i mean it seems to be
pretty much all upside
withwith very little reason
not to just crack straight on
mmm
my family dont really
react well to foreign romances
years ago my mom
was in central america
and she had her heart broken
into a million little pieces
right
yeah fair enough
i mean
im sure youre correct
donna
mmm
i mean there is
one more reason though
youd be doing me
a huge favor because
yeah this
this would be my first time
laughs snorts
clears throat
youre kidding
no its a a thing
i always say
to make me look cool
no iim not kidding
clears throat
uh
sighs harry
we just met today
yes but when you know
you know
when you fall you fall
waterloo playing
and when youre defeated
by love
youre utterly defeated
whoa
my my
at waterloo
napoleon did surrender
oh yeah
and i have met my destiny
in quite a similar way
the history book
on the shelf
is always repeating itself
whooping
waterloo
i was defeated

oh my gasps
waterloo
promise to love you
forevermore
donna whoops
waterloo

ooh

chuckles
whoa whoa whoa whoa
waterloo
finally facing my waterloo
grunting
group hey hey
grunting continues
my my
i tried to hold you back
but you were stronger
oh yeah
whoops
group oh yeah
and now it seems
my only chance
is giving up the fight
crowd gasps

when i lose
waterloo
couldnt escape
if i wanted to
waterloo
knowing my fate
is to be with you
whoa whoa whoa whoa

indistinct chatter

thunder rumbling
rain pattering
donna sighs

theyre really sorry
they couldnt make it
if it had been
any other date
i know
but i have you
to tell you the truth
im not sure i can face it
i dont know if i can
either but we still will
because its a special night
not for mourning
but for celebration
sam chuckling
thats how mom
would have wanted it
she would have wanted
to be there
to get very drunk indeed
and dance until she dropped
chuckles
our dancing queen
yeah
it will get better
yeah
just not quite yet
ill see you later

so when youre near me

how can i
carry on
horn honks
indistinct chatter
donna
hey
sighs
you grew your hair
its longer now
it is a bit yeah
i know we could talk
about that
but uh the ferry
leaves any second and uh
i think great things
are waiting for me
i prefer it shorter
stamping
sighs
footsteps running
chuckles
wait wait
please
horn honking
dont oh god
turn around right now
its not too late
this is great
im just going to follow you
everywhere
by the end of the day
ill have a whole new wardrobe
i dont think thatll suit you
i say i can make it work
i really wanted
to catch that ferry
therell be another tomorrow
thanks
donna
right uh
but what would be
really great
today not tomorrow
is if uh
somewhere in this harbor
there was a guy
young tall
dashingly handsome
hes probably
passablelooking but
he has a boat
and a couple of days free
before he takes part
in a sailing race
so maybe he can take her
where she wants to go
hed love to
chuckles
but the sad fact is
thisthis isnt my boat
i just wanted to impress you
chuckles
oh okay
im kidding im kidding
jump on im bill
i actually have an elderly
relative on the island
who help
helped me buy this boat
there are two beds
but unfortunately
one of them is rather full
huh
convenient chuckles
you have one of those smiles
that makes
the rest of the world
smile too
laughing
its lucky this trip
is not long enough
for my fragile heart
to shatter completely
when you leave my boat
ugh i get it
youre one of them
one of who
there are two kinds of seducer
first doesnt actually
like women
so wants to assert
his power over them
but the second
and far more dangerous
is the guy who genuinely
falls in love every evening
only to fall out of it again
the next morning
but as you run away
you tell her
youre the one in pain
and shes just too much
for you to handle
like this
grunting
whoa
when you were lonely
playing
when you were lonely
you needed a man
scoffs
someone to lean on
laughing
well i understand
its only natural
sighs
but why did it
have to be me
oh just like that yes
nights can be empty
and nights can be cold
so you were looking
for someone to hold
thats only natural
laughing
but why did it
have to be me
i was so lonesome
i was blue
i couldnt help it
it had to be you and i
grunting
always thought you knew
the reason why
huh
laughing
bill chuckles
i only wanted
a little love affair
and now i can see
you are beginning to care
gasps
but baby believe me
its better
bill chuckles
to forget me
donna whoops
chuckles whoops
official
your hair
its shorter now
well yes
i had to cut it for work
i wonder could you please
hurry up a bit
uh you see ive followed
a girl all the way from paris
she wrote me a note
a very kind note
saying goodbye
but when youve found
the only girl you think
youre ever gonna love its
gotta be worth one more try
dont you think
its better short
men are the toys
in the game that you play
when you get tired
you throw them away
thats only natural
but why did it
have to be me
falling in love
with a woman like you
happens so quickly
chuckles
theres nothing to do
grunts
its only natural
but why did it
have to be me
we only just met
and youre not
that kind of girl
absolutely not
usually
man in distance
hey
what was that
nothing uh um a seagull
now where were we
its only natural
but why did it
have to be
man
hey
come on
grunts sighs
were coming
hi
just checking
youre not in danger
which youre obviously not
so well be off
uh my engine is not working
oh
oh that is bad luck
iill radio for someone
to come and help you
they should be along soon
bill
man please please
there is a woman waiting for me
on the mainland
her family
they not want her to marry
a simple fisherman like alexio
they want rich man
ugly fat big mole on face
but rich
but she

and i love her
with all my heartness
please help kind sir
and beautiful lady
with head full of curls
laughs
well obviously

yes

bill
i see them okay everyone

apollonia
whoa laughs
what are you doing
we could get you closer
if you love someone
youre willing to die for her
yeah but you dont have to
its an important distinction
chuckles
apollonia
alexio
aah apollon
hes just swallowed
a big mouthful of water
but the basic point
hes trying to make
is that he loves you
what
he loves you
alexio
apollonia
apollonia no apollonia
apollonia
apollonia
apollonia come back
laughs yes
apollonia
indistinct shouting
apollonia

i have a dream
a song to sing
to help me cope

of a fairy tale
gasps
chickens clucking
you can take the future
birds chirping

laughs oh
uh clears throat
so
we havent talked

you should know
that i never do that
that fast
i mean hardly ever
well sometimes
a bit recently in fact
but on the whole not
i thought it was miraculous
um im gonna say
something here
and you should shut up
as im saying it
because youll think
im crazy for a while
but gradually youll
youll realize im right
and then youll spend
the rest of your life
thanking me
for saving so much time
and just getting
straight to it
well im ready
i wasnt joking yesterday
i was serious
i want to stay here
and i think you should too
i think we should make a choice
to do something radical
and wonderful
to live in this
extraordinary place
with someone
with someone miraculous
i told you
youd think it was crazy
i just dont think
its that simple
nothing is
everything is
when you break it down
laughs
i dont think its crazy
chuckles
thatll do
for now
donna laughing
camera clicking
donna whooping
both laughing
thunder rumbling
its done
its done were done
its over
sophie sophie my darling
everything will be okay
apart from the fact that the
welcome decorations are down
the garden is a swimming pool
the swimming pool is a marsh
we can take care
of all of that
the partys still a day away
what party
i just got a call
saying that because
of the storm last night
no flights have come
into athens at all
so there will be
no millionaire guests
at the notthatgrand opening
which is just as well
because the band
cant get here either
because the ferries
arent running
so there will be no one
to entertain
all the people
that arent here anyway
it really is over
and ive let everybody down
no no no thats not true
especially mom
nothing you do
could ever let her down
trust me i know
howhow do you know
because i did let her down
the name of the game
playing
ive seen your eyes
tender like mine
only a week
since we started
it seems to me
in a short time
im getting
more openhearted
i was an impossible case
no one ever could reach me
but i think i could see
in your face
theres a lot
you can teach me
so i wanna know
whats the name
of the game
your smile and the sound

im a curious child
beginning to grow
grunts

crying softly
quiet chatter
and now we turn please
to clause 47 item 12
the wording here is unclear
especially in reference to
amortization
of accrued assets
man snoring
as the assets we discussed
are tangible i advise
the more legitimate phrase
depreciation
be used henceforth
and furthermore
man you are bored mr bright
snorts
on the contrary
nothing i like more
than a good
contract negotiation
especially one
thats been going on
for more than 14 hours
this deal will make
your company
the number one in europe
pouring drink
worth taking time i think
absolutely 14 more hours
bring them on
thats a nice picture
oh my wife and daughter
you have family
i have a daughter
best thing in my life
so to continue
uh clause 47 item 12
as we said the wording
is most unclear
she really is
the best thing in my life
this you already said
yes im sorry
i just realized something
what mr bright
what did you realize
its no use climbing the ladder
if youre on completely
the wrong wall
the contract is marvelous
by the way
make any changes you like
just sign sign sign sign
woman his skill in writing
is matched only by his charm
his sailing expertise
only by his charisma
ladies and gentlemen
please join me in welcoming
the wonderful bill anderson
crowd murmuring quietly
applause continues

friends
thats how most
of my marriages ended too
one night
i was taking a walk
along the
river
when i saw him
together with
a young girl
and the look
that he gave her
made her shiver
cause he always used to
look at me that way
and i
and she thought
maybe
maybe she should
walk right up to her
and say
ahhaha
its a game
he likes to play
look into his angel eyes
one look
and youre hypnotized
hell take your heart
men grunt
and you must pay the price
look into his angel eyes
whoa
youll think
youre in paradise
man grunts
and one day
youll find out
he wears a disguise
dont look too deep
into those angel eyes
oh no no no no
ahhaha
ahhaha hahaha
ahhaha
its terribly important
to remember
ahhaha hahaha
just what terrible people
all men are
ahhaha keep thinking
about his angel eyes
keep thinking
ahah
sometimes when im lonely
i sit and think about him
and it hurts to remember
all the good times
when i thought i could never
live without him
and i wonder
does it have to be the same
every time when i see him
will it bring back
all the pain
ahhaha
how can i forget that name
look into his angel eyes
one look
and youre hypnotized
hell take your heart
and you must pay the price
look into his angel eyes
youll think
youre in paradise
and one day youll find out
he wears a disguise
rosie whimpers

men chuckle
angel eyes

prepared to die

in the air that night

like an image passing by
my love my life
in the mirror of your eyes
my love my life
i can see it all so clearly
all i love so dearly
images passing by
like reflections
of your mind
my love my life
are the words i try to find
my love my life
but i know
i dont possess you
with all my heart
god bless you
you will be my love
and my life
youre my one and only
i held you close to me
felt your heart beat
and i thought i am free
oh yes
and as one are we
in the now and beyond
nothing and no one
can break
this bond
like an image passing by
my love my life
in the mirror of your eyes
my love my life
i can see it all so clearly
all i love so dearly
images passing by
like reflections
of your mind
my love my life
are the words i try to find
my love my life
but i know
i dont possess you
with all my heart
god bless you
you are still my love
and my life
yes i know
i dont possess you
with all my heart
god bless you
you are still my love
and my life
youre my one
and only
cheering and applause
rhythmic clapping
music swelling
i was sick and tired
of everything
when i called you
last night from glasgow
all i do is eat
and sleep and sing
wishing every show
was the last show
so imagine i was glad
to hear you coming
suddenly i feel all right
and suddenly
its gonna be
and its gonna be
so different
when im on the stage
tonight
tonight the super trouper
lights are gonna find me
shining like the sun
suppper trouppper
smiling having fun
suppper trouppper
feeling like a number one
tonight the super trouper
beams are gonna blind me
but i wont feel blue
suppper trouppper
like i always do
suppper trouppper
cause somewhere
in the crowd theres you
cheering
facing 20000
of your friends
how can anyone
be so lonely
part of a success
that never ends
still im thinking
about you only
there are moments
when i think im going crazy
but its gonna be all right
youll soon be changing
everything
everything will be
so different
when im on the stage
tonight
tonight the super trouper
lights are gonna find me
shining like the sun
suppper trouppper
smiling having fun
suppper trouppper
feeling like a number one

to me im still alive
and when you take me
