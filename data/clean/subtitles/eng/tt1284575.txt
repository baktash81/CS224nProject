the springfield trip is the best part of 7th grade
last years car wash raised 6000 dollars
bringing these magazines to school is not the way
you are going to make friends those 8th grade boys
are just using you

that right that you were showing movies all last week
hmm some clips maybe
but you know in a lot of ways
i think that movies are the new books
is this new
i love it
you knowive always said that
dolphins are the humans of the sea
i have a bumper sticker that says that
no way
im not kidding
its on my car
come on
hold on a sec
his name is simon and he lives
in the cayman islands
with his brother ajack
what a great story
what did you wanna talk about
i was thinking that i wanna get more involved
you knowi dont know something like maybe
supervising the 7th grade car wash
uhhyou know amy has been running after like
two years  yea but she does so much already
it might be nice to give her a little rest
its so nice to see you becoming a real
member of the jams family
it just feels so good to help
holy shit
alright lets do this
hey mr delacorte yes
hey kids
hey
hey you better not take it for a joyride
are you sure
im watching you
miss halseyim impressed
thanks ive been working out

god you know we should go get a drink tonight
i feel like getting drunk

i think i might be worth your while
youre worth the wait
i think so too
wally its amy squirrel
amy what are you do get out of here
this will just take a sec
ummi happen to be pedalling past
the 7th grade car wash this saturday
kill it can we talk about this later
later well all die said the gator to the fly
fuckk what
just go
now i dont want to speak out of school
but from where i was sitting i think
it seemed like miss halsey was getting
pretty chummy with the money
are you accusing elizabeth of embezzling
from the 7th grade car wash
wallywe barely know anything about her
hey you know what they raised almost 7000
so whatever she did worked lee mathews dad called
he said the car wash was a raging success
and lauren lismans dad called and he said
we should have car wash every weekend
so instead of accusing her
you might wanna ask her for some pointers
well if those pointers include
wearing provocative beach wear
for money i think ill pass
this is ridiculous this is the one place in this building
where im allowed to be alone with my thoughts
i only had this once a day
if im lucky
next time you accuse one of my teachers of stealing
you better have some evidence
god damnit we are done here
alrighty have a super awesome day you two
holy fuck i thought she was never gonna leave
whats going on with you
need a tissue huh
she is such a phony
yeah major phony
but she also cares a lot too
i love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles
i wanna sit on his face
hey guys

told me about this upcoming fake breasts job

hi im sashas mother
i am a little concerned at the importance youre
placing on movies
i was just wondering whats your plans
were for the state test
listen the school hired me because
im amazing at what i do
i use movies as one of my tools
but i also use a variety of
other multimedia techniques
listen i could take you day by day through
my entire syllabus but thats not just how i do things
so thats my spiel as the jews say
please help yourself to some
delicious snacks and drinks in the back
class dismissed

hi im morgans dad
morgan
great kid so precautious
i just wish morgans grades were reflected
if i know morgan and i think i do
ah morgan will get there
listen im sure you have full paid
along with a rocking hot body
but if you could just keep an eye on morgan
my wife and i would really appreciate it
for supplies and whatever
supplies
youre chases parents
you know a student like chase would
benefit so much from some extra attention
so you think we should hire a tutor
you know id be happy to do it myself
but its just so hard with a class of 20
25 or 30 whatever
to be a teacher
god it is so hard on my salary
to have to pay for my own supplies
and my fiance he cheated on me with his sister
as your personal tutor i guarantee
personally that she will get an a
or your money back

thought she saw
well this one student is in line to be editor
of the daily musket next year
shes got a lot to loose
going public with this
if the teachers union found out that i was administering
a drug test to a teacher with this little proof
they would make my life a living hell amy

and a year later when he left my
mom and moved in with his trainer

what happened to us
remember in the second grade when we
had a sleep over and you wet the bed

statement from earlier in the week was not true
what part of it exactly
all of it
pretty much
ive never seen this woman before in my life

to have a repeat of 2008
sit your ass down
a retest on cmon
do we really wanna tell our
young people
that if they study sacrifice
and achieve the highest scores
in the state
that theyre rewarded
with suspicion
i dont
i find these kind of accusations troubling
and quite frankly reckless
i worked my ass off for this school
and i know i am not perfect
but show me the perfect teacher
you cant
there are even teachers in
this very school who use drugs
they do they do use drugs
they do they do they do
wally do you remember how i told you
there are teachers here who use and abuse drugs
god damn it
and im hearing about this now
where is it axle

goodbye not only to another school year
but also to one of our own
amy squirrel after six short years
amy is transferring out of the district
speech speech
well
aaah wally thank you for those kind words
and thank you all
my decision that i made myself to leave
was super difficult
but when the superintendent personally ask you to work
at one of the worst school in the state
well you say yes
boy i am looking forward to bringing
my brand of genie energy
to those underprivileged students
at malcolm x high school
thank you
hey elizabethlisten since amys transferring
maybe the two of us can start over
oh hey therescott delacorte and you are
leaving
elizabeth
here
sign my yearbook
hold my ball sack
ill write my number down
just in case you need a lift
after the surgery
for second an extra set of hands to make sure
the implants are settling properly
thanks
hey aahyoure not gonna teach
again next year are you
i dont know
its the only thing im good at
im just saying maybe to consider doing
something else  like anything else
like any other job  in the entire world
you know the two of us
its never gonna happen
clearly
how would that even work
where do you even live in some weird
apartment with some creepy roommate
nomy creepy roommate moved out
so now its justjust me and the dogs
how many dogs do you have
four
four dogs
four dobermans
any family money
yea you bet
were talking like three figures
almost 700 bucks
so basically if i was gonna go out with you
i would be making the conscious choice
to be dating a gym teacher
who lives in a shack with four dogs
i prefer to think of it as two people
with amazing bodies
sharing those bodies with each other
giving each other the gift of these bodies
anyway actually none of these really matters
umm i sort of started seeing somebody
really thatscongratulations
i didnti didnt realize that so
those stupid so
im just fucking with you
guess i deserve that one
yea you must certainly did
i think its about time you realize
that the whole worlds just
see you around gym teacher
