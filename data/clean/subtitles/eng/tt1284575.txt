sandy gruber  c mon  now now guys it is not
a time to make silly jokes

we really get to the important part 
here we go  well it s been another
great year here at jams 
who can forget mr pinkus  haunted classroom
thank you sandy  for that 
and i ain t afraid of no ghosts 
or the wild success of
the book drive for women s prison
which mrs pavicic s class sponsored
thank you beth  but as summer draws upon us 
it s time not only to say goodbye to another school year
but sadly also to say goodbye
to one of our faculty members
yes   elizabeth  is elizabeth halsey here

elizabeth  even though you are
only with us for one short year

consider you part of the jams family 
and we got you a little something

but there s so much i will miss 
my students  probably most 
and i wish that i had gotten to know
all of you better 
but  between four classes and planning a wedding
my plate was full
still  i know that our students are
in good hands 
and even though i ll never teach again professionally 
i ve realised that i dont need a blackboard or
a classroom to set an example 
adios  bitches 
baby doll

in here  
get yourself hot coz i m gonna suck
your dick like i m mad at it
oh  look  your moms here 
hi mom  what a fun surprise

you truly love my son 
  i love him so much it hurts 
alright then  when is his birthday 
  mom

austin market 
okay fine  i ll sign the prenup 
it s over  elizabeth 
mark  i m pregnant 
  bullshit

okay fine  i m not actually pregnant 
you know what  i m starting to wonder    
whether this is always been about the money 
you never loved me 
i dont love you 
i have been listening to you
whining about opera for the last year 
okay  if the younger generation doesn t get into opera
then guess what  no more opera 
an art form has died
if opera goes away  we re fucked 
i want my ring back 
what am i supposed to do  huh 
where am i supposed to go 
3 months later
there she is  elizabeth halsey 
wooooo   
i am so excited we re gonna be across the hall mates 
but i m so sad  it s because
your relationship ended
who are you again 
  amy squirrel 
squirrel 
  yeah  you know 
don t worry  you were  kind of a long bolf last year
and so    busy planning the     wedding
i found him in bed with somebody else
  oh my gosh
it was a another man
  shut the front door 
look  i know you kinda skated by last year
doing the bare minimum thing
but i just wanna say  now you re back  i just know
you are gonna get your teaching on
i thought the teachers were supposed
to get the apples
well  i think the students teach me
at least as much as i teach them
that s just something i say sometimes
  stupid 
uh sorry  i just wanted to know
if you wanted to grab some lunch
i m kind of in the middle of something  lynn
  my treat 
you know  lynn
when i first started teaching
i thought that i was doing it
for all the right reasons
shorter hours  summers off 
no account credibility   
oh  i love my summers   
fresh corn    mmmm
from now on  my full time job is finding
a guy who s gonna take care of me
god i pray for that
you know i spent my entire summer
hanging out at bars near where the bulls practice
had some fun  got some cool souvenirs
but those guys are not looking to settle down
i mean   they all wear condoms  then  they take
the condoms with them  that s how paranoid they are
like it s so easy to get pregnant from
some dude nutting into a condom
yeaa    ugh  you re gonna find someone great
right 
i ve been thinking about it a lot  i m like an 8 
8 and a half  but if i got a new pair of tits   right

you re already so pretty
you have no idea how difficult it is to
compete against these barbie doll types

the auditorium

  i am the student leader for the trip to springfield
shocker 
  we re having our carwash this weekend
if you re around  maybe we could
wash your car 
the springfield trip is the best part of 7th grade   
   last year s car wash raised 6000 dollars
bringing these magazines to school is not the way
you are going to make friends  those 8th grade boys  
are just using you
so i go now 
  yes  you go now 
but if i see these again 
i m gonna call your parents
do you understand 
go to class 
hey hey  hey  go to class 
another exciting day in the principal s office
do you have a second 
uhh yeah  oh  you know what i wanna talk to you too  did i hear
that right  that you were showing movies all last week 
hmm   some clips  maybe
but you know in a lot of ways
i think that movies are the new books
is this new 
i love it
you know i ve always said that
dolphins are the humans of the sea
i have a bumper sticker that says that
  no way 
i m not kidding 
it s on my car 
come on   
hold on a sec   
his name is simon and he lives
in the cayman islands  
with his brother  ajack
what a great story 
  what did you wanna talk about 
i was thinking that i wanna get more involved
you know  i don t know    something like    maybe  
supervising the 7th grade car wash 
uhh  you know amy has been running after like  
two years   yea  but she does so much already 
it might be nice to give her a little rest
it s so nice to see you becoming a real
member of the jams family 
it just feels so good to help 
holy shit 
  alright  let s do this 
hey  mr  delacorte  yes 
hey  kids 
  hey  
hey  you better not take it for a joyride
  are you sure 
  i m watching you 
miss halsey  i m impressed 
  thanks  i ve been working out 
what a turn out 
  oh yeah  the kids are just having a blast
well  that s what it s all about 
god  you know we should go get a drink tonight
i feel like getting drunk
i mean not  drunk  drunk  strong buzz
still be able to drive 
i m sorry    i can t get em    just not ready
but if you re patient  
i think i might be worth your while
  you re worth the wait
  i think so too
wally  it s amy squirrel 
  amy  what are you do     get out of here 
this will just take a sec   
umm  i happen to be pedalling past
the 7th grade car wash this saturday
  kill it  can we talk about this later 
  later we ll all die said the gator to the fly
fuckk  what 
  just go
now  i don t want to speak out of school
but   from where i was sitting  i think    
it seemed like miss halsey was getting
pretty chummy with the money
are you accusing elizabeth of embezzling
from the 7th grade car wash 
wally  we barely know anything about her
  hey  you know what they raised almost  7000 
so whatever she did  worked  lee mathews dad called 
he said the car wash was a raging success 
and lauren lisman s dad called and he said
we should have car wash every weekend 
so instead of accusing her 
you might wanna ask her for some pointers 
well if those pointers include
wearing provocative beach wear  
  for money  i think i ll pass 
this is ridiculous  this is the one place in this building
where i m allowed to be alone with my thoughts
i only had this once a day  
if i m lucky 
next time you accuse one of my teachers of stealing 
you better have some evidence 
god damnit  we are done here 
alrighty  have a super awesome day  you two 
holy fuck  i thought she was never gonna leave 
what s going on with you 
need a tissue  huh 
she is such a phony 
  yeah  major phony
but she also cares a lot too 
i love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles 
  i wanna sit on his face 
hey  guys 
  heyy 
lynn  will you go grab me some milk 
  what kind of milk do you want 
the skim  whole  2    chocolate 
surprise me 
  okay  i ll get you skim  no 2    
so   
  holla  fellow educators  
is everything okay with gaby 
  she will be fine 
i told her  gaby if you re not happy with yourself 
you can t expect others to be happy with you 
it starts with you 
  i m sure she appreciated that 
and it s exactly what i told elizabeth when she
told me about this upcoming fake breasts job 
sorry    sorry i thought you were telling everyone 
did you 
well i m prochoice  i believe everyone should choose
whatever makes them happiest  
except abortion  of course 
of course 
  of course 
looks like algebra is calling 
i hate math  wish me luck 
hi  i m a math terrortist
with close ties to algebra
i have weapons of
maths instruction
here  i ll walk you 
  man  everyone is so nice around here 
of course  hey watch my quadrant 
here you go   1      surprise 
hi  my name is elizabeth halsey 
any questions 
hi  i m sasha s mother 
i am a little concerned at the importance you re
placing on movies 
i was just wondering whats your plans
were for the state test 
listen  the school hired me because   
i m amazing at what i do
i use movies as one of my tools
but i also use a variety of
other multimedia techniques
listen  i could take you day by day through
my entire syllabus  but that s not just how i do things 
so  that s my spiel  as the jews say 
please  help yourself to some
delicious snacks and drinks in the back 
class dismissed 
  excuse me  miss halsey 
hi  i m morgan s dad 
morgan 
great kid  so precautious 
  i just wish morgan s grades were reflected 
if i know morgan  and i think i do 
ah     morgan will get there 
listen  i m sure you have full paid
along with a rocking hot body 
but if you could just keep an eye on morgan 
my wife and i would really appreciate it 
for supplies and whatever 
supplies 
you re chase s parents 
you know a student like chase would
benefit so much from some extra attention 
so you think we should hire a tutor 
you know i d be happy to do it myself 
but it s just so hard with a class of 20  
25 or 30  whatever 
  to be a teacher 
god  it is so hard on my salary
to have to pay for my own supplies
and my fiance  he cheated on me with his sister
as your personal tutor  i guarantee
personally that she will get an a 
or your money back
say no more 
make it out to cash

  of physical education 
at harvard  but

do you have any proof other than what one student
thought she saw 
well this one student is in line to be editor
of the daily musket next year 
she s got a lot to loose
going public with this
if the teacher s union found out that i was administering
a drug test to a teacher with this little proof   
they would make my life a living hell  amy

that s it 
amy  stop that

manipulating you through the use of dolphins

that wrote me a card
when my dad was overweight and
had to go to the hospital because of his heart
and a year later  when he left my
mom and moved in with his trainer    
you wrote me another card 
what happened to us 
remember  in the second grade when we
had a sleep over and you wet the bed 
and you were so embarassed  and you made me
promise never to tell anyone

garrett portman  i was a kid from
an old boys school

mr  halabi  thank you for your time

statement from earlier in the week was not true
what part of it  exactly 
all of it  
pretty much
i ve never seen this woman before in my life
baloney
  you seem  very certain a couple of days ago 
i did  because    umm   
i m a casual drug user

knows it  so  
that explains me  making
absolutely no sense
thank you

an innocent teacher get hurt

retest 
retest  retest 
damn it  squirrel   i am not going
to have a repeat of 2008 
sit your ass down 
a retest on  c mon
do we really wanna tell our
young people    
   that if they study  sacrifice    
   and achieve the highest scores
in the state   
   that they re rewarded
with suspicion 
i don t 
i find these kind of accusations troubling
and quite frankly  reckless 
i worked my ass off for this school 
and i know i am not perfect 
but show me the perfect teacher 
you can t 
there are even teachers in
this very school who use drugs 
they do  they do use drugs
  they do  they do  they do
wally  do you remember how i told you 
there are teachers here who use and abuse drugs 
god damn it 
and i m hearing about this now 
where is it axle

axle s barking at the wrong tree there
ma am  please don t touch the dog

well it s been another great year
here at jams
with summer round the corner  it s time to say
goodbye not only to another school year  
   but also to one of our own 
amy squirrel  after six short years 
amy is transferring out of the district
speech  speech
  well  
aaah  wally thank you for those kind words 
and thank you all
my decision that i made myself to leave
was super difficult 
but when the superintendent personally ask you to work
at one of the worst school in the state 
well    you say  yes 
boy  i am looking forward to bringing
my brand of genie energy  
  to those underprivileged students
at malcolm x high school 
thank you 
hey  elizabeth  listen  since amy s transferring 
maybe the two of us can start over
oh  hey there  scott delacorte  and you are 
  leaving 
  elizabeth 
  here 
  sign my yearbook 
  hold my ball sack
i ll write my number down
just in case you need a lift   
  after the surgery 
for second  an extra set of hands to make sure
the implants are settling properly
thanks
hey  aah   you re not gonna teach
again next year  are you 
i don t know  
it s the only thing i m good at
i m just saying maybe   to consider doing
something else     like anything else
like any other job     in the entire world
you know  the two of us   
it s never gonna happen 
  clearly 
  how would that even work 
where do you even live  in some weird
apartment with some creepy roommate 
no   my creepy roommate moved out 
so now it s just  just me   and the dogs
how many dogs do you have 
  four 
four dogs 
  four dobermans
any family money 
  yea  you bet 
we re talking like three figures  
almost 700 bucks
so  basically  if i was gonna go out with you 
i would be making the conscious choice   
  to be dating a gym teacher
who lives in a shack with four dogs 
i prefer to think of it as two people
with amazing bodies   
   sharing those bodies with each other
giving each other the gift of these bodies
anyway  actually none of these really matters
umm    i sort of   started seeing somebody
really that s  congratulations
i didn t  i didn t realize that so    
  those stupid    so  
  i m just fucking with you
guess i deserve that one   
  yea  you must certainly did
i think it s about time you realize 
that the whole world s just   
see you around gym teacher 
hey  
let s do that again 
three months later 
hey  elizabeth 
  hey lynn  how was your summer 
oh it was great  i went to the zoo

your titties

cause i don t even need them 
plus they re really expensive  you know  per tit
  yea  and you got to get two of them
and i met a guy 
  oh  tell me everything 
did you find your prince charming 
something like that
