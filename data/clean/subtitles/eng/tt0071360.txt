jack tar hotel

i don t know anything about
human nature or curiosity

bless me  father 
for i have sinned 
it s been three months
since my last confession 
i   
these are my sins 
i ve taken
the lord s name in vain   
on several occasions 
i   
on a number of occasions  i ve
taken newspapers from the racks   
without paying for them 
i   
have deliberately taken pleasure
in impure thoughts   
and   
i ve been involved
in some work   
that i think will be used   
to hurt these two young people 
it s happened to me before 
people were hurt
because of my    my work 
i m    i m afraid
it could happen again   
and i    i was in no way
responsible 
i m not responsible 
for these and all the sins
of my past life   
i am heartily sorry 
hi  can i help you 
you could explain
your system to me 
mr caul

how do you do 
come in and take a look
at the system

if you re in surveillance 
you belong into the lt 500 
you can hear   
and know exactly which door
has been violated 
and you got your local alarms
on the doors   
which i m sure you ve heard 
it s quite noisy 
it has a super 8mm
camera in here   
and the dot  the 10 00 dot   
will show exactly what
the camera sees on the back 
it s a magazine loaded camera

a new scrambler  harry 
this went out
with the trojan war 
come on 
i want to hear all about you 
really obsolete  you know that 
harry got himself a girlfriend 
watch out  harry 
where are you from 
new york 
i used to live in new york 
first i worked
as a receptionist   
and then i got
promoted to secretary 
and then i was promoted
to gal friday   
and special assistant
to the boss   
and then i married him 
do you live far from here 
harry 
are you still married 
oh  i don t know 
probably 
i guess maybe i am 
last time i heard   
well  he was trying to
scrape up enough money   
to buy another hardware store 
yeah 
and i ended up out here
in san francisco  unemployed   
which is the entire story
of my life   
up until tonight 
here s to you  salute 
you don t like me
very much  do you 
you don t want to
talk to me or anything 
i didn t say that 
something is on your mind 
i wish you d tell me 
i really do 
i wish that you d feel
that you could talk to me   
and that we could be friends 
i mean aside from
all of this junk 
would you  um   
if you were a girl who d
waited for someone   
you can trust me 
well  you never really knew   
when he was going to
come to see you 
you just lived in a room alone   
and you knew nothing about him 
and if you loved him   
and were patient with him   
and even though
he didn t dare ever   
tell you anything
about himself personally   
even though he may
have loved you   
would you   
would i what 
would you   
would you go back to him 
well  how would i know   
how would i know
that he loved me 
you d have no way of knowing 
hey  harry 
did you hear the one about
the broad who busted vegas 
she wore a see through blouse 
where are you going 
hey  hey 
you know something  harry 
12 years ago  i recorded
every telephone call   
made by the
presidential nominee   
of a major political party 
i don t want to say which party 
everywhere he went 
that s where i was 
coast to coast  i was listening 
i m not saying i elected   
the president of
the united states   
but you can draw
your own conclusions 
i mean  he lost 
harry  tell them
about the time   
you put the bug
in the parakeet 
parakeet 
no kidding 
harry one time actually
put a microphone   
in a little parakeet 
is that right 
parakeets don t happen
to be my thing   
but i sure would
like to know   
how you did
the teamster local back in  68 
what was that 
don t you get papers
in chicago  millard 
probably out on strike 
it was all over the front pages 
harry was working
for the attorney general 
you didn t know i knew  did you 
the president of
this teamster local   
set up a phoney welfare fund 
i mean  you correct me
on the details  harry 
i may be a little fuzzy 
only two people seemed to know   
the president and his accountant 
they only talked about it
on fishing trips 
on a private boat   
that was the only place
they talked details 
that boat was bug proof 
that s a fact 
they wouldn t strike up
a conversation   
if there was another boat
on the horizon 
that didn t stop harry  did it 
no  he recorded everything 
nobody knows
how you did it though 
caused a hell of a scandal 
why 
no reason 
three people were murdered 
harry s a bit too modest
to tell us how he did it 
it had nothing to do with me 
i just turned in the tapes 
the president thought
the accountant talked 
nobody really knows for sure 
three days later   
they found the accountant 
his wife  and kid   
naked and tied up in the house   
hands and feet
tied up with rope   
all the hair on their bodies
shaved off 
the heads were found
in different places 
they killed them 
no  they gift wrapped them 
this is ancient history now 
harry  how d you do it 
what they do with the tapes
is their business 
next thing i knew 
you moved out of new york 
it had nothing to do with me 
come on  show and tell 
how d you do it 
for god s sake  tell him 
turn it off  stan 
what for 
stan  turn it off 
they ought to hear this 
it s the best thing
you ve ever done 
what was that  stan 
well  it s the assignment
that harry did this week 
it ll make history 
yeah 
there s no moment between
human beings that i cannot record   
and there s no method
that i cannot figure out 
i could figure out
any of harry s schemes  right 
come on  come on  try me 
let me give him
the assignment  harry 
yeah 
this is a quad
in the centre of the city 
these are steps 
benches all around 
it s 12 00 noon   
which means
that it s lunchtime   
for the people working
in these offices 
they re walking  talking 
having lunch   
and it s crowded 
naturally  come on  stan 
okay  two people are constantly
moving in circles   
in and out of the crowd 
we don t know whether
they ll sit down or what 
they re convinced
they can t be recorded   
because they re in a crowd
and constantly moving 
yet  they re the target 
the assignment is
to get everything they say 
how would you do it 
one system won t do it 
i could ve told you that 
why didn t you 
go on  figure it out 
you get to their clothes first 
you pre rig their clothes 
there s no way of telling   
what they re
going to be wearing 
get somebody to bump into them 
get a drunk to plant
a pin mike on them 
they ve been bugged before 
it s too risky 
i got it 
you hire a lip reader
with binoculars 
no  the client wants
their actual voice 
why 
so he can believe it 
all right  i ll figure it out 
i don t know 
it must ve been an expensive show 
who was so interested 
yeah  was it us 
who s us 
federal government 
private party 
it would take
at least four passes 
i did it in three 
three  that s very nice 
what did you use 
three stage directional
microphones   
with mosfet amplifier
of my own design 
we got another 20  conventionally
just tailing them 
paul did 
it was beautiful 
it really was 
it was a work of art 
you should have
seen it  though 
these new microphones
are just incredible 
i couldn t believe it myself 
we were 200 yards away 
it was absolutely readable 
i broke in a couple
of newsreel cameramen 
you should have
been there  bernie 
what did they do 
they took the cross hairs
of the telescope   
and lined it up on the mouths   
no  the boy and the girl 
what did they do 
oh  i don t know 
but it was beautiful 
something to see 
yeah  sounds very pretty 
i d like to take
a look at that mike  too 
there it is 
oh 
i always said
we should be partners  harry 
you re the best  but you
and me together  that d be tops 
i need a quick look at
your plans and devices 
i got all the
manufacturing plants
