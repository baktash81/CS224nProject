coach du pont has a vision 
he would like foxcatcher
to be designated and recognized
as the official training site
for u s a  wrestling
and the olympic team 
now  this means that the national team
would live here and train here 
on top of funding this program 
coach du pont would be willing
to make a donation to u s a  wrestling
of  500 000 per year 
  that s fantastic 
  yeah  that s really nice 
mr  du pont 
thank you very much for   
the spirit of foxcatcher 
it is a philosophy
which began generations ago 
  thank you 
  it is more than just sport 
and coaching these young athletes 
i am able to instill in them
the lessons that i have learned in life 
athletes need role models 
like anyone 
they need people to look up to 
a coach is a father 
a coach is a mentor 
a coach has great power   
great import on an athlete s life 
we ll put you in a house
with another wrestler 
gym s a hundred yards from it 
there s plenty of places
for the kids to run around 
hey  mark  i ll just be   
all right  i ll tell her you said hey 
i m waiting
to hear from you  bye 
hey  buddy 
hey 
warm up  i ll be out there in a minute 
yeah  i just   
i gotta make one more call 
look 
i don t wanna be here 
i called coach beacham at byu 
he said he d take both of us 
we don t got time
to make a big change like that 
okay  what about after seoul 
mark   
look  i don t know
what s gonna happen in the future 
but nancy and i would like to try
and make it work here 
you and i both know
that i can t stay here 
i know  mark 
hey  do you remember
when we were kids 
you remember how we lived 
moving all over the place 
never had any idea
where or how long
we were gonna be anywhere 
remember how that was
for us 
was it easy for us 
no 
that s my responsibility
to my family  mark 
i know you understand that 
keep your head
in the game  mark 
go on down 
hi  dave  i m doc 
doc  dave schultz 
nice to meet you 
have a seat in the chair here 
if you would 
we re rolling 
let s talk a bit
about his philosophy as a coach 
what is his philosophy
as the individual that s gonna
lead this team and you 
well  john s philosophy as a coach
is to let the wrestlers   
um   
sorry 
is to  um  create an environment
where  uh  the athlete
doesn t have many obstacles
to get past to be great 
let s get pointed here  i   
i m not doing what you want me to 
let s get pointed 
what are you looking for 
you know what we re trying
to accomplish 
we re making a documentary that shows
john is gonna be able to lead this team 
lead you to levels of greatness
in wrestling we haven t seen before 
and talk about that  but use
some of those terms that he likes 
like  excellent  and  intensity 
and  domination  
all right 
well  john du pont   
say that again  i m sorry 
can you ask me that question again 
john sees you as important to this 
you re the closing chapter to this thing 
you re the end of it 
and you re his assistant coach 
he sees himself as your mentor 
i would like you
to just look at the camera
and speak about john   
as a mentor 
and say what exactly 
that he s your mentor 
can you do that 
john du pont   
is kind of a mentor to me 
just look over here at the camera
and say it again 
john du pont is a mentor to me 
i thought maybe it d be a good idea
if we talked  kind of clear the air 
i wanna make sure you guys
are clear that we expect
that mr  du pont is gonna be
in mark s corner throughout
the olympic games 
well  we can ask him
if that s okay  but first 
i d like to raise a few things
that are important to me 
one  if i m gonna   
commit to staying on here
at foxcatcher 
i need to know
that mark s gonna be taken care of 
well  taken care of how 
so long as i m at foxcatcher 
mark s gonna get paid 
you want him to be paid
even if he s not here 
yeah  that s pretty much it 
dave  you may be overestimating
your importance to foxcatcher 
well  that may be so 
we could test that 
but i m here to say  john 
i wanna continue
what we ve started here at foxcatcher 
and it s important to me
that i know that my brother
is gonna be supported 
thanks  john 
okay  you ll get your
deal  you ll get your demands 
but this means that mr  du pont
is gonna be seated in mark s corner
throughout the olympic games 
i wanna hear mark agree
to that himself 
remember what
we went over today  mark 
you can t do this to yourself  buddy 
you can t do this to yourself 
you can beat this guy  mark 
you can beat him 
can i help you 
  everything okay 
  can i help you 
  uh  yeah  we live here 
  okay 
there s a new security plan in place 
i m gonna need to see some ids 
sure 
hey  john  it s sunday 
it s family time 
morning  john 
say hi to john 
hi  john 
it s sunday 
every athlete  no matter what sport 
needs structure 
needs direction 
and this is something
that a coach can offer 
as a coach 
i hope to develop young athletes 
not only in body  but in mind 
i want you to be champions
in sport and winners in life 
and also  good citizens of america 
you will be representing foxcatcher 
you will be representing
the united states 
the coach is there
to help the athlete succeed
in all the ways that
that athlete should be able to succeed 
and in doing so
that coach is able
to create a champion 
my athletes look to me
as a brother  a mentor 
a father and a leader 
i spent my lifetime
looking for a father 
and i have found one
in the golden eagle of america
