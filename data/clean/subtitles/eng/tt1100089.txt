coach du pont has a vision
he would like foxcatcher
to be designated and recognized
as the official training site
for usa wrestling
and the olympic team
now this means that the national team
would live here and train here
on top of funding this program
coach du pont would be willing
to make a donation to usa wrestling
of 500000 per year
thats fantastic
yeah thats really nice
mr du pont
thank you very much for
the spirit of foxcatcher
it is a philosophy
which began generations ago
thank you
it is more than just sport
and coaching these young athletes

the lessons that i have learned in life
athletes need role models

a coach is a father
a coach is a mentor

lets talk a bit
about his philosophy as a coach
what is his philosophy
as the individual thats gonna
lead this team and you
well johns philosophy as a coach
is to let the wrestlers
um
sorry
is to um create an environment
where uh the athlete
doesnt have many obstacles
to get past to be great
lets get pointed here i
im not doing what you want me to
lets get pointed
what are you looking for
you know what were trying
to accomplish
were making a documentary that shows
john is gonna be able to lead this team
lead you to levels of greatness
in wrestling we havent seen before
and talk about that but use
some of those terms that he likes
like excellent and intensity
and domination
all right
well john du pont
say that again im sorry
can you ask me that question again
john sees you as important to this
youre the closing chapter to this thing
youre the end of it
and youre his assistant coach
he sees himself as your mentor
i would like you
to just look at the camera
and speak about john
as a mentor
and say what exactly
that hes your mentor
can you do that
john du pont
is kind of a mentor to me
just look over here at the camera
and say it again
john du pont is a mentor to me

if we talked kind of clear the air
i wanna make sure you guys
are clear that we expect
that mr du pont is gonna be
in marks corner throughout
the olympic games
well we can ask him
if thats okay but first
id like to raise a few things
that are important to me
one if im gonna
commit to staying on here
at foxcatcher
i need to know
that marks gonna be taken care of
well taken care of how
so long as im at foxcatcher
marks gonna get paid
you want him to be paid
even if hes not here
yeah thats pretty much it
dave you may be overestimating
your importance to foxcatcher
well that may be so
we could test that
but im here to say john
i wanna continue
what weve started here at foxcatcher
and its important to me
that i know that my brother
is gonna be supported
thanks john
okay youll get your
deal youll get your demands
but this means that mr du pont
is gonna be seated in marks corner
throughout the olympic games
