that s not going to do
us much good for tonight 
why haven t you been in
touch with her before now 
because before i was born
there was this bad blood
between her and my mom  and
there must have been some harsh
words spoke because my mom was supposed
to have thrown this chemical
in her face that burned
her skin a little bit 
lovely 
i tried to get her on the phone once 
but she ain t listed 
if i could just get up

just after you left  the
pigs came and pinched
mom and larry both

just like last time 
so  how did you get here

you having some kind of trouble 
yeah  the fucking cocksucker won t
even fucking turn over 
excuse my bad language  sir 
it s all right 
mind if i take a look at it 
yeah  go for it 
why don t you get behind the wheel there
and step on the gas for me 
try it 
again 
well  i hate to be the one
to break the news to you 
but this car has had it 
i knew it was only a matter of time 
where you headed 
my grandma is up in stockton 
well  i m going as far as la 
you re more than welcome to
ride with me if you like 
really  mister 
sure 
why don t you grab your
stuff and let s go 
thanks 
i guess we ought to
call a tow truck  huh 
nah  cal trans will take care of it 
i know my mom used to
work part time for them 
so  what do i call you 
i m sorry 
my name is bob wolverton 
hi  i m vanessa lutz 
nice to meet you  vanessa 
why don t you put on your
safety belt and we ll get going 
great 
what s this all about 
it s a psychological
manual i use at my work 
i m a counselor at a school for
boys with emotional trouble 
just boys  huh 
no girls at all 
i m afraid so 
so  how does your family feel about
this trip of yours up to stockton 
i don t got no family
just at the moment 
vanessa  everybody s got family 
shows how much you know 
you want to talk about it 
not really 
i m sorry 
it s an unfortunate habit of mine 
sticking my nose in where
it doesn t really belong 
that s a bad habit 
well  don t rub it in okay 
it s just my work 
i see a kid who looks
like they re in trouble
and i start asking all kinds of questions 
i guess it s just become second nature 
it s that obvious 
what is 
me being in trouble 
look  the offer s still
open if you want it 
you know  i ve always found it
amazing how  how much easier
it is to really share something
with a perfect stranger 
stuff that you couldn t even talk to with
your best friend or your family 
yeah  i noticed that 
that s real funny  isn t it 
yeah  it is 
most of the kids i work
with  i don t even have
to press them to talk about themselves 
i just let them know i m there
and that they can talk about
themselves if they want to 
well  i guess my biggest problem
right now is  my mamma is in jail 
vanessa  that sounds like
a pretty bad situation 
yeah  that s why i m
going to see my grandma 
you mind me asking why
your mother s in jail 
it s pretty embarrassing 
vanessa  why would you be embarrassed
about another person s acts 
i don t know 
it s just 
i don t feel comfortable
talking about stuff like that 
i think it makes me look
like a low type person 
i can understand that 
you know  most of the boys i work with 
even the most troubled ones 
all they really need is just
someone to listen to them 
yeah  but you probably
get so sick of hearing
them sad stories day in and day out 
i don t 
i really love my work 
i really do 
i couldn t imagine myself
doing anything else 
not ever 
i guess i wouldn t
mind talking to someone 
just wouldn t know where to begin 
why don t you begin with your mother 
i mean  if you want to 
my mamma s a whore 
thanks  mister 
i mean  bob 
there 
i can t believe i m
telling you all this stuff 
my mamma s in jail 
it looks like my stepfather s
next parole officer
ain t even been born yet 
vanessa  you really
don t have anyone  do you 
that s terrible 
oh  that s just terrible 
my real dad was this
merchant marine out in texas 
but he got stabbed to death
on one of them container ships
by this man from pakistan 
before i was born 
you want to see his picture 
i got it right here 
  absolutely 
that s my daddy 
he looks very interesting 
  you think 
  absolutely 
i think so  too 
vanessa  your grandmother
is going to be very proud when
she finds out what a wonderful
granddaughter she s got 
but i have to be honest with you 
i think given your present situation 
maybe foster care would be the
way you should go right now 
oh bob 
you don t know 
you know  sometimes them places are okay 
but most of the time 
them people are just in it for the check
that the state sends for your upkeep 
i take it you ve had
some bad experiences 
the last one i was in 
there was this old man there
that everyone called grandpa
and he had this disease called
 wiesenheimer s   i think it was 
where your brain cells
run out into your pee 
yes  it s a form of senility 
  here s your check sir 
  thank you 
thanks  bob 
that s the best fucking
dinner i ve had all month 
wouldn t mind stretching
my legs for a little while
before i got behind the wheel 
do you mind 
no  sure 
i got all the time in the world 
great 
so  them foster parents  the morales 
i mean you would have
thought a check from the state
would ve been enough  but no 
they figured on me helping
out with grandpa  too 
you mean  you actually had
to provide care for this man 
get crucial 
this guy was pissing his
sheets nearly every night 
just being near him made me
want to puke my guts out 
so  what happened when you refused 
they just started treating me
like i was the biggest
bitch who d ever been born 
and this one night  just
a couple of weeks after
i d been placed there 
i woke up to see grandpa
standing over me with his cane in one hand
and his you know what in the other 
my god 
what happened 
i told him to get the hell out 
i take it he didn t 
nah  that s when he tried to slip in
in under the covers with me 
i just went crazy on him 
what do you mean  you went crazy 
i was pissed off because
i couldn t see my mom
and just having this perv standing over me
wagging his thing in my face
was just like the last straw 
so what did you do 
well  got up on my knees and just
slapped his dentures half out of his face 
then i dropped down on his chest
and just started wailing on him 
beating him up so hard 
swearing so loud 
my god 
yeah 
so then  the lights
went on and mr  morales
showed up in his pajamas 
well  thank god he was there 
yeah  right 
he hit me so hard i had
to have my jaw wired shut
for nearly three months 
broke my nose too 
that s how come it s so big 
vanessa  your nose is not big 
it s pretty damn big 
was this man ever punished 
are you kidding 
a pillar of society like mr  morales 
nah 
but my mom got out of rehab
a couple of days later 
so i didn t have to go back or nothing 
you were telling me a while ago
your step dad was on parole 
oh  yeah 
larry s been in lots of pens 
like this one federal place
up in illinois    marion 
it s mostly for drug shit 
manufacturing methamphetamines 
stolen property 
nothing real  real bad 
vanessa  please don t be
offended by my next question 
but  um   
did your stepfather molest you 
oh  my god 
you know  this lady police woman
just asked me that very same
question just a few hours ago 
and how did that make you feel 
like i got daddy s fuck
hole tattooed on my forehead 
maybe this is an issue
you should explore 
i never even told my
fiancé about this stuff 
vanessa  if you keep something
like this bottled up inside 
it could wreck your whole life 
now you re scaring me 
it s not my intention 
i just think you have a
very good opportunity now
to get through
some of the trauma and anguish
you ve been suffering from
for such a long time 
i do got trauma  huh 
let s not kid ourselves  vanessa 
i ve been so anguished 
i can t even remember being happy 
vanessa  you have to
look this pain in the eye 
otherwise  it could rule over
every aspect of your life 
now  i think i can help you 
but you re going to have to trust me 
you re going to have to let me in 
my god you re cold 
just thinking about my
fucked up life is all 
let s go 
i m sorry 
here i m blubbering like a big old baby 
and you re just trying to help me 
vanessa  vanessa  just take your time 
take your time 
i was 11 when larry first hit on me 
where was your mother 
some stupid halfway house 
how did the abuse begin 
with my mamma gone  i
had all these extra chores
i had to do  like the laundry 
the groceries and things like that 
so  in effect you became
the woman of the house 
yeah 
yeah 
i was so proud of myself 
and then this one night  we
was watching tv after dinner 
like we always do  and
that s when larry told me
one of mamma s chores had always been
to massage his you know what 
did larry expose himself to you 
all through the show 
did larry have an erection 
that s putting it mildly 
did he ask you to
perform oral sex for him 
at first  i mean  he just had me hold on
to his you know what
during whatever happened to be on tv 
he didn t get around to the
other thing you just mentioned
for a while 
i guess he figured if he went
all slow i wouldn t freak out
and get him in trouble 
but back then i didn t know that stuff
we was doing was criminal 
vanessa  victims often blame themselves 
it s a common occurrence 
make no mistake about it 
you are the victim 
really  bob 
absolutely 
i was such a baby back
then i didn t even know
why men wanted all that stuff done to them
in the first place 
vanessa  my god  you were a child 
you must have been so confused 
and when he did that
thing that you mentioned
for the first time  i swear to
christ i thought he was going
to the bathroom in my mouth 
vanessa  do i have your absolute trust 
i guess i trust you more
than i ve ever trusted anyone
in my whole life  bob 
and i really mean that 
thank you 
the reason why i m asking
is this very powerful new
psychological technique
that i d like to try on you 
i think it could really help you 
what do you think 
would you like to give it a try 
yeah 
sure 
  okay 
it consists of a battery of
questions that are designed
to trigger certain elements
of your subconscious 
i ve got to warn you  vanessa 
this technique  it can be uncomfortable 
go for it  bob 
i mean  if you think
it s going to help me 
okay  okay 
let s get started 
are you ready 
mm hmm 
a few moments ago 
you were telling me that
you felt like larry had gone
to the bathroom in your mouth 
those were your exact words 
do you remember 
now at that exact moment
when larry ejaculated
in your mouth 
did you feel as though somehow
you were being transformed
into some kind of a human urinal 
what  are you fucking crazy 
vanessa  you just have to answer
with the first thing that
comes into your mind 
it s very very important 
i knew i was flesh and blood 
i understand that 
but you have to tell me
exactly how you felt 
vanessa  you have to learn how to express
your feelings out loud 
i felt just like you said 
say it out loud  vanessa 
i felt like i had been   
transformed into a human urinal 
what made you feel like this 
having larry ejaculate in my mouth 
that s very good  vanessa 
very good 
now tell me this  and this
is absolutely crucial 
are you ready 
mm hmm 
vanessa   
did larry try to fuck you up the ass 
oh god 
he tried  later on 
vanessa 
did you like it when larry
fucked you up the ass 
you piece of shit 
vanessa  i told you this
can get very uncomfortable 
pull over right now 
we re not finished  yet 
oh yes  we are 
we are definitely finished 
now you pull on over 
vanessa  you can
suffer irreparable damage
if you break it off like this 
i don t give a goddamn 
jesus christ 
  shit 
  bitch 
  fucking pervert 
  jesus christ 
where s the door handle 
you looking for this 
you just settle down 
i m going to kill you 
i m going to slit your
fucking throat right now 
is that what you want me to fucking do 
okay  okay 
i m stopping  okay 
now you get down there
on the floor and you get my
fucking car keys and you
put them in the ignition 
you wouldn t like it
if someone was doing that to you 
well  you re probably right  vanessa 
i doubt i would like it if
someone was doing this to me 
well  then stop it 
i will stop it
if you promise to behave 
i promise i ll behave 
are you that guy on the news 
i m sorry 
you the guy that s been
killing all them girls
on the freeway  bob 
why you killing all them girls  bob 
because i ve absolutely reached my
fucking limit with
people like you  vanessa 
what kind of people am i supposed to be 
alcoholics  drug addicts 
fathers who fuck their daughters 
the drug addicted motherfucking
whores with their bastards
fucking offspring 
hey  i ain t no trick baby 
vanessa  i call them garbage
people  and i assure you
you are one of them 
  i am not 
  look at you 
you re already a master at
the manipulation of men 
i didn t run nothing on you 
it s so intrinsic to your fucking nature
you are not even aware
of it when you do it 
stupid bitch 
so what  you think
it s okay to do all sorts
of bad stuff to me now 
well  that s an open ended
discussion  vanessa 
dealing with deep
philosophical ramifications 
something you could hardly grasp 
in fact  take it from me 
a professional  vanessa 
you re an absolute fucking moron 
maybe i ain t smart like
you  and maybe i haven t
finished school  but at least
i ain t a fucking hypocrite 
vanessa  please indulge me 
tell me why i am a hypocrite 
you act like you s all
on some sort of mission 
but all you want to do is just
get off in a sex type way 
are you going to do sex to me now 
vanessa  i promise you if
we get really  really intimate
you re going to be way
past being offended 
what 
are you going to fuck me when i m dead 
mister  i m a person 
i m a human being 
yeah  like that drug addict
fucking whore of a mother
of yours 
well  i sure wouldn t
want to meet your mom  bob 
what 
you can talk about my mom 
but i can t talk about yours 
we are not here to
talk about me  vanessa 
we are here to talk about you 
so  get your fucking pants down

okay  i think it s only fair
to let me get my two cents in 
you re absolutely right 
i m sorry 
please  go on 
when a guy hurts someone
who never hurt them 
it makes him a criminal
first and a sick guy second

place to being crooked

please 
help me 
call my wife  please 
  freeze  police 
  hey officer  what s up 
let s go 
sir  i did nothing wrong 
  shut up 
  i did nothing wrong 
we ve got a gun 
we ve got a gun 
big wow 
god  you know half the
goddamn world s got a gun 
and you re going to throw
me in the back of this 
enough 
give me a goddamn break 
what  you re not even going to
speak to me mister  oink man 
i bet you like 
  backing up 
mr  wolverton 
mr  wolverton 
mr  wolverton has learned that
he s going to have to undergo
a radical colectomy 
that s awful 
  yeah 
  oh  please no 
there s a couple of detectives here
from the sheriff s department
that need to speak with you 
mr  wolverton  mr  wolverton 
mr  wolverton  can you hear me 
i m garnett wallace  from
the sheriff s department 
i know you re in a lot of pain 
but can you take a moment 
i want to show you a photograph 
tell me if this is the
person that shot you 
is this the person that shot you 
yes 
are you sure this is
the person that shot you 
okay  you ll be all right 
mrs  wolverton  your husband gave
a positive identification 
what happens now 
well  you have to keep
in mind this is a juvenile
we re talking about 
  what 
are you telling me you re
just going to let her go free 
i didn t say we re
going to let her go free 
she can be incarcerated
up to the age of 25 
for that 
look at him 
10 years 
my husband is in there with
god knows how many bullets
in his head  and in his back 
she deliberately shot him
over and over and over again 
i want her held responsible 
mrs  wolverton  i assure you that
whoever did this isn t
just going to walk away 
what if he dies  huh 
if he dies  i think she should
be put in the electric chair 
  gas 
  what 
they use gas in california 
i think you know what i mean  detective 
i certainly hope that the
people that are responsible
for prosecuting this case can muster
just a little bit more
sensitivity to the rights
of the victims than you appear to have 
i didn t mean to sound uncaring 
i want that little
monster to pay for this 
for me  for my husband  for
the next person out there that
she ll end up hurting or killing
if god forbid she s allowed
back on the streets again 
vanessa lutz 
yes  sir 
my name is garnett wallace
and this is my partner mike breer 
we re with the la sheriff s department 
you re that guy on tv  aren t you 
mm hmm 
i m investigating the i 5 murders 
well y all can all just
take a big old fucking cruise
because i took full out
care of that piece of shit 
mr  wolverton is in critical
condition  but he isn t dead 
oh yeah  right 
i shot him so many times 
aren t you concerned about being tried
as an adult for murder 
vanessa  the reason
we re here is to give you
an opportunity to change your story 
well  that would make me a
big fat liar  now wouldn t it 
look kid 
cooperate  because right now
we re the best friends you ve got 
yeah  i m so sure 
you don t believe we re your friends 
i believe you re out to ruin me 
look  i never said i wouldn t talk 
i might not happen to say
what y all want to hear 
so  you want me to talk  that s fine 
but you ve got to let me call
my fiancé right afterwards 
okay 
okay 
  you can 
fine 
no problem 
now talk 
what do you want to know 
did mr  wolverton say
he was the i 5 killer 
he didn t say he wasn t 
i haven t said that i m the i 5 killer 
and you haven t said
that you re going to slash
me dead with a razor and do
sex to my dead body  neither 
mr  wolverton
said that to you 
yeah 
right after he cut off all my hair 
then he called me one
of them garbage people 
then i asked him if he was that i 5 killer
and he just started
smiling all proud like 
you have an opportunity
now to clear your conscience 
i told the truth  and truth is eternal 
vanessa lutz 
you still haven t told us why you were
walking around with a loaded
pistol in the first place 
i was going to sell
it to finance my trip 
oh  yet you ended up
shooting some poor slob
who had the decency to
give you a ride instead 
yeah  except for the decency part 
when did you decide to rob him 
was it before or after you shot him 
look  that perv owed me
for pain and suffering 
so  yeah i took his money 
why didn t you just turn him in 
i wanted to  but he kept saying that
it would be his word
against mine and that he d
just get off and i would
go to foster care again 
and aside from that  i just
knew that if i let him go 
he would go out and kill some other girl 
and that would have been my fault 
and i couldn t have lived with that 
never 
no way 
why were you so convinced
we wouldn t believe you 
because i ve been in the system 
and once you ve been in the system once 
ain t no one never going
to believe you again 
it s just how it goes 
tell us about your past legal problems 
it s all in my file 
i want to hear it from you 
okay 
all right  when i was
younger  i used to have this
problem with shoplifting 
and i got caught 
and the judge sent me to
this group therapy session
for all these little girls
who was supposed to be clepto 
how many times were you
arrested for shoplifting vanessa 
seven times 
what else 
okay 
now this is going to sound bad 
but it s not as bad as it seems  okay 
but i learned later that i
had this problem with anger 
but i don t have that problem no more 
just answer the question 
back in texas  these cops
said i lit this shed on fire 
what 
you were arrested for arson 
yeah  but nobody got hurt 
it was no big deal 
and the judge even said
that i could get it
 explunged  from my record
if i was to go to these
group therapy sessions
with all them teenagers
who were supposed to be
firebugs or something 
but  um  that judge got switched 
so  that s why it s still there 
how many times
were you arrested for arson 
three times 
okay 
what else 
come on vanessa  tell us 
soliciting 
just doing what came natural  huh 
hey mike 
what s that supposed to mean 
let s get
back to the questions 
no  uh uh 
what s that supposed to mean 
what  you think prostitution comes natural
like being a nigger 
oh  wait you don t like
being called a nigger 
well  i don t like being
called a natural born whore 
so there 
  sit down 
  no 
he s talking to me the
way that fucking guy did 
is that why you shot him 
or was it because you wanted
what was in his wallet 
i already told you why i shot him 
you shit skinned motherfucker 
come on you fucking coon 
i ll kick your black ass all
over this fucking station 
shithead 
you okay  mike 
why did you call him those names  vanessa 
because he didn t say he was sorry 
and i knew it would piss him off 
now  how about that phone call 
come on  come on

hi 
vanessa 
  grandma 
vanessa 
vanessa 
vanessa julia lutz 
inmate shows no remorse for her crimes 
inmate is combative 
refuses to accept
responsibility for her actions 
recommendations 
this inmate appears to be
a sophisticated criminal 
and an extreme danger
to society  and should be
required to pay the penalty
for her actions in a
facility for adult criminals 
diagnosis 
antisocial personality disorder 
prognosis 
very poor 
recommendations 
this individual
is probably too far gone
to benefit from corrective
behavior modification
of the kind offered in
a setting for juveniles 
hello  vanessa 
do you think you can
join the rest of us now 
if nobody gives me no more problems 
we need to put an end to the system
that lets dangerous violent thugs
be prosecuted as juveniles
rather than as adults
even when they have committed
the most vicious crimes 
hi  this is janice
miller  of  inside view  
we re here with mr  robert
wolverton and his wife
mimi wolverton  at their
home in orange county 
would you describe some
of the hardships you ve had to endure
since this ordeal began 
my husband has been
permanently disfigured 
how can he ever work with children again 
his appearance  well  it frightens them 
he s unable to have sexual relations 
you re saying your
husband is no longer capable
of achieving an erection 
that part of our lives is over now 
what makes me so angry
is how that little monster ridiculed us
during her preliminary hearing 
and the media  how dare
the media talk about
how horrible her life is 
what about us 
that psychopath 
she s been locked up nine  10 times 
why was she ever let back
out on the streets again
in the first place 
if the teenager who allegedly shot
your husband were here 
what would you want to say to her 
was it worth the  300
she stole from my husband 
are you bitter  mr  wolverton 
well just  all the wonderful letters
that we received from across the country 
my dick may not function  but i have not
lost my smile 
i m not a bitter man 
i know there s a lot of people
looking for some real life heroes 
and i think i ve found a few 
their courage is a real inspiration 
and now stay tuned for an
unusual story about a couple of
sweltering polar bears in texas 
holy shit 
it s okay 
let me go get you some party punch 
no  i aint thirsty 
you re all wigged out  huh 
just get all these bad nightmares once
i get out of isolation 
i m so happy to get out
i can t even sleep at all 
let alone have nightmares 
for me it s like i get all shrunk down 
i don t get what you mean 
it s like i get like a
cat or a dog or something 
until i m just like they all are 
i get in the hole much
longer i m just going
to be like this hermit 
shunning all human contact 
scared like 
it s like that song says  vanessa 
people need people 
i ain t so sure about that  rhonda 
well  what is it that
you think that you need 
i ll tell you 
back in the hole  i decided
all i need to live is my will 
and a knife is good too 
so you don t feel so
at the mercy of events 
you made this 
yeah  my stepfather larry showed me how 
pretty cool  huh 
what are you going to do with it 
get the hell out of here 
you might have to mess
up some of the staff 
what  you really feel
sorry for them people 
you think normal people just
wake up one morning and decide
they re going to work in a prison 
they re perverts  every last one of them 
any of them fuckos get in my
way i m going to make them wish
they hadn t 
do you like that 
i ll make out with you  but no fucking 
because i m straight 
okay  you two 
your honor  it s obvious
my client is a child
and very unstable 
it says right here 
 nearly illiterate  emotionally immature 
prone to impulsivity  unpredictable  
your honor  she is charged
with a gruesome crime 
  counselor  please 
it goes on to say she
should be tried as an adult 
and stand trial
as an adult she will 
  thank you  your honor
