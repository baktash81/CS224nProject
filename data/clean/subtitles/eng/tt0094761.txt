    cherry coolers 
 i think i ve had enough 
nonsense  you ve never had enough 
my very own blend

you think this is a joke 
turn him loose 
we got eyewitnesses
placing him at the crime scene

colonel  has the deputy been briefed
in detail 
yes  sir 
i m heading to town now to get started 
splendid 
colonel hargis will arrange an escort 
what is going on over there 
that s the source of our worries 
a troublesome souvenir from space 
 what 
 a meteorite 
don t get too close 
there s danger of contamination 
i don t understand 
let me tell you a story 
the dinosaurs ruled our planet
for millions of years   
   and yet they died out almost overnight 
why 
the evidence suggests   
   that a meteor fell to earth bearing
an alien bacteria 
plague  is that what this is all about 
prevention 
and you think this meteor brought
some kind of a killer germ 
it s something i ve expected
and prepared for  all my life 
your meteor brought something all right 
but if it s a germ   
   it s the biggest son of a bitch
you ve ever seen 
what s the matter 
isn t it awfully late
to be trimming the hedges 
maybe this guy s a peeping tom
or something 
so  let s give him something to peep at 
wait a minute 
hockey season ended months ago 
he s going to get the camp counsellor
with the hedge trimmer 
but the girl gets away 
she s going to run into the lodge and hide 
but he s going to get her anyway 
please be quiet

   and checked every living soul
for signs of infection 
 ln the meantime  we re your prisoners

 alpha team  do you copy 
 affirmative 
status report 
highway 31 closed 
phone lines down 
we ve got this town locked up tight 
on up 
we suspected that conditions in space
would have a mutating effect on bacteria   
   but this 
its activity threw the satellite out of orbit 
correct  our little experimental virus
seems to have grown up   
   into a plasmic life form
that hunts its prey 
a predator  it s fantastic 
sir  the organism is growing
at a geometric rate 
by all accounts  it s at least
a thousand times its original mass 
this will put u s  defence years ahead
of the russians 
you don t understand 
at this rate  by next week 
there may be no u s 
nonsense 
all we have to do is contain it 
as far as the locals are concerned   
   this is simply a medical quarantine 
nobody gets in  or out 
dr  meddows  just for the record   
   i don t agree with any of this 
those people s lives are at stake 
don t you think i know that 
this isn t one of your textbook exercises 
mr  jennings 
this is an experiment in biological warfare 
or hadn t you noticed 
that organism could be the greatest
breakthrough in weapons research   
   since man split the atom 
what we do here will affect the balance
of world power 
of course there are lives at stake 
whole nations  in fact 
and that s far more important than
a handful of people in this small town 
and that is my cross to bear   
   mr  jennings 
now  carry out your orders 
yes  sir 
colonel 
colonel  we ve got a sighting 
hargis here 
an eyewitness saw the organism
pursue civilians   
    into the sewers 
 lt s got kevin  eddie and meg down there 
you ve got to do something 
excellent 
we need a schematic of the sewers 
we ll contain it down there 
i want that organism alive 
what about the civilians 
they re expendable 
get up 
stop him 
attention 
we have an infected civilian
trying to escape 
stop him before he reaches
a populated area 
halt  or we ll open fire 
i repeat  halt  or we ll open fire 
turn 
handicapped persons 
or persons in need of special assistance   
   may report to the blue station 
located on the north lawn 
dr  sims and dr  divatni 
please report to med  unit 1 
 are these the schematics 
 yes  sir 
the whole town s sitting
on a system of aqueducts   
   run off from the mountains 
can the organism be contained 
there seem to be three main junctions 
here  here  and here 
if we close off those valves 
i think we got it 
is it still after us 
i don t think so 
i ll be good  i swear 
i ll never see a movie  ever again 
it s going to be okay 
let s just find a way out of here 
this way

i think you pissed it off 
go 
my god   
    the day has come 
 reverend  come on 
you don t understand 
this has all been prophesied 
move  get out  everybody 
everybody  back 
he ran for it  meg  let s go  move 
come on 
reverend 
meg  look out 
it s the cold  it can t stand the cold 
hurry 
barricade all the entrances 
get some more co2 over here 
look out  coming through 
it s empty  meg  get back 
stay here 
and the great voice spoke
to the seven angels and said   go your    
there  right there 
it s out 
find some more 
help me 
come on  you can do better than that 
come on  you son of a bitch 
what a rush 
hey  man   
   i told you we d get snow 
you got to have faith 
i wonder if i m covered
for this sort of thing 
dave  bring in the dump truck 
we better get this thing
to the icehouse before dawn 
the will of god is written in the sky
in fingers of flame 
wormwood falls from heaven   
   consuming sinner and saint alike 
who shall be lifted up to rapture   
   when the judgement trumpet blows 
none but the faithful   
   brothers and sisters 
none but the faithful
