colonel hargis will arrange an escort
what is going on over there
thats the source of our worries
a troublesome souvenir from space
what
a meteorite
dont get too close
theres danger of contamination
i dont understand
let me tell you a story
the dinosaurs ruled our planet
for millions of years
and yet they died out almost overnight
why
the evidence suggests
that a meteor fell to earth bearing
an alien bacteria
plague is that what this is all about
prevention
and you think this meteor brought
some kind of a killer germ
its something ive expected
and prepared for all my life
your meteor brought something all right
but if its a germ
its the biggest son of a bitch
youve ever seen
whats the matter
isnt it awfully late
to be trimming the hedges
maybe this guys a peeping tom
or something
so lets give him something to peep at
wait a minute
hockey season ended months ago
hes going to get the camp counsellor
with the hedge trimmer
but the girl gets away
shes going to run into the lodge and hide
but hes going to get her anyway

affirmative
status report
highway 31 closed
phone lines down
weve got this town locked up tight
on up
we suspected that conditions in space
would have a mutating effect on bacteria
but this
its activity threw the satellite out of orbit
correct our little experimental virus
seems to have grown up
into a plasmic life form
that hunts its prey
a predator its fantastic
sir the organism is growing
at a geometric rate
by all accounts its at least
a thousand times its original mass
this will put us defence years ahead
of the russians
you dont understand
at this rate by next week
there may be no us
nonsense
all we have to do is contain it
as far as the locals are concerned
this is simply a medical quarantine
nobody gets in or out
dr meddows just for the record
i dont agree with any of this
those peoples lives are at stake
dont you think i know that
this isnt one of your textbook exercises
mr jennings
this is an experiment in biological warfare
or hadnt you noticed
that organism could be the greatest
breakthrough in weapons research
since man split the atom
what we do here will affect the balance
of world power
of course there are lives at stake
whole nations in fact
and thats far more important than
a handful of people in this small town
and that is my cross to bear
mr jennings
now carry out your orders
yes sir
colonel
colonel weve got a sighting
hargis here
an eyewitness saw the organism
pursue civilians
into the sewers
lts got kevin eddie and meg down there
youve got to do something
excellent
we need a schematic of the sewers
well contain it down there
i want that organism alive
what about the civilians
theyre expendable
get up

trying to escape
stop him before he reaches
a populated area
halt or well open fire
i repeat halt or well open fire
