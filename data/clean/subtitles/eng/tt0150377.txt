a few members of my valuable staff
our dedicated teacher and head
of admissions miss angela green

the weekend if you like it its yours
if i like it
we cant afford it
have i ever let that get in my way
what about matty
ill take care of him itll be great
you hate to sail

i dont think we should wait
i dont see land
so where is it
alaskas that way japan is straight
ahead and australia is off to the left
where would you like to go

nick
nick
oh my god
nick
nick
nick
nick
oh my god
oh my god nick
this is the coastguard
put the knife down and step away
i i dont know
i dont know where my husband is
hey tom
what have you got for me
anything
no
cutter please dont let them
give up hes a very strong man
the raft and life preservers
are all on board
these guys tracked the wind
the currents
theres nothing
the water temperature overnight
was 51 degrees
thats really cold
i cant breathe
just put your head down
deep breaths big breaths
mommy look
hey kiddo
hey bobby
hey libby
cutter asked me to come by
and talk to you
not as an attorney just as a friend
the inquest was held this morning
nicks officially been declared dead
libby they determined it was
a wrongful death and you
jesus youre being
formally charged with his murder
im here to advise you make no
statements whatsoever to the sheriff
im sorry libby
cutter
not in front of my kid okay
im sorry libby
the judge denied us bail
can angie keep looking after matty
good
okay
lets take a look at this
see what we can do
bobby heres what i think happened
i had some wine and i fell asleep
it must have been the sun
maybe nick was trying to cut
a snagged line because
the knife from the galley
was on deck
and maybe the boat pitched
and he cut himself
and he tried to come below
to wake me up
i quit these when i met nick
itll be all right i promise you
why dont we take a look
at this first guarantee life
you both bought insurance policies
from the company four months ago
and you are the beneficiary
im his wife
you know its worth two million
he wanted everything to be okay
im afraid the jury may see
the two million as a motive
is that what theyre saying out there
no one is saying
that i killed nick for money
i know we had problems
and nick worried but we were okay
two of his investors
were suing him for embezzlement
first seattle issued a lien on
all his properties your possessions
nicks death erases these problems
leaving you with two million dollars
do you think i killed him
what lawyers think doesnt matter
it matters to me
no of course
i dont think you killed him
what was the condition of the radio
when you had a chance to inspect it
the handset cord had been cut
and as you approached the boat
what did you see
mrs parsons was holding a knife
i show you states exhibit
number four
mayday mayday
this is morning star
state your emergency
ive been stabbed
im bleeding jesus
my name is nicholas parsons
state your position
i dont know
three miles northwest of
whidbey island i guess
oh god
mrs parsons
youve heard the testimony
and your explanation is that someone
must have boarded the boat
thats right
well lets consider
all the possibilities
maybe a band of pirates or aliens
did aliens murder your husband
no aliens werent beneficiaries in
your husbands life insurance
objection the prosecutor
overruled
i told you what happened
you told us that you were asleep
maybe you were sleepwalking
when you stabbed him to death
this isnt a closing argument
withdrawn
i didnt kill my husband
i loved my husband
i did not kill my husband
you have to believe me
im sorry libby
its not your fault bobby
i want to ask you something angie
id like you to adopt my son
i cant do that not to you
ive thought it through
i barely survived my parents house
im not going to put him there
moneys no problem the two million
is going into a trust fund in his name
it isnt about money
i know
matty loves you
we cant let him become
a ward of the state
thank you
hey kiddo come see me
youre going to stay with angie
for a while
and youre going to have lots of fun
i know youre going to be a good boy
yes mommy
as soon as all this is over
well be together again
thats a promise kiddo
i love you
i love you too
whos this

what do you think a year
five cartons says she offs herself
inside of six months
get away from me
take it easy were your friends

i know what a pain it is to get here
i taught him how to say the abcs

a b c d e f g
h i j k l m n o p

youre trying to reach your friend
the one with your boy
yeah i cant find him
he disappeared
if you could disappear that easy
i wouldnt be here now

think use your head
theres got to be a way
to track him down
small frye school front office
hello this is angela green
angie its jennifer
its nice to hear your voice
i havent got a severance cheque
in a while
do you have my correct address
and phone number
ill check can you hold on a sec
yes of course thank you
yeah i have it right here
tell me if this is right
3321 mason street
san francisco 94105
the phone number is 415
hello
angie
libby ive tried to call you
is matty okay where is he
everything is fine
why are you in san francisco
put him on the phone
why are you acting this way
you disappeared
i havent seen my son in a month
i was just about to call you
bullshit
how can you move and not tell me
we were coming next week
just put matty on the phone
matty its mommy come say hi
hi mommy
hello sweetiepie
how are you matty
i think about you all the time i miss
you so much are you doing okay
i love you
i know this has been really hard
but angies going to bring you
up to see me next week
yes mommy
daddy
nick
he was in san francisco last night
the number is already disconnected
no i dont have
a forwarding address hes gone
dont you have investigators doesnt
your company want its two million
why arent you listening to me
i am innocent
put some elbow grease into it
no one wants burnt tapioca
does it smell like its burning
you got shit for brains girl
youre in prison
do you get that
so you can forget about reopening
your case or a jailhouse appeal
they take years
and theyre 95 unsuccessful
so if you want my advice and youre
gonna get it you do your time
what are you now a lawyer
once upon a time
but they tend to disbar murderers
heres your christmas present
pay attention this is the best advice
youre ever gonna get
you ever hear of something called
double jeopardy
it provides that no person may be
tried for the same crime twice
they say you killed your husband
they cant convict you a second time
when you leave track him down
when you find him you can kill him
you can walk right up to him put
a gun to his head and pull the trigger
and theres nothing
anybody can do about it
makes you feel
warm and tingly all over dont it
thats right keep stirring
i got to hand it to you honey
its sheer hate driving you on
the only way youll look like that
is if i staple the picture to your head
mattys eighth birthday honey
i read that even if a child is
separated from its mother at birth
it never forgets her voice
you think thats true
of course i do
ive grown these past six years
they dont want you to be a tree
repeat after me if i could trade
places with my husband i would
and throw in
that bornagain jesus stuff
start with this im not sitting
in front of you to make excuses
im not sitting in front of you today
to try and make any excuses
i killed my husband
ive lived with that for six years
but im a changed person
why should we believe you
i cant ask you to believe me
all i can do is believe in myself
i know that if im given a chance
i can do something good with my life
make up for the wrong i did
mommy talk to me
man did you see that
if the people who did that
showed up here
the mans across the hall
