having a better time than anyone else 
but now is the time you ante up  for
drinking my liquor  eating my food 
spilling tomato sauce on my couch   
bobby long 
you didn t think i saw you 
  he is insufferable 
  the small frye school needs cash 
so while you re reaching
for your cheque books   
i m pleased to introduce rebecca
tingley  our ravishing headmistress 
mr  parsons  thank you 
i d like to start by introducing
a few members of my valuable staff 
our dedicated teacher  and head
of admissions  miss angela green 
what are you thinking about 
  was i always as rude as i am now 
  absolutely 
hi 
come have a seat

  it s best she hears it from us 
  she s not going to be happy about it 
  what s up  guys 
close your eyes  close them 
stand up 
  libby  what is your favorite thing 
  me 
not even close 
all right  open 
i made sean an offer 
he agreed to let us take it out for
the weekend  if you like it  it s yours 
if i like it 
  we can t afford it 
  have i ever let that get in my way 
  what about matty 
  i ll take care of him  it ll be great 
  you hate to sail 
  i can learn 
generally  a wine like this
needs time to breathe 
i don t think we should    wait 
i don t see land 
so where is it 
alaska s that way  japan is straight
ahead  and australia is off to the left 
  where would you like to go 
  bed 
that can be arranged 
  we should do this more often 
  what  buy expensive sailboats 
if this is what happens 
i ll buy you another one tomorrow 
no  go away  just the two of us 
with nobody else around 
i ll drink to that 
nick 
nick 
oh  my god   
nick 
nick 
nick 
nick  
oh  my god 
oh  my god  nick 
this is the coastguard 
put the knife down and step away 
i    i don t know   
i don t know where my husband is 
hey  tom 
what have you got for me 
  anything 
  no 
cutter  please don t let them
give up  he s a very strong man 
the raft and life preservers
are all on board 
these guys tracked the wind 
the currents   
there s nothing 
the water temperature overnight
was 51 degrees 
that s really cold 
  i can t breathe 
  just put your head down 
deep breaths  big breaths 
mommy  look 
hey  kiddo 
hey  bobby 
hey  libby 
cutter asked me to come by
and talk to you 
not as an attorney  just as a friend 
the inquest was held this morning 
nick s officially been declared dead 
libby  they determined it was
a wrongful death  and you   
jesus    you re being
formally charged with his murder 
i m here to advise you  make no
statements whatsoever to the sheriff 
i m sorry  libby 
cutter 
not in front of my kid  okay 
i m sorry  libby 
the judge denied us bail 
can angie keep looking after matty 
good 
okay   
let s take a look at this 
see what we can do 
bobby  here s what i think happened 
i had some wine  and i fell asleep 
it must have been the sun 
maybe nick was trying to cut
a snagged line  because     
  the knife from the galley
was on deck 
and maybe the boat pitched 
and he cut himself 
and he tried to come below
to wake me up 
i quit these when i met nick 
it ll be all right  i promise you 
why don t we take a look
at this first guarantee life 
you both bought insurance policies
from the company four months ago 
  and you are the beneficiary 
  i m his wife 
  you know it s worth two million 
  he wanted everything to be okay 
i m afraid the jury may see
the two million as a motive 
  is that what they re saying out there 
  no one is saying   
that i killed nick for money 
i know we had problems 
and nick worried  but we were okay 
two of his investors
were suing him for embezzlement 
first seattle issued a lien on
all his properties  your possessions   
nick s death erases these problems 
leaving you with two million dollars 
  do you think i killed him 
  what lawyers think doesn t matter 
it matters to me 
no  of course 
i don t think you killed him 
what was the condition of the radio
when you had a chance to inspect it 
  the handset cord had been cut 
  and as you approached the boat   
  what did you see 
  mrs  parsons was holding a knife 
i show you state s exhibit
number four 
mayday  mayday 
this is  morning star  
  state your emergency 
  i ve been stabbed 
i m bleeding  jesus   
my name is nicholas parsons 
  state your position 
  i don t know 
three miles northwest of
whidbey island  i guess 
oh  god 
mrs  parsons 
you ve heard the testimony 
and your explanation is that someone
must have boarded the boat 
that s right 
well  let s consider
all the possibilities 
maybe a band of pirates  or aliens 
did aliens murder your husband 
no  aliens weren t beneficiaries in
your husband s life insurance 
  objection  the prosecutor   
  overruled 
  i told you what happened 
  you told us that you were asleep 
maybe you were sleepwalking
when you stabbed him to death 
  this isn t a closing argument 
  withdrawn 
i didn t kill my husband 
i loved my husband 
i did not kill my husband 
you have to believe me 
i m sorry  libby 
it s not your fault  bobby 
i want to ask you something  angie 
i d like you to adopt my son 
  i can t do that  not to you 
  i ve thought it through 
i barely survived my parents  house 
i m not going to put him there 
money s no problem  the two million
is going into a trust fund in his name 
  it isn t about money 
  i know 
matty loves you 
we can t let him become
a ward of the state 
thank you 
hey kiddo  come see me 
you re going to stay with angie
for a while 
and you re going to have lots of fun 
i know you re going to be a good boy 
yes  mommy 
as soon as all this is over   
  we ll be together again 
that s a promise  kiddo 
i love you 
i love you too 
  who s this 
  rich bitch from whidbey island 
  she ain t gonna make it 
  what do you think  a year 
five cartons says she offs herself
inside of six months 
  get away from me 
  take it easy  we re your friends 
heard you did your husband 
he probably deserved it 
mine did 
  i know what a pain it is to get here 
  i taught him how to say the abc s

can you tell me 
a  b  c  d  e  f  g

make friends  buy another pack fast 
 cause your personality

you re trying to reach your friend 
the one with your boy 
yeah  i can t find him 
he disappeared 
if you could disappear that easy 
i wouldn t be here now

think  use your head 
there s got to be a way
to track him down 
  small frye school  front office 
  hello  this is angela green 
  angie  it s jennifer 
  it s nice to hear your voice 
i haven t got a severance cheque
in a while 
do you have my correct address
and phone number 
  i ll check  can you hold on a sec 
  yes  of course  thank you 
yeah  i have it right here 
tell me if this is right 
3321 mason street 
san francisco 94105 
the phone number is 415   
  hello 
  angie 
  libby  i ve tried to call you 
  is matty okay  where is he 
  everything is fine 
  why are you in san francisco 
  put him on the phone 
  why are you acting this way 
you disappeared 
i haven t seen my son in a month 
  i was just about to call you 
  bullshit 
  how can you move and not tell me 
  we were coming next week 
just put matty on the phone 
matty  it s mommy  come say hi 
  hi  mommy 
  hello  sweetie pie 
how are you  matty 
i think about you all the time  i miss
you so much  are you doing okay 
i love you 
i know this has been really hard   
  but angie s going to bring you
up to see me next week 
yes  mommy   
daddy 
nick 
he was in san francisco last night 
the number is already disconnected 
no  i don t have
a forwarding address  he s gone 
don t you have investigators  doesn t
your company want its two million 
why aren t you listening to me 
i am innocent 
put some elbow grease into it 
no one wants burnt tapioca 
  does it smell like it s burning 
  you got shit for brains  girl 
you re in prison 
do you get that 
so you can forget about re opening
your case  or a jailhouse appeal 
they take years 
and they re 95  unsuccessful 
so if you want my advice  and you re
gonna get it  you do your time 
what are you now  a lawyer 
once upon a time 
but they tend to disbar murderers 
here s your christmas present   
pay attention  this is the best advice
you re ever gonna get 
you ever hear of something called
double jeopardy 
it provides that no person may be
tried for the same crime twice 
they say you killed your husband 
they can t convict you a second time 
when you leave  track him down 
when you find him  you can kill him 
you can walk right up to him  put
a gun to his head and pull the trigger 
and there s nothing
anybody can do about it 
makes you feel
warm and tingly all over  don t it 
that s right  keep stirring 
i got to hand it to you  honey 
it s sheer hate driving you on 
the only way you ll look like that
is if i staple the picture to your head 
matty s eighth birthday  honey 
i read that even if a child is
separated from its mother at birth   
  it never forgets her voice 
you think that s true 
of course i do 
   i ve grown these past six years  
  they don t want you to be a tree 
repeat after me   if i could trade
places with my husband  i would  
and throw in
that born again jesus stuff 
start with this   i m not sitting
in front of you to make excuses    
i m not sitting in front of you today
to try and make any excuses 
i killed my husband 
i ve lived with that for six years 
but i m a changed person 
why should we believe you 
i can t ask you to believe me 
all i can do is believe in myself 
i know that  if i m given a chance 
i can do something good with my life 
make up for the wrong i did 
mommy  talk to me 
man  did you see that 
   if the people who did that
showed up here   
  the man s across the hall
