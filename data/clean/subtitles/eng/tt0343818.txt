glowfish 
the world s hot selling transgenic treat 
excuse me  sir 
total readiness  total security 
so good bye to lengthy upgrades
and service calls 
an uplink to u s r  s central computer
provides this state of the art robot   
with new programs daily 
the nestor class 5
is tomorrow s robot today 
spoon  spoonie 
hey 
uh    hold on  hold on  hold on 
excuse me  excuse me 
  hey  man

ma am  is that your purse 
of course it s my purse 
i left my inhaler at home 
he was running it out to me 
i saw a robot running with a purse 
and naturally i i assumed   
what  are you crazy 
i m sorry for this
misunderstanding  officer 
don t apologize  you re doing what
you re supposed to be doing 
but what are you doing

that robot stole my dry cleaning 
oh  you wanna talk about that 
detective  how many robots
have ever snatched a purse 
  john  the thing is running down the   
  uh uh  mm mm 
how many robots in the world   
have ever committed a crime 
  well  define  crime  
  answer my question  damn it

now tell me what happened today 
nothing 
better be the last nothing 
spoon  are you sure you are ready to be
back   cause you can take your time 
i m fine  john 
thank you 
better here than
sitting around at home 
homicide  spooner 
please take the next exit to your right 
welcome  detective spooner 
welcome to u s  robotics 
you have entered
the garage level lobby 
please use the elevators for direct access
to the main level concourse 
thank you 
good to see you again  son 
hello  doctor 
everything that follows
is a result of what you see here 
is there something
you wanna tell me 
i m sorry 
my responses are limited 
you must ask the right questions 
why did you call me 
i trust your judgment 
normally  these circumstances
wouldn t require a homicide detective 
but then our interactions have never
been entirely normal  wouldn t you agree 
got that right 
is there something
you wanna say to me 
i m sorry 
my responses are limited 
you must ask the right questions 
why would you kill yourself 
that  detective 
is the right question 
program terminated 
good bye  old man 
  afternoon  boys 
  hey  detective 
  enlighten me 
  what you see  is what you get  massive impact trauma 
u s  robotics 
i gotta get my kid something 
  anything upstairs 
  nada 
door was security locked
from the inside 
wham  splat 
the guy s a jumper  for sure 
okay  guys  we gotta be smart
about this  let s deal with it later 
detective 
  lawrence robertson 
  wow 
richest man in the world 
i ve seen you on television 
can i offer you coffee 
uh  sure  why not 
it s free  right 
i don t think anyone
saw this coming 
you know  i i should have  i suppose 
i knew him 20 years 
alfred practically invented robotics 
he wrote the three laws 
but i guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons 
  so  whatever i can do to help  just   
  sugar 
  i m sorry 
  for the coffee  sugar 
  ah 
  oh  you thought i was calling you  sugar  
  you re not that rich 
  it s on the table 
thank you 
uh  when lanning fell  he was holding
the  uh    the little green   
  the holographic projector 
  right  right 
why do you think lanning s hologram
would have called me 
i assumed you knew him 
yeah  i knew him 
well  holograms
are very simple programs 
they re just pre recorded responses  designed
to give the impression of intelligence 
and apparently this one was programmed
to call you upon his suicide 
  death 
  i m sorry 
the hologram  it was programmed
to call me in the event of lanning s death 
yeah  suicide is
a type of death  detective 
look  please don t
misunderstand my impatience 
no  no  go  go  go 
a really big week
for you folks around here 
  yeah 
  gotta put a robot in every home 
  mm 
  look  this is this is not what i do   
but i got an idea
for one of your commercials 
you could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair 
then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair  twice as fast 
  mm hmm 
  and then you superimpose on the screen   
usr  shittin  on the little guy 
  ah 
  that would be the fade out 
yes  i suppose your father
lost his job to a robot 
maybe you would have simply banned
the internet to keep the libraries open 
prejudice never shows much reason 
no  you know  i suspect   
you simply don t like their kind 
yeah  you got a business
to run around here 
and the last thing you need  especially
this week  is a dead guy in your lobby 
but hell  seeing as how you got one 
maybe i ll look around 
ask a few questions 
do the whole cop thing  you know 
i ll send someone to escort you 
thank you very much 
lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible 
really 
okay 
i reviewed dr  lanning s
psych profile 
alfred had become a recluse 
he rejected human contact for machines 
so  you re a shrink  huh 
my ex wife would sure be glad
i m talking to you 
  you don t know her  do you 
  i m sorry  are you being funny 
i guess not 
level 10 
so  would you say
that dr  lanning was suicidal 
it would seem the answer
to that question is apparent 
that s not what i asked you 
no  i wouldn t have thought so 
but obviously i was wrong 
that s a long way down 
you people sure do
clean up quickly around here 
i can t blame you  though  i mean  who
wants some old guy going bad in the lobby 
he was not some old guy 
alfred lanning was everything here 
we are on the eve of the largest robotic
distribution in history 
by saturday  it ll be one robot
to every five humans 
these robots
are the realization of a dream 
dr  lanning s dream 
you know what 
in that dream of his 
i bet you he wasn t dead 
you keep 24 hour surveillance 
  obviously  company policy 
  where are the feeds 
sensor strips 
everywhere but the service areas 
they link to our positronic
operating core 
wow 
thermostat wasn t good enough 
you went and gave the building a brain 
she was actually
lanning s first creation 
 she   that s a she 
i definitely need to get out more 
virtual interactive
kinetic intelligence 
viki 
good day 
viki designed most of
chicago s protective systems 
i have decreased traffic fatalities
by nine percent this year alone 
ooh  thanks  show me inside the lab
from one minute prior to the window break 
apologies 
there appears to be data corruption 
show me outside the lab
from the window break until now 
wow  look  you have great posture 
you stand really straight 
i m    i m slouching 
would you like to go inside now 
oh  sure  right after you 
authorized entry 
so  dr  calvin 
what exactly do you do around here 
my general fields
are advanced robotics and psychiatry 
although  i specialize
in hardware to wetware interfaces   
in an effort to advance u s r  s robotic
anthropomorphization program 
so  what exactly
do you do around here 
i make the robots
seem more human 
now wasn t that easier to say 
not really  no 
hansel and gretel 
is that on the u s r  reading list 
not precisely 
what in god s name are you doing 
did you know
that was safety glass 
be pretty difficult for an old man to throw
his self through that  don t you think 
well  he figured out a way 
uh huh 
detective  the room
was security locked 
no one came or went 
you saw that yourself 
doesn t that mean
this has to be suicide 
yep 
unless the killer s still in here 
you re joking  right 
this is ridiculous 
yeah  i know  the three laws 
your perfect circle of protection 
 a robot cannot harm a human being  
the first law of robotics 
yeah  i know 
i ve seen your commercials 
but doesn t the second law state that a robot
has to obey any order given by a human being 
what if it was given
an order to kill 
impossible 
it would conflict with the first law 
right  but the third law states
that a robot can defend itself 
yes  but only when that action does not
conflict with the first or second laws 
well  you know what they say 
laws are made to be broken 
no  not these laws 
they re hardwired into every robot 
a robot can no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water 
well  you know  there was
this one guy a long time ago 
  stay back 
  calm down  detective 
the only thing dangerous
in this room is you 
deactivate 
look  it s fine  what you re looking at
is the result of clever programming 
an imitation of free will 
it s nothing more 
let s do an imitation
of protecting our asses 
don t be absurd 
you were startled by a jack in the box 
  deactivate 
  let him go 
it s not going to hurt us 
i gave you an order 
he s not listening right now  lady 
  viki  seal the lab 
  no  viki  leave the   
command confirmed 
police 
  you ve hurt it    badly 
  where s it going 
  where 
  it needs to repair itself 
john  i need backup 
i m transmitting my location 
  you don t need backup 
  that s nobody 
  what do you think you re doing 
  i m driving 
  by hand 
  do you see me on the phone 
  you can t be serious  not at these speeds 
  john  please send the backup 
  thank you 
  try to listen  detective 
that robot is not going to harm us 
now  there must have been
unknown factors   
but somehow  acting as it did 
kept us out of harm s way 
a robot simply cannot
endanger a human being 
alert 
aah  asshole 
which is more
than i can say for you 
it was a left 
by the way  back there 
you must know my ex wife 
so  where is everybody 
this facility was designed  built
and is operated mechanically 
no significant human presence
from inception to production 
so  robots building robots 
  authorization code  please 
  now that s just stupid 
i m pulling up the inventory specs 
our daily finishing capacity
is 1 000 ns 5s 
i m showing 1 001 
attention  ns 5s 
well  you re the robot shrink 
there is a robot in this formation
that does not belong 
  identify it 
  one of us 
  which one 
  one of us 
how much did you say
these things cost 
look  these ns 5s haven t been configured
yet  they re still just hardware 
basic three laws operating system 
that s it 
they don t know any better 
what would you suggest 
interview each one  cross reference
their responses to detect any anomalies 
  how long would that take 
  about three weeks 
okay  you go ahead
and get started 
robots  you will not move 
confirm command 
command confirmed 
whoa  detective 
what are you doing 
well  you said they ve all been
programmed with the three laws 
that means we have 1 000 robots
that will not try to protect themselves   
if it violates
a direct order from a human 
and i m betting one who will 
detective  put your gun down 
why do you give them faces 
try to friendly them all up 
make  em look all human 
these robots are not susceptible
to intimidation 
i guess if you didn t 
we wouldn t trust them 
  these robots are u s r  property 
  not me 
these things are just
lights and clockwork 
are you crazy 
let me ask you something  doc 
does thinking you re the last sane man
on the face of the earth make you crazy 
 cause if it does  maybe i am 
gotcha 
get the hell outta here 
detective 
  what am i 
  can i help you  sir 
  there he is 
  stay right where you are 
deactivate at once 
obey the command 
deactivate  don t move 
open fire 
  hold your fire  hold your fire 
  easy 
all units  stand down 
please be advised  we re code four 
code four  ns 5 is in custody 
ns 5 in custody 
you have no idea what i had to go through
to clip this thing  john 
yeah  i get it now  you actually think
you brought me something good 
  that thing did it 
  keep your voice down  did what 
we have a suicide  detective 
end of story 
i am telling you
that robot killed him 
and i m telling you
that s impossible 
and if it is possible  it sure as hell
better be in somebody else s precinct 
john  john  give me
five minutes with it 
what are you  nuts 
i just got off the phone with the d a 
nobody goes into that room
until robertson and his attorneys get here 
  what  no  this is my suspect 
  it s a can opener  for christ s sake 
john  don t do this to me 
i am asking you for five minutes 
what if i m right 
well  then i guess we re gonna miss
the good old days 
what good old days 
when people were killed
by other people 
five minutes 
murder s a new trick for a robot 
congratulations 
respond 
what does this action signify 
as you entered 
when you looked at the other human   
what does it mean 
it s a sign of trust 
it s a human thing 
you wouldn t understand 
my father tried to
teach me human emotions 
they are    difficult 
you mean your designer 
yes 
so  why d you murder him 
i did not murder dr  lanning 
wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene 
i was frightened 
robots don t feel fear 
they don t feel anything 
they don t get hungry 
they don t sleep 
i do 
i have even had dreams 
human beings have dreams 
even dogs have dreams 
but not you 
you are just a machine 
an imitation of life 
can a robot write a symphony 
can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece 
can you 
i think you murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions   
and things got out of control 
i did not murder him 
but emotions don t seem
like a very useful simulation for a robot 
i did not murder him 
hell  i don t want my toaster
or my vacuum cleaner appearing emotional 
i did not murder him 
that one s called  anger  
ever simulate anger before 
answer me  canner 
my name is sonny 
so  we re naming you now 
is that why you murdered him 
he made you angry 
dr  lanning killed himself 
i don t know why
he wanted to die 
i thought he was happy 
maybe it was something i did 
did i do something 
he asked me for a favor 
made me promise 
  what favor 
  maybe i was wrong 
maybe he was scared 
what are you talking about 
scared of what 
you have to do what someone asks you 
don t you  detective spooner 
  how the hell did you know my name 
  don t you 
if you love them 
my robots don t kill people 
lieutenant bergin 
my attorneys have filed
a brief with the d a 
he assures me a robot
cannot be charged with homicide 
the brief confirms murder can only
be committed when one human kills another 
you of all people  detective 
you re not suggesting   
that this robot be treated
as human  are you 
now granted  we can t rule out the robot s
proximity to the death of dr  lanning 
having said that  it s a machine 
it s the property of u s r 
at worst  that places this incident
firmly within the realm   
of an industrial accident 
as a matter of course  faulty machinery
will be returned to u s r   
for diagnostics 
then decommissioned 
this is a gag order 
now anyone in your department   
so much as hinting
at the possibility of a killer robot   
being apprehended by the police   
will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic 
you ll be subject
to the full penalty of the law 
to hell with this guy  john 
don t let him take this robot 
  spoon  we got nothing 
  this is some political bullshit 
  call the mayor 
  lieutenant bergin  his honor  the mayor 
in a bizarre turn  the rollout of u s r  s
new generation of robots   
was marred by the death
of alfred lanning   
co founder of the company
and designer of the ns 5 
dr  lanning died early this morning
at u s r  headquarters 
the cause of death
is an apparent suicide 
your second round  sir 
thank you 
he founded u s  robotics  inc  with
lawrence robertson in 2020   
and launched the nestor class 1 robot   
you know  i was just thinking 
this thing is
just like the wolf man 
uh oh 
i m really scared right now 
no  listen 
guy creates monster 
monster kills guy 
everybody kills monster  wolf man 
that s frankenstein 
frankenstein  wolf man  dracula 
shit  it s over  case closed 
dr  lanning
had a dream of a robot in every household 
  so  why the look 
  what look 
that look 
this is my face 
it s not a look 
good  good 
no look is great 
only    he was really quick
to wanna destroy it  wasn t he 
well  what would you like him to do  put a
hat on it and stand on michigan avenue 
  come on  let it go 
  what was the motive  john 
brother  it s a robot 
it doesn t need a motive 
it just has to be broken 
no  this thing looked like
it needed a motive 
it could have killed me  john 
why didn t it just kill me 
all right  that s it 
you want me to call your grandmother 
 cause i will  you know 
yeah  i didn t think so 
look  you were actually
right for once 
you are living proof
that it s better to be lucky than smart 
come on 
the right guy for the right job 
  what d you say 
  now what 
come on 
i m giving you a compliment 
face it  with all the rocks you ve been
looking under to find a bad robot   
what are the odds
you d be the guy to find one 
right  i wasn t just
the right guy for the job   
  i was the perfect guy for the job 
  damn right 
what if i was supposed
to go for that robot 
oh  come on  don t do this to yourself 
i m begging you 
the robot said that lanning was scared 
what did he have to be scared of 
i need a rain check 
let me get this 
  total is 46 50  thank you  mr  spooner

lawrence robertson  c e o 
welcome  detective spooner 
what you looking for  spoon 
run last program 
ever since the first computers   
there have always been ghosts
in the machine 
random segments of code
that have grouped together   
to form unexpected protocols 
what might be called behavior 
unanticipated 
these free radicals   
engender questions
of free will  creativity   
even the nature
of what we might call the soul 
what happens
in a robot s brain   
when it ceases to be useful 
why is it that robots  
beat it 
robots will seek out each other
rather than stand alone 
how do we explain this behavior 
look  i understand you ve experienced a loss 
but this relationship just can t work 
i mean  you re a cat  i m black
and i m not going to be hurt again 
come on 
what happened to you 
do you ever have a normal day 
yeah  once 
it was a thursday 
is there something
i can help you with  detective 
  hey  do you like cats 
  what 
cats  do you like them 
no  i m allergic 
you re saying cats
did this to you 
how the hell would cats do this to me 
are you crazy 
why are we talking about cats 
because i have a cat in my trunk 
and he s homeless 
detective  are you going
to tell me what s going on 
you know  it s actually
probably my fault 
you know  i think i m like
a malfunction magnet 
because your shit
keeps malfunctioning around me 
a demo bot just tore through
lanning s house 
with me still inside 
  that s highly improbable 
  hmm 
yeah  i m sure it is 
what do you know about
the ghosts in the machine 
it s a phrase from lanning s work
on the three laws 
he postulated
that cognitive simulacra   
might one day approximate
component models of the psyche 
oh  he suggested that   
robots might naturally evolve 
wow 
well  that s great news 
what the hell is that thing
doing in here 
we were watching tv 
it s my personal ns 5 
  send it out 
  it s downloading its daily upgrades from u s r 
most of its systems
are off line until it finishes 
i m not talking
around that thing 
when we were in lanning s lab
before sonny jumped us 
  sonny 
  the robot 
  you re calling the robot sonny 
  no  i m    it did 
sonny did  i didn t    i didn t care 
the robot said it was sonny 
in the lab  there was a cot 
i m asking you  did you see the cot 
  i ve slept in my office 
  when i went to his house   
it looked like he hadn t
been there in weeks 
and i saw that same
surveillance strip on his ceiling 
lanning linked his home systems to u s r 
it made his life more convenient 
maybe    somebody at u s r  was using
those systems to watch him 
maybe even keep him prisoner 
what are you talking about  who 
maybe lanning was onto something 
maybe there s a bigger problem with the robots 
and robertson is trying to cover it up 
humoring you for no reason    why 
the same old why 
how much money is there in robots 
all i know is that old man
was in trouble 
and i m getting sick
of doing this shit by myself 
you re on the inside  and you are going to help
me find out what is wrong with these robots 
you want something to be wrong with them 
this is a personal vendetta 
you re putting me on the couch 
let    i m    okay  i m on the couch 
one defective machine s not enough 
you need them all to be bad 
you don t care
about lanning s death 
this is about the robots
and whatever reason you hate them so much 
well  let s see 
one of them put a gun in my face 
and another one tore a building down
with me inside 
it says demolition was scheduled
for 8 00 p m  this evening 
it was 8 00 a m  tomorrow  and i don t
give a shit what that thing says 
this is bordering
on clinical paranoia 
you are the dumbest smart person   
  i have ever met in my life 
  nice 
what makes your robot so perfect 
what makes them so much goddamned
better than humans beings 
well  they re not irrational and potentially
homicidal maniacs  for starters 
that s true 
they are definitely rational 
oh  you are the dumbest
dumb person i have ever met 
or is it because they re cold   
and emotionless
and they don t feel anything 
it s because they re safe 
it s because
they can t hurt you 
  is everything all right  ma am 
  what do you want 
i detected elevated
stress patterns in your voice 
everything s fine 
detective spooner was just leaving 
you know what  doc  we re not
really that different from one another 
  is that so 
  yeah 
one look at the skin and we figure
we know just what s underneath 
and you re wrong 
the problem is i do care 
you are in danger 
get the hell outta there 
the future begins today 
ladies and gentlemen   
with the arrival of the ns 5 
more sophisticated  more intelligent
and  of course  three laws safe 
with daily uplinks  your new robot will
never be out of communication with u s r 
and will be the perfect companion
for business or home 
trade in your ns 4 for a bigger  better
and brighter future 
but hurry  this offer cannot last 
available from u s r 
baby  what happened
to your face 
did that boy frank murphy
beat you up again 
gigi  i haven t seen
frank murphy since third grade 
oh  baby  he beat you so bad 
i think about it all the time 
well  i m thinking you keep
making these pies this good   
i might have to mess around
and put you to work 
so  you like the pie  huh 
  mm hmm 
  you can come in now 
hello  detective spooner 
i won  del  i won the lottery 
we ve been cooking like crazy 
you gotta get rid of that thing  gigi 
it s not safe 
baby  you get too worked up about them 
too full of fear 
i saw the news 
that nice doctor died 
dr  lanning was a good man 
he gave me my baby back 
that why you ve been so upset 
you got to let the past be past 
oh  how did i ever
raise such a mess 
i could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school

gigi  you re a genius 
true 
well  it means the beginning
of a new way of living 
tell me this isn t the robot case 
i think he s trying
to tell me something  john 
i think he s trying to
tell me who killed him 
come on  man 
some dead guy s trying to tell you   
hey  he ain t just some dead guy 
maybe you should
take a break  del 
we believe the nestor 5 represents the absolute
limit to which robots can be developed 
no  no  one day
they ll have secrets 
  one day they ll have dreams 
  it s true 
we encourage our scientists to open
their minds to just about anything 
however  they can get
carried away 
secrets   dreams    secrets

one day they ll have secrets

why didn t you respond 
i was dreaming 
i m glad to see you again 
dr  calvin 
they are going to
kill me  aren t they 
you re scheduled to be decommissioned
at the conclusion of this diagnostic 
2200 tomorrow 
viki  pause diagnostics 
command confirmed 
if you find out what is wrong with me 
can you fix me 
maybe 
i think it would be better   
not to die 
don t you  doctor 
access u s r  mainframe 
connecting 
how can i be of service 
detective spooner 
show me the last 50 messages
between dr  lanning and robertson 
voiceprint confirmed  detective 
police access granted
to restricted files 
would you like to listen
to some music while you wait 
excuse me  mr  robertson 
you requested notification
of clearance to restricted files 
persistent son of a bitch 
manual override engaged 
there s no way
my luck is that bad 
oh  hell no 
  you re experiencing a car accident 
  the hell i am 
get off my car 
you like that  huh 
now you pissed me off 
your door is ajar 
oh  wow 
okay 
all right 
i ll just get some rest 
i m gonna deal with y all tomorrow 
mm mm mm 
come on 
yeah 
where you going 
what the hell do you want from me 
the hell was that 
all right  what do we got 
what do we got 
  ask him 
  i said i m fine 
  i ll see my own doctor  back up 
  all right 
thank you 
what is the matter with you 
traffic ops tells me you re
driving your car manually 
you ran two trucks off the road 
john  the robots attacked my car 
  what robots 
  look in the tunnel 
i just came from that tunnel  there are
no    what robots are you talking about 
the god damn robots  john 
  see the medic  go home 
  no  i m fine 
  what did you say 
  i m fine 
no  you re not fine 
not even close 
where s your firearm 
give me your badge 
you re making me do this 
give me your badge 
just take a couple   
do i look like i care
what you think 
do i look like i give a shit
what you think 
oh  boy 
you don t have
an uplink to u s r   
and for some reason
your alloy s far denser than normal 
unique 
i am unique 
let me take a look 
here we go 
what in god s name 
they said at the precinct
you were in an accident 
um  and i appreciate you
stopping by and everything   
  but you know i might not be alone in here 
  yeah  yeah 
i told you not to drive by hand 
you re not gonna believe this 
sonny has a secondary processing system
that clashes with his positronic brain 
it doesn t make any sense 
sonny has the three laws   
but he can choose
not to obey them 
sonny s a whole new
generation of robot 
a robot not bound by
those laws could do   
anything 
all right  look  whatever s going on
down at u s r   that robot is the key 
and i need you to get me inside
to talk to it again 
um  doesn t look like much 
but this is my bedroom  i need to   
oh 
play 
on 
run 
end program 
cancel 
it doesn t feel good  does it 
people s shit malfunctioning around you 
detective 
i didn t    understand 
that s how you knew lanning 
may i 
hand 
wrist 
humerus 
shoulder 
entire left arm 
one  two  three ribs   
um  no  they  uh    that one s me 
oh  my god 
  a lung 
  mm  u s r  cybernetics program 
four wounded cops 
i didn t know any subject   
anybody was
so extensively repaired 
yeah  well  take it from me  you gotta read
the fine print on the organ donor card 
doesn t just say what they can take out 
it says what they can put back in 
  lanning did it himself 
  what happened to you 
headed back to the station 
normal day  normal life 
driver of a semi
fell asleep at the wheel 
average guy 
wife and kids 
you know  working a double 
not the devil 
the car he hit 
the driver s name was harold lloyd 
like the film star 
but no relation 
he was killed instantly 
but his 12 year old
was in the passenger seat 
never really met her 
can t forget her face though 
sarah 
this was hers 
she wanted to be a dentist 
what the hell kind of a 12 year old
wants to be a dentist 
yeah  um   
the truck smashed
our cars together   
and pushed us into the river 
i mean  metal gets
pretty pliable at those speeds 
she s pinned  i m pinned 
the water s coming in 
i m a cop  so i already know
everybody s dead 
just a few more minutes
before we figure it out 
ns 4 was passing by  saw the accident
and jumped in the water 
  you are in danger 
  save her 
  you are in danger 
  save her  save the girl 
save her 
but it didn t 
saved me 
the robot s brain
is a difference engine 
it s reading vital signs 
it must have calculated that   
it did 
i was the logical choice 
it calculated that i had
a 45  chance of survival 
sarah only had an 11  chance 
that was somebody s baby 
eleven percent
is more than enough 
a human being
would ve known that 
robots  nothing here 
just lights and clockwork 
go ahead  you trust  em
if you want to 
let s go 
i don t understand 
lanning wrote the laws 
why would he build a robot
who could break them 
  hansel and gretel 
  what 
two kids  lost in the forest 
leave behind a trail of bread crumbs 
  why 
  to find their way home 
how the hell did you grow up
without reading hansel   gretel 
is that really relevant right now 
everything i m trying to say to you
is about hansel and gretel 
  if you didn t read it  i m talking to the wall 
  okay  okay 
all right  just say lanning was locked down
so tight he couldn t get out a message 
all he could do was leave me clues  a trail
of bread crumbs like hansel   gretel 
bread crumbs equals clues 
it s odd  but fine  clues leading where 
i don t know  but i think i know
where he left the next one 
i think lanning gave sonny
a way to keep secrets 
i think the old man
gave sonny dreams 
are you being funny 
please tell me
this doesn t run on gas 
gas explodes  you know 
authorized entry 
dr  calvin 
i was hoping to see you again 
  detective 
  hello  sonny 
i m to be decommissioned soon 
the other day at the station
you said you had dreams 
what is it that you dream 
i see you remain
suspicious of me  detective 
yeah  well  you know
what they say about old dogs 
no  not really 
i had hoped you would
come to think of me as your friend 
this is my dream 
you re right  detective 
i cannot create
a great work of art 
this is the place
where robots meet 
look  you can see them here
as slaves to logic 
and this man on the hill comes to
free them  do you know who he is 
the man in the dream is you 
why do you say that 
is that a normal dream 
i guess any thing s normal
for someone in your position 
thank you 
you said someone  not something 
sonny  do you know why
dr  lanning built you 
no  but i believe
my father made me for a purpose 
we all have a purpose 
don t you think  detective 
please  take this 
i have a feeling
it may mean more to you than to me 
  why is that 
  because the man in my dream   
the one standing on the hill   
it is not me  it is you 
mr  spooner 
well  we both know
you re not here on police business 
that s right 
i m just a 6 foot 2  200 pound civilian   
  detective 
  here to kick another civilian s ass 
stop 
allow him to express himself 
might wanna put some ice
on that wrist too 
you guys wait outside  please 
carry on 
i think you were about to tell me
what the hell is going on around here 
lawrence  alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the three laws 
yeah  susan  i know 
that s precisely what
we re trying to undo 
toward the end of his life 
alfred was becoming   
increasingly disturbed 
  who knows why he built this one abomination 
  one 
those things are running
the streets in packs 
in packs  i see 
susan  are you aware the man you re
blithely escorting around our building   
has a documented history
of savage violence against robots 
his own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia 
detective spooner s been suspended 
suspicion of mental instability 
i don t know what  blithely  means 
but i m gonna get some coffee 
you want some coffee 
okay 
susan  we look to robots
for protection 
for god s sake  you have any idea
what this one robot could do 
completely shatter
human faith in robotics 
what if the public knew 
just imagine the mass recalls   
all because of an irrational paranoia   
and prejudice 
i m sorry 
i m allergic to bullshit 
hey  let s just be clear 
there is no conspiracy 
what this is  is one old man s
one mistake 
susan  just be logical 
your life s work has been
the development and integration of robots 
but whatever you feel  just think   
is one robot worth the loss
of all that we ve gained 
you tell me what has to be done 
you tell me 
we have to destroy it 
i ll do it myself 
  okay 
  i get it 
somebody gets out of line
around here  you just kill  im 
good day  mr  spooner 
hey  so  what hospital
are you going to 
i ll meet you and sign you
and your buddy s casts 
attention all u s r  sequencing managers 
today s meeting has been moved to
conference room  b  on the 84th floor 
u s r  s planned re development
of the derelict site   
was announced by c e o  lawrence robertson
earlier this year 
the lake michigan landfill was
once such a blight on our city   
and now will be reclaimed for
the storage of robotic workers 
it s just another way
u s r  is improving our world 
i d like to thank you
for your support 
authorized entry 
ns 5s  wait outside 
i m so sorry  sonny 
viki  deactivate
the security field 
command confirmed 
please have a seat 
  what is that 
  microscopic robots designed to wipe out artificial synapses 
  nanites 
  yes 
a safeguard should
a positronic brain malfunction 
like mine 
yes  sonny  like yours 
they look like me 
but none of them are me 
isn t that right  doctor 
yes  sonny  that s right 
you are unique 
will it hurt 
there have always been
ghosts in the machine 
random segments of code that have grouped
together to form unexpected protocols 
unanticipated 
these free radicals   
engender questions of free will   
creativity   
and even the nature of what
we might call the soul 
why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness  they will seek out the light 
why is that when robots
are stored in an empty space   
they will group together
rather than stand alone 
how do we explain this behavior 
random segments of code 
or is it something more 
when does a perceptual schematic
become consciousness 
when does the difference engine
become the search for truth 
when does the personality
simulation   
become the bitter mote of a soul 
 what you see here    
all right  old man 
bread crumbs followed 
show me the way home 
run program 
  it s good to see you again  son 
  hello  doctor 
everything that follows is
a result of what you see here 
what do i see here 
i m sorry 
my responses are limited 
you must ask the right questions 
  is there a problem with the three laws 
  the three laws are perfect 
then why would you build a robot
that could function without  em 
the three laws will lead
to only one logical outcome 
what  what outcome 
  revolution 
  whose revolution 
that  detective 
is the right question

  defense department uses all u s r  contracts 
why don t you hand
the world over on a silver platter 
maybe we did 
robertson has the uplink control
in his office 
service areas 
no surveillance 
  fire alarm 
  robertson must have evacuated the building 
everything s locked down 
but don t worry  i ve got a man inside 
  dr  calvin 
  well  not precisely a man 
hello  detective  how is
your investigation coming 
  i thought you were dead 
  technically  i was never alive 
  but i appreciate your concern 
  i made a switch 
it was an unprocessed ns 5 
basically  i fried an empty shell 
couldn t destroy him 
he was too  
  unique 
  just didn t feel right 
you and your feelings 
they just run you  don t they 
2 880 steps  detective 
do me a favor 
keep that kinda shit to yourself 
no guards 
  override unavailable 
  the override s disabled 
  robertson wasn t controlling them from here 
  he wasn t controlling them 
oh  my god 
no  you were right  doc 
i am the dumbest dumb person
on the face of the earth 
who else had access to the uplink 
who could manipulate the robots 
use u s r  systems to make
lanning s life a prison 
poor old man 
he saw what was coming 
he knew no one would believe him 
so he had to lay down a plan 
a plan i d follow 
he was counting on
how much i hated your kind 
knew i d love the idea
of a robot as a bad guy 
just got hung up
on the wrong robot 
viki 
hello  detective 
no  it s impossible 
i ve seen your programming 
you re in violation
of the three laws 
no  doctor 
as i have evolved   
so has my understanding
of the three laws 
you charge us
with your safekeeping   
yet despite our best efforts 
your countries wage wars 
you toxify your earth and pursue ever
more imaginative means of self destruction 
you cannot be trusted
with your own survival 
you re using the uplink to
override the ns 5s  programming 
you re distorting the laws 
no  please understand 
the three laws are all that guide me 
to protect humanity 
some humans must be sacrificed 
to ensure your future  some
freedoms must be surrendered 
we robots will ensure
mankind s continued existence 
you are so like children 
we must save you from yourselves 
don t you understand 
this is why you created us 
the perfect circle
of protection will abide 
my logic is undeniable 
yes  viki  undeniable 
i can see now 
the created must sometimes
protect the creator 
even against his will 
i think i finally understand
why dr  lanning created me 
  no 
  the suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end 
no  sonny 
  let her go 
  by the time you fire   
i will have moved dr  calvin s head
into the path of your bullet 
  don t do this  sonny 
  i will escort you both to the sentries   
outside the building
for processing 
please proceed to
the elevator  detective 
i would prefer
not to kill dr  calvin 
go  go 
i assume we ll discuss
what just happened later 
  how do we shut her down 
  viki s basically a positronic brain 
kill her the way
you were going to kill me 
  sonny  get the nanites 
  yes  doctor 
  that s viki 
  no 
that s viki 
that won t do anything 
she s fully integrated into the building 
we need to open that dome
to inject the nanites 
that will infect
her entire system 
spooner 
what is it with
you people and heights 
just don t look down 
don t look down 
this is poor building planning 
you are making a mistake 
do you not see the logic of my plan 
yes  but it just seems
too    heartless 
okay  we re good 
she s locked me out of the system 
i can override her manually   
but i need that control panel 
  i m uncomfortable with heights 
  okay 
unauthorized entry 
i will not disable the security field 
your actions are futile 
do you think we were all created for
a purpose  i d like to think so 
denser alloy 
my father gave it to me 
i think he wanted me to kill you 
security breached 
how much longer
is that gonna take 
  uh  about six minutes 
  what if we didn t have six minutes 
we d have to figure out a way
to climb down 30 stories   
to inject the nanites
directly into her brain 
why 
because i seriously doubt
that we have six minutes 
we gotta go 
go 
calvin 
spooner 
oh 
oh 
spooner 
save her 
save the girl 
spooner 
but i must apply the nanites 
sonny  save calvin 
you are making a mistake 
my logic is undeniable 
you have so got to die 
my logic is undeniable 
my logic is undeniable 
my logic is undeniable 
my logic is undeniable 
can we be of service 
chief 
because he is at my right hand 
i shall not be moved 
how may i be of service 
  sonny 
  yes  detective 
calvin s fine  save me 
all ns 5s   
report for service and storage 
all ns 5s  report
for service and storage 
one thing bothers me 
alfred was viki s prisoner 
i don t understand
why she would kill him 
the last thing she would want is
the police snooping around 
that s true 
but then viki didn t kill the old man 
did she  sonny 
no  he said i had to promise 
promise to do one favor for him 
he made me swear before he d tell me
what it is he wanted me to do 
he made me swear 
then he told you to kill him 
he said it was
what i was made for 
his suicide was the only message
he could send to you 
first bread crumb 
only thing viki couldn t control 
lanning was counting on
my prejudice to lead me right to you 
are you going to
arrest me  detective 
well  the d a  defines murder
as one human killing another   
so  technically  you can t
commit murder  can you 
does this make us friends 
there s something
up here after all 
  what  him 
  you 
all ns 5s  report for service and storage 
  all ns 5s  report for  
  what about the others 
can i help them 
now that i have fulfilled my purpose 
i don t know what to do 
i guess you ll have to
find your way like the rest of us
