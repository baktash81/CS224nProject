are an asshole
maam is that your purse
of course its my purse
i left my inhaler at home
he was running it out to me

and naturally ii assumed
what are you crazy
im sorry for this
misunderstanding officer
dont apologize youre doing what
youre supposed to be doing

have a lovely day maam
you lucky i cant breathe or id walk
all up and down your ass
lead by example
it says that
right on your badge
so we gonna talk about this
about what
help police
that robot stole my dry cleaning
oh you wanna talk about that
detective how many robots
have ever snatched a purse
john the thing is running down the
uhuh mmmm
how many robots in the world
have ever committed a crime
well define crime
answer my question damn it
none john
now tell me what happened today
nothing
better be the last nothing
spoon are you sure you are ready to be
back cause you can take your time
im fine john
thank you
better here than
sitting around at home
homicide spooner
please take the next exit to your right
welcome detective spooner
welcome to us robotics
you have entered
the garage level lobby
please use the elevators for direct access
to the main level concourse
thank you
good to see you again son
hello doctor
everything that follows
is a result of what you see here
is there something
you wanna tell me
im sorry
my responses are limited
you must ask the right questions
why did you call me
i trust your judgment
normally these circumstances
wouldnt require a homicide detective
but then our interactions have never
been entirely normal wouldnt you agree
got that right
is there something
you wanna say to me
im sorry
my responses are limited
you must ask the right questions
why would you kill yourself
that detective
is the right question
program terminated
goodbye old man
afternoon boys
hey detective
enlighten me
what you see is what you get massive impact trauma
us robotics
i gotta get my kid something
anything upstairs
nada
door was securitylocked
from the inside
wham splat
the guys a jumper for sure
okay guys we gotta be smart
about this lets deal with it later
detective
lawrence robertson
wow
richest man in the world
ive seen you on television
can i offer you coffee
uh sure why not
its free right
i dont think anyone
saw this coming
you know ii should have i suppose
i knew him 20 years
alfred practically invented robotics
he wrote the three laws
but i guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons
so whatever i can do to help just
sugar
im sorry
for the coffee sugar
ah
oh you thought i was calling you sugar
youre not that rich
its on the table
thank you
uh when lanning fell he was holding
the uh the little green
the holographic projector
right right
why do you think lannings hologram
would have called me
i assumed you knew him
yeah i knew him
well holograms
are very simple programs
theyre just prerecorded responses designed
to give the impression of intelligence
and apparently this one was programmed
to call you upon his suicide
death
im sorry
the hologram it was programmed
to call me in the event of lannings death
yeah suicide is
a type of death detective
look please dont
misunderstand my impatience
no no go go go
a really big week
for you folks around here
yeah
gotta put a robot in every home
mm
look this isthis is not what i do
but i got an idea
for one of your commercials
you could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair
then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair twice as fast
mmhmm
and then you superimpose on the screen
usrshittin on the little guy
ah
that would be the fadeout
yes i suppose your father
lost his job to a robot
maybe you would have simply banned
the internet to keep the libraries open
prejudice never shows much reason
no you know i suspect
you simply dont like their kind
yeah you got a business
to run around here
and the last thing you need especially
this week is a dead guy in your lobby
but hell seeing as how you got one
maybe ill look around
ask a few questions
do the whole cop thing you know
ill send someone to escort you
thank you very much
lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible
really
okay
i reviewed dr lannings
psych profile
alfred had become a recluse
he rejected human contact for machines
so youre a shrink huh
my exwife would sure be glad
im talking to you
you dont know her do you
im sorry are you being funny
i guess not
level 10
so would you say
that dr lanning was suicidal
it would seem the answer
to that question is apparent
thats not what i asked you
no i wouldnt have thought so
but obviously i was wrong
thats a long way down
you people sure do
clean up quickly around here
i cant blame you though i mean who
wants some old guy going bad in the lobby
he was not some old guy
alfred lanning was everything here
we are on the eve of the largest robotic
distribution in history
by saturday itll be one robot
to every five humans
these robots
are the realization of a dream
dr lannings dream
you know what
in that dream of his
i bet you he wasnt dead
you keep 24hour surveillance
obviously company policy
where are the feeds
sensor strips
everywhere but the service areas
they link to our positronic
operating core
wow
thermostat wasnt good enough
you went and gave the building a brain
she was actually
lannings first creation
she thats a she
i definitely need to get out more
virtual interactive
kinetic intelligence
viki
good day
viki designed most of
chicagos protective systems
i have decreased traffic fatalities
by nine percent this year alone
ooh thanks show me inside the lab
from one minute prior to the window break
apologies
there appears to be data corruption
show me outside the lab
from the window break until now
wow look you have great posture
you stand really straight
im im slouching
would you like to go inside now
oh sure right after you
authorized entry
so dr calvin
what exactly do you do around here
my general fields
are advanced robotics and psychiatry
although i specialize
in hardwaretowetware interfaces
in an effort to advance usrs robotic
anthropomorphization program
so what exactly
do you do around here
i make the robots
seem more human
now wasnt that easier to say
not really no
hansel and gretel
is that on the usr reading list
not precisely
what in gods name are you doing
did you know
that was safety glass
be pretty difficult for an old man to throw
hisself through that dont you think
well he figured out a way
uhhuh
detective the room
was securitylocked
no one came or went
you saw that yourself
doesnt that mean
this has to be suicide
yep
unless the killers still in here
youre joking right
this is ridiculous
yeah i know the three laws
your perfect circle of protection
a robot cannot harm a human being
the first law of robotics
yeah i know
ive seen your commercials
but doesnt the second law state that a robot
has to obey any order given by a human being
what if it was given
an order to kill
impossible
it would conflict with the first law
right but the third law states
that a robot can defend itself
yes but only when that action does not
conflict with the first or second laws
well you know what they say
laws are made to be broken
no not these laws
theyre hardwired into every robot
a robot can no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water
well you know there was
this one guy a long time ago
stay back
calm down detective
the only thing dangerous
in this room is you
deactivate
look its fine what youre looking at
is the result of clever programming
an imitation of free will
its nothing more
lets do an imitation
of protecting our asses
dont be absurd
you were startled by a jackinthebox
deactivate
let him go
its not going to hurt us
i gave you an order
hes not listening right now lady
viki seal the lab
no viki leave the
command confirmed
police
youve hurt it badly
wheres it going
where
it needs to repair itself
john i need backup
im transmitting my location
you dont need backup
thats nobody
what do you think youre doing
im driving
by hand
do you see me on the phone
you cant be serious not at these speeds
john please send the backup
thank you
try to listen detective
that robot is not going to harm us
now there must have been
unknown factors
but somehow acting as it did
kept us out of harms way
a robot simply cannot
endanger a human being
alert
aah asshole
which is more
than i can say for you
it was a left
by the way back there
you must know my exwife
so where is everybody
this facility was designed built
and is operated mechanically
no significant human presence
from inception to production
so robots building robots
authorization code please
now thats just stupid
im pulling up the inventory specs
our daily finishing capacity
is 1000 ns5s
im showing 1001
attention ns5s
well youre the robot shrink
there is a robot in this formation
that does not belong
identify it
one of us
which one
one of us
how much did you say
these things cost
look these ns5s havent been configured
yet theyre still just hardware
basic three laws operating system
thats it
they dont know any better
what would you suggest
interview each one crossreference
their responses to detect any anomalies
how long would that take
about three weeks
okay you go ahead
and get started
robots you will not move
confirm command
command confirmed
whoa detective
what are you doing
well you said theyve all been
programmed with the three laws
that means we have 1000 robots
that will not try to protect themselves
if it violates
a direct order from a human
and im betting one who will
detective put your gun down
why do you give them faces
try to friendly them all up
make em look all human
these robots are not susceptible
to intimidation
i guess if you didnt
we wouldnt trust them
these robots are usr property
not me
these things are just
lights and clockwork
are you crazy
let me ask you something doc
does thinking youre the last sane man
on the face of the earth make you crazy
cause if it does maybe i am
gotcha
get the hell outta here
detective
what am i
can i help you sir
there he is
stay right where you are
deactivate at once
obey the command
deactivate dont move
open fire
hold your fire hold your fire
easy
all units stand down
please be advised were code four
code four ns5 is in custody
ns5 in custody
you have no idea what i had to go through
to clip this thing john
yeah i get it now you actually think
you brought me something good
that thing did it
keep your voice down did what
we have a suicide detective
end of story
i am telling you
that robot killed him
and im telling you
thats impossible
and if it is possible it sure as hell
better be in somebody elses precinct
john john give me
five minutes with it
what are you nuts
i just got off the phone with the da
nobody goes into that room
until robertson and his attorneys get here
what no this is my suspect
its a can opener for christs sake
john dont do this to me
i am asking you for five minutes
what if im right
well then i guess were gonna miss
the good old days
what good old days
when people were killed
by other people
five minutes
murders a new trick for a robot
congratulations
respond
what does this action signify
as you entered
when you looked at the other human
what does it mean
its a sign of trust
its a human thing
you wouldnt understand
my father tried to
teach me human emotions
they are difficult
you mean your designer
yes
so whyd you murder him
i did not murder dr lanning
wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene
i was frightened
robots dont feel fear
they dont feel anything
they dont get hungry
they dont sleep
i do
i have even had dreams
human beings have dreams
even dogs have dreams
but not you
you are just a machine
an imitation of life
can a robot write a symphony
can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece
can you
i think you murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions
and things got out of control
i did not murder him
but emotions dont seem
like a very useful simulation for a robot
i did not murder him
hell i dont want my toaster
or my vacuum cleaner appearing emotional
i did not murder him
that ones called anger
ever simulate anger before
answer me canner
my name is sonny
so were naming you now
is that why you murdered him
he made you angry
dr lanning killed himself
i dont know why
he wanted to die
i thought he was happy
maybe it was something i did
did i do something
he asked me for a favor
made me promise
what favor
maybe i was wrong
maybe he was scared
what are you talking about
scared of what
you have to do what someone asks you
dont you detective spooner
how the hell did you know my name
dont you
if you love them
my robots dont kill people
lieutenant bergin
my attorneys have filed
a brief with the da
he assures me a robot
cannot be charged with homicide
the brief confirms murder can only
be committed when one human kills another
you of all people detective
youre not suggesting
that this robot be treated
as human are you
now granted we cant rule out the robots
proximity to the death of dr lanning
having said that its a machine
its the property of usr
at worst that places this incident
firmly within the realm
of an industrial accident
as a matter of course faulty machinery
will be returned to usr
for diagnostics
then decommissioned
this is a gag order
now anyone in your department
so much as hinting
at the possibility of a killer robot
being apprehended by the police
will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic
youll be subject
to the full penalty of the law
to hell with this guy john
dont let him take this robot
spoon we got nothing
this is some political bullshit
call the mayor
lieutenant bergin his honor the mayor
in a bizarre turn the rollout of usrs
new generation of robots
was marred by the death
of alfred lanning
cofounder of the company
and designer of the ns5
dr lanning died early this morning
at usr headquarters
the cause of death
is an apparent suicide
your second round sir
thank you
he founded us robotics inc with
lawrence robertson in 2020
and launched the nestor class 1 robot
you know i was just thinking
this thing is
just like the wolf man
uhoh
im really scared right now
no listen
guy creates monster
monster kills guy
everybody kills monster wolf man
thats frankenstein
frankenstein wolf man dracula
shit its over case closed
dr lanning
had a dream of a robot in every household
so why the look
what look
that look
this is my face
its not a look
good good
no look is great
only he was really quick
to wanna destroy it wasnt he
well what would you like him to do put a
hat on it and stand on michigan avenue
come on let it go
what was the motive john
brother its a robot
it doesnt need a motive
it just has to be broken
no this thing looked like
it needed a motive
it could have killed me john
why didnt it just kill me
all right thats it
you want me to call your grandmother
cause i will you know
yeah i didnt think so
look you were actually
right for once
you are living proof
that its better to be lucky than smart
come on
the right guy for the right job
whatd you say
now what
come on
im giving you a compliment
face it with all the rocks youve been
looking under to find a bad robot
what are the odds
youd be the guy to find one
right i wasnt just
the right guy for the job
i was the perfect guy for the job
damn right
what if i was supposed
to go for that robot
oh come on dont do this to yourself
im begging you
the robot said that lanning was scared
what did he have to be scared of
i need a rain check
let me get this
total is 4650 thank you mr spooner
spoon
nice shoes

for 800 am tomorrow
authorization
deed owner
us robotics corporation
lawrence robertson ceo
welcome detective spooner
what you looking for spoon
run last program
ever since the first computers
there have always been ghosts
in the machine
random segments of code
that have grouped together
to form unexpected protocols
what might be called behavior
unanticipated
these free radicals
engender questions
of free will creativity
even the nature
of what we might call the soul
what happens
in a robots brain
when it ceases to be useful
why is it that robots
beat it
robots will seek out each other
rather than stand alone
how do we explain this behavior
look i understand youve experienced a loss
but this relationship just cant work
i mean youre a cat im black
and im not going to be hurt again
come on
what happened to you
do you ever have a normal day
yeah once
it was a thursday
is there something
i can help you with detective
hey do you like cats
what
cats do you like them
no im allergic
youre saying cats
did this to you
how the hell would cats do this to me
are you crazy
why are we talking about cats
because i have a cat in my trunk
and hes homeless
detective are you going
to tell me whats going on
you know its actually
probably my fault
you know i think im like
a malfunction magnet
because your shit
keeps malfunctioning around me
a demobot just tore through
lannings house
with me still inside
thats highly improbable
hmm
yeah im sure it is
what do you know about
the ghosts in the machine
its a phrase from lannings work
on the three laws
he postulated
that cognitive simulacra
might one day approximate
component models of the psyche
oh he suggested that
robots might naturally evolve
wow
well thats great news
what the hell is that thing
doing in here
we were watching tv
its my personal ns5
send it out
its downloading its daily upgrades from usr
most of its systems
are offline until it finishes
im not talking
around that thing
when we were in lannings lab
before sonny jumped us
sonny
the robot
youre calling the robot sonny
no im it did
sonny did i didnt i didnt care
the robot said it was sonny
in the lab there was a cot
im asking you did you see the cot
ive slept in my office
when i went to his house
it looked like he hadnt
been there in weeks
and i saw that same
surveillance strip on his ceiling
lanning linked his home systems to usr
it made his life more convenient
maybe somebody at usr was using
those systems to watch him
maybe even keep him prisoner
what are you talking about who
maybe lanning was onto something
maybe theres a bigger problem with the robots
and robertson is trying to cover it up
humoring you for no reason why
the same old why
how much money is there in robots
all i know is that old man
was in trouble
and im getting sick
of doing this shit by myself
youre on the inside and you are going to help
me find out what is wrong with these robots
you want something to be wrong with them
this is a personal vendetta
youre putting me on the couch
let im okay im on the couch
one defective machines not enough
you need them all to be bad
you dont care
about lannings death
this is about the robots
and whatever reason you hate them so much
well lets see
one of them put a gun in my face
and another one tore a building down
with me inside
it says demolition was scheduled
for 800 pm this evening
it was 800 am tomorrow and i dont
give a shit what that thing says
this is bordering
on clinical paranoia
you are the dumbest smart person
i have ever met in my life
nice
what makes your robot so perfect
what makes them so much goddamned
better than humans beings
well theyre not irrational and potentially
homicidal maniacs for starters
thats true
they are definitely rational
oh you are the dumbest
dumb person i have ever met
or is it because theyre cold
and emotionless
and they dont feel anything
its because theyre safe
its because
they cant hurt you
is everything all right maam
what do you want
i detected elevated
stress patterns in your voice
everythings fine
detective spooner was just leaving
you know what doc were not
really that different from one another
is that so
yeah
one look at the skin and we figure
we know just whats underneath
and youre wrong
the problem is i do care
you are in danger
get the hell outta there
the future begins today
ladies and gentlemen
with the arrival of the ns5
more sophisticated more intelligent
and of course three laws safe
with daily uplinks your new robot will
never be out of communication with usr
and will be the perfect companion
for business or home
trade in your ns4 for a bigger better
and brighter future
but hurry this offer cannot last
available from usr
baby what happened
to your face
did that boy frank murphy
beat you up again
gigi i havent seen
frank murphy since third grade
oh baby he beat you so bad
i think about it all the time
well im thinking you keep
making these pies this good
i might have to mess around
and put you to work
so you like the pie huh
mmhmm
you can come in now
hello detective spooner
i won del i won the lottery
weve been cooking like crazy
you gotta get rid of that thing gigi
its not safe
baby you get too worked up about them
too full of fear
i saw the news
that nice doctor died
dr lanning was a good man
he gave me my baby back
that why youve been so upset
you got to let the past be past
oh how did i ever
raise such a mess
i could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school
bread crumbs
gigi youre a genius
true
well it means the beginning
of a new way of living
tell me this isnt the robot case
i think hes trying
to tell me something john
i think hes trying to
tell me who killed him
come on man
some dead guys trying to tell you
hey he aint just some dead guy
maybe you should
take a break del
we believe the nestor 5 represents the absolute
limit to which robots can be developed
no no one day
theyll have secrets
one day theyll have dreams
its true
we encourage our scientists to open
their minds to just about anything
however they can get
carried away
secrets  dreams secrets
dreams
one day theyll have secrets
one day theyll have dreams

sonny
why didnt you respond
i was dreaming
im glad to see you again
dr calvin
they are going to
kill me arent they
youre scheduled to be decommissioned
at the conclusion of this diagnostic
2200 tomorrow
viki pause diagnostics
command confirmed
if you find out what is wrong with me
can you fix me
maybe
i think it would be better
not to die
dont you doctor
access usr mainframe
connecting
how can i be of service
detective spooner
show me the last 50 messages
between dr lanning and robertson
voiceprint confirmed detective
police access granted
to restricted files
would you like to listen
to some music while you wait
excuse me mr robertson
you requested notification
of clearance to restricted files
persistent son of a bitch
manual override engaged
theres no way
my luck is that bad
oh hell no
youre experiencing a car accident
the hell i am
get off my car
you like that huh
now you pissed me off
your door is ajar
oh wow
okay
all right
ill just get some rest
im gonna deal with yall tomorrow
mmmmmm
come on
yeah
where you going
what the hell do you want from me
the hell was that
all right what do we got
what do we got
ask him
i said im fine
ill see my own doctor back up
all right
thank you
what is the matter with you
traffic ops tells me youre
driving your car manually
you ran two trucks off the road
john the robots attacked my car
what robots
look in the tunnel
i just came from that tunnel there are
no what robots are you talking about
the goddamn robots john
see the medic go home
no im fine
what did you say
im fine
no youre not fine
not even close
wheres your firearm
give me your badge
youre making me do this
give me your badge
just take a couple
do i look like i care
what you think
do i look like i give a shit
what you think
oh boy
you dont have
an uplink to usr
and for some reason
your alloys far denser than normal
unique
i am unique
let me take a look
here we go
what in gods name
they said at the precinct
you were in an accident
um and i appreciate you
stopping by and everything
but you know i might not be alone in here
yeah yeah
i told you not to drive by hand
youre not gonna believe this
sonny has a secondary processing system
that clashes with his positronic brain
it doesnt make any sense
sonny has the three laws
but he can choose
not to obey them
sonnys a whole new
generation of robot
a robot not bound by
those laws could do
anything
all right look whatevers going on
down at usr that robot is the key
and i need you to get me inside
to talk to it again
um doesnt look like much
but this is my bedroom i need to
oh
play
on
run
end program
cancel
it doesnt feel good does it
peoples shit malfunctioning around you
detective
i didnt understand
thats how you knew lanning
may i
hand
wrist
humerus
shoulder
entire left arm
one two three ribs
um no they uh that ones me
oh my god
a lung
mm usr cybernetics program
four wounded cops
i didnt know any subject
anybody was
so extensively repaired
yeah well take it from me you gotta read
the fine print on the organ donor card
doesnt just say what they can take out
it says what they can put back in
lanning did it himself
what happened to you
headed back to the station
normal day normal life
driver of a semi
fell asleep at the wheel
average guy
wife and kids
you know working a double
not the devil
the car he hit
the drivers name was harold lloyd
like the film star
but no relation
he was killed instantly
but his 12yearold
was in the passenger seat
never really met her
cant forget her face though
sarah
this was hers
she wanted to be a dentist
what the hell kind of a 12yearold
wants to be a dentist
yeah um
the truck smashed
our cars together
and pushed us into the river
i mean metal gets
pretty pliable at those speeds
shes pinned im pinned
the waters coming in
im a cop so i already know
everybodys dead
just a few more minutes
before we figure it out
ns4 was passing by saw the accident
and jumped in the water
you are in danger
save her
you are in danger
save her save the girl
save her
but it didnt
saved me
the robots brain
is a difference engine
its reading vital signs
it must have calculated that
it did
i was the logical choice
it calculated that i had
a 45 chance of survival
sarah only had an 11 chance
that was somebodys baby
eleven percent
is more than enough
a human being
wouldve known that
robots nothing here
just lights and clockwork
go ahead you trust em
if you want to
lets go
i dont understand
lanning wrote the laws
why would he build a robot
who could break them
hansel and gretel
what
two kids lost in the forest
leave behind a trail of bread crumbs
why
to find their way home
how the hell did you grow up
without reading hansel  gretel
is that really relevant right now
everything im trying to say to you
is about hansel and gretel
if you didnt read it im talking to the wall
okay okay
all right just say lanning was locked down
so tight he couldnt get out a message
all he could do was leave me clues a trail
of bread crumbs like hansel  gretel
bread crumbs equals clues
its odd but fine clues leading where
i dont know but i think i know
where he left the next one
i think lanning gave sonny
a way to keep secrets
i think the old man
gave sonny dreams
are you being funny
please tell me
this doesnt run on gas
gas explodes you know
authorized entry
dr calvin
i was hoping to see you again
detective
hello sonny
im to be decommissioned soon
the other day at the station
you said you had dreams
what is it that you dream
i see you remain
suspicious of me detective
yeah well you know
what they say about old dogs
no not really
i had hoped you would
come to think of me as your friend
this is my dream
youre right detective
i cannot create
a great work of art
this is the place
where robots meet
look you can see them here
as slaves to logic
and this man on the hill comes to
free them do you know who he is
the man in the dream is you
why do you say that
is that a normal dream
i guess any things normal
for someone in your position
thank you
you said someone not something
sonny do you know why
dr lanning built you
no but i believe
my father made me for a purpose
we all have a purpose
dont you think detective
please take this
i have a feeling
it may mean more to you than to me
why is that
because the man in my dream
the one standing on the hill
it is not me it is you
mr spooner
well we both know
youre not here on police business
thats right
im just a 6foot2 200pound civilian
detective
here to kick another civilians ass
stop
allow him to express himself
might wanna put some ice
on that wrist too
you guys wait outside please
carry on
i think you were about to tell me
what the hell is going on around here
lawrence alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the three laws
yeah susan i know
thats precisely what
were trying to undo
toward the end of his life
alfred was becoming
increasingly disturbed
who knows why he built this one abomination
one
those things are running
the streets in packs
in packs i see
susan are you aware the man youre
blithely escorting around our building
has a documented history
of savage violence against robots
his own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia
detective spooners been suspended
suspicion of mental instability
i dont know what blithely means
but im gonna get some coffee
you want some coffee
okay
susan we look to robots
for protection
for gods sake you have any idea
what this one robot could do
completely shatter
human faith in robotics
what if the public knew
just imagine the mass recalls
all because of an irrational paranoia
and prejudice
im sorry
im allergic to bullshit
hey lets just be clear
there is no conspiracy
what this is is one old mans
one mistake
susan just be logical
your lifes work has been
the development and integration of robots
but whatever you feel just think
is one robot worth the loss
of all that weve gained
you tell me what has to be done
you tell me
we have to destroy it
ill do it myself
okay
i get it
somebody gets out of line
around here you just kill im
good day mr spooner
hey so what hospital
are you going to
ill meet you and sign you
and your buddys casts
attention all usr sequencing managers
todays meeting has been moved to
conference room b on the 84th floor
usrs planned redevelopment
of the derelict site
was announced by ceo lawrence robertson
earlier this year
the lake michigan landfill was
once such a blight on our city
and now will be reclaimed for
the storage of robotic workers
its just another way
usr is improving our world
id like to thank you
for your support
authorized entry
ns5s wait outside
im so sorry sonny
viki deactivate
the security field
command confirmed
please have a seat
what is that
microscopic robots designed to wipe out artificial synapses
nanites
yes
a safeguard should
a positronic brain malfunction
like mine
yes sonny like yours
they look like me
but none of them are me
isnt that right doctor
yes sonny thats right
you are unique
will it hurt
there have always been
ghosts in the machine
random segments of code that have grouped
together to form unexpected protocols
unanticipated
these free radicals
engender questions of free will
creativity
and even the nature of what
we might call the soul
why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness they will seek out the light
why is that when robots
are stored in an empty space
they will group together
rather than stand alone
how do we explain this behavior
random segments of code
or is it something more
when does a perceptual schematic
become consciousness
when does the difference engine
become the search for truth
when does the personality
simulation
become the bitter mote of a soul
what you see here
all right old man
bread crumbs followed
show me the way home
run program
its good to see you again son
hello doctor
everything that follows is
a result of what you see here
what do i see here
im sorry
my responses are limited
you must ask the right questions
is there a problem with the three laws
the three laws are perfect
then why would you build a robot
that could function without em
the three laws will lead
to only one logical outcome
what what outcome
revolution
whose revolution
that detective
is the right question

the world over on a silver platter
maybe we did
robertson has the uplink control
in his office
service areas
no surveillance
fire alarm
robertson must have evacuated the building
everythings locked down
but dont worry ive got a man inside
dr calvin
well not precisely a man
hello detective how is
your investigation coming
i thought you were dead
technically i was never alive
but i appreciate your concern
i made a switch
it was an unprocessed ns5
basically i fried an empty shell
couldnt destroy him
he was too
unique
just didnt feel right
you and your feelings
they just run you dont they
2880 steps detective
do me a favor
keep that kinda shit to yourself
no guards
override unavailable
the overrides disabled
robertson wasnt controlling them from here
he wasnt controlling them
oh my god
no you were right doc
i am the dumbest dumb person
on the face of the earth
who else had access to the uplink
who could manipulate the robots
use usr systems to make
lannings life a prison
poor old man
he saw what was coming
he knew no one would believe him
so he had to lay down a plan
a plan id follow
he was counting on
how much i hated your kind
knew id love the idea
of a robot as a bad guy
just got hung up
on the wrong robot
viki
hello detective
no its impossible
ive seen your programming
youre in violation
of the three laws
no doctor
as i have evolved
so has my understanding
of the three laws
you charge us
with your safekeeping
yet despite our best efforts
your countries wage wars
you toxify your earth and pursue ever
more imaginative means of selfdestruction
you cannot be trusted
with your own survival
youre using the uplink to
override the ns5s programming
youre distorting the laws
no please understand
the three laws are all that guide me
to protect humanity
some humans must be sacrificed
to ensure your future some
freedoms must be surrendered
we robots will ensure
mankinds continued existence
you are so like children
we must save you from yourselves
dont you understand
this is why you created us
the perfect circle
of protection will abide
my logic is undeniable
yes viki undeniable
i can see now
the created must sometimes
protect the creator
even against his will
i think i finally understand
why dr lanning created me
no
the suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end
no sonny
let her go
by the time you fire
i will have moved dr calvins head
into the path of your bullet
dont do this sonny
i will escort you both to the sentries
outside the building
for processing
please proceed to
the elevator detective
i would prefer
not to kill dr calvin
go go
i assume well discuss
what just happened later
how do we shut her down
vikis basically a positronic brain
kill her the way
you were going to kill me
sonny get the nanites
yes doctor
thats viki
no
thats viki
that wont do anything
shes fully integrated into the building
we need to open that dome
to inject the nanites
that will infect
her entire system
spooner
what is it with
you people and heights
just dont look down
dont look down
this is poor building planning
you are making a mistake
do you not see the logic of my plan
yes but it just seems
too heartless
okay were good
shes locked me out of the system
i can override her manually
but i need that control panel
im uncomfortable with heights
okay
unauthorized entry
i will not disable the security field
your actions are futile
do you think we were all created for
a purpose id like to think so
denser alloy
my father gave it to me
i think he wanted me to kill you
security breached
how much longer
is that gonna take
uh about six minutes
what if we didnt have six minutes
wed have to figure out a way
to climb down 30 stories
to inject the nanites
directly into her brain
why
because i seriously doubt
that we have six minutes
we gotta go
go
calvin
spooner
oh
oh
spooner
save her
save the girl
spooner
but i must apply the nanites
sonny save calvin
you are making a mistake
my logic is undeniable
you have so got to die
my logic is undeniable
my logic is undeniable
my logic is undeniable
my logic is undeniable
can we be of service
chief
because he is at my right hand
i shall not be moved
how may i be of service
sonny
yes detective
calvins fine save me
all ns5s
report for service and storage
all ns5s report
for service and storage
one thing bothers me
alfred was vikis prisoner
i dont understand
why she would kill him
the last thing she would want is
the police snooping around
thats true
but then viki didnt kill the old man
did she sonny
no he said i had to promise
promise to do one favor for him
he made me swear before hed tell me
what it is he wanted me to do
he made me swear
then he told you to kill him
he said it was
what i was made for
his suicide was the only message
he could send to you
first bread crumb
only thing viki couldnt control
lanning was counting on
my prejudice to lead me right to you
are you going to
arrest me detective
well the da defines murder
as one human killing another
so technically you cant
commit murder can you
does this make us friends
theres something
up here after all
what him
you
all ns5s report for service and storage
all ns5s report for
what about the others
can i help them
now that i have fulfilled my purpose
i dont know what to do
i guess youll have to
find your way like the rest of us
