i ordered us a part that ll have us
up and running in no time 
you sure are putting a lot of effort
into fixing that big old light bulb 
a lighthouse without a light
is just a house 
and that s a problem because   
have i ever told you the story
of the beautiful lighthouse keeper 
the beautiful lighthouse keeper  no 
i think i would have remembered that 
well  once upon a time 
there was a beautiful lighthouse keeper 
wait  wait 
i thought that lighthouse keepers   
were old men in yellow raincoats
with long white beards 
oh  no  this one was a real hottie 
  she had long red hair  she was tall   
  yeah 
   and her body  it was the bomb 
anyway  her man was a sailor 
oh  i love sailors 
and he was afraid that she d find
someone else whenever he was away 
  no 
  so she said to him   
 as long as that light up there is lit   
 my heart will always be yours  
so  from then on 
whenever he was away at sea   
he could just look back
and he d see that light   
and he knew
that his true love still cared 
  frank 
  yes  my beautiful lighthouse keeper 
we re doing the right thing  aren t we 
  we ve had a bumpy start 
  yeah 
come here 
i wanna show you something 
  okay 
  look 
okay 
see that  that s the buddy system 
we re jelling as a family 
even as we speak 
yeah  you know  it just might work 
  you have to turn it over

hey  wow 
this place is shipshape 
well  you just had to  frank  didn t you 
  excuse me 
  you know  frank   
i understand your pathological need
to organize the rest of the house   
but this is my space 
i need just a little bit of respect 
you re killing me  frank 
did i miss something 
yes 
don t you think
you re overreacting just a little 
me  you know what 
never mind  frank 
you know 
you were gonna spank the boys   
over wrecking
your silly organizational chart   
but i m not allowed to be upset
about my studio 
i was not going to spank them 
and charts are not silly 
do you know what happens
to a ship in chaos  it sinks 
homes are for free expression 
not for good impressions 
well  i m sorry  but in the military 
there s little room for free expression 
except for that we re not in the military 
frank  you are 
i just thought that you would work better
in a clean studio 
i knew it  i knew you put them up to it 
i most certainly did not 
no  maybe not directly 
but in that whole orderly  military   
regimented brainwashing thing 
  you left out anal retentive 
  oh  and that  too 
is that what you think 
yes  that s what i think 
then i think
that i m sleeping somewhere else 
i m gonna fix that 
officer asleep 
go  kelly 
go  kelly 
be  be aggressive  be aggressive 
be  be aggressive  be aggressive 
be  be aggressive 
be aggressive

admiral beardsley and his wife helen   
for this wonderful evening 
frank  you run a tight ship

i m gonna offer my recommendation   
that admiral frank beardsley

wishing that you were home 
or you ll be in washington 
wishing that you were at sea 
let s all stand and applaud   
commandant frank beardsley 
thank you  commandant sherman 
i know that   
this command is
an incredible opportunity   
and a great honor 
but i ve just started here
at the academy   
and it would not be fair to my cadets   
nor would it be fair to my new family   
who just about outnumber the cadets 
and so  sir   
i must respectfully decline 
and i hope that you know
how honored i am 
think you might reconsider 
you wanna sleep on it

you sound like some military robot 
frank 
yeah  well  you sound like a big
free to be you and me flake

with having rules 
everybody lives by them 
the entire universe lives by them 
well  then  frank  that s the last thing
these kids need from me 
there s only one rule i know 
and that s   
 at any time  all of this could be over 
taken away from you forever  
and then who needs more rules
after that 
i can t live like this anymore  frank 
and neither can my kids 
i don t know how yours do it 
my kids got along just fine
until we moved in together 
  everything was shipshape 
  oh  frank

we got into this way too fast 
i thought we could just pick up
where we left off in high school

than we both realized 
maybe it was 
hey  you know what  frank
