 breathing heavily 
saw some turkeys on the way here 
crossed right in front of me
like i wasn t even there 
  how rude of them 
  that s what happens 
you spend six days a week
working in the mines
and stupid birds start to
think they own these woods 
when s the tour leave 
couple hours 
well  let s go 
 turkeys gobbling 
 gasps 
 breathing heavily 
hey  whoa  whoa  whoa 
hey  whoa  you re okay 
 screaming 
 turkeys gobbling 
you re okay  you re safe  you re safe 
it s okay  you re here with me 
you re with me 
 panting 
okay  okay 
i m sorry 
oh  we    we should   
we should go 
katniss  are you coming
to the train station 
i think you have enough
people saying goodbye without me there 
only a few i actually care about 
it might be easier if i didn t 
it s only a few weeks 
i ll be back before the snow melts 
yeah  a lot can happen in a few weeks 
are we gonna do this again 
gale  it was an act 
yeah  it was a good one 
i did what i had to do to survive 
if i didn t  i d be dead 
i had to do that 
at least once 
 hisses 
haymitch 
 bottles clinking 
haymitch 
haymitch  wake up  it s tour day 
haymitch 
 yelling 
what are you doing 
cameras are gonna be here in an hour 
if you wanted to be babied 
you should ve asked peeta 
peeta  asked me what 
haymitch  asked you to wake me
without giving me pneumonia 
you are a strangely dislikeable person 
but you do have your virtues 
would you like some bread  katniss 
no  i ate at the hob  but thank you 
you re welcome 
brr 
you two have a lot
of warming up to do before show time 
which is in an hour  so
take a bath  haymitch 
i just did 
did you have a good walk  dear 
  walk  i was just out 
  we have visitors 
miss everdeen  this way  please 
 door closes 
such bravery 
such spirit 
such   
contempt 
president snow 
what an honor 
my dear  i think we can make
this so much simpler
if we agree not to lie to each other 
what do you think 
yes  i think that would save time 
sit down  please 
i have a problem  miss everdeen 
a problem that began
the moment you revealed
those poison berries in the arena 
if that head gamemaker  seneca crane 
had had any brains at all 
he would have blown you
to bits then and there 
but here you are 
i expect you can guess where he is 
yes  i think so 
after that fiasco  there
was nothing left to do
but to let you play out
your little scenario 
and you were very good 
that whole love crazed 
besotted schoolgirl routine 
impressive  truly 
you convinced the people in the capitol 
unfortunately  not everyone
in the districts fell for it 
i mean  you can t know this 
but in several of them 
people viewed your little
trick with the berries
as an act of defiance 
not as an act of love 
and if a girl from
district 12 of all places
can defy the capitol
and walk away unharmed 
what is to prevent them
from doing the same 
what is to prevent  say 
an uprising 
that can lead to revolution 
and then  in a fraction of time 
the whole system collapses 
it must be a fragile system 
if it can be brought down
by just a few berries 
yes  it is  indeed 
but not in the way you imagine it 
how should i imagine 
you should imagine thousands upon
thousands of your people dead 
this town of yours reduced to ashes 
imagine it gone 
made radioactive  buried under dirt
as if it had never
existed  like district 13 
you fought very hard
in the games  miss everdeen 
but they were games 
would you like to be in a real war 
no 
good  neither would i 
did your mother make these 
peeta 
oh  he s a lovely boy 
tell me 
at what point did he
realize the depth of your
indifference towards him 
  i m not indifferent 
  don t lie 
you promised 
why don t you just kill me now 
i don t want to kill you 
i want us to be friends 
but if not friends  then allies 
what do i need to do 
when you and peeta are on tour 
you need to smile  you need to be grateful 
but  above all 
you need to be madly 
prepared to end it all in love 
you think you can manage that 
yes 
yes  what 
i ll convince them 
no 
convince me 
for you  miss everdeen 
 monitor switches on 
do convince me 
for the sake of your loved ones 
 door opens 
 door closes 
effie  stop 
take it all in 
this is sacred ground 
history was made here 
oh 
you ll get used to the smell 
hmm 
 sighs 
hello 
 gasps  oh

flavius  our little superstar 
 all cooing

 show theme playing 
welcome 
 audience cheering 
last year  the 74th hunger games
brought us the greatest
love story of our time 
two brave young people  against all odds
chose to die rather than
to lose each other 
as a nation  we shared their agony 
but we had so little time
to revel in their joy 
 gasps  it s time 
she s done  she s lovely 
we must feed the monster 
all right now 
caesar  let s go to district 12
and find our star crossed lovers 
you re excited  you re in love 
big smiles for the camera
in three  two  one 
caesar  there she is  katniss everdeen 
the girl on fire 
 caesar chuckles 
 audience cheering 
and there he is  peeta mellark 
the baker s boy 
 caesar chuckles 
 audience cheering 
ooh 
 grunts 
caesar  uh oh  whoa  oh 
trouble in paradise  chuckles 
i hope they re all right 
um   
 clears throat  ahem 
anyone at home 
 chuckles  should we come back later 
sorry  caesar 
 chuckles 
oh  please  it s all right  it s your day 
it s your day  so how s it going 
we re good 
that s it  that s all we get   we re good  
so taciturn all of a sudden 
peeta  give me some details 
 audience cheering 
yeah  things are  uh   
things are great here in 12 
thanks to the generosity of the capitol 
we ve never been closer 
25 yards  to be exact 
 chuckles 
 caesar laughs 
fantastic 
we ll be checking in with both of you
throughout the victory tour 
thank you so much 
katniss everdeen and peeta mellark 
 audience cheering 
 cameras power down 
effie  wonderful 
everybody in motion  we
are out of here in 10 
that was nice acting 
you  too 
almost thought that kiss was real 
effie  come along  children 
we are on a schedule 
the train awaits 
fabulous food  fabulous wine 
the massages  spa treatments  i told them
nothing but the best for my two victors 
it all needs to be  uh   
fabulous 
exactly 
now  the schedule is a bit of a bear 
12 days  12 districts 
but it s mostly parties  celebrations 
adoring fans to greet you
at every stop along the way 
and then we wrap it up in the capitol 
all you need to do is give a few speeches 
wave to the crowds 
and enjoy your time in the spotlight 
you ve earned it 
what did you say 
katniss 
i said   enjoy it  katniss 
you ve earned it  
by killing people 
young lady   
 indistinct radio chatter 
 computer beeps 
 door locks 
 door opens 
i m really not in the mood for a lecture 
i ll apologize to effie later 
i thought you were haymitch 
you don t have to apologize to anybody 
including me 
i know it s not fair of me
to hold you to things
you said in the games 
you saved us  i know that 
but i can t go on acting for the cameras 
and then just ignoring
each other in real life 
so if you can stop looking
at me like i m wounded 
then i can quit acting like it 
and then maybe we have
a shot at being friends 
i ve never been very good at friends 
for starters  it does help
when you know the person 
i hardly know anything about you
except that you re stubborn
and good with a bow 
that about sums me up 
no  there s more than that 
you just don t want to tell me 
it s like i said  i m   
see  katniss  the way
the whole friend thing works is you have to
tell each other the deep stuff 
  the deep stuff 
  yeah 
uh oh  like what 
like  uh   
what s your favorite color 
well  now you ve stepped over the line 
 chuckles 
seriously  though  what is it 
green 
what s yours 
orange 
like effie s hair 
no 
 chuckles  not that orange 
more  uh    more like a
sunset kind of orange 
 electricity crackling 
did you see that 
what 
whoa 
 scoffs  well  i never 
this is not very festive 
the mayor will make
some introductory remarks 
and then you just have to say a few words 
it s customary  of course 
to give a brief eulogy
to the district s fallen tributes 
for 11  that s thresh and rue 
here are the speeches 
i can do the talking if you want 
thank you 
mayor  ladies and gentlemen 
the victors of the 74th hunger games 
katniss everdeen and peeta mellark 
effie  smile  smile  smile  smile 
stand up straight  you re on camera 
 mild applause 
 indistinct chattering on radio 
thank you 
we re honored to be here with you today 
and to be with the families
of your fallen tributes 
effie   gasps  he put down the cards 
peeta  though they fought   
 shushes 
     and lived with honor   
  why do i bother 
   and dignity until the end 
both thresh and rue
were so young 
but our lives aren t
just measured in years 
they re measured in the lives
of people we touch around us 
for myself 
for katniss 
we know that without
rue and without thresh 
we wouldn t be standing here today 
so in recognition of that 
knowing that it in no way
can make up for your loss 
we d like to donate
one month of our winnings
to the families of the
tributes  every year 
for the rest of our lives 
 applause  oh  shit 
 stutters  can he do that 
he can t  but he did 
 sighs  why doesn t
he just stick to the cards 
peeta  thank you 
i just wanted to say that
i didn t know thresh 
i only spoke to him once 
he could have killed me 
but instead he showed me mercy 
that s a debt i ll never be able to repay 
i did know rue 
she wasn t just my ally  she was my friend 
i see her in the flowers
that grow in the meadow by my house 
i hear her in a mockingjay song 
i see her in my sister prim 
she was too young 
too gentle 
 sniffling 
and i couldn t save her 
i m sorry 
 man whistles tune 
 crowd gasps 
 clamoring 
katniss  no  no

you two have a very simple task 
i never meant for anyone to get killed 
he has to know that 
what are you talking about 
who has to know what 
snow  he came to see me 
he s worried about rebellion
in the districts 
he thinks that they don t
believe our love story 
haymitch  so he wants
you to make them believe it 
  to calm things down 
peeta    you know  katniss 
you shoulda told me
that before i went out there 
and tried to give these people the money 
i m sorry  i didn t know what to do 
he threatened to kill my family 
well  i have family  too 
okay  people that i need to protect 
what about them  who protects them 
katniss  what were you thinking 
i was thinking about rue 
haymitch  please   
please  just help me get through this trip 
please  just help us get through this 
this trip  girl  wake up 
 snaps fingers 
this trip doesn t end
when you get back home 
you never get off this train 
you two are mentors now 
that means that every year 
they re gonna drag you out 
and broadcast the details of your romance 
every year  your private
life becomes theirs 
from now on  your job
is to be a distraction 
so people forget what
the real problems are 
  so what do we do 
haymitch    you re gonna smile 
you re gonna read the cards
that effie gives you 
and you re gonna live happily ever after 
think you can do that 
huh 
yeah 
come here 
you re gonna be okay  i promise 
peeta  katniss and i want
to share with you our victory 
and our gratitude to the capitol
for bringing us together 
it was the bond of love 
forged in the crucible of the games
that was our greatest prize 
for it is love and true love
that allows us all to bear our hardships 
that mends the heart
and banishes loneliness and
gives meaning to our lives 
katniss  we also want to share with you
the sorrows of your losses 
the tributes of this   
the tributes of this district
were brave and noble warriors 
they brought honor to their families
and pride to their people 
we are all of us united 
both victors and vanquished 
in serving a common purpose 
 cheering and applause 
thank you 
one day  i m gonna volunteer 
just like you did 
 screaming 
 gasping 
it was just a dream  i m sorry

goodnight 
peeta 
will you stay with me

katniss  we are all of us united 
both victors and vanquished 
in serving a common purpose 
the power and glory
  of the capitol 
man    put down the cards

panem today  panem tomorrow 
panem forever 
 crowd clamoring 
your hair looks lovely  darling 
when did you start wearing it like that 
everyone at school wears it
like this now  grandpa 
snow is watching us 
if he wants you to pacify the districts 
i promise you  he s not happy 
instead of being in love 
you two sound like you re reciting
from a drilling manual 
you try reading that stuff
that effie writes us 
tell that to president snow
when you see him two days from now 
i m open to suggestions 
we could get married 
that s not helping 
i m serious 
if  like you said  we re
on this train forever 
it s gonna happen eventually 
why not now 
 chuckles 
it does make a statement 
i ll give you that 
yeah  sure  let s do it 
caesar  just when you thought
things couldn t get more exciting
going into a very special quarter quell 
our two lethal lovers   
my favorite expression 
 laughing 
 audience laughs 
   from district 12
have surprised us
with a new twist in their love affair 
let s take a look 
audience  aw   
 applause 
a fairy tale ending
for two star crossed lovers 
that s beautiful  beautiful 
and then tonight 
the tour that began
in the hollows of district 12
will end where 
the presidential palace 
the party of the year 
eyes bright  chins up  smiles on 
i m talking to you  katniss 
now  there ll be photographers  interviews 
everyone will be here to celebrate you 
my victors 
 sighs 
breathe it all in  children 
this is all for you 
it s cozy 
attitude 
 exhales 
come  come 
 all cheering 
come along 
excuse us  excuse us 
come  come 
hold hands 
and the library  all mahogany 
hello  hello 
not yet  not yet  no  no  no 
 giggles 
ooh  curtains 
everybody who s anybody is here 
and they all want to meet you 
flavius  octavia 
 regal music playing 
try one of these  they are divine 
no  i can t eat another thing 
  here 
peeta    what s this 
flavius  it s for when you re full 
it makes you sick 
so you can go on eating 
how else could you taste everything 
i think it s time for a dance 
katniss 
 waltz playing 
people are starving in 12 
here  they re just throwing
it up to stuff more in 
katniss  peeta 
this is plutarch heavensbee 
head gamemaker 
successor to seneca crane 
that s a tough act to follow 
peeta 
 both laugh 
may i 
please 
so how do you like the party 
it s a little overwhelming 
it s appalling 
still  if you abandon your moral judgment 
it can be fun 
so are you having fun 
i m the head gamemaker  fun is my job 
thought that was what happened
to seneca crane  too much fun 
seneca decided to quit breathing 
decided 
it was that or poison berries 
being head gamemaker has never been
the most secure job in the world 
then why are you here 
same reason as you  i volunteered 
why 
ambition 
the chance to make the games
mean something 
the games don t mean anything 
they only mean to scare us 
well  maybe it was you
who inspired me to come back 
 orchestral music playing 
 guests cheering  ah 
the presidential welcome 
i m sure we ll meet again 
katniss  come  the president awaits 
you think we convinced him 
i m not sure what else we can do 
 crowd cheering 
tonight 
on this  the last day of their tour 
i want to welcome our two victors 
two young people who embody our ideals
of strength and valor 
and i  personally  want
to congratulate them
on the announcement of their engagement 
 all cheering 
your love has inspired us 
and i know it will go on inspiring us
every day
for as long as you may live 
 crowd cheering 
 explosions 
 people clamoring on monitor 
snow  look at them 
she s not who they think she is 
she s not a leader 
she just wants to save her own skin 
it s as simple as that 
i think that s true 
but she s become
a beacon of hope for the rebellion 
and she has to be eliminated 
i agree she should die 
but in the right way 
at the right time 
it s moves and countermoves 
and it s all we gotta look at 
katniss everdeen is a symbol 
their mockingjay 
they think she s one of them 
we need to show that she s one of us 
we don t need to destroy her 
just the image 
then we let the people do the rest 
what do you propose 
shut down the black markets 
take away what little they have 
then double the amount
of floggings and executions 
put them on tv  broadcast them live 
sow fear  more fear 
it won t work  fear does not
work as long as they have hope 
and katniss everdeen is giving them hope 
she s engaged 
make everything about that 
what kinda dress is she gonna wear 
floggings 
what s the cake gonna look like 
executions 
who s gonna be there  fear 
blanket coverage  shove it in their faces 
show them that she is one of us now 
 chuckles  they re gonna hate her so much 
they might just kill her for you
brilliant 
when did you   
we need to talk 
 sighs 
where are we gonna run away 
into the woods  like we
always talked about 
if we leave right now 
we can be far away from here by tonight 
yeah  who s  we  
you  me and your fiancé 
it s not just me and peeta any more 
snow threatened to have you killed 
anyone else 
well  he didn t exactly
give me a copy of the list
but a good guess 
it includes both of our families 
unless what  you and peeta get married 
unless nothing now 
gale  we can do it 
you said yourself that we could do
it the morning of the reaping 
 sighs 
what do you say now 
do you love me 
gale  you know how i feel about you 
but i can t think about
anyone that way right now 
the only thing that i can think about
every day  every waking moment
since the reaping  is how afraid i am 
there s no room for anything else 
but maybe  if we got away from here 
if we went somewhere safe 
it could be different 
i could be different 
you think maybe the president s bluffing 
he s not bluffing 
not with what s going on in the districts 
what do you mean 
what did you see 
there were people fighting
in the streets  and fires 
and peacekeepers were gunning them down 
but the people were   
what  the people were what 
they were fighting back 
it s happening 
it s finally happening 
i should ve just eaten
the berries in the arena
and died like i was supposed to 
then everything would be back
to normal and everyone would be safe 
safe for what 
to starve  work like slaves 
send their kids to the reaping 
you haven t hurt people  katniss 
you ve given them an opportunity 
they just have to be
brave enough to take it 
there s already talk in the mines 
people wanna fight 
we have to go  gale  before they kill us 
they will kill us 
what about the other families  huh 
the ones who stay  what happens to them 
people are looking to you  katniss 
i don t want anyone looking to me 
i can t help them 
 vehicles approaching 
you do what you want 
i m staying here

plutarch  the broadcast cut out here 
before any of the excitement happened 
how many people saw it 
hard to say  there was a five second delay 
but it happened fast 
if you cannot contain katniss everdeen 
then i will have to terminate her 
i understand that 
and not just her 
her entire species has to be eliminated 
her species  sir 
the other victors 
now  because of her 
they all pose a threat 
because of her 
they all think they re invincible 
whatever game you think you re playing 
those out there are not
playing it with you 
there s a way we can still win 
it s what we gamemakers
like to call  a wrinkle  
 crowd cheering 
ladies and gentlemen 
this is the 75th year of the hunger games 
and it was written in the
charter of the games
that every 25 years 
there would be a quarter quell
to keep fresh for each new generation
the memory of those who died
in the uprising against the capitol 
each quarter quell is distinguished
by games of a special significance 
and now on this 
the 75th anniversary of our
defeat of the rebellion 
we celebrate the 3rd quarter quell
 crowd cheering 
as a reminder that even the strongest
cannot overcome the power of the capitol 
on this  the 3rd quarter quell games 
the male and female tributes
are to be reaped
from the existing pool
of victors in each district 
 audience clamoring 
mrs  everdeen  no 
who does he mean 
snow  victors shall present
themselves on reaping day
  regardless of age   
prim    katniss   
 mrs  everdeen sobbing 
   state of health
or situation

 panting 
no 
peeta 
 bottles clinking 
ah  there she is

and you ve come to  what

what s it say that peeta
was here 45 minutes ago
begging to save your life
and you only just now show up 
it means we have to save him 
you could live 100 lifetimes
and never deserve that boy 
come on  haymitch 
nobody decent ever wins the games 
nobody ever wins the games  period 
there are survivors 
there s no winners 
peeta has to survive 
we have to do whatever
it takes to save him 
 sighs 
all right  if   
if they call his name 
i ll volunteer in his place 
haymitch  thank you 
but they call my name and peeta volunteers 
there s nothing i can do 
you can help him in the arena 
like you did for me 
ah   
i think these games are gonna be different 
i don t care  do whatever you can 
peeta lives  not me 
promise me 
okay 
 softly  we should ve gone when you said 
effie  welcome 
welcome 
as we celebrate the 75th anniversary
and 3rd quarter quell
of the hunger games 
as always 
ladies first 
the female tribute from district 12 
katniss everdeen

 clears throat 
and now for the men 
the male tribute from district 12 
 sighs  haymitch abernathy 
i volunteer as tribute 
i can t let you do that 
you can t stop me 
  peeta 
  let go 
very well 
the tributes from district 12 
katniss everdeen
and peeta mellark 
well  all that remains is

katniss 
  i get to say goodbye 
  katniss 
new plan  straight to the train 
no  i have to say goodbye 
katniss 
no

effie  all right 
 clears throat 
before we begin  i ve had a thought 
you don t say 
katniss has her gold mockingjay pin 
i have my hair 
i m going to get you two boys
something gold 
uh    why is that 
a token 
show them we are a team 
and they can t just   
thank you 
all right  now   
 exhales 
everything will be different 
because it s a quarter quell 
the capitol has spared no expense 
a new training center 
new tribute living quarters 
and of course  a very special arena 
but this year you ll be
facing other victors 
capitol favorites 
smart  cunning  skilled 
and they all know one another 
you two are the outsiders 
i want you guys to forget
everything you think you know
about the games 
last year was child s play 
this year  you re dealing
with all experienced killers 
all right  what does that mean for us 
that means you re gonna have
to have some allies 
okay  i think that if   
whoop  you re not the problem 
no 
look  you re starting at a disadvantage 
most of these people
have been friends for years 
that just puts us higher
on their kill list 
do it your own way  but
i know these people 
you go it alone 
their first move is gonna
be to hunt you down 
both of you 
katniss  come on 
how could any of us even trust each other 
it s not about trust 
it s about staying alive 
cashmere and gloss 
brother and sister  district 1 
they won back to back games 
capitol favorites 
lots of sponsors  they will be lethal 
and the other half of the career pack 
brutus and enobaria 
what s with her teeth 
she had them filed into fangs
so she could rip people s throats out 
she s committed  i ll give her that 
wiress and beetee  not
fighters  but brilliant 
and weird  real tech savvy 
he won his games by electrocuting
six tributes at once 
the morphlings  masters of camouflage 
basically  won their games by
hiding until everyone else was dead 
self medicating ever since 
which i applaud 
not a threat 
finnick odair  right 
yes  he won his games at 14  youngest ever 
  extremely humble 
  you re kidding 
yes  i m kidding  he s a peacock 
a total preener 
but he s the capitol darling 
they love him here 
charming  smart 
and very skilled at combat 
especially in water 
what about weaknesses 
one  mags 
she volunteered for annie 
mags was his mentor
and basically raised him 
if he s trying to protect her in any way 
it exposes him 
a guy like that has to know
she s not gonna make it 
i bet when it really comes down to it 
he won t protect her 
well  katniss  i just hope when
she goes  she goes quickly 
she s actually a wonderful lady 
 crowd cheering in distance 
how d we get here  huh 
finnick  katniss 
hello  finnick 
do you want a sugar cube 
i mean  it s supposed to be
for the horses  but   
i mean  who cares about them  right 
they got years to eat sugar 
whereas you and i   
well  if we see something sweet 
we better grab it 
no thanks  but i would love
to borrow that outfit someday 
you look pretty terrifying in that getup 
what happened to the
pretty little girl dresses 
i outgrew them 
you certainly did 
shame about this quell thing 
now  you   
you could ve made out
like a bandit in the capitol 
jewels  money  anything you wanted 
well  i don t like jewels
and i have more money than i need  so   
what did you do
with all your wealth  anyway 
i haven t dealt in anything
as common as money in years 
then how do people pay for
the pleasure of your company 
with secrets 
what about you  girl on fire 
any secrets worth my time 
i m an open book 
everybody always seems to know my secrets
before i know them myself 
unfortunately  i think that s true 
i m sorry you had to cancel your wedding 
i know how devastating
that must be for you 
have a good day 
 snickers 
  peeta 
  finnick

 chuckles

male announcer   over pa

 grunting 
 grunting

i shot an arrow at them last year 
uh huh    electromagnetic 
how can you tell 
 both chuckling 
is it    is it obvious or something 
 continues chuckling 
 is it obvious  
they might as well have a sign 
look around you 
all the holograms  the lights 
every now and then they flicker  why 
because the force field
is taking up too much energy 
there s always a flaw in the system 
katniss  that s beautiful 
i saw you volunteer for that young girl 
it was really brave 
prim is my sister 
if you  um   
if you teach me how to make a fishhook like
that i could teach you how to hunt

beetee   
you have contributed so much
to panem over the years 
i don t know who we will miss more 
you or your brain 
 chuckles 
 audience laughs 
if the quarter quell

certainly  it can be unwritten 
yes  interesting concept 
 audience cheering  finnick   
i understand that you have a message
for somebody out there  a special somebody 
 chuckles 
can we hear it 
my love 
you have my heart
for all eternity
and if   
if i die in that arena 
my last thought will be of your lips 
we have seen a lot of tears here tonight

johanna  you are angry

and the whole idea
of revolution will be discredited 
and the idea of her 
the idea of the mockingjay 
the more allies she betrays 
the more friends she kills 
the more she reveals her true self 
as long as it ends with
her picture in the sky
and the sound of cannon

at 10 00  that big wave
hits from over there 
wiress  you re a genius

 hickory dickory dock  
 wiress continues reciting rhyme

johanna  your fiancé s right 
the whole country loves your sister 
if they tortured her or
did anything to her 
forget the districts 
there would be riots in the damn capitol 
 loudly  hey  how does that sound  snow 
what if we   
what if we set your backyard on fire 
you know  you can t put everybody in here 
what 
they can t hurt me 
there s no one left that i love 
 sighs 
i ll get you some water 
 arrows clatter 
thank you 
who s annie 
annie cresta  the girl
mags volunteered for 
she won  like  four years   
five years ago 
is she the one that went a little   
mmm hmm 
love is weird 
beetee  i have a plan 
johanna  finnick 
i have a plan 
where do the careers feel safest 
the jungle 
the jungle s a nightmare 
probably here on the beach 
then why are they not here 
because we are  we claimed it 
and if we left  they would come 
or stay hidden in the tree line 
which in just over four hours
will be soaked with water
from the 10 00 wave 
and what happens at midnight 
lightning strikes that tree 
here s what i propose 
we leave the beach at dusk 
we head to the lightning tree 
that should draw them back to the beach 
prior to midnight we then run this
wire from the tree to the water 
anyone in the water or on the damp sand
will be electrocuted 
how do we know
the wire s not gonna burn up 
because i invented it 
i assure you  it won t burn up 
well  it s better than hunting them down 
yeah  why not 
if it fails  no harm done anyway  right 
all right  i say we try it 
so what can we do to help 
keep me alive for the next six hours 
that would be extremely helpful 
 inaudible 
i think we need to go 
this plan s gonna work 
i think so  too 
and once the careers are dead 
we both know what happens next 
i don t want to be the
one that shoots first 
what if they don t either 
what if all of us refuse to shoot first 
we might still end up dead 
maybe not  i mean  it
worked for us last time 
they re not gonna make
that same mistake again 
you know and i know that there s only one
person walking out of here 
and it s gonna be one of us 
the careers are still out there 
we should stick with these
guys till midnight 
and if we hear a cannon  we go 
 inaudible 
katniss  i don t   
i don t know what kinda deals
you made with haymitch
but he made me promises  too 
if you die
and i live
i d have nothing 
nobody else that i care about 
peeta 
it s different for you 
your family needs you 
you have to live 
for them 
what about you 
nobody needs me 
i do 
i need you 
johanna  all right  lovebirds 
snow  she is preparing to fight 
that s our girl 
this is what you predicted 
moves and countermoves 
indeed 
we ll toast when it s done 
in the meantime  make yourself comfortable 
 pan em anthem playing 
 music ends 
minimal charring 
it s an impressive conductor 
let s get started 
typically a lightning strike
contains five billion joules of energy 
we don t want to be anywhere
in the vicinity when this hits 
you two girls  go together now 
take this  unspool it carefully 
make sure the entire coil is in the water 
you understand 
then head to the tree at the 2 00 sector 
we ll meet you there 
i m gonna go with them as a guard 
no  no  no  you re staying
here to protect me 
and the tree 
no  i need to go with her 
beetee  there are two careers out there 
i need two guards 
finnick can protect you
just fine on his own 
why can t finnick and johanna stay with you
and peeta and i ll take the coil 
you all agreed to keep me
alive till midnight  correct 
it s his plan  we all agreed to it 
is there a problem here 
excellent question 
no  there s no problem 
i ll see you at midnight 
johanna  all right  let s go 
come on 
i want to put as much distance
between me and this beach as possible 
frying is not how i want to go 
 wire clinking

finnick  just tell her win   
morning  sweetheart 
 grunts 
what are you doing with them 
 breathing heavily 
you and a syringe against the capitol 
see  this is why no one
lets you make the plans 
what the hell are you doing in here 
stop  stop  just listen 
we couldn t tell you with snow watching 
it was too risky 
better for you to know nothing 
 grunts 
where s peeta

you have been our mission
from the beginning 
the plan was always to get you out 
half the tributes were in on it 
this is the revolution 
and you are the mockingjay
