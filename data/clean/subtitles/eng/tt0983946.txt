welcome to fantasy island

about us online
  when you get home 
  marketing 101 
i m julia 
the personal assistant
to your host  mr  roarke 
yeah  what s his story 
i couldn t begin to tell you 
i heard roarke s family
bought this island
from the natives 200 years ago
for six cases of rum 
i heard that he was
an angel investor in the  90s
and got bored
with silicon valley 
and opened an amusement park 
trust me  the island
is so much more 
here  anything and everything
is possible 
oh  yes  unh 
you guys high five a lot 
  all the time 
  all the time  baby 
  wow 
  mr  roarke is making
final preparations 
he will meet you in the bar
for an evening drink 
in the meantime 
we will take you to your rooms 
so you may change
and freshen up 
no service 
guess not everything s possible 
gentlemen  i ll ask
you to wait at the bar 
your quarters will be
ready shortly 
and the rest of you 
please follow me 
your bungalows are this way 
  dude 
  ha 
this is    wow  i can t believe
you get to bring me 
come on  it wouldn t be
a dream vacay
without my baby bro 
right  oh 
oh 
here you go 
there s no need for money here 
mm 
wow  is this just for me 
well  it s called
fantasy island for a reason 
a place where anything
and everything is
possible  you said 
what you didn t say is how 
mr  roarke tailors each fantasy
specifically to the guest 
based on
a one page questionnaire 
i will confess 
i m relatively new here 
so how mr  roarke does
what he does
is as much a mystery to me
as it is to you 
what i do know   
is that your life is about
to change forever 
i hope you re ready 
  here you are 
  i will take two of those 
  thank you 
  oh  great  i need a drink 
mm  sorry  i m double fisting 
mm  uh  can we talk
to mr  roarke  please 
we still don t have our rooms 
sir  hello 
hey  my brother s talking
to you 
  i m his brother  hello 
  wait 
you guys are actually brothers 
oh  you think because
we re different colors
  we can t be brothers 
  wow 
  dude  racist much 
  no  i mean   
  what s up 
  what do you mean 
  come on 
  you don t like asians 
  why do you hate asians 
  that s not what i said 
verbatim what you said 
you got a racist haircut 
  look at his face 
  i m just joking  man  no 
my dad married his mom
when this little dude
was still in pampers 
  i m jd  you can call him  t  
  dude 
  what 
  we talked about this 
  whatever 
  college nickname 
   brax  is fine 
  patrick  nice to meet you guys 
you boys can always take
patrick s bungalow
and he can  bungalow  with me 
i m melanie  i don t think
we had a chance to meet 
  it was pretty noisy 
  i can get pretty noisy 
  damn 
  you are forward  melanie 
you have no idea  patrick 
so  what s your fantasy 
oh  that s a question
for the room 
i m curious how this all works 
i was wondering that myself 
virtual reality 
obviously 
maybe it s like larp 
live action role playing 
it s actually pretty fun 
so i ve heard 
from  like  dorks  heh 
  you saved it 
  thank you 
i bet he s right  it s gotta be
some sort
of immersive experience 
what if your fantasy involves
a person from your life 
holograms  like tupac 
  what if it s somebody who died 
  tupac 
i saw on reddit
that the guy pumps the drinks
with tons of hallucinogens 
crazy 
i promise 
the only thing in those drinks
is the finest imported rum 
good evening  i am mr  roarke 
the ambassador
to your deepest desires 
let me officially welcome you
to fantasy island 
  hey  hey 
  yeah 
thank you  mr  roarke 
we were all just discussing
  how this works exactly 
  you will know soon 
i promise 
you won t be disappointed 
the island has two rules 
there is only one fantasy
per guest 
and two  you must see
your fantasy through
to its natural conclusion 
no matter what 
  why wouldn t we 
  fantasies rarely play out
as you or i might expect 
but they always play out
exactly as they should 
not even you know
how they ll go 
only the island knows 
i am but its humble steward 
  so when does this all begin 
  after a good night s rest 
oh  my brother and i still
don t have our rooms 
i hope the  island  is ready for
a tough but fair yelp review 
that s because  gentlemen 
your fantasy begins now 
  how far is this place 
  yeah 
not really into bushwhacking 
  is that why jenni dumped you 
  too soon  t  come on 
stop with the nickname 
i m not playing 
we are very close 
you wrote on your questionnaire
your fantasy was
to have it all  no 
  yeah 
  well   
it s all yours 
hey  oh 
oh  my god 
oh  he did a backflip 
he did it 
oh  super on the nose 
roarke 
but i still love it 
ha ha ha 
  champagne  boys 
  not for me  asian glow 
roarke  don t forget what i told
you about my baby brother brax 
  told him you re gay 
  how could i 
oh  you think being gay
means all i want
is shirtless  ripped 
juicy  delicious men 
i got layers  dudes 
two layers  i got two layers 
fantasy fucking island 
if you need me 
just pick up any phone 
  enjoy your evening 
  oh  we will 
this is some good weed 
  good morning 
  aah  oh 
mr  roarke has called for you 
ms  olsen  please  sit 
thank you  mr  roarke 
i ve been helping people realize
their fantasies
for longer than i care to say 
often  they are
painfully unimaginative 
  lots of sex stuff 
  yeah 
but yours   
yours is quite abstract 
you wrote   happiness and i
aren t exactly compatible 
now  mistakes and regrets 
we re old friends 
so if i had one wish  i guess
it would be to get a do over  
is it too late
to change to sex stuff 
no  no  no  i like this 
this is a challenge 
and i accept 
oh  good 
what do you not like
about your life 
let us start with your job 
real estate 
mostly commercial 
i mean  what s to like 
relationship 
single 
  do you want children 
  i m sorry 
is this a therapy session
or a vacation 
if you re lucky  both 
i always pictured myself with   
just one little girl 
and with whom did you hope
to have this little girl 
ms  olsen   
regret    is a disease 
it has afflicted you
for too long 
and i can help you cure it 
if you let me 
  his name was allen 
  very good 
and why did it not work
with mr  allen 
bad timing  when we met 
i was kind of in a dark place 
at our one year anniversary
dinner  he proposed 
i said no 
you did not believe
allen loved you
because you do not believe
you deserve love 
if you could
do that moment over 
would you say yes 
yeah 
behind those doors   
is your fantasy 
a chance to change
the moment you regret the most 
madame 
what is that 
ms  olsen  please 
the doors 
maestro s 
down to the last detail 
  how did you    
  yes 
yes  and this is
where mr  allen proposed 
you flew him in 
  you knew 
  almost thought you stood me up 
ah 
reservation under chambers 
yes  sir 
right this way 
  allen  i m so sorry   
  for what 
well  that they dragged you
into this  i can t   
oh  god  you didn t
pay to get here  did you 
no  my cabbie was just like 
 no charge  man  it s cool  
what    
enjoy your meal 
you can drop the act now 
i don t speak to you
for five years 
and you just show up here 
looking   
great  by the way 
you haven t aged a day 
i saw you in my bed
this morning 
is this an intervention 
you role play with me and
i learn something about myself 
okay  when and where
did you bump your head today 
seriously  you okay 
will you excuse me 
this is not what i wanted 
this is your second chance
to say yes
  to his marriage proposal 
  but what is the point 
it doesn t change anything 
you are here because
regret has ruined your life 
do not make this another moment
you will regret 
but   
   it s not real 
  is it 
  this is fantasy island 
it s as real as you make it 
guess they re saving
the best for last 
your fantasy hasn t
started either 
  no  mind if i join you 
  please 
this guy s been
giving me nothing 
  would you like a cocktail  sir 
  oh  no  thanks 
  you nervous 
  a little 
well  i d ask you
about your fantasy again 
but you didn t really want to
talk about it last night  so   
this is gonna sound stupid 
ever since i was a kid 
i wanted to enlist 
but my mom made me promise that
i wouldn t  so i became a cop 
figured i d do some good 
see some action 
  but you didn t 
  no  there was an incident 
got stuck behind a desk 
when this came around 
i figured 
 this is my chance
to play soldier  
even if it s just actors
with blanks and   
never enlisted 
what s up with the dog tags 
uh  for luck 
well  if you re worried
your fantasy sounds stupid 
just wait
until you hear mine 
  revenge on a childhood bully 
  you got bullied 
i was a very late bloomer 
built like a small boy 
so when the most popular girl
in school decided
to make me her favorite target 
i didn t take it well 
i m not sure how you should take
a bucket of toilet water
on your head
at the eighth grade dance 
  that s terrible 
  i was having a lot of anxiety 
so my mom forced me
to go see this shrink 
aka dr  torture 
sometimes he talked so much 
i wanted to staple his mouth
shut  anyway  dr  torture 
he told me to write letters
to classmates
that i wanted to connect with 
it was  like  an exercise 
and one day  sloane 
my tormentor  stole the letters
and then plastered them
all over the cafeteria 
yeah  i was branded
 psycho stalker freak  for life 
i just want to feel what it s
like to be on the other end 
i mean  obviously 
the fantasy won t be real 
but that s why
we go to horror movies
and ride roller coasters  right 
to feel something 
i d like to
think that this is   
more exciting
than riding a roller coaster 
mr  sullivan  do you mind
giving us some privacy 
i need to give
ms  cole instructions 
in the meantime  feel free
to do push ups or crunches 
  squats  maybe 
  no  it s okay 
he knows about sloane 
i m owning it 
ah  okay  no exercise 
in the lobby   
there is an elevator 
inside  push the button
for the floor with no name 
can i record it with my phone 
  so i can remember it 
  it is your fantasy

was to see you again 
somehow the island knew

  you died saving your men
on a classified mission

it s the island 
the island has 
uh  great powers 
i first heard of its legend
many  many years ago 
a place where anything
is possible  i was obsessed 
i convinced my wife
to help me find it 
our journey was long
and hard  and   
she died before we  uh   
before we arrived 
when i finally discovered
this place 
i wished for her to live again 
to return just as i met her 
forever 
it brought her back to    
  to life 
  yes 
as long as i stay here and i
orchestrate all the fantasies   
she lives 
the island
has granted your wish too 
to have the family
you ve always wanted 
  a life you always dreamt of 
  more sand on the side 
  that s perfect 
  i suggest you start living it 
mommy  come play

yourself on it to save your men 
you were a hero 
you were my hero

  what the hell was that 
  what the hell was what 
sea snakes 
they re attracted to movement 
just don t  you know 
freak out 
wade through dirty water
in a dark cave
filled with sea snakes
without freaking out 
super easy 
what s wrong 
i    i   
nothing  nothing 
never mind 
it s just up here 
i forgive you 
what am i looking at 
your deepest desire 
this is why i brought you here 
so you can see for yourselves 
your fantasy would be to get
back together with your husband 
what the hell is this place 
that s what i was hired
to find out 
i m a pi  client offered me
a big old payday
to figure out
what happens here and how 
wants the power of the island
for himself 
i booked a stay
three weeks back 
was skeptical at first 
but then my fantasy started 
i saw my daughter 
who i d lost years ago 
it was beautiful 
but then it got all twisted 
became a nightmare 
roarke found my sat phone
and destroyed it
before i was able
to call for help 
he knew    everything 
this place is evil 
roarke is evil  huh 
doesn t care who lives or dies 
but i know how to stop him 
oh  yeah  i do 
island s power comes
from this here rock thing 
turns the water black 
dripping everywhere 
it can do impossible things 
bring a loved one back to life 
turn them into a black eyed
zombie  like it did my daughter 
i m not sure how roarke does it 
but he uses the water
to grant fantasies 
i m gonna use it
to expose him as a monster 
which is why i need you
to smuggle this off the island 
i know a private pilot 
hour away 
find a phone in the hotel 
call him at this number 
get off this island
with the canteen 
  tell the world about this place 
  what about you 
roarke won t let me
near the hotel 
but as far as he s concerned 
you re just a guest 
  a guest 
  what 
no  i m not 
yeah  i saw you
get off the plane 
you got here on a plane 
no 
what 
he is crazy 
i saved you  remember 
your fantasy
was to ruin my life 
and who are all those people 
oh  my god 
you re the psycho stalker girl 
you did all of this
because of a couple of pranks 
pranks 
you tortured me
every single day for years 
oh  please 
i teased you a little 
i was so traumatized
by what you did 
i had to finish high school
from home

was wrong

she looks better than tupac 
you recorded this 
i fantasized about
getting revenge for years 
can you blame me
for wanting to document it 
i thought you were
a hologram 
and here is the proof
that i saved you 
see  i used the taser thing
and the water to take him down 
you want a prize
for not letting me die 
i know asking
for all of this was crazy 
but  please 
you have to believe me 
i thought it was fake 
how did you figure out
it was actually me 
when your real husband answered
the phone  i    wait 
  i don t think i can do this 
  you have to 
  what do you want  sloane 
  will  please don t hang up 
uh  i need your help 
i ve been kidnapped 
i ve been taken
to some island somewhere 
oh  cut the bullshit 
please  i am telling you
the truth 
why should i believe you 
you probably shouldn t 
not after what i did to you 
we used to be happy  will 
and then   
i don t know 
i m not trying to make excuses 
but i felt you pulling away from
me  so i wanted to hurt you 
it s what i ve done
my whole life  i   
i hurt people
who don t deserve it 
and i am so sorry 
there is no defending
the way that i treated you 
and i ll understand
if you can never forgive me 
do you think
this fixes anything 
not even close 
okay  um   
what do you need me to do 
i have a phone number 
i need you to call it
and tell them
that damon needs the plane 
damon  do i even wanna know 
no  it s not what you think 
i ll explain everything
when i get home 
will   
thank you 
come on  gwen  please breathe 
breathe  breathe 
please 
oh  good girl 
what are you    
what are you doing here 
you got your fantasy redo 
did it work  did you save him 
no 
i think this is
someone else s fantasy 
where are the others 
okay 
damon s pilot
should be here any minute 
grab one 
okay 
  whatever comes out of there   
  we ll deal with it 
together 
patrick  brax 
what     how did you find us 
we re looking for roarke 
who are you 
i m her fantasy 
not like that 
where s jd 
  he didn t make it 
  we have to get off this island 
let me grab the map 
a plane is on its way  come on 
head for the dock 
  head for the dock  let s go 
  go 
back  back  back 
hello  my friends 
  roarke  you son of a bitch 
  i warned you 
fantasies rarely play out
as you would expect 
play out  my brother s dead 
i could not save him 
just like mr  sullivan
  couldn t save his father 
  ah 
the staff will do anything
to protect me 
the island gives them
a taste of their fantasies 
they give me their loyalty 
and who are you loyal to 
do they know 
know what 
we weren t brought here
to have our own fantasy 
we were brought here to be
part of someone else s 
  because of nick taylor 
  who s nick taylor 
he was our roommate 
  he died  six years ago 
  in a fire that i started 
i had just moved
into the building 
i put a kettle on for tea 
and i forgot to turn
the burner off when i left 
my fantasy took me back there 
i saw you and jd 
jd wanted to check
on nick s room 
but i thought he was out with
a girl  so    i made jd run 
you were there 
you did nothing 
  i didn t see you 
  nick was in one of my classes 
he asked me out 
but i couldn t believe
that someone was
actually interested in me 
i was supposed to see him later
that night  but i got cold feet 
he shouldn t have been home 
he should ve been with me 
everyone who got off that plane
has a hand in nick s death 
so this is
one big revenge fantasy 
correct 
so how does this end 
with your deaths 
your lives for nick s 
if that s
what the island demands 
  call it off 
  you know i do not have a choice 
  the plane 
  get them out of here 
come on 
someone has found his courage 
the plane  the plane 
  there it is  hey 
  hey 
  hey  over there 
  hey 
  hey 
  oh  my god  we re going home 
who are you protecting 
where are the others 
stop 
she wants them all together 
  oh  my god 
  what the    
  no  no 
  who is that 
guys 
  come on  let s go 
  go  run 
shit 
we re safe here for   
for a minute 
okay  not to be negative 
but we re gonna die here 
  we re not throwing in the towel 
  she s right 
  everyone else works for roarke 
  unless they don t 
julia  she pulled me
from the fire 
she saved my life 
roarke s servants wouldn t
interfere in a fantasy 
maybe she s not his assistant 
maybe she is a guest 
she did say she
just started there 
she could be nick s mom 
he always told me
how controlling she was 
and julia s eyes 
they look a lot like nick s 
i saw her coughing up blood 
this could be her dying wish 
okay  but then why would
she save you from the fire 
so gwen could tell us
why we re here 
it s not really
a satisfying revenge
  if your victims are oblivious 
  so we go to her 
we apologize 
try to make this right 
someone that brought us
to this island to die
is probably looking for a little
more than just an apology 
if we can t stop her 
maybe we can stop the island 
yeah  there s a spring
with an ancient stone 
  it makes the fantasies possible 
  the water in the spring 
jd was right 
roarke did spike our drinks 
we destroy the spring 
then we end the fantasies 
  it s worth a shot 
  how do we do that 
with this 
anything else we should know 
it s a maze  so stick together 
and there are sea snakes 
so don t  you know  freak out 
did she say sea snakes 
we had a guide before  and even
he almost got lost  but i m   
i m 99 percent positive
it s this way 
listen for the spring 
it sounds like dripping water 
whole island sounds like that 
i think i hear it 
gwen 
gwen 
shit 
we lost gwen and brax 
give me the grenade 
i ll find the spring 
you go find them 
no  no  it s too dangerous 
if you find the spring 
call out for me 
i ll follow your voice
and then blow it 
sloane 
just sea snakes 
melanie 
brax 
am i gonna be okay 
  we should ve never come here 
  you gotta save me  dude 
i d do it for you 
i did everything for you 
i tried 
it should ve been you instead 
mom and dad love me more 
they already wish
you were dead  guh 
  no 
  aah  ugh  aah 
jd  no  no 
omg 
what a pathetic loser 
  what are you 
  i m the real you 
  the coolest girl in school 
  no 
that s not who i am anymore 
there s no defending the way
that i treated you 
and i ll understand
if you never forgive me 
stop it  i meant that 
people never change 
they just get better
at hiding who they are 
this isn t real 
you are not real 
i will never be you again 
mommy  come see 
lila  what are you doing 
i killed daddy 
  oh  god  why 
  because you don t deserve him 
you don t deserve me 
you don t deserve anything good
after what you did 
  oh  lila   
  my friend was right 
you ruin everything 
friend 
  hi  gwen 
  oh   
oh  god  nick 
please  i m so sorry 
 sorry 
won t bring me back  gwen 
 sorry  won t keep me
from gagging on the smoke 
from burning alive 
do you know
what that feels like 
you re not him 
please  nick 
you said it yourself 
none of this
is gonna bring you back 
i m not the one doing this 
i know who is 
and she can have me 
just let the others go 
do you hear me  julia  
who s julia 
melanie 
patrick 
patrick  gwen 
  are you okay 
  i heard screaming 
i just saw nick 
this is not julia s fantasy 
  then whose is it 
  it s not patrick s 
guy just can t seem
to save anybody 
not even himself 
as soon as i saw
this place  i   
i knew i had to bring
everyone here where there s   
no escape from my fantasy 
  your fantasy 
  yes  the one i asked for
before any of you had
even heard of fantasy island 
when i first met nick  it was
like i d known him for years 
and we got coffee  and we ended
up talking the entire night 
and i wasn t worried
about saying something stupid
or trying to be cool
because he made me feel
comfortable in my own skin 
we made plans to see
each other again that night 
it would ve been
our first real date 
i wanted to look super pretty 
so i bought a new dress 
i got this necklace 
i got to our meeting place 
and i waited 
hour passed  then two 
but no nick 
i started to think   sloane
was right  i am worthless 
no one could ever possibly
love me 
and nick must have realized
that too 
why else would he be
doing this to me  
i stayed there all night 
torturing myself 
and when i got home 
i read about the fire 
and my heart shattered 
i was this close
to my real life fantasy 
but all of you 
you turned it into a nightmare 
you could ve had anything
you wanted here 
  you could ve had nick back 
  it would ve been fake 
our future was stolen 
and all of you  you just
moved on with your lives 
nick deserves better 
nick deserves justice 
melanie 
don t you mean
 psycho stalker freak  
there is hate in my heart 
and it grows every day 
you put it there  this is
as much your fault as theirs 
  but you saved me 
  that was an act 
  why 
  so you could see my worth 
your very life on this island 
it depended on me 
i wouldn t do that 
really 
you thought i needed you 
i was using you
to get off this island 
  shut up 
  i didn t think it was possible 
you re actually more pathetic
now than you ever were then 
shut up 
go  go 
holy shit  she went out
with him one time 
i can hear it  the spring 
hey 
come on 
what are you waiting for  do it 
it s reflecting her fantasy 
please do not do that 
ms  olsen 
julia is your fantasy 
  my wife 
  she said she just started here 
she believes that  yes 
you see  my wish
was to have her back 
just as i met her  forever 
so she appears not knowing me 
and soon  she takes ill 
just as she did before 
that plays out
again and again 
courting her became too painful 
so i lie to her 
i tell her she s my assistant 
when melanie requested
her fantasy 
i had no choice but to oblige 
  you can stop her  roarke 
  no  he can t 
he s the genie 
and this island is his bottle 
trapped forever 
and if he doesn t give
every guest their fantasy 
he loses his love 
you think that s love 
letting julia die over and over
again forever  that s hell 
she was your wife  roarke 
she s not anymore 
she s not even your assistant 
she s your prisoner 
you have to let her go 
  i cannot 
  no 
no 
i m sorry  the fantasy must
reach its natural conclusion 
those are the rules 
the guests   
they re dying 
i m dying 
you ll be fine 
soon enough 
and the others 
if i interfere
with the island   
i lose you forever 
lose me 
you have to do something 
they re not the island s guests 
they re yours 
it s not what i want 
but it s what you have to do 
melanie  i am sorry
your life didn t work out
the way you wanted 
  mine didn t either 
  everybody s sorry
when it s time
to pay the piper  right 
i ll pay 
it was my fault  i could ve
saved nick  let the others go 
oh  my god  are you still trying
to be like dead daddy 
well  you re not a hero 
it was just your fantasy 
she s right 
it was his fantasy 
all of my guests get a fantasy 
so if you drink the water 
you get one 
sloane s fantasy 
what  that she and her husband
get to be together forever 
no 
  that you and nick do 
  huh

from exposing this island
and suing you

are a lot like dreams 
you rarely remember the details 
but you always remember
how they make you feel

that i wanna get
the hell off this island 
so  what happens

to go home  to have a life 
in order for that fantasy
to last
