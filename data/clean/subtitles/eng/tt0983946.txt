the personal assistant
to your host mr roarke
yeah whats his story
i couldnt begin to tell you
i heard roarkes family
bought this island
from the natives 200 years ago
for six cases of rum
i heard that he was
an angel investor in the 90s
and got bored
with silicon valley
and opened an amusement park
trust me the island
is so much more
here anything and everything
is possible

you guys highfive a lot

final preparations

and freshen up

a dream vacay
without my baby bro
right oh
oh
here you go
theres no need for money here
mm
wow is this just for me
well its called
fantasy island for a reason
a place where anything
and everything is
possible you said
what you didnt say is how
mr roarke tailors each fantasy
specifically to the guest
based on
a onepage questionnaire
i will confess
im relatively new here
so how mr roarke does
what he does
is as much a mystery to me
as it is to you
what i do know
is that your life is about
to change forever
i hope youre ready
here you are
i will take two of those
thank you
oh great i need a drink
mm sorry im doublefisting
mm uh can we talk
to mr roarke please
we still dont have our rooms
sir hello
hey my brothers talking
to you
im his brother hello
wait
you guys are actually brothers
oh you think because
were different colors
we cant be brothers
wow
dude racist much
no i mean
whats up
what do you mean
come on
you dont like asians
why do you hate asians
thats not what i said
verbatim what you said
you got a racist haircut
look at his face
im just joking man no
my dad married his mom
when this little dude
was still in pampers
im jd you can call him t
dude
what
we talked about this
whatever
college nickname
brax is fine
patrick nice to meet you guys
you boys can always take
patricks bungalow
and he can bungalow with me
im melanie i dont think
we had a chance to meet
it was pretty noisy
i can get pretty noisy
damn
you are forward melanie
you have no idea patrick
so whats your fantasy
oh thats a question
for the room
im curious how this all works
i was wondering that myself
virtual reality
obviously
maybe its like larp
liveaction roleplaying
its actually pretty fun
so ive heard
from like dorks heh
you saved it
thank you
i bet hes right its gotta be
some sort
of immersive experience
what if your fantasy involves
a person from your life
holograms like tupac
what if its somebody who died
tupac
i saw on reddit
that the guy pumps the drinks
with tons of hallucinogens
crazy
i promise
the only thing in those drinks
is the finest imported rum
good evening i am mr roarke
the ambassador
to your deepest desires
let me officially welcome you
to fantasy island
hey hey
yeah
thank you mr roarke
we were all just discussing
how this works exactly
you will know soon
i promise
you wont be disappointed
the island has two rules
there is only one fantasy
per guest
and two you must see
your fantasy through
to its natural conclusion
no matter what
why wouldnt we
fantasies rarely play out
as you or i might expect
but they always play out
exactly as they should
not even you know
how theyll go
only the island knows
i am but its humble steward
so when does this all begin
after a good nights rest
oh my brother and i still
dont have our rooms
i hope the island is ready for
a tough but fair yelp review
thats because gentlemen
your fantasy begins now
how far is this place
yeah
not really into bushwhacking
is that why jenni dumped you
too soon t come on
stop with the nickname
im not playing
we are very close
you wrote on your questionnaire
your fantasy was
to have it all no
yeah
well
its all yours
hey oh
oh my god
oh he did a backflip
he did it
oh super onthenose
roarke
but i still love it
hahaha
champagne boys
not for me asian glow
roarke dont forget what i told
you about my baby brother brax
told him youre gay
how could i
oh you think being gay
means all i want
is shirtless ripped
juicy delicious men
i got layers dudes
two layers i got two layers
fantasy fucking island
if you need me
just pick up any phone
enjoy your evening
oh we will
this is some good weed
good morning
aah oh
mr roarke has called for you
ms olsen please sit
thank you mr roarke
ive been helping people realize
their fantasies
for longer than i care to say
often they are
painfully unimaginative
lots of sex stuff
yeah
but yours
yours is quite abstract
you wrote happiness and i
arent exactly compatible
now mistakes and regrets
were old friends
so if i had one wish i guess
it would be to get a doover
is it too late
to change to sex stuff
no no no i like this
this is a challenge
and i accept
oh good
what do you not like
about your life
let us start with your job
real estate
mostly commercial
i mean whats to like
relationship
single
do you want children
im sorry
is this a therapy session
or a vacation
if youre lucky both
i always pictured myself with
just one little girl
and with whom did you hope
to have this little girl
ms olsen
regret is a disease
it has afflicted you
for too long
and i can help you cure it
if you let me
his name was allen
very good
and why did it not work
with mr allen
bad timing when we met
i was kind of in a dark place
at our oneyear anniversary
dinner he proposed
i said no
you did not believe
allen loved you
because you do not believe
you deserve love
if you could
do that moment over
would you say yes
yeah
behind those doors
is your fantasy
a chance to change
the moment you regret the most
madame
what is that
ms olsen please
the doors
maestros
down to the last detail
how did you
yes
yes and this is
where mr allen proposed
you flew him in
you knew
almost thought you stood me up
ah
reservation under chambers
yes sir
right this way
allen im so sorry
for what
well that they dragged you
into this i cant
oh god you didnt
pay to get here did you
no my cabbie was just like
no charge man its cool
what
enjoy your meal
you can drop the act now
i dont speak to you
for five years
and you just show up here
looking
great by the way
you havent aged a day
i saw you in my bed
this morning
is this an intervention
you roleplay with me and
i learn something about myself
okay when and where
did you bump your head today
seriously you okay
will you excuse me
this is not what i wanted
this is your second chance
to say yes
to his marriage proposal
but what is the point
it doesnt change anything
you are here because
regret has ruined your life
do not make this another moment
you will regret
but
its not real
is it
this is fantasy island
its as real as you make it
guess theyre saving
the best for last
your fantasy hasnt
started either
no mind if i join you
please
this guys been
giving me nothing
would you like a cocktail sir
oh no thanks
you nervous
a little
well id ask you
about your fantasy again
but you didnt really want to
talk about it last night so
this is gonna sound stupid
ever since i was a kid
i wanted to enlist
but my mom made me promise that
i wouldnt so i became a cop
figured id do some good
see some action
but you didnt
no there was an incident
got stuck behind a desk
when this came around
i figured
this is my chance
to play soldier
even if its just actors
with blanks and
never enlisted
whats up with the dog tags
uh for luck
well if youre worried
your fantasy sounds stupid
just wait
until you hear mine
revenge on a childhood bully
you got bullied
i was a very late bloomer
built like a small boy
so when the most popular girl
in school decided
to make me her favorite target
i didnt take it well
im not sure how you should take
a bucket of toilet water
on your head
at the eighthgrade dance
thats terrible
i was having a lot of anxiety
so my mom forced me
to go see this shrink
aka dr torture
sometimes he talked so much
i wanted to staple his mouth
shut anyway dr torture
he told me to write letters
to classmates
that i wanted to connect with
it was like an exercise
and one day sloane
my tormentor stole the letters
and then plastered them
all over the cafeteria
yeah i was branded
psycho stalker freak for life
i just want to feel what its
like to be on the other end
i mean obviously
the fantasy wont be real
but thats why
we go to horror movies
and ride roller coasters right
to feel something
id like to
think that this is
more exciting
than riding a roller coaster
mr sullivan do you mind
giving us some privacy
i need to give
ms cole instructions
in the meantime feel free
to do pushups or crunches
squats maybe
no its okay
he knows about sloane
im owning it
ah okay no exercise
in the lobby
there is an elevator
inside push the button
for the floor with no name

this place
i wished for her to live again
to return just as i met her
forever
it brought her back to
to life

orchestrate all the fantasies

islands power comes
from this here rock thing
turns the water black
dripping everywhere
it can do impossible things
bring a loved one back to life
turn them into a blackeyed
zombie like it did my daughter
im not sure how roarke does it
but he uses the water
to grant fantasies
im gonna use it
to expose him as a monster
which is why i need you
to smuggle this off the island
i know a private pilot
hour away
find a phone in the hotel
call him at this number
get off this island
with the canteen

can you blame me
for wanting to document it
i thought you were
a hologram
and here is the proof
that i saved you
see i used the taser thing
and the water to take him down
you want a prize
for not letting me die
i know asking

but please
you have to believe me
i thought it was fake

what do you want sloane

you probably shouldnt
not after what i did to you
we used to be happy will
and then
i dont know
im not trying to make excuses
but i felt you pulling away from
me so i wanted to hurt you
its what ive done
my whole life i
i hurt people
who dont deserve it
and i am so sorry
there is no defending
the way that i treated you
and ill understand
if you can never forgive me
do you think
this fixes anything
not even close

someone elses fantasy
where are the others

damons pilot

together
patrick brax
what how did you find us
were looking for roarke
who are you
im her fantasy
not like that
wheres jd
he didnt make it
we have to get off this island
let me grab the map
a plane is on its way come on
head for the dock
head for the dock lets go
go
back back back
hello my friends
roarke you son of a bitch
i warned you
fantasies rarely play out
as you would expect
play out my brothers dead
i could not save him
just like mr sullivan
couldnt save his father
ah
the staff will do anything
to protect me
the island gives them
a taste of their fantasies
they give me their loyalty
and who are you loyal to
do they know
know what
we werent brought here
to have our own fantasy
we were brought here to be
part of someone elses
because of nick taylor
whos nick taylor
he was our roommate
he died six years ago
in a fire that i started
i had just moved
into the building
i put a kettle on for tea
and i forgot to turn
the burner off when i left
my fantasy took me back there
i saw you and jd
jd wanted to check
on nicks room
but i thought he was out with
a girl so i made jd run
you were there
you did nothing
i didnt see you
nick was in one of my classes
he asked me out
but i couldnt believe
that someone was
actually interested in me
i was supposed to see him later
that night but i got cold feet
he shouldnt have been home
he shouldve been with me
everyone who got off that plane
has a hand in nicks death
so this is
one big revenge fantasy
correct
so how does this end
with your deaths
your lives for nicks
if thats
what the island demands
call it off
you know i do not have a choice
the plane
get them out of here
come on
someone has found his courage
the plane the plane
there it is hey
hey
hey over there
hey
hey
oh my god were going home
who are you protecting
where are the others
stop
she wants them all together
oh my god
what the
no no
who is that
guys
come on lets go
go run
shit
were safe here for
for a minute
okay not to be negative
but were gonna die here
were not throwing in the towel
shes right
everyone else works for roarke
unless they dont
julia she pulled me
from the fire
she saved my life
roarkes servants wouldnt
interfere in a fantasy
maybe shes not his assistant
maybe she is a guest
she did say she
just started there
she could be nicks mom
he always told me
how controlling she was
and julias eyes
they look a lot like nicks
i saw her coughing up blood
this could be her dying wish
okay but then why would
she save you from the fire
so gwen could tell us
why were here
its not really
a satisfying revenge
if your victims are oblivious
so we go to her
we apologize
try to make this right
someone that brought us
to this island to die
is probably looking for a little
more than just an apology
if we cant stop her
maybe we can stop the island
yeah theres a spring
with an ancient stone
it makes the fantasies possible
the water in the spring
jd was right
roarke did spike our drinks
we destroy the spring
then we end the fantasies
its worth a shot
how do we do that
with this
anything else we should know
its a maze so stick together
and there are sea snakes
so dont you know freak out
did she say sea snakes
we had a guide before and even
he almost got lost but im
im 99 percent positive
its this way
listen for the spring
it sounds like dripping water
whole island sounds like that
i think i hear it
gwen
gwen
shit
we lost gwen and brax
give me the grenade
ill find the spring
you go find them
no no its too dangerous
if you find the spring
call out for me
ill follow your voice
and then blow it
sloane
just sea snakes
melanie
brax
am i gonna be okay
we shouldve never come here
you gotta save me dude
id do it for you
i did everything for you
i tried
it shouldve been you instead
mom and dad love me more
they already wish
you were dead guh
no
aah ugh aah
jd no no
omg
what a pathetic loser
what are you
im the real you
the coolest girl in school
no
thats not who i am anymore
theres no defending the way
that i treated you
and ill understand
if you never forgive me
stop it i meant that
people never change
they just get better
at hiding who they are
this isnt real
you are not real
i will never be you again
mommy come see
lila what are you doing
i killed daddy
oh god why
because you dont deserve him
you dont deserve me
you dont deserve anything good
after what you did
oh lila
my friend was right
you ruin everything
friend
hi gwen
oh
oh god nick
please im so sorry
sorry
wont bring me back gwen
sorry wont keep me
from gagging on the smoke
from burning alive
do you know
what that feels like
youre not him
please nick
you said it yourself
none of this
is gonna bring you back
im not the one doing this
i know who is
and she can have me
just let the others go
do you hear me julia
whos julia
melanie
patrick
patrick gwen
are you okay
i heard screaming
i just saw nick
this is not julias fantasy
then whose is it
its not patricks
guy just cant seem
to save anybody
not even himself
as soon as i saw
this place i
i knew i had to bring
everyone here where theres
no escape from my fantasy
your fantasy
yes the one i asked for
before any of you had
even heard of fantasy island
when i first met nick it was
like id known him for years
and we got coffee and we ended
up talking the entire night
and i wasnt worried
about saying something stupid
or trying to be cool
because he made me feel
comfortable in my own skin
we made plans to see
each other again that night
it wouldve been
our first real date
i wanted to look super pretty
so i bought a new dress
i got this necklace
i got to our meeting place
and i waited
hour passed then two
but no nick
i started to think sloane
was right i am worthless
no one could ever possibly
love me
and nick must have realized
that too
why else would he be
doing this to me
i stayed there all night
torturing myself
and when i got home
i read about the fire
and my heart shattered
i was this close
to my reallife fantasy
but all of you
you turned it into a nightmare
you couldve had anything
you wanted here
you couldve had nick back
it wouldve been fake
our future was stolen
and all of you you just
moved on with your lives
nick deserves better
nick deserves justice
melanie
dont you mean
psycho stalker freak
there is hate in my heart
and it grows every day
you put it there this is
as much your fault as theirs
but you saved me
that was an act
why
so you could see my worth
your very life on this island
it depended on me
i wouldnt do that
really
you thought i needed you
i was using you
to get off this island
shut up
i didnt think it was possible
youre actually more pathetic
now than you ever were then
shut up
go go
holy shit she went out
with him one time
i can hear it the spring
hey
come on
what are you waiting for do it
its reflecting her fantasy
please do not do that
ms olsen
julia is your fantasy
my wife
she said she just started here
she believes that yes
you see my wish
was to have her back
just as i met her forever
so she appears not knowing me
and soon she takes ill
just as she did before
that plays out
again and again
courting her became too painful
so i lie to her
i tell her shes my assistant
when melanie requested
her fantasy
i had no choice but to oblige
you can stop her roarke
no he cant
hes the genie
and this island is his bottle
trapped forever
and if he doesnt give
every guest their fantasy
he loses his love
you think thats love
letting julia die over and over
again forever thats hell
she was your wife roarke
shes not anymore
shes not even your assistant
shes your prisoner
you have to let her go
i cannot
no
no
im sorry the fantasy must
reach its natural conclusion
those are the rules
the guests
theyre dying
im dying
youll be fine
soon enough
and the others
if i interfere
with the island
i lose you forever
lose me
you have to do something
theyre not the islands guests
theyre yours
its not what i want
but its what you have to do
melanie i am sorry
your life didnt work out
the way you wanted
mine didnt either
everybodys sorry
when its time
to pay the piper right
ill pay
it was my fault i couldve
saved nick let the others go
oh my god are you still trying
to be like dead daddy
well youre not a hero
it was just your fantasy
shes right
it was his fantasy
all of my guests get a fantasy
so if you drink the water
you get one
sloanes fantasy
what that she and her husband
get to be together forever
no
that you and nick do
huh
those are the rules
fantasy fucking island
get back
aah
hello
hello
gwen you okay
hey
guys
what happened
you saved us
wheres patrick
he died as a hero
he made his father proud
one star on yelp
so whats gonna stop us all
from exposing this island
and suing you
well fantasies mrs maddison
are a lot like dreams
you rarely remember the details
but you always remember
how they make you feel
well i just remembered
that i wanna get
the hell off this island
so what happens
to you now mr roarke
i stay here
protect this place
and live my life
without regret
technically you partook
in your brothers fantasy
so the island can grant you one
i want jd back i want him
to go home to have a life
in order for that fantasy
to last
you would need to stay here
forever
i was so horrible
to her back then
all you can do now
is forgive yourself
