hanratty 
our unknown subject
is a paperhanger
who started working
on the east coast 
ln the last few weeks 
this unsub has developed
a new form of check fraud
which l m calling  the float  
what he s doing is
he s opening checking accounts
at various banks
then changing the micr ink
routing numbers
at the bottom of those checks 
next slide  please 
  projector clanks  
next slide  please 
uh  the remote thing is broken 
you ll have to do it by hand 
you ve gotta    try the   
agent mullen  it should be   
it should be the square button
just there by the side 
this carousel doesn t work 
it s a bad carousel
you got there 
thank you  agent mullen 
got to move it manually 
this is a map of the 12 banks
of the u s  federal reserve 
slide 
  clicking  
micr scanners at every bank
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check  
slide  
and then  ship that check off
to its corresponding branch 
carl  for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud
you mind telling us
what the hell
you re talking about 
the east coast branches are
numbered zero one to zero six 
the central branch
is zero seven  zero eight
so on  so forth 
you mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check
actually mean something 
all of this was in the report
i filed two days ago 
if you change   
a zero two to a one two
that means that check 
which was cashed in new york
does not go
to the new york federal branch
but it is rerouted
all the way to the san francisco
federal branch 
the bank doesn t even know the
check has bounced for two weeks
which means our unsub can stay
in one place
paper the same city
over and over again
while his checks circle
the country 
you know 
you want to talk to my wife 
she s the one balances
the checkbook at our house

good morning 
i ve  uh  called this meeting
to discuss
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks
then passing them
throughout arizona 
  panting  
this unsub is a big dog
passing checks
as large as five figures 
  door opening  
sorry i m late 
sorry 
we have a recovered check
on agent reiter s desk 
why don t we step out
to the bullpen 
there s impressions
on every line 
looks like the original amount
was for  60 
mind if i take a look 
cashed in flagstaff a week ago 
cost the bank  16 000 
it s a real check 
yeah 
yeah  it s been washed 
the only thing original
is the signature 
but it s perfect  carl 
i mean   
i mean  this isn t hydrochloride
or bleach 
no 
something new 
maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone
removes the ink
that s not been printed 
how did you do it  frank 
how did you cheat
on the bar exam in louisiana 
i didn t cheat 
i studied for two weeks
and i passed 
is that the truth  frank 
is that the truth 
i ll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes 
he washes off their names
and he puts on his own 
you re saying that he s a local 
well  if it were me  you know
i d call the bank first 
i d check out the balance   
make sure there s enough money
in there
to make it worth your while 
exactly 
you know  carl  i think
this guy s pretty smart
