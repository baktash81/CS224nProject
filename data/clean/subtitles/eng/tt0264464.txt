hanratty
our unknown subject
is a paperhanger
who started working
on the east coast
ln the last few weeks
this unsub has developed
a new form of check fraud
which lm calling the float
what hes doing is
hes opening checking accounts
at various banks
then changing the micr ink
routing numbers
at the bottom of those checks
next slide please
projector clanks
next slide please
uh the remote thing is broken
youll have to do it by hand
youve gotta try the
agent mullen it should be
it should be the square button
just there by the side
this carousel doesnt work
its a bad carousel
you got there
thank you agent mullen
got to move it manually
this is a map of the 12 banks
of the us federal reserve
slide
clicking
micr scanners at every bank
read these numbers
at the bottom of a check
slide
and then ship that check off
to its corresponding branch
carl for those of us who are
unfamiliar with bank fraud
you mind telling us
what the hell
youre talking about
the east coast branches are
numbered zeroone to zerosix
the central branch
is zeroseven zeroeight
so on so forth
you mean those numbers
on the bottom of a check
actually mean something
all of this was in the report
i filed two days ago
if you change
a zerotwo to a onetwo
that means that check
which was cashed in new york
does not go
to the new york federal branch
but it is rerouted
all the way to the san francisco
federal branch
the bank doesnt even know the
check has bounced for two weeks
which means our unsub can stay
in one place
paper the same city
over and over again
while his checks circle
the country
you know
you want to talk to my wife
shes the one balances
the checkbook at our house
