im more of a superfun au pair
yeah
well youll have to get us tickets
i cant believe you guys are from wilkinsburg
yes
xavier was a janitor and then he bought the company
i believe the proper term is custodial attendant
thank you i appreciate that
from wilkinsburg to all this
that is very inspirational
well were very blessed
what we did is we worked hard
wilkinsburg is no place to raise a child
oh i dont know you turned out just fine diva
youre just saying that
because you see the house we live in now
you didnt see the toilets i had to clean
or the days we went hungry
it wasnt that bad
nights sitting in a chair with a broom
keeping the rats out of daryns crib
i dont remember any of that
good its because we made a plan
but sometimes bad shit just happens
i mean some stuff you cant keep away with a broom right
apparently not
you know i just love these candlesticks
are they silver
actually i believe those are pewter
so isabelle where do you go to school
shes homeschooled actually
what about college
i hadnt given it much thought yet
not everybody is destined for higher education
i actually couldnt agree more
i think the world could do with a few
less fancy degrees and a few more artists
who live in their parents basements
like half of all college grads
dessert
daryn is destined to do great things
maybe hes already doing great things
the first steps to any plan is identifying a proper goal
harvard undergraduate first
then yale law
i just got exhausted even listening to that shit
not everybody can be a superfun au pair
maybe thats enough xavier
because im his father and he is my son
dad
we have a responsibility to each other
he puts his faith in me and i protect him
from what zombies
no from you
excuse you
girls like you girls your type
dad
i am so sorry
dad
distraction that youve become in his life
dad i got waitlisted
excuse me
well thats not a no so lets remain positive
when did you find this out
a week or two ago
and youre just telling me this now
im sure he had a reason
stop coddling him
dont you see hes throwing his life away for you
how can you be this selfish
i mean theres no future here
okay enough lets go were going
i am really sorry
stand up here we go sweetheart
daryn
come here sweetheart easy
thank you for the wonderful dinner catherine

im a member of national honors society
and i have the state record in the 5000meter
and i have a
gpa of
blah blah blah
im listing a bunch of bullshit right now
heres who i am
i might suck at punching people
but i can get an entire ice cream shop going
i can eat like a person but i can also be an asshole
i know that greatness requires sacrifice hard work
and dedication but i also know that clouds are for cupids
and some things you just cant keep away with a broom
and i know that i have to be true to myself
before i can be true to her but
shes not here right now

there it is
i love you

ill see you soon
yeah
are you ready for this
i thought so
never gotten a request quite like this one before
it comes from a dying girl named isabelle
im gonna have to clean some of the language up
because my girl can curse
so isabelle writes
everybody thinks that dying
teaches you something about life
but theyre wrong
the only way to learn about life is by living
and ive learned that every moment
is your moment
sometimes the moments are messy
sometimes theyre beautiful
or scary or just plain weird
but theyre all yours
cherish them
living isnt easy
but if you can manage to look past your own fears
and everyone elses expectations
the reward is your life
and in my life
i was loved
so daryn one more
she also sent me this track and told me
i had to play it or else she would haunt me
so here is the world premiere
