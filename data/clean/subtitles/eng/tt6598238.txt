do you know how hard it is to get into harvard 
they take less than 6 percent 
less than 6 percent

  please  come on in 
  it s so nice to meet you  sir 
  please  come in 
  i got you something 
it s small and stupid  but   
thank you  it s christmas eve 
i should ve gotten something for you  and i didn t 
  and i feel terrible 
  you messed up 
  yes  i did 
  i must be rubbing off on you 
thank you 
let me get this for you 
xavier and i  we went to wilkinsburg high school 
and then we moved
into this tiny  shabby studio apartment
about two blocks away from the tap house 
that place is now the club mirella 
and shield your eyes
for you are gazing upon their headliner 
oh  no applause  please  hey  stop that 
nasty girl  i told you  no applause 
  isabelle  you must be very proud of your father 
  i don t have a father 
  i m more of a super fun au pair 
  yeah 
well  you ll have to get us tickets 
  i can t believe you guys are from wilkinsburg 
  yes 
  xavier was a janitor  and then he bought the company 
  i believe the proper term is custodial attendant 
  thank you  i appreciate that 
  from wilkinsburg to all this 
  that is very inspirational 
  well  we re very blessed 
what we did is we worked hard 
wilkinsburg is no place to raise a child 
oh  i don t know  you turned out just fine  diva 
you re just saying that
because you see the house we live in now 
you didn t see the toilets i had to clean 
or the days we went hungry 
it wasn t that bad 
nights sitting in a chair with a broom 
keeping the rats out of daryn s crib 
  i don t remember any of that 
  good  it s because we made a plan 
but sometimes  bad shit just happens 
i mean  some stuff you can t keep away with a broom  right 
apparently not 
you know  i just love these candlesticks 
are they silver 
actually  i believe those are pewter 
  so  isabelle  where do you go to school 
  she s homeschooled  actually 
  what about college 
  i hadn t given it much thought yet 
  not everybody is destined for higher education 
  i actually couldn t agree more 
i think the world could do with a few
less fancy degrees and a few more artists 
  who live in their parents  basements 
  like half of all college grads 
  dessert 
  daryn is destined to do great things 
  maybe he s already doing great things 
  the first steps to any plan is identifying a proper goal 
harvard undergraduate first 
  then  yale law 
  i just got exhausted even listening to that shit 
not everybody can be a super fun au pair 
  maybe that s enough  xavier 
  because i m his father  and he is my son 
  dad 
  we have a responsibility to each other 
  he puts his faith in me  and i protect him 
  from what  zombies 
  no  from you 
  excuse you 
  girls like you  girls your type 
  dad 
  i am so sorry 
  dad 
     distraction that you ve become in his life 
  dad  i got waitlisted 
excuse me 
  well  that s not a no  so let s remain positive 
  when did you find this out 
  a week or two ago 
  and you re just telling me this now 
  i m sure he had a reason 
  stop coddling him 
don t you see he s throwing his life away for you 
how can you be this selfish 
  i mean  there s no future here 
  okay  enough  let s go  we re going 
  i am really sorry 
  stand up  here we go  sweetheart 
daryn 
come here  sweetheart  easy 
  thank you for the wonderful dinner  catherine 
  i m sorry 
and this is mine now  bitch 
i hope you re happy  son 
i managed to get us a meeting with james maxwell 
we have to be perfect in there  son 
don t focus so much on athletic accomplishments 
and make sure to mention honors society 
all right  hey  just stick to the script  okay 
just stick to the script 
one foot and then the other 
  i see you ve been waitlisted 
  yes  sir 
at least it s not a no 
yeah  yeah  your grades have slipped a little lately 
a temporary situation that has been rectified 
honestly  this is just a paper
that tells me what you ve done 
what i m really interested in is who you are 
well  i m captain of the varsity track team 
i m a member of national honors society 
and i have the state record in the 5000 meter   
and i have a   
   gpa of   
blah  blah  blah 
i m listing a bunch of bullshit right now 
here s who i am 
i might suck at punching people 
but i can get an entire ice cream shop going 
i can eat like a person  but i can also be an asshole 
i know that greatness requires sacrifice  hard work 
and dedication  but i also know that clouds are for cupids 
and some things you just can t keep away with a broom 
and i know that i have to be true to myself
before i can be true to her  but   
she s not here right now 
i m sorry  i ve wasted your time  sir  so i m gonna go 
  and nice to see you again  daryn 
  it s good to see you as well  mr  maxwell 
  i gotta go 
  excuse me for a moment 
how did it go 
wait 
you re a stupid  selfish child 
all this hard work  all this sacrifice  you re just gonna
throw it away for a damn girl 
  her name is isabelle  she s not just some damn girl 
  xavier 
  we had a plan 
  you know what i think of that plan 
let me show you what i think 
  hey  come here 
  xavier

i thought so 
   never gotten a request quite like this one before 
it comes from a dying girl named isabelle 
i m gonna have to clean some of the language up
because my girl can curse 
so isabelle writes 
 everybody thinks that dying
teaches you something about life 
but they re wrong 
the only way to learn about life is by living 
and i ve learned that every moment
is your moment 
sometimes the moments are messy 
sometimes they re beautiful 
or scary  or just plain weird 
but they re all yours 
cherish them 
living isn t easy 
but if you can manage to look past your own fears
and everyone else s expectations 
the reward is your life 
and in my life 
i was loved 
so  daryn  one more 
she also sent me this track and told me
i had to play it or else she would haunt me 
so here is the world premiere
