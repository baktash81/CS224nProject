the police flushed stampler from
his hiding place behind the cathedral
they chased him through
the train yard almost losing him
as he scrambled over tracks before
an oncoming train separated them
prominent local criminal
defence attorney martin vail
is believed to have visited stampler
at the maxwell street
after a brief chase across the rail yard
behind st michaels cathedral
stampler was apprehended
in a hole beneath train tracks
are you defending this man
im sorry
thank you very much thank you
weve taken the first step
in the process
i can now take your questions
shaughnessy what about the
altar boy group stampler was part of
not much at this time
could other altar boys be involved
we have no reason to suspect
anyone other than stampler
he had access to the archbishops
quarters he was caught as he fled
the bloodsoaked aaron stampler
was chased under mccormick place
but not before he was almost killed
by a passing train
hes gonna call you
as soon as he gets here thank you
naomi
yeah
sorry im late
we have a new client
i was afraid you were gonna say that
who
you know what theyre calling him
the butcher boy of st mikes
i like that
youll be hearing it a lot
is the kid who chopped up
the archbishop our client
you have to get allegedly into your
vocabulary if you want to be a lawyer
coffee tommy
no thanks
he admits he was in the room when
the killing occurred but he didnt see it
can i stop you right there
no he was returning a book
he heard loud noises in the bedroom
he went in he sees a figure in
the shadows kneeling over the body
he blacks out next thing he knows
sirens are screaming
hes covered in blood
the cops find him in a train tunnel
hes got the archbishops ring on him
he stole the archbishops ring
no it was in his pocket
is that it
yep
thats
thats the worst bullshit story
ive heard in my entire life
now its our bullshit story
ok lets get to work
the name of the game is motive
the prosecution doesnt have one
we have to prove that someone
else could have committed the crime
then we can establish
reasonable doubt
i want to know ever√Ωthing i can
about this guy
go to database
go to hall of records irs files
even socalled charities
socalled he was a priest
naomi write this down b 321 56 it
was carved into the archbishops chest
allegedly
no that was a fact
but i appreciate the effort
thanks
i also need case histories on murder
by stabbing mutilation and religion
also im gonna need a psychiatrist
youre telling me
not the kind who lives
in a witness box i need a real one
and an expert on amnesia
what does he look like in person
the butcher boy
like a boy scout
a boy scout
with a merit badge in carving
the archbishop was
a close friend of mr shaughnessy
he asked me who my best man was
i said you
thank you
i trust if im to prosecute this case
ill get the authority
which comes with it
youre the one trying the case
but lets establish one thing
at the outset i want the death penalty
id like to go over the case before we
determine whether or not to seek that
im open to anything you have to say
but in my mind theres no debate
did the boy they picked up
say anything
yeah he didnt do it
its a slam dunk janet
excuse me
i appreciate your faith in me
i dont mean to be argumentative
its what we pay you for
open and shut you dont need me
the pdll plead no contest and throw
the kid on the mercy of the court
theres not a public defender
hes got a lawyer already who
hey im martin vail
im defending aaron stampler
i need to inspect the murder site
oh the butcher boy huh
thank you yes i forgot his real name
whats the matter marty
lost your faith
looking for a little religion
tell me counsellor which one of us
is the true headline chaser here
unlike you i was assigned
yeah and youre up to it
sold the book rights or will you wait
wanna see some pictures
theyre kind of cute
i think youll agree they clearly show
the heinous nature of the crime
small piece of advice dont use
the word heinous in the courtroom
half the jury wont know
what you mean
small piece of advice im not
sitting second chair to you any more
in case you hadnt noticed
i graduated
i had no reason to leave
you had every reason to leave
how can you still work for them
you expect me to trot out after you
quit just because you did
i dont need a mercedes i dont need
to see my face on the evening news
you knew i was coming here
didnt you
you knew i would defend him
thats why you took the case
oh please whats the matter marty
are you nervous
been a while since you rubbed up
against a woman with a brain
whats the matter you tired
you havent been sleeping well
youre the one with the score to settle
i sleep great at night
cook county dept of corrections
div ix maximum security dormitory
thanks
hey where is he
over here
well be sitting at a table
with two of my associates
once the charges are read
the judgell ask how you plead
not guilty
no
but im not guilty mr vail
it doesnt matter
keep your mouth shut
are you gonna say im not guilty
ill say whatever i say dont worry
but
this is what i mean
this cant go on in the courtroom get
used to it i speak you do not speak
your job is to sit and look innocent
i am innocent
thats it thats how i want you to look
can you remember that
look in the mirror if you have to
i dont have to
this is how i always look
then youre way ahead
of the game already arent you
dont smile
dont
mr vail can we have a statement
were gonna find out what happened
the only pressure is to find the truth
youve talked to the police i told you
not to they get ever√Ωthing wrong
how will you explain
his bloodsoaked clothes
i wont explain anything now
ive just been retained in this case
significant facts are in dispute here
and continue to be so
youre a master at putting the victim
on trial to help your client
thatll be very difficult in this case
the victim in this case is my client
we have two victims here
no suspects thank you
you worried about his safety
no thank you
i dont think theres any question
about the verdict
all rise
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
bailiff
the state versus aaron stampler
is every sit down everyone here
yes your honour
madame prosecutor
the state charges aaron stampler
with murder in the first degree
how does your client plead
if it pleases the court
i need time to make
a psychiatric evaluation before
charges are brought against us
the state has enough evidence
to warrant the allegations
i agree motion denied
mr stampler
do you understand the charges
yes
i direct my client not to answer that
his response might incriminate him
he is taking the fifth on whether
or not he understands the charges
yes until we have a complete
psychological evaluation
he will be taking the fifth on any
and all questions posed to him
the state versus appleby
for your review on precedent
thank you
no i cant do that no
what do you want
im looking for the room a kid named
aaron stampler stayed in
are you the police
im his uncle
well hey
this is alexs
whos alex
hes one of the other altar boys
an altar boy
an altar boy was wearing this
well not at mass
this altar boy attacked a colleague
of mine and hurt him pretty bad
what do you think he was doing
in your room
i cant i dont know
i dont have nothing
you know where to find him
who alex
no i dont know where he is
you dont
whos linda
llinda
is she your girlfriend
where is she id like to talk to her
i dont know where she is
i get this feeling
youre not telling me something
im telling you the truth
i dont think so
are you surprised
that alex attacked my friend
no no he has a temper
yeah id say so
do you think it could be alex
who was that figure you saw
at the archbishops room
i alex i couldnt be sure
but it could be him
i dont know
you dont understand
the state wants you dead
you dont help me
thats what theyll get
im trying i cant remember
i dont understand why would alex
wanna do such a thing
for his own reasons
maybe someone hired him
hired by who
forget it
do you think hes capable of doing it
i dont know
i dont know whos capable
of such a thing
oh thanks
sure
he claims there was someone else
in the room and he cant remember
you want me to look into this amnesia
question and see what he knows
what if he knows he did it
major causes of amnesia are
substance abuse seizures
head injuries and malingering
i think the kid is telling the truth
ok then lets get something straight
im happy to go in and analyse him
in fact im looking forward to it
but i wont go in there
to validate a story understood
you do your job
i do mine yatta yatta
if i think its necessary
id wanna get an mrl eeg
and neuropsych testing
yes doctor good night
good night
ill be recording our meetings
for mr vail
so it isnt as confidential as it would be
if you were consulting with the doctor
he may even call me as a witness
if you have any questions
you should raise them to him now
no maam i understand
good so ok i think well be fine
ill see you later
ok
bye
vail told me theres time surrounding
the death you dont remember
is that right
yes
i lost the time
i mean i blacked out
have you had blackouts before
yes i have
whens the first time
you remember them happening
they started when i was about twelve
were your parents aware
of what was happening to you
nno my mmmother was dead
and your father
no no he was not a nice man
did you seek treatment
did i what
did you see a doctor for them
oh
no
you dont go to a doctor in creekside
unless your legs broken
hey can i talk to you
talk
excuse us ill bring her right back
how dare you
am i a chess piece you can
move around i was having lunch
when are we getting all the discovery
what do you want
i want to know when
ive got motions to file
no you dont
youre looking to make a deal
i have no authority to deal from
my client whats your excuse
if we needed to make a deal
i have all the authority i want
bullshit shaughnessy wants the
whole shot hes using you to get it
deal this down
to murder with no death penalty
deal down
we have a fucking great case
great case lack of prior record no
eye witness no confession no motive
hard evidence i assume youre not
going with insanity which is a shame
my shrinks would have torn him apart
your pleading the fifth
on the charges was brilliant
it was good wasnt it i liked it
you lose this case you take the fall
not shaughnessy
talk to me
were going to trial marty
all right all it takes is one
one juror who doesnt believe he did it
one juror with a kid
who looks into that face
that face is great you prepping him
to take the stand
that stutter is pppriceless
oh marty
dont tell me you think he didnt do it
has little aaron stampler
gotten to you
were not just talking about jail here
but ending someones life
if youre wrong and shaughnessys
made you do this can you live with it
ill live
see you in court
we stipulate
that murder was done here
so these photos
have no probative value
this is not just murder
its mutilation and torture
the prosecution wants to show them
to the jury for shock appeal
not true they clearly identify
the heinous nature of the crime
and they connect the defendant found
covered in blood to the crime scene
prejudicial
i beg to differ
counsel please
the photos are in mr vail
would you like a recess
to carry on with this in private
im sorry your honour
but this is too much
next thing hell be objecting
if we bring in the murder weapon
now that she brings it up
this is a public building
excuse me mr vail
would you sign this for me
tell me about linda
mr vail said she was your girlfriend
yes she was
how did you meet
well we were both
at the savior house
i was an altar boy she was doing
work for bishop rushman
what was the relationship like
me and linda
she is real cultural
real cultural and very smart
we had a nice time together
we might get married
were you sleeping together
well thats private
i know i have to ask the question
were you having
a sexual relationship aaron
yes we were
were you sleeping with anyone else
at the time
no
was she
has she been to see you aaron
well no but
and that upsets you
no no the thing is she went away
she went away for a while
she left before this happened
i dont even think
i dont even think she knows about it
yo boss
hey got something for me
yeah
theres nothing catalogued downtown
under the numbers b 321 56
but i dont think the b is a b its an 8
i think the knife slipped 8321 56
thomas jefferson
i dont think he did it
this wont help rushmans charities
and his foundations investments
nothing startling
except how many there are
wait a minute here
what was he doing
with the south river deal pull that up
loading file
yeah the investors
shaughnessy
thats joey pineros neighbourhood
see this lot here
this all used to be houses
in fact there was a house in the corner
where i kissed my first girlfriend
got her pregnant too
hell of a kiss joey
oh yeah
the neighbourhood will end up
highrent condos if they get their way
thats why ill buy back the lot
with the settlement you got me
you heard about the money right
who hasnt
martys the best man
just doing my job
1 500000 hes just doing his job
alderman joey tells me a cop came
around wanting him to set you up
its typical
cant buy me
so they try to buy a brother
most people assume this land were
walking on belongs to the railroad
but it doesnt it belongs to the church
the church
so thats the rushman foundation
thats right
with a bunch of rich developers
including john shaughnessy
they bought up land and buildings
around the church property
and tore them down
our neighbourhood would disappear
i went to the archbishop and said
what are you doing to these people
theyre poor theyre getting
kicked out of their homes
and theyre catholic
fucking a
he listened i couldnt believe it
he told them to stop developing
around the church property
the partners hold buildings they cant
demolish and land they cant build on
shaughnessy loses millions
if i need you to will you testify
who me
oh yeah easy
just change out of this suit put on
a brooks brothers with loafers and
no joey not you
sure
ill testify
you know what people think
that this great city runs itself
they think it gets up goes to work and
climbs into bed at night like we do
unaware of what it takes to make sure
it doesnt break down
crime fires riots
the water pipes bursting under
the city what a mess that was
and the water commissioner
calls the contractor who built it
no he calls me they all call me
goddamn this is terrific
they call me because i keep
the peace thats my job
this city doesnt burn
because i wont permit it
im the great negotiator
you think people get that
the truth is i dont care
the dumb bastards dont even vote
they just eat sleep watch tv
and occasionally fuck their wives
guess we should all thank you
youre welcome
john you need some new material
ive heard this greatcity speech
ten times already
your boy pinero is not honouring
his side of the deal
is that what this dinner is about
in part
i told him what the deal is
hes a grown up what else
your assistants been digging around
in the archbishops finances
yeah well
how much did you lose when he
pulled the plug from south river
let me tell you something
its a mistake to stick your thumb in
the eyes of the citys most powerful
its not their eyes im aiming for
do not fuck with me marty
the pipes are bursting again john
in the most anticipated murder trial
in recent chicago history
former state attorney prosecutor
martin vail will lead
richard rushman was a man of god
he spent his life giving
to the people of chicago
he was a beacon ofinspiration
not only as a spiritual leader
deliver his opening statement
tomorrow
my name is martin vail the reason
im here and the reason youre here
is to make sure
the whole truth is known
we can learn the truth
by talking about what the prosecution
does not want you to hear
do not be fooled by the defendants
innocent appearance and demeanour
aaron stampler sat injudgment
ofarchbishop rushman
and determined
that not only should he die
but he should die the most brutal
we all saw aaron being arrested
minutes after the archbishops death
but why because he was convenient
and the police were under pressure
the evidence will show that aaron
stampler stalked ambushed
and savagely murdered
this great man
the prosecution doesnt want you
to hear about
the other altar boys who have
mysteriously disappeared
at the close of evidence
you will learn
that aaron stampler
had everything he needed
for the perfect assassination
using this knife
aaron stampler repeatedly stabbed
at the archbishops chest
his genitals and his eyes
they dont want you to hear
that the archbishop
invested on behalf
of the roman catholic church
investments resulting in huge losses
for some very powerful people
they dont want you to hear about the
20 death threats he received this year
and they really dont want you
to hear about their theory of motive
why is that very simple
they dont have one
inspector woodside explain to the
court where the sneakers came from
they were taken off the defendant
when he was apprehended
what was the result
of the bloodstain analysis
they proved to be human blood
matching the blood type and dna
characteristics of the archbishop
what did the bloody footprints
surrounding the body tell you
the killer left a pattern of footprints
around the area of the struggle
as indicated by the spread of blood
through the room
yes or no inspector could there have
been a third person in the quarters
theres no evidence to suggest that
no evidence proves there wasnt
no
what happened after the struggle
our analysis suggests
the killer was startled and ran
from the bedroom and down the stairs
is it possible inspector
that the real killer the third person
who maybe was smart enough not
to tramp a whole freeway of blood
through the whole place
couldnt this third person have placed
the defendants prints on the knife
while he was passed out
anything is possible
clearly the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds
yes he did 78
he tried to defend himself that
explains cuts on hands and forearms
doctor isnt it a fact
that you cant be sure
whether more than one person inflicted
these 78 stab and incised wounds
it could have been more than one
but i doubt it
from your analysis
of the knife wounds
do you have an opinion whether
the killer was left or righthanded
the wounds to the throat
and most of the chest wounds
were made from an angle that strongly
suggests a lefthanded person
is the defendant lefthanded
yes he is
its possible a righthanded person
could have used his left hand
yes i suppose thats possible
then its reasonable to assume there
was a third person at the crime scene
reasonable no but it is possible
then following opening statements
it was a day ofstrong testimony
from the prosecutions first witnesses
forensics chiefharvey woodside
and medical examiner emile weil
it was also tough crossexamination
of woodside and weil
by stampler defence attorney
martin vail
captain stenner thank you
for the time youve given us
but finally id like to turn your attention
to the symbol carved into the chest
would you please tell the jury
about that captain
yes the letter and the numbers
b 321 56 were carved
into the archbishops chest
have you been able to find
an identical reference anywhere
i believe so yes
the symbol b 321 56 is actually
catalogue code for a book
discovered in a private reading room
located in the church basement
that particular number the b 32 part
refers to a book the scarlet letter
by nathaniel hawthorne
when we opened the book
to page 1 56
we discovered an underlined passage
could you please read
this underlined passage to the court
no man for any considerable period
can wear one face to himself
and another to the multitude
without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true
thank you
what does that passage mean to you
objection hes a policeman
not an english professor
his interpretation will be
speculative and irrelevant
she didnt ask for an expert opinion
witness can answer
well to me its simple
the killer thought his victim was
twofaced dishonest in some way
in your experience captain
do killers ever intentionally
leave clues to their motive
not often but it happens
thanks
thanks man
yeah sure
did you underline that book
what
did you underline that book
no mr vail
no
no mr vail i never even opened
the scarlet letter
i dont like hawthorne
we had that one about the house with
the seven somethings in high school

mister vail
yeah im right here aaron
he did it the little fuck did it
how could i have missed that
am i gonna need stitches
no
he didnt do it aaron has no idea
what just happened in there
i kept seeing the signs the big ones
abusive background these repeated
blackouts the ellipses in thought
hes ambidextrous i tried to tell you
you may be thrilled by all this
but im fucked i dont have a case
textbook multiple personality disorder
put me on the stand ill testify
hes insane
i cant i cant change plea
in the middle of a trial
the judge would never allow it
insanity is the hardest thing to prove
ok
my professional opinion
this is not a criminal
were dealing with hes a sick kid
hes sitting in a cell
and thats not where he belongs
you got an aspirin
come on connerman ask it
ask what
the question
you wanted to ask me before
i dont understand mr vail
how can you defend someone
if you know they did it
how can you defend these
fucking scumbags isnt that it
all those fucking coy questions
all that bullshit
bottom line is
how can you do what you do
you think its the money dont you
the moneys nice
the moneys very very nice jack
the first thing i ask a new client is
you been saving up for a rainy day
guess what its raining
you think its because i want to see
my face on magazine covers
my 1 5 seconds on tv i love it
i fucking love that shit i really do
but guess what
its not it
you go to las vegas
yeah
i dont go to vegas
why dont i go to vegas
marty its late
i think we should just get up and
why gamble with money when you
can gamble with peoples lives
that was a joke
all right ill tell you
i believe in the notion that people
are innocent until proven guilty
i believe in that notion
because i choose to believe
in the basic goodness of people
i choose to believe that not all crimes
are committed by bad people
and i try to understand
that some very good people
do some very bad things
you know when i was working
for shaughnessy
i did something very very bad
illegal i was a prosecutor then
this thing i did i was very upset by it
and decided to leave
so i left
i became a defending attorney
the irony being that everyone
assumed i was lying anyhow
i made myself this little promise that
l would reserve my lies
for other than my public life
you print any of this
ill sue your fucking ass
all right so i made a little mistake
no shit
what do you want a new suit
ill buy you a new suit
you made a mistake
you told us the third man did it
you got your third man
and a fourth man and a fifth man
what are you going to do marty
i dont know i really fucked up here
you were right
so how are you gonna get him off
i dont know
what i know is that aaron did
not commit firstdegree murder
he stabbed him a billion times
not aaron
to convict someone of a capital crime
the state must prove intent
roy had intent aaron didnt
then you have to plead insanity
which we cant do midtrial
unless you plan a career change
i couldve been mistaken
but i wasnt wrong
aaron is innocent
its roy who is guilty
he doesnt need a lawyer
he needs an exorcist
youre full of shit
you werent there you didnt see it
hes one sick boy whos been fucked
around by his father by his priest
its our job to make sure the jury
believes he doesnt deserve to die
ok
ok how do we do it
by somehow introducing
this whole abuse thing
the tape
thats crazy that gives him motive
no it looks like that but its
no actually
it turns this whole thing around
it gives concrete documentation
of what rushman did to this kid
but we cant put it in you know that
but were not going to
oh fuck
ok
good
what the hell are you doing
you know damn well who it is
barleycorns marty now
janet
cute porno part of your collection
hey
where did you get it steal it
from the crime scene
i dont know anything
you are such a liar
think about it
if it contains that
i wouldnt give it to you its motive
you had to give it to me
if you introduced it the juryd despise
you for dishonouring the bishop
if you get me to show it motive or
no motive im the one who looks bad
and you gain sympathy
for your poor little abused boy
you think so
i hate you
dont use it
i have no intention of using it
the usual stu
you got it
youre up to even more than that
im not up to anything
youre opening a door for me with
a tiger on the other end and i dont
you know who youd really upset
shaughnessy
fuck him
fuck him
fuck you
thanks a lot
if this is not your motive what is
i have motive
yeah what is it
im really gonna tell you
better tell the jury soon
times running out
here you go
you think youve got me huh
you think because you know me as
well as you do you know how i think
well i know how you think
you know what im thinking
what happened to your face
i i bumped it
in a medicine cabinet
no that was a girl on her way out
we should come back here later
they close in ten minutes
no after
after the trial
when we got nothing to lose
how can your timing
be so good in a courtroom
and so bad in real life
ill think about it later
i hate you too much right now
you got a visitor
here she comes
talk to you later
janet
morning
so wheres the tape
theres some pretty ugly stuff
on that tape
yes there is
who wouldve thought
where did it come from
landed on my front door no note
vail
who else
clever prick
what do you think hes up to
i honestly dont know
cut the crap
you know him well
you were balling him
where is it
at home
i have some advice for you
if you have aspirations beyond
this particular office
pick up your handbag
go home and destroy this tape
you shouldve destroyed like i did
you dont think vail has a copy
you dont think theres an original
stampler is on trial
not the catholic church
if you havent found another motive
to hang him on god help you
all rise
please sit down
madame prosecutor
miss venable
the state calls thomas goodman
objection your honour
prosecution knows mr goodman
is my investigator in this case
and under the work product rule
he cant be compelled to testify
permission to approach the bench
granted
i have important evidence
which the witness can authenticate
thats mr vails privilege if he doesnt
want goodman to testify he wont
make a decision mr vail
you ever been to my apartment
no
by that i mean my apartment building
allegedly
im sorry you have or you havent
allegedly doesnt figure into it
i havebeen there yes
why did you go there
i was delivering something
for whom
martin vail
mr vail sent you
to deliver something to me
yes
what was it
a video tape
could this be the tape
you delivered for mr vail
i have a feeling it is yes
the people place
this video tape in evidence
so ordered please index
where did mr vail get this tape
if it is the same one
he took it from the closet
of archbishop rushman
stole it
borrowed it
once i made the transfer for him
i returned it
can you describe whats on the tape
there was a sermon
by archbishop rushman a rehearsal
followed by
a kind of home movie
a home movie of what
some altar boys
and
a girl
doing what
an altar boy lesson of some kind
having sex
quiet
a porno movie
mm yes
yes now
how is it that this tape this porno tape
was in the archbishops closet
in order for vail to find it there
he was thedirector
who was
archbishop rushman
quiet
and was the defendant one of
the altar boys performing in the movie
yes he was
was his girlfriend linda forbes
yes she was
did it appear to you
that the defendant was enjoying
performing in this film
with his girlfriend
no he does not
i will not ask you if you
think weve uncovered motive here
we will decide that for ourselves
once weve all seen the video tape
no further questions
does defence wish to cross
no your honour
courts in recess
bailiff please set up for the tape
mr goodman youre excused
thanks for the advice
mr vail said she was your girlfriend
yes she was
how did you meet
we were both at the savior house
i was an altar boy
and she was working
for bishop rushman
doing what
were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time
no no
was she
nnno
has she been to see you aaron
yeah yeah im still here
what
mr vail are you prepared to proceed
with your first witness
yes your honour
the defence calls john shaughnessy
the people object mr shaughnessy
has never been identified as
your honour may i approach
yes you may
my client is on trial for his life he
maintains there was a third person
can mr shaughnessy confirm that
the us constitution
takes precedence here
permitting calling any witness
to prove innocence
thats stated in the sixth amendment
and profound in brady vs maryland
mr shaughnessy you sit on the board
of the rushman foundation
i am an honorary board member
explain the nature
and purpose of this foundation
it was founded by the late archbishop
its purpose is to invest in projects
for the greater good of the community
the greater good of the community
ok
would that be true
in the case of the now bankrupt
south river housing development
yes
could you tell the court why the south
river project was abandoned
there was a difference of opinion
as to the costs
wasnt there also
a difference of opinion
between the investors
and the late archbishop
i dont recall
you dont
what kind of money
are we talking about
how much money was invested
in this failed south river enterprise
60 million dollars
quiet
60 million dollars
wow thats a lot of money
you and the archbishop
have been friends for 20 years
you knew each other well
thats right
did that tapes content surprise you
yes of course
youve never heard any allegations
against the archbishop
not that i recall no
especially since you were states
attorney for the last 1 5 years
youve supervised all prosecutions
in cook county during that time
especially the prosecutions
of prominent figures
i also have a staff of
a thousand of the best prosecutors
as states attorney
it was up to you ultimately to decide
who would be indicted
yes
let me just take you back now
lets go back to june 1 985
do you recall any allegations
of sexual misconduct
against the archbishop then
i dont recall that no
do you recall a young man
by the name of michael odonnell
who came to the felony review unit
at your office
i have no idea
what youre talking about
thats confusing because a document
from the chicago metropolitan police
says that michael odonnell spoke
to the supervisor for two weeks
explaining sexual abuse he suffered
at the hands of archbishop rushman
isnt it also true mr states attorney
that you then decided that your friend
was not going to stand trial
for any of it
he owed you big time john
you must have been pissed off
when he pulled out of south river
he just said i cant take it any more
he said no
you and your investors
had 60 million reasons to kill him
you little cocksucker
thats it witness dismissed
vail in my chambers now
thats for joey pinero shithead
start looking for a job
you think you can use my courtroom to
wage vendettas and settle old scores
you are sorely mistaken
im striking shaughnessys testimony
from the record as irrelevant
and im holding you in contempt
to the tune of 1 0000 dollars
youre saying that i cant get
a fair trial in your courtroom
be very careful mr vail
youre on dangerous ground
you want the cheque
made out to you
you want me to take you off this case
youre making a mockery of
my courtroom and i wont allow it
i suggest you start representing your
client and stop representing yourself
can we do this later
no i want to stay with this
im feeling very very tired
yeah i know
why does talking
about linda forbes upset you
it doesnt ijust
ok
im sorry im sorry
you know what i can do with this
how the fuck should i know
dr arrington how much time
have you spent with aaron stampler
around 60 hours
what did you find in your evaluation
mr stampler suffers from
an acute disassociative condition
multiple personality disorder
objection your honour
shes only stating
what shes personally observed
your honour
counsellors
i know what youre doing
excuse us for a minute
if he wants to question
his clients sanity
im trying to establish
a medical basis for amnesia
thats not what hes doing
hes saying hes crazy
are you
no i am not
ill allow you to proceed
with this witness if youre very careful
absolutely yes
write down that he said that
all right where were we
now could aaron stampler
have been present during the murder
of archbishop rushman
and not remember it
yes he could
could you explain that please
stamplers state was such that his
body could be present at a homicide
and yet his mind
would be unable to recall it
how would this be possible
this neurological mechanism
began with the early abuse
suffered at the hands of his father
in defence aarons psyche splintered
into two separate personalities
your honour
i didnt say it i did not say it
youve been warned twice
you wanna pursue this
and i suggest you think long and hard
before answering
your honour just one last question
all right dr arrington
in your opinion is aaron stampler
capable of murder
no hes far too traumatised to
express normal anger and frustration
he keeps his emotions repressed
which is why he created roy
who is capable
objection
thats enough mr vail
the jury will disregard this witness
last statement as will the court
prosecutor do you wish to cross
you bet i do
since you brought it up
against the instructions of the court
is multiple personality disorder
your primary area of expertise
its not my primary field no
is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise
no im a neuropsychologist
i see
so you have no forensic experience
and youre more of an academic
then you will forgive
this rather academic question
im driving somebody cuts me off
i feel like killing this guy
but i dont now do l
i would hope not
thats right
things happen to us
people wrong us
but we dont all invent psychopaths
to do our dirty work for us doctor
im not suggesting
you have multiple personalities
im saying mr stampler does
yes i know we heard
you have also testified that you have
met this what was his name again
roy
roy what
he didnt give a last name
i see
did this roy tell you
that he had murdered the archbishop
mr vail was with him i was outside
but soon after i was in the room
and saw both roy
and his transformation back to aaron
did you happen to tape
this appearance of aaron
oh im sorry
i just cannot get used to this name
roy
did you
no the tape was off
off
so you have no record whatsoever
of his appearance
no
no
does aaron know right from wrong
yes he does
if aaron butchered the archbishop
objection
would he know
if aaron murdered the archbishop
would he know hed broken the law
yes he would but it wasnt aaron
oh yes i know doctor it was roy
thats all
no further questions your honour
witness may step down
if youd like to reopen your case
and call the states psychiatrist
l will certainly agree to it
no l
i dont think thats necessary
i think we all get the picture here
mr vail are you ready to proceed
would you like a recess
roy
aaron
could you tell us a little about
your relationship with the archbishop
well he was like a father to me
i loved him very much
why did you love him
why
aha
well hehe ssaved my life
he was the only person who ever
treated me like i was worth anything
stop your whining little girl be a man
weve all seen that tape
that you were in aaron
how did that make you feel did it
change your feelings about rushman
no
he was a wonderful man
so you didnt feel anger towards him
for forcing you to perform in that tape
no he did ever√Ωthing for me
there was nothing else
i could do for him and he needed it
do you know someone named roy
no i dont
you heard dr arringtons testimony
about what she and i saw at the jail
there are strange things going on
do you remember
i heard what she said
but i dont remember any of that
did you kill archbishop rushman
no sir i did not
thank you
your witness
mr stampler
would you like some water
nno maam
you sure
yeyes maam
mr stampler did you believe
that the archbishop wore masks
im sorry what did you say
do you think he acted one way
in public and another way in private
nno i dont think that
isnt that why you underlined
the hawthorne passage
mr stampler
no i did not underline that book
you didnt underline it
no maam
and you didnt carve the numbers
of that passage into his chest
no maam i did not
i told you l
you loved him
you loved him like a father
even though
he made you and your girlfriend
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification
no you dont understand he
there was no other way for him
to cast out his demons he
he needed to get off aaron
thats what he was doing
thats what he needed you for
to perform like a circus animal
that was your function in his life
nno
oh mr stampler im gonna ask
you straight because i am tired
ive had enough of this sordidness
and i wanna go home
and i wanna wash my hands
and i wanna forget all about you
and archbishop rushman
did the archbishop force you
and your girlfriend and others
to perform sexual acts
while he watched yes or no
yes he did but
yes yes he forced you
he forced you using a threat
of expulsion from savior house
and a life on the street with no heat
and no water and no food
he put you in front of a camera
he made you take off your clothes
and you dont think
thats another side
another face of a man
that we all thought
no no
someone did that to me id kill him
i would stab him 78 times
with a butcher knife
i would chop off his fingers
i would slash his throat open
i would carve numbers into his chest
i would gouge out his eyes i swear
but thats me
no further questions
where the hell are you going
look at me
when im talking to you bitch
fuck you lady come here
order bailiff order
lets play rough come on back off
roy
keep coming and ill break her neck
come here and talk
fuck you marty im walking out

dont even think of lighting
that cigarette miss venable
hows your neck
ill live
i could call a doctor
mr shaughnessy just called
to inform me there will be no mistrial
as if that was his right
i cant believe
that scumbag has the balls to call
no thanks
what matters to me is what you have
to say your case has been damaged
in fairness to the prosecution
i would declare a mistrial
regardless of what shaughnessy
and vail think if thats what you want
the prosecution doesnt wanna try
this case again even if it could
which it cant at least not by me
i think i can guarantee you
theres no one
in the das office who will
soits up to you
im gonna dismiss the jury
in favour of a bench trial
and a blind plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity yes
the defendant will be remanded
to elgin for a 30day evaluation period
let them decide
the term of his commitment
do you have a problem with that
hell be out in a month
take it up with the legislature
miss venable
