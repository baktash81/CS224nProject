  nice to see you again 
we have come to the heart of
the matter  why we re here tonight 
it s the fifth straight year
it s been my privilege
to serve as master of ceremony
for the chicago bar association

  it s a bar for christ s sake 
i thought you quit

look at me 
come on  let s go find a bar

thanks for the invite  but i don t like
one night stands all that much 
we saw each other for months 
it was a one night stand  marty 
it just lasted six months 
well  i must say i haven t seen
this many lawyers and politicians
gathered together in one place
since confession this morning 
there is no way the people
will tolerate a monetary award
to a cockroach
who deserves twenty to life 
he may be your client  but joey pinero
was a hard case felon 
  dealing  racketeering  money   
  did you say  alleged   yancy 
did you hear him say  alleged  
mr pinero has never
been convicted of anything 
the cops left him bleeding in the snow 
a miracle he survived 
having said that 
i m not opposed to a settlement 
1  500 000 and pinero leaves the state 
you can t limit a citizen s right
to live where he wants to 
legally  that s unenforceable 
enforceable or just
a gentleman s agreement 
mr pinero will know what we want 
get the answer you re looking for 
don t sit around and chat  a pleasure 
you re worse
than the thugs you represent 
  that s enough  bud  it s over 
  i have to run this by him 
you re on a 40  commission  i m sure
your recommendation will prevail 
thank you  john

and i sing in his choir 
how long were you there  aaron 
savior house 
a year  year and a half

yes  yes  it was 
aaron  did you have any reason
to dislike the archbishop

  yes  i did 
  but they didn t believe me 
  all right  you tell me now 
i was returning a book
to bishop rushman s library 
i heard a noise 
so i went back into his bedroom 
bishop rushman
was lying on the floor 
there was blood all over ever√Ωthing 
then i saw the shadow 
i saw a person
ieaning over bishop rushman 
he looked up  and he came at me 
and that s when i lost time 
what does that mean  lost time 
i bla    i blacked out 
it happens to me sometimes 
i have   
  spells  i have spells 
i lose time 
i can t remember nothing 
why did you run from the police 
aaron  if you didn t do anything wrong 
well  when i woke up 
i was covered in blood 
i didn t know what to do 
i got scared 
i heard sirens  so i ran 
look  i know how it looks  mr vail 
but i swear   
i don t need you to convince me 
just answer my questions 
  i didn t do this  you got to believe me 
  no  i don t  i don t care 
i am your attorney  which means
i m your mother  your father 
your best friend and your priest 
i don t want you talking
to anyone but me 
not the cops  the press 
the guys in the cells  nobody 
without my permission

  well  a 38  iong 
the police flushed stampler from
his hiding place behind the cathedral 
they chased him through
the train yard  almost losing him
as he scrambled over tracks before
an oncoming train separated them 
prominent local criminal
defence attorney martin vail
is believed to have visited stampler
at the maxwell street    
after a brief chase across the rail yard
behind st  michael s cathedral 
stampler was apprehended
in a hole beneath train tracks   
  are you defending this man 
  i m sorry   
thank you very much  thank you 
we ve taken the first step
in the process 
i can now take your questions 
shaughnessy  what about the
altar boy group stampler was part of 
not much at this time 
could other altar boys be involved 
we have no reason to suspect
anyone other than stampler 
he had access to the archbishop s
quarters  he was caught as he fled 
the blood soaked aaron stampler
was chased under mccormick place 
but not before he was almost killed
by a passing train 
he s gonna call you
as soon as he gets here  thank you 
  naomi 
  yeah 
sorry  i m late 
we have a new client 
  i was afraid you were gonna say that 
  who 
you know what they re calling him 
the butcher boy of st  mike s 
  i like that 
  you ll be hearing it a lot 
is the kid who chopped up
the archbishop our client 
you have to get  allegedly  into your
vocabulary if you want to be a lawyer 
  coffee  tommy 
  no  thanks 
he admits he was in the room when
the killing occurred  but he didn t see it 
  can i stop you right there 
  no  he was returning a book 
he heard loud noises in the bedroom 
he went in  he sees a figure in
the shadows  kneeling over the body 
he blacks out  next thing he knows 
sirens are screaming 
he s covered in blood 
the cops find him in a train tunnel 
he s got the archbishop s ring on him 
  he stole the archbishop s ring 
  no  it was in his pocket 
is that it 
yep 
that s   
that s the worst bullshit story
i ve heard in my entire life 
now it s our bullshit story 
ok  let s get to work 
the name of the game is  motive  
the prosecution doesn t have one 
we have to prove that someone
else could have committed the crime 
then we can establish
reasonable doubt 
i want to know ever√Ωthing i can
about this guy 
go to database 
go to hall of records  irs files 
  even so called charities 
  so called  he was a priest 
naomi  write this down  b 32 1 56  it
was carved into the archbishop s chest 
  allegedly 
  no  that was a fact 
  but i appreciate the effort 
  thanks 
i also need case histories on murder
by stabbing  mutilation and religion 
  also i m gonna need a psychiatrist 
  you re telling me 
not the kind who lives
in a witness box  i need a real one 
  and an expert on amnesia 
  what does he look like in person 
the butcher boy 
  like a boy scout 
  a boy scout   
  with a merit badge in carving 
the archbishop was
a close friend of mr shaughnessy 
he asked me who my best man was 
  i said you 
  thank you 
i trust if i m to prosecute this case 
i ll get the authority
which comes with it 
you re the one trying the case 
but let s establish one thing
at the outset  i want the death penalty 
i d like to go over the case before we
determine whether or not to seek that 
i m open to anything you have to say 
but in my mind there s no debate 
did the boy they picked up
say anything 
yeah  he didn t do it 
  it s a slam dunk  janet 
  excuse me 
i appreciate your faith in me 
i don t mean to be argumentative 
  it s what we pay you for 
  open and shut  you don t need me 
the pd ll plead no contest and throw
the kid on the mercy of the court 
there s not a public defender 
he s got a lawyer  already  who 
hey  i m martin vail 
i m defending aaron stampler 
i need to inspect the murder site 
oh  the butcher boy  huh 
thank you  yes  i forgot his real name 
what s the matter  marty 
lost your faith 
looking for a little religion 
tell me  counsellor  which one of us
is the true headline chaser here 
  unlike you  i was assigned 
  yeah  and you re up to it 
sold the book rights  or will you wait 
wanna see some pictures 
they re kind of cute 
i think you ll agree they clearly show
the heinous nature of the crime 
small piece of advice  don t use
the word  heinous  in the courtroom 
half the jury won t know
what you mean 
small piece of advice  i m not
sitting second chair to you any more 
in case you hadn t noticed 
i graduated 
  i had no reason to leave 
  you had every reason to leave 
  how can you still work for them 
  you expect me to trot out after you 
quit just because you did 
i don t need a mercedes  i don t need
to see my face on the evening news 
you knew i was coming here 
didn t you 
you knew i would defend him 
that s why you took the case 
oh  please  what s the matter  marty 
are you nervous 
been a while since you rubbed up
against a woman with a brain 
what s the matter  you tired 
you haven t been sleeping well 
you re the one with the score to settle 
i sleep great at night 
cook county dept  of corrections
div  ix maximum security dormitory
thanks 
  hey  where is he 
  over here 
we ll be sitting at a table
with two of my associates 
once the charges are read 
the judge ll ask how you plead 
  not guilty 
  no 
but i m not guilty  mr vail 
it doesn t matter 
keep your mouth shut 
  are you gonna say i m not guilty 
  i ll say whatever i say  don t worry 
  but   
  this is what i mean 
this can t go on in the courtroom  get
used to it  i speak  you do not speak 
  your job is to sit and look innocent 
  i am innocent 
that s it  that s how i want you to look 
can you remember that 
look in the mirror if you have to 
i don t have to 
this is how i always look 
then you re way ahead
of the game already  aren t you 
don t smile 
don t 
  mr vail  can we have a statement 
  we re gonna find out what happened 
the only pressure is to find the truth 
you ve talked to the police  i told you
not to  they get ever√Ωthing wrong 
how will you explain
his blood soaked clothes 
i won t explain anything now 
i ve just been retained in this case 
significant facts are in dispute here
and continue to be so 
you re a master at putting the victim
on trial to help your client 
that ll be very difficult in this case 
the victim in this case is my client 
we have two victims here 
no suspects  thank you 
  you worried about his safety 
  no  thank you 
i don t think there s any question
about the verdict 
all rise 
good afternoon  ladies and gentlemen 
bailiff 
the state versus aaron stampler 
  is every    sit down  everyone here 
  yes  your honour 
madame prosecutor 
the state charges aaron stampler
with murder in the first degree 
how does your client plead 
if it pleases the court 
i need time to make
a psychiatric evaluation before
charges are brought against us 
the state has enough evidence
to warrant the allegations 
i agree  motion denied 
mr stampler 
  do you understand the charges 
  yes 
i direct my client not to answer that 
his response might incriminate him 
he is taking the fifth on whether
or not he understands the charges 
yes  until we have a complete
psychological evaluation 
he will be taking the fifth on any
and all questions posed to him 
the state versus appleby 
for your review on precedent 
thank you 
no  i can t do that  no 
what do you want 
i m looking for the room a kid named
aaron stampler stayed in 
  are you the police 
  i m his uncle 
well  hey 
  this is alex s 
  who s alex 
he s one of the other altar boys 
an altar boy 
an altar boy was wearing this 
well  not at mass 
this altar boy attacked a colleague
of mine and hurt him pretty bad 
what do you think he was doing
in your room 
i can t    i don t know 
i don t have nothing 
  you know where to find him 
  who  alex 
  no  i don t know where he is 
  you don t 
  who s linda 
  l linda 
is she your girlfriend 
where is she  i d like to talk to her 
i don t know where she is 
i get this feeling
you re not telling me something 
  i m telling you the truth 
  i don t think so 
are you surprised
that alex attacked my friend 
no  no  he has a temper 
yeah  i d say so 
do you think it could be alex
who was that figure you saw
at the archbishop s room 
i    alex  i couldn t be sure 
  but it could be him 
  i don t know 
you don t understand 
the state wants you dead 
you don t help me 
that s what they ll get 
i m trying  i can t remember 
i don t understand  why would alex
wanna do such a thing 
for his own reasons 
maybe someone hired him 
  hired by who 
  forget it 
do you think he s capable of doing it 
i don t know 
i don t know who s capable
of such a thing 
  oh  thanks 
  sure 
he claims there was someone else
in the room  and he can t remember 
you want me to look into this amnesia
question and see what he knows 
what if he knows he did it 
major causes of amnesia are 
substance abuse  seizures 
head injuries and malingering 
i think the kid is telling the truth 
ok  then let s get something straight 
i m happy to go in and analyse him 
in fact i m looking forward to it 
but i won t go in there
to validate a story  understood 
you do your job 
i do mine  yatta  yatta 
if i think it s necessary 
i d wanna get an mrl  eeg
and neuropsych testing 
  yes  doctor  good night 
  good night 
i ll be recording our meetings
for mr vail 
so it isn t as confidential as it would be
if you were consulting with the doctor 
he may even call me as a witness 
if you have any questions   
     you should raise them to him now 
  no  ma am  i understand 
good  so  ok  i think we ll be fine 
  i ll see you later 
  ok 
bye 
vail told me there s time surrounding
the death you don t remember 
  is that right 
  yes 
i lost the time 
i mean i blacked out 
  have you had blackouts before 
  yes  i have 
when s the first time
you remember them happening 
they started when i was about twelve 
were your parents aware
of what was happening to you 
n no  my m m mother was dead 
and your father 
no  no  he was not a nice man 
  did you seek treatment 
  did i what 
  did you see a doctor for them 
  oh 
no 
you don t go to a doctor in creekside
unless your leg s broken 
  hey  can i talk to you 
  talk 
excuse us  i ll bring her right back 
how dare you 
am i a chess piece you can
move around  i was having lunch 
when are we getting all the discovery 
  what do you want 
  i want to know when 
  i ve got motions to file 
  no  you don t 
you re looking to make a deal 
i have no authority to deal from
my client  what s your excuse 
if we needed to make a deal 
i have all the authority i want 
bullshit  shaughnessy wants the
whole shot  he s using you to get it 
deal this down
to murder with no death penalty 
deal down 
we have a fucking great case 
great case  lack of prior record  no
eye witness  no confession  no motive 
hard evidence  i assume you re not
going with insanity  which is a shame 
my shrinks would have torn him apart 
your pleading the fifth
on the charges was brilliant 
it was good  wasn t it  i liked it 
you lose this case  you take the fall 
not shaughnessy 
  talk to me 
  we re going to trial  marty 
all right  all it takes is one 
one juror who doesn t believe he did it 
one juror with a kid
who looks into that face   
that face is great  you prepping him
to take the stand 
that stutter is p p priceless 
oh  marty 
don t tell me you think he didn t do it 
has little aaron stampler
gotten to you 
we re not just talking about jail here 
but ending someone s life 
if you re wrong and shaughnessy s
made you do this  can you live with it 
i ll live 
see you in court 
we stipulate
that murder was done here 
so these photos
have no probative value 
this is not just murder 
it s mutilation and torture 
the prosecution wants to show them
to the jury for shock appeal 
not true  they clearly identify
the heinous nature of the crime 
and they connect the defendant  found
covered in blood  to the crime scene 
  prejudicial 
  i beg to differ 
counsel  please 
the photos are in  mr vail 
would you like a recess
to carry on with this in private 
i m sorry  your honour 
but this is too much 
next thing  he ll be objecting
if we bring in the murder weapon 
now that she brings it up   
this is a public building 
excuse me  mr vail 
would you sign this for me 
tell me about linda 
mr vail said she was your girlfriend 
yes  she was 
how did you meet 
well  we were both
at the savior house 
i was an altar boy  she was doing
work for bishop rushman 
  what was the relationship like 
  me and linda 
she is real cultural 
real cultural and very smart 
we had a nice time together 
we might get married 
were you sleeping together 
  well  that s private 
  i know  i have to ask the question 
were you having
a sexual relationship  aaron 
yes  we were 
were you sleeping with anyone else
at the time 
no 
was she 
has she been to see you  aaron 
  well  no  but   
  and that upsets you 
no  no  the thing is she went away 
she went away for a while 
she left before this happened 
i don t even think   
i don t even think she knows about it 
  yo  boss 
  hey  got something for me 
yeah 
there s nothing catalogued downtown
under the numbers b 321 56 
but i don t think the b is a b  it s an 8 
i think the knife slipped  8321 56 
thomas jefferson 
i don t think he did it 
this won t help  rushman s charities
and his foundation s investments 
nothing startling 
except how many there are 
wait a minute here 
what was he doing
with the south river deal  pull that up 
loading file
yeah  the investors 
shaughnessy 
that s joey pinero s neighbourhood 
see this lot here 
this all used to be houses 
in fact  there was a house in the corner
where i kissed my first girlfriend 
got her pregnant  too 
  hell of a kiss  joey 
  oh  yeah 
the neighbourhood will end up
high rent condos if they get their way 
that s why i ll buy back the lot
with the settlement you got me 
you heard about the money  right 
  who hasn t 
  marty s the best  man 
just doing my job 
1  500 000  he s just doing his job 
alderman  joey tells me a cop came
around  wanting him to set you up 
it s typical 
can t buy me 
so they try to buy a brother 
most people assume this land we re
walking on belongs to the railroad 
but it doesn t  it belongs to the church 
the church 
  so that s the rushman foundation 
  that s right 
  with a bunch of rich developers 
  including john shaughnessy 
they bought up land and buildings
around the church property
and tore them down 
our neighbourhood would disappear 
i went to the archbishop and said 
 what are you doing to these people  
 they re poor  they re getting
kicked out of their homes  
   and they re catholic  
  fucking a 
he listened  i couldn t believe it 
he told them to stop developing
around the church property 
the partners hold buildings they can t
demolish and land they can t build on 
shaughnessy loses millions 
  if i need you to  will you testify 
  who  me 
oh  yeah  easy 
just change out of this suit  put on
a brooks brothers with loafers and   
no  joey  not you 
sure 
i ll testify 
you know what people think 
that this great city runs itself 
they think it gets up  goes to work and
climbs into bed at night  like we do 
unaware of what it takes to make sure
it doesn t break down 
crime  fires  riots 
the water pipes bursting under
the city  what a mess that was 
and the water commissioner
calls the contractor who built it 
no  he calls me  they all call me 
goddamn  this is terrific 
they call me because i keep
the peace  that s my job 
this city doesn t burn
because i won t permit it 
i m the great negotiator 
you think people get that 
the truth is i don t care 
the dumb bastards don t even vote 
they just eat  sleep  watch tv
and occasionally fuck their wives 
guess we should all thank you 
you re welcome 
john  you need some new material 
i ve heard this great city speech
ten times already 
your boy pinero is not honouring
his side of the deal 
  is that what this dinner is about 
  in part 
i told him what the deal is 
he s a grown up  what else 
your assistant s been digging around
in the archbishop s finances 
yeah  well 
how much did you lose when he
pulled the plug from south river 
let me tell you something 
it s a mistake to stick your thumb in
the eyes of the city s most powerful 
it s not their eyes i m aiming for 
do not fuck with me  marty 
the pipes are bursting again  john 
in the most anticipated murder trial
in recent chicago history 
former state attorney prosecutor
martin vail will lead   
richard rushman was a man of god 
he spent his life giving
to the people of chicago 
he was a beacon ofinspiration 
not only as a spiritual leader   
   deliver his opening statement
tomorrow   
my name is martin vail  the reason
i m here  and the reason you re here 
is to make sure
the whole truth is known 
we can learn the truth
by talking about what the prosecution
does not want you to hear 
do not be fooled by the defendant s
innocent appearance and demeanour 
aaron stampler sat injudgment
ofarchbishop rushman
and determined
that not only should he die 
but he should die the most brutal   
we all saw aaron being arrested
minutes after the archbishop s death 
but why  because he was convenient
and the police were under pressure   
the evidence will show that aaron
stampler stalked  ambushed
and savagely murdered
this great man 
the prosecution doesn t want you
to hear about
the other altar boys who have
mysteriously disappeared 
at the close of evidence 
you will learn
that aaron stampler
had everything he needed
for the perfect assassination 
using this knife   
  aaron stampler repeatedly stabbed
at the archbishop s chest 
his genitals and his eyes 
they don t want you to hear
that the archbishop
invested on behalf
of the roman catholic church 
investments resulting in huge losses
for some very powerful people 
they don t want you to hear about the
20 death threats he received this year 
and they really don t want you
to hear about their theory of motive 
why is that  very simple 
they don t have one 
inspector woodside  explain to the
court where the sneakers came from 
they were taken off the defendant
when he was apprehended 
what was the result
of the blood stain analysis 
they proved to be human blood
matching the blood type and dna
characteristics of the archbishop 
what did the bloody footprints
surrounding the body tell you 
the killer left a pattern of footprints
around the area of the struggle 
as indicated by the spread of blood
through the room 
yes or no  inspector  could there have
been a third person in the quarters 
  there s no evidence to suggest that 
  no evidence proves there wasn t 
no 
what happened after the struggle 
our analysis suggests
the killer was startled and ran
from the bedroom and down the stairs 
is it possible  inspector   
that the real killer  the third person 
who maybe was smart enough not
to tramp a whole freeway of blood
through the whole place 
couldn t this third person have placed
the defendant s prints on the knife   
     while he was passed out 
  anything is possible 
clearly the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds 
yes  he did  78 
he tried to defend himself  that
explains cuts on hands and forearms 
doctor  isn t it a fact
that you can t be sure
whether more than one person inflicted
these 78 stab and incised wounds 
it could have been more than one 
but i doubt it 
from your analysis
of the knife wounds 
do you have an opinion whether
the killer was left or right handed 
the wounds to the throat
and most of the chest wounds
were made from an angle that strongly
suggests a left handed person 
  is the defendant left handed 
  yes  he is 
it s possible a right handed person
could have used his left hand 
yes  i suppose that s possible 
then it s reasonable to assume there
was a third person at the crime scene 
reasonable  no  but it is possible 
   then following opening statements
it was a day ofstrong testimony
from the prosecution s first witnesses 
forensics chiefharvey woodside
and medical examiner emile weil 
it was also tough cross examination
of woodside and weil
by stampler defence attorney
martin vail 
captain stenner  thank you
for the time you ve given us 
but finally  i d like to turn your attention
to the symbol carved into the chest 
would you please tell the jury
about that  captain 
yes  the letter and the numbers
b 32 1 56 were carved
into the archbishop s chest 
have you been able to find
an identical reference anywhere 
i believe so  yes 
the symbol b 32 1 56 is actually
catalogue code for a book
discovered in a private reading room
located in the church basement 
that particular number  the b 32 part 
refers to a book  the scarlet letter 
by nathaniel hawthorne 
when we opened the book
to page 1 56 
we discovered an underlined passage 
could you please read
this underlined passage to the court 
 no man  for any considerable period  
 can wear one face to himself
and another to the multitude 
 without finally getting bewildered
as to which may be the true  
thank you 
what does that passage mean to you 
objection  he s a policeman 
not an english professor 
his interpretation will be
speculative and irrelevant 
she didn t ask for an expert opinion 
witness can answer 
well  to me it s simple 
the killer thought his victim was
two faced  dishonest in some way 
in your experience  captain 
do killers ever intentionally
leave clues to their motive 
not often  but it happens 
thanks 
  thanks  man 
  yeah  sure 
did you underline that book 
  what 
  did you underline that book 
  no  mr vail 
  no 
no  mr vail  i never even opened
the scarlet letter 
i don t like hawthorne 
we had that one about the house with
the seven somethings in high school 
i couldn t even get past page 1 0 
i wasn t the only one
using bishop rushman s library 
everybody borrowed books
from bishop rushman 
he encouraged it  altar boys  staff 
everyone was in there 
guard 
you don t give up  do you 
  you didn t know anything about that 
  no 
  what about the impact

he did it  the little fuck did it 
how could i have missed that 
  am i gonna need stitches 
  no 
he didn t do it  aaron has no idea
what just happened in there 
i kept seeing the signs  the big ones 
abusive background  these repeated
blackouts  the ellipses in thought 
he s ambidextrous  i tried to tell you 
you may be thrilled by all this 
but i m fucked  i don t have a case 
textbook multiple personality disorder 
put me on the stand  i ll testify 
he s insane 
i can t  i can t change plea
in the middle of a trial 
the judge would never allow it 
insanity is the hardest thing to prove 
ok 
my professional opinion 
this is not a criminal
we re dealing with  he s a sick kid 
he s sitting in a cell 
and that s not where he belongs 
you got an aspirin 
come on  connerman  ask it 
ask what 
the question
you wanted to ask me before 
i don t understand  mr vail 
 how can you defend someone
if you know they did it  
 how can you defend these
fucking scumbags   isn t that it 
all those fucking coy questions 
all that bullshit 
bottom line is 
 how can you do what you do  
you think it s the money  don t you 
the money s nice 
the money s very  very nice  jack 
the first thing i ask a new client is 
 you been saving up for a rainy day  
 guess what  it s raining  
you think it s because i want to see
my face on magazine covers 
my 1 5 seconds on tv  i love it 
i fucking love that shit  i really do 
but guess what 
it s not it 
  you go to las vegas 
  yeah 
i don t go to vegas 
why don t i go to vegas 
marty  it s late 
i think we should just get up and   
why gamble with money when you
can gamble with people s lives 
that was a joke 
all right  i ll tell you 
i believe in the notion that people
are innocent until proven guilty 
i believe in that notion
because i choose to believe
in the basic goodness of people 
i choose to believe that not all crimes
are committed by bad people 
and i try to understand
that some very good people
do some very bad things 
you know when i was working
for shaughnessy 
i did something very  very bad 
illegal  i was a prosecutor then 
this thing i did  i was very upset by it
and decided to leave 
so i left 
i became a defending attorney 
the irony being that everyone
assumed i was lying anyhow 
i made myself this little promise that   
   l would reserve my lies
for other than my public life 
you print any of this 
i ll sue your fucking ass 
  all right  so i made a little mistake 
  no shit 
what do you want  a new suit 
i ll buy you a new suit 
you made a mistake 
you told us the third man did it 
you got your third man 
and a fourth man and a fifth man   
what are you going to do  marty 
i don t know  i really fucked up here 
you were right 
  so how are you gonna get him off 
  i don t know 
what i know is that aaron did
not commit first degree murder 
  he stabbed him a billion times   
  not aaron 
to convict someone of a capital crime
the state must prove intent 
  roy had intent  aaron didn t 
  then you have to plead insanity   
   which we can t do mid trial 
unless you plan a career change 
i could ve been mistaken 
but i wasn t wrong 
aaron is innocent 
it s roy who is guilty 
he doesn t need a lawyer 
he needs an exorcist 
you re full of shit 
you weren t there  you didn t see it 
he s one sick boy who s been fucked
around by his father  by his priest 
it s our job to make sure the jury
believes he doesn t deserve to die 
  ok 
  ok  how do we do it 
by somehow introducing
this whole abuse thing 
  the tape 
  that s crazy  that gives him motive 
no  it looks like that  but it s   
no  actually 
it turns this whole thing around 
it gives concrete documentation
of what rushman did to this kid 
but we can t put it in  you know that 
but we re not going to 
oh  fuck 
  ok 
  good 
what the hell are you doing 
you know damn well who it is 
  barleycorn s  marty  now 
  janet 
cute porno  part of your collection 
hey 
where did you get it  steal it 
  from the crime scene 
  i don t know anything   
  you are such a liar 
  think about it 
if it contains that 
i wouldn t give it to you  it s motive 
you had to give it to me 
if you introduced it  the jury d despise
you for dishonouring the bishop 
if you get me to show it  motive or
no motive  i m the one who looks bad 
and you gain sympathy
for your poor  little  abused boy 
  you think so 
  i hate you 
don t use it 
i have no intention of using it 
  the usual  stu 
  you got it 
  you re up to even more than that 
  i m not up to anything 
you re opening a door for me with
a tiger on the other end  and i don t   
you know who you d really upset 
shaughnessy 
  fuck him 
  fuck him 
fuck you 
thanks a lot 
  if this is not your motive  what is 
  i have motive 
yeah  what is it 
i m really gonna tell you 
better tell the jury soon 
time s running out 
here you go 
you think you ve got me  huh 
you think because you know me as
well as you do  you know how i think 
well  i know how you think 
you know what i m thinking 
what happened to your face 
i    i bumped it
in a medicine cabinet 
no  that was a girl on her way out 
  we should come back here later 
  they close in ten minutes 
no  after 
after the trial 
when we got nothing to lose 
how can your timing
be so good in a courtroom
and so bad in real life 
i ll think about it later 
i hate you too much right now 
you got a visitor 
here she comes 
talk to you later

  your honour  may i approach 
  yes  you may 
my client is on trial for his life  he
maintains there was a third person 
can mr shaughnessy confirm that 
the us constitution

and profound in brady vs  maryland 
mr shaughnessy  you sit on the board
of the rushman foundation 
i am an honorary board member 
explain the nature
and purpose of this foundation 
it was founded by the late archbishop 
its purpose is to invest in projects
for the greater good of the community 
the greater good of the community 
ok 
would that be true
in the case of the now bankrupt   
     south river housing development 
  yes 
could you tell the court why the south
river project was abandoned 
there was a difference of opinion
as to the costs 
wasn t there also
a difference of opinion
between the investors
and the late archbishop 
  i don t recall 
  you don t   
what kind of money
are we talking about 
how much money was invested
in this failed south river enterprise 
  60 million dollars 
  quiet 
60 million dollars 
wow  that s a lot of money 
you and the archbishop
have been friends for 20 years 
  you knew each other well 
  that s right 
  did that tape s content surprise you 
  yes  of course 
you ve never heard any allegations
against the archbishop 
not that i recall  no 
especially since you were state s
attorney for the last 1 5 years 
you ve supervised all prosecutions
in cook county during that time 
especially the prosecutions
of prominent figures 
i also have a staff of
a thousand of the best prosecutors   
as state s attorney
it was up to you  ultimately  to decide   
     who would be indicted 
  yes 
let me just take you back now 
let s go back to june 1 985 
do you recall any allegations
of sexual misconduct   
     against the archbishop then 
  i don t recall that  no 
do you recall a young man
by the name of michael o donnell
who came to the felony review unit
at your office 
i have no idea
what you re talking about 
that s confusing because a document
from the chicago metropolitan police
says that michael o donnell spoke
to the supervisor for two weeks 
explaining sexual abuse he suffered
at the hands of archbishop rushman 
isn t it also true  mr state s attorney 
that you then decided that your friend
was not going to stand trial
for any of it 
he owed you big time  john 
you must have been pissed off
when he pulled out of south river 
he just said   i can t take it any more  
he said   no  
you and your investors
had 60 million reasons to kill him 
  you little cocksucker 
  that s it  witness dismissed 
  vail  in my chambers now 
  that s for joey pinero  shithead 
start looking for a job 
you think you can use my courtroom to
wage vendettas and settle old scores 
you are sorely mistaken 
i m striking shaughnessy s testimony
from the record as irrelevant 
and i m holding you in contempt
to the tune of 1 0 000 dollars 
you re saying that i can t get
a fair trial in your courtroom 
be very careful  mr vail 
you re on dangerous ground 
you want the cheque
made out to you 
you want me to take you off this case 
you re making a mockery of
my courtroom  and i won t allow it 
i suggest you start representing your
client and stop representing yourself 
  can we do this later 
  no  i want to stay with this 
  i m feeling very  very tired 
  yeah  i know 
why does talking
about linda forbes upset you 
it doesn t  ijust   
  ok 
  i m sorry  i m sorry 
  you know what i can do with this 
  how the fuck should i know 
dr arrington  how much time
have you spent with aaron stampler 
  around 60 hours 
  what did you find in your evaluation 
mr stampler suffers from
an acute disassociative condition 
  multiple personality disorder 
  objection  your honour 
she s only stating
what she s personally observed 
  your honour 
  counsellors 
  i know what you re doing 
  excuse us for a minute 
if he wants to question
his client s sanity   
i m trying to establish
a medical basis for amnesia 
that s not what he s doing 
he s saying he s crazy 
  are you 
  no  i am not 
i ll allow you to proceed
with this witness if you re very careful 
absolutely  yes 
write down that he said that 
all right  where were we 
now  could aaron stampler
have been present during the murder
of archbishop rushman   
     and not remember it 
  yes  he could 
could you explain that  please 
stampler s state was such that his
body could be present at a homicide 
and yet his mind
would be unable to recall it 
  how would this be possible 
  this neurological mechanism   
   began with the early abuse
suffered at the hands of his father 
in defence aaron s psyche splintered
into two separate personalities 
  your honour 
  i didn t say it  i did not say it   
you ve been warned twice 
you wanna pursue this 
and i suggest you think long and hard
before answering 
your honour  just one last question 
all right  dr arrington   
   in your opinion is aaron stampler
capable of murder 
no  he s far too traumatised to
express normal anger and frustration 
he keeps his emotions repressed 
which is why he created roy 
who is capable   
  objection 
  that s enough  mr vail 
the jury will disregard this witness 
last statement  as will the court 
  prosecutor  do you wish to cross 
  you bet i do 
since you brought it up 
against the instructions of the court 
is multiple personality disorder
your primary area of expertise 
it s not my primary field  no 
is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise 
  no  i m a neuropsychologist 
  i see 
so you have no forensic experience
and you re more of an academic 
then you will forgive
this rather academic question 
i m driving  somebody cuts me off 
i feel like killing this guy 
but i don t  now do l 
  i would hope not 
  that s right 
things happen to us 
people wrong us 
but we don t all invent psychopaths
to do our dirty work for us  doctor 
i m not suggesting
you have multiple personalities 
  i m saying mr stampler does 
  yes  i know  we heard 
you have also testified that you have
met this    what was his name again 
  roy 
  roy what 
  he didn t give a last name 
  i see 
did this roy tell you
that he had murdered the archbishop 
mr vail was with him  i was outside 
but soon after i was in the room
and saw both roy
and his transformation back to aaron 
did you happen to tape
this appearance of aaron    
oh  i m sorry 
i just cannot get used to this name 
  roy 
  did you 
  no  the tape was off 
  off 
so you have no record whatsoever
of his appearance 
  no 
  no 
  does aaron know right from wrong 
  yes  he does 
  if aaron butchered the archbishop   
  objection 
   would he know
if aaron murdered the archbishop 
  would he know he d broken the law 
  yes  he would  but it wasn t aaron   
oh  yes  i know  doctor  it was roy 
that s all 
no further questions  your honour 
witness may step down 
if you d like to re open your case
and call the state s psychiatrist   
     l will certainly agree to it 
  no  l   
i don t think that s necessary 
i think we all get the picture here 
mr vail  are you ready to proceed 
would you like a recess 
roy 
aaron 
could you tell us a little about
your relationship with the archbishop 
well  he was like a father to me 
i loved him very much 
why did you love him 
  why 
  aha 
well  he   he s saved my life 
he was the only person who ever
treated me like i was worth anything 
stop your whining  little girl  be a man 
we ve all seen that tape
that you were in  aaron 
how did that make you feel  did it
change your feelings about rushman 
no 
he was a wonderful man 
so you didn t feel anger towards him
for forcing you to perform in that tape 
no  he did ever√Ωthing for me 
there was nothing else
i could do for him  and he needed it 
do you know someone named roy 
no  i don t 
you heard dr arrington s testimony
about what she and i saw at the jail 
there are strange things going on 
do you remember 
i heard what she said 
but i don t remember any of that 
did you kill archbishop rushman 
no  sir  i did not 
thank you 
your witness 
mr stampler 
would you like some water 
  n no  ma am 
  you sure 
ye yes  ma am 
mr stampler  did you believe
that the archbishop wore masks 
i m sorry  what did you say 
do you think he acted one way
in public and another way in private 
n no  i don t think that 
isn t that why you underlined
the hawthorne passage 
mr stampler 
no  i did not underline that book 
  you didn t underline it 
  no  ma am 
and you didn t carve the numbers
of that passage into his chest 
no  ma am  i did not 
i told you l   
you loved him 
you loved him like a father 
even though
he made you and your girlfriend
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification 
no  you don t understand  he   
there was no other way for him
to cast out his demons  he   
he needed to get off  aaron 
that s what he was doing 
that s what he needed you for 
to perform like a circus animal 
  that was your function in his life 
  n no 
oh  mr stampler  i m gonna ask
you straight because i am tired 
i ve had enough of this sordidness 
and i wanna go home 
and i wanna wash my hands 
and i wanna forget all about you
and archbishop rushman 
did the archbishop force you
and your girlfriend and others
to perform sexual acts
while he watched  yes or no 
  yes  he did  but   
  yes  yes  he forced you 
he forced you using a threat
of expulsion from savior house
and a life on the street with no heat
and no water and no food 
he put you in front of a camera 
he made you take off your clothes 
and you don t think
that s another side 
another face of a man
that we all thought   
  no  no 
  someone did that to me  i d kill him 
i would stab him 78 times
with a butcher knife 
i would chop off his fingers 
i would slash his throat open 
i would carve numbers into his chest 
i would gouge out his eyes  i swear 
but that s me 
  no further questions 
  where the hell are you going 
look at me
when i m talking to you  bitch 
fuck you  lady  come here 
order  bailiff  order 
let s play rough  come on  back off 
  roy 
  keep coming  and i ll break her neck 
  come here and talk 
  fuck you  marty  i m walking out 
no  no  don t you     
you ok 
don t even think of lighting
that cigarette  miss venable 
  how s your neck 
  i ll live 
i could call a doctor 
mr shaughnessy just called
to inform me there will be no mistrial 
  as if that was his right 
  i can t believe   
   that scumbag has the balls to call 
no thanks 
what matters to me is what you have
to say  your case has been damaged 
in fairness to the prosecution
i would declare a mistrial 
regardless of what shaughnessy
and vail think  if that s what you want 
the prosecution doesn t wanna try
this case again even if it could 
which it can t  at least not by me 
i think i can guarantee you
there s no one
in the da s office who will 
so   it s up to you 
i m gonna dismiss the jury
in favour of a bench trial
and a blind plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity  yes 
the defendant will be remanded
to elgin for a 30 day evaluation period 
let them decide
the term of his commitment 
  do you have a problem with that 
  he ll be out in a month 
take it up with the legislature 
miss venable 
i m going home 
  your honour 
  no  i won t refund your contempt fine 
next time you wanna get a client off
on insanity  you plead that way 
or i ll have you disbarred
