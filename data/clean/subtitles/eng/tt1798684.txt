commentator no aggression
simply a will to continue
taking punishment

commentator and to allow turay
to pound him with both fists
to the body and the head
ending it now
commentator
but its been a bloodletting
from the first bell onward

commentator
hope finally gets in a right hand
crowd booing
those have been few and far between
by and large

suspension is up for review
which means zero income
the fine for the assault on a referee
will be in the six figures

and emotional trauma
theyre freezing all your
bank accounts immediately
and to top that off the networks are
suing us for breach of contract man

shuttle all right
i need to see the pivot
time
tick come on
grunting
yelling
hello again im jim lampley
along with the poundforpound
king of the 90s roy jones
here in las vegas at caesars palace
as we welcome you live to our coverage
of the light heavyweight title showdown
between existing
titlist miguel escobar
door opens
and former champion billy hope
roy throughout the boxing world
theres hope
you cant avoid saying it
that this evening could produce
a great story
of redemption for billy hope
whos been through so much
but realistically
what chance is there that hope
could come back and win
against such a skilled and effective
young champion as escobar
jones jr
the cards are stacked against hope
um his age um
the fact that hes been off
and this guy is probably
the best fighter
that will ever be put in front of hope
crowd cheering
lampley billy hope entering first
with no entry music
flanked by his new trainer tick wills
the ultimate revenge motive
for hope tonight
is that in his heart he believes
hes avenging the death of his
wife in a bizarre incident
in which escobar was involved
an incident for which no perpetrator
has ever paid the price
what about the choice
of walking with no music roy
jones jr anytime youve got
a crowd of this magnitude
and so much energy in one building
really you dont need music
lampley billy hope in the sixweek
buildup to this fight
has kept saying
all business all business
this isnt about all that other stuff
its just about were going to fight
man indistinct over pa
announcer the king of kings
and here comes miguel escobar
escobar is a product of colombia
in the past roy jones
when we spoke about fighters
from colombia
almost always they were big punchers
this is a different story
jones jr yeah
this is a whole different story
not often do we talk
about colombian fighters
and talk about the full package
most of them come with an astronomical
amount of punching power
but not skills to match that
tonight we have a guy
who is just as good
offensively skillwise
as he is powerful
i said more recently sergio martinez
but carlos melzon was a beast
but this kid is a boxerpuncher
with great speed great power
something to see jim
hes no champ
lampley and escobar now promoted
by jordan mains
the man who architected
billy hopes career
bell clangs
audience cheering
you have a good fight
i only gave him six weeks to train
jon jon
yeah
slip it off
you dont have to watch it
if you dont want to you okay
lampley and if the defection
of jordan mains werent enough
hopes longtime trainer
eli frost trains escobar
against him tonight
okay gentlemen you both received
your instructions in the dressing room
okay i want a good clean fight
obey my commands at all times
above all
protect yourself at all times
lets go
lampley tony weeks says
he wants a good clean fight
quite a number of ring observers
expect thats the last thing we
have any chance of seeing here
given the rising tide of emotions
bell clanging
in both corners as round one begins
go billy
lampley logic tells you
that in the casting of this fight
escobar is the superior boxer
billy hope the more physical brawler
you have to make him miss
make him miss
man come on son
and early on escobar getting
off but hope comes back
there you go
go to body shots go to
the body go to the body
come on apply that pressure
put it on him now
escobar with the showboat look at him
jones jr trying to take
billys confidence
come on billy now come on
lampley escobar energetic
bouncing on his feet
jones jr escobar seems
to be able to get
anything that he wants he can hit him
with a straight right he can
hit him with a left hook
nice slip nice slip
lampley billy hope already with
a mark above the left eye
hes holding ref hes holding
let him go i got you let him go
bell clanging
escobar is hitting him
and tony weeks steps in in the corner
you didnt see that

let me see let me see
lampley it appears that escobar
has drawn blood
right here in round one
well hope did his best
to make escobar pay in round one
what he wasnt able to do
was make him miss
hes a fast motherfucker
thats all right thats all right
you faster
dont worry about that
just do what we worked on
you make him miss
make him pay all right
lampley by now fans well aware of the
difficult passage
hope has been through
the loss of everything really
that was valuable to him
including the loss
for a period of time
of his hunger to fight
bell clanging
come on billy
lampley round two begins and its hope
whos the aggressor at the beginning
now escobar counters back
your defense come on
jones jr and billys doing
just the opposite of what
a boxer is supposed to do
youre supposed to hit and not get hit
billy is not hitting and getting
the hell knocked out of him
come on billy move

lampley early on
it looks like escobars jab
is too quick for billy hope
escobar working downstairs and up
following the body shots
with hard punches upstairs
bell clangs

before tony separated them
come on baby you got this
