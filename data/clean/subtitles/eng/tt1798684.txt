   it was a beat down
by kalil turay 
who appears to have scored

mr  hope will follow a case plan
that the court has designed 
said plan will include
individual counseling 
as well as sobriety
and anger management classes

into the care of the family services 
until which time
the father can demonstrate
the abilities to perform duties
of a responsible parent

tick  come on 
 grunting 
 yelling 
hello again  i m jim lampley 
along with the pound for pound
king of the  90s  roy jones 
here in las vegas at caesar s palace   
as we welcome you live to our coverage
of the light heavyweight title showdown
between existing
titlist miguel escobar   
 door opens 
and former champion billy hope 
roy  throughout the boxing world 
there s hope   
you can t avoid saying it   
that this evening could produce
a great story
of redemption for billy hope 
who s been through so much 
but realistically 
what chance is there that hope
could come back and win
against such a skilled and effective
young champion as escobar 
jones jr  
the cards are stacked against hope 
um  his age  um 
the fact that he s been off 
and this guy is probably
the best fighter
that will ever be put in front of hope 
 crowd cheering 
lampley  billy hope  entering first 
with no entry music 
flanked by his new trainer  tick wills 
the ultimate revenge motive
for hope tonight 
is that in his heart  he believes
he s avenging the death of his
wife in a bizarre incident
in which escobar was involved 
an incident for which no perpetrator
has ever paid the price 
what about the choice
of walking with no music  roy 
jones jr   anytime you ve got
a crowd of this magnitude
and so much energy in one building 
really  you don t need music 
lampley  billy hope  in the six week
build up to this fight 
has kept saying 
 all business  all business 
 this isn t about all that other stuff 
 it s just about we re going to fight  
 man indistinct over pa 
announcer     the king of kings 
and here comes miguel escobar 
escobar is a product of colombia 
in the past  roy jones 
when we spoke about fighters
from colombia 
almost always  they were big punchers 
this is a different story 
jones jr   yeah 
this is a whole different story 
not often do we talk
about colombian fighters
and talk about the full package 
most of them come with an astronomical
amount of punching power 
but not skills to match that 
tonight we have a guy
who is just as good
offensively  skill wise 
as he is powerful 
i said  more recently  sergio martinez 
but carlos melzon was a beast 
but this kid is a boxer puncher
with great speed  great power   
something to see  jim 
he s no champ 
lampley  and escobar now promoted
by jordan mains 
the man who architected
billy hope s career 
 bell clangs 
 audience cheering 
you have a good fight 
i only gave him six weeks to train 
  jon jon 
  yeah 
slip it off 
you don t have to watch it
if you don t want to  you okay 
lampley  and if the defection
of jordan mains weren t enough 
hope s longtime trainer 
eli frost  trains escobar
against him tonight 
okay  gentlemen  you both received
your instructions in the dressing room 
okay  i want a good  clean fight 
obey my commands at all times 
above all 
protect yourself at all times 
let s go 
lampley  tony weeks says
he wants a good  clean fight 
quite a number of ring observers
expect that s the last thing we
have any chance of seeing here 
  given the rising tide of emotions   
   bell clanging 
   in both corners as round one begins 
go  billy 
lampley  logic tells you
that in the casting of this fight 
escobar is the superior boxer 
billy hope the more physical brawler 
you have to make him miss 
make him miss 
man  come on  son 
and early on  escobar getting
off  but hope comes back 
there you go 
go to body shots  go to
the body  go to the body 
come on  apply that pressure 
put it on him now 
escobar with the showboat  look at him 
jones jr   trying to take
billy s confidence 
come on  billy  now  come on 
lampley  escobar energetic 
bouncing on his feet 
jones jr   escobar seems
to be able to get
anything that he wants    he can hit him
with a straight right  he can
hit him with a left hook   
nice slip  nice slip 
lampley  billy hope already with
a mark above the left eye 
he s holding  ref  he s holding 
let him go  i got you  let him go 
   bell clanging 
  escobar is hitting him 
and tony weeks steps in  in the corner 
you didn t see that 
you didn t see that 
let me see  let me see 
lampley  it appears that escobar
has drawn blood
right here in round one 
well  hope did his best
to make escobar pay in round one 
what he wasn t able to do
was make him miss 
he s a fast motherfucker 
that s all right  that s all right 
you faster 
don t worry about that 
just do what we worked on 
you make him miss 
make him pay  all right 
lampley  by now  fans well aware of the
difficult passage
hope has been through   
the loss of everything  really 
that was valuable to him 
including the loss 
for a period of time 
of his hunger to fight 
   bell clanging 
  come on  billy 
lampley  round two begins  and it s hope
who s the aggressor at the beginning 
now escobar counters back 
  your defense  come on 
  jones jr   and billy s doing
just the opposite of what
a boxer is supposed to do 
you re supposed to hit and not get hit 
billy is not hitting  and getting
the hell knocked out of him 
come on  billy  move
your head  move your head 
lampley  early on 
it looks like escobar s jab
is too quick for billy hope 
escobar working downstairs and up 
following the body shots
with hard punches upstairs 
 bell clangs 
jones jr   good exchange right there
before tony separated them 
come on  baby  you got this 
watch that right  just keep the pace 
use your speed  work your way inside 
man  let s go  billy 
don t give up  boy 
lampley  first couple rounds
seem to have gone escobar s way 
let s see if hope can raise his
energy level and make it more of a fight 
move your head  move your head 
keep  keep him up 
 crowd cheering 
 bell clangs 
lampley  high time for hope
to begin working to the body
and try to turn things around 
three left hooks to the ribcage 
escobar catches him with a right 
down goes hope 
first knockdown of the fight 
   three  four 
  man  get up  baby 
  five    six   
get up  get up 
lampley 
that left eye is bleeding freely 
 bell clangs 
you all right  you okay 
all right  sit down 
no  no  no  his eye 
he s hurt 
lampley  and it looks already as though
things may be slipping away
from billy hope 
tick  you got to keep
the pressure on  baby 
don t worry about the eye 
i got the eye 
lampley  that s a
gruesome looking left eye   
angela  if there was a problem 
they would stop the fight 
there s not a problem  okay 
  how s it look  doc 
  i can see 
he s all right  he s all right 
yeah  he s good to go  good to go 
lampley  well  hope s fans would say
it wouldn t be billy
if he weren t bleeding 
show him  it s time to show him  baby 
  time to show him this time 
   bell clangs 
lampley  back in the center of the ring 
hope unloading right hand leads 
  come on  billy  show up 
  lampley  hope trying to tuck
that injured left eye
behind his front shoulder 
jones jr   and tick must be like
his freddie roach to miguel cotto 
because tick has done
a great job with his defense 
almost as though  roy 
billy hope didn t show up again
till the blood started to flow
from that left eye 
now billy s showing up  jim 
i have never seen billy hope
block a punch 
this is unbelievable  look at him 
nice 
what a good three punch combination
out of the shoulder roll right there 
from billy hope 
tick  come on  billy 
lampley

 crowd cheering

the 12 round fight in las vegas 
now they re even  hope bleeding

escobar bleeding from above the right 
 bell clangs 
hope mounting more and more offense now 
and now he fires back
with a big right hand 
  eli  we got this  we got this 
  lampley  and they re working hard
to keep that right eye together
for escobar  in his corner
