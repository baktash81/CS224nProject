i didnt notice them before
thats crazy i didnt know
buzzards fly at night
thats what they look like
here
boy thats some dead burg
buzzards only come
when somethings dead
well i guess we better
go in and have a look
this is caper one to vandal deca
caper one to vandal deca
are you reading over
yes im reading over
were about to enter
the town of piedmont
and recover the satellite
very good caper one
leave your radio open
roger
were now inside the town
its kind of spooky
i see a church steeple
ahead on the left
its quiet here
its the damndest thing
theres no sign of life
the signals from the satellite
are getting very strong
sir you see that lieutenant
see what crane
over by the fence
it looks like a body
easy crane
youre imagining things
holy
sir its another one
youre right it looks dead
yes sir shall i
no stay in the van
vandal deca to caper one
whats happening
we see bodies lots of them
are you certain caper one
damn it com roe
of course were certain
your orders are proceed
to satellite and retrieve
roger vandal deca
stay at your stations
hit that security button
get me major manchek
somehow they dont
hardly look dead lieutenant
theyre all over the place
must be dozens of them
damn it get this call through
its sort of like they just
dropped in their tracks sir
sir
good chri
do you see that thing in white
yeah its coming toward us
major this may sound crazy
but theres something strange
going on with caper one
sir i think we should get out of h
hello ops this is major manchek
scoop control a12
we need a flyby over
piedmont new mexico
infrared a fllr scan all sectors
film to come direct to scoop
assign gunner wilson
if hes not crocked someplace
jeez
im declaring a state of emergency
all personnel restricted to base
everything seen and heard
in that room is top secret
yes sir
this is a recording
state your name and
your message and hang up
major arthur manchek
scoop mission control a12
i recommend calling a wildfire alert
we have evidence here on film
of unnatural death caused by
scoop 7 returning to earth
time check 0147 inclusive
wed like to see dr jeremy stone please
well im mrs stone
we are having a party may i
does that man have a gun
maam we must see dr stone
what is this
please call dr stone to the door
otherwise well go get him
just a minute
ill just wait here maam
ill come to berkeley anytime stone
that 4 million must be
your largest federal grant
may i see you jeremy
the sds has arrived no doubt
jeremy there are some
army types in the hall
and two more outside with guns
they want to see you
ill take care of it
jeremy if you knew about this
you mightve told
i didnt ill explain later
im dr stone
yes im captain morton
theres a fire sir
ive got to leave
for gods sakes jeremy
when will you be back
im not sure
the guns is it
mrs stone its our job
to protect your husband
from now on nothing must
be allowed to happen to him
ill be safe as in your arms
jeremy jeremy
you tell the senator its his daughter
allison
dad something very
peculiar has just happened
even for jeremy
a few minutes ago
dad are you there
whats going on
this communication
is being monitored the connection
has been broken for reasons
of national security
you will be briefed
at the appropriate time
thank you for your cooperation mrs stone
i feel like onassis
it was the fastest thing
we could arrange sir
thanks
yes
general sparks here
i just wanted to inform you
that all members of your
team have been cleared
and are now being called in
except for professor kirke
hes in the hospital appendectomy
youll get complete
details on everything
when your team is assembled
you dont make sense
you talk like youve been brainwashed
you dont understand
germ warfare people dad
a lab accident
thank you
its different this time
dont pack claire
i wont need anything
a hippie hes going to a lovein
i give up
one minute youre fed up
you talk about retiring to alaska yet
now youve turned into
a cloakanddagger man
my glasses
here they are dad
cant you at least tell me who phoned
at this ungodly hour
grandpa theres a car
and they got guns
do they now
well thats serious
ill watch out
honey youve been dreaming
i wish i were
no uhuh
get someone else
dr leavitt i told you theres a fire
my experiments at the critical stage
ive been working around the clock
i cant just leave now
i want that new plate read
as soon as its developed
yes maam
my orders come from dr robertson
the presidents science
advisor in washington
theres a phone pick it up
call robbie
tell him i burnt my draft card
are you sick maam
we have a physician on call
all dr leavitt needs is rest
knock it off bess
if the physician certifies that
you are unable to continue
no
im fine
relax
im going with you
skin knife
hold it mark
sorry to disturb you
theres just been a call
from a dr robertson
at the white house
your orders are to break scrub
orders ive got a patient all ready
kelly will take over for you
its all arranged
youre expected in the
surgeons room in 30 seconds
are you sure the satellite
isnt radioactive
no manchek showed me
the telemetry reports
presumably it could be
some form of space germ
presumably this stuff is nonporous
why did you pick me
youre an md a talented surgeon
who knows blood chemistries
and youre single
the odd man hypothesis
what the hell is that
didnt you read the wildfire material
ive been sending you
very little
i never went in much
for science fiction
nor do i
it seems to me general
dr stone put one over on you
in fact he made us all think
his wildfire lab could handle
contamination from outer space
i disagree with the senator from vermont
dr stone a nobel prize winner
twice president of the
national academy of sciences
is well known here in washington
is the implication that dr stone
deliberately misled us
perhaps not deliberately senator
im reasonably certain
that before the night
the wildfire team was mobilized
dr stone didnt know scoop existed
im astounded
reasons of national security
very smart
weve had experiences
with scientists before
now lets talk about
this famous letter
dr stone sent to the president
some two years ago
from what youre saying
it was just a shot in the dark
perhaps thats a little unfair senator
dr stone and i were
consultants with nasa
on the lunar receiving lab
he wasnt completely satisfied
he felt a more advanced
lab was required
you mean more expensive dont you
i call that dr stones 90 million
mash note to uncle sam
in a true biological crisis
which our exploration of
space could bring about
the present lunar receiving laboratory
might prove inadequate
i therefore urge
the establishment of a facility
to deal specifically
with an extraterrestrial form of life
the purpose of this facility
would be to limit the dissemination
of such an unknown organism
from outer space
and to provide laboratories
for its analysis
i recommend that this facility be located
in an uninhabited region
of the united states
that it utilize all known
isolation techniques
and that it be equipped
with a nuclear device
for selfdestruction in the event
of an emergency
yours very truly jeremy stone
dont encourage the president
to think scientists are wizards
if things get out of control
and they might
even you cant work miracles
id expect to have
your help charlie
piedmont approaching gentlemen
go over and give us a look first dempsey
i was afraid of that
the birdsll eat the infected flesh
and then fly off and
spread the disease
if it is a disease
drop the gas canisters
someones supposed to be alive down there
somebody did something
thats for sure
lets give it a double dose
that gas will only kill the birds
okay dempsey hover
over the main street
and drop the ladder
do not attempt to land
is that clear
roger clearer all the time
when we climb down
lift off to 1000 feet
and hover at a safe distance
and come back when we signal
if anything happens to us
you have your orders
yes sir proceed directly
to wildfire and then
if were eliminated
the aircraft and pilot
will have to be sterilized
wait a minute
thats not what they told me
just incinerated
coronary
i doubt it
hall
take a look at this
are you sure that isnt coronary
no coronarys painful
they should grimace
if it was fast they wouldnt have time
fast these people were
cut down in midstride
up there look
an air force jet
if we dont make it to wildfire
hell see the helicopter does
or shoot it down
well for dempseys sake
we better not slip up
the day of judgment is at hand
have mercy on my soul
and to hell with all
the others amen
senile
this took time
regardless of what made her do it
it took time
theres a chance someones still alive
i wouldnt believe you could
commit suicide that way
most of them died instantly
but a few had time
to go quietly nuts
lets find the damn satellite
this injury there isnt any bleeding
a cut like this torn veins
broken capillaries
should bleed like hell
yes well theres no blood
on any of them
even where its chewed no bleeding
hold it hold it
youd better back up
we gotta go to the left
were damn close bear right
ill bet they took it to the doctor
there it is
the damn fool opened it
yeah every country doctor
should run his office
like the lunar lab
the capsule first hall
weve got about 40
minutes of oxygen left
have a look at his buttocks
thats not funny
not meant to be
normally blood in a dead person
goes to the lowest points
there should be marks of lividity
do you see purplish marks on his butt
no
careful you dont puncture your suit
clotted blood
powdered
ill be damned
no wonder they didnt bleed
its clotted throughout
the entire system
five quarts of blood
turned to powder
in theory i suppose
a single organism could do it
but in fact there isnt
an organism on earth
you mean there didnt used to be
i dont
we heard it all right
go away go back
get back get out
of here go back
get away
this must be the mother
hes scared and hungry as hell
cant be more than six months
theres probably a
formula in the kitchen
dont feed it
he hasnt eaten in
at least 12 hours
we dont do anything
until we get that kid
into a controlled situation
maybe feeding is part
of the disease process
maybe those who hadnt
eaten lasted longest
whatever it is with
our oxygen running out
we cant take a chance
wait a minute
this is a major break
a survivor
too bad he cant tell
us what happened
maybe he can if he lives
you
you you did it
give me that knife
youre not human
everybodys dead
what happened
what is it
what happened
the town is finished
contaminated beyond all
careful sir
this is an open transmission
im aware of that manchek
order up a 712
only the president
precisely get on it
the town must be
neutralized immediately
has the president made his decision
on directive 712 yet
he doesnt jump into
things dr robertson
first ive got to put together
a briefing for him
the presidents main concern is
the international consequences
what do you think mr secretary
its against the moscow treaty of 1963
to fire thermonuclear
weapons above ground
the russians will have
to be privately informed
were going to cauterize the area
then theyll ask a flock of questions
some we dont want answered
thatll take hours
god knows how far the infection
can spread in that time
yes chief
yes sir
yes mr president
the presidents decided
to postpone directive 712
for 24 to 48 hours
instead hell call
out the national guard
to cordon off the area around piedmont
thats your department ed
safe and sound
it shouldve been left up
to the scientists
its a colossal mistake
tell the president i said so
no but
ill get you an appointment
by whose decision general
was the site for wildfire chosen
dr stones
it seemed ideal because
of its remoteness
there was no inhabited area
near wildfire for a
radius of 112 miles
las vegas is to the north
phoenix to the south
los angeles west
werent you worried
the infection might spread to them
yes sir i was
but dr stone and dr robertson
assured the president
wildfire was foolproof
because of its device
for atomic selfdestruct
the military had to
take a backseat
at least they couldve
sent a licensed driver
to meet me at that crummy airstrip
they keep personnel to a minimum
for obvious reasons
youre lost
no ones been down
this goat path for years
thats how its supposed to look
they spent 50000 on it
putting in the potholes
getting rid of the tread marks
those big tractors leave
a lasting impression
a lot of heavy equipment
has passed this way
wheres our leader
well catch up to him
and hall very soon now
whyd they pick hall
hes no scientist
who needs an overpriced m d
relax and enjoy your cigarette
its your last
it starts here
its a great place to grow pot
just a plain old crop of barley
still it is rather clever i think
something wrong
i never liked red lights
reminds me of my years in a bordello
howdy
howdydodee
you got the time
my watch stopped at 1146
darn shame
must be the heat
its no fake believe me
when i retire
id like an agricultural
station like this in alaska
you a sourdough
hmph the sourest this way
step in
cute
the whole thing
what a world were making
i can see why the kids are dropping out
we shouldve
its an emergency dutton
we got tagged period
until i saw those photos
from van den berg i
they brought it on themselves
who the people in piedmont
what you said before
you dont believe the
infection in that capsule
was brought back deliberately do you
skip it i hope
im talking through my hat
put your hands on
that glass palms down
its a finger and palm
print analyzer it
reads a composite of 10000
dermatographic lines
howd you know that
oh dutton i have a
long criminal record
then youre in trouble
this machine has a long memory
it gives you final clearance
to enter wildfire
isothermal
reading for mc levels 4 and 5
is zb and ra over 29
hows piedmont
i had to order up a 712
how are you ruth
no other way to halt
the infection spread
oh
oh you two know
each other dont you
by reputation only
ah yes up to now weve
had to worship from a far
be good ruth
any messages for me
from the white house
not a thing dr stone or youd have it
no personal messages
no maam
nothing from dr robertson
are you sure sergeant
dr stone sir i have
one thing to do just one
everything else is fully automatic
computerized and selfregulating
i i listen for a
little bell in here
dingaling that
means a message
coming in is for the wildfire team
precisely an mcn communication
im expecting one
yes sir top priority
dingaling i push a button
and all five level control
centers are notified
the same time you are
the bell hasnt rung sir
thanks for the tour sergeant
dr dutton thank you
will you follow me dr leavitt
and may i have your glasses please
what for
theyll be treated and
returned to you doctor
they better be
or ill need a white cane
who picked leavitt
talk about the odd man hypothesis
which we havent yet
shes really an oddball
were lucky to have her
shes the best equipped of us
to double up for kirke in microbiology
when dressed
the team will proceed
directly to conference room 7
keep this with you at all times
whats it for
youre the odd man
the key man quite literally
this other key
and wildfire itself
depend on your key
wildfires equipped
with a nuclear device
for selfdestruct
in an emergency
its activated automatically
ive just inserted the
key in the main station
that arms the mechanism
the device is ready for detonation
when
never we hope
it only goes off if theres danger
of infection breaking out from here
that silver key cant be removed
youre the only one
who can disarm the mechanism
by inserting your red key
in one of the substations
located throughout the facility
theres a fiveminute delay
between the time detonation locks in
and the bomb explodes
that gives
you a chance to think
and please god call it off
look im the new boy here why me
because youre single
you should have done
your homework sport
page 255 robbies odd man hypothesis
results of testing confirm
the robertson odd man hypothesis
that an unmarried male should
carry out command decisions
involving thermonuclear
destruct contexts
let me take a look at that
its of vital importance
that you always know where you are
in relation to the nearest substation
to do that you have to be familiar
with the entire facility
it can be studied on
this electronic diagram
which rotates to afford an overall view
or can be stopped at any section
detailed plans of the
various levels and labs
are also stored in the system
were on level 1 of a fivestory
cylindrical underground structure
surrounded by solid rock
each level has three substations
indicated by the yellow lights
in the event the nuclear
device is triggered
you can still cancel selfdestruct
by inserting your red
key in a substation
after our last simulation run
we decided to add two
more substations per level
but theyre not finished
so dont confuse them
with functioning ones
at the bottom of the central core
is the apparatus for selfdestruct
each level is a different color
based on a navy study
of the psychological effects
of color in environments
also each level is biomedically cleaner
than the one above it
we dont want anything
to contaminate a possible organism
that would make it twice as hard
to isolate and characterize
itll take us 16 hours to descend
through the programmed
decontamination procedures
on the first four levels to level 5
where the main labs are
where exactly are we now
theres one way you can
always locate yourself
or any of us instantly
simply by calling up projections
from the electronic diagram
on any video monitor
anywhere in wildfire
views such as this
this shows were in
conference room 7 level 1
each of us is indicated by our initial
our movements are continuously monitored
on the electronic diagram
where are the patients
wheres the capsule
the patients are the yellow xs
the red circle is the capsule
on level 5 the patients
and capsule will be isolated
in biologically secure setups
are you sure the old man
and the baby are still alive
what are their chances hall
uncertain
im hoping the intravenous dextrose
and saline will hold them
until we get to them
we start decontamination and
immunization procedures now
you really expect me to fire the thing
im afraid you dont understand
all you can do is stop it
in a biological emergency
the bomb is activated automatically
itll then go off within five minutes
unless you get to a substation
and lock in your key
oh
delta five to all levels
we are checking out rayban
emergency communications
this is a test
proceed to infrared radiation
decontamination room 1d
also it could be an organism
from another planet
released deliberately
to wipe us out really charles
just the opposite
to make friendly contact
a kind of messenger to show us
life exists elsewhere in the universe
it could be benign in
its own environment
pretty farfetched
we cant ignore any possibility
you are about to
undergo longwave radiation
a buzzer will sound
close your eyes and stand still
or blindness may result
we face quite a problem
how to disinfect the human body
one of the dirtiest things
in the known universe
that is without killing the
human being at the same time
it gets tougher as we go
hard on the taxpayers
the way we burn up uniforms
theyre paper
id swear it was cloth
new process
wheres the next substation hall
left of elevator on level 2
right across the corridor
from body analysis
our next port of call
not for my alabaster body
i mean it stone
you can take your body
analyzer and you can
sit down please
please look at the screen
in front of you
please place your body so
that all points are obliterated
that is fine we may proceed
state your name for the records
surname first
mark hall
hall mark
thank you for your cooperation
yes dear
please answer the
following questions yes or no
have you any allergies
yes to ragweed pollen
okay ill repeat for
your memory cells
please repeat your response
for our memory cells
ragweed pollen
this ends the formal questioning
please undress
this is a scan for fungal lesions
dr stone this is level 2 control
the answer is affirmative
major manchek contacted the white house
at 1123 this morning
contact on
all leads is r for ready
do not be nervous
im not nervous
physical parameters
are being measured
theres no need to be nervous dr leavitt
please raise your left arm
please sit up facing the scan screen
and watch carefully
you have received pneumatic injections
of booster immunizations
you may get dressed thank you
this recording is now ended
that body analyzer
i want to be there when
the ama gets wind of it
so far its only been used by nasa
to diagnose astronauts in space
you doctors better start
making house calls again
this is a xenon lamp apparatus
to insure complete effectiveness
spread your feet apart
to protect scalp and facial hair
place the metal helmet
securely on the head
make sure the helmet is firmly seated
and the visor lowered
then raise your arms and wait
you may now remove helmet
you will notice a fine
white ash on your body
this is the outer epithelial
layers of your skin
that have been burned away
please replace the helmet in compartment
and proceed through shower in next room
then you may dress
and descend to level 4
were required to rest
for six hours on level 4
after exposure to the xenon lamp
so go to your rooms and sleep
at the end of the corridor
is the cafeteria
well meet there at 0400 hours
tomorrow

they refuse to believe
life exists in meteorites
i showed them at the astrophysics
conference what i just showed you
but no even with a microscope
they are blind
what do i have to do
hit them over the head
im glad youre amused gentlemen
but it might just turn out to be true
during this symposium
well discuss the possibility
that intelligent life
on a distant planet
may be no larger than a flea
perhaps no larger
than a bacterium
time to wake up sir
time to wake up sir
hello
time to wake up sir
who are you
time to wake up sir
do you wish something sir
your name
will that be all sir
for the moment
this is the answering
service supervisor
we wish you would adopt
a more serious attitude dr hall
sorry her voice is quite luscious
the voice belongs to miss gladys stevens
who is 63 years old
she lives in omaha and makes her living
taping messages for
voicereminder systems
much obliged
lets not get sidetracked
on rudolph karp
and his meteorite theories
his technique was worthless
i still think we should contact him
fair enough where is he
behind the iron curtain
he couldnt get a research grant here
hp nutrient now
available in the cafeteria
for staff members
from sectors 1 through 6
hemlock
all for you hippocrates
not your own venom
tastes like orange juice
nutrient 425
developed for the astronauts
eight ounces satisfy all daily
nutritional requirements
except coffee
and lipid soluble vitamins
for that we have these
help yourself
so whats the point
of the cafeteria
wildfire isnt always on crash status
maybe theres some sugar
nope
nothing that might provide
a bacterial growth medium
precisely no sugar in the gut
id like a cigarette right now
its after meals you miss them
you should have no trouble on level 5
you wont even get
this close to a meal
well be entirely on
highprotein nutrients
i planned our work in three stages
one detection
first step is to confirm
that an organism is present
two characterization
how is it structured
how does it work
three control
how to contain and exterminate
jeremy on this matter of extermination
we should go slowly
without ever realizing it
we might destroy a highly
intelligent form of life
why dont we get going
ive got two patients down there
the team has two subjects
theyre not guinea pigs stone
you may now
proceed to level 5 gentlemen
stop by your rooms and insert these
before taking the elevator
i have risked drowning
in that foul bath
i have been parboiled
irradiated and xenon flashed
and now you suggest i
i have to
we havent done anything
about the gl tract yet
on level 5 we must be
as nearly germ free as possible
anyone care to join me for a smoke

you are red kappa phoenix status
off the main
corridor on the outer rim
are the living quarters
conference room
cafeteria biosafety maintenance etc
inside are the labs
where is the library
no need for books
everythings in the computer
notice the capsule has
already been delivered
by the sterile conveyor system
to the main control lab here
your patients are here
in the hot room of miscellaneous
we cant have any
direct contact with them
poor souls
dr dutton
and dr hall are wanted
in main control immediately
hey
if the patients are sealed off
how do i get to them
ever used a glove box
no
wildfires gone a step further
whole rooms that operate
like glove boxes
youll be working in one shortly
we have a magnetic k indices
give us a code 3 when you get it
i wanted you here
while we find out
if theres anything still
biologically active in the capsule
suggestions
use a buffalo
audio
detectors e
through g correction
negative n scan
negative n scope in l y1
affirmative n indicator in mp4
i will repeat
negative n scan

whatever killed them at piedmont
is still there and
still as potent as ever
if potents the word
lets try a rhesus
yeah well want
a postmortem on it anyway
housekeeping to level 5
clean sweep schedule b now in effect
germfree animal technicians
please consult schedule
so okay
isolate and identify
right you and ill scan
the capsule ruth
charlie you work on these in autopsy
open the sl ruth
adjust s y system
for aseptricity as follows
points 2a at 5
points 9 through 12 at plus 1
plus 3 plus 6 at minus
run an initial vector study charlie
find out how the disease
enters the body
charlie
yes
yes the vector study first
then autopsy incredible
dutton be careful
let our distinguished surgeon
handle the knife
fine but not for a while
first im a pediatrician
and a geriatrist
take it easy
charlie will have a technician
whats been done for them
just plasma for the old man
dextrose for the baby
your therapy
no medcoms
do i call you miss medcom
if you like dr hall
my names karen anson
good i couldnt cope with two machines
how does this work
youre lucky
medcoms got one of the best minds here
its a medical data analyzer
that can diagnose as well as prescribe
its hooked up to the
main computer on level 1
every console and
instrument in wildfire
is plugged into the main computer
on a timesharing basis
all our key lab studies
are done on automated machines
i prefer the personal touch
its hard to come
by in those suits
have you worked in them
not for real
but ive been drilling for three months
thank god for an expert
this sort of things new to me
its new to all of us
until now wildfires been like a game
weve even had simulation
biowar games here
with live subjects volunteers
i mean im scared
i never believed
this could really happen
well it has happened
ill need some lab tests
use this to check off
what you want
just touch the pen to the screen
you draw the bloods
ill do the physicals
use the bar
the tunnel seals off
automatically behind you
the only way you might possibly
break your suit is with a scalpel
and a surgeon isnt likely to do that
biosafety to sl
an animal in airlock 095
reconfirm red rdp
status before transfer
second scan completed
score nothing to nothing
go to 100 power
no ruth
use only one microscanner
you being paid by the hour
we could cover the capsule
in one half the time
theres less chance of missing something
when we both concentrate on one screen
lets go directly to the inside
we can assume they put
the scoop on the thing
to scoop something into it
they sure got what
they were looking for
were not here to make accusations
we have a job to do
purely as scientists
maybe not so pure
continue the scan ruth on the outside
no dont do that
well use the hands
nothing can happen sir
im faster than the hands
i want you out of the hot room
bz doris to iz alice
sdt energy output
is 18 to 30 joules
with rate two to three milliradians
and we still need those blankets
no sweat sir
those cages are airtight
i wish you would sweat
a little more toby
sweat is a safeguard against some
kinds of bacteria and carelessness
use the hands
wow
transmitted by air as we thought
now weve got to determine its size
could be a gas or some kind of a virus
well use a hundred
angstrom filter to begin
about the size of a small virus
all systems go sir
whatever it is
its larger than a virus
well try a one micron filter
hang in there baby
he must be pretty big
im gonna get me a fly swatter
do that
here goes with two microns
uhhuh
nasty
at least well be able
to get a good look at it
dutton to stone
weve just found out its size
about two microns in diameter
big enough to be a complete cell
interesting
theres a good chance its alive
airborne transmission
yes what have you found
so far nothing
our nobel laureate here
wont scan on the inside
because he says
all right ruth
thanks charlie keep at it
its pointless to go on scanning outside
if its two microns in diameter
it wouldve showed up at 440
true but we didnt know
that before did we
well start with five power on the inside
stick to established procedure
establishment gonna
fall down and go boom
switch to manual ruth
the interiors too irregular
to probe on automatic
more light huh
heres his blood value now
half normal severely anemic
wake up sir
can you hear me
whats your name
jackson
what
jackson
stay awake mr jackson
stay awake
tongue blade
sixtyeight degrees on 1407
sixtyone on 1203
loss rate is minus 0012
please copy and confirm
all receiving locks
you can tell youre a bachelor
what was that
i didnt say anything
were doing an isotope scan
how the bugs get into the body
thought you should watch it
i assume it was inhaled
not likely its absorbed
through the skin
thats what well find out now
the mechanism of death
well look at a
replay of that at speed 6
that tells us
what we want to know hall
the organism is inhaled
the clotting begins in the lungs
and spreads outward
i didnt think it possible
i didnt think the total volume
of blood could solidify that fast
i hoped maybe one crucial clot
might form in the brain
which was what made them go insane
and then the rest of the
blood clot more slowly
wed have a chance to cure that
cure what
we dont know what it is
stone and leavitt havent been
able to isolate the hellish thing
of course they will in time
of course
hold it
at the edge of that
shadow i think
me too
its an indentation
yes about the
size of a pencil point
go to 40
go to 60
jeremy do you think maybe
maybe its
just a grain of sand
go to 80
what about the bits of green
paint for gods sake
pistachio ice cream
theres no basis to
assume its anything yet
youre too good a scientist not to
be thinking the same thing i am
if this is
really something new
some brandnew form of life
the best hope of cracking it
is to be grindingly thorough
with the help of computer number one
okay now lets get on with it
hold it
more pistachio
i count four patches
keep going
ill computerize the coordinates
lets take a look
at the rock at 100
i doubt thats what
knocked the capsule off trajectory
unless the rock was going
at tremendous speed
or unless its terribly heavy
for petes sake ruth
it cant be that heavy
hall and i could lift the capsule
however its possible the
rock is different in space
out there it might do anything
maybe it has elastic properties
we dont even know yet
lets have a look
at the green patches
they mustve come off the rock
if it is rock
you know something
they do look like spatters of paint
lets go back to the rock
and see it at 440
if thats a meteor
its a damn peculiar one
this left border over here
its smooth almost like
an artificial surface
painted maybe
luminous paint
if i keep watching it
i might think so
wet paint sign and all
jeremy
what
nothing
you okay
its just my eyes are tired
weve been at it five hours straight
well take a caffeine
break in a minute
first id like to see one of the
separate patches of green at 1000
did you see that
i saw it
you didnt change the lighting
i didnt touch it
looks alive
yes
its bigger than two microns
which means the infection is spread
by a mere fraction of the green
im bringing down cameras
lets have the other microscanner
stone to level control
i need a mict
roger will send
jump it up to 1500
microscan doesnt go any higher
we can get 1500 light
magnification in microchemistry
ill send the rock through
attention
clt s on levels 4 and 5
main computer shows capacity
versus access time
at ten to the twelfth bits
for any change in memory configuration
clt s must check their unicorn op
beautiful sir
im the mict
youre real sharp on the hands
thanks nice to know one
hasnt lost ones touch
the next step is to find out
what makes it grow
well need samples from the scoop
to send through maxcult
for culture and isolation
roger sir in work
good god
its growing
not so good
naturally he has acidosis
his blood ph was nine points off normal
but why stupid machine
what makes his blood too acid
ask the patient
biosafety to sl sectors 3 and 6
give us a code 3 when you get it
mr jackson
now dont be scared
im a doctor
bull
where am i
a special laboratory in nevada
we brought you here from piedmont
youre sick
its this damn stomach of mine
bleeding
hell yes bleeding
bleeding in your stomach
you have an ulcer
damn tooting two years
but you must have pain
what do you do for it
aspirin
and squeeze
squeeze whats that
aint gonna tell you
so youre a sterno drinker huh
works good
give him squeeze
whats the babys name mr jackson
you the nurse
uhhuh
shoot
cant see your legs
do you know the babys name
give us a butt first
smoking isnt allowed here
then go fish
yeah
when youre finished
well transfuse jackson
and start ice water lavage
he has a twoyear history
of bleeding ulcers
you seem delighted
it may be the reason he survived
if only our young gourmet
werent so normal
well lets hope
nothing changes that
we might have to
before this is over
they shouldve dropped the bomb
they shouldve dropped it
two days ago general
this phantom crashed a good 60 miles
beyond the cordoned area
men on the ground cant
cordon off airspace sir
i just dont understand
why the wildfire team
hasnt beefed about
the delay in 712
its been almost 24 hours
and not a word from them
i dont think piedmont had anything
to do with this crash manchek
it was a fluke
that plane was only over the wf area
for two minutes at 23000 feet
its a routine training
mission accident i bet you
pilot error
lets go
check with wildfire
message center delta five
make sure everything there is nominal
send me word on scrambler
at big head crash base
okay
checklim program completed
all circuit banks nominal
same thing on the mcn console captain
just a minute dr robertson
youre saying stones
90 million facility
which you recommended
was knocked out
by a sliver of paper
you tell that to the taxpayers
these were highlytrained
electronics men senator
looking for an electronic fault
the trouble was purely mechanical
of the simplest kind
but for them it was like trying to see
an elephant through a microscope
the sliver had peeled from the roll
and wedged between the bell and striker
preventing the bell from ringing
im convinced were
being held incommunicado
very flattering
we dont know much more
than when we got here
we know about scoop now
its possible what scoop
found was no accident
i suspect they were looking for
the ultimate biological weapon
sounds like youre getting
a little paranoid in this fun house
what does stone think
about the ultimate weapon i mean
weve isolated the organism
its in microchemistry
well show you
watchdog
to electrical support
all right lieutenant
albuquerque
center this is air force 561
go ahead 561
my air hose is coming apart
like its dissolving
everything made of rubber
is coming apart
i feel funny
its a fluke a vibration effect maybe
lets get up there
has wildfire been informed
you mean the germ people
it went out to them on
the scrambler an hour ago
this they cant ignore
i b control
to cafeteria level 3
number 4 charlie hatch
shows condition blue
alter responsivity characteristics
until you get condition green
ready
nothing so unusual
about our rock after all
hydrogen carbon oxygen
sulfur silicon et cetera
except the black rock
isnt rock at all
its some kind of material
similar to plastic
how about that
the green is even simpler
hydrogen carbon
nitrogen and oxygen
the four basic elements
of life on earth nothing else
thats a relief
id have been happier
if itd turned out not to be alive
green stuff
you really had us going for a while
a a analysis results
are ready dr dutton
somethings wrong
its not registering
yes it is sir
its just registering
doublezero doublezero
well switch to computerized analysis
no amino acids
no proteins no
enzymes no nucleic acid
impossible no organism
can maintain life without them
you mean no earth organism
it must have evolved in
a totally different way
you got it
it doesnt come from here
without chemical reactions
there cant be life
yet it grows reproduces
wait
the infection at piedmont
has been stopped by the bomb
were secure at wildfire
we have everything we need
to achieve a breakthrough
all we have to do is attack this
problem like any other in science
you could spend years
working on a thing like that
without solving its structure
but when you do therell be
some red faces around
it could change everything
great
ruth since kirke isnt here
you take over the growth
program in microbiology
were halfway home if we find out
what will keep that from growing
charlie you work with
me on the em hall
all right
let me get back to my patients
im sure they were
protected by the same thing
some simple mechanism
i just dont recognize yet
theres got to be something
that the old man and
baby have in common
oh hall
five minutes
you told me before
yes we wouldnt want you to get
too far from the substation now
men keep a
sharp eye open for pieces of rubber
ill repeat that for you
keep a sharp eye open
for pieces of rubber
major
major manchek
take a look at that sir
we just found this general
its a human bone
arm i think
it looks picked clean
almost like it was polished
thats right
well i dont get it
there is no actual rubber
on the phantom f4 general
its all a synthetic plastic
compound called polycron
it has some of the characteristics
of human skin
what the hell is that
whats left of his oxygen mask
its made of polycron
id say it was done
by a chemical reaction
of some sort
or maybe a microorganism
meaning
meaning there was something
in that plane that consumes plastic
hows maxcult coming ruth
will you be finished by
the midnight conference
easy
good you can give us
the results then
feeling better arent you mr jackson
yep
do you always have
to wear that iron suit
yep
maybe youll tell us
the babys name now
mr jackson
manuel rios mex
real little heller
squalls morning noon and night
neighbors wouldnt let them
keep their windows open
do you sleep with your window closed
no sirree bob
fresh air fiend
tell us what happened mr jackson
i dont want to think about it
you know what people will say
piedmont was bad
thats why it was punished
first the town went crazy
and then was destroyed
youre crazy
folks at piedmont was good
decent normal folks
the man we found dressed up
in his doughboys uniform
call that normal
pete arnold who worked at the store
it was the disease
how do you know
cause the only thing wrong with him
before that night was sugar
diabetes did he take insulin
a couple of times a day
hated the needle
i tried to talk him
into using squeeze
insulin if he missed his
treatment hed go
thanks mr jackson
oh my god
central cc
to big pc control all levels
testing laser system
please maintain random fringe drift
within ten percent of initial value
dr leavitt you have
a midnight conference
the signal has struck twice
i heard
i heard ive been busy
the important thing is
something can slow it down
i think its some kind
of blood disorder
if the old soldier missed
his insulin treatment
hed go into acidosis
the same as jackson on sterno
ill bet leavitt finds the
organism shows no growth
on some of the blood cultures
whats wrong
with the babys blood
nothing so far
then youre back where you started
no somehow theyre all interrelated
ill have the answer when i know
why a 69yearold sterno drinker
with an ulcer is like a normal
sixmonthold baby
did you get any nogrowth readouts
no but im not finished yet
you told me youd be finished
i decided to play part of it back
what for the first
time around should be
knock it off hall
wait wait
were all tired
tired people make mistakes
they draw wrong conclusions
they drop things
that mustnt happen
starting now i want the team to get
six hours sleep out of every 24
suits me
before turning in
shouldnt we file for a code name
yeah good idea
nine over 4 over 8
under 16729
auto check in grade
why andromeda
andromedas our
stone
directive 712 has not been acted upon
alternative directive 711 now in effect
they didnt drop the bomb
its an mcn transmission sent yesterday
idiots
put me through to dr robertson
in work sir
burke you didnt special alert
an mcn message to us
there havent been any sir
the bell didnt ring
dont argue damn it
ive got one in my hand
well well about time
we heard from you
there has been a communications foulup
never mind that now
why hasnt that bomb
been dropped on piedmont
the decision on 712 isnt final
it was just postponed 48 hours
by then the disease could spread
into a worldwide epidemic
its because of rash
statements like that
the president doesnt trust scientists
warn the president
it may already be too late
stay on his back robbie
youve got to make him call a 712
can you get me another
appointment tonight grimes
now lets all just keep
our heads screwed on
any thoughts about
the phantom crash
we sent you a couple messages on it
a phantom jet strayed over the
cordoned area around piedmont
any other information
well the pilot said
that all the rubber on
the plane was dissolving
his last communication was pretty weird
like he was crazy
he was mighty confused thats for sure
robbie its your job
to get the president
to activate a 712 immediately
if he doesnt theres no guarantee
anyone west of piedmont
will be alive in the morning
simmer down professor
ill wake the boss
but general sparks says
the crash was just a fluke
forget the crash robbie
stay on that 712 and get back to me
well be working around the clock
thats a good slice
its too thick
im setting it at 800 angstroms
and im going to a higher magnification
now were getting somewhere
yeah
but these cant be more
than a few molecules in depth
thats the one that silver one
this is a villabach alert
all levels
this is a villabach alert
electromagnetic waves are not
registering on the dlr
sample in the button
and sealed charlie
start the vacuum pump
stone can i see you
i have the results
of the growth cultures
no we cant leave now
we have an andromeda cell in the em
okay charlie lets
put it on the screen
lets run it through the computer
for contrast expansion
stone
what do you think
it looks like a crystal
well gentlemen theres our answer
to what
how andromeda functions
without amino acids
crystalline structure
yes
ive often thought
that living matter
might be based on
crystals of some kind
all these wedgeshaped compartments
theyd serve to separate
biochemical functions very well
its dividing
in a vacuum bombarded by electrons
it shouldnt even be alive
thats what i wanted to tell you
the growth program shows
andromeda can live on anything
only gas and light affect it
you didnt get any nogrowth
results on the cultures
none look
the poorest growth
occurs in pure oxygen
incubated under infrared light
andromeda grows best in
carbon dioxide and hydrogen
incubated under x rays
no excretions
no waste of any kind
youd expect that
andromedas perfect
for existence in outer space
consumes everything wastes nothing
good lord stone to delta five
put me through to robertson immediately
what
god i hope were not too late
tell me
it functions like an atomic reactor
an atomic blast could provide it
with enough energy to grow
into a gigantic supercolony
in one day
you can relax now
weve just left the president
he agreed to drop the bomb
no youve got to stop 712
from being carried out
now wait a minute
were not playing pingpong
we just got through
telling the president
for gods sake go back
it grows when exposed to x rays
or any source of energy
tell him no nuclear device
must be detonated anywhere near it
we just found out andromeda works
like a little reactor
converts matter to energy
energy to matter directly
then the bomb would only provide
a fantastically rich growth medium
understand
no but ill pass along
the recommendation
the boss will be pleased to know
that he made the right decision
on 712 in the first place
congratulate him
on his scientific insight
and robbie
youd better get the
atomic selfdestruct in here
disarmed as soon as possible
right ill start on the clearances now
itll be done by morning
no no no
that wont work until
the damn things going
all the molecules
appear to be the same
yes
andromeda isnt composed
of different substances
like a normal cell
all the subunits are the same
damndest thing ive ever s
boy a single substance
then how the
hell does it operate
how does anything so simple
utilize energy for growth
no way of telling
from that structure
yes there is
with this new data
we can get a computerized version
of how andromeda functions
theyre not uniform
could be mutations
what the devil
the computers overloaded
too much data coming in too fast
dividing and mutating
at the same time
and nothing to stop it
normal earth checks and
balances dont exist for it
wed better get a biomath mapping
of its new growth potential and spread
according to this
therell be a supercolony
of andromeda over the
entire southwest
jeremy these are
biological warfare maps
why yes so they are
oh but simulations charlie
defensive its just a scenario
thats not the point
for gods sake
wildfire was built
for germ warfare
wildfire and scoop
and you knew stone
you knew it
thats not true ruth
i learned about scoop
the same time you did
they already have
andromeda programmed
the purpose of scoop was to find
new biological weapons in outer space
and then use wildfire to develop them
it stinks
youre blowing your tops
we have no proof
the map
dont be an ass
that map only shows what andromeda
could do in the hands of an enemy
enemy we did it to ourselves
perhaps but this is hardly the time
to organize a protest
another giant leap for mankind
i wish i could believe you
whether you do or not
the only important thing now
is to find the antidote
lets get on with it charlie
test the cultured organisms
for biologic potency
all right ill run them
against a rat in autopsy
i want to seal up the capsule
watch it
andromedas altered
its effect might be radically different
ill try to get us a photo
of the mutated form
photo lab to red map
the offbeat access reference
reads at 649f 1500
please copy
this may be the key
to beating andromeda
how by starving him to death
no but dont feed him until i tell you
contamination
a seal has broken in autopsy
emergency procedures are in effect
whats the matter
infection spread autopsy
is he alive
i shouldve been with him dr dutton
its no use its sealed off
dr hall
shes in trouble
ruth are you
shes got the germ
someone bring 100 milligrams
of phenobarb in a syringe fast
theres no danger
she isnt contagious
theres no danger
to l5
p i e and e t e
your second quarter rest
period has been canceled
time ra has been reassigned
according to crash program
come on
come on she cant hurt you
wasnt she with dr dutton
no its epilepsy
give her the injection
shell be all right
good girl thanks
im scared
oh lord im scared
youll be okay charlie
were pumping pure oxygen
through your lab now
we know andromeda
doesnt do well in oxygen
hes alive
where have you been
leavitt had a seizure
what
epilepsy the red light
flashing at 3 per second
brought on a fit
why in the hell didnt
she tell us about it
no top lab would have her if they knew
insurance prejudice all that crap
from the middle ages
amazing hes still alive
well its been three minutes
hes on pure oxygen
i dont know how long that can hold him
were working on some ideas charlie
ask your germ warfare friends
they have lots
try to stay calm
what happened
seal mustve broken in there
they had the same thing at the lunar lab
thats why we use polycron gaskets here
at least the rest of wildfire is secure
poor devil
look at the way hes breathing
hes scared to death
that oxygen should relax him
slow down his breathing
no we want him to breathe fast
in piedmont jackson
was crocked on sterno
sterno acidosis
acidosis rapid breathing
what the hell you doing
turn off the oxygen
put him on room air
the baby hes normal
cries all the time
cant catch his breath
rapid breathing
it just cant be that simple
it isnt
dutton i think rapid breathing helps
dont let the bug in
your lungs long enough
to penetrate blood vessels
i want to turn off the pure oxygen
then you start breathing
room air as fast as you can
no no
i was running a test in here
the air is thick with andromeda
experiment with your own life damn it
we wont do it charlie
take it easy
i know im close
im sure it has something to do
with blood chemistry and breathing
dr hall may i please
feed the baby now
hes been crying steadily
thats what i want keep him crying
run another blood value on him
get his ph measurements
yes doctor
with all the yelling
blowing off carbon dioxide
the kid should have too little acid
alkaline a blood condition just
the opposite from the old man
too much alkali
well what good does that do dutton
karen wheres the blood test
its coming through now on your console
hell of a way to run a hospital
just what you expected
opposite blood chemistries
the baby and the old man
one of them should
be a dead opposite
but hes not
there must be a connection
they both stayed alive at piedmont
breathing the same air
ones blood too alkaline
the other too acid
yes yes
dutton im turning off the oxygen
breathe fast and hard
no jeremy
dont let him cut off my oxygen
no the air in that room is loaded
air doesnt matter
blood does thats the answer
i need 30 seconds
to run a growth program
he could die in 30 seconds
besides leavitt checked
all the growth programs
she might have missed something
epileptics blank out
i want to see how the
growth of andromeda
is affected by blood
chemistry the ph
oh damn
you do it
excellent
the graphs practically
straight up and down
that means andromeda can only exist
within a narrow range of ph
a very narrow range
on either side of the
tolerance range no growth
nothing right
its exterminated
dutton our troubles are over
look at your console
it grows within
a narrow range of ph
a very narrow range
if your bloods abnormal
if its too acid or alkaline
andromeda cant survive
in the body
so breathe as fast as you can
go into respiratory alkalosis
yes fine
thatll shoot your
blood chemistry to hell
its what happens to the baby
when he cries too much
or the old man on sterno
how do you feel
okay
a little dizzy but okay
he cant keep breathing
like that forever
hell hyperventilate pass out
weve got to get him something
to alkalize his blood
we cant in there
charlie
that cage in the hot room
right in front of you
its alive
the rats been exposed as long as i have
longer i exposed it to the cultures
before the seal broke
precisely
andromedas mutated
to a noninfectious form
holy
where does that gasket lead
central core
it connects all the labs
the gaskets are decomposing
its andromeda
next sector
theres no substation in this sector
level 5 is sealed
emergency procedures are in effect
when the bomb goes off
therell be a thousand mutations
andromeda will spread everywhere
theyll never be rid of it
there are now five
minutes to selfdestruct
what about the other levels
cant tell each sector seals off
when its contaminated
even the elevator
the defense system is perfect
itll even bury our mistakes
what about the central core
the cores equipped with safeguards
like what
gas lasers
to prevent escape of lab animals
what would my chances be
they dont exist for anyone
anywhere if you stay here
how do i get into the core
through that service port
go ahead
ill ride shotgun for
you in main control
i cant monitor the lasers here
karen get me a scalpel
there are now four minutes
and 30 seconds to selfdestruct
cut it off
cut the panel off
karen cut it
come on hurry up
hey doc you aint leaving
us here are you
the lasers are tuned low
for small animals mark
you can make it if youre not
hit along the spinal cord
there are now
four minutes to selfdestruct
thats the
ladder across from you
go before the gas starts
there are now three minutes
and 30 seconds to selfdestruct
thats the gas keep going
the sensors have picked you up
get moving
duck
keep going
duck
keep going
duck
there are now
three minutes to selfdestruct
no its no good
the levels contaminated
youll have to go to 3
go to 3
there are now two minutes
and 45 seconds to selfdestruct
sway weave
youre zeroed in duck
there are now two minutes
and 30 seconds to selfdestruct
keep going youll make it
there are now two minutes
and 15 seconds to selfdestruct
fight the effect its mostly shock
youve lost some time
but you can still do it
see the door
there are now two
minutes to selfdestruct
there is now one minute and
45 seconds to selfdestruct
there is now one minute and
30 seconds to selfdestruct
there is now
youre in an airlock
turn the wheel
one minute and 15
seconds to selfdestruct
no not that one
the one near the door
there are now
60 seconds to selfdestruct
there are now 55 seconds to selfdestruct
there are now 50 seconds to selfdestruct
where is it
there are now 45 seconds to selfdestruct
come on where is it
help me
there are now 40 seconds to selfdestruct
there are now 35 seconds to selfdestruct
there are now 30 seconds to selfdestruct
there are now 25 seconds to selfdestruct
twenty seconds
19 18 17
1110 9
selfdestruct has been canceled
congratulations
i take it the bomb didnt
no it didnt
eight seconds to spare
hardly even exciting
whats happening
the super colonys now off the coast
and moving southwest across the pacific
apparently andromeda
hasnt turned lethal again
at least there havent been
any reports of bizarre deaths
were applying an adaptation
of your antidote to it
cloud seeding
were seeding the clouds above andromeda
with silver iodide
the raindrops will carry the
organism into the ocean
and the alkaline reaction
from seawater should kill it
just as acids or alkali
in the blood stopped it
this cloud seeding business
you absolutely sure it worked
you better be
all reports indicate
the experiment was successful
then we can feel confident
your socalled
biological crisis is over
as far as andromedas concerned yes
we have the organism at wildfire
and we continue to study it
we now know beyond a doubt
that other forms of life
exist in the universe
thanks to scoop
yes
however with this new knowledge
theres no guarantee
that another socalled biological crisis
