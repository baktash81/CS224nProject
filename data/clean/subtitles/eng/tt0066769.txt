i didn t notice them before 
that s crazy  i didn t know
buzzards fly at night 
that s what they look like 
here 
boy  that s some dead burg 
buzzards only come
when something s dead 
well  i guess we better
go in and have a look 
this is caper one to vandal deca 
caper one to vandal deca 
are you reading  over 
yes  i m reading  over 
we re about to enter
the town of piedmont
and recover the satellite 
very good  caper one 
leave your radio open 
roger  
we re now inside the town 
it s kind of spooky 
i see a church steeple
ahead on the left 
it s quiet here 
it s the damndest thing 
there s no sign of life 
the signals from the satellite
are getting very strong 
sir  you see that  lieutenant 
see what  crane 
over by the fence 
it looks like a body 
easy  crane 
you re imagining things 
holy 
sir  it s another one 
you re right  it looks dead 
yes  sir  shall i   
no  stay in the van 
vandal deca to caper one 
what s happening 
we see bodies  lots of them 
are you certain  caper one 
damn it  com roe 
of course we re certain 
your orders are proceed
to satellite and retrieve 
roger  vandal deca 
stay at your stations 
hit that security button 
get me major manchek 
somehow they don t
hardly look dead  lieutenant 
they re all over the place 
must be dozens of them 
damn it  get this call through 
it s sort of like they just
dropped in their tracks  sir 
sir 
good chri    
do you see that thing in white 
yeah  it s coming toward us 
major  this may sound crazy 
but there s something strange
going on with caper one 
sir  i think we should get out of h   
hello  ops  this is major manchek 
scoop control a 12 
we need a flyby over
piedmont  new mexico 
infrared  a f l l r scan  all sectors 
film to come direct to scoop 
assign gunner wilson 
if he s not crocked someplace 
jeez 
i m declaring a state of emergency 
all personnel restricted to base 
everything seen and heard
in that room is top secret 
yes  sir 
this is a recording 
state your name and
your message and hang up 
major arthur manchek 
scoop mission control a 12 
i recommend calling a wildfire alert 
we have evidence here on film
of unnatural death caused by 
scoop 7 returning to earth 
time check 0 1 4 7 inclusive 
we d like to see dr  jeremy stone  please 
well  i m mrs  stone 
we are having a party  may i   
does that man have a gun 
ma am  we must see dr  stone 
what is this 
please call dr  stone to the door 
otherwise we ll go get him 
just a minute 
i ll just wait here  ma am 
i ll come to berkeley anytime  stone 
that  4 million must be
your largest federal grant 
may i see you  jeremy 
the s d s  has arrived  no doubt 
jeremy  there are some
army types in the hall
and two more outside with guns 
they want to see you 
i ll take care of it 
jeremy  if you knew about this 
you might ve told   
i didn t  i ll explain later 
i m dr  stone 
yes  i m captain morton 
there s a fire  sir 
i ve got to leave 
for god s sakes  jeremy 
when will you be back 
i m not sure 
the guns  is it   
mrs  stone  it s our job
to protect your husband 
from now on  nothing must
be allowed to happen to him 
i ll be safe as in your arms 
jeremy  jeremy 
you tell the senator it s his daughter 
allison 
dad  something very
peculiar has just happened 
even for jeremy 
a few minutes ago   
dad  are you there 
what s going on 
this communication
is being monitored  the connection
has been broken for reasons
of national security 
you will be briefed
at the appropriate time 
thank you for your cooperation  mrs  stone 
i feel like onassis 
it was the fastest thing
we could arrange  sir 
thanks 
yes 
general sparks here 
i just wanted to inform you
that all members of your
team have been cleared
and are now being called in 
except for professor kirke 
he s in the hospital  appendectomy 
you ll get complete
details on everything
when your team is assembled 
you don t make sense 
you talk like you ve been brainwashed 
you don t understand 
germ warfare people  dad 
a lab accident 
thank you 
it s different this time 
don t pack  claire 
i won t need anything 
a hippie  he s going to a love in 
i give up 
one minute you re fed up 
you talk about retiring to alaska yet 
now you ve turned into
a cloak and dagger man 
my glasses 
here they are  dad 
can t you at least tell me who phoned
at this ungodly hour 
grandpa  there s a car 
and they got guns 
do they now 
well  that s serious 
i ll watch out 
honey  you ve been dreaming 
i wish i were 
no  uh uh 
get someone else 
dr  leavitt  i told you  there s a fire 
my experiment s at the critical stage 
i ve been working around the clock 
i can t just leave now 
i want that new plate read
as soon as it s developed 
yes  ma am 
my orders come from dr  robertson 
the president s science
advisor in washington 
there s a phone  pick it up 
call robbie 
tell him i burnt my draft card 
are you sick  ma am 
we have a physician on call 
all dr  leavitt needs is rest 
knock it off  bess 
if the physician certifies that
you are unable to continue   
no 
i m fine 
relax 
i m going with you 
skin knife 
hold it  mark 
sorry to disturb you 
there s just been a call
from a dr  robertson
at the white house 
your orders are to break scrub 
orders  i ve got a patient all ready 
kelly will take over for you 
it s all arranged 
you re expected in the
surgeon s room in 30 seconds 
are you sure the satellite
isn t radioactive 
no  manchek showed me
the telemetry reports 
presumably  it could be
some form of space germ 
presumably this stuff is nonporous 
why did you pick me 
you re an m d   a talented surgeon
who knows blood chemistries
and you re single   
the  odd man hypothesis  
what the hell is that 
didn t you read the wildfire material
i ve been sending you 
very little 
i never went in much
for science fiction 
nor do i 
it seems to me  general 
dr  stone put one over on you 
in fact  he made us all think
his wildfire lab could handle
contamination from outer space 
i disagree with the senator from vermont 
dr  stone  a nobel prize winner 
twice president of the
national academy of sciences 
is well known here in washington 
is the implication that dr  stone
deliberately misled us 
perhaps not deliberately  senator 
i m reasonably certain
that before the night
the wildfire team was mobilized 
dr  stone didn t know scoop existed 
i m astounded 
reasons of national security 
very smart 
we ve had experiences
with scientists before 
now  let s talk about
this famous letter 
dr  stone sent to the president
some two years ago 
from what you re saying 
it was just a shot in the dark 
perhaps that s a little unfair  senator 
dr  stone and i were
consultants with nasa
on the lunar receiving lab 
he wasn t completely satisfied 
he felt a more advanced
lab was required 
you mean more expensive  don t you 
i call that dr  stone s  90 million
mash note to uncle sam 
 in a true biological crisis
which our exploration of
space could bring about 
the present lunar receiving laboratory
might prove inadequate 
i therefore urge
the establishment of a facility
to deal specifically
with an extraterrestrial form of life 
the purpose of this facility
would be to limit the dissemination
of such an unknown organism
from outer space
and to provide laboratories
for its analysis 
i recommend that this facility be located
in an uninhabited region
of the united states 
that it utilize all known
isolation techniques 
and that it be equipped
with a nuclear device
for self destruction in the event
of an emergency 
yours very truly  jeremy stone  
don t encourage the president
to think scientists are wizards 
if things get out of control 
and they might 
even you can t work miracles 
i d expect to have
your help  charlie 
piedmont approaching  gentlemen 
go over and give us a look first  dempsey 
i was afraid of that 
the birds ll eat the infected flesh 
and then fly off and
spread the disease 
if it is a disease 
drop the gas canisters 
someone s supposed to be alive down there 
somebody did something 
that s for sure 
let s give it a double dose 
that gas will only kill the birds 
okay  dempsey  hover
over the main street
and drop the ladder 
do not attempt to land 
is that clear 
roger  clearer all the time 
when we climb down 
lift off to 1 000 feet
and hover at a safe distance 
and come back when we signal 
if anything happens to us 
you have your orders 
yes  sir  proceed directly
to wildfire and then   
if we re eliminated 
the aircraft and pilot
will have to be sterilized 
wait a minute 
that s not what they told me 
just incinerated 
coronary 
i doubt it 
hall 
take a look at this 
are you sure that isn t coronary 
no  coronary s painful 
they should grimace 
if it was fast  they wouldn t have time 
fast  these people were
cut down in mid stride 
up there  look 
an air force jet 
if we don t make it to wildfire 
he ll see the helicopter does   
or shoot it down 
well  for dempsey s sake 
we better not slip up 
 the day of judgment is at hand 
have mercy on my soul
and to hell with all
the others  amen  
senile 
this took time 
regardless of what made her do it 
it took time 
there s a chance someone s still alive 
i wouldn t believe you could
commit suicide that way 
most of them died instantly 
but a few had time
to go quietly nuts 
let s find the damn satellite 
this injury  there isn t any bleeding 
a cut like this    torn veins 
broken capillaries   
should bleed like hell 
yes  well  there s no blood
on any of them 
even where it s chewed  no bleeding 
hold it  hold it 
you d better back up 
we gotta go to the    left 
we re damn close  bear right 
i ll bet they took it to the doctor 
there it is 
the damn fool opened it 
yeah  every country doctor
should run his office
like the lunar lab 
the capsule first  hall 
we ve got about 40
minutes of oxygen left 
have a look at his buttocks 
that s not funny 
not meant to be 
normally blood in a dead person
goes to the lowest points 
there should be marks of lividity 
do you see purplish marks on his butt 
no 
careful you don t puncture your suit 
clotted blood 
powdered 
i ll be damned 
no wonder they didn t bleed 
it s clotted throughout
the entire system 
five quarts of blood
turned to powder 
in theory  i suppose 
a single organism could do it 
but  in fact  there isn t
an organism on earth   
you mean  there didn t used to be 
i don t   
we heard it all right 
go away  go back 
get back  get out
of here  go back 
get away 
this must be the mother 
he s scared  and hungry as hell 
can t be more than six months 
there s probably a
formula in the kitchen 
don t feed it 
he hasn t eaten in
at least 12 hours 
we don t do anything
until we get that kid
into a controlled situation 
maybe feeding is part
of the disease process 
maybe those who hadn t
eaten lasted longest 
whatever it is  with
our oxygen running out 
we can t take a chance 
wait a minute 
this is a major break   
a survivor 
too bad he can t tell
us what happened 
maybe he can    if he lives 
you 
you    you did it 
give me that knife 
you re not human 
everybody s dead 
what happened 
what is it 
what happened 
the town is finished 
contaminated beyond all   
careful  sir 
this is an open transmission 
i m aware of that  manchek 
order up a 7 12 
only the president   
precisely  get on it 
the town must be
neutralized immediately 
has the president made his decision
on directive 7 12 yet 
he doesn t jump into
things  dr  robertson 
first i ve got to put together
a briefing for him 
the president s main concern is
the international consequences 
what do you think  mr  secretary 
it s against the moscow treaty of 1963
to fire thermonuclear
weapons above ground 
the russians will have
to be privately informed
we re going to cauterize the area 
then they ll ask a flock of questions 
some we don t want answered 
that ll take hours 
god knows how far the infection
can spread in that time 
yes  chief 
yes  sir 
yes  mr  president 
the president s decided
to postpone directive 7 12
for 24 to 48 hours 
instead he ll call
out the national guard
to cordon off the area around piedmont 
that s your department  ed 
safe and sound 
it should ve been left up
to the scientists 
it s a colossal mistake 
tell the president i said so 
no  but   
i ll get you an appointment 
by whose decision  general 
was the site for wildfire chosen 
dr  stone s 
it seemed ideal because
of its remoteness 
there was no inhabited area
near wildfire for a
radius of 112 miles 
las vegas is to the north 
phoenix to the south 
los angeles west 
weren t you worried
the infection might spread to them 
yes  sir  i was 
but dr  stone and dr  robertson
assured the president 
wildfire was foolproof
because of its device
for atomic self destruct 
the military had to
take a backseat 
at least they could ve
sent a licensed driver
to meet me at that crummy airstrip 
they keep personnel to a minimum
for obvious reasons 
you re lost 
no one s been down
this goat path for years 
that s how it s supposed to look 
they spent  50 000 on it 
putting in the potholes 
getting rid of the tread marks 
those big tractors leave
a lasting impression 
a lot of heavy equipment
has passed this way 
where s our leader 
we ll catch up to him
and hall very soon now 
why d they pick hall 
he s no scientist 
who needs an overpriced m  d 
relax and enjoy your cigarette 
it s your last 
it starts here 
it s a great place to grow pot 
just a plain old crop of barley 
still  it is rather clever  i think 
something wrong 
i never liked red lights 
reminds me of my years in a bordello 
howdy 
howdy do dee 
you got the time 
my watch stopped at 11 46 
darn shame 
must be the heat 
it s no fake  believe me 
when i retire 
i d like an agricultural
station like this in alaska 
you  a sourdough 
hmph  the sourest  this way 
step in 
cute 
the whole thing 
what a world we re making 
i can see why the kids are dropping out 
we should ve 
it s an emergency  dutton 
we got tagged  period 
until i saw those photos
from van den berg  i   
they brought it on themselves 
who  the people in piedmont 
what you said before 
you don t believe the
infection in that capsule
was brought back deliberately  do you 
skip it  i hope
i m talking through my hat 
put your hands on
that glass  palms down 
it s a finger and palm
print analyzer  it   
reads a composite of 10 000
dermatographic lines 
how d you know that 
oh  dutton  i have a
long criminal record 
then you re in trouble 
this machine has a long memory 
it gives you final clearance
to enter wildfire 
isothermal
reading for m c  levels 4 and 5
is z b  and r a  over 2 9 
how s piedmont 
i had to order up a 7 12 
how are you  ruth 
no other way to halt
the infection spread 
oh 
oh  you two know
each other  don t you 
by reputation only 
ah  yes  up to now we ve
had to worship from a far 
be good  ruth 
any messages for me
from the white house 
not a thing  dr  stone  or you d have it 
no personal messages 
no  ma am 
nothing from dr  robertson 
are you sure  sergeant 
dr  stone  sir  i have
one thing to do  just one 
everything else is fully automatic 
computerized and self regulating 
i    i listen for a
little bell in here 
ding a ling  that
means a message
coming in is for the wildfire team 
precisely  an m c n  communication 
i m expecting one 
yes  sir  top priority 
ding a ling  i push a button
and all five level control
centers are notified
the same time you are 
the bell hasn t rung  sir 
thanks for the tour  sergeant 
dr  dutton  thank you 
will you follow me  dr  leavitt 
and may i have your glasses  please 
what for 
they ll be treated and
returned to you  doctor 
they better be 
or i ll need a white cane 
who picked leavitt 
talk about the odd man hypothesis 
which we haven t yet 
she s really an oddball 
we re lucky to have her 
she s the best equipped of us
to double up for kirke in microbiology 
when dressed 
the team will proceed
directly to conference room 7 
keep this with you at all times 
what s it for 
you re the odd man 
the key man  quite literally 
this other key 
and wildfire itself 
depend on your key 
wildfire s equipped
with a nuclear device
for self destruct 
in an emergency 
it s activated automatically 
i ve just inserted the
key in the main station
that arms the mechanism 
the device is ready for detonation 
when 
never  we hope 
it only goes off if there s danger
of infection breaking out from here 
that silver key can t be removed 
you re the only one
who can disarm the mechanism
by inserting your red key
in one of the substations
located throughout the facility 
there s a five minute delay
between the time detonation locks in
and the bomb explodes 
that gives
you a chance to think
and  please god  call it off 
look  i m the new boy here  why me 
because you re single 
you should have done
your homework  sport 
page 255  robbie s odd man hypothesis 
 results of testing confirm
the robertson odd man hypothesis 
that an unmarried male should
carry out command decisions
involving thermonuclear
destruct contexts  
let me take a look at that 
it s of vital importance
that you always know where you are
in relation to the nearest substation 
to do that  you have to be familiar
with the entire facility 
it can be studied on
this electronic diagram
which rotates to afford an overall view 
or can be stopped at any section 
detailed plans of the
various levels and labs
are also stored in the system 
we re on level 1 of a five story
cylindrical underground structure
surrounded by solid rock 
each level has three substations 
indicated by the yellow lights 
in the event the nuclear
device is triggered 
you can still cancel self destruct
by inserting your red
key in a substation 
after our last simulation run 
we decided to add two
more substations per level 
but they re not finished 
so don t confuse them
with functioning ones 
at the bottom of the central core
is the apparatus for self destruct 
each level is a different color
based on a navy study
of the psychological effects
of color in environments 
also  each level is bio medically cleaner
than the one above it 
we don t want anything
to contaminate a possible organism 
that would make it twice as hard
to isolate and characterize 
it ll take us 16 hours to descend
through the programmed
decontamination procedures
on the first four levels to level 5
where the main labs are 
where  exactly  are we now 
there s one way you can
always locate yourself
or any of us instantly 
simply by calling up projections
from the electronic diagram
on any video monitor
anywhere in wildfire 
views such as this 
this shows we re in
conference room 7  level 1 
each of us is indicated by our initial 
our movements are continuously monitored
on the electronic diagram 
where are the patients 
where s the capsule 
the patients are the yellow x s 
the red circle is the capsule 
on level 5  the patients
and capsule will be isolated
in biologically secure setups 
are you sure the old man
and the baby are still alive 
what are their chances  hall 
uncertain 
i m hoping the intravenous dextrose
and saline will hold them
until we get to them 
we start decontamination and
immunization procedures now 
you really expect me to fire the thing 
i m afraid you don t understand 
all you can do is stop it 
in a biological emergency 
the bomb is activated automatically 
it ll then go off within five minutes
unless you get to a substation
and lock in your key 
oh 
delta five to all levels 
we are checking out ray ban
emergency communications 
this is a test 
proceed to infrared radiation
decontamination room 1 d 
also it could be an organism
from another planet
released deliberately 
to wipe us out  really  charles 
just the opposite 
to make friendly contact 
a kind of messenger to show us
life exists elsewhere in the universe 
it could be benign in
its own environment 
pretty far fetched 
we can t ignore any possibility 
you are about to
undergo long wave radiation 
a buzzer will sound 
close your eyes and stand still
or blindness may result 
we face quite a problem 
how to disinfect the human body 
one of the dirtiest things
in the known universe 
that is without killing the
human being at the same time 
it gets tougher as we go 
hard on the taxpayers 
the way we burn up uniforms 
they re paper 
i d swear it was cloth 
new process 
where s the next substation  hall 
left of elevator on level 2 
right  across the corridor
from body analysis 
our next port of call 
not for my alabaster body 
i mean it  stone 
you can take your body
analyzer and you can   
sit down  please 
please look at the screen
in front of you 
please place your body so
that all points are obliterated 
that is fine  we may proceed 
state your name for the records 
surname first 
mark hall 
hall  mark 
thank you for your cooperation 
yes  dear 
please answer the
following questions yes or no 
have you any allergies 
yes  to ragweed pollen 
okay  i ll repeat for
your memory cells   
please repeat your response
for our memory cells 
ragweed pollen 
this ends the formal questioning 
please undress 
this is a scan for fungal lesions 
dr  stone  this is level 2 control 
the answer is affirmative 
major manchek contacted the white house
at 11 23 this morning 
contact on
all leads is  r  for ready 
do not be nervous 
i m not nervous 
physical parameters
are being measured 
there s no need to be nervous  dr  leavitt 
please raise your left arm 
please sit up  facing the scan screen
and watch carefully 
you have received pneumatic injections
of booster immunizations 
you may get dressed  thank you 
this recording is now ended 
that body analyzer 
i want to be there when
the a m a  gets wind of it 
so far it s only been used by nasa
to diagnose astronauts in space 
you doctors better start
making house calls again 
this is a xenon lamp apparatus 
to insure complete effectiveness 
spread your feet apart 
to protect scalp and facial hair 
place the metal helmet
securely on the head 
make sure the helmet is firmly seated
and the visor lowered 
then raise your arms and wait 
you may now remove helmet 
you will notice a fine
white ash on your body 
this is the outer epithelial
layers of your skin
that have been burned away 
please replace the helmet in compartment
and proceed through shower in next room 
then you may dress
and descend to level 4 
we re required to rest
for six hours on level 4
after exposure to the xenon lamp 
so go to your rooms and sleep 
at the end of the corridor
is the cafeteria 
we ll meet there at 0400 hours   
tomorrow

they refuse to believe
life exists in meteorites 
i showed them at the astrophysics
conference what i just showed you 
but no  even with a microscope 
they are blind 
what do i have to do 
hit them over the head 
i m glad you re amused  gentlemen 
but it might just turn out to be true 
during this symposium 
we ll discuss the possibility
that intelligent life
on a distant planet
may be no larger than a flea 
perhaps no larger
than a bacterium 
time to wake up  sir 
time to wake up  sir 
hello 
time to wake up  sir 
who are you 
time to wake up  sir 
do you wish something  sir 
your name 
will that be all  sir 
for the moment 
this is the answering

we wish you would adopt
a more serious attitude  dr  hall 
sorry  her voice is quite luscious 
the voice belongs to miss gladys stevens
who is 63 years old 
she lives in omaha and makes her living
taping messages for
voice reminder systems 
much obliged 
let s not get sidetracked
on rudolph karp
and his meteorite theories 
his technique was worthless 
i still think we should contact him 
fair enough  where is he 
behind the iron curtain 
he couldn t get a research grant here

eight ounces satisfy all daily
nutritional requirements 
except coffee 
and lipid soluble vitamins 
for that we have these 
help yourself 
so what s the point
of the cafeteria 
wildfire isn t always on crash status 
maybe there s some sugar 
nope 
nothing that might provide
a bacterial growth medium 
precisely  no sugar in the gut 
i d like a cigarette right now 
it s after meals you miss them 
you should have no trouble on level 5 
you won t even get
this close to a meal 
we ll be entirely on
high protein nutrients 
i planned our work in three stages 
one  detection 
first step is to confirm
that an organism is present 
two  characterization 
how is it structured 
how does it work 
three  control 
how to contain and exterminate 
jeremy  on this matter of extermination 
we should go slowly 
without ever realizing it 
we might destroy a highly
intelligent form of life 
why don t we get going 
i ve got two patients down there 
the team has two subjects 
they re not guinea pigs  stone 
you may now
proceed to level 5  gentlemen 
stop by your rooms and insert these
before taking the elevator 
i have risked drowning
in that foul bath 
i have been parboiled 
irradiated and xenon flashed 
and now you suggest i   
i have to 
we haven t done anything

off the main
corridor on the outer rim
are the living quarters 
conference room 
cafeteria  bio safety maintenance  etc 
inside are the labs 
where is the library 
no need for books 
everything s in the computer 
notice the capsule has
already been delivered
by the sterile conveyor system
to the main control lab here 
your patients are here
in the hot room of miscellaneous 
we can t have any
direct contact with them 
poor souls 
dr  dutton
and dr  hall are wanted
in main control immediately 
hey 
if the patients are sealed off 
how do i get to them 
ever used a glove box 
no 
wildfire s gone a step further 
whole rooms that operate
like glove boxes 
you ll be working in one shortly 
we have a magnetic  k  indices 
give us a code 3 when you get it 
i wanted you here
while we find out
if there s anything still
biologically active in the capsule 
suggestions 
use a buffalo 
audio 
detectors  e 
through  g  correction 
negative  n  scan 
negative  n  scope in l y 1 
affirmative   n  indicator in mp 4 
i will repeat 
negative  n  scan 
negative  n  scope in l y 1 
affirmative 
 n  indicator in mp 4 
whatever killed them at piedmont
is still there and
still as potent as ever 
if potent s the word 
let s try a rhesus 
yeah  we ll want
a postmortem on it anyway 
housekeeping to level 5 
clean sweep schedule  b  now in effect 
germ free animal technicians 
please consult schedule 
so  okay 
isolate and identify 
right  you and i ll scan
the capsule  ruth 
charlie  you work on these in autopsy 
open the s l   ruth 
adjust s  y  system
for aseptricity as follows 
points 2 a at 5 
points 9 through 12 at plus 1 
plus 3  plus 6 at minus 
run an initial vector study  charlie 
find out how the disease
enters the body 
charlie 
yes 
yes  the vector study first 
then autopsy  incredible 
dutton  be careful 
let our distinguished surgeon
handle the knife 
fine  but not for a while 
first  i m a pediatrician
and a geriatrist 
take it easy 
charlie will have a technician 
what s been done for them 
just plasma for the old man 
dextrose for the baby 
your therapy 
no  medcom s 
do i call you miss medcom 
if you like  dr  hall 
my name s karen anson 
good  i couldn t cope with two machines 
how does this work 
you re lucky 
medcom s got one of the best minds here 
it s a medical data analyzer
that can diagnose as well as prescribe 
it s hooked up to the
main computer on level 1 
every console and
instrument in wildfire
is plugged into the main computer
on a time sharing basis 
all our key lab studies
are done on automated machines 
i prefer the personal touch 
it s hard to come
by in those suits 
have you worked in them 
not for real 
but i ve been drilling for three months 
thank god for an expert 
this sort of thing s new to me 
it s new to all of us 
until now  wildfire s been like a game 
we ve even had simulation
biowar games here
with live subjects    volunteers 
i mean  i m scared 
i never believed
this could really happen 
well  it has happened 
i ll need some lab tests 
use this to check off
what you want 
just touch the pen to the screen 
you draw the bloods 
i ll do the physicals 
use the bar 
the tunnel seals off
automatically behind you 
the only way you might possibly
break your suit is with a scalpel 
and a surgeon isn t likely to do that 
bio safety to s l 
an animal in airlock 0 9 5 
reconfirm red r d p 
status before transfer 
second scan completed 
score  nothing to nothing 
go to 100 power 
no  ruth 
use only one micro scanner 
you being paid by the hour 
we could cover the capsule
in one half the time 
there s less chance of missing something
when we both concentrate on one screen 
let s go directly to the inside 
we can assume they put
the scoop on the thing
to scoop something into it 
they sure got what
they were looking for 
we re not here to make accusations 
we have a job to do
purely as scientists 
maybe not so pure 
continue the scan  ruth  on the outside 
no  don t do that 
we ll use the hands 
nothing can happen  sir 
i m faster than the hands 
i want you out of the hot room 
b z  doris to i z  alice 
s d t  energy output
is 1 8 to 3 0 joules
with rate two to three milliradians 
and we still need those blankets 
no sweat  sir 
those cages are airtight 
i wish you would sweat
a little more  toby 
sweat is a safeguard against some
kinds of bacteria and carelessness 
use the hands 
wow 
transmitted by air  as we thought 
now we ve got to determine its size 
could be a gas or some kind of a virus 
we ll use a hundred
angstrom filter to begin 
about the size of a small virus 
all systems go  sir 
whatever it is 
it s larger than a virus 
we ll try a one micron filter 
hang in there  baby 
he must be pretty big 
i m gonna get me a fly swatter 
do that 
here goes with two microns 
uh huh 
nasty 
at least we ll be able
to get a good look at it 
dutton to stone 
we ve just found out its size 
about two microns in diameter 
big enough to be a complete cell 
interesting 
there s a good chance it s alive 
airborne transmission 
yes  what have you found 
so far nothing 
our nobel laureate here
won t scan on the inside
because he says   
all right  ruth 
thanks  charlie  keep at it 
it s pointless to go on scanning outside 
if it s two microns in diameter 
it would ve showed up at 440 
true  but we didn t know
that before  did we 
we ll start with five power on the inside 
stick to established procedure 
establishment gonna
fall down and go boom 
switch to manual  ruth 
the interior s too irregular
to probe on automatic 
more light  huh 
here s his blood value now 
half normal  severely anemic 
wake up  sir 
can you hear me 
what s your name 
jackson 
what 
jackson 
stay awake  mr  jackson 
stay awake 
tongue blade 
sixty eight degrees on 1 4 0 7 
sixty one on 1 2 0 3 
loss rate is minus 0 0 12 
please copy and confirm
all receiving locks 
you can tell you re a bachelor 
what was that 
i didn t say anything 
we re doing an isotope scan 
how the bugs get into the body 
thought you should watch it 
i assume it was inhaled 
not likely it s absorbed
through the skin 
that s what we ll find out now 
the mechanism of death 
we ll look at a
replay of that at speed 6 
that tells us
what we want to know  hall 
the organism is inhaled 
the clotting begins in the lungs
and spreads outward 
i didn t think it possible 
i didn t think the total volume
of blood could solidify that fast 
i hoped maybe one crucial clot
might form in the brain 
which was what made them go insane 
and then the rest of the
blood clot more slowly 
we d have a chance to cure that 
cure what 
we don t know what it is 
stone and leavitt haven t been
able to isolate the hellish thing 
of course they will in time 
of course 
hold it 
at the edge of that
shadow  i think   
me too 
it s an indentation 
yes  about the
size of a pencil point 
go to 40 
go to 60 
jeremy  do you think maybe   
maybe it s
just a grain of sand 
go to 80 
what about the bits of green 
paint  for god s sake 
pistachio ice cream 
there s no basis to
assume it s anything yet 
you re too good a scientist not to
be thinking the same thing i am 
if this is
really something new 
some brand new form of life   
the best hope of cracking it
is to be grindingly thorough
with the help of computer number one 
okay  now let s get on with it 
hold it 
more pistachio 
i count four patches 
keep going 
i ll computerize the coordinates 
let s take a look
at the rock at 100 
i doubt that s what
knocked the capsule off trajectory 
unless the rock was going
at tremendous speed 
or unless it s terribly heavy 
for pete s sake  ruth 
it can t be that heavy 
hall and i could lift the capsule 
however  it s possible the
rock is different in space 
out there it might do anything 
maybe it has elastic properties
we don t even know yet 
let s have a look
at the green patches 
they must ve come off the rock 
if it is rock 
you know something 
they do look like spatters of paint 
let s go back to the rock
and see it at 440 
if that s a meteor 
it s a damn peculiar one 
this left border over here 
it s smooth  almost like
an artificial surface 
painted  maybe 
luminous paint 
if i keep watching it 
i might think so 
wet paint sign and all 
jeremy 
what 
nothing 
you okay 
it s just my eyes are tired 
we ve been at it five hours straight 
we ll take a caffeine
break in a minute 
first i d like to see one of the
separate patches of green at 1 000 
did you see that 
i saw it 
you didn t change the lighting 
i didn t touch it 
looks alive 
yes 
it s bigger than two microns 
which means the infection is spread
by a mere fraction of the green 
i m bringing down cameras 
let s have the other micro scanner 
stone to level control 
i need a mic t 
roger  will send 
jump it up to 1500 
microscan doesn t go any higher 
we can get 1500 light
magnification in micro chemistry 
i ll send the rock through 
attention
c l t  s on levels 4 and 5 
main computer shows capacity
versus access time
at ten to the twelfth bits 
for any change in memory configuration 
c l t  s must check their unicorn op 
beautiful  sir 
i m the mic t 
you re real sharp on the hands 
thanks  nice to know one
hasn t lost one s touch 
the next step is to find out
what makes it grow 
we ll need samples from the scoop
to send through maxcult
for culture and isolation 
roger  sir  in work 
good god 
it s growing 
not so good 
naturally he has acidosis 
his blood ph was nine points off normal 
but why  stupid machine 
what makes his blood too acid 
ask the patient 
bio safety to s l   sectors 3 and 6 
give us a code 3 when you get it 
mr  jackson 
now  don t be scared 
i m a doctor 
bull 
where am i 
a special laboratory in nevada 
we brought you here from piedmont 
you re sick 
it s this damn stomach of mine 
bleeding 
hell  yes  bleeding 
bleeding in your stomach 
you have an ulcer 
damn tooting  two years 
but you must have pain 
what do you do for it 
aspirin   
and squeeze 
squeeze  what s that 
ain t gonna tell you 
so you re a sterno drinker  huh 
works good 
give him squeeze 
what s the baby s name  mr  jackson 
you the nurse 
uh huh 
shoot 
can t see your legs 
do you know the baby s name 
give us a butt first 
smoking isn t allowed here 
then go fish 
yeah 
when you re finished 
we ll transfuse jackson
and start ice water lavage 
he has a two year history
of bleeding ulcers 
you seem delighted 
it may be the reason he survived 
if only our young gourmet
weren t so normal 
well  let s hope
nothing changes that 
we might have to
before this is over 
they should ve dropped the bomb 
they should ve dropped it
two days ago  general 
this phantom crashed a good 60 miles
beyond the cordoned area 
men on the ground can t
cordon off airspace  sir 
i just don t understand
why the wildfire team
hasn t beefed about
the delay in 7 12 
it s been almost 24 hours 
and not a word from them 
i don t think piedmont had anything
to do with this crash  manchek 
it was a fluke 
that plane was only over the w f  area
for two minutes at 23 000 feet 
it s a routine training
mission accident  i bet you 
pilot error 
let s go 
check with wildfire
message center  delta five 
make sure everything there is nominal 
send me word on scrambler
at big head crash base 
okay 
checklim program completed 
all circuit banks nominal 
same thing on the m c n  console  captain 
just a minute  dr  robertson 
you re saying stone s
 90 million facility 
which you recommended 
was knocked out
by a sliver of paper 
you tell that to the taxpayers 
these were highly trained
electronics men  senator 
looking for an electronic fault 
the trouble was purely mechanical
of the simplest kind 
but for them  it was like trying to see
an elephant through a microscope 
the sliver had peeled from the roll
and wedged between the bell and striker 
preventing the bell from ringing 
i m convinced we re
being held incommunicado 
very flattering 
we don t know much more
than when we got here 
we know about scoop now 
it s possible what scoop
found was no accident 
i suspect they were looking for
the ultimate biological weapon 
sounds like you re getting
a little paranoid in this fun house 
what does stone think
about the ultimate weapon  i mean 
we ve isolated the organism 
it s in micro chemistry 
we ll show you 
watchdog
to electrical support   
all right  lieutenant 
albuquerque
center  this is air force 561 
go ahead 561 
my air hose is coming apart   
like it s dissolving 
everything made of rubber
is coming apart 
i feel funny 
it s a fluke  a vibration effect maybe 
let s get up there 
has wildfire been informed 
you mean the germ people 
it went out to them on
the scrambler an hour ago 
this they can t ignore 
i  b  control
to cafeteria level 3 
number 4 charlie hatch
shows condition blue 
alter responsivity characteristics
until you get condition green 
ready 
nothing so unusual
about our rock after all 
hydrogen  carbon  oxygen 
sulfur  silicon  et cetera 
except the black rock
isn t rock at all 
it s some kind of material
similar to plastic 
how about that 
the green is even simpler 
hydrogen  carbon 
nitrogen and oxygen 
the four basic elements
of life on earth  nothing else 
that s a relief 
i d have been happier
if it d turned out not to be alive 
green stuff 
you really had us going for a while 
a  a  analysis results
are ready  dr  dutton 
something s wrong 
it s not registering 
yes it is  sir 
it s just registering
double zero  double zero 
we ll switch to computerized analysis 
no amino acids 
no proteins  no
enzymes  no nucleic acid 
impossible  no organism
can maintain life without them 
you mean  no earth organism 
it must have evolved in
a totally different way 
you got it 
it doesn t come from here 
without chemical reactions
there can t be life 
yet it grows  reproduces   
wait 
the infection at piedmont
has been stopped by the bomb 
we re secure at wildfire 
we have everything we need
to achieve a breakthrough 
all we have to do is attack this
problem like any other in science 
you could spend years
working on a thing like that
without solving its structure 
but when you do  there ll be
some red faces around 
it could change everything 
great 
ruth  since kirke isn t here 
you take over the growth
program in microbiology 
we re halfway home if we find out
what will keep that from growing 
charlie  you work with
me on the e m  hall   
all right 
let me get back to my patients 
i m sure they were
protected by the same thing 
some simple mechanism
i just don t recognize yet 
there s got to be something
that the old man and
baby have in common 
oh  hall 
five minutes 
you told me before 
yes  we wouldn t want you to get
too far from the substation now 
men  keep a
sharp eye open for pieces of rubber 
i ll repeat that for you 
keep a sharp eye open
for pieces of rubber 
major 
major manchek 
take a look at that  sir 
we just found this  general 
it s a human bone 
arm  i think 
it looks picked clean 
almost like it was polished 
that s right 
well  i don t get it 
there is no actual rubber
on the phantom f 4  general 
it s all a synthetic plastic
compound called polycron 
it has some of the characteristics
of human skin 
what the hell is that 
what s left of his oxygen mask 
it s made of polycron 
i d say it was done
by a chemical reaction
of some sort 
or maybe a microorganism 
meaning 
meaning there was something
in that plane that consumes plastic 
how s maxcult coming  ruth 
will you be finished by
the midnight conference 
easy 
good  you can give us
the results then 
feeling better  aren t you  mr  jackson 
yep 
do you always have
to wear that iron suit 
yep 
maybe you ll tell us
the baby s name now 
mr  jackson 
manuel rios  mex 
real little heller 
squalls morning  noon and night 
neighbors wouldn t let them
keep their windows open 
do you sleep with your window closed 
no sirree  bob 
fresh air fiend 
tell us what happened  mr  jackson 
i don t want to think about it 
you know what people will say 
piedmont was bad 
that s why it was punished 
first the town went crazy
and then was destroyed 
you re crazy 
folks at piedmont was good 
decent  normal folks 
the man we found dressed up
in his dough boy s uniform 
call that normal 
pete arnold  who worked at the store 
it was the disease 
how do you know 
 cause the only thing wrong with him
before that night was sugar 
diabetes  did he take insulin 
a couple of times a day 
hated the needle 
i tried to talk him
into using squeeze 
insulin  if he missed his
treatment  he d go   
thanks  mr  jackson 
oh  my god 
central c c 
to big p c  control  all levels 
testing laser system 
please maintain random fringe drift
within ten percent of initial value 
dr  leavitt  you have
a midnight conference 
the signal has struck twice 
i heard 
i heard  i ve been busy 
the important thing is
something can slow it down 
i think it s some kind
of blood disorder 
if the old soldier missed
his insulin treatment 
he d go into acidosis 
the same as jackson on sterno 
i ll bet leavitt finds the
organism shows no growth
on some of the blood cultures 
what s wrong
with the baby s blood 
nothing    so far 
then you re back where you started 
no  somehow they re all interrelated 
i ll have the answer when i know
why a 69 year old sterno drinker
with an ulcer is like a normal
six month old baby 
did you get any no growth readouts   
no  but i m not finished yet 
you told me you d be finished 
i decided to play part of it back 
what for  the first
time around should be   
knock it off  hall 
wait  wait 
we re all tired 
tired people make mistakes 
they draw wrong conclusions 
they drop things 
that mustn t happen 
starting now  i want the team to get
six hours sleep out of every 24 
suits me 
before turning in 
shouldn t we file for a code name 
yeah  good idea 
nine over 4 over 8
under 167 29 
auto check in grade 
why andromeda 
andromeda s our   
stone 
 directive 7 12 has not been acted upon 
alternative directive 7 11 now in effect  
they didn t drop the bomb 
it s an m c n  transmission sent yesterday 
idiots 
put me through to dr  robertson 
in work  sir 
burke  you didn t special alert
an m c n  message to us 
there haven t been any  sir 
the bell didn t ring   
don t argue  damn it 
i ve got one in my hand 
well  well  about time
we heard from you 
there has been a communications foul up 
never mind that now 
why hasn t that bomb
been dropped on piedmont 
the decision on 7 12 isn t final 
it was just postponed 48 hours 
by then the disease could spread
into a worldwide epidemic 
it s because of rash
statements like that
the president doesn t trust scientists 
warn the president
it may already be too late 
stay on his back  robbie 
you ve got to make him call a 7 12 
can you get me another
appointment tonight  grimes 
now let s all just keep
our heads screwed on 
any thoughts about
the phantom crash 
we sent you a couple messages on it 
a phantom jet strayed over the
cordoned area around piedmont 
any other information 
well  the pilot said   
that all the rubber on
the plane was dissolving 
his last communication was pretty weird 
like he was crazy 
he was mighty confused  that s for sure 
robbie  it s your job
to get the president
to activate a 7 12 immediately 
if he doesn t  there s no guarantee
anyone west of piedmont
will be alive in the morning 
simmer down  professor 
i ll wake the boss 
but general sparks says
the crash was just a fluke 
forget the crash  robbie 
stay on that 7 12 and get back to me 
we ll be working around the clock 
that s a good slice 
it s too thick 
i m setting it at 800 angstroms 
and i m going to a higher magnification 
now we re getting somewhere 
yeah 
but these can t be more
than a few molecules in depth 
that s the one  that silver one 
this is a villabach alert 
all levels 
this is a villabach alert 
electromagnetic waves are not
registering on the d l r 
sample in the button
and sealed  charlie 
start the vacuum pump 
stone  can i see you 
i have the results
of the growth cultures 
no  we can t leave now 
we have an andromeda cell in the e m 
okay  charlie  let s
put it on the screen 
let s run it through the computer
for contrast expansion 
stone 
what do you think 
it looks like a crystal 
well  gentlemen  there s our answer 
to what 
how andromeda functions
without amino acids 
crystalline structure 
yes 
i ve often thought
that living matter
might be based on
crystals of some kind 
all these wedge shaped compartments 
they d serve to separate
biochemical functions very well 
it s dividing 
in a vacuum  bombarded by electrons 
it shouldn t even be alive 
that s what i wanted to tell you 
the growth program shows
andromeda can live on anything 
only gas and light affect it 
you didn t get any no growth
results on the cultures 
none  look 
the poorest growth
occurs in pure oxygen
incubated under infrared light 
andromeda grows best in
carbon dioxide and hydrogen
incubated under x rays 
no excretions 
no waste of any kind 
you d expect that 
andromeda s perfect
for existence in outer space 
consumes everything  wastes nothing 
good lord  stone to delta five 
put me through to robertson immediately 
what 
god  i hope we re not too late 
tell me 
it functions like an atomic reactor 
an atomic blast could provide it
with enough energy to grow
into a gigantic super colony 
in one day 
you can relax now 
we ve just left the president 
he agreed to drop the bomb 
no  you ve got to stop 7 12
from being carried out 
now  wait a minute 
we re not playing ping pong 
we just got through
telling the president   
for god s sake  go back 
it grows when exposed to x rays
or any source of energy 
tell him no nuclear device
must be detonated anywhere near it 
we just found out andromeda works
like a little reactor 
converts matter to energy 
energy to matter directly 
then the bomb would only provide
a fantastically rich growth medium 
understand 
no  but i ll pass along
the recommendation 
the boss will be pleased to know
that he made the right decision
on 7 12 in the first place 
congratulate him
on his scientific insight 
and  robbie 
you d better get the
atomic self destruct in here
disarmed as soon as possible 
right  i ll start on the clearances now 
it ll be done by morning 
no  no  no 
that won t work until
the damn thing s going 
all the molecules
appear to be the same 
yes 
andromeda isn t composed
of different substances
like a normal cell 
all the subunits are the same 
damndest thing i ve ever s   
boy  a single substance 
then how the
hell does it operate 
how does anything so simple
utilize energy for growth 
no way of telling
from that structure 
yes  there is 
with this new data 
we can get a computerized version
of how andromeda functions 
they re not uniform 
could be mutations 
what the devil 
601 
the computer s overloaded 
too much data coming in too fast 
dividing and mutating
at the same time 
and nothing to stop it 
normal earth checks and
balances don t exist for it 
we d better get a bio math mapping
of its new growth potential and spread 
according to this 
there ll be a super colony
of andromeda over the
entire southwest   
jeremy  these are
biological warfare maps 
why  yes  so they are 
oh  but simulations  charlie 
defensive  it s just a scenario 
that s not the point 
for god s sake 
wildfire was built
for germ warfare 
wildfire and scoop 
and you knew  stone 
you knew it 
that s not true  ruth 
i learned about scoop
the same time you did 
they already have
andromeda programmed 
the purpose of scoop was to find
new biological weapons in outer space 
and then use wildfire to develop them 
it stinks 
you re blowing your tops 
we have no proof 
the map 
don t be an ass 
that map only shows what andromeda
could do in the hands of an enemy 
enemy  we did it to ourselves 
perhaps  but this is hardly the time
to organize a protest 
another giant leap for mankind 
i wish i could believe you 
whether you do or not 
the only important thing now
is to find the antidote 
let s get on with it  charlie 
test the cultured organisms
for biologic potency 
all right  i ll run them
against a rat in autopsy 
i want to seal up the capsule 
watch it 
andromeda s altered 
its effect might be radically different 
i ll try to get us a photo
of the mutated form 
photo lab to red map 
the offbeat access reference
reads at 649 f  1 500 
please copy 
this may be the key
to beating andromeda 
how  by starving him to death 
no  but don t feed him until i tell you 
contamination 
a seal has broken in autopsy 
emergency procedures are in effect 
what s the matter 
infection spread  autopsy 
is he alive 
i should ve been with him  dr  dutton 
it s no use  it s sealed off 
dr  hall 
she s in trouble 
ruth  are you   
she s got the germ 
someone bring 100 milligrams
of phenobarb in a syringe fast 
there s no danger 
she isn t contagious 
there s no danger 
   to l 5 
p  i  e  and e  t  e 
your second quarter rest
period has been canceled 
time r a  has been reassigned
according to crash program 
come on 
come on  she can t hurt you 
wasn t she with dr  dutton 
no  it s epilepsy 
give her the injection 
she ll be all right 
good girl  thanks 
i m scared 
oh  lord  i m scared 
you ll be okay  charlie 
we re pumping pure oxygen
through your lab now 
we know andromeda
doesn t do well in oxygen 
he s alive 
where have you been 
leavitt had a seizure 
what 
epilepsy  the red light
flashing at 3 per second
brought on a fit 
why in the hell didn t
she tell us about it 
no top lab would have her if they knew 
insurance  prejudice  all that crap 
from the middle ages 
amazing he s still alive 
well  it s been three minutes 
he s on pure oxygen 
i don t know how long that can hold him 
we re  working on some ideas  charlie 
ask your germ warfare friends 
they have lots 
try to stay calm 
what happened 
seal must ve broken in there 
they had the same thing at the lunar lab 
that s why we use polycron gaskets here 
at least the rest of wildfire is secure 
poor devil 
look at the way he s breathing 
he s scared to death 
that oxygen should relax him 
slow down his breathing 
no  we want him to breathe fast 
in piedmont  jackson
was crocked on sterno 
sterno acidosis 
acidosis  rapid breathing 
what the hell you doing 
turn off the oxygen 
put him on room air 
the baby  he s normal 
cries all the time 
can t catch his breath 
rapid breathing 
it just can t be that simple 
it isn t 
dutton  i think rapid breathing helps 
don t let the bug in
your lungs long enough
to penetrate blood vessels 
i want to turn off the pure oxygen 
then you start breathing
room air as fast as you can 
no  no 
i was running a test in here 
the air is thick with andromeda 
experiment with your own life  damn it 
we won t do it  charlie 
take it easy 
i know i m close 
i m sure it has something to do
with blood chemistry and breathing 
dr  hall  may i please
feed the baby now 
he s been crying steadily   
that s what i want  keep him crying 
run another blood value on him 
get his ph measurements 
yes  doctor 
with all the yelling 
blowing off carbon dioxide 
the kid should have too little acid 
alkaline  a blood condition just
the opposite from the old man 
too much alkali 
well  what good does that do dutton 
karen  where s the blood test 
it s coming through now on your console 
hell of a way to run a hospital 
just what you expected 
opposite blood chemistries 
the baby and the old man 
one of them should
be a dead opposite   
but he s not 
there must be a connection 
they both stayed alive at piedmont
breathing the same air 
one s blood too alkaline 
the other too    acid 
yes  yes 
dutton  i m turning off the oxygen 
breathe fast and hard 
no  jeremy 
don t let him cut off my oxygen 
no  the air in that room is loaded   
air doesn t matter 
blood does  that s the answer 
i need 30 seconds
to run a growth program 
he could die in 30 seconds 
besides  leavitt checked
all the growth programs 
she might have missed something 
epileptics blank out 
i want to see how the
growth of andromeda
is affected by blood
chemistry  the ph   
oh  damn 
you do it 
excellent 
the graph s practically
straight up and down 
that means andromeda can only exist
within a narrow range of ph 
a very narrow range 
on either side of the
tolerance range  no growth 
nothing  right 
it s exterminated 
dutton  our troubles are over 
look at your console 
it grows within
a narrow range of ph 
a very narrow range 
if your blood s abnormal 
if it s too acid or alkaline 
andromeda can t survive
in the body 
so breathe as fast as you can 
go into respiratory alkalosis 
yes  fine 
that ll shoot your
blood chemistry to hell 
it s what happens to the baby
when he cries too much 
or the old man on sterno 
how do you feel 
okay 
a little dizzy  but okay 
he can t keep breathing
like that forever 
he ll hyperventilate  pass out 
we ve got to get him something
to alkalize his blood 
we can t in there 
charlie 
that cage    in the hot room 
right in front of you 
it s alive 
the rat s been exposed as long as i have 
longer  i exposed it to the cultures
before the seal broke 
precisely 
andromeda s mutated
to a noninfectious form 
holy 
where does that gasket lead 
central core 
it connects all the labs 
the gaskets are decomposing 
it s andromeda 
next sector 
there s no substation in this sector 
level 5 is sealed 
emergency procedures are in effect 
when the bomb goes off 
there ll be a thousand mutations 
andromeda will spread everywhere 
they ll never be rid of it 
there are now five
minutes to self destruct 
what about the other levels 
can t tell  each sector seals off
when it s contaminated 
even the elevator 
the defense system is perfect 
it ll even bury our mistakes 
what about the central core 
the core s equipped with safeguards 
like what 
gas  lasers 
to prevent escape of lab animals 
what would my chances be 
they don t exist for anyone
anywhere if you stay here 
how do i get into the core 
through that service port 
go ahead 
i ll ride shotgun for
you in main control 
i can t monitor the lasers here 
karen  get me a scalpel 
there are now four minutes
and 30 seconds to self destruct 
cut it off 
cut the panel off 
karen  cut it 
come on  hurry up 
hey  doc  you ain t leaving
us here  are you 
the lasers are tuned low
for small animals  mark 
you can make it if you re not
hit along the spinal cord 
there are now
four minutes to self destruct 
that s the
ladder across from you 
go before the gas starts 
there are now three minutes
and 30 seconds to self destruct 
that s the gas  keep going 
the sensors have picked you up 
get moving 
duck 
keep going 
duck 
keep going 
duck 
there are now
three minutes to self destruct 
no  it s no good 
the level s contaminated 
you ll have to go to 3 
go to 3 
there are now two minutes
and 45 seconds to self destruct 
sway  weave 
you re zeroed in  duck 
there are now two minutes
and 30 seconds to self destruct 
keep going  you ll make it 
there are now two minutes
and 15 seconds to self destruct 
fight the effect  it s mostly shock 
you ve lost some time 
but you can still do it 
see the door 
there are now two
minutes to self destruct 
there is now one minute and
45 seconds to self destruct 
there is now one minute and
30 seconds to self destruct 
there is now   
you re in an airlock 
turn the wheel 
   one minute and 15
seconds to self destruct 
no  not that one 
the one near the door 
there are now
60 seconds to self destruct 
there are now 55 seconds to self destruct 
there are now 50 seconds to self destruct 
where is it 
there are now 45 seconds to self destruct 
come on  where is it 
help me 
there are now 40 seconds to self destruct 
there are now 35 seconds to self destruct 
there are now 30 seconds to self destruct 
there are now 25 seconds to self destruct 
twenty seconds 
19  18  17 
16 15 
14 13 12 
11 10  9   
self destruct has been canceled 
congratulations 
i take it the bomb didn t   
no  it didn t 
eight seconds to spare 
hardly even exciting 
what s happening 
the super colony s now off the coast
and moving southwest across the pacific 
apparently andromeda
hasn t turned lethal again 
at least there haven t been
any reports of bizarre deaths 
we re applying an adaptation
of your antidote to it 
cloud seeding 
we re seeding the clouds above andromeda
with silver iodide 
the raindrops will carry the
organism into the ocean 
and the alkaline reaction
from seawater should kill it 
just as acids or alkali
in the blood stopped it 
this cloud seeding business 
you absolutely sure it worked 
you better be 
all reports indicate
the experiment was successful 
then we can feel confident
your so called
biological crisis is over 
as far as andromeda s concerned  yes 
we have the organism at wildfire
and we continue to study it 
we now know beyond a doubt
that other forms of life
exist in the universe 
thanks to scoop 
yes 
however  with this new knowledge 
there s no guarantee
that another so called biological crisis
