im fine
relax
im going
skin knife
hold mark
sorry disturb
theres call
dr robertson
white house
orders break scrub
orders ive got patient ready
kelly take
arranged
youre expected surgeons room seconds
sure satellite isnt radioactive
manchek showed telemetry reports
presumably could form space germ
presumably stuff nonporous
pick
youre md talented surgeon
knows blood chemistries
youre single
odd man hypothesis
hell
didnt read wildfire material
ive sending
little
never went much science fiction

seems general
dr stone put one
fact made us think
wildfire lab could handle
contamination outer space
disagree senator vermont
dr stone nobel prize winner
twice president national academy sciences
well known washington
implication dr stone
deliberately misled us
perhaps deliberately senator
im reasonably certain
night
wildfire team mobilized
dr stone didnt know scoop existed
im astounded
reasons national security
smart
weve experiences scientists
lets talk famous letter
dr stone sent president
two years ago
youre saying
shot dark
perhaps thats little unfair senator
dr stone consultants nasa
lunar receiving lab
wasnt completely satisfied
felt advanced lab required
mean expensive dont
call dr stones million mash note uncle sam
true biological crisis
exploration space could bring
present lunar receiving laboratory
might prove inadequate
therefore urge
establishment facility
deal specifically
extraterrestrial form life
purpose facility
would limit dissemination
unknown organism
outer space
provide laboratories
analysis
recommend facility located
uninhabited region
united states
utilize known isolation techniques
equipped nuclear device
selfdestruction event
emergency
truly jeremy stone
dont encourage president
think scientists wizards
things get control
might
even cant work miracles
id expect help charlie
piedmont approaching gentlemen
go give us look first dempsey
afraid
birdsll eat infected flesh
fly spread disease
disease
drop gas canisters
someones supposed alive
somebody something
thats sure
lets give double dose
gas kill birds
okay dempsey hover main street
drop ladder
attempt land
clear
roger clearer time
climb lift feet
hover safe distance
come back signal
anything happens us
orders
yes sir proceed directly wildfire
eliminated
aircraft pilot
sterilized
wait minute
thats told
incinerated
coronary

look
air force jet
dont make wildfire
hell see helicopter
shoot
well dempseys sake
better slip
day judgment hand
mercy soul
hell others amen
senile
took time
regardless made
took time
theres chance someones still alive
wouldnt believe could commit suicide way
died instantly
time go quietly nuts
lets find damn satellite
injury isnt bleeding
cut like torn veins
broken capillaries bleed like hell
yes well theres blood

even chewed bleeding
hold hold
youd better back
got ta go left
damn close bear right
ill bet took doctor

damn fool opened
yeah every country doctor
run office
like lunar lab
capsule first hall
weve got minutes oxygen left
look buttocks
thats funny
meant
normally blood dead person
goes lowest points
marks lividity
see purplish marks butt

careful dont puncture suit
clotted blood
powdered
ill damned
wonder didnt bleed
clotted throughout entire system
five quarts blood turned powder
theory suppose
single organism could
fact isnt organism earth
mean didnt used
dont
heard right
go away go back
get back get go back
get away
must mother
hes scared hungry hell
cant six months
theres probably formula kitchen
dont feed
hasnt eaten least hours
dont anything

maybe hadnt eaten lasted longest
whatever oxygen running
cant take chance
wait minute

town must neutralized immediately
president made decision
directive yet
doesnt jump things dr robertson
first ive got put together briefing
presidents main concern
international consequences
think mr secretary
moscow treaty
fire thermonuclear weapons ground
russians privately informed
going cauterize area
theyll ask flock questions
dont want answered
thatll take hours
god knows far infection spread time
yes chief
yes sir
yes mr president
presidents decided
postpone directive
hours
instead hell call national guard
cordon area around piedmont
thats department ed
safe sound
shouldve left
scientists
colossal mistake
tell president said

ill get appointment
whose decision general
site wildfire chosen
dr stones
seemed ideal remoteness
inhabited area
near wildfire radius miles
las vegas north
phoenix south
los angeles west
werent worried
infection might spread
yes sir
dr stone dr robertson
assured president
wildfire foolproof
device
atomic selfdestruct
military take backseat
least couldve sent licensed driver
meet crummy airstrip
keep personnel minimum
obvious reasons
youre lost

hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen
four basic elements life earth nothing else
thats relief
id happier

green stuff
really us going
analysis results ready dr dutton
somethings wrong
registering
yes sir
registering doublezero doublezero
well switch computerized analysis
amino acids
proteins enzymes nucleic acid
impossible organism maintain life without
mean earth organism
must evolved totally different way
got
doesnt come
without chemical reactions cant life
yet grows reproduces
wait
infection piedmont
stopped bomb
secure wildfire
everything need achieve breakthrough
attack problem like science
could spend years
working thing like
without solving structure
therell

idiots
put dr robertson
work sir
burke didnt special alert
mcn message us
havent sir
bell didnt ring
dont argue damn
ive got one hand
well well time heard
communications foulup
never mind
hasnt bomb dropped piedmont
decision isnt final
postponed hours
disease could spread
worldwide epidemic
rash statements like
president doesnt trust scientists
warn president may already late
stay back robbie
youve got make call
get another appointment tonight grimes
lets keep heads screwed
thoughts phantom crash
sent couple messages
phantom jet strayed cordoned area around piedmont
information
well pilot said
rubber plane dissolving
last communication pretty weird
like crazy
mighty confused thats sure
robbie job get president
activate immediately
doesnt theres guarantee
anyone west piedmont
alive morning
simmer professor
ill wake boss
general sparks says crash fluke

cant leave
andromeda cell em
okay charlie lets put screen
lets run computer
contrast expansion
stone
think
looks like crystal
well gentlemen theres answer

andromeda functions without amino acids
crystalline structure
yes
ive often thought living matter
might based crystals kind
wedgeshaped compartments
theyd serve separate
biochemical functions well
dividing
vacuum bombarded electrons
shouldnt even alive
thats wanted tell
growth program shows
andromeda live anything
gas light affect
didnt get nogrowth results cultures
none look
poorest growth occurs pure oxygen
incubated infrared light
andromeda grows best carbon dioxide hydrogen
incubated x rays
excretions
waste kind
youd expect
andromedas perfect existence outer space
consumes everything wastes nothing
good lord stone delta five
put robertson immediately

god hope late
tell
functions like atomic reactor
atomic blast could provide
enough energy grow
gigantic supercolony
one day
relax
weve left president
agreed drop bomb
youve got stop carried
wait minute
playing pingpong
got telling president
gods sake go back
grows exposed x rays source energy
tell nuclear device
must detonated anywhere near
found andromeda works
like little reactor
converts matter energy
energy matter directly
bomb would provide
fantastically rich growth medium
understand
ill pass along recommendation
boss pleased know
made right decision
first place
congratulate scientific insight
robbie
youd better get atomic selfdestruct
disarmed soon possible
right ill start clearances
itll done morning

wont work damn things going
molecules appear
yes
andromeda isnt composed different substances
like normal cell
subunits
damndest thing ive ever
boy single substance
hell operate
anything simple
utilize energy growth
way telling structure
yes
new data
get computerized version
andromeda functions
theyre uniform
could mutations
devil

computers overloaded
much data coming fast
dividing mutating time
nothing stop
normal earth checks balances dont exist
wed better get biomath mapping
new growth potential spread
according therell supercolony
andromeda entire southwest
jeremy biological warfare maps
yes
oh simulations charlie
defensive scenario
thats point
gods sake
wildfire built germ warfare
wildfire scoop
knew stone
knew
thats true ruth
learned scoop time
already andromeda programmed
purpose scoop find
new biological weapons outer space
use wildfire develop
stinks
youre blowing tops
proof
map
dont ass
map shows andromeda
could hands enemy
enemy
perhaps hardly time
organize protest
another giant leap mankind
wish could believe
whether
important thing
find antidote
lets get charlie
test cultured organisms
biologic potency
right ill run
rat autopsy
want seal capsule
watch
andromedas altered
effect might radically different
ill try get us photo mutated form
photo lab red map
offbeat access reference reads f
please copy
may key beating andromeda
starving death
dont feed tell
contamination
seal broken autopsy
emergency procedures effect
whats matter
infection spread autopsy
alive
shouldve dr dutton
use sealed
dr hall
shes trouble
ruth
shes got germ
someone bring milligrams
phenobarb syringe fast
theres danger
isnt contagious
theres danger
l p e e e
second quarter rest period canceled
time ra reassigned
according crash program
come
come cant hurt
wasnt dr dutton
epilepsy
give injection
shell right
good girl thanks
im scared
oh lord im scared
youll okay charlie
pumping pure oxygen lab
know andromeda doesnt well oxygen
hes alive

leavitt seizure

epilepsy red light
flashing per second
brought fit
hell didnt tell us
top lab would knew
insurance prejudice crap
middle ages
amazing hes still alive
well three minutes
hes pure oxygen
dont know long hold
working ideas charlie
ask germ warfare friends
lots
try stay calm
happened
seal mustve broken
thing lunar lab
thats use polycron gaskets
least rest wildfire secure
poor devil
look way hes breathing
hes scared death
oxygen relax
slow breathing
want breathe fast
piedmont jackson crocked sterno
sterno acidosis
acidosis rapid breathing
hell
turn oxygen put room air
baby hes normal
cries time
cant catch breath
rapid breathing
cant simple
isnt
dutton think rapid breathing helps
dont let bug lungs long enough
penetrate blood vessels
want turn pure oxygen
start breathing room air fast

running test
air thick andromeda
experiment life damn
wont charlie
take easy
know im close
im sure something
blood chemistry breathing
dr hall may please feed baby
hes crying steadily
thats want keep crying
run another blood value
get ph measurements
yes doctor
yelling
blowing carbon dioxide
kid little acid
alkaline blood condition
opposite old man
much alkali
well good dutton
karen wheres blood test
coming console
hell way run hospital
expected
opposite blood chemistries
baby old man
one dead opposite
hes
must connection
stayed alive piedmont
breathing air
ones blood alkaline
acid
yes yes
dutton im turning oxygen
breathe fast hard
jeremy
dont let cut oxygen
air room loaded
air doesnt matter
blood thats answer
need seconds run growth program
could die seconds
besides leavitt checked growth programs
might missed something
epileptics blank
want see growth andromeda
affected blood chemistry ph
oh damn

excellent
graphs practically straight
means andromeda exist
within narrow range ph
narrow range
either side tolerance range growth
nothing right
exterminated
dutton troubles
look console
grows within narrow range ph
narrow range
bloods abnormal acid alkaline
andromeda cant survive body
breathe fast
go respiratory alkalosis
yes fine
thatll shoot blood chemistry hell
happens baby
cries much
old man sterno
feel
okay
little dizzy okay
cant keep breathing like forever
hell hyperventilate pass
weve got get something alkalize blood
cant
charlie
cage hot room
right front
alive
rats exposed long
longer exposed cultures
seal broke
precisely
andromedas mutated noninfectious form
holy
gasket lead
central core
connects labs
gaskets decomposing
andromeda
next sector
theres substation sector
level sealed
emergency procedures effect
bomb goes
therell thousand mutations
andromeda spread everywhere
theyll never rid
five minutes selfdestruct
levels
cant tell sector seals
contaminated
even elevator
defense system perfect
itll even bury mistakes
central core
cores equipped safeguards
like
gas lasers
prevent escape lab animals
would chances
dont exist anyone anywhere stay
get core
service port
go ahead
ill ride shotgun main control
cant monitor lasers
karen get scalpel
four minutes
seconds selfdestruct
cut
cut panel
karen cut
come hurry
hey doc aint leaving us
lasers tuned low small animals mark
make youre hit along spinal cord
four minutes selfdestruct
thats ladder across
go gas starts
three minutes seconds selfdestruct
thats gas keep going
sensors picked
get moving
duck
keep going
duck
keep going
duck
three minutes selfdestruct
good
levels contaminated
youll go
go
two minutes seconds selfdestruct
sway weave
youre zeroed duck
two minutes
seconds selfdestruct
keep going youll make
two minutes seconds selfdestruct
fight effect mostly shock
youve lost time still
see door
two minutes selfdestruct
one minute seconds selfdestruct
one minute seconds selfdestruct

youre airlock
turn wheel
one minute seconds selfdestruct
one
one near door
seconds selfdestruct
seconds selfdestruct
seconds selfdestruct

seconds selfdestruct
come
help
seconds selfdestruct
seconds selfdestruct
seconds selfdestruct
seconds selfdestruct
twenty seconds




selfdestruct canceled
congratulations
take bomb didnt
didnt
eight seconds spare
hardly even exciting
whats happening
super colonys coast
moving southwest across pacific
apparently andromeda hasnt turned lethal
least havent
reports bizarre deaths
applying adaptation
antidote
cloud seeding
seeding clouds andromeda
silver iodide
raindrops carry
organism ocean
alkaline reaction
seawater kill
acids alkali
blood stopped
cloud seeding business
absolutely sure worked
better
reports indicate
experiment successful
feel confident
socalled biological crisis
far andromedas concerned yes
organism wildfire
continue study
know beyond doubt
forms life
exist universe
thanks scoop
yes
however new knowledge
theres guarantee
another socalled biological crisis
wont occur
hmm

precisely senator
