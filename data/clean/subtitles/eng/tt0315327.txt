making buffalo s largest cookie 
  you have to wear this 
  a hairnet 
health department  if you re around
the cookie  you have to have it on 
i just did the hair 
the hairis perfect 
all right  give it to me 
god    why do you hate me 
we re rolling  and speed 
for three decades 
the kowolski bakery
has been a mainstay
in downtown buffalo 
known for their sinfully sweet 
cream filled polski pierogies
and the occasional
sugar induced coma that follows 
today  in honour of their 30th anniversary 
they ve invited us to ride along
as they go for the record
on buffalo s biggest cookie 
vol  do you need
a tissue or something 
can we get vol a tissue  or a spoon 
good thing we re wearing these 
i wouldn t want any stray hairs
to fall into the booger 
  we doing this again 
  no  we can cut to b roll 
moving on 
tell me  mama 
why make buffalo s biggest cookie 
well  man from health department
say he find rat pellet in our pastry 
but i say no  is big chocolate sprinkle 
but he shut store down 
so we clean up 
make big cookie
for to bring customers back 
well  i admire your candour 
let s try that again  shall we 
tell me  mama 
why make buffalo s biggest cookie 
so the children of the neighbourhood
will be happy 
it must be wonderful seeing
the smiles on their little faces 
i work in back  i see no smiles 
the previous record was 8 feet
7 inches  baked by gladys pelsnick 
if this cookie beats that  it will prove
the kowolskis
have much more free time 
and the cookie is    10 feet  4 inches 
we have a new record 
cue the cheesy inspirational music 
but what are we really looking at here 
is it just a big cookie 
or does this cookie represent
the pride of buffalo 
its hard working citizens
the key ingredient  
with a few nuts thrown in 
and finally 
the love of our families 
which provides the warm centre 
making our beloved buffalo
the sweetest place to live 
and that s the way
the cookie crumbles 
i m bruce nolan  eyewitness news 
and cut 
so what do you think 
it s really good 
it sucks  it s a story about a cookie 
the pillsbury doughboy
would be riveted 
it made me laugh  nothing wrong
with making people laugh 
i ll never be an anchorman 
the job s there  but i can t reach it 
every time they make me do
this kind of stuff i have to act like a goof

you know what 
nothing can bother me today  nothing 
now remember

without incident  susan 
bruce nolan is at niagara falls 
but before we go live to bruce 
we have an announcement 
as everyone knows  after 33 years 
our beloved pete fineman is retiring 
pete s shoes are virtually impossible
to fill  but the show must go on 
and we could think ofno one better
than our very own evan baxter 
oh  boy 
  congratulations 
  i m thrilled and honoured 
as you said  no one can replace
pete  but i will do my best 
i am so proud to be a part
of our local community of buffalo 
i think  in a lot of ways  a great
city is like a great recipe  really 
you take hard working citizens 
add some care givers 
maybe a few nuts 
all sprinkled with the love
and support of our good families 
ultimately  that makes
one sweet place to live 
  that was amazing 
  i wish i d written something 
and now let s go live to that wacky
bruce nolan at niagara falls 
hey  wacky bruce

someone with real talent can do
when great opportunities

with katharine hepburn s mom 
why did you throw the heart of the ocean
jewel over the railing of the titanic 
did you feel bad
letting leo dicaprio drown
while you were safe
floating on the door 
could you have taken turns 
or were you too afraid
to freeze your big fat ass off 
i guess that s how life is 
some people are drenched  freezing
on a stupid boat with a stupid hat 
while others are in a news studio 
sucking up the glory 
oh  well  no big deal

if you hadn t used
the cheesy file cabinet illusion 
anybody with a brain stem
can tell that drawer
is being fed through the wall
from the other side 
all you have to do
is find the crease right around here 
there is a seam here  or a hollow spot 
where 
through the dry wall and concrete 
ok  that is a good one 
  how many fingers am i holding up 
  thou shalt not tempt the lord

the body of jimmy hoffa
was uncovered in a field today
outside a canine training centre
in buffalo  new york 
  bruce nolan was first on the scene 
  thank you  jane 
as you can see 
the body is being carefully exhumed
for transportation to a facility
where dna can confirm the identity 
that  however 
merely a formality at this point 
as the body was found with a birth
certificate and dental records 
i d call that a red letter day
for any canine unit 
but was that enough for hank 
no  siree 
moments later  he busted
a local news camera crew
with 220 pounds of marijuana 
i never saw it before  i swear 
i m bruce nolan   
and that s the way
the cookie crumbles 
did you like that 
thank you  thank you

  hoffa  what are the odds of that 
  what are the odds of that 
  bruce  why don t you sit down 
  ok 
i m going to be straight with you 
we want you back  bruce 
but i want you to understand
it was not my decision to let you go 
  when the big guy gives the order   
  no harm  no foul 
i needed to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self 
  you did that in a day 
  imagine what i could do with seven 
it is not in my power
to give you anchor 
as far as field reporting goes 
if you re looking for a bump   
let s cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks 
i had you going 
don t worry about it 
my old friend 
just give me a camera 
i ll give you the news 
my secret is that i let the jalapenos
marinate in a spicy sauce
for at least 24 hours
before i stir it into the chilli 
then i let it all come to a simmer 
hold that thought  it seems as if
an asteroid or meteorite
has just hit ground right outside
the mark twain chilli cook off 
this should certainly
spice things up a bit 
his stories are all over town 
from unearthing hoffa
   to a meteor crashing 
   bruce nolan is rapidly
becoming known as   
and that s the way
the cookie crumbles 
this was bruce s idea 
he wanted me to have a day of beauty
and luxurious serenity 
i got to tell you 
he is impressing me lately 
know where he s taking me to dinner 
where 
the blue palm 
  my gosh  i got chills 
  i know 
he told me to prepare for the most
memorable night of our lives 
oh  my gosh  he s going to propose 
oh  stop it  no  he s   
  really 
  yeah  really 
do the math 
he sends you all day to a beauty spa 
he s taking you to a restaurant
where you had your first date  hello 
i never thought i d say this 
but bruce is right 
this is your night 
relax and enjoy it
