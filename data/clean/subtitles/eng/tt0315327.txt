the kowolski bakery
has been a mainstay
in downtown buffalo
known for their sinfully sweet
creamfilled polski pierogies
and the occasional
sugarinduced coma that follows
today in honour of their 30th anniversary
theyve invited us to ride along
as they go for the record
on buffalos biggest cookie

the previous record was 8 feet
7 inches baked by gladys pelsnick
if this cookie beats that it will prove
the kowolskis
have much more free time
and the cookie is 10 feet 4 inches
we have a new record
cue the cheesy inspirational music
but what are we really looking at here
is it just a big cookie
or does this cookie represent
the pride of buffalo
its hardworking citizens
the key ingredient
with a few nuts thrown in
and finally
the love of our families
which provides the warm centre
making our beloved buffalo
the sweetest place to live
and thats the way
the cookie crumbles

than our very own evan baxter
oh boy
congratulations
im thrilled and honoured
as you said no one can replace
pete but i will do my best
i am so proud to be a part
of our local community of buffalo
i think in a lot of ways a great
city is like a great recipe really
you take hardworking citizens
add some caregivers
maybe a few nuts
all sprinkled with the love
and support of our good families
ultimately that makes
one sweet place to live
that was amazing

why did you throw the heart of the ocean
jewel over the railing of the titanic
did you feel bad
letting leo dicaprio drown
while you were safe
floating on the door

phil sidleman at the police canine
training centre channel 5 news

look what the cat coughed up
channel 7 right

what are you doing here
looking for a story
no story here
this pond is all fished out
pretty standard stuff anyway
my instinct tells me
theres something more
well go with that
it served you well in the past right
hank found something
we got a body
shit get the camera now
its locked the keys are inside
i guess every dog has his day
kid you want to make 10
sure
know how to use one of these
duh
seems to be in tune lets do this
the body of jimmy hoffa
was uncovered in a field today
outside a canine training centre
in buffalo new york
bruce nolan was first on the scene
thank you jane
as you can see
the body is being carefully exhumed
for transportation to a facility
where dna can confirm the identity
that however
merely a formality at this point
as the body was found with a birth
certificate and dental records
id call that a redletter day
for any canine unit
but was that enough for hank
no siree
moments later he busted
a local news camera crew
with 220 pounds of marijuana
i never saw it before i swear
im bruce nolan
and thats the way
the cookie crumbles
did you like that
thank you thank you
hi bruce
hi susan

hoffa what are the odds of that
what are the odds of that
bruce why dont you sit down
ok
im going to be straight with you
we want you back bruce
but i want you to understand
it was not my decision to let you go
when the big guy gives the order
no harm no foul
i needed to reassess my goals
and get in touch with my true self
you did that in a day
imagine what i could do with seven
it is not in my power
to give you anchor
as far as field reporting goes
if youre looking for a bump
lets cut the crap
and get down to brass tacks

just give me a camera
ill give you the news
my secret is that i let the jalapenos
marinate in a spicy sauce
for at least 24 hours
before i stir it into the chilli
then i let it all come to a simmer
hold that thought it seems as if
an asteroid or meteorite
has just hit ground right outside
the mark twain chilli cookoff
this should certainly
spice things up a bit
his stories are all over town
from unearthing hoffa
to a meteor crashing
bruce nolan is rapidly
becoming known as

the cookie crumbles
