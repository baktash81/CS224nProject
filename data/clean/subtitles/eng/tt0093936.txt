miracle never happened

you are one of those 90
tough break
nbsp
mr forbush i was counting on this job
what do i do now
nbsp
punt
nbsp
okay new york
nbsp
if this is the way
you want it okay
nbsp
im sorry mister
foster
nbsp
im sorry mr foster
we need someone with experience
nbsp
how can i get experience until i get
a job that gives me experience
nbsp
if we gave you a job
just to give you experience
nbsp
youd take that experience
and get a better job
nbsp
then that experience
would benefit someone else
nbsp
but i was trained in college
to handle a job like this
nbsp
so in a sense
i already have experience
nbsp
what youve got is
college experience
nbsp
not the practical hardnosed business
experience were looking for
nbsp
if youd joined our training program out
of high school youd be qualified now
nbsp
then whyd i go to college
had fun didnt you
nbsp
what impresses me most
nbsp
is the amount of experience you picked
up while still attending college
nbsp
well maam i knew all
those years of college
nbsp
would be worthless without practical
hardnosed business experience
nbsp
assistant personnel manager
j hall communications
nbsp

then the new dog chewed up this
entire report that id been working on
nbsp
are you suggesting
that your dog ate your homework
nbsp
in a way yes sir

tucker whatre you gonna do about it
sighs
nbsp
all right look
what does a boxcar cost

the transfer sheet
shows that somebody
nbsp
is accumulating
an enormous block of our stock
nbsp
what do you think about that thomas
i think its very encouraging
nbsp
oh you do do you
y es sir
nbsp
when a stock takes a dive
and somebody buys a ton of it
nbsp
it means that stock is on
its way to a quick rebound
nbsp
it means that the company
is ripe for a hostile takeover
nbsp
thats what i meant
a hostile takeover sir
nbsp
y es im afraid thats
what were looking at
nbsp
i want each of you to examine
your department and see
where you can cut costs
nbsp
cut cut them
to the core
nbsp
we need to raise capital quickly
so we can boost stock support
nbsp
boost it
boost it to the moon
nbsp
you gonna put that
in writin
nbsp

that we have to service our customers

on those figures from ron
nbsp
christy wills how do you do
good
nbsp
terrible news

nbsp
conference room everybody

nbsp
all murmuring
nbsp
you dont eat lunch do you eat dinner
occasionally
nbsp
tonight
booked
nbsp
tomorrow night
booked
nbsp
all right but dont beg okay
its embarrassing
nbsp
executives murmuring
nbsp
do you know
what this is about
nbsp
who are you
nbsp
carlton whitfield
new employee
nbsp
i didnt get a memo
on that
nbsp
oh you will
nbsp
all right
as long as i get the memo
nbsp
the absolute worst has happened
we are the target of a corporate raid
nbsp
donald davenport has filed a 13d
gasping
nbsp
a 13d
executives murmuring
nbsp
hes acquired five percent
of the stock
nbsp
and this is definitely the beginning of
a hostile takeover of our corporation
nbsp
i think we all know what happened the
last time davenport took over a company
nbsp
everyone was canned
nbsp
mr prescott has sent down word
of what he wants us to do
nbsp
we are to recommend cuts
in every department
nbsp
our job is to slash
the red ink
nbsp
in every nook and cranny
nbsp
because our company needs
the cash for its defense
nbsp
anybody wanna fire
the first shot
nbsp
christy
kill toledo
nbsp
thats a good idea
nbsp
if we close down
our distribution centers
nbsp
in toledo joplin
jacksonville
nbsp
well slash the red ink
completely off the books
nbsp
executives applauding
murmuring in agreement
nbsp
whitfield you dont have to
raise your hand just speak
nbsp
thank you well
nbsp
i know im new here
and everything
nbsp
on the surface these cuts
seem like a good idea
seem like a good idea
nbsp
but closing down those distribution
centers would be a big mistake
nbsp
it so happens that those closings
are exactly what mr prescott wants
nbsp
well then mr prescott hasnt
thought things through very well
nbsp
all gasping
im going to tell him you said that
nbsp
good closing down
those centers
nbsp
will put a strain on
this companys cash position
nbsp
in the long run those cuts are going
to hurt this companys innate value
nbsp
innate value
what is he talking about
nbsp
davidson here will back me up
on this davidson
nbsp
im proctor hes davidson
nbsp
well damn it
davidson tell him
nbsp
you wrote a memo to mr thomas
explaining what im talking about
nbsp
well how do you know
i wrote that memo
nbsp
how did i know
you wrote that memo
nbsp
who else could write
that memo davidson
nbsp
that memo was famous
nbsp
that memo
was a masterpiece
nbsp
clear concise to the point
that was the best damn memo i ever read
nbsp
in fact that memo wasnt even a memo
that memo was literature
nbsp
well thank you
youre welcome
nbsp
if you have finished your book report
could you explain what your point is
nbsp
the point is we gotta be bold
thats my point
nbsp
we gotta build we gotta expand
davidson  absolutely
nbsp
expanding is the only way
to help the situation
nbsp
we gotta make
this company so strong
nbsp
davenport wont be able to find anyone
willing to give up pemrose stock
nbsp
itll be too damn valuable
then well buy his ass out
nbsp
absolutely
executives laughing agreeing
nbsp
how old are you mister uh mister
whitfield
nbsp
yes
twentyfour
nbsp
i think you should keep quiet
until youre at least 25
nbsp
if i may i dont think whitfields age
should be an issue here
nbsp
no one is interested
in your opinion davis
nbsp
we gotta block
that takeover
nbsp
im too old to look for a job
nobody would hire me
nbsp
executives arguing
nbsp
this meeting is going nowhere
arguing stops
nbsp
mr prescotts
command stands
nbsp
we are to find those cuts
nbsp
meeting adjourned
nbsp
executives chattering
nbsp
