  i m sorry  mister  
  foster 
 nbsp
i m sorry  mr  foster 
we need someone with experience 
 nbsp
how can i get experience until i get
a job that gives me experience 
 nbsp
if we gave you a job
just to give you experience 
 nbsp
you d take that experience
and get a better job 
 nbsp
then that experience
would benefit someone else 
 nbsp
but i was trained in college
to handle a job like this 
 nbsp
so in a sense 
i already have experience 
 nbsp
what you ve got is
college experience 
 nbsp
not the practical  hard nosed business
experience we re looking for 
 nbsp
if you d joined our training program out
of high school  you d be qualified now 
 nbsp
  then why d i go to college 
  had fun  didn t you 
 nbsp
what impresses me most   
 nbsp
is the amount of experience you picked
up while still attending college 
 nbsp
well  ma am  i knew all
those years of college   
 nbsp
would be worthless without practical 
hard nosed business experience 
 nbsp
 assistant personnel manager 
j  hall communications 
 nbsp
 junior purchasing agent 
midland furniture 
 nbsp
vice president in charge of
production  central manufacturing

 nbsp
  what kind of thinking is that 
  that s suit thinking 
 nbsp
something happens to a man
when he puts on a necktie

to his brain 
 nbsp
you crazy  you re not supposed to
take the memos out of the mail room

of command in this company 
 nbsp
they got the right title  but their job
assignments and objectives are screwed  
 nbsp
  look at this  jesus  purchasing

what s the problem 
 nbsp
our stock is down
another quarter point this morning 
 nbsp
whose fault is that 
thomas 
 nbsp
nobody s fault  sir 
it s a momentary lapse in the market 
 nbsp
  whose fault is it  thomas 
  uh  it s davis s fault  sir 
 nbsp
his department hasn t been
pulling its weight 
 nbsp
  what do you have to say for yourself 
  i ve been having troubles at home 
 nbsp
my wife ran over
the children s dog with her car 
 nbsp
then we had to buy
a new dog 
 nbsp
then the new dog chewed up this
entire report that i d been working on 
 nbsp
are you suggesting
that your dog ate your homework 
 nbsp
  in a way  yes  sir 
  this is not grade school  davis 
 nbsp
  run at the back of the line 
consider yourself on warning 
  uh  yes  sir

  i think it s very encouraging 
 nbsp
  oh  you do  do you 
  y es  sir 
 nbsp
when a stock takes a dive
and somebody buys a ton of it  
 nbsp
it means that stock is on
its way to a quick rebound 
 nbsp
it means that the company
is ripe for a hostile takeover 
 nbsp
  that s what i meant 
  a hostile takeover  sir 
 nbsp
y es  i m afraid that s
what we re looking at 
 nbsp
i want each of you to examine
your department and see
where you can cut costs

 nbsp
  christy wills  how do you do 
  good 
 nbsp

just awful 
 nbsp
conference room  everybody 
come on  on the double 
 nbsp
  all murmuring  
 nbsp
 you don t eat lunch  do you eat dinner 
 occasionally 
 nbsp
  tonight 
  booked 
 nbsp
  tomorrow night 
  booked 
 nbsp
all right  but don t beg  okay 
it s embarrassing 
 nbsp
  executives murmuring  
 nbsp
do you know
what this is about 
 nbsp
who are you 
 nbsp
carlton whitfield 
new employee 
 nbsp
i didn t get a memo
on that 
 nbsp
oh  you will 
 nbsp
all right 
as long as i get the memo 
 nbsp
the absolute worst has happened 
we are the target of a corporate raid 
 nbsp
  donald davenport has filed a 13 d 
    gasping  
 nbsp
  a 13 d 
    executives murmuring  
 nbsp
he s acquired five percent
of the stock 
 nbsp
and this is definitely the beginning of
a hostile takeover of our corporation 
 nbsp
i think we all know what happened the
last time davenport took over a company 
 nbsp
everyone was canned 
 nbsp
mr  prescott has sent down word
of what he wants us to do 
 nbsp
we are to recommend cuts
in every department 
 nbsp
our job is to slash
the red ink   
 nbsp
in every nook and cranny 
 nbsp
because our company needs
the cash for its defense 
 nbsp
anybody wanna fire
the first shot 
 nbsp
  christy  
kill toledo 
 nbsp
that s a good idea 
 nbsp
if we close down
our distribution centers   
 nbsp
in toledo  joplin 
jacksonville 
 nbsp
we ll slash the red ink
completely off the books 
 nbsp
  executives applauding 
murmuring in agreement  
 nbsp
whitfield  you don t have to
raise your hand  just speak 
 nbsp
thank you  well   
 nbsp
i know i m new here
and everything 
 nbsp
  on the surface  these cuts
seem like a good idea  
   seem like a good idea  
 nbsp
but closing down those distribution
centers would be a big mistake 
 nbsp
it so happens that those closings
are exactly what mr  prescott wants 
 nbsp
well  then mr  prescott hasn t
thought things through very well 
 nbsp
    all gasping  
  i m going to tell him you said that 
 nbsp
good  closing down
those centers   
 nbsp
will put a strain on
this company s cash position 
 nbsp
in the long run  those cuts are going
to hurt this company s innate value 
 nbsp
innate value 
what is he talking about 
 nbsp
davidson here will back me up
on this  davidson 
 nbsp
i m proctor  he s davidson 
 nbsp
well  damn it 
davidson  tell him 
 nbsp
you wrote a memo to mr  thomas
explaining what i m talking about 
 nbsp
well  how do you know
i wrote that memo 
 nbsp
how did i know
you wrote that memo 
 nbsp
who else could write
that memo  davidson 
 nbsp
that memo was famous 
 nbsp
that memo
was a masterpiece 
 nbsp
clear  concise  to the point 
that was the best damn memo i ever read 
 nbsp
in fact  that memo wasn t even a memo 
that memo was literature 
 nbsp
  well  thank you 
  you re welcome 
 nbsp
if you have finished your book report 
could you explain what your point is 
 nbsp
  the point is  we gotta be bold 
  that s my point 
 nbsp
  we gotta build  we gotta expand 
    davidson   absolutely 
 nbsp
expanding is the only way
to help the situation 
 nbsp
we gotta make
this company so strong 
 nbsp
davenport won t be able to find anyone
willing to give up pemrose stock 
 nbsp
it ll be too damn valuable 
then we ll buy his ass out 
 nbsp
  absolutely 
    executives laughing  agreeing  
 nbsp
  how old are you  mister  uh  mister  
  whitfield 
 nbsp
  yes 
  twenty four 
 nbsp
i think you should keep quiet
until you re at least 25 
 nbsp
if i may  i don t think whitfield s age
should be an issue here 
 nbsp
no one is interested
in your opinion  davis 
 nbsp
we gotta block
that takeover 
 nbsp
i m too old to look for a job 
nobody would hire me 
 nbsp
  executives arguing  
 nbsp
  this meeting is going nowhere 
    arguing stops  
 nbsp
mr  prescott s
command stands 
 nbsp
we are to find those cuts 
 nbsp
meeting adjourned 
 nbsp
  executives chattering  
 nbsp

that looks like one only a lot smaller 
 nbsp
