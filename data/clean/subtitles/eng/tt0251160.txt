there are procedures we need to go over
what kind of procedures
were admitting your son
you need to fill out the proper forms
what kind of forms
your son may need a transfusion
well need to test you both for blood type
were coming right back baby
wait a minute
first name mr archibald
john
middle initial
q quincy
name of your insurance company
where is he is he okay
we dont know theyre running tests
were waiting to find the results
is there anything we can do
your card mr archibald

its okay you can go in now
sweetheart
how you doing slugger
i cant talk
dont worry about it get your rest
were going to be out of here in a while
we love you son
i love you too
what is all this
this this is so we can
monitor mikes vitals
respiratory rate
pulse oximetry heart rate
and this one is blood pressure
diastolic and systolic
wed like this top number
to stay above 90
if his blood pressure drops
were going to have to do something
we cant have him going
below 70 again
why what would that mean
if he went below 70 again
70 and below hes in heart failure
if you need anything
thank you
hows the company insurance
he works part time
she works as a grocery store clerk
can we do anything
i got to go
mr and mrs archibald
im rebecca payne hospital director
hi there
its nice to meet you
this is dr turner head of cardiology
and michaels doctor
how do you do
good my wife
hows our boy doing
please sit down
this xray shows
a normal nineyearolds heart
this xray is that of your son michael
there are septal defects
here here and here
which have induced myopathy
resulting pulmonary edema
and malignant ventricular ectopy
michaels heart is approximately
three times larger than normal size
im sorry
i didnt understand what you said
could you put that in layman terms
basically theres not enough blood
being pumped by michaels heart
so it backs up in the lungs
like a sponge getting wet
his heart is trying
but its working too hard
what does he need
an operation or
were considerably beyond
corrective surgery mr and mrs archibald
mikes heart is useless
hes going to need a transplant
or hes going to die
wait a second
there are other options
what options
to do nothing
medicate him make him feel
as comfortable as possible
youre going to have to start thinking
about quality of life now
i dont understand
we were just with him
and he seemed fine
hes going to seem fine
but as his heart gets worse
he will become increasingly fatigued
and he will sleep more and more
until one day he will fall asleep
and he wont wake up
i know this is difficult
but you have to face the fact
that your son
may not live much longer
you might want to make it
a happy time say goodbye
god
transplantation is a highrisk operation
you could lose your son on that table
you might not want
to take that chance
if he doesnt have the surgery
if he doesnt have the surgery
how long would he live
not long months weeks
days
come on all right
come on now
im sorry
this is a lot
all right
if he was your son
what would you do
id do the transplant absolutely
okay okay
lets do that lets do it
first weve got to get mikes name
on the organ recipient list
hes bpositive so his name
should go right to the top
its not so simple
there are other considerations before
a recipient can be placed on a donor list
transplant surgery is very expensive
in most cases prohibitively so
we got insurance major medical
hes covered
weve already checked
with your carrier mr archibald
there are no provisions in your policy
for a procedure of this magnitude
thats a mistake
not that youre making a mistake
im just saying that im insured
my sons covered
mrs archibald
do you have coverage
no ive only been working
at the supermarket a couple months
you dont get benefits until
doesnt matter we got insurance
i can see here
that you dont own your home
you have no stocks
no bonds no investments
you have a little over 1000 in savings
but we got insurance
that may very well be youre going to
have to check with your carrier
in the meantime were going to
have to treat this as a cash account
what
how much does a transplant cost
wait a minute
how much does it cost
transplant surgery
doctors fees postoperative care
immunosuppressant drugs
youre looking at a minimum of 250000
if you opt for transplant surgery
that is your choice
but the hospital maintains a very
strict policy with regard to cash patients
we require down payment before we put
a patients name on a receivers list
how much
what kind of down payment
30 75000
to put my sons name on a list
our son is upstairs dying
all you can do is talk about money
it costs money to provide health care
its expensive for you
its expensive for us
youre going to
have to guarantee payment
before i can put
your sons name on the list
mr and mrs archibald
please wait
if you people dont want to treat our son
well take him over to county memorial
you dont want to do that
they have to treat him
heart transplantation is
always considered an elective procedure
youre in the right place
what are we supposed to do
talk to your insurance company again
check with our human resources
department for medical assistance
theres money theres childrens
state services and medicaid
you find a way to keep him here
you just dont take no for an answer
your policy has changed
mr archibald
changed to what
weve recently switched carriers
from a ppo to an hmo
its a less expensive policy
unfortunately there are some restrictions
what kind of restrictions
heres how it works
nonmanagement
parttime employees such as yourself
only qualify for secondtier
catastrophic coverage
im not part time im full time
its just slow right now
sure but your coverage
is based on hours worked
like i said
you only qualify for second tier
that has a maximum
payout limit of 20000
what
you have been taking money
out of my cheque every week
ive been paying into
this policy for years
thats why were going to cover you
for the full 20000
youre kidding me right
come on
you have dropped me from full time
to part time you switched carriers
now youre telling me im not fully covered
even though i got a policy that says i am
it doesnt seem right does it
no it doesnt my son is very sick
if im not covered
i got a serious problem
i understand that
but theres nothing i can do
you can file an appeal
yeah
here you go that takes
about seven working days
says here you already have
medical insurance
not enough
what little we have is already used up
you on welfare
you should be on welfare
we both have jobs
thats too bad
im sorry i cant help you
try county medical
yes maam i need to speak
to somebody in financial aid
no i dont want to hold
ive been holding for 15 minutes
we dont have enough money
should i get another job
im not yelling
youre yelling in here
next please
wrong line window 15
what
window 15
no
no what
no you dont qualify
my son is dying im broke
if i dont qualify who the hell does
im sorry
i dont need you to be sorry
i need you to help me
no this is an appeal
an appeal is for an already existing claim
you needed to file a grievance
you filed the wrong paperwork
wait a minute
youre going to have to resubmit
it could take 30 days
i dont have 30 days
i know
im getting sick of the runaround
i need my sons name on that list
your account is in excess of 30000
the hospital has bent over backwards
to help you out
is that right
yes it is right
but there is a limit to our generosity
once and for all
your insurance does not cover this
take it
watch your step
this thing is frigging heavy
get out of the way
friends one among us
is suffering in great pain today
this is a good man
you cant say
that youre not going to pitch
bernie frowned
puzzled by babes answer okay babe

god of mercy into his hands

good how are you
how are you fellows
is it true the man inside
wants an operation for his son
everything good
good to see you
do you know what weapon he has
youll talk to me right
ill let you know when i know okay
youll be the first
ill let you know later
gus how are you
how you doing frank its hot
yeah it is
a little early for heavy artillery isnt it
maybe maybe not
you should tell me whats going on
youre looking at it
a very upset father inside well give him
a couple of minutes to cool off
lets not give him too much time
lets end this quick and quiet
thats the plan
all right good
in that case im just here
to lend my support in any way that i can
i dont need a babysitter on this
its under control
is it
yes
all right cant have people
running around the street using guns
makes it look like the citys unsafe
besides i got to be here
chief doesnt show up
looks like hes asleep at the wheel
just stay out of my way
the tv cameras are over there
they should make you feel
right at home
right why dont you just relax
why cant you relax
im fine
why dont you just do your job
im doing my job
were both cops right
were on the same side remember
right
right
its good to see you thanks
yes mr mayor
ill see you in a little bit
no we got it i got it
how are you
the old man looking for his depends
he leave them over here
what i dont understand is why
they never found it the doctors
my son has had clean checkups
every year since the day he was born
how could the doctors not pick it up
he might not have been tested enough
why not
you got an hmo right
theres your answer
hmos pay their doctors not to test
its their way of keeping costs down
say mike did need additional testing
and insurance says they wont cover them
the doctor keeps his mouth shut
and come christmas
the hmo sends the doctor
a fatass bonus cheque
is that true
possible not likely but possible
these doctors may have known
what was wrong with my son
and they could have
treated him all along
who knows i dont know
dont take this personal doc
youre a bunch of crooks
you dont know what youre talking about
what about that thing you take
the thing
that promise
its called the hippocratic oath
more like the hypocritical oath
hows it go doc
i solemnly swear to take care
of the sick and damnneardying
unless they aint got major medical
something like that
youve got it perfectly
its funny but its not far from the truth
this shit happens all the time
paramedics bring in
some accident victim
when the boys in accounting find out
they cant pay they send them packing
hospitals cant turn people away
isnt there laws against that
theres also ways around those laws
we have to stabilise them
after that were off the hook
thats not how it works
thats exactly how it works
maybe not on the fifth floor
but in here if you dont have money
you get a bandaid a foot in the ass
and youre out the door
enough already ive heard all the bitching
and moaning i can stand for one day
if you all want to regard me as some kind
of bloodsucking vampire great
ill be the bad guy
but whos holding the fucking gun

several hostages
who will immediately be debriefed
by members of the crisis team
will the man known as john q
get a heant for his little boy
only time will tell
from hope memorial hospital
im tuck lampley
is it true an ambulance dropped off
a victim after the gunman took over
he unlocked the door
and he let him inside
can you comment
the man was critically injured
if he hadnt let him in
he would have died
maam are you all right
i feel good were having a baby
maam any comments
about the gunman
john q very good man
the gunman
very good man
they got a camera
theyre watching a video feed
how do you know
theyre looking at something
i want to know what can you get it
boss if they got it i can get it
you give in theres going to be guns
in every hospital in the country
you think mr archibalds
the only one who has a sick child
have you checked the hiv ward
theres a whole floor full
people get sick they die
thats the way it goes
im faced with
decisions like this every day
theres a man threatening innocent people
because you refused to help his son
there are 50 million people in this country
without medical insurance
if youd like to change it
call your congressman
excuse me why dont we just tell him
his sons names on the list
doesnt that make sense
hows he going to know anyway
sir pardon me
can you come take a look at this
sarge chief moroe
this is wally pitoniak head of security
nice to meet you
i got your spot
heres your sight
thats going to be your perch
the x there thats your phone
which phone
bring it up jeff
the phone right there
it is tom but chief moroe maintains
the police will do whatever is necessary
to preserve the lives
and safety of these hostages
thanks tuck
this country man
cant go anywhere anymore without
getting mugged or murdered or stabbed
kids killing their classmates
drivebys
i wont even go into a post office
shut up mitch
you shut up
i hate the little bastard but hes right
you know how easy it is to get a gun
five minutes gun show
i understand your kid is sick john
but what makes him better than me
i got a life too
but you got insurance
so what are you going to shoot me
thats what youre telling the cops
if your son doesnt get
the very first heart available we all die
hows it going to end john
whats your move
i got no moves okay
i dont know what im going to do
im waiting on a miracle okay
im waiting on an act of god
could we have a word
with you please
this is all my fault
when the hospital told me
they were releasing mikey
i called john and yelled at him
told him to do something anything
but i never thought
i understand
is he a violent man mrs archibald
no hes sweet and gentle
he wouldnt hurt a fly
thats not what hes saying
hes talking about killing people
i may be fishing but has he spent time
in the military or anything like that
what is this
what
i see whats going on here
youre trying to get me to say something
you can use against my husband
hes in a lot of trouble
were going to need you to talk to him
lets get something straight mister
you cannot use me
to build a case against my husband
i support him in everything he does
im on his side not yours
and you dont talk to me
i would tell you
what i think of you
but im a christian woman
now you two leave me alone
i have a sick child to look after
ive decided to put michaels name
on the recipient list
the hospital will pay for everything
really
really
thank you
oh god thank you
youre good
excuse me
quite the performance
what are you talking about
comforting embrace sincere look
for a minute
i actually believed you cared
we go now to hope memorial hospital
live tuck lampley
as you can see the crowd
in front of hope memorial is growing
the swat team has arrived
the situation is becoming tense
standing next to me is james palumbo
friend of john archibald
mr palumbo what can you tell us
about john archibald
you know i got to be honest tuck
this whole thing sucks
it all could have been avoided
so incredibly easy
none of this had to happen
if john had been a frigging millionaire
or if his last name was rockefeller
but sometimes john dont get it
he dont understand that what
we hold sacred in this country isnt values
its value thats important
we got haves we got havenots
weve got white collar
blue collar and no collar
inside there we got surgery
outpatient surgery outofluck surgery
theres a lot of people out there
who dont got 250 grand in their billfold
to shame a man like that
and back him into a corner
seems to me that something
is out of whack not someone
but what do i know
im a factory worker
i see this is making you upset
but if you could look into the camera
and speak to john q right now
what would you say to him
im there with you

sergeant
moody
police chief moroe
whats going on here john
hes got no pants on
you lied to me lieutenant
you said you were going to
call me back but you didnt
i gave you your hostages
but you didnt call me back why
because you want me dead
nobody wants to kill you
nobody wants to kill me
none of these guys not him
what is this
what did you think would happen
you want truth heres some truth
this is going to end up bad for you
theres only two ways out of here
jail or dead
my son is very sick
and he needs some help
its hard to be a man these days
hard to know what the right thing is
but put the gun down john
youre not hearing me frank
my son is sick thats it
theres nothing else end of story
when people are sick
they deserve a little help
sick help
i am not going to bury my son
my son is going to bury me
you think these people
give a shit about you they dont
youre just the cause of the moment
nobody cares thats the real truth
nobody cares only you
and its only you and me out here
and all these guns pointed at you
what do you want to do
its your call
i want my son
i want my son inside with me
cant do it john
you give me my boy
i give you your sniper
its all over
you bring my son
i give up
everybody goes home
everybodys safe
you bring me my son
come on
all right
what do you think frank
give it to him hes not going to
hurt anybody with his boy in there
the object is to get hostages out
not bring them in
its not a hostage
its his son
have all these people
been on the news
its your call frank
all right give it to him
hold it
no listen to me
im his mother
i need to be in there
stop stop right there
go beat it now
were in trouble mikes blood pressure
has dropped into the mid40s
his atrial blood pressure
should be in the low teens its 35
im sorry john
without a new heart
hes not going to make it
then take mine
what
you heard me
take my heart
and you put it in mike
you done lost your damn mind
you cant be serious
you bet im serious
im dead serious
oh my god
youll be dead
and my son will live
you cant do this
its the only way
physically you cant do this
i kill myself
you open me up take my heart
its perfect
thats just crazy
we cant just remove your heart
and put it into michaels body
there are too many unknowns
matching donor and recipient
is extremely complicated
critical tests have to be taken
like what
cross matches for blood type
chest cavity measurements
if blood tissues
are not completely compatible
i know about compatibility
weve been tested up the wazoo
were both bpositive
our tissues match
his hearts three times the size
of normal so mine will fit
you know were compatible
out of the question too risky
im telling you he will make it
cant do it
if im laying dead youre not going to
take my heart and save his life
youll let two die instead of one
because of a technicality
i think what john is trying to do is right
me too i think its so brave
what do you think mike would want
what about your wife
mikes too young to know
whats good for him
its my job to protect him
denise would do the same thing
i know whats happening to mike is bad
matter of fact its the worst
but killing yourself
aint going to solve a damn thing
sometimes you just
got to let go and let god
just accept it brother
accept it
accept what
that mike is going to die
no i dont accept that ever
i reject that out of hand
all right hes a patient to you
i understand but hes a good kid
he loves bodybuilding
he wants to be a bodybuilder
can you believe that
hes funny youd like him
youd like him if you got to know him
i do like him
then please im just begging you
step outside the rules
id like to john i really would
but what youre asking crosses the line
it is completely unethical
im crossing the line youre crossing
the whole system is crossing the line
maybe you dont understand
what im talking about
i dont give a damn
my sons going to live
maybe you havent figured that out by now
ill do whatever i got to do for him to live
what are you going to do
shoot me if i dont operate
im going to kill myself
all right
lets just see what happens
thats what this is about right
he needs a donor
somebodys got to die for him to live
im his father its me
all right
all right what
ill do it if thats what you want
youre going to let him kill himself
once hes dead why not
you are the finest surgeon
i have ever known
you cannot throw your career
your life away for this
if you do this youre finished
what are they going to do sue me
disbar me
evict me from the country club
this is still a hospital
if theres a heart available
im not going to let it go to waste
doctor mr maguire
lets get ready for surgery
theyre ready to harvest
all right hurry up guys

my will

you always listen to your mother
you understand
do what she tells you to do
shes your best friend
you tell her you love her every day
youre too young
for girls right now but
theres going to come a time
when it does
you treat them like princesses
cause thats what they are
when you say

when you say youre going to
do something you do it
because your word is your bond son
its all you have
and money you make money
if you get a chance
