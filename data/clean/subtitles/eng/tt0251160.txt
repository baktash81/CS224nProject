70 and below  he s in heart failure 
  if you need anything 
  thank you 
  how s the company insurance 
  he works part time 
  she works as a grocery store clerk 
  can we do anything 
i got to go 
mr and mrs archibald 
i m rebecca payne  hospital director 
hi there 
it s nice to meet you 
this is dr turner  head of cardiology
and michael s doctor 
  how do you do 
  good  my wife 
how s our boy doing 
please sit down 
this x ray shows
a normal nine year old s heart 
this x ray is that of your son michael 
there are septal defects
here  here  and here
which have induced myopathy 
resulting pulmonary edema 
and malignant ventricular ectopy 
michael s heart is approximately
three times larger than normal size 
i m sorry 
i didn t understand what you said 
could you put that in layman terms 
basically  there s not enough blood
being pumped by michael s heart 
so it backs up in the lungs
like a sponge getting wet 
his heart is trying 
but it s working too hard 
what  does he need
an operation  or   
we re considerably beyond
corrective surgery  mr and mrs archibald 
mike s heart is useless 
he s going to need a transplant
or he s going to die 
wait a second 
there are other options 
  what options 
  to do nothing 
medicate him  make him feel
as comfortable as possible 
you re going to have to start thinking
about quality of life now 
i don t understand 
we were just with him
and he seemed fine 
he s going to seem fine 
but as his heart gets worse 
he will become increasingly fatigued 
and he will sleep more and more 
until one day he will fall asleep 
and he won t wake up 
i know this is difficult 
but you have to face the fact
that your son
may not live much longer 
you might want to make it
a happy time  say good bye 
god 
transplantation is a high risk operation 
you could lose your son on that table 
you might not want
to take that chance 
if he doesn t have the surgery   
if he doesn t have the surgery 
how long would he live 
not long  months  weeks 
days 
come on  all right 
come on  now 
i m sorry 
this is a lot 
all right 
if he was your son 
what would you do 
  i d do the transplant  absolutely 
  okay  okay 
let s do that  let s do it 
first we ve got to get mike s name
on the organ recipient list 
he s b positive  so his name
should go right to the top 
it s not so simple 
there are other considerations before
a recipient can be placed on a donor list 
transplant surgery is very expensive 
in most cases  prohibitively so 
we got insurance  major medical 
he s covered 
we ve already checked
with your carrier  mr archibald 
there are no provisions in your policy
for a procedure of this magnitude 
that s a mistake 
not that you re making a mistake 
i m just saying that i m insured 
my son s covered 
mrs archibald 
do you have coverage 
no  i ve only been working
at the supermarket a couple months 
  you don t get benefits until   
  doesn t matter  we got insurance 
i can see here
that you don t own your home 
you have no stocks 
no bonds  no investments 
  you have a little over  1 000 in savings 
  but we got insurance 
that may very well be  you re going to
have to check with your carrier 
in the meantime  we re going to
have to treat this as a cash account 
  what 
  how much does a transplant cost 
wait a minute 
how much does it cost 
transplant surgery 
doctors  fees  postoperative care 
immunosuppressant drugs   
you re looking at a minimum of  250 000 
if you opt for transplant surgery 
that is your choice 
but the hospital maintains a very
strict policy with regard to cash patients 
we require down payment before we put
a patient s name on a receivers  list 
  how much 
  what kind of down payment 
30      75 000 
 75 000   
  to put my son s name on a list 
  our son is upstairs dying 
  all you can do is talk about money 
  it costs money to provide health care 
it s expensive for you 
it s expensive for us 
you re going to
have to guarantee payment
before i can put
your son s name on the list 
mr and mrs archibald 
please wait 
if you people don t want to treat our son 
we ll take him over to county memorial 
  you don t want to do that 
  they have to treat him 
heart transplantation is
always considered an elective procedure 
  you re in the right place 
  what are we supposed to do 
talk to your insurance company again 
check with our human resources
department for medical assistance 
there s money  there s children s
state services and medicaid 
you find a way to keep him here 
you just don t take no for an answer 
your policy has changed 
mr archibald 
changed to what 
we ve recently switched carriers
from a ppo to an hmo 
it s a less expensive policy 
unfortunately  there are some restrictions 
  what kind of restrictions 
  here s how it works 
non management
part time employees such as yourself
only qualify for second tier
catastrophic coverage 
i m not part time  i m full time 
it s just slow right now 
sure  but your coverage
is based on hours worked 
like i said 
you only qualify for second tier 
that has a maximum
payout limit of  20 000 
what 
you have been taking money
out of my cheque every week 
i ve been paying into
this policy for years 
that s why we re going to cover you
for the full  20 000 
you re kidding me  right 
come on 
you have dropped me from full time
to part time  you switched carriers 
now you re telling me i m not fully covered
even though i got a policy that says i am 
  it doesn t seem right  does it 
  no  it doesn t  my son is very sick 
if i m not covered 
i got a serious problem 
i understand that 
but there s nothing i can do 
  you can file an appeal 
  yeah 
here you go  that takes
about seven working days 
says here you already have
medical insurance 
  not enough 
  what little we have is already used up 
you on welfare 
  you should be on welfare 
  we both have jobs 
that s too bad 
i m sorry  i can t help you 
try county medical 
yes  ma am  i need to speak
to somebody in financial aid 
no  i don t want to hold 
i ve been holding for 15 minutes 
we don t have enough money 
should i get another job 
  i m not yelling 
  you re yelling in here 
next  please 
  wrong line  window 15 
  what 
window 15 
  no 
  no  what 
no  you don t qualify 
my son is dying  i m broke 
if i don t qualify  who the hell does 
i m sorry 
i don t need you to be sorry 
i need you to help me 
no  this is an appeal 
an appeal is for an already existing claim 
you needed to file a grievance 
  you filed the wrong paperwork 
  wait a minute 
you re going to have to resubmit 
it could take 30 days 
  i don t have 30 days 
  i know 
i m getting sick of the run around 
i need my son s name on that list 
your account is in excess of  30 000 
the hospital has bent over backwards
to help you out 
  is that right 
  yes  it is right 
but there is a limit to our generosity 
once and for all 
your insurance does not cover this 
take it 
  watch your step 
  this thing is frigging heavy 
get out of the way 
friends  one among us
is suffering in great pain today 
this is a good man 
  you can t say
that you re not going to pitch   
bernie frowned 
puzzled by babe s answer   okay  babe   
let us pray 
god of mercy  into his hands
your son jesus christ
commended his spirit
at his last hour 
into those same hands 
we commend your servant   
you should try that news guy
does all them special investigative reports 
you know the one 
the guy with the frigging hair 
  pretty boy  what s his frigging name 
  lampley 
  tuck lampley

my son mike  he fell into heart failure
at this little league game 
i got full insurance from the job 
now they re telling me they won t pay 
what about the hospital 
don t they have to cover it 
  that s what i was saying 
  they re telling me i got to pay cash 
otherwise i got to take my son home
and watch him die 
we was thinking you can do
one of them special interest pieces 
send donations 
write your congressman 
anything you can do 
mr lampley  would help 
i think what s happening to your son
is outrageous  i want to help 
i got to run this by my producers

they re not going to send him home 
i gave them money yesterday 
it doesn t matter  listen to me 
they are releasing him 
i talked to the hospital 
they said    i ll take care of it 
you always take care of everything 
but it s never enough  is it 
you need to do something 
do you hear me 
do something 
you re doing great  you really are 
you ve gained what  five pounds 
you re the only patient i have
who eats the food in this place

fine 
i m looking at the brochure last night 
it says this hospital

that s  75 million worth
of heart surgeries

you can t do one for me in good faith 
i waived my fee in your son s case 
i know you re not asking   
nobody asked you to waive the fee 
i can raise the money 
i already came up with  22 000 
and i swear to god on my life
i will pay for this
if you give me the opportunity 
i m only getting 20 hours on the job 
i can do this  i can pay 
i swear to god 
i ll pay you the money back 
i don t know how 
but i promise you i will  trust me 
i give you my word
as a man  please

with what  besides  i m not sticking
my neck on the line for  8 50 an hour 
  pay dirt 
  are you nuts 
  what the hell are you doing 
  looking out for number one 
you want to stay alive  sit tight
and wait for the cavalry to get here 
the cops are coming in shooting 
they don t care about his kid 
once he realises that 
we re all history

he don t look so bad to me 
 ethyl chloride   just like mace

i am not a slob 
i have a life 
it means something to me 
i m not going down
in this shit hole  no  sir 
back it up 
how are you 
how you all doing 
good  how are you 
how are you  fellows 
is it true the man inside
wants an operation for his son 
everything good 
good to see you 
  do you know what weapon he has 
  you ll talk to me  right 
i ll let you know when i know  okay 
you ll be the first 
  i ll let you know later 
  gus  how are you 
  how you doing  frank  it s hot 
  yeah  it is 
  a little early for heavy artillery  isn t it 
  maybe  maybe not 
  you should tell me  what s going on 
  you re looking at it 
a very upset father inside  we ll give him
a couple of minutes to cool off 
let s not give him too much time 
let s end this quick and quiet 
  that s the plan 
  all right  good 
in that case  i m just here
to lend my support in any way that i can 
i don t need a babysitter on this 
it s under control 
  is it 
  yes 
all right  can t have people
running around the street using guns 
makes it look like the city s unsafe 
besides  i got to be here 
chief doesn t show up 
looks like he s asleep at the wheel 
just stay out of my way 
the tv cameras are over there 
they should make you feel
right at home 
right  why don t you just relax 
  why can t you relax 
  i m fine 
  why don t you just do your job 
  i m doing my job 
we re both cops  right 
we re on the same side  remember 
  right 
  right 
it s good to see you  thanks 
yes  mr mayor 
i ll see you in a little bit 
no  we got it  i got it 
how are you 
the old man  looking for his depends 
he leave them over here 
what i don t understand is why
they never found it  the doctors 
my son has had clean checkups
every year since the day he was born 
  how could the doctors not pick it up 
  he might not have been tested enough 
why not 
you got an hmo  right 
there s your answer 
hmos pay their doctors not to test 
it s their way of keeping costs down 
say mike did need additional testing
and insurance says they won t cover them 
the doctor keeps his mouth shut 
and come christmas 
the hmo sends the doctor
a fat ass bonus cheque 
  is that true 
  possible  not likely  but possible 
these doctors may have known
what was wrong with my son 
and they could have
treated him all along 
  who knows  i don t know 
  don t take this personal  doc 
  you re a bunch of crooks 
  you don t know what you re talking about 
  what about that thing you take 
  the thing 
that promise 
  it s called the hippocratic oath 
  more like the hypocritical oath 
how s it go  doc 
 i solemnly swear to take care
of the sick and damn near dying 
unless they ain t got major medical  
  something like that 
  you ve got it perfectly 
it s funny  but it s not far from the truth 
this shit happens all the time 
paramedics bring in
some accident victim 
when the boys in accounting find out
they can t pay  they send them packing 
  hospitals can t turn people away 
  isn t there laws against that 
there s also ways around those laws 
we have to stabilise them 
after that  we re off the hook 
  that s not how it works 
  that s exactly how it works 
maybe not on the fifth floor 
but in here if you don t have money 
you get a band aid  a foot in the ass 
and you re out the door 
enough already  i ve heard all the bitching
and moaning i can stand for one day 
if you all want to regard me as some kind
of blood sucking vampire  great 
i ll be the bad guy 
but who s holding the fucking gun 
sir  lieutenant 
this is frank grimes 
you pick up the phone  you get me 
  what can i do for you 
  what s going on with the list 
  i m working on it  but i need time 
  time i don t have 
  let s talk about the hostages 
  what do you want to know 
  what s going on  how are they 
  they re fine  they re full 
we re eating candy bars
and discussing hmos  waiting for you 
  i want you to let some of them go 
  for what 
i do for you  you do for me 
show some good faith 
a lot of nervous people out here 
make everybody breathe a lot easier
if we saw some happy faces 
i ll do for you when you start doing for me 
i want my kid s name on that list 
  i m not kidding around here 
  good faith 
  good faith only takes you so far   
  what s that 
   merit system  so far 
you haven t earned any points 
excuse me 
i need to talk to you

the gunman has just freed
several hostages 
who will immediately be debriefed
by members of the crisis team 
will the man known as john q
get a heant for his little boy 
only time will tell 
from hope memorial hospital 
i m tuck lampley 
is it true an ambulance dropped off
a victim after the gunman took over 
he unlocked the door
and he let him inside 
  can you comment 
  the man was critically injured 
if he hadn t let him in 
he would have died 
  ma am  are you all right 
  i feel good  we re having a baby 
ma am  any comments
about the gunman 
  john q very good man 
  the gunman 
very good man 
they got a camera

  they re looking at something 
  i want to know what  can you get it 
  boss  if they got it  i can get it 
you give in  there s going to be guns
in every hospital in the country 
you think mr archibald s
the only one who has a sick child 
have you checked the hiv ward 
there s a whole floor full 
people get sick  they die 
that s the way it goes 
i m faced with
decisions like this every day 
there s a man threatening innocent people
because you refused to help his son 
there are 50 million people in this country
without medical insurance 
if you d like to change it 
call your congressman 
excuse me  why don t we just tell him
his son s name s on the list 
doesn t that make sense 
how s he going to know  anyway 
sir  pardon me 
can you come take a look at this 
sarge  chief moroe 
this is wally pitoniak  head of security 
nice to meet you 
i got your spot 
here s your sight 
that s going to be your perch 
the x there  that s your phone 
  which phone 
  bring it up  jeff 
the phone right there 
it is  tom  but chief moroe maintains
the police will do whatever is necessary
to preserve the lives
and safety of these hostages 
  thanks  tuck 
  this country  man 
can t go anywhere anymore without
getting mugged or murdered or stabbed 
kids killing their classmates 
drive bys 
  i won t even go into a post office 
  shut up  mitch 
you shut up 
i hate the little bastard  but he s right 
you know how easy it is to get a gun 
five minutes  gun show 
i understand your kid is sick  john 
but what makes him better than me 
  i got a life  too 
  but you got insurance 
so what  are you going to shoot me 
that s what you re telling the cops 
if your son doesn t get
the very first heart available  we all die 
how s it going to end  john 
what s your move 
i got no moves  okay 
i don t know what i m going to do 
i m waiting on a miracle  okay 
i m waiting on an act of god 
could we have a word
with you  please 
this is all my fault 
when the hospital told me
they were releasing mikey 
i called john and yelled at him 
told him to do something  anything 
but i never thought   
i understand 
is he a violent man  mrs archibald 
no  he s sweet and gentle 
he wouldn t hurt a fly 
that s not what he s saying 
he s talking about killing people 
i may be fishing  but has he spent time
in the military or anything like that 
  what is this 
  what 
i see what s going on here 
you re trying to get me to say something
you can use against my husband 
he s in a lot of trouble 
we re going to need you to talk to him 
let s get something straight  mister 
you cannot use me
to build a case against my husband 
i support him in everything he does 
i m on his side  not yours 
and you don t talk to me 
i would tell you
what i think of you   
   but i m a christian woman 
now you two leave me alone 
i have a sick child to look after 
i ve decided to put michael s name
on the recipient list 
the hospital will pay for everything 
really 
really 
thank you 
oh  god  thank you 
you re good 
  excuse me 
  quite the performance 
  what are you talking about 
  comforting embrace  sincere look

as you can see  the crowd
in front of hope memorial is growing 
the s w a t  team has arrived 
the situation is becoming tense 
standing next to me is james palumbo 
friend of john archibald 
mr palumbo  what can you tell us
about john archibald 
you know  i got to be honest  tuck 
this whole thing sucks 
it all could have been avoided
so incredibly easy 
none of this had to happen
if john had been a frigging millionaire
or if his last name was rockefeller 
but sometimes john don t get it 
he don t understand that what
we hold sacred in this country isn t values 
it s value that s important 
we got haves  we got have nots 
we ve got white collar 
blue collar  and no collar 
inside there we got surgery 
outpatient surgery  out of luck surgery 
there s a lot of people out there
who don t got 250 grand in their billfold 
to shame a man like that
and back him into a corner 
seems to me that something
is out of whack  not someone 
but what do i know 
i m a factory worker 
i see this is making you upset 
but if you could look into the camera
and speak to john q right now 
what would you say to him 
i m there with you

police chief moroe

you lied to me  lieutenant 
you said you were going to
call me back  but you didn t 
i gave you your hostages 
but you didn t call me back  why 
  because you want me dead 
  nobody wants to kill you 
nobody wants to kill me 
none of these guys  not him 
what is this 
what did you think would happen 
you want truth  here s some truth 
this is going to end up bad for you 
there s only two ways out of here 
jail or dead 
my son is very sick
and he needs some help 
it s hard to be a man these days 
hard to know what the right thing is 
  but put the gun down  john 
  you re not hearing me  frank 
my son is sick  that s it 
there s nothing else  end of story 
when people are sick 
they deserve a little help 
sick  help 
i am not going to bury my son 
my son is going to bury me 
you think these people
give a shit about you  they don t 
you re just the cause of the moment 
nobody cares  that s the real truth 
nobody cares  only you 
and it s only you and me out here
and all these guns pointed at you 
what do you want to do 
it s your call 
i want my son 
  i want my son inside with me 
  can t do it  john 
you give me my boy 
i give you your sniper 
it s all over 
you bring my son 
i give up   
   everybody goes home 
everybody s safe 
you bring me my son 
come on 
all right 
what do you think  frank 
give it to him  he s not going to
hurt anybody with his boy in there 
the object is to get hostages out 
not bring them in 
it s not a hostage 
it s his son 
have all these people
been on the news 
it s your call  frank 
all right  give it to him 
  hold it

i m his mother 
i need to be in there 
stop  stop right there 
go  beat it  now 
we re in trouble  mike s blood pressure
has dropped into the mid 40s 
his atrial blood pressure
should be in the low teens  it s 35 
i m sorry  john 
without a new heart 
he s not going to make it 
then take mine 
  what 
  you heard me 
take my heart 
and you put it in mike 
  you done lost your damn mind 
  you can t be serious 
you bet i m serious 
i m dead serious 
oh  my god 
  you ll be dead 
  and my son will live 
  you can t do this 
  it s the only way 
  physically  you can t do this 
  i kill myself 
you open me up  take my heart 
  it s perfect 
  that s just crazy 
we can t just remove your heart
and put it into michael s body 
there are too many unknowns 
matching donor and recipient
is extremely complicated 
  critical tests have to be taken 
  like what 
cross matches for blood type 
chest cavity measurements 
if blood tissues
are not completely compatible   
i know about compatibility 
we ve been tested up the wazoo 
we re both b positive 
our tissues match 
his heart s three times the size
of normal  so mine will fit 
  you know we re compatible 
  out of the question  too risky 
  i m telling you he will make it 
  can t do it 
if i m laying dead  you re not going to
take my heart and save his life 
you ll let two die instead of one
because of a technicality 
  i think what john is trying to do is right 
  me  too  i think it s so brave 
what do you think mike would want 
what about your wife 
mike s too young to know
what s good for him 
it s my job to protect him 
denise would do the same thing 
i know what s happening to mike is bad 
matter of fact  it s the worst 
but killing yourself
ain t going to solve a damn thing 
sometimes you just
got to let go and let god   
just accept it  brother 
accept it 
accept what 
that mike is going to die 
no  i don t accept that  ever 
i reject that out of hand 
all right  he s a patient to you 
i understand  but he s a good kid 
he loves bodybuilding 
he wants to be a bodybuilder 
can you believe that 
he s funny  you d like him 
  you d like him if you got to know him 
  i do like him 
then  please  i m just begging you 
step outside the rules 
i d like to  john  i really would 
but what you re asking crosses the line 
it is completely unethical 
i m crossing the line  you re crossing 
the whole system is crossing the line 
maybe you don t understand
what i m talking about 
i don t give a damn 
my son s going to live 
maybe you haven t figured that out by now 
i ll do whatever i got to do for him to live 
what are you going to do 
shoot me if i don t operate 
i m going to kill myself 
all right 
let s just see what happens 
that s what this is about  right 
he needs a donor 
somebody s got to die for him to live 
i m his father  it s me 
  all right 
  all right what 
i ll do it  if that s what you want 
  you re going to let him kill himself 
  once he s dead  why not 
you are the finest surgeon
i have ever known 
you cannot throw your career 
your life away for this 
  if you do this  you re finished 
  what are they going to do  sue me 
disbar me 
evict me from the country club 
this is still a hospital 
if there s a heart available 
i m not going to let it go to waste 
doctor  mr maguire 
let s get ready for surgery 
  they re ready to harvest 
  all right  hurry up  guys

do something  you do it 
because your word is your bond  son 
it s all you have 
and money  you make money
if you get a chance 
even if you got to sell out

make as much money as you can 
don t be stupid like your father

be kind to people 
when somebody chooses you   
we talked about this

faith based health care plans
