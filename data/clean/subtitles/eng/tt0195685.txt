if you need someone to look after your
kids after school  or whatever   
   i don t have a job now 
oh  that s a great recommendation 
 i m unemployed  
by choice 
i work when i need to 
what do you do 
live off your trust fund 
i do construction  which pays good 
and i make it last by living cheap 
is that supposed to impress me 
hey  bed 
your little ghosts 
you always this hard on people
who try to help you 
i m out of practice 
well  let me remind you then 
the polite thing is to say thank you 
i d start it off with that 
then    hey  that s
a really nice offer 
i don t mind taking you up on that  
why do you want to watch my kids 
 i like kids 
 right 
i like hanging out with them 
they keep it simple 
you re home every afternoon 
i m usually working on my bike 
if it doesn t work out  you can always
send them back to the chicken fat lady 
this isn t gonna get you laid 
get in bed 
good  because i don t
find you attractive either 
then we re even 
i m so glad we got that
out of the way 
i feel much better 
i do too  because now i can
just look after the kids   
   and i don t have to worry
about you coming on to me 
bring the phone into the changing room 
of course they won t 
mrs  masry  don t be such a tease 
hold on  just hold on  yeah 
sorry  would you mind
if i investigate this 
investigate what 
this real estate thing
with the jensens  the pro bono 
i wanna make sure i understand
what i m reading 
 yeah  yeah  sure 
 you don t mind 
okay  great  thanks 
donna jensen 
i m erin brockovich 
with masry and vititoe 
oh  you re a lawyer 
hell  no  i hate lawyers 
i just work for  em 
do you have a minute 
i don t mean to be a pain to pg e
after all they ve done for hinkley   
   but if they want this place 
they re gonna have to pay for it 
you didn t put the house up for sale 
they just wanted to buy it 
oh  yeah  yeah 
oh  i don t wanna move 
uproot the kids 
i ve got a couple of girls 
honest to god  i don t know
if i have the energy 
you know  i ve been sick 
me and pete both have 
the idea of selling  if they re
not gonna pay us properly   
   i don t see the point 
yeah  yeah  i can see that 
i guess the only thing
that confused me   
not that your medical problems
aren t important 
how come those files are in
with all the real estate stuff 
there s just so much correspondence 
i just keep it all in one place 
i m sorry  i just don t see why you re
corresponding with pg e   
   about your medical problems
in the first place 
well  they paid
for the doctor s visit 
they did 
you bet  paid for a checkup
for the whole family 
not like with insurance  where you pay
and maybe you see some money in a year 
they just took care of it 
just like that 
we never saw a bill 
wow  why d they do that 
the chromium 
 the what 
 the chromium 
well  that s what
kicked this whole thing off 
 what kind of chromium 
 there s more than one 
there s straight up chromium 
it does good things for the body 
there s chrom three 
which is fairly benign 
there s chrom six 
hexavalent chromium   
   which  depending on the amounts 
can be harmful 
harmful how  what would you get 
with repeated exposure
to toxic levels  anything   
   from chronic headaches to respiratory
disease  liver failure   
   heart failure  reproductive failure 
bone or organ deterioration 
plus  of course  any type of cancer 
so that stuff  it kills people 
yeah  definitely 
highly toxic  highly carcinogenic 
it gets into your dna  so you pass
the trouble to your kids  very bad 
well  what s it used for 
a rust inhibitor 
the utility plants use piston engines
that get hot  they run water through 
chromium s in the water
to prevent corrosion 
how do i find out what kind
of chromium they use in hinkley 
 been to their water board 
 what s that 
every county has one 
they keep records of anything
in their jurisdiction 
 you should find something there 
 county water board 
 alrighty  well  thanks 
 good luck 
i wouldn t advertise
what you re looking for 
incriminating records have a way of
disappearing when people smell trouble 
i ll remember that  thanks 
this guy s too smart 
 t s only a matter of time
until he makes his move 
he positions women employees
in such a way   
   that they have no choice
but to respond or lose theirjobs   
 that s a heavy door 
 let me give you a hand 
thank you very much  aren t you
a gentleman  mr 
 scott 
 mr  scott 
pleased to meet you 
i m erin 
erin  erin  cool 
what can i do for you  erin 
believe it or not  i m on the prowl
for some water records 
you come to the right place 
i guess i did 
just tell me what you wanna look at 
and i d be glad to dig  em out 
i wish i knew  it s for my boss 
he s in this water dispute   
   and he wants me to find all kinds
of papers  from all kinds of places 
you know 
it would probably be easiest   
   if i squeezed back there
and poked around myself 
 would that be all right with you 
 come on back 
 i m gonna need you to sign in here 
 oh  sure 
  pattee   is that your middle name 
 no  maiden 
oh  you re married

i can t afford one 
i can t even afford my phone 
i got fired 
what 
what do you mean  you got fired 
you re working so hard

you are living next door to a real 
live fucking beauty queen 
i still have my tiara 
and i thought it meant i was gonna
do something important with my life 
that it meant i was someone 
you re someone to me

that i have to survive 
because i ll tell you the truth   
   l m not up to it 
i get up in the centre of the stage   
   and i have the big
bouquet of flowers 
i had my foot out like this 
and i said 
 i will devote my entire reign
as miss wichita   
   to bringing an end to world hunger 
and to the creation
of a peaceful earth   
   for every man  woman and child  
 how long were you miss wichita 
 one year 
by the time i got through
opening new supermarkets   
   i only had a few weeks left
to work on hunger   
   and world peace 
 world peace 
i don t know what i was thinking 
what about you  huh 
what about me 
let me tell you something 
let me get that out of your hair 
 thank you 
 nice 
you re a very special lady 
don t be too nice to me  okay 
why 
makes me nervous 
it s some slim pickings here  baby 
maybe that s ed mcmahon 
let s go see 
wrong ed 
what are you doing here 
i had an interesting call
this afternoon from dr  frankel   
   from ucla 
 oh  yeah 
he wanted you to know that the   legal
limit for hexavalent chromium   
   is 05 parts per million   
   and at the rate you mentioned 
 58  it could be   
   responsible for the cancers 
in that family you asked about   
   the jensens 
well  wasn t that nice of him 
funny how some people help people 
and others just fire them 
i m sorry  you were gone 
i assumed you were off having fun 
why the hell would you assume that 
maybe you look like someone
who has a lot of fun 
by that standard 
i assume you never get laid 
i m married 
look  what is this    what s the story
on this cancer stuff 
you wanna know  you have to hire me
back  i got a ton of bills to pay 
fine 
fine 
donna just put in these new cabinets 
stained the wood and all   
   when she gets a call from pg e 
saying a freeway s gonna be built   
   and they wanna buy her house
for an off ramp 
the husband s sick with hodgkin s 
she keeps getting tumours   
   believing one has nothing
to do with the other 
because pg e told her
about the chromium 
they had a seminar 
they invited 200 people
from the area   
   had it at the plant   
   about chromium three
and how good it is   
   when they re using chromium six 
that document you found
at the water board   
   the one that says
about the bad chromium   
you didn t happen to make a copy 
did you 
of course i did 
could i have a look 
i want a raise 
and benefits  including dental 
it s not how i do business 
 what way is that 
 extortion 
a 5  raise  we ll talk
about benefits later 
ten  there are lots of other places
i could get work 
10  raise and benefits  but that s it 
i m drawing the line 
he s drawing the line 
this the only thing you got 
well  the place is a pigsty 
there s probably more 
i know how those things are run 
what makes you think
you can just walk in there   
   and find what we need 
they re called boobs  ed 
yes  i m sure it is 
i understand 
i agree  i agree  i m going to 
right now 
i m almost done  look 
how are we doing 
we re doing great 
good 
well  you ve got quite a lot
done already  so   
sorry  we need to have
those records back now 
no 
these papers are public record 
i m not leaving   
   until they re copied 
fax these to this number  okay 
 all of them 
 all of them 
an on site monitoring well 
 that means it was   
 it s on the pg e property 
and you say that this stuff 
this hexavalent chromium   
 well  it s poisonous 
 yeah 
it s gotta be different than what s
in our water  because ours is okay 
the guys from pg e told me 
they sat right in the kitchen
and told me that it was fine 
i know  but the toxicologist
that i ve been talking to   
   he gave me a list of problems that
come from hexavalent chromium exposure 
everything you all have
is on that list 
no  no  no 
that s not what   
that s not what our doctor said 
he said that   
well  that one s got absolutely
nothing to do with the other 
but pg e paid for that doctor 
ashley 
shanna 
get out of the pool 
 how come 
 i said so  that s why 
the minute brenda sent that fax   
   l m saying  the second she
pressed the  send  button   
   pg e s claim department
was on the phone to me   
   scheduling a meeting 
so you think that   
let me do it 
you re driving me nuts 
you think we scared them 
taking the trouble to send someone   
   sounds like they re
sitting up and taking notice 
mr  foil 
in the interest
of putting this to rest   
   pg e is willing to offer
the jensens  250 000 for their home 
 250 000 
in terms of land value in hinkley   
   we feel that s a more
than fair price 
how about in terms
of medical expenses 
 250 000 isn t gonna come close to what
this family s gonna spend on doctors 
i understand they ve had bad luck 
health wise 
they have my sympathies 
but that s not pg e s fault 
you re kidding  right 
look at these readings 
pg e s own technicians documented   
   toxic levels of hexavalent chromium
in those wells   
   on numerous occasions 
everything the jensens have had   
   is proven reaction to exposure to
hexavalent chromium  they have had   
they have had   
breast cysts  uterine cancer 
hodgkin s  immune deficiencies   
   asthma  nosebleeds   
a million things could
cause those problems 
poor diet  bad genes 
irresponsible lifestyle 
our offer is final
and more than fair 
wait a minute 
i thought we were negotiating here 
 250 000 is all
i m authorized to offer 
i ll present your offer to my clients 
i doubt they ll accept 
before you go off on a crusade   
   remember who you re dealing with 
pg e s a 28 billion
dollar corporation 
28 billion dollars 
i didn t know it was that much 
wow  twenty eight billion 
holy cow 
they made an offer 
no  a million would have been
an offer  they send that   
   mail clerk down to jerk me off 
waste my time 
why 
you heard what that kid said 
they have 28 billion dollars 
they can afford to waste time 
 you can t 
 am i made of money 
 why are you yelling 
 i m pissed 
 fuck you 
 fuck you back 
i really hate you sometimes 
no  you love me 
you ve been reading for hours 
i m a slow reader 
excuse me 
 are you erin brockovich 
 yeah 
i m tom robinson 
this is my wife  mandy 
we used to live across
the street from the jensens 
i think you know donna 
pg e bought our house last year 
well  the vet said they had
a bunch of tumours and stuff 
well  you can see
they couldn t really walk 
how many were born like this 
twelve or 13 or so 
when donna told us what
you told her about the chromium   
   we figured it might have
something to do with this 
yeah  it might 
really  may i keep these 
 yeah 
 okay  great 
thank you so much 
i really appreciate it 
there s something else too 
what 
mandy  here  has had   
   five miscarriages 
i m so sorry 
i figured it was something i did 
like  when i smoked marijuana 
maybe   
   or took birth control pills   
   but then donna
said that you thought   
   this chromium might be
to blame for her problems 
so i figured maybe   
   it wasn t just me 
i have to take a bath 
you should go in 
they re not asleep 
beth and katie are 
 how was school 
 fine 
 did you do your homework 
 yeah 
any problems 
i know you re upset 
but the way this job is   
   things come up at the last minute 
things that i gotta deal with 
fine 
please don t be mad at me 
i m doing this for us  i know
it s hard for you to understand   
   but don t you want mommy
to be good at her job 
i don t miss dinner all the time 
we all ate together last night 
you were reading the whole time 
there s something about this thing
i don t understand  mr  masry 
if pg e messed with our water   
   why would they say anything
about it to us at all 
why not just keep quiet about it 
to establish a statute of limitations 
in a case like this 
you only have one year   
   from the time you learn about
the problem to file suit 
so pg e figures   
    we ll let the cat out of the bag 
tell them the water isn t perfect 
if we can ride out the year
with no one suing   
   we ll be in the clear forever  
but they told us more than a year ago 
 that s okay  we re not suing 
 not yet 
all we re doing
is using this information   
   to get you a nice purchase
price on your house 
and you two  a comparable
retroactive bonus on your sale price 
pg e still looks good
to their shareholders 
they re not in a lawsuit 
all they re doing is buying property 
doesn t say how much
this thing s gonna cost us 
my fee is 40  of whatever
you get awarded 
boy  do i know how you feel 
the first time i heard that number 
i said   you re kidding me  
forty goddamned percent 
i m the one that s injured  and
this joker sits at a desk all day   
   and he wants
almost half of my reward 
 erin  can l    
 but then   
   i asked him   
   what he makes
if i don t get anything 
then i don t get anything either 
plus  he s out all the costs 
so i realized   
   he s taking a chance too 
you got a pen  honey 
all right  then 
oh  i made a bundt cake 
who would like coffee and cake 
 i do 
 thanks  but we have to get back 
have a fucking cup of coffee  ed 
coffee will be great  thank you 
 all right 
 i ll help you 
my wife makes really good bundt cake 
i love bundt cake 
well  it seems like everybody in
the family ended up with a rash somehow 
it seemed like no matter what
we did  it always came back 
over what kind of period of time 
oh  long time  you know  years 
i never did keep track of it 
kids are sick 
animals need to be fed 
just couldn t get rid of it 
well  mrs  de soto said   
   that she wasn t
exactly sure what you had 
we know what it is 
 it s gastrointestinal   
 gastrointestinal cancer 
 she got sick about nine months ago   
 nine months ago 
and they operated on her
about six months ago 
 the intestine 
 right 
 hi  i m erin brock   
 i know who you are 
donna called me 
can i come in 
we re not interested
in getting involved 
can i ask why 
what s the point 
donna told me that you ve been sick
and that your kids were sick   
you people don t give a shit 
anything to get what you want 
thanks for having me   
it s a good day to come by 
she s feeling good 
well  mike ambrosino had remembered   
   that he had seen
you folks at the hospital 
that s what brought me out here 
yeah  we ve been there
from time to time 
and you  wooftie 
ain t you a beauty 
you drive all the boys
crazy  don t you 
i can see it in your eyes 
you drive them wild 
you do  don t you 
torture them 
it s good for them 
don t teach her anything too early 
yeah  she can t wait
to get on her new dress 
she wants to go to school 
we re trying to do that 
in a few months 
yeah  get her out
of her nightgown here 
she s gonna do it 
absolutely not 
 why not 
 because i said no 
the reason pg e even talks to us   
   is because this is a quiet
real estate dispute 
we add plaintiffs  we re in
the middle of a toxic trot   
   with a statute problem 
against a massive utility 
no  thank you 
okay  so here s what i ll do 
i ll go to the daniels  
the nicest people you ll ever meet   
   who watch their girl fight
like a dog against cancer 
i ll tell them   
   we can t help them  because you
just don t wanna work that hard 
work hard 
let me tell you something 
i ve worked all my life 
i ve built a firm and kept it alive
through lawsuits and injunctions 
i ve survived
a quadruple bypass  cancer   
   being born with one
kidney and diabetes 
i personally managed
to save a million dollars   
   over 30 years  getting
clients 10 times that 
don t tell me i don t work hard 
don t tell me i can t stop 
take a breath and enjoy life 
what the hell do you know
about any of this 
something like this  erin 
it could take forever 
they re a huge corporation 
they ll bury us
in paperwork for years 
i m just a guy with
a small  private firm 
who knows they poisoned
people and lied about it 
we can get these people 
with a little effort  i think we
can nail their asses to the wall 
with your legal expertise 
you believe that 
 don t you ever just know 
 do you know about money 
they settle due to lack of money 
you know what toxicologists
and geology experts cost 
we re looking at  100 000 a month 
 i ve already spent some of my savings 
 we ll figure it out 
i don t know shit  but i know the
difference between right and wrong 
 lovers  quarrel 
 bite my ass  krispy kreme 
i feel you looking at me 
i m sorry 
how many families are we talking about 
four more  eleven people so far 
there s more 
i found a document at the water board 
a toxic test well reading from 1967 
more people have lived
there since then 
this is a whole different ball game 
a much bigger deal 
kind of like david
and what s his name 
kind of like david and what s 
his name s whole fucking family 
here s the deal 
lf  and only if  you find all the
evidence to back this up  i ll do it 
you re doing the right thing 
remind me of that when
i m filing for bankruptcy 
of course  gathering
evidence is a big job 
hell of a lot bigger than just filing 
i ll be working a lot harder   
   taking on a lot
more responsibility 
 i don t believe this 
 a raise wouldn t hurt 
i ll spend more time in my car   
   so i ll probably be needing
one of those cell phones 
 i don t believe this 
 just a little phone 
thank you 
whoever is behind you 
just play 
go  roll the dice and play 
come on  aren t you gonna play 
roll the dice 
come on 
hello 
 s this the erin brockovich that s
been snooping around the water board 
yeah  who s this 
you should watch your step 
a young lady with three young
children really should think again 
who is this 
do you understand what   m saying 
who is it 
 t s okay 
i m not gonna quit because of
one creepy phone call  george 
come on  erin 
a job shouldn t put you in danger 
i m not in danger 
 the phone might be tapped but   
 what 
that s usual  we ve got a dead
bolt  it s not a big deal 
you don t think you re
a little out of your league 
that s what those pg e
fucks want me to think 
but they re wrong 
erin  there are plenty
of jobs out there 
how would you know 
what that s supposed to mean 
you got a problem with me caring
for your kids instead of a job 
i can get a job 
you can leave the kids with
the chicken fat lady again 
i said i m sorry 
keep your voice down 
i know what these kids can
sleep through  better than you 
scott  tell me something 
does pg e pay you
to cover their ass 
or do you just do it out
of the kindness of your heart

we had a big event around here 
beth started talking 
what 
beth  my beth 
we were sitting around   
   and she pointed
at a ball and said 
 ball  
out of the blue like that 
 t was pretty intense 
you know  seeing
somebody s first word 
of all the words in her life 
that s the first word she says   ball  
she pointed her little finger   
   with her beautiful  soft 
chubby little arm   
   and her cheeks 
 t s like she d been
looking at it for months   
   and couldn t get it out 
but knowing what it was 
she didn t look away or anything 
she was just sitting
there with her arm out 
you should ve seen
matthew and katie and me 
ourjaws just dropped 
we must ve stood there for three or
four minutes andjust looked at her 
she just had her arm out
like that   ball  
and  you know  her little
lips wrapped around it 
 t was great 
 t was intense

 hello 
 hello  sweetness

 what 
i would like to go home

we got a lot done 
did you  i think
i ate three watermelons 
piggyback 
let s go  brother  get on 
careful 
here  get on me  now 
erin  excuse me 
this is nelson perez  he works
at the compressor station 
 hi  nice to meet you 
 pg e 
oh  hi 
 i ve come at a bad time 
 no 
 can you just give me one    
 of course  sure 
thank you 
you know what 
why don t you guys go ahead without
me  and i ll get a ride with ed 
 no  mom 
 no  sweetie  i ll be right behind you 
i ll be right behind you  all right 
i really    this is so   
 fine  go  go  go 
get down  bud 
hang on tight there 
help your sister
with her shoes  let s go 
this is so helpful 
is it okay if i write this down 
i have so many questions 
i wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers  just everything 
i wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers  just everything 
they use the hexachrome here  in these
cooling towers  as an anticorrosive 
then they dump the excess
water into these ponds 
i don t remember seeing
any ponds up there 
they ve been covered over 
and not too carefully 
if you dig one inch
under the surface   
   dirt s as green
as a fucking shamrock 
and that s what
caused the contamination 
it didn t help  but no 
the problem started on the bottom 
according to   
   this   
   in most cases you would
line these ponds   
   so the shit didn t seep
into the ground 
 but guess what 
 they skipped that step 
here are the ponds 
the plume comes down   
   and hinkley is down here   
   it s 14 years of hexachrome
flowing into the groundwater 
jesus 
this guy just offered
all this information 
well  yeah  nelson cares
what s in those ponds 
he used to spend time wading
around them  that was his job 
shit 
what s the matter 
i don t know if we can pull this off 
this is a monster case 
we re up to 411 plaintiffs 
we ve taken 162 declarations 
probably hundreds more
out there have moved away 
we have to find them 
it s taking time 
money s going out 
nothing s coming in 
i have to take a second mortgage 
 so 
 so 
i have to tell you 
i ve been making inquiries
with other firms   
   bigger firms to share
some of the cost 
they all said no 
said they don t have it 
we got pg e by the balls 
pg e hinkley  but nobody ll get rich
unless we pin this on corporate   
   in san francisco 
 what do you mean 
pg e corporate claims they
didn t know about hinkley 
they knew  they had to know 
show me the document to prove it 
then they didn t know  if so  we
can t hit them with punitive damages 
with punitive damages 
it s a sum of money that can   
   have some effect
on these people s lives 
so what do we do now 
let s assume there are documents
connecting pg e hinkley and corporate   
   and they know about them 
we take our 400 or so plaintiffs
and everything you ve dug up   
   we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction 
see if they offer a reasonable
settlement  or throw more paper at us 
sounds great  let s do that 
there s a downside 
pg e will submit a demurrer 
a list attacking each complaint   
   claiming that each cause
of action has no merit 
and if the judge agrees with them   
   he ll dismiss our case 
pg e will have no reason to settle 
then it s all over 
so basically it all comes down to   
   what this one judge decides 
basically  yeah 
jesus 
well  i d got so used
to having them come up benign 
guess i just didn t expect it 
i sure wish i would ve had longer
to get used to the idea 
you think if you got no uterus   
   and no breasts   
   you re still technically a woman 
sure you are 
yeah  you just   
you re actually a happier woman 
no need to worry
about maxi pads and underwire 
we re gonna get them  aren t we 
you gotta promise me
that we re gonna get them 
  have before me
a complaint on behalf of residents   
   of hinkley  california  who
have filed against pg e 
for damages  medical expenses
and personal trauma   
   due to contamination of the ground
water in their area by the defendant 
and i have here 84 motions
to strike and demurrers   
   submitted by representatives
of pacific gas   electric 
each one attacking
the validity of this complaint 
i have reviewed all of
the information carefully 
i m ready to give my decision 
before i do  is there
anything anyone wants to say 
 no  your honour 
 no  your honour 
very well 
in the matter of the plaintiffs
of hinkley  california vs  pg e   
   it is the order of this court that
each of the 84 motions to strike   
   and demurrers are denied 
and the causes of action against
pacific gas and electric are upheld 
on a more personal note   
   as a resident here in barstow 
which is not far from hinkley   
   i am disturbed by reference   
   to evidence that suggests that not
only was hexavalent chromium used   
   but that your clients
actually sent these residents   
   pamphlets telling them
that it was good for them 
tell your clients
they re going to trial 
jesus  they look
like the secret service 
intimidation 
let the games begin 
show them into the conference room 
donald  anna   
   i wanna talk to you for a minute 
counsellors 
counsellors 
let s be honest 
 20 000 000 is more than
these people have ever dreamed of 
now that pisses me off 
first of all  since the demurrer 
we have more than 400 plaintiffs 
let s be honest  we know there s more 
they may not be sophisticated 
but they can divide   
   and  20 000 000
isn t shit after splitting it 
second of all   
   they don t dream of being rich 
they dream about
watching their kids in a pool   
   without worrying that
they ll have a hysterectomy at 20 
like rosa diaz  our client 
or have their spine deteriorate  like
stan bloom  another client of ours 
so before you come back here
with another lame ass offer   
   i want you to think real
hard about what your spine is worth 
or what you expect someone
to pay you for your uterus 
then take out your calculator
and multiply that number by 100 
anything less than that
is a waste of our time 
we had that water brought
in special for you folks 
came from hinkley 
i think this meeting s over 
damn right it is 
what the fuck  did a bomb blow up 
you letting the kids run wild 
what s that 
i saw them in a mall one day 
i said    damn   
   they ll look good on
those beautiful ears  
i bought them and i said   when erin
does something nice  i ll surprise her  
you know how long ago that was 
six months ago 
 i m sorry  i ve just   
 and so what i m thinking is   
either you gotta find
a different job or a different guy 
i mean   
there may be many men out there
who don t mind being the maid   
   and getting nothing 
but i ain t one of them 
i can t leave my job  george 
yes  you can 
people do it all the time 
how can you ask me to do that 
this job   
for the first time in my
life  i got people respecting me 
up in hinkley   
   i walk into a room  everybody shuts
up to hear what i have to say 
i never had that before  ever 
please  don t ask me to give it up 
what about your kids 
i m doing more for them now
than i did living with my parents 
one day they ll see it 
 well  what about me 
 what about you 
you think the men
who gave me those children   
   asked me what i
wanted before walking away 
all i ve ever done
is bend my life around   
   what men decide they need 
well  not now 
i m sorry  i won t do it 
well   
erin  i m not them  so   
what more can i do
to prove that to you 
stay 
what for 
i mean  you got a raise 
you can afford daycare 
you don t need me 
hi 
we can get them  pamela 
we can 
i don t wanna feel it all over again   
   and then not have it come out right 
i don t know if i could handle that 
put the kids through that 
the thing is  it doesn t matter
whether you win  lose or draw here 
you were lied to  you re sick and your
kids are sick because of those lies 
you all have to come together   
   to stand up in
a courtroom and say that 
i d bring the kids
into the hospital   
   with towels soaked
from their nosebleeds 
they called county services because
they assumed the kids were abused 
am i gonna get the best
behaviour in the office 
no 
what s with the attitude 
i just need cool  i need quiet 
hello  am i alone in the car  yes 
 i don t understand why   
 i don t wanna talk about it now 
 the other moms gave permission 
 i don t care 
 so when can i get a friggin  answer 
 don t talk to me like that 
randy s mom said yes 
goddamn it  randy s mom doesn t
work  and his dad didn t leave her 
figuring out who
takes him to roller hockey   
   is probably easier at
randy s house  now cool it 
i ll be as quick as i can 
matthew  can you watch your sister 
 matthew 
 all right  fine  come here  beth

 thanks  i appreciate you coming over 
what 
our new partner 
when was i gonna hear about this 
just listen  did i ever tell
you about that airline case 
what the fuck are you talking about 
a few years back  i was
trying this airline case   
   and i got my ass kicked by this
guy  he buried me in paper  brutal 
he s the toughest
i d ever been up against 
make a point 
it was kurt potter 
after the judge s decision  i asked
him to partner  he didn t hesitate 
he wouldn t hesitate now  we did
all the work  where was he before 
will you listen to me 
it doesn t matter 
you wanna win this 
he gave me this check 
it covers all our expenses to date   
   and he s got more toxic
tort experience than anyone 
this is good news 
i got pamela duncan 
i ll open  mommy 
you wanna open the can for
mommy  well  here  i ll help you 
you turn it 
 hi  george 
 hi  george  let s go see 
erin brockovich 
package from masry and vititoe 
 thank you 
 thank you 
 what s in here 
 baby 
there s no baby in here 
 what is it 
 a dolly 
it s a dolly  it s   
lookit 
 lookit  is right 
do you see that 
 i want that 
 i want that too 
it s our lucky day 
matthew  katie 
pg e has requested that we
submit to binding arbitration 
what s that 
that s where we try the case
without a jury  before a judge 
it s called a test trial 
the judge s decision
is final  there s no appeal 
 how many plaintiffs do you have 
 634 
they ll never try
that many all at once 
so we need to get them together
in groups of 20 or 30 
worst cases  the most life threatened 
the sickest first and so on 
each one gets a go before
the judge to determine damages 
pg e proposes that they re liable   
   anywhere between
50 and 400 million 
so wait a minute  let
me just get this straight 
if we went to trial   
   pg e could stretch this over
10 years with appeal after appeal 
 those people would   
 these people expect a trial 
that s what we told them  you
and me  they won t understand this 
kurt thinks it s the best way to go 
look  i promise you that we ll
be very sensitive on this point 
we ll make sure they see   
   that this is the only way
we can go forward at this time 
but we have a lot of work to do   
   before we even broach that subject 
i ll take erin down the hall   
   so we can start on this stuff 
and i ll fill her in on the details 
 those are my files 
 yeah  we had them couriered over 
listen  good work 
they re a great start 
we ll just spend some time
filling in the holes in your research 
excuse me    theresa  is it 
there are no holes in my research 
there are things we need
you probably didn t know to ask 
don t talk to me like i m an idiot 
i spent 18 months on this case   
   and i know more about
the plaintiffs than you ever will 
you don t even have phone numbers 
whose number do you need 
everyone s  we need to be
able to contact the plaintiffs 
i said whose number do you need 
you don t know 600 numbers by heart 
annabelle daniels

you want their diseases 
i think we got off on the wrong foot 
that s all you got  lady  two
wrong feet in fucking ugly shoes 
 she insulted me 
 bullshit  it was a misunderstanding 
instead of being polite and
treating her with respect   
why should i respect her 
just because she s not supporting kids
with no husband  she s not an idiot 
just because she
dresses like a lawyer   
   doesn t mean she didn t
work her ass off in law school 
excuse me for not going to law school 
law school  at this point 
i d settle for charm school 
mr  linwood 
bob 
6086 ridge road   
   hinkley  california  714   
   455   
okay  now  if you
could walk me through   
   all of the elements
of annabelle s illnesses 
specific details   
   when the symptoms began 
prior to the first medical visit 
if you could reserve sentimental
embellishments  i d appreciate it   
   because they won t
help you in court 
i just need facts  dates  time 
  know theresa isn t real
warm  but she s a good lawyer 
she asks the same questions
you did    told you everything 
  don t want her coming to the
house again  she upsets annabelle 
okay  if you don t like
theresa  that s okay 
you know how important
annabelle is to me 
ed and i are still here for you 
i called ed two days ago  erin 
he still hasn t called me back 
now  i hate to say this  but   
   everyone s upset
about this arbitration thing 
what 
pamela has written a letter   
   telling everybody
to get new lawyers 
that we ve been lied to 
  s it true 
 no 
did you 
i m telling you the truth  and
i ll get to the bottom of all of this 
don t lie to us 
i will take care of this 
 now  we re trusting you here  so   
 thanks 
i ll talk to you soon  okay 
i m not saying
it s not a strong case 
otherwise  they wouldn t have dropped
the demurrers  i wouldn t be here 
what i am saying is  we
don t have a smoking gun   
   that ties san francisco to hinkley 
something that
proves that prior to 1987   
   pg e corporate knew the water was
bad there and did nothing about it 
 erin  i thought you took a sick day 
 so did i 
 what s going on in there 
 meeting about the pg e thing 
 are you sure 
 yep 
we can find it  or
we don t have a big win 
can i take a brief
break here for a moment 
i ll be right back 
 you told me you weren t feeling great 
 bullshit 
if i was on my deathbed  if it
helped you  you d drag me out of it 
how could you take this away from me 
 nobody s taking anything 
 bullshit  you stuck me in siberia 
dictating to some goddamned clerk
so you could finish this without me 
they screwed up  erin 
they screwed up and they admit it 
the arbitration proposal   
   could ve been written in sanskrit 
for all the sense it made 
i know  i spoke to ted  pamela duncan
wouldn t even get on the phone with me 
pamela made everybody
mad with that letter 
she called us thieves 
 the whole thing s falling apart 
 why 
because before we go to arbitration 
the plaintiffs must agree 
 how many 
 usually they require about 70  
pg e is demanding 90 
in other words  everybody 
do you understand  this is serious 
and  what  ed  i m not serious 
you re emotional  you re erratic 
you say anything  you make
this personal  and it isn t 
not personal 
that is my work 
my sweat  my time away from my kids 
if that s not personal 
i don t know what is 
hey  come on 
come on 
go home  get well 
because you re no good to me sick 
i need you  all right 
this case needs you 
did you tell them that 
binding arbitration isn t
that different from a trial 
it s overseen by a judge  evidence
is presented in much the same way 
and then a jury decides 
sorry  i forgot to mention that
there s no jury in binding arbitration 
no jury and no appeal 
what option do we have if
we don t like the result 
none  the judge s decision is final 
not a good answer 
no  but we don t
anticipate that being a problem 
as i already told you   
   it s definitely between
50 and 400 000 000 dollars 
well  which 
there s a big difference 
i wouldn t like to speculate 
 well  how does it get divided 
 yeah  who gets what 
my medical bills started two years ago 
before some of the other people here 
my daughter was in and out
of hospitals more than his 
it shouldn t matter when it started 
people  listen  please 
the point we have to address
tonight is getting everyone to agree   
   that binding arbitration
is better than a trial   
   that could go on for
10 years before you see any money 
maybe some of us
wanna wait 10 years 
everyone has to agree 
or no one has a chance 
those of you about to leave  i d like
you to keep this date in mind  1978 
that s the year of
the love canal controversy 
they re still
waiting for their money 
think about where
you ll be in 15 or 20 years 
now  look  everyone 
is this a big decision 
absolutely  but i do not
believe this is a sell out 
this is the best shot
to get everyone some money now 
you and i both know   
   there are people in this
room who can t afford to wait 
to take that chance 
are you gonna make them wait 
so how many altogether 
we got just about everybody that came
here  but it leaves us about 150 short 
oh  shit 
we ll have to go door to door 
i gotta go pick up my kids 
 you need a hand with that 
 no 
you did good 
we ll see 
thanks for coming 
don t take them anywhere on your
bike  i ll give you money for a cab 
i got money 
so how long is this gonna take 
i don t know  a few days 
got your own room 
i am really sorry  george

and it d be soaked in red
from the nosebleeds 
i was working in the compressor 
the supervisor calls me
up to the office and says 
 we ll give you a shredder   
   and send you to the warehouse
to shred the documents we stored  
he say why 
nope  and i didn t ask 
did you look at the stuff
you destroyed 
it was a lot of dull
vacation schedules and stuff 
then there were memos about
the holding ponds  the water in them 
and readings from the test wells 
stuff like that 
you were told to destroy those 
that s right 
course  as it turns out   
   i wasn t a very good employee 
 good morning 
 morning 
ed  erin  what s this 
 may i 
 yep  go ahead 
well  you know what  mr  potter 
we completely forgot
your birthday this year 
seeing as how you ve been so good
to me  it s a terrible oversight 
so ed and i have been putting together
a present for you 
six hundred and thirty four 
they re signed  every one 
holy shit 
now  don t go
getting jealous  theresa 
we have something for you 
internal pg e documents 
all about the contamination 
the one i like best says   
   l m paraphrasing here  but it says 
 the water s poisonous   
   but it s best if this wasn t
discussed with the neighbours  
it s to hinkley
from pg e headquarters 
stamp received march 1966 
how did you do this 
seeing as how i have no
brains or legal expertise   
   and ed was losing all faith 
completely  no faith 
i went out there and performed sexual
favours  634 blowjobs in five days 
i m really quite tired 
oh  thank you 
why did you want me to come 
i wanna show you
what you helped to do 
 how are you feeling today 
 good 
 it s a good day 
 oh  i m glad 
well  come on in 
what a nice surprise this is 
donna 
i wanted to come out here
instead of calling   
   because the judge
came back with a number 
for the whole group  or for us 
both 
he s gonna make them pay 333 million 
 and   
 oh  my god 
he s gonna make them give
5 million of that to your family 
five million dollars 
five million dollars 
i don t even know
how much money that is 
well  it s enough  it s enough
for whatever you could ever need   
   or what your girls need  or your
girls  girls  it ll be enough 
oh  erin  oh  god 
thank you so much 
it s okay 
i don t know what i d have done
without you 
it s a good day 
this is too much 
masry and vititoe  can l    
shoot 
delivery for ed masry 
last office down the corridor 
on the right 
thank you 
masry and vititoe   
damn it 
does anyone know anything
about these phones 
everybody loves the desk   
   you picked out for me 
it s great 
guess who s on the cover
of los angeles lawyer magazine 
talk to you later  baby  bye 
 thank you 
 you re welcome 
i d rather walk her through this
in person  to show her   
   visual aids  documents and stuff 
tell her i won t take up
too much of her time 
it s a little more complicated
than hinkley  so let me do that 
say i m not a lawyer 
that may help 
great 
why don t you give me the address now 
just in case 
all right  thanks so much  bye 
what s up 
i have your bonus check 
i want you to be prepared 
the figure s not exactly
what we discussed 
why not 
because  after careful consideration 
i felt   
   that figure was not appropriate 
although you may not agree   
   you have to trust my   
trust  you want me to trust you 
don t use big words
you don t understand 
 it s a complicated issue   
 i did a job 
you should reward me accordingly 
it s not complicated 
all you lawyers do is complicate
situations that aren t complicated 
do you know why people think
lawyers are scumbags 
because they are  i can t believe
you re doing this to me   
   when i m up to my ass
in kettleman plaintiffs   
   which looks to be
double the amount of hinkley 
you expect me to leave my kids
with strangers  knock on doors   
   get these people to trust you 
and you re screwing me 
i want you to know 
it s not about the number 
it is about the way
my work is valued 
no matter what i do  you re not   
as i was saying   
   i decided that the figure
you proposed   
   was inappropriate
