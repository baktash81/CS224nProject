i dont have a job now

i dont mind taking you up on that
why do you want to watch my kids
i like kids

i like hanging out with them
they keep it simple
youre home every afternoon
im usually working on my bike
if it doesnt work out you can always
send them back to the chickenfat lady
this isnt gonna get you laid
get in bed
good because i dont
find you attractive either
then were even
im so glad we got that
out of the way
i feel much better
i do too because now i can
just look after the kids
and i dont have to worry
about you coming on to me
bring the phone into the changing room
of course they wont
mrs masry dont be such a tease
hold on just hold on yeah
sorry would you mind
if i investigate this

this realestate thing

yeah yeah sure
you dont mind
okay great thanks
donna jensen
im erin brockovich
with masry and vititoe
oh youre a lawyer
hell no i hate lawyers
i just work for em
do you have a minute
i dont mean to be a pain to pge
after all theyve done for hinkley
but if they want this place
theyre gonna have to pay for it
you didnt put the house up for sale
they just wanted to buy it
oh yeah yeah
oh i dont wanna move
uproot the kids
ive got a couple of girls
honest to god i dont know
if i have the energy
you know ive been sick
me and pete both have
the idea of selling if theyre
not gonna pay us properly
i dont see the point
yeah yeah i can see that
i guess the only thing
that confused me
not that your medical problems
arent important
how come those files are in
with all the realestate stuff
theres just so much correspondence
i just keep it all in one place
im sorry i just dont see why youre
corresponding with pge
about your medical problems
in the first place
well they paid
for the doctors visit
they did
you bet paid for a checkup
for the whole family
not like with insurance where you pay
and maybe you see some money in a year
they just took care of it
just like that
we never saw a bill
wow whyd they do that
the chromium
the what
the chromium
well thats what
kicked this whole thing off
what kind of chromium
theres more than one
theres straightup chromium
it does good things for the body
theres chrom three
which is fairly benign
theres chrom six
hexavalent chromium
which depending on the amounts
can be harmful
harmful how what would you get
with repeated exposure
to toxic levels anything
from chronic headaches to respiratory
disease liver failure
heart failure reproductive failure
bone or organ deterioration
plus of course any type of cancer
so that stuff it kills people
yeah definitely
highly toxic highly carcinogenic
it gets into your dna so you pass
the trouble to your kids very bad
well whats it used for
a rust inhibitor
the utility plants use piston engines
that get hot they run water through
chromiums in the water
to prevent corrosion
how do i find out what kind
of chromium they use in hinkley
been to their water board
whats that
every county has one
they keep records of anything
in their jurisdiction
you should find something there
county water board
alrighty well thanks
good luck
i wouldnt advertise
what youre looking for
incriminating records have a way of
disappearing when people smell trouble
ill remember that thanks
this guys too smart
ts only a matter of time
until he makes his move
he positions women employees
in such a way
that they have no choice
but to respond or lose theirjobs
thats a heavy door
let me give you a hand
thank you very much arent you
a gentleman mr
scott
mr scott
pleased to meet you
im erin
erin erin cool
what can i do for you erin

i guess i did
just tell me what you wanna look at
and id be glad to dig em out
i wish i knew its for my boss
hes in this water dispute
and he wants me to find all kinds
of papers from all kinds of places

do something important with my life
that it meant i was someone
youre someone to me

that i have to survive
because ill tell you the truth
lm not up to it
i get up in the centre of the stage
and i have the big
bouquet of flowers
i had my foot out like this
and i said
i will devote my entire reign
as miss wichita
to bringing an end to world hunger
and to the creation
of a peaceful earth
for every man woman and child
how long were you miss wichita

by the time i got through
opening new supermarkets

let me tell you something
let me get that out of your hair
thank you
nice
youre a very special lady
dont be too nice to me okay
why
makes me nervous
its some slim pickings here baby
maybe thats ed mcmahon
lets go see
wrong ed
what are you doing here
i had an interesting call
this afternoon from dr frankel
from ucla
oh yeah
he wanted you to know that the  legal
limit for hexavalent chromium
is05 parts per million
and at the rate you mentioned
58 it could be
responsible for the cancers
in that family you asked about
the jensens
well wasnt that nice of him
funny how some people help people
and others just fire them
im sorry you were gone
i assumed you were off having fun
why the hell would you assume that
maybe you look like someone
who has a lot of fun
by that standard
i assume you never get laid
im married
look what is this whats the story
on this cancer stuff
you wanna know you have to hire me
back i got a ton of bills to pay
fine
fine
donna just put in these new cabinets
stained the wood and all
when she gets a call from pge
saying a freeways gonna be built
and they wanna buy her house
for an offramp
the husbands sick with hodgkins
she keeps getting tumours
believing one has nothing
to do with the other
because pge told her
about the chromium
they had a seminar
they invited 200 people
from the area
had it at the plant
about chromium three
and how good it is
when theyre using chromium six
that document you found
at the water board
the one that says
about the bad chromium
you didnt happen to make a copy
did you
of course i did
could i have a look
i want a raise
and benefits including dental
its not how i do business
what way is that
extortion
a 5 raise well talk
about benefits later
ten there are lots of other places
i could get work
10 raise and benefits but thats it
im drawing the line
hes drawing the line
this the only thing you got
well the place is a pigsty
theres probably more
i know how those things are run
what makes you think
you can just walk in there
and find what we need
theyre called boobs ed
yes im sure it is
i understand
i agree i agree im going to
right now
im almost done look
how are we doing
were doing great
good
well youve got quite a lot
done already so
sorry we need to have
those records back now
no
these papers are public record
im not leaving
until theyre copied
fax these to this number okay
all of them
all of them
an onsite monitoring well
that means it was
its on the pge property
and you say that this stuff
this hexavalent chromium
well its poisonous
yeah
its gotta be different than whats
in our water because ours is okay
the guys from pge told me
they sat right in the kitchen
and told me that it was fine
i know but the toxicologist
that ive been talking to
he gave me a list of problems that
come from hexavalent chromium exposure
everything you all have
is on that list
no no no
thats not what
thats not what our doctor said
he said that
well that ones got absolutely
nothing to do with the other
but pge paid for that doctor
ashley
shanna
get out of the pool
how come
i said so thats why
the minute brenda sent that fax
lm saying the second she
pressed the send button
pges claim department
was on the phone to me
scheduling a meeting
so you think that
let me do it
youre driving me nuts
you think we scared them
taking the trouble to send someone
sounds like theyre
sitting up and taking notice
mr foil
in the interest
of putting this to rest
pge is willing to offer
the jensens 250000 for their home
in terms of land value in hinkley
we feel thats a more
than fair price
how about in terms
of medical expenses
250000 isnt gonna come close to what
this familys gonna spend on doctors
i understand theyve had bad luck
healthwise
they have my sympathies
but thats not pges fault
youre kidding right
look at these readings
pges own technicians documented
toxic levels of hexavalent chromium
in those wells
on numerous occasions
everything the jensens have had
is proven reaction to exposure to
hexavalent chromium they have had
they have had
breast cysts uterine cancer
hodgkins immune deficiencies
asthma nosebleeds
a million things could
cause those problems
poor diet bad genes
irresponsible lifestyle
our offer is final
and more than fair
wait a minute
i thought we were negotiating here
250000 is all
im authorized to offer
ill present your offer to my clients
i doubt theyll accept
before you go off on a crusade
remember who youre dealing with
pges a 28 billion
dollar corporation
28 billion dollars
i didnt know it was that much
wow twentyeight billion
holy cow
they made an offer
no a million would have been
an offer they send that
mail clerk down to jerk me off
waste my time
why
you heard what that kid said
they have 28 billion dollars
they can afford to waste time
you cant
am i made of money
why are you yelling
im pissed
fuck you
fuck you back
i really hate you sometimes
no you love me
youve been reading for hours
im a slow reader
excuse me
are you erin brockovich
yeah
im tom robinson
this is my wife mandy
we used to live across
the street from the jensens
i think you know donna
pge bought our house last year
well the vet said they had
a bunch of tumours and stuff
well you can see
they couldnt really walk
how many were born like this
twelve or 13 or so
when donna told us what
you told her about the chromium
we figured it might have
something to do with this
yeah it might
really may i keep these
yeah
okay great
thank you so much
i really appreciate it
theres something else too
what
mandy here has had
five miscarriages
im so sorry
i figured it was something i did
like when i smoked marijuana
maybe
or took birth control pills
but then donna
said that you thought
this chromium might be
to blame for her problems
so i figured maybe
it wasnt just me
i have to take a bath
you should go in
theyre not asleep
beth and katie are
how was school
fine
did you do your homework
yeah
any problems
i know youre upset
but the way this job is
things come up at the last minute
things that i gotta deal with
fine
please dont be mad at me
im doing this for us i know
its hard for you to understand
but dont you want mommy
to be good at her job
i dont miss dinner all the time
we all ate together last night
you were reading the whole time
theres something about this thing
i dont understand mr masry
if pge messed with our water
why would they say anything
about it to us at all
why not just keep quiet about it
to establish a statute of limitations
in a case like this
you only have one year
from the time you learn about
the problem to file suit
so pge figures
well let the cat out of the bag
tell them the water isnt perfect
if we can ride out the year
with no one suing
well be in the clear forever
but they told us more than a year ago
thats okay were not suing
not yet
all were doing
is using this information
to get you a nice purchase
price on your house
and you two a comparable
retroactive bonus on your sale price
pge still looks good
to their shareholders
theyre not in a lawsuit
all theyre doing is buying property
doesnt say how much
this things gonna cost us
my fee is 40 of whatever
you get awarded
boy do i know how you feel
the first time i heard that number
i said youre kidding me
forty goddamned percent
im the one thats injured and
this joker sits at a desk all day
and he wants
almost half of my reward
erin can l
but then
i asked him
what he makes
if i dont get anything
then i dont get anything either
plus hes out all the costs
so i realized
hes taking a chance too
you got a pen honey
all right then
oh i made a bundt cake
who would like coffee and cake
i do
thanks but we have to get back
have a fucking cup of coffee ed
coffee will be great thank you
all right
ill help you
my wife makes really good bundt cake
i love bundt cake
well it seems like everybody in
the family ended up with a rash somehow
it seemed like no matter what
we did it always came back
over what kind of period of time
oh long time you know years
i never did keep track of it
kids are sick
animals need to be fed
just couldnt get rid of it
well mrs de soto said
that she wasnt
exactly sure what you had
we know what it is
its gastrointestinal
gastrointestinal cancer
she got sick about nine months ago
nine months ago
and they operated on her
about six months ago
the intestine
right
hi im erin brock
i know who you are
donna called me
can i come in
were not interested
in getting involved
can i ask why
whats the point
donna told me that youve been sick
and that your kids were sick
you people dont give a shit
anything to get what you want
thanks for having me
its a good day to come by
shes feeling good
well mike ambrosino had remembered
that he had seen
you folks at the hospital
thats what brought me out here
yeah weve been there
from time to time
and you wooftie
aint you a beauty
you drive all the boys
crazy dont you
i can see it in your eyes
you drive them wild
you do dont you
torture them
its good for them
dont teach her anything too early
yeah she cant wait
to get on her new dress
she wants to go to school
were trying to do that
in a few months
yeah get her out
of her nightgown here
shes gonna do it
absolutely not
why not
because i said no
the reason pge even talks to us
is because this is a quiet
realestate dispute
we add plaintiffs were in
the middle of a toxictrot
with a statute problem
against a massive utility
no thank you
okay so heres what ill do
ill go to the daniels
the nicest people youll ever meet
who watch their girl fight
like a dog against cancer
ill tell them
we cant help them because you
just dont wanna work that hard
work hard
let me tell you something
ive worked all my life
ive built a firm and kept it alive
through lawsuits and injunctions
ive survived
a quadruple bypass cancer
being born with one
kidney and diabetes
i personally managed
to save a million dollars
over 30 years getting
clients 10 times that
dont tell me i dont work hard
dont tell me i cant stop
take a breath and enjoy life
what the hell do you know
about any of this
something like this erin
it could take forever
theyre a huge corporation
theyll bury us
in paperwork for years
im just a guy with
a small private firm
who knows they poisoned
people and lied about it
we can get these people
with a little effort i think we
can nail their asses to the wall
with your legal expertise
you believe that
dont you ever just know
do you know about money
they settle due to lack of money
you know what toxicologists
and geology experts cost
were looking at 100000 a month
ive already spent some of my savings
well figure it out
i dont know shit but i know the
difference between right and wrong
lovers quarrel
bite my ass krispy kreme
i feel you looking at me
im sorry
how many families are we talking about
four more eleven people so far
theres more
i found a document at the water board
a toxic test well reading from 1967
more people have lived
there since then
this is a whole different ball game
a much bigger deal
kind of like david
and whatshisname
kind of like david and whats
hisnames whole fucking family
heres the deal
lf and only if you find all the
evidence to back this up ill do it
youre doing the right thing
remind me of that when
im filing for bankruptcy
of course gathering
evidence is a big job
hell of a lot bigger than just filing
ill be working a lot harder
taking on a lot
more responsibility
i dont believe this
a raise wouldnt hurt
ill spend more time in my car
so ill probably be needing
one of those cell phones

at a ball and said
ball
out of the blue like that
t was pretty intense
you know seeing
somebodys first word
of all the words in her life
thats the first word she says ball
she pointed her little finger
with her beautiful soft
chubby little arm
and her cheeks
ts like shed been
looking at it for months
and couldnt get it out
but knowing what it was
she didnt look away or anything
she was just sitting
there with her arm out
you shouldve seen
matthew and katie and me

four minutes andjust looked at her

thanks so much

information than that in there
im bored
so are the kids
im a little busy honey
we invited these people
ed and i have to
im sorry you know what
please i have an idea
can you take her
shes getting heavy and ill
work faster if you take her
got a knee for me
hello
hello sweetness
guess what
what
i would like to go home
everythings done
we got a lot done
did you i think
i ate three watermelons
piggyback
lets go brother get on
careful
here get on me now
erin excuse me
this is nelson perez he works
at the compressor station
hi nice to meet you
pge
oh hi
ive come at a bad time
no
can you just give me one
of course sure
thank you
you know what
why dont you guys go ahead without
me and ill get a ride with ed
no mom
no sweetie ill be right behind you
ill be right behind you all right
i really this is so
fine go go go
get down bud
hang on tight there
help your sister
with her shoes lets go
this is so helpful
is it okay if i write this down
i have so many questions
i wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers just everything
i wanna know about how the plant works
and the cooling towers just everything
they use the hexachrome here in these
cooling towers as an anticorrosive
then they dump the excess
water into these ponds
i dont remember seeing
any ponds up there
theyve been covered over
and not too carefully
if you dig one inch
under the surface
dirts as green
as a fucking shamrock
and thats what
caused the contamination
it didnt help but no
the problem started on the bottom
according to
this
in most cases you would
line these ponds
so the shit didnt seep
into the ground
but guess what
they skipped that step
here are the ponds
the plume comes down
and hinkley is down here
its 14 years of hexachrome
flowing into the groundwater
jesus
this guy just offered
all this information
well yeah nelson cares
whats in those ponds
he used to spend time wading
around them that was his job
shit
whats the matter
i dont know if we can pull this off
this is a monster case
were up to 411 plaintiffs
weve taken 162 declarations
probably hundreds more
out there have moved away
we have to find them
its taking time
moneys going out
nothings coming in
i have to take a second mortgage
so
so
i have to tell you
ive been making inquiries
with other firms
bigger firms to share
some of the cost
they all said no
said they dont have it
we got pge by the balls
pge hinkley but nobodyll get rich
unless we pin this on corporate
in san francisco
what do you mean
pge corporate claims they
didnt know about hinkley
they knew they had to know
show me the document to prove it
then they didnt know if so we
cant hit them with punitive damages
with punitive damages
its a sum of money that can
have some effect
on these peoples lives
so what do we do now
lets assume there are documents
connecting pge hinkley and corporate
and they know about them
we take our 400 or so plaintiffs
and everything youve dug up
we file a lawsuit
to provoke a reaction
see if they offer a reasonable
settlement or throw more paper at us
sounds great lets do that
theres a downside
pge will submit a demurrer
a list attacking each complaint
claiming that each cause
of action has no merit
and if the judge agrees with them
hell dismiss our case
pge will have no reason to settle
then its all over
so basically it all comes down to
what this one judge decides
basically yeah
jesus
well id got so used
to having them come up benign
guess i just didnt expect it
i sure wish i wouldve had longer
to get used to the idea
you think if you got no uterus
and no breasts
youre still technically a woman
sure you are
yeah you just
youre actually a happier woman
no need to worry
about maxipads and underwire
were gonna get them arent we
you gotta promise me
that were gonna get them
have before me
a complaint on behalf of residents
of hinkley california who
have filed against pge
for damages medical expenses
and personal trauma
due to contamination of the ground
water in their area by the defendant
and i have here 84 motions
to strike and demurrers
submitted by representatives
of pacific gas  electric
each one attacking
the validity of this complaint
i have reviewed all of
the information carefully
im ready to give my decision
before i do is there
anything anyone wants to say
no your honour
no your honour
very well
in the matter of the plaintiffs
of hinkley california vs pge
it is the order of this court that
each of the 84 motions to strike
and demurrers are denied
and the causes of action against
pacific gas and electric are upheld
on a more personal note
as a resident here in barstow
which is not far from hinkley
i am disturbed by reference
to evidence that suggests that not
only was hexavalent chromium used
but that your clients
actually sent these residents
pamphlets telling them
that it was good for them
tell your clients
theyre going to trial
jesus they look
like the secret service
intimidation
let the games begin
show them into the conference room
donald anna
i wanna talk to you for a minute
counsellors
counsellors
lets be honest
20000000 is more than
these people have ever dreamed of
now that pisses me off
first of all since the demurrer
we have more than 400 plaintiffs
lets be honest we know theres more
they may not be sophisticated
but they can divide
and 20000000
isnt shit after splitting it
second of all
they dont dream of being rich
they dream about
watching their kids in a pool
without worrying that
theyll have a hysterectomy at 20
like rosa diaz our client
or have their spine deteriorate like
stan bloom another client of ours
so before you come back here
with another lameass offer
i want you to think real
hard about what your spine is worth
or what you expect someone
to pay you for your uterus
then take out your calculator
and multiply that number by 100
anything less than that
is a waste of our time
we had that water brought
in special for you folks
came from hinkley
i think this meetings over
damn right it is
what the fuck did a bomb blow up
you letting the kids run wild
whats that
i saw them in a mall one day
i said  damn
theyll look good on
those beautiful ears
i bought them and i said when erin
does something nice ill surprise her
you know how long ago that was
six months ago
im sorry ive just
and so what im thinking is
either you gotta find
a different job or a different guy
i mean
there may be many men out there
who dont mind being the maid
and getting nothing
but i aint one of them
i cant leave my job george
yes you can
people do it all the time
how can you ask me to do that
this job
for the first time in my
life i got people respecting me
up in hinkley
i walk into a room everybody shuts
up to hear what i have to say
i never had that before ever
please dont ask me to give it up
what about your kids
im doing more for them now
than i did living with my parents
one day theyll see it
well what about me
what about you
you think the men
who gave me those children
asked me what i
wanted before walking away
all ive ever done
is bend my life around
what men decide they need
well not now
im sorry i wont do it
well
erin im not them so
what more can i do
to prove that to you
stay
what for
i mean you got a raise
you can afford daycare
you dont need me
hi
we can get them pamela
we can
i dont wanna feel it all over again
and then not have it come out right
i dont know if i could handle that
put the kids through that
the thing is it doesnt matter
whether you win lose or draw here
you were lied to youre sick and your
kids are sick because of those lies
you all have to come together
to stand up in
a courtroom and say that
id bring the kids
into the hospital
with towels soaked
from their nosebleeds
they called county services because
they assumed the kids were abused
am i gonna get the best
behaviour in the office
no
whats with the attitude
i just need cool i need quiet
hello am i alone in the car yes
i dont understand why
i dont wanna talk about it now
the other moms gave permission
i dont care
so when can i get a friggin answer
dont talk to me like that
randys mom said yes
goddamn it randys mom doesnt
work and his dad didnt leave her
figuring out who
takes him to roller hockey
is probably easier at
randys house now cool it
ill be as quick as i can
matthew can you watch your sister
matthew
all right fine come here beth
can i come with you
no baby ill just be a second
thank you im only
sorry you couldnt meet erin

we have a lot of work to do together
thanks for coming

hell handle hinkley
i see what you mean
about a secret weapon
erin its great to meet you
youve done a fabulous job
ill be seeing you
thanks i appreciate you coming over
what
our new partner
when was i gonna hear about this
just listen did i ever tell
you about that airline case
what the fuck are you talking about
a few years back i was
trying this airline case
and i got my ass kicked by this
guy he buried me in paper brutal
hes the toughest
id ever been up against
make a point
it was kurt potter
after the judges decision i asked
him to partner he didnt hesitate
he wouldnt hesitate now we did
all the work where was he before
will you listen to me
it doesnt matter
you wanna win this
he gave me this check
it covers all our expenses to date
and hes got more toxic
tort experience than anyone
this is good news
i got pamela duncan
ill open mommy
you wanna open the can for
mommy well here ill help you
you turn it
hi george
hi george lets go see
erin brockovich
package from masry and vititoe
thank you
thank you
whats in here
baby
theres no baby in here
what is it
a dolly
its a dolly its
lookit
lookit is right
do you see that
i want that
i want that too
its our lucky day
matthew katie
pge has requested that we
submit to binding arbitration
whats that
thats where we try the case
without a jury before a judge
its called a test trial
the judges decision
is final theres no appeal
how many plaintiffs do you have
theyll never try
that many all at once
so we need to get them together
in groups of 20 or 30
worst cases the most lifethreatened
the sickest first and so on
each one gets a go before
the judge to determine damages
pge proposes that theyre liable
anywhere between
50 and 400 million
so wait a minute let
me just get this straight
if we went to trial
pge could stretch this over
10 years with appeal after appeal
those people would
these people expect a trial
thats what we told them you
and me they wont understand this
kurt thinks its the best way to go
look i promise you that well
be very sensitive on this point
well make sure they see
that this is the only way
we can go forward at this time
but we have a lot of work to do
before we even broach that subject
ill take erin down the hall
so we can start on this stuff
and ill fill her in on the details
those are my files
yeah we had them couriered over
listen good work
theyre a great start
well just spend some time
filling in the holes in your research
excuse me theresa is it
there are no holes in my research
there are things we need
you probably didnt know to ask
dont talk to me like im an idiot
i spent 18 months on this case
and i know more about
the plaintiffs than you ever will
you dont even have phone numbers
whose number do you need
everyones we need to be
able to contact the plaintiffs
i said whose number do you need
you dont know 600 numbers by heart
annabelle daniels
annabelle daniels 7144549346
ten years old lived
on the plume since birth
wanted to be a synchronized swimmer
so she spent every minute in the pool
they detected a tumour in her brain
an operation shrunk it
with radiation after that
her parents are ted and rita
teds got crohns disease rita has
headaches and underwent a hysterectomy
ted grew up in hinkley his
brother and his wife and their kids
robbie jr martha ed rose
and peter also lived on the plume
their number is 4549554
you want their diseases
i think we got off on the wrong foot
thats all you got lady two
wrong feet in fucking ugly shoes
she insulted me
bullshit it was a misunderstanding
instead of being polite and
treating her with respect
why should i respect her
just because shes not supporting kids
with no husband shes not an idiot
just because she
dresses like a lawyer
doesnt mean she didnt
work her ass off in law school
excuse me for not going to law school
law school at this point
id settle for charm school
mr linwood
bob
6086 ridge road
hinkley california 714
okay now if you
could walk me through
all of the elements
of annabelles illnesses
specific details
when the symptoms began
prior to the first medical visit
if you could reserve sentimental
embellishments id appreciate it
because they wont
help you in court
i just need facts dates time
know theresa isnt real
warm but shes a good lawyer
she asks the same questions
you did  told you everything
dont want her coming to the
house again she upsets annabelle
okay if you dont like
theresa thats okay
you know how important
annabelle is to me
ed and i are still here for you
i called ed two days ago erin
he still hasnt called me back
now i hate to say this but
everyones upset
about this arbitration thing
what
pamela has written a letter
telling everybody
to get new lawyers
that weve been lied to
s it true
no
did you
im telling you the truth and
ill get to the bottom of all of this
dont lie to us
i will take care of this
now were trusting you here so
thanks
ill talk to you soon okay
im not saying
its not a strong case
otherwise they wouldnt have dropped
the demurrers i wouldnt be here
what i am saying is we
dont have a smoking gun
that ties san francisco to hinkley
something that
proves that prior to 1987
pge corporate knew the water was
bad there and did nothing about it
erin i thought you took a sick day
so did i
whats going on in there
meeting about the pge thing
are you sure
yep
we can find it or
we dont have a big win
can i take a brief
break here for a moment
ill be right back
you told me you werent feeling great
bullshit
if i was on my deathbed if it
helped you youd drag me out of it
how could you take this away from me
nobodys taking anything
bullshit you stuck me in siberia
dictating to some goddamned clerk
so you could finish this without me
they screwed up erin
they screwed up and they admit it
the arbitration proposal
couldve been written in sanskrit
for all the sense it made
i know i spoke to ted pamela duncan
wouldnt even get on the phone with me
pamela made everybody
mad with that letter
she called us thieves
the whole things falling apart
why
because before we go to arbitration
the plaintiffs must agree
how many
usually they require about 70
pge is demanding 90
in other words everybody
do you understand this is serious
and what ed im not serious
youre emotional youre erratic
you say anything you make
this personal and it isnt
not personal
that is my work
my sweat my time away from my kids
if thats not personal
i dont know what is
hey come on
come on
go home get well
because youre no good to me sick
i need you all right
this case needs you
did you tell them that
binding arbitration isnt
that different from a trial
its overseen by a judge evidence
is presented in much the same way
and then a jury decides
sorry i forgot to mention that
theres no jury in binding arbitration
no jury and no appeal
what option do we have if
we dont like the result
none the judges decision is final
not a good answer
no but we dont
anticipate that being a problem
as i already told you
its definitely between
50 and 400000000 dollars
well which
theres a big difference
i wouldnt like to speculate
well how does it get divided
yeah who gets what
my medical bills started two years ago
before some of the other people here
my daughter was in and out
of hospitals more than his
it shouldnt matter when it started
people listen please
the point we have to address
tonight is getting everyone to agree
that binding arbitration
is better than a trial
that could go on for
10 years before you see any money
maybe some of us
wanna wait 10 years
everyone has to agree
or no one has a chance
those of you about to leave id like
you to keep this date in mind 1978
thats the year of
the love canal controversy
theyre still
waiting for their money
think about where
youll be in 15 or 20 years
now look everyone
is this a big decision
absolutely but i do not
believe this is a sellout
this is the best shot
to get everyone some money now
you and i both know
there are people in this
room who cant afford to wait
to take that chance
are you gonna make them wait
so how many altogether
we got just about everybody that came
here but it leaves us about 150 short
oh shit
well have to go doortodoor
i gotta go pick up my kids
you need a hand with that
no
you did good
well see

bike ill give you money for a cab

you were told to destroy those
thats right
course as it turns out
i wasnt a very good employee
good morning
morning
ed erin whats this
may i
yep go ahead
well you know what mr potter
we completely forgot
your birthday this year
seeing as how youve been so good
to me its a terrible oversight
so ed and i have been putting together
a present for you
sixhundred and thirtyfour
theyre signed every one
holy shit
now dont go
getting jealous theresa
we have something for you
internal pge documents
all about the contamination
the one i like best says
lm paraphrasing here but it says
the waters poisonous
but its best if this wasnt
discussed with the neighbours
its to hinkley
from pge headquarters
stamp received march 1966
how did you do this
seeing as how i have no
brains or legal expertise
and ed was losing all faith
completely no faith
i went out there and performed sexual
favours 634 blowjobs in five days
im really quite tired
oh thank you
why did you want me to come
i wanna show you
what you helped to do
how are you feeling today
good
its a good day
oh im glad
well come on in
what a nice surprise this is
donna
i wanted to come out here
instead of calling
because the judge
came back with a number
for the whole group or for us
both
hes gonna make them pay 333 million
and
oh my god
hes gonna make them give
5 million of that to your family
five million dollars
five million dollars
i dont even know
how much money that is
well its enough its enough
for whatever you could ever need
or what your girls need or your
girls girls itll be enough
oh erin oh god
thank you so much
its okay
i dont know what id have done
without you
its a good day
this is too much
masry and vititoe can l
shoot
delivery for ed masry
last office down the corridor
on the right
thank you
masry and vititoe
damn it
does anyone know anything
about these phones
everybody loves the desk
you picked out for me
its great
guess whos on the cover
of los angeles lawyer magazine
talk to you later baby bye
thank you
youre welcome
id rather walk her through this
in person to show her
visual aids documents and stuff
tell her i wont take up
too much of her time
its a little more complicated
than hinkley so let me do that
say im not a lawyer
that may help
great
why dont you give me the address now
just in case
all right thanks so much bye
whats up
i have your bonus check
i want you to be prepared
the figures not exactly
what we discussed
why not
because after careful consideration
i felt
that figure was not appropriate
although you may not agree
you have to trust my
trust you want me to trust you
dont use big words
you dont understand
its a complicated issue
i did a job
you should reward me accordingly
its not complicated
all you lawyers do is complicate
situations that arent complicated
do you know why people think
lawyers are scumbags
because they are i cant believe
youre doing this to me
when im up to my ass
in kettleman plaintiffs
which looks to be
double the amount of hinkley
you expect me to leave my kids
with strangers knock on doors
get these people to trust you
and youre screwing me
i want you to know
its not about the number
it is about the way
my work is valued
no matter what i do youre not
as i was saying
i decided that the figure
you proposed
was inappropriate
