theres business like show business
like business l know
everything appealing
everything traffic allow
nowhere could get happy feeling
stealing extra bow
theres people like show people
smile low
yesterday told would go far
night open
next day dressing room theyve hung star
les go show
costumes scenery makeup props
audience lifts youre
headaches heartaches backaches flops
sheriff escorts town
opening heart beats like drum
closing customers dont come
theres business like show business
like business l know
get word show started
favourite uncle died dawn
top pa parted
youre brokenhearted go
theres people like show people
smile low
even turkey know fold
may stranded cold
still wouldnt change sack gold
les go show
les go show
