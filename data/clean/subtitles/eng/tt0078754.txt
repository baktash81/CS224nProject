oh this l was just getting rid of it
l caught someone smoking
and l told him a man in my condition
shouldnt even be around smoke
lm telling ya gideon
l got real insight into you
theres a deeprooted fear
of being conventional
right
your blood pressure is higher than we hoped
your cardiograms havent improved one bit
now if you dont give a damn
is hard to expect us to
mr gideon
lll leave these menus with you please check
off what you want for the coming weeks ok
monday lll have roast beef
tuesday chicken wednesday steak
thursday l plan to be dead
so lll just have something light
mr gideon
she wrote a little note on the back
she said youd understand
dear loving giving generous
underlined four times  dad
l hear nurses are nice people hint hint
your poor brotherless daughter
joe what does it mean
lt means shes inherited her mothers
determination thas what it means
oh no thank you thank you no no
youre wonderful wonderful
the word superstar is greatly
overused in this business
but for my next guest the word
superstar is totally inadequate
whenever l do a benefit
and lve done 150 60 70 this year
all for very worthy causes  l can always
count on this dude to be right there with me
l feel humbled in his presence
from deep deep in here ladies
and gentlemen let me lay on you
a great entertainer
a great entertainer
a great humanitarian
a great humanitarian
and my dear friend for 25 years
and my dearest dearest friend for 20 years
you missed by five years
oh boy do l hate show business
joey you love show business
thas right l love show business
lll go either way
l got insight into you gideon
you know whas underneath
the dreadful fear that youre ordinary
not special
right
oh l think
l think
lm getting an erection
oh mr gideon dont do that
that sex thing jesus listen
l wouldnt say you were a faggot
but you do have a lot
of feminine characteristics right
right
you are foolishly and childishly
flirting with disaster
joey youre really crazy
what do you wanna do kill yourself
dr ballinger told me to get a little exercise
everything he does seems
to be a denial of his condition
dr ballinger every time lve seen him
l get the impression that
he doesnt care whether he lives or dies
yes l know but l think he cares a lot
ok well limit his visitors
to no more than two
joe l wish you could have been there
930 this morning
before a single review was out
the line at cinema one was around the
block the people know the people know
this broke every firstday record
ls a blockbuster l mean a blockbuster
and those guys in california
you wouldnt believe the telephone calls
congratulations they say were glad
you took your time lt was worth it
they said every dollar that we put
in that film is up there on the screen
lm telling you theyre talking about
a 35 million advertising budget
35 million dollars lm sorry excuse me
do you believe that 35 million dollars this
picture is gonna go right through the roof
right through the roof
look at those reviews see it
we did it joe we did it
where are the bad ones
there are no bad ones
josh
well there were a couple that
quibbled a little l left them at the office
josh l want you to do me a favour
dont show them to me
never how were the television reviews
l think we got leslie perry
at the screening she told me she loved it
following gideons triumphant directorial
achievement with 50 beautiful girls 50
when he won every possible award
it would be nice to report that
mr gideons latest effort the standup
starring davis newman was a better film
oh boy here it comes
joey turn it off please
falls into his characteristic weakness
of trying too hard to please to entertain
josh no l wanna hear it
the razzledazzle sometimes obliterates
what does she know
she never gives a good review
that woman is totally unqualified
to criticise anything
she doesnt know a damn thing about film
or anything
shes not even reviewing a film
shes telling you how clever she is
where the hasbeen comic
played impeccably by davis newman
demonstrates his former
brilliance in a monologue
where clearly director gideon
gave mr newman free rein
rising above rather commonplace material
the actor creates a classic comic
l guarantee this picture
will do 30 million domestic at least
one of you better get somebody
what
l think lm in trouble
chopping off the ends of scenes
before the drama is played out
left this reviewer with bewilderment
and a fouraspirin headache
using my fourballoon rating system
l give the standup haif a balloon
how are you feeling
the truth lm scared
roll em
action oh my god
ladies and gentlemen the doctors
lm dr hyman the internist
lm dr garry the surgeon
lm dr ballinger the cardiologist
five six seven eight
the heart is the viscus that maintains
the circulation of the blood
that means he had total blockage in
two arteries
this is the man who would be
my first choice as a modernday saint
when l was in those marches like selma
this brother was shufflin
right alongside me
long before those cats who thought
civil rights was a hip scene
and jumped on the blackwagon
the blackwagon oh ladies
and gentlemen let me lay on ya
a great entertainer
a great entertainer
a great humanitarian
a great humanitarian
and my dearest friend
and my dearest friend
blahblah
for 17 years
ladies and gentlemen

firstrate topdrawerjobs

yeah lm confused too do we
get all of that or part of it or what
simply here are the options
one if mr gideon recovers
and you resume production within the
180 days we are not liable for any part of it
two if mr gideon should die and you resume
production with another director
within the 180 days we are still not liable
three however if mr gideon
should expire before february 1
and you abandon production
we are liable for the full million dollars
this means gentlemen
you could make a profit of
you could be the first show on broadway
to make a profit without really opening

thank you wonderful wonderful
folks what can l tell you
about my next guest
this cat allowed himseif
to be adored but not loved
and his success in show business
was matched by failure
in his personalrelationship bag
now thas where he really bombed
and he came to believe that work
show business love his whole life
even himself and all thatjazz was bullshit
he became numero uno game player
to the point where he didnt know
where the games ended and reality began
like to this cat the only reality
is death man
ladies and gentlemen let me lay
on you a soso entertainer
not much of a humanitarian
and this cat was never nobodys friend
ln his final appearance on the great stage
of life  you can applaud if you wanna

theres no business like show business
like no business l know
everything about it is appealing
everything the traffic will allow
nowhere could you get that happy feeling
when you are stealing that extra bow
theres no people like show people
they smile when they are low
yesterday they told you
you would not go far
that night you open and there you are
next day on your dressing room
theyve hung a star
les go on with the show
the costumes the scenery
the makeup the props
the audience that lifts you
when youre down
the headaches the heartaches
the backaches the flops
the sheriff who escorts you out of town
the opening when your heart
beats like a drum
the closing when
the customers dont come
theres no business like show business
like no business l know
you get word before the show has started
that your favourite uncle died at dawn
on top of that your pa and ma have parted
youre brokenhearted but you go on
theres no people like show people
they smile when they are low
even with a turkey that you know has fold
you may be stranded out in the cold
but still you wouldnt change it
