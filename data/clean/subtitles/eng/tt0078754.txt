a cast like that together  l s really a shame 
and  of course  even after
four months  a heart attack   
there s no guarantee
that he ll be able to work 
none 
jules  i s still too bright

l s a seduction scene 
all right  take the shadow lights to half 
how much    is joe getting 
5  of the gross until payoff 
then he goes to 6  
20  of all subsidiary rights 
including a movie sale

and  generally  l find it 
well  it may take you years  but you ll find it 
oh  you re cute  you are cute

oh  this  l was just getting rid of it 
l caught someone smoking 
and l told him a man in my condition
shouldn t even be around smoke 
l m telling ya  gideon 
l got real insight into you 
there s a deep rooted fear
of being conventional 
right 
your blood pressure is higher than we hoped 
your cardiograms haven t improved one bit 
now  if you don t give a damn 
i s hard to expect us to 
mr gideon 
l ll leave these menus with you  please check
off what you want for the coming weeks  ok 
monday  l ll have roast beef 
tuesday  chicken  wednesday  steak 
thursday  l plan to be dead 
so    l ll just have something light 
mr gideon 
she wrote a little note on the back 
she said you d understand 
 dear loving  giving  generous   
underlined four times    dad 
l hear nurses are nice people  hint  hint 
your poor  brotherless daughter  
joe  what does it mean 
lt means she s inherited her mother s
determination  tha s what it means 
oh  no    thank you  thank you  no  no   
you re wonderful  wonderful 
the word superstar is greatly
overused in this business 
but for my next guest  the word
superstar is totally inadequate 
whenever l do a benefit 
and l ve done 150  60  70  this year 
all for very worthy causes   l can always
count on this dude to be right there with me 
l feel humbled in his presence 
from deep  deep in here  ladies
and gentlemen  let me lay on you   
  a great entertainer 
  a great entertainer 
  a great humanitarian 
  a great humanitarian 
  and my dear friend for 25 years 
  and my dearest  dearest friend for 20 years 
  you missed by five years 
  oh  boy  do l hate show business 
  joey  you love show business 
  tha s right  l love show business 
l ll go either way 
l got insight into you  gideon 
you know wha s underneath 
the dreadful fear that you re ordinary 
not special 
right 
oh  l think   
l think   
  l m getting an erection 
  oh  mr gideon  don t do that 
that sex thing  jesus  listen 
l wouldn t say you were a faggot 
but you do have a lot
of feminine characteristics  right 
right 
you are foolishly and childishly
flirting with disaster 
joey  you re really crazy 
what do you wanna do  kill yourself 
dr ballinger told me to get a little exercise 
everything he does seems
to be a denial of his condition 
dr ballinger  every time l ve seen him 
l get the impression that
he doesn t care whether he lives or dies 
yes  l know  but l think he cares a lot 
ok  we ll limit his visitors
to no more than two 
joe  l wish you could have been there 
9 30 this morning 
before a single review was out 
the line at cinema one was around the
block  the people know  the people know 
this broke every first day record 
l s a blockbuster  l mean a blockbuster 
and those guys in california   
you wouldn t believe the telephone calls 
 congratulations   they say   we re glad
you took your time  lt was worth it  
they said  every dollar that we put
in that film is up there on the screen  
l m telling you  they re talking about
a  3 5 million advertising budget 
3 5 million dollars  l m sorry  excuse me 
do you believe that  3 5 million dollars  this
picture is gonna go right through the roof 
right through    the roof 
look at those reviews  see it 
we did it  joe  we did it 
where are the bad ones 
there are no bad ones 
josh   
well  there were a couple that
quibbled a little  l left them at the office 
josh  l want you to do me a favour  
don t show them to me 
never  how were the television reviews 
l think we got leslie perry 
at the screening  she told me she loved it 
following gideon s triumphant directorial
achievement with  50 beautiful girls  50  
when he won every possible award 
it would be nice to report that
mr gideon s latest effort   the stand up  
starring davis newman  was a better film 
oh  boy  here it comes 
joey  turn it off  please 
    falls into his characteristic weakness
of trying too hard to please  to entertain 
  josh  no  l wanna hear it 
  the razzle dazzle sometimes obliterates   
  what does she know 
  she never gives a good review 
that woman is totally unqualified
to criticise anything 
  she doesn t know a damn thing about film 
  or anything 
she s not even reviewing a film 
she s telling you how clever she is 
    where the has been comic 
played impeccably by davis newman 
demonstrates his former
brilliance in a monologue
where clearly director gideon
gave mr newman free rein 
rising above rather commonplace material 
the actor creates a classic comic   
l guarantee this picture
will do 30 million domestic  at least 
  one of you better get somebody 
  what 
l think l m in trouble 
    chopping off the ends of scenes
before the drama is played out 
left this reviewer with bewilderment
and a four aspirin headache 
using my four balloon rating system 
l give  the stand up  haif a balloon 
  how are you feeling 
  the truth  l m scared 
roll  em 
action  oh  my god   
ladies and gentlemen  the doctors 
l m dr hyman  the internist 
l m dr garry  the surgeon 
  l m dr ballinger  the cardiologist 
  five  six  seven  eight   
the heart is the viscus that maintains
the circulation of the blood 
that means he had total blockage in   
two arteries 
this is the man who would be
my first choice as a modern day saint 
when l was in those marches  like selma 
this brother was shufflin 
right alongside me 
long before those cats who thought
civil rights was a hip scene
and jumped on the blackwagon 
the blackwagon  oh  ladies
and gentlemen  let me lay on ya   
  a great entertainer 
  a great entertainer 
  a great humanitarian 
  a great humanitarian 
  and my dearest friend 
  and my dearest friend
  blah blah 
  for 17 years 
  ladies and gentlemen   
  see how much l learn from you 
  l m afraid you ve learned too much from me 
  there you are  mr gideon 
this is one of my a1 
first rate  top drawerjobs 
tha s it  good luck tomorrow 
what did you mean  l learned too much 
you re gonna make it  l m hardly ever wrong 
thanks 
remember last tuesday night 
lt was raining    very hard 
oh  yeah  yeah  it was raining  what about it 
l called you at midnight 
l must have been walking the dog 
l don t have time for this sort of thing 
you were with someone 
yes 
and you made love to him 
yeah 
well  tha s it  huh  we re finished 
l don t know 
how do you feel about me 
l love you 
then l guess we re not finished 
because l really do love you  katie 
  you mean that 
  ah  hell  no 
l was pissed off at her 
l don t know  yeah  l did mean it 
sort of  sometimes l don t know where
the bullshit ends and the truth begins 
l just wanted to say something nice to her 
why 
ln case   
ln case   
ln case 
lf l die  l m sorry for all
the bad things l did to ya 
and if l live  l m sorry for all
the bad things l m gonna do to you 
   as stated in the declarations 
sustained directly as the result of injury 
sickness  death of  or permanent disability   
excuse me  mr clark 
larry  give me our figures 
well  on an estimated
production budget of  941 000 
with a contingency of 59 000
to round it out to the million 
so far we re in for
at least two thirds of the fees 
design  8 000  costumes  8 000 
electrics  4 000 
we re in for the full director choreographer 
15 000  casting is another four 
construction of scenery  where more than
half has been done  tha s 125 000    plus 
stage manager s about 8 000 
press agent 1500  musicians about    two 
assistants  secretaries  etc  3 000 
rehearsal halls and auditions    9500 
script and administrative  1500 
managers  l d say    ten 
advertising and printing  about 20 000 
orchestrations  so far  around 10 000 
legal  10 000  auditing  2 000 
payroll taxes    maybe seven 
well  seven  author s advances  10 000 
equity bonds  50 000 
rehearsal salaries  and we ve made some
advances to a few of the cast  about 43 000 
we re in for about   
 480 500 
yes  tha s the figure l had here 
and change 
let me try to understand 
of that figure  how much do we recoup 
yeah  l m confused too  do we
get all of that  or part of it  or what 
simply  here are the options 
one  if mr gideon recovers
and you resume production within the
180 days  we are not liable for any part of it 
two  if mr gideon should die and you resume
production with another director
within the 180 days  we are still not liable 
three  however  if mr gideon
should expire before february 1 
and you abandon production 
we are liable for the full million dollars 
this means  gentlemen 
you could make a profit of   
 519 500 
you could be the first show on broadway
to make a profit without really opening 
well

thank you  wonderful  wonderful 
folks  what can l tell you
about my next guest 
this cat allowed himseif
to be adored  but not loved 
and his success in show business
was matched by failure
in his personal relationship bag 
now tha s where he really bombed 
and he came to believe that work 
show business  love  his whole life 
even himself  and all thatjazz  was bullshit 
he became numero uno game player 
to the point where he didn t know
where the games ended and reality began 
like  to this cat  the only reality   
is death  man 
ladies and gentlemen  let me lay
on you a so so entertainer 
not much of a humanitarian 
and this cat was never nobody s friend 
ln his final appearance on the great stage
of life   you can applaud if you wanna  
mr joe gideon

there s no business like show business
like no business l know
everything about it is appealing
everything the traffic will allow
nowhere could you get that happy feeling
when you are stealing that extra bow
there s no people like show people
they smile when they are low
yesterday they told you
you would not go far
that night you open  and there you are
next day on your dressing room 
they ve hung a star
le s go on with the show
the costumes  the scenery 
the make up  the props
the audience that lifts you
when you re down
the headaches  the heartaches 
the backaches  the flops
the sheriff who escorts you out of town
the opening when your heart
beats like a drum
the closing  when
the customers don t come
there s no business like show business
like no business l know
you get word before the show has started
that your favourite uncle died at dawn
on top of that your pa and ma have parted
you re brokenhearted  but you go on
there s no people like show people
they smile when they are low
even with a turkey that you know has fold
you may be stranded out in the cold
but still you wouldn t change it
