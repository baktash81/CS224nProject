okay its alright
see you at 5 o clock alright
here you go hey go home go on
you think it was better that time
laughter
inaudible
alright you remember we were
talking about john philip sousa
a great march composer
at the turn of the century
he very famous man but he
had a huge thing about
recorded music he never
allowed his music to be recorded
even when thomas edison
came to him
with his brand new invention
the phonograph
but edisons didnt care he
went ahead and did it anyhow
he secretly recorded his
marching band in a parade
i guess makes it the very
first bootleg
so what do you think about that
do you think sousa was right
do you think its okay now
what about todays performance
will you be able to just walk up
to the middle of the stage
plug in your cd player to a marshall
stack and thats it good enough
i dont know
i am a lot older than you but
i tend to think that
theres an element of music
that cannot be capture
life cannot be capture
the human heart cannot
be captured
the moment of creation
itself is fleeting
oh my god
whats wrong with him
it looks like a heart attack
hey hachi howre you doing
hey hachi

is not more than the soul
and nothing not god is greater
to one than one self is
i hear
behold god in every object
that understand god not
in the least
nor do i understand whos there
can be more wonderful than myself
in the faces of men and women
i see god and in my own face
in a glance

dropped in the street

gods name
