okay  it s alright 
see you at 5 o  clock  alright 
here you go  hey  go home  go on 
you think it was better that time 
 laughter 
 inaudible 
alright  you remember we were
talking about john philip sousa 
a great march composer
at the turn of the century 
he    very famous man but he
had a huge thing about   
    recorded music  he never
allowed his music to be recorded 
even when thomas edison
came to him
with his brand new invention
  the phonograph 
but edison s didn t care  he
went ahead and did it anyhow 
he secretly recorded his
marching band in a parade 
i guess makes it the very
first boot leg 
so what do you think about that 
do you think sousa was right 
do you think it s okay now 
what about today s performance 
will you be able to just walk up   
to the middle of the stage 
plug in your cd player to a marshall
stack and that s it  good enough 
i don t know 
i am a lot older than you but
i tend to think that
there s an element of music   
    that cannot be capture 
life cannot be capture 
the human heart cannot
be captured 
the moment of creation
itself is fleeting 
oh my god 
what s wrong with him 
it looks like a heart attack 
hey hachi    how re you doing 
hey hachi 
see you tomorrow  hachi 
good night  hachi

sorry  i m learning 
andy  time to go    sweetheart 
good boy  you stay here  okay 
we ll be back 
i ve said that the soul is
not more than the body 
and i have said  that the body
is not more than the soul 
and nothing  not god is greater
to one than one self is 
i hear 
behold god in every object
that understand god not
in the least 
nor do i understand who s there
can be more wonderful than myself 
in the faces of men and women 
i see god and in my own face
in a glance 
i find letters from god
dropped in the street
and everyone signed by
god s name 
but i leave them where there are
for i know that wherever i go 
others will constant comes 
forever and ever
