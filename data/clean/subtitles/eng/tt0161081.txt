     with no bangs     
     cursing his ass off in finnish 
oh  claire 
i made an honest woman of her 
how long have you been in vermont 
oh  well  norman grew up here 
remember beau flynn  head of cardio
at the hospital  he was just sacked 
i just dropped her off at college 
he was involved in some stalking
incident  an intern  some girl

 right after michael died 
 michael who 
 marlov 
claire s first husband 
 oh  the musician 
 yeah 
you know  we all toured together 
have you heard her play

i would sit on stage     
     during claire s solo     
     and i mean  truly  i had tears
streaming down my face 
i mean  she s fabulous 
so why did you stop 
well  one night  after a concert     
     i met a dashing  handsome     
     genius scientist     
     and three months later 
i was married 
is that when you guys
moved up to vermont 
no  we were living in boston     
     when norman was offered a position 
a position 
the dupont chair in genetics 
i see  so now you re teaching
at your father s school here 
i actually don t     
     do much teaching anymore 
i run a research project 
norman s father had this old stuffy  
  stately place on a lake 
 which we re renovating 
 practically gutted 
 no  we didn t 
 yes  we did 
 gutted   
 wait till you see it  it s beautiful 
 it is beautiful  you ll see it 
it s haunted 
no 
is it really 
claire s hearing things 
what  what are you hearing 
i don t know  i heard     
     voices  whispering       
a picture fell 
you know  i completely believe
in all that 
you do 
i do 
wait a minute 
who do you think it is 
i know exactly who it is 
it s my old man 
he s pissed about us
dicking around with the house 
claire 
jesus       
it s all right 
calm down  claire 
it s okay 
whose idea was it 
mine  his 
we both thought       
i didn t want to come here 
 then why did you 
 he was worried about me 
 your husband 
 yes 
i m sure he s hoping you ll pack me
full of prozac or lithium     
     so he can live out his life
in peace 
 do you really think so 
 no 
are you on medication 
no  well  valium 
for sleeping 
having trouble sleeping 
sometimes 
when i get anxious 
do you get anxious only at night 
no  i only take valium at night 
for sleeping 
why do you get anxious 
i don t know 
why do you think
your husband s worried 
because       
i don t know 
because ever since caitlin left  
ever since my daughter left
for school     
     there have been       
i ve been       
why is this so hard 
here  have a fireball 
thank you 
it s hard because i m
a complete stranger     
     and you re talking about
incredibly personal things 
besides  most people  when they
come the first time  are wondering     
     if i think they re crazy 
don t worry  i m required     
     to have three sessions
before i can commit 
that was a joke 
these are good  they re hot 
there s a ghost in my house 
i saw her in the water  beside me     
     in the bathtub 
what does she look like 
she looked like     
     me 
only she had green eyes 
any idea who she is 
maybe  but i d rather not say
just yet 
fine 
what do you think i should do 
try to contact her 
communicate with her somehow 
find out what she wants 
what do you want me to do 
go buy a ouija board 
are we hoping the ghost
will have to use the potty 
this is where she was 
this is where l     
     saw her 
that makes sense 
 where did you finally find one 
 kmart 
i think we re supposed to sit
in a protective circle  aren t we 
what s that for 
 where did you get it 
 never mind 
you stole her shoe 
you have to have something
of the dead woman s 
says who 
is that blood on it 
i don t know  just place your fingers
on the message indicator 
okay 
we wish to commune     
     with the spirit

how s your marriage

we ve had our moments  i guess     
     but he s a wonderful husband
and father 
i mean  sure  he can be obsessed
with his work     
     and sometimes it s like     
     that he doesn t see me 
or  you know     
     iike i m       
that there s something wrong     
     with me

let s deal with that 
i m willing to deal with that

 would you like a cup of coffee 
 very much 
that day at the fence   
     you seemed terrified 
i don t think i imagined that 
no 
what were you so afraid of 
have you ever felt so completely
consumed by a feeling for someone     
     that you couldn t breathe 
thought that your time together
was so     
     passionate and consuming that you
felt physical pain when they d leave 
sure 
i couldn t catch my breath     
     and i panicked 
i never dreamed anyone would hear me 
i tried to leave him 
i went to my mother s in providence     
     but he brought my things up     
     in the middle of the night     
     during the rainstorm

i thought it was mrs  feur 
but it s not 
i m positive this time

then what  claire  what 
tell me what to do 
it s her 
so let me ask you this       
mr  mccain 
 mccann 
 mccann 
nothing was ever found 
no car  or      
listen    
this girl s a real live wire 
she drives around in a souped up
mustang convertible 
most people think she s   
   off around mexico or somewhere
with her friends 
the police downgraded it to a runaway 
her mother lives out here
in addison county 
 mrs  frank 
 yeah 
i m claire 
i wanted to talk to you about madison 
just plain coffee 
 none of that mocha nonsense 
 fine 
you look a little old for a student 
i m not a student  we met at a party 
well  that sounds about right 
i never understood how a girl
that wild got all a s 
she liked to read a lot  though 
sometimes she d lock herself up
in her room for days  just reading 
they wanted to put her in a school
for the gifted when she was young 
maddie wouldn t hear about it 
i don t know where she got it 
she didn t get it from me 
she probably got it
from her father s side of the family 
she never really mentioned her father 
yeah  well  she wouldn t 
she was 1 2 when he left 
never spoke about him after that 
you don t even need the sound 
you can pretty much tell
what s happening by the faces 
i turn it up sometimes  though 
feels like there s someone here 
why are you here 
i don t know 
you want to see her room 
full scholarship 
princeton too 
she wanted to stay on the east coast 
you must be so proud 
these are the last pictures
taken of her 
the police used this one 
let me get that  excuse me 
claire 
claire 
 hello  dr  spencer 
 mrs  spencer 
forbidden fruit 
you got a problem with that 
guess this means you re not
mad at me anymore  huh 
i wouldn t go that far 
take it easy  huh 
what s got into you 
 ow 
 what s the matter 
it s too rough 
since when 
this is a brand new  
 okay  claire  that s  
 why don t you shut up  professor 
why don t you just     
     shut up 
i think she s starting
to suspect something 
who 
your wife 
stop it 
you know 
what the hell are you doing 
i know 
i was there 
just before the accident 
i remember now 
what 
i came to the door 
there was whispering 
i saw you in the mirror     
     iying there with her     
     in our house 
claire  listen to me 
she was at the dupont party     
     staring at me  it was her 
that s why i couldn t breathe 
that s why i dropped the glass 
honey  that was last year 
we were having troubles 
so you slept with a fucking student 
 that s not what i m saying 
 don t touch me 
get away from me 
get out 
i said  get out 
fine 
claire  please  please 
i gave up everything 
claire  please don t       
 my life  my music 
 i never asked you to quit 
there was never any other choice 
you had to topple perfect daddy 
that meant perfect wife 
 perfect family 
 that s not fair 
you were touring with a baby     
     and you were happy to give it up 
when you did  you hated me for it 
so you gave it all to her 
 who 
 caitlin 
leave her out of this 
and then some bright
young woman finds me attractive 
 stop it 
 and i slipped 
 god help me  i slipped 
 i m not gonna listen 
 claire  i tried to break it off 
 you should ve tried harder 
i was in adamant 
in adamant 
you know  that artsy little hippie
village a couple hours away down on 7 
i stopped at this café to get coffee 
and i see norman sitting in the back 
but he wasn t alone 
it was a young blond woman 
i didn t see her face 
i didn t think anything of it
at first 
and i was walking over to say hello 
and they started arguing
in such a way     
     that it stopped me 
then a few days later 
you were in the accident 
and i get a bizarre call from stan
working at the hospital     
     asking me  was i with you that day 
if you were upset about anything 
he made it sound
like you had deliberately     
     driven your car into a tree 
and i thought   oh  my god 
claire s found out   
and when i went to the hospital 
i see norman 
and he was so desperate
at the thought     
     of losing you 
i couldn t say anything 
please

i called you last night 
i left a message on jody s machine 
i want you to answer one question 
did you have anything to do
with her disappearance 
yes 
i had an affair with her 
and when i tried to break it off     
     she became unstable 
she came out here to the house 
she threatened to kill herself     
     or you 
i didn t think she d
go through with any of it 
but then she       
she disappeared 
it was her  norman 
she tried to kill you 
 claire 
 you said it yourself 
she wanted you dead 
are you saying i was attacked
by a ghost 
you had an affair with a girl     
     who threatened to kill herself  and
now there s a presence in our house 
a young  blond girl 
don t you get it 
she did it  norman 
she s dead     
     and now she s trying to hurt you
or both of us 
 you don t know that she s dead 
 of course we do 
it s the only thing that makes  
oh  god 
it s my fault  i       
i opened the door 
 madison  i stole her hair 
 from where 
 and it gave her power 
 claire 
nothing attacked me 
there are no ghosts 
it was an accident  i m fine 
it s not your fault 
are you listening to me 
 yes 
 claire  say it 
say it 
 lt was an accident 
it s not my fault   
say it  claire 
i need to go lie down 
i didn t sleep last night 
and i need to lie down 
i want to be alone for a while 
hey  teddy  it s me 
right  yeah 
what s the name of that friend of
yours  that who you gonna call guy 
the guy that does the paranormal
psych stuff 
holodnik 
could you contact him and ask him
to give me a call here 
i d really like to talk to him today 
hello 
yes  this is he 
thanks for calling back 
no  sir  that was my father 
yeah  he passed away
a couple of years ago 
yes  he was  thank you 
look  the reason i m calling is       
i m a little out of my depth here 
someone who is very close to me     
     believes herself to be
or seems to be     
     in contact with some kind of     
     entity or spirit  and  
no  there s no     
     no history of delusional behavior 
well  i guess what i m asking is 
is it possible that she could be     
     causing these manifestations     
     through some kind of unconscious
or telekinetic   
is there anything else
that it could be 
and this has been documented 
really 
i m sorry 
but could i call you back     
     or have you call me back 
please  yes  that ll be great 
thank you  sir

jesus  claire 
listen to me 
when i got here     
     she was already dead  she killed
herself in our house to destroy me 
do you think i m stupid 
she left that for you in the garden 
with a letter 
i burned the letter
and threw the box in the lake 
a week before     
     she showed up at the dupont party 
i was terrified 
she insisted  so i agreed
to meet her here 
when i got here     
     she had taken pills 
i tried to revive her  but     
     she was gone 
there was nothing i could do 
so i put her in her car     
     and i drove to the boat ramp     
     and i rolled it out into the lake 
i made a terrible mistake 
i know that 
but tell me  claire 
what should i have done 
should i sacrifice everything 
our marriage 
my work 
which i spent my whole life on 
tell me  claire 
tell me  please  because we can
put this behind us 
our life can go on 
it s not too late 
what are you asking me to do 
i m asking you to forgive me 
that girl must be brought up 
hello  this is dr  norman spencer 
i have some information     
     about a missing person 
madison frank  yes

out to the house  please 
1 5 willoughby lane 
it s about a mile from the bridge 
okay 
thank you 
i m gonna go get dressed 
information  what city 
don t 
stop it 
i begged you  claire 
i pleaded with you 
but you wouldn t let it go 
oh  claire 
i never wanted any of this to happen 
all i ever wanted     
     was for you to love me 
be proud of me 
to be happy 
she was going to go to the dean 
she would have ruined us 
did she think i was just
gonna sit there     
     and watch it happen 
you have no idea what it was like 
hold her underwater     
     watch her life slip away 
but she gave me no choice 
and neither have you 
i can t figure out
how you put it all together 
at first i thought you knew 
thought you created the whole
ghost thing as an elaborate trap 
then i realized you believed it 
it was a passive aggressive
masterpiece 
the first time i met you     
     all i ever wanted was to spend
the rest of my life with you 
it s not gonna happen now 
too cold 
i almost froze to death laying here     
     wet  naked  pretending to be
electrocuted 
hey  coop

thanks 
the halothane s starting to wear off 
i m sure in some     
     tragic way 
your suicide is gonna     
     help bring caitlin and i
closer together
