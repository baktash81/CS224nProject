so why did you stop
well one night after a concert
i met a dashing handsome
genius scientist
and three months later
i was married
is that when you guys
moved up to vermont
no we were living in boston
when norman was offered a position
a position
the dupont chair in genetics
i see so now youre teaching
at your fathers school here
i actually dont
do much teaching anymore
i run a research project
normans father had this old stuffy
stately place on a lake
which were renovating
practically gutted

dicking around with the house
claire
jesus

full of prozac or lithium
so he can live out his life
in peace
do you really think so
no
are you on medication
no well valium
for sleeping
having trouble sleeping
sometimes
when i get anxious

she liked to read a lot though
sometimes shed lock herself up
in her room for days just reading
they wanted to put her in a school
for the gifted when she was young
maddie wouldnt hear about it
i dont know where she got it
she didnt get it from me
she probably got it
from her fathers side of the family
she never really mentioned her father
yeah well she wouldnt
she was 1 2 when he left
never spoke about him after that
you dont even need the sound
you can pretty much tell
whats happening by the faces
i turn it up sometimes though
feels like theres someone here
why are you here

in such a way
that it stopped me
then a few days later
you were in the accident
and i get a bizarre call from stan
working at the hospital
asking me was i with you that day
if you were upset about anything
he made it sound
like you had deliberately
driven your car into a tree
and i thought oh my god
claires found out
and when i went to the hospital

and he was so desperate
at the thought
of losing you
i couldnt say anything

hello
yes this is he
thanks for calling back
no sir that was my father
yeah he passed away
a couple of years ago
yes he was thank you
look the reason im calling is
im a little out of my depth here
someone who is very close to me
believes herself to be
or seems to be
in contact with some kind of
entity or spirit and
no theres no
no history of delusional behavior
well i guess what im asking is
is it possible that she could be
causing these manifestations
through some kind of unconscious
or telekinetic
is there anything else
that it could be
and this has been documented
really
im sorry
but could i call you back
or have you call me back

you killed her didnt you
i did not
i didnt kill anyone
jesus claire
listen to me
when i got here
she was already dead she killed
herself in our house to destroy me
do you think im stupid
she left that for you in the garden
with a letter
i burned the letter
and threw the box in the lake
a week before
she showed up at the dupont party
i was terrified
she insisted so i agreed
to meet her here
when i got here
she had taken pills
i tried to revive her but
she was gone
there was nothing i could do
so i put her in her car
and i drove to the boat ramp
and i rolled it out into the lake
i made a terrible mistake
i know that
but tell me claire
what should i have done
should i sacrifice everything
our marriage
my work
which i spent my whole life on
tell me claire
tell me please because we can
put this behind us
our life can go on

stop it
i begged you claire
i pleaded with you
but you wouldnt let it go
oh claire
i never wanted any of this to happen
all i ever wanted
was for you to love me
be proud of me
to be happy
she was going to go to the dean
she would have ruined us
did she think i was just
gonna sit there
and watch it happen
you have no idea what it was like
hold her underwater
watch her life slip away
but she gave me no choice
and neither have you
i cant figure out
how you put it all together
at first i thought you knew
thought you created the whole
ghost thing as an elaborate trap
then i realized you believed it
it was a passiveaggressive
masterpiece
the first time i met you
all i ever wanted was to spend
the rest of my life with you
its not gonna happen now
too cold
i almost froze to death laying here
wet naked pretending to be
electrocuted
