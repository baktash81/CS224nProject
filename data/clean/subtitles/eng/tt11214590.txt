she was a star
i remember at her funeral

silent remembrance
maurizio noticed the priest
lighting candles

happy birthday
he turned maybe
the saddest moment of my life

oh please to what do i owe
this unexpected pleasure
well i came
first and foremost
to say well
hmm
hello
well hello
uh was there anything else
speaks italian
maurizio and my father
have been spending
a lot of time together
in new york
and i thought
maybe you and i
could do the same
why would i
paolo well to discuss
rodolfo to discuss what
my ideas
you have ideas
boof
does an elephant
shit in the jungle
i was born with a gift
i am an artist
my father
he just wont see it
but
these are yours
how come the family doesnt
know you have a gift
domenico did you know
paolo had a gift
im afraid i did not sir
well we both know
hes blind in one eye
and deaf in the other so
this is
oh wait
let me show you
speaks italian
these were inspired
by my trip to cuba
i call this collection
havana libre
lots of pastels
rum inspired sunsoaked
and lots of browns
you have pastels
and brown together
yes yes yes
i know its musical
paolo
yeah
you must not show these
to anyone
keep them hidden
i mean it
you feel they might steal
my ideas right
oh call me a lawyer
not you
over the years i have found
that true talent is often
unaware of its own brilliance
it must be cherished
and protected
whereas hacks
they run around
shouting their
delicious ideas
begging to be recognized
blind
to their own
mediocrity
my dear nephew
you have achieved
a triumph of mediocrity
and you have also achieved
the unimaginable
you have found one thing
upon which your father and i
can agree
your total incompetence
oh no
forgive me
but i
i have to take a meeting
you designed this scarf
correct
oh yes
that scarf is my signature
it has caressed the necks
of all the worlds beauties
jackie o grace sofia
study it closely
no browns no pastels
come
yes
door closes
i dont need anyone
im paolo
paolo gucci
and i am going to start
my own line
baby cooing
mr gucci

si si
baby fusses
grazie
my father is ill
ciao franco
ciao franco
maurizio
coughing
excuse me excuse me
what is this
im a grandfather
patrizia
her name is alessandra
like maurizios mother
whose idea was that
mine
well
alessandra
here come here
come come come
my boy
you take care of gucci now
hmm
im glad it wasnt a boy
we need more women
in this family
indistinct chattering
there is no love on earth
greater than that of a father
for his son
with a few exceptions
thank you for coming uncle
come to new york
join the family
make him proud
ill think about it
yeah
domenico
the house in st moritz
two beach houses
one in nassau
the other in taormina
twentythree horses
penthouse apartment
in galleria passarella
the only one in all of milan
with a swimming pool
and of course
50 of gucci spa
but there is
a slight complication
he rodolfo he never signed
the share certificate
maurizio
okay what does that mean
domenico youll have
to pay inheritance tax
oh thats fine
how much are we talking
domenico could be as high
as 14 billion lire
maurizio 14 billion
yeah
i cant afford that
well you could
sell your shares
maurizio to who
i can think of a few qualified individuals
thank you
leave them with us
well review them
as soon as were done mourning
of course
who does he think he is
suggesting you sell
your shares
madness
fourteen billion is totally
unreasonable
and just because your father
forgot to sign it
giuseppina ten of spades
represents theft or loss
someone wants what is yours
dont let them take it
and dont trust anybody
because i see
an abuse of trust
an attempt to deceive you in
your own house you understand
yes pina
always have something red
on you for protection
and wear more green
green is for cleansing
green doesnt go
with my lipstick
change your lipstick
patrizia laughs
youre already so beautiful
or wear green underwear
maybe its time for you
to take back
dont let these forces
around you dictate who you are
youre strong
youre magnificent
and
hmm look at this
theres a great love
in your life
together you can conquer
the world
patrizia look at me
you will be the queen
you
i feel love playing
hi

birthday gift
from my husband
its a gucci
just like yours
which gucci store did he go to
people chattering
patrizia who is
making this stuff
whos allowing this to happen
as far as fakes go
theyre pretty good
i mean id buy them
chuckles
dont be such a cretin
dont call me
a cretin sweetie
thats not what i said
i asked you not to be one
this is serious
and youre laughing it off
at least its my name
on the mugs not yours
our name sweetie
on junk
aldo theyre not fake
by the way
theyre replicas
i was just very
very surprised
well you know what else
would surprise you
how profitable this stuff is
what about quality
your sacred cows
aldo quality is for the rich
if a long island housewife
wants to
live with the illusion that
she is a gucci customer
why not let her
because it damages
guccis credibility
patrizia this is us
this is not a girls game
maurizio yeah but aldo
shes right
this stuff is junk
its not what gucci is
gucci
is what i say it is
i turned it into an empire
not rodolfo
certainly not my son
and uh
of course not you so
without me
youd all still be
shoveling cow shit in tuscany
thats a fact
remember that
we should remember that
upbeat music playing
brava
woman bravo bravo
audience cheering
a martini please
bartender yes sir

oh it was incredible
the the
the lines and tones
well whats your name

work for gucci
right now gucci
guccis just a cheap operetta
grazia
salud
well enjoy yourself
do you want to be left
in the dust
you want to keep selling
coffee mugs in airports
is that your legacy
its time to
take out the trash
aldo and paolo theyre poison
theyre an embarrassment
to this company
and everybody knows it
they have to go
and you need to get your
fucking business organized
maurizio patrizia
theyre my family
exhales
so am i
hes starting a trade war
paolo barely has enough
to bankroll a pair of socks
let alone start a war
with anyone
i dont want to see it
domenico yes but he could
still be a problem
aldo has awarded him a number
of shares in the company
yes but aldo didnt realize
what an idiot
paolo turned out to be
maurizio we need
to build a bridge
with paolo and work things out
you know how emotional he gets
hes around all this
male energy all the time
his wife isnt exactly
the brightest
he needs someone
he can talk to
who he trusts
who listens to him
someone like who
laughs
paolo likes me
domenico scoffs
you do have
a natural advantage
you are not a gucci
i
i need an espresso
can i ask you a question
you just did
huh
you just asked me a question
and what you really
want to know is
whether you can ask me
two questions
one of which
youve already asked
laughing
thats good
domenico very funny
okay here is
my second question
what do you see as being
your purpose at gucci
is this a job interview
maybe
im a conservationist
gucci is a rare animal
it must be protected
protected from who
from whoever threatens it
i find it very interesting that
you have such
a strong connection
to that which is not yours
uh
sometimes it takes an outsider
to see the truth
bravo
paolo this one reminds me
of childhood
yeah well its a memory
wrapped in lycra
its just so you
its exquisite
do you think so
you have a gift
im telling you
oh well stop
stop youre going
to make me
youre going to make me cry
nobody has ever
said that to me nobody
paolo why dont you have
your own line
these are just mockups
i cant afford to get serious
with your gift
and your talent
and your vision
are you kidding
gucci needs new blood
goodbye 1930s
hello 80s huh
oh you took the words
right out of my guts
paolo gucci is coming
paolo scatting
come on continues scatting
groans
sighs
im disgusted by the way
your father treats you
sighs
leaving you behind
to groom maurizio
its not right
who does he think he is
well a dinosaur posing
as a butthole
chuckles
laughing
you were a comedian
in a past life
paolo wheezing
maurizio likes you
paolo ah
he always has
well i like my cousin too
hes quiet like a
like a little mouse
uh tiny little mousy
doesnt scream like the others
no he doesnt and you
and maurizio together
that would be amazing
thats a new chapter for gucci
paolo no no no
my father
he would never allow it
hes got my little peaches
in a very tight grip
paolo
maybe its time
to respectfully
leave him behind
you are justified
i do have
something on my father
can you keep a secret
cross your heart
and hope to die
father son
and house of gucci
paolo okay
okay
well you know
patrizia you dont
have to tell me
listen
its just
i can come back any time
we can talk about your designs
but what would i get
out of this
we could offer you
an exclusive deal
to distribute your own line
under gucci
i should talk to maurizio
maurizio you talked to him
when
thunder rumbling
today
he showed me his designs
why didnt you tell me
patrizia im telling you now
arent i
sputters patrizia
thats not the point
dont focus on the process
focus on the result
i told him
wed distribute
his clothing line
under gucci
and he committed to a deal
maurizio those designs
wont see the light of day
we need paolo on our side
what game are you playing
im looking out
for our best interests
is that a game
rain pattering
thunder rumbling
beeps
paolo exclaims
mau mau
thank you for coming
you thought i lost my touch
no not yet
maurizio ciao paolo
you sounded urgent
so i came right away
very well
i got these from three
of his ex secretaries
hes not exactly
a favorite among the exs
in fact
they all hate his guts
gucci is a very black hole
of undeclared income
paolo this is fraud
on a global scale
in italy taxes are okay
but in america
it is very different
we should keep this
to ourselves
sputters but we can use it
as leverage
to persuade him a bit
and with you
on my side
we have the majority we need
for you to become your own man
and he wont get into
any real trouble right
no sputters at this point
worst case scenario
he pays his taxes
they slap his wrists
happens all the time
but more importantly
he would see you
he would see you
sighs
i could finally soar
exhales like a pigeon
paolo im tired of being
held back
father im tired
of being held back
im serious
im serious

maurizio and i stayed there
five years ago
we had the most amazing time
i begged maurizio to take me
there for my 25th birthday
and of course he obliged
as soon as we landed
we went to the jules verne restaurant
in the eiffel tower
its at the top
no no no
its on the second floor
it was magnificent
later we went to the louvre
id always dreamt
of seeing the louvre
we arranged for a private tour
thank god
imagine all those crowds
i couldnt do it
they just want to know where
you got the macaroons sweetie
im telling them
yeah youre filling the story
full of unnecessary details
patrizia i dont think
our guests mind
they wouldnt say if they did
youre an unnecessary detail
laughing
what i am trying
to tell you is
de sole is the only person who
saw the unsigned certificates
he worked for my father for ten
years and he never questioned him
i trust him
hes not the problem
i heard the way you spoke
to me at lunch
hes not the problem
maurizio i was tired
next time dont embarrass
me in front of those people
those people
are friends of mine
ive known most of them
longer than you
he is the problem say it
patrizia i was tired
im tired
then wake yourself up
and say it
maurizio okay
when you make me
sneak around my own family
when you set father and son
against each other
and me against paolo
when you secondguess a person
like domenico de sole
the only person
my father trusted
these things have an effect on the
environment i operate in on me
actions have consequences
patrizia i did that for you
i was being constructive
im not gonna apologize
for that no thanks
my uncle is in prison and
my cousin thinks im scum
and you think
thats constructive
dont pin guccis problems
on me okay
im just here mopping up
your fucking mess
i never asked for your help
maurizio
were only stronger together
sighs
the only thing
i need from you
is to stay away from gucci
before you cause any more damage
i can handle it by myself
is that clear
truthfully im only
getting involved
because you are an
incompetent little baby idiot
youre a fucking
weak little brat
you really are only
one half of gucci
the shit half
and you want a real man
here
maybe youll grow a little
game beeping

i am trying to teach
alessandra
the importance of not touching
other peoples belongings
i dont consider myself a
particularly ethical person

just for ego
or the pleasure of it
for personal satisfaction
ill have my maid

you really really hurt me
door closes
paolo wont do it
hes too scared
of his father
domenico
hes drowning in debt

we need a cash partner
maurizio

they like highend
retail investments

ill be back soon
patrizia
somethings different
maurizios changed
hes excessive
and crazy
and that woman
giuseppina

they are smarter than they actually are
you mustnt let this
negative energy eat you up
huh

im unstoppable
im unstoppable
i am only 50 of gucci
im here representing
my own interests
i want someone to bring gucci to
the forefront of todays fashion
i want a partner who can buy
out the other half of gucci
thats giving me a headache
the half thats preventing
gucci from being great
the half that belongs to
your uncle and your cousin
investcorp has had great
success with tiffany
it is
it is a resurrection
true but tiffany isnt gucci
gucci is a family business
that means family problems

to me like a fucking normal human being
maurizio said you and alessandra can

sobbing
where is he right now
im not at liberty to say
look in my eyes

in these eyes
that would let you think that i would
ever let anyone ruin my daughters life
compromise her
do you
do you see that
you know that wont happen
i will relay the message
get the fuck out of here
yeah
for your review mr gucci
we hope youll find
this offer appealing
aldo well
id rather not read
my own obituary no
maestro i can assure you
theres no greater admirer
of gucci than myself
chuckling
oh god
to be able to finally sit down
with a member of the dynasty
its something
we will cherish forever
and truly
i understand
how difficult this is
please dont patronize me
please
those words
are not comforting to me
they make me feel offended
in a way i must say
mr gucci
i have a plane
that leaves in one hour
if there is a problem
with the offer
said and omar
theyre at your disposal
no no no
stuttering we are very
grateful for your offer
except no
right papa
that shoe you showed me
before
take a look inside your shoe
and see at the heel
theres something
you should see
i remember ordering
a pair of those
for clark gable
right before
he did the film mogambo
this is the rarest of shoes
you see that you see that
its a gold leaf
you know
i had to stop doing that
it got too expensive
so
where did you get that shoe
where
theres no way you bought
that shoe in london
who gave it to you

shareholder
of gucci
you must feel wonderful
boof
man you need to relax

you floating
you floating like in the air
floating floating
from there to there
go left to right
maurizio ms wintour walk into any one
of guccis 144 international boutiques
and you will find you are
walking into a new world
a new vision
but wasnt the lure of gucci
precisely its historical appeal
the legacy is remarkable
maurizio well this is true
we are products of our past but we
dont have to be prisoners of it
i dont fear change
i embrace it
where ralph lauren stores
they feel like movie sets
and versace
is a rock concert
gucci stores will feel
like the vatican of fashion
ashes to ashes playing
grazie
how are you funding
your vision
maurizio well that is a very good secret
chuckles
dont ask
it may take some time
to recover
but this is a longterm plan
sometimes you have to go down
to come back up again
ferre armani and versace
thats who i said i wanted
designing our new line
and they would be honored
to be working for us
de sole
where the fuck are they
maurizio they have
their own lines
theyre their own bosses
i know they have
ive spoken to everybody
nobody wants to
then you havent tried
hard enough
there is someone
maybe
here
who am i looking at
hes from texas
a mechanic
maybe you should meet him
man i see cranked up blacks
jeweltone velvet
and unconventional
styling touches
loafers sans socks
i see pole dancers
flanking the runways
female
and male of course
i have a vocabulary that
will allow you to expand
thats what the brand requires
thats where we need to head
without sacrificing the family
character of what this brand is
the family character
is the brand
im here to embellish
im here to resurrect
chuckles

tom ford when tom ford took over
the creative reins of gucci in 1994
there was little hope for
the milanese fashion house
it took a german designer
to stir up chanel
and it is an american who has put gucci
far and away in the front of fashion
some say mr ford will give
mr lagerfeld a run for his money
i have to call my mother
in austin
speaking other language
what an unforgettable night
maurizio
and the response
is incredible
ive never seen
anything like it
indeed it marks
a new chapter for gucci
hey try the carpaccio
it melts in your mouth
okay
speaking other language
i think we can all be honest with
each other around this table yeah
were all friends here
we can we all
respect each other
maurizio grazie
were very concerned
what concerns you
numbers
specifically guccis
well you said you didnt care
about numbers
that you trusted your instinct
yeah i care about numbers
when theyre terrible numbers
our projections for 1996
are abysmal
by slashing hundreds of
profitable items
you mean
my uncles knickknacks
man losses are likely to total
30 million this year on sales
of 180 million
down from 210 million in 1991
and 270 million
there is 85 million
in bank debts
we may even have trouble paying
salaries for the next couple of months
profits remain elusive
and ive always said that our
strategic plan would take five years
its not about
immediate profit
you go down
to come back up again
that is how you get out
of a stall
but the personal items
are a concern as well
all paid for through guccis
accounts and charged as expenses
the multimilliondollar
antiques in the stores
the purchase
of countless cars
including a ferrari f40
and a lamborghini countach
3 million on a watch
a patek philippe 2523
7 million on
a luxury penthouse
i could go on and on
an 18th century palatial villa
outside florence
for use as a training center
i have justifications
for all of these things
but it doesnt seem that
youre in a place to hear them
maurizio please try and take this
in the spirit of our friendship
weve been through
a lot together
you have many qualities
but we must be realistic
youre not a natural manager
you cant run a business purely
on charm and eccentricities
no you need time as well
last night does mark
a new chapter for gucci
and i am the one
that brought it to you
maurizio i want you
to understand
whatever happens between
both of our companies
i have never stopped
respecting you or your vision
but i have vision
for my people too
and i have a business to run
we want to offer you
150 million
for your 50 stake in gucci
chuckles softly
you want to buy me out
domenico
we want to save the business
and who would be
appointed ceo
chuckles
she was right about you
150 million
youll be a rich man
if you really think
its about money
then you know less about gucci
than i thought
speaking other language
speaking other language
excuse me
yes
this meat
where is it coming from
this is the finest beef
in tuscany
it comes from
the val di chiana
the cows
are treated like royalty
sighs
door slams shut
intense music playing
horn blaring incessantly
alarm beeping
thats him
good morning
