the only good thing that came
from my career was

now she 
she was a star 
i remember at her funeral   
during a moment of
silent remembrance 
maurizio noticed the priest
lighting candles   
and he began to sing
 happy birthday

the saddest moment of my life 
into something

 rodolfo  party 
yeah  luca sarzana s house 
at the palazzo serbelloni 
 rodolfo  yes  i know
where the sarzanas live 
you know   
there is a certain sort of
young woman   
who makes their fortune
from getting their hooks
into someone like you 
well  yes  father 
but patrizia is not like that 
 rodolfo  well  i had franco
do a little investigation 
i think
she s after your money

patrizia  you should know   
that the guccis

long after price is forgotten 
huh 
thoughts on paolo s outfit 
domenico 
you re the fashionista 
it s eccentric 
i designed this myself 
well  you should reconsider
your wardrobe choices  paolo 
you are gucci 
you need to dress the part 
it s chic 
my father s problem is that
he s stuck in the past 
he refuses to take gucci
into the next century 
   aldo  yes  gucci is doing fine under my watch 
   paolo  no 
  no  don t worry about it 
  oh  no 
no  no 
it needs new ideas 
  new energy 
  of course 
and i happen to be
bursting with creativity 
  yes  yes 
  yes  my bladder may be full   
but my dreams are even fuller 
i m like a rush of water 
somebody build a dam 
please 
 paolo  you re always
brushing me off 
i m a designer 
i need to express myself 
  but why all this sudden moaning 
  i have a   
   aldo  what do you want 
   paolo  because  i m so sick of you ignoring me

 maurizio  it s all bullshit

my grandfather guccio was
a bellhop in london 
that s where he got the idea
for leather goods 
by carrying bags around
for rich aristocrats 
gucci is like that cake 
what 
once you think there s enough
to go around   
then you ll have a taste 
and then you ll want more   
and then you ll want
the whole thing for yourself 
what about you 
you just gonna sit around
and watch them eat everything 
me  i am gucci by name 
i don t have
their tuscan character 
it was diluted by
my mother s german blood

this unexpected pleasure 
well  i came
first and foremost   
to say    well   
hmm 
hello 
well  hello 
uh  was there anything else 
 speaks italian 
maurizio and my father
have been spending
a lot of time together
in new york 
and i thought   
maybe you and i
could do the same 
why would i   
 paolo  well  to discuss   
 rodolfo  to discuss what 
my ideas 
  you have ideas 
  boof 
does an elephant
shit in the jungle 
i was born with a gift 
i am an artist 
my father 
he just won t see it 
but   
these are yours 
how come the family doesn t
know you have a gift 
domenico  did you know
paolo had a gift 
i m afraid i did not  sir 
well  we both know
he s blind in one eye
and deaf in the other  so

  oh  wait 
let me show you

you have pastels

yes  yes  yes 
i know  it s musical 
paolo 
yeah 
you must not show these
to anyone 
keep them hidden 
i mean it 
you feel they might steal
my ideas  right 
oh  call me a lawyer 
not you 
over the years  i have found   
that true talent is often
unaware of its own brilliance 
it must be cherished
and protected 
whereas hacks 
they run around   
shouting their
delicious ideas 
begging to be recognized 
blind   
to their own   
mediocrity 
my dear nephew 
you have achieved
a triumph of mediocrity 
and you have also achieved
the unimaginable 
you have found one thing   
upon which your father and i
can agree 
your total incompetence 
oh  no 
forgive me 
but i   
i have to take a meeting 
you designed this scarf 
correct 
oh  yes 
that scarf is my signature 
it has caressed the necks
of all the world s beauties 
jackie o  grace  sofia 
study it closely 
no browns  no pastels 
  come 
  yes 
 door closes 
i don t need anyone 
i m paolo 
paolo gucci 
and i am going to start   
my own line 
 baby cooing 
mr  gucci 
  are you okay 
  si  si 
 baby fusses 
grazie 
my father is ill 
  ciao  franco 
  ciao  franco 
maurizio 
 coughing 
excuse me  excuse me 
what is this 
i m a grandfather 
 patrizia 
her name is alessandra 
like maurizio s mother 
whose idea was that 
mine 
well   
alessandra 
here  come here 
come  come  come 
my boy 
you take care of gucci now 
hmm 
i m glad it wasn t a boy 
we need more women
in this family 
 indistinct chattering 
there is no love on earth
greater than that of a father
for his son 
with a few exceptions 
thank you for coming  uncle 
come to new york 
join the family 
make him proud 
i ll think about it 
yeah 
 domenico 
the house in st  moritz 
two beach houses 
one in nassau 
the other in taormina 
twenty three horses 
penthouse apartment
in galleria passarella   
the only one in all of milan
with a swimming pool 
and  of course 
50  of gucci s p a 
but    there is
a slight complication 
he  rodolfo  he never signed
the share certificate 
 maurizio 
okay  what does that mean 
 domenico  you ll have
to pay inheritance tax 
oh  that s fine 
how much are we talking 
 domenico  could be as high
as 14 billion lire 
   maurizio  14 billion 
  yeah 
i can t afford that 
well  you could
sell your shares 
 maurizio  to who 
  i can think of a few qualified individuals 
  thank you 
leave them with us 
we ll review them
as soon as we re done mourning 
of course 
who does he think he is 
suggesting you sell
your shares 
madness 
fourteen billion is totally
unreasonable 
and just because your father
forgot to sign it 
 giuseppina  ten of spades
represents theft or loss 
someone wants what is yours 
don t let them take it 
and don t trust anybody 
because i see
an abuse of trust 
an attempt to deceive you in
your own house  you understand 
yes  pina 
always have something red
on you for protection 
and wear more green 
green is for cleansing 
green doesn t go
with my lipstick 
  change your lipstick 
   patrizia laughs 
you re already so beautiful 
or wear green underwear 
maybe it s time for you
to take back 
don t let these forces
around you dictate who you are 
you re strong 
you re magnificent 
and   
hmm  look at this 
there s a great love
in your life 
together  you can conquer
the world 
patrizia  look at me 
you will be the queen 
you 
  i feel love  playing 
hi 
what a beauty 
what a beauty 
so good to see you 
come  come 
much to show you 
this is your new office 
wow 
i m across the hall 
if you need me 
okay 
  ooh
it s so good  it s so good     
look  enjoy 
  thank you 
  ciao  aldo 
 aldo  ciao 
 patrizia chuckles 
  ooh  
  heaven knows  heaven knows
heaven knows  heaven knows  
  heaven knows  
  ooh  
  i feel love  i feel love
i feel love  i feel love  
  i feel love  
  i feel love  
i got pane fresco 
if you didn t eat breakfast 
your father s gonna be very upset with you 
ira 
 ira  yes 
ira  is this yours 
yes 
birthday gift 
from my husband 
it s a gucci 
just like yours 
which gucci store did he go to 
 people chattering 
 patrizia  who is
making this stuff 
who s allowing this to happen 
as far as fakes go 
they re pretty good 
i mean  i d buy them 
 chuckles 
don t be such a cretin 
don t call me
a cretin  sweetie 
that s not what i said 
i asked you not to be one 
this is serious
and you re laughing it off 
at least it s my name
on the mugs  not yours 
our name  sweetie 
on junk 
 aldo  they re not fake 
by the way 
they re replicas 
i was just very 
very surprised 
well  you know what else
would surprise you 
how profitable this stuff is 
what about quality 
your sacred cows 
 aldo  quality is for the rich 
if a long island housewife
wants to   
live with the illusion that
she is a gucci customer   
why not  let her 
because it damages
gucci s credibility 
patrizia  this is us 
this is not a girl s game 
 maurizio  yeah  but  aldo 
she s right 
this stuff is junk 
it s not what gucci is 
gucci   
is what i say it is 
i turned it into an empire 
not rodolfo 
certainly not my son 
and  uh   
of course  not you  so   
without me   
you d all still be
shoveling cow shit in tuscany 
that s a fact 
remember that 
we should remember that 
 upbeat music playing 
brava 
 woman  bravo  bravo 
 audience cheering 
a martini  please 
 bartender  yes  sir 
did you like the show 
oh  it was incredible 
the    the   
the lines and tones 
well  what s your name 
my name 
maurizio 
maurizio what 
maurizio gucci 
maurizio gucci 
how about that  gucci 
you know  i used to
dress windows for gucci 
oh  really  which store 
i can t remember  it was   
it was god awful though 
walter  by the way 
i m a designer 
okay  walter 
well  maybe you will design
for me someday 
no  no designer here s gonna
work for gucci 
right now  gucci   
gucci s just a cheap operetta 
  grazia 
  salud 
well  enjoy yourself 
do you want to be left
in the dust 
you want to keep selling
coffee mugs in airports 
is that your legacy 
it s time to
take out the trash 
aldo and paolo  they re poison 
they re an embarrassment
to this company   
and everybody knows it 
they have to go 
and you need to get your
fucking business organized 
 maurizio  patrizia   
they re my family 
 exhales 
so am i 
he s starting a trade war 
paolo barely has enough
to bankroll a pair of socks 
let alone start a war
with anyone 
i don t want to see it 
 domenico  yes  but he could
still be a problem 
aldo has awarded him a number
of shares in the company 
yes  but aldo didn t realize
what an idiot
paolo turned out to be 
maurizio  we need
to build a bridge
with paolo and work things out 
you know how emotional he gets 
he s around all this
male energy all the time 
his wife isn t exactly
the brightest 
he needs someone
he can talk to 
who he trusts 
who listens to him 
someone like who 
 laughs 
  paolo likes me 
   domenico scoffs 
you do have
a natural advantage 
you are not a gucci 
i   
i need an espresso 
can i ask you a question 
you just did 
huh 
you just asked me a question 
and what you really
want to know is
whether you can ask me
two questions 
one of which
you ve already asked 
 laughing 
that s good 
domenico  very funny 
okay  here is
my second question 
what do you see as being
your purpose at gucci 
is this a job interview 
maybe 
i m a conservationist 
gucci is a rare animal 
it must be protected 
protected from who 
from whoever threatens it 
i find it very interesting that
you have such
a strong connection
to that which is not yours 
uh   
sometimes it takes an outsider
to see the truth 
bravo 
paolo  this one reminds me
of childhood 
yeah  well  it s a memory
wrapped in lycra 
it s just so you 
it s exquisite 
do you think so 
you have a gift 
i m telling you 
oh  well  stop 
stop  you re going
to make me   
you re going to make me cry 
nobody has ever
said that to me  nobody 
paolo  why don t you have
your own line 
these are just mock ups 
i can t afford to get serious 
with your gift 
and your talent 
and your vision   
are you kidding 
gucci needs new blood 
goodbye 1930s 
hello   80s  huh 
oh  you took the words
right out of my guts 
  paolo gucci is coming 
   paolo scatting 
come on   continues scatting 
 groans 
 sighs 
i m disgusted by the way
your father treats you 
 sighs 
leaving you behind
to groom maurizio 
it s not right 
who does he think he is 
well  a dinosaur posing
as a butthole 
 chuckles 
 laughing 
you were a comedian
in a past life 
 paolo wheezing 
maurizio likes you 
   paolo  ah   
  he always has 
well  i like my cousin too 
he s quiet like a   
like a little mouse 
uh  tiny little mousy 
doesn t scream like the others 
no  he doesn t  and you
and maurizio together   
that would be amazing 
  that s a new chapter for gucci 
   paolo  no  no  no 
my father 
he would never allow it 
he s got my little peaches
in a very tight grip 
paolo   
maybe it s time   
to respectfully   
leave him behind 
you are justified 
i do have   
something on my father 
can you keep a secret 
cross your heart
and hope to die 
father  son 
and house of gucci 
 paolo  okay 
okay 
well  you know   
 patrizia  you don t
have to tell me 
  listen   
  it s just   
i can come back any time 
we can talk about your designs 
but what would i get
out of this 
we could offer you
an exclusive deal
to distribute your own line
under gucci 
i should talk to maurizio 
 maurizio  you talked to him 
when 
 thunder rumbling 
today 
he showed me his designs 
why didn t you tell me 
 patrizia  i m telling you now 
aren t i 
 sputters  patrizia 
that s not the point 
don t focus on the process 
focus on the result 
i told him   
we d distribute
his clothing line
under gucci
and he committed to a deal 
maurizio  those designs
won t see the light of day 
we need paolo on our side 
what game are you playing 
i m looking out
for our best interests 
is that a game 
 rain pattering 
 thunder rumbling 
 beeps 
 paolo exclaims 
mau  mau 
thank you for coming 
you thought i lost my touch 
no  not yet 
 maurizio  ciao  paolo 
you sounded urgent 
so i came right away 
very well 
i got these from three
of his ex  secretaries  
he s not exactly
a favorite among the ex s 
in fact 
they all hate his guts 
gucci is a very black hole
of undeclared income 
paolo  this is fraud   
on a global scale 
in italy taxes are okay 
but in america   
it is very different 
we should keep this
to ourselves 
 sputters  but we can use it   
as leverage
to persuade him a bit 
and with you   
on my side   
we have the majority we need
for you to become your own man 
and he won t get into
any real trouble  right 
no   sputters  at this point   
worst case scenario 
he pays his taxes 
they slap his wrists 
happens all the time 
but more importantly 
he would see you 
he would see you 
 sighs 
i could finally soar   
 exhales  like a pigeon 
 paolo  i m tired of being
held back 
father  i m tired
of being held back 
i m serious 
i m serious 
i m tired of being held back 
i want freedom 
i m serious

yeah  where did you get  em 
there is this charming little place
by notre dame de lorette in paris 
 de lorette  
notre dame de lorette 
  right 
  de lorette 
maurizio and i stayed there
five years ago 
we had the most amazing time 
i begged maurizio to take me
there for my 25th birthday 
and of course  he obliged 
as soon as we landed 
we went to the jules verne restaurant   
in the eiffel tower 
it s at the top 
no  no  no 
it s on the second floor 
it was magnificent 
later we went to the louvre 
i d always dreamt
of seeing the louvre 
we arranged for a private tour 
thank god 
imagine all those crowds 
i couldn t do it 
they just want to know where
you got the macaroons  sweetie 
i m telling them 
yeah  you re filling the story
full of unnecessary details 
 patrizia  i don t think
our guests mind 
they wouldn t say if they did 
you re an unnecessary detail 
 laughing 
what i am trying
to tell you is   
de sole is the only person who
saw the unsigned certificates 
he worked for my father for ten
years and he never questioned him 
i trust him 
he s not the problem 
i heard the way you spoke
to me at lunch 
he s not the problem 
 maurizio  i was tired 
next time  don t embarrass
me in front of those people 
those people
are friends of mine 
i ve known most of them
longer than you 
he is the problem  say it 
patrizia  i was tired 
i m tired 
then wake yourself up
and say it 
 maurizio  okay 
when you make me
sneak around my own family 
when you set father and son
against each other   
and me against paolo 
when you second guess a person
like domenico de sole   
the only person
my father trusted 
these things have an effect on the
environment i operate in  on me 
actions have consequences 
 patrizia  i did that for you 
i was being constructive 
i m not gonna apologize
for that  no thanks 
my uncle is in prison and
my cousin thinks i m scum 
and you think
that s constructive 
don t pin gucci s problems
on me  okay 
i m just here mopping up
your fucking mess 
i never asked for your help 
maurizio   
we re only stronger together 
 sighs 
the only thing
i need from you   
is to stay away from gucci
before you cause any more damage 
i can handle it by myself 
is that clear 
truthfully  i m only
getting involved   
because you are an
incompetent  little baby idiot 
you re a fucking
weak little brat 
you really are only
one half of gucci 
the shit half 
and you want a real man 
here 
maybe you ll grow a little 
   game beeping

maurizio will love your strudel 
oh 
would you like a cigarette 
no 
 thanking in italian 
you ever steal anything  paola 
what 
forgive me 
i am trying to teach
alessandra   
the importance of not touching
other people s belongings 
i don t consider myself a
particularly ethical person   
but i am fair 
what i cannot
wrap my head around   
is people who steal
just for ego 
or the pleasure of it 
for personal satisfaction 
i ll have my maid
drop off the strudel 
good to see you 
 scoffs 
 clock chiming 
 clears throat 
 patrizia

maurizio

talk about it 
 sobs 
i ll find the right words to say
what i want to say when i m ready 
you really  really hurt me 
 door closes 
paolo won t do it 
he s too scared
of his father 
 domenico 
he s drowning in debt 
but we can t buy him out 
we need a cash partner 
maurizio 
who do you suggest 
investcorp 
it s owned by nemir kirdar 
he s an iraqi powerhouse 
they like high end
retail investments 
they bought tiffany s in  84
and turned it around quick 
maurizio 
 maurizio  plant the seed with him 
i ll be back soon 
 patrizia 
something s different 
maurizio s changed 
he s excessive   
and crazy 
and that woman   
 giuseppina

they are smarter than they actually are 
you mustn t let this
negative energy eat you up 
huh

i m unstoppable 
i m unstoppable 
i am only 50  of gucci

gucci from being great

success with tiffany

 maurizio 
oh  don t be scared

most people s apartment in monte carlo 
  ooh 
   maurizio chuckles 
  i ll try not to make a mess of it

 soft bossa nova music playing

 paola chuckles 
 maurizio  i can t   chuckles

 bossa nova music
continues playing 
tell me where he is

i couldn t see

 patrizia sniffles 
 shouting 
tell me where he is 
  largo al factotum  playing 
 crowd applauding 
 music stops 
 playing chatter 
  where is he 
  i m afraid he couldn t come 
what do you mean
he couldn t come 
he had a business in paris 
  he s lying and so are you 
  maurizio is very busy  patrizia 
he didn t even have the decency to
come to his daughter s last recital 
what kind of a father is he 
there will be
a new arrangement 
and why did he send you  huh 
hey  domenico 
why did he send you 
what  you re his
little fucking messenger 
he didn t have
the decency to come here 
he s too much of a coward
to do it himself 
i have the papers right here 
papers 
ah  papers 
i m not signing any papers 
you can tell him to come here and talk
to me like a fucking normal human being 
maurizio said you and alessandra can
continue to live in the penthouse
since it s no longer
his primary residence 
he s happy to extend payments until
you re able to stand on your own two feet 
  what are you talking about 
  please 
what are you saying 
what are you saying to me 
huh 
  these are words  domenico 
  support for alessandra 
  i m not talking to you 
  shared custody 
you come to my daughter s school 
what the fuck is wrong with you 
shared custody  he wants   
he wants to make this as easy
as possible for both of you 
 tearfully  shared custody 
are we talking about divorce 
is that what we re doing here 
where is he right now 
 sobbing 
where is he right now 
i m not at liberty to say 
look in my eyes 
do you see anything
in these eyes
that would let you think that i would
ever let anyone ruin my daughter s life 
compromise her 
do you 
do you see that 
you know that won t happen 
i will relay the message 
get the fuck out of here 
yeah 
for your review  mr  gucci 
we hope you ll find
this offer appealing 
 aldo  well   
i d rather not read
my own obituary  no 
maestro  i can assure you
there s no greater admirer
of gucci than myself 
 chuckling 
oh  god 
to be able to finally sit down
with a member of the dynasty 
it s something
we will cherish forever 
and truly   
i understand
how difficult this is 
please don t patronize me 
please 
those words
are not comforting to me 
they make me feel offended
in a way  i must say 
mr  gucci 
i have a plane
that leaves in one hour 
if there is a problem
with the offer   
said and omar 
they re at your disposal 
no  no  no 
 stuttering  we are very
grateful for your offer   
except no 
right  papa 
that shoe you showed me
before   
take a look inside your shoe
and see at the heel 
there s something
you should see 
i remember ordering
a pair of those   
for clark gable 
1953 
right before
he did the film mogambo 
this is the rarest of shoes 
you see that  you see that 
it s a gold leaf 
you know   
i had to stop doing that 
it got too expensive 
so 
where did you get that shoe 
where 
there s no way you bought
that shoe in london 
who gave it to you 
would you know 
my  he doesn t wanna answer 
 paolo 
well  that s the least   
 aldo  this meeting is over 
i broke up the meeting 
where is he going 
 nemir  i m very sorry 
i had no choice 
aldo 
 exclaiming 
did you know this 
no 
no 
maurizio 
you fucking traitor 
 sighs 
 sobs 
this is what you want 
 grunts 
congratulations 
you are now the majority
shareholder   
of gucci 
you must feel wonderful 
boof 
 man  you need to relax 
relax  relax 
you floating 
you floating like in the air 
floating  floating 
from there to there 
go left to right 
 maurizio  ms  wintour  walk into any one
of gucci s 144 international boutiques
and you will find you are
walking into a new world 
a new vision 
but wasn t the lure of gucci
precisely its historical appeal 
the legacy is remarkable 
 maurizio  well  this is true 
we are products of our past but we
don t have to be prisoners of it 
i don t fear change 
i embrace it 
where ralph lauren stores 
they feel like movie sets
and versace
is a rock concert 
gucci stores will feel
like the vatican of fashion 
  ashes to ashes  playing 
grazie 
how are you funding
your vision 
   maurizio  well  that is a very good secret 
   chuckles 
don t ask 
it may take some time
to recover   
but this is a long term plan 
sometimes you have to go down
to come back up again 
ferre  armani  and versace 
that s who i said i wanted
designing our new line 
and they would be honored
to be working for us 
de sole 
where the fuck are they 
maurizio  they have
their own lines 
they re their own bosses 
i know they have   
i ve spoken to everybody 
nobody wants to   
then you haven t tried
hard enough 
there is someone 
maybe 
here 
who am i looking at 
he s from texas 
a mechanic 
maybe you should meet him 
 man  i see cranked up blacks 
jewel tone velvet 
and unconventional
styling touches 
loafers  sans socks 
i see pole dancers
flanking the runways 
female   
and male  of course 
i have a vocabulary that
will allow you to expand 
that s what the brand requires 
that s where we need to head 
without sacrificing the family
character of what this brand is 
the family character
is the brand 
i m here to embellish 
i m here to resurrect 
 chuckles 
 patrizia  maurizio 
stop  please 
please  please 
i m begging you 
please stop 
okay  i    i don t want
a confrontation 
me neither 
i tried calling 
yes  and calling

what do you want 
i want to talk 
 maurizio  okay 
alessandra misses you 
i saw alessandra
two weeks ago

   people chattering

patrizia  what is this

i made it for you 
you re humiliating yourself 
why are you talking to me
this way 
because you can t see
what you ve become 
this book    a story has
a beginning and an end 
and ours ended
a few chapters ago 
so  what do you want
from me now 
i want you to myself 
i love you 
patrizia   
no 
i don t love you 
i don t hate you   
but i don t want to spend
the rest of my life with you

 giuseppina

and then we can

we need something stronger 
maybe i can still do something

 tom ford   when tom ford took over
the creative reins of gucci in 1994   
 there was little hope for
the milanese fashion house  
 it took a german designer
to stir up chanel   
 and it is an american who has put gucci
far and away in the front of fashion  
 some say mr  ford will give
mr  lagerfeld a run for his money  
i have to call my mother
in austin 
 speaking other language 
what an unforgettable night 
maurizio 
and the response
is incredible 
i ve never seen
anything like it 
indeed  it marks
a new chapter for gucci 
hey  try the carpaccio 
it melts in your mouth 
okay 
 speaking other language 
i think we can all be honest with
each other around this table  yeah 
we re all friends here 
we can  we all
respect each other 
 maurizio  grazie 
we re very concerned 
what concerns you 
numbers 
specifically  gucci s 
well  you said you didn t care
about numbers 
that you trusted your instinct 
yeah  i care about numbers
when they re terrible numbers 
our projections for 1996
are abysmal 
by slashing hundreds of
profitable items   
you mean
my uncle s knickknacks 
 man  losses are likely to total
 30 million this year on sales
of  180 million 
down from  210 million in 1991 
and  270 million 
there is  85 million
in bank debts 
we may even have trouble paying
salaries for the next couple of months 
profits remain elusive 
and i ve always said that our
strategic plan would take five years 
it s not about
immediate profit 
you go down
to come back up again 
that is how you get out
of a stall 
but the personal items
are a concern as well 
all paid for through gucci s
accounts and charged as expenses 
the multimillion dollar
antiques in the stores 
the purchase
of countless cars
including a ferrari f40
and a lamborghini countach 
 3 million on a watch 
a patek philippe 2523 
 7 million on
a luxury penthouse 
i could go on and on 
an 18th century palatial villa
outside florence
for use as a training center 
i have justifications
for all of these things
but it doesn t seem that
you re in a place to hear them 
maurizio  please try and take this
in the spirit of our friendship 
we ve been through
a lot together 
you have many qualities 
but we must be realistic 
you re not a natural manager 
you can t run a business purely
on charm and eccentricities 
no  you need time as well 
last night does mark
a new chapter for gucci
and i am the one
that brought it to you 
maurizio  i want you
to understand
whatever happens between
both of our companies 
i have never stopped
respecting you or your vision 
but i have vision
for my people too 
and i have a business to run 
we want to offer you
 150 million
for your 50  stake in gucci 
 chuckles softly 
you want to buy me out 
 domenico 
we want to save the business 
and who would be
appointed ceo 
 chuckles 
she was right about you 
 150 million 
you ll be a rich man 
if you really think
it s about money 
then you know less about gucci
than i thought 
 speaking other language 
 speaking other language 
  excuse me 
  yes 
this meat 
where is it coming from 
this is the finest beef
in tuscany 
it comes from
the val di chiana 
the cows
are treated like royalty 
 sighs 
 door slams shut 
 intense music playing 
 horn blaring incessantly 
 alarm beeping 
that s him
