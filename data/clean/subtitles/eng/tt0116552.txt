like i was saying 
they treat us pretty good here 
three square meals a day 
a warm place
to sleep at night 
and all the smelly sneakers
you can eat

sometimes a dog
can get a little restless 
and every now and then 
i wonder if maybe there isn t
something more out there 
hey  wait  there is something
out there  i can smell it 
boy  mom

place in the entire city 
 chance  really 
 delilah  yeah

chance  well  it s no dumpster
behind mcdonald s 
it s just that
i get enough of this back home 
and to tell you the truth 
it gets kinda dull
after a while 
i mean  ponds and ducks
can only be so exciting 
swim   quack  
swim   quack   boring 
delilah  oh  you  come on 
i ve dreamed of living
in a place like this 
but i guess that s
pretty silly  huh 
chance  are you crazy 
you get to live in the city 
it s the coolest place
in the world 
delilah  chance  stay clear
of those humans 
you can t trust  em 
chance  come on 
what s not to trust 
you re talkin  about
the species that invented
the chili cheeseburger 
they are so tasty 
jamie turned me on to  em 
 delilah  jamie  who s jamie 
 chance  he s my human 
delilah  well  riley says
you can t trust humans 
no matter how friendly
they seem 
chance  i m pretty sure
i could trust jamie 
he rescued me from
the bad place 
he takes me for walks 
he lets me eat off his plate 
 he gave me a home 
 delilah  let me
tell you something 
when riley was a puppy 
he thought he found
a home with humans too 
they tied a ribbon
to his collar   
and they put him in
a big basket underneath a tree 
but the little boy  he didn t
seem to like riley very much 
he didn t want to hold him 
or play with him  or anything 
so later  they drove
into the city
and they left riley
in the gutter
on the coldest 
rainiest night of the year 
so riley found
other abandoned dogs   
and he made a home for them 
to protect them from all humans 
they got rid of riley
just  cause the kid
didn t want to play with him 
huh  jamie s getting
tired of playing with me 
 uh oh 
 you don t think 
i don t know  chance 
all i know is 
i don t trust humans 
and i don t know
any dog that does 
why  what d your
humans do to you 
me  oh  i never had humans 
i was born a stray 
poor delilah  no wonder
she doesn t trust humans 
she s never had any 
she doesn t know how great
it can be havin  a family 
havin  somebody there
to look out for you 
got ya 
delilah  i   
well  i just wanted to tell you
that  uh   
 oh  here

yep  that s right 
an american bulldog 
a golden retriever
and a himalayan cat 
right  right 
i talked to you last night 
no  no reports so far  sir 
what are the chances
of finding these animals 
uh  realistically  one in ten 
i mean 
it s a big city out there 
you got cars and trucks 
trains and trolleys 
there are animal science labs 
other strays 
you got your wackos
