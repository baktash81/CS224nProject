any day he might
come romping back   
just come whistling
back through that door   
and everything
will be the same   
real peachy keen 
  uh huh 
  it s a possibility 
well  at least we

i m real scared  kirby 
are you going
to suck me to death 
  hmph 
  what is it with you 
you act like you just came
off the assembly line 
get this through
your chrome 
we ve been dumped 
abandoned 
  but he loved us 
  that s right 
so what 
he has a family 
they move  he moves 
it s a package deal 
but   
he s not coming back 
pure and simple 
did you talk to him 
they could drive up
any second 
you really think so 
i m not talking to you 
you have a combined wattage
of five  maybe less 
it s been years 
it s scrap metal time 
do what you like 
we re not gonna give up hope 
that s real touching 
you re gonna get me bawling
like a baby any time now 
i think
you re jealous 
sure  i m jealous of
a bunch of dimwits 
  dim 
  yeah 
the master never
played with you 
because you re
stuck in the wall 
so  it s back to that
stupid static again 
you think i don t know
what s going on in here 
i know what goes on
in this cottage 
it s a conspiracy   
and every one of you
low watts is in on it 
just because
you move around   
you think you re
better than i am 
i was designed
to stick in a wall 
i like being stuck
in this stupid wall 
i can t help it   
if the kid was too short
to reach my dials 
we didn t mean it 
really 
it s my function  
don t 
wait  wait 
  he s gonna blow 
  yank the cord 
the fuse 
poor air conditioner 
i didn t know
he d take it so hard 
he was a jerk anyway 
hey  what s that 
what is it 
a car 
not another word
about cars 
you said it 
sounds close 
just don t even start 
sounds real close 
 car door closing 
 hammering 
 humming  taps  
wah  hah  hah 
 humming 
stop it 
we re going out
to find him 
  what 
  what do you mean 
exactly
what i said 
we re gonna go out
and find the master 
to the city 
no matter what 
how would you propose we re
gonna do that  exactly 
i don t know 
come off it 
be serious 
i am serious 
you re insane 
if only we were wiener dogs 
our problems would be solved 
what 
maybe it was
a basset hound 
you re all insane 
it was a news flash
i picked up about a dog 
in an amazing show
of loyalty and courage   
a terrier named grover
traveled hundreds of miles   
to be reunited
with his owner 
the poor critter was
accidentally left behind   
on a fishing trip
three weeks ago 
he had to find his way
across rugged mountains   
and scorching deserts
in order to get home 
little grover turned out
to be one spunky pup 
if a dog can do it 
we can do it 
but a dog has legs 
ah  don t be
a wet blanket 
  legs would help 
  brains wouldn t hurt either 
  lay off 
  pipe down  carpet breath 
i m going 
with or without you 
i say we stay 
we ll have a new master
when someone buys the cottage 
but i don t want
a new master 
i want
our master 
well   
what about the
rest of you 
you boys are gonna
need a leader 
alone  you wouldn t last
for 5 minutes out there 
i used to be
a mountaineer 
together   
we can stand against
the forces of nature 
were you really
a mountaineer 
sure  ask anybody 
ask teddy roosevelt 
we shot moose together
on the klondike 
you know 
i was thinking   
you guys will need
somebody bright along 
  good idea 
  listen to this 
world war ii 
the normandy invasion   
and who dare but lampy
to light the way 
you know   
i thought it would be good
to have somebody come along   
who s really    strong 
  and loud 
  and grumpy 
and oblivious
to reality 
well 
i just know i m going
to regret this 
 cheering 
  yippee 
  hot dog 
wow  this is
our last fuse 
good thing we re
getting out of here

loved travel 
the open road 
the wind in my face

life is like a journey
on the road that s within
head says you should stay
but your heart says to begin
so you go
but you don t
want to go
any life worth living
isn t life just
filled with ease
you just stay forgiving
through the forests
and the trees
and you ll go
just where you want to go
time flies by
in the city of light
time stands still
in the country
there s no time
for a fuss and a fight
as we travel the land
and i d
be satisfied
just to be
not denied
to reside with some pride
while i ride to the city
the city of light
light shines like a diamond
in the city at night
when that
diamond shines
you know that
everything s all right
but you know
we got a way to go
let us meet the master
we don t want
to make him wait
you just keep a knocking
he will open up the gate
to that city of light
master is a man
with a plan i can understand
master is a man
of great reflection
master is a man who lays
his hand across the land
master is a man
of our affection
time flies by
in the city of light
time stands still
in the country
there s no time for
a fuss and a fight
as we travel the land
and i d
be satisfied
just to be
not denied
to reside
with some pride
while i ride
to the city
the city of light
