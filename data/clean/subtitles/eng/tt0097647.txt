just like bonsai
choose own way grow
because the root is strong 
you choose own way 
do karate same reason 
yeah  but i do it your way 
hai  one day  you do own way 
remember what
you said before about
bonsai being free to
grow as they choose 
all bonsai aren t
free to choose 
i mean  we tell them
how to grow
by using clippers
and then the wire 
hai 
but  daniel san 
our bonsai not true bonsai 
true bonsai grow wild 
very rare 
  you ever seen any 
  hai 
okinawa 
what about here 
i only know of one 
what did it do  immigrate 
with miyagi  only thing miyagi
bring from okinawa 
where s the tree now 
there 
devil s cauldron 
  devil s cauldron 
  hai 
no can see bonsai from here 
good place 
very safe  nobody bother 
why did you put it in such
a hard place to get to 
true original bonsai
worth many thousand dollar 
wow 
come  time learn special
miyagi family kata 
now you ready 
like all bonsai found in tree 
all karate found in this kata 
come  together we do kata 
  hi  mr  miyagi 
  hi 
hey  i brought over this tree 
you know  the one you were
working on this morning 
i figured you might want
to give it another try 
oh  thank you 
i thought a change of scenery

where should i put it 
over here  okay 
very good  daniel san 
you ve done a lot of
work here  this place
  is bigger than i thought 
  yeah 
there s your charcoal 
thank you 
oh  perfect 
listen 
i hope you don t mind
but  um   
i opened that letter 
you know  the one that came today
from the all valley tournament 
there s a new rule this year 
would you like
to read about it 
no 
that s okay because
i got it memorized 
it says 
 under the new rules 
 the defending champion
only needs to fight in the final match   
isn t that great 
that s one fight 
that limits my fights
to just one 
that s better than what i
had to put up with last year  right 
hai 
and let s face it 
it s another year 
it s a year later 
i m a lot more experienced  right 
hai 
so i think we should
seriously reconsider this 
  right 
  wrong 
wrong 
should consider get
new pot for bonsai 
you know  i don t know
what the big deal is 
  i mean  what is your problem with this 
  uh uh uh

if karate used defend honor 
defend life

go find a nice pot for
bonsai across street 
oh  here s your pen 
before i forget 
and if you have a minute 
just in case you
change your mind 
here s the application 
okay 
i mean  it s no rush  i mean 
it says at the bottom   
we have a couple of weeks
before we have to send it in 
so  uh

like we had to do it today 
we have some time

ah  daniel san 
we can rebuild the shop 
  cannot rebuild stock 
  yeah but   
we sell a few trees 
fix shoji screen  start over again 
  everything will be okay 
  yeah  but   
what if those
guys come back again 
what are we going to do then 
if they come back 
what are we going to do 
just tell me 
what do we do if they come back 
sing happy song 
where are the trees 
where d you put the trees 
they stole them 
they stole them 
i can t believe it 
they stole the trees  don t they get it 
i m not going to
sign this thing 
mr  miyagi  what are we going to do 
how we    where are you going 
get fishing pole 
what 
sometimes i don t get you 
the shop s wrecked 
we ve just been robbed 
and you re
going fishing  huh 
we re flat broke and
you re going fishing 
you re just going
to fluff it off 
doesn t this even bother you 
daniel san 
sometime better be bothered
on full stomach
than empty one 
ah  great  another great thought  huh 
that really does me good 
you go fishing  i m gonna
do something about this 
i m going to
the police to report it 
show them the application so
they can arrest these jerks 
this is the  80s  you gotta
do something  mr  miyagi 
you can t be so damn passive 
somebody s gotta do something
about these guys 
and then i bring the tournament
application to the police station 
but as i walk in 
they all start laughing at me 
then finally
the sergeant said   son  we ll look into it   
  so  we ll see  i hope 
  yeah 
well  i still kinda think you should ask
mr  miyagi before going after his tree 
he wouldn t think he d hide it
out in the middle of nowhere
if he wanted people
digging it up  you know 
look  i don t have a choice 
if mr  miyagi doesn t sell this tree
we re looking for 
he loses his business 
he s broke 
his social security
can barely cover
the expenses on his rowboat 
i mean  this tree is like
money in the bank 
great  so now we re
robbing a bank 
so  how much do you
think this thing is worth 
i checked around 
i found out
  these original bonsai trees   
  uh huh 
they start at  10 000 
no  way  seriously 
see  that s why it s
so important to me 
this one tree can set
mr  miyagi up for life 
that s the least
i could do for him 
wow 
it s a long way down there 
you know
what i think 
what 
i think when
the tide comes in 
the ocean fills up
the bottom down there 
yeah  mr  miyagi sure knows
how to pick  em 
yeah  no kidding 
i mean  how are we supposed
to find mr  miyagi s tiny little tree in all this 
well  he told me he
put it halfway down
the steepest cliff 
where it would catch the first rays of the sun 
okay  good luck 
we re never gonna find it 
wait  that s it 
that must be it  i found it 
  are you sure 
  yeah  oh god 
it s beautiful 
it s like the one on the back of my gi 
  come on  let me see

and if it s not too much trouble 
i d like to take you up on it 
i mean  you know 
just on a short term basis 
oh  trouble  are you kidding 
it d be an honor 
how does mr  miyagi
feel about it 
well  mr  miyagi  he  uh   
he doesn t   
he doesn t need to know about it  if   
but he knows you re competing 
yeah  he knows that 
he just  he doesn t approve 
well  everybody has
a right to his opinion 
look  i won t say anything 
thanks 
so  when do you want to start 
no  i mean  that s up to you 
whenever it s   
oh  hey  i got a gi
hanging in the closet  i think it ll fit 
what do you say
we go right now 
now 
one more 
good  catch your breath 
come on over here 
you re better than i thought 
you re ready to move on 
mr  larusso 
you re ready to move on 
there are three things
that make a champion 
the three d s 
desire  devotion and discipline 
the first two
i can t give you 
the last one i can 
but you have to be willing to receive it 
are you  mr  larusso 
sure  sure 
the response
you re looking for is   yes  sir   
right  yes  sir  i m sorry 
that s okay 
stand up straight 
now  over the years i ve developed a system
of intensive short term training
for situations just like this 
it comes in two parts
and has three rules 
i call it  quick silver   
that s good 
you like that  huh 
rule number one 
a man can t stand 
he can t fight 
repeat it 
a man can t stand 
he can t fight 
with conviction  mr  larusso 
a man can t stand 
he can t fight 
good  all right 
imagine these
two by fours are legs  sweep them 
what are you   
that s too low 
any higher it d be
like hitting the knee  right 
did you come here
to teach or to be taught 
we re not sweeping
floors here  harder 
come on  put your
hip into it  that s where the power is 
right 
that s it  harder 
harder 
ow 
ow 
 ow  is not an acceptable
kiai in this dojo  mr  larusso 
well isn t this a little bit extreme  sir 
i mean  come on 
extreme situations
require extreme measures 
now  you come back tomorrow 
we ll start again 
you did good for
your first day 
thanks 
hey 
i really appreciate
all your help 
thanks again 
you re welcome 
who is it 
miyagi 
hey  mr  miyagi  uh   
why don t you come in 
just catching up on
some sit ups here 
you know  it s not easy
when you re training yourself 
daniel san 
what happened foot 
what foot 
wow  look at that 
i don t know 
maybe i banged it in my sleep 
i don t remember  i just   
what s that 
you soak foot 
be better tomorrow 
why  you got a new
foot in there for me 
no  next best thing 
new foot powder 
smells like old foot powder 
what s in there 
better you don t know 
give me foot 
ow  it s hot 
hot  hot   
good 
daniel san  maybe tomorrow
you remember what happened foot 
then you tell miyagi 
tomorrow  no 
i have so many things to do tomorrow 
tomorrow  i m busy  tomorrow is  uh 
tomorrow is a bad day 
i mean  in the morning  i m supposed to  uh 
in the afternoon  i m supposed to meet with a
buddy of mine i haven t seen since  uh 
since we got back 
you know  from okinawa 
what am i doing 
what am i doing 
hope confusion end soon 
daniel san 
miyagi heart empty
without you 
the bruise on
your foot is gone 
that s good 
you re a fast healer 
all right  let s go 
that s a nice little move 
mr  miyagi teach you that 
uh huh  no 
no  i didn t think so 
what was the last thing
mr  miyagi taught you 
uh  we did kata 
  kata 
  yeah 
kata is good for working up a sweat 
it s not gonna win the tournament 
come on over here 
hold the bag 
rule number two
of the  quick silver  method 
a man can t breathe 
he can t fight 
now 
imagine this is the enemy 
these are his ribs 
behind them his lungs 
  you got it 
  yeah 
good  you try it 
no  wait a minute 
let s do it over here 
  where 
  right here  his ribs 
lay into him 
why do i have to do
this with this thing 
because it s a part
of the training 
because i m teaching you
techniques you don t have 
techniques you need
to win the tournament 
what  do you think
you can rely on that crane crap 
i did pretty well
with it last time 
hey 
wake up and smell the coffee 
mr  larusso 
last time
you weren t fighting this 
you don t get it  do you 
you want to get beaten because of a little
pain  be my guest  i can t be a part of that 
i make wimps into winners 
not the other way around 
christ  i m wasting my time 
  yeah 
  miyagi 
damn it 
could you come back later 
daniel san  why are you doing
this to yourself 
doing what 
what you doing 
because mr  miyagi 
extreme situations
require extreme measures  okay 
oh  daniel san 
that not sound
like you talking 
well  it is me talking  all right 
look  i m sorry if
you don t like it  but i got problems
and if you re not gonna be
part of the solution 
just don t give me
a hard time about it  all right 
okay  you got it 
what are you
wasting your time with kata for 
didn t i tell you
it s useless in a tournament  huh 
  yes  sir 
  yes  sir 
yes  sir 
you re right  i m sorry 
all right  come over here 
let s get back to learning
something that can do some real damage 
rule number three 
a man can t see 
he can t fight 
if you hit him
square in the nose
he ll be blinded
by his tears and choke on his own blood 
here s how it works 
you wait until your man is
attacking and when he s close enough   
but that would be face contact 
i d be disqualified 
that doesn t   
he ran into your fist 
not your fault  right 
right 
he can t continue 
that means you win 
  you like that  mr  larusso 
  i like that 
good  give it a shot 
let s try it over here
on your friend 
reverse punch 
visualise 
this isn t a bunch of sticks
and pipes anymore 
this is a living  breathing
fighting machine that wants to detach
your head from
the rest of your body 
it s blood  so what 
make believe it s his 
this guy wants to break you 
humiliate you 
stomp you into the ground
