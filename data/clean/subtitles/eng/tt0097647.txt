up here right
to do like a bonsai display
all those pine trees you have
we could show them in different stages
i mean the possibilities
are endless its endless
here hold the lease
listen over here right
i thought this would
be a great spot
for a little work area
and over here we could have
like a bonsai hospital

inside
inside
hello any bonsai in here
danielsan not inside
inside you
same place your
karate come from
but my karate comes from you
only root karate
come from miyagi
just like bonsai
choose own way grow
because the root is strong
you choose own way
do karate same reason
yeah but i do it your way
hai one day you do own way
remember what
you said before about
bonsai being free to
grow as they choose
all bonsai arent
free to choose
i mean we tell them
how to grow
by using clippers
and then the wire
hai
but danielsan
our bonsai not true bonsai
true bonsai grow wild
very rare
you ever seen any
hai

over here okay
very good danielsan
youve done a lot of
work here this place
is bigger than i thought
yeah
theres your charcoal
thank you
oh perfect
listen
i hope you dont mind
but um
i opened that letter
you know the one that came today
from the all valley tournament
theres a new rule this year
would you like
to read about it
no
thats okay because
i got it memorized
it says
under the new rules
the defending champion
only needs to fight in the final match
isnt that great
thats one fight
that limits my fights
to just one
thats better than what i
had to put up with last year right
hai
and lets face it
its another year
its a year later
im a lot more experienced right
hai
so i think we should
seriously reconsider this
right
wrong
wrong
should consider get
new pot for bonsai
you know i dont know
what the big deal is
i mean what is your problem with this
uhuhuh
danielsan
if karate used defend honor
defend life
karate means something

sometimes i dont get you
the shops wrecked
weve just been robbed
and youre
going fishing huh
were flat broke and
youre going fishing
youre just going
to fluff it off
doesnt this even bother you
danielsan
sometime better be bothered
on full stomach
than empty one
ah great another great thought huh
that really does me good
you go fishing im gonna
do something about this
im going to
the police to report it
show them the application so
they can arrest these jerks
this is the 80s you gotta
do something mr miyagi
you cant be so damn passive
somebodys gotta do something
about these guys
and then i bring the tournament
application to the police station
but as i walk in
they all start laughing at me
then finally
the sergeant said son well look into it
so well see i hope
yeah
well i still kinda think you should ask
mr miyagi before going after his tree
he wouldnt think hed hide it
out in the middle of nowhere
if he wanted people
digging it up you know
look i dont have a choice
if mr miyagi doesnt sell this tree
were looking for
he loses his business
hes broke
his social security
can barely cover
the expenses on his rowboat
i mean this tree is like
money in the bank
great so now were
robbing a bank
so how much do you
think this thing is worth
i checked around
i found out
these original bonsai trees
uhhuh
they start at 10000
no way seriously
see thats why its
so important to me
this one tree can set
mr miyagi up for life
thats the least
i could do for him
wow
its a long way down there
you know
what i think
what
i think when
the tide comes in
the ocean fills up
the bottom down there
yeah mr miyagi sure knows
how to pick em
yeah no kidding

what do you say
we go right now
now
one more
good catch your breath
come on over here
youre better than i thought
youre ready to move on
mr larusso
youre ready to move on
there are three things
that make a champion
the three ds
desire devotion and discipline
the first two
i cant give you
the last one i can
but you have to be willing to receive it
are you mr larusso
sure sure
the response
youre looking for is yes sir
right yes sir im sorry
thats okay
stand up straight
now over the years ive developed a system
of intensive shortterm training
for situations just like this
it comes in two parts
and has three rules
i call it quick silver
thats good
you like that huh
rule number one
a man cant stand
he cant fight
repeat it
a man cant stand
he cant fight
with conviction mr larusso
a man cant stand
he cant fight
good all right
imagine these
twobyfours are legs sweep them
what are you
thats too low
any higher itd be
like hitting the knee right
did you come here
to teach or to be taught
were not sweeping
floors here harder
come on put your
hip into it thats where the power is
right
thats it harder
harder
ow
ow
ow is not an acceptable
kiai in this dojo mr larusso
well isnt this a little bit extreme sir
i mean come on
extreme situations
require extreme measures
now you come back tomorrow
well start again
you did good for
your first day
thanks
hey
i really appreciate
all your help
thanks again
youre welcome
who is it
miyagi
hey mr miyagi uh
why dont you come in
just catching up on
some situps here
you know its not easy
when youre training yourself
danielsan
what happened foot
what foot
wow look at that
i dont know
maybe i banged it in my sleep
i dont remember i just
whats that
you soak foot
be better tomorrow
why you got a new
foot in there for me
no next best thing
new foot powder
smells like old foot powder
whats in there
better you dont know
give me foot
ow its hot
hot hot
good
danielsan maybe tomorrow
you remember what happened foot
then you tell miyagi
tomorrow no
i have so many things to do tomorrow
tomorrow im busy tomorrow is uh
tomorrow is a bad day
i mean in the morning im supposed to uh
in the afternoon im supposed to meet with a
buddy of mine i havent seen since uh
since we got back
you know from okinawa
what am i doing
what am i doing
hope confusion end soon
danielsan
miyagi heart empty
without you
the bruise on
your foot is gone
thats good
youre a fast healer
all right lets go
thats a nice little move
mr miyagi teach you that
uhhuh no
no i didnt think so
what was the last thing
mr miyagi taught you
uh we did kata
kata
yeah
kata is good for working up a sweat
its not gonna win the tournament
come on over here
hold the bag
rule number two
of the quick silver method
a man cant breathe
he cant fight
now
imagine this is the enemy
these are his ribs
behind them his lungs
you got it
yeah
good you try it
no wait a minute
lets do it over here
where
right here his ribs
lay into him
why do i have to do
this with this thing
because its a part
of the training
because im teaching you
techniques you dont have
techniques you need
to win the tournament
what do you think
you can rely on that crane crap
i did pretty well
with it last time
hey
wake up and smell the coffee
mr larusso
last time
you werent fighting this
you dont get it do you
you want to get beaten because of a little
pain be my guest i cant be a part of that
i make wimps into winners
not the other way around
christ im wasting my time
yeah
miyagi
damn it
could you come back later
danielsan why are you doing
this to yourself
doing what
what you doing
because mr miyagi
extreme situations
require extreme measures okay
oh danielsan
that not sound
like you talking
well it is me talking all right
look im sorry if
you dont like it but i got problems
and if youre not gonna be
part of the solution
just dont give me
a hard time about it all right
okay you got it
what are you
wasting your time with kata for
didnt i tell you
its useless in a tournament huh
yes sir
yes sir
yes sir
youre right im sorry
all right come over here
lets get back to learning
something that can do some real damage
rule number three
a man cant see
he cant fight
if you hit him
square in the nose
hell be blinded
by his tears and choke on his own blood
heres how it works
you wait until your man is
attacking and when hes close enough
but that would be face contact
id be disqualified
that doesnt
he ran into your fist
not your fault right
right
he cant continue
that means you win
you like that mr larusso
i like that
good give it a shot
lets try it over here
on your friend
reverse punch
visualise
this isnt a bunch of sticks
and pipes anymore
this is a living breathing
fighting machine that wants to detach
your head from
the rest of your body
its blood so what
make believe its his
this guy wants to break you
humiliate you
stomp you into the ground
