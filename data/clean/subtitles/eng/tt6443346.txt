the first selfgoverning people on earth
kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment
for centuries they thrived
but then
came king ahkton
using the army to seize power
ahkton became a tyrant
but he had even darker ambitions
obsessed with dark magic
ahktons real goal
was to forge the crown of sabbac
if infused with the powers
of the six demons of the ancient world
it would make ahkton invincible
to make the crown he needed eternium
a rare mineral of magic properties
found only in kahndaq
so he enslaved his own people
and forced them to dig
eternium
eternium
eternium
kahndaq was teetering on the brink
what they needed
get off him
get off him
was a hero
why are we fighting each other
remember who our real enemy is
come with me
look eternium
let me see that
the king thanks you
hes supposed to reward him
is that right
i want what im owed
you want a reward
the king thanks you for your service
you want the kings reward too
no but my son accepts the kings mercy
i wont always be here to protect you
i dont need protection
i want to be free
if we fight together
we could overthrow the king
let someone else be the hero
the graveyards are full of them
stop dreaming and go back to work
someone to hold the hopes of the people
even when all hope seems lost
if we had more heroes
then maybe our freedom wouldnt be a dream
freedom
king ahkton knew that this spark
could quickley ignite a fire
and so he ordered that it be snuffed out
they thought they were getting a martyr
instead
they got a miracle
the council of wizards
the magical guardians of the earth
you have been chosen
sought to restore the balance
they empowered him with the gifts
of the ancient gods
and turned a boy
into a champion
shazam
hurry
give it to me
but the crown had already been completed
give it to me
and when the champion arrived
at the palace to challange him
king ahkton summoned
its demonic power
in the ensuing battle
the palace was destroyed
but the champion was victorious
the wizards hid the crown of sabbac
so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man
and the champion
was never heard from again
khandaq present day
today kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries
the intergang the latest
in a series of foreign invaders
but legend says
whenever kahndaq needs him most
the champion will return
to restore freedom to the people
it has been a long long wait
show me your papers
intergang checkpoint
sector 5  north shiruta
have your documentation ready
its all our three documents yeah
dont judge the picture
its after my girlfriend broke up with me
open the back need a look inside
yeah its unlocked man

and make us wait in lines all day
hey boss man can i go

lets just move the crown first
and then we can worry about safe
i got intergang watching my house
i gave up my job at the university
and moved four times
it doesnt mean
im gonna abandon my country
im just saying
no one stays a step ahead of them forever
we cant wait for things
to cool down this time
if im right
theyre days away from finding it
what are you doing
i want to come with you

you guys should get some rest
i thought intergang
seized all the old relics
hey come on stop it
im just curious how she got it
my grandmother gave it to me
how did she get it
its not a museum piece
its a family heirloom
going all the way back to the days
when kahndaq was free
you happy now
cool story
and all i inherited was a sweater
thats not true
baba left you his van and his bald spot
you know some women like a bald spot
curly on the outside
smooth on the inside you know
are you sure about this
the inscrptions we found are clear
and im positive about that translation
there is something inside that mountain
what if it really is the crown then what
its a source of great power
who gets to keep it
no one we hide it again someplace else
get it out of the country if we have to
it is too dangerous for anyone to have
this is it
not yet
are you coming
bad knee ill keep watch
this way almost there
men were given the gift of magic
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted
keep reading
the ultimate power was banished
from the earth and hidden here
until now
this mountain has kept
the crown of sabbac safe for 5000 years
were 100 percent totally no takebacks
certain that we want to move it
we dont have a choice
what happened to ishmael
great dont worry ill find him
samir
samir what happened

i cant hear you what are you saying
dont move
unless you want to join your mate
stay where you are
oh hey oh hey hey
turn back
thats what it says no
yes
where is samir
claustrophobic needed some air
is this the way to the crown
i think so
its a tomb
speak not his power
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep
for all eternity teth adam
the slave who became champion
and defeated the king
the legend was true
kahndaq really did have a hero once
if he was such a hero
whyd they bury him down here
the crown

reports of an eternium blast
it is unknown who or why

i promise
they seem green
thats why i called in kent
кents been out of action
for a little while
but i cant do this without him
takes magic to fight magic
and the mans got nearly godlevel powers
it might take a lot than that
are you sure they can take him
waller you find us a cell
that can hold him
well take care of the rest
good luck
this is gonna be fun
were here sir
oh right
was i staring again
only half an hour or so sir
maybe next time honk the horn
of course sir
hawkmans estate
saint roch louisiana
so whats the op
were headed to kahndaq to
apprehend and contain
a classa rogue metahuman
i didnt bring passport
we dont need passports
were the justice society
is this entirely made out of nth metal
everyting down to the screws
completely indestructible
ill be in the cockpit if you need me
its pretty cool you got any snacks
it takes a lot of energy to smash atoms
here
oh thanks
im al by the way
мaxine
what do you do
wind you
i grow
сool
whoa
dont worry about that
i can get another one
my moms not much of a doctor
but you should probably leave th
or do that
i know you have a lot to catch up on
but i was thinking
we could help each other
мove
im amon by the way
i didnt ask for your name
youre teth adam right
everyone in kahndaq knows your story
i said move
my mom said you took out a bunch
of intergang soldiers in the desert
because they wouldnt move out of my way
so you can really fly and stop bullets
cause thats really crucial to my plan
and is it really you stopping the bullets
or is it the suit
wait whats your top speed
im sure youre fast but how fast
like flash fast
wait did you not have
mirrors back then
wow i guess a lot does change
in 5000 years
five thousand years
yeah thats how long
you were in the tomb
until my mom woke you up
so youve got stopping bullets check
flying check
and lighting thing thats a big check
i dont know this place
this is your home
then my home is gone
what happened to the crown
too much
you know its cursed with demons right
life is the only path to death
no shit
teth adam was a bronze age
kahndaqi demigod
he defeated king ahkton
in approximately 2600 bc
there thats you see
thats the statue they built of you
and now youre back
our countrys been oppressed
by one invader
after another over since you left
my point is kahndaq still isnt free
we could really use a superhero
right about now
im no hero
what
superman batman aquaman
youre way more stacked than any of them
and theyre not coming
to kahndaq to save us
but you could stop intergang
all by yourself
just like you did king ahkton
youre our only hope
wizards
i can fix it dont worry
im not a wizard
hey mom hes awake
i told you not to go in your room
it was you who spoke
you woke me
i didnt have a choice
id be dead if it hadnt worked
the men in my tomb
they were your enemies
then your enemies are vanquished
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned
actually we still have a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing
then destroy them
intergang have guns and flybikes
and eternium rockets
we have my mom
prove your strength
destroy your enemy and all he cares about
make him beg for mercy
but deny it until his final breath
interesting okay
i appreciate what you did to for me
but i do not
want you teaching my son violence
i understand
you want his father to teach him violence
gross thats my brother
thats my sister
his fathers dead
im sorry
who do you want
to teach him violence then
yeah mom
who do you want to teach me violence
no one
i want a champion
to help free kahndaq from intergang
please help us
wait wait
where are you going
i shouldnt be here
you dont feel any loyalty to us at all
not really no
youre not seeing
the full possibilities here
i dont know what is was like
in ancient times
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal in our world
maybe clean up your outfit a little bit
get a cape change your name
teth adam is a very strong name
its a little outdated
and you definitely need a catchphrase
something blackout badass to say
right before you absolutely
cook some dude
i dont waste words on the dead
well yeah kind of like that
but more catchy
i was thinking like
tell them the man in the black sent you
them
you know gods demons
whoevers waiting for us in the afterlife
and you wear a lot of black
so we should really lean into that
my point is you could be famous
magazines lunch boxes video games
and the superhero industrial complex
is worth a lot of money
i dont need a box for my lunch
anyone youve ever known is dead
what else are you gonna do
wait where are you going
wallers file needs a bit to be desired
most of this was considered a myth
until yesterday afternoon
hes a bad man kent
what else do you need to know
when youve seen
as many different futures as i have
you cease to believe in absolutes
what are you laughing at
im not laughing that was a smirk
i know thats how you laugh
ive missed having you around
to spout old cryptic shit like that
almost as much as ive missed
having you around to ignore all my advice
carter
this is not a very good plan
yeah well
a bad plan is better than no plan at all
if only there were a third option
i wouldnt touch that if i was you
why not
cause that helmet is from another planet
its millions of years old
it chooses who it lets touch it
like kent
yeah
like kent is leterally possessed
when he puts it on
what happens if i touch it anyway
soul crushing terror or something
so we should probably
put a towel on it right
coming up on it
ready stations in five
hey why is this adam dude so pissed off
hes not some dude
hes a weapon of mass destruction
you dont have to raise your hand
question if hes so powerful
how are we supposed to stop him
if we can get him to say the word
shazam
teth adam will lose his power
and were hoping since hes had
a few thousand years to sleep it off
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence
from the footage you showed us
he doesnt really seem
like a peacefully negotiate kind of guy
correct
look alive
were here
entering kahndaqi airspace
forgive me
this is a message
for all intergang soldiers
kahndaq has its own
official superhero now
тeth adam
please
there he is move
тeth adam
move
тeth adam
whos gonna save you now mate
the statue
thats my son
hes just a boy
he doesnt know what hes doing
what are you doing
hang on i recognize you
where is the crown
lets go
you couldve showed up a bit sooner
but that was dope
we need backup down here
tell them the man in black sent you
well yes but not to me
say it to the bad guys
but before you zap them
catchphrase then kill
yes
hes here
you sense his presence
no
i assume hes the only person
in kahndaq that can do that
fate and ill take the lead listen
now you two hang back til we call you
were the anvil youre the hammer
youre ready
he just dropped the
shit
be prepared
behind you
let us be
i dont know their crimes
but whatever they are
these men should face due process
then let the gods make their judgment
yeah
yeah
you dont look like an intergang
were the justice society
our mission is to protect
global stability
were here to restore peace to kahndaq
and we will use force if necessary
force is always necessary
teth adam
we know who you are
and what you are capable of
theres no place for you
in the world of man
you have two choices kneel or die
i was a slave until i died
then i was reborn a god
i kneel before no one
fate give me a distraction
just say shazam we all go home
i dont have a home
look at that suit its cool
thanks you too
thank you it was a handmedown
it was from my uncle
hawkman just does not give up does he
nope
amon where are you going wait
to help him
cyclone smasher now is your time
lets roll
what are you doing hey
no
ill be right there
you have the crown of sabbac
i cant hold him much longer
move
im coming
im zeroing in on your location
i got him guys i got him
its me al
in case you didnt recognize me
theres something different about you
cant quite put my finger on it
you know its probably because
im six stories tall now
but you youre like a tornado
i thought the two of you did great work
first time out bravo
thanks i mean
i got a little turned around back there
but it all worked out right
youre damn right it did
lets hope waller
has that cell ready for him
you want me to keep my hand here right
youd better not let him up
what do i do guys
long live the champion
long live the champion
long live the champion
long live the champion
yeah hes definitely still breathing
long live the champion
long live the champion
where are you going
we need to go after him
were not strong enough
oh well maybe next time
use your powers of prediction
to figure that out
before we gor our asses kicked
im working on it
miss
excuse me you mind if i look in your bag
yes i do mind
where are you going with this kent
shes got the crown of sabbac
one catastrophe at a time
we cant give him a chance to regroup
hes been spotted entering the palace
it safe to say
hes not going there to surrender
why do you want teth adam to surrender
hes the champion of kahndaq who are you
the justice society
we have been living under
military occupation for 27 years
and never seen you before
you didnt come when intergang
invaded our country
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband
but now we finally have our own hero
and you decide to fly down here
and save us
thank you but were covered
go and protect inernational stability
someplace else
oh and second i dont have the crown
let me spell it out for you
teth adam cant be kahndaqs champion
because he is not a hero
tell that
to all the people he just liberated
i know what this looks like i do
but i can assure you that my t
i am so sorry was that expensive
me and you
when we get back to the ship
yes sir
me and you
i
can we please just see the crown
i dont have it
we dont have time for this
teth adam first then the crown
you dont have any authority here
teth adam has done nothing
teth adam is not who you think he is
and how whould you know
we have access to ancient texts
that have been kept secret for centuries
and what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say
they say that his rage
nearly destroyed kahndaq
and we flew all the way over here
to stop it from happening again
you want to go in there alone
are you sure
you want to go in and fight
teth adam again be my guest
but if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully
without destroying the rest of my city
im your only shot
you brought the invaders with you
they only want to talk
they can talk i wont listen
when i was a little girl
my grandmother told me the story
of how the champion came
to this exact spot
to free the enslaved people of kahndaq
by defeating king ahkton in battle
but according to the justice society
thats not really what happened
they say that you didnt come here
to seek justice
hurry
give it to me
that you came to exact revenge
and in your anger
dont kill me
i can give you anything you want
this is what i want
your power grew
until it became uncontrollable
and the council of wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy
of the gifts that you were granted
we have chosen recklessly
and humanity has paid the price
and now teth adam
you must pay
it wasnt your tomb that i opened was it
it was your prison
and now theres a statue of you
out of the hope that someday
kahndaqs champion would return
but its built on a lie isnt it
i never said i was a hero
i never claimed to be anything
you may not have been a hero
but that doesnt mean
that you cant be one now
i will hear them out
but if they choose to fight
they choose to die
uncle karim
i cant believe youre sitting around
watching tv
when the most epic day ever is
in here little man
ishmael my mom said
you got buried in the tomb
funny story he didnt
wheres adrianna
shes back at the square
we should go bail her out right now
but shes the one who sent me home
to make sure the crowns safe
it is safe okay somewhere else
definitely not here let okay
put the bag down
what are you doing
back away put the bag down now
give him the bag give hime the bag
very good back away
back away
oké im
its all going to be okay little man
let me teach you some history
that youve never learned
in one of your mothers classes
when we had a powerful king
kahndaq used to be something
much better than free
it used to be great
run amon run
crash the building
i lost the kid he has the crown
were here to negotoiate the terms
of your peaceful surrender
im not peaceful nor do i surrender
what have your powers ever given to you
nothing but heartache
you have no idea
then why are you making this hard on us
we both know
youre not supposed to be here
it is you who is not supposed to be here
i want you all to leave
kahndaq and never return
gladly with you as our prisoner
how bout i rip
you little wings off instead
id like to see you try
okay more fighting wont solve this
i disagree
me too
looks like we found common ground
this can only end one way
мom
amon
i got home and ishmael was in the kitchen
ishmaels dead
no he shot uncle karim
and hes after the crown
ground forces
im hiding in our building
and intergangs here
theyre coming
intergang are after my son
they dont want him
they want the crown of sabbac
i know youre not a hero
but youre not a monster either
i dont care what anyone says
you saved me in that cave
you didnt know me
and your first instinct was to save me
im begging you please save my son
check the whole place clean
cover all access points
keep looking
areas clear
there take him
right there right there
shit
move move
dont shoot him i need him
end of the road kid

but maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time
оh and remember your catchphrase
time to go amon
wheres the crown
what crown
you want to be brave eh
i want you to go to hell
thats the plan little man
weer gonna go for a ride come one
put me down put me down
you should really be more careful

and tell them that the man in black
hes right behind me
where the hell is everybody
mom

whoa slow down

engine failure
hey careful dude i almost hit you
i am so sorry
i dont really have peripheral vision
in the mask its my uncles
ill get it tailored
me and you
roger that
who are you
call me dr fate
how bad is it doc am i dying
im not that kind of doctor
but dont worry i can see the future
this isnt how youre going to die
how do i die then
just stay away from electricity
wait what im an electrician
how the hell am i supposed to do that
over speed
eternium levels critical
oh god
the champions coming for you
you know that right
im counting on it
please dont
teth adam where are you
you followed me
my mind and body can exist
in different places at the same time
did you find the boy
caught one of the bikes
but he didnt have the child
bring me the prisoner
ill break his mind
you killed him didnt you
he didnt make it
the bullets extracted
the tissue damage has been repaired
blood pressure 120 over 81
heart rates at 74 bpm
hell be back on his feet in no time
that is insane
the nanobots did most of the work
no no no
im not gonna let you downplay this
i literally just witnessed a miracle
what i say something stupid
no its just that you can transform
your molecular structure
grow a hundred times your own size
youre an impossibility
and the world still amazes you
i dont know its its cool
thank you
but its not as cool as nanobots
thats how you do your wind thing
well the wind thing
is called aerokinesis
and the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream
by this really messedup scientist
who kidnapped me when i was 15
im so sorry
no youre good
it seems like you really turned it around
found your calling
hoping this is mine
theres no point in dwelling in the past
its already moved on from you
why did you say that
you were blaming yourself
for trusting ishmael
your thoughts are beter spent
on the things you can change
not those you cant
you see the future
tell me how i get my son back
by trusting us
karim will live we will save amon
its what we do
i suppose they didnt have doors
in your day
well of course we did
thats how we entered rooms
what i did there is called sarcasm
wheres amon did you found him
not yet but i will
the men who took him will suffer
maybe these guys can help
theres an upside to keeping prisoners
they can answer our questions
what did you do with my son
adrianna adrianna
ive learned that in this modern world
we shouldnt hurt our prisoners
we should treat them
with dignity respect
no
lets start with just one simple question
can either of you fly
shit
i think ill sit this one out
tell me what you did with amon
youd better not drop those prisoners
im not going to drop them
im going to drop one of them
whoever ansers first lives where is he
i dont know
hes at our mine in the desert
i can show
oh you gotta be kidding me
you said you wouldnt hurt the prisoners
that was sarcasm
no technically it was just a lie
intergang have a mine in the desert
amon is there
i know it
its near the al hadidiyah mountains
lets go
i told you stop killing people
they look alive to me
because i saved them
well thats why i waited
until you were there
i got the information i needed
no one died
i did it your way
he does have a point
i know it got lost in all the confusing
but we still have some issues
to settle here
we know where amon is we have to go
theres no we here
there are only heroes
and there are villains
you think yourself a hero
but you would let these criminals go free
knowing that many more will suffer
at their hands unless we end them now
heroes dont kill people
well i do
here we go
is that what i think it is
23 pounds of pure ethernium
much denser than typical artifacts
of the period
king must have had a really strong neck
no it snapped when i killed him
whats that
theres writing on the inside of the rim
life is the only path to death
thats what it says
life is the only path to death
well thats surprisingly obvious
could it have another meaning
what if it means like
life is short
you gotta hold on to what you love
stop
deep
it doesnt matter what it means
it should be buried under the ocean
for eternity
thats not far from what we had in mind
for you when this is over
or i could bury you with it
we cant get rid of it now
its the one thing that intergang wants
believe me i know more than anyone
what this crown is capable of
but we have to keep it
until my son is safe
adrianna
trust me we will get your son back
they dont care about him
they just want to defeat me
hand it over
we cant risk letting this crown fall
into the wrong hands
we will find another way
no
you like to split the world
into good and bad
but thats easy to do
when youre the one drawing the line
all i care about is amon
and until he is safe
were all on the same side
and you you will work together
set a course
for the al hadidiyah mountains
well go in at dawn
i hope you can be a team player
i love teams
that was sarcasm again yes
very much so
good just checking
a wise man once told me
a bad plan is better than no plan at all
that was before we had a very bad plan
let it go
id rather be fighting with him
than against him
hes a murderer kent
if he turns on us
that kid is as good as dead
you dont get to decide who lives or dies
thats up to fate
whats the helmet telling you
somebodys gonna die
who is it atom smasher
its atom smasher
surprisingly no
is it me
when its time for you and i
to say goodbye youll know
all i can tell you is
there is still time to change the future
lets use it
well i guess were sticking
with a very bad plan
al hadidiyah mine
intergang controlled operation
the al hadidiyah mine
is intergangs most valued asset
im gonna land us right here
cut off their access to reinforcements
but the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress
there is only one way in one way out
well be an easy target
for their flybike patrol
communication is key
we keep in step or we get outflanked
we move through the mine inch by inch
until we find amon
this is where you come in
are you ready damn it
or we could just do that
pure eternium shield
unbreakable even with your powers
amon
you hurt him i will kill all of you
nobody has to die we just want the crown
we dont have it
believe me
nothing good will come from that crown
no crown no negotiation
i have it
its right here
release my son you can have it
what do you think youre doing
intergang killed my husband
im not letting them take my son too
not your son not your country
not your decision to make
stop there
its okay nothing is gonna happen to you
hand it over now
im sorry mama
no
now let amon go
i thank you
and i thanks your friends for returning
this crown to its rightful owner
what kind of champion of kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders
you have what you want
let him go
ishmael what are you doing
taking back whats mine
im the last living descendant
of king ahkton the great
and you have just given me
everything i need to become the next
king of kahndaq
my family passed the knowledge on
you know one to the next
this crown crafted by our ancestors
stolen by the wizards and hidden away
but still a source of great power
if only we can wield it
they say when hurut died
you wept like a baby
i wonder if youll do the same for them
please ishmael
sorry amon
fate get ready
death is the only path to life
amon
amon
hes alive
but we need to get him to the medical bay
where is he shot
it wasnt a bullet
it was me
come
were going with you
just find the crown
get it on the cruiser
i found the crown but its not alone
how long we gonna keep doing this
theres no point in fighting
we both know no one can stop me
youre right
only you can
ishmael said you cried when hurut died
whos hurut
hurut was a true champion of kahndaq
and he was also my son
i wont always be here to protect you
i dont need protection
i want to be free
freedom is for the birds
let someone else be the hero
the graveyards are full of them
i tried to protect him
but i wasnt strong enough
shazam
the wizards decided
that he would be their champion
but after the champions many victories
the king went after
what hurut loved the most
our family
hold on father
stay with me
with my powers
youll be safe
i couldnt protect your mother
repeat what i say
shazam
shazam
instead of battling the king
instead of saving kahndaq
hurut chose to save
me
but he couldnt save himself
from the kings assassins
the powers were not a gift
from the wizards
but a curse
born out of rage
the statue of the champion isnt you
its hurut
my son dreamt of a better world
thats why he saved me
but the world was only a better place
with him in it
kahndaq needed a hero
instead it got me
all this power
and the only thing i can do with it
is hurt people
i will speak the word my son gave me
and i will give up my power
and when i do
you must ensure i never speak it again
shazam
some men are not meant
to be heroes
task force x black site
secret location
hey
so beautiful
surprised to see us
surprise is a dirty word in this business
are you sure you can handle him
youre the one who can see the future
youll tell me if we cant
just be careful with this one
you know they say the gods created us
but were the ones
who always wind up burying them
waller sends her regards
theyll know how to deal with him
to keep him from regaining his powers
theyll keep him in suspended animation
as long as hes submerged
he wont be able to speak
hell never say another word again
hey there he is
not all heroes wear capes
but i think you earned this
well statistically
most heroes dont wear capes
but yeah try it on
yeah looks pretty good
thats a nice touch
kent
kent
mission accomplished
my vision hasnt changed
but teth adams out of the equation
kent if this isnt over
i need to know whats coming
what is the helmet telling you
my vision has always shown me
great calamity
the world in flames
we can stop it
but you die
you shouldve told me sooner
i have no fear of death
thats precisely why i didnt tell you
the world needs the justice society
the world needs you
but you cant choose who lives and dies
thats fate right
well that sounds familiar
i remember seeing my first airplane
it was an raf deployment
headed to the western front
everyone on my street
came out to see them off
but i didnt cheer
even though i was only a boy
i knew where they were headed
and what awaited them
thanks to this ive lived longer
than i couldve ever have hoped for
i have seen the world change
in more ways than i couldve imagined
im still a sentimental fool
and i dont want my friend to die
ishmael said
death is the only path to life
but thats not what the inscription says
right life is the only way to death
maybe he got it backwards
like he read it in a mirror or something
thats it in kahndaqi mythology
the souls of the damned
are sent to the rock of finality
the underworld is a mirror to our own
here turn the crown around
now mirror the letters
see thats what i missed
death is the only path to life
he kidnapped amon on purpose
because he knew
that teth adam would kill him
and he believed the champions magic
would send him to the rock of finality
as life is the path to death
now your death is a path to life
the wizards have their champion
now we have ours
you will take the throne of kahndaq
and unleash hell on earth
speak our name
sabbac
what the bloody hell is that
readout says its the demon sabbac
get me closer now right now
were 100 miles out give me 20 seconds
the king has returned
the throne will be mine
brace yourselves
hold on
now prepare to die
wait wait wheres uncle karim
no matter what happens
he does not sit on that throne
copy that
were on it
heads up
activate infrared
sabbac show yourself
adrianna
amon
thats for my cruiser
this is it
we cant win carter
yeah but the world burns if we dont
right
bad plan is better than no plan at all
no no no what are you doing
giving us a third option
its supposed to be me
i didnt tell you my whole vision
old friend
i did see your death
but i also found a way to prevent it
it has been an extraordinary life
but always with one foot in the future
carter for the first time in 100 years
when i look ahead
i see nothing
no kent
and
its
beautiful
wait kent
goodbye
kent
my dear friend
kent
hit it from every side
kent
no
i am dr fate sorcerer
agent of the lords of order
defender against darkness and chaos
but even my powers cannot defeat you
theres no one that can defeat me
there is one there is one
teth adam
i know you can hear me
the battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us
now you are the only one
who can defeat the demon champion
you have the power
to be the destroyer of this world
but you can also be its savior
you believe you are not a worthy champion
because the wizards did not choose you
but fate does not make mistakes
neither did your son
we were wrong about you
the world doesnt always need
a white knight
sometimes it needs something darker
dont you dare give up on us now
the world needs you
kent
no
mom
whats happening
its sabbac
he commands the legions of hell
whatever happens
you stay behind me
dont worry i die by electricity
you want some kahndaq come and get it
come and get it
no no no
dont send me home i can help
i know
but you can do better
than swinging a stick
the gods have brought us together again
its not your time father
hey
what are you all standing around for
this is our chance
with these hands we built kahndaq
and with these hands we will set it free
the people need a hero
no father
they need to be free
what are we waiting for
say the word
shazam
the people of kahndaq rise up against you
yes
i got this
go get him
you know what i have to do
beat his ass
let the fate of kahndaq be decided
by a true battle of champions
lets end this
its a lot of them
its a bit more than i thought
yeah
just a bit
hey mom
these are our streets our city
free kahndaq
the wizards powers were wasted on you
you are not a hero
no im not
but he is
you cannot stand against me
i am kahndaqs true champion
i learned this trick from an old friend
you can control it
you have to
tell them the man in black sent you
yes
yes
i never tought id be happy to see you
im only here because of him
that makes two of us
see you around old friend
think you can keep him out of trouble
as long as no one comes looking for it
fair enough
just be careful
the kind of justice you dish out
can darken your soul
its his darkness that lets him do
what heroes like you cannot
i guess well find out wont we
i tought we made
a pretty good team back there
just saying
we made a great team
maybe we could
dont push it
smasher lets go
long live the champion
long live the champion
long live the champion
you could lead them
how does it feel
wrong
so what now
does this mean youre finally
gonna be our hero
kahndaq has always had heroes
and it still does
what is needs now is a protector
thank you teth adam
perhaps that name is a little
oldfashioned
so what should we call you
black adam
okay black adam
my name is amanda waller
congratulations you have my attention
this is gonna be your only warning
you dont want to stay in my prison
thats fine
kahndaq is your prison now
you step one foot ouside of it
you will not live to regret it
theres no one on this planet
that can stop me
i can call in a favor and send people
who arent from this planet
send them all
