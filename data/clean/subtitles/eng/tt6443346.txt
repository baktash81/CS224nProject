the first self governing people on earth 
kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment 
for centuries  they thrived 
but then   
came king ahk ton 
using the army to seize power 
ahk ton became a tyrant 
but he had even darker ambitions 
obsessed with dark magic 
ahk ton s real goal
was to forge the crown of sabbac 
if infused with the powers
of the six demons of the ancient world 
it would make ahk ton invincible 
to make the crown  he needed eternium 
a rare mineral of magic properties 
found only in kahndaq 
so he enslaved his own people   
and forced them to dig 
eternium 
eternium 
eternium 
kahndaq was teetering on the brink 
what they needed   
get off him 
get off him 
   was a hero 
why are we fighting each other 
remember who our real enemy is 
come with me 
look  eternium 
let me see that 
the king thanks you 
he s supposed to reward him 
is that right 
i want what i m owed 
you want a reward 
the king thanks you for your service 
you want the king s reward too 
no  but my son accepts the king s mercy 
i won t always be here to protect you 
i don t need protection 
i want to be free 
if we fight together 
we could overthrow the king 
let someone else be the hero   
the graveyards are full of them 
stop dreaming and go back to work 
someone to hold the hopes of the people 
even when all hope seems lost 
if we had more heroes   
then maybe our freedom wouldn t be a dream 
freedom 
king ahk ton knew that this spark
could quickley ignite a fire 
and so he ordered that it be snuffed out 
they thought they were getting a martyr 
instead   
they got a miracle 
the council of wizards 
the magical guardians of the earth   
you have been chosen 
   sought to restore the balance 
they empowered him with the gifts
of the ancient gods 
and turned a boy   
into a champion 
s h a z a m 
hurry 
give it to me 
but the crown had already been completed 
give it to me 
and when the champion arrived
at the palace to challange him   
king ahk ton summoned
its demonic power 
in the ensuing battle 
the palace was destroyed 
but the champion was victorious 
the wizards hid the crown of sabbac   
 so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man 
and the champion
was never heard from again 
khandaq  present day
today  kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries 
the intergang  the latest
in a series of foreign invaders 
but legend says 
whenever kahndaq needs him most 
the champion will return
to restore freedom to the people 
it has been a long  long wait 
show me your papers 
intergang checkpoint
sector 5   north shiruta
have your documentation ready 
it s all our three documents  yeah 
don t judge the picture 
it s after my girlfriend broke up with me 
open the back  need a look inside 
yeah  it s unlocked  man 
it s just a bunch of old tvs 
i m an electrician 
watch where you re going 
you know the drill  back of the line 
come on  man  you see me every day 
and every day i tell ya 
if it s got wheels  it s a vehicle 
back of the line  mate 
you re not my mate 
i m heartbroken  now  go on  piss off 
no  what you are
is a neo imperialist enforcer 
from halfway around the world 
sent here to steal
my country s natural resources 
strip mine our sacred lands 
pollute our water 
oppress our heritage 
and make us wait in lines all day 
hey  boss man  can i go 
go on  get out of here 
yeah  yeah 
detain
adrianna  we re clear 
kahndaq isn t safe for us anymore 
let s just move the crown first 
and then we can worry about safe 
i got intergang watching my house 
i gave up my job at the university
and moved four times 
it doesn t mean
i m gonna abandon my country 
i m just saying 
no one stays a step ahead of them forever 
we can t wait for things
to cool down this time 
if i m right 
they re days away from finding it 
what are you doing 
  i want to come with you 
you know it s too dangerous 
you shouldn t have gotten involved 
come on 
i want to help you beat those bastards 
adriana  keep your head down  please 
you want to be a hero  huh 
  i do  yeah 
go home  do your homework 
your time will come one day 
but not today  son 
go 
go  little man  you did good 
that would get you a fortune
on the black market 
is that real eternium 
show us a little magic 
it doesn t work like that  it s unrefined 
you guys should get some rest 
i thought intergang
seized all the old relics 
hey  come on  stop it 
i m just curious how she got it 
my grandmother gave it to me 
how did she get it 
  it s not a museum piece 
it s a family heirloom 
going all the way back to the days
when kahndaq was free 
you happy now 
cool story 
and all i inherited was a sweater 
that s not true 
baba left you his van  and his bald spot 
you know  some women like a bald spot 
curly on the outside 
smooth on the inside  you know 
are you sure about this 
the inscrptions we found are clear 
and i m positive about that translation 
there is something inside that mountain 
what if it really is the crown  then what 
it s a source of great power 
who gets to keep it 
no one  we hide it again someplace else 
get it out of the country if we have to 
it is too dangerous for anyone to have 
this is it 
not yet 
are you coming 
  bad knee  i ll keep watch 
this way  almost there 
 men were given the gift of magic 
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted  
keep reading 
 the ultimate power was banished
from the earth and hidden    here  
until now 
this mountain has kept
the crown of sabbac safe for 5 000 years 
we re 100 percent  totally  no take backs
certain that we want to move it 
we don t have a choice 
what happened to ishmael 
great  don t worry  i ll find him 
samir 
samir  what happened 
what 
i can t hear you  what are you saying 
don t move 
unless you want to join your mate 
stay where you are 
oh  hey  oh  hey  hey   
 turn back  
that s what it says  no 
yes 
where is samir 
claustrophobic  needed some air 
is this the way to the crown 
  i think so 
it s a tomb 
 speak not his power 
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep
for all eternity  teth adam 
the slave who became champion
and defeated the king 
the legend was true 
kahndaq    really did have a hero once 
if he was such a hero 
why d they bury him down here 
the crown 
it s over 
now  give me the crown 
run  addy  run 
hold fire 
don t hit the crown  get her 
go  move 
  circle around 
get down 
say goodbye to your brother 
in five

we re en route to your location 
we need immediate backup 
send everything you ve got 
this rare  magical mineral
has been mined for centuries   
   reports of an eternium blast 
it is unknown who or why   
   has decimated a number of troops 
we are waiting on   
   an unidentified male 
this being is somehow able to harness   
what do you think 
i think this loose cannon
needs to be locked down   
before innocent people start getting hurt 
oh  and good mornig to you  too 
shove it up your ass  carter 
he s been asleep for 5 000 years 
he ll be disoriented at first

al rothstein

uncle al

you listen to carter 
i m gonna make you proud  uncle al 
i promise 
they seem green 
that s why i called in kent 
кent s been out of action
for a little while 
but i can t do this without him 
takes magic to fight magic

it might take a lot than that 
are you sure they can take him 
waller  you find us a cell
that can hold him   
we ll take care of the rest 
good luck 
this is gonna be fun 
we re here  sir 
oh  right 
was i staring again 
only half an hour or so  sir 
maybe next time  honk the horn 
of course  sir 
hawkman s estate
saint roch  louisiana
so what s the op 
we re headed to kahndaq to
apprehend and contain   
a class a rogue metahuman 
i didn t bring passport 
we don t need passports 
we re the justice society 
is this entirely made out of nth metal 
everyting down to the screws 
completely indestructible 
i ll be in the cockpit if you need me 
it s pretty cool  you got any snacks 
it takes a lot of energy to smash atoms 
here 
oh  thanks 
i m al  by the way 
мaxine 
what do you do 
wind  you 
i grow 
сool 
whoa 
don t worry about that 
i can get another one 
my mom s not much of a doctor 
but you should probably leave th   
or do that 
i know you have a lot to catch up on 
but  i was thinking
we could help each other 
мove 
  i m amon  by the way 
i didn t ask for your name 
you re teth adam  right 
everyone in kahndaq knows your story 
i said move 
my mom said you took out a bunch
of intergang soldiers in the desert 
because they wouldn t move out of my way 
so you can really fly and stop bullets 
 cause that s really crucial to my plan 
and is it really you stopping the bullets
or is it the suit 
wait  what s your top speed 
i m sure you re fast  but how fast 
like flash fast 
wait  did you not have
mirrors back then 
wow  i guess a lot does change
in 5 000 years 
five thousand years 
yeah  that s how long
you were in the tomb 
until my mom woke you up 
so you ve got stopping bullets  check 
flying  check 
and lighting thing  that s a big check 
i don t know this place 
this is your home 
then my home is gone 
what happened to the crown 
too much 
you know it s cursed with demons  right 
 life is the    only path to death  
no shit 
 teth adam was a bronze age
kahndaqi demi god  
 he defeated king ahk ton
in approximately 2 600 bc  
there  that s you  see 
that s the statue they built of you 
and now you re back 
our country s been oppressed
by one invader   
after another over since you left 
my point is  kahndaq still isn t free 
we could really use a superhero
right about now 
i m no hero 
what 
superman  batman  aquaman   
you re way more stacked than any of them 
and they re not coming
to kahndaq to save us 
but you could stop intergang
all by yourself 
just like you did king ahk ton 
you re our only hope 
wizards 
i can fix it  don t worry 
i m not a wizard 
hey  mom  he s awake 
i told you not to go in your room 
it was you who spoke 
you woke me 
i didn t have a choice 
i d be dead if it hadn t worked 
the men in my tomb 
they were your enemies 
then your enemies are vanquished 
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned 
actually  we still have a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing 
then destroy them 
intergang have guns and flybikes
and eternium rockets 
we have my mom 
prove your strength 
destroy your enemy and all he cares about 
make him beg for mercy 
but deny it until his final breath 
interesting  okay 
i appreciate what you did to for me 
but i do not
want you teaching my son violence 
i understand 
you want his father to teach him violence 
gross  that s my brother 
  that s my sister 
his father s dead 
  i m sorry 
who do you want
to teach him violence then 
yeah  mom 
who do you want to teach me violence 
no one 
i want a champion
to help free kahndaq from intergang 
please  help us 
wait  wait 
where are you going 
  i shouldn t be here 
you don t feel any loyalty to us at all 
not really  no 
you re not seeing
the full possibilities here 
i don t know what is was like
in ancient times 
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal in our world 
maybe clean up your outfit a little bit 
get a cape  change your name 
teth adam is a very strong name 
it s a little outdated 
and you definitely need a catchphrase 
something blackout bad ass to say 
right before you absolutely
cook some dude 
i don t waste words on the dead 
well  yeah  kind of like that 
but more catchy 
i was thinking  like 
 tell them the man in the black sent you  
them 
  you know  gods  demons   
whoever s waiting for us in the afterlife 
and you wear a lot of black 
so we should really lean into that 
my point is  you could be famous 
magazines  lunch boxes  video games 
and the superhero industrial complex
is worth a lot of money 
i don t need a box for my lunch 
anyone you ve ever known is dead 
what else are you gonna do 
wait  where are you going 
waller s file needs a bit to be desired 
most of this was considered a myth
until yesterday afternoon 
he s a bad man  kent 
what else do you need to know 
when you ve seen
as many different futures as i have 
you cease to believe in absolutes 
what are you laughing at 
i m not laughing  that was a smirk 
i know  that s how you laugh 
i ve missed having you around
to spout old cryptic shit like that 
almost as much as i ve missed
having you around to ignore all my advice 
carter   
this is not a very good plan 
yeah  well   
a bad plan is better than no plan at all 
if only there were a third option 
i wouldn t touch that if i was you 
why not 
 cause that helmet is from another planet 
it s millions of years old 
it chooses who it lets touch it 
like kent 
  yeah 
like  kent is leterally possessed
when he puts it on 
what happens if i touch it anyway 
soul crushing terror  or    something 
so we should probably
put a towel on it  right 
coming up on it 
ready stations in five 
hey  why is this adam dude so pissed off 
he s not some dude 
he s a weapon of mass destruction 
you don t have to raise your hand 
question  if he s so powerful 
how are we supposed to stop him 
if we can get him to say the word 
 shazam  
teth adam will lose his power 
and we re hoping since he s had
a few thousand years to sleep it off 
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence 
from the footage you showed us 
he doesn t really seem
like a  peacefully negotiate  kind of guy 
correct 
look alive 
we re here 
entering kahndaqi airspace
forgive me 
this is a message
for all intergang soldiers 
kahndaq has its own
official superhero now 
тeth adam 
please 
there he is  move 
тeth adam 
  move 
тeth adam   
who s gonna save you now  mate 
the statue 
that s my son 
he s just a boy 
he doesn t know what he s doing 
what are you doing 
hang on  i recognize you 
where is the crown 
let s go 
you could ve showed up a bit sooner 
but that was dope 
we need backup down here 
tell them the man in black sent you 
well  yes  but not to me 
say it to the bad guys 
but before you zap them 
catchphrase  then kill 
  yes 
he s here 
you sense his presence 
no 
i assume he s the only person
in kahndaq that can do that 
fate and i ll take the lead  listen 
now  you two hang back  til we call you 
we re the anvil  you re the hammer 
you re ready 
he just dropped the   
shit 
be prepared 
behind you 
let us be 
i don t know their crimes 
but whatever they are 
these men should face due process 
then let the gods make their judgment 
yeah 
  yeah 
you don t look like an intergang 
we re the justice society 
our mission is to protect
global stability 
we re here to restore peace to kahndaq 
and we will use force if necessary 
force is always necessary 
teth adam 
we know who you are
and what you are capable of 
there s no place for you
in the world of man 
you have two choices  kneel or die 
i was a slave until i died 
then i was reborn a god 
i kneel before no one 
fate  give me a distraction 
just say   shazam   we all go home 
i don t have a home 
look at that suit  it s cool 
thanks  you  too 
thank you  it was a hand me down 
it was from my uncle 
hawkman just does not give up  does he 
  nope 
amon  where are you going  wait 
to help him 
cyclone  smasher  now is your time 
let s roll 
what are you doing  hey 
no 
i ll be right there 
you have the crown of sabbac 
i can t hold him much longer 
move 
i m coming 
i m zeroing in on your location 
i got him  guys  i got him 
it s me  al 
in case you didn t recognize me 
there s something different about you 
can t quite put my finger on it 
you know  it s probably because
i m six stories tall now 
but you    you re like a tornado 
i thought the two of you did great work 
first time out    bravo 
thanks  i mean 
i got a little turned around back there 
but  it all worked out  right 
you re damn right it did 
let s hope waller
has that cell ready for him 
you want me to keep my hand here  right 
you d better not let him up 
what do i do  guys 
long live the champion 
long live the champion 
long live the champion 
long live the champion 
yeah  he s definitely still breathing 
long live the champion 
long live the champion 
where are you going 
we need to go after him 
we re not strong enough 
oh  well  maybe next time
use your powers of prediction   
to figure that out
before we gor our asses kicked 
i m working on it 
miss 
excuse me  you mind if i look in your bag 
yes  i do mind 
where are you going with this  kent 
she s got the crown of sabbac 
one catastrophe at a time 
we can t give him a chance to regroup 
he s been spotted entering the palace 
it safe to say
he s not going there to surrender 
why do you want teth adam to surrender 
he s the champion of kahndaq  who are you 
the justice society 
we have been living under
military occupation for 27 years 
and never seen you before 
you didn t come when intergang
invaded our country 
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband 
but now  we finally have our own hero   
and you decide to fly down here
and save us 
thank you  but    we re covered 
go and protect inernational stability
someplace else 
oh  and second  i don t have the crown 
let me spell it out for you 
teth adam can t be kahndaq s champion
because he is not a hero 
tell that   
to all the people he just liberated 
i know what this looks like  i do 
but i can assure you that my t   
i am so sorry  was that expensive 
me and you 
when we get back to the ship   
yes  sir 
  me and you 
i   
can we please just see the crown 
i don t have it 
we don t have time for this 
teth adam first  then the crown 
you don t have any authority here 
teth adam has done nothing   
teth adam is not who you think he is 
and how whould you know 
we have access to ancient texts
that have been kept secret for centuries 
and what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say 
they say that his rage
nearly destroyed kahndaq 
and we flew all the way over here
to stop it from happening again 
you want to go in there alone 
are you sure 
you want to go in and fight
teth adam again  be my guest 
but if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully 
without destroying the rest of my city 
i m your only shot 
you brought the invaders with you 
they only want to talk 
they can talk  i won t listen 
when i was a little girl 
my grandmother told me the story   
of how the champion came
to this exact spot   
to free the enslaved people of kahndaq
by defeating king ahk ton in battle 
but according to the justice society 
that s not really what happened 
they say that you didn t come here
to seek justice 
hurry 
give it to me 
that you came to exact revenge 
and in your anger   
don t kill me 
i can give you anything you want 
this is what i want 
   your power grew
until it became uncontrollable 
and the council of wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy   
of the gifts that you were granted 
we have chosen recklessly   
and humanity has paid the price 
and now  teth adam   
you must pay 
it wasn t your tomb that i opened  was it 
it was your prison 
and now there s a statue of you 
out of the hope that someday
kahndaq s champion would return 
but it s built on a lie  isn t it 
i never said i was a hero 
i never claimed to be anything 
you may not have been a hero 
but that doesn t mean
that you can t be one now 
i will hear them out 
but if they choose to fight 
they choose to die 
uncle karim 
i can t believe you re sitting around
watching tv   
when the most epic day ever is   
in here  little man 
ishmael  my mom said
you got buried in the tomb 
funny story  he didn t 
where s adrianna 
she s back at the square   
  we should go bail her out right now 
but she s the one who sent me home
to make sure the crown s safe 
it is safe  okay  somewhere else 
definitely not here  let    okay   
put the bag down 
  what are you doing 
back away  put the bag down  now 
give him the bag  give hime the bag 
very good  back away 
back away 
  oké  i m   
it s all going to be okay  little man 
let me teach you some history
that you ve never learned   
in one of your mother s classes 
when we had a powerful king 
kahndaq used to be something
much better than free 
it used to be great 
run  amon  run 
crash the building 
i lost the kid  he has the crown 
we re here to negotoiate the terms
of your peaceful surrender 
i m not peaceful  nor do i surrender 
what have your powers ever given to you 
nothing but heartache 
you have no idea 
then why are you making this hard on us 
we both know
you re not supposed to be here 
it is you who is not supposed to be here 
i want you all to leave
kahndaq and never return 
gladly  with you as our prisoner 
how  bout i rip
you little wings off instead 
i d like to see you try 
  okay  more fighting won t solve this 
i disagree 
  me  too 
looks like we found common ground 
this can only end one way 
мom 
  amon 
i got home and ishmael was in the kitchen 
ishmael s dead 
no  he shot uncle karim 
and he s after the crown 
ground forces   
i m hiding in our building 
and intergang s here 
they re coming 
intergang are after my son 
they don t want him 
they want the crown of sabbac 
i know you re not a hero 
but you re not a monster  either 
i don t care what anyone says 
you saved me in that cave 
you didn t know me
and your first instinct was to save me 
i m begging you  please  save my son 
check the whole place clean 
cover all access points 
keep looking 
area s clear 
there  take him 
right there  right there 
shit   
move  move 
don t shoot him  i need him 
end of the road  kid 
release the child 
whatever you say 
yes 
thank you 
but maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time 
оh  and remember your catchphrase 
time to go  amon 
where s the crown 
  what crown 
you want to be brave  eh 
  i want you to go to hell 
that s the plan  little man 
we er gonna go for a ride  come one 
put me down  put me down 
you should really be more careful
with your word choice next time 
and tell them that the man in black   
he s right behind me 
where the hell is everybody 
mom 
amon  where are you 
no  no  no  what 
i m on one of their bikes 
what bikes 
amon

mom  i m okay 
shit 
activate infrared 
what are you doing 
searching for the child 
no  you re murdering people 
how else do i find the child 
i can help you 
but no more extrajudicial killings 
i don t need any help 
smasher  cyclone 
what are you waiting for 
come on  let s go 
  okay 
okay  i got this  on the count of three 
one  two   
this feels a lot higher than last time 
that was not cool 
whoa  slow down 
i got you  i got you 
engine failure
hey  careful  dude  i almost hit you 
i am so sorry 
i don t really have peripheral vision
in the mask  it s my uncle s 
i ll get it tailored 
me and you 
roger that 
who are you 
  call me dr  fate 
how bad is it  doc  am i dying 
i m not that kind of doctor 
but don t worry  i can see the future 
this isn t how you re going to die 
how do i die  then 
just stay away from electricity 
wait  what  i m an electrician 
how the hell am i supposed to do that 
over speed
eternium levels critical
oh  god 
the champion s coming for you 
you know that  right 
i m counting on it 
please don t 
teth adam  where are you 
you followed me 
my mind and body can exist
in different places at the same time 
did you find the boy 
caught one of the bikes 
but he didn t have the child 
bring me the prisoner 
i ll break his mind 
you killed him  didn t you 
he didn t make it 
the bullet s extracted 
the tissue damage has been repaired 
blood pressure  120 over 81 
heart rate s at 74 bpm 
he ll be back on his feet in no time 
that is insane 
the nanobots did most of the work 
no  no  no 
i m not gonna let you downplay this 
i literally just witnessed a miracle 
what  i say something stupid 
no  it s just that you can transform
your molecular structure 
grow a hundred times your own size 
you re an impossibility
and the world still amazes you 
i don t know  it s    it s cool 
thank you 
but it s not as cool as nanobots 
that s how you do your wind thing 
well  the wind thing
is called aerokinesis 
and the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream   
by this really messed up scientist
who kidnapped me when i was 15 
i m    so sorry 
no  you re good 
it seems like you really turned it around 
found your calling 
hoping this is mine 
there s no point in dwelling in the past 
it s already moved on from you 
why did you say that 
you were blaming yourself
for trusting ishmael 
your thoughts are beter spent
on the things you can change 
not those you can t 
you see the future 
tell me how i get my son back 
by trusting us 
karim will live  we will save amon 
it s what we do 
i suppose they didn t have doors
in your day 
well  of course we did 
that s how we entered rooms 
what i did there is called sarcasm 
where s amon  did you found him 
not yet  but i will 
the men who took him will suffer 
maybe these guys can help 
there s an upside to keeping prisoners 
they can answer our questions 
what did you do with my son 
adrianna  adrianna 
i ve learned that in this modern world 
we shouldn t hurt our prisoners 
we should treat them
with dignity  respect 
no 
let s start with just one simple question 
can either of you fly 
shit 
i think i ll sit this one out 
tell me what you did with amon 
you d better not drop those prisoners 
i m not going to drop them 
i m going to drop one of them 
whoever ansers first lives  where is he 
i don t know 
he s at our mine in the desert 
i can show   
oh  you gotta be kidding me 
you said you wouldn t hurt the prisoners 
that was sarcasm 
no  technically  it was just a lie 
intergang have a mine in the desert 
amon is there 
  i know it 
it s near the al hadidiyah mountains 
let s go 
i told you  stop killing people 
they look alive to me 
because i saved them 
well  that s why i waited
until you were there 
i got the information i needed 
no one died 
i did it your way 
he does have a point 
i know it got lost in all the confusing 
but we still have some issues
to settle here 
we know where amon is  we have to go 
there s no  we  here 
there are only heroes
and there are villains 
you think yourself a hero 
but you would let these criminals go free 
knowing that many more will suffer
at their hands unless we end them now 
heroes don t kill people 
well  i do 
here we go 
is that what i think it is 
23 pounds of pure ethernium 
much denser than typical artifacts
of the period 
king must have had a really strong neck 
no  it snapped when i killed him 
what s that 
there s writing on the inside of the rim 
 life is the only path to death  
that s what it says 
life is the only path to death 
well  that s surprisingly obvious 
could it have another meaning 
what if it means  like   
 life is short 
you gotta hold on to what you love  
stop 
deep 
it doesn t matter what it means 
it should be buried under the ocean
for eternity 
that s not far from what we had in mind
for you when this is over 
or i could bury you with it 
we can t get rid of it now 
it s the one thing that intergang wants 
believe me  i know more than anyone
what this crown is capable of 
but we have to keep it
until my son is safe 
adrianna   
trust me  we will get your son back 
they don t care about him 
they just want to defeat me 
hand it over 
we can t risk letting this crown fall
into the wrong hands 
we will find another way 
no 
you like to split the world
into good and bad 
but that s easy to do
when you re the one drawing the line 
all i care about is amon 
and until he is safe 
we re all on the same side 
and you    you will work together 
set a course
for the al hadidiyah mountains 
we ll go in at dawn 
i hope you can be a team player 
i love teams 
that was sarcasm again  yes 
very much so 
good  just checking 
a wise man once told me
a bad plan is better than no plan at all 
that was before we had a very bad plan 
let it go 
i d rather be fighting with him
than against him 
he s a murderer  kent 
if he turns on us 
that kid is as good as dead 
you don t get to decide who lives or dies 
that s    up to fate 
what s the helmet telling you 
somebody s gonna die 
who is it  atom smasher 
it s atom smasher 
surprisingly  no 
is it me 
when it s time for you and i
to say goodbye  you ll know 
all i can tell you is   
there is still time to change the future 
let s use it 
well  i guess we re sticking
with a very bad plan 
al hadidiyah mine
intergang controlled operation
the al hadidiyah mine
is intergang s most valued asset 
i m gonna land us right here 
cut off their access to reinforcements 
but the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress 
there is only one way in  one way out 
we ll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol 
communication is key 
we keep in step or we get outflanked 
we move through the mine  inch by inch 
until we find amon 
this is where you come in 
are you ready    damn it 
or we could just do that 
pure eternium shield 
unbreakable  even with your powers 
amon 
you hurt him  i will kill all of you 
nobody has to die  we just want the crown 
we don t have it 
believe me 
nothing good will come from that crown 
no crown  no negotiation 
i have it 
it s right here 
release my son  you can have it 
what do you think you re doing 
intergang killed my husband 
i m not letting them take my son  too 
not your son  not your country 
not your decision to make 
stop there 
it s okay  nothing is gonna happen to you 
hand it over  now 
i m sorry  mama 
  no 
now  let amon go 
i thank you 
and i thanks your friends for returning
this crown to its rightful owner 
what kind of champion of kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders 
you have what you want 
let him go 
ishmael  what are you doing 
taking back what s mine 
i m the last living descendant
of king ahk ton the great 
and you have just given me
everything i need to become the next   
king of kahndaq 
my family passed the knowledge on 
you know  one to the next 
this crown  crafted by our ancestors 
stolen by the wizards and hidden away 
but still a source of great power 
if only we can wield it 
they say when hurut died 
you wept like a baby 
i wonder if you ll do the same for them 
please  ishmael 
sorry  amon 
fate  get ready 
death is the only path to life 
amon 
amon 
he s alive 
but we need to get him to the medical bay 
where is he shot 
  it wasn t a bullet 
it was me 
come 
we re going with you 
just find the crown 
get it on the cruiser 
i found the crown  but it s not alone 
how long we gonna keep doing this 
there s no point in fighting 
we both know no one can stop me 
you re right 
only you can 
ishmael said you cried when hurut died 
who s hurut 
hurut was a true champion of kahndaq 
and he was also    my son 
i won t always be here to protect you 
i don t need protection 
i want to be free 
freedom is for the birds 
let someone else be the hero   
the graveyards are full of them 
i tried to protect him 
but i wasn t strong enough 
shazam 
the wizards decided
that he would be their champion 
but after the champion s many victories 
the king went after
what hurut loved the most 
our family 
hold on  father 
stay with me 
with my powers   
you ll be safe 
i couldn t protect your mother 
repeat what i say 
shazam 
  shazam 
instead of battling the king   
instead of saving kahndaq   
hurut chose to save   
me 
but he couldn t save himself
from the king s assassins 
the powers were not a gift
from the wizards   
but a curse 
born out of rage 
the statue of the champion isn t you 
it s hurut 
my son dreamt of a better world 
that s why he saved me 
but the world was only a better place
with him in it 
kahndaq needed a hero 
instead  it got me 
all this power   
and the only thing i can do with it
is hurt people 
i will speak the word my son gave me 
and i will give up my power 
and when i do 
you must ensure i never speak it again 
shazam 
some men are not meant   
to be heroes 
task force x black site
secret location
hey 
so beautiful 
surprised to see us 
surprise is a dirty word in this business 
are you sure you can handle him 
you re the one who can see the future 
you ll tell me if we can t 
just be careful with this one 
you know  they say the gods created us 
but we re the ones
who always wind up burying them 
waller sends her regards 
they ll know how to deal with him 
to keep him from regaining his powers 
they ll keep him in suspended animation 
as long as he s submerged 
he won t be able to speak 
he ll never say another word again 
hey  there he is 
not all heroes wear capes 
but i think you earned this 
well  statistically 
most heroes don t wear capes 
but yeah  try it on 
yeah  looks pretty good 
that s a nice touch 
kent 
kent 
mission accomplished 
my vision hasn t changed 
but teth adam s out of the equation 
kent  if this isn t over 
i need to know what s coming 
what is the helmet telling you 
my vision has always shown me
great calamity 
the world in flames 
we can stop it   
but you die 
you should ve told me sooner 
i have no fear of death 
that s precisely why i didn t tell you 
the world needs the justice society 
the world needs you 
but you can t choose who lives and dies 
that s fate  right 
well  that sounds familiar 
i remember seeing my first airplane 
it was an raf deployment 
headed to the western front 
everyone on my street
came out to see them off 
but i didn t cheer 
even though i was only a boy 
i knew where they were headed 
and what awaited them 
thanks to this  i ve lived longer
than i could ve ever have hoped for 
i have seen the world change
in more ways than i could ve imagined 
i m still a sentimental fool 
and i don t want my friend to die 
ishmael said 
 death is the only path to life  
but that s not what the inscription says 
right   life is the only way to death  
maybe he got it backwards 
like he read it in a mirror or something 
that s it  in kahndaqi mythology 
the souls of the damned
are sent to the rock of finality 
the underworld is a mirror to our own 
here  turn the crown around 
now mirror the letters 
see  that s what i missed 
 death is the only path to life  
he kidnapped amon on purpose 
because he knew
that teth adam would kill him 
and he believed the champion s magic
would send him to the rock of finality 
as life is the path to death 
now your death is a path to life 
the wizards have their champion 
now we have ours 
you will take the throne of kahndaq   
and unleash hell on earth 
speak our name 
 sabbac  
what the bloody hell is that 
readout says it s the demon  sabbac 
get me closer  now  right now 
we re 100 miles out  give me 20 seconds 
the king has returned 
the throne will be mine 
brace yourselves 
hold on 
now prepare to die 
wait  wait  where s uncle karim 
no matter what happens 
he does not sit on that throne 
copy that 
  we re on it 
heads up 
activate infrared 
sabbac  show yourself 
adrianna 
amon 
that s for my cruiser 
this is it 
we can t win  carter 
yeah  but the world burns if we don t 
right 
bad plan is better than no plan at all 
no  no  no  what are you doing 
giving us a third option 
it s supposed to be me 
i didn t tell you my whole vision 
old friend 
i did see your death 
but i also found a way to prevent it 
it has been an extraordinary life 
but always with one foot in the future 
carter  for the first time in 100 years 
when i look ahead   
i see nothing 
no  kent 
and   
it s   
beautiful 
wait  kent 
goodbye   
kent 
   my dear friend 
kent 
hit it from every side 
kent 
no 
i am dr  fate  sorcerer 
agent of the lords of order 
defender against darkness and chaos 
but even my powers cannot defeat you 
there s no one that can defeat me 
there is one    there is one   
teth adam 
i know you can hear me 
the battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us 
now you are the only one
who can defeat the demon champion 
you have the power
to be the destroyer of this world 
but you can also be its savior 
you believe you are not a worthy champion
because the wizards did not choose you 
but fate does not make mistakes 
neither did your son 
we were wrong about you 
the world doesn t always need
a white knight 
sometimes it needs something darker 
don t you dare give up on us now 
the world needs you 
kent 
no 
mom 
what s happening 
it s sabbac 
he commands the legions of hell 
whatever happens   
you stay behind me 
don t worry  i die by electricity 
you want some kahndaq  come and get it 
come and get it 
no  no  no 
don t send me home  i can help 
  i know 
but you can do better
than swinging a stick 
the gods have brought us together again 
it s not your time  father 
hey 
what are you all standing around for 
this is our chance 
with these hands  we built kahndaq 
and with these hands  we will set it free 
the people need a hero 
no  father 
they need to be free 
what are we waiting for 
say the word 
shazam 
the people of kahndaq rise up against you 
yes 
i got this 
go get him 
you know what i have to do 
beat his ass 
let the fate of kahndaq be decided
by a true battle of champions 
let s end this 
it s a lot of them 
it s a bit more than i thought 
  yeah 
just a bit 
hey  mom 
these are our streets  our city 
free kahndaq 
the wizards  powers were wasted on you 
you are not a hero 
no  i m not 
but he is 
you cannot stand against me 
i am kahndaq s true champion 
i learned this trick from an old friend 
you can control it 
you have to 
tell them the man in black sent you 
yes 
  yes 
i never tought i d be happy to see you 
i m only here because of him 
that makes two of us 
see you around  old friend 
think you can keep him out of trouble 
as long as no one comes looking for it 
fair enough 
just be careful 
the kind of justice you dish out
can darken your soul 
it s his darkness that lets him do
what heroes like you cannot 
i guess we ll find out  won t we 
i tought we made
a pretty good team back there 
just saying 
we made a great team 
maybe we could   
  don t push it 
smasher  let s go 
long live the champion 
long live the champion 
long live the champion 
you could lead them 
how does it feel 
wrong 
so    what now 
does this mean you re finally
gonna be our hero 
kahndaq has always had heroes 
and it still does 
what is needs now is a protector 
thank you  teth adam 
perhaps that name is a little   
old fashioned 
so what should we call you 
black adam
okay   black adam  
my name is amanda waller 
congratulations  you have my attention 
this is gonna be your only warning 
you don t want to stay in my prison 
that s fine 
kahndaq is your prison now 
you step one foot ouside of it 
you will not live to regret it 
there s no one on this planet
that can stop me 
i can call in a favor and send people
who aren t from this planet 
send them all
