  your bank 
  right  my bank 
  you are very attractive for a banker 
  thank you  i m not a banker  i m a lawyer 
really  what kind of law
are you involved in  pretty eyes 
sexual harassment  mostly 
but i also handle real estate and tax law 
which is why i m here 
  this place is in default 
  no  you re in foreclosure 
you were in default
when we sent you delinquency notices 
  i thought those were just warnings 
  they were warnings 
no one warned me  what happens now 
i make my payments out to somebody else 
you have 30 days to pay the balance
of your mortgage  or you lose your gym 
perfect  what s the damage 
what do i owe you 
 50 000 
personal cheque gonna be ok  might have
to wait till the end of the month to cash her 
i do have to switch some funds  the charity
i like to work with is gonna take a hit 
mr la fleur  i can assure you
this is a very serious situation 
yeah 
this is extremely serious  mrs veatch 
it s ms  i ll need to review all of your financial
statements and assess any tax liabilities 
absolutely 
i don t know how you say  ms  for  mr  
but if there was a  ms mr  
i m a ms as well 
you do keep financial records 
invoices  revenue reports  taxable income 
you kidding  i got a closet full of  em 
i call  em keepers 
  problem is i ve never really filed them 
  no kidding 
just out of curiosity 
who would want to buy this place anyway 
come on  squeeze it  squeeze it 
yeah  come on  come on  get it up 
one more  bitch  one more  bitch 
yeah  yeah 
  now you re my bitch 
  yeah 
yeah  baby 
involuntary spasm 
look at the show  enjoy the show 
this a bad time  i could come back 
looks like some real dude sweat going on 
add three pounds to the scales in the
women s locker room before you go home 
refreshment 
i ve got protein paste  carb laxative   
  suffocated kumquat  perhaps 
  i m trying to cut down on those 
  they re good  they are good 
  know what you mean 
walk with me 
hey  brianna 
cellulite seminar tomorrow  0600 
nice job  susie 
you call that a sit up 
don t slack  trevor 
i m watching you 
there s a good energy in the gym 
let me guess why you re here  pete 
because i bought out
the second mortgage on your gym 
you ve got 30 days to make  50 000 
or your gym becomes my gym 
i know we ve had our differences   
is that what you call
sleeping with three of my female trainers 
it was one night 
or the strip o gram you sent me
for the globo gym one year anniversary 
  it was meant to be congratulatory 
  it was also a man 
let s not get hung up on details 
  we re both professionals 
  really 
last i heard  my gym makes money 
yours doesn t 
my gym s worth over  4 million 
your gym isn t worth four 
i have shareholders 
you haven t even got cupholders 
  why would i want cupholders 
  the point is
globo gym is a beacon
of human physical perfection 
a benchmark in the fitness community 
your  gym  is a skid mark
on the underpants of society 
see  peter  i wasn t born
expecting the world to do me any favours 
i earned this body
and i built this temple
out of nothing more than
a little can do attitude and elbow grease 
and a large inheritance
from my father  earl goodman 
so if i choose to level average joe s to build
a parking structure for my members  so be it 
there s nothing you can do about it 
in 30 days  i ll be bulldozing that shit heap
you call a gym into permanent nothingness 
i can only hope that you  and the mongrel
race that comprise your membership 
are inside it when i do 
show mr la fleur out 
turn it up high  reggie 
i wanna burn 
so that s the deal  we got 30 days
to raise  50 000  or average joe s is history 
i got ten minutes  i ll open it up to some q a 
no need to raise your hands 
it s an open forum  ok  owen  kick us off 
yes  peter    and i m just spitballing here  
but why don t we pay it off
in canadian dollars and save some money 
just so you know  if that s a route
you want to follow  it s 50 000 american 
it would be 70 000  roughly  canadian dollars 
  how are we gonna come up with  120 000 
  owen  you don t add them together 
technically  peter  i m sorry to say this 
but it s more like  73 313   
it doesn t matter  we can t come up
with  50 000  we re screwed 
gar 
  it s an insurmountable amount of money 
  no  it s not insurmountable  come on 
we can tjust sit back
and let globo gym take us over 
average joe s is too important 
where do you go
when your wife changes the locks 
  average joe s 
  right 
dwight  owen  what will you do
if joe s goes under  work at the airport 
  i ain t working at no airport again 
  no  cos you hated it 
and  steve  where do you go
to do whatever it is that you do 
  gar  joe s be the only place for steve 
  gar  you re right 
do you see  there s no way i can go
back to working out at my high school 
they d laugh at me there 
lock me in lockers  make me eat clay 
but not here  not at joe s 
i need this place 
you guys need this place  come on 
i got it  i know how we can raise the money 
  how 
  car wash 
what are the chances 
same day  right across the street 
the girls beat us fair and square 
i am gonna be a gentleman about it and
congratulate every one of them  personally 
guys  not to be a nay sayer or anything 
but the only customer we ve had
is that weird guy
who keeps paying justin to wash his truck 
that s it  boy 
get in there nice and deep  like 
  that s not good 
  gar  this sucks 
relax  justin  it s just a cutout 
at globo gym 
we re better than you and we know it 
sign up now 
do you smell that fitness  i do 
rock it and shock it  baby 
you gotta burn it to earn it 
  what s in the envelope 
  free 30 day memberships to globo gym 
  cool 
  it s ajoke  he sent it to us as an insult 
maybe we could sell  em for cash
cos the car wash cost us money 
  we re further away from saving this place 
  yes 
  we ll never raise enough money 
  this blows 
guys  i know this is tough to take 
but if an impromptu car wash
doesn t raise us the  50 000 we need 
i guess itjust isn t in the cards 
trust me here  if there was any way in
the world we could raise  50 000 in 30 days 
short of robbing a bank  i d do it 
we could sell blood and semen 
what  not mixed together 
guys  i love the enthusiasm 
i love the energy here 
but we re looking at this the wrong way 
let s celebrate the good times
that was joe s 
we gotta start looking at this irish wake style 
let me be the first
to say goodbye to average joe s 
we gave it a hell of a run  guys 
now let s try to have some fun 
i m gonna put on  the thong song  
and we ll tear this place apart 
wait  wait  peter  peter 
we could play dodgeball 
that s very nice  gordon  but everyone s
tired  playing a game isn t gonna help 
there s a tournament in las vegas 
i feel so dumb i didn t think about it before 
i read about
the las vegas international dodgeball open
every year in obscure sports quarterly 
of course  that s a totally common thing 
the best part is it s open to any team
that wins a regional qualifying match 
  how is dodgeball gonna get us the  50 000 
  they have a cash prize for the winner 
  how much 
   50 000 
guys  we are not gonna get  50 000
for playing dodgeball 
  why not 
  none of us know how to play dodgeball 
i do  we played it in pe last year 
they showed us this film about it 
  can you get your hands on that film 
  sure  i guess 
can we please try to be serious
here for one second 
you said anything we could do to raise
the money  this is that anything  this is it 
come on  show of hands 
who wants to play dodgeball 
come on 
come on  pete 
you guys had me at blood and semen 
come here 
you want it  don t you  fat boy 
you want that doughnut 
go ahead and have a bite 
just a little bite 
one little bite won t hurt you 
momma 
  sir  katherine veatch is here to see you 
  give me 30 seconds and send her in 
yes  sir 
thank you 
hello  katherine  good to see you 
i didn t know you were dropping by 
  you asked me to come over 
  did i 
are you reading the dictionary 
you caught me  i like to break
a mental sweat too  grab a chair 
so  i trust everything s going swimmingly
with our acquisition of average joe s 
so far  yeah  there s a lot to do over there 
so i should probably get back 
  that is a really interesting painting 
  thank you 
yeah  that s me  taking the bull by the horns 
it s how i handle my business 
it s a metaphor 
  i get it 
  but that actually happened  though 
anyway  we re a pretty tight knit tribe here 
but there s always room for one more squaw 
so  please  whatever you do 
don t think of me as your boss 
  i don t 
  i don t want to get into a formal thing 
i m white  you know 
w h i t 
e 
thanks  mr goodman 
but i m contracted by the bank 
they just assigned me to your account 
right  well  you work for the bank  bank
works for me so  ipso fact  i m your boss 
point is  i would love to see your pretty
little bone structure around here some more 
there s no reason we need to be shackled
by the strictures of
the employee employer relationship 
unless you re into that sort of thing 
in which case 
i got some shackles in the back 
i m just kidding 
but seriously  i ve got  em 
i m just doing my job  mr goodman 
in fact  i actually prefer it over there 
really  you like it with those freaks
over there in loser town 
they re not freaks 
they re people  just like you and me 
people 
 people  just like you and me  
oh  man 
that is what i love about you  kate 
you ve got a  personality  
that is rich  a real sauciness
that i find extremely attractive 
we should mate 
  what 
  date 
we should date some time  socially 
go out and kick it 
  are you ok 
  i m fine 
i just threw up in my mouth a little bit 
in some cultures  they only eat vomit 
i never been there 
but i read about it in a book 
i m sorry  mr goodman 
i don t date clients 
i get it 
don t crap where you eat  i understand 
me shell 
please escort ms veatch out 
and  katherine  make sure
my acquisition of that gym goes smoothly 
they re up to something over there 
i can smell it 
ûber american instructional films 
teaching america s youth since 1938 
hey  there  timmy 
holy mackerel  mister 
you scared the jeepers out of me 
how d you like to take a break
from that fine lead based paint 
and learn about dodgeball 
boy  would i 
  where am i  mister 
  you re in a chinese opium den  timmy 
this is where dodgeball
was invented in the 15th century 
by opium addicted chinamen 
back then  the chinamen threw
severed human heads at each another
instead of the adaa approved balls
we use today 
adaa 
that s the american dodgeball
association of america 
dodgeball is played with six players
on each team  and six rubber balls 
the object of the game
is to eliminate the opposing players 
once all the players on one team are
eliminated  the opposing team wins 
wow  i can t wait
to get the fellas together and play 
hang on a second there  sport 
  patches o houlihan 
  that s right  timmy 
patches o houlihan  seven time adaa
all star is here to take you the rest of the way 
  jeepers  really 
  you betcha  champ 
if you catch a ball that s thrown at you
before it hits the ground 
the player who threw that ball is out 
not you 
plus  another player from your team
gets to come back into the game 
  it s a two player swing 
  thanks  patches 
i can t wait to start my own team at school 
attaboy  tiger 
but remember  dodgeball is a sport
of violence  exclusion and degradation 
so  when you re picking players in gym class 
remember to pick the bigger 
stronger kids for your team 
that way  you can all gang up
on the weaker ones  like winston here 
nice one  son 
you ll be an all star yet 
just remember the five ds of dodgeball 
dodge  duck  dip  dive and
dodge 
till next time 
this is patches o houlihan 
saying   take care of your balls
and they ll take care of you  
ok  guys  any questions  great 
i signed us up for the sub regional qualifier
tomorrow at the waldorf rec centre 
but we haven t even practised yet 
we have to qualify for the vegas open 
tomorrow s regional s our last chance 
everyone  just relax  i ve always found
the best way to learn a sport is by playing it 
if anyone needs me 
i ll be in my office doing mad libs 
thanks  peter  appreciate that a lot 
ok  i think everybody knows   
  don t you have an office of your own 
  yes  i do have an office 
a very nice office
with a view and air conditioning 
  rub it in 
  what i don t have in my office is a closet
of 30 years of financial transactions 
devoid of any filing system known to man 
hard to believe i only got a semester
ofjunior college under my belt 
do you realise you haven t collected
any membership fees in 13 months 
i m curious  is it strictly apathy 
or do you really not have a goal in life 
i found that if you have a goal 
you might not reach it 
but if you don t have one 
then you are never disappointed 
i gotta tell you  it feels phenomenal 
i guess that makes sense  in a really sad way 
sad  you wanna know what s sad 
six grown men playing dodgeball 
since i m here  i m gonna go ahead
and do some abs  go shock it up 
i like to work out all the time
for this kind of sporting event

that s the only way to play 
hey  you guys take vitamins 
i take vitamins all the time

red rubber balls can save his sorry gym

unfortunately for troop 417 
during the adaa required
random drug screening 
one of your player s urine tested positive
for three separate types of anabolic steroids 
and a low grade beaver tranquilliser 
i m afraid  by rule 
your team must be disqualified 
goddamn you  bernice 
by the power vested in me 
i declare the winner of this year s
dodgeball regional qualifying tournament
and grammar jamboree to be
average joe s gym 
you lied 
all i m saying to you  kate  is that you can
admit the real reason why you showed up 
i was in the neighbourhood and
i thought you could use a cheering section 
kate  if you wannajoin the team 
all you have to do is ask 
thank you  peter  i don t 
it is obvious that you dig me 
  you re hooked on la fleur 
  god 
i ve been through this many times  i m sorry 
you can t stay away from me  i m so stupid 
i ll admit that  in spite of yourself  you have
brief moments where you re not completely

  go ahead  make yourjokes  mr
jokey    joke maker

hey  you

you want a dodgeball victory 
you ve gotta grab it by its haunches
and hump it into submission 
that s the only way 
ok  crazy guy  i m gonna go home now

the name s patches o houlihan 
i m your new coach 
patches o houlihan 
the guy from the dodgeball film 
  yeah  he said he wants to coach us 
  you said yes 
i figured the steady hand of a seasoned
dodgeball coach could only benefit us 
a iight 
but he s not weird or anything  is he 
no  no  he s totally normal 
i love the smell of queef in the morning 
i mean normal for us 
line up  ladies 
  what does he mean  line up 
  now 
if you re gonna learn to be
true dodgeballers

the five ds of dodgeball 
dodge  duck  dip  dive and dodge 
if you master the five ds 
no amount of balls on earth can hit you 
  queer bait  go ahead 
  me  or   
yeah  shouldn t we learn by dodging balls
that are thrown at us  or   
that s what this sack of wrenches is for 
if you can dodge a wrench 
you can dodge a ball 
what 
any other questions 
my god 
yeah  patches  are you sure
that this is completely necessary 
necessary 
  is it necessary for me to drink my urine 
  probably not 
no  but i do it anyway
because it s sterile and i like the taste

and he told me that his team
really wants to win this one 
right  and the stage is set for
darwin s cruellest play to unfold 
so don t go anywhere  folks 
the schadenfreude is about to begin

  quit 
once i thought of quittin   when i had brain 
lung and testicular cancer at the same time 
but with the support of my friends
i got back on the bike
and i won the tour de france
five times in a row 
but i m sure you have a good reason to quit 
what are you dying from
that s keepin  you from the finals 
right now  it feels a little bit like shame 
if people never quit when the going got tough
they d have nothing to regret all their lives 
good luck to you  peter  i m sure

on the dodgeball court all tournament 
a blatant cheap shot from white goodman 
  that s court misconduct  that s a warning 
  come on  gimme a break 
  you ok 
  yeah  i m fine 
  jesus  are you sure 
  yeah  i m all right 
  it was an accident  i thought she was in play 
  not a chance 
we re sweating like greased monkeys 
i can t hold on to a ball 
sorry  miss  but you re out 
you gotta get off the court 
watch him  man 
  hey  peter 
  yeah 
kick his ass 
  here s the restart 
  players  to your positions 
looks like it s gonna be a two on one 
a ménage à trois of pain 
usually you pay double
for that kind of action  cotton 
you re playing ready dodgeball 
balls are at your feet 
ready  dodgeball 
it s a cat and mouse game  folks 
peter la fleur has gotta wait for his shot 
he gets the elimination 
my  globo gym wins 
a cinderella story cast asunder 
average joe s has come all this way
for nothing  absolutely nothing 
they re not gonna get anything  cotton 
no elimination  double fault 
you stepped over the line on the throw 
what  you gotta be out of your mind 
that is the worst call i ve ever seen 
i m out here busting my butt and you come in
with a bush league call like that  bullcrap 
adaa continuation rule 113 d  sir 
sudden death 
all right  bring it 
i don t believe it  folks  sudden death 
well  let me tell you 
a double fault final play elimination hasn t
occurred since the helsinki episode of 1919 
and i think we all remember
how that turned out 
ladies and gentlemen  it s the greatest
happening in sport  sudden death dodgeball 
pepper needs new shorts 
white  peter  this is sudden death 
only striking an opposing player eliminates
them  catching the ball does nothing 
both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times 
you may throw any time after my call 
understood 
ok  let s have a clean match 
good luck  gentlemen 
this is it  la loser 
you ready for the hurricane 
just don t go cryin  to mama when
i spank you in front of all these people 
you don t go crying to your daddy
after i wipe it up with your face 
  white 
  yeah 
  you look awful fat in those pants 
  players  to your positions 
this is about gamesmanship 
throw early and you re defenceless 
throw late and you re eliminated 
dilemma  thy name is dodgeball 
this sport doesn t build character 
it reveals it 
effin  a  cotton  effin  a 
come on  talk to me 
listen up  crotch stain 
remember your training
and trust your instincts 
you can do it  i believe in you 
bye bye 
right 
players  turn and step in 
what the hell s he doing 
i don t know 
get a load of this guy 
in 23 years of broadcasting
i thought i d seen it all  folks 
but it looks like peter la fleur
has actually blindfolded himself 
he will not be able to see very well  cotton 
ready 
dodgeball 
goodbye  peter 
i always knew you were weak 
air goodman  comin  at ya 
down goes goodman 
down goes goodman 
winner  average joe s 
do you believe in unlikelihoods 
average joe s shocking the dodgeball world
and upsetting globo gym
in the championship match 
unbelievable 
i have been to the great wall of china 
i have seen the pyramids of egypt 
i ve even witnessed a grown man
satisfy a camel 
but never in all my years as a sportscaster
have i witnessed something as improbable 
as impossible  as what we ve witnessed here 
the little team that could  average joe s
gymnasium  underdogs throughout 
stand before us  aglow 
as true dodgeball champions 
on behalf of the american dodgeball
association of america 
it is my honour to present to you
this cheque for  50 000 
what are you so happy about  la fleur 
none of this matters 
you signed your gym over to me last night 
remember  you lost  i won 
suck failure  freaks 
peter  is that true 
yeah  it s true 
it s true i sold average joe s to white 
it s true that every man has his price 
and it s also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned 
  now he s a philosophiser 
  excuse us  step aside  please 
your winnings  mr la fleur 
congratulations 
  right on time  i appreciate it  thank you 
  what is that  what winnings 
gosh  i totally forgot to tell you  i took the
 100 000 bribe that you gave me last night 
and i put it on us to win 
we were going off at 50 1 
anyone  top of your head 
what s 50 times  100 000 
 50 000 
 5 million  peter  are you kidding me 
surprise 
stick it in your ear  la fleur  i wouldn t sell
you your gym back for all king midas s silver 
the gym is mine  so you can take your band
of yellow bellied losers and crawl out of here 
you re right  i can t make you
sell average joe s to me 
so i guess i ll just take your advice
and invest in something 
  say the controlling stake of globo gym 
  that s preposterous  i d never allow it 
globo gym is a publicly traded company 
there s nothing you can do about it 
so i would control globo gym
and everything that globo gym owns 
which  as of last night  is average joe s gym 
i m your new boss  white 
you can t be my boss  nobody can 
i m my own boss  i created myself 
  you re fired  pal 
  you can t do anything to me 
you re going down  la fleur 
like a sweet muffin 
  another time  another time 
  you suck  la fleur 
give me that 
man  the blindfold was crazy 
peter 
look  it s steve the pirate 
i just wanted to tell you
that i thought about what you said  and
i guess you re right 
i m not really a pirate 
i don t know  steve 
if you re not a pirate 
who the hell am i gonna split
all that buried treasure with 
peter   
gar  steve 
we missed you 
hey  you
