you are very attractive for a banker
thank you im not a banker im a lawyer
really what kind of law
are you involved in pretty eyes
sexual harassment mostly
but i also handle real estate and tax law
which is why im here
this place is in default
no youre in foreclosure
you were in default
when we sent you delinquency notices
i thought those were just warnings
they were warnings
no one warned me what happens now
i make my payments out to somebody else
you have 30 days to pay the balance
of your mortgage or you lose your gym
perfect whats the damage
what do i owe you
personal cheque gonna be ok might have
to wait till the end of the month to cash her
i do have to switch some funds the charity
i like to work with is gonna take a hit
mr la fleur i can assure you
this is a very serious situation
yeah
this is extremely serious mrs veatch
its ms ill need to review all of your financial
statements and assess any tax liabilities
absolutely
i dont know how you say ms for mr
but if there was a ms mr
im a ms as well
you do keep financial records
invoices revenue reports taxable income
you kidding i got a closet full of em

no kidding
just out of curiosity
who would want to buy this place anyway
come on squeeze it squeeze it
yeah come on come on get it up
one more bitch one more bitch
yeah yeah
now youre my bitch
yeah
yeah baby
involuntary spasm
look at the show enjoy the show
this a bad time i could come back

womens locker room before you go home
refreshment
ive got protein paste carb laxative
suffocated kumquat perhaps
im trying to cut down on those
theyre good they are good
know what you mean
walk with me
hey brianna
cellulite seminar tomorrow 0600
nice job susie
you call that a situp
dont slack trevor
im watching you
theres a good energy in the gym
let me guess why youre here pete
because i bought out
the second mortgage on your gym
youve got 30 days to make 50000
or your gym becomes my gym
i know weve had our differences
is that what you call
sleeping with three of my female trainers
it was one night
or the stripogram you sent me
for the globo gym oneyear anniversary
it was meant to be congratulatory
it was also a man
lets not get hung up on details
were both professionals
really
last i heard my gym makes money
yours doesnt
my gyms worth over 4 million
your gym isnt worth four
i have shareholders
you havent even got cupholders
why would i want cupholders
the point is
globo gym is a beacon
of human physical perfection
a benchmark in the fitness community
your gym is a skid mark
on the underpants of society
see peter i wasnt born
expecting the world to do me any favours
i earned this body
and i built this temple
out of nothing more than
a little cando attitude and elbow grease
and a large inheritance
from my father earl goodman
so if i choose to level average joes to build
a parking structure for my members so be it
theres nothing you can do about it
in 30 days ill be bulldozing that shitheap
you call a gym into permanent nothingness
i can only hope that you and the mongrel
race that comprise your membership
are inside it when i do
show mr la fleur out
turn it up high reggie
i wanna burn
so thats the deal we got 30 days
to raise 50000 or average joes is history
i got ten minutes ill open it up to some qa
no need to raise your hands
its an open forum ok owen kick us off
yes peter  and im just spitballing here
but why dont we pay it off
in canadian dollars and save some money
just so you know if thats a route
you want to follow its 50000 american
it would be 70000 roughly canadian dollars
how are we gonna come up with 120000
owen you dont add them together
technically peter im sorry to say this
but its more like 73313
it doesnt matter we cant come up
with 50000 were screwed
gar
its an insurmountable amount of money
no its not insurmountable come on
we cantjust sit back
and let globo gym take us over
average joes is too important
where do you go
when your wife changes the locks
average joes
right
dwight owen what will you do
if joes goes under work at the airport
i aint working at no airport again
no cos you hated it
and steve where do you go
to do whatever it is that you do
gar joes be the only place for steve
gar youre right
do you see theres no way i can go
back to working out at my high school
theyd laugh at me there
lock me in lockers make me eat clay
but not here not at joes
i need this place
you guys need this place come on
i got it i know how we can raise the money
how
car wash
what are the chances
same day right across the street
the girls beat us fair and square
i am gonna be a gentleman about it and
congratulate every one of them personally
guys not to be a naysayer or anything
but the only customer weve had
is that weird guy
who keeps paying justin to wash his truck
thats it boy
get in there nice and deep like
thats not good
gar this sucks
relax justin its just a cutout
at globo gym
were better than you and we know it
sign up now
do you smell that fitness i do
rock it and shock it baby
you gotta burn it to earn it
whats in the envelope
free 30day memberships to globo gym
cool
its ajoke he sent it to us as an insult
maybe we could sell em for cash
cos the car wash cost us money
were further away from saving this place
yes
well never raise enough money
this blows
guys i know this is tough to take
but if an impromptu car wash
doesnt raise us the 50000 we need
i guess itjust isnt in the cards
trust me here if there was any way in
the world we could raise 50000 in 30 days
short of robbing a bank id do it
we could sell blood and semen
what not mixed together
guys i love the enthusiasm
i love the energy here
but were looking at this the wrong way
lets celebrate the good times
that was joes
we gotta start looking at this irishwake style
let me be the first
to say goodbye to average joes
we gave it a hell of a run guys
now lets try to have some fun
im gonna put on the thong song
and well tear this place apart
wait wait peter peter
we could play dodgeball
thats very nice gordon but everyones
tired playing a game isnt gonna help
theres a tournament in las vegas
i feel so dumb i didnt think about it before
i read about
the las vegas international dodgeball open
every year in obscure sports quarterly
of course thats a totally common thing
the best part is its open to any team
that wins a regional qualifying match
how is dodgeball gonna get us the 50000
they have a cash prize for the winner
how much
50000
guys we are not gonna get 50000
for playing dodgeball
why not
none of us know how to play dodgeball
i do we played it in pe last year
they showed us this film about it
can you get your hands on that film
sure i guess
can we please try to be serious
here for one second
you said anything we could do to raise
the money this is that anything this is it
come on show of hands
who wants to play dodgeball
come on
come on pete
you guys had me at blood and semen
come here
you want it dont you fat boy
you want that doughnut
go ahead and have a bite
just a little bite
one little bite wont hurt you
momma
sir katherine veatch is here to see you
give me 30 seconds and send her in
yes sir
thank you
hello katherine good to see you
i didnt know you were dropping by
you asked me to come over
did i
are you reading the dictionary
you caught me i like to break
a mental sweat too grab a chair
so i trust everythings going swimmingly
with our acquisition of average joes
so far yeah theres a lot to do over there
so i should probably get back
that is a really interesting painting
thank you
yeah thats me taking the bull by the horns
its how i handle my business
its a metaphor
i get it
but that actually happened though
anyway were a pretty tightknit tribe here
but theres always room for one more squaw
so please whatever you do
dont think of me as your boss
i dont
i dont want to get into a formal thing
im white you know
whit
e
thanks mr goodman
but im contracted by the bank
they just assigned me to your account
right well you work for the bank bank
works for me so ipso fact im your boss
point is i would love to see your pretty
little bone structure around here some more
theres no reason we need to be shackled
by the strictures of
the employeeemployer relationship
unless youre into that sort of thing
in which case
i got some shackles in the back
im just kidding
but seriously ive got em
im just doing my job mr goodman
in fact i actually prefer it over there
really you like it with those freaks
over there in losertown
theyre not freaks
theyre people just like you and me
people
people just like you and me
oh man
that is what i love about you kate
youve got a personality
that is rich a real sauciness
that i find extremely attractive
we should mate
what
date
we should date some time socially
go out and kick it
are you ok
im fine
i just threw up in my mouth a little bit
in some cultures they only eat vomit
i never been there
but i read about it in a book
im sorry mr goodman
i dont date clients
i get it
dont crap where you eat i understand
meshell
please escort ms veatch out
and katherine make sure
my acquisition of that gym goes smoothly
theyre up to something over there
i can smell it
ûberamerican instructional films
teaching americas youth since 1938
hey there timmy
holy mackerel mister
you scared the jeepers out of me
howd you like to take a break
from that fine leadbased paint
and learn about dodgeball
boy would i
where am i mister
youre in a chinese opium den timmy
this is where dodgeball
was invented in the 15th century
by opiumaddicted chinamen
back then the chinamen threw
severed human heads at each another
instead of the adaaapproved balls
we use today
adaa
thats the american dodgeball
association of america
dodgeball is played with six players
on each team and six rubber balls
the object of the game
is to eliminate the opposing players
once all the players on one team are
eliminated the opposing team wins
wow i cant wait
to get the fellas together and play
hang on a second there sport
patches ohoulihan
thats right timmy
patches ohoulihan seventime adaa
allstar is here to take you the rest of the way
jeepers really
you betcha champ
if you catch a ball thats thrown at you
before it hits the ground
the player who threw that ball is out
not you
plus another player from your team
gets to come back into the game
its a twoplayer swing
thanks patches
i cant wait to start my own team at school
attaboy tiger
but remember dodgeball is a sport
of violence exclusion and degradation
so when youre picking players in gym class
remember to pick the bigger
stronger kids for your team
that way you can all gang up
on the weaker ones like winston here
nice one son
youll be an allstar yet
just remember the five ds of dodgeball
dodge duck dip dive and
dodge
till next time
this is patches ohoulihan
saying take care of your balls
and theyll take care of you
ok guys any questions great
i signed us up for the subregional qualifier
tomorrow at the waldorf rec centre
but we havent even practised yet
we have to qualify for the vegas open
tomorrows regionals our last chance
everyone just relax ive always found
the best way to learn a sport is by playing it
if anyone needs me
ill be in my office doing mad libs
thanks peter appreciate that a lot
ok i think everybody knows
dont you have an office of your own
yes i do have an office
a very nice office
with a view and airconditioning
rub it in
what i dont have in my office is a closet
of 30 years of financial transactions
devoid of any filing system known to man
hard to believe i only got a semester
ofjunior college under my belt
do you realise you havent collected
any membership fees in 13 months
im curious is it strictly apathy
or do you really not have a goal in life
i found that if you have a goal
you might not reach it
but if you dont have one
then you are never disappointed
i gotta tell you it feels phenomenal
i guess that makes sense in a really sad way
sad you wanna know whats sad
six grown men playing dodgeball
since im here im gonna go ahead
and do some abs go shock it up
i like to work out all the time
for this kind of sporting event
gotta be limber and loose
thats the only way to play
hey you guys take vitamins

dodgeball regional qualifying tournament

brief moments where youre not completely

a regional qualifying match
yeah now i remember
the dodgeball chancellors
an extremely personal friend of mine
i helped him shed some unwanted poundage
before beach season
so close your rule book
on that one poindextor
white we didnt come here to rumble
we came here to celebrate as a team
theres plenty of bar here
for you and the globonauts
team

your best player thinks hes a pirate
first of all he is way more
of a pirate than you will ever be
secondly we dont know who our best player
is yet weve only had one game

and hump it into submission
thats the only way

i aint crazy and i aint a guy
the names patches ohoulihan
im your new coach
patches ohoulihan
the guy from the dodgeball film

dodgeball coach could only benefit us

no no hes totally normal
i love the smell of queef in the morning
i mean normal for us
line up ladies
what does he mean line up
now
if youre gonna learn to be
true dodgeballers

the five ds of dodgeball
dodge duck dip dive and dodge
if you master the five ds
no amount of balls on earth can hit you
queer bait go ahead

that are thrown at us or

if you can dodge a wrench
you can dodge a ball

you stepped over the line on the throw

adaa continuation rule 113d sir
sudden death
all right bring it
i dont believe it folks sudden death
well let me tell you
a doublefault finalplay elimination hasnt
occurred since the helsinki episode of 1919
and i think we all remember
how that turned out
ladies and gentlemen its the greatest
happening in sport suddendeath dodgeball
pepper needs new shorts
white peter this is sudden death
only striking an opposing player eliminates
them catching the ball does nothing
both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times
you may throw any time after my call
understood
ok lets have a clean match
good luck gentlemen
this is it la loser
you ready for the hurricane
just dont go cryin to mama when
i spank you in front of all these people

goodbye peter
i always knew you were weak
air goodman comin at ya
down goes goodman
down goes goodman
winner average joes
do you believe in unlikelihoods
average joes shocking the dodgeball world
and upsetting globo gym
in the championship match
unbelievable
i have been to the great wall of china
i have seen the pyramids of egypt
ive even witnessed a grown man
satisfy a camel
but never in all my years as a sportscaster
have i witnessed something as improbable
as impossible as what weve witnessed here
the little team that could average joes
gymnasium underdogs throughout
stand before us aglow
as true dodgeball champions
on behalf of the american dodgeball
association of america
it is my honour to present to you
this cheque for 50000
what are you so happy about la fleur
none of this matters
you signed your gym over to me last night
remember you lost i won
suck failure freaks
peter is that true
yeah its true
its true i sold average joes to white
its true that every man has his price
and its also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned
now hes a philosophiser
excuse us step aside please
your winnings mr la fleur
congratulations
right on time i appreciate it thank you
what is that what winnings
gosh i totally forgot to tell you i took the
100000 bribe that you gave me last night
and i put it on us to win
we were going off at 501
anyone top of your head
whats 50 times 100000
5 million peter are you kidding me
surprise
stick it in your ear la fleur i wouldnt sell
you your gym back for all king midass silver
the gym is mine so you can take your band
of yellowbellied losers and crawl out of here
youre right i cant make you
sell average joes to me
so i guess ill just take your advice
and invest in something
say the controlling stake of globo gym
thats preposterous id never allow it
globo gym is a publicly traded company
theres nothing you can do about it
so i would control globo gym
and everything that globo gym owns
which as of last night is average joes gym
im your new boss white
you cant be my boss nobody can
im my own boss i created myself
youre fired pal
