yeah 
you the man  lance 
our work with these animals
has helped us develop
new antibiotics 
advanced pesticides
and a powerful new pheromone
which drives animals to mate
called compound h2o0 
it s a strong
sexual attractant 
a single drop is enough
to arouse any animal 
we plan on using it to breed
endangered species 
a special and indeed
often overlooked   
our most promising research
is with these dragonflies 
for example 
this dragonfly s skin
has a hard 
armor like exoskeleton
to defend against   
and this species
of dragonfly
has enormous strength
for its size 
it can lift vast amounts 
more than it s body weight 
and here we ve injected the dna
from all three species
into seven
new genetically enhanced
super dragonflies 
but there s
only six in there 
well  one missing dragonfly
is the least of my concerns 
i lost six tigers alone
last month 
ah 
this area is where
we keep our livestock 
ohh 
aren t you going
to do something 
soon as i get
this up on youtube 
i see  ye    well

lucille 
i have taught him everything i know
about being a man 
and a good man you are
after all these years
of marriage

sure  you re
a little older 
your hair s grey 
you have crow s feet 
it takes you
an hour to pee 
your thighs look

someone threw up
on a hot sidewalk 
and you ve always had
a tiny penis 
well    what does it matter
when you re in love 
oh  rick 
we were wondering
where you were 
it s so late 
about time you got home 
your aunt was getting worried 
you can sleep late
in the morning 
but don t forget
to feed the fish 
attaboy

puberty is
a difficult time
in a young man s life

the wrong book

they made her watch three hours
of women s basketball 
  this is all my fault 
  rick  it was an armed robbery 
there was nothing
you could ve done 
i could ve stopped that guy
before he shot my uncle 
then there is blood
on your hands 
but that s not important  all that matters
is that you re here for him now 
  rick riker

is he gonna be okay 
well  i m not a betting man 
but if you want to put some money on it 
  i ll take  dead in a week  
  oh my god

but this should take
the edge off of it 
here we go 
nice and easy 
  that s your vein 
  yes  i know 
first my parents and now this 
i m nothing
but a screw up 
yes  your life has been
a testament to that

rick 
rick

to help people
with special talents
like yours 
our students here learn to harness
their incredible talents 
and use them to advance
the common good 
ah  ow 
here we have children
who can walk through walls 
we have children who think they can
walk through walls 
some faces may be familiar 
like wolverine 
other mutants you probably
didn t know existed 
like sneezo 
most of our students
are born with their powers 
some  like you 
gain them later in life 
  oh  is that   
  yes  it is 
when he came to this school 
he weighed 130 lbs 
take enough roids 
you could do anything 
back up off those pills  barry 
  why have you brought me here 
  because you have the potential
  to be the best 
  but i can t even fly 
once you understand
the true nature of heroism 
you will fly 
but first i must teach you
the secret
to becoming a superhero 
hey  storm  you look
like you putting on a little weight

now i m assuming
that the material is
see through  right 
yeah  dude  i ma tell you something 
rick  this is good 
i m impressed 
like really impressed 
hey  that s my spot 
you re sitting on my gargoyle 
move it 
  excuse me 
  what are you even doing here 
i m looking seriously
out over the city
in a squatting position 
well  that s what i do here

i can fly 
this just in 
tom cruise is dead 
world s most powerful man 
i have a feeling you might
disagree with that 
strom  do you have
my test results 
yes  sir 
whatever you re doing
to your    victims 
rejuvenates you 
but only for 24 hours 
hmmm 
what if i killed 28 people
in one session 
would that give me
a month to live 
if it were february  yes 
but only if your cells
could absorb
that much energy at once 
and they can t 
i m afraid
you have to kill each day
to live each day 
still a slave
to the tyranny of time 
there must be some answer 
there isn t 
unless   
unless you had
some cerillium 
then you could create
a device powerful enough
to draw the life force out
of thousands of people
and enhance your own
cellular capacity 
strom  you re a genius 
wikipedia 
but that s not important 
what is important is that you
don t have any cerillium 
besides  it s immoral 
we don t do that sort of thing 
we re a pharmaceutical
company 
wait a minute 
take a look 
hawking s lab is
in the physics building 
i could just
walk right in 
you re going
to steal cerillium 
no  not me 
i m a law abiding citizen 
but perhaps there s
someone inside me 
someone unfettered
by the rule of law 
someone who will 
at any cost  survive 
ow 
oh  glass in my eye 
glass in my eye 
  does it hurt 
  uh  yeah  it hurts 
well  if you could spread   
spread them with your fingers 
push your lids
with your fingers

your eyeball around

  yeah  once 
  what did you tell him 
well  i said   
i told him   
i told him   the thing
about jill is   
when you look in her eyes
and she looks back in yours   
  you know that
you d do anything
anything to be a better person
than you are 
so that   
  if you were ever
lucky enough to be with her 
you could earn every second
of her perfect   
  grace 
and her limitless beauty   
  and her unending love 
  don t cry 
  i m not 
my eyes are burning 
rick  i want you to know
that was the most
beautiful thing
anyone s ever said to me 
  scented candle 
  thank you 
rick  i m so confused  and yet   
  i know exactly
what i want 
sorry to drop in uninvited 
it s okay  we were hoping someone
would open a window 
it was getting stuffy
in here 
so this is the lair
of the dragonfly 
  how did you   
  no no no 
i m not here to fight you  i ve got
thousands of other people i plan to kill 
this little visit
is just to show you
who ll get hurt
if you get in my way 
never 
time to go 
the woman  lucille adams
of east empire city 
  was badly injured 
  how was she injured 
  badly 
  what about the dragonfly 
all i can tell you is this 
he didn t save
anyone tonight 
doctor  how is she 
i m afraid your aunt s
taken a turn for the worse 
she can t speak  she can t walk 
she had no control over her bowels 
that s    that s awful 
i know  i went ahead and set up
a myspace page for her
under  crazy shit machine  
she already has 40 friends 
wait a minute 
that s somebody else s aunt 
your aunt has no problem
with her bowels   
  oh  thank god 
   because she s dead 
i m truly sorry  rick 
but there is a silver lining 
your uncle came out
of his coma this morning 
he did 
yes  but you mustn t tell him about
your aunt just yet 
he s in a delicate mental state 
the slightest bit of bad news
could send him spiraling
right back into a coma 
i understand 
mr  adams 
you have a visitor 
  is it lucille 
  no  sir  it s not your dead wife 
it s your nephew rick 
remember  no bad news 
now  sir  here you go 
this is my bill 
  you did surgery on me 
  yes  sir  we confused you
with one of our
sex change patients 
but don t worry 
we didn t remove your penis 
we did cut your testicles off  but  well 
since your wife s dead 
you won t be
needing them anyway 
you just want
to keep his spirits up 
he ll land on his feet
in no time 
we are gathered today to say goodbye
  to lucille adams 
  goodbye 
and now the eulogy 
it s tragic to think this is the last time
that i can look
upon my wife s face 
god  lucille 
how could you take her from me 
i can t live without her 
ahhh 
lucille 
snookie lumps 
i m sorry  there s been
a terrible mistake 
  this is your wife 
  ah 
she is this man s wife 
give me five minutes 
  uncle albert 
  i m not finished 
you re one lucky guy 
now   
where s lucille 
ah  lucille 
i do have this coupon
for a cremation 
rick 
i am so sorry
for your loss 
what is it 
i know i said some things 
but now more than ever 
i realize   
we can never be together 
i don t believe you 
you love me  rick 
i know you do 
jill  trust me 
i m telling you this for your own good 
i don t love you 
you re no longer
in my five 
how could you 
  when i was young  
  i never needed anyone  
  makin  love
was just for fun  
  those days are gone  
  all by myself  
  don t wanna be  
  all by myself  
  anymore  
  all by myself  
  don t wanna be  
  all by myself   
  anymore  
  all by myself  
  don t want to be  
  all by myself  
  anymore  
  all by myself   
you can t keep
getting lucky  man 
you only beat me
by two strokes this time 
and the back nine
is what killed 
oh my god 
  look at this place 
  yo  what are you doing  man 
you gotta pull
yourself together  dude 
what s the point 
look at you   
eating junk food 
wearing fake beards 
and we found your costume
in the garbage outside 
yeah  well  i m not
the dragonfly anymore 
but you said the hourglass
was going to kill thousands of people 
i told you i m no hero 
all right  aunt lucille s dead 
i ve rejected the only girl
i ve ever loved
and i can t even fly 
i wish i d never been bitten
by that stupid dragonfly 
and maybe your father
shouldn t have given you this after all 
look at the words
your ancestors inscribed in that ring 
 honor  valor  sacrifice 
duty  commitment 
bravery  justice 
integrity  brotherhood 
self esteem  low prices 
affordable housing 
loose fitting pants 
cheap internet porn  
the rest is in latin 
rick  the hero s path
is dangerous 
you may fail or you may fly 
all that matters
is that you do it
for the best of reasons 
helping others  rick 
that s what makes you
a real hero 
maybe you re right 
but even if i wanted to stop
the hourglass 
i wouldn t know
where to start 
i mean  where s he gonna
find thousands of people in one place 
look 
reporting here live from the
empire city convention center
where thousands of people
are in one place 
but none of them
more important
than the attendees
of the world humanity awards 
i ll drive 
well  that shortcut through the playground
sure saved us some time 
you go ahead 
i ll find
a place to park 
mister  please stop 
each year

to figure out who it is 
now the hourglass
could be anyone   
a guest of honor

a stagehand 
this may be nothing 
but i did see a man
with what looked like
a canister of
cerillium 
who 
  this year s lifetime achievement award   
  him 
   goes to one of the world s
greatest souls 
his holiness 
the dalai lama 
this man isn t who you think

to kill all these people
