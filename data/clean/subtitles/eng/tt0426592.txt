yeah
you the man lance
our work with these animals
has helped us develop
new antibiotics
advanced pesticides
and a powerful new pheromone
which drives animals to mate
called compound h2o0
its a strong
sexual attractant
a single drop is enough
to arouse any animal
we plan on using it to breed
endangered species
a special and indeed
often overlooked
our mostpromising research
is with these dragonflies
for example
this dragonflys skin
has a hard
armorlike exoskeleton
to defend against
and this species
of dragonfly
has enormous strength
for its size
it can lift vast amounts
more than its body weight
and here weve injected the dna
from all three species
into seven
new geneticallyenhanced
super dragonflies
but theres
only six in there
well one missing dragonfly
is the least of my concerns
i lost six tigers alone
last month
ah
this area is where
we keep our livestock
ohh
arent you going
to do something
soon as i get
this up on youtube
i see ye well
yes i understand
thank you

the principal
rick walked off

youve done
hes still so troubled

lucille
i have taught him everything i know
about being a man
and a good man you are
after all these years
of marriage
its like we first met
sure youre
a little older
your hairs grey
you have crows feet
it takes you
an hour to pee
your thighs look
like cottage cheese
someone threw up
on a hot sidewalk
and youve always had
a tiny penis
well what does it matter
when youre in love
oh rick
we were wondering
where you were

puberty is
a difficult time
in a young mans life

you dumb son of a bitch
my name is
professor xavier
and this is my school
i started it
to help people
with special talents
like yours
our students here learn to harness
their incredible talents
and use them to advance
the common good
ah ow
here we have children
who can walk through walls
we have children who think they can
walk through walls
some faces may be familiar
like wolverine
other mutants you probably
didnt know existed
like sneezo
most of our students
are born with their powers
some like you
gain them later in life
oh is that
yes it is
when he came to this school
he weighed 130 lbs
take enough roids
you could do anything
back up off those pills barry
why have you brought me here
because you have the potential
to be the best
but i cant even fly
once you understand
the true nature of heroism
you will fly
but first i must teach you
the secret
to becoming a superhero
hey storm you look
like you putting on a little weight
ah oh
so professor
about this secret
well you see
xavier
aw shit
well
you wanna explain
why i found her hiding in your closet
but pumpkin
i dont see nobody
oh you dont
ow
invisible girl
apparently not
invisible enough
if you knew how to take care of your man
maybe this wouldnt have happened
no she didnt
oh this bitch is crazy
im gonna have to
whip your ass
you dont say no disrespectful
what are you gonna do baldy
im everywhere
sweet cheeks
whoa

sex i ever had
how could you do this
to me to your kids

rick you uh

damn
dude youre like
a real superhero man
i love the mask
how you breathe

of air intake in the mask

that the material is
seethrough right
yeah dude ima tell you something
rick this is good
im impressed

hey thats my spot
youre sitting on my gargoyle
move it
excuse me
what are you even doing here
im looking seriously
out over the city

he cant
he cant even fly
the dragonfly
cant even fly
i can fly okay
i can fly
this just in
tom cruise is dead
worlds most powerful man
i have a feeling you might
disagree with that
strom do you have
my test results
yes sir
whatever youre doing
to your victims
rejuvenates you
but only for 24 hours
hmmm
what if i killed 28 people
in one session
would that give me
a month to live
if it were february yes
but only if your cells
could absorb
that much energy at once
and they cant
im afraid
you have to kill each day
to live each day
still a slave
to the tyranny of time
there must be some answer
there isnt
unless
unless you had
some cerillium
then you could create
a device powerful enough
to draw the lifeforce out
of thousands of people
and enhance your own
cellular capacity
strom youre a genius
wikipedia
but thats not important
what is important is that you
dont have any cerillium
besides its immoral
we dont do that sort of thing
were a pharmaceutical
company
wait a minute
take a look
hawkings lab is
in the physics building
i could just
walk right in
youre going
to steal cerillium
no not me
im a law abiding citizen
but perhaps theres
someone inside me
someone unfettered
by the rule of law
someone who will
at any cost survive
ow
oh glass in my eye
glass in my eye
does it hurt
uh yeah it hurts
well if you could spread
spread them with your fingers
push your lids
with your fingers
two two two fingers
are your fingers clean

oh thank god
because shes dead
im truly sorry rick
but there is a silver lining
your uncle came out
of his coma this morning
he did
yes but you mustnt tell him about
your aunt just yet
hes in a delicate mental state
the slightest bit of bad news
could send him spiraling
right back into a coma
i understand
mr adams
you have a visitor
is it lucille
no sir its not your dead wife
its your nephew rick
remember no bad news
now sir here you go
this is my bill
you did surgery on me
yes sir we confused you
with one of our
sexchange patients
but dont worry
we didnt remove your penis
we did cut your testicles off but well
since your wifes dead
you wont be
needing them anyway
you just want
to keep his spirits up
hell land on his feet
in no time
we are gathered today to say goodbye
to lucille adams
goodbye
and now the eulogy
its tragic to think this is the last time
that i can look
upon my wifes face
god lucille
how could you take her from me
i cant live without her
ahhh
lucille
snookie lumps

a terrible mistake

yo what are you doing man
you gotta pull
yourself together dude
whats the point
look at you
eating junk food
wearing fake beards
and we found your costume
in the garbage outside
yeah well im not
the dragonfly anymore
but you said the hourglass
was going to kill thousands of people
i told you im no hero
all right aunt lucilles dead
ive rejected the only girl
ive ever loved
and i cant even fly
i wish id never been bitten
by that stupid dragonfly
and maybe your father
shouldnt have given you this after all
look at the words
your ancestors inscribed in that ring
honor valor sacrifice
duty commitment
bravery justice
integrity brotherhood
selfesteem low prices
affordable housing
loosefitting pants
cheap internet porn
the rest is in latin
rick the heros path
is dangerous
you may fail or you may fly
all that matters
is that you do it
for the best of reasons
helping others rick
thats what makes you
a real hero
maybe youre right
but even if i wanted to stop
the hourglass
i wouldnt know
where to start
i mean wheres he gonna
find thousands of people in one place
look
reporting here live from the
empire city convention center
where thousands of people
are in one place
but none of them
more important
than the attendees
of the world humanity awards
