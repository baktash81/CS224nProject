chattering
phone rings
phyllis record american
youre gonna let that asshole bother you
you dont mind being called a fluke
by that jackass
let em sell their papers you still got
the biggest story in the city
sighs
loretta five women have been strangled
over the past three months
by number and by nature
these stranglings are beyond anything
ever seen before
in the criminal history of the city
the murders are clearly premeditated
all elderly
all lived alone its a pattern
loretta
the crimes themselves are insane
he ransacks the apartments
but doesnt take anything
he leaves his victims posed
with a bizarre air of ceremony
each left with a decorative garrote
around her neck
in every case
there is no evidence left behind
no clue as to how he selects his victims
he seems to come and go as he pleases
committing his crimes in broad daylight
professor
its highly organized behavior
probably escalated over time
and now hes lost control
barriers are down
hell almost certainly repeat
chattering
whats this
this is all for you two
jean
im one of the many who cant sleep
i find myself awake all night and too
frightened to leave during the day
every day is an eternity
every night a horror
nobody knows what a woman alone feels
no one knows fear as we know it
loretta there is but one answer
the boston phantom
the boston strangler must be caught
guess hes got a name now
shit
chattering
chuckles
mmm
thanks
so uh howd you become hollands girl
he poach you from one of the other papers
he got me a job
when i graduated high school
i was working at a lunch counter
down by the courthouse
he covered a trial
the summer before my senior year
i got to know him pretty well and so he
offered to get me a job when i turned 18
back then just living through the day
was an accomplishment
i wore my school clothes when they first
sent me out on assignments
i didnt have money for anything else
holland took pity on me
and lent me money for a new suit
i never wanted to let him down after that
i learned to hold my own
and he started sending me out
on bigger and bigger stories
and it just became my life
i really cant imagine
doing anything else
its crazy to think your whole life
can turn on a chance encounter
my senior year i uh
i lined up with all the other girls
to register for nursing school
but my english teacher mrs welker
she she pulled me out of the line
and had me apply for a scholarship
to go to college
and that was it
id be changing bedpans
if it wasnt for her
thank god for mrs welker
chuckles
chattering
jazz music playing on radio

and when i came back he was gone
what time was this
uh this afternoon three oclock
could you describe him for me
uh normal white guy dark hair
he had workmans clothes on
he just looked regular
professor on phone
she doesnt fit the pattern
to switch from all elderly women
to a young girl is unheard of
when these guys establish a type
it usually comes from a trauma
thats been years in the making
it doesnt just change all of a sudden
how sure are you
thats the going theory
with this type of killer
but no one really knows
did you know they were gonna do this
you really think this is smart
with that lunatic still out there
i dont know what to say all right

nielson yes
examiner did you have a relationship
with her outside of work

examiner did you see patricia
the night she was murdered
no
can i have an update detective
we caught nielson removing evidence
from patricias apartment
he failed two polygraph tests
but the da still doesnt think
he has a case
and theres nothing tying him
to the other murders
so what about daniel marsh
who the harvard psycho
hes batshit crazy ill give you that
but we got nothin on him
well he was harassing beverly
the week before she was killed
uh you cant charge a guy
for getting high
and calling his exgirlfriend
in the middle of the night
what so thats it
ii dont think you understand
what im dealin with here
im gettin a hundred tips a day
i got thousands of sex offenders
to screen
and now the commissioner just ordered
a raid on every gay bar in the city
im doing all i can
but im not playing with a full deck
ill see ya later
car door opens
how many gay bars in boston
are there anyway
there cant be that many
way to miss the point jack
the point is commissioner mcnamaras
not up to the job
what does that mean exactly
his heads shoved up his ass
they wont coordinate
with other police departments
connections are being missed
and good leads
are falling through the cracks
isnt some of that to be expected
loretta we are way beyond that
oh im sorry jack am i keeping you up

whats the story
the city cant protect its women
come on
what you dont think its true
or you dont think its a story
jack what is it with you
you cant go after someones livelihood

ten women are dead

phyllis on phone record american
detective yeah im looking for
loretta mclaughlin or jean cole
one minute please
phone rings
loretta
my names detective linski im with
the new york city police department
im calling about a murder we had
down here couple of weeks ago
looks like it could be linked
to the stranglings
older lady
yeah she turned up dead in a hotel room
strangled with stockings
tied around her neck
people from the hotel
saw the guy she was with
couple of nights later he shows up
at the hotel bar so i pick him up
scoffs find her cigarette case
still in his pocket
only took me 45 minutes
to get a confession
his name is paul dempsey
lives up in maine
but i can place him in boston
at the time of the first five murders
uh im assuming
you went to boston homicide with this
first call i made
couldnt get anyone to call me back
couple of weeks go by
so i make the trip up there myself
figure ill just tell em in person
couldnt get anyone to meet with me
can you believe that
detective drove four hours
for a homicide im working
id walk out of my kids christening
for that
i dont know what the hell
theyre doin up there
turns out paul dempsey was a suspect
in a murder in maine
four years
before the first strangler murder
the victim was an elderly woman
found strangled
with her stockings tied around her neck
it could be the original strangler murder
but no one can get boston homicide
to look into it
and this cop in new york
will go on the record
already did
were not running a hit job
on the police department
theyre blowing the investigation
how long can we keep ignoring it
i dont know how many times we have
to tell you but were not doing it
i dont know eddie
i mean shes right
we cant keep looking the other way
you really wanna use this paper
to tear down the police department
if anyone else was blowing it this badly
wed have put it on the front page
a long time ago
all right
you want to run with this
im not gonna stand in your way
but its your neck on the block
you understand
all right
thunder rumbling
loretta the boston police department
is conducting the largest manhunt
in the citys history
and yet no trace no trail
no trip up has been detected
without sharing evidence
police may overlook a common denominator
a missing link
a clue that could identify the killer
unless a centralized effort is set up
to catch the strangler
he will remain today
as he did one year ago
a faceless formless
flawless executioner
holy shit
tomorrows gonna be interesting
nice knowin ya fun while it lasted
newscaster on tv the attorney general
held a press conference today
to announce that he is assuming command
of the boston strangler investigation
after a critical story
in the record american
he has appointed
deputy attorney general john bottomly
to oversee the investigation
commentator on radio
to suggest the boston police department
is leaving any stone unturned is absurd
and all this
because a couple girl reporters question
the credentials of our police department
scoffs
i mean what the hell do they know
about police work
crickets chirping
wind howling

wind whistling

the green man and the measuring man
they called him the green man
cause he put on green workmans clothes
and posed as the maintenance guy
say he needed to check something
inside their apartments
loretta
and uh what about the measuring man
sergeant i dont know where he came up
with this one
but hed pretend to be a modeling scout
and hed convince these girls to let him
in so he could take their measurements
you wouldnt believe
how many people let him do it
he told me i had a nice figure
he said his agency would hire me
he just needed to take some measurements
but he didnt have a measuring tape
he just used his hands
i got this horrible feeling
my whole body just froze
church bells tolling
sighs
chattering
you remember sophies neighbor
jean mmhmm
uh she said a man came to her apartment
the day sophie was killed
now first he said he was there
to paint the apartment

if she ever thought about modeling
the green man slipped
into the measuring man its desalvo
chattering
host right this way

if you gotta call me at the station
you say youre my sister sally all right

he came to paint the apartment
but then he slipped up
and started talking to her about modeling
i mean those are the two cons
desalvo is famous for
i worked desalvo for weeks
i loved him for it its not him
what makes you so sure
he was in prison
for the first six murders
didnt get out
until after sophie was killed
whoever was in that ladys apartment
wasnt desalvo
sighs
what youre feeling right now
thats every day for me
you know how many people
ive gone down the rabbit hole with
its a deadend every time with this case
you get your teeth into something
and then your bottom falls out at three
in the morning and you got nothin

hes out there somewhere
laughing at us
thunderclap
rain pattering
sighs
rain continues
chattering
you still stuck on desalvo
everything lines up with him
his history
the progression of the crimes everything
jean except for the part where he was
in prison for the first six murders
have you seen the actual release records
sighs
sighs
sighs
look at this
oh my god
desalvo petitioned the judge
for early release
he said he had to get back
to his wife and kids
the judge let him out for good behavior
so he was out in time
two months before the first murder
a 33yearold father of two
is considered a prime suspect
in the boston strangler case
the suspect is presently confined
in a state mental hospital
for allegedly assaulting a woman
last december
we got beat
loretta who the hell is f lee bailey
a hotshot defense lawyer
one of those press hounds
how the hell did desalvo
get a hotshot lawyer
i dont know
you want me to go do your job for ya
chattering

loretta im writing a story
about how albert desalvo
got a highpriced defense lawyer
would someone familiar
with the investigation care to comment

loretta so what happened

reporter 2 hes telling the truth
bailey i obtained five details
only the killer could know
when i quizzed desalvo
he went five for five
reporter 3 mr bailey

to take his confession last night
bottomly interviewed him for five hours
and
no one knows he hasnt said a word
can i have a word please
ill catch up
whats going on with desalvo
nothing
if he confessed
why havent they charged him
bailey used you guys
to pressure the attorney general
and then he set one condition
for desalvos confession
yeah and whats that
theyre not allowed to use it in court
they didnt agree to that
they didnt have a choice
after you put desalvo on the front page
but they think they can get life
on the rape charges
and theyre just gonna ignore the fact
that 13 women were killed
thats all i got
and i havent even
told you the punch line yet
you know how baileys gettin paid
he got desalvo a fivefigure book deal

im not talking to reporters anymore
dont you want people to know the truth
i dont give a damn about that
ive got a family to support

a report just came over the wire
desalvo was killed in his cell sighs
im sorry kid
birds squawking
chattering
you get anything
stanley no official statement yet
my guys at the herald said
he got killed over drugs but
no that doesnt make any sense
reporters clamoring
he was in there with them
he knew what they were up to
phone rings
hello
i need you to take down an address
if i dont call back in an hour
give it to the police
what the hell are you doing
426 columbia road got it
got it
loretta
shit
doorbell buzzes
footsteps approaching
im lookin for harrison
hes down at the end of the hall
resident 1 coughing
resident 2 moaning
muffled thudding
loretta harrison
yeah
iim a reporter with the record american
i want to ask you some questions
about bridgewater
me and desalvo were in the same ward
i saw him every day
and what about him
yeah he was in my ward too
they were always together
marsh and desalvo
and nassar
george nassar
yeah the three of them were always
working on desalvos confession
wwhat do you mean working on
they coached him
they were at it every day for weeks
they had a stack of newspaper clippings
and they would quiz desalvo
about the details
i remember marsh sayin
you gotta get it so deep in your brain
that you believe it yourself
but what did they care
if desalvo confessed
reward money
thats why nassar got his lawyer involved
im not shittin you
hes willing to confess
to the whole thing
harrison
his lawyer organized the whole thing
you mean f lee bailey
thats right
he told albert that he could get him
a book deal make him rich and famous
albert thought he was gonna make
a million bucks off it
and support his family
you got a smoke
so you wanna know about albert
how did you know each other
we were cellmates
loretta before he confessed
yeah for a couple months
its an awfully strange coincidence
dont you think
youre the one
who gets picked out of the lineup
and you just happen to be
desalvos cellmate
maybe i just got one of those faces
were you in sophie clarks building
the day she was killed
no
i dont kill women
and i got no reason to lie about that now
im doin a life sentence
loretta then why did you coach desalvo
i wouldnt exactly call it that
i was just helpin him remember
thirteen murders
thats a lot to keep straight
why were you helping him
reward money ten grand a victim
so the more murders he confessed to
the more money youd make
well might as well take credit
for all of them
make a little extra money
it was a lot of extra money
and regardless of what you think
albert convinced me he killed those women
was it all 13
what does it really matter
see you all created a myth
and it needed to be stopped
people wanted to believe it was al
but they needed to believe
that it was albert
the alternative was just too disturbin
whats that
there are many albert desalvos out there
and your safe little world
is just a delusion
men kill women
it didnt start with albert
sure as hell doesnt end with him either
loretta if dr grayson was right
about these killers having a type
the first five murders
were all elderly women
and if paul dempsey had a type
shutter clicks
it was elderly women
loretta desalvo was a pathological liar
everything he knew about the first five
murders had either been in the papers
or it was given to him by bottomly
but of the hundreds of women
desalvo assaulted
all his victims were young
and then paul dempsey moves on
to new york
and the strangler starts killing
younger women
then other men use the strangler as cover
to get rid of women
they didnt want around anymore
the boss who got his secretary pregnant
the psychotic exboyfriend
then desalvo ends up at bridgewater
with nassar and marsh
they use desalvo
nassar gets f lee bailey involved
so he can claim the reward money
and they coached desalvo
before he confessed
he just became a convenient way out
for everybody else
the entire city just wanted to move on
nobody bothered to get to the truth
engine starts
and people got away with murder
jack its nice work kid
commissioner commissioner
what is your response to the story
in the record american today
commissioner what is your response
all the strangler murders
are still open cases
ill leave it at that
