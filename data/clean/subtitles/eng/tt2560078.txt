strangers to one another
in life  they became sisters in death 
each coming to the same horror filled
moment of murder by strangulation
by a killer who came quietly 
who is careful in his derangement 
and self possessed enough

 phyllis  record american 
you re gonna let that asshole bother you 
you don t mind being called a fluke 
by that jackass 
let  em sell their papers  you still got
the biggest story in the city 
 sighs 
 loretta  five women have been strangled
over the past three months 
by number and by nature 
these stranglings are beyond anything
ever seen before
in the criminal history of the city 
the murders are clearly premeditated 
all elderly 
all lived alone  it s a pattern 
 loretta 
the crimes themselves are insane 
he ransacks the apartments
but doesn t take anything 
he leaves his victims posed
with a bizarre air of ceremony 
each left with a decorative garrote
around her neck 
in every case 
there is no evidence left behind 
no clue as to how he selects his victims 
he seems to come and go as he pleases 
committing his crimes in broad daylight 
 professor 
it s highly organized behavior 
probably escalated over time 
and now he s lost control 
barriers are down 
he ll almost certainly repeat 
 chattering 
what s this 
this is all for you two 
 jean 
 i m one of the many who can t sleep 
i find myself awake all night and too
frightened to leave during the day  
 every day is an eternity 
every night a horror 
nobody knows what a woman alone feels  
 no one knows fear as we know it  
 loretta  there is but one answer 
the boston phantom   
the boston strangler must be caught 
guess he s got a name now 
shit 
   chattering 
   chuckles 
  mmm 
  thanks 
so  uh  how d you become holland s girl 
he poach you from one of the other papers 
he got me a job
when i graduated high school 
i was working at a lunch counter
down by the courthouse 
he covered a trial
the summer before my senior year 
i got to know him pretty well  and so he
offered to get me a job when i turned 18 
back then  just living through the day
was an accomplishment 
i wore my school clothes when they first
sent me out on assignments 
i didn t have money for anything else 
holland took pity on me
and lent me money for a new suit 
i never wanted to let him down after that 
i learned to hold my own 
and he started sending me out
on bigger and bigger stories 
and it just became my life 
i really can t imagine
doing anything else 
it s crazy to think your whole life
can turn on a chance encounter 
my senior year  i  uh   
i lined up with all the other girls
to register for nursing school 
but my english teacher  mrs  welker 
she    she pulled me out of the line
and had me apply for a scholarship
to go to college 
and that was it 
i d be changing bedpans
if it wasn t for her 
thank god for mrs  welker 
 chuckles 
   chattering

 shutter clicks 
hey  hey  asshole  come on  come on 
that s enough 
 scoffs 
 resident 
that guy came to my door earlier today 
he said he was here
to paint the apartment  so i let him in 
all of a sudden  he tells me i m pretty
and asks me if i thought about modeling 
i got nervous 
told him my husband was home 
i pretended to go back and get him 
and when i came back  he was gone 
what time was this 
uh  this afternoon  three o clock 
could you describe him for me 
uh  normal  white guy  dark hair 
he had workman s clothes on 
he just looked regular 
 professor on phone 
she doesn t fit the pattern 
to switch from all elderly women
to a young girl is unheard of 
when these guys establish a type 
it usually comes from a trauma
that s been years in the making 
it doesn t just change all of a sudden 
how sure are you 
that s the going theory
with this type of killer 
but no one really knows 
did you know they were gonna do this 
you really think this is smart 
with that lunatic still out there 
i don t know what to say  all right

one minute  please 
 phone rings 
loretta 
my name s detective linski  i m with
the new york city police department 
i m calling about a murder we had
down here couple of weeks ago 
looks like it could be linked
to the stranglings 
older lady 
yeah  she turned up dead in a hotel room 
strangled with stockings
tied around her neck 
people from the hotel
saw the guy she was with 
couple of nights later he shows up
at the hotel bar  so i pick him up   
 scoffs     find her cigarette case
still in his pocket 
only took me 45 minutes
to get a confession 
his name is paul dempsey 
lives up in maine 
but i can place him in boston
at the time of the first five murders 
uh  i m assuming
you went to boston homicide with this 
first call i made 
couldn t get anyone to call me back 
couple of weeks go by 
so i make the trip up there myself 
figure i ll just tell  em in person 
couldn t get anyone to meet with me 
can you believe that 
detective drove four hours
for a homicide i m working 
i d walk out of my kid s christening
for that 
i don t know what the hell
they re doin  up there 
turns out paul dempsey was a suspect
in a murder in maine
four years
before the first strangler murder 
the victim was an elderly woman
found strangled
with her stockings tied around her neck 
it could be the original strangler murder 
but no one can get boston homicide
to look into it 
and this cop in new york
will go on the record 
already did 
we re not running a hit job
on the police department 
they re blowing the investigation 
how long can we keep ignoring it 
i don t know how many times we have
to tell you  but we re not doing it 
i don t know  eddie 
i mean  she s right 
we can t keep looking the other way 
you really wanna use this paper

if anyone else was blowing it this badly 
we d have put it on the front page

but it s your neck on the block 
you understand 
all right 
 thunder rumbling 
 loretta  the boston police department
is conducting the largest manhunt
in the city s history 
and yet no trace  no trail 
no trip up has been detected 
without sharing evidence 
police may overlook a common denominator 
a missing link 
a clue that could identify the killer 
unless a centralized effort is set up
to catch the strangler 
he will remain today
as he did one year ago 
a faceless  formless 
flawless executioner 
holy shit 
tomorrow s gonna be interesting 
nice knowin  ya  fun while it lasted 
 newscaster on tv  the attorney general

of the boston strangler investigation
after a critical story
in the record american  
he has appointed
deputy attorney general john bottomly
to oversee the investigation 
 commentator on radio 
to suggest the boston police department
is leaving any stone unturned is absurd

they called him the green man
 cause he put on green workman s clothes
and posed as the maintenance guy 
say he needed to check something
inside their apartments 
 loretta 
and  uh  what about the measuring man 
 sergeant  i don t know where he came up
with this one 
but he d pretend to be a modeling scout 
and he d convince these girls to let him
in so he could take their measurements 
you wouldn t believe
how many people let him do it 
he told me i had a nice figure 
he said his agency would hire me 
he just needed to take some measurements 
but he didn t have a measuring tape 
he just used his hands 
i got this horrible feeling 
my whole body just froze 
 church bells tolling 
 sighs 
 chattering 
  you remember sophie s neighbor 
   jean  mm hmm 
uh  she said a man came to her apartment
the day sophie was killed 
now  first he said he was there
to paint the apartment 
and then he asked her
if she ever thought about modeling 
the green man slipped
into the measuring man  it s desalvo 
 chattering 
 host  right this way

if you gotta call me at the station 
you say you re my sister sally  all right

  well  it has to be him  look   
i mean  sophie s neighbor said
he came to paint the apartment 
but then he slipped up
and started talking to her about modeling 
i mean  those are the two cons
desalvo is famous for 
i worked desalvo for weeks 
i loved him for it  it s not him 
what makes you so sure 
he was in prison
for the first six murders 
didn t get out
until after sophie was killed 
whoever was in that lady s apartment

it s a dead end every time with this case

 jean  except for the part where he was
in prison for the first six murders 
have you seen the actual release records 
 sighs 
 sighs 
 sighs 
look at this 
oh  my god 
desalvo petitioned the judge
for early release 
he said he had to get back
to his wife and kids 
the judge let him out for good behavior 
so  he was out in time 
two months before the first murder 
a 33 year old father of two
is considered a prime suspect
in the boston strangler case 
the suspect is presently confined
in a state mental hospital
for allegedly assaulting a woman
last december 
we got beat 
 loretta  who the hell is f  lee bailey

 chattering

 loretta  i m writing a story
about how albert desalvo

would someone familiar
with the investigation care to comment 
no 
 loretta  so  what happened
when you went to question him 
 birds squawking 
 jim  bailey got to him first 
wouldn t let us interview him

 bailey  i obtained five details
only the killer could know

when you ve done as many interrogations as
i have  you develop an ear for bullshit 
 reporters laughing 
and was law enforcement
a part of this process 
that s all i m gonna say right now 
we re still negotiating his confession 
if you ll excuse me 
   shutter clicks 
   reporters clamoring

 bottomly  this is john bottomly 
the date is february 14th  1964 
albert  please state your full name

 bottomly  mr  desalvo  we are here today
because you intend to confess

 desalvo  yellow 
hear about desalvo 
no  what 
they sent bottomly
to take his confession last night 
bottomly interviewed him for five hours 
and 
no one knows  he hasn t said a word 
can i have a word  please 
i ll catch up 
what s going on with desalvo 
nothing 
if he confessed 
why haven t they charged him 
bailey used you guys
to pressure the attorney general 
and then he set one condition
for desalvo s confession 
  yeah  and what s that 
  they re not allowed to use it in court 
they didn t agree to that 
they didn t have a choice
after you put desalvo on the front page 
but they think they can get life
on the rape charges 
and they re just gonna ignore the fact
that 13 women were killed 
that s all i got 
and i haven t even
told you the punch line yet 
you know how bailey s gettin  paid 
he got desalvo a five figure book deal 
a tell all from the boston strangler 
everyone just wants it to be over

 grunting 
 groans 
 metal clanks 
 phone ringing 
 gasps 
hello 
hey  it s jack 
a report just came over the wire 
desalvo was killed in his cell   sighs 
i m sorry  kid 
 birds squawking 
 chattering 
you get anything 
 stanley  no official statement yet 
my guys at the herald said
he got killed over drugs  but   
no  that doesn t make any sense 
 reporters clamoring 
he was in there with them 
he knew what they were up to 
 phone rings 
hello 
i need you to take down an address 
if i don t call back in an hour 
give it to the police 
what the hell are you doing 
426 columbia road  got it 
got it 
loretta   
shit 
 doorbell buzzes 
 footsteps approaching 
i m lookin  for harrison 
he s down at the end of the hall 
 resident 1 coughing 
   resident 2 moaning 
   muffled thudding 
 loretta  harrison 
yeah 
i i m a reporter with the record american 
i want to ask you some questions
about bridgewater 
me and desalvo were in the same ward 
i saw him every day 
and what about    him 
yeah  he was in my ward too 
they were always together 
marsh and desalvo 
and nassar 
george nassar 
yeah  the three of them were always
working on desalvo s confession 
w what do you mean working on 
they coached him 
they were at it every day for weeks 
they had a stack of newspaper clippings 
and they would quiz desalvo
about the details 
i remember marsh sayin  
 you gotta get it so deep in your brain
that you believe it yourself  
but what did they care
if desalvo confessed 
reward money 
that s why nassar got his lawyer involved 
i m not shittin  you 
he s willing to confess
to the whole thing 
 harrison 
his lawyer organized the whole thing 
you mean f  lee bailey 
that s right 
he told albert that he could get him
a book deal  make him rich and famous 
albert thought he was gonna make
a million bucks off it
and support his family 
you got a smoke 
so  you wanna know about albert 
how did you know each other 
we were cellmates 
 loretta  before he confessed 
yeah  for a couple months 
it s an awfully strange coincidence 
don t you think 
you re the one
who gets picked out of the lineup 
and you just happen to be
desalvo s cellmate 
maybe i just got one of those faces 
were you in sophie clark s building
the day she was killed 
no 
i don t kill women 
and i got no reason to lie about that now 
i m doin  a life sentence 
 loretta  then why did you coach desalvo 
i wouldn t exactly call it that 
i was just helpin  him remember 
thirteen murders 
that s a lot to keep straight 
why were you helping him 
reward money  ten grand a victim 
so  the more murders he confessed to 
the more money you d make 
well  might as well take credit
for all of them 
make a little extra money 
it was a lot of extra money 
and regardless of what you think 
albert convinced me he killed those women 
was it all 13 
what does it really matter 
see  you all created a myth 
and it needed to be stopped 
people wanted to believe it was al 
but they needed to believe
that it was albert 
the alternative was just too disturbin  
what s that 
there are many albert desalvos out there 
and your safe little world
is just a delusion 
men kill women 
it didn t start with albert 
sure as hell doesn t end with him either 
 loretta  if dr  grayson was right
about these killers having a type   
the first five murders
were all elderly women 
  and if paul dempsey had a type   
   shutter clicks 
it was elderly women 
 loretta  desalvo was a pathological liar 
everything he knew about the first five
murders had either been in the papers 
or it was given to him by bottomly 
but of the hundreds of women
desalvo assaulted 
all his victims were young 
and then paul dempsey moves on
to new york 
and the strangler starts killing
younger women 
then other men use the strangler as cover
to get rid of women
they didn t want around anymore 
the boss who got his secretary pregnant 
the psychotic ex boyfriend 
then desalvo ends up at bridgewater
with nassar and marsh 
they use desalvo 
nassar gets f  lee bailey involved
so he can claim the reward money 
and they coached desalvo
before he confessed 
he just became a convenient way out
for everybody else 
the entire city just wanted to move on 
nobody bothered to get to the truth 
 engine starts 
and people got away with murder 
 jack  it s nice work  kid 
commissioner  commissioner 
what is your response to the story
in the record american today 
commissioner  what is your response 
all the strangler murders
are still open cases 
i ll leave it at that
