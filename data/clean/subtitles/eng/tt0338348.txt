fly faster than light   
   to get to every house in one night 
and to hold everyone s presents   
   his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner 
your brother said that  he was just
kidding you  he knows there s a santa 
he said he wasn t sure 
he wasn t sure if santa was for real 
of course santa is real 
he s as real as christmas itself 
but he won t come until you re
sound asleep  young lady

santa will be here before you know it 
so go to sleep 
 stark  barren 
devoid of life

when i say  jump

  they put me in charge 
  the engineer had to check the light

caribou 
there can be no christmas without
the polar express arriving on time 
am i the only one who understands that 
you  i should have known 
are you bound and determined that
this train never reaches the north pole 
but look 
caribou crossing  
i make that herd to be at least
100 000  maybe even a million 
it s gonna be hours
before they clear this track 
  a tough nut to crack 
  we are in some serious jelly 
  and a jam 
  tight spot 
  up a creek 
  up a tree 
  lost in the grass 
  i ll tell you what s grass  our a   
problem solved  all ahead  slow 
we re going pretty fast 
tell the engineer to slow down 
slow it down

jumping jeepers 
the cotter pin sheared off

  oh  no 
  oh  no 
  they can t hear me 
  they can t 
i don t like the look of this 
under the safety bar 
is everything all right 
what should we do 
considering we ve lost communication
with the engineer   
   we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive   
   the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably   
   and we are rapidly
approaching glacier gulch   
   which happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world   
   i suggest we all hold on   
   tightly 
  the pin 
  the pin 
jiminy christmas  the ice has frozen
over the tracks 
hold on  hold on  no  no

  just like that know it all kid 
watch your step 
tricky walking up here 
it s mighty slick 
mighty slick  i tell you 
there you go  what did i tell you 
years ago  on my first christmas eve run 
i was up on the roof making my rounds   
   when i slipped on the ice myself 
i reached out for a hand iron 
but it broke off  i slid and fell 
and yet  i did not fall off this train 
someone saved you 
or something 
an angel 
maybe 
wait  wait 
what did he look like  did you see him 
no  sir  but sometimes
seeing is believing 
and sometimes the most real things
in the world are the things we can t see 
the forsaken and the abandoned 
mind your step  now 
these poor toys have suffered enough   
   being left to rust and decay in the
back alleys and vacant lots of the world 
what are they doing here 
it s a new concept
the boss came up with 
instead of being thrown away 
they re collected  refurbished 
he calls it  rebicycling   
something like that 
makes me wanna cry   
   seeing toys that were
treated this way 
these hopelessly entangled
string puppets and marionettes   
   pose a particular problem  we found
the nimble fingers of our work force   
   here at the north pole are best
for working out those knots and tangles 
thank you  double locked here 
you are just like me  my friend 
a scrooge 
ebenezer scrooge 
north pole  santa claus  this train   
   it s all a bunch of humbug 
a bout of indigestion 
oh  yeah  i know what you are 
you re a doubter 
a doubter  you don t believe 
you re a doubter  you don t believe 
you missed it 
we rode down some really sharp hills 
we were on what looked like
a frozen lake 
but i know it was just
an optical illusion 
he said the train was on ice 
i said it s impossible   
you can t put a train track   
where you going now 
i m wishing on a star
and trying to believe
that even though it s far
he ll find me christmas eve
i guess that santa s busy
 cause he s never come around
i think of him
when christmas comes to town
the best time of the year
when everyone comes home
with all this christmas cheer
it s hard to be alone
putting up the christmas tree
with friends who come around
it s so much fun
when christmas comes to town
presents for the children
wrapped in red and green
all the things i ve heard about
but never really seen
no one will be sleeping
on the night of christmas eve
hoping santa s on his way
when santa s sleighbells ring
i listen all around
the herald angels sing
i never hear a sound
and all the dreams of children
once lost will all be found
that s all i want
when christmas comes to town
that s all i want
when christmas comes to town
look 
the northern lights 
hey  you three 
we just crossed it 
latitude 66 33  
the arctic circle 
and do you see 
those lights in the distance 
they look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea 
there   
   is the north pole 
it s a magic carpet on a rail
it never takes a rest
flying through
the mountains and the snow
you can ride for free and join the fun
if you just say yes
 cause that s the way things happen
on the polar express
whoo  whoo  the whistle blows
that s the sound of her singing
ding  ding  the bell will ring
golly  look at her go
