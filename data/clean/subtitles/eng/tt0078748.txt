heres some cornbread
i am cold
still with us brett
right
oh i feel dead
anybody ever tell you you yilook dead
oh yeah right
i just forgot something man
before we dock i think
we ought to discuss the bonus situation
brett and i we think we deserve full shares
mr parker and i feel the bonus situation
has never been on an equitable level
you get what youre contracted for
like everybody else
yes but everybody else gets more than us
dallas mother wants to talk to you
yeah i saw it
yellow lights for my eyes only
ok get dressed huh parker
i havent finished my coffee
its the only thing good on this ship
morning mother
right
ok
plug us in
thank you
where is earth
you should know
its not our system
scan
i cant believe this
contact traffic control
this is commercial towing vehicle yinostromo
out of the solomons
registration number 180924609
calling antarctica traffic control
do you read me over
commercial towing vehicle nostromo
out of the solomons
registration number 180924609
nothing
keep trying
calling antarctica traffic control
do you read me antarctica over
ive found it just short of zeta ii reticuli
we havent reached the outer rim yet
thats hard to believe
what the hell are we doing out here
dont know
what the hell are you talking about
thats not our system
i know that
do you ever notice
how they never come down here
this is where the work is right
same reason we get a half share to their one
our time is their time same old shit man
i think i know why they dont come down
its because of you you have no personality
you happen to be in my seat can i have it
yes of course sorry
whats happening now baby
well some of you may have figured out
were not home yet were only halfway there
what
mothers interrupted ourjourney course
why
shes programmed to do that
should certain conditions arise they have
it seems she has intercepted
a transmission of unknown origin
she got us up to check it out
a transmission out here
what kind of a transmission
acoustical beacon
that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds
sos
i dont know
human
unknown
so what
we are obligated under section
i hate to bring this up but this is
a commercial ship not a rescue ship
right
its not in my contract this kind of duty
and what about the money if you wanna
give me some money id be happy to oblige
lets go over the bonus situation
im sorry can i say something
there is a clause which states
any systematised transmission
indicating intelligent origin
must be investigated
i wanna go home and party
parker will you just listen to the man
on penalty of total forfeiture of shares
no money
well yeah
were going in
yeah were going in
can we all hear that lambert
good god
doesnt sound like any radio signal i know
maybe its a voice
well soon know can you home in on that
what was the position
all right it found the quadrant
ascension six minutes 20 seconds
declination 39 degrees two seconds
ok put that on the screen for me
all right well thats it
its a planetoid 1200 kilometres
its tiny
any rotation
about two hours
what about gravity
you can walk on it
approaching orbital apogee mark
equatorial orbit nailed
5 4
3 2
dors in line
status on the lifters
give me an ac pressure reading
48 seconds and counting
prepare to disengage from platform
20 seconds

1 lock
disengage
clear
moneys safe
lets take her down
roll 92 degrees port yaw
prime the port
im not getting anything
turbulence
locked and floating
you can drop us any time now
initial dampings going off hold on people
theres going to be a little bump
what the hell was that
pressure drop must have lost a shield
lets go with it
im still not getting anything
yeah dropping off now
still dropping
there we are weve got it
take her down
navigation lights on
9 8
7 6
5 4
3 2 1
kill drive engines
what the hell happened
somebody give me an answer
is the hull breached
i dont see anything we still have pressure
push the screen
why
secondary loadsharing unit is out
three of the four cells are gone
is that it
no hold on
we cant fix it out here anyway and
we need to reroute a couple of these ducts
drydock time
drydock tell him to drydock
we couldnt fix it out here anyway
weve gotta reroute all these ducts
in order to do that weve got to drydock
what else
some fragments caked up
weve got to clean it out and repressurise it
how long before were functional
look
17 hours tell her
at least 25 hours
get started ill be right down
what the hells she coming down here for
she better stay the fuck out of my way
any response yet
no absolutely nothing except
the same transmission every 12 seconds
all the other channels are dead
kick on the floods
we cant go anywhere in this
mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes
how far to the source of transmission
northeast just under 2000 metres
walking distance
can you give me an atmospheric
yes
its almost primordial
theres inert nitrogen high concentration
of carbon dioxide crystals methane
im working on the trace elements
anything else
yes theres rock lava base
deep cold well below the line
ill volunteer to be in the first group to go out
yeah that figures
you too lambert
swell
youd better break out the weapons
i cant see a goddamn thing
ash are you receiving
good contact on my board
clear and free keep the line open
lets go
hey ripley
hey ripley i want to ask you a question
if they find what theyre looking for
do we get full shares
dont worry parker
youll get whatevers coming to you
im not gonna do any more work
until we get this straightened out
brett youre guaranteed by law to get a share
what
why dont you just fuck off
what
what did you say rip
if you have any trouble
ill be on the bridge
hey ripley come back here
son of a bitch
whats the matter
cant see a goddamn thing
quit griping
i like griping
come on knock it off
ash can you see this
yes i can
ive never seen anything like it
its very bizarre
you said it
all right
moving on to second position
what is it
lets get outta here
weve got this far
we must go on we have to go on
will you say that again
shit
ash as you can see its hard to describe
im going back to the console
dallas
come on down here
theres something different here
i dont know what it is but if we can
get up that wall we can find out
alien life form
it looks like its been dead a long time
fossilised
looks like its grown out of the chair
bones are bent outward
like he exploded from inside
i wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew
lets get the hell outta here
dallas lambert come on over here
come on
what have you got
see what you make of this
it doesnt look like an sos
well i it looks like a warning
im gonna go out after them
whats the point
i mean by the time it takes to get there
theyll know if its a warning or not yes
are you ok down there
can you see anything
i dont know a cave
i dont know
but its like the goddamn tropics in here
what the hell is this
the pit is completely enclosed
and its full of leathery objects
like eggs or something
theres a layer of mist covering the eggs
that reacts when broken
kane are you all right
yeah im ok all right
im ok i just slipped
it appears to be completely sealed
wait a minute theres movement
it seems to have life organic life
are you there ripley
im right here
ok ripley im at the inner lock hatch
right
are you there ripley
were clean let us in
what happened to kane
something attached itself to him
what kind of thing
an organism open the hatch
if we let it in the ship could be infected
you know the quarantine procedure
24 hours for decontamination
he could die open the hatch
listen to me
we break quarantine we could all die
could you open the goddamn hatch
we have to get him inside
no i cant and if you were
in my position youd do the same
ripley this is an order
open that hatch do you hear me
yes
ripley this is an order do you hear me
yes i read you the answer is negative
inner hatch open
my god
what the hell is that
jesus christ
what is that man
hey how the hells he breathing
he still alive or what
and why dont you guys freeze him
how come they dont freeze him
whats going on in there
what the fuck is going on
you bitch
jesus christ
hey hey
you were gonna leave us out there
hey break it up
when i give an order
i expect to be obeyed
even if its against the law
youre goddamn right
she has a point
who the hell knows what that is
how are we gonna get that off of him
how are we gonna get it off
just a minute ill get some instruments
right now if i make an incision here
to try and remove
one of the digits from his face
youre gonna do what
finger ill try and get this finger off
get this cleating on there
its tearing his scalp
i know
its not coming off
without tearing his face off with it
well have to take a look at him inside
how come they dont freeze him
how come you guys dont freeze him
you can take your mask off
whats it got down his throat
i would suggest its feeding him oxygen
paralyses him puts him in a coma
then keeps him alive
what the hell is that
weve got to get it off him
just a minute
lets not be too hasty
we dont know anything about
it
were assuming its feeding him oxygen
if we remove it it could kill him
ill take that chance
lets cut it off him now
you take responsibility
yes yes get him out of there
where do you want to do this
well make an incision
just below the knuckle there
right here
stand by
good god
that craps gonna eat through the hull
i think its going to eat through
the goddamn hull come on
whats going on
this way
next deck
there it is
dont get under it
looks like its stopping
take a look at this man
brett give me your pen
give it to me quick
come on come on
dont get any on your arm
its stopped
i havent seen anything like that
except molecular acid
it must be using it for blood
its got a wonderful defence mechanism
you dont dare kill it
what about kane
heres your pen back
what do we do now
leave kane to ash you get back to work
oh what
ok
try it
damn it i felt sure that was it
try it again
feel like ive been in this place a month
we shouldnt have landed here
in the first place
we shouldnt have landed
on this damn ball i know that
the sooner we patch this thing up and
get outta here the sooner we can go home
this place gives me the creeps
its amazing what is it
id say its um
i dont know yet
do you want something
yes i uh
a little talk hows kane
hes holding no changes
and uh our guest
well as i said im still collating actually
but i have confirmed that hes got
an outer layer of protein polysaccharides
he has a funny habit of shedding his cells
and replacing them with polarised silicone
which gives him a prolonged resistance
to adverse environmental conditions
is that enough
thats plenty what does it mean
please dont do that thank you
im sorry
its an interesting combination of elements
making him a tough little son of a bitch
and you let him in
i was obeying a direct order remember
ash when dallas and kane are off the ship
yiim senior officer
oh yes i forgot
you also forgot the science divisions
basic quarantine law
no that i didnt forget
oh i see you just broke it
what would you have
done with kane hm
you knew his only chance of survival
was to get him in here
unfortunately by breaking quarantine
you risk everybodys life
maybe i should have left him outside
maybe ive jeopardised the rest of us
but it was a risk i was willing to take
its a pretty big risk for a science officer
its not exactly out of the manual is it
i do take my responsibilities
as seriously as you
you do yourjob
and let me do mine yes
wheres dallas
in the shuttle
why
somethings happened
serious
interesting
ripley meet me in the infirmary right away
where is it
well i dont know
we have to try and find it
lets check it
dallas please be careful
sorry
no not in the corner
have one of these just in case
kane
are you ok
i didnt see it was it in the overhead
it was up there somewhere
my god
cover the damn thing will you
its alive
weve got to have a look at this
excuse me
it seems dead enough
good lets get rid of it
ripley for gods sake this is the first time
weve encountered a species like this
it has to go back
all sorts of tests have to be made
ash are you kidding this thing bled acid
who knows what it will do when its dead
i think its safe to assume it isnt a zombie
dallas it has to go back
id soon as not burn it at the stake
but youre the science officer
its your decision ash
dallas
you wont make me change my mind
im not trying to change your mind
i just want you to listen
will you listen
how can you leave that decision to him
i just run the ship
anything scientific ash has the final word
how does that happen
thats what the company wants
since when is that standard procedure
standard procedure is to do what they say
whats happening with the repairs
theyre pretty much finished
why didnt you tell me
theres still some things to do
were blind on b and c decks
the reserve power systems blown
thats horseshit we can take off without that
we can you think thats a good idea
look i just wanna get the hell outta here
dust in the intakes
number twos overheating
spit on it for two minutes for christ sake
were hot and were getting hotter
engine room red clip status
one kilometre on ascension
engage artificial gravity
engaged
im altering the vector now
inhibit cng
struts retract
struts retracted
walk in the park
when we fix something it stays fixed
dont we brett baby
right
we should freeze him if hes got a disease
why dont we stop it there
we can get to a doctor back home
right
whenever he says yianything
you say right brett you know
right
parker your staffjust follows you around
and says right just like a parrot
shape up what are you a parrot
right
come on knock it off
kanes gonna have to go into quarantine
yes and so are we
how about something to lower your spirits
thrill me will you please
according to my calculations
based on time spent
give me the short version how far to earth
ten months
oh god
yes
dallas i think you should see kane
has his condition changed
its simpler if you come
were on our way
right
how are you feelin
how are you doing
terrific next silly question
oh thank you
do you remember anything about the planet
whats the last thing you do remember
i remember some horrible dream
about smothering and
anyway where are we
right here
were on our way home
back to the old freezerinos
ive got to have something to eat first
i need something to eat myself
one more meal before bedtime im buying
hey thats a break
the first thing im going to do
when i get back is to get some decent food
i can dig it ive eaten worse food than this

im trying
oh god
dallas
yeah

no
inner hatch sealed
anybody want to say anything
this is just an ordinary prod
like a cattle prod
its got a portable battery
its insulated from here to here
just make damn sure
nobody puts their hand on the end of it
it shouldnt damage the bastard
unless its skin is thinner than ours
but it will give him a little incentive
now we just have to find him
ive taken care of that
ive designed this tracking device
you just set it to search for a moving object
hasnt got much of a range but within
a certain distance it gives off a signal
what does it key on
micro changes in air density
gimme a demo
see and again
gotcha
two teams ash lambert and i
ripley you take parker and brett
catch it put it in the airlock get rid of it
the channels are open on all decks
i want you to communicate
keep in touch at all times
lets go
i thought you fixed 12 module
we did
i dont understand it
the circuits must have burned out
what have we got here
damn it hold your light over here
yeah thats it
i dont know if this is going to work
put this in there
right
check the insulation
shit
according to this its within five metres
micro changes in air density my ass
its within five metres
be careful
hey dont creep up on me with that thing
you guys stick together
whoa whoa now
what
parker brett its in this locker
in where
here take it
i got it i got it

brett
brett
brett
whatever it was it was big
no question its
its using the air ducts to move around
could he want brett alive
what
could brett be alive
no i mean i i dont think so
now this air shaft
may work to our advantage
it leads up to and comes out
in the main airlock
theres only one big opening along the way
we can cover that up and then we drive it
into the airlock and zap it into outer space
the son of a bitch is yihuge
i mean its like a man its big
kanes son
come on ash the science department
should be able to help how can we drive it
its adapted well to our atmosphere
considering its nutritional needs
but we dont know about temperature
ok temperature what if we change it
lets try it most animals retreat from fire
fire yeah parker can you rig
three or four incinerator units
who gets to go into the vent
i do
no
you and ash
take the main airlock
parker lambert you cover up
that maintenance opening please
im at the firstjunction
dallas im right here
parker
yeah
lambert
in position im trying to get a reading
the airlock is open
ok ripley
ready
all right ive got a reading on you now
open the hatch to the third junction
ok im through
im moving on
dallas hold on i think i got it
yes ive got it
where
its somewhere around the third junction
ok moving on
it is right around there
dallas youre gonna have to be careful
all right ive reached the third junction
and im going down
what the hells the matter with that box
dallas hold your position for a minute i
ive lost the signal

oh no youre out of your mind
you got a better idea
yes i say that we abandon the ship
we get the shuttle and get the hell out of here
and hope somebody picks us up
lambert shh
the shuttle wont take four
then why dont we draw straws
im not drawing any straws
im for killing it now
ok lets talk about killing it
its in the air shafts
will you listen to me parker shut up
lets hear it lets hear it
its using the air shafts
we dont know that
thats the only way
well move in pairs
well go step by step
and cut off every bulkhead and vent
until we have it cornered
then well blow it the fuck out into space
is that acceptable to you
if it means killing it yeah
but we have to stick together
how are our weapons
the weapons are fine
this one needs refuelling
will you get it please
ash go with him
no i can manage ash

because he may know how to kill it
ash can you hear me
yes i can hear you
what was your special order
you read it i thought it was clear
what was it
bring back life form priority one
all other priorities rescinded
the damn company
what about our lives you son of a bitch
i repeat all other priorities are rescinded
how do we kill it ash
theres gotta be a way of killing it
how do we do it
you cant
thats bullshit
you still dont understand
what youre dealing with do you
the perfect organism
its structural perfection
is matched only by its hostility
you admire it
i admire its purity
a survivor
unclouded
by conscience remorse
or delusions of morality
look ive heard enough of this
and im asking you to pull the plug
last word
i cant lie to you about your chances but
you have my sympathies
were gonna blow up the ship
well take our chances in the shuttle
blow up the ship
good
come on
when we throw the switches
how long do we have
ten minutes
no bullshit
or else we wont need no rocket
to fly through space
well need coolant for the air support system
you two go down and get all the coolant
you can carry ill get the shuttle ready
ill give you about
about seven minutes
come back up here ill shut the switches off
and well blow this fucker off into space
ready
take care of yourself
seven minutes
take it easy

final report
of the commercial starship yinostromo
third officer reporting
the other members of the crew
kane
lambert parker brett ash
and captain dallas  are dead
cargo and ship destroyed
i should reach the frontier in about six weeks
with a little luck
the network will pick me up
this is ripley
