here s some cornbread 
i am cold 
  still with us  brett 
  right 
  oh  i feel dead 
  anybody ever tell you you  y i look dead 
oh  yeah  right 
i just forgot something  man 
before we dock  i think
we ought to discuss the bonus situation 
brett and i  we think we deserve full shares 
mr parker and i feel the bonus situation
has never been on an equitable level 
you get what you re contracted for 
like everybody else 
yes  but everybody else gets more than us 
dallas  mother wants to talk to you 
yeah  i saw it 
yellow light s for my eyes only 
ok  get dressed  huh  parker 
i haven t finished my coffee 
it s the only thing good on this ship 
morning  mother 
  right 
  ok 
plug us in 
thank you 
  where is earth 
  you should know 
it s not our system 
scan 
i can t believe this 
contact traffic control 
this is commercial towing vehicle  y i nostromo 
out of the solomons 
registration number 180924609 
calling antarctica traffic control 
do you read me  over 
commercial towing vehicle nostromo 
out of the solomons 
registration number 180924609 
  nothing 
  keep trying 
calling antarctica traffic control 
do you read me  antarctica  over 
i ve found it  just short of zeta ii reticuli 
we haven t reached the outer rim yet 
that s hard to believe 
what the hell are we doing out here 
don t know 
what the hell are you talking about 
that s not our system 
i know that 
do you ever notice
how they never come down here 
this is where the work is  right 
same reason we get a half share to their one 
our time is their time  same old shit  man 
i think i know why they don t come down 
it s because of you  you have no personality 
  you happen to be in my seat  can i have it 
  yes  of course  sorry 
what s happening now  baby 
well  some of you may have figured out
we re not home yet  we re only halfway there 
  what 
  mother s interrupted ourjourney course 
why 
she s programmed to do that
should certain conditions arise  they have 
it seems she has intercepted
a transmission of unknown origin 
  she got us up to check it out 
  a transmission  out here 
what kind of a transmission 
acoustical beacon
that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds 
  sos 
  i don t know 
  human 
  unknown 
  so what 
  we are obligated under section   
i hate to bring this up  but this is
a commercial ship  not a rescue ship 
  right 
  it s not in my contract  this kind of duty 
and what about the money  if you wanna
give me some money  i d be happy to oblige 
let s go over the bonus situation 
i m sorry  can i say something 
there is a clause which states
 any systematised transmission
indicating intelligent origin
must be investigated   
i wanna go home and party 
parker  will you just listen to the man 
   on penalty of total forfeiture of shares  
no money 
  well  yeah 
  we re going in 
yeah  we re going in 
can we all hear that  lambert 
  good god 
  doesn t sound like any radio signal i know 
  maybe it s a voice 
  we ll soon know  can you home in on that 
what was the position 
6550 99 
all right  it found the quadrant 
ascension  six minutes  20 seconds 
declination  39 degrees  two seconds 
ok  put that on the screen for me 
all right  well  that s it 
it s a planetoid  1200 kilometres 
  it s tiny 
  any rotation 
  about two hours 
  what about gravity 
0 86 
you can walk on it 
approaching orbital apogee  mark 
equatorial orbit nailed 
5  4 
3  2 
1 
dor s in line 
  status on the lifters 
  give me an ac pressure reading 
48 seconds and counting 
prepare to disengage from platform 
20 seconds 
18  17   
12  11  10 
9  8  7 
6  5  4 
3  2 
1  lock 
disengage 
clear 
money s safe 
let s take her down 
  roll 92 degrees  port yaw 
  prime the port 
i m not getting anything 
turbulence 
locked and floating 
you can drop us any time now 
initial damping s going off  hold on  people 
there s going to be a little bump 
what the hell was that 
pressure drop  must have lost a shield 
let s go with it 
i m still not getting anything 
yeah  dropping off now 
still dropping 
there we are  we ve got it 
take her down 
navigation lights on 
9  8 
7  6 
5  4 
3  2  1 
kill drive engines 
what the hell happened 
  somebody give me an answer 
  is the hull breached 
i don t see anything  we still have pressure 
  push the screen 
  why 
secondary load sharing unit is out 
three of the four cells are gone 
  is that it 
  no  hold on 
we can t fix it out here anyway and
we need to reroute a couple of these ducts 
dry dock time 
dry dock  tell him to dry dock 
we couldn t fix it out here anyway 
we ve gotta reroute all these ducts 
in order to do that  we ve got to dry dock 
what else 
some fragments caked up 
we ve got to clean it out and repressurise it 
how long before we re functional 
  look   
  17 hours  tell her 
at least 25 hours 
get started  i ll be right down 
  what the hell s she coming down here for 
  she better stay the fuck out of my way 
any response yet 
no  absolutely nothing  except
the same transmission every 12 seconds 
all the other channels are dead 
kick on the floods 
we can t go anywhere in this 
mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes 
  how far to the source of transmission 
  northeast  just under 2 000 metres 
walking distance 
  can you give me an atmospheric 
  yes 
it s almost primordial 
there s inert nitrogen  high concentration
of carbon dioxide crystals  methane   
  i m working on the trace elements 
  anything else 
yes  there s rock  lava base 
deep cold  well below the line 
i ll volunteer to be in the first group to go out 
yeah  that figures 
  you  too  lambert 
  swell 
you d better break out the weapons 
  i can t see a goddamn thing 
  ash  are you receiving 
good contact on my board 
clear and free  keep the line open 
let s go 
hey  ripley 
hey  ripley  i want to ask you a question 
if they find what they re looking for 
do we get full shares 
don t worry  parker 
you ll get whatever s coming to you 
i m not gonna do any more work
until we get this straightened out 
brett  you re guaranteed by law to get a share 
  what 
  why don t you just fuck off 
  what 
  what did you say  rip 
if you have any trouble 
i ll be on the bridge 
hey  ripley  come back here 
  son of a bitch 
  what s the matter 
can t see a goddamn thing 
quit griping 
  i like griping 
  come on  knock it off 
  ash  can you see this 
  yes  i can 
i ve never seen anything like it 
it s very bizarre 
you said it 
all right 
moving on to second    position 
what is it 
let s get outta here 
we ve got this far 
we must go on  we have to go on 
will you say that again 
shit 
ash  as you can see  it s hard to describe 
i m going back to the console 
dallas 
come on down here 
there s something different here 
i don t know what it is  but if we can
get up that wall  we can find out 
alien life form 
it looks like it s been dead a long time 
fossilised 
looks like it s grown out of the chair 
bones are bent outward 
like he exploded from inside 
i wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew 
let s get the hell outta here 
dallas  lambert  come on over here 
come on 
  what have you got 
  see what you make of this 
it doesn t look like an sos 
well  i    it looks like a warning 
  i m gonna go out after them 
  what s the point 
i mean  by the time it takes to get there 
they ll know if it s a warning or not  yes 
are you ok down there 
  can you see anything 
  i don t know    a cave 
i don t know 
but it s like the goddamn tropics in here 
what the hell is this 
the pit is completely enclosed 
and it s full of leathery objects 
like eggs or something 
there s a layer of mist covering the eggs
that reacts when broken 
kane  are you all right 
yeah  i m ok  all right 
i m ok  i just slipped 
it appears to be completely sealed 
wait a minute  there s movement 
it seems to have life  organic life 
  are you there  ripley 
  i m right here 
  ok  ripley  i m at the inner lock hatch 
  right 
are you there  ripley 
we re clean  let us in 
  what happened to kane 
  something attached itself to him 
what kind of thing 
an organism  open the hatch 
if we let it in  the ship could be infected 
you know the quarantine procedure 
  24 hours for decontamination 
  he could die  open the hatch 
listen to me 
we break quarantine  we could all die 
could you open the goddamn hatch 
we have to get him inside 
no  i can t  and if you were
in my position you d do the same 
ripley  this is an order 
open that hatch  do you hear me 
  yes 
  ripley  this is an order  do you hear me 
yes  i read you  the answer is negative 
inner hatch open 
my god 
what the hell is that 
jesus christ 
what is that  man 
  hey  how the hell s he breathing 
  he still alive or what 
and why don t you guys freeze him 
how come they don t freeze him 
what s going on in there 
  what the fuck is going on 
  you bitch 
  jesus christ 
  hey  hey 
  you were gonna leave us out there 
  hey  break it up 
when i give an order 
i expect to be obeyed 
  even if it s against the law 
  you re goddamn right 
she has a point 
who the hell knows what that is 
how are we gonna get that off of him 
  how are we gonna get it off 
  just a minute  i ll get some instruments 
right  now  if i make an incision here
to try and remove
one of the digits from his face   
you re gonna do what 
finger  i ll try and get this finger off 
get this cleating on there   
  it s tearing his scalp 
  i know 
it s not coming off
without tearing his face off with it 
we ll have to take a look at him inside 
how come they don t freeze him 
how come you guys don t freeze him 
you can take your mask off 
  what s it got down his throat 
  i would suggest it s feeding him oxygen 
paralyses him  puts him in a coma 
then keeps him alive 
what the hell is that 
  we ve got to get it off him 
  just a minute 
let s not be too hasty 
we don t know anything about   
it 
we re assuming it s feeding him oxygen 
if we remove it  it could kill him 
i ll take that chance 
let s cut it off him now 
  you take responsibility 
  yes  yes  get him out of there 
where do you want to do this 
we ll make an incision
just below the knuckle there 
  right here 
  stand by 
good god 
that crap s gonna eat through the hull 
i think it s going to eat through
the goddamn hull  come on 
what s going on 
this way 
next deck 
there it is 
don t get under it 
looks like it s stopping 
take a look at this  man 
brett  give me your pen 
give it to me  quick 
come on  come on 
don t get any on your arm 
it s stopped 
i haven t seen anything like that 
except molecular acid 
it must be using it for blood 
it s got a wonderful defence mechanism 
you don t dare kill it 
what about kane 
here s your pen back 
  what do we do now 
  leave kane to ash  you get back to work 
oh    what    
ok 
try it 
  damn it  i felt sure that was it 
  try it again 
feel like i ve been in this place a month 
we shouldn t have landed here
in the first place 
we shouldn t have landed
on this damn ball  i know that 
the sooner we patch this thing up and
get outta here  the sooner we can go home 
this place gives me the creeps 
it s amazing  what is it 
i d say it s  um   
i don t know yet 
  do you want something 
  yes  i  uh   
a little talk  how s kane 
he s holding  no changes 
and  uh  our guest 
well  as i said  i m still collating  actually 
but i have confirmed that he s got
an outer layer of protein polysaccharides 
he has a funny habit of shedding his cells
and replacing them with polarised silicone 
which gives him a prolonged resistance
to adverse environmental conditions 
is that enough 
that s plenty  what does it mean 
  please don t do that  thank you 
  i m sorry 
it s an interesting combination of elements 
making him a    tough little son of a bitch 
and you let him in 
i was obeying a direct order  remember 
ash  when dallas and kane are off the ship 
 y i i m senior officer 
oh  yes  i forgot 
you also forgot the science division s
basic quarantine law 
  no  that i didn t forget 
  oh  i see  you just broke it 
what would you have
done with kane  hm 
you knew his only chance of survival
was to get him in here 
unfortunately  by breaking quarantine 
you risk everybody s life 
maybe i should have left him outside 
maybe i ve jeopardised the rest of us 
but it was a risk i was willing to take 
it s a pretty big risk for a science officer 
it s not exactly out of the manual  is it 
i do take my responsibilities
as seriously as you 
you do yourjob
and let me do mine  yes 
  where s dallas 
  in the shuttle 
  why 
  something s happened 
  serious 
  interesting 
ripley  meet me in the infirmary right away 
  where is it 
  well  i don t know 
  we have to try and find it 
  let s check it 
dallas  please be careful 
sorry 
no  not in the corner 
have one of these  just in case 
kane 
are you ok 
  i didn t see it  was it in the overhead 
  it was up there somewhere 
  my god 
  cover the damn thing  will you 
it s alive 
we ve got to have a look at this 
excuse me 
  it seems dead enough 
  good  let s get rid of it 
ripley  for god s sake  this is the first time
we ve encountered a species like this 
it has to go back 
all sorts of tests have to be made 
ash  are you kidding  this thing bled acid 
who knows what it will do when it s dead 
i think it s safe to assume it isn t a zombie 
dallas  it has to go back 
i d soon as not burn it at the stake 
but you re the science officer 
  it s your decision  ash 
  dallas 
  you won t make me change my mind   
  i m not trying to change your mind 
i just want you to listen   
will you listen 
  how can you leave that decision to him 
  i just run the ship 
anything scientific  ash has the final word 
  how does that happen 
  that s what the company wants 
  since when is that standard procedure 
  standard procedure is to do what they say 
  what s happening with the repairs 
  they re pretty much finished 
  why didn t you tell me 
  there s still some things to do 
we re blind on b and c decks 
the reserve power system s blown   
that s horseshit  we can take off without that 
  we can  you think that s a good idea 
  look  i just wanna get the hell outta here 
dust in the intakes 
number two s overheating 
spit on it for two minutes  for christ sake 
we re hot and we re getting hotter 
engine room  red clip status 
  one kilometre on ascension

  engaged 
  i m altering the vector    now 
inhibit cng 
  struts retract 
  struts retracted 
walk in the park 
when we fix something  it stays fixed 
don t we  brett  baby 
right 
we should freeze him  if he s got a disease 
why don t we stop it there 
  we can get to a doctor back home 
  right 
whenever he says  y i anything 
you say  right   brett  you know 
right 
parker  your staffjust follows you around
and says  right   just like a parrot 
  shape up  what are you  a parrot 
  right 
come on  knock it off 
  kane s gonna have to go into quarantine 
  yes  and so are we 
  how about something to lower your spirits 
  thrill me  will you  please 
according to my calculations 
based on time spent   
  give me the short version  how far to earth 
  ten months 
oh  god 
yes 
  dallas  i think you should see kane 
  has his condition changed 
  it s simpler if you come 
  we re on our way 
right 
how are you feelin  
  how are you doing 
  terrific  next silly question 
oh  thank you 
do you remember anything about the planet 
what s the last thing you do remember 
i remember some horrible dream
about smothering and   
anyway  where are we 
  right here 
  we re on our way home 
back to the old freezerinos 
  i ve got to have something to eat first 
  i need something to eat myself 
one more meal before bedtime  i m buying 
hey  that s a break 
the first thing i m going to do
when i get back is to get some decent food 
i can dig it  i ve eaten worse food than this 
but then i ve tasted better 
you pound down the stuff
like there s no tomorrow 
i d rather be eating something else 
but right now  i m thinking food 
you should know 
you know what it s made of 
i don t wanna talk about what it s made of 
i m eating this 
what s the matter  man 
the food ain t that bad  baby 
what s wrong 
what  what 
  this is serious 
  kane

  get it into his mouth 
  i m trying 
oh  god 
  dallas 
  yeah 
  anything 
  no  you 
nothing 
  did you see anything 
  no 
inner hatch sealed 
anybody want to say anything 
this is just an ordinary prod 
like a cattle prod 
it s got a portable battery 
it s insulated from here to here 
just make damn sure
nobody puts their hand on the end of it 
it shouldn t damage the bastard
unless its skin is thinner than ours 
but it will give him a little incentive 
now we just have to find him 
i ve taken care of that 
i ve designed this tracking device 
you just set it to search for a moving object 
hasn t got much of a range  but within
a certain distance  it gives off a signal 
what does it key on 
micro changes in air density 
gimme a demo 
see  and again   
gotcha 
two teams  ash  lambert and i 
ripley  you take parker and brett 
catch it  put it in the airlock  get rid of it 
the channels are open on all decks 
i want you to communicate 
keep in touch at all times 
let s go 
i thought you fixed 12 module 
we did 
i don t understand it 
the circuits must have burned out 
  what have we got here 
  damn it  hold your light over here 
yeah  that s it 
i don t know if this is going to work 
  put this in there 
  right 
check the insulation 
shit   
according to this  it s within five metres 
micro changes in air density  my ass 
it s within five metres 
be careful 
  hey  don t creep up on me with that thing 
  you guys stick together 
  whoa  whoa now   
  what 
parker  brett  it s in this locker 
in where 
here  take it

all right  parker  when i say 
  all right  now 
  easy 
  don t let him go 
  what the hell are you doing  man

hey  look  now  we had to bag it 
now we might pick it up on the tracker again 
  i ii    i ii   
  go and get it  man 
you get him  we ll go on

hey  i m not gonna hurt you  come on 
brett 
brett 
brett 
whatever it was  it was big 
no question  it s   
it s using the air ducts to move around 
could he want brett alive 
  what 
  could brett be alive 
no  i mean  i    i don t think so 
now  this air shaft
may work to our advantage 
it leads up to and comes out
in the main airlock 
there s only one big opening along the way 
we can cover that up and then we drive it
into the airlock and zap it into outer space 
the son of a bitch is  y i huge 
i mean  it s like a man  it s big 
kane s son 
come on  ash  the science department
should be able to help  how can we drive it 
it s adapted well to our atmosphere 
considering its nutritional needs 
but we don t know about temperature 
  ok  temperature  what if we change it 
  let s try it  most animals retreat from fire 
fire  yeah  parker  can you rig
three or four incinerator units 
  who gets to go into the vent 
  i do 
no 
you and ash 
take the main airlock 
parker  lambert  you cover up
that maintenance opening  please 
  i m at the firstjunction 
  dallas  i m right here 
  parker 
  yeah 
  lambert 
  in position  i m trying to get a reading 
  the airlock is open 
  ok  ripley 
ready 
all right  i ve got a reading on you now 
open the hatch to the third junction 
ok  i m through 
i m moving on 
dallas  hold on  i think i got it 
  yes  i ve got it 
  where 
it s somewhere around the third junction 
ok  moving on 
it is right around there 
dallas  you re gonna have to be careful 
all right  i ve reached the third junction
and i m going down 
what the hell s the matter with that box 
dallas  hold your position for a minute  i   
  i ve lost the signal 
  what 
you sure 
are you sure it s not there 
it s got to be around there 
check that out  lambert 
you may be getting interference 
dallas  are you sure
there s no sign of it  it is there 
it s gotta be around there 
dallas 
all right 
am i clear 
i wanna get the hell outta here 
oh  god  it s moving right towards you 
move  get out of there 
move 
dallas  move  dallas 
move  dallas  get out 
no  not that way  the other way 
dallas 
  no 
  take it easy 
dallas 
we found this laying there 
no blood 
no dallas 
nothing 
  i don t hear anybody sayin  nothing 
  i m thinking 
unless somebody has got a better idea 
we ll proceed with dallas s plan 
what   and end up like the others 
oh  no  you re out of your mind 
  you got a better idea 
  yes  i say that we abandon the ship 
we get the shuttle and get the hell out of here 
and hope somebody picks us up 
lambert  shh 
  the shuttle won t take four 
  then why don t we draw straws 
i m not drawing any straws 
i m for killing it now 
ok  let s talk about killing it 
it s in the air shafts   
will you listen to me  parker  shut up 
let s hear it  let s hear it 
  it s using the air shafts 
  we don t know that   
that s the only way 
we ll move in pairs 
we ll go step by step
and cut off every bulkhead and vent
until we have it cornered 
then we ll blow it the fuck out into space 
is that acceptable to you 
if it means killing it  yeah 
but we have to stick together 
  how are our weapons 
  the weapons are fine 
this one needs refuelling 
will you get it  please 
  ash  go with him 
  no  i can manage  ash 
don t follow me 
ash 
any suggestions from you or mother 
no  we re still collating 
you re what  you re still collating 
i find that hard to believe 
  what would you like me to do 
  just what you ve been doing  ash  nothing 
i ve got access to mother now 
and i ll get my own answers  thank you 
all right 
there is an explanation for this  you know 
i don t wanna hear
your goddamn explanation 
parker  lambert 
ash 
will you open the door 
let me by  ash 
what the hell are you doing 
get her up  get her up  get her up 
it s an android 
jesus   
it s a robot 
ash is a goddamn robot 
god 
holy shit 
help me get this fucking thing off 
god    oh  jesus   
oh  god  oh  god 
how come the company
sent us a goddamn robot 
they must have wanted the alien
for the weapons division 
he s been protecting it right along 
  parker  will you plug it in 
  um    i don t know   
because he may know how to kill it 
ash  can you hear me 
yes  i can hear you 
what was your special order 
you read it  i thought it was clear 
  what was it 
  bring back life form  priority one 
all other priorities rescinded 
the damn company 
what about our lives  you son of a bitch  
i repeat  all other priorities are rescinded 
how do we kill it  ash 
there s gotta be a way of killing it 
  how do we do it 
  you can t 
that s bullshit 
you still don t understand
what you re dealing with  do you 
the perfect organism 
its structural perfection
is matched only by its hostility 
you admire it 
i admire its purity 
a survivor 
unclouded
by conscience  remorse 
or delusions of morality 
look  i ve heard enough of this
and i m asking you to pull the plug 
last word 
i can t lie to you about your chances  but   
you have my sympathies 
we re gonna blow up the ship 
we ll take our chances in the shuttle 
  blow up the ship 
  good 
come on 
when we throw the switches 
how long do we have 
  ten minutes 
  no bullshit
