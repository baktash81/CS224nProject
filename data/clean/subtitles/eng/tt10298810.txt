this is that movie 
uncharted space
4 2 million light years from earth
star command sc 01 exploration vessel
crew  1200
buzz lightyear mission log 
star date 3901 
sensors have detected
potential life forms 
on an uncharted planet 
so  we re making a detour to investigate 
space rangers will make
initial evaluation 
then assess whether it s worth
waking the science crew
from their hyper sleep 
while the eric takes core samples
i will explore further the oddities
of this strange planet 
terrain seems a bit unstable 
no read out yet if the area is breathable 
there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere 
 who are you talking to 
 no one 
you were narrating again 
i was not  just doing the mission log 
you do know no one ever listens to them 
i know that  narrating
helps me with focus 
 stay sharp 
 yeah 
well  if it bothers you 
commander hawthorne 
i m happy to wait
back on the turnip 
please don t call it the turnip 
but the ship looks
like a root vegetable 
yes  you made that very clear
at the design review 
how long have you known
that i narrate 
forever 
since you and i were cadets 
speaking of 
you forgot to take the rookie with you 
ah  commander hawthorne  you know
how i feel about rookies 
it s the same way i feel about autopilots 
 how may i assist you 
is there anything i can do  sir  
they don t help 
they just over complicate things 
i m better off just doing the job myself 
which is why i brought the rookie 
hello 
 no 
 buzz  protocol requires we bring him along 
 he s gonna have sad eyes 
 buzz 
you know i can t deal with sad eyes 
 look at the rookie  buzz 
 no 
 look at the roo   look   
 no   no 
 lightyear 
 no 
 look at him 
 not looking 
 look  look 
 no 
 look at the rookie 
 no  no 
all right  all right  you win 
look  feather   featheringhamstan   
it s featheringhamstan  sir 
look  rookie  first 
you will not speak unless spoken to 
 yes  sir 
 still talking 
second  respect the suit 
this suit means something 
it s not just protecting your body 
it s protecting the universe 
this suit is a promise
to the world that you 
and you alone will
do one thing above all 
finnish the mission no matter the cost 
you will never quit  whatever
the galaxy may throw your way  
will you please turn that off 
it s just too easy 
you re mocking me  aren t you 
yeah  but in a supportive way 
look  what i m trying to say  commander 
is that you and i have this job down 
 sir 
 still talking 
at any moment i know what you re thinking 
i know where you re gonna be 
but this guy  i don t know 
where d he go 
you see 
this is exactly what i m talking about 
he s not helping  he s wandered off 
vines 
bugs 
the ship  it s sinking 
everyone  back to the turnip 
oh  so now it s the turnip 
engage stealth mode 
that should buy us enough time 
we re not gonna make it 
almost there 
okay  plan b  ready 
go 
 blast 
 here  i can re route it 
just give me a minute 
where is the   
help 
rookie 
help me 
buzz lightyear mission log 
the planet is clearly uninhabitable 
in fact  outright hostile 
the sentient foliage
have apprehended cadet furth feathering   
featheringston   feather   
they got the rookie 
who i strongly suggested
should not have joined in the first  
blast 
 buzz 
 now 
move it  ranger 
making our way back to the ship 
come on  buzz 
hurry 
all good at the engine room 
 i ll take the helm 
 and i will  
do nothing 
i ve got this 
how may i assist you 
autopilots 
 is there anything i can do  sir 
 no and no 
this is not a simulation

do you need my help

 are you sure 
i m buzz lightyear 
i m always sure 
s ub by su b  t
it s bad  buzz 
the hyper speed crystal
was totally destroyed 
long story short 
we re marooned 
i don t know 
what are you doing 
i m court martialing myself 
no  you re not 
commander hawthorne  i hereby
relieve myself of all space ranger duties 
this was my fault 
and these people deserve better 
you can throw me in the brig 
finish the mission  buzz 
that s what we do 
we re not done
until everyone gets home 
but we have no fuel crystal 
so we mine resources on this planet 
create a new crystal 
crystalic fusion is highly unstable 
then we test it 
no  it s too dangerous 
manufacturing a crystal
capable of hyper speed
is like trying to lasso with the sun 
and then someone would need
to attach that sun to a ship 
and then the ship needs someone to fly it
without blowing themselves into oblivion 
who in their right mind would

captain lightyear 
here is your specially formulated

diaz  you grew a beard 
how did you grow a beard 
oh  right 
first of  welcome back 
secondly   
wait 
wait  what is this 
how long was i gone 
four years  two months and three days 
what 
i thought we ve lost you  buzz 
alisha  what happened 
 time dilation 
 what 
time dilation is quite simple 
as you approached hyper speed 
your time slowed relative to our own 
so  during your mission
you aged only minutes 
while the rest of us
have aged years 
simply put 
the faster you fly  
the faster i fly
the further into the future i travel 
i get it 
so  what are we gonna do now 
i don t know 
but i think we should hold off
on any more test flights
until we ve figured out something else 
commander  we said finish the mission 
that s what space rangers do 
at what cost  buzz 
are you willing to lose another four years 
so  everyone is just stuck here
because of me 
hey  you all right 
yeah  yeah  i m fine 
wait  what s that 
oh  i got engaged 
oh  wow  that s great 
what s her name 
kiko  she s one of the science crew 
it s funny  it never would ve mattered
if we hadn t been stranded 
you got engaged to someone you just met 
buzz  i met her three years ago 
oh  right  right 
well  congratulations 
i d love to meet her 
well  there s plenty of time for that 
get some rest 
that s an order 
you re welcome 
alisha
hello  buzz 
i am sox 
your personal companion robot 
my what 
i was issued by star command
to ease your emotional transition
after your time away 
oh  that s very considerate of you 
robot feline 
but no thank you 
i m afraid it s protocol 
sensors indicate
you ve missed four birthdays 
would you like a frosted snack kit
to celebrate 
negative  that would compromise
my nutritional regiment 
we can talk about your feelings 
i am an excellent listener 
no  no  look 
i ve had a very long    day 
it did not go as planned 
the mission was unsuccessful 
affirmative 
oh  no  i am so sorry to hear that 
thank you  sox 
you re welcome  buzz 
shall we play a game 
 no  thank you 
 are you sure 
i can create a game specifically for you 
based on your exact personality profile 
hey  listen  sox  buddy  i m pretty tired

i m not giving up on my mission either 
great  so what can i do 
well  why won t you engage
with your mouse buddy 
is there anything more challenging 
you want a challenge  okay 
i guess you could work
on this fuel stability thing 
crystalic fusion  of course 
when should i expect you back 
about four years 
hold on  you don t have to do this 
commander  this is my mistake 
i need to make it right 
okay  but maybe
we should think about this 
think about what 
come on  we re space rangers 
we finish the mission 
well  it would be nice
to wear the suit again 
people are starting to forget
space rangers ever mattered 
well  i m about to fix that 
to infinity 
and beyond

happy 40th anniversary

hi  buzz 
you re back here

i missed you 
hi  grandma 
hey  sweetheart 
i m leaving a message

i was a big fan of your when i was a kid

yeah 
that was the last mission  buzz 
what 
we ve decided we gonna go ahead
and stay right here 
wait  here  negative 
that is not a viable option 
it is now  see  we re building this 
laser shield 
it ll keep all the creeters out 
and we ll just tuck right in here
and make do with what we ve got 
make do  no  wait 
but you don t understand  commander 
i can still do it 
i can get us outta here 
man  it s great you still believe that 
but we re good  buzz 
got the laser shield 
oh  hello  buzz 
buzz 
well  i ve got some good news  buzz 
i figured out the fuel problem 
what 
it was an interesting combination 
just the slightest variance 
but that made all the difference 
sox  how did you do this 
it took me 62 years  seven months
and five days 
and it s stable 
theoretically 
i look forward to finding out
on your next mission 
yeah   
what 
evening  captain  we re here
to pick up your companion robot 
what do you mean 
security purposes 
you understand 
no  actually  i don t

now  hold on  just   
at least let me do it

i plan to reach hyper speed
and this time finally finish the mission 
who are you talking to 
doesn t matter

to notify star command that you have gone  
star command was gonna decommission you 
 what 
 that s right

congratulations  captain lightyear 
you have achieved hyper speed 
we did it 
sox  we did it 
congratulations  buzz 
that was utterly terrifying 
and i regret having joined you

if you re anything like her 
you and i are gonna make  
    a great team 
    some robots cry 
okay   
so  get me up to speed on this 
right  the zurg ship showed up
about a week ago 
what s a zurg 
that s the only thing the robots say 
so that s what we call the big ship 
the zurg ship arrived 
the robots surrounded the base  and then   
citizens of t kani prime 
robot aliens have attacked 
everyone inside the perimeter 
look out 
we are activating
the laser shield immediately 
and that s the last we heard 
all these people 
they were counting on me 
and now they re trapped 
we ve tried to reach them 
but there s no communication  in or out 
sox 
meow meow 
she s correct 
did you check me against your cat 
well  he s not your standard issue feline 
actually  sox was a gift

he s purring 
he likes it 
sox  do you like it

i have a plan and i have a team 
come on 
all right  team  fall in 
i found a pilot 
operation surprise party is a go 
i like this  an elite squad

space ranger in the history of the corps 
it will be an honor
to work with you 
come on  gather round  team 
let s review our objectives 
kill the robots 
and don t die 
 don t die  is just something
you wanna do every day 
it s still an objective 
if i may  we have one objective 
we need to put this crystal
in the turnip and get outta here 
so  to do that we have
to get onto the base 
to do that we have to kill
all the robots 
to do that we have to destroy
the zurg ship 
and to do any of that
we have to not die 
deric
allow me to explain
operation surprise party 
it is a variation
on operation thunder spear 
didn t you get a medal for that one 
two  actually  but   
wait  how do you know
about operation thunder spear 
i ve read all my grandma s
space ranger books  from cover to cover 
twice 
excuse me  robot kitty 
oh  sorry 
sensors have indicated that the zurg ship
powers the robots on the ground 
so  we fly up there  we blow up the ship 
and surprise  robots 
you re toast 
then  we put your crystal in the turnip 
and finish the mission 
it s a good plan 
to infinity 
are you trying to get me
to pull your finger 
don t fall for it 
no  not like that  it was   
sorry  it s a thing your grandma
and i used to do 
ew 
i   we were never  
she didn t mean to   
anyway  forget it  moving on 
let s load these munitions
into the armadillo
and steel ourselves for combat 
operation surprise party is on 
buzz  do you hear that 
i hear something 
you think it s a robot 
nah  we ve never seen a robot
this far from the base 
i don t hear anything 
now i do 
zurg 
don t worry  we got you 
what 
training ammo
fear not 
the junior patrol has your back 
the junior what 
no  the ship

they came preloaded with a harpoon 
but i can t find  
oh  i found it 
i found the harpoons 
i m gonna reload it now  check this out 
did i get it 
a little to the left 
what 
did i get it 
you got it 
yes 
boom 
okay  okay  what exactly   how did that  
who are you 
we re the junior patrol 
at your service 
right  i m gonna need more information 
we are a volunteer team
of self motivated cadets 
we train one week in a month
here at the outpost 
mo and darby and i
were the first to arrive last weekend
when the robots showed up 
so  we cooked up
operation surprise party 
so  you are rookies 
boy  we d love to be rookies 
still building up to that 
okay  do you have munitions training 
 partial 
 tactical engagement 
 pending 
 combat experience 
yes  if you count the robot situation
we just went through 
okay  come on  sox 
what are you doing 
look  you seem nice people 
i m very supportive
of your training initiatives 
but i m gonna go ahead
and take it from here 
we just saved you from that robot 
 excuse me 
 mo made the kill shot 
mo got lucky 
very 
so  if you could just point me
in the direction of another ship 
there are operational spacecrafts
at the abandoned storage depot 
great  where is that 
the storage depot is directly adjacent
to the resource reconstituting center 
which is 4 2 kilometers
from your current location 
great  where is that 
it s actually quite simple 
okay 
you will first head south
towards the base 
after two stop lights you will  
wait  that is not right 
that is a dead end 
oh  i see  i was in the wrong spot 
apologies  i will start over 
you will first head south
towards the base 
after two stop lights
you ll take a gentle left and  
shoot  i have made another error 
we ll just show you 
allow me to restart 
you will first head south
towards the base 
after two stop lights
you ll take a hard right   
buzz lightyear supplemental mission log 
having finally achieved hyper speed
i now have an additional obstacle
in my way 
in order to flee this planet i ll have
to destroy a massive alien ship alone 
with no assistance of any kind 
you know  we can help you  it is our plan 
i can t allow that 
star command code 2709 3
forbids me from placing
unqualified personnel in harms way 
okay  but i m a hawthorne 
it s more than just a name  izzy 
you have to know exactly  
    how to react in any sit  
    what you gonna say next 
i thought i had that one 
okay 
and you  you re in a correctional
situation of some kind 
parole program 
i do this and they shave
a little time off my sentence 
but i really learned a lot in there 
darby can take any three things
and make them explode 
okay  and what about you 
me  i thought this was gonna be
like a fun boot camp workout thing 
but it is not 
so  i was actually coming out here
to turn in my stuff  
he s a quitter 
i m not a quitter 
you were quitting 
what are you talking about 
i was just going in a different direction 
yeah  the direction of a quitter 
you know what  i give up 
 see 
 on your right  
zurg 
now  where was i 
here we are  let me back up 
hey  keep working on your skills 
it s the only way to get better 
we can help you 
and i appreciate that 
just go back to your training facility 
stay alert  stay safe 
i m going to commandeer
this p 32 armadillo
and go blow up the zurg ship 
so  this is just goodbye 
affirmative  goodbye 
sorry  i forgot my cat 
life forms detected 
what are they 
giant insectoid organisms 
the building appears to be
some sort of hive 
are they a threat 
sensors indicate they are hibernating 
very good 
oh  look 
it s the xl 01 
it s been a long time since   
whoa 
what is it

finally 
sorry to interrupt

a real nice moment 
what are you doing here 
it s not safe 
you took the keys to our truck 
there they are 
come on  come on 
 quiet 
 i m trying 
got it 
 somebody get  
 get the door 
you were gonna say  get the door  
and i got the door 
well  i m gonna be blunt here 
i wish that hadn t happened 
so did the rest of us 
everyone grab a weapon 
boy  i d love to  but my parole  
as a star command officer
i grant you emergency authority 
we re gonna blast our way outta here 
now we re talking 
buzz  the probability of survival
a frontal attack is 38 2 percent 
seems a bit low 
what about stealth mode 
how do you know about stealth mode 
grandma and i used to play
stealth mode all the time 
it was like hide and seek 
but with a twist 
okay  well  it s actually good thinking 
i ll use stealth mode to disorient them 
or  and stick with me here 
we could all use stealth mode
and just walk right out 
you mean  you would wear
a space ranger suit 
this one already has my name on it 
okay 
let s review 
i m going  
that way 
and you re going  
that way 
okay  very good 
check it out 
i m feathers    feathering   
oh  look  a pen  cool 
 does yours have a pen 
 okay  pay attention 
stealth mode is fairly simple 
there are just two parts 
you press the button  
 is it this button 
 i will tell you which button 
 what about this button 
 i m sorry 
we re not gonna have time
to go over all the buttons 
okay  forget the button 
what about this thing 
 it s more  
 no  no 
that s the surrender strand 
you never pull that 
there is no more shameful maneuver
for a space ranger 
excuse me 
did i miss which button
is the stealth mode button 
it s this button 
not yet 
you push this button 
then you go out the front door 
and i ll go blow up the zurg ship 
 ready 
 ready 
no  wait  not ready  hang on 
okay  got  em 
that would ve been embarrassing 
okay 
goodbye again 
sox  you re inhibiting my visual 
sorry  is this better 
 negative 
 okay  how about this 
how about this 
okay  here we go 
very good 
stealth mode working as planned 
this is pretty cool 
these dumb bugs can t even see us 
hey  bug  hey  bug  bug 
i m right here  bug 
can t you see me 
he can t  he can t see me at all 
and time has elapsed 
wait  the timer 
they don t know about the timer 
you don t see me 
wait  i can see you 
i can see you too 
the bugs can see us 
no  no  i surrender 
pull 
back  back 
this isn t working 
you have to keep going 
we have to turn around 
they re headed right for us 
no  no  do not approach the vehicle 
all right 
 way to adapt  team 
 give it up here 
why are you congratulating yourselves 
because i just hawthorned us out
right outta that situation 
but you could ve made it if  
if you had told us
the stealth mode wears off 
well   
okay  everyone just strap in 
hello  i am your  
hold on 
are we going to space 
no  i m gonna drop you somewhere 
that was a big swirly turn 
i think i need a bag 
no  no  do not vomit
inside the vehicle 
i can see starts  that is space 
what is happening right now 
she s afraid of space 
 what 
 she should be  it s horrible
izzy  remember your exercises 
 it s coming 
 no  no 
engage your helmet 
that will catch it 
 buzz  another ship 
 izzy  i m trying  
i can t see anything 
oh  no  the dark side
of the planet 
over there  three o clock 
hold on  this isn t gonna be pretty 
is everyone okay 
i think so 
sox  give me a damage report 
one moment  please 
okay  this is better 
is this better 
no  obviously this is worse overall 
i just meant    you know   
how are you afraid of space 
oh  it s pretty easy 
did you know if you let go out there
you just keep going in the same direction
forever  just   
well  then how were you
going to blow up the zurg ship 
i would ve been ground support 
i know  grandma wasn t afraid of space 
no  because she was a space ranger 
astrophobia is an automatic
disqualification 
what was that thing 
 i don t know 
 is it gonna come back 
i don t know 
but how did it  
okay  you don t know 
i was done  i finally had the crystal 
this was supposed to be over 
but who am i kidding 
i don t need a crystal 
i need a time machine
to get out of this mess 
assessment complete 
how bad is that 
the blast was absorbed by the heat shield
and only caused a minor electrical short 
okay 
so  in order to be flight operational
the armadillo will require a material
of specialized capacitance 
oh  like an electrical thingy 
how do you know that 
we learned this 
specialized capacitance  remember 
we built those field radios last month 
oh  yeah  that was fun 
yeah  except darby messed hers up 
i m gonna mess you up  
please  i m trying to think here 
i messed mine up  but then i fixed it up 
but you broke that computer console 
i needed that little coil for its   
what was that 
specialized capacitance 
hey  honestly  there is
a lot of room out here 
if you guys wanna reminisce
you could go over there 
or look  there s no one
trying to think over there 
we can go up there 
fine  perfect 
yes  okay  new plan 
wait  what 
that mining facility
will have a console  right 
that console will have
a little coil thing  right 
and that little coil thing
will have the   
specialized capacitance 
that we need to fix this ship  right 
she s right 
good job  now that s thinking
like a hawthorne 
let s go get that part
and get outta here
before that thing finds us again 
whoa 
over there 
okay  here we go 
buzz lightyear mission log 
in order to repair our ship
we have to find some way
to get inside
the command center and   
nice job  elderly convict 
okay  the activation coil
should be in here 
sox 
need a pen 
got it 
okay  yeah  another time 
oh no 
security measures activated 
no  not this again 
not what  what is this 
a capture cone  that holds you
until they come and get you 
no one s coming to get us 
they re all trapped in the base 
so  we should just leave  right 
we can t just leave 
sure we can  take it from me 
we can always just leave 
look  see 
come on 
told you 
now  be careful  because these things  
combine if they touch 
all right  sorry 
but maybe if we both try it 
that s not gonna work 
you haven t even tried 
no 
meow 
yeah  that didn t work 
 buzz 
 whoa  hold on 
i m no help to anyone
if i m stuck in there with you 
sox  can you turn these off 
i can t reach the controls 
wait  there s a soft spot
in the floor here 
 maybe if we could  
 that s my foot 
 sorry 
 wait  watch it 
wait  that s it 
that thing powers these things 
 then let s hit it again 
 wait  wait 
we need the door to be open 
so i ll open this 
you slam into the power source 
these things will disappear 
and we ll walk right out 
 yes  sir

she didn t meant to be here  but she had
a whole life on this planet  buzz

the whole mission alone 
i can do it 
because you got a hawthorne right here 
and i appreciate that  tell you what 
i ll let you know if i need you 
but until then let s just try to get back
to the armadillo without any more  
run 
no 
what 
it s after me  go back to the ship 
but buzz 
buzz lightyear mission log 
i m being pursued by a   
just a massive robot 
i m leading it away
while the others escape to the ship 
buzz 
what  how do you know my name 
come with me 
what 
this is definitely
a violation of my parole 
come on  let s get outta here 
zurg 
ready yourselves for launch 
operation surprise party is back on 
what  with us 
what  am i gonna do
the whole mission alone 
we can t launch yet 
i need five minutes to install the coil 
we can t sit here for five minutes 
the ship still has hover capabilities 
then let s use them 
we might lose them
in the fire geysers 
blink the way 
you two  blast some robots 
but we haven t even finished
our munitions training 
how hard can it be  look 
we got these spiky things 
and these one probably explode 
just do whatever feels right 
what  what are you gonna do 
i m gonna dance with mister boom 
now that s satisfying 
twenty percent complete 
out of a hundred 
they re gaining on us 
where are those fire geysers 
dead ahead

watch out 
here  throw this

reboot  okay  be ready to launch
when the fuel cell is  
no 
oh  no 
blast 
grab the crystal 
no 
i   
buzz 
i m so sorry 
everything was happening so fast and i   
i just   
i made a mistake 
yeah 
okay  but we re not done  right

izzy  look around 
there is nothing to do 
the mission   
it s over 
buzz 
buzz 
where are you going 
i just need to be by myself 
no 
buzz 
buzz 
what the   
what is this 
where are we 
who are you 
now that s the question 
you look good  buzz 
dad 
guess again 
sox 
hello  buzz 
i don t understand 
i messed this all up 
hey  it was just a mistake 
remember what you told me 
this one s different 
why 
because it s mine 
i m supposed to be as good as my grandma 
i m supposed to be a hawthorne 
but i m not 
buzz 
wait a minute  hold on 
you re not me 
i am me 
you are you now 
but i m you 50 years from now 
well  there can t be two mes 
yet here we both are 
okay then  if you re me 
i m thinking of
a number between one and  
1273 
whoa 
zurg 
isn t that cute 
robots can t quite say  buzz  
so around here i m just zurg 
zurg 
and i guess so are you 
how  i don t understand 
do not worry about it 
none of this is gonna matter 
buzz 
yes 
you have to explain it all to him 
you re right 
i m sorry  it s just exciting 
you re finally here 
see  i reached hyper speed too 
hyper speed 
like you did 
but i wasn t greeted as a hero 
no  that new commander was gonna
arrest me for stealing the xl 15 
i d found a way to get them home 
and they didn t even care 
so i escaped 
i went as far as i could 
as fast as i could 
at that speed for that long
i d traveled centuries 
and i ended up in a future
you wouldn t recognize 
filled with technology you can t imagine 
and that s when it dawned on me 
if we can use this crystal
to go forward in time 
why not use it to go back 
but we can t go back in time 
 we can now 
 what 
listen  buzz  i ve broken time 
what s happening to you
never happened to me 
this is a new now that s never been lived 
you see  we can change things  buzz 
well  if we can go back in time
we can stop ourselves
from ever landing on that planet 
from ever hitting that mountain 
we can just continue the mission home 
and none of this
will have ever happened 
it s a good plan 
and this crystal is the key to it all 
wait  don t you already have one 
well  sort of 
see  i wore my crystal out
testing the time travel 
wore myself out too  it took a while 
turns out this isn t an exact science 
this is as far back in time
as i could get 
come on  help me configure the engine 
it should look familiar 
wait  is this based on the turnip 
set it for reversed thrusters  full 
so  we designed all of this 
no  this is all borrowed 
i just made some modifications 
she ll get to be
a space ranger again  buzz 
yeah 
although   
what 
well  she won t have her family 
she won t have izzy 
who s izzy 
look  she s not gonna miss anyone
if she never meets them
in the first place  right 
the only thing people are gonna know
is that we finished our mission 
here  hand me your crystal 
buzz 
i don t know  maybe   
maybe we should think about this 
think about what 
commander hawthorne believed
we could fix this mistake we made 
and that belief cost her everything 
oh  no  no 
we had that all wrong 
she had a whole life down there 
what kind of life 
we re supposed to be space rangers 
we suppose to matter 
you don t wanna live like this  buzz 
waking up with that same nightmare 
haunted by your mistake 
but you can finally let go of that 
starting right now 
you re right 
i can 
where are you going 
you and me  we re not the same 
i m sorry 
no  buzz 
i m sorry 
hey  cat 
do you know how to fly this thing 
there s no fuel 
see  this is why we should
never have gotten in over our heads 
what did you wanna do 
wait at the outpost
until the robots found us 
that s better
than being stranded out here 
where no one s ever gonna find us 
you are the last person i wanna be
stuck with in a life and death situation 
well  you re in luck  okay 
cause look around 
this is just a death situation 
meow meow 
i ve completely lost buzz 
he s too far away to track 
everybody  inside 
what 
get inside the ship 
what s after us now 
we don t have any more weapons 
it s okay  we re getting out of here 
where are we going 
we re going into space 
hey  let go of me  no 
i don t understand
what s happening here  buzz 
you ve changed 
and not for the better 
no 
you can t do this 
you re gonna erase it all 
exactly 
no  you gonna take away everything 
people s families  their friends 
my friends 
they have lives on that planet 
everyone does 
except for us 
i hardly recognize you  buzz 
all these new ideas   
you know what 
we ll go ahead and erase those too 
 whoa

i like this new you 
we have to destroy this ship 
can you get me to the bridge 
certainly  follow me 
zurg 
operation surprise party  here we go

we need to protect our escape ship 
so  don t let any robots
come through that door 
don t worry  we ll seal it off 
you go find buzz 
i ll track the chip in his dog tags 
meow meow 
what s wrong 
i m getting two buzz signals 
that s can t be right 
i ll triangulate 
that will get us close enough  come on 
a shortcut back 
this is pretty neat 
we have to go 
yep  all right 
oh  great 
i don t know any of these controls 
wait  i v a n  
yes  captain 
boy  am i glad to see you

in two minutes 
you got it

buzz  you don t want
any of this cool technology 
only you  buddy  come on 
 traitor 
 no 
enough 
just tell me where the crystal is

so  how do we close this door 
i don t know 
what  you said 
 don t worry we ll seal it off  
right  so don t worry  we will 
here we go 
look  see 
what 
meow meow

the signal says buzz is 50 meters away 
he s over there 
you think we re not the same  buzz 
you re already me

relative desperation 
i m a man of resources 
my weapon is ingenuity 
i can do anything 
can you not shout in my ear 
yep  sorry 
you re okay

you know  for the first time
in a long time
i feel like i am home 
zurg 
look out 
whoa 
stop right now 
lightyear 
you absconded with star command property 
stolen experimental spacecraft
and defied a direct order
from your commander 
i gotta throw you into stockade 
but i have other plans for you 
we want you to start a new version
of the space ranger corps 
universe protection division 
you re gonna be
a space ranger again  buzz 
you can hand select your team
from the very best of the zap patrol
and train them to your liking 
zap  zap 
well  that s very kind of you  sir 
but i m afraid
i m going to have to decline 
i already have my team 
these new suits are amazing 
arm blaster  rocket wings 
it could use a pen though 
i can t believe i m allowed to carry this 
i wish i had two of them 
you got a clean record 
and you re free and armed 
how are you still complaining 
i got off for good behavior 
not good attitude 
you know  i never wear pants 
but suddenly it feels weird
to not be wearing pants 
does it look weird without pants 
no  you look good 
i wish i could pull that off 
look  grandma  i m a space ranger 
just like you 
all right  team  we ve picked up a signal
in the gamma quadrant of sector 4 
we don t know what it is  but we re not
gonna wait for it to invade our home 
copy  commander 
you can count on us 
buzz lightyear mission log 
star date 4071 
as members
of the elite universe protection unit
of the space ranger corps 
we ve been charged to protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion
from any sworn enemies
