here s your suit 
do you know if your sister
slept in her room last night 
i don t know 
come on  peter  get up 
oh  charlie 
for god s sake  come on 
it was freezing last night 
that s how you get pneumonia 
that s okay 
okay  come on 
let s go  we re late 
your mother s
in the car already 
um   
it s heartening to see so many
strange new faces here today 
um  i know my mom
would be very touched
and probably a little
suspicious   
um  to see this turnout  so 
my mother was a very secretive
and private woman 
she had private rituals 
private friends 
private anxieties 
it honestly feels
like a betrayal
just to be standing here
talking about her 
she was a very difficult woman
to read 
if you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her 
and god forbid
you tried to confront that 
but when her life
was unpolluted 
she could be
the sweetest  warmest 
most loving person
in the world 
she was also
incredibly stubborn 
which maybe  explains me 
you could always count on her
to always have the answer 
and if
she ever was mistaken 
and well 
that was your opinion   
and you were wrong 
there aren t nuts in that 
  no 
  good 
does that have nuts   cause
we don t have the epipen 
i know 
hello  rexy  good dog 
shoes off  everybody 
charlie  shoes off 
it does feel weird 
yeah 
should i be sadder 
you should be
whatever you are  it ll come 
hey  how s it going 
mmm  just working 
taking a break
from avoiding the show 
so  you still toiling away
at the hospice 
yeah  between this
and the  uh  preschool 
so what s our deadline now 
seven months 
  six and a half 
  ooh  coming up 
any ideas for titles 
come in 
hey   
  goodnight  kiddo 
  goodnight 
are you  uh    are you feeling
okay about everything 
yeah  fine 
a little sad 
mmm   
yeah  i get it  i know 
  goodnight 
  night 
love you 
who s this 
that s grandma 
you know
you were her favorite  right 
even when
you were a little baby 
she wouldn t let me feed you
because she needed
to feed you 
drove me crazy 
she wanted me to be a boy 
you know  i was a tomboy
when i was growing up 
i hated dresses
and dolls and pink 
who s gonna take care of me 
um  excuse me 
you don t think
i m gonna take care of you 
but when you die 
well  then   
dad will take care of you 
or peter 
you never cried as a baby 
you know that 
even when you were born 
did you feel
like you wanted to cry today 
you think it might feel
like a relief 
goodnight  sweetheart 
mom 
i just scared myself
in the workshop 
with    with what 
no 
are you done 
almost 
so  maybe we finish the toy
after the quiz 
what do you think 
  okay 
  okay 
oh  my god  what was that 
so  if we go by the rule
that the hero is undone
by his fatal flaw 
what is heracles  flaw 
arrogance 
okay  why 
because he literally refuses
to look at all the signs
that are literally handed
to him the entire play 
okay  interesting 
so he thinks he has control 
but let s all remember 
sophocles wrote the oracle
so that it was unconditional 
meaning  heracles never had
any choice  right 
so does that make it
more tragic or less tragic
that if he has a choice 
  less 
  okay 
  why 
  because 
care to
weigh in  peter 
um  about which part 
i think it s more tragic
because if it s all
just inevitable 
then that means that
the characters had no hope 
they never had hope
because they re all just 
like  hopeless 
they re all like pawns
in this horrible 
hopeless machine 
  hello 
  hi 
did you go up
in my mom s room 
no 
mmm  door was open 
hello 
sorry  i know it s irrational 
  no problem 
  thank you 
hey  dad  it s the cemetery 
about what 
let me see 
hello  yes 
what does that mean 
desecrated 
but it s only been a week 
yes  okay  yes  sure 
all right  i understand 
yes   
uh  why don t i call you back 
yes  goodbye 
what was it 
uh  just some billing crap 
okay  well  i m  uh   
i m gonna go see a movie 
okay 
he would say
 i m a burden  i m a burden 
i m a burden  
and i would
tell him   no  no  
but yes 
he was a burden 
now we ve set aside
some time for any newcomers
who might like to speak 
so  anyone 
if it s your first
or second time with us 
the floor is open 
yes  would you like to   
maybe not 
okay  no pressure 
my name s annie 
hi  annie 
my mom died a week ago 
so i m just here
for trying it 
i have a lot of resistance
to things like this 
but i came to these
a couple years ago 
well  i was forced to come
and i guess it  um   
i guess it helped  so  um   
my mom was old and she wasn t
all together there at the end 
and we were pretty much
estranged before that 
so it really wasn t
a huge blow 
but i did love her 
and she didn t have
an easy life 
she had did  which became
extreme at the end 
and dementia 
and my father died when i was
a baby from starvation 
um  because he had
psychotic depression
and he starved himself 
which i m sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds 
and then there s my brother 
my older brother
had schizophrenia
and when he was 16
he hanged himself
in my mother s bedroom
and of course
the suicide note blamed her
accusing her of putting people
inside him  so 
that was my mom s life 
and then she lived
in our house
at the end before hospice 
we weren t even talking
before that 
i mean  we were
and then we weren t 
and then we were 
she s completely manipulative 
until my husband finally
enforced a no contact rule 
which lasted until i got
pregnant with my daughter 
i didn t let her
anywhere near me
when i had my first  my son 
which is why i gave her
my daughter 
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into 
and i just   
i felt guilty again 
i felt guilty again 
when she got sick 
not that she was really even
my mom at the end 
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything 
and i just don t want to put
any more stress on my family 
i m not even really sure
if they could   
could give me that support 
and i just   
i just feel like   
i just sometimes
feel like it s all ruined 
and then i realize
that i am to blame 
or not that i m to blame 
but i am blamed  i m   
and what do you think
you feel blamed for 
i don t know 
hey  what s

the smell of something wrong 
and then the body 
covered in black blood 
like tar 
and her head wasn t there
so i couldn t see her face 
but they were gone 
and her hands 
and her little finger nails 
how is your relationship
with your son 
  peter 
  hmm 
oh  god  um   
okay  i sleepwalk 
i mean  i haven t done it
in years  but  um   
a couple years ago 
i woke up
and i was standing
next to peter in charlie s bed
when they shared a room 
and they were
completely covered
in paint thinner 
and so was i 
from head to toe 
and i was standing there
with a box of matches
and an empty can
of paint thinner 
and i woke myself up
striking the match 
which also woke peter up 
and he started to scream 
and i immediately put
the match out 
like  immediately 
i mean  i was just
as shocked as he was 
and it was impossible
to convince them
that it was just sleepwalking 
which of course it was  but   
the timing was awful 
peter and i had gotten into
this stupid quarreling phase 
just forever arguing
about nothing  such   
frivolous stuff 
and peter always held it
against me 
and there was nothing
i can say
and nothing i can do
because it happened 
while i was asleep 
hey  that was quick 
did you bike all the way here 
um  no  actually my friend
drove me home 
oh  uh  by the way 
peter  have you  um   
have you signed up for that 
uh  sat prep course 
i ll do it tomorrow 
yeah  you know what 
you gotta do that
because it s coming up 
jesus christ  annie 
you re not planning on letting
him see that  are you 
  who 
  peter 
how do you think he s gonna
feel when he sees that 
what  it s not about him 
oh  no 
no  it s a neutral view
of the accident 
are you  uh  are you
coming down to dinner 
i m making dinner 
no  i made the dinner 
i came to get you 
come  stay  whatever you want 
i don t really give a shit 
this is really good  dad 
thanks  buddy 
you okay  mom 
what 
is there something
on your mind 
is there something
on your mind 
it just seems like there might
be something you wanna say 
  peter   
  like what 
i mean  why would i wanna
say something
so i can watch you
sneer at me 
sneer at you 
i don t ever sneer at you 
oh  sweetie 
you don t have to 
you get your point across 
okay  so fine  then say
what you wanna say then 
peter 
i don t wanna say anything 
i ve tried saying things 
okay  so try again 
release yourself 
oh  release you  you mean 
yeah  fine  release me 
just say it 
just fucking say it 
don t you swear at me 
you little shit 
don t you ever
raise your voice at me 
i am your mother 
do you understand 
all i do is worry and slave
and defend you 
and all i get back is that
fucking face on your face 
so full of disdain
and resentment
and always so annoyed 
well  now your sister is dead 
and i know you miss her 
and i know it was an accident
and i know you re in pain 
and i wish i could take that
away for you 
i wish i could shield you
from the knowledge
that you did what you did 
but your sister is dead 
she s gone forever 
and what a waste 
if it could have maybe brought
us together or something 
if you could have just said 
 i m sorry  
or faced up to what happened 
maybe then we could do
something with this 
but you can t take
responsibility for anything 
so now i can t accept   
and i can t forgive because   
because nobody admits
anything they ve done 
what about you  mom 
she didn t wanna go
to the party 
so why was she there 
all right  we re
stopping this right now 
that s it 
i said stop right now 
fine

oh  okay 
all right  come on 
i met a spiritual medium 
they were performing
an open séance 
i know  i know
what you re thinking 
but they asked me to attend 
they were bringing skeptics
in and scientists 
so i went  fully skeptical 
and what i experienced there 
annie  was truly   
open séance   
they brought in the spirit of
a man from the 19th century 
and no  no  not in a kind of
smoke and mirrors way  no 
and the man sitting
next to me
was a completely
cynical neurologist
and he looked permanently
changed by the end of it 
no  i    i    i know
what you re thinking  i do 
but i    i approached
the medium afterwards
and i asked her about my son
and my grandson
and she came to my apartment
and she   
she ended up performing   
well    she conjured
my grandson 
no  no  no  i know  i know
what that smile is  i know 
annie  annie

as the great depression 
for a decade we suffered
through many  many hardships 
in 1929  wall street had been
going so well
that when it finally crashed
