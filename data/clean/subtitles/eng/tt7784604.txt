heres your suit
do you know if your sister
slept in her room last night
i dont know
come on peter get up
oh charlie
for gods sake come on
it was freezing last night
thats how you get pneumonia
thats okay
okay come on
lets go were late
your mothers
in the car already
um
its heartening to see so many
strange new faces here today
um i know my mom
would be very touched
and probably a little
suspicious
um to see this turnout so
my mother was a very secretive
and private woman
she had private rituals
private friends
private anxieties
it honestly feels
like a betrayal
just to be standing here
talking about her
she was a very difficult woman
to read
if you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her
and god forbid
you tried to confront that
but when her life
was unpolluted
she could be
the sweetest warmest
most loving person
in the world
she was also
incredibly stubborn
which maybe explains me
you could always count on her
to always have the answer
and if
she ever was mistaken
and well
that was your opinion
and you were wrong
there arent nuts in that
no
good
does that have nuts cause
we dont have the epipen
i know
hello rexy good dog
shoes off everybody
charlie shoes off
it does feel weird
yeah
should i be sadder
you should be
whatever you are itll come
hey hows it going
mmm just working
taking a break
from avoiding the show
so you still toiling away
at the hospice
yeah between this
and the uh preschool
so whats our deadline now
seven months
six and a half
ooh coming up
any ideas for titles
come in
hey
goodnight kiddo
goodnight
are you uh are you feeling
okay about everything
yeah fine
a little sad
mmm
yeah i get it i know
goodnight
night
love you
whos this
thats grandma
you know
you were her favorite right
even when
you were a little baby
she wouldnt let me feed you
because she needed
to feed you
drove me crazy
she wanted me to be a boy
you know i was a tomboy
when i was growing up
i hated dresses
and dolls and pink
whos gonna take care of me
um excuse me
you dont think
im gonna take care of you
but when you die
well then
dad will take care of you
or peter
you never cried as a baby
you know that
even when you were born
did you feel
like you wanted to cry today
you think it might feel
like a relief
goodnight sweetheart
mom
i just scared myself
in the workshop
with with what
no
are you done
almost
so maybe we finish the toy
after the quiz
what do you think
okay
okay
oh my god what was that
so if we go by the rule
that the hero is undone
by his fatal flaw
what is heracles flaw
arrogance
okay why
because he literally refuses
to look at all the signs
that are literally handed
to him the entire play
okay interesting
so he thinks he has control
but lets all remember
sophocles wrote the oracle
so that it was unconditional
meaning heracles never had
any choice right
so does that make it
more tragic or less tragic
that if he has a choice
less
okay
why
because
care to
weigh in peter
um about which part
i think its more tragic
because if its all
just inevitable
then that means that
the characters had no hope
they never had hope
because theyre all just
like hopeless
theyre all like pawns
in this horrible
hopeless machine
hello
hi
did you go up
in my moms room
no
mmm door was open
hello
sorry i know its irrational
no problem
thank you
hey dad its the cemetery
about what
let me see
hello yes

yes
uh why dont i call you back
yes goodbye
what was it
uh just some billing crap
okay well im uh
im gonna go see a movie
okay
he would say
im a burden im a burden
im a burden
and i would
tell him no no
but yes
he was a burden
now weve set aside
some time for any newcomers
who might like to speak
so anyone
if its your first
or second time with us
the floor is open
yes would you like to
maybe not
okay no pressure
my names annie
hi annie
my mom died a week ago
so im just here
for trying it
i have a lot of resistance
to things like this
but i came to these
a couple years ago
well i was forced to come
and i guess it um
i guess it helped so um
my mom was old and she wasnt
all together there at the end
and we were pretty much
estranged before that
so it really wasnt
a huge blow
but i did love her
and she didnt have
an easy life
she had did which became
extreme at the end
and dementia
and my father died when i was
a baby from starvation
um because he had
psychotic depression
and he starved himself
which im sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds
and then theres my brother
my older brother
had schizophrenia
and when he was 16
he hanged himself
in my mothers bedroom
and of course
the suicide note blamed her
accusing her of putting people
inside him so
that was my moms life
and then she lived
in our house
at the end before hospice
we werent even talking
before that
i mean we were
and then we werent
and then we were
shes completely manipulative
until my husband finally
enforced a nocontact rule
which lasted until i got
pregnant with my daughter
i didnt let her
anywhere near me
when i had my first my son
which is why i gave her
my daughter
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into
and i just
i felt guilty again
i felt guilty again
when she got sick
not that she was really even
my mom at the end
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything
and i just dont want to put
any more stress on my family
im not even really sure
if they could
could give me that support
and i just
i just feel like
i just sometimes
feel like its all ruined
and then i realize
that i am to blame
or not that im to blame
but i am blamed im
and what do you think
you feel blamed for
i dont know
hey whats
going on in town

and then the body

like tar
and her head wasnt there
so i couldnt see her face
but they were gone
and her hands
and her little finger nails
how is your relationship
with your son
peter
hmm
oh god um
okay i sleepwalk
i mean i havent done it
in years but um
a couple years ago
i woke up
and i was standing
next to peter in charlies bed
when they shared a room
and they were
completely covered
in paint thinner
and so was i
from head to toe
and i was standing there
with a box of matches
and an empty can
of paint thinner
and i woke myself up
striking the match
which also woke peter up
and he started to scream
and i immediately put
the match out
like immediately
i mean i was just
as shocked as he was
and it was impossible
to convince them
that it was just sleepwalking
which of course it was but
the timing was awful
peter and i had gotten into
this stupid quarreling phase
just forever arguing
about nothing such
frivolous stuff
and peter always held it
against me
and there was nothing
i can say
and nothing i can do
because it happened
while i was asleep
hey that was quick
did you bike all the way here
um no actually my friend
drove me home
oh uh by the way
peter have you um
have you signed up for that
uh sat prep course
ill do it tomorrow
yeah you know what
you gotta do that
because its coming up
jesus christ annie
youre not planning on letting
him see that are you
who
peter
how do you think hes gonna
feel when he sees that
what its not about him
oh no
no its a neutral view
of the accident
are you uh are you
coming down to dinner
im making dinner
no i made the dinner
i came to get you
come stay whatever you want
i dont really give a shit
this is really good dad
thanks buddy
you okay mom
what
is there something
on your mind
is there something
on your mind
it just seems like there might
be something you wanna say
peter
like what
i mean why would i wanna
say something
so i can watch you
sneer at me
sneer at you
i dont ever sneer at you
oh sweetie
you dont have to
you get your point across
okay so fine then say
what you wanna say then
peter
i dont wanna say anything
ive tried saying things
okay so try again
release yourself
oh release you you mean
yeah fine release me
just say it
just fucking say it
dont you swear at me
you little shit
dont you ever
raise your voice at me
i am your mother
do you understand
all i do is worry and slave
and defend you
and all i get back is that
fucking face on your face
so full of disdain
and resentment
and always so annoyed
well now your sister is dead
and i know you miss her
and i know it was an accident
and i know youre in pain
and i wish i could take that
away for you
i wish i could shield you
from the knowledge
that you did what you did
but your sister is dead
shes gone forever
and what a waste
if it could have maybe brought
us together or something
if you could have just said
im sorry
or faced up to what happened
maybe then we could do
something with this
but you cant take
responsibility for anything
so now i cant accept
and i cant forgive because
because nobody admits
anything theyve done
what about you mom
she didnt wanna go
to the party
so why was she there
all right were
stopping this right now
thats it
i said stop right now
fine
fine

an open séance

they were bringing skeptics

and what i experienced there
annie was truly
open séance
they brought in the spirit of
a man from the 19th century
and no no not in a kind of
smoke and mirrors way no
and the man sitting
next to me
was a completely
cynical neurologist
and he looked permanently
changed by the end of it
no i i i know
what youre thinking i do

the medium afterwards

for a decade we suffered
through many many hardships
in 1929 wall street had been
going so well

bind all men to our will
as we have bound ourselves
