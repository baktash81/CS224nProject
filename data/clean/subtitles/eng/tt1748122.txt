in order to show you how
a big symphony
orchestra is put together
benjamin britten
has written a big piece of music
which is made up
of smaller pieces
that show you all
the separate parts of the orchestra
these smaller pieces
are called variations
which means different ways
of playing the same tune
first of all
he lets us hear the tune or the theme
which is a beautiful melody
by the much older
british composer henry purcell
here is purcells theme
played by the whole orchestra together
orchestra playing
lightning cracking
now mr britten lets you hear
the four different families of the orchestra
playing the same purcell theme
in different ways
first we hear
the woodwind family
the flutes the oboes
the clarinets and the bassoons
instruments playing
children laughing
here comes the brass family
the trumpets the horns
the trombones and the tubas
instruments playing
one to four
water running
boy now mr britten arranges the purcell theme
for the string family
im sick of this rain
boy the violins
the violas the cellos and the double basses
and of course the harp
instruments playing
and finally
the percussion family
all those drums and gongs
and things you hit
instruments playing
after this you will
hear the theme by purcell
played once more in its original
form by all four families together
that is the whole orchestra
orchestra playing

the island of new penzance
16 miles long

oldgrowth pine and maple
crisscrossed by
shallow tidal creeks
chickchaw territory

paved roads but
plane zooming overhead

but instead many
miles of intersecting footpaths and dirt trails
and a ferry that
runs twice daily from stone cove

of black beacon sound
famous for the ferocious
and welldocumented storm
which will
strike from the east on the 5th of september

sam dear scout master ward
i am very sad to inform you

incident involving sams troubles

fair to the others so unfortunately
we cant invite him
back at this time
theres no cause
for alarm sir well find him
were simply notifying you
as a matter of protocol and so on
i understand that
im notifying you of the situation on my end
im confused by
that statement you cant invite him back
im afraid not
hes a good boy hes got a good heart
but its just not fair
to the others you see
hes emotionally disturbed
am i speaking
with sams father
no sir
sams parents passed away
a number of years ago
were mr and
mrs billingsley were foster parents
sams been with
us since last june
excuse me sir
this is scout master ward speaking
are you implying
that sam is an orphan
well its a known fact
of course he is
well why the hell
doesnt it say so in the register
excuse my language
i dont know
what register
we sent him a letter
it should reach you presently
mr billingsley
ive got an escaped khaki scout
we are notifying you
as a matter of protocol
you say you cant
invite him back you say that hes an orphan
i dont understand
how that works
what am i supposed
to do with him
thats up to social services
theyll be in touch with you
theyll look after sam
good luck to you
sighs
you have your orders
use the orienteering
and pathfinding skills
that youve been
practicing all summer
lets find our man
bring him safely back to camp
remember this isnt
just a search party
its a chance to do
some first class scouting
any questions
lazyeye

now lets get started
whos got snoopy
skotak right here
randall give him the scent
i heard he ran away
because his family died
i heard he
never had any family in the first place
thats probably
why hes crazy
ill tell you one thing
if we find him im not going to be the
one who forgot to bring a weapon
scoffs me neither
inaudible
camp ivanhoe thats all the way
across the other side of the island
you really think
a 12yearold boy
could row this far
in a miniature canoe
most likely not
it is possible counselor
i disagree counselor
it would take him three days at least
i dont think so
two days maximum
well im not going to argue about it
be that as it may
will you let me know if you see anything unusual
yup
randall scout masters log
september 2nd
first day of search
party for sam shakusky
morale is extremely low
in part i suppose
because sam is
the least popular scout in the troop
by a significant margin
im confused
and im worried
sighs
please let us
find him tomorrow
please dont let
him fall off a cliff
or drown in the goddamn
lake or something
a terrible day
at camp ivanhoe
breathes deeply
lets hope

of retracing the original
path of the old chickchaw harvest migration
what im getting at is this

across the attic
and settled on a gap in the baseboard
a mouse hole
no bigger than a pocket watch
eric crouched
on his flat feet
and placed his hand in

door opening
door closes
im sorry about this
i didnt know your situation
it wasnt in the register
howd you lose your parents

need to ask about that
i wish we had time
to do an inspection back there on the beach
i would have given
you a commendable
that was one of the
best pitched campsites ive ever seen
honestly
meekly thank you
you dont want to be
a khaki scout anymore
foghorn blows
judy hello becky
judy i have your
persontoperson from new penzance
go ahead new penzance
hello this is
captain sharp
hello captain sharp
this is social services
im calling in
reference to sam shakusky ward of the state
i understand hes
in your custody
thats correct
whats his condition
has he suffered
any injury or
trauma of any kind
hes fine
very good
how do i get to you
the fastest way
would be sea plane
jed can bring you
in with the mail
ill come tomorrow morning
if thats acceptable to you
is someone able to
provide reasonable care
and nourishment for
the boy until that time
uhhuh
is that a yes
uhhuh
very good ill contact you
again before the end of the day
wait a second
yes
social services
captain sharp
whats going to
happen to him
well normally
we try to place him in another foster home
but that options no
longer available to us
in my opinion
due to his case history
which means hell go
to juvenile refuge
wait what does that mean
is that an orphanage
whos speaking
this is scout master
randy ward
right an orphanage
but the first step is
the admissions panel
requires
a psychological evaluation
to determine
whether or not the boy
is a candidate for
institutional treatment
or electroshock therapy
excuse me
shock therapy
why would that
be called for hes not violent
the report describes
an assault with scissors
that was the girl
that was the girl
that did that
well maybe she needs help
too but thats not our job okay
okay
ill be out back
im going to find
a tree to chop down
i do know what
youre feeling suzybean
ive had moments
myself where i say what am i doing here
who made this decision
how could i allow myself
to do something so stupid
and why is it
still happening
we women are
more emotional
i hate you
dont say hate
why not i mean it
you think you mean it
in this moment youre trying to hurt me
exactly
i know what you do
with that sad dumb policeman
hes not dumb
but i guess
he is kind of sad
anyway
we shouldnt discuss that
its not appropriate
for me to even acknowledge
what i already just said
sighs
poor suzy
why is everything
so hard for you
were in love we just want to be
together whats wrong with that
oh my god how are we going to
get these fish hooks out
soft music playing
sam i admit we knew
wed get in trouble that parts true
we knew people would be
worried and we still ran away anyway
but something also happened
which we didnt do on purpose
when we first met each other
something happened to us
thats very eloquent
i cant argue against
anything youre saying
but then again
i dont have to cause youre 12 years old
look lets face it
youre probably a much more
intelligent person than i am
in fact
i guarantee it
but even smart kids
stick their finger
in electrical
sockets sometimes
it takes time to
figure things out
its been proven by history
all mankind makes mistakes
its our job to
try to protect you
from making the
dangerous ones if we can
you want a slug
whats your rush
youve got your whole life
in front of yourself
ahead of you i mean
maybe so
anyway youre a bachelor
so are you
thats true
did you love someone ever
yes i did
what happened
she didnt love me back
ah
im sorry for your loss
anyway thats what
youre supposed to say
scout masters log
september 4th
thunder rumbling
i heard hes going
to reform school
i heard that theyre
going to take out a piece of his brain
send him to
an insane asylum
i like his girl
shes too scruffy for me
supposedly
they got to third base
thats not true
he just felt her up
over shirt or under shirt
damn us
its none of our business
this troop has been
very shabby to field mate sam shakusky
in fact weve been
a bunch of mean jerks
whys he so unpopular
i admit supposedly
hes emotionally disturbed
but hes also
a disadvantaged orphan how would you feel
nickleby
deluca
lazyeye
gadge
hes a fellow khaki scout
and he needs our help
are we man enough
to give that
so part of his brain
doesnt get removed out of him
they were prepared
to die for each other out there
all murmuring indistinctly
okay okay
what do you need
for starters
three yards of chicken wire
some ripped up newspapers
and a bucket of wheat paste
in other words its over
i guess so
for the moment
until further notice
thats right
i understand
i have to do better
for everybody
except me
except you
well i hope you can
i think you will
youre doing
the right thing

a legally binding union
it wont hold up in
the state the county

moral weight
