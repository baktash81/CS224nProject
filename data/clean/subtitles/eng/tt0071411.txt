you can see there is no graveyard 
this was a long time ago 
actually  not such a long time 
nearly three years 
i buried a friend here 
a friend 
huge trees stood here 
a cedar and a fir tree 
remember them 
probably chopped down
when the settlement was built 
could it be those 
dersu 
in the islands  the hunter
roams all day long
but no luck for him
and he curses himseif
what s he going to do
how is he to serve
he cannot be cheerful
so what
he ll try to aim better
so the hunter goes
to warmer waters
where the fish were frolicking
in the beautiful weather
there on the shore
that year   
my assignment was
to go to the shkotovo area   
in the ussurii region   
to make a topographic survey 
sometimes mountains and forests
look cheerful and attractive 
at other times 
they seem sullen and wild 
this isn t just my own feeling 
all the men in the unit
share this feeling 
with god s help 
we will spend the night here 
and tomorrow 
we ll find a more cheerful place 
very well 
we ll halt here for the night 
yes  we ll stay here for the night 
that valley reminded me   
of walpurgis night   
a place where witches
would gather for their sabbath

a falling rock 
is someone coming down
