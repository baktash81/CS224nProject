you can see there is no graveyard
this was a long time ago
actually not such a long time
nearly three years
i buried a friend here
a friend
huge trees stood here
a cedar and a fir tree
remember them
probably chopped down
when the settlement was built
could it be those
dersu
in the islands the hunter
roams all day long
but no luck for him
and he curses himseif
whats he going to do
how is he to serve
he cannot be cheerful
so what
hell try to aim better
so the hunter goes
to warmer waters
where the fish were frolicking
in the beautiful weather
there on the shore
that year
my assignment was
to go to the shkotovo area
in the ussurii region
to make a topographic survey
sometimes mountains and forests
look cheerful and attractive
at other times
they seem sullen and wild
this isnt just my own feeling
all the men in the unit
share this feeling
with gods help
we will spend the night here
and tomorrow
well find a more cheerful place
very well
well halt here for the night
yes well stay here for the night
that valley reminded me
of walpurgis night
a place where witches
would gather for their sabbath
