any places where they might be holed up 
  well  there s
an old fella named jack 
has a place downriver a
bit  but he s not with them 
and there was some kind
of um  army test site
way up the mountain  but that closed down
five  six years ago 
come on  let s go 
go where 
you re taking me up there 
oh  no  i m not 
  you think i m wasting
my time here  don t you

who knows 
i hiked up here once with my ex wife 
they had guard dogs out 
the fence was electrified  the works 
br  barbara randolph 
hmm 
man  that is cold 
  their parents said they
were both excellent swimmers 
  well  wouldn t they be
floating up on top by now 
  it takes a while for the
body to bloat with gas 
nice business you re in 
  you think there s a way to
pull the plug on this thing 
tropical fish 
looks like it s for laboratory rats 
you know  where they
have to make it through
an obstacle course to get a reward 
hmm 
still warm 
come here 
take a look at this 
yuck 
let s get outta here 
this place gives me the creeps 
hey  wait  you   
well  they ve been here all right 
and they never left 
i say we drain the pond 
well  now 
now  wait a minute 
i mean  you can t do that without
getting somebody s permission  you know 
  well  if it still works
it s the quickest way
to know if they re down there or not 
what are you doing 
you 
wait 
are you all right 
he s breathing 
no thanks to you 
well  what was i supposed to do 
he had you by the throat 
i woulda got loose in a second 
oh 
look at this 
you put a dent in it 
could i have a sip of that  please 
it s not water 
what is it 
water s salty 
where does this drain to 
  it was a fish hatchery
before the army took it over 
probably drains
underground into the river 
uh oh 
i think it s a dog 
well  i don t suppose they
would have fit through here 
not in one piece 
you think he s all right up there 
oh  shit 
oh  my god 
  i guess i must have
left the keys in it  huh 
oh   
he s alive 
he s indestructible 
ah 
ah 
  easy 
easy  now  easy 
easy 
razorteeth 
what s razorteeth 
you drained the pond 
yes  we found 
you let them out 
let who out 
  you okay 
  who d we let out 
what s he doing 
you don t know what you ve done 
untie me 
untie me  i ve gotta 
  the question is what
you ve done  mister 
you don t know 
they breed like flies 
there ll be no way to stop them 
would you talk sense  dammit 
now  what about those kids 
i can t tell you 
oh  mother of god  they ll kill us 
they ll kill all of us 
okay  mister  listen 
they re gonna sweat it out of you in town 
they ll kill us 
what have we done 
oh  my god 
he thinks someone s going to kill him 
he s right 
i am  if he steps out of line 
do you have any cigarettes 
no 
quit a year ago 
interfered with my drinking 
hmm 
do you mind if i come in for a minute 
sure 
  so did you start
drinking before or after 
before or after what 
your wife left you 
what the hell kind of question is that 
  look  i m sorry  i mean 
i was just interested 
um   
do you mind if i sit here 
go ahead 
how long were you married 
hmm 
um  10 years 
she was just 17 when we
eloped in her father s car 
man  we thought we had
the world by the balls 
where d you live 
in town 
i worked in a smelting
operation downriver 
then the government closed us down 
said we were killing too many fish 
they gave it to the army
and the army sold it
to some resort outfit 
so you know that
somebody s making a bundle
somewheres along the line 
how do you make a living now 
oh  back pay  unemployment 
i m gonna have to go to
work come september  yeah 
keep my daughter in saddle shoes 
does your daughter live with you 
yeah 
what s wrong 
hmm 
you re so tense 
hmm 
i don t know 
i guess i m not used
to being around people 
well  that s obvious 
i ve been trying to hint
my way under the covers
for five minutes now 
you are really something 
there s no way that we re
gonna get this guy down to town
without your jeep 
we have to do something 
you might have fractured his skull 
we gotta get him to the dam 
there s usually a ranger there 
how do we get there 
on a raft 
come on  stop kidding 
how do we get there 
you ll see 
i read my daughter
huckleberry finn last summer 
we wanted to light out
for the territories 
so we settled on this as a compromise 
looks authentic 
yeah  cut all the logs ourselves 
not a single nail in her 
it s all lashing 
where s your daughter now 
summer camp  other side of the dam 
just how sturdy is this thing 
well  i think it ll hold three people 
though to tell you the
truth  we never tried it 
my daughter s afraid of the river 
  boys are made of greasy
grimy gopher guts  
  mutilated monkey meat  
  little dirty birdie feet  
  sneezed up snail snot
bashed in beetle brains  
  all in a bottle of blood  
  boys are made of greasy
grimy gopher guts  
  mutilated monkey meat  
suzie 
suzie  honey  don t be scared 
you just have to swim out
to the marker and back 
you ve probably swum
twice that far in a pool 
well  if you don t pass your solo swim
you can can t get your water badge 
i don t care 
  well  what is it that
you re afraid of  honey 
things 
you mean like sea monsters 
there s just a few little fish in here 
they eat plants at the
bottom of the river 
they re not at all interested in
little girl s fingers and toes 
dickinson 
over here  mr  dumont 
letter for you  dickinson 
that same boy 
oh  thank you 
  still haven t tackled
your solo swim  grogan 
no  sir 
  oh  she s kind of afraid
of things in the water 
things 
what things 
fish 
people eat fish  grogan 
fish don t eat people 
do you want to be the one to lose
the camp competition for the minnows 
of course you don t 
  oh  she s doing really
well in handicrafts 
handicrafts 
handicrafts don t take any
nerve  any intestinal fortitude 
you know what that means  grogan 
yes  sir 
guts 
right 
is there any mail for her 
mm  nope 
skunked again  grogan 
grogan 
guts 
oh 
come on  let s go 
we ll play some monopoly 
why don t we try it in an
inner tube tomorrow  huh 
come on 
say  brandy 
ever tell you about that other
dog of mine called philip 
well  philip  he was in baltimore with me 
he was a good dog 
he   
he run across the street one day
and he walked right in
front of a trolley car 
trolley car ran over his
tail  it surprised him 
he turned around and the trolley car 
i m telling you a story 
the trolley car ran over his head 
that s what you call losing your head
over a little piece of tail 
hey  pretty funny  huh 
well  what s the matter with you 
you didn t like the story 
you want me to tell you another story 
maybe you didn t get the point 
are you soft in the head 
okay  my friend 
number one  what happened to those kids 
alright  then  try number two 
what were you doing up at the army site 
stop that 
oh  he speaks 
hey 
keep your hand out of the water 
what s wrong with the water 
since you re talking this morning 
buddy  how about a name 
hoak  dr  robert hoak 
what s wrong with the water 
  the water is filled
with carnivorous fish 
piranha 
oh  christ 
in here 
how did they get in 
you let them in when you drained
the pond at the test site 
paul 
piranha are tropical fish 
look  this is cold mountain water 
they wouldn t last in here for a minute 
what about that skeleton 
okay 
well  what would piranha
be doing up in that pond 
huh 
untie me 
hey 
what if i dipped you in the
water a little bit first  doc 
see if you re making the
whole thing up or not  huh 
brandy 
that s jack s dog 
is he always so ferocious 
you know  i don t think i ever heard him
do more than roll over and beg for food 
we better take a look 
easy  boy  easy 
he must have dragged himself this far 
bled to death 
i m sorry 
well 
i ll get a shovel 
he wouldn t want to be buried in town 
even in an inner tube  huh 
uh huh 
it s almost impossible to fall in 
but they can still get ya 
they  huh 
okay 
okay  if that s really
the way you feel about it 
i ll try and help you get out of the race 
but we ve got to come up with an excuse 
do not lie
i got poison ivy 
so does everybody else in the camp 
hey  maybe you could
just be getting your   
no  you re too young for that 
huh 
wait a minute  i have an idea 
come with me 
come here 
come here  sit down here 
let s see what we have in our magic box 
alright  give me your knee 
okay 
get darlene to take your
place in the race  okay 
and if dumont squawks  limp a lot 
and uh  i ll get you a
huge bandage for this 
  feels like this thing s
snagged on the bottom 
i got myself tangled in it  too 
you want me to help 
no  you better stay there 
you might tip the canoe 
  i thought you knew all
about this kinda fishing 
from when you were a boy 
  listen  when i was a
boy we made our own nets
and made  em right 
jesus  feels like
something s snagged in here 
ow 
did you get bit 
ouch 
ow 
dad 
stay back 
dad  dad 
dad 
the government paid you 
of course they paid 
whether it s germ warfare 
the bomb  chemical warfare 
there s plenty of money  special agencies 
oh  no  they pay 
they pay a lot better than
they do in private research 
for raising fish 
no  no 
it s a matter of genetics 
radiation  selective breeding 
they called it operation razorteeth 
what was it all for 
  to destroy the river systems
of the north vietnamese 
our goal was to develop a
strain of this killer fish
that could survive in cold water
and then breed at an accelerated rate 
we had everything 
blank check 
and then the war ended 
you sound disappointed 
they poisoned the water 
after all that work 
they poisoned the water 
but some survived 
we developed a lot of mutants
and a few of them were
able to resist the poison 
they ate their own  their own dead 
and then began to breed
like some wild species 
suddenly there were
hundreds  maybe thousands 
our tax dollars at work  huh 
  well  that s science in the
service of the defense effort 
sure 
spreading strains of bacteria
in the subway system 
  you put them in the river
where they could kill people 
including civilians 
and little kids swimming in the rivers 
i never killed anybody 
if you want to talk about killing 
you talk to your politicians 
the military people 
no  no  i m a scientist 
kids in the water 
what 
the dam 
they let the water through
every couple of days 
you know  to keep the level
steady on the new lake 
the resort s down there  the summer camp 
all those kids 
come on 
hey  stop splashing 
it was pure research 
no scrounging for grant
money  no academic politics 
you don t know what that
means to a scientist 
you fed them 
you kept them alive 
i continued the experiment 
there was so much more i
could do with the species 
so much further i could take them 
you re not holding me responsible 
i think you are 
you pulled the plug and
you re holding me responsible 
incredible 
you re blaming me 
i think if you open your mouth again
i ll stick this pole in it 
  do you think they ve
opened up the dam yet 
i don t know 
we can only hope not 
daddy 
help me 
let s move it 
it s sinking  paul 
the canoe is sinking 
yeah 
daddy 
daddy 
daddy  it s going under 
don t do it 
get outta there 
come on  maggie 
help 
hold it here 
hold it 
come on 
come on  come here 
come on  come on  come on 
get the doctor 
okay  now the doctor 
easy  doc 
here 
here you go 
what do we do 
how do we stop  em 
oh  christ 
campers 
no swinging after lunch 
  so far we know that
they can live in cold water 
they seem to be moving downstream 
we ve gotta find someone who knows
how to deal with these things 
there ll be a phone at the dam 
we can call on ahead 
hey 
what 
i don t know 
it seems like the lashing s working loose 
paul 
there s something under us 
blood 
it s the doc s blood 
it s seeping through 
they re eating away at
the lashing to get to it 
daddy 
let go  son 
but the man 
no  we gotta get rid of him 
no  that s what happened to my daddy 
let go 
they re eating him 
they re eating him 
come here 
just like my daddy 
come here 
you okay  boy 
how about you 
i m alright 
you gotta stay here 
i m gonna try to get to the dam
before they let  em
through with the water 
acres and acres of reclaimed land
nestled in a scenic mountain valley 
site of the newly formed lost river lake 
swimming  sailing  snorkeling 
skin diving  shuffleboard
and for the small fry
there s buck gardner s
aquarena amusement arcade 
so pack up your rvs  your station wagons 
your trailers and cars  and hustle on up
to lost river campsite for
a free introductory weekend 
no charge  no obligation to buy 
yes  friends  you can be part of a modern
ecological miracle 
don t open it 
whatever you do  don t open it 
all right  men  off of your butts 
fall in 
move it 
  you ll forgive
our skepticism  mr  grogan 
but we don t come across
stories like yours everyday 
piranha are warm water fish 
this is hardly the amazon 
but i told you  these are mutations 
they ve already killed
five people that i know of 
science fiction 
you ready with that bait  soldier 
yes  sir 
let her go  son 
actually  a piranha was caught once
in a pond in miami in  72  i believe 
but the fish and game
commission poisoned the water
and that  of course  was that 
that was that  huh 
  i mean  the rumors
persisted  you know  but 
pull it in  son 
sergeant  tell the major
to start the pumps 
  we should be able to
contain them in this area 
piranha travel in
schools and we ve brought
heavy doses of rotenone 235 
came pretty well prepared  didn t you 
won t it ruin this part of the river 
  well  sometimes it s
necessary to destroy
in order to save 
well  what if they realize
they re being slaughtered
and head back upriver 
  we re talking
about fish  mr  grogan  fish 
they don t realize much of anything 
  now  wait a minute  who
are you trying to kid 
you must ve known all along
that these things were here
or you wouldn t have
brought all this stuff 
okay  mr  grogan  here it is 
you and miss mckeown are
the only two civilians
who know about this project 
what the colonel really means
is that he d like you to join us 
become one of our team  as it were 
it figures 
impossible 
look  you re a full colonel  right 
i assume you can read a map 
here 
we are here at the dam  okay 
now  look over here and you ll see
that there s a stream that feeds into it 
okay  we follow the stream back for about
an eighth of a mile and
you see there s a fork 
take this branch  follow it downstream 
and you ll see it empties into the river
on the other side of the dam 
in other words  the piranha have got a way
to get around the obstacle 
  even if there s a
chance that he s right 
don t you think you should do something 
no 
even if a bypass exists 
piranha have neither
the intelligence nor the
motivation to find it 
but you know what hoak was into 
he was breeding them for
endurance and intelligence and 
well  bob was a dreamer 
he  er 
bob 
dr  hoak 
you knew him 
  well  fish genetics
is a very small field 
you were friends 
  but now that
i ve seen what they can do
it s up to me to stop it
and by god i m gonna be   
  let s say were a great
deal more than that 
you re covering up 
is it waxman 
are you afraid of what the
army might do to you if you 
no  i m not afraid 
i m a scientist 
i m head of my department 
it s just that there are priorities and   
some things are more important
than a few people s lives 
that s not how dr  hoak felt 
not at the end 
as i said  he was a dreamer 
  if anything else happens 
it s your responsibility 
  the situation is entirely
under control  grogan 
hold on  now  what is this 
why won t you listen to me 
  would you excuse us
for a moment  please 
as far as you re concerned  mr  grogan 
this project does not exist  understand 
the piranha do not exist 
mm hmm 
and if i make a squawk 
uh  paul 
the interests of national security
permit very extreme measures 
oh  come on  the war is over  dammit 
there ll be other wars  mr  grogan 
i think for your own protection
we d better secure you
a tent for the night 
oh  look who s here 
hey  tom  what s going on  man 
nothing 
psst 
is he still out there 
yep 
then you ll have to distract him 
why 
so i can get away 
  so you can get away 
  shh 
what about me 
alright  suit yourself 
but first you re gonna
have to distract him 
how 
oh  how would i know 
but just get him with his
back to the opening there 
you know  come on to him 
what if he s gay 
then i ll distract him 
let s go 
hi

i know 
no way we can outrun  em in this thing 
well  maybe we can talk to him 
maybe he ll believe us 
piranha  huh 
and where did they come from 
  from an army test
site up on the mountain 
  that s posted up there 
there s no trespassing 
  posted or not  two people
have been killed up there
and more have been killed
all along the river 
look  you ve gotta believe us 
now  wait 
say  aren t you grogan 
yeah  that s right 
uh huh  i remember 
yeah  we had you in on a drunk
and disorderly last month 
i am not drunk  dammit 
you give me a breath
test  whatever you want 
only please  would you listen to me 
  yeah  well  i think i m gonna
take you up on that  buddy 
back at the station 
and while we re there  you can explain
what you re doing this time of night
in an army staff car 
and don t you get any notions  man 
 cause i got my gun in my other hand here 
okay 
okey dokey  let s go 
  yes  we ve got a bit
of a situation up here 
a very delicate situation 
and you can help us control
it by holding them for us 
yes  colonel  yes  yes  i understand 
will do 
  and make sure they
don t try to communicate
with the outside 
we re trying to avoid unnecessary panic 
certainly 
their best interests  i agree 
well  you re welcome  colonel 
uh   
see you in the morning 
well  you best make
yourself comfortable  folks 
you ll be spending the night 
what about a phone call 
you have to give us a phone call 
listen  i don t want to hear it 
i don t want to hear it 
now  i gotta get back on that road now 
so you folks  you just behave yourselves 
now  wait a minute 
you can t just leave 
my daughter s down there 
there are kids down there and
the piranhas are in the river 
please 
the witch and the demons of the forest
scoured every corner of the church 
venom dripping from their fangs 
 where is he   hissed the witch 
the demons peeled their
heavy eyelids back 
there he is 
  no  buck  there s
absolutely no cause for alarm 
it s a complete hoax  believe me 
i just wanted to warn
you in case they were
able to get a call through 
groundless panic of
that kind wouldn t help
our grand opening any 
mm hmm 
well  look  i really
appreciate the warning 
i ll brief my staff 
we ll take care of it

have developed a strain
that can live both in fresh and salt 
you know  like salmon

what the hell are you filming 
try and take some 
  and where do we go
from here  dr  mengers 
  well  i m personally
going to head a full scale
investigation into this incident 
both to discover who is responsible
and to make absolutely certain that
nothing like this could
possibly happen again 
as an expert in tropical species 
what danger is there in the possibility
of the piranha reaching the ocean 
oh  none at all 
most of them will have been destroyed
