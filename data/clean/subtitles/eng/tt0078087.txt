it takes a while for the
body to bloat with gas
nice business youre in
you think theres a way to
pull the plug on this thing
tropical fish
looks like its for laboratory rats
you know where they
have to make it through
an obstacle course to get a reward
hmm
still warm
come here
take a look at this
yuck
lets get outta here
this place gives me the creeps
hey wait you
well theyve been here all right
and they never left
i say we drain the pond

its the quickest way
to know if theyre down there or not
what are you doing
you
wait

where does this drain to
it was a fish hatchery
before the army took it over

underground into the river
uhoh
i think its a dog

eloped in her fathers car
man we thought we had
the world by the balls
whered you live
in town
i worked in a smelting
operation downriver
then the government closed us down
said we were killing too many fish
they gave it to the army
and the army sold it
to some resort outfit
so you know that
somebodys making a bundle
somewheres along the line
how do you make a living now
oh back pay unemployment
im gonna have to go to
work come september yeah
keep my daughter in saddle shoes
does your daughter live with you
yeah
whats wrong
hmm
youre so tense
hmm
i dont know
i guess im not used
to being around people
well thats obvious
ive been trying to hint
my way under the covers
for five minutes now
you are really something
theres no way that were
gonna get this guy down to town
without your jeep
we have to do something
you might have fractured his skull
we gotta get him to the dam
theres usually a ranger there
how do we get there
on a raft
come on stop kidding
how do we get there
youll see
i read my daughter
huckleberry finn last summer
we wanted to light out
for the territories
so we settled on this as a compromise
looks authentic
yeah cut all the logs ourselves
not a single nail in her
its all lashing
wheres your daughter now
summer camp other side of the dam
just how sturdy is this thing
well i think itll hold three people
though to tell you the
truth we never tried it
my daughters afraid of the river
boys are made of greasy
grimy gopher guts
mutilated monkey meat
little dirty birdie feet
sneezed up snail snot
bashedin beetle brains
all in a bottle of blood
boys are made of greasy
grimy gopher guts
mutilated monkey meat
suzie
suzie honey dont be scared
you just have to swim out
to the marker and back
youve probably swum
twice that far in a pool
well if you dont pass your solo swim
you can cant get your water badge
i dont care
well what is it that
youre afraid of honey
things
you mean like sea monsters
theres just a few little fish in here
they eat plants at the
bottom of the river
theyre not at all interested in
little girls fingers and toes
dickinson
over here mr dumont
letter for you dickinson
that same boy
oh thank you
still havent tackled
your solo swim grogan
no sir
oh shes kind of afraid
of things in the water
things
what things
fish
people eat fish grogan
fish dont eat people
do you want to be the one to lose
the camp competition for the minnows
of course you dont
oh shes doing really
well in handicrafts
handicrafts
handicrafts dont take any
nerve any intestinal fortitude
you know what that means grogan
yes sir
guts
right
is there any mail for her
mm nope
skunked again grogan
grogan
guts
oh
come on lets go
well play some monopoly
why dont we try it in an
inner tube tomorrow huh
come on
say brandy
ever tell you about that other
dog of mine called philip
well philip he was in baltimore with me
he was a good dog
he
he run across the street one day
and he walked right in
front of a trolley car
trolley car ran over his
tail it surprised him
he turned around and the trolley car
im telling you a story
the trolley car ran over his head
thats what you call losing your head
over a little piece of tail
hey pretty funny huh
well whats the matter with you
you didnt like the story
you want me to tell you another story
maybe you didnt get the point
are you soft in the head
okay my friend
number one what happened to those kids
alright then try number two
what were you doing up at the army site
stop that
oh he speaks
hey
keep your hand out of the water
whats wrong with the water
since youre talking this morning
buddy how about a name
hoak dr robert hoak
whats wrong with the water
the water is filled
with carnivorous fish
piranha
oh christ
in here
how did they get in
you let them in when you drained
the pond at the test site
paul
piranha are tropical fish
look this is cold mountain water
they wouldnt last in here for a minute
what about that skeleton
okay
well what would piranha
be doing up in that pond
huh
untie me
hey
what if i dipped you in the
water a little bit first doc
see if youre making the
whole thing up or not huh
brandy
thats jacks dog
is he always so ferocious
you know i dont think i ever heard him
do more than roll over and beg for food
we better take a look
easy boy easy
he must have dragged himself this far
bled to death
im sorry
well
ill get a shovel
he wouldnt want to be buried in town
even in an inner tube huh
uhhuh
its almost impossible to fall in
but they can still get ya
they huh
okay
okay if thats really
the way you feel about it
ill try and help you get out of the race
but weve got to come up with an excuse
do not lie
i got poison ivy
so does everybody else in the camp
hey maybe you could
just be getting your
no youre too young for that
huh
wait a minute i have an idea
come with me
come here
come here sit down here
lets see what we have in our magic box
alright give me your knee
okay
get darlene to take your
place in the race okay
and if dumont squawks limp a lot
and uh ill get you a
huge bandage for this
feels like this things
snagged on the bottom
i got myself tangled in it too
you want me to help
no you better stay there
you might tip the canoe
i thought you knew all
about this kinda fishing
from when you were a boy
listen when i was a
boy we made our own nets
and made em right
jesus feels like
somethings snagged in here
ow
did you get bit
ouch
ow
dad
stay back
dad dad
dad
the government paid you
of course they paid
whether its germ warfare
the bomb chemical warfare
theres plenty of money special agencies
oh no they pay
they pay a lot better than
they do in private research
for raising fish
no no
its a matter of genetics
radiation selective breeding
they called it operation razorteeth
what was it all for
to destroy the river systems
of the north vietnamese
our goal was to develop a
strain of this killer fish
that could survive in cold water
and then breed at an accelerated rate
we had everything
blank check
and then the war ended
you sound disappointed
they poisoned the water
after all that work
they poisoned the water
but some survived
we developed a lot of mutants
and a few of them were
able to resist the poison
they ate their own their own dead
and then began to breed
like some wild species
suddenly there were
hundreds maybe thousands
our tax dollars at work huh
well thats science in the
service of the defense effort
sure
spreading strains of bacteria
in the subway system
you put them in the river
where they could kill people
including civilians
and little kids swimming in the rivers
i never killed anybody
if you want to talk about killing
you talk to your politicians
the military people
no no im a scientist
kids in the water
what
the dam
they let the water through
every couple of days
you know to keep the level
steady on the new lake
the resorts down there the summer camp
all those kids
come on
hey stop splashing
it was pure research
no scrounging for grant
money no academic politics
you dont know what that
means to a scientist
you fed them
you kept them alive
i continued the experiment
there was so much more i
could do with the species
so much further i could take them
youre not holding me responsible
i think you are
you pulled the plug and
youre holding me responsible
incredible
youre blaming me
i think if you open your mouth again
ill stick this pole in it
do you think theyve
opened up the dam yet
i dont know
we can only hope not
daddy
help me
lets move it
its sinking paul
the canoe is sinking
yeah
daddy
daddy
daddy its going under
dont do it
get outta there
come on maggie
help
hold it here
hold it
come on
come on come here
come on come on come on
get the doctor
okay now the doctor
easy doc
here
here you go
what do we do
how do we stop em
oh christ
campers
no swinging after lunch
so far we know that
they can live in cold water
they seem to be moving downstream
weve gotta find someone who knows
how to deal with these things
therell be a phone at the dam
we can call on ahead
hey
what
i dont know
it seems like the lashings working loose
paul
theres something under us
blood
its the docs blood
its seeping through
theyre eating away at
the lashing to get to it
daddy
let go son
but the man
no we gotta get rid of him
no thats what happened to my daddy
let go
theyre eating him
theyre eating him
come here
just like my daddy
come here
you okay boy
how about you
im alright
you gotta stay here
im gonna try to get to the dam
before they let em
through with the water
acres and acres of reclaimed land
nestled in a scenic mountain valley
site of the newly formed lost river lake
swimming sailing snorkeling
skin diving shuffleboard
and for the small fry
theres buck gardners
aquarena amusement arcade
so pack up your rvs your station wagons
your trailers and cars and hustle on up
to lost river campsite for
a free introductory weekend
no charge no obligation to buy
yes friends you can be part of a modern
ecological miracle
dont open it
whatever you do dont open it
all right men off of your butts
fall in
move it
youll forgive
our skepticism mr grogan
but we dont come across
stories like yours everyday
piranha are warm water fish
this is hardly the amazon
but i told you these are mutations
theyve already killed
five people that i know of
science fiction
you ready with that bait soldier
yes sir
let her go son
actually a piranha was caught once
in a pond in miami in 72 i believe
but the fish and game
commission poisoned the water
and that of course was that
that was that huh
i mean the rumors
persisted you know but
pull it in son
sergeant tell the major
to start the pumps
we should be able to
contain them in this area
piranha travel in
schools and weve brought
heavy doses of rotenone 235
came pretty well prepared didnt you
wont it ruin this part of the river
well sometimes its
necessary to destroy
in order to save
well what if they realize
theyre being slaughtered
and head back upriver
were talking
about fish mr grogan fish
they dont realize much of anything
now wait a minute who
are you trying to kid
you mustve known all along
that these things were here
or you wouldnt have
brought all this stuff
okay mr grogan here it is
you and miss mckeown are
the only two civilians
who know about this project
what the colonel really means
is that hed like you to join us
become one of our team as it were
it figures
impossible
look youre a full colonel right
i assume you can read a map
here
we are here at the dam okay
now look over here and youll see
that theres a stream that feeds into it
okay we follow the stream back for about
an eighth of a mile and
you see theres a fork
take this branch follow it downstream
and youll see it empties into the river
on the other side of the dam
in other words the piranha have got a way
to get around the obstacle
even if theres a
chance that hes right
dont you think you should do something
no
even if a bypass exists
piranha have neither
the intelligence nor the
motivation to find it
but you know what hoak was into
he was breeding them for
endurance and intelligence and
well bob was a dreamer
he er
bob
dr hoak
you knew him
well fish genetics
is a very small field
you were friends
but now that
ive seen what they can do
its up to me to stop it
and by god im gonna be
lets say were a great
deal more than that
youre covering up
is it waxman
are you afraid of what the
army might do to you if you
no im not afraid
im a scientist
im head of my department
its just that there are priorities and
some things are more important
than a few peoples lives
thats not how dr hoak felt
not at the end
as i said he was a dreamer
if anything else happens
its your responsibility
the situation is entirely
under control grogan
hold on now what is this
why wont you listen to me
would you excuse us
for a moment please
as far as youre concerned mr grogan
this project does not exist understand
the piranha do not exist
mmhmm
and if i make a squawk
uh paul
the interests of national security
permit very extreme measures
oh come on the war is over dammit
therell be other wars mr grogan
i think for your own protection
wed better secure you
a tent for the night
oh look whos here
hey tom whats going on man
nothing
psst
is he still out there
yep
then youll have to distract him
why
so i can get away
so you can get away
shh
what about me
alright suit yourself
but first youre gonna
have to distract him
how
oh how would i know
but just get him with his
back to the opening there
you know come on to him
what if hes gay
then ill distract him
lets go

this is where were going to
separate the tortoises from the hares
the wheat from the chaff and
the sinkers from the swimmers
saltwater
what
i just remembered it was saltwater
what was
in the pond at the test site
i thought it was strange at the time
and then i forgot about it
so
well piranha are freshwater fish
that means that hoak must
have developed a strain
that can live both in fresh and salt
you know like salmon
thats why theyre headed downstream
and if they get to the ocean
therell be no way to contain em
theyll be able to swim up
every river system in the country
and what are you doing here young lady

what danger is there in the possibility
of the piranha reaching the ocean
oh none at all
most of them will have been destroyed
