you know you are   
as he is 
i m talking about slitherpoole 
and  marc  can i just give
a big shout out to pop pop
for buying me the franchise 
we did it  anything is possible 
thank you  pop pop 
so thank you again  stoker 
much love  t out 
come on  sig  time for the t
train to leave the station 
i m sorry  winnie 
i gotta go where he goes 
the sports world
is absolutely abuzz
with tentacular s shocking
departure from stoker last night 
why did i buy
this stupid sign 
  you gotta be kidding 
  what do we do 
can you believe it 
i can t 
mom 
are we gonna be okay 
i don t know  hon 
but we ve been through worse 
 do you want neon    sure   i said 
 money s no object  
have you seen
my hair salon 
your hair salon 
what about that tattoo i just got on my   
all right everybody  now  settle down 
just settle down 
look 
i know you re all worried 
after all  each of us owns
a piece of stoker stadium 
but what
you don t realize is
that things are actually much 
much worse than you know 
hang on  what 
uh  our councilwoman over here
can explain everything to you 
probably her fault
anyway 
wow  thank you so much 
mr  mayor 
pretty sure
it s your fault  though 
okay  let me
make it simple 
very simple 
the stadium costs
lots of money  okay 
no monster means
no money 
no money means
no stadium 
which is bad for stoker 
oh  my gosh  remember when
pittsmore lost lebrontosaurus 
not pittsmore 
that s right 
all they have left
is that illegal
monster wrestling club
in that abandoned
bobblehead factory 
ooh  scary lightning 
okay  hold on 
everybody 
i m here to tell you
that there is a solution 
the owner of
the slitherpoole franchise
has offered us a lot of money
to buy the stadium 
  yes 
  we re saved 
yes  yes  that is great 
he s gonna blow up the stadium
and turn it into a parking lot 
  what 
  what 
  a parking lot 
  yes 
with shuttle service
to slitherpoole 
you can t do that to the jimbo
coyle stadium  that s    no 
sorry  the whole town will go
bankrupt unless we sell to jimothy 
but without monster wrestling 
we re not stoker 
  we ll have nothing 
  we ll have a parking lot 
you can t just tear down everything
my dad and rayburn built here 
they never quit 
you know what
my dad always said 
 when you get knocked down 
you get back up  
getting back up isn t gonna
pay my bills  winnie 
  i invested everything in him 
  what am i supposed to do 
winnie  look  i m sorry 
the loans on the stadium
are due in 90 days 
and if you think we can replace a
champion like tentacular before then 
that    that s just   
it s crazy 
  get real 
  we re doomed 
and in the blue corner 
the hometown hero 
rayburn 
hey  win 
what do you think 
it s gonna be tough  but rayburn
has one thing gargantuan doesn t 
oh  what s that 
you  dad 
better watch out  siggy 
looks like jimbo s got himself
a new assistant coach 
you re a riot  rayburn 
now can we please focus on the match 
okay  rayburn 
you know what to do 
everything we need to win
is in here 
in here  and in here 
now  go make
stoker proud 
and here we go 
take him down 
and there it is 
the reverse sto
and another championship for
rayburn  the greatest of all time 
he did it

that money 
we re gonna have to try a very
radical new strategy here 
ready for it  try to win 
okay  big shot  how 
okay 
uh  so  he s strong 
  yeah  i got that 
  he s really freakishly strong 
but you know what that means 
no stamina 
  so here s what you re gonna do  run away 
  uh huh 
if he does catch you  let him hit you 
then start running again 
that s your big plan 
yep  and then when he s all punched
out  we make our move 
so run away
and then let him hit me 
and if you get knocked down 
you re gonna get back up 
staying down is much easier 
  get back up 
  okay 
oh  no 
okay  so now what 
just keep going in a circle
and hope
he runs out of steam 
yes  that s it  come on 
come on  come on  come on 
keep going  you re doing it 
oh  i hope this works 
i thought you said
he had no stamina 
it s a theory 
whoo hoo 
ha  ha  see you later  sucker 
oh  that smarts 
keep it up 
he s slowing down 
is he   cause it feels like
he s speeding up 
  look out 
  whoa 
no  no  no  no  no  no 
does he just not get hurt 
is that his deal 
oh 
  yes 
  yeah 
get up  he s coming 
uh oh 
now  pin him 
i am less exhausted
than you 
he s out 
and the winner is   
steve the stupendous 
yes  yes  all right 
way to go  ray    i mean  steve 
oh  yeah 
uh huh  uh huh 
you did it  you won 
  this is winning 
  yeah  how does it feel 
it feels    not bad 
i feel not bad 
and now for my favorite
segment   worst match of the week  
easy choice this week  marc 
take a look 
oh  man  it s really
an insult to the sport 
and i don t just mean
this sport  i mean any sport 
to competitiveness  for crying out loud 
this is just awful 
okay  calm down there  marc 
and now we re gonna go
from the bottom of the league
to the very tippy  tippy top 
slitherpoole 
ooh  what a brutal takedown 
and to everybody who wondered
how tentacular would handle the
big city pressure  the answer s simple 
he s never wrestled better 
who is the goat  g o a t 
me  the greatest of all time 
why did he leave us 
i miss him 
he s so big 
fast  strong 
ha  whatever the opposite is of
that monster winnie dragged here 
she just never did know
when to quit 
why 
ugh 
 worst match of the week  
i know  my first win 
and it was on tv 
  how awesome 
  no 
no  it s not awesome  steve 
no one s ever gonna fight us in stoker 
we re a joke 
and just for the tiniest moment there 
i was feeling okay about myself 
yeah  well  that s over now 
look  you still need a pile of cash 
and i need to stop jimothy from
turning this into a parking lot 
we need to get serious 
i hate getting serious 
it s time to do it by the book 
my dad s playbook 
this is the key that ll turn you
from a zero into a hero 
oh   zero   is it 
that s motivating 
chapter one  basic fitness 
oh  i m tired already 
yeah  let s do this

 daddy issues  
oh  right  sorry

i m just having some fun 
monster wrestling
isn t about fun 
oh  okay   jimbo  
whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
you don t try 
i try not to be a stick in the mud 
maybe you ought to try that too 
you re uncoachable 
and you re not good
at coaching 
i m sorry  but this is why i
left stoker in the first place 
everyone wants me to be my dad 
and i m not 
okay  maybe you re right 
maybe i m going about this
all wrong 
let s just start over 
what gets you out of bed in the morning 
what gets your heart racing  your
blood pumping  what do you love to do 
uh    nothing 
come on 
there must be something 
no  i m sorry  i really 
literally mean i like to do nothing 
i m gonna need
more than that 
oh  uh  sleeping 
  really 
  yeah  oh  yeah  really  i m real good at it 
  or sitting is another one  i like sitting 
  not helping 
did i mention sitting 
i feel like i did  oh  eating 
is there anything else 
oh  there s also salsa  but  uh 
yeah  that s it  that s probably it 
like  with chips 
i said it very clear 
i said salsa 
like salsa  salsa 
i don t like dancing 
is that so 
okay  yes 
there s nothing on this planet
i love more than dancing 
i mean  you know  i prefer
traditional cuban salsa 
but this up tempo stuff s
pretty cool too 
ha  you re a surprisingly
good dancer 
i ran with a pretty fast crowd in
cuba when my dad wrestled down there 
wrestling is 80  footwork 
yeah  i learned the tango in
argentina  the flamenco in spain 
well  anyway  that was a different life 
how about this 
  hold on 
  not bad for 22 tons 
whoa 
  left foot 
  left foot 
  right foot 
  right foot 
  left 
  and big finish 
oh  yeah 
you re doing great 
all right  where is he 
i can t even see him 
this guy is crazy fast 
you ve gotta slow him down 
execute plan tango 
yes  yes  keep it up 
it s working 
yes  now 
steve won 
yeah  oh 
this is embarrassing nonsense
we re witnessing right now 
what are you doing 
i m learning to dance

no  no  no  no 
you are not dancing 
see  look 
see what i m doing 
  i m trying

come on  push it  steve 
pain is weakness leaving the body 
i m awake  whoa 
yes 
  yes 
  steve  whoo hoo  up top 
now you re dancing 
okay  so  there s no spots left
in the saturday super smashdown 
but some lizard dude in the eastern
league is shedding his skin right now 
ew  gross 
ugh  i know 
so  they ll take us
as a replacement 
the only catch is 
this guy you re gonna wrestle 
he is really big 
like  i mean  huge 
think of the biggest thing
you ve ever seen  enormous 
oh  come on 
  it s in my mouth 
  ugh 
the only way we re gonna beat him
is by getting him on his back 
  so how do we do that 
  wait for it 
we re gonna need some help 
long time no see  steve 
what 
okay  get ready 
nobody puts ray ray
in a corner 
now  lift 
  come on 
  lift me 
do it again  again 
that s it  you got it 
whee 
and now  do the lift 
you did it  you won 
oh  come on  mac 
this ain t monster wrestling 
it s an affront to the sport 
and you know it 
we all should be shocked
and appalled 
but somehow they ve won
three in a row 
and the way he combines
traditional cuban salsa
with a hint of modern swing
and then finishes
with a lovely technical lift 
that is a high degree
of difficulty right there 
your knowledge of dance moves
is mystifying to me 
still waters run deep  marc 
still waters run deep 
right  mac  joining us now
from their latest match
is winnie coyle

you have enough money
to pay lady mayhen now 
you don t need me 
just leave me alone 
even if i wanted to   
   i m pretty sure
i live here now 
i thought i was
saving my dad s legacy 
and instead  i ruined it 
i ve made
the coyle name a joke 
well  the good news is 
you can always change
your name and run away 
that worked for you  steve 
but if i m not winnie coyle 
i m nothing 
come on  winnie 
what a sad end
to the legacy of stoker 
i told you  mac  i told you 
the whole thing was a joke
and a disgrace to the sport 
to the coyle name 
i ll tell you that too 
and i for one
am glad it s over 
well  it was fun
while it lasted 
and i still think
steve has a bright
dancing future ahead of him

or pockets or   
look 
i need my coach back 
don t you get it 
we re a total joke 
we don t belong in the ring 
hey  you know that feeling
that you re feeling right now 
that s how i felt
my whole life 
i spent so much time
running away
from what i thought
i should be
or what people
expected me to be
that i never found out
what i could be 
and now    now i have 
and i know that
i m never gonna be the goat
or win the big belt 
and that is just fine 
but i am not going back
to being a loser

super excited
for what they are calling
the match of the century 
  and though rayburn jr

but for now it s goodbye
steve the stupendous 
and hello  rayburn jr  
okay  the town
has come together and built
this spectacular anti tentacular
agility and evasion training device 
otherwise known as
the gauntlet of doom 
that s not a fun name 
nothing we ve done comes close
to going three rounds with tentacular 
but we might just have a shot
if you can survive the gauntlet
and reach my dad s statue 
uh oh 
all right  twinkle toes 
put on your red shoes 
let s dance 
  ooh 
  let s do it again 
the most important
thing you gotta do
is neutralize tentacular s
biggest threat 
  his right hook 
  no  it s in his name 
oh  his tentacles 
i was gonna say his tentacles 
we re gonna use every trick
you learned in the underground 
every step you learned on your global
dance journey that you do not talk about 
oh  come on 
every fake out and foxtrot 
singin  in the rain 
the worm 
pop and lock 
they say offense
is the best defense 
no  defense
is the best defense 
it doesn t have to look pretty 
it just has to get us through the third 
come on  that was pretty 
to survival 
ah ah  you re not done yet 
am i ready now 
mm hmm 
you re ready  rayburn 
oh  yeah  i m stoked
to be back in stoker 
we all are 
whoo 
tonight is going to
go down in history
as the greatest match ever
or the shortest 
most painful embarrassment
to ever happen in professional
monster wrestling 
i m praying it s a great match 
 cause i got something to tell you 
i am not interested
in going home tonight 
it sounds like
there s a story there 
but i m gonna have to
cut you off  marc 
because i am just hearing
we re moments away
from the competitors
entering the ring 
you ready  champ 
it s show time 
well  that ruined
my cool entrance 
ladies and gentlemen 
world monster wrestling
presents a special event 
one stadium 
one last chance 
two monsters 
the smackdown
to save the stadium 
  let him win 
  in this corner 
weighing in at 22 tons 
standing 43 feet tall 
from stoker 
rayburn jr  
oh  yeah 
  rayburn jr  
  you got this  winnie 
hey  everybody 
i know her 
she eats in my diner 
look at
the confidence  marc 
somebody s gotta
say this about rayburn jr 
we know he s audacious  he s courageous 
but three rounds with tentacular 
what is he thinking 
he might be losing his monster mind 
  i just don t know 
  there is so much riding on him tonight 
let s not forget to mention
that in his corner
is the young rookie coach
winnie coyle 
that s right  daughter of the
legendary coach jimbo coyle 
winnie  no matter
what happens tonight 
your father would be
so proud of you 
thanks  mom 
and now 
in his return to stoker 
the undefeated reigning
holder of the big belt 
tentacular 
what s going on  stoker 
oh  you miss this 
forget about it 
 cause you ain t ever seeing
one of these again 
ray  you okay 
rayburn 
are you with me 
i am literally terrified 
i don t think i can do this 
i can t be him 
no  you can t 
but we don t have to
be our dads 
we just have to be ourselves 
you showed me that 
they wrote their stories 
and we re writing ours right now 
and  yeah  maybe theirs was all
dramatic and super serious 
and maybe ours is more like
a slapstick comedy 
oh  i love those 
me too 
especially ones about friends 
so  are you ready to go out there
and look ridiculous tonight 
  yes 
  how ridiculous 
very  very ridiculous 
  and do we care 
  we don t care 
uh  i can t hear you 
we do not care 
now  buck up 
put your game face on 
because it s time
to wrestle 
and dance  both 
whoa  time out 
was that a coach speech 
man 
i feel so inspired 
  you do 
  yeah 
you should ve done that
before every match 
all right  wrestlers 
to the center of the ring 
okay  let s go make it
through the third 
and if you live 
let s get froyo afterwards 
oh  i love froyo

that was a good shot 
kind of lucky  but i m all right 
what 
what are you waiting for 
go get him 
oh  come on 
really  really 
rayburn isn t even
trying to wrestle 
he thinks he s gonna dance
his way through this 
it would appear that way  marc 
and i gotta say it s working 
watch his hands 
not his shimmering salsa feet 
  yes  that s it 
  really  we came out here for this 
look at that 
tentacular can t get near him 
look out 
missed again 
here we go 
oh  there it is 
  watch the tentacles 
  what 
oh  and he gets away 
  oh  right into the post 
  yes 
i can t believe
what i m seeing 
rayburn hasn t landed a single
blow  and he s still in the match 
take that  traitor 
tonight s special 
fried calamari 
tentacular is seething mad 
and i don t blame him one bit 
i mean  can we have
our money back 
yeah  i really hate to sit here and say
that you re right about anything  marc 
but i m not even sure we can call this
a monster wrestling match right now 
we re doing this 
we re actually doing this 
hey  stay focused 
we re not ordering froyo yet 
okay  champ  he thinks he s
got us with his sweet moves 
but he don t know
we got a few moves of our own 
why don t we ask him
to dance 
don t mind if i do 
come on  rayburn 
dance around him  not with him 
looks like siggy s
done his homework 
is that a paso doble
step routine 
they re both dancing now 
good grief 
i can t take this 
i can t take this 
look at tentacular go 
attaboy 
what a sweet move

embarrassment to your dad s name

tentacular didn t want
that round to end 
i can t see this lasting
much longer  mac 
all he has to do
is hold on for this
one last round 
and he saves the stadium 
not happening  mac 
tentacular s about to destroy rayburn jr 
you can book that 
winnie  listen to me 
this ain t good 
there s no stopping t when
he smells blood in the water

i am not sure
that s a good idea 
are you serious right now 
i cannot believe this 
tell me when it s over  marc 
i can t watch 
do it for stoker 
then combine the renegade
with the roundhouse tail whip 
and if he anticipates
and gets a hold of you 
hit him as hard as you can
right in the tentacles 
just to be clear 
you are saying  tentacles   right 
yeah  tentacles  okay

a match than we were expecting

a whole new style of wrestling 
and tentacular
can t deal with it 
he looks completely lost

  he s making a joke out of us 
  he switches it up every time 
  t  look out 
rayburn 
out of nowhere 
he s on his heels 
keep it up 
oh  this is special 
i ve never seen a match like this before 
slams him down  oh  but rayburn
comes back with the clothesline 
i m not saying i was wrong

correct about these kids
