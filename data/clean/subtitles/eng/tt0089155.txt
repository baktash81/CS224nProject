if you haven t guessed  there s been
a lot of drug traffic on the beach 
i m not talking about no doze

a lot of it 
i ve been trying to find out
who s behind it 
it hasn t been easy 
i don t shower much 
excuse me  i have something
i d like to discuss with you

it just eats you up
bit by bit 
you don t look sick 
i don t feel sick  not yet 
i ll get bad
in a month 
after that  i d rather
not be around for it 
why not try suicide 
i ve thought about it 
my company s taken out
a large life insurance policy on me 
suicide would nullify it 
but murder does not 
  why me 
  you re a drifter 
a  uh    pardon the expression   
a junkie 
nobody would notice
if you disappeared 
i ve been watching you
for a couple of weeks 
maybe i m
just on vacation 
not with the scum
you hang out with 
no  i ve watched   
and i ve thought 
i s an elegant plan 
i ve even figured out
your escape 
swell 
has it ever occurred to you
i might not want to murder you 
i ve got  50 000
says you will 
50 000 
and a guarantee you
won t get caught 
i m still here 
i want it done thursday

  these will be open 
  wouldn t they normally be locked 
sometimes  the staff
usually forgets 
i have the same trouble
with my help 
i ll be here
waiting for you 
the safe will be open 
there will be
 50 000 in it 
you ll be wearing rubber gloves

a lease with an option to buy 
now in this drawer   
ah 
a 357 magnum 
my 357  you use it 
no one can trace it to you 
the room will be
in disarray 
like a burglary attempt 
you come in and catch me
stealing your ties and money 
we scuffle  the gun
gets loose and i shoot you 
precisely 
  are you a good shot 
  yeah  i m all right 
get me on the first shot 
if you can 
  do you have a passport

alan and i were recently
speaking of dying 
he told me boyd aviation took out
a large insurance policy on him

we don t need to 
we don t want
to do that 
my kidneys feel better

how can the s e c 
make such an accusation 
you know that

will be the scapegoats 
unbelievable 
this is unbelievable 
they want to know
why he s in utah 
jesus h  christ

first of all   
alan stanwyk does not own
one single share of stock 
the  3 million

of your d c  boys   
want to challenge that

the father of

our very own
and beloved leader   
a man who needs
no introduction 
thank you very much  sammy 
i couldn t wait 
that was a very nice introduction 
and i am   
very thrilled
and proud to be here 
i s been a wonderful ceremony
here on behalf of our own fred   
the dorf dorfman 
  who is he 
  fred was darn near death recently 
he wasn t ashamed to admit to me
that he had syphilis 
thank god he stopped it
in its tracks 
it takes a lot for a man   
to admit where he got it from
and how he got it 
look at him today 
fred  you look just wonderful 
the nose looks normal again 
the face has come back into shape 
i s not drooling anymore 
and hats off to marge  his wife 
because that whole experience   
the three weeks that she stayed
at trembling hills has paid off 
no more alcohol
or sedatives in her life 
there are many other things
i wanna tell you about fred   
things that maybe many of you
already know 
sammy  you re not going
to sing for us  are you 
did you know that fred
spent much of his life   
honoring a profession that has gone
largely unsung around here 
some of them are here tonight 
the profession is law enforcement 
i know fred feels that too often
our feelings are locked in   
and we feel restrained
and perhaps even embarrassed   
to reach out and touch
an officer of the law 
after all  they are people 
aren t they 
stand up  pat them on the back 
reach out 
shake hands with any one
of these men in blue 
hug a cop 
yeah  go ahead  i said it 
yeah 
tha s a wonderful feeling 
i m so proud tonight 
  oh  say can you see  
  by the dawn s
early light  
  what so proudly we hail  
  at the twiligh s
last gleaming   
hip  hip  hooray 
hooray

i don t like basketball

you little vixen 
 fletch  the coroner
had certified stanwyk dead   
or extremely sleepy 
and chief karlin was facing
20 years in the fun house

to accompany gail to rio   
and personally assist her
in her grief therapy 
on the beach  i explained basketball
to her  but she didn t grasp it 
  fletch 
  call me erwin 
 gail laughs 
why do they bounce
the ball the whole time 
doesn t it seem
a little childish 
well  it may seem that 
but tha s called dribbling 
  dribbling 
  if they stop bouncing the ball   
they get called for traveling 
traveling  aha 
tha s what they call it
when you don t bounce the ball 
when it came to basketball 
gail was a loss 
but we had our own version
of one on one   
and she thought i was the bravest man
in the world  which i am
