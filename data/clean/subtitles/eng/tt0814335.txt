detective tylar  one female
in her late thirties
and three minors 
multiple stab wounds
and blunt force trauma 
captain mackie  what about
the ex husband 
court said the wife
had a restraining order
against him 
dylan bennet 
he spent the night with
a bottle of jack daniel s 
lt was his
first christmas
without his family 
mackie  all the more reason 
tylar  well
you didn t se e him
when he id ed his family 
looked like he d been
hit by a freight train 
detective shay 
seeing his kids like that 
all the blood 
yeah  it was definitely
a nightmare for him 
tylar  if this guy did it 
he gets my vote for
a goddamn academy award 
let s say the stepfather 
this grady edwards did it 
what do we got on him 
nothing 
said he was from kansas 
shay  except we can t find
a match in any database 
and he stopped the newspaper
to have time to disappear 
and we think he might
have done this before 
three years ago
in new jersey 
a wife and three kids 
gunshot wounds to
the back of the head 
the stepfather disappeared 
lived in a rented room
where he met the victims 
both rooms were owned
by older women 
one of the women
who lives in new jersey said 
  he s a wondeful man 
always paid his rent
on time and in cash   
so  of course 
she never asked him
for any identification 
shay  no  he s smart 
the toyota land cruiser
that we found abandoned 
paid for in cash 
no driver s license
required for registration 
tylar  no credit cards 
no anything  which means   
mackie  no photo id required 
shay  always a divorced
or widowed situation 
tylar  l m telling you 
this guy s a monster 
even if this is your guy 
it s been six months 
he could be anywhere by now

 david sharpening pencil 
 doorbell chimes 
susan s not here 
how about the kids 
beth s at a friend s 
sean and michael are
upstairs playing video games 
look  uh   
l m sorry about
the other night 
l made an ass out of myself 
it s just when susan
and l fight   
l was headed to the airport 
l wanted to say goodbye
to the kids and   
well  l d like to
apologize to you
for being a jerk 
apology accepted 
come on in and say goodbye 
hey  michael tells
me you used to swim
for the ducks 
a long time ago 
yeah  what year

really 
l went to u of o myself 
 telephone rings 
l got to grab that 
excuse me 
sure  sure 
hello 
hey 
jay had left a message
on my cell phone
saying he was gonna
stop by there to say
goodbye to the kids 
did he come yet 
no  not yet 
okay  well  if he does 
will you just stay
out of the way 
all right 
l ll see you later then 
hey  you want to
hear something funny 
l called the alumni office
and they told me
they only had four guys
named david harris
graduate in
the last 30 years 
and two of them are dead
and one graduated in  87 
and the other one was that
all american running back 
you remember him 
of course  he s a little
darker than you are 
wouldn t you say 
so  uh   
lt s just   
it seems like you
might have lied to michael
about college and swimming 
and now
it s got me wondering
just  you know 
what else you
might ve lied about 
hey  look  l told michael
that l would do
some checking on you
and  to be honest 
l d like some answers 
hey  you hear me 
yep 
 glass shatters 
 pauses game 
what 
l heard something 
what was it 
l don t know 
it s nothing 
 music from game
resumes playing 
l don t understand 
l m kind of confused 
because   
about 
well  the feedback
from the buyers was great 
he just felt that
it wasn t what he
thought it was gonna be 
you re okay with
him on the road 
he s gonna try to find
something where he doesn t
have to travel that much 
and l just want
him to be happy 
if he s happy  l m happy 
there you go 
l just want to get his bags 
 engine starts 
pop the trunk 
you got it 
 dialing 
 muffled grunting 
 cell phone rings 
 on volcemail 
this is jay harding 
leave a message 
hey  dad  it s me 
where are you 
call me  bye 
 straining efforts 
david 
yeah  what do you
need  michael 
nothing 
you know when you asked me
at michael s party
if l thought you were
rushing into things 
l m thinking now
that maybe you are 
l mean  how much do you
really know about david 
the same day that l
ask him for details
about his past 
he just up and quits 
you don t find that strange 
no  l don t 
you know what l want to do 
l want to go to vegas
and have one of those
10 minute weddings 
nice 
david wants to have
a church wedding 
that s great  what church 
l mean  do you even
know what religion he is 
l don t care what
goddamn religion he is 
okay  you re starting
to sound just like jay 
he s accused me of
not knowing anything
about david 
you know what l do know 
david has been good to me 
he s good to the kids 
they love him 
he s made my life
worth living again 
l mean  l   
for the first time
in a long time 
l m looking forward
to the future with a smile 
l just wish everybody
would be happy for me 
ls that too much to ask 
no  it s not 
personally  l m with you 
hey  l d have my teeth
cleaned in vegas if l could 
right 
go  go  go 
watch it  wow 
l just missed that car 
hey  guys 
david  hey 
hey  mom 
how d it go with
jackie and leah 
we decided we
should go to vegas 
l ll be right back 
where s michael 
he s in his room 
l think he s a little upset
that his father never showed 
that is so typical of jay 
honey 
yeah 
l have a confession to make 
l accidentally
broke the crystal vase
that was in the living room 
 laughs in relief 
that s okay 
lt was a wedding
gift from jay s sister 
l never liked it anyway 
you didn t 
mmm mmm 
or her 
then l don t feel so bad 
you don t think
it s a little weird
that l ask for some
background information 
and suddenly 
he doesn t want to sell
real estate anymore 
not necessarily 
l like david 
he s a gentleman 
he always picks up the tab 
jay was so cheap 
do you know what l
do think is weird  though 
he always pays in cash 
who doesn t
want the miles 
you know  l never thought
l would ever say this 
but l think l m
gonna give jay a call 
l mean  if he s not
buying this either 
then maybe it s
worth checking into 
hey  he didn t show up 
no 
l m so sorry 
that s okay 
no  it s not okay 
he s never been
there for you like
a father should be 
and part of that s my fault
because l never
should have allowed it
to go on as long as it did 
that s why david s
so important to me 
because he cares
about you kids 
he wants you to be here
and be part of your lives 
he s so perfect  isn t he 
take those off 
l thought you d be
able to see how happy
david makes me 
he is part of
this family now 
l want him in my
life and our lives
and you need to
understand that 
do you understand that 
michael 
yeah  l understand  okay 
okay 
 sighs frustratedly 
 david typing on cell phone 
david  are you down   
l m just putting
some things away 
l ll be right up 
okay 
 sighs 
 vibrating 
sorry l didn t make it 
definitely next time

your soon to be stepfather

he seems to be
who he says he is 
lt was good seeing you

 doorbell chimes 
hey 
college applications 
my adviser said we

okay 
come on 
l m coming 
lt all sounds
circumstantial
at best to me 
l know  l know it does 
l know it does 
but l m telling you 
it s really starting
to give me the creeps 
just think about it  please 
one day 
this woman tells my mom
about this show that she saw 
and the next  she s dead 
she s dead now 
lt was an accident 
you said so yourself 
so how does he know that
she broke her neck
falling down the stairs 
how does he know that 
the mailman never
said anything about that 
l heard the whole
conversation  l swear 
l wish l could tell
my mom about this 
lf you bring
this up to your mom 
she s gonna send you back 
 the funeral playing 
  l m coming up only
to show you wrong
hey  you got to admit 
the comment at
the dinner table
about the woman
who killed her kids
was kind of weird 
come on  it was
weird to say the least 
and then his daughter 
how do you mix up
your daughter s
name like that 
he didn t 
her name was lisa michelle 
that s what you said he said 
l said he said that 
but you weren t there 
right 
you didn t see his face 
it s in his face 
let me get this straight 
all right 
the neighborhood weirdo   
yeah 
   sees a show
about a man who
kills his family
and then you think
that david mixed up
the name of his daughter 
so therefore
he s the guy that
killed his family 
l don t know 
yeah  that all
adds up to me 
  really too late to call
look  you said
your dad checked
up on him  right 
and everything was cool 
yeah 
okay  then  right 
lt s fine  relax 
  to know me as hardly golden
are we gonna finish these

you know  you re just
a little freaked out
that your mom s
marrying a stranger 
l was the same way
when my mom was
gonna marry jack 
you know  and then
he turned out to be cool 
lf you re gonna
obsess about something 
you should obsess
about something that
really matters 
like what 
like me 
l don t want to have
another long distance
relationship with you 
 whispers  so keep
your eye on the ball 
  l m coming up only

l don t know 
l ll probably text

beth  david 
beth  david  you okay

michael  shut up 
l m being serious 
l know  l know 
you do 
yeah  l mean 
l ve been thinking about
what you said 
about all of it  really 
and l ve decided that   
that you re right 
l mean  maybe  maybe 
l am obsessing 
you think 
l mean  my dad said
he was all right  so   
l guess the rest of it
is just me freaking out 
l think you should
come by tomorrow
and we ll get these
college applications finished 
no more obsessing

okay  good night 
okay  night 
 knocking on door 
yeah  come in 
hey  you got a sec 
sure  what s up 
how you doing 
uh  fine 
maybe l m wrong 
but for a while there 
l thought we were
off to a good start 
and now l m getting the
feeling that somehow we re
not on the same page 
l know it can t
happen overnight  michael 
but for the sake
of the family 
you gotta understand
that things are going
to change around here 
lt s not gonna
be like it was 
but hopefully better 
yeah  l do  l know 
good 
l just want you to
always be up front with me 
no lies 
no sneaking around 
your mom wouldn t like that 
and you need to
win back her trust 
l don t want to see you
have to go back to
that school again 
 floor creaks 
you swore on your life 
just look at the
police sketches 
please 
that s all l m asking 
there is a resemblance 
you got to admit 
it kind of looks like him 
you know who this
actually looks like 
it looks like mr  rockwell 
our biology teacher
from freshman year 
no  you hardly looked at it 
all right 
it could be anybody 
look  this is grady edwards 
the police couldn t match
his id 
they couldn t
trace any fingerprints 
and there are similarities 
he said he was in sales 
he said he traveled a lot 
they can never find
any pictures of him either 
so l asked beth
this morning
if she could find any
pictures of him in the house 
any pictures of david 
there aren t any because
he doesn t like having
his picture taken  apparently 
so what 
neither do l 
but l swear
l didn t kill that woman
and her kids  okay 
lt doesn t prove anything 
the website was in
the browser history 
he was checking it out 
so what if he was 
or maybe it was your mom 
or maybe they both
were because they were
curious about what
mrs  cutter said 
l mean  that s what
made you check it out 
all right 
lt s fine 
just forget about it 
are we gonna
finish these  michael 
hold on one second 
what is it 
you just don t want to go
to college with me anymore 
by the way 
l m screwing mark helford 
hmm

l was just getting
myself a lemonade 
do you want one 
no  that s okay 
looked like michael
and you were having
a bit of a fight 
no 
lt s nothing  really 
anything l can
help you with 
no  it s cool 
you sure 
something seems to
be troubling him 
maybe the two of us
can help him work it out 
l don t know  it s just   
l don t get it 
he s been such a jerk lately 
lt s called being a guy 
we re all jerks 
that s why you women like us 
we re like projects
you take on 
 chuckles 
see  kelly 
young women like you
seem to mature faster 
lt takes boys a little
ionger to catch up 
you know 
you might be a part of
the harding family one day

think of me as you would
the others  as family  too 
yeah  l do
