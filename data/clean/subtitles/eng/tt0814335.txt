lived in a rented room
where he met the victims
both rooms were owned
by older women

she never asked him
for any identification
shay no hes smart

no drivers license
required for registration
tylar no credit cards

david hey
hey mom
howd it go with
jackie and leah
we decided we
should go to vegas
lll be right back
wheres michael
hes in his room
l think hes a little upset
that his father never showed
that is so typical of jay
honey
yeah
l have a confession to make
l accidentally
broke the crystal vase
that was in the living room
laughs in relief
thats okay
lt was a wedding
gift from jays sister
l never liked it anyway
you didnt
mmmmmm
or her
then l dont feel so bad
you dont think
its a little weird
that l ask for some
background information
and suddenly
he doesnt want to sell
real estate anymore
not necessarily
l like david
hes a gentleman
he always picks up the tab
jay was so cheap
do you know what l
do think is weird though
he always pays in cash
who doesnt
want the miles
you know l never thought
l would ever say this
but l think lm
gonna give jay a call
l mean if hes not
buying this either
then maybe its
worth checking into
hey he didnt show up
no
lm so sorry
thats okay
no its not okay
hes never been
there for you like
a father should be
and part of thats my fault
because l never
should have allowed it
to go on as long as it did
thats why davids
so important to me
because he cares
about you kids
he wants you to be here
and be part of your lives
hes so perfect isnt he
take those off
l thought youd be
able to see how happy
david makes me
he is part of
this family now
l want him in my
life and our lives
and you need to
understand that
do you understand that
michael
yeah l understand okay
okay
sighs frustratedly
david typing on cell phone
david are you down
lm just putting
some things away
lll be right up
okay
sighs
vibrating
sorry l didnt make it
definitely next time
but l did check out
your soontobe stepfather
l still dont like him
but at least
he seems to be
who he says he is
lt was good seeing you
michael dad

lm guilty
making it
easier to
murder your sweet memory
chattering on police radlo

doorbell chimes
hey
college applications
my adviser said we
should file early in case
we dont get into u of o
okay
come on
lm coming
lt all sounds
circumstantial
at best to me
l know l know it does
l know it does
but lm telling you
its really starting
to give me the creeps
just think about it please
one day
this woman tells my mom
about this show that she saw
and the next shes dead
shes dead now
lt was an accident
you said so yourself
so how does he know that
she broke her neck
falling down the stairs
how does he know that
the mailman never
said anything about that
l heard the whole
conversation l swear
l wish l could tell
my mom about this
lf you bring
this up to your mom
shes gonna send you back
the funeral playing
lm coming up only
to show you wrong
hey you got to admit
the comment at
the dinner table
about the woman
who killed her kids
was kind of weird
come on it was
weird to say the least
and then his daughter
how do you mix up
your daughters
name like that
he didnt
her name was lisamichelle
thats what you said he said
l said he said that
but you werent there
right
you didnt see his face
its in his face
let me get this straight
all right
the neighborhood weirdo
yeah
sees a show
about a man who
kills his family
and then you think
that david mixed up
the name of his daughter
so therefore
hes the guy that
killed his family
l dont know
yeah that all
adds up to me
really too late to call
look you said
your dad checked
up on him right
and everything was cool
yeah
okay then right
lts fine relax
to know me as hardly golden
are we gonna finish these
babe come on
damn it michael
is to know me all wrong
they were
at every occasion
lll be ready for a funeral
michael
youre obsessing
you know youre just
a little freaked out
that your moms
marrying a stranger
l was the same way
when my mom was
gonna marry jack
you know and then
he turned out to be cool
lf youre gonna
obsess about something
you should obsess
about something that
really matters
like what
like me
l dont want to have
another longdistance
relationship with you
whispers so keep
your eye on the ball
lm coming up only
to show you wrong
lm gonna pick
up sean and beth
lll be back in an hour
will you two be all right
yeah why wouldnt we be
lll see you in
a while then behave
engine starts
come on
what are you gonna do
lm just gonna look

l almost pissed my pants
l was so scared
you know thats not
a turnon by the way
michael shut up
lm being serious
l know l know
you do
yeah l mean
lve been thinking about
what you said
about all of it really
and lve decided that
that youre right
l mean maybe maybe
l am obsessing
you think
l mean my dad said
he was all right so
l guess the rest of it
is just me freaking out
l think you should
come by tomorrow
and well get these
college applications finished
no more obsessing
no no no
l swear on my life
all right
so lll see you tomorrow
okay good night
okay night
knocking on door
yeah come in
hey you got a sec
sure whats up
how you doing
uh fine
maybe lm wrong
but for a while there
l thought we were
off to a good start
and now lm getting the
feeling that somehow were
not on the same page
l know it cant
happen overnight michael
but for the sake
of the family
you gotta understand
that things are going
to change around here
lts not gonna
be like it was
but hopefully better
yeah l do l know
good
l just want you to
always be upfront with me
no lies
no sneaking around
your mom wouldnt like that
and you need to
win back her trust
l dont want to see you
have to go back to
that school again
floor creaks
you swore on your life
just look at the
police sketches
please
thats all lm asking
there is a resemblance
you got to admit
it kind of looks like him
you know who this
actually looks like
it looks like mr rockwell
our biology teacher
from freshman year
no you hardly looked at it
all right
it could be anybody
look this is grady edwards
the police couldnt match
his id
they couldnt
trace any fingerprints
and there are similarities
he said he was in sales
he said he traveled a lot
they can never find
any pictures of him either
so l asked beth
this morning
if she could find any
pictures of him in the house
any pictures of david
there arent any because
he doesnt like having
his picture taken apparently
so what
neither do l
but l swear
l didnt kill that woman
and her kids okay
lt doesnt prove anything
the website was in
the browser history
he was checking it out
so what if he was
or maybe it was your mom
or maybe they both
were because they were
curious about what
mrs cutter said
l mean thats what
made you check it out
all right
lts fine
just forget about it
are we gonna
finish these michael
hold on one second
what is it
you just dont want to go
to college with me anymore
by the way
lm screwing mark helford

myself a lemonade

and you were having
a bit of a fight
no
lts nothing really
anything l can

something seems to
be troubling him
maybe the two of us
can help him work it out
l dont know its just
l dont get it
hes been such a jerk lately
lts called being a guy
were all jerks
thats why you women like us
were like projects

chuckles
