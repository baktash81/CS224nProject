  here s a story i hope
  you ll like
  it s the one about the girl

    i know
  hi  red 
  it s a tired old tale
but it still rings true
  hey  red 
    she could never be rude
    or unkind
  hey 
  but a sad song played
at the back of her mind
  oh
  oan someone show me a different day
  to take me away
  take me out of the woods
  great big world
  you know what i m wanting for you
  you know what i m wanting for you
  what i m wanting for you
  wanting for you
ahh

  hey  boingo 
aren t you helping the muffin man today 
oh  he closed up shop 
someone took all his recipes last night 
and now i m out of a job 
gee  boingo  i m really sorry 
are you still running the cable car 
yeah  yeah  i am 
but it s nothing like
making goodies all day 
would a carrot crumpet
make you feel better 
oh  boy  oh  boy  thanks  red 
i can always count on you to deliver 
you little rascally devil 
yeah  well  the woods
don t go around by themselves 
shut it down 
  oome on  let s go 
  where are we going now  mama 
with the goody bandit
on the loose 
recipes were becoming
an endangered species 
i decided to call granny 
if anyone would know what to do 
she would 
i don t know what to do 
i m just a tired old lady 
your recipes are the most famous
in the whole forest  granny 
what if they get swiped 
it could wipe you out 
maybe i should bring you
the recipe book  for safekeeping 
a trip up the mountain
is too dangerous for a little girl 
i m not so little anymore 
please  dear  you just keep the recipes
there  and everything will be fine 
  but   
  i have to go now  my program s on 
kisses 
what you reading  red 
 far away places  
  are you going somewhere far away 
  no  the world is too dangerous 
oan t see  danger  turn into the skid 
i m ok  i ll walk it off 
you can t go away 
who s gonna ride the goody bike 
if i had wings like you 
i d fly all the way past that mountain 
and the next one and the next one   
but i can t  i m just a kid 
i m just a woodpecker 
uh oh 
 you re next  
what    what does it mean 
 you re next  
ruined 
it means someone wants our recipes 
are they gonna get your recipes 
not today 
so you deliberately
took your granny s recipes
from the family vault 
without permission 
  help yourself 
  and then 
you set out on a dangerous journey
up the mountain   
      alone 
  yeah  i guess i did 
   critters have feelings 
   well  critters have feelings 
   critters have feelings 
   well  critters have feelings too 
   critters have feelings 
critters have feelings
i guess running the cable car s
not so bad  you know 
it s a great way to see the forest
without worrying about all those big 
mean  hairy beasts out there 
  beasts 
  oh  yeah  you know  beasts 
the wolves and the bobcats
and the mountain lions
and the saber tooth tigers 
but mostly wolves 
mostly wolves 
the forest can be a dangerous place for
a little guy like me  with my cute   
look at me  i m fuzzy   
you deliver up this far 
well  not usually 
but i was thinking
about what you told me earlier 
about the muffin man 
i need to protect granny s recipes
from that bandit s evil plan 
they re gonna shut down everyone
in the forest if we re not careful 
aaah  aah  aah

everyone thinks you are

   from all the fame 
and the pain that she brings

a ball of four foot three
   with the money for nothing 
and her tricks for free
   seventy five  alive 
and a hardcore biddy
   still making half pipe 
hand plants look pretty
   in the woodie with the goodies 
for the jacks and jills

   she likes to stomp around 
   she buckles on her shoes 
to make it loud
   singing the wheels on the bus 
go round and round
   i hold her ankles up 
so she can dangle upside down
  an avalanche is coming
and i do not feel prepared

eventually i was able to use
the squirrel to break down the door 
ow  that hurts 
i m taking granny down 
and you re next 
i could ve handled
that wolf myself 
but then the craziest thing happened 
honey  don t look
at your granny like that 
i m sorry  i thought you were triple g 
or are you the bandit 
awkward 
  you re being ridiculous  red 
  i m being ridiculous 
you re off living     la vida loca  
risking your life for some dumb thrills 
and i m supposed to stay home
and be your happy little delivery girl 
  i have a   
  ooffee break  anyone 
  yeah 
  who s got my keys 
you think granny would mind
if i went through her garbage 
  excuse us 
  i thought you were happy 
  excuse us 
  i thought you were happy 
open your eyes 
i ve never even been outside the forest 
don t you think i want more than that 
of course you do  you re a puckett 
i don t know what that means anymore 
  hey  look  it s little red 
  no  it s just some kid 
  she s not wearing the red hood 
  there she goes 
  excuse me 
  little girl 
   everything is changing 
   you re looking for the cure 
   and you feel like 
you re the loneliest girl
   in the world 
   trouble in your head  now 
   you don t know what to do 
   seems like up is down and red 
   is blue 
   because red is blue 
   doesn t make much sense 
   but red is blue 
   oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
how do you remember
all these recipes 
they re all right here
in this book 
every recipe in here
comes from the puckett family 
generation after generation  see 
now  there s sylvia puckett
at the north pole 
she found the best hot chocolate
in the world there 
and there s emma puckett 
she flew cheesecakes
across the atlantic 
for as long as critters
have had a sweet tooth 
pucketts have been making
and collecting recipes
all over the world 
refining them  giving them
that special puckett touch 
so you see  red 
when you put that hood on 
you carry on a grand tradition 
it s a big job  making sure
the world stays sweet 
huh  what s this 
oh  it says 
 world s greatest grandma   
grandma  i can read 
it says 
 battle of the iron oage gladiators   
a  ha  ahh 
  granny 
  listen  munchkin 
if there are two things
your granny doesn t do 
it s lie and play extreme sports 
   in your heart there s a room 
where you lock away
   all the times 
and the things that she said
   and now red is blue 
   oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
   oh  oh  oh  oh  oh   
  is it a flush that beats a full house 
  no  that s a full house 
  is it a flush that beats a full house 
  no  that s a full house 
  it s not my turn 
  i know about houses 
i built mine out of straw 
i m not an idiot 
am i gonna get to put the cuffs
on someone  or what 
remember  ted 
pieces of a puzzle make funny shapes 
but they still fit together in the end 
boy  you re just full of those 
aren t you 
we are closer to the bandit
than we ve ever been before  chief 
the clues to find him
are right here in this room 
in this room 
that s what i ve been saying 
are you telling me
we re back to square one 
hold on  smokey 
where s the fire 
timmy  it s tommy 
you there  over 
am i talking to the wall 
if you don t have your walkie 
don t talk to me 
but if you got your walkie  let s talk 
put everybody in cuffs 
i m taking them all in 
it s what i do 
that s why i m police chief 
timmy  it s tommy  pick up 
if you re there  pick up the walkie 
what are you doing this weekend  over 
we ve got this place
locked down  all secured 
it would seem that all of you
came together tonight by mistake 
maybe you naughty neighbors butted heads
so we could get to the real truth 
  the goody bandit 
  that s right 
the bandit s still at large 
there s been a lot
of finger pointing tonight 
but now all fingers point to the bandit 
  not my finger 
  oh  no 
you were just out
damaging forest property 
cutting down the redwoods
we all call home 
big guy like you  you could
probably take whatever you want
from little goody loving creatures 
but someone robbed me 
have we lost track of that 
that s right  someone did 
maybe a snack food competitor 
right  granny 
now  hold on a pea picking minute 
i may lead a double life
full of secrets and deception 
  but that s no reason to be suspicious 
  huh 
a woman like you could have a lot
to gain stealing all those recipes 
and that s how she makes
her goodies so good  huh 
or she could just be another victim   
  what 
      of a hungry wolf 
the wolf did it  talk about profiling 
why should we trust someone
who wears disguises for a living 
  maybe he s not a wolf at all 
  you got me  i m a poodle 
  just haven t been to the barbershop 
  is this all just a big joke to you 
  i just followed the girl here 
  you leave my granddaughter alone 
yes  now we get to little red 
the girl with the basket on the run 
  where is she  anyway 
  i was just   
the recipes are gone 
  are you saying red is the bandit 
  not my red 
oalm down there  triple g 
the only thing your
granddaughter is guilty of
is flying hummingbirds
without a license 
it would seem there is
another player in this game 
someone who s hippity hopped
his way through all of your stories 
yes  there s someone else 
the only one who was with red
when she fell   
  ohh 
  no 
   who knew a shortcut to granny s   
oh  yeah  in fact  i know a shortcut 
   who fraternizes
with evil ski teams   
  what s your name 
  put   to my biggest and cutest fan   
   and someone who was there
when the schnitzel truck
was schnitzeled 
what the schnitzel 
not the bunny 
  i knew it  never trust a bunny 
  never trust a bunny 
  uh  chief 
  yeah 
no one s seen the bunny or the girl 
and that cable car left the station 
i think we need an apb out
on something small and fuzzy 
i think you re right 
get your boys to red s place 
we need to head off that cable car 
and bring in a police sketch artist 
no  make it a cartoonist 
we gotta hurry to beat it down 
bill  get everyone in the cars 
tommy  you can bring that evidence
with you  let s go 
  you heard the chief  let s move it 
  not in the same car 
keep it moving 
there s nothing to see 
  who s got my keys 
  shotgun 
  did you get any shots of the bunny 
  the bunny  why 
i told you to take pictures
of everything 
ohh  we gotta get this to print
before it s all over the forest 
something don t sit right
in my bones about this 
  what s that 
  maybe it s your bones 
i smell schnitzel 
what have they done
to my schnitzel truck 
why are they going up 
there s on old cable car station
at the top of the mountain 
we ve got to follow them  boys 
red s up there  i know it 
get down the mountain 
you gotta stop those cops 
run  em off the road 
dangle a donut  i don t care 
  tell  em they re going the wrong way 
  eezie peezie  leave it to me 
you ll never catch  em in time

   to stand back

keith  you know 
oh  watch out for keith 
  you re crazy 
  maybe so 
but i m top of the woods now  baby 
  when you re
  hopping on down the bunny trail
  the critters all seem to look down
  you re fuzzy and small
your ears are too tall
  and goodies make the woods go round
  now  i m not a pig
but you gotta think big
  when you re competing
with the girl in the hood
  so you won t be a fan of my evil plan
  but i m gonna be top of the woods
  now the kids will be packed
with my boingo snacks
  oonstruction begins in a day
  and all of the bears
will be ruled by the hare
  as i maniacally plot
from my evil lair
we ve really grown in the past year 
nabbing all the recipes was phase one 
now phase two is adding
my own special ingredient
to every goody 
a little something
i like to call  boingonium   
it makes my snacks a little more   
habit forming 
happy customer 
phase three gets a little messy 
i m gonna need a lot of real estate
down the mountain 
so i ve gotta blow the competition away 
oh  and that s not a metaphor 
we ve literally got
to blow them away  ok 
yeah  i got it 
and now that i have
your granny s secrets 
i m afraid you ll be taking
the dyno mite express home 
  you won t be disrespecting
this bunny no more
