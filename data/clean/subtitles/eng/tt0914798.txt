like in one of your books
but this is the best house ever
well you never know the house
were going to might be even better
dad says its got a garden
mmmhmm
look the thing is bruno
the thing about being a soldier
is that life is not so much about choice
its more about duty
so if your country needs
you to go somewhere you go
now of course going somewhere else
is much easier
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you
upbeat music playing

die die
die die
gasps

soldier shouting

pavel groans
bruno
have you looked in the cellar
the cellar
for your football
oh
grunting
crashing
damn
gretel ive just seen all your
all my what
all your dolls down in the cellar
dolls are for little girls
its not right to play with silly toys
while people are away
risking their lives for the fatherland
buzzing
my peoples density is my density
destiny
its struggles and its sorrows
its joys and its miseries are mine
i must work and create
for the resurrection of my fatherland
the history of my people
is great and glorious
and its 1200
im sorry
isnt that when we finish
the termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide bruno
not the pupil
now will you please continue
bruno there you are
im just going into town for an hour
do you want to come
you be careful on that thing
thank you
bruno can i ask you something
why do you people
wear pyjamas all day
theyre not pyjamas
well those
we have to
they took all our other clothes away
who did
the soldiers
the soldiers why
i dont like soldiers do you
i do quite my dads a soldier
but not the sort that takes
peoples clothes away for no reason
what sort then
well hes the important sort
hes in charge of making
everything better for everyone
so is your dad a farmer
no hes a watchmaker
or was most of the time now
he just mends boots
its funny how grownups
cant make their minds up
about what they want to do
its like pavel
do you know him lives over there
he used to be a doctor
but gave it all up to peel potatoes
can i ask you another question
what do you burn in those chimneys
i saw them going the other day
is it just lots of hay and stuff
i dont know
were not allowed over there
mama says its old clothes
well whatever it is it smells horrid
chuckles
i wish
youd remembered the chocolate
yes im sorry
i know perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime
i cant can i because of this
but thats to stop
the animals getting out isnt it
animals
no its to stop people getting out
are you not allowed out
why what have you done
im a jew
i think i should go now
will you be here tomorrow
ill try
goodbye then
bye
men singing in german
knock on door
little present sweetheart
singing continues
thank you mummy
have you seen bruno
outside on his swing i think
yes thursdays perfect
ill have a car come to collect you both
are grandma and grandpa coming
hey did you smell
that horrible smell the other day
coming from the chimneys
father what sort of ill
the day i fell off the swing
did you smell it mum
father father
mum
let me speak to her
yes she is i can hear her
sighing
yes we look forward to it goodbye
is grandma not coming
no
shes poorly apparently
but grandpas coming
did you smell it dad
what
that horrid smell from the chimneys
what is it
i think they just burn rubbish
there sometimes
look
what
gretel hey
mother gretel
chuckles
hey thats not fair
gretel
what
its only a game
ralf this tutor you brought in
does he usually teach children
as young as gretel and bruno
i believe so why
well do we know
what hes teaching them
gretel seems to have become so
theyre being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment
they mustnt get left behind
come on
lets get to bed
the jew slandered us
and incited our enemies
the jew corrupted us
through bad books
he mocked
our literature and our music
everywhere his influence
was destructive
the eventual result of which
was our nations collapse
and then
yes bruno
i dont understand
a nations collapse
is all down to this one man
the jew here
means the entire jewish race
if it had been just one man
im sure something
wouldve been done about him
there is such a thing as a nice jew
though isnt there
i think bruno
if you ever found a nice jew
you would be
the best explorer in the world
continue gretel
gretel the aim of the jew
is to become the ruler of humanity
the jew is not creative
but destructive
he is the enemy of culture
thousands of germans
have been made poor by the jew
whirring
master bruno
what are you doing youve just
had your lunch havent you
i was going for a walk
and i thought i might get peckish
but dont make a mess of your satchel
bring it here
ill wrap it properly for you
no its none of your business
bruno what is it
what are you doing with your satchel
herr liszt gave us some books
im going out on the swing to read
let me see
what
the books
no
bruno i just want to see
what books herr liszt has given you
i told a lie
what
ive just got
adventure books
chuckling
go on off you go then
now maria
theres two extra for supper tonight
the kommandants father will be here
and i believe
lieutenant kotler is joining us
here
grunts
panting
whats the matter
dont throw it back
what why not
its dangerous
dangerous
its just a ball come on
do you not like playing
just not ball games
not here
tell me how the number game works
i told you its not a game
we just all have numbers
whistle blows
soldier ordering
shmuel
bruno what are you doing
my ball went over
i was just getting it back
huffs
they smell even worse
when they burn dont they
what
but surely you
elsa i was sworn to secrecy
from your own wife
yes
i took an oath upon my life
do you understand
elsa you believe in this too
you want this country to be strong
no ralf no no not that
how can you
because im a soldier
how can you
soldiers fight wars
that isnt war
its a part of it its a vital part of it
the fatherland we all desire
all of us you included
cannot be achieved
without work such as this
crying
elsa elsa
get away from me get away from me
grandpas here
i dont believe this
grandpas here
well be through in a moment
who told you about this
hows grandma
shes a bit under the weather
im afraid
its a shame she was so much
looking forward to seeing you
perhaps next time if she feels up to it
grandpa absolutely
you know ralf
your mother really is sick
shes been talking about this visit
for weeks
maybe thats whats made her sick
grandpa so your father tells me
that youve got a tutor
yes hes nice
bruno but he wont let us read
any adventure books
all we do is boring old history
grandpa let me tell you something
young man
if it wasnt for history we wouldnt
all be sitting around this table
the work your father is doing here
history in the making
when i was your age history was
my favourite subject by miles
which obviously
didnt please my father
hmm why not
well he was a professor of literature
at the university
really does he still teach
i dont really know
you dont know
were not in touch my father and i
he left the country some time ago
really when
about four years ago
herr kommandant
but surely he cant be very old
what is he still in his 40s late 40s
where did he go
lieutenant kotler
your father the professor of literature
where did he go
i believe it was switzerland
herr kommandant
father how strange that he should
choose to leave the fatherland
at the very moment it needed him most
just when were all required
to play our part in the national revival
more wine
what reason did he give
was he tubercular
kotler herr kommandant
did he go there to take the air
im afraid i really dont know
herr kommandant
youd have to ask him
well that would be rather difficult
wouldnt it
with him being in switzerland
come on
whats the matter with you tonight
yes perhaps that was it
perhaps he was ill
unless of course
he had disagreements
i mean with government policy
grandpa one hears of such men
disturbed most of them
or just plain cowards
father even so all of them traitors
grandpa absolutely right
presumably
if that was the case with your father
you will have informed your superiors
as is your duty
lieutenant kotler
you cretin jew filth
pavel grunting
ralf
kotler jew
bruno but dad just sat there
what did you expect him to do
the jew deserved it
can i ask you something
about the farm
oh bruno you dont still think
its a farm do you
its a camp whats called a work camp
for jews obviously
just jews
because theyre the best workers
theyre not in there
because theyre good silly
theyre no good at anything
theyre in there because theyre evil
theyre the enemy
the enemy
but i thought we were fighting
theyre evil bruno
evil dangerous vermin
theyre the reason
we lost the great war
havent you been listening to anything
herr liszt has been telling us
no not really
dads not horrible is he
hes a good man
of course he is
but hes in charge of a horrible place
its only horrible for them bruno
we should be proud of dad
now more than ever before
hes making the country great again
mother like you say
theyre a bit strange a bit
well theyre different
gretel theyre the enemy bruno
evil dangerous vermin
father well you see
theyre not really people at all
what are you doing here
they wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these
were not supposed to be friends
you and me
were meant to be enemies
did you know that
do you want some
whats your dad like
whats he like
is he a good man
youve never thought he wasnt
and youre proud of him
arent you proud of yours
is it really horrible in the camp
door opening
how dare you
talk to people in the house
how dare you
are you eating
have you been stealing food
answer me
no sir he gave it to me
hes my friend
what
little man
do you know this jew
do you know this jew
no i just walked in
and he was helping himself
ive never seen him before in my life
you finish cleaning the glasses
when i come back
well have a little chat
about what happens to rats who steal
come away
exclaims
narrator on film new arrivals
here are happy to discover
that life in the camp
is not all work
and that theres
ample opportunity for leisure also
at the end of their day
at the ironmongery
or the build or boot factory
the workers can enjoy
the many forms of pastime
that the camp has to offer
organised sport is very popular
those that dont play
certainly enjoy watching
at the end of the working day
the centrally located café
is the ideal place
for friends and families to join together
for a hearty and nutritious meal
the children in particular
enjoy the pastries and cakes on offer
in the evenings
the occasional music concerts
either by visiting orchestras
or indeed by talented musicians
from within the camp itself
are always well attended
other recreations include
reading in the library
pottery cookery art and horticulture
for adult and child alike
almost any activity one could wish for
is available within the camp
all murmuring
splendid
grandpa bravo excellent
father thank you
men laughing
gasps
gasps
goodbye little man
shmuel shmuel
i dont understand
i saw a film about the camp
and it looked so nice
i dont know why i did it
gretel and everyone
were saying all these things
and that soldiers so scary
been coming here for days
but you were never here
i thought maybe
we werent friends any more
shmuel im really sorry for what i did
we are still friends arent we
phone ringing
wheres kurt these days
i havent seen him for ages
whos kurt
lieutenant kotler
hes been moved to the front
it was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm
would be put to better use there
herr kommandant telephone
in actual fact gretel he was sent there
because he failed
to inform the authorities
of his fathers
lack of loyalty to the party
which was his duty i might add
which was his bad luck
bad luck
well bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal and not his mother
one presumably
doesnt have to report ones mother
father on phone what
when will pavel be back
mum
never stupid
its father theyve been bombed
grandmothers dead
minister the victory
which you have obtained for us
and for all who sleep in him
keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship
with all that wait for thee on earth
and with all that are around thee
in heaven
in union with him
who is the resurrection
and the life who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the holy ghost
ever one god world without end
amen
he cant have that on there
she wouldnt have wanted it
he does
minister almighty god
who by the death of
bruno have you ever been
to a funeral
my grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here
but there werent any funerals
that one there to there
they both died at the same time
what of
i dont know
papa said they must have caught
something on the way here
they had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived
we didnt see them again
sighing this is fun
wish we could do something
a bit more exciting though
that one there to there
this one
this one
no that one
this one to here

chuckling to here
no

both giggling
i dont want you to go away again
no neither do i
father you cant behave like this
mother youre questioning
my behaviour
father it cant continue
mother i know
i cant stand this any more ralf
i cant stay here and be a part of this
father dont you think
there will be questions
mother questions
father well now what does it say
about my ability to carry out my work
if i cannot control my own family
mother work
is that what you call it
father pull yourself together
woman
mother right
just ignore it ignore it
ignore the fact
that the man i married is a monster
even your own mother
couldnt love you
are you happy here
yes very
and you gretel
well i was but i do miss home
i miss my friends
yes im sure and you too bruno
you must miss those friends of yours
no not any more really
i suppose the real question is
if the opportunity arose
would you prefer
to live somewhere else
gretel back home
father no not berlin not yet
somewhere safe say aunt lotties
in heidelberg for example
all of us you as well
no that wont be possible just yet
im afraid
i must stay
and complete my work here
see at the moment
your mother is finding it
she just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere
would you like that
im afraid bruno in life we often
have to do things we dont want to do
the important thing is
your mother does not feel
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood
and the more i think about it the more
i realise shes very probably right
but dad
no
its time for you to move away
is everything all right
we cant find papa
he went on a different work duty
with some of the men
and they havent come back
ive got some bad news too
im going away
how long for this time
thats why its bad its forever i think
mum says this is no place for children
which is just stupid
when do you go
tomorrow after lunch
so i wont ever see you again
yes you will you can come on holiday
to berlin if you like
when everybodys getting on
with each other again
i wish i couldve helped you
find your dad
i really want to make up
for letting you down like i did
that would have done it wouldnt it
helping you find your dad
wouldve been great
like a secret mission
i could dig under
what with that
no but i could bring something
you dont want to come over here

i could come through to your side
whats the point in that
your dads not going to be over here
is he
but id stick out though wouldnt i
if i came through
i dont look like you
whistle blows
you could look like me though
if you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off
