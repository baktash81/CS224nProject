 dog barking 
it s me home 
  bye  bruno 
  bye  bruno 
  mother  hello  sweetheart 
  mum  what s going on 
  we re celebrating 
  bruno  celebrating 
your father s been given a promotion 
  that means a better job 
  i know what promotion is 
so we re having a little party
to celebrate 
he s still going to be a soldier though 
isn t he 
yes  my lamb 
yes  just a more important one now 
there s some even more exciting news 
but i think dad wanted
to tell you about that himself 
  moving  where to 
  to the countryside 
that s miles away 
what about karl and leon and martin 
sweetheart  i know it s hard 
but we re all having to say goodbye
to our friends for the time being 
anyway  we ll make new ones
where we re going  won t we 
of course you are 
you ll make lots of new friends 
bruno  you can have your friends
around in the morning before we go 
think of it as an adventure 
like in one of your books 
but this is the best house ever 
well  you never know  the house
we re going to might be even better 
  dad says it s got a garden 
  mmm hmm 
look  the thing is  bruno 
the thing about being a soldier 
is that life is not so much about choice 
it s more about duty 
so if your country needs
you to go somewhere  you go 
now  of course  going somewhere else
is much easier
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you 
 upbeat music playing 
bruno  you re getting bigger
every time i see you 
it s only been a week  nathalie 
well  perhaps it s me
that s getting smaller 
 all laughing 
so  you two 
well  what do you think of all this 
moving out of berlin 
well  mummy and daddy say
it s a good thing 
  so i suppose it must be 
  hmm 
children  be angels  will you 
pass some food around 
 all cheering 
officers  heil hitler 
man  congratulations 
  doesn t he look wonderful 
  absolutely 
i m so proud of you  my boy 
oh  dear  i sometimes wonder
if this is all down to me 
making you those costumes
for your little plays when you were tiny 
  you used to adore all that dressing up 
  nathalie   
does it still make you feel special 
ralf dear 
the uniform and what it stands for 
mother  it s a party 
let s not spoil things 
 scoffs  me  spoil things 
you should be careful 
airing your views so publicly
could land you in trouble 
you know that 
 scoffs 
so  how long are we losing you for 
my boy 
  until the war is won  i would think 
  well  not so long then 
man   singing  you ve got to smile
when you say goodbye
you ve got to smile as the days go by
and all the time that you re away
i m thinking of you
i ll write and say from day to day
how much i love you
you ve got to smile
when you say goodbye
you ve got to smile
till the clouds roll by
so till we meet again
say cheerio and then
give me a smile
when you say goodbye
 kids laughing 
 imitating machine gun 
mother  bruno 
all right  bruno  time to say goodbye 
  bye bye 
  bye bye 
gretel   time has come
for me to sleep 
 lord  i thank thee for thy keep

 sighs 
 sighs deeply 
what do you think of it  maria 
the new house 
um

but it won t feel like home
until we make it feel like home  will it 
soldier  is he already up 
 whispering  who was that 
one of your father s soldiers  i suppose 
  he looked very serious 
  well  they are  aren t they 
  why are we whispering 
  i don t know 
 chuckles 
  mother  and play with who

you can only see it from my room 
hmm  and there are
some children there 
  yes  quite a few 
  oh  that s good 
  so  i ll be able to play with them 
  i don t see why not 
i ll wait a little bit 
just to see what they re like 
  because they look a bit strange 
   chuckling  the children do 
  well  and the farmers 
  what sort of strange 
 door opening 
i m sorry 
vegetables

bruno  have you unpacked everything 
because i think you should
go back upstairs and finish off 
 breathing heavily 
thank you  ma am 
mother  bruno 
  i told you they were strange 
  who 
the farmers  they wear pyjamas 
 footsteps approaching 
oh  bruno  i was just
coming to look for you 
well  thank you for that 
that was extremely useful 
  i ll be over to see you later 
  of course  herr kommandant 
father  come in 
sit down  sit down 
well  what do you think 
oh  dear 
i want to go home 
you are home  bruno 
home is where the family is 
isn t that right 
bruno  you have to at least
give the place a chance 
i promise you 
it won t be long before you   
why do the farmers wear pyjamas 
i can see them from my window 
the thing is  bruno  those people   
well  you see 
they re not really people at all 
 footsteps approaching 
bruno  who told you it was a farm 
  was it maria 
  no 
it is a farm  isn t it 
mother  yes 
is it to do with your new job 
all you need to know
about my work here  bruno 
is that it s very important
to our country and to you 
we re working very hard
to make this world a better place
for you to grow up in 
but you re not a farmer 
you re a soldier 
bruno  can you come and help me
finish sorting out in the kitchen 
i can still play with them  though 
the children 
 hesitantly 
i don t think so  bruno  no 
like you say  they re a bit strange 
a bit   
well  they re different 
don t worry  my darling 
we ll find you some new friends 
but they won t be the ones
from the farm 
ralf  you promised 
  you said it was miles away 
  it is 
how was i to know he could see it
from the bedroom window 
there was one of them in our kitchen 
 sighs 
 huffs 
  master bruno  how are you today 
  fed up 
maria  oh   
you said the same thing
every day for two whole weeks 
  it s true 
  well  you should be out playing 
  playing with who 
  i don t know  gretel 
  well  you can make your own fun 
  that s what i m trying to do 
one thing s for sure 
sitting around being miserable
won t make things any happier 
 imitating plane engine 
 gasps 
  bruno  what are you doing 
  exploring 
no  no  not in the back 
i told you  it s out of bounds 
  explore at the front 
  but i ve explored it all 
  well  find something else to do 
  like what 
come back in now 
and we ll think of something 
 bombastic music
playing on radio
 soft music playing on radio
so  children  what are you doing today 
  same as yesterday 
  father  and what was that 
  same as the day before 
  except you went exploring 
  i like exploring 
  father  where did you go 
i wanted to look in the back garden 
but mum wouldn t let me 
the back garden 
well  god forbid 
i expect you ll be missing
those friends of yours 
i even miss school 
 chuckling 
well  i never thought
i d hear you say that 
anyway  you won t be missing it
for long 
  really 
  i ve arranged a tutor for you both 
a herr liszt
will be visiting twice a week 
bruno  so we re not going to school 
  school s coming here 
  father  mmm hmm
on an old bicycle  i gather 
hmm 
kotler  it s a bird without the   
 gretel giggles 
 sighs 
good morning  little man 
and how are you this morning 
  can i ask you a favour 
  well  you can ask 
 gretel giggles 
are there any spare tyres around 
an old one
from one of the trucks or something 
well  the only spare tyre
i ve seen around here
belongs to lieutenant meinberg 
 gretel laughing 
  well  is he using it 
  yes  he s very attached to it 
oh  stop it  he doesn t understand 
he s only eight 
you re only 12 
so stop pretending you re any older 
what do you want a tyre for  anyway 
  i want to make a swing 
  a swing 
that does sound exciting 
you 
here  now 
move 
take this boy to the outhouse
in the back garden 
there are some tyres in there 
he will select one 
you will carry it where he asks 
do you understand 
well  little man 
what are you waiting for 
how about this one 
 exclaims 
where s my mum 
she s out 
  when is she back 
  soon  i expect 
but don t worry 
  but i might bleed to death 
  no  you won t 
  will i need to go to hospital 
  no  it s only a small cut 
 cries out 
come on  it s not that bad 
there  all better 
  what s your name 
  pavel 
now  you ve got to sit still
for a few minutes
before you start
walking around on that again 
will you tell my mum what happened 
i think she s going to see it for herself 
she ll probably take me to a doctor 
i don t think so 
  it could be worse than it looks 
  it isn t 
how would you know 
you re not a doctor 
  yes  i am 
  no  you re not 
you peel potatoes 
i practised as a doctor 
before i   
before i came here 
you couldn t have been much good
then  if you had to practise 
 chuckles softly 
now  what are you going to be
when you grow up 
i know  an explorer 
how do you know that 
is it nice on the farm 
 footsteps approaching 
bruno  bruno  what happened to you 
i made a swing 
but i fell off it and cut my knee 
but pavel here  he carried me in
and put a bandage on it 
  go to your room 
  but pavel says i   
don t argue  go to your room 
thank you 
it s not fair  you having this view 
well  i m not swapping 
 bicycle bell rings 
i think school s here 
liszt  no  i mean more recent history 
  are you interested in current affairs 
  yes  very 
so  you ll be aware of the situation
in which our great nation
presently finds itself 
yes  i read newspapers whenever i can
and one of father s men
keeps me up to date
on everything that s happening 
good  and you  bruno 
have you been reading newspapers 
  have you been reading anything 
  books 
good  what sort of books 
adventure books  mainly 
you know  knights in shining armour 
exploring strange lands and stuff 
and silly princesses
always getting in the way 
ah  well  this is why i m here to help 
you re how old now  bruno  eight 
time to get your head
out of those fiction books
and start learning about fact 
time  i think 
to turn your mind to the real world 
and i believe
this would be the perfect start 
die  die 
die  die 
 gasps 
hello 
i m exploring 
  what are you doing 
  we re    we re building a new hut 
bruno  have you got
lots of friends over there 
a few  but we fight a lot 
that s why i like being out here 
i can be on my own 
  i m bruno 
  shmuel 
  sorry 
  i m shmuel 
that s your name  never heard
of anyone called that before 
i ve never heard
of anyone called bruno 
but shmuel  no one s called shmuel 
i live in the house  back there 
  have you got any food on you 
  no 
are you hungry 
how old are you 
  eight 
  me  too 
it s not fair 
me being stuck over here on my own 
while you re over there 
playing with friends all day 
  playing 
  well  that number 
  isn t it a part of a game or something 
  it s just my number 
everyone gets given a different number 
oh  right  then what happens 
 whistle blowing 
  i have to go back now 
  really 
yeah 
it was nice to meet you  shmuel 
and you  bruno 
 soldier shouting 
bye 
mum  i can t find my football 
well  it ll be
in one of your cupboards  sweet 
it isn t  i ve looked 
can i have a piece of chocolate 
a piece  yes 
 pavel groans 
bruno 
  have you looked in the cellar 
  the cellar 
for your football 
oh 
 grunting 
 crashing 
damn 
  gretel  i ve just seen all your   
  all my what 
all your dolls  down in the cellar 
dolls are for little girls 
it s not right to play with silly toys
while people are away
risking their lives for the fatherland 
 buzzing 
   my people s density is my density  
  destiny 
 its struggles and its sorrows 
its joys and its miseries are mine 
 i must work and create
for the resurrection of my fatherland 
 the history of my people
is great and glorious  
and it s 12 00 
  i m sorry 
  isn t that when we finish 
the termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide  bruno 
not the pupil 
now  will you please continue 
bruno  there you are 
i m just going into town for an hour 
do you want to come 
you be careful on that thing 
thank you 
bruno  can i ask you something 
why do you people
wear pyjamas all day 
  they re not pyjamas 
  well  those 
we have to 
they took all our other clothes away 
  who did 
  the soldiers 
the soldiers  why 
i don t like soldiers  do you 
i do  quite  my dad s a soldier 
but not the sort that takes
people s clothes away for no reason 
what sort  then 
well  he s the important sort 
he s in charge of making
everything better for everyone 
  so is your dad a farmer 
  no  he s a watchmaker 
or was  most of the time now 
he just mends boots 
it s funny how grown ups
can t make their minds up
about what they want to do 
it s like pavel 
do you know him  lives over there 
he used to be a doctor 
but gave it all up to peel potatoes 
can i ask you another question 
what do you burn in those chimneys 
i saw them going the other day 
is it just lots of hay and stuff 
i don t know 
we re not allowed over there 
mama says it s old clothes 
well  whatever it is  it smells horrid 
 chuckles 
i wish
you d remembered the chocolate 
yes  i m sorry 
i know  perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime 
i can t  can i  because of this 
but that s to stop
the animals getting out  isn t it 
animals 
no  it s to stop people getting out 
are you not allowed out 
  why  what have you done 
  i m a jew 
i think i should go now 
  will you be here tomorrow 
  i ll try 
  goodbye  then 
  bye 
 men singing in german 
 knock on door 
little present  sweetheart 
 singing continues 
thank you  mummy 
  have you seen bruno 
  outside on his swing  i think 
yes  thursday s perfect 
i ll have a car come to collect you both 
are grandma and grandpa coming 
hey  did you smell
that horrible smell the other day 
  coming from the chimneys 
  father  what sort of ill 
the day i fell off the swing 
  did you smell it  mum 
  father  father 
mum 
let me speak to her 
yes  she is  i can hear her 
 sighing 
yes  we look forward to it  goodbye 
  is grandma not coming 
  no 
she s poorly  apparently 
but grandpa s coming 
  did you smell it  dad 
  what 
that horrid smell from the chimneys 
what is it 
i think they just burn rubbish
there sometimes 
  look 
  what 
gretel  hey 
mother  gretel 
 chuckles 
hey  that s not fair 
  gretel 
  what 
it s only a game 
ralf  this tutor you brought in 
does he usually teach children
as young as gretel and bruno 
i believe so  why 
well  do we know
what he s teaching them 
gretel seems to have become so   
they re being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment 
they mustn t get left behind 
come on 
let s get to bed 
 the jew slandered us
and incited our enemies 
 the jew corrupted us
through bad books 
 he mocked
our literature and our music 
 everywhere  his influence
was destructive 
 the eventual result of which
was our nation s collapse 
   and then    
  yes  bruno 
i don t understand 
a nation s collapse
is all down to this one man 
the jew here
means the entire jewish race 
if it had been just one man 
i m sure something
would ve been done about him 
there is such a thing as a nice jew 
though  isn t there 
i think  bruno 
if you ever found a nice jew 
you would be
the best explorer in the world 
continue  gretel 
gretel   the aim of the jew
is to become the ruler of humanity 
 the jew is not creative 
but destructive 
 he is the enemy of culture 
 thousands of germans
have been made poor by the jew  
 whirring 
master bruno 
what are you doing  you ve just
had your lunch  haven t you 
i was going for a walk 
and i thought i might get peckish 
but don t make a mess of your satchel 
bring it here 
  i ll wrap it properly for you 
  no  it s none of your business 
bruno  what is it 
what are you doing with your satchel 
herr liszt gave us some books 
i m going out on the swing to read 
  let me see 
  what 
  the books 
  no 
bruno  i just want to see
what books herr liszt has given you 
  i told a lie 
  what 
i ve just got
adventure books 
 chuckling 
go on  off you go  then 
now  maria 
there s two extra for supper tonight 
the kommandant s father will be here 
and i believe
lieutenant kotler is joining us 
here 
 grunts 
 panting 
what s the matter 
  don t throw it back 
  what  why not 
  it s dangerous 
  dangerous 
it s just a ball  come on 
do you not like playing 
  just not ball games 
  not here 
  tell me how the number game works 
  i told you  it s not a game 
we just all have numbers 
 whistle blows 
 soldier ordering 
shmuel 
bruno  what are you doing 
my ball went over 
i was just getting it back 
 huffs 
they smell even worse
when they burn  don t they 
what 
but  surely you   
elsa  i was sworn to secrecy 
  from your own wife 
  yes 
i took an oath upon my life 
do you understand 
elsa  you believe in this  too 
  you want this country to be strong   
  no  ralf  no  no  not that 
how can you   
  because i m a soldier 
  how can you   
  soldiers fight wars 
  that isn t war 
it s a part of it  it s a vital part of it 
the fatherland we all desire 
all of us  you included 
cannot be achieved
without work such as this 
 crying 
  elsa  elsa 
  get away from me  get away from me 
grandpa s here 
  i don t believe this 
  grandpa s here 
we ll be through in a moment 
who told you about this 
how s grandma 
she s a bit under the weather 
i m afraid 
it s a shame  she was so much
looking forward to seeing you 
  perhaps next time  if she feels up to it 
  grandpa  absolutely 
you know  ralf 
your mother really is sick 
she s been talking about this visit
for weeks 
maybe that s what s made her sick 
grandpa  so  your father tells me
that you ve got a tutor 
yes  he s nice 
bruno  but he won t let us read
any adventure books 
all we do is boring  old history 
grandpa  let me tell you something 
young man 
if it wasn t for history  we wouldn t
all be sitting around this table 
the work your father is doing here 
history in the making 
when i was your age  history was
my favourite subject by miles 
which obviously
didn t please my father 
hmm  why not 
well  he was a professor of literature
at the university 
really  does he still teach 
  i don t really know 
  you don t know 
we re not in touch  my father and i 
he left the country some time ago 
really  when 
about four years ago 
herr kommandant 
but surely he can t be very old 
what is he  still in his 40s  late 40s 
where did he go 
lieutenant kotler 
your father  the professor of literature 
where did he go 
i believe it was switzerland 
herr kommandant 
father  how strange that he should
choose to leave the fatherland
at the very moment it needed him most 
just when we re all required
to play our part in the national revival 
more wine 
what reason did he give 
was he tubercular 
kotler  herr kommandant 
did he go there to take the air 
i m afraid i really don t know 
herr kommandant 
you d have to ask him 
well  that would be rather difficult 
wouldn t it 
with him being in switzerland 
come on 
what s the matter with you tonight 
yes  perhaps that was it 
perhaps he was ill 
unless  of course 
he had disagreements 
  i mean  with government policy 
  grandpa  one hears of such men 
disturbed  most of them 
or just plain cowards 
father  even so  all of them traitors 
grandpa  absolutely right 
presumably 
if that was the case with your father 
you will have informed your superiors 
as is your duty 
lieutenant kotler 
you cretin jew  filth 
 pavel grunting 
ralf 
kotler  jew 
  bruno  but dad just sat there 
  what did you expect him to do 
the jew deserved it 
can i ask you something
about the farm 
oh  bruno  you don t still think
it s a farm  do you 
it s a camp  what s called a work camp 
for jews  obviously 
just jews 
because they re the best workers 
they re not in there
because they re good  silly 
they re no good at anything 
they re in there because they re evil 
  they re the enemy 
  the enemy 
  but i thought we were fighting   
  they re evil  bruno 
evil  dangerous vermin 
they re the reason
we lost the great war 
haven t you been listening to anything
herr liszt has been telling us 
no  not really 
dad s not horrible  is he 
he s a good man 
  of course  he is 
  but he s in charge of a horrible place 
it s only horrible for them  bruno 
we should be proud of dad 
now more than ever before 
he s making the country great again 
mother  like you say 
they re a bit strange  a bit   
well  they re different 
gretel  they re the enemy  bruno 
evil  dangerous vermin 
father  well  you see 
they re not really people at all 
what are you doing here 
they wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these 
we re not supposed to be friends 
you and me 
we re meant to be enemies 
did you know that 
do you want some 
  what s your dad like 
  what s he like 
is he a good man 
you ve never thought he wasn t 
and you re proud of him 
aren t you proud of yours 
is it really horrible in the camp 
 door opening 
how dare you
talk to people in the house 
how dare you 
are you eating 
have you been stealing food 
  answer me 
  no  sir  he gave it to me 
he s my friend 
what 
little man 
do you know this jew 
do you know this jew 
no  i just walked in 
and he was helping himself 
i ve never seen him before in my life 
you  finish cleaning the glasses 
when i come back 
we ll have a little chat
about what happens to rats who steal 
come away 
 exclaims 
narrator on film  new arrivals
here are happy to discover
that life in the camp
is not all work 
and that there s
ample opportunity for leisure also 
at the end of their day
at the ironmongery
or the build or boot factory 
the workers can enjoy
the many forms of pastime
that the camp has to offer 
organised sport is very popular 
those that don t play
certainly enjoy watching 
at the end of the working day 
the centrally located café
is the ideal place
for friends and families to join together
for a hearty and nutritious meal 
the children  in particular 
enjoy the pastries and cakes on offer 
in the evenings 
the occasional music concerts 
either by visiting orchestras
or  indeed  by talented musicians
from within the camp itself 
are always well attended 
other recreations include
reading in the library 
pottery  cookery  art and horticulture
for adult and child alike 
almost any activity one could wish for
is available within the camp 
 all murmuring 
splendid 
grandpa  bravo  excellent 
father  thank you 
 men laughing 
 gasps 
 gasps 
goodbye  little man 
shmuel  shmuel 
i don t understand 
i saw a film about the camp 
and it looked so nice 
i don t know why i did it 
gretel and everyone
were saying all these things 
and that soldier s so scary 
been coming here for days 
but you were never here 
i thought maybe
we weren t friends any more 
shmuel  i m really sorry for what i did 
we are still friends  aren t we 
 phone ringing 
where s kurt these days 
i haven t seen him for ages 
  who s kurt 
  lieutenant kotler 
he s been moved to the front 
it was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm
would be put to better use there 
herr kommandant  telephone 
in actual fact  gretel  he was sent there
because he failed
to inform the authorities
of his father s
lack of loyalty to the party 
which was his duty  i might add 
  which was his bad luck 
  bad luck 
well  bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal  and not his mother 
one presumably
doesn t have to report one s mother 
  father   on phone  what 
  when will pavel be back 
  mum 
  never  stupid 
it s father  they ve been bombed 
grandmother s dead 
minister      the victory
which you have obtained for us
 and for all who sleep in him 
 keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship
 with all that wait for thee on earth 
 and with all that are around thee
in heaven 
 in union with him
who is the resurrection
 and the life  who liveth and reigneth
with thee and the holy ghost 
 ever one god  world without end 
amen  
he can t have that on there 
she wouldn t have wanted it 
he does 
minister   almighty god 
who by the death of    
bruno  have you ever been
to a funeral 
my grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here 
but there weren t any funerals 
that one there to there 
they both died at the same time 
what of 
i don t know 
papa said they must have caught
something on the way here 
they had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived 
we didn t see them again 
 sighing  this is fun 
wish we could do something
a bit more exciting  though 
  that one there to there 
  this one 
  this one 
  no  that one 
  this one to here 
  no  there 
   chuckling  to here 
  no 
  here 
  no 
 both giggling 
  i don t want you to go away again 
  no  neither do i 
father  you can t behave like this 
mother  you re questioning
my behaviour 
father  it can t continue 
mother  i know 
i can t stand this any more  ralf 
i can t stay here and be a part of this 
father  don t you think
there will be questions 
mother  questions 
father  well  now  what does it say
about my ability to carry out my work
if i cannot control my own family 
mother  work 
is that what you call it 
father  pull yourself together 
woman 
mother  right 
just ignore it  ignore it 
ignore the fact
that the man i married is a monster 
even your own mother
couldn t love you 
are you happy here 
yes  very 
and you  gretel 
well  i was  but i do miss home 
i miss my friends 
yes  i m sure  and you  too  bruno 
you must miss those friends of yours 
no  not any more  really 
i suppose the real question is 
if the opportunity arose 
would you prefer
to live somewhere else 
gretel  back home 
father  no  not berlin  not yet 
somewhere safe  say aunt lottie s
in heidelberg  for example 
all of us  you as well 
no  that won t be possible just yet 
i m afraid 
i must stay
and complete my work here 
see  at the moment 
your mother is finding it   
she just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere 
would you like that 
i m afraid  bruno  in life  we often
have to do things we don t want to do 
the important thing is
your mother does not feel
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood 
and the more i think about it  the more
i realise she s very probably right 
  but  dad   
  no 
it s time for you to move away 
is everything all right 
we can t find papa 
he went on a different work duty
with some of the men 
and they haven t come back 
i ve got some bad news  too 
i m going away 
how long for this time 
that s why it s bad  it s forever  i think 
mum says this is no place for children 
which is just stupid 
  when do you go 
  tomorrow  after lunch 
so  i won t ever see you again 
yes  you will  you can come on holiday
to berlin if you like 
when everybody s getting on
with each other again 
i wish i could ve helped you
find your dad 
i really want to make up
for letting you down like i did 
that would have done it  wouldn t it 
helping you find your dad 
would ve been great 
like a secret mission 
  i could dig under 
  what  with that 
  no  but i could bring something 
  you don t want to come over here 
look 
  i could come through to your side 
  what s the point in that 
your dad s not going to be over here 
is he 
but i d stick out though  wouldn t i 
if i came through 
i don t look like you 
 whistle blows 
you could look like me  though 
if you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off 
i m not shaving my hair off 
  you could cover it with a cap 
  my pyjamas are a different colour 
i could bring some 
there s a hut full of them 
thousands of them 
would you do it  though 
  i want to do it 
  would you dare do it  though 
  i want to help you find your dad 
  i ve got to go 
tomorrow  then 
i ll bring an extra big sandwich 
and don t forget the pyjamas 
bruno 
mum  can i go and play on the swing 
 sighs 
  bruno

all right  go on then 
 panting 
  i thought you weren t coming 
  i m sorry  it wasn t easy to get away 
i m not meant to be out here today
