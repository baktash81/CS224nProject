hector p  valenti 
star of stage and screen  at your service 
my reptilian friend  welcome home 
we re family now 
come 
okay  let s go 
come on  lyle 
i know you don t talk  but you can sing 
you can pack your bags
and start skipping town
hang up that hat
when the show shuts down
but when the world says
you ain t quite world renowned
don t count yourself out yet
when you hit that lonely and lowest low
well  up s the only way left to go
you re meant to reinvent the show
so ain t you glad we met 
turn that dull and dusty solo
to a dazzling duet
maybe we started pretty small
but take a look at us now
take a look at us now
suddenly standing 10 feet tall
take a look at us now
take a look at us now
though we had no way
to stay afloat
we were scared they d say
it was all she wrote
we re ending on a sky high note
somehow
buddy  you were all it took
so take a look at us now
you already owe me for the last show 
yes  but this one s special 
then you pay me up front  in cash 
cash might be a problem 
but i have something far more valuable 
when that perfect plan s
going off the rails
a heap of trouble is on our tails
it s time to polish up those scales
and give it all you got
if you re out of step
if you re out of sync
and you care too much
what those critics think
well  when you find your missing link
they don t get a second thought
 cause in the center of the spotlight
we just might have found our spot
trying our luck with every leap
take a look at us now
take a look at us now
the road could be steady
could be steep
take a look at us now
take a look at us now
thought we might be sunk
upon first glance
well  who d have thunk
that we had a chance 
and life could be
a song and dance somehow
buddy  you were all it took
so take a look at us now
thirty seconds to curtain 
got a full house out there  break a leg 
so even when you re terrified
just smile a smile a mile wide
 cause  bud  when you and i collide
standing side by side
we re gonna take a great big bow
won t you take a look at us now
give us a spotlight and a crowd
take a look at us now
ready to sing our song out loud
take a look at us now
lyle

what is that 
you don t talk  do you 
in the shadow of the city
when the days have disappeared
some might say it s sort of gritty
full of faces to be feared
but there are wonders that are waiting
underneath the midnight sky
we got the stars illuminating
it s a place for you and i
a little space for you and i
at the top of the world tonight
where no one ever has to hide
at the top of the world tonight
you re sitting safe and starry eyed
there is treasure you can find
in something someone left behind
at the top of the world tonight
it can stay this way
at least until the morning light
through the dark
there s someone singing
like an old familiar song
like you fell
into a melody that s bringing
you right here
where you can belong
and there are wonders that are waiting
underneath the midnight sky
and by the stars we re navigating
to a place for you and i
at the top of the world tonight
where no one ever has to hide
at the top of the world tonight
you re sitting safe and starry eyed
there is treasure you can find
in something someone left behind
at the top of the world tonight
it can stay this way
at least until the morning light
at the top of the world
the top of the world
the top of the world tonight
yeah 
yes  it s an emergency 
the city must do something
about these double wide strollers 
you know  just because somebody
made the mistake of having a second child
doesn t mean that
i should be forced off the sidewalk 
into the   
streets 
mumsykins 
have a great day

josh  time to wake up

i have to tell your father 
  no  he ll have him taken away 
  i ll agree with him 
  no 
  thanks for calling  leave a message 
lyle is a good crocodile 
he s just lonely  like i was

can we sit down  though  please 
hey  guys  let s not throw stuff 
can we just settle down 
just a little bit  okay 
just because a record has a groove
don t make it in the groove
come on
when the people start to move
they can feel it all over
they can feel it all over
people  yeah
over
over
people   
this isn t happening 
crocodiles don t belong in houses 
when you re cooking something up
and only trying the tried and true
you stick to the predictable you ve known
measure out the same amounts
every teaspoon every ounce
no surprises
when the rules are set in stone
but when the sugar hits the fan
you make a mess of your perfect plan
and you re facing the face
of something strange and new
if it s not what you had prepared
in the scramble
you can t get scared
let something wild
and wonderful break through
start ripping up the recipe
let go of how it has to be
you forget about right and wrong
when you lose yourself in this song
it s perfect unexpectedly
no   
when you rip up the recipe
living life inside the lines
safe and simple by the book
you keep sweeping the uncertainty aside
but an unfamiliar spice
might bring something extra nice
something twice as good
as what you would ve tried
 cause when the sugar hits the fan
you make a mess of your perfect plan
and you re facing the face
of something strange and new
something s ready to wreck your day
you can pray that it goes away
or let something wild
and wonderful break through
start ripping up the recipe
let go of how it has to be
no  you can t plan it in advance
gotta lose yourself in the dance
it s perfect unexpectedly
mom 
when you rip up the recipe
start ripping up the recipe
and make a little mess with me
you forget about right and wrong
when you lose yourself in this song
it s perfect unexpectedly
when you rip up the recipe
  an8 when you rip up the recipe
  an8   lyle 
  lyle  all right 
three cameras 
all mounted on the roof s perimeter

and a soaring song
redoing our debut
we get to finish what we started
it s a brand new me and you
a brand new me and you
thought we might be sunk
upon first glance

when the world sees
lyle sing and dance  we re gonna be rich

i don t wanna be unneighborly 
really  i don t 
and no one loves music and singing
and dancing more than me  you know 
just not at 3 00 in the morning 
so if you could find it in your hearts
to sign the petition 
and override the school s power
to allow awful families like this   
  okay  now hold on just a second

he s a crocodile  sweetheart

but he is still a crocodile 
he has to learn
to live with the other crocodiles 
  no  no  we can break him out 
  josh 
it s not a bank 
it s a zoo  how hard can it be 
josh  stop

there s only so much we can do 
not all problems have a solution  josh 
no  you don t get to decide that 
not for me  not anymore 
my whole life  i ve been scared 
because you ve been scared 
but i m not scared anymore 
because of lyle 
he changed everything for me 
and not just for me 
for you too  so   
i m not gonna leave here

  josh

you got nothing to worry about 
thank you  sir 
  you okay  bud 
  yeah 
  you sure 
  yeah 
we had nights of endless music
we were dizzy dancing till the dawn
we were free
singing sweet harmonies with the city
but maybe that was someone else s song
back to earth again
you knew where this was headed
and honestly you re better off
better here where you belong
you got caught up in the colors
you got wrapped up in the ride
you thought the feeling was forever
and the stars were on your side
it was lovely while it lasted
but it wasn t meant to stay
still you let yourself get carried away
i guess i let myself get carried away
we got carried away
carried away
got carried away
carried away
so we got mixed up in the madness
but wasn t it a perfect mess we made 
well  you live and you learn
you return
to the safe and the simple
and behind our walls
we fall back into place
back to earth again
you re through with pretending
 cause this is how the ending goes
now you re here where you belong
we got caught up in the colors
we got wrapped up in the ride
we thought the feeling was forever
and the stars were on our side
it was lovely while it lasted
but it wasn t meant to stay
  an8 we just let ourselves get carried away
we got carried away
carried away
got carried away
carried away
carried away
lost in a fantasy
of all we were gonna be
carried away
carried away
it was lovely while it lasted
it was never meant to stay
but we let ourselves get carried away
i guess i let myself get carried away
hey 
can you believe it 
i still can t believe it 
we re gonna be on show us what you got 
that s great 
you deserve it 
listen 
don t give up 
when malfoy escaped  i thought
i d never see him again either 
malfoy  the pet rattlesnake
my crazy uncle ernie gave me 
he was gone for six weeks 
we all thought he was dead 
until the neighbors found him
in the back of their toaster oven 
miracles do happen  josh 
there he goes 
mom  i m fine 
i know you re fine 
i m gonna make sure you stay that way 
come on 
where you going 
  taking the trash out 
  okay 
  be careful 
  be careful 
how could you do it 
i ve asked myself
the same question over and over  josh 
but  you see  i ve got nothing 
no family  no friends 
then why do you keep leaving him 
when lyle choked 
i had to go back and make it on my own 
again  yes 
but i couldn t 
because no one s interested in   
me 
and i owe a lot of people a lot of money 
a lot of money 
so when alistair grumps offered me
that cash  i had to take it 
out of need  out of fear  out of weakness 
and i ve hated myself for doing it 
good  because i hate you too 
but this is not about me  or about you 
it s about lyle 
you know as well as i do 
we can t leave him in that zoo 
so if you have the stomach for it 
if you have the fire in your belly
i know you have 
you have 
you  young man  are going to help me
break that crocodile out of the zoo 
yes  because we have magic on our side 
the power of illusion 
magical magic 
there is no magic  hector 
i ll be at the east gate at 4 a m 
four a m  be there 
join us live tomorrow 
right here in new york city

on the finale of show us what you got

all right 
  an8 the point i m making 
your honor  is that nothing has changed 
so the crocodile sang 
so what 
it wasn t even that good 
oh  you re just impressed
because it was a crocodile 
it was still broken out of the zoo 
and according to every single one
of the city s very own regulations 
it cannot be kept in a domestic residence 
  order  order 
  it s okay 
i m afraid the plaintiff is right 
but who wants to be merely right
when you can be
fabulously triumphant instead 
good morning  your honor  excuse me 
i have some documents here
that were stolen from me
which are
of vital importance to this case 
what documents 
the original deeds
to the house on east 88th street 
how d you get those 
those were under my bed 
i was led to them by a new friend 
why 
  let me see that 
  of course 
those papers date from the time
of my maternal grandmother 
evelyn t  valenti 
not just the woman
who built the house on east 88th street 
but the woman
who was the founder of the new york zoo 
  this is nonsense 
  what 
this is a special deed
granted by the city of new york 
in acknowledgment to my grandmother s
contributions to the city 
and to accommodate
her fascination for the animals 
 the house on east 88th street
is hereby granted
a special waiver
to house any exotic creature as a pet  
certainly your honor cannot be
stupid enough to consider this 
approved 
yes 
your honor  this is ridiculous 
i demand a mistrial 
this is absurd 
wait a second  loretta 
  hey 
  loretta 
keep your filthy hands off of my loretta 
all right  everybody  let s go 
relax  we got time 
i m gonna get the sunscreen 
wait  wait  what s all of this  where    
hector  good morning 
  where are you going 
  get in the car  guys 
hold on  i ve already got lyle
over 200 bookings 
two hundred bookings in new york alone 
once we roll out a national tour 
we re gonna be swimming in cash 
we re not going on a national tour 
we re going on vacation 
on a what 
have you ever
even been on vacation before  lyle 
i got you a floatie 
that s cute 
okay  okay  fine  fine 
we ll do a stadium tour instead 
fewer dates 
but we ll pack in just as many people 
bye 
bye 
bye 
hector 
yes 
i m sorry  kid  but   
do it  malfoy 
does he have an agent 
he does now 
he s got an attitude 
let s go 
and we re off 
how about    
play lyle s music 
but the biggest kick i ever got
was doing a thing
called the crocodile rock
while the other kids
were rocking  round the clock
hey  loretta 
we were hopping and bopping
to the crocodile rock  yeah
croc rocking is something shocking
when your feet just can t keep still
i never knew me a better time
