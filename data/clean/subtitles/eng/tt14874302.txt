such a good job getting it out
were finishing the movie
because its everything

than they are apart
i mean theyre a pair
well circle back to that okay
i have to deal
with whatever is happening here
music
crying
im free
shout
music
lively music
good morning
good morning
coffee
yes please
thank you thats very kind
youre welcome
what are you cooking over there
the only clinically proven
cure for hangover chilaquiles
oh youre appealing
to my wholesome side
chuckles
for my food blog
im honored
i didnt know you had one
you didnt know i have one
because we dont really know
anything about each other
we dont do we

by the way
i like that we dont
know each others names
bye

dude i dont get you
the girl stays over
you make her breakfast
and at the end you just say
goodbye forever
she only stayed for the weekend
i was making sure her stay
in playa mujeres
was really pleasurable
its always the tourists
its easier that way
what about a partner
someone who improves you
as a person
that lasts more than hours
when did you last have
a real relationship
ive created
the perfect relationship
mutually beneficial
no expectations symbiotic
tourists come and go
theres a shared understanding
that things cant go further
its beautiful
and with no distractions
hes such a dick
look at that asshole sleeping
adam snoring
thats why i dont date actors
theyre unstable narcissists
with no perception of reality
not you of course
chris why are we
sharing the car with all this
youd have to ask my now
former assistant larissa
rachel she assured me of it
on the phone
never trust an adult
with braces
ive had this recurring
nightmare all in black and white
where im standing
in animal print pajamas
holding a knife and
about to stab him
but the guilt stops me i turn
around suddenly he gets up
takes the knife stabs me
in the back i bleed out
and my blood is red
its the only part of
the dream that is in color
we get it

i open it and no one likes it
have you ever read some of
the comments on trip advisor

miserable at best
chuckles
no seriously i mean
you have a lot of stuff going on
uh
yeah i mean im pretty
caught up in work
firephina above all
shes great
who wouldnt want
to be a superhero
but sometimes
there is a lot of pressure
because people love her so much
the costume you know
and the catchphrases
and the intensity
people get really into it
and so do i
its a huge part of my life
but sometimes i wonder
who am i
well im a fan
oh no you watched
not of firephina
of you sophie
romantic music

my job is at stake too
you know
its a little different
alejandro
what the hell were you thinking
going off god knows where
do you know how worried
we were for you
not to mention i had to leave la
in the middle of a very
exclusive healing circle
with ashton kutcher and
mila kunis as shamans
so that i could come
looking for you
okay
do i look like
a babysitter to you
huh
do you see me with a little baby
bjorn and some mushed carrots
ready to attend your every need
i have other clients soph okay
i was supposed to be at florence
pughs cookbook release party
at the barnes  noble
at the grove
eating her signature one pan
chicken cacciatore but uh uh
im out here playing
grab ass looking for you
i said i was sorry
i needed to get out of here
my phone died
i stayed at a hotel nearby
we had to call the police
sophie the freaking polic a
okay
and i had to do some very bad
things with a low level intern
at tmz so that this
didnt become
a freaking
international media frenzy
okay i think she gets it
deborah jackson katz from the
studio was here to talk to you
about your standalone feature
and guess who wasnt here
any guesses
the answer is you
you werent here
in the hotel by the sea
and thats a big problem
sister friend
now not even
as one of the hollywood
reporters
35 under 35 entertainment
professionals
but as your friend
you couldve called or texted
so i knew you were okay
okay now you have
two weeks left on this film
i want you
to get demi moores
reiki specialist on zoom
if thats what it takes for you
to pull yourself together
to finish this fantastic movie
capisce
ive had enough
im gonna go eat a taquito
and think about this
and i want you to repent
thank you so much
for not saying anything
duh oh my god
alejandro would be
in more trouble than me
please i care about you and
your heart way more
than this hollywood stuff
plus you looked happy as shit
everyone was looking for her
like idiots
for her to say her phone died
and that she couldnt
let anyone know
can you believe it
shes so selfish
thats crazy
you scared us
i i made a mistake
im sorry
adam to err is human
to forgive is divine
i wanna get back together
sophie i really do
cheating is romantic
if you think about it
look i know i made
a huge mistake
do you really want
to be treated like
just another jen
sophie wilder and firephina
how much do you two
have in common
are you the same person
at this point
well i booked the part when
i was in my early twenties
so you know when you play
a character for that long
they inevitably become
a part of who you are
yeah yeah yeah um
going in depth
sorry to you or the camera
to him
assistant to uh to
im asking him
to me please
okay
the love story between us
is about the unforeseen
and doctor thunder
has been alive for centuries
meanwhile firephina
is the newer young soul
thats fiery right its quite
unexpected that he
would have her as a wingman
why is that
but
because uh
doctor thunder is this bitter
intellectual god type and shes
shes just corky chuckles
sophie corky
adam yeah
shes the keeper of the
sacred flame of kukulcan
reporter okay
well
as part of the vibe
i never caught
i think were getting
to oily territory
which i think we wanna try
to avoid
but thats what i love
about sophie wilder
her enthusiasm for learning
and growing it
i think shes coming along fine
you know what my favorite
thing about adam clark is
whats that
he is such
a skilled snake charmer
all right
i think weve had enough
thanks
great
adam very unprofessional
hey is this about
that lobby boy right
look if you wanna get back at me
or teach me some sort of lesson
i get it but
him really
wow
okay
whatever is going on
between me and alejandro
who is incredible by the way
has nothing to do with you
chuckles
oh yeah is that right
you know what
im not your pet project
youre not better than me
okay
and i dont need you
to be me
and youre a terrible poet
wow
except for that pablo neruda
you played
i did not
this feels incredible
he paid people in college
to write his papers for him
shes making it up
we are firing margo cohen
hey its sophie
we need to talk
can you meet on the beach
dude thats awesome
of course not
we need to talk
its terrible news
thats a bad text
it cant be look at that
it has no punctuation nothing
thats actually good
that means
its open to interpretation
it means she was mad
its okay listen
i think she wants to see you
apologize
and tell you she loves you
really
sure why would she text you
what film do you live in
of course not
no no no
i know life is not a movie
ok maybe this is good news
you know
we almost got caught
its complicated
i need to end this now
listen love is complicated
do you love her go get her
sophie
i was just so overwhelmed
and i treated you unfairly
i
theres no need to apologize
but i like who i am
when im with you

when im with you but
wait wait im not finished
i pretended to be with adam
