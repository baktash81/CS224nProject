what about a partner 
someone who improves you
as a person 
that lasts more than hours 
when did you last have
a real relationship 
i ve created
the perfect relationship 
mutually beneficial 
no expectations  symbiotic 
tourists come and go 
there s a shared understanding
that things can t go further 
it s beautiful 
and with no distractions 
he s such a dick 
look at that asshole sleeping 
 adam snoring 
that s why i don t date actors 
they re unstable narcissists
with no perception of reality 
not you  of course 
chris  why are we
sharing the car with all this 
you d have to ask my now
former assistant  larissa 
 rachel  she assured me of it
on the phone 
never trust an adult
with braces 
i ve had this recurring
nightmare  all in black and white
where i m standing
in animal print pajamas 
holding a knife and
about to stab him 
but the guilt stops me  i turn
around suddenly  he gets up 
takes the knife  stabs me
in the back  i bleed out 
and my blood is red

on the back of a five year old
child named shirley temple 
who they made wear miniskirts

then i have to go to new york
in a couple of months and   
i love new york  it s
crowded and dirty and full
of trash and rats 
but it s so magical 
so what s stopping you
from opening up your place 
honestly 
it scares the shit out of me 
why 
what if i fail 
what if i open it
and no one shows up 
or even worse  what if
i open it and no one likes it 
have you ever read some of
the comments on trip advisor 
they re ruthless 
alejandro  what if
you never try 
 puta madre  
what does that mean 
 puta madre  
it means   
motherfucker 
hi  don t be mad

  no  no  no 
look who s here 
i didn t know you were coming 
  sophie s gone missing

hey  quiet  quiet everybody 
i got this 
we need the schematics
of the building 
i need to get in your main frame 
you understand me 
comprende 
also  we need a couple
of blood hounds 
whatever kind of dogs
you can get 
an article of her clothing 
preferably underwear 
the dogs love it  okay 
oh  my god  why would i ask
an actor to do anything 
 sound of waves 
so 
how s sophie wilder doing 
miserable at best 
 chuckles 
no  seriously  i mean 
you have a lot of stuff going on 
uh   
yeah  i mean  i m pretty
caught up in work 
firephina above all 
she s great 
who wouldn t want
to be a superhero 
but sometimes
there is a lot of pressure
because people love her so much 
the costume  you know 
and the catchphrases
and the intensity 
people get really into it 
and so do i 
it s a huge part of my life 
but sometimes i wonder   
who am i 
well i m a fan 
oh  no  you watched 
not of firephina 
of you  sophie 
 romantic music 
 romantic music

i m not on vacation 
i m here for work 
this was a huge mistake 
my job is at stake too 
you know 
it s a little different 
alejandro 
what the hell were you thinking
going off god knows where 
do you know how worried
we were for you 
not to mention i had to leave la
in the middle of a very
exclusive healing circle
with ashton kutcher and
mila kunis as shamans
so that i could come
looking for you 
okay 
do i look like
a babysitter to you 
huh 
do you see me with a little baby
bjorn and some mushed carrots
ready to attend your every need 
i have other clients  soph  okay 
i was supposed to be at florence
pugh s cookbook release party
at the barnes   noble
at the grove 
eating her signature one pan
chicken cacciatore but  uh uh 
i m out here playing
grab ass looking for you 
i said i was sorry 
i needed to get out of here 
my phone died 
  i stayed at a hotel nearby 
  we had to call the police 
sophie  the freaking  polic a  
okay 
and i had to do some very bad
things with a low level intern
at tmz so that this
didn t become
a freaking
international media frenzy 
okay  i think she gets it 
deborah jackson katz from the
studio was here to talk to you
about your standalone feature
and guess who wasn t here 
any guesses 
the answer is you 
you weren t here 
in the hotel by the sea 
and that s a big problem 
sister friend 
now  not even   
as one of the hollywood
reporters
35 under 35 entertainment
professionals 
but as your friend 
you could ve called or texted
so i knew you were okay 
okay  now  you have
two weeks left on this film 
i want you   
to get demi moore s
reiki specialist on zoom
if that s what it takes for you
to pull yourself together
to finish this fantastic movie 
 capisce  
i ve had enough 
i m gonna go eat a taquito
and think about this
and i want you to repent 
thank you so much
for not saying anything 
duh  oh my god 
alejandro would be
in more trouble than me 
please  i care about you and
your heart way more
than this hollywood stuff 
plus  you looked happy as shit 
everyone was looking for her
like idiots
for her to say her phone died
and that she couldn t
let anyone know 
can you believe it 
she s so selfish 
that s crazy 
you scared us 
i    i made a mistake 
i m sorry 
 adam  to err is human 
to forgive is divine 
i wanna get back together 
sophie  i really do 
cheating is romantic 
if you think about it 
look  i know i made
a huge mistake 
do you really want
to be treated like
just another jen 
sophie wilder and firephina 
how much do you two
have in common 
are you the same person
at this point 
well  i booked the part when
i was in my early twenties 
so  you know  when you play
a character for that long 
they inevitably become
a part of who you are 
yeah  yeah  yeah  um   
going in depth 
sorry  to you or the camera 
to him 
   assistant   to  uh  to   
  i m asking him 
  to me please 
  okay 
the love story between us
is about the unforeseen 
and doctor thunder
has been alive for centuries 
meanwhile  firephina
is the newer young soul
that s fiery  right  it s quite
unexpected that he
would have her as a wingman 
  why is that 
  but   
because  uh 
doctor thunder is this bitter
intellectual god type and she s 
she s just corky   chuckles 
 sophie   corky 
 adam   yeah 
she s the keeper of the
sacred flame of kukulcan 
   reporter   okay   
  well   
as part of the vibe
i never caught 
i think we re getting
to oily territory
which i think we wanna try
to avoid 
but that s what i love
about sophie wilder 
her enthusiasm for learning
and growing it 
i think she s coming along fine 
you know what my favorite
thing about adam clark is 
what s that 
he is such
a skilled snake charmer 
all right 
i think we ve had enough 
  thanks 
  great 
 adam  very unprofessional 
hey  is this about
that lobby boy  right 
look  if you wanna get back at me
or teach me some sort of lesson 
i get it  but   
  him  really 
  wow 
okay   
whatever is going on
between me and alejandro 
who is incredible  by the way 
has nothing to do with you 
 chuckles 
oh  yeah  is that right 
you know what 
i m not your pet project 
you re not better than me 
okay 
and i don t need you 
to be me 
  and you re a terrible poet 
  wow 
except for that pablo neruda
you played 
  i did not   
  this feels incredible 
he paid people in college
to write his papers for him 
  she s making it up 
  we are firing margo cohen 
 hey it s sophie 
we need to talk 
can you meet on the beach  
  dude  that s awesome 
  of course not 
 we need to talk  
it s terrible news 
that s a bad text 
it can t be  look at that 
  it has no punctuation  nothing 
  that s actually good 
that means
it s open to interpretation 
  it means she was mad 
  it s okay  listen 
i think she wants to see you 
apologize
and tell you she loves you 
  really 
  sure  why would she text you 
what film do you live in 
of course not 
  no  no  no 
  i know life is not a movie 
ok  maybe this is good news 
you know 
we almost got caught 
it s complicated 
i need to end this now 
listen  love is complicated 
do you love her  go get her 
 sophie 
i was just so overwhelmed
and i treated you unfairly 
i   
there s no need to apologize 
but i like who i am
when i m with you 
and i like who i am
when i m with you but   
wait  wait  i m not finished 
i pretended to be with adam 
you know what 
it doesn t   
it doesn t even matter 
it s over  i ended that 
and now you and i don t have
to pretend  to hide anymore 
okay  but   
my future is still on the line 
you know  and   
yeah  you re right 
that s a fantastic point 
didn t you say you want
to open up a place 
yeah  but that s
