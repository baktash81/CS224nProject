girl sitting with my mom
and shes singing to me
i feel the warmth
of the sun on my skin
and the comfort of her arms
around me
and i wanna stay there
forever
when i wake up
i miss the dream
i want so badly
for this dream to be real
but that would be impossible
because my mom died
when i was really little
and i cant go out in the sun
like at all
i have a rare genetic condition
called xeroderma pigmentosum
or xp which basically means
a severe sensitivity
to sunlight
if the sun hits my skin
i get skin cancer
my brain starts to fail
and i could die
pretty fun right
so i spend all my time indoors
behind special windows
hanging out with my dad
who is the best dad ever
thank goodness
because growing up
kids were what youd expect
no way
yep a vampire
thats why they have
special windows
dont worry she cant
get us during the day
but at night
stay far far away
but not everyone
was afraid of me
hey morgan
whats wrong with her
she has something called xp
basically the light from
the sun itit hurts her
so she cant ever go in the sun
i cant be in the sun
for too long either
can she play at night
yeah but
see you tonight
and i like pizza
from that point on
it was me morgan and my dad
until one day i saw charlie
and that was it
i was completely
totally utterly hooked
stupid tree
i saw him every day
and yet
he had no idea i even existed
over time
watching charlie go by
just became
a part of my routine
along with constant
doctor appointments
sleeping during the day
and staying up all night
which from what ive heard
is the schedule
of most teenagers
and playing music
every chance i get
all things considered
ive got a pretty great life
but i still hold onto my dreams
stupid tree
no matter
how impossible they may seem
theyre not gonna break us
hey well burn so bright
making all the people
come to life
hey the darkest sky
cant stop me and you tonight
i said hey
well burn so bright
dancing underneath
the city lights
hey from way up high
shining down
like stars tonight

to these appointments with you
yeah well you know teenagers
they get embarrassed
by their dads
she has xp jack
i know exactly what she has
its not gonna

becomes more serious for her

the slightest bit of sunlight
she wont be

any word on the university
of washington study
i submitted katies name for their phase
two trials if it even gets that far

take the joy from a childs life

and in sixth grade you wore a
ken griffey jr jersey every day
for like a month straight
and in ninth grade
you buzzed off all your hair
and
every day
i waited for you
to walk by my window
and it was the best part
of my day

dear charlie
ive always been more comfortable writing
song lyrics than actual sentences
theres no way i can articulate
what youve meant to me
since that moment
we first saw each other
or the joy youve brought me since
i first saw you outside my window
even though our time together
was short
the stars have been burning
for every moment of it
and the light from those moments will be
shining down for the next thousand years
but i have walked alone
i hope that somehow ill be able
to look down and see you charlie
and all of the incredible moments
just waiting for you out there
and if you need me
all you have to do is look up
and remember
i love you
in the darkest sky
i feel so alive
watch movies and series  wwwzocinecom
theyre not gonna break us
hey well burn so bright
making all the people
come to life
hey the darkest sky
cant stop me and you tonight
i said hey
well burn so bright
dancing underneath
the city lights
hey from way up high
shining down
like stars tonight
when its too far
for me to reach it
i close my eyes and believe it
aint no other way to do
when you fall
you gonna hit hard
when you love
with your whole heart
remember the hard times
make you
thats when
well show the world
