girl sitting with my mom 
and she s singing to me 
i feel the warmth
of the sun on my skin
and the comfort of her arms
around me 
and i wanna stay there 
forever 
when i wake up 
i miss the dream 
i want so badly
for this dream to be real 
but that would be impossible
because my mom died
when i was really little 
and i can t go out in the sun 
like  at all 
i have a rare genetic condition
called xeroderma pigmentosum 
or xp  which basically means
a severe sensitivity
to sunlight 
if the sun hits my skin 
i get skin cancer 
my brain starts to fail
and i could die 
pretty fun  right 
so  i spend all my time indoors
behind special windows 
hanging out with my dad
who is the best dad ever 
thank goodness 
because growing up 
kids were  what you d expect 
  no way 
  yep  a vampire 
that s why they have
special windows 
don t worry  she can t
get us during the day 
but at night 
stay far  far away 
but not everyone
was afraid of me 
  hey  morgan 
  what s wrong with her 
she has something called xp 
basically  the light from
the sun  it it hurts her 
so she can t ever go in the sun 
i can t be in the sun
for too long either 
can she play at night 
  yeah  but   
  see you tonight 
and i like pizza 
from that point on 
it was me  morgan and my dad 
until one day  i saw charlie 
and that was it 
i was completely 
totally  utterly hooked 
stupid tree 
i saw him every day 
and yet 
he had no idea i even existed 
over time 
watching charlie go by
just became
a part of my routine 
along with constant
doctor appointments 
sleeping during the day
and staying up all night 
which  from what i ve heard 
is the schedule
of most teenagers 
and playing music
every chance i get 
all things considered 
i ve got a pretty great life 
but i still hold onto my dreams 
stupid tree 
no matter
how impossible they may seem 
 they re not gonna break us 
 hey  we ll burn so bright 
 making all the people
come to life 
 hey  the darkest sky 
 can t stop me and you tonight 
 i said hey
we ll burn so bright 
 dancing underneath
the city lights 
 hey  from way up high 
 shining down
like stars tonight

to these appointments with you 
yeah  well  you know teenagers 
they get embarrassed
by their dads 
  she has xp  jack 
  i know exactly what she has 
it s not gonna
fall into remission 
and every year  the risk
becomes more serious for her 
so  if she s exposed to even
the slightest bit of sunlight   
she won t be 
  she s reached that age we talked about 
  she won t be 
any word on the university
of washington study 
i submitted katie s name for their phase
two trials  if it even gets that far 
i wouldn t get your hopes up 
research funding
being what it is 
we re talking about a disease that
affects only one in a million people 
we re in luck 
 cause she is one in a million 
a cat funeral 
please stop saying it out loud

i could ve made it two hours 
what does katie price wanna do 
there are so
many things i wanna do 
i have always wanted to do this

and it s 16 light years away 
which means the light
we re seeing now 
was actually created
when we were two 
are you okay 
the berkeley coach called
my house the other night 
really 
yeah  i mean  i guess
one of the other swimmers
transferred out
and another spot opened up 
that s so crazy 
you could get your spot back 
i mean  technically  yeah 
there s this huge meet
coming up next month 
and the berkeley coach
is coming down to watch 
but i d have to get in shape by
then  which is probably impossible 
and then i d have
to swim  like 
my best time ever to show
that i m fully rehabbed   
you can totally do it 
there s also some reasons
to stick around here next year 
katie  i wanna take you
on a real date tomorrow

at the train station   
i already knew you 
wh what do you mean 
in elementary school 
you walked by window every day
on your way to swim practice 
and in fourth grade 
you started skateboarding 
and in sixth grade  you wore a
ken griffey jr  jersey every day
for  like  a month straight 
and in ninth grade 
you buzzed off all your hair 
and   
every day   
i waited for you
to walk by my window   
and it was the best part
of my day 
if i had just looked up   
i could ve been with you
this whole time 
you were 
i   
i love you  charlie

 to the darkest corners
of my mind 
 my kingdom is wide 
 so wide eyed
i can t track the time 
 between the spaces of my mind 
  cause i have seen
a thousand things 
 a thousand minds
and what they bring 
i ve waited my whole life to feel this 
 but where i stand
well  i don t know 
 and people come and people go 
 people i will never know

she called him  told him that he
needed to take another look at you

time that she was little

song lyrics than actual sentences 
there s no way i can articulate
what you ve meant to me 
since that moment
we first saw each other 
or the joy you ve brought me since
i first saw you outside my window 
even though our time together
was short 
the stars have been burning
for every moment of it 
and the light from those moments will be
shining down for the next thousand years 
 but i have walked alone 
i hope that somehow i ll be able
to look down and see you  charlie 
and all of the incredible moments
just waiting for you out there 
and if you need me 
all you have to do is look up 
and remember   
i love you
