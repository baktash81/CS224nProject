  yeah 
immigration and customs
enforcement has him now 
 typing 
 mouse clicking 
 indistinct chatter 
 door opens 
 lock buzzes 
 elevator beeping 
i really wish y all
would have come to me sooner 
once a judge makes
the decision 
it s hard to get it overturned 
i just don t understand
how they can deport him 
he was adopted 
when d you come
to this country 
1988 
well  there was a bill
that was passed in 2000
that grants  uh 
citizenship to adoptees 
but it only protects kids
who were adopted after 2000 
looks like maybe
your parents   
they re not my parents 
well 
whoever had custody of you 
looks like they didn t follow
the proper procedure
to change your status 
how s that his fault 
i m not saying it s his fault 
it s a loophole dhs is using
to deport people 
you also have
a criminal record 
kathy 
they dropped the charges 
no charges were filed 
barry 
no  from before 
he has a past record 
ice is targeting people
like you 
adopted or not 
  where were you born 
  korea 
kathy 
we re married 
doesn t that grant him
citizenship 
even if you re married 
the proper steps
would ve needed to be taken
for him to get a green card
or naturalized 
i don t    i don t   
i don t understand 
can t we do something
about this 
h he has two kids 
i mean  listen to him 
look at him 
  he s american 
  it doesn t matter
what he look like 
it s immigration policy 
i was brought here
when i was three 
i ve been here
for over 30 years 
well  sometimes with
these international adoptions
in the  80s  the   
  the proper paperwork wasn t filed 
  yeah  but  like   
like i said  i ve been here
for over 30 years 
okay  can t you
just tell them that that   
that i was   
i was adopted by white people 
 chuckles softly 
i understand your frustration 
i really do  but   
that s not how it works 
now  here are your options 
you can   
depart voluntarily   
no  fuck that 
   and have a chance
of receiving status 
or you can stay and appeal 
but if you do that
and the judge
don t rule in your favor 
you forfeit any opportunity
to return to this country 
what does that mean 
it means 
if he fights and loses 
he can never come back 
 exhales softly 
 exhales 
i m not leaving my family 
at this stage 
we don t have a lot of options 
but let me see
what i can do to get you back
in front of a judge 
so  i need to talk to you
about my retainer fee 
now  i usually charge  5 000
to start 
and then 
depending on how the case goes 
we can talk about that
at a later time 
 insects trilling 
you have a right to be here 
you won t have to leave
 cause they made a mistake 
it s not your fault 
okay 
we re gonna figure this out 
i m gonna borrow some money
from my mom 
  hey  don t do that 
  why not 
we already borrowed money
for the bond 
how are we gonna pay
for the lawyer 
i ll talk to ms  jacci  okay 
don t worry about it 
give me the keys 
 keys jangling 
kathy

on my own 
kathy  you re not responsible

   door opens

a merits hearing 
but i want us to start
preparing ahead of time 
just in case we re granted one 
now  there s some things
that are gonna help
with the hearing 
things that make a great case
for your need to stay 
all right  do you have
any ailing relatives
  that require your assistance 
  uh  no 
how about children
under the age of 18
that would be left alone here
if you were to depart

okay  um  it looks
like you work 
yeah 
so you re not
the sole provider 
uh  no  we both work 
oh  okay 
and you  um  didn t come here
as a refugee 
so there s no threat
of violence in your homeland 
so that doesn t apply 
okay 
it looks like our
best bet here is  uh 
to try to prove that you are
a valued member of society 
which is going to be
quite a challenge
because of
your criminal record 
but at this point 
it s it s all   
it s the only option we have 
now  we re gonna need a lot
of support here 
all right  friends  family 
uh  parents 
uh  members of your church
if you attend one 
anybody that can paint
a picture for the judge
that you re a positive part
of this community

parker  do you know why i like

they can t survive

hmm 
when i was 12   
henry  my dad   
   he told me i got a letter
from my real mama 
at first  i didn t believe him
because why would she send me
a letter after all that time 
he kept talking about it 
every day 
he asked me if i wanted
to see it  i told him no 
but when i finally asked
if i could   
   he told me he threw it away 
like it was nothing 
but then i found it 
what did it say 
it was written
in broken english 
so it was hard to read  but   
   it said she tried
to drown me 
she held me under that water 
i guess she couldn t go through
with it  so she gave me up 
she kept me as long
as she could 
it s okay 
you have to put it on 
just for a little bit 
okay
