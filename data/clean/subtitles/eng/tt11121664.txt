typing
mouse clicking
indistinct chatter
door opens
lock buzzes
elevator beeping
i really wish yall
would have come to me sooner
once a judge makes
the decision
its hard to get it overturned
i just dont understand
how they can deport him
he was adopted
whend you come
to this country
well there was a bill
that was passed in 2000
that grants uh
citizenship to adoptees
but it only protects kids
who were adopted after 2000
looks like maybe
your parents
theyre not my parents
well
whoever had custody of you
looks like they didnt follow
the proper procedure
to change your status
hows that his fault
im not saying its his fault
its a loophole dhs is using
to deport people
you also have
a criminal record
kathy
they dropped the charges
no charges were filed
barry
no from before
he has a past record
ice is targeting people
like you
adopted or not
where were you born
korea
kathy
were married
doesnt that grant him
citizenship
even if youre married
the proper steps
wouldve needed to be taken
for him to get a green card
or naturalized
i dont i dont
i dont understand
cant we do something
about this
hhe has two kids
i mean listen to him
look at him
hes american
it doesnt matter
what he look like
its immigration policy
i was brought here
when i was three
ive been here
for over 30 years
well sometimes with
these international adoptions
in the 80s the
the proper paperwork wasnt filed
yeah but like
like i said ive been here
for over 30 years
okay cant you
just tell them thatthat
that i was
i was adopted by white people
chuckles softly
i understand your frustration
i really do but
thats not how it works
now here are your options
you can
depart voluntarily
no fuck that
and have a chance
of receiving status
or you can stay and appeal
but if you do that
and the judge
dont rule in your favor
you forfeit any opportunity
to return to this country
what does that mean
it means
if he fights and loses
he can never come back
exhales softly
exhales
im not leaving my family
at this stage
we dont have a lot of options
but let me see
what i can do to get you back
in front of a judge
so i need to talk to you
about my retainer fee
now i usually charge 5000
to start
and then
depending on how the case goes
we can talk about that
at a later time
insects trilling
you have a right to be here
you wont have to leave
cause they made a mistake
its not your fault
okay
were gonna figure this out
im gonna borrow some money
from my mom

for the bond
how are we gonna pay
for the lawyer

barry
im in the process
of trying to get you
a merits hearing
but i want us to start
preparing ahead of time
just in case were granted one
now theres some things
that are gonna help
with the hearing
things that make a great case
for your need to stay
all right do you have
any ailing relatives
that require your assistance
uh no
how about children
under the age of 18
that would be left alone here
if you were to depart
uh yeah yeah
i got aa stepdaughter
and i got a daughter
on the way
but would they be left alone
uh no
okay um it looks
like you work
yeah
so youre not
the sole provider
uh no we both work
oh okay
and you um didnt come here
as a refugee
so theres no threat
of violence in your homeland
so that doesnt apply
okay
it looks like our
best bet here is uh
to try to prove that you are
a valued member of society
which is going to be
quite a challenge
because of
your criminal record
but at this point
itsits all
its the only option we have
now were gonna need a lot
of support here
all right friends family
uh parents
uh members of your church
if you attend one
anybody that can paint
a picture for the judge
that youre a positive part
of this community
yeah we can get
some people together
