hey you weasel out of my cart
do you believe in ghosts
ever heard of the blair witch
sounds familiar
my sister went to blair high school
the woods around halloween
are creepy
can you tell me a little more
i dont wanna go cheesy
i want to present
this straightforward
the legend is unsettling
wanna get the
ceremonial first slate
absolutely
the first slate for our
first shot
should we get our fingers open
and bleed on it
a little bloodletting
no well save that for later
kiss the slate
its the first slate
marked by my lipstick
mikey kiss it good luck
there we go
oh he licked it bless him
dont eat it were gonna need it
this is burkittsville
formerly blair
a small quiet maryland town
like a small quiet town anywhere
some 20 families laid roots here
over 200 years ago
many remain either on this hill
or in the town below
an unusually high number of
children are buried here
most of whom passed
in the 1 940s
yet no one here recalls anything
unusual about this time
not to us anyway
yet legend tells
a different story
whose evidence is all around us
etched in stone
we have shot the first scene
the cemetery scene
the opening is shot
were doing a documentary
about the blair witch
have you heard of the witch
thats an old old story
as i remember
mr parr was an old hermit
and he lived up on a mountain
hed been there
for a long long time
you heard of the blair witch
several times
what was the first incident
ive heard stories about it
from people and neighbors
i also saw a documentary on the
television
about her and legends
of maryland
my grandmother told us the story
to make us go to bed early
they say if you stay up after dark
or walk around the house
the blair witch will get you
in the fall or winter of 1 940
some young kids
started disappearing
nobody knew
why they were disappearing
a kind of an omen isnt it
the creepiest story about her
was that two men out hunting
camped near the cabin
shes supposed to haunt
no no
and they just disappeared
forever
im just telling a scary story
but its not true
its not true
one day old mr parr
came into the market
and said lm finally finished
and what did he mean by that
nobody knew at first
but the police finally
went up the mountain
and found the bodies of seven
kids in his house
he would take the kids down
to the basement in twos
and hed make one
face the corner
and hed kill the other one
then hed kill the one in
the corner too
those were the seven kids
that were missing
they brought the kids out of
the woods one at a time
it was terrible it upset
the whole community
he said he couldnt take
the eyes watching him
thats why he made them
face the corner like that
all my life ive believed
in witches and ghosts and
that kind of stuff
do you believe there are some
in this area
oh definitely
do you believe in witchcraft
no
are you religious
yep
alrighty
creepy stuff but i think
somethings happening with her
and do you think she could
still be up there now
i dont go up there
you dont
i believe enough not to go
they say the woods are haunted
and stuff like that
what how are they haunted
well theres not many people
who say that its haunted
but there was this old woman
mary brown who
mary brown
yeah and she was kind of crazy
how was she seen by the community
crazy
theres the american flag
its marys house
im gonna bring her out
you look for the best light okay
okay
this is marys gate
im not even sure how to open it
and something interesting
happened to you once
you met the blair witch
yes
that is really
kind of a scary story
to make ends meet
my dad and i
used to fish at tappys creek
in burkittsville
i was laying on the leaves
watching my pole and
looking at the sky
and suddenly i felt
something near me
an eerie feeling
it was a woman
only on her
arms and hands
and everything
she had hair
dark almost black hair
iike a horse
iike a fur horse fur
then on her arm
she had a shawl
and she scared you
or threatened you
she didnt say anything
she just stared
and then she opened her shawl
what was under there
she had hair on her
body like a horse
hairy from head to toe
yeah and her legs
how about her face
you could see she was a female
she was just strange looking
thank god shes
not in the film business
she thinks she is
she also says shes a ballerina
get out
and she says shes a historian
i heard that
and that shes a scientist
at the department of energy
i fucked up on mary
with the depth of field
you measured it in meters
were not in europe
the fucking lens
has meters on it
it also has our system
nah it has meters look
but its an american camera
all those are meters
what about the brown ones
theyre feet
the brown ones are on there right
yeah but the white
ones are obvious
didnt you use this camera before
yeah once before
how was today guys

1 6 mill

i know you dont like it
hello welcome to day two
the trail is along here
it should be pretty obvious
you guys heard of
the blair witch
i heard the myth i dont
really believe much in it
the myth
thats all i think it is
whatd you say sir
i said damn fool kids never learn
shut up
damn fool kids never learn
thats what i said
why do you say that
first of all can i
have your permission
to use your image on a
video documentary
i dont care about that but
you have to say yes or no sir
watch it
im sorry
yeah sure okay
some girl in the late 1 800s
robin weaver i
believe her name was
supposedly wandered
off into the woods
no supposedly about it
she wandered off
okay wandered off
and got lost
she got lost
wasnt no supposedly
three days later
she appears back on her
grandmothers porch
and everybodys mystified
she was babbling something
her story
babbling something about
an old woman whose feet
never touched the ground
i saw  just by that
tree up the creek
about a hundred yards
i saw a white misty thing
cant tell you what it was
like grey vapor rising
out of the trees
right out of the water
right out of the water
up the side of the trees
then it disappeared
youre full of it
im not and i wasnt
drinking that day either
sure you werent
how is that related to the
story of coffin rock
it all ties in to the
story of coffin rock
hows that
anybody round here
knows that the old woman has
haunted this area for years
thats bullshit
these woods are thick
you excited
you got it
i hope hes not shooting a
whole shitload of stock
i could help but id
rather record
okay
packs on were ready to go
we gotta go up to the shack
yeah
my god this is a very heavy pack
off to coffin rock
i know exactly where we are now
mikey give me the video camera
i wanna get her going across man
i see a dirty behind
good jump
thank you
there it is see
thats coffin rock
they went into the woods
ready to find death
but what they found
was inhumane
at the site called coffin rock
up on the rock the torture
suffered by these five
brave men was obvious
they were tied up one mans
hands tied to the next mans feet
forming a solid
human structure
blood indicated that
it had happened
while they were
alive and resisting
their intestines had been
crudely torn out
and on each of their faces there
was indecipherable writing
cut into their flesh
with precision
the men shocked by
what had happened
went to find the sheriff
without sketching the writing
or touching the bodies
they returned to see
vultures at the rock
but the bodies had been
removed by persons unknown
the stench of death
was still thick
but the bodies had been
taken in a matter of hours
that happened here
at coffin rock
lets rush because i want
to camp and its 452
its late were gonna be
losing light soon
but i can use the shot
without me in it
because i recorded sound
while reading the whole thing
so im sure i can edit
it together somehow
its starting to rain
did you rent this thing
yeah i dont have a
tent for three people
just wondering
i dont usually travel with two men
it is pouring with rain
cant even light a fire
show us what the stick is for
look weve got our
very own leaning post
if it smells of farts
too much in the night
okay so i cant have a
cigarette in the tent
but he can fart as
much as he wants
no i never gave mike
a fart allowance
you heard noises last night
i did
problem is i sleep like a log
there were two separate noises
coming from two
areas over here
one of them could
have been an owl
but the other was a cackling
no way
it was a cackling man
if i heard a cackling
i wouldve shit myself
where did we start yesterday
off the map
i knew where we were going
there was some confusion but today
wait    say that again
i said i knew where
we were going
wait   was that a
full of shit statement
no it wasnt
so that wasnt bullshit
i knew where we were going
you got us lost man

just like my vienna sausage
flames are licking you
like the devil josh
sit back and hear a tale
a tale of a fateful trip
that started on
this desert isle
aboard this tiny ship
yeah but this ship
has a good captain
not a beerguzzling
guy in a blue shirt
he wasnt beerguzzling
they had no beer on
the island man
if they had beer theyd
have had bigass orgies
youre like the captain
and mikes your gilligan
no offense
thats all right
it was a compliment
gilligan was a funny guy
the captain was fat though
well okay lets call
it a thin captain
its not captain
its the skipper
no more captain
here we are back at
the rock again
the cemetery deal
i just wanna be careful
not to get in the shot
it certainly is odd
please tell me you didnt
just knock that over
i didnt just knock that over
thats not very nice
let me put it back
you cant be too careful
whatd you think
it was the same only darker
yeah pretty much
all right bag it up

route to get back
because we went
around in a curve
