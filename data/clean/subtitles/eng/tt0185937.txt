 hey  you weasel  out of my cart 
do you believe in ghosts 
ever heard of the blair witch 
sounds familiar 
my sister went to blair high school 
the woods around halloween
are creepy 
 can you tell me a little more 
 i don t wanna go cheesy 
i want to present
this straightforward 
the legend is unsettling 
wanna get the     
     ceremonial first slate 
absolutely 
the first slate for our
first shot 
should we get our fingers open
and bleed on it 
a little blood letting 
no  we ll save that for later 
kiss the slate 
it s the first slate 
marked by my lipstick 
mikey  kiss it  good luck 
 there we go 
 oh  he licked it  bless him 
don t eat it  we re gonna need it 
this is burkittsville 
formerly blair 
a small quiet maryland town 
like a small  quiet town anywhere 
some 20 families laid roots here
over 200 years ago 
many remain  either on this hill     
     or in the town below 
an unusually high number of
children are buried here     
      most of whom passed
in the 1 940 s 
yet no one here recalls anything
unusual about this time       
      not to us  anyway 
yet legend tells
a different story       
     whose evidence is all around us 
etched in stone 
we have shot the first scene 
the cemetery scene 
the opening is shot 
we re doing a documentary
about the blair witch 
 have you heard of the witch 
 that s an old  old story 
as i remember       
      mr  parr was an old hermit       
     and he lived up on a mountain 
he d been there       
      for a long  long  time 
 you heard of the blair witch 
 several times 
what was the first incident 
i ve heard stories about it
from people and neighbors 
i also saw a documentary on the
television     
     about her and legends
of maryland       
      my grandmother told us the story
to make us go to bed early 
they say if you stay up after dark
or walk around the house     
     the blair witch will get you 
in the fall or winter of 1 940       
     some young kids
started disappearing 
nobody knew     
     why they were disappearing 
 a kind of an omen  isn t it 
 the creepiest story about her     
     was that two men out hunting     
     camped near the cabin
she s supposed to haunt     
no  no 
     and they just disappeared
forever 
i m just telling a scary story 
but it s not true 
it s not true 
one day  old mr  parr
came into the market     
     and said  l m finally finished  
and what did he mean by that 
nobody knew at first     
but the police finally     
went up the mountain     
     and found the bodies of seven
kids in his house 
he would take the kids down
to the basement in twos     
     and he d make one
face the corner     
     and he d kill the other one     
     then he d kill the one in
the corner too 
those were the seven kids
that were missing
they brought the kids out of
the woods one at a time     
     it was terrible  it upset
the whole community 
he said he couldn t take
the eyes watching him     
     that s why he made them
face the corner like that 
all my life i ve believed     
     in witches and ghosts and
that kind of stuff
do you believe there are some
in this area 
oh  definitely 
 do you believe in witchcraft 
 no 
 are you religious 
 yep 
alrighty 
creepy stuff  but i think
something s happening with her 
and do you think she could
still be up there now 
 i don t go up there 
 you don t 
i believe enough not to go 
they say the woods are haunted
and stuff like that 
what  how are they haunted 
well there s not many people
who say that it s haunted     
      but there was this old woman 
mary brown  who     
mary brown 
yeah  and she was kind of crazy 
how was she seen by the community 
crazy 
there s the american flag 
it s mary s house 
i m gonna bring her out 
you look for the best light  okay 
okay 
this is mary s gate 
i m not even sure how to open it 
and something interesting
happened to you once     
you met the blair witch 
yes 
that is really     
      kind of a scary story 
to make ends meet     
      my dad and i
      used to fish at tappy s creek 
in burkittsville 
i was laying on the leaves     
     watching my pole  and
looking at the sky     
     and suddenly i felt
something near me     
      an eerie feeling     
      it was a woman     
     only on her
arms and hands     
     and everything     
     she had hair      
     dark  almost black hair     
     iike a horse     
     iike a fur  horse fur 
then on her arm     
     she had a shawl     
and she scared you 
or threatened you 
she didn t say anything 
she just stared     
     and then she opened her shawl     
what was under there 
she had hair on her
body like a horse 
hairy from head to toe 
yeah  and her legs     
 how about her face 
 you could see she was a female 
she was just strange looking 
thank god she s
not in the film business 
she thinks she is 
she also says she s a ballerina 
get out 
and she says she s a historian     
i heard that 
     and that she s a scientist
at the department of energy 
i fucked up on mary
with the depth of field 
you measured it in meters 
we re not in europe 
the fucking lens
has meters on it 
it also has our system 
nah  it has meters  look 
but it s an american camera 
all those are meters 
what about the brown ones 
they re feet 
the brown ones are on there  right 
yeah  but the white
ones are obvious 
 didn t you use this camera before 
 yeah  once before 
how was today  guys 
i learned a lot  man 
about mary brown

hello  welcome to day two 
the trail is along here 
it should be pretty obvious 
you guys heard of
the blair witch 
i heard the myth  i don t
really believe much in it 
the myth 
that s all i think it is 
what d you say  sir 
 i said damn fool kids never learn 
 shut up 
damn fool kids never learn 
that s what i said 
why do you say that 
first of all  can i
have your permission     
     to use your image on a
video documentary 
i don t care about that  but     
you have to say yes or no  sir 
 watch it 
 i m sorry 
yeah  sure  okay 
some girl  in the late 1 800 s     
      robin weaver  i
believe her name was       
     supposedly wandered
off into the woods 
no  supposedly  about it 
she wandered off 
 okay  wandered off 
 and got lost 
she got lost 
wasn t no  supposedly  
three days later     
     she appears back on her
grandmother s porch 
and everybody s mystified 
 she was babbling something     
 her story 
babbling something about     
     an old woman whose feet
never touched the ground 
i saw    just by that
tree up the creek     
      about a hundred yards 
i saw a white misty thing 
can t tell you what it was 
like grey vapor rising
out of the trees 
right out of the water 
right out of the water 
up the side of the trees 
then it disappeared 
you re full of it 
i m not  and i wasn t
drinking that day  either 
sure you weren t 
how is that related to the
story of coffin rock 
it all ties in to the
story of coffin rock 
how s that 
anybody round here     
      knows that the old woman has
haunted this area for years 
that s bullshit 
these woods are thick 
you excited 
you got it 
i hope he s not shooting a
whole shitload of stock 
i could help  but i d
rather record 
okay 
packs on  we re ready to go 
we gotta go up to the shack 
yeah 
my god  this is a very heavy pack 
off to coffin rock 
i know exactly where we are now 
mikey  give me the video camera 
i wanna get her going across  man 
i see a dirty behind 
good jump 
thank you 
there it is  see 
that s coffin rock 
 they went into the woods
ready to find death     
      but what they found
was inhumane     
     at the site called coffin rock 
      up on the rock  the torture     
     suffered by these five
brave men was obvious     
     they were tied up  one man s
hands tied to the next man s feet     
     forming a solid
human structure     
      blood indicated that
it had happened     
     while they were
alive and resisting     
     their intestines had been
crudely torn out     
     and on each of their faces there
was indecipherable writing     
     cut into their flesh
with precision     
     the men  shocked by
what had happened     
     went to find the sheriff     
     without sketching the writing
or touching the bodies      
     they returned to see
vultures at the rock 
but the bodies had been
removed by persons unknown     
     the stench of death
was still thick     
      but the bodies had been
taken in a matter of hours      
that happened here
at coffin rock 
let s rush  because i want
to camp  and it s 4 52 
it s late  we re gonna be
losing light soon 
but i can use the shot
without me in it     
      because i recorded sound
while reading the whole thing       
      so i m sure i can edit
it together somehow 
it s starting to rain 
did you rent this thing 
yeah  i don t have a
tent for three people 
just wondering     
i don t usually travel with two men 
it is pouring with rain 
can t even light a fire 
show us what the stick is for 
look  we ve got our
very own leaning post 
if it smells of farts
too much in the night     
okay  so i can t have a
cigarette in the tent       
      but he can fart as
much as he wants 
no  i never gave mike
a fart allowance 
you heard noises last night 
 i did 
 problem is  i sleep like a log 
there were two separate noises     
     coming from two
areas over here     
     one of them could
have been an owl     
      but the other was a cackling 
no way 
it was a cackling  man 
if i heard a cackling 
i would ve shit myself 
where did we start yesterday 
off the map 
i knew where we were going 
there was some confusion  but today   
wait        say that again 
i said i knew where
we were going 
wait       was that a
full of shit statement 
no  it wasn t 
 so that wasn t bullshit 
 i knew where we were going 
you got us lost  man

pile of rocks 
she was talking
about her rocks  man

     seven 
years ago witches
were roasted     
     just like my vienna sausage 
flames are licking you
like the devil  josh 
sit back and hear a tale 
a tale of a fateful trip   
   that started on
this desert isle   
   aboard this tiny ship   
yeah  but this ship
has a good captain     
      not a beer guzzling
guy in a blue shirt 
he wasn t beer guzzling 
they had no beer on
the island  man 
if they had beer  they d
have had big ass orgies 
you re like the captain 
and mike s your gilligan 
 no offense 
 that s all right 
it was a compliment     
     gilligan was a funny guy     
     the captain was fat  though 
well okay  let s call
it a thin captain 
it s not captain     
it s the skipper 
no more captain 
here we are back at
the rock again     
     the cemetery deal 
i just wanna be careful
not to get in the shot 
it certainly is odd 
please tell me you didn t
just knock that over 
i didn t just knock that over 
that s not very nice 
let me put it back 
you can t be too careful 
what d you think 
it was the same  only darker

or whatever 
i don t know what

route to get back     
      because we went
around in a curve 
two more hours max  guys

      between three piles of rocks
just by coincidence

i really don t care     
      because all i want to do
is get to the goddam car 
whatever it is
