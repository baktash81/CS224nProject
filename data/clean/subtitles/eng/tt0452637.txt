they spoke of the future
man listened and it became real
but man does not listen very well
mans need to own everything
led him deeper into land
the magic world of the ones
that live in the ocean
and the world of men
separated
through the centuries their world
and all the inhabitants of it
stopped trying
the world of man became more violent
war upon war played out
as there were no guides to listen to
now those in the water
are trying again
trying to reach us
a handful of their precious young ones
have been sent into the world of man
they are brought in the dead of night
to where man lives
they need only be glimpsed
and the awakening of man
will happen
but their enemies roam the land
there are laws that are meant
to keep the young ones safe
but they are sent
at great risk to their lives
many
do not return
yet still they try
try to help man
but man may have
forgotten how to listen
my daughter says to be careful
mr heep
well its some kind
of a b b b bug

at the same time the us military
will be fighting a propaganda war
if there were a silver bullet

she got sick in the stairwell downstairs

under his shirt
blimblam
mr heep is a player
i hope its all right
its fine

she can stay here
as long as she needs to
you started writing again
yeah
ill be right back okay
hello m mrs choi
is youngsoon at home
no home
great unbelievable
hey hey
thanks
yeah hello
mr heep
where are you
at a club
dont tell my mother
she thinks im at a dance class
okay
what happens if a narf gets scratched
i dont know
put my mother on ill ask her
mrs mrs choi mrs
hey
hey thank you
oh she she she
she doesnt look happy
she said the story
her grandmother told
said a scrunt has poison
that kill narfs
but she said
narfs can protect themselves
they are given a mud called kii
that cures them
they keep it where they live
okay okay
all right now you said that the eagle
comes to take them back
right
now what stops this green thing
from attacking them
when the eagle comes
youre funny mr heep
yeah i know
you really thought about this
put my mom on
hey
yeah hey im sorry
yes
she said only a rogue scrunt
will break the law of that night
because most scrunts are afraid
afraid of what
tartutic they are the law keepers
in this bedtime story
her grandmother said
there are three of them
but they are called one name
tartutic
they live in the trees
they are said to look like monkeys
no one knows for sure because
no one who has seen them has lived
the legend says
that they were born so evil
that they killed their parents
on the night they were born
the fear of them has kept justice
in the blue world for centuries
bye mr heep
thanks
they are given a mud called kii
that cures them
they keep it where they live
my mom figured out i was at a club
she made me come home
she tell me more of the story
why you wet
thats apartment business
listen mr heep
my mother thinks of you as stranger
you have to make her
see you as a child innocent
then she will tell you the bedtime story
there is a reason
the rules might be broken
a thousand narfs is about a rare narf
who comes once
in a generation of narfs
who is called the madam narf
her vessel is important
this vessel will cause change
but it is the madam narf herself
that is truly the key
shes considered
a queen to her people
her return will be seen
as a great inspiration
a scrunt will do anything
to kill a madam narf
even forget his fears of the tartutic
he might break the rules for that
mr heep
will she know
that shes a madam narf
no that is moral of bedtime story
no one is ever told who they are
i think we are linked
its more than just a story to me too
i actually want to believe it
goodbye mr heep
you have saved my life again
you made that room
the cracks that i saw is that room
supposed to collapse eventually
im not allowed to speak
of the blue world
well the door needs a little work
i noticed that you took things
from the apartment
that people left around the pool
thats how i saw you
you were taking something off of a chair
i think i might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad
why did he break the rules tonight
as it turns out
i think that youre someone
very important to everyone
i tried to tell them about you
i dont know if i did the right thing
im not sure how theyre gonna react
i trust you
i believe you are here to protect me
is the kii working
yes thank you
if it is true that i am
he will keep coming after me
i will not be safe until
until tartutic comes
my mother said she saw a ghost once
in the basement
i was the only one who believed her
shes not an apparition anna
i dont know who you are
but you did something to me
my thoughts
everything became clearer
the fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away
i can hear myself
do you wish to know your future
a boy in the midwest of this land
will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often
he will grow up
with these ideas in his head
he will grow into a great orator
he will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land
and throughout the world
this boy will become
leader of this country
and begin a movement
of great change
he will speak of you and your words
your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts
it will be the seeds of change
the cookbook
one two three
oh jeez
could you tell her that i was interested
in hearing more of the story
tell her its a beautiful story
are there are there any parts
that might be good to hear
how is she
the medicines helping her
i told her to stay under the shower
she does better with water
i need to talk with her
and vick should be there too
i told them to wait right outside
ill tell them what you have to say
tell her i know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world
but maybe i could ask some questions
and she can just say if its right or wrong
know what i did when i was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble
my mom always wanted to know
what happened
but i was like
i cant tell on my friends
so she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking
she would say touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes
so i would and then
she would know certain things
but i didnt really feel
like i told on my friends
it was cheating i know
but made me feel better
were ready
so in this bedtime story
the narf has come
to a preordained place
she must leave from the same spot
this eagle the great eatlon
coming to take her back
is really very important
and heres the good stuff
there are humans
with powers that can help her
and these people
have been unconsciously drawn
to live near the vessel
now these humans
dont know who they are
and they always
appear in the story earlier
are there humans with powers
that can help you
but dont know who they are
thats a yes
theyve got weird names
a symbolist a guardian and a guild
ask her if thats right
you want something
one of them vick
mr heep mr heep is one of them
which one guild guardian
she thinks mr heep is the guardian
i was told that theres a symbolist
an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms
he will interpret messages
from the universe
if problems should arise
do you know who the symbolist
or interpreter is
thats a no
and i was told that there is a guild
whose many hands
will combine to help
does she know who they are
there is a guild or something
theyre supposed to help
with their hands
thats another no
all right theres one other
i dont know if its worth mentioning
its not in the stories all the time
its a human usually a female
so full of hope
that they can awaken
the life force in all things
now that one is called the healer
and you can tell
that theyre in the story
because butterflies
are drawn to the healer
butterflies
the last ones a healer
you dont know
any of these people do you
reading a book
learning
she thinks it has to be learned
is the eagle
going to come back for her
only one last time
mr heep
you know the people in this building
you have to find them
what is it
you know these walls are paperthin
i can hear all that bloody noise downstairs
like they were in my kitchen
can you do anything about that
of course not
what is it you want anyway
well i had a question
youre an expert on p p plots right
you know whos gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning yes
there is no originality left in the world
mr heep
that is a sad fact ive come to live with
well if there was a mystery
and a guy had to figure out
who some people were
like he had to find a symbol guy
someone who can
figure out messages
and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group
how would you figure that out
the symbol person should be simple
look for any character
who is doing something mundane
but required analysis
someone who was skilled at puzzles
joey you cant have cereal for lunch
this picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy
i feel sad like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school
joey mr heep appears disquieted
can you give us a moment alone
sure dad
as for the guild
look for any group of characters
that are always seen together
and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue
that seems to regurgitate forever
and you just sit around
and talk about nothing
oh we talk about serious issues
on occasion
we talked about martin luther king
at the tequila hut tuesday night
you talked about that
this is the writers way
of establishing characters
who will be important
further in the story
is there anything further
i can assist you with during my naptime
no no mr farber thank you
story these young men are the guild
and mr dury mr dury
mr dury is the interpreter
and theres one other person
mrs bell could you come in here please
this is mrs bell the healer
story wants to go home and she cant
tomorrow night is her last chance
mr dury please step forward
mr heep youre not stuttering
yes i know i know its only around her
now the interpreter will tell us what to do
if something should go wrong
he will use an instrument
specific to him
to interpret
try it mr dury
i dont
lets just see what happens
i think that theres
a message in there for us
well nine letters across
is the word essential
and it touches
27 down which is scheme
essential scheme
yes
now those were the first two words
that i deciphered in this puzzle
and i thought that was
well i thought that was weird
theres a word that seems
out of place to me
yes
its a sixletter word for gettogether
soiree
soiree
soiree could mean party how could a
how does a party help us
well i guess i thought that you know
a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal
and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell
why is everyone staring at me
go on go on mr dury go on
humans have a pungent smell
to animals
so i thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him
and he wouldnt be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us
does that sound right
hes hearing the voice of god
through a crossword puzzle
were just playing here right
no wait wait
see i dont think that the great eatlon
will land in the presence
of beings not from its world
she didnt want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time
thats before she knew
that i was the guardian
would i be able to watch now
but there will be
therell be hundreds of people at a party
it wont work it wont work see if
theres anything else in there mr dury
this word did give me great difficulty
and then it came to me
sonorous
sonorous sonorous
it could mean music a band
maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band
and we who are of the world
stay with her
to help her with that thing and
until shes taken
hes a prophet
were all just seeing what we want to
i just made all that up
no i think that it worked
i think that it worked
that is why theyre the guild
i think theyre supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party
is he serious
were gonna throw a party
huge party we are serious
tell them
anything you can do for us
all right tables
we definitely need a band its like
the most important thing oh my god
you dont think this is gonna work
do you
im nervous too
you being out there tomorrow night
me not knowing what to do
as the guardian
think i can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you
get a little practice with him
scare him maybe
show him whos boss
i know you wanna get home
you will need a mirror
can you hear me im here
peer over your shoulder carefully
it is only through a mirror that one
can see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass
it will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness
yeah i i dont i
wait
i see him
the guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack
he is a great weapon against him
you should walk backwards
towards him
when you are close enough
to be certain of his position
turn and face the hidden scrunt
im facing him
i am scared
it is about to get very dangerous
okay
im ready
you must invoke the ancient words
nef ra mora
it is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight
what is happening
hes rising out of the grass
his legs are bending and coiling
underneath him
oh my god oh my oh no
hes standing in front of me
the guardian can hypnotize a scrunt
if the guardian looks directly
into the scrunts eyes
it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards
what is the jg scrunts reaction
is he frightened
im not sure
look into his eyes
i am
is he moving away
no
the guardian can control his mind
the jg scrunt will not
be able to attack
okay
you must look into his eyes
i think somethings wrong
hes stepping forward
hes stepping forward
somethings wrong
cleveland run
what is it you are doing
hey there
anything i can do for you there
mr f f f farber
no
so how was the m movie
sucked
oh what a what a shame
characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud
who does that
and a typical romance
where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain
why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies
well maybe
maybe its a metaphor for purification
starting new
no its not
are you okay
hell choose to move
only when no one is looking
theyre masters of hiding
a scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment
if a tenant hadnt walked by
id have been eaten alive
i had no powers over him
you are not the guardian
i do not understand
i cannot protect you
where are the tartutic
why isnt he being punished
where is the justice
how come you dont ask
about bedtime story anymore
ive been busy
you you coming to the party tonight
i have to study
bye mr heep
mr leeds
did you hear about the p party
you coming
a picture here
of the enemy theyre
does man deserve to be saved
mr heep
what
man
yes
thats not the answer i expected
whyd you a ask me that
i know about your family
i looked you up
when you started working here
i know someone killed them
but you cant give up
you cant hide here son
i know
you dont wanna become like me
by the way your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guys name on it
theres something strange going on
around this building
dont think i havent noticed
it is finished
you can see things in the future
some things
i have a question to ask you
i will do my best to answer it
youll tell me the truth right
yes
change doesnt happen the way
you say its gonna happen
without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking
i wrote this thing
it might take decades or longer
to create a reaction
before it anchors
in the consciousness
thats not the type of change
youre telling me is gonna happen right
i was wondering
why he didnt meet me
this leader whos just a boy
if he was so inspired by my words
why didnt he try to meet me
theres a lot of things in the cookbook
people wont like to hear
im not anything you know
i dont think im anything special
so i started thinking
how is this gonna happen
why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously
and why didnt he meet me
and i thought of how it could happen
story i wanted to ask you
is something gonna happen to me
is someone gonna kill me
because i write this
yes
man thinks theyre each alone
in this world
it is not true
you are all connected
one act can one day affect all
what are you guys whispering about
is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids hes gonna have
i told him eight all bratty boys
i asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf dumb and blind guy
thats gonna marry you
very funny herb
okay
dont tell my sister
hi im mr farber
i wanted to thank you
i was completely surprised by all of this
i was expecting some kind of greeting
of course
but this is beyond my expectations
im 13b
oh yeah how you doing whats up
oh yeah good for you
i know of your future cleveland
do you wanna hear it
no
tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back
it is only what i have been told
by others
they tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path
that the universe will give us signs
the tartutic could have not come yet
i can still sense
the scrunts presence near
you have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow
i dont know why im the madam narf
im not special im clumsy
they make fun of me
i dont know how to lead
do you get sick
every time you break a rule
every time that you tell me
something that you shouldnt
theres a storm coming
i am scared
its okay to be scared
i do not have courage
i do not want to be a madam narf
you do what you think is right
you are very brave
you were always meant to lead story
cleveland
the great eatlon is coming
okay
im glad you read my journal
dont worry were all watching you
oh come on
the music should have started already
do not leave this spot
yo come on
hey
find a mirror
why hasnt the m music started
its been working smooth
weve been playing with it all night
you used up the battery
wave to him
they told her that the universe
would line up
and reveal that were
on the right p path
why isnt this working
okay
sometimes animals just look dead
something went wrong
they took her inside up by the pool
it is not time for you to go
it is not time for you to go
isnt this supposed to work
fourteen across
no no
i dont know
i dont know
this world is about finding
your purpose right
and the only way to do that
is to find your own voice you told us that
i dont feel like an interpreter
is it possible that that isnt my purpose
i mean i dont see anything
in these words and i didnt before
and finding ones purpose
is a profound thing
sometimes it isnt always
what it seems
what if these young men
are not the guild
look at what happened at the party
these things havent seemed right
from the beginning
why are you so certain that i am
the interpreter and they are the guild
he was so sure
what
i
asked someone
he acted like he knew
what kind of person
would be so arrogant
to presume to know the intention
of another human being
who put this young girls life
in jeopardy
hello
is the bathroom on this level working
a dog inside the building
go shoo
why youre not a dog at all
my god
this is like a moment
from a horror movie
it is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast
will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character
but in stories where there
has been no prior cursing nudity
killing or death
such as in a family film
the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter
and be referenced again
later in the story
having learned valuable lessons
he may even be given
a humorous moment
to allow the audience
to feel good about him
this is where i turn to run
you will leap for me
i will shut the door
and you will land
a fraction of a second too late
why would they lie to her
about tartutic
these cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives
this has gotta be about faith
her world works by different rules
than ours she may not be dead
we need to be told what to do
we need to find the interpreter
how are we suddenly
going to realize someones purpose
this is someone doing something ancient
an ancient thing in modern times
it could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane
sees the voice of god
in the ordinary
he is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary
does anyone have any idea
who this is
my god
i do
there is a message
there is a ceremony to be done
youre doing great joey
the hands of the guild will be needed
plus two others
joey who is the guild
it is a ceremony of seven sisters
sisters the guild is women
they will touch together
with their hearts as one
to bring strength to the moment
nice joey
you will need a man
who has no secrets
and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses
all must hurry
this will all be over in moments
mr perez de la torre

f f f f five daughters

playing makebelieve
i wanted to believe more than most

than this awfulness around us
but at some point we have to stop
mr leeds it is time to prove
some stories are real
i read it wrong
it was my first time
i thought it said she will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment
i looked at it again it says he
he will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment
