they spoke of the future 
man listened and it became real 
but man does not listen very well 
man s need to own everything
led him deeper into land 
the magic world of the ones
that live in the ocean   
    and the world of men   
    separated 
through the centuries  their world 
and all the inhabitants of it   
    stopped trying 
the world of man became more violent 
war upon war played out 
as there were no guides to listen to 
now those in the water
are trying again   
    trying to reach us 
a handful of their precious young ones
have been sent into the world of man 
they are brought in the dead of night   
    to where man lives 
they need only be glimpsed   
    and the awakening of man
will happen 
but their enemies roam the land 
there are laws that are meant
to keep the young ones safe   
    but they are sent
at great risk to their lives 
many   
    do not return 
yet still they try   
    try to help man 
but man may have
forgotten how to listen

thank you

as long as she needs to 
you started writing again 
yeah 
i ll be right back  okay 
hello  m    mrs  choi 
is young soon at home 
no home 
great  unbelievable 
hey  hey 
thanks 
  yeah  hello 
  mr  heep 
  where are you 
  at a club 
don t tell my mother 
she thinks i m at a dance class 
okay 
what happens if a narf gets scratched 
i don t know 
put my mother on  i ll ask her 
mrs    mrs  choi  mrs   
  hey 
  hey  thank you 
oh  she    she    she   
she doesn t look happy 
she said the story
her grandmother told   
    said a scrunt has poison
that kill narfs 
but she said
narfs can protect themselves 
they are given a mud called kii
that cures them 
they keep it where they live 
okay  okay 
all right  now  you said that the eagle
comes to take them back 
right 
now  what stops this green thing   
   from attacking them
when the eagle comes 
you re funny  mr  heep 
  yeah  i know 
  you really thought about this 
put my mom on 
  hey 
  yeah  hey  i m sorry 
yes 
she said only a rogue scrunt
will break the law of that night   
    because most scrunts are afraid 
afraid of what 
tartutic  they are the law keepers
in this bedtime story 
her grandmother said
there are three of them   
    but they are called one name 
tartutic 
they live in the trees 
they are said to look like monkeys 
no one knows for sure because
no one who has seen them has lived 
the legend says
that they were born so evil   
    that they killed their parents
on the night they were born 
the fear of them has kept justice
in the blue world for centuries 
bye  mr  heep 
thanks 
they are given a mud called kii
that cures them 
they keep it where they live 
my mom figured out i was at a club 
she made me come home 
she tell me more of the story 
  why you wet 
  that s    apartment business 
listen  mr  heep 
my mother thinks of you as stranger 
you have to make her
see you as a child  innocent 
then she will tell you the bedtime story 
there is a reason
the rules might be broken 
a thousand narfs is about a rare narf   
   who comes once
in a generation of narfs   
   who is called the madam narf 
her vessel is important 
this vessel will cause change 
but it is the madam narf herself
that is truly the key 
she s considered
a queen to her people 
her return will be seen
as a great inspiration 
a scrunt will do anything
to kill a madam narf   
   even forget his fears of the tartutic 
he might break the rules for that 
mr  heep 
will she know
that she s a madam narf 
no  that is moral of bedtime story 
no one is ever told who they are 
i think we are linked 
it s more than just a story to me too 
i actually want to believe it 
goodbye  mr  heep 
you have saved my life again 
you made that room 
the cracks that i saw  is that room
supposed to collapse eventually 
i m not allowed to speak
of the blue world 
well  the door needs a little work 
i noticed that you took things
from the apartment   
   that people left around the pool 
that s how i saw you 
you were taking something off of a chair 
i think i might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad 
why did he break the rules tonight 
as it turns out 
i think that you re someone   
   very important to everyone 
i tried to tell them about you 
i don t know if i did the right thing 
i m not sure how they re gonna react 
i trust you 
i believe you are here to protect me 
is the kii working 
yes  thank you 
if it is true that i am   
he will keep coming after me 
i will not be safe until   
until tartutic comes 
my mother said she saw a ghost once 
in the basement 
i was the only one who believed her 
she s not an apparition  anna 
i don t know who you are   
   but you did something to me 
my thoughts 
everything became clearer 
the fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away 
i can hear myself 
do you wish to know your future 
a boy in the midwest of this land   
   will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often 
he will grow up
with these ideas in his head 
he will grow into a great orator 
he will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land   
   and throughout the world 
this boy will become
leader of this country   
   and begin a movement
of great change 
he will speak of you and your words 
your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts 
it will be the seeds of change 
the cookbook 
one  two  three 
oh  jeez 
could you tell her that i was interested
in hearing more of the story 
tell her it s a beautiful story 
are there    are there any parts
that might be good to hear 
  how is she 
  the medicine s helping her 
i told her to stay under the shower 
she does better with water 
i need to talk with her 
and vick should be there too 
i told them to wait right outside 
i ll tell them what you have to say 
tell her i know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world   
   but maybe i could ask some questions 
and she can just say if it s right or wrong 
know what i did when i was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble 
my mom always wanted to know
what happened   
   but i was like 
 i can t tell on my friends  
so she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking 
she would say   touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes  
so i would  and then
she would know certain things   
   but i didn t really feel
like i told on my friends 
it was cheating  i know 
but made me feel better 
we re ready 
so in this bedtime story   
   the narf has come
to a preordained place 
she must leave from the same spot 
this eagle  the great eatlon 
coming to take her back   
   is really very important 
and here s the good stuff 
there are humans
with powers that can help her 
and these people
have been unconsciously drawn   
   to live near the vessel 
now  these humans
don t know who they are   
   and they always
appear in the story earlier 
are there humans with powers
that can help you   
   but don t know who they are 
that s a yes 
they ve got weird names 
a symbolist  a guardian and a guild 
ask her if that s right 
you want something 
one of them  vick 
mr  heep  mr  heep is one of them 
which one  guild  guardian 
she thinks mr  heep is the guardian 
i was told that there s a symbolist   
   an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms 
he will interpret messages   
   from the universe
if problems should arise 
do you know who the symbolist
or interpreter is 
that s a no 
and i was told that there is a guild   
   whose many hands
will combine to help 
does she know who they are 
there is a guild or something 
they re supposed to help
with their hands 
that s another no 
all right  there s one other 
i don t know if it s worth mentioning 
it s not in the stories all the time 
it s a human  usually a female   
   so full of hope   
   that they can awaken
the life force in all things 
now  that one is called the healer 
and you can tell
that they re in the story   
   because butterflies
are drawn to the healer 
  butterflies 
  the last one s a healer 
you don t know
any of these people  do you 
reading  a book 
learning 
she thinks it has to be learned 
is the eagle
going to come back for her 
only one last time 
mr  heep 
you know the people in this building 
you have to find them 
what is it 
you know these walls are paper thin 
i can hear all that bloody noise downstairs
like they were in my kitchen 
can you do anything about that 
of course not 
  what is it you want  anyway 
  well  i had a question 
you re an expert on p    p    plots  right 
you know who s gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning  yes 
there is no originality left in the world 
mr  heep 
that is a sad fact i ve come to live with 
well  if there was a mystery   
   and a guy had to figure out
who some people were   
   like he had to find a symbol guy   
   someone who can
figure out messages   
   and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group 
how would you figure that out 
the symbol person should be simple 
look for any character
who is doing something mundane   
   but required analysis 
someone who was skilled at puzzles 
joey  you can t have cereal for lunch 
this picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy 
i feel sad  like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school 
joey  mr  heep appears disquieted 
can you give us a moment alone 
sure  dad 
as for the guild   
   look for any group of characters
that are always seen together   
   and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue   
   that seems to regurgitate forever 
and you just sit around
and talk about nothing 
oh  we talk about serious issues 
on occasion 
we talked about martin luther king
at the tequila hut tuesday night 
you talked about that 
this is the writer s way
of establishing characters   
    who will be important
further in the story 
is there anything further
i can assist you with during my naptime 
no  no  mr  farber  thank you 
story  these young men are the guild 
and mr  dury    mr  dury 
mr  dury is the interpreter 
and there s one other person 
mrs  bell  could you come in here  please 
this is mrs  bell  the healer 
story wants to go home and she can t 
tomorrow night is her last chance 
mr  dury  please step forward 
  mr  heep  you re not stuttering 
  yes  i know  i know  it s only around her 
now  the interpreter will tell us what to do
if something should go wrong 
he will use an instrument
specific to him   
   to interpret 
  try it  mr  dury 
  i don t   
let s just see what happens 
i think that there s
a message in there for us 
well  nine letters across
is the word  essential  
and it touches   
   27 down  which is  scheme  
  essential scheme 
  yes 
now  those were the first two words
that i deciphered in this puzzle   
   and i thought that was   
well  i thought that was weird 
there s a word that seems
out of place to me 
  yes 
  it s a six letter word for  get together  
   soiree  
  soiree 
soiree could mean  party   how could a    
how does a party help us 
well  i guess i thought that  you know   
   a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal   
   and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell 
  why is everyone staring at me 
  go on  go on  mr  dury  go on 
humans have a pungent smell
to animals   
   so i thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him   
   and he wouldn t be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us 
does that sound right 
he s hearing the voice of god
through a crossword puzzle 
  we re just playing here  right 
  no  wait  wait 
see  i don t think that the great eatlon   
   will land in the presence
of beings not from its world 
she didn t want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time 
that s before she knew
that i was the guardian 
would i be able to watch now 
but there will be   
there ll be hundreds of people at a party 
it won t work  it won t work  see if
there s anything else in there  mr  dury 
this word did give me great difficulty 
and then it came to me 
   sonorous  
  sonorous  sonorous 
it could mean music  a band 
maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band   
   and we who are of the world
stay with her   
   to help her with that thing and   
until she s taken 
he s a prophet 
we re all just seeing what we want to 
i just made all that up 
no  i think that it worked 
i think that it worked 
that is why they re the guild 
i think they re supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party 
  is he serious 
  we re gonna throw a party 
  huge party  we are serious 
  tell them   
anything you can do for us 
all right  tables   
we definitely need a band  it s like
the most important thing  oh  my god 
you don t think this is gonna work 
do you 
i m nervous too 
you being out there tomorrow night 
me not knowing what to do
as the guardian 
think i can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you 
get a little practice with him 
scare him  maybe 
show him who s boss 
i know you wanna get home 
you will need a mirror 
can you hear me  i m here 
peer over your shoulder carefully 
it is only through a mirror that one
can see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass 
it will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness 
yeah  i    i don t    i   
wait 
i see him 
the guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack 
he is a great weapon against him 
you should walk backwards
towards him 
when you are close enough
to be certain of his position   
   turn and face the hidden scrunt 
i m facing him 
i am scared 
it is about to get very dangerous 
okay 
i m ready 
you must invoke the ancient words
 nef ra mora  
it is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight 
what is happening 
he s rising out of the grass 
his legs are bending and coiling   
   underneath him 
oh  my god  oh  my    oh  no 
he s standing in front of me 
the guardian can hypnotize a scrunt 
if the guardian looks directly
into the scrunt s eyes   
   it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards 
what is the j g  scrunt s reaction 
is he frightened 
i m not sure 
  look into his eyes 
  i am 
  is he moving away 
  no 
the guardian can control his mind 
the j g  scrunt will not
be able to attack 
  okay 
  you must look into his eyes 
i think something s wrong 
he s stepping forward 
he s stepping forward 
something s wrong 
cleveland  run 
what is it you are doing 
hey there 
anything i can do for you there 
mr  f    f    f    farber 
no 
so how was the m    movie 
  sucked 
  oh  what a    what a shame 
characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud 
who does that 
and a typical romance   
   where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain 
why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies 
well  maybe   
maybe it s a metaphor for purification 
starting new 
no  it s not 
are you okay 
he ll choose to move
only when no one is looking 
they re masters of hiding 
a scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment 
if a tenant hadn t walked by   
   i d have been eaten alive 
i had no powers over him 
you are not the guardian 
i do not understand 
i cannot protect you 
where are the tartutic 
why isn t he being punished 
where is the justice 
how come you don t ask
about bedtime story anymore 
i ve been busy 
you    you coming to the party tonight 
i have to study 
bye  mr  heep 
mr  leeds 
did you hear about the p    party 
you coming 
  a picture here
of the enemy they re   
does man deserve to be saved 
mr  heep 
  what 
  man 
yes 
that s not the answer i expected 
why d you a    ask me that 
i know about your family 
i looked you up
when you started working here 
i know someone killed them 
but you can t give up 
you can t hide here  son 
i know 
you don t wanna become like me 
by the way  your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy s name on it 
there s something strange going on
around this building 
don t think i haven t noticed 
it is finished 
you can see things in the future 
some things 
i have a question to ask you 
i will do my best to answer it 
you ll tell me the truth  right 
yes 
change doesn t happen the way
you say it s gonna happen   
   without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking 
i wrote this thing 
it might take decades or longer
to create a reaction   
   before it anchors
in the consciousness 
that s not the type of change
you re telling me is gonna happen  right 
i was wondering
why he didn t meet me   
   this leader who s just a boy 
if he was so inspired by my words 
why didn t he try to meet me 
there s a lot of things in the cookbook
people won t like to hear 
i m not anything  you know 
i don t think i m anything special 
so i started thinking 
 how is this gonna happen 
why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously 
and why didn t he meet me  
and i thought of how it could happen 
story  i wanted to ask you 
is something gonna happen to me 
is someone gonna kill me
because i write this 
yes 
man thinks they re each alone
in this world 
it is not true 
you are all connected 
one act can one day affect all 
what are you guys whispering about 
is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids he s gonna have 
i told him eight  all bratty boys 
i asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf  dumb and blind guy   
   that s gonna marry you 
very funny  herb 
okay 
don t tell my sister 
hi  i m mr  farber 
i wanted to thank you 
i was completely surprised by all of this 
i was expecting some kind of greeting 
of course 
but this is beyond my expectations 
i m 13b 
  oh  yeah  how you doing  what s up 
  oh  yeah  good for you 
i know of your future  cleveland 
do you wanna hear it 
no 
tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back 
it is only what i have been told
by others 
they tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path   
   that the universe will give us signs 
the tartutic could have not come yet 
i can still sense
the scrunt s presence near 
you have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow 
i don t know why i m the madam narf 
i m not special  i m clumsy 
they make fun of me 
i don t know how to lead 
do you get sick
every time you break a rule 
every time that you tell me
something that you shouldn t 
there s a storm coming 
  i am scared 
  it s okay to be scared 
i do not have courage 
i do not want to be a madam narf 
you do what you think is right 
you are very brave 
you were always meant to lead  story 
cleveland   
   the great eatlon is coming 
okay 
i m glad you read my journal 
don t worry  we re all watching you 
oh  come on 
the music should have started already 
do not leave this spot 
  yo  come on 
  hey 
find a mirror 
why hasn t the m    music started 
it s been working smooth 
we ve been playing with it all night 
you used up the battery 
wave to him 
they told her that the universe
would line up   
   and reveal that we re
on the right p    path 
why isn t this working 
okay 
sometimes animals just look dead 
something went wrong 
they took her inside  up by the pool 
it is not time for you to go 
it is not time for you to go 
isn t this supposed to work 
fourteen across 
no  no 
i don t know 
i don t know 
this world is about finding
your purpose  right 
and the only way to do that
is to find your own voice  you told us that 
i don t feel like an interpreter 
is it possible that that isn t my purpose 
i mean  i don t see anything
in these words  and i didn t before 
and finding one s purpose
is a profound thing 
sometimes it isn t always
what it seems 
what if these young men
are not the guild 
look at what happened at the party 
these things haven t seemed right
from the beginning 
why are you so certain that i am
the interpreter and they are the guild 
he was so sure 
what 
i   
   asked someone 
he acted like he knew 
what kind of person
would be so arrogant   
   to presume to know the intention
of another human being 
who put this young girl s life
in jeopardy 
hello 
is the bathroom on this level working 
a dog inside the building 
go  shoo 
why  you re not a dog at all 
my god 
this is like a moment
from a horror movie 
it is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast   
   will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character 
but in stories where there
has been no prior cursing  nudity   
   killing or death 
such as in a family film   
   the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter   
   and be referenced again
later in the story   
   having learned valuable lessons 
he may even be given
a humorous moment   
   to allow the audience
to feel good about him 
this is where i turn to run 
you will leap for me 
i will shut the door 
and you will land
a fraction of a second too late 
why would they lie to her
about tartutic 
these cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives 
this has gotta be about faith 
her world works by different rules
than ours  she may not be dead 
  we need to be told what to do 
  we need to find the interpreter 
how are we suddenly
going to realize someone s purpose 
this is someone doing something ancient 
an ancient thing in modern times 
it could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane 
sees the voice of god
in the ordinary 
he is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary 
does anyone have any idea
who this is 
my god 
i do 
there is a message 
there is a ceremony to be done 
you re doing great  joey 
the hands of the guild will be needed 
plus two others 
joey  who is the guild 
it is a ceremony of seven sisters 
sisters  the guild is women 
they will touch together
with their hearts as one   
   to bring strength to the moment 
nice  joey 
you will need a man
who has no secrets   
   and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses 
all must hurry 
this will all be over in moments 
mr  perez de la torre 
i need to speak with your
f    f    f    f    five daughters 
honey  honey 
there s some people here to see you 
sweetheart 
he s probably rinsing his mouth 
he s got terrible breath 
don t tell him i told you 
  huge explosions
right in the very heart of the capital 
several explosions  i felt at least four
very close to the center of the city 
i think we have everybody 
a man who has no secrets   
   and one whose opinion
i greatly respect 
they will be w    w    witnesses 
will the guild please come forward 
yeah 
and you make seven 
seven sisters 
come  come 
yeah 
everything s right now 
come back to us now 
come back to us now  honey 
come back to us 
i can t believe it 
this is crazy  this woman
is probably dying as we re talking 
she needs to get to a hospital 
this is not right  we can t just stand here
playing make believe 
i wanted to believe more than most 
i wanna be like a child again 
i needed to believe there s more
than this awfulness around us   
   but at some point we have to stop 
mr  leeds  it is time to prove
some stories are real 
i read it wrong 
it was my first time 
i thought it said   she will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters   
   to bring strength to the moment  
i looked at it again  it says  he  
 he will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment  
mrs  bell is not the healer 
it said the healer could be a man 
but i    but i   
i saw a butterfly land right on her 
butterflies 
yeah  the bedtime story
said butterflies are drawn to the healer 
but  mr  heep 
you brought that butterfly to me 
it caught my eye as you walked over 
i did 
wait  no 
you must try 
  there s no time 
  i can t  i can t  i can t 
shut up   
   and try 
say something to bring out your energy 
i m sorry i couldn t protect you 
i should have been there 
i am always gonna regret   
   just not being there 
i ll miss your faces 
oh  they remind me of god 
i m so lost without you guys 
i met this very nice lady 
and her name s story 
and i think you would ve liked her 
i think she might be   
   an angel   
   because she has to go home 
i love you all 
i love you all so much 
thank you for all you have done 
your sister will have seven children 
you will see the first two 
oh  my god  he s the guardian 
reggie
