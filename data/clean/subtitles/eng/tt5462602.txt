um  i ll tell you about myself 
i grew up in pakistan 
and people are always
asking me  what was that like 
really not that different from here 
i mean  we played cricket 
which is just a spicier version of baseball 
and we prayed a lot 
well  not a lot 
just five times a day 
and we marry someone our parents find for us 
arranged marriage  you know 
but for me  it was probably that we got
episodes of knight rider a little bit later 
and by  little bit later  
i mean we just got episode two 
but other than that  it was exactly the same 
so  these are my real journals  honestly 
and this is the woman who wrote them 
poor gal 
yeah 
she she has no idea that  like 
giant titties are about to sprout
and change her life dramatically 
so  uh  thank you guys   
there s no bad crowds  dude  only bad comedians 
you complain about the crowd  like  all the time 
yeah  like  that s when they re really bad 
that s like 90  of the time they re really bad 
look  will you just watch
and give me notes tonight  all right 
if we both give each other
notes  i think it helps 
your notes are just  add more fucks into the bit 
  that doesn t help anybody 
  hey  fuck  fuck s a funny word 
it s soft on the top and it s hard on the end 
that was truly horrible 
  that was so bad 
  what happened 
  just watch 
  i ll watch  i ll give you notes

and we all know what happens
after eight jell o shots

  chris 
  he s like if a serial killer

he s like daniel day lewis  except he sucks 
i ve tried his warm up 
  it does not work for me 
  so unsettling 
just bought a laser printer 
printed out  like  six lasers so far 
  maybe 
  hey  dodd 
uh  dalavan s in the crowd tonight 
  can i do ten 
  no  five minutes 
  you know the deal 
  come on  man 
you put out chairs  you do five minutes 
i ll double it up next time 
come on 
what are you gonna do in there 
  i m making up next week s schedule 
  okay  cool 
i was in bed with my girlfriend
and i was trying to mansplain
to her that  you know 
we we are on one little rock
orbiting one star in a galaxy
of a billion stars in a universe
full of a billion galaxies 
you know  so i forgot your birthday 
who gives a shit 
like  you are cosmically overreacting to this 
honestly  you are being super selfish 
you re right  but you re selfish 
hey 
have you guys heard of this
drug cocktail called cheese 
uh  i saw these news reports 
so i looked up what cheese is 
and cheese is a mixture 
cheese is tylenol pm and heroin 
so  really  it s heroin 
heroin s doing the heavy lifting 
just do the heroin 
it s very powerful 
you already have heroin 
is pakistan in the house 
really 
you re not from pakistan 
i would ve noticed you 
  are you kidding me 
  mm 
he just gave you montreal 
like  you don t have to showcase
  or audition or anything 
  no 
it was too easy  almost 
like  i wanted to struggle 
i wanted  i wanted a story
to be able to tell on talk
shows  and instead  like   
you guys don t know
how tough it is not to struggle 
it s it s a struggle succeeding effortlessly 
did he say anything about me 
sure 
  what about me 
  he  they  both of you 
he said   those guys performed  
i truly hate you  actually 
we all hate you 
  hi 
  hi 
  hello 
  um  my name s kumail 
yeah  we know 
yeah  we saw you perform 
now that the niceties are out of the way  um 
i have to tell you that when you yelled at me 
it really threw me off 
and  uh  you really shouldn t heckle comedians 
it s so rude 
i didn t heckle you 
i just whoo hoo d you 
it s supportive 
  okay  that s a common misconception 
  uh huh 
but yelling anything at a
comedian is considered heckling 
heckling doesn t have to be negative 
so  if i  if i yelled out  like 
 you re amazing in bed  
that d be a heckle 
  yeah  it would be an accurate heckle 
  cool 
whoa  bye

i  uh  had acne and i was a goth  and   
i had this terrible perm 
um  yeah  the kids called me beetlejuice

you don t get that because you made fun of me 
what is happening

we were just having sex 
yeah  but we were  like  in the throes of passion
then  and   
listen  i had a really nice time 
thank you very much 
i m just gonna  like  call an uber  go home 
and i hope   
just   
your driver will be ready as
soon as he puts on his pants 
were you available for rides
while we were fucking 
yeah  but i only looked a couple times 
so  maybe i ll  uh  run
into you at the club sometime
and we can grab a drink

which i won t  cause
you re not dating  i m not dating 
i wouldn t be able to see you till monday 
we haven t hung out for two days

yesterday and today  cause it s after midnight 
so  today is actually tomorrow 
earlier tonight was yesterday 
so two days

so that really takes you off the table 
that works out
 cause i i am
a hard core time nerd 
  yeah  i can tell 
  i m  like  very strict
about a m  p m  stuff and   
so  wait  so just to establish 
what did we decide

no  he did not tell me that 
  do you really 
  oh  it s really nothing 
it s just something i m fiddling around with 
how is a one man show different
  from stand up 
  it s really not 
i guess it s because there s lots of  like 
wigs and costume changes
  and there s a lot of acting in it 
  mm 
and then  like  at the end of it 
you ve got this very awkward
conversation where you go 
 i really liked it  
but i thought you really liked it 
i    really liked it 
i can t wait to see this show 
  oh  yeah 
  okay  you you will never see the show

  it s   
  yeah  no 
  significant 
i m 12 years old and this   
this is home 
feels like i never left 
do you smell that 
that s my mom cooking the murgh rogan josh 
  fuck 
  do you hear that 
that s my father watching cricket on the telly 
do you feel that 
that s the weight of pakistan s history 
pakistan was formed when it separated
from its biggest rival  india 
on august 14  1947 
six runs 
silly mid on  short mid wicket 
mid wicket 
deep mid wicket 
mid on  long on  long off 
bowler  mid off

and you re the only one
with the truth  is that right 
so  the sun is just shining

  she s white 
  oh 
i thought you were gonna say you
were involved in a hit and run
or you got caught forging some checks 
but a white girl  
i mean  that s such a cliché 
it s okay  and we hate terrorists 
  it s   
  just    sorry 
listen  i understand 
you re in america 
and you want to mow a few lawns
and see what it s like 
but eventually you have
to marry a pakistani girl 
like    like  i hung out with other girls 
but then i married fatima 
and we hardly spoke two words to each other
in the first few months 
but now  kumi  she s like my best friend 
  i know 
  you have to break up with her immediately 
if i find someone who s as good
for me as fatima is for you 
mom would understand  right 
i mean  she she wouldn t love me less 
oh  she d definitely love you less 
slowly  it d sort of   
what s the word when guys

  yeah 
why do you know so much about wine 
um  because 
uh   
i was pretty unhappy in my first marriage 
and i drank a lot 
and  uh  one way to cover
drinking a lot is to just 
  like  know a lot about wine 
  wait  i m sorry 
that knowing a lot about wine
covers for drinking a lot 
what did you just say 
uh  no  i mean the huge piece of information
  that you re trying to just blow right past

i m dr  cunningham  emily s attending 
i ll be coordinating all the doctors
and orchestrating her treatment strategy 
all the doctors 
  how many are there 
  five 
  five  why so many  i mean  is that    is that normal 
  yes 
it s standard for patients in the icu 
we come at it from many angles  we confer   
we re assessing her 
we immediately
initiated orotracheal intubation 
thankfully 
  it hasn t affected her heart at this point 
  we don t know
but we got her on a broad
spectrum of antibiotics 
the exact nature of the infection yet 
centering around the costodiaphragmatic recess 
the right lung is battling critical infection
our theory is methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus 
  staphyl    hold on  that s a  p    
  yeah 
  that s an  f  or a ph  
  ph  no  it s staphylococcus   
that was very reassuring  wasn t it 
apparently  there are good and bad comas 
and the kind that they put her in   
the medically induced coma   
are definitely  like 
the good kind of coma 
like    you know how
there are good and bad carbs 
gremlins   
those can be good or bad 
listen  kumail   
uh   
we re gonna handle things from here  okay 
you ve been very helpful 
thank you for   
for signing the thing  and   
yeah  my pleasure 
but  uh  you can go now

all right 
peace in the mideast 
what about this 
i saw a sniffer dog
at the airport 
he had a boner 
does that mean drugs or bombs 
that s good  what if   
what if instead
of it being at the airport 
  you quit comedy  and never do comedy ever again 
  yeah 
fuck you  it s a good bit 
that s a funny bit 
just for the sake of the public
that they wouldn t have to
look at your face or hear your words 
that s   
hey  it s okay that i m not there  right 
like    i don t need to be there  right 
what s up 
what happened 
  he put his girlfriend in a coma  yeah 
  yeah 
you know  the the way you do 
  she s not my girlfriend 
  he didn t  but he signed
a paper that allowed doctors to put   
he    he suggested it 
she s gonna be fine 
she s gonna be fine  they said
she s gonna be fine  so
  they re gonna be fine  doctors know medical stuff 
  you   
  mm hmm 
  that s what doctors do 
they re good at medical stuff 
this is a medically induced coma 
this is their specialty 
you know  it might be a good thing 
like  she might wake up with a new skill 
like  my cousin  uh  blacked out once  and then 
when he came to  he thought
he knew a different language 
  did he 
  no  apparently  it was   
it was just gibberish that he made up 
it was brain damage 
i got another taco bell one 
did you forget something 
  is she up yet 
  no  she s not 
and  uh  they won t tell us anything 
we ve been here all morning 
i know you guys said that
you don t need me to stay 
but i think i m just gonna wait anyway 
you guys broke up 
i m not sure why you re here 
you you don t have to worry
about being committed to anything  kumail 
you didn t want to when she was awake 
there s no need to do it when she s unconscious 
  it s more complicated than that 
  is it 
 cause i know about the two day rule 
i know about the head shots and the secrets 
she tells us everything 
you really don t have to stay  kumail 
  you have already done   
  a lot 
i m just gonna stay for a second

mine s good 
tuna s always a gamble  but 
you know  we re not by the water

whatever 
i i threw the dice 
i got the   
sevens  i guess 
whatever    whatever the good dice number is 
so  uh   
9 11 
no  i mean   
i ve always wanted to have
a conversation with    about it 
with    people 
you ve never talked to people about 9 11 
no  what s your   
what s your stance 
what s my stance on 9 11 
oh  um   
anti  it was a tragedy 
i mean 
we lost 19 of our best guys 
huh 
that was a joke  obviously 
9 11 was a terrible tragedy 
and it s not funny to joke about it 
mr  and mrs  gardner 
please report to the icu 
mr  and mrs  gardner

hello  come in 
please  have a seat 
i know this isn t the news you were hoping for 
but we aren t ready to bring
emily out of the coma yet 
oh 
why  uh  what happened 
the antibiotics aren t doing
what we d hoped they would 
and we don t want to mess around 
so tomorrow morning  we re gonna perform surgery
to remove the infection 
dr  spellman told us
that the antibiotics would work 
  oh  wait one second 
  oh 
  yeah 
  i mean  he didn t say anything at all about surgery 
so what    what does that mean 
surgery  what kind of surgery 
it s called thoracentesis 
it s a very common procedure 
we re gonna go in between the
ribs and remove the infection 
how do you spell that  please 
and what is it  what s the name 
what s the last part 
  thora   
  and the infection i is   
  on the lung 
   thora  what   thora  what 
  what is it 
  and we re going to remove it 
thoracentesis  c e n t e s i s 
  and what s the risk 
  it s a common thing
  that they do

so  do you want to hang out sometime 
like  without our parents

i don t think that s a good idea 
you don t like    cats 
i mean   
i don t think it s a good idea
for us to hang out again 
it s not you 
you re    fantastic 
i just can t do this arranged
marriage thing    with anybody 
so why did you meet me 
it wasn t my idea 
i m just really tired 
do you ever want to just be in a relationship
so you can just finally relax 
i m sorry 
you deserve better than me 
people always telling me what i deserve 
it s bullshit 
and stop being so sorry about everything 
i m gonna go 
and do you know what 
i watched the x files   
like  three whole episodes   
and it s a bad show 
wow 
they should call this web site 
 everything is cancer  dot com  
whatever symptom you put in 
it    could be cancer 
hiccups could be cancer 
come on 
take the fun out of hiccups now 
but you know  this is the
17th best hospital in chicago 
  really  out of how many 
  i don t know 
but northwestern s number one 
how do they rate 
  or what s the methodology 
  i i don t know  terry 
but 17th is bad 
it s not great 
unless the sample size is   
you know  that all depends 
here  look at the comments 
this is why i don t want to go online 
 cause it s never good 
you go online  they hated forrest gump 
frickin  best movie ever 
yeah  i know 
well  it  no  it hasn t been that long 
like  three hours  maybe 
oh  hey  i i   
all right  i got to go 
  terry  hi 
  hey 
  can we talk 
  yeah  yeah 
okay 
we got the biopsy results 
they are  unfortunately  inconclusive 
uh  we re concerned because it is also   
well  wait  wait  what does that mean 
it means it s aggressive 
it means that   
i mean  they they couldn t find out what
the disease was or where the   
where the virus came from 
  the bacteria  whatever 
  but but they took out
  the infection  so it shouldn t matter 
  i know  that s what
i said 
but  uh  her vitals didn t normalize 
and and now they say  the infection 
it s it s continuing to spread 
it s in her kidneys now 
  but the kidneys are so far from the lungs 
  i know 
it s an aggressive infection  and and they said
what they got to do now is
they just got to figure out
  what this mystery disease actually is 
  uh huh  uh huh 
uh huh  uh huh 
uh huh 
i m calling northwestern 
  just hold on  hold on 
  terry  goddamn it   
  i think we should talk about   
  shut up 
i m sick of this shit  terry 
we re getting her out of here 
they re in the middle of the   
of the whole process
  of elimination 
  so you re saying northwestern can t take
that information and continue the search 
this place is a shithole 
i m sorry 
anna  could i have that 
will you just stop for a second 
all right  they are the doctors 
you you act like you know
what you re talking about 
  doctors are not the same 
  you don t 
  you got a phone 
  yeah 
  don t give her the phone 
i can t find my cell phone 
don t   
you don t need a phone 
you don t need to call anybody right now 
the   
they re doing it 
they re the experts here  and   
  and i trust them 
  one  five   
  oh  well  that s very nice 
but i don t  can you unlock
that thing  there there s
a reason they re number 17
and northwestern s number one 
and that s not because people
trust them  thank you 
wait  you think you re smarter
than me  you say big sentences 
okay  well  you re not 
you re not 
i don t think i m smarter than you 
you just don t think you re as smart as i am 
  that s not my fault 
  right  it s   
it s never your fault 
everything s my fault 
oh  there are some things that are definitely   
just your fault 
okay  that s that s bullshit 
you need to stop freaking out and calm down 
and you need to stop being a coward 
right 
the greatest hits coming back 
okay  you can just   
well  you can stop 
i ll i ll replay the rest of this from memory 
yeah  don t    listen to me   
oh  you re giraffe ing it 
it s the biggest thing they had 
i don t even know if she likes giraffes 
we never talked about   
giraffes 
hey  do they know what they re doing 
 cause they don t tell us anything 
like  uh  lyme disease 
you know  the girl
on the real world had it 
did you guys look for that 
  yes  we did 
  you know  she gets hurt all the time 
and she messed up her ankle
recently  could that be lupus 
listen  we re looking into everything 
we re not holding anything back from you 
we re still just eliminating possibilities 
 cause beth wants to move her to northwestern 
no  emily should not be moved 
the hospital will approve it 
because it ll get the liability off their hands 
but we put her in a coma for a reason   
to stabilize her 
moving her could be very dangerous 
trust me  she is fighting this  and so are we 
hey  terry  i i was just talking to the n   
  you okay 
  yeah 
yeah  of course 
fine  totally fine 
just  uh   
beth went to emily s  so  uh   
i m gonna wait here
till they kick me out  you know 
just just keep an eye on her 
do you want to crash at my place 
you got golf channel 
no 
that wasn t funny  right 
oh  i didn t    i thought
that was a serious question 
let s get the fuck out of here 
so   
this is the place 
huh  wow 
this place is terrible 
hey  uh  i talked to nurse judy 
and she was saying that  like 
moving emily could be a bad idea 
really 
yeah  she said it could be dangerous 
like  something   
yeah  i i hear you 
hmm 
i just   
i d give anything just to   
trade places with emily 
you know 
being a parent  it s it s a nightmare 
loving somebody this much sucks 
yeah 
and  uh 
i guess you ve noticed
the tension between beth and me 
uh  not really 
uh  it s none of my business 
  so i don t try to   
  yeah  no  it s   
uh  it s there 
big time 
it s getting really late 
we should go to sleep 
i cheated on her

you know  that that  uh 
moment of clarity you get  right after an orgasm 
yeah 
i told beth right away 
i had to 
she was devastated 
and now she hates me 
she might be mad at you  but

you re gonna know
the woman that you want to spend
the rest of your life with
when you cheat on her 
when you cheat on her
and you just feel like shit 
so to fully know i love someone 
i have to cheat on them 
out loud  it sounds stupid 
eh  it s   
yeah  that s terrible advice 
love   
love isn t easy 
that s why they call it love 
  i don t really get that either 
  i know 
i thought i could just start saying something

oh  come on  come on  come on 
they ll charge us  48 for it 
don t worry about it 
why are you here 
i   i haven t heard her voice in awhile 
he s been  he s been here the whole time 
could i speak with you both    outside 
yeah 
we ll be right back 
  yeah  we ll be right outside 
  all right 
hey 
emily has a rare condition called
adult onset still s disease 
kumail mentioned emily s hurt ankle 
and the swelling still hadn t gone down
even after several days in bed 
  which is strange 
  mm 
still s disease is when the body
thinks healthy tissue
is an infection so it tries to fight it 
  uh huh 
  it s like a big biological misunderstanding 
  yeah  yeah 
  so 
we gave her anti inflammatories
and she stabilized within hours 
she s gonna take time to recover 
but she ll be fine 
  wow 
  full recovery 
what are you doing here 
i was visiting someone down the hall 
and i was  like  i ll just pop in
  and say hi to emily 
  oh 
oh  i m joking 
i m here for you 
you re an asshole  and i don t like you 
i m not an asshole 
i m really not 
  oh  no  you re an asshole 
  you have a lot of drugs in you 
so you re  like  not thinking as clearly 
no  dawg  i m not joking 
you re not funny to me 
you just make me sad 
you make me sad inside of my heart 
and it makes me sad to look at you 
so i think you should probably go 
just go  and tell my mom i want her 
will you please get my mom 
  i m so sorry about that 
  yeah  it s fine  yeah 
um  emily wants to see you 
oh 
um  i m gonna head out 
i don t think i should be here 
uh  kumail  here s the thing 
your living condition  it s  uh   
it s a potential health risk 
and you re not that funny 
but you re probably not suited
to do anything else either 
so that s troublesome 
you really made it sound like you were gonna
say something positive there 
yeah  i guess i did  didn t i 
well  you know   
you know i know the good stuff 
i know the good stuff 
i don t know  so you know   
you know how i feel 
i got to   
  i got to get in 
  yeah 
what d i miss 
what d i miss 
brick on top of the grilled cheese and   
yeah 
yeah  i want that 
  be right back 
  bacon or something   
  hey 
  hey 
so you re gonna hang around chicago for a while 
yeah 
  she s got physical therapy 
  oh 
did you ever think you d be excited
to have your daughter
go through physical therapy 
it s so strange that we could go through
one of the most intense experiences
of our lives together and just   
just never see each other again 
maybe 
but i hope not 
threw a bird at you and then ran away 
and you re  like   oh  crap 
i own a bird now  
hi  little sad man 
mopey boy 
  hey 
  we have something to tell you 
yes  tell him 
  we re moving to new york 
  new york 
  what 
  mm hmm 
and we want you to come with us 
are you serious 
you got to do it 
it s gonna suck at first 
  and maybe we ll eventually get paid to write jokes 
  mm hmm 
but we re gonna have each other 
it s gonna be the best 
come on  dude 
you have to come 
i know you did not
get montreal  and that is only because
you did one of the worst sets i ve ever seen
in my goddamn life 
  yeah 
  it was nonsense 
a living disgrace 
i would call it shit  but i would be worried
that i d be insulting actual shit 
yeah  it was so bone chilling to me 
i thought a ghost had passed right through me 
we don t have to keep going over
how bad the set was 
i saw their faces
and the noises they didn t make 
i felt one of my eggs die 
doesn t that happen  like  every month 
it happens every month  kumail 
but i don t always feel it and go 
  and that s what you made me do 
  yeah 
i m packing my things up 
and i m moving to new york 
and guess what  baby 
you re coming with me 
what about chris 
have you ever seen a pigeon
try and pick up another pigeon 
he will be fine 
there s not enough room in the car  probably 
we leave in a week 
all right 
and i already called shotgun 
chicago to pittsburgh 
do not fuck this up 
your destiny awaits 
this ll be the biggest move of your life 
other than the one from pakistan 
yeah 
i didn t have any kind of epiphany or anything   
hey  clink  clink  clink 
clink  clink 
hey  everybody 
thank you for coming 
i just want to say a couple  uh   
a couple of words here 
mom  why is kumail here 
 cause he was there the whole time  you know 
i invited the nurses  i invited him 
and  um  for   
  i want to say something  i want to say something 
  dad 
emily  come on up  come on up here 
talk amongst yourselves 
this might take a   
emily successfully peeled an orange this morning 
  dad 
  yeah 
it was    it was a clementine 
full disclosure  a clementine 
it s those little ones that  you know 
a baby monkey could peel it 
but  uh  but she did it 
and and yeah  so that s all 
we just   
thank you  everybody 
hey   
hi 
i like your cane 
  i heard pimpin  ain t easy 
  right 
hey  could we talk for a second 
sure 
so i ve been collecting some things  uh 
that are important to me 
and i wanted to show them to you 
i call this my bag of devotion 
uh  so this is  uh  all the visitor passes
from when i visited you when you were in the 
um   
so    these are the tickets
from when your parents came to see me perform 
and  uh  i    i realized how great they are 
and how great you are 
and how great honesty is 
what did you do 
did you cremate someone 
these are the ashes of all the pakistani women   
not the women    the pictures
of the pakistani women 
i thought this was a good idea 
and it feels kind of   
it feels a little stupid 
i know i was a terrible boyfriend   
but i have changed 
and i am the person you need me to be 
i really am 
so   
will you take me back 
kumail  i m really glad that you   
went through this experience   
but you have to understand that
that all happened when i was asleep 
like  you felt one way a few weeks ago 
and now you re saying you feel
the total opposite way 
and the only thing that s changed
is that i was in a coma 
honestly  i i   
i look at all of this  and i just think 
you know  i just can t do it again 
  and i can t   
  i   
i can t be the reason
that you don t have a family 
it just feels totally different now 
and i can t do that again 
do you understand 
  okay 
  okay 
okay 
sorry 
ma 
dad 
fatima  bhai  kya haal hai 
oh  there s no plate 
oh 
oh  i forgot  um  i ve decided
i won t let you kick me out of the family 
since i m a member of the family 
it would stand to reason that i would get a vote
in whether or not i get kicked out 
and that vote would have to be unanimous   
standard parliamentary procedure 
so  all those in favor of not kicking kumail
out of the family  raise your hand 
great  motion to kick kumail
out of the family denied 
so you guys can just talk to me 
okay  you re giving me the silent treatment 
i figured that was what was gonna happen 
i have a solution 
so   hi  how are you  
that s just a real basic one 
you know 
 pass the salt   practical 
 always with the comedy  
mom  made that one specially for you 
 kumail  how did you become so much more handsome
than your brother naveed  
bullshit 
i admit  this one is designed
to stir up some controversy 
 it s interesting how you can t really
 kick someone out of your family  because
they will always be your family  
i agree with that one 
that s a good one 
so  i m gonna leave these here for you 
i am sorry i lied about the girls
and the lsat and all that 
that was wrong 
and one more thing 
i m moving to new york to pursue stand up 
but i am not leaving this family 
my parents  um  they want
me to get arranged marriage 
or  as it s  uh  called in pakistan  romance 
and earlier today  i told them everything 
i told them about my life 
i told them about emily 
they kicked me out of the family 
i may never talk to them again 
so that happened 
  what is it 
  can i come in 
okay 
i swear  you and dad are just
like my freshman year roommate 
but instead of just  like  boning random dudes 
you re just parenting all the time 
all over the place 
in every room of the house 
including right next to me 
we got to go 
home 
  no 
  yeah 
it s time 
i m not ready 
yeah  you know what 
you re strong 
and you are 
and we would go to the mosque
and hear graphic details
of religious people being killed 1 400 years ago 
i mean like  tarantino esque details 
and everyone would be crying 
like  competing to see who could cry the hardest 
and i could never cry 
and i was like  what is wrong
with me  am i broken 
the only time i ve cried that much
is during the first 15 minutes of up 
this is a picture of me and my mother 
i m seven years old 
you know people  they talk
about the  the new york water 
chicago water is very underrated  i think 
it s good 
hey  guys 
i think i might just pop out for a bit 
what  by yourself 
yeah  just   
hop around the block 
maybe get some frozen yogurt 
you okay  can you do it 
can you walk by yourself 
  yeah  dad 
  all right 
  have fun 
  if you feel a coma coming on  call us 
  dad  it s too soon 
  right

so the first time i came
to america  i was  like  14 
and i was just visiting my uncle in new york 
and it just happened to be thanksgiving 
my first day in america  my uncle took me
to the macy s thanksgiving day parade 
and i was like  this is every day in america 
as advertised 
every day  they have a party
celebrating garfield 
no day has lived up to that day 
i was  uh  lying to my parents 
i was telling them i was gonna be a lawyer 
and they re very disappointed 
 cause they wanted me to be a doctor 
and you guys are like 
why didn t you just tell them
that you wanted to be a doctor 
it s a lie anyway  and i m like 
well  it has to be believable 
if i told them  i want to be a doctor  
they d be like   bullshit  
if i said  lawyer   they re like   oh  okay 
that s something  
 cause there s a strict hierarchy 
it s  doctor  engineer  lawyer 
hundreds of jobs 
isis  then comedian 
ah  i m sorry 
it s very rude to heckle comedians 
oh  that wasn t a heckle 
i just kind of whoo hoo d for you 
well  see  that s a common misconception 
heckling doesn t have to be negative 
so if i was like   oh  my god 
you re amazing in bed  
that would be a   
heckle 
yeah  and now you re getting more laughs than me 
and i don t like that 
you want to come up  do my job
