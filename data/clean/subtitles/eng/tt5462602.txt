um ill tell you about myself
i grew up in pakistan
and people are always
asking me what was that like
really not that different from here
i mean we played cricket
which is just a spicier version of baseball
and we prayed a lot
well not a lot
just five times a day
and we marry someone our parents find for us
arranged marriage you know
but for me it was probably that we got
episodes of knight rider a little bit later
and by little bit later
i mean we just got episode two
but other than that it was exactly the same
so these are my real journals honestly
and this is the woman who wrote them
poor gal
yeah
sheshe has no idea that like
giant titties are about to sprout
and change her life dramatically
so uh thank you guys
theres no bad crowds dude only bad comedians
you complain about the crowd like all the time
yeah like thats when theyre really bad
thats like 90 of the time theyre really bad
look will you just watch
and give me notes tonight all right
if we both give each other
notes i think it helps
your notes are just add more fucks into the bit
that doesnt help anybody
hey fuck fucks a funny word
its soft on the top and its hard on the end
that was truly horrible
that was so bad
what happened

im making up next weeks schedule
okay cool
i was in bed with my girlfriend
and i was trying to mansplain
to her that you know
wewe are on one little rock
orbiting one star in a galaxy
of a billion stars in a universe
full of a billion galaxies
you know so i forgot your birthday
who gives a shit
like you are cosmically overreacting to this
honestly you are being super selfish
youre right but youre selfish
hey
have you guys heard of this
drug cocktail called cheese
uh i saw these news reports
so i looked up what cheese is
and cheese is a mixture
cheese is tylenol pm and heroin
so really its heroin
heroins doing the heavy lifting
just do the heroin
its very powerful
you already have heroin
is pakistan in the house
really
youre not from pakistan
i wouldve noticed you
are you kidding me
mm
he just gave you montreal
like you dont have to showcase
or audition or anything
no
it was too easy almost
like i wanted to struggle
i wanted i wanted a story
to be able to tell on talk
shows and instead like
you guys dont know
how tough it is not to struggle
itsits a struggle succeeding effortlessly
did he say anything about me
sure
what about me
he they both of you
he said those guys performed
i truly hate you actually
we all hate you
hi
hi
hello
um my names kumail
yeah we know
yeah we saw you perform
now that the niceties are out of the way um
i have to tell you that when you yelled at me
it really threw me off
and uh you really shouldnt heckle comedians
its so rude
i didnt heckle you
i just whoohood you
its supportive
okay thats a common misconception
uhhuh
but yelling anything at a
comedian is considered heckling
heckling doesnt have to be negative
so if i if i yelled out like
youre amazing in bed
thatd be a heckle
yeah it would be an accurate heckle
cool

ill be coordinating all the doctors
and orchestrating her treatment strategy
all the doctors
how many are there
five
five why so many i mean is that is that normal
yes
its standard for patients in the icu
we come at it from many angles we confer
were assessing her
we immediately
initiated orotracheal intubation
thankfully
it hasnt affected her heart at this point
we dont know
but we got her on a broad
spectrum of antibiotics
the exact nature of the infection yet
centering around the costodiaphragmatic recess
the right lung is battling critical infection
our theory is methicillinresistant
staphylococcus aureus
staphyl hold on thats a p
yeah
thats an f or a ph
ph no its staphylococcus
that was very reassuring wasnt it
apparently there are good and bad comas
and the kind that they put her in
the medicallyinduced coma
are definitely like
the good kind of coma
like you know how
there are good and bad carbs
gremlins
those can be good or bad
listen kumail
uh
were gonna handle things from here okay
youve been very helpful
thank you for
for signing the thing and

all right
peace in the mideast

i saw a sniffer dog
at the airport
he had a boner
does that mean drugs or bombs
thats good what if
what if instead
of it being at the airport
you quit comedy and never do comedy ever again
yeah
fuck you its a good bit
thats a funny bit
just for the sake of the public
that they wouldnt have to
look at your face or hear your words
thats
hey its okay that im not there right
like i dont need to be there right
whats up
what happened
he put his girlfriend in a coma yeah
yeah
you know thethe way you do
shes not my girlfriend
he didnt but he signed
a paper that allowed doctors to put
he he suggested it
shes gonna be fine
shes gonna be fine they said
shes gonna be fine so
theyre gonna be fine doctors know medical stuff
you
mmhmm
thats what doctors do
theyre good at medical stuff
this is a medicallyinduced coma
this is their specialty
you know it might be a good thing
like she might wake up with a new skill
like my cousin uh blacked out once and then
when he came to he thought
he knew a different language
did he
no apparently it was
it was just gibberish that he made up
it was brain damage
i got another taco bell one

you guys broke up
im not sure why youre here
youyou dont have to worry
about being committed to anything kumail
you didnt want to when she was awake
theres no need to do it when shes unconscious
its more complicated than that
is it
cause i know about the twoday rule
i know about the head shots and the secrets
she tells us everything
you really dont have to stay kumail
you have already done
a lot
im just gonna stay for a second
is this seat okay

we got the biopsy results
they are unfortunately inconclusive
uh were concerned because it is also
well wait wait what does that mean
it means its aggressive
it means that
i mean theythey couldnt find out what
the disease was or where the
where the virus came from
the bacteria whatever
butbut they took out
the infection so it shouldnt matter
i know thats what
i said
but uh her vitals didnt normalize
andand now they say the infection
itsits continuing to spread
its in her kidneys now
but the kidneys are so far from the lungs
i know
its an aggressive infection andand they said
what they got to do now is
they just got to figure out
what this mystery disease actually is
uhhuh uhhuh
uhhuh uhhuh
uhhuh
im calling northwestern
just hold on hold on
terry goddamn it
i think we should talk about
shut up
im sick of this shit terry
were getting her out of here
theyre in the middle of the
of the whole process
of elimination
so youre saying northwestern cant take
that information and continue the search
this place is a shithole
im sorry
anna could i have that
will you just stop for a second
all right they are the doctors
youyou act like you know
what youre talking about

theyre doing it
theyre the experts here and

on the real world had it
did you guys look for that
yes we did
you know she gets hurt all the time
and she messed up her ankle
recently could that be lupus
listen were looking into everything
were not holding anything back from you
were still just eliminating possibilities
cause beth wants to move her to northwestern
no emily should not be moved
the hospital will approve it
because itll get the liability off their hands
but we put her in a coma for a reason
to stabilize her
moving her could be very dangerous
trust me she is fighting this and so are we
hey terry ii was just talking to the n
you okay
yeah
yeah of course
fine totally fine
just uh
beth went to emilys so uh
im gonna wait here
till they kick me out you know

and she was saying that like
moving emily could be a bad idea
really
yeah she said it could be dangerous

id give anything just to
trade places with emily
you know
being a parent itsits a nightmare
loving somebody this much sucks

no not since i was a grownup
yes i do
ive been calling you that my whole life
oh oh oh oh
oh
sorry hon
whats happening
you okay you all right
what is that crap
we have to thicken your liquids for a bit
your esophagus isnt strong
enough to swallow yet
that shit tastes like semen
thats nice
for a father to hear
she wont have
any social inhibitions until
the the anesthetic wears off
no wait a minute honey
stop saying that
seriously mom you should try this
oh come on come on come on
theyll charge us 48 for it
dont worry about it
why are you here
i i havent heard her voice in awhile
hes been hes been here the whole time
could i speak with you both outside
yeah
well be right back
yeah well be right outside
all right
hey
emily has a rare condition called
adultonset stills disease
kumail mentioned emilys hurt ankle
and the swelling still hadnt gone down
even after several days in bed
which is strange
mm
stills disease is when the body
thinks healthy tissue
is an infection so it tries to fight it
uhhuh
its like a big biological misunderstanding
yeah yeah
so
we gave her antiinflammatories
and she stabilized within hours
shes gonna take time to recover
but shell be fine
wow
full recovery
what are you doing here
i was visiting someone down the hall
and i was like ill just pop in
and say hi to emily
oh
oh im joking
im here for you
youre an asshole and i dont like you
im not an asshole
im really not
oh no youre an asshole
you have a lot of drugs in you
so youre like not thinking as clearly
no dawg im not joking
youre not funny to me
you just make me sad
you make me sad inside of my heart
and it makes me sad to look at you
so i think you should probably go
just go and tell my mom i want her
will you please get my mom
im so sorry about that
yeah its fine yeah
um emily wants to see you
oh
um im gonna head out
i dont think i should be here
uh kumail heres the thing
your living condition its uh
its a potential health risk
and youre not that funny
but youre probably not suited
to do anything else either
so thats troublesome
you really made it sound like you were gonna
say something positive there
yeah i guess i did didnt i
well you know
you know i know the good stuff
i know the good stuff
i dont know so you know
you know how i feel
i got to
i got to get in
yeah
whatd i miss
whatd i miss
brick on top of the grilled cheese and
yeah
yeah i want that
be right back
bacon or something
hey
hey
so youre gonna hang around chicago for a while
yeah
shes got physical therapy
oh
did you ever think youd be excited
to have your daughter
go through physical therapy
its so strange that we could go through
one of the most intense experiences
of our lives together and just
just never see each other again
maybe
but i hope not
threw a bird at you and then ran away
and youre like oh crap
i own a bird now
hi little sad man
mopey boy
hey

its gonna suck at first
and maybe well eventually get paid to write jokes
mmhmm
but were gonna have each other
its gonna be the best
come on dude
you have to come
i know you did not
get montreal and that is only because
you did one of the worst sets ive ever seen
in my goddamn life
yeah
it was nonsense
a living disgrace
i would call it shit but i would be worried
that id be insulting actual shit
yeah it was so bonechilling to me
i thought a ghost had passed right through me
we dont have to keep going over
how bad the set was
i saw their faces
and the noises they didnt make
i felt one of my eggs die
doesnt that happen like every month
it happens every month kumail
but i dont always feel it and go
and thats what you made me do
yeah
im packing my things up
and im moving to new york
and guess what baby
youre coming with me
what about chris
have you ever seen a pigeon
try and pick up another pigeon
he will be fine
theres not enough room in the car probably
we leave in a week
all right
and i already called shotgun
chicago to pittsburgh
do not fuck this up
your destiny awaits
thisll be the biggest move of your life
other than the one from pakistan
yeah
i didnt have any kind of epiphany or anything
hey clink clink clink
clink clink
hey everybody
thank you for coming
i just want to say a couple uh
a couple of words here
mom why is kumail here
cause he was there the whole time you know
i invited the nurses i invited him
and um for
i want to say something i want to say something
dad
emily come on up come on up here
talk amongst yourselves
this might take a
emily successfully peeled an orange this morning
dad
yeah
it was it was a clementine
full disclosure a clementine
its those little ones that you know
a baby monkey could peel it
but uh but she did it
andand yeah so thats all
we just
thank you everybody
hey
hi
i like your cane
i heard pimpin aint easy
right
hey could we talk for a second
sure
so ive been collecting some things uh
that are important to me
and i wanted to show them to you
i call this my bag of devotion
uh so this is uh all the visitor passes
from when i visited you when you were in the
um
so these are the tickets
from when your parents came to see me perform
and uh i i realized how great they are
and how great you are
and how great honesty is
what did you do
did you cremate someone
these are the ashes of all the pakistani women
not the women the pictures
of the pakistani women
i thought this was a good idea
and it feels kind of
it feels a little stupid
i know i was a terrible boyfriend
but i have changed
and i am the person you need me to be
i really am
so
will you take me back
kumail im really glad that you
went through this experience
but you have to understand that
that all happened when i was asleep
like you felt one way a few weeks ago
and now youre saying you feel
the total opposite way
and the only thing thats changed
is that i was in a coma
honestly ii
i look at all of this and i just think
you know i just cant do it again
and i cant
i
i cant be the reason
that you dont have a family
it just feels totally different now
and i cant do that again
do you understand
okay
okay
okay
sorry
ma
dad
fatima bhai kya haal hai
oh theres no plate
oh
oh i forgot um ive decided
i wont let you kick me out of the family
since im a member of the family
it would stand to reason that i would get a vote
in whether or not i get kicked out
and that vote would have to be unanimous
standard parliamentary procedure
so all those in favor of not kicking kumail
out of the family raise your hand
great motion to kick kumail
out of the family denied
so you guys can just talk to me
okay youre giving me the silent treatment
i figured that was what was gonna happen
i have a solution
so hi how are you
thats just a real basic one
you know
pass the salt practical
always with the comedy
mom made that one specially for you
kumail how did you become so much more handsome
than your brother naveed
bullshit
i admit this one is designed
to stir up some controversy
its interesting how you cant really
kick someone out of your family because
they will always be your family
i agree with that one
thats a good one
so im gonna leave these here for you
i am sorry i lied about the girls
and the lsat and all that
that was wrong
and one more thing
im moving to new york to pursue standup
but i am not leaving this family
my parents um they want
me to get arranged marriage
or as its uh called in pakistan romance
and earlier today i told them everything
i told them about my life
i told them about emily
they kicked me out of the family
i may never talk to them again
so that happened
what is it
can i come in
okay
i swear you and dad are just
like my freshman year roommate
but instead of just like boning random dudes
youre just parenting all the time
all over the place
in every room of the house
including right next to me
we got to go
home
no
yeah
its time
im not ready
yeah you know what
youre strong
and you are
and we would go to the mosque
and hear graphic details
of religious people being killed 1400 years ago
i mean like tarantinoesque details
and everyone would be crying
like competing to see who could cry the hardest
and i could never cry
and i was like what is wrong
with me am i broken
the only time ive cried that much
is during the first 15 minutes of up
this is a picture of me and my mother
im seven years old
you know people they talk
about the the new york water
chicago water is very underrated i think
its good
hey guys
i think i might just pop out for a bit
what by yourself
yeah just
hop around the block
maybe get some frozen yogurt
you okay can you do it
can you walk by yourself
yeah dad
all right
have fun
if you feel a coma coming on call us
dad its too soon

so the first time i came
to america i was like 14
and i was just visiting my uncle in new york
and it just happened to be thanksgiving
my first day in america my uncle took me
to the macys thanksgiving day parade
and i was like this is every day in america
as advertised
every day they have a party
celebrating garfield
no day has lived up to that day
i was uh lying to my parents
i was telling them i was gonna be a lawyer
and theyre very disappointed
cause they wanted me to be a doctor
and you guys are like
why didnt you just tell them
that you wanted to be a doctor
its a lie anyway and im like
well it has to be believable
if i told them i want to be a doctor
theyd be like bullshit
if i said lawyer theyre like oh okay
thats something
cause theres a strict hierarchy
its doctor engineer lawyer
hundreds of jobs
isis then comedian
ah im sorry
its very rude to heckle comedians
oh that wasnt a heckle
i just kind of whoohood for you
well see thats a common misconception
heckling doesnt have to be negative
so if i was like oh my god
youre amazing in bed
that would be a
heckle
yeah and now youre getting more laughs than me
and i dont like that
you want to come up do my job
