let me tell you something 
this is the ultimate blend to drink 
  where did you find this place 
  i first came in
because of the name 
  hmm 
  serendipity  it s one
of my favorite words 
  it is  why 
  uh huh 
 cause it s such a nice sound for
what it means  a fortunate accident 
  mm 
  except i don t really
believe in accidents 
  i think fate s behind everything 
  oh  you do 
  yeah 
  fate s behind everything 
  i think so 
  everything s predestined 
  we don t have any choice at all 
  i think we make our own decisions 
i just think that fate
sends us little signs 
and it s how we read the signs
that determines whether
we re happy or not 
  little signals  yeah 
  yeah 
fortunate accidents 
lucky discoveries 
columbus in america 
  yeah  or fleming
discovering penicillin 
  penicillin 
  fleming is his name 
  yes 
or  jonathan
and the gloves  
  i don t know that one 
  you don t know that story 
it s an old
folk tale classic 
our hero  jonathan  goes out
in search of black gloves 
and in a perfect act
of  serendipiocity 
or  serendipaciousness  
he runs into a beautiful  attractive
english girl with a boyfriend 
you have a boyfriend  right 
  yeah  i do 
  that s what i thought 
  and you have the glove lady 
  yes  i do 
  mm hmm

gloves you bought yourself

i usually appreciate
my own thoughtfulness 
what do you want for christmas

looking at my freckles 
it s the curse
of the english  i m afraid 
fair skin and bad teeth 
no  you have great teeth 
those aren t just freckles 
if you look closely 
you can see cassiopeia 
  what 
  right there 
hold on a minute 
okay  all right 
here s the story 
a long time ago in ethiopia 
there was this queen
named cassiopeia   
who thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the entire world 
and there wasn t anybody in
the kingdom who wasn t offended   
by this woman s
relentless vanity 
and then one day  she really
screwed up and offended the gods 
i don t remember what she did and
i don t remember who she offended 
but it was bad 
she crossed the line 
but anyway  poseidon  the sea god 
punished cassiopeia   
by placing her in the heavens
upside down on her throne 
stuck for eternity with her skirt
around her shoulders   
and all the blood
rushing to her head 
and now she s just
a constellation in the sky 
a bunch of english freckles
in the shape of a throne 
so she made
one tragic mistake 
and paid for eternity 
correct 
  yeah  yeah  yeah 
  legible  legible 
  i can t believe i m doing this 
  now  please  please 
let fate take
its proper course 
oh 
  that was an accident 
write down that again  please

that was a sign 
fate s telling us
to back off 
if fate didn t want
us to be together  then why
did we meet tonight  huh 
  gotcha 
  well  i don t know 
  but it s not an exact science 
it s a feeling 
  well  what if you re wrong

of course they postponed it 
and it s overseas somewhere 
and they ve canceled my passport 
and i can t be a part of it 
and it s ridiculous
and awkward and horrible 
so thank you 
i take this very seriously 
it s a gift
to be the best man 
they say that once in your lifetime 
someone comes along   
whom you re absolutely
meant to be with 
everything feels great 
stars are aligned 
body and spirit
are in balance 
formy friend
jonathan trager 
that person was me 
but as you know 
jonny and i were simpatico 
we were brothers
from another mother 
we were friends
since freshman year 
i watched him go out
with woman after woman 
and he d always come crawling  
he would come crawling
back to me 
  it was embarrassing 
  you loved it 
but then one night he came home
and things were different 
his adolescent dream of becoming
a documentary filmmaker
was a thing of the past 
  thank god 
  he hardly even responded   
to my playful yet tormented
flicks of my finger   
against the soft part of his skull
as he studied for finals 
and that is because
he had found her 
the woman he was meant to be with 
and if anyone is qualified   
to know when he met his soul mate 
it would be me  his first wife 
she s smart  she s funny 
she s beautiful 
in short  she s the kind of woman
that any man would dream about 
and i think we all have 
so it is with sadness   
and fond  fond memories   
that i raise my glass   
to the new
mrs  jonathan trager 
i ll tell you what 
i ll tell you something  my friends 
if i had to lose jonny to anyone 
i can t imagine
a more perfect woman than halley 
cheers to both of you 
  how drunk is he
on a scale of one to ten 
  twelve 
you think we ll ever out romance
dean and courtney 
  i don t know  i don t think
i ve ever seen them fight 
  me neither 
must be a bitch
on their sex life 
we have a pomegranate soufflé
which is amazing  which is
different than the sorbet 
listen  we d love
to join you guys 
but courtney has to wake up 
so i got to be good 
halley  listen to me 
it s not too late to back out 
  good night  dean 
  and i m at 166th and  
good night  courtney 
mama  you don t want to see this 
i need   i need to snuggle 
  i m gonna go sleep it off 
listen  you re wonderful 
  good night 
  you know what  you need me 
  take care  come on  hon 
you guys  listen  i hate to
tell you  but i gotta go home too 
i have to  i gotta get up
at 8 00 in the morning 
my day is crazy tomorrow 
  come in for one drink 
  he doesn t want to come 
he doesn t have to come 
  i ll see you in about 20 hours 
  bye bye  dear 
  i love you  son 
  night night 
  george 
  take care 
you okay 
  you better be up later 
  yeah  why 
  because i m gonna come home
and get undressed   
  uh huh 
  and climb into bed 
  uh huh 
act like we just got
over a terrible fight 
see you later now 
reading is good for you 
knowledge 
reading 
  hold on  hold on  listen  listen 
  i read it a long time ago 
  i ll throw in the screenplay to
the bridges of madison county 
  i saw the movie  it was great 
okay  and  
and nothing  i mean  
i mean  i did nothing 
i   i just let her
walk out of the party
and i didn t say anything to her 
and now she s gone forever 
i mean 
she was my soul mate 
kenny  i honestly
think it s dangerous
to use the term  soul mate  
it implies there s
some magical element
that we have no control over 
like fate or destiny 
i think holding on to beliefs like
that stops us doing the real work 
and the fact is 
if your therapy stays on track 
i think you ll find there
are many  many people out there
you could easily be happy with 
you truly believe
all that  sara 
yeah  i really do 
  there you go 
  thanks 
you got to say yes  first 
yes 
  wait a second 
  ow 
  let me   ow  ow  ow 
  i got it  i got it 
  ow  ow  ow 
  i got it 
okay  you re not gonna
read into this  right  sara 
  i mean  it s just
an accident  nothing more 
  no 
god  we ll
get it refitted 
it s beautiful 
i love it 
you you get changed 
i m gonna call ryan 
tell him you said yes 
  why  was he worried 
  not about you  about the tour 
he s hoping to fit the honeymoon
into the schedule 
how does bora bora sound 
very    sexy sexy 
now  if you re a golfer
on a one hour lunch break 
you d use that time up
just getting to the nearest
course out of manhattan 
all this was
a long overdue solution 
formerly a dilapidated pier
and converted just five years ago 
the range offers the inhabitants
of this concrete jungle   
the chance to keep
their drives straight 
their short games accurate   
and most of all  brings the joys
and frustrations of golf   
back to city folk 
this is nick roberts

mr  marrying man 
  hi  uh  where s lauren 
  oh  lauren took the day off 
my name is sara

i m not thrilled with having
that  just cut hair  look
for my own wedding  so  
  i ll just take a little bit off 
  i gotta live with these pictures
the rest of my life 
  just a little bit 
  please  you know  uh

i keep running into her 
i keep finding it 
it keeps happening 
she was at the golf range 
she s a big girl now with big hips 
all right 
then i gotta leave
 cause sara s gonna cut my hair 
and the guy in the taxi 
he s serenading me   sara  
i m telling you  the universe
keeps revealing her to me 
  screwing with my head 
  you re getting married
in three days 
  that s my point 
  it s entirely duplicitous 
think about it  why would you risk
your relationship with halley   
  just to search
for some pipe dream 
  just hear me out  man 
i m sure that
i love halley  all right 
and maybe every time
you fall in love with somebody 
it s a completely
different experience 
so it s a mistake to compare them 
i get it  but  
all right 
it s like halley is
the godfather  part ii 
she s what 
godfather  part ii 
that was an incredible movie 
might be better than the original 
all right 
but no matter how much you love
the godfather  part ii 
you still have
to see the original   
to understand and appreciate
the sequel  don t ya 
come on  is it too much to ask from
my oldest friend to help me out 
  you ve already got
the fairy tale marriage 
  i m the best man 
you work in the biggest
newspaper in the world 
help me find her 
let me tell you something 
contrary to popular new york myth 
the times
is not omniscient 
i need a last name 
i need a social security number 
  if we find the book  
  it it it s a dead end 
you know that 
  unless we search every
book store in new york 
  you did that 
  years ago  do you remember 
  maybe i missed a store 
  maybe somebody bought it
and sold it back 
  you know what 
i don t want any part of this 
all right 
maybe i am just getting cold feet 
i m telling you right now 
british women do not age well 
you know  i mean  years ago 
yes  she was a luscious treat 
you know  she probably looked like 
you know  baby spice 
but now
she could look like  
old spice

check on the shelf across
from the caligula incense

i met a million
and a half hours ago 
a guy i don t even remember 
except for this   
vague picture i have
inside my head 
it was just a few seconds 
a fragment  really 
and it was like   
in that moment 
the whole universe existed
just to bring us together 
that s why i m here 
that s why i m gonna let fate
take me wherever it wants to go 
because when all this is over 
at least i m never gonna have
to think of him ever again

he s a bald fascist   
who picks his nose
and wipes it under the car seat

provide no viable services and still
manage to generate profits   
for all of its lazy  day trading

i think i swallowed a filling 
thank you for letting us in 
now  mr  mignon 
we have an odd and some what
personal question to ask you 
mignon 
mr  mignon 
mignon  like the meat 
mr  mignon  a few years ago 
did you live with a girl 
first name sara 
attractive  dark hair 
kind of  like  mysterious 
you know  really amazing girl 
oui 
  do you know where we can
locate this individual 
  no  i do not 
  do you remember her last name 
  no 
oh  come on  you don t
even remember the last name
of your ex girlfriend 
  i find that hard to believe 
  you don t understand anything 
she was not my girlfriend 
she was just  uh  a roommate 
she stayed with me
for a very short period of time 
  she was placed with me by  
  a roommate finder s service 
oui  she stayed with me with
her boyfriend for a few months  
  i don t care about him 
  and then he moved out
very quickly 
and at the end of the year 
she moved out too 
yeah  but did she
leave anything behind 
maybe with her last name on it 
like a receipt  a bill 
  like a piece of luggage 
  no  no  no 
anything would help 
really  anything 
i remember she sat on me 
she   she sat on you 
yes  she sat on me
for a while 
i found her   
inspiring 
i guess that is why i started
painting her in the first place 
oh  she sat for you 
i m sorry 
that is what i said 
  that s what he said 
  that s what i said 
clearly 
do you happen
to have the painting 
hey  now you re gonna see
what it s all about 
you know  you see her face 
okay  yeah 
this is her  yes 
yeah  sure 
around the eyes a little 
i mean  i m definitely getting
the british thing  you know 
with the crown and the scepter 
  do you have a name for
the roommate finder s service 
  they would have the information 
no  i do not 
but if it helps  i do remember
where the service was located 
  absolutely 
  yes  where  where 
  manhattan 
  where in manhattan  mr  mignon 
on 60thstreet 
  east side or west side 
  it was just next to that  
on the left of that
splendid little patisserie 
serendipity 
that s it 
get   get ready 
happy birthday 
it s on the house 
thank you 
thanks 
oh  i m a god awful friend 
no  you will be if you sing 
eve  thanks so much
for coming with me 
you re welcome 
sara  you know 
it s a wonderful thought 
the idea that all of life 
that every single event
is part of some master plan   
designed to lead us
to our universal soul mate 
but if that s really true 
then what s the point of living 
or making decisions 
hell  why should we even
get out of bed in the morning 
for the cake 
no  not for cake 
so that you make mistakes 
mistakes like this trip 
and if you re smart enough 
you learn from your mistakes 
you figure it out 
you you think 
you realize that life
isn t some elaborate stage play
with directions for the actors 
life s a mess  sara 
it s it s
chaos personified 
i have to give it
all up now  don t i 
sara  you have a fiancé who 
despite his weird
eastern music 
which we hope is
just a phase  let s hope 
loves you
very  very  very much 
it s not giving up 
it s growing up 
let s get out of here 
yeah 
  here s one 
  ooh  catch it 
  it s a bridal shop 
  oh  my god  the irony 
  wait right here 
i ll be right back  stay here 
  why 
  time  please 
  uh  about 7 30 
right  right 
they moved downtown  if we get lucky
with traffic  we can still hit it 
  what time is rehearsal 
  can t do it 
  taxi 
  it s over  man 
what 
  what are you talking about 
  how can i ignore that 
 bless the goddamn bride  
  what 
  it can t get
any more clearer than this 
i m not supposed to be doing this 
it s not in the cards 
hey  it s another
one of your clues  man 
let s talk about it in the cab   
  on the way over 
  it s not a clue  it s a sign 
  what s the difference 
  a clue is what a detective
uses to find a suspect 
the receipt  the warehouse 
that french guy   those
are clues  this is a sign 
me never finding the book 
that s a sign 
sara never finding the  5 00 bill 
that s a sign 
how could something
not happening be a sign 
maybe the absence
of signs is a sign 
isn t it 
that s lucid 
look  i don t know  man 
maybe there is no fate 
and if there is 
it s not working for me 
you know  it s not actually supposed
to end this way  by the way 
we re supposed to pull the curtain
and see the wizard  all right 
  get to the end of the river 
  this is the end of the river 
my wedding rehearsal   
starts in less
than an hour 
  my bride is waiting for me 
  let me ask you something here 
if sara were here right now 
poof  came down  what would
she tell you to do 
she would tell me to run 
not walk to the waldorf   
because all the signs
point to me getting married 
look  wedding dress 
lots of white 
  i hate to state the obvious  
  state it 
if you don t do this 
you may never find out who sara is 
maybe i was never
supposed to 
maybe all this
is just a maze   
designed to lead me directly
back to where i started 
which is getting married 
they should make pills
for this 
  halley 
  oh  my god  eve 
what a crazy coincidence 
how are you 
  good 
  oh  my god 
sara  can you believe   
that i was halley s r a 
in college

he opens a window  
how about telling me
i did the right thing 
i don t have to tell you 
i wrote it 
  what s this 
  it s your obituary 
  nice 
  turns out i had writer s block   
penning your best man speech 
and that s what ended up coming out 
blame it on the day job 
  twenty  right 
  thanks 
  you going to see courtney 
  absolutely 
i needed this 
you know  the greeks
didn t write obituaries 
they only asked one question
after a man died 
 did he have passion  
how do i look 
like a jackass 
  good luck  man 
  thank you 
jonathan trager 
prominent television producer
for espn 
died last night from
complications of losing
his soul mate and his fiancé 
he was 35 years old
and soft spoken and obsessive 
trager never looked the part
of a hopeless romantic 
but in the final days
of his life 
he revealed
an unknown side of his psyche 
this hidden
quasi jungian persona   
surfaced during
the agatha christie like pursuit
for his long reputed soul mate 
a woman whom he only spent
a few precious hours with 
sadly  the protracted search
ended late saturday night   
in complete and utter failure 
yet even in certain defeat 
the courageous trager
secretly clung to the belief   
that life is not merely
a series of meaningless
accidents or coincidences 
uh uh  but rather
it s a tapestry of events   
that culminate in
an exquisite  sublime plan 
asked about the loss
of his dear friend  dean kansky 
the pulitzer prize winning
author and executive editor
of the new york times 
described jonathan as a changed man
in the last days of his life 
 things were clearer for him  
kansky noted 
ultimately  jonathan concluded
that if we are to live life
in harmony with the universe 
we must all possess a powerful
faith in what the ancients
used to call  fatum  
  what we currently
refer to as destiny 
  destiny 
  so what are you gonna do 
  i don t know 
i guess i m just gonna
try and find him or something 
i don t think you should do that 
i really don t 
  well  what do you think
i should do 
  just be here 
  i feel it 
i feel it in the air 
  eve  what s happened to you 
you ve become your own
worst nightmare right there 
bye 
and please put a jacket on 
it s freezing out here 
i m jon 
i m sara 
  happy anniversary 
  when did you get to be
so unabashedly romantic 
i think it s good luck we return
each year to the scene of the crime 
  cheers 
  cheers 
oh  i don t think so 
no beverages on the premises 
  i m gonna have
to ask you to leave 
  hey  how you doing 
  don t you remember me

  miss carbon copy  i see

black cashmere gloves

that ll be the closing bell 
perhaps tomorrow

except sundays and holidays

of the management
