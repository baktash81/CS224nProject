serendipity its one
of my favorite words

what it means a fortunate accident

except i dont really
believe in accidents
i think fates behind everything
oh you do
yeah
fates behind everything
i think so
everythings predestined
we dont have any choice at all
i think we make our own decisions
i just think that fate
sends us little signs
and its how we read the signs
that determines whether
were happy or not
little signals yeah
yeah
fortunate accidents
lucky discoveries
columbus in america
yeah or fleming
discovering penicillin
penicillin

if you look closely
you can see cassiopeia
what
right there
hold on a minute
okay all right
heres the story
a long time ago in ethiopia
there was this queen
named cassiopeia
who thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the entire world
and there wasnt anybody in
the kingdom who wasnt offended
by this womans
relentless vanity
and then one day she really
screwed up and offended the gods
i dont remember what she did and
i dont remember who she offended
but it was bad
she crossed the line
but anyway poseidon the sea god
punished cassiopeia
by placing her in the heavens
upside down on her throne
stuck for eternity with her skirt
around her shoulders
and all the blood
rushing to her head
and now shes just
a constellation in the sky
a bunch of english freckles
in the shape of a throne
so she made
one tragic mistake
and paid for eternity
correct
yeah yeah yeah
legible legible
i cant believe im doing this
now please please
let fate take
its proper course
oh
that was an accident
write down that again please
i cant
that was a sign
fates telling us
to back off
if fate didnt want
us to be together then why
did we meet tonight huh

im sorry
i usually have to
beg to be a part of weddings
and if i do get into the wedding
of course they postponed it
and its overseas somewhere
and theyve canceled my passport
and i cant be a part of it
and its ridiculous
and awkward and horrible
so thank you
i take this very seriously
its a gift
to be the best man
they say that once in your lifetime
someone comes along
whom youre absolutely
meant to be with
everything feels great
stars are aligned
body and spirit
are in balance
formy friend
jonathan trager
that person was me
but as you know
jonny and i were simpatico
we were brothers
from another mother
we were friends
since freshman year
i watched him go out
with woman after woman
and hed always come crawling
he would come crawling
back to me
it was embarrassing
you loved it
but then one night he came home
and things were different
his adolescent dream of becoming
a documentary filmmaker
was a thing of the past
thank god
he hardly even responded
to my playful yet tormented
flicks of my finger
against the soft part of his skull
as he studied for finals
and that is because
he had found her
the woman he was meant to be with
and if anyone is qualified
to know when he met his soul mate
it would be me his first wife
shes smart shes funny
shes beautiful
in short shes the kind of woman
that any man would dream about
and i think we all have
so it is with sadness
and fond fond memories
that i raise my glass
to the new
mrs jonathan trager
ill tell you what
ill tell you something my friends
if i had to lose jonny to anyone
i cant imagine
a more perfect woman than halley
cheers to both of you
how drunk is he
on a scale of one to ten
twelve
you think well ever outromance
dean and courtney
i dont know i dont think
ive ever seen them fight
me neither
must be a bitch
on their sex life
we have a pomegranate soufflé
which is amazing which is
different than the sorbet
listen wed love
to join you guys
but courtney has to wake up
so i got to be good
halley listen to me
its not too late to back out
good night dean
and im at 166th and
good night courtney
mama you dont want to see this
i need i need to snuggle
im gonna go sleep it off
listen youre wonderful
good night
you know what you need me
take care come on hon
you guys listen i hate to

byebye dear
i love you son
nightnight
george
take care
you okay
you better be up later
yeah why
because im gonna come home
and get undressed
uhhuh
and climb into bed
uhhuh
act like we just got
over a terrible fight
see you later now
reading is good for you
knowledge
reading
hold on hold on listen listen
i read it a long time ago
ill throw in the screenplay to
the bridges of madison county
i saw the movie it was great
okay and
and nothing i mean
i mean i did nothing
i i just let her
walk out of the party
and i didnt say anything to her
and now shes gone forever
i mean
she was my soul mate
kenny i honestly
think its dangerous
to use the term soul mate
it implies theres
some magical element
that we have no control over
like fate or destiny
i think holding on to beliefs like
that stops us doing the real work
and the fact is
if your therapy stays on track
i think youll find there
are many many people out there
you could easily be happy with
you truly believe
all that sara
yeah i really do
there you go
thanks
you got to say yes first
yes
wait a second
ow
let me ow ow ow
i got it i got it
ow ow ow

youd use that time up
just getting to the nearest
course out of manhattan
all this was
a long overdue solution
formerly a dilapidated pier
and converted just five years ago
the range offers the inhabitants
of this concrete jungle
the chance to keep
their drives straight
their short games accurate
and most of all brings the joys
and frustrations of golf
back to city folk

thats my point
its entirely duplicitous
think about it why would you risk
your relationship with halley
just to search
for some pipe dream
just hear me out man
im sure that
i love halley all right
and maybe every time
you fall in love with somebody
its a completely
different experience
so its a mistake to compare them
i get it but
all right
its like halley is
the godfather part ii
shes what
godfather part ii
that was an incredible movie
might be better than the original
all right
but no matter how much you love
the godfather part ii
you still have
to see the original
to understand and appreciate
the sequel dont ya
come on is it too much to ask from
my oldest friend to help me out
youve already got
the fairytale marriage
im the best man
you work in the biggest
newspaper in the world
help me find her
let me tell you something
contrary to popular new york myth
the times
is not omniscient
i need a last name
i need a social security number
if we find the book
ititits a dead end
you know that
unless we search every
book store in new york

years ago do you remember

and sold it back
you know what
i dont want any part of this
all right
maybe i am just getting cold feet
im telling you right now
british women do not age well
you know i mean years ago
yes she was a luscious treat

she could look like
old spice

vague picture i have
inside my head
it was just a few seconds
a fragment really
and it was like
in that moment
the whole universe existed
just to bring us together
thats why im here

have made unhealthy sums of money
forming internet companies
that create no concrete products
provide no viable services and still
manage to generate profits
for all of its lazy daytrading
sonofabitch shareholders
meanwhile as a tortured member
of the disenfranchised proletariat
you find some altruistic need
to protect these digital
plantation owners

thank you for letting us in
now mr mignon
we have an odd and some what
personal question to ask you
mignon
mr mignon
mignon like the meat
mr mignon a few years ago
did you live with a girl
first name sara
attractive dark hair
kind of like mysterious
you know really amazing girl
oui
do you know where we can
locate this individual
no i do not
do you remember her last name
no
oh come on you dont
even remember the last name
of your exgirlfriend
i find that hard to believe
you dont understand anything
she was not my girlfriend
she was just uh a roommate
she stayed with me
for a very short period of time
she was placed with me by
a roommate finders service
oui she stayed with me with
her boyfriend for a few months
i dont care about him
and then he moved out
very quickly
and at the end of the year
she moved out too
yeah but did she
leave anything behind
maybe with her last name on it
like a receipt a bill
like a piece of luggage
no no no
anything would help
really anything
i remember she sat on me
she she sat on you
yes she sat on me
for a while
i found her
inspiring
i guess that is why i started
painting her in the first place
oh she sat for you
im sorry
that is what i said
thats what he said
thats what i said
clearly
do you happen
to have the painting
hey now youre gonna see
what its all about
you know you see her face
okay yeah
this is her yes
yeah sure
around the eyes a little
i mean im definitely getting
the british thing you know
with the crown and the scepter
do you have a name for
the roommate finders service
they would have the information
no i do not
but if it helps i do remember
where the service was located
absolutely
yes where where
manhattan
where in manhattan mr mignon
on 60thstreet
east side or west side
it was just next to that
on the left of that
splendid little patisserie
serendipity
thats it
get get ready
happy birthday
its on the house
thank you
thanks
oh im a godawful friend
no you will be if you sing
eve thanks so much
for coming with me
youre welcome
sara you know
its a wonderful thought
the idea that all of life
that every single event
is part of some master plan
designed to lead us
to our universal soul mate
but if thats really true
then whats the point of living
or making decisions
hell why should we even
get out of bed in the morning
for the cake
no not for cake
so that you make mistakes
mistakes like this trip
and if youre smart enough
you learn from your mistakes
you figure it out
youyou think
you realize that life
isnt some elaborate stage play
with directions for the actors
lifes a mess sara
itsits
chaos personified
i have to give it
all up now dont i
sara you have a fiancé who
despite his weird
eastern music
which we hope is
just a phase lets hope
loves you
very very very much
its not giving up
its growing up
lets get out of here
yeah
heres one
ooh catch it
its a bridal shop
oh my god the irony
wait right here
ill be right back stay here
why
time please
uh about 730
right right
they moved downtown if we get lucky
with traffic we can still hit it
what time is rehearsal
cant do it
taxi
its over man
what
what are you talking about
how can i ignore that
bless the goddamn bride
what
it cant get
any more clearer than this
im not supposed to be doing this
its not in the cards
hey its another
one of your clues man
lets talk about it in the cab
on the way over
its not a clue its a sign
whats the difference
a clue is what a detective
uses to find a suspect
the receipt the warehouse
that french guy those
are clues this is a sign
me never finding the book
thats a sign
sara never finding the 500 bill
thats a sign
how could something
not happening be a sign
maybe the absence
of signs is a sign
isnt it
thats lucid
look i dont know man
maybe there is no fate
and if there is
its not working for me
you know its not actually supposed
to end this way by the way
were supposed to pull the curtain
and see the wizard all right
get to the end of the river
this is the end of the river
my wedding rehearsal
starts in less
than an hour
my bride is waiting for me
let me ask you something here
if sara were here right now
poof came down what would
she tell you to do
she would tell me to run
not walk to the waldorf
because all the signs
point to me getting married
look wedding dress
lots of white
i hate to state the obvious
state it
if you dont do this
you may never find out who sara is
maybe i was never
supposed to
maybe all this
is just a maze
designed to lead me directly
back to where i started
which is getting married
they should make pills
for this
halley

good luck man
thank you
jonathan trager
prominent television producer
for espn
died last night from
complications of losing
his soul mate and his fiancé
he was 35 years old
and softspoken and obsessive
trager never looked the part
of a hopeless romantic
but in the final days
of his life
he revealed
an unknown side of his psyche
this hidden
quasijungian persona
surfaced during
the agatha christielike pursuit
for his longreputed soul mate
a woman whom he only spent
a few precious hours with
sadly the protracted search
ended late saturday night
in complete and utter failure
yet even in certain defeat
the courageous trager
secretly clung to the belief
that life is not merely
a series of meaningless
accidents or coincidences
uhuh but rather
its a tapestry of events
that culminate in
an exquisite sublime plan
asked about the loss
of his dear friend dean kansky
the pulitzer prizewinning
author and executive editor
of the new york times
described jonathan as a changed man
in the last days of his life
things were clearer for him
kansky noted
ultimately jonathan concluded
that if we are to live life
in harmony with the universe
we must all possess a powerful
faith in what the ancients
used to call fatum
what we currently
refer to as destiny
destiny
so what are you gonna do
i dont know
i guess im just gonna
try and find him or something
i dont think you should do that
i really dont
well what do you think
i should do
just be here
i feel it
i feel it in the air
eve whats happened to you
youve become your own
worst nightmare right there
bye
and please put a jacket on
its freezing out here
im jon
im sara
happy anniversary
when did you get to be
so unabashedly romantic
i think its good luck we return
each year to the scene of the crime
cheers
cheers
oh i dont think so
no beverages on the premises
im gonna have
to ask you to leave
hey how you doing
dont you remember me
this is the girl
yes i do
miss carbon copy i see

if youre not gonna
purchase anything
please make room
for paying customers

black cashmere gloves
oh im sorry
thatll be the closing bell
perhaps tomorrow
store hours 1000 to 700
except sundays and holidays
perhaps tomorrow
store hours 1000 to 700
except sundays and holidays

at the discretion
