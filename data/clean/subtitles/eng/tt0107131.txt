missed peter love
shadows victory really
belief thing got us
moment saw years lift
puppy
reunited best friend
come come
shadow oh good see boy
turned go inside house
strange new feeling came
family
found sacrifice
friendship
even love
mushy stuff
come chance come inside
last
first time life
home
turkey
turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey turkey
