from this time and place
that the torch
has been passed
to a new generation

born in this century
let every nation know
that we shall
pay any price
bear any burden
support any friend
oppose any foe
to assure the survival
and the success
of liberty

theres absolutely
no question
the first cavalry division
is the latest concept
in mobile warfare
one division is worth
212 russian
and 6 chinese divisions
how well will
the individual soldier
stand up here
in vietnam
what do you think
dad about that
i dont know
13000 miles
thats a long way to go
to fight a war
they fought the french
and the japanese
for 30 years
can they
be weeded out
anything
that lives in a cave
can be weeded out
i just hope they send you
to europe or korea or
they cant
someplace safe
every marine has
a tour of duty there
its not like the army
whats wrong with you
you served
uncle bob served
i know ronnie
i know
remember what
president kennedy said

the right thing
communism has
to be stopped
its gods will
you go

be careful
thats all
up there in hanoi

on the military system
dont you know what being a marine
means to me dad
ever since
i was a kid
ive wanted
to serve my country
and i want to go
i want to go
to vietnam

government
stand up
to the north

ifn you want some
yes sir it was
a real nice funeral
marine honor guard came
all the way down from atlanta
in their fancy uniforms
fired their rifles
up in the sky
thank you
the drums was beating
course it was nothing
like the big war
100 years ago
down here
but there was billy
and bruce bruce crabtree
andy henderson
and the rutledge boy
lance
yeah lance
he was a nice boy
for the life of me
i still cant quite
figure that war out
why we had to go
all that dang way to fight it
and whys we had to lose
so many young men
cant figure it out
but we got a proud tradition
here in this town
billys greatgrandfather
was at the first bull run
my pa was
over in france in 18
dont forget you were
over in the pacific in 44
guadalcanal
is that right
yeah well i guess
this familys fought
in every war that uh
this countrys ever had
i reckon were ready
to do it again
ifn we have to
course they never did know
what done happened and all
there was a letter
from a colonel
i think it was
colonel moore
thats right
colonel moore
he said there was
a bad ambush one night
said that billy distinguished himself
in the fighting
he also told us that
billy died real quick
thats good
that he died quick
i was
his squad leader
i didnt know billy
real well
he was new
kind of quiet
we didnt talk much
to new guys
he was 19
is that right
thats right 19
only son
yes sir
my only boy
i think he said
he was married
and you were pregnant
i remember
the day he was killed
uh it was
a strange day
we were out on patrol
near a beach area
and oh
it was very confusing
there was screaming
and firing
uh
it was getting late
and there were these
children uh
these babies
that we killed
by mistake
how awful
and then it
got really crazy
and we had to pull back
because the nva
were coming up on us
and we got scattered
in the dunes
people were yelling
at anything
firing at anything
and that was when it
it happened
i was uh confused
scared
i raised my rifle
three times
and shots
the body fell
in the dunes
god this is
this is very difficult
for me to say
we dont have
to hear this ron
but i think i was the one
that killed your son
i was the one
i was the one
i was the one
whats done
