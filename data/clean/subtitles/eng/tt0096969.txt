here s the pitch 
mickey swings 
and he connects 
there s a long drive
deep to center field 
it is going  going

into the bleachers 
455 feet away
for mickey s
491st home run

  come  senators
and congressmen  
  please
heed the call  
  don t stand
in the doorway  
  don t lock up
the hall  
  for the times 
they are a changin    
there s absolutely
no question 
the first cavalry division
is the latest concept
in mobile warfare 
one division is worth
21 2 russian
and 6 chinese divisions 
how well will
the individual soldier
stand up here
in vietnam 
what do you think 
dad  about that 
i don t know 
13 000 miles   
that s a long way to go
to fight a war 
they fought the french
and the japanese
for 30 years 
can they
be weeded out 
anything
that lives in a cave
can be weeded out 
i just hope they send you
to europe or korea or   
they can t 
someplace safe 
every marine has
a tour of duty there 
it s not like the army 
what s wrong with you 
you served 
uncle bob served

ronnie 
you re doing
the right thing 
communism has
to be stopped 
it s god s will
you go 
we re proud of you 
be careful 
that s all 
up there in hanoi

means to me  dad 
ever since
i was a kid 
i ve wanted
to serve my country 
and i want to go 
i want to go
to vietnam

the attitude of people
on the home front

can the south vietnamese
government
stand up
to the north 
we wouldn t
be here

the eyes   
the voice  the way
they look at you 
i know  but people here 
they don t give a shit
about the war

kicked out of us 
what do you mean  we  
you were in college 
it was you who bought
that communist bullshit 
yeah  they were going
to take over the world 
do you remember that 
finnelli  you  walsh 
the whole town
was devastated 
for what 
for lies 
for bullshit lies 
they burn the flag 
they demonstrate
against us
on the cover
of the paper today 
they have no respect 
they have no idea
what s going on
over there
and the men that are
sacrificing their lives 
nobody here
seems to care 
it s a bunch
of goddamned shit 
don t take the lord s name in vain
in front of the children 
i agree with
everything you say 
i served my country 
they just want
to take from it 
love it or leave it 
the other side s angry
because
we re not winning 
how can we win 
tommy 
what s the matter 
nothing 
anybody listening here 
tommy 
what 
tommy s going
to fail english 
he doesn t believe
in the war 
what 
he thinks we re doing
the wrong thing
over there 
he thinks
it s all a mistake 
mistake  what s this 
spit it out 
you believe
in demonstrators 
huh  what 
i just don t agree
with everything you re saying 
i don t think
you understand 
what does
tommy know 
i don t understand 
he s hanging around
with longhairs
who take drugs 
that s not the reason 
have they ever worked 
you want to burn the flag 
huh  tommy 
what is this 
you want to
bring down this country 
love it
or leave it  tommy 
all they re
trying to say  ronnie

where were they when
their country needed them 
you served your country 
what did you
get out of it

in americanism 
but most of all 
i believe in victory
for america 
some people are starting
to say the war is wrong 
that we shouldn t be there 
some people would like to
tear our country down 
but who are the kids
defending their right
to protest 
these are the kids
who care about america 
kids who have respect
for their flag
and their parents
and their government
and their religion 
kids like joey walsh 
he was the first 
we got a street
in the park named after him 
and danny topinka 
billy vorsovich 
phil and larry powell 
tommy finnelli 
six boys from massapequa   
and they all knew
what honor  duty 
and sacrifice meant 
they paid
the highest price 
they died for it 
this town s
been hit hard 
it s always
been hit hard 
doc here  he was
in the first war 
a lot of us here
were in the second 
that s why
we can t give up 
that s why we re going to
win in vietnam 
because massapequa s
been there before 
because of those
six wonderful boys 
and because of him 
ron   
come say a few words 
would you  please 
ron kovic 
ladies and gentlemen 
he was born
on the 4th of july  1946 
give him a big hand
on his great birthday 
i just want to say
for the guys in vietnam
that we re doing our best 
it s not an easy situation 
but the boys  morale
over there is real high 
and you can feel
confident that we are   
we are going to
win that war 
i served my country 
and i don t want you
to feel sorry for me 
do not shed a tear 
i have my hands 
my eyes  my ears   
i have my heart   
and i have   
what i feel   
i have what i feel is   
an unquen    quenchable

thanks for  uh 
for seeing me 
any friend of billy s
is a friend of ours 
well  uh  why don t you
come on in the house 
my wife fixed some chicken 
if n you want some 
yes  sir  it was
a real nice funeral 
marine honor guard came
all the way down from atlanta
in their fancy uniforms 
fired their rifles
up in the sky 
thank you 
the drums was beating 
 course it was nothing
like the big war
100 years ago
down here 
but there was billy
and bruce    bruce crabtree   
andy henderson 
and the rutledge boy 
lance 
yeah  lance 
he was a nice boy 
for the life of me 
i still can t quite
figure that war out 
why we had to go
all that dang way to fight it
and why s we had to lose
so many young men 
can t figure it out 
but we got a proud tradition
here in this town 
billy s great grandfather
was at the first bull run 
my pa was
over in france in  18 
don t forget  you were
over in the pacific in  44 
guadalcanal 
is that right 
yeah  well  i guess
this family s fought
in every war that  uh 
this country s ever had 
i reckon we re ready
to do it again
if n we have to 
 course they never did know
what done happened and all 
there was a letter
from a colonel 
i think it was 
colonel moore 
that s right 
colonel moore 
he said there was
a bad ambush one night 
said that billy distinguished himself
in the fighting 
he also told us that
billy died real quick 
that s good
that he died quick 
i was
his squad leader 
i didn t know billy
real well 
he was new 
kind of quiet 
we didn t talk much
to new guys 
he was 19 
is that right 
that s right  19 
only son 
yes  sir 
my only boy 
i think he said
he was married
and you were pregnant 
i remember
the day he was killed 
uh    it was
a strange day 
we were out on patrol
near a beach area   
and  oh 
it was very confusing 
there was screaming
and firing 
uh   
it was getting late 
and there were these
children  uh   
these babies   
that we killed
by mistake 
how awful 
and then it   
got really crazy 
and we had to pull back
because the nva
were coming up on us 
and we got scattered
in the dunes 
people were yelling
at anything 
firing at anything 
and that was when it   
it happened 
i was  uh  confused   
scared 
i raised my rifle
three times   
and    shots   
the body fell
in the dunes 
god  this is   
this is very difficult
for me to say 
we don t have
to hear this  ron 
but i think i was the one
that killed your son 
i was the one 
i was the one 
i was the one 
what s done
is done  sir 
i can t ever
forgive you   
but maybe the lord can 
we understand  ron 
we understand the pain
you ve been going through
