you may call me azeem 
robin of locksley 
kindest sir   
it is rumored you fought
in king richard s crusade   
with my beloved son robin 
i fear you have returned home
to desperate times   
when dark forces
plot against our absent king 
i am anxious for word of my son 
were you present at his capture
near jerusalem 
do you know which potentate holds him 
does he still bear me ill will 
a little news  please  sir 
i would give all i own for his release 
help me 
you should have waited 
i m sorry you were disturbed  master 
it s all right  let him go 
they ve taken my gwen  my daughter 
who 
men  on horses  in masks 
we tried to stop them 
my son   is dead 
master  stay 
there is an evil moon tonight 
never fear  duncan  good will overcome 
trust in that 
i m sorry  my lord  i had no choice 
you 
the king shall hear of this 
join us 
never 
join us   
or die 
god and king richard 
thank you  lord 
i m home 
i m home 
you are strange  christian 
but i m free 
i beg you to free yourself of your vow 
return with the boat 
i know how it feels to be far
from home and family 
because i love them so much 
i cannot dishonor them 
i thought you d say that 
no man controls my destiny 
especially not one who attacks downwind
and stinks of garlic 
come 
our fighting days are done 
by nightfall  we ll celebrate with my father 
you understand  of course   
i had to try 
i would have succeeded 
why must you walk in back of me 
in your country  am i not the infidel 
it seems safer to appear as your slave
rather than your equal 
for an infidel you have uncommon clarity
of thinking 
tell me of yourself 
your name  azeem  what does it mean 
great one 
really  did you give yourself this name 
it s a joke 
azeem the great one  i am home 
look 
mistletoe 
many a maid has lost her resolve to me
thanks to this 
in my country  we talk to our women 
we do not drug them with plants 
what do you know of women 
where i come from  christian   
there are women of such beauty
they can possess a man s mind so   
that he would willingly die for them 
wait  is that why you were
to be executed 
because of a woman 
that s it  isn t it 
that s it 
it is close to sunset 
you painted old dog  who was she 
the mullah s daughter 
another man s wife 
what s her name 
is there no sun in this cursed country 
which way is east 
  her name 
  east 
her name 
jasmina 
that way 
you are sure 
i d know blindfolded 
i m five miles from home 
was she worth it 
worth dying for 
you re dog s meat  son 
you re not playing by the rules 
deer don t climb trees 
perhaps he thinks he s a game bird 
shall we teach him to fly 
cut it down 
hold 
what manner of creature is so fearsome
it takes six men to attack it 
stand down  it s no affair of yours 
have we treed the devil 
let s see 
a small boy  a truly dangerous animal 
this boy killed one of the sheriff
of nottingham s deer 
you starve us  we needed the meat 
i advise you to move on 
this is the sheriff s land 
wrong 
it s my land and my tree 
whatever s in it belongs to me 
might i have the pleasure of your name
before i have you run through 
robin of locksley 
welcome home 
kill him 
time to redeem that vow 
unleash the hounds 
get off your damn knees 
be so kind as to give me your name
before i run you through 
guy of gisborne  the sheriff s cousin 
that bastard poached deer 
poached 
isn t it a greater crime to starve a family 
go on  locksley 
go on 
i ve seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes 
get off my land 
tell nottingham what happens
when his scum pick on children 
you travel 10 000 miles to save my life
then leave me to be butchered 
i fulfill my vows when i choose 
which does not include prayer times   
or anytime i m outnumbered six to one 
you whine like a mule 
you are still alive 
have no fear  come down 
is it true  did you kill a deer 
hundreds 
you scared him 
interesting place  this   
england 
the sheriff s not to be disturbed 
cousin 
i trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value 
i met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people 
who told you to cover up 
his name 
robin of locksley 
the prodigal son returns 
he s a whelp  this girl could best him 
put it there 
this  whelp  bested four of my men 
your men were probably drunk 
yet you survived  cousin 
i barely survived 
his companion is dark skinned 
with a marked face of islam 
he carries a saracen sword 
i m sure it would take an army
to match these rogues 
i trust locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning 
father 
father  anyone here 
duncan 
father 
no 
who is it 
my father 
who s there 
who s there 
master robin 
is that you 
duncan 
praise be  i thought god   
had abandoned us 
duncan  my father   
it s a miracle 
why didn t you cut him down 
are you deaf 
easy 
look at him 
i would have done if i could see 
who did this to you 
guy  guy of gisborne 
the sheriff and his witch watched 
why 
they say the sheriff captured your father
worshipping the devil 
that he signed a confession
before the bishop 
that s not possible 
nottingham declared
all locksley lands forfeit 
did you believe the charges 
not even when they took my eyes 
we must go 
he loved you to the end 
he never gave up hope of your return 
i should have been here 
he called the crusades a foolish quest 
he said it was vanity to force others
to our religion 
but you must flee now 
head south to safety 
gisborne will surely seek revenge 
i hear you  duncan 
you should go home 
my world is turned upside down here 
i cannot ask you to come with me 
alone  christian 
you will only get yourself killed 
besides   
there is nothing left
for me to go home to 
i will not rest until my father is avenged 
i swear it   
by my own blood 
mortianna 
you called  madam 
what do you see 
  the son of a dead man 
  locksley 
does he affect us 
he precedes the lionheart 
king richard returns from the crusades 
it would soften the barons  spines 
  soon 
  make haste 
but my plan is still intact 
what s wrong 
i have seen our death 
the painted man  he haunts my dreams 
adorned with strange foreign markings 
locksley s companion 
kill him 
kill them both 
what is this place 
peter s home 
it s nearly six years since we left together 
we ll find food and shelter here 
no beggars 
tell the mistress robin of locksley s
at her door 
her ladyship s not here 
is the child marian in 
maybe she is  maybe she isn t 
the hospitality here is as warm
as the weather 
  it s a joke 
  really 
leave your weapons 
just you 
wait here 
right here 
a curse on moors and saracens 
were it not for their ungodly ways
master robin would never have left 
what manner of name is  azeem  
irish  cornish 
moorish 
who are you 
robin of locksley 
you lie  robin is dead 
step into the light 
turn around 
am i to dance next 
who are you 
i am the maid marian 
show yourself 
for we knew each other well 
the years have   
been kind 
thank you 
we must guard against outlaws
who would kidnap a relative of the king 
you can see i am not one of those 
perhaps 
now remove yourself from here 
i would  but i m sworn to protect you 
protect me 
robin of locksley was nothing
but a spoiled bully 
besides  as you can see 
we have enough protection 
marian  wait 
you are truly courageous
against an unarmed man 
point me toward danger  i m ready 
hello  marian 
his last thoughts were of you 
oh  peter 
i m sorry  marian 
i m sorry 
how do i know you didn t abandon him
to save yourself 
no one feels his loss more than i 
next time i m in london 
i ll give my mother your condolences 
i would think for your safety
you would join her 
i have no interest in life at court 
all gossip mongering and currying favor 
but you re alone here 
hardly 
these years have left us many in need 
while you and my brother played hero 
nottingham plundered the shire 
you still have your lands 
i give them no excuse to take them 
i am the king s cousin  i must look after
these people until his return 
my purpose in coming was not to hurt you 
i swore to your brother
i would protect you 
you cannot replace my brother 
i don t want to replace him 
i return to find my home destroyed
and my father murdered 
the only explanations for it
are the ramblings of an old  blind man 
all i remember of you is a spoiled bully   
who used to burn my hair as a child 
please allow that years of war and prison
may change a man 
whatever happened between you
and your father  you mustn t believe   
what they accused him of 
i don t 
look 
how did your uneducated kind
ever take jerusalem 
god knows 
what is it 
  what is it 
  nottingham s soldiers 
here  is this your protection 
i killed some of the sheriff s men 
i fear i have placed you in danger 
i can take care of myself  just go 
no  that s my horse 
a magnificent animal 
  go 
  i m sworn to protect you 
no more boyish gestures 
i m not leaving 
stop them  they re stealing my horses 
you re so kind 
sheltering outlaws 
they re thieves 
lucky he didn t steal your virtue 
a crown to the man
who brings me locksley s head 
have we lost them 
no 
my horse carries two  yours is lame 
we can t outrun them 
leave me  master robin 
i slow your escape 
we ll lose them in the forest 
sherwood forest is haunted 
we take our chances with the ghosts 
or become ghosts ourselves 
come on 
there re only three of them 
it s not the men we fear 
it s the evil spirits 
robin of the hood 
son of a devil worshipper 
your father died a coward   
cursing you and squealing
like a stuck pig 
you ll bring no justice
to your father by dying 
there are your ghosts 
wind chimes 
a child s toy put to good use 
you scare easily  my painted moor 
this forest has eyes 
i swear it 
in my dreams alone
have i imagined such a place 
then imagine a way to cross it 
there s hope 
 there was a rich man from nottingham
who tried to cross the river
 what a dope
he tripped on a rope
 now look at him shiver  
beg for mercy  rich man 
i beg of no man 
this is our river  and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax 
i will pay no tax 
as you can see  i have nothing 
not even my sword 
bollocks 
any man who travels with two servants   
and claims he s got no money is either   
a fool or a liar 
yeah  he s a liar 
who are you 
john little   
bestman of the woods 
well  bestman  you lead this rabble 
yes  i do  mate 
and if you want to travel through
sherwood forest  it ll cost you   
that gold medallion 
it s sacred to me 
it s sacred to us too  matey 
it will feed us for a month 
you must fight me for it 
love to  mate 
be careful  father 
he walloped 12 of the sheriff s men 
is that so 
reckon i ll enjoy this 
he s your father 
help me 
he s drowning 
lost something 
thanks for the taxes 
the little rich boy s lost for words 
any great ideas 
get up  move faster 
 move faster   great idea 
we re not through yet 
all right  my old cocker 
you want another good walloping 
you ll have it 
i ve made it past the gate  john little 
or should i call you  little john  
swimming time again  old chum 
where is he  do you see him 
it s a bloody shame 
he was a brave lad 
  do you yield 
  i can t bloody swim 
  do you yield 
  yes 
good  now put your feet down 
i ll be buggered 
  the medallion 
  give me your name first 
robin of locksley 
well  robin of locksley   
you got balls of solid rock  come on 
that s much  the miller s son 
harold brownwell   
that stumpy one is david of doncaster 
but the lads call him  bull  
because you re short 
it s because i m so long 
save it 
save it for the ladies 
give him some mead 
i made that myself 
has english hospitality changed so
in six years   
that a friend of mine s not welcome 
but he s a savage  sire 
that he is 
but no more than you or i 
and don t call me  sire  
with regret  i must decline 
allah forbids it 
your loss 
why are so many of you in hiding 
we re all outlaws 
got prices on our heads 
even the lad 
he s a blasted sheriff 
he says we owe him taxes 
your ghost will only keep his men
at bay so long 
they ve worked so far 
you have a better idea 
we can fight back 
did i crack your noble head 
these are all good lads here   
with hearts of oak  but they re farmers 
it d be lambs to the slaughter 
they say the sheriff was raised by a witch 
she knows every man s thoughts 
  she flies 
  that s codswallop 
the rich son of a devil worshipper   
cares what happens to outlaw peasants 
my lord was kind and generous 
who dares believe him capable 
my father was no devil worshipper 
i ll have words with any man
who says otherwise 
but he s right 
i was a rich man s son 
but i killed the sheriff s men 
so i m an outlaw like you 
you are nothing like us 
that s will scarlet 
take no notice  he s full of piss and wind 
come on  drink up 
stop talking so much rubbish 
this is the best we simple men can expect 
here we re safe 
here we are kings 
too much mead  friend 
forgive me  i overslept 
rest yourself 
what day is it 
sunday  i think 
do they still give alms
to the poor at mass 
that they do 
now the need for mercy
is greater than ever 
we beseech thy blessing  lord   
on all your people  but most especially   
on our noble sheriff of nottingham 
grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect   
our glorious city 
grant him also the strength   
to bring to justice the lawless men   
who would threaten its safety   
and prosperity   and the judgment   
to punish them   
in your name  amen 
go in peace 
that s all i have 
alms for a blind man  milady 
for one who cannot see your beauty 
what are you doing here 
searching my soul 
i do not wish to be seen with an outlaw 
you prefer nottingham s company 
  there s a price on your head 
  how much 
one hundred gold pieces 
is that all 
i shall have to annoy the sheriff more 
soon it will be 1 000 
for 1 000  i d turn you in myself 
nottingham is mounting an army 
he has every blacksmith in the county
making swords and armor 
  what s his plan 
  i don t know 
there s no limit to his ambitions 
  thank you 
  quickly  go 
do something for me 
take a bath 
a bath 
these are my private chambers  my son 
i have priests who would hear
your confession 
i see the boy i knew in the man before me 
welcome home  robin 
you shine like the sun  milady 
you ve been meeting with robin 
my cousin tells me the knave deprived you
of some horses 
yes  a most disagreeable experience 
and for inflicting that upon you   
i ll hang him from the walls
by his entrails 
i d like to see that 
if you d bring your household within
the city  i could attend to your needs 
thank you  but i prefer to stay
in my family s home for now 
then perhaps you d do me the honor   
of accepting a token
of my undying devotion to your safety 
king richard will be moved to hear
of your concern for my welfare 
i m afraid the king has many enemies
abroad and at home 
i fear for his safe return 
fear not  dear sheriff  he will return 
and when he does  he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects 
i asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one 
because his answer vexed me
so grievously 
he said   
he must meet god
with a clear conscience 
you lie 
on your souls  do not shed blood
in the house of god 
locksley 
i ll cut your heart out   
with a spoon 
then it begins 
close that gate 
what are you looking at 
water 
  thank you 
  for the animal 
how can i protect you
if i know not where you go 
you hardly raise a finger
when you do know   
great one 
i prefer to have the choice 
you ve stolen the sheriff s horse 
you ve stirred up a hornet s nest now 
  are you afraid 
  yeah  a little 
so is the sheriff  and today
i gave him a sting he ll not forget 
you fool  you started a war 
we re already at war 
bread 
i say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes   
and hunts our children 
you planning to join us 
no  to lead you 
these are simple people 
they are not warriors 
be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes 
you forget yourself  i do not ask
for your company or council 
why a spoon  cousin  why not an axe 
because it s dull  you twit  it ll hurt more 
i want this brigand found 
starve them out 
slaughter their     no  take their livestock 
i want locksley s own people fighting
to bring his head in 
perhaps we could create a name for him 
something to drive fear into the populace 
maybe  locksley the lethal 
or  wreaking robin  
i want him dead by the full moon 
before the barons come back 
now  sew 
and keep the stitches small 
he s not here 
where s your mate  the man called little 
  he died last winter 
  burn it down 
leave the sow  her young
will feed us through winter 
you ve heard of the sherwood bandit 
robin of the hood  yes 
pray he is brought to us before winter 
over here 
they burned it  all of it 
there 
look what they ve done 
if it s fame you seek  christian   
i think you have it 
you brought this misery on us  locksley 
nottingham is trying to divide us 
we are divided  rich boy 
i m not as blind as that old man 
you re still trying to be lord of the manor 
i heard the sheriff now values your neck   
at 500 gold pieces 
i say we take him in 
you think the sheriff will give everything
back after i m gone 
he ll give us the reward and our pardons 
wrong 
he ll stretch your necks one by one 
what would you have us do 
fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and bare hands 
if needs be 
but with the one true weapon
that escapes you 
courage 
look out 
thank you  wulf 
you wish to end this 
you wish to go home 
then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves   
and face that the price may be dear 
i would rather die   
than spend my life in hiding 
the sheriff calls us outlaws 
but i say we are free 
and one free man defending his home
is more powerful   
than ten hired soldiers 
the crusades taught me that 
i ll make no promises save one 
if you truly believe in your hearts
that you are free   
then we can win 
they got armor 
they got armor  bull 
even this boy can learn
to find the chinks in armor 
but we ain t got no food 
what do we need that the forest
cannot provide  we have food 
wood for weapons 
we ll find safety in the trees 
what about our kin 
sheriff took all they got 
then  by god  we take it back 
what s the meaning of this 
a woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations 
how dare you 
please don t take that  don t take that 
they belong to our lord 
now they belong to my lord sheriff 
give it back 
good 
tell the sheriff for every harm he does
these people i will repay him tenfold 
something vexes thee 
what the devil 
it s a hot day  friend   
to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse 
the sheriff will hear of this 
i truly hope so 
buy yourself a new sow 
god bless you  fanny 
and god bless robin hood 
we reckon he s nicked   
three to four million
in the last five months 
raise the bounty on his head 
25 000 crowns 
begging your pardon  it won t do no good   
how much you raise it 
why is that 
because of the poor 
he gives them what he takes 
well  sire   they love him 
just a minute 
robin hood steals money
from my pocket   
forcing me to hurt the public   
and they love him for it 
yes 
cancel the food scraps
for lepers and orphans 
no more merciful beheadings 
and call off christmas 
the treasury is empty 
day and night people plague my door   
whining for tax relief and safe passage
through sherwood forest 
 we can t pay thee
what the highwayman s taken  
it s the shortest route to london 
it s the only route to london 
sir guy s patrols have found nothing  sire 
no camp  nothing 
this hooded viper simply slithers
into the forest 
you  my room  10 30 tonight 
you  10 45 
and bring a friend 
 what s the pleasure in this life
laughter  love and drinking
 good king richard  bless his soul
loves his wine and warring
 but for us who stay at home
 there s only beer and whoring 
how many 
twenty 
how many 
five 
they can t count 
why scare them 
and they call me a barbarian 
quiet 
it will be difficult to sing
with a sword in your gullet 
yes  my lord 
shut up and help me move this log 
this is a tree  not a log 
shut up and help me 
i have to meet a girl 
men in front  after me 
the rest stay with the wagon 
on to glory

in mysterious ways 
i accept

and glory to his bounty   
by learning about   
beer 
are you bragging 
this is blood money  marian 
intended to bribe king richard s enemies
to unite against him 
we intercepted it 
who would   
nottingham 
nottingham would not challenge the king 
the king s not here to be challenged 
while he s away he may lose his country 
you thought i was keeping it all 
didn t you 
a contribution to your cause 
  keep it 
  it will fetch a great price 
it s not dear to me 
it is 
it s not 
i m saying everything wrong 
cheers 
how do i get down 
wait 
we don t go that way anymore 
i m happy to hear that 
grab on 
we have a rule here 
once someone has seen the way
to our camp  that person cannot leave 
too many lives are at stake 
that s why sarah and i were blindfolded 
will you join us for dinner 
perhaps 
salaam  little one 
did god paint you 
did god paint me 
for certain 
why 
because   
allah loves wondrous variety 
how is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman   
has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth 
i ve seen knights panic
at the first hint of battle 
and i ve seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body   
to defend a dying horse 
nobility s not a birthright 
it s defined by one s actions 
it s interesting to hear you say that 
i didn t 
my father did 
did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him 
i don t know 
all i know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger 
i was lost after my mother died 
my father too  and for a short time
he found comfort   
with another woman 
a peasant woman 
i felt he betrayed my mother s memory 
he gave her up 
for the love of a 12 year old boy
who would never forgive him 
who says i m content 
i have my plans for the future 
a grander scheme than this 
no  a simpler one 
a home   family   
love 
men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose 
when it doesn t   tis a burden to them 
robin of the hood   
prince of thieves   
is he capable of love 
father 
it s mother  she s dying 
your baby has not turned 
it cannot be born without help 
he s the devil s seed sent to lead us astray 
he ll kill her 
if you do not listen to me   
she will die  and the child 
the friar s done all he can 
i suggest you let the moor try 
so be it 
then be it on your head 
get me a needle  thread  water 
hurry 
come with me  john 
what will you do 
i ve seen it many times 
with horses 
with horses 
bite down 
help me 
it will be all right 
i tell you  john  the barbarian is killing her 
out of the way  boy 
quick  take him 
what is it 
your son  milady 
you truly are a great one 
my son 
look at the lovely little baby 
isn t he wonderful 
the lord has taught me a fine lesson 
though i may think i am godly 
i am not worldly 
please 
my barbarian friend  let s open a barrel
and try to save each other s souls 
alas  i am not permitted 
fine  you talk  i ll drink 
may i have this dance 
this lady is spoken for 
why this way 
so you cannot return
or be forced to tell others the way 
it was good to see you  marian 
it was good to be seen 
i have two favors to ask 
one 
take duncan with you 
i fear for his health 
and i m tired of his bellyaching 
you wish me to leave 
old friend  listen to me 
take marian safely home 
i fear for her safety 
of course  sire 
two 
you re king richard s cousin 
you can get word to him
of nottingham s plan 
he would believe you 
if the sheriff found out  i d lose all i have 
that s true 
do it for your king 
no 
i ll do it for you 
he fancies you  milady 
i am blind  but some things i can still see 
in ten days  the barons are coming 
robin hood stole what i was to pay
for their allegiance 
i am surrounded by fools
who do not realize my obligations 
tell me  mortianna   
am i thwarted 
recruit the beasts that share our god 
animals 
from the north 
you mean  celts 
they drink the blood of the dead 
yoke their strength 
hired thugs 
brilliant 
put thine own issue on the throne 
a child  how 
ally with royal blood 
who 
it s a personal matter  my lord 
but of vital importance 
i understand  milady 
this is my most trusted emissary 
he must travel to france immediately
and give this personally to the king 
my lady in waiting will accompany you 
my dear  i could not vouch for her safety 
the journey is full of danger 
i appreciate your concern  but sarah s
a skilled rider and i insist she go 
as you wish 
what s wrong 
my horse is favoring his foreleg 
duncan  is that you 
hello 
rebecca 
nicodemus  go 
find mice 
i ve never seen a noblewoman s breasts 
we couldn t hold them  milady 
someone wants a word with you 
easy 
tonight i need your eyes  old friend 
it s the warning arrow 
all is well  it s duncan 
what happened 
i found you  thank god  i did it 
  nottingham s men attacked us 
  marian 
they took her 
what is it 
over there  look 
on the hill 
allah  be merciful 
to the trees 
to the trees 
they re coming 
the old fool led them straight to us 
get me prisoners 
children 
come to me 
my god 
save yourselves 
we better go  robin  now 
this way  my lambs  come on 
hold your fire 
gold  gold  it s gold 
fanny

no  fanny  i won t leave you 
go on  john 
  hold the rope 
  i ve got it 
john  catch her 
i got you  girl 
quick 
come on 
go on 
don t wait for me 
john  go on 
hurry 
corpus christi 
amen 
my lady marian 
by what right do you keep me prisoner 
you misunderstand my intentions 
you ve been brought here
for your own protection 
protection from whom 
from yourself 
it seems you ve been consorting
with outlaws 
where do you hear such lies 
by your own hand  milady 
i m sorry  my child 
i feared you were being led astray 
come 
it s over 
today i return justice to this land 
i shall hang the ringleaders 
of course  but   
i ll be generous and give you the lives
of the woodsmen and their families 
the children 
and  of course   
your traitorous lady in waiting 
as a wedding gift 
and just whom am i supposed to marry 
search your heart  my child 
why not a union
with the house of nottingham   
and heal the wounds in our land 
only one man can heal the wounds
of this land 
robin hood 
i m truly sorry  milady 
he wasted his life 
how many lives would you waste 
what a beautiful child 
so young 
so alive  so unaware
of how precarious life can be 
i had a very sad childhood 
i ll tell you about it sometime 
i never knew my parents 
it s amazing i m sane 
our bonding would allow these children
to grow up as my allies 
you understand   
i cannot allow them to grow up
as my enemies 
i have no choice 
that s true 
look 
christian 
i have heard that robin hood
may still be alive 
either tell me where he may be hiding   
or we ll hang you  catch him anyway 
and do the same to him 
i d love to kill him for you 
so he is alive  then 
i m not really sure 
then why would i need you 
because  my lord  if he is alive
i can get close to him 
i m one of his men 
he d never suspect me 
  he knows you hate him 
  shut up 
he s a trusting fool 
and if he doesn t believe me  he ll kill me   
then you ve lost nothing 
if you fail   
i will personally remove
your lying tongue 
my pride brought us to this 
it s you who gave pride to these people 
i was a fool 
a fool to let him leave   
to believe i planned it so perfectly 
a wise man once said 
 there are no perfect men in this world   
    only perfect intentions  
you were an honor
to your countrymen today 
you fought better
than twenty english knights 
  i thought you were taken 
  i was 
how d you escape 
traitor 
i ll wring your scrawny neck 
get in there 
nobody escapes the sheriff
unless he s lining his pockets 
where s my son 
i ll have your hide  you toad 
bugger me 
let him speak 
i bring a message   
from nottingham 
our men are to be hung in the square
at high noon tomorrow 
and my boy 
the boy too 
ten men in all 
the hangings are part of the celebration   
for the sheriff s marriage 
to whom 
lady marian 
a bride of royal blood 
and with king richard gone   
he ll be after the throne 
you were to use this news to get near me 
then kill me  right 
what are your intentions 
it depends on you  locksley 
i ve never trusted you  that s no secret 
will you finish what you started 
or will he run like the spoiled rich boy
i always took him for 
did i wrong you in another life 
will scarlet 
where does this hatred for me come from 
from knowing that   
our father loved you best 
our father 
we are brothers 
i m the son of the woman who replaced
your dead mother for a time 
  your anger drove them apart 
  it s a lie 
it s not a lie  you ruined my life 
i have more reason to hate you
than anyone 
but i dared to believe in you 
what i must know  brother   
is will you stay with us
and finish what you started 
i have a brother 
i have a brother 
i will make my stand with you 
side by side 
to the end 
to the end 
we re all in 
daft buggers 
we finish this 
what was that 
truly  you are a wizard 
the mystery is in the black powder 
surely the lord will grant us victory 
you ll be by the gate
to cut off reinforcements 
john  you sit on this wall
to protect our escape 
i will hide below the scaffold   
to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal 
no  i ll do that 
you cover us with your bow 
it s too dangerous 
so is your aim 
whatever azeem is concocting 
we must each be in place for it 
now our success depends on total concert 
  we may be only six men   
  seven 
  what  where s the little ones 
  safe with my mother 
you cracked  you d get hurt 
i ve had eight babies 
don t tell me about getting hurt 
anyway  i won t just sit
and let one of them die 
you should be bloody well minding
the other seven 
tell her  rob 
you will take position here 
no blades  no bows 
leave your weapons here 
no blades  no bows 
leave your weapons here
