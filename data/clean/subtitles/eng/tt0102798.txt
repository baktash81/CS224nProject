robin of locksley
kindest sir
it is rumored you fought
in king richards crusade
with my beloved son robin
i fear you have returned home
to desperate times
when dark forces
plot against our absent king
i am anxious for word of my son
were you present at his capture
near jerusalem
do you know which potentate holds him
does he still bear me ill will
a little news please sir
i would give all i own for his release
help me
you should have waited
im sorry you were disturbed master
its all right let him go
theyve taken my gwen my daughter
who
men on horses in masks
we tried to stop them
my sonis dead
master stay
there is an evil moon tonight
never fear duncan good will overcome
trust in that
im sorry my lord i had no choice
you
the king shall hear of this
join us
never
join us
or die
god and king richard
thank you lord
im home
im home
you are strange christian
but im free
i beg you to free yourself of your vow
return with the boat
i know how it feels to be far
from home and family
because i love them so much
i cannot dishonor them
i thought youd say that
no man controls my destiny
especially not one who attacks downwind
and stinks of garlic
come
our fighting days are done
by nightfall well celebrate with my father
you understand of course
i had to try
i would have succeeded
why must you walk in back of me
in your country am i not the infidel
it seems safer to appear as your slave
rather than your equal
for an infidel you have uncommon clarity
of thinking
tell me of yourself
your name azeem what does it mean
great one
really did you give yourself this name
its a joke
azeem the great one i am home
look
mistletoe
many a maid has lost her resolve to me
thanks to this
in my country we talk to our women
we do not drug them with plants
what do you know of women
where i come from christian
there are women of such beauty
they can possess a mans mind so
that he would willingly die for them
wait is that why you were
to be executed
because of a woman
thats it isnt it
thats it
it is close to sunset
you painted old dog who was she
the mullahs daughter
another mans wife
whats her name
is there no sun in this cursed country
which way is east
her name
east
her name
jasmina
that way
you are sure
id know blindfolded
im five miles from home
was she worth it
worth dying for
youre dogs meat son
youre not playing by the rules
deer dont climb trees
perhaps he thinks hes a game bird
shall we teach him to fly
cut it down
hold
what manner of creature is so fearsome
it takes six men to attack it
stand down its no affair of yours
have we treed the devil
lets see
a small boy a truly dangerous animal
this boy killed one of the sheriff
of nottinghams deer
you starve us we needed the meat
i advise you to move on
this is the sheriffs land
wrong
its my land and my tree
whatevers in it belongs to me
might i have the pleasure of your name
before i have you run through
robin of locksley
welcome home
kill him
time to redeem that vow
unleash the hounds
get off your damn knees
be so kind as to give me your name
before i run you through
guy of gisborne the sheriffs cousin
that bastard poached deer
poached
isnt it a greater crime to starve a family
go on locksley
go on
ive seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes
get off my land
tell nottingham what happens
when his scum pick on children
you travel 10000 miles to save my life
then leave me to be butchered
i fulfill my vows when i choose
which does not include prayer times
or anytime im outnumbered six to one
you whine like a mule
you are still alive
have no fear come down
is it true did you kill a deer
hundreds
you scared him
interesting place this
england
the sheriffs not to be disturbed
cousin
i trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value
i met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people
who told you to cover up
his name
robin of locksley
the prodigal son returns
hes a whelp this girl could best him
put it there
this whelp bested four of my men
your men were probably drunk
yet you survived cousin
i barely survived
his companion is darkskinned
with a marked face of islam
he carries a saracen sword
im sure it would take an army
to match these rogues
i trust locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning
father
father anyone here
duncan
father
no
who is it
my father
whos there
whos there
master robin
is that you
duncan
praise be i thought god
had abandoned us
duncan my father
its a miracle
why didnt you cut him down
are you deaf
easy
look at him
i would have done if i could see
who did this to you
guy guy of gisborne
the sheriff and his witch watched
why
they say the sheriff captured your father
worshipping the devil
that he signed a confession
before the bishop
thats not possible
nottingham declared
all locksley lands forfeit
did you believe the charges
not even when they took my eyes
we must go
he loved you to the end
he never gave up hope of your return
i should have been here
he called the crusades a foolish quest
he said it was vanity to force others
to our religion
but you must flee now
head south to safety
gisborne will surely seek revenge
i hear you duncan
you should go home
my world is turned upside down here
i cannot ask you to come with me
alone christian
you will only get yourself killed
besides
there is nothing left
for me to go home to
i will not rest until my father is avenged
i swear it
by my own blood
mortianna
you called madam
what do you see
the son of a dead man
locksley
does he affect us
he precedes the lionheart
king richard returns from the crusades
it would soften the barons spines
soon
make haste
but my plan is still intact
whats wrong
i have seen our death
the painted man he haunts my dreams
adorned with strange foreign markings
locksleys companion
kill him
kill them both
what is this place
peters home
its nearly six years since we left together
well find food and shelter here
no beggars
tell the mistress robin of locksleys
at her door
her ladyships not here
is the child marian in
maybe she is maybe she isnt
the hospitality here is as warm
as the weather
its a joke
really
leave your weapons
just you
wait here
right here
a curse on moors and saracens
were it not for their ungodly ways
master robin would never have left
what manner of name is azeem
irish cornish
moorish
who are you
robin of locksley
you lie robin is dead
step into the light
turn around
am i to dance next
who are you
i am the maid marian
show yourself
for we knew each other well
the years have
been kind
thank you
we must guard against outlaws
who would kidnap a relative of the king
you can see i am not one of those
perhaps
now remove yourself from here
i would but im sworn to protect you
protect me
robin of locksley was nothing
but a spoiled bully
besides as you can see
we have enough protection
marian wait
you are truly courageous
against an unarmed man
point me toward danger im ready
hello marian
his last thoughts were of you
oh peter
im sorry marian
im sorry
how do i know you didnt abandon him
to save yourself
no one feels his loss more than i
next time im in london
ill give my mother your condolences
i would think for your safety
you would join her
i have no interest in life at court
all gossipmongering and currying favor
but youre alone here
hardly
these years have left us many in need
while you and my brother played hero
nottingham plundered the shire
you still have your lands
i give them no excuse to take them
i am the kings cousin i must look after
these people until his return
my purpose in coming was not to hurt you
i swore to your brother
i would protect you
you cannot replace my brother
i dont want to replace him
i return to find my home destroyed
and my father murdered
the only explanations for it
are the ramblings of an old blind man
all i remember of you is a spoiled bully
who used to burn my hair as a child
please allow that years of war and prison
may change a man
whatever happened between you
and your father you mustnt believe
what they accused him of
i dont
look
how did your uneducated kind
ever take jerusalem
god knows
what is it
what is it
nottinghams soldiers
here is this your protection
i killed some of the sheriffs men
i fear i have placed you in danger
i can take care of myself just go
no thats my horse
a magnificent animal
go
im sworn to protect you
no more boyish gestures
im not leaving
stop them theyre stealing my horses
youre so kind
sheltering outlaws
theyre thieves
lucky he didnt steal your virtue
a crown to the man
who brings me locksleys head
have we lost them
no
my horse carries two yours is lame
we cant outrun them
leave me master robin
i slow your escape
well lose them in the forest
sherwood forest is haunted
we take our chances with the ghosts
or become ghosts ourselves
come on
therere only three of them
its not the men we fear
its the evil spirits
robin of the hood
son of a devil worshipper
your father died a coward
cursing you and squealing
like a stuck pig
youll bring no justice
to your father by dying
there are your ghosts
wind chimes
a childs toy put to good use
you scare easily my painted moor
this forest has eyes
i swear it
in my dreams alone
have i imagined such a place
then imagine a way to cross it
theres hope
there was a rich man from nottingham
who tried to cross the river
what a dope
he tripped on a rope
now look at him shiver
beg for mercy rich man
i beg of no man
this is our river and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax
i will pay no tax
as you can see i have nothing
not even my sword
bollocks
any man who travels with two servants
and claims hes got no money is either
a fool or a liar
yeah hes a liar
who are you
john little
bestman of the woods
well bestman you lead this rabble
yes i do mate
and if you want to travel through
sherwood forest itll cost you
that gold medallion
its sacred to me
its sacred to us too matey
it will feed us for a month
you must fight me for it
love to mate
be careful father
he walloped 12 of the sheriffs men
is that so
reckon ill enjoy this
hes your father
help me
hes drowning
lost something
thanks for the taxes
the little rich boys lost for words
any great ideas
get up move faster
move faster great idea
were not through yet
all right my old cocker
you want another good walloping
youll have it
ive made it past the gate john little
or should i call you little john
swimming time again old chum
where is he do you see him
its a bloody shame
he was a brave lad
do you yield
i cant bloody swim
do you yield
yes
good now put your feet down
ill be buggered
the medallion
give me your name first
robin of locksley
well robin of locksley
you got balls of solid rock come on
thats much the millers son
harold brownwell
that stumpy one is david of doncaster
but the lads call him bull
because youre short
its because im so long
save it
save it for the ladies
give him some mead
i made that myself
has english hospitality changed so
in six years
that a friend of mines not welcome
but hes a savage sire
that he is
but no more than you or i
and dont call me sire
with regret i must decline
allah forbids it
your loss
why are so many of you in hiding
were all outlaws
got prices on our heads
even the lad
hes a blasted sheriff
he says we owe him taxes
your ghost will only keep his men
at bay so long
theyve worked so far
you have a better idea
we can fight back
did i crack your noble head
these are all good lads here
with hearts of oak but theyre farmers
itd be lambs to the slaughter
they say the sheriff was raised by a witch
she knows every mans thoughts
she flies
thats codswallop
the rich son of a devil worshipper
cares what happens to outlaw peasants
my lord was kind and generous
who dares believe him capable
my father was no devil worshipper
ill have words with any man
who says otherwise
but hes right
i was a rich mans son
but i killed the sheriffs men
so im an outlaw like you
you are nothing like us
thats will scarlet
take no notice hes full of piss and wind
come on drink up
stop talking so much rubbish
this is the best we simple men can expect
here were safe
here we are kings
too much mead friend
forgive me i overslept
rest yourself
what day is it
sunday i think
do they still give alms
to the poor at mass
that they do
now the need for mercy
is greater than ever
we beseech thy blessing lord
on all your people but most especially
on our noble sheriff of nottingham
grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect
our glorious city
grant him also the strength
to bring to justice the lawless men
who would threaten its safety
and prosperityand the judgment
to punish them
in your name amen
go in peace
thats all i have
alms for a blind man milady
for one who cannot see your beauty
what are you doing here
searching my soul
i do not wish to be seen with an outlaw
you prefer nottinghams company
theres a price on your head
how much
one hundred gold pieces
is that all
i shall have to annoy the sheriff more
soon it will be 1000
for 1000 id turn you in myself
nottingham is mounting an army
he has every blacksmith in the county
making swords and armor
whats his plan
i dont know
theres no limit to his ambitions
thank you
quickly go
do something for me
take a bath
a bath
these are my private chambers my son
i have priests who would hear
your confession
i see the boy i knew in the man before me
welcome home robin
you shine like the sun milady
youve been meeting with robin
my cousin tells me the knave deprived you
of some horses
yes a most disagreeable experience
and for inflicting that upon you
ill hang him from the walls
by his entrails
id like to see that
if youd bring your household within
the city i could attend to your needs
thank you but i prefer to stay
in my familys home for now
then perhaps youd do me the honor
of accepting a token
of my undying devotion to your safety
king richard will be moved to hear
of your concern for my welfare
im afraid the king has many enemies
abroad and at home
i fear for his safe return
fear not dear sheriff he will return
and when he does he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects
i asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one
because his answer vexed me
so grievously
he said
he must meet god
with a clear conscience
you lie
on your souls do not shed blood
in the house of god
locksley
ill cut your heart out
with a spoon
then it begins
close that gate
what are you looking at
water
thank you
for the animal
how can i protect you
if i know not where you go
you hardly raise a finger
when you do know
great one
i prefer to have the choice
youve stolen the sheriffs horse
youve stirred up a hornets nest now
are you afraid
yeah a little
so is the sheriff and today
i gave him a sting hell not forget
you fool you started a war
were already at war
bread
i say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes
and hunts our children
you planning to join us
no to lead you
these are simple people
they are not warriors
be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes
you forget yourself i do not ask
for your company or council
why a spoon cousin why not an axe
because its dull you twit itll hurt more
i want this brigand found
starve them out
slaughter their no take their livestock
i want locksleys own people fighting
to bring his head in
perhaps we could create a name for him
something to drive fear into the populace
maybe locksley the lethal
or wreaking robin
i want him dead by the full moon
before the barons come back
now sew
and keep the stitches small
hes not here
wheres your mate the man called little
he died last winter
burn it down
leave the sow her young
will feed us through winter
youve heard of the sherwood bandit
robin of the hood yes
pray he is brought to us before winter
over here
they burned it all of it
there
look what theyve done
if its fame you seek christian
i think you have it
you brought this misery on us locksley
nottingham is trying to divide us
we are divided rich boy
im not as blind as that old man
youre still trying to be lord of the manor
i heard the sheriff now values your neck
at 500 gold pieces
i say we take him in
you think the sheriff will give everything
back after im gone
hell give us the reward and our pardons
wrong
hell stretch your necks one by one
what would you have us do
fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and bare hands
if needs be
but with the one true weapon
that escapes you
courage
look out
thank you wulf
you wish to end this
you wish to go home
then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves
and face that the price may be dear
i would rather die
than spend my life in hiding
the sheriff calls us outlaws
but i say we are free
and one free man defending his home
is more powerful
than ten hired soldiers
the crusades taught me that
ill make no promises save one
if you truly believe in your hearts
that you are free
then we can win
they got armor
they got armor bull
even this boy can learn
to find the chinks in armor
but we aint got no food
what do we need that the forest
cannot provide we have food
wood for weapons
well find safety in the trees
what about our kin
sheriff took all they got
then by god we take it back
whats the meaning of this
a woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations
how dare you
please dont take that dont take that
they belong to our lord
now they belong to my lord sheriff
give it back
good
tell the sheriff for every harm he does
these people i will repay him tenfold
something vexes thee
what the devil
its a hot day friend
to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse
the sheriff will hear of this
i truly hope so
buy yourself a new sow
god bless you fanny
and god bless robin hood
we reckon hes nicked
three to four million
in the last five months
raise the bounty on his head
25000 crowns
begging your pardon it wont do no good
how much you raise it
why is that
because of the poor
he gives them what he takes
well sirethey love him
just a minute
robin hood steals money
from my pocket
forcing me to hurt the public
and they love him for it
yes
cancel the food scraps
for lepers and orphans
no more merciful beheadings
and call off christmas
the treasury is empty
day and night people plague my door
whining for tax relief and safe passage
through sherwood forest
we cant pay thee
what the highwaymans taken
its the shortest route to london
its the only route to london
sir guys patrols have found nothing sire
no camp nothing
this hooded viper simply slithers
into the forest
you my room 1030 tonight
you 1045
and bring a friend
whats the pleasure in this life
laughter love and drinking
good king richard bless his soul
loves his wine and warring
but for us who stay at home
theres only beer and whoring
how many
twenty
how many
five
they cant count
why scare them
and they call me a barbarian
quiet
it will be difficult to sing
with a sword in your gullet
yes my lord
shut up and help me move this log
this is a tree not a log
shut up and help me
i have to meet a girl
men in front after me
the rest stay with the wagon

nottingham soldiers are poor company
to travel with
tax him
im robin of locksley
and my men are thirsty
robin hood

to spare a few barrels for good christians
weve much to celebrate
if you wish them to share
in the good lords brew
best me for it
confess robin hood

holier and wiser man than thou art
he giveth and he taketh away
do you yield
id rather roast in hell
i think the friars taken us far enough
thank you lord for teaching me humility
thanks for the beer

we need an honest man to minister them
what say you
the lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways
i accept
you wont regret it
aye but you may

my ladys intrusion is tit for tat
out of the way old traps

you cant go down there
whats there
cover your eyes
you couldve said
you have visitors
it werent my fault
it was much
it werent me
what are you doing
taking a ladys advice
what happened to your eye
we was set upon by ten
twelve
fifteen large big lads
youve been busy
we have guests
it works
kind of
of course it works
take your time
can you do it amidst distraction
can you make the shot when you must
show him wulf
can you
it was a dirty trick
is your shirt coming off
well done
this is grain which any fool can eat
but for which the lord intended
a more divine means of consumption
let us give praise to our maker
and glory to his bounty
by learning about
beer
are you bragging
this is blood money marian
intended to bribe king richards enemies
to unite against him
we intercepted it
who would
nottingham
nottingham would not challenge the king
the kings not here to be challenged
while hes away he may lose his country
you thought i was keeping it all
didnt you
a contribution to your cause
keep it
it will fetch a great price
its not dear to me
it is
its not
im saying everything wrong
cheers
how do i get down
wait
we dont go that way anymore
im happy to hear that
grab on
we have a rule here
once someone has seen the way
to our camp that person cannot leave
too many lives are at stake
thats why sarah and i were blindfolded
will you join us for dinner
perhaps
salaam little one
did god paint you
did god paint me
for certain
why
because
allah loves wondrous variety
how is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman
has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth
ive seen knights panic
at the first hint of battle
and ive seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body
to defend a dying horse
nobilitys not a birthright
its defined by ones actions
its interesting to hear you say that
i didnt
my father did
did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him
i dont know
all i know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger
i was lost after my mother died
my father too and for a short time
he found comfort
with another woman
a peasant woman
i felt he betrayed my mothers memory
he gave her up
for the love of a 12yearold boy
who would never forgive him
who says im content
i have my plans for the future
a grander scheme than this
no a simpler one
a homefamily
love
men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose
when it doesnt tis a burden to them
robin of the hood
prince of thieves
is he capable of love
father
its mother shes dying
your baby has not turned
it cannot be born without help
hes the devils seed sent to lead us astray
hell kill her
if you do not listen to me
she will die and the child
the friars done all he can
i suggest you let the moor try
so be it
then be it on your head
get me a needle thread water
hurry
come with me john
what will you do
ive seen it many times
with horses
with horses
bite down
help me
it will be all right
i tell you john the barbarian is killing her
out of the way boy
quick take him
what is it
your son milady
you truly are a great one
my son
look at the lovely little baby
isnt he wonderful
the lord has taught me a fine lesson
though i may think i am godly
i am not worldly
please
my barbarian friend lets open a barrel
and try to save each others souls
alas i am not permitted
fine you talk ill drink
may i have this dance
this lady is spoken for
why this way
so you cannot return
or be forced to tell others the way
it was good to see you marian
it was good to be seen
i have two favors to ask
one
take duncan with you
i fear for his health
and im tired of his bellyaching
you wish me to leave
old friend listen to me
take marian safely home
i fear for her safety
of course sire
two
youre king richards cousin
you can get word to him
of nottinghams plan
he would believe you
if the sheriff found out id lose all i have
thats true
do it for your king
no
ill do it for you
he fancies you milady
i am blind but some things i can still see
in ten days the barons are coming
robin hood stole what i was to pay
for their allegiance
i am surrounded by fools
who do not realize my obligations
tell me mortianna
am i thwarted
recruit the beasts that share our god
animals
from the north
you mean celts
they drink the blood of the dead
yoke their strength
hired thugs
brilliant
put thine own issue on the throne
a child how
ally with royal blood
who
its a personal matter my lord
but of vital importance
i understand milady
this is my most trusted emissary
he must travel to france immediately
and give this personally to the king
my ladyinwaiting will accompany you
my dear i could not vouch for her safety
the journey is full of danger
i appreciate your concern but sarahs
a skilled rider and i insist she go
as you wish
whats wrong
my horse is favoring his foreleg
duncan is that you

amen
my lady marian
by what right do you keep me prisoner
you misunderstand my intentions
youve been brought here
for your own protection
protection from whom
from yourself
it seems youve been consorting
with outlaws
where do you hear such lies
by your own hand milady
im sorry my child
i feared you were being led astray
come
its over
today i return justice to this land
i shall hang the ringleaders
of course but
ill be generous and give you the lives
of the woodsmen and their families
the children
and of course
your traitorous ladyinwaiting
as a wedding gift
and just whom am i supposed to marry
search your heart my child
why not a union
with the house of nottingham
and heal the wounds in our land
only one man can heal the wounds
of this land
robin hood
im truly sorry milady
he wasted his life
how many lives would you waste
what a beautiful child
so young
so alive so unaware
of how precarious life can be
i had a very sad childhood
ill tell you about it sometime
i never knew my parents
its amazing im sane
our bonding would allow these children
to grow up as my allies
you understand
i cannot allow them to grow up
as my enemies
i have no choice
thats true
look
christian
i have heard that robin hood
may still be alive
either tell me where he may be hiding
or well hang you catch him anyway
and do the same to him
id love to kill him for you
so he is alive then
im not really sure
then why would i need you
because my lord if he is alive
i can get close to him
im one of his men
hed never suspect me
he knows you hate him
shut up
hes a trusting fool
and if he doesnt believe me hell kill me
then youve lost nothing
if you fail
i will personally remove
your lying tongue
my pride brought us to this
its you who gave pride to these people
i was a fool
a fool to let him leave
to believe i planned it so perfectly
a wise man once said
there are no perfect men in this world
only perfect intentions
you were an honor
to your countrymen today
you fought better
than twenty english knights
i thought you were taken
i was
howd you escape
traitor

get in there
nobody escapes the sheriff
unless hes lining his pockets

the hangings are part of the celebration
for the sheriffs marriage

ive never trusted you thats no secret
will you finish what you started
or will he run like the spoiled rich boy

where does this hatred for me come from
from knowing that
our father loved you best
our father
we are brothers
im the son of the woman who replaced
your dead mother for a time
your anger drove them apart
its a lie
its not a lie you ruined my life
i have more reason to hate you
than anyone
but i dared to believe in you
what i must know brother
is will you stay with us
and finish what you started
i have a brother
i have a brother
i will make my stand with you
side by side
to the end
to the end

the mystery is in the black powder
surely the lord will grant us victory
youll be by the gate
to cut off reinforcements

to protect our escape
i will hide below the scaffold
to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal
