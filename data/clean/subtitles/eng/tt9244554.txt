well start with extraction
which is a fancy word
for trashing the planet
but this looks like
is we chop down the trees
we blow up the mountains
to get the metals inside
and use up all the water
and we wipe out the animals
we are running out
of resources
now i know this can be hard
to hear but its the truth
so weve got to deal with it
in the past
three decades alone
onethird of the planets
natural resource space
has been consumed
gone
we are cutting and mining
and hauling
and trashing the place so fast
that were undermining
the planets very ability
for people to live here
we have 5
of the worlds population
but were using 30
of the worlds resources
if everybody consumed
at us rates
we would need
three to five planets
and you know what
weve only got one
oh my god
you live in that
seriously
does your chicken have a name
chicken
chicken
chicken
wheres all your stuff
i divested
cut myself down
to a hundred things
what do you mean
a hundred things
shirts one thing
bowls one thing
fork sleeping bag chicken
and you kept that hat

the art museum on wilshire
i was on a date
i ditched the guy
we went straight to your truck
in the parking structure
it was right next to
the la brea tar pits
by the mammoths
okay
first of all
this isnt a mammoth
its an elephant
second of all youre saying
i bought this property
because i had a subconscious
sexual memory
prompted by this sculpture
which you brought me straight to
the minute i came to visit you
uninvited
look im here on business
alastair pinch the actor
killed his wife
look maybe he killed her

stevie and i were at my estate

most entertaining
to let him motor about the lawn
with me outside the car
trying to dodge it
excuse me
i need a shoot mr pinch
oh thank you cherub

stevie a sporting chance

from when i was just a tyke
in tuscaloosa
my granddaddy
raymond forbishaw
he was a jurist himself
family court
he used to set me on his knee
and say
johnnie for 99 days
the judges job
is merely to be that blindfold
on the statue of lady justice
for 99 days you do that
and justice
in its natural wisdom
will find its own way
but johnnie hed say
on the 100th day
a great judge knows
that he needs to be justice
now i wouldnt be so bold as to
call myself a great judge
but i do know
that as i sit here today
im thinking about
my granddaddy
and thats why
im gonna direct this verdict
and find this here defendant

down that way
i realized i had no recollection
of the previous night
i came in here
found my sweet monica
i ran back to the kitchen
dialed 911
there was a shattered vase
anyhow
when the ambulance arrived
they told me
she was already gone
and had been
for quite some time
does anyone else have keys
only rosario thats our nanny
and she was in venezuela
visiting her family
nanny
you have kids in the house
yes
we have one child gaby
she likely wasnt
the killer either
but shell be home
from kindergarten soon enough
if you think its worth
trying to wrest a confession
pretty glib considering
forgive me
dear gaby doesnt even know
of course but
the world is certain
i murdered my wife mr waldo
and i cant even tell you
the world is wrong
if you know a man whos handled
a similar predicament
with more élan point me to him
and i shall gladly emulate
you ever thought about trying
to stop drinking
all the time
but this doesnt seem the week
for that now does it
daddy
princess ozma

gaby and i are going to spend
some daddy time before bed
you snuggly baby
oh you havent decided
to take the case yet have you
what say you detective

on the media circus
oh come on fontella

an indictment
as early as tomorrow
weve not been told that
and now the la times
is reporting
that sources on the lapd say
there are no
unidentified fingerprints
anywhere in that room
what does that suggest to you
it suggests that
the real killer
knew what he was doing
you promised us
charlie waldo
from the lydell lipps case
what does it say
that hes not here with you
charlie waldo
is busy uncovering
welcome to kindergartens
of the rich and famous

park this beast

a thousand times
and now how abhorred

and dad can recite them too
half the time
these parents cant

mm and that sculpture
the bard
the sculpture
this
ah dear boy
thats a regis award
for my richard iii
did you move it
ive never been much
for acting trophies
monica had that one on display
for sentimental reasons
that was the production
on which we met
really
perhaps its wherever monica
put my other regises
or my peoples choice award
good night sweet prince
flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest
in the old rugged cross
stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for twas on that old cross
jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me
there goes the good girl
kindergarten teacher
just wait till i have
a few makers in me
so why werent you shocked
that monica pinch was killed
okay mr waldo
i have a confession
okay
ive been watching
all this tv coverage
since the murder
i knew exactly who you were
the minute you walked into
my classroom
that figures
who was lydell lipps
everyone keeps talking
about lydell lipps
i can usually tell when
someones messing with me
youre jamming up my radar
maybe your radars just rusty
yeah maybe
here you go
thanks
to whiskey and good hair
its been a while
okay if you want to know
ill tell you
11 years ago
there was a robbery at 711
the girl behind the counter
and two customers
got shot dead
i turned up a kid
named donny lipps
leaned on him pretty hard
it paid off
he said he was waiting
in the car outside
and in return for a deal
he would give me the shooter
turns out that was lydell
his brother
signed sealed
my careers off to the races
right
and i am on fire with ambition
everythings going great
cut to years later
lydell comes up for parole
and the prosecutors ask me to
help them prep for the hearing
so i go see the brother again
whos in prison himself
at this point
three strikes unrelated
only now he tells me that
the original story was bullshit
he made it up
to get me off his back
so at that point
lydell had been in jail for
7 years 3 months and 16 days
well next thing i learn
it is a lot harder to get
an innocent man out of jail
than to put a guilty man in
system isnt designed
to deal with mistakes
and some individuals arent
either
but i keep pushing
and i keep pushing
and i keep pushing
and im doing everything i can
and this goes on for a year
and then lydell got stabbed
in a yard fight
and he bled to death
after spending every day
of his adult life
locked up for something
that he didnt fucking do
and that i
built a career on
and when i run out of people
that would listen
which took about six months
um
i quit
and i started talking
to anyone with a microphone
i guess that would have
burned a lot of bridges
oh i burned the fucking river
you still havent told me
what
why werent you shocked
about monica pinch
oh of course i was shocked
i mean how could i
not be shocked
i dont follow
waldo
cant you tell when a girl just
wants to have a drink with you
i said a drink
three years in the woods
you havent been
with anybody all that time
no
thats kind of hot waldo
alastair

those are news helicopters
lapds putting on a show

for the murder of monica pinch

or lied to your wife
to cover for you
charlie fucking waldo

cerebral hemorrhage
severe blow in the right temple
second contusion
back of the head

back to 100
yeah thats right
charlie waldo
this is what i want
one everyone who was on
crime scene security
two all transport medical
and emergency personnel
who had contact
with the victim and the suspect
dont talk to him
nobody gives him anything
hes a rat
nothing to see here
shows over
lets go back to work
all right
how about first to respond
ill start there
huh
dont talk to him
nobody talks to him
hes not here all right
you ignored him understand
understood
you do what i say not him
you
officer
anus
annis
high school must have sucked
do not speak to him annis
you were at the pinch house
you the first ones
you and your partner
annis
do you know who
fontella davis is
ignore him
do you want her
on tv every night
making this case about you
shows over
when you arrived
at the house
was the door deadbolted
you sure its frosted glass
you couldnt see him unlock it
you heard it that clearly
the alarm was on
we saw him disarm it
what did i say
yes anus
but the real killer could have
set the alarm on the way out
if the door wasnt deadbolted
hes just talking in circles
what about
the murder weapon
its all bullshit
the earthenware vase
it wasnt you that gathered up
all the pieces was it
do not fucking answer him
all right
yes waldo he got all
the pieces of the murder weapon
i supervised it myself
the earthenware vase
the earthenware vase
only the earthenware vase
isnt the murder weapon
not if alastair pinch
killed her
that things got to weigh
28 pounds
it came down
over the victims right eye
youd have to be pretty strong a
lefty to make a shot like that
not a drunken righty
almost convincing
pinch is a righty
ive watched him pour
officer annis
could i have a moment
you see that statue
thats a regis award
for acting in england
you ever seen it before
thats cause its missing
thats the murder weapon

gomes is dead

i just spoke with the police
someone shot him
just before you arrived
it wasnt you per chance

why dont you tell me
what he was doing for you
warren gomes has had
a talent for special research
which allows my company
to make what it makes
which is
money
so gomes was digging up dirt
to help you buy the network
why do you want me to stay away
from pinch

alastair
well earned sir
have you had enough
ive had enough
lets you and i have a drink
help me up
oh youve trimmed the hedges
handsome devil
you remember
having mates dont you waldo
not like you
there you go
you were right of course
i am shitfaced
more than usual
chinchin
you know what you should have
done when your young man died
you should have gone on
an epic twoweek pub crawl
gotten it all out
of your system
to selfpity
hm
that was a powerful observation
coming from the master
you and i are two sides
of the same coin arent we
and now here you are
back among the living
in a way you werent
just a week ago
mm
oh you see a difference
mm
all the difference in the world
dicking refuckulous the way
you confronted me out there
you didnt have that in you when
you first shuffled onto my set
with that rats nest of a beard
and those dead eyes
youve been brought back
to life mate
like so many of us
by singular carnal charms
is jayne keeping the baby
i think about her all the time
but i havent thought it right
to telephone
given the circumstances
and i was such a cad
especially after she told me
but i was married after all
and what was i to do
and then after the business
with my sweet monica
im tired waldo
fearing that you may not be
as good as others believe
its common to all men
but fearing that deep down
you may be a monster
thats a whole different
flavor of hell
ladies and gentlemen
we are about to begin
please find your seats
hey
hey
you should have told me
about you and alastair
theres nothing to tell
hes a kindergarten dad
dont worry its not alastair
its me
i found this burner
in his house
on the night his wife died
he texted back and forth
with someone inviting her over
someone who said
shed be right there
come on
lets talk
did you have a thing
with swag doggg too
yes
and that crazy rich guy
jamshidi
you know
ive been getting beaten up
and threatened all week
because of you
it had nothing to do
with monica pinch
it was a bunch of rich guys
that didnt want their affairs
with you exposed
what do you want waldo
im a thrillseeker and im
teaching fucking kindergarten
and what could be a bigger rush
than sleeping with the detective
investigating a death
youre involved in
it wasnt just that
i really felt something
start from the beginning
and no bullshit
i was hoping that he would leave
his wife
but he was an asshole
and he kept talking about
how she wanted him to move back
to england with her
like he didnt give a shit
about what i was telling him
and after that
total radio silence
but i kept texting him
which was probably stupid
and then one night he
he messaged me back
saying that
that monica was out of the house
and i should come over
and we could talk about us
and before i can even ring
the bell
monica opens the door
and tells me to come inside
shes holding his phone
shes the one who messaged me
to come over
she tells me alastairs
passed out in the study and
she wanted to see who it was
when she found out
it was her daughters teacher
she got pretty unhinged
kept talking about
how la was this evil city
and
what a mistake it was
coming to la
i was scared
she was gonna get violent so
i just ran out of there
i drove away
and then
the next day
i heard monica was dead
and i tried reaching out
to alastair
but he was even more
of an asshole
he wouldnt talk to me
not even when he was
dropping gaby off
so
well when the when the chips
started falling on him
i just let them fall
and youre pregnant
alastairs
jayne
were about to start
yeah
be right there
can we pick this up later
after the play and lawyers
theres her necklace
and her ring
next ill take the child
as the king
today i brew
tomorrow i bake
and then the prince child
ill take
for no one knows
my little game
and rumpelstiltskin is my name
to guess my name
shell never guess
jayne
that girl from louisiana law
whats her name yeah
i need you to call her agent
i mean is she pregnant
or is it
i dont know shes unhappy
cause its weird
i mean
i dont know if she changed
what shes eating but
you tell me
but theyre feeding her
something very very strange
cause i have never seen a shape
quite like that
waddling through the lot
and ii was like
its not gonna work
i dont want to look at that
all right
well you tell him
all right bye
mr waldo
mr sikorsky
apologies for the interruption
but i made some progress
oh you did
fantastic
what is that
that my friend is signed
by every quarterback
who ever won two super bowls
may i
please
be my guest
may i also say it is so good
to see your baby face
peeking out
where once a dead animal lay
and just when you thought i
couldnt get any more handsome
i have a runthrough but um
fuck em
i want to hear this
shoot
its good news i guess
i know who killed monica pinch
fantastic
i mean
mm
theres a young lady
named jayne white
she was the pinch girls
kindergarten teacher
whatd a kindergarten teacher
want to kill monica pinch for
she and alastair were having
an affair
you dont look surprised
they had a complicated marriage
well you knew them pretty well
knew them well
we did st barts last year
im just so fuckin relieved
its not alastair you know
im sure you are
i knew you were my guy
fontella said
dont hire that bum
he stinks in every way
but i was like no
thats my guy
and do i know casting
or do i know casting
is this chick in custody
are we good
jayne
yeah
no
no she left town
ah well find her
shes a fuckin kindergarten
teacher not whitey bulger
thats a winwin for waldo
and sikorsky
you get the killer
i get to keep my syndication
i mean its a tragedy but
you know as tragedies go
mm
but thank you
you know great job and
did you know jayne white
i know of her
did you know that alastair
had gotten her pregnant
hey
im just wondering
if that was something
many people were aware of
many people no
this is innercircle stuff
right but
youre in the inner circle
i founded the inner circle
you know he knows what im
doing if you know what i mean
i know what hes doing
if you know what i mean
so what was monica pinchs
reaction
when she found out
jayne white was pregnant
she was devastated
i bet
i mean she probably
pushed alastair even harder
to quit the show
and move back to england
i cant speak to that
cause i dont know her
as well as i know him
right
but you knew about the awards
the shakespeare awards
you talked about
theyre called regis
by the way
what did you say
you said they were all
under the bed
under the bed in the attic
doesnt matter
he just didnt want them around
ah gotcha
its funny
they were under the bed
so
its just alastair said
he wasnt sure where they were
its not a big deal
listen
this is great chatting with you
but time is not my friend
im sorry im sorry
ill let you go
thanks
monica pinch
quickly
monica pinch
now she didnt find out
that jayne white was pregnant
until the night she died
so if she talked to you
about it
it must have been then right
uh im gonna have to back you
up a second there mr waldo
you said that jayne white
was the murderer
oh no i said i knew
who the murderer was
oh
warren gomes
does that name mean anything
to you
no
well he was this lawyer
i had a little bit
of a weird thing with him
he kept following me
for a couple days
and i kind of lost my temper
and i confronted him one day
we got into a little fight
a couple hours later
he got killed
yeah
im just trying to piece
everything together
the question is
why bring it up
he had the same kind of watch
as you
rich lawyer
thats what i thought
only i researched them
theyll all individually made
right
no two are identical
heres the thing
the one he was wearing
it looked a lot like yours
pure coincidence
this one hasnt left my wrist
except when i shower and sleep
but you asked fontella
what time it was
what when
at the courthouse
after alastairs arraignment
im afraid you must be mistaken
but uh
oh fuck it
take a seat
i want to hear everything
youre thinking
soup to nuts all right
soup to nuts
yes please
doublefuck the readthrough
lets do that lets do it
you sure
yes sir
buckle up
well im thinking
that you knew what
monica pinch kept under her bed
cause you were spending time
in her bedroom
while alastair was spending time
with jayne
mr waldo
that is brilliant
im thinking
that on the night she found out
that hed gotten jayne pregnant
with alastair passed out cold
im thinking
that monica called you
to tell you she was gonna
tell alastair about your affair
to get him to quit the show
and move back to england
like shed been wanting
but you couldnt afford
to lose alastair
not with the jamshidi
takeover threat
im thinking that you drove
over there
you were gonna talk some sense
into monica
but she didnt want to hear it
next thing
you guys are arguing
it escalates
and you pick up the regis award
and you hit her with it
you didnt mean to do it
its an act of passion
thing is shes hit her head
on the way down
and now shes not moving
so you panic
and you start wiping down
everything you can remember
touching
but the regis award
was on a wooden table
and that had bloodstains on it
now im thinking
im just thinking
maybe you were worried that
some of that was your blood
you couldve got cut
in the fight
so now what do you do
you swap around some furniture
you set the alarm
on the way out
you get rid of the regis
in some dumpster
and you let poor old alastair
wake up to take the rap
how did i do
come on
and the lawyer guy
what
he blackmailed you
he even made you cough up
that fancy watch
which you couldnt resist
taking back after you shot him
huh
that is quite brilliant
in fact i should give you
a pilot deal
there is one gaping hole
in your narrative however
why would i sabotage the biggest
asset on this network
come on
thats the easy part
you told me yourself
the scandal made the show
twice as valuable
you knew alastair would get off
i mean its la
the star always gets off
and in the meantime
the more publicity
the bigger the windfall
so what do you do
you hire the lawyer
wholl make the most noise
and then the detective
who would make the most noise
even though your lawyer
kept telling you
id be a shitty choice
and lets be honest
i am a shitty choice
ive never been a pi
the lapd fucking hates me
im so rusty
id probably be useless
but i think you liked me
for those reasons
cause that made me
the last detective
whod ever figure out
that you killed monica pinch
and warren gomes
a lot of moving parts
a lot of moving parts
i do have one question
what made you so sure
that you walk in here
and deliver that little pitch
ill be honest
i only walked in 98 sure
ah
what was the other 2
i had to make sure
you were a lefty
i did make one mistake though
i really shouldve waited
until the cops got here
you you told them to come
well if i timed it right
theyre already downstairs
of course
i dont have a watch
after you
yeah you just keep smiling
watch your haircut
come on
look alive fellas
pete couldnt make it himself
you know hes not gonna let you
out of this collar right
im gonna head
to north hollywood
tell pete ill meet him there
see you in court
what are you doing
get off my bike
were not cops man
were were extras
shut the fuck up
fuck fuck
ho ho ho merry christmas
fuck
lady justice
make sure that
he isnt prejudiced
or predispositioned
fuck
for 99 days you do that
and justice in its natural
wisdom will find its own way
but johnnie hed say
on the 100th day
a great judge knows
that he needs to be justice
ready for your closeup
wait wait
i do know
that as i sit here today
how are you gonna get away
with this
a light fell on set
happens all the time
last looks
and find
this here defendant guilty
what the fuck
this place is fallin apart
waldo
hey q
well thats that then
yeah
would it be ungrateful
to ask what youre doing here
ive been following you
since the recruiting office
i even had to sit through
that rumpelstiltskin bullshit
really
yeah
howd you get on the lot
snuck in on a studio tour
yeah
they really need to check out
their security
i could be like a crazy
stalker or something you know
i uh hope you dont mind
i used your gun
i was never here
yeah
i can work with that
grand
you do know why i saved
your ass right
yeah i got an idea
mm
someone else kills you first
i cant get what i want
itll be a mess
nobody will know what to do
with themselves
you know i got to say q
its not too clever
keeping your kind of business
records on a flash drive
is that what cuppy thinks
is on there
business records
the guys an idiot
why
what is on there
epic poem
longass motherfucker too
its the only copy i got
epic poem that you wrote
yeah that i wrote
ah
its about the life of a dealer
trying to retain
his independence and integrity
in an era
of corporatestyle cartels
why an epic poem
see me im an autodidact
means im selfeducated
i had to enrich my own life
but my little girl dulcy
im gonna make sure my daughter
gets a real education
that way she aint stuck
being no cop no dealer
i want to give the poem to her
so she can see the man
i really am
waldo i need my mem
i need lorena to come back
so
ill tell you what
i want you to get my little girl
into that fancyass
private school
same one as that
british dudes kid
get him to help dulcy
and bring me back my mem
and lorena can come back
have you got the juice for that
you know i just might
okay waldo
you got another 24 hours
by the way
i love johnnies bench
you know
my granddaddy once said
its one thing to write
like a poet
and another thing altogether
to write like a historian
a poet can rehash
or sing about things
not like they were
