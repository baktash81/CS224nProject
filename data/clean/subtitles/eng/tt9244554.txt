we ll start with extraction 
which is a fancy word
for trashing the planet 
but this looks like
is we chop down the trees 
we blow up the mountains
to get the metals inside
and use up all the water 
and we wipe out the animals 
we are running out
of resources 
now  i know this can be hard
to hear  but it s the truth 
so we ve got to deal with it 
in the past
three decades alone 
one third of the planet s
natural resource space
has been consumed 
gone 
we are cutting and mining
and hauling
and trashing the place so fast
that we re undermining
the planet s very ability
for people to live here 
we have 5 
of the world s population 
but we re using 30 
of the world s resources 
if everybody consumed
at u s  rates 
we would need
three to five planets 
and you know what 
we ve only got one 
oh  my god 
you live in that 
seriously 
does your chicken have a name 
chicken 
chicken 
chicken 
where s all your stuff 
i divested 
cut myself down
to a hundred things 
what do you mean 
a hundred things 
shirt s one thing 
bowl s one thing 
fork  sleeping bag  chicken 
and you kept that hat 
tell me you at least have a gun 
jesus  waldo 
when s the last time
you had anybody up here 
three years 
you got any friends 
chicken 
wow

i bought the land
from a sculptor 
sure  because this spoke to you 
right 
remember that time
we were supposedly  broken up  
i ran into you outside
the art museum on wilshire 
i was on a date 
i ditched the guy 
we went straight to your truck
in the parking structure 
it was right next to
the la brea tar pits 
by the mammoths 
okay 
first of all 
this isn t a mammoth 
it s an elephant 
second of all  you re saying
i bought this property
because i had a subconscious
sexual memory
prompted by this sculpture 
which you brought me straight to
the minute i came to visit you 
uninvited 
look  i m here on business 
  alastair pinch  the actor   
  killed his wife 
look  maybe he killed her 
maybe he didn t

the guy s a blackout drunk 
the network s got a lot riding
on him 
so they re paying
for his lawyer 
so he did kill her 
it means the money s serious 
they re looking to hire a p i 
this gig could jump me
to the majors 
if i could deliver the famous
charlie waldo
to work it with me

they always want to put
a big name in it 
i m retired 
i see that 
from the force 
i d be willing to go 80 20 
yours

with the money 
buy a nicer hundred things 
 cause then my life

stevie and i were at my estate 
i was drinking absinthe

how to drive 
and that it might be
most entertaining
to let him motor about the lawn
with me outside the car 
  trying to dodge it 
  excuse me 
i need a shoot  mr  pinch 
oh  thank you  cherub 
anyway  i thought i d give
stevie a sporting chance

pissing claret in ward c 
where s my mustache fluffer 
last looks

i get him wednesday nights
after jessica biel 
love this job 
background 
and    action 
let me tell you a story
from when i was just a tyke
in tuscaloosa 
my granddaddy 
raymond forbishaw 
he was a jurist himself 
family court 
he used to set me on his knee
and say 
 johnnie  for 99 days 
the judge s job
is merely to be that blindfold
on the statue of lady justice 
for 99 days  you do that 
and justice 
in its natural wisdom 
will find its own way 
but  johnnie   he d say   
    on the 100th day 
a great judge knows
that he needs to be justice  
now  i wouldn t be so bold as to
call myself a great judge 
but i do know
that as i sit here today 
i m thinking about
my granddaddy 
and that s why
i m gonna direct this verdict
and find this here defendant   
guilty 
cut 
alastair  that was terrific 
terrific 
it was bloody genius 
you re not going
to top that one 
i ll see you all tomorrow then 
did you hear what i just said 
he s supposed to say
 not guilty  
  he said guilty 
  fuck 
could have just told me
i had ass cancer 
sorry 
  alastair 
  yes 
oh  god 
i hate to do this to you 
but we re gonna have
to do one more 
  the last line is  not guilty  
   not guilty  
  what did i say 
  guilty 
  the fuck i did 
  yeah  he didn t say that 
did    i mean 
but really  just please 
no 
i know what i said  love 
so let s just look
at the playback 
he wouldn t have said that 
can we just see
the playback  please 
you    what are you smirking at 
what  i didn t say anything 
do you think it s easy
to carry this piece of shit
on my shoulders week after week 
you think i need a twat like you
standing there
hoping i ll cock it up 
how long have you worked
on the show 
it s my first week 
your first week

direct this verdict

no  thank you 
i deplore drinking alone 
so i ll have a double 
she was so proud of this room 
chin chin 
it was in town and wanker
magazine  you know 
why don t you walk me
through that morning 
all right 
one more time 
it was a saturday 
i woke up    or came to   
in my study 
about a half a mile
down that way 
i realized i had no recollection
of the previous night 
i came in here 
found my sweet monica 
i ran back to the kitchen 
dialed 911 
there was a shattered vase 
anyhow 
when the ambulance arrived 
they told me
she was already gone
and had been
for quite some time 
does anyone else have keys 
only rosario  that s our nanny 
and she was in venezuela
visiting her family 
nanny 
you have kids in the house 
yes 
we have one child  gaby 
she likely wasn t
the killer either 
but she ll be home
from kindergarten soon enough
if you think it s worth
trying to wrest a confession 
pretty glib  considering 
forgive me 
dear gaby doesn t even know 
of course  but   
   the world is certain
i murdered my wife  mr  waldo 
and i can t even tell you
the world is wrong 
if you know a man who s handled
a similar predicament
with more élan  point me to him 
and i shall gladly emulate 
you ever thought about trying
to stop drinking 
all the time 
but this doesn t seem the week
for that  now  does it 
daddy 
princess ozma 
where did you come from 
oh  oh  oh 
want to hear the song little dog
taught us at school today

  i brush and i brush
so my teeth will be white  
  teeth can be shiny 
teeth can be gold  
  i hope i still have some
when i m very old  
  you know it 
  i do know it  gaby 
i d like to meet my new friend 
mr  waldo

gaby and i are going to spend
some daddy time before bed 
you snuggly baby 
oh  you haven t decided
to take the case yet  have you 
what say you  detective 
will you return to your mountain
and leave me to the fates 
or will you stick around
the shitty of the angels
long enough to see the police
maybe get it right this time 
whatever right may look like 
daddy  can mr  lion drive
to school with us tomorrow 
can he please 
please 
yay

an indictment
as early as tomorrow 
we ve not been told that 
and now the l a  times
is reporting
that sources on the lapd say
there are no
unidentified fingerprints
anywhere in that room 
what does that suggest to you 
it suggests that
the real killer
knew what he was doing 
you promised us
charlie waldo
from the lydell lipps case 
what does it say
that he s not here with you 
charlie waldo
is busy uncovering   
welcome to kindergartens

ah  dear boy 
that s a regis award
for my richard iii 
did you move it 
i ve never been much
for acting trophies 
monica had that one on display

that was the production
on which we met 
really 
perhaps it s wherever monica

or my    people s choice award 
good night  sweet prince 
flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest 
  in the old rugged cross  
  stained with blood so divine  
  a wondrous beauty i see  
  for  twas on that old cross  
  jesus suffered and died  
  to pardon and sanctify me  
there goes the good girl
kindergarten teacher 
just wait till i have
a few maker s in me 
so why weren t you shocked
that monica pinch was killed 
okay  mr  waldo 
i have a confession 
okay 
i ve been watching
all this tv coverage
since the murder 
i knew exactly who you were
the minute you walked into
my classroom 
that figures 
who was lydell lipps 
everyone keeps talking
about lydell lipps 
i can usually tell when
someone s messing with me 
you re jamming up my radar 
maybe your radar s just rusty 
yeah  maybe 
here you go 
thanks 
to whiskey and good hair 
it s been a while 
okay  if you want to know 
i ll tell you 
11 years ago 
there was a robbery at 7 11 
the girl behind the counter
and two customers
got shot dead 
i turned up a kid
named donny lipps 
leaned on him pretty hard 
it paid off 
he said he was waiting
in the car outside 
and in return for a deal 
he would give me the shooter 
turns out that was lydell 
his brother 
signed  sealed 
my career s off to the races 
right 
and i am on fire with ambition 
everything s going great 
cut to years later 
lydell comes up for parole 
and the prosecutors ask me to
help them prep for the hearing 
so i go see the brother again 
who s in prison himself
at this point 
three strikes  unrelated 
only now he tells me that
the original story was bullshit 
he made it up
to get me off his back 
so at that point 
lydell had been in jail for   
7 years  3 months  and 16 days 
well  next thing i learn 
it is a lot harder to get
an innocent man out of jail
than to put a guilty man in 
system isn t designed
to deal with mistakes 
and some individuals aren t 
either 
but i keep pushing 
and i keep pushing
and i keep pushing 
and i m doing everything i can 
and this goes on for a year 
and then lydell got stabbed
in a yard fight
and he bled to death 
after spending every day
of his adult life
locked up for something
that he didn t fucking do 
and that i
built a career on 
and when i run out of people
that would listen 
which took about six months   
um   
i quit 
and i started talking
to anyone with a microphone 
i guess that would have
burned a lot of bridges 
oh  i burned the fucking river 
you still haven t told me 
what 
why weren t you shocked
about monica pinch 
oh  of course i was shocked 
i mean  how could i
not be shocked 
i don t follow 
waldo 
can t you tell when a girl just
wants to have a drink with you 
i said a drink 
three years in the woods 
you haven t been
with anybody all that time 
no

yeah  good luck with that 
they indict  defense has
the right to everything

never got you laker tickets
or lied to your wife
to cover for you 
charlie fucking waldo 
jesus

how d you make this 
cerebral hemorrhage 
severe blow in the right temple 
second contusion
back of the head 
probably from where she fell 
victim was found locked
in a house with a drunk
with two assault convictions

so i m guessing suicide 
and the alarm 
you know about that  right 
turns out the alarm company
has it being on
since the previous night 
before or after time of death 
too close to call 
guy clobbered his wife
to death with a vase

monica pinch 
so you are a detective 
where are all your possessions

this ends with you walking out
that door in a few minutes 
you sic warren gomes on me 
i assume you sent those kids

the palisades posse 
question is 
why do you want me to stay away
from the pinch case 
  i don t know who you are 
  have you met my wife 
but you just ruined my benefit 
and no doubt cost a very 
very important charity
tens of thousands of dollars 
now  i want you to go release
those two men

that one man s ear
from the other man s backside 
i ll do that 
my husband will show you
to the tennis courts 
you ll find those men there
and your chain 
  thank you 
  asshole 
she seems very nice 
this has been delightful 
the wall past the next house
backs out onto mulholland 
if you d be so kind
as to not cause any more drama
in the party 
tell me who warren gomes is 
gomes is dead 
what are you talking about 
i just spoke with the police 
someone shot him
just before you arrived 
it wasn t you  per chance 
was it 
why don t you tell me
what he was doing for you 
warren gomes has    had
a talent for special research 
which allows my company
to make what it makes 
which is 
money 
so gomes was digging up dirt
to help you buy the network 
why do you want me to stay away
from pinch 
i believe that s for you 
waldo 
waldo 
alastair 
rosario 
alastair 
where s alastair

things are getting
fucking strange

anything to you 
no  but robert blake

and asked if i want
to play pinochle on thursdays 
you do realize that everyone

busting my horns 
and me figuring out why
is the only thing
standing between you
and a life sentence 
when i ask for help 
i don t know 
maybe you should fucking help 
simmer down 
how could i be of service 
is there anything
you re not telling me 
like what

  could you invite someone
over to the house

and not remembered the next day 
when did you move
the furniture around 
i told you  monica was
a constant tinkerer 
she was never finished   
the night table
in my room doesn t fit

of the murder
unless you moved it since 
i have not moved them since 
piss off

handsome devil 
you remember
having mates  don t you  waldo 
not like you 
there you go 
you were right  of course 
i am shit faced 
more than usual 
chin chin 
you know what you should have
done when your young man died 
you should have gone on
an epic two week pub crawl 
gotten it all out
of your system 
to self pity 
hm 
that was a powerful observation
coming from the master 
you and i are two sides
of the same coin  aren t we 
and now  here you are 
back among the living
in a way you weren t
just a week ago 
mm 
  oh  you see a difference 
  mm 
all the difference in the world 
dicking refuckulous the way
you confronted me out there 
you didn t have that in you when
you first shuffled onto my set
with that rat s nest of a beard
and those dead eyes 
you ve been brought back
to life  mate 
like so many of us   
by singular carnal charms 
is jayne keeping the baby 
i think about her all the time 
but i haven t thought it right
to telephone 
given the circumstances 
and i was such a cad 
especially after she told me 
but i was married  after all 
and what was i to do 
and then after the business
with my sweet monica   
i m tired  waldo 
fearing that you may not be
as good as others believe 
it s common to all men 
but fearing that deep down
you may be a monster   
   that s a whole different
flavor of hell 
ladies and gentlemen 
we are about to begin 
please find your seats 
hey 
hey 
you should have told me
about you and alastair 
there s nothing to tell 
he s a kindergarten dad 
don t worry  it s not alastair 
it s me 
i found this burner
in his house 
on the night his wife died 
he texted back and forth
with someone  inviting her over 
someone    who said
she d be right there 
come on 
let s talk 
did you have a thing
with swag doggg too 
yes 
and that crazy rich guy
jamshidi 
you know 
i ve been getting beaten up
and threatened all week
because of you 
it had nothing to do
with monica pinch 
it was a bunch of rich guys
that didn t want their affairs
with you exposed 
what do you want  waldo 
i m a thrill seeker  and i m
teaching fucking kindergarten 
and what could be a bigger rush
than sleeping with the detective
investigating a death
you re involved in 
it wasn t just that 
i really felt something 
start from the beginning 
and no bullshit 
i was hoping that he would leave
his wife 
but he was an asshole 
and he kept talking about
how she wanted him to move back
to england with her 
like  he didn t give a shit
about what i was telling him 
and after that 
total radio silence 
but i kept texting him 
which was    probably stupid 
and then one night  he   
he messaged me back
saying that   
that monica was out of the house
and i should come over
and we could talk about us 
and before i can even ring
the bell 
monica opens the door
and tells me to come inside 
she s holding his phone 
she s the one who messaged me
to come over 
she tells me alastair s
passed out in the study and   
she wanted to see who it was 
when she found out
it was her daughter s teacher 
she got pretty unhinged 
kept talking about   
   how l a  was this evil city
and   
what a mistake it was
coming to l a 
i was scared
she was gonna get violent  so   
i just ran out of there 
i drove away 
and then   
   the next day 
i heard monica was dead 
and i tried reaching out
to alastair 
but    he was even more
of an asshole 
he wouldn t talk to me 
not even when he was
dropping gaby off 
so   
well  when the    when the chips
started falling on him   
   i just let them fall 
and you re pregnant 
alastair s 
jayne 
we re about to start 
yeah 
be right there 
can we pick this up later 
after the play and lawyers 
there s her necklace
and her ring 
next i ll take the child
as the king 
today i brew 
tomorrow i bake 
and then the prince child
i ll take 
for no one knows
my little game 
and rumpelstiltskin is my name 
to guess my name 
she ll never guess 
jayne 
that girl from  louisiana law  
what s her name  yeah 
i need you to call her agent 
i mean  is she pregnant
or is it   
i don t know  she s unhappy 
 cause it s weird 
i mean 
i don t know if she changed
what she s eating  but   
you tell me 
but they re feeding her
something very  very strange 
 cause i have never seen a shape
quite like that 
waddling through the lot 
and i i was like 
 it s not gonna work 
i don t want to look at that  
all right 
well  you tell him 
all right  bye 
mr  waldo 
mr  sikorsky 
apologies for the interruption 
but i made some progress 
oh  you did 
fantastic 
what is that 
that  my friend  is signed
by every quarterback
who ever won two super bowls 
may i 
please 
be my guest 
may i also say it is so good
to see your baby face
peeking out
where once a dead animal lay 
and just when you thought i
couldn t get any more handsome 
i have a run through  but  um   
fuck  em 
i want to hear this 
shoot 
it s good news  i guess 
i know who killed monica pinch 
fantastic 
i mean   
mm 
there s a young lady
named jayne white 
she was the pinch girl s
kindergarten teacher 
what d a kindergarten teacher
want to kill monica pinch for 
she and alastair were having
an affair 
you don t look surprised 
they had a complicated marriage 
well  you knew them pretty well 
knew them well 
we did st  bart s last year 
i m just so fuckin  relieved
it s not alastair  you know 
  i m sure you are 
  i knew you were my guy 
fontella said 
 don t hire that bum 
he stinks in every way  
but i was like   no 
that s my guy  
and do i know casting
or do i know casting 
is this chick in custody 
are we good 
  jayne 
  yeah 
no 
  no  she left town 
  ah  we ll find her 
she s a fuckin  kindergarten
teacher  not whitey bulger 
that s a win win for waldo
and sikorsky 
you get the killer 
i get to keep my syndication 
i mean  it s a tragedy  but 
you know  as tragedies go   
  mm 
  but thank you 
you know  great job and   
did you know jayne white 
i know of her 
did you know that alastair
had gotten her pregnant 
  hey 
  i m just wondering
if that was something
many people were aware of 
many people  no 
this is inner circle stuff 
right  but   
you re in the inner circle 
i founded the inner circle 
you know  he knows what i m
doing  if you know what i mean 
i know what he s doing 
if you know what i mean 
so what was monica pinch s
reaction
when she found out
jayne white was pregnant 
  she was devastated 
  i bet 
i mean  she probably
pushed alastair even harder
to quit the show
and move back to england 
i can t speak to that
 cause i don t know her
  as well as i know him 
  right 
but you knew about the awards 
the shakespeare awards
you talked about 
they re called regis 
by the way 
what did you say 
you said they were all
under the bed 
under the bed  in the attic 
doesn t matter 
he just didn t want them around 
ah  gotcha 
it s funny 
  they were under the bed 
  so 
it s just alastair said
he wasn t sure where they were 
  it s not a big deal 
  listen 
this is great chatting with you 
but time is not my friend 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
i ll let you go 
thanks 
monica pinch 
  quickly 
  monica pinch 
now  she didn t find out
that jayne white was pregnant
until the night she died 
so if she talked to you
about it 
it must have been then  right 
uh  i m gonna have to back you
up a second there  mr  waldo 
you said that jayne white
was the murderer 
oh  no  i said i knew
who the murderer was 
oh 
warren gomes 
does that name mean anything
to you 
  no 
  well  he was this lawyer 
i had a little bit
of a weird thing with him 
he kept following me
for a couple days 
and i kind of lost my temper
and i confronted him one day 
we got into a little fight 
a couple hours later 
he got killed 
yeah 
i m just trying to piece
everything together 
the question is   
why bring it up   
he had the same kind of watch
as you 
rich lawyer 
that s what i thought 
only i researched them 
they ll all individually made 
right 
no two are identical 
here s the thing   
the one he was wearing 
  it looked a lot like yours 
  pure coincidence 
this one hasn t left my wrist
except when i shower and sleep 
but you asked fontella
what time it was 
what  when 
at the courthouse
after alastair s arraignment 
i m afraid you must be mistaken 
but  uh   
oh  fuck it 
take a seat 
i want to hear everything
you re thinking 
soup to nuts  all right 
  soup to nuts 
  yes  please 
  double fuck the read through 
  let s do that  let s do it 
  you sure 
  yes  sir 
buckle up 
well  i m thinking   
   that you knew what
monica pinch kept under her bed
 cause you were spending time
in her bedroom
while alastair was spending time
with jayne 
mr  waldo 
that is brilliant 
i m thinking
that on the night she found out
that he d gotten jayne pregnant 
with alastair passed out cold 
i m thinking
that monica called you
to tell you she was gonna
tell alastair about your affair
to get him to quit the show
and move back to england 
like she d been wanting 
but you couldn t afford
to lose alastair 
not with the jamshidi
takeover threat 
i m thinking that you drove
over there 
you were gonna talk some sense
into monica 
but she didn t want to hear it 
next thing 
you guys are arguing 
it escalates 
and you pick up the regis award 
and you hit her with it 
you didn t mean to do it 
it s an act of passion 
thing is  she s hit her head
on the way down 
and now she s not moving 
so you panic 
and you start wiping down
everything you can remember
touching 
but the regis award
was on a wooden table 
and that had bloodstains on it 
now  i m thinking   
i m just thinking   
maybe you were worried that
some of that was your blood 
you could ve got cut
in the fight 
so now what do you do 
you swap around some furniture 
you set the alarm
on the way out 
you get rid of the regis
in some dumpster 
and you let poor old alastair
wake up to take the rap 
how did i do 
come on 
and the lawyer guy 
what   
he blackmailed you 
he even made you cough up
that fancy watch 
which you couldn t resist
taking back after you shot him 
huh 
that is quite brilliant 
in fact  i should give you
a pilot deal 
there is one gaping hole
in your narrative  however 
why would i sabotage the biggest
asset on this network 
come on 
that s the easy part 
you told me yourself
the scandal made the show
twice as valuable 
you knew alastair would get off 
i mean  it s l a 
the star always gets off 
and in the meantime 
the more publicity 
the bigger the windfall 
so what do you do 
you hire the lawyer
who ll make the most noise
and then the detective
who would make the most noise 
even though your lawyer
kept telling you
i d be a shitty choice 
and let s be honest 
i am a shitty choice 
i ve never been a p i 
the lapd fucking hates me 
i m so rusty 
i d probably be useless 
but i think you liked me
for those reasons 
 cause that made me
the last detective
who d ever figure out
that you killed monica pinch 
and warren gomes 
a lot of moving parts 
a lot of moving parts 
i do have one question 
what made you so sure
that you walk in here
and deliver that little pitch 
i ll be honest 
i only walked in 98  sure 
ah 
what was the other 2  
i had to make sure
you were a lefty 
i did make one mistake  though 
i really should ve waited
until the cops got here 
you    you told them to come 
well  if i timed it right 
they re already downstairs 
of course   
i don t have a watch 
after you 
yeah  you just keep smiling 
watch your haircut 
come on 
look alive  fellas 
pete couldn t make it himself 
you know he s not gonna let you
out of this collar  right 
i m gonna head
to north hollywood 
tell pete i ll meet him there 
see you in court 
what are you doing  
get off my bike 
we re not cops  man 
we re    we re extras 
shut the fuck up 
fuck  fuck 
ho ho ho  merry christmas 
fuck 
   lady justice 
make sure that
he isn t prejudiced
or predispositioned   
fuck 
 for 99 days  you do that 
and justice  in its natural
wisdom  will find its own way 
but  johnnie   he d say   
    on the 100th day 
a great judge knows
that he needs to be justice  
  ready for your close up 
  wait  wait 
    i do know
that as i sit here today    
how are you gonna get away
with this 
a light fell on set 
happens all the time 
last looks 
   and find
this here defendant    guilty 
what the fuck 
this place is fallin  apart 
waldo 
hey  q 
  well  that s that  then 
  yeah 
would it be ungrateful
to ask what you re doing here 
i ve been following you
since the recruiting office 
i even had to sit through
that rumpelstiltskin bullshit 
  really 
  yeah 
how d you get on the lot 
snuck in on a studio tour 
yeah 
they really need to check out
their security 
i could be  like  a crazy
stalker or something  you know 
i  uh  hope you don t mind 
i used your gun 
i was never here 
yeah 
i can work with that 
grand 
you do know why i saved
your ass  right 
  yeah  i got an idea 
  mm 
someone else kills you first 
i can t get what i want 
it ll be a mess 
nobody will know what to do
with themselves 
you know  i got to say  q 
it s not too clever
keeping your kind of business
records on a flash drive 
is that what cuppy thinks
is on there 
business records 
the guy s an idiot 
why 
what is on there 
epic poem 
long ass motherfucker  too 
it s the only copy i got 
epic poem that you wrote 
yeah  that i wrote 
  ah 
  it s about the life of a dealer
trying to retain
his independence and integrity
in an era
of corporate style cartels 
why an epic poem 
see  me  i m an autodidact 
means i m self educated 
i had to enrich my own life 
but my little girl  dulcy   
i m gonna make sure my daughter
gets a real education 
that way  she ain t stuck
being no cop  no dealer 
i want to give the poem to her
so she can see the man
i really am 
waldo  i need my mem 
i need lorena to come back 
so   
i ll tell you what 
i want you to get my little girl
into that fancy ass
private school 
same one as that
british dude s kid 
get him to help dulcy
and bring me back my mem 
and lorena can come back 
have you got the juice for that 
you know  i just might 
okay  waldo 
you got another 24 hours 
by the way 
i love johnnie s bench 
you know 
my granddaddy once said   
    it s one thing to write
like a poet   
   and another thing altogether
to write like a historian 
a poet can rehash
or sing about things
not like they were
but like they should have been 
and the historian   
   well  he s got to write
about them
not like they
should have been    
fuckin  lorena 
    but like they were   
   without adding or subtracting
anything from the truth  
and might i remind you 
counselor 
you re getting dangerously close
to rufflin  my feathers 
do you understand the words
 contempt of court  
come in 
aha 
the man of the hour 
come here 
deftly done  my old cockalorum 
no tongues 
come in  sit down 
sit 
i want to lavish praise on you 
is it too much of a cliché
to say   
i don t know how to thank you 
is it too much of a cliché
to say i might have an idea 
  shoot 
  i m thinking you were right
about that epic
two week pub crawl 
that s a brilliant idea 
unfortunately  as of today   
   this is my liquor of choice 
  sober as a judge 
  yes 
very good 
i may drop dead any second 
but at least now
i m not inviting it 
i made a shambles of everything 
waldo 
monica s gone 
jayne s run off with her son
or daughter    i may never know 
on the other hand 
i do have my sweet gaby 
and the least i owe her
is the best i have 
that could take more courage
than drinking yourself to death 
don t i know it 
courage  mate 
cheers 
  ready for you  mr  pinch 
  yes  let s off 
and  uh  don t tell anyone
about this 
if they think i m still a drunk 
they ll still let me paste
the occasional pretty boy 
i got your text 
thanks for squaring things
with q 
and yet all you talked about
was pinch 
i wanted you to do that  too 
i hope i didn t cause you
too much trouble 
oh  not at all 
i made some new friends 
well  if you re up for it 
i ve got something else
we could work together 
you know 
i don t think my face can take
much more of your action 
oh  stop being such a princess 
you know you loved
every minute of it 
you look good 
yeah 
you look pretty good yourself   
for a dead woman
