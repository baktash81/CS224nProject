not far from
the field of battle 
there was another sound   
soft and gentle   
yet it has echoed down the years
to be heard long after
the guns were stilled
and the battles forgotten 
if you listen closely 
you can hear it    now 
ahem 
well  grimm  how goes
the work today 
mr  gruber 
forgive me 
i didn t know you were here 
and does my presence
disturb you 
your hands are trembling 
my brother has not been feeling well 
mr  gruber 
his health is really not   
and still he continues to work 
what heroic devotion to duty 
it s    nothing 
on the contrary  grimm 
on the contrary 
his grace the duke
will be most grateful   
and find ways to show it 
uh  may i examine
the fruits of your labor 
but it isn t complete 
wouldn t you rather wait
until the entire manuscript   
no  no 
 and as he fell 
he ceased to be a frog
and turned into a prince
with beautiful  kind eyes  
and where does this event occur
in the duke s
family history  hmm 
well  i    i heard
this little story 
and while it was
fresh in my mind 
i thought i d borrow
just a few minutes 
borrow 
borrow 
you call it borrowing  do you 
stealing 
you are stealing from the duke 
who is paying you to
write his family history 
when you steal from the duke 
you are committing a crime   
for which he could
put you behind bars
like any other thief 
uh  need i say more  gentlemen 
don t be angry  jacob 
anger poisons the mind
and sours the stomach 
wilhelm  these are
perilous times 
work is hard to find
and money is scarce 
i swear    word of honor 
i m a reformed man 
you have a responsibility
to your wife  your children 
you re right  absolutely 
you see  i heard this wonderful 
wonderful story
from the old flower vendor   
i don t want to hear it 
about this beautiful
young princess
playing with a golden ball 
the ball falls into the well 
and she thinks it s lost   
when suddenly  a frog offers
to fetch it up for her 
but only if she ll invite the
frog to dinner  and then   
wilhelm 
off in the clouds again 
the poor moonstruck ninny 
the whole world on fire 
and he can t even smell the smoke 
forgive me  ladies 
but i do smell the smoke   
and the gunpowder 
true  the whole world is at war 
blood is flowing everywhere 
wilhelm 
real blood  ladies 
not dragon s blood 
which isn t harmful 
nor witch s brew 
which can turn an old hag
into a beautiful young princess 
that is my world  dear ladies 
if you prefer yours 
i beg you keep it   
with my fond blessings
and a cordial good day 
wilhelm 
i honestly believe
his mind is going 
gone  my dear  never to return 
that was the last gasp
from the old wilhelm 
from now on  you ll see 
jacob 
jacob grimm 
you see what he wants 
i ll go and buy the bread 
all right  but hurry 
we re late already 
jacob 
come here 
mr  grimm  don t you
want to buy a rose 
no  no  no 
thank you 
i have another one for you 
mr  grimm  a darling story   
no  no more stories 
about a funny little man
who spins gold out of straw 
spins gold out of straw 
no  no  no 
how does it go 
a pretty girl is locked
in the king s castle 
 spin this straw into gold  
he says   or you will die  
such a sweet story 
yes  yes 
go on  go on 
that s a little better 
now  if you could
possibly manage
to look a little
less gloomy  eh 
if you called me to
criticize my appearance   
no  my friend jacob  no 
your gloominess
is only a symptom 
now the diagnosis 
too much work  no pleasure 
too many hours alone 
look  i feel fine 
don t be absurd 
symptom  diagnosis   
and now  the cure 
i must   
miss greta heinrich 
may i present mr  jacob grimm 
i don t believe it   
a man so young 
why  i saw you on the street 
and it never entered my mind
that you could be jacob grimm 
the author of all these
marvelous works 
well  i    that is
not precisely true 
i collaborate with my brother 
ah  the married brother  yes 
you will be thrilled to know
that miss heinrich has
bought one of your books   
one that you wrote
all by yourself 
i can t wait to read it 
legal antiquities 
a marvelous choice 
old laws are so much
nicer than new ones 
i told miss heinrich
if she waited 
the author would write
something in the book 
yes  but   
what shall i write 
anything 
respectfully   
sincerely   
affectionately   
would it be all right
if i just signed my name 
oh  of course 
it s not the words 
but the thought that counts 
miss heinrich is
visiting from berlin
with her aunt 
doesn t know a soul in town 
there are many
young people here 
she won t be lonely 
well  thank you 
mr  grimm  you re very kind 
not at all 
jacob 
jacob  look 
i want to talk to you 
my brother wilhelm

stossel

everyone else 
oh  oh  yes 
yes  of course 
good bye 
good bye  miss heinrich 
thanks very much for coming in 
good day 
mr  stossel 
well  what s the matter

who goes out of her way
to buy one of his dull books 
to you they may be dull 
to everyone 
look here 
german grammar  volume 1 
german grammar  volume 2 
analysis of german grammar 
pfff 
as a good friend 
i give them space

i say to you

write about girls 
oh  about    you mean   
no  i mean about   
hmm  hmm  hmm 
but what do i know about girls 
nothing  about
everything that s important 
you know nothing 
stossel  don t you dare
talk to my brother like that 
jacob is the wisest 
most kind  most generous   
where is the bread 
the bread  oh  yes 
jacob  i wanted to talk
to you about that 
so you bought another story
from that villainous
flower vendor 
and the bread money is gone 
just this once  if you will lend
me some money  i promise   
well  i swear   
word of honor  never again 
you see  he s
a prince among men 
he s a fool 
next to you 
the biggest fool in the world 
but it s not too late to change 
for me  for your dearest friend 
please   
write about girls 
jacob  write about girls   
we are already 57 minutes late 
i hope you have an explanation 
have you ever known me when
i haven t had an explanation 
look  the reason we re late   
is we stopped to buy our roses 
we stopped 
our roses 
after all  you paid for them 
besides  you stopped to force
your attentions on a pretty girl 
i paid for the bread 
oh  no  no 
i insist  i insist 
you take half the
credit for the roses   
and half the blame
for being late 
daddy  daddy 
wait till you hear
what happened 
come on  come on 
oh    oh 
oh  help  help  help 
savages  mad dogs 
help  save me 
ooh  aha  aha 
now  my little pretties 
it s my turn 
i ll make you pay
and pay dearly 
i ll grind your bones
and snip off his arm 
and for you  my dear 
i have other plans 
where have you been   
for one whole hour that
dinner s been kept waiting 
what kept you 
what s this  wilhelm 
a tribute to your kind 
sweet  gentle  beauteous   
where s the bread 
bread  what bread 
children  go and wash
your hands  will you 
i gave you money for bread 
instead of which you
come back with    shh 
what am i to do  i don t have two children 
i have   
jacob  you should know better 
we ve barely enough money for   
for bread 
you didn t forget the bread 
no  dorothea  he didn t forget 
and don t you forget   
man does not live
by bread alone 
that s a strange
sentiment from you 
it s not from me 
it s from the bible 
and from stossel s bookshop 
you see  a young lady came in
and bought one of his books today   
asked him to write in it 
a very beautiful
young lady  eh  jacob 
i    i didn t notice 
well  she obviously noticed you 
what was her name 
do i know her 
um   
rita albrecht 
greta heinrich 
you see  that s our jacob boy   
can t remember a face 
but never forgets a name 
if dinner is ready 
why don t we eat 
oh  right away 
they re lovely 
they re just lovely 
it s my turn 
it is not 
it s my turn 
it was your turn yesterday 
no  it was your turn yesterday 
how could it be your turn today
if it was yours yesterday  
children 
you may share the honor 
bless us  o lord 
and these  thy gifts 
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty 
gruber    that shriveled husk 
he doesn t know the
meaning of the word  happy  
and as for our gracious patron 
the noble duke   
someone might hear
you and tell him 
good  it might
reduce his bloated ego 
might also throw us out of this house 
which he gives us rent free 
might also put you in jail 
you re right   
and so are you 
the duke doesn t want scholars 
he wants toadies   
to sing the glories of
his illustrious name   
so that he can be a toady
to the king of prussia 
however  we need the money 
so to work 
no  jacob  i ll go to work 
i m going to make up
for the borrowed time 
don t look so surprised 
i m a reformed man 
well  don t disturb
the children 
the children would be
wise not to disturb me 
what was he doing to make gruber angry 
hmm 
jacob  what was he doing 
just being himself 
not here 
now  let me see   
they must be there 
fooled you 
we fooled you 
shh  now  that s enough 
into bed  come on 
and to sleep  instantly 
come on  come on 
we want a story 
no  absolutely not 
oh  papa  just one 
no  no more stories 
no more stories  
not never 
 not never  
not ever 
you should be studying
your grammar 
 not never   why 
that s atrocious grammar 
well  grammar s too hard 
nothing s too hard 
son  nothing 
if you want it badly
enough  you ll get it 
now  remember the woodsman 
what he wanted was
impossible  nevertheless  he   
what woodsman 
well  you know    the woodsman
who lived in the forest
all alone 
what did he want so badly 
how did he get it 
well  it happened that on
a day    a very special day   
he decided to embark
on a great adventure 
a journey far from the
forest that was his home 
  i dream of winning
a princess  
  la la la la la la la  
ah

good morning  dear gypsy 
i ve come to bid

who told you 
the cards 
who else would ever speak to me 
what else did they tell you 
that your purse is empty   
and your heart s
full to overflowing 
with love for you 
no  not for me 
but for the king s daughter   
the loveliest flower
in all the land 
and you hope to win this flower 
i shall try 
good bye  gypsy 
woodsman  wait 
i have something for you 
no one has ever given me
a word of kindness but you 
when others have scoffed 
you alone have smiled 
give me one smile in return 
and i ll be happy 
that you shall have   
and something more 
hold out your hand 
hold out your hand 
now you see it   
and now you don t 
my hand 
take this cloak of invisibility 
it will hide you
from men s greed
and protect you from their envy 
will it help me
to win the princess 
that you ll never know
until you try 
you ll need this  too 
thank you 
bye  gypsy 
  i dream of
winning a princess  
  dreaming
a princess is mine  
  la la la la la
la la la la la  
  dreaming with love
less than mine  
he bows very well  doesn t he 
oh  very well  indeed

varlet 
knave 
your majesty

oh  that s wonderful 
that s marvelous 
a woodsman 
that means that you are
accustomed to the ax 
ha   to the ax  
uh  the rules 
ahem 
 he who    
discovers how my daughter   
 walks holes
through her slippers
every night    
without telling me
how she does it 
i tell you  another
pair every night 
it costs me a fortune 
uh  proceed 
 he who discovers the
why and wherefore    
gets half my kingdom 
oh  yes    and the princess  too 
now    tell him
the bad part 
 whoever shall
try and fail    
as all others have
tried and failed 
shall have his head separated
from his body for evermore 
aah

but please  my daughter s
very sensitive 
promise you won t tell her 
cross my heart and hope to die 
oh  delicious 
ha ha  delightful 
ha  good luck  woodsman 
but remember

your highness 
certainly not  fetch
the sleeping potion 
good evening  woodsman 
you may rise 
here s some warmth for the long 
cold night ahead 
is something wrong 
yes  yes 
i expected you to be beautiful 
am i not 
oh  no  princess

wine like this in the forest 
oh  i m sure you don t 
well  good night  woodsman 
excuse me 
pleasant dreams  woodsman 
don t forget

or the king will
surely find out 
aah 
coachman

but there is another man
waiting at the castle
that you must marry

so now we ll have
a great big party 
there ll be no party  i
shall never marry him 
tut  tut  tut  tut 
my girl  you re not the king 
you re only a princess 
which isn t as good 
besides  i gave my word 
and last night 
i gave my heart   
to a stranger 
and they lived
happily ever after 
shh 
well    i gave them
a severe talking to
about their grammar 
mm hmm 
well  i told them one story 
a story that will
give them nightmares 
oh  no  no  it was
a beautiful story   
about the dancing
princess and the woodsman 
you mean the tailor 
tailor  the way you heard it 
it was a tailor 
the way i heard it 
you were a reformed man

to make me feel guilty 
my object is to finish this
wretched thing on time 
mm hmm 
by the way   
you remember the story
of the dancing princess 
whom did she marry   
a woodsman or a tailor 
a farmer 
a farmer 
an honest  conscientious 
hardworking farmer 
a farmer 
it was a fisherman 
a fish   
how do you know 
because i m a man
of infinite wisdom
who has heard the story
a thousand times 
but that s terrible 
tailor  woodsman 
farmer  fisherman 
4 different versions 
now  isn t that terrible 
it is terrible 
come on 
you know  that proves my point 
these stories
should be written down 
better you should
write about girls 
talking about girls 
this greta heinrich   
yeah 
will you tell her
something for me 
wilhelm 
we ll be late 
i ll be there 
i ll be delighted

we hope  miss heinrich   
jacob and all of us   
that you like our town 
oh  i do 
the people are so friendly 
it must seem very quiet to you
after living in berlin 
still 
we hope    jacob and all of us   
that you won t hurry away 
well 
it was to have been just a short visit 
but i wouldn t mind
staying indefinitely 
wilhelm  it s getting late

hardly believe
what fantastic thoughts
occur to him 
go ahead  wilhelm 
let us have one of your stories 
funny    i just can t
seem to remember any 
oh  they come and go  slip away 
it s a pity there isn t
someone to write them down 
oh  well 
good night   
good night 
it was most kind of you
to take pity on a stranger
and invite me here 
to be honest 
it was not i who invited you 
i thought   
well  that is  i was
given the impression
that it was your idea 
say yes 
in all honesty  no 
it s a rare experience 
mr  grimm 
to meet a man so honest 
i shan t inquire whether
you wish to take me home 
but since it s getting late   
but  uh  honesty  miss heinrich 
requires the whole truth 
although it was not my idea 
i m very glad
you were invited here   
equally glad that you accepted 
tell me about
your work  mr  grimm 
oh  i   
no  jacob 
don t  please 
i d like to ask you a question 
miss heinrich   
a rather personal question 
how did you like my book 
oh  i was enchanted 
enchanted 
by legal antiquities 
oh  well  the subject
isn t important 
i beg your pardon 
what enchanted me was the
tremendous knowledge and intelligence
it took to write such a book 
forgive me  mr  grimm 
but i must be honest  too 
you are a brilliantly
fascinating man 
nonsense 
i m a conscientious scholar
dedicated to his
work  that s all 
aah 
gruber

of your grace s family history

a big  thick mustache 
and bushy eyebrows riding
on a sea of wrinkles 
he worked very hard 
day in and day out 
but for various reasons 
his customers were not pleased 
cobbler

which of you would

i can see you d rather
i made your blood run cold 
yes  scary 
scary story 
very well  a scary story
it shall be 
shh 
once upon a time   
long  long ago
in a faraway land 
there lived a huge
and fearful dragon 
he was as tall as the tallest
tree in the forest 
when he walked 
it was an earthquake 
when he breathed  a forest fire 
all the people lived in terror
of this monstrous beast
who had invaded their land
from no one knew where 
he ate up their crops 
devoured their cattle 
and carried off all the young
children to his lair 
what for 
dessert 
oh 
didn t anyone try to stop him 
of course  they did 
king sent north  south 
east  and west 
offering half his kingdom
to anyone who would
come and slay
this horrible beast 
many came to try
and earn the reward 
but the dragon sizzled them   
then he frizzled them 
then he gobbled them up 
and he picked his teeth
with their bones 
now it happened 
one fine day  that two men   
a knight named ludwig
and his servant hans   
set out in search
of adventure   
  o high am i  thirsting
and throbbing and bursting  
  in the relishing bask of
the ghastly adventure ahead  
  what sayest thou  red   
   cause you re
courageously  
  outlandish 
outrageously brave  
  why am i not daunted by fear
that would haunt the most fearless   
   cause you re outrageously brave
with a courage courageously peerless  
heh heh 
  and now  
  and now  
  we go  
  we go   
  to add a dragon
to my ego  
we re in luck  master 
the dragon s at home 
not so loud 
  a d r a  
  g o n  
  dragon  
  a 53 foot monster
snorting fire  
aaaahh 
  a 53  or maybe
even higher  
oooohh 
  i heard one thrashing
through the forest  
  crashing 
and it seems  
  a smashing day
to bag him  
  a d r a  
  g o n  
  dragon  
dragon

oh    well  we can t

oh  thank you  sir 
oh  oh  no 
is it too blood curdling 
children 
shall i stop 
no  it s only
make believe 
please 
don t stop 
don t stop 
please  go on 
very well  so    because he feared that
someone might discover it was the servant
and not the master
who had slain the dragon 
greedy ludwig killed hans and
buried him under the apple tree 
anna  voice over  while ludwig
went on to claim the reward
and dwell in a fine castle 
good hans lay
beneath the ground 
spring passed  and the earth s
breast was warmed
by summer s gentle touch 
autumn came  painting the leaves
with rainbow colors 
the north wind brought
winter into the land 
covering it with an icy
blanket of purest white 
and then it was spring again 
spring    a time of awakening 
with the dragon gone 
everyone felt safe again 
and the countryside flourished 
and so  one fine day  a shepherd
with his flock passed by the apple tree 
suddenly  he saw something
at his feet 
 with a bit of carving  
the shepherd thought 
 i could make a fine flute to
play on and soothe my flock  
straight away  he took out his
knife and began to whittle holes 
  oh  shepherd  
  listen to my tale  
  i sleep beneath the tree  
may i ask your majesty
why my presence was
requested here 
i have discovered a
new musical instrument
which i thought might amuse you 
as ruler of half your kingdom 
i would like to remind you
that i simply loathe music 
as ruler of the other half   
i suspect that you
will change your mind 
uh  shepherd 
will you play us a tune 
thank you so much 
some other time  perhaps 
  oh  king  pray listen
to my tale  
  i sleep
beneath the tree  
  my master ludwig
raised his sword  
  and drove it into me  
  i ll never walk
the earth again  
  or hear a bird
or plant a seed  
  till the man who
slew me says  
  he s sorry for the deed  
well  sir ludwig 
your majesty 
it was an accident 
you see  my sword slipped  and poor
hans happened to be directly underneath 
because it was poor
hans who slew the dragon
and not you  isn t that so 
yes  he was holding the
sword when it entered the beast 
mercy  your majesty  i
didn t know what i was doing 
mercy  i beg of you 
the court will pass sentence 
you have been found guilty
of the crimes of greed 
treachery  and murder 
the penalty is   
wait 
don t do anything hasty 
i m sorry i did it 
truly sorry 
i really am 
ooh 
well  fancy that 
my boy  you are just in time
to hear sentence
passed on an evil person 
hans  don t let
them kill me 
if you ll overlook that
one little incident   
i was always a good
master to you  heh heh 
it s true  your majesty 
he was a good master 
any bit of old clothing
he couldn t use 
he d give it to me 
and on a cool  bitter night 
he d let me sleep next to his nice 
warm horse 
and any scrap of food
his dogs wouldn t eat 
he d let me have them 
i implore you  your majesty 
spare his life 
so be it 
his life shall be spared 
thank you  your majesty 
well  help me up  crumpet face 
wait 
i have not finished 
you  ludwig 
shall spend the rest of your life
as servant to hans 
oh  no 
come here  my boy 
hans   
hereafter to be known
as sir hans  the dragon killer 
yay  yay 
oomph 
don t you worry  sir 
i ll be just as good a master
to you as you were to me 
thank you  sir hans 
yay 
   another one
like this

no  no

you must go home 
no  please 
no  no arguments

hmm  thank you 
i ll go and fetch a doctor 
no  no  get me
a hot cup of tea 
uh   
and have some yourself 
you re soaking wet 
thank you 
ah 
i told you to go away 
what were you doing outside 
listening 
you know    you shouldn t
live here all alone 
i m not alone 
death s been my
companion for some time now 
you ve many good years left 
i shall only regret
leaving the children 
but they ll remember me
because of my stories 
like their parents before them 
those stories don t just
belong to a few children 
they belong to children
all over the world 
now and forever after 
i like you  wilhelm grimm 
enough to tell me
some more stories 
but there are so many of them 
there s one about a little boy
that was no bigger than my thumb 
then there s
the poor little girl
whose face was always
covered in cinders 
and the other one 
whose skin was as white as snow 
would you like
another cup of tea 
no  no  just
the stories 
   when she saw
the blind prince 
she wept for joy 
two of her tears
fell into his eyes 
and suddenly 
he was able to see 
the boat    it must
be getting late 
i really must go 
how can i ever thank you 
you have  you have 
jacob  i   
the boat waited 10 minutes 
i went to the church 
i lost all track of time 
they told me you d left
over an hour ago 
that s true 
i did 
jacob  listen 
i    i found this
wonderful old woman 
the stories she tells   
what    if only you
could have seen
the happy faces
of those children
with their eyes wide
and their souls warm 
look  these   
these are pure gold 
you can t realize
how valuable they are 
we have worked over 6 months
on the duke s family history 
unless it s delivered
tomorrow  we won t be paid 
that s how valuable they are 
but we ll get there somehow 
we can hire horses   
or a coach 
we might even be able to
catch them on the next landing 
what s the matter 
where is it 
where s the manuscript 
i don t know  i   
i must have    i slipped
while crossing the river 
you fool 
6 months   
thrown away 
our whole career ruined 
but these are safe 
jacob  forgive me 
ask the duke to forgive you 
you ve always
an explanation ready 
go on  explain
to the duke 
but this time it s up to you 
because i won t be there 
i m not going back 
what  but    but
where will you go 
wherever i can
find work by myself 
i can t work
any longer with you 
you ruin everything you touch 
i know you don t mean it 
you you re very angry
and you ve every right to be 
but    well    we need you 
all of us 
i ve got needs of my own 
a wife  a home 
and time to do work that s important 
i ll never have anything
as long as i m tied to you 
jacob  jacob   
i m sorry  wilhelm 
but i m much more
sorry for your family 
with nothing
to live on but dreams 
it s not enough
to lose the manuscript 
not enough to rob me
of my gift to the king 
here s my poetry 
step on it 
wipe your boots on my face 
you and your
illustrious brother 
you are very pleased
to see me made ridiculous 
no  sir 
and you mustn t
blame my brother 
i m entirely responsible 
do you hear that 
he s a man of honor 
our minstrel 
takes full responsibility
for the crime 
brings to mind the old
saying  honor among thieves  
what shall i send to the
king of prussia instead 
a pretty basket full
of frogs and dogs
and hags and dragons 
your grace    may i
please be excused 
full responsibility you ll
take and full punishment 
to begin  you get no money 
i expect none  sir 
well what do you expect  answer 
your grace 
i    i can t think  i   
i could punish you in a way
you couldn t even imagine 
fortunately for you 
i m a civilized man 
i m very glad to hear that 
listen to him 
detect a note of sarcasm 
unmistakably  sir 
it wasn t meant to be 
for 6 months 
i ve given you a house rent free 
you owe me that rent 
and you ll pay 
i ll try  your grace 
you will not try  you ll pay 
i ll give you 3 days 
3 days 
if not  you ll be evicted
and sent to debtor s prison 
your grace  i can t 
it s impossible 
not in 3 days 
please wait 
your grace 
how is he  doctor 
is he better 
i can t truthfully
say he s better 
i can only say he s no worse 
no  not just words  doctor 
i want to know the truth 
in the morning 
we shall all know 
he s been ill before 
not this ill 
not for such a long time 
come 
such a fool  he is 
so little strength 
and he throws it away
chasing daydreams 
my father is not a fool 
oh  no  darling 
what mr  stossel means
is that it s foolish
for your father to give
so much of himself 
to    to be so unselfish 
that s what i mean 
the whole world should
be made of such foolishness 
it s late  it s time for bed 
greta  would you  
oh  of course

mr  gruber 
jacob  oh

darling 
oh  i m so glad you re here 
may i ask when the duke
will receive the money 
as soon as i sell my library 
sold  you ll get your money in the morning 
gruber 
or would you prefer to
put me in debtor s prison 
now please understand 
i m only obeying
the duke s orders 
we do understand 
if there were no duke 
there would be no gruber 
exactly 
if there were no dogs 
there would be no fleas 
this way

easy  you overgrown ox 
that s him 
please    go away 
i want to sleep 
you be quiet now 
he says he s dying 
we must be respectful 
why  why  is he
respectful to us 
please leave me alone 
you see  you see 
no respect at all 
he s mean and selfish 
you re a nasty little man 
nasty little man 
i am only nasty to
them what s nasty to me 
and nobody is nasty to me
until i m nasty to them first   
and that includes everybody 
he thinks he s clever
because he can spin
gold out of straw 
can he    really
do that 
stop talking about me  when
people talk about me  my beard itches 
and i can t stand
an itchy beard 
he has quite a temper 
hasn t he 
yes  and he really enjoys it 
why you little pipsqueak 
i could crush you under my foot 
do you    what is
your name  anyway 
i don t know 
what is my name 
how should i know 
you see 
 how should i know  
he doesn t care
whether we live or die 
all he s interested
in is himself 
and anybody who s only
interested in himself
is not interested
in anybody else  too 
i    don t know   
what you re talking about 
what he means  mr  grimm 
is that our lives depend on you 
if you die  we ll never be born 
we will never be born 
oh  now  stop that 
you promised if i brought
you along you wouldn t cry 
they re very sentimental 
mr  grimm 
and i m    i m so tired 
i have no more life left in me 
well  if you re going to die 
the least you can do
is give us names 
please  mr  grimm   
would you 
without names  we re nobody 
we re nothing 
please give us names 
please 
would that be asking too much 
mr  grimm 
well   
since you re   
no bigger than my thumb 
we ll call you   
tom thumb 
tom thumb 
tom thumb 
hooray  i got a name 
tom thumb 
your    face is dirty 
it s from cinders 
then you should be called   
cinder    ella 
cinderella 
i like that very much 
mr  grimm 
thank you 
and i 
you re    white as snow 
you re snow white 
thank you 
mr  grimm

mr  grimm 
hansel

you re   
little red riding hood 
thank you 
mr  grimm 
what about me 
you forgot about me 
don t i get a name 
rumpel   
stilt    skin 
why  that s ridiculous 
whoever heard of such a name 
rumpel    uh  rumpel   
what does it mean  anyway 
i    i can t see you 
all things die
differently  mr  grimm 
we die like dreams 
fade into forgetfulness 
no    don t 
you mustn t 
we haven t much more time 
when you reach
your last heartbeat 
we reach ours 
but it    it isn t fair 
why must this be
on my conscience 
say good bye 
good bye  mr  grimm 
good bye 
and thank you 
mr  grimm 
come back 
didn t you forget something 
bye 
tell them to come back 
tell them 
only you can call them back 
only you 
wait 
only you   
don t leave me 
only you   
where are you 
only you   
where have you gone 
wilhelm 
dear 
don t go in  i ll go 
jacob  i ve got to 
please let me 
it s gone 
the fever s gone 
what s this 
 once upon a    
 once upon a time 
there was a tiny little boy 
his name was tom thumb  
of course it s
difficult for him 
by his own admission 
the duke is a civilized man 
and if we go on paying our rent 
he will graciously permit us
to go on living in our house 
of course  he s raised
the rent  but   
well  that has
a strange sound to it   
as though you plan to
go on living there  too 
when my brother was ill 
i made him a promise   
that i would stay
and work with him 
you also made a promise to me 
they are very different 
one is   
you might call it a duty 
but it s much more 
the other much less 
no  darling 
but  i    i have only
so much money 
and the family has
to be taken care of 
but it s his family 
jacob  not yours 
he s my brother 
does that give him a claim
on your whole life 
i know he needs you 
but so do i 
oh  it s humiliating to beg 
but i don t care 
with you i have no pride 
if only you would wait awhile 
how long is a while 
a month  a year 
i don t know 
forever 
greta  i love you 
you love me and i love you 
and there s nothing more
to say  is there 
well  there s nothing
to be gained
by tormenting each other 
i m going home 
wait  i   
i ll take you 
not my aunt s home 
my home   
in berlin 
good bye  jacob 
jacob  where have
you been 
have you had supper 
i wasn t hungry 
i felt like walking 
this is for you 
your flower vendor
drives a hard bargain 
still  it s quite a good story 
it s about a    about a tailor 
who kills 7 with one blow 
7 flies  that is 
the townspeople misunderstand 
and they are amazed 
so am i 
i thought that fairy tales
were just a waste of time 
yes  i   
it s true  i did feel that way 
how do you feel
about greta heinrich 
miss heinrich and i have
reached an understanding 
i know 
she came to say good bye 
she was crying 
good byes are sentimental
occasions for women 
in fact  sentiment often
blinds them to practical matters 
uh huh  such as 
i need wilhelm
to complete my work 
he needs my help to
complete his stories 
we ll start first thing
in the morning 
good night 
what are you doing here 
we eanqna q orór
papa  can we   
not tonight 
papa s too tired 
oh  just one 
just a teeny weeny one 
no  you heard
your mother 
come along 
we ll never get to hear a story 
come along 
and no complaining 
and don t annoy your father 
he s been much too sick 
but he s better now 
shh  into bed 
i said 
i will tell you a story 
you don t know any stories 
you re wrong 
i just heard one today
from the flower vendor 
did you pay her 
what did it cost you 
what did it cost me 
enough 
ha ha ha ha 
wilhelm 
what is it 
what s the matter 
the duke  he s here 
he s downstairs 
well   
what s the trouble 
we pay the rent 
maybe he s raising it again 
more likely throwing us out 
why  that miserable   
don t keep him waiting 
you know what a temper he s got 
jacob 
my illustrious scholar 
my gifted man of letters 
i came here the moment i heard 
heard what 
how are you 
i m   
i m very much better  thank you 
i am happy to present
my distinguished protege 
jacob grimm
and his brother 
mr  vantino
from berlin 
the vantino 
very honored to meet you  sir 
how do you do  sir 
have you met our friend stossel 
we have been in communication 
i know all about it 
all about what 
silence 
silence 
i ve been commissioned
by his majesty 
wilhelm iii 
king of prussia   
a man of honor 
courage  wisdom   
a man i m humbly grateful to 
ahem 
continue 
to inform you gentlemen
that you have been
elected to membership
in the berlin royal academy 
did you hear that 
royal academy 
surprised  huh 
but not i 
i want you to know
i was the first
to recognize the talent 
i know all about it 
i told him 
oh 
the induction ceremony
will take place in berlin 
i present you now
with your certificate
of membership 
excuse me 
 in recognition of the literary
and scholarly excellence
 of the german grammar 
serbian grammar 
 legal antiquities 
 grimm s law of consonants 
latin poetry    
is something wrong 
no  it s   
it s just that there s no
mention of the fairy tales 
fairy tales 
never mind 
it s not important 
fairy tales 
ridiculous 
frogs and dogs
and hags and dragons 
frogs and dogs
and hags and dragons 
there s a sign 
what does it say 
berlin  we re getting
close to berlin 
we re almost there 
quiet  children 
now be quiet 
let uncle jacob read
what he s going to say 
uncle jacob knows
what he s going to say 
 members of the academy 
 i am deeply grateful
for this honor 
which  i regret to say 
is an outrage  
that s not very polite 
nor sensible 
it s your day 
stop resenting it 
look  whatever work
we performed 
we performed equally 
whatever honors are received
we should share equally 
you know  if you re not careful 
you ll also share
in my reputation 
such as looney  mad 
you re nothing of the sort 
neither is jacob  i hope 
we re being honored
for your work  not mine 
you were right about
the fairy tales 
they were a waste of time 
a quick reading 
quickly forgotten 
never mind that 
it is an outrage 
in my speech 
i m going to tell them that   
jacob 
just tell them   
just tell them that
i m your brother 
the berlin royal academy
welcomes you 
as president of   
we want a story 
we want a story 
we want a story 
we want a story

we want a story 
we want a story 
we want a story 
we want a story 
once upon a time
