not far from
the field of battle
there was another sound
soft and gentle
yet it has echoed down the years
to be heard long after
the guns were stilled
and the battles forgotten
if you listen closely
you can hear it now
ahem
well grimm how goes
the work today
mr gruber
forgive me
i didnt know you were here
and does my presence
disturb you
your hands are trembling
my brother has not been feeling well
mr gruber
his health is really not
and still he continues to work
what heroic devotion to duty
its nothing
on the contrary grimm
on the contrary
his grace the duke
will be most grateful
and find ways to show it
uh may i examine
the fruits of your labor
but it isnt complete
wouldnt you rather wait
until the entire manuscript
no no
and as he fell
he ceased to be a frog
and turned into a prince
with beautiful kind eyes
and where does this event occur
in the dukes
family history hmm
well i i heard
this little story
and while it was
fresh in my mind
i thought id borrow
just a few minutes
borrow
borrow
you call it borrowing do you
stealing
you are stealing from the duke
who is paying you to
write his family history
when you steal from the duke
you are committing a crime
for which he could
put you behind bars
like any other thief
uh need i say more gentlemen
dont be angry jacob
anger poisons the mind
and sours the stomach
wilhelm these are
perilous times
work is hard to find
and money is scarce
i swear word of honor
im a reformed man
you have a responsibility
to your wife your children
youre right absolutely
you see i heard this wonderful
wonderful story
from the old flower vendor
i dont want to hear it
about this beautiful
young princess
playing with a golden ball
the ball falls into the well
and she thinks its lost
when suddenly a frog offers
to fetch it up for her
but only if shell invite the
frog to dinner and then
wilhelm
off in the clouds again
the poor moonstruck ninny
the whole world on fire
and he cant even smell the smoke
forgive me ladies
but i do smell the smoke
and the gunpowder
true the whole world is at war
blood is flowing everywhere
wilhelm
real blood ladies
not dragons blood
which isnt harmful
nor witchs brew
which can turn an old hag
into a beautiful young princess
that is my world dear ladies
if you prefer yours
i beg you keep it
with my fond blessings
and a cordial goodday
wilhelm
i honestly believe
his mind is going
gone my dear never to return
that was the last gasp
from the old wilhelm
from now on youll see
jacob
jacob grimm
you see what he wants
ill go and buy the bread
all right but hurry
were late already
jacob
come here
mr grimm dont you
want to buy a rose
no no no
thank you
i have another one for you

no no no
how does it go
a pretty girl is locked
in the kings castle
spin this straw into gold
he says or you will die
such a sweet story
yes yes
go on go on
thats a little better
now if you could
possibly manage
to look a little
less gloomy eh
if you called me to
criticize my appearance
no my friend jacob no
your gloominess
is only a symptom
now the diagnosis
too much work no pleasure
too many hours alone
look i feel fine
dont be absurd
symptom diagnosis
and now the cure
i must
miss greta heinrich
may i present mr jacob grimm
i dont believe it
a man so young
why i saw you on the street
and it never entered my mind
that you could be jacob grimm
the author of all these
marvelous works

not precisely true
i collaborate with my brother
ah the married brother yes
you will be thrilled to know
that miss heinrich has
bought one of your books
one that you wrote
all by yourself
i cant wait to read it
legal antiquities
a marvelous choice
old laws are so much
nicer than new ones
i told miss heinrich
if she waited
the author would write
something in the book
yes but
what shall i write
anything
respectfully
sincerely
affectionately
would it be all right
if i just signed my name
oh of course
its not the words
but the thought that counts
miss heinrich is
visiting from berlin

young people here
she wont be lonely

stossel dont you dare
talk to my brother like that
jacob is the wisest
most kind most generous
where is the bread

flower vendor

jacob write about girls
we are already 57 minutes late
i hope you have an explanation
have you ever known me when
i havent had an explanation

we stopped
our roses
after all you paid for them
besides you stopped to force
your attentions on a pretty girl
i paid for the bread

i insist i insist
you take half the
credit for the roses
and half the blame
for being late
daddy daddy
wait till you hear
what happened
come on come on
oh oh
oh help help help
savages mad dogs
help save me
ooh aha aha
now my little pretties
its my turn
ill make you pay
and pay dearly
ill grind your bones
and snip off his arm
and for you my dear
i have other plans
where have you been
for one whole hour that
dinners been kept waiting
what kept you
whats this wilhelm
a tribute to your kind
sweet gentle beauteous
wheres the bread
bread what bread
children go and wash
your hands will you
i gave you money for bread
instead of which you
come back with shh
what am i to do i dont have two children
i have
jacob you should know better
weve barely enough money for
for bread
you didnt forget the bread
no dorothea he didnt forget
and dont you forget
man does not live
by bread alone
thats a strange
sentiment from you
its not from me
its from the bible
and from stossels bookshop
you see a young lady came in
and bought one of his books today
asked him to write in it
a very beautiful
young lady eh jacob
i i didnt notice
well she obviously noticed you
what was her name
do i know her
um
rita albrecht
greta heinrich
you see thats our jacob boy
cant remember a face
but never forgets a name
if dinner is ready
why dont we eat
oh right away
theyre lovely
theyre just lovely
its my turn
it is not
its my turn
it was your turn yesterday
no it was your turn yesterday
how could it be your turn today
if it was yours yesterday
children
you may share the honor
bless us o lord
and these thy gifts
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty
gruber that shriveled husk
he doesnt know the
meaning of the word happy
and as for our gracious patron
the noble duke
someone might hear
you and tell him
good it might
reduce his bloated ego
might also throw us out of this house
which he gives us rentfree
might also put you in jail
youre right
and so are you
the duke doesnt want scholars
he wants toadies
to sing the glories of
his illustrious name
so that he can be a toady
to the king of prussia
however we need the money
so to work
no jacob ill go to work
im going to make up
for the borrowed time
dont look so surprised
im a reformed man
well dont disturb
the children
the children would be
wise not to disturb me
what was he doing to make gruber angry
hmm
jacob what was he doing
just being himself
not here
now let me see
they must be there
fooled you
we fooled you
shh now thats enough
into bed come on
and to sleep instantly
come on come on
we want a story
no absolutely not
oh papa just one
no no more stories
no more stories
not never
not never
not ever
you should be studying
your grammar
not never why
thats atrocious grammar
well grammars too hard
nothings too hard
son nothing
if you want it badly
enough youll get it
now remember the woodsman
what he wanted was
impossible nevertheless he
what woodsman
well you know the woodsman
who lived in the forest
all alone
what did he want so badly
how did he get it
well it happened that on
a day a very special day
he decided to embark
on a great adventure
a journey far from the
forest that was his home
i dream of winning
a princess
la la la la la la la

good morning dear gypsy
ive come to bid

but for the kings daughter
the loveliest flower
in all the land
and you hope to win this flower
i shall try
goodbye gypsy
woodsman wait

a word of kindness but you
when others have scoffed
you alone have smiled
give me one smile in return
and ill be happy
that you shall have
and something more
hold out your hand
hold out your hand
now you see it
and now you dont
my hand
take this cloak of invisibility
it will hide you
from mens greed
and protect you from their envy
will it help me
to win the princess

until you try
youll need this too
thank you
bye gypsy
i dream of
winning a princess
dreaming

you are a prince in disguise
duke

he who
discovers how my daughter
walks holes
through her slippers
every night
without telling me
how she does it
i tell you another
pair every night
it costs me a fortune
uh proceed
he who discovers the
why and wherefore
gets half my kingdom
oh yes and the princess too
now tell him

whoever shall
try and fail

tried and failed

from his body for evermore

in all honesty no
its a rare experience
mr grimm
to meet a man so honest
i shant inquire whether
you wish to take me home

id like to ask you a question
miss heinrich
a rather personal question
how did you like my book
oh i was enchanted

fascinating man

i made your blood run cold
yes scary
scary story
very well a scary story
it shall be
shh
once upon a time
long long ago
in a faraway land
there lived a huge
and fearful dragon
he was as tall as the tallest
tree in the forest
when he walked
it was an earthquake
when he breathed a forest fire
all the people lived in terror
of this monstrous beast
who had invaded their land
from no one knew where
he ate up their crops
devoured their cattle
and carried off all the young
children to his lair
what for
dessert
oh
didnt anyone try to stop him
of course they did
king sent north south
east and west
offering half his kingdom
to anyone who would
come and slay
this horrible beast
many came to try
and earn the reward
but the dragon sizzled them
then he frizzled them
then he gobbled them up
and he picked his teeth
with their bones
now it happened
one fine day that two men
a knight named ludwig
and his servant hans
set out in search
of adventure
o high am i thirsting
and throbbing and bursting
in the relishing bask of
the ghastly adventure ahead
what sayest thou red
cause youre
courageously
outlandish
outrageously brave
why am i not daunted by fear
that would haunt the most fearless
cause youre outrageously brave
with a courage courageously peerless
heh heh
and now
and now
we go
we go
to add a dragon
to my ego
were in luck master
the dragons at home
not so loud
a dra
gon
dragon
a 53foot monster
snorting fire
aaaahh
a 53 or maybe
even higher
oooohh
i heard one thrashing
through the forest
crashing
and it seems
a smashing day
to bag him
a dra
gon
dragon
dragon

go ahead go ahead
oh thank you sir
oh oh no
is it too bloodcurdling
children
shall i stop
no its only
makebelieve
please
dont stop
dont stop
please go on
very well so because he feared that
someone might discover it was the servant
and not the master
who had slain the dragon
greedy ludwig killed hans and
buried him under the apple tree
anna voiceover while ludwig
went on to claim the reward
and dwell in a fine castle
good hans lay
beneath the ground
spring passed and the earths
breast was warmed
by summers gentle touch
autumn came painting the leaves
with rainbow colors
the north wind brought
winter into the land
covering it with an icy
blanket of purest white
and then it was spring again
spring a time of awakening
with the dragon gone
everyone felt safe again
and the countryside flourished
and so one fine day a shepherd
with his flock passed by the apple tree
suddenly he saw something
at his feet
with a bit of carving
the shepherd thought
i could make a fine flute to
play on and soothe my flock
straight away he took out his
knife and began to whittle holes
oh shepherd
listen to my tale
i sleep beneath the tree
may i ask your majesty
why my presence was
requested here
i have discovered a
new musical instrument
which i thought might amuse you
as ruler of half your kingdom
i would like to remind you
that i simply loathe music
as ruler of the other half
i suspect that you
will change your mind
uh shepherd
will you play us a tune
thank you so much
some other time perhaps
oh king pray listen
to my tale
i sleep
beneath the tree
my master ludwig
raised his sword
and drove it into me
ill never walk
the earth again
or hear a bird
or plant a seed
till the man who
slew me says
hes sorry for the deed
well sir ludwig
your majesty
it was an accident
you see my sword slipped and poor
hans happened to be directly underneath
because it was poor
hans who slew the dragon
and not you isnt that so
yes he was holding the
sword when it entered the beast
mercy your majesty i
didnt know what i was doing
mercy i beg of you
the court will pass sentence
you have been found guilty
of the crimes of greed
treachery and murder
the penalty is
wait
dont do anything hasty
im sorry i did it
truly sorry
i really am
ooh
well fancy that
my boy you are just in time
to hear sentence
passed on an evil person
hans dont let
them kill me
if youll overlook that
one little incident
i was always a good
master to you heh heh
its true your majesty
he was a good master
any bit of old clothing
he couldnt use
hed give it to me
and on a cool bitter night
hed let me sleep next to his nice
warm horse
and any scrap of food
his dogs wouldnt eat
hed let me have them
i implore you your majesty
spare his life
so be it
his life shall be spared
thank you your majesty
well help me up crumpet face
wait
i have not finished
you ludwig
shall spend the rest of your life
as servant to hans
oh no
come here my boy
hans
hereafter to be known
as sir hans the dragon killer

to you as you were to me

those stories dont just
belong to a few children
they belong to children
all over the world
now and forever after
i like you wilhelm grimm
enough to tell me
some more stories
but there are so many of them
theres one about a little boy
that was no bigger than my thumb
then theres
the poor little girl
whose face was always
covered in cinders
and the other one
whose skin was as white as snow
would you like
another cup of tea
no no just
the stories
when she saw
the blind prince
she wept for joy
two of her tears
fell into his eyes
and suddenly
he was able to see
the boat it must
be getting late
i really must go
how can i ever thank you
you have you have
jacob i
the boat waited 10 minutes
i went to the church
i lost all track of time
they told me youd left
over an hour ago
thats true
i did
jacob listen
i i found this
wonderful old woman
the stories she tells
what if only you
could have seen
the happy faces
of those children
with their eyes wide
and their souls warm
look these
these are pure gold
you cant realize
how valuable they are
we have worked over 6 months
on the dukes family history
unless its delivered
tomorrow we wont be paid
thats how valuable they are
but well get there somehow
we can hire horses
or a coach
we might even be able to
catch them on the next landing
whats the matter
where is it
wheres the manuscript
i dont know i
i must have i slipped
while crossing the river
you fool
6 months
thrown away
our whole career ruined
but these are safe
jacob forgive me
ask the duke to forgive you
youve always
an explanation ready

to the duke
but this time its up to you
because i wont be there
im not going back

where will you go
wherever i can
find work by myself
i cant work
any longer with you

jacob jacob
im sorry wilhelm

to live on but dreams
its not enough
to lose the manuscript
not enough to rob me
of my gift to the king
heres my poetry
step on it
wipe your boots on my face
you and your
illustrious brother
you are very pleased
to see me made ridiculous
no sir
and you mustnt
blame my brother
im entirely responsible
do you hear that
hes a man of honor
our minstrel
takes full responsibility
for the crime
brings to mind the old
saying honor among thieves
what shall i send to the
king of prussia instead
a pretty basket full
of frogs and dogs
and hags and dragons
your grace may i
please be excused
full responsibility youll
take and full punishment
to begin you get no money
i expect none sir
well what do you expect answer
your grace
i i cant think i
i could punish you in a way
you couldnt even imagine
fortunately for you
im a civilized man
im very glad to hear that

detect a note of sarcasm
unmistakably sir
it wasnt meant to be
for 6 months
ive given you a house rentfree
you owe me that rent
and youll pay
ill try your grace
you will not try youll pay
ill give you 3 days
3 days

not this ill
not for such a long time
come
such a fool he is
so little strength
and he throws it away
chasing daydreams
my father is not a fool
oh no darling
what mr stossel means
is that its foolish
for your father to give
so much of himself
to to be so unselfish
thats what i mean
the whole world should
be made of such foolishness
its late its time for bed
greta would you

the ones we love best
mama will it help
if we pray for papa

from the duke
regarding your husband
thats very thoughtful
of his grace
mrs grimm
the communication is an order
to evict your husband and
his family from this house
evict
a man who may
never see tomorrow
you cant do that
i must unless hes able
to pay 6 months rent

to raise his head
the duke has given the order

may i ask when the duke
will receive the money

put me in debtors prison

the dukes orders

your name anyway
i dont know
what is my name
how should i know

he doesnt care
whether we live or die
all hes interested
in is himself
and anybody whos only
interested in himself
is not interested
in anybody else too
i dont know
what youre talking about
what he means mr grimm
is that our lives depend on you
if you die well never be born
we will never be born
oh now stop that
you promised if i brought
you along you wouldnt cry
theyre very sentimental
mr grimm
and im im so tired
i have no more life left in me
well if youre going to die
the least you can do
is give us names
please mr grimm

please let me
its gone
the fevers gone
whats this
once upon a
once upon a time
there was a tiny little boy
his name was tom thumb
of course its
difficult for him
by his own admission
the duke is a civilized man
and if we go on paying our rent
he will graciously permit us
to go on living in our house
of course hes raised
the rent but
well that has
a strange sound to it
as though you plan to
go on living there too
when my brother was ill
i made him a promise
that i would stay
and work with him
you also made a promise to me
they are very different
one is
you might call it a duty
but its much more
the other much less
no darling
but i i have only
so much money
and the family has
to be taken care of
but its his family
jacob not yours
hes my brother
does that give him a claim
on your whole life
i know he needs you
but so do i
oh its humiliating to beg
but i dont care
with you i have no pride
if only you would wait awhile
how long is a while
a month a year
i dont know
forever
greta i love you
you love me and i love you
and theres nothing more
to say is there
well theres nothing
to be gained
by tormenting each other
im going home

the townspeople misunderstand
and they are amazed

were just a waste of time
yes i
its true i did feel that way
how do you feel
about greta heinrich
miss heinrich and i have
reached an understanding

she came to say goodbye
she was crying
goodbyes are sentimental
occasions for women
in fact sentiment often
blinds them to practical matters

youll also share
in my reputation
