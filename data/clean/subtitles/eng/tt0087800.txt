you coming back
to the sack or what 
hold your horses 
tina  honey  you got
to cut your fingernails   
or you got to stop
that kind of dreaming 
one or the other 
one   two   
freddy s coming for you 
three   four   
better lock your door 
five   six   
grab your crucifix 
seven   eight   
gonne stay up late 
nine   ten   
never sleep again   
it was so scary 
when i woke up   
it seemed like he was still
in the room with me 
sounds like a real bogeyman 
 one   two   
freddy s coming for you  
that s what it reminded me of  
that old jump rope song 
it was
the worst nightmare i ever had 
you wouldn t believe it 
as a matter of fact  i had
a bad dream last night myself 
i had a hard on this morning
when i woke up  tina 
had your name
written all over it 
there s four letters
in my name  rod 
how could there be room
on your joint for four letters 
hey  up yours
with a twirling lawnmower 
rod says the sweetest things 
he s nuts about you 
yeah  nuts  anyway   
i couldn t go back
to sleep last night 
so  what did you dream 
forget it  tina 
the point is that everyone has
a bad dream once in a while 
it s no biggie 
next time you re having one 
just tell yourself   
that s all it is
right while you re having it 
once you do that 
you wake right up 
at least  it works for me 
did you have a nightmare  too 
maybe we re going
to have a big earthquake 
they say things get
really weird just before 
i m so glad you guys
could come over tonight 
when my mom said she was taking
off for two days  i almost died 
no problem  tina 
nancy and glen to the rescue 
i can t believe his mother s
letting him spend the night 
right  well   she s not exactly 
see  i got this cousin
who lives near the airport 
it s ok for me
to stay with him 
and i got this
sound effects tape from rod  
hello  mom 
yeah  out here at barry s 
yeah  noisy as usual 
glad we don t live here  huh 
aunt eunice says hello 
i ll call you in the morning 
yeah  sure  
just some kids drag racing
outside  i think  mom 
listen  mom  i got to go 
i think there s been
an accident out front 
all right  i ll call the police 
i ll call the police 
just some neighbours having
a fight  i guess 
i m fine 
i ll call you in the morning 
it worked like a charm 
smooth 
jesus 
see  i told you
you d be feeling better 
all day long i ve been seeing
that guy s weird face   
and hearing those fingernails 
fingernails 
that s amazing you saying that 
that made me remember
the dream i had last night 
what did you dream 
i dreamed about a guy in
a dirty red and green sweater 
what about the fingernails 
he scraped his fingernails
along things 
actually  they were more like
finger knives   
something he made himself 
but they made a horrible sound 
it was like   
you dreamed
about the same creep i did 
that s impossible 
what 
nothing 
there s something out there 
isn t there 
i didn t hear anything 
i heard something 
i m going to punch out
your lights  whoever you are 
kitty  kitty 
chow  chow  chow 
it s rod lane
bringing lantz down   
just three yards
from the goal line 
what a brilliant tackle 
and the fans go wild 
what the hell
are you doing here 
came to make up  no big deal 
your mom home 
of course  what s that 
intense  huh 
what s going on here 
an orgy or something 
maybe a funeral  dickhead 
it s just
a sleep over date  rod 
tina and me 
glen was just leaving 
did you see his face 
your mom isn t home  is she 
me and tina
got stuff to discuss 
we got her mother s bed 
you guys got the rest 
i think we should
get out of here 
you guys are going
to hang around  right 
don t leave me alone
with this lunatic 
please  nancy 
glen  not now 
we re here for tina now 
not ourselves 
why is she so bothered
by a stupid nightmare anyway 
because he was scary 
that s why 
morality sucks 
i knew there was something
about you i liked 
you feel better now 
jungle man fix jane 
no more fights 
no more fights 
no more nightmares
for either one of us  then 
when did you have a nightmare

you know 
you isn t got a corner
on the market 
who do you think you are 
whoever you are 
somebody there 
who the hell is that 
shit 
please  god  
this   
is god 
watch this 
nancy  open the door 
rod  help me 
help me  rod 
who did this  i ll kill you 
who did this 
you scared me 
what have you got 
her name was tina gray 
it was her home 
father abandoned  10 years ago 
mother s in vegas
with a boyfriend 
we re trying to reach her now 
what s the coroner got 
something like a razor
was the weapon   
but nothing was found
at the scene 
it looks like
the victim s boyfriend 
lieutenant  where is she 
i put her in your office 
his name s rod lane 
he s a musician type 
he s been arrested for drugs 
brawling 
terrific  what the hell was she
doing there 
she lived there 
i don t mean her 
i mean you 
what was she doing there 
hello to you  too  donald 
marge  ok 
how you doing  baby 
i m ok  dad 
look  i don t want to get
into this now 
god knows you need time 
but i sure would like to know
what the hell you were doing   
shacking up with three kids
in the middle of the night   
especially a lunatic
delinquent like lane 
rod is not a lunatic  dad 
you have a sane explanation
for what he did 
apparently 
he was crazy jealous 
nancy said they d had a fight 
it wasn t that serious 
maybe you don t think
murder is serious 
how can you say i don t
take her death seriously 
look  all i meant   
was that their fights
weren t that serious 
you know tina dreamed
this was going to happen 
what 
she d had a nightmare that
someone was trying to kill her 
that s why we were there  mom 
she just didn t want
to sleep alone 
police say the victim 
15 year old christina gray   
had quarrelled earlier
with her boyfriend rod lane 
lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt 
the murder weapon   
a straight razor or similar
sharp object  has not yet  
where do you think you re going 
to school 
honey  you were tossing and
turning all night last night 
you have no business
going to school today 
i ve got to go to school 
mother 
otherwise  i ll sit up there
and go crazy 
did you sleep 
i ll sleep in study hall 
i d rather keep busy 
right home after 
right home after 
see you 
i m not going to hurt you 
they re going
to kill me for sure 
nobody s going to kill you 
did you do it 
i never touched her 
you were screaming like crazy 
there was somebody else there 
the door was locked
from your side 
don t look at me
like i m some fucking fruitcake 
i m warning you 
just move away from her  son 
real easy  like your ass
depended on it 
hold it 
jesus christ 
hold it right there 
watch it 
i m cool 
i got him 
on the ground  now 
come on  get down 
lieutenant  look at this 
a switchblade 
i didn t do it 
i didn t kill her  nancy 
daddy 
you used me 
what the hell were you doing   
going to school today for
anyway 
let go of my arm  
what is seen
is not always what is real 
according to shakespeare 
there was something operating   
in nature  perhaps inside human
nature itself  that was rotten 
 a canker   as he put it 
of course 
hamlet s response to this   
and to his mother s lies was to
continually probe and dig 
just like the gravediggers   
always trying to get
beneath the surface 
the same is true
in a different way   
in julius caesar 
john  will you go ahead  please 
 in the most high
and palm state of rome   
 a little ere
the mightiest julius fell 
 the grave stood tenantless   
 and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber   
 in the roman streets 
 as stars with trains
of fire and dues of blood   
 disaster s in the sun
and the moist air   
 upon whose influence
neptune s empire stands    
 oh  god  i could be
bounded in a nutshell   
 and count myself
a king of infinite space   
 were it not
that i have bad dreams  
where s your pass 
screw your pass 
hey  nancy 
no running in the hallway 
who are you 
gonne get you 
it s only a dream  
come to freddy 
god damn you 
ok  ok  thompson 
i ll call your mother 
everything is all right now 
come on  sit down 
i m ok 
i m fine 
you sure 
i ll go straight home 
you ll need a hall pass 
back to work 
and then what happened 
i told you 
it was dark  but i m sure
there was somebody in there   
under the covers with her 
how could somebody be under
the covers with you guys   
without you knowing about it 
how the fuck do i know 
i don t expect you
to believe me anyway 
what did he look like 
did you get a look at him 
then how do you know
that somebody else was there 
because somebody cut her
while i watched 
and you didn t get a look
at him 
i couldn t even see the fucker 
you could just see   
cuts happening   
all at once 
what do you mean all at once 
it was as if
there were four razors   
cutting her at the same time   
but invisible ones 
you know  i probably
could have saved her   
if i d have moved sooner 
but i thought it was
just another nightmare   
like the one i had
the night before 
there was this guy 
he had knives for fingers 
you think i did it 
one   two   
freddy s coming for you 
three   four   
better lock your door 
five   six   
grab your crucifix 
seven   eight   
gonne stay up late 
nine   ten   
never sleep   again 
what  mother 
don t fall asleep in there 
you could drown  you know 
oh  for pete s sakes 
it happens all the time 
i ve heated up
some warm milk for you  honey 
warm milk 
gross 
help 
hold on  baby 
mom  
i m ok 
 you re ok 
 i m ok 
but i heard you screaming 
you were calling me 
i just slipped getting out
of the tub  mom 
but i told you   
hundreds of people a year

i know  but i m ok  mother 
i m sorry for scaring you 
i ll turn down your bed 
i ll get my pyjamas on 
   the act of
bodily dismemberment 
i m sorry 
i saw your light was on 
i thought i d see how you were 
sometimes i wish you didn t live
right across the street 
will you shut up and let me in 
did you ever stand on a trellis
in your bare feet 
get inside before
somebody sees you 
i hit my head 
got to be quiet 
mom s not even asleep yet 
if you don t mind 
so  i heard you freaked out
in english class today 
yeah  i guess i did 
you haven t slept yet  have you 
not really 
what did you do to your arm 
i burned it in english class 
oh  god  i look 20 years old 
did you have
any weird dreams last night 
slept like a rock 
do you believe that people   
can dream about
what s going to happen 
no 
do you believe in the bogeyman 
no 
rod killed tina 
and you know that 
i ve got a crazy favour
to ask you 
it s nothing hard or anything 
i m going to go and look
for somebody   
and i want you to stand   
like a sort of a guard  ok 
now  you can t mess up 
a lot might depend on this 
i won t screw up 
turn off the light 
here s what we re going to do 
it s dark in here 
and it s not
what you re thinking 
are you still watching 
yeah  so 
i m just checking 
watch out 
watch out 
wake up 
are you there 
i m here 
nancy  help me  please 
save me from  
freddy 
this is just a dream 
this isn t real 
this is just a dream 
he isn t real 
glen  you bastard 
what did i do 
i just
asked you to do one thing   
just stay awake and watch me   
just wake me up if it looked
like i was having a bad dream   
and what did you do 
you shit 
you fell asleep 
oh  shit 
hurry 
shut up and stay there 
don t go away 
are you ok 
yeah  it was just
a little dream  that s all 
i m going right back to sleep 
call me if you need anything 
you mind telling me
what s going on 
just come on 
garcia  i ve got to see
rod lane again 
you know 
i took the night shift   
so i could get
some peace and quiet 
it s urgent 
we have reason to believe
that there might be   
something very strange
going on here 
got no argument with that 
what are you doing here 
there s an unsolved murder   
and i don t like
unsolved murders   
especially ones that
my daughter s mixed up in 
what are you doing here 
at this hour 
you should be home in bed 
i just want to see if he s ok 
nancy  take my word for it 
the guy s sleeping like a baby 
he s not going anywhere 
just go down and look at him 
please  daddy 
all right 
garcia  give me the keys 
right 
where the hell
did i put the keys 
help  help 
jesus 
cut him down 
grab his legs 
i got him 
grab his back  would you 
lower him 
ashes to ashes   
dust to dust 
may god be
with this young man s soul 
his life and his death   
attest to
the scriptures  warning   
that he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword 
but let us recall also
our lord s admonition   
that we judge not 
lest we be judged 
and may rod lane rest in peace 
time to go  honey 
hop in 
the killer s still loose 
you know 
you re saying somebody else
killed tina 
who 
i don t know who he is   
but he s burned 
and he wears a weird hat   
and a red and green sweater 
really dirty   
and he uses these knives 
like giant fingernails 
you better keep her home
for a few days   
until she really gets
over the shock of this 
i ve got something better 
i m going to get her some help 
i don t see why you couldn t
just give me a pill   
to keep me from dreaming 
everyone s got to dream 
young lady 
if you don t dream  you go 
all set 
please  nancy  trust us 
it s not you i don t trust 
it s just   
let s do it 
thank you  nurse 
how long has this been going on 
since the murders 
she was fine before that 
now she thinks
her dreams are real 
there s no sign
of pathology in her eeg 
i d guess that what we have
is just a normal girl   
who happens to have gone
through two days of hell 
she s asleep now 
thank god 
what the hell are dreams anyway 
mysteries 
incredible body hocus pocus 
the truth is we still
don t know what they are   
or where they come from 
she s going into deep sleep now 
heart rate is a little high 
it s just due to anxiety 
otherwise  she s nicely relaxed 
all signs are normal 
she could dream at any time now 
beta waves are slowing 
she s into rems now 
she s definitely dreaming now 
it s a good one  too 
typical dream parameter 
a nightmare now would be
plus or minus five or six 
she s about three 
doctor  what s she doing now 
is she asleep or awake 
something s wrong 
it never gets this high 
what s she doing 
i don t know 
is she dreaming 
nancy  it s mom  
what 
her hair 
excuse me 
this ll help you sleep 
oh  my god  her arm  
get something 
what happened  baby 
what happened 
it s ok 
i brought something out
from my dream 
where did you get that 
i grabbed it off his head 
she said she grabbed it off
his head in her dream 
no  i m not crazy 
i m holding the damn thing
right here in my hand 
i don t know where
she really found it 
i got to go 
you didn t sleep at all
last night  did you 
you know the doctor says
you have to sleep  or  
i ll go even crazier 
i don t think you re crazy 
and stop drinking
that damn coffee 
so  did you ask daddy
to have the hat examined 
i threw that filthy thing away 
i don t know
where you really found it   
or what you re trying to prove 
what i learned
in the dream clinic   
that s what i m trying
to prove  mother 
rod didn t kill tina 
and he didn t hang himself 
it s this guy 
he s after us in our dreams 
that s just not reality  nancy 
it s real  mama 
feel it 
give me that damn thing 
it even has his name
written in it 
fred krueger  mom 
do you know who that is  mother 
because if you do 
you better tell me   
because he s after me now 
nancy  trust your mother
for once  please 
you ll feel better
when you get some sleep 
feel better 
you call this feeling better 
or maybe i should grab that
bottle and veg out with you 
avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded 
fred krueger
can t come after you  nancy 
he s dead 
believe me 
i know 
you knew about him
all this time   
and you ve been acting like
it was something i made up 
nancy  you re sick 
there s something wrong
with you 
you re imagining things 
you ll feel better
when you sleep 
it s just as simple as that 
screw sleep 
it s just a nightmare 
that s enough 
whenever i get nervous  i eat 
and if you can t do that 
you sleep 
i used to 
not anymore 
did you ever read about
the balinese way of dreaming 
they got this whole system
they call dream skills 
so if you have a nightmare 
for instance  like falling 
right 
well  instead of screaming
and getting all nuts   
you say   i m going
to make up my mind   
 that i fall
into a magic world  
make it something special
like a poem or a song 
they get all their art
and literature from dreams 
just wake up and write it down 
dream skills 
what if they meet a monster
in their dreams 
they turn their back on it 
take away its energy 
and it disappears 
but what happens
if they don t do that 
then i guess those people don t
wake up to tell what happens 
great 
 booby traps   improvised
anti personnel devices  
what are you reading that for 
i m into survival 
see ya 
you re starting to scare me 
oh  gross 
mother 
what s with the bars 
security 
security from what 
not from what  from whom 
come down to the cellar with me 
and i ll tell you 
you want to know
who fred krueger was 
he was
a filthy child murderer   
who killed at least 20 kids
in the neighbourhood 
kids we all knew 
oh  mom 
it drove us crazy when we
didn t know who it was   
but it was even worse
after they caught him 
did they put him away 
the lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous   
but somebody forgot
to sign the search warrant   
in the right place   
and krueger was free
just like that 
what did you do  mother 
a bunch of us parents
tracked him down   
after they let him out 
we found him in
an old abandoned boiler room   
where he used to take his kids 
go on 
we took gasoline   
we poured it
all around the place   
and made a trail of it
out the door   
then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn 
but he can t get you now 
he s dead  honey 
because mommy killed him 
i even took his knives 
so it s ok now 
you can sleep 
oh  hi  how you doing 
fine 
stand by your window
so i can see you 
you sound a million miles away 
that s much better 
i see your mom went ape
at the security store today 
you look like the prisoner
of zenda or something 
how long s it been
since you slept 
it s coming up
on the seventh day 
it s ok  i checked guinness 
the record s 11 
listen  glen  i know who he is 
who 
the killer 
 you do

and if he gets me 
i m pretty sure you re next 
why would anybody
want to kill me 
don t ask 
just give me some help
nailing the guy   
when i bring him out 
bring him out of what 
my dream 
how do you plan to do that 
just like i did the hat 
have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up 
wait a minute 
you can t bring somebody
out of a dream 
if i can t 
then you can all relax   
because it s just a case
of me being nuts 
i can save you the trouble 
you re nutty as a fruitcake 
i love you anyway 
good 
then you won t mind
cold cocking this guy   
when i bring him out
