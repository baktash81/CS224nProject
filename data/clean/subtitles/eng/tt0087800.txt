to the sack or what
hold your horses

onetwo
freddys coming for you
threefour

it was so scary
when i woke up
it seemed like he was still
in the room with me
sounds like a real bogeyman
onetwo
freddys coming for you
thats what it reminded me of
that old jump rope song
it was
the worst nightmare i ever had
you wouldnt believe it
as a matter of fact i had
a bad dream last night myself
i had a hardon this morning
when i woke up tina
had your name
written all over it
theres four letters
in my name rod
how could there be room
on your joint for four letters
hey up yours
with a twirling lawnmower
rod says the sweetest things
hes nuts about you
yeah nuts anyway
i couldnt go back
to sleep last night
so what did you dream
forget it tina
the point is that everyone has
a bad dream once in a while
its no biggie
next time youre having one
just tell yourself
thats all it is
right while youre having it
once you do that
you wake right up
at least it works for me
did you have a nightmare too
maybe were going
to have a big earthquake
they say things get
really weird just before
im so glad you guys
could come over tonight
when my mom said she was taking
off for two days i almost died
no problem tina
nancy and glen to the rescue
i cant believe his mothers
letting him spend the night

the dream i had last night
what did you dream
i dreamed about a guy in
a dirty red and green sweater

fingerknives
something he made himself

you dreamed
about the same creep i did
thats impossible

her name was tina gray
it was her home
father abandoned 10 years ago
mothers in vegas
with a boyfriend
were trying to reach her now
whats the coroner got
something like a razor
was the weapon
but nothing was found
at the scene
it looks like
the victims boyfriend
lieutenant where is she
i put her in your office
his names rod lane
hes a musician type
hes been arrested for drugs
brawling
terrific what the hell was she
doing there
she lived there
i dont mean her
i mean you
what was she doing there
hello to you too donald
marge ok
how you doing baby
im ok dad
look i dont want to get
into this now
god knows you need time
but i sure would like to know
what the hell you were doing
shacking up with three kids
in the middle of the night
especially a lunatic
delinquent like lane
rod is not a lunatic dad
you have a sane explanation
for what he did
apparently
he was crazy jealous
nancy said theyd had a fight
it wasnt that serious
maybe you dont think
murder is serious
how can you say i dont
take her death seriously
look all i meant
was that their fights
werent that serious
you know tina dreamed
this was going to happen
what
shed had a nightmare that
someone was trying to kill her
thats why we were there mom
she just didnt want
to sleep alone
police say the victim
15yearold christina gray
had quarrelled earlier
with her boyfriend rod lane
lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt
the murder weapon
a straight razor or similar
sharp object has not yet
where do you think youre going
to school
honey you were tossing and
turning all night last night
you have no business
going to school today
ive got to go to school
mother
otherwise ill sit up there
and go crazy
did you sleep
ill sleep in study hall
id rather keep busy
right home after
right home after
see you
im not going to hurt you
theyre going
to kill me for sure
nobodys going to kill you
did you do it
i never touched her
you were screaming like crazy
there was somebody else there
the door was locked
from your side

on the ground now
come on get down
lieutenant look at this
a switchblade
i didnt do it
i didnt kill her nancy
daddy
you used me
what the hell were you doing
going to school today for
anyway
let go of my arm
what is seen
is not always what is real
according to shakespeare
there was something operating
in nature perhaps inside human
nature itself that was rotten
a canker as he put it
of course
hamlets response to this
and to his mothers lies was to
continually probe and dig
just like the gravediggers
always trying to get
beneath the surface
the same is true
in a different way
in julius caesar
john will you go ahead please
in the most high
and palm state of rome
a little ere
the mightiest julius fell
the grave stood tenantless
and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber
in the roman streets
as stars with trains
of fire and dues of blood
disasters in the sun
and the moist air
upon whose influence
neptunes empire stands
oh god i could be
bounded in a nutshell
and count myself
a king of infinite space
were it not
that i have bad dreams
wheres your pass
screw your pass
hey nancy
no running in the hallway
who are you
gonne get you
its only a dream
come to freddy
god damn you
ok ok thompson
ill call your mother
everything is all right now
come on sit down
im ok
im fine
you sure
ill go straight home
youll need a hall pass
back to work
and then what happened
i told you
it was dark but im sure
there was somebody in there
under the covers with her
how could somebody be under
the covers with you guys
without you knowing about it
how the fuck do i know
i dont expect you
to believe me anyway
what did he look like
did you get a look at him
then how do you know
that somebody else was there
because somebody cut her
while i watched
and you didnt get a look
at him
i couldnt even see the fucker
you could just see
cuts happening
all at once
what do you mean all at once
it was as if
there were four razors
cutting her at the same time
but invisible ones
you know i probably
could have saved her
if id have moved sooner
but i thought it was
just another nightmare
like the one i had
the night before
there was this guy
he had knives for fingers
you think i did it
onetwo
freddys coming for you
threefour
better lock your door
fivesix
grab your crucifix
seveneight
gonne stay up late
nineten

rod killed tina

ive got a crazy favour
to ask you

you mind telling me
whats going on
just come on
garcia ive got to see
rod lane again
you know
i took the night shift
so i could get
some peace and quiet
its urgent
we have reason to believe
that there might be
something very strange
going on here
got no argument with that
what are you doing here
theres an unsolved murder
and i dont like
unsolved murders
especially ones that
my daughters mixed up in
what are you doing here
at this hour
you should be home in bed
i just want to see if hes ok
nancy take my word for it
the guys sleeping like a baby
hes not going anywhere
just go down and look at him
please daddy
all right
garcia give me the keys
right
where the hell
did i put the keys
help help
jesus
cut him down
grab his legs
i got him
grab his back would you
lower him
ashes to ashes
dust to dust
may god be
with this young mans soul
his life and his death
attest to
the scriptures warning
that he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword
but let us recall also
our lords admonition
that we judge not
lest we be judged
and may rod lane rest in peace
time to go honey
hop in
the killers still loose
you know
youre saying somebody else
killed tina
who
i dont know who he is
but hes burned
and he wears a weird hat
and a red and green sweater
really dirty
and he uses these knives
like giant fingernails
you better keep her home
for a few days
until she really gets
over the shock of this
ive got something better
im going to get her some help
i dont see why you couldnt
just give me a pill
to keep me from dreaming
everyones got to dream
young lady
if you dont dream you go
all set
please nancy trust us
its not you i dont trust
its just
lets do it
thank you nurse
how long has this been going on
since the murders
she was fine before that
now she thinks
her dreams are real
theres no sign
of pathology in her eeg
id guess that what we have
is just a normal girl
who happens to have gone
through two days of hell
shes asleep now
thank god
what the hell are dreams anyway
mysteries
incredible body hocuspocus
the truth is we still
dont know what they are
or where they come from
shes going into deep sleep now
heart rate is a little high
its just due to anxiety
otherwise shes nicely relaxed
all signs are normal
she could dream at any time now
beta waves are slowing
shes into rems now
shes definitely dreaming now
its a good one too
typical dream parameter
a nightmare now would be
plus or minus five or six
shes about three
doctor whats she doing now
is she asleep or awake
somethings wrong
it never gets this high
whats she doing
i dont know
is she dreaming
nancy its mom
what
her hair
excuse me
thisll help you sleep
oh my god her arm
get something
what happened baby
what happened
its ok
i brought something out
from my dream
where did you get that
i grabbed it off his head
she said she grabbed it off
his head in her dream
no im not crazy
im holding the damn thing
right here in my hand
i dont know where
she really found it
i got to go
you didnt sleep at all
last night did you
you know the doctor says
you have to sleep or
ill go even crazier
i dont think youre crazy
and stop drinking
that damn coffee
so did you ask daddy
to have the hat examined
i threw that filthy thing away
i dont know
where you really found it
or what youre trying to prove
what i learned
in the dream clinic
thats what im trying
to prove mother
rod didnt kill tina
and he didnt hang himself
its this guy
hes after us in our dreams
thats just not reality nancy
its real mama
feel it
give me that damn thing
it even has his name
written in it
fred krueger mom
do you know who that is mother
because if you do
you better tell me
because hes after me now
nancy trust your mother
for once please
youll feel better
when you get some sleep
feel better
you call this feeling better
or maybe i should grab that
bottle and veg out with you
avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded
fred krueger
cant come after you nancy
hes dead
believe me
i know
you knew about him
all this time
and youve been acting like
it was something i made up
nancy youre sick
theres something wrong
with you
youre imagining things
youll feel better
when you sleep
its just as simple as that
screw sleep
its just a nightmare
thats enough
whenever i get nervous i eat
and if you cant do that
you sleep
i used to
not anymore
did you ever read about
the balinese way of dreaming
they got this whole system
they call dream skills
so if you have a nightmare
for instance like falling
right
well instead of screaming
and getting all nuts
you say im going
to make up my mind
that i fall
into a magic world
make it something special
like a poem or a song
they get all their art
and literature from dreams
just wake up and write it down
dream skills
what if they meet a monster
in their dreams
they turn their back on it
take away its energy
and it disappears
but what happens
if they dont do that
then i guess those people dont
wake up to tell what happens
great
booby traps  improvised
antipersonnel devices
what are you reading that for
im into survival
see ya
youre starting to scare me
oh gross
mother
whats with the bars
security
security from what
not from what from whom
come down to the cellar with me
and ill tell you
you want to know
who fred krueger was
he was
a filthy child murderer
who killed at least 20 kids
in the neighbourhood
kids we all knew
oh mom
it drove us crazy when we
didnt know who it was
but it was even worse
after they caught him
did they put him away
the lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous
but somebody forgot
to sign the search warrant
in the right place
and krueger was free
just like that
what did you do mother
a bunch of us parents
tracked him down
after they let him out
we found him in
an old abandoned boiler room
where he used to take his kids
go on
we took gasoline
we poured it
all around the place
and made a trail of it
out the door
then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn
but he cant get you now
hes dead honey
because mommy killed him
i even took his knives
so its ok now
you can sleep
oh hi how you doing
fine
stand by your window
so i can see you
you sound a million miles away
thats much better
i see your mom went ape
at the security store today
you look like the prisoner
of zenda or something
how longs it been
since you slept
its coming up
on the seventh day
its ok i checked guinness
the records 11
listen glen i know who he is
who
the killer

and if he gets me
im pretty sure youre next
why would anybody
want to kill me
dont ask
just give me some help
nailing the guy
when i bring him out
bring him out of what
my dream
how do you plan to do that
just like i did the hat
have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up
wait a minute
you cant bring somebody
out of a dream
if i cant
then you can all relax
because its just a case
of me being nuts
i can save you the trouble
youre nutty as a fruitcake
