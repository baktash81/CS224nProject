i don t care if you re the pope 
president of the united states 
man of the year 
something can all go wrong 
go ahead and complain 
tell your problems to your neighbor 
ask for help 
and watch them fly 
in russia they map it out so that
everyone pulls for everyone else 
that s the theory anyway 
but what i know about is texas 
and down here 
you re on your own 
he gave me a pearl handled 38
for our first anniversary 
think i better leave
before i use it on him 
i don t understand
how you can use it on him 
i m only an employee 
i ain t married to him 
it s just   
i don t know

but in this state
we got very definite laws about that 
second 
i m not a messenger

i ll be damned 
i couldn t believe it myself 
me  on the other hand 
i got lots of personality 
marty always said i had too much 
he was never big on personality 
he sent me to a psychiatrist
to see if he could calm me down 
yeah 
what happened 
  psychiatrist said
i was the healthiest person
he ever met  marty fired him 
i don t think
you can fire a psychiatrist 
i never saw him again 
i can tell you that  i said 
 marty  how come you re anal
and i gotta go to the psychiatrist  
what did he say 
nothing 
he s like you  he doesn t say much 
thanks 
except when he doesn t say things 
they re usually nasty 
when you don t 
they re usually nice 
you ever get tired 
  oh yeah  i guess
