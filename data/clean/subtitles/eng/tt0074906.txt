by the second year we had
8 000 texas half bred cattle
and over 3 500 volumes of
english literature in my library

over mavericks like today

now it s seven from rustling alone 
not to mention winterkill  calving loss

tops on the saddle to hold ammunition

 man  well  that s one of them 
his name was sandy chase and he came
here from rhode island with the army 
he was 24 years old 
we lost seven per cent of stock between
spring and fall last year  to rustlers 
you always mention the percentage 
i wonder why you do that 
this is my fourth frontier
and i know how they run 
i was in the california gold fields
before i was 18 
i was at the rush at alder gulch
and i went to south america 
these long ropers in the missouri breaks
are a mixed bag 
barbers from minneapolis 
failed grangers  scandinavian half breeds 
wolfers and woodcutters 
dishonest apprentices 
raftsmen  poisoners 
you give them a chance
and they ll waste everything 
you re astonished at my arrogance 
at not even having a trial  aren t you 
then why don t you get over it 
our situation has become
nearly as bad as it could be 
honey  pull down tristram shandy again
for me  would you 
daddy 
excuse me 
come on  giddap  yah

how d she go  tom 
everybody else been back a day 
brought in about 14 head
of the first class order 
yeah 
  hey 
  hey 
how was wyoming 
it was fine 
spent a couple of days in kc trying to
keep from associating with criminals 
why  they ve hit the union pacific
down there so many times
the place has begun to look like
a lawmen s convention 
they got two pinkerton in kc
and i do believe one of  em
was the legendary charlie siringo 
did he claim to be a border cowboy 
can t remember 
said he could talk mexican 
yeah  that s him 
how d you know it was a detective 
rancher s wife wanting to go to bed
with him  he kept givin  her a  no  
damned if i can understand that 
  well  i took care of her  cal 
  you did that  huh 
you re damn sure 
had a good time too  thank you 
did you 
spent the night in martinsdale 
couldn t get no credit at the whorehouse 
so i picked up this chubby little girl
off some sodbuster s outfit 
yeah    how was she 
about like a swiss clock  same exact
movement over and over again 
yeah 
  it was sandy  huh 
  yeah 
yeah 
sandy s gone  he s dead 
david braxton s foreman   
what s his name  cary 
  pete marker 
  pete marker 
   caught him and they hung him 
goddamn it 
i knew somebody s bunch
wasn t in that corral 
little tod was in town 
everybody was at the hanging 
  how d sandy go out 
  pretty good  pretty good 
they hung him up on a cottonwood 
though  and he sort of   
he sort of what 
sort of strangled for a while 
braxton was there dressed in a suit 
  lookin  like god 
  hah 
goddamn 
i ll tell you  the first time i met sandy   
listen at this  now 
the first time i met sandy 
he was rustling on his own 
he had a stolen cavalry pony
and he kept this dog 
as soon as he killed a steer  he d cut
the brand off and feed it to the dog 
he said to get enough
evidence to convict him
they d have to pick through
the dog s shit for a week
before they could find the brand 
my aunt ran a laundry in st paul 
got strangled by a chinaman
while she s washing her dog 
it s easy to die  easy 
well  they sure killed sandy 
he was the only comedian in this outfit 
every outfit oughta have a comedian 
you can t run that many rustled horses
across open ground 
i know i ve been saying that 
but you can t 
what do we do  tom  open up a stand
and sell stolen horses over the counter 
no  we gotta get a relay ranch
halfway across
so as we got somewheres
to relay  em at 
  that s right 
  that s just really great 
only we ain t got a ranch 
we ain t got no money 
the only horses we got are out there 
we can t move them across the breaks
without everybody knowing 
let s just stick up the np railroad
and buy a ranch 
hell  let s rob a bank 
if we re gonna get hung for rustlin  horses 
we oughta be robbin  trains 
why don t you boys join
that hole in the wall bunch
and you ll be around people
that think like that 
boy  a couple of years ago they d have
put sandy in red lodge penitentiary 
weavin  bridles 
seems like there s
something new in the air 
i bet you marker ll bait crows with sandy
for a week before he ll cut him down 
i worked for that son of a bitch once
on the reservation roundup 
he will leave sandy in the trees 
when we was fightin  in kansas 
we had relays all over the damn place 
we relayed a cousin of mine
all the way from medicine tree
to the hot springs in new mexico 
he beat the telegraph 
took the detectives two years to cover
the same ground he d covered in a week 
and when they got there
he was in his grave up on the chama 
why was you havin  to move
this cousin around so much 
he did card tricks 
i get it 
he done a trick for this nigger on
the chama  the nigger throttled him 
mm hm  i see 
say  cal   
why don t we put that relay
in braxton s backyard 
yeah

mornin   my little darlin  
hey  si  we ll see  em in church 
i think all of you working men and women
have had time now to consider
this case before us 
  there s braxton 
  i have reviewed its details 
and now i feel secure enough
to pronounce sentence 
subject  of course 
to your scrutiny and support 
 man  make him confess first 
i think the kindest thing
we can do to this bird
is to send him up to the territorial prison 
he s been about as cooperative
as any prisoner we ve tried around here 
  i see no direct call to hang him 
  don t he look like god 
who s got an opinion about
how long we might send him up 
   man  life is indicated 
   woman  he ll take anything 
how would 10 to 20 sound to you 
sounds about right to me 
how soon would i be eligible for parole 
  in about two weeks 
   laughter 
anything you d like to say
before we send you to your just deserts 
and if i may speak for the court 
we would prefer
that it be something colourful 
life on the frontier being what it is 
just that   
it may seem to you boys
like a hard way to make the papers 
but i m not ashamed of robbing that train 
of blowing bridges  sticking up banks  or
for my careless devil may care gunplay 
 laughter 
i m not ashamed of pissing away
the money on hard living either 
because i m that kind of guy 
but as a concession to me
for my cooperation 
i would like you all
to refer to me from now on
as  the lonesome kid  
especially in front of outsiders
here in the west 
that s enough of that  let s all go up
to the bar and make fools of ourselves 
 music starts 
yahoo 
 braxton  whoo  i haven t danced like that
since chicago 
i m tom logan 
i d like to congratulate you  sir 
on your treatment of that impostor 
oh    my daughter  jane 
hello 
people have told me
i should talk to you  mr braxton 
i just sold a family implement business
in the shonkin range
and i m thinkin  of buying a small ranch 
you done so well i d like
a piece out by you for good luck 
well    the cannon ranch is for sale 
isn t much  four sections and a cabin 
pole corrals around it 
but it s well watered 
and pretty fair shelter 
the owner s living in town now 
has a cooperage at the end of main 
past the livery 
i understand you had
some rustlin  problems 
seven per cent losses per annum 
you should know about that 
first year  that might just break you 
mm   
i understand
you had to hang someone here 
i did that 
oh  that s tough 
what was this 
some kind of a desperado 
no 
he was a thief  with probably a million
good reasons for being on hard times 
the main thing is that
we put him out of his misery 
don t you believe
in hangin  thieves  miss 
no  sir  i don t  do you 
i surely do  how in the world else
are we gonna have law and order 
well  what do you know 
maybe you can buy that cannon ranch 
get started in the cattle business 
with your attitude toward human life 
you may yet get to be
one of the barons of this prairie 
and have your picture on page one 
or page three  of the chicago papers 
and for your birthday you can have
a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice 
just the way the other hangmen
up this way do 
you sound bitter  lady 
you should have seen
that young man s face 
  he did not die quickly 
  i don t wanna hear about it 
i don t think you can really picture
the man s face 
i don t want to hear about it  miss 
thank you for your information 
mr braxton 
i ll go over to the cooperage and ask
mr cannon about them four sections 
pleasure to meet you too  miss

down there like that  please 
i spent my first 18 years
on one of these goddamn things 
workin  for my uncle that raised me 
i worked myself cross eyed too 
about the only thing i had for distraction
was this dog 
i d had the dog since it was ten years old 
and he shot it   
for stickin  its tongue on a pat of butter 
so i stayed one more night 
and i killed his seed bull 
i rustled every damn horse he had
including a racer that i sold as
a cow pony to an indian rancher 
and i took the whole damn remuda 
i come within a hair s breadth
of sendin  him to kingdom come 
i was that close to shootin 
that son of a bitch in the brainpan 
i never did have that kind of background 
never had nothin  neither 
my folks always wanted a place 
they was good people 
so i always saw it with their eyes 
i can see that 
but when you think about it  you wouldn t
want the weight of a damn place like this 
do you do alterations too  ma am 
nope 
and i don t do
your wire ripped shirts neither 
there you go 
si  you re beginnin  to sound
like a real old lady 
what do you say

you guys are soon gonna learn
to treat me nice 
  yahoo 
  whoa  watch it

everybody s so scared of the mounties
that nobody even tries 
the horses are hardly guarded 
  you talkin  to me about canada again 
  you re goddamn right i am 
them mounties scares me  cal 
hell  they scare everybody 
that s why it ll be so easy 
the indians won t touch them horses 
we can take all 60 of them ponies
at a walk 
all canadian government brand 
until we can get  em to the breaks for
modification  and then down here to relay 
that doesn t quite
settle it though  does it 
no  it don t 
someone s gonna have to stay here 
well  it isn t gonna be me 
it s gotta be one of the two of us 
and i ll tell you one thing 
you had all the fun on that train
while i baby sat these savages 
i m going to canada for sure 
that s settled  that s it 
 sighs 
i gotta stay on this
goddamn piece of ground 
goddamn  i can t even believe this 
that is pitiful 
you assholes will just get lost 
  he was the best foreman 
  he was the only foreman i ever had 
  pete marker was a hard man 
  he surely was  david 
he could break a horse better than
the bronc fighters  he could do every job 
he was a great ramrod 
he personified the american west
in the days of its rowdy youth 
  sure did 
  excuse me 
  lee clayton 
  oh  my god  you gave me a scare 
  all i could see was your horse 
  that was all you were meant to see 
is the owner about 
who may i say is calling 
lee clayton  i just said that 
i have a short memory 
well  i ll tell daddy that you re here 
and then i can get back
to what i was doing before 
tell him lee clayton from medicine hat 
wyoming  here on business 
  you got it 
  yes 
  come in  i ve been expecting you 
  oh  sir 
i don t know why it would not
have tired me more than it did 
to have travelled all this distance
without more than a catnap 
you ve a wonderful set of books here  sir 
  yes  i have 
  truly  truly beautiful 
i don t spend the time with them i should 
i m of the opinion    i would only claim
books that was about right from wrong 
otherwise how are we to find
our paradise among the stars 
true  please 
oh  sir  i m sorry for your trouble 
i wasn t aware 
gentlemen  robert e lee clayton 
i understand that you hung a thief
and neglected to find out where they were
caching the stock  how was that 
he didn t wanna talk  he was about to die 
oh  i see  then you pampered him 
  no  sir 
  we hung that man 
well  you pampered the man   
you pampered the man 
and the result of that
is the loss of this poor man s life 
  please  this is outrageous 
  you  you  you   
   woman screams 
  take your hands off 
realise the fact that as a result of that
this poor man has lost his life 
if you d invited me into the neighbourhood
before  it wouldn t have happened 
you ve got to give me some thoughts 
i m gonna turn my horse out 
then i ll wash my body 
and  miss   
the only thing not on my diet
would be the green top of the beet
and okra 
ladies and gentlemen  excuse me 
but i m under a severe attack from a tooth 
sir  miss 
  where d he come from 
  what was all that about 
i got recommendations for this man from
all the wyoming outfits he s worked for 
  i m assured that he s a top regulator 
  regulator 
  you mean you asked him up here 
  you re damn right i did 
they killed my ramrod
and i want them to pay for it 
i always wondered
what lee clayton looked like 
and smelled like 
i always figured him to be a little fella 
he s supposed to have a creedmore rifle
he carries as a saddle gun 
supposed to be able
to hit out to 500 yards 
  oh  mr rate  500 yards   
  i mean it 
he never carries a side arm 
so you know he s a dry gulcher 
but he smells like a wet gulcher
and he dresses like a clown 
he don t have no wife 
but he sure keeps himself spruced up 
many a rustler has said his prayers when
he got a whiff of them lavender bath salts 
 chattering and laughter continues 
  daddy  i wanna know how   
  not now  shh 
  vern  scat  out of here 
  you betcha  i will 
  adios  buddies 
  send you a postal card from canada 
cal  why can t i go to canada

  no good reason  i don t want company 
come on  give me a chance 
give you a chance 
give you a chance for what 
miss  i m gonna take this opportunity
to be just a little damn bit offended 
cos if there s anybody in this district
who s got a right to think of themselves
as wholesome companionship 
why  it s yours truly 
if you re such a wholesome companion 
what were you doing at the whorehouse 
who in the world told you that 
mary o connell 
that little blonde you paid for 
well  i hope that s all she told you 
she told me everything 
we re starved for news out here 
  all i ever hear about is grass 
  what s the matter with grass 
samuel johnson said
 a blade of grass is a blade of grass  
   tell me about a human being  
  i don t understand that 
it just means that samuel johnson
was as bored as i am with nature 
we had a famous painter
out here last year 
that man must have painted ten square
miles of canvas  not one human face 
i wish he d painted that boy sandy hangin 
up so decoratively against the mountains 
because his pink tongue and white face
would have set off
the green of montana splendidly 
i mean  it would have made the
damnedest bank calendar you ever saw 
well  you succeeded  this is where
i was coming to and you re still with me 
the persistence
of the young rancher  huh 
  well  i know what i want is all 
  what do you want 
i mean  i know what it is
when i want something 
  oh  come on 
   oh  come on  what 
  why don t you just say what you mean 
  this is what i mean 
  do you want me 
  what does that mean 
i mean you re followin  me around 
what you got in mind 
  me 
  sexual intercourse 
  oh  my   
  well  all right 
all right 
come on  get down off your horse 
i m not gonna have any hesitation from
you  not from a frequenter of whores 
all right  all right  just back off 
i m gonna step down at my own speed 
all right 
i m going to lose it right here 
in all these blades of grass 
do i have to come to you  all right 
  hold it 
  what 
who asked you to do all this 
  well  your entire behaviour   
  never mind that 
i didn t ask you 
you said that you wanted it 
  well  do you 
  no 
  well  you re not gonna get it 
  keep the dang thing  i don t want it 
  i forgot  you do have your whores 
  sure do  like  em too 
i ll tell you something  if you want them   
i keep tellin  ya  i want them a lot 
i don t want you at all 
why are you bein  so mean to me 
people have neglected to tell you
what a nasty little bitch you are 
and i m makin  up for their negligence 
i just seem mean 
i m only being thorough 
if you re gonna start that  i m gonna go
home and shovel manure on the pansies 
well  you just wait a minute
because i m gonna stop 
you gonna talk nice 
i will do my best 
you bastard 
  can i have a kiss 
  no  i hardly know you 
why don t we take a walk and talk about
the wild west and how to get out of it 
well    all right  i can talk about that 
cal  i forgot how to tie a diamond hitch 
  a squaw hitch is all you need 
  you ll be gone two weeks 
give or take a few days  cary  you re
gonna move some stock to make way 
  no more than two   
  or three at a time 
  i ve been doin  this for a while 
  i reckon you have  let s go 
keep low  boy 
hell of a damn way to ride off 
 yelling 
  stay with your horse 
  get a hold 
si  stay with your horse  si 
goddamn it  he knows what he s doing 
si let go of the rope 
oh  jesus 
  help 
  you re gonna drown 
help  get me in 
we did it  we crossed
that son of a bitch  didn t we 
i couldn t swim 
but i was swimmin   right 
i can  i did it 
we deserve a lot of damn credit 
we crossed the mighty mo
and i want some damn credit 
supposin  if the catfish
in that son of a bitch could eat a pig 
or a chicken 
get out 
  easy  now 
  tom 
hey  tom 
huh 
you re the only rancher
who hasn t met the new regulator 
tom logan  robert e lee clayton 
it s a pleasure
to make your acquaintance  sir 
damn near    sucked my boot off 
pleasure to meet you 
regulator   ain t that like a dry gulcher 
that s not the softest term
you could use  i d say 
well  a regulator   
correct me if i m wrong 
isn t a regulator one of these boys
that shoots people
and don t never get near  em 
that s it 
well  what about the binoculars 
what are they for 
well  i ve taken to watchin 
funny lookin  birds 
i see 
well  hell  i don t know 
i suppose if you didn t get a way off 
a mile or so to do the job 
you d just get messy like i done here 
easy  tom  don t let me down 
i ve just heard this from all the other
dreamers tryin  to ranch around here 
lee  did you ever hit a man from a mile off
while he was carryin  a pail of water 
a mile  well   
but i don t remember the pail 
no  sir 
when you hang a man 
usually he has a chance to talk 
or say goodbye  write a letter   
besides  a creedmore   
  it s a creedmore  isn t it 
  it is a creedmore  and a beautiful one 
must make a pretty good
mess of a human 
you hit a guy from 500 yards out  say 
why  the suddenness of it  he don t have a
few seconds to make his act of contrition 
and you never have to look him in the eye 
right there  that makes all the difference 
i would disagree  sir  the thing that
makes all the difference in the world
is the fact that it accomplishes
the task  you see 
this old boy in wyoming   
whoa 
this old boy in wyoming  he sat down
just to pull sandburs out of his trousers 
and his skull suddenly flew into pieces
about the size of your thumbnail 
that was the first time
i ever heard the term  regulator  
  that was the first time 
  first time 
what would be your line of work  sir 
i was in the implement business
up in the shonkin sag 
but i started back in the ranch
south of here 
you started back in  you was before    
my family used to have a place 
but when they lost it i hired out 
oh  i see 
i certainly wish you
good fortune  mr logan 
the times are hard on a small operator

  who 
  your ma

to my father for about three years 
weighed every word 
and then she up and ran off with the first
unreasonable man that she could find 
wait a minute  stop  this is a nice way
to ride  but i know a much better way 
where are you goin  
ooh 
  well  that is clever 
  yeah 
would you say that this is lewd conduct 
well  i couldn t say for sure 
my father has a library full of law books 
cos he believes in the law 
he says that we haven t got
any law up here yet 
what brings that to your mind 
because in one of those law books of his 
there s a whole section on lewd conduct 
  what about it 
  it s against the law 
are you an outlaw 
i m a jackpot rancher with a milk cow and
100 square foot of root vegetables  why

whoa

 distant singing 
 mounties    when the trumpet of the lord
shall sound and time shall be no more
  and the morning breaks
eternal  bright and fair
  and the chosen ones shall gather
over on the other shore
  and the roll is called up yonder
i ll be there
  when the roll is called up yonder
  when the roll is called up yonder   
now they ve locked in with jesus 
let s do it 
  makes me feel real safe and peaceful 
  well  that s what sundays are for 
 mounties sing
 bringing in the sheaves  
for the best police in the world 
mounties are dumber than sticks 
we just left  em nothin  
ha ha  whoo 
 scraping 
damn 
shouldn t crawl up on people like that 
well  i m not the crawlin  kind 
i was just passin  by and i thought
i d ask you a question or two 
there was a family of logans
out of kaycee  wyoming 
there was four brothers 
the youngest was a kid named lonnie 
they was all pretty quick 
except for lonnie  
he was a fiddle player  and   
they killed him off right quick 
some of the ranchers had found him
thievin  or something like that 
anyway  i was wonderin    
would they be kin to ya 
no  no 
well  i didn t think so
because you don t carry a gun 
no  i never carry a gun 
i never wear a gun neither 
oh  once in a while i carry
this little darlin  around 
she s almost like a poem 
you know  it s all hand done 
etched  you know  scratched in silver 
oh  she s a beauty 
made for the president of mexico 
i diverted it for a hundred dollar bill 
but it doesn t shoot worth a damn 
some damn fool came along
and filed off the top of the front sight 
and you have to sort of play with it 
it isn t easy 
have a look at the rope 
not bad 
there s one left 
i doubt it 
you re smart 
farmers ain t smart 
i don t know exactly where you came
from or what you were doing 
but i think you ought to go back to it 
because you can t farm worth spit 
unless    unless you lost your nerve 
in that case  cabbages
is just what the doctor ordered 
is your nerve gone 
 sings  is your nerve gone 
yah 
easy  easy 
we re home  boys  we ll bed down soon

you wait till the dawn comes 
about 4 30 and you re waitin 
outside by the barrels 
then you close the door real quick
and all the bats are inside 
then while they re sleepin  
the lovely little sweethearts 
you have every one of the dirty
little buggers at your mercy 
  that s the only way you can do it 
  that s all very informative
