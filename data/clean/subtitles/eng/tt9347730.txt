troy do not start with that

but why choose a place
that used to be called smokey hollow
then little hell then what is it
combat alley
whats it called now
man cabrinigreen
it was the projects
it was affordable housing
that had a particularly bad reputation
you would never know
because they tore it down
and gentrified the shit out of it
translation white people built the ghetto
and then erased it
when they realized they built the ghetto
oh no offense
none taken
troy they took the opportunity
to make it livable
i couldve got you a better conversion
they kept telling people
they were gonna make it better
moving em from place to place
but they were just tearing it down
so they could develop
everything around it
oh like here
you guys want to hear a scary story
no
troy too bad
troy clears throat
lights click off
but i voted no
troy
uhoh
oh my gosh
really
all laughing
this shit better be good
all laugh
this is a story
about a woman named helen lyle
she was a grad student
a white grad student
doing her thesis
on the urban legends of cabrinigreen
for research she came down
to cabrini a few times you know
asking questions
taking pictures of graffiti of people
and then
one day
she just
bee buzzing
snaps
she beheaded a rottweiler
blood dripping
by the time the police show up
shes in one of the apartments
doing snow angels in a pool of blood
ew
bullshit
troy
bullshit
where do you get this
she killed a rottweiler
this is extra even for you
there are articles written about this
look it up
bri scoffs
the authorities take her in
but she escapes almost immediately
she goes on a rampage
leaving a trail of bodies
in her wake and then
the baby of one of the residents
baby crying
is abducted
the mother is devastated
everyone is looking for him
and nothing
on the night of the annual bonfire
with all of the residents
of cabrini watching
people whispering
helen arrives
with a sacrificial offering
baby cries
baby in her arms
she runs towards the fire
but theyre on her quick
they say she was in a fugue state
fighting back blindly
but they got the baby free
fire crackling
while everyone is fussing over him
helen stands up
and walks right into the fire
and its on that spot that she dies
burns to death
right in the middle of cabrinigreen
helen laughing
is my rosé still in the freezer
you dont want the moscato
moscatos a dessert wine
man laughs

the trouble of replacing you
in the summer show
but youre the only person
who hasnt shown me what im putting up
im working on something
dig into that history of yours dude
im thinking about doing something
about the projects
and about how white supremacy
white people
yeah how it creates these spaces
of rampant neglect
for communities of color
in particular black communities
yeah like where youre from

camera beeps
police siren blares
siren wailing
man theyd almost never come
round here back in the day
unless it was to take someone in
chuckles but that was a long time ago
now they cant seem to stay away
at night they post up where
the last of us still live
a police car on either side of the block
keeping us safe
or keeping us in
youve lived around here for a while
uh since before the highrises came down
william william burke
anthony mccoy
clicks fingers
you need a hand
william home sweet home
ah the more things change
the more things stay the same
how you doing brother
ask the white people around here
about girl x dantrell davis
blank stares
one white woman dies in the hood
and the story lives on forever
its a good story i guess
you mind if i take some notes
pen clicks
makes you think about what could make
someone just snap like that
helen lyle was out here
looking for candyman
you ask me i say she found him
whats candyman
william for me candyman
was a guy named sherman fields
he had a hook for a hand
neighborhood character
used to stand there
and hand out sweets when i was a kid
one october
a razor blade shows up
in a little white girls halloween candy
police come around looking for sherman
but shermans gone
and one day i saw him myself
heartbeat thumping
candyman humming
william hed been hiding in the walls
screaming
screaming continues
we got a suspicious noise
thats when i saw the true face of fear
footsteps approaching
policeman muffled come on come on
go go go
go go come on lets go
shouting fades
muffled shouting
hurry come on go go go
footsteps approaching
over here
get out of here come on
indistinct shouting
william they swarmed him
policemen shouting
door shuts
killed him right there on the spot
bees buzzing
gunshot
screaming
what shows up a couple weeks later
more razor blades in more candy
thats when we knew
sherman had been innocent
harmless
but that wasnt the last we saw of him
knuckles crack
i dont know what to tell you
beshaw dropped out of my show
oh i told you months ago
to put her in rehab
you fix this
speaking in french
uh
continues speaking in french
uhhuh
uhhuh okay
speaks in french
whats up
you forgot your mothers
shit im sorry
will you please call that woman
tomorrow
you said that yesterday
and its nice that she wants
to spend time with you
not everyone has that
is she okay
she implied that i give you money
so you wont visit her
so shes about the same
sighs stop it
laughs thats great
i wanna show you something
uh
do i need to come upstairs
stay right there
all righty then
anthony shermans face was beaten
so badly that it was unrecognizable
and thats where the story started
about them seeing him around cabrini
about him coming to get you
over time his name disappears
and he just becomes the candyman
what do you think
well
its a pretty literal approach
not much room for viewer
interpretation you know
moving from the symbolism of violence
to the actual depiction of it
okay but how is it hitting you
its
painful
i feel really connected to this
ive never been this clear before
its like i know exactly
what im meant to be doing right now
babe thats great
and im sure clive will be
oh theres one more thing
the legend is
if you say his name five times
while looking in the mirror
he appears in the reflection
and kills you
so i thought
that we could
laughs what did you think
whispering summon him
scoffs
hell no
no
candyman
anthony
candyman
anthony no
candyman
stop stop it
candyman
stop it
okay
you better not do that last one
okay okay okay
whispers candyman
anthony you play too much
stop stop stop
what happened to your hand
fucking bee sting
really
yeah that shit hurt
mmm looks like it
kiss it
get the fuck outta here
help help
crowd chattering
camera clicking
we can go now
finally
last year we did a solo booth
at frieze la with jameson
phenomenal work
these are related works
but here hes recreating
and looping archival footage
bri just take your time
this is quite a departure
from your previous work
go ahead open it
im trying to align these moments in time
that exist in the same place
the idea is to almost
calibrate tragedy into a focused lineage
that culminates in the now
brianna
tell your boy not to hog the critic
hes got a whole thing
yeah no i know i heard it
its complicated
shes interacting with the piece
anthony the mirror invites you
to attempt the summoning yourself
huh
anyway i dont know why
im standing next to my own piece
like some kind of asshole
the work speaks for itself
oh it speaks all right
it speaks in didactic kneejerk clichés
about the ambient violence
of the gentrification cycle
but your kind are the real pioneers
of that cycle you know
excuse me
artists
artists descend upon
disenfranchised neighborhoods
divining cheap rent so they can
dick around in their studios
without the crushing burden of a day job
im gonna get another drink
should we try it
what
summon the candyman
uh yeah no black people dont need
to be summoning shit
come on that is nonsense
this isnt the bayou
in chicago thats white people shit
mmm
candyman candyman
zip it hey stop
candyman
stop it
man of course i did i owe brianna one
she introduced me to thelma golden
three years ago
brianna you still owe me one for that
laughs
and uh
ah snaps fingers
tony is it
i love interventionist strategy
conventional painting is such a drag
i love that you hid those fucking things
in a storage room
with the lights out so smart
is all your work based on found material
i mean whered you
even find those paintings
thrift store in the desert
laughing
i found them in the studio
where i painted them
laughing
you goofyass fuck
and you you fucking hyenas
oh what the fuck
hey lets go clive
anthony

on morningafter pills
to accommodate your summer intern program

stammering i know
thanks for coming
im so fucking over it
honestly if she cant control her man
woman she lost control
its like do i get a thank you no
do i get an apology for that display
atrocity exhibition
clive shoehorning her boyfriend
into my summer show was her first mistake
only mistake
sighs shes done
and she has no one to blame but herself
dont mix curation
with who youre fucking
woman laughs
love will tear us apart
jesus jerrica we get it

jerrica laughs
clive sighs

an8the murders occurred after
night driver gallerys group show opening
the bodies were discovered
in front of a piece
from rising star anthony mccoy
entitled say my name
law enforcement officers
say they are investigating
tv clicks off
say my name
they said my name
chuckles
and say my name
i dont know just
its cool to be mentioned i guess
i mean obviously
obviously its obviously its awful
troy really
rain pattering
bees buzzing
insects chirping
clive

anthony
anthony
are you okay
i had a bad dream
me too
what was it
what was what
the dream
ill be out ill be out in a minute
anthony
so i dont know what this is
or how you knew it existed
but this is everything
we have under helen lyle
i didnt thats why i had to ask
well here it is
thanks i appreciate it
of course
i found it filed under true crimes
workstudy undergrads are the worst
so are you a student
tape recorder clicks
woman some of the things that
have happened in cabrini over the years
violence just so extreme so bizarre
its almost as if violence
became a ritual
the worst part
the residents are afraid
to call the police
a code of honor perhaps
fear of the police themselves
the easy answer is always
candyman did it
the summoning game itself
could be connected
i mean its clear that
no one person makes this up
this grew from the communitys
collective subconscious
a survival tool evolved from the need
to protect itself
and its children
elevator dings
from the horrors of the community
bernadette and i tried the summoning
its amazing how effective it can be
the suggestion that
youre being followed or stalked
by something lurking
in your own reflection
but i get it
intoxicating inexplicably alluring
about the promise of seeing a ghost
almost as if
come on
elevator alarm rings
laughs
ringing stops
clattering
grunts ow
raspy breathing
raspy breathing continues
glass cracking
elevator whirs
woman giggles
hey
excuse me
woman on tape recorder and she heard
a noise do you remember her name
woman 2 i think
her name was ruthie jean
and she heard this banging and smashing
phone buzzing
like somebody was trying to make
a hole in the wall
so ruthie called 911
and she said theres somebody
coming through the walls
and they didnt believe her
woman they thought
the lady was crazy right
woman 2 mmhmm
so she called 911 again
and they still didnt believe her
and when they finally got there
she was dead
woman was she shot
woman 2 no
no she was killed with a hook
yeah
woman is it true
yeah it is i read it in the papers
buzzing continues
candyman killed her
woman yeah but
i dont know nothing about that
hello
im going out
we have the dinner tonight
i dont know how long ill be
jack hyde is coming in from new york
and he never comes to chicago
so please dont fuck this up
anthony ill be fine
brianna for me
dont fuck this up for me
indistinct chatter
man screaming
baby crying
doorbell rings
art critic
its been a crazy couple of weeks
that is putting it mildly
both laugh
as you can imagine what im writing is
no longer an exhibition review
its
its now expanded into a larger article
which impacts both the works
and the circumstances around the murders
i see
so i just wanted to get
a few quotes from you
well i dont know much of anything
your work is so macabre and thats
pretty interesting
considering what happened
thats a coincidence
im not saying that youre at fault
and im certainly not saying
that a ghost manifested
by collective storytelling
killed a prominent art dealer
im just saying that
all of a sudden your work seems
eternal
upbeat piano music playing
whats next
im expanding the work into a series
im hoping to do a solo show
all about candyman spread the word
mmm i love that idea
im surprised at how positive
your take on my piece seems to be now
well it grew on me
seemed like you didnt quite get it
no i get it
its the hood gentrification et cetera
artists gentrify the hood
who do you think makes the hood
the city cuts off a community
and waits for it to die
then they invite developers in
and say hey you artists
you young people you white
preferably or only
please come to the hood its cheap
and if you stick it out for a couple
of years well bring you a whole foods
you wanna be a part of the story right
well as a critic i
to really engage with the work
to get it
you should say it
say what
say his name
laughs
think i need to use the bathroom
oh this is as good a time as any
i dare you
sighs
clears throat
man on pa system doors open
to the right at state and lake
transfer to red line trains
at state and lake
tense music playing

raspy breathing
raspy breathing continues
bees buzzing

police siren wailing
distorted dialogue

clive literally had to die

jamesons doing a show
at my gallery in new york
i think its
the perfect opportunity for you
to spread your wings a bit more
come to the big city
i could introduce you to
the women of entre nous
if you decide on new york
wow thank you
ive actually been considering
going out on my own
dont you wanna focus
on working with artists
instead of chasing outstanding invoices
you can change the institution
from the inside
you should come by the museum some time
okay
i think id like that
phone buzzing
jameson oh my god
phones chiming
whats wrong
whats happening
finley stephens was found dead
in her apartment
danielle her husband found her
poor thing oh her husbands a suspect

anthony
gasps
anthony
anthony what is he
william candyman aint a he
candymans the whole damn hive
there are others
william samuel evans
run down during
the white housing riots of the 50s
william bell lynched in the 20s
but the first one where it all began
was in the 1890s
its a story helen found
the story of daniel robitaille
hed made a living touring the country
painting portraits for wealthy families
mostly white and they loved him
but you know how it goes
they love what we make
but not us
one day hes commissioned
to paint the daughter
of a chicago factory owner
who made his fortune in the stockyards
well
robitaille committed
the ultimate sin of his time
they fell in love
they had an affair she got pregnant
the girl tells her father and well
you know
he hires some men to hunt robitaille down
told them to get creative
chased him through here
in the middle of the day
he collapses from exhaustion
right near where the old tower
in chestnut used to be
they beat him tortured him
they cut off his arm
and jammed a meat hook in the stump
they smeared honeycomb
from the nearby hives on his chest
and let the bees sting him
a crowd started to form to watch the show
the big finale
they set him on fire
and he finally dies
but a story like that
a pain like that
lasts forever
thats candyman
so
hes real
bell is real
samuel sherman daniel robitaille
theyre all real
candyman is how we deal with the fact
that these things happened
that theyre still happening
get some rest young blood
youll feel better in the morning
anthony dont look at those
what the fuck is this
you shouldnt be looking at this
anthony we are beyond
sensitive artist bullshit

danielle weve been trying to move
in a fresher direction
for the past few years
and our last curator was a great guy
but just had a hard time getting there
brianna well ive certainly noticed
a shift in programming
since you started here
hopefully for the best
im so happy i finally got
to meet you at jacks dinner
yes hes been trying
to get us together before
its crazy about clive
i heard you were the one
to find the bodies
yeah
guide speaking indistinct
youve really emerged
as an interesting figure amidst all this
the show you put together
sounded so good too
you were so brave to embrace formlessness
actually there were a lot of bodies
figures in the show
like arnolds work
for so long abstraction has been about
indexing a sublimated emotional state
and i just wanted to focus on the body
of course but i mean
between the recent tragedies
and your fathers legacy
youve got a fascinating story
right
and your eye for emerging talent
how long have you worked
with anthony mccoy
just a couple years
my board members are buzzing
about mccoys work
feels like a project room show
is something we could start talking about
and of course any other artist
you have your eye on
reporter on tv the near north side
community once known as cabrinigreen
is stunned by the vicious mass murder
at golin college prep
police have found a startling link
to the art world murders
in particular a piece called say my name
which was written in the victims blood
on the bathroom wall
doctor welcome back mr mccoy
what
i saw in your file you were born here
i was born on the south side
no it says you were born here
voices whispering
regardless its good that
you came in when you did
we need to admit you immediately
for monitoring and do some more testing
rain pattering
knocks
door opens creaks
anthony where have you been
what happened to your hand
looks bad
went to river north memorial
near cabrini
they fixed me right up
youve been painting
chuckles
yeah ive been inspired a lot actually
by cabrini
sniffs you want some tea
i heard a story about a fire
killed a woman named helen lyle
a baby that was taken
something they used to call candyman
shushes
