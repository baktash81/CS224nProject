that used to be called smokey hollow 
then  little hell  then what is it 
combat alley 
  what s it called now 
   man  cabrini green 
it was the projects 
it was affordable housing
that had a particularly bad reputation 
  you would never know 
  because they tore it down
and gentrified the shit out of it 
translation  white people built the ghetto
and then erased it
when they realized they built the ghetto 
  oh  no offense 
  none taken 
 troy  they took the opportunity
to make it livable 
i could ve got you a better conversion 
they kept telling people
they were gonna make it better 
moving  em from place to place 
but they were just tearing it down 
so they could develop
everything around it 
oh  like here 
you guys want to hear a scary story 
  no 
   troy  too bad 
 troy clears throat 
   lights click off 
  but i voted no 
  troy 
  uh oh 
oh  my gosh 
really 
 all laughing 
this shit better be good 
 all laugh 
this is a story
about a woman named helen lyle 
she was a grad student 
a white grad student 
doing her thesis
on the urban legends of cabrini green 
for research  she came down
to cabrini a few times  you know 
asking questions 
taking pictures of graffiti  of people 
and then 
one day 
  she just 
   bee buzzing 
 snaps 
  she beheaded a rottweiler 
   blood dripping 
by the time the police show up 
she s in one of the apartments 
doing snow angels in a pool of blood 
  ew 
  bullshit 
  troy 
  bullshit 
  where do you get this 
  she killed a rottweiler 
this is extra  even for you 
there are articles written about this 
  look it up 
   bri scoffs 
the authorities take her in 
but she escapes almost immediately 
she goes on a rampage 
leaving a trail of bodies
in her wake and then 
  the baby of one of the residents 
   baby crying 
 is abducted 
the mother is devastated 
everyone is looking for him 
and nothing 
on the night of the annual bonfire 
with all of the residents
of cabrini watching 
   people whispering 
   helen arrives 
with a sacrificial offering 
 baby cries 
baby in her arms 
she runs towards the fire 
but they re on her  quick 
they say she was in a fugue state 
fighting back blindly 
but they got the baby free 
   fire crackling 
  while everyone is fussing over him 
helen stands up 
and walks right into the fire 
and it s on that spot that she dies 
burns to death 
right in the middle of cabrini green 
 helen laughing 
is my rosé still in the freezer 
you don t want the moscato 
  moscato s a dessert wine 
   man laughs

that s the guy that i gave a solo show to
straight out of grad school 
 sighs  look  i really don t want
to have to go through
the trouble of replacing you
in the summer show 
but you re the only person
who hasn t shown me what i m putting up 
  i m working on something 
  dig into that history of yours  dude 
i m thinking about doing something
about the projects 
  and about how white supremacy 
  white people 
yeah  how it creates these spaces
of rampant neglect
for communities of color 
  in particular  black communities 
  yeah  like where you re from 
  yeah  bronzeville 
  south side is kind of played 
uh  or cabrini green 
  i m hungry

  like the moon  playing 
 police siren wails 
 bee buzzing 
 camera shutter clicks 
 suspenseful music playing 
 car honks 
 camera beeps 
 rumbling 
 exhales 
 camera beeps 
 police siren blares 
 siren wailing 
 man  they d almost never come
round here back in the day 
unless it was to take someone in 
 chuckles  but that was a long time ago 
now they can t seem to stay away 
at night  they post up where
the last of us still live 
a police car on either side of the block 
keeping us safe 
or keeping us in 
you ve lived around here for a while 
uh  since before the high rises came down 
william  william burke 
anthony mccoy 
 clicks fingers 
you need a hand 
 william  home sweet home 
ah  the more things change 
the more things stay the same 
how you doing  brother 
ask the white people around here
about  girl x   dantrell davis 
blank stares 
one white woman dies in the hood 
and the story lives on forever 
it s a good story  i guess 
you mind if i take some notes 
 pen clicks 
makes you think about what could make
someone just snap like that 
helen lyle was out here
looking for candyman 
you ask me  i say she found him 
what s candyman 
 william  for me  candyman
was a guy named sherman fields 
he had a hook for a hand 
neighborhood character 
used to stand there
and hand out sweets when i was a kid 
one october 
a razor blade shows up
in a little white girl s halloween candy 
police come around looking for sherman 
but sherman s gone 
and one day  i saw him myself 
 heartbeat thumping 
 candyman humming 
 william  he d been hiding in the walls 
 screaming 
 screaming continues 
we got a suspicious noise 
that s when i saw the true face of fear 
 footsteps approaching 
 policeman  muffled  come on  come on 
go  go  go 
go  go  come on  let s go 
 shouting fades 
 muffled shouting 
hurry  come on  go  go  go 
 footsteps approaching 
over here 
get out of here  come on 
 indistinct shouting 
 william  they swarmed him 
 policemen shouting 
 door shuts 
killed him right there on the spot 
 bees buzzing 
   gunshot 
   screaming 
what shows up a couple weeks later 
more razor blades in more candy 
that s when we knew
sherman had been innocent 
harmless 
but that wasn t the last we saw of him 
 knuckles crack 
i don t know what to tell you 
beshaw dropped out of my show 
oh  i told you months ago
to put her in rehab 
you fix this 
 speaking in french 
uh 
 continues speaking in french 
uh huh 
uh huh  okay 
 speaks in french 
what s up 
  you forgot your mother s 
  shit  i m sorry 
will you please call that woman 
  tomorrow 
  you said that yesterday 
and it s nice that she wants
to spend time with you 
not everyone has that 
is she okay 
she implied that i give you money
so you won t visit her 
so  she s about the same 
   sighs  stop it 
   laughs  that s great 
i wanna show you something 
uh 
  do i need to come upstairs 
  stay right there 
all righty then 
 anthony  sherman s face was beaten
so badly that it was unrecognizable 
and that s where the story started 
about them seeing him around cabrini 
about him coming to get you 
over time  his name disappears 
and he just becomes the candyman 
what do you think 
well 
it s a pretty literal approach 
not much room for viewer
interpretation  you know 
moving from the symbolism of violence
to the actual depiction of it 
okay  but how is it hitting you 
it s 
painful 
i feel really connected to this 
i ve never been this clear before 
it s like i know exactly
what i m meant to be doing right now 
babe  that s great 
  and i m sure clive will be   
  oh  there s one more thing 
the legend is
if you say his name five times
while looking in the mirror 
he appears in the reflection
and kills you 
so  i thought
that we could 
 laughs  what did you think 
 whispering  summon him 
 scoffs 
hell no 
no 
candyman 
anthony 
  candyman 
  anthony  no 
  candyman 
  stop  stop it 
  candyman 
  stop it 
okay 
  you better not do that last one 
  okay  okay  okay 
   whispers  candyman 
  anthony  you play too much 
stop  stop  stop 
what happened to your hand 
  fucking bee sting 
  really 
yeah  that shit hurt 
mmm  looks like it 
  kiss it 
  get the fuck outta here 
help  help 
 crowd chattering 
 camera clicking 
  we can go now 
  finally 
last year  we did a solo booth
at frieze la with jameson 
phenomenal work 
these are related works 
but here  he s recreating
and looping archival footage 
 bri  just take your time 
this is quite a departure
from your previous work 
go ahead  open it 
i m trying to align these moments in time
that exist in the same place 
the idea is to almost
calibrate tragedy into a focused lineage
that culminates in the now 
brianna 
tell your boy not to hog the critic 
he s got a whole thing 
yeah  no  i know  i heard it 
it s complicated 
she s interacting with the piece 
 anthony  the mirror invites you
to attempt the summoning yourself 
huh 
anyway  i don t know why
i m standing next to my own piece
like some kind of asshole 
  the work speaks for itself 
  oh  it speaks  all right 
it speaks in didactic knee jerk clichés
about the ambient violence
of the gentrification cycle 
but your kind are the real pioneers
of that cycle  you know 
excuse me 
artists 
artists descend upon
disenfranchised neighborhoods
divining cheap rent  so they can
dick around in their studios
without the crushing burden of a day job 
i m gonna get another drink 
  should we try it 
  what 
summon the candyman 
uh  yeah  no  black people don t need
to be summoning shit 
  come on  that is nonsense 
  this isn t the bayou 
in chicago  that s white people shit 
mmm 
  candyman  candyman 
  zip it  hey  stop 
  candyman 
  stop it 
 man  of course  i did  i owe brianna one 
she introduced me to thelma golden
three years ago 
   brianna  you still owe me one for that 
   laughs 
and  uh 
ah   snaps fingers 
tony  is it 
i love interventionist strategy 
conventional painting is such a drag 
i love that you hid those fucking things
in a storage room
with the lights out  so smart 
is all your work based on found material 
i mean  where d you
even find those paintings 
thrift store in the desert 
 laughing 
i found them in the studio
where i painted them 
 laughing 
you goofy ass fuck 
and you  you fucking hyenas 
  oh  what the fuck 
  hey  let s go  clive 
  anthony 
  you think you d even be here
if it wasn t for her 
shouldn t you be stocking up
on morning after pills
to accommodate your summer intern program 
that s not spontaneous

i can take being called a bitch 
  it s fine  i m on a nuvaring 
   stammering  i know 
thanks for coming 
i m so fucking over it 
honestly  if she can t control her man 
 woman  she lost control 
it s like  do i get a thank you  no 
do i get an apology for that display 
atrocity exhibition 
 clive  shoehorning her boyfriend
into my summer show was her first mistake 
  only mistake 
   sighs  she s done 
and she has no one to blame but herself 
don t mix curation
with who you re fucking 
 woman laughs 
love will tear us apart 
jesus  jerrica  we get it 
you like joy division 
   jerrica laughs 
   clive sighs

 sighs  you tell me 
you proofread the press release  jerrica 
 clive   candyman  
but don t do it  okay 
i don t want you to die tonight 
at least  not until we

necrophilia s always been

mmm 
   shoes clatter

  an8 the murders occurred after
night driver gallery s group show opening 
the bodies were discovered
in front of a piece
from rising star anthony mccoy
entitled say my name 
law enforcement officers
say they are investigating   
 tv clicks off 
say my name 
they said my name 
 chuckles 
and say my name 
i don t know  just 
it s cool to be mentioned  i guess 
i mean  obviously 
obviously  it s    obviously  it s awful 
 troy  really

anthony 
anthony 
are you okay 
i had a bad dream 
me too 
what was it 
what was what 
the dream 
i ll be out  i ll be out in a minute 
anthony 
so  i don t know what this is 
or how you knew it existed 
but this is everything
we have under helen lyle 
i didn t  that s why i had to ask 
well  here it is 
thanks  i appreciate it 
of course 
i found it filed under true crimes 
work study undergrads are the worst 
so  are you a student 
 tape recorder clicks 
 woman  some of the things that
have happened in cabrini over the years 
violence just so extreme  so bizarre 
it s almost as if violence
became a ritual 
the worst part 
the residents are afraid
to call the police 
a code of honor  perhaps 
fear of the police themselves 
the easy answer is always 
 candyman did it  
the summoning game itself
could be connected 
i mean  it s clear that
no one person makes this up 
this grew from the community s
collective subconscious 
a survival tool evolved from the need
to protect itself
  and its children 
   elevator dings 
 from the horrors of the community 
bernadette and i tried the summoning 
it s amazing how effective it can be 
the suggestion that
you re being followed or stalked
by something lurking
in your own reflection 
but i get it 
 intoxicating  inexplicably alluring
about the promise of seeing a ghost 
almost as if 
come on 
 elevator alarm rings 
 laughs 
 ringing stops 
 clattering 
 grunts  ow 
 raspy breathing 
 raspy breathing continues 
 glass cracking 
 elevator whirs 
 woman giggles 
hey 
excuse me 
 woman on tape recorder  and she heard
a noise  do you remember her name 
 woman 2  i think
her name was ruthie jean 
  and she heard this banging and smashing 
   phone buzzing 
 like somebody was trying to make
a hole in the wall 
so  ruthie called 911
and she said   there s somebody
coming through the walls  
and they didn t believe her 
 woman  they thought
the lady was crazy  right 
 woman 2  mm hmm 
so  she called 911 again 
and they still didn t believe her 
and when they finally got there 
she was dead 
 woman  was she shot 
 woman 2  no 
no  she was killed with a hook 
yeah 
 woman  is it true 
  yeah  it is  i read it in the papers 
   buzzing continues 
candyman killed her 
 woman  yeah  but   
i don t know nothing about that 
hello 
i m going out 
we have the dinner tonight 
i don t know how long i ll be 
jack hyde is coming in from new york 
and he never comes to chicago 
so  please don t fuck this up 
 anthony  i ll be fine 
 brianna  for me 
don t fuck this up for me 
 indistinct chatter 
 man screaming 
 baby crying 
 doorbell rings 
 art critic 
it s been a crazy couple of weeks 
that is putting it mildly 
 both laugh 
as you can imagine  what i m writing is
no longer an exhibition review 
it s   
it s now expanded into a larger article 
which impacts both the works
and the circumstances around the murders 
i see 
so  i just wanted to get
a few quotes from you 
well  i don t know much of anything 
your work is so macabre  and that s 
pretty interesting 
considering what happened 
that s a coincidence 
i m not saying that you re at fault 
and i m certainly not saying
that a ghost manifested
by collective storytelling
killed a prominent art dealer 
i m just saying that 
all of a sudden  your work seems 
eternal 
 upbeat piano music playing 
what s next 
i m expanding the work into a series 
i m hoping to do a solo show 
all about candyman  spread the word 
mmm  i love that idea 
i m surprised at how positive
your take on my piece seems to be now 
well  it grew on me 
  seemed like you didn t quite get it 
  no  i get it 
it s the hood  gentrification  et cetera 
artists gentrify the hood 
who do you think makes the hood 
the city cuts off a community
and waits for it to die 
then they invite developers in
and say   hey  you artists 
you young people  you white 
preferably or only 
please come to the hood  it s cheap 
and if you stick it out for a couple
of years  we ll bring you a whole foods  
you wanna be a part of the story  right 
well  as a critic  i 
to really engage with the work 
to  get it  
you should say it 
  say what 
  say his name 
 laughs 
think i need to use the bathroom 
oh  this is as good a time as any 
i dare you 
 sighs 
 clears throat 
 man on pa system  doors open
to the right at state and lake 
transfer to red line trains
at state and lake 
 tense music playing 
ah 
 knocks  finley 
 shouts 
 raspy breathing 
 raspy breathing continues 
 bees buzzing 
are you all right 
  i thought 
  what 
i gotta go 
 thud 
 police siren wailing 
 distorted dialogue 
 man  muffled  really 
no one s buying it  not that i care 
careful 
i love being here 
it s so provincial  yet exciting 
oh  my god 
have you met danielle harrington 
  she s chief   
  curator at the mca 
i find it crazy that
we actually haven t met yet 
i ve been so eager to meet you 
don t you start already  i get first dibs 
clive literally had to die
for brianna to be free  sorry 
jameson s doing a show
at my gallery in new york 
i think it s
the perfect opportunity for you
to spread your wings a bit more 
come to the big city 
i could introduce you to
the women of entre nous
if you decide on new york 
wow  thank you 
i ve actually been considering
going out on my own 
don t you wanna focus
on working with artists
instead of chasing outstanding invoices 
you can change the institution
from the inside 
you should come by the museum some time 
okay 
  i think i d like that 
   phone buzzing 
   jameson  oh  my god 
   phones chiming 
  what s wrong 
  what s happening 
finley stephens was found dead
in her apartment 
 danielle  her husband found her 
poor thing  oh  her husband s a suspect 
  i have to go 
  anthony 
 gasps 
anthony 
 anthony  what is he 
 william  candyman ain t a he 
candyman s the whole damn hive 
there are others 
 william  samuel evans 
run down during
the white housing riots of the  50s 
william bell  lynched in the  20s 
but the first one  where it all began 
was in the 1890s 
it s a story helen found 
the story of daniel robitaille 
he d made a living touring the country
painting portraits for wealthy families 
mostly white  and they loved him 
but you know how it goes 
they love what we make
but not us 
one day  he s commissioned
to paint the daughter
of a chicago factory owner
who made his fortune in the stockyards 
well 
robitaille committed
the ultimate sin of his time 
they fell in love 
they had an affair  she got pregnant 
the girl tells her father  and  well 
you know 
he hires some men to hunt robitaille down 
told them to get creative 
chased him through here
in the middle of the day 
he collapses from exhaustion
right near where the old tower
in chestnut used to be 
they beat him  tortured him 
they cut off his arm
and jammed a meat hook in the stump 
they smeared honeycomb
from the nearby hives on his chest
and let the bees sting him 
a crowd started to form to watch the show 
the big finale 
they set him on fire
and he finally dies 
but a story like that 
a pain like that 
lasts forever 
that s candyman 
so 
he s real 
bell is real 
samuel  sherman  daniel robitaille 
they re all real 
candyman is how we deal with the fact
that these things happened 
that they re still happening

 danielle  we ve been trying to move
in a fresher direction
for the past few years 
and our last curator was a great guy 
but just had a hard time getting there 
 brianna  well  i ve certainly noticed
a shift in programming
  since you started here 
  hopefully for the best 
i m so happy i finally got
to meet you at jack s dinner 
yes  he s been trying
to get us together before 
it s crazy about clive 
i heard you were the one
to find the bodies 
yeah 
 guide speaking  indistinct 
you ve really emerged
as an interesting figure amidst all this 
the show you put together
sounded so good too 
you were so brave to embrace formlessness 
actually  there were a lot of bodies   
figures in the show 
like arnold s work 
for so long  abstraction has been about
indexing a sublimated emotional state 
  and i just wanted to focus on the body 
  of course  but i mean 
between the recent tragedies
and your father s legacy 
you ve got a fascinating story 
right 
and your eye for emerging talent 
how long have you worked
with anthony mccoy 
just a couple years 
my board members are buzzing
about mccoy s work 
feels like a project room show
is something we could start talking about 
and of course  any other artist
you have your eye on 
 reporter on tv  the near north side
community  once known as cabrini green 
is stunned by the vicious mass murder
at golin college prep 
police have found a startling link
to the art world murders 
in particular a piece called say my name 
which was written in the victims  blood
on the bathroom wall 
 doctor  welcome back  mr  mccoy 
what 
i saw in your file you were born here 
i was born on the south side 
no  it says you were born here 
 voices whispering 
regardless  it s good that
you came in when you did 
we need to admit you immediately
for monitoring and do some more testing 
 rain pattering

i heard a story about a fire 
killed a woman named helen lyle 
a baby that was taken 
something they used to call candyman 
 shushes 
don t 
don t say that 
you told me i was born on the south side 
i did raise you in the home you remember 
but you were born in river north memorial
and spent the first two years in cabrini 
why did you lie 
to protect you 
from what 
i just wanted you to grow up happy
and normal

 sighs 
when you first got taken 
i thought she was the one who did it

helen 
 fire crackling 
the way i found her in her apartment 
covered in blood 
we all thought she was crazy 
but it wasn t her 
it was him 
 fire crackling 
he had a purpose for you 
 baby cooing 
he chose you to be
one of his victims 
he wanted you to burn in that fire 
but she pulled you out 
and gave you back to me 
 chuckles 
   people clamoring 
   baby crying 
  i thought it ended that night 
   candyman  wait 
 anne marie  in the fire

and we vowed to never say his name again 
but

even if you wash it out

you can feel it 
a thinning  deep in the fabric 
this neighborhood got caught in a loop 
the shit got stained
in the exact same spot 
over and over 
until it finally rotted
from the inside out 
 gasping 
 william  they tore down our homes 
so they could move back in 
we need candyman 
 cause this time 
he ll be killing their fathers 
their babies  their sisters 
i knew it was only a matter of time
before the baby came back here 
in perfect symmetry 
a chance for candyman to take back
what s rightfully his
