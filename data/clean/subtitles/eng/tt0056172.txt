yes sir
what do you think about it
bloody marvellous sir well done
thank you mr perkins
sir

youre a clever man sir

we should do very well indeed
shouldnt we
easy gentlemen please
give us something to drink
of course sir
lm here at the invitation
of major lawrence
tracy
shall we go outside
so you hold bound the turkish
desert army
yes
with 1 000 arabs
with 1 000 arabs
1 000 arabs means 1 000 knives
delivered anywhere day or night
lt means 1 000 camels
that means 1 000 packs of high
explosives and 1 000 crack rifles
we can cross arabia while
johnny turk is still turning round
lll smash his railways
while he mends
lll smash them somewhere else
ln 1 3 weeks l can have
arabia in chaos
you are going back then
yes
of course lm going back
well if we can see it
so can the turk
lf he finds hes using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits
hell withdraw
he darent withdraw
arabias part of his empire
lf he gets out now
hell never get back again
l wonder who will
no one will
arabias for the arabs now
thats what lve told them anyway
thats what they think
thats why theyre fighting
oh surely
theyve only one suspicion
that well let them drive the turks
out and then move in ourselves
lve told them that thats false
that we have no ambitions in arabia
have we
lm not a politician thank god
have we any ambition
in arabia dryden
difficult question sir
l want to know sir
if l can tell them in your name
that weve no ambitions in arabia
certainly
2000 small arms not enough
l need five
right
money ltll have to be sovereigns
they dont like paper
lnstructors for the lewis guns
right
more money

25000 now a lot more later
dryden
lt can be done sir
a couple of armoured cars
right
field artillery
right
lll give you every
blessed thing l can
because l know youll use it
congratulations
thank you for your hospitality
gentlemen
congratulations
are you really going to give them
artillery sir
l was wondering that sir
might be difficult to get it back
give them artillery and youve made
them independent
then l cant give it to them can l
for you to say
no its not
lve got orders to obey thank god
not like that poor devil
hes riding the whirlwind
lets hope were not
excuse me friend
who do these bags belong to
to prince feisal
youre not prince feisal
no
you know him though
he is my master l am his servant
can you read
chicago courier is my paper
but my work is syndicated in america
l understood so from your letter
mr bentley
now
where can l find major lawrence
ls that what you have come for
not altogether sir no
well mr bentley you will find
major lawrence with my army
thats what l meant sir
where can l find your army
l dont know
last week they were near el ghira
ghira
yes l fear you have a long journey
can you ride a camel
lve never tried
take a mule
avoid mellaha the turks are there
ln mellaha now they move fast
they do
but not so fast as we do
you will find
myself
l am going to cairo
as you know
yes
theres work for me there
of a different kind
yes
l understand youve
been given no artillery
that is so
youre handicapped
lt restricts us to small things
lts intended to
do you know general allenby
watch out for allenby
hes a slim customer
excuse me
a clever man
slim customer lts very good
lll certainly watch out for him
youre being very sympathetic
your highness we americans were
once a colonial people
we naturally feel
sympathetic to any people
who struggle for their freedom
very gratifying
also my interests are the same
as yours you want your story told
l badly want a story to tell
ah now you are talking turkey
are you not
l will give you a guide and a letter
and before l leave here
which must be presently
l will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you
you know that we are
destroying the turkish railways
l do sir
major lawrence is in charge
of all this is he
my army is made up of tribes
the tribes are led
by the tribal leaders
your people do think very highly
of major lawrence
oh yes and the rightly
ln this country mr bentley
the man who gives victory
in battle is prized
beyond every other man
one figure l can give you
from my head
because it never leaves my head
since starting this campaign
four months ago we have lost
3 7 wounded
1 56 dead
you remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded
yeah
four times as many
thats because those too wounded
to bring away we ourselves kill
we leave no wounded for the turks
you mean
we leave no wounded for the turks
ln their eyes we are not
soldiers but rebels
rebels wounded or whole are
not protected by the geneva code
and are treated harshly
how harshly
more harshly than l hope
you can imagine
l see
our own prisoners are taken care of
until the british
can relieve us of them
according to the code
l should like you to notice that
yes sir
ls that the influence
of major lawrence
why should you suppose
lts just that l heard
in cairo that
major lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed
that is exactly so
with major lawrence
mercy is a passion
with me it is merely good manners
you may judge which motive
is the more reliable
and now perhaps
oh sure sure
thank you sir
can you manage the letter
lll do everything l have said
if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest
in my people and major lawrence
lts very simple sir
lm looking for a hero
lndeed
you do not seem a romantic man
oh no
but influential men back home believe
its time for america
to lend her weight to
the struggle against germany
and turkey
lve been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is
enjoyable
hardly that sir
but to show it in its
more adventurous aspects
you look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war
all right yes
lawrence is your man
stop
stop it
stop it
come on men
lawrence
good god god
jiminy never seen a man killed
with a sword before
why dont you take a picture
wish l had
how is it with thee lawrence
am l in this
did you take his picture
yeah
you are using up your nine lives
very quickly
charming company you keep
auda
hes a bit oldfashioned he thinks
these things will steal his virtue
he thinks youre a kind of thief
lts all right to take your picture
all right
okay
just walk
major lawrence
yes sir thats my baby
this looting has got to stop
lt is customary
lts theft and theft makes thieves
l would not say that to auda
lt is their payment colonel
payment
truly are not british soldiers paid
they dont go home when being paid
they are not free to
well theres another lot youve
seen the last of
theyll come back
he says theyll come back
will they
not this year lawrence
look lawrence how many men do
you think youll have left 200
less
well then
l said theyll come back
you badly hurt
not hurt at all
didnt you know they can only
kill me with a golden bullet
lt is for children
l have set myself to learn again
what are you learning from this
politics
youll be a democracy in this country
you gonna have a parliament
l will tell you that
when l have a country
did l answer well
you answered without
saying anything thats politics
you learn quickly
l have a good teacher
yeah
hows your hurt
fine
before l return to the fleshpots
which l shall be very glad to do
may l put two questions to you
straight
ld be interested to hear you put
a question straight
one
what in your opinion do these people
hope to gain from this war
they hope to gain their freedom
freedom
they hope to gain their freedom
theres one born every minute
theyre going to get it
lm going to give it to them
the second question
well l was going to ask
what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert
lts clean
well now
thats a very illuminating answer
may l
take one farewell picture
l gave math budad two lamps for it
one clock for two lamps
a fair bargain
fair l robbed him
trash
l must find something honorable
honorable
the year is running out brighton
l must find something honorable
now you may blow up my train
and what will you do now
now l go home
they will carry my toys
they will carry my toys too see
major lawrence will campaign
this winter
but you got what you wanted
so youre going home is that it
of course when lawrence has got
what he wants he will go home
when youve got what you want
you will go home
no l shant auda
then you are a fool
maybe but l am not a deserter
give thanks to god brighton
that when he made you a fool
he gave you a fools face
you are an impudent rascal
l must go lawrence before l
soil myself with a fools blood
like talking to a brick wall
so what will you do now
what can you do
lll go north
thats what allenby wants
allenby wanted the arab army
behind deraa
then thats where lll take it
tell allenby to hurry up or well be
in deraa before hes in jerusalem
wont we
train farraj
yeah lawrence
hide yourself my friend
detonator
all right fetch another
pardon lawrence l put
plenty of time fetch another
farraj
what happened
detonator a detonator
he cannot ride lawrence look
lf they take him alive
you know what theyll do to him
daud will be angry with you
salute him for me
what will you do now
go north
with twenty
what would
you recommend me to do
what would you recommend
he hasnt 1 1 0 so many men sir
hes lied in fact
yes and no he doesnt claim to have
done anything he hasnt done
then there is an arab north army
no sir he has lied about that
any idea why
lts his army l suppose
lts prince feisals army
do you think hes gone native harry
no
he would if he could l think
not my line of country
lt doesnt matter just curious
what matters is l believed it
the turks believe it
they are offering 20000 pounds
for him
good heavens
shouldnt say he had long to live
whatever else hes a brave man
surely surely lf hes still going north
with 50 men he doesnt lack guts
l wonder if theyd offer that much
for me
what about next year
will they still come back
l wouldnt be surprised
they think hes a kind of prophet
they do or he does
now may l speak
yes
one more failure and you will find
yourself alone
l do not include myself
l do not include the others
so say they love you
the more reason to be thrifty
with them
give them something to do
that can be done but you no
they must move mountains
walk on water
thats right thats right
who are you to know
what can be done
lf wed done what you thought could
be done wed be in yenbo now
whatever l ask them to do can
be done they know that if you dont
do you think lm just anybody
do you
my friends who will walk on water
with me
who will come with me into deraa
deraa is garrisoned
will you take 20 against 2000
lll go by myself if l have to
why
because l told the english generals
the arab revolt would be in deraa
when theyd be in jerusalem
or perhaps you are here
for the english generals
who says this
rumour
that is not an argument
oh argument
this afternoon l will take
the arab revolt into deraa
while the arabs argue
can you pass for an arab
in an arab town
yes lf one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes
lts madness
what are you looking for
some way to announce myself
be patient with him god
do you not see how they look at you
peace ali l am invisible
halt
walk on
halt
walk on
you and you
you
you have blue eyes
l say you have blue eyes
yes effendi

yes effendi
how old are you
twentyseven effendi
l think
you look older
you have had a lot of experience
lts an interesting face
l am surrounded by cattle
he wouldnt know an interesting face
from a sows belly
l have been is deraa now
for three and a half years
lf they posted me to the dark side
of the moon l could not be more
isolated
you havent the least idea
what lm talking about
no effendi
have you
no
that would be too
lucky
where did you get that
lts old effendi
no this is recent
you are a deserter
no effendi
yes you are a deserter
but from which army
not that it matters at all
a man cannot be always in uniform
your skin is very fair
beat him
to me
sleep
sleep
eat
eat
you have a body like other men
good
then sleep
better
much better you were right
rest rest can you not learn
oh lve learned all right
lm going ali
why
why
heavens
why
lve come to the end of myself
l suppose
and the end of the arab revolt
lm not the arab revolt ali
lm not even arab
a man can be whatever he wants
you said
lm sorry l thought it was true
you proved it
look ali look
thats me what colour is it
thats me
and theres nothing l can do about it
a man can do whatever he wants
you said
he can
but he cant want what he wants
this is the stuff that decides what
he wants
you may as well know
l wouldve told them anything
l wouldve told them who l am
l wouldve told them where you were
l tried to
so would any man
well any man is what l am
and lm going back to allenby to
ask him for a job
that any man can do
allenbys in jerusalem
lll make easy stages
you
oh yes easy stages
look ali l think l see
a way of being just
ordinarily
happy
can l take this
lt is not clean
no but its warm
and these
having led them here
have you no care for them
you lead them theyre yours
trust your own people
and let me go back to mine
l say dont forget those form fives
all right
mind if l join you
honoured sir
good to be back
we heard you were sir
whats doing out there
where
arabia
well yes sir

bloody wogs
yes probably
jolly good about the squash court
lays it on a bit thick doesnt he
morning
good morning sir
good to be back
lll believe you sir
no really it is
hello
morning youre to go right in
lawrence
or is it major lawrence
sir
well general l will leave you
major lawrence doubtless
has reports to make
about my people
and their weakness
and the need to keep them
in the british interest
and the french interest too
we must not forget the french
l told you sir no such treaty exists
yes general you have lied
most bravely but not convincingly
l know this treaty does exist
treaty sir
he does it better than you general
but then of course
he is almost an arab
you really dont know
then what the devils this
lts my request
for release from arabia sir
for what reason
you sure you havent heard
of the sykespicot treaty
no
l can guess
dont guess tell him
well now
mr sykes is an english civil servant
monsieur picot is
a french civil servant
mr sykes and monsieur picot met
and they agreed that after the war
france and england should
share the turkish empire
lncluding arabia
they signed an agreement
not a treaty sir
an agreement to that effect
there may be honour among thieves
but theres none in politicians
and lets have
no displays of indignation
you may not have known
but you certainly had suspicions
lf weve told lies
youve told halflies
and a man who tells lies like me
merely hides the truth
but a man who tells halflies
has forgotten where he put it
the truth is lm an ordinary man
you might have told me that dryden
and l want an ordinary job sir
thats my reason for resigning
lts personal
personal
yes sir
personal
youre a serving officer in the field
and as it happens a damned
important one are you mad
no and if you dont mind
ld rather not go mad
thats my reason too
look lm making my big push
on damascus the 1 6th of next month
and you are part of it
can you understand that youre
an important part of the big push
l dont want to be part
of your big push
what about your arab friends
l have no arab friends
l dont want arab friends
what in hell do you want lawrence
lve told you l just want
my ration of common humanity
lawrence
yes
nothing sorry l interrupted sir
thats all right
thank you mr dryden
thank you sir
why dont we
theres blood on your back
do you want a doctor
no
tell me what happened
say what goes on in there
nothing
oh come on
no really nothing at all
ls the man in trouble
l expect so we all have troubles
lifes a vale of troubles
let me know if the mans in trouble
lve got a claim in that man
what claim
lve made that boy a hero
when the wars over
he can be anything he wants
yes well at the moment
he wants to be somebody else
will you kindly allow me to pass
walk away dryden walk away
always walking away arent you
well lll tell you
lts a clash of temperament
thats going on in there
lnevitably one of thems halfmad
and the other wholly unscrupulous
l believe your name will
be a household word
when youd have to go to the
war museum to find who allenby was
youre the most extraordinary man
l ever met
leave me alone
leave me alone
thats a feeble thing to say
l know lm not ordinary
thats not what lm saying
all right lm extraordinary
what of it
not many people have
a destiny lawrence
lts a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has
are you speaking from experience
no
youre guessing then
suppose youre wrong
why suppose that
we both know lm right
yes l said yes
after all
the 1 6th
can you do it
lll give you a lot of money
artillery
l cant
they wont be coming for money
not the best of them
theyll be coming for damascus
which lm going to give them
thats all l want
all you want is someone
holding down the turkish right
but lm going to give them damascus
well get there before you do
and when weve got it well keep it
tell the politicians
to burn their paper now
fair enough
fair whats fair got to do with it
lts going to happen
l shall want quite a lot of money
all there is
not that much
the best of them
wont come for money
theyll come for me
no pictures
lts not for you its for major lawrence
he doesnt mind having his picture
taken he doesnt mind at all
well theres only one lawrence
have you met major lawrence
since hes come back
yes
changed hasnt he
no
oh ld say he had
different man ld say
what did that turkish general
do to him in deraa
he was the same man after deraa
the same man humbled
what did the english general
do to him in jerusalem

what did he say
he laughed
he told me to gather the harith here
he offered me money
did you take it
no but many did
what is this

without a price on his head
theres a price on my head too

by special train in two days time
two days
two days is what you asked for

technical units particularly
yes sir
medicals too sir
lm afraid so harry
medicals too
we here
are neither harith nor howeitat
nor any other tribe but arabs
of the arab council
acting for prince feisal
he insulted me
sherif ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the howeitat
and they have ceased to work
and this is true
they will not work because
they are given no electricity
the electricity is
in the care of the harith
lf you answer
there will be bloodshed
you speak to me of bloodshed
l ask pardon of auda abu tayi
humbly
humbly harith
yes humbly
this is a new trick
why is there no electricity
l have been to that
electrical house lawrence
there are three large machines
he means generators
so
one of them is burning
they are of an incredible size

the need is absolute
then we need english engineers
no take english engineers
and you take english government
take
fire has broken out
where
the jinsibi district
lt is not a district that matters

there is only the desert for you
what about you
no l shall stay here
and learn politics
a very low occupation
l had not thought of it
when l met you
you have tried very hard
to give us damascus
lts what l came for
and then
it would be something
yes
much
he is your friend
take your hand away
you love him
l fear him
then why do you weep
lf l fear him who love him
how must he fear himself
who hates himself
take your hand away howeitat
so you are not yet entirely politician
not yet
well these are new tricks
and l am an old dog
and allah be thanked
lll tell thee what
being an arab will be thornier
than you suppose harith
ln all my years
lve never seen anything like it
lt comes within the jurisdiction
of the arab council
under the circumstances l think
l must take over lmmediately
under any circumstances at all
you must obey your orders
no sir l will not
control yourself
now go over to the town hall
and see what they say
we did what we could
in the civic hospitals
but you forgot
the turkish military hospital
lt has 600 beds there are
about 2000 turkish wounded in it
all of whom are the responsibility
of your precious arab council
whats it like
this is outrageous
outrageous
outrageous
you filthy little wog
my friend lawrence
if l may call him that
my friend lawrence
how many men will claim the right
to use that phrase how proudly
he longs for the greenness
of his native land
he pines for the gothic cottages
of surrey is it not
already in imagination
he catches trout
and all the activities
of the english gentleman
thats me youre describing sir
not colonel lawrence
youre promoted colonel
yes what for
take the honour colonel
be a little kind
as a colonel youll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home
then thank you
well then
godspeed
theres nothing further here
for a warrior
we drive bargains old mens work
young men make wars
and the virtues of war
are the virtues of young men
courage and hope for the future
then old men make the peace
and the vices of peace
are the vices of old men
mistrust and caution
lt must be so
what l owe you is beyond evaluation
the powerhouse the telephone
exchange these l concede
the pumping plant l must retain
lf you retain it
there will be no water
l shall be glad of assistance
then you must bring down your flag
l shall not and if your men
attempt it my men will resist it
have you men
enough of that
lts a thing that
makes an ugly incident
lm sure your government
does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor
l say
lts lawrence isnt it
may l shake your hand sir
just want to be able
to say ld done it sir
havent we met before
dont think so sir
no no sir l should remember that
lt is widely known the arab council
took power in my name
they have no power lts illusory
lllusions can be very powerful
particularly
when they take this form
the world is delighted
at the picture of damascus
liberated by the arab army
led may l remind you
by a britishserving officer
ah yes but then lawrence
is a sword with two edges
we are equally glad
to be rid of him are we not
l thought l was a hard man sir
you are merely a general
l must be a king
excuse me sir
well
well
it seems were to have
a british waterworks
with an arab flag on it
do you think it was worth it
not my business
thank god lm a soldier
yes sir
so you keep saying
you l suspect
are chief architect
of this compromise
what do you think
me your highness
on the whole l wish
