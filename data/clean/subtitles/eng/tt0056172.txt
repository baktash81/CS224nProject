you re an interesting man 
there s no doubt about it 
 who told you to take aqaba

 aqaba s important 
 why is it important 
 lt s the turkish route to the canal 
 not anymore 
 they re coming through beersheba 
 l know  but we ve gone to gaza 
 so 
 so that left aqaba behind your right 
true 
and it will be further behind your
right when you go for jerusalem 
am l going for jerusalem 
yes 
very well 
aqaba behind my right 
lt threatened el  ar√Æsh and gaza 
anything else 
yes 
aqaba s linked with medina 
do you think we should shift them
out of medina now 
no  l think you should
leave them there 
you acted without orders  you know 
shouldn t officers use
their initiative at all times 
not really  lt s awfully dangerous 
yes  l know 
already 
yes 
l m promoting you major 
l don t think that s a very good idea 
l didn t ask you 
l want you to go back   
   and carry on the good work 
no  thank you  sir 
 why not 
 well  l  it s    
let me see now    
l killed two people 
l mean  two arabs 
one was a boy 
that was   
   yesterday 
l led him into a quicksand 
the other was a man 
that was   
   before aqaba  anyway 
l had to execute him with my pistol 
there was something about it
l didn t like 
 well  naturally 
 no  something else 
that s all right 
let it be a warning 
no  something else 
what  then 
l enjoyed it 
rubbish  rubbish and nerves 
you re tired 
what do you mean coming dressed
like that  amateur theatricals 
yes  entirely 
let me see that hat thing
or whatever it is 
fascinating gear they wear 
how would l look in this  harry 
 damn ridiculous  sir 
 here  you keep it 
what l m trying to say
is l don t think l m fit for it 
really  what do you think  dryden 
before he did it  sir  l d have said
it couldn t be done 
 brighton 
 l know what he thinks 
l think you should recommend
a decoration  sir 
l don t think it matters
what his motives were 
lt was a brilliant bit of soldiering 
 mr  perkins 
 sir 
let s have a drink  gentlemen 
 you ve heard about this  mr  perkins 
 yes  sir 
 what do you think about it 
 bloody marvellous  sir  well done 
 thank you  mr  perkins 
 sir 
come on  then 
you re a clever man  sir 
no  but l know a good thing
when l see one 
that s fair  surely 
lf l need a breakthrough to jerusalem 
l must concentrate  not dissipate 
 bravo 
 you know better 
l fight like clausewitz 
then you fight like saxe 
we should do very well indeed 
shouldn t we 
easy  gentlemen  please 
 give us something to drink 
 of course  sir 
l m here at the invitation
of major lawrence 
tracy 
shall we go outside 
so you hold bound the turkish
desert army 
yes 
with 1 000 arabs 
with 1 000 arabs 
1 000 arabs means 1 000 knives 
delivered anywhere  day or night 
lt means 1 000 camels 
that means 1 000 packs of high
explosives and 1 000 crack rifles 
we can cross arabia while
johnny turk is still turning round 
l ll smash his railways 
while he mends 
l ll smash them somewhere else 
ln 1 3 weeks l can have
arabia in chaos 
you are going back  then 
yes 
of course l m going back 
well  if we can see it 
so can the turk 
lf he finds he s using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits   
   he ll withdraw 
he daren t withdraw 
arabia s part of his empire 
lf he gets out now 
he ll never get back again 
 l wonder who will 
 no one will 
arabia s for the arabs now 
that s what l ve told them anyway 
that s what they think 
 that s why they re fighting 
 oh  surely 
they ve only one suspicion 
that we ll let them drive the turks
out and then move in ourselves 
l ve told them that that s false 
that we have no ambitions in arabia 
have we 
l m not a politician  thank god 
have we any ambition
in arabia  dryden 
difficult question  sir 
l want to know  sir 
if l can tell them in your name   
   that we ve no ambitions in arabia 
certainly 
2000 small arms  not enough 
l need five 
right 
money  lt ll have to be sovereigns 
they don t like paper 
 lnstructors for the lewis guns 
 right 
more money 
 how much more 
 25 000 now  a lot more later 
 dryden 
 lt can be done  sir 
a couple of armoured cars 
right 
field artillery 
right 
l ll give you every
blessed thing l can   
   because l know you ll use it 
congratulations 
thank you for your hospitality 
gentlemen 
congratulations 
are you really going to give them
artillery  sir 
l was wondering that  sir 
might be difficult to get it back 
give them artillery and you ve made
them independent 
then l can t give it to them  can l 
 for you to say 
 no  it s not 
l ve got orders to obey  thank god 
not like that poor devil 
he s riding the whirlwind 
let s hope we re not 
excuse me  friend 
who do these bags belong to 
to prince feisal 
 you re not prince feisal 
 no 
you know him though 
he is my master  l am his servant 
can you read 
chicago courier is my paper 
but my work is syndicated in america 
l understood so from your letter 
mr  bentley 
now    
 where can l find major lawrence 
 ls that what you have come for 
not altogether  sir  no 
well  mr  bentley  you will find
major lawrence with my army 
that s what l meant  sir 
where can l find your army 
l don t know 
 last week they were near el ghira 
 ghira 
yes  l fear you have a long journey 
can you ride a camel 
 l ve never tried 
 take a mule 
avoid mellaha  the turks are there 
ln mellaha now  they move fast 
they do 
but not so fast as we do 
you will find 
myself   
   l am going to cairo 
 as you know 
 yes 
there s work for me there
of a different kind 
yes 
l understand you ve
been given no artillery 
 that is so 
 you re handicapped 
lt restricts us to small things 
lt s intended to 
do you know general allenby 
watch out for allenby 
he s a slim customer 
 excuse me 
 a clever man 
slim customer  lt s very good 
l ll certainly watch out for him 
you re being very sympathetic 
your highness  we americans were
once a colonial people 
we naturally feel
sympathetic to any people   
   who struggle for their freedom 
very gratifying 
also  my interests are the same
as yours  you want your story told 
l badly want a story to tell 
ah  now you are talking turkey 
are you not 
l will give you a guide and a letter 
and before l leave here   
   which must be presently   
   l will have some facts and figures
put on paper for you 
you know that we are
destroying the turkish railways 
l do  sir 
major lawrence is in charge
of all this  is he 
my army is made up of tribes 
the tribes are led
by the tribal leaders 
your people do think very highly
of major lawrence 
oh  yes  and the rightly 
ln this country  mr  bentley   
   the man who gives victory
in battle is prized   
   beyond every other man 
one figure l can give you
from my head   
   because it never leaves my head 
since starting this campaign
four months ago  we have lost   
   3 7 wounded   
   1 56 dead 
you remark the disproportion between
our dead and wounded 
yeah 
four times as many 
that s because those too wounded
to bring away  we ourselves kill 
we leave no wounded for the turks 
 you mean    
 we leave no wounded for the turks 
ln their eyes  we are not
soldiers but rebels 
rebels  wounded or whole  are
not protected by the geneva code   
   and are treated harshly 
how harshly 
more harshly than l hope
you can imagine 
l see 
our own prisoners are taken care of
until the british   
   can relieve us of them 
according to the code 
 l should like you to notice that 
 yes  sir 
ls that the influence
of major lawrence 
why should you suppose 
lt s just that l heard
in cairo that   
   major lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed 
that is exactly so 
with major lawrence 
mercy is a passion 
with me  it is merely good manners 
you may judge which motive
is the more reliable 
 and now  perhaps    
 oh  sure  sure 
thank you  sir 
can you manage the letter   
l ll do everything l have said   
   if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest   
   in my people and major lawrence 
lt s very simple  sir 
l m looking for a hero 
lndeed 
you do not seem a romantic man 
oh  no 
but influential men back home believe
it s time for america   
   to lend her weight to
the struggle against germany 
and turkey 
l ve been sent to find material to
show our people that this war is    
 enjoyable 
 hardly that  sir 
but to show it in its
more adventurous aspects 
you look for a figure who
will draw your country towards war 
all right  yes 
lawrence is your man 
stop 
stop it 
stop it 
come on  men 
lawrence 
good god  god 
jiminy  never seen a man killed
with a sword before 
why don t you take a picture 
wish l had 
how is it with thee  lawrence 
am l in this 
did you take his picture 
yeah 
you are using up your nine lives
very quickly 
charming company you keep 
auda 
he s a bit old fashioned  he thinks
these things will steal his virtue 
he thinks you re a kind of thief 
lt s all right to take your picture 
 all right 
 okay 
just walk 
major lawrence 
yes  sir  that s my baby 
this looting has got to stop 
lt is customary 
lt s theft  and theft makes thieves 
l would not say that to auda 
 lt is their payment  colonel 
 payment 
truly  are not british soldiers paid 
 they don t go home when being paid 
 they are not free to 
well  there s another lot you ve
seen the last of 
they ll come back 
he says they ll come back 
will they 
not this year  lawrence 
look  lawrence  how many men do
you think you ll have left  200 
 less 
 well  then 
l said  they ll come back 
you badly hurt 
not hurt at all 
didn t you know  they can only
kill me with a golden bullet 
lt is for children 
l have set myself to learn again 
 what are you learning from this 
 politics 
you ll be a democracy in this country 
you gonna have a parliament 
l will tell you that
when l have a country 
did l answer well 
you answered without
saying anything  that s politics 
you learn quickly 
l have a good teacher 
yeah 
 how s your hurt 
 fine 
before l return to the fleshpots 
which l shall be very glad to do   
   may l put two questions to you 
straight 
l d be interested to hear you put
a question straight 
one 
what  in your opinion  do these people
hope to gain from this war 
they hope to gain their freedom 
freedom 
  they hope to gain their freedom   
 there s one born every minute 
 they re going to get it 
l m going to give it to them 
 the second question 
 well  l was going to ask   
   what is it that attracts you
personally to the desert 
lt s clean 
well  now   
   that s a very illuminating answer 
may l   
   take one farewell picture 
l gave math budad two lamps for it 
one clock for two lamps 
a fair bargain 
fair  l robbed him 
trash 
l must find something honorable 
honorable 
the year is running out  brighton 
l must find something honorable 
now you may blow up my train 
and what will you do now 
now l go home 
they will carry my toys 
they will carry my toys too  see 
major lawrence will campaign
this winter 
but you got what you wanted 
so you re going home  is that it 
of course  when lawrence has got
what he wants  he will go home 
when you ve got what you want 
you will go home 
no  l shan t  auda 
then you are a fool 
maybe  but l am not a deserter 
give thanks to god  brighton   
   that when he made you a fool 
he gave you a fool s face 
you are an impudent rascal 
l must go  lawrence  before l
soil myself with a fool s blood 
like talking to a brick wall 
so what will you do now 
what can you do 
l ll go north 
that s what allenby wants 
allenby wanted the arab army
behind deraa 
then that s where l ll take it 
tell allenby to hurry up  or we ll be
in deraa before he s in jerusalem 
won t we 
train  farraj 
yeah  lawrence 
hide yourself  my friend 
detonator 
all right  fetch another 
 pardon  lawrence  l put  
 plenty of time  fetch another 
farraj 
 what happened 
 detonator  a detonator 
he cannot ride  lawrence  look 
lf they take him alive 
you know what they ll do to him 
daud will be angry with you 
salute him for me 
what will you do now 
go north 
with twenty 
what would
you recommend me to do 
what would you recommend 
he hasn t 1  1 0 so many men  sir 
he s lied  in fact 
yes and no  he doesn t claim to have
done anything he hasn t done 
then there is an arab north army 
 no  sir  he has lied about that 
 any idea why 
 lt s his army  l suppose 
 lt s prince feisal s army 
do you think he s gone native  harry 
no 
he would if he could  l think 
 not my line of country 
 lt doesn t matter  just curious 
what matters is l believed it 
the turks believe it 
they are offering 20 000 pounds
for him 
good heavens 
 shouldn t say he had long to live 
 whatever else  he s a brave man  
surely  surely  lf he s still going north
with 50 men  he doesn t lack guts 
l wonder if they d offer that much
for me 
what about next year 
will they still come back 
l wouldn t be surprised 
 they think he s a kind of prophet 
 they do or he does 
 now may l speak 
 yes 
one more failure and you will find
yourself alone 
 l do not include myself 
 l do not include the others 
so say they love you 
the more reason to be thrifty
with them 
give them something to do
that can be done  but you  no 
they must move mountains 
walk on water 
that s right  that s right 
who are you to know
what can be done 
lf we d done what you thought could
be done  we d be in yenbo now 
whatever l ask them to do can
be done  they know that if you don t 
do you think l m just anybody 
do you 
my friends  who will walk on water
with me 
 who will come with me into deraa 
 deraa is garrisoned 
will you take 20 against 2000 
 l ll go by myself if l have to 
 why 
because l told the english generals   
   the arab revolt would be in deraa
when they d be in jerusalem 
or perhaps you are here   
   for the english generals 
who says this 
rumour 
that is not an argument 
oh  argument 
this afternoon l will take
the arab revolt into deraa   
   while the arabs argue 
can you pass for an arab
in an arab town 
yes  lf one of you would lend me
some dirty clothes 
lt s madness 
what are you looking for 
some way to announce myself 
be patient with him  god 
 do you not see how they look at you 
 peace  ali  l am invisible 
halt 
walk on 
 halt 
 walk on 
you and you 
you 
you have blue eyes 
 l say you have blue eyes 
 yes  effendi 
 are you circassian 
 yes  effendi 
how old are you 
twenty seven  effendi 
l think 
you look older 
you have had a lot of experience 
lt s an interesting face 
l am surrounded by cattle 
he wouldn t know an interesting face
from a sow s belly 
l have been is deraa now
for three and a half years 
lf they posted me to the dark side
of the moon  l could not be more   
   isolated 
you haven t the least idea
what l m talking about 
no  effendi 
have you 
no 
that would be too   
   lucky 
where did you get that 
 lt s old  effendi 
 no  this is recent 
 you are a deserter 
 no  effendi 
yes  you are a deserter 
but from which army 
not that it matters at all 
a man cannot be always in uniform 
your skin is very fair 
beat him 
to me 
sleep 
sleep 
eat 
eat 
you have a body  like other men 
good 
then sleep 
better 
much better  you were right 
rest  rest  can you not learn 
oh  l ve learned all right 
l m going  ali 
 why 
 why 
heavens 
why 
l ve come to the end of myself 
l suppose 
and the end of the arab revolt 
l m not the arab revolt  ali 
l m not even arab 
a man can be whatever he wants 
you said 
l m sorry  l thought it was true 
you proved it 
look  ali  look 
that s me  what colour is it 
that s me 
and there s nothing l can do about it 
a man can do whatever he wants 
you said 
he can   
   but he can t want what he wants 
this is the stuff that decides what
he wants 
you may as well know 
l would ve told them anything 
l would ve told them who l am 
l would ve told them where you were 
 l tried to 
 so would any man 
well  any man is what l am 
and l m going back to allenby to
ask him for a job   
   that any man can do 
allenby s in jerusalem 
 l ll make easy stages 
 you 
oh  yes  easy stages 
look  ali  l think l see
a way of being just   
   ordinarily   
   happy 
can l take this 
lt is not clean 
no  but it s warm 
and these   
   having led them here 
have you no care for them 
you lead them  they re yours 
trust your own people 
and let me go back to mine 
 l say  don t forget those form fives 
 all right 
mind if l join you 
honoured  sir 
 good to be back 
 we heard you were  sir 
 what s doing out there 
 where 
 arabia 
 well  yes  sir 
nothing much  wrong time of year 
what s doing here 
we re settling in 
we built a squash court 
jolly good 
well  l have to go up there 
lt s borrowed  someone pinched mine 
bloody wogs 
yes  probably 
jolly good about the squash court 
lays it on a bit thick  doesn t he 
morning 
 good morning  sir 
 good to be back 
 l ll believe you  sir 
 no  really it is 
hello 
morning  you re to go right in 
lawrence 
or is it major lawrence 
sir 
well  general  l will leave you 
major lawrence doubtless
has reports to make   
   about my people
and their weakness   
   and the need to keep them
in the british interest 
and the french interest too 
we must not forget the french 
l told you  sir  no such treaty exists 
yes  general  you have lied
most bravely  but not convincingly 
l know this treaty does exist 
treaty  sir 
he does it better than you  general 
but then  of course 
he is almost an arab 
you really don t know 
then what the devil s this 
lt s my request
for release from arabia  sir 
for what reason 
you sure you haven t heard
of the sykes picot treaty 
no 
 l can guess 
 don t guess  tell him 
well  now    
mr  sykes is an english civil servant 
monsieur picot is
a french civil servant 
mr  sykes and monsieur picot met 
and they agreed that after the war   
   france and england should
share the turkish empire 
lncluding arabia 
they signed an agreement 
not a treaty  sir 
an agreement to that effect 
there may be honour among thieves 
but there s none in politicians 
and let s have
no displays of indignation 
you may not have known 
but you certainly had suspicions 
lf we ve told lies 
you ve told half lies 
and a man who tells lies  like me 
merely hides the truth 
but a man who tells half lies
has forgotten where he put it 
the truth is l m an ordinary man 
you might have told me that  dryden 
and l want an ordinary job  sir 
that s my reason for resigning 
lt s personal 
 personal 
 yes  sir 
personal 
you re a serving officer in the field 
and as it happens  a damned
important one  are you mad 
no  and if you don t mind 
l d rather not go mad 
that s my reason too 
look  l m making my big push
on damascus the 1 6th of next month   
   and you are part of it 
can you understand that  you re
an important part of the big push 
l don t want to be part
of your big push 
what about your arab friends 
l have no arab friends 
l don t want arab friends 
what in hell do you want  lawrence 
l ve told you  l just want
my ration of common humanity 
 lawrence 
 yes 
nothing  sorry l interrupted  sir 
that s all right 
thank you  mr  dryden 
thank you  sir 
why don t we    
there s blood on your back 
 do you want a doctor 
 no 
tell me what happened 
say  what goes on in there 
 nothing 
 oh  come on 
 no  really  nothing at all 
 ls the man in trouble 
l expect so  we all have troubles 
life s a vale of troubles 
let me know if the man s in trouble 
l ve got a claim in that man 
 what claim 
 l ve made that boy a hero 
when the war s over 
he can be anything he wants 
yes  well  at the moment
he wants to be somebody else 
will you kindly allow me to pass 
walk away  dryden  walk away 
always walking away  aren t you 
well  l ll tell you 
lt s a clash of temperament
that s going on in there 
lnevitably  one of them s half mad   
   and the other  wholly unscrupulous 
l believe your name will
be a household word   
   when you d have to go to the
war museum to find who allenby was 
you re the most extraordinary man
l ever met 
leave me alone 
 leave me alone 
 that s a feeble thing to say 
 l know l m not ordinary 
 that s not what l m saying 
all right  l m extraordinary 
what of it 
not many people have
a destiny  lawrence 
lt s a terrible thing
for a man to flunk it if he has 
are you speaking from experience 
no 
you re guessing  then 
suppose you re wrong 
why suppose that 
we both know l m right 
 yes  l said  yes 
 after all  
 the 1 6th 
 can you do it 
l ll give you a lot of money 
 artillery 
 l can t 
they won t be coming for money 
not the best of them 
they ll be coming for damascus 
which l m going to give them 
that s all l want 
all you want is someone
holding down the turkish right 
but l m going to give them damascus 
we ll get there before you do 
and when we ve got it  we ll keep it 
tell the politicians
to burn their paper now 
fair enough 
fair  what s fair got to do with it 
lt s going to happen 
l shall want quite a lot of money 
all there is 
not that much 
the best of them
won t come for money 
they ll come for me 
no pictures 
lt s not for you  it s for major lawrence 
he doesn t mind having his picture
taken  he doesn t mind at all 
well  there s only one lawrence 
have you met major lawrence
since he s come back 
yes 
 changed  hasn t he

the arabs are a barbarous people 
barbarous and cruel 
who but they 
who but they 
oh  you rotten man 
here  let me take
your rotten bloody picture 
for the rotten bloody newspapers 
these were cut last night 
lawrence  in damascus 
damascus 
take them to sherif ali 
tell him 
remind him 
 ls allenby in damascus 
 near 
tell sherif ali that 
they are not ripe 
general salute 
present arms 
port arms 
lawrence is behind it  sir 
the whole town is plastered
with the arab flag 
 when 
 a day and a night  sir 
they ve been here a day and a night 
they ve occupied the town 
they ve done it 
he s set up his own headquarters
in the town hall 
what else beside the town hall 
telephone exchange 
post office  powerhouse   
   hospitals  fire station 
everything  sir 
they call themselves
the arab national council   
   and they re in the town hall 
well  they re your pigeon  harry 
what should we do about it 
get them out of it  sir  quick time 
how about that  dryden 
not unless you want
a full scale rising 
 what  then 
 when will feisal be in damascus 
by special train in two days  time 
two days 
two days is what you asked for 
l can t keep him out any longer 
 lsn t it enough 
 yes 
 ample  l should think 
 we can t just do nothing 
why not  lt s usually best 
get us something to drink  tracey 
and tracey  all troops to remain
quartered until further orders 
does that apply to technical units 
technical units particularly 
yes  sir 
medicals too  sir 
l m afraid so  harry 
medicals too 
we here   
   are neither harith nor howeitat   
   nor any other tribe  but arabs   
   of the arab council 
acting for prince feisal 
he insulted me 
sherif ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the howeitat   
   and they have ceased to work 
and this is true 
they will not work because
they are given no electricity 
the electricity is
in the care of the harith 
lf you answer 
there will be bloodshed 
you speak to me of bloodshed 
l ask pardon of auda abu tayi 
humbly 
humbly  harith 
yes  humbly 
this is a new trick 
why is there no electricity 
l have been to that
electrical house  lawrence 
there are three large machines 
he means generators 
so 
one of them is burning 
they are of an incredible size 
but helpless 
lt is so of all machines 
let them burn 
what need of telephones 
 the need is absolute 
 then we need english engineers 
no  take english engineers
and you take english government 
take  
fire has broken out 
 where 
 the jinsibi district 
 lt is not a district that matters 
 lt will spread 
then use the fire brigade 
we have tried 
but there is no force in the water 
then you must carry it 
 the ruala do not carry water 
 what else are they good for 
we will hear petitions this afternoon 
this afternoon 
 l ll take this up after the war 
 surely we should do something  sir 
 lt s an old man s sport 
 are you an old man  sir 
all l can say is  sir 
it s a heavy responsibility 
sorry  sir 
maybe it s the bulb 
no  sir 
lt s the power 
they re leaving 
that s it  then 
marvellous looking beggars 
aren t they 
leave it  lawrence  come with me 
 come where 
 back 
l know your heart 
what is it 
ls it this 
l tell you  this is nothing 
ls it the blood 
the desert has dried up more blood
than you could think of 
l pray that l may never
see the desert again 
hear me  god 
you will come 
there is only the desert for you 
what about you 
no  l shall stay here
and learn politics 
a very low occupation 
l had not thought of it
when l met you 
you have tried very hard
to give us damascus 
lt s what l came for 
and then   
   it would be something 
yes 
much 
 he is your friend 
 take your hand away 
 you love him 
 l fear him 
then why do you weep 
lf l fear him  who love him   
   how must he fear himself 
who hates himself 
take your hand away  howeitat 
so you are not yet entirely politician 
not yet 
well  these are new tricks 
and l am an old dog 
and allah be thanked 
l ll tell thee what   
   being an arab will be thornier
than you suppose  harith 
ln all my years 
l ve never seen anything like it 
lt comes within the jurisdiction
of the arab council 
under the circumstances  l think
l must take over  lmmediately 
under any circumstances at all 
you must obey your orders 
no  sir  l will not 
control yourself 
now  go over to the town hall
and see what they say 
we did what we could
in the civic hospitals 
but you forgot
the turkish military hospital 
lt has 600 beds  there are
about 2000 turkish wounded in it 
all of whom are the responsibility
of your precious arab council 
what s it like 
this is outrageous 
outrageous 
outrageous 
you filthy little wog 
my friend lawrence 
if l may call him that 
  my friend lawrence   
how many men will claim the right
to use that phrase  how proudly 
he longs for the greenness
of his native land 
he pines for the gothic cottages
of surrey  is it not 
already in imagination 
he catches trout   
   and all the activities
of the english gentleman 
that s me you re describing  sir 
not colonel lawrence 
you re promoted colonel 
yes  what for 
take the honour  colonel 
be a little kind 
as a colonel  you ll have a cabin
to yourself on the boat home 
then  thank you 
well  then   
   godspeed 
there s nothing further here
for a warrior 
we drive bargains  old men s work 
young men make wars 
and the virtues of war   
   are the virtues of young men 
courage and hope for the future 
then old men make the peace 
and the vices of peace
are the vices of old men 
mistrust and caution 
lt must be so 
what l owe you is beyond evaluation 
the powerhouse  the telephone
exchange  these l concede 
the pumping plant l must retain 
lf you retain it 
there will be no water 
 l shall be glad of assistance 
 then you must bring down your flag 
l shall not  and if your men
attempt it  my men will resist it 
 have you men 
 enough of that 
lt s a thing that
makes an ugly incident 
l m sure your government   
   does not wish to appear at the peace
conference as an aggressor 
l say 
lt s lawrence  isn t it 
may l shake your hand  sir 
just want to be able
to say l d done it  sir 
haven t we met before 
don t think so  sir 
no  no  sir  l should remember that 
lt is widely known the arab council
took power in my name 
they have no power  lt s illusory 
lllusions can be very powerful 
particularly   
   when they take this form 
the world is delighted
at the picture of damascus   
   liberated by the arab army 
led  may l remind you 
by a british serving officer 
ah  yes  but then lawrence
is a sword with two edges 
we are equally glad
to be rid of him  are we not 
l thought l was a hard man  sir 
you are merely a general 
l must be a king 
excuse me  sir 
well 
well   
   it seems we re to have
a british waterworks   
   with an arab flag on it 
do you think it was worth it 
not my business 
thank god l m a soldier 
yes  sir 
so you keep saying 
you  l suspect   
   are chief architect
of this compromise 
 what do you think 
 me  your highness 
on the whole  l wish
