let s start with just one
about a mom and two kids
and a house and a hat
that  oddly enough  was worn by a cat 
but soon enough
we will get to all that 
in the valley that stretches
from this hill to that hill 
a city is nestled 
that city is anville 
hurry up 
we ll miss the movie 
any more tutti frutti

thanks 
it s a town that s not huge 
but quite big enough
for buyers and sellers
to sell and buy stuff 
from shoes and shirts
and elongated ladders
to sailboats and gibble grated
berry juice bladders 
so our story begins at the
corner of main and montroob
in the spotless real estate office
run by hank humberfloob

here the hedges were hedged 
the weeds were all weeded

really 
and how  exactly 
was it sally s fault 
give me a minute 
i m working on it 
save it  conrad 
why today  why did you have to
pick today to destroy the house 
you know what s happening today 
i tried to tell him  mom 
 mom s throwing a very
important party   i said 
 all of her important
clients will be here  
but he went right ahead
and wrecked the house 
and let nevins get away 
now  again  i hope
you re going to ground him 
yes  sally  for a week 
but that s none of your business 
a week 
come on  two days 
i asked you to do one thing today 
conrad  keep the house clean 
do you know how frustrating it is
that you re always doing the
exact opposite of what i say 
knock  knock  knock 
someone lose a dog 
i found him next door
in my yard  again 
you are a saint 
and here i thought you were only
dating me for my good looks 
lucky us 
larry quinn is here 
hey a  sport 
call me lawrence  okay 
you rescued nevins 
thanks  lawrence 
it was my pleasure  sally 
anything for my little princess 
i don t wanna be a princess 
in a constitutional monarchy 
parliament has all the real power 
i see 
okay  that s great 
look  pal  be a sport 
why don t you go
tidy up the living room 
okay  dude 
i don t have to listen to you  larry 
conrad  do what lawrence says 
have you given some thought
about the wilhelm academy 
you mean the colonel wilhelm
military academy for troubled youth 
that s the one  joan 
i m not sure it s right for conrad 
oh  joan  joan 
joan  joan  joan 
i have so much respect for you  joan 
single mother  career woman 
raising two children on your own 
and still finding time to be the best
darned real estate agent in town 
i know how hard it is  joan 
it is hard 
i know 
and i know how hard you re trying 
this is a once in a 
lifetime proposition 
and you must act now 
the colonel wilhelm military
academy for troubled youth
is what we call in the sales
game a win win scenario 
a top flight
military school 
and it s only eight hours away 
the phone 
i heard what you said 
i m not going to
military school  larry 
look  buddy

and this is probably
really strange for you 
your neighbor s dating your mom 
but here s the thing  son

i don t like you  either 
but i m gonna marry your mom 
and if it was up to me  you d
be at military school today 
i m not going to military school 
i think you re gonna love it 
it s just like summer camp 
except with brutal forced marches
and soul crushing discipline 
and one more thing  it s lawrence 
you snot nosed son
of a wonderful woman
who i m absolutely crazy about 
gosh  i love children 
joan  i didn t see you there

bring up chairs from the basement

sales conference downtown

if you wanna make cupcakes  i can take
you to your friend ginny s house 
ginny s not my friend anymore 
last time we made cupcakes 
she wanted to be the head chef 
i m the head chef 
what about denise  then 
she talked back to me  so i ordered
her not to speak to me anymore 
and you don t like bossy 
i won t tolerate it 
right 
if you re both staying

no playing ball in
the house  no fighting 
no answering the phone 
 city morgue    
mommy  can t i have some rules 
no chewing tobacco 
thanks  mom 
you have my word 
and absolutely no one sets foot
in the living room  or else 
or else what 
you re gonna do what larry said
and send me to military school 
maybe if you d just behave  i wouldn t
have to consider military school 
i wish i could trust you 
i wish i had a different mom 
well  sometimes i wish the same thing 
good luck with your meeting 
children  would you like to
watch television with me 
we don t have to tell your mother 
taiwanese parliament 
taiwanese parliament 
you tell them  kwi chang 
no more big government 
rip his heart out 
hit me 
so they slumped in their chairs 
too glum to complain 
and to make matters worse 
it started to rain 
they sat in the house
on that cold  cold  wet day
with no fun to have
and no games to play 
they could just stare out the
window or perhaps get a nap in 
and hope that something 
anything might happen 
quit bothering the fish 
i know 
 quit bothering the fish  
spit hand 
gross 
get that away from me 
get it away 
then something went bump 
what was that 
how that bump made them jump 
i think it came from the closet 
conrad 
conrad 
come on  conrad 
you shouldn t scare people 
you should ve seen
the look on your face 
it was like you saw a monster   
a monster  where 
that could ve gone better 
  what was that 
  i don t know 
looked like a humongous cat 
 humongous  
i prefer the term  big boned  or  jolly 
  now  what are we hiding from 
that was a giant cat 
but that s impossible  isn t it 
it s entirely impossible 
you know  i like this
hiding place a lot better 
they ll never find us here 
scream and run 
and there they go 
who are you 
who  me 
why  i m the cat in the hat 
there s no doubt about that 
i m a super fun diferous
feline
who s here to make sure that you re   
meeline  key lime 
turpentine 
i got nothing 
i m not so good with the rhyming 
not really  no 
look  i m a cat that can talk 
that should be enough for you people 
i can talk 
i m a cat  yes 
where did you come from 
how do i put this 
when a mommy cat and a daddy cat
love each other very much 
they decide that   
oh  no  no  no  no 
where did you come from 
my place 
where do you think

i drove 
look  i ve been

and this is the lumpiest
couch i ever sat on 
who is this dreadfully
uncomfortable woman 
get off her 
that s our baby sitter 
what the    baby sitter 
you don t need one of those  do you 
let me get this straight 
you pay this woman to sit on babies 
that s disgusting 
i d do it for nothing 
now  let s see what the old
phunometer has to say 
 phunometer  
yeah  it measures how fun you are 
hi 
control freak  yeah 
now  you 
hi  how are you 
tap it 
listen  kid 
you can tap it with a hammer 
it ain t gonna change 
just as i suspected 
you guys are both out of whack 
you re a control freak 
and you re a rule breaker 
that ll be  700 
who s your insurance carrier 
so  what do we do 
well  there are two
treatments i d recommend 
one is a series of painful shots
injected into your
abdomen and kneecap 
and the other
involves a musical number 
me me me meow
how many shots 
 how many shots  
aren t you precious 
maestro 
i know it is wet
and the sun is not sunny
but we can have lots of
good fun that is funny
it s fun to have fun
but you got to know how
hair ball 
i know lots of good tricks and i ll   
stop this right now 
who said that 
me 
remember  the fish 
came home in a baggie  loved me
for two weeks  and then nothing 
the fish is talking 
well  sure  he can talk 
but is he saying anything 
no  not really  no 
hey  socks  can it 
this cat should not be here 
he should not be about 
he should not be here when your mother is out 
come on  kids 
you gonna listen to him 
he drinks where he pees 
there was this cat i knew
back home where i was bred
he never listened to
a single thing his mother said
he never used the litter box
he made a mess in the hall
that s why they sent him to a
vet to cut off both his ba   
ba  ba   
boy  that wasn t fun  fun  fun
he never learns
you can have fun  fun  fun
but less is more
they may ship you off to
school so rein it in a little
we can t spell  fun 
without  u  in the middle
children  this cat is
currently in violation of   
17 of your mother s rules 
city morgue 
eighteen 
olé 
you can juggle work and play
but you have to know the way
you can keep or float a wish
like the way i do this fish

and that rake  that cake
life s what you make it
so have fun  fun  fun
go insane and have some fun  fun  fun

and the purebred chaps may doubt you
getting motion sickness 
milk  big mistake 
but remember this you can t
have fun without  u    
i can t breathe 
i knew that milk would
come back to haunt me 
help  help 
 u  in the middle
bravo  cat 
huh  these children are smart enough
not to fall for
your mtv style flash
at the expense of
content and moral values 
that was wicked cool 
do it again 
i d love to  but shamu is right 
i really should be going 
no  don t go

he says you may feel free to
call him thing  a   if you like 
he will also accept super thing 
thing king  kid dynamite 
chocolate thun da

thing one says he s
thing one for a reason 
and some people

transportolator

we should share the blame 
thanks  sally 
by the way 
you re a pretty good brother 
glad you think that 
maybe we can room together
at military school 
well  here goes 
bet you thought i d gone
bet you felt a sting
bet you never thought
i d have another song to sing
but now that you ve learned your
lesson allow me to blow your mind
by reading to you the small print
of the contract that you signed
okay  section eight 
article 93  subparagraph 834 
right by the chili stain 
it reads   if conrad  a k a 
concrete  should open the crate  
and we know he will   the
contract shall be null and void 
 however 
 if sally and conrad should
learn from their mistakes 
 the contract
shall be reinstated  
and i think you two have satisfied
the legal burden of learning 
yeah 
yeah 
so there s just one last game to play 
it s called
 clean up the house  
kids  meet the dynamic industrial
renovating tractormajigger
