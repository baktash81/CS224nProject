yippee 
whoa aa   
we live down there 
cemetery 
cool 
i could get used to that 
so you didn t see the real
thing  then 
i dreamt it all 
the amulet   
the comet   
does it mean something 
i can t say 
it s a secret 
who am i gonna tell 
who s gonna believe me 
all right 
it is the comet attamon 
it s the comet of the lost souls 
it could mean the end of this curse 
what curse 
the curse of being a vampire 
it is a piece of the comet
that fell to earth 
a great magician made it
into an amulet of power 
and we lost it 
300 years ago to the sea 
yes  yes  i saw it 
my uncle von
tried to catch it   
and we ve never seen him since 
from that night to this 
our wandering has never ended 
i ll help you find it 
that must be what my dream
really means 
yes  you re to join our quest 
we ll truly be brothers now 
hide 
my parents are coming 
but we re brothers 
they don t know that 
go 
mama  papa 
rudolph 
thank the stars you re safe 
my son 
you mustn t stray so far away 
we were afraid  
i was only taking the road
less traveled 
you got lost 
my poor rudolph 
yoo hoo 
anna 
brother  darling 
you re the nervy one   
sneaking off like some daywalker 
i wish 
so  father  did you find the stone 
no  but i m sure we re on the
right path 
we still have 48 hours 
well  you see  that s  
i will not fail you 
gregory 
no  gregory 
he s my friend 
a mortal 
i m rudolph s friend 
and he gave me a bite proof guarantee 
you could be anything to my son 
victimizer  slave   
dinner  perhaps 
but you can never be his friend 
he likes vampires 
and he dreams about us 
am i in your dreams  mortal 
and he knows about the amulet 
ah   
then he s a spy 
rookery s knave 
darling  he doesn t look like
a spy 
and besides  even rudolph
couldn t make up such a story 
could you  sweetheart 
mortal or not  he s just a boy 
but if you insist on eating him 
go ahead  
i never said i would 
it s impossible 
leave  i say 
but  rudolph  
should ve never befriended you 
leave  i say 
aah 
rookery 
get back 
get back 
go 
take the family 
run 
do as i say 
stay away from my family 
do your worst 
the age of chivalry is not
yet dead  
you 
what kind of bloodsucker are you 
ow 
tony  are you all right 
look out 
come on 
aah 
oh 
wow 
hey 
what s your problem 
none of your business  pal 
it is when it s in my cemetery 
visiting hours are from dawn
till dusk 
now    get a move on 
what you did was foolish 
foolish   
but brave 
we shared a vision 
he has a sympathy for our kind 
oh  lovely 
young von found the stone   
then made his way to scotland   
plucked from the sea by a
merchant ship
just as rumor had it 
then he could still be roaming free 
there was a woman i d never
seen before   
she wore a strange coat of arms 
we must find which family
she belongs to 
trace her crest 
i can help 
no    it s too risky
yo involve a mortal 
what have we got to lose 
we ve been searching
for three centuries  
this is what comes from
contact with mortals 
disrespect 
insolence 
frederick  he does have a point 
all right 
help if you can  but do not think
to change your mind and
betray us
to our most hateful enemy 
or my wrath will be revealed 
am i clear 
i think my father likes you 
that   
was liking me 
i know he can seem like a
real monster
because he s so stern with us 
he is a monster 
but you don t know what it s like
for us vampires to be so tormented 
oh  yeah  i do 
it happens to me
every day at school 
who dares torment my friend 
flint 
flint 
wake up 
wake up 
i am
the lord of the underworld 
i am your master 
it s tony thompson 
get him 
i don t think so 
i am the fiendish friend
of tony thompson 
if you do not treat him with respect 
you ll feel my wrath 
tell anybody what you
have just witnessed 
and you will be bat bait 
what on earth is going on in here 
nothing 
cora 
nancy 
sleep well last night  girls 
carry these 
yes  master 
in three months  time 
the weather gods permitting 
mcashton s will become
scotland s calling card
to not only the golf world 
but   
playing games   
while corruption festers
beneath your feet 
typical 
what do you mean  busting in here 
much as i hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings 
you need to know 
you have an infestation of vampires 
do you know who you re talking to 
i might ask you the same thing 
obviously a madman 
i ll show him the door myself 
obviously  a madman 
now what s all this talk
about vampires 
you don t seem terribly
surprised  my lord 
well  one has heard rumors 
legends 
nonsense  of course 
but wouldn t you like it
sorted out once and for all
by a trained professional 
in fact 
by the only trained professional 
now  i will admit that my fee
is substantial 
fee 
i have to pay you a fee  for what 
for putting an end to your worries 
and face facts  my lord 
you do have worries 
has there been any biting in town 
no 
not to my knowledge 
well then 
show me a biting 
there ll be no question of fees
until i see proof 
now    leave 
they think this is still
some kind of public service 
afternoon tea    mm   
very civilized  very   
stags are deers with horns  right 
male deers 
yeah 
lots of scottish crests
have those 
lots 
yeah 
it means they descended from hunters 
so   
tony 
why so interested in crests
all of a sudden 
it s sort of   
a new hobby 
tony 
what are you really up to 
mcashton has stags on his crest  see 
can i have this

and  dad 
can i go to work with you tomorrow

will lord mcashton be there 
he lives there  buddy 
but don t let that stop you 
i won t 
tony 
well   
be proud he finally has an interest
in something normal 
enough weirdness going on
around here 
no wonder he s having nightmares 
what do you mean 
my presentation got
interrupted today
by a guy claiming the village
was infested by vampires 
you re making that up 
what guy 
i ve got no family 
no one to be with 
just me and all these dead people 
i ll drink to that 
to dead people 
and    to the living dead 
oh  come on 
you re either alive or dead 
there ain t no in between  pal 
unless you re a vampire 
vampires 
heh heh 
you must be joking 
i knew you d laugh 
it s only natural 
but we ve been hunting them
for over 400 years 
that long 
it s a family business 
you might say 
for a hunter 
you wear an awful lot of jewelry 
this thing   
the vampires
have one just like it 
but with one small difference 
theirs is designed to help them 
this is designed
to send them straight to hell 
all i need is the stone 
and the magic is complete 
heh heh heh 
now it s  
it s magic 
there is a whole other
world out there   
if you just know how to look
for it 
what s that 
there 
what is it 
ohh   
we re in luck 
come on 
wha what is this 
this wasn t here yesterday 
this  oh  yeah 
i built this

now   
it must ve gone down here 
i m going after it 
wait 
it s my graveyard 
it s my job 
i ll do it 
ahem

yeah 
whoa   
come on   
you know you want it 
aah 
oh  ha ha ha

he knows what s on the other
end of the line 
and he relishes the fight 
hey   oof

it s a trap 
gregory 
let go 
oh  yeah 
mmm

bingo

just a taste 
was it worth betraying your family 
well  you re the traitor 
forever denying the truth of us 
we are the dark gods 
but you ve turned us into cowards 
skulking around our holes
like worms 
what would you have us do 
fight back 
make these mortals  blood run cold 
and you could do it  gregory 
you re young  strong  ruthless   
and willing to risk a stake
through the heart
to prove it 
better a stake than this prison 
do you think me oblivious 
what does it matter to you
what i think 
it matters greatly 
i feel your sting 
but you are frederick the great 
you feel nothing

our ancestor  elizabeth mcashton 
the stone of attamon 
my grandfather told me the legend 
he said it was to die with me 
it could still happen 
she saw a ship   
foundered upon the rocks   
though there had been no storm   
no sign of life 
no crew  save one
who crawled ashore injured 
but he was no mortal man 
his name was von 
von sackville bagge 
a vampire 
elizabeth was taken by this von
and became one of the undead herself 
and then what 
our family staked her 
and von 
warm hearted bunch  aren t you 
you of all people should understand 
i m joking  my lord 
i would ve done the same myself 
so where is she buried

she was moved 
but no one s been down here
since mother died 
i m talking about centuries ago 
my lord 
and judging from what i see   
the tomb is just here for show 
she s in an unmarked grave
wrapped in chains
with a wooden stake through
her ribs 
the coffin purified 
why 
well  do you really
want your mom
to be buried next to a vampire 
no  no 
i loved mother 
she always smelled of gardenias 
shut up 
then they buried her in
unhallowed ground 
probably outside the
churchyard walls 
that s acres worth of land 
which is why i come equipped with
state of the art vampire locators
that you re paying so dearly for 
my lord 
the little vampire sympathizer 
yaaah

thompson s son

i ve seen them all together
slithering in the night

there are plenty of ways
to get your throat punctured 
my lord

his parents want to have us
for dinner 
tony

and i wrote you a poem 
who did this to you 
rookery 
we better find elizabeth s tomb
before he does 
it s about the power of love 
who s elizabeth 
the last holder of the stone 
the woman in my dreams 
 your face saw i in the cemetery 
filled with fright   
rudolph  look 
for the night was scary 
still  you faced the foe
undaunted 
it was there   
it wants to lead us somewhere 
it was you i wanted   
to hold me when the winds are    
behind the pillar  look 
hey 
it s a door 
a secret passage 
this could lead to elizabeth s grave 
i wish we had a better light

left this behind

mortality beckons 
gregory
