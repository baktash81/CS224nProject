   where kubla khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome 
today almost as legendary
as florida s xanadu   
   the world s largest
private pleasure ground 
here on the deserts of the gulf coast 
a private mountain   
   was commissioned and successfully built 
one hundred thousand trees 
twenty thousand tons of marble   
   are the ingredients
of xanadu s mountain 
contents of xanadu s palace 
paintings  pictures  statues 
various stones of other palaces 
a collection of everything 
so big it can never
be catalogued or appraised 
enough for 10 museums 
the loot of the world 
xanadu s livestock   
   the fowl of the air  the fish of the sea 
the beast of the field and jungle   
   two of each 
the biggest private zoo since noah 
like the pharaohs   
   xanadu s landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave 
since the pyramids   
   xanadu is the costliest monument   
   a man has built to himself 
here in xanadu last week   
   xanadu s landlord was laid to rest 
a potent figure of our century   
   america s kubla khan 
charles foster kane 
its humble beginnings 
in this ramshackle building  a dying daily 
kane s empire  in its glory   
   held dominion over 37 newspapers 
two syndicates   
   a radio network 
an empire upon an empire 
the first of grocery stores  paper mills   
   apartment buildings 
factories  forests  ocean liners 
an empire through which for 50 years   
   flowed in an unending stream   
   the wealth of the earth s
third richest gold mine 
famed in american legend
is the origin of the kane fortune 
how  to boarding housekeeper mary kane 
by a defaulting boarder  in 1868   
   was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft 
the colorado lode 
fifty seven years later 
before a congressional investigation   
    walter p  thatcher 
grand old man of wall street   
   for years chief target
of kane papers  attacks on trusts   
   recalls a journey he made as a youth 
my firm had been appointed trustee
by mrs  kane   
   for a large fortune she recently acquired 
it was her wish that i take charge
of this boy  charles foster kane 
chief  is it not  that on this occasion 
charles foster kane   
   personally attacked you after striking you
in the stomach with a sled 
i shall read to the committee
a prepared statement   
   which i have brought with me 
and then refuse to answer questions 
mr  charles foster kane 
in every essence of his social beliefs   
   and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked   
   american traditions of private property   
   initiative and opportunity
for advancement   
   is  in fact  nothing more or less
than a communist 
that same month in union square    
the words  charles foster kane    
   are a menace
to every workingman in this land 
he is today what he has always been
and always will be  a fascist 
and still another opinion    
kane urged his country s entry
into one war   
   opposed participation in another 
won the election
to one american president at least 
spoke for millions of americans 
was hated by as many more 
for 40 years appeared in kane newsprint   
   no public issue
on which kane papers took no stand 
no public man whom kane himself
did not support or denounce 
often support  then denounce 
twice married  twice divorced 
first to a president s niece   
   emily norton  who left him in 1916 
died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son 
sixteen years after his first marriage   
   two weeks after his first divorce   
   kane married susan alexander   
   singer  at the town hall
in trenton  new jersey 
for wife two 
one time opera singing susan alexander   
   kane built
chicago s municipal opera house 
cost   3 million 
conceived for susan alexander kane 
half finished before she divorced him   
   the still unfinished   
   xanadu 
cost  no man can say 
kane  molder of mass opinion
though he was   
   in all his life
was never granted elective office   
   by the voters of his country 
but kane papers were once strong indeed   
   and once the prize seemed almost his 
in 1916  as independent candidate
for governor   
   the best elements of the state
behind him   
   the white house seemingly the next
easy step in a lightning political career   
   then suddenly  less than one week
before election   
   defeat 
shameful  ignominious 
defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the u s   
   forever cancelled political chances
for charles foster kane 
then  in the first year
of the great depression   
   a kane paper closes 
for kane  in four short years  collapse 
eleven kane papers merged 
more sold  scrapped 
is that correct 
don t believe everything you hear
on the radio 
 read the inquirer 
 how were business conditions in europe 
how did i find business conditions
in europe  mr  bones 
with great difficulty 
are you glad to be back 
i m always glad to be back 
i m an american 
always been an american  anything else 
when i was a reporter 
we asked them quicker than that 
what do you think
of the chances for war in europe 
i talked with the responsible leaders
of england  france  germany and italy 
they re too intelligent
to embark on a project   
   that would mean the end of civilization 
you can take my word for it 
there will be no war 
kane helped to change the world   
   but kane s world now is history   
   and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history   
   outlived his power to make it 
alone in his never finished 
already decaying pleasure palace   
   aloof  seldom visited 
never photographed   
   an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire 
vainly attempted to sway  as he once did   
   the destinies of a nation
that had ceased to listen to him   
   ceased to trust him 
then last week  as it must to all men   
   death came to charles foster kane 
news on the march 
that s it 
stand by 
i ll tell you if we want to run it again 
 how about it  mr  rawlston 
 how do you like it  boys 
 seventy years in a man s life 
 that s a lot to try to get into a newsreel 
it s a good short 
but what it needs is an angle 
all we saw on that screen
was that charles foster kane is dead 
i know that  i read the papers 
it isn t enough to tell us what a man did   
   you ve got to tell us who he was 
wait a minute 
what were kane s last words 
do you remember  boys 
what were the last words
he said on earth 
maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed 
 maybe he didn t 
 all we saw was a big american 
how did he differ from ford 
hearst or john doe 
i tell you  a man s dying words  
what were they 
you don t read the papers 
when charles foster kane died 
he said one word 
 rosebud  
that s all he said  tough guy 
yes   rosebud   just that one word 
 but who is she 
 what was it 
here s a man
who could ve been president   
   who was as loved 
hated and talked about   
   as any man in our time 
but when he dies   
   something is on his mind called rosebud 
 what does that mean 
 a racehorse he bet on once 
 that didn t come in 
 but what was the race 
rosebud 
 thompson 
 yes 
hold this up a week  two if you must 
don t you think right after he s dead  
find out about rosebud  get in touch
with anybody who knew him   
   or knew him well 
that manager of his    
bernstein  his second wife 
she s still living 
susan alexander kane 
 she runs a nightclub in atlantic city 
 that s right 
see them all  get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him   
   whoever loved him 
whoever hated his guts 
i don t mean go through
the city directory of course 
i ll get on it right away 
good  rosebud  dead or alive 
it will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing 
miss alexander 
this is mr  thompson  miss alexander 
i want another drink  john 
right away 
will you have something  mr  thompson 
 i ll have a highball  please 
 who told you you could sit down 
i thought maybe we could have a talk

i m minding my own business

then i ve a meeting with his
general manager in new york  bernstein 
then i m coming back here 
yeah  i ll see everybody that s still alive 
goodbye 
 hey    
 john 
you just might be able to help me 
when she used to talk about mr  kane 
did she ever mention rosebud 
 rosebud  
thank you  mr  thompson  thanks 
as a matter of fact  just the other day 
when the papers were full of it   
   l asked her 
she never heard of rosebud 
the directors of the thatcher memorial
library have asked me to remind you   
   about the conditions
under which you may   
   inspect certain portions
of mr  thatcher s unpublished memoirs 
 l remember them 
 yes  jennings  i ll bring him in 
 all i want is an hour  
 under no circumstances   
   are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you  you may follow me 
that s all right  i m just looking for  
jennings 
thank you  jennings 
you will be required to leave this room
at 4 30 promptly 
you will confine yourself 
it is our understanding   
   to the chapters in mr  thatcher s
manuscript regarding mr  kane 
that s all i m interested in 
thank you 
pages 83 to 142 
come on  boys 
be careful  charles 
mrs  kane 
pull your muffler around your neck 
charles 
mrs  kane 
i think we ll have to tell him now 
yes  i ll sign those papers now 
mr  thatcher 
you people seem to forget
that i m the boy s father 
it s going to be done
exactly the way i ve told mr  thatcher 
there s nothing wrong with colorado 
i don t see why we can t raise our son   
   just  cause we came into money 
if i want to  i can go to court 
a father has a right to 
a boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind    
that property is as much my property
as anybody s   
   now that it s valuable 
and if fred graves had any idea   
   this would happen  he d have made out
the certificates in both our names 
 but they re made out to mrs  kane 
 he owed the money to both of us 
  the bank s decision in all matters   
 l don t hold with giving charles to a bank  
 stop this nonsense 
 we re a bit uneducated  
 the bank s decision
concerning his education   
    his places of residence  is to be final  
 the idea of a bank being the guardian  
 stop this nonsense  jim 
 we will assume full management
of the colorado lode    
   which i repeat  mrs  kane 
you are the sole owner 
 where do i sign  mr  thatcher 
 right here 
mary  i m asking you for the last time 
you d think i hadn t been
a good husband or father  
the sum of  50 000 a year   
   is to be paid to you
and mr  kane as long as you both live   
   and thereafter to the survivor 
 let s hope it s all for the best 
 it is 
why i can t raise my own boy
is more than i can understand 
go on  mr  thatcher 
everything else  the principal 
as well as all monies earned   
   is to be administered by the bank in trust
for your son  charles foster kane   
   until he reaches his 25th birthday 
at which time   
   he is to come into complete possession 
charles 
go on  mr  thatcher

    merry christmas

and a happy new year 
in closing   
   may i remind you your 25th birthday 
which is now approaching   
   marks your complete independence
from the firm   
   of thatcher   company 
as well as acquiring the full responsibility   
   for the world s sixth largest
private fortune 
 got that 
  the world s sixth largest private fortune  
i don t think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy 
i am therefore enclosing
for your consideration   
   a list of your holdings 
extensively cross indexed 
  dear mr  thatcher  
 it s from mr  kane 
 go on 
  sorry  i m not interested in gold mines   
    oil wells  shipping or real estate  
not interested 
 one item on your list intrigues me 
the new york inquirer 
 a little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding 
 don t sell it 
i am coming back to take charge 
 l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper 
 l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper  
 traction trust exposed  
 traction trust bleeds public white  
 traction trust smashed by inquirer  
 landlords refuse to clear slums  
 inquirer wins slum fight  
 wall street backs copper swindle  
 copper robbers indicted  
 galleons of spain off jersey coast  
is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper 
i don t know how to run a newspaper 
i try everything i can think of 
you know there s not
the slightest proof this   
    armada s off the jersey coast 
 hello  mr  bernstein 
can you prove it isn t 
mr  bernstein 
i d like you to meet mr  thatcher 
 mr  leland 
 hello 
mr  thatcher  my ex guardian 
we have no secrets from our readers 
thatcher is one of our devoted readers 
he knows what s wrong with every copy
of the inquirer since i took over  read 
 girls delightful in cuba  stop 
could send you prose poems   
    about scenery but don t feel right
spending your money  stop 
 there is no war in cuba  
signed  wheeler   any answer 
yes  dear wheeler  you provide
the prose poems  i ll provide the war 
 that s fine 
 l like it myself  send it right away 
i came to see you
about this campaign of yours 
the inquirer s campaign against
the public transit company 
do you know anything
we can use against them 
you re still the college boy  eh 
i was expelled from college  a lot
of colleges  you remember  i remember 
i think i should remind you of a fact
you have forgotten 
you re one of the largest stockholders
in the public transit company 
the trouble is  you don t realize
you re talking to two people 
as charles foster kane
who owns 82 364 shares   
   of public transit preferred  see 
i do have a general idea of my holdings 
i sympathize with you 
kane is a scoundrel   
   his paper should be closed 
a committee formed to boycott him 
if you can form such a committee 
put me down for a contribution of  1 000 
on the other hand 
i am the publisher of the inquirer 
as such it s my duty  i ll let you in
on a little secret  it is also my pleasure   
   to see that the working people of this
community aren t robbed by a pack   
   of money mad pirates  just because   
   they have no one
to look after their interests 
i ll let you in on another little secret 
mr  thatcher 
i think i m the man to do it 
you see  i have money and property 
if i don t look after the interests
of the underprivileged  somebody else will 
maybe somebody
without money or property 
that would be too bad 
i saw your financial statement today 
 oh  did you 
 tell me  honestly   
   don t you think it s rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise   
   this inquirer  that is costing you
 1 million a year 
yes  i did lose  1 million last year 
i expect to lose  1 million this year 
i expect to lose  1 million next year 
at the rate of  1 million a year   
   i ll have to close this place in 60 years 
 with respect to the said newspapers   
    the said charles foster kane   
    hereby relinquishes all control thereof   
    and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto   
    and any and all other newspaper  press
and publishing properties of any kind   
    and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto   
 which means we re bust all right 
 well  out of cash 
all right  mr  bernstein 
i ve read it  mr  thatcher 
just let me sign it and go home 
you re too old
to call me mr  thatcher  charles 
you re too old to be called anything else 
you were always too old 
 in consideration thereof 
thatcher   company agrees   
    to pay to charles foster kane 
as long as he lives   
my allowance 
 you will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large   
    measure of control 
measure of control  
and we shall seek your advice 
this depression is temporary 
there s always the chance
that you ll die richer than i will 
it s a cinch i ll die richer than i was born 
we never lost as much as we made 
yes  yes  but your methods 
you know  charles   
   you never made a single investment 
you always used money to    
to buy things 
to buy things 
my mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker 
i always gagged on that silver spoon 
you know  mr  bernstein   
   if i hadn t been very rich   
   l might have been a really great man 
don t you think you are 
i think i did pretty well
under the circumstances 
what would you like to have been 
everything you hate 
i beg your pardon  sir  what did you say 
 it s 4 30  isn t it  jennings 
 yes  ma am 
you have enjoyed a very rare privilege 
young man 
 did you find what you were looking for 
 no 
 you re not rosebud  are you 
 what 
rosebud  and your name is jennings 
isn t it 
goodbye  everybody 
thanks for the use of the hall 
who s a busy man  me 
i m chairman of the board 
i got nothing but time 
what do you want to know 
we thought maybe     if we could
find out what he meant by his last words   
    as he was dying 
 that  rosebud  
maybe some girl 
there were a lot of them in the early days 
it s hardly likely that mr  kane
could have met someone casually   
   and then 50 years later  on his deathbed  
well  you re pretty young  mr  thompson 
a fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldn t think he d remember 
you take me 
one day  back in 1896 
i was crossing over to jersey on the ferry   
   and as we pulled out 
there was another ferry pulling in   
   and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off 
a white dress she had on 
she was carrying a white parasol 
i only saw her for one second 
she didn t see me at all 
but i ll bet a month hasn t gone by since   
   that i haven t thought of that girl 
 who else have you been to see 
 well  i went down to atlantic city 
susie 
thank you 
i called her myself the day after he died 
i thought maybe somebody ought to 
 she couldn t even come to the phone 
 i ll be seeing her again in a couple of days 
about rosebud  mr  bernstein 
if you d talk about anything connected
with mr  kane that you can remember 
you were with him from the beginning 
from before the beginning  young fellow 
and now it s after the end 
have you tried to see anybody
except susie 
i haven t seen anybody else  but i ve
been through walter thatcher s journal 
 that man was the biggest fool i ever met 
 he made an awful lot of money 
well  it s no trick to make a lot of money   
   if all you want is to make a lot of money 
you take mr  kane 
it wasn t money he wanted 
thatcher never did figure him out 
sometimes even i couldn t 
you know who you ought to see 
mr  leland 
he was mr  kane s closest friend 
they went to school together 
harvard 
oh  harvard  yale  princeton 
cornell  switzerland 
he was thrown out of a lot of colleges 
mr  leland never had a nickel 
one of those families
where the father is worth  10 million   
   then one day he shoots himself 
and it turns out there s nothing but debts 
he was with mr  kane and me   
   the first day mr  kane took over
the inquirer 
take a good look at it  jedediah 
it s going to look a lot different
one of these days  come on 
there ain t no bedrooms in this joint 
that s a newspaper building 
you re getting paid  mister 
for opinions or for hauling 
 jedediah 
 after you  mr  kane 
excuse me  sir  but l    
welcome  mr  kane 
welcome to the inquirer  mr  kane 
i am herbert carter  the editor in chief 
 thank you  mr  carter  this is mr  leland  
 how do you do  mr  leland 
our new dramatic critic 
i hope i haven t made a mistake 
 it is dramatic critic  right 
 that s right 
 are they standing for me 
 you  oh  mr  kane 
standing 
 how do you do 
 how do you do 
i thought it would be a nice little gesture 
 ask them to sit down  will you  please 
 the new publisher 
 you may resume your duties  gentlemen 
 thank you 
 l didn t know your plans 
 l don t know my plans myself 
 matter of fact  i haven t got any plans 
 no 
except to get out a newspaper 
 mr  bernstein 
 yes  mr  kane 
mr  carter  this is mr  bernstein 
 mr  bernstein is my general manager 
 how do you do  mr  carter 
 mr  carter 
 how do you do 
 yes  mr  bernstein 
 stein 
 kane 
 mr  carter  is this your office 
my little private sanctum
is at your disposal 
 excuse me 
 but i don t think i understand 
mr  carter  i m going to live right here
in your office as long as i have to 
live here  yes 
 excuse me 
 but a morning newspaper  after all  
excuse me 
we re practically closed for 12 hours a day 
that s one of the things
that s going to have to be changed here 
 the news goes on for 24 hours a day 
 24 
 that s right 
 excuse me 
it s impossible    
i ve drawn that cartoon 
i m no good as a cartoonist 
you certainly aren t 
you re the dramatic critic  leland 
 you still eating 
 i m still hungry 
here s a front page story in the chronicle   
   about a mrs  harry silverstone
in brooklyn who s missing 
she s probably murdered  why isn t
there something about it in the inquirer 
we re running a newspaper   
 i m absolutely starving to death 
    not a scandal sheet 
that s all right 
mr  carter  here is a three column headline
in the chronicle 
why hasn t the inquirer
a three column headline 
the news wasn t big enough 
mr  carter  if the headline is big enough 
it makes the news big enough 
 that s right 
 the murder of mrs  harry silverstone  
there s no proof
that she was murdered  or dead 
it says she s missing 
the neighbors are getting suspicious 
it s not our function
to report the gossip of housewives 
if we were interested in that kind of thing 
we could fill the paper twice over  daily 
that s the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on 
i want you to send your best man
to see mr  silverstone 
have him tell mr  silverstone if he doesn t
produce his wife  mrs  silverstone   
   the inquirer will have him arrested 
tell mr  silverstone
he s a detective from    
 central office 
 the central office 
if mr  silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your man s badge   
   your man is to get indignant
and call mr  silverstone an anarchist 
loudly  so the neighbors can hear 
you ready for dinner  jedediah 
i can t see that the function
of a respectable newspaper  
thank you so much  mr  carter  goodbye 
goodbye

four times tonight  that s all 
i ve changed the front page a little 
mr  bernstein  that s not enough 
there s something i ve got to get into
this paper besides pictures and print 
i ve got to make the new york inquirer
as important to new york   
   as the gas in that light 
what are you going to do  charlie 
my declaration of principles 
don t smile  jedediah 
i ve got it all written out here 
you don t want to make any promises
you don t want to keep 
these ll be kept 
 i ll provide the people of this city   
    with a daily paper
that will tell all the news honestly 
  l will also provide   
 that s two sentences starting with  l  
people will know who s responsible   
   and they ll get the truth in the inquirer 
quickly  simply and entertainingly 
no special interests will be allowed
to interfere with that truth 
 l will also provide them with a fighting
and tireless champion of their rights   
    as citizens and as human beings  
signed 
 charles foster kane  
 can i have that  charlie 
 i m going to print it 
solly 
yes  mr  kane 
i want you to run this editorial
in a box on the front page 
this morning s front page 
that s right  solly 
that means we ll have to remake again 
 yes 
 go down and tell them 
all right 
when you re through with that 
i d like to have it back 
i d like to keep that particular
piece of paper myself 
i have a hunch it might turn out
to be something pretty important 
 a document   
 sure 
   like the declaration of independence
and the constitution   
   and my first report card at school 
i know you re tired  gentlemen 
but i brought you here for a reason 
 this little pilgrimage will do us good 
 the chronicle s a good newspaper 
chronicle s a good idea for a newspaper 
notice the circulation 
495 000 
but look who s working for the chronicle 
 with them  it s no trick to get circulation 
 you re right 
you know how long it took the chronicle
to get that staff together 
 twenty years 
 twenty years 
six years ago  i looked at a picture
of the world s greatest newspaper men 
i felt like a kid in front of a candy store 
tonight  six years later 
i got my candy  all of it 
welcome  gentlemen  to the inquirer 
make an extra copy of that picture
and mail it to the chronicle 
it ll make you all happy to learn
that our circulation this morning   
   was the greatest in new york  684 000 
684 132 
right 
i hope you ll forgive my rudeness
in taking leave of you 
i m going abroad next week for a vacation 
i ve promised my doctor for sometime
that i would leave when i could 
i now realize i can t 
say  mr  kane 
as long as you re promising   
   there s a lot of pictures and statues
in europe you ain t bought yet 
you can t blame me  mr  bernstein 
they ve been making statues
for 2 000 years 
and i ve only been buying for five 
 promise me  mr  kane 
 l promise  mr  bernstein 
 thank you 
 mr  bernstein 
you don t expect me to keep
any of those promises  do you 
and now  gentlemen 
your complete attention  if you please 
are we going to declare war on spain 
oh  mama  here they come 
shoot me while i m happy 
i said   are we going to declare
war on spain  or are we not  
the inquirer already has 
you long faced  overdressed anarchist 
i m not overdressed 
you are  too 
mr  bernstein  look at his necktie 
let s have the song about charlie 
 is there a song about charlie 
 is there a song about you  mr  kane 
you buy a bag of peanuts in this town 
you get a song written about you 
i ve seen that fellow  he s good 
good evening  mr  kane 
 there is a man  a certain man
 and for the poor you may be sure
that he ll do all he can
 who is this one  this favorite son
 just by his action
has the traction magnates on the run
 who loves to smoke  enjoys a joke
 who wouldn t get a bit upset
if he were really broke
 with wealth and fame he s still the same
 i ll bet you  5 you re not alive
if you don t know his name
 what is his name 
 it s charlie kane  it s mister kane 
 he doesn t like that mister
he likes good old charlie kane 
 isn t it wonderful  such a party 
 yes 
what s the matter 
 who says a miss was made to kiss
 and when he meets one
always tries to do exactly this
 who buys the food  who buys the drinks
 who thinks that dough was made
to spend and acts the way he thinks
 now is it  joe  no  no  no 
bernstein  these men
who are now with the inquirer   
   who were with the chronicle
until yesterday  
oh  mama  please 
 give me that 
 what  the blonde 
 no  the brunette 
 where did you learn that  charlie 
bernstein  these men
who were with the chronicle   
   weren t they just as devoted
to the chronicle policy   
   as they are now to our policies 
sure  they re just like anybody else 
they got work to do  they do it 
only they happen to be
the best men in the business 
do we stand for the same things
the chronicle stands for 
certainly not 
listen  mr  kane  he ll have them changed
to his kind of newspapermen in a week 
there s always a chance  of course 
that they ll change mr  kane 
without his knowing it 
mr  leland  i got a cable from mr  kane 
 l got a cable here from mr  kane 
 what 
 from paris  france 
 what 
 from paris  france 
 come on in 
 who by his action
has the traction magnates on the run 
it s a good thing he promised
not to send back any more statues 
look  he wants to buy
the world s biggest diamond 
why didn t you go to europe with him 
he wanted you to 
i wanted charlie to have fun 
with me along    
bernstein  am i a stuffed shirt 
am i a horse faced hypocrite 
am i a new england schoolmarm 
yes 
if you thought i d answer you different
from what mr  kane tells you  i wouldn t 
 world s biggest diamond  
i didn t know charlie
was collecting diamonds 
he ain t 
he s collecting somebody
that s collecting diamonds 
anyway  he ain t only collecting statues 
 welcome home  mr  kane   
    from 467 employees
of the new york inquirer  
here he comes 
welcome  mr  kane 
 l know i ve a moustache 
 it looks awful 
have we got a society editor 
 right here  mr  kane 
 miss townsend is the society editor 
miss townsend 
this is mr  charles foster kane 
miss townsend  i ve been away so long 
i don t know your routine 
i got a little social announcement 
i wish you wouldn t treat this
any differently than you would any other   
   social announcement 
mr  kane  on behalf of all the employees
of the inquirer  
mr  bernstein 
thank you very much  everybody  l    
i m sorry  i can t accept it now 
goodbye 
say  he was in an awful hurry 
hey  everybody  look out here 
let s go to the window 
 mr  leland  mr  bernstein 
 yes  ms  townsend 
this announcement 
 mr  and mrs  thomas monroe norton   
    announce the engagement
of their daughter  emily monroe norton   
    to mr  charles foster kane  
come on 
emily monroe norton  she s the niece
of the president of the united states 
president s niece 
before he s through 
she ll be a president s wife 
the way things turned out 
i don t need to tell you 
miss emily norton was no rosebud 
it didn t end very well  did it 
it ended 
then there was susie  that ended  too 
you know  mr  thompson  i was thinking   
   this rosebud
you re trying to find out about    
yes 
maybe that was something he lost 
mr  kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had 
you ought to see jed leland 
of course  he and mr  kane
didn t exactly see eye to eye 
you take the spanish american war 
i guess mr  leland was right 
that was mr  kane s war 
we didn t really have anything
to fight about 
do you think if it hadn t been for that war
of mr  kane s   
   we d have the panama canal 
i wish i knew where mr  leland was 
a lot of the time now
they don t tell me these things 
maybe even he s dead 
in case you d like to know   
   he s at the huntington memorial hospital
on 180th street 
you don t say  i had  
nothing particular the matter with him 
they tell me  just    
just old age 
it s the only disease that you don t
look forward to being cured of 
i can remember absolutely everything 
young man 
that s my curse 
that s one of the greatest curses
ever inflicted on the human race  memory 
i was his oldest friend  and as far as
i was concerned  he behaved like a swine 
not that charlie was ever brutal 
he just did brutal things 
maybe i wasn t his friend 
but if i wasn t  he never had one 
maybe i was what you nowadays
call a stooge 
you were about to say something
about rosebud 
do you happen to have a good cigar 
i ve got a young physician here
who thinks i m going to give up smoking 
no  i m afraid i haven t  sorry 
i changed the subject  didn t l 
what a disagreeable old man
i have become 
you re a reporter and you want to know
what i think about charlie kane 
i suppose he had some private sort
of greatness 
but he kept it to himself 
he never gave himself away 
he never gave anything away 
he just left you a tip 
he had a generous mind 
i don t suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions 
but he never believed in anything
except charlie kane 
he never had a conviction
except charlie kane in his life 
i suppose he died without one 
that must have been pretty unpleasant 
of course  a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death 
but we do know what we re leaving 
we do believe in something 
are you absolutely sure
you haven t got a cigar 
 sorry  mr  leland 
 never mind 
 what do you know about rosebud 
  rosebud  
his dying words   rosebud  
i saw that in the inquirer 
i never believed anything
i saw in the inquirer 
anything else 
i can tell you about emily 
i went to dancing school with emily 
i was very graceful 
 we were talking about the first mrs  kane 
 what was she like 
she was like all the girls i knew
in dancing school 
very nice girl  emily was a little nicer 
after the first couple of months   
   she and charlie didn t see much
of each other except at breakfast 
it was a marriage
just like any other marriage 
 you re beautiful 
 l can t be 
yes  you are  you re very beautiful 
i ve never been to six parties
in one night before 
 i ve never been up this late 
 it s a matter of habit 
 what will the servants think 
 that we enjoyed ourselves 
why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper 
you never should ve married a
newspaperman  they re worse than sailors 
i absolutely adore you 
charles  even newspapermen
have to sleep 
i ll call mr  bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon 
what time is it 
i don t know  it s late 
it s early 
charles    
do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night   
   when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes 
what do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night 
my dear  your only correspondent
is the inquirer 
sometimes i think i d prefer a rival
of flesh and blood 
i don t spend that much time
on the newspaper 
it isn t just the time 
it s what you print  attacking the president 
 you mean uncle john 
 l mean the president of the united states 
he s still uncle john
and a well meaning fathead   
   who s letting a pack of high pressure
crooks run his administration 
 this whole oil scandal  
 he happens to be the president  not you 
that s a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days 
your mr  bernstein sent junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday 
i simply can t have it in the nursery 
mr  bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then 
does he have to 
yes 
 really  charles  people will think  
 what i tell them to think 
wasn t he ever in love with her 
he married for love 
love 
that is why he did everything 
that s why he went into politics 
it seems we weren t enough 
he wanted all the voters to love him  too 
all he wanted out of life was love 
that s charlie s story  how he lost it 
you see  he just didn t have any to give 
he loved charlie kane  of course 
very dearly 
and his mother 
i guess he always loved her 
 how about his second wife 
 susan alexander 
you know what charlie called her 
the day after he d met her 
he told me about her 
he said she was
 a cross section of the american public  
i guess he couldn t help it 
she must have had something for him 
that first night  according to charlie   
   all she had was a toothache 
what are you laughing at  young lady 
 what s the matter with you 
 toothache 
 what 
 toothache 
toothache 
you mean you ve got a toothache 
 what s funny about that 
 you re funny  mister 
 you ve got dirt on your face 
 not dirt  it s mud 
do you want some hot water 
i live right here 
what s that  young lady 
i said  if you wanted some hot water   
   l could get you some   hot water 
all right  thank you very much 
do i look any better now 
 this medicine doesn t do a bit of good 
 what you need is to get your mind off it 
excuse me  but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open   
    when i have a gentleman caller 
 all right 
you have got a toothache  haven t you 
 l surely have 
 why don t you try laughing at me again 
 what 
 i m still pretty funny 
i know  but you don t want me
to laugh at you 
i don t want your tooth to hurt  either 
look at me 
see that 
what are you doing 
i m wiggling both my ears
at the same time 
that s it  smile 
it took me two solid years at the best
boys  school in the world to learn that 
the fellow who taught me
is now president of venezuela 
that s it 
 is it a giraffe 
 no  not a giraffe 
 l bet it is 
 what 
well  then it s an elephant 
 it s supposed to be a rooster 
 a rooster 
you know an awful lot of tricks 
are you a professional magician 
 no  i m not a magician 
 l was just joking 
you really don t know who i am 
you told me your name  mr  kane 
but i m awfully ignorant 
i guess you caught on to that 
i bet i ve heard your name a million times 
you really like me  though 
even though you don t know who i am 
i surely do  you ve been wonderful 
without you i don t know
what i would have done 
i had a toothache 
and i don t know many people 
i know too many people 
i guess we re both lonely 
want to know what i was going to do
before i ruined my best sunday clothes 
i bet they re not your best sunday clothes 
you probably have more 
i was just joking 
i was on my way
to the western manhattan warehouse   
   in search of my youth 
you see  my mother died a long time ago 
her things were put in storage out west 
there wasn t any other place to put them 
i thought i d send for them now 
tonight i was going to take a look at them 
a sort of sentimental journey 
i run a couple of newspapers 
what do you do 
me 
 how old did you say you were 
 l didn t say 
if you had  i wouldn t have asked you 
 how old 
 pretty old 
 how old 
 twenty two in august 
that s a ripe old age  what do you do 
i work at seligman s 
i m in charge of the sheet music 
 is that what you want to do 
 no  i wanted to be a singer  i guess 
 that is  i didn t  my mother did for me 
 what happened to the singing 
mother always thought  she always talked
about grand opera for me 
imagine 
but my voice isn t that kind 
it s just  you know what mothers are like 
yes 
 have you got a piano 
 a piano 
yes  there s one in the parlor 
 would you sing for me 
 you wouldn t want to hear me sing 
yes  i would 
don t tell me
your toothache is bothering you 
no  that s all gone 
all right 
let s go to the parlor 
 yes  lindor shall be mine
 l have sworn it
 for weal or woe
 yes  lindor
 lo giurai
 la vinceró 
there is only one man
who can rid the politics   
   of this state of the evil domination
of boss jim gettys 
i am speaking of charles foster kane 
the fighting liberal   
   the friend of the workingman 
the next governor of this state   
   who entered upon this campaign    
   with one purpose only 
to point out
and make public the dishonesty   
   the downright villainy
of boss jim w  gettys  political machine   
   now in complete control
of the government of this state 
i made no campaign promises   
   because  until a few weeks ago 
i had no hope of being elected 
now  however  l have something more
than a hope 
jim gettys has something less
than a chance 
every straw vote   
   every independent poll shows
that l will be elected 
very well 
now l can afford to make some promises 
the workingman and the slum child   
   know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests 
the decent  ordinary citizens know
that i ll do everything in my power   
   to protect the underprivileged 
the underpaid  and the underfed 
 mother  is pop governor yet 
 not yet  junior 
i d make my promises now   
   if i weren t too busy
arranging to keep them 
but here s one promise i ll make   
   and boss jim gettys knows i ll keep it 
my first official act
as governor of this state   
   will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment   
   prosecution and conviction
of boss jim w  gettys 
if the election were held today 
you d be in by 100 000 votes 
 gettys isn t even pretending 
 pop 
 hello  son 
 he isn t just scared  he s sick 
it s beginning to dawn on jim gettys
i mean what i say 
 did you like your old man s speech 
 l could hear every word 
 hello  emily 
 hold it 
 great speech  mr  kane 
 wonderful 
will you get us a taxi 
i m sending junior home
in the car with oliver 
good night  father 
goodbye  son 
why did you send junior home in the car 
what are you doing in a taxi 
there s a call i want you to make with me 
 it can wait 
 no  it can t 
what s this all about  emily 
it may not be about anything at all 
i intend to find out 
 where are you going 
 i m going to  185 west 74th street  
if you wish  you may come with me 
i ll come with you 
i had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama  emily 
come right in  mr  kane 
charlie 
he forced me to send your wife that letter 
i didn t want to 
he s been saying the most terrible    
mrs  kane 
i don t suppose
anybody would introduce us 
i m jim gettys 
yes 
i made miss alexander send you the note 
mrs  kane 
she didn t want to at first  but she did it 
charlie  the things he said to me    
he threatened to  
i won t wait until i m elected 
to start with  i think i ll break your neck 
maybe you can do it  and maybe you can t 
your breaking this man s neck
would scarcely explain this note 
 serious consequences for mr  kane 
for yourself and for your son  
 he wanted to get her to come here  
 what does this note mean 
i m susan alexander 
i know what you re thinking  
 what does this note mean  ms  alexander 
 she don t know 
she sent it because i told her
it wouldn t be smart not to 
 emily  this gentleman  
 i m not a gentleman 
your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one 
i don t even know what a gentleman is 
you see  my idea of a gentleman    
if i owned a paper and didn t like
the way somebody was doing things   
   some politician 
i d fight him with all i had 
i wouldn t show him in a convict suit   
   so his family could see his picture
in the paper 
 you re a cheap  crooked grafter  
 we re talking now about what you are 
i m fighting for my life 
not just my political life 
 he said unless you  
 that s what i said 
here s the chance i m willing to give him 
it s more of a chance than he d give me 
unless he decides by tomorrow that
he s so sick he has to go away for a year   
   monday morning  all papers in the state 
except his  will carry the story i ll give 
what story 
 the story about him and ms  alexander 
 there isn t any story 
shut up 
we ve got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines 
do you want me to give you the evidence 
i d rather he withdrew
without having the story published 
not that i care about him 
but i d be better off that way 
so would you  mrs  kane 
what about me 
he said my name would be dragged
through the mud  that everywhere i went  
there seems to be only one decision
you can make  charles 
i d say that it d been made for you 
you can t tell me the voters of this state  
i m not interested in the voters
of this state right now 
i am interested in our son 
 charlie  if they publish this story  
 they won t 
good night  mr  gettys 
are you coming  charles 
no 
i m staying here 
i can fight this all alone 
if you don t listen to reason 
it may be too late 
too late  for what 
for you and this public thief   
   to take the love of the people
away from me 
you got other things to think about 
your little boy 
you don t want him to read about you
in the papers 
there s only one person in the world
to decide what i ll do  and that s me 
you decided what you were going to do 
charles  some time ago 
you re making a bigger fool of yourself
than i thought 
 i ve got nothing to say to you 
 you re licked  
get out  if you want to see me 
have the warden write me a letter 
if it was anybody else  i d say what s going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you 
only you re going to need
more than one lesson 
 and you ll get more than one lesson 
 don t worry about me  gettys 
don t worry about me 
i m charles foster kane 
i m no cheap  crooked politician
trying to save himself   
   from the consequences of his crimes 
gettys  i m gonna send you to sing sing 
sing sing  gettys 
 have you a car  mrs  kane 
 yes  thank you 
 good night 
 good night 
paper  read all about it  extra  extra 
 paper 
 no  thanks 
with a million majority
already against him   
   and the church counties
still to be heard from   
   i m afraid we got no choice 
this one 
that one 
good night again 
 is there anything i can  
 no  thanks  mr  bernstein 
you better go home and get some sleep 
you  too 
good night  mr  kane 
 hello  jedediah 
 i m drunk 
if you ve got drunk to talk to me about   
   ms  alexander  don t bother 
i m not interested 
i ve set back the sacred cause of reform 
is that it 
all right 
if that s the way they want it 
the people have made their choice 
it s obvious the people prefer
jim gettys to me 
you talk about the people
as though you owned them 
as though they belong to you  goodness 
as long as i can remember  you ve talked
about giving the people their rights   
   as if you could make them
a present of liberty   
   as a reward for services rendered 
 jed 
 you remember the workingman 
i ll get drunk  too  jedediah   
   if it ll do any good 
it won t do any good 
besides you never get drunk 
you used to write an awful lot
about the workingman  
go on home 
he s turning into something called
 organized labor  
you won t like that one little bit
when you find out   
   it means your workingman expects
something as his right  and not your gift 
when your precious underprivileged
really get together    
oh  boy    
that ll add up to something
bigger than your privilege   
   then i don t know what you ll do 
sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys 
i wouldn t worry about it too much 
there ll probably be a few of them there
to tell me when i do something wrong 
you may not always be so lucky 
you re not very drunk 
drunk  what do you care 
you don t care about anything except you 
you persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back 
only you want love on your own terms 
it s something to be played your way 
according to your rules 
 let me work on the chicago paper 
 what 
you said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic  crimitism   criticism 
i am drunk 
i want to go to chicago 
you re too valuable here 
 there s nothing left for me to do  
 all right  you can go to chicago 
thank you 
i guess i d better try to get drunk anyway 
i warn you  jedediah 
you won t like chicago 
the wind comes off the lake  and they ve
probably never heard of lobster newburg 
will saturday after next be all right 
 anytime you say 
 thank you 
a toast to love on my terms 
those are the only terms anybody knows 
his own 
mr  kane  i m from the inquirer 
 what s that  young man 
 are you through with politics 
am i through with politics 
i would say vice versa 
we re going to be an opera star 
are you singing at the metropolitan 
we certainly are 
charlie said if i didn t 
he d build me an opera house 
that won t be necessary 
no  no  no 
places  please 
mr  leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle 
 and we ve covered it from the news end 
 and the social 
how about the music notice 
yes  it s already made up 
mr  mowan wrote a swell review 
 enthusiastic 
 yes  sir 
mr  kane  this is a surprise 
we ve got two spreads of pictures 
the music notice on the front page 
but there s still one notice to come 
the dramatic 
the dramatic notice 
 mr  bernstein  that s mr  leland  isn t it 
 yes  we re waiting for it 
 where is he 
 right in there  mr  kane 
mr  kane 
mr  leland and mr  kane   
   haven t spoken together for years 
 you don t suppose  
 there s nothing to suppose 
excuse me 
close the door 
he ain t been drinking before 
never  we would have heard 
what does it say there 
the notice  what s he written 
 miss susan alexander  a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur   
    last night opened
the new chicago opera house   
    in a performance of     
i still can t pronounce that name 
 her singing  happily 
is no concern of this department 
 of her acting 
it is absolutely impossible to     
go on 
that s all there is 
of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except   
   that  in the opinion of this reviewer 
it represents a new low 
 in the opinion of this reviewer 
 l didn t see that 
it isn t here  mr  bernstein  i m dictating it 
 mr  kane  l  
 get me a typewriter 
i m going to finish mr  leland s notice 
hello  bernstein 
 hello 
 hello  mr  leland 
where s my notice  bernstein 
i ve got to finish my notice 
 mr  kane is finishing it for you 
 charlie 
charlie out there 
i guess he s fixing it up 
i knew i d never get that through 
mr  kane s finishing your review
just the way you started it 
he s writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be 
i guess that ll show you 
hello  jedediah 
hello  charlie 
i didn t know we were speaking 
sure we re speaking  jedediah 
you re fired 
everybody knows that story  mr  leland 
but why did he do it 
 how could a man write a notice  
 you just don t know charlie 
he thought that by finishing that notice
he d show me he was an honest man 
he was always trying to prove something 
that whole thing about susie
being an opera singer 
that was trying to prove something 
you know what the headline was
the day before the election 
 candidate kane found
in love nest with  singer   
he was going to take
the quotes off the singer 
hey  nurse 
five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the south 
what s it called  shangri la  ei dorado 
sloppy joe s  what s the name 
all right  xanadu  i knew it all the time 
you caught on  didn t you 
i m not that hard to see through 
well  i never even answered his letter 
maybe i should have 
i guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years 
he hadn t finished it when she left him 
he never finished it 
he never finished anything
except my notice 
 of course  he built the joint for her 
 that must have been love 
i don t know 
he was disappointed in the world
so he built his own  an absolute monarchy 
it was something bigger
than an opera house anyway 
 nurse 
 yes  mr  leland 
i m coming 
 there s one thing you can do for me 
 sure 
stop at the cigar store on your way out 
and get me a couple of good cigars 
 be glad to 
 thank you 
one is enough 
when i was a young man  there was
an impression that nurses were pretty 
well  it was no truer then than it is today 
 i ll take your arm 
 all right 
 you won t forget about those cigars 
 l won t 
have them wrapped like toothpaste 
or they ll stop them at the desk 
you know that young doctor
i was telling you about  well   
   he s got an idea
he wants to keep me alive 
i d rather you d just talk 
anything that comes into your mind   
   about yourself and mr  kane 
you don t want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and charlie kane 
you know  maybe i shouldn t have sung
for charlie that first time i met him 
but i did an awful lot of singing after that 
i sang for teachers at  100 an hour 
 the teachers got that  i didn t 
 what did you get 
i didn t get a thing  except music lessons 
that s all there was in it 
he married you  didn t he 
he didn t mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and   
   until it got in the papers about us   
   and he lost the election 
and that norton woman divorced him 
he was really interested in my voice 
why did he build that opera house 
i didn t want it  i didn t want a thing 
it was his idea 
everything was his idea   
   except my leaving him 
 don t forget 
don t get nervous 
please  let s come back 
look at me  mrs  kane  darling 
 get the voice out of the throat
place the tone right in the mask
 diaphragm 
you re out of pitch 
some people can sing  some can t 
impossible 
it s not your job to give your opinion
of mrs  kane s talents 
you re supposed to train her voice 
signor matiste  nothing more 
please continue with the lesson 
 but  mr  kane 
 please 
i ll be the laughingstock
of the musical world  people will think  
you re concerned what people will think 
perhaps i can enlighten you a bit 
i m an authority on what people will think 
the newspapers for example 
i run several newspapers
between here and san francisco 
it s all right  darling 
signor matiste is going to listen to reason 
 how can i persuade you  
 you can t 
it s all right  darling  go ahead 
i thought you d see it my way 
no  no  no 
 ah  cruel
 tu m as trop entendue
 les dieux m en sont témoins
 ces dieux qui dans mon flanc
 ont allumé
 le feu fatal
 a tout mon sang
 dites moi comment j expie
 ce péché si fort
 toujours remplie
 je ne peux pas résister encore
 oh dieux  arrachez moi
 ces feux fatals 
i think it s dreadful 
 allument ma mort
 voilà mon coeur
 voilà mon coeur
 c est là que ta main doit frapper
 voilà mon coeur
 frappe
 prête moi ton épée
 frappe 
stop telling me he s your friend 
a friend don t write that kind of review 
all these other papers panning me 
i could expect that 
but for the inquirer to run a thing like that 
spoiling my whole debut 
come in 
i ll get it 
friend  not the kind of friends i know   
   but i m not high class like you 
and i never went to any swell schools 
that ll be enough  susan 
from mr  leland  sir 
he wanted me to make sure
you got this personally 
is that something from him 
charlie 
as for you 
you ought to have your head examined 
sending him a letter telling him he s fired   
   with a  25 000 check in it 
what kind of firing do you call that 
you did send him a check for  25 000 
didn t you 
yes 
i sent him a check for  25 000 
what s that 
declaration of principles 
what 
what is it 
an antique 
you re awful funny  aren t you 
i ll tell you one thing you re not going
to be funny about  and that s my singing 
i m through 
i never wanted to do it in the first place 
you ll continue with your singing  susan 
i don t propose
to have myself made ridiculous 
you don t propose
to have yourself made ridiculous 
what about me 
i m the one that has to sing 
i m the one that gets the raspberries 
why don t you leave me alone 
my reasons satisfy me  susan 
you seem unable to understand them 
i will not tell them to you again 
you ll continue with your singing 
get dr  corey 
susan 
she ll be perfectly all right
in a day or two  mr  kane 
i can t imagine how mrs  kane
came to make such a foolish mistake 
the sedative dr  wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle 
the strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her 
yes  i m sure that was it 
no objections to my staying
with her are there 
no  not at all 
i d like the nurse to be here  too 
good night  mr  kane 
charlie 
i couldn t make you see how i felt  charlie 
but i couldn t go through
with the singing again 
you don t know what it means
to know that people    
that the whole audience doesn t want you 
that s when you got to fight them 
all right 
you won t have to fight them anymore 
it s their loss 
what are you doing 
jigsaw puzzles 
charlie  what time is it 
11 30 
in new york 
i said what time is it in new york 
  11  30 
  night 
the bulldog s just gone to press 
well  hurray for the bulldog 
gee  11 30  shows are just getting up 
people are going to nightclubs
and restaurants 
of course  we re different
because we live in a palace 
you always said you wanted
to live in a palace 
a person could go crazy in this dump 
nobody to talk to 
nobody to have any fun with 
49 000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues 
i m lonesome 
until yesterday  we ve had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time 
i think if you look in the west wing   
   you ll probably find a dozen vacationists
still in residence 
you make a joke out of everything 
charlie  i want to go to new york 
i m tired of being a hostess 
i want to have fun  please  charlie 
charlie  please 
our home is here  susan 
i don t care to visit new york 
what are you doing 
one thing i can never understand 
how do you know
you haven t done it before 
it makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues 
you may be right 
i sometimes wonder   
   but you get into the habit 
it s not a habit  i do it because i like it 
i thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow 
invite everybody to spend the night
at the everglades 
invite everybody  order everybody 
you mean  and make them sleep in tents 
who wants to sleep in tents
when they ve got their own room   
   with a bath  where they know
where everything is 
i thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow 
you never give me anything
i really care about 
 it can t be love
 for there is no true love
 l know i ve played at the game
 like a moth in a blue flame
 lost in the end  just the same
 all these years
 my heart s been floating around
in a puddle of tears
 l wonder what it is 
sure  you give me things 
but that don t mean anything to you 
you re in a tent  darling 
you re not at home 
i can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice 
what s the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone  100 000   
   for a statue you ll keep crated up
and never look at 
it s just money  it doesn t mean anything 
you never really gave me anything
that you care about 
i want you to stop this 
i m not going to stop it 
you never gave me anything in your life 
you just tried to buy me
into giving you something 
 it can t be love 
whatever i do  i do because i love you 
you don t love me 
you want me to love you 
sure   i m charles foster kane 
 whatever you want 
just name it and it s yours 
 but you gotta love me  
don t tell me you re sorry 
i m not sorry 
mr  kane 
mrs  kane would like to see you  sir 
marie has been packing for her
since morning 
tell arnold i m ready  marie 
tell him he can get the bags 
yes  madame 
have you gone completely crazy 
don t you know that our guests 
that everyone will know about this 
packed your bag  sent for the car  
and left you 
of course they ll hear 
i m not saying goodbye  except to you 
but i never imagined
people wouldn t know 
i won t let you go 
goodbye  charlie 
susan 
please don t go 
please  susan 
from now on  everything will be
exactly the way you want it to be 
not the way i think you want it  but   
   your way 
you mustn t go 
you can t do this to me 
i see 
it s you that this is being done to 
it s not me at all 
not what it means to me 
i can t do this to you 
oh  yes  i can 
in case you haven t heard 
i lost all my money and it was plenty 
the last 10 years
have been difficult for many 
they haven t been tough on me 
i just lost all my money 
 you re going down to xanadu 
 monday  with boys from the office 
mr  rawlston wants
the whole place photographed 
we run a picture magazine 
if you re smart  you ll get in touch
with raymond  he s the butler 
you ll learn a lot from him 
he knows where all the bodies are buried 
you know  all the same 
i feel kind of sorry for mr  kane 
don t you think i do 
what do you know  it s morning already 
come around and tell me the story
of your life sometime 
rosebud 
i ll tell you about rosebud 
how much is it worth to you 
 1 000 
well  i ll tell you  mr  thompson 
 he acted funny sometimes  you know 
 no  i didn t 
yes  he did crazy things sometimes 
i ve been working for him 11 years now   
   in charge of the whole place 
so i ought to know 
 rosebud 
 yes 
like i tell you  the old man
acted kind of funny sometimes   
    but i knew how to handle him  
 need a lot of service 
but i knew how to handle him 
like that time his wife left 
rosebud 
i see 
and that s what you know about rosebud 
i heard him say it that other time  too 
he just said 
 rosebud  
then he dropped the glass ball
and it broke on the floor 
he didn t say anything after that 
and i knew he was dead 
he said all kinds of things
that didn t mean anything 
sentimental fellow  aren t you 
 yes and no 
 that isn t worth  1 000 
you can keep on asking questions
if you want to 
we re leaving tonight   
   when we re through taking pictures 
allow yourself plenty of time 
the train stops at the junction on signal 
but they don t like to wait 
i can remember when they d wait all day   
   if mr  kane said so 
better get going 
 can we come down 
 yes  hurry up  we re leaving 
how much do you think
this is all worth  mr  thompson 
millions 
if anybody wants it 
well  at least he brought all this stuff
to america 
 what s that 
 another venus 
 25 000 
a lot of money to pay
for a dame without a head 
the banks are out of luck 
 they ll clear all right 
 he never threw anything away 
 welcome home  mr  kane  from 467
employees of the new york inquirer  
 one stove from the estate of mary kane 
little salem  colorado  value   2  
we re supposed to get everything 
junk as well as art 
he sure liked to collect things 
anything and everything 
a regular crow  eh 
 hey  look  a jigsaw puzzle 
 we got a lot of those 
a burmese temple and three
spanish ceilings down the hall 
part of a scotch castle   
   that needs to be unwrapped 
put all this stuff together 
the palaces and the paintings 
and the toys and everything 
what would it spell 
 charles foster kane 
 or rosebud 
 how about it  jerry 
 what s rosebud 
that s what he said when he died 
did you ever find out what it means 
 no  i didn t 
 what did you find out about him 
not much  really 
we d better get started 
what have you been doing all this time 
playing with a jigsaw puzzle 
if you d discovered what rosebud meant 
i bet it would ve explained everything 
no  i don t think so 
no 
he was a man who got
everything he wanted  and then lost it 
maybe rosebud was something
he couldn t get or something he lost 
it wouldn t have explained anything 
i don t think any word
can explain a man s life 
no  i guess rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle 
a missing piece 
come on  everybody   
   we ll miss the train 
throw that junk in 
maybe i was what you nowadays
call a stooge 
everything was his idea   
   except my leaving him 
i ve got his trunk all packed 
i ve had it packed for a week now 
sometimes i think i d prefer
arrival of flesh and blood 
you re gonna need more than one lesson 
and you ll get more than one lesson 
who s a busy man  me 
i m chairman of the board 
i got nothing but time 
what do you want to know 
we thought     if we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying    
sentimental fellow  aren t you
