where kubla khan decreed
his stately pleasure dome
today almost as legendary
as floridas xanadu
the worlds largest
private pleasure ground
here on the deserts of the gulf coast
a private mountain
was commissioned and successfully built
one hundred thousand trees
twenty thousand tons of marble
are the ingredients
of xanadus mountain
contents of xanadus palace
paintings pictures statues
various stones of other palaces
a collection of everything
so big it can never
be catalogued or appraised
enough for 10 museums
the loot of the world
xanadus livestock
the fowl of the air the fish of the sea
the beast of the field and jungle
two of each
the biggest private zoo since noah
like the pharaohs
xanadus landlord leaves many stones
to mark his grave
since the pyramids
xanadu is the costliest monument
a man has built to himself
here in xanadu last week
xanadus landlord was laid to rest
a potent figure of our century
americas kubla khan
charles foster kane
its humble beginnings
in this ramshackle building a dying daily
kanes empire in its glory
held dominion over 37 newspapers
two syndicates
a radio network
an empire upon an empire
the first of grocery stores paper mills
apartment buildings
factories forests ocean liners
an empire through which for 50 years
flowed in an unending stream
the wealth of the earths
third richest gold mine
famed in american legend
is the origin of the kane fortune
how to boarding housekeeper mary kane
by a defaulting boarder in 1868
was left the supposedly worthless deed
to an abandoned mineshaft
the colorado lode
fiftyseven years later
before a congressional investigation
walter p thatcher
grand old man of wall street
for years chief target
of kane papers attacks on trusts
recalls a journey he made as a youth
my firm had been appointed trustee
by mrs kane
for a large fortune she recently acquired
it was her wish that i take charge
of this boy charles foster kane
chief is it not that on this occasion
charles foster kane
personally attacked you after striking you
in the stomach with a sled
i shall read to the committee
a prepared statement
which i have brought with me
and then refuse to answer questions
mr charles foster kane
in every essence of his social beliefs
and by the dangerous manner
he has persistently attacked
american traditions of private property
initiative and opportunity
for advancement
is in fact nothing more or less
than a communist
that same month in union square
the words charles foster kane
are a menace
to every workingman in this land
he is today what he has always been
and always will be a fascist
and still another opinion
kane urged his countrys entry
into one war
opposed participation in another
won the election
to one american president at least
spoke for millions of americans
was hated by as many more
for 40 years appeared in kane newsprint
no public issue
on which kane papers took no stand
no public man whom kane himself
did not support or denounce
often support then denounce
twice married twice divorced
first to a presidents niece
emily norton who left him in 1916
died 1918 in a motor accident
with their son
sixteen years after his first marriage
two weeks after his first divorce
kane married susan alexander
singer at the town hall
in trenton new jersey
for wife two
onetime operasinging susan alexander
kane built
chicagos municipal opera house
cost 3 million
conceived for susan alexander kane
halffinished before she divorced him
the still unfinished
xanadu
cost no man can say
kane molder of mass opinion
though he was
in all his life
was never granted elective office
by the voters of his country
but kane papers were once strong indeed
and once the prize seemed almost his
in 1916 as independent candidate
for governor
the best elements of the state
behind him
the white house seemingly the next
easy step in a lightning political career
then suddenly less than one week
before election
defeat
shameful ignominious
defeat that set back for 20 years
the cause of reform in the us
forever cancelled political chances
for charles foster kane
then in the first year
of the great depression
a kane paper closes
for kane in four short years collapse
eleven kane papers merged
more sold scrapped
is that correct
dont believe everything you hear
on the radio
read the inquirer
how were business conditions in europe
how did i find business conditions
in europe mr bones
with great difficulty
are you glad to be back
im always glad to be back
im an american
always been an american anything else
when i was a reporter
we asked them quicker than that
what do you think
of the chances for war in europe
i talked with the responsible leaders
of england france germany and italy
theyre too intelligent
to embark on a project
that would mean the end of civilization
you can take my word for it
there will be no war
kane helped to change the world
but kanes world now is history
and the great yellow journalist himself
lived to be history
outlived his power to make it
alone in his neverfinished
already decaying pleasure palace
aloof seldom visited
never photographed
an emperor of newsprint
continued to direct his failing empire
vainly attempted to sway as he once did
the destinies of a nation
that had ceased to listen to him
ceased to trust him
then last week as it must to all men
death came to charles foster kane
news on the march
thats it
stand by
ill tell you if we want to run it again
how about it mr rawlston
how do you like it boys
seventy years in a mans life
thats a lot to try to get into a newsreel
its a good short
but what it needs is an angle
all we saw on that screen
was that charles foster kane is dead
i know that i read the papers
it isnt enough to tell us what a man did
youve got to tell us who he was
wait a minute
what were kanes last words
do you remember boys
what were the last words
he said on earth
maybe he told us about himself
on his deathbed
maybe he didnt
all we saw was a big american
how did he differ from ford
hearst or john doe
i tell you a mans dying words
what were they
you dont read the papers
when charles foster kane died
he said one word
rosebud
thats all he said tough guy
yes rosebud just that one word
but who is she
what was it
heres a man
who couldve been president
who was as loved
hated and talked about
as any man in our time
but when he dies
something is on his mind called rosebud
what does that mean
a racehorse he bet on once
that didnt come in
but what was the race
rosebud
thompson
yes
hold this up a week two if you must
dont you think right after hes dead
find out about rosebud get in touch
with anybody who knew him
or knew him well
that manager of his
bernstein his second wife
shes still living
susan alexander kane
she runs a nightclub in atlantic city
thats right
see them all get in touch with everybody
that ever worked for him
whoever loved him
whoever hated his guts
i dont mean go through
the city directory of course
ill get on it right away

it will probably turn out to be
a very simple thing
miss alexander
this is mr thompson miss alexander
i want another drink john

hey
john
you just might be able to help me
when she used to talk about mr kane
did she ever mention rosebud
rosebud
thank you mr thompson thanks
as a matter of fact just the other day
when the papers were full of it
l asked her
she never heard of rosebud
the directors of the thatcher memorial
library have asked me to remind you
about the conditions
under which you may
inspect certain portions
of mr thatchers unpublished memoirs
l remember them
yes jennings ill bring him in
all i want is an hour
under no circumstances
are direct quotes from his manuscript
to be used by you you may follow me
thats all right im just looking for
jennings
thank you jennings
you will be required to leave this room
at 430 promptly
you will confine yourself
it is our understanding
to the chapters in mr thatchers
manuscript regarding mr kane
thats all im interested in
thank you
pages 83 to 142
come on boys
be careful charles
mrs kane
pull your muffler around your neck
charles
mrs kane
i think well have to tell him now
yes ill sign those papers now
mr thatcher
you people seem to forget
that im the boys father
its going to be done
exactly the way ive told mr thatcher
theres nothing wrong with colorado
i dont see why we cant raise our son
just cause we came into money
if i want to i can go to court
a father has a right to
a boarder that beats his bill
and leaves worthless stock behind
that property is as much my property
as anybodys
now that its valuable
and if fred graves had any idea
this would happen hed have made out
the certificates in both our names
but theyre made out to mrs kane
he owed the money to both of us
the banks decision in all matters
l dont hold with giving charles to a bank
stop this nonsense
were a bit uneducated
the banks decision
concerning his education
his places of residence is to be final
the idea of a bank being the guardian
stop this nonsense jim
we will assume full management
of the colorado lode
which i repeat mrs kane
you are the sole owner
where do i sign mr thatcher
right here
mary im asking you for the last time
youd think i hadnt been
a good husband or father
the sum of 50000 a year
is to be paid to you
and mr kane as long as you both live
and thereafter to the survivor
lets hope its all for the best
it is
why i cant raise my own boy
is more than i can understand
go on mr thatcher
everything else the principal
as well as all monies earned
is to be administered by the bank in trust
for your son charles foster kane
until he reaches his 25th birthday
at which time
he is to come into complete possession
charles
go on mr thatcher
its almost 500
dont you think id better meet the boy
ive got his trunk all packed
ive had it packed for a week now
ive arranged for a tutor
to meet us in chicago
id have brought him here with me but
charles
look mom
youd better come inside

and a happy new year
in closing
may i remind you your 25th birthday
which is now approaching
marks your complete independence
from the firm
of thatcher  company
as well as acquiring the full responsibility
for the worlds sixth largest
private fortune
got that
the worlds sixth largest private fortune
i dont think you realize the full importance
of the position you are to occupy
i am therefore enclosing
for your consideration
a list of your holdings
extensively crossindexed
dear mr thatcher
its from mr kane
go on
sorry im not interested in gold mines
oil wells shipping or real estate
not interested
one item on your list intrigues me
the new york inquirer
a little newspaper we acquired
in a foreclosure proceeding
dont sell it
i am coming back to take charge
l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper
l think it would be fun
to run a newspaper
traction trust exposed
traction trust bleeds public white
traction trust smashed by inquirer
landlords refuse to clear slums
inquirer wins slum fight
wall street backs copper swindle
copper robbers indicted
galleons of spain off jersey coast
is that really your idea
of how to run a newspaper
i dont know how to run a newspaper
i try everything i can think of
you know theres not
the slightest proof this
armadas off the jersey coast
hello mr bernstein
can you prove it isnt
mr bernstein
id like you to meet mr thatcher
mr leland
hello
mr thatcher my exguardian
we have no secrets from our readers
thatcher is one of our devoted readers
he knows whats wrong with every copy
of the inquirer since i took over read
girls delightful in cuba stop
could send you prose poems
about scenery but dont feel right
spending your money stop
there is no war in cuba
signed wheeler any answer
yes dear wheeler you provide
the prose poems ill provide the war
thats fine
l like it myself send it right away
i came to see you
about this campaign of yours
the inquirers campaign against
the public transit company
do you know anything
we can use against them
youre still the college boy eh
i was expelled from college a lot
of colleges you remember i remember
i think i should remind you of a fact
you have forgotten
youre one of the largest stockholders
in the public transit company
the trouble is you dont realize
youre talking to two people
as charles foster kane
who owns 82364 shares
of public transit preferred see
i do have a general idea of my holdings
i sympathize with you
kane is a scoundrel
his paper should be closed
a committee formed to boycott him
if you can form such a committee
put me down for a contribution of 1000
on the other hand
i am the publisher of the inquirer
as such its my duty ill let you in
on a little secret it is also my pleasure
to see that the working people of this
community arent robbed by a pack
of moneymad pirates just because
they have no one
to look after their interests
ill let you in on another little secret
mr thatcher
i think im the man to do it
you see i have money and property
if i dont look after the interests
of the underprivileged somebody else will
maybe somebody
without money or property
that would be too bad
i saw your financial statement today
oh did you
tell me honestly
dont you think its rather unwise
to continue this philanthropic enterprise
this inquirer that is costing you
1 million a year
yes i did lose 1 million last year
i expect to lose 1 million this year
i expect to lose 1 million next year
at the rate of 1 million a year
ill have to close this place in 60 years
with respect to the said newspapers
the said charles foster kane
hereby relinquishes all control thereof
and of the syndicates
pertaining thereto
and any and all other newspaper press
and publishing properties of any kind
and agrees to abandon
all claim thereto
which means were bust all right
well out of cash
all right mr bernstein
ive read it mr thatcher
just let me sign it and go home
youre too old
to call me mr thatcher charles
youre too old to be called anything else
you were always too old
in consideration thereof
thatcher  company agrees
to pay to charles foster kane
as long as he lives
my allowance
you will continue to maintain
over your newspapers a large
measure of control
measure of control
and we shall seek your advice
this depression is temporary
theres always the chance
that youll die richer than i will
its a cinch ill die richer than i was born
we never lost as much as we made
yes yes but your methods
you know charles
you never made a single investment
you always used money to
to buy things
to buy things
my mother should have chosen
a less reliable banker
i always gagged on that silver spoon
you know mr bernstein
if i hadnt been very rich
l might have been a really great man
dont you think you are
i think i did pretty well
under the circumstances
what would you like to have been
everything you hate
i beg your pardon sir what did you say
its 430 isnt it jennings
yes maam
you have enjoyed a very rare privilege
young man
did you find what you were looking for
no
youre not rosebud are you
what
rosebud and your name is jennings
isnt it
goodbye everybody
thanks for the use of the hall
whos a busy man me
im chairman of the board
i got nothing but time
what do you want to know
we thought maybe if we could
find out what he meant by his last words
as he was dying
that rosebud
maybe some girl
there were a lot of them in the early days
its hardly likely that mr kane
could have met someone casually
and then 50 years later on his deathbed
well youre pretty young mr thompson
a fellow will remember a lot of things
you wouldnt think hed remember
you take me
one day back in 1896
i was crossing over to jersey on the ferry
and as we pulled out
there was another ferry pulling in
and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off
a white dress she had on
she was carrying a white parasol
i only saw her for one second
she didnt see me at all
but ill bet a month hasnt gone by since
that i havent thought of that girl
who else have you been to see
well i went down to atlantic city
susie
thank you
i called her myself the day after he died
i thought maybe somebody ought to
she couldnt even come to the phone
ill be seeing her again in a couple of days
about rosebud mr bernstein
if youd talk about anything connected
with mr kane that you can remember
you were with him from the beginning
from before the beginning young fellow
and now its after the end
have you tried to see anybody
except susie
i havent seen anybody else but ive
been through walter thatchers journal
that man was the biggest fool i ever met
he made an awful lot of money
well its no trick to make a lot of money
if all you want is to make a lot of money
you take mr kane
it wasnt money he wanted
thatcher never did figure him out
sometimes even i couldnt
you know who you ought to see
mr leland
he was mr kanes closest friend
they went to school together
harvard
oh harvard yale princeton
cornell switzerland
he was thrown out of a lot of colleges
mr leland never had a nickel
one of those families
where the father is worth 10 million
then one day he shoots himself
and it turns out theres nothing but debts
he was with mr kane and me
the first day mr kane took over
the inquirer
take a good look at it jedediah
its going to look a lot different
one of these days come on

a threecolumn headline
the news wasnt big enough
mr carter if the headline is big enough
it makes the news big enough
thats right
the murder of mrs harry silverstone
theres no proof
that she was murdered or dead
it says shes missing
the neighbors are getting suspicious
its not our function
to report the gossip of housewives
if we were interested in that kind of thing
we could fill the paper twice over daily
thats the kind of thing we are going to be
interested in from now on
i want you to send your best man
to see mr silverstone
have him tell mr silverstone if he doesnt
produce his wife mrs silverstone
the inquirer will have him arrested
tell mr silverstone
hes a detective from
central office
the central office
if mr silverstone gets suspicious
and asks to see your mans badge
your man is to get indignant
and call mr silverstone an anarchist
loudly so the neighbors can hear
you ready for dinner jedediah
i cant see that the function
of a respectable newspaper
thank you so much mr carter goodbye

yes
maybe that was something he lost
mr kane was a man who lost
almost everything he had
you ought to see jed leland
of course he and mr kane
didnt exactly see eye to eye
you take the spanishamerican war
i guess mr leland was right
that was mr kanes war
we didnt really have anything
to fight about
do you think if it hadnt been for that war
of mr kanes
wed have the panama canal
i wish i knew where mr leland was
a lot of the time now
they dont tell me these things
maybe even hes dead
in case youd like to know
hes at the huntington memorial hospital
on 180th street
you dont say i had
nothing particular the matter with him
they tell me just
just old age
its the only disease that you dont
look forward to being cured of
i can remember absolutely everything
young man
thats my curse
thats one of the greatest curses
ever inflicted on the human race memory
i was his oldest friend and as far as
i was concerned he behaved like a swine
not that charlie was ever brutal
he just did brutal things
maybe i wasnt his friend
but if i wasnt he never had one
maybe i was what you nowadays
call a stooge
you were about to say something
about rosebud
do you happen to have a good cigar
ive got a young physician here
who thinks im going to give up smoking
no im afraid i havent sorry
i changed the subject didnt l
what a disagreeable old man
i have become
youre a reporter and you want to know
what i think about charlie kane
i suppose he had some private sort
of greatness
but he kept it to himself
he never gave himself away
he never gave anything away
he just left you a tip
he had a generous mind
i dont suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions
but he never believed in anything
except charlie kane
he never had a conviction
except charlie kane in his life
i suppose he died without one
that must have been pretty unpleasant
of course a lot of us check out without
having any special convictions about death
but we do know what were leaving
we do believe in something
are you absolutely sure
you havent got a cigar
sorry mr leland
never mind
what do you know about rosebud
rosebud
his dying words rosebud
i saw that in the inquirer
i never believed anything
i saw in the inquirer
anything else
i can tell you about emily
i went to dancing school with emily
i was very graceful
we were talking about the first mrs kane
what was she like
she was like all the girls i knew
in dancing school
very nice girl emily was a little nicer
after the first couple of months
she and charlie didnt see much
of each other except at breakfast
it was a marriage
just like any other marriage
youre beautiful
l cant be
yes you are youre very beautiful
ive never been to six parties
in one night before
ive never been up this late
its a matter of habit
what will the servants think
that we enjoyed ourselves
why do you have to go straight off
to the newspaper
you never shouldve married a
newspaperman theyre worse than sailors
i absolutely adore you
charles even newspapermen
have to sleep
ill call mr bernstein and have him
put off my appointments till noon
what time is it
i dont know its late
its early
charles
do you know how long
you kept me waiting last night
when you went to the newspaper
for 10 minutes
what do you do in a newspaper
in the middle of the night
my dear your only correspondent
is the inquirer
sometimes i think id prefer a rival
of flesh and blood
i dont spend that much time
on the newspaper
it isnt just the time
its what you print attacking the president
you mean uncle john
l mean the president of the united states
hes still uncle john
and a wellmeaning fathead
whos letting a pack of highpressure
crooks run his administration
this whole oil scandal
he happens to be the president not you
thats a mistake that will be corrected
one of these days
your mr bernstein sent junior
the most incredible atrocity yesterday
i simply cant have it in the nursery
mr bernstein is apt to pay a visit
to the nursery now and then
does he have to
yes
really charles people will think
what i tell them to think
wasnt he ever in love with her
he married for love
love
that is why he did everything
thats why he went into politics
it seems we werent enough
he wanted all the voters to love him too
all he wanted out of life was love
thats charlies story how he lost it
you see he just didnt have any to give
he loved charlie kane of course
very dearly
and his mother
i guess he always loved her
how about his second wife
susan alexander
you know what charlie called her
the day after hed met her
he told me about her
he said she was
a crosssection of the american public
i guess he couldnt help it
she must have had something for him
that first night according to charlie
all she had was a toothache
what are you laughing at young lady
whats the matter with you
toothache
what
toothache
toothache
you mean youve got a toothache
whats funny about that
youre funny mister
youve got dirt on your face
not dirt its mud
do you want some hot water
i live right here
whats that young lady
i said if you wanted some hot water
l could get you somehot water
all right thank you very much
do i look any better now
this medicine doesnt do a bit of good
what you need is to get your mind off it
excuse me but my landlady
prefers me to keep this door open
when i have a gentleman caller
all right
you have got a toothache havent you
l surely have
why dont you try laughing at me again
what
im still pretty funny
i know but you dont want me
to laugh at you
i dont want your tooth to hurt either
look at me
see that
what are you doing
im wiggling both my ears
at the same time
thats it smile
it took me two solid years at the best
boys school in the world to learn that
the fellow who taught me
is now president of venezuela
thats it
is it a giraffe
no not a giraffe
l bet it is
what
well then its an elephant
its supposed to be a rooster
a rooster
you know an awful lot of tricks
are you a professional magician
no im not a magician
l was just joking
you really dont know who i am
you told me your name mr kane
but im awfully ignorant
i guess you caught on to that
i bet ive heard your name a million times
you really like me though
even though you dont know who i am
i surely do youve been wonderful
without you i dont know
what i would have done
i had a toothache
and i dont know many people
i know too many people
i guess were both lonely
want to know what i was going to do
before i ruined my best sunday clothes
i bet theyre not your best sunday clothes
you probably have more
i was just joking
i was on my way
to the western manhattan warehouse
in search of my youth
you see my mother died a long time ago
her things were put in storage out west
there wasnt any other place to put them
i thought id send for them now
tonight i was going to take a look at them
a sort of sentimental journey
i run a couple of newspapers
what do you do
me
how old did you say you were
l didnt say
if you had i wouldnt have asked you
how old
pretty old
how old
twentytwo in august
thats a ripe old age what do you do
i work at seligmans
im in charge of the sheet music
is that what you want to do
no i wanted to be a singer i guess
that is i didnt my mother did for me
what happened to the singing
mother always thought she always talked
about grand opera for me
imagine
but my voice isnt that kind
its just you know what mothers are like
yes
have you got a piano
a piano
yes theres one in the parlor
would you sing for me
you wouldnt want to hear me sing
yes i would
dont tell me
your toothache is bothering you
no thats all gone
all right
lets go to the parlor
yes lindor shall be mine
l have sworn it
for weal or woe
yes lindor
lo giurai
la vinceró
there is only one man
who can rid the politics
of this state of the evil domination
of boss jim gettys
i am speaking of charles foster kane
the fighting liberal
the friend of the workingman
the next governor of this state
who entered upon this campaign
with one purpose only
to point out
and make public the dishonesty
the downright villainy
of boss jim w gettys political machine
now in complete control
of the government of this state
i made no campaign promises
because until a few weeks ago
i had no hope of being elected
now however l have something more
than a hope
jim gettys has something less
than a chance
every straw vote
every independent poll shows
that l will be elected
very well
now l can afford to make some promises
the workingman and the slum child
know they can expect
my best efforts in their interests
the decent ordinary citizens know
that ill do everything in my power
to protect the underprivileged
the underpaid and the underfed
mother is pop governor yet
not yet junior
id make my promises now
if i werent too busy
arranging to keep them
but heres one promise ill make
and boss jim gettys knows ill keep it
my first official act
as governor of this state
will be to appoint a special district
attorney to arrange for the indictment
prosecution and conviction
of boss jim w gettys
if the election were held today
youd be in by 100000 votes
gettys isnt even pretending
pop
hello son
he isnt just scared hes sick
its beginning to dawn on jim gettys
i mean what i say
did you like your old mans speech
l could hear every word
hello emily
hold it
great speech mr kane
wonderful
will you get us a taxi
im sending junior home
in the car with oliver
good night father
goodbye son
why did you send junior home in the car
what are you doing in a taxi
theres a call i want you to make with me
it can wait
no it cant
whats this all about emily
it may not be about anything at all
i intend to find out
where are you going
im going to 185 west 74th street
if you wish you may come with me
ill come with you
i had no idea you had this flair
for melodrama emily
come right in mr kane
charlie
he forced me to send your wife that letter
i didnt want to
hes been saying the most terrible
mrs kane
i dont suppose
anybody would introduce us
im jim gettys
yes
i made miss alexander send you the note
mrs kane
she didnt want to at first but she did it
charlie the things he said to me
he threatened to
i wont wait until im elected
to start with i think ill break your neck
maybe you can do it and maybe you cant
your breaking this mans neck
would scarcely explain this note
serious consequences for mr kane
for yourself and for your son
he wanted to get her to come here
what does this note mean
im susan alexander
i know what youre thinking
what does this note mean ms alexander
she dont know
she sent it because i told her
it wouldnt be smart not to
emily this gentleman
im not a gentleman
your husband is only trying to be funny
calling me one
i dont even know what a gentleman is
you see my idea of a gentleman
if i owned a paper and didnt like
the way somebody was doing things
some politician
id fight him with all i had
i wouldnt show him in a convict suit
so his family could see his picture
in the paper
youre a cheap crooked grafter
were talking now about what you are
im fighting for my life
not just my political life
he said unless you
thats what i said
heres the chance im willing to give him
its more of a chance than hed give me
unless he decides by tomorrow that
hes so sick he has to go away for a year
monday morning all papers in the state
except his will carry the story ill give
what story
the story about him and ms alexander
there isnt any story
shut up
weve got evidence that would look bad
in the headlines
do you want me to give you the evidence
id rather he withdrew
without having the story published
not that i care about him
but id be better off that way
so would you mrs kane
what about me
he said my name would be dragged
through the mud that everywhere i went
there seems to be only one decision
you can make charles
id say that itd been made for you
you cant tell me the voters of this state
im not interested in the voters
of this state right now
i am interested in our son
charlie if they publish this story
they wont
good night mr gettys
are you coming charles
no
im staying here
i can fight this all alone
if you dont listen to reason
it may be too late
too late for what
for you and this public thief
to take the love of the people
away from me
you got other things to think about
your little boy
you dont want him to read about you
in the papers
theres only one person in the world
to decide what ill do and thats me
you decided what you were going to do
charles some time ago
youre making a bigger fool of yourself
than i thought
ive got nothing to say to you
youre licked
get out if you want to see me
have the warden write me a letter
if it was anybody else id say whats going
to happen to you would be a lesson to you
only youre going to need
more than one lesson
and youll get more than one lesson
dont worry about me gettys
dont worry about me
im charles foster kane
im no cheap crooked politician
trying to save himself
from the consequences of his crimes
gettys im gonna send you to sing sing
sing sing gettys
have you a car mrs kane
yes thank you
good night
good night
paper read all about it extra extra
paper
no thanks
with a million majority
already against him
and the church counties
still to be heard from
im afraid we got no choice
this one
that one
good night again
is there anything i can
no thanks mr bernstein
you better go home and get some sleep
you too
good night mr kane
hello jedediah
im drunk
if youve got drunk to talk to me about
ms alexander dont bother
im not interested
ive set back the sacred cause of reform
is that it
all right
if thats the way they want it
the people have made their choice
its obvious the people prefer
jim gettys to me
you talk about the people
as though you owned them
as though they belong to you goodness
as long as i can remember youve talked
about giving the people their rights
as if you could make them
a present of liberty
as a reward for services rendered
jed
you remember the workingman
ill get drunk too jedediah
if itll do any good
it wont do any good
besides you never get drunk
you used to write an awful lot
about the workingman
go on home
hes turning into something called
organized labor
you wont like that one little bit
when you find out
it means your workingman expects
something as his right and not your gift
when your precious underprivileged
really get together
oh boy
thatll add up to something
bigger than your privilege
then i dont know what youll do
sail away to a desert island probably
and lord it over the monkeys
i wouldnt worry about it too much
therell probably be a few of them there
to tell me when i do something wrong
you may not always be so lucky
youre not very drunk
drunk what do you care
you dont care about anything except you
you persuade people that you love them
so much that they ought to love you back
only you want love on your own terms
its something to be played your way
according to your rules
let me work on the chicago paper
what
you said you were looking for someone
to do dramatic crimitism criticism
i am drunk
i want to go to chicago
youre too valuable here
theres nothing left for me to do
all right you can go to chicago
thank you
i guess id better try to get drunk anyway
i warn you jedediah
you wont like chicago
the wind comes off the lake and theyve
probably never heard of lobster newburg
will saturday after next be all right
anytime you say
thank you
a toast to love on my terms
those are the only terms anybody knows
his own
mr kane im from the inquirer
whats that young man
are you through with politics
am i through with politics
i would say vice versa
were going to be an opera star
are you singing at the metropolitan
we certainly are
charlie said if i didnt
hed build me an opera house
that wont be necessary
no no no
places please
mr leland is writing it
from the dramatic angle
and weve covered it from the news end
and the social
how about the music notice
yes its already made up
mr mowan wrote a swell review
enthusiastic
yes sir
mr kane this is a surprise
weve got two spreads of pictures
the music notice on the front page
but theres still one notice to come
the dramatic
the dramatic notice
mr bernstein thats mr leland isnt it
yes were waiting for it
where is he
right in there mr kane
mr kane
mr leland and mr kane
havent spoken together for years
you dont suppose
theres nothing to suppose
excuse me
close the door
he aint been drinking before
never we would have heard
what does it say there
the notice whats he written
miss susan alexander a pretty
but hopelessly incompetent amateur
last night opened
the new chicago opera house
in a performance of
i still cant pronounce that name
her singing happily
is no concern of this department
of her acting
it is absolutely impossible to
go on
thats all there is
of her acting it is absolutely
impossible to say anything except
that in the opinion of this reviewer
it represents a new low
in the opinion of this reviewer
l didnt see that
it isnt here mr bernstein im dictating it
mr kane l
get me a typewriter
im going to finish mr lelands notice
hello bernstein
hello
hello mr leland
wheres my notice bernstein
ive got to finish my notice
mr kane is finishing it for you
charlie
charlie out there
i guess hes fixing it up
i knew id never get that through
mr kanes finishing your review
just the way you started it
hes writing a bad notice
like you wanted it to be
i guess thatll show you
hello jedediah
hello charlie
i didnt know we were speaking
sure were speaking jedediah
youre fired
everybody knows that story mr leland
but why did he do it
how could a man write a notice
you just dont know charlie
he thought that by finishing that notice
hed show me he was an honest man
he was always trying to prove something
that whole thing about susie
being an opera singer
that was trying to prove something
you know what the headline was
the day before the election
candidate kane found
in love nest with singer
he was going to take
the quotes off the singer
hey nurse
five years ago he wrote
from that place down there in the south
whats it called shangrila ei dorado
sloppy joes whats the name
all right xanadu i knew it all the time
you caught on didnt you
im not that hard to see through
well i never even answered his letter
maybe i should have
i guess he was pretty lonely down there
in that coliseum all those years
he hadnt finished it when she left him
he never finished it
he never finished anything
except my notice
of course he built the joint for her
that must have been love
i dont know
he was disappointed in the world
so he built his own an absolute monarchy
it was something bigger
than an opera house anyway
nurse
yes mr leland
im coming
theres one thing you can do for me
sure
stop at the cigar store on your way out
and get me a couple of good cigars
be glad to
thank you
one is enough
when i was a young man there was
an impression that nurses were pretty
well it was no truer then than it is today
ill take your arm
all right
you wont forget about those cigars
l wont
have them wrapped like toothpaste
or theyll stop them at the desk
you know that young doctor
i was telling you about well
hes got an idea
he wants to keep me alive
id rather youd just talk
anything that comes into your mind
about yourself and mr kane
you dont want to hear what comes into
my mind about myself and charlie kane
you know maybe i shouldnt have sung
for charlie that first time i met him
but i did an awful lot of singing after that
i sang for teachers at 100 an hour
the teachers got that i didnt
what did you get
i didnt get a thing except music lessons
thats all there was in it
he married you didnt he
he didnt mention anything about marriage
until after it was over and
until it got in the papers about us
and he lost the election
and that norton woman divorced him
he was really interested in my voice
why did he build that opera house
i didnt want it i didnt want a thing
it was his idea
everything was his idea
except my leaving him
dont forget
dont get nervous
please lets come back
look at me mrs kane darling
get the voice out of the throat
place the tone right in the mask
diaphragm
youre out of pitch
some people can sing some cant
impossible
its not your job to give your opinion
of mrs kanes talents
youre supposed to train her voice
signor matiste nothing more
please continue with the lesson
but mr kane
please
ill be the laughingstock
of the musical world people will think
youre concerned what people will think
perhaps i can enlighten you a bit
im an authority on what people will think
the newspapers for example
i run several newspapers
between here and san francisco
its all right darling
signor matiste is going to listen to reason
how can i persuade you
you cant
its all right darling go ahead
i thought youd see it my way
no no no
ah cruel
tu mas trop entendue
les dieux men sont témoins
ces dieux qui dans mon flanc
ont allumé
le feu fatal
a tout mon sang
ditesmoi comment jexpie
ce péché si fort
toujours remplie
je ne peux pas résister encore
oh dieux arrachezmoi
ces feux fatals
i think its dreadful
allument ma mort
voilà mon coeur
voilà mon coeur
cest là que ta main doit frapper
voilà mon coeur
frappe
prêtemoi ton épée
frappe
stop telling me hes your friend
a friend dont write that kind of review
all these other papers panning me
i could expect that
but for the inquirer to run a thing like that
spoiling my whole debut
come in
ill get it
friend not the kind of friends i know
but im not high class like you
and i never went to any swell schools
thatll be enough susan
from mr leland sir
he wanted me to make sure
you got this personally
is that something from him
charlie
as for you
you ought to have your head examined
sending him a letter telling him hes fired
with a 25000 check in it
what kind of firing do you call that
you did send him a check for 25000
didnt you
yes
i sent him a check for 25000
whats that
declaration of principles
what
what is it
an antique
youre awful funny arent you
ill tell you one thing youre not going
to be funny about and thats my singing
im through
i never wanted to do it in the first place
youll continue with your singing susan
i dont propose
to have myself made ridiculous
you dont propose
to have yourself made ridiculous
what about me
im the one that has to sing
im the one that gets the raspberries
why dont you leave me alone
my reasons satisfy me susan
you seem unable to understand them
i will not tell them to you again
youll continue with your singing
get dr corey
susan
shell be perfectly all right
in a day or two mr kane
i cant imagine how mrs kane
came to make such a foolish mistake
the sedative dr wagner gave her
was in a somewhat larger bottle
the strain of preparing for the new opera
has excited and confused her
yes im sure that was it
no objections to my staying
with her are there
no not at all
id like the nurse to be here too
good night mr kane
charlie
i couldnt make you see how i felt charlie
but i couldnt go through
with the singing again
you dont know what it means
to know that people
that the whole audience doesnt want you
thats when you got to fight them
all right
you wont have to fight them anymore
its their loss
what are you doing
jigsaw puzzles
charlie what time is it
in new york
i said what time is it in new york
11 30
night
the bulldogs just gone to press
well hurray for the bulldog
gee 1130 shows are just getting up
people are going to nightclubs
and restaurants
of course were different
because we live in a palace
you always said you wanted
to live in a palace
a person could go crazy in this dump
nobody to talk to
nobody to have any fun with
49000 acres of nothing
but scenery and statues
im lonesome
until yesterday weve had no less
than 50 of your friends at any one time
i think if you look in the west wing
youll probably find a dozen vacationists
still in residence
you make a joke out of everything
charlie i want to go to new york
im tired of being a hostess
i want to have fun please charlie
charlie please
our home is here susan
i dont care to visit new york
what are you doing
one thing i can never understand
how do you know
you havent done it before
it makes a whole lot more sense
than collecting statues
you may be right
i sometimes wonder
but you get into the habit
its not a habit i do it because i like it
i thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow
invite everybody to spend the night
at the everglades
invite everybody order everybody
you mean and make them sleep in tents
who wants to sleep in tents
when theyve got their own room
with a bath where they know
where everything is
i thought we might have
a picnic tomorrow
you never give me anything
i really care about
it cant be love
for there is no true love
l know ive played at the game
like a moth in a blue flame
lost in the end just the same
all these years
my hearts been floating around
in a puddle of tears
l wonder what it is
sure you give me things
but that dont mean anything to you
youre in a tent darling
youre not at home
i can hear you very well
if you speak in a normal tone of voice
whats the difference between giving me
a bracelet or giving someone 100000
for a statue youll keep crated up
and never look at
its just money it doesnt mean anything
you never really gave me anything
that you care about
i want you to stop this
im not going to stop it
you never gave me anything in your life
you just tried to buy me
into giving you something
it cant be love
whatever i do i do because i love you
you dont love me
you want me to love you
sure im charles foster kane
whatever you want
just name it and its yours
but you gotta love me
dont tell me youre sorry
im not sorry
mr kane

the palaces and the paintings
and the toys and everything
what would it spell
charles foster kane
or rosebud
how about it jerry
whats rosebud
thats what he said when he died
did you ever find out what it means
no i didnt
what did you find out about him
not much really
wed better get started
what have you been doing all this time
playing with a jigsaw puzzle
if youd discovered what rosebud meant
i bet it wouldve explained everything
no i dont think so
no
he was a man who got
everything he wanted and then lost it
maybe rosebud was something
he couldnt get or something he lost
it wouldnt have explained anything
i dont think any word
can explain a mans life
no i guess rosebud is just a piece
in a jigsaw puzzle
a missing piece
come on everybody
well miss the train
throw that junk in
maybe i was what you nowadays
call a stooge
everything was his idea
except my leaving him
ive got his trunk all packed
ive had it packed for a week now
sometimes i think id prefer
arrival of flesh and blood
youre gonna need more than one lesson
and youll get more than one lesson
whos a busy man me
im chairman of the board
i got nothing but time
what do you want to know
we thought if we could find out what he
meant by his last words as he was dying
sentimental fellow arent you
