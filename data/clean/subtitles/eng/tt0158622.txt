when wilma finds out
what a loser her new boyfriend is 
of course  she doesn t have to find out 
she doesn t  see that 
i knew you were a good guy 
i m not 
i said i wouldn t tell her 
i didn t say you could still have her 
i ll erase your debt  flintstone 
but you ve gotta disappear 
out of town  out of bedrock 
and never see or speak to wilma again 
wait a minute 
you had this planned all along 
tell me  how do you
even dress yourself in the morning 
normally  i just wear what i fell asleep in 
what s that gotta do with anything 
goodbye  flintstone 
hey  you won t get away with this 
rockefeller

you know what 
i don t care what happens to me 
but i m not gonna
let you weasel your way closer to wilma 
soon as i find her 
i m gonna tell her exactly what s going on 
then we ll see how well your plan worked 
what the   
there has been a robbery 
all guests to the lobby 
uh oh  there appears to have been a robbery 
we ll have to continue this conversation later 
fred  please  step this way 
ladies and gentlemen 
ladies and gentlemen  i regret to inform you
there is a criminal in our midst 
how old did you say you were 
but before i expose him to the public 
i d like to give him the chance
to step forward and admit his wrongdoing 
if only to take the first
tiny step toward absolution 
i stole all the towels in my room 
well  that is illegal  but still   
i m wearing someone else s underwear 
eww 
no  i was talking about a   
i m systematically poisoning
the dinosaurs  water supply 
in a matter of decades 
their entire species will be extinct 
all right  this is obviously going nowhere 
i was talking about a necklace 
a very valuable necklace
has been stolen from our hotel safe 
a necklace belonging to my dear 
dear friend  wilma slaghoople 
  my pearls 
  wilma 
all right  who did it 
so help me  if you don t
step forward right now  i will personally   
i don t think violence
will be necessary  flintstone 
because i know exactly
who stole wilma s pearls 
a desperate man 
drowning in gambling debts 
lowlife 
hey  doesn t anybody care about this whole
dinosaurs becoming extinct thing 
no 
fred  would you mind
emptying your pockets 
you think i stole wilma s pearls 
chip  that s   
why  do you have something to hide  fred 
definitely not  see for yourself 
i m not   
fred 
wait a minute  i didn t take these 
wilma  why would i take your pearls 
do you deny that you owe the casino over
a million clams with no way to pay it back 
fred  is that true 
yeah  but   
wilma  darling  i m so sorry 
wilma  wilma 
wilma  you can t believe him  he set me up 
security  take this man to jail 
you re coming with us 
  hey  hey  hey 
  wait a minute  wait a minute  wait a minute 
you re all making a big mistake 
fred couldn t have stolen that necklace 
it was locked up in a safe 
fred can t even remember
the combination to his bowling locker 
look  he s gotta write it down
on his hand  see 
ah  great  now everybody s seen it 
huh  crack a safe  he couldn t even
crack his knuckles without my help 
thank you  mr  rubble  for confessing
to being mr  flintstone s accomplice 
you re welcome  what 
take them both away 
believe me  i m innocent 
everybody  gamble 
where s my little girl 
oh  my poor  poor baby 
perfect 
everything s going to be all right now 
darling  mummy s here 
and i m going 
wilma  i ve already talked to chip 
and he s willing to take you back 
what gives you the right
to interfere with my life 
i m your mother  and i love you 
and chip loves you 
chip loves money 
and you have money 
it s a match made in heaven 
oh  wilma 
look  i think he s already proven his loyalty 
he saved you from that beast 
fred is not a beast 
he was just raised by them 
ah  that explains the missing piece
of the puzzle 
wilma  listen to me  go back to chip 
please 
darling 
don t let chip slip through your fingers again 
i just don t know how much more
pain that poor boy can endure 
i said you ll have your money by midnight

see  a little birdie told him
that you ain t even dating
the slaghoople dame no more 
hey  i might be out of a job tomorrow

my race has prospered for eons without
the slightest trace of personal emotions

  but    i love barney 
well  i don t care  i m in love with betty too
