crash of southjet flight 2 2 7

around looking for answers

pilot  captain whip whitaker

same way i believe god should hit the
buffet  the turkey sausage is excellent 
no  i m fine with coffee  thank you 
so len caldwell really wanted
to get here this morning 
len s the president of the pilots  union 
he wanted to be here to
meet with us  and you 
but they needed him at the crash site 
so as you know  when a plane goes down 
the ntsb sends a  go team 
to the crash site immediately 
they find the flight data recorders 
  they did  it s perfectly intact 
  oh  great  then that solves everything 
so  why do we need a lawyer from chicago 
well    hugh specializes
in criminal negligence 
  criminal negligence 
  hmm hmm 
death demands responsibility 
six dead on that plane 
someone has to pay 
yeah  but that s a plane
that fell apart at   
think it fell apart at 30 thousand feet 
and the airline will try to
prove equipment failure 
which is gonna make the manufacturer
responsible  the manufacturer in turn
is gonna try and prove poor maintenance
of the equipment by the airline 
or pilot error 
i flew the plane inverted 
that means upside down  hugh 
you get the picture  a hundred people
upside down  500 feet off the ground 
you have any idea what that s like 
i do  i  uh    heard the
black box recordings last night 
oh you heard  so you re a pilot 
no  no 
then you know what the fuck
you re talking about  do you 
hugh s on our team  whip 
  is he 
  yeah  he is 
  he didn  act like he gonna
  obviously   
  have to imagine me questions
  well  he is  yeah but   
  like a fucking pilot 
  listen to me 
  and that he knows something 
  it s the ntsb s ball game 
they run the investigation  and
they will ultimately rule on the cause 
and that s why we need him 
  well  they   
interview the entire flight
crew  they   
interview the passengers 
they    hold public hearings 
hey  let s cut to the chase  what   
just tell me what i need to know  charlie 
the ntsb  go team  also collects
blood  hair  and skin samples
from the entire flight crew for the
purposes of a toxicological report 
okay    when do they want to do that 
they ve already done that 
in the hospital 
that s the first thing they do 
you don t remember having your
blood drawn the night of the crash 
  no 
  no 
they get the results of these   
these tests 
yeah  they do 
anything else for you  gentlemen 
yeah  uh    you have warm
cinnamon bums over there 
could you give me one of those  please 
in fact give me only two bums 
  yes sir  comin up 
  thank you  sweetie 
now   
an initial report shows that   
you had alcohol in your system   
uh  at a level of  2 4 
now   
in the good old u s  
a very one of the most lenient
drunk driving countries in the world 
you go to jail for driving
with anything above  0 8 
and by driving  i mean a car 
thank you 
well   
so that was    don t mean anything 
a couple of beers the
night before the flight 
would that make the tail
of the plane explode

you know  i need a lawyer  charlie 
  hugh is your lawyer 
  i need a bigger lawyer 
i need a layer that understands that
someone put me on a broken plane 
without me up there  there
would be a 102 funerals  not six

i ts not gonna be me  i promise you that 
as long as they re writing checks 
tell them they write one for me too 
because someone put me in a broken plane 
i d love a check  charlie 
this toxicology report states
that you were drunk 
and high on cocaine 
felony s punishable by up
to 12 years in prison 
and if it is proven that your intoxication
was the cause of the death
of four passengers  now we re gonna
look at four counts of manslaughter 
that could be life in prison

is that your reading of it 
absolutely  however  remember
every situation is different 
and the actions of the pilots
of southjet 2 2 7
will be heavily scrutinized 
are you suggesting that there may
be more to this that leans behind 
they re all answers  we don t have all of
the answers  we have a lot of questions 
we re gonna have to wait until
some of those answers come in before   
the next morning   
they re not gonna shot me

listen  i    i thought we d take a ride 
there s some i need to show you 
i m good 
there it is 
you can see    on initial impact 
the left wing hit the ground 
i think if it would have
sheared off completely 
everybody would have walked
away from this plane 
wing snapped off and it jaw opened the   
engine cowling into the    rear fuselage 
yeah 
if you were sitting in the last
six or seven rows it was   
like being hit by a train 
who are they 
the john the baptist pentecoastal mission 
they helped pull survivors
out of the wreckage 
now they come out here every day 
and that is ellen block 
she is the head of the ntsb investigation 
she s the one that s gonna be
asking you the tough questions 
i night the night before the flight 
i drank that morning too 
i used cocaine to help
straighten myself up 
i know 
it s in the toxicology report 
and it s not the reason why this happened 
no  it s not 
listen 
clearly there was a mechanical
issue with the plane 
  clearly 
  yeah  but what you and i know   
this was an  act of god  
and i m gonna fight to get
the ntsb to add  act of god 
as one of the probable causes 
who s god would do this 
here s the deal  avington carr 
is the owner of the airline 
he s on our side 
he s got big friends in washington too 
he wants to have a sit down with us
tomorrow morning at ten o clock 
  really 
  yeah 
you can t drink  captain 
you re under the microscope right now 
you can t be seen buy a liquor 
that means no bars    no drugs 
  i understand  i won t drink 
i promise you 
  look  we can get you help   
  i don t need help 
i won t drink  i promise you 
i can stop  on my own 
  okay 
  okay 
  so ten o clock 
  ten o clock  i got it 
avington car 
i never wanted that fucking airline 
neither did my brother 
it was my father that wanted it 
i like baseball 
  oh  i like baseball 
  everyone likes to watch baseball 
everybody enjoys to like baseball 
  the whole country likes baseball 
  the whole country likes baseball 
  cut the crap 
so    what s the deal  lenny 
is your union gonna survive this one 
more importantly  how big a check
you think i m gonna have to write 
well  you had six fatalities
on board your aircraft 
no no  it s four  lenny 
the two crew members don t count 
i don t mean they don t count 
they don t get settlements
like the passengers 
yeah  that s a workman s comp claim 
part of the union contract 
they do dangerous job  they know it 
you re the lawyer for the pilots  union 
no sir  this is hugh lang  he s
the attorney we brought on
to handle the criminal side of
captain whitaker s situation 
yes  and what is mr  whitaker s situation 
ntsb is up my ass with a flashlight 
we had to give them access to everything 
everbody s curious about captain whitaker 
well i flew with him in the navy
and he is a great pilot 
huh 
is he a drunk 
he s a heavy drinker 
but maybe i should bring in him 
in a minute 
alright  so let s get down to it  lenny 
what does the union plan to do
about this blood test saying
whitaker was high on booze and coke 
this guy s a real peach 
i m gonna kill the toxicology report 
the testing was done incompetently 
the toxicology equipment they used
was last calibrated in june of 2009 
it s already 18 months past code 
their log that should clearly state
who labeled the blood vials and when 
is very incomplete  and they used a
preservative in the blood
that has been known to cause fermentation 
and in some cases register
higher in an alcohol test 
now  i have done all this  i ve
only been here a few days  so   
i wouldn t worry about it too much 
i can handle this 
i like this guy  lenny 
makes me wanna go out
sniff a few lines and fly a jet 
mr  carr 
we re gonna fight to push all the fault
on the manufacturer  jackson ridgefield 
and you think they re gonna just open
their check book and buy us all lunch 
good fucking luck 
what s my exposure jim 
well  the awards to the
families could kill the airline 
fuck the airline 
the insurance companies
can have the goddamm airline 
i just don t want them come
sniffing in my other pockets 
speaking for the pilots  union  sir 
we don t want to see your airline go away 
we enjoy the contract you have with us 
we gonna protect captain whitaker 
and in turn we gonna protect your airline 
does    whitaker know he s goin  to jail 
my client isn t goin  to jail  mr  carr 
oh  he s goin  to jail 
he belongs in jail 
bet your ass he s goin  to jail 
the only question is   
is he gonna die in jail 
you are wrong  mr  carr 
last time i checked  six counts
of manslaughter  it s life in prison 
life in prison   
what we in georgia call  all day long  
i hear you re some kind o  pilot

it was my mom that raised me 
she was incredible 
she held it together for so long 
i couldn t tell how sick she was 
we spent those last seven months
together like we were teenagers 
we traded stories about
boys and    whatever

my name s trevor 
you saved my mom 
  it s great to see you  whip 
  it s great to see you  whip

trevor

  margaret 
  you take care  okay  whip 
  you take care  okay  whip

you know  i m in
the middle of this  uh   
investigation  the ntsb
is investigating the crash 
yeah  i m gonna talk to  em next week 
yeah  well  i i 
i m a little nervous because   
i was out the night
before the crash  the diner 
yeah  with katerina 
right  and i had two glasses of wine 
and they re probably gonna ask you
about my condition that morning  or
whether you thought
i had anything to drink 
what 
i ve known you eleven years  whip 
right 
you want to tell me that you and trina went
to diner and you had two glasses of wine 
sounds like a nice restaurant 
now which one was it 
you have to say that it was
an ordinary day  margaret 
i mean  it was an ordinary day 
you know me  i was in shape to fly 
you have a problem saying that 
it s a lie  whip    it s a lie 
trina told me you two
hadn t been to sleep 
well  the    my lack of
sleep had nothing to do
with that plane falling apart  margaret 
i m just trying to get these things
straight  now you think any other pilot
could have landed that plane
and saved more lives 
i didn t say that  whip 
  alright  then   
  i can t imagine another pilot   
imagine your son trevor in this
church looking at you in that box 
or my son visiting me in prison 
and for the next forty years 
please  whip  enough 
enough  whip 
don t you think we ve all had enough 
i need this  margaret 
what d you want me to say 
i just   
it was an ordinary day 
the storm    after we took off   
was very severe 
but as far as the flight crew
is concerned  it was a   
a perfectly ordinary day 
you okay 
uh yeah  yeah 
so 
well  i got through the first day 
they didn t fire me 
so   
  then 
and they need someone to work
the night shift  and they asked me 
it s time and a half so   
i got a vest   
and a    well  name tag 
i got you something 
  yeah

  it is a p 51 mustang 
  it is a p 51 mustang 
  i know it s a p 51 
  your daddy fly one of these 
  your daddy fly one of these 
  yes  he did 
it cause for celebration 
oh well  i promised sheila that
i d go to this aa meeting now

yeah 
yeah sure  why not 
you know  you can come with me

me behind the dumpster  i m   
i m wearing nothing but
my girlfriend s panties 
i got vomitin  on the
front of my chest 
and i say to him 
 uh    i might have had two beers

 two beer barry  
i m getting the  uh    the
stink eye from ed over here 
have i gone off format 
my name is barry and i m an alcoholic 
hi barry 
are there any other alcoholics present 
i always love a meeting where
we all have to identify the tab 
because it forces me to be
honest about who i really am 
and i never told the truth out there 
obviously i lied about everything 
i was told in these rooms that
i was never sober if i kept lying 
but that s what i was best at 
if i knew anything in this
world  it was how to lie 
especially about my drinking 
but   
whatever  i would lie about
the name of my dog 
i d lie about the color of my
own hair right to your face 
my whole life just became    a series
of lies  strung together by me 
i gotta go 
sure 
oh yeah  sheila  she can
give me a ride  does she 
i m sheila 
i ve been speaking to some people who
are very close to the ntsb investigation 
and they are confident they will
soon be able to determine exactly
what brought this plane down 
i m sure they will  sir 
well  ken and vicki evans 
thank you very much 
thank you sir  god bless you 
how you feeling  ken 
i m happy to be alive 
blessed    to be alive 
i m captain whitaker  i was

so  uh   
how long have you been out of the   
  out of the coma 
  yeah 
two days 
well  uh  look  i don t wanna   
disrupt your whole day 
god knows you ve been   
swamped by interviews  and   
you looked brillant on the cnn 
by the way 
both my legs are crushed 
my pelvis is snapped 
i ll probably never walk again 
al least not without a walker or braces 
i ll certainly never fly again 
i m very sorry  ken 
that plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit 
you reeked like gin or somethin  
i called vicki from the plane
before we took off 
that s when the rain kicked up 
well  i don t know how much
you remember  but   
that plane   
it started falling apart  ken 
i remember everything until the crash 
i know what went wrong 
what are you trying to say  ken 
what do we talk 
i do not know  captain whitaker 
what are we talking about 
i m just trying to get a sense from you   
about what you thought caused the crash 
was it the fact that you got on the
plane still drunk from the night before 
the ntsb is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me   
about the events on that flight 
do you think you    be alive
if i wasn t flying that plane 
no 
we d all be dead 
but you gonna argue with me
that your physical state was tip top 
wait 
sit   
please 
i never shared my opinion
about your physical state   
the morning of the flight 
i never said a word 
that crash was pre ordained 
i prayed on it  captain 
vicky and i both prayed on it 
there s only one judge  sir 
praise jesus 
and he s got a higher plan for you 
this event    although it s
tragic in his loss of life   
it s also a celebration of life 
nothing happens in the kingdom
of the lord by mistake  sir 
praise jesus 
captain   
will you pray with us 
jesus  our savior  we thank you
for blessing captain whitaker 
for guiding his hand
on that fateful morning

hello 
aah  there s our man 
hey 
captain whitaker 
let me be the first
to say congratulations 
it s a good day  we ve won 
yeah  this is what we call
in my profession a  walk over  
yeah  they sheduled the
hearing  it s ten days away 
they can be tough  but
you just got to be sharp 
stay focused  answer
the questions correctly 
that s right  then we re good 
right  i successfully
had an  act of god 
added to the ntsb s list
of probable causes 
we ve shifted suspicion away from you 
it s no longer a question of your
condition  but the condition of the plane 
that s what i ve been
trying to tell everybody 
broken plane 
that s right 
about the    the toxocologiy report 
oh  i killed that 
there is no physical proof that
you were intoxicated on that plane 
and no eyewitnesses 
why we re here 
we re good  
uh    because there is a   
a small problem 
because of the turbulence 
there was no drink service on the flight 
but they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash 
yeah    uhm   
and there s no physical
evidence on the bottles 
no dna  no fingerprints to link
them to anyone  but
they were uncapped and empty 
and the only people who would
have had access to those bottles
would be the flight crew 
now margaret evans and camelia satou 
they all had clean tox reports 
so that only leaves you 
  and  uh   
  trina marquez 
right  trina marquez 
okay 
okay  i see where we re going here 
that s funny tough  you know 
they only found two bottles 
  why s that

one s missing 
you know  when i first met you 
i couldn t believe what a drunk
arrogant scumbag you were

but i did the research  captain whitaker 
i heard the expert analyzes
and i got to tell you 
i m in awe of what you did 
the faa and the ntsb took ten pilots 
placed them in simulators 
recreated the events that led to
this plane falling out of the sky 
do you know how many of them
were able to safely land the planes 
not one 
every pilot crashed the aircraft 
killed everybody on board 
you re the only one who could do it 
great

those are difficult images to watch 
for the record  i m ellen block 
hearing officer for this hearing 
captain whitaker  good morning 
morning 
morning 
what that video captures is that the
aircraft was in a relatively stable glide
just prior to the moment of impact 
however  according to the data we
retreived from the cockpit data recorders 
at exactly 9 34  after flying
27 minutes without incident 
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute
in what is considered a
 full pitch nose down  attitude 
then  at 9 42  according
to the data recorders 
a decision was made to
invert the aircraft 
the ntsb has created animated simulation
that i would like to play at this point 
  we gonna roll it  okay 
  we gonna roll it  okay 
  what do you mean  roll it 
we gotta do something to stop this dive 
margaret  what s your son s name 
trevor 
  say  i love you  trevor  
  say  i love you  trevor  
  what 
  black box  say  i love you trevor  
  black box  say  i love you trevor  
   i love you trevor  
you be a good boy 
mommy loves you 
okay  here we go  i ve got control 
oh good lord 
jesus 
  flaps out 
  flaps out 
  speed brakes 
  speed brakes 
margaret 
power 
  gear up 
  gear up 
oh  lord jesus  we re inverted 
good flying lesson    we re leve   
   maintain alt    like this 
atlan    2 2 7    we are inverted 
i    we are    verted 
southj    2    7    did you say inverted 
that audio is tragic and compelling 
i chose to play that part
of the cockpit recording
to highlight a key moment
onboard flight 2 2 7 
wherein you say  we re gonna roll it 
here we go  i ve got control  
you made a very conscious
decision to invert the aircraft
to roll the plane upside down 
is that correct 
i m not sure if it was
conscious  but uh   
it was more like instinct 
what led to that decision 
i don t recall 
let me quote from an
investigative summary
 from 9 34 until 9 42
the events on the aircraft are  
again i quote   bold and remarkable  
 by inverting the plane  captain
whitaker arrested the descent 
and allowed the aircraft to level off 
enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas 
and allowing him to execute
a forced landing in an open field 
i heard a loud metallic bang 
we pitched nose down 
no control 
yes  first officer evans
testimony confirms the same 
i want to show you something 
nothing s happening  uh   
its remote control isn t working 
apologies  i can do this manually 
this is the jackscrew on the
tail assembly that articulates
the horizontal stabilizer   
also known as the elevator 
as you can see  the threads on
this screw are almost entirely gone 
this part was suggested as a maintenance
replacement in january of 2011 
it was never replaced 
it had an additional 1200 hours
of flight on it  it finally failed 
our investigators have concluded
that the jackscrew snapped
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position 
locking the elevator in a down position
which forced the plane into a dive 
the loss of the elevator was 
and i quote our report 
 a catastrophic event  from
which recovery was improbable
and stable flight  impossible  
mr  whitaker   
i want to talk about the days leading
and the hours leading up to the accident 
but before i do  i want to
remind you that you are under oath 
and that any testimony you ll give here
today will be considered admissable
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings 
do you understand what that means 
captain whitaker  for the record
i need you to verbalize your answer 
uh  i m sorry 
yes  i understand 
on the three days leading up
to the accident  tuesday  october 11th 
wednesday  october 12th
or thursday  october 13th 
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements 
no  i did not 
on the morning of the accident 
friday  october 14th 
did you consume any alcohol 
or ingest any chemicals or drugs
that may have impaired your
ability to perform your job 
no  i did not 
mr  whitaker  do you now or
have you ever had a problem
with alcohol dependency 
alcoholism or drug addiction 
no 
okay  mr  whitaker  we re about done 
due to the severe turbulence in the
early part of the flight  you asked
the flight crew to suspend the beverage
service on the plane  is that correct 
yes  that s correct  i suspended
the drink service on the plane 
are you aware that our investigators
found two single service vodka bottles
in the galley trash bin 
yeah  i m aware of that 
there were five crew members on board
that who would have had access
to the beverage trolley 
less than an hour after the accident 
blood was taken from each
of these crew members  yourself 
first officer evans  flight
attendant margaret thomason   
and posthumously from camelia
satou  and katerina marquez 
toxicology analysis was performed and   
three of these tests came back negative 
one was disqualified for
technical reasons  and one   
tested positive for alcohol 
it registered a  17 blood alcohol level 
are you aware of that 
yeah  i m aware of it now 
miss marquez was not only a colleague 
but you knew her outside of work 
is that correct 
outside of work   
no  not really 
did you know miss marquez
had a drinking problem 
no  i did not 
did you ever see her drink to excess 
no  i did not 
were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction 
the last time was 16 months ago
and paid for by southjet airlines 
no  i did not 
is it your opinion    that katerina
marquez    drank on that flight 
could you repeat the question 
is it your opinion that katerina
marquez drank on that flight 
i m sorry  my what 
your opinion  captain 
since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report
that is admissable in this hearing  and
she in fact tested positive for alcohol 
is it your opinion that katerina marquez
drank those 2 bottles
of vodka on the plane 
i m sorry mr  whitaker  i couldn t
hear you  what did you say 
i said   god  help me  
yes  well  however  is it your opinion 
it s my opinion   
trina did not   
drink that vodka 
excuse me  mr  whitaker 
she saved the boy s life  that s 
could you speak louder  captain whitaker 
trina marquez did not drink the vodka 
because i drank the vodka 
objection 
please be seated sir  this 
sir 
  i drank the vodka bottles 
  i drank the vodka bottles 
  did you hear what i said  i object 
please be seated sir 
this is not a court room 
well  i object anyway 
i drank the vodka bottles on the plane 
captain whitaker  on the three nights
before the accident  october 11 
october 11  october 12 and 13th
and 14th  i was intoxicated 
i drank all of those days  i drank   
in excess 
  on the morning of the accident 
  i was drunk 
i m drunk now 
i m drunk right now   
miss block   
because i m an alcoholic 
that was it 
i was finished 
i was done 
it was as if i had reached
my life long limit    for lies 
i could not tell one more lie 
and maybe i m a sucker 
because if i had told just one more lie 
i could have walked away
from all that mess   
kept my wings  kept my
false sense of pride   
and most importantly  i could have avoided
being locked up in here with all of you 
nice folks for the last 13 months 
but i m here 
and i ll be here for at least the   
next four or five years 
and that s fair 
i betrayed the public trust  i did 
that s how the judge explained it to me 
i had betrayed the public trust 
the faa  they took away
my pilot s license 
and that s fair 
my chances of ever flying
again are slim to none 
and i accept that 
i got a lot of time to think
about it  the all of it 
i m    doing some writing 
i wrote letters to each of the
families that had lost loved ones  and   
some of  em were able
to hear my apology   
some of  em never will 
i also apologized to   
all the people that tried to help me   
along the way  but i   
couldn t or wouldn t listen 
people like my wife   
my ex wife   
my son 
and again like i said  you know 
some of them will   
never forgive me  some of them will   
but at least i m sober 
i thank god for that 
i m grateful for that 
and this is gonna sound really stupid
coming from a man who s
locked up in prison   
but for the first time in my life   
i m free
