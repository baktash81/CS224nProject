no im fine with coffee thank you
so len caldwell really wanted
to get here this morning
lens the president of the pilots union
he wanted to be here to
meet with us and you
but they needed him at the crash site
so as you know when a plane goes down
the ntsb sends a go team
to the crash site immediately
they find the flight data recorders
they did its perfectly intact
oh great then that solves everything
so why do we need a lawyer from chicago
well hugh specializes
in criminal negligence
criminal negligence
hmmhmm
death demands responsibility
six dead on that plane
someone has to pay
yeah but thats a plane
that fell apart at
think it fell apart at 30 thousand feet
and the airline will try to
prove equipment failure
which is gonna make the manufacturer
responsible the manufacturer in turn
is gonna try and prove poor maintenance
of the equipment by the airline
or pilot error
i flew the plane inverted
that means upside down hugh
you get the picture a hundred people
upside down 500 feet off the ground
you have any idea what thats like
i do i uh heard the
black box recordings last night
oh you heard so youre a pilot
no no
then you know what the fuck
youre talking about do you
hughs on our team whip
is he
yeah he is
he didn act like he gonna
obviously
have to imagine me questions
well he is yeah but
like a fucking pilot
listen to me
and that he knows something
its the ntsbs ball game
they run the investigation and
they will ultimately rule on the cause
and thats why we need him
well they
interview the entire flight
crew they
interview the passengers
they hold public hearings
hey lets cut to the chase what
just tell me what i need to know charlie
the ntsb goteam also collects
blood hair and skin samples
from the entire flight crew for the
purposes of a toxicological report
okay when do they want to do that
theyve already done that
in the hospital
thats the first thing they do
you dont remember having your
blood drawn the night of the crash

you gonna shoot me
or can i come inside
yeah come on inside i shoot you inside
listen i i thought wed take a ride
theres some i need to show you
im good
there it is
you can see on initial impact
the left wing hit the ground
i think if it would have
sheared off completely
everybody would have walked
away from this plane
wing snapped off and it jaw opened the
engine cowling into the rear fuselage
yeah
if you were sitting in the last
six or seven rows it was
like being hit by a train
who are they
the john the baptist pentecoastal mission
they helped pull survivors
out of the wreckage
now they come out here every day
and that is ellen block
she is the head of the ntsb investigation
shes the one thats gonna be
asking you the tough questions
i night the night before the flight
i drank that morning too
i used cocaine to help
straighten myself up
i know
its in the toxicology report
and its not the reason why this happened
no its not
listen
clearly there was a mechanical
issue with the plane
clearly
yeah but what you and i know
this was an act of god
and im gonna fight to get
the ntsb to add act of god
as one of the probable causes
whos god would do this
heres the deal avington carr
is the owner of the airline
hes on our side
hes got big friends in washington too
he wants to have a sit down with us
tomorrow morning at ten oclock
really
yeah
you cant drink captain
youre under the microscope right now
you cant be seen buy a liquor
that means no bars no drugs
i understand i wont drink
i promise you
look we can get you help
i dont need help
i wont drink i promise you
i can stop on my own
okay
okay
so ten oclock
ten oclock i got it
avington car
i never wanted that fucking airline
neither did my brother
it was my father that wanted it
i like baseball
oh i like baseball
everyone likes to watch baseball
everybody enjoys to like baseball
the whole country likes baseball
the whole country likes baseball
cut the crap
so whats the deal lenny
is your union gonna survive this one
more importantly how big a check
you think im gonna have to write
well you had six fatalities
on board your aircraft
no no its four lenny
the two crew members dont count
i dont mean they dont count
they dont get settlements
like the passengers
yeah thats a workmans comp claim
part of the union contract
they do dangerous job they know it
youre the lawyer for the pilots union
no sir this is hugh lang hes
the attorney we brought on
to handle the criminal side of
captain whitakers situation
yes and what is mr whitakers situation
ntsb is up my ass with a flashlight
we had to give them access to everything
everbodys curious about captain whitaker
well i flew with him in the navy
and he is a great pilot
huh
is he a drunk
hes a heavy drinker
but maybe i should bring in him
in a minute
alright so lets get down to it lenny
what does the union plan to do
about this blood test saying
whitaker was high on booze and coke
this guys a real peach
im gonna kill the toxicology report
the testing was done incompetently
the toxicology equipment they used
was last calibrated in june of 2009
its already 18 months past code
their log that should clearly state
who labeled the blood vials and when
is very incomplete and they used a
preservative in the blood
that has been known to cause fermentation
and in some cases register
higher in an alcohol test
now i have done all this ive
only been here a few days so
i wouldnt worry about it too much
i can handle this
i like this guy lenny
makes me wanna go out
sniff a few lines and fly a jet
mr carr
were gonna fight to push all the fault
on the manufacturer jackson ridgefield
and you think theyre gonna just open
their check book and buy us all lunch
good fucking luck
whats my exposure jim
well the awards to the
families could kill the airline
fuck the airline
the insurance companies
can have the goddamm airline
i just dont want them come
sniffing in my other pockets
speaking for the pilots union sir
we dont want to see your airline go away
we enjoy the contract you have with us
we gonna protect captain whitaker
and in turn we gonna protect your airline
does whitaker know hes goin to jail
my client isnt goin to jail mr carr
oh hes goin to jail
he belongs in jail
bet your ass hes goin to jail
the only question is
is he gonna die in jail
you are wrong mr carr
last time i checked six counts
of manslaughter its life in prison
life in prison
what we in georgia call all day long
i hear youre some kind o pilot
theeere she is there she is
back to the meet
had a nice meeting
i know its okay uh

dad was a pilot he was a
332nd airbone he was a
tuskee he built that
landing strip out there
crop dustin epa shut him down he
traded the crop duster for
that old cesna sittin
out there in the barn
he flew that damn thing
all over the place
he died i got divorced and
been trying to sell the place ever since
what about your mom
dead
you what about your dad
well im pretty sure he
lives in colorado
yeah
no relationship
it was my mom that raised me
she was incredible
she held it together for so long
i couldnt tell how sick she was
we spent those last seven months
together like we were teenagers
we traded stories about
boys and whatever
oh she loved me
my names trevor
you saved my mom
its great to see you whip
its great to see you whip
its good to see you too
the service was so nice
i mean all those people
who wanted to say goodbye
and trina looked so beautiful in there
dont you think you
i mean like she was gonna
wake up and smile
i didnt go in margaret
i i just couldnt
trevor
find daddy baby
hes over there with mr benton
you really should come
to the counseling group
the union has great
people for us to talk to
i cant
really i
i will
yeah well
margaret
you take care okay whip
you take care okay whip
okay
listen margaret i have a
you know im in
the middle of this uh
investigation the ntsb
is investigating the crash
yeah im gonna talk to em next week
yeah well ii
im a little nervous because
i was out the night
before the crash the diner
yeah with katerina
right and i had two glasses of wine
and theyre probably gonna ask you
about my condition that morning or
whether you thought
i had anything to drink
what
ive known you eleven years whip
right
you want to tell me that you and trina went
to diner and you had two glasses of wine
sounds like a nice restaurant
now which one was it
you have to say that it was
an ordinary day margaret
i mean it was an ordinary day
you know me i was in shape to fly
you have a problem saying that
its a lie whip its a lie
trina told me you two
hadnt been to sleep
well the my lack of
sleep had nothing to do
with that plane falling apart margaret
im just trying to get these things
straight now you think any other pilot
could have landed that plane
and saved more lives
i didnt say that whip
alright then
i cant imagine another pilot
imagine your son trevor in this
church looking at you in that box
or my son visiting me in prison
and for the next forty years
please whip enough
enough whip
dont you think weve all had enough
i need this margaret
what dyou want me to say
i just
it was an ordinary day
the storm after we took off
was very severe
but as far as the flight crew
is concerned it was a
a perfectly ordinary day
you okay
uh yeah yeah
so
well i got through the first day
they didnt fire me
so
then
and they need someone to work
the night shift and they asked me
its time and a half so
i got a vest
and a well name tag
i got you something
yeah
yeah
thank you
it is a p51 mustang
it is a p51 mustang

your daddy fly one of these
your daddy fly one of these

it cause for celebration
oh well i promised sheila that
id go to this aa meeting now
shes my sponsor the one
thats been helping me
can we celebrate tomorrow night
yeah
yeah sure why not
you know you can come with me
to the meeting
its an open meeting
meaning that anyone can come
even you
so the cops got a flashlight on
me behind the dumpster im
im wearing nothing but
my girlfriends panties
i got vomitin on the
front of my chest
and i say to him
uh i might have had two beers
so thats why i get the nickname
twobeer barry
im getting the uh the
stink eye from ed over here
have i gone off format
my name is barry and im an alcoholic
hi barry
are there any other alcoholics present
i always love a meeting where
we all have to identify the tab
because it forces me to be
honest about who i really am
and i never told the truth out there
obviously i lied about everything
i was told in these rooms that
i was never sober if i kept lying
but thats what i was best at
if i knew anything in this
world it was how to lie
especially about my drinking
but
whatever i would lie about
the name of my dog
id lie about the color of my
own hair right to your face
my whole life just became a series
of lies strung together by me
i gotta go
sure
oh yeah sheila she can
give me a ride does she
im sheila
ive been speaking to some people who
are very close to the ntsb investigation
and they are confident they will
soon be able to determine exactly
what brought this plane down
im sure they will sir
well ken and vicki evans
thank you very much
thank you sir god bless you
how you feeling ken
im happy to be alive
blessed to be alive

my pelvis is snapped
ill probably never walk again

that plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit
you reeked like gin or somethin
i called vicki from the plane
before we took off
thats when the rain kicked up
well i dont know how much
you remember but
that plane
it started falling apart ken
i remember everything until the crash
i know what went wrong
what are you trying to say ken
what do we talk
i do not know captain whitaker
what are we talking about
im just trying to get a sense from you
about what you thought caused the crash
was it the fact that you got on the
plane still drunk from the night before
the ntsb is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me
about the events on that flight
do you think you be alive
if i wasnt flying that plane
no
wed all be dead
but you gonna argue with me
that your physical state was tiptop
wait

please
i never shared my opinion
about your physical state
the morning of the flight
i never said a word
that crash was preordained
i prayed on it captain
vicky and i both prayed on it
theres only one judge sir
praise jesus
and hes got a higher plan for you
this event although its
tragic in his loss of life

in my profession a walkover
yeah they sheduled the
hearing its ten days away
they can be tough but
you just got to be sharp
stay focused answer
the questions correctly
thats right then were good
right i successfully
had an act of god
added to the ntsbs list
of probable causes
weve shifted suspicion away from you
its no longer a question of your
condition but the condition of the plane
thats what ive been
trying to tell everybody
broken plane
thats right
about the the toxocologiy report
oh i killed that
there is no physical proof that
you were intoxicated on that plane
and no eyewitnesses
why were here
were good
uh because there is a
a small problem
because of the turbulence
there was no drink service on the flight
but they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash
yeah uhm
and theres no physical
evidence on the bottles
no dna no fingerprints to link
them to anyone but
they were uncapped and empty
and the only people who would
have had access to those bottles
would be the flight crew
now margaret evans and camelia satou
they all had clean tox reports
so that only leaves you
and uh
trina marquez
right trina marquez
okay
okay i see where were going here
thats funny tough you know

recreated the events that led to
this plane falling out of the sky

those are difficult images to watch
for the record im ellen block
hearing officer for this hearing
captain whitaker good morning
morning
morning
what that video captures is that the
aircraft was in a relatively stable glide
just prior to the moment of impact
however according to the data we
retreived from the cockpit data recorders
at exactly 934 after flying
27 minutes without incident
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute
in what is considered a
full pitch nose down attitude
then at 942 according
to the data recorders
a decision was made to
invert the aircraft
the ntsb has created animated simulation
that i would like to play at this point
we gonna roll it okay
we gonna roll it okay
what do you mean roll it
we gotta do something to stop this dive
margaret whats your sons name

margaret
power
gear up
gear up
oh lord jesus were inverted
good flying lesson were leve
maintain alt like this
atlan 227 we are inverted
i we are verted
southj 2 7 did you say inverted
that audio is tragic and compelling
i chose to play that part
of the cockpit recording
to highlight a key moment
onboard flight 227
wherein you say were gonna roll it
here we go ive got control
you made a very conscious
decision to invert the aircraft
to roll the plane upside down
is that correct
im not sure if it was
conscious but uh
it was more like instinct
what led to that decision
i dont recall
let me quote from an
investigative summary
from 934 until 942
the events on the aircraft are
again i quote bold and remarkable
by inverting the plane captain
whitaker arrested the descent
and allowed the aircraft to level off
enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas
and allowing him to execute
a forced landing in an open field
i heard a loud metallic bang
we pitched nose down
no control
yes first officer evans
testimony confirms the same
i want to show you something
nothings happening uh
its remote control isnt working
apologies i can do this manually
this is the jackscrew on the
tail assembly that articulates
the horizontal stabilizer
also known as the elevator
as you can see the threads on
this screw are almost entirely gone
this part was suggested as a maintenance
replacement in january of 2011
it was never replaced
it had an additional 1200 hours
of flight on it it finally failed
our investigators have concluded
that the jackscrew snapped
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position
locking the elevator in a down position
which forced the plane into a dive
the loss of the elevator was
and i quote our report
a catastrophic event from
which recovery was improbable
and stable flight impossible
mr whitaker
i want to talk about the days leading
and the hours leading up to the accident
but before i do i want to
remind you that you are under oath
and that any testimony youll give here
today will be considered admissable
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings
do you understand what that means
captain whitaker for the record
i need you to verbalize your answer
uh im sorry
yes i understand
on the three days leading up
to the accident tuesday october 11th
wednesday october 12th
or thursday october 13th
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements
no i did not
on the morning of the accident
friday october 14th
did you consume any alcohol
or ingest any chemicals or drugs
that may have impaired your
ability to perform your job
no i did not
mr whitaker do you now or
have you ever had a problem
with alcohol dependency
alcoholism or drug addiction
no
okay mr whitaker were about done
due to the severe turbulence in the
early part of the flight you asked
the flight crew to suspend the beverage
service on the plane is that correct
yes thats correct i suspended
the drink service on the plane
are you aware that our investigators
found two singleservice vodka bottles
in the galley trash bin
yeah im aware of that
there were five crew members on board
that who would have had access
to the beverage trolley
less than an hour after the accident
blood was taken from each
of these crew members yourself
first officer evans flight
attendant margaret thomason
and posthumously from camelia
satou and katerina marquez
toxicology analysis was performed and
three of these tests came back negative
one was disqualified for
technical reasons and one
tested positive for alcohol
it registered a 17 blood alcohol level
are you aware of that
yeah im aware of it now
miss marquez was not only a colleague
but you knew her outside of work
is that correct
outside of work
no not really
did you know miss marquez
had a drinking problem
no i did not
did you ever see her drink to excess
no i did not
were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction
the last time was 16 months ago
and paid for by southjet airlines
no i did not
is it your opinion that katerina
marquez drank on that flight
could you repeat the question
is it your opinion that katerina
marquez drank on that flight
im sorry my what
your opinion captain
since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report
that is admissable in this hearing and
she in fact tested positive for alcohol
is it your opinion that katerina marquez
drank those 2 bottles
of vodka on the plane
im sorry mr whitaker i couldnt
hear you what did you say
i said god help me
yes well however is it your opinion
its my opinion
trina did not
drink that vodka
excuse me mr whitaker
she saved the boys life thats
could you speak louder captain whitaker
trina marquez did not drink the vodka
because i drank the vodka
objection
please be seated sir this
sir
i drank the vodka bottles
i drank the vodka bottles
did you hear what i said i object
please be seated sir
this is not a court room
well i object anyway
i drank the vodka bottles on the plane
captain whitaker on the three nights
before the accident october 11
october 11 october 12 and 13th
and 14th i was intoxicated
i drank all of those days i drank
in excess
on the morning of the accident
i was drunk
im drunk now
im drunk right now
miss block
because im an alcoholic
that was it
i was finished
i was done
it was as if i had reached
my life long limit for lies
i could not tell one more lie
and maybe im a sucker
because if i had told just one more lie
i could have walked away
from all that mess
kept my wings kept my
false sense of pride
and most importantly i could have avoided
being locked up in here with all of you
nice folks for the last 13 months
but im here
and ill be here for at least the
next four or five years
and thats fair
i betrayed the public trust i did
thats how the judge explained it to me
i had betrayed the public trust
the faa they took away
my pilots license
and thats fair
my chances of ever flying
again are slim to none
and i accept that
i got a lot of time to think
about it the all of it
im doing some writing
i wrote letters to each of the
families that had lost loved ones and
some of em were able
to hear my apology
some of em never will
i also apologized to
all the people that tried to help me
along the way but i
couldnt or wouldnt listen
people like my wife
my exwife
my son
and again like i said you know
some of them will
never forgive me some of them will
but at least im sober
i thank god for that
im grateful for that
and this is gonna sound really stupid
coming from a man whos
locked up in prison
but for the first time in my life
im free
