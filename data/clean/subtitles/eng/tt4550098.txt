 a lot more dickoletage
 than what he has to offer 
 and as i can recall it 
 you were the one that told me

 it was as thin
 as coconut water 
 honey  that s
 a deal breaker for me 
 it was that thin 
 well  i see we re settling
 for less nowadays

mrs  morrow

you can read it 
 dear susan  i ve written
a novel that will be
published in the spring 
 it s different from
the kind of things
that i was writing
 when we were together  
go ahead 
 in the end you left me
with the inspiration
that i needed
 to write from the heart 
 i wanted you to be
the first to read it 
so i m sending along a proof 
 i will be in la until
wednesday on business
 and it would be good
to see you after so long 
 my cell number
and email address
are below  edward  
thanks 
morning 
good morning 
what s that 
it s a manuscript
edward sent me 
he wrote a novel 
edward who 
edward  my first husband 
you remember him 
i didn t know he could write 
yes  you did 
he was writing a novel
when you and i got together 
you just don t remember 
have you guys even talked
in 20 years 
19 
no  i tried calling him
a couple of years back 
but he hung up on me 
i think he s teaching english
at some prep school in dallas 
it s sad  really 
he never remarried 
where were you
last night  you didn t
come by the gallery 
i m sorry  really  i   
by the time i left
the office  i was late
for my dinner and   
it would have
taken you 15 minutes 
fifteen minutes  and it would
have meant a lot to me 
never mind 
you didn t come
to bed last night 
i didn t wanna wake you 
yeah 
well  i wasn t asleep 
i was too wound up
from the opening 
it went well  by the way 
apparently 
good 
yeah 
look  why don t you and i
go to the beach 
we can go tonight
and come back on monday 
maybe if we
just spent some time 
just the two of us 
why are you wearing
this blazer on a saturday 
because i gotta
go back to the office 
and then i gotta go
to the airport  and then
i gotta go back to new york 
you just came from there 
yes  i know 
but i have to go again
if i wanna get this deal done 
and i don t wanna have to sell
anything else 
shit 
it s okay 
you know 
the strange thing is is 
i don t really care
about all this art 
that doesn t sound like you 
i know  but it s true 
i care 
it pisses me off 
i know you do 
don t worry 
i can fill the walls
with some new la artists
and people will think
we re ahead of the curve
instead of going broke 
you won t have
to be embarrassed 
are things a little better 
he s just having a hard time
with his business right now 
carlos told me 
i m surprised  i thought
we were hiding it pretty well 
hutton would be very upset
to find out anybody knew 
he just hates not to win 
are you sleeping 
did you call my
psychopharmacologist 
did you call him 
you should call him 
because he s a genius 
i m worried
about you  seriously 
just look at me for a second 
look at me 
you scared me
the last time we talked 
i m fine 
i am fine  i am   
i am  i just can t believe
that i told you
all of those things 
i m just kind of
embarrassed  you know 
because what right
do i have to not be happy 
i have everything 
i feel ungrateful
not to be happy 
as much right
as anyone  susan 
as much right as anyone 
because it s all relative 
you re just awfully hard
on yourself 
how do you do it 
you mean with carlos 
i just    it s   
i m totally cool with it 
and having a gay husband
is not such a bad thing 
you know 
we re best friends 
we love each other completely 
i m certainly
the only woman in his life 
and that lasts
longer than lust  doesn t it 
it s forever  really 
hutton and i don t have that 
did you ever 
i think we just
want different things 
or i want different things 
do you still love him 
i m being summoned  pardon me 
he has to catch a plane 
i m gonna say goodbye 
i hope this deal
works out for you 
i really do 
i know you need it 
we need this 
no  you need this 
bye 
bye 
 so i said 
 well  my mother
always told me
 if you massage your pussy
with pam cooking spray
 a month before
the baby comes 
 you don t need
vaginal rejuvenation  
i ve gotta get some pam 
and she is going to get
a nomination this year 
a nomination  she s gonna win 
let s talk about your opening 
my favorite subject 
not mine 
the opening was
spectacular last night 
really 
that s what you thought 
what  you didn t 
no 
i thought the work
was incredibly strong 
so perfect with
all this junk culture
that we live in 
it s junk  it is junk 
total junk 
darling  you are
a big success 
no one really likes
what they do 
then why do we do it 
because we re driven 
maybe a bit insecure 
we get into things
when we re young
and because we think
they mean something 
and then
we find out that they don t 
oh  susan  enjoy
the absurdity of our world 
it s a lot less painful 
and believe me  our world
is a lot less painful
than the real world 
yeah  why are we driving
this old thing to marfa 
because i just had it
completely rebuilt 
it s a classic 
it has a terrible
sound system 
well  you re gonna have
to suffer through that

of boots  india

 edward  edward 
hi 
susan 
hi  god 
how are you 
it s good to see
someone i know 
it s good to see you 
you look beautiful  as always 
what are you doing
in new york city 
i m here for an interview
for a scholarship at columbia 
columbia 
i thought that you were at
the university of texas
becoming a great writer 
a great writer  i mean 
i don t    i don t think so 
well  i am   
but aren t you at yale
becoming a great artist 
graduated yale 
but i m at columbia
getting my master s degree 
oh  wow 
yeah  art history 
that s great 
yeah 
listen  do you know
anybody else in new york 
just you 
just me 
okay  well  would you like
to go to dinner 
absolutely 
okay 
okay  great  just let me   
just let me drop off
my packages at my apartment 
all right  do you want me
to grab them for you 
i can hold that 
yeah  great  thank you 
oh    i miss texas men 
you don t have blizzards
like this in texas 
no  you don t 
you know that you
were my first crush
when we were at hastings 
i only spent so much time
around your brother
just to be around you 
well  you were
his first crush 
what 
yeah 
well  i had no idea
cooper was gay 
i don t think
he knew back then 
but he was obsessed with you 
mmm 
wow 
yeah 
if i hadn t caught you
staring at me so much 
i would have thought
you were sleeping with him 
i  actually   
i feel terrible 
i haven t called him
in a few years 
i feel like
i ve been a bad friend 
i hope i didn t hurt him 
you re good  you know that 
no  you are  most guys
would have freaked out
if they found out
their best friend
was in love with them 
you re very sweet 
you should call him 
he would like that 
my parents have basically
disowned him 
they re not really
talking anymore 
why 
why  are you serious 
well  you know
my parents  right 
they re religious 
conservative  sexist  racist 
republican  materialistic 
narcissistic  racist 
i could keep going   
i m just wondering
what you really think  susan 
it s true  i know 
but they just see us
as a reflection of themselves 
so they can t accept cooper
for who he is 
i m not sure
how i m gonna fare 
aren t you being
a little hard on them 
no 
they have an antiquated idea
of how i should live my life 
especially my mother 
i understand 
i ve always loved your mom 
really 
oh  yeah 
she was great with me
when my dad died 
mmm 
you both have the same kind
of sadness in your eyes 
what 
you and your mother 
that is a weird thing
to say  edward 
oh  i m sorry 
i don t mean to offend you 
i just    she just
always seemed sad to me 
she has sad eyes 
and i ve thought that
since i was a little boy 
you have the same eyes 
they re beautiful 
just don t say
i m like my mom  okay 
i don t wanna be like her 
it s funny   cause
i always envied your family 
i felt like
such an impostor at school 
you did  i thought
i was the only one
who felt like that 
you 
yeah 
i was so busy
trying to be perfect and   
and you don t feel that way 
no 
that s exactly
what makes you so perfect 
you are gonna be
a great novelist 
 cause you have created
a fictitious character
in your head about   
no 
yes 
no 
yes 
no 
i don t believe that 
why d you give up
on becoming an artist 
because i m too cynical
to be an artist 
i think that to be
really  really good 
you have to come
from someplace inside
that i m just not sure i have 
you underestimate yourself 
do you know that 
edward  um 
will you come home with me 
well  that s a bit forward 
yeah 
it s not what i d expect
from a texas debutante 
well  you know
all debutantes
are sluts  so   
hmm 
hmm 
hmm 
and you were
my first crush too 
i know 
we got a report
from ozona 
someone else harassed
on the highway last night
just like you 
if you don t mind 
we could use
your fingerprints 
mine 
there s just a bunch of prints
on the trunk of the car 
it could help us
sort  em out 
there s something else 
yeah 
we have the cause of death 
your wife had
a fractured skull 
she was probably struck
with a hammer
or a baseball bat 
probably just once
or twice  so   
your daughter had
a much more difficult time 
she was suffocated 
she also had
a broken arm 
and they had
both been raped 
it turns out you were right
about that trailer  too 
how 
those fellas 
they took your folks
in there 
just like you thought 
how do you know that 
we found your wife s
fingerprints on the bedpost 
whose trailer is it 
it s clear 
guy doesn t even live here 
he s in el paso 
trailer s been broken into 
somebody s been living in it 
there s prints
all over the place 
we re gonna have to check  em
against the owner s 
see if we can
separate  em out 
right 
i m hopeful  though 
the owner hasn t been there
since last fall  so   
looks promising 
prom   
promising 
 why didn t
 you tell me this before 
 you re actually gonna
 leave new york 
move to austin and go
to the goddamn
university of texas 
why are you doing this 
i mean 
where is this gonna go 
what do you mean 
where is this going to go 
i m going to marry edward 
that s where this
is going to go 
this is a ridiculous
conversation 
you re too young
to get married 
really 
mom  last summer you tried
to convince me that i had
to marry bass 
that is different 
bass is your equal 
oh  my god 
did you just say that 
you really just said that 
that came out
of your mouth 
that s   
why do you always think
the worst of me 
that is not what i meant 
what i meant
is that you are very
strong willed 
and edward 
as sweet as he is 
he s too weak for you 
weak is not a word
that i would use
to describe edward 
sensitive is a word
that i would use 
which isn t a word i would use
to describe anyone else
in this family 
except maybe cooper 
don t bring cooper
into this 
sorry 
come on  susan 
i know you think
that we don t care
about the same things 
but you re wrong 
in a few years 
all these bourgeois things 
as you so like to call them 
are gonna be
very important to you 
and edward s not gonna be able
to give them to you 
he has no money 
he s not driven 
he s not ambitious 
and i can promise you 
if you marry edward 
your father s not gonna
give them to you either 
no  you re right 
he s not driven
the way that you
would like him to be 
but he is strong 
he s stronger than i am
in a lot of ways 
just    he just has
a different kind
of strength is all 
 a different kind
of strength  
and what kind
of strength is that 
he has the strength
to believe in himself
and believe in me 
susan 
keep seeing him
if you have to 
live with him 
i don t care 
but do not marry him 
i understand
what you see in edward 
i get it 
no 
no  wait  i do 
no  you don t 
no  you don t 
yes  i do 
he is a romantic 
but he is also
very fragile 
i saw that
when his father died 
don t   
don t do this 
you ll regret it 
and you ll only hurt edward
in the end 
the things you love
about him now are
the things you ll hate
in a few years 
you may not realize it 
but you and i
are a lot more alike
than you think 
no  you re wrong 
you and i are nothing alike 
really 
just wait 
we all eventually
turn into our mothers 
 yeah 
tony hastings 
yes  who is this 
roberto andes 
i ve sent you an email 
you get it 
yes 
well  you recognize the guy 
no 
 shit 
god damn it 
you sure 
yeah  the whole thing s
just a blur 
 well  his prints
 are all over your car 
they found  em
at the trailer too 
his name s steve adams 
 he s got a record
 in california 
 a stolen car 
acquittal on a rape charge 
i put out an apb on him 
 he s the only lead
 we got  tony 
and i sure as hell don t have
any other witnesses 
 you sure
 you don t recognize him 
no 
fuck  what s wrong
with you  man 
 don t you wanna put
 these guys away 
yeah  of course i do 
the whole thing
is just some   
just a blank 
i know it was him 
 well  that may be 
 but nobody s seen him
 around here lately 
 listen  i gotta be
 honest with you 
 right now
 it s not looking good 
 sometimes these cases
 go months or even years
 without a break 
 you need to prepare
 yourself for that 
 why are you
 so driven to write 
 i guess it s a way
 of keeping things alive 
 you know  saving things
 that will eventually die 
 and if i write
 it down  then 
 it ll last forever 
afternoon 
hey  there 
sorry i m late 
there was traffic
on the interstate 
that s all right 
you look different 
no beard 
you look   
you look different too 
yeah  so i ll tell you
what we got 
we had an attempted hold up
at the supermarket
in the mall last night
just before closing 
we caught one
of the guys 
one got killed
and one got away 
what do you 
what do you want me to do 
see if you recognize
the guy we caught 
you can look
at the dead one too 
although i don t really
think it s necessary 
we know who he is 
who 
steve adams 
the one you called turk
that i emailed you
about last year 
come on in 
are you afraid to look
this fella in the eye 
let him see you 
no 
that s good 
i think it will
help him talk 
that s him 
that guy on the left 
on the far left 
that s him 
no 
no  no  no  no 
no  hold up  son 
you ain t that lucky 
get over here 
this fella 
yes 
i see  right 
i don t think
he understands 
lou  lou  hey  you 
your name lou 
you know my name 
i told you 
yeah 
yeah  what s going on 
well  i guess i want you
to tell me if you ve ever
seen this man before 
think carefully 
you ever seen him 
no  i don t know him 
hmm 
who is he 
why don t you tell him  tony 
tell him who he is 
last summer  this man 
lou  and his friends 
they forced us off the road
on the interstate
and two of them
forced their way into my car
with my wife and my daughter 
and then this man   
this man  this man lou 
yes  lou  he made me
drive his car 
he took me to the middle
of the desert
and he left me there 
and later my wife
and daughter
were found dead
near the same place 
well  that ain t right 
what you got to say
about this man s
wife and daughter 
i don t know
nothing about that 
i ve never seen him
before in my life 
what you gonna tell me
about ray and turk 
who 
who 
what  are you an owl 
you an owl  lou 
i never heard of  em 
you never heard of  em 
no  sir 
hmm 
mmm hmm 
all right 
officer 
put him up 
are you sure
this is the man 
absolutely  yes 
you ll swear in a court of law
under penalty of perjury 
yes 
good 
well  we got lou 
i m gonna charge him
with murder 
what  do you have
enough evidence 
oh  you bet 
between you and the prints
in the car and the trailer 
what  he went back
to the trailer
after he left me 
yeah  looks like it 
uh  he probably just went back
to tell  em where you were 
that s why they came back
with the bodies 
they were 
they were gonna kill you 
you see  yeah 
i bet your friend ray s
the third fella
in the hold up 
what now 
well  you re gonna
wait for trial 
and i m gonna go find ray 
don t forget you have
a board meeting
at the museum at 3 00 
i m sorry  what was that 
you didn t sleep again 
did you 
you know me 
i never sleep 
my ex husband
used to call me
a nocturnal animal 
what ex husband 
i didn t know
you had an ex husband 
since when 
a couple of years
in graduate school 
it s weird 
i ve been thinking
about him a lot lately 
and then recently
he sent me this book
that he s written
and it s
violent and it s sad 
and he titled it
 nocturnal animals
and he dedicated it to me 
did you love him 
yeah  i loved him 
he was a writer and  uh 
i didn t have faith in him 
i panicked
and i did something
horrible to him 
something unforgivable 
really 
you left him 
i left him 
i left him in a brutal way 
for the handsome
and dashing hutton 
who is very handsome
and dashing 
   and dashing  yes 
do you ever feel like
your life has turned
into something
you never intended 
no 
of course not 
you just started
living your life 
you really didn t get
any sleep  did you 
no 
where did
this painting come from 
what do you mean 
where did it come from 
you bought it for us 
remember 
it was part of the series
like eight years ago 
it s great  isn t it 
yeah 
what is that 
oh  my god 
it s so cool 
it s this app
that lets me watch willow
while she s in her crib 
really  do you not
trust your nanny 
no  no  i do 
i just hate her  so   
and i would like
to be more involved
with willow
throughout the day  so   
look  there she is 
and the sound s incredible 
you can actually hear
her breathing 
and i can talk to her
if i want to 
i m sorry 
i m so sorry  i m   
are you okay 
yeah 
yeah  i just   
i thought i saw someone 
well  you did see someone 
that s willow
and she s in her crib 
she s sleeping 
i m really sorry
about your phone 
i can  um   
it s fine  a new one comes out
next week anyway  so   
thanks 
shall we 
they re all
waiting for us 
we re under
no contractual obligations 
which is good 
i know we all have different 
you know  opinions about this 
but as far as i m concerned   
anyways 
i think we should
cut her loose 
she isn t who she sold herself
to be when we hired her 
i disagree 
i think we should keep her
for now 
why is that 
because she s great
and we all like her 
she just needs our support
and a little bit of time 
that s all 
  but it s not working 
  we need to fire her 
there s an awesome candidate
that we could steal
from the hammer
if we move fast 
i agree with linda 
we hired her 
we should support her 
new doctor 
no  new haircut 
but  susan  you were the one
who brought it up last meeting
that you were
looking for a change 
i know  but now i think
we should keep her 
sometimes it s   
sometimes maybe
it s not such a good idea
to change things
quite so much 
i don t get it 
what are we doing here 
shit 
are you okay 
yeah  i m fine 
follow me 
that s ray marcus 
he s been named
as a frequent companion
of lou bates and steve adams 
part time electrician 
part time plumber 
hence the clever
toilet facilities 
he s not a bad match
to your description
and the fella at the hold up 
no fingerprints 
but we knew that before 
i wonder why there aren t
any fingerprints 
well  his hands
were probably on your wife 
his record s clean 
except for a rape charge
that got dropped 
i heard from this barman
at this place  line camp bar 
that ray lives here
with a girl named leila
but he also keeps another spot
to take girls
she don t know about 
probably your murder trailer
before it got notorious 
does he look like
he could be the guy 
yes  that s him 
good 
let s talk to him 
hey  ray 
what the fuck 
who the hell are you 
get off my property  man 
shit  i ll call you back

lou took me out into the brush
and kicked me out 
and you came back in my car

this entire conversation 
there  you clear 
mmm hmm

now  we re going
to a place you might remember 
and you can help yourself out
by telling me about it 
but if you don t remember 
tony does  all right 
hey  i m sorry
you lost your folks  man 
it s a shame 
but i didn t have
nothin  to do with it 
what s this place 
you know this place

you wanna get out  tony 
shall we have
a look inside  ray

come on 
let s take a look 
all right 
all right 
oh  you raped them
on the bed  i suppose 
i never raped nobody 
stop fucking around  ray 
we seen your record 
we know about
that girl in lubbock 
the charges were dropped 
i never raped nobody 
i wanna know  ray 
i wanna know the exact story 
what you did to them 
you ll have to ask
somebody else 
i wanna know what they said 
i wanna know what my wife said
and i wanna know
what my daughter said 
i wanna know
how you killed them 
and i wanna know if they knew
it was happening to them 
i wanna know what they felt 
i wanna know if they hurt 
answer me 
answer me 
answer me 
you fucking bastard 
is it better 
you re gonna take this
the wrong way  but  um 
i think that you
should write about something
other than yourself 
nobody writes about anything
but themselves 
i just  my mind started
to wander when
i was reading it 
and that s not good  right 
i don t know what to do 
maybe  you know 
maybe i don t have
a book in me 
maybe give yourself
some space 
just do something else 
can you not do that 
what 
because it   
that makes me feel like
you don t believe in me 
edward 
that s not what i said 
no  you didn t say that 
but you re saying it
with your face
and you re saying it
when you sigh 
whatever  you re saying it
when you say you want me
to go back to school 
well  yeah  i do want you
to go back to school 
i don t see
what s wrong with that 
i mean 
i m just being a realist 
i mean  you re gonna
work at a book store
and just write a novel 
like that s what
you wanna do
with your life 
i mean 
that s really romantic  but 
like  what  this is it 
this is it  this is what   
you sound like your mother 
well  you always said
that i reminded you
so much of her  so   
you know  this is exactly why
i don t wanna read your work
because you always get
so fucking defensive 
yeah  of course i m defensive 
do you know what it feels like
to put yourself out
on the line creatively
and then have someone
you love tell you that
they don t understand it 
no  i don t 
because i m not creative   
that s because
you choose not to be 
i don t wanna fight 
i m tired and i m edgy 
i ve been writing all night 
i just wanted you to like it 
all right 
thanks 
 i got some news
 you re not gonna like 
they re letting ray marcus go 
 what  what do you mean 
 they re letting him go 
the d a  says we don t have
enough hard evidence 
what we have
is circumstantial 
he needs corroboration 
i m real sorry  tony 
it s a goddamn shame 
at least you got to lay
a good belt on him 
 no  that s not enough 
 what else can we do 
i can think of something 
you d better get
here quick  though 
he ain t gonna
stick around for long 
 okay  all right 
 i m leaving now 
what 
i told you 
i got lung cancer 
it s metastasized 
but you smoke all the time 
yeah  well 
that s how it works 
what s the point
in quitting now 
i ll be dead in a year 
it s this fella named jenks 
he s the lawyer
the court appointed for ray 
he s a little smartass
from dallas 
he and the d a  made a deal
and ray got off  politics 
when did you tell me
you were sick 
see  they re trying
to force me out 
they already got another fella
lined up for the job 
i don t understand
what you re talking about 
they d drop a murder case
to do that 
oh  yeah 
give  em the reason 
ammunition 
they said my case
wasn t well prepared 
was a sloppy job  slapdash 
no evidence and evidence
improperly gathered 
won t stand up in court 
the d a  s too much
of a chickenshit
to take a case he might lose 
they re not dropping lou 
well  it s no fucking good
if we don t get ray 
good 
that s what i was
hoping you d say 
they want me to retire
and enjoy the benefits
of my cancer somewhere else 
fuck that 
you never told me
about the cancer 
the problem with ray
is his alibi 
you have a family 
ray claims he was with
that little   
bobby  bobby 
what 
do you have anyone
in your life 
no  no wife or   
i have a daughter in corpus 
has she been a help 
she doesn t know 
what can she do about it 
anyway  ray claims
he was with that little girl 
leila whatever her name is 
and she backs him up 
her aunt backs her up 
what are we gonna do 
it s a question
of how serious you are
about seeing justice done 
you get me 
i can t eat 
gonna throw up 
how are you gonna get
anything done
if you can t eat 
sometimes i can 
sometimes i can t 
this place is terrible 
i need you to eat something 
so let me ask you
a personal question 
off the record 
between you and me 
what do you want me to do
with ray marcus 
well  what can you do
with him 
anything you goddamn like 
but i thought
you said that   
listen 
i got nothin  to lose 
i m not gonna let
this asshole d a 
fuck up my last case 
i m also not gonna stand by
and watch a murderer go free 
i ve seen too many sick fucks
like ray marcus get off
over the years 
now  are you willing
to go outside
of strict procedure on this 
yes 
you sure 
yes 
andes here 
you re kidding 
all right  thanks 
ray just showed up
at line camp

that little idiot get nice

his ass and take him
to my camp

a little while
