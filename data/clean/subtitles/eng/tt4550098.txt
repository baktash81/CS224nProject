in the end you left me
with the inspiration
that i needed
to write from the heart
i wanted you to be
the first to read it
so im sending along a proof
i will be in la until
wednesday on business
and it would be good
to see you after so long
my cell number
and email address

thanks
morning
good morning
whats that
its a manuscript
edward sent me
he wrote a novel
edward who
edward my first husband
you remember him
i didnt know he could write
yes you did
he was writing a novel
when you and i got together
you just dont remember
have you guys even talked
in 20 years
no i tried calling him
a couple of years back
but he hung up on me
i think hes teaching english
at some prep school in dallas
its sad really
he never remarried
where were you
last night you didnt
come by the gallery
im sorry really i
by the time i left
the office i was late
for my dinner and
it would have
taken you 15 minutes
fifteen minutes and it would
have meant a lot to me
never mind
you didnt come
to bed last night
i didnt wanna wake you
yeah
well i wasnt asleep
i was too wound up
from the opening
it went well by the way
apparently
good
yeah
look why dont you and i
go to the beach
we can go tonight
and come back on monday
maybe if we
just spent some time
just the two of us
why are you wearing
this blazer on a saturday
because i gotta
go back to the office
and then i gotta go
to the airport and then
i gotta go back to new york
you just came from there
yes i know
but i have to go again
if i wanna get this deal done
and i dont wanna have to sell
anything else
shit
its okay
you know
the strange thing is is
i dont really care
about all this art
that doesnt sound like you
i know but its true
i care
it pisses me off
i know you do
dont worry
i can fill the walls
with some new la artists
and people will think
were ahead of the curve
instead of going broke
you wont have
to be embarrassed
are things a little better
hes just having a hard time
with his business right now
carlos told me
im surprised i thought
we were hiding it pretty well
hutton would be very upset
to find out anybody knew
he just hates not to win
are you sleeping
did you call my
psychopharmacologist
did you call him
you should call him
because hes a genius
im worried
about you seriously
just look at me for a second
look at me
you scared me
the last time we talked
im fine
i am fine i am
i am i just cant believe
that i told you
all of those things
im just kind of
embarrassed you know
because what right
do i have to not be happy
i have everything
i feel ungrateful
not to be happy
as much right
as anyone susan
as much right as anyone
because its all relative
youre just awfully hard
on yourself
how do you do it
you mean with carlos
i just its
im totally cool with it
and having a gay husband
is not such a bad thing
you know
were best friends
we love each other completely
im certainly
the only woman in his life
and that lasts
longer than lust doesnt it
its forever really
hutton and i dont have that
did you ever
i think we just
want different things
or i want different things
do you still love him
im being summoned pardon me
he has to catch a plane
im gonna say goodbye
i hope this deal
works out for you
i really do
i know you need it
we need this
no you need this
bye
bye
so i said
well my mother
always told me

with pam cooking spray
a month before
the baby comes
you dont need
vaginal rejuvenation
ive gotta get some pam

so perfect with
all this junk culture
that we live in
its junk it is junk
total junk
darling you are
a big success
no one really likes
what they do
then why do we do it
because were driven
maybe a bit insecure
we get into things
when were young
and because we think
they mean something
and then
we find out that they dont
oh susan enjoy
the absurdity of our world
its a lot less painful
and believe me our world
is a lot less painful
than the real world

hi
susan
hi god
how are you
its good to see
someone i know
its good to see you
you look beautiful as always
what are you doing
in new york city
im here for an interview
for a scholarship at columbia
columbia
i thought that you were at
the university of texas
becoming a great writer
a great writer i mean
i dont i dont think so
well i am
but arent you at yale
becoming a great artist
graduated yale
but im at columbia
getting my masters degree
oh wow
yeah art history
thats great
yeah
listen do you know
anybody else in new york
just you
just me
okay well would you like
to go to dinner
absolutely
okay
okay great just let me
just let me drop off
my packages at my apartment
all right do you want me
to grab them for you
i can hold that
yeah great thank you
oh i miss texas men
you dont have blizzards
like this in texas
no you dont
you know that you
were my first crush
when we were at hastings
i only spent so much time
around your brother
just to be around you
well you were
his first crush
what
yeah
well i had no idea
cooper was gay
i dont think
he knew back then
but he was obsessed with you
mmm
wow
yeah
if i hadnt caught you
staring at me so much
i would have thought
you were sleeping with him
i actually
i feel terrible
i havent called him
in a few years
i feel like
ive been a bad friend
i hope i didnt hurt him
youre good you know that
no you are most guys
would have freaked out
if they found out
their best friend
was in love with them
youre very sweet
you should call him
he would like that
my parents have basically
disowned him
theyre not really
talking anymore
why
why are you serious
well you know
my parents right
theyre religious
conservative sexist racist
republican materialistic
narcissistic racist
i could keep going
im just wondering
what you really think susan
its true i know
but they just see us
as a reflection of themselves
so they cant accept cooper
for who he is
im not sure
how im gonna fare
arent you being
a little hard on them
no
they have an antiquated idea
of how i should live my life
especially my mother
i understand
ive always loved your mom
really
oh yeah
she was great with me
when my dad died
mmm
you both have the same kind
of sadness in your eyes
what
you and your mother
that is a weird thing
to say edward
oh im sorry
i dont mean to offend you
i just she just
always seemed sad to me
she has sad eyes
and ive thought that
since i was a little boy
you have the same eyes
theyre beautiful
just dont say
im like my mom okay
i dont wanna be like her
its funny cause
i always envied your family
i felt like
such an impostor at school
you did i thought
i was the only one
who felt like that
you
yeah
i was so busy
trying to be perfect and
and you dont feel that way
no
thats exactly
what makes you so perfect
you are gonna be
a great novelist
cause you have created
a fictitious character
in your head about
no
yes
no
yes
no
i dont believe that
whyd you give up
on becoming an artist
because im too cynical
to be an artist
i think that to be
really really good
you have to come
from someplace inside
that im just not sure i have
you underestimate yourself
do you know that
edward um
will you come home with me
well thats a bit forward
yeah
its not what id expect
from a texas debutante
well you know
all debutantes
are sluts so
hmm
hmm
hmm
and you were
my first crush too
i know
we got a report
from ozona
someone else harassed
on the highway last night
just like you
if you dont mind
we could use
your fingerprints
mine
theres just a bunch of prints
on the trunk of the car
it could help us
sort em out
theres something else
yeah
we have the cause of death
your wife had
a fractured skull
she was probably struck
with a hammer
or a baseball bat
probably just once
or twice so
your daughter had
a much more difficult time
she was suffocated
she also had
a broken arm
and they had
both been raped
it turns out you were right
about that trailer too
how
those fellas
they took your folks
in there
just like you thought
how do you know that
we found your wifes
fingerprints on the bedpost
whose trailer is it
its clear
guy doesnt even live here
hes in el paso
trailers been broken into
somebodys been living in it
theres prints
all over the place
were gonna have to check em
against the owners
see if we can
separate em out
right
im hopeful though
the owner hasnt been there
since last fall so
looks promising
prom
promising
why didnt
you tell me this before
youre actually gonna
leave new york
move to austin and go
to the goddamn
university of texas
why are you doing this
i mean
where is this gonna go
what do you mean
where is this going to go
im going to marry edward
thats where this
is going to go
this is a ridiculous
conversation
youre too young
to get married
really
mom last summer you tried
to convince me that i had
to marry bass
that is different
bass is your equal
oh my god
did you just say that
you really just said that
that came out
of your mouth
thats
why do you always think
the worst of me
that is not what i meant
what i meant
is that you are very
strongwilled
and edward
as sweet as he is
hes too weak for you
weak is not a word
that i would use
to describe edward
sensitive is a word
that i would use
which isnt a word i would use
to describe anyone else
in this family
except maybe cooper
dont bring cooper
into this
sorry
come on susan
i know you think
that we dont care
about the same things
but youre wrong
in a few years
all these bourgeois things
as you so like to call them
are gonna be
very important to you
and edwards not gonna be able
to give them to you
he has no money
hes not driven
hes not ambitious
and i can promise you
if you marry edward
your fathers not gonna
give them to you either
no youre right
hes not driven
the way that you
would like him to be
but he is strong
hes stronger than i am
in a lot of ways
just he just has
a different kind
of strength is all
a different kind
of strength
and what kind
of strength is that
he has the strength
to believe in himself
and believe in me
susan
keep seeing him
if you have to
live with him
i dont care
but do not marry him
i understand
what you see in edward
i get it
no
no wait i do
no you dont
no you dont
yes i do
he is a romantic
but he is also
very fragile
i saw that
when his father died
dont
dont do this
youll regret it
and youll only hurt edward
in the end
the things you love
about him now are
the things youll hate
in a few years
you may not realize it
but you and i
are a lot more alike
than you think
no youre wrong
you and i are nothing alike
really
just wait
we all eventually
turn into our mothers
yeah
tony hastings
yes who is this
roberto andes
ive sent you an email
you get it
yes
well you recognize the guy
no
shit
god damn it
you sure
yeah the whole things
just a blur
well his prints
are all over your car
they found em
at the trailer too
his names steve adams
hes got a record
in california
a stolen car
acquittal on a rape charge
i put out an apb on him
hes the only lead
we got tony
and i sure as hell dont have
any other witnesses
you sure
you dont recognize him
no
fuck whats wrong
with you man
dont you wanna put
these guys away
yeah of course i do
the whole thing
is just some
just a blank
i know it was him
well that may be
but nobodys seen him
around here lately
listen i gotta be
honest with you
right now
its not looking good
sometimes these cases
go months or even years
without a break
you need to prepare
yourself for that
why are you
so driven to write
i guess its a way
of keeping things alive
you know saving things
that will eventually die
and if i write
it down then
itll last forever
afternoon
hey there
sorry im late
there was traffic
on the interstate
thats all right
you look different
no beard
you look
you look different too
yeah so ill tell you
what we got
we had an attempted holdup
at the supermarket
in the mall last night
just before closing

of the guys

dont forget you have
a board meeting
at the museum at 300
im sorry what was that
you didnt sleep again
did you
you know me
i never sleep
my exhusband
used to call me
a nocturnal animal
what exhusband
i didnt know
you had an exhusband
since when
a couple of years
in graduate school
its weird
ive been thinking
about him a lot lately
and then recently
he sent me this book
that hes written
and its
violent and its sad
and he titled it
nocturnal animals
and he dedicated it to me
did you love him
yeah i loved him
he was a writer and uh
i didnt have faith in him
i panicked
and i did something
horrible to him
something unforgivable
really
you left him
i left him
i left him in a brutal way
for the handsome
and dashing hutton
who is very handsome
and dashing
and dashing yes
do you ever feel like
your life has turned
into something
you never intended
no
of course not
you just started
living your life
you really didnt get
any sleep did you
no
where did
this painting come from
what do you mean
where did it come from
you bought it for us
remember
it was part of the series
like eight years ago
its great isnt it
yeah
what is that
oh my god
its so cool
its this app
that lets me watch willow
while shes in her crib
really do you not
trust your nanny
no no i do
i just hate her so
and i would like
to be more involved
with willow
throughout the day so
look there she is
and the sounds incredible
you can actually hear
her breathing
and i can talk to her
if i want to
im sorry
im so sorry im
are you okay
yeah
yeah i just
i thought i saw someone
well you did see someone
thats willow
and shes in her crib
shes sleeping
im really sorry
about your phone
i can um
its fine a new one comes out
next week anyway so
thanks
shall we
theyre all
waiting for us
were under
no contractual obligations
which is good
i know we all have different
you know opinions about this
but as far as im concerned
anyways
i think we should
cut her loose
she isnt who she sold herself
to be when we hired her
i disagree
i think we should keep her
for now
why is that
because shes great
and we all like her
she just needs our support
and a little bit of time
thats all
but its not working
we need to fire her
theres an awesome candidate
that we could steal
from the hammer
if we move fast
i agree with linda
we hired her
we should support her
new doctor
no new haircut
but susan you were the one
who brought it up last meeting
that you were
looking for a change
i know but now i think
we should keep her
sometimes its
sometimes maybe
its not such a good idea
to change things
quite so much
i dont get it
what are we doing here
shit
are you okay
yeah im fine
follow me
thats ray marcus
hes been named
as a frequent companion
of lou bates and steve adams
parttime electrician
parttime plumber
hence the clever
toilet facilities
hes not a bad match
to your description
and the fella at the holdup
no fingerprints
but we knew that before
i wonder why there arent
any fingerprints
well his hands
were probably on your wife
his records clean
except for a rape charge
that got dropped
i heard from this barman
at this place line camp bar
that ray lives here
with a girl named leila
but he also keeps another spot
to take girls
she dont know about
probably your murder trailer
before it got notorious
does he look like
he could be the guy
yes thats him
good

somebody else
i wanna know what they said
i wanna know what my wife said

what my daughter said
i wanna know
how you killed them
and i wanna know if they knew
it was happening to them
i wanna know what they felt
i wanna know if they hurt
answer me
answer me
answer me
you fucking bastard
is it better
youre gonna take this
the wrong way but um
i think that you
should write about something
other than yourself
nobody writes about anything
but themselves
i just my mind started
to wander when
i was reading it
and thats not good right
i dont know what to do
maybe you know
maybe i dont have
a book in me
maybe give yourself
some space
just do something else
can you not do that
what
because it
that makes me feel like
you dont believe in me
edward
thats not what i said
no you didnt say that
but youre saying it
with your face
and youre saying it
when you sigh
whatever youre saying it
when you say you want me
to go back to school
well yeah i do want you
to go back to school
i dont see
whats wrong with that
i mean
im just being a realist
i mean youre gonna
work at a book store
and just write a novel
like thats what
you wanna do
with your life
i mean
thats really romantic but
like what this is it
this is it this is what
you sound like your mother
well you always said
that i reminded you
so much of her so
you know this is exactly why
i dont wanna read your work
because you always get
so fucking defensive
yeah of course im defensive
do you know what it feels like
to put yourself out
on the line creatively
and then have someone
you love tell you that
they dont understand it
no i dont
because im not creative
thats because
you choose not to be
i dont wanna fight
im tired and im edgy
ive been writing all night
i just wanted you to like it
all right
thanks
i got some news
youre not gonna like
theyre letting ray marcus go
what what do you mean
theyre letting him go
the da says we dont have
enough hard evidence
what we have
is circumstantial
he needs corroboration
im real sorry tony
its a goddamn shame
at least you got to lay
a good belt on him
no thats not enough
what else can we do
i can think of something
youd better get
here quick though
he aint gonna
stick around for long
okay all right
im leaving now
what
i told you
i got lung cancer
its metastasized
but you smoke all the time
yeah well
thats how it works
whats the point
in quitting now
ill be dead in a year
its this fella named jenks
hes the lawyer
the court appointed for ray
hes a little smartass
from dallas
he and the da made a deal
and ray got off politics
when did you tell me
you were sick
see theyre trying
to force me out
they already got another fella
lined up for the job
i dont understand
what youre talking about
theyd drop a murder case
to do that
oh yeah
give em the reason
ammunition
they said my case
wasnt wellprepared
was a sloppy job slapdash
no evidence and evidence
improperly gathered
wont stand up in court
the das too much
of a chickenshit
to take a case he might lose
theyre not dropping lou
well its no fucking good
if we dont get ray
good
thats what i was
hoping youd say
they want me to retire
and enjoy the benefits
of my cancer somewhere else
fuck that
you never told me
about the cancer
the problem with ray
is his alibi
you have a family
ray claims he was with
that little
bobby bobby
what
do you have anyone
in your life
no no wife or
i have a daughter in corpus
has she been a help
she doesnt know
what can she do about it
anyway ray claims
he was with that little girl
leila whatever her name is
and she backs him up
her aunt backs her up
what are we gonna do
its a question
of how serious you are
about seeing justice done
you get me
i cant eat
gonna throw up
how are you gonna get
anything done
if you cant eat
sometimes i can
sometimes i cant
this place is terrible
i need you to eat something
so let me ask you
a personal question
off the record
between you and me
what do you want me to do
with ray marcus
well what can you do
with him
anything you goddamn like
but i thought
you said that
listen
i got nothin to lose
im not gonna let
this asshole da
fuck up my last case
im also not gonna stand by
and watch a murderer go free
ive seen too many sick fucks
