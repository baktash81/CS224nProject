this is part of my life story 
this part is called  riding the bus

this guy  he has a time machine 
he travels in the past
with this machine and    
  it is not a time machine 
it s a portable
bone density scanner 
a medical device i sell for a living 
thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you 
 i appreciate it 
 we just don t need it  chris 
it s unnecessary and expensive 
 well  maybe next

thanks anyway  very much 
 maybe next quarter

i needed to sell at least two scanners

i d have to sell one more   
   to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper 
the problem is   
   i haven t sold any for a while 
since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese 
since birth

it s for adults  chris can t use it 
she didn t know 
what are you supposed
to do with it 
make every side the same color 
did you pay the taxes 
no  i m gonna
have to file an extension 
 you already filed an extension 
 yeah  well  i gotta file another one 
that s   it s  650 
i ll have it in the next month 
that means interest  right 
 and a penalty 
 yeah  a little bit 
look  why don t you let me do this 
all right  just relax  okay 
 come here  calm down 
 i have to go back to work 
let s get ready for bed 
hey  put your plate in the sink 
a few days ago i was presented
with a report i d asked for   
   a comprehensive audit  if you will 
of our economic condition 
you won t like it  i didn t like it 
but we have to face the truth   
   and then go to work
to turn things around 
and make no mistake about it 
we can turn them around 
the federal budget is out of control 
and we face runaway deficits
of almost  80 billion   
   for this budget year
that ends september 30th 
that deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1 957 
and so is the almost  80 billion   
    we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt 
twenty years ago  in 1 960   
   our federal government payroll
was less than   1 3 billion 
today it is 75 billion 
during these 20 years  our population
has only increased by 23  3 percent    
man  i got two questions for you 
what do you do 
and how do you do it 
 i m a stockbroker 
 stockbroker  oh  goodness 
had to go to college
to be a stockbroker  huh 
you don t have to  have to be good
with numbers and good with people 
 that s it 
 hey  you take care 
i ll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend 
 but i need it back for monday 
 feed the meter 
i still remember that moment

by 3 inches on each side   
   made up of multiple colors
that you twist and turn   
   and try to get
to a solid color on each side 
this little cube
is the gift sensation of 1 98 1

supposed to be an i in  happiness  
 is it an adjective 
 no  actually it s a noun 
but it s not spelled right 
 is  fuck  spelled right 
 yeah  that s spelled right 
but that s not part of the motto 
so you re not supposed to learn that 
that s an adult word to show anger
and other things 
 but just don t use that one  okay
