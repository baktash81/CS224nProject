a few days ago i was presented
with a report id asked for
a comprehensive audit if you will
of our economic condition
you wont like it i didnt like it
but we have to face the truth
and then go to work
to turn things around
and make no mistake about it
we can turn them around
the federal budget is out of control
and we face runaway deficits
of almost 80 billion
for this budget year
that ends september 30th
that deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1 957
and so is the almost 80 billion
we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt
twenty years ago in 1 960
our federal government payroll
was less than  1 3 billion
today it is 75 billion
during these 20 years our population
has only increased by 23 3 percent
man i got two questions for you
