antelope comes into the world

mr  voss 
mr  voss  our textbook
says that
the discovery of penicillin
was the most important
biological discovery
of the 20th century 
but i read online
that this actually encourages
more potent strains
of infection 
yeah  that s some very
advanced  college y stuff 
look  if you re done
with your work 
just go sit down and draw
on your desk like martinez 
but i want to know 
because if
the textbook is wrong   
malia  the chances
of you actually using
anything you learn
in this class 
probably zero 
and i don t know if you
heard mr  betcher or not 
but  technically 
this is my vacation time now 
so i m going to shut
her down for a few

you want to go  just say no 
and we ll both know
it s code for yes  
you didn t really go  did you

i waited for two hours 
you said three 
yeah  but  you know 
actually  it s pretty hard
to see your watch
when you ve been crying 
okay  giving you
one last chance here 
you ve already given me
15 last chances  scott 
how about this 
i swing by   
no 
0 for 16 
hello 
thank you  everyone 
as several of you already know 
wilkinson high school
has been operating
at a budget deficit
for several years 
assistant principal elkins
and i have already conferred
with your union to try
to minimize the impact
on the classrooms 
but  unfortunately 
i have to make
some serious cuts 
starting immediately  we ll
be freezing all supplies 
and  unfortunately  we have to roll
back to last year s pay scales 
joke s on him  i didn t get
a raise this year anyway 
me  either 
also  despite best efforts 
we are cutting all
extracurricular activities 
which includes the debate club 
the music program 
the annual senior
class field trip   
excuse me 
you re talking about cutting
the music program 
you re actually
going to cut music 
i m sorry  we simply
don t have the funds 
no  wait a minute 
mr  betcher 
we re talking
about marty s job here 
how about all
the money we raised
in the car wash or
the silent auction 
miss flores  after expenses 
we only netted  750 
it s a drop in the bucket 
 verbis defectis
musica incipit   
that s latin for   music
takes us where word cannot  
i mean  what about
the athletic program 
those football players  they
get new jerseys every year 
wait  wait  wait 
wait  wait  wait 
are you trying to equate your music
program with the football team 
are you aware that
the booster club alone
accounts for one third
of our charitable donations 
this is a budget question 
and i just need
a little bit of that budget 
i ve got 60 kids
with dented instruments 
marty  what s your point 
music helps the kids with   
with math  the kids    the
kids don t raise money 
this is about a budget 
well  i   
i know how important   
you don t know 
take a seat 
come on  why don t you just
take it easy on the guy 
excuse me 
let it go  let it go 
just back off him 
and let s move on already 
why don t you not
tell me how to do my job 
okay  and then why don t
you tell him the truth 
this is how we got
thrown out of softball 
oh  and what would that be 
that you re cutting the music
program so he loses tenure 
that is ridiculous 
you are wasting
everyone s time 
really  you know what 
you re wasting my time 
okay  how does
a day without pay sound 
bring it 
really 
that s how you show your power 
you already docked me
a vacation day 
oh  oh  so    so that s
what this is all about  hmm 
the decision s been made 
yeah  well  every time you make
a decision  you know what 
you mess with somebody s life 
you know what  you have
just crossed the line 
no  i ll tell you
what s crossing the line 
firing a man
who s having a baby 
they don t know that i m
talking about you necessarily 
congratulations 
stop looking at me 
they know it s you now 
he s having a baby 
scott  you re talking
about a lot of money 
money the school
just doesn t have 
a lot of money  really 
how much could
it possibly cost 
 48  000 
so  as i was saying 
we have no choice
but to make these cuts 
yeah  or raise the money 
oh  and who s going to do that 
we will 
thank you 
i couldn t sleep
a wink last night 
my mind was racing 
and i bought you a coffee 
oh  and i spoke to elkins 
and he said we have to have
the money in by the end
of the school year  okay 
but then i made some fliers 
and i thought
we would all meet   
all the teachers at
5 00 this afternoon 
and you can give us
your game plan 
game plan 
yeah 
i m still kind of
sorting through everything 
that s great 
so  what do you think
about this 
i thought i would
start out talking
about how important
music really is 
and then i would
tell some stories 
like  did you know that ravel
liked to dress up like a lady 
is that too risqu√© 
you know  i think we should
probably just wing it 
okay  but you know what 
i have to thank you again 
i was driving in this morning 
i heard i won t back down
by tom petty  and i said 
 yes  that is a sign  
wow  are you solid 
okay 
okay  okay  5 00 
what s going on 
where is everybody 
well  the meeting
doesn t start till 5 00 
it s 5 15 
well  then you re late 
like everybody else 
where do you think they are 
  am i at the right place 
  yes 
you are  absolutely 
thank you so much
for coming  miss flores 
are you kidding me 
of course  marty 
you know what i m going to do 
i think i m going to go
round up the other teachers 
they got to be somewhere 
maybe they thought
it was in the cafeteria 
i think i saw
some people there 
yes  i m going to
try the cafeteria 
i m feeling good about this 
there s no one in
the cafeteria  is there 
just that janitor
that talks to himself 
i guess it was unrealistic
to think that
anybody would show up
when everybody has
their own problems 
you showed up 
you shut up 
i said   you showed up  
oh  i guess
i m unrealistic 
but i got to say 
it s really nice
what you re doing for marty 
well  we tried  you know  i
mean  what are you going to do 
what are you talking about 
you can t give up on him now 
he s so passionate
about what he does 
this school needs more
people like him  not less 
yeah  no  no 
i know  that s what   
no  i m saying
that s what we got to do 
we got to find a way
to make this thing work 
and we got to stick at it 
so  what exactly is the plan 
well  first off 
we got to get  48 000 
that s a definite 
then we should probably help
save marty s job after that 
wow  i can see that you put
a lot of thought into it 
well  how about this 
how about we work out a plan 
but we do it in
a controlled area 
which is my apartment 
and we put up charts and   
with the graphs and
the colored pencils 
but we have a plan  we go   we
got to get to here by then  
not a chance 
okay  you re
making me work at this 
i understand  i get it 
what if i dunk this ball
in that hoop 
then you have dinner with me
at my house friday night 
what do you say 
you dunk a basketball 
please 
fine  then take the bet 
deal 
where are you going 
oh  no  no  no  no  no 
come on  that s cheating 
oh  no  it s not 
that s   
no  that s not what i

here s the thing 
i need money
to save a friend s job 
a lot of money 
okay 
and as crazy as it sounds 
i want to fight mixed martial
arts  but i need your help 
i want you to train me 
you re kidding 
no  i can do this 
you re too old 
and on top of that 
you have no experience 
but there are guys that run
marathons well into their 80s 
not when they re
being punched in the face 
come on  you said it yourself 
wrestlers make great fighters 
and you know  when i was
younger  i took judo 
i mean  it was only for
three and a half weeks 
i had to stop  cause my sensei
got accepted into dental school 
but he said i had
wicked potential  man 
there s no way you can fight 
and that s the end of it 
okay  great 
what time are we
studying tonight 
you just quit 
look  you don t want to
train me  that s fine 
but we started this thing
and we re not gonna stop
until you re a citizen  okay 
okay 
you want to be a fighter 
you start in the cage 
there s a small time show
this weekend 
i ll get you in 
wait a second  no

shouldn t we train first 
no  trial by fire  baby 
i m a citizen 
you made my dream come true 
miguel   
i m going to name
my boy after you 
his name is sergio

that s nice  miguel 
let s slow things

a little walk and talk 
something wrong 
maybe 
ow 
ow 
come on  i got to do this 
i know  okay  okay 
oh 
okay  hold it for a minute 
this is a terrible mattress 
i m feeling everything 
this is ridiculous 
i m not gonna learn
any of this stuff 
i m telling you 
i m just gonna wrestle 
i m gonna take it
to the ground 
it s my world 
your world 
your world is
gonna be destroyed
by people who know
multiple disciplines 
the fight s in two days 
what am i gonna learn 
it is what it is 
i got it 
i know exactly
what you have to do 
you re gonna beat your opponent
before the match ever starts 
you re gonna learn the
ancient art of intimidation 
you ever actually
been in a fight 
no  well  none with a boy 
anyway 
but i know this is gonna work 
okay  so based on your limited
experience fighting girls 
how 
music 
you re gonna be
inspired by music 
that s why all the gladiators
entered the colosseum
with all that thundering music 
actually 
they do that in the ufc 
exactly 
and you re gonna
follow in the footsteps
of all those great warriors 
every one of them had
a distinctive musical theme
that put fear in the hearts
of their opponents 
which rendered them defeated
even before their match began 
i got it  you could
enter with pachelbel 
no  i know what i m doing 
with bach 
i don t need that  it s gonna be   
i have it

it s not sprained 
it s just a bruise 
good   cause i

i m going to have to
start charging you

have to start charging you 
speaking of which   
what s this 
 72 from my bake sale 
i had to do something 
this is amazing  thank you 
i got to give it to you 
it s been a long time
since i felt any kind
of energy in this school 
yeah 
yeah  i don t understand
how we got so far off track 
we 
it s not our fault 
it s the system 
go easy 
oh  so it s the system
that s creating teachers
who just don t care 
oh  come on 
you know the deal 
you can t speed up to
help the gifted kids 
you can t slow down to
help the slower ones 
it s about moving
cattle through  you know 
it s a numbers game 
that s what they want 
but what about you 
yeah  look  there was a time
i couldn t wait for
the school year to start 
i was like a    a freshman
decorating my dorm 
you know  i d put posters
up all over the place
and i d set up
these plastic models 
no  you didn t 
i did  i would jump up
on the desk just to
get the kids into it 
it was so stupid 
no  it s not 
i think i would have liked you
better when you were that stupid 
all right  well  look 
i need to repay you
for all this right here 
and i think this equals dinner
at my house on friday 
no  i don t think so 
why do you always turn me down 
do you know there s a lunch
lady who s got the hots for me 
and i m just telling you  i can
only hold her off for so long 
do you even know
that every time
you ve asked me out 
you ve done it from
a seated position 
you don t even make
an effort to get up 
that s because we re
so comfortable together 
i think  when it s easy 
it s right  you know 
good bye  scott 
all right

what do you think  oh  i get nothing 
all right

i want to start working
on my offense 
it s too dangerous 
i won 
you landed a lucky shot 
all right  look 
i know you don t want me
getting hurt  i get that 
but i made twice as much
money my last fight 
i don t think my body
can take 30 more fights 
yeah 
i m just saying  if i could actually
win a few more  i could fight less 
yeah  yeah  you re right 
okay  well  then you need
to get good at striking 
fast 
yes 
i know the best guy
for that  but   
he probably won t take you 
this isn t you
learning anything 
this isn t me
teaching you anything

good night  scott 
voss 
my office  now 
come on in 
close the door 
sit down 
i d like you to meet malia s
father  mr  de la cruz 
how are you 
who the hell do you
think you are  mr  voss 
telling my daughter
to disobey me 
i didn t say that 
i said    i said that   
and is it true
you re getting paid to fight 
it s mixed martial arts 
what s this all about 
it s about our teachers not
promoting dangerous situations 
look  it s a sport 
it s no more dangerous
than boxing or auto racing 
and believe me 
i wouldn t be doing it
if you d been doing your job 
did you really think
that you could save
the music program
by doing this 
i m just trying to
make things better 
you know what 
you re not making
things better  scott 
you re putting on a show 
you re getting beat up
in your bathing suit 
you are embarrassing
this school 
you know why i did this
in the first place 
because a wise man once said 
 without music 
life would be a mistake  
yeah  and do you know
who that wise man is 
marty streb  the teacher
you re trying to get rid of 
scott   
there s nothing here any more 
we re failing your daughter 
we need good teachers 
yeah  well  fighting in a cage
is not going to make you
a good teacher  scott 
you know  maybe you re right 
i m not even that good
of a fighter 
i m out there
getting my ass kicked 
believe me  this wasn t plan a 
but i don t know
what else to do 
look  you re having a tough
time with your business 
i get it 
but you can t
take it out on malia 
mr  de la cruz  i m sorry that you
had to listen to any of this 
no  no  no 
it s all right  what do you
suggest i do  mr  voss 
my chef left 
that means i m in
the back cooking 
sol need my daughter up front 
it sucks  okay 
nobody s saying it doesn t 
but it s not your
daughter s problem 
it s yours 
no 
you re the problem  scott 
this is none of your business 
none of your business 
i ve had it with you 
you know what 
we should be working
as hard in here as
you do out there 
and i m sorry  but we re not 
and that is the problem 
now  if you ll excuse me 
i have a class to teach 
and then i got to roll around
with a sweaty guy from holland 
whoa  what s going on 
mr  voss 
biology  derrick 
fair enough 
can someone tell me what
happens when a cell stagnates 
okay 
no one is listening to me 
i will try again 
anyone know what happens
to a stagnant cell 
what s he doing on the table 
i don t know 
something about cells 
malia 
it s not good 
did you hear that 
it ain t good 
people  a cell
that is not in motion
is not a productive member
of the system 
it ends up assuming
all the other cells
are gonna pick up
the slack somewhere 
but they don t 
in fact 
they imitate the stray cell
until basically the whole
organism begins to die 
yeah 
but you know what 
biology is an amazing thing 
and here s the good news 
all that decays
can be restored 
is this hitting anybody 
like how a cut heals 
brian  my man 
look  you got one 
and once that
cell s back on track 
it creates energy
amongst the other cells 
that s what happens 
it starts getting
a little movement going 
it gets a little rumble 
can i get a little rumble
from everybody 
everybody just rumble in
your seats right now for me 
just rumble a little bit 
okay  no rumble  that s fine 
i ll be the
lone rumbler up here 
that s what i am 
i m a lone rumbler 
but then the cell starts
banging into the other cells 
and the cells push back and go 
 hey  what are you doing to me  
they hit into another one 
 hey  don t do that  
 hey  that s my friend  
 you don t even know him  
 you don t know me either  
and they re
rumbling everything around 
and once that happens 
it s like a mosh pit 
they re goin  crazy   
 i know you 
we work together  
because then 
they hit a rhythm 
they all hit a rhythm 
and this is the beginning
of the restorative process 
so now 
even if the entire system
is close to dead  what happens 
martinez  come on 
give me something 
oh  no  not today 
oh  no  not in my house 
no  no  no  no 
look out  here we come 
don t look up
my pant leg  derrick 
you re better than that 
i m right over you 
come on  man 
what do you say 
if all the cells work
together  what will happen 
the entire system is healed 
exactly 
that is a sick dragon 
yeah 
move it  come on 
scott  keep working 
hey  you know what 
you look as good going
as you do coming 
and you  my friend  sat in gum 
please be gum 
okay  so how many years
is a term of the president 
a president serves a term
of two years

is going to be
very interesting

the respect of dietrich
