antelope comes into the world

biological discovery
of the 20th century

that this actually encourages
more potent strains
of infection

advanced collegey stuff
look if youre done
with your work
just go sit down and draw
on your desk like martinez
but i want to know
because if
the textbook is wrong

i swing by
no
0 for 16
hello
thank you everyone
as several of you already know
wilkinson high school
has been operating
at a budget deficit
for several years
assistant principal elkins
and i have already conferred
with your union to try
to minimize the impact
on the classrooms
but unfortunately
i have to make
some serious cuts
starting immediately well
be freezing all supplies
and unfortunately we have to roll
back to last years pay scales
jokes on him i didnt get
a raise this year anyway
me either
also despite best efforts
we are cutting all
extracurricular activities
which includes the debate club
the music program
the annual senior
class field trip
excuse me
youre talking about cutting
the music program
youre actually
going to cut music
im sorry we simply
dont have the funds
no wait a minute
mr betcher
were talking
about martys job here
how about all
the money we raised
in the car wash or
the silent auction
miss flores after expenses
we only netted 750
its a drop in the bucket
verbis defectis
musica incipit
thats latin for music
takes us where word cannot
i mean what about
the athletic program
those football players they
get new jerseys every year
wait wait wait
wait wait wait
are you trying to equate your music
program with the football team
are you aware that
the booster club alone
accounts for onethird
of our charitable donations
this is a budget question
and i just need
a little bit of that budget
ive got 60 kids
with dented instruments
marty whats your point
music helps the kids with
with math the kids the
kids dont raise money
this is about a budget
well i
i know how important
you dont know
take a seat
come on why dont you just
take it easy on the guy
excuse me
let it go let it go
just back off him
and lets move on already
why dont you not
tell me how to do my job
okay and then why dont
you tell him the truth
this is how we got
thrown out of softball
oh and what would that be
that youre cutting the music
program so he loses tenure
that is ridiculous
you are wasting
everyones time
really you know what
youre wasting my time
okay how does
a day without pay sound
bring it
really
thats how you show your power
you already docked me
a vacation day
oh oh so so thats
what this is all about hmm
the decisions been made
yeah well every time you make
a decision you know what
you mess with somebodys life
you know what you have
just crossed the line
no ill tell you
whats crossing the line
firing a man
whos having a baby
they dont know that im
talking about you necessarily
congratulations
stop looking at me
they know its you now
hes having a baby
scott youre talking
about a lot of money
money the school
just doesnt have
a lot of money really
how much could
it possibly cost
48 000
so as i was saying
we have no choice
but to make these cuts
yeah or raise the money
oh and whos going to do that
we will
thank you
i couldnt sleep
a wink last night
my mind was racing
and i bought you a coffee
oh and i spoke to elkins
and he said we have to have
the money in by the end
of the school year okay
but then i made some fliers
and i thought
we would all meet
all the teachers at
500 this afternoon
and you can give us
your game plan
game plan
yeah
im still kind of
sorting through everything
thats great
so what do you think
about this
i thought i would
start out talking
about how important
music really is
and then i would
tell some stories
like did you know that ravel
liked to dress up like a lady
is that too risqu√©
you know i think we should
probably just wing it
okay but you know what
i have to thank you again
i was driving in this morning
i heard i wont back down
by tom petty and i said
yes that is a sign
wow are you solid
okay
okay okay 500
whats going on
where is everybody
well the meeting
doesnt start till 500
its 515
well then youre late
like everybody else
where do you think they are
am i at the right place
yes
you are absolutely
thank you so much
for coming miss flores
are you kidding me
of course marty
you know what im going to do
i think im going to go
round up the other teachers
they got to be somewhere
maybe they thought
it was in the cafeteria
i think i saw
some people there
yes im going to
try the cafeteria
im feeling good about this
theres no one in
the cafeteria is there
just that janitor
that talks to himself
i guess it was unrealistic
to think that
anybody would show up
when everybody has
their own problems
you showed up
you shut up
i said you showed up
oh i guess
im unrealistic
but i got to say
its really nice
what youre doing for marty
well we tried you know i
mean what are you going to do
what are you talking about
you cant give up on him now
hes so passionate
about what he does
this school needs more
people like him not less
yeah no no
i know thats what
no im saying
thats what we got to do
we got to find a way
to make this thing work
and we got to stick at it
so what exactly is the plan
well first off
we got to get 48000
thats a definite
then we should probably help
save martys job after that
wow i can see that you put
a lot of thought into it
well how about this
how about we work out a plan
but we do it in
a controlled area
which is my apartment
and we put up charts and
with the graphs and
the colored pencils
but we have a plan we go we
got to get to here by then
not a chance
okay youre
making me work at this

what if i dunk this ball
in that hoop

im gonna take it
to the ground
its my world
your world
your world is
gonna be destroyed
by people who know
multiple disciplines
the fights in two days
what am i gonna learn
it is what it is
i got it
i know exactly
what you have to do
youre gonna beat your opponent
before the match ever starts
youre gonna learn the
ancient art of intimidation
you ever actually
been in a fight
no well none with a boy
anyway
but i know this is gonna work
okay so based on your limited
experience fighting girls
how
music
youre gonna be
inspired by music
thats why all the gladiators
entered the colosseum
with all that thundering music
actually
they do that in the ufc
exactly
and youre gonna
follow in the footsteps
of all those great warriors
every one of them had
a distinctive musical theme
that put fear in the hearts
of their opponents
which rendered them defeated
even before their match began
i got it you could
enter with pachelbel
no i know what im doing
with bach
i dont need that its gonna be
i have it
dont
mozarts 35th in d major

you cant speed up to
help the gifted kids
you cant slow down to
help the slower ones
its about moving
cattle through you know
its a numbers game
thats what they want
but what about you
yeah look there was a time
i couldnt wait for
the school year to start
i was like a a freshman
decorating my dorm
you know id put posters

and id set up
these plastic models

get the kids into it
it was so stupid

only hold her off for so long

father mr de la cruz
how are you
who the hell do you
think you are mr voss
telling my daughter
to disobey me
i didnt say that
i said i said that
and is it true
youre getting paid to fight
its mixed martial arts
whats this all about
its about our teachers not
promoting dangerous situations
look its a sport
its no more dangerous
than boxing or auto racing
and believe me
i wouldnt be doing it
if youd been doing your job
did you really think
that you could save
the music program
by doing this
im just trying to
make things better
you know what
youre not making
things better scott
youre putting on a show
youre getting beat up
in your bathing suit
you are embarrassing
this school
you know why i did this
in the first place
because a wise man once said
without music
life would be a mistake
yeah and do you know
who that wise man is
marty streb the teacher
youre trying to get rid of
scott
theres nothing here any more
were failing your daughter
we need good teachers
yeah well fighting in a cage
is not going to make you
a good teacher scott
you know maybe youre right
im not even that good
of a fighter
im out there
getting my ass kicked
believe me this wasnt plan a
but i dont know
what else to do
look youre having a tough
time with your business
i get it
but you cant
take it out on malia
mr de la cruz im sorry that you
had to listen to any of this
no no no
its all right what do you
suggest i do mr voss
my chef left
that means im in
the back cooking
sol need my daughter up front
it sucks okay
nobodys saying it doesnt
but its not your
daughters problem
its yours
no
youre the problem scott
this is none of your business
none of your business
ive had it with you
you know what
we should be working
as hard in here as
you do out there
and im sorry but were not
and that is the problem
now if youll excuse me
i have a class to teach
and then i got to roll around
with a sweaty guy from holland
whoa whats going on
mr voss
biology derrick
fair enough
can someone tell me what
happens when a cell stagnates
okay
no one is listening to me
i will try again
anyone know what happens
to a stagnant cell
whats he doing on the table
i dont know
something about cells
malia
its not good
did you hear that
it aint good
people a cell
that is not in motion
is not a productive member
of the system
it ends up assuming
all the other cells
are gonna pick up
the slack somewhere
but they dont
in fact
they imitate the stray cell
until basically the whole
organism begins to die
yeah
but you know what
biology is an amazing thing
and heres the good news
all that decays
can be restored
is this hitting anybody
like how a cut heals
brian my man
look you got one
and once that
cells back on track
it creates energy
amongst the other cells
thats what happens
it starts getting
a little movement going
it gets a little rumble
can i get a little rumble
from everybody
everybody just rumble in
your seats right now for me
just rumble a little bit
okay no rumble thats fine
ill be the
lone rumbler up here
thats what i am
im a lone rumbler
but then the cell starts
banging into the other cells
and the cells push back and go
hey what are you doing to me
they hit into another one
hey dont do that
hey thats my friend
you dont even know him
you dont know me either
and theyre
rumbling everything around
and once that happens
its like a mosh pit
theyre goin crazy
i know you
we work together
because then
they hit a rhythm
they all hit a rhythm
and this is the beginning
of the restorative process
so now
even if the entire system
is close to dead what happens
martinez come on
give me something
oh no not today
oh no not in my house
no no no no
look out here we come
dont look up
my pant leg derrick
youre better than that
im right over you
come on man
what do you say
if all the cells work
together what will happen
the entire system is healed
exactly
that is a sick dragon
yeah
move it come on
scott keep working
hey you know what
you look as good going
as you do coming
and you my friend sat in gum
please be gum
