d c 
lloyd  she s being difficult 
  i m taking out diane court 
  not likely 
  is the movies a good second date 
  you never had a first 
i sat across from her in a mall 
we ate 
  sharing an important physical event 
  that s not even a scam 
  a scam 
  going out as friends 
  no  scam is lusting 
  then what s a date 
a date is prearrangement
with a possibility for love 
then what s love 
i m gonna call her 
she doesn t date guys like you 
she s a brain 
with the body of a game show hostess 
she doesn t know she s pretty 
  that s what s cool about her 
  brains stay with brains 
if a bomb goes off 
their genes form the same cliques 
  i wouldn t get my hopes up 
  i m sorry 
you re a really nice guy 
we don t wanna see you get hurt 
i wanna get hurt 
 it s almost over  we ve gone
to school together for three years  
  i might cut that part 
  why  that s fine  it s nice 
 lloyd s tape gets eaten 
 music plays normally 
 having taken courses at the
university  i ve glimpsed our future 
and all i can say is 
 go back   
 go back   what a great line 
  you like it 
  yeah 
  i didn t think anyone would get it 
  no  it s wonderful  it s   
no  don t worry about it 
you re very funny 
   go back   that s great 
  no more  i m gonna save it 
sings very badly 
i decided long ago
never to walk in anyone s shadow
if i fail
if i succeed
at least i live as i believe
no matter what they take from me
they can t take away my dignity
because the greatest love of all
is happening to me
i found the greatest
love of all inside of me
i love you guys 
thanks  pal

 mr  court laughs

we ve gone to school together
for three years   
   and we ve been through a lot 
but with that training net
of high school gone   
   what s gonna happen to us 
we all know what the answers are 
we wanna be happy  go to college 
work hard  maybe raise a family 
but what if that doesn t happen 
i have to be honest  though 
i have all the hope
and ambition in the world 
but when i think about the future   
   the truth is   
   i am   
   really   
   scared

i don t think he s reeling
in embarrassment 
good night

corey  lloyd is doomed

  why 
  too much pressure  not his crowd 
what s wrong with her 
  i told him to be himself 
  he has that nervous talking thing 
i told him not to speak 
this is a strange thing to say 
but maybe diane really likes lloyd 
if you were her 
would you honestly fall for lloyd 
  yeah

  if you re gonna tell it  let me 
  well  let me start 
i decide to take her
on her first airplane 
i knew how planes flew
but i was nervous 
crash paranoia 
i had a list  if babies were on
the plane  it couldn t crash 
but their crying meant
they knew something 
they closed the doors and she screams 
like nobody i d ever heard 
  you said   turn around  
  they did 
  let me finish 
  okay 
so two federal marshals
meet the plane 
they take our address and ask us
never to fly the friendly skies again 
  you never flew 
  no 
but there s more 
there was somebody on the plane   
   who worked in a recording studio 
he s making a sound effects record 
and he wants to record her scream 
which they did  and once
in a while on a commercial   
   you can hear me scream 
you two are amazing  you know 
the way you    the way you talk 
i m just like that   
i m not like that with anybody

if you wanna stop by 
  wanna do something later 
  i know you think my job s strange 
  you don t like old people  do you 
  sure i do 
come on 
i used to work at a smorgasbord 
old people came  and they love to eat 
they jammed their mouths  ate with
their mouths open and it was too much 
you think about how short life is   
   and how maybe life has no meaning 
you re frying burgers 
then you re like 60  you die
and what are you doing 
i don t need to think about it 
that s the reason i was   
but i m not sure i m right 
that s ageism  being prejudiced
against people because they re old 
  maybe their mouths don t work well 
  really 
well  you re really
turning me around here 
i was looking at it
the wrong way  i think 
  should i still come by 
  stop by later

i just don t want it to get too heavy 
i feel really overloaded 
i have a theory that good things

i don t know why they have
to happen at the same time 
i wish i could work out a schedule

good morning 
  dad  i m sorry 
  you should be 
  i should have called 
  you bet you should have 
don t make me call the police 
don t make me call hospitals 
dad  i m so sorry 
i know this is a bad time 
i m not asking what you did 
i wanna know   
   if you re okay 
  i m fine 
you wanna make things easier 
tell me where you were 
this is bullshit 
  you can say anything to me  you know 
  i know that 
i spent the night with him 
  lloyd 
  dad  yes 
and i m scared to death of what
you must think of me right now 
sit down 
dad  do you know what he did
the first night i went out with him 
we were walking across by the 7 11   
   and he pointed out some glass
for me to walk around 
i think of that when people say 
 what are you doing with lloyd  
and i never get nervous around him 
so we started spending all
this time together  as friends 
but i could feel him getting anxious 
and then   
   i knew that there would be
a confrontation over getting physical 
he started to get that look
at the end of the night 
do you know that look 
you know it will be an issue 
so i went through all the feelings
and arguments you go through   
  did he ever get rough with you 
  dad  no 
but i didn t want any problems 
so i decided not to sleep with him 
but then i attacked him anyway 
it always feels good
to tell you the truth 
because   
   if i can t share it with you 
it s almost like it didn t happen 
did you sleep with her 
  i admit nothing 
  it s us 
  look at his face  he did the deed 
  you re an inspiration  lloyd 
all right  calm down 
nothing s different 
lloyd  listen to me  everything
has changed  you ve had sex 
nothing will ever be the same
between you two 
you might be 60  you ll see her 
talk to her  whatever   
but what you ll really
be thinking is   we had sex  
  your point 
  do something special 
  you gotta make a statement 
  wait   
show her respect 
show her you re not like joe 
  wait   
  above all   
   just because this happened
gives you no right   
  you never let me talk 
  what  i m sorry  talk 
forgot what i was gonna say 
okay  i remember 
  let him do what he wants 
  all right 
send her flowers
or write her a letter 
i already did 
  what s it say 
  just read it 
i can read it 
oh  man 
 dear diane 
i ll always be there for you 
all the love in my heart   
   lioyd  
i ve never gotten a letter
like this  have you 
  i dream about it 
  so  what do you think 
  you think i m    
  get ready for greatness  lloyd 
the cynthia bramson estate
was worth how much 
  her family   
  family  never heard from them 
i sold her house for her 
made her money 
your income  mr  court   
   hasn t changed substantially
in 17 years 
that s right 
why would you stay so long
with an operation   
   that is clearly not
a growth enterprise 
caring for people
isn t a growth enterprise 
write that down 
i d like your boss to read it 
diane 
ticket to england came today 
maybe i shouldn t go
with all that s happening 
you re going 
if a friend were in the same position 
i d tell her to stay 
  you re going 
  it doesn t feel right 
  i don t even have the right luggage 
  bon voyage 
  you re not listening to me 
  let s stop this right now 
let s not put our energy
into something ridiculous

why are you acting this way 
is it because of the other morning 
mr  court 
you love him 
  i like him a lot 
  now  i know you like him 
he s not like those
frat kids you dislike 
but when the excitement wears off   
   what are you gonna talk about 
you ll be in an
international think tank   
   and he s gonna be
kicking punching bags 
i think you should break up with him 
unbelievable  this is a nightmare 
it d be best to get on
that plane with no strings   
   because once you leave 
things will change 
i ve talked about this
with you and with him 
it s well covered territory 
i m not asking you to sever
all relations with the boy 
give him a present  here 
let him know you still care 
give him this pen 
a pen 
dad  in a million years 
i would never give him a pen 
why can t i have fun  i like him 
 i like him   i m talking
about being honest and decent   
dad  i love him 
great 
no  that s great 
it s great to hear
you say that because   
i don t know 
what  am i being selfish 
why am i so fixated

a lot of troubles with   
is that it  am i being selfish 
i want you to have everything

i owe you an apology 
i ve just got a few weeks
left with you and we

   from phony billing  phony patients 
we ve been investigating him 
when they die  he takes their money 
pardon me 
check it out for yourself 
see if your father fits the profile 
  what s the profile 
  take a look around the house

pieces of art  stereo equipment 
things bought with cash

it s for when you
get back from england
