corey lloyd is doomed

she made this date a family audition
the kiss of death for lloyd
why
too much pressure not his crowd
whats wrong with her
i told him to be himself

well let me start
i decide to take her
on her first airplane
i knew how planes flew
but i was nervous
crash paranoia
i had a list if babies were on
the plane it couldnt crash
but their crying meant
they knew something
they closed the doors and she screams
like nobody id ever heard
you said turn around
they did
let me finish
okay
so two federal marshals
meet the plane
they take our address and ask us
never to fly the friendly skies again
you never flew
no
but theres more
there was somebody on the plane
who worked in a recording studio
hes making a sound effects record
and he wants to record her scream
which they did and once
in a while on a commercial
you can hear me scream
you two are amazing you know
the way you the way you talk
im just like that
im not like that with anybody

i used to work at a smorgasbord
old people came and they love to eat
they jammed their mouths ate with
their mouths open and it was too much

and how maybe life has no meaning
youre frying burgers
then youre like 60 you die

i just dont want it to get too heavy
i feel really overloaded
i have a theory that good things

i dont know why they have

yeah
in your eyes plays
diane moans
lloyd are you comfortable

i dont think i am
then why are you shaking
i dont know
i think im happy
heres some blanket
listen to this song
its a really good song
good morning
dad im sorry
you should be
i should have called
you bet you should have
dont make me call the police
dont make me call hospitals
dad im so sorry
i know this is a bad time
im not asking what you did
i wanna know
if youre okay
im fine
you wanna make things easier
tell me where you were
this is bullshit
you can say anything to me you know
i know that
i spent the night with him
lloyd
dad yes
and im scared to death of what
you must think of me right now
sit down
dad do you know what he did
the first night i went out with him
we were walking across by the 711
and he pointed out some glass
for me to walk around
i think of that when people say
what are you doing with lloyd
and i never get nervous around him
so we started spending all
this time together as friends
but i could feel him getting anxious
and then
i knew that there would be
a confrontation over getting physical
he started to get that look
at the end of the night
do you know that look
you know it will be an issue
so i went through all the feelings
and arguments you go through
did he ever get rough with you
dad no
but i didnt want any problems
so i decided not to sleep with him
but then i attacked him anyway
it always feels good
to tell you the truth
because
if i cant share it with you
its almost like it didnt happen
did you sleep with her
i admit nothing
its us
look at his face he did the deed
youre an inspiration lloyd
all right calm down
nothings different
lloyd listen to me everything
has changed youve had sex
nothing will ever be the same
between you two
you might be 60 youll see her
talk to her whatever
but what youll really
be thinking is we had sex
your point
do something special
you gotta make a statement
wait
show her respect
show her youre not like joe
wait
above all
just because this happened
gives you no right
you never let me talk
what im sorry talk
forgot what i was gonna say
okay i remember
let him do what he wants
all right
send her flowers
or write her a letter
i already did
whats it say
just read it
i can read it
oh man
dear diane
ill always be there for you
all the love in my heart
lioyd
ive never gotten a letter
like this have you
i dream about it
so what do you think
you think im
get ready for greatness lloyd
the cynthia bramson estate
was worth how much
her family
family never heard from them
i sold her house for her
made her money
your income mr court
hasnt changed substantially
in 17 years
thats right
why would you stay so long
with an operation
that is clearly not
a growth enterprise
caring for people
isnt a growth enterprise
write that down
id like your boss to read it
diane
ticket to england came today
maybe i shouldnt go
with all thats happening
youre going
if a friend were in the same position
id tell her to stay
youre going
it doesnt feel right
i dont even have the right luggage
bon voyage
youre not listening to me
lets stop this right now
lets not put our energy
into something ridiculous
this isnt smart thinking
why are you acting this way
is it because of the other morning
mr court
you love him
i like him a lot
now i know you like him
hes not like those
frat kids you dislike
but when the excitement wears off
what are you gonna talk about
youll be in an
international think tank
and hes gonna be
kicking punching bags
i think you should break up with him
unbelievable this is a nightmare
itd be best to get on
that plane with no strings
because once you leave
things will change
ive talked about this
with you and with him
its wellcovered territory
im not asking you to sever
all relations with the boy
give him a present here

be a little decent
we believe your father
has a large pool of cash
from phony billing phony patients
weve been investigating him
when they die he takes their money
pardon me
check it out for yourself
see if your father fits the profile
whats the profile
take a look around the house
are there a lot of rugs
pieces of art stereo equipment
things bought with cash
does he give lots of gifts
do the major items in your house
you want me to say something
dont let his business
infect your life
how can you say that
hes guilty
no hes not
we have the records
we have the proof
im sorry to have to tell you this
