nice kick
very nice kick
give me the ball
justin
drop put me down
ok down like
oh sorry
goodness
hey
hi
ok you are really getting good
you too
i mean when we first started going out
you couldnt kiss at all
i meant at soccer
really
absolutely youre
probably already better
than half the guys on my team
probably more than half
what do you mean
i couldnt kiss at all
dont worry ive taught you well
i know
ok but seriously dont you think
youd get more playing time
at a school like michigan
maybe but its always been
about being a tar heel for me
im gonna wear that carolina blue
yeah
yeah baby
ok what is the lacrosse team
doing on our field
the school cut our team
wait what
not enough girls signed up
so they just cut us
they cant do that
ok this is not over
hi girls i heard the bad news
bad its a disaster
now college scouts
wont even get to see us play
i know if theres anything i can do
just say the word
matter of fact there is
we wanna try out for the boys team
anything besides that
coach come on
you know that were good enough
i dont know that
thats a thing that i know
what
all were asking for is one shot
yeah
girls
we have two weeks before school starts
then we open against illyria
a rivalry game we have to win
and we can help you win
hey baby
hey
whats going on coach
the girls here want
to try out for the team
youre not serious
all right all right
youre all excellent players
but girls arent as fast as boys
right
what
or as strong or as athletic
this is not me talking
its a scientific fact
girls cant beat boys
its as simple as that
ok justin youre the team captain
what do you think about it
i think the coach said it all
yesterday you told me that i was better
than half the guys on your team
what
i never said that
what are you talking about
why are you lying
viola end of discussion
yeah tell her man
fine end of relationship

of cornwall for skipping
this is not exactly the way
you want to start out
i want to be a musician
last time i heard
they dont need to know trigonometry

as female soccer players

so youre telling me
hes not just another dumb jock
who wants to hook up with me so
he could tell his friends but too
insecure to treat you as an equal
exactly
tell me about it
youre the first guy at school
who hasnt tried anything with me
trust me youre not my type
well why not
you know its just
i dont think of you in that way
were friends you know

why do you always do that
why do you always talk about girls
in such graphic terms
you know what you you have issues
youre a really sensitive guy
arent you
what no no its just
i dont know i just think that
relationships should be more
than just the physical stuff

even refined handsome you know
oh and when he smiles
i just cant stop looking at him
hes just so wonderful
you know olivia
its olivia right

oh this is not good
and hello to you
you little homewrecker
who are you
i am sebastians girlfriend
exgirlfriend
ok everybodys got to stop saying that
you were the one he dumped

when debutantes disagree
they say it with their eyes
well hastings
why is it that i always find you
in the middle of a tussle
bad timing
i am convinced hes hiding something
nonsense malcolm
he may be a little lost and confused
but deep down hes an allamerican
redblooded male
just like yourself
mom i will pick out
my own dress
and no i will not wear heels
because heels are a male invention
designed to make
a womans butt look smaller
and to make it harder
for them to run away
malcolm have you ever tried
to run away in high heels
no sir i wouldnt
not that easy not that easy
dont forget your guitar mr hastings
just do it
just close your eyes and kiss him

the girls team at cornwall got cut

to be my brother
while he was in london
for the past two weeks
so i could make the team
and beat cornwall
but my brother came home early
and thats who you saw kissing olivia
and thats who played the first half

this isnt how i wanted it to happen
and i didnt want to hurt you
but i just wanted to prove
that i was good enough
all im asking for is a chance
duke
its just like what coach says
before every game
be not afraid of greatness
some are born great
some achieve greatness
and some have greatness
thrust upon them
i think the best chance for us to be
great here today is to have you play

no playing
you have to forfeit
theres no girls in this league
look in the manual
what manual

well folks this is a real nailbiter
its a tie score at the bottom
of the second half
come on come on open up

where you gonna kick it right here

told you who i was but
i was afraid

everything would just be a lot easier
if you stayed a girl
