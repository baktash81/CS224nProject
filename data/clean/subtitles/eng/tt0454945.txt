  ok  you are really getting good 
  you too 
i mean  when we first started going out 
you couldn t kiss at all 
  i meant at soccer 
  really 
absolutely  you re   
   probably already better
than half the guys on my team 
probably more than half 
what do you mean 
i couldn t kiss at all 
don t worry  i ve taught you well 
i know 
ok  but seriously  don t you think
you d get more playing time
at a school like michigan 
maybe  but it s always been
about being a tar heel for me 
i m gonna wear that carolina blue 
  yeah 
  yeah  baby 
ok  what is the lacrosse team
doing on our field 
  the school cut our team 
  wait  what 
  not enough girls signed up 
  so they just cut us 
they can t do that 
ok  this is not over 
hi  girls  i heard the bad news 
 bad   it s a disaster 
now college scouts
won t even get to see us play 
i know  if there s anything i can do 
just say the word 
matter of fact  there is 
we wanna try out for the boys team 
anything besides that 
coach  come on 
you know that we re good enough 
i don t know that
that s a thing that i know 
what 
all we re asking for is one shot 
  yeah 
  girls 
we have two weeks before school starts 
then we open against illyria 
a rivalry game  we have to win 
and we can help you win 
  hey  baby 
  hey 
what s going on  coach 
the girls here want
to try out for the team 
  you re not serious 
  all right  all right 
you re all excellent players 
  but girls aren t as fast as boys 
  right 
  what 
  or as strong  or as athletic 
this is not me talking 
it s a scientific fact 
girls can t beat boys 
it s as simple as that 
ok  justin  you re the team captain 
what do you think about it 
i think the coach said it all 
yesterday you told me that i was better
than half the guys on your team 
what 
i never said that 
what are you talking about 
why are you lying  
viola  end of discussion 
yeah  tell her  man 
fine  end of relationship

i think it s your total lack of curves 
hi  monique 
it s so good to see you too 
i m looking for sebastian  where is he 
i don t know 
just remind your brother
how lucky he is to be in my life 
and tell him to give me a call
if he wants to stay in it  ok 
ok  does he have your number 
1 800 beyotch 
she will do great things 
i have a surprise for you

this is just the thing
to just perk you up 
  hold on

keep your eyes closed 
  eyes closed  closed  closed  closed 
  they re closed 
all right  surprise 
beautiful gowns
for my darling debutante 
mom  have i not
told you a thousand times 
i have no interest in being a debutante 
it s totally archaic 
how could i wind up with a daughter
who only wants to kick
a muddy ball around a field all day 
well  the world has been set right  mom 
they cut my team 
  what  no soccer 
  yeah  that s right  no soccer 
  how sad 
  yeah  i can see you re all torn up 
well  justin s gonna love you in this 
yet another reason not to wear it 
i dumped him 
  what  why 
  i don t wanna talk about it 
he s so handsome and rugged
and chiseled and great 
then why don t you date him  mom 
no  i couldn t 
  hey  sebastian 
  hey 
you ok 
monique was looking for you 
why do you even date her  anyway 
she s hot  it s a guy thing 
but she s so awful 
hey  you know 
you could use the front door 
and mom can t see me 
she thinks i m staying at dad s 
dad thinks i m at mom s 
in two days they both think
i m going away to school 
  that is the beauty of divorce 
  where are you going 
london for a couple of weeks 
as in london  england 
yeah  my band got a slot
in a music festival there 
ok  what are you gonna do about school 
yeah  i was kind of hoping
you could help me with that 
could you just  like  pretend to be mom 
call illyria  tell them i m sick 
something that sounds like it
would last for two weeks  like mad cow 
sebastian  you just got kicked out
of cornwall for skipping 
this is not exactly the way
you want to start out 
i want to be a musician 
last time i heard 
they don t need to know trigonometry 
besides 
if you want to chase your dreams 
sometimes you gotta
break the rules  right 
you know the percentage of bands
that make it to the big time 
probably the same
as female soccer players 
i will see you in two weeks 
sebastian 
  sebastian

you re back by the 12th 
it was so cool  vi 
we went on a couple days early

did one of my songs acoustically 
  they went nuts for my lyrics 
  oh  that s so cool 
and you were right about monique 
she s history 
  she really is  isn t she 
  i got to go  i ll talk to you later 
ok  bye 
trouble with your wig  hastings 
no  i actually   
i have a scalp condition 
  no  you don t 
  yeah  i do 
i really do 
it s really acting up during the   
no  you don t 
you ve got male pattern baldness 
scoot over  kiddo 
i don t know if you ve realized 
but recently i ve started
to thin out myself 
i ve tried all the creams
and the butters 
and i still can t seem to stop
mother nature s vindictive fury 
and neither can you 
there s gonna be a time
when you ll have to come out
of the closet and just
accept yourself for who you are 
a baldy  ok 
but it s gonna be all right  ok 
oh  and between you and me 
chicks dig it 
hang ten  yeah 
hi  olivia  i don t want you
to be worried  but malvolio s missing 
  oh  no 
  yeah 
if you see him  don t feed him 
he has an irritable bowel 
yeah   cause that
would be my very first instinct 
to feed the tarantula 
here s a wild idea 
have you ever thought
about going out with duke orsino 
i see that 
  duke 
  yeah 
  no 
  yeah 
  no 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  no 
i mean 
he s good looking and everything 
but he s just not the guy for me 
i don t know 
think there may be more to him
than you think there is 
so you re telling me
he s not just another dumb jock
who wants to hook up with me so
he could tell his friends  but too 
  insecure to treat you as an equal 
  exactly 
tell me about it 
you re the first guy at school
who hasn t tried anything with me 
trust me  you re not my type 
well  why not 
you know  it s just   
   i don t think of you in that way 
we re friends  you know 
you re actually one
of the few people here
that i feel comfortable around 
i feel the same way about you 
good  then just take my advice 
go out with duke 
i ll consider it 
so  what is that exactly 
i think that s the spleen 
ok  who s your daddy 
i got her to agree to consider you 
you re halfway in 
all right  ok  so should i ask her out 
no  you don t want to freak her out 
you got to have
a casual conversation first  hello 
why do i get the feeling
you don t do this very often 
man  i just   
i m not really good at talking to girls 
  why  you re hot 
  what 
you know  you re an appealing guy   
man    guy    guy man 
look  i don t know 
i just always say the wrong   
i just always say the wrong thing 
ok  all right  come on  let s get up 
i want to try something  i ll act like
a girl  and you re going to talk to me 
do i have to 
yes  because i m viola 
  duke  nice to meet you 
  that was creepy 
you really just sounded
like a girl just then 
i used to imitate
my sister all the time 
i got really good at it 
come on  and get up 
come on  ask me some questions 
and if the chemistry s right 
things ll just start flowing 
  questions about what 
  anything  ask me if   
   i like   
   cheese 
ok  do you like cheese 
why  yes i do  my favorite s gouda 
  i like gouda too 
  see

  we re flowing 
we re talking about cheese 
so what  flow is flow 
what  what s that 
what is that   it touched me 
it touched me 
it s malcolm s tarantula  get it 
  you get it

the bigger guy

i was just thinking that 
if you liked her then   
   maybe you should ask her out 
and just  i don t know 
forget about olivia 
well  i mean 
speaking as a completely objective
third party outsider with absolutely
no personal interest in the matter 
i am not sure that you and olivia
really mesh well together 
you know  i mean   
but you and viola   
   i mean   
   be magic 
i don t know 
what does your heart tell you 
i mean  which one would you
rather see naked  
why do you  why 
why do you always do that 
why do you always talk about girls
in such graphic terms 
you know what  you    you have issues 
you re a really sensitive guy 
aren t you 
what  no  no  it s just   
i don t know  i just think that
relationships should be more
than just the physical stuff 
don t get me wrong 
that stuff s important 
but when i m with someone 
i want to be able
to talk about other stuff 
like  i don t know  serious stuff 
stuff i can t talk about 
you know  with anyone else 
yeah  like   
   what kind of stuff 
i don t know  just stuff 
like  whatever stuff there is 
like    this kind of stuff

is for your ears only 
if you tell anyone  i ll kick your ass 
yeah  no

i know it s none of my business 
but you went out
with that duke orsino guy  right 
yeah  once 
  did you kiss him 
  no  why 
oh  no  it s nothing  but   
just try to postpone it
as long as possible 
he has this salivary gland condition 
yeah  he doesn t
really like to talk about it 
but it felt like i was drowning 
really 
  oh  my god 
  i know  it was repulsive 
but  hey  every happiness to you both 
no  actually  i don t really like duke 
i have this huge thing
for his roommate  sebastian 
and i was just trying
to make sebastian jealous 
oh  boy 
yeah  i know it s really wrong
to use a person this way 
and i feel really terrible about it 
but i really  really like sebastian 
he s so handsome 
not the goonish handsome
you see in a lot of guys 
he s a delicate  like 
even refined handsome  you know 
oh  and when he smiles 
i just can t stop looking at him 
he s just so wonderful 
you know  olivia   
  it s olivia  right 
  yeah 
i m gonna give you just a little advice 
  ok 
  enough is enough 
you are weaving a really tangled web 
like really  really tangled 
and  honey    you got to stop 
ok  so you just
gotta tell everybody the truth 
be very  very honest 
just let the chips fall where they may 
  you re right 
  i know 
the next time i see sebastian
i ll march right up to him 
  you march 
  and i ll tell him how i feel 
you tell him 
then i ll kiss him so passionately 
that even the people
he hates will feel pleasure 
hello  viola 
oh  this is not good 
and hello to you 
you little homewrecker 
  who are you 
  i am sebastian s girlfriend 
ex girlfriend 
ok  everybody s got to stop saying that 
you were the one he dumped
in the pizza parlor the other day 
no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
he did not dump me 
we re just going through
a little bit of a rough patch 
i heard he dumped you 
he dumped you big 
it was just like a big  huge dumping 
are you crazy   are you ok 
get out 
you are messing with the wrong man 
get off me  get off of me 
  get off of her 
  let go of me 
ladies  ladies  stop 
please 
when debutantes disagree
they say it with their eyes 
well  hastings 
why is it that i always find you
in the middle of a tussle 
bad timing 
i am convinced he s hiding something 
nonsense  malcolm 
he may be a little lost and confused 
but deep down he s an all american 
red blooded male 
  just like yourself 
  mom  i will pick out
my own dress 
and no  i will not wear heels 
because heels are a male invention
designed to make
a woman s butt look smaller 
and to make it harder
for them to run away 
malcolm  have you ever tried
to run away in high heels 
  no  sir  i wouldn t   
  not that easy  not that easy 
don t forget your guitar  mr  hastings

to be the exact opposite 
  what are you talking about 
  you re gonna sit there
and act like you don t know
what i m talking about 
and act like you don t know
what i m talking about 
ok 
all right  ok 
i wanted to tell you  duke  but   
   you have to know   
   i love soccer more
than anything else in the world 
and i had a point to prove 
what   so you re telling me
that you used me
to help you with soccer 
and then you turn around
and stab me in the back 
wait  what  now i really don t know
what you re talking about 
save it  man  i saw you with her 
  with who  
  who   olivia  that s who 
  you kissed when you got out the cab

  you don t know the meaning 
  olivia never liked you  ok  
she was just using you
to make me jealous 
but viola  she s crazy about you 
since the first moment
that you kissed her 
i bet that s part of your plan  distract
me so you can move in to olivia

that s what we call it in the states 
  sebastian  are you ok 
  no  olivia  not now 
try to tell me again
there s nothing going on 
there is nothing going on 
  what about last night 
  i didn t lie to you  duke 
i did  but not about this 
here s the truth 
i love you 
i beg your pardon 
what  all right    what re you 
that s just a little weird 
ok  you know what 
i can t do this anymore 
everybody  i have something to tell you 
i m not sebastian 
i m viola 
wait  you re not viola 
  yes  i am 
  no  i know viola 
  i    i kissed viola 
  you kissed me 
what are you talking about 
i didn t kiss you 
the girls team at cornwall got cut 
the guys wouldn t let me
go out for their team 
so i ve been pretending
to be my brother
while he was in london
for the past two weeks   
   so i could make the team
and beat cornwall 
but my brother came home early 
and that s who you saw kissing olivia
and that s who played the first half 
because you wear a wig
doesn t prove you re a girl 
ok  then 
merciful jesus 
yeah 
  viola  
  is it just me
or this soccer game
have more nudity than most 
all right  so everybody understand 
  yeah  i get it 
  ok 
wait a minute  if i kissed your brother 
where is he 
probably halfway to china  he
showed his willis and doodleberries   
  present 
  hi 
what the 
ok  this is freaking me out 
ladies and gentlemen  i hate
to say  i told you so   but i just   
see  duke  i didn t betray you 
i m sorry 
this isn t how i wanted it to happen 
and i didn t want to hurt you 
but i just wanted to prove
that i was good enough 
all i m asking for is a chance 
duke 
it s just like what coach says
before every game 
 be not afraid of greatness 
some are born great 
some achieve greatness 
and some have greatness
thrust upon them  
i think the best chance for us to be
great here today is to have you play 
  yeah 
  all right 
yeah  yeah  no 
no playing 
you have to forfeit 
there s no girls in this league 
look in the manual 
what manual 
listen  pal  you re in illyria 
we don t discriminate based on gender 
all right 
that s gonna bruise 
fine  you really think you can beat us
with a girl on your team 
this should be fun 
go

sorry 
  hi 
  hi 
so  what brings you here 
well  a few days ago 
i kissed this girl at a kissing booth 
and now i just can t seem
to stop thinking about it 
neither can she 
plus  i miss my roommate 
i really liked him 
well   
   he s right in here 
listen  i know i should ve
told you who i was  but   
   i was afraid 
  sorry 
  well 
you know  maybe
if i d have known you were a girl 
we wouldn t have talked like we did
and got to know each other
the same way 
and that would have been a shame 
just so you know 
everything you told me
when i was a guy just   
   made me like you
so much more as a girl 
ok  but just from here on in 
everything would just be a lot easier
if you stayed a girl 
i promise
