sorry  the second scene
of the first act 
second scene of the first act  right 
begin when you re ready 
yes  of course 
oh  sweetheart  do you know what
it was like waking up in paris   
   seeing the empty pillow where   
wait  cover your breasts  kevin is
downstairs  my god  what are you 
i m a woman  not felicia s mother 
not kevin s wife 
thanks very much 
we need someone a little older 
mom  dad  uncle pete  come quick 
something s wrong with biscuit 
i think he s dead 
we re looking for someone younger 
 they have dinner     can i start again 
i didn t get kicked off right 
the reading was fine 
you re the wrong height 
i can be taller

for somebody shorter 
look  i don t have to be this tall 
see  i m wearing lifts 
i can be shorter 
i know  but we re looking
for somebody different 
i can be different 
we re looking for somebody else 
what do you care more
about than working 
the part s the most important thing 
but love sometimes is too 
with improvisation  you re the writer 
when somebody writes a play   
   they decide where the highs are 
where the lows are  now you do it 
and you may not be high where
they re high in the writing 
you may not be low where they re low 
you may be high on  but  
you may be high on  and  
of course  they were doing it
for dough   
   the same as everybody
does it for dough 
but the question is in
the last analysis 
what were they doing for dough 
you and me were advancing our
little non prussian careers 
so when all hell broke loose 
and the germans ran out of soap   
   and figured   what the hell 
let s cook up mrs  greenwald     
   who the hell do you
think stopped them 
pardon me  is my acting
interfering with your talking 
don t play a part that s not in you 
don t say  he  or  she  like you did
last week when you were doing kitty 
when you were doing
time of your life 
if you can t make the part yourself 
you can t play it 
sergeant 
quick  get a priest 
no  sergeant  no priest 
  but you re dying  count tolstoy 
  i know 
in the name of the father 
the son and the holy ghost   
   i commit your soul to god 
  my friends   
  that s super  michael 
but i wonder if you could move center
stage on that speech  and then die 
why 
the left side of the house
can t see you 
you want me to stand up and walk
to the center of the stage   
   while i m dying 
i know it s awkward 
but we ll just have to do it 
  why 
  i just told you  now do it 
because you say so 
yes  love 
not with me as tolstoy 
you gotta work 
there s no excuse for not working 
there s no excuse 
there s unemployment 
there was unemployment when
my friends and i started acting 
and it s not changed 
you got 90 95  unemployment 
it s never going to change 
you re an actor 
you re in new york 
there is no work 
but you gotta find ways to work 
two tortellinis 
a gazpacho with two salads 
ordering  veal chop  medium 
two scrods  an order of chicken 
one scrod underdone 
  what s the rest 
  baked potato 
  how d it go 
  terrible 
  did you rewrite the last scene 
  i did the necktie scene

we ll work on it
when we get home tonight 
that s my flounder 
  that is my flounder 
  robber 
  ordering  one flounder   
  that s for the customer 
i eat these things so if the
customers ask if i eat his food   
   i can say   yeah  i eat his food  
you rewrote the necktie scene  good 
  without the necktie 
  with the necktie 
  with the necktie 
  yeah  with the necktie 
the necktie s wrong  you take the
necktie out  you got something 
  what s wrong with you 
  what s wrong with me 
what s wrong is it s depressing
to be disagreed with 
it s depression 
today s your birthday 
and you haven t mentioned it 
don t start  i m a character actor 
age has no effect on me 
  that s very good 
  how does one not be depressed 
instead of trying to be michael dorsey 
the great actor or the great waiter   
   why not just try to be
michael dorsey 
i am michael dorsey 
what s the payoff 
  say it like you mean it 
  i am michael dorsey  fine  okay 
surprise 
speech  speech  speech 
wait  wait  wait  wait  wait a minute 
first a toast 
to michael dorsey  who makes you
remember what acting s all about 
being unemployed 
to michael   
   who s been my friend for six years 
was it that long 
and who is my coach 
and he s just great 
he s a great coach  a great actor 
he s a great guy and

i want to be a waitress 
i wasn t gonna resort to this 
but you re gonna read 
excuse me  is terry bishop here 
no  mr  bishop is rehearsing
the iceman cometh for broadway 
he s what 
he s rehearsing the iceman cometh
for broadway 
that was my part 
i was supposed to be up   
i got to see somebody 
don t do anything rash 
will he be back

god    look what you   
margaret

i cut myself off 
what is it  michael 
terry bishop s doing iceman 
you promised to send me up for that 
you told me i d get a reading for that 
aren t you my agent 
  stuart pressman wants a name 
  terry bishop is a name 
michael dorsey is a name 
when you want to send a steak back 
wait  wait  wait 
you always do this to me 
it was a rotten thing to say 
let me start again 
terry bishop is on a soap 
millions watch him every day 
that qualifies him to ruin iceman 
i can act circles around him 
  i played that part in minneapolis 
  lf he wants a name  that s his affair 
people are in this business
to make money 
  i m in it to make money too 
  really 
the harlem theatre for the blind 
the people s workshop at syracuse 
wait a minute 
i did nine plays up at syracuse 
i got great reviews from the critics 
not that that s why i did it 
god forbid you should lose
your standing as a cult failure 
you think i m a failure 
i will not get sucked
into this conversation 
i will not 
i sent you my roommate s play to read 
it had a great part in it for me 
where do you come off sending me
a play for you to star in 
i m not your mother 
i don t find plays for you to star in 
i field offers 
that s what i do 
who told you that 
the agent fairy 
i could be terrific in that part 
  nobody s going to do that play 
  why 
it s a downer about a couple
that move back to love canal 
but that actually happened 
nobody wants to watch people
living next to chemical waste 
they can see that in jersey 
i don t want to argue about it 
i ll raise  8 000 and produce his play 
send me up for anything 
i don t care 
i ll do dog commercials 
i ll do radio voice overs 
  i can t put you up for that 
  why not 
because no one will hire you 
i bust my ass to get a part right 
and you bust everybody else s ass too 
who wants to argue about
whether tolstoy can   
   walk when he s dying
or walk when he s talking   
that was two years ago 
and that guy s an idiot 
they can t all be idiots 
you argue with everybody 
you ve got one of the worst
reputations in this town 
nobody will hire you 
are you saying that nobody
in new york will work with me 
nobody in hollywood will either 
i can t even get you a commercial 
you played a tomato  and they went over
schedule because you wouldn t sit 
yes  it wasn t logical 
you were a tomato  a tomato
doesn t have logic  it can t move 
so if he can t move 
how s he going to sit down 
i was a stand up tomato 
a juicy  sexy  beefsteak tomato 
nobody does vegetables like me 
i did vegetables off broadway 
i did the best tomato 
the best cucumber 
i did an endive salad that knocked
the critics on their ass 
i m trying to stay calm here 
you are a wonderful actor 
thank you 
but you re too much trouble 
get some therapy 
okay  thanks  i m gonna raise
 8 000 to do jeff s play 
michael  you re not
gonna raise 25 cents 
no one will hire you 
oh  yeah 
dorothy michaels 
  yes 
  george fields is your agent 
  yes 
  okay  ladies 
please bring your pages
and follow me 
i hate this line 
 you have every right to happiness  
this is dorothy michaels 
our director  ron carlysle 
that s our producer  rita marshall 
george fields is dorothy s agent 
that s impressive 
i m afraid you re not right for
this role  thanks for coming by 
page 205  you want camera one or two 
  camera two  and tell art 
  why am i not right 
i m trying to make
a certain statement   
   and i m looking for
a specific physical type 
mr  carlysle  i m a character actress 
i can play it any way you want 
i m sure you re a very good actress 
it s just that you re not
threatening enough 
not threatening enough 
take your hands off me or
i ll knee you in the balls 
  is that enough of a threat 
  it s a start 
i think i know what you want 
you want a caricature of a woman 
to prove some point like
power makes a woman masculine   
   or masculine women are ugly 
well  shame on any woman
that lets you do that 
and that means you  miss marshall 
shame on you  you macho shithead 
jesus 
what is idiotic about power
making a woman masculine 
not that that was my point 
miss michaels  just a minute 
was that for real
or were you auditioning 
which answer will get me
a reading  miss marshall 
well  good for you 
come 
  miss michaels 
  yes  oh  thank you 
you really think she s worth testing 
she told me no director had ever
communicated a part to her so fast 
she said that 
i like her   
   accent 
  i gotta get these back in order 
  they won t know the difference 
i m a little nervous 
just think of them
as something friendly 
like a firing squad 
miss michaels  we re going to
do a camera test now 
let me have a right profile  camera 1 
camera 3  a left profile 
what side 
left side

wait  what are you talking about 
my left 
your left 
miss michaels  nobody s talking to you 
i m sorry 
i thought you wanted my profile 
  not so close on camera 3 
  camera 3  back off 
make her look a little more attractive 
how far can you pull back 
  how do you feel about cleveland

you re getting older  you don t have
a man  so you want to act like one

that is inappropriate behavior 
i m proud of being a woman 
dr  brewster 
i m proud of this hospital 
and you should be too 
and i must tell you  before i let it
be destroyed by your petty tyrannies   
   by your callous inhumanities  sir

you be turned out into the street 
good day  dr  brewster 
i said good day  sir

you re delirious 
you think she s anthea 
  mr  carlysle  i

a little more hammering here  
now  when you grab her 
maybe you even say   anthea  anthea  
good  is my violin somewhere

the violin fell through the ice 
he was playing during the thaw 
you re dorothy michaels  aren t you

we re up next 
when he grabs you 
you ve got to be torn  to struggle 
you know you ve got to get those
tubes stuck back up his nose 
but you also realize
you re in the arms of a man   
   whose music was everything to anthea 
it was her whole life 
this is a man who stood by you
after ted s breakdown 
get me a bagel and cream cheese 
  julie  you want anything 
  no  she s fine  thanks 
so it s a struggle  but you re
struggling with yourself as well 
  and i lose  right 
  get down here a minute

comes down to her knees   
   it inflames your desire 
god knows  it inflames mine 
okay  big john 
dorothy  come in here 
this is dorothy michaels 
the new hospital administrator 
hello  dorothy 
hi  we met the other day 
julie nichols  hospital slut

we can t even rehearse 
i m gonna show you your marks 
and then we ll go straight to tape 
big john  you ll enter from here 
you see them struggling   
   you cross to here and cry loudly 
 nurse charles  are you insane  
yes  i see  will it be
on the teleprompter   loudly  
and who do i say that to 
nurse charles 
i thought when dr  brewster   
you will enter from here 
cross to this mark 
i know my mark 
but i thought   
the corridor scene will be played
right here  right 
see  i just wanted to ask
concerning the doctor   
places  please 
stand by  tape is rolling 
five  four  three   
anthea

nurse charles  tend to your patient
and faint on your own time 
  yes  miss   
  kimberly 
dr  brewster   
   you and i must talk 
  rita  you want to keep rolling 
  it s okay  the girl saved it 
  you haven t changed  emily 
  but i have  medford 
you know  emily  there s no reason
for us to be in opposite camps 
we can rule southwest general together 
i admire people with power 
women with power  especially 
god  she hit him on the head 
rita  she hit him 
  and not consider it a threat 
i m afraid that you have
underestimated me 
if you want to win me over 
you ll deal with my mind   
   and not my lips 
  cut it 
  and stop tape 
  i was supposed to kiss her 
  it was just an instinct 
remember what you said about
being more threatening 
it was a good instinct 
it would ve been mine 
wait  i ll handle the instincts here 
it happened to be a good
instinct  toots 
but next time you want to change
something  discuss it with me first 
yes  i was wrong not to 
good girl 
big john  wonderful 
all right  people 
item seven  in the corridor 
thanks for catching me 
you saved my ass  literally 
dorothy   
   i just want to say i loved what you

exhilarating first day

  good night 
julie  come on  baby 
can we drop you 
maybe you d like to join us for a drink 
  no  thanks  i feel like walking 
  okay  bye 
she s a very attractive girl 
and no dummy 
but for the life of me   
   i cannot understand why she
hangs around with that director 
he treats her like she s just   
   nothing 
i think you re right 
i m rewriting the necktie scene
without the necktie 
he s condescending 
he calls me  sweetheart  
he doesn t even know my name 
he calls her  baby  
he pushed me around  if not for
the dress  i d have kicked his ass 
how d you communicate with him 
he told me what he wanted 
i didn t say anything 
i did it my way  he bawled me out 
i apologized  that was that 
i think dorothy s smarter than i am 
i just wish i looked prettier 
i look in the mirror and   
maybe i can just get a softer   
   hair or something 
because she deserves it 
  don t answer that 
  why not 
  it could be for dorothy  please 
  why d you give them this number 
the show has to contact me
in case they change the schedule 
i ll find out 
they can t think dorothy lives
with a man  it s wrong for her 
it could be for me 
answer as dorothy 
i can t 
what if it s sandy 
if it s diane  how do i
explain there s a woman here 
i ll get a service tomorrow 
when you were playing cyrano and you
stuck a saber in my armpit   
   i didn t say anything 
when you were hopping around 
ranting about your hump   
   saying this was a bell tower 
i didn t say anything 
but i don t see why i should
pretend i m not home   
   just because you re not
that kind of girl 
that s weird 
  where are you going 
  to diane s 
that way if anybody wants to reach me 
they can talk to me 
what do you think i m doing this for 
for you  for the play  for sandy   
i told you to give me
the pain yesterday 
sandy  i m sorry 
i can t talk long 
i just don t have the energy 
i didn t forget 
i just may have the flu 
do you have a fever 
how much  go right to bed
and take two aspirin   
   bundle up  sweat  and drink liquids 
above all  take 1000 units of
vitamin c every hour with milk only 
did you give melanie
an overdose on purpose 
i don t know 
i don t write the shit  you know 
don t be so hard on dr  brewster 
he s insecure 
i have to be tough 
he just wants my body 
dorothy  you re so bad 
  you look just the way you look 
  thank you  you re very attractive too 
i want you to meet my dad  les 
  it s nice to meet you 
  i feel i know you already 
i just love your daughter to pieces 
i can t write any clearer
than i can write  it s in english 
  what about those 
  for sandy 
for me  for dorothy  not exactly 
but that kind of idea 
  a little overstated 
  really  wait a minute 
jesus 
  that s her 
  mr  earl 
you got it 
thursday  what time 
8 30 
i will not forget 
okay  bye bye 
 things are better since you
came to southwest general  
   we re so grateful to you  
  for 
   for your help and advice  
   i think of you all as my daughters  
 what kind of mother wouldn t
give her girls tits  
 tips  
it s  tips  
tips 
you ll find you picked
the wrong man to challenge 
it was you who pro   
look at me when i talk to you 
i don t trust a man
who won t meet my eye 
i don t trust it in a bank teller
or a salesman 
and i certainly don t trust it
in a chief surgeon 
you provoked this confrontation 
you re an incredibly
insensitive woman 
stop thinking of me as a woman
and start thinking of me as a person 
that s what southwest general
is made of  people 
and have nurse charles
see me immediately 
  push in for a close up 
  not too close 
okay  hold it there 
  and cut it 
  stop tape 
dorothy  it was wonderful
the way you held my face 
you controlled me completely 
thank you  but you had
some great moments 
hold it  good news  children 
our brilliant engineers have
again erased a reel of the show 
so we have to retape
14  15 and 16 
it s either that
or do it live  tomorrow 
i think we should tape it 
that s a wrap  see you bright
and early  6 30 tomorrow 
  good night  dorothy 
  good night  ben 
that s some day  huh 
what  oh  you mean about
doing it over again 
tell me  does that happen often 
every once in a while 
we actually had to do it live once 
live 
you should have seen van horn s face 
he was so panicked   
   we had to shoot him from the back 
  want some wine 
  no  thanks  i better go home 
i have to wash my hair 
thanks anyway 
  dorothy 
  yes 
listen  i know this is exactly
what you want to hear now   
   but we ve got 26 pages 
and i was wondering   
   if you could come over and
run some lines with me tonight 
i could make you something to eat 
night  fay 
i m a born defroster 
you don t have a thing to wear 
  she s seen me in all these 
  not in the white thing 
what  this  you cannot wear white
to a casual dinner  it s too dressy 
  you couldn t wear pants 
  no  pants  i can t 
  what about this 
  no shoes for it 
the lines make me look hippy   
   and it cuts me across the bust 
we re getting into a weird area 
this is smart 
what about this 
looks like you should
ring a school bell 
this may seem silly to you 
but this is our first date 
i want to look pretty for her 
hi 
what a pretty outfit 
  glad you like it 
  come on in 
  brought you something 
  you didn t have to 
it wasn t nothing 
come in 
i ll put them in water 
what a big apartment 
  what a lovely  lovely room 
  is it 
  yes  it s yummy 
  i had a decorator do it 
before  no money 
now  no time 
  amy is asleep  finally 
  scared the daylights out of me 
miss nichols  that child is never
going to learn anything if you keep   
thank you  mrs  crawley 
  dorothy  mrs  crawley 
  i m sorry  i didn t know 
nice meeting you 
  scares the shit out of me 
  scared me to death 
drop your coat here 
  who is it 
  amy s nanny 
and she hates me 
who s amy 
my daughter 
she was 14 months old last week 
i didn t know you had a baby 
you got any kids  dorothy 
  were you ever married 
  i haven t been that fortunate 
i was engaged once  though 
to a brilliant young actor   
   whose career was cut short by
the theatrical establishment 
  they killed him 
  so to speak 
sutton gave up acting  and me as well 
he s working now as a waiter
in a disreputable restaurant 
i don t want to talk about it 
maybe you d like some wine 
no  i think i d better keep sharp
when we work  you know 
you mind if i ask you a question 
do you worry about using so much
heavy makeup on your skin 
i don t worry 
i have a little   
   moustache problem i m sensitive to 
probably just too many
male hormones or something 
some men find that attractive 
i know  i know  i just don t like
the men that find it attractive 
so you re divorced 
i ve never been married 
perhaps i ll have
one little drink 
tell me about ron 
  how much time have you got 
  go on 
well  ron   
ron is  hands down  the best
director of daytime drama 
did they tell you
not to call it a soap yet 
if anybody calls it a soap opera 
rita fines them a quarter 
it s how she got her car 
you re not telling me
about you and ron 
that s nighttime drama 
he s interesting there too 
oh  you mean he s   
you mean you have a good relationship 
what s a good relationship  dotty 
can i call you dotty 
  oh  please do 
  ron s smart and he s funny 
we got things in common 
you know a guy who wants a woman
who eats at four   
   is unconscious by nine
and works at dawn 
but how does he treat you 
oh  that 
  you think i do this without a plan 
  what do you mean 
there are a lot of men out there 
i m selective  i look around carefully 
when i find the one who can
give me the worst time   
   that s when i make my move 
my lines sound like subtitles
for a czech movie 
try answering as if the question
took you by surprise 
what do you mean 
i ll ask a question 
you just answer it 
why do you drink so much 
when you grow up as i did  an orphan
raised by a sister 16 years older   
   you have few illusions 
  there you go 
  it made a difference 
you got it 
thanks  dorothy 
why do you drink so much 
because it s not fattening   
   and it s not good for me 
how many things can you say that about 
you telling me to mind
my own business 
i just don t think you
should worry about it 
  it s nice of you  but   
  but i should mind my own business 
it s all so complicated  isn t it 
  what 
  all of it 
don t you find being a woman
in the  80s complicated 
extremely 
  you know what i wish  just once 
  what 
that a guy could be honest enough
to walk up to me and say   
    hey  i m confused about this too 
i could lay a big line on you 
we could do lots of role playing   
   but the simple truth is 
i find you very interesting   
   and i d really like to make love
with you   simple as that 
  wouldn t that be a relief 
  heaven 
sheer heaven 
ron was supposed to come over
last night  i had dinner all ready 
he never showed up 
oh  my lord 
what time is it 
it s 10 30 
i gotta go 
listen  forgive me for rushing off 
it was a wonderful dinner 
the dinner is burned 
i m sorry i m late 
but i was taking a shower   
   and the water turned off   
   and i got soap in my eyes 
i had to go to five stores to get
chocolate chocolate chip 
michael  i saw her 
what  you saw who 
when you were late 
i went by your place 
i waited outside and i saw that
fat woman go into your apartment 
fat woman 
the one in the raincoat 
oh  that woman 
that s a friend of jeff s 
she came over to help him
with the play 
they ve known each other for years 
you think she s fat 
well  it was dark but  yes 
i thought she was fat 
when did jeff start
collaborating on his play 
she s an excellent typist 
look  i m not having
an affair with that woman 
it s impossible 
i don t want to make trouble 
i shouldn t have people over 
they never show up 
i m sorry  i feel guilty 
you feel guilty  i m sorry 
don t do that  don t apologize
because i m three hours late 
you should be furious 
you ve been great to me 
you helped me with the audition
for that soap  it s that soap 
that soap 
did you see that cow they hired 
cow 
they must ve gone a different way 
she is awful 
well  i heard she was pretty good 
baloney 
she s supposed to be tough  right 
she s not tough 
she s a wimp 
maybe it s the lines 
she doesn t make them up 
well  i think she should 
they couldn t be any worse 
i can t move out  miss kimberly 
i have no place to go 
i don t know what to do 
don t tell me your husband beats you 
but you can t move out 
  why should you move 
  what is she saying 
three s up  ready one 
you know what i d do
if somebody did this to me 
i d pick up the biggest thing
around and i d just   
   bash their brains
right through   
   the top of their skull before
i d let them beat me up again 
well  i can t afford therapy 
miss kimberly 
who said anything about therapy 
  cut it  ron 
  cut it 
wait a minute  her line is
 your husband    
wait a second 
may i say in my own defense   
   to tell a woman
with two children  no money   
   and a husband who beats
her up like this   
   to move into a welfare center
to get therapy is a lot of   
   horseshit 
i wouldn t do it  would you 
  i can t act with this 
  oh  shut up 
ron 
i m partially to blame  miss kimberly 
i know i m pretty  and i use it 
i guess i shouldn t have gone
to dr  brewster s office so late 
no  that s not true 
dr  brewster has tried to seduce
several nurses on this ward   
   claiming to be in the throes
of an uncontrollable impulse 
do you know what 
i m going to give every nurse
on this floor an electric cattle prod   
   and instruct them to just zap
him in his  badubies  
cattle prod 
ruby  hi  do you want to
open up the yellow pages   
   under the section
of farm equipment   
i am dorothy  nobody s writing her 
it s coming out of me 
you re michael acting dorothy 
it s the same thing 
i m experiencing these feelings 
why can t you get me a special 
i feel i have something to say to women 
  you have nothing to say to women 
  i have plenty to say to women 
i ve been an unemployed
actor for 20 years 
i know what it s like to wait
for the phone to ring 
then when i finally get a job 
i have no control  i got zip 
if i could impart that experience
to other women   
there are no other women
like you  you re a man 
yes  i realize that  of course 
but i m also an actress 
  we shouldn t argue about this 
  i m a potentially great actress 
i could do medea  ophelia  lady macbeth 
just like in shakespeare s day 
get the writers at the agency   
i could do a great eleanor roosevelt 
we can do the
eleanor roosevelt story 
the eleanor roosevelt story 
what s the matter with that 
phil weintraub s party is saturday

mike dorsey

role playing  but the simple truth   
   is that i find you
very interesting 
and i d like to make love to you 
you know 
it s as sim   
as simple as that

  how can you keep lying to sandy 
  it s for her own good 
i never told sandy i wouldn t
see other women  come on 
if i told her  it would hurt her

a few too many 
hard liquor 
they thought they saw this elk

i m not that militant

i m all for equality 
women ought to be entitled to

i must keep my wits tonight 
tonight 
well  always 
i remember years ago   
   there wasn t talk about
what a woman was  what a man was 
you just were what you were 
now they have all this stuff about
being like the other sex   
   so you can all be the same 
well  i m sorry  but we re just not 
not on a farm  anyway 
bulls are bulls 
and roosters don t try to lay eggs 
never 
my wife and i  we were
married a lot of years 
people got it all wrong 
they say your health
is the most important thing 
but i can lift this house off the
ground  what good is it 
being with someone 
sharing 
that s what it s all about 
  julie says you re not married 
  no 
like another drink 
  no 
  you sure 
yes  well  you know what 
i think it is about that time 
  thanks for staying up and talking 
  don t you mention it 
you have beautiful eyes 
oh  well  thank you 
good night  les 
daddy s a little out of
touch  isn t he 
no  very sweet  very sweet 
he sees things pretty simply 
you re either happy or unhappy 
married or not married 
there s nothing in between 
i tried to get him to take out
other women after mama died but   
you know  she must have been
a very special person 
i guess so 
i don t remember her very well 
i remember her helping me
pick out this wallpaper 
i d chosen one with great big 
purple flowers on it 
and she said to me   
    just remember that once
you choose it   
   it s gonna cover the walls
of your room for a long  long time  
so i tried to imagine what those big 
purple flowers would look like   
   on all the walls of my room   
   every night when i was
falling asleep   
   and every morning
when i was getting dressed 
so i said to her 
 which one would you choose  mom  
and she said   the one with
the daisies and the little rosebuds   
   because daisies
are such homey flowers   
   and rosebuds are so cheerful
and always waiting to bloom  
that s lovely 
i made a million plans
looking at this wallpaper 
i was always waiting
for these rosebuds to open 
that s nice 
my mother used to do that too 
sometimes 
  good night  julie 
  good night  dottie 
cathy campbell 
please call your office 
it says  cool  
don t you think i should be angry 
doesn t it play better 
yes  why don t you try that 
this just came to
our dressing room for you 
  i think it s from julie s father 
  oh  my 
now don t you dare eat any 
you don t want to ruin your cute figure 
what a thoughtless present
to give a woman 
chocolates 
dorothy michaels 
rita marshall s office 
you re a complicated lady 
on the one hand 
you re a real pain in the ass 
i ve got one of the most
expensive directors in soaps   
i owe myself a quarter 
and you ve got him
defensive and hostile 
i don t mean to 
however  we re getting
2000 letters a week   
   and we ve picked up
three share points 
and it s largely due to you 
you are the first woman character
who is her own person 
who asserts her own personality
without robbing someone of theirs 
you re a breakthrough lady for us 
we re picking up your option for
another year  congratulations 
come on  mike  what do you mean 
get you out of it 
there s no way out 
it s their option 
what  who gave them that 
you signed the standard contract 
but i didn t know i d be working
for the rest of my life as a woman 
you gotta make it work 
they ll pay  they ll go from
650 to 850 an episode 
you get me out of this 
or i ll go in and tell them 
tell them what 
that you put a network on the spot 
you re making a fool out of women 
they ll kill you 
my secretary wants to be like
dorothy michaels  i want to fire her 
we re talking major fraud here 
major fraud  you can t tell them 
what about me  you think anybody
will believe i wasn t in on this 
it s not just ruining yourself 
this is ruining me too 
you can t do it 
you gotta make it work 
  can you take that many valium 
  we ll see 
maybe your contract has
a morals clause 
if dorothy did something filthy or
disgusting  they d let you go 
but you ve already done everything
filthy and disgusting on your show 
dorothy  it s julie 
there s sort of an emergency 
well  it s not really an emergency   
   but if you get a chance 
would you call me 
  are you sure you wanna do this 
  no  but i m going to 
i ve been fooling myself about ron
for too long now 
i guess i really wanted you here
for moral support 
although i did fire mrs  crawley today 
i really did 
  want a drink 
  i m not the one breaking up with ron 
i d buy a ticket to that 
you have influenced me though 
i ve seen ron through your eyes 
julie  i don t want
that responsibility 
why shouldn t you influence me 
you wouldn t compromise your
feelings like i have   
   or live this kind of lie 
well  no  i wouldn t 
but   
of course not  and you re right 
it s just   
i deserve something better 
i don t have to settle for this 
but i ve always been too lazy
or too scared or too something 
don t be so hard on yourself 
what the hell 
i ll live  won t i 
maybe not happily  but honestly 
sounds like something you d say 
you mustn t idealize me  honesty 
in many ways  is a relative term 
my father s coming 
if he calls  don t say
anything about this 
he s coming tonight 
he ll want to see you 
me 
oh  god 
it s ron 
oh  dorothy  god bless you 
wish me luck now 
always 
i feel that little moustache 
you should put some makeup on it 
how re you doing 
what s going on 
dorothy s gonna sit with amy 
  i ll be right back 
  okay 
hi  honey 
you don t mind if i call you honey
when we re not working 
nice dress 
thank you 
you don t like me  do you 
i can respect that   
   but there s not many women
i can t make like me 
why don t you like me 
i don t like
the way you treat julie 
oh 
i don t like the way you patronize her 
deceive her and lie to her 
what do you mean 
you want me to go on 
no  i know what you mean 
look  i never promised julie i d be
exclusive and not see other women 
but i know she doesn t want
me to see them   
   so i lie to her
to keep from hurting her 
that s very convenient 
no  wait a minute 
look at it from my side 
see  if a woman
wants me to seduce her   
   i usually do 
but then she pretends i promised her
something  then i pretend i did 
in the end  i m the one
that s exploited 
bullshit  ron 
you know what 
i understand you a lot better
than you think i do 
really 
i m ready 
  julie s ready 
  she sure is 
dorothy  she never wakes up 
but if she does 
there s applesauce in the fridge 
give her a couple spoonfuls 
i m sure she   
are you sure you ll be okay 
don t be silly  how much trouble

  i went to six stores for your favorite 
  chocolate covered cherries 
that s sweet 
oh  and a card 
oh  yeah  no  no 
don t  don t read it 
i was very angry when i wrote that 
 thank you for the lovely night
in front of the fire 
missing you  les  
this isn t for me 
it s another girl s candy 
i wouldn t give you
another girl s candy 
  then  whose is it 
  mine 
a guy named les sends you candy 
yes  he s a friend of mine 
he can t eat candy  he s diabetic 
why is he thanking you for
a lovely night in front of the fire 
my mind s a blank 
are you gay 
in what sense 
just be honest with me 
for once in your life tell the truth 
because these stories
are very demeaning to me 
no matter how bad the truth is   
   it doesn t tear you apart inside
like dishonesty 
at least it leaves you with
some self respect and some dignity 
you re right 
okay  okay 
i m not gonna lie to you anymore 
i m gonna tell you the truth 
sandy   
i m in love with another woman 
what are you saying  
  sandy  please  don t   
  you liar 
we never said  i love you  
  we went to bed one time 
  i don t care 
you re a dear friend  but let s not
pretend it was something else 
we re gonna lose everything 
i don t care about  i love you  
i read the second sex   
   and the cinderella complex 
i m responsible for my own orgasms 
i just don t like to be lied to 
you asked me
to be straight with you 
i didn t say
how i d feel about it 
  what can i do 
  there s nothing you can do for me 
i just have to feel like this   
   and you have to know
you made me feel this way 
  aren t we still friends 
  no 
i don t take this shit from friends 
only from lovers 
  wait  what about the play 
  what about it 
i should tell you to shove your play 
but i won t  because
i never allow personal despair   
   to ruin my
professional commitments 
i am a professional actress 
so  are these real
chocolate covered cherries 
i think so 
  see you at rehearsal 
  oh  sandy   
don t call me 
it s 2 a m 
can t this wait 
i don t care 
get me off this show in 10 days 
  it s impossible 
  then i m getting a new agent 
you hurt my feelings 
what happened 
i told her about julie 
she thinks i m gay 
  julie thinks your gay 
  no  my friend sandy 
well  sleep with her 
  i did and she still thinks i m gay 
  oh  that s not so good 
i gotta get back to my life 
you got lots of lawyers   
   there must be a way to get
me out of this show 
  we ve been through this 
  why can t dorothy have an accident 
we can use our imaginations 
this isn t too tough 
kill somebody and bring back the stiff 
but she d better look like you 
  they don t miss a trick 
  these are nice  good people 
since when do you care so much
about what other people feel 
you should have seen julie s face
when she thought i was a lesbian 
lesbian 
you just said  gay  
sandy thinks i m gay 
julie thinks i m a lesbian 
  i thought dorothy was straight 
  she is 
les  the sweetest man in the world 
asked me to marry him 
a guy named les
wants to marry you 
yeah 
no  wants to marry dorothy 
  he knows she s a lesbian 
  she s not 
  i know that  but does he 
  know what 
that   
well  i don t know 
you know he gave me a ring 
he gave me a diamond ring 
what did you say 
 i got to think it over  
i went in the ladies  room
and almost pissed in the sink 
thirteen s up 
ready 14 
widen e 
pull three to 130 
  cut it 
  stop tape 
we re gonna take
a short break  people 
hold it  hold it 
slight change of plans  children 
our future ex tape editor spilled
a bottle of celery tonic   
   on the second reel
of the show airing today 
so we have to redo
emily s party scene  live 
  live 
  quick  like bunnies 
you have 26 minutes 
get into wardrobe 
  but rita   
  you ve only got a few lines 
well  i don t see
why we can t use the tape 
just because it s a little sticky 
explain to them that
the hours have to be flexible 
no   
and i would   
can i call you back 
thank you 
my god  dorothy  i just   
really  i can t 
it s for amy 
oh  thanks 
that s nice 
  i don t know how to say this   
  i wish you wouldn t 
i understand that you weren t able
to tell my dad last night 
so it d be better for all of us
if i tried to explain it to him 
look  i wouldn t be honest
if i didn t tell you   
   how much you ve meant to me
these past couple weeks 
you taught me how to stand up
for myself because you always do 
you taught me to stop hiding
and just be myself   
   because you re always yourself 
i m grateful to you 
but   
well  i just   
i just can t see you anymore 
you know 
i just feel it would be leading you on 
it wouldn t be fair to you 
i really love you  dorothy 
but i can t   
i can t love you 
places  everybody 
immediately 
fifteen seconds to commercial 
i don t care how you get there

five  four  three   
let s raise our glasses to our
guest of honor  ms  emily kimberly 
we re looking forward to having
you grace us with your presence   
   for many years to come 
thank you  gordon 
i can t tell you all how moved i am 
i never in my wildest dreams   
   imagined that i would be the object
of so much genuine affection 
it makes it more difficult for
me to say what i m now going to say 
i do feel it s time
to set the record straight 
i didn t come here
just as an administrator 
i came to this hospital
to settle a score 
what score 
my father built
this hospital 
but to his family   
   he was an unmerciful tyrant 
an absolute dodo bird 
oh  no  not live 
let s see where she goes 
he drove my mother to drink 
in fact  she went riding one time
and lost all her teeth 
what  what 
  the oldest daughter  the pretty 
charming one  became pregnant   
   at 15 and was driven
out of the house 
she was so terrified that her daughter
would bear the stigma of illegitimacy   
   she changed her name and contracted
a disfiguring disease   
   after moving to tangiers  where
she raised the girl as her sister 
but her one ambition   
any preference of shots
on this one 
  was to become a nurse 
so she returned to the states
and joined the staff right here   
   at southwest general 
she worked here
and had to speak out   
   wherever she saw injustice
and inhumanity 
don t you understand that 
dr  brewster 
i never laid a hand on her 
yes  you did  she was shunned
by all you nurses too 
give me something  one 
not backs 
two and three go left and right 
no  two go left 
three go right 
her outspokenness threatened
you doctors 
but she was deeply  deeply 
deeply loved   
   by her brother 
  her brother 
this brother 
on the day of her death   
   swore to the good lord above
he d follow in her footsteps 
and  and  and   
   just  just  just   
don t  don t  don t panic 
   owe it all up to her 
but on her terms 
here come the terms 
as a woman   
   and just as proud to be a woman   
   as she ever was   
   for i am not emily kimberly   
   the daughter of dwayne   
   and alma kimberly 
no  i m not 
i m edward kimberly 
anthea s reckless brother 
holy christ 
edward kimberly  who s finally
vindicated his sister s good name 
i m edward kimberly 
edward kimberly 
  i ll be damned 
  i m not mentally ill  but proud   
   and lucky to be the woman
that was the best part of my manhood 
the best part of myself 
that is one nutty hospital 
i knew there was a reason
she didn t like me 
cut it 
cut 
does jeff know 
hey  robert 
hi  les 
get him 
all right 
get him  get him  get him 
oh  come on 
  i thought you d want it back 
  outside 
give it to me outside 
why d you do it 
i needed the work 
the only reason you re still living is
because i never kissed you 
i hope you enjoyed the chocolates 
i gave them to a girl 
so did i  i thought 
do you like them 
  chocolates 
  girls 
i like julie 
i think i love julie 
wearing a dress is
a funny way to show it 
i know  i apologize 
the truth is 
you were okay company 
so were you 
i could have done
without the dancing 
you know  you re very good 
  i m seeing a real nice woman now 
  oh  really

and she misses you 
look  you don t know me from adam 
but i was a better man with you 
as a woman   
   than i ever was with a woman 
as a man 
you know what i mean 
i just gotta learn to do it
without the dress 
at this point  there might be
an advantage to my wearing pants 
the hard part s over 
you know
