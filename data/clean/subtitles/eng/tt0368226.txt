i still think
you should marry johnny
now you cant live on love
you need financial security
but im not happy
he still thinks
im gonna marry him next month
hes a fool
you expect to be happy
i havent been happy
since i married my first husband
i didnt even want
to marry your father
you never told me that
well its true
all men are assholes
men and women use and abuse each other
all the time theres nothing wrong with it
marriage has nothing
to do with love
johnnys okay i suppose
actually
i have him wrapped
around my little finger
you should be happy then
but i dont love him
dont throw your life away just
because you dont love him
thats ridiculous
