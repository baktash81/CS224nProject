do you have some advice 
it s a complicated
situation  johnny 
i mean  you re my friend  and i don t
wanna get between you and lisa 
but look  if you want to 
you should confront her 
i can t confront her 
i want to give her a second chance 
after all  she s my future wife 
you know what they say 
love is blind 
you got a lot of faith in lisa 
sometimes life gets complicated 
the unexpected can happen

women  man  women just confuse me 
i have a girl  but she s married 
she s very attractive 
it s just    it s driving me crazy 
why didn t you mention this before 
is it anyone i know 
  no  man  you don t know her

and we didn t make
love in a while   
and i don t know what to do 
you never really know  i mean

about your feelings  okay 
you shouldn t hide  em 
you two have been together forever 
  you can work out anything

king of the house 
you gotta establish these
guidelines before you get married 
how did you ever meet lisa

that s a very interesting story 
when i moved to san francisco with
two suitcases  i didn t know anyone 
i have i hit y m c a   
with a  2 000 check
which i couldn t cash 
  why not 
  well  because it was an out of state bank 
anyway  i was working
as a busboy in a hotel   
and  uh uh  she was sitting   
drinking her coffee 
she was so beautiful 
and i say  hi  to her

  bye 
  uh huh 
  hello  mom  how are you 
i m okay  how are you 
i m fixing the apartment for johnny s birthday 
but i m really not into it 
oh  why not 
 cause i m in love with mark 
not johnny 
and here i am planning his party 
it s not right  lisa 
i still think
you should marry johnny 
now  you can t live on love 
you need financial security 
but i m not happy 
he still thinks
i m gonna marry him next month 
he s a fool 
you expect to be happy 
i haven t been happy
since i married my first husband 
i didn t even want
to marry your father 
you never told me that 
well  it s true 
all men are assholes 
men and women use and abuse each other
all the time  there s nothing wrong with it 
marriage has nothing
to do with love 
johnny s okay  i suppose 
actually   
i have him wrapped
around my little finger 
you should be happy then 
but i don t love him 
don t throw your life away just
because you don t love him 
that s ridiculous 
you need to grow up 
and you need to listen to me 
okay 
mom  i ll see you at the party 
  i just need to be alone right now
