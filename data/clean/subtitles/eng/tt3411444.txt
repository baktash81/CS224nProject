you don t like
the bullfighting 
it s because you re hung up
on the blood

and the gore
and the senseless violence 
do you have a point 
my point is  it s about more
than just smashing heads 
it s about rhythm
and footwork and grace 
don t just think of it
as a fight 
think of it like a dance 
a bull dancing 
is this some kind
of hilarious joke
designed to make me laugh 
you see  horses 
we have the beautifulest legs
for the dancing 
bulls have short 
stubby legs 
yeah  look at me 
moo  moo  moo 
go eat a schnitzel 
you pasty faced glue stick 
it s okay  lupe 
they re right 
i mean  how could
a big  clumsy bull
ever do something like this 
whoo  check out my boy
cuttin  a rug 
yeah 
that was good 
you call that dancing  ha 
nein  this is dancing 
three against one
is hardly fair 
lupe  get my pipes
