all right  attaway 
you know  i think i actually
found something rare 
what 
  this plant  i think it s a grex 
  a what 
g r e x  that s when
two species cross pollinate
and produce a third
completely unique one 
and listen to this 
 epilobic  from the greek epi  upon 
and lobos  a pod  
 many of the species are dangerous
weeds and should be avoided  
dangerous 
in the garden 
see  look how quickly it roots 
 their rapid and widespread growth
was even observed
in many of the war torn cities of europe  
 lndeed  some of these plants
may thrive on devastated ground

my friend david kibner 
  the psychiatrist

put things into perspective 
  i m not crazy 
  no  no  no  i m serious 
he would eliminate whether geoffrey
was having an affair  or had become gay 
whether he had a social disease 
or had become a republican 
all the things that could have happened
to have made you feel he had changed 
d you know what i mean 
you wanna go see him

all recognising each other 
something was passing between them all 
some secret 
it s a conspiracy  i know it 
there can t be a conspiracy 
matthew  i m telling you 
something s going on here 
something that scares me 
i tried to see geoffrey today 
to talk to him 
he s always in his office in the morning 
it really was weird 
geoffrey was meeting
all sorts ofstrange people 
things were being passed between them 
  none were people you knew 
  i didn t know any of them 
maybe they were patients of geoffrey s 
oh  no  no  matthew  i know they weren t 
i followed him
from one end oftown to the other 
and everywhere he went he had
these meetings with strange people 
i felt so stupid
sneaking around spying on him 
but i can t talk to him  what can i do 
ok  well  kibner will be able
to explain something 
i don t need a psychiatrist 
just forget that he s a psychiatrist 
just think of him as an intelligent man 
which is what he is 
it s a book party  he s a celebrity 
he s very famous 
and you will like him 
if you forget that he s a psychiatrist 
i don t know    i don t know 
matthew  i ve lived in this city all my life 
but somehow today
i felt everything had changed 
people were different 
notjust geoffrey  but everybody 
yesterday it all seemed normal 
today everything seemed the same 
but it wasn t 
it was a nightmare 
it really became frightening 
it was like the whole city
had changed overnight 
did i ever tell you the one
about the english camel corps  did l 
they re trapped in the desert 
in the sahara desert 
they ve been surrounded by rommel
for 40 days and they ve run out of food 
and the captain comes
and makes an announcement to the men 
he says 
 men  i have some good news
and some bad news for you  
  one of the men says   
  wait  you have told me this 
can i tell it to you again 
look out 
oh  my god  lock the door 
  they re coming 
  we should help 
help  help  they re coming

  around the corner 
  elizabeth driscoll  jack bellicec 
  this is the elizabeth 
the book is awful  kibner s book is awful 
his ideas are garbage  pure garbage 
how can you say that
about a man like kibner 
not a man like kibner 
i m saying it about kibner 
he dashes a book off every six months 
takes me six months to write one line 
  why 
  cos i pick each word individually 
  what s so hot about that 
  i wasn t even talking to you  was l 
on the corner of leavenworth and   
  turk 
  turk  turk 
is that him 
yes 
yes 
 what s so hot about that 
what s so hot about that   i don t know   
you must have a report on it
cos there was a motorcycle officer there
  and an ambulance on the way 
  they follow me 
  they don t understand me 
  you don t have to prove yourself to them 
  that s easy for you to say 
  of course i saw it 
  the man was running down the street 
  it s romantic  sentimental 
  he landed on my car 
  post industrial nonsense 
just a second  i m talking to the police 
  no  he was bleeding on the road 
  what seems to be the trouble 
hello  yeah 
don t ever give your name to cops 
leavenworth and turk  i ll hold 
but he isn t my husband 
it s someone who looks like him 
he s an impostor 
now  katherine  he s your husband 
you know him and i know him 
i had to wait until today cos he has
a scar on the back of his neck
and when his hair is long
you can t see it 
  he went to have a haircut today   
  and the scar was gone 
no  it s still there 
of course it s still there 
what did you expect  he s still ted 
  excuse me  can i say one thing 
  please  he s still your husband ted 
  i know something   
  katherine

  katherine

  i will give you my name   
  kibner wants people to fit the world 
  i wanna report this 
  i want the world to fit people 
  we ll talk about this later 
  where s homer  or kazantzakis 
  where s jack london 
  where s elizabeth 
  i m afraid 
  i understand  i know

  katherine  just trust me

  ok 
  all right 
  ok 
thank you 
they don t wanna hear
about the accident 
it s a big conspiracy 
  what s a conspiracy 
  everything 
excuse me 
i understand what you re trying to say 
my name is elizabeth driscoll 
the public health department  call me 
katherine  come on  katherine 
that woman s husband
is not her husband 
i saw him with geoffrey  he s one of them 
she knows about it
  and nobody s helping her 
  no  somebody s helping her 
i m glad you heard that  david  elizabeth 
i ve heard it all week  it s popular 
  what is 
  i was trying to tell you
  that i also know somebody   
  who s changed 
  yes 
  can we go outside and talk about it 
listen  there s a lady up top   red hair 
blue dress  she s interested in your work 
i ve heard the same damn story
this week from six patients 
people are changing 
becoming less human 
it s happening all around us 
that s not what we re talking about 
this has nothing to do with
the man i live with 
it has everything to do with it 
don t you see 
people step in and out of relationships
because they don t want responsibility 
that s why marriages are going to hell 
the family unit is shot to hell 
  david  you re not listening to her 
  stay out of this 
you see  that s the point 
i m listening 
but he doesn t think i am  why 
because he doesn t expect me
to bother enough  or to care 
  bellicec  for the last time  stop 
  stop what  
  stand still  be quiet  and shut up 
  jack 
how did you feel about that 
why in the store  he s a nut 
how did you feel 
you were probably shocked 
you wanted to shut your feelings off 
maybe make believe it wasn t happening
cos then you don t have to deal with it 
i wanna deal with that woman
in the bookstore 
why 
do you identify with her 
yes 
ok 
come on 
suppose i were to tell you that katherine
is trying to escape from a relationship 
  he s treating her 
  so why d he push me against a wall 
  she s upset 
  she looks fine 
  she is upset  jack 
  you look upset to me now 
do me a favour  will ya 
go home and i ll call you later 
  go home and leave us alone for a bit 
  go home 
  ok 
  ok  ok 
thank you 
you re jumping to a bizarre conclusion 
that this man you live with
has been replaced by somebody else 
isn t it more likely
you want to believe he s changed
because you re really looking
for an excuse to get out 
i don t know 
will you think about it  please 
before you make a move 
before you jump and
destroy something you have  will you 
please 
yeah 
thank you 
i just gave her
a psychological band aid  matthew 
i should talk to her some more 
you could bring her by my office
tomorrow around four 
what s the matter with her 
it s like there s some kind of
hallucinatory flu going around 
people get over it in a day or two 
all i can do is treat the symptoms 
she s gonna be ok 
a good night s sleep wouldn t hurt 
  is it contagious 
  oh  matthew 
  take her home to her boyfriend 
  that wasn t what i was thinking 
i was just wondering
if the health department should look at it 
who knows  i don t know 
i wish i did 
ok 
take her home  matthew 
ah  jack  how was the book party 
is that kibner s new book

  it s elizabeth s double 
  where 
lots of leaves and a pot 
it was there  david 
i swear to god it was there 
officer  there was a duplicate
of elizabeth driscoll 
  and it s been taken 
  the missing woman 
  she s not missing 
  where is she 
  she s at matthew s 
  don t tell him that 
  then there is no missing body 
  that s right 
  there is and he s taken it 
  no  he took elizabeth 
  you took elizabeth away 
  yes 
  you broke in here 
  i had to because she was not safe here 
so you took her out of here 
no  i took her from there 
her other body was in here   
please stop 
matthew  that s enough  please stop 
  lieutenant  i m dr david kibner 
  ah  the psychiatrist 
my wife reads your books 
  i m glad  it sounds complicated    
  david   
  but my friend has had some difficult
emotional experiences recently 
but i think this is something
we can work out amongst ourselves 
  all right  i ll leave this part of it with you 
  i appreciate it 
you can t accomplish anything here 
we gotta get outside 
i think you might wanna consider filing
an unlawful entry against mr bennell 
i know what you re saying  but outside   
no  i ll take dr kibner s word
that elizabeth is all right 
  fine  then let s go 
  ok 
will elizabeth be coming home 
no 
i have to pick up some of her clothes 
all right 
all right  let s back up
and go through it once more 
step by step 
you all thought you saw a body
at the baths 
you thought it was dead 
you didn t know what it was 
you touched it  all of you touched it 
  nancy  you saw it open its eyes 
  it looked right at me 
  and  bellicec  you saw its eyes open 
  no  i saw its nose bleed 
if you saw its nose bleed 
and nancy saw its eyes open 
he must have been alive 
no  david  you re looking at it
as if it was human  it was not human 
  matthew  what else would it be 
  it was something  but not human 
  it had white hair on it 
  it was growing 
the one at jack s was   
it was like jack  but not as developed
as the one at elizabeth s place 
it had tendrils on it 
the one at her place was duplicating her 
if matthew hadn t taken me away 
the same thing that s happened
to geoffrey would have happened to me 
elizabeth  would you please tell me  in
your opinion  exactly what is happening 
people are being duplicated 
and once it s happened to you 
you re part of this thing 
it almost happened to me 
look 
the reason you don t believe elizabeth
is because the other body disappeared 
it disappeared because geoffrey took it 
well  then what happened
to my other body  then 
oh  people 
will you please listen to yourselves 
will you listen to what you are saying 
i can deal with a body being moved and
even with a body getting up and leaving 
but when you start talking about
his other body  being duplicated   
listen to how that sounds 
we know how insane this sounds 
but what do you think we re doing 
do you think we re making it up 
do you believe that my body looked like
me and that her body looked like her 
d you think we re crazy 
you are trying to make us believe
that we are seeing things  why 
all i m trying to do is help 
you call me in the middle of the night and
ask me to help  that s all i m trying to do 
well  i m sorry if we woke you up 
if we inconvenienced you 
i guess we owe you an apology 
i mean  i mean   
i guess that s a rotten thing to do 
you ve upset my wife  too 
david  i don t know what it is
or where it comes from 
but i saw it and i m gonna fight it 
matthew  my friend     i believe you 
i ve known you too long
not to believe you 
what do you wanna do 
well  if i could get official support 
i d institute the emergency procedures
that we use for cholera
or legionnaires  disease 
  what do you want me to do 
  i can handle the health department 
but if panic breaks out 
we ll need the police and the guard 
and that means the mayor and   
the mayor s a patient of yours  isn t he 
how did you know that 
what do you want me to do 
would you ask him
to accept my telephone call 
i ll call him in a hour  i ll be at my office 
if you have any other ideas  get in touch 
call me 
thank you 
the sooner the better 
this smells lovely 
  i want you to listen to me 
  i am listening to you  nancy 
i am not seeing things 
i know i saw what i saw
and i know it was turning into you  jack 
now  that body we found   
that flower  where did you get that 
  in the vase with the others 
  just stuck in there 
  yeah  why 
  geoffrey gave me one last night 
so what 
a customer  mr gianni 
brought one of those to the baths 
so what 
  put it down  jack 
  it s a pod with a flower on it 
  i could not find that flower in any book 
  jack  put it down 
  it s a pink flower  honey 
  it could be toxic 
i have seen these flowers all over 
they grow like parasites on other plants 
  where are they coming from 
  outer space 
  they re not from outer space 
  why not 
  they re not 
  why  
what are you talking about 
a space flower 
why not a space flower 
why do we always expect metal ships 
i ve never expected metal ships 
there must be other ways
they get in our systems 
right  they could be getting into us
through touch or fragrance 
we would never even notice it 
not from the impurities we have 
i mean  we eat junk and we breathe junk 
i don t know where they re coming from 
but i feel as though i ve been poisoned 
we ve gotta take those flowers in
and have them analysed 
  there s something here 
  they could get into us
and screw up our genes like dna 
recombine us  change us 
oh  of course 
this is the same way
those rockets landed years ago 
so those spacemen could mate with
monkeys and create the human race 
it s happening now
