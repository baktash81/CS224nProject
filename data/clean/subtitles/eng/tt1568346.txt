and the frame 
  dark 
  postmark 
same as last time 
and no note 
no 
i m so sorry  henrik 
will you appeal 
what is this 
the media event of the year 
don t try to play it down  mikael 
it won t work 
don t try to play it up 
that won t work either 
mikael  can we get a quote 
mikael  will you appeal 
yes  i ll appeal to you  viggo 
up until today  mr  blomkvist
was able to play the victim   
   the brave journalist going up
against the bad guy 
i don t know why malicious intent
couldn t be proven 
  when you call a guy a criminal  
  if you want to say these things  
mikael blomkvist likes publicity 
there s really no greater disgrace
for a journalist than libel 
  was found guilty today on 16 counts
of aggravated libel 
can i get that sandwich there 
and a black coffee 
in an article published earlier
this year  blomkvist claimed   
   wennerström  founder and president
of the wennerström group   
   used state funds intended
for industrial development in poland   
   in an arms deal with the right wing
ustaše in croatia 
i have nothing against mr  blomkvist 
he s a fine journalist   
   who i don t believe
is guided by malice 
but what he wrote was inaccurate 
and inaccuracies
can t go unanswered 
all journalists have to accept 
like the rest of us   
   actions have consequences 
blomkvist was ordered to pay   
   600 000 swedish kronor
in damages and all court costs 
can i get a packet of marlboro red
and a lighter 
yeah 
  where have you been 
  walking  thinking 
  smoking 
  yeah  just one 
tv4 called 
i told them no statement   
   until we ve read
the judgment in its entirety 
well  i have  anyone else 
everyone who wants
to see you humiliated 
  been on the phone all morning 
  i m as much to blame 
  you are  you wrote it 
  i read it  i ran it 
  not the same 
  our credibility isn t dead yet 
mine is 
i m tired 
i m gonna go home 
crawl under the duvet for a week 
i ll call greger 
tell him i m not coming home 
thank you 
it s possible we could wait forever 
  you called her and spoke to her 
  i m afraid that doesn t mean much 
no one here particularly likes her 
i find it s much better
if she works from home 
but you told her
i wanted to meet with her 
i ve told her many times
i prefer her not to meet clients 
  you like her 
  very much 
she s one of the best investigators
i have  as you saw from her report 
  but 
  i m concerned you won t like her 
  she s different 
  in what way 
in every way 
miss salander is here 
lisbeth 
mr  dirch frode 
how do you do 
something wrong with the report 
no  it was quite thorough 
but i m also interested
in what s not in it 
  there s nothing not in it 
  your opinion of him isn t 
  i m not paid to give my opinion 
  so you don t have one 
he s clean  in my opinion 
you mean he s hygienic 
he s who he presents himself to be 
in his business  that s an asset 
well  there s less in his asset column
after his conviction today 
true  he made a fool of himself 
if it happened that way 
are you suggesting
that he was set up 
that was never part
of my assignment 
but you re right 
he did make a fool of himself
professionally 
how much of a fool did he make
of himself financially 
the judgment will just about
empty his savings 
  may i go 
  moment 
your report is light in another area 
his personal life 
anything you chose not to disclose 
nothing that warranted inclusion 
does that mean yes or no 
i think what miss salander means  and
i agree  is that everyone has a right   
   to a certain amount of privacy 
even if they re being investigated 
not in this case 
i need to know anything about him   
   i might find unsavory 
even if she doesn t 
he s had a longstanding
sexual relationship   
   with his co editor of the magazine 
it wrecked his marriage but not hers 
sometimes he performs cunnilingus 
not often enough  in my opinion 
no  you re right not to include that 
i know 
you needed a better attorney 
you needed your sister 
  she offered 
  he declined 
  as she hoped 
  never a good idea 
  mixing family and business 
  i would ve lost anyway 
it wasn t about mikael  it was about
wennerström sending a message   
   to the press and the fsa 
saying   don t ask questions  
cheer up 
dad 
nilla  you don t have
to worry about me 
  mom s worried 
  about me 
about the money 
good evening 
nilla  what are you doing 
nothing 
are you serious 
i don t wanna talk about it
since i know you won t approve 
of    
  nilla 
  light of life 
light of what 
  hello 
  herr blomkvist 
  yeah 
  forgive me for intruding on christmas 
my name is dirch frode 
i m an attorney  i represent henrik
vanger  perhaps you ve heard of him 
yeah  of course i have 
he d love to talk to you
about a private matter 
this is an awkward moment 
oh  i m sorry  i m about to sit down
to a christmas dinner myself 
no  that s not exactly what i meant 
you re referring
to your recent legal problems 
that has provided us
with much amusement 
i m sorry 
herr vanger has little love
for herr wennerström either 
  have him call me 
  but he would love to speak to you   
   in person  if possible  up north 
  in hedestad 
  that s not gonna be possible 
herr blomkvist  he s far too old
to go to stockholm  please 
be so kind as to consider 
hedestad is lovely in the winter 
i ll call you back on this number 
okay 
usually when i wake up in a cold bed
it s at home 
  i m sorry 
  what are you doing 
  i m writing a press release 
  saying 
you re taking over as publisher 
you re very sorry   
   for any nuisance
mr  wennerström was caused   
     and i can t be reached for comment 
  are you giving up 
stepping aside 
this makes me sick 
  first time in hedestad 
  and the last 
oh  don t say that 
it s lovely in the spring 
you said it would be lovely
in the winter 
well  this is unseasonable 
well  i ll be on the 4 30 train
back to stockholm 
unless we get snowed in 
i m joking 
you ll be home tonight 
if that s what you wish 
welcome 
come inside 
it s warm 
how do you do 
so   
   what do you know about me 
you used to run one of the largest
industrial firms in the country 
   used to   that s correct 
  oh  i didn t mean that 
  should i stay 
  no 
my grandfather forged the tracks   
   that the 4 30 train
will take you home on 
we stitched this country together 
we made the steel  milled the lumber
that built modern sweden 
and what do you think
our most profitable product now is 
fertilizer 
i m not obsessed by
the declining health of the company 
but i am with
the settling of accounts 
and the clock is ticking 
i need your help 
i m   doing what 
officially  assisting
with my memoirs 
but what you ll really be doing   
   is solving a mystery
by doing what you do so well 
your recent legal mishap
notwithstanding 
you will be investigating thieves 
misers  bullies   
   the most detestable collection
of people that you will ever meet 
my family 
would you like to sit  i could possibly
clear a place if necessary 
  did you make it 
  have you something for me 
i am on welfare  i do not administer it 
this is not enough 
no  thank you 
this is harriet 
the granddaughter
of my brother richard 
richard was a nazi
of the first order   
   joining the nationalist socialist
freedom league when he was 17 
isn t it interesting how fascists
always steal the word  freedom  
oh  the 4 30  yes  i know  okay 
anyway  richard died a martyr
to the nazi cause in 1940 
missed all the real excitement 
but not the opportunity to regularly
beat his wife  margareta   
   and their son  gottfried 
now  gottfried  harriet s father   
   was what they used to call
a good time charlie 
  they still call them that 
  do they  okay 
he was a charmer 
a ladies  man and a drunk 
in other words  a born salesman 
which he did for the company   
   traveling around
and taking clients out to dinner 
  well  somebody s gotta do it 
  that s right 
anyway  he died in 1965 
drowned  drunk  here on the island 
his wife  isabella  who had been pretty
much useless as a parent before   
   became even more so
after his death   
   which is when i began
looking after the children 
martin  who runs vanger industries 
now that i m retired 
that s right  i googled him 
and harriet 
she was bright  curious   
   a winning combination
in any person 
  and beautiful 
  yeah 
something happened to her 
someone in the family
murdered harriet   
   and for the past 40 years   
   has been trying
to drive me insane 
it was september 24th  1966 
a saturday 
harriet was 16 
my brothers   
   and their wives and their children
and grandchildren   
   were all gathered here   
   for our loathsome annual
board meeting and dinner 
it was also the day the yacht club
held their autumn parade 
harriet  with one or two school
friends  went into town to see it 
she returned a little after 2 00 
she came into the parlor 
she asked if she could talk to me 
i honestly don t remember
what i was doing   
   that i thought
was more important   
   but i told her
to give me a few minutes 
it was during those few minutes
that something else occurred 
the accident had nothing to do
with harriet   
   and yet everything 
it was chaos as everybody
put down what they were doing 
police  ambulance  fire brigade   
   reporters  photographers  onlookers
all quickly arrived from town   
   just as we on the island  the family 
hurried to the bridge from our side 
the driver of the car   
   a man named aronsson   
   was pinned and severely injured 
we tried desperately
to pry him loose with our hands   
   since metal tools might spark 
it was an hour after the crash
that harriet was in the kitchen 
anna herself saw her 
well  we finally got poor aronsson
out of his car and off to the hospital 
just as we from our side   
   slowly drifted back to the house 
the sun was down 
the excitement over 
we sat down to dinner 
it was then that i noticed   
   harriet wasn t there 
and she wasn t there
the next morning 
or the next 
or the next 40 years 
what was she going to tell me 
why didn t i make time for her 
why didn t i listen 
  and she couldn t have just run away 
  no  not without being seen 
the firemen stayed out all night   
   on the bridge
pumping up gasoline 
no one swam across
or took a boat 
all the boats were still tied up
on this side sunday 
believe me  i checked 
she couldn t have just fallen
and drowned 
no  the currents aren t strong here 
anything that falls in the water turns up 
like her father 
his body didn t drift
more than 10 meters   
   when he drowned the year before 
oh  no  someone killed her 
someone on the island that day 
someone close enough to know   
   what she used to give me
each year on my birthday 
those are from her 
and the rest  from her killer 
who knows about these 
there s me  the police  the killer   
   and now you 
after the police investigation
evaporated   
   i kept at it  studying
all the information there was 
i have spent half my life
examining the events of a single day 
i understand your frustration   
   but what you re asking me to do 
it s a waste of money 
  but we haven t discussed your fee 
  we don t need to 
thank you 
i can t find something
you ve been unable to find in 40 years 
you don t know that  you have
a very keen investigative mind 
here s what i propose 
you come stay on the island 
i have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use 
you study the material i send you 
you find something i ve missed
or you don t 
what you re asking me to do
is set aside my life and career for  
think of this
as a well deserved holiday 
a way of avoiding all those people
that you might want to avoid right now 
as for compensation 
i ll pay you double your salary   
   for as many months as it takes 
  quadruple it if you solve the mystery 
  herr vanger  
i m not done 
i will throw in one more thing   
   even though
you re a terrible negotiator 
it s something you want
more than anything else   
   and it can t be bought at any price 
so let me give it to you 
hans erik wennerström 
he began his career
working for me   
   and i have followed it with interest 
shall we say  ever since 
you were right about him 
you just couldn t prove it 
we re in the middle of the worst crisis
ever  and you re writing a memoir 
  you fired me  i need something to do 
  you fired you 
i need you here  not the north pole 
mikael  you know
what this is going to look like 
like i ve been gutted 
i m running away  i am 
wennerström wants to see me
wave a white flag  not a red flag 
if it looks like there s a problem
between us  it ll satisfy him 
there is a problem between us 
he won t be satisfied
until he shuts us down 
  you re leaving me to fight him alone 
  it s four hours by train 
it s not the north pole 
hey  hey 
network busy 
please try again later 
what 
some milk 
network busy 
please try again later 
oh  yeah  these as well 
  you re mr  palmgren s daughter 
  his ward  he doesn t have a daughter 
please 
he s had severe
cerebral hemorrhaging   
   either from the fall itself
or from a stroke that led to the fall 
his blood pressure is still high 
i m hopeful he ll regain consciousness 
but that s not assured 
and it s possible  even if he does   
   that there will be
neurological damage 
oh  jeez 
hi  i m gunnar 
the caretaker 
  oh  hey  gunnar  come in 
  okay 
  you want to put it in there 
  okay 
you re an author 
well  i m doing a biography
of herr vanger 
  i saw you on television 
  that s unfortunate 
bit of trouble  i guess 
  no jail time though  that s good 
  no 
cost you a lot of money
though  yeah 
there 
the entire island
is owned by my family 
your closest neighbor
is my brother harald   
   another nazi  if you can believe 
two in the family 
oh  yes  he s quite detestable 
to put it nicely 
but you ll probably never see him 
he s a recluse 
  he was there that day 
  indeed  he was 
his daughter  cecilia 
lives over there 
they don t speak 
does anybody speak
to anybody on this island 
actually  isabella  harriet s mother 
who lives there   
   she speaks to harald  which is one
of the reasons i don t speak to her 
right 
cecilia s brother  birger 
lives over there 
who doesn t he speak to 
you  probably 
but you wouldn t want him to  he can
be just as unpleasant as harald 
quickly losing track
of who s who here 
how you ll wish it were always so 
soon you will know us all
only too well  with my apologies 
now  out there  my grandnephew
martin s house  harriet s brother 
  who speaks to him 
  i speak to him 
he runs the company now 
as i think i told you 
someone s shooting his dinner 
gunnar  probably 
oh  yes  i met him earlier 
he was 19 when
harriet disappeared 
well  he lives over there 
  and you live there 
  sorry 
your house 
oh  yes 
yes  you re right 
the man who hires the detective   
   should always be kept
on the suspects list 
her mother 
but what about the search  please 
please  i beg you 
the fact that i never found a body
was not surprising 
you can t dig up an entire island 
but neither could i find the motive 
was it spontaneous 
was it calculated 
did she know something
someone wished she didn t 
  was it about business 
  business  well  she was 16 
and very bright 
henrik told me and many others
he could easily see her   
   running the company one day 
she was with some friends
that day at a parade 
she told them she was feeling unwell 
she left early 
but they also told me
she kept secrets from them too 
the main thing i learned was that
teenage girls are complicated 
  i have one 
  then you know 
i wanted to   
   ask you about this 
she received that from henrik
the christmas before 
i ve studied it more times
than i can say 
i know every page of it 
  it s the last page i was curious about 
  as was i 
it s a list of names  numbers
and it must have some significance 
all local phone numbers 
the first belonged
to a woman  margot   
   whose mother was magda 
who denied knowing harriet 
the fourth  r l  
belonged to rosmarie larsson   
   an elderly woman who died
some years before 
the other three were not connected
in any way that i could find 
i reminded you of things
you d rather forget  and i m sorry 
i can t forget 
it s my rebecka case 
i don t know what that is 
every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over 
back then we had an
officer torstensson 
year after year  he kept
going back to this rebecka case 
taking out the files 
studying them over and over 
we were young 
we laughed at him 
and that was also
a missing girl case 
no  no  no 
that s not why i mention it 
i m talking about
the soul of a policeman 
poor old torstensson
never solved it 
and he never let it go 
so how s mr  palmgren doing 
i heard he had a stroke
of some kind 
it s terrible 
now  what exactly do you do
at this security company 
make coffee  sort mail 
but not full time 
not even part time consistently 
they somehow got along without
coffee or mail in july and august 
  how much do you make there 
  enough 
how much is your rent 
i pay my rent 
and when was the last time
you were late 
never 
you think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive 
here s the problem 
there s a discrepancy
between the obligation   
   of mr  palmgren s guardianship
and the management of your finances 
there s no discrepancy  it was clear
i could manage my own finances 
that is not clear to me 
  i m not a child 
  you are not  but you were 
and between then and now 
you were committed   
   to the locked ward of st  stefan s
where you continued   
   to display violent aggression 
and you failed to adapt
to four foster homes   
   were arrested twice for intoxication 
twice for narcotics   
   again for assault 
smashing a bottle into a man s face 
and it s not even that long ago 
you may have conned mr  palmgren
into thinking that you have changed   
   but when i m looking at this   
   not to mention the way
you re looking at me now   
   i don t think you have 
so the good old
mr  palmgren days are over 
starting now  you will be given
a monthly allowance 
you ll provide me with receipts
for your expenses 
if the numbers don t balance  i assume
the difference is going to drugs 
i ve taken care of myself
since i was 10 
the state has taken care of you 
miss salander  please  look at me 
this is important 
since your behavior
is elaborately documented in here   
   it will shock no one
if i chose an alternative   
   to the very lenient arrangement
i have just outlined 
would you prefer
institutionalization 
  mikael 
  yes 
  i m liv 
  oh  hi 
we re going to the same place 
hop in 
oh  good  thank you 
i found him at death s door 
halfway up the hill 
  i m afraid i m a little out of shape 
  it s a climb for anyone 
  i should ve warned you  come in 
  thank you  martin 
henrik says great things about you 
  no  no  leave your shoes on 
  martin  smells wonderful 
  what are we drinking 
  what a place  look at that view 
i used to work in the company s
petrochemical division in göteborg 
when it was sold  i went with it 
a dark day 
i live in hong kong  but come back
to stockholm for family events 
and i drive up to spend
a couple of days with martin 
  it s just the moose steak she wants 
  who can blame her  it s wonderful 
something s left open 
do you like this wine   
     or you want to try something else 
  no  no  it s fine 
you re writing a book now 
martin said 
  henrik s biography 
  i love henrik  he s fascinating 
martin too 
together they are the old sweden
and the new 
yes  they are 
you know about harriet  right 
  you don t 
  yes  i do 
the family doesn t want to talk about it 
but it can t be swept under the rug 
  what can t 
  harriet 
we can talk about it later 
we can talk about it now 
liv knows everything
about my crazy family 
  that s why she ll never marry me 
  that s one reason 
i don t want to read
about that in the book 
everything else is fine 
harriet certainly 
you know 
everything changed after that 
not just the family
but the company as well 
  how so 
  we re not ericsson or nordea 
but we re still the largest
family owned company in the country 
at our height we had
40 000 employees 
we have half of that now 
and that downward slide
began after my sister s death 
it broke henrik s
entrepreneurial spirit   
   and his heart 
  you were here that day 
  i came in later   
   after the accident on the bridge 
with the 4 30 train 
  i know it well 
  a terrible day 
and the days after  you know 
searching  not finding  even worse 
this event  mikael  it has to have
a big part in your book 
i got a call from social welfare 
i ve been assigned a new guardian 
  hi 
  hello 
i thought i d come over
and say hello 
  i m cecilia 
  oh  yes  please  come in 
can i get you some coffee 
no  thank you 
we are all uncomfortable with the idea
of a chronicle of our family 
it s not about the family 
it s about henrik and the company 
like i said 
it s not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone 
unlike the one
that landed you in court 
unlike that one  yes 
so you re not really here to find out
what happened to harriet 
i can t ignore such a dramatic event 
but  no  that s by no means my focus 
those boxes that gunnar
carted down here   
   which are where  in the closet now 
those weren t henrik s investigation 
i wonder sometimes who s crazier 
my nazi father or my obsessed uncle 
since we re talking about her   
   since you brought her up 
what was she like 
what was harriet like 
  i m sure henrik has told you 
  he was my age back then 
he couldn t know what was
really going on with a teenager 
you were the same age 
my sister anita
was closer to her in age 
she knew harriet better than anyone 
you should talk to her 
  i d love to  where is she 
  if i had to guess  london 
you don t know
where your sister lives 
i haven t seen her in years 
we never really got along 
  i m getting used to that comment 
  she hates this place more than i do 
she left 
moved to london  that was it 
you couldn t pay her to send
a christmas card  much less visit 
i ll track her down for you 
if you do  and try talking
to her about us   
   don t be surprised
if she tells you to fuck off 
you re backed up  aren t you 
hard drive at home  yeah 
okay  that s good 
because this one s done 
have you ever had any
sexually transmitted diseases 
and when was the last time
that you were tested for hiv 
how many partners have you had
in the last month 
and how many of those were men 
it s regulation  i have to ask
these things  it s a health matter 
write what you want 
and why do you need
such an expensive computer 
  for work 
  making coffee  sorting mail 
  i should have control of my money 
  and you will 
once you learn to be sociable 
get along with people 
can you do that 
why don t we start
with that now  huh 
why don t we start with me 
you do something for me 
i do something for you 
that s what normal people do 
i want you to have that computer 
feel that 
that s gabardine 
unzip it 
and    
i like the reticence 
it s almost convincing 
anita vanger 
  through there 
  thank you 
excuse me 
i probably should have made
an appointment 
no  it s fine 
  please have a seat 
  thank you 
  mikael 
  mikael  how do you do 
how do you do 
so you re looking
for investment counseling 
well  i would be if i had any money 
i m sorry  i don t understand 
i m writing a biography of your
uncle henrik  that s why i m here 
i haven t seen him in over 20 years 
actually it s a lot more than that 
haven t seen my sister 
haven t seen anyone in that family 
most of what i m writing about
predates that   
   so your recollections are valid 
i wouldn t know where to start 
if that was a question 
well  then let me narrow it down 
i ve gotten up to the 1960s   
   to the event that  you know 
changed everything in henrik s life 
harriet 
everything that i know about that
i told to whatever his name was 
morell 
my recollections
were a lot better then 
i m not really speaking
about the event itself 
i just want to get a clearer sense
of what harriet was like 
she was very messed up 
well  just like all us vanger kids 
really  but    
crazy mother 
drunken father 
at least her father wasn t a nazi 
  was he abusive 
  mine 
no  hers 
not that i ever saw  but you could tell
that something was going on 
some days
she d be very withdrawn 
and then the next minute
she d be putting on makeup   
   and wearing the tightest sweater
that she had to school 
and then she d be studying
her bible like a nun 
no vanger was ever religious 
can you imagine 
she was obviously very unhappy 
  what do you think happened to her 
  everyone knows what 
you don t have any thoughts
about who or why 
all that i know
is that i felt really sorry for her 
i got away when i was 18
and i never went back 
and she d have done the same 
but she never made it to 18 
mr  bjurman  please 
it s lisbeth salander 
hold for a moment  please 
lisbeth  i haven t seen you 
are you well 
i m fine  i m sorry i missed our
appointment  i had a lot of work 
something the matter 
no  no  nothing to be
concerned about 
actually  i need another advance
on my allowance 
can i come to your office tonight 
i don t work at night  lisbeth 
why don t you come to my house 
huh  do you have a pen 
i don t need a pen 
what s the address 
it s    
  hello 
  it s me 
lisbeth 
come on in 
  you like it 
  it s nice 
it s home 
what do you need money for
this time 
food 
how are you 
i m so glad you decided
to come and visit 
i just want my money 
well  let s see if we can
help you out with that 
wait 
is there a problem 
i just want to know   
   am i going to have to do this
every time i need money to eat 
you re so cute when you re surly 
i forgot to ask you 
you like anal sex 
faith is the assurance
of things hoped for   
   the evidence of things not seen 
through faith we understand   
   that the world was created
by the word of god 
  i ll drive you home 
  i can get home on my own 
are you sure 
  is it any warmer inside 
  no 
i apologize if you ve been having
financial problems   
   at the magazine
during mikael s absence 
  we ll work through them 
  are you sure 
how long do you think
you can hang on 
six months 
that sounds about right 
i used to be
in the newspaper business 
  we owned six dailies back in the  50s 
  we still own one 
  the courier  here in town 
  which i let my nephew  birger  run   
   because he can t run
anything else 
so  what would you say
to taking on a partner 
well  we ve never had
to consider it before 
we value our independence
very much 
independence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers 
however much you have  you retain 
we don t care about content 
excuse me  did i miss something 
talking about investing
in the magazine 
  i gathered that  but why 
  not out of greed  that s for sure 
i feel badly that i ve taken mikael away
from you at the worst possible time 
but now i am convinced that this is
the right thing to do  the moral thing 
that s one reason  and    
and    
the enemies of my friends
are my enemies 
how long have you been
discussing this with them 
i haven t  they called yesterday
and asked me to come up 
  why didn t you tell me 
  you live in the woods 
  i deserve to be treated like an idiot 
  i wanted to hear what they had to say 
you would ve said no
before they could 
well  i m saying it now 
it s a bad idea 
you heard me tell them
we had six months  i lied 
we will be out of business in three 
but you don t know this family
like i do  they re crazy 
we re not marrying into it 
if we do this 
that s exactly what we re doing 
so you wanna say no  let s say no 
instead of 50 percent of something 
let s own 100 percent of nothing 
  mikael 
  what 
i m leaving this godforsaken island
in the morning 
  so 
  so are you coming to bed or not 
how much do one of those cost 
around 3000 
this is really gonna hurt 
your call 
vanger industries took a controlling
interest in millennium magazine   
   which  according to analysts 
has been in financial trouble    
millennium is an excellent magazine 
we think it s undervalued right now 
which is good business for us 
well  there s another reason 
i don t like bullies 
are you referring
to mr  wennerström 
i m referring to anyone who tries
to sue his enemies into submission 
if herr wennerström
would like to try it again   
   he will find himself fighting a
company that can afford to fight back 
i ve always admired henrik vanger 
he s a titan and a gentleman 
but he s also quite old now   
   which may explain how he could be
taken in by a convicted liar 
three twenty 
shit 
the current archive is on cds 
the older stuff  still negatives 
what general period
are you interested in 
september  1966 
thank you 
is this about harriet vanger 
you re too young
to know about that 
everyone here grows up
knowing about her 
it s how we re taught
about strangers 
  lisbeth 
  i need to pay my rent 
i need some money 
oh  come on in 
i feel a bit badly
how we left it last time 
me too 
good  you re alive 
you recognize this  i had it with me
last time  i set it here  remember 
and this snap  you see it 
it s not a snap 
it s a wide angle fiber optics lens 
i thought it was going to be
another blow job   
   which is disgusting enough 
but i misjudged
just how sick you are 
okay  here s what s going to happen 
pay attention 
look at me 
once you can sit again   
   which could be a while  i admit 
we re going to go to my bank   
   and tell them that i alone
have access to my money 
nod  after that
you will never contact me again 
each month you will prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have 
in it  you ll describe
how well i m doing 
how  sociable  i m becoming 
then you will negotiate with the court   
   to have my declaration
of incompetence lifted 
if you fail  this video will spread
across the internet like a virus 
nod 
and if anything should happen to me 
if i get run over by a car   
   if you run me over with a car 
this will upload automatically 
nod that you understand 
gabardine 
i m taking the keys to this apartment
because i ll be checking on you 
if i find a girl in here with you  whether
she came of her own free will or not    
no  not the video 
i ll kill you 
do you doubt anything i ve said 
do you doubt what s in the reports that
have followed me around all my life 
what do they say 
if you had to sum it up 
they say i m insane 
no  it s okay 
you can nod because it s true 
i am insane 
nod 
i know it s going to be hard for you
to abide by my rules 
the abstinence part most of all 
so i m going to make it
easier for you 
lie still 
i ve never done this before 
and there will be blood 
  hi 
  hi 
what are you doing here 
on my way to skellefteå 
i can only stay a couple of hours 
what s in skellefteå 
bible camp 
oh  yeah 
i m not dangerous 
it s fine  nilla 
whatever you want to do is fine 
everybody needs something 
just as long as it s not god 
i didn t say that 
i haven t been around enough to
really know what s going on with you 
and i apologize for that  but i d never
want you not to tell me something   
   because you think
i might not want to hear it 
that s what i m doing 
it should ve been me visiting you 
  i m sorry 
  it s okay 
it was nice seeing you 
bye bye 
  i ll see you 
  yeah 
thanks 
oh  don t go too hard
on the catholics 
  the what 
  the article you re writing 
oh  i m not writing
an article about catholics 
the bible quotes by your desk 
i love you 
a woman who is a medium
or a sorcerer   
   shall be put to death by stoning 
if a dove is the sinner s offering   
   the priest shall wring off its head 
cleave its wings   
   and burn it upon the altar 
  hello 
  detective morell  it s mikael blomkvist 
yes  hello  how are you 
not still freezing in hedestad 
i hope  for your sake 
you know that rebecka case
you mentioned 
would you recall her last name 
of course i do 
but what has that to do with anything 
  nothing  probably 
  jacobsson  rebecka jacobsson 
and how was she killed 
she was decapitated 
her arms were cut off
and she was burned 
but all that happened in the 1940s 
  what have you found 
  i have to call you back 
why   
  is it henrik 
  we were talking 
he rubbed his arm 
then he collapsed 
  think he s gonna be okay 
  i honestly don t know 
  you go  talk to you later 
  i m sorry 
evening 
so how is he 
well  the good news is he survived 
how he does now  we ll have to see 
  he s in intensive care 
  right 
  may i have one of those 
  you want a sandwich 
  small scotch 
  sure 
thank you 
i hate to be indelicate 
but henrik promised me something   
     when i agreed to do this 
  wennerström 
i need to know what he has on him 
now  in case    
in case he dies 
  well  that is indelicate 
  and i apologize 
i don t know what he has on him 
if you re asking me 
and he can t tell you
in the condition he s in  so    
we also didn t discuss who i d report
to if something should happen to him 
oh  well  you d report to me 
of course 
but we both know that nothing s
going to come of this  don t we 
  no  no  we don t know that 
  what do you mean 
  i may have found something 
  you re joking 
what have you found 
the last time i reported on something
without being absolutely sure   
   i lost my life savings 
i need a research assistant 
can you authorize that 
yes  do you have one in mind 
  i can find someone 
  i know an excellent one 
she did the background check
on you 
the what 
well  you don t think we can
hire just anyone   
   without doing
a background check 
i want to read that 
herr frode was kind enough
to share your report with me 
the investigator s name 
that is her name  yes 
see  i can t find any record of her 
and i m pretty good at that 
  would it matter what her name is 
  if i wanted to speak to her  yes 
  it s against policy 
  you sure 
just like your sources 
you understand 
okay 
here s a name for you 
my sister 
she s also my lawyer 
she ll be contacting you 
there are things in here that can
only have come from one place 
the reason you can find no record of
her is because her records are sealed 
  she s a ward of the state 
  what s that gotta do with anything 
she s had a rough life 
can we please
not make it any rougher 
who is it 
it s mikael blomkvist 
  actually  i m not really up yet 
  may i come in 
please 
hi  you and i need to talk 
i ve got us some breakf  
i m sorry  i didn t realize
you had some company 
who do you think you are 
i m the guy you know better
than my closest friends do 
why don t you put some clothes on 
get rid of your girlfriend 
we need to talk 
i m sorry  you have to go 
okay 
do you need me to stay 
no 
  bye 
  bye 
bye 
  sorry 
  it s okay 
i guess i must have alarmed you 
turning up like that 
if you touch me 
i ll more than alarm you 
that won t be necessary 
your report  very detailed 
  but for me  it wasn t very entertaining 
  it wasn t meant to be 
when i write about people 
i try to entertain the reader 
wennerström wasn t
entertained much 
your boss  armansky   
   yeah  he tells me you only do jobs
that interest you   
   so i suppose i should be flattered 
you gonna sit down 
he also says that you re the one
he goes to when the job is sensitive 
that s the word he used   sensitive  
i m gonna use  illegal    
   because that s what it was
when you hacked into my computer 
no  i m not gonna do anything
about that  i could  but i won t 
what i m gonna do
is i m gonna tell you a story   
   and if it entertains you  maybe you ll
decide to help me research further 
and if not  i ll do the washing up
and you ll never see me again 
here  you should eat that 
what kind of research 
lisbeth   oh  can i call you lisbeth 
i want you to help me catch
a killer of women 
i ve got r j 
rebecka jacobsson 
i ve got absolutely no idea   
   who the rest of these are
or how they re connected   
   to the death of a 16 year old girl 
but they must be somehow 
what we ve gotta do is find out who
they are  what happened to them   
   and what these leviticus verses
have to do with anything 
  what are you doing 
  getting started 
  you can keep talking if you want 
  don t you need to look over these 
i got it 
cat 
how d you get in 
no one has asked me about
magda in over 40 years 
why would a lady like you want
to know about an awful murder 
  it interests me 
  does it 
her husband was the first suspect 
the husband is always
the first suspect and usually the last 
but not this time 
we moved on to a neighbor 
then a vagrant 
once you get to strangers 
it s only a matter of time   
   before you get to gypsies and you
know you re never going to solve it 
how exactly was she killed 
  miss    
  salander 
miss salander  i hope you don t mind
me asking  but when did you last eat 
i have a high metabolism 
i can t put on weight 
i m asking because it is better to look
at what i am about to show you   
   on an empty stomach 
if a man s offering is a lamb 
it shall be a female without blemish 
he should lay his hand
upon its head   
   slaughter it  empty its blood
on the base of the altar   
   and he shall be forgiven 
  how is he 
  he needs surgery   
   but there s no dnr in place 
so it s up to the family to decide   
   should the occasion arise 
whether to resuscitate or not 
and they re not good at decisions 
so how was it with miss salander 
she said yes  do you think
i might be able to see him 
he was asleep the last time i looked 
but let me check 
  thank you 
  don t check 
tell him to pack his things
and leave 
  mother  please 
  don t use that tone with me 
isabella  mr  blomkvist
works for henrik 
  we should put this to a vote 
  don t be an idiot  birger 
we all know what henrik wants 
can we just do that 
henrik is fighting for his life in there 
this is the last thing he needs 
excuse me  mrs  vanger 
there is no smoking in here 
go back to stockholm 
when we need a family chronicle
written by a libelist   
   we know who to call 
all right  thanks 
this way  miss 
if a woman approaches any beast   
   and lies with it  you shall kill
the woman and the beast 
their blood shall be upon them 
my family s impossible 
that s why the company s
such a mess 
i apologize for my
mother s behavior 
i m used to it 
it has nothing to do with you 
it s between her and henrik 
she lost it when my father died 
and her drinking and her    
got so bad henrik took me
and my sister away from her   
   and left her excommunicated
in the old house   
   on the other side of the island 
she hasn t forgiven him 
you must stay 
you re the last chance henrik has
at some kind of resolution 
put this to rest one way or another 
i ll keep my mother away 
but please  hurry 
of course 
lisbeth 
  i ll get that 
  it s okay 
  martin vanger 
  how do you do 
fine 
  it s a girlfriend  or    
  assistant 
thank you so much

i know 
the five cases from harriet s list 
and five more she missed 
three i m sure of 
rebecka was the first 
just as you thought 
the second  m h   is mari holmberg 
a prostitute in kalmar   
   murdered in 1954 
matching leviticus 20 18 
right   if a man lies with a woman
having her sickness   
   he has made naked her fountain
and she has uncovered   
   the fountain of her blood  
raped and stabbed  but cause of death
was suffocation by sanitary napkin 
  okay 
  r l  rakel lunde  1957

and part time palm reader 
tied with a clothesline  gagged  raped 
head crushed with a rock 
leviticus 20 27 
 a woman who is a medium
or sorceress   
   shall be put to death by stoning  
  i usually like to smoke outside 
  sara witt  1964 
daughter of a pastor 
tied to her bed 
raped  charred in the fire
that burned down her house 
leviticus 21  9 
 the daughter of a priest who profanes
herself by playing the harlot   
   profanes her father
and shall be burned with fire  
magda lovisa sjöberg  1960 
found in a barn 
stabbed and raped with farm tools 
the cow in the next stall
had its throat slit 
its blood was splashed on her
and hers on it 
leviticus 20 16 
 if a woman lies with any beast   
   you shall kill the woman and the
beast  their blood is upon them  
lea persson  1962 
found by her sister in their pet shop 
raped  beaten 
the killer uncaged the animals 
smashed the aquariums 
there was a parakeet inside her 
next  eva gustavsson  1960 
a runaway  raped  strangled 
a burnt pigeon tied around her neck 
lena andersson  1967  a student 
raped  stabbed  decapitated  
  okay

with your husband 
who took these 
a local photographer

like your heart wasn t in it 
let s see a little more enthusiasm
for my recovery in next month s 
don t speak  i don t want to hear
your voice  just nod 
start looking for a shrink
you can bribe   
   to swear under oath he can find
absolutely nothing wrong with me 
and stop visiting
tattoo removal websites 
or i ll do it again   
   right here

this is insane 
i mean  these people  
somebody was shooting at me

i m old and we work together  
you work with what s her name

you need to stop talking

  why 
  will you authorize it 
what  the private corporate records 
well  how far back 
henrik said i could have access
to everything  this is what i need 
  that s not what he meant 
  i ll sign a nondisclosure statement 
just a minute 
i think henrik would say yes 
that s why he has me  to protect
him from himself  it s insane 
what have we got to hide 
after 120 years of business 
probably a lot 
if this is what he needs to finish 
he should have permission 
what am i looking for 
any connections between
vanger industries   
   and the towns
where the women were killed 
and everything about frode 
your father was taking pictures
that day that no one has seen 
  i d like to take a look at them 
  so ask him 
  i was wondering if you could do that 
  i don t speak to him 
could you make an exception
in my case 
are you afraid to be
in the same room with him 
i m not saying you shouldn t be 
so you won t help me

  what happened to you 
  when 
just now 
i fell in the dark 
you don t have a flashlight 
i ll get you one 
i just wasn t being careful  that s all 
how s the investigation going 
  nothing new to report 
  no 
dirch says the girl is really clever 
maybe she ll turn something up 
maybe 
thank you for that 
  so  what did he say 
  what 
you said henrik asked you
to ask me something 
  well  i just did 
  what 
  how s the investigation 
  oh  yeah 
that was his question 
do you hunt 
we should go hunting
together sometime 
sure 
nothing at all new to report 
no  nothing 
  i can see you re anxious 
  no 
no  i mean to get home
after the walk 
yeah  well  i suppose i am 
to have dinner with your girlfriend 
assistant 
we ll have better luck with a gun 
  i m sorry 
  when we go hunting 
a gun  rather than a knife 
i want to show you something 
bring your drink 
leave my knife 
to the right 
hi  leave a message  i ll call  
you know what s harder
than shooting someone 
just missing him 
that was a very good shot
up at the cabin 
it didn t work  i m here 
mikael  it did work  you re here 
inside 
you spilled your drink 
why didn t you just go home 
may i 
how did you do it 
what did you find 
we can talk
or we can just get on with it 
i found a photograph   
   no one has seen 
  of 
  you 
in an uppsala prep school blazer 
what does that prove 
you lied about
where you were that day 
  did i 
  or rather  when 
so what  people lie all the time 
it also says that you and lena
andersson were schoolmates 
lena    
that was a long time ago 
where s this photo now  is it with
all the other crap on your desk 
there s a copy on my laptop 
there s another copy   
     on a secure website 
  secure website 
that s a lie 
how much does the girl know 
i hope it s as much as you do 
that ll make it fun 
where is she 
stockholm  she went this morning 
that s a lie 
she s at our offices
looking at more old crap 
i got a call
from our archives manager 
she was very perturbed
with this girl lisbeth 
i like that name 
lisbeth 
so when lisbeth leaves 
i will get a call from security   
   so i can be at your cottage
to greet her 
i can t thank you enough
for bringing her to me 
hey  hey 
so  what do you wanna know 
you re a journalist 
ask me questions 
what do i do with the girls 
that s a good question 
well  before  i do what we re doing 
sit down  relax  have a drink 
i like that part a lot 
having a chat when both of you know
that one of you is going to die 
and afterwards  i just get rid of them 
far out at sea 
unlike my father 
who left them scattered   
   all over the place  like trophies 
that s not very smart  if you ask me 
well  he was a loud
and garish man 
frankly  he got what he deserved 
you can t be a sloppy technician
like that 
you can t drink to excess
like he did 
this takes discipline 
it s a science of a thousand details 
the planning  the execution 
it s the cleanup 
i guess i don t have to tell you   
   but you re going to create
quite a mess here 
let me ask you something 
why don t people
trust their instincts 
they sense something is wrong   
   someone is walking too close
behind them 
you knew something was wrong 
but you came back into the house 
did i force you 
did i drag you in  no 
all i had to do was offer you a drink 
it s hard to believe that
the fear of offending   
   can be stronger than the fear
of pain  but you know what  it is 
and they always come willingly 
and then they sit there 
they know it s all over 
just like you do 
but somehow 
they still think they have a chance 
 maybe if i say the right thing 
maybe if i m polite 
if i cry  if i beg  
and when i see the hope
draining from their face   
   like it is from yours right now   
   i can feel myself   
   getting hard 
but  you know  we re not that different 
you and i  we both have urges 
satisfying mine   
   requires more towels 
it might amuse you to know   
   that while you were upstairs
having moose with me and liv   
   who  by the way 
finds me very conventional   
   i had irina down here in that cage 
who is irina  you might ask 
just another girl 
just another immigrant whore 
  who misses them 
  your sister wasn t 
what 
your sister harriet
wasn t just another girl 
you found her 
what happened to her 
you killed her 
you useless fucking detective 
this too tight to talk 
good  i m tired of talking to you 
i ve never had a man in here before 
in fact  i ve never touched a man   
   except my father 
that was our duty 
harriet s and mine 
hey 
there s a gun 
there s a gun on the television 
  may i kill him 
  yeah 
how come a 23 year old   
   is a ward of the state 
i m mentally incompetent
and can t manage daily life 
since when have they said that 
since i was 12 
what happened when you were 12 
i m sorry 
that s none of my business 
i tried to kill my father 
burned him alive 
got about 80 percent of him 
i made some coffee 
  who s that 
  it s harriet 
i found it in martin s basement
among his souvenirs 
no  martin didn t deny
killing anyone 
but when i mentioned harriet 
he was confused 
he got angry at me because i couldn t
tell him what had happened to her 
he didn t kill her 
his father didn t do it 
he was dead the year before 
what if she did somehow manage
to get away 
i mean  if   
   she is still alive   
   then there s only one person in this
family who d know where she is 
fuck me  fuck me  fuck me 
your turn 
right 
here 
hi  look  i m sorry to bother you 
what do you want 
  has no one called you 
  about 
your cousin martin 
  what about him 
  he died in a car accident   
   last thursday  there s going
to be a memorial in hedestad 
i m not interested in any memorial 
  well  i understand 
  what do you understand 
well  that you don t care
very much for your family 
  look  i just thought you should know 
  now i know 
how d it go 
okay  i think 
she s on 
and she s shopping 
she s still playing solitaire 
  and she hasn t called anyone 
  no 
we have her cell phone too 
i was so sure
she was gonna lead us to her 
put your hand back in my shirt 
there s only one reason
she hasn t called harriet 
she can t  because harriet is dead 
i was just thinking that  
  just one second 
  okay 
what were you going to say 
i was just thinking 
there could be one other possibility 
well  we could  absolutely 
what is it now 
before he died 
your brother hung me from a hook   
   harriet 
so you sent the flowers 
yes  i did 
we found in the swedish family
registry that anita was married 
  but the family never knew  did they 
  no 
so i m guessing she then came here
on her married name passport   
   and you followed
on her maiden name passport 
no  actually 
it was the other way around 
she thought that it was safer
if i traveled with spencer myself 
well  what did he think about that 
nothing  only that he loved her 
she said   if you love me 
you ll do this and not ask why  
and he never did 
and they both died 20 years ago 
car accident 
you found that out too 
is that you 
i was 14 the first time he raped me 
martin 
no  my father 
martin only started after he had died 
  well  why didn t you tell somebody 
  i did  my mother 
  henrik would ve done something 
  i almost told him 
but i was afraid
because of what i d done 
  i    
  you still don t understand  do you 
a year after the first time   
   and there were many times
during that year   
   my father got drunker
than usual one night   
   and he started bragging
about the women he d killed 
he quoted from the bible
as he tore my clothes off 
he tied a belt around my neck 
he wanted to kill me 
i got out of the house 
i went down to the dock 
he came staggering after me 
i could never fight him off
in a small space   
   but out in the open   
   i was strong enough
to deal with an old drunk 
when it was over   
   i looked up and martin was
standing there  staring at me 
and all i d accomplished was
substitute one for another 
a couple of months later  henrik
sent martin to school in uppsala 
and i thought that maybe  just maybe 
the nightmare was finally over 
and then i saw him
the day of the parade   
   across the street 
and i knew
that it would never be over 
so how did you escape 
anita  she    
she insisted
that i leave everything behind 
if i took anything the police might have
suspected that i was still alive 
as everyone ate dinner  i was no more
than 20 meters away from them 
i spent the night there 
that s when the search started 
in the morning  she came to get me 
i d grown up with that bridge
as my link to home   
   but all i could think is   
   if i could just
get away from them   
   just get past the police   
   then i might be safe 
and i was 
until you showed up 
you re safe now 
how did you get away 
someone saved me too 
  how are you feeling 
  i m fine 
thank you  anna 
i made you a promise   
   whether you found anything or not 
so  what do you have to tell me 
what s this 
hello  henrik 
i barely remember wennerström
working here  much less being fired 
how could you 
it was such a long time ago   
   which is kind of more to the point than
the money he embezzled from you 
you re referring
to the statute of limitations   
   but i had no idea this is what
henrik was holding out 
if i had  i never would ve let him
bring you up here 
he wasn t trying to deceive you 
he knows you can t try somebody
35 years after the event 
  i like henrik  but he knows that 
  a man s reputation means something 
he believes that  he thought
you could destroy wennerström   
     in the court of public opinion 
  the court of public opinion   
     celebrates people s bad behavior 
  he s an elderly man 
he promised me
wennerström s carcass on a plate 
this isn t even the plate 
  i can t do anything with this 
  yes  of course 
what happened with wennerström 
how did he get you 
i was stupid  i heard something 
i got it from an anonymous source   
   who i m now sure
was one of wennerström s lackeys 
it was fake 
which he easily proved in court 
you were emphatic
that the way i looked into your life   
   was illegal and immoral  would you
feel the same about wennerström 
  go on 
  i did some work on my own on him   
   before you hired me 
i haven t looked at it all   
   because you
and harriet fucking vanger   
   have kept me busy 
but i may have something 
you may have something 
maybe 
they launder money
from arms and drug sales   
   and crime syndicates in russia 
and that money accounts for all
but 5 percent of his holdings 
the rest ends up in accounts
in the cayman islands 
  and how do you know this 
  this time you don t want to know 
this time i do want to know 
i have access to his computer 
  and his accountant s and lawyer s 
  and how do you have that 
i could ve gotten it from a source
inside the company 
  you didn t 
  but that s what you ll say 
and what will you say to me 
well  that depends
if you really want to know 
i do 
mikael  how did you get access 
financial journalist
mikael blomkvist   
   who  this time last year
was convicted of libel   
   in a stockholm courtroom   
   doesn t seem to have learned
from his mistakes 
or maybe he has 
in the current issue of millennium
magazine  he now charges   
   the company that sued him 
the wennerström group   
the shit hits the fan 
   of criminal activities
on a global scale 
what happens now 
well  he ll say it s a personal vendetta 
which won t wash 
the police will investigate 
fl will investigate 
it ll go to court 
maybe he ll go to prison 
you think 
probably not 
these guys never do 
what s wrong with you 
  it s embarrassing 
  tell me 
i need to borrow some money 
fifty thousand 
i have a chance to make an investment 
it s a smart  safe investment 
  i really don t think i ve got 50 000 
  yes  you do 
you have 65 000
in your two accounts 
i m sorry that i know that 
you ll get the money back 
i promise 
okay 
you want a coffee 
these allegations  like the last one
from this so called journalist   
   are as ridiculous
as they are untrue 
i ll be seeing mr  blomkvist in court
again  and i m looking forward to it 
what about his documentation 
fabricated  all of it 
the securities fraud office isn t quite
as certain as mr  wennerström of that 
if a fraction of what mr  blomkvist
alleges proves to be true   
   not only will there be
a securities investigation   
   but an organized crime inquiry
as well 
mr  blomkvist names no sources 
and we can t force him to 
but we can look for them 
  beginning where 
  those closest to mr  wennerström 
only someone in the inner circle
of a corporation like this   
   has access to this kind
of information 
mr  wennerström isn t available
for comment   
   but i m happy
to answer questions 
  where is he 
  at home  i imagine 
no  he s not 
has he left the country 
i don t think so 
  okay  thank you 
  thank you 
welcome to the dolder grand  miss 
may i have your passport  please 
with his failure to appear   
   before a security exchange
commission panel   
   a warrant has been issued
for the wennerström group ceo 
i can confirm that he left sweden   
   on a private jet
that landed in paris last week 
whether he s still there 
we don t know 
he can be anywhere by now 
thank you 
i have accounts at bank
of kroenenfeld  cayman islands 
i d like to transfer them
and convert to bonds 
  naturally  you have the clearing codes 
  naturally 
how many accounts
will you transfer 
thirty 
  this will take some time 
  you will receive 4 percent commission 
  i will 
  then it won t be a waste of it 
a swedish tourist vacationing
here in barbados   
   says he knows where fugitive
financier hans erik wennerström is 
here  in this caribbean island s
capital  bridgetown 
police released this photo and
believe it is the disgraced billionaire 
how many of these would you like
to convert for deposit 
all 50  into five accounts 
yes  that looks correct 
the man who is now being called
sweden s charles ponzi   
   may no longer have a country
to call home   
   but does have enough money
to buy one 
according to the international
banking commission   
   wennerström  a week after
the millennium article appeared   
   on newsstands 
began emptying accounts   
   at bank of kroenenfeld
in the cayman islands 
that money 
approximately 2 billion euros   
   was then spread over
a number of accounts   
   with the help of this confederate 
seen here in zurich 
  hey 
  hey 
  the money i borrowed 
  already 
thank you 
no  i quit 
it was a good investment 
it was okay 
what are you doing later 
i m seeing my daughter 
okay 
you look nice 
it s christmas again 
i ll see you soon 
mr  wennerström
won the libel case    
you got that call in the office 
i miss our meetings 
i m sure you don t  why would you 
i was always such
a headache for you 
never showing up with good news 
only problems 
i have good news now 
i made a friend 
i mean  one that you d approve of 
i m happy 
a man who authorities here
in marbella have confirmed   
   is fugitive hans erik wennerström 
shot three times in the head   
   in what police are calling
a classic gangland execution 
the investigation
into wennerström s ties   
   to crime organizations worldwide
will now turn into speculation 
which of them caught up with him
before swedish authorities could 
wennerström spent the last days
of his flamboyant life    
  it s nice
