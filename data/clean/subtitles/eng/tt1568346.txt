and the frame
dark
postmark
same as last time
and no note
no
im so sorry henrik
will you appeal
what is this
the media event of the year
dont try to play it down mikael
it wont work
dont try to play it up
that wont work either
mikael can we get a quote
mikael will you appeal
yes ill appeal to you viggo
up until today mr blomkvist
was able to play the victim
the brave journalist going up
against the bad guy
i dont know why malicious intent
couldnt be proven
when you call a guy a criminal
if you want to say these things
mikael blomkvist likes publicity
theres really no greater disgrace
for a journalist than libel
was found guilty today on 16 counts
of aggravated libel
can i get that sandwich there
and a black coffee
in an article published earlier
this year blomkvist claimed
wennerström founder and president
of the wennerström group
used state funds intended
for industrial development in poland
in an arms deal with the rightwing
ustaše in croatia
i have nothing against mr blomkvist
hes a fine journalist
who i dont believe
is guided by malice
but what he wrote was inaccurate
and inaccuracies
cant go unanswered
all journalists have to accept
like the rest of us
actions have consequences
blomkvist was ordered to pay
600000 swedish kronor
in damages and all court costs
can i get a packet of marlboro red
and a lighter
yeah
where have you been
walking thinking
smoking
yeah just one
tv4 called
i told them no statement
until weve read
the judgment in its entirety
well i have anyone else
everyone who wants
to see you humiliated
been on the phone all morning
im as much to blame
you are you wrote it
i read it i ran it
not the same
our credibility isnt dead yet
mine is
im tired
im gonna go home
crawl under the duvet for a week
ill call greger
tell him im not coming home
thank you
its possible we could wait forever
you called her and spoke to her
im afraid that doesnt mean much
no one here particularly likes her
i find its much better
if she works from home
but you told her
i wanted to meet with her
ive told her many times
i prefer her not to meet clients
you like her
very much
shes one of the best investigators
i have as you saw from her report
but
im concerned you wont like her
shes different
in what way
in every way
miss salander is here
lisbeth
mr dirch frode
how do you do
something wrong with the report
no it was quite thorough
but im also interested
in whats not in it
theres nothing not in it
your opinion of him isnt
im not paid to give my opinion
so you dont have one
hes clean in my opinion
you mean hes hygienic
hes who he presents himself to be
in his business thats an asset
well theres less in his asset column
after his conviction today
true he made a fool of himself
if it happened that way
are you suggesting
that he was set up
that was never part
of my assignment
but youre right
he did make a fool of himself
professionally
how much of a fool did he make
of himself financially
the judgment will just about
empty his savings
may i go
moment
your report is light in another area
his personal life
anything you chose not to disclose
nothing that warranted inclusion
does that mean yes or no
i think what miss salander means and
i agree is that everyone has a right
to a certain amount of privacy
even if theyre being investigated
not in this case
i need to know anything about him
i might find unsavory
even if she doesnt
hes had a longstanding
sexual relationship
with his coeditor of the magazine
it wrecked his marriage but not hers
sometimes he performs cunnilingus
not often enough in my opinion
no youre right not to include that
i know
you needed a better attorney
you needed your sister
she offered
he declined
as she hoped
never a good idea
mixing family and business
i wouldve lost anyway
it wasnt about mikael it was about
wennerström sending a message
to the press and the fsa
saying dont ask questions
cheer up
dad
nilla you dont have
to worry about me
moms worried
about me
about the money
good evening
nilla what are you doing
nothing
are you serious
i dont wanna talk about it
since i know you wont approve
of
nilla
light of life
light of what
hello
herr blomkvist
yeah
forgive me for intruding on christmas
my name is dirch frode
im an attorney i represent henrik
vanger perhaps youve heard of him
yeah of course i have
hed love to talk to you
about a private matter
this is an awkward moment
oh im sorry im about to sit down
to a christmas dinner myself
no thats not exactly what i meant
youre referring
to your recent legal problems
that has provided us
with much amusement
im sorry
herr vanger has little love
for herr wennerström either
have him call me
but he would love to speak to you
in person if possible up north
in hedestad
thats not gonna be possible
herr blomkvist hes far too old
to go to stockholm please
be so kind as to consider
hedestad is lovely in the winter
ill call you back on this number
okay
usually when i wake up in a cold bed
its at home
im sorry
what are you doing
im writing a press release
saying
youre taking over as publisher
youre very sorry
for any nuisance
mr wennerström was caused
and i cant be reached for comment
are you giving up
stepping aside
this makes me sick
first time in hedestad
and the last
oh dont say that
its lovely in the spring
you said it would be lovely
in the winter
well this is unseasonable
well ill be on the 430 train
back to stockholm
unless we get snowed in
im joking
youll be home tonight
if thats what you wish
welcome
come inside
its warm
how do you do
so
what do you know about me
you used to run one of the largest
industrial firms in the country
used to thats correct
oh i didnt mean that
should i stay
no
my grandfather forged the tracks
that the 430 train
will take you home on
we stitched this country together
we made the steel milled the lumber
that built modern sweden
and what do you think
our most profitable product now is
fertilizer
im not obsessed by
the declining health of the company
but i am with
the settling of accounts
and the clock is ticking
i need your help
im doing what
officially assisting
with my memoirs
but what youll really be doing
is solving a mystery
by doing what you do so well
your recent legal mishap
notwithstanding
you will be investigating thieves
misers bullies
the most detestable collection
of people that you will ever meet
my family
would you like to sit i could possibly
clear a place if necessary
did you make it
have you something for me
i am on welfare i do not administer it
this is not enough
no thank you
this is harriet
the granddaughter
of my brother richard
richard was a nazi
of the first order
joining the nationalist socialist
freedom league when he was 17
isnt it interesting how fascists
always steal the word freedom
oh the 430 yes i know okay
anyway richard died a martyr
to the nazi cause in 1940
missed all the real excitement
but not the opportunity to regularly
beat his wife margareta
and their son gottfried
now gottfried harriets father
was what they used to call
a goodtime charlie
they still call them that
do they okay
he was a charmer
a ladies man and a drunk
in other words a born salesman
which he did for the company
traveling around
and taking clients out to dinner
well somebodys gotta do it
thats right
anyway he died in 1965
drowned drunk here on the island
his wife isabella who had been pretty
much useless as a parent before
became even more so
after his death
which is when i began
looking after the children
martin who runs vanger industries
now that im retired
thats right i googled him
and harriet
she was bright curious
a winning combination
in any person
and beautiful
yeah
something happened to her
someone in the family
murdered harriet
and for the past 40 years
has been trying
to drive me insane
it was september 24th 1966
a saturday
harriet was 16
my brothers
and their wives and their children
and grandchildren
were all gathered here
for our loathsome annual
board meeting and dinner
it was also the day the yacht club
held their autumn parade
harriet with one or two school
friends went into town to see it
she returned a little after 200
she came into the parlor
she asked if she could talk to me
i honestly dont remember
what i was doing
that i thought
was more important
but i told her
to give me a few minutes
it was during those few minutes
that something else occurred
the accident had nothing to do
with harriet
and yet everything
it was chaos as everybody
put down what they were doing
police ambulance fire brigade
reporters photographers onlookers
all quickly arrived from town
just as we on the island the family
hurried to the bridge from our side
the driver of the car
a man named aronsson
was pinned and severely injured
we tried desperately
to pry him loose with our hands
since metal tools might spark
it was an hour after the crash
that harriet was in the kitchen
anna herself saw her
well we finally got poor aronsson
out of his car and off to the hospital
just as we from our side
slowly drifted back to the house
the sun was down
the excitement over
we sat down to dinner
it was then that i noticed
harriet wasnt there
and she wasnt there
the next morning
or the next
or the next 40 years
what was she going to tell me
why didnt i make time for her
why didnt i listen
and she couldnt have just run away
no not without being seen
the firemen stayed out all night
on the bridge
pumping up gasoline
no one swam across
or took a boat
all the boats were still tied up
on this side sunday
believe me i checked
she couldnt have just fallen
and drowned
no the currents arent strong here
anything that falls in the water turns up
like her father
his body didnt drift
more than 10 meters
when he drowned the year before
oh no someone killed her
someone on the island that day
someone close enough to know
what she used to give me
each year on my birthday
those are from her
and the rest from her killer
who knows about these
theres me the police the killer
and now you
after the police investigation
evaporated
i kept at it studying
all the information there was
i have spent half my life
examining the events of a single day
i understand your frustration
but what youre asking me to do
its a waste of money
but we havent discussed your fee
we dont need to
thank you
i cant find something
youve been unable to find in 40 years
you dont know that you have
a very keen investigative mind
heres what i propose
you come stay on the island
i have a nice little cottage
by the water you can use
you study the material i send you
you find something ive missed
or you dont
what youre asking me to do
is set aside my life and career for
think of this
as a welldeserved holiday
a way of avoiding all those people
that you might want to avoid right now
as for compensation
ill pay you double your salary
for as many months as it takes
quadruple it if you solve the mystery
herr vanger
im not done
i will throw in one more thing
even though
youre a terrible negotiator
its something you want
more than anything else
and it cant be bought at any price
so let me give it to you
hanserik wennerström
he began his career
working for me
and i have followed it with interest
shall we say ever since
you were right about him
you just couldnt prove it
were in the middle of the worst crisis
ever and youre writing a memoir
you fired me i need something to do
you fired you
i need you here not the north pole
mikael you know
what this is going to look like
like ive been gutted
im running away i am
wennerström wants to see me
wave a white flag not a red flag
if it looks like theres a problem
between us itll satisfy him
there is a problem between us
he wont be satisfied
until he shuts us down
youre leaving me to fight him alone
its four hours by train
its not the north pole
hey hey
network busy
please try again later
what
some milk
network busy
please try again later
oh yeah these as well
youre mr palmgrens daughter
his ward he doesnt have a daughter
please
hes had severe
cerebral hemorrhaging
either from the fall itself
or from a stroke that led to the fall
his blood pressure is still high
im hopeful hell regain consciousness
but thats not assured
and its possible even if he does
that there will be
neurological damage
oh jeez
hi im gunnar
the caretaker
oh hey gunnar come in
okay
you want to put it in there
okay
youre an author
well im doing a biography
of herr vanger
i saw you on television
thats unfortunate
bit of trouble i guess
no jail time though thats good
no
cost you a lot of money
though yeah
there
the entire island
is owned by my family
your closest neighbor
is my brother harald
another nazi if you can believe
two in the family
oh yes hes quite detestable
to put it nicely
but youll probably never see him
hes a recluse
he was there that day
indeed he was
his daughter cecilia
lives over there
they dont speak
does anybody speak
to anybody on this island
actually isabella harriets mother
who lives there
she speaks to harald which is one
of the reasons i dont speak to her
right
cecilias brother birger
lives over there
who doesnt he speak to
you probably
but you wouldnt want him to he can
be just as unpleasant as harald
quickly losing track
of whos who here
how youll wish it were always so
soon you will know us all
only too well with my apologies
now out there my grandnephew
martins house harriets brother
who speaks to him
i speak to him
he runs the company now
as i think i told you
someones shooting his dinner
gunnar probably
oh yes i met him earlier
he was 19 when
harriet disappeared
well he lives over there
and you live there
sorry
your house
oh yes
yes youre right
the man who hires the detective
should always be kept
on the suspects list
her mother
but what about the search please
please i beg you
the fact that i never found a body
was not surprising
you cant dig up an entire island
but neither could i find the motive
was it spontaneous
was it calculated
did she know something
someone wished she didnt
was it about business
business well she was 16
and very bright
henrik told me and many others
he could easily see her
running the company one day
she was with some friends
that day at a parade
she told them she was feeling unwell
she left early
but they also told me
she kept secrets from them too
the main thing i learned was that
teenage girls are complicated
i have one
then you know
i wanted to
ask you about this
she received that from henrik
the christmas before
ive studied it more times
than i can say
i know every page of it
its the last page i was curious about
as was i
its a list of names numbers
and it must have some significance
all local phone numbers
the first belonged
to a woman margot
whose mother was magda
who denied knowing harriet
the fourth rl
belonged to rosmarie larsson
an elderly woman who died
some years before
the other three were not connected
in any way that i could find
i reminded you of things
youd rather forget and im sorry
i cant forget
its my rebecka case
i dont know what that is
every policeman has at least one
unsolved case to obsess over
back then we had an
officer torstensson
year after year he kept
going back to this rebecka case
taking out the files
studying them over and over
we were young
we laughed at him
and that was also
a missinggirl case
no no no
thats not why i mention it
im talking about
the soul of a policeman
poor old torstensson
never solved it
and he never let it go
so hows mr palmgren doing
i heard he had a stroke
of some kind
its terrible
now what exactly do you do
at this security company
make coffee sort mail
but not fulltime
not even parttime consistently
they somehow got along without
coffee or mail in july and august
how much do you make there
enough
how much is your rent
i pay my rent
and when was the last time
you were late
never
you think that thing through your
eyebrow makes you attractive
heres the problem
theres a discrepancy
between the obligation
of mr palmgrens guardianship
and the management of your finances
theres no discrepancy it was clear
i could manage my own finances
that is not clear to me
im not a child
you are not but you were
and between then and now
you were committed
to the locked ward of st stefans
where you continued
to display violent aggression
and you failed to adapt
to four foster homes
were arrested twice for intoxication
twice for narcotics
again for assault
smashing a bottle into a mans face
and its not even that long ago
you may have conned mr palmgren
into thinking that you have changed
but when im looking at this
not to mention the way
youre looking at me now
i dont think you have
so the good old
mr palmgren days are over
starting now you will be given
a monthly allowance
youll provide me with receipts
for your expenses
if the numbers dont balance i assume
the difference is going to drugs
ive taken care of myself
since i was 10
the state has taken care of you
miss salander please look at me
this is important
since your behavior
is elaborately documented in here
it will shock no one
if i chose an alternative
to the very lenient arrangement
i have just outlined
would you prefer
institutionalization
mikael
yes
im liv
oh hi
were going to the same place
hop in
oh good thank you
i found him at deaths door
halfway up the hill
im afraid im a little out of shape
its a climb for anyone
i shouldve warned you come in
thank you martin
henrik says great things about you
no no leave your shoes on
martin smells wonderful
what are we drinking
what a place look at that view
i used to work in the companys
petrochemical division in göteborg
when it was sold i went with it
a dark day
i live in hong kong but come back
to stockholm for family events
and i drive up to spend
a couple of days with martin
its just the moose steak she wants
who can blame her its wonderful
somethings left open
do you like this wine
or you want to try something else
no no its fine
youre writing a book now
martin said
henriks biography
i love henrik hes fascinating
martin too
together they are the old sweden
and the new
yes they are
you know about harriet right
you dont
yes i do
the family doesnt want to talk about it
but it cant be swept under the rug
what cant
harriet
we can talk about it later
we can talk about it now
liv knows everything
about my crazy family
thats why shell never marry me
thats one reason
i dont want to read
about that in the book
everything else is fine
harriet certainly
you know
everything changed after that
not just the family
but the company as well
how so
were not ericsson or nordea
but were still the largest
familyowned company in the country
at our height we had
40000 employees
we have half of that now
and that downward slide
began after my sisters death
it broke henriks
entrepreneurial spirit
and his heart
you were here that day
i came in later
after the accident on the bridge
with the 430 train
i know it well
a terrible day
and the days after you know
searching not finding even worse
this event mikael it has to have
a big part in your book
i got a call from social welfare
ive been assigned a new guardian
hi
hello
i thought id come over
and say hello
im cecilia
oh yes please come in
can i get you some coffee
no thank you
we are all uncomfortable with the idea
of a chronicle of our family
its not about the family
its about henrik and the company
like i said
its not my intention to present
a malicious portrait of anyone
unlike the one
that landed you in court
unlike that one yes
so youre not really here to find out
what happened to harriet
i cant ignore such a dramatic event
but no thats by no means my focus
those boxes that gunnar
carted down here
which are where in the closet now
those werent henriks investigation
i wonder sometimes whos crazier
my nazi father or my obsessed uncle
since were talking about her
since you brought her up
what was she like
what was harriet like
im sure henrik has told you
he was my age back then
he couldnt know what was
really going on with a teenager
you were the same age
my sister anita
was closer to her in age
she knew harriet better than anyone
you should talk to her
id love to where is she
if i had to guess london
you dont know
where your sister lives
i havent seen her in years
we never really got along
im getting used to that comment
she hates this place more than i do
she left
moved to london that was it
you couldnt pay her to send
a christmas card much less visit
ill track her down for you
if you do and try talking
to her about us
dont be surprised
if she tells you to fuck off
youre backed up arent you
hard drive at home yeah
okay thats good
because this ones done
have you ever had any
sexually transmitted diseases
and when was the last time
that you were tested for hiv
how many partners have you had
in the last month
and how many of those were men
its regulation i have to ask
these things its a health matter
write what you want
and why do you need
such an expensive computer
for work
making coffee sorting mail
i should have control of my money
and you will
once you learn to be sociable
get along with people
can you do that
why dont we start
with that now huh
why dont we start with me
you do something for me
i do something for you
thats what normal people do
i want you to have that computer
feel that
thats gabardine
unzip it
and
i like the reticence
its almost convincing
anita vanger
through there
thank you
excuse me
i probably should have made
an appointment
no its fine
please have a seat
thank you
mikael
mikael how do you do
how do you do
so youre looking
for investment counseling
well i would be if i had any money
im sorry i dont understand
im writing a biography of your
uncle henrik thats why im here
i havent seen him in over 20 years
actually its a lot more than that
havent seen my sister
havent seen anyone in that family
most of what im writing about
predates that
so your recollections are valid
i wouldnt know where to start
if that was a question
well then let me narrow it down
ive gotten up to the 1960s
to the event that you know
changed everything in henriks life
harriet
everything that i know about that
i told to whatever his name was
morell
my recollections
were a lot better then
im not really speaking
about the event itself
i just want to get a clearer sense
of what harriet was like
she was very messed up
well just like all us vanger kids
really but
crazy mother
drunken father
at least her father wasnt a nazi
was he abusive
mine
no hers
not that i ever saw but you could tell
that something was going on
some days
shed be very withdrawn
and then the next minute
shed be putting on makeup
and wearing the tightest sweater
that she had to school
and then shed be studying
her bible like a nun
no vanger was ever religious
can you imagine
she was obviously very unhappy
what do you think happened to her
everyone knows what
you dont have any thoughts
about who or why
all that i know
is that i felt really sorry for her
i got away when i was 18
and i never went back
and shed have done the same
but she never made it to 18
mr bjurman please
its lisbeth salander
hold for a moment please
lisbeth i havent seen you
are you well
im fine im sorry i missed our
appointment i had a lot of work
something the matter
no no nothing to be
concerned about
actually i need another advance
on my allowance
can i come to your office tonight
i dont work at night lisbeth
why dont you come to my house
huh do you have a pen
i dont need a pen
whats the address
its
hello
its me
lisbeth
come on in
you like it
its nice
its home
what do you need money for
this time
food
how are you
im so glad you decided
to come and visit
i just want my money
well lets see if we can
help you out with that
wait
is there a problem
i just want to know
am i going to have to do this
every time i need money to eat
youre so cute when youre surly
i forgot to ask you
you like anal sex
faith is the assurance
of things hoped for
the evidence of things not seen
through faith we understand
that the world was created
by the word of god
ill drive you home
i can get home on my own
are you sure
is it any warmer inside
no
i apologize if youve been having
financial problems
at the magazine
during mikaels absence
well work through them
are you sure
how long do you think
you can hang on
six months
that sounds about right
i used to be
in the newspaper business
we owned six dailies back in the 50s
we still own one
the courier here in town
which i let my nephew birger run
because he cant run
anything else
so what would you say
to taking on a partner
well weve never had
to consider it before
we value our independence
very much
independence in publishing
is dependent on advertisers
however much you have you retain
we dont care about content
excuse me did i miss something
talking about investing
in the magazine
i gathered that but why
not out of greed thats for sure
i feel badly that ive taken mikael away
from you at the worst possible time
but now i am convinced that this is
the right thing to do the moral thing
thats one reason and
and
the enemies of my friends
are my enemies
how long have you been
discussing this with them
i havent they called yesterday
and asked me to come up
why didnt you tell me
you live in the woods
i deserve to be treated like an idiot
i wanted to hear what they had to say
you wouldve said no
before they could
well im saying it now
its a bad idea
you heard me tell them
we had six months i lied
we will be out of business in three
but you dont know this family
like i do theyre crazy
were not marrying into it
if we do this
thats exactly what were doing
so you wanna say no lets say no
instead of 50 percent of something
lets own 100 percent of nothing
mikael
what
im leaving this godforsaken island
in the morning
so
so are you coming to bed or not
how much do one of those cost
around 3000
this is really gonna hurt
your call
vanger industries took a controlling
interest in millennium magazine
which according to analysts
has been in financial trouble
millennium is an excellent magazine
we think its undervalued right now
which is good business for us
well theres another reason
i dont like bullies
are you referring
to mr wennerström
im referring to anyone who tries
to sue his enemies into submission
if herr wennerström
would like to try it again
he will find himself fighting a
company that can afford to fight back
ive always admired henrik vanger
hes a titan and a gentleman
but hes also quite old now
which may explain how he could be
taken in by a convicted liar
threetwenty
shit
the current archive is on cds
the older stuff still negatives
what general period
are you interested in
september 1966
thank you
is this about harriet vanger
youre too young
to know about that
everyone here grows up
knowing about her
its how were taught
about strangers
lisbeth
i need to pay my rent
i need some money
oh come on in
i feel a bit badly
how we left it last time
me too
good youre alive
you recognize this i had it with me
last time i set it here remember
and this snap you see it
its not a snap
its a wideangle fiberoptics lens
i thought it was going to be
another blow job
which is disgusting enough
but i misjudged
just how sick you are
okay heres whats going to happen
pay attention
look at me
once you can sit again
which could be a while i admit
were going to go to my bank
and tell them that i alone
have access to my money
nod after that
you will never contact me again
each month you will prepare a report
of a meeting we will never have
in it youll describe
how well im doing
how sociable im becoming
then you will negotiate with the court
to have my declaration
of incompetence lifted
if you fail this video will spread
across the internet like a virus
nod
and if anything should happen to me
if i get run over by a car
if you run me over with a car
this will upload automatically
nod that you understand
gabardine
im taking the keys to this apartment
because ill be checking on you
if i find a girl in here with you whether
she came of her own free will or not
no not the video
ill kill you
do you doubt anything ive said
do you doubt whats in the reports that
have followed me around all my life

detective morell its mikael blomkvist
yes hello how are you
not still freezing in hedestad
i hope for your sake
you know that rebecka case
you mentioned
would you recall her last name
of course i do
but what has that to do with anything
nothing probably
jacobsson rebecka jacobsson
and how was she killed
she was decapitated
her arms were cut off
and she was burned
but all that happened in the 1940s
what have you found
i have to call you back
why
is it henrik
we were talking
he rubbed his arm
then he collapsed
think hes gonna be okay
i honestly dont know
you go talk to you later
im sorry
evening
so how is he
well the good news is he survived
how he does now well have to see
hes in intensive care
right
may i have one of those
you want a sandwich
small scotch
sure
thank you
i hate to be indelicate
but henrik promised me something
when i agreed to do this
wennerström
i need to know what he has on him
now in case
in case he dies
well that is indelicate
and i apologize
i dont know what he has on him
if youre asking me
and he cant tell you
in the condition hes in so
we also didnt discuss who id report
to if something should happen to him
oh well youd report to me
of course
but we both know that nothings
going to come of this dont we
no no we dont know that
what do you mean
i may have found something
youre joking
what have you found
the last time i reported on something
without being absolutely sure
i lost my life savings
i need a research assistant
can you authorize that
yes do you have one in mind
i can find someone
i know an excellent one
she did the background check
on you
the what
well you dont think we can
hire just anyone
without doing
a background check
i want to read that
herr frode was kind enough
to share your report with me
the investigators name
that is her name yes
see i cant find any record of her
and im pretty good at that
would it matter what her name is
if i wanted to speak to her yes
its against policy
you sure
just like your sources
you understand
okay
heres a name for you
my sister
shes also my lawyer
shell be contacting you
there are things in here that can
only have come from one place
the reason you can find no record of
her is because her records are sealed
shes a ward of the state
whats that gotta do with anything
shes had a rough life
can we please
not make it any rougher
who is it
its mikael blomkvist
actually im not really up yet
may i come in
please
hi you and i need to talk
ive got us some breakf
im sorry i didnt realize
you had some company
who do you think you are
im the guy you know better
than my closest friends do
why dont you put some clothes on
get rid of your girlfriend
we need to talk
im sorry you have to go
okay
do you need me to stay
no
bye
bye
bye
sorry
its okay
i guess i must have alarmed you
turning up like that
if you touch me
ill more than alarm you
that wont be necessary
your report very detailed
but for me it wasnt very entertaining
it wasnt meant to be
when i write about people
i try to entertain the reader
wennerström wasnt
entertained much
your boss armansky
yeah he tells me you only do jobs
that interest you
so i suppose i should be flattered
you gonna sit down
he also says that youre the one
he goes to when the job is sensitive
thats the word he used sensitive
im gonna use illegal
because thats what it was
when you hacked into my computer
no im not gonna do anything
about that i could but i wont
what im gonna do
is im gonna tell you a story
and if it entertains you maybe youll
decide to help me research further
and if not ill do the washing up
and youll never see me again
here you should eat that
what kind of research
lisbeth oh can i call you lisbeth
i want you to help me catch
a killer of women
ive got rj
rebecka jacobsson
ive got absolutely no idea
who the rest of these are
or how theyre connected
to the death of a 16yearold girl
but they must be somehow
what weve gotta do is find out who
they are what happened to them
and what these leviticus verses
have to do with anything
what are you doing
getting started
you can keep talking if you want
dont you need to look over these
i got it
cat
howd you get in
no one has asked me about
magda in over 40 years
why would a lady like you want
to know about an awful murder
it interests me
does it
her husband was the first suspect
the husband is always
the first suspect and usually the last
but not this time
we moved on to a neighbor
then a vagrant
once you get to strangers
its only a matter of time
before you get to gypsies and you
know youre never going to solve it
how exactly was she killed
miss
salander
miss salander i hope you dont mind
me asking but when did you last eat
i have a high metabolism
i cant put on weight
im asking because it is better to look
at what i am about to show you
on an empty stomach
if a mans offering is a lamb
it shall be a female without blemish
he should lay his hand
upon its head
slaughter it empty its blood
on the base of the altar
and he shall be forgiven
how is he
he needs surgery
but theres no dnr in place
so its up to the family to decide
should the occasion arise
whether to resuscitate or not
and theyre not good at decisions
so how was it with miss salander
she said yes do you think
i might be able to see him
he was asleep the last time i looked
but let me check
thank you
dont check
tell him to pack his things
and leave
mother please
dont use that tone with me
isabella mr blomkvist
works for henrik
we should put this to a vote
dont be an idiot birger
we all know what henrik wants
can we just do that
henrik is fighting for his life in there
this is the last thing he needs
excuse me mrs vanger
there is no smoking in here
go back to stockholm
when we need a family chronicle
written by a libelist
we know who to call
all right thanks
this way miss
if a woman approaches any beast
and lies with it you shall kill
the woman and the beast
their blood shall be upon them
my familys impossible
thats why the companys
such a mess
i apologize for my
mothers behavior
im used to it
it has nothing to do with you
its between her and henrik
she lost it when my father died
and her drinking and her
got so bad henrik took me
and my sister away from her
and left her excommunicated
in the old house
on the other side of the island
she hasnt forgiven him
you must stay
youre the last chance henrik has
at some kind of resolution
put this to rest one way or another
ill keep my mother away
but please hurry
of course
lisbeth
ill get that
its okay
martin vanger
how do you do
fine
its a girlfriend or
assistant

matching leviticus 2018

having her sickness
he has made naked her fountain

the fountain of her blood

rl rakel lunde 1957

head crushed with a rock
leviticus 2027

or sorceress

sara witt 1964

tied to her bed
raped charred in the fire
that burned down her house
leviticus 21 9

herself by playing the harlot
profanes her father
and shall be burned with fire
magda lovisa sjöberg 1960
found in a barn
stabbed and raped with farm tools
the cow in the next stall
had its throat slit
its blood was splashed on her

leviticus 2016
if a woman lies with any beast
you shall kill the woman and the
beast their blood is upon them

well how far back
henrik said i could have access
to everything this is what i need
thats not what he meant
ill sign a nondisclosure statement
just a minute
i think henrik would say yes
thats why he has me to protect
him from himself its insane
what have we got to hide
after 120 years of business
probably a lot
if this is what he needs to finish
he should have permission
what am i looking for
any connections between
vanger industries
and the towns
where the women were killed
and everything about frode
your father was taking pictures
that day that no one has seen
id like to take a look at them
so ask him
i was wondering if you could do that
i dont speak to him

in the same room with him
im not saying you shouldnt be
so you wont help me
sorry

henrik asked me
to ask you something

come on in ill make you a drink
hello martin
shut the door its quite windy
what happened to you
when
just now
i fell in the dark
you dont have a flashlight
ill get you one
i just wasnt being careful thats all
hows the investigation going
nothing new to report
no
dirch says the girl is really clever
maybe shell turn something up
maybe
thank you for that
so what did he say
what
you said henrik asked you
to ask me something
well i just did
what
hows the investigation
oh yeah
that was his question
do you hunt
we should go hunting
together sometime
sure
nothing at all new to report
no nothing
i can see youre anxious
no
no i mean to get home
after the walk
yeah well i suppose i am
to have dinner with your girlfriend
assistant
well have better luck with a gun
im sorry
when we go hunting
a gun rather than a knife
i want to show you something
bring your drink
leave my knife
to the right
hi leave a message ill call
you know whats harder
than shooting someone
just missing him
that was a very good shot
up at the cabin
it didnt work im here
mikael it did work youre here
inside
you spilled your drink
why didnt you just go home
may i
how did you do it
what did you find
we can talk
or we can just get on with it
i found a photograph
no one has seen
of
you
in an uppsala prep school blazer
what does that prove
you lied about
where you were that day
did i
or rather when
so what people lie all the time
it also says that you and lena
andersson were schoolmates
lena
that was a long time ago
wheres this photo now is it with
all the other crap on your desk
theres a copy on my laptop
theres another copy
on a secure website
secure website
thats a lie
how much does the girl know
i hope its as much as you do
thatll make it fun
where is she
stockholm she went this morning
thats a lie
shes at our offices
looking at more old crap
i got a call
from our archives manager
she was very perturbed
with this girl lisbeth
i like that name
lisbeth
so when lisbeth leaves
i will get a call from security
so i can be at your cottage
to greet her
i cant thank you enough
for bringing her to me
hey hey
so what do you wanna know
youre a journalist
ask me questions
what do i do with the girls
thats a good question
well before i do what were doing
sit down relax have a drink
i like that part a lot
having a chat when both of you know
that one of you is going to die
and afterwards i just get rid of them
far out at sea
unlike my father
who left them scattered
all over the place like trophies
thats not very smart if you ask me
well he was a loud
and garish man
frankly he got what he deserved
you cant be a sloppy technician
like that
you cant drink to excess
like he did
this takes discipline
its a science of a thousand details
the planning the execution
its the cleanup
i guess i dont have to tell you
but youre going to create
quite a mess here
let me ask you something
why dont people
trust their instincts
they sense something is wrong
someone is walking too close
behind them
you knew something was wrong
but you came back into the house
did i force you
did i drag you in no
all i had to do was offer you a drink
its hard to believe that
the fear of offending
can be stronger than the fear
of pain but you know what it is
and they always come willingly
and then they sit there
they know its all over
just like you do
but somehow
they still think they have a chance
maybe if i say the right thing
maybe if im polite
if i cry if i beg
and when i see the hope
draining from their face
like it is from yours right now
i can feel myself
getting hard
but you know were not that different
you and i we both have urges
satisfying mine
requires more towels
it might amuse you to know
that while you were upstairs
having moose with me and liv
who by the way
finds me very conventional
i had irina down here in that cage
who is irina you might ask
just another girl
just another immigrant whore
who misses them
your sister wasnt
what
your sister harriet
wasnt just another girl
you found her
what happened to her
you killed her
you useless fucking detective
this too tight to talk
good im tired of talking to you
ive never had a man in here before
in fact ive never touched a man
except my father
that was our duty
harriets and mine
hey
theres a gun
theres a gun on the television
may i kill him
yeah
how come a 23yearold
is a ward of the state
im mentally incompetent
and cant manage daily life
since when have they said that
since i was 12
what happened when you were 12
im sorry
thats none of my business
i tried to kill my father
burned him alive
got about 80 percent of him
i made some coffee
whos that
its harriet
i found it in martins basement
among his souvenirs
no martin didnt deny
killing anyone
but when i mentioned harriet
he was confused
he got angry at me because i couldnt
tell him what had happened to her
he didnt kill her
his father didnt do it
he was dead the year before
what if she did somehow manage
to get away
i mean if
she is still alive
then theres only one person in this
family whod know where she is
fuck me fuck me fuck me
your turn
right
here
hi look im sorry to bother you
what do you want
has no one called you
about
your cousin martin
what about him
he died in a car accident
last thursday theres going
to be a memorial in hedestad
im not interested in any memorial
well i understand
what do you understand
well that you dont care
very much for your family
look i just thought you should know
now i know
howd it go
okay i think
shes on
and shes shopping
shes still playing solitaire
and she hasnt called anyone
no
we have her cell phone too
i was so sure
she was gonna lead us to her
put your hand back in my shirt
theres only one reason
she hasnt called harriet
she cant because harriet is dead
i was just thinking that
just one second
okay
what were you going to say
i was just thinking
there could be one other possibility
well we could absolutely
what is it now
before he died
your brother hung me from a hook
harriet
so you sent the flowers
yes i did
we found in the swedish family
registry that anita was married
but the family never knew did they
no
so im guessing she then came here
on her marriedname passport
and you followed
on her maidenname passport
no actually
it was the other way around
she thought that it was safer
if i traveled with spencer myself
well what did he think about that
nothing only that he loved her
she said if you love me
youll do this and not ask why
and he never did
and they both died 20 years ago
car accident
you found that out too
is that you
i was 14 the first time he raped me
martin
no my father
martin only started after he had died
well why didnt you tell somebody
i did my mother
henrik wouldve done something
i almost told him
but i was afraid
because of what id done
i
you still dont understand do you
a year after the first time
and there were many times
during that year
my father got drunker
than usual one night
and he started bragging
about the women hed killed
he quoted from the bible
as he tore my clothes off
he tied a belt around my neck
he wanted to kill me
i got out of the house
i went down to the dock
he came staggering after me
i could never fight him off
in a small space
but out in the open
i was strong enough
to deal with an old drunk
when it was over
i looked up and martin was
standing there staring at me
and all id accomplished was
substitute one for another
a couple of months later henrik
sent martin to school in uppsala
and i thought that maybe just maybe
the nightmare was finally over
and then i saw him
the day of the parade
across the street
and i knew
that it would never be over
so how did you escape
anita she
she insisted
that i leave everything behind
if i took anything the police might have
suspected that i was still alive
as everyone ate dinner i was no more
than 20 meters away from them
i spent the night there
thats when the search started
in the morning she came to get me
id grown up with that bridge
as my link to home
but all i could think is
if i could just
get away from them
just get past the police
then i might be safe
and i was
until you showed up
youre safe now
how did you get away
someone saved me too
how are you feeling
im fine
thank you anna
i made you a promise
whether you found anything or not
so what do you have to tell me
whats this
hello henrik
i barely remember wennerström
working here much less being fired
how could you
it was such a long time ago
which is kind of more to the point than
the money he embezzled from you
youre referring
to the statute of limitations
but i had no idea this is what
henrik was holding out
if i had i never wouldve let him
bring you up here
he wasnt trying to deceive you
he knows you cant try somebody
35 years after the event
i like henrik but he knows that
a mans reputation means something
he believes that he thought
you could destroy wennerström
in the court of public opinion
the court of public opinion
celebrates peoples bad behavior
hes an elderly man
he promised me
wennerströms carcass on a plate
this isnt even the plate
i cant do anything with this
yes of course
what happened with wennerström
how did he get you
i was stupid i heard something
i got it from an anonymous source
who im now sure
was one of wennerströms lackeys
it was fake
which he easily proved in court
you were emphatic
that the way i looked into your life
was illegal and immoral would you
feel the same about wennerström
go on
i did some work on my own on him
before you hired me
i havent looked at it all
because you
and harrietfuckingvanger
have kept me busy
but i may have something
you may have something
maybe
they launder money
from arms and drug sales
and crime syndicates in russia
and that money accounts for all
but 5 percent of his holdings
the rest ends up in accounts
in the cayman islands
and how do you know this
this time you dont want to know
this time i do want to know
i have access to his computer
and his accountants and lawyers
and how do you have that
i couldve gotten it from a source
inside the company
you didnt
but thats what youll say
and what will you say to me
well that depends
if you really want to know
i do
mikael how did you get access
financial journalist
mikael blomkvist
who this time last year
was convicted of libel
in a stockholm courtroom
doesnt seem to have learned
from his mistakes
or maybe he has
in the current issue of millennium
magazine he now charges
the company that sued him
the wennerström group
the shit hits the fan
of criminal activities
on a global scale
what happens now
well hell say its a personal vendetta
which wont wash
the police will investigate
fl will investigate
itll go to court
maybe hell go to prison
you think
probably not
these guys never do
whats wrong with you
its embarrassing
tell me
i need to borrow some money
fifty thousand
i have a chance to make an investment
its a smart safe investment
i really dont think ive got 50000
yes you do
you have 65000
in your two accounts
im sorry that i know that
youll get the money back
i promise
okay
you want a coffee
these allegations like the last one
from this socalled journalist
are as ridiculous
as they are untrue
ill be seeing mr blomkvist in court
again and im looking forward to it
what about his documentation
fabricated all of it
the securities fraud office isnt quite
as certain as mr wennerström of that
if a fraction of what mr blomkvist
alleges proves to be true
not only will there be
a securities investigation
but an organizedcrime inquiry
as well
mr blomkvist names no sources
and we cant force him to
