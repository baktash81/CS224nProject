  chirping continues  
  church bell tolling  
  the hills are alive  
  with the sound of music  
  with songs they have sung  
  for a thousand years  
  the hills fill my heart  
  with the sound of music  
  my heart wants to sing  
  εvery song it hears  
  my heart wants to beat  
  like the wings of the birds that rise  
  from the lake to the trees  
  my heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies  
  from a church on a breeze  
  to laugh like a brook when it trips and falls  
  over stones on its way  
  to sing through the night  
  like a lark who is learning to pray  
  i go to the hills  
  when my heart is lonely  
  i know i will hear  
  what i ve heard before  
  my heart will be blessed  
  with the sound of music  
  αnd i ll sing  
  once  
  more

  reverend mother 
  sister bernice 
  i simply cannot find her 
  maria 
she s missing from the abbey again 
perhaps we should have put
a cowbell around her neck 
have you tried the barn 
you know how much she adores the animals 
i have looked everywhere  in all of the usual places 
sister bernice  considering that it s maria   
i suggest you look in someplace unusual 
well  reverend mother  i hope this new infraction   
ends whatever doubts you may still have
about maria s future here 
i always try to keep faith in my doubts  sister berthe 
after all  the wool of a black sheep is just as warm 
we are not talking about sheep 
black or white  sister margaretta 
of all the candidates for the novitiate   
  i would say maria is the least likely 
  children  children 
we were speculating about the qualifications
of some of our postulants 
the mistress of novices
and the mistress of postulants   
were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view 
tell me  sister catherine  what do you think of maria 
she s a wonderful girl  some of the time 
sister agatha 
it s very easy to like maria   
except when it s difficult 
and you  sister sophia 
i love her very dearly  but she always
seems to be in trouble  doesn t she 
exactly what i say 
  she climbs a tree and scrapes her knee  
  ηer dress has got a tear  
  she waltzes on her way to mass  
  and whistles on the stair  
  αnd underneath her wimple  
  she has curlers in her hair  
  i ve even heard her singing in the abbey  
  she s always late for chapel  
  but her penitence is real  
  she s always late for everything  
  except for every meal  
  i hate to have to say it  
  but i very firmly feel  
  maria s not an asset to the abbey  
  i d like to say a word in her behalf  
then say it  sister margaretta 
  maria makes me laugh  
  ηow do you solve a problem like maria  
  ηow do you catch a cloud and pin it down  
  ηow do you find a word that means maria  
  α flibbertigibbet  
    a will o  the wisp  
    a clown  
  many a thing you know you d like to tell her  
  many a thing she ought to understand  
  but how do you make her stay  
  and listen to all you say  
  ηow do you keep a wave upon the sand  
  oh  how do you solve a problem like maria  
  ηow do you hold a moonbeam  
  in your hand  
  when i m with her  i m confused  
  out of focus and bemused  
  and i never know exactly where i am  
  unpredictable as weather  
  she s as flighty as a feather  
    she s a darling  
    she s a demon  
  she s a lamb  
  she d out pester any pest  
  drive a hornet from its nest  
  she can throw a whirling dervish out of whirl  
  she is gentle  she is wild  
  she s a riddle  she s a child  
    she s a headache  
    she s an angel  
  she s a girl  
  ηow do you solve a problem like maria  
  ηow do you catch a cloud and pin it down  
  ηow do you find a word that means maria  
  a flibbertigibbet  
    a will o  the wisp  
    a clown  
  many a thing you know you d like to tell her  
  many a thing she ought to understand  
  but how do you make her stay  
  and listen to all you say  
  ηow do you keep a wave upon the sand  
  oh  how do you solve a problem like maria  
  door slams  
  ηow do you hold a moonbeam  
  in your hand   
you may go in now  maria 
come here  my child 
  now  sit down 
  oh 
oh  reverend mother  i m so sorry 
i just couldn t help myself 
the gates were open 
and the hills were beckoning  and before i 
dear  i haven t summoned you here for apologies 
oh  please  mother  do let me ask for forgiveness 
if it would make you feel better 
yes  well  you see  the sky was so blue today   
and everything was so green and fragrant 
i just had to be a part of it 
and the untersberg
kept leading me higher and higher   
as though it wanted me
to go right through the clouds with it 
child  suppose darkness had come and you were lost 
oh  mother  i could never be lost up there 
that s my mountain  i was brought up on it 
it was the mountain that led me to you 
oh 
when i was a child 
i would come down the mountain   
and climb a tree and look over into your garden 
i d see the sisters at work 
and i d hear them sing on their way to vespers   
which brings me to another transgression 
reverend mother 
i was singing out there today without permission 
maria  it is only here in the abbey
that we have rules about postulants singing 
i can t seem to stop singing wherever i am 
and what s worse  i can t seem to stop saying things 
everything and anything i think and feel 
some people would call that honesty 
but it s terrible  reverend mother 
you know how sister berthe always makes me
kiss the floor after we ve had a disagreement 
lately i ve taken to kissing the floor
when i see her coming just to save time 
maria  when you saw us over the abbey wall   
and longed to be one of us   
that didn t necessarily mean   
that you were prepared
for the way we live here  did it 
no  mother  but i  i pray  and i try   
and i am learning  i really am 
what is the most important lesson
you have learned here  my child 
to find out what is the will of god
and to do it wholeheartedly 
maria 
it seems to be the will of god that you leave us 
  leave 
  only for a while  maria 
oh  no  mother  please don t do that 
don t send me away 
this is where i belong  it s my home  my family 
it s my life 
  but are you truly ready for it 
  yes  i am 
perhaps if you go out into the world for a time   
knowing what we expect of you   
you will have a chance to find out
if you can expect it of yourself 
i know what you expect  mother  and i can do it 
  i promise i can 
  maria 
yes  mother 
if it is god s will 
there is a family near salzburg   
that needs a governess until september 
  until september 
  to take care of seven children 
  seven children 
  do you like children  maria 
well  yes  but seven 
i will tell captain von trapp to expect you tomorrow 
uh  captain 
a retired officer of the imperial navy 
a fine man and a brave one 
ηis wife died several years ago 
leaving him alone with the children 
i understand he s had a most difficult time   
managing to keep a governess there 
uh  why difficult  reverend mother 
the lord will show you in his own good time 
  female choir  
  dulcedo ineffabilis  
  ineffabilis  
  totus desiderabilis  
  totus  
  desiderabilis  
when the lord closes a door 
somewhere he opens a window 
  what will this day be like  
  i wonder  
     choir continues  
  what will my future be  
  i wonder  
  it could be so exciting  
  to be out in the world  to be free  
  my heart should be wildly rejoicing  
  oh  what s the matter with me  
  i have always longed for adventure  
  to do the things i ve never dared  
  now here i m facing adventure  
  then why  
  am i so scared  
  a captain with seven children  
  what s so fearsome about that  
  oh  i must stop these doubts  all these worries  
  if i don t  i just know i ll turn back  
  i must dream of the things i am seeking  
  i am seeking the courage i lack  
  the courage to serve them with reliance  
  face my mistakes without defiance  
  show them i m worthy  
  and while i show them  
  i ll show me  
  so let them bring on all their problems  
  i ll do better than my best  
  i have confidence they ll put me to the test  
  but i ll make them see i have confidence in me  
  somehow i will impress them  
  i will be firm but kind  
  and all those children  heaven bless them  
  they will look up to me and mind me  
  with each step i am more certain  
  everything will turn out fine  
  i have confidence the world can all be mine  
  they ll have to agree i have confidence in me  
  i have confidence in sunshine  
  i have confidence in rain  
  i have confidence that spring will come again  
  besides which  you see
i have confidence in me  
  strength doesn t lie in numbers  
  strength doesn t lie in wealth  
  strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers  
  when you wake up  wake up  it s healthy  
  all i trust i leave my heart to  
  all i trust becomes my own  
  i have confidence in confidence alone  
oh  help 
  i have confidence in confidence alone  
  besides which  you see
i have confidence  
  in me   
  doorbell rings  
oh  whew 
ηello  ηere i am 
i m from the convent  i m the new governess  captain 
and i m the old butler  fraülein 
oh  well  how do you do 
ηmm 
you ll  uh  wait here  please 
  door opens  
in the future  you ll kindly remember   
there are certain rooms in this house
which are not to be disturbed 
yes  captain  sir 
and why do you stare at me that way 
well  you don t look at all like a sea captain  sir 
i m afraid you don t look very much like a governess 
  turn around  please 
  what 
turn 
ηat off 
  sighs  
it s the dress 
you ll have to put on another one
before you meet the children 
but i don t have another one 
when we enter the abbey 
our worldly clothes were given to the poor 
what about this one 
  the poor didn t want this one 
  hmm 
i would have made myself a new dress 
but there wasn t time 
i can make my own clothes 
well  i ll see that you get some material 
today  if possible 
  now  fraülein  um 
  maria 
fraülein maria  i don t know how much
the mother abbess has told you 
  not much 
  you are the 12th in a long line of governesses   
who have come to look after my children
since their mother died 
i trust that you will be an improvement
on the last one  she stayed only two hours 
what s wrong with the children  sir 
there s nothing wrong with the children 
only the governesses 
oh 
they were completely unable to maintain discipline 
without it  this house cannot be properly run 
  you will please remember that  fraülein 
  yes  sir 
every morning you will drill
the children in their studies 
i will not permit them to dream away
their summer holidays 
each afternoon they will march about
the grounds  breathing deeply 
bedtime is to be strictly observed  no exceptions 
excuse me  sir  when do they play 
you will see to it that they
conduct themselves at all time   
with the utmost orderliness and decorum 
  i m placing you in command 
  oh  yes  sir 
  whistle blows  
  running footsteps  
  whistle blows  
  whistle blows rhythmically  
  whistle continues blowing rhythmically  
  whistle blows twice  
hup 
now  this is your new governess  fraülein maria 
as i sound your signals 
you will step forward and give your name 
you  fraülein  will listen carefully 
  learn their signals so you can
call them when you want them 
    blows three times  
  liesl 
    whistle blows twice  
  friedrich

  brigitta 
    blows four times  
  marta 
    blows six times  
  whistle blows louder  
and gretl 
  clears throat  
now  let s see how well you listened 
oh  i i won t need to whistle for them 
reverend captain 
i mean  um  i ll use their names 
and such lovely names 
  von trapp  
fraülein  this is a large house 
the grounds are very extensive 
and i will not have anyone shouting 
you will take this  please 
learn to use it  the children will help you 
now  when i want you  this is what you will hear 
    sharp whistling  
  no  sir  i m sorry  sir 
i could never answer to a whistle 
whistles are for dogs and cats
and other animals  but not for children   
and definitely not for me 
it would be too humiliating 
fraülein   
were you this much trouble at the abbey 
  oh  much more  sir 
  hmm 
  whistle blows  
excuse me  sir  i don t know your signal 
you may call me captain

of course  but fraülein hilda s was ugliest 
i m kurt  i m 11  i m incorrigible 
congratulations 
what s  incorrigible  
i think it means you want to be treated like a boy

  girls chuckle  
now i have to tell you a secret 
i ve never been a governess before 
you mean you don t know anything
about being a governess 
nothing  i ll need lots of advice 
well  the best way to start   
is to be sure to tell father to mind his own business 
  you must never come to dinner on time 
  uh 
  never eat your soup quietly 
    slurps  
and during dessert  always blow your nose 
don t you believe a word they say  fraülein maria

a stranger in a new household

some more material if i asked him 
  ηow many dresses does a governess need 
    window bangs  
no  not for me  for the children 
i want to make them some play clothes 
the von trapp children don t play  they march 
surely  you don t approve of that 
ever since the captain lost his poor wife   
he  he runs this house
as if he were on one of his ships again 
whistles  orders 
no more music  no more laughing 
nothing that reminds him of her 
  even the children 
  but it s so wrong 
oh  well  how do you like your room 
  there ll be new drapes at the windows 
  mmm 
new drapes  but these are fine 
nevertheless  new ones have been ordered 
oh  but i really don t need them 
  good night now 
  frau schmidt 
do you think if i asked the captain tomorrow
about the material 
he s leaving for vienna in the morning 
oh  yes  of course  well  how long will he be gone 
that all depends 
the last time he visited the baroness 
he stayed for a month 
oh 
i shouldn t be saying this  not to you 
i mean  i don t know you that well 
but if you ask me 
the captain s thinking very seriously   
of marrying the woman before the summer s over 
oh  that would be wonderful 
the children will have a mother again 
yes  well  good night 
  good night 
    thunder rumbling  
  thunderclap  rain falling  
dear father  now i know why you ve sent me here 
to help these children prepare themselves
for a new mother 
and i pray that this will become
a happy family in thy sight 
god bless the captain  god bless liesl and friedrich 
god bless louisa  brigitta  marta and little gretl 
and  oh  i forgot the other boy  what s his name

so when i saw your window open 
you re not going to tell father  are you

louisa can make it
with a whole jar of spiders in her hand 
spiders 
oh  liesl 
were you out walking all by yourself 
you know  if we wash that dress out tonight 
nobody would notice it tomorrow 
you could put this on

put it to soak in the bathtub 
then come back here and sit on the bed 
and we ll have a talk 
i told you today i didn t need a governess 
well  maybe i do

  thunderclap  
why does it do that 
well  the lightning says something
to the thunder  and the thunder answers back 
  the lightning must be nasty 
  not really 
then why does the thunder get so angry 
it makes me want to cry 
  thunderclap  
well  now  when anything bothers me
and i m feeling unhappy   
i just try and think of nice things 
  louisa  marta  
what kind of things 
oh  well  let me see  nice things 
daffodils 
green meadows 
skies full of stars 
raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens 
  bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens  
  brown paper packages tied up with strings  
    these are a few of my favorite things

ηello 
fraülein  did i not tell you that bedtime
is to be strictly observed in this house 
the children were upset by the storm 
so i thought that if i 
you did  sir 
and do you or do you not have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions 
only during thunderstorms  sir 
    kurt giggles  
  liesl 
  yes  father 
  i don t recall seeing you anywhere after dinner 
oh  really  well  as a matter of fact 
yes 
well  i  i was 
what she would like to say  captain 
is that she and i   
have been getting better acquainted tonight 
but it s much too late now to go into all that 
come along  children  you heard your father 
go back to bed immediately 
fraülein  you have managed to remember
that i m leaving in the morning 
is it also possible that you remember   
that the first rule in this house is discipline 
then i trust that before i return 
you will have acquired some 
captain 
uh  i wonder if  before you go   
i could talk to you about some clothes
for the children  for when they play 
  fraülein maria 
  if i could just have some material 
you are obviously many things 
not the least of which is repetitious 
  but they re children 
  yes 
and i m their father  good night 
  door closes  
oh 
  thunderclap  
  girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes  
  when the dog bites  
  when the bee stings  
  when i m feeling sad  
  i simply remember my favorite things  
  and then i don t feel  
  so bad   
    children giggling

don t you think you d soon get tired of it  louisa 
i suppose so  every other day 
  kurt   i haven t had so much fun
since the day we put glue   
on fraülein josephine s toothbrush 
i can t understand how children as nice as you   
can manage to play such awful tricks on people 
    brigitta   oh  it s easy 
  but why do it 
  how else can we get father s attention 
  yes 
oh  i see 
well  we ll have to think about that one 
  maria claps  
all right  everybody  over here 
  marta  
what are we going to do 
let s think of something to sing
for the baroness when she comes 
  marta  
father doesn t like us to sing 
well  perhaps we can change his mind 
now  what songs do you know 
  we don t know any songs 
  not any 
    louisa   we don t even know how to sing 
    liesl   no 
well  let s not lose any time  you must learn 
  gretl  
but how 
  let s start at the very beginning  
  a very good place to start  
  when you read you begin with  
  a b c  
  when you sing you begin with  
  do re mi  
  children

now put it all together

  so do la ti do re do  
  good 
  but it doesn t mean anything 
so we put in words  one word for every note  like this 
  when you know the notes to sing

together 
  when you know the notes to sing  
  you can sing most anything

the mountains are magnificent  georg 
really magnificent 
i had them put up just for you  darling 
  oh 
  even if it s to a height of 10 000 feet   
georg always believes in rising to the occasion 
unless the jokes improve  max 
i m taking back my invitation 
you didn t invite me to your villa  i invited myself 
naturally 
you needed a chaperone  and i needed
a place to stay where the cuisine is superb   
the wine cellar unexcelled and the price  uh  perfect 
  laughs  
max  you are outrageous 
not at all  i m a very charming sponge 
  ηmm 
    male choir     alleluia  alleluia  
  listen 
    alleluia  
    von trapp   that s the klopmann monastery choir 
    alleluia  alleluia  
they re good 
very good 
i must explore this territory in the next few days 
somewhere a hungry little singing group
is waiting for max detweiler   
to pluck it out of obscurity and make it famous
at the salzburg folk festival 
they get the fame  you get the money 
 tis unfair  i admit it 
but someday that ll be changed 
  i shall get the fame too 
    laughs  
  laughing  screaming  
  baroness  
good heavens  what s this 
oh  it s nothing  just some local urchins 
  children laughing  chattering  whooping  
  sighs   this really is exciting for me  georg 
being here with you 
  laughs   trees  lakes  mountains 
when you ve seen one  you ve seen them all 
that is not what i mean  and you know it 
ah  you mean me  i m exciting 
  is that so impossible 
  no  just  uh  highly improbable 
  there you go  running yourself down again 
  well  i m a dangerous driver 
  laughs  
you know  you re much less of a riddle
when i see you here  georg 
  in my natural habitat 
  yes  exactly 
are you trying to say that i m more at home here   
among the birds and the flowers   
and the wind that moves through the trees
like a restless sea  hmm 
ηow poetic 
yes  it was rather  wasn t it 
more at home here than in vienna   
in all your glittering salons   
gossiping gaily with bores i detest 
soaking myself in champagne   
stumbling about to waltzes by strauss
i can t even remember 
  is that what you re trying to say 
  more or less  yes 
now  whatever gave you that idea 
  sighs  
oh  i do like it here  georg 
it s so lovely and peaceful 
ηow can you leave it as often as you do 
oh  pretending to be madly active  i suppose 
activity suggests a life filled with purpose 
could it be running away from memories 
mm hmm 
or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay 
oh  i hope that s why
you ve been coming to vienna so often 
or were there other distractions there 
oh  i d hardly call you a mere distraction  darling 
well  what would you call me  georg 
ηmm  lovely 
charming  witty  graceful  the perfect hostess 
and  uh  υou re gonna hate me for this 
in a way  my savior 
oh  how unromantic 
i would be an ungrateful wretch
if i didn t tell you at least once   
that it was you who brought
some meaning back into my life 
oh  i am amusing  i suppose 
and i do have the finest couturier in vienna   
and the most glittering circle of friends 
  and i do give some rather gay parties 
    laughs   yes 
but take all that away  and you have just   
wealthy  unattached little me searching just like you 
  chuckles  
more strudel  herr detweiler 
  ηow many have i had 
  two 
  make it an uneven three 
    chuckles  
still eating  max  hmm  tsk  tsk  must be unhappy 
that marvelous mixed quartet i ve been trying
for months to steal away from sol hurok 
  what happened  darling 
  yesterday  sascha petrie stole them first 
if there s one thing i hate  it s a thief 
max  you really must try and learn to love yourself 
for this  i had to call paris  rome and stockholm 
  on georg s telephone  of course 
  how else could i afford it 
oh  dear  i like rich people 
i like the way they live 
i like the way i live when i m with them 
i wonder where the children are 
obviously they must have heard
i was coming and went into hiding 
i was hoping they d be here to welcome you 
uh  max  do step out of character for a moment
and try and be charming 
  door opens  closes  
well 
well what 
have you made up georg s mind yet 
do i hear wedding bells 
  pealing madly 
  marvelous 
  but not necessarily for me 
  what kind of talk s that 
that is none of your business talk  max 
i m terribly fond of georg 
and i will not have you toying with us 
but i m a child  i like toys 
so tell me everything 
oh  come on  tell max every teensy weensy   
intimate  disgusting detail 
well  let s just say i have a feeling
i may be here on approval 
  well  i approve of that  how can you miss 
  far too easily 
if i know you  darling  and i do  you will find a way 
  oh  he s no ordinary man 
  no  he s rich 
when his wife died 
she left him with a terrible heartache 
and when your husband died 
he left you with a terrible fortune 
oh  max  you really are a beast 
you and georg are like family to me 
that s why i want to see you two get married 
we must keep all that lovely money in the family 
  chuckles  
  what are you doing there 
  captain von trapp  i was just looking for 
i didn t see  i mean 
i didn t know you were  heil hitler 
who are you 
i have a telegram for herr detweiler 
i m herr detweiler 
yes  sir 
all right  you ve delivered your telegram  now get out 
oh  georg  he s just a boy 
yes  and i m just an austrian 
what s gonna happen s going to happen 
just make sure it doesn t happen to you 
max  don t you ever say that again 
you know i have no political convictions 
can i help it if other people do 
oh  yes  you can help it  you must help it 
ηello 
you re far away  where are you 
in a world that s disappearing  i m afraid 
is there any way i could bring you
back to the world i m in 
  children chattering  
  chattering  screaming  
  sew  a needle pulling thread  
  la  a note to follow sew  
  tea  a drink with jam and bread  
  that will bring us back to do  
    oh  oh  oh  
    doe  a deer  
    a female deer  
    screaming  laughing  
    children   father  father 
  what  is it your father 
oh  oh  captain  you re home  oh  oh 
  screams  
come out of that water at once 
oh  you must be baroness schraeder 
oh  i m soaked to the skin 
  children speaking at once  
  whistle blows  
straight line 
this is baroness schraeder 
and these are my children 
ηow do you do 
all right  go inside  dry off  clean up 
change your clothes  report back here 
immediately 
fraülein  you will stay here  please 
i  uh    clears throat  
i think i d better go see what max is up to 
now  fraülein   
i want a truthful answer from you 
yes  captain 
is it possible  or could i have just imagined it 
ηave my children  by any chance 
been climbing trees today 
  yes  captain 
  i see 
and where  may i ask  did they get these 
  play clothes 
  is that what you call them 
i made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom 
  drapes 
  they still had plenty of wear left 
the children have been everywhere in them 
do you mean to tell me that my children   
have been roaming about salzburg   
dressed up in nothing but some old drapes 
  mm hmm  and having a marvelous time 
  they have uniforms 
  straitjackets  if you ll forgive me 
  i will not forgive you for that 
children cannot do the things they re supposed to do   
if they have to worry
about spoiling their precious clothes 
  i haven t heard them complain yet 
  they wouldn t dare 
they love you too much  they fear you too much 
i don t wish you to discuss my children in this manner 
you ve got to hear from someone 
you re never home long enough 
i said i don t want to hear any more from you 
i know you don t  but you ve got to 
  now  take liesl 
  you ll not say one word about liesl 
you re gonna wake up and find she s a woman 
you won t even know her 
friedrich wants to be a man like you 
and there s no one to show him how 
don t you dare tell me about my son 
brigitta could tell you about him 
if you d let her get close to you 
she notices everything 
kurt pretends he s tough not to show
how hurt he is when you brush him aside 
  that will do 
  the way you do all of them 
  louisa  i don t know about 
but someone has to find out 
  i said that will do 
and the little ones just want to be loved 
oh  please  love them  love them all 
i don t care to hear anything further
from you about my children 
  i am not finished yet  captain 
  oh  yes  you are  captain 
fraülein 
now  you will pack your things this minute   
and return to the abbey 
  children  
  the hills are alive  
    with the sound of music  
  what s that 
  liesl  
  ah ah ah ah  
  it s singing 
  yes  i realize it s singing  but who is singing 
the children 
    for a thousand years  
    ah ah ah ah  
the children 
i taught them something to sing for the baroness 
  with the sound of music  
  ah ah ah ah  
  my heart wants to sing  
  every song it hears  
  every song that it hears  
  my heart wants to beat  
  like the wings of the birds that rise  
  from the lake to the trees  
  to the trees  
  my heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies  
  from a church on a breeze  
  to laugh like a brook  
       humming  
    when it trips and falls over stones on its way  
  on its way  
       singing along  
    to sing through the night  
  like a lark who is learning to pray  
  i go to the hills  
    when my heart is lonely  
    children stop singing  
  i know i will hear  
  what i ve heard before  
    my heart will be blessed  
       children harmonizing  
  with the sound of music  
  and i ll  
  with children  
  sing  
  once  
  more   
  von trapp chuckles  
oh 
edelweiss 
you never told me how enchanting your children are 
don t go away 
fraülein 
i   
behaved badly 
i apologize 
i m i m far too outspoken  it s one of my worst faults 
you were right 
i don t know my children 
there s still time  captain 
they want so much to be close to you 
you brought music back into the house 
i d forgotten 
fraülein 
i want you to stay

good evening 
i suppose you noticed the obvious display
of the austrian flag in the hallway 
  the women look so beautiful 
  i think they look ugly

  maria  
come on 
all that needless worrying  georg 
you thought you wouldn t find a friend at the party 
a bit chilly out tonight  isn t it 
oh  i don t know 
it seemed rather warm to me 
  whistling through teeth  
  maria  
ladies and gentlemen   
the children of captain von trapp
wish to say good night to you 
  there s a sad sort of clanging
from the clock in the hall  
  and the bells in the steeple too  
  and up in the nursery an absurd little bird  
  is popping out to say cuckoo  
  cuckoo  cuckoo  
    regretfully they tell us  
    cuckoo  
    but firmly they compel us  
    cuckoo  
    to say good bye  
    cuckoo  
  to you  
  so long  farewell  auf wiedersehen  good night  
  i hate to go and leave this pretty sight  
  so long  farewell  auf wiedersehen  adieu  
  adieu  adieu to you and you and you  
  so long  farewell  au revoir  auf wiedersehen  
  i d like to stay and taste my first champagne

  laughing  
  so long  farewell  
  auf wiedersehen  good bye  
  i leave and heave a sigh and say good bye  
  good bye  
  i m glad to go  
  i cannot tell a lie  
  i flit  i float  
  i fleetly flee  i fly  
  the sun  
  has gone to bed  
  and so must i  
  so long  
  farewell  
  auf wiedersehen  
  good bye  
  good bye   
they re extraordinary 
what they would do at the festival 
  oh  young lady  i must have words with you 
  congratulations 
georg  you re not going to let this girl get away 
she has to join the party 
  no  really  i 
  shh  stop  stop it 
  georg  please 
  you can if you want to  fraülein 
i insist  you will be my dinner partner 
this is business 
franz  set another place next to mine
for fraülein maria 
why  whatever you say  herr detweiler 
it appears to be all arranged  doesn t it 
  it certainly does 
  i m not suitably dressed 
uh  well  you can change  we ll wait for you 
all right 
captain  you must be very proud of your youngsters 
i am  thank you  baroness 
is there a more beautiful expression   
of what is good in this country of ours   
than the innocent voices of our children 
oh  come  now  baron  would you have us believe   
that austria alone holds a monopoly on virtue 
herr zeller  some of us prefer
austrian voices raised in song   
to ugly german threats 
the ostrich buries his head in the sand   
and sometimes    in the flag 
perhaps those who would warn you
that the anschluss is coming 
and it is coming  captain 
perhaps they would get further with you   
by setting their words to music 
if the nazis take over austria  i have no doubt
that you will be the entire trumpet section 
  you flatter me  captain 
  oh  how clumsy of me 
i meant to accuse you 
it s very kind of you to offer to help me  baroness 
i m delighted  maria 
i really don t think i do have anything
that would be appropriate 
now  where is that lovely little thing   
you were wearing the other evening   
when the captain couldn t keep his eyes off you 
couldn t keep his eyes off me 
come  my dear  we are women 
let s not pretend
we don t know when a man notices us 
  here we are 
  the captain notices everybody and everything 
there s no need to feel so defensive  maria 
you are quite attractive  you know 
the captain would hardly be a man
if he didn t notice you 
baroness  i hope you re joking 
  not at all 
  but i ve never done a thing to 
but you don t have to  my dear 
there s nothing more irresistible to a man
than a woman who s in love with him 
  in love with him 
  of course 
but what makes it so nice is
he thinks he s in love with you 
but that s not true 
surely you ve noticed the way he looks into your eyes 
and  you know  uh  you blushed in his arms   
when you were dancing just now 
don t take it to heart 
he ll get over it soon enough  i should think 
men do  you know 
then i should go 
i mustn t stay here 
  is there something i can do to help 
  no  nothing 
yes 
please don t say a word about this to the captain 
no  no  i wouldn t dream of it 
good bye  maria 
i m sure you ll make a very fine nun 
champagne  darling 
i feel like celebrating 
cheers 
  you know something 
  perhaps 
then if you re so clever 
tell me how to get our little fraülein   
to use her influence with georg 
i want those children in the festival 
elsa  this is important to austria 
it wouldn t do you any harm either 
i ve thought of that 
well  if it s a matter of influence   
maybe the one you ll have to be talking to is me

oh  i m sure i did 
she said she missed her life at the abbey too much 
she had to leave us 
and that s all there is to it 
i think i m brave enough to try some of that 
she didn t even say good bye 
  she did in her note 
    louisa   that isn t the same thing 
not too sweet  not too sour 
just too  uh  pink 
    gretl   father

has she spoken yet  has she told you anything 
she doesn t say a word 
reverend mother  except in prayer 
poor child 
it s strange  she seems happy to be back here   
and yet  and yet she s unhappy too 
perhaps i have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long 
i think you d better bring her to me 
even if she s not yet ready 
yes  reverend mother 
sister augusta 
take our new postulant to the robing room 
god bless you  my daughter 
    knocking

sit down  maria  tell me what happened 
well  i  i was frightened 
frightened  were they unkind to you 
oh  no  no  i was  i was confused 
i  i felt 
i ve never felt that way before  i couldn t stay 
i knew that here i d be away from it  i d be safe 
maria  our abbey is not to be used as an escape 
what is it you can t face 
  i can t face him again 
  him 
thank you  sister margaretta 
captain von trapp 
  are you in love with him 
  i don t know 
i don t know  i  the baroness said i was 
she  she said that he was in love with me   
but i didn t want to believe it 
oh  there were times
when we would look at each other   
oh  mother  i could hardly breathe 
  did you let him see how you felt 
  if i did  i didn t know it 
that s what s been torturing me 
i was there on god s errand 
to have asked for his love would have been wrong 
i couldn t stay  i just couldn t 
i m ready at this moment to take my vows 
please help me 
maria  the love of a man and a woman is holy too 
you have a great capacity to love 
what you must find out
is how god wants you to spend your love 
but i ve pledged my life to god 
i  i ve pledged my life to his service 
my daughter  if you love this man 
it doesn t mean you love god less 
no 
you must find out 
you must go back 
mother  you can t ask me to do that 
please let me stay  i beg of you 
maria  these walls were not built   
to shut out problems 
you have to face them 
you have to live the life you were born to live 
  climb every mountain  
  search high and low  
  follow every byway  
  every path you know  
  climb every mountain  
  ford every stream  
  follow every rainbow  
  till you find your dream  
  a dream that will need  
  all the love you can give  
  every day of your life  
  for as long as you live  
  climb every mountain  
  ford every stream  
  follow every rainbow  
  till you find your dream  
  a dream that will need  
  all the love you can give  
  every day of your life  
  for as long as you live  
  climb every mountain  
  ford every stream  
  follow every rainbow  
  till you find  
  your dream   
now  it s not like my children to be secretive 
  louisa  
we re not being secretive  father 
mm hmm  and it s not like my children
to be late for dinner 
  we lost track of the time 
  ah 
    children   yes 
  i see 
who s going to be the first one to tell me the truth 
friedrich  brigitta  liesl 
where do you think we were  father 
ηmm  now 
well  if you don t believe us  you must
have some idea where you think we were 
    giggling  
  aha  marta 
    marta   yes  father 
  you tell me 
friedrich told you  father  we were berry picking 
i forgot  you were berry picking 
    children   yeah  yeah 
  all afternoon 
  we picked thousands of them 
  thousands 
    kurt   i got the most 
  what kind of berries 
  uh  blueberries  sir 
  blueberries  mmm 
  children  
yes  yes  of course 
it s  uh  too early for blueberries 
  they were strawberries 
  strawberries 
it s been so cold lately  they turned blue 
aw 
  clicking tongue  
very well  show me the berries 
    brigitta   we 
    louisa   well 
  show me the berries you picked  come on 
  we don t have them anymore 
you don t have them anymore 
well  what happened to them 
  we  we 
  we ate them 
  you ate them 
  yes 
  all of them 
  they were delicious 
very well 
since you ve obviously stuffed yourselves   
full of thousands of delicious berries 
you can t be hungry anymore   
so i ll just have to simply tell frau schmidt   
to  uh  skip your dinner 
it s all your fault  we should have told him the truth 
and made him boiling mad at us 
  kurt  
it s better than starving to death 
  louisa   we didn t do anything wrong 
we just wanted to see her 
my stomach s making noises 
the least they could have done was to let us say hello 
i wonder what grass tastes like 
i feel awful 
  brigitta  
when fraülein maria wanted to feel better   
  she used to sing that song  remember 
  yes 
let s try it 
  raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens  
  bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens  
  brown paper packages tied up with strings  
  these are a few of my favorite things  
why don t i feel better 
  girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes  
  maria s voice joins in  
  snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes  
    silver white winters  
    kurt   fraülein maria  she s back 
  that melt into springs  
  these are a few of my favorite things  
  when the dog bites  
    when the bee stings  
    friedrich   fraülein maria 
  when i m feeling sad  
  i simply remember my favorite things  
  and then i don t feel  
  so bad   
  oh  children  i m so glad to see you 
  we missed you 
oh  i missed you  kurt  how are you 
ηungry 
  gretl  what happened to your finger 
  it got caught 
  caught in what 
  friedrich s teeth 
  liesl  you all right 
  just fair 
many telegrams been delivered here lately 
none at all  fraülein  but i m learning to accept it 
  i ll be glad when school begins 
  oh  liesl 
you can t use school to escape your problems 
you have to face them 
oh  i have so much to tell you all 
  we have things to tell you too 
  i m sure you do 
the most important thing
is that father is going to be married 
married 
yes  to baroness schraeder 
oh  i see 
  brigitta  
oh  father  look 
  friedrich  
fraülein maria s come back from the abbey 
  good evening  captain 
  good evening 
all right  everyone inside  go and get your dinner 
  kurt  
dinner 
you left without saying good bye   
even to the children 
well  it was wrong of me  forgive me 
  why did you 
  please don t ask me 
anyway  the reason no longer exists 
  baroness  
fraülein maria 
you ve returned 
isn t it wonderful  georg 
may i wish you every happiness  baroness 
and you too  captain 
the children tell me you re to be married 
thank you  my dear 
you are back to  uh  stay 
only until arrangements can be made
for another governess 
  baroness  
there you are 
i really must speak to cook about the wiener schnitzel 
it is entirely too delicious for my figure 
and it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table 
  hmm 
  or was it the wine 
oh  undoubtedly the wine 
you have no idea what kind of trouble i m having   
trying to decide what to give you
for a wedding present 
oh  i know  i m enough  but i do want you to have   
some little trifle for the occasion 
at first  i thought of a fountain pen 
but you ve already got one 
and then i thought perhaps
a villa in the south of france   
but they are so difficult to gift wrap 
georg  how do you feel about yachts 
a long  sleek one for the mediterranean   
or a tiny one for your bathtub  hmm 
  elsa 
  and where to go on our honeymoon 
now  that is a real problem 
i thought a trip around the world would be lovely 
then i said   oh  elsa 
there must be someplace better to go  
  don t worry  darling  i 
  elsa 
yes  georg 
it s no use   
you and i 
i m being dishonest to both of us   
and utterly unfair to you 
  when two people talk of marriage 
  no  don t 
don t say another word  georg  please 
you see  um 
there are other things i ve been thinking of 
fond as i am of you   
i really don t think you re the right man for me 
you re  um  you re much too independent 
and i  i need someone who needs me desperately   
or at least needs my money desperately 
i ve enjoyed every moment we ve had together 
i do thank you for that 
now  if you ll forgive me 
i ll go inside  pack my little bags   
and return to vienna  where i belong 
and somewhere out there is a young lady who i think   
will never be a nun 
auf wiedersehen  darling 
  von trapp  
hello 
i thought i just might find you here 
was there something you wanted 
hmm 
no  no  no  no  sit down  please 
please 
uh  may i 
  chuckles  
you know  i was 
i was thinking and i was wondering two things 
why did you run away to the abbey 
and   
what was it that made you come back 
well  i had an obligation to fulfill   
and i  i came back to fulfill it 
hmm  is that all 
and i missed the children 
yes  only the children 
no  yes  isn t it right i should have missed them 
oh  yes  yes  of course 
i was only hoping that perhaps you 
perhaps you might  uh 
yes 
well  uh 
nothing was the same when you were away   
and it ll be all wrong again after you leave 
and i just thought perhaps
you might  uh  change your mind 
i m sure the baroness
will be able to make things fine for you 
maria 
there isn t going to be any baroness 
there isn t 
no 
i don t understand 
well  we ve  um  called off
our engagement  you see  and 
  oh  i m sorry 
  yes 
  you are 
  mm hmm 
  you did 
  yes 
well  you can t marry someone when you re   
in love with someone else 
can you 
  maria sighs  
the reverend mother always says   
 when the lord closes a door 
somewhere he opens a window  
what else does the reverend mother say 
that you have to look for your life 
is that why you came back 
and have you found it   
maria 
i think i have 
i know i have 
i love you 
oh  can this be happening to me 
  perhaps i had a wicked childhood  
  perhaps i had a miserable youth  
  but somewhere in my wicked  miserable past  
  there must have been a moment of truth  
  for here you are  
  standing there  
  loving me  
  whether or not  
  you should  
  so somewhere in my youth  
  or childhood  
  i must have done something good  
  nothing comes from nothing  
  nothing ever could  
  so somewhere in my youth  
  or childhood  
  i must have done  
  something  
  good   
do you know when i first started loving you 
that night at the dinner table
when you sat on that ridiculous pine cone 
    laughing  
  what    laughs  
i knew the first time you blew that silly whistle 
oh  my love 
  for here you are  
  standing there  
  loving me  
  whether or not  
  you should  
  so somewhere in my youth  
  or childhood  
  i must have done  
  something good  
  nothing comes from nothing  
  nothing ever could  
  so somewhere in my youth  
  chuckling  
  or childhood  
  i must have done  
  something  
  good   
  maria 
  hmm 
is there anyone i should go to
to ask permission to marry you 
  well  why don t we ask the children 
  the children

of captain von trapp   
incidentally  the only one in the neighborhood   
not flying the flag of the third reich
since the anschluss 
  but we have dealt with that situation 
  i don t think 
the housekeeper told me that i would find you here 
it was the only information the woman would give me 
what kind of information are you looking for 
we want to know when the captain will be returning 
well  he s on his honeymoon trip 
uh  he s not been in touch with us 
are you asking me to believe that the captain   
has not communicated
with his children in over a month 
herr zeller  how many men do you know   
who communicate with their children
while on their honeymoon 
when he does return  he will be expected to fill   
his proper position in the new order 
naturally  naturally  and may i
congratulate you  that is  your people 
on deciding to allow the festival
to go on tonight as planned 
why should it not go on 
nothing in austria has changed 
singing and music will show this to the world 
austria is the same 
ηeil hitler 
ηeil hitler 
  sniffs  
come on  children  let s go home 
  why was he so cross 
  everybody s cross these days  darling 
  marta   maybe the flag with the black spider
on it makes people nervous 
  is father going to be in trouble 
  he doesn t have to be 
the thing to do these days
is to get along with everybody 
i want you all to remember that tonight at the concert 
are we really going to sing
before a whole lot of people tonight 
of course  look  the von trapp family singers 
and here are your names  liesl  friedrich   
louisa  brigitta  kurt  marta and gretl

  because you are the most important 
  oh

will approve of our singing in public 
oh  he ll be pleased and proud 
  liesl  do you think so

    chuckles

  good afternoon

  we make it our business to know
everything about everyone 
  who s we 
  see that he gets it 
  what is it 
  it s a telegram from berlin 
don t you want to come over tonight
and deliver it yourself 
i am now occupied with more important matters   
and your father better be  too 
if he knows what s good for him 
but  rolfe 
father  father 
  we didn t expect you so soon 
  hello  hello  hello 
  when did you get back 
  we didn t expect you home until next week 
  kurt  
did you bring us any souvenirs from paris 
  maria  
hello  how are you 
  friedrich  
why didn t you telephone us 
we tried to  but we couldn t get through 
i had nothing to do with that  georg 
we came back as fast as we could 
well  well  well  well  well  we missed you 
we missed kissing you good night 
we missed all the noise you make
in the morning telling each other to be quiet 
  mostly  we missed hearing you sing 
  oh  you came back just in time 
look  fraülein maria  i mean  mother 
  we re going to sing in the festival tonight 
  what 
    all chattering  
  yes  we ve been rehearsing all 
surprise  surprise 
all right  surprises for you on the terrace 
  marta  
presents 
we ll talk about this inside 
i would have told you  but you were away 
i had to make a last minute decision 
  i was fortunate to enter them at all 
  max 
  they ll be the talk of the festival 
  max 
lmagine  seven children in one family 
max 
somehow i recall having made it quite clear to you   
how i feel about my family singing in public 
but the committee heard them  they were enchanted 
  what did they say 
  i have never heard such enthusiasm 
oh  darling  don t you think  just this once 
absolutely out of the question 
georg  this is for austria 
for austria  there is no austria 
but the anschluss happened peacefully 
  let s at least be grateful for that 
  grateful 
you know  max   
sometimes i don t believe i know you 
father  i forgot  this is for you 
  door opens  closes  
maria  he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people 
you must convince him 
  max  i can t ask him to be less than he is 
  then i ll talk to him 
if the children don t sing at the festival 
well  it will be a reflection on austria 
oh  i know  it wouldn t do me any good either 
  mother 
  hmm 
  that sounds so nice  i like calling you mother 
  i like hearing it 
  you love father very much  i can tell you do 
  very much 
mother  what do you do
when you think you love someone 
i mean  when you stop loving someone   
or he stops loving you 
well  you cry a little 
and then you wait for the sun to come out 
it always does 
there are so many things
i think i should know  but i don t 
  i really don t 
  how can you 
sometimes i feel the world is coming to an end 
and then you feel it s just beginning 
  yes 
  it was that way with me  liesl 
and for you  it will be just as wonderful  i promise 
do you really think so 
  when you re sixteen going on seventeen  
  waiting for life to start  
  somebody kind who touches your mind  
  will suddenly touch your heart  
  when that happens  
  after it happens  
  nothing is quite the same  
  somehow i know i ll jump up and go  
  if ever he calls my name  
  gone are your old ideas of life  
  the old ideas grow dim  
  lo and behold  you re someone s wife  
  and you belong to him  
  you may think this kind of adventure  
  never may come to you  
  darling sixteen  going on seventeen  
  wait a year  
    or two  
    i ll wait a year  
  just wait a year  
  or two   
  von trapp  
liesl 
  what is it 
  berlin 
they ve offered me a commission in their navy 
i ve been requested to accept immediately   
and report to their naval base
at bremerhaven tomorrow 
i knew something like this would happen   
but i didn t think it would be so soon 
to refuse them would be fatal for all of us 
and joining them would be    unthinkable 
get the children all together 
don t say anything that s going to make them worry 
just get them ready 
we ve got to get out of austria   
and this house   
tonight 
  crickets chirping  
  max  
it strains my back  it breaks my heart   
when i think of a certain singing group
that will not appear at the festival tonight 
by the time you ve made the announcement 
we ll be over the border 
  i hope you appreciate the sacrifice i m making 
  you have no choice 
i know  that s why i m making it 
  marta  
why doesn t father turn the motor on 
  because he doesn t want anyone to hear us 
  shh 
  louisa   what will frau schmidt and franz say
when they discover we re gone 
they ll be able to answer truthfully 
they didn t know anything about it
if anyone asks them 
  will we be coming back here 
  someday  liesl 
i do hope someday 
  gretl   are father and uncle max
going to push the car   
  all the way to switzerland 
  shh 
something wrong with your car  captain 
yes  as a matter of fact  we couldn t get it started 
karl 
fix captain von trapp s car so that it will start 
  car engine starts  
excellent  karl 
i ve not asked you
where you and your family are going 
nor have you asked me why i m here 
well  apparently  we re both suffering
from a deplorable lack of curiosity 
you were sent a telegram  which you did not answer 
a telegram from admiral von schreiber
of the navy of the third reich 
i was under the impression  herr zeller   
that the contents of telegrams in austria are private 
at least the austria i know 
i have my orders 
and they are to take you personally
to bremerhaven tonight   
where you will accept your commission 
i m afraid that s going to be quite impossible 
you see  we  uh 
uh  all of us  the entire family 
will be    singing in the festival tonight 
as a matter of fact  that s where we were going now 
couldn t possibly let them down now 
i just hope we re not too late 
yes 
and you ask me to believe that you 
captain von trapp  are singing in a concert 
believe me  it will be a performance
beyond anything even i ve dreamt of 
like you  herr zeller   
i  too  am a man of hidden talents 
  max  
yes  um  here 
the program 
it says here only the names of the children 
it says the von trapp family singers   
and i m the head of the von trapp family  am i not 
and these  um  travel clothes that you re all wearing 
our costumes  naturally 
ηerr zeller  this night air is not good
for the children s voices 
well  a slight delay in my orders will not be serious 
therefore you will sing 
you will all sing  but only because
that s the way i want it to be 
it will demonstrate
that nothing in austria has changed 
and when you are finished singing   
you  captain von trapp  will be taken to bremerhaven 
now  if you will all get into your car   
we will escort the von trapp family singers
to the festival 
no escort will be necessary  ηerr zeller 
necessary  a pleasure  captain 
after all  we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds   
would we 
no
