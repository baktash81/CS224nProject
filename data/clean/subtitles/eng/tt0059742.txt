chirping continues
church bell tolling
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
with songs they have sung
for a thousand years
the hills fill my heart
with the sound of music
my heart wants to sing
εvery song it hears
my heart wants to beat
like the wings of the birds that rise
from the lake to the trees
my heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
to laugh like a brook when it trips and falls
over stones on its way
to sing through the night
like a lark who is learning to pray
i go to the hills
when my heart is lonely
i know i will hear
what ive heard before
my heart will be blessed
with the sound of music
αnd ill sing
once
more
church bells tolling

reverend mother
sister bernice
i simply cannot find her
maria
shes missing from the abbey again
perhaps we should have put
a cowbell around her neck
have you tried the barn
you know how much she adores the animals
i have looked everywhere in all of the usual places
sister bernice considering that its maria
i suggest you look in someplace unusual
well reverend mother i hope this new infraction
ends whatever doubts you may still have
about marias future here
i always try to keep faith in my doubts sister berthe
after all the wool of a black sheep is just as warm
we are not talking about sheep
black or white sister margaretta
of all the candidates for the novitiate
i would say maria is the least likely
children children
we were speculating about the qualifications
of some of our postulants
the mistress of novices
and the mistress of postulants
were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view
tell me sister catherine what do you think of maria
shes a wonderful girl some of the time
sister agatha
its very easy to like maria
except when its difficult
and you sister sophia
i love her very dearly but she always
seems to be in trouble doesnt she
exactly what i say
she climbs a tree and scrapes her knee
ηer dress has got a tear
she waltzes on her way to mass
and whistles on the stair
αnd underneath her wimple
she has curlers in her hair
ive even heard her singing in the abbey
shes always late for chapel
but her penitence is real
shes always late for everything
except for every meal
i hate to have to say it
but i very firmly feel
marias not an asset to the abbey
id like to say a word in her behalf
then say it sister margaretta
maria makes me laugh
ηow do you solve a problem like maria
ηow do you catch a cloud and pin it down
ηow do you find a word that means maria
α flibbertigibbet
a willothewisp
a clown
many a thing you know youd like to tell her
many a thing she ought to understand
but how do you make her stay
and listen to all you say
ηow do you keep a wave upon the sand
oh how do you solve a problem like maria
ηow do you hold a moonbeam
in your hand
when im with her im confused
out of focus and bemused
and i never know exactly where i am
unpredictable as weather
shes as flighty as a feather
shes a darling
shes a demon
shes a lamb
shed outpester any pest
drive a hornet from its nest
she can throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
she is gentle she is wild
shes a riddle shes a child
shes a headache
shes an angel
shes a girl
ηow do you solve a problem like maria
ηow do you catch a cloud and pin it down
ηow do you find a word that means maria
a flibbertigibbet
a willothewisp
a clown
many a thing you know youd like to tell her
many a thing she ought to understand
but how do you make her stay
and listen to all you say
ηow do you keep a wave upon the sand
oh how do you solve a problem like maria
door slams
ηow do you hold a moonbeam
in your hand
you may go in now maria
come here my child
now sit down
oh
oh reverend mother im so sorry
i just couldnt help myself
the gates were open
and the hills were beckoning and before i
dear i havent summoned you here for apologies
oh please mother do let me ask for forgiveness
if it would make you feel better
yes well you see the sky was so blue today
and everything was so green and fragrant
i just had to be a part of it
and the untersberg
kept leading me higher and higher
as though it wanted me
to go right through the clouds with it
child suppose darkness had come and you were lost
oh mother i could never be lost up there
thats my mountain i was brought up on it
it was the mountain that led me to you
oh
when i was a child
i would come down the mountain
and climb a tree and look over into your garden
id see the sisters at work
and id hear them sing on their way to vespers
which brings me to another transgression
reverend mother
i was singing out there today without permission
maria it is only here in the abbey
that we have rules about postulants singing
i cant seem to stop singing wherever i am
and whats worse i cant seem to stop saying things
everything and anything i think and feel
some people would call that honesty
but its terrible reverend mother
you know how sister berthe always makes me
kiss the floor after weve had a disagreement
lately ive taken to kissing the floor
when i see her coming just to save time
maria when you saw us over the abbey wall
and longed to be one of us
that didnt necessarily mean
that you were prepared
for the way we live here did it
no mother but i i pray and i try
and i am learning i really am
what is the most important lesson
you have learned here my child
to find out what is the will of god
and to do it wholeheartedly
maria
it seems to be the will of god that you leave us
leave
only for a while maria
oh no mother please dont do that
dont send me away
this is where i belong its my home my family
its my life
but are you truly ready for it
yes i am
perhaps if you go out into the world for a time
knowing what we expect of you
you will have a chance to find out
if you can expect it of yourself
i know what you expect mother and i can do it
i promise i can
maria
yes mother
if it is gods will
there is a family near salzburg
that needs a governess until september
until september
to take care of seven children
seven children
do you like children maria
well yes but seven
i will tell captain von trapp to expect you tomorrow
uh captain
a retired officer of the imperial navy
a fine man and a brave one
ηis wife died several years ago
leaving him alone with the children
i understand hes had a most difficult time
managing to keep a governess there
uh why difficult reverend mother
the lord will show you in his own good time
female choir
dulcedo ineffabilis
ineffabilis
totus desiderabilis
totus
desiderabilis
when the lord closes a door
somewhere he opens a window
what will this day be like
i wonder
choir continues
what will my future be
i wonder
it could be so exciting
to be out in the world to be free
my heart should be wildly rejoicing
oh whats the matter with me
i have always longed for adventure
to do the things ive never dared
now here im facing adventure
then why
am i so scared
a captain with seven children
whats so fearsome about that
oh i must stop these doubts all these worries
if i dont i just know ill turn back
i must dream of the things i am seeking
i am seeking the courage i lack
the courage to serve them with reliance
face my mistakes without defiance
show them im worthy
and while i show them
ill show me
so let them bring on all their problems
ill do better than my best
i have confidence theyll put me to the test
but ill make them see i have confidence in me
somehow i will impress them
i will be firm but kind
and all those children heaven bless them
they will look up to me and mind me
with each step i am more certain
everything will turn out fine
i have confidence the world can all be mine
theyll have to agree i have confidence in me
i have confidence in sunshine
i have confidence in rain
i have confidence that spring will come again
besides which you see
i have confidence in me
strength doesnt lie in numbers
strength doesnt lie in wealth
strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers
when you wake up wake up its healthy
all i trust i leave my heart to
all i trust becomes my own
i have confidence in confidence alone
oh help
i have confidence in confidence alone
besides which you see
i have confidence
in me
doorbell rings
oh whew
ηello ηere i am
im from the convent im the new governess captain
and im the old butler fraülein
oh well how do you do
ηmm
youll uh wait here please
door opens
in the future youll kindly remember
there are certain rooms in this house
which are not to be disturbed
yes captain sir
and why do you stare at me that way
well you dont look at all like a sea captain sir
im afraid you dont look very much like a governess
turn around please
what
turn
ηat off
sighs
its the dress
youll have to put on another one
before you meet the children
but i dont have another one
when we enter the abbey
our worldly clothes were given to the poor
what about this one
the poor didnt want this one
hmm
i would have made myself a new dress
but there wasnt time
i can make my own clothes
well ill see that you get some material
today if possible
now fraülein um
maria
fraülein maria i dont know how much
the mother abbess has told you
not much
you are the 12th in a long line of governesses
who have come to look after my children
since their mother died
i trust that you will be an improvement
on the last one she stayed only two hours
whats wrong with the children sir
theres nothing wrong with the children
only the governesses
oh
they were completely unable to maintain discipline
without it this house cannot be properly run
you will please remember that fraülein
yes sir
every morning you will drill
the children in their studies
i will not permit them to dream away
their summer holidays
each afternoon they will march about
the grounds breathing deeply
bedtime is to be strictly observed no exceptions
excuse me sir when do they play
you will see to it that they
conduct themselves at all time
with the utmost orderliness and decorum
im placing you in command
oh yes sir
whistle blows
running footsteps
whistle blows
whistle blows rhythmically
whistle continues blowing rhythmically
whistle blows twice
hup
now this is your new governess fraülein maria
as i sound your signals
you will step forward and give your name
you fraülein will listen carefully
learn their signals so you can
call them when you want them

friedrich

now when i want you this is what you will hear
sharp whistling

come along children you heard your father
go back to bed immediately
fraülein you have managed to remember
that im leaving in the morning
is it also possible that you remember
that the first rule in this house is discipline

captain

i could talk to you about some clothes

somewhere a hungry little singing group
is waiting for max detweiler
to pluck it out of obscurity and make it famous
at the salzburg folk festival
they get the fame you get the money
tis unfair i admit it
but someday thatll be changed
i shall get the fame too
laughs
laughing screaming
baroness
good heavens whats this
oh its nothing just some local urchins
children laughing chattering whooping
sighs  this really is exciting for me georg
being here with you
laughs  trees lakes mountains
when youve seen one youve seen them all
that is not what i mean and you know it
ah you mean me im exciting
is that so impossible
no just uh highly improbable
there you go running yourself down again
well im a dangerous driver
laughs
you know youre much less of a riddle
when i see you here georg
in my natural habitat
yes exactly
are you trying to say that im more at home here
among the birds and the flowers
and the wind that moves through the trees
like a restless sea hmm
ηow poetic
yes it was rather wasnt it
more at home here than in vienna
in all your glittering salons
gossiping gaily with bores i detest
soaking myself in champagne
stumbling about to waltzes by strauss
i cant even remember
is that what youre trying to say
more or less yes
now whatever gave you that idea
sighs
oh i do like it here georg
its so lovely and peaceful
ηow can you leave it as often as you do
oh pretending to be madly active i suppose
activity suggests a life filled with purpose
could it be running away from memories
mmhmm
or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay
oh i hope thats why
youve been coming to vienna so often
or were there other distractions there
oh id hardly call you a mere distraction darling
well what would you call me georg
ηmm lovely
charming witty graceful the perfect hostess
and uh υoure gonna hate me for this
in a way my savior
oh how unromantic
i would be an ungrateful wretch
if i didnt tell you at least once
that it was you who brought
some meaning back into my life
oh i am amusing i suppose
and i do have the finest couturier in vienna
and the most glittering circle of friends
and i do give some rather gay parties
laughs  yes
but take all that away and you have just
wealthy unattached little me searching just like you
chuckles
more strudel herr detweiler
ηow many have i had
two
make it an uneven three
chuckles
still eating max hmm tsk tsk must be unhappy
that marvelous mixed quartet ive been trying
for months to steal away from sol hurok
what happened darling
yesterday sascha petrie stole them first
if theres one thing i hate its a thief
max you really must try and learn to love yourself
for this i had to call paris rome and stockholm
on georgs telephone of course
how else could i afford it
oh dear i like rich people
i like the way they live
i like the way i live when im with them
i wonder where the children are
obviously they must have heard
i was coming and went into hiding
i was hoping theyd be here to welcome you
uh max do step out of character for a moment
and try and be charming
door opens closes
well
well what
have you made up georgs mind yet
do i hear wedding bells
pealing madly
marvelous
but not necessarily for me
what kind of talks that
that is noneofyourbusiness talk max
im terribly fond of georg
and i will not have you toying with us
but im a child i like toys
so tell me everything
oh come on tell max every teensy weensy
intimate disgusting detail
well lets just say i have a feeling
i may be here on approval
well i approve of that how can you miss
far too easily
if i know you darling and i do you will find a way
oh hes no ordinary man
no hes rich
when his wife died
she left him with a terrible heartache
and when your husband died
he left you with a terrible fortune
oh max you really are a beast
you and georg are like family to me
thats why i want to see you two get married
we must keep all that lovely money in the family
chuckles
what are you doing there
captain von trapp i was just looking for
i didnt see i mean
i didnt know you were heil hitler
who are you
i have a telegram for herr detweiler
im herr detweiler
yes sir
all right youve delivered your telegram now get out
oh georg hes just a boy
yes and im just an austrian
whats gonna happens going to happen
just make sure it doesnt happen to you
max dont you ever say that again
you know i have no political convictions
can i help it if other people do
oh yes you can help it you must help it
ηello
youre far away where are you
in a world thats disappearing im afraid
is there any way i could bring you
back to the world im in
children chattering
chattering screaming
sew a needle pulling thread
la a note to follow sew
tea a drink with jam and bread
that will bring us back to do
oh oh oh
doe a deer
a female deer
screaming laughing
children  father father
what is it your father
oh oh captain youre home oh oh
screams
come out of that water at once
oh you must be baroness schraeder
oh im soaked to the skin
children speaking at once
whistle blows
straight line
this is baroness schraeder
and these are my children
ηow do you do
all right go inside dry off clean up
change your clothes report back here
immediately
fraülein you will stay here please
i uh  clears throat
i think id better go see what max is up to
now fraülein
i want a truthful answer from you
yes captain
is it possible or could i have just imagined it
ηave my children by any chance
been climbing trees today
yes captain
i see
and where may i ask did they get these
play clothes
is that what you call them
i made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom
drapes
they still had plenty of wear left
the children have been everywhere in them
do you mean to tell me that my children
have been roaming about salzburg
dressed up in nothing but some old drapes
mmhmm and having a marvelous time
they have uniforms
straitjackets if youll forgive me
i will not forgive you for that
children cannot do the things theyre supposed to do
if they have to worry
about spoiling their precious clothes
i havent heard them complain yet
they wouldnt dare
they love you too much they fear you too much
i dont wish you to discuss my children in this manner
youve got to hear from someone
youre never home long enough
i said i dont want to hear any more from you
i know you dont but youve got to
now take liesl
youll not say one word about liesl
youre gonna wake up and find shes a woman
you wont even know her
friedrich wants to be a man like you
and theres no one to show him how
dont you dare tell me about my son
brigitta could tell you about him
if youd let her get close to you
she notices everything
kurt pretends hes tough not to show
how hurt he is when you brush him aside
that will do
the way you do all of them
louisa i dont know about
but someone has to find out
i said that will do
and the little ones just want to be loved
oh please love them love them all
i dont care to hear anything further
from you about my children
i am not finished yet captain
oh yes you are captain
fraülein
now you will pack your things this minute
and return to the abbey
children
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
whats that
liesl
ah ah ah ah
its singing
yes i realize its singing but who is singing
the children
for a thousand years
ah ah ah ah
the children
i taught them something to sing for the baroness
with the sound of music
ah ah ah ah
my heart wants to sing
every song it hears
every song that it hears
my heart wants to beat
like the wings of the birds that rise
from the lake to the trees
to the trees
my heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
to laugh like a brook
humming
when it trips and falls over stones on its way
on its way
singing along
to sing through the night
like a lark who is learning to pray
i go to the hills
when my heart is lonely
children stop singing
i know i will hear
what ive heard before
my heart will be blessed
children harmonizing
with the sound of music
and ill
with children
sing
once
more
von trapp chuckles
oh
edelweiss
you never told me how enchanting your children are
dont go away
fraülein
i
behaved badly
i apologize
imim far too outspoken its one of my worst faults
you were right
i dont know my children
theres still time captain
they want so much to be close to you
you brought music back into the house
id forgotten
fraülein
i want you to stay
i ask you to stay
if i could be of any help
you have already more than you know

baroness schraeder
good evening
i suppose you noticed the obvious display
of the austrian flag in the hallway
the women look so beautiful
i think they look ugly
you just say that because youre scared of them
silly only grownup men are scared of women
i think the men look beautiful
ηow would you know
liesl who are you dancing with
nobody
brigitta
oh yes you are
may i have this dance
id be delighted young man
why didnt you children tell me you could dance
we were afraid youd make us all dance together

maria

all that needless worrying georg
you thought you wouldnt find a friend at the party
a bit chilly out tonight isnt it
oh i dont know
it seemed rather warm to me
whistling through teeth
maria
ladies and gentlemen
the children of captain von trapp
wish to say good night to you
theres a sad sort of clanging
from the clock in the hall
and the bells in the steeple too
and up in the nursery an absurd little bird
is popping out to say cuckoo
cuckoo cuckoo
regretfully they tell us
cuckoo
but firmly they compel us
cuckoo
to say goodbye
cuckoo
to you
so long farewell auf wiedersehen good night
i hate to go and leave this pretty sight
so long farewell auf wiedersehen adieu
adieu adieu to you and you and you
so long farewell au revoir auf wiedersehen

auf wiedersehen goodbye
i leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye
goodbye
im glad to go
i cannot tell a lie
i flit i float
i fleetly flee i fly
the sun
has gone to bed
and so must i
so long
farewell
auf wiedersehen
goodbye
goodbye
theyre extraordinary
what they would do at the festival
oh young lady i must have words with you
congratulations
georg youre not going to let this girl get away
she has to join the party
no really i
shh stop stop it
georg please
you can if you want to fraülein
i insist you will be my dinner partner
this is business
franz set another place next to mine
for fraülein maria
why whatever you say herr detweiler
it appears to be all arranged doesnt it
it certainly does
im not suitably dressed
uh well you can change well wait for you
all right
captain you must be very proud of your youngsters
i am thank you baroness
is there a more beautiful expression
of what is good in this country of ours
than the innocent voices of our children
oh come now baron would you have us believe
that austria alone holds a monopoly on virtue
herr zeller some of us prefer
austrian voices raised in song
to ugly german threats
the ostrich buries his head in the sand
and sometimes in the flag
perhaps those who would warn you
that the anschluss is coming
and it is coming captain
perhaps they would get further with you
by setting their words to music
if the nazis take over austria i have no doubt
that you will be the entire trumpet section
you flatter me captain
oh how clumsy of me
i meant to accuse you
its very kind of you to offer to help me baroness
im delighted maria
i really dont think i do have anything
that would be appropriate
now where is that lovely little thing
you were wearing the other evening
when the captain couldnt keep his eyes off you
couldnt keep his eyes off me
come my dear we are women
lets not pretend
we dont know when a man notices us
here we are
the captain notices everybody and everything
theres no need to feel so defensive maria
you are quite attractive you know
the captain would hardly be a man
if he didnt notice you
baroness i hope youre joking
not at all
but ive never done a thing to
but you dont have to my dear
theres nothing more irresistible to a man
than a woman whos in love with him
in love with him
of course
but what makes it so nice is
he thinks hes in love with you
but thats not true
surely youve noticed the way he looks into your eyes
and you know uh you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now
dont take it to heart
hell get over it soon enough i should think
men do you know
then i should go
i mustnt stay here
is there something i can do to help
no nothing
yes
please dont say a word about this to the captain
no no i wouldnt dream of it
goodbye maria
im sure youll make a very fine nun
champagne darling
i feel like celebrating
cheers
you know something
perhaps
then if youre so clever
tell me how to get our little fraülein
to use her influence with georg
i want those children in the festival
elsa this is important to austria
it wouldnt do you any harm either
ive thought of that
well if its a matter of influence
maybe the one youll have to be talking to is me

captain von trapp

when we would look at each other
oh mother i could hardly breathe

i was there on gods errand
to have asked for his love would have been wrong
i couldnt stay i just couldnt

maria the love of a man and a woman is holy too
you have a great capacity to love

my daughter if you love this man
it doesnt mean you love god less
no
you must find out
you must go back
mother you cant ask me to do that
please let me stay i beg of you
maria these walls were not built
to shut out problems
you have to face them
you have to live the life you were born to live
climb every mountain
search high and low
follow every byway
every path you know
climb every mountain
ford every stream
follow every rainbow
till you find your dream
a dream that will need
all the love you can give
every day of your life
for as long as you live
climb every mountain
ford every stream
follow every rainbow
till you find your dream
a dream that will need
all the love you can give

since youve obviously stuffed yourselves
full of thousands of delicious berries
you cant be hungry anymore

its all your fault we should have told him the truth
and made him boiling mad at us
kurt
its better than starving to death
louisa  we didnt do anything wrong
we just wanted to see her
my stomachs making noises
the least they could have done was to let us say hello
i wonder what grass tastes like
i feel awful
brigitta
when fraülein maria wanted to feel better
she used to sing that song remember
yes
lets try it
raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
brown paper packages tied up with strings
these are a few of my favorite things
why dont i feel better
girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
marias voice joins in
snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
silver white winters
kurt  fraülein maria shes back
that melt into springs
these are a few of my favorite things
when the dog bites
when the bee stings
friedrich  fraülein maria
when im feeling sad
i simply remember my favorite things
and then i dont feel
so bad
oh children im so glad to see you
we missed you

even to the children
well it was wrong of me forgive me
why did you
please dont ask me
anyway the reason no longer exists
baroness
fraülein maria
youve returned
isnt it wonderful georg
may i wish you every happiness baroness
and you too captain
the children tell me youre to be married
thank you my dear
you are back to uh stay
only until arrangements can be made
for another governess
baroness
there you are
i really must speak to cook about the wiener schnitzel
it is entirely too delicious for my figure
and it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table
hmm
or was it the wine
oh undoubtedly the wine
you have no idea what kind of trouble im having
trying to decide what to give you
for a wedding present
oh i know im enough but i do want you to have
some little trifle for the occasion
at first i thought of a fountain pen
but youve already got one
and then i thought perhaps
a villa in the south of france
but they are so difficult to giftwrap
georg how do you feel about yachts
a long sleek one for the mediterranean
or a tiny one for your bathtub hmm
elsa
and where to go on our honeymoon
now that is a real problem
i thought a trip around the world would be lovely
then i said oh elsa
there must be someplace better to go
dont worry darling i
elsa
yes georg
its no use
you and i
im being dishonest to both of us
and utterly unfair to you
when two people talk of marriage
no dont
dont say another word georg please
you see um
there are other things ive been thinking of
fond as i am of you
i really dont think youre the right man for me
youre um youre much too independent
and i i need someone who needs me desperately
or at least needs my money desperately
ive enjoyed every moment weve had together
i do thank you for that
now if youll forgive me
ill go inside pack my little bags
and return to vienna where i belong
and somewhere out there is a young lady who i think
will never be a nun
auf wiedersehen darling
von trapp
hello
i thought i just might find you here
was there something you wanted
hmm
no no no no sit down please
please
uh may i
chuckles
you know i was
i was thinking and i was wondering two things
why did you run away to the abbey
and
what was it that made you come back
well i had an obligation to fulfill
and i i came back to fulfill it
hmm is that all
and i missed the children
yes only the children
no yes isnt it right i should have missed them
oh yes yes of course
i was only hoping that perhaps you
perhaps you might uh
yes
well uh
nothing was the same when you were away
and itll be all wrong again after you leave
and i just thought perhaps
you might uh change your mind
im sure the baroness
will be able to make things fine for you
maria
there isnt going to be any baroness
there isnt
no
i dont understand
well weve um called off
our engagement you see and
oh im sorry
yes
you are
mmhmm
you did
yes
well you cant marry someone when youre
in love with someone else
can you
maria sighs
the reverend mother always says
when the lord closes a door
somewhere he opens a window
what else does the reverend mother say
that you have to look for your life
is that why you came back
and have you found it
maria
i think i have
i know i have
i love you
oh can this be happening to me
perhaps i had a wicked childhood
perhaps i had a miserable youth
but somewhere in my wicked miserable past
there must have been a moment of truth
for here you are
standing there
loving me
whether or not
you should
so somewhere in my youth
or childhood
i must have done something good
nothing comes from nothing
nothing ever could
so somewhere in my youth
or childhood
i must have done
something
good
do you know when i first started loving you
that night at the dinner table
when you sat on that ridiculous pine cone
laughing
what  laughs
i knew the first time you blew that silly whistle
oh my love
for here you are
standing there
loving me
whether or not
you should
so somewhere in my youth
or childhood
i must have done
something good
nothing comes from nothing
nothing ever could
so somewhere in my youth
chuckling
or childhood
i must have done
something
good
maria
hmm
is there anyone i should go to
to ask permission to marry you
well why dont we ask the children
the children

many a thing she ought to understand
but how do you make her stay

how do you keep a wave upon the sand

how do you hold a moonbeam in your hand

herr detweiler
heil hitler
oh good afternoon herr zeller
perhaps youve not heard im now the gauleiter
heil hitler
uh heil hitler
i have just come from the house
of captain von trapp
incidentally the only one in the neighborhood
not flying the flag of the third reich
since the anschluss
but we have dealt with that situation
i dont think
the housekeeper told me that i would find you here
it was the only information the woman would give me
what kind of information are you looking for
we want to know when the captain will be returning
well hes on his honeymoon trip
uh hes not been in touch with us
are you asking me to believe that the captain
has not communicated
with his children in over a month
herr zeller how many men do you know
who communicate with their children
while on their honeymoon
when he does return he will be expected to fill
his proper position in the new order
naturally naturally and may i
congratulate you that is your people
on deciding to allow the festival
to go on tonight as planned
why should it not go on
nothing in austria has changed
singing and music will show this to the world
austria is the same
ηeil hitler
ηeil hitler
sniffs
come on children lets go home
why was he so cross
everybodys cross these days darling
marta  maybe the flag with the black spider
on it makes people nervous
is father going to be in trouble
he doesnt have to be
the thing to do these days
is to get along with everybody
i want you all to remember that tonight at the concert
are we really going to sing
before a whole lot of people tonight
of course look the von trapp family singers
and here are your names liesl friedrich

everything about everyone
whos we

what is it
its a telegram from berlin
dont you want to come over tonight
and deliver it yourself
i am now occupied with more important matters
and your father better be too
if he knows whats good for him
but rolfe
father father
we didnt expect you so soon
hello hello hello
when did you get back
we didnt expect you home until next week
kurt

friedrich
why didnt you telephone us
we tried to but we couldnt get through
i had nothing to do with that georg
we came back as fast as we could
well well well well well we missed you
we missed kissing you good night
we missed all the noise you make
in the morning telling each other to be quiet
mostly we missed hearing you sing
oh you came back just in time
look fraülein maria i mean mother
were going to sing in the festival tonight
what
all chattering
yes weve been rehearsing all
surprise surprise
all right surprises for you on the terrace
marta
presents
well talk about this inside
i would have told you but you were away
i had to make a lastminute decision
i was fortunate to enter them at all
max
theyll be the talk of the festival
max
lmagine seven children in one family
max
somehow i recall having made it quite clear to you
how i feel about my family singing in public
but the committee heard them they were enchanted
what did they say
i have never heard such enthusiasm
oh darling dont you think just this once
absolutely out of the question
georg this is for austria
for austria there is no austria
but the anschluss happened peacefully
lets at least be grateful for that
grateful
you know max
sometimes i dont believe i know you
father i forgot this is for you
door opens closes
maria he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people
you must convince him
max i cant ask him to be less than he is
then ill talk to him
if the children dont sing at the festival
well it will be a reflection on austria
oh i know it wouldnt do me any good either
mother
hmm
that sounds so nice i like calling you mother
i like hearing it
you love father very much i can tell you do
very much
mother what do you do
when you think you love someone
i mean when you stop loving someone
or he stops loving you
well you cry a little
and then you wait for the sun to come out
it always does
there are so many things
i think i should know but i dont
i really dont
how can you
sometimes i feel the world is coming to an end
and then you feel its just beginning
yes
it was that way with me liesl
and for you it will be just as wonderful i promise
do you really think so
when youre sixteen going on seventeen
waiting for life to start
somebody kind who touches your mind
will suddenly touch your heart
when that happens
after it happens
nothing is quite the same
somehow i know ill jump up and go
if ever he calls my name
gone are your old ideas of life
the old ideas grow dim
lo and behold youre someones wife
and you belong to him
you may think this kind of adventure
never may come to you
darling sixteen going on seventeen
wait a year
or two
ill wait a year
just wait a year
or two
von trapp
liesl
what is it
berlin
theyve offered me a commission in their navy
ive been requested to accept immediately
and report to their naval base
at bremerhaven tomorrow
i knew something like this would happen
but i didnt think it would be so soon
to refuse them would be fatal for all of us
and joining them would be unthinkable
get the children all together
dont say anything thats going to make them worry
just get them ready
weve got to get out of austria
and this house
tonight
crickets chirping
max
it strains my back it breaks my heart
when i think of a certain singing group
that will not appear at the festival tonight
by the time youve made the announcement
well be over the border
i hope you appreciate the sacrifice im making
you have no choice
i know thats why im making it
marta
why doesnt father turn the motor on
because he doesnt want anyone to hear us
shh
louisa  what will frau schmidt and franz say
when they discover were gone
theyll be able to answer truthfully
they didnt know anything about it
if anyone asks them
will we be coming back here
someday liesl
i do hope someday
gretl  are father and uncle max
going to push the car
all the way to switzerland
shh
something wrong with your car captain
yes as a matter of fact we couldnt get it started
karl
fix captain von trapps car so that it will start
car engine starts
excellent karl
ive not asked you
where you and your family are going
nor have you asked me why im here
well apparently were both suffering
from a deplorable lack of curiosity
you were sent a telegram which you did not answer
a telegram from admiral von schreiber
of the navy of the third reich
i was under the impression herr zeller
that the contents of telegrams in austria are private
at least the austria i know
i have my orders
and they are to take you personally
to bremerhaven tonight
where you will accept your commission
im afraid thats going to be quite impossible
you see we uh
uh all of us the entire family
will be singing in the festival tonight
as a matter of fact thats where we were going now
couldnt possibly let them down now
i just hope were not too late
yes
and you ask me to believe that you
captain von trapp are singing in a concert
believe me it will be a performance
beyond anything even ive dreamt of
like you herr zeller
i too am a man of hidden talents
max
yes um here
the program
it says here only the names of the children
it says the von trapp family singers
and im the head of the von trapp family am i not
and these um travel clothes that youre all wearing
our costumes naturally
ηerr zeller this night air is not good
for the childrens voices
well a slight delay in my orders will not be serious
therefore you will sing
you will all sing but only because
thats the way i want it to be
it will demonstrate
that nothing in austria has changed
and when you are finished singing
you captain von trapp will be taken to bremerhaven
now if you will all get into your car
we will escort the von trapp family singers
to the festival
no escort will be necessary ηerr zeller
necessary a pleasure captain
after all we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds
would we
no
