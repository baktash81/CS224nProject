hey you look like you care about animals
yes i do
she really listens
when someone is talking
do you want to sign up here
you know what i
its funny i actually signed up for this
but i never heard from you guys
sometimes she listens too much
for too long
okay if you email me here
thank you so much have a good day
good luck
she is a good citizen
just call him
im not calling
she always knows the right thing to do
when it comes to difficult family shit
call him
i get stuck in my ways
and she knows when to push me
and when to leave me alone
she cuts all our hair
yeah
she is always inexplicably
brewing a cup of tea
that she doesnt drink
and its not easy for her
to put away a sock or close a cabinet
or do a dish but she tries for me
nicole grew up in la around actors
and directors and movies and tv
and is very close to her mother sandra
and cassie her sister
note the wrapping
nicole gives great presents
she is a mother who plays really plays
lizard
yeah
she never steps off playing
or says iris too much
mom
and it must be too much some of the time
chopped down a christmas tree
all right
nice two three four what
are you kidding me i was just in jail
goddamn it
do not laugh at me stop it
she is competitive
she is amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms
which ive always found very sexy
she keeps the fridge overfull
no one is ever hungry in our house
she can drive a stick
how could you
after that movie all over the girl
she could have stayed in la
and been a movie star
but she gave that up to do theater with me
in new york
you might as well get what you paid for
she is brave
she is a great dancer
infectious
she makes me wish i could dance
she always says when she doesnt know
something or hasnt read a book
or seen a film or a play
whereas i fake it or say something
like i havent seen it in a while
my crazy ideas are her favorite things
to figure out how to execute
lets try it
crawling
but also standing
she is my fa favorite actress
what i love about charlie
charlie is undaunted
he never lets other peoples opinions
or any setbacks
keep him from what he wants to do
and he liked me so
charlie eats like hes trying
to get it over with
and like there won 1 be enough food
for e everyone
a sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured
ls your sweater on backwards
but he is incredibly neat
and i rely on him to keep things in order
so
hes energyconscious
hey
sorry
he doesnt look in the mirror too often
i cried four times
me too
he cries easily in movies
i wonder if it was the same four
he is very selfsufficient
he can darn a sock
and cook himself dinner and iron a shirt
how are we doing over here
the peppers are cut
he rarely gets defeated which
i feel like i always do
cut some carrots
charlie takes
all of my moods steadily
he doesnt give in to them
or make me feel bad about them
hes a great dresser
he never looks embarrassing
which is hard for a man
goddamn it charlie get it together
hes very competitive
come on
whats this who owns baltic avenue
me
how much is it
i dont have enough
okay so im done
im done right thats it
this is so frustrating
this is so frustrating i always lose
dad
he loves being a dad
he loves all the things youre supposed
to hate like the tantrums
the waking up at night
i had a bad dream
its okay
its almost annoying
how much he likes it
but then its mostly nice
dad stay
he disappears into his own world
shit
whats shit
this is our stop
he and henry are alike in that way
he can tell people when they have food
in their teeth or on their face
in a way that doesnt make them feel bad
did you get it perfect
charlie is selfmade
his parents
i only met them once but
he told me there was a lot of alcohol
and some violence in his childhood
as soon as she comes with a lookout
theyre coming with a camcorder
camcorder
is that what theyre called
he moved to new york from indiana
with no safety net
and now hes more new yorker
than any new yorker
i made sure they used
the right almond milk
genius
he is brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around
with the theater company he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included
no one not even an intern
was unimportant
he could remember all the inside jokes
and where do you go when its windy
yeah that  that was funny
he is extremely organized and thorough
hes very clear about what he wants
unlike me who cant always tell
lets stop right there
who wants to start
iim not going to read this out loud
why is that
because i dont like what i wrote
as we mediate your separation
and eventual divorce
things can get quite contentious
so i like to begin
with a note of positivity
for the people i work with to remember
why they got married in the first place
and so that as you come apart
youre reminded that
this is a person
you had great feeling for
and maybe still do in many ways
ill read mine i like what i wrote
for it to really work
you both have to read
im not going to
okay um
i just think its a shame
that you guys arent going to get to hear
the wonderful things
you wrote about each other
she always says i cant write
but i think mines pretty good
nicole maybe youd change your mind
once you heard charlies
i dont want to hear charlies
we promised to listen
thats right
thats the very first step
in this process
well i think im going to go
if you two are going to just sit around
and suck each others dicks
how can this evil allow moderation
how can this evil allow moderation
how can it be right
to betray the departed
how is it human to be so
faithless
i want no praise from impious men
no home with them of quiet ease
noble blood still runs in my veins
shall i fail my father
stifling my cries
clipping the wings of grief
must his corpse in the ground
wretchedly waste away
feebly count for nothing
must his killers gloat
must his killers gloat
never to pay with blood for blood
charlie gave me the note
but its really for you
he told me to pick up my cues
how is that for me
acting is reacting
im responding to you
youre slowing me down
frank its closing night you know
you dont think charlie and nicole
will ever get back together
no i think this time its really over
it still feels weird
i feel like my parents are splitting up
its always been charlie and nicole
is charlie still giving notes
yep
youre lucky nic
i wish i was going to la
you can actually have space in la
theres no space here
ladies and gentlemen
i want to make a toast
to charlie
and to our beloved nicole
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure
all the way to sunny california
and we are also going to try
something new
we are going to take our play to broadway
it reminds me of when i was a young person
and went to broadway for the first time
and im telling you
winning your first tony at 27
it can mess with your head
i mean i was just a baby
elia kazan was backstage
im going to go over there now
dont do it mary ann
elbowing mike nichols
and mike was chatting with dietrich
and marlene you know
she usually was a barrel of monkeys
but tonight she was very very serious
could you give me a second
well id have to study it but
hey
hey i didnt expect you guys home
until late
hows he doing
good good he went to bed on time
no fuss
read him some of cricket in times square
god you guys are so attractive
shit sorry i didnt stop that
from being said
no its okay
ill pay for the whole time
we decided to come home early
hey thanks
and also the travel time
conversation
as well as anybody but ive gotta run
if you know what i mean
y youre leaving
well i aint moving in
we well be back when you get your
if you dont like that mediator
well find another one
yeah
wwe might not need a mediator
well just split everything anyway
i dont care
me neither
you can have most of it
well get apartments near each other
make it easier for henry
well figure it out
we want the same things
right
in the meantime
the pilot will be fun for you
you dont think its bad do you
i dont ever watch tv
so you know i cant tell
i told henry id come out to la
in two weeks to see him
yes
nothing
i can tell you want to give me a note
no i dont
yeah i mean yes i do but i guess
i guess it doesnt matter now
you wont be with the show anymore
its stupid
youre not going to be able to sleep
until you tell me
maybe not
okay then
so there are two things
i thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified
okay
and then
at the end i could tell
you were pushing for the emotion
well you know i cant cry on stage
and i know you dont like it
when i fake it but
i thought maybe tonight
it would come but
it didnt
thats all i had
thanks for indulging me
good night charlie
this is the day
this is the day that the lord has made
that the lord has made
let us rejoice
let us rejoice and be glad in it
and be glad in it
j this is the day
mom
gma summer is for relaxing
j this is the day
what do you want to do today
hang out and relax with you
me too
no relaxing
nicole has a hair and makeup test today
and henry we got you into fairy camp
with the cousins
i hate fairy camp
cassie says everyone likes fairy camp
and i think this is true
henry go make your mom some coffee
like i taught you
mom wait till you taste my coffee
oopadoodle
do you always sleep together
even in new york
no its just for right now
while we go through this transition
shit
dont tell charlie when he gets here
he hates cosleeping
well i have to say i agree with charlie
surprise surprise
its as if you have exploded
jesus its early
into this room
i can do this part alone
fine i wont look
as long as youre in my house
wake up is at 630 am
and until you know what you want to do
were going to do what i like to do
i cant just go from what charlie
wanted to do to what you want to do
even though i am 64
and have a dead gay husband
i manage to get up every day
live my life
and feel pretty good about myself
so maybe your mom knows a thing or two
you know what i would do
about what
when charlie gets here
id whisk him off to palm springs
thats what your father and i did
whenever we hit a speed bump
didnt you walk in on dad
blowing the porter in palm springs
and i always regretted
getting so upset about it
charlie and i are getting a divorce mom
theres nothing for us in palm springs
you need to wash your face
before you go to sleep
when daddy gets here
maybe we could all go on the jaws ride
yeah
or i could go once with daddy
and once with you
because i wouldnt mind
going twice anyway
no well all go together sweetheart
did you know that universal studios
is where i did my first screen test
on the plane i reread the pilot
as if i were charlie reading it
and i started to think it was just bad
my agent says its one to watch
this coffee is good thank you
youre welcome
what if charlie is on broadway
with a play i brought him
which i originated
and im just doing bad tv
everyone is only impressed
when they see someone on tv
shes beautiful
her wig looks great
wheres she been
the past ten years
doing weird theater in new york
downtown shit
i saw one it rained onstage
can i say something
it was good edgy
directed by her husband
supposedly very controlling
were lucky to have her
im surprised she said yes
we can thank her divorce
can she move her hand
its going to be hard to roto in the hair
on the baby around her fingers
can you move your hand
further down the baby
where like here
off the head entirely
i have to support his head
no no support the head of course
just try and do it from the shoulders
its perfect
yes good
i cant hold a baby like this
shes right thats going to look weird
we can totally do it
itll just take time and money
it was very important to me
to have this show based on hard science
so we can see your pretty face
and not ours
you shouldve seen me
before the plants invaded
i say that with respect
i was raised by two mothers
can you lower the board please pablo
here how about here
how about now
why is there always a flirty grip
i can do anything you want
i just need her here two hours
can i say something
dennis hold on what honey
she has to know
how to hold a baby
later on after she kills donny
she kills donny
thats a secret
we didnt give the crew those pages
she becomes a sort of a earth mother
to the plant community
thats not going to make any sense
if we feel like shes a bad mother
to her own kid
shes right
does donny know
must be nice to get out of new york
well im from out here
our daughter mia is at nyu
living in a shoebox
she says it went up to 104 the other day
we are just so excited to have you
im excited to be here
were going for an early aughts aesthetic
so having your presence just nails that
what signifies early aughts
into the girl was on tv
all over the girl
or streaming or something
you are fucking hot in that movie
carol
fuck it i speak my mind
were not allowing our son to see it
because you show your tits
carol
yeah
dennis
this is carter mitchum
hes a futurist at ucla
hes consulting on all the environmental
stuff for the show so its accurate
nice to meet you
is it
what
accurate
so far none of it
this pilot will go
so get ready to move back to la
listen everything you were saying
back there was absolutely right
if shes a bad mom we lose the audience
nobody knows were killing donny
including donny
i i thought
let us know if youd like to be part
of our writers room
i bet youd be really helpful actually
or i could direct
no yeah
sorry what maybe that sounds crazy
no do you have a reel
no because ive  ive never done it
i watched my husband do it for years
almost exhusband
whats the opposite of fiancé
dennis and i will talk
to your agent about it
at our theater i always wanted to direct
and then charlie would say something like
the next one
but he was always the director
so there never was a next one
i dont know maybe if wed
stayed married there wouldve been
yeah no were going
to kill him off it seems unlikely
im going to give you a number
okay is it a therapist
because i have a therapist
well its my moms therapist
we share her
shes a lawyer she represented me
when i left dennis
you and dennis are divorced
since 2013
you still work together
thats nice
no hes a fucking cocksucker
nora got me half of this project
in the settlement
well we talked about doing it
without lawyers
my sister had me meet
a bunch of them already
and i just hated them
call nora
she saved my life
sorry i
look so schleppy
i had an event at my kids school
let me get this out of the way
i think youre a wonderful actress
thank you
moved all over the girl
but the theater stuff too
you saw the theater stuff
i was in new york last year for my book
which remind me to give you a copy
and my publisher took me
great
thank you
you are awesome
well charlie directed it
i know
hes very talented
he is
theyre moving it to broadway
well without me of course
he was lucky to have you
how are you doing
sorry
honey
you take some breaths
and while you do
im going to tell you about myself
if you should choose to hire me
i will work tirelessly for you
and im always available by phone or text
except when im with my kids
i insist on doing drop off and pick up
every day at school
i understand
ive been through this myself
thank you annie so
i know how it feels
you do
yes
i have a kid from my ex
who is a narcissistic artist
and verbally abusive
im now with a great boyfriend
who lives in malibu
good
well charlies not terrible
no of course not
but they ravish you with attention
in the beginning
and then once we have babies
we become the mom
and they get sick of us
yeah
where do you want to live now doll
well
im here now obviously
i dont know
if the show will get picked up but
it feels like home
it is home
its the only home ive ever known
without charlie
you want to stay here
charlies not going to want that he
he hates la
were interested in what you want to do
sounds to me
like you did your time in new york
he can do some time here no
he always said we would but he never
did
how old is your son
henrys eight
yeah
he likes la
i dont know if its fair to him
i want you to listen to me
what youre doing is an act of hope
do you understand that
yeah
youre saying
i want something better for myself
i do
and this right now is the worst time
it will only get better
wasnt it tom petty who said
the waiting is the hardest part
i dont know
i represented his wife in their divorce
i got her half of that song
i dont want any money or anything
i just worry because we werent
going to use lawyers so
i dont want to be too aggressive
i want to stay friends
well do it as gently as possible
now
can you tell me a little more
about whats going on
because part of what were going to do
together is tell your story
its difficult to articulate
its
not as simple
as not being in love anymore
i understand
why dont you start at the beginning
wherever that is for you
well
i was engaged to ben
and living in la you know
and i felt like yes
i want to make movies and marry ben
jesus
i was only 19 or 20 at the time
i never felt older in my whole life
anyway if i was honest with myself
it was like a small part of me
felt dead
or deadish
you know you tell yourself
no ones perfect
no relationships perfect
this tea is delicious
isnt it its the manuka honey
anyway you were asking about charlie
so um
so yes so i was i was
happy with ben and aware of the deadness
and i went to new york
to meet with this director
for this space movie
but one where they take space seriously
like
sex trafficking in space
you know it was political
or at least they wanted us
to think it was
anyway it just
it was really fulfilling the same need
that certain fucked up porn does
um but anyway so
while i was there
the producer
invited me to see a play
it took place in someones apartment
with all the lights on
it was like nothing id ever seen before
this strange
surreal dystopian story
and it was so wellacted
and one of the actors
was this big shaggy bear
who played all his lines
looking directly at me
which i knew couldnt be the case
but it felt like it
and then later of course
i learned that it was
these cookies are really great too
ill send you home with some
afterwards i was introduced to the cast
and the bear turned out
to also be the director
he talked to me and
i talked back
the dead part wasnt dead
it was just in a coma
and
it was better than the sex the talking
although the
the sex was also like the talking
you know everything is like everything
in a relationship
dont you find that
and um
so we spent
the whole night
and the next day together and
i just never left
yes to be honest all the problems
were there in the beginning too
but i just went along with him
and his life
because it felt so damn good
to feel myself alive
in the beginning
i was the actress the star and
that felt like something you know
people came to see me at first but
the farther away i got from that and
the more acclaim the theater company got
i had less and less weight
i just became
who
well you know the actress
that was in that thing that time
and he was the draw
and that
wouldve been fine but
i got smaller
i realized i
i didnt ever really
come alive for myself
i was just feeding his aliveness
and
you know
he was so smart and creative it
it was fine
you know i would tell him things
at home in private
and they would work their way into public
conversation into his work and
for a while that felt like enough
i mean i was just so
so
so flattered
that someone like him would
would find an idea i had worth trying
or a comment i made worth repeating and
and then i got pregnant
and i thought that having a baby
could be ours could really be ours
but also really mine
and you know he was so excited
so it was nice
for a while
i mean kids they
they belong to themselves its like
the instant they leave your body
its just
the process of them going away
and i didnt belong to myself
and it was small stuff stupid stuff
and big stuff
all the furniture in our house
was his taste
i didnt even know
what my taste was anymore
because i had never been asked to use it
i didnt even pick our apartment
i just moved into his
and i made noises
about wanting to move back to la but
they came to nothing
and wed come here on holidays
because he liked my family
but if i suggested
we do a year or something
hed just put me off
it would be
strange if he turned to me and said
and what do you want to do today
you know i just watched that documentary
on george harrison
and i thought own it
just own it
be like george harrisons wife
being a wife and a mother thats enough
yeah then i realized
i couldnt remember her name so
this pilot came along
it shot in la and it paid so much
and it was like there was
this little lifeline thrown to me
heres this bit of earth thats yours
and
i was embarrassed about it
in front of him but it was also like
yeah this is who i am
and this is what im worth
and maybe its stupid
but at least its mine
and if he had just taken me
into a big hug and said
baby im so excited for your adventure
of course i want you to have
a piece of earth thats yours
then
well then
we might not be getting divorced
but
he made fun of it and
was jealous like he is and
then he realized about the money
and he told me i could funnel it
back into the theater company
and thats when i realized
he
truly didnt see me
he didnt see me as something
separate from himself
and i asked him to say my phone number
laughs
he didnt know it
so i left
also i think he slept
with the stage manager mary ann
that fucking asshole
seventyfive
just 70
those two zeros
seventyfive point zero zero
if railroad is unowned
thats zero cents
you may buy it from the bank
advance to illios
illinois
illinois avenue
advance what does that mean
it means youve got to go
to illinois avenue
so where is illinois avenue
that one
so cassie when charlie gets here
youre going to hand him the envelope
why do i have to do it
because nicole is very good
at getting people to do things for her
thats not what this is
i wiped her butt
until she was nine years old
shes very seductive that way
no mom legally
i cant be the one who serves him
but still what im saying is true
do i have to actually hand him
the envelope
yes but im going to tell him in advance
that theyre divorce papers
nora says it doesnt have to be so formal
wheres henry
hes playing in the living room
with sam and jules and molly

charlies going to be here soon
sam go upstairs
so ill tell charlie
whats happening
and cassie
you then hand him the envelope
okay
i just get nervous
well can you unserve
what do you mean like take it back
yeah
i think so
you should check
in case we change our minds
im not going to change my mind
or we feel too bad for him
maybe in case i do something wrong
now youre both
just making me feel bad okay
sorry sorry im nervous
well we all are
and we love charlie
you have to stop loving him mom
you cant be friends with him anymore
charlie and i have our own relationship
independent of your marriage
just like im still friends
with cassies ex jeff
are you still seeing jeff

i cant believe you
he still wants his camera back
by the way

of our marriage right now
i cant believe i even have to explain
this to you just be on my side okay

stuart rose from the ditch
climbed into his car
and started up the road
that led toward the north
the sun was just coming up
over the hills on his right
as he peered ahead into the great land
that stretched before him
the way seemed long
but the sky was bright
and he somehow felt
he was headed in the right direction
i forgot it ended that way
yeah wow stuart really overreacted
didnt you think
he was upset about his boat
dad you go away
mom you stay
hey daddy just got here
its okay
love you
you can come back and wake me up
and read to me later daddy okay
okay
will you come sleep in my bed later
yeah
on
hang in there charliebird
thanks gma
hes in a mommy phase right now
its okay
whoo
im sorry i drank too much wine
i can imagine
and didnt eat dinner
stressful time
i hope henry didnt notice
im sure he didnt
now that im a parent
i realize my parents
were probably drunk all the time with me
yeah
im sorry again
thanks
where are you staying
well i
hadnt
i guess ill
theres a new hotel on highland thats
supposedly not too expensive
and and pretty nice
okay ill check it out
again thats great
about the macarthur
thanks
charlie
yeah
thanks
fuck
what
shes being represented by nora
shes supposedly very fair
all right heres the fact jack
i charge 950 an hour
ted is 400
if you have a stupid question
you call ted
to start well need a 25000 retainer
thats more than i can
and all your financials
we need to do a forensic accounting
which runs anywhere
from ten to twenty thousand dollars
but if we can all agree right away
it shouldnt get too bad right
you were married here in la
yes because her mom and sister
are out here
and im not close with my family
your son was born out here
yes because again her mom
and sister are out here and im not
so you got married here
your kid was born here
and she served you here
yeah but we lived in new york
why
is there a problem
well have to reshape the narrative
if youre serious
about having your child in new york
this is what i suggest
you take your kid
ddid you say his name was fred
henry
henry
why did i say fred
i have a kid named fred
you take henry to new york
with you right now
then we file an action in new york
we make this a new york case
we need to make an argument
youre a new yorkbased family
well we are
otherwise youll probably never
see your kid outside of la again
really no
its very hard
to convince the courts to move a kid
as soon as you let your wife and child
leave new york
you made life very difficult for yourself
yes but as i said
were a new york family
thats just a fact
shes here temporarily
then why do you think
she served you out here
i dont know
but henry wants to go back to new york
dont quote your kid
hes just telling you
what you want to hear
and trust me
hes telling her the opposite
let me have the barber file
its right here
move my lunch to 130
whats
exit goat
exit ghost its the name
of my theater company
youre a director
theater director yeah
anything ive seen
i dont know what have you seen
our production of electra
is moving to broadway
which is exciting
we have to make sure
that money is protected
i mean its theater
so its not a lot of money
i basically put whatever money i make
back in the theater
i wonder do we ask for support
interesting
from nicole
im not going to do that
does your wifes family have money
her mother has some
from her tv career
and her father died
well we could say that we dont want
her mother to see the kid
draw her into the case
in that instance
her mother could pay your legal fees
no
im very close to her mom
nicoles family has been my family
yeah but thats going to change
and i suggest you get used to it
we need to hire a private investigator
really i mean
really
does your wife do drugs or anything
coke
not in any real way
well were not going to win
if shes the perfect mother
she was addicted to tums for a while
it wasnt nothing
she was up to a tube a day
have you noticed anyone following you
no
well keep an eye out
look you need to be prepared for the fact
that nora is going to portray you
as a neglectful absent father
but im not
you live in new york
youre consumed with your work
she and your kid are out here struggling
noras going to use that strategy
im sure of it
but nicoles not going to lie
listen if we start from a place
of reasonable
and they start from a place of crazy
when we settle well be somewhere
between reasonable and crazy
which is still crazy
half of crazy is crazy
you know what people say criminal
lawyers see bad people at their best
divorce lawyers see good people
at their worst
before this is all over
youre going to hate me and ted
just because of what we represent
in your life
im sure youre right
so tell me the story again
you came out here to see your kid
maybe im not explaining this well
she serves you
were friendly were fine
what a bitch
were just trying to figure this out
shes not a bitch
thanks but this isnt
were doing it a different way
and i cant even close to afford this
ive got to get back to new york
i have a broadway play in rehearsals
i was the hot shit at that time
young very sexy
with a great head of hair
i just so appreciate that charlie
gave me this opportunity
or maybe i should thank nicole
i heard nicoles pilot went to series
so shes moving to la
and they put henry in school out there
well is charlie moving too
not charlie
he wont abandon us
and you cant do theater in la
charlie said she and henry
are coming back to new york
when she finishes filming her show
i wouldnt be so sure
nicole was never going to stay
in new york that was obvious
she was probably
planning this move all along
when she sees an opportunity
believe me she takes it
well la is nice
the space
miss four time oscar winner sucking my
okay how is everyone today
nobody get too close
i think i caught donnas cold
sorry charlie
im expecting a skype call from henry
so i might have to step out
so charlie what youre going through now
is going to be horrible
but it will be over
thanks frank
another thing
yeah
fuck as many people as you can right now
women men
take what i said seriously
you might need help wrapping gauze
it needs to stay tight
okay im  im confused
what scene
is the invisible man outfit for
no thats my halloween costume
and the frankenstein
is for henry
hes coming here this weekend
were going to trick or treat
in the slope
i made it more james whale
than kenneth branagh

ive typed up the blocking
from the last two rehearsals

from that danish production from the 70s

since you were served
by law youre meant to respond
within 30 days
i didnt like the first lawyer i met
it says that very clearly
on the document you were given
did you read it
yeah but i thought
thats just what it says

charlie i think i shouldnt
tuck in my shirt
nicole said i could take my time
and weve let you take your time
keeps coming out during the love scene
could you hold a second what love scene
when i hug beth
you dont hug beth
i think its something we should explore
cant you just tuck it in tighter
or get donna to safety pin it
i also have a kind of a thing
about tucking things in
charlie
if you dont file your response
we re going to file a request
for default judgment against you
insecurities about my figure
charlie
yes sorry
default judgment what does that mean
dont hug beth
we ll be able to lay claim
to whatever we want
wwhat do you mean
whatever you want of what
your apartment your things
everything you own
we
she and i already discussed this
we dont own that much stuff
she can have
pretty much whatever she wants
and it means we ll set the number
for child support at its highest level
and claim full custody of your child
full custody
i mean thats not even
this is what the law says
nicoles not going to do that
i mean she wont
no charlie l represent nicole
and shes aware of everything
im saying to you
i just spoke to her this morning
well i spoke to her five minutes
before i go on the call

henry can you wait a minute
no talking alone
just one bit of talking alone
then ill be right there
i got a call from your lawyer
she said youd take everything and
custody and everything
if i didnt respond
its better if we just

yeah but shes saying things
i dont think you mean
henry we need to get going
i dont want to go now
have you gotten a lawyer yet
thats what im here to do

i have a booster
wait no its not in
whats not in
the seats not connected
i asked the rental company to install it

for liability reasons
do you know how these things
let me just if you
there should be a clip to clip onto
dig
effort grunts
fuck
why fuck
something sharp
cant i stay with mom
no
why not
its my time with you
i just flew 3000 miles
i dont want to
henry get in the fucking car
im sorry but jesus
get in the fucking car
how do you spell lego bionicles
thats two words
what does lego start with
just tell me
dont you want to learn it
no
its on the box anyway
l
then what
e you know
everyone at the theater says hi
hi
then what
a  sound
are you excited for halloween
j
g
then what
and an o sound
o
are you excited for halloween
yeah
i brought both our costumes
im going as a storebought ninja
but we agreed
i had donna make you a frankenstein
i dont want to be a frankenstein anymore
are you sure
maybe just look at it
its awesome well be frankenstein
and the invisible man
mom bought me a ninja costume
which is better because it costs more
technically the frankenstein cost more
when you factor in donnas time
and the materials
the cousins are also going to be ninjas
but henry
we went through all this trouble
okay
whatever you want
please take the ticket
dad youre too far
i know
please take the ticket
so im not comfortable
leaving the bags in the car
where ive given the key to someone
i dont really know
ive been here
its an office building
so youve been to places like this before
i remember those fish
a lot of fish look the same
can i help you
im charlie barber
i have a 130 with dan cohen
hi wheres your little man
i dont have it this time
i keep my skeletons at my moms
okay
okay
im sorry we tried to reach you
mr cohen wanted me to apologize
he cant see you because apparently
your wife already met with him
on the 7th of august about representation
bbut she hired somebody else
nora
fanshaw
but unfortunately because she consulted
with mr cohen already
hes legally barred from representing you
should we feed the fish
yeah
it happens all the time
really
if you have a ticket
i can validate your parking
you know its common that people
meet with as many lawyers as possible
so that their spouse has limited options
i dont think
she wouldve done it deliberately
youd be surprised
can all of them like
breathe out of the water
did you go to a lot of offices
with your mom
not so many
like 11
i dont think anyone
would have stealed the bags daddy
i need somebody today
if i dont respond by tomorrow
she said i could lose custody
i didnt know who else to call
theres got to be someone she didnt meet
i have a name for you
bert spitz
he was the entertainment lawyer
at robertas agency
great
but then he kind of got pushed
into retirement a few years ago
and he went into family law
i called him
thank you gma
he can see you today at three
aw shit
we never had this conversation
charliebird
you got it i love you
aw
dad
i need a new burger
why
because you made us carry your bags
into the restaurant i dropped it
thats fine ill give you mine
get in the car
why did you bring me today
if you couldnt hang out with me
because ive been away
and want to see you
jamie tuber has a little sister
named um lily tuber
yeah
and lily tuber is really bossy
getting divorced with a kid can be
one of the hardest things youll ever do
its like a death without a body
i know personally
ive been there four different times
youve been divorced four times
married four times
three divorces
this last one will stick god willing
thats why i graduated into family law
to help people survive this painful time
heres how i see it
if we get bogged down
in who did this and who did that
and i dont want to pay the two dollars
itll just cost you more money
and time and
emotional stress
and youll probably end up
with the same result anyway
right
i mean i agree with that philosophy
she does too im sure
and i always go with the truth
no matter where that takes us
you know most people in my business
make up the truth
so they can get where they need to go
youre just transactions to them
li like to think of you as people
okay good
and not just you her too
yes
you know this can be
a really ugly process
but i also believe
it doesnt have to be terrible
im glad to hear you say that
um
id love to keep expenses down
as much as possible
of course you do
i charge 450 an hour
and i need a 10000 retainer to start
ill see if i can get an advance
on the broadway transfer
and keep in mind
youll have to pay for her lawyer
i didnt
what
well at least part of her
it doesnt make sense does it
i mean youre doing this
because you love your kid
and in doing so youre draining money
from your kids education
it seems ridiculous
it is
it is boy
well have to respond right away
your son goes to school out here
yeah temporarily we agreed
her pilot went to series
and i wanted to accommodate her
as shes often felt
we do things on my terms
be a better husband in divorce
i guess something like that
but we live in new york
well with your kid
going to school out here
the court may see it differently
will we go to court
no no we dont want to go to court
the courts in california are a disaster
no thats just how
we have to think about it
im not sure these are my glasses
where are you living while youre here
im in a hotel right now
no a hotel doesnt look good
to who
the court
you just said
we werent going to go to court
no of course of course
we have to prepare to go to court
hoping we dont go to court
okay
you should get a place in la
and get a place near her
it looks better for custody reasons
shes in west hollywood
thatll be expensive
li guess i could rent
our new york apartment
dont rent it
you have to continue to prove
new york residence
and of course if you have a place in la
its hard to show you all live
in new york isnt it
so
what do i do
i recommend you spend
as much time as you can with your son
many people fight for that time
then they dont even use it
they just want to win
this shouldnt be
that complicated right
i mean were a new york family
i think its all pretty straightforward
right
i hope so yes
i see no reason
you both love your child
you respect each other
why this shouldnt be
relatively painfree
right
i think you have my glasses
that makes sense
what have you been doing
reading this magazine
you were reading california lawyer
yeah
okay im almost done
i wouldnt expect too much from that cat
what kind of pet do you want
i dont know
i want you to know
that eventually this will all be over
and whatever we win or lose
itll be the two of you
having to figure this out together
thank you
youre the first person in this process
whos spoken to me like a human
you remind me of myself
on my second marriage
come come come come
you have fun with daddy
we drove around to offices
do you want to see your ninja costume
its on gmas bed
yeah
yeah
you know i had donna build him
this whole frankenstein thing
with the plugs and
yeah well the cousins are ninjas
so he wanted to do that
but he and i had decided together
well i cant make him
be frankenstein
im not asking you to
but maybe you can help me out a little
ill leave the frankenstein here maybe
you can nudge him in that direction
ill try
whats the
did you dye your hair again
is that for your show
no this is me it was this way
when i saw you before
i know but i didnt say anything then
you dont like it
no i guess its fine
is it shorter i prefer longer but
sorry its just absurd
is everything okay
yeah why
you seem i dont know
like something is
everythings fine
okay im going to check in at the hotel
but i should be able to get to you guys
by 500 530
were going to cassies in pasadena
and trickortreating with the cousins
cassie lives in pasadena now
yes she and sam moved there
a couple months ago
okay i dont really know pasadena
ill figure it out whats the address
my mom is looking forward to it
ill text sam
and cassie and sam are mad
mad at who
you
cassie and sam
you can understand that
so i think we should probably do
separate halloweens
but if youre okay with it
then shouldnt they be okay with it
lets do it this way this time
do you not want me there
im fine with it
okay
itll be nice for him
hell have two halloweens
what am i going to do with him for second
halloween walk around sunset boulevard
maybe the hotel has something or you can
drive to a different neighborhood
the sun sets forever
there shall never be another dawn
no
lady
i require the solace of the shadows
and the dark
okay ready for halloween
hi
wow elaborate
sweetheart dont forget to wear
your jacket its getting colder
this is a nice house
ready to go back out
he has to pee
no i dont
he does
some of his men are in here
and also bearbear

david bowie right station to station

henry have a great halloween
with daddy okay
have fun
go pee and then were going back out
im too tired

this block looks promising
i wish halloween was over
well it isnt
if we were in new york
we could be walking
but i like that were sitting right now
i like to sit
thats true los angeles

i think thats why
i like los angeles better
because you get to sit
and because i like my friends here better

no matter where we are
but we both want to be with you
but youre not near me
if youre in new york
well we all still live in new york
yeah but i go to school here

my lawyers wouldnt let me sign anything
its our divorce
they say i could later sue them
for malpractice
what am i walking into
what are you walking into
yes what the fuck is going on
i read your fucking emails charlie
i read them all
when
i dont know recently
shit
youre a fucking liar
you fucked mary ann
it was after i was sleeping on the couch
all this bullshit about working on us
you know what i have been working
ive been doing the work alone
how did you read my emails
i hacked into your account you dumb fuck
i think thats illegal
dont give me this shit
about being surprised about la
surprise i have my own opinions
how do you even know
how to do something like that
surprise i want things
that arent what you want
because surprise
you were fucking another lady
it was one time i think youre conflating
two different things
mary ann has nothing to do with la
i am conflating motherfucker
you watch me conflate
did you just stamp your foot
i dont think ive ever done that before
im just so angry
you look like you needed one
yes i do thanks
you know the japanese are making
really interesting tequila right now
thats exciting i guess
what are you so angry about
my fucking exhusband
i spent all this time feeling guilty
and hes so selfabsorbed
its pointless
its a game im playing with myself
hey pablo we met at
you held the bounce board
the flirty grip
heres what i want you to only do okay
what
i want you to finger me
what
just finger me
okay
thats all were going to do
just fingering okay
im changing my whole fucking life
nicole and charlies son henry
was born here in los angeles
he currently attends laurel elementary
in laurel canyon
and nicole works in hollywood
while also maintaining a full schedule
as a mother
with classes of swim art
gym and music as well as play groups
nicole is henrys
primary custodial parent
and to the extent that charlie
would like to exercise his custodial time
he should be making efforts
to visit henry here in california
nora you seem to be ignoring the fact
that they lived in new york for ten years
my client worked in new york
for several years thats true
but nicole was born and bred
right here in la
she and charlie would come here
most holidays and summers
to spend time with her family
who all live in la
she and charlie were married in la
would you like to see the photos
no i dont need to see the photos
although im sure
they both look beautiful
its my clients expectation
that after this tv show is completed
the parties will move back to new york
where they currently keep an apartment
and its my understanding
that charlie promised nicole
that they would spend more time
in los angeles during the marriage
but because of his insistence
that his work keep them in new york
nicole ended up staying there much longer
than she ever anticipated
in fact a few years ago
charlie was offered a residency
at the geffen playhouse
that would have taken his work
and his family
to los angeles for a year
and he um
turned it down
even though that was nicoles desire
he wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child
was this the same consistency
he wanted to maintain
when they went to copenhagen
for six months so he could direct a play
now while i understand
charlie lives in new york
and when its convenient to his work
schedule he flies out to see his son
he flies out here every chance he gets
at great expense
i dont see any reason
you cant be out here full time
he makes his living in new york
sorry do we want to contemplate lunch
good idea
ill order now so itll come
when were all hungry
yeah
everyone good with mannys
id love mannys
have you had mannys
youll love it
just really yummy sandwiches and salads
ill have the blt
dad
turkey
ill have the blt
youll have the kale
kale salad
i dont know sorry
charlie will have um
the greek salad
but with lemon and olive oil
instead of the greek dressing
okay
ill have the chinese chicken salad
okay sure
thank you
yeah
congratulations charlie on your grant
nicole told me
thank you
hes a genius
well i told nicole
i loved your play
really
thanks
you are one smart cookie
thanks
i would just love to
crawl inside that brain
there was that one moment
when you smell the toast smell
it was literally my favorite thing
that i saw that year
thanks
truly genius
thank you
i was sorry to hear it closed on broadway
they couldnt smell the toast
it was so emotional
laughs
its very competitive i imagine
now when charlie is in los angeles
nicole of course agrees
that it will be best for henry
that he see each parent equally
its very nice out here charlie
you should give it a chance
yeah and the space you cant beat it
i love it too
but all of our personal feelings
about the two cities aside
we dont share your assertion
that the couple is an labased family
it was very clearly their deal
that they would go back to new york
after nicole finished her show
im not aware of any deal
well i didnt get it in writing
charlie is this like the deal
that you made
that you and nicole would spend more time
in la during your marriage
we didnt have a deal
it was something we discussed
but
so its a deal
when its something you want
and a discussion when nicole wants it
sidebar
nora do you have a spare office
where charlie and i can sidebar
sure
can you um
i can show you
come on
nora is a very good lawyer
tough right
yeah
and youre in a bind because youve shown
youre willing to fly out here
and rent an apartment to see your son
you told me to do that
i know that
and im doing that because i want
to see my kid not to set a precedent
yes but unfortunately
you are setting a precedent
and a judge might look at it that way
whats the alternative i stay in new york
and never come out here
no because then it would look
to the court
like you dont care about seeing your son
court or no court stop saying court
and then never court
well the way this is going
we may have to go to court
are you aware of how maddening you sound
i am
and i know it seems unfair
but imagine if you were
a poor mother whose husband abandons her
and then refuses to pay anything
thats what the system
is trying to protect people from
listen
if i were representing you
you are representing me
right no of course no
i dont see a judge
moving this child from california
i think we try and settle today
settle meaning what
she gets la
no bert just
no
i mean we have to win this
remember the win
is whats best for henry
and if you guys go to court
hes going to get pulled into it
but if he stays here
and i stay in new york thats just
then i wont
ill never get to really be
his parent again
itll be different
it wont exist
so maybe you move here
you heard what amir said about the space
fuck the space bert fuck the space
ill do whatever you want me to do
but this is my advice
ive seen these things go on and on
and the burden of these battles
is immeasurable
i had a client get colon cancer and die
before he and his wife came to agreement
what about filing in new york
its too late
and even if you did
i dont think it would matter
theyre being reasonable financially
you know
youre  youre lucky they didnt ask
for half your grant money
she wouldnt do that she knows
i put all that money back in my theater
if this continues she might
the actors and crew
all rely on that money
the court would never agree
with this right
whether they do or not
itll cost you half your grant money
to go to court and prove it
i feel like a criminal
but you didnt commit any crime
it doesnt feel that way
if we give on la right now
and then try to make
the best deal possible
i think we can get her
to give on other fronts
there are no other fronts
this is the thing
he needs to know that i fought for him
hell know
i should never have
let her come out here with henry
if it wasnt la and new york
itd be something else
youd be fighting about a house
or a school district or
you know what this is like
this is like that joke about the woman
at the hairdresser shes going to rome
do you know this
i dont
this woman is at her hairdresser
and she says
im going to rome on holiday
and he says really
what what airline are you taking
she says alitalia

she says im going to stay
at the hassler

theyre renovating the hassler
youll hear hammering all night long
you wont sleep
what are you going to see
she says i think im going to try
to go to the vatican
the vatican
youll be standing in line all day long
youll never get to see anything
im sorry bert

whatever happens here its temporary
hes growing up hes going to have
opinions on the subject
time is on your side charlie
maybe hell do college on the east coast
i have most of my coins
like my quarters and dimes at daddys

bert and i hammered out
90 percent of the details
and theres a couple minor things hanging
but it should be easy
and then the judge
makes your divorce official
thats good
fuck me
what
whos that
charlie shouldnt have done this
what do you mean wheres bert
this means that everything
weve agreed upon now is off the table
weve got la right
not with jay marotta representing him
this is a street fight now
and im going to have to ask for things
that we wouldnt normally ask for
this system rewards bad behavior
jay
hey
hi
i saw miriam at madeo the other night
yeah
looking very handsome
you know you should come
to our stand up to cancer event
john legends going to play
love him
okay its going to be
at the beverly hilton i think
great
okay
she said youre spending
more time in malibu
really
me too
i havent seen her
since that building was icm
a little history
ten years ago charlie takes a risk
when he first hires nicole as an actress
in his play in new york city
hes a wellregarded
upandcoming director
of the avantgarde
and shes known
as the girl in that college sex movie
who takes her top off
my client will not be slutshamed
ten years on
for an artistic choice
and many prestigious
theater roles later
she becomes an actress
of great credibility
and its because of that credibility
that shes offered the lead role
in a major television show
this new opportunity is thanks to charlie
your honor we shouldnt have to pay
support money at this point
in fact charlie is entitled
to half her tv money
present and future earnings of the show
charlies just received
the enormous sum of 650000
in the form of a macarthur grant
of which he gets
this is for the theater work
he conducted during the marriage
in 125000 installments
over five years
so by jays same logic this is work
he uses the money
that nicole contributed to
to employ actors and crew members
one at a time please
and to pay debts that hes accumulated
with his theater company
that stars his wife
bless you
not only did she turn down
a lucrative and successful career
in movies
to perform in his little theater
but she actually supplied charlie
with a loan early on to help out
which he paid back
she lent her name to the marquee
which was the principle reason
people came to the theater
that may have been true ten years ago
and in turn
she helped establish charlies reputation
now over the next ten years
she was subsequently offered parts
in movies tv shows
most of which she turned down
at charlies behest
to be a mom and act in his plays
so while we are willing to be flexible
on support
we contend that half of charlies
grant money be split between the parties
i dont see how you can claim
that she gets half a grant
dedicated to his genius
he became a genius during the marriage
come on nora
charlie himself upon hearing
that he received the prize
told nicole that it belonged to her too
thats what people say
when they win awards
no he was implying what was true
his genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage
nora i like how you refer
to charlies theater
as a ramshackle downtown dump
when youre arguing custody
but when you want more money
hes a big rich genius
broadway director
you cant have it both ways
really why not
and whether you think
its fair or not jay
the first monetary installment
from the macarthur grant
was put into a joint marital account
and thus became communal property
fuck you shouldnt have put
that money in a joint account
theres not going to be anything left
anyway im using it all to divorce her
nora i have to say
that your account of this marriage
takes place in an alternate reality
by suddenly moving to la
and insisting on an la residence
nicole is withholding henry
counsel please be seated
alienating him from his father
which has turned charlies world
upside down
counselor
it amounts to an ambush
withholding jay really alienating
well those are fighting words
and its simply false and does nothing
to further this settlement
your recap of this situation
is outrageous
and although california is
without doubt a nofault state
it bears mentioning
in the accurate recap of this situation
that charlie had had extramarital affairs
an extramarital affair
do you really want me to go there
yeah lets go there
okay
nicole has admitted
to hacking charlies computer
and reading his emails
which if proven is a felony
and nora
i dont think youd be too happy
if i ask nicole about her alcohol
consumption in the evenings
what
she confided in charlie
one night recently
having just carried henry to bed
that she was having trouble standing
while walking down the staircase
and from what i understand
this is not an isolated event
so you let me know nora
and we will go there as needed
charlie
can i ask you
how do you expect
to have more time with henry
when you dont exercise the time
you already have
and exercise it responsibly
on a recent visit to los angeles
after failing to call text
communicate in any way shape or form
charlie finally arrived two hours late
to pick up henry
at nicoles mothers house
at that point the car seat
which he had assured nicole
had been professionally installed
was clearly not even belted in
it was just sitting in the back seat
you have to buckle in the car seat
its the law
i know
i thought the rental place did it
they cant its a liability
i know that now
once we discovered that we fixed it
counsel
you can see my courtroom is full
and there are people who dont have
the resources your clients have
and im fairly certain
you havent exhausted in good faith
the arguments in the case of this child
in the meantime
well keep the status quo
this remains an la family
for the time being
i took over this department recently
and im still becoming acquainted
with the cases
so im going to appoint
an expert evaluator
who knows much more about young children
than i do
once the evaluation is done
well modify the orders where necessary
hey
hey wheres henry
hes with cassie and her kids
at laser tag
you want something to drink
i have unfiltered tap water beer
and some juice boxes
ill take a juice box
you dont have anything on the walls
i dont have anything to put on them
except henrys art which is being framed
i can give you some stuff
you know until you get some things
how about that great picture of henry
on the staten island ferry
arent you in that one
i guess i you could cut me out
im gonna have to leave a day early
to go to new york on the 22nd
so i was wondering
if i could take henry that friday
the 22nd so thats the 21st
we have plans actually
were going to um some thing at lacma
with the cousins
but could you change it
so i could take him
its just one night
hes looking forward to it
really
its my night charlie we negotiated it
okay fine
but what
no im just asking you to be flexible
i am flexible you come in and out
and i adjust based on your schedule
this one night we have tickets to
its not only this one night but fine
henrys teacher wants to meet with us
you mean his la teacher
can you answer the email
so we could set a time
yeah ive been distracted
i understand
they just want to rule out everything
you know with his reading
i just think hes a little overanxious
i think he wants it too much
they said hes off the charts in math
he quits too easily
when things arent easy for him
you know hes like us hes stubborn
hes still a lousy monopoly player
because he tries to save all his money
laughs
laughs
so
i thought we should talk
i feel like maybe things
have gone too far
i mean my moms taking out a loan
against the house to help me pay nora
i thought i paid nora
you pay 30 percent of nora
well im going broke too
if thats any help
ive just agreed to direct
two shitty plays
and we can forget putting anything away
for henrys college
its just that up until now weve been
able to keep henry somewhat removed
and this will change that
we have to protect him
i agree
nora says that the evaluator
will come into our homes
theyre going to interview henry
in addition to us
our friends family enemies
and then theyll observe us with him
how we are as parents
sounds awful
i know
i feel like if anybody observed me on any
given day as a mom id never get custody
that was a joke
i know i feel the same way
right
so
maybe we can figure
something out between us
you remember i said this to you
at the beginning
i know you did
but these are different circumstances
i was anticipating these circumstances
anyway shall we try this
okay
i dont know how to start
do you understand
why i want to stay in la
no
well thats not
charlie thats not a useful way
for us to start
i dont understand it
you dont remember promising
that we could do time here
we discussed things
we were married we said things
we talked about moving to europe
about getting a
sideboard or what do you call it
a credenza to fill the empty space
behind the couch
we never did any of it
you turned down the residency
at the geffen
that wouldve brought us here
for a  a year
it wasnt something i wanted
we had a great theater company
and a great life where we were
you call that a great life
you know what i mean
i dont mean we had a great marriage
i mean life in brooklyn
professionally
i dont know honestly
i never considered anything different
well thats the problem isnt it
i mean i was your wife
you shouldve considered my happiness too
come on you were happy
youve just decided you werent now
okay okay
lets
mmy work is here now my family is here
and i agreed to put henry in school here
because your show went to series
i did that knowing that when you were done
shooting hed come back to new york
honey we never said that
that may have been your assumption
but we never expressly said that
we did say it
when did we say it
i dont know when we said it
but we said it
i thought
we said it that time on the phone
honey let me finish sorry
i keep saying that
i thought that if henry was happy here
and my show continued
that we might do la for a while
i was not privy to that thought process
the only reason we didnt live here
is because you cant imagine desires
other than your own
unless theyre forced on you
okay you wish you hadnt married me
you wish you had a different life
but this is what happened
so what do we do
i dont know
nora says
theres no coming back from this
fuck nora i hate fucking nora
telling me i always lived in la
even though i never lived in la
how could you have her
say those things about me
jay said them about me too
you shouldnt have fired bert
i needed my own asshole
lets just both agree both of our lawyers
said shitty stuff about both of us
nora was worse
jay called me an alcoholic
you pulled the rug out from under me
and youre putting me through hell
you put me through hell
during our marriage
is that what that was hell
and now youre going to put henry
through this horrible thing
so you can yet again get what you want
its not what i want
i mean its what i want
but its what was
was
whats best for him
well i was wondering when youd
get around to henry and what he wants
fuck off
no you fuck off
if youd listen to your son or anyone
then hed tell you
that hed rather live here
stop putting your feelings about me
onto henry
he tells me he likes it better here
he tells you because he knows
its what you want to hear
he tells me youre on the phone all
the time you dont play with him
because im going through a divorce in la
and trying to direct a play in new york
which closed because i wasnt there
it was a huge opportunity for me
youre fighting for something
you dont even want
and i let everyone down
youre being so much like your father
do not compare me to my father
i didnt compare you to him
i said you were acting like him
youre exactly like your mother
everything you were complaining about her
youre doing youre suffocating henry
first of all i love my mother
she was a wonderful mother
im just repeating what you told me
secondly how dare you
compare my mothering to my mother
i may be like my father
but i am not like my mother
you are
and youre like my father
youre also like my mother
youre all the bad things
about all of these people
but mostly your mother
when we would lie in bed together
sometimes i would look at you and see her
and just feel so gross
i felt repulsed when you touched me
youre a slob
i made all the beds
closed all the cabinets
the thought of having sex with you
makes me want to peel my skin off
youll never be happy in la or anywhere
youll think you found
some better opposite guy than me
and in a few years
youll rebel against him
because you need to have your voice
but you dont want a voice
you just want to fucking complain
about not having a voice
i think about being married to you
and that woman is a stranger to me
i mean we had a childs marriage
youve regressed
youve gone back to your life
before you met me its pathetic
people used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist
and i used to defend you
they were absolutely right
all your best acting is behind you
youre back to being a hack
you gaslighted me
youre a fucking villain
you want to present yourself as a victim
because its a good legal strategy
fine but you and i both know
you chose this life
you wanted it until you didnt
you used me so you could get out of la
i didnt use you
you did and then you blamed me for it
you always made me aware
of what i was doing wrong
how i was falling short
life with you was joyless
what so then you had to go
and fuck someone else
you shouldnt be upset that i fucked her
you should be upset
that i had a laugh with her
do you love her
no
but she didnt hate me you hated me
you hated me
you fucked somebody we worked with
you stopped having sex with me
in the last year
i never cheated on you
that was cheating on me
but there was so much i could have done
i was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking time out new york
i was hot shit and i wanted
to fuck everybody and i didnt
and i loved you
and i didnt want to lose you
but im in my twenties
and i didnt want to lose that too
and i kinda did
and you wanted so much so fast
i didnt even want to get married
and fuck it
theres so much i didnt do
thanks for that
youre welcome
i cant believe
i have to know you forever
youre fucking insane
and youre fucking winning
are you kidding me
i wanted to be married
id already lost
you didnt love me as much as i loved you
what does that have to do with la
what
youre so merged
with your own selfishness
you dont even identify it
as selfishness anymore
youre such a dick
every day i wake up
and i hope youre dead
dead like if i could guarantee
henry would be okay
id hope youd get an illness
and then get hit by a car and die
god
im sorry
me too
okay no we can make this nice
um i would take the smaller plants
and put them by the window
and do you have things
we can put on the walls
all right thats it
thank you very much
we miss you
and it looks great really
let us know how it goes okay
all right
ill see you guys on on monday
love you
all right love you too bye
why do we have so many plants
all of a sudden
well have to return some of that stuff
so dont get too used to it
i find plants kind of scary
these plants are good guys
hey come here
yeah
tomorrow this woman is going to come
and visit us
and be with us while we eat dinner
is it your girlfriend
nono
is it mommys boyfriend
no why does mommy have a boyfriend
i dont know does she
i dont know
i dont know
why is someone watching us eat dinner
i know its weird
its just something we have to do
which has to do with
mommy and me figuring out everything
and how were going to be
um
you know
will you read to me
sure grab your book
do you use drugs or alcohol
i drink alcohol
how much alcohol do you drink
i dont know a glass of wine with dinner
sometimes more
how much more
its sometimes a
a few
i sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone
okay who do you split it with
i mean
if im having dinner with someone
and we order a bottle of wine
okay
you know like at a restaurant
when you say do you want to go
by the glass or do we get a bottle
you get a bottle
well sometimes
i mean sometimes i go by the glass
you know it depends
did you mean drugs ever
i have done drugs
in college
anything since youve been
i i dont do it regularly
anything since youve been a mother
pot a few times
coke once at a party
i mean henry wasnt with me
what would you say
are your strengths as a parent
i listen
i play
ii put in the time i
love
taking care of him
watching him grow
and sometimes
what they say about it goes so fast
is true but
sometimes its not
sometimes it goes too slow honestly
what are your weaknesses
im too precise i care too much
are those weaknesses
maybe not
you know he can be an asshole and
i can get really pissed off
and ill call him on being an asshole
im going to stop you there
when you do this for real
dont ever say that
people dont accept mothers
who drink too much wine
and yell at their child
and call him an asshole
i get it i do it too
we can accept an imperfect dad
lets face it the idea of a good father
was only invented like 30 years ago
before that
fathers were expected to be silent
and absent and unreliable and selfish
and we can all say
we want them to be different
but on some basic level
we accept them
we love them for their fallibilities
but people absolutely dont accept
those same failings in mothers
we dont accept it structurally
and we dont accept it spiritually
because the basis
of our judeochristian whatever
is mary mother of jesus
and shes perfect
shes a virgin who gives birth
unwaveringly supports her child
and holds his dead body when hes gone
and the dad isnt there
he didnt even do the fucking
god is in heaven
god is the father and god didnt show up
so you have to be perfect and charlie
can be a fuck up and it doesnt matter
you will always be held
to a different higher standard
and its fucked up
but that is the way it is
ooh whoosh
i think i rang the wrong bell
nancy katz
hi im charlie barber
henrys just playing in his room
nancy can i get you anything

kasimir und karoline by ödön von horváth

yes recently since nicoles
been working on the show in la
i come back and forth a lot
that sounds difficult
it is
and expensive ill try to take him
with me some of the time
but nicole doesnt like for him
to fly so much
well that can be hard on a child
all that recycled air
well hes sturdy
some parents wont take their kids
to a restaurant
because of these superbugs
i noticed on one visit to los angeles

nicole
can you help me with my zipper
charlie is in
cl
something
neat
and i rely on him
to keep things in order
he is energy con
i dont know what this word is
youre getting so good at reading
what is that
he doesnt look in the mirror too often
he cries easily
in movies
he is very selfsuf
selfsufficient
he can garn a sock
that means sew like a hole
and cook himself dinner
and ir
break it into two parts
ur on
not ur but ire
ire on
iron
a shirt
he rarely gets defeated
which i fell
feel like i always do
charlie takes all of my moods steadily
he doesnt give in to them
or make me feel bad about them
hes a great dresser
and never looks em
i dont know this one
embarrassing
embarrassing
which is hard for a man
you read it now
hes very competitive
he loves being a dad
he loves all the things
youre supposed to hate
like the tantrums
the waking up at night
its almost annoying how much he likes it
but then its mostly nice
he disappears into his own world
he and henry are alike that way
he can tell
people they have food in their teeth
or on their face in a way
that doesnt make them feel bad
charlie is selfmade
his parents i only met them once
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol
he moved to new york from indiana
with no safety net
and now hes more new yorker
than any new yorker
hes brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around
with the theater company
he casts a spell
that made everyone feel included
no one not even an intern
was unimportant
whats an intern
its like a
helper but who isnt paid
why arent they paid
theyre young theyre learning
i dont know maybe if they do a good job
they get paid later
okay keep going
he could remember all the inside jokes
hes extremely organized and thorough
hes very clear about what he wants
unlike me who cant always tell
i fell in love with him
two seconds after i saw him
and ill never stop loving him
even though
it doesnt make sense anymore
see you good seeing you
good seeing you too
charlie
