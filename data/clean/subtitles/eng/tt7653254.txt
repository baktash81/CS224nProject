hey  you look like you care about animals 
yes  i do 
she really listens
when someone is talking 
 do you want to sign up here 
 you know what  i   
it s funny  i actually signed up for this 
but i never heard from you guys 
sometimes she listens too much
for too long 
okay  if you e mail me here  
 thank you so much  have a good day 
 good luck 
she is a good citizen 
  just call him 
  i m not calling 
she always knows the right thing to do
when it comes to difficult family shit 
call him 
i get stuck in my ways 
and she knows when to push me
and when to leave me alone 
she cuts all our hair 
yeah 
she is always inexplicably
brewing a cup of tea
that she doesn t drink 
and it s not easy for her
to put away a sock  or close a cabinet 
or do a dish  but she tries for me 
nicole grew up in la around actors 
and directors  and movies  and tv 
and is very close to her mother  sandra 
and cassie  her sister 
note the wrapping 
nicole gives great presents 
she is a mother who plays  really plays 
 lizard 
 yeah 
she never steps off playing
or says iris too much 
 mom 
 and it must be too much some of the time 
    chopped down a christmas tree    
all right 
nice  two  three  four    what 
are you kidding me  i was just in jail 
goddamn it 
  do not laugh at me  stop it 
  she is competitive 
she is amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms 
which i ve always found very sexy 
she keeps the fridge over full 
no one is ever hungry in our house 
she can drive a stick 
how could you 
after that movie  all over the girl 
she could have stayed in la
and been a movie star 
but she gave that up to do theater with me
in new york 
you might as well get what you paid for 
she is brave 
she is a great dancer 
infectious 
she makes me wish i could dance 
she always says when she doesn t know
something  or hasn t read a book 
or seen a film or a play 
whereas i fake it or say something
like i haven t seen it in a while 
my crazy ideas are her favorite things
to figure out how to execute 
let s try it   
crawling   
but also standing 
she is my fa favorite actress 
what i love about charlie   
charlie is undaunted
he never lets other people s opinions
or any setbacks
keep him from what he wants to do 
and he liked me  so   
charlie eats like he s trying
to get it over with
and like there won  1  be enough food
for e everyone 
a sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured 
ls your sweater on backwards 
but he is incredibly neat 
and i rely on him to keep things in order 
so   
he s energy conscious 
hey 
sorry 
he doesn t look in the mirror too often 
i cried four times 
me too 
he cries easily in movies 
i wonder if it was the same four 
he is very self sufficient 
he can darn a sock 
and cook himself dinner  and iron a shirt 
how are we doing over here 
the peppers are cut 
he rarely gets defeated  which   
i feel like i always do 
   cut some carrots 
charlie takes
all of my moods steadily 
he doesn t give in to them
or make me feel bad about them 
he s a great dresser 
he never looks embarrassing 
which is hard for a man 
goddamn it  charlie  get it together 
he s very competitive 
come on 
  what s this  who owns baltic avenue 
  me 
how much is it 
 i don t have enough 
  450 
okay  so i m done 
i m done  right  that s it 
this is so frustrating 
this is so frustrating  i always lose 
  dad 
  he loves being a dad 
he loves all the things you re supposed
to hate  like the tantrums 
the waking up at night 
i had a bad dream 
it s okay 
it s almost annoying
how much he likes it 
but    then  it s mostly nice 
dad  stay 
he disappears into his own world 
shit 
  what s  shit  
  this is our stop 
he and henry are alike in that way 
he can tell people when they have food
in their teeth or on their face
in a way that doesn t make them feel bad 
did you get it  perfect 
charlie is self made 
his parents   
i only met them once  but   
he told me there was a lot of alcohol
and some violence in his childhood 
as soon as she comes with a lookout 
they re coming with a camcorder 
 camcorder 
 is that what they re called 
he moved to new york from indiana
with no safety net 
and now he s more new yorker
than any new yorker 
i made sure they used
the right almond milk 
genius 
he is brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around 
with the theater company  he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included 
no one  not even an intern 
was unimportant 
he could remember all the inside jokes 
and where do you go when it s windy 
yeah  that   that was funny 
he is extremely organized and thorough 
he s very clear about what he wants 
unlike me  who can t always tell 
let s stop right there 
who wants to start 
i i m not going to read this out loud 
why is that 
because i don t like what i wrote 
as we mediate your separation
and eventual divorce 
things can get quite contentious 
so  i like to begin
with a note of positivity 
for the people i work with to remember
why they got married in the first place 
and so that  as you come apart 
you re reminded that   
this is a person
you had great feeling for 
and maybe still do in many ways 
i ll read mine  i like what i wrote 
for it to really work 
you both have to read 
i m not going to 
okay  um   
i just think it s a shame
that you guys aren t going to get to hear 
the wonderful things
you wrote about each other 
she always says i can t write 
but i think mine s pretty good 
nicole  maybe you d change your mind
once you heard charlie s 
i don t want to hear charlie s 
we promised to listen 
that s right 
that s the very first step
in this process 
well  i think i m going to go
if you two are going to just sit around
and suck each other s dicks 
how can this evil allow moderation  
how can this evil allow moderation 
how can it be right
to betray the departed 
how is it human to be so   
faithless 
i want no praise from impious men 
no home with them of quiet ease 
noble blood still runs in my veins 
shall i fail my father   
stifling my cries 
clipping the wings of grief 
must his corpse in the ground
wretchedly waste away 
feebly count for nothing 
must his killers gloat   
must his killers gloat 
never to pay with blood  for blood   
charlie gave me the note 
but it s really for you 
 he told me to pick up my cues 
 how is that for me 
acting is reacting 
i m responding to you 
you re slowing me down 
frank  it s closing night  you know 
you don t think charlie and nicole
will ever get back together 
no  i think this time it s really over 
 it still feels weird 
 i feel like my parents are splitting up 
it s always been  charlie and nicole  
 is charlie still giving notes 
 yep 
you re lucky  nic 
i wish i was going to la 
you can actually have space in la 
there s no space here 
ladies and gentlemen 
i want to make a toast
to charlie   
and to our beloved nicole 
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure 
all the way to sunny california 
and we are also going to try
something new 
we are going to take our play to broadway 
it reminds me of when i was a young person
and went to broadway for the first time 
and i m telling you 
winning your first tony at 27 
it can mess with your head 
i mean  i was just a baby 
elia kazan was backstage   
i m going to go over there now 
  don t do it  mary ann 
     elbowing mike nichols 
and mike was chatting with dietrich 
and marlene  you know 
she usually was a barrel of monkeys 
but tonight she was very  very serious 
could you give me a second 
well  i d have to study it  but   
hey 
hey  i didn t expect you guys home
until late 
 how s he doing 
 good  good  he went to bed on time 
no fuss 
read him some of cricket in times square 
god  you guys are so attractive 
shit  sorry  i didn t stop that
from being said 
no  it s okay 
i ll pay for the whole time 
we decided to come home early 
hey  thanks 
and also the travel time 
   conversation
as well as anybody  but i ve gotta run 
     if you know what i mean 
  y  you re leaving 
  well  i ain t moving in 
we  we ll be back when you get your 
if you don t like that mediator 
we ll find another one 
  yeah 
  w we might not need a mediator 
we ll just split everything anyway 
i don t care 
  me neither 
  you can have most of it 
we ll get apartments near each other 
make it easier for henry 
we ll figure it out 
 we want the same things 
 right 
in the meantime 
the pilot will be fun for you 
you don t think it s bad  do you 
i don t ever watch tv 
so  you know  i can t tell 
i told henry i d come out to la
in two weeks to see him 
yes 
nothing 
i can tell you want to give me a note 
no  i don t 
yeah    i mean  yes  i do  but i guess   
i guess it doesn t matter now 
you won t be with the show anymore 
it s stupid 
you re not going to be able to sleep
until you tell me 
maybe not 
okay  then 
so  there are two things 
i thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified 
 okay 
 and then   
at the end  i could tell
you were pushing for the emotion 
well  you know i can t cry on stage 
and i know you don t like it
when i fake it  but   
i thought maybe tonight
it would come  but   
it didn t 
that s all i had 
thanks for indulging me 
good night  charlie 
  this is the day  
  this is the day that the lord has made  
  that the lord has made  
  let us rejoice  
  let us rejoice and be glad in it  
  and be glad in it  
 j  this is the day  
 mom 
g ma  summer is for relaxing 
 j  this is the day     
 what do you want to do today 
hang out and relax with you 
  me too 
  no relaxing 
nicole has a hair and makeup test today 
and henry  we got you into fairy camp
with the cousins 
i hate fairy camp 
cassie says everyone likes fairy camp 
and i think this is true 
henry  go make your mom some coffee
like i taught you 
mom  wait till you taste my coffee 
oop a doodle 
do you always sleep together 
even in new york 
no  it s just for right now
while we go through this transition 
shit 
don t tell charlie when he gets here 
he hates co sleeping 
well  i have to say  i agree with charlie 
surprise surprise 
  it s as if you have exploded   
  jesus  it s early 
   into this room 
i can do this part alone 
fine  i won t look 
as long as you re in my house 
wake up is at 6 30 a m  
and until you know what you want to do 
we re going to do what i like to do 
i can t just go from what charlie
wanted to do to what you want to do 
even though i am 64
and have a dead gay husband 
i manage to get up every day 
live my life 
and feel pretty good about myself 
so  maybe your mom knows a thing or two 
you know what i would do 
about what 
when charlie gets here 
i d whisk him off to palm springs 
that s what your father and i did
whenever we hit a speed bump 
didn t you walk in on dad
blowing the porter in palm springs 
and i always regretted
getting so upset about it 
charlie and i are getting a divorce  mom 
there s nothing for us in palm springs 
you need to wash your face
before you go to sleep 
when daddy gets here 
  maybe we could all go on the jaws ride 
  yeah 
or i could go once with daddy
and once with you 
because i wouldn t mind
going twice anyway 
no  we ll all go together  sweetheart 
did you know that universal studios
is where i did my first screen test 
on the plane  i re read the pilot
as if i were charlie reading it 
and i started to think it was just bad 
my agent says it s one to watch 
 this coffee is good  thank you 
 you re welcome 
what if charlie is on broadway
with a play i brought him 
which i originated 
and i m just doing bad tv 
everyone is only impressed
when they see someone on tv 
  she s beautiful 
  her wig looks great 
where s she been
the past ten years 
doing weird theater in new york 
downtown shit 
 i saw one  it rained onstage 
 can i say something 
it was good  edgy 
directed by her husband 
supposedly very controlling 
  we re lucky to have her 
  i m surprised she said yes 
  we can thank her divorce 
  can she move her hand 
it s going to be hard to roto in the hair
on the baby around her fingers 
can    you move your hand
further down the baby 
  where  like here 
  off the head entirely 
i have to support his head 
no  no  support the head  of course 
just try and do it from the    shoulders 
  it s perfect 
  yes  good 
i can t hold a baby like this 
she s right  that s going to look weird 
we can totally do it 
it ll just take time and money 
it was very important to me
to have this show based on hard science 
so we can see your pretty face
and not ours 
you should ve seen me
before the plants invaded 
i say that with respect 
i was raised by two mothers 
can you lower the board please  pablo 
here  how about here 
 how about now 
 why is there always a flirty grip 
i can do anything you want 
i just need her here two hours  
can i say something 
dennis  hold on  what  honey 
she has to know
how to hold a baby 
  later on  after she kills donny   
  she kills donny 
that s a secret 
we didn t give the crew those pages 
   she becomes a sort of a earth mother
to the plant community 
that s not going to make any sense
if we feel like she s a bad mother
to her own kid 
 she s right 
 does donny know 
 must be nice to get out of new york 
 well  i m from out here 
our daughter  mia  is at nyu 
living in a shoebox 
she says it went up to 104 the other day 
 we are just so excited to have you 
 i m excited to be here 
we re going for an early aughts aesthetic 
so having your presence just nails that 
what signifies early aughts 
into the girl was on tv   
 all over the girl 
    or streaming or something 
you are fucking hot in that movie 
 carol 
 fuck it  i speak my mind 
 we re not allowing our son to see it 
 because you show your tits 
 carol 
 yeah 
 dennis 
 this is carter mitchum 
he s a futurist at ucla 
he s consulting on all the environmental
stuff for the show so it s accurate 
 nice to meet you 
 is it 
 what 
 accurate 
so far  none of it 
this pilot will go 
so get ready to move back to la 
listen  everything you were saying
back there was absolutely right 
 if she s a bad mom  we lose the audience 
 nobody knows we re killing donny 
 including donny 
 i    i thought  
let us know if you d like to be part
of our writers  room 
i bet you d be really helpful  actually 
or i could direct 
 no  yeah 
 sorry  what  maybe that sounds crazy 
no  do you have a reel 
no  because i ve   i ve never done it 
i watched my husband do it for years 
almost ex husband 
what s the opposite of fiancé 
dennis and i will talk
to your agent about it 
at our theater i always wanted to direct 
and then charlie would say something like 
 the next one  
but he was always the director 
so there never was a next one 
i don t know  maybe if we d
stayed married  there would ve been 
yeah  no  we re going
to kill him off  it seems unlikely   
i m going to give you a number 
okay  is it a therapist 
because i have a therapist 
well  it s my mom s therapist 
we share her 
she s a lawyer  she represented me
when i left dennis 
you and dennis are divorced 
since 2013 
you still work together 
that s nice 
no  he s a fucking cocksucker 
nora got me half of this project
in the settlement 
well  we talked about doing it
without lawyers 
my sister had me meet
a bunch of them already 
and i    just    hated them 
call nora 
she saved my life 
sorry  i   
look so schleppy 
i had an event at my kid s school 
let me get this out of the way 
i think you re a wonderful actress 
thank you 
moved all over the girl 
but the theater stuff too   
you saw the theater stuff 
i was in new york last year for my book 
which  remind me to give you a copy 
and my publisher took me 
great 
 thank you 
 you are awesome 
  well  charlie directed it 
  i know 
he s very talented 
he is 
they re moving it to broadway 
well  without me  of course 
he was lucky to have you 
how are you doing 
sorry 
honey   
you take some breaths 
and while you do 
i m going to tell you about myself 
if you should choose to hire me 
i will work tirelessly for you 
and i m always available by phone or text 
except when i m with my kids 
i insist on doing drop off and pick up
every day at school 
  i understand 
  i ve been through this myself 
thank you  annie  so   
i know how it feels 
 you do 
 yes 
i have a kid from my ex 
who is a narcissistic artist   
and verbally abusive 
i m now with a great boyfriend
who lives in malibu 
good 
well  charlie s not terrible 
no  of course not 
but they ravish you with attention
in the beginning   
and then once we have babies 
we become the mom
and    they get sick of us 
yeah 
where do you want to live now  doll 
well   
i m here now  obviously 
i don t know
if the show will get picked up  but   
it feels like home 
it is home 
it s the only home i ve ever known
without charlie 
you want to stay here 
charlie s not going to want that  he   
he hates la 
we re interested in what you want to do 
sounds to me
like you did your time in new york 
he can do some time here  no 
he always said we would  but he never   
did 
how old is your son 
henry s eight 
yeah 
he likes la 
i don t know if it s fair to him 
i want you to listen to me 
what you re doing is an act of hope 
do you understand that 
yeah 
you re saying 
 i want something better for myself  
i do 
and this  right now  is the worst time 
it will only get better 
wasn t it tom petty who said 
 the waiting is the hardest part  
i don t know 
i represented his wife in their divorce 
i got her half of that song 
i don t want any money or anything 
i just worry because we weren t
going to use lawyers  so   
i don t want to be too aggressive 
i want to stay friends 
we ll do it as gently as possible 
now   
can you tell me a little more
about what s going on 
because part of what we re going to do
together is tell your story 
it s difficult to articulate 
it s   
not as simple
as not being in love anymore 
i understand 
why don t you start at the beginning 
wherever that is for you 
well   
i was engaged to ben
and living in la  you know 
and i felt like yes 
i want to make movies and marry ben 
jesus 
i was only 19 or 20 at the time 
i never felt older in my whole life 
anyway  if i was honest with myself 
it was like a small part of me
felt dead   
or dead ish 
you know  you tell yourself 
 no one s perfect 
no relationship s perfect  
this tea is delicious 
isn t it  it s the manuka honey 
anyway  you were asking about charlie 
so  um   
so  yes  so  i was    i was   
happy with ben and aware of the deadness 
and i went to new york
to meet with this director
for this space movie 
but one where they take space seriously 
like   
sex trafficking in space 
you know  it was political 
or at least they wanted us
to think it was 
anyway  it just   
it was really fulfilling the same need
that certain fucked up porn does 
um  but anyway  so   
while i was there   
the producer   
invited me to see a play 
it took place in someone s apartment
with all the lights on 
it was like nothing i d ever seen before 
this strange   
surreal  dystopian story 
and it was so well acted 
and one of the actors
was this big shaggy bear
who played all his lines
looking directly at me 
which i knew couldn t be the case 
but it felt like it 
and then later  of course 
i learned that it was 
 these cookies are really great too 
 i ll send you home with some 
afterwards  i was introduced to the cast 
and the bear turned out
to also be the director 
he talked to me and   
i talked back 
the dead part wasn t dead 
it was just in a coma 
and   
it was better than the sex  the talking 
although the   
the sex was also like the talking 
you know  everything is like everything
in a relationship 
don t you find that 
and  um   
so  we spent   
the whole night
and the next day together and   
i just never left 
yes  to be honest  all the problems
were there in the beginning too 
but    i just went along with him
and his life
because it felt so damn good
to feel myself alive 
in the beginning 
i was the actress  the star  and   
that felt like something  you know 
people came to see me at first  but   
the farther away i got from that and   
the more acclaim the theater company got 
i had less and less weight 
i just became   
 who  
 well  you know  the actress
that was in that thing that time  
and he was the draw 
and    that   
would ve been fine  but   
i got smaller 
i realized i   
i didn t ever really
come alive for myself 
i was just feeding his aliveness 
and   
you know   
he was so smart and creative  it   
it was fine 
you know  i would tell him things
at home in private 
and they would work their way into public
conversation  into his work  and   
for a while  that felt like enough 
i mean  i was just so   
so   
so flattered
that someone like him would   
would find an idea i had worth trying
or a comment i made worth repeating and   
and then  i got pregnant 
and i thought that having a baby
could be ours  could really be ours 
but also really mine 
and    you know  he was so excited 
so  it was nice 
for a while 
i mean  kids  they   
they belong to themselves  it s like   
the instant they leave your body 
it s just   
the process of them going away   
and i didn t belong to myself 
and it was small stuff  stupid stuff 
and big stuff 
all the furniture in our house
was his taste 
i didn t even know
what my taste was anymore
because i had never been asked to use it 
i didn t even pick our apartment 
i just moved into his 
and i made noises
about wanting to move back to la  but   
they came to nothing 
and we d come here on holidays
because he liked my family 
but if i suggested
we do a year or something 
he d just put me off 
it would be   
strange if he turned to me and said 
 and what do you want to do today  
you know  i just watched that documentary
on george harrison 
and i thought   own it 
just own it 
be like george harrison s wife 
being a wife and a mother  that s enough  
yeah  then i realized
i couldn t remember her name  so   
this pilot came along 
it shot in la and it paid so much   
and it was like there was
this little lifeline thrown to me 
here s this bit of earth that s yours 
and   
i was embarrassed about it
in front of him  but it was also like   
yeah  this is who i am 
and this is what i m worth 
and maybe it s stupid 
but at least it s mine 
and if he had just taken me
into a big hug and said 
 baby  i m so excited for your adventure 
of course i want you to have
a piece of earth that s yours  
then   
well  then 
we might not be getting divorced 
but   
he made fun of it and   
was jealous like he is  and   
then he realized about the money 
and he told me i could funnel it
back into the theater company 
and that s when i realized   
he   
truly didn t see me 
he didn t see me as something
separate from himself 
and i asked him to say my phone number 
laughs 
he didn t know it 
so  i left 
also  i think he slept
with the stage manager  mary ann 
that fucking asshole 
seventy five   
just 70 
those two zeros 
 seventy five point zero zero   
  if railroad is unowned   
 that s zero cents 
    you may buy it from the bank  
 advance to illios   
 illinois 
    illinois avenue  
 advance     what does that mean 
it means you ve got to go
to illinois avenue 
so where is illinois avenue 
that one 
so cassie  when charlie gets here 
you re going to hand him the envelope 
why do i have to do it 
because nicole is very good
at getting people to do things for her 
that s not what this is 
i wiped her butt
until she was nine years old 
she s very seductive that way 
no  mom  legally 
i can t be the one who serves him 
but still  what i m saying is true 
do i have to actually hand him
the envelope 
yes  but i m going to tell him in advance
that they re divorce papers 
nora says it doesn t have to be so formal 
where s henry 
he s playing in the living room
with sam  and jules  and molly 
let s get them upstairs 
charlie s going to be here soon 
sam  go upstairs 
so  i ll tell charlie
what s happening 
and  cassie 
you then hand him the envelope 
okay   
i just get nervous 
well  can you un serve 
  what do you mean  like take it back 
  yeah 
 i think so 
 you should check 
 in case we change our minds   
 i m not going to change my mind 
    or we feel too bad for him 
 maybe in case i do something wrong

  okay 
  and

i was going to warn you
so it didn t become a thing  i m sorry 
i feel like i m in a dream 
we don t have a marriage anymore 
l i know you don t want the disruption 
but you don t want to be married 
not    really 
but i don t want this 
what did you expect was going to happen 
i    i don t know 
i guess i didn t think it through 
but i thought we agreed
we weren t going to use lawyers 
i want   
i don t know  i m trying to say this
as undramatically as possible 
i want   
an entirely different kind of life 
let s wait until you finish this pilot
and come back to new york 
let s figure it out there 
at home  together 
 nora s known for being very fair 
 we don t need to do it with envelopes 
 this is nora 
 yeah 
she s great  i feel like
we could be friends with her 
 why do i feel like that won t happen 
 it s just a formality 
 why   
 you don t have to respond right away 
why did cassie have a pie 
the pie was hers 
the pie wasn t part of it 
are you sure 
i mean  what would the pie
have to do with anything 
i don t know  it somehow makes it worse 
i m sorry  but the pie was just a pie 
so  what   
what do i do 
you get a lawyer too 
 well  i guess l better be going 
stuart rose from the ditch 
climbed into his car   
and started up the road
that led toward the north 
the sun was just coming up
over the hills on his right 
as he peered ahead into the great land
that stretched before him 
the way seemed long   
but the sky was bright 
and he somehow felt
he was headed in the right direction  
i forgot it ended that way 
yeah  wow  stuart really overreacted 
didn t you think 
he was upset about his boat 
dad  you go away 
mom  you stay 
 hey  daddy just got here 
 it s okay 
love you 
you can come back  and wake me up 
and read to me later  daddy  okay 
okay 
will you come sleep in my bed later 
yeah 
on 
hang in there  charlie bird 
thanks  g ma 
 he s in a mommy phase right now 
 it s okay 
whoo 
i m sorry  i drank too much wine 
 i can imagine 
 and didn t eat dinner 
stressful time 
i hope henry didn t notice 
i m sure he didn t 
now that i m a parent 
i realize my parents
were probably drunk all the time with me 
yeah 
i m sorry again 
thanks 
where are you staying 
well  i   
hadn t   
i guess i ll   
there s a new hotel on highland that s   
supposedly not too expensive
and    and pretty nice 
okay  i ll check it out 
again  that s great
about the macarthur 
thanks 
 charlie 
 yeah 
thanks 
fuck 
 what 
 she s being represented by nora 
she s supposedly very fair 
all right  here s the fact  jack 
i charge  950 an hour 
ted is 400 
if you have a stupid question 
you call ted 
to start  we ll need a  25 000 retainer 
 that s more than i can  
 and all your financials 
we need to do a forensic accounting 
which runs anywhere
from ten to twenty thousand dollars 
but if we can all agree right away 
it shouldn t get too bad  right 
you were married here in la 
yes    because her mom and sister
are out here
 and i m not close with my family 
 your son was born out here 
yes  because  again  her mom
and sister are out here and i m not  
so  you got married here 
your kid was born here   
and she served you here 
yeah  but we lived in new york 
why 
 is there a problem 
 we ll have to reshape the narrative 
if you re serious
about having your child in new york 
this is what i suggest 
you take your kid   
d did you say his name was fred 
henry 
henry 
why did i say fred 
i have a kid named fred 
you take henry to new york
with you right now 
then we file an action in new york 
we make this a new york case 
we need to make an argument
you re a new york based family 
well  we are 
otherwise  you ll probably never
see your kid outside of la again 
really  no 
it s very hard
to convince the courts to move a kid 
as soon as you let your wife and child
leave new york 
you made life very difficult for yourself 
yes  but as i said 
we re a new york family 
that s just a fact 
she s    here temporarily 
then why do you think
she served you out here 
i don t    know 
but henry wants to go back to new york 
don t quote your kid 
he s just telling you
what you want to hear 
and trust me 
he s telling her the opposite 
let me have the barber file 
it s right here 
move my lunch to 1 30 
what s   
 exit goat  
exit ghost  it s the name
of my theater company 
you re a director 
theater director  yeah 
 anything i ve seen 
 i don t know  what have you seen 
our production of electra
is moving to broadway   
which is exciting 
we have to make sure
that money is protected 
i mean  it s theater 
so it s not a lot of money 
i basically put whatever money i make
back in the theater 
i wonder  do we ask for support 
  interesting 
  from nicole 
i m not going to do that 
does your wife s family have money 
her mother has some
from her tv career 
and her father died 
well  we could say that we don t want
her mother to see the kid 
draw her into the case 
in that instance 
her mother could pay your legal fees 
no 
i m very close to her mom 
 nicole s family has been my family  
 yeah  but that s going to change 
and i suggest you get used to it 
 we need to hire a private investigator 
 really  i mean   
 really 
 does your wife do drugs or anything 
coke 
not in any real way 
well  we re not going to win
if she s the perfect mother 
she was addicted to tums for a while 
it wasn t nothing 
she was up to a tube a day 
have you noticed anyone following you 
no 
well  keep an eye out 
look  you need to be prepared for the fact
that nora is going to portray you
as a neglectful  absent father 
  but i m not 
  you live in new york 
you re consumed with your work 
she and your kid are out here  struggling 
nora s going to use that strategy 
i m sure of it 
but nicole s not going to lie 
listen  if we start from a place
of reasonable 
and they start from a place of crazy 
when we settle  we ll be somewhere
between reasonable and crazy 
which is still crazy 
half of crazy is crazy 
you know what people say   criminal
lawyers see bad people at their best 
divorce lawyers see good people
at their worst  
before this is all over 
you re going to hate me and ted 
just because of what we represent
in your life 
i m sure you re right 
so tell me the story again 
you came out here to see your kid 
 maybe i m not explaining this well 
 she serves you 
 we re friendly  we re fine 
 what a bitch 
we re just trying to figure this out 
she s not a bitch 
thanks  but this isn t   
we re doing it a different way 
and    i can t even close to afford this 
i ve got to get back to new york 
i have a broadway play in rehearsals 
i was the hot shit at that time 
young  very sexy 
with a great head of hair 
i just so appreciate that charlie
gave me this opportunity 
or maybe i should thank nicole 
i heard nicole s pilot went to series 
so she s moving to la 
and they put henry in school out there 
well  is charlie moving too 
not charlie 
he won t abandon us 
and you can t do theater in la 
charlie said she and henry
are coming back to new york
when she finishes filming her show 
i wouldn t be so sure 
nicole was never going to stay
in new york  that was obvious 
she was probably
planning this move all along 
when she sees an opportunity 
believe me  she takes it 
well  la is nice 
the space 
miss four time oscar winner  sucking my   
okay  how is everyone today 
nobody get too close 
i think i caught donna s cold 
 sorry  charlie 
 i m expecting a skype call from henry 
so i might have to step out 
so  charlie  what you re going through now
is going to be horrible 
but it will be over 
thanks  frank 
 another thing 
 yeah 
fuck as many people as you can right now 
women  men 
 take what i said seriously 
 you might need help wrapping gauze 
 it needs to stay tight 
 okay  i m   i m confused 
what    scene
is the invisible man outfit for 
no  that s my halloween costume 
and the frankenstein
is for henry 
he s coming here this weekend 
we re going to trick or treat
in the slope 
i made it more james whale
than kenneth branagh 
 perfect 
 can i talk to you 
yeah  over   
i ve typed up the blocking
from the last two rehearsals 
and here are the director notes
from that danish production from the  70s 
where d you find it 
 the library  duh 
 ha 
can i come over tonight 
mary ann  it s too hard now 
i just can t be with anyone right now 
but we did it when you were married
and we shouldn t have done it 
and now that you re not married 
shouldn t we be doing it 
i m not not married yet 
you re torturing yourself 
just make sure
everything doesn t go to hell 
 i m relying on you  okay 
 fine 
 thanks 
 i wish you d accept generosity better 
hold on  let me   
  hello 
  is this charlie barber 
yes 
hi  this is nora fanshaw 
i represent your wife  nicole barber 
  hi 
  do you have an attorney yet 
no 
okay  then it is okay for me
to talk to you directly  okay 
okay 
i  m calling because we haven t
received your response to our filing 
yeah  i ve been rehearsing this play
and flying back and forth to la 
you re going to need
to file your response 
  nicole said there was no rush 
  it s been more than 30 days
since you were served 
by law  you re meant to respond
within 30 days 
i didn t like the first lawyer i met 
it says that very clearly
on the document you were given 
did you read it 
yeah  but i thought
that s just what it says 
we weren t even going to do it
with lawyers 
charlie  i think i shouldn t
tuck in my shirt 
  nicole said i could take my time 
  and we ve let you take your time 
 keeps coming out during the love scene 
 could you hold a second  what love scene 
when i hug beth 
you don t hug beth 
i think it s something we should explore 
can t you just tuck it in tighter
or get donna to safety pin it 
i also have a kind of a thing
  about  tucking things in 
  charlie 
if you don t file your response 
we  re going to file a request
for default judgment against you 
   insecurities about my figure 
  charlie 
  yes  sorry 
default judgment  what does that mean 
don t hug beth 
we  ll be able to lay claim
to whatever we want 
w what do you mean 
whatever you want of what 
your apartment  your things 
everything you own 
we   
she and i already discussed this 
we don t own that much stuff 
she can have
pretty much whatever she wants 
and it means we  ll set the number
for child support at its highest level
and claim full custody of your child 
full custody 
  i mean  that s not even  
 this is what the law says 
nicole s not going to do that 
i mean  she won t 
no  charlie  l represent nicole 
and she s aware of everything
i m saying to you 
i just spoke to her this morning 
well  i spoke to her five minutes
before i go  on the call 
okay  so what do i do 
you need to get a lawyer
and respond immediately 
nicole wants to do this amicably 
but you re leaving us no other option 
i ll get a lawyer 
can i get a lawyer here 
  i don t know where  here   is 
  new york 
i that s what all that honking is  
no  you ll have to come to la
and meet people in la 
i m rehearsing a  
if you don t respond in los angeles by friday  you ll leave us no choice 
wh   which line 
i have to take this 
can you hold on a second  charlie  
me and mommy are in the middle
of a super secret treasure hunt 
 i thought the plane landed at nine 
 what are you wearing 
sock pants 
it did  what are sock pants 
he doesn t like to feel the breeze
on his legs 
he dressed himself 
 there are long pants  can i talk to you 
 it s almost noon 
there was traffic  we ve got to get going 
 why don t we ever do a treasure hunt 
 henry  can you wait a minute 
no talking alone 
just one bit of talking alone 
then i ll be right there 
i got a call from your lawyer 
she said you d take everything and   
custody and everything
if i didn t respond 
it s better if we just
let the lawyers do this 
yeah  but she s saying things
i don t think you mean 
henry  we need to get going 
i don t want to go now 
 have you gotten a lawyer yet 
 that s what i m here to do 
come on  henry  i m in a rush 
i have three more clues 
why did you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my arrival 
 cool 
 you were late  we were killing time 
honey  come  we re going to finish
the treasure hunt later 
  i m going to be rich 
  okay 
you re going to go with your daddy 
it s going to be fun 
and i ve got a present for you
when you get back as a reward 
he s not going to the dentist 
 i m trying to help 
 i m staying here 
come on 
henry 
  got the booster 
  i have a booster 
wait  no  it s not in 
what s not in 
the seat s not connected 
i asked the rental company to install it 
yeah  i think they can t
for liability reasons 
 do you know how these things  
 let me just    if you   
  there should be a clip to clip onto 
     dig   
 effort grunts 
fuck 
  why  fuck  
  something sharp 
 can t i stay with mom 
 no 
why not 
it s my time with you 
i just flew 3 000 miles 
i don t want to 
henry  get in the fucking car 
i m sorry  but jesus 
get in the fucking car 
how do you spell lego bionicles 
that s two words 
what does lego start with 
just tell me 
 don t you want to learn it 
 no 
 it s on the box  anyway 
 l   
then what 
e    you know 
everyone at the theater says hi 
hi 
then what 
a         sound 
 are you excited for halloween 
 j 
g 
  then what 
  and an  o  sound 
 o 
 are you excited for halloween 
yeah 
i brought both our costumes 
i m going as a store bought ninja 
but we agreed 
i had donna make you a frankenstein 
i don t want to be a frankenstein anymore 
are you sure 
maybe just look at it 
it s awesome  we ll be frankenstein
and the invisible man 
mom bought me a ninja costume 
which is better because it costs more 
technically  the frankenstein cost more
when you factor in donna s time
and the materials 
the cousins are also going to be ninjas 
but henry 
we went through all this trouble 
okay 
whatever you want 
please take the ticket 
  dad  you re too far 
  i know 
please take the ticket 
so  i m not comfortable
leaving the bags in the car
where i ve given the key to someone
i don t really know 
i ve been here 
it s an office building 
so you ve been to places like this before 
i remember those fish 
a lot of fish look the same 
can i help you 
i m charlie barber 
i have a 1 30 with dan cohen 
hi  where s your little man 
i don t have it this time 
i keep my skeletons at my mom s 
okay 
okay 
i m sorry  we tried to reach you 
mr  cohen wanted me to apologize 
he can t see you because apparently
your wife already met with him
on the 7th of august about representation 
b but she hired somebody else 
      nora  
 fanshaw 
but unfortunately  because she consulted
with mr  cohen already 
he s legally barred from representing you 
  should we feed the fish 
  yeah 
  it happens all the time 
  really 
if you have a ticket 
i can validate your parking 
you know  it s common that people
meet with as many lawyers as possible
so that their spouse has limited options 
i don t think
she would ve done it deliberately 
you d be surprised 
can all of them  like 
breathe out of the water 
did you go to a lot of offices
with your mom 
not so many 
like 11 
i don t think anyone
would have stealed the bags  daddy 
i need somebody today 
if i don t respond by tomorrow 
she said i could lose custody 
i didn t know who else to call 
there s got to be someone she didn t meet 
i have a name for you 
bert spitz 
he was the entertainment lawyer
at roberta s agency 
great 
but then he kind of got pushed
into retirement a few years ago 
and he went into family law 
 i called him 
 thank you  g ma 
  he can see you today at three 
  aw  shit 
we never had this conversation 
charlie bird 
you got it  i love you 
  aw 
  dad 
 i need a new burger 
 why 
because you made us carry your bags
into the restaurant  i dropped it 
that s fine  i ll give you mine 
get in the car 
why did you bring me today
if you couldn t hang out with me 
because i ve been away
and want to see you 
jamie tuber has a little sister   
   named  um  lily tuber 
 yeah 
 and lily tuber is really bossy 
getting divorced with a kid can be
one of the hardest things you ll ever do 
it s like a death without a body 
i know personally 
i ve been there four different times 
you ve been divorced four times 
married four times 
three divorces 
this last one will stick  god willing 
that s why i graduated into family law 
to help people survive this painful time 
here s how i see it 
if we get bogged down
in  who did this   and  who did that  
and  i don t want to pay the two dollars  
it ll just cost you more money
and time and   
emotional stress 
and you ll probably end up
with the same result anyway 
right 
i mean  i agree with that philosophy 
she does too  i m sure 
and i always go with the truth 
no matter where that takes us 
you know  most people in my business
make up the truth
so they can get where they need to go 
you re just transactions to them 
l i like to think of you as people 
okay  good 
and not just you  her too 
yes 
you know  this can be
a really ugly process 
but i also believe
it doesn t have to be terrible 
i m glad to hear you say that 
um   
i d love to keep expenses down
as much as possible 
of course you do 
i charge 450 an hour
and i need a  10 000 retainer to start 
i ll see if i can get an advance
on the broadway transfer 
and keep in mind 
you ll have to pay for her lawyer 
i didn t   
  what 
  well  at least part of her 
it doesn t make sense  does it 
i mean  you re doing this
because you love your kid 
and in doing so  you re draining money
from your kid s education 
  it seems ridiculous 
  it is 
it is  boy 
we ll have to respond right away 
your son goes to school out here 
yeah  temporarily  we agreed 
her pilot went to series
and i wanted to accommodate her 
as she s often felt
we do things on my terms 
be a better husband in divorce 
i guess something like that 
but we live in new york 
well  with your kid
going to school out here 
the court may see it differently 
will we go to court 
no  no  we don t want to go to court 
the courts in california are a disaster 
no  that s just how
we have to think about it 
i m not sure these are my glasses 
where are you living while you re here 
i m in a hotel right now 
no  a hotel doesn t look good 
 to who 
 the court 
you just said
we weren t going to go to court 
no  of course  of course 
we have to prepare to go to court 
hoping we don t go to court 
okay 
you should get a place in la 
and get a place near her 
it looks better for custody reasons 
she s in west hollywood 
that ll be expensive 
l i guess i could rent
our new york apartment 
don t rent it 
you have to continue to prove
new york residence 
and of course  if you have a place in la 
it s hard to show you all live
in new york  isn t it 
so   
what do i do 
i recommend you spend
as much time as you can with your son 
many people fight for that time 
then they don t even use it 
they just want to win 
this shouldn t be
that complicated  right 
i mean  we re a new york family 
i think it s all pretty straightforward 
right 
i hope so  yes 
i see no reason   
you both love your child 
you respect each other 
why this shouldn t be
relatively pain free 
right 
i think you have my glasses 
that makes sense 
  what have you been doing 
  reading this magazine 
you were reading california lawyer 
yeah 
okay  i m almost done 
i wouldn t expect too much from that cat 
 what kind of pet do you want 
 i don t know   
i want you to know
that eventually this will all be over 
and whatever we win or lose   
it ll be the two of you
having to figure this out together 
thank you 
you re the first person in this process
who s spoken to me like a human 
you remind me of myself
on my second marriage 
come  come  come  come 
you have fun with daddy 
we drove around to offices 
do you want to see your ninja costume 
it s on g ma s bed 
 yeah 
 yeah 
you know  i had donna build him
this whole frankenstein thing
with the plugs and  
yeah  well  the cousins are ninjas 
so he wanted to do that  
but he and i had decided together 
well  i can t make him
be frankenstein 
i m not asking you to 
but maybe you can help me out a little 
i ll leave the frankenstein here  maybe
you can nudge him in that direction 
i ll try 
what s the   
did you dye your hair again 
is that for your show 
no  this is me  it was this way
when i saw you before 
i know  but i didn t say anything then 
you don t like it 
no  i guess it s fine 
is it shorter  i prefer longer  but   
sorry  it s just absurd 
is everything okay 
yeah  why 
you seem  i don t know 
like something is  
everything s fine 
okay  i m going to check in at the hotel 
but i should be able to get to you guys
by 5 00  5 30  
we re going to cassie s in pasadena
and trick or treating with the cousins 
cassie lives in pasadena now 
yes  she and sam moved there
a couple months ago

 i ll figure it out  what s the address 
 my mom is looking forward to it   
 i ll text sam 
    and cassie and sam are mad 
 mad at who 
 you 
  cassie and sam 
  you can understand that 
so  i think we should probably do
separate halloweens 
but if you re okay with it 
then shouldn t they be okay with it 
 let s do it this way this time 
 do you not want me there 
i m fine with it 
  okay 
  it ll be nice for him 
he ll have two halloweens 
what am i going to do with him for second
halloween  walk around sunset boulevard 
maybe the hotel has something  or you can
drive to a different neighborhood 
the sun sets forever 
there shall never be another dawn 
no 
lady   
i require the solace of the shadows   
and the dark 
okay  ready for halloween 
 hi

i want to talk about it as us 
who the fuck is  us  
let s just get in a room  you and me 
that s what we always said we d do 
 my lawyers wouldn t let me sign anything 
 it s our divorce 
they say i could later sue them
for malpractice 
what am i walking into 
what are you walking into 
yes  what the fuck is going on 
i read your fucking e mails  charlie 
i read them all 
  when 
  i don t know  recently 
  shit 
  you re a fucking liar 
 you fucked mary ann 
 it was after i was sleeping on the couch 
all this bullshit about working on us 
you know what  i have been working 
i ve been doing the work alone 
how did you read my e mails 
i hacked into your account  you dumb fuck 
i think that s illegal 
don t give me this shit
about being surprised about la 
surprise  i have my own opinions 
how do you even know
how to do something like that 
surprise  i want things
that aren t what you want 
because  surprise 
you were fucking another lady 
it was one time  i think you re conflating
two different things 
mary ann has nothing to do with la 
i am conflating  motherfucker 
you watch me conflate 
did you just stamp your foot 
i don t think i ve ever done that before 
i m just so angry 
  you look like you needed one 
  yes  i do  thanks 
you know  the japanese are making
really interesting tequila right now 
that s exciting  i guess 
 what are you so angry about 
 my fucking ex husband 
i spent all this time feeling guilty 
and he s so self absorbed 
it s pointless 
it s a game i m playing with myself 
hey  pablo  we met at  
 you held the bounce board 
 the flirty grip 
 here s what i want you to only do  okay 
 what 
 i want you to finger me 
 what 
 just finger me 
 okay 
that s all we re going to do 
just fingering  okay 
i m changing my whole fucking life 
nicole and charlie s son  henry 
was born here in los angeles 
he currently attends laurel elementary
in laurel canyon 
and nicole works in hollywood
while also maintaining a full schedule
as a mother
with classes of swim  art 
gym  and music  as well as play groups 
nicole is henry s
primary custodial parent 
and to the extent that charlie
would like to exercise his custodial time 
he should be making efforts
to visit henry here in california 
nora  you seem to be ignoring the fact
that they lived in new york for ten years 
my client worked in new york
for several years  that s true 
but nicole was born and bred
right here in la 
she and charlie would come here
most holidays and summers
to spend time with her family 
who all live in la 
she and charlie were married in la 
would you like to see the photos 
no  i don t need to see the photos 
although i m sure
they both look beautiful 
it s my client s expectation
that after this tv show is completed 
the parties will move back to new york
where they currently keep an apartment 
and it s my understanding
that charlie promised nicole
that they would spend more time
in los angeles during the marriage 
but because of his insistence
that his work keep them in new york 
nicole ended up staying there much longer
than she ever anticipated 
in fact  a few years ago 
charlie was offered a residency
at the geffen playhouse
that would have taken his work
and his family
to los angeles for a year 
and he  um   
turned it down 
even though that was nicole s desire 
he wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child 
was this the same consistency
he wanted to maintain
when they went to copenhagen
for six months so he could direct a play 
now  while i understand
charlie lives in new york   
and when it s convenient to his work
schedule  he flies out to see his son   
he flies out here every chance he gets 
at great expense 
i don t see any reason
you can t be out here full time 
he makes his living in new york 
 sorry  do we want to contemplate lunch 
 good idea 
i ll order now so it ll come
when we re all hungry 
yeah 
  everyone good with manny s 
  i d love manny s 
have you had manny s 
you ll love it 
just really yummy sandwiches and salads 
i ll have the blt 
dad 
turkey 
i ll have the blt 
 you ll have the kale 
 kale salad 
i don t know  sorry 
charlie will have  um   
the greek salad 
but with lemon and olive oil
instead of the greek dressing 
okay 
  i ll have the chinese chicken salad 
  okay  sure 
 thank you 
 yeah 
congratulations  charlie  on your grant 
nicole told me 
thank you 
he s a genius 
well  i told nicole
i loved your play 
  really 
  thanks 
you are one smart cookie 
thanks 
i would just love to   
crawl inside that brain 
there was that one moment
when you smell the toast  smell 
it was literally my favorite thing
that i saw that year 
  thanks 
  truly genius 
thank you 
i was sorry to hear it closed on broadway 
they couldn t smell the toast 
it was so emotional 
laughs 
it s very competitive  i imagine 
now  when charlie is in los angeles 
nicole  of course  agrees
that it will be best for henry
that he see each parent equally 
it s very nice out here  charlie 
you should give it a chance 
yeah  and the space    you can t beat it 
i love it too 
but all of our personal feelings
about the two cities aside 
we don t share your assertion
that the couple is an la based family 
it was very clearly their deal
that they would go back to new york
after nicole finished her show 
i m not aware of any deal 
well  i didn t get it in writing 
charlie  is this like the deal
that you made
that you and nicole would spend more time
in la during your marriage 
we didn t have a deal 
it was something we discussed 
but   
so  it s a deal
when it s something you want
and a discussion when nicole wants it 
sidebar   
nora  do you have a spare office
where charlie and i can sidebar 
sure 
 can you  um   
 i can show you 
come on 
nora is a very good lawyer 
 tough  right 
 yeah 
and you re in a bind because you ve shown
you re willing to fly out here
and rent an apartment to see your son 
 you told me to do that 
 i know that 
and i m doing that because i want
to see my kid  not to set a precedent 
yes  but unfortunately 
you are setting a precedent 
and a judge might look at it that way 
what s the alternative  i stay in new york
and never come out here 
no  because then it would look
to the court
like you don t care about seeing your son 
court or no court  stop saying  court 
and then  never court  
well  the way this is going 
we may have to go to court 
 are you aware of how maddening you sound 
 i am 
and i know it seems unfair 
but imagine if you were   
a poor mother whose husband abandons her 
and then refuses to pay anything 
that s what the system
is trying to protect people from 
listen   
if i were representing you  
you are representing me 
right  no  of course  no   
i don t see a judge
moving this child from california 
i think we try and settle today 
settle meaning what 
she gets la 
no  bert  just   
no 
i mean  we have to win this 
remember  the win
is what s best for henry 
and if you guys go to court 
he s going to get pulled into it 
but if he stays here
and i stay in new york  that s just   
then i won t   
i ll never get to really be
his parent again 
it ll be different 
it won t exist 
so maybe you move here 
you heard what amir said about the space 
fuck the space  bert  fuck the space 
i ll do whatever you want me to do 
but this is my advice 
i ve seen these things go on and on 
and the burden of these battles
is immeasurable 
i had a client get colon cancer and die
before he and his wife came to agreement 
what about filing in new york 
it s too late 
and even if you did 
i don t think it would matter 
they re being reasonable financially 
you know 
you re   you re lucky they didn t ask
for half your grant money 
she wouldn t do that  she knows
i put all that money back in my theater 
if this continues  she might 
the actors and crew
all rely on that money 
the court would never agree
with this  right 
whether they do or not 
it ll cost you half your grant money
to go to court and prove it 
i feel like a criminal 
but you didn t commit any crime 
it doesn t feel that way 
if we give on la right now 
and then try to make
the best deal possible 
i think we can get her
to give on other fronts 
there are no other fronts 
this is the thing 
he needs to know that i fought for him 
he ll know 
i should never have
let her come out here with henry 
if it wasn t la and new york 
it d be something else 
you d be fighting about a house 
or a school district  or   
you know what this is like 
this is like that joke about the woman
at the hairdresser  she s going to rome 
 do you know this 
 i don t 
this woman is at her hairdresser
and she says 
 i m going to rome on holiday  
and he says   really 
what    what airline are you taking  
she says   alitalia  
he says   alitalia  are you crazy 
that s the worst   
that s terrible  don t take that  
he says   where are you going to stay  
she says   i m going to stay
at the hassler  
 the hassler  what  are you kidding 
they re renovating the hassler 
you ll hear hammering all night long 
you won t sleep 
what are you going to see  
she says   i think i m going to try
to go to the vatican  
 the vatican 
you ll be standing in line all day long 
you ll never get to see anything   
i m sorry  bert 
am i paying for this joke 
whatever happens here  it s temporary 
he s growing up  he s going to have
opinions on the subject 
time is on your side  charlie 
maybe he ll do college on the east coast 
i have most of my coins 
like my quarters and dimes  at daddy s   
  right 
     but i m keeping my dollars
and my one twenty at yours  okay 
so  that is one twenty plus 50 
what is that 
goddamn it 
what s  goddamn it  
did you guys lose power where you are 
dad  did we lose power 
no 
there is rolling blackouts
in the hills and no w   
damn it 
now the gate won t close 
her gate won t close 
morn 
hey 
  can we go see my room 
  yeah  of course 
 you tried all the  
 i tried everything 
sorry i made you come out 
it s fine 
 i just  
 you don t want your gate open 
right 
 there should be a panel or something  
 maybe this is something here 
  it s a cute house 
  yeah 
i mean  from what i can see 
thanks 
you re getting shaggy 
yeah  i have to find a hair cutter 
you want me to cut it 
okay 
close your eyes 
he s out 
maybe he should stay here tonight 
it s my night 
hey  come on  we re going 
come on  let s take a walk  right 
yeah  we re going to take a walk 
 we re taking a walk 
 fine  all right  she s crazy 
we re mostly finished 
bert and i hammered out
90 percent of the details 
and there s a couple minor things hanging 
but it should be easy 
and then the judge
makes your divorce official 
that s good 
  fuck me 
  what 
who s that 
charlie shouldn t have done this 
what do you mean  where s bert 
this means that everything
we ve agreed upon now is off the table 
we ve got la  right 
not with jay marotta representing him 
this is a street fight now 
and i m going to have to ask for things
that we wouldn t normally ask for 
this system rewards bad behavior 
 jay 
  hey 
hi 
i saw miriam at madeo the other night 
 yeah 
 looking very handsome 
you know  you should come
to our stand up to cancer event 
  john legend s going to play 
  love him 
okay  it s going to be
at the beverly hilton  i think 
  great 
  okay 
she said you re spending
more time in malibu 
  really 
  me too 
i haven t seen her
since that building was icm 
a little history   
ten years ago  charlie takes a risk
when he first hires nicole as an actress
in his play in new york city 
he s a well regarded
up and coming director
of the avant garde 
and she s known
as the girl in that college sex movie
who takes her top off 
 my client will not be slut shamed   
 ten years on   
   for an artistic choice 
   and many prestigious
theater roles later   
she becomes an actress
of great credibility 
and it s because of that credibility 
that she s offered the lead role
in a major television show 
this new opportunity is thanks to charlie 
your honor  we shouldn t have to pay
support money at this point 
in fact  charlie is entitled
to half her tv money 
present and future earnings of the show 
charlie s just received
the enormous sum of  650 000
in the form of a macarthur grant 
 of which he gets   
 this is for the theater work   
    he conducted during the marriage 
    in 125 000 installments
   over five years 
 so by jay s same logic  this is work   
 he uses the money   
    that nicole contributed to 
 to employ actors and crew members   
 one at a time  please 
    and to pay debts that he s accumulated
with his theater company
that stars his wife 
  bless you 
  not only did she turn down
a lucrative and successful career
in movies
to perform in his little theater 
but she actually supplied charlie
with a loan early on to help out 
 which he paid back 
 she lent her name to the marquee 
which was the principle reason
people came to the theater 
that may have been true ten years ago 
and in turn 
she helped establish charlie s reputation 
now  over the next ten years 
she was subsequently offered parts
in movies  tv shows 
most of which she turned down
at charlie s behest
to be a mom and act in his plays 
so  while we are willing to be flexible
on support 
we contend that half of charlie s
grant money be split between the parties 
i don t see how you can claim
that she gets half a grant
dedicated to his genius 
he became a genius during the marriage 
come on  nora 
charlie himself  upon hearing
that he received the prize 
told nicole that it belonged to her too 
that s what people say
when they win awards 
no  he was implying what was true 
his genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage 
nora  i like how you refer
to charlie s theater
as a ramshackle downtown dump
when you re arguing custody 
but when you want more money 
he s a big  rich  genius
broadway director 
you can t have it both ways 
really  why not 
and whether you think
it s fair or not  jay 
the first monetary installment
from the macarthur grant
was put into a joint marital account 
and thus became communal property 
fuck  you shouldn t have put
that money in a joint account 
there s not going to be anything left 
anyway  i m using it all to divorce her 
nora  i have to say
that your account of this marriage
takes place in an alternate reality 
by suddenly moving to la
and insisting on an la residence 
nicole is withholding henry   
  counsel  please be seated 
     alienating him from his father 
which has turned charlie s world
upside down 
  counselor 
  it amounts to an ambush 
 withholding   jay  really   alienating  
well  those are fighting words 
and it s simply false and does nothing
to further this settlement 
your recap of this situation
is outrageous 
and although california is 
without doubt  a no fault state 
it bears mentioning
in the accurate recap of this situation
that charlie had had extramarital affairs 
 an extramarital affair 
 do you really want me to go there 
  yeah  let s go there 
  okay 
nicole has admitted
to hacking charlie s computer
and reading his e mails 
which  if proven  is a felony 
and  nora 
i don t think you d be too happy
if i ask nicole about her alcohol
consumption in the evenings 
what 
she confided in charlie
one night recently 
having just carried henry to bed 
that she was having trouble standing
while walking down the staircase 
and from what i understand 
this is not an isolated event 
so you let me know  nora 
 and we will go there as needed 
 charlie 
can i ask you 
how do you expect
to have more time with henry
when you don t exercise the time
you already have 
and exercise it responsibly 
on a recent visit to los angeles 
after failing to call  text 
communicate in any way  shape  or form 
charlie finally arrived two hours late
to pick up henry
at nicole s mother s house 
at that point  the car seat 
which he had assured nicole
had been professionally installed 
was clearly not even belted in 
 it was just sitting in the back seat 
 you have to buckle in the car seat 
 it s the law 
 i know 
 i thought the rental place did it 
 they can t  it s a liability 
i know that now 
once we discovered that  we fixed it 
counsel 
you can see my courtroom is full
and there are people who don t have
the resources your clients have 
and i m fairly certain
you haven t exhausted  in good faith 
the arguments in the case of this child 
in the meantime 
we ll keep the status quo 
this remains an la family
for the time being 
i took over this department recently 
and i m still becoming acquainted
with the cases 
so  i m going to appoint
an expert evaluator
who knows much more about young children
than i do 
once the evaluation is done 
we ll modify the orders where necessary 
hey 
hey  where s henry 
he s with cassie and her kids
at laser tag 
you want something to drink 
i have unfiltered tap water  beer 
and some juice boxes 
i ll take a juice box 
you don t have anything on the walls 
i don t have anything to put on them
except henry s art  which is being framed 
i can give you some stuff 
you know  until you get some things 
how about that great picture of henry
on the staten island ferry 
aren t you in that one 
 i guess i    you could    cut me out 
 i m gonna have to leave a day early
to go to new york on the 22nd 
so i was wondering
if i could take henry that friday 
the 22nd  so  that s the 21st 
we have plans  actually 
we re going to  um  some thing at lacma
with the cousins 
but could you change it
so i could take him 
it s just one night 
 he s looking forward to it 
 really 
it s my night  charlie  we negotiated it 
okay  fine 
but what 
no  i m just asking you to be flexible 
i am flexible  you come in and out
and i adjust based on your schedule 
 this one night we have tickets to  
 it s not only this one night  but fine 
 henry s teacher wants to meet with us 
 you mean his la teacher 
can you  answer the e mail
so we could set a time 
yeah  i ve been distracted 
i understand 
they just want to rule out everything 
you know  with his reading 
i just think he s a little overanxious 
i think he wants it too much 
they said he s off the charts in math 
he quits too easily
when things aren t easy for him 
you know  he s like us  he s stubborn 
he s still a lousy monopoly player
because he tries to save all his money 
laughs 
laughs 
so   
i thought we should talk 
i feel like maybe things
have gone too far 
i mean  my mom s taking out a loan
against the house to help me pay nora 
i thought i paid nora 
you pay 30 percent of nora 
well  i m going broke too 
if that s any help 
i ve just agreed to direct
two shitty plays 
and we can forget putting anything away
for henry s college 
it s just that up until now  we ve been
able to keep henry somewhat removed 
and this will change that 
we have to protect him 
i agree 
nora says that the evaluator
will come into our homes 
they re going to interview henry
in addition to us 
our friends  family  enemies 
and then they ll observe us with him 
how we are as parents 
  sounds awful 
  i know 
i feel like if anybody observed me on any
given day as a mom  i d never get custody 
that was a joke 
  i know  i feel the same way 
  right 
so   
maybe we can figure
something out between us 
you remember i said this to you
at the beginning 
i know you did 
but these are different circumstances 
i was anticipating these circumstances 
anyway  shall we try this 
okay 
i don t know how to start 
do you understand
why i want to stay in la 
no 
well    that s not   
charlie  that s not a useful way
for us to start 
i don t understand it 
you don t remember promising
that we could do time here 
we discussed things 
we were married  we said things 
we talked about moving to europe 
about getting a   
sideboard  or what do you call it 
a credenza  to fill the empty space
behind the couch 
we never did any of it 
you turned down the residency
at the geffen
that would ve brought us here
for a   a year 
it wasn t something i wanted 
we had a great theater company
and a great life where we were 
 you call that a great life 
 you know what i mean 
i don t mean we had a great marriage 
i mean  life in brooklyn 
professionally 
i don t know  honestly 
i never considered anything different 
well  that s the problem  isn t it 
i mean  i was your wife 
you should ve considered my happiness too 
come on  you were happy 
you ve just decided you weren t now 
okay  okay 
let s   
m my work is here now  my family is here 
and i agreed to put henry in school here
because your show went to series 
i did that knowing that when you were done
shooting  he d come back to new york 
honey  we never said that 
that may have been your assumption 
but we never expressly said that 
  we did say it 
  when did we say it 
i don t know when we said it 
but we said it 
 i thought  
 we said it that time on the phone 
honey  let me finish  sorry 
i keep saying that 
i thought that if henry was happy here 
and my show continued 
that we might do la for a while 
i was not privy to that thought process 
the only reason we didn t live here
is because you can t imagine desires
other than your own 
unless they re forced on you 
okay  you wish you hadn t married me 
you wish you had a different life 
but this is what happened 
 so  what do we do 
 i don t know 
nora says
there s no coming back from this 
fuck nora  i hate fucking nora
telling me i always lived in la
even though i never lived in la 
how could you have her
say those things about me 
jay said them about me too 
you shouldn t have fired bert 
i needed my own asshole 
let s just both agree both of our lawyers
said shitty stuff about both of us 
nora was worse 
jay called me an alcoholic 
you pulled the rug out from under me
and you re putting me through hell 
you put me through hell
during our marriage 
is that what that was  hell 
and now you re going to put henry
through this horrible thing
 so you can yet again get what you want 
 it s not what i want 
i mean  it s what i want 
but it s what was   
was   
what s best for him 
well  i was wondering when you d
get around to henry and what he wants 
fuck off 
no  you fuck off 
if you d listen to your son  or anyone 
then he d tell you
that he d rather live here 
stop putting your feelings about me
onto henry 
he tells me he likes it better here 
he tells you because he knows
it s what you want to hear 
he tells me you re on the phone all
the time  you don t play with him 
because i m going through a divorce in la
and trying to direct a play in new york 
which closed because i wasn t there 
it was a huge opportunity for me   
you re fighting for something
you don t even want 
and i let everyone down 
you re being so much like your father 
do not compare me to my father 
i didn t compare you to him 
i said you were acting like him 
you re exactly like your mother 
everything you were complaining about her 
you re doing  you re suffocating henry 
first of all  i love my mother 
she was a wonderful mother 
 i m just repeating what you told me 
 secondly  how dare you
compare my mothering to my mother 
i may be like my father 
but i am not like my mother 
you are 
and you re like my father 
you re also like my mother 
you re all the bad things
about all of these people 
but mostly your mother 
when we would lie in bed together 
sometimes i would look at you and see her
and just feel so gross 
 i felt repulsed when you touched me 
 you re a slob 
i made all the beds 
closed all the cabinets   
the thought of having sex with you
makes me want to peel my skin off 
you ll never be happy  in la or anywhere 
you ll think you found
some better opposite guy than me 
and in a few years 
you ll rebel against him
because you need to have your voice 
but you don t want a voice 
you just want to fucking complain
about not having a voice 
i think about being married to you 
and that woman is a stranger to me 
 i mean  we had a child s marriage 
 you ve regressed 
you ve gone back to your life
before you met me  it s pathetic 
people used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist 
and i used to defend you 
they were absolutely right 
all your best acting is behind you 
you re back to being a hack 
you gaslighted me 
you re a fucking villain 
you want to present yourself as a victim
because it s a good legal strategy 
fine  but you and i both know
you chose this life 
you wanted it until you didn t 
you used me so you could get out of la 
i didn t use you 
you did  and then you blamed me for it 
you always made me aware
of what i was doing wrong 
how i was falling short 
life with you was joyless 
what  so then you had to go
and fuck someone else 
you shouldn t be upset that i fucked her 
you should be upset
that i had a laugh with her 
do you love her 
no 
but she didn t hate me  you hated me 
you hated me 
you fucked somebody we worked with 
you stopped having sex with me
in the last year 
i never cheated on you 
that was cheating on me 
but there was so much i could have done 
i was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking time out new york 
i was hot shit and i wanted
to fuck everybody and i didn t 
and i loved you
and i didn t want to lose you 
but i m in my twenties 
and i didn t want to lose that too 
and i kinda did 
and you wanted so much so fast 
i didn t even want to get married 
and fuck it 
there s so much i didn t do 
  thanks for that 
  you re welcome 
i can t believe
i have to know you forever 
you re fucking insane 
and you re fucking winning 
are you kidding me 
i wanted to be married 
i d already lost 
you didn t love me as much as i loved you 
what does that have to do with la 
what 
you re so merged
with your own selfishness 
you don t even identify it
as selfishness anymore 
you re such a dick 
every day i wake up
and i hope you re dead 
dead  like if i could guarantee
henry would be okay 
i d hope you d get an illness 
and then get hit by a car and die 
god 
i m sorry 
me too 
okay  no  we can make this nice 
um  i would take the smaller plants
and put them by the window 
and  do you have things
we can put on the walls 
all right  that s it 
thank you very much 
we miss you 
and it looks great  really 
 let us know how it goes  okay 
 all right 
i ll see you guys on  on monday 
  love you 
  all right  love you too  bye 
why do we have so many plants
all of a sudden 
we ll have to return some of that stuff 
so don t get too used to it 
i find plants kind of scary 
these plants are good guys 
hey  come here 
yeah 
tomorrow  this woman is going to come
and visit us   
and be with us while we eat dinner 
 is it your girlfriend 
 no no 
 is it mommy s boyfriend 
 no  why  does mommy have a boyfriend 
i don t know  does she 
 i don t know 
 i don t know 
why is someone watching us eat dinner 
i know  it s weird 
it s just something we have to do 
which has to do with   
mommy and me figuring out everything   
and how we re going to be 
um   
you know 
will you read to me 
sure  grab your book 
do you use drugs or alcohol 
i drink alcohol 
how much alcohol do you drink 
i don t know  a glass of wine with dinner 
  sometimes more 
  how much more 
it s    sometimes a   
a few   
i    sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone 
  okay  who do you split it with 
  i mean   
if i m having dinner with someone
and we order a bottle of wine 
  okay 
  you know  like at a restaurant 
when you say   do you want to go
by the glass or do we get a bottle  
  you get a bottle 
  well  sometimes 
i mean  sometimes i go by the glass 
you know  it depends 
did you mean drugs ever 
i have done drugs 
in college 
  anything since you ve been  
 i    i don t do it regularly 
anything since you ve been a mother 
pot a few times 
coke once at a party 
i mean  henry wasn t with me 
what would you say
are your strengths as a parent 
i listen 
i play 
i i put in the time  i   
love   
taking care of him   
watching him grow 
and sometimes   
what they say about  it goes so fast 
is true  but   
sometimes it s not 
sometimes it goes too slow  honestly 
what are your weaknesses 
i m too precise  i care too much 
are those weaknesses 
maybe not 
you know  he can be an asshole and   
i can get really pissed off 
and i ll call him on being an asshole  
i m going to stop you there 
when you do this for real 
don t ever say that 
people don t accept mothers
who drink too much wine
and yell at their child
and call him an asshole 
i get it  i do it too 
we can accept an imperfect dad 
let s face it  the idea of a good father
was only invented like 30 years ago 
before that 
fathers were expected to be silent
and absent and unreliable and selfish 
and we can all say
we want them to be different 
but on some basic level 
we accept them 
we love them for their fallibilities 
but people absolutely don t accept
those same failings in mothers 
we don t accept it structurally
and we don t accept it spiritually 
because the basis
of our judeo christian whatever
is mary  mother of jesus 
and she s perfect 
she s a virgin who gives birth 
unwaveringly supports her child
and holds his dead body when he s gone 
and the dad isn t there 
he didn t even do the fucking 
god is in heaven 
god is the father  and god didn t show up 
so  you have to be perfect  and charlie
can be a fuck up and it doesn t matter 
you will always be held
to a different  higher standard 
and it s fucked up 
but that is the way it is 
ooh  whoosh 
i think i rang the wrong bell 
nancy katz 
hi  i m charlie barber 
henry s just playing in his room 
nancy  can i get you anything

been working on the show in la

and expensive  i ll try to take him

to fly so much 
well  that can be hard on a child 
all that recycled air

  you could drive a person crazy

first you make a person hazy
  so a person could be had  
  but worse than that  
  a person that  
   titillates a person and leaves her flat

nicole 
can you help me with my zipper 
 charlie is    in   
cl    
   something 
    neat
and i re ly on him
to keep things in or der 
he is energy con    
 i don t know what this word is 
 you re getting so good at reading 
what is that 
 he doesn t look in the mirror too of ten 
he cries eas ily
in movies   
he is very self suf   
self sufficient 
 he can gar n a sock    
that means sew  like a hole 
    and cook himself dinner
and ir   
break it into two parts 
    ur  on  
not  ur  but  ire  
ire  on 
iron 
    a shirt 
he rarely gets def eated 
which i fell   
feel like i always do 
charlie takes all of my moods stead ily 
he doesn t give in to them
or make me feel bad about them 
he s a great dress er
and never looks em    
 i don t know this one 
 embarrassing 
    embarrassing 
wh ich is hard for a man  
you read it now 
 he s very competitive 
he loves being a dad 
he loves all the things
you re supposed to hate 
like the tantrums 
the waking up at night 
it s almost annoying how much he likes it 
but then  it s mostly nice 
he disappears into his own world 
he and henry are alike that way 
he can tell   
people they have food in their teeth
or on their face in a way
that doesn t make them feel bad 
charlie is self made 
his parents  i only met them once 
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol   
he moved to new york from indiana
with no safety net 
and now he s more new yorker
than any new yorker 
he s brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around 
with the theater company   
he casts a spell   
that made everyone feel included 
no one  not even an intern 
was unimportant  
what s an intern 
it s like a   
helper  but who isn t paid 
why aren t they paid 
they re young  they re learning 
i don t know  maybe if they do a good job 
they get paid later 
okay  keep going 
 he could remember all the inside jokes 
he s extremely organized and thorough 
he s very clear about what he wants 
unlike me who can t always tell 
i fell in love with him
two seconds after i saw him 
and i ll never stop loving him 
even though
it doesn t make sense anymore  
 see you  good seeing you 
 good seeing you too
