uncle pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son of a bitch alive 
and if i wanted a
partner for a killing     
     you were the worst one 
meaning the best 
on account as
you re as cold as snow     
     and don t have no
weak nerve nor fear 
pete said that 
yeah  he did 
i m a killer myself 
except

because of my youth 
schofield kid

nobody ll come clear from texas 
you sure they got that money 
women can lie  ask where the
money is  they say they got none 
but those five could have
squirreled it away  maybe 
that much

come in the house out of the sun 
sally     
     see to will s horse 
what are you doing here 
just thought i d drop in on you 
we ain t bad men no more 
we re farmers 
should be easy killing them 
if they don t go on down to texas 
how long since you fired a gun
at a man  nine  ten years 
eleven 
easy  huh 
i don t know it was
all that easy even back then 
and we were young and full of beans 
if you was mad at them     
     over some wrong 
i could see shooting them 
we done stuff for money before 
we thought we did 
what d these fellows do 
cheat at cards 
steal some strays 
spit on a rich fellow  what 
they cut up a woman 
what 
cut up her face  cut her eyes out 
cut her fingers off  cut her tits 
everything but her cunny 
i suppose 
i ll be dogged 
guess they got it coming 
of course  will     
     if claudia was alive 
you wouldn t do this 
could you look in on my youngsters
next week 
they got some hogs
they re trying to separate 
how long will you be gone 
two weeks  i guess 
what s this kid like 
three ways 
i see you still have that spencer rifle 
and i can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying 
jesus  will 
he must be moving right along 
we ll come across him
tomorrow  i reckon 
kind of got used to my bed 
this ain t going to be like no home 
that ain t the only thing i ll miss 
hell  i m sorry 
don t fret it 
it ain t nothing 
she don t like it much     
     you riding off with me 
gave me the evil eye 
you know  sally s injun     
     and injuns ain t over friendly 
i don t blame her 
i won t hold it against her 
she knew me back then 
she knew what a     
     no good son of a bitch i was 
she ain t allowing that i changed 
she don t realize i
ain t like that no more 
 you know women 
 i ain t the same  ned 
claudia straightened me up 
cleared me of drinking whiskey and all 
going on this killing     
     don t mean i ll go back
to the way i was 
just need the money 
get a new start for them youngsters 
remember that drover
i shot in the mouth     
     and his teeth came
out the back of his head 
i think about him now and again 
he didn t do anything
to deserve to get shot 
at least nothing i remembered
when i sobered up 
you was one crazy son of a bitch 
no one liked me
and the boys all thought     
     i d shoot them
out of pure meanness 
you ain t like that no more 
eagle  he hated my guts 
bonaparte didn t think too much of me 
quincy neither  i reckon 
quincy used to just watch all the time     
     scared 
like i said     
     you ain t like that no more 
that s right 
i m just a fellow now 
i ain t no different than anyone else     
     no more 
what son of a bitch shot him 
was it one of them john bulls 
no  sir  the would be assassin
is a gentleman of french ancestry 
or so it seems 
i don t wish to give offense     
     but the french are known
to be a race of assassins     
     who can t shoot worth a damn 
any frenchmen present
are excluded  of course 
says here a fellow by the name
of guiteau  g u l t  
sure as hell sounds
like a john bull to me 
again  i don t wish to give offense
when i suggest this country select     
     a king or even a queen 
rather than a president 
one isn t that quick
to shoot a king or a queen 
the majesty of royalty  you see 
maybe you don t wish to
give offense  sir     
     but you are giving it pretty thick 
this country don t need
no queens whatsoever 
 when i heard about queens  
 shut up  joe 
what s wrong with you  thirsty 
this dude  
might be that this dude
is english bob 
works for the railroad
shooting chinamen 
might be he s waiting
for some cowboy to touch his pistol     
     so he can shoot him 
is that a fact  mister 
you english bob 
pheasants 
let s shoot some pheasants 
ten shots 
at  let s say    1 a pheasant 
i ll shoot for the queen  and you     
     for whomever 
that s eight for me and one for you 
that comes to seven american dollars 
pretty damn good shooting     
     for a john bull 
no doubt your aim was
affected by your grief     
     over the injury to your president 
it s the climate that does it 
that  and the infernal distances 
does what 
induces people to shoot
persons in high places 
it s uncivilized shooting
persons of substance 
thank you 
pardon me  gentlemen 
the law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities 
proper authority 
i assure you that neither my companion
or i carry firearms on our person 
we rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man     
     and the forbearance of reptiles 
unarmed  my ass 
christ  it s hot 
if i m going to get shot 
i d rather it was hot than cold 
everything hurts me more when it s cold 
you know how if you hit your  
shut up  fatty 
clyde s back 
 with little bill 
 no 
shit 
 you clean my remington 
 cleaned and loaded 
where s little bill 
building his damn porch 
building his porch 
if you got shot 
would you want it to be hot or cold 
i ain t going to get shot 
he s coming 
of course he s coming 
i just loaded that 
i trust nobody loading my guns
if i m shooting 
what d he say 
little bill said
he was building his porch 
 you seen that thing 
 it was all loaded 
clyde  you got three pistols
and you only got one arm 
i don t want to get killed
for lack of shooting back 
he don t have a straight
angle on that whole porch 
or the whole house  for that matter 
he is the worst damn carpenter 
he didn t say nothing 
asked what they looked like 
maybe he s tough but he
sure ain t no carpenter 
maybe he ain t so tough 
seem like he was scared 
little bill  him scared 
we never seen him up
against any like these ones 
killers 
little bill come out of
kansas and texas  boys 
he worked them tough towns 
just wondered 
anybody could be scared 
he wasn t scared  boys 
he just ain t no carpenter 
there s a dignity in royalty     
     which precludes
the likelihood of assassination 
if you pointed a pistol     
     at a monarch 
your hands would shake as if palsied 
i wouldn t point no pistol at nobody 
that s a wise policy 
but if you did  i assure you 
the sight of royalty     
     would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed  you would stand     
     how should i put it     
     in awe 
a president       
why not shoot a president 
keep the change 
this strawberry alice
person  tell me again 
down the street to greely s beer
garden and billiards parlor 
say you want a game of billiards 
billiards 
even though i don t really wish to play 
no matter  they burned the
table in  78 for firewood 
quite right 
mr  beauchamp 
i think a cup of tea  
hello  bob 
boys  this here is english bob 
shit and fried eggs 
been a long time 
run out of chinamen 
i thought that you were dead 
you ve shaved your chin whiskers off 
i was tasting the soup
two hours after i ate it 
actually  what i heard was you     
     fell off your horse 
drunk  of course 
and that you broke your bloody neck 
i heard that one myself  bob 
hell  i even thought i was dead 
till i found out i was just in nebraska

i write 
letters 
books  bill  books 
actually     
     he s my biographer 
i wouldn t do that if i were you 
it s only a book 
a book 
that means you boys can read 
that means you saw the signs outside
town saying surrender your firearms 
but like you told young andy     
     you re not armed  are you 
not really  bill 
got a peacemaker  but that
wouldn t worry you  would it 
if you don t see it 
or better  if you don t hear it 
i m afraid so  bob 
i don t like firearms around 
be very careful with it  sonny 
see what kind of books
mr  beauchamp is packing 
make sure you don t get wet 
no shit 
all he s got is writing
stuff and this book

 chased that horse a damn mile 
 what was you shooting at us for 
 i thought you was following me 
 we was 
 you said if i changed my mind  
 wasn t nothing said about no partner 
this here s ned logan 
he s the schofield kid 
nephew to pete sothow 
i seen two fellows following me 
my guess is you come to kill me 
we never talked about no other fellow 
there s two cowboys  better there s
three of us  if they got friends 
i can take care of them two myself 
it don t take three 
ned s an awful good shot with a rifle 
hit a bird in the eye flying 
better than you  anyhow 
you wasn t even close 
get your damn hands off my rifle 
thought i d check it for you 
maybe something s bent 
it ain t bent 
you were shooting all over creation 
you ll share your half with him 
i figure three ways 
you figured wrong 
sorry i wasted your time  ned 
you going back with him 
he s my partner 
he don t go  i don t go 
what s it come to  three ways 
shit 
what are you pissing on about 
 what are you looking at  anyhow 
   looking at   
clouds  kid 
looking at them on account of
we got a storm riding up our ass 
hell  i seen them 
you was smart to change your mind 
i m a real good shot with this rifle 
see that hawk 
i could hit it with one shot 
hell  i could hit it too 
if i didn t mind wasting a shot 
there ain t no hawk  kid 
you can t see for shit  can you 
see your canteen 
how far can you see 
 far enough 
 we ain t shooting canteens  how far 
 100 yards 
 more 
 see that scrub oak tree yonder 
 fuck you 
 he s blind 
 i ain t 
asshole 
hold it 
how far can you see  kid 
50 yards 
you bet your ass
i can see 50 yards  will 
i can see well enough
to shoot this son of a bitch 
hold on 
hear that  ned 
kid can see 50 yards  fine 
jesus 
50 yards ll do just fine 
now let s move out 
they look like real hard cases  bob 
did you kill all seven of them 
or just wing some of them 
that you here embalmed on the cover 
  the duck of death   
it s the duke 
  duke of death    
you always were the hell in jesus
with a pistol  but seven of them 
protecting that woman 
how do you do that 
it s desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain     
     liberty when depicting
the cover scene 
for reasons involving the marketplace  
 from what i read  the writing s not
that much different than the picture 
i can assure you  mr  daggett     
     that the events described are
from eyewitness accounts 
eyewitnesses 
like the duck himself  i guess 
the duke 
duck  i says 
   you have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman  corcoran      
     said the duck 
 you must apologize  
but two gun corcoran
would have none of it 
cursing  he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him     
     but the duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking six guns    
i consider that an accurate
depiction of events 
there is a certain poetry to the
language which i couldn t resist 
i was in the blue bottle
saloon in wichita     
     the night english bob
killed corky corcoran 
i didn t see you there 
nor no woman 
nor two gun shooters 
 nor none of this 
 you were there 
yeah  i was there 
first off     
     corky never carried two guns 
though he should have 
he was called two gun corcoran 
a lot of folks did call him two gun 
but not because he had two pistols 
it was because his dick     
     was longer than the barrel
on his walker colt 
only insulting he did was stick it
into a french lady     
     that he was sweet on 
when corky walked into the blue bottle
and before he knew what s what     
     bob takes a shot at him 
and misses  he s so damn drunk 
that bullet whizzing by panicked
corky  he did the wrong thing 
he hurried
and shot his damn toe off 
meantime  bob here     
     aims real good
and squeezes off another     
     but he misses  he s still so drunk 
hits a   1 000 mirror over the bar 
the duck of death is as good as dead     
     because corky does it right 
he aims real careful 
 no hurry 
 and 
that walker colt blew up in his hand 
a failing common to that model 
if corky d had two guns instead of
a big dick  he would ve been there     
     to defend himself to the end 
wait a minute 
english bob killed him when
he didn t even have       
bob wasn t going to wait
for corky to grow a new hand 
no  he just
walked over there real slow     
     because he was drunk     
     and shot him
through the liver 
don t like rocks
on my dadgum back 
 i sure do miss my bed 
 you said that last night 
last night i said i missed my wife 
tonight i just miss my dadgum bed 
you ll miss your dadgum roof next 
i suppose 
shit 
that business
up in jackson county     
     that really happen 
the way they say it happened 
what business 
there s two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you 
got you dead to rights 
you pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell 
only took a scratch yourself 
uncle pete never seen nothing like it     
     shooting your way out
of that scrape 
i don t recollect 
you don t recollect 
right 
ned     
     how many men you killed 
aren t you going to answer 
what the hell s that to you 
to know the kind of fellow i m riding
with  in case we get into a scrape 
how many men you killed  kid 
five
