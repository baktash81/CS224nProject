women can lie ask where the
money is they say they got none
but those five could have

sally

just thought id drop in on you
we aint bad men no more
were farmers
should be easy killing them
if they dont go on down to texas
how long since you fired a gun
at a man nine ten years
eleven
easy huh
i dont know it was
all that easy even back then
and we were young and full of beans
if you was mad at them
over some wrong
i could see shooting them
we done stuff for money before
we thought we did
whatd these fellows do
cheat at cards
steal some strays
spit on a rich fellow what
they cut up a woman
what
cut up her face cut her eyes out
cut her fingers off cut her tits
everything but her cunny
i suppose
ill be dogged
guess they got it coming
of course will
if claudia was alive
you wouldnt do this
could you look in on my youngsters
next week
they got some hogs
theyre trying to separate
how long will you be gone
two weeks i guess
whats this kid like
three ways
i see you still have that spencer rifle
and i can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying
jesus will
he must be moving right along
well come across him
tomorrow i reckon
kind of got used to my bed
this aint going to be like no home
that aint the only thing ill miss
hell im sorry
dont fret it
it aint nothing
she dont like it much
you riding off with me
gave me the evil eye
you know sallys injun
and injuns aint overfriendly
i dont blame her
i wont hold it against her
she knew me back then
she knew what a
nogood son of a bitch i was
she aint allowing that i changed
she dont realize i
aint like that no more
you know women
i aint the same ned
claudia straightened me up
cleared me of drinking whiskey and all
going on this killing
dont mean ill go back
to the way i was
just need the money
get a new start for them youngsters
remember that drover
i shot in the mouth
and his teeth came
out the back of his head
i think about him now and again
he didnt do anything
to deserve to get shot
at least nothing i remembered
when i sobered up
you was one crazy son of a bitch
no one liked me
and the boys all thought
id shoot them
out of pure meanness
you aint like that no more
eagle he hated my guts
bonaparte didnt think too much of me
quincy neither i reckon
quincy used to just watch all the time
scared
like i said
you aint like that no more
thats right
im just a fellow now
i aint no different than anyone else
no more
what son of a bitch shot him
was it one of them john bulls
no sir the wouldbe assassin
is a gentleman of french ancestry
or so it seems
i dont wish to give offense
but the french are known
to be a race of assassins
who cant shoot worth a damn
any frenchmen present
are excluded of course
says here a fellow by the name
of guiteau gult
sure as hell sounds
like a john bull to me
again i dont wish to give offense
when i suggest this country select
a king or even a queen
rather than a president
one isnt that quick
to shoot a king or a queen
the majesty of royalty you see
maybe you dont wish to
give offense sir
but you are giving it pretty thick
this country dont need
no queens whatsoever
when i heard about queens
shut up joe
whats wrong with you thirsty
this dude
might be that this dude
is english bob
works for the railroad
shooting chinamen
might be hes waiting
for some cowboy to touch his pistol
so he can shoot him
is that a fact mister
you english bob
pheasants
lets shoot some pheasants
ten shots
at lets say  1 a pheasant
ill shoot for the queen and you
for whomever
thats eight for me and one for you
that comes to seven american dollars
pretty damn good shooting
for a john bull
no doubt your aim was
affected by your grief
over the injury to your president
its the climate that does it
that and the infernal distances
does what
induces people to shoot
persons in high places
its uncivilized shooting
persons of substance
thank you
pardon me gentlemen
the law obliges you to surrender
sidearms to the proper authorities
proper authority
i assure you that neither my companion
or i carry firearms on our person
we rely upon the goodwill
of our fellow man
and the forbearance of reptiles
unarmed my ass
christ its hot
if im going to get shot
id rather it was hot than cold
everything hurts me more when its cold
you know how if you hit your
shut up fatty
clydes back
with little bill
no
shit
you clean my remington
cleaned and loaded
wheres little bill
building his damn porch
building his porch
if you got shot
would you want it to be hot or cold
i aint going to get shot
hes coming
of course hes coming
i just loaded that
i trust nobody loading my guns
if im shooting
whatd he say
little bill said
he was building his porch
you seen that thing
it was all loaded
clyde you got three pistols
and you only got one arm
i dont want to get killed
for lack of shooting back
he dont have a straight
angle on that whole porch
or the whole house for that matter
he is the worst damn carpenter
he didnt say nothing
asked what they looked like
maybe hes tough but he
sure aint no carpenter
maybe he aint so tough
seem like he was scared
little bill him scared
we never seen him up
against any like these ones
killers
little bill come out of
kansas and texas boys
he worked them tough towns
just wondered
anybody could be scared
he wasnt scared boys
he just aint no carpenter
theres a dignity in royalty
which precludes
the likelihood of assassination
if you pointed a pistol
at a monarch
your hands would shake as if palsied
i wouldnt point no pistol at nobody
thats a wise policy
but if you did i assure you
the sight of royalty
would cause you to dismiss thoughts
of bloodshed you would stand
how should i put it
in awe
a president
why not shoot a president
keep the change
this strawberry alice
person tell me again
down the street to greelys beer
garden and billiards parlor
say you want a game of billiards
billiards
even though i dont really wish to play
no matter they burned the
table in 78 for firewood
quite right
mr beauchamp
i think a cup of tea
hello bob
boys this here is english bob
shit and fried eggs
been a long time
run out of chinamen
i thought that you were dead
youve shaved your chin whiskers off
i was tasting the soup
two hours after i ate it

i wouldnt do that if i were you
its only a book
a book
that means you boys can read
that means you saw the signs outside
town saying surrender your firearms
but like you told young andy
youre not armed are you
not really bill
got a peacemaker but that
wouldnt worry you would it
if you dont see it
or better if you dont hear it
im afraid so bob

a man like me
only woman i could get is

chased that horse a damn mile
what was you shooting at us for
i thought you was following me
we was
you said if i changed my mind
wasnt nothing said about no partner
this heres ned logan
hes the schofield kid
nephew to pete sothow
i seen two fellows following me
my guess is you come to kill me
we never talked about no other fellow
theres two cowboys better theres
three of us if they got friends
i can take care of them two myself
it dont take three
neds an awful good shot with a rifle
hit a bird in the eye flying
better than you anyhow
you wasnt even close
get your damn hands off my rifle
thought id check it for you
maybe somethings bent
it aint bent
you were shooting all over creation
youll share your half with him
i figure three ways
you figured wrong
sorry i wasted your time ned
you going back with him
hes my partner
he dont go i dont go
whats it come to three ways
shit
what are you pissing on about
what are you looking at anyhow
looking at
clouds kid
looking at them on account of
we got a storm riding up our ass
hell i seen them
you was smart to change your mind
im a real good shot with this rifle
see that hawk
i could hit it with one shot
hell i could hit it too
if i didnt mind wasting a shot
there aint no hawk kid
you cant see for shit can you
see your canteen
how far can you see
far enough
we aint shooting canteens how far
100 yards
more
see that scrub oak tree yonder
fuck you
hes blind
i aint
asshole
hold it
how far can you see kid
50 yards
you bet your ass
i can see 50 yards will
i can see well enough
to shoot this son of a bitch
hold on
hear that ned
kid can see 50 yards fine
jesus
50 yardsll do just fine
now lets move out
they look like real hard cases bob
did you kill all seven of them
or just wing some of them
that you here embalmed on the cover
the duck of death
its the duke
duke of death
you always were the hell in jesus
with a pistol but seven of them
protecting that woman
how do you do that
its desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain
liberty when depicting
the cover scene
for reasons involving the marketplace
from what i read the writings not
that much different than the picture
i can assure you mr daggett
that the events described are
from eyewitness accounts
eyewitnesses
like the duck himself i guess
the duke
duck i says
you have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman corcoran
said the duck
you must apologize
but twogun corcoran
would have none of it
cursing he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him
but the duck was faster and hot lead
blazed from his smoking sixguns
i consider that an accurate
depiction of events
there is a certain poetry to the
language which i couldnt resist
i was in the blue bottle
saloon in wichita
the night english bob
killed corky corcoran
i didnt see you there
nor no woman
nor twogun shooters
nor none of this
you were there
yeah i was there
first off
corky never carried two guns
though he should have
he was called twogun corcoran
a lot of folks did call him twogun
but not because he had two pistols
it was because his dick
was longer than the barrel
on his walker colt
only insulting he did was stick it
into a french lady
that he was sweet on
when corky walked into the blue bottle
and before he knew whats what
bob takes a shot at him
and misses hes so damn drunk
that bullet whizzing by panicked
corky he did the wrong thing
he hurried
and shot his damn toe off
meantime bob here
aims real good
and squeezes off another
but he misses hes still so drunk
hits a  1000 mirror over the bar
the duck of death is as good as dead
because corky does it right
he aims real careful
no hurry
and
that walker colt blew up in his hand
a failing common to that model
if corkyd had two guns instead of
a big dick he wouldve been there
to defend himself to the end
wait a minute
english bob killed him when
he didnt even have
bob wasnt going to wait
for corky to grow a new hand
no he just
walked over there real slow
because he was drunk
and shot him
through the liver
dont like rocks
on my dadgum back
i sure do miss my bed
you said that last night
last night i said i missed my wife
tonight i just miss my dadgum bed
youll miss your dadgum roof next
i suppose
shit
that business
up in jackson county
that really happen
the way they say it happened
what business
theres two deputies up close
pointing their rifles right at you
got you dead to rights
you pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell
only took a scratch yourself
uncle pete never seen nothing like it
shooting your way out
of that scrape
i dont recollect
you dont recollect
right
ned
how many men you killed
arent you going to answer
what the hells that to you
to know the kind of fellow im riding
with in case we get into a scrape
how many men you killed kid
five
