meeting by reminding you that hanks
original idea was a comparative study of
the great cuts of the world and while
preserving the african cuts in the
natural habitat he was read several
parts of each species with the african
or otherwise and to become almost like a
member of the brain hey it has stripes
it must be another tiger or like the
mother is a wireless the father must be
a tiger so you want henry the jaguar
would you not today what are you trying
to prove that you can have line
socializing with people no but we can t
keep exterminating them we can t keep
eliminating their land
you can t keep exterminating everything
that we fear that inconveniences us let
the stools get them alive finish your
actions aren t necessary the government
knows there s a better way they re
moving the people out of the migration
