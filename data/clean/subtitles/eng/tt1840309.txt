they say the war was terrible
that the rest of the world was destroyed
our founders built the wall
to keep us safe
and they divided us into
five groups factions
to keep the peace
the smart ones
the ones who value knowledge and logic
are in erudite
they know everything
amity farm the land
theyre all about
kindness and harmony always happy
candor value honesty and order
they tell the truth
even when you wish they wouldnt
and then theres dauntless
theyre our protectors
our soldiers our police
i always thought they were amazing
brave fearless and free
some people think dauntless are crazy
which they kind of are
come on beatrice
my faction is abnegation
the others all call us stiffs
we lead a simple life
selfless dedicated to helping others
we even feed the factionless
the ones who dont fit in anywhere
because were public servants
were trusted to run the government
my father works alongside
our leader marcus
it all works
everyone knows where they belong
except for me
my mother says
theres an art to losing yourself
but i havent figured it out yet
im supposed to never think of myself
to always help others
to never look too long in the mirror
are you nervous
no
were you for your test
mmmmmm no
i was terrified
but i didnt have any reason to be
and neither do you
thats all you get
rules are rules
today i take the test
im scared itll tell me
im not abnegation
that i have to leave my family
but im even more scared
that it will tell me to stay
for my brother caleb its easy
let me help you with that
hes a natural
beatrice do you wanna get the other bags
sorry
what if shed been blind
or an amputee
would you have helped her then
i was thinking about helping her
its not that hard
for you maybe
just relax beatrice
take a deep breath and trust the test
trust the test
test will tell me who i am
where i belong
am i smart
kind
am i honest
selfless
or brave
hey so all the food
that were not getting
you guys are giving away
to the factionless
right yeah
yeah
youre a liar
why are you lying to me
everybody knows you keep it for yourselves
so why dont you just admit it
huh
im talking to you
are all you stiffs deaf or somethin hey
beatrice
dont
one hundred years ago after the war
our founders created a system
they believed would prevent future conflict
and create lasting peace
today aptitude testing
based on your personality
will assign you to one of the factions
while it is our belief
that choosing the faction
indicated by your test
is the best way to ensure
success within the faction system
it is your right tomorrow
at the choosing ceremony
to choose any of the five factions
regardless of your test results
however once the choice has been made
there will be no change permitted
what is it with you abnegation and mirrors
we reject vanity
yeah i know sit down
im tori
ill be administering your test
youll be offered a series of choices
to test your aptitude for each faction
until you get one result
i wouldnt sweat it
95 get the faction of their origin
and from the looks of you
what is it
bottoms up
choose
now before its too late
why what will i do with them
choose
just tell me
puppy
get up
were going out the back door
before a supervisor comes
but what was my result
come on
what happened
youre going to tell your family
that the serum made you sick
and that i sent you home
all right
no but what was my result
abnegation
and erudite
and dauntless
dauntless
your results were inconclusive
thats impossible
it doesnt make any sense
no not impossible
its just extremely rare
they call it divergent
you cant tell anyone about this
not even your parents
as far as the world is concerned
you received an abnegation result
because that is what i manually entered
so what am i supposed to do
at the choosing ceremony
i was supposed to learn what to do
this was supposed to tell me
what faction to choose the test
were supposed to trust the test
the test didnt work on you
you have to trust yourself
what happened to you today
where did you go after your test
i got sick
so they sent me home early
did you finish your test
mmmhmm
what was your result
what was yours
why did you just leave
without telling anybody
i was sick
beatrice
i dont think you understand
the level of scrutiny were under
theyre doing everything they can
to discredit us right now
who is
erudite
they believe that they should be
the governing faction not us
so you have to be careful right now okay
even marcus is under attack
for what
its an old accusation
that he mistreated his son
and thats why the boy defected
is that true
no
course not
children defect for all kinds of reasons
dont take too long in here
you need a good nights sleep
for tomorrow
i um
we love you
good night
im so proud of you honey
beatrice
what
tomorrow when we choose
you have to think of the family
yeah
but you also have to think of yourself
factions please gather
in your assigned areas
morning jeanine
good morning andrew
how is marcus holding up
as well as can be expected
we need to find out
whos behind these rumors
i think we all know who it is
if its someone from erudite
i promise ill find out who
these are your children
i dont think i knew
they were choosing today
whats your name
im im caleb
its a pleasure to meet you
jeanine matthews
and you are
this is beatrice
well you both have a big decision
to make today
im sure your parents will support
whatever choice you make
thats not supposed to be a choice
the test should tell us what to do
youre still free to choose
but you dont really want that
beatrice
i want you to choose
who you truly are
and where you truly belong
not on a whim not because you
wish you were someone youre not
but because you honestly know yourself
i want you to choose wisely
and i know you will
the faction system is a living being
composed of cells all of you
and the only way it can survive and thrive
is for each of you to claim
your rightful place
the future belongs to those
who know where they belong
when we leave this room
you will no longer be dependents
but fullfledged members of our society
faction before blood
faction before blood
i love you
no matter what

nice legs stiff
hey
how you doin
shall we sit there
have you never seen
a hamburger before
no ive seen one
i just have never eaten one
abnegation eat plain food
plantbased diet with no sauces
and a minimum of seasoning
which textbook did you swallow
nice to meet you too
im will erudite
of course you are
no offense but im surprised
abnegation even eats at all
too selfish right
no wonder you left
you gotta be pretty selfconfident
to be friends with a candor
what is that supposed to mean
you have no filter
you say the first thing
that comes into your head
you mean like
youre an idiot
nice one al
at least we tell the truth
erudite can tell the truth
because we have the facts
i dont want to hear
about your old factions
youre dauntless now
were you a transfer too
or dauntlessborn
are you kidding
no
what makes you think
you can talk to me
it
must be because youre so approachable
careful
four
you my friend have a death wish
you know
he was first in his class
they tried to recruit him
for leadership twice
but he said no
initiates stand
you have chosen to join the warrior faction
tasked with the defense of this city
and all its inhabitants
we believe in ordinary acts of bravery
and the courage that drives one person
to stand up for another
respect that
do us proud
whoa
i want everyone in the pit
two minutes
there are two stages of training
the first is physical
push your bodies to the breaking point
and youll master the methods of combat
the second is mental
again breaking point
youll face your worst fears and conquer
them unless they get you first
youll be trained separately
from the dauntlessborn
but youll be ranked together
after initiations rankings will determine
what jobs you move into
leadership guarding the fence
or keeping the factionless
from killing each other
the rankings will also
determine who gets cut
cut
at the end of each stage of training
the lowestranking initiates will be leaving us
to do what
theres no going home to your families
so youd live factionless
why didnt we know that
its a new rule
a new rule
somebody should have told us that
why
would you have chosen differently
out of fear
i mean if thats the case
you might as well get out now
if youre really one of us
it wont matter to you that you might fail
now you chose us
now we get to choose you
statistically speaking you should have
hit the target at least once by now
even by accident
hey what have you got
factionless not doing anything
check it out stiff
thats gonna be your new family
go say hi
you ready for some real fighting
not even close
first jumper
in the ring
last jumper
time to fight
how long do we fight for
till one of you cant continue
or one of you concedes
according to the old rules
new rules no one concedes
you really want to lose
em on their first fight
a brave man never surrenders
lucky for you those werent
the rules when we fought
youll be scored on this
so fight hard
go
dont be scared stiff
nice tris
nice
yeah
all right guys over here
listen up
know what this board is
its your life
we grade you every day
if youre still in the red by
the end of the first stage
youre out
im never gonna make it
yes you are
im the weakest one here
then youll be most improved
youre candor
youre not supposed to lie
i was candor
and im not lying
if they cut me i think my parents
would take me back
no it doesnt
work like that
even if they wanted to
their faction wouldnt allow it
even if my parents would take me back
i wouldnt belong there anymore
this is getting depressing
yeah
you know
what we should do get tattoos
did you know they had
a tattoo of your face
like it
yeah
where would you get it
i dont know
where do you suggest
anywhere you want
here its this thing here
you remember me right
i was just wondering
if you could
no
i just do tattoos
okay
id like this one
please
can i just ask you
you made a mistake
choosing dauntless
theyll find out about you
who
who will
the people youre a threat to
what people who dauntless
no society
if you dont fit into a category
they cant control you
i dont get it
im dauntless
im going to be dauntless
i chose dauntless
for your sake i hope so
youre weak
you have no muscle
youre never gonna win not like that
thats good to know
yeah you have to use your whole body
keep tension here
okay
and go on offense
youre fast so you could win
if you attack first
you get inside
you jab to the throat
four
keep working
sorry about that will
come on chris
stop stop
im done im done
you need to stop
okay
let me give you a hand
thanks
all right
lets everyone take a break
you feelin a little better
yeah im fine
whoa
grab the rail
or dont
youve got three options
hang there
and ill forget your cowardice
fall and die
or give up
but if you give up youre out
come on chris
time
dauntless never give up
as dauntless we fight to protect
every life inside the fence without fail
thats why we train you the way we do
to teach you not to give up
and to find out who has what it takes
even though its been quiet
out there for years
that could change at any moment
so we have to be ready for everything
whoo
whats out there
monsters
amity farms
no i know but beyond that
places that never recovered
from the war
do you know
lets just say they built
their fence for a reason
man
youre kinda good at this
come on
that was pathetic
it slipped
well go get it
what while theyre throwing
are you afraid
of getting stabbed
by an airborne knife yeah
everybody stop
stand in front of the target
four gimme a hand here
youre gonna stand there
while he throws those knives
and if i see you flinch youre out
one thing you will learn here
is that orders are not optional
stop
anyone can stand in front of a target
it doesnt prove anything
then it should be easy
for you to take his place
same rules apply
oh come on four
you can get closer than that
you want me to give her a little trim
yeah maybe just a little off the top
points for bravery stiff
not as many as you just lost
for opening your mouth
now watch yourself
we train soldiers not rebels
but were done for today
get out
you all right
you cut me
i meant to
you meant to
you think he was gonna
let you off without a scratch
youd still be standing there
if i hadnt hit you
so am i supposed
to thank you
youre supposed to be smart
if i wanted to hurt you
i would have
there she is
you do have a death wish
i cant believe you said that to eric
youre the only one
whos ever stood up to him
look at your ear
lets get you cleaned up
hey tris
that was cool
thanks
impressive stiff congrats
shut up
what
hey youre famous now
i mean not because
of the thing with eric
youre in the news
yeah listen
the recent transfers
of beatrice and caleb prior
children of andrew prior
call into question the soundness
of abnegations teachings and values
what prompted them to leave
perhaps the answer lies in the
corrupted ideal of an entire faction
the theft of resources
the general incompetence
the abuse of their children
did they beat you
like marcus eatons kid
they didnt beat anyone
theyre good people
right
and thats why you left
was it something i said
hes an idiot
yeah
yeah thats okay
whats she doing at dauntless
prior
youre andrew priors daughter arent you
beatrice
its just tris now
tris i like that
hmm
you made an impressive choice
tris despite your parents
and your test result
youve seen my test result
of course
im glad you were smart enough
to know your own mind
let me know if you ever need anything
well that was weird
yeah
what do you think is goin on
i bet theyre hunting divergents
thats all they talk about
at erudite these days
wait
divergents are real
come on al
first fight peter versus tris
what
uhoh

a real gunshot wound

oh picking the weak ones
so youve got someone
to blame when you lose
something like that
where did erics team go
they must have gone to the end
all right lights off
gather around come on
okay whats your strategy
we can hide the flag well enough
so they cant find it
lets send out a team to scout their location
see if we can find their flag
i say we blitz them
just beat them with sheer force
yeah thats the best
way to lose quickly
end this quickly
they wont expect it
we dont know where they are
okay we split into two groups
defense and offense
who put you in charge
someone has
to make a decision
we need to be more aggressive
we need to be smart about it
youre not gonna jump are you
no im just trying to get
a good vantage point
good thinking
you dont have to come with me
you should go easy
you took a beating
im surprised you noticed
i saw you leave during the fight

glamorous
mom
oh my girl
mom what are you doing here
i knew theyd assign you
here sooner or later
look at you
god youre so strong and beautiful
mom you cant be here
i know but youre in danger
what
i had to ask you something
you werent sick the day you took
your aptitude test were you
why
what were your test results
honey its okay
you can tell me
they were
they were inconclusive
divergent
you cant tell anyone
you cant tell your friends
your instructors
you cant trust anyone
im not
people have always been
so threatened by divergents
but now erudite is looking
for them everywhere
theyre actively seeking them out
why
mom what am i
you dont conform
your mind works in a million different ways
theyre scared of you
stage two of training is where
you are most at risk
theyre gonna get inside your head
and watch how you respond to fear
but you can pass
you can make it through dauntless
i have seen it before
how do you know so much about this
about dauntless
never mind about me
do not let them know who you are
wait
wait were you dauntless
listen
hey
what are you doing
trucks loaded lets go
what did they do to her
tris
take a seat
im going to inject you
with a serum that stimulates
the part of your brain
that processes fear
great
it induces a hallucination
and then transmitters in the serum
allow me to see the images
in your mind
you can see inside my mind
mmmhmm
lay back
now youre gonna be facing
your worst fears tris
most people have 10 to 15 really bad ones
you have to calm yourself
slow your heart rate and your breathing
and deal with whats in front of you
be brave
this isnt real
its all right
its all right
you okay
how long do you think you were
in the hallucination tris
twenty minutes
three
four times faster
than the average
ive never seen anyone
do that well the first time
how did you get rid of the birds
the image wasnt clear
um
i just went into the water
well next time itll be a lot easier
i have to do that again
yeah you have to practice
several times before the final
but youre a natural
you got nothing to worry about
my whole body
was covered in these little insects
they were in my ears and my throat
i couldnt breathe
yeah i heard about this guy
like two years ago
so panicked he had
a heart attack in his chair
and he almost died
what
yeah so weve got that
to look forward to right
you didnt seem to have any problem at all
me no no my god
it was awful
oh come on
no one even came close to your time
you were amazing
yeah whats amazing is that
shes gonna knock you right out
of dauntless
shes not gonna knock me out
of dauntless
look shes gone from being the worst
to one of the best
somebodys gotta take her place
at the bottom
whos it gonna be you
do you ever stop talking
i just want to know how she does it
whats your trick
i dont have a trick
nobody gets through it that fast
why dont you tell us
how you do it
at least tell your friends
whats he talkin about
is there some way to make it easier
no
no i
im not doing anything
hey hey
this isnt real
howd you do that
what
howd you break the glass
i dont know just did it
you just did it
what were your test results
your aptitude test
abnegation
i dont think so
what
i think youre lying to me
why would i lie to you
im gonna ask you one more time
what were your test results
abnegation
time for you to go
tris
just so you know
dauntless dont break the glass like that
my brother was like you
during the second stage
he got good really fast
last day of the simulations
one of the dauntless leaders
came to watch him
then the next morning
we found his body
at the bottom of the chasm
they got rid of him
who did
dauntless leadership
you cant let them find out about you
and what if they already know
then youre already dead
beatrice
what are you doing here
im in trouble
what happened
im not gonna make it at dauntless
i dont fit in there
you have to fit in there
i cant
im just
im not like them
i mean who is
theyre crazy
maybe i can go back to abnegation
you cant go back
i know but
theyre never gonna
let you do that
who
erudite
theyre not gonna let abnegation
break any more rules
they actually think that
theyre running the government now
they might be soon
wait really
erudite should be in charge
certainly not abnegation
wait hold on caleb
how can you say that
its what all the other factions want
now that abnegation failed
no thats just what
theyre telling you here
its true
its not true
its not
there are liars here
there are people who know
how to manipulate you
you need to understand that
beatrice
i think you should go
faction before blood yeah
got it
i need you to come with me
stop
are you all right
yeah im fine
please sit down
thank you
im glad you came here today
you are
are you happy with your new faction
yeah
but you came to see your brother
i just
i just wanted to talk to him
have you seen your parents
no
its hard to let go
faction before blood
its an important ideal
but sometimes difficult to fulfill
it goes against
our fundamental human nature
but thats exactly the weakness
we need to overcome
you think that human nature is a weakness
i think human nature is the enemy
its human nature
to keep secrets lie steal
and i wanna eradicate that
thats how well maintain
a stable peaceful society
you would help me with that wouldnt you
how would i help you
youre aware that abnegation is undermining
the faction system and breaking laws
harboring divergents
i didnt know that
but if thats true
then im glad that i left
see i need to know
that i can count on you
to enforce the law
even if its been broken
by someone close to you
someone you care about
of course
good
then ill have my car
take you back to dauntless
come on get her over
come on do it do it
hey
you all right
yeah
come on lets go
here put this on
thank you
youll be safe here
sorry
its okay
i cant believe al
youre moving up through the ranks
and hes failing
it makes him hate himself
and it makes him hate you
hes just afraid
everyones afraid
i know but fear does something strange
to people like al
but not you
fear doesnt shut you down
it wakes you up
ive seen it
you should lie down
get some sleep
yeah
ill take the floor
how you feeling
better
good
whered you go yesterday
to see my brother
its getting a little boring
for you here is it
my brother said that
he thinks erudite is planning
to overthrow abnegation
do you think they could do that
yeah i do
i think its possible
depends how far theyre willing to go
im worried about my parents
yeah
but i think you got other things
you need to worry about
dont you
yeah
i should go
hi
hey
is that your sweater
no
so what happened
to you last night
tris can i talk
to you for a second
listen i just wanted
to say that im sorry
i dont know whats wrong with me
please can you ever forgive me
if you ever come close to me again
i will kill you
tris
you need to stay away from me
you are a coward
i just cant believe he would do that
its not like him at all
whats that
come on
oh my god
guess he just jumped
tris
tris
leave me alone
im sorry about al
its my fault that hes dead
no its not because of you
he made his own choice
he would have been factionless
he was not gonna pass that final test
neither am i
why do you say that
you know why
and as soon as all the others find out
theyre gonna kill me
im not gonna let that happen
shut the door
youre gonna practice
in my fear landscape
no
in mine
we go in together
have you ever done this before
no i havent
you sure you want to
why wouldnt i
i dont know
you havent told me anything about yourself
and now youre just gonna
let me inside of your head
are you afraid of that
youre not
no
fear of heights
im not surprised
its not real
we could just jump
no
divergent would jump
dauntless would get to that building
if you want to pass
if you want to avoid discovery
you have to do everything
the way a dauntless would do it
you have to find some tool
some method to survive
fear of confinement
you have to find a way of stopping it
what would a dauntless do
good
take your time
im just enjoying myself
in this shrinking box
as a dauntless soldier
you have to follow orders
you dont always agree with
who is she
shes an innocent
i have to kill her
but i can never do it
unless i look away
why are we in abnegation
your last fear is your worst fear
it lives in the deepest part of your mind
marcus had a son
what was his name
tobias
tobias
tobias
tobias
tobias
im just trying to help you to be better
no
four
four fears
four then four now
i keep going in there
but i dont think you ever lose them
can i ask you something
sure
whats your tattoo
you wanna see it
its amazing
the factions
why do you have all of them
i dont want to be just one thing
i cant be
i want to be brave and
i want to be selfless
intelligent and honest and kind
although im still working on kind
i dont wanna go too fast
its okay
ive already got my spot on the floor
morning
hey
come on
im gonna show you something
okay
look
erudite
yeah
theyre here every morning
ive been watching them for weeks
what are they doing at dauntless
loading in supplies
computers
and these
what is it
i think its some kind
of cognitive transmitter
you inject it like a serum
why
its supposed
to make you more susceptible to suggestion
but as many as they have
they could create an army
attention
all initiates report for final testing
all initiates report for final testing
youre ready
you can do this
they can see
your hallucinations on the screen
so you get past your fears
the way a dauntless would
but do it quickly
right if im too good
then theyll kill me
and if im too slow then ill die
right
good luck
good luck tris
hope you make it
congratulations
whoa four
stop four
arent you dauntless
please tell me that
you werent watching that
would you feel better if i said no

all abnegation will be questioned
the legendary four
a mindless drone
you were first in your class
now youre
nothing
what
think he might be
theres one way to find out
say goodbye asshole
goodbye
move and you die
the stiff
two stiffs
two dead stiffs
you cant let a single
divergent slip through
this is what happens
shes not gonna shoot me
think you might be overestimating
my character
run
you were hit
yeah
right there dont move
drop your weapons
tobias eaton
and you beatrice
i thought it was intellect
i was sensing in you
maybe youre not as smart
as you think you are
why are you attacking
all these innocent people
innocent people
abnegation if left unchecked
will destroy the faction system
same can be said of both of you
somebody has to stop you
if we dont peace will be lost
its already been lost
you destroyed it
human nature destroyed it
those of us with the vision to see that
are called upon to protect the rest
we will restore the peace
and this time it will last
and what if youre wrong
bring him with us
shes injured
any results would be unclear
you can get rid of her
all right

then it wasnt in vain
we need to leave here
are there soldiers outside
no its clear
i should have believed you
i left as soon as i realized
why is this happening
i dont understand
why are dauntless fighting for erudite
they dont know what theyre doing
theyre under simulation
we need to wake em up
i need to get into dauntless
thats a fortress
its not gonna happen
i can get us in there
get ready
what now
youre not gonna like it
theres a net at the bottom
dont think just jump
are you good
good
lets go
wait here
against the wall
against the wall
how are you awake
because im smarter than you
and they need me
where are they controlling it from
why would i tell you that
its not like youre gonna shoot me
why do people keep saying that
where are they controlling it from
did you really need to shoot him
every minute we waste
another abnegation dies
and another dauntless
becomes a murderer
peter lets go
thats it isnt it
yeah
ive seen jeanine go in there
thats where shes controlling it from
like you said
there isnt a second to waste
dad no
dad
hey
watch caleb
im going in there
hey hi
four
four four its me
youre in a sim
he cant hear you
amazing isnt it
everything we think of
that makes up a person
thoughts emotions history
all wiped away by chemistry
four
hes gone
and were all safer for it
safer how are we safer
the brilliance of the faction system
is that conformity to the faction
removes the threat
of anyone exercising
their independent will
divergents threaten that system
dont get me wrong
theres a certain beauty
in your resistance
your defiance of categorization
but its a beauty we cant afford
four its me its me
please four look at me
look at me
four its me
four stop
stop
stop
four please
its okay its okay
i love you its okay
its okay
i love you its okay
four look at me look at me
its me its me
its me its me
tris

i admire you willing to die
for what you believe
but so am i
you cant do it can you
maybe youre not quite as dauntless
as you thought you were
youre right
im not
im divergent
now shut it down and wipe the program
simulation abort
systemwide shutdown
no no

dont get me wrong
theres a certain beauty
to your resistance
tris

weve left everything behind
but we found ourselves
and each other
tomorrow we may have to fight again
