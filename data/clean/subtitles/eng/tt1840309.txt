they say the war was terrible 
that the rest of the world was destroyed 
our founders built the wall
to keep us safe
and they divided us into
five groups  factions 
to keep the peace 
the smart ones 
the ones who value knowledge and logic
are in erudite 
they know everything 
amity farm the land 
they re all about
kindness and harmony  always happy 
candor value honesty and order 
they tell the truth 
even when you wish they wouldn t 
and then there s dauntless 
they re our protectors 
our soldiers  our police 
i always thought they were amazing 
brave  fearless and free 
some people think dauntless are crazy 
which they kind of are 
come on  beatrice 
my faction is abnegation 
the others all call us  stiffs  
we lead a simple life 
selfless  dedicated to helping others 
we even feed the factionless 
the ones who don t fit in anywhere 
because we re public servants 
we re trusted to run the government 
my father works alongside
our leader  marcus 
it all works 
everyone knows where they belong 
except for me 
my mother says
there s an art to losing yourself 
but i haven t figured it out yet 
i m supposed to never think of myself 
to always help others 
to never look too long in the mirror 
are you nervous 
no 
were you  for your test 
mmm mmm  no 
i was terrified 
but i didn t have any reason to be
and neither do you 
that s all you get 
rules are rules 
today i take the test 
i m scared it ll tell me
i m not abnegation 
that i have to leave my family 
but i m even more scared
that it will tell me to stay 
for my brother caleb  it s easy 
let me help you with that 
he s a natural 
beatrice  do you wanna get the other bags 
sorry 
what if she d been blind
or an amputee 
would you have helped her then 
i was thinking about helping her 
it s not that hard 
for you  maybe 
just relax  beatrice 
take a deep breath and trust the test 
trust the test 
test will tell me who i am 
where i belong 
am i smart 
kind 
am i honest 
selfless 
or brave 
hey  so  all the food
that we re not getting 
you guys are giving away
to the factionless 
  right  yeah 
  yeah 
you re a liar 
why are you lying to me 
everybody knows you keep it for yourselves 
so why don t you just admit it 
huh 
i m talking to you 
are all you stiffs deaf or somethin   hey 
beatrice   
don t 
one hundred years ago  after the war 
our founders created a system
they believed would prevent future conflict
and create lasting peace 
today  aptitude testing
based on your personality
will assign you to one of the factions 
while it is our belief
that choosing the faction
indicated by your test
is the best way to ensure
success within the faction system 
it is your right tomorrow
at the choosing ceremony
to choose any of the five factions 
regardless of your test results 
however  once the choice has been made 
there will be no change permitted 
what is it with you abnegation and mirrors 
we reject vanity 
yeah  i know  sit down 
i m tori 
i ll be administering your test 
you ll be offered a series of choices
to test your aptitude for each faction
until you get one result 
i wouldn t sweat it 
95  get the faction of their origin 
and from the looks of you   
what is it 
bottoms up 
choose 
now  before it s too late 
why  what will i do with them 
choose 
just tell me 
puppy 
get up 
we re going out the back door
before a supervisor comes 
  but what was my result 
  come on 
what happened 
you re going to tell your family
that the serum made you sick
and that i sent you home 
all right 
no  but what was my result 
abnegation 
and erudite 
and dauntless 
dauntless   
your results were inconclusive 
that s impossible 
it doesn t make any sense 
no  not impossible 
it s just extremely rare 
they call it  divergent  
you can t tell anyone about this 
not even your parents 
as far as the world is concerned 
you received an abnegation result
because that is what i manually entered 
so what am i supposed to do
at the choosing ceremony 
i was supposed to learn what to do 
this was supposed to tell me
what faction to choose  the test 
we re supposed to trust the test 
the test didn t work on you 
you have to trust yourself 
what happened to you today 
where did you go after your test 
i got sick 
so they sent me home early 
did you finish your test 
mmm hmm 
what was your result 
what was yours 
why did you just leave
without telling anybody 
i was sick 
beatrice   
i don t think you understand
the level of scrutiny we re under 
they re doing everything they can
to discredit us right now 
who is 
erudite 
they believe that they should be
the governing faction  not us 
so you have to be careful right now  okay 
even marcus is under attack 
for what 
it s an old accusation 
that he mistreated his son
and that s why the boy defected 
  is that true 
  no 
 course not 
children defect for all kinds of reasons 
don t take too long in here 
you need a good night s sleep   
for tomorrow 
i  um   
we love you 
good night 
i m so proud of you  honey 
  beatrice 
  what 
tomorrow when we choose   
you have to think of the family 
yeah 
but you also have to think of yourself 
factions  please gather
in your assigned areas 
morning  jeanine 
good morning  andrew 
how is marcus holding up 
as well as can be expected 
we need to find out
who s behind these rumors 
i think we all know who it is 
if it s someone from erudite 
i promise i ll find out who 
these are your children 
i don t think i knew
they were choosing today 
  what s your name 
  i m    i m caleb 
it s a pleasure to meet you 
jeanine matthews 
and you are 
this is beatrice 
well  you both have a big decision
to make today 
i m sure your parents will support
whatever choice you make 
that s not supposed to be a choice 
the test should tell us what to do 
you re still free to choose 
but you don t really want that 
beatrice   
i want you to choose
who you truly are
and where you truly belong 
not on a whim  not because you
wish you were someone you re not 
but because you honestly know yourself 
i want you to choose wisely 
and i know you will 
the faction system is a living being
composed of cells  all of you 
and the only way it can survive and thrive
is for each of you to claim
your rightful place 
the future belongs to those
who know where they belong 
when we leave this room 
you will no longer be dependents
but full fledged members of our society 
faction before blood 
faction before blood 
i love you   
no matter what

you re gonna be sleeping here
for the next 10 weeks

  that works 
if you like this 
you re gonna love the bathroom

you should feel right at home  candor 
everything out in the open 
is this a joke 
get changed 
right  shower  anyone 
nice legs  stiff 
  hey 
  how you doin  
shall we sit there 
have you never seen
a hamburger before 
no  i ve seen one 
i just have never eaten one 
abnegation eat plain food 
plant based diet with no sauces
and a minimum of seasoning 
which textbook did you swallow 
nice to meet you  too 
i m will  erudite 
of course you are 
no offense  but i m surprised
abnegation even eats at all 
too selfish  right 
no wonder you left 
you gotta be pretty self confident
to be friends with a candor 
what is that supposed to mean 
you have no filter 
you say the first thing
that comes into your head 
you mean like 
 you re an idiot  
nice one  al 
at least we tell the truth 
erudite can tell the truth
because we have the facts 
i don t want to hear
about your old factions 
you re dauntless now 
were you a transfer  too 
or dauntless born 
are you kidding 
no 
what makes you think
you can talk to me 
it   
must be because you re so approachable 
careful 
four   
you  my friend  have a death wish 
you know 
he was first in his class 
they tried to recruit him
for leadership twice 
but he said no 
initiates  stand 
you have chosen to join the warrior faction
tasked with the defense of this city
and all its inhabitants 
we believe in ordinary acts of bravery
and the courage that drives one person
to stand up for another 
respect that 
do us proud 
whoa 
i want everyone in the pit 
two minutes 
there are two stages of training 
the first is physical 
push your bodies to the breaking point
and you ll master the methods of combat 
the second is mental 
again  breaking point 
you ll face your worst fears and conquer
them unless they get you first 
you ll be trained separately
from the dauntless born 
but you ll be ranked together 
after initiations  rankings will determine
what jobs you move into 
leadership  guarding the fence 
or keeping the factionless
from killing each other 
the rankings will also
determine who gets cut 
cut 
at the end of each stage of training 
the lowest ranking initiates will be leaving us 
to do what 
there s no going home to your families 
so you d live factionless 
why didn t we know that 
it s a new rule 
a new rule 
somebody should have told us that 
why 
would you have chosen differently 
out of fear 
i mean  if that s the case 
you might as well get out now 
if you re really one of us 
it won t matter to you that you might fail 
now you chose us 
now we get to choose you 
statistically speaking  you should have
hit the target at least once by now 
even by accident 
hey  what have you got 
factionless  not doing anything 
check it out  stiff 
that s gonna be your new family 
go say  hi  
you ready for some real fighting 
not even close 
first jumper 
in the ring 
last jumper 
time to fight 
how long do we fight for 
till one of you can t continue 
or one of you concedes 
according to the old rules 
new rules  no one concedes 
you really want to lose
 em on their first fight 
a brave man never surrenders 
lucky for you  those weren t
the rules when we fought 
you ll be scored on this 
so fight hard 
go 
don t be scared  stiff 
nice  tris 
  nice 
  yeah 
all right  guys  over here 
listen up 
know what this board is 
it s your life 
we grade you every day 
if you re still in the red by
the end of the first stage 
you re out 
i m never gonna make it 
yes  you are 
i m the weakest one here 
then you ll be most improved 
you re candor 
you re not supposed to lie 
i was candor 
and i m not lying 
if they cut me  i think my parents
would take me back 
no  it doesn t
work like that 
even if they wanted to 
their faction wouldn t allow it 
even if my parents would take me back 
i wouldn t belong there anymore 
this is getting depressing 
yeah 
you know
what we should do  get tattoos 
did you know they had
a tattoo of your face 
  like it 
  yeah 
  where would you get it 
  i don t know 
where do you suggest 
anywhere you want 
here  it s this thing here 
you remember me  right 
i was just wondering
if you could   
no 
i just do tattoos 
okay 
i d like this one 
please 
can i just ask you   
you made a mistake
choosing dauntless 
  they ll find out about you   
  who 
who will 
the people you re a threat to 
what people  who  dauntless 
no  society 
if you don t fit into a category 
they can t control you 
i don t get it 
i m dauntless 
i m going to be dauntless 
i chose dauntless 
for your sake  i hope so 
you re weak 
you have no muscle 
you re never gonna win  not like that 
that s good to know 
yeah  you have to use your whole body 
keep tension here 
  okay   
  and go on offense 
you re fast  so you could win
if you attack first 
you get inside 
you jab to the throat 
four 
keep working 
sorry about that  will 
come on  chris 
stop    stop 
i m done  i m done 
you need to stop 
okay 
let me give you a hand 
thanks 
all right 
let s everyone take a break 
you feelin  a little better 
yeah  i m fine 
whoa 
grab the rail 
or don t 
you ve got three options 
hang there
and i ll forget your cowardice 
fall and die 
or give up 
but if you give up  you re out 
come on  chris 
time 
dauntless never give up 
as dauntless  we fight to protect
every life inside the fence  without fail 
that s why we train you the way we do 
to teach you not to give up 
and to find out who has what it takes 
even though it s been quiet
out there for years 
that could change at any moment 
so we have to be ready for everything 
whoo 
  what s out there 
  monsters 
amity farms 
no  i know  but beyond that 
places that never recovered
from the war 
do you know 
let s just say they built
their fence for a reason 
man 
you re kinda good at this 
come on 
that was pathetic 
it slipped 
well  go get it 
what  while they re throwing 
are you afraid 
of getting stabbed
by an airborne knife  yeah 
everybody stop 
stand in front of the target 
four  gimme a hand here 
you re gonna stand there
while he throws those knives 
and if i see you flinch  you re out 
one thing you will learn here
is that orders are not optional 
stop 
anyone can stand in front of a target 
it doesn t prove anything 
then it should be easy
for you to take his place 
same rules apply 
oh  come on  four 
you can get closer than that 
you want me to give her a little trim 
yeah  maybe just a little off the top 
points for bravery  stiff 
not as many as you just lost
for opening your mouth 
now watch yourself 
we train soldiers  not rebels 
but we re done for today 
get out 
  you all right 
  you cut me 
i meant to 
you meant to 
you think he was gonna
let you off without a scratch 
you d still be standing there
if i hadn t hit you 
so am i supposed
to thank you 
you re supposed to be smart 
if i wanted to hurt you 
i would have 
there she is 
you do have a death wish 
i can t believe you said that to eric 
you re the only one
who s ever stood up to him 
look at your ear 
let s get you cleaned up 
hey  tris 
that was cool 
thanks 
impressive  stiff  congrats 
shut up 
what 
hey  you re famous now 
i mean  not because
of the thing with eric 
you re in the news 
yeah  listen 
 the recent transfers
of beatrice and caleb prior 
 children of andrew prior 
 call into question the soundness
 of abnegation s teachings and values 
 what prompted them to leave 
 perhaps the answer lies in the
corrupted ideal of an entire faction 
 the theft of resources 
the general incompetence 
 the abuse of their children  
did they beat you 
like marcus eaton s kid 
they didn t beat anyone 
they re good people 
right 
and that s why you left 
was it something i said 
  he s an idiot 
  yeah 
yeah  that s okay 
what s she doing at dauntless 
prior 
you re andrew prior s daughter  aren t you 
beatrice 
it s just tris now 
tris  i like that 
hmm 
you made an impressive choice 
tris  despite your parents 
and your test result 
you ve seen my test result 
of course 
i m glad you were smart enough
to know your own mind 
let me know if you ever need anything 
well  that was weird 
yeah 
what do you think is goin  on 
i bet they re hunting divergents 
that s all they talk about
at erudite these days 
wait 
divergents are real 
come on  al 
first fight  peter versus tris 
what 
uh oh 
it s eric 
he s just trying to get back at you 
  hey 
  what 
remember what i said about attack 
first shot  right to the throat 
and you watch him 
he steps before he punches 
all right 
mmm 
all right there  stiff 
look like you re about to cry 
might take it easy on you if you cry 
come on  tris 
get up  get up 
come on 
stop playin  with each other 
wow  you look   
look bad 
how long have i been here 
about a day 
a day 
have you seen the scoreboard

why are you wearing those vests 
war games 
whoa  what are you doing 
  i m coming 
  you can t 
eric says you re done 
what 
he said you re out 
your father s on the council  tris

yeah  okay 
  bye 
  bye 
  bye

hi 
  hi 
  what are you doing here 
i just figured
that i had to make it 
who let you out 
i did 
you did 
okay 
let s sit you down 
the game s simple 
it s like capture the flag 
weapon of choice 
you call that a gun 
neuro stim dart 
simulates the pain of
a real gunshot wound 
only lasts a couple minutes 
two teams 
four and i are captains 
you pick first 
okay  edward 
i ll take the stiff 
oh  picking the weak ones
so you ve got someone
to blame when you lose 
something like that 
where did eric s team go 
they must have gone to the end 
all right  lights off 
gather around  come on 
okay  what s your strategy 
we can hide the flag well enough
so they can t find it 
let s send out a team to scout their location 
see if we can find their flag 
i say we blitz them 
just beat them with sheer force 
yeah  that s the best
way to lose quickly 
end this quickly 
they won t expect it 
we don t know where they are 
okay  we split into two groups 
defense and offense 
who put you in charge 
someone has
to make a decision 
we need to be more aggressive 
we need to be smart about it 
you re not gonna jump  are you 
no  i m just trying to get
a good vantage point 
good thinking 
you don t have to come with me 
you should go easy 
you took a beating 
i m surprised you noticed 
i saw you leave during the fight 
yeah  well  it s not something
i wanted to watch 
hey 
you good 
you okay 
yeah  i m fine 
this is high enough 
no  we need to go higher 
you all right

i didn t think you were afraid
of anything 
come on  tris 
really 
are you even human 
this isn t so bad 
good eye

glamorous 
mom 
oh  my girl 
mom  what are you doing here 
i knew they d assign you
here sooner or later 
look at you 
god  you re so strong and beautiful 
mom  you can t be here 
i know  but you re in danger 
what 
i had to ask you something 
you weren t sick the day you took
your aptitude test  were you 
  why 
  what were your test results 
honey  it s okay 
you can tell me 
they were   
they were inconclusive 
divergent 
you can t tell anyone 
you can t tell your friends 
your instructors 
you can t trust anyone 
i m not 
people have always been
so threatened by divergents 
but now erudite is looking
for them everywhere 
they re actively seeking them out 
why 
mom  what am i 
you don t conform 
your mind works in a million different ways 
they re scared of you 
stage two of training is where
you are most at risk 
they re gonna get inside your head
and watch how you respond to fear 
but you can pass 
you can make it through dauntless 
i have seen it before 
how do you know so much about this 
about dauntless 
never mind about me 
do not let them know who you are 
wait 
wait  were you dauntless 
  listen 
  hey 
what are you doing 
truck s loaded  let s go 
what did they do to her 
tris 
take a seat 
i m going to inject you
with a serum that stimulates
the part of your brain
that processes fear 
great 
it induces a hallucination 
and then transmitters in the serum
allow me to see the images
in your mind 
you can see inside my mind 
mmm hmm 
lay back 
now  you re gonna be facing
your worst fears  tris 
most people have 10 to 15 really bad ones 
you have to calm yourself 
slow your heart rate and your breathing 
and deal with what s in front of you 
be brave 
this isn t real 
it s all right 
it s all right 
you okay 
how long do you think you were
in the hallucination  tris 
  twenty minutes 
  three 
four times faster
than the average 
i ve never seen anyone
do that well the first time 
how did you get rid of the birds 
the image wasn t clear 
um   
i just went into the water 
well  next time it ll be a lot easier 
i have to do that again 
yeah  you have to practice
several times before the final 
but you re a natural 
you got nothing to worry about 
my whole body
was covered in these little insects 
they were in my ears  and my throat   
i couldn t breathe 
yeah  i heard about this guy 
like two years ago   
so panicked he had
a heart attack in his chair
  and he almost died 
  what 
yeah  so we ve got that
to look forward to  right 
you didn t seem to have any problem at all 
me  no  no  my god 
it was awful 
oh  come on 
no one even came close to your time 
  you were amazing 
  yeah  what s amazing is that
she s gonna knock you right out
of dauntless 
she s not gonna knock me out
of dauntless 
look  she s gone from being the worst
to one of the best 
somebody s gotta take her place
at the bottom 
who s it gonna be  you 
do you ever stop talking 
i just want to know how she does it 
what s your trick 
i don t have a trick 
nobody gets through it that fast 
why don t you tell us
how you do it 
at least tell your friends 
what s he talkin  about 
is there some way to make it easier 
no 
no  i   
i m not doing anything 
hey  hey 
this isn t real 
how d you do that 
what 
how d you break the glass 
i don t know  just did it 
you just did it 
what were your test results 
your aptitude test 
abnegation 
i don t think so 
what 
i think you re lying to me 
why would i lie to you 
i m gonna ask you one more time 
what were your test results 
abnegation 
time for you to go 
tris 
just so you know 
dauntless don t break the glass like that 
my brother was like you 
during the second stage 
he got good really fast 
last day of the simulations 
one of the dauntless leaders
came to watch him 
then the next morning 
we found his body
at the bottom of the chasm 
they got rid of him 
who did 
dauntless leadership 
you can t let them find out about you 
and what if they already know 
then you re already dead 
beatrice 
what are you doing here 
i m in trouble 
what happened 
i m not gonna make it at dauntless 
i don t fit in there 
you have to fit in there 
i can t 
i m just   
i m not like them 
i mean  who is 
they re crazy 
maybe i can go back to abnegation 
  you can t go back 
  i know  but   
they re never gonna
let you do that 
  who 
  erudite 
they re not gonna let abnegation
break any more rules 
they actually think that
they re running the government now 
they might be soon 
wait  really 
erudite should be in charge 
certainly not abnegation 
wait  hold on  caleb 
how can you say that 
it s what all the other factions want 
now that abnegation failed 
no  that s just what
they re telling you here   
  it s true 
  it s not true 
it s not 
there are liars here 
there are people who know
how to manipulate you 
you need to understand that 
beatrice 
i think you should go 
faction before blood  yeah 
got it 
i need you to come with me 
stop 
are you all right 
yeah  i m fine 
please  sit down 
thank you 
i m glad you came here today 
you are 
are you happy with your new faction 
yeah 
but you came to see your brother 
i just   
i just wanted to talk to him 
have you seen your parents 
no 
it s hard to let go 
faction before blood 
it s an important ideal 
but sometimes difficult to fulfill 
it goes against
our fundamental human nature 
but that s exactly the weakness
we need to overcome 
you think that human nature is a weakness 
i think human nature is the enemy 
it s human nature
to keep secrets  lie  steal 
and i wanna eradicate that 
that s how we ll maintain
a stable  peaceful society 
you would help me with that  wouldn t you 
how would i help you 
you re aware that abnegation is undermining
the faction system and breaking laws 
harboring divergents 
i didn t know that 
but if that s true 
then i m glad that i left 
see  i need to know
that i can count on you
to enforce the law 
even if it s been broken
by someone close to you 
someone you care about 
of course 
good 
then i ll have my car
take you back to dauntless 
come on  get her over 
come on  do it  do it 
hey 
you all right 
yeah 
come on  let s go 
here  put this on 
thank you 
you ll be safe here 
sorry 
it s okay 
i can t believe al   
you re moving up through the ranks 
and he s failing 
it makes him hate himself
and it makes him hate you 
he s just afraid 
everyone s afraid 
i know  but fear does something strange
to people like al 
but not you 
fear doesn t shut you down 
it wakes you up 
i ve seen it 
you should lie down 
  get some sleep 
  yeah 
i ll take the floor 
how you feeling 
better 
good 
where d you go yesterday 
to see my brother 
it s getting a little boring
for you here  is it 
my brother said that   
he thinks erudite is planning
to overthrow abnegation 
do you think they could do that 
yeah  i do 
i think it s possible 
depends how far they re willing to go 
i m worried about my parents 
yeah 
but i think you got other things
you need to worry about 
don t you 
yeah 
i should go 
hi 
hey 
is that your sweater 
no 
so what happened
to you last night 
tris  can i talk
to you for a second 
listen  i just wanted
to say that i m sorry 
i don t know what s wrong with me 
please  can you ever forgive me 
if you ever come close to me again 
i will kill you 
tris   
you need to stay away from me 
you are a coward 
i just can t believe he would do that 
it s not like him at all 
what s that 
come on 
oh  my god 
guess he just jumped 
tris 
tris 
leave me alone 
i m sorry about al 
it s my fault that he s dead 
no  it s not because of you 
he made his own choice 
he would have been factionless 
he was not gonna pass that final test 
neither am i 
why do you say that 
you know why 
and as soon as all the others find out 
they re gonna kill me 
i m not gonna let that happen 
shut the door 
you re gonna practice 
  in my fear landscape 
  no 
in mine 
we go in together 
have you ever done this before 
no  i haven t 
you sure you want to 
why wouldn t i 
i don t know 
you haven t told me anything about yourself
and now you re just gonna
let me inside of your head 
are you afraid of that 
you re not 
no 
fear of heights 
i m not surprised 
it s not real 
  we could just jump 
  no 
divergent would jump 
dauntless would get to that building 
if you want to pass 
if you want to avoid discovery 
you have to do everything
the way a dauntless would do it 
you have to find some tool 
some method to survive 
fear of confinement 
you have to find a way of stopping it 
what would a dauntless do 
good 
take your time 
i m just enjoying myself
in this shrinking box 
as a dauntless soldier 
you have to follow orders
you don t always agree with 
who is she 
she s an innocent 
i have to kill her 
but i can never do it 
unless i look away 
why are we in abnegation 
your last fear is your worst fear 
it lives in the deepest part of your mind 
marcus had a son 
what was his name 
tobias 
tobias 
tobias   
tobias   
tobias   
i m just trying to help you to be better 
no 
four 
four fears 
four then  four now 
i keep going in there 
but i don t think you ever lose them 
can i ask you something 
sure 
what s your tattoo 
you wanna see it 
it s amazing 
the factions 
why do you have all of them 
i don t want to be just one thing 
i can t be 
i want to be brave and
i want to be selfless   
intelligent and honest and kind 
although i m still working on  kind  
i don t wanna go too fast 
it s okay 
i ve already got my spot on the floor 
morning 
hey 
come on 
i m gonna show you something 
okay 
look 
  erudite 
  yeah 
they re here every morning 
i ve been watching them for weeks 
what are they doing at dauntless 
loading in supplies 
computers 
and these 
what is it 
i think it s some kind
of cognitive transmitter 
you inject it like a serum 
why 
it s supposed
to make you more susceptible to suggestion 
but as many as they have 
they could create an army 
attention 
all initiates report for final testing 
all initiates report for final testing 
you re ready 
you can do this 
they can see
your hallucinations on the screen 
so you get past your fears
the way a dauntless would 
but do it quickly 
right  if i m too good 
then they ll kill me 
and if i m too slow  then i ll die 
right 
good luck 
good luck  tris 
hope you make it 
congratulations 
whoa  four 
stop  four 
aren t you dauntless 
please tell me that
you weren t watching that 
would you feel better if i said no 
you did well 
now   
one final test 
you know what to do 
what 
if you want to be dauntless 
no 
do it 
you all right 
that looked good to me  okay 
come on  let s go 
congratulations 
new members of dauntless 
dauntless 
dauntless  dauntless 
come on  get in line 
all right  everybody  line up 
what s going on 
all dauntless initiates 
report to your command leader 
all right  listen up 
before you leave tonight 
i want you all in four lines 
everyone gets a tracking device 
don t ask questions 
it s just a precaution 
do you see four 
no 
next

  oh  my god 
congratulations 
you should be first in line  but   
i ll make it easy for you 
hurts like a bitch  huh 
now you re really one of us 
hey  what s   
faction before blood 
oh  my god 
they can see and hear us 
they just don t process it
the same way 
commands come in
through the transmitter 
what s goin  on 
what are we doin  
divergent 
hey 
everything s fine 
there s nothing to worry about 
hurry up  move 
abnegation
leaders must identify themselves 
we need to find my parents 
just keep moving 
where s your house 
we are looking
for information 
all houses will be searched 
do not resist 
you will not be hurt 
mom  dad 
where would they have gone 
i don t know 
this can t happen here 
just stop it 
do not resist 
all abnegation will be questioned 
the legendary four   
a mindless drone 
you were first in your class 
now you re   
nothing 
what 
think he might be   
there s one way to find out 
say goodbye  asshole 
goodbye 
move and you die 
the stiff 
two stiffs 
two dead stiffs 
you can t let a single
divergent slip through 
this is what happens 
she s not gonna shoot me 
think you might be overestimating
my character 
run 
  you were hit 
  yeah 
right there  don t move 
drop your weapons 
tobias eaton 
and you  beatrice 
i thought it was intellect
i was sensing in you 
maybe you re not as smart
as you think you are 
why are you attacking
all these innocent people 
innocent people 
abnegation  if left unchecked 
will destroy the faction system 
same can be said of both of you 
somebody has to stop you 
if we don t  peace will be lost 
it s already been lost 
you destroyed it 
human nature destroyed it 
those of us with the vision to see that
are called upon to protect the rest 
we will restore the peace 
and this time  it will last 
and what if you re wrong 
bring him with us 
she s injured 
any results would be unclear 
  you can get rid of her 
  all right 
get down 
let s go  come on 
additional security teams

we need to leave here 
are there soldiers outside 
no  it s clear 
i should have believed you 
i left as soon as i realized 
why is this happening 
i don t understand 
why are dauntless fighting for erudite 
they don t know what they re doing 
they re under simulation 
we need to wake  em up 
i need to get into dauntless 
that s a fortress 
it s not gonna happen 
i can get us in there 
get ready 
what now 
you re not gonna like it 
there s a net at the bottom 
don t think  just jump

let s go 
wait here 
against the wall 
against the wall 
how are you awake 
because i m smarter than you 
and they need me 
where are they controlling it from 
why would i tell you that 
it s not like you re gonna shoot me 
why do people keep saying that 
where are they controlling it from 
did you really need to shoot him 
every minute we waste 
another abnegation dies
and another dauntless
becomes a murderer 
peter  let s go 
that s it  isn t it 
yeah 
i ve seen jeanine go in there 
that s where she s controlling it from 
like you said 
there isn t a second to waste 
dad  no 
dad   
hey 
watch caleb 
i m going in there 
hey  hi 
four   
four    four  it s me 
you re in a sim 
he can t hear you 
amazing  isn t it 
everything we think of
that makes up a person 
thoughts  emotions  history   
all wiped away by chemistry 
four 
he s gone 
and we re all safer for it 
safer  how are we safer 
the brilliance of the faction system
is that conformity to the faction
removes the threat
of anyone exercising
their independent will 
divergents threaten that system 
don t get me wrong 
there s a certain beauty
in your resistance 
your defiance of categorization 
but it s a beauty we can t afford 
four  it s me  it s me 
please  four  look at me 
look at me 
four  it s me 
four  stop 
stop 
stop   
four    please   
it s okay  it s okay 
i love you  it s okay 
it s okay 
i love you  it s okay 
four  look at me  look at me 
it s me  it s me 
it s me  it s me 
tris   
go 
finish it 
help 
hey 
shut it down 
no 
i am not gonna ask you again 
do it 
shut it down 
i admire you willing to die
for what you believe   
but so am i 
you can t do it  can you 
maybe you re not quite as dauntless
as you thought you were 
you re right 
i m not 
i m divergent 
now shut it down and wipe the program 
simulation abort 
system wide shutdown 
no    no   
no 
don t get me wrong 
there s a certain beauty
to your resistance 
tris   
lockdown now in effect 
all right  let s move 
we gotta go  now 
tobias 
we need to keep moving 
all right  move 
son 
i got it 
i know you do 
my mom and dad died today 
they re gone 
i know 
but they loved you  tris 
for them  there was
no better way to show you 
now we have nothing 
we have no home  no faction   
i don t even know who i am anymore 
i know exactly who you are 
you sure about that 
yeah  i m very sure 
come here 
we re like the factionless now 
we ve left everything behind 
but we found ourselves
and each other 
tomorrow we may have to fight again
