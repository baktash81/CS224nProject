and the holy spirit 
may the lord be with you 
my dear brothers

too bad that laura s husband
did not accompany him 
his help was precious
for the work of the facade 
the state of the bell tower would not have it

he misses an opportunity to beg 
take care of your church 
it belongs to you

whore

we will not catch them 
is the gendarmerie called 
do something 
i beg you 
i do not want to scare you 
but newspapers on the bed
could mean
that it is
kidnappers of this girl 
why did they kidnap him 
for money 
what did they do to him 
it may not be the same 
in fact  they had threatened    
to kill the little
if the police were warned 
this is for  a
that you have to be very careful 
they killed him 
they killed him 
you will stay planted there
   do nothing 
who saw it last 
we must ask felipe 
he knows nothing 
except she was tired
and that she went up to bed 
in fact  she was fine 
she had a drink
and all of a sudden    
we would have put something
in his glass 
what 
somnif re    
they probably had an accomplice
   the party 
the current was cut
when she was upstairs 
we must call the gendarmerie 
please 
no way  i do not want
to hurt him 
rflchissons 
what else can be done 
who has the video of the party 
  who kept it 
  the video 
the young people of the center 
who had the idea to invite
offenders 
bea knows them

  4 30 in the morning 
  it does not matter 
bea had told you
that they would come to film 
she proposed  i accepted 
why them 
they would not do that 
paco 
what happened 
we know nothing 
felipe    
did she tell you anything special 
like what 
what she wanted us to do
a joke 
no 
you did not see anyone suspicious 
not at all 
and the pickers 
just something    
we fell on the motorcycle  on the road 
we could not start again 
the pickers arrived
and helped us 
when was it 
yesterday 
anyway    
it was not improvised 
they knew
that laura and her children were coming
and they prepared everything 
newspaper articles    
the power failure 
here  no one has seen them 
it s professionals 
someone went up
put the newspapers on the bed 
a stranger must have entered here 
not necessarily a stranger 
you have to rest  laura 
leave it alone 
did you know this story 
it s been years 
it was in the corner 
not far away 
rest 
let the parents decide
if they go to the police 
i am very scared for the little girl 
less than his mother  anyway 
i should not help them 
you do not know if what you do
help or him night 
let them do it 
and if it were your young people 
why would it be them 
we come back  i m falling asleep 
remember your colleague

one day  it s the cops

they owe me everything 
where would they be without me 
why are you going out now 
because we need money
to save the little one 
ah yes 
it s you who have all dilapidated 
it s enough 
it s not the moment 
for the sake of irene 
we must avoid these scandals

you re not at home 
you are walking here 
as if you were family 
dtrompe up 
your parents were my servants 
antonio  that s enough 
let me talk 
if you do not like it 
shut your ears 
you owe me
even more than all the others

you owe it to me 
your domain 
you forced laura    
let me talk 
you forced my daughter
to give you these lands 
paco 
i forced you to sell your land

  i forced you to sell

i take you first
to see someone 
who 
i ll tell you 
can i keep the video 
no problem  i think 
no 
show the messages

in general  it s easy 
but they know how to hide 
they buy multiple sim cards
with fake papers 
they send sms
since old t l phones
that they destroy  with the map 
after each shipment 
but you still have to
show them to the police 
we have not decided yet
if we would prevent it 
as soon as the gendarmerie
will be informed of the disappearance 
she will intervene 
what should we do 
we must believe
what you are looking for
   to collect money 
how 
by soliciting your entourage 
who could go out
such a sum 
we need to know
what you are looking for 
it will save you time 
how will they know 
they are watching you 
one way or another 
it s safe 
do not talk about this meeting 
not even to the father 
can i see you alone

what s the matter 
it does not seem to go 
i have a service to ask you 
i ask you  before refusing 
to think about it 
i always think
before talking 
i need money urgently 
for the vineyard 
no  it s personal 
can you help me 
i thought 
it s no 
okay 
i am ready to sell you my share 
why  all of a sudden

this association  between us 
can not last 
we must find a good pear
who buys it all

right now 
so  i sell you my part
   low price 
you did not even let buyers
visit the domain

and answer me as soon as possible 
  i have to go 
  where are you going

i m going to think

when did you get it 
at the moment 
she does not have her medication on her 
yes 
i m with laura 
you just received it

hold on  read it 
 your daughter is bad 
she can not breathe anymore

she received the same 
i ll call you back 
i can not breathe

voil

j touffe 
i told him 
 and my mother  
she said 
 prepare your bag softly
 and pull yourself  
that may be what she did 
why would she do that 
i dunno 
good evening 
goodbye 
whore   
do you have something new 
we combed the videos 
nothing 
my friend says something
which makes sense to me 
what if we had not kidnapped him 
they had to come together  right 
why alejandro suddenly
changed your mind 
laura said it was
for work 
he s been working for two years 
  what 
  he would have gone bankrupt 
two years 
whore   
do not give up  fernando 
how he would have climbed
from argentina 
if the kid is wicked    
he can send sms from there 
if that was the case 
laura would have suspected it
the first 
laura  to doubt her husband 
i dunno   
you do not think it s weird
that they write to your wife 
it s weird 
i am very scared 
if something happens to him    
fernando is right 
we must call the gendarmerie 
if we do not do it 
what other choice do we have 
i would call the gendarmerie 
and the time they act 
how the little girl is going to survive
without his medication 
do not worry 
god will help us 
why did he make us 
stop these nonsense 
you have to find the money 
how  they will steal it 
we have to wait 
paco may be able to help us
for money 
a similar sum 
he spoke to his partner
to sell him his share 
why would he do that 
he does not really do it 
he pretends
to make the noise run 
this is his idea 
we went to see
a friend of fernando 
a cop at retirement 
to have his opinion 
he said we had to pretend
to collect money 
and after 
after    
in two days or a week 
when they will know
that we do not have the money 
i dunno 
i do not know 
i can not think anymore 
sorry to bring you here 
my friend prefers    
be careful 
  where is he 
  in the car 
he s waiting for you  his name is jorge 
laura     he wants to see him alone 
he s holding up 
he lets nothing appear 
he is suffering inwardly 
you have full confidence
in your husband 
what is that question 
he loves his children 
we run a risk
if we warn the police 
even if the risk is minimal 
you have to stay very discreet 
they can investigate in secret 
without it being known 
why you did not accompany
your family 
i had job interviews 
it went well 
are you interested 
everything interests me
to save your daughter 
  did you find work 
  no 
why 
why   
ask him
who did not take me 
because of alcohol 
who told you that 
it s been sixteen
i did not drink a drop 
according to your wife 
you are ruined 
so what 
the police will tell you that this act
was not committed by strangers 
of course 
since it s me 
it s his father 
come on  let s go 
who is it 
it s you 
you told all this con 
tell what 
alcohol  unemployment 
bankruptcy  everything 
it s not the moment  alejandro 
it s my daughter 
let me decide
what to do 
tits of fuck 
tits of fuck 
i spoke to him 
i thought that might help 
that would have helped her to know
i m unemployed
and that i am ruined 
  what are you talking about 
  answers 
why would i suspect you 
  did i say that 
  you insinuate it 
why would i suspect you 
  your whole family suspects me 
  what 
did not you see their eyes this morning 
and these two 
they are all worried about your daughter
and you  you speak only of god 
it is normal that they suspect you 
sleep a little 
how to sleep
without knowing where my daughter is
nor what can we do to him 
i hate myself
to do nothing 
we must prevent the police 
my love   
we can help him 
if you agree 
paco could give us the money 
you said he was pretending 
he could do it 
why would he do that 
let me try 
let me talk to him 
to tell him what 
i m ready for anything
to find it 
no 
think irene 
we will lose our daughter 
he will not give it to you 
maybe so 
if he refuses 
we will go to the gendarmerie 
he will not give you the money 
you ll tell him
and you will not get anything 
please 
please 
please 
i asked
to hear the voice of my daughter 
they passed it to me 
she said
that she was not well 
shortly after  they strangled her
and thrown into a well 
when the body has been found 
i could not recognize my daughter 
i said it was not her 
paco    
what are you doing here 
you re alone 
yes 
he answered you 
who 
your partner 
no  no answer 
but the noise ran  that s good 
yes  but   
you would be ready to sell really 
the domain 
yes 
if everything happened to your child 
you would do nothing  either 
i do not know what to say 
this area has employees 
families depend on it 
i know but   
you still have not forgiven me 
what 
to have left you 
you never let me explain 
i do not want to talk about  a 
not here 
neither here nor anywhere 
i do not want to talk about it 
you remember my first return
after getting married in argentina 
we had not seen each other
for three years 
i came alone 
you were not with bea yet 
do you remember 
yes i remember 
from the last night too 
yes too 
you took me to the airport 
we talked during the whole trip 
all of a sudden  you stopped 
you started crying in my arms 
you could not accept
for having lost me 
we went down 
you came near me 
you kissed me    
if you seek revenge on me 
do not hurt the girl 
it s your daughter 
how 
no  do not make me 
it s your daughter 
is it okay 
yes 
what did she want  laura 
help 
you help them already 
money 
  why you 
  i dunno 
she thinks maybe
that she sold me the lands
too cheap 
after all this time 
is it okay 
come sit down 
do you eat with us 
we had lunch 
  we come to the news 
  there is nothing  we wait 
paco and i are very touched
by what you live 
we would like to help you
by all means 
but in fact 
we have the impression
to be considered
as indebted 
as if it was our duty
to help you 
it s not the moment 
everyone is there    
i want things
be clear 
which things 
what bea means    
let her talk 
you have some suggestions
on these lands 
who   you  
you all 
we do not have any intentions 
but we do not forget
how paco bought them 
it was worthless land 
this is    
yes 
paco and me 
we ve had seven years 
to get something out of it 
  these lands are mine 
  they are   who works them 
you will share them
with the pickers 
  we did not come for  a 
  me  yes 
i hope that irene    
will come back soon and we will
will end with these discussions 
it s not because we say nothing
that everything s ok 
i sold them at a low price
to help a friend 
but you needed money 
it s enough 
sorry 
i need it
somebody s money 
thank you 
my daughter
will come back 
god will help us 
excuse me 
  what did you tell him 
  all 
we had sworn 
desolate  it s for the little girl 
it is precisely for her
that we should not say anything 
what did you do 
it s for our daughter 
you thought about his life 
what s the matter 
you did not have that before 
viewing 
have you seen what state you put yourself in 
i will sell my share to andr s 
it was not a stratagem 
i am terrorized for the little girl 
pay these people 
it s encouraging them to continue 
you would not say that
if it was our daughter 
yes 
if you were a mother 
you would be less sure of yourself 
luckily 
i never wanted to be a mother 
it s my daughter 
what did you say 
it s my daughter 
what are you saying 
have you gone mad 
do not touch me 
  we ll talk 
  i do not want 
sit down  let s talk 
i do not want 
listen to me 
  i thought we were hiding nothing 
  i did not hide anything 
go away  i want to be alone 
laura told me yesterday 
she tells you she s your daughter
and you believe it 
we slept together
one last time    
and she fell pregnant 
do not you see they want money 
it started with the domain
you would not have paid enough 
it did not work 
so they take out that lie 
  why a lie 
  and why not 
they want no money 
did not you hear it 
what do you want him to say 
he saves appearances 
and his wife comes to tell you
that she is your daughter 
why this marriage in the village 
you think 
no one is getting married
   the countryside 
they are all wicked 
you slept with her
one last time 
and if the next day 
she slept with her husband 
how do you know it s your daughter 
why is she telling you now 
how can you be so naive 
laura is here 
she s up there with roc o 
why 
my little   
the poor  where is she 
hello 
can you leave us alone 
you lied to him 
what subject 
what you said   paco    
i did not think he would tell you 
if you try
to extract money from him
with this lie 
i ll have to tell your husband everything 
it s not a lie 
my husband knows 
what is happening 
guys have heard in the village
that you are going to sell the estate 
who will pay us 
do not listen to this bullshit 
i will pay you  take the job again 
laura 
laura is here 
she must be at the top  why 
someone wants to see her 
who 
a friend of mine  tell him to come down 
laura 
new 
something is happening 
it looks like you sold
the domain 
yes 
it was closed 
they did it for you to believe
that she was in
and that you realize
later of the abduction 
  this is your son 
  yes 
he slept in the same room
that night 
it s strange
that they did not take him away 
it would have been less risky 
a little sleeping is easier
   bring a teenager 
so 
they had a reason to aim for it 
which 
fernando told me things
about your daughter 
which things 
someone knew
that it was not your daughter 
bea spoke to fernando 
i do not know 
they are not professionals 
but relatives
who hold this information 
nobody knew it until then 
i m not saying they did it
because she s paco s daughter 
for his money 
but they wanted
multiply their chances
to be paid 
in other words 
if you could not pay 
paco would help you 
when we decided
to keep it 
we promised ourselves
to not tell anyone 
be attentive to your surroundings 
try to find who knows 
take a seat 
is it true that he sold 
why 
i dunno 
people say what 
what 
of the madness he commits 
people are talking 
since they have nothing to do
in the village  they speak 
what do they say 
do not do this
only for his child 
and before 
fernando 
please 
at the beginning  there were suspicions 
about my daughter 
what suspects 
paco and laura were together
long time 
they say your daughter does things
that make think paco  small 
one says 
who says it 
  the family 
  but who 
some   
so  they know it 
no one talked about it 
but now
that paco sold his estate    
now   
everyone knows it 
you still love her 
it s for the little girl 
it s not true 
what if they did it themselves 
i know what i m doing 
you do not know 
  who is this girl 
  the girlfriend of my son 
they were there for one night 
alejandro    
i m sure we ll find her 
whoever did  a
can not be far 
i have money 
i received it today 
all the money 
why are you doing this 
why am i doing this 
if i did not do it
and something happened
   irene 
i will never forgive myself 
why do not you forgive yourself 
you have no obligation
towards her 
how 
no obligation  you say 
no  but it s my right 
  ah yes 
  yes 
sixteen years have passed 
sixteen years 
and you tell me
when you need me 
paco  i have to tell you something 
the birth of irene
saved my life 
j tais    
lost  drowned  destroyed by alcohol 
i did not even go back
at home 
a night of desperation 
i asked god 
 kill me or save me  my god  
that night  i came back
and laura told me
that she was pregnant with you 
i thought that was the end 
that i had lost it 
for good  really 
but the opposite happened 
god gave me a big shot
to make me react 
  god 
  yes 
laura wanted to abort 
i did not know 
i convinced her to keep it 
god gave me this shot
to get me out of the shit 
god 
my god 
it s him
who got me out of hell 
i m sure
that he will save her too 
your god will save irene 
maybe he uses me
to save irene 
you saved it once 
this time it s me 
i risk my daughter s life
for your pride of shit 
what pride 
i have no more pride 
you do not have any more pride 
so  accept his help
for save her 
your god would have done it already 
if he had wanted 
  what are you doing here 
  tell him to come 
  did you follow 
  no  call him 
you never had to come here 
  how s my daughter 
  well  but i can not continue 
what s the matter 
  we could follow her 
  shut up 
i want to hear it 
we must stop 
my family is destroyed 
what is happening 
  paco sold the estate 
  it s good 
we must lick it 
they are suspecting the whole family 
and you 
i do not know 
tomorrow  they will discover everything 
tomorrow  it will be over 
be quiet 
i can not see them anymore 
  wait tomorrow 
  no 
  do not shit 
  do not worry about it 
if we get caught 
we put you out of cause 
free it or i balance everything 
  wait until tomorrow morning 
  no 
you can not say no
after all these galleys 
  where are you going 
  to prevent them 
hold on 
  no 
  hold on 
i can not anymore 
you promised to stay until the end 
  i was wrong 
  it s too late 
let s separate for real 
instead of pretending 
tomorrow it will be over  we will leave 
we will be stopped 
i want to touch this money 
cost 
  not me 
  we had an agreement 
it was part of the agreement 
to write to paco s wife 
did you do that 
i did that 
send messages
without telling me about it 
write to one person only
it would have been fishy 
  you re avenging my family 
  i hate them  these assholes 
you will shut your mouth 
do not force me to say everything
