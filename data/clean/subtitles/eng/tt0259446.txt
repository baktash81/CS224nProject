since i was 15   
because nice greek girls are supposed
to do three things in life 
marry greek boys  make greek babies 
and feed everyone   
until the day we die 
when i was growing up 
i knew i was different 
the other girls were blond and delicate 
and i was a swarthy 6 year old
with sideburns 
i so badly wanted to be
like the popular girls   
all sitting together  talking   
eating their wonder bread sandwiches 
what s that 
it s moussaka 
moose ka ka 
and while the pretty girls
got to go to brownies   
i had to go to greek school 
at greek school 
i learned valuable lessons like 
 if nick has one goat and maria has nine 
how soon will they marry  
my mom was always cooking foods
filled with warmth and wisdom   
and never forgetting that side dish
of steaming hot guilt 
niko  don t play with the food 
when i was your age  we didn t have food 
 ma 
 what 
why do i have to go to greek school 
when you get married  don t you want to be
able to write your mother in law a letter 
niko  come on  eat 
we lived in a normal  middle class chicago
neighborhood of tasteful  modest homes 
our house  however 
was modeled after the parthenon   
complete with corinthian columns 
and guarded by statues of the gods 
in case the neighbors had
any doubts about our heritage   
they could just check out
our subtle tribute to the greek flag 
my dad believed in only two things   
that greeks should educate non greeks
about being greek   
and that any ailment  from psoriasis
to poison ivy  could be cured with windex 
six years later  i was 12 
athena  my older  perfect sister  was 15 
and my brother  nick  was 11 
every morning  my dad would lecture us
on the  history of our people   
 the great civilization  the greeks   
now  name three things the greeks did first 
astronomy  philosophy  and democracy 
bravo  very good 
now  give me a word   
any word   
and i show you  how the root of that word   
is greek 
sweet lord  again 
how about  arachnophobia  
 arachna   that comes from
the greek word for spider   
and  phobia  is a phobia  it means  fear  
so   fear of spiders   there you go 
okay  mr  portokalos 
how about the word  kimono  
  kimono  
 good one 
kimono  kimono 
of course   kimono 
comes from the greek word   
 cheimonas   which means  winter  
so  what do you wear in the wintertime   
to stay warm  a robe 
you see   robe    kimono   there you go 
 bye bye 
 goodbye  mr  portokalos 
toula 
you should be proud to be greek 
a couple more years went by   
and my dad brought his mother
from greece to live with us   
because we weren t weird enough 
 where is she going 
 mama  please 
the greeks and the turks friends now 
we told my grandma the war was over   
but she still slept
with a knife under her pillow 
stop hitting me 
niko  be careful 
she has a very mean punch 
nice greek girls who don t find a husband

 where did you get that 
 i drew it  dad 
dad  i ve been going through
our inventory   
and i ve noticed that we ve been doing
a lot of unnecessary ordering 
i ve been thinking that
maybe we should update our system 
we could get a computer 
i don t know if you remember 
but i got all a s in computers 
but there s a lot of new stuff to learn now   
so  if you want  i could go to college
and take a few courses 
why 
why you want to leave me 
i m not leaving you 
don t you want me
to do something with my life 
yes  get married  make babies 
you look so old 
hey  toula  come on 
i know what you want 
you have  how you say  a spirit 
you want to see things  you want to learn 
i know  you re from my side 
come on  don t you worry 
i m gonna talk to him 
dad is so stubborn  what he says goes 
 the man is the head of the house  
let me tell you something  toula 
the man is the head 
but the woman is the neck 
and she can turn the head
any way she wants 
my baby 
don t cry  come on 
and what is wrong with toula
going to school downtown 
they use drugs downtown 
what are you saying  are you saying
that toula will get involved with drugs 
no  but somebody will say to her 
 take this bag down to the bus depot  
and she ll do it 
she s not stupid  she s smart 
i know she s smart 
so what for she needs more school 
she s smart enough for a girl 
you think you re smarter than me 
no  i mean  you know  
what  what do you mean 
i run the restaurant  i cook  i clean   
i wash for you  and i raised three kids   
and i teach sunday school 
you know  it s lucky for me
i have you to tie my shoes 
maria    
 is this seat taken 
 sure 
hi 
that s what i want to talk to you about 
 look at you  what are you talking about 
 what 
i don t like my butt  taki likes it 
i won t pretend the travel industry
is something i ve always wanted to do 
i m not gonna pretend that 
but i m saying that it s different 
you know i ve been learning
about computers 
there s this course  a seminar 
it s all about computers and tourism 
there are all the latest applications
and programs 
i could apply it here  thia 
and your business would double or triple 
you could be with thio more 
and you could take a vacation 
i could book it for you 
but  thia  would you hire me 
of course 
my god 
we must let kosta think this was his idea 
that he came up with it 
 ma  he ll figure it out 
 don t worry 
 i know what to do 
 you don t know what to do  you talk 
do you want my help  tell me what to say 
but don t tell me what to say 
 perfect 
 that s good 
so  voula  how is business 
woe to me  business is bad 
what s the matter  what happened 
do you need money 
no  what she means is that 
with the two businesses  she suffers 
she suffers  she has to be
at the travel agency alone  all day   
because everybody else needs to be
working at the big dry cleaning store 
that s right 
i make taki go to the dry cleaner store   
and now i have no time with him 
so  send angelo or nikki   
to the travel agency 
you be with taki at the dry cleaner 
 that would be good 
 that would be no good 
because   
neither angelo nor nikki
know how to use the computer 
that s why that no work 
computer 
i have your answer 
toula will go to the travel agency   
and you send nikki here to work for us 
i can t believe this 
wonderful 
you see  a man

and  miller  come from   
the greek word milo   
which is mean  apple   
there you go 
as many of you know   
our name portokalos   
is come from the greek word portokali   
which means  orange   
so  okay

we all different   
but  in the end  we all fruit
