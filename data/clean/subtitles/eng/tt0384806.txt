the rest of the house 
this    this is a mistake 
how s that 
no  i mean your ad in the paper 
this is   
it s gotta be a misprint 
i m a contractor   
   and i know what a place
like this should cost 
and  you know  if this is   
well  if this is true  then this is a   
the deal of a lifetime 
and what is wrong with that 
  come on 
  i love it 
  there s a vibrant history here 
  vibrant history  george 
in fact  the house was built
in 1692  at least the basement 
the rest of the house was added
from that foundation 
it s one of the oldest dutch colonials
in long island 
wow  that s impressive 
this room would be perfect
for children  if you have any 
and the view s   
well  have a look for yourselves 
there s a boathouse 
oh  all you need now
is a boat  right 
actually  george has a speedboat 
this place sounds
like it s made for you 
and this is your basement 
as you can see 
it s very spacious 
it can be a game room 
a playroom 
well  let s    let s have a look 
i ll just wait up here 
yep  looks like a basement 
so  what do you guys think 
  i think you look foxy in that skirt 
  will you stop it  come on 
yes  yes  okay 
it s a value  it s a value
for people with money 
okay  look  if we do this  we re
gonna be eating dry wall for a year 
we deserve this  george 
you deserve this 
how many times you tell me
how hard you work for so little 
  kathy   
  maybe today is the day it all pays off 
  we ll make sacrifices 
  huge sacrifices 
yeah  i understand that 
listen  honey   
   this is the life we want 
  we re happy 
  yes  we re happy 
she s happy  i m broke 
hold on  hold on  hold on

there s always a catch 
there was a tragedy  a crime   
   a murder 
  i m sorry  what 
in the house 
several people  a family 
but  you know  we ve moved on 
the whole town 
it is a distant memory now 
and the house is fine

to buy this house  honey 
well  houses don t kill people 
people kill people 
just    excuse us 
do you think we can make it work 
you know what 
you want it 
then we re gonna make it work
