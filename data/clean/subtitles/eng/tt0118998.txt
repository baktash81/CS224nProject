with your dog  or a baseball  or a banana 
well  what if it wasn t pretend 
what if you could have a conversation 
i mean  not with a baseball or a banana  
that s ridiculous  but with your dog   
i mean  we don t have the same concept
of time that  for instance  people do 
because you have watches and clocks 
but we do know that you go away  and it s
not like we don t know that you re gone 
so  we don t know exactly how long  no 
why do dogs sniff each other s butts 
well  that s just kinda
our way of shaking hands 
if you really wanna get a sense of
who somebody is  you gotta sniff their butt 
son  stop talkin  to the dog 
she doesn t understand a word 
at first his dad thought  hey  it s harmless  
but as time went on  john crossed that
fine line between harmless and just weird 
mr galvin 
  mr dolittle 
  this is my son john 
  john  this is your new principal  mr galvin 
  nice to meet you  john 
that s not good 
  nice to meet you 
  john    
it was time to put an end to it 
thank you for coming  reverend 
leave this boy  devil man  go now  satan 
take the serpent s voices with you 
i command you to come outta this boy 
come on outta this boy 
god said it  come on 
i m gonna bite ya 
get off 
get this dog    get this dog off of me 
she was my best friend 
you ll make some real friends now 
from that day on  john dolittle
never spoke to animals again 
someday  you re gonna thank me for this 
and after a while all he could remember
was that deep down
there was something missing 
and  just like his dad wanted  he grew up
to be a regular guy  you know  miserable 
hey  hey  get outta here 
stupid mutt 
a vicious animal s in the hallway 
did i mention he was a father  a lot like his
own father  who was a father to him before
he himself became   
she s got a giant egg 
  good morning  charisse 
  i have changed my name to paprika 
paprika  paprika dolittle 
that has a nice ring to it 
not dolittle  just paprika 
well  i don t understand it 
what is that about 
you know  salt n pepa  paprika 
  ok  paprika  i get it 
  i think paprika is a beautiful name 
really  i think paprika
sounds like a seasoning 
  dolittle 
  he doesn t take anything we want seriously 
tell me about it 
i did go over the proposal  it s unbelievable 
  ok  i m on my way in now 
  maya  where are you goin  with that 
  it s for my swan egg i found 
  looks like it d be a good omelette 
  it s gonna hatch any day now 
  you ll miss that cos you ll be at camp 
i can t go  when a bird hatches  the first thing
it sees  it bonds with it  i want it to be me 
you know  it is not healthy for you
to spend all your time with your experiments 
an experiment for you would be to spend
time with kids your own age at camp 
which is exactly where you re goin 
this sunday   camp 
and what about my pet egg 
here  here s half a dozen pet eggs
to take with you to camp 
  stop it

  a guinea pig

no  don t  please 
please  ju    no  no  no  don t 
please  i m begging you 
dolittle 
come on 
so  what seems to be the problem 
well  i really think it s pulmonary distress 
and he might have fluid on his lungs 
  let me guess  you re an md 
  yes  i am 
i can always tell when a real doctor comes in 
they always do a little amateur diagnosis 
  tell him to get away from my butt 
  i did go to veterinary school for five years 
is it just me 
or is he hovering around my butt a lot 
and unlike an md 
my patient cannot tell me where it hurts 
seriously 
could you tell him my butt is great 
so  doctor  if you don t mind   
hey  where s he s gonna put that 
look  look  i was faking it  ok  i feel fine 
just don t let him stick that   
hello 
let s just have a listen to those lungs 
i m gonna swallow it 
and i don t mean in my mouth 
dr fish  i should pull that out a little bit 
  don t you touch that 
  it s headin  in  it s goin  south for the winter 
now  you see  i have to interpret
what the dog is moaning about 
what s to interpret 
there s a thermometer  it s in my butt 
  take it easy  it ll be over in a minute 
  what 
  yes 
  well  there it goes  butt just swallowed it 
doctor  i m just guessing  but i think
you might have just lost your thermometer 
it s gone 
all right  i have    i have three options 
  one  i can manually retrieve it 
  what s he sayin  
options  retrieve it manually 
  pass 
  two  give the dog a laxative and wait it out 
and three  surgically remove it 
  a laxative or surgery 
  laxative 
why don t you just give him a laxative 
it d probably come out later on 
  never works 
  so what would you suggest 
i d like to go in manually 
  here we go 
  oh  my lord 
this is not good  lassie go home 
why on earth would a guy
go into a line of work like that 
  all right  that s it for you  hit the road 
  what  but i m your pet 
you are not my pet  if i were gonna get a pet 
i wouldn t get one as annoying as you  go 
hey  don t worry about it 
you sprung me from the joint  i m thankful 
  yeah  just go 
  don t worry about me 
i ll just be goin  down the road 
disappearing without a trace 
i hope a car doesn t hit me

  i guess so  yeah 
  those were the most exciting times to me 
it was like  you felt like
you were making a difference  you know 
and last night i had to treat some   
some emergencies 
and i was challenged  and it was difficult 
and i got the same kind of rush
i had back then 
i felt like i was doin  somethin  
like i was makin  a difference 
and i started thinkin  that here i m not giving
my patients the right amount of attention 
do me a favour  don t confide in me 
i m utterly useless  i m very self absorbed

oh  my goodness  i have to sit 
here s what we do  we tell johnny
we re gonna fix his little tiger up
after he signs  ok 
then we ll have him committed 
it s perfect  that way we get our money 
it s shifted to the left 
so there s something applying pressure to it 
you can t operate on a tiger 
especially as you don t know the symptoms 
  double vision and headaches  he told me 
  you ll wind up back at hammersmith s 
i ve been supportive 
but if you expect me to believe
that a tiger told you his symptoms 
i might have to draw the line 
you have to do something  quick 
we gotta get him into or fast 
it s the only chance he s got 
what about the press conference 
20 bucks says this guy never shows 
watch your back 
trying to get to the operating room 
  outta the way  please 
  clear a spot  we have an emergency here 
clear the way  please  comin  through
