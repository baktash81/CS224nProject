with your dog or a baseball or a banana
well what if it wasnt pretend
what if you could have a conversation
i mean not with a baseball or a banana
thats ridiculous but with your dog
i mean we dont have the same concept
of time that for instance people do
because you have watches and clocks
but we do know that you go away and its
not like we dont know that youre gone
so we dont know exactly how long no
why do dogs sniff each others butts
well thats just kinda
our way of shaking hands
if you really wanna get a sense of
who somebody is you gotta sniff their butt
son stop talkin to the dog
she doesnt understand a word
at first his dad thought hey its harmless
but as time went on john crossed that
fine line between harmless and just weird
mr galvin
mr dolittle

dolittle
come on
so what seems to be the problem
well i really think its pulmonary distress
and he might have fluid on his lungs
let me guess youre an md
yes i am
i can always tell when a real doctor comes in
they always do a little amateur diagnosis
tell him to get away from my butt
i did go to veterinary school for five years
is it just me
or is he hovering around my butt a lot
and unlike an md
my patient cannot tell me where it hurts
seriously
could you tell him my butt is great
so doctor if you dont mind
hey wheres hes gonna put that
look look i was faking it ok i feel fine
just dont let him stick that
hello
lets just have a listen to those lungs
im gonna swallow it
and i dont mean in my mouth
dr fish i should pull that out a little bit
dont you touch that
its headin in its goin south for the winter
now you see i have to interpret
what the dog is moaning about
whats to interpret
theres a thermometer its in my butt
take it easy itll be over in a minute
what
yes
well there it goes butt just swallowed it
doctor im just guessing but i think
you might have just lost your thermometer
its gone
all right i have i have three options
one i can manually retrieve it
whats he sayin
options retrieve it manually
pass
two give the dog a laxative and wait it out
and three surgically remove it
a laxative or surgery
laxative
why dont you just give him a laxative
itd probably come out later on
never works
so what would you suggest
id like to go in manually
here we go
oh my lord
this is not good lassie go home
why on earth would a guy
go into a line of work like that
all right thats it for you hit the road
what but im your pet
you are not my pet if i were gonna get a pet
i wouldnt get one as annoying as you go
hey dont worry about it

why do you think hed talk back to you
you know he just might
and what would he say
id say you were a butthead
i really like this cat
hes recommending you stay

lisa is a wonderful woman
jesus
its ok
its a friggin tiger
he wont hurt you
i know him
be afraid be very afraid
oh my goodness i have to sit
heres what we do we tell johnny
were gonna fix his little tiger up
after he signs ok
then well have him committed
its perfect that way we get our money
its shifted to the left
so theres something applying pressure to it
you cant operate on a tiger
especially as you dont know the symptoms
double vision and headaches he told me
youll wind up back at hammersmiths
ive been supportive
but if you expect me to believe
that a tiger told you his symptoms
i might have to draw the line
you have to do something quick
we gotta get him into or fast
its the only chance hes got
what about the press conference
20 bucks says this guy never shows
watch your back
trying to get to the operating room
outta the way please
clear a spot we have an emergency here
clear the way please comin through
