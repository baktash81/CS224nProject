mama  cars don t behave 
they are behaved upon 
you demolished that
chrysler by yourself

i know the truth 
the truth is you just cost
the insurance company  2 700 
you are a terrible risk 
nobody will issue you a policy now 
you re just saying that to be hateful

there if he didn t up and die 
mrs  stone asked me to move

it s a difficult situation 
she done gone around the bend a little 
that will happen as they get on 
no  she s all there 
too much there is the problem 
i want you to understand something 
my mother is a little high strung 
the fact is  you would
be working for me 
she can say anything she likes   
   but she can t fire you  understand 
yes  sir 
yes  sir  i sure do 
don t worry  mr  werthan 
i ll hold on no matter
which way she run me 
i was a little boy back on the farm
above macon where i come from 
i wrestled hogs to the
ground during killing time 
well  sir  there ain t a
hog got away from me yet 
how are you  idella 
living 
  where s the new vacuum cleaner 
  in the closet 
she won t touch it 
it gives me a shock
every time i m near it 
it works for me 
good  then you clean and i ll
go down and run your office 
where s mama 
up yonder 
i guess you know who this is 
i ll be right back 
i wouldn t be in your shoes   
   if the sweet lord jesus came
down and asked me himself 
good morning  mama 
just come down and say hello 
you listen here 
unless they rewrote the constitution
and didn t tell me  i still have rights 
of course 
what i do not want  and absolutely
will not have  is   
   some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen 
gobbling my food  using my phone 
i hate that in my house 
you have idella 
idella s different 
she s been coming to me for years 
we stay out of each other s way 
even so  there are chips
in my wedding china 
you think idella has a vendetta
against your wedding china 
don t be sassy 
when we couldn t afford them 
we did for ourselves 
that s still the best way 
 them    afford them  
you sound like governor talmadge 
what a thing to say 
i m not prejudiced 
aren t you ashamed  
you might as well make the best of it 
i knew a miss idella once 
back down in macon 
you don t say 
she sang 
what are you talking about 
i m talking about this
woman had some lungs 
she d be a whole church
choir by herself 
i declare 
fat  too 
she was as big as that stove 
don t talk to idella 
she has work to do 
what are you doing 
dusting the bulbs  miss daisy 
that s the silliest thing i ever saw 
who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty 
get down from there 
put that ladder away
before somebody trips 
i m gone  miss daisy 
all right  idella  see you tomorrow 
  i m going too  miss daisy 
  good 
good morning  miss daisy 
thought i d see after your zinnias 
leave me flower bed alone 
you got a nice piece of ground behind
the garage that ain t doing nothing 
i could put in tomatoes   
if i want a vegetable garden 
i ll plant it myself 
what are you doing 
i just love a house with
pictures  miss daisy 
it do make a home 
i don t want you nosing
through my things 
good morning  miss daisy 
it was right cold in the night 
i wouldn t know  i was asleep 
idella says we re
running short on coffee   
   and dutch cleanser 
we are 
yes  ma am 
we re low on silver polish  too 
i know 
i m fixing to go to the
piggly wiggly on the trolley 
on the trolley 
why don t you let me carry you 
no  thank you 
ain t that why mr  werthan hired me 
that s his problem 
all right  but i m going to
find something to do here 
you leave my things alone 
i m gone to the market  idella 
miss daisy  it s a shame 
you have this fine hudson
automobile out there in the garage 
it hasn t moved an inch from
when mr  werthan drove it here 
that insurance company gave you
a brand new car for nothing 
that s your opinion 
my other opinion is that a fine rich 
jewish lady like yourself   
   has no business dragging herself
onto a trolley carrying grocery bags 
i ll carry them for you 
i don t need you 
i don t want you 
and don t say i m rich 
  i won t say it no more 
  is that what you and idella talk about 
i hate being discussed behind
my back in my own house 
i was born on forsyth street 
believe me  i know
the value of a penny 
my brother brought
home a white cat once 
we couldn t keep it because
we couldn t afford to feed it 
my sister saved up money   
   so i could become a teacher 
we had nothing 
but you re doing all right now 
what are you doing  
i m trying to drive you to the store 
where are you off to this
morning  miss werthan 
just a little shopping 
go away  i ve ridden the trolley
with the groceries plenty of times 
but i can t keep taking
mr  werthan s money for doing nothing 
how much he pay you 
miss daisy  that s between him and me 
anything over  7 a week
is highway robbery 
you sure are right about that 
especially since i don t do nothing   
   but sit on a stool all day 
all right 
piggly wiggly 
then home  nowhere else 
oh  i just love the smell of a new car 
don t you  miss daisy 
i am nobody s fool  hoke 
i know 
my husband taught me to run a car 
i remember everything he said 
so don t think even for a second you   
wait  you re speeding 
i can see it 
we only going 19 miles an hour 
i like to go under the speed limit 
but the speed limit is 35 here 
the slower you go the more gas you save 
my husband taught me that 
ain t hardly moving 
might as well walk   
   to piggly wiggly 
is this your car 
no 
do you pay for the gas 
  no 
  all right  then 
my son thinks i m losing my abilities   
   but i am still in control
of what goes on in my car 
where are you going 
to the store  like you said 
why didn t you turn on highland 
piggly wiggly ain t on highland 
i know where it is 
now take highland avenue 
  that s 3 blocks out of the way 
  go back this minute 
  i can t turn now 
  i ve been driving to piggly wiggly   
   since it opened for business 
this isn t the way 
go back this minute 
miss daisy  look  yonder
is the piggly wiggly  see 
get ready to turn 
careful  there s a little girl 
yes  i see her 
pull in here 
wait 
give me the keys 
stay right here by the car 
and don t tell everyone my business 
mr  werthan 
yes  sir  it s me  guess where i m at 
i just drove your mama to the store 
you know  she flapped around some 
but she s all right  she s in the store 
oh  lord  she just looked
out the window and seen me 
she ll probably throw a fit right
there at the check out counter 
yes  sir  you are right about that 
it only took me 6 days 
same time it took the
lord to make the world 
yes  sir  all right   bye 
hey oscar  junior  how you
old boys doing today 
how the lady been treating you 
i ll tell you one thing 
she knows how to throw a fit 
what s so funny 
nothing  miss daisy 
we just carrying on 
oscar and junior been doing cleaning
here for 15 years  never carried on before 
leave them alone 
put your coat on 
we re late 
idella  i m gone now 
i m right behind her 
hear  oh israel  the lord
our god  the lord is one 
such a nice man  and such a good 
short sermon  wasn t it 
i can get it myself 
hurry out of here 
is something wrong  miss daisy 
something i done 
yes 
i haven t done anything 
you parked the car right in front of the
temple  like i was the queen of romania 
everybody saw you 
i said to wait for me in back 
yes  ma am  but i was just trying to   
there were two chauffeurs
right behind me 
you made me look like a fool 
a g d  fool 
oh  miss daisy  lord
knows you ain t no fool 
slow down 
miriam and beulah  i could see what
they were thinking when we came out 
what s that 
that i was pretending to be rich 
  you is rich 
  no  i m not 
nobody can say i put on airs 
on forsyth street we made many
meals of grits and gravy 
i have done without plenty of times 
miss daisy  if i was to ever
get my hands on what you got   
   shoot  i d shake it around
for everyone in the world to see 
that s vulgar  don t talk to me 
never understand some white folks 
what was that   i heard that 
now  miss daisy   
you needs a chauffeur   
   and lord knows i need a job 
so why don t we just leave it at that 
good morning  mama 
what s the matter 
no  i don t always think
something s wrong when you call 
just when you call so early 
what  
all right  i ll be there
as soon as i can 
i better get on over there 
 bye 
come on 
it s not healthy to rush like this 
i eat too much  anyway 
besides  it sounds like she needs me 
when doesn t it 
give mother werthan my love 
coffee  katie bell 
i didn t expect to
find you in one piece 
i wanted you to be here
when he comes 
i wanted you to hear it
for yourself 
what is going on 
he s stealing from me 
hoke  are you sure 
i don t make empty accusations 
i have proof 
this  i found it hidden in the
garbage under some coffee grounds 
  he stole a can of salmon 
  here it is 
i knew there was something funny 
they all take things  you know 
so i counted 
the silverware first 
then the linen napkins 
and then i went into the pantry 
and the first thing that
caught my eye was a hole   
   behind the lima beans 
and i knew right away 
there are only 8 cans of salmon 
i had 9 
3 for  1 on sale 
very clever  mama 
i missed my breakfast and
i m late to a meeting   
   for a 33c can of salmon 
you want 33c  here s  1 
here s  10  buy yourself
a pantry full of salmon 
why  boolie  the idea 
waving money at me like that 
i don t want money 
i want my things 
  one can of salmon 
  well  it was mine 
i leave him plenty of food every day 
i tell him exactly what it is 
like children  if they want
something  they just take it 
he ll never admit this 
 no   he ll say   i don t
know nothing about that  
i don t like it  i don t
like living with no privacy 
go ahead  defend him 
you always do 
i give up  you want to drive again 
arrange your own insurance 
take the trolley 
buy yourself a taxicab 
anything you want 
just leave me out of it 
why  boolie 
what s he doing here
this time of morning 
can t be good  i promise you that 
i think it s fixing to
clear up out there 
excuse me  mr  werthan 
y all busy 
we have to have a little talk  hoke 
all right  just let me
get out of my coat 
yesterday  while you were out 
i ate a can of your salmon 
now i know you said to eat
the leftover pork chops 
well  they were kind of stiff 
so  i stopped by the piggly
wiggly and got you another can 
do you want me to put it on the shelf 
yes  thank you  hoke

it s good to come in nice weather 
yes  ma am  you sure

mr  sig s grave is mighty well tended 
i think you re the best widow
in the state of georgia 
boolie s always pestering me to have
the staff here tend to this plot 
 perpetual care   they call it 
well  don t you do it 
it s right to have member of
the family looking after you 
i ll never have that  boolie will have
me in perpetual care before i m cold 
miss daisy  you ought to
go on away from here 
put that azalea on leo bauer s grave 
leo bauer  is that miss
rose bauer s husband

where is his grave at  miss daisy 
i m not exactly sure  i know
it s two rows over that way 
you ll see the headstone   bauer  
what s wrong 
nothing wrong 
nothing the matter at all 
now  you say   
i told you it s two rows over that way 
it says  bauer  on the headstone 
what that look like 
what are you talking about 
i m talking about i can t read  ma am 
what  
i can t read  miss daisy 
you look at the paper all the time 
well  that s just it  i just be looking 
i try to dope out what s going on   
   from the pictures 
you know your letters 
yes  ma am  i know my abc s 
i just can t read 
stop saying that 
you re making me mad 
if you know letters  then you can read 
you just don t know you can read 
i taught some of the stupidest
children god ever put on this earth 
and they all could read enough
to find a name on a tombstone 
the name is  bauer  
 bauer   what does that  buh 
letter sound like 
  b 
  of course 
 er   that is the last part   bauer  
what letter sounds like  er  
r 
  so the first letter is   
  b 
and the last letter 
r 
b r  brr 
it even sounds like bauer  doesn t it 
it sure do  miss daisy  it sure do 
  that it 
  that s it 
  what about the middle 
  not right now 
this will be enough for you to find it 
b at the beginning 
r at the end 
b    r 
that s it 
that s all right 
i sure do appreciate this 
don t be ridiculous 
let s get all this back in the car 
i m burning up 
of course i told you 
of course i told you 
how can i be expected to buy it
if you don t write it down  
i m sorry  miss florine 
i need you 
i ll be right there 
do you have any idea what it takes
to give a christmas reception 
it takes an eye for detail 
i told you a million times 
katie bell  write it down 
more i cannot do 
we are out of coconut 
i m sure we can manage 
  i told her 
  you didn t write it down 
i don t need to stand and
listen to excuses on christmas 
you figure out how to serve ambrosia to
50 people without coconut  i give up 
don t worry  katie bell 
it s not quite the end of the world 
everybody s giving the georgia
power company a merry christmas 
bet miss florine beat them all 
especially with the new house 
absurd 
if i had a nose like florine  i wouldn t
say   merry christmas  to anybody 
i enjoy christmas at their house 
no wonder  you re the
only christian in the place 
they got that new cook 
florine never could keep help 
of course  it s none of my affair 
too much running around 
the garden club this   
   the junior league that 
as if they d give her the time of day 
she d die before she d fix a glass of
iced tea for the temple sisterhood 
i hope she doesn t take it into
her head to sing this year 
lord have mercy 
look what miss florine done 
if her grandfather  old man
frietag  could see this 
what is it you say 
i bet he d jump out of his
grave and snatch her baldheaded 
jump up and snatch her baldheaded 
oh  miss daisy  you
go on away from here 
wait a minute 
this isn t a christmas present

me no book before 
 zaner method writing

i saved a few 
it s faded  but it works 
if you practice  you ll write nicely 
but you have to practice 
i taught mayor hartsfield
out of the same book 
i sure do thank you 
it s not a christmas present 
jews have no business
giving christmas presents 
you don t have to go yapping
about this to boolie or florine 
this is between you and me 
merry christmas  mother werthan 
i hope i don t spit up 
merry christmas  mama  hoke

i was 12 
we went on the train 
oh  i was so excited 
i d never been in a wedding party 
i had never seen the ocean 
papa said it was the gulf of mexico  not
the ocean  but it was all the same to me 
i asked papa if it was all right
for me to dip my hand in the water 
and he laughed because i was so timid 
and then i tasted the
salt water on my fingers 
isn t that a silly thing to remember 
no sillier than most of
what folks remember

morning  miss daisy 
what in the world    
i learned how to drive on ice when
i delivered milk for the dairy 
ain t nothing to it 
other folks are banging into each
other like they re in the funny papers 
i figured your stove was out  so
i stopped by the krispy kreme 
i know you got to have
coffee in the morning 
how sweet of you  hoke 
we ain t had any good coffee
around here since idella passed 
i can fix her biscuits 
we both can make her fried chicken 
but nobody can make idella s coffee 
ain t that the truth 
idella was lucky 
i expect she was 
where are you going 
i m just going to take these things off 
i don t know what you can do here
today  except keep me company 
then i ll see if i can make us a fire 
eat anything you want
out of the ice box 
it will all spoil  anyway 
and wipe up what you
tracked onto my floor 
what do you think i am  a mess 
mama  i ll be right out   
   when i can get down my own driveway 
stay home  boolie 
hoke is here with me 
how d he manage that 
he s very handy  i m fine 
i don t need a thing in the world 
hello  i have the wrong number 
mama s saying loving things about hoke 
i didn t say i love him 
i said he was handy 
honestly  are you trying to irritate
me in the middle of an ice storm 
thank you  wellborn 
thank you all 
i am deeply grateful to be
chosen 1966 man of the year   
   by the atlanta business council 
an honor i ve seen bestowed
on mighty fine fellows 
and one i never expected
would come to me 
i m afraid that my loss up here   
   and my gain down here   
   have given me an air of
competence that i don t possess 
i will tell you that i wish my father
and grandfather could see this 
about 72 years ago  they leased
an old mill up on decatur road   
   with i believe 25 looms in operation 
they managed to grow with atlanta 
and werthan industries believes that
what we want is what atlanta wants 
and this award proves
that we were right 
i thank you 
well 
what is it  what took you so long 
i couldn t help it 
there s a big mess up yonder 
what s the matter  i might as
well not go to temple at all 
no  ma am  you ain t going to get to
the temple this morning  miss daisy 
why not  what s the matter with you 
somebody has bombed the temple 
what  bombed the temple 
that s how come
we stuck here so long 
i don t believe it 
that s what the policeman just said 
oh  my god  was anybody there 
were people hurt 
i don t know  he didn t say 
who would do such a thing 
you know good as me  miss daisy 
it always be the same ones 
i remember one time back
down there in macon 
lord  i couldn t ve been more than
10 or 11 years old  i reckon 
i had this friend named porter 
one day there his daddy
was hanging from a tree 
now just the day before  we d
all been pitching horseshoes 
laughing and carrying on and
talking about how me and porter   
   was going to have strong
right arms  just like him 
lord  there he was 
hanging up yonder in the tree 
had his hand tied behind him 
flies was all over him 
i tell you  i threw up
where i was standing 
you go on and cry 
i m not crying 
why did you tell me that story 
lord  i don t know  miss daisy 
that mess back there
put me in mind of it 
ridiculous  the temple
has nothing to do with it 
yes  ma am  if you say so 
we don t know  maybe that
policeman wasn t telling the truth 
why would he go and lie
about a thing like that 
you never get things right 
miss daisy  somebody done bombed
that temple and you know it 
i don t want to hear anymore about it 
  you the boss 
  don t talk to me 
  where are you 
  up here 
hello  mama  how are you feeling 
not a good question to
ask somebody nearly 90 
well  you look fine 
it s my ageless appeal 
miss mcclatchey gave me your message 
florine is invited  too 
thank you 
i guess hoke should drive us 
there ll be a crowd 
mama  we have to talk about this 
about what 
about the feasibility of all this 
i believe martin luther king has
done some mighty fine things 
if you don t want to go 
why don t you just say so 
i want to go  you know
how i feel about him 
of course  but florine   
florine has nothing to do with it 
i still have to do business here 
i see  werthan bag will go out of
business if you attend the king dinner 
not exactly  but a lot of men i do
business with would not like it 
they might   
   snicker a little 
call me martin luther
werthan behind my back 
maybe i wouldn t hear
about meetings at the club 
old jack raphael at ideal mills  he s a
new york jew instead of a georgia jew 
all the really smart ones come
from new york  don t they 
some might throw their business to jack
instead of old martin luther werthan 
i don t know 
maybe it wouldn t happen 
and sometimes that s
the way things work 
anyway  if we don t use those
seats  somebody else will 
if we do not use those seats 
i m not supposed to go  either 
you can do whatever you want 
thanks for your permission 
can i ask you something 
when did you get so fired up about
martin luther king 
why  boolie 
i ve never been prejudiced
in my life and you know it 
then ask hoke to go with you 
don t be ridiculous  he wouldn t go 
ask him and see 
all right 
boolie said the silliest
thing the other day 
what did he say 
he was talking about martin luther ling 
i guess you know him  don t you 
king  no  ma am 
i don t know him 
i was sure you did 
but you ve heard him preach 
yes  ma am  same way you have 
on the tv 
i think he s wonderful 
  what you getting at 
  it s so silly 
boolie says you wanted to go with me
to this dinner  did you tell him that 
no  i didn t 
i didn t think so  what d be the point 
you can hear him whenever you want 
i think it s wonderful the
way things are changing 
now what you think
i am  miss daisy 
what do you mean 
the invitation to this dinner   
   came in the mail a month ago 
now  if did be you wanted
me to go with you   
   how come you wait  till we in the
car on the way before you asked me 
what  all i said was boolie
said you wanted to go 
next time you want me to go
somewhere ask me regular 
you don t have to carry on so much 
let s just leave it alone 
honestly 
talk about things changing 
they ain t changed all that much 
i ll help you 
thank you  hoke  i can help myself 
   can see that the south
has marvelous possibilities 
yet in spite of these assets   
   segregation has placed the south   
   socially  educationally  and
economically behind the rest of the nation 
yet there are in the white south
millions of people of good will   
   whose voices are yet unheard   
   whose course is yet unclear   
   and whose courageous
acts are yet unseen 
these millions are called upon   
   to gird their courage 
to speak out   
   to offer leadership that is needed 
history will have to record   
   that the greatest tragedy of
this period of social transition   
   was not the vitriolic words and the
violent actions of the bad people   
   but the appalling silence and
indifference of the good people 
and our generation
will have to repent   
   not only for the words and acts
of the children of darkness   
   but also for the fears and
apathy of the children of light
