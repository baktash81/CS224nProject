that will happen as they get on

too much there is the problem
i want you to understand something
my mother is a little high strung
the fact is you would
be working for me
she can say anything she likes
but she cant fire you understand
yes sir
yes sir i sure do
dont worry mr werthan
ill hold on no matter
which way she run me
i was a little boy back on the farm
above macon where i come from
i wrestled hogs to the
ground during killing time
well sir there aint a
hog got away from me yet
how are you idella
living
wheres the new vacuum cleaner
in the closet
she wont touch it
it gives me a shock
every time im near it
it works for me
good then you clean and ill
go down and run your office
wheres mama
up yonder
i guess you know who this is
ill be right back
i wouldnt be in your shoes
if the sweet lord jesus came
down and asked me himself
good morning mama
just come down and say hello
you listen here
unless they rewrote the constitution
and didnt tell me i still have rights
of course
what i do not want and absolutely
will not have is
some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen
gobbling my food using my phone
i hate that in my house
you have idella
idellas different
shes been coming to me for years
we stay out of each others way
even so there are chips
in my wedding china
you think idella has a vendetta
against your wedding china
dont be sassy
when we couldnt afford them
we did for ourselves
thats still the best way
them afford them
you sound like governor talmadge
what a thing to say
im not prejudiced
arent you ashamed
you might as well make the best of it
i knew a miss idella once
back down in macon
you dont say
she sang
what are you talking about
im talking about this
woman had some lungs
shed be a whole church
choir by herself
i declare
fat too
she was as big as that stove
dont talk to idella
she has work to do
what are you doing
dusting the bulbs miss daisy
thats the silliest thing i ever saw
who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty
get down from there
put that ladder away
before somebody trips
im gone miss daisy
all right idella see you tomorrow
im going too miss daisy
good
good morning miss daisy
thought id see after your zinnias
leave me flower bed alone
you got a nice piece of ground behind
the garage that aint doing nothing
i could put in tomatoes
if i want a vegetable garden
ill plant it myself
what are you doing
i just love a house with
pictures miss daisy
it do make a home
i dont want you nosing
through my things
good morning miss daisy
it was right cold in the night
i wouldnt know i was asleep
idella says were
running short on coffee
and dutch cleanser
we are
yes maam
were low on silver polish too
i know
im fixing to go to the
piggly wiggly on the trolley
on the trolley
why dont you let me carry you
no thank you
aint that why mr werthan hired me
thats his problem
all right but im going to
find something to do here
you leave my things alone
im gone to the market idella
miss daisy its a shame
you have this fine hudson
automobile out there in the garage
it hasnt moved an inch from
when mr werthan drove it here
that insurance company gave you
a brand new car for nothing
thats your opinion
my other opinion is that a fine rich
jewish lady like yourself
has no business dragging herself
onto a trolley carrying grocery bags
ill carry them for you
i dont need you
i dont want you
and dont say im rich
i wont say it no more
is that what you and idella talk about
i hate being discussed behind
my back in my own house
i was born on forsyth street
believe me i know
the value of a penny
my brother brought
home a white cat once
we couldnt keep it because
we couldnt afford to feed it
my sister saved up money
so i could become a teacher
we had nothing
but youre doing all right now
what are you doing
im trying to drive you to the store
where are you off to this
morning miss werthan
just a little shopping
go away ive ridden the trolley
with the groceries plenty of times
but i cant keep taking
mr werthans money for doing nothing
how much he pay you
miss daisy thats between him and me
anything over 7 a week
is highway robbery
you sure are right about that
especially since i dont do nothing
but sit on a stool all day
all right
piggly wiggly
then home nowhere else
oh i just love the smell of a new car
dont you miss daisy
i am nobodys fool hoke
i know
my husband taught me to run a car
i remember everything he said
so dont think even for a second you
wait youre speeding
i can see it
we only going 19 miles an hour
i like to go under the speed limit
but the speed limit is 35 here
the slower you go the more gas you save
my husband taught me that
aint hardly moving
might as well walk
to piggly wiggly
is this your car
no
do you pay for the gas
no
all right then
my son thinks im losing my abilities
but i am still in control
of what goes on in my car
where are you going
to the store like you said
why didnt you turn on highland
piggly wiggly aint on highland
i know where it is
now take highland avenue
thats 3 blocks out of the way
go back this minute
i cant turn now
ive been driving to piggly wiggly
since it opened for business
this isnt the way
go back this minute
miss daisy look yonder

but shes all right shes in the store
oh lord she just looked
out the window and seen me

i knew there was something funny
they all take things you know
so i counted
the silverware first
then the linen napkins
and then i went into the pantry

caught my eye was a hole
behind the lima beans
and i knew right away
there are only 8 cans of salmon

3 for 1 on sale
very clever mama
i missed my breakfast and
im late to a meeting

i tell him exactly what it is
like children if they want
something they just take it
hell never admit this

like living with no privacy
go ahead defend him

i had never seen the ocean
papa said it was the gulf of mexico not
the ocean but it was all the same to me
i asked papa if it was all right
for me to dip my hand in the water
and he laughed because i was so timid
and then i tasted the
salt water on my fingers

what folks remember

i delivered milk for the dairy
aint nothing to it
other folks are banging into each
other like theyre in the funny papers
i figured your stove was out so
i stopped by the krispy kreme
i know you got to have
coffee in the morning
how sweet of you hoke
we aint had any good coffee
around here since idella passed
i can fix her biscuits
we both can make her fried chicken
but nobody can make idellas coffee
aint that the truth
idella was lucky
i expect she was
where are you going
im just going to take these things off
i dont know what you can do here
today except keep me company
then ill see if i can make us a fire
eat anything you want
out of the ice box
it will all spoil anyway
and wipe up what you
tracked onto my floor
what do you think i am a mess
mama ill be right out
when i can get down my own driveway
stay home boolie
hoke is here with me
howd he manage that
hes very handy im fine
i dont need a thing in the world
hello i have the wrong number
mamas saying loving things about hoke
i didnt say i love him
i said he was handy
honestly are you trying to irritate
me in the middle of an ice storm
thank you wellborn
thank you all
i am deeply grateful to be
chosen 1966 man of the year
by the atlanta business council
an honor ive seen bestowed
on mighty fine fellows
and one i never expected
would come to me
im afraid that my loss up here
and my gain down here
have given me an air of
competence that i dont possess
i will tell you that i wish my father
and grandfather could see this
about 72 years ago they leased
an old mill up on decatur road
with i believe 25 looms in operation
they managed to grow with atlanta
and werthan industries believes that
what we want is what atlanta wants
and this award proves
that we were right
i thank you
well
what is it what took you so long
i couldnt help it
theres a big mess up yonder
whats the matter i might as
well not go to temple at all
no maam you aint going to get to
the temple this morning miss daisy
why not whats the matter with you
somebody has bombed the temple
what bombed the temple
thats how come
we stuck here so long
i dont believe it
thats what the policeman just said
oh my god was anybody there
were people hurt
i dont know he didnt say
who would do such a thing
you know good as me miss daisy
it always be the same ones
i remember one time back
down there in macon
lord i couldntve been more than
10 or 11 years old i reckon
i had this friend named porter
one day there his daddy
was hanging from a tree
now just the day before wed
all been pitching horseshoes
laughing and carrying on and
talking about how me and porter
was going to have strong
right arms just like him
lord there he was
hanging up yonder in the tree
had his hand tied behind him
flies was all over him
i tell you i threw up
where i was standing
you go on and cry
im not crying
why did you tell me that story
lord i dont know miss daisy
that mess back there
put me in mind of it
ridiculous the temple
has nothing to do with it
yes maam if you say so
we dont know maybe that
policeman wasnt telling the truth
why would he go and lie
about a thing like that
you never get things right
miss daisy somebody done bombed
that temple and you know it
i dont want to hear anymore about it
you the boss
dont talk to me
where are you
up here
hello mama how are you feeling
not a good question to
ask somebody nearly 90
well you look fine
its my ageless appeal
miss mcclatchey gave me your message
florine is invited too
thank you
i guess hoke should drive us
therell be a crowd
mama we have to talk about this
about what
about the feasibility of all this
i believe martin luther king has
done some mighty fine things
if you dont want to go
why dont you just say so
i want to go you know
how i feel about him
of course but florine
florine has nothing to do with it
i still have to do business here
i see werthan bag will go out of
business if you attend the king dinner
not exactly but a lot of men i do
business with would not like it
they might
snicker a little
call me martin luther
werthan behind my back
maybe i wouldnt hear
about meetings at the club
old jack raphael at ideal mills hes a
new york jew instead of a georgia jew
all the really smart ones come
from new york dont they
some might throw their business to jack
instead of old martin luther werthan
i dont know
maybe it wouldnt happen
and sometimes thats
the way things work
anyway if we dont use those
seats somebody else will
if we do not use those seats
im not supposed to go either
you can do whatever you want
thanks for your permission
can i ask you something
when did you get so fired up about
martin luther king
why boolie
ive never been prejudiced
in my life and you know it
then ask hoke to go with you
dont be ridiculous he wouldnt go
ask him and see
all right
boolie said the silliest
thing the other day
what did he say
he was talking about martin luther ling
i guess you know him dont you
king no maam
i dont know him
i was sure you did
but youve heard him preach
yes maam same way you have
on the tv
i think hes wonderful
what you getting at
its so silly
boolie says you wanted to go with me
to this dinner did you tell him that
no i didnt
i didnt think so whatd be the point
you can hear him whenever you want
i think its wonderful the
way things are changing
now what you think
i am miss daisy
what do you mean
the invitation to this dinner
came in the mail a month ago
now if did be you wanted
me to go with you
how come you wait till we in the
car on the way before you asked me
what all i said was boolie
said you wanted to go
next time you want me to go
somewhere ask me regular
you dont have to carry on so much
lets just leave it alone
honestly
talk about things changing
they aint changed all that much
ill help you
thank you hoke i can help myself
can see that the south
has marvelous possibilities
yet in spite of these assets
segregation has placed the south
socially educationally and
economically behind the rest of the nation
yet there are in the white south
millions of people of good will
whose voices are yet unheard
whose course is yet unclear
and whose courageous
acts are yet unseen
these millions are called upon
to gird their courage
to speak out
to offer leadership that is needed
history will have to record
that the greatest tragedy of
this period of social transition
was not the vitriolic words and the
violent actions of the bad people
but the appalling silence and
indifference of the good people
and our generation
will have to repent
not only for the words and acts
of the children of darkness
but also for the fears and
apathy of the children of light
