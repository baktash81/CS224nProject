huh
gasps
oh
got any ideas
ive got a few actually
okay
thats the heart
of the superweapon
and if you look closely
you can see
that its powered
by air pressure
moisture around
a composite volcano
instantly vaporizes
sending a plume
of highly pressurized steam
to the surface
that steam is contained
by the pressure chamber
and thats the part
we need to destroy
only problem is
its surrounded by armed guards
bomb do you think you can
take out those guards
some of them look
kind of tough
it wont be easy
gun cocks
yeah right
of course got it
great
chuck i need you
to disable
the security cameras

youre from one side
of the tracks
and i live on the other
why we dont see eyetoeye
really aint no wonder
but you got the rock
and i got the roll
you got the heart
and i got the soul
so lets just be friends
aint gotta fight about it
lets find our way around it
lets just be friends
hey what do you say
if we dont even know
what we were fussin about
dont you think its time
we work it out
lets just be friends
hey lets just be friends
yeah were pretty good alone
but i bet that together
we could make some noise this
town would talk about forever
weve been back and forth
and pickin sides
when you aint wrong
and i aint right
so lets just be friends
aint gotta fight about it
lets find our way around it
lets just be friends
hey what do you say
if we dont even know
what we were fussin about
dont you think its time
we work it out
lets just be friends
hey lets just be friends
youre big city
and im small town
the best of both worlds is
what it sounds like
lets just be friends
aw lets just be friends
lets just be friends
aint gotta fight about it
lets find our way around it
lets just be friends
hey what do you say
if we dont even know what
we were fussin about
