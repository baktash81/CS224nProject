when things are this easy 
some dramatically
unexpected setback occurs 
  i don t get it 
  me neither 
well  it s kind
of hard to explain 
but it s sort of like 
you know how some    
oh  see  like that 
are you freaking
kidding me 
leonard  each of you has
been selected because
you re the best
in your field 
  all  oh 
  leonard  that we could find 
all 
oh 
your skills will be
put to the test
facing this 
as you can clearly see 
this is a vol   
volcano 
 a volcano  is what
my assistant
was going to say 
  you re the assistant 
  let go  let go 
  no  i m the leader 
  i ll take that 
 clears throat  actually 
it s a composite volcano 
you can tell
by the height
and the apparent
vent clusters 
okay  forget i said  volcano  
this is a   
it s a super weapon 
 all gasp 
weird  because it looks
just like a volcano 
yep  and here s
the scary part

we re looking at  folks 
step one  travel undetected
to eagle island 
  hmm 
  uh huh 
step two  we re gonna break
into the super weapon 
  got it 
  yeah  yeah  yeah 
and step three 
ooh  ooh 
deactivate the superweapon 
once we break in there   
silver  whispers  
no plan   
hopefully  before both islands
are destroyed and we all die 
so that s  uh    that s it 
right  so i just have
a few questions 
why  i explained everything 
it s a foolproof plan 
yeah  how do we sneak
onto the island 
what is the super weapon
and how do we deactivate it 
and when you say  escape  
how do you plan to do that 
this is a crucial
thing to figure out 
i agree 
why isn t she in charge 
told you she s super smart 
hey  guys 
hold on a second  please 
  mighty eagle 
  what  what are you looking at 
do you have
an eagle island map

 gasps 
oh 
got any ideas 
i ve got a few  actually 
okay 
that s the heart
of the super weapon 
and if you look closely 
you can see
that it s powered
by air pressure 
moisture around
a composite volcano
instantly vaporizes 
sending a plume
of highly pressurized steam
to the surface 
that steam is contained
by the pressure chamber 
and that s the part
we need to destroy 
only problem is 
it s surrounded by armed guards 
bomb  do you think you can
take out those guards 
some of them look
kind of tough 
  it won t be easy 
   gun cocks 
yeah  right 
of course  got it 
great 
chuck  i need you
