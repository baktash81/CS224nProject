hey  you took a bullet 
yeah  but i want you to know
i take full responsibility
for what happened
to the professor 
plummer was the best
security expert
the department of defense
ever had 
he was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called  ghost  
guided high altitude
scrambling transmitter 
one pulse from a ghost satellite
and a country can t launch
its own nukes 
that s why the serbians
kidnapped him 
they must have thought that
ghost was in that briefcase 
ghost is still out there 
which is why i m sending you
back in 
i know you ve never lost anybody
before  shane 
i was with your father
when he led a platoon   
with all due respect 
i d appreciate it if we kept
my father out of this 
all i m saying is that it
happens to the best of them 
and you re the best 
i need someone i can trust on this
  and i know i can trust you 
  okay 
i ll put a team together 
no  it s not
that kind of mission 
this is at the top of the pentagon s
priority list 
two days ago 
i got a call from admiral blair 
it seems that the professor s widow
contacted him 
whoever killed her husband
must think that ghost
is still in that house 
now  maybe it is  maybe it isn t 
a safety deposit box has been discovered
in zurich in the plummers  name 
i ve been assigned to escort mrs 
plummer there to retrieve the contents

habit for a guy in the military

once upon a time 
there was a family   
   of elves 
and one day the little elf family
went into the magic forest
to find a secret   
   gnome   
   facility 
where the gnomes were
turning mushrooms into uranium 
so three elves laid down heavy
suppressive fire on the gnomes
while the others maneuvered
around to the right flank 
finishing off anything left alive 
and not one of those elves
were left behind that day 
we got  em all 
even the teeniest   
   littlest elf of all
