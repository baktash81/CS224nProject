to the professor
plummer was the best
security expert
the department of defense
ever had
he was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called ghost
guided highaltitude
scrambling transmitter
one pulse from a ghost satellite
and a country cant launch
its own nukes
thats why the serbians
kidnapped him
they must have thought that
ghost was in that briefcase
ghost is still out there
which is why im sending you
back in
i know youve never lost anybody
before shane
i was with your father
when he led a platoon
with all due respect
id appreciate it if we kept
my father out of this
all im saying is that it
happens to the best of them

no its not
that kind of mission
this is at the top of the pentagons
priority list
two days ago
i got a call from admiral blair

contacted him
whoever killed her husband

is still in that house

suppressive fire on the gnomes
