   to remind us that time is luck 
so don t waste it
living someone else s life 
make yours count for something

dad 
this is not how i imagined
i would die 
looking at my son   
   and seeing a stranger 
you have such potential  harry 
such fierce intelligence   
   and you re throwing it all away 
no  you threw me away 
you kicked me off to boarding school
when i was 11 
on my 16th birthday   
   you sent me scotch 
or one of your assistants did 
i m pretty sure because the card read 
 with compliments  norman osborn   
i don t expect forgiveness from you   
   anymore 
i don t believe in miracles 
how could you possibly understand   
   that your childhood
had to be sacrificed   
   for something greater 
and not just for me 
for you 
has your hand started to twitch yet 
when you lay awake
and you feel it coming   
   hiding under your skin   
   waiting to show itself 
to show you   
   who you really are 
retroviral hyperplasia 
i never told you   
   that it s genetic 
our disease   
   the osborn curse 
and it began at your age 
let me see it 
your hand  give it to me 
the greatest inheritance
i can give you   
   isn t merely money 
it s this 
the sum total of all my work 
everything i did to stay alive 
maybe you can succeed   
   where i failed 
norman osborn  the legendary founder
and ceo of oscorp industries  has died   
   the osborn estate has confirmed 
he is survived by his only son 
harry osborn   
   who is the sole heir
of the oscorp corporate empire 
harry 
osborn changed the medical profession s
approach to human healing   
   and affected the lives of millions 
i started oscorp because i looked at
the world around me and i thought 
 we can do better 
and we should do better   
einstein said   the world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking   
but change isn t just a slogan 
it begins with hard work 
change begins with
persistence and commitment 
mr  osborn changed the world 
and now it s up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive 
but not today 
today is for mourning 
  hello 
  is this gwen stacy 
yes  it is  who s calling 
i m calling from the oxford scholars
program  we have some exciting news

harry   
   oscorp s been under
intense public scrutiny   
   in the wake of dr  connors  recent   
   breach of trust 
you mean people are pissed off   
   because he tried to turn everyone
in new york city into giant lizards 
given that   
   all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed   
   to restore investor confidence 
that is the osborn way 
whatever s inconvenient around here 
just get rid of it  right 
much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now 
we felt that plausible deniability
was your best option 
sure  sure  i get it 
twenty year old kid 
two hundred billion dollar company 
what was dad thinking 
i mean  you re all lawyers  right 
surely  someone must ve questioned
his sanity in the end 
someone must ve thought about
having him declared legally incompetent 
it would ve made this conversation
a lot easier 
  harry   
  it s mr  osborn 
we re not friends 
hi

everything about this place 
i guess that kind of included you 
you ain t gotta explain anything

we both got dumped 
you ever figure out
why your parents bailed 
my dad left a briefcase

who was he 
maxwell dillon  electrical engineer 
no associates or friends to speak of 
he submitted specs for the grid

the guy was   
   invisible 
wall street s nervous enough
with that child  harry  taking over 
we ve gotta find a way to get him out 
in the meantime  if the press gets hold
of this accident  our stock will crater 
so make sure this mr  dillon
stays invisible 
this could prove useful for us
in the future

spider man 
england 
really 
good talk 
our coverage of this breaking story   
   begins with new york 1  s
jessica abo at the scene 
that s right  we re standing here
with two eyewitnesses   
   who are going to tell us
what they just saw 
tell us  how do you think
spider man did it 
how do you think
he beat this creature 
yeah  it s gotta be rubberized 
spidey s suit 
that s why he didn t get electrocuted 
probably some kind of neoprene 
that s what i d use 
thank you very much
to the two of you 
as you can tell  so many questions
remain unanswered 
we will bring you the latest information
as it becomes available 
for now  jessica abo  new york 1 
let s send it back to you 
online polls show a sudden uptick   
   in public sentiment
in favor of the web crawler 
tonight  it would seem new york city
owes him a debt of gratitude

welcome to dr  jallings 
science investigator 
today we re going to be
talking about electricity 
batteries  insulators 
electromagnetic currents 
batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges 
the more powerful the battery 
the bigger the charge it can withstand 
but if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge   
   the battery might explode

when doing experiments like this 
always wear protective gear 
you re not invincible 
we re gonna need a bigger battery 
  hello 
  pete 
it s me 
hey  harry  what    
what time is it 
late  early  i don t know 
i ve been up all night 
i need to see you 
you all right 
not really  pete 
i m dying 
but i think you can help
save my life 
you re looking at the world s first
human spider hybrids 
the hope is to extract the venom
from their glands   
   and turn that into a cure 
an agent that heals diseased cells 
and if i can be cured  imagine what
this could do for other diseases   
   like alzheimer s  even cancer 
they never made it to human trials 
it s 14 years of research 
and nothing to show for it 
except maybe this 
spider man 
what about him 
he was bitten by one of those things 
and it worked 
i don t know how
and i don t know why   
   but he can do everything else
a spider can   
   including self heal 
i need to find him 
i need his blood 
you need   
   spider man s blood 
it ll save my life 
it may not  har 
it may not be that simple 
you saw what happened
to curt connors  right 
connors was weak 
this is me  peter 
i don t think you can just set up a van   
   and have him donate 
i mean  i m sure he s sensitive about
people shoving needles and   
he s sensitive  okay 
well  then  maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is   
   and i will go ask him myself 
what 
  you took his picture 
  so 
  you know him 
  harry 
i took a picture from a long way away 
i used a long lens 
i don t know him 
i put together what you said
at the river 
  what i   
  about how he gives people hope 
come on 
what in the    
just say yes 
don t turn your back on me 
i don t wanna end up
like my father  peter 
please 
peter  please 
i can t

i m gonna try   
   and find spider man 
  hey  what s security doing over here

come here 
she s not here  check another floor 
  got it 
  yes  sir 
you re in trouble 
  yeah 
  who s that guy 
there was an accident in the genomics
lab  and they re covering it up 
and i found out  that guy
from times square last night 
i met him  he was an electrical
engineer in the building 
and he loved spider man  by the way 
he was  like  a fanatic 
i didn t get love vibes  i got more of
a  want to kill me with his electricity  vibe 
that s actually kind of what it s like
to love you 
i was searching for him in the computer
and all the files  he s erased 
  my god 
  he s completely erased 
that s oscorp 
and what about you  why are you here 
harry 
  osborn 
  he s dying 
  what do you mean 
  he s dying 
and he thinks the only thing
that s gonna save his life   
   is my blood  is spider man s blood 
and as far as i know  if i
give it to him  it could kill him 
or something worse 
i know 
this is the maintenance closet  gwen 
this is the most clichéd hiding place
you could ve chosen 
  this is the stupidest hiding place 
  i m sorry   
   i didn t take us to the bahamas
of hiding places 
i gotta talk to you about england 
i guess  because i don t

you are correct 
i m here to study you 
to understand what you are 
why you are 
und i will get results

your uncle ben and i 
i mean  who else was gonna care for you 
and protect you and worry about you 
your father

and made you brush your teeth   
   and do your homework 
or washed your dirty underwear  me 
your stupid  non scientific aunt  who
doesn t know how to make ends meet   
   who has to take nursing classes   
   with 22 year old kids so i can
pay for you to go to college

a few days after the funeral   
   two government men came to see us 
they said the genetics research   
   that your father was doing with
norman osborn was very valuable   
   and that people
would pay a lot for it 
and that s why he ran off with it 
they said he was a traitor 
i couldn t believe it  peter 
they told us he betrayed
his best friend  all of us   
   for the money 
i don t   
oh  i don t get it  no  i don t   
this doesn t make sense 
yes  i know  i know  i didn t
believe it either  i didn t believe it 
it doesn t make any sense 
peter  i don t know 
for so long  i would play it over
and over and over in my head 
what had i missed 
what had i missed 
he was just this
normal  unassuming guy 
he wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years 
he took the d train to work
at 7 every morning 
came home at 6 every night 
i don t know 
maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide 
even from the people they love 
peter 
peter

i really  really do 
i can t give you my blood 
not right now 
excuse me 
it s too dangerous 
if our blood is incompatible 
you could die 
i m already dying 
your blood can t make me die more 
but it could do something worse 
okay

  how much what 
  how much do you want  name it 
you want a boat  you want a plane  you
want money  how much do you want 
  i don t want your money

  i m trying to protect you right now 
  no  no  you are not 
you re trying to protect yourself 
look  we just need a bit more time

roosevelt away from the public eye   
   to keep his polio hidden
from the american people   
mr  osborn 
you all right 
is there anything i can get you 
no  not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life 
spiders 
the ones that they destroyed   
    to restore investor confidence   
go home  felicia 
take the day off 
harry 
i think there may be another way
to get what you re looking for 
i overheard menken talking
with one of our security heads 
before they destroyed the spiders   
   they had the venom extracted 
what 
what are you saying 
that way  they could comply
with the lawsuits   
   but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful 
where is it 
it s somewhere in the building 
it s somewhere off books
called  special projects

warning 
your user access has been revoked 
he s busy  you can t go in there 
he s busy 
what did you do 
the more relevant question is
what did you do 
an employee is killed and in your
first action as ceo  you cover it up 
no  you covered it up  then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name 
ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement 
you are experimenting
on people in there 
progress has its stepping stones 
now  in light of your deceptive
criminal actions  you ve been   
how do i put this gently 
   fired 
you are not going to bury me too 
looks to me like you re
halfway in the ground already 
it s only a matter of time 
you re going to die a horrible death 
like your father 
the difference is   
   no one is going to miss you 
get him out 
wait  wait 
i know my way out 
a hundred dollars 
can you believe that 
tell you why  you should
put the lid on that but quick 
i tried  good luck 
you should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators 
test 
my name is richard parker 
whatever lies will be told about me   
   i would like the world
to know the truth 
oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research   
   when norman osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization   
   to continue funding my research 
and i discovered what
they were going to use it for 
weapons  biological weapons 
of course 
so i refused 
and now  to eliminate me
from the picture   
   norman osborn has
falsified evidence against me   
   in order to take control
of my work 
can i help you 
yeah  you can open the gate 
i m harry osborn 
now  there s a patient in that
isolation wing that i need to see 
joe  this is mr  osborn of oscorp 
sorry  without a yellow badge 
i can t let anyone past this point 
but it doesn t matter
because there s something else   
   that norman doesn t know 
the human dna   
   that i implanted in the spiders   
   was my own 
which means that without me   
   without my bloodline   
   oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments 
keep electro incubated   
   with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital 
i have destroyed as much as possible
from the archives 
but i didn t have time
to kill all of the spiders 
so as a scientist 
my choice is very clear now 
i have to disappear  i have to get
as far away from here as i can 
but as a father   
   it means i may not
see my boy again 
and nothing is as important to me   
   as my son  peter 
nothing in this world 
but i have a responsibility   
   to protect the world
from what i ve created   
   and to protect him from
what i know osborn is capable of 
people will say i am a monster   
   for what i ve done 
and maybe they re right 
i always thought that i d have more   
   time 
dad  dad 
i m sorry 
sedation off 
i m gonna get you out of here 
all right 
but we don t have much time 
who are you 
i m harry osborn 
i wanna make you a deal 
i should kill you 
oh  come on 
think bigger  max 
i m not the one you want 
you want spider man 
and i can give him to you 
but i need something first 
i need you to get me into oscorp 
get you in 
you own it 
not anymore 
oscorp betrayed us both   
   so i can t get in there without you
and you can t get out of here without me 
  what s happening 
  someone pulled an alarm in the iso unit 
get a containment team up there now 
you couldn t possibly know
what i want 
you submitted the design for the grid   
   and they stole it 
and now you want it back 
you just wanna take back
what s yours 
  how 
  it is all the power in the city  max   
   and it s right at your fingertips 
and then once you shut down
the grid   
   spider man will come to you 
and i want you to make him bleed 
break it  break it 
max  we don t have much time 
go  go  go  go 
give me one reason
why i should trust you 
because i need you 
you need me 
yes  i need you 
you are my only chance
that i have at surviving 
you need me 
yes  i need you 
i need you  please  please 
please 
i know what it s like to be thrown away 
please  max 
i need you  i need you 
no 
you wanna be my friend 
i thought we were already friends 
i had a friend once 
it didn t work out 
yeah  me too 
then let s go catch a spider 
you have one new voice message 
hi  peter  it s me 
i got in to oxford 
it s very exciting 
i came by your house a little bit ago
and i   
you weren t there   
   and so i m on my way
to the airport right now   
   because there s this early
summer class that i found out about   
   and i thought that
it would somehow   
   be easier  i guess  this way 
i think that maybe it s time   
   to let this go 
and that s not because
i don t love you 
it s actually because i do  so   
okay  bye 
  we have to move  now 
  why  what s happened 
remember me 
oh  my  oh  my 
how the tables have turned 
i know it s hard to admit   
   but how spectacular a move is this 
  am i right 
  right as rain 
okay  so  fairy godmother   
   it is time to grant me a wish 
  i want in to special   
  how dare you come back in here 
you recalcitrant  unworthy  defective   
   urchin freaks 
oh  god  i m sorry  that s just not
the answer we were looking for 
clear 
welcome back to the bonus round 
hey  let s take a walk  shall we 
the grid is all yours 
the spider venom  give it to me 
what is all this stuff 
the future 
load one up 
it won t work 
we ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials 
you ve actually already run human trials 
you re just too stupid to know it 
do it  now

you ve made progress 
i ve identified several
worthy candidates 
now that spider man s gone   
   this city will never be the same 
oh  i m counting on that 
speaking of progress   
   you re looking better 
it comes and goes 
tell me more 
how many men did you have in mind 
i wanna keep it small 
everything you need
is already at oscorp 
access granted 
welcome  mr  fiers 
who s our first volunteer 
aleksei sytsevich 
currently serving a life sentence 
he is   
   most eager to join us 
good 
start with him 
russian gangster aleksei sytsevich   
   was broken out of
a classified penitentiary   
   known simply as the vault
by an unknown team of men 
it s yet another example
of increased criminal activity   
   since the disappearance
of spider man five months ago 
the web slinger s absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city 
believe it or not  even the new
york city police department   
   has joined the chorus
of new yorkers in hoping   
   for the return of the web slinger 
the entire world seems to be
asking the same question 
where is spider man 
too bad about that spider guy 
too bad he s disappeared 
seems like everybody really needs him 
where you going 
  eat my cereal 
  peter 
where you going 
i don t know 
you know  it s so funny 
i ve been   
i ve been trying to clean up
around here  get organized   
   and been putting
some of ben s stuff in boxes 
and it s so funny  the heavier
the box gets  the lighter i feel 
  you re throwing his stuff away 
  no 
no  god  no 
i couldn t do that  it s part of me 
i m just finding   
   a better place for it 
i m gonna take one last look   
   and i m gonna put it
where it belongs 
it s easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today 
but there will be dark days
ahead of us too 
there will be days
where you feel all alone 
and that s when hope is needed most 
no matter how buried it gets   
   or how lost you feel   
   you must promise me   
   that you will hold on to hope 
keep it alive 
we have to be greater
than what we suffer 
my wish for you   
   is to become hope 
people need that 
and even if we fail   
   what better way is there to live 
as we look around here today   
   at all of the people
who helped make us who we are   
   i know it feels like
we re saying goodbye 
but we will carry
a piece of each other   
   into everything that we do next   
   to remind us of who we are   
   and of who we re meant to be 
i ve had a great four years with you 
i ll miss you all very much 
let s go  move it 
get down  take cover 
i m here live on park avenue and
56th street where it is complete chaos 
a man in some sort of
weaponized armored suit   
   is wreaking havoc on midtown 
i am the rhino 
i told you i would be back 
  no  no 
  a kid 
hold your fire 
everybody  hold your fire 
  unit 2  stand down  stand down 
  civilian in our line of sight 
kid  you gotta get

you go take care of your mom  okay 
all right  get out of here  go  go 
you fight me

on behalf of the fine people of new
york city and real rhinos everywhere   
   i ask you to put
your mechanized paws in the air 
never 
i crush you  i kill you  i destroy you
