its better this way
dad
this is not how i imagined
i would die
looking at my son
and seeing a stranger
you have such potential harry
such fierce intelligence
and youre throwing it all away
no you threw me away
you kicked me off to boarding school
when i was 11
on my 16th birthday
you sent me scotch
or one of your assistants did
im pretty sure because the card read
with compliments norman osborn
i dont expect forgiveness from you
anymore
i dont believe in miracles
how could you possibly understand
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed
for something greater
and not just for me
for you
has your hand started to twitch yet
when you lay awake
and you feel it coming
hiding under your skin
waiting to show itself
to show you
who you really are
retroviral hyperplasia
i never told you
that its genetic
our disease
the osborn curse
and it began at your age
let me see it
your hand give it to me
the greatest inheritance
i can give you
isnt merely money
its this
the sum total of all my work
everything i did to stay alive
maybe you can succeed
where i failed
norman osborn the legendary founder
and ceo of oscorp industries has died
the osborn estate has confirmed
he is survived by his only son
harry osborn
who is the sole heir
of the oscorp corporate empire
harry
osborn changed the medical professions
approach to human healing
and affected the lives of millions
i started oscorp because i looked at
the world around me and i thought
we can do better
and we should do better
einstein said the world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking
but change isnt just a slogan
it begins with hard work
change begins with
persistence and commitment
mr osborn changed the world
and now its up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive
but not today
today is for mourning
hello
is this gwen stacy

intense public scrutiny
in the wake of dr connors recent
breach of trust
you mean people are pissed off
because he tried to turn everyone
in new york city into giant lizards
given that
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed
to restore investor confidence
that is the osborn way
whatevers inconvenient around here
just get rid of it right
much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now
we felt that plausible deniability
was your best option
sure sure i get it
twentyyearold kid
two hundred billion dollar company
what was dad thinking
i mean youre all lawyers right
surely someone mustve questioned
his sanity in the end

welcome to dr jallings
science investigator
today were going to be
talking about electricity
batteries insulators
electromagnetic currents
batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges
the more powerful the battery
the bigger the charge it can withstand
but if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge
the battery might explode
explode
when doing experiments like this
always wear protective gear
youre not invincible
were gonna need a bigger battery
hello
pete
its me
hey harry what
what time is it
late early i dont know
ive been up all night
i need to see you
you all right
not really pete
im dying
but i think you can help
save my life
youre looking at the worlds first
humanspider hybrids
the hope is to extract the venom
from their glands
and turn that into a cure
an agent that heals diseased cells
and if i can be cured imagine what
this could do for other diseases
like alzheimers even cancer
they never made it to human trials
its 14 years of research
and nothing to show for it
except maybe this
spiderman
what about him
he was bitten by one of those things
and it worked
i dont know how
and i dont know why
but he can do everything else
a spider can
including selfheal
i need to find him
i need his blood
you need
spidermans blood
itll save my life
it may not har
it may not be that simple
you saw what happened
to curt connors right
connors was weak
this is me peter
i dont think you can just set up a van
and have him donate

people shoving needles and
hes sensitive okay

sensitively tell me where he is
and i will go ask him myself
what
you took his picture

that your father was doing with
norman osborn was very valuable

they said he was a traitor
i couldnt believe it peter

his best friend all of us
for the money
i dont
oh i dont get it no i dont
this doesnt make sense

normal unassuming guy
he wore the same ratty lab coat
for 20 years
he took the d train to work

a part of themselves they hide

track 61 a secret
subterranean extension
of new yorks d line train
under pershing square
built to transport president franklin
roosevelt away from the public eye
to keep his polio hidden
from the american people
mr osborn
you all right
is there anything i can get you
no not unless you can
bring those spiders back to life
spiders
the ones that they destroyed
to restore investor confidence
go home felicia
take the day off
harry
i think there may be another way
to get what youre looking for
i overheard menken talking
with one of our security heads
before they destroyed the spiders
they had the venom extracted
what
what are you saying
that way they could comply
with the lawsuits
but still keep the data
in case it ever became useful
where is it
its somewhere in the building
its somewhere offbooks
called special projects

warning
your user access has been revoked
hes busy you cant go in there
hes busy
what did you do
the more relevant question is
what did you do
an employee is killed and in your
first action as ceo you cover it up
no you covered it up then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name
ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement
you are experimenting
on people in there
progress has its stepping stones
now in light of your deceptive
criminal actions youve been
how do i put this gently
fired
you are not going to bury me too
looks to me like youre
halfway in the ground already
its only a matter of time
youre going to die a horrible death
like your father
the difference is
no one is going to miss you
get him out
wait wait
i know my way out
a hundred dollars
can you believe that
tell you why you should
put the lid on that but quick
i tried good luck
you should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators
test
my name is richard parker
whatever lies will be told about me
i would like the world
to know the truth
oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research
when norman osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization
to continue funding my research
and i discovered what
they were going to use it for
weapons biological weapons
of course
so i refused
and now to eliminate me
from the picture
norman osborn has
falsified evidence against me
in order to take control
of my work
can i help you
yeah you can open the gate
im harry osborn
now theres a patient in that
isolation wing that i need to see
joe this is mr osborn of oscorp
sorry without a yellow badge
i cant let anyone past this point
but it doesnt matter
because theres something else
that norman doesnt know
the human dna
that i implanted in the spiders
was my own
which means that without me
without my bloodline
oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments
keep electro incubated
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital
i have destroyed as much as possible
from the archives
but i didnt have time
to kill all of the spiders
so as a scientist
my choice is very clear now
i have to disappear i have to get
as far away from here as i can
but as a father
it means i may not
see my boy again
and nothing is as important to me
as my son peter
nothing in this world
but i have a responsibility
to protect the world
from what ive created
and to protect him from
what i know osborn is capable of
people will say i am a monster
for what ive done
and maybe theyre right
i always thought that id have more
time
dad dad
im sorry
sedation off
im gonna get you out of here
all right
but we dont have much time
who are you
im harry osborn
i wanna make you a deal
i should kill you
oh come on
think bigger max
im not the one you want
you want spiderman
and i can give him to you
but i need something first
i need you to get me into oscorp
get you in
you own it
not anymore
oscorp betrayed us both
so i cant get in there without you
and you cant get out of here without me
whats happening
someone pulled an alarm in the iso unit
get a containment team up there now
you couldnt possibly know
what i want
you submitted the design for the grid
and they stole it
and now you want it back
you just wanna take back
whats yours
how
it is all the power in the city max
and its right at your fingertips
and then once you shut down
the grid
spiderman will come to you
and i want you to make him bleed
break it break it
max we dont have much time
go go go go
give me one reason
why i should trust you
because i need you
you need me
yes i need you
you are my only chance
that i have at surviving
you need me
yes i need you
i need you please please
please
i know what its like to be thrown away
please max
i need you i need you
no
you wanna be my friend
i thought we were already friends
i had a friend once
it didnt work out

you have one new voice message
hi peter its me
i got in to oxford
its very exciting
i came by your house a little bit ago
and i
you werent there
and so im on my way
to the airport right now
because theres this early
summer class that i found out about
and i thought that
it would somehow
be easier i guess this way
i think that maybe its time
to let this go
and thats not because
i dont love you
its actually because i do so
okay bye
we have to move now
why whats happened
remember me
oh my oh my
how the tables have turned
i know its hard to admit
but how spectacular a move is this
am i right
right as rain
okay so fairy godmother
it is time to grant me a wish
i want in to special
how dare you come back in here
you recalcitrant unworthy defective
urchin freaks
oh god im sorry thats just not

hey lets take a walk shall we

speaking of progress
youre looking better
it comes and goes
tell me more
how many men did you have in mind
i wanna keep it small
everything you need
is already at oscorp
access granted
welcome mr fiers
whos our first volunteer
aleksei sytsevich
currently serving a life sentence
he is
most eager to join us
good
start with him
russian gangster aleksei sytsevich
was broken out of
a classified penitentiary
known simply as the vault
by an unknown team of men
its yet another example
of increased criminal activity
since the disappearance
of spiderman five months ago
the webslingers absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city
believe it or not even the new
york city police department
has joined the chorus
of new yorkers in hoping
for the return of the webslinger
the entire world seems to be
asking the same question
where is spiderman
too bad about that spider guy
too bad hes disappeared
seems like everybody really needs him
where you going
eat my cereal
peter
where you going
i dont know
you know its so funny
ive been
ive been trying to clean up
around here get organized
and been putting
some of bens stuff in boxes
and its so funny the heavier
the box gets the lighter i feel
youre throwing his stuff away
no
no god no
i couldnt do that its part of me
im just finding
a better place for it
im gonna take one last look
and im gonna put it
where it belongs
its easy to feel hopeful
on a beautiful day like today
but there will be dark days
ahead of us too
there will be days
where you feel all alone
and thats when hope is needed most
no matter how buried it gets
or how lost you feel
you must promise me
that you will hold on to hope
keep it alive
we have to be greater
than what we suffer
my wish for you
is to become hope
people need that
and even if we fail
what better way is there to live
as we look around here today
at all of the people
who helped make us who we are
i know it feels like
were saying goodbye
but we will carry
a piece of each other
into everything that we do next
to remind us of who we are
and of who were meant to be
ive had a great four years with you
ill miss you all very much
lets go move it
get down take cover
im here live on park avenue and
56th street where it is complete chaos

weaponized armored suit
