 in this town 
there was a place
 called the krusty krab 
 where folks would
come to eat a thing
 called the krabby patty 
 every greasy spoon
has a fry cook 
 and the one who worked here
 was named
spongebob squarepants

he loved
his best friend  patrick 
 grunts 
 laughing 
he loved blowing bubbles
and jellyfishing 
whee 
he loved making
krabby patties
for the folks of
bikini bottom
just as much
as they loved eating them 
why  you may ask 
do they love this
greasy little sandwich
so much 
why did they eat them
for breakfast

doctor s warnings 
he ll be gone in a week 
 sobbing  oh  harold

no one was sure what was
in these patties
that made them so delicious 
and  frankly 
no one cared 
except for plankton 
meh 
plankton owned a restaurant
right across the street
from the krusty krab 
where no one ate
because the food
was really bad 
now  is that
really necessary 
burger beard  plankton
had made it his life s work
to steal the recipe

i m not pretending 
i can t believe
you thought i was lying 
hey  don t take it

i just assume
everyone is lying 
that is a horrible way
to live your life 
whatever 
it is  and if we re going

when we have teamwork
  don t you think so 
my friend 
  no  tee am work
  is getting in the way
of my schee am work
  what don t you comprehend 
  but working together
is the key
  nothing s impossible
when it s you and me
  i m doing just fine
on my own
  work is no fun
when you do it alone
  if i want it done right 
i ll do it by myself
  but what if you need
something on a higher shelf 
  but i m the target
  of a very scary 
crazy post apocalyptic mob 
  well  that s exactly
why you need a partner
  helping you
with this important job

now back up 
 speaking backwards 
 rewinding 
slow down 
 slowly  not without
a time machine 
hmm 
yes 
spongebob 
you re a genius 
i am 
if we build a time machine 
we can go back to before
the formula disappeared 
before society broke down 
before we became the hunted 
that sounds great  plankton 
but how do we build
a time machine 
well  first we ll need
a computer powerful enough
to calculate the intricacies
of time travel 
where would
we get one of those 
hmm 
plankton  there she is 
my computer wife 
they ve got her tied up
in the back room 
i ve never seen this many
people at the chum bucket 
i ve never seen
anyone there 
now was that
really necessary 
cause the food s really bad 
oh  come on  really 
shh 
how are we gonna
sneak past those guards 
hmm 
 indistinct chatter 
well  what do we have here 
 all grunting 
we better hurry 
those guys really hate tires 
 grunts
