buon giorno
come please sit down
whos this
this is
father adam guiteau
father adams in charge
of our archives
a bookworm
hes familiar with all
your activities
so speak freely
tell me what happened
we cleaned out the nest
a master showed up
no master was ever like this
superhuman strength unkillable
we didnt stand a chance
so tell me cardinal
but couldnt he be the one
the one we knew would
come along one day
there are some other developments
sad developments
tom
our tom our tom callahan
hes dead
and the whole european team
is wiped out
when
three days ago
callahan was clearing
a nest near cologne germany
local authorities reported it
as a terrorist act
we found this at the site
is he the one
yes
what is this
a celebratum
its medieval latin for celebrate
celebrate this
celebrate what
we dont know
ive authenticated it
it was painted in 1340
the subjects name is was valek
jan valek born in prague 1311
he was a priest
who turned against the church
and led peasants
in an uprising
capturing several towns
valek was captured
he was tried for heresy
and burned at the stake
but after his death
he was seen walking at night
he killed the living
to drink their blood
they opened his grave
and it was found empty
its the first known case
of vampirism
a priest
valek is not like the other masters
youve hunted he is the first
and most powerful
of our slayers you are
the only one who faced valek
and survived
im going back out
you mind if i hang on to this
ive been in contact with rome
the vatican council
requests that you rebuild
your team
there isnt time
youre to return to monterey
recruit new team members
and try again when
you are at full strength
father adam will accompany you
and take the place
of poor father giovanni
i dont think so
this is nonnegotiable
valek is the original
the source of the disease
the first vampire created
by the church
by accident
shut the fuck up
this was your fight cardinal
now it is mine
if you refuse to obey the rules
the operation will be canceled
the funding withdrawn
you have any idea how
this valek knows my name
stay close to him
whats your name
do you understand
whats happened to you
help me
dont fuck with me honey
ill snap your neck like a twig
now nod your head yes or no
do you understand
whats happened to you
do it
all right
now im going to explain it to you
first im gonna take
my hand off your mouth
you scream
good
whats your name
katrina
okay katrina
heres the score
i took off your clothes
i cleaned you up
i tied you down
i also saved your ass
youve been bitten by a vampire
remember the party at the motel
big guy pointy teeth
really shitty breath
dont worry
itll come back to you
a master vampire has a telepathic
link with his victims
youre gonna help us find him
while hes sleeping
we unleash on him
youre the bait honey
sorry
i know all about you mr crow
i know your parents were
bitten by vampires
you were raised by the church
as its master slayer
the truth is i didnt want
to be forced on you
i was supposed to take over when
father giovanni retired
i always dreamed of this
ever since i first heard
about you the slayers
i want to be part of the team
just do whatever i could
for example if you
wanted to receive
the sacrament of confession
fucking priest
who set us up
was it you who set us up
who was it
was it you who set us up
i dont know what you mean
you dont think ill
kill you a priest
youre seriously misjudging me
you want to kill me
you go ahead
i dont know what youre
talking about
i dont
well see about that
where are we going
you have to tell me mr crow
you ever seen a vampire
first of all
theyre not romantic
theyre not a bunch of fags
in rented formalwear
seducing everybody with
eurotrash accents
forget what youve seen
in the movies
they dont turn into bats
crosses dont work
garlic stand there with garlic
one of them will bend you over
and walk up your strata chocolata
while sucking your blood
all right and they dont sleep
in taffetalined coffins
you wanna kill one drive a
wooden stake through his heart
sunlight turns them into
crispy critters
got it
see this map
this map shows all the encounters
in the us as far back as the 1800s
ive never seen it
no one has
look at the southwest
see the spiral pattern
timesequence the encounters you get
a logarithmic pattern everwidening
its a search pattern padre
theyre looking for something
do you know what it is
i heard stories
when i was young
something about a black cross
about vampires walking
in the sunlight
padre
can i ask you something
when i was kicking your ass
did that give you wood
you get a little mahogany
from that ebony
im just fucking with you
forget about it
and what god has given her
is that she sees
her guardian angel
oh jesus
what time is it
you want one
you gotta eat something
i cant
i wouldnt mind a cigarette
we have to work on this
the less you eat
the faster the virus moves
virus
thats what i call it
nobody knows what it really is
poison koolaid
it all does the same thing
turns you into a vampire
what happened to the other girls
they didnt make it
im sorry
so you remember now
yeah some
why doesnt anyone know
nobody wants to know
thats how vampires survive
theyre smart
they keep their numbers low
and the world never catches on
will i be one
i dont know for sure
probably
unless we find him before you turn
then maybe theres a chance
heres what we do know
youre connected to the master vampire
hes a part of you
and this link will grow
youll never get him out of you
not while he still exists
then i dont want to live
you may not

lord
i dont get this
why come all this way to attack
some old priest and a cleaning lady
valek didnt feed on either of them
father molina was a scholar of
early catholic history
whats the point
i dont know
i dont know why valek killed him
whats this
the church doesnt know
you and the cardinal
are lying sacks of shit

youre a righteous man mr crow
besides i serve a higher master
secrets are kept to protect
the church and its followers part of
open your mouth
what
open your mouth
give me your hand
you listen to me you fuck
my father kept a secret once
hed been bitten by a vampire
he kept it a secret from me
and my mother
by the fifth day he was turning
that night he attacked my mother
and then he came after me
i killed my own father padre
i got no trouble killing you
last chance
now open your mouth
open your fucking mouth
then prepare to
what you ready
excuse me
valek is looking for an ancient relic
the cross of berziers
after his trial the church
declared valek possessed
he was taken to a town
in france called berziers
an exorcism was performed
using an ancient
forbidden form of the ceremony
it was long and very brutal
something went wrong
the wooden gate is opening
the accounts are confused
but they refer to an inverse exorcism
the body is destroyed
but the possessed soul remains
valek was transformed
into a creature
whose body is dead but lives on
a vampire
a vampire
its a cross
the stories about
the black cross are true
it was used in the exorcism
and taken to rome
its known as the berziers cross
it was shipped to the new world
it was moved from
one spanish mission to another
its location was kept secret
even from the vatican
for hundreds of years it was lost
cardinal alba found the name
of the only living priest
who knew the location
father joseph molina
cardinal alba and i came to the us
to find father molina
to reclaim the berziers cross
and that is all i know
youre a good man padre
welcome to the team
god forgive me
he found it
lets hit it
wait wait stop the car
that way
it was here
you picking up anything
hes gone
you dont look good
she hasnt turned yet
she cant eat
maybe what she wants is human blood
she hasnt turned
i heard what you said
why dont you back off
whats with you
whats with me whats with you
youre being an asshole
what the fuck is your problem
youre not falling for
this halfdead
fuck
nice shot
wanna try again
stop it
get the fuck out of here
whatre you doing
were about to have
one fuck of a fight
do you know why valek
wants the cross
think about it for a minute
i think valek wants to finish
his transformation
the exorcism wasnt completed
valeks vulnerable
able to survive only at night
so if he completes the ritual
i think the balance shifts
for 600 years valek has wanted to find
a way to live in the daylight
fuck me
now with the berziers cross he will
a master vampire able to
walk in the sun unstoppable
unless we stop him
well have to finish this
some other time
we got eight hours of sun left
come on come on
come on baby
thats where he is
santiago
place looks empty
hes near
what do you figure
the population is 20
id say 30 maybe more
the question is how many are goons
our worstcase scenario half
15 dead 15 goons
valek would have been here
several days
thats right padre
he set this up slowly
one goon at a time
hes got the cross and the biggest nest
the worlds ever known
what do we got three slayers
two slayers
its time to kill some vampires
you with us padre
yeah im with you
their location
where is he
everywhere
katrina baby listen
is he in there
yes
hes in there
in the dark
great good girl
and the best constructed
building in town is
the jail of course
bingo
she senses him in there
you think shes telling the truth
suppose hes taking control of her
then i guess ill pay with my life
youre not the only one amigo
youre not the only one

somebodys gotta be inside
escape hatch huh
when they get in
one of us goes through the hole
the other guy presses
the control button
the doors shut they get trapped
but it has to be me

rule number 10 jack
you cant kill a master at night
its over
hes right padre
lets go
hello jack
motherfucker
your wars over crusader
hello jack
from your expression
i assume you cant
understand my presence here
im sorry to disillusion you
as one grows old
as death approaches
we begin to question
our faith
and i found mine lacking
is there a god is there a heaven
i can no longer answer this
for certain
ive witnessed no miracles
had no visions
and the prospect of death
terrifies me
i realized ive only one alternative
and i made a bargain
with the devil if you wish
you are truly
a pile of dogshit cardinal
yeah thats right
thats correct jack
and i can live with that
after ive given valek
what he wants
hell fulfill our bargain
and i will be transformed into
one of his
new children
its beautiful isnt it
eternal life
immortality
can change your heart
prove you can kick my ass
come on untie me
fucking polesmoking fashion victim
come on over here
five minutes then you can bite my ass
would you like that
what will silence you
come on untie me you prick
perhaps this will help
apparently your friend is
one of my children now
you are alone crusader
what do you want from me
you hate me so dont you
but you made me crusader
you hate what youve made
you fear it
because it is superior to you
for 600 years
i fed on your kind at will
why dont you just kill me
because youre needed
the ceremony is a reenactment
of the original exorcism
it requires the blood
of a crusader
and his crucifixion
upon a burning cross
the climax of the ceremony
must coincide
with the first rays
of the rising sun
sorry jack
padre
now whatre you gonna do valek
you got nobody to
complete your ritual
the suns starting to rise
you will finish the ritual
try and make me
thataboy padre fuck with him
