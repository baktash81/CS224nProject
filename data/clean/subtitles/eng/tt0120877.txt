forget it 
buon giorno 
come  please sit down 
who s this 
this is   
   father adam guiteau 
father adam s in charge
of our archives 
a bookworm 
he s familiar with all
your activities 
so speak freely 
tell me what happened 
we cleaned out the nest 
a master showed up 
no master was ever like this 
superhuman strength  unkillable 
we didn t stand a chance 
so tell me  cardinal   
   but couldn t he be the one 
the one we knew would
come along one day 
there are some other developments 
sad developments 
tom 
our tom  our tom callahan 
he s dead 
and the whole european team
is wiped out 
when 
three days ago 
callahan was clearing
a nest near cologne  germany 
local authorities reported it
as a terrorist act 
we found this at the site 
is he the one 
yes 
what is this 
a celebratum 
it s medieval latin for  celebrate  
 celebrate this  
celebrate what 
we don t know 
i ve authenticated it 
it was painted in 1340 
the subject s name is  was  valek 
jan valek  born in prague  1311 
he was a priest   
   who turned against the church
and led peasants   
   in an uprising 
capturing several towns 
valek was captured 
he was tried for heresy
and burned at the stake 
but after his death
he was seen walking at night 
he killed the living
to drink their blood 
they opened his grave 
and it was found empty 
it s the first known case
of vampirism 
a priest 
valek is not like the other masters
you ve hunted  he is the first   
   and most powerful 
of our slayers  you are
the only one who faced valek   
   and survived 
i m going back out 
you mind if i hang on to this 
i ve been in contact with rome 
the vatican council   
   requests that you rebuild
your team 
  there isn t time 
  you re to return to monterey   
   recruit new team members   
   and try again when
you are at full strength 
father adam will accompany you
and take the place   
   of poor father giovanni 
i don t think so 
this is nonnegotiable 
valek is the original 
the source of the disease 
the first vampire created
by the church 
  by accident 
  shut the fuck up 
this was your fight  cardinal 
now it is mine 
if you refuse to obey the rules 
the operation will be canceled   
   the funding withdrawn 
you have any idea how
this valek knows my name 
stay close to him 
what s your name 
do you understand
what s happened to you 
help me 
don t fuck with me  honey 
i ll snap your neck like a twig 
now nod your head yes or no 
do you understand
what s happened to you 
do it 
all right 
now i m going to explain it to you 
first  i m gonna take
my hand off your mouth 
you scream   
good 
what s your name 
katrina 
okay  katrina 
here s the score 
i took off your clothes 
i cleaned you up 
i tied you down 
i also saved your ass 
you ve been bitten by a vampire 
remember the party at the motel 
big guy  pointy teeth 
really shitty breath 
don t worry 
it ll come back to you 
a master vampire has a telepathic
link with his victims 
you re gonna help us find him 
while he s sleeping 
we unleash on him 
you re the bait  honey 
sorry 
i know all about you  mr  crow 
i know your parents were
bitten by vampires 
you were raised by the church
as it s master slayer 
the truth is  i didn t want
to be forced on you 
i was supposed to take over when
father giovanni retired 
i always dreamed of this 
ever since i first heard
about you  the slayers 
i want to be part of the team 
just do whatever i could 
for example  if you
wanted to receive   
   the sacrament of confession  
fucking priest 
who set us up 
was it you  who set us up 
who was it 
was it you  who set us up 
i don t know what you mean 
you don t think i ll
kill you  a priest 
you re seriously misjudging me 
you want to kill me 
you go ahead 
i don t know what you re
talking about 
i don t 
we ll see about that 
where are we going 
you have to tell me  mr  crow 
you ever seen a vampire 
first of all 
they re not romantic 
they re not a bunch of fags
in rented formalwear   
   seducing everybody with
euro trash accents 
forget what you ve seen
in the movies 
they don t turn into bats 
crosses don t work 
garlic  stand there with garlic 
one of them will bend you over   
   and walk up your strata chocolata
while sucking your blood 
all right  and they don t sleep
in taffeta lined coffins 
you wanna kill one  drive a
wooden stake through his heart 
sunlight turns them into
crispy critters 
got it 
see this map 
this map shows all the encounters
in the u s  as far back as the 1800s 
  i ve never seen it 
  no one has 
look at the southwest 
see the spiral pattern 
time sequence the encounters  you get
a logarithmic pattern  ever widening 
it s a search pattern  padre 
they re looking for something 
do you know what it is 
i heard stories
when i was young 
something about a black cross 
about vampires walking
in the sunlight 
padre 
can i ask you something 
when i was kicking your ass   
   did that give you wood 
you get a little mahogany
from that ebony 
i m just fucking with you 
forget about it 
and what god has given her   
   is that she sees
her guardian angel 
oh  jesus 
what time is it 
9 10 
you want one 
you gotta eat something 
i can t 
i wouldn t mind a cigarette 
we have to work on this 
the less you eat 
the faster the virus moves 
virus 
that s what i call it 
nobody knows what it really is 
poison  kool aid 
it all does the same thing 
turns you into a vampire 
what happened to the other girls 
they didn t make it 
i m sorry 
so you remember now 
yeah  some 
  why doesn t anyone know 
  nobody wants to know 
that s how vampires survive 
they re smart 
they keep their numbers low 
and the world never catches on 
will i be one 
i don t know for sure 
probably 
unless we find him before you turn 
then  maybe there s a chance 
here s what we do know 
you re connected to the master vampire 
he s a part of you 
and this link will grow 
you ll never get him out of you 
not while he still exists 
then i don t want to live 
you may not 
can i get dressed now

  we found him 
lord 
i don t get this 
why come all this way to attack
some old priest and a cleaning lady 
valek didn t feed on either of them 
father molina was a scholar of
early catholic history 
  what s the point 
  i don t know 
i don t know why valek killed him 
  what s this 
  the church doesn t know 
you and the cardinal
are lying sacks of shit 
come on  help me

the church and its followers  part of 
  open your mouth 
  what 
open your mouth 
give me your hand 
you listen to me  you fuck 
my father kept a secret once 
he d been bitten by a vampire 
he kept it a secret from me
and my mother 
by the fifth day  he was turning 
that night  he attacked my mother 
and then he came after me 
i killed my own father  padre 
i got no trouble killing you 
last chance 
now open your mouth 
open your fucking mouth 
then prepare to 
what  you ready 
excuse me 
valek is looking for an ancient relic 
the cross of berziers 
after his trial  the church
declared valek possessed 
he was taken to a town
in france called berziers 
an exorcism was performed
using an ancient   
   forbidden form of the ceremony 
it was long and very brutal 
something went wrong 
the wooden gate is opening 
the accounts are confused 
but they refer to an inverse exorcism 
the body is destroyed 
but the possessed soul remains 
valek was transformed
into a creature   
   whose body is dead but lives on 
a vampire 
a vampire 
it s a cross 
the stories about
the black cross are true 
it was used in the exorcism
and taken to rome 
it s known as the berziers cross 
it was shipped to the new world 
it was moved from
one spanish mission to another 
its location was kept secret 
even from the vatican 
for hundreds of years it was lost 
cardinal alba found the name   
   of the only living priest
who knew the location 
father joseph molina 
cardinal alba and i came to the u s 
to find father molina 
to reclaim the berziers cross 
and that is all i know 
you re a good man  padre 
welcome to the team 
god forgive me 
he found it 
let s hit it 
wait  wait  stop the car 
that way 
it was here 
you picking up anything 
he s gone 
  you don t look good 
  she hasn t turned yet 
  she can t eat 
  maybe what she wants is human blood 
  she hasn t turned 
  i heard what you said 
why don t you back off 
  what s with you 
  what s with me  what s with you 
you re being an asshole 
what the fuck is your problem 
you re not falling for
this half dead 
fuck 
nice shot 
wanna try again 
  stop it 
  get the fuck out of here 
what re you doing 
we re about to have
one fuck of a fight 
do you know why valek
wants the cross 
think about it for a minute 
i think valek wants to finish
his transformation 
the exorcism wasn t completed 
valek s vulnerable 
able to survive only at night 
so if he completes the ritual 
i think the balance shifts 
for 600 years  valek has wanted to find
a way to live in the daylight 
fuck me 
now with the berziers cross  he will 
a master vampire able to
walk in the sun  unstoppable 
unless we stop him 
we ll have to finish this
some other time 
we got eight hours of sun left 
come on  come on 
come on  baby 
that s where he is 
santiago 
place looks empty 
he s near 
what do you figure
the population is  20 
i d say 30  maybe more 
the question is  how many are goons 
our worst case scenario  half 
15 dead  15 goons 
valek would have been here
several days 
that s right  padre 
he set this up  slowly 
one goon at a time 
he s got the cross and the biggest nest
the world s ever known 
what do we got  three slayers 
two slayers 
it s time to kill some vampires 
you with us  padre 
yeah  i m with you 
their location 
where is he 
everywhere 
katrina  baby  listen 
is he in there 
yes 
he s in there 
in the dark 
great  good girl 
and the best constructed
building in town is 
the jail  of course 
bingo 
she senses him in there 
you think she s telling the truth 
suppose he s taking control of her 
then i guess i ll pay with my life 
you re not the only one  amigo 
you re not the only one 
can you hear me 
i m sorry 
it ll be all right 
i ll take care of you

we have to make them

yank them right out into the sun 
someone has to drive the jeep 
  how will you lure them in 
  somebody s gotta be inside

one of us goes through the hole 
the other guy presses
the control button

i ve witnessed no miracles 
had no visions 
and the prospect of death
terrifies me 
i realized i ve only one alternative 
and i made a bargain
with the devil  if you wish 
you are truly   
   a pile of dogshit  cardinal 
yeah  that s right 
that s correct  jack 
and i can live with that 
after i ve given valek

the ceremony is a reenactment
of the original exorcism 
it requires the blood
of a crusader   
   and his crucifixion
upon a burning cross 
the climax of the ceremony
must coincide   
   with the first rays
of the rising sun
