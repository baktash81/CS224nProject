  when the early
morning hours
  have come and gone
  through the misty
morning showers
  i greet the dawn
  for when its light
has hit the ground
  there s lots of treasures
to be found
  underneath
the lovely london sky
 birds squawking 
 man shouting indistinctly 
 horse whinnies 
  though the lamps
i m turning down
  please don t feel blue
  for in this part
of london town
  the light shines through
  don t believe
the things you ve read
  you never know
what s up ahead
  underneath the lovely
london sky
  have a pot of tea
  mend your broken cup
  there s a different
point of view awaiting you
  if you would just look up
  man  oi  get out of here 
    i know
  yesterday you had to borrow
from your chums
  seems the promise
of tomorrow never comes
  but since you dreamed
the night away
  tomorrow s here 
it s called today
  so count your blessings
you re a lucky guy
  for you re underneath
the lovely london sky
 whistling 
morning  jack 
 continues whistling 
admiral above decks 
  listen
  soon the slump will
disappear  it won t be long
  sooner than you think
you ll hear
  some bright new song
you re all right  children 
  so hold on tight
to those you love
  and maybe soon
from up above
  you ll be blessed 
so keep on looking high
  while you re underneath
the lovely london sky

  i ll take that  father 
oh  thank you 
uh  please come through 
gooding  uh   
michael  now  what is it
that i can do for you 
i am hamilton gooding 
this is mr  templeton frye 
we are solicitors with
the law firm of gordy  cordry 
  gooding and frye 
   jane giggles 
what 
no  sorry  nothing 
 spruce  
is that your garden club 
no  it s the society for
the protection of the rights
of the underpaid citizens
of england 
a labor organizer 
she s a labor organizer 
yes 
yes  but we also run
soup kitchens 
it s a never ending job
these days  i m afraid 
i m sure it is  mrs  banks 
miss banks  actually 
i m michael s sister 
my wife passed away
this last year 
that s awful 
those poor children 
yes  our deepest condolences 
thank you  forgive me 
what brings the two of you
here this morning 
i m going to say my goodbyes 
i m late for work 
mr  banks 
you took out a loan
with the
fidelity fiduciary bank   
last year against the value
of your home 
you did what  michael 
i had to  jane 
with kate and the bills piling
up  i really had no choice 
it s hard enough
these days  isn t it 
yes  well    shh 
it seems you have fallen
three months behind
in your payments 
oh   sighs 
i m so sorry 
uh  kate  my wife  used to
look after our finances 
and i ve been a bit
off stride  forgive me 
how much is it
that i owe you  exactly 
unfortunately 
the bank is now demanding
that you pay back
the entire loan in full 
the entire loan 
yes  it s all in the contract 
that s more than i make in
a year  i couldn t possibly 
oh  dear 
you have five days 
if you are unable
to pay in full
by friday at midnight   
i m afraid we will have
to repossess your home   
and you will have to vacate
the premises 
but i work
for fidelity fiduciary 
not as an accountant 
i presume 
no  as a teller 
i took a part time position
there this past year 
you see 
i m really an artist 
yes  be that as it may 
but my father  george banks 
was a senior partner there 
father left us shares
in the bank 
you could use those
to pay off the loan 
i was saving those
for the children 
shares  in the bank 
well  that does change things 
doesn t it 
primed and ready 
mr  binnacle 
ready and charged  sir 
do you have
the share certificate 
  i m sorry  the what 
  frye  the document   
the document proving
you own shares in the bank 
i suppose it must be somewhere
among father s old papers 
yes  i suppose it must 
admiral boom  three   
two   
one 
fire 
 explodes 
good heavens 
 grunts 
 whimpers 
are you housing anarchists 
jane  no  that s the admiral 
next door 
he fires off a cannon
to mark the hour 
 gooding coughs 
he s over five minutes late 
yes  i m afraid
he s been running
a little behind
these last few years 
as are we  this morning 
you ve been given notice 
we ll see ourselves out 
come along  mr  frye 
i do hope you find that share
certificate  i really do 
good day to you both 
you really have chosen the
wrong profession  you know 
 door closes 
why didn t you tell me
you d taken out a loan 
 sighs  i didn t want
to worry you 
or the children 
i kept thinking
i would catch up 
kate always managed 
 sighs  of all
the thick headed mistakes 
i can t lose our home  jane 
she s everywhere  here 
well  then  we re not
going to let that happen 
but  michael  you know we
neither of us have any money 
so we just have to find
that share certificate 
do you have any idea where
father might have kept it 
i don t know 
  in the attic  perhaps 
  yes 
i m sorry  i didn t mean
to bring you into all of this 
michael 
  michael 
   sighs 
this is our family home 
and you re about to lose it 
so please stop pretending
everything s fine  you need   
are we going to lose our home 
  no  no  no  no 
  no  no  i   
michael  aunt jane was only   
 stammers  i was just saying
you won t have to worry 
because your father
owns shares in the bank 
but you said we don t have
enough money 
well  i can make more money 
i am a banker now  aren t i 
that s what bankers do 
make money 
but you re not a banker 
you re a painter 
yes  well 
painters don t make money 
not these days  here  you see 
the day has hardly begun 
and i have already made you
10 pounds 
   children giggling 
  we d best be going 
yes  yes  let s get
your hats on  shall we 
one moment  john 
georgie shouldn t have to
spend his 10 pounds
on the shopping  should he 
here you are 
thank you  father 
ah  off to the park  i see 
  yes  that s right  ellen 
  that s nice 
shall we search
the attic  then 
don t you have to go to work 
no  work can wait 
oh  thank you  jane 
well  why don t i check
the attic
and you check father s
old wardrobe 
  yes 
  we ll make lunch when we get home  ellen 
  gillie stays here 
  georgie  aw 
 chuckles  blimey  what little
grown ups you ve become 
annabel  father didn t give us
enough  did he 
john  not nearly 
annabel  well  we can ask for
day old bread at half off 
that s what mother
used to do 
hello  willoughby 
hello  miss lark 
  hello  georgie  twins 
  georgie  oh 
good boy  willoughby 
come on  georgie  we haven t
got enough time for this 
  aw 
  come along  come on  wil 
 gasps  the balloon lady 
can we get balloons 
no  georgie  we haven t enough
for groceries as it is 
oi  georgie banks 
keep off the grass 
i don t spend all day
caring for it
just to see my work
get trampled on 
go on  off it 
sorry 
what if father
does lose the house 
we ll just have to
figure out a way
to get it back  i suppose 
you re right 
that s what mother would do 
no 
 music box chiming 
  we haven t spoken
in so long  dear
  this year has gone by
in a blur
  today  seems
everything s gone wrong here
  i m looking
for the way things were
  i know you d laugh
and call me tragic
  for everything s
in disarray
  these rooms
were always full of magic
  that s vanished   
  since you went away
  this house is crowded now
with questions
  your john s
a walking questionnaire
  and i could surely use
a few suggestions
  on how to brush
our daughter s hair
  when georgie
needed explanations
  you always knew
just what to say
  and i miss
our family conversations
  it s silent   
  since you went away
  winter has gone
  but not from this room
  snow s left the lane
  but the cherry trees
forgot to bloom
the certificate 
the certificate 
 clears throat 
  i ll carry on
the way you told me
  i say that
like i have a choice
  and though you are not here
to hold me
  in the echoes 
i can hear your voice
  but still one question
fills my day  dear
  the answer
i ve most longed to know
  each moment
since you went away  dear
  my question  kate  is   
  where d you go 
jane  nothing in the wardrobe 
oh  my goodness 
yes  it s quite a mess 
jane  yes  it is 
what are all your art things
doing up here 
oh  i wasn t
using them anymore 
i should probably just
get rid of it all 
have you looked
in father s old desk 
michael  i honestly
can t remember why we kept
most of this stuff
to begin with 
i mean  why on earth did we
save this old broken thing 
don t you remember that kite 
we used to love flying that
with mother and father 
well  it won t fly anymore 
out it goes 
no looking back 
  hold on tight
to those you love
  and maybe soon
from up above  
   barking 
  willoughby 
  naughty boy 
   continues barking 
hush 
annabel  how long do you think
it will take us today 
well  let s see  it s a
9 minute walk to the shop 
   georgie giggles 
  so if it takes 10 minutes   
to purchase each item   
excuse me  children 
coming through 
georgie  come back 
  john  georgie 
  park keeper  you two 
i ve told you before 
off the grass 
  but our brother 
  you heard me 
now  what 
 annabel panting 
 gasps 
 panting 
 chuckles 
 grunting 
whoa  oh 
georgie   screaming  help 
we re coming  georgie 
georgie  help 
georgie  help 
  hold on 
  help me 
   screams 
   jack grunts 
as i live and breathe 
you need to be more careful
when the wind rises  georgie 
you nearly lost your kite 
and you two
nearly lost your georgie 
he might have
got away completely
had i not been holding on
to the other end
of that string 
my goodness  annabel   
what have you done
to your clothes 
you could grow a garden
in that much soil 
and  john   
yes  just as filthy 
how do you know our names 
because she s mary poppins 
of course 
may i say  you look lovely 
as always 
do you really think so 
nice to see you  jack 
good to see you too 
mary poppins 
i was just your age
when we first met 
working for a chimney sweep 
how is dear old bert 
traveling the world  he is 
off to points unknown 
well  now i am off to speak
with the father
of these children 
this family is clearly
in desperate need of a nanny 
now  quick march
and best foot forward 
and i ll thank you
not to dawdle 
go on 
 annabel sighs 
father  aunt jane  come quick 
  quickly 
  what is it  georgie 
has something happened 
i was flying a kite
and it got caught on a nanny 
whatever are you
talking about 
come  come  look 
wait  where did you get
that kite 
i found it in the park 
she kept it from blowing away 
  mary   
  poppins 
oh  close your mouth
please  michael 
we are still not a codfish 
 giggles 
jane banks  still rather
inclined to giggle  i see 
good heavens 
it really is you 
you seem hardly
to have aged at all 
really 
how incredibly rude 
one never discusses
a woman s age  michael 
i would have hoped
i taught you better 
  i m sorry  i didn t mean   
  you came back 
i thought
we d never see you again 
it is wonderful to see you 
yes  it is  isn t it 
annabel 
so  you know her  then 
mary poppins
used to be our nanny 
what brings you here
after all this time 
mary  same thing that
brought me the first time 
i ve come to look after
the banks children 
  us 
  oh  yes  you too 
annabel 
but we don t need a nanny 
mother taught us
to look after ourselves 
you did just misplace georgie 
i might point out 
only slightly 
we got him back 
we can do anything
a nanny can 
georgie  mary poppins
flew here on a kite 
you can t do that  can you 
what are you talking about 
georgie  don t be silly 
jane  oh  let him believe
what he likes 
when your father and i were
young  we used to imagine   
that mary poppins could do all
sorts of impossible things 
parrot umbrella  actually   
 actually   what 
actually  i d like to get back
to the matter
of my employment 
your umbrella talks 
georgie  please 
we re in the midst
of a grown up conversation 
annabel  why don t we go
upstairs  georgie 
but it did talk  i promise 
i m afraid georgie sometimes
suffers from an excess
of imagination 
as i recall 
you had the same affliction
yourself when you were young 
did i  really  well 
those days are long behind me 
are they  indeed  hmm 
  now  about my employment   
  yes  about your employment   
the truth is 
i simply can t afford   
we can settle on terms later 
although i will want
my old room back 
that s if it s not
a complete disaster   
and i will insist on having
every second tuesday off 
  no  i m afraid  i   
  of course  mary poppins 
good  good 
that s all settled 
then i ll stay 
now  if you ll excuse me   
the children have turned
themselves into dustbins 
so the first order of business
is to see them properly
bathed and dressed 
jane  have you gone
completely mad 
i can t afford to take
on anyone else 
mary poppins
isn t just anyone 
don t you see  michael 
no one s
hiring nannies anymore 
the poor woman
has nowhere to go 
  well  neither will we by the end of the week 
  oh  don t be so grumpy 
  you sound just like father 
  i do not 
give mary poppins a chance 
you need help
just as much as she does 
very well  she can stay
for the time being  i suppose 
after all  she did fly
all this way on a kite 
 both laugh 
those things  when we were
young  they didn t really   
  happen 
  no 
  no 
  of course not 
ridiculous 
 both chuckle 
oh  hello  mary poppins 
hello  ellen 
how d you do that 
do what 
and why didn t father believe
you flew here on a kite 
because it s complete
nonsense  of course 
grown ups forget 
they always do 
mary  that will be
quite enough of that 
i should have left you
in the umbrella stand 
   gasps  not with the canes 
  oh 
   georgie giggles 
   speaking indistinctly 
what are you two
whispering about 
both  nothing 
 nothing   such a
useful word  isn t it 
it can mean anything
and everything 
annabel  it s just that   
you don t require
the services of a nanny 
well  we have grown up
a good deal
in the past year 
after all 
yes 
well  we ll have to see
what can be done about that 
annabel  that was
our mother s  be careful 
i am always careful 
so  you re staying 
yes  i ll stay 
until the door opens 
what does that mean 
that door s always opening 
oh  not that door 
another one 
the bathroom door 
 chuckles 
that s just silly  georgie 
  not the bathroom door 
  mary  no 
but a bath would prove useful 
come along 
time for a good  clean start 
mother always had us
take our baths in the evening 
well  in my experience 
annabel   
the perfect time of day
to have a bath
is when one needs a wash 
georgie  you will go first 
we are perfectly capable
of drawing our own baths 
mary  how very helpful  john 
in that case 
you may turn off the tap 
but not quite yet  still need
to put in the bubbles 
but i don t like
soap bubbles 
well  then
you shall have to try
to avoid them at all costs 
she s a tough nut 
isn t she 
 sighs  all right then   
but we ll have to
get this done quickly 
right  we still have to
get down to the grocers   
and it looks as though
it might rain 
  i know who you should ask 
   john sighs 
her umbrella can t talk 
georgie 
the very idea 
how do you know it can t 
annabel  because it can t 
the very notion is ridiculous 
exactly right  annabel 
it s nonsense 
foolishness 
it makes no sense 
and if it makes no sense 
it can t be true 
  john  you re right
  it s good to know
you re bright
  for intellect
can wash away confusion
  georgie sees 
and annabel agrees
  most folderol s
an optical illusion
  you three know it s true
that one plus one is two
  yes  logic is the rock
of our foundation
  i suspect 
and i m never incorrect
  that you re far too old
to give in to imagination
 dolphin clicking 
no  not yet 
 georgie gasps 
  some people like
to splash and play
  can you imagine that 
  and take a seaside holiday
  can you imagine that 
  too much glee leaves
rings around the brain
  take that joy
and send it down the drain
  some people
like to laugh at life
  and giggle through the day
  they think the world s
a brand new  shiny toy
  and if while dreaming
in the clouds
  they fall and go kersplat
  although they re down
and bent in half
  they brush right off
and start to laugh 
  can you imagine that 
on second thoughts 
perhaps you re right 
it makes no sense to take
a bath this early 
wait  i want to take a bath 
oh  really 
  very well  then 
   georgie chuckles 
  up you go 
   gasps 
  and in you go 
   echoing  whoa 
 gasps  georgie 
 echoing  georgie 
john 
what happened 
will they be all right 
well  it is just a bath 
after all 
but then again 
it s not my tub 
annabel  shouldn t you go in
after them 
oh  no  i had my bath
this morning  thank you 
well  if you won t  i will 
 echoing  whoa 
off we go 
 giggling 
 john panting 
 water bubbling 
  some people like
to dive right in
  can you imagine that 
  and flap about
in bathtub gin
  can you imagine that 
  doggies paddling
20 leagues below
 barks 
  might seem real 
but we know it s not so
  to cook without a recipe
  can you imagine that 
  and heaven knows what lives
within that pot 
  some pirates follow
treasure maps
  and wear a silly hat
  they search the world
for buried gold
  they won t grow up
and don t grow old 
  can you imagine that 
be sure to scrub
behind your ears 
 dolphins clicking 
 breathing heavily 
 giggles 
 children exclaiming 
  some answer
when adventure calls 
all 
  can you imagine that 
  and sail straight
over waterfalls 
all 
  can you imagine that 
  they see living
as its own reward
ahoy 
  they rock the boat 
then   
  whoa 
  man overboard 
  some people
look out on the sea
  and see a brand new day
  their spirit lifts them high
above the blue
  yet  some others
wear an anchor
  and they sink
in seconds flat
  so   
  perhaps we ve learnt
when day is done
  some stuff and nonsense
could be fun 
all 
  can you imagine that 
 children exclaiming 
 georgie laughing 
michael  no 
no 
no 
no  anything 
no  nothing 
just your old drawings 
and bills  and nothing else 
well  then that s it 
it s not here 
john  father  aunt jane 
annabel  it was amazing 
and then there were these boats 
georgie  everything you could
ever dream of 
annabel  and then 
he fell in the water 
not now  please 
but it really happened 
tell him  mary poppins 
i have no idea
what you re all talking about 
we swam through
a pirate ship 
enough  please 
you re right  father 
we re sorry 
no  i m sorry  i m sorry 
i don t mean to be cross
with all of you  i   
i ve just lost something
very important 
yes  and we re
going to find it 
i m sure your grandfather just
tucked it away somewhere
for safekeeping 
the bank 
didn t father have a safety
deposit box in the bank 
yes  yes  he did 
  well  let s go 
  it s closed 
we ll go first thing
in the morning 
but won t we need a key

full of keys
in father s old desk upstairs 
  michael  is there 
  jane  yes 
my goodness  gracious 
glory me

to pick up after themselves 
cleaning is not a spectator
sport  i ll remind you 
john  annabel

back on the bookshelves 
georgie banks

what  sell my
prized possessions

what s got into him 
 panting  annabel 
  i know how to save the house 
  what do you mean 
if you two are going to keep
up all of this whispering   
i d like you
to practice doing so
as loudly as possible 
it will still be bad manners 
but at least then we ll all
be in on the secret 
oh  hello  jack 
mary poppins 
how are you this fine evening 
mary  i m settling in
quite nicely  thank you 
 softly  i was downstairs

it s been ages
since i ve seen her 
well  she lives in a flat
on the other side of town now 
i m sure you ll bump into her
one of these days 
what are you doing 
you know we re not supposed
to touch that 
this is authentic
royal doulton china  annabel 
mother always said
it was priceless   
and i bet it ll be enough
to pay off father s debt 
that s a terrible idea  john 
you know
mother loved that bowl 
but she d sell it herself
to save the house 
that was mother s 
put that back 
annabel  no  georgie 
give it to me 
  georgie  no  put it back

mary  mmm

as a chocolate teapot 
the bowl is speaking 
shamus  and who do we think

aye  there s the riddle 
them what broke it fixes it 
that s what i say 
what do you think 
mary poppins 
well  i suppose
we have no choice 
but how are we
going to do that 
i know a bit
about fixing carriages 
but we can t fix
the carriage wheel 
it isn t possible

we re on the brink
of an adventure  children 
don t spoil it
with too many questions 
let s go  clyde 
easy 
  in the nursery 
you were never by yourself
  there was quite another
world upon your shelf
hold on 
  where each day
crowds make their way
  upon the sun s descent
  to a mythical  mystical 
never quite logistical tent
  yes  in this
dearly dynamical
  simply ceramical
royal doulton bowl
  there s a cuddly
and curious
  furry and furious
animal watering hole
  where the monkeys
and humming birds
  know the tunes
and the words
  every beast
large and small
  loves the very
top drawer able
  always encore able
royal doulton music hall
ooh  that one
tickled my tail 
nearly there 
mary poppins 
both    yes 
in this marvelous  mystical
  rather sophistical
royal doulton bowl
  there s a lot of birds
queuing up
  a lot of hams chewing up
scenery they swallow whole
  there are lots of cats
tuning strings
mary    nightingales
in the wings
both    waiting for
their big drum roll
    at the simply sensational
    standing ovation al
    royal doulton music hall
    music hall
  shamus  here we are 
   clyde chuffs 
but where s the music hall 
oh  yes  that  silly me 
  wolf  step right up 
   children exclaim 
step right up
for the simply sensational
  royal doulton music hall 
   indistinct chatter 
how on earth
did she do that 
one thing you should know
about mary poppins   
she never explains anything 
come on 
wolf  hurry  hurry 
only a few seats left 
get tickets while you can
for the one night only

  nearly untamable
 crowd cheering

  royal doulton
  music hall

  jack  come on

 jack chuckles 
  thank you 
  sing for us  mary poppins 
  no  no  no  no 
  come on  have a go 
no  i haven t sung in years 
penguins 
sing for us  mary poppins 
  please  please 
  do sing for us 
no  i couldn t possibly 
d flat major 
 orchestral music playing 
  uncle gutenberg
was a bookworm
  and he lived
on charing cross
  the memory of his volumes
brings a smile
  he would read me
lots of stories
  when he wasn t
on the sauce
  now i d like to share
the wisdom
  of my favorite bibliophile
  he said
 in cockney accent 
  a cover is not the book
  so open it up
and take a look
   cause under the covers
  one discovers
that the king may be a crook
  chapter titles
are like signs
  and if you read
between the lines
  you ll find your
first impression was mistook
  for a cover is nice
but a cover is not the book
 animals scatting 
mary poppins 
could you give us an example 
  certainly 
   gasps and sighs 
  nellie rubina
was made of wood
  but what could not be seen
  was though her trunk up top
was barren
  well  her roots
were lush and green
  so in spring
when mr  hick ry
  saw her blossoms
bloomin  there
  he took root 
despite her bark
  and now there s
seedlings everywhere 
both    which proves a
cover is not the book
  so open it up
and take a look
   cause under the covers
  one discovers
that the king may be a crook
  chapter titles
are like signs
  and if you read
between the lines
  you ll find your
first impression was mistook
  for a cover is nice
but a cover is not the book 
shall we do the one
about the  wealthy widow  
oh  by all means 
always loved that one 
well  go on then 
  lady hyacinth macaw brought
all her treasures to a reef
  where she only
wore a smile
  plus two feathers
and a leaf
mary 
  so no one tried to rob her
   cause she barely
wore a stitch
  for when you re
in your birthday suit
  there ain t much there
to show you re rich 
  oh  a cover
is not the book
  so open it up
and take a look
   cause under the covers
  one discovers
that the king may be a crook
 scatting 
  you ll find your
first impression was mistook
 scatting 
  for a cover is nice 
but a cover is not the book  
oh  give us the one about the
 dirty rascal   why don t ya 
isn t that one a bit long 
well  the quicker
you re into it 
the quicker you re out of it 
  once upon a time
in a nursery rhyme
  there was a castle
with a king hiding in a wing
   cause he never
went to school
  to learn a single thing
  he had scepters and swords
and a parliament of lords
  but on the inside he was sad
egad 
  because he never had
a wisdom for numbers
  a wisdom for words
  though his crown
was quite immense
  his brain was smaller
than a bird s
  so the queen of the nation
made a royal proclamation
   to the missus
and the messers
   the more or lessers
   bring me
all the land s professors 
  then she went
to the hair dressers
  and they came from the east
and they came from the south
  from each college 
they poured knowledge
  from their brains
into his mouth
  but the king
couldn t learn
  so each professor
met their fate
  for the queen
had their heads removed
  and placed upon the gate
  and on that date
  i state their wives
all got a note
  their mate
was now the late great
  but then suddenly one day
a stranger started in to sing
  he said 
 i m the dirty rascal
   and i m here
to teach the king  
  and the queen clutched her
jewels for she hated royal fools
  but this fool
had some rules
  they really ought
to teach in schools
  like you ll be a happy king if
you enjoy the things you ve got
  you should never try to be
  the kind of person
that you re not
  so they sang
and they laughed
  for the king
had found a friend
  and they ran onto a rainbow
for the story s perfect end
  so the moral is you mustn t
let the outside be the guide
  for it s not so cut
and dried
  well  unless it s doctor
jekyll then you better hide
  petrified 
no  the truth can t be denied
  as i have now
have testified
  all that really counts
and matters
  is the special
stuff inside 
  hooray 
  he did it 
 all cheering 
all    oh 
a cover is not the book
  so open it up
and take a look
   cause under the covers
  one discovers
that the king may be a crook
  so please
listen to what we ve said
  and open a book
tonight in bed
  so one more time
before we get the hook
  sing it out strong 
    a cover is nice
    please take our advice
    a cover is nice
    or you ll pay the price 
  a cover is nice
but a cover is not the book  
 animals scatting 
   all cheering

   grunts

 children scream 
 laughs 
oh  no 
all  the edge of the bowl 
 children screaming 
mary 
georgie  it s all right 
it s all right 
my goodness me 
 breathing heavily 
shh  it s all right 
you were having a nice
sort of nightmare  i must say 
you were right  mary poppins 
a cover is not the book 
we thought they were nice 
but they were mean 
whatever are you
talking about 
they tried to take gillie 
no  gillie is right here 
sleeping  as you should be 
but it was real 
they stole all our things   
and the wolf said
we were never
going to see our home again 
that is absurd 
but i had a nightmare
like that  too 
so did i 
it seemed awfully real 
i don t want to lose our home 
you see  georgie 
that s why we wanted
mother s bowl 
we were going to sell it
to save the house 
i miss mother 
oh  listen
to the three of you 
you re all worrying
far too much 
after all  you can t lose
what you ve never lost 
i don t understand 
well   
  do you ever
lie awake at night 
  just between the dark
and the morning light
  searching for the things
you used to know
  looking for the place
where the lost things go 
  do you ever dream
or reminisce 
  wondering where to find
what you truly miss 
  well  maybe all those things
that you love so
  are waiting in the place
where the lost things go
  memories you ve shared 
gone for good you feared
  they re all
around you still
  though they ve disappeared
  nothing s really left
or lost without a trace
  nothing s gone forever 
only out of place
  so maybe now the dish
and my best spoon
  are playing hide and seek
just behind the moon
  waiting there
until it s time to show
  spring is like that now
  far beneath the snow
  hiding in the place
where the lost things
  go
now  time to get some sleep 
and in the morning 
bright and early   
we ll take that bowl
to my cousin 
we ll have it mended 
  time to close your eyes
  so sleep can come around
  for when you dream
  you ll find all that s lost
is found
  maybe on the moon
  or maybe somewhere new
  maybe all you re missing
lives inside of you
  so  when you need her touch
and loving gaze
   gone but not forgotten 
is the perfect phrase
  smiling from a star
that she makes glow
  trust she s always there
  watching as you grow
  find her in the place
where the lost things
  go
john  look 
mary poppins  scarf 
it wasn t a dream after all 
shall we tell her 
better not 
i expect she already knows

you tell mary poppins 
who doesn t listen   
that any other day 
tatiana antanasia cositori
topotrepolovsky   
can fix anything 
  if you ring
with something broken
  on a thursday
  i ll make new with my glue 
pins and thread
  what you bring 
when i ve awoken
  on a friday
  i will mend  and then spend
the day in bed
  children  satur  sun 
and mondays
  are just
everything is fun days
  but in the second week 
i wear a frown
  for i know
that after tuesday
  comes the
topsy gets bad news day
  it s the dreaded
second wednesday
  when from nine to noon
my life turns upside down
 children laughing 
 georgie screams 
  fast is slow  low is high
stop is go and that is why
  every second wednesday
is a hurdle
  from eight to nine
all is well
  then i roll over
on my shell
  and all because
the world is turning turtle
  now day is night  dog is cat
black is white  thin is fat
  that is why
i m loosening up my girdle
  i cannot help
this charming troupe
  don t mock me
 cause i m in the soup
  and why  because the world
is turning turtle
  oh  woe is me
i m as opposite as i can be
  i long for thursdays
when the world is drab
  when will it cease 
  now my life resembles
war and peace
  that tolstoy certainly
had the gift of gab
  i couldn t get through it
  bottom s top  yin is yang
  peace and quiet s
sturm und drang
  tuesday nights 
my blood begins to curdle
  east is west  in is out
  and that is why
i need to shout
   oh  no  the world
is turning turtle  
  oh  if you had come
some other morn
  you wouldn t have found me
so forlorn
  but since the day
that i was born
  second wednesdays
is on the fritz
  i couldn t mend this
to save my soul
  if this keeps up 
i ll dig a hole
  you say life s a cherry bowl
but wednesday s full of pits
  tell us 
can you fix this drum 
  well 
today is looking glum
    can you mend this crack 
    and broken string 
  well  perhaps
if you all lend a hand
children and jack    our
fingers are at your command
  a broken songbird
still can sing
  let s do the turtle swing
 georgie giggles 
 children laughing 
 squeals 
  oh  woe is me
now i m on my head
  how can that be 
  well  you say  woe 
but i say  lucky you 
    lucky me 
    yes
  here  on your head
   a  is far behind
and led by  z 
  it s good to get
a different point of view  
i love your shoes 
you see  when the world turns
upside down   
the best thing is
to turn right along with it 
i do see 
from down here 
things look right side up 
 all laugh 
i wouldn t mind seeing things
from that angle 
  sounds like fun 
  can we 
very well  flippity flop 
 children exclaiming 
    near is
    far is
    here is
    there
  turtles turning everywhere
  things are getting clear
  well  knock on wood 
my dear
 grunts 
  when you change the view
from where you stood
  the things you view
will change for good
  i never thought of things
that way
  she never thought of things
that way
  now wednesdays
are my favorite day
all    now wednesdays
are her favorite day
   cause that s the day
i m quite contrary
  and now 
thanks to cousin mary
  i have changed  to be exact
i love the fact
  the world is
turning turtle
  turtle
  turtle
 all laughing 
come  give your bowl
to me   chuckles 
no more am i afraid
with this new point of view 
good 
excuse me 
but do you have any idea
how much our bowl
might be worth 
in money 
not very much  i m afraid 
but that doesn t make it
any less beautiful 
our mother always said
it was priceless 
well  i m sure it was to her 
mary poppins is right 
for once 
it is all in the way
that you look at things 
thank you  cousin 
now  come along  children 
get your hats 
and don t you worry
about mother s bowl 
i will fix
and make perfect for you 
so you come back  maybe

topsy turvy 
 chuckles   topsy turvy  
 chuckles 
i like  it s catchy 
now  what do we do 
i have no idea 
well  like topsy said   
maybe we should start
looking at things differently 
 rumbling and creaking 
oh  marvelous 
it looks like
things are starting
to turn around for my cousin 
john  mary poppins

the quickest way to the bank

nearly that amount
scheduled for next week alone 
who d have thought this slump
would be so good
for business  eh 
i wonder  mr  wilkins 
if  perhaps   
as michael banks
is an employee 
you might consider
giving him a few more weeks 
and lose our chance
to get that house 
i mean     stammers 
i don t like to lose 
mr  frye 
 buzzer buzzing 
wilkins  didn t i ask

help yourselves 
come on 
 office of the bank chairman

wilkins  i m running
a business  not a charity 
frye  it s just that  well   
his family has suffered
tremendous hardship
this past year   
wilkins  you are not giving
banks one more second   
to pay off that loan 
do i make myself clear

he s the wolf
trying to steal our house 
what on earth
are you talking about 
wilkins  i m afraid
your children
burst into my office
just now  banks 
what 
i was just seeing if anything could
be done about extending your loan   
when they came in claiming
i was trying
to steal your house 
he is  we heard him 
mr  wilkins
is trying to help us 
but then 
why was he chasing us 
i just thought they might
stop running around
and making a scene
if i offered them some sweets 
i m so sorry  mr  wilkins 
see it doesn t happen again 
after all  you don t
want your father   
losing his position
on account of you  do you 
hmm 
i know time is
running short  banks   
but i want you to have
every chance
of paying off that loan 
so  i will make sure
that i m in my office
on friday evening   
until the last stroke
of midnight 
you have my word 
oh  thank you  sir 
thank you 
wilkins  gentlemen 
but  father 
he really did do it 
not another word 
  take them home this instant 
  mary  yes  sir 
we ll discuss this
when i get back 
come along  children 
john  now we ve done it 
haven t we 
i don t think
i ve ever seen father
that upset with us before 
georgie  but we were
telling the truth 
annabel  that doesn t
matter  georgie 
we got him into trouble 
and he doesn t even know
that we broke mother s bowl 
everything we ve tried to fix 
we ve only made it worse 
which way do we go 
mary poppins 
mary  now 
why would you ask me 
the three of you are leading
the way  after all 
  annabel  us 
  john  but we were   
walking around in a fog 
no  we weren t  i mean 
we are in a fog  but   
we were only talking 
yes  too focused
on where you ve been
to pay attention
to where you re going 
but father told us
to go straight home 
he ll be furious
if we re late 
not much to be done
about that now  is there 
are we lost  then 
jack  that would depend
on where you want to go 
children  jack 
at your service 
say  what s with
all the glum faces 
lost sixpence
and found a penny 
we ve made a mess
of everything 
father s furious with us 
and we can t find
our way home 
lost 
are you  mary poppins 
hopelessly 
well  now  i m no expert   
but if ever i lose my way 
i just look for a little light
to guide me 
  let s say you re lost
  in a park  sure
  you can give in
to the dark  or
  you can trip a little light
fantastic with me
  when you re alone
in your room
  your choice is just
embrace the gloom
  or you can trip a little
light fantastic with me
  for if you hide
under the covers
  you might
never see the day
  but if a spark can start
inside your heart
  then you can always
find the way
  so when life
is gettin  dreary
  just pretend
that you re a leerie
  as you trip a little
light fantastic with me
what s a leerie 
why  it s what we lamplighters
call ourselves  of course 
time to send up
the call to arms 
leeries  trip the light
to lead the way 
  now  when you re stuck
in the mist  sure
  you can struggle
and resist  or
  you can trip a little
light fantastic with me
  now  say you re lost
in the crowd  well
  you can stamp
and scream out loud  or
  you can trip a little
light fantastic with me
  and when the fog
comes rollin  in
  just keep your feet
upon the path
  mustn t mope and frown
or worse  lie down
  don t let it be
your epitaph
  so  when life
is gettin  scary
  be your own illuminary
  who can shine their light
for all the world to see
  as you trip a little
light fantastic with me
  annabel  hello 
  john  hello 
annabel  thank you 
  a leerie
loves the edge of night
  though dim  to him 
the world looks bright
  he s got the gift
of second sight
leeries    to trip a
little light fantastic 
jack    a leerie s
job s to light the way
leeries    to take the
night and make it day 
  we mimic the moon
yes  that s our aim
leeries    for we re the
keepers of the flame 
  and if you re deep
inside a tunnel
  and there is
no end in sight
  well  just carry on
until the dawn
  it s darkest
right before the light  
john  now what do we do 
well  just as jack said   
we follow the light 
 tapping 
 children gasp 
whoa   laughs 
 annabel yells 
  as you trip
a little light fantastic
  won t you trip
a little light fantastic 
  come on
  trip a little
light fantastic with me  
 slow instrumental
music playing 
 upbeat instrumental

that rhymes  only   
here  i ll show you
how it works 
angus  give us
your weep and wail 
to the rest of ya 
that means  tale  
  i was short of a sheet
  he was in the street
  just to tumble
down the sink
  just to get himself
a drink
  then i pinched
what s fatter
    he grabbed his ladder
    to smile and smirk
  both    to work 
  there s nothing to it 
can you speak leerie 
mary poppins 
can i speak leerie 
of course she can 
she s mary poppins 
  can we do it with you 
  both  please 
oh  very well then 
jack    children 
tell us your sorry tale
leeries    give us
your weep and wail 
    well  we had this bowl
    rabbit in the hole
    that fell and broke
    bicycle spoke
    so we took it to a shop
    like a lollipop
  and went upside down 
mary 
  that s a circus clown
    then went to the bank
    rattle and clank
    got lost in the fog
    lump on a log
john 
  till we found our friend
  to stand and defend
    who took us on a trip
    snap a horse s whip
  and we tripped
a little light fantastic 
  now  that sounds
a little bit bombastic
  but they tripped the light
  we tripped the light
  let s trip
a little light fantastic 
 music continues 
leeries 
  join us  mary poppins 
 leeries exclaim 
you ve got it 
now let s get you
all back home 
all    now 
if your life is gettin  foggy
  that s no reason
to complain
  there s so much in store
inside the door
  of 17 cherry tree lane 
  so when troubles
are incessant
  simply be
more incandescent
  for your light comes with
a lifetime guarantee
  as you
  trip a little
light fantastic
  won t you
    trip a little light fantastic
    come on 
  trip a little
light fantastic
  with me 
  went to the bank 
rattle and clank
  met with the boss
pitch and toss
  got lost in the fog
lump on a log
  trip a little
light fantastic 
children    trip a
little light fantastic 
  trip a little
light fantastic 
  trip a little
light fantastic   
where on earth
have you all been 
i told you to bring them
straight home 
i ve been worried sick 
we re sorry
we re late  father 
it wasn t
mary poppins  fault 
we got lost in the fog 
jack and the leeries led us
down the frog and toad 
he means road 
so you ve been off filling
the children s heads
with stuff and nonsense 
i ve heard quite enough 
come in at once 
best to take my leave 
good night  mary poppins 
good night  jack 
into the parlor  go on 
go on 
don t be too hard
on  em  sir 
they re only children 
after all 
i know they re children 
my children 
and i will deal with them
as i see fit 
  now leave us to it 
  yes  sir 
not you  mary poppins 
in here 
very well  sir 
you could have
lost me my job 
do you understand that 
have you any idea
how difficult it is to find
a good position like mine
these days 
but there you all were 
tearing about like a   
and you  mary poppins 
i thought you were here
to look after these children 
it wasn t her doing 
it was me 
no  it was us 
we thought maybe
if we talked to mr  frye   
he could give you more time
to save the house 
we were only
trying to help 
well  you didn t help 
now   
i know it s been a hard year
for our family   
and i ve done all i can   
to keep you all from worrying 
but i can t do this on my own 
it s too hard  i just   
i m barely holding it
together as it is 
i can t even seem to remember
my briefcase in the morning   
and there s no more time 
we re about to lose
our home   
and i can t lose this house 
i just can t 
i don t know what to do 
 voice breaks  i m sorry 
i don t know what to do 
everything s fallen to pieces
since your mother     crying 
haven t we lost
enough already 
we haven t lost mother 
not really 
  nothing s gone
forever  only out of place
  so when we need her touch
and loving gaze
   gone but not forgotten 
is the perfect phrase
  smiling from a star
that she makes glow
  trust she s always there
  watching as we grow
  find her in the place
  where the lost things go
when did you all
get so clever 
last night 
mary poppins told us   
i hope i m as clever as you
when i grow up 
 chuckles  you re right 
of course  you re right 
georgie 
your mother s not gone 
she s in your smile 
 chuckling 
and in your walk  john   
and annabel s eyes 
and she ll always be with us
wherever we go 
love you 
now  run along  wash your
hands  get ready for dinner 
did you have something
to do with them
trying to save the house 
i never said a word 
it was
all the children s idea 
the whole time
i ve been looking after them 
they ve been looking after me 
i had it all backward 
a banks family trait 
what was i thinking 
some people think
a great deal too much 
of that i m certain 
 sighs 
 leaves rustling

mr  dawes  jr  
i also hear   
you ve been telling

the only loony thing

i ve nearly doubled
the profits of this bank

  and your chance
to dance is done
  that s the time to stand
to strike up the band
  and tell  em that

  so when life s
a real pea souper
  you must choose
to be a trouper
  for your light comes
with a lifetime guarantee
  as you
 upbeat music playing 
  with me 
  went to the bank 
rattle and clank
  met with the boss
pitch and toss

lump on a log

by the way 
those shares of yours   
perfectly fine   
save  em for your family 
i m sorry 
i don t understand 
i d like to tell you
a little story 
once upon a time   
there was a man
with a wooden leg   
 mumbling 
  that s not it 
   all chuckle 
it s about a little boy
named michael 
michael wanted to give his
tuppence to a bird lady   
but after
a little persuasion  hmm 
he decided he d give  em
to his father 
michael s father 
your grandfather   
gave those tuppence
to this bank   
and told us to guard it well 
we did just that 
and after several quite
clever investments   
if i do say so myself   
that tuppence has grown
into quite a tidy sum 
really 
really  michael 
in fact  enough
to pay off that loan you took 
  the house is yours 
   children gasp 
oh 
 all laughing 
michael  what a beautiful day
to be going back home 
look at them
lovely cherry blossoms 
they re lovely 
  i shall have to paint them 
   jane chuckles 
what about you  jane 
what about me 
he means what about you
and that handsome
lamplighter  jack 
   all chuckling 
  no  no  we re just friends 
  oh  go on 
  really 
stop it  ellen 
   all laugh 
  what s this 
the spring fair

children  hooray 
annabel  come on 
father  let s go 
john  will you go
on the ferris wheel with us 
michael  yes 
and you too  jane 
jane  only if you come

ellen  what  wouldn t be

 ellen exclaims 
 children chattering 
 inaudible conversation 
 both laughing 
man 1  follow me  follow me

my turn  my turn 
  let s see it 
  i ve got it 
 all laugh 
man 2  come ride

  michael  georgie   laughs 
  annabel  georgie 
  slow down 
  georgie  race you 
vendor  lollipops 
annabel  look at
the ferris wheel 
the ponies 
  life s a balloon
that tumbles or rises
  depending on what is inside
  fill it with hope
and playful surprises
  and  oh  dearie ducks 
then you re in for a ride
  look inside the balloon
  and if you hear a tune
  there s nowhere to go but up
 gasps 
may we have balloons 
yes  of course 
we can  let s go 
  choose the secret we know
  before life makes us grow
  there s nowhere to go
but up  chuckles 
hello  we would like
some of your very
finest balloons  please 
that you shall have 
but choose carefully 
my dearie ducks 
many have chosen
the wrong balloon 
be sure to choose the one
that s right for you 
which balloon
would you like  georgie 
  um   
  why don t you go first  sir 
michael 
me   chuckles 
those days
are long behind me 
i don t think i ve held
a balloon since i was a child 
then you ve forgotten
what it s like 
to hold a balloon 
to be a child 
  if your selection
feels right
  well  then  dearie 
hold tight
  if you see your reflection
your heart will take flight
  if you pick the right string
  then your heart
will take wing
  and there s nowhere to go
but up
 michael gasps 
oh   laughing 
father 
  now i feel like
that boy with a shiny new toy
  and there s nowhere to go
but up
 laughing 
michael 
  just one day at the fair
has me waltzing on air
  and there s nowhere to go
but up
jane  i remember 
it s all true 
every impossible thing we
imagined with mary poppins   
it all happened 
  now my heart is so light
  that i think i just might
  start feeding the birds
and then go fly a kite 
  with your head in a cloud
only laughter s allowed
  and there s nowhere to go
but up 
   all laugh 
  father 
you ve got to choose
your own balloons 
what balloon
are you going to have 
this one 
   children clamoring 
  i m going in the air 
 all exclaiming and cheering 
children 
  we re zigging and zagging
  our feet never dragging
  we might take a ride
to the moon
  all this bobbing and weaving
all comes from believing
  the magic inside the balloon
jack 
  the past is the past
  it lives on as history
  and that s
an important thing
  the future comes fast
each second a mystery
  for nobody knows
what tomorrow may bring
oh 
this one looks like you 
how do you know 
oh 
don t you lose her  son 
i won t  sir 
  up here in the blue
it s a marvelous view 
both    side by side
is the best way to fly
  once i just looked above
but now i am part of
  the lovely london sky 
would you like to try
one yourself  sir 
well  i ll give it a go 
all right  love 
choose carefully 
well  nowhere to go but up 
ellen 
  when the clouds make a muss
  well  i won t make a fuss
  but i ll polish the stars
all 
  ellen  better let us 
both    give a lift to a foe
for you reap what you sow
all    and there s
nowhere to go but up 
 gasps 
i ve set sail 
chart a course 
mr  binnacle 
that i will  sir 
 laughing 
 all cheering 
all 
  if your day s up the spout
  well  there isn t a doubt
  there s nowhere to go
but up
  and if you don t believe
just hang onto my sleeve
  for there s nowhere to go
but up
  as you fly over town
it gets harder to frown
  and we ll all
hit the heights
  if we never look down
  let the past take a bow
the forever is now
all    and there s nowhere
to go but up  up 
  there s nowhere to go
but up
 chuckles 
of course  the grown ups
will all forget by tomorrow 
they always do 
only one balloon left 
mary poppins 
i think
it must be yours 
yes  i suppose it must 
practically perfect
in every way 
welcome home  everyone 
jane  it s nice to be back 
isn t it 
michael   chuckles 
it is  it s so nice 
i never thought i d feel
this much joy and wonder
ever again 
i thought that door
was closed to me forever 
 children chattering
excitedly 
 children laughing 
john  come on  let s go 
annabel 
race you up the stairs 
john  no fair 
you got a head start 
georgie  oh  wait for me 
it s time 
she s gone 
hasn t she  michael 
thank you  mary poppins 
goodbye 
 chuckles 
i won t forget 
mary poppins  promise 
  so hold on tight
to those you love
  and maybe soon from up above
  you ll be blessed 
so keep on looking high
  while you re underneath
the lovely london
  sky
