of incarceration 
as a boy  i was afraid
of confined spaces 
i feared elevators 
when i was old enough  i just
wanted to get in the car 
roll the windows
and drive  drive   
drive wherever my eyes
would take me 
i was an american kid 
confinement of any kind
was terrifying to me 
so  to my surprise 
having been sentenced
to ten years in prison 
i found i adjusted quite well 
section seven 
full lockdown  800 hours 
i liked the routine 
i liked the regimen 
same activities 
same time  every day 
the same toothbrush 
the same clothes  same toilet 
same stale sweat  stale smoke 
stale bodies 
stale cooking  stale farts 
same conversations 
the faces change but not much 
no choice 
i found that i liked
reading books 
i d never read a book before   
not all the way through 
i found a life for myself that
had been beyond my imagination 
it was in prison
i learned to count cards 
what separates blackjack
from other games
is that it s based on
dependent events 
meaning past affects
the probability in the future 
the house has a 1 5  advantage 
if a player knows the nature
of the cards in the shoe 
he can turn the house advantage
to himself 
to do this  he has to
keep track of every card
that is played 
count is based on
a high low system 
high cards   
ten  jack  queen  king   
have a value of minus one 
if they are depleted 
player s advantage goes down 
the low cards   
two  three  four  five  six   
have a value of plus one 
the seven  eight and nine
have no count value 
the player keeps track
of every card
and calculates
the running count 
then the player arrives
at the true count 
which is the running count
divided by the decks remaining 
for example  if the
running count is plus nine
and there are four and a half
decks remaining 
nine over four and a half gives
you a true count of plus two 
as true count increases 
the player s advantage
increases 
the idea is to bet little when
you don t have the advantage 
more when you do 
well  that s about
enough for me 
  hey  man  good to see you 
  good playing with you 
again 
how we doing 
  hi  how are you 
  good 
and would you like large bills

usa  usa  usa  usa

may i join you 
be our guest 
i recognize you 
  we ve played before 
  yeah 
you know  i m gonna let you two
just    youngsters be 
i m gonna go play some dice 
all right 
  three times 
  no  four times 
horseshoe baltimore 
caesars atlantic city  foxwoods
  and harrah s philly 
  that s right 
you binked a gutshot straight
at foxwoods 
no explaining luck 
linda  right 
la linda 
ll  like  lucky lady  
ah  okay 
i ve watched you play 
you count cards  right 
i m not that smart 
but you win 
so you count cards 
how do you avoid
getting backed off 
i ve been backed off 
yet here you are 
yeah  well 
it s a matter of degree 
the house doesn t mind players
who count cards 
they don t even mind players
who count cards and win 
oh  i ll have a tom collins
with tanqueray 
  mm hmm  mm hmm 
  soda water  please 
what they don t like are players
who count cards and win big 
it s about how much you win
and how you win it 
i stick to modest goals 
that s what i wanted
to talk to you about 
what s your name again 
william tell 
i ve watched you play poker 
and i wonder why you play
at such low stakes 
you re a crackerjack 
i keep to modest goals 
no  there s no reason for that 
you can get someone
to stake you    an mtt   
make seven million payout 
that s what you do   
you you run a stable 
i m always looking
for a good thoroughbred 
i can get someone
to back you 100   on my word 
i prefer to work
under the radar 
i thought you were a gambler 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
  thanks 
  you re welcome 
so  bill   
you ever been to prison 
why would you say that 
i can tell
when someone s been inside 
it s a gift i have 
here s the problem
with a backer 
he puts up the money 
you split the winnings 
that s all good 
but if you lose 
you have to pay those losses
out of future winnings 
right  that only makes sense 
and slowly  you build weight 
you go to any poker website 
look up the top ten winners   
millions in earnings   
50  of them are underwater 
swamped in debt
they ll never repay 
if you don t play for money 
why do you play at all 
it passes the time 
so  bill   
   why don t you pass
some time with me 
let s play poker 
in poker  the player does not
play against the house 
he plays against other players 
the house takes a cut 
two things are necessary 
knowledge of
the mathematical odds 
knowledge of your opponents 
poker is all about waiting 
hours pass  days pass 
hand after hand 
each hand like the hand before 
then something happens 
there s a weight
a gambler can accrue
by accepting financial backing 
it s like any weight
a person in debt accrues 
it builds and builds 
has a life of its own 
there also is a moral weight
a man can accrue 
this is the weight created
by his past actions 
it is a weight   
   which can never be removed 
your attention  please 
the correctional officers
association mixer
  has been moved   
  nice playing with you 
welcome  sir 
polygraphs have
historically been
the problem child
of investigation
in law enforcement 
this may soon change 
vocat electronics has developed
a 22 point facial recognition
software   
   that uses
a proprietary algorithm
to interact with cqt detection 
this software  called stabl 
is in the beta testing phase 
vocat will soon be offering
a test version of this software
to qualified law enforcement
and public incarceration
agencies 
vocat makes no great claims
but thinks this advance
of potential truth detection
needs some field experience 
how reliable is it 
how does it work 
that s what i want
to get into now 
i prepared this
powerpoint demonstration
with a volunteer from the
milwaukee police department   
do you remember him 
   misclassifying innocent
subjects  false positives 
this is my number 
i m staying at this hotel 
cumulative research evidence
suggests
that cqt detects deception
better than chance
but with significant
error rates 
the smartest bet for a novice
is red black in roulette 
your odds are 47 4  
no more bets 
you win  you walk away 
you lose  you walk away 
it s the only smart casino bet 
14  red 
no 
where s my shoe 
hey  get the fuck back 
where s my shoe  guys 
shoe 
get the fuck back 
now 
get up 
hi 
johnnie walker  double  neat 
  please 
  you got it 
hello 
yeah  you gave me
a piece of paper
with your number on it
earlier tonight 
you awake 
i m here  i m at the bar 
the one by the elevators 
i ll wait 
you want a drink 
yeah  i ll have one of those 
another  the same 
sure 
let s sit 
so  what was that all about 
what 
you giving me a piece of paper
with your name and number on it 
you remember major john gordo 
of course 
he s not a major anymore 
he just uses that title 
what are you talking about 
pfc william tillich 
isn t that your name 
i ve done my research 
i know your case 
thank you 
  who are you 
  cirk baufort 
cirk with a  c  
my father was roger baufort 
gordo trained my father in the
arts of enhanced interrogation 
roger baufort 
that name doesn t ring a bell 
gordo was at abu ghraib 
as a private contractor 
my father  he visited him there 
is this story going anywhere 
the beauty of his scheme
was that gordo 
once he became
a private contractor 
he couldn t be prosecuted for
crimes not on american soil 
but my father   
wasn t so lucky 
he was dishonorably discharged 
got addicted to oxycodone 
he d been injured 
he drank heavily 
he beat my mother 
he beat me 
my mother left one day
without saying a word 
without a suitcase  just   
that left only me to beat 
until he shot himself 
that was four years ago 
so i decided i d just
get into it 
investigate it for myself 
find out what really happened 
set things straight 
what does your mother say 
she made her choice 
do you know where she is 
no 
and how am i involved in this 
well  there were
a handful of soldiers
that were bad apples 
who were punished 
but those who are
really responsible
are still walking around
out there 
giving lectures at conventions 
getting honorary degrees 
the apples weren t bad 
the barrel they came from
was bad 
you know  when i recognized you
at john gordo s seminar 
i recognized you instantly 
i thought to myself 
 here s a man who might want
a piece of what i m gonna do  
this is how it starts 
just a fleeting thought 
a daydream 
then it builds   
and builds 
and what is that 
capture him 
torture him and kill him 
they made you the fall guy 
they fucked you  pfc tillich 
  my name is tell 
  whatever 
you were in the photos 
no one else was prosecuted 
just the soldiers in the photos 
they put you in hell 
then they blamed you for it 
you got the barracks
at leavenworth 
and gordo got r and r in kuwait 
cirk   
you need to back off 
i ve spent a lot of time
thinking
the exact same thoughts
you re thinking right now 
they eat you up 
are you gonna tell on me 
no 
i m not 
it s your life 
cirk with a  c  
it s bill tell 
you want to ride with me 
i m a card player 
i go from city to city 
casino to casino 
card room to card room 
it gets lonely 
i d like some company 
i ll cover the costs 
who is it 
tell 
bill 
come on in 
you live like this 
well  i was packing 
all right  let s get your shit
together  get on the road 
turn it off 
ah  come on

who are you  god 
if you d ever actually
been there 
you d never want to hear
that shit again in your life 
so  where are we going 
you never told me 
you never asked 
there s a racino
at delaware park 
delaware casinos are tied
into race tracks 
i m not really into
playing cards 
do you like sports 
yeah 
well  they have
a great sports book 
yeah  but that costs money 
i mean   
how much is it gonna cost me 
 cause i can t really go around
spending my money like that
on sports betting 
who is this insolent
little prick 
i did play fantasy football
with the guys a while back 
but   
i don t suppose that counts 
what about college 
what happened there 
it wasn t for me 
how much debt you got 
some 
a lot 
and you want to go back 
i got out of the mood 
do you have any interests 
what do you mean 
interests  like   
anything you want to do 
an occupation  a business 
i got interests 
sports betting is
a world unto itself 
there s a hundred games
going on around the world
at any given moment 
that s a lot of information 
but the algorithms here
at the house are faster
and better
and quicker than you 
so unless you have
inside information 
sports betting is just for fun 
here s a couple hundred bucks 
you pick two teams 
place some bets  have some fun 
i m gonna go play
some blackjack 
here s walking around money 
just  uh  a second 
it s just a little damn noisy
out there 
oh  that s a lot better 
hey  la linda  you there 
uh  i m at delaware raceway 
electricians 
so  uh  i ve been thinking
about what you were saying
and having some second thoughts 
i might be interested in  uh 
in what what you were
talking about 
yeah  i realize that 
i just think that we could take
the conversation to the   
the next step 
after this  back up to ac 
okay 
all right 
is there an end to punishment 
is there a limit to
the amount of effort it takes
to merit expiation 
is it possible to know
when one reaches the limit 
well  here she is 
madam 
join us 
la linda  i d like
to introduce you
to the young man
formerly known as cirk baufort 
now we just call him the kid 
yep  that s cirk with a  c

  pleased to meet you  kid 
king of sports book  the kid is 
yesterday  played two games

  others don t care 
  mm hmm 
i ll find something
that suits you 
i build my nest egg  i bail 
one year max  then i m out 
i wish i could believe that 
believe 
i m too old for this 
  mwah  bye 
  bye 
the other day  you asked me 
 what was the greatest hand
of poker ever played  
and i can only speak
for what i have seen 
and this   
is the best hand i ever saw 
2012  indian casino in iowa 
blackbird bend  omaha nation 
10k tournament 
goldie    asian player 
wore a lot of gold   
and alex karesco 
wsop champion 
you may have heard of him 
alex has pocket queens 
clubs and diamonds 
goldie has
eight  nine of diamonds 
how d you do that 
practice  i was in a place
where i had a lot of time
on my hands 
now the flop 
ten of spades 
jack of diamonds 
queen of hearts 
there s blood in the water 
both players think
they re ahead 
it goes check  raise 
reraise  re reraise 
call 
alex and goldie head to head 
now the turn 
ten of diamonds  now   
there is only one card
that gets goldie out 
there s a two percent chance
the river will come
the seven of diamonds 
alex has a 98  chance of winning
with queens full of tens 
goldie looks at the damage 
he doesn t even have
a pot sized bet left behind 
makes this little sucking sound
that the japanese do 
then he goes all in 
alex calls 
now the river 
seven of diamonds 
straight flush beats
a full house  goldie wins 
you saw that game 
haven t been to iowa since 
could you top us off  please 
so this  um   
   this plan you have
about major john gordo   
you given it more thought 
he s all nails 
you re not 
he s right out of fucking
call of duty 
how you gonna do that 
well   
there would need to be
a tranquilizer 
ketamine  combined with telazol 
it can be administered
by a dart pistol 
where d you find out about this 
  the internet 
  and you have it 
just the ketamine 
but it s amazing how easy
the stuff is to get 
i mean  i ordered it on a lark 
three days later  it arrived 
this isn t
very well thought out 
and that s why i need a partner 
somebody with experience 
somebody with expertise 
and motive 
a strong guy 
a guy like you 
let s   
roll back your scenario
for a moment 
you ve located john gordo 
you shot him with a dart 
he s gaga 
what next 
strip him naked 
put a hood over his head 
one of those green
military sandbags 
you can find them on ebay 
handcuff him 
hang him from the ceiling 
keep him from sleeping 
make him try to jerk off
while i hit him in the legs 
did your father tell you
about this 
no  he never talked about it 
he kept it all inside 
he beat you 
that s in the past 
the body remembers 
it stores it all 
do you want to hear about it 
would that interest you 
  what 
  you know what 
you re dying to hear 
the noise 
the smell 
feces  urine 
oil  explosives 
bleach  sweat  smoke 
all day  every day 
sand spiders  camel spiders 
ants as big as cockroaches 
the heat  the fear 
the adrenaline jack  mortars 
the sheer noise of it 
and blood 
and the only way to survive
was to rise above 
rise and laugh 
surf the craziness 
to see a grown man shit
and piss on himself 
sing the song  man 
the noise  the fucking noise 
the noise 
we were all just trapped
in there 
in the same shit 
sh sh    shithole 
them and us 
and am i trying to justify
what we did 
no 
nothing   
nothing can justify
what we did 
your father understood that 
if you were there 
you could understand 
otherwise  there s no   
understanding 
minnesota 
when was the last time 
orlando 
oxford downs  that s right 
  you were with clickity dick 
  usa  usa 
i d like to put a cap
in that motherfucker 
now  take it smooth  minnie 
and exercise those legs 
they call him minnesota fats
after the movie 
you know  there s not
a lot of fat people
that play
professional poker anymore 
i like to call him
charlie two chins 
why is that 
 cause he got more chins
than a chinese phone book 
thanks for the straight line 
minnesota fats played pool
in that movie 
  no  poker 
  no  that s cincinnati kid 
oh  whatever 
the preferred poker variant
for multi table tournaments
is no limit texas hold em 
it encourages large pots
and large raises 
the prize money is split
between the top five players 
before the hole cards are dealt 
the player to the left
of the button must post
small and big blinds 
this stimulates action  and
the blinds go up every hour 
the rest of the cards
are common cards 
the flop  three cards 
1 800 
the turn 
and the river 
the river can instantly turn
a losing hand into a winner 
that s hold em s
betting appeal 
all in 
what happened  you get bored 
played some slots 
you should read some books 
i m gonna buy you one 
i ve read books 
what is it with her 
  name one

5 000 what 
5 000 grains of rice

those are tournament chips 
we just call them dollars 
it s good publicity 
so  how much is it 
depends on the buy in
and the split 
a game like this 
there s about 500 000 in play 
the winner will get 150 
runner up anywhere 70 to 80

the narrative was broken 
so  how long s it been

even seeing them
on the highway here 
looking at it and   
you realize 
 oh  my god  that s a prison  
my dad used to send my mom
letters from bagram 
and she d cry 
there s something
quite similar in poker 
you know the phrase  tilt  
yeah 
when a player gets
caught up in winning 
plays outside his zone 
just like in pinball 
and there s something similar
in interrogations 
it s called  force drift  
it happens when
the interrogator applies
more and more force to
the prisoner with less results 
the interrogator
becomes intoxicated
by frustration and power 
any man can tilt 
i can tilt 
your father can tilt 
you can tilt 
i said ride with me 
you did 
you came along 
what do you think we re up to 
you and me
