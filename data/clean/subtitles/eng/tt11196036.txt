of incarceration
as a boy i was afraid
of confined spaces
i feared elevators
when i was old enough i just
wanted to get in the car
roll the windows
and drive drive
drive wherever my eyes
would take me
i was an american kid
confinement of any kind
was terrifying to me
so to my surprise
having been sentenced
to ten years in prison
i found i adjusted quite well
section seven
full lockdown 800 hours
i liked the routine
i liked the regimen
same activities
same time every day
the same toothbrush
the same clothes same toilet
same stale sweat stale smoke
stale bodies
stale cooking stale farts
same conversations
the faces change but not much
no choice
i found that i liked
reading books
id never read a book before
not all the way through
i found a life for myself that
had been beyond my imagination
it was in prison
i learned to count cards
what separates blackjack
from other games
is that its based on
dependent events
meaning past affects
the probability in the future
the house has a 15 advantage
if a player knows the nature
of the cards in the shoe
he can turn the house advantage
to himself
to do this he has to
keep track of every card
that is played
count is based on
a highlow system
high cards
ten jack queen king
have a value of minusone
if they are depleted
players advantage goes down
the low cards
two three four five six
have a value of plusone
the seven eight and nine
have no count value
the player keeps track
of every card
and calculates
the running count
then the player arrives
at the true count
which is the running count
divided by the decks remaining
for example if the
running count is plusnine
and there are four and a half
decks remaining
nine over four and a half gives
you a true count of plustwo
as true count increases
the players advantage
increases
the idea is to bet little when
you dont have the advantage
more when you do
well thats about
enough for me
hey man good to see you
good playing with you
again
how we doing
hi how are you
good

thats right
you binked a gutshot straight
at foxwoods
no explaining luck
linda right
la linda
ll like lucky lady
ah okay
ive watched you play
you count cards right
im not that smart
but you win
so you count cards
how do you avoid
getting backed off
ive been backed off
yet here you are
yeah well
its a matter of degree
the house doesnt mind players
who count cards
they dont even mind players
who count cards and win
oh ill have a tom collins
with tanqueray
mmhmm mmhmm
soda water please
what they dont like are players
who count cards and win big
its about how much you win
and how you win it
i stick to modest goals
thats what i wanted
to talk to you about
whats your name again
william tell
ive watched you play poker
and i wonder why you play
at such low stakes
youre a crackerjack
i keep to modest goals
no theres no reason for that
you can get someone
to stake you an mtt
make seven million payout
thats what you do
youyou run a stable
im always looking
for a good thoroughbred
i can get someone
to back you 100 on my word
i prefer to work
under the radar
i thought you were a gambler
thank you
youre welcome
thanks
youre welcome
so bill
you ever been to prison
why would you say that
i can tell
when someones been inside
its a gift i have
heres the problem
with a backer
he puts up the money
you split the winnings
thats all good
but if you lose
you have to pay those losses
out of future winnings
right that only makes sense
and slowly you build weight
you go to any poker website
look up the top ten winners
millions in earnings
50 of them are underwater
swamped in debt
theyll never repay
if you dont play for money
why do you play at all
it passes the time
so bill
why dont you pass
some time with me
lets play poker
in poker the player does not
play against the house
he plays against other players
the house takes a cut
two things are necessary
knowledge of
the mathematical odds
knowledge of your opponents
poker is all about waiting
hours pass days pass
hand after hand
each hand like the hand before
then something happens
theres a weight
a gambler can accrue
by accepting financial backing
its like any weight
a person in debt accrues
it builds and builds
has a life of its own
there also is a moral weight
a man can accrue
this is the weight created
by his past actions
it is a weight
which can never be removed
your attention please
the correctional officers
association mixer
has been moved
nice playing with you
welcome sir
polygraphs have
historically been
the problem child
of investigation
in law enforcement
this may soon change
vocat electronics has developed
a 22point facial recognition
software
that uses
a proprietary algorithm
to interact with cqt detection
this software called stabl
is in the beta testing phase
vocat will soon be offering
a test version of this software
to qualified law enforcement
and public incarceration
agencies
vocat makes no great claims
but thinks this advance
of potential truth detection
needs some field experience
how reliable is it
how does it work
thats what i want
to get into now
i prepared this
powerpoint demonstration
with a volunteer from the
milwaukee police department
do you remember him
misclassifying innocent
subjects false positives
this is my number
im staying at this hotel
cumulative research evidence
suggests
that cqt detects deception
better than chance
but with significant
error rates
the smartest bet for a novice
is redblack in roulette
your odds are 474
no more bets
you win you walk away
you lose you walk away
its the only smart casino bet
14 red
no
wheres my shoe
hey get the fuck back
wheres my shoe guys
shoe
get the fuck back
now
get up
hi
johnnie walker double neat
please
you got it
hello
yeah you gave me
a piece of paper
with your number on it
earlier tonight
you awake
im here im at the bar
the one by the elevators
ill wait
you want a drink
yeah ill have one of those
another the same
sure
lets sit
so what was that all about
what
you giving me a piece of paper
with your name and number on it
you remember major john gordo
of course
hes not a major anymore
he just uses that title
what are you talking about
pfc william tillich
isnt that your name
ive done my research
i know your case
thank you
who are you
cirk baufort
cirk with a c
my father was roger baufort
gordo trained my father in the
arts of enhanced interrogation
roger baufort
that name doesnt ring a bell
gordo was at abu ghraib
as a private contractor
my father he visited him there
is this story going anywhere
the beauty of his scheme
was that gordo
once he became
a private contractor
he couldnt be prosecuted for
crimes not on american soil
but my father
wasnt so lucky
he was dishonorably discharged
got addicted to oxycodone
hed been injured
he drank heavily
he beat my mother
he beat me
my mother left one day
without saying a word
without a suitcase just
that left only me to beat
until he shot himself
that was four years ago
so i decided id just
get into it
investigate it for myself
find out what really happened
set things straight
what does your mother say
she made her choice
do you know where she is
no
and how am i involved in this
well there were
a handful of soldiers
that were bad apples
who were punished
but those who are
really responsible
are still walking around
out there
giving lectures at conventions
getting honorary degrees
the apples werent bad
the barrel they came from
was bad
you know when i recognized you
at john gordos seminar
i recognized you instantly
i thought to myself
heres a man who might want
a piece of what im gonna do
this is how it starts
just a fleeting thought
a daydream
then it builds
and builds
and what is that
capture him
torture him and kill him
they made you the fall guy
they fucked you pfc tillich
my name is tell
whatever
you were in the photos
no one else was prosecuted
just the soldiers in the photos
they put you in hell
then they blamed you for it
you got the barracks
at leavenworth
and gordo got r and r in kuwait
cirk
you need to back off
ive spent a lot of time
thinking
the exact same thoughts
youre thinking right now
they eat you up
are you gonna tell on me
no
im not
its your life
cirk with a c
its bill tell
you want to ride with me
im a card player
i go from city to city
casino to casino
card room to card room
it gets lonely
id like some company
ill cover the costs
who is it
tell
bill
come on in
you live like this
well i was packing
all right lets get your shit
together get on the road
turn it off
ah come on
turn that shit off
who are you god
if youd ever actually
been there
youd never want to hear
that shit again in your life
so where are we going
you never told me
you never asked
theres a racino
at delaware park
delaware casinos are tied
into race tracks
im not really into
playing cards
do you like sports
yeah
well they have
a great sports book
yeah but that costs money
i mean
how much is it gonna cost me
cause i cant really go around
spending my money like that
on sports betting
who is this insolent
little prick
i did play fantasy football
with the guys a while back
but
i dont suppose that counts
what about college
what happened there
it wasnt for me
how much debt you got
some
a lot
and you want to go back
i got out of the mood
do you have any interests
what do you mean
interests like
anything you want to do
an occupation a business
i got interests
sports betting is
a world unto itself
theres a hundred games
going on around the world
at any given moment
thats a lot of information
but the algorithms here
at the house are faster
and better
and quicker than you
so unless you have
inside information
sports betting is just for fun
heres a couple hundred bucks
you pick two teams
place some bets have some fun
im gonna go play
some blackjack
heres walkingaround money
just uh a second
its just a little damn noisy
out there
oh thats a lot better
hey la linda you there
uh im at delaware raceway
electricians
so uh ive been thinking
about what you were saying
and having some second thoughts
i might be interested in uh
in whatwhat you were
talking about
yeah i realize that
i just think that we could take
the conversation to the
the next step
after this back up to ac
okay
all right
is there an end to punishment
is there a limit to
the amount of effort it takes
to merit expiation
is it possible to know
when one reaches the limit
well here she is
madam
join us
la linda id like
to introduce you
to the young man
formerly known as cirk baufort
now we just call him the kid
yep thats cirk with a c
yeah
pleased to meet you kid
king of sports book the kid is
yesterday played two games
hit em both on a double pop
oh give me some of your luck
uh la linda and i just have
something we want to discuss
maybe
yeah
ill uh
give the slots a whirl
all right
bet small lose small
hes a good kid
what was this thing
you wanted to talk about
uh well i may want
to build up a nest egg
and uh to do that
i need a backer
well thats a dramatic turn
you woke something in me
i dont know
its the kid he needs help
and money will do that
hes got debts
so where do we start
well jump on one
of these wsop tours
they got an event every week
and youll come up fast
if youre willing to travel
i am
well start
on the east coast for now
tease em
vegas
thats where the money is
do i have to meet the backer
for some people
its an ego thing
others dont care
mmhmm
ill find something
that suits you
i build my nest egg i bail
one year max then im out
i wish i could believe that
believe
im too old for this
mwah bye
bye
the other day you asked me
what was the greatest hand
of poker ever played
and i can only speak
for what i have seen
and this
is the best hand i ever saw
2012 indian casino in iowa
blackbird bend omaha nation
10k tournament
goldie asian player
wore a lot of gold
and alex karesco
wsop champion
you may have heard of him
alex has pocket queens
clubs and diamonds
goldie has
eight nine of diamonds
howd you do that
practice i was in a place
where i had a lot of time
on my hands
now the flop
ten of spades
jack of diamonds
queen of hearts
theres blood in the water
both players think
theyre ahead
it goes check raise
reraise rereraise
call
alex and goldie headtohead
now the turn
ten of diamonds now
there is only one card
that gets goldie out
theres a two percent chance
the river will come
the seven of diamonds
alex has a 98 chance of winning
with queens full of tens
goldie looks at the damage
he doesnt even have
a potsized bet left behind
makes this little sucking sound
that the japanese do
then he goes all in
alex calls
now the river
seven of diamonds
straight flush beats
a full house goldie wins
you saw that game
havent been to iowa since
could you top us off please
so this um
this plan you have
about major john gordo
you given it more thought
hes all nails
youre not
hes right out of fucking
call of duty
how you gonna do that
well
there would need to be
a tranquilizer
ketamine combined with telazol
it can be administered
by a dart pistol
whered you find out about this
the internet
and you have it
just the ketamine
but its amazing how easy
the stuff is to get
i mean i ordered it on a lark
three days later it arrived
this isnt
very well thought out
and thats why i need a partner
somebody with experience
somebody with expertise
and motive
a strong guy
a guy like you
lets
roll back your scenario
for a moment
youve located john gordo
you shot him with a dart
hes gaga
what next
strip him naked
put a hood over his head
one of those green
military sandbags
you can find them on ebay
handcuff him
hang him from the ceiling
keep him from sleeping
make him try to jerk off
while i hit him in the legs
did your father tell you
about this
no he never talked about it
he kept it all inside
he beat you
thats in the past
the body remembers
it stores it all
do you want to hear about it
would that interest you
what
you know what
youre dying to hear
the noise
the smell
feces urine
oil explosives
bleach sweat smoke
all day every day
sand spiders camel spiders
ants as big as cockroaches
the heat the fear
the adrenaline jack mortars
the sheer noise of it
and blood
and the only way to survive
was to rise above
rise and laugh
surf the craziness
to see a grown man shit
and piss on himself
sing the song man
the noise the fucking noise
the noise
we were all just trapped
in there
in the same shit
shsh shithole
them and us
and am i trying to justify
what we did
no
nothing
nothing can justify
what we did
your father understood that
if you were there
you could understand
otherwise theres no
understanding
minnesota
when was the last time
orlando
oxford downs thats right
you were with clickity dick
usa usa
id like to put a cap
in that motherfucker
now take it smooth minnie
and exercise those legs
they call him minnesota fats
after the movie
you know theres not
a lot of fat people
that play
professional poker anymore
i like to call him
charlie two chins
why is that
cause he got more chins
than a chinese phone book
thanks for the straight line
minnesota fats played pool
in that movie
no poker
no thats cincinnati kid
oh whatever
the preferred poker variant
for multitable tournaments
is nolimit texas holdem
it encourages large pots
and large raises
the prize money is split
between the top five players
before the hole cards are dealt
the player to the left
of the button must post
small and big blinds
this stimulates action and
the blinds go up every hour
the rest of the cards
are common cards
the flop three cards
the turn
and the river
the river can instantly turn
a losing hand into a winner
thats holdems
betting appeal
all in
what happened you get bored
played some slots
you should read some books
im gonna buy you one
ive read books
what is it with her
name one
one what
book
how bout poker for dummies
i believe you may have read it
i like him
wow you made it
to the second dinner break
i must have fired
two dozen tournaments
before i lasted that long
so how many are left
four tables
so should be done tomorrow
how much cards do you play
40 hands an hour
eight to 12 hours a day
six to seven days a week
do you do anything else
like what
like anything
go to a park
a concert a museum
museum
yeah
ill buy you a book on it
its called
museums for dummies
badumbum
no but seriously
you should do something else
just for variety
i like playing cards
usa
usa usa usa
thats 800000
where do they get their money
geez louise
slow down kid
you see the purple chips
what do they say
5000 what
5000 grains of rice
thats not money
those are tournament chips
we just call them dollars
its good publicity
so how much is it
depends on the buyin
and the split
a game like this
theres about 500000 in play
the winner will get 150
runnerup anywhere 70 to 80

his real name was john rodgers
john gordo came
sometime later
he was born in georgia
he first came to the attention
of the cia
during the contra
counterinsurgency
he was trained in interrogation
in nicaragua
from there he entered
the sere program
survival evasion
resistance and escape
the program was devised
to help captured us soldiers
withstand hostile
interrogations
get the fuck up get up
they were put
into stress conditions
sensory deprivation
confinement in close spaces
given bombardment with
dangerous decibels of noise
starvation sleep deprivation
and sexual humiliation
after the foreign fighters at
the guantanamo detention camp
were unresponsive
to interrogations
a decision was made
to reverse engineer
the lessons learned
in the sere program
sere psych op instructors
were brought to gitmo
to devise enhanced
interrogation techniques
one of the first to arrive
was consultant john gordo
now a civilian
lessons learned at gitmo
were conveyed
to interrogation black sites
around the world
in 2003 a decision was made
to gitmoize
the civilian prisons
at bagram airfield
and abu ghraib
civilian consultant john gordo
arrived in may
did you go to college tillich
community college two years

creativity there

but why dont they just
use their own money
opm
other peoples money
casino the tv the websites
they all want big pots
its entertainment
hey where are we going anyway
i thought saint louis
was back that way
taking a detour
were gonna take a little trip
down memory lane
this was my home
for eight and a half years
since we were near
i thought wed drop by
up there second floor
202 b pod
i got my own place
after the first year
then um
another place
on the other side
you know that fella
i told you about
the one i wanted you to meet
hes here
thought id pay him a visit
ive arranged it
want to join
go into a military prison
no no thanks
well its pretty good
as far as prisons go
you know built in 2002
things still work like toilets
shit man i mean
you walk in there
and those doors close
behind you thats fucking it
im going in
come on
think of it as a field trip
as a teachable moment
ill wait in the car
im inviting you
i aint going
just park the car
hey you ever been
on google earth
what is that
its where i was when i was
waiting for you its amazing
look you can enter any place
in the world
it comes right up
street view
look at that
290 great hills road
rockville virginia
the house the surroundings
latitude longitude
thats john gordos house
front entrance back entrance
you still got him on the brain
yes sir
i dont think thats
such a great idea
howd it go at leavenworth
you still pissed at me
hey wasnt la linda
supposed to meet us here
yeah
shell be here tomorrow
meet us in saint louis
then do a deep stacks
in biloxi
tunica and on to panama city
you like her huh
yeah
yeah me too
you ever been married
when i was in the service
i was a bit of a ladies man
thought i was
but uh
then the other stuff happened
the narrative was broken
so how longs it been
since you got laid
how long has it been
since youve seen your mother
i wouldnt know
where to find her
thats bullshit
what business is it
of yours anyway
you remember her
sure
yeah she reach out to you
she try and contact you
ill make you a deal kid
you go see your mother
and ill fucking get laid
about earlier
i dont like prisons
even seeing them
on the highway here
looking at it and
you realize
oh my god thats a prison
my dad used to send my mom
letters from bagram
and shed cry
theres something
quite similar in poker
you know the phrase tilt
yeah
when a player gets
caught up in winning
plays outside his zone
just like in pinball
and theres something similar
in interrogations
its called force drift
it happens when
the interrogator applies
more and more force to
the prisoner with less results
the interrogator
becomes intoxicated
