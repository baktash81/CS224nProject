look  what are you guys  the cops 
what s the point of the league  coach 
to teach kids it s okay to lie  as

i wanted to give a few more people the
opportunity to say something on   
on jarius  behalf 
please  mr o neill  come on up 
good morning 
 clears throat 
jarius was a player   
on the kekambas baseball team
that i coach 
honestly  he  uh   
he was too young to play 
but he wanted to be a part of
the team so badly that  uh   
i couldn t say no 
g baby  you re up 
he had a great smile too 
i know i m not telling you
anything you don t know 
i ve got jarius evans
batting for jefferson tibbs 
he was a really tough guy 
just a boy  really  who  uh   
wanted to be around his older brother 
hang on  coach  i don t have jarius
evans on this roster anywhere 
oh  you know what 
there he is  he s okay 
the other day   
we played a really important
game against a good team 
and  two outs in the last inning   
g baby 
   i had no choice but to let jarius bat 
you can swing if you want 
but you don t have to 
okay  if you go down looking 
none of us care 
but if you want to swing  swing 
get back in there  do what you feel 
okay 
he was fearless
as he stepped to the plate 
i was terrified for him 
with two strikes
and our hopes dwindling   
he hit a shot down the first baseline 
we won the game 
and watching him   
raise his arms in triumph   
as he ran to first base 
i swear   
i was lifted in that moment
to a better place 
i swear he  uh   
he lifted the world in that moment 
he made me a    better person   
even if just for that moment 
i am  uh   
forever grateful to jarius for that 
that was nice  what you said 
his mother was very moved  thank you

to you about the baseball team
