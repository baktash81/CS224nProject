elizabeth i get paid under
the table to coach that team
and i only do that because im
in a big hole with two bookies
who are lookin to kill me yeah
what nothing
you know all this
i spoke to jimmy fleming after
jefferson got beat up he told me
you just think im a big joke no
its people like me that make people like
you feel better about your tiny life
this is unbelievable i cant
believe i came down here for this
yeah then why did you come
if you know im a liar
because those kids trust you
and they dont trust anybody
i told you i coach for money
well i teach for money ive had some
of the best fifthgraders in the world
but some of them dont make it because they dont
have anybody besides their mother or me
telling them what to do
so what
im done with all that
well i just came down here

here they are
what are the names of those two boys at second base
andre and jamal

this birth certificates been altered
what
the eights been turned into a nine
you have to be born
after september of 88
well the kid is out of the league
and the kekambas are on probation
look what are you guys the cops
whats the point of the league coach
to teach kids its okay to lie as
long as they can get away with it
it should be about
these kids playing ball
not the trophy you bring to work
look the kid goes now
okay
jefferson bats seventh plays first base
miles pitches and bats eighth and
clarence you play third and bat ninth

on the kekambas baseball team

the team so badly that uh
i couldnt say no
gbaby youre up

just a boy really who uh
wanted to be around his older brother
hang on coach i dont have jarius
evans on this roster anywhere
oh you know what
there he is hes okay
the other day
we played a really important
game against a good team
and two outs in the last inning
gbaby
i had no choice but to let jarius bat
you can swing if you want
but you dont have to
okay if you go down looking
none of us care
but if you want to swing swing
get back in there do what you feel
okay
he was fearless
as he stepped to the plate
i was terrified for him
with two strikes
and our hopes dwindling
he hit a shot down the first baseline
we won the game
and watching him
raise his arms in triumph
as he ran to first base
i swear
i was lifted in that moment
to a better place
i swear he uh
he lifted the world in that moment
he made me a better person
even if just for that moment
i am uh
forever grateful to jarius for that
