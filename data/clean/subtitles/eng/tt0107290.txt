stand back 
bring it
forward  come on 
slow it down 
  pushing team  move in there 
  move in 
  on your ready 
  i want tasers on full charge 
steady 
go on  step back in 
ready  move it 
and push 
locked  loading team 
step away 
move it 
jophery  raise the gate 
block the opening 
don t let her get out 
somebody help him 
work her back 
shoot her 
i heard that hammond s
not even here 
he sends his apologies 
there s a  20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker
and you re telling me
that hammond can t see me 
he had to leave early  his
daughter s getting a divorce 
i understand  but we need to
deal with the situation now 
the insurance company   
you okay 
the underwriters feel that the accident s
raised safety questions about the park 
that makes the investors
very anxious 
i had to promise to conduct a very
thorough  on site inspection 
hammond hates inspections 
they slow everything down 
i need to or they ll
pull the funding 
that ll slow him down
even more 
watch your head 
if two experts sign off
on the island 
the insurance guys
will back off 
i ve already got ian malcolm 
but they think he s too trendy 
they want alan grant 
grant 
you ll never get him
out of montana 
why not 
why not 
because grant s like me 
he s a digger 
dr  grant  dr  sattler 
we re ready to try again 
i hate computers 
the feeling s mutual 
take a look 
did it work 
how long
does this take 
should bring
an immediate return 
you shoot the radar
into the ground 
and the bone bounces
the image back 
bounces it back   
this new program
is incredible 
a few more
years  development 
and we won t even
have to dig anymore 
where s the fun
in that 
it s a little distorted  but i
don t think it s the computer 
post mortem contraction of the
posterior neck ligaments 
velociraptor 
yes  good shape  too 
it s five  six feet high 
i m guessing nine feet long 
look   
what d you do 
he touched it 
dr  grant s not
machine compatible 
hell  they ve got it
in for me 
and look at the half moon
shaped bones in the wrists 
it s no wonder these guys
learned how to fly 
no  seriously 
maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
present day birds than with reptiles 
look at the pubic bone  turned
backward  just like a bird 
look at the vertebrae  full of air
sacs and hollows  like a bird 
and even the word  raptor 
means  bird of prey  
that doesn t
look very scary 
more like a 6 foot turkey 
a turkey 
imagine yourself in the
cretaceous period 
here we go 
you d get your first look at this
6 foot turkey as you enter a clearing 
he moves like a bird 
lightly bobbing his head 
you keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement 
like t rex and he ll lose
you if you don t move 
but no 
not velociraptor 
you stare at him and he
just stares right back 
and that s when
the attack comes 
not from the front 
but from the side 
from the other two raptors you
didn t even know were there 
because velociraptor s
a pack hunter 
he uses coordinated
attack patterns
and he is out
in force today 
and he slashes at you
with this 
a 6 inch retractable claw  like
a razor  on the middle toe 
he doesn t bother to bite
your jugular like a lion  no 
he slashes at you
here or here   
alan 
or maybe across the belly 
spilling your intestines 
the point is  you are alive
when they start to eat you 
so  you know  try to
show a little respect 
okay 
alan  if you wanted
to scare the kid 
you could ve pulled
a gun on him 
yeah  i know  kids 
you want to have
one of those 
i don t want that kid 
but a breed of the child
could be intriguing 
i mean  what s so
wrong with kids 
they re noisy  they re
messy  they re expensive 
cheap  cheap 
they smell 
they don t smell 
some smell 
give me a break 
babies smell 
cover the site 
cover up the dig 
tell them to shut down 
cut the machine 
cover it all up 
pull it over 
just cut it  will you 
shut it down 
what 
what the hell do you think
you re doing in here 
we were saving that 
for today  i guarantee it 
who in god s name
do you think you are 
john hammond 
and i m delighted to meet you
finally in person  dr  grant 
so  i can see that my  50 000
a year has been well spent 
who s the jerk 
this is our paleobotanist 
dr   
sattler 
ellie  this
is mr  hammond 
i m sorry about the dramatic
entrance  dr  sattler  but   
did i say  jerk  
   we re in a hurry 
will you have a drink  we won t
let it get warm  sit down 
let me have this 
i ll just get a glass or two  i can do it 
there s samples
all over here 
i know my way
around the kitchen 
now  i ll get right
to the point 
i like you 
both of you 
i can tell instantly about people 
it s a gift 
i own an island off the
coast of costa rica 
i ve leased it from the government
and during the last five years 
i ve been setting up
a biological preserve 
really spectacular 
spared no expense 
make the one i ve got down in
kenya look like a petting zoo 
and there s no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds 
and what are those 
small versions of
adults  honey 
and not just kids 
everyone 
we re going to open next year  if
the lawyers don t kill me first 
i don t care for
lawyers  do you 
i don t really know any 
don t really know any 
i do  there s a particular pebble in
my shoe  who represents my investors 
says that they insist
on outside opinions 
what kind of opinions 
well  your kind  not to put
too fine a point on it 
let s face it  in your particular
fields  you re the top minds 
and if i could just
persuade you
to sign off on the park 
give it your endorsement 
maybe even pen a wee testimonial 
i could get back on schedule 
why would they care
what we think 
what kind of park
is this 
it s right up your alley 
why don t you come down  just the
pair of you  for the weekend 
i d love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well 
i ve got a jet
standing by at choteau 
i m sorry 
this isn t possible 
we just dug up
a new skeleton   
i could compensate you
by fully funding your dig   
this is a very unusual time 
the timing is   
   for a further
three years 
where s the plane 
okay 
three years 
cheers 
dodgson 
you shouldn t use my name 
dodgson  we ve got
dodgson here 
see  nobody cares 
nice hat 
what re you trying to look
like  a secret agent 
well 
 750 000 
on delivery   50 000 more
for each viable embryo 
that s  1 5 million if you get
all 15 species off the island 
i ll get them all 
remember  viable embryos  they re
no use to us if they don t survive 
how am i supposed
to transport them 
the bottom screws open 
that s great 
oh  my god 
it s cooled and
compartmentalized inside 
you guys 
that s great 
customs can even check it
if they want to 
let me see 
go on 
there s enough coolant
for 36 hours 
no menthol 
the embryos have to be back
here in san jos√© by then 
that s up to your guy
on the boat 
7 00 tomorrow night on the east dock 
make sure he gets it right 
how are you planning
to beat security 
i ve got
an 18 minute window 
eighteen minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research 
don t get cheap on me 
dodgson 
that was
hammond s mistake 
so you two
dig up dinosaurs 
well   
we try to 
you ll have to get
used to dr  malcolm 
he suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality 
especially for
a mathematician 
chaotician  chaotician 
actually 
john doesn t subscribe
to chaos 
particularly what it says
about his science project 
ian  you ve never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns   
because of the behavior
of the system in phase space 
a load  if i may say so  of
fashionable number crunching   
don t 
dr  sattler  dr  grant 
you ve heard of chaos theory 
no 
no  non linear equations 
strange attractors 
i refuse to believe that you aren t
familiar with the concept of attraction 
i bring scientists 
you bring a rock star 
there it is 
bad wind shears 
we have to drop pretty fast 
hold on  this will
be thrilling 
but you need that piece over
here  and that piece   
we ll have landed
by the time you get it right 
great 
the full 50 miles of perimeter
fence are in place 
and the concrete moats  and the
motion sensor tracking systems 
donald  dear boy  relax 
try and enjoy yourself 
let s get this straight  this
is not a weekend excursion 
this is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island 
your investors  whom i
represent  are deeply concerned 
forty eight hours from now  if they re
not convinced  i m not convinced 
i ll shut you down  john 
in 48 hours  i ll be
accepting your apologies 
all right  slow down 
slow  stop 
this shouldn t be here 
alan  this species of
veriforman has been extinct
since the cretaceous period 
i mean  this thing   
what 
look at that 
it s a dinosaur 
you did it  crazy son
of a bitch  you did it 
we could tear up the rule book on
cold bloodedness  it doesn t apply 
they re wrong  this is
a warm blooded creature 
this thing doesn t
live in a swamp 
this thing s got
a 25  27 foot neck 
the brachiosaurus 
30 
thirty feet 
we re gonna make
a fortune with this place 
how fast are they 
well  we clocked the t rex
at 32 miles an hour 
t rex 
you said you ve
got a t rex 
say again 
we have a t rex 
put your head
between your knees 
dr  grant 
my dear dr  sattler 
welcome to jurassic park 
they re moving in herds 
they do move in herds 
how did you do this 
i ll show you 
good day 
the most advanced amusement
park in the entire world 
incorporating all
the latest technologies 
and i m not talking just about rides 
everybody has rides 
no  we ve made living biological
attractions so astounding
that they ll capture the
imagination of the entire planet 
so  what are you thinking 
that we re out of a job 
don t you mean  extinct  
why don t you all sit down 
donald  sit down 
here he comes 
well  here i come 
hello 
say hello 
hello 
hello  john 
yes  i ve got lines 
well  fine  i guess 
but  how did i get here 
well  let me show you  first 
i ll need a drop of blood 
your blood 
right 
that hurt 
relax  john  it s all
part of the miracle of cloning 
hello  john 
cloned from what 
loy extractions never recreated
an intact dna strand 
not without massive
sequence gaps 
paleo dna 
from what source 
where do you get 100
million year old dinosaur blood 
what  what 
well  mr  dna 
where did you come from 
from your blood 
just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of dna 
the building blocks of life 
a dna strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing 
and sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago  like dinosaurs 
left their blueprints behind for us to find 
we just had to know where to look 
a hundred million years ago  there
were mosquitoes just like today 
and just like today  they fed
on the blood of animals 
even dinosaurs  sometimes 
after biting a dinosaur 
mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap 
after a long time  the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized 
just like a dinosaur bone 
preserving the mosquito inside 
this fossilised tree sap 
which we call amber 
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside
until jurassic park
scientists came along 
using sophisticated
techniques 
they extract
the preserved blood
from the mosquito 
and bingo  dino dna 
a full dna strand contains
three billion genetic codes 
if we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day 
it d take two years to look
at the entire dna strand 
it s that long  since it s
so old  it s full of holes 
now that s where our
geneticists take over 
thinking machine super computers
and gene sequencers
break down the strand
in minutes 
and virtual reality displays
show our geneticists the gaps
in the dna sequence 
we used the complete
dna of a frog
to fill in the holes
and complete the code 
whew  and now 
we can make a baby dinosaur 
this score
is only temporary 
it all has very dramatic
music  of course 
a march or something 
it hasn t been written yet 
and then  the tour moves on 
well  look here  those
hard working cowpokes you see behind us   
this is overwhelming  john 
are these characters
autoerotica 
no  we have no
animatronics here 
those people are the real miracle
workers of jurassic park 
   in unfertilized emu
or ostrich eggs 
wait a minute  how do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis 
can t we see
the unfertilized eggs 
shortly 
now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on   
can t you stop
these things 
i m sorry 
it s kind of a ride 
one  two  three 
  you can t do that 
  what 
can they do that 
the boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 1900 
all personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845  no exceptions 
good day  henry 
good day  sir 
it s turning the eggs 
perfect timing  i d hoped they d hatch
before i had to go to the boat 
henry  why
didn t you tell me 
i insist on being here
when they re born 
come on 
come on  little one 
come on  then 
very good  push 
  very good 
  god 
push  come on 
come on  come on  then 
there you are 
they imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with 
that s it 
helps them to trust me 
i ve been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island 
surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild 
actually they can t
breed in the wild 
population control is one
of our security precautions 
there s no unauthorized
breeding in jurassic park 
how do you know
they can t breed 
because all the animals
in jurassic park are female 
we ve engineered them
that way 
there you are 
oh  my god 
look at that 
blood temperature seems
like about high 80s  maybe 
wu 
ninety one 
homoeothermic 
it holds that temperature 
yes 
but  again  how do you know
they re all female 
what  does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs  skirts 
we control their chromosomes 
it s really not that difficult 
all vertebrate embryos are
inherently female  anyway 
they just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage
to make them male 
we simply deny them that 
deny them that 
john  the kind of control you re
attempting is not possible 
if there s one thing the history
of evolution has taught us 
it s that life will
not be contained 
life breaks free 
expands to new territories
and it crashes through barriers 
painfully  maybe even dangerously 
but there it is 
there it is 
you re implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed 
no  i m simply saying
that life finds a way 
what species is this 
it s a velociraptor 
you bred raptors 
dr  grant 
as i was saying  we laid on lunch for
you before you go into the park 
our gourmet chef  alejandro   
what are they doing 
feeding them 
alejandro s prepared a
delightful menu for us 
chilean sea bass  i believe 
shall we 
they should all be destroyed 
robert muldoon 
my game warden from kenya 
bit of an alarmist  but knows
more about raptors than anyone 
what s their growth rate 
they re lethal at eight
months  and i do mean lethal 
i ve hunted most things that can
hunt you  but the way these move   
fast for a biped 
cheetah speed 
fifty  sixty miles per hour if
they ever got out in the open 
and they re
astonishing jumpers 
yes  that s why we re taking
extreme precautions 
do they show intelligence 
was their brain cavity   
they show extreme
intelligence 
even problem solving
intelligence 
especially the big one 
we bred eight originally 
but when she came in 
she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others 
that one  when she looks at you  you
can see she s working things out 
that s why we have to
feed them like this 
she had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came 
the fences are electrified 
right 
that s right  but they never
attack the same place twice 
they were testing the fences for
weaknesses  systematically 
they remember 
yes  well  who s hungry 
more
adventurous guests  of course 
can opt for our
jungle river cruise
or for a close up look
at our majestic   
none of these attractions are
ready yet  but the park will open
with the basic tour you are about to take 
and then other rides will come on line
six or twelve months
after that 
absolutely spectacular
designs 
spared no expense 
and we can charge
anything we want 
 2 000 a day   10 000 a day 
and people will pay it 
and there s
the merchandise   
donald 
this park was not built to
cater only for the super rich 
everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals 
sure  they will  we ll have
a coupon day or something 
the lack of humility before nature
that s being displayed here staggers me 
thank you  but things are a little
different than you and i had feared 
i know 
they re a lot worse 
now  wait a second  we haven t
even seen the park yet   
donald  let him talk  there s no reason 
i want to hear every viewpoint 
don t you see the danger  john 
inherent in what you re doing here 
genetic power s the most awesome
force the planet s ever seen
but you wield it like a kid
that s found his dad s gun 
it s hardly appropriate
to start hurling   
if i may 
i ll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you re using here 
it didn t require
any discipline to attain it 
you read what others had done 
and you took the next step 
you didn t earn the
knowledge for yourselves
so you don t take
any responsibility for it 
you stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish
something as fast
as you could 
before you even knew what you had 
you patented it  and packaged it
and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box  now you re selling it 
you re going to sell it 
i don t think you re
giving us our due credit 
our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before 
but your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could 
they didn t stop to
think if they should 
condors  condors are
on the verge of extinction 
if i was to create a flock of
condors on this island 
you wouldn t have
anything to say 
hold on  this isn t some
species that was obliterated
by deforestation or
the building of a dam 
dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction 
i don t understand this luddite attitude 
especially from a scientist 
how can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act 
what s so great
about discovery 
it s a violent 
penetrative act 
that scars what it explores 
what you call discovery 
i call the rape of
the natural world 
the question is  how can you know
anything about an extinct eco system 
and therefore  how could you ever
assume that you can control it 
you have poisonous plants
in this building 
you picked them
because they look good 
but these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they re in
and they ll defend themselves 
violently  if necessary 
dr  grant  if there s
one person here
who could appreciate
what i am trying to do   
the world has just changed so radically
and we re all running to catch up 
i don t want to jump to any
conclusions  but dinosaurs and man 
two species separated by 65
million years of evolution
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together 
how can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect 
i don t believe it 
you re meant to come here and
defend me against these characters
and the only one i ve got on my
side is the blood sucking lawyer 
thank you 
they re here 
you four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park 
spend a little time
with our target audience 
grandpa 
kids 
wait  careful with me 
we missed you 
me  too 
we loved the presents 
they were great 
did you enjoy
the helicopter 
yeah  it went down
and we all went right up 
now  kids  come away 
not too close to the cars 
aren t they lovely 
aren t they glorious  though 
these will be your transports
for the afternoon 
no drivers 
no  no drivers 
they re electric 
they run on this track in the
middle of the roadway here 
totally non polluting  top of the line 
spared no expense 
it s an interactive cd rom 
you touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want 
lex  you re all right in there 
dr  sattler  come with me 
dr  grant  come in
the second car 
i m gonna ride
with dr  sattler 
i read your book 
that s great 
do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that s where they went 
a few species may have
evolved along those lines 
because they sure don t
look like birds to me 
i heard that there
was this meteor 
hit the earth someplace down in
mexico  and made this big crater 
listen   
tim 
tim  which car
were you planning on 
whichever one you are 
then i heard about this thing in omni
about this meteor making all this heat 
it made diamond dust and
that changed the weather 
they died because
of the weather 
my teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named bakker  he says   
she said i should ride with you
 cause it d be good for you 
the boat is now loading 
everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure 
national weather service
is tracking a tropical storm
about 75 miles west of us 
why didn t i build
in orlando 
i ll keep an eye on it  maybe it ll
swing south like the last one 
ray  start the tour program 
hold onto your butts 
and why did
they put the fiberglass thing 
i know 
you want to
join the future  right 
god help us when
the hands of engineers   
during your tour 
the appropriate
information will be
automatically selected
and displayed for you 
look 
touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon 
are we gonna hit that 
welcome to jurassic park 
what have they got
in there  king kong 
the voice you re now
hearing is richard kiley 
we spared no expense 
if you look to the right 
you ll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour  called dilophosaurus 
dilophosaurus 
shit 
one of the earliest
carnivores 
we now know dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous
spitting its venom at its prey 
causing blindness and paralysis 
allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure 
this makes dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition
to jurassic park 
alan 
where 
damn 
vehicle headlights are on
and not responding 
those shouldn t be running
off of car batteries 
item 151 on
today s glitch list 
we have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo
and the computers aren t
even on their feet yet 
dennis  our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers 
i am totally unappreciated
in my time 
you can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days 
you think that kind of
automation is easy  or cheap 
you know anybody who can
network eight machines
and de bug two million lines
of code on my salary 
if so  i want to see them 
sorry about your financial
problems  i really am 
but they are your problems 
you re absolutely right 
everything s my problem 
i will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you 
i really will not 
there s been hardly
any debate at all 
i don t blame people
for their mistakes 
but i do ask that
they pay for them 
thanks  dad 
the headlights 
i ll debug the tour program
when they get back  okay 
it ll eat a lot of
compute cycles 
we ll lose part
of the system 
there s a finite amount of memory 
you can t use it for everything 
are you gonna compile
for a half an hour   
quiet  all of you 
they re approaching
the tyrannosaur paddock 
god creates dinosaurs 
god destroys dinosaurs 
god creates man  man destroys god 
man creates dinosaurs 
dinosaurs eat man 
woman inherits the earth 
we ll try
to tempt the rex now 
keep watching the fence 
what s going to happen
to the goat 
he s going to eat the goat 
excellent 
what s the matter  kid 
you never had lamb chops 
i happen to be
a vegetarian 
t rex doesn t want to be fed 
he wants to hunt 
you can t just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct 
eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour  right 
hello  yes 
i really hate that man 
the tyrannosaur doesn t obey any
set patterns or park schedules 
the essence of chaos 
i m still not
clear on chaos 
it simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems 
the shorthand is
the butterfly effect 
a butterfly can flap
its wings in peking
and in central park you get
rain instead of sunshine 
was i going too fast 
i missed it 
i did a fly by 
give me that glass of water 
we ll conduct an experiment 
we should be still 
the car s bouncing 
that s okay 
it s just an example 
put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic 
a drop of water falls
on your hand 
which way will the drop roll off 
which finger 
thumb  i d say 
freeze your hand 
don t move 
i ll do the same thing  start
with the same place again 
which way  now 
let s say back
the same way 
it changed  why 
because tiny variations 
the orientation of the hairs
on your hands   
alan  look at this 
   the amount of blood distending your
vessels  imperfections in the skin   
 imperfections in the skin  
   just microscopic 
never repeat and vastly
affect the outcome 
that s what 
unpredictability 
there  look at this 
see  i m right again 
nobody could predict that dr  grant would
suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle 
and there s another example 
see  here i am now by
myself  talking to myself 
that s chaos theory 
stop the program 
i told you  how many times  we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors 
stopping park
vehicles and rebooting program 
we re on 
will notify for resume 
i ll switch it
over to teleprompter 
what about
the circuit integrities 
screen says faulty sensor 
i ll call security 
we re at full go
on that and it looks good 
like i said  there s this other
book by a guy named bakker
and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases 
where are we going 
he didn t say
they turned into birds 
anyone else think
we shouldn t be out here 
and his book was a lot fatter
than yours  like this 
really  yours was
fully illustrated 
you okay 
look at this 
wait  watch 
come on  watch this 
whoa 
everybody stay here 
wow 
okay 
of course 
don t be scared 
come on  it s okay 
muldoon tranquillized her
for me 
she s sick 
oh  my god 
hey  baby 
she was always my favorite
when i was a kid
and now i see she s the most
beautiful thing i ever saw 
it s okay 
microvesicles 
that s interesting 
thanks 
what are her symptoms 
imbalance  disorientation 
labored breathing 
it seems to happen
every six weeks or so 
six weeks 
these are dilated 
they are 
take a look 
i ll be damned 
that s pharmacological 
from local plant life 
is this west indian lilac 
yes  we know they re toxic 
but the animals don t eat them 
are you sure 
pretty sure 
there s only one way
to be positive 
i d have to see
the dinosaur s droppings 
dino droppings 
droppings 
yeah  i got that 
that storm center hasn t
dissipated or changed course 
we re gonna have to
cut the tour short 
we ll pick it up
again tomorrow 
are you sure we have to 
it s not worth
taking the chance 
sustained winds at 45 knots 
tell them when they get
back in the cars 
ladies and gentlemen  last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes 
drop what you re doing
and leave now 
damn 
that is one
big pile of shit 
you re right  there s no
trace of lilac berries 
that s so odd  though 
all right  she s suffering
from melia toxicity
every six weeks 
let s see  rats 
she s tenacious 
you have no idea 
you will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything 
doctors  if you please  i have
to insist that we get moving 
i d like to stay with dr  harding
and finish up with the trike 
sure  i m in
a gas powered jeep 
i ll drop her off at the
center before i make the boat 
great  then i ll catch
up with you later 
you sure 
yeah  i want to stay
with her a little longer 
okay  then 
there s nothing i can do  the captain
says we got to go  we got to go 
you ve got to
give me the time 
i did a test run  it took me 20 minutes 
i think i can push it to 18
but you ve got to give me
at least 15 minutes 
no promises 
visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage 
so much for our first tour  two
no shows and one sick triceratops 
it could ve been worse 
a lot worse 
anybody want a soda or something 
i m going up to the machine 
i thought maybe
i d get somebody something 
i ve had only sweets and i m
gonna get something salty 
i finished
debugging the phones 
i was going to  so i did 
so i debugged the phones 
and i thought maybe
i should tell you the system
will be compiling
for 18 to 20 minutes 
so some of the minor systems 
they might go on and off for a while 
but it s nothing to worry about 
do you got any kids 
me  hell  yeah 
three  i love kids 
anything at all can
and does happen 
same with wives 
for that matter 
you re married 
occasionally 
i m always on the lookout
for a future ex mrs  malcolm 
five  four  three 
two  one 
  that s odd 
  what 
door security systems
are shutting down 
nedry said a few systems
would go off line  didn t he 
by the way  dr  sattler 
she s not available 
is she 
why 
i m sorry  you two are   
yeah 
what d i touch 
you didn t touch anything 
we stopped 
what the hell 
what now 
fences are failing
all over the park 
find nedry  check
the vending machines 
just look at this
work station 
what a complete slob 
the raptor fences
aren t out  are they 
no  no  they re still on 
why the hell would he turn
the other ones off 
access main program 
access main security 
access main program grid 
you didn t say
the magic word 
please  god damn it 
i hate this hacker crap 
phone nedry s
people in cambridge 
phones are out  too 
where did the vehicles stop 
their radio s out  too 
gennaro said to stay put 
kids okay 
i didn t ask 
why wouldn t they be 
kids get scared 
what s scary 
it s just a little hiccup in the power 
i m not scared 
i didn t say
you were scared 
i know 
boo 
hey  where did
you find those 
in the box 
under my seat 
are they heavy 
yeah  then they re expensive 
put them back 
don t scare me 
cool  night vision 
did you feel that 
maybe it s the power
trying to come back on 
what is that 
where s the goat 
jesus 
he left us 
where does he think
he s going 
when you got to go 
you got to go 
dr  grant

lex  you re choking me 
grab the wire 
 keycheck space minus 0  keychecks
off  safety space minus 0  
he s turning the safety systems off 
doesn t want anybody to see 
look at this next entry  it s the kicker 
 white rabbit object  
it did it all 
with the keychecks off 
the computer didn t
file the keystrokes 
the way to find them is to check the
computer s lines of code one by one 
how many lines of
code are there 
about two million 
two million 
yeah 
robert  i wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep
and bring back
my grandchildren 
sure 
i m going with him 
john 
i can t get jurassic park back
online without dennis nedry 
should have been
there by now 
damn it

i ll pull down this thing here 
and pull it back up again

tim  go 
go  tim  go 
faster  tim 
tim  jump

we re back
in the car again 
at least
you re out of the tree 
where s the other car 
alan 
dr  grant 
i think this was gennaro 
i think this was  too 
i think it s ahead of us 
it could be anywhere 
with fences down  it can wander in
and out of any paddock it likes 
he s put
a tourniquet on  ian 
remind me to thank john
for a lovely weekend 
can we chance moving him 
please chance it 
ellie  come on 
it s the other car 
dr  grant 
they re not here 
anybody hear that 
it s an impact tremor 
is what it is 
i m fairly alarmed here 
come on  we ve got to get
out of here  now  right now 
let s go 
must go faster 
here it comes 
stand on it  fifth gear 
get off the stick 
bloody move 
look out 
think they ll have
that on the tour 
are you hearing this 
come on  tim 
hurry up 
let s get up this tree 
come on  tim  it s okay 
listen  try up here 
oh  man 
i hate trees 
they don t bother me 
yeah  well  you weren t
in the last one 
look at the brontosauruses 
i mean  brachiosaurus 
they re singing 
don t let the monsters
come over here 
they re not monsters  they re animals 
these are herbivores 
they only eat vegetables  for you 
i think they d make an exception 
i hate the other kind 
they just do what they do 
what s that 
what are you and ellie going to do now 
if you don t dig up bones anymore 
i don t know 
i guess we ll just
have to evolve  too 
what do you call
a blind dinosaur 
what do you call
a blind dinosaur 
 do you think he saurus  
what do you call
a blind dinosaur s dog 
you got me 
a  do you think
 he saurus rex  
alan 
yeah 
what if the dinosaurs come
back while we re all asleep 
i ll stay awake 
all night 
all night 
they were all melting 
malcolm s okay for now  i
gave him a shot of morphine 
they ll be fine 
who better to get the children through
jurassic park than a dinosaur expert 
you know  the first
attraction i ever built when
i came down from scotland
was a flea circus 
petticoat lane 
really quite wonderful 
i had a wee trapeze
and a
carousel
and a seesaw 
they all move motorized 
of course 
people said they saw the fleas 
 i can see the fleas 
 can t you see the fleas  
clown fleas  high wire fleas 
and fleas on parade 
with this place 
i wanted to show them something
that wasn t an illusion 
something that was real 
something that they could
see and touch 
an aim not
devoid of merit 
but you can t think through this
one  john  you have to feel it 
you re absolutely right 
hiring nedry was a mistake 
that s obvious 
we re over dependent on
automation  i can see that now 
next time 
everything s correctable 
creation is an act
of sheer will 
next time 
it ll be flawless 
it s still the flea circus 
it s all an illusion 
when we have control   
you ve never had control 
that s the illusion 
i was overwhelmed
by the power of this place 
i made a mistake  too 
i didn t have enough respect for
that power  and it s out now 
the only thing that matters
now are the people we love 
alan and lex and tim 
john  they re out there 
where people are dying 
it s good 
spared no expense 
go away 
it s okay 
it s a brachiosaurus 
it s a  veggie saurus   lex 
 veggie saurus  
veggie 
come on  come on  girl 
come on  baby 
go 
i m not letting go 
it looks like
it has a cold 
yeah  maybe 
can i touch it 
sure 
just think of it
as kind of a big cow 
i like cows 
come on  girl 
come on up here  girl 
god bless you 
yuck 
great 
now she ll never
try anything new 
she ll sit in her room  never
come out  play on her computer 
i m a hacker 
that s what i said 
you re a nerd 
i am not
a computer nerd 
i prefer to be
called a hacker 
god 
you know what this is 
it s a dinosaur egg 
the dinosaurs are breeding 
but my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls 
amphibian dna 
what s that 
well  on the tour 
the film said they used frog dna
to fill in the gene sequence gaps 
they mutated the dinosaur
genetic code
and blended it with
that of frogs 
some west african frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female
in a single sex environment 
malcolm was right 
look 
life found a way 
no  that s crazy 
you re out of your mind 
he s absolutely
out of his mind 
wait  what exactly
would this mean 
we re talking about
a calculated risk 
which is the only
option left to us 
we ll never find the command nedry used 
he s covered his tracks far too well 
i think it s obvious now
that he s not coming back 
so  shutting down
the entire system   
get somebody else 
i won t do it 
shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything he did 
now  as i understand it  all the
systems will then come back
on their original
start up mode  correct 
theoretically  yes  we ve never
shut down the entire system before 
it may not come back on 
would we get
the phones back 
yes  again  in theory 
what about
the lysine contingency 
we could put
that into effect 
what s that 
that s absolutely out
of the question 
the lysine contingency prevents
the spread of animals 
if they ever get
off the island 
wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism 
the animals can t manufacture
the amino acid  lysine 
unless they re supplied with lysine
by us  they slip into a coma and die 
people are dying 
will you please shut
down the system 
hold on to your butts 
it s okay 
look  see that 
it s on  it worked 
what do you mean it worked 
everything s off 
shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers 
turn them back on 
reboot a few systems 
telephones  security doors  half
dozen others  but it worked 
system s ready 
where are the breakers 
maintenance shed
at the end of the compound 
three minutes  i ll have the
power back on in the park 
just to be safe  i want everybody
in the emergency bunker
until mr  arnold returns  and the
whole system s running again 
i m tired 
i m dirty 
i m hot 
looking at the map  i d say the
visitor s center is just a mile
over that rise there 
just keep   
what is that 
tim  can you tell me
what they are 
they are
gallimimus 
are those meat eating 
 meat asauruses  
look at the wheeling 
uniform direction changes 
just like a flock of birds
evading a predator 
they re flocking this way 
i want to go now 
just look how it eats 
please 
i bet you ll never look at
birds the same way again 
yes 
go now 
okay  keep low
and follow me 
look how much blood 
god  something went wrong 
something s happened 
something s wrong 
this is just a delay 
that s all it is  all major
theme parks have delays 
when they opened disneyland
in 1956  nothing worked 
if the pirates of
the caribbean breaks down 
the pirates don t
eat tourists 
i can t wait any more 
somethings wrong 
i m gonna go get
the power back on 
you can t just stroll
down the road  you know 
don t be too hasty 
i mean  it s only been gone   
i m going with you 
okay 
sorry 
now  this isn t going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light 
but i think i can follow this
and then talk you through it 
right 
but it ought to be me 
really  going 
why 
i m a    and you re a   
look 
come on  let s go 
we can discuss sexism in survival
situations when i get back 
you just take me through this
step by step  i m on channel 2 
right 
the shutdown must ve
turned off all the fences 
damn it  even nedry knew better
than to mess with the raptor pen 
come on  this way 
i can see the shed
from here 
we can make it if we run 
no  we can t 
why not 
because we re being hunted 
in the bushes 
straight ahead 
it s all right 
like hell it is 
run  towards the shed 
i ve got her 
go  now 
mr  arnold 
john  i m in 
great 
ahead of you is a metal staircase 
go down it 
okay  going down 
after 20 or 30 feet you come
to a t junction  take a left 
have her follow
the main cable 
i know how to read
a schematic 
i guess that means
the power s off 
that s not funny 
that was great 
well  maybe we  we could   
damn it  dead end 
wait a minute 
there should have been a right
turn back there somewhere 
look above you 
there should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction 
follow that 
okay 
following the piping 
i bet i could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top 
what would you give me 
respect 
come on  guys 
it s not a race 
i see the box 
it says   high voltage  
yeah 
okay 
good  here we go 
over the top 
take your time 
good  come on 
find your footing 
you can t throw
the main switch by hand 
you ve got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge 
it s large  flat  and gray 
all right 
here i go  okay 
one  two  three  four 
okay  charged 
under the words  contact position  
there s a round green button
which says  push to close  
push to close 
push it 
the red buttons turn on
the individual park systems 
switch them on 
get down now 
you re gonna have to jump
