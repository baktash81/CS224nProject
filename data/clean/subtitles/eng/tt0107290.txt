stand back
bring it
forward come on
slow it down
pushing team move in there
move in
on your ready
i want tasers on full charge
steady
go on step back in
ready move it
and push
locked loading team
step away
move it
jophery raise the gate
block the opening
dont let her get out
somebody help him
work her back
shoot her
i heard that hammonds
not even here
he sends his apologies
theres a 20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker
and youre telling me
that hammond cant see me
he had to leave early his
daughters getting a divorce
i understand but we need to
deal with the situation now
the insurance company
you okay
the underwriters feel that the accidents
raised safety questions about the park
that makes the investors
very anxious
i had to promise to conduct a very
thorough onsite inspection
hammond hates inspections
they slow everything down
i need to or theyll
pull the funding
thatll slow him down
even more
watch your head
if two experts sign off
on the island
the insurance guys
will back off
ive already got ian malcolm
but they think hes too trendy
they want alan grant
grant
youll never get him
out of montana
why not
why not
because grants like me
hes a digger
dr grant dr sattler
were ready to try again
i hate computers
the feelings mutual
take a look
did it work
how long
does this take
should bring
an immediate return
you shoot the radar
into the ground
and the bone bounces
the image back
bounces it back
this new program
is incredible
a few more
years development
and we wont even
have to dig anymore
wheres the fun
in that
its a little distorted but i
dont think its the computer
postmortem contraction of the
posterior neck ligaments
velociraptor
yes good shape too
its five six feet high
im guessing nine feet long
look
whatd you do
he touched it
dr grants not
machinecompatible
hell theyve got it
in for me
and look at the halfmoon
shaped bones in the wrists
its no wonder these guys
learned how to fly
no seriously
maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
presentday birds than with reptiles
look at the pubic bone turned
backward just like a bird
look at the vertebrae full of air
sacs and hollows like a bird
and even the word raptor
means bird of prey
that doesnt
look very scary
more like a 6foot turkey
a turkey
imagine yourself in the
cretaceous period
here we go
youd get your first look at this
6foot turkey as you enter a clearing
he moves like a bird
lightly bobbing his head
you keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement
like trex and hell lose
you if you dont move
but no
not velociraptor
you stare at him and he
just stares right back
and thats when
the attack comes
not from the front
but from the side
from the other two raptors you
didnt even know were there
because velociraptors
a pack hunter
he uses coordinated
attack patterns
and he is out
in force today
and he slashes at you
with this
a 6inch retractable claw like
a razor on the middle toe
he doesnt bother to bite
your jugular like a lion no
he slashes at you
here or here
alan
or maybe across the belly
spilling your intestines
the point is you are alive
when they start to eat you
so you know try to
show a little respect
okay
alan if you wanted
to scare the kid
you couldve pulled
a gun on him
yeah i know kids
you want to have
one of those
i dont want that kid
but a breed of the child
could be intriguing
i mean whats so
wrong with kids
theyre noisy theyre
messy theyre expensive
cheap cheap
they smell
they dont smell
some smell
give me a break
babies smell
cover the site
cover up the dig
tell them to shut down
cut the machine
cover it all up
pull it over
just cut it will you
shut it down
what
what the hell do you think
youre doing in here
we were saving that
for today i guarantee it
who in gods name
do you think you are
john hammond
and im delighted to meet you
finally in person dr grant
so i can see that my 50000
a year has been well spent
whos the jerk
this is our paleobotanist
dr
sattler
ellie this
is mr hammond
im sorry about the dramatic
entrance dr sattler but
did i say jerk
were in a hurry
will you have a drink we wont
let it get warm sit down
let me have this
ill just get a glass or two i can do it
theres samples
all over here
i know my way
around the kitchen
now ill get right
to the point
i like you
both of you
i can tell instantly about people
its a gift
i own an island off the
coast of costa rica
ive leased it from the government
and during the last five years
ive been setting up
a biological preserve
really spectacular
spared no expense
make the one ive got down in
kenya look like a petting zoo
and theres no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds
and what are those
small versions of
adults honey
and not just kids
everyone
were going to open next year if
the lawyers dont kill me first
i dont care for
lawyers do you
i dont really know any
dont really know any
i do theres a particular pebble in
my shoe who represents my investors
says that they insist
on outside opinions
what kind of opinions
well your kind not to put
too fine a point on it
lets face it in your particular
fields youre the top minds
and if i could just
persuade you
to sign off on the park
give it your endorsement
maybe even pen a wee testimonial
i could get back on schedule
why would they care
what we think
what kind of park
is this
its right up your alley
why dont you come down just the
pair of you for the weekend
id love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well
ive got a jet
standing by at choteau
im sorry
this isnt possible
we just dug up
a new skeleton
i could compensate you
by fully funding your dig
this is a very unusual time
the timing is
for a further
three years
wheres the plane
okay
three years
cheers
dodgson
you shouldnt use my name
dodgson weve got
dodgson here
see nobody cares
nice hat
whatre you trying to look
like a secret agent
well
on delivery 50000 more
for each viable embryo
thats 15 million if you get
all 15 species off the island
ill get them all
remember viable embryos theyre
no use to us if they dont survive
how am i supposed
to transport them
the bottom screws open
thats great
oh my god
its cooled and
compartmentalized inside
you guys
thats great
customs can even check it
if they want to
let me see
go on
theres enough coolant
for 36 hours
no menthol
the embryos have to be back
here in san jos√© by then
thats up to your guy
on the boat
700 tomorrow night on the east dock
make sure he gets it right
how are you planning
to beat security
ive got
an 18minute window
eighteen minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research
dont get cheap on me
dodgson
that was
hammonds mistake
so you two
dig up dinosaurs
well
we try to
youll have to get
used to dr malcolm
he suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality
especially for
a mathematician
chaotician chaotician
actually
john doesnt subscribe
to chaos
particularly what it says
about his science project
ian youve never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns
because of the behavior
of the system in phase space
a load if i may say so of
fashionable number crunching
dont
dr sattler dr grant
youve heard of chaos theory
no
no nonlinear equations
strange attractors
i refuse to believe that you arent
familiar with the concept of attraction
i bring scientists
you bring a rock star
there it is
bad wind shears
we have to drop pretty fast
hold on this will
be thrilling
but you need that piece over
here and that piece
well have landed
by the time you get it right
great
the full 50 miles of perimeter
fence are in place
and the concrete moats and the
motionsensor tracking systems
donald dear boy relax
try and enjoy yourself
lets get this straight this
is not a weekend excursion
this is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island
your investors whom i
represent are deeply concerned
fortyeight hours from now if theyre
not convinced im not convinced
ill shut you down john
in 48 hours ill be
accepting your apologies
all right slow down
slow stop
this shouldnt be here
alan this species of
veriforman has been extinct
since the cretaceous period
i mean this thing
what
look at that
its a dinosaur
you did it crazy son
of a bitch you did it
we could tear up the rule book on
coldbloodedness it doesnt apply
theyre wrong this is
a warmblooded creature
this thing doesnt
live in a swamp
this things got
a 25 27foot neck
the brachiosaurus
thirty feet
were gonna make
a fortune with this place
how fast are they
well we clocked the trex
at 32 miles an hour
trex
you said youve
got a trex
say again
we have a trex
put your head
between your knees
dr grant
my dear dr sattler
welcome to jurassic park
theyre moving in herds
they do move in herds
how did you do this
ill show you
good day
the most advanced amusement
park in the entire world
incorporating all
the latest technologies
and im not talking just about rides
everybody has rides
no weve made living biological
attractions so astounding
that theyll capture the
imagination of the entire planet
so what are you thinking
that were out of a job
dont you mean extinct
why dont you all sit down
donald sit down
here he comes
well here i come
hello
say hello
hello
hello john
yes ive got lines
well fine i guess
but how did i get here
well let me show you first
ill need a drop of blood
your blood
right
that hurt
relax john its all
part of the miracle of cloning
hello john
cloned from what
loy extractions never recreated
an intact dna strand
not without massive
sequence gaps
paleodna
from what source
where do you get 100
millionyearold dinosaur blood
what what
well mr dna
where did you come from
from your blood
just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of dna
the building blocks of life
a dna strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing
and sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago like dinosaurs
left their blueprints behind for us to find
we just had to know where to look
a hundred million years ago there
were mosquitoes just like today
and just like today they fed
on the blood of animals
even dinosaurs sometimes
after biting a dinosaur
mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap
after a long time the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized
just like a dinosaur bone
preserving the mosquito inside
this fossilised tree sap
which we call amber
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside
until jurassic park
scientists came along
using sophisticated
techniques
they extract
the preserved blood
from the mosquito
and bingo dino dna
a full dna strand contains
three billion genetic codes
if we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day
itd take two years to look
at the entire dna strand
its that long since its
so old its full of holes
now thats where our
geneticists take over
thinking machine supercomputers
and gene sequencers
break down the strand
in minutes
and virtualreality displays
show our geneticists the gaps
in the dna sequence
we used the complete
dna of a frog
to fill in the holes
and complete the code
whew and now
we can make a baby dinosaur
this score
is only temporary
it all has very dramatic
music of course
a march or something
it hasnt been written yet
and then the tour moves on
well look here those
hardworking cowpokes you see behind us
this is overwhelming john
are these characters
autoerotica
no we have no
animatronics here
those people are the real miracle
workers of jurassic park
in unfertilized emu
or ostrich eggs
wait a minute how do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis
cant we see
the unfertilized eggs
shortly
now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on
cant you stop
these things
im sorry
its kind of a ride
one two three
you cant do that
what
can they do that
the boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 1900
all personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845 no exceptions
good day henry
good day sir
its turning the eggs
perfect timing id hoped theyd hatch
before i had to go to the boat
henry why
didnt you tell me
i insist on being here
when theyre born
come on
come on little one
come on then
very good push
very good
god
push come on
come on come on then
there you are
they imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with
thats it
helps them to trust me
ive been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island
surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild
actually they cant
breed in the wild
population control is one
of our security precautions
theres no unauthorized
breeding in jurassic park
how do you know
they cant breed
because all the animals
in jurassic park are female
weve engineered them
that way
there you are
oh my god
look at that
blood temperature seems
like about high 80s maybe
wu
ninetyone
homoeothermic
it holds that temperature
yes
but again how do you know
theyre all female
what does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs skirts
we control their chromosomes
its really not that difficult
all vertebrate embryos are
inherently female anyway
they just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage
to make them male
we simply deny them that
deny them that
john the kind of control youre
attempting is not possible
if theres one thing the history
of evolution has taught us
its that life will
not be contained
life breaks free
expands to new territories
and it crashes through barriers
painfully maybe even dangerously
but there it is
there it is
youre implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed
no im simply saying
that life finds a way
what species is this
its a velociraptor
you bred raptors
dr grant
as i was saying we laid on lunch for
you before you go into the park
our gourmet chef alejandro
what are they doing
feeding them
alejandros prepared a
delightful menu for us
chilean sea bass i believe
shall we
they should all be destroyed
robert muldoon
my game warden from kenya
bit of an alarmist but knows
more about raptors than anyone
whats their growth rate
theyre lethal at eight
months and i do mean lethal
ive hunted most things that can
hunt you but the way these move
fast for a biped
cheetah speed
fifty sixty miles per hour if
they ever got out in the open
and theyre
astonishing jumpers
yes thats why were taking
extreme precautions
do they show intelligence
was their brain cavity
they show extreme
intelligence
even problemsolving
intelligence
especially the big one
we bred eight originally
but when she came in
she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others
that one when she looks at you you
can see shes working things out
thats why we have to
feed them like this
she had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came
the fences are electrified
right
thats right but they never
attack the same place twice
they were testing the fences for
weaknesses systematically
they remember
yes well whos hungry
more
adventurous guests of course
can opt for our
jungle river cruise
or for a closeup look
at our majestic
none of these attractions are
ready yet but the park will open
with the basic tour you are about to take
and then other rides will come online
six or twelve months
after that
absolutely spectacular
designs
spared no expense
and we can charge
anything we want
2000 a day 10000 a day
and people will pay it
and theres
the merchandise
donald
this park was not built to
cater only for the super rich
everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals
sure they will well have
a coupon day or something
the lack of humility before nature
thats being displayed here staggers me
thank you but things are a little
different than you and i had feared
i know
theyre a lot worse
now wait a second we havent
even seen the park yet
donald let him talk theres no reason
i want to hear every viewpoint
dont you see the danger john
inherent in what youre doing here
genetic powers the most awesome
force the planets ever seen
but you wield it like a kid
thats found his dads gun
its hardly appropriate
to start hurling
if i may
ill tell you the problem with the
scientific power youre using here
it didnt require
any discipline to attain it
you read what others had done
and you took the next step
you didnt earn the
knowledge for yourselves
so you dont take
any responsibility for it
you stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish
something as fast
as you could
before you even knew what you had
you patented it and packaged it
and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box now youre selling it
youre going to sell it
i dont think youre
giving us our due credit
our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before
but your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could
they didnt stop to
think if they should
condors condors are
on the verge of extinction
if i was to create a flock of
condors on this island
you wouldnt have
anything to say
hold on this isnt some
species that was obliterated
by deforestation or
the building of a dam
dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction
i dont understand this luddite attitude
especially from a scientist
how can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act
whats so great
about discovery
its a violent
penetrative act
that scars what it explores
what you call discovery
i call the rape of
the natural world
the question is how can you know
anything about an extinct ecosystem
and therefore how could you ever
assume that you can control it
you have poisonous plants
in this building
you picked them
because they look good
but these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century theyre in
and theyll defend themselves
violently if necessary
dr grant if theres
one person here
who could appreciate
what i am trying to do
the world has just changed so radically
and were all running to catch up
i dont want to jump to any
conclusions but dinosaurs and man
two species separated by 65
million years of evolution
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together
how can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect
i dont believe it
youre meant to come here and
defend me against these characters
and the only one ive got on my
side is the bloodsucking lawyer
thank you
theyre here
you four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park
spend a little time
with our target audience
grandpa
kids
wait careful with me
we missed you
me too
we loved the presents
they were great
did you enjoy
the helicopter
yeah it went down
and we all went right up
now kids come away
not too close to the cars
arent they lovely
arent they glorious though
these will be your transports
for the afternoon
no drivers
no no drivers
theyre electric
they run on this track in the
middle of the roadway here
totally nonpolluting top of the line
spared no expense
its an interactive cdrom
you touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want
lex youre all right in there
dr sattler come with me
dr grant come in
the second car
im gonna ride
with dr sattler
i read your book
thats great
do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and thats where they went
a few species may have
evolved along those lines
because they sure dont
look like birds to me
i heard that there
was this meteor
hit the earth someplace down in
mexico and made this big crater
listen
tim
tim which car
were you planning on
whichever one you are
then i heard about this thing in omni
about this meteor making all this heat
it made diamond dust and
that changed the weather
they died because
of the weather
my teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named bakker he says
she said i should ride with you
cause itd be good for you
the boat is now loading
everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure
national weather service
is tracking a tropical storm
about 75 miles west of us
why didnt i build
in orlando
ill keep an eye on it maybe itll
swing south like the last one
ray start the tour program
hold onto your butts
and why did
they put the fiberglass thing
i know
you want to
join the future right
god help us when
the hands of engineers
during your tour
the appropriate
information will be
automatically selected
and displayed for you
look
touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon
are we gonna hit that
welcome to jurassic park
what have they got
in there king kong
the voice youre now
hearing is richard kiley
we spared no expense
if you look to the right
youll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour called dilophosaurus
dilophosaurus
shit
one of the earliest
carnivores
we now know dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous
spitting its venom at its prey
causing blindness and paralysis
allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure
this makes dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition
to jurassic park
alan
where
damn
vehicle headlights are on
and not responding
those shouldnt be running
off of car batteries
item 151 on
todays glitch list
we have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo
and the computers arent
even on their feet yet
dennis our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers
i am totally unappreciated
in my time
you can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days
you think that kind of
automation is easy or cheap
you know anybody who can
network eight machines
and debug two million lines
of code on my salary
if so i want to see them
sorry about your financial
problems i really am
but they are your problems
youre absolutely right
everythings my problem
i will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you
i really will not
theres been hardly
any debate at all
i dont blame people
for their mistakes
but i do ask that
they pay for them
thanks dad
the headlights
ill debug the tour program
when they get back okay
itll eat a lot of
compute cycles
well lose part
of the system
theres a finite amount of memory
you cant use it for everything
are you gonna compile
for a half an hour
quiet all of you
theyre approaching
the tyrannosaur paddock
god creates dinosaurs
god destroys dinosaurs
god creates man man destroys god
man creates dinosaurs
dinosaurs eat man
woman inherits the earth
well try
to tempt the rex now
keep watching the fence
whats going to happen
to the goat
hes going to eat the goat
excellent
whats the matter kid
you never had lamb chops
i happen to be
a vegetarian
trex doesnt want to be fed
he wants to hunt
you cant just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct
eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour right
hello yes
i really hate that man
the tyrannosaur doesnt obey any
set patterns or park schedules
the essence of chaos
im still not
clear on chaos
it simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems
the shorthand is
the butterfly effect
a butterfly can flap
its wings in peking
and in central park you get
rain instead of sunshine
was i going too fast
i missed it
i did a flyby
give me that glass of water
well conduct an experiment
we should be still
the cars bouncing
thats okay
its just an example
put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic
a drop of water falls
on your hand
which way will the drop roll off
which finger
thumb id say
freeze your hand
dont move
ill do the same thing start
with the same place again
which way now
lets say back
the same way
it changed why
because tiny variations
the orientation of the hairs
on your hands
alan look at this
the amount of blood distending your
vessels imperfections in the skin
imperfections in the skin
just microscopic
never repeat and vastly
affect the outcome
thats what
unpredictability
there look at this
see im right again
nobody could predict that dr grant would
suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle
and theres another example
see here i am now by
myself talking to myself
thats chaos theory
stop the program
i told you how many times we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors
stopping park
vehicles and rebooting program
were on
will notify for resume
ill switch it
over to teleprompter
what about
the circuit integrities
screen says faulty sensor
ill call security
were at full go
on that and it looks good
like i said theres this other
book by a guy named bakker
and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases
where are we going
he didnt say
they turned into birds
anyone else think
we shouldnt be out here
and his book was a lot fatter
than yours like this
really yours was
fully illustrated
you okay
look at this
wait watch
come on watch this
whoa
everybody stay here
wow
okay
of course
dont be scared
come on its okay
muldoon tranquillized her
for me
shes sick
oh my god
hey baby
she was always my favorite
when i was a kid
and now i see shes the most
beautiful thing i ever saw
its okay
microvesicles
thats interesting
thanks
what are her symptoms
imbalance disorientation
labored breathing
it seems to happen
every six weeks or so
six weeks
these are dilated
they are
take a look
ill be damned
thats pharmacological
from local plant life
is this west indian lilac
yes we know theyre toxic
but the animals dont eat them
are you sure
pretty sure
theres only one way
to be positive
id have to see
the dinosaurs droppings
dino droppings
droppings
yeah i got that
that storm center hasnt
dissipated or changed course
were gonna have to
cut the tour short
well pick it up
again tomorrow
are you sure we have to
its not worth
taking the chance
sustained winds at 45 knots
tell them when they get
back in the cars
ladies and gentlemen last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes
drop what youre doing
and leave now
damn
that is one
big pile of shit
youre right theres no
trace of lilac berries
thats so odd though
all right shes suffering
from melia toxicity
every six weeks
lets see rats
shes tenacious
you have no idea
you will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything
doctors if you please i have
to insist that we get moving
id like to stay with dr harding
and finish up with the trike
sure im in
a gaspowered jeep
ill drop her off at the
center before i make the boat
great then ill catch
up with you later
you sure
yeah i want to stay
with her a little longer
okay then
theres nothing i can do the captain
says we got to go we got to go
youve got to
give me the time
i did a test run it took me 20 minutes
i think i can push it to 18
but youve got to give me
at least 15 minutes
no promises
visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage
so much for our first tour two
noshows and one sick triceratops
it couldve been worse
a lot worse
anybody want a soda or something
im going up to the machine
i thought maybe
id get somebody something
ive had only sweets and im
gonna get something salty
i finished
debugging the phones
i was going to so i did
so i debugged the phones
and i thought maybe
i should tell you the system
will be compiling
for 18 to 20 minutes
so some of the minor systems
they might go on and off for a while
but its nothing to worry about
do you got any kids
me hell yeah
three i love kids
anything at all can
and does happen
same with wives
for that matter
youre married
occasionally
im always on the lookout
for a future exmrs malcolm
five four three
two one
thats odd
what
door security systems
are shutting down
nedry said a few systems
would go offline didnt he
by the way dr sattler
shes not available
is she
why
im sorry you two are
yeah
whatd i touch
you didnt touch anything
we stopped
what the hell
what now
fences are failing
all over the park
find nedry check
the vending machines
just look at this
work station
what a complete slob
the raptor fences
arent out are they
no no theyre still on
why the hell would he turn
the other ones off
access main program
access main security
access main program grid
you didnt say
the magic word
please god damn it
i hate this hacker crap
phone nedrys
people in cambridge
phones are out too
where did the vehicles stop
their radios out too
gennaro said to stay put
kids okay
i didnt ask
why wouldnt they be
kids get scared
whats scary
its just a little hiccup in the power
im not scared
i didnt say
you were scared
i know
boo

look at the brontosauruses
i mean brachiosaurus
theyre singing
dont let the monsters
come over here
theyre not monsters theyre animals
these are herbivores
they only eat vegetables for you
i think theyd make an exception
i hate the other kind
they just do what they do
whats that
what are you and ellie going to do now
if you dont dig up bones anymore
i dont know
i guess well just
have to evolve too
what do you call
a blind dinosaur
what do you call
a blind dinosaur
doyouthinkhesaurus
what do you call
a blind dinosaurs dog
you got me
a doyouthink
hesaurus rex
alan
yeah
what if the dinosaurs come
back while were all asleep
ill stay awake
all night
all night
they were all melting
malcolms okay for now i
gave him a shot of morphine
theyll be fine
who better to get the children through
jurassic park than a dinosaur expert
you know the first
attraction i ever built when
i came down from scotland
was a flea circus
petticoat lane
really quite wonderful
i had a wee trapeze
and a
carousel
and a seesaw
they all move motorized
of course
people said they saw the fleas
i can see the fleas
cant you see the fleas
clown fleas highwire fleas
and fleas on parade
with this place
i wanted to show them something
that wasnt an illusion
something that was real
something that they could
see and touch
an aim not
devoid of merit
but you cant think through this
one john you have to feel it
youre absolutely right
hiring nedry was a mistake
thats obvious
were overdependent on
automation i can see that now
next time
everythings correctable
creation is an act
of sheer will
next time
itll be flawless
its still the flea circus
its all an illusion
when we have control
youve never had control
thats the illusion
i was overwhelmed
by the power of this place
i made a mistake too
i didnt have enough respect for
that power and its out now
the only thing that matters
now are the people we love
alan and lex and tim
john theyre out there
where people are dying
its good
spared no expense
go away
its okay
its a brachiosaurus
its a veggiesaurus lex
veggiesaurus
veggie
come on come on girl
come on baby
go
im not letting go
it looks like
it has a cold
yeah maybe
can i touch it
sure
just think of it
as kind of a big cow
i like cows
come on girl
come on up here girl
god bless you
yuck
great
now shell never
try anything new
shell sit in her room never
come out play on her computer
im a hacker
thats what i said
youre a nerd
i am not
a computer nerd
i prefer to be
called a hacker
god
you know what this is
its a dinosaur egg
the dinosaurs are breeding
but my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls
amphibian dna
whats that
well on the tour
the film said they used frog dna
to fill in the genesequence gaps
they mutated the dinosaur
genetic code
and blended it with
that of frogs
some west african frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female
in a single sex environment
malcolm was right
look
life found a way
no thats crazy
youre out of your mind
hes absolutely
out of his mind
wait what exactly
would this mean
were talking about
a calculated risk
which is the only
option left to us
well never find the command nedry used
hes covered his tracks far too well
i think its obvious now
that hes not coming back
so shutting down
the entire system
get somebody else
i wont do it
shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything he did
now as i understand it all the
systems will then come back
on their original
startup mode correct
theoretically yes weve never
shut down the entire system before
it may not come back on
would we get
the phones back
yes again in theory
what about
the lysine contingency
we could put
that into effect
whats that
thats absolutely out
of the question
the lysine contingency prevents
the spread of animals
if they ever get
off the island
wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism
the animals cant manufacture
the amino acid lysine
unless theyre supplied with lysine
by us they slip into a coma and die
people are dying
will you please shut
down the system
hold on to your butts
its okay
look see that
its on it worked
what do you mean it worked
everythings off
shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers
turn them back on
reboot a few systems
telephones security doors half
dozen others but it worked
systems ready
where are the breakers
maintenance shed
at the end of the compound
three minutes ill have the
power back on in the park
just to be safe i want everybody
in the emergency bunker
until mr arnold returns and the
whole systems running again
im tired
im dirty
im hot
looking at the map id say the
visitors center is just a mile
over that rise there
just keep
what is that
tim can you tell me
what they are
they are
gallimimus
are those meateating
meatasauruses
look at the wheeling
uniform direction changes
just like a flock of birds
evading a predator
theyre flocking this way
i want to go now
just look how it eats
please
i bet youll never look at
birds the same way again
yes
go now
okay keep low
and follow me
look how much blood
god something went wrong
somethings happened
somethings wrong
this is just a delay
thats all it is all major
theme parks have delays
when they opened disneyland
in 1956 nothing worked
if the pirates of
the caribbean breaks down
the pirates dont
eat tourists
i cant wait any more
somethings wrong
im gonna go get
the power back on
you cant just stroll
down the road you know
dont be too hasty
i mean its only been gone
im going with you
okay
sorry
now this isnt going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light
but i think i can follow this
and then talk you through it
right
but it ought to be me
really going
why
im a and youre a
look
come on lets go
we can discuss sexism in survival
situations when i get back
you just take me through this
step by step im on channel 2
right
the shutdown mustve
turned off all the fences
damn it even nedry knew better
than to mess with the raptor pen
come on this way
i can see the shed
from here
we can make it if we run
no we cant
why not
because were being hunted
in the bushes
straight ahead
its all right
like hell it is
run towards the shed
ive got her
go now
mr arnold
john im in
great
ahead of you is a metal staircase
go down it
okay going down
after 20 or 30 feet you come
to a tjunction take a left
have her follow
the main cable
i know how to read
a schematic
i guess that means
the powers off
thats not funny
that was great
well maybe we we could
damn it dead end
wait a minute
there should have been a right
turn back there somewhere
look above you
there should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction
follow that
okay
following the piping
i bet i could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top
what would you give me
respect
come on guys
its not a race
i see the box
it says high voltage
yeah
okay
good here we go
over the top
take your time
good come on
find your footing
you cant throw
the main switch by hand
youve got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge
its large flat and gray
all right
here i go okay
one two three four
okay charged
under the words contact position
theres a round green button
which says push to close
push to close
