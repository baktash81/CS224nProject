miss harridene
were you in love with evan pettyman
you are trespassing

theres no explaining this
i was in the schoolyard
watching stewart pettyman
playing after school
myrtle dunnage came up to talk to him
i saw her strike stewart pettyman
on the head
with a brick
that file is police property
howd you get that
perhaps i subdued sergeant farrat
with a brick
or a feather boa
i heard a sickening crack
now surely if this had happened
id have some memory of it
i mean who could forget
that vivid sickening crack
i wouldnt do that if i were you
oh oh
whoa
oh help help
oh oh
i screamed stop murderer stop
but myrtle dunnage
just looked at me and laughed
oh really
i dont remember being
such a mirthful child
whereupon myrtle dunnage
continued to stamp brutally
again and again
upon the boys broken poor neck
oh beulah
two split infinitives
no wonder they called me illiterate
at my new school
hah
oh
oh are you are you
scared of me beulah
you werent when i was 10
you would hit me with a ruler
whenever i got a sum wrong
or spilled the ink
mmm
so why didnt you stop me
when i stamped again and again
on the broken poor neck
of stewart pettyman
hmm
i couldnt
i was 10 years old
i couldnt have done any of this
everyone knew it was you
you were the only one there
you were there
what are you insinuating
me
i wasnt there
i came around the corner
and saw poor stewart pettyman
lying on the ground
his head all twisted to one side
and you you standing over him
you lied
you didnt see any of it
he wouldve blamed me
who
evan
evan pettyman
it was my job to protect his son
but you you and your mad mother
youre evil
lord knows what youre capable of
try and hit her fat arse
oh
elsbeth

to do their costumes
thank heavens you have una
youre gonna make me something why not
you make frocks for them
why not your own mother
mother
thats right something smart
suitable for entertaining
and i want you to eat myrtle
i met your father when i was 20
i was very naive
you dont remember him
coming to the house
no
oh
well i wasnt naive enough to marry him
he didnt talk to you much
you werent a son you know
i thought hed just leave us in peace
marigold
her father was the shire president
and when he died
he left all his money to her
well evan just
swept her off her feet
poor marigold
he um
he had you sent away to hurt me
i came back
i came back
for me
cause you thought i needed you
but really it was you that needed me
oh youve put on a lovely spread molly
and youve decorated
cocktail snacks and cucumber
sandwiches cut real thin
its the dungatar social committee
do you remember the summer eisteddfod
dungatar is doing macbeth
and they want you to do
the costumes poor old una
no unas been cast as lady macbeth
she cant possibly be both
lead actress and seamstress
of course not cocktail snack
myrtle the town will never forget
but they might forgive
if you were to win us the eisteddfod
trudys the director
who
me oh everyone calls me trudy now
we have some ideas about what we want
thank you trudy
this is baroque
well it is shakespeare
you have heard of him
double double toil and trouble
fire burn and cauldron bubble
fillet of a fenny snake
in the cauldron boil and bake
oh plays are such fun
they bring out the best and the worst
in people dont you think
so its all settled then
no
hmm
she means itll cost you cash up front
or you will just have to wait
another year
id rather die than make one costume
for those vile idiots
how could you
how could you invite them up here
they left you to rot
but im still alive
they sent me away from you
but now youre back
stop it
stop it stop it
stop it
it nearly killed me
when they sent you away
but i ended up hoping
youd never come back
to this dreadful place
you were better off away from here
you would have been stuck
hiding with me on the top of this hill
if you hadnt been sent away
but instead you can create
you can transform people
thats very powerful
use it
use it against them
i have a plan myrtle
oh youre looking lovely molly
youre blind irma
no she does work magic my girl
but she needs money to get started again
thats why this letter
has got to get to winyerp
if i take it to the post office
the bastards wont send it
and go easy on them cakes irma
i made them a little bit stronger
than she would have
shes young you know
she doesnt understand pain like we do
goodbye old friend
oh
molly
molly
ooh
oh alvin
god she must have broken
something when she fell
can we give her anything for the pain
you cant do anything for a stroke
its gods will
but but shes in pain
shell be in a coma soon
and shell be dead by morning
you vile old man
its alright
mum oh god
mum mum its alright its alright mum

oh god
poor molly
alright ill change it
dont upset yourself till
she would have hated that one
she would have hated it
and now youre going to tell your missus
when you get home
who you were with last night
oh you dont like it ill take it off
all these songs
are corruptive and pornographic
no wonder poor molly got into trouble
its all the fault of
of persuasive popular song
and and a lecher
therell be no more
therell be no more singing
mollys dead theyre alive
and i have to suffer
now beulah
the conductor will make an announcement
when you reach melbourne
where a nurse will take you
to the sanatorium

beulah says she tripped
dumping rubbish at the tip
but prudence reckons shed been drinking
and gert i mean trudy says
drunkenness is a sin
and god has punished her
