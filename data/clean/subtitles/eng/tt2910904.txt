i lost my son 
you know 
stewart 
you might remember him from school 
he fell out of a tree and died 
do you remember that day 
  no 
  no one remembers stewart now 
but i remember 
that s why i find it difficult
to leave the house 
everywhere i go  i see what i once had 
where stewart once walked 
no one remembers stewart now 
not his friends 
not his own father 
not even beulah 
south paciﬁc 
could i 
please 
  most people     
i want to look better than everybody else 
especially elsbeth 
something like this 
maybe 
  lost in the middle of a foggy sea     
oh 
  most people     
if you re game  i am 
  long for another     
  mrs pettyman   
    island     
just then   
why did you say   not even beulah  
she was there when stewart died 
saw the whole thing 
  bali ha i     
  sergeant farrat 
  tilly 
marigold pettyman came to see me 
you need to show me
beulah harridene s witness statement 
well  that s not possible 
it s police property 
i couldn t    show it    to you

  don t sigh and gaze at me     
not invited to the wedding 
miss harridene 
were you in love with evan pettyman 
you are trespassing 
 cause otherwise 
there s no explaining this 
 i was in the schoolyard 
 watching stewart pettyman
playing after school 
 myrtle dunnage came up to talk to him 
 i saw her strike stewart pettyman
on the head
 with a brick  
that file is police property 
how d you get that  
perhaps i subdued sergeant farrat
with a brick 
or    a feather boa 
 i heard a sickening crack  
now  surely if this had happened 
i d have some memory of it 
i mean  who could forget
that vivid   sickening crack  
i wouldn t do that if i were you 
oh  oh 
whoa 
oh  help  help 
oh  oh 
 i screamed   stop  murderer  stop  
 but myrtle dunnage
just looked at me and laughed  
oh  really 
i don t remember being
such a mirthful child 
 whereupon myrtle dunnage
continued to stamp brutally 
 again and again 
 upon the boy s broken poor neck  
oh  beulah 
two split infinitives 
no wonder they called me illiterate
at my new school 
  hah 
  oh   
oh  are you    are you
scared of me  beulah 
you weren t when i was 10 
you would hit me with a ruler
whenever i got a sum wrong 
  or spilled the ink 
  mmm   
so why didn t you stop me
when i  stamped again and again 
on the  broken poor neck 
of stewart pettyman 
  hmm

i was 10 years old 
i couldn t have done any of this 
everyone knew it was you 
you were the only one there 
you were there 
what are you insinuating 
me  
i wasn t there 
i came around the corner
and saw poor stewart pettyman
lying on the ground 
his head all twisted to one side 
and you    you standing over him 
you lied 
you didn t see any of it 
he would ve blamed me 
  who

to do their costumes 
thank heavens you have una 
you re gonna make me something  why not 
you make frocks for them 
why not your own mother 
mother   
that s right  something smart 
suitable for entertaining 
and i want you to eat  myrtle 
i met your father when i was 20 
i was very naive 
you don t remember him
coming to the house 
  no 
  oh 
well  i wasn t naive enough to marry him 
he didn t talk to you much 
you weren t a son  you know 
i thought he d just leave us in peace 
marigold 
her father was the shire president 
and when he died 
he left all his money to her 
well  evan just   
swept her off her feet 
poor marigold 
he  um   
he had you sent away to hurt me 
i came back   
  i came back   
  for me 
 cause you thought i needed you 
but really  it was you that needed me 
oh  you ve put on a lovely spread  molly 
and you ve decorated 
cocktail snacks and cucumber
sandwiches cut real thin 
it s the dungatar social committee 
do you remember the summer eisteddfod 
dungatar is doing macbeth 
and they want you to do
the costumes  poor old una 
no  una s been cast as lady macbeth 
she can t possibly be both
lead actress and seamstress 
of course not  cocktail snack 
myrtle  the town will never forget 
but they might forgive
if you were to win us the eisteddfod 
  trudy s the director 
  who 
me  oh  everyone calls me trudy now 
we have some ideas about what we want 
thank you  trudy 
this is baroque 
well  it is shakespeare 
you have heard of him 
 double  double toil and trouble 
 fire burn  and cauldron bubble
 fillet of a fenny snake 
in the cauldron boil and bake  
oh  plays are such fun 
they bring out the best and the worst
in people  don t you think 
so it s    all settled  then 
no 
hmm 
she means it ll cost you  cash  up front 
or you will just have to wait
another year   
i d rather die than make one costume
for those vile idiots 
how could you   
how could you invite them up here  
  they left you to rot 
  but i m still alive 
they sent me away from you 
but now you re back 
stop it 
stop it  stop it 
stop it 
it nearly killed me
when they sent you away 
but i ended up hoping
you d never come back
to this dreadful place 
you were better off away from here 
you would have been stuck
hiding with me on the top of this hill
if you hadn t been sent away 
but instead  you can create 
you can    transform people 
that s very powerful 
use it 
use it against them 
i have a plan  myrtle 
oh  you re looking lovely  molly 
you re blind  irma 
no  she does work magic  my girl 
but she needs money to get started again 
that s why this letter
has got to get to winyerp 
if i take it to the post office 
the bastards won t send it 
and go easy on them cakes  irma 
i made them a little bit stronger
than she would have 
she s young  you know 
she doesn t understand pain like we do 
goodbye  old friend 
oh 
molly 
  molly 
  ooh 
oh  alvin 
god  she must have broken
something when she fell

mum  oh  god 
mum  mum  it s alright  it s alright  mum 
it s alright 
oh  god 
poor molly 
alright  i ll change it 
don t upset yourself  till 
she would have hated that one 
she would have hated it 
  and now you re going to tell your missus
  when you get home
  who you were with last night     
oh  you don t like it  i ll take it off 
all these    songs   
are corruptive and pornographic 
no wonder poor molly got into trouble 
it s all the fault of   
of persuasive popular song
and    and a lecher 
there ll be no more   
there ll be no more    singing 
molly s dead  they re alive 
and i have to suffer 
now  beulah   
the conductor will make an announcement
when you reach melbourne 
where a nurse will take you
to the sanatorium 
i mean    specialist 
beulah says she tripped
dumping rubbish at the tip 
but prudence reckons she d been drinking 
and gert    i mean trudy says   
drunkenness is a sin 
and god has punished her 
irma  the cushion
