have you ever heard of the
espresso yourself truck
nope
the coffee they make jeff
is like you cannot believe
you know when people just

its obsession worthy
ok
so i started
i started to follow the
truck on twitter
i thought you hated twitter

so a few weeks ago the truck
was parked right across the

yeah
how did the stripper get
in the maids room
i put her there
so i kept going back to the
espresso yourself truck and
every time i would go there i
kept running into mckenna
so we just started talking
anyway she was like between
apartments her car was
getting towed
she had nowhere to stay tonight
and you know all the
work that i do for the homeless
at the j and you
know i thought heres

right in front of me
so you invited her to
stay here in our
house with our child
just for like a two nights
like one night maybe
you wont even notice
shes here jeff
jeff whispering i dont wanna
meet her right now
i think we should just
shut up

so out she goes back on the
street robbed of her one
opportunity she had
to finally escape
from being a sex worker
