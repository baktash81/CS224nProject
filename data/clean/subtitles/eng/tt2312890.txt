my body is built for this

you mean the stripper 
ok  sure 
the stripper  is in the maid s room 
the stripper s in the maid s room 
yeah 
how did the stripper get
in the maid s room 
i put her there 
so  i kept going back to the
espresso yourself truck  and
every time i would go there  i
kept running into mckenna 
so we just started talking 
anyway  she was  like  between
apartments  her car was
getting towed 
she had nowhere to stay tonight 
and you know all the
work that i do for the homeless
at the j  and  you
know  i thought  here s   
ok  here s actual homelessness
right in front of me 
so you invited her to
stay here in our
house with our child 
just for like a    two nights 
like  one night maybe 
you won t even notice
she s here  jeff 
jeff   whispering  i don t wanna

it s jello  and then you just
add whatever you have 
you know  fruit 
nuts 
you put nuts in the jello

you can put nuts in there 
cherries 
uh   
nuts
