all foreigners are  ayip  
they re considered dirty 
so is homosexuality 
that s a big crime here 
but most of them do it
every chance they get 
there are about 1000 things
that are  ayip  
you can stab or shoot somebody
below the waist but not above 
because that s intent to kill 
so everybody runs around stabbing
everyone else in the ass 
that s what they call
 turkish revenge

are you all right 
the new american ambassador
is following your case 
he says there is progress 
you want a cigarette 
but there is another route
that is quite possible 
 coughs 
for a proper amount of money 
it is possible
to convince the ten officials
to lose track of your papers
before the high court in ankara
confirms the sentence
of a lower court in istanbul 
you would not exist 
and you could be in greece by
the time the turkish court
discover their stupid
clerical mistake 
but i have to act before the
official sentence is handed down 
and for that
i must pay certain officials
an address 
 sighs 
billy 
what s that 
 paper unfolding 
  the blueprints 
  to what 
to the prison  man 
there was this german architect
in the hospital 
he was helping the turks
build some shit around the place 
i laid some bread on him
and he let me copy them 
it s too bad
you didn t have a xerox machine 
there are two ways out of here 
one is over the roof 
but that s kind of risky 
maybe one person 
two at the most 
the other way  i ll need your help 
and that is under 
a tunnel 
  are you serious 
  this is not stalag 17 
that s where you re wrong 
the tunnel is already built 
there s a basement
where they used to keep weapons 
beneath that are the catacombs the
christians built to bury their dead 
we re sitting right on top of it here 
the kraut says that there s
a bunch of hollow shafts 
they re like dumbwaiters 
all along these walls 
one of them
is right next to our shower 
if we get in there 
we can get down into the catacombs 
with three of us working 
it shouldn t take too long 
must be around here someplace 
i swear i heard a couple of dead
christians singing down there 
  you stop shitting me  man  okay 
  how do we get into the shaft 
we knock three times and say
we re a friend of the deceased 
i m getting this together and
i don t need no gastro head along 
you understand me  huh 
  we go through the wall 
  we go through the wall 
 laughs 
 laughing 
go through the wall 
the kraut was right  i checked it out 
there s no reinforced steel
in those shower walls 
it s real soft
from underground seepage 
the water like weeps
through the cement 
twenty  thirty years 
you can almost push it over 
all we have to do   
all we have to do
is use your screwdriver
to scrape the mortar out 
we pull out three stones
and squeeze through   
shh  shh  shh 
 ball bounces 
people chattering 
squeeze through  put them back 
and get our ass down the shaft 
it s a two night operation 
maybe three 
what do we do in the catacombs 
the catacombs 
what do you want  a door 
there s miles of them down there 
like a sewer system 
you must be fucking crazy 
they ve got to come up
someplace in istanbul 
you ve had your ass stopped
just one too many times 
you won t find any catacombs 
you ll just finish up in section 13 
billy  the tunnel or the roof 
forget the wall 
rifki s always there 
and the roof  
the bullet percentage is too high 
but if we take the shaft 
i need you to help me
move those stones  man 
if we get caught 
i ll get the shaft 
now i m facing another 20 months 
i ll be back up to
three years again  maybe more 
fuck it  then 
you choose your own death 
i ll do this thing on my own 
i m taking the roof out of here

okay 
i ve been thinking
about another way 
  another way what 
  out of here 
oh  yeah 
when i was in the sanatorium 
there was only one guard
on my ward 
  i could have got out of there 
  why didn t you 
as soon as i could walk 
they threw me back in here 
  lucky you 
  i tell you  billy   
another ward in the sanatorium
had no guard on it at all 
  who was in it 
  three guys 
what was wrong with them 
i don t know 
  i think they were dead 
  it figures 
i ve got to go  it s daniels 
turkish justice has done it again 
they re going to let me off my last
53 days  jimmy  i m going home 
god   i ve got to go  
 speaking in turkish 
what s wrong 
sit down  billy 
i m afraid
i have some bad news for you 
  is it dad  mom 
  no 
  you re going to have a new court 
  what do you mean 
the prosecutor objected
to your sentence for possession 
he wanted a smuggling conviction 
the ankara court reviewed it 
it seems everyone wanted
an example made  a scapegoat 
and 
we ve been notified
that they rejected the sentence 
there were 35 judges in the court 
28 voted for a life sentence 
the lower court in istanbul
had to go along with the decision 
the judge likes you 
he notified your dad 
what do you mean  life 
  life for what 
  billy 
i have 53 days left 
i have 53 days left 
i have 53 days left 
you goddamn bastard 
i have 53 days   let me go 
billy 
so now it s time for me to speak 
what is there for me to say 
when i finish 
you ll sentence me for my crime 
so let me ask you now 
what is a crime 
what is a punishment 
it seems to vary from time to time
and place to place 
what s legal today
is suddenly illegal tomorrow
because some society
says it s so 
what s illegal is suddenly legal
because everybody s doing it 
you can t put everybody in jail 
i m not saying
this is right or wrong 
i m just saying
that s the way it is 
i ve spent three and a half years
of my life in your prison 
i think i ve paid for my error 
if it s your decision today
to sentence me to more years   
then i   
my lawyer   that s a good one 
he says   be cool  billy 
don t get angry  don t get upset 
be good  i ll get you a pardon 
an amnesty  an appeal 
a this  a that  the other thing  
this has been going on now
for three and a half years 
i ve been playing it cool 
i ve been good 
now i m damn tired of being good 
because you people gave me
the belief that i had 53 days left 
you hung 53 days in my face 
and then you took them away 
and you  boo 
i wish you could be standing
where i m standing right now 
then you would know something
that you don t know 
mercy 
you would know that the concept
of a society
is based on the quality
of that mercy 
its sense of fair play and justice 
but i guess that s like asking
a bear to shit in a toilet 
 breathing heavily 
 chuckles 
 chuckles 
for a nation of pigs 
it sure is funny you don t eat them 
jesus christ forgave the bastards 
but i can t 
i hate 
i hate you 
i hate your nation
and i hate your people 
i fuck your sons and daughters
because they re pigs 
you re a pig 
you re all pigs
