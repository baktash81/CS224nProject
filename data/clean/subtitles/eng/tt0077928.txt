man shouts in turkish
all foreigners are ayip
theyre considered dirty
so is homosexuality
thats a big crime here
but most of them do it
every chance they get
there are about 1000 things
that are ayip
you can stab or shoot somebody
below the waist but not above
because thats intent to kill
so everybody runs around stabbing
everyone else in the ass
thats what they call
turkish revenge
speaking in turkish
i know it must sound crazy to you
but this place is crazy

william
are you all right
the new american ambassador
is following your case
he says there is progress
you want a cigarette
but there is another route
that is quite possible
coughs
for a proper amount of money
it is possible
to convince the ten officials
to lose track of your papers
before the high court in ankara
confirms the sentence
of a lower court in istanbul
you would not exist
and you could be in greece by
the time the turkish court
discover their stupid
clerical mistake
but i have to act before the
official sentence is handed down
and for that
i must pay certain officials
an address
sighs
billy
whats that
paper unfolding
the blueprints
to what
to the prison man
there was this german architect
in the hospital
he was helping the turks
build some shit around the place
i laid some bread on him
and he let me copy them
its too bad
you didnt have a xerox machine
there are two ways out of here
one is over the roof
but thats kind of risky
maybe one person
two at the most
the other way ill need your help
and that is under
a tunnel
are you serious
this is not stalag 17
thats where youre wrong
the tunnel is already built
theres a basement
where they used to keep weapons
beneath that are the catacombs the
christians built to bury their dead
were sitting right on top of it here
the kraut says that theres
a bunch of hollow shafts
theyre like dumbwaiters
all along these walls
one of them
is right next to our shower
if we get in there
we can get down into the catacombs
with three of us working
it shouldnt take too long
must be around here someplace
i swear i heard a couple of dead
christians singing down there
you stop shitting me man okay
how do we get into the shaft
we knock three times and say
were a friend of the deceased
im getting this together and
i dont need no gastrohead along
you understand me huh
we go through the wall
we go through the wall
laughs
laughing
go through the wall
the kraut was right i checked it out
theres no reinforced steel
in those shower walls
its real soft
from underground seepage
the water like weeps
through the cement
twenty thirty years
you can almost push it over
all we have to do
all we have to do
is use your screwdriver
to scrape the mortar out
we pull out three stones
and squeeze through
shh shh shh
ball bounces
people chattering
squeeze through put them back
and get our ass down the shaft
its a twonight operation
maybe three
what do we do in the catacombs
the catacombs
what do you want a door
theres miles of them down there
like a sewer system
you must be fucking crazy
theyve got to come up
someplace in istanbul
youve had your ass stopped
just one too many times
you wont find any catacombs
youll just finish up in section 13
billy the tunnel or the roof
forget the wall
rifkis always there
and the roof
the bullet percentage is too high
but if we take the shaft
i need you to help me
move those stones man
if we get caught
ill get the shaft
now im facing another 20 months
ill be back up to
three years again maybe more
fuck it then
you choose your own death
ill do this thing on my own
im taking the roof out of here
jimmy screaming

dear susan
poor jimmy was caught
and beaten badly
he got a severe hernia
and lost a testicle
hes been in the sanatorium
for months
in comparison
my problems seem very small

okay
ive been thinking
about another way
another way what
out of here
oh yeah
when i was in the sanatorium
there was only one guard
on my ward
i could have got out of there
why didnt you
as soon as i could walk
they threw me back in here
lucky you
i tell you billy
another ward in the sanatorium
had no guard on it at all
who was in it
three guys
what was wrong with them
i dont know
i think they were dead
it figures
ive got to go its daniels
turkish justice has done it again
theyre going to let me off my last
53 days jimmy im going home
god ive got to go
speaking in turkish
whats wrong
sit down billy
im afraid
i have some bad news for you
is it dad mom
no
youre going to have a new court
what do you mean
the prosecutor objected
to your sentence for possession
he wanted a smuggling conviction
the ankara court reviewed it
it seems everyone wanted
an example made a scapegoat
and
weve been notified
that they rejected the sentence
there were 35 judges in the court
28 voted for a life sentence
the lower court in istanbul
had to go along with the decision
the judge likes you
he notified your dad
what do you mean life
life for what
billy
i have 53 days left
i have 53 days left
i have 53 days left
you goddamn bastard
i have 53 days let me go
billy
so now its time for me to speak
what is there for me to say
when i finish
youll sentence me for my crime
so let me ask you now
what is a crime
what is a punishment
it seems to vary from time to time
and place to place
whats legal today
is suddenly illegal tomorrow
because some society
says its so
whats illegal is suddenly legal
because everybodys doing it
you cant put everybody in jail
im not saying
this is right or wrong
im just saying
thats the way it is
ive spent three and a half years
of my life in your prison
i think ive paid for my error
if its your decision today
to sentence me to more years
then i
my lawyer thats a good one
he says be cool billy
dont get angry dont get upset
be good ill get you a pardon
an amnesty an appeal
a this a that the other thing
this has been going on now
for three and a half years
ive been playing it cool
ive been good
now im damn tired of being good
because you people gave me
the belief that i had 53 days left
you hung 53 days in my face
and then you took them away
and you boo
i wish you could be standing
where im standing right now
then you would know something
that you dont know
mercy
you would know that the concept
of a society
is based on the quality
of that mercy
its sense of fair play and justice
but i guess thats like asking
a bear to shit in a toilet
breathing heavily
chuckles
chuckles
for a nation of pigs
it sure is funny you dont eat them
jesus christ forgave the bastards
but i cant
i hate
i hate you
i hate your nation
and i hate your people
i fuck your sons and daughters
because theyre pigs
youre a pig
youre all pigs
