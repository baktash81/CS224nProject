bubba wilkes

walk out  walk out in these
dreadful swamps where  
where i could get eaten

any true regard for me whatsoever 
a tiger 
the first good grass
you come to  give  em a rest 
all right  john henry 
we ll be back around sundown 
hyah 
see d your dust all day 
what you drivin   buffalo 
stage arrived yet 
it s overdue  i ain t askin 
 cause i don t care 
but if your name s thomas  there s a couple
of popinjays waitin  inside to see you 
they ve been here
for two days now 
i give  em water the first day 
and they tooken root 
government agents 
i ain t asked  they ain t said 
are you the gentlemen
that were looking for me 
you are
monsieur john henry thomas 
you have me at a disadvantage 
i am monsieur pierre petain 
this is my companion 
señor luis escudero 
we have the honor to represent
the emperor maximilian of mexico 
oh 
won t you have a chair 
monsieur thomas 
well  thank you  no 
we re waiting for the stage  
we understand
you have many horses 
is that correct  mr  thomas 
it could be 
we have been authorized by the emperor
to purchase all you can supply 
well  i m afraid you gentlemen
have made a long trip for nothing 
my horses are going
to the united states army 
but  mr  thomas  we ll buy
the whole herd  sight unseen 
top dollar  if you
drive them to mexico 
all expenses paid 
stagecoach is comin  
i m sorry  gentlemen 
our army needs them 
pardon me 
whoa  pedro flats 
mr  thomas 
that s right 
my name is d j  giles  and this
is my associate  mr  ezra parker 
howdy  this is short grub 
we re out of the u s  army
purchasing office at fort clark 
and we understand you have
some horses to show us 
no  i have some horses
to sell you 
three thousand  to be exact  and it s
the best herd you ll find anywhere 
fine  shall we go inside 
thank you 
we ll cull your herd
tomorrow  mr  thomas 
as soon as our wranglers
arrive from brackettville 
i suppose that out of 3 000 head  we ought
to able to find 500 or so that we can use 
our usual procedure is this  
just rein up a minute  mr  giles 
you re goin  a little fast for me 
do you mind trottin  through that again 
not at all  i said
that out of 3 000 head 
we might be able to find
500 or so that we can use 
you know  animals
that meet our specifications 
well  i have 3 000 for sale 
not 500 
well  surely you don t
expect us to purchase   
just any old horse
for the united states army 
well  now there just ain t
 any old horse  in this whole herd 
you ll take  em all or none 
mr  thomas  i m sure
you re aware of the fact   
that  uh  times are hard 
maybe not as hard as you think 
the army s not that hungry
for horse flesh 
this country is going through
a period of reconstruction 
money is in short supply 
hmm 
who can you sell  em to
if not to us 
monsieur petain 
hold up a minute there 
just for the record  what are you payin  
twenty five dollars a head 
last month it was 35 
but this month it s  25 a head 
well  these gentlemen have offered
to take the whole barrel  sight unseen 
is that correct 
that s correct  mr  thomas 
and what s your top offer 
thirty five dollars a head  of course 
you just bought yourself a herd 
and you can tell maximilian   
he won t find better animals between
montezuma and the canadian border 
just a minute 
you re selling horses
to maximilian   
in preference to your
own country s army 
no  i m selling horses for  3 5
in preference to 25 
you two figured to make
 1 0 a head 
are you calling us thieves 
well  mr  parker  yes  that s
a pretty accurate description 
wait a minute 
i didn t do anything 
you should ve 
read that message again 
sergeant 
 eighteen rolling units
with men  women and children   
 passed through gladesville 
texas  1 0 20 p m  this date 
 suspected confederates 
probable destination  mexico 
detain  search and turn back  
what do you make of that 
it seems i ve heard that bird
before  sir  at missionary ridge 
and if i m not mistaken 
that s a gray bellied sapsucker 
the river  come on 
hyah  hyah  hyah 
get your weapons 
real sorry  miss ann 
we didn t plan things this way 
let  em go  sergeant 
mcclarty  gibbs 
turn  em loose  let  em go 
giddap  hyah 
sir  i don t mean to  
i know  sergeant 
but if i can t have the whole dog 
i don t want the tail 
yes  sir 
we ll probably cross  em
at the old monastery  eagle pass 
bon  well  if we do not
see each other again 
then we will rendezvous
on the plain at durango 
bon courage  monsieur 
thank you 
they are fine looking
animals  mr  thomas 
the emperor will be pleased 
i hope he is 
but whether he is
or whether he isn t 
you have the money there
when the horses arrive 
what s troubling you 
cavalry s comin  from fort clark 
damn government agents 
can they stop us 
not if we get across
that river  they can t 
let s take  em to mexico 
let s go 
well  what are you waitin  for 
stop  em 
stop  em 
we ll be mighty proud to stop  em 
mr  giles   all 1 2 of us  
just as soon as you tell us
how to go about it 
next 
mr  mccartney  when
are we gonna have some meat 
right now  if you want it 
belly cheater 
high bred  you know
what good food is  don t you 
you mangy old cat 
hey  mccartney 
mister mccartney 
there s somethin  crawlin 
in these beans 
well  you can speak to it 
but don t play with it   
or else the others ll want one
in their beans too 
hold that plate 
yes  sir  i can just feel
that money in my pocket right now 
what are you gonna do with it
when you get it 
well  i had to give that
a lot of good thought 
but i somehow ain t come to set
right down on the notion yet 
i know what i m gonna buy me  
some pack animals and traps 
whatever s left over 
i m gonna get drunk 
and if i ever sober up again 
i m headin  for the rockies 
well  that might be fine
for you  whitt 
but me bein  better bred 
i got higher ambitions 
like what 
like building a small library
under a big elm someplace 
me and high bred s gonna go to st  louis
and open up a little cathouse 
everything quiet out there 
would you believe it  john henry 
i had to wake two of the men 
let s hope it stays that way 
you ain t expectin  trouble 
are you  john henry 
trouble  well  let s see 
we got maximilian on one hand   
and juarez on the other
and bandits in between 
on top of that 
we re americans in mexico   
taking a cavy of horses
to a very unpopular government 
why should we expect trouble 
how come you didn t
tell us that aforehand 
how come you didn t ask me 
john henry  there s a box canyon
about four miles from here 
enough forage to fill  em 
no  sir  but there s enough to hold  em 
there s somethin  else 
i rode across two trails 
one was wagons and horses 
the second trail was many riders  
at least 40 and maybe 60 
the second trail ran
just down the side of the first 
well  if you were to tell me
that a year ago   
in virginia or tennessee 
i d suspect ambush 
it looked that way to me 
short grub 
yo 
there s forage and water about
four miles ahead in a box canyon 
move  em in there and
hold  em till we get back 
where are you going  john henry 
i don t believe it 
pick up that bucket 
well  howdy  sergeant newby 
save your  howdy 
for later  jamison 
right now let me see you
start currying that horse 
yes  sir 
just like old times  eh  newby 
just like old times 
colonel 
riders approachin 
two riders a comin  
margaret 
we have company 
good afternoon 
my name s thomas 
we re drivin  a herd
of horses south 
just over the hill 
i m colonel james langdon 
mr  thomas  what can i do for you 
well  it isn t
what you can do for us 
we came to warn you that you re
probably riding into a bandit ambush 
well  how do you
happen to know that 
well  blue boy here
is a full blooded cherokee 
when he suspects somethin  
you usually get it 
there s 40 to 60 riders
moving parallel to you 
just out of sight 
waitin  until we get
into those hills 
that d be my guess 
what did you say your name was 
john henry thomas 
don t i know you
from somewhere 
to my knowledge  colonel 
we ve never met before 
well  we appreciate
the warning  sir 
it s late  will you and your friend

best offer we ve had all day 
there s nothin 
like a full stomach   
for facin  the unknown future 
well  i hate to be
persistent  colonel 
but  uh  i think
the future is pretty certain 
i fully agree 
i think they ll give you a couple of days to
get up into the hills before they strike 
if this was my outfit  i d hold
right here and make them come to me 
that s good thinkin 
i ve never yet let the enemy choose
the sight of his own destruction 
i like to play in my yard 
what are these bandits after 
gold  horses    women 
we had an experience or two
with  em before the    war 
were you  perchance 
in the war  mr  thomas 
yes  captain  i was 
would it be brash and
presumptuous of me to ask   
which side you were on 
mr  thomas 
well  i favor to think that
i was on the right side  mrs  langdon 
i detect a shadow of animosity
towards my question 
could it be that you
were a yankee soldier 
what a question to ask a man 
yes  ma am 
i was a yankee soldier 
mr  thomas   
i m about to make my rounds
before i turn in tonight 
would you care to accompany me

a war that ended months ago in virginia 
because i m a stubborn man

aggravatin  man  mr  thomas 
sergeant
