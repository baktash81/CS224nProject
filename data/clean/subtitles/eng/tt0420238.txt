and always told the truth
no thats not him
thats a rat
and anyone who knows anything
knows theres a big difference
between a mouse and a rat
ohhh
first of all
rats hate the light
they spend their
lives in the darkness
theyre also terrified of people
which is why they slink
and cower all the time
ooh
and as far as telling
the truth is concerned
well thats impossible
because as everyone knows
a rat cant talk
tell me that thing again please
come on
just once i promise
tell me one more time
and i wont ask you ever again i swear
fine we are headed to dor
one of the most
magical places in the whole world
no thats not what you said before
you know every place
has something special
and in dor its the soup
land ho
ohhh
its down below i tell you
give it a heave
i can see it
ooh i can smell it i can smell it
oh i cant wait
to taste the soup
just stay close
we leave again at 600
you know we ought to think
about staying here just a little longer
dont even think about it
remember shanghai
yeah but this place is different
i mean this is special
on any given day
just one whiff from one of the soup shops
was almost like
having a full meal
but on one very
special day every year
the kingdom of dor
was magically transformed
in dor christmas was nothing
well they still celebrated it
but it was nothing
compared to soup day
watch it watch it
incoming potatoes
hurry hurry excuse us
every dorian young and old
would flock toward the castle
because they knew that
at that very moment
deep within the royal kitchens
a masterpiece was being created
potatoes coming up
lets go
dont forget the parsley
make sure its clean
everyone knew
chef andre was a genius
but they got reminded of it
on the first sunday of every spring
at exactly 1200 noon
he would unveil that
years royal creation
more onions
more onions
more onions
more onions
they would jam the town square
and as the aroma began to build
so did their anticipation
ohhh
ow
sorry
wow
thank you
its my pleasure to announce
this years royal creations
from the kitchens of chef andre
oh no no no no no
something is wrong
i need more time
but were late already

be a genius all by yourself
in fact sometimes
it takes a little help

i know its dark
but youll get used to it
who who are you
just a rat like you
come with me
when something hurts
this much there must be a reason
there must be someone to blame
from this moment on soup
the making of soup
the selling of soup or the eating of soup
is hereby outlawed
in the kingdom of dor
rats are to be
considered illegal as well
and are hereby deemed
unlawful creatures in the kingdom of dor
from this moment on
anyone harboring sheltering
or possessing a rat in any way
shall face the full wrath of the law
so think about this
what happens when you make something
illegal that is just a natural part of the world
you may as well
make flies illegal
or sweat or monday morning
but thats what the king did
out of a terrible sadness
sunlight left and
the world went gray
colors faded into each other and
dark clouds filled the sky
and for a long time
it wouldnt rain
the clouds just stayed
and stayed and stayed
i wish it would rain
you and the whole world madam
ow
oh sorry milady
well at least i can still feel that
louise do you think
theres a bit of light
somewhere in the world

once upon a time

and they dont even tell you
what time that is yet
its like you have to find that out
youre not supposed to read it despereaux
youre supposed to eat it
good ill come back in an hour
and no reading its a rule
once upon a time
there lived a fair princess
fairer than any in any other land
hmm fair
and as the story goes
she was locked up in a faraway castle
where she could see the world
but could never touch it
she longed for a prince
a brave knight who would
deliver her from all of this
someone with courage
and honor and decency
but in a cruel and
frightened world
men like this were scarce indeed
they lived in a special world
built on courage and
chivalry and honor
they pledged their
lives to each other
to fight for truth
to defend the weak
to seek justice and to always
how was the library
fine
spoil your appetite
no helped it actually
made me hungrier
good lad
hahah
did you see theyre putting up
a new front on the crumb shop
oh but i loved the old front
quite modern yes
did a book ever speak to you
almost like it was
written for you
despereaux loved it all
every bit of it
the truth the justice
the bravery
the swordfighting
he even loved things
you wouldnt suspect
the story said she was a prisoner
but that wasnt totally true
because she had hope
and whenever you have hope
youre never really
anybodys prisoner
someday my prince will come
but how did she know that
yeah how did she know that
why are you crying
why are you crying
down here
are you a rat
no
what are you a mouse
i am a gentleman
and how do you do
youre sad
yes
because you have longing
youre a strange little mouse
thank you
come on
where did you hear that
about the longing
in a story
a story about what
about a princess like you
in a castle like this
oh youre a smooth little mouse
arent you
bet you tell that to all the princesses
i am sworn to tell the truth
it is a code of honor
ah not just a gentleman
an honorable gentleman
well then how does this story end
with this princess
whos locked in a castle
i dont know
i havent finished it yet
id love to know
oh i wish it would rain
i wish there was soup again
i even wish there were rats
will you promise me that
will you promise to finish your story
and tell me how it ends
yes it will be my quest
your quest you are a very brave mouse
thank you my good gentleman
whoa
whoa
whoa
now there are
all kinds of princesses
some are born that way
some marry into it
and some are destined
to be princesses
only in their own minds
but at one time or another
every little girl
longs to be a princess
im gonna live right there
right up there near the tippytop
quit your daydreaming
and feed those swine
yes i know its gonna be all mine
no you deaf little urchin
i said feed those swine
miggery sow had been
shoveling slop
for as long as she could remember
her uncle ned had put a shovel in her
hand from the minute she could hold one
but it turned out all right
because she got on
quite nicely with the pigs
thats right
im gonna have a special room
just for my dresses
and another whole closet
just for my knickers
in fact miggery sow could
see her future so clearly
she could see the tiara the fancy dresses
the maidsinwaiting
and when things got
really bad around the farm
she could see the moment that she would
finally be delivered from all of this
not long now
i promise you that
20 for the big ones
15 for the sow and 12 for the girl
15 for the girl same as the sow
i told you i told you
id make it to the castle
whoa
so sometimes it doesnt take much
for your dreams to come true
you just have to be
able to see it that way
she was beautiful like an angel
you are crazy
and she smelled so amazing
like a garden
despereaux
you cant talk to a human
that is the worst thing you can do
no its the best thing i ever did
they will throw you in the dungeon
you will get eaten by rats
it would be worth it
they could tear at my flesh
oh this is bad
oh and when she held me
in her hand it was
it was so soft
like floating in a pillow
you know what im worried about you
thats the point furlough
theres nothing to be afraid of
quiet they will hear you
come on just try it
just for a second just try being brave
oh
and stop cowering
whats going on in here
whats all this talk
about princesses and bravery
furlough i want to see you
in my study right now
are you sure
thats what he said
a real human
a princess
we need to tell them
we need to tell the mouse council
but theyll
this is bad this is very bad
if they find out
if they find out that they didnt find out
oh then theyll find
out that it was me who
oh no
but they will send him to the dungeon
oh hell get eaten by rats
oh
no not if we beg
if we really beg
and show them that hes changed
that hes afraid
that hes afraid
and hes turned into a real mouse
despereaux
of course
destiny is a funny thing
we go out to meet it
and we dont always know that we are
for glory and honor
surround him
despereaux tilling
how long have you been
working on this book
hmm a week
a week youve hardly cracked it
well i was
i just wanted to see how it ends
refused training as a mouse
refused to respect the will
and guidance of elder mice
repeatedly engaged in bold
and unmeek behavior
triggered willfully
not less than 17 mousetraps
just shameful
had personal contact with
with
with a human being
isnt there something you can do
antoinette stop right now stop that
you have to trust them
they are the council
theyre the council because
because theyre the council
theyre the council
is there anything you wish to say
in your defense
well it was a very good story
and she was a very beautiful princess
despereaux tilling
our laws are here
to protect us and our way of life
and when one of our citizens
strays from that way of life
he becomes a threat to us all
its an easy question
are you a man or are you a mouse
and your actions have told us
that you have a great deal
of trouble being a mouse
it is the judgment of this court
that you should be banished
from these walls forever
you shall be remanded into the
custody of hovis the threadmaster
who will prepare you for your
descent into the dungeons of dor
from which no mouse
and no light has ever escaped
shh
my baby
quiet be quiet my dear
theres nothing to be done
come with me

how a friendship is born

everything he knew about loyalty
and honor and
chivalry and courage
he told him about the princess
and where her longing came from
that she missed the rain and
the soup and even the rats
even the rats
he told him about their
code of honor about his noble quest
about duty and loyalty
and there in the
darkness of the cellar
two knights pledged devotion to a
princess who was trapped inside a castle
trapped in a life full
of pain and longing

hmm
thank you my good gentleman
i am sorry
im the one who should be sorry
im so so sorry
youve no idea how sorry i am
thats all right
im so sorry
so you could call all of this
a big misunderstanding
if you wanted to
a king was hurt so he hurt a rat
and a rat was hurt
so he hurt a princess
and a princess was hurt
so she hurt a servant girl
without even meaning to do it
and that servant had been
hurting for so long
that almost nothing
could make her feel better
but was it a mistake
or was it just good luck
because the servant girl
went back to her farm
and the jailer finally
found his princess
and the king found something
stronger than grief
and the mice finally
got rid of their fear
and the people of dor
lived side by side with their rats
all except one
who went back to sea
and felt a cool
breeze each morning
and the sun in his
face every afternoon
and wed tell you that they all
