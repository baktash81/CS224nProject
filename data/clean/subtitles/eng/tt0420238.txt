and always told the truth 
no  that s not him 
that s a rat 
and anyone who knows anything 
knows there s a big difference
between a mouse and a rat 
ohhh 
first of all 
rats hate the light 
they spend their
lives in the darkness 
they re also terrified of people 
which is why they slink
and cower all the time 
ooh 
and as far as telling
the truth is concerned 
well  that s impossible
because  as everyone knows 
a rat can t talk 
tell me that thing again  please 
come on 
just once  i promise 
tell me one more time 
and i won t ask you ever again  i swear 
fine  we are headed to dor 
one of the most
magical places in the whole world 
no  that s not what you said before 
you know  every place
has something special 
and  in dor  it s the soup 
land ho 
ohhh 
it s down below  i tell you 
give it a heave 
i can see it 
ooh  i can smell it  i can smell it 
oh  i can t wait
to taste the soup 
just stay close 
we leave again at 6 00 
you know  we ought to think
about staying here just a little longer 
don t even think about it 
remember shanghai 
yeah  but this place is different 
i mean  this is special 
on any given day 
just one whiff from one of the soup shops
was almost like
having a full meal 
but on one very
special day every year 
the kingdom of dor
was magically transformed 
in dor  christmas was nothing 
well  they still celebrated it 
but it was nothing
compared to soup day 
watch it  watch it 
incoming potatoes 
hurry  hurry  excuse us 
every dorian  young and old 
would flock toward the castle
because they knew that 
at that very moment 
deep within the royal kitchens 
a masterpiece was being created 
potatoes coming up 
let s go 
don t forget the parsley 
make sure it s clean 
everyone knew
chef andre was a genius 
but they got reminded of it
on the first sunday of every spring 
at exactly 12 00 noon 
he would unveil that
year s royal creation 
more onions 
more onions 
more onions 
more onions 
they would jam the town square 
and  as the aroma began to build 
so did their anticipation 
  ohhh 
  ow 
sorry 
wow 
thank you 
it s my pleasure to announce
this year s royal creations
from the kitchens of chef andre 
oh  no  no  no  no  no 
something is wrong 
i need more time 
but we re late already 
this is not right 
everyone out

now  it s hard to
be a genius all by yourself 
in fact  sometimes 
it takes a little help 
you changed something 
you re crazy  i did not touch it 
  i can smell it 
  hmm 
  what s this 
  what 
  this 
  ow  garlic

but    but i    but

no  not there 
you don t need to be afraid 
i know it s dark 
but you ll get used to it 
who    who are you 
just a rat  like you 
come with me 
when something hurts
this much  there must be a reason 
there must be someone to blame 
 from this moment on  soup 
 the making of soup 
the selling of soup  or the eating of soup 
 is hereby outlawed
in the kingdom of dor 
 rats are to be
considered illegal as well
 and are hereby deemed
unlawful creatures in the kingdom of dor 
 from this moment on 
 anyone harboring  sheltering
or possessing a rat in any way 
 shall face the full wrath of the law  
so think about this 
what happens when you make something
illegal that is just a natural part of the world 
you may as well
make flies illegal 
or sweat  or monday morning 
but that s what the king did
out of a terrible sadness 
sunlight left and
the world went gray 
colors faded into each other and
dark clouds filled the sky 
and for a long time 
it wouldn t rain 
the clouds just stayed
and stayed and stayed 
i wish it would rain 
you and the whole world  madam 
ow 
oh  sorry  milady 
well  at least i can still feel that 
louise  do you think
there s a bit of light
somewhere in the world 
don t know  ma am 
i think there is 
you just need to know where to find it 
okay  remember
when we told you how 
once upon a time 
there was this brave little mouse 
well  if you know
anything about fairytales 
you know that a
hero doesn t appear
until the world really needs one 
oh  look out 
alms for the blind  alms for the blind 
excuse me  excuse me 
excuse me 
excuse me

oh

hmm   once upon a time  
that s great  isn t it 
 upon a time  
and they don t even tell you
what time that is yet 
it s like you have to find that out 
you re not supposed to read it  despereaux 
you re supposed to eat it 
good  i ll come back in an hour 
and no reading  it s a rule 
once upon a time 
there lived a fair princess 
fairer than any in any other land 
hmm  fair 
and  as the story goes 
she was locked up in a faraway castle 
where she could see the world
but could never touch it 
she longed for a prince 
a brave knight who would
deliver her from all of this 
someone with courage
and honor and decency 
but in a cruel and
frightened world 
men like this were scarce indeed 
they lived in a special world
built on courage and
chivalry and honor 
they pledged their
lives to each other 
to fight for truth 
to defend the weak 
to seek justice  and to always   
how was the library 
fine 
spoil your appetite 
no  helped it  actually 
made me hungrier 
good lad 
ha hah 
did you see they re putting up
a new front on the crumb shop 
oh  but i loved the old front 
  quite modern  yes 
did a book ever speak to you 
almost like it was
written for you 
despereaux loved it all 
every bit of it 
the truth  the justice 
the bravery 
the sword fighting 
he even loved things
you wouldn t suspect 
the story said she was a prisoner 
but that wasn t totally true
because she had hope 
and whenever you have hope 
you re never really
anybody s prisoner 
someday  my prince will come 
but how did she know that 
yeah  how did she know that 
why are you crying 
why are you crying 
down here 
are you a rat 
no 
what are you  a mouse 
i am a gentleman 
and how do you do 
you re sad 
yes 
because you have longing 
you re a strange little mouse 
thank you 
come on 
where did you hear that 
about the longing 
in a story 
a story  about what 
about a princess  like you 
in a castle  like this 
oh  you re a smooth little mouse 
aren t you 
bet you tell that to all the princesses 
i am sworn to tell the truth 
it is a code of honor 
ah  not just a gentleman 
an honorable gentleman 
well  then  how does this story end
with this princess
who s locked in a castle 
i don t know   
i haven t finished it yet 
i d love to know 
oh  i wish it would rain 
i wish there was soup again 
i even wish there were rats 
will you promise me that 
will you promise to finish your story
and tell me how it ends 
yes  it will be my quest 
your quest  you are a very brave mouse 
thank you  my good gentleman 
whoa 
whoa 
whoa 
now  there are
all kinds of princesses 
some are born that way 
some marry into it 
and some are destined
to be princesses
only in their own minds 
but at one time or another 
every little girl
longs to be a princess 
i m gonna live right there 
right up there  near the tippy top 
quit your daydreaming
and feed those swine 
yes  i know  it s gonna be all mine 
no  you deaf little urchin 
i said feed those swine 
miggery sow had been
shoveling slop
for as long as she could remember 
her uncle ned had put a shovel in her
hand from the minute she could hold one 
but it turned out all right
because she got on
quite nicely with the pigs 
that s right 
i m gonna have a special room
just for my dresses
and another whole closet
just for my knickers 
in fact  miggery sow could
see her future so clearly 
she could see the tiara  the fancy dresses 
the maids in waiting 
and when things got
really bad around the farm 
she could see the moment that she would
finally be delivered from all of this 
not long now 
i promise you that 
20 for the big ones 
15 for the sow  and 12 for the girl 
15 for the girl  same as the sow 
i told you  i told you
i d make it to the castle 
whoa 
so sometimes  it doesn t take much
for your dreams to come true 
you just have to be
able to see it that way 
she was beautiful  like an angel 
you are crazy 
and she smelled so amazing 
like a garden 
despereaux 
you can t talk to a human 
that is the worst thing you can do 
no  it s the best thing i ever did 
they will throw you in the dungeon 
you will get eaten by rats 
it would be worth it 
they could tear at my flesh 
oh  this is bad 
oh  and when she held me
in her hand  it was   
it was so soft 
like floating in a pillow 
you know what  i m worried about you 
that s the point  furlough 
there s nothing to be afraid of 
quiet  they will hear you 
come on  just try it 
just for a second  just try being brave 
  oh 
  and stop cowering 
what s going on in here 
what s all this talk
about princesses and bravery 
furlough  i want to see you
in my study  right now 
are you sure 
  that s what he said 
  a real human 
  a princess 
we need to tell them 
we need to tell the mouse council 
  but they ll   
  this is bad  this is very bad 
if they find out   
if they find out that they didn t find out   
oh  then they ll find
out that it was me who   
oh  no 
but they will send him to the dungeon 
  oh  he ll get eaten by rats 
  oh 
no  not if we beg 
if we really beg
and show them that he s changed 
that he s afraid 
that he s afraid 
and he s turned into a real mouse 
despereaux 
of course 
destiny is a funny thing 
we go out to meet it 
and we don t always know that we are 
for glory and honor 
surround him 
despereaux tilling 
how long have you been
working on this book 
hmm    a week 
a week  you ve hardly cracked it 
well  i was

refused to respect the will
and guidance of elder mice 
repeatedly engaged in bold
and un meek behavior 
triggered willfully

just shameful 
had personal contact with   
with

despereaux tilling 
our laws are here
to protect us and our way of life 
and when one of our citizens
strays from that way of life 
he becomes a threat to us all 
it s an easy question 
are you a man or are you a mouse 
and your actions have told us
that you have a great deal
of trouble being a mouse 
it is the judgment of this court
that you should be banished
from these walls forever 
you shall be remanded into the
custody of hovis  the threadmaster 
who will prepare you for your
descent into the dungeons of dor 
from which no mouse
and no light has ever escaped

chivalry and courage 
he told him about the princess 
and where her longing came from 
that she missed the rain and
the soup and even the rats 
even the rats 
he told him about their
code of honor  about his noble quest 
about duty and loyalty 
and there  in the
darkness of the cellar 
two knights pledged devotion to a
princess who was trapped inside a castle 
trapped in a life full
of pain and longing

thank you  my good gentleman 
i am sorry 
i m the one who should be sorry 
i m so  so sorry 
you ve no idea how sorry i am 
that s all right 
i m so sorry 
so  you could call all of this
a big misunderstanding
if you wanted to 
a king was hurt  so he hurt a rat 
and a rat was hurt 
so he hurt a princess 
and a princess was hurt 
so she hurt a servant girl 
without even meaning to do it 
and that servant had been
hurting for so long 
that almost nothing
could make her feel better 
but was it a mistake
or was it just good luck 
because the servant girl
went back to her farm 
and the jailer finally
found his princess 
and the king found something
stronger than grief 
and the mice finally
got rid of their fear 
and the people of dor
lived side by side with their rats 
all except one 
who went back to sea
and felt a cool
breeze each morning
and the sun in his
face every afternoon 
and we d tell you that they all
