ah  well 
 man   i leave you
not just a model factory   
 but something infinitely
more valuable 
the future of string   
itself  
 explosion  shouting 
 and thus it is
my dying wish   
that my two sons run
smuntz string together  
great  let s stick a  for sale  sign
on the lawn and see what we can get 
ernie  we re not supposed to sell it 
we re supposed to run it together 
either way  this godforsaken museum
piece is not worth a dime 
now is it  lars 
some things are more important
than money  ernie 
notice it s always the
financially challenged who say that 
uh  please  please 
 i also bequeath to you
my personal effects 
 including my ceramic egg 
 half box
of cuban cigars 
oh

  my my collection of spoons  
   clattering 
 ernie  my goodness

no household should be without 
the ceramic egg

  i want you to have it 
  fine  i ll take it 
if you find any real estate

 chuckles  your father acquired it
many years ago as payment of a debt 
he he never lived there 
but i i it s interesting 
it seems the previous owner was found
locked in a trunk in the attic 
wait a minute 
is it worth anything 
well  he was able to borrow
 50 000 against it to pay his workers 
really  so  what
is its value today 
 50 000 
great  a worthless house and
a broken down string factory 
oh  well  at least the day

 man  smuntz string
is a relic of history 
you don t make string by twining
two strands together anymore 
no  you make it simple 
singular  strong  with nylon 
bu but that s not string 
tha that s cord 
  exactly 
  twine is yesterday 
  single strand cord is today 
  zeppco international   
has been interested in your factory for
years  but your father refused to sell 
we are hopin 
you would be a little smarter 
zeppco is willin 
to buy you out   
and bring this museum
into the 21st century 
 course  we would keep you
on as a string consultant 
with a huge salary
and a hefty pension 
so    what
do you say 
 sighs 
  my sons   
   whispers  ernie 
  ernie 
  yeah  just a sec 
i want you

big conglomerates

brothers  family 
  promise 
  i promise  pop 
   lars s voice  i promise 
  so  you were sayin  
i ll have to pass 
what 
 a world without string
is chaos  
for once the smuntz name
was worth something 
  no  no  don t 
  oh 
you    you used
to love string 
that was before 
when i was dating   
the son of a wealthy
string magnate 
not now  when i am married
to the half owner   
of a worthless
deathtrap 
i thought you d be happy 
i stood up for myself today 
april  i ve got new ideas
for the factory 
you know 
i ve got big plans 
don t you see  lars 
that s all you ve ever had are plans 
but my life is passing me by 
and l    i need more 
there s no air in the middle class 
lars  i can t breathe here 
  please  april  don t go 
   sighs 
i m not going anywhere 
in a few brief moments  the joy
of the holidays was shattered   
and the world changed
for many people 
mayor mckrinkle died
this afternoon at 4 30 p m  
at our lady of sorrows hospital 
doctors here say
the official cause of death is   
heart failure due to
the mayor s recent culinary disaster 
and once the hottest restaurant
on the wharf  chez ernie   
has been condemned
and scheduled for demolition 
i i don t think i ordered
my cheese sandwich with capers 
  we go live to leslie reinhart
for an update 
  i m sorry 
if there is a villain
in this tragedy  it is ernie smuntz 
  once the whiz kid of the
local restaurant scene   
  ernie  you re on tv again 
what  oh 
you know what this is 
i ll tell ya 
  guilt by accusation 
  no capers 
no capers  but that s just
grilled cheese  what s the point 
why don t they eat
out of a trough 
which one of you palateless
sheep sent my sandwich back 
hi  ernie 
  lars 
   sighs 
 ernie 
when i m in the kitchen  i cook 
i can t control every
single thing that goes on in there 
 lars  you know  it really
isn t fair for everybody to blame you 
  you didn t do anything wrong 
  yes  but society always needs
someone to persecute 
a scapegoat  someone to demonize 
the same thing happened to galileo 
really 
that s unbelievable 
with a cockroach
and everything 
no  the point is  i put
everything i had into that restaurant 
it was my livelihood
and my home 
in one fatal bite 
it was all taken away from me 
if only we could sell
the factory 
uh    i d let you stay with me 
you know  but  uh 
april threw me out 
  oh  that s too bad 
  yeah  well  don t worry
about me  though  ernie

you have no home  you have
no wife  you have no money 
you have no discernible talents 
how can you ignore that 
   music  i ll be home for christmas  music 
  ernie  it s christmas 
instead of dwelling on
what we don t have  we should
be thankful for what we do have 
 music  if only in my dreams  music  music

 ernie

 thumps 
charles lyle larue 
charles lyle larue 
charles lyle larue 
i m actually standing
in the missing larue 
  it s bold yet subtle 
  classical yet nontraditional 
the missing larue 
the rumored design completed shortly
before his committal is a rumor no more 
before his committal 
 chuckles  well  i m just glad
he finished the place   
before they carted him off
to the laughing academy 
 guffaws 
so  what do you think a magnificent
edifice like this is worth 
properly restored 
of course 
well  his parma charnel
house went for six   
but that was ten years ago  and it
didn t have this exquisite molding 
i see  i can t get enough
of good molding 
  did you hear that   600 000 
   exhales  ernie 
alexander falko

  guilty as charged 
gentlemen  i m going
to make you an offer

be so crass as to allow you to do that 
but you are welcome

to bid on the missing larue

 crashing 
my kitchen

to make himself a sandwich 
 ernie 
pickles  arugula and capers

 vinny on machine  mr  smuntz 
this is vinny from zeppco calling 
we waited in the square
for over an hour  but you never showed 
we do not appreciate
being treated this way 
especially after your brother
already turned down our generous offer 
consider our proposal
withdrawn 
  betrayed by my own brother 
  betrayal 
don t talk to me about betrayal  you
should have told me about that offer 
  half that factory is mine 
  and half is mi   
and half is mine  including the half
that you tried to sell 
yes  and would have  if it hadn t been
for that stinkin  bus 
bus  you can t leave well enough
alone  can you  you ruin everything 
me  you    you blame me
for this

you blew a hole in the floor 
yeah  well  i distinctly remember
somebody yelling   shoot  shoot  
y yeah  well  you ve never
listened to me before 
  and you know why 
  why 
because i have no
respect for you 
spending your whole life
in that stupid factory 
it s tragic 
you think i didn t have other things
i wanted to do with my life 
you think i didn t have
ambitions of my own 
  come on  you loved string 
  i didn t love string 
you and pop were always
huddled together   
running some piece of something
through your fingers 
it didn t matter what i did 
i didn t even exist 
i made him my special rack
of lamb for his 70th birthday   
   sighing  oh  no 
  yes  you remember 
i slaved over that meal 
making sure everything was perfect 
did he say   thanks  ernie 
it was delicious   no 
he only noticed the string
i had tied it with 
he was crazy 
but i still wanted
his approval 
i didn t leave  lars 
i was cast out 
there you go again 
blaming everything else
but yourself 
you think you re
a success  huh

here it is 
oh  yeah  give it
to me  then  go ahead 
 ernie laughing

we could have saved ourselves   
if we just threw fruit at him
in the first place 
 lars  oh  look 
h he s still breathing 
well  kill him  kill him 
find a blunt object 
  there you go  get the
