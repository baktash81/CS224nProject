where we lay our scene 
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny 
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean 
from forth the fatal loins
of these two foes   
a pair of star crossed lovers
take their life 
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows
do with their death   
bury their parents strife

our masters and us their men

a troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad 
where  underneath
the grove of sycamore
so early walking
did i see your son 
towards him i made 
but he was ware of me 
and stole into
the cover of the wood 
many a morning hath
he there been seen

the valiant paris
seeks you for his love 
a man  young lady

verona s summer hath

but no more deep

than your consent gives
strength to make it fly 
juliet  the county stays 
madam  i come 
go  girl  seek happy nights
for happy days 
 music playing 
 singing 
give me a case
to put my visage in 
a visor for a visor 
what care i what curious eye
doth quote deformities 
here are the beetle brows
shall blush for me 
ahh 
what  shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse 
or shall we on
without apology 
the date is out
of such prolixity 
let them measure us
by what they will 
we ll measure them
a measure and be gone 
come  knock and enter 
and no sooner in 
but every man
betake him to his legs 
and we mean well in
going to this masque 
but  tis no wit to go 
why  may one ask 
i dreamt a dream tonight 
ho  and so did i 
well  what was yours 
that dreamers often lie 
in bed asleep while they
do dream things true 
oh  then i see queen mab
hath been with you 
queen mab 
she is   she is
the fairies  midwife 
 laughter 
and she comes in state
no bigger than
an agate stone
on the forefinger
of an alderman 
drawn with a team
of little atomies
athwart men s noses
as they lie asleep 
her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner s legs 
and the cover 
of the wings of grasshoppers 
the traces
of the smallest spider s web 
and the collars  mmm 
of the moonshine s watery beams 
her whip  crack 
is a cricket s bone 
the lash of film 
and in this state
she gallops night by night
through lovers  brains 
and then they dream of love 
o er ladies  lips 
who straight on kisses dream 
which oft the angry mab
with blisters plagues 
because their breaths
with  er 
sweetmeats tainted are 
snd sometime comes she
with a tithe pig s tail 
tickling the parson s nose
as he lies asleep 
and dreams he
of another benefice 
 all  amen 
 laughter 
sometimes she driveth
o er a soldier s neck 
and then dreams he
of cutting foreign throats 
of breaches 
ambuscadoes  spanish blades 
drums in his ear 
at which he starts and wakes 
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two   
and sleeps again 
this is that very mab
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night 
and bakes the elf locks
in foul sluttish hairs 
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes 
this is the hag 
when maids lie on their backs 
that presses them
and learns them first to bear
making them women
of good carriage 
this is she   
this is she that   
this   is she 
peace  mercutio  peace 
thou talk st of nothing 
thou talk st of nothing 
true 
true  i talk of dreams 
which are the children
of an idle brain   
begot of nothing
but vain fantasy 
which is as thin
of substance as the air 
and more inconstant
than the wind
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north 
and being angered
puffs away from thence 
turning his side
to the dew dropping south 
this wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves 
strike drum 
come  lusty gentlemen 
 music playing 
 singing 
romeo  we shall
arrive too late 
i fear too early   
for my mind misgives   
some consequence 
yet hanging in the stars 
shall bitterly begin
his fearful date
with this night s revels 
and expire the term
of a despised life
closed in my breast 
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death 
 bell tolling 
but he that hath
the steerage of my course   
direct my sail 
enter my poor house 
vido  vido  welcome 
oh  my lovely helena 
my lovely niece 
welcome all 
be merry  gentlemen 
be lively  ladies 
ahoy  ahoy 
welcome  gentlemen 
i have seen the day
that i have worn a visor
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady s ear 
such as would please 
 tis gone   tis gone 
you are welcome  gentlemen 
ladies  ho  ho 
 music playing 
she doth teach the torches
to burn bright 
it seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night
as a rich jewel
in an ethiop s ear  
beauty too rich for use 
for earth too dear 
so shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows 
as yonder lady
o er her fellow shows 
did my heart love till now 
forswear it sight 
for i ne er saw true beauty
till this night 
this by his voice
should be a montague 
uncle  this is
a montague  our foe 
a villain that is
hither come in spite 
to scorn at
our solemnity this night 
young romeo is it 
dares the slave come hither
covered in an antic face 
to fear and scorn
at our solemnity 
 a bears him like
a courtly gentleman 
and to say truth 
verona brags of him
to be a virtuous
and well managed youth 
i would not for the wealth
of all this town
here in my house
do him disparagement 
therefore have patience 
take no note of him 
the moureska 
the moureska 
 jingling 
 laughs 
 music plays 
why  uncle 
 tis a shame 
go to 
you are a saucy boy 
you ll make a mutiny
among my guests 
am i the master here 
or you 
i will not endure him 
you will not endure 
he shall be endured 
or i know what 
well said  my hearts 
you re a princox 
be quiet or   
ah 
for shame 
i ll make you quiet 
leonardo will sing 
leonardo  i pray thee  sing 
what is a youth 
impetuous fire
what is a maid 
ice and desire
the world wags on
a rose will bloom
it then will fade
so does a youth
so does the fairest maid
comes the time
when one sweet smile
has its season for a while
then love s in love with me
some may think only to marry
others will tease and tarry
mine is the very best parry
cupid he rules us all
caper the caper 
sing me the song
death will come soon
to hush us along
sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall
love is a pastime
that never will pall
sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall
cupid he rules us all
a rose will bloom
and then will fade
so does a youth
so does the fairest maid
if i profane
with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine 
the gentle sin is this 
my lips  two blushing pilgrims 
ready stand
to smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss 
oh 
good pilgrim  you do wrong
your hand too much
which mannerly devotion
shows in this 
for saints have hands
that pilgrims  hands do touch
and palm to palm is
holy palmers  kiss 
have not saints lips 
and holy palmers too 
ay  pilgrim  lips that
they must use in prayer 
oh   
o then  dear saint 
let lips do
what hands do   
they pray 
grant thou 
lest faith
turn to despair 
saints do not move 
though grants
for prayers  sake 
then move not   
while my prayer s
effect i take 
thus from my lips 
by thine 
my sin is purged 
then have my lips the sin
that they have took 
sin from my lips 
o trespass sweetly urged 
give me my sin again 
a rose will bloom
it then will fade
so does a youth
so does the fairest maid

your great enemy

  romeo 
  romeo 
he is wise 
and on my life hath
stolen him home to bed 
he leaped
this orchard wall 
call  good mercutio 
romeo 
 whistles 
romeo  passion  lover 
o hooo  madman 
o hooo  romeo 
he heareth not 
he stirreth not  he moveth not 
the ape is dead 
he jests at scars
that never felt a wound 
romeo  it s all right 
 dog barking 
but soft 
what light through
yonder window breaks 
 bell ringing 
it is my lady 
oh  it is my love 
oh   
o that she knew she were 
she speaks 
yet she says nothing 
what of that 
her eye discourses 
i will answer it 
i am too bold 
 tis not to me she speaks 
two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens 
having some business 
do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return 
see how she leans her cheek
upon her hand 
oh  that i were
a glove upon that hand 
that i might touch
that cheek 
ay me 
she speaks 
oh  speak again 
bright angel 
o romeo  romeo 
wherefore art thou  romeo 
deny thy father 
and refuse thy name 
or if thou wilt not 
be but sworn my love 
and i ll no longer
be a capulet 
shall i hear more 
or shall i speak at this 
 tis but thy name
that is my enemy 
thou art thyself 
though not a montague 
what is montague 
it is nor hand nor foot 
nor arm nor face
nor any other part
belonging to a man 
o be some other name 
what s in a name 
that which we call a rose
by any other name
would smell as sweet 
so romeo would 
were he not romeo called 
retain that dear perfection
which he owes
without that title 
romeo  doff thy name 
and for that name
which is no part of thee 
take all myself 
i ll take thee
at thy word 
call me but love 
and i ll be new baptized 
henceforth i never
will be romeo 
what man art thou 
that thus bescreened in night
so stumblest
on my counsel 
by a name i know not how to
tell thee who i am 
my name  dear saint 
is hateful to myself 
because it is
an enemy to thee 
had i it written 
i would tear the word 
my ears have not yet drunk
a hundred words
of that tongue s utterance 
yet i know the sound 
art thou not romeo 
and a montague 
neither  fair maid 
if either thee dislike 
how cam st thou hither 
tell me and wherefore 
the orchard walls are
high and hard to climb 
and the place death 
considering who thou art 
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here 
with love s light wings
did i o er perch
these walls 
for stony limits
cannot hold love out 
and what love can do 
that dares love attempt 
therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me 
sshhh 
if they do see thee 
they will murder thee 
i have night s cloak to
hide me from their eyes 
and but thou love me   
let them find me here
my life were better
ended by their hate 
than death prorogued 
wanting of thy love 
dost thou love me 
i know thou wilt say ay 
and i will take thy word 
yet if thou swearest 
thou mayst prove false 
at lovers  perjuries
they say jove laughs 
o gentle romeo 
if thou dost love 
pronounce it faithfully 
or if thou thinkest
i am too quickly won 
i ll frown and be perverse 
and say thee nay 
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world 
in truth  fair montague 
i am too fond   
and therefore thou mayst think
my haviour light 
no 
but trust me  gentleman 
i ll prove more true
than those that have
more cunning to be strange 
i should have been
more strange 
i must confess 
but that thou overheard st 
ere i was ware 
my true love s passion 
therefore pardon me 
and not impute this yielding
to light love 
which the dark night
hath so discovered 
lady  by yonder
blessed moon  i swear 
oh  swear not by the moon 
th inconstant moon 
that monthly changes
in her circled orb 
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable 
what shall i swear by 
do not swear at all 
or if thou wilt   
swear by thy gracious self 
which is the god
of my idolatry 
and i ll believe thee 
if my heart s dear love 
i swear   
oh  juliet 
sweet  good night 
this bud of love
by summer s ripening breath
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet 
good night  good night 
as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart
as that
within my breast 
o  wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied 
what satisfaction
canst thou have tonight 
th  exchange of thy love s
faithful vow for mine 
ahh 
i gave thee mine before
thou didst request it 
and yet i would it were
to give again 
wouldst thou
withdraw it 
for what purpose  love 
but to be frank
and give it thee again 
and yet i wish
but for the thing i have 
my bounty is
as boundless as the sea 
my love as deep 
the more i give to thee 
the more i have 
for both are infinite 
juliet

sweet montague  be true

and homely in thy drift 
riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift

my heart s dear love is set 
on the fair daughter
of rich capulet 
as mine on hers 
so hers is set on mine 
and all combined 
save what thou must combine
by holy marriage 
when and where 
and how we met

exchange of vow

but this i pray 
that thou consent
to marry us today

jesu maria 
what a deal of brine
hath washed thy sallow cheeks
for rosaline 
and art thou changed

sentence then 
women may fall when
there s no strength in men

for loving rosaline 
doting  not for loving

another out to have

in a fool s paradise  
nurse 
shh  as they say 
it were a very gross
kind of behavior  
for the gentlewoman

should deal double with her 
it were an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman

weak dealing 
nurse  commend me

nurse  commend me

a thousand times 
ooh  ooh 
 sighs 
the clock struck nine
when i did send the nurse 
in half an hour
she promised to return   
perchance
she cannot meet him 
ahh  that s not so 
oh  she s lame 
love s heralds
should be thoughts 
had she affections
and warm youthful blood 
she would be
as swift in motion
as a ball 
but old folks 
many feign as they were dead 
unwieldy  slow  heavy   
and pale as lead 
o god  she comes 
o honey nurse

and kind 
and handsome

i ll to dinner 
honest nurse  farewell 
ha ha ha 
so smile the heavens
upon this holy act 
that after hours with sorrow
chide us not 
amen  amen 
come what sorrow can 
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy
that one short minute
gives me in her sight 
these violent delights
have violent ends 
and in
their triumph die 
like fire and powder 
which as
they kiss consume 
the sweetest honey
is loathsome
in its own   
deliciousness 
deliciousness 
and in the taste
confounds the   
appetite 
appetite 
therefore
love moderately   
long love doth so 
ah  here comes
the lady 
o  so light a foot will ne er
wear out the everlasting flint 
juliet 
good even to
my ghostly confessor 
romeo shall thank thee 
daughter  for us both 
ah  juliet 
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine 
that thy skill be
more to blazon it 
then sweeten
with thy breath
this neighbor air 
they are but beggars
that can count their worth 
but my true love is
grown to such excess 
i cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth 
tsk tsk tsk 
come  come with me   
we will make short work
