 woman  i ve got a hard cider

it s a party 
i m    i m just so 
so thrilled for you  kate 
to comet dibiasky  right  cheers 
it s gotta be  look 
it s gotta be an oort cloud comet
just based on where you saw it 
probably the last time
it was this close to the sun
was long before human civilization 
look at the arc on that thing 
god  it s amazing 
how would we find out the comet s
velocity in orbit  professor mindy 
that is a good question   sighs 
this will be fun  i haven t done
orbital dynamics since grad school 
question is  what 
what would carl sagan do 
he would take it back to first principles 
the topocentric vector is rho 
kate  what are the initial coordinates 
 kate  twenty one 
twenty four 
thirteen 
 mindy  this is fun  huh  guys 
  sixty seven 
  wow  now you got me pumped 
   man 1  dr  mindy 
  all right 
how many terms do you have to calibrate 
 mindy  approximation
of coordinates in marsden   85 
now that we have the comet s orbit 
we will check the ephemeris
and that will give us the distance
between the comet and planet earth 
why does the ephemeris
keep getting lower and lower 
 breathes deeply 
professor mindy 
professor mindy 
you know what  guys  let s 
let s call it a night  huh 
 man 2  but what about
the relative position 
i can t figure this one out 
not tonight  guys  sorry 
   man 1  let s hit it  man  i m beat 
   woman 2  me too 
   man 1  kate  this was amazing 
   man 2  congratulations

and his grad students   
this is dr  calder 
you pulled me out of a meeting
where i had to tell my team
we lost eight billion in funding 
i am so sorry  dr  calder 
but we are seeing some
awfully strange orbital numbers
on this comet we just found 
they should be in your inbox  right 
   calder  is this it 
  yeah  this is it 
oh  yeah  yeah  let me get
dr  oglethorpe on the line 
please hold 
uh  uh  i m on hold

i m gonna put them on speaker 
 music playing on speaker 
 dr  oglethorpe

defense coordination office  
  is that a real place 
  i have no idea 
 music continues playing 
 man on speaker  this is dr  oglethorpe 
yes  this is jocelyn calder
from kennedy space center 
 oglethorpe  hey  jocelyn 
listen  we got a sighting
of an neo from subaru telescope 
okay  uh 
why you just didn t report it
to the minor planet center 
 calder  it s a professor
and a bunch of michigan state students
who identified something big 
really  how large 
 calder  how big we talking 
we clocked it in around
five to ten kilometers wide 
about five to ten kilometers wide 
uh  that s a big boy 
and  uh  was this professor the one
who first made the observations 
hi  yes  uh  dr  mindy 
and    and no 
phd candidate kate dibiasky found it 
i did the orbital calculations 
i  uh  i study trace gasses
in dead galaxies 
i haven t published in a while
so you probably haven t heard of me 
but anyway  that doesn t matter 
sorry  what was your question 
what are the most updated estimates
on its trajectory 
 mindy  kate 
um 
i ve been running it all day 
i keep getting the same result 
a direct hit of earth
in six months and 14 days 
me too 
 calder  matthew 
what are your calculations 
um  scout program
is saying six months  14 days 
 calder  we got six months and 14 days 
and it s roughly five
to ten kilometers wide 
which  which  uh 
 mindy  isn t that 
an extinction level event 
well  let s not be dramatic here 
okay  uh 
first move is to get
the school field trip out here to dc 
 calder  let s all calm down 
i need the person who first had eyes
on the comet
and the person in charge 
what 
 indistinct chatter 
 share this data immediately
with cambridge  caltech and iau 
wait a minute 
this is classified information 
 mindy  what s happening 
 calder  i serve
at the discretion of the president 
is this really happening 
 and the dead galaxy professor
to hickam air force base 
 mindy  dc  right 
hey  hey  kate   clapping 
this isn t happening  right 
kate  this isn t real  right  this is  uh 
this is just some sort
of alternate reality  right 
say something

for over seven hours 
but they never called us in 
i couldn t believe it 
of course they didn t call you in 
kate  have you watched any news today 
no  i ve been pretty wrapped up
in our  project 
turn on your tv right now 
president orlean is in
the middle of an all time shit storm 
 reporter  sheriff wade conlon
was already a controversial nominee 
with no law degree and a record
of  shoot first and ask questions later  
you watching 
with his background as a nude life model 
yeah  i m watching it right now 
 the white house is in full crisis mode 
and  get this 
i found five former students
who are willing to go on record
that conlon got noticeably aroused
when he posed for their drawing class 
i have no shame in what i did 
now  should i say  noticeably aroused  
or  engorged   because
i don t want this to read like clickbait 
you know  this is a real article 
i just  kate  can i get
something from you  please 
 clears throat  sorry 
  out of sorts tonight 
  can we have this conversation 
i feel like we re skirting around this 
do you have an issue with my mom 
is that what this is all about 
 music playing on tv 
 woman  you can t tell me what s going on 
it s just the protocol 
please  don t worry 
oh  marshall got a 172
on his lsats and we re celebrating 
way to go  marshall 
i m proud of you  buddy 
  whoo  thank you  dad  miss you 
   chuckles

well  that s better
than last month  right 
you know  just remember to speak up
in the meeting tomorrow  okay 
  yeah  i will 
  you get so quiet 
when it s time to take credit 
you kind of 
she asked you if you were a lesbian 
she did not say that you were a lesbian 
  it was a question 
  hey  look  i m 
can i sit down with your mom
to have lunch in  like  seven months 
seven  that s weirdly
specific and distant 
what is  this is my mom 
 upbeat tense music playing 
 orlean  so  oh 
i heard there s an asteroid
or a comet or something
that you don t like the looks of 
 sighs  tell me about it and then
tell me why you re telling me about it 
you got 20 minutes 
  twenty minutes 
  that s you  doc 
 softly  go  now  go 
uh   clears throat 
madam president   breathing heavily 
 clears throat  uh 
approximately 36 hours ago 
uh  phd candidate
kate dibiasky here discovered
a very large comet 
oh 
   mindy  yeah 
  good for you 
a comet between
five to ten kilometers across 
that we estimate came from the  uh 
from the  from the oort cloud 
 orlean  wow 
which is the outermost part
of the solar system 
and  um 
and using gauss s method
of orbital determination
and the average astrometric uncertainty
of 0 04 arcseconds  we then asked   
   chuckling  whoa  what the hell is  what 
  i m so bored  just tell us what it is 
  what  stop what 
   jason  seriously  stop 
what dr  mindy is trying to say is
there s a comet headed towards earth 
and according to nasa s computers 
that object is gonna hit the pacific ocean
at 62 miles due west
off the coast of chile 
then what happens  like  a tidal wave 
no  it will be far more catastrophic 
there ll be mile high tsunamis
fanning out all across the globe 
if this comet makes impact  it will have
the power of a billion hiroshima bombs 
 exhales sharply  there ll be
magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes   
you re breathing weird 
it s  uh  making me uncomfortable 
i m sorry  i m just trying
to articulate the science 
i know  but it s so stressful 
i m trying to  like  listen   
 mindy  i don t think you understand
the gravity of the situation 
i m trying to articulate it
the best i can   
madam president  this comet
is what we call a planet killer 
 mindy  that is correct 
mmm hmm 
so how certain is this 
there s 100  certainty of impact 
please  don t say 100  
can we just call it
a potentially significant event 
   orlean  yeah 
  yes 
but it isn t potentially going to happen 
it is going to happen 
exactly  99 78  to be exact 
oh  great  okay  so it s not 100  
well  scientists never like to say 100  
call it 70  and let s just move on 
but it s not even close to 70  
you cannot go around saying to people
that there s 100  chance
that they re gonna die 
 chuckling  you know  it s just nuts 
we should get some of
our scientists on this  you know 
no offense  but you re just two people
that walked in here with   
dr  oglethorpe 
dr  ov  ogilvy  yeah 
i ve been head of planetary defense
at nasa for 15 years 
and dr  mindy is a tenured professor
of astronomy at michigan state 
where miss dibiasky
is a doctoral candidate 
   orlean  good 
  i m sorry  did you say michigan state 
exactly  they have
an excellent astronomy department 
   mindy  yes 
  come on  bro 
you kidding 
you wanna see my fucking sat scores 
okay  let s bottom line this 
what is this gonna cost me 
you know  what s the ask here 
there are government plans in place 
um  actions we can take through nasa 
   mindy breathing heavily 
  drones that can be outfitted with nukes
to deflect and hopefully
change the orbit of this comet 
we must act now 
 orlean  oh  hey 
all right  all right  all right 
  when are the midterms  three weeks 
  three weeks 
so  if this breaks before then 
we lose congress 
then there s nothing we can do about it 
it ll be gridlocked 
  the timing is just  it s atrocious 
   drawer opens and closes 
okay  at this very moment 
i say we sit tight and assess 
 jason  sit tight and assess 
 orlean  let s get some other people
on this  some ivy leaguers 
and you and i will review the nasa plans 
  okay 
  i d greatly appreciate that 
am i to understand correctly that 
after all of the information
you ve received today 
the decision you re making
is to  sit tight and assess  
  i m sorry  who is she 
  who the fuck are you  aren t you her son 
i m the fucking chief of staff 
boy with the dragon tattoo 
so i m doing fine 
 whispers  we gotta get out of here 
this place is a freak show 
 mindy  i think what miss dibiasky
is trying to say
is that the idea of sitting tight
is an extremely  extremely dangerous   
oh  oh   laughing 
 sighs 
thank you 
one good thing happened today   chuckles 
okay  funny story   clears throat 
when i was running for president 
i had to sneak cigarettes for
the whole first month of the campaign
because  you know 
photographs of me smoking
went for  what  a hundred grand a pop 
 chuckles 
so  i m always hiding  but 
you know  i just got sick of it 
and i just said   you know what 
i m gonna smoke whenever i want to  
 chuckles  mmm 
guess what happened 
  i went up three points in the polls 
   jason  they loved that she kept it real 
they love watching a smokeshow smoke 
i can t think of another president
that i d ever wanna see in playboy 
do you know how many  uh 
 the world is ending  meetings
that we ve had over the years 
economic collapse  loose nukes 
car exhaust killing the atmosphere 
  rogue ai 
  drought  famine  plague 
  uh 
   orlean  everything 
 chuckles  alien invasion 
population growth  hole in the ozone   
jason  hey 
  read the room for once in your life 
  sorry  mom 
point is  i have a job to do 
you do understand
that this is an apocalyptic event 
this is a large celestial body
heading towards our planet at speeds   
dr  mindy  i hear you 
i hear you 
  you should be proud 
   breathes deeply  thank you 
i m taking it very seriously 
i m taking it straight in the heart 
i m so glad to hear that 
you have no idea 
hey  gang  obviously everything we talked
about in here  super classified  right 
   oglethorpe  yeah 
  cool 
thanks for dressing up 
 upbeat tense music playing 
 mindy  you re saying
we re just gonna leak it to the press 
  isn t that illegal 
  hell yeah  we re going to leak it 
in case you didn t notice 
the white house just blew us off 
my boyfriend  phillip 
says he knows a reporter
from the new york herald
who will talk to us 
  adul grelio 
  good  he s a heavy hitter 
and i ll reach out to more of
the scientific community on the down low 
  i just feel like this isn t what i do 
  you re just telling a story 
keep it simple 
no math 
but it s all math 
 music continues playing 
 uplifting electronic music playing 
 male voice on video  it all started
with a connection

so many choices 
sometimes  it can even feel like too much

into your every feeling and desire
without you needing
to say one single word 
if i feel 
  sad 
   boy  afraid 
or alone 
the bash 14 3 phone 
when set to the life setting 
instantly senses my mood
through blood pressure 
  uh  heartbeats and   
   phone chimes 
 automated voice  your vitals
show that you are sad 
this will cheer you up  peter 
 girl    you are my best friend
you are my best friend  
 singing indistinctly 
  you make me happy   
 peter laughing  oh  that s wonderful 
that video  um

a therapy session
with a nearby professional 
so we can make sure that
these sad feelings never ever ever return 
  may i say something  mr  isherwell 
   peter  no 
and to support  uh  bash liif 
uh  i wanna officially announce 
oh  give me the phones  they re not yours 
   softly  say bye 
  bye  mr  isherwell 
bye  peter 
um  i love you  peter 
are you sure the video
of the puppy on the rooster

sense memory consumer sector 
i find the bird quite threatening 
we will cross check
the data on that  for sure 
mr  isherwell  paul debent
wanted me to give this to you 
he got it from
an astronomer friend of his in mexico 
oh  my 
what other confirmation
do we have on this  adul 
 adul  i ve spoken to dr  oglethorpe in dc
and he confirmed it and all the math 
then i showed it
to dr  franks at columbia 
and he almost fell out of his chair 
so  look  i have to admit 
i was very skeptical at first 
but this is all quite credible 
the calculations are credible 
jesus 
and the president
really said to sit tight 
   mindy  yes  that s correct 
   sit tight and assess  
she s probably worried about the midterms 
we need to move fast 
the feds will claim breach of security 
so make sure these two
get a pro bono attorney 
   woman 1  you can use my attorney 
  you can certainly afford it now 
we re gonna hire a lawyer 
   woman 1  that wasn t necessary 
   woman 2  it was 
i m sorry  i m sorry  sorry 
that was not called for 
 mindy  i just have a question here 
how is it criminal if we just tell people 
like the public  you know 
what we saw  and tell them the truth 
make sure this one gets media training
before he hits the shows 
he seems a step slow 
what does that mean 
i need media training

what it will officially be named

   brie  congratulations 
   jack  what an honor  congratulations 
it s somewhere between
six and nine kilometers across 
  so   
  it s big 
it would damage the entire planet

the entire planet 
okay  as it s damaging 
will it hit this one house in particular
that s right on the coast of new jersey 
it s my ex wife s house 
can we make that happen

we re trying to tell you
that the entire planet
is about to be destroyed 
   jack  okay  um 
   brie  well  it s  you know 
it s something we do around here 
we just keep the bad news light 
right  it helps the medicine go down 
speaking of medicine  tomorrow we ve got   
well  maybe the destruction
of the entire planet
isn t supposed to be fun 
maybe it s supposed to be terrifying 
and unsettling 
 adul  no  please don t do that 
  and you should stay up all night 
   adul  please 
 every night crying 
when we re all 100 
for sure gonna fucking die

 jack and brie chuckle 
listen  if you don t have enough 
we all have enough around here for her 
a spoonful of xanax
makes the medicine go down  right 
 jack  that s right  that s good 
  we re gonna have to get you back 
   jack  i knew i d like this guy 
  is he a plant   laughing 
   jack  i knew it 
 brie  okay 
well  the handsome astronomer
can come back anytime 
but the yelling lady  not so much 
 jack  not so much  join us tomorrow
when our guest will be the man
that many say will challenge
president orlean in two years 
senator jeff lerner will be here 
and wrongly convicted murderer 
michelle weems 
talks to us about her controversial
third place finish on celebrity dance off 
  i thought she would ve won 
  yes  i still think she s guilty 
  that s the daily rip  guys 
   brie  have a great day 
   producer  and we re out 
  the show s over 
  i mean  didn t 
   jack  yeah 
  did what we wanted to say come across

uh  we usually get drinks at aundrine s
after our five o clock staff meeting

   camera clicks 
  thank you 
 woman  you can see this spike here
is when riley bina
asked to take dj chello back
on the segment before you 
we saw engagement across
all social media platforms 
hmm  and what about our story 
 woman  randall and kate 
  an8 your tv appearance got some nice traffic
when miss dibiasky cursed 
  an8 but  unfortunately 
there was an immediate backlash
  an8   that quickly became a meme 
   kate gasps 
oh  jesus 
  oh  that s terrible 
  they just think i m crazy 
i mean  look at that 
that s so unnecessary 
  you can move on  erin 
  yeah 
that is just so 
is that even allowed on the internet or 
i think that s photoshop  kate 
 erin  the trick is
to not take it personal 
 chuckling  dr  mindy  on the other hand 
had some very high favorables 
vegan babe wrote 
 meow  me likey hunky star man  
uh  some accounts called him
 the bedroom eyes doomsday prophet 
or a i l f  which means
 astronomer i d like to fuck  
 people  oh 
i don t see what that has
to do with anything  do you 
and that s everything 
we did not feature or push on any sites 
and clicks overall were below
basic weather and traffic stories 
 scoffs 
so that  that  that s it 
   kate  i knew it 
  that s it 
  thank you  erin 
   erin  yeah  no problem 
 mindy  i don t  i don t understand 
i don t understand  there s no response 
there s absolutely no 
why aren t people terrified 
what do we have to say 
what do we have to do 
there are scientists in mexico and spain
who are currently going through the data 
and  uh  south korea has expressed   
  that s great  south korea 
  hey 
let us not bullshit each other 
the bottom line is 
you guys told us the science was 100  
it s not  now we look like idiots 
  no  who said the science is not 100  
  excuse me 
i wanna talk to this person 
you tell me who said the science   
dr  jocelyn calder  the head of nasa 
just came out calling it
 more near miss hysteria  
she s the one
who told us not to say anything 
 more near miss hysteria  
is she even an astronomer 
she s the head of nasa  but maybe
she doesn t know what she s talking about 
she s the head of nasa  but look 
she s a  former anesthesiologist
and a president orlean super donor  
let s not be dramatic here 
it s all corrupt 
yes  but the point is that adul s right 
there s still serious debate 
and now the herald has egg on its face 
we ve taken that story as far as it goes 
ladies  gentlemen 
i wish you a very pleasant end of times 
 mindy  it s not a goddamn story  okay 
we have precisely six months  ten days 
two hours  11 minutes and 41 seconds 
until a comet twice the size of chicxulub
tears through our atmosphere
and extincts all life on earth 
 chuckles  when did you
do those calculations 
i put the moment of impact on a diet app 
so  impact is when my diet ends 
only i m not on a diet 
i m just crying five times a day 
  i m scared 
  hey  come on  come on 
everyone should be
panicking right now  okay 
  don t cry  come on 
   kate  i know 
 cell phone chimes 
 sighs 
that prick 
 upbeat tense music playing 
 mindy  what happened 
guess my boyfriend just broke up with me 
  god  what a day  what a day 
   crying 
you re gonna die 
you re gonna die  you re 
 slow rumbling 
 reporter on tv  it started with
a photo many thought was an armpit
or the chin of a man with a strange beard 
but what s emerging now is a scandal 
  an8 president orlean sent
her supreme court nominee
  an8 a cell phone picture of her private parts 
  holy crap 
   woman  it s clickbait material 
is this what you want
in your country as a leader 
isn t she the same person
who told poor people
that if they don t wanna be poor 
they should pick better lottery numbers 
she actually said that 
  an8 a source also confirmed to me that
  an8 the two have been
having an affair for years 
and as recently as yesterday 
members of my party
are currently drawing up a formal censure
of the president 
janie orlean 
 mindy  oh  my god  honey 
this guy doesn t even know
what a heliocentric orbit is 
and he s calling me a crackpot   chuckles 
he says that 
 jewish billionaires
invented this comet threat
so the government
can confiscate our liberty and our guns  
  dontbescared   unbelievable 
my god 
you ve been on that site a lot lately 
yeah  i mean  i  i have  like 
a quarter million subscribers  honey 
i gotta use my voice
to get the truth out there  right 
i m  uh  going for a walk
if you wanna come 
 mindy  it is called
the scientific method 
 doorbell rings 
 and it is what created the computer
that you are typing
your half witted conspiracy theories on 
what do you think about that 
 mrs  mindy  randall 
  yeah  honey 
  someone s here to see you 
who  oh  boy 
oh  my gosh 
oh  god  right  okay 
right 
are you dr  randall mindy 
 mindy  yes  sir  i am 
 pensive music playing 
 woman mockingly   we re all gonna die  
fuck off  please 
fbi  freeze  get on your knees right now 
get on your knees 
you re under arrest
for breach of national security secrets 
jesus christ 
you could ve just called me
or showed up to my apartment 
what are you  dressed up as a blind guy 
 siren blaring 
   agent  get on the ground 
  okay  now be cool 
i just have
more skin pigmentation than you 
 cause your ancestors
migrated to northern europe
and developed lighter skin
so as to not get 
 kate  unless you assholes
are taking me to the batcave 
fuck you for putting this hood on me 
watch out for him 
he ll charge you for free shit 
 whispers  what s he doing here 
is he here for us 
gentlemen  you can come in 
 orlean chuckles  i think
it was winston churchill who 
or maybe it was bobby knight
who said   the great labor of leadership
is to lay down one s yoke of pride
and admit that mistakes were made  
 jason  you were deceived 
as was i  but the end result was 
we had our scientists who went to 
uh  the prestigious schools of harvard 
princeton  et cetera 
they confirmed the data 
so we would like to offer you a 
presidential apology 
really 
and we are fully prepared to mobilize
in historic fashion
in order to save this planet 
 laughing 
 man  the best news
we ve heard in a long time 
so  basically  what you re saying is
you re about to lose the midterms
 cause you got caught
sending pictures of your cooch
to your porn star sheriff boyfriend 
so now it s to your advantage
to act on the comet 
right 
 kate  okay 
 chuckling  okay  i m just 
 sighs  god  i m so relieved
that you guys are doing something 
  hey  come on  hey 
  this has been really 
   crying  really  really hard 
  come here 
this has been really  really 
really stressful on all of us 
yes  i will agree 
this will take some
heavy weight off all of us   
 laughing  sorry  you just look
so bad when you cry 
 orlean  maybe  possibly 
people are gonna ask
why we didn t act earlier 
so you re gonna have
to take the hit on this one 
yeah  but we ll take care
of you down the road  jocelyn 
  we will 
  of course  janie 
i will resign in disgrace
first thing tomorrow 
   orlean  good  yeah  good 
  that s weird as hell 
 whispers  she s an anesthesiologist 
i m going to make a statement 
presidential statement
to the american people 
and we re not gonna tell
the press about it ahead of time
because that way
it will have the appearance
of a breaking emergency sort of 
 woman on tv  good things

   device chimes on tv 
   woman on tv  see 
 man on tv  whoo 
oh  my god

 rhythmic music playing on tv 
 man on tv  we interrupt this broadcast
of jackpot fiancé
for an emergency message
from the president of the united states 
citizens of the united states
and peoples of the world 
i have just been handed
scientific findings that
confirm a worst case scenario 
an unprecedented comet 
nine kilometers wide 
is now on a direct collision course
with our cherished home  planet earth 
  an8 estimated time of arrival
is approximately five months from now 
  an8 so we have 
we ve drawn up a massive
congressional spending bill 
i have already put together an emergency
spending package for congress 
 jason   that the senate
and the house have agreed upon 
that s good to hear 
and that will enable nasa
and our great military
to launch a preemptive strike 
using decommissioned
space shuttles and satellites
loaded with nuclear explosives 
we will blow comet dibiasky
off her course 
but we re gonna need a hero 
we re gonna need a pilot  real guns and 
shouldn t this mission be accomplished
using remote technology 
washington s always gotta have a hero 
i have asked
medal of freedom recipient
and outspoken patriot  benedict drask 
to undertake this difficult and 
 mindy  i m sorry 
isn t he the mercenary gentleman
that was screaming at all those children
on the white house lawn 
 orlean  yeah 
he was given the honor of leading
the presidential initiative
in getting kids to exercise 
get a little air into it  you lard ass 
you look like a goddamn bunch of pussies 
   mindy  i m sorry 
  he s just of another generation 
you know  i used to date him

i worked with in combat 
you ever see inside a man s torso 
 cheers and applause

and special thanks should also go

 orlean  we re gonna need
everybody s help on this 
everybody 
all have to pitch in
and push out this message 
 african american scientist 
miss dibiasky  she 
and we have kate dibiasky 
who the comet is named after 
but don t blame her 
 connects with the disaffected youth
and the mentally ill 
  and other marginal groups 
  thank you 
   oglethorpe  we ll do whatever we can 
  as long as you do the right thing 
we re there for you

wonderful  well  i think we re done 
 jason  yep  okay  let s go 
 kate  can i say something 
we ve been dying to hear

 soaring music continues 
 man on radio  separation confirmed 
  separation confirmed 
  whoo 
 speaking french 
was that french 
yes  it is  it means   the angels soar
to the heavens   it s  um 
it s from a 14th century poem
i studied in dartmouth 
and just watching this 
it just made me think of it 
and think of you 
god  i can t 
can t 
 upbeat tense music playing 
  an8  men chanting  go  go  go 
  an8    groans 
   laughter 
  an8 i think i probably should go
to the  bleep  hospital and see what they 
  an8  people on video  launch challenge 
  an8  people chanting on video  go  go  go 
everyone  i have just received
some critical information
concerning our mission 
 people clamoring 
looks like it s turning around 
no  it s not  it s a course correction 
it s pretty standard 
i was in the navy 
nope  it s turning around 
 reporter  seems to be
some confusion here amongst the crowd 
but i m not gonna lie to you 
this reporter
is at a loss for words right now 
it s definitely turning around 
i m looking straight at it 
drask s ship is definitely turning around 
does anyone know
what the fuck just happened 
it s still locked 
i just don t  i don t understand
what could ve happened 
i mean  the mission was working  right 
everything was on track 
yeah  i mean 
it could ve been anything  uh 
guidance system could ve malfunctioned 
uh  nuke destabilized  myriad of things 
who was that guy that walked into
the situation room  he looked familiar 
that was peter isherwell  ceo of bash 
and the third richest human ever 
he s the guy that  uh  bought
the gutenberg bible and lost it 
 door opens 
 jason  sorry to keep you waiting 
things are  uh  extremely fluid 
dr  randall  you are now the chief
science advisor to the white house 
what 
as such  you need to attend
an emergency cabinet meeting
where you will be debriefed 
what about us 
you do not have clearance
for this  sweetheart  don t trip 
got you some crackers  some waters 
you don t need to throw it on the floor 
gonna be three  four hours  tops 
here  kate  i don t know
why he threw  em down  here 
what if we have to go to the bathroom 
we ll lay out some newspaper for you 
grab you a can of febreze 
 oglethorpe  short  sweet
and simple science 
i ll be back  all right  come on 
 oglethorpe 
science tells the truth  randall 
 sighs 
fuck  do you wanna come 
yeah 
 orlean  ladies and gentlemen 
what we thought 
what the world thought
was an impending and terrifying danger 
turns out to be
an astonishing opportunity 
our allies are very confused
and demanding answers   
well  tell  em to wait 
according to the most recent
spectrometer readings of comet dibiasky 
made by the astrogeologists
at bash cellular 
we ve discovered something 
something truly miraculous 
peter  peter 
  oh  thank you  janie 
   chuckles 
as  uh  as some of you may know 
the most valuable minerals in the world
are fast becoming those that are deployed
in the manufacture
of cell phones and  uh  computers 
yttrium  terbium  osmium  dysprosium 
on and on and on 
we re running short 
uh  and the problem
is exacerbated  of course 
because china has her big panda paw
firmly on almost all the mines
that produce
these valuable rare earth assets 
so you can imagine   laughing 
wow 
just how happy we were at bash
when our astrogeologists discovered
and then determined that this comet 
hurtling towards us from deep space 
actually contains at least  32 trillion
of these critical materials 
critical to technology 
if we re to proceed   
i m sorry  is that why
you aborted this entire mission 
is because you re trying to mine
the comet for rare minerals 
 orlean  i think
we should hold all questions
until the end of the presentation 
and you might find
that your questions are answered 
yes  madam president 
when you 
when the other metals are factored in 
the comet actually contains
almost  140 trillion worth of assets 
 jason  buck forty trilli 
   orlean  yeah 
   laughter 
what do these trillions of dollars
even matter if we re all gonna die   
 woman  i was about to ask
the same question  janie 
why weren t we consulted 
all due respect  madam president 
oh  no  what if we re rich and we re safe 
 kate  i ve gone over it
again and again and again in my head
and i still can t make sense of it 
he s a three star general 
he works at the pentagon 
why would he charge us for free snacks 
one time  i met sting 
and i swear to god 
he farted right in front of me 
didn t break eye contact
and didn t even say  excuse me  
and the thing is 
he actually pulled it off   chuckles 
 cause i still found him
to be quite charming 
 whispering  guys  we have to talk 
come on  let s go  come on  now 
it s insane  like  completely insane 
 kate  it will never work 
i had the exact same reaction 
this is a nine kilometer wide
planet killer we re talking about 
not roaming charges 
look  i  i was confused and outraged
that they turned this mission around too 
but they ve got
gary talcamont from stanford
and lisa inez from princeton
on their team 
i mean  this is next generation
cutting edge technology 
obviously  one giant comet is a major
and existential  uh  threat to our planet 
but 30 smaller meteoroids  we can handle 
our beads  that stands for
bash  uh  explore and acquire drones 
that you see here 
attach themselves to the comet
and scan it with nanotechnology
developed by
nobel prize winning scientist 
dr  gary talcamont 
and then we immediately deploy  don t we 
nobel and polonsky prize winning scientist
dr  inez s micro targeted 
quantum fission  uh  explosives 
you see  deep into the object 
dr  inez  would you like
to explain what s happening 
thank you  peter 
we ve been developing
phase fission reactions
in the cern particle accelerator
that can splinter the comet
into smaller pieces
with breathtaking accuracy 
these segments are then steered
and decelerated by each bead
into the pacific ocean for reclamation
by waiting us navy ships 
and when these  thank you 
and when these treasures
from heaven are claimed 
poverty as we know it 
social injustice  loss of biodiversity 
all these multitudes of problems
are just gonna become relics of the past
and humanity is gonna stride through
the pillars of boaz and jachin naked
into the the glory of a golden age 
and is this nanotech work peer reviewed 
well  i haven t reviewed the data 
but it s been modeled 
has any of this been peer reviewed 
nope 
interplanetary  interstellar 
intergalactic existence
for the human race 
 applause 
 orlean  your mouth to god s ear 
i understand the wealth
that they can extract from this comet 
it can end world hunger 
   oglethorpe  oh  i see 
   kate laughing 
  why are you laughing 
   oglethorpe  that s true  no  i see 
so that s the pretty little bow they re
putting around this line of bullshit 
i bet they ll say freedom and puppies too 
  all right 
  yeah 
you want me to quit the mission 
i ll quit the mission  that s fine 
but you have to understand 
this is now beyond our control 
they have all the power 
so who do you want
in the actual room to make sure
this whole thing doesn t turn out to be
a complete goddamn disaster 
jason orlean 
you want jason orlean in that room  huh 
i have news for you 
it s already a complete disaster 
they re talking about letting
a comet the size of a mountain
hit the planet to jack up
a cell phone company s stock 
you better take that down
about four or five notches now 
were you yelling about that mission 
why were you talking about cell phones 
my friend was just theorizing
as to what s going on 
we re confused too 
that s an awfully official looking
white house badge you got there 
i don t know why i have this on 
listen  just tell us what s going on 
i got three scared kids at home 
just tell us something 
i understand 
i wish i could share information  but   
we re people just like you 
we deserve to know 
they re right 
they deserve to know 
do you really wanna know what s going on 
   woman  yeah 
   man  please 
   oglethorpe  kate  don t  kate 
   mindy  kate 
they found a bunch of gold and diamonds
and rare shit on the comet 
 sighs 
so they re gonna let it hit the planet
to make a bunch of rich people
even more disgustingly rich 
 woman  fuck you 
 people clamoring 
 people shouting and screaming 
 officer  no camera 
 everything i could  they won t listen 
 kate  surprise  surprise 
now  i m starting to think
you just like riling people up 
i m so sorry  kate  really  i am 
 kate  oh  randall  god

well  she ain t wrong 
you did lose the thread in a big way 
and what do you suggest we do 
an online petition  huh 
you want to hold 
get a mob and hold up picket signs 
you wanna overthrow the government 
i mean  look at this 
 kate  i can t  my head is in a bag

 laughter 
are you at all concerned about
the sync on the bead explosions 
oh  doctor 
there are always questions and fears  and 
i have a report here from a dr  inez 
  if you d just take a look at this study 
  oh  thanks 
listen  a lot of my colleagues 
they ve either been removed
or resigned from this project 
apparently for asking too many questions
about this mission here 
so i just wanna make sure that you re 
that you re open
to the scientific peer review process
and you re not approaching
this mission like a businessman 
  you know  that   
  what did you say 
  i wanna know if you re   
  did you call me a businessman 
  you do own a corporate   
  you think i m just a businessman 
do you think you know me  doctor 
business 
this is evolution 
this is evolution of the human species 
  what are you doing bringing this 
   orlean  well   
you know that bash has
over 40 million data points on you 
on every decision you have made
since 1994  doctor 
i  i know when you have colon polyps
months before your doctor does 
you got four or five
at the moment actually 
you know  they re not of concern 
but i d have a checkup as soon as you can 
but much more importantly than that 
i know what you are  i know who you are 
my algorithms have determined
eight fundamental consumer profile types 
you are a lifestyle idealist 
you think you re motivated
by beliefs  high ethical beliefs 
but you just run towards pleasure
and away from pain 
like a  like a field mouse 
 mindy  i m just trying to 
 inhales deeply 
i just wanna make sure
that the science is sound on this project 
i hope you understand   
our algorithms
can even predict how you ll die 
to 96  96 5  accuracy 
i looked you up after we met 
your death was so unremarkable and boring 
i can t remember the details 
apart from one thing 
you re gonna die alone 
alone 
if you ll excuse me  madam president 
i ve got some work to do 
 orlean  what the hell are you doing 
  my god 
  i was trying to do my job 
you are just so lucky
that peter adores you 
 sighs 
you re with the grown ups now  randall 
i can t even follow this shit anymore 
   music playing on speakers 
   indistinct chatter 
bash got orlean to pay
the chilean government  if i m correct 
 90 billion to let the tsunami
hit off the coast of the country 
that sound right to you 
 man 3  isherwell built
an underground bunker
for him and all his executives 
no  i heard that
they built an escape ship 
you guys 
the truth is way more depressing 
they re not even smart enough to be
as evil as you re giving them credit for 
 glass shatters 
 people clamoring  cheering 
ugh 
  what 
  no 
 people shouting 
fuck  you re driving me fucking
crazy  kate   chuckles nervously 
fuck it  we re all gonna die 
   sun  ice cream  
  you smooth like felt
soft to the touch  
  you wear repellent

harry s just a mug  
  i m stood outside waiting
where you gone   
  cubicle lines
catch a cold  jack frost  
 jack   movie will be released
the day that some believe
comet dibiasky will impact the planet 
and the early word is
it s already a classic  brie 
 brie  oh  yes 
well  and what a stellar cast 
  devin  yeah 
  i love devin peters 
he s great  everything he does 
  what s it called again 
   jack  it s called total devastation 
  it cost  300 million to make 
   brie  whoo 
  i mean  these movies   
   laughs  it s more than you earn 
 jack  tell me about it 
and my friend farley  he saw it 
  he said it s a ton of fun  that s right 
  well  farley likes it 
all right  well  what farley says goes 
but  uh  first 
and yes  you can tell from my smile 
 chuckles  stop it 
that america s sexiest scientist is here 
dr  randall  welcome 
dr  randall  how are you  sir 
 sighs  i m    i m good 
i m gooder than good 
 laughter 
all right  so  randall  we re hearing
that there is no comet 
or that there is a comet but it s
a good thing or maybe it s a bad thing 
we are so confused   chuckles 
so  could you please help us out here 
you know  oh  wise scientist 
well  first and foremost  brie  um 
 sniffs   there most certainly
is a comet 
 brie  all right 
and we know that there is a comet
because we have the data 
um   clears throat 
there has been growing concern within
the scientific community as of late 
you see  the peer review process
is absolutely essential 
  if bash s stock 
   for us to get to the facts of  yes 
if bash s stock is any indicator 
we don t have to worry
about the peer review 
it is going gangbusters 
and full disclosure 
i bought as many shares as i could 
i advise you to do the same 
you are such a shameless capitalist 
said the woman who will be
in the brand new hot tub on my back deck
  when i put it in from the stock 
  you know me too well 
that s right 
dr  randall  you sure you re okay 
you want a glass of water 
i don t feel so good 
 brie  so i think we ll go
to commercial break   
no  please  brie  don t cut away 
let me say something 
  okay 
  you came to the right place 
we like to say things 
would you please
just stop being so  bleep  pleasant 
i m sorry  but not everything
needs to sound so goddamn clever
or charming or likeable all the time 
sometimes we need to just be able
to say things to one another 
we need to hear things 
look  let s establish  once again 
that there is a huge comet
headed towards earth 
and the reason we know
that there is a comet
is because we saw it 
we saw it with our own eyes
using a telescope 
i mean  for god s sake 
we took a fucking picture of it 
what other proof do we need 
and if we can t all agree
at the bare minimum
that a giant comet
the size of mount everest
hurtling its way towards planet earth
is not a fucking good thing 
then what the hell happened to us 
i mean  my god  how do   
how do we even talk to each other 
what ve we  what ve we done to ourselves 
how do we fix it 
we should have deflected this comet
when we had the fucking chance 
but we didn t do it 
i don t know why we didn t do it 
and now they re
actually firing scientists like me
for speaking out  for opposing them 
and i m sure many of the people out there
aren t even
gonna listen to what i just said
 cause they have
their own political ideology 
but i  assure you 
i am not on one side or the other 
i m just telling you the fucking truth 
this would be a good time to establish
that isherwell and the president
have both said
that there s benefits to be   
right  well  the president
of the united states is fucking lying 
look  i m just like all of you 
i hope to god  i hope to god that
this president knows what she s doing 
i hope she s got us all taken care of 
but the truth is 
i think this whole administration
has completely lost their fucking mind 
and i think we re all gonna die 
 breathing heavily 
 softly  look  i just wanna go home 
 sighs  i just wanna go home 
i just wanna go home more than anything 
 breathing heavily 
but if there is one thing 
one thing that i pray 
that i pray that all of you hear
from what i have just said 
is that all of us  all of us 
 car door opens 
 sighs 
why d you do that 
i really liked you
and i despise most people 
 mindy  you know  i 
i really thought i loved you 
really 
wow 
 sighs  that s wild 
  yeah 
   car door opens 
 man  ma am  you need to go 
we gotta get this man off the grid 
 mindy  you still there 
no 
 kate  well  maybe he just gets off
on the power  you know 
like any kind of power 
it s like he knew eventually that i was
gonna find out that the snacks were free 
  right 
  you know what i mean 
  yeah 
  so it was just like a power play 
yeah  guys are weird 
i m starting to think that all this
 end of the world  stuff is bullshit 
it s not 
it s definitely happening  i ve seen it 
i feel like if god wanted to destroy
the earth  he would destroy the earth 
you believe in god 
yeah  i mean 
my parents raised me evangelical 
and i hate them 
but i found my own way to it 
my own relationship 
 kate  hmm 
i d appreciate it
if you didn t advertise it  though 
i won t tell anybody   chuckles 
i think it s kind of sweet 
  wanna make out 
  yeah  why not 
can you not say  why not  
it makes me feel like you don t want it 
it s shitty 
  sure  whatever 
  that s better 
 pop song playing on radio

they re finally seeing it 
 uneasy music continues playing 
there it is 
 grunting 
 cooing 
 bell dinging 
go outside into your yard 
onto a roof  onto your sidewalk 
and just look up into the sky 
the star s gonna appear fuzzy 
it s got a long streak coming off of it 
that s the comet s tail 
it s real and it s coming 
if anyone tells you any different 
they re full of shit 
just look up into the sky 
it s a fucking fact 
  we have proof 
  just look up 
guys  please just look up  okay 
screw the manatees and just look up 
 both  just look up 
   all  just look up

dr  mindy  the president s
plan to save earth
and make it so we can all have a home
is going to work  right 
every single man  woman and child
on this planet is going to die 
  i don t like him  he makes me sad 
  i m sorry about that 
  this is not what we rehearsed 
  kids  listen 
you tell your parents
that president orlean and isherwell
are sociopaths and fascists 
 cheers and applause 
and do you know why
they want you to look up 
do you know why 
 cause they want you to be afraid 
 audience cheering 
they want you to look up
because they are
looking down their noses at you 
they think they re better than you 
   hip hop tune plays 
   chanting  don t look up 
they wanna rob you of your freedom 
and that s a fact 
 chanting  don t look up 
the us president  orlean 
   crowd clamoring 
   man yelling  just look up 
 has not included india
or any other nation in the world
to be a part of this mission 
this dude is a known pornographer
named kip 
don t listen to that dumbfuck 
the united nations have been
considering its own deflective mission 
   laughing 
  just look up  for fuck s sake 
 woman  now i know a lot of hollywood
is supporting the just look up movement 
but i haven t seen a pin like that 
yeah  this pin points both up and down 
because i think  as a country 
we need to stop arguing
and virtue signaling  just get along 
   woman  that is so refreshing 
  hmm 
 woman  i think
we re all tired of the politics 
yeah  yeah  well 
that s why we made total devastation 
it s for everyone  you know 
it s a popcorn movie 
you keep your eye on the road ahead 
you put your head down 
and you put
one foot in front of the other 
step by step 
 people cheering 
 orlean  day by day 
   people chanting  don t look up 
  don t 
 captivating music playing 
so we wanna say something loud and clear 
there is no safe way
to bring this comet back to earth
and exploit it for profit 
it cannot be done 
nations of the world 
defy orlean and bash 
launch your own nuclear deflection mission
now and save this planet 
 breathing heavily 
and now  uh  there s riley bina

  riding against all odds but soon
against ourselves  
  you haunted every memory  
  with no goodbyes out there for me  
  your pride put out the fire
in our flame  
  then just one look is all it takes  
  i feel your eyes
they re locked on every part of me  
  and then my dumb heart says  
  just look up  
  there is no place to hide  
  true love doesn t die  
  it holds on tight
and never lets you go   
is that a rock solid ten smokeshow
of a president or what
