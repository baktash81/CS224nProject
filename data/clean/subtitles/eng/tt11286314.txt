its a party
im im just so
so thrilled for you kate
to comet dibiasky right cheers
its gotta be look
its gotta be an oort cloud comet
just based on where you saw it
probably the last time
it was this close to the sun
was long before human civilization
look at the arc on that thing
god its amazing
how would we find out the comets
velocity in orbit professor mindy
that is a good question sighs
this will be fun i havent done
orbital dynamics since grad school
question is what
what would carl sagan do
he would take it back to first principles
the topocentric vector is rho
kate what are the initial coordinates
kate twentyone
twentyfour
thirteen
mindy this is fun huh guys
sixtyseven
wow now you got me pumped
man 1 dr mindy
all right
how many terms do you have to calibrate
mindy approximation
of coordinates in marsden 85
now that we have the comets orbit
we will check the ephemeris
and that will give us the distance
between the comet and planet earth
why does the ephemeris
keep getting lower and lower
breathes deeply
professor mindy
professor mindy
you know what guys lets
lets call it a night huh
man 2 but what about
the relative position
i cant figure this one out
not tonight guys sorry
man 1 lets hit it man im beat
woman 2 me too
man 1 kate this was amazing
man 2 congratulations
hey kate
you stay
phone dialing
line ringing
man yeah uh dr calder
a michigan state professor
and his grad students
this is dr calder
you pulled me out of a meeting
where i had to tell my team
we lost eight billion in funding
i am so sorry dr calder
but we are seeing some
awfully strange orbital numbers
on this comet we just found
they should be in your inbox right
calder is this it
yeah this is it
oh yeah yeah let me get
dr oglethorpe on the line
please hold
uh uh im on hold
shes calling a dr oglethorpe
who is that
jesus christ
im gonna put them on speaker
music playing on speaker
dr oglethorpe
head of the planetary
defense coordination office
is that a real place
i have no idea
music continues playing
man on speaker this is dr oglethorpe
yes this is jocelyn calder
from kennedy space center
oglethorpe hey jocelyn
listen we got a sighting
of an neo from subaru telescope
okay uh
why you just didnt report it
to the minor planet center
calder its a professor
and a bunch of michigan state students
who identified something big
really how large
calder how big we talking
we clocked it in around
five to ten kilometers wide
about five to ten kilometers wide
uh thats a big boy
and uh was this professor the one
who first made the observations
hi yes uh dr mindy
and and no
phd candidate kate dibiasky found it
i did the orbital calculations
i uh i study trace gasses
in dead galaxies
i havent published in a while
so you probably havent heard of me
but anyway that doesnt matter
sorry what was your question
what are the most updated estimates
on its trajectory
mindy kate
um
ive been running it all day
i keep getting the same result
a direct hit of earth
in six months and 14 days
me too
calder matthew
what are your calculations
um scout program
is saying six months 14 days
calder we got six months and 14 days
and its roughly five
to ten kilometers wide
which which uh
mindy isnt that
an extinctionlevel event
well lets not be dramatic here
okay uh
first move is to get
the school field trip out here to dc
calder lets all calm down
i need the person who first had eyes
on the comet
and the person in charge
what
indistinct chatter
share this data immediately
with cambridge caltech and iau
wait a minute
this is classified information
mindy whats happening
calder i serve
at the discretion of the president
is this really happening
and the dead galaxy professor
to hickam air force base
mindy dc right
hey hey kate clapping

but they never called us in
i couldnt believe it
of course they didnt call you in
kate have you watched any news today
no ive been pretty wrapped up
in our project
turn on your tv right now
president orlean is in
the middle of an alltime shit storm
reporter sheriff wade conlon
was already a controversial nominee
with no law degree and a record
of shoot first and ask questions later
you watching
with his background as a nude life model
yeah im watching it right now
the white house is in full crisis mode
and get this
i found five former students
who are willing to go on record
that conlon got noticeably aroused
when he posed for their drawing class
i have no shame in what i did
now should i say noticeably aroused
or engorged because
i dont want this to read like clickbait
you know this is a real article
i just kate can i get
something from you please
clears throat sorry
out of sorts tonight
can we have this conversation
i feel like were skirting around this
do you have an issue with my mom
is that what this is all about
music playing on tv
woman you cant tell me whats going on
its just the protocol
please dont worry
oh marshall got a 172
on his lsats and were celebrating
way to go marshall
im proud of you buddy
whoo thank you dad miss you

you get so quiet
when its time to take credit
you kind of
she asked you if you were a lesbian
she did not say that you were a lesbian
it was a question
hey look im
can i sit down with your mom
to have lunch in like seven months
seven thats weirdly
specific and distant
what is this is my mom
upbeat tense music playing
orlean so oh
i heard theres an asteroid
or a comet or something
that you dont like the looks of
sighs tell me about it and then
tell me why youre telling me about it
you got 20 minutes
twenty minutes
thats you doc
softly go now go
uh clears throat
madam president breathing heavily
clears throat uh
approximately 36 hours ago
uh phd candidate
kate dibiasky here discovered
a very large comet
oh
mindy yeah
good for you
a comet between
five to ten kilometers across
that we estimate came from the uh
from the from the oort cloud
orlean wow
which is the outermost part
of the solar system
and um
and using gausss method
of orbital determination
and the average astrometric uncertainty
of 004 arcseconds we then asked
chuckling whoa what the hell is what
im so bored just tell us what it is
what stop what
jason seriously stop
what dr mindy is trying to say is
theres a comet headed towards earth
and according to nasas computers
that object is gonna hit the pacific ocean
at 62 miles due west
off the coast of chile
then what happens like a tidal wave
no it will be far more catastrophic
therell be milehigh tsunamis
fanning out all across the globe
if this comet makes impact it will have
the power of a billion hiroshima bombs
exhales sharply therell be
magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes
youre breathing weird
its uh making me uncomfortable
im sorry im just trying
to articulate the science
i know but its so stressful
im trying to like listen
mindy i dont think you understand
the gravity of the situation
im trying to articulate it
the best i can
madam president this comet
is what we call a planetkiller
mindy that is correct
mmmhmm
so how certain is this
theres 100 certainty of impact
please dont say 100
can we just call it
a potentially significant event
orlean yeah
yes
but it isnt potentially going to happen
it is going to happen
exactly 9978 to be exact
oh great okay so its not 100
well scientists never like to say 100
call it 70 and lets just move on
but its not even close to 70
you cannot go around saying to people
that theres 100 chance
that theyre gonna die
chuckling you know its just nuts
we should get some of
our scientists on this you know
no offense but youre just two people
that walked in here with
dr oglethorpe
dr ov ogilvy yeah
ive been head of planetary defense
at nasa for 15 years
and dr mindy is a tenured professor
of astronomy at michigan state
where miss dibiasky
is a doctoral candidate
orlean good
im sorry did you say michigan state
exactly they have
an excellent astronomy department
mindy yes
come on bro
you kidding
you wanna see my fucking sat scores
okay lets bottom line this
what is this gonna cost me
you know whats the ask here
there are government plans in place
um actions we can take through nasa
mindy breathing heavily
drones that can be outfitted with nukes
to deflect and hopefully
change the orbit of this comet
we must act now
orlean oh hey
all right all right all right
when are the midterms three weeks
three weeks
so if this breaks before then
we lose congress
then theres nothing we can do about it
itll be gridlocked
the timing is just its atrocious
drawer opens and closes
okay at this very moment
i say we sit tight and assess
jason sit tight and assess
orlean lets get some other people
on this some ivy leaguers
and you and i will review the nasa plans
okay
id greatly appreciate that
am i to understand correctly that
after all of the information
youve received today
the decision youre making
is to sit tight and assess
im sorry who is she
who the fuck are you arent you her son
im the fucking chief of staff
boy with the dragon tattoo
so im doing fine
whispers we gotta get out of here
this place is a freak show
mindy i think what miss dibiasky
is trying to say
is that the idea of sitting tight
is an extremely extremely dangerous
oh oh laughing
sighs
thank you
one good thing happened today chuckles
okay funny story clears throat
when i was running for president
i had to sneak cigarettes for
the whole first month of the campaign
because you know
photographs of me smoking
went for what a hundred grand a pop
chuckles
so im always hiding but
you know i just got sick of it
and i just said you know what
im gonna smoke whenever i want to
chuckles mmm
guess what happened
i went up three points in the polls
jason they loved that she kept it real
they love watching a smokeshow smoke
i cant think of another president
that id ever wanna see in playboy
do you know how many uh
the world is ending meetings
that weve had over the years
economic collapse loose nukes
car exhaust killing the atmosphere
rogue ai
drought famine plague
uh
orlean everything
chuckles alien invasion
population growth hole in the ozone
jason hey
read the room for once in your life
sorry mom
point is i have a job to do
you do understand
that this is an apocalyptic event
this is a large celestial body
heading towards our planet at speeds
dr mindy i hear you
i hear you
you should be proud
breathes deeply thank you
im taking it very seriously
im taking it straight in the heart
im so glad to hear that
you have no idea
hey gang obviously everything we talked
about in here super classified right
oglethorpe yeah
cool
thanks for dressing up
upbeat tense music playing
mindy youre saying
were just gonna leak it to the press
isnt that illegal
hell yeah were going to leak it
in case you didnt notice
the white house just blew us off
my boyfriend phillip
says he knows a reporter
from the new york herald
who will talk to us
adul grelio
good hes a heavy hitter
and ill reach out to more of
the scientific community on the downlow
i just feel like this isnt what i do
youre just telling a story
keep it simple
no math
but its all math
music continues playing
uplifting electronic music playing
male voice on video it all started
with a connection
a simple gesture that created so much
so many choices
sometimes it can even feel like too much
until now
introducing bash liif
life without the stress of living
cheers and applause
woman on pa before we introduce
the founder and ceo of bash
please remember
to avoid direct eye contact
sudden movements
coughing or negative facial expressions
and now please welcome
sir peter isherwell
cheers and applause
man 1 we love you peter
audience cheering loudly
man 2 we love you peter
hello everyone
all of my lifes work
really i see has been driven
by an inexpressible need for a friend
who would understand and soothe me
and you know now all those years of work
have come to fruition with bash liif
our new bash 143 uh phone
is fully integrated
into your every feeling and desire
without you needing
to say one single word
if i feel
sad
boy afraid
or alone
the bash 143 phone
when set to the life setting
instantly senses my mood
through blood pressure
uh heartbeats and
phone chimes
automated voice your vitals
show that you are sad
this will cheer you up peter
girl  you are my best friend
you are my best friend
singing indistinctly
you make me happy
peter laughing oh thats wonderful
that video um
it also seriously uh schedules
a therapy session
with a nearby professional
so we can make sure that
these sad feelings never ever ever return
may i say something mr isherwell
peter no
and to support uh bash liif
uh i wanna officially announce
oh give me the phones theyre not yours
softly say bye
bye mr isherwell
bye peter
um i love you peter
are you sure the video
of the puppy on the rooster
is optimizing our prepubescent
sense memory consumer sector
i find the bird quite threatening
we will crosscheck
the data on that for sure
mr isherwell paul debent
wanted me to give this to you
he got it from
an astronomer friend of his in mexico
oh my
what other confirmation
do we have on this adul
adul ive spoken to dr oglethorpe in dc
and he confirmed it and all the math
then i showed it
to dr franks at columbia
and he almost fell out of his chair
so look i have to admit
i was very skeptical at first
but this is all quite credible
the calculations are credible
jesus
and the president
really said to sit tight
mindy yes thats correct
sit tight and assess
shes probably worried about the midterms
we need to move fast
the feds will claim breach of security
so make sure these two
get a pro bono attorney
woman 1 you can use my attorney
you can certainly afford it now
were gonna hire a lawyer
woman 1 that wasnt necessary
woman 2 it was
im sorry im sorry sorry
that was not called for
mindy i just have a question here
how is it criminal if we just tell people
like the public you know
what we saw and tell them the truth
make sure this one gets media training
before he hits the shows
he seems a step slow
what does that mean
i need media training
they want us on a show
called the daily rip

before the article comes out
you guys know what the daily rip is
its like the best show
everyone wants to be on it

what it will officially be named
jack after her

thats so unnecessary
you can move on erin

veganbabe wrote
meow me likey hunky star man
uh some accounts called him
the bedroom eyes doomsday prophet
or ailf which means
astronomer id like to fuck
people oh
i dont see what that has
to do with anything do you
and thats everything
we did not feature or push on any sites
and clicks overall were below
basic weather and traffic stories
scoffs
so that that thats it
kate i knew it
thats it
thank you erin
erin yeah no problem
mindy i dont i dont understand
i dont understand theres no response
theres absolutely no
why arent people terrified
what do we have to say
what do we have to do
there are scientists in mexico and spain
who are currently going through the data
and uh south korea has expressed
thats great south korea
hey
let us not bullshit each other
the bottom line is
you guys told us the science was 100
its not now we look like idiots
no who said the science is not 100
excuse me
i wanna talk to this person
you tell me who said the science
dr jocelyn calder the head of nasa
just came out calling it
more nearmiss hysteria
shes the one
who told us not to say anything
more nearmiss hysteria
is she even an astronomer
shes the head of nasa but maybe
she doesnt know what shes talking about
shes the head of nasa but look
shes a former anesthesiologist
and a president orlean super donor
lets not be dramatic here
its all corrupt
yes but the point is that aduls right
theres still serious debate
and now the herald has egg on its face
weve taken that story as far as it goes
ladies gentlemen
i wish you a very pleasant end of times
mindy its not a goddamn story okay
we have precisely six months ten days
two hours 11 minutes and 41 seconds
until a comet twice the size of chicxulub
tears through our atmosphere
and extincts all life on earth
chuckles when did you
do those calculations
i put the moment of impact on a diet app
so impact is when my diet ends
only im not on a diet
im just crying five times a day

slow rumbling
reporter on tv it started with
a photo many thought was an armpit
or the chin of a man with a strange beard
but whats emerging now is a scandal
an8president orlean sent
her supreme court nominee
an8a cell phone picture of her private parts
holy crap
woman its clickbait material
is this what you want
in your country as a leader
isnt she the same person
who told poor people
that if they dont wanna be poor
they should pick better lottery numbers
she actually said that
an8a source also confirmed to me that
an8the two have been
having an affair for years
and as recently as yesterday
members of my party
are currently drawing up a formal censure
of the president
janie orlean
mindy oh my god honey
this guy doesnt even know
what a heliocentric orbit is
and hes calling me a crackpot chuckles
he says that
jewish billionaires
invented this comet threat
so the government
can confiscate our liberty and our guns
dontbescared unbelievable
my god
youve been on that site a lot lately
yeah i mean i i have like
a quarter million subscribers honey
i gotta use my voice
to get the truth out there right
im uh going for a walk
if you wanna come
mindy it is called
the scientific method
doorbell rings
and it is what created the computer
that you are typing
your halfwitted conspiracy theories on
what do you think about that
mrs mindy randall
yeah honey
someones here to see you
who oh boy
oh my gosh

fuck you for putting this hood on me
watch out for him
hell charge you for free shit
whispers whats he doing here
is he here for us
gentlemen you can come in
orlean chuckles i think
it was winston churchill who
or maybe it was bobby knight
who said the great labor of leadership
is to lay down ones yoke of pride
and admit that mistakes were made
jason you were deceived
as was i but the end result was
we had our scientists who went to
uh the prestigious schools of harvard
princeton et cetera
they confirmed the data
so we would like to offer you a
presidential apology
really
and we are fully prepared to mobilize
in historic fashion
in order to save this planet
laughing
man the best news
weve heard in a long time
so basically what youre saying is
youre about to lose the midterms
cause you got caught
sending pictures of your cooch
to your pornstar sheriff boyfriend
so now its to your advantage
to act on the comet
right
kate okay
chuckling okay im just
sighs god im so relieved
that you guys are doing something
hey come on hey
this has been really
crying really really hard
come here
this has been really really
really stressful on all of us
yes i will agree
this will take some
heavy weight off all of us
laughing sorry you just look
so bad when you cry
orlean maybe possibly
people are gonna ask
why we didnt act earlier
so youre gonna have
to take the hit on this one
yeah but well take care
of you down the road jocelyn
we will
of course janie
i will resign in disgrace
first thing tomorrow
orlean good yeah good
thats weird as hell
whispers shes an anesthesiologist
im going to make a statement
presidential statement
to the american people
and were not gonna tell
the press about it ahead of time
because that way
it will have the appearance
of a breaking emergency sort of
woman on tv good things
come to those who wait
device chimes on tv
woman on tv see
man on tv whoo
oh my god
cheers and applause on tv
rhythmic music playing on tv
man on tv we interrupt this broadcast

for an emergency message
from the president of the united states
citizens of the united states
and peoples of the world
i have just been handed
scientific findings that
confirm a worstcase scenario
an unprecedented comet
nine kilometers wide
is now on a direct collision course
with our cherished home planet earth
an8estimated time of arrival
is approximately five months from now
an8so we have
weve drawn up a massive
congressional spending bill
i have already put together an emergency
spending package for congress
jason that the senate
and the house have agreed upon
thats good to hear
and that will enable nasa
and our great military
to launch a preemptive strike
using decommissioned
space shuttles and satellites
loaded with nuclear explosives
we will blow comet dibiasky
off her course
but were gonna need a hero
were gonna need a pilot real guns and
shouldnt this mission be accomplished
using remote technology
washingtons always gotta have a hero
i have asked
medal of freedom recipient
and outspoken patriot benedict drask
to undertake this difficult and
mindy im sorry
isnt he the mercenary gentleman
that was screaming at all those children
on the white house lawn
orlean yeah
he was given the honor of leading
the presidential initiative
in getting kids to exercise
get a little air into it you lardass
you look like a goddamn bunch of pussies
mindy im sorry
hes just of another generation
you know i used to date him
know what happened to the last pussy
i worked with in combat
you ever see inside a mans torso
cheers and applause
benedict drask reporting for duty
thank you for the
hes gonna be fantastic

the extra living my sacrifice gives you

orlean were gonna need
everybodys help on this
everybody

upbeat tense music playing
an8men chanting go go go
an8 groans
laughter
an8i think i probably should go
to the bleep hospital and see what they
an8people on video launch challenge
an8people chanting on video go go go
everyone i have just received
some critical information
concerning our mission
people clamoring
looks like its turning around
no its not its a course correction
its pretty standard
i was in the navy
nope its turning around
reporter seems to be
some confusion here amongst the crowd
but im not gonna lie to you
this reporter
is at a loss for words right now
its definitely turning around
im looking straight at it
drasks ship is definitely turning around
does anyone know
what the fuck just happened
its still locked
i just dont i dont understand
what couldve happened
i mean the mission was working right
everything was on track
yeah i mean
it couldve been anything uh
guidance system couldve malfunctioned
uh nuke destabilized myriad of things
who was that guy that walked into
the situation room he looked familiar
that was peter isherwell ceo of bash
and the third richest human ever
hes the guy that uh bought
the gutenberg bible and lost it
door opens
jason sorry to keep you waiting
things are uh extremely fluid
dr randall you are now the chief
science advisor to the white house
what
as such you need to attend
an emergency cabinet meeting
where you will be debriefed
what about us
you do not have clearance
for this sweetheart dont trip
got you some crackers some waters
you dont need to throw it on the floor
gonna be three four hours tops
here kate i dont know
why he threw em down here
what if we have to go to the bathroom
well lay out some newspaper for you
grab you a can of febreze
oglethorpe short sweet
and simple science
ill be back all right come on
oglethorpe
science tells the truth randall
sighs
fuck do you wanna come
yeah
orlean ladies and gentlemen
what we thought
what the world thought
was an impending and terrifying danger
turns out to be
an astonishing opportunity
our allies are very confused
and demanding answers
well tell em to wait
according to the most recent
spectrometer readings of comet dibiasky
made by the astrogeologists
at bash cellular
weve discovered something
something truly miraculous
peter peter
oh thank you janie
chuckles
as uh as some of you may know
the most valuable minerals in the world
are fast becoming those that are deployed
in the manufacture
of cell phones and uh computers
yttrium terbium osmium dysprosium
on and on and on
were running short
uh and the problem
is exacerbated of course
because china has her big panda paw
firmly on almost all the mines
that produce
these valuable rare earth assets
so you can imagine laughing
wow
just how happy we were at bash
when our astrogeologists discovered
and then determined that this comet
hurtling towards us from deep space
actually contains at least 32 trillion
of these critical materials
critical to technology
if were to proceed
im sorry is that why
you aborted this entire mission
is because youre trying to mine
the comet for rare minerals
orlean i think
we should hold all questions
until the end of the presentation
and you might find
that your questions are answered
yes madam president
when you
when the other metals are factored in
the comet actually contains
almost 140 trillion worth of assets
jason buckforty trilli
orlean yeah
laughter
what do these trillions of dollars
even matter if were all gonna die
woman i was about to ask
the same question janie
why werent we consulted
all due respect madam president
oh no what if were rich and were safe
kate ive gone over it
again and again and again in my head
and i still cant make sense of it
hes a threestar general
he works at the pentagon
why would he charge us for free snacks
one time i met sting
and i swear to god
he farted right in front of me
didnt break eye contact
and didnt even say excuse me
and the thing is
he actually pulled it off chuckles
cause i still found him
to be quite charming
whispering guys we have to talk
come on lets go come on now
its insane like completely insane
kate it will never work
i had the exact same reaction
this is a ninekilometerwide
planetkiller were talking about
not roaming charges
look i i was confused and outraged
that they turned this mission around too
but theyve got
gary talcamont from stanford
and lisa inez from princeton
on their team
i mean this is nextgeneration
cuttingedge technology
obviously one giant comet is a major
and existential uh threat to our planet
but 30 smaller meteoroids we can handle
our beads that stands for
bash uh explore and acquire drones
that you see here
attach themselves to the comet
and scan it with nanotechnology
developed by
nobel prizewinning scientist
dr gary talcamont
and then we immediately deploy dont we
nobel and polonsky prizewinning scientist
dr inezs microtargeted
quantum fission uh explosives
you see deep into the object
dr inez would you like
to explain whats happening
thank you peter
weve been developing
phasefission reactions
in the cern particle accelerator
that can splinter the comet
into smaller pieces
with breathtaking accuracy
these segments are then steered
and decelerated by each bead
into the pacific ocean for reclamation
by waiting us navy ships
and when these thank you
and when these treasures
from heaven are claimed
poverty as we know it
social injustice loss of biodiversity
all these multitudes of problems
are just gonna become relics of the past
and humanity is gonna stride through
the pillars of boaz and jachin naked
into the the glory of a golden age
and is this nanotech work peerreviewed
well i havent reviewed the data
but its been modeled
has any of this been peerreviewed
nope
interplanetary interstellar
intergalactic existence
for the human race
applause
orlean your mouth to gods ear
i understand the wealth
that they can extract from this comet
it can end world hunger
oglethorpe oh i see
kate laughing
why are you laughing
oglethorpe thats true no i see
so thats the pretty little bow theyre
putting around this line of bullshit
i bet theyll say freedom and puppies too
all right
yeah
you want me to quit the mission
ill quit the mission thats fine
but you have to understand
this is now beyond our control
they have all the power
so who do you want
in the actual room to make sure
this whole thing doesnt turn out to be
a complete goddamn disaster
jason orlean
you want jason orlean in that room huh
i have news for you
its already a complete disaster
theyre talking about letting
a comet the size of a mountain
hit the planet to jack up
a cell phone companys stock
you better take that down
about four or five notches now
were you yelling about that mission
why were you talking about cell phones
my friend was just theorizing
as to whats going on
were confused too
thats an awfully officiallooking
white house badge you got there
i dont know why i have this on
listen just tell us whats going on
i got three scared kids at home
just tell us something
i understand
i wish i could share information but
were people just like you
we deserve to know
theyre right
they deserve to know
do you really wanna know whats going on
woman yeah
man please
oglethorpe kate dont kate
mindy kate
they found a bunch of gold and diamonds
and rare shit on the comet
sighs
so theyre gonna let it hit the planet
to make a bunch of rich people
even more disgustingly rich
woman fuck you
people clamoring
people shouting and screaming
officer no camera
everything i could they wont listen
kate surprise surprise
now im starting to think
you just like riling people up
im so sorry kate really i am
kate oh randall god

laughter
are you at all concerned about
the sync on the bead explosions
oh doctor
there are always questions and fears and
i have a report here from a dr inez
if youd just take a look at this study
oh thanks
listen a lot of my colleagues
theyve either been removed
or resigned from this project
apparently for asking too many questions
about this mission here
so i just wanna make sure that youre
that youre open
to the scientific peerreview process
and youre not approaching
this mission like a businessman
you know that
what did you say
i wanna know if youre
did you call me a businessman
you do own a corporate
you think im just a businessman
do you think you know me doctor
business
this is evolution
this is evolution of the human species
what are you doing bringing this
orlean well
you know that bash has
over 40 million data points on you
on every decision you have made
since 1994 doctor
i i know when you have colon polyps
months before your doctor does
you got four or five
at the moment actually
you know theyre not of concern
but id have a checkup as soon as you can
but much more importantly than that
i know what you are i know who you are
my algorithms have determined
eight fundamental consumer profile types
you are a lifestyle idealist
you think youre motivated
by beliefs high ethical beliefs
but you just run towards pleasure
and away from pain
like a like a field mouse
mindy im just trying to
inhales deeply
i just wanna make sure
that the science is sound on this project
i hope you understand
our algorithms
can even predict how youll die
to 96 965 accuracy
i looked you up after we met
your death was so unremarkable and boring
i cant remember the details
apart from one thing
youre gonna die alone
alone
if youll excuse me madam president
ive got some work to do
orlean what the hell are you doing
my god
i was trying to do my job
you are just so lucky
that peter adores you
sighs
youre with the grownups now randall
i cant even follow this shit anymore
music playing on speakers
indistinct chatter
bash got orlean to pay
the chilean government if im correct
90 billion to let the tsunami
hit off the coast of the country
that sound right to you
man 3 isherwell built
an underground bunker
for him and all his executives
no i heard that
they built an escape ship
you guys
the truth is way more depressing
theyre not even smart enough to be
as evil as youre giving them credit for
glass shatters
people clamoring cheering
ugh
what
no
people shouting
fuck youre driving me fucking
crazy kate chuckles nervously
fuck it were all gonna die
sun ice cream
you smooth like felt
soft to the touch
you wear repellent
smell your scent from up above
angel getting carried out the club
for slapping harry
harrys just a mug
im stood outside waiting
where you gone
cubicle lines
catch a cold jack frost
jack movie will be released
the day that some believe
comet dibiasky will impact the planet
and the early word is
its already a classic brie
brie oh yes
well and what a stellar cast
devin yeah
i love devin peters
hes great everything he does
whats it called again
jack its called total devastation
it cost 300 million to make
brie whoo
i mean these movies
laughs its more than you earn
jack tell me about it
and my friend farley he saw it
he said its a ton of fun thats right
well farley likes it
all right well what farley says goes
but uh first
and yes you can tell from my smile
chuckles stop it
that americas sexiest scientist is here
dr randall welcome
dr randall how are you sir
sighs im im good
im gooder than good
laughter
all right so randall were hearing
that there is no comet
or that there is a comet but its
a good thing or maybe its a bad thing
we are so confused chuckles
so could you please help us out here
you know oh wise scientist
well first and foremost brie um
sniffs there most certainly
is a comet
brie all right
and we know that there is a comet
because we have the data
um clears throat
there has been growing concern within
the scientific community as of late
you see the peerreview process
is absolutely essential
if bashs stock
for us to get to the facts of yes
if bashs stock is any indicator
we dont have to worry
about the peer review
it is going gangbusters
and full disclosure
i bought as many shares as i could
i advise you to do the same
you are such a shameless capitalist
said the woman who will be
in the brandnew hot tub on my back deck
when i put it in from the stock
you know me too well
thats right
dr randall you sure youre okay
you want a glass of water
i dont feel so good
brie so i think well go
to commercial break
no please brie dont cut away
let me say something
okay
you came to the right place
we like to say things
would you please
just stop being so bleep pleasant
im sorry but not everything
needs to sound so goddamn clever
or charming or likeable all the time
sometimes we need to just be able
to say things to one another
we need to hear things
look lets establish once again
that there is a huge comet
headed towards earth
and the reason we know
that there is a comet
is because we saw it
we saw it with our own eyes
using a telescope
i mean for gods sake
we took a fucking picture of it
what other proof do we need
and if we cant all agree
at the bare minimum
that a giant comet
the size of mount everest
hurtling its way towards planet earth
is not a fucking good thing
then what the hell happened to us
i mean my god how do
how do we even talk to each other
whatve we whatve we done to ourselves
how do we fix it
we should have deflected this comet
when we had the fucking chance
but we didnt do it
i dont know why we didnt do it
and now theyre
actually firing scientists like me
for speaking out for opposing them
and im sure many of the people out there
arent even
gonna listen to what i just said
cause they have
their own political ideology
but i assure you
i am not on one side or the other
im just telling you the fucking truth
this would be a good time to establish
that isherwell and the president
have both said
that theres benefits to be
right well the president
of the united states is fucking lying
look im just like all of you
i hope to god i hope to god that
this president knows what shes doing
i hope shes got us all taken care of
but the truth is
i think this whole administration
has completely lost their fucking mind
and i think were all gonna die
breathing heavily
softly look i just wanna go home
sighs i just wanna go home
i just wanna go home more than anything
breathing heavily
but if there is one thing
one thing that i pray
that i pray that all of you hear
from what i have just said
is that all of us all of us
car door opens
sighs
whyd you do that
i really liked you
and i despise most people
mindy you know i
i really thought i loved you
really
wow
sighs thats wild
yeah
car door opens
man maam you need to go
we gotta get this man off the grid
mindy you still there

kate well maybe he just gets off
on the power you know
like any kind of power
its like he knew eventually that i was
gonna find out that the snacks were free
right
you know what i mean
yeah
so it was just like a power play
yeah guys are weird
im starting to think that all this
end of the world stuff is bullshit
its not
its definitely happening ive seen it
i feel like if god wanted to destroy
the earth he would destroy the earth
you believe in god
yeah i mean
my parents raised me evangelical
and i hate them
but i found my own way to it
my own relationship
kate hmm
id appreciate it
if you didnt advertise it though
i wont tell anybody chuckles
i think its kind of sweet

the united nations have been
considering its own deflective mission
laughing
just look up for fucks sake
woman now i know a lot of hollywood

one foot in front of the other
step by step
people cheering
orlean day by day
people chanting dont look up

captivating music playing
so we wanna say something loud and clear
there is no safe way
to bring this comet back to earth
and exploit it for profit
it cannot be done
nations of the world
defy orlean and bash
launch your own nuclear deflection mission
now and save this planet
breathing heavily

i feel your eyes
theyre locked on every part of me

true love doesnt die
it holds on tight
