and then she got herself blown up
and we got landed with you
blown up you told me
my parents died in a car crash

goodbye
see harry youre famous
but why am i famous
all those people
how is it they know who i am
im not sure im the right person
to tell you that
welcome harry to diagon alley
here you get your quills and ink
over there all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry
its a worldclass racing broom
look at it the new nimbus 2000
its the fastest model yet
but how am i to pay for all this
i havent any money
theres your money
gringotts the wizard bank
aint no safer place not one
except perhaps hogwarts
hagrid what exactly
are these things
theyre goblins clever as they come
but not the most friendly of beasts
best stay close
mr harry potter wishes
to make a withdrawal
and does mr harry potter
have his key
wait a minute
got it here somewhere
ha theres the little devil
and theres something else as well
professor dumbledore gave me this
its about youknowwhat
in vault youknowwhich
very well
vault 687
lamp please
key please
did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing
vault 713
whats in there hagrid
cant tell you
hogwarts business very secret
stand back
best not to mention this to anyone
i still need a wand
you want ollivanders
there aint no place better
run along there and wait
i got one more thing to do
hello
hello
i wondered when
id be seeing you mr potter
it seems only yesterday
that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands
here we are
give it a wave
apparently not
perhaps
this
no no definitely not
no matter
i wonder
curious
very curious
sorry but whats curious
i remember every wand
ive ever sold mr potter
it so happens that the phoenix
whose tail feather resides
in your wand gave another feather
just one other
it is curious that you should
be destined for this wand
when its brother
gave you that scar
and who owned that wand
we do not speak his name
the wand chooses
the wizard mr potter
its not always clear why
but i think it is clear
that we can expect
great things from you
after all hewhomustnotbenamed
did great things
terrible
yes but great
harry harry
happy birthday
you all right harry
you seem very quiet
he killed my parents didnt he
the one who gave me this
you know hagrid i know you do
first and understand this
because its very important
not all wizards are good
some of them go bad
a few years ago
there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go his name was v
his name was v
maybe if you wrote it down
no i cant spell it
all right voldemort
voldemort
it was dark times harry
voldemort started
to gather some followers
brought them over to the dark side
anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead
your parents fought against him
but nobody lived once
he decided to kill them
nobody not one
except you
me voldemort tried to kill me
yes that aint no ordinary cut
on your forehead harry
a mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse an evil curse
what happened to v
to youknowwho
well some say he died
codswallop in my opinion
nope i reckon hes out there still
too tired to carry on
but one things certain something
about you stumped him that night

to say a few words
i have a few startofterm notices
i wish to announce
the first years please note
that the dark forest is
strictly forbidden to all students

has asked me to remind you
that the thirdfloor corridor
is out of bounds
to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death
thank you
when i call your name

i shall place the sorting hat
on your head

to greatness no doubt about that

me dads a muggle mums a witch
bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out
percy whos that teacher
talking to professor quirrell
professor snape
head of slytherin house
whats he teach
potions
but he fancies the dark arts
hes been after quirrells job for years
hello how are you
welcome to gryffindor
its the bloody baron
hello sir nicholas
have a nice summer
dismal once again my request to join
the headless hunt has been denied

i prefer sir nicholas
if you dont mind
nearly headless
how can you be nearly headless
like this
gryffindors follow me please

welcome to the gryffindor common room
boys dormitory is upstairs to the left
girls the same on your right
your belongings have
already been brought up

can you imagine the look on old
mcgonagalls face if we were late
that was bloody brilliant
thank you for that assessment
itd be better if i transfigured
mr potter and you into a watch
then one of you might be on time
we got lost
then perhaps a map i trust you
dont need one to find your seats
there will be no foolish wandwaving
or silly incantations in this class
as such i dont expect
many of you to appreciate
the subtle science and exact art
that is potionmaking
however for those select few
who possess the predisposition
i can teach you
how to bewitch the mind
and ensnare the senses
i can tell you how to bottle fame
brew glory and even
put a stopper in death
then again maybe some of you have
come to hogwarts with abilities
so formidable that
you feel confident enough
to not pay attention
mr potter
our new celebrity
what would i get if i added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood
you dont know lets try again
where would you look
if i asked you to find a bezoar
i dont know sir
what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane
i dont know sir
pity
clearly fame isnt everything
is it mr potter
eye of rabbit harp string hum

gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken

keep your feet on the ground
while i take him to the hospital wing

a single broom in the air
the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say quidditch
did you see his face
if he had squeezed this hed have
remembered to fall on his arse
give it here malfoy
no ill leave it somewhere
for longbottom to find
how about on the roof
whats the matter potter
bit beyond your reach
harry no way
you heard what madam hooch said
besides you dont know how to fly
what an idiot

knock you off your broom
is that so
have it your way then
nice going harry
that was wicked harry
harry potter
follow me
you wait here
professor quirrell excuse me
could i borrow wood for a moment
yes of course
potter this is oliver wood
wood i have found you a seeker
have you heard harry potters
the new gryffindor seeker
i always knew hed do well
seeker but first years
never make the house teams
you must be the youngest player in
a century mcgonagall says
well done harry
woods just told us
fred and george are on the team
beaters
our job is to make sure you
dont get bloodied up too bad
cant make any promises
rough game quidditch
but no ones died in years
someone vanishes occasionally
but theyll turn up in a month or two
go on quidditch is great best game
there is and youll be great too
ive never played
what if i make a fool of myself
you wont make a fool of yourself
its in your blood
you never told me your father
was a seeker too
i didnt know
im telling you its spooky
she knows more about you than you do
who doesnt
whats happening
the staircases change remember
lets go this way
before the staircase moves again
does anybody feel like
we shouldnt be here
were not supposed to be here
this is the third floor
its forbidden
lets go
its filchs cat
run
quick lets hide through that door
its locked
were done for
move over
alohomora
get in
alohomora
standard book of spells
chapter seven
anyone here my sweet
come on
filch is gone
he thinks this doors locked
it was locked
and for good reason
what are they doing keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school
didnt you see what
it was standing on
i wasnt looking at its feet
i was preoccupied with its heads
or maybe you didnt notice
there were three
it was standing on a trap door
it wasnt there by accident
its guarding something
guarding something
thats right now if you two dont mind
im going to bed
before you come up with another idea
to get us killed
or worse expelled
she needs to sort out her priorities
quidditch is easy to understand
each team has seven players
three chasers two beaters
one keeper and a seeker thats you
there are three kinds of balls
this ones called the quaffle
the chasers handle the quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops
the keeper thats me
defends the hoops with me so far
i think so what are those
you better take this
careful now its coming back
not bad potter
youd make a fair beater
what was that
bludger nasty little buggers
but you are a seeker
the only thing i want you
to worry about is this
the golden snitch
i like this ball
you like it now
just wait its wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see
what do i do with it
you catch it
before the other teams seeker
you catch this the games over
you catch this potter
and we win
one of a wizards most rudimentary
skills is levitation
or the ability to make objects fly
do you have your feathers good
now dont forget the nice wrist
movement weve been practicing
the swish and flick everyone
the swish and flick good
oh and enunciate
wingardium leviosa
off you go then
wingardium leviosa
wingardium leviosa
no stop stop stop youre going
to take someones eye out
besides youre saying it wrong
its leviosa not leviosar
you do it then if youre so clever
go on go on
wingardium leviosa
well done see here everyone
miss grangers done it
splendid
well done dear
i think were going to need
another feather over here
its leviosa not leviosar
shes a nightmare honestly
no wonder she hasnt got any friends
i think she heard you
wheres hermione
parvati said she wouldnt
come out of the bathroom
she said that shed been in there
all afternoon crying
troll in the dungeon
troll in the dungeon
thought you ought to know
silence
everyone will please not panic
now
prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories
teachers will follow me
to the dungeons
gryffindors keep up please
and stay alert
how could a troll get in
not on its own trolls are really stupid
probably people playing jokes
what
hermione she doesnt know
i think the trolls left the dungeon
its going into the girls bathroom
hermione move
help help
hey pea brain
help
do something
what
anything
hurry up
swish and flick
wingardium leviosa
cool
is it dead
i dont think so just knocked out
troll boogers
oh my goodness
explain yourselves both of you
well what it is
its my fault professor mcgonagall
miss granger
i went looking for the troll
i thought i could handle it
but i was wrong
if harry and ron hadnt come
and found me id probably be dead
be that as it may it was
an extremely foolish thing to do
i expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you
five points will be taken
from gryffindor
for your serious lack of judgment
as for you two gentlemen
i just hope you realize
how fortunate you are
not many firstyear students
could take on a troll
and live to tell the tale
five points
will be awarded to each of you
for sheer dumb luck
perhaps you ought to go
it might wake up
take a bit of toast mate go on
rons right
youll need your strength today
im not hungry
good luck today potter
youve proven yourself against a troll
a game of quidditch
should be easy work
even if it is against slytherin
that explains the blood
blood
last night im guessing snape let
the troll in as a diversion
so he could get past that dog
but he got bit
thats why hes limping
but why would anyone go near that dog
at gringotts hagrid took
something out of the vault
said it was hogwarts business
very secret
youre saying
thats what the dogs guarding
thats what snape wants
bit early for mail isnt it
but i never get mail
lets open it
its a broomstick
thats not just a broomstick
its a nimbus 2000
but who
scared harry
a little
its all right i felt the same way
before my first game
what happened
i dont really remember
i took a bludger to the head
two minutes in
woke up in hospital a week later
welcome to hogwarts first
quidditch game of the season
todays game
slytherin versus gryffindor
the players take their positions
as madam hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game
now i want a nice clean game
from all of you
the bludgers are up
followed by the golden snitch
remember the snitch
is worth 150 points
the seeker who catches the snitch
ends the game
the quaffle is released
and the game begins
angelina johnson scores
ten points for gryffindor
well done
slytherin takes the quaffle
bletchley passes to captain marcus flint
another 10 points to gryffindor
give me that
take that side
whats going on
with harrys broomstick
its snape
hes jinxing the broom
jinxing the broom what do we do
leave it to me
come on hermione
lacarnum inflamarae
fire youre on fire
go go go go
looks like hes gonna be sick
hes got the snitch
harry potter receives 150 points
for catching the snitch
gryffindor wins
nonsense why would snape
put a curse on harrys broom
who knows why was he trying
to get past that threeheaded dog
who told you about fluffy
fluffy
that thing has a name
of course he has a name hes mine
i bought him off an irishman
i lent him to dumbledore to guard
shouldnt have said that
no more questions thats topsecret
but whatever fluffys guarding
snapes trying to steal it
codswallop professor snape
is a hogwarts teacher
teacher or not i know a spell when
i see one ive read all about them
youve got to keep eye contact
and snape wasnt blinking
exactly
now you listen to me
all three of you
youre meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in its dangerous
what that dog is guarding is
between dumbledore and nicholas flamel
nicholas flamel
i shouldnt have said that
i should not have said that
nicholas flamel
whos nicholas flamel
i dont know
merry christmas
merry christmas

whatever we want
yes and no
it shows us nothing more or less
than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts
now you harry who have
never known your family
you see them standing beside you
but remember this harry
this mirror gives us
neither knowledge
or truth
men have wasted away in front of it
even gone mad
that is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home
and i must ask you
not to go looking for it again
it does not do to dwell on dreams
and forget to live
i had you looking in the wrong section
how could i be so stupid
i checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading
this is light
of course here it is
nicholas flamel is the only known
maker of the philosophers stone
the what
honestly dont you two read
the philosophers stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers
itll transform any metal
into pure gold
and produces the elixir of life
which will make the drinker immortal
immortal
it means youll never die
i know what it means
the only stone currently in existence
belongs to mr nicholas flamel
the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday
thats what fluffys guarding
thats whats under the trap door
the philosophers stone
dont wish to be rude
but im in no state to entertain
we know about the philosophers stone
we think snapes trying to steal it
are you still on about him
we know hes after it
we dont know why
snape is one of the teachers
protecting the stone he wont steal it
what
you heard come on
im a bit preoccupied today
wait a minute
one of the teachers
there are other things
defending the stone arent there
spells enchantments
right
waste of bloody time if you ask me
aint no one gonna get past fluffy
aint a soul knows how
except for me and dumbledore
i shouldnt have told you that
i should not have told you that
hagrid what exactly is that
that its
i know what that is
but hagrid how did you get one
i won it off a stranger
i met down at the pub
seemed quite glad to be rid of it
as a matter of fact
is that
a dragon
thats not just a dragon
thats a norwegian ridgeback
my brother works
with these in romania
isnt he beautiful oh bless him
look he knows his mummy
hello norbert
norbert
hes gotta have a name dont he
dont you norbert
hell have to be trained up a bit
of course
whos that
malfoy
oh dear
hagrid always wanted a dragon
told me so the first time i met him
its crazy
and worse malfoy knows
i dont understand is that bad
its bad
good evening
nothing i repeat nothing
gives a student the right
to walk about at night
therefore as punishment for your actions
50 points will be taken
50
each
to ensure it doesnt happen again
all four of you
will receive detention
excuse me professor
perhaps i heard you wrong
i thought you said the four of us
no you heard me correctly
honorable as your intentions were
you too were out of bed after hours
you will join your classmates
in detention
a pity they let
the old punishments die
was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons
god i miss the screaming
youll be serving detention
with hagrid tonight
hes got a little job to do
inside the dark forest
a sorry lot this hagrid
good god youre not still on
about that bloody dragon are you
norberts gone
dumbledore sent him off to romania
to live in a colony
thats good isnt it
hes with his own kind
what if he dont like romania
what if the other dragons are mean
to him hes only a baby
for gods sake pull yourself together
youre going into the forest
got to have your wits about you
the forest i thought that was a joke
we cant go in there
students arent allowed
and there are
werewolves
theres more than werewolves
in those trees
you can be sure of that
nightynight
right lets go
hagrid what is that
what were here for
see that
thats unicorn blood that is
i found one dead a few weeks ago
now this ones been hurt bad
by something
so its our job to go
and find the poor beast
ron hermione come with me
and harry youll go with malfoy
okay then i get fang
fine just so you know
hes a bloody coward
wait till my father hears about this
this is servants stuff
if i didnt know better
id say you were scared
im not scared potter
do you hear that
come on fang
scared
what is it fang
harry potter you must leave
you are known to many creatures here
the forest is not safe at this time
especially for you
what was that thing you saved me from
a monstrous creature
it is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn
drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death
but at a terrible price for you
have slain something so pure
that the moment the blood touches
your lips you will have a halflife
a cursed life
who would choose such a life
can you think of no one
do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn
that was drinking its blood
that was voldemort
do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment
the philosophers stone
harry
hello there firenze
see youve met our young mr potter
you all right there harry
harry potter
this is where i leave you
youre safe now good luck
you mean youknowwho is out there
right now in the forest
but hes weak
hes living off the unicorns
dont you see we had it wrong
snape doesnt want the stone for himself
he wants it for voldemort
with the elixir of life
voldemort will be strong again
hell come back
but if he comes back
you dont think hell try
to kill you do you
if hed had the chance
he might have tried tonight
and to think ive been worrying
about my potions final
hang on a minute
were forgetting one thing
whos the one wizard
voldemort always feared
dumbledore as long as dumbledore
is around harry youre safe
as long as dumbledore is around
you cant be touched
id heard hogwarts final exams were
frightful but i found that enjoyable
speak for yourself
all right there harry
my scar it keeps burning
its happened before
not like this
you should see the nurse
i think its a warning
it means dangers coming
of course
what is it
isnt it odd that what hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon
and a stranger just happens
to have one
how many people wander around
with dragon eggs
why didnt i see it before
who gave you the egg
what did he look like
i never saw his face
he kept his hood up
you and this stranger
must have talked
he wanted to know what sort
of creatures i looked after
i said after fluffy
a dragons gonna be no problem
was he interested in fluffy
of course he was interested
how often do you come across
a threeheaded dog
but i told him the trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him
take fluffy for example play him
music and he falls straight to sleep
i shouldnt have told you that
where are you going
we have to see dumbledore
immediately
im afraid hes not here
he received an urgent owl
from the ministry of magic and left
hes gone
but this is important
this is about the philosophers stone
how do you know
someones going to try and steal it
i dont know how you know
but i assure you it is well protected
now would you go back
to your dormitories quietly
that was no stranger hagrid met
it was snape
which means he knows
how to get past fluffy
and with dumbledore gone
good afternoon
what would three young gryffindors
be doing inside on a day like this
we were just
you ought to be careful
people will think youre
up to something
now what do we do
we go down the trap door tonight
trevor
trevor go you shouldnt be here
neither should you
youre sneaking out again arent you
neville listen we were
no i wont let you
youll get gryffindor into trouble again
ill fight you
neville im really sorry about this
petrificus totalus
youre a little scary sometimes
you know that
brilliant but scary
lets go
sorry
its for your own good you know
you stood on my foot
sorry
alohomora
wait a minute hes
snoring
snapes already been here
hes put a spell on the harp
its got horrible breath
we have to move its paw
what
come on

ill go first dont follow
until i give you a sign
if something bad happens
get yourselves out
does it seem a bit quiet to you
the harp
its stopped playing
jump
lucky this plant things here really
stop moving both of you
this is devils snare
you have to relax if you dont
it will only kill you faster

oh now i can relax
hermione

just relax
hermione where are you
do what i say trust me

i remember reading something
in herbology
devils snare devils snare
its deadly fun
but will sulk in the sun
thats it it hates sunlight
lumus solem
ron you okay
yeah
lucky we didnt panic
lucky hermione pays attention
in herbology
what is that
i dont know sounds like wings
curious ive never seen
birds like these
theyre not birds
theyre keys
and ill bet one of them
fits that door
whats this all about
i dont know
strange
alohomora
well it was worth a try
what will we do
there must be a thousand keys
we want a big oldfashioned one
probably rusty
i see it
the one with the broken wing
whats wrong
its too simple
go on if snape could catch it
on that old broomstick you can
youre the youngest seeker
in a century
this complicates things a bit
catch the key
hurry up
i dont like this
i dont like this at all
where are we a graveyard
this is no graveyard
its a chessboard
theres the door
now what do we do
its obvious isnt it weve got
to play our way across the room
harry you take
the empty bishops square
hermione youll be
the queenside castle
as for me ill be a knight
what happens now
well white moves first
and then
we play
ron you dont suppose
this is going to be like
real wizards chess do you
you there d5
yes hermione
i think this is gonna be
exactly like wizards chess
castle to e4
pawn to c3
wait a minute
you understand right harry
once i make my move
the queen will take me
then youre free to check the king
no ron no
what is it
hes going to sacrifice himself
no there must be another way
do you wanna stop snape
from getting that stone or not
harry its you that has to go on
i know it
not me not hermione you
knight to h3
check
ron
no dont move
dont forget were still playing
checkmate
take care of ron
then go to the owlery
send a message to dumbledore
rons right
i have to go on
youll be okay harry
youre a great wizard you really are
not as good as you
me books and cleverness
there are more important things
friendship and bravery
and harry just be careful
you
no it cant be
snape he was the
yes he does seem the type
doesnt he
next to him who would suspect
poor stuttering
professor quirrell
but that day during the quidditch match
snape tried to kill me
no dear boy i tried to kill you
if snapes cloak hadnt caught
fire and broken my eye contact
i would have succeeded
even with snape muttering
his countercurse
snape was trying to save me
i knew you were a danger to me
especially after halloween
then you let the troll in
very good potter yes
snape unfortunately wasnt fooled
while everyone ran about
he went to the third floor to head me off
he of course never trusted me again
he rarely left me alone
but he doesnt understand
im never alone never
now what does this mirror do
i see what i desire
i see myself holding the stone
but how do i get it
use the boy
come here potter now
tell me what do you see
what is it what do you see
im shaking hands with dumbledore
ive won the house cup
he lies
tell the truth what do you see
let me speak to him
master you are not strong enough
i have strength enough for this
harry potter
we meet again
voldemort
yes you see what ive become
see what i must do to survive
live off another a mere parasite
unicorn blood can sustain me
but it cannot give me
a body of my own
but there is something that can
something that conveniently enough
lies in your pocket
stop him
dont be a fool
why suffer an horrific death
when you can join me and live
never
bravery your parents had it too
tell me harry
would you like to see
your mother and father again
together
we can bring them back
all i ask is for something in return
thats it harry
there is no good and evil
there is only power
and those too weak to seek it
together well do
extraordinary things
just give me the stone
you liar
kill him
what is this magic
fool get the stone
good afternoon harry
tokens from your admirers
admirers
what happened in the dungeons between
you and professor quirrell is a secret
so naturally the whole school knows
i see that your friend ronald
has saved you the trouble
of opening your chocolate frogs
ron was here is he all right
what about hermione
fine theyre both just fine
what happened to the stone
relax dear boy
the stone has been destroyed
my friend nicholas and i
have had a little chat
and agreed it was best all around
but then flamel
hell die wont he
he has enough elixir
to set his affairs in order
but yes he will die
how is it i got the stone sir
one minute i was staring
in the mirror and
you see only a person
who wanted to find the stone
find it
but not use it
would be able to get it
that is one of my more brilliant ideas
and between you and me
that is saying something
does that mean with the stone gone
that voldemort can never come back
im afraid
there are ways
in which he can return
harry do you know why
professor quirrell couldnt bear
to have you touch him
it was because of your mother
she sacrificed herself for you
and that kind of act leaves a mark
no this kind of mark cannot be seen
it lives in your very skin
what is it
love harry love
bertie botts every flavor beans
i was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomitflavored one
and since then
ive lost my liking for them
but i think i could be safe
with a nice toffee
alas
earwax
all right there ron
all right you
all right hermione
never better
another year gone
and now as i understand it
the house cup needs awarding
and the points stand thus
in fourth place
gryffindor with 312 points
third place
hufflepuff with 352 points
in second place
ravenclaw with 426 points
and in first place
with 472 points slytherin house
nice one mate
yes well done slytherin
well done
however recent events must
be taken into account
and i have a few lastminute points
to award
to miss hermione granger
for the cool use of intellect
while others were in grave peril
50 points
good job
second to mr ronald weasley
for the bestplayed game of chess
that hogwarts has seen
these many years 50 points
and third
to mr harry potter
for pure nerve
and outstanding courage
i award gryffindor house 60 points
were tied with slytherin
finally it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies
but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends
i award 10 points
to neville longbottom
assuming that my calculations
are correct
i believe that a change
of decoration is in order
gryffindor wins the house cup
come on now
hurry up youll be late
trains leaving go on
come on hurry up
come on harry
one minute
thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye did you
this is for you
thanks hagrid
go on on with you on with you now
oh listen harry
if that dolt of a cousin of yours
dudley gives you any grief
you could always threaten him
with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail
but were not allowed to do magic
away from hogwarts you know that
