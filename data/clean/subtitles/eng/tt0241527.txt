how could you not be 
my perfect sister being who she was 
my mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter 
 we have a witch in the family 
isn t it wonderful  
i was the only one to see her
for what she was 
a freak 
then she met that potter 
and then she had you   
   and i knew you would be the same 
just as strange  just as abnormal 
and then she got herself blown up 
and we got landed with you 
blown up  you told me
my parents died in a car crash

his name down since he were born 
he s going to the finest school

   in front of me 
i d appreciate it if you didn t tell
anyone at hogwarts about that 
  i m not allowed to do magic 
  okay 
we re a bit behind schedule 
best be off 
unless you d rather stay  of course 
 all students must be equipped with   
   one standard size 2
pewter cauldron   
   and may bring  if they desire 
either an owl  a cat or a toad  
can we find all this in london 
if you know where to go 
ah  hagrid  the usual  i presume 
no  thanks  tom 
i m on official hogwarts business 
just helping harry buy
his school supplies 
bless my soul 
it s harry potter 
welcome back  mr  potter 
welcome back 
doris crockford  i can t believe
i m meeting you at last 
harry potter  can t tell you
how pleased i am to meet you 
hello  professor  i didn t see you 
professor quirrell will be your
defense against the dark arts teacher 
oh  nice to meet you 
fearfully fascinating subject 
not that you need it  eh  potter 
yes  well  must be going now 
lots to buy 
goodbye 
  see  harry  you re famous 
  but why am i famous 
all those people 
how is it they know who i am 
i m not sure i m the right person
to tell you that 
welcome  harry  to diagon alley 
here  you get your quills and ink 
over there  all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry 
it s a world class racing broom 
look at it  the new nimbus 2000 
it s the fastest model yet 
but how am i to pay for all this 
i haven t any money 
there s your money 
gringotts  the wizard bank 
ain t no safer place  not one 
except perhaps hogwarts 
hagrid  what exactly
are these things 
they re goblins  clever as they come 
but not the most friendly of beasts 
best stay close 
mr  harry potter wishes
to make a withdrawal 
and does mr  harry potter
have his key 
wait a minute 
got it here somewhere 
ha  there s the little devil 
and there s something else as well 
professor dumbledore gave me this 
it s about you know what
in vault you know which 
very well 
vault 687 
lamp  please 
key  please 
did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing 
  vault 713 
  what s in there  hagrid 
can t tell you 
hogwarts business  very secret 
stand back 
best not to mention this to anyone 
i still need a wand 
you want ollivanders 
there ain t no place better 
run along there and wait 
i got one more thing to do 
hello 
hello 
i wondered when
i d be seeing you  mr  potter 
it seems only yesterday   
   that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands 
here we are 
give it a wave 
apparently not 
perhaps   
   this 
no  no  definitely not 
no matter 
i wonder   
curious 
very curious 
sorry  but what s curious 
i remember every wand
i ve ever sold  mr  potter 
it so happens that the phoenix   
   whose tail feather resides
in your wand  gave another feather 
just one other 
it is curious that you should
be destined for this wand   
   when its brother
gave you that scar 
and who owned that wand 
we do not speak his name 
the wand chooses
the wizard  mr  potter 
it s not always clear why 
but i think it is clear   
   that we can expect
great things from you 
after all  he who must not be named   
   did great things 
terrible   
   yes  but great 
harry  harry 
happy birthday 
you all right  harry 
you seem very quiet 
he killed my parents  didn t he 
the one who gave me this 
you know  hagrid  i know you do 
first  and understand this
because it s very important 
not all wizards are good 
some of them go bad 
a few years ago   
   there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go  his name was v   
  his name was v   
  maybe if you wrote it down 
no  i can t spell it 
  all right  voldemort 
  voldemort 
it was dark times  harry 
voldemort started
to gather some followers 
brought them over to the dark side 
anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead 
your parents fought against him 
but nobody lived once
he decided to kill them 
nobody  not one 
except you 
me  voldemort tried to kill me 
yes  that ain t no ordinary cut
on your forehead  harry 
a mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse  an evil curse 
what happened to v 
to you know who 
well  some say he died 
codswallop  in my opinion 
nope  i reckon he s out there still   
   too tired to carry on 
but one thing s certain  something
about you stumped him that night 
that s why you re famous 
that s why everybody knows your name 
you re the boy who lived 
what are you looking at 
blimey  is that the time 
i m gonna have to leave you 
dumbledore will be wanting his   
well  he ll be wanting to see me 
your train leaves in 10 minutes 
here s your ticket  stick to your ticket 
that s very important

the first years  please note   
   that the dark forest is
strictly forbidden to all students 
also  our caretaker  mr  filch 
has asked me to remind you   
   that the third floor corridor
is out of bounds   
   to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death 
thank you 
when i call your name 
you will come forth

into your houses 
hermione granger

but where to put you 
not slytherin  not slytherin

   gryffindor 
your attention  please 
let the feast begin 
i m half and half 
me dad s a muggle  mum s a witch 
bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out 
percy  who s that teacher
talking to professor quirrell 
professor snape 
head of slytherin house 
  what s he teach 
  potions 
but he fancies the dark arts 
he s been after quirrell s job for years 
hello  how are you 
welcome to gryffindor 
it s the bloody baron 
hello  sir nicholas 
have a nice summer 
dismal  once again  my request to join
the headless hunt has been denied 
i know you 
you re nearly headless nick 
i prefer sir nicholas 
if you don t mind 
 nearly  headless 
how can you be nearly headless 
like this 
gryffindors  follow me  please 
keep up  thank you 
ravenclaw  follow me  this way 
this is the most direct path
to the dormitories 
keep an eye on the staircases 
they like to change 
keep up  please  and follow me 
quickly now  come on  come on 
that picture s moving 
  look at that one 
  i think she fancies you 
  look 
  who s that girl 
welcome to hogwarts 
password 
caput draconis 
follow me  everyone  keep up 
quickly  come on 
gather around here 
welcome to the gryffindor common room 
boys  dormitory is upstairs to the left 
girls  the same on your right 
your belongings have
already been brought up 
made it 
can you imagine the look on old
mcgonagall s face if we were late 
  that was bloody brilliant 
  thank you for that assessment 
it d be better if i transfigured
mr  potter and you into a watch 
  then one of you might be on time 
  we got lost 
then perhaps a map  i trust you
don t need one to find your seats 
there will be no foolish wand waving
or silly incantations in this class 
as such  i don t expect
many of you to appreciate   
   the subtle science and exact art
that is potion making 
however  for those select few   
   who possess the predisposition   
   i can teach you
how to bewitch the mind   
   and ensnare the senses 
i can tell you how to bottle fame   
   brew glory and even
put a stopper in death 
then again  maybe some of you have
come to hogwarts with abilities   
   so formidable that
you feel confident enough   
   to not pay attention 
mr  potter 
our new celebrity 
what would i get if i added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood 
you don t know  let s try again 
where would you look
if i asked you to find a bezoar 
i don t know  sir 
what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane 
i don t know  sir 
pity 
clearly  fame isn t everything   
   is it  mr  potter 
eye of rabbit  harp string hum
turn this water into rum
eye of rabbit   
what s seamus trying to do
to the water 
turn it to rum  actually managed
a weak tea yesterday  before   
mail s here 
can i borrow this  thanks 
look  neville s got a remembrall 
i ve read about those  the smoke turns
red when you ve forgotten something 
the problem is  i can t remember
what i ve forgotten 
somebody broke into gringotts  listen 
 believed to be the work
of dark wizards or witches   
   gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken 
the vault in question  number 713 
had been emptied earlier that same day  
that s odd  that s the vault
hagrid and i went to 
  good afternoon  class 
  good afternoon  madam hooch 
good afternoon  amanda 
good afternoon 
welcome to your first flying lesson 
what are you waiting for 
step up to your broomstick 
come on now  hurry up  stick your hand
over the broom and say   up

up 
up  up 
with feeling 
shut up  harry 
now  once you ve got hold of
your broom  i want you to mount it 
grip it tight  you don t wanna be
sliding off the end 
when i blow my whistle  i want you
to kick off from the ground  hard 
keep your broom steady 
hover for a moment   
   then lean forward slightly
and touch back down 
on my whistle  three  two   
mr  longbottom 
  mr  longbottom 
  down  down 
neville 
come back down this instant 
everyone out of the way 
is he all right 
oh  dear  it s a broken wrist 
poor boy  come on now  up you get 
keep your feet on the ground
while i take him to the hospital wing 
understand  if i see
a single broom in the air   
   the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say quidditch 
did you see his face 
if he had squeezed this  he d have
remembered to fall on his arse 
give it here  malfoy 
no  i ll leave it somewhere
for longbottom to find 
how about on the roof 
what s the matter  potter 
bit beyond your reach 
harry  no way 
you heard what madam hooch said 
besides  you don t know how to fly 
what an idiot 
give it here or i ll
knock you off your broom 
is that so 
have it your way  then 
  nice going  harry 
  that was wicked  harry 
harry potter 
follow me 
you wait here 
professor quirrell  excuse me 
could i borrow wood for a moment 
yes  of course 
potter  this is oliver wood 
wood  i have found you a seeker 
have you heard  harry potter s
the new gryffindor seeker 
i always knew he d do well 
seeker  but first years
never make the house teams 
  you must be the youngest player in   
  a century  mcgonagall says 
well done  harry 
wood s just told us 
fred and george are on the team 
beaters 
our job is to make sure you
don t get bloodied up too bad 
can t make any promises 
rough game  quidditch 
but no one s died in years 
someone vanishes occasionally 
but they ll turn up in a month or two 
go on  quidditch is great  best game
there is  and you ll be great too 
i ve never played 
what if i make a fool of myself 
you won t make a fool of yourself 
it s in your blood 
you never told me your father
was a seeker too 
i didn t know 
i m telling you  it s spooky 
she knows more about you than you do 
who doesn t 
what s happening 
the staircases change  remember 
  let s go this way 
  before the staircase moves again 
does anybody feel like
we shouldn t be here 
we re not supposed to be here 
this is the third floor 
it s forbidden 
let s go 
  it s filch s cat 
  run 
quick  let s hide through that door 
  it s locked 
  we re done for 
move over 
alohomora 
get in 
alohomora 
standard book of spells 
chapter seven 
anyone here  my sweet 
come on 
  filch is gone 
  he thinks this door s locked 
  it was locked 
  and for good reason 
what are they doing  keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school 
didn t you see what
it was standing on 
i wasn t looking at its feet 
i was preoccupied with its heads 
or maybe you didn t notice 
there were three 
it was standing on a trap door 
it wasn t there by accident 
  it s guarding something 
  guarding something 
that s right  now  if you two don t mind 
i m going to bed   
   before you come up with another idea
to get us killed 
or worse  expelled 
she needs to sort out her priorities 
quidditch is easy to understand 
each team has seven players 
three chasers  two beaters 
one keeper and a seeker  that s you 
there are three kinds of balls 
this one s called the quaffle 
the chasers handle the quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops 
the keeper  that s me 
defends the hoops  with me so far 
i think so  what are those 
you better take this 
careful now  it s coming back 
not bad  potter 
you d make a fair beater 
what was that 
bludger  nasty little buggers 
but you are a seeker 
the only thing i want you
to worry about is this 
the golden snitch 
  i like this ball 
  you like it now 
just wait  it s wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see 
what do i do with it 
you catch it 
before the other team s seeker 
you catch this  the game s over 
you catch this  potter 
and we win 
one of a wizard s most rudimentary
skills is levitation   
   or the ability to make objects fly 
do you have your feathers  good 
now  don t forget the nice wrist
movement we ve been practicing 
the swish and flick  everyone 
the swish and flick  good 
oh  and enunciate 
wingardium leviosa 
off you go  then 
wingardium leviosa 
wingardium leviosa 
no  stop  stop  stop  you re going
to take someone s eye out 
besides  you re saying it wrong 
it s leviosa  not leviosar 
you do it then  if you re so clever 
go on  go on 
wingardium leviosa 
well done  see here  everyone 
miss granger s done it 
splendid 
well done  dear 
i think we re going to need
another feather over here 
 it s leviosa  not leviosar  
she s a nightmare  honestly 
no wonder she hasn t got any friends 
i think she heard you 
where s hermione 
parvati said she wouldn t
come out of the bathroom 
she said that she d been in there
all afternoon  crying 
troll in the dungeon 
troll in the dungeon 
thought you ought to know 
silence 
everyone will please not panic 
now   
   prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories 
teachers will follow me
to the dungeons 
gryffindors  keep up  please 
and stay alert 
how could a troll get in 
not on its own  trolls are really stupid 
probably people playing jokes 
  what 
  hermione  she doesn t know 
i think the troll s left the dungeon 
it s going into the girls  bathroom 
hermione  move 
help  help 
hey  pea brain 
help 
do something 
  what 
  anything 
  hurry up 
  swish and flick 
wingardium leviosa 
cool 
is it dead 
i don t think so  just knocked out 
troll boogers 
oh  my goodness 
explain yourselves  both of you 
  well  what it is   
  it s my fault  professor mcgonagall 
miss granger 
i went looking for the troll 
i thought i could handle it 
but i was wrong 
if harry and ron hadn t come
and found me  i d probably be dead 
be that as it may  it was
an extremely foolish thing to do 
i expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you 
five points will be taken
from gryffindor   
   for your serious lack of judgment 
as for you two gentlemen   
   i just hope you realize
how fortunate you are 
not many first year students
could take on a troll   
   and live to tell the tale 
five points   
   will be awarded to each of you   
   for sheer dumb luck 
perhaps you ought to go 
it might wake up 
take a bit of toast  mate  go on 
ron s right 
you ll need your strength today 
i m not hungry 
good luck today  potter 
you ve proven yourself against a troll 
a game of quidditch
should be easy work 
even if it is against slytherin 
  that explains the blood 
  blood 
last night  i m guessing snape let
the troll in as a diversion   
   so he could get past that dog 
but he got bit 
that s why he s limping 
but why would anyone go near that dog 
at gringotts  hagrid took
something out of the vault 
said it was hogwarts business 
very secret 
you re saying   
that s what the dog s guarding 
that s what snape wants 
  bit early for mail  isn t it 
  but i never get mail 
let s open it 
it s a broomstick 
that s not just a broomstick 
it s a nimbus 2000 
but who 
  scared  harry 
  a little 
it s all right  i felt the same way
before my first game 
  what happened 
  i don t really remember 
i took a bludger to the head
two minutes in 
woke up in hospital a week later 
welcome to hogwarts  first
quidditch game of the season 
today s game 
slytherin versus gryffindor 
the players take their positions   
   as madam hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game 
now  i want a nice  clean game   
   from all of you 
the bludgers are up 
followed by the golden snitch 
remember  the snitch
is worth 150 points 
the seeker who catches the snitch
ends the game 
the quaffle is released
and the game begins 
angelina johnson scores 
ten points for gryffindor 
well done 
slytherin takes the quaffle 
bletchley passes to captain marcus flint 
another 10 points to gryffindor 
give me that 
take that side 
what s going on
with harry s broomstick 
it s snape 
he s jinxing the broom 
  jinxing the broom  what do we do 
  leave it to me 
come on  hermione 
lacarnum inflamarae 
fire  you re on fire 
go  go  go  go 
looks like he s gonna be sick 
he s got the snitch 
harry potter receives 150 points
for catching the snitch 
gryffindor wins 
nonsense  why would snape
put a curse on harry s broom 
who knows  why was he trying
to get past that three headed dog 
  who told you about fluffy 
  fluffy 
  that thing has a name 
  of course he has a name  he s mine 
i bought him off an irishman 
i lent him to dumbledore to guard   
shouldn t have said that 
no more questions  that s top secret 
but whatever fluffy s guarding 
snape s trying to steal it 
codswallop  professor snape
is a hogwarts teacher 
teacher or not  i know a spell when
i see one  i ve read all about them 
you ve got to keep eye contact 
and snape wasn t blinking 
exactly 
now  you listen to me 
all three of you 
you re meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in  it s dangerous 
what that dog is guarding is
between dumbledore and nicholas flamel 
nicholas flamel 
i shouldn t have said that 
i should not have said that 
nicholas flamel 
who s nicholas flamel 
i don t know 
merry christmas
merry christmas
ring the hogwart bell
merry christmas
merry christmas
cast a christmas spell
knight to e5 
queen to e5 
that s totally barbaric 
that s wizard s chess 
i see you ve packed 
i see you haven t 
change of plans  my parents went
to romania to visit my brother charlie 
  he s studying dragons there 
  good  you can help harry 
he s going to the library
to look up nicholas flamel 
we ve looked a hundred times 
not in the restricted section 
happy christmas 
i think we ve had
a bad influence on her 
harry  wake up 
come on  harry  wake up 
  happy christmas  harry 
  happy christmas  ron 
what are you wearing 
oh  my mum made it 
looks like you ve got one too 
  i ve got presents 
  yeah 
there they are 
 your father left this
in my possession before he died 
it is time it was returned to you 
use it well  
  what is it 
  some kind of cloak 
well  let s see  then  put it on 
my body s gone 
i know what that is 
that s an invisibility cloak 
i m invisible 
they re really rare 
i wonder who gave it to you 
there was no name 
it just said   use it well  
famous fire eaters 
fifteenth century fiends 
flamel  nicholas flamel 
where are you 
who s there 
i know you re in there 
you can t hide 
who is it  show yourself 
severus  i   
you don t want me
as your enemy  quirrell 
  i don t know what you mean 
  you know perfectly well what i mean 
we ll have another little chat soon 
when you ve had time to decide
where your loyalties lie 
professors  i found this
in the restricted section 
it s still hot  that means
there s a student out of bed 
mum 
dad 
ron  you ve really gotta see this 
ron  you ve gotta see this 
ron  come on  get out of bed 
  why 
  there s something you ve got to see 
come on  come 
come look  it s my parents 
i only see us 
look in properly 
go on  stand there 
  there  you see them  don t you 
  that s me  only i m head boy 
and i m holding the quidditch cup 
and bloody hell 
i m quidditch captain too 
i look good 
harry  do you think this mirror
shows the future 
how can it 
both my parents are dead 
back again  harry 
i see that you 
like many before you   
   have discovered the delights
of the mirror of erised 
i trust by now
you realize what it does 
let me give you a clue 
the happiest man on earth   
   would look in the mirror
and see only himself   
   exactly as he is 
so then  it shows us what we want 
whatever we want 
yes  and no 
it shows us nothing more or less   
   than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts 
now you  harry  who have
never known your family   
   you see them standing beside you 
but remember this  harry 
this mirror gives us
neither knowledge   
   or truth 
men have wasted away in front of it 
even gone mad 
that is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home 
and i must ask you   
   not to go looking for it again 
it does not do to dwell on dreams   
   and forget to live 
i had you looking in the wrong section 
how could i be so stupid 
i checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading 
this is light 
of course  here it is 
nicholas flamel is the only known
maker of the philosopher s stone 
the what 
honestly  don t you two read 
 the philosopher s stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers 
it ll transform any metal
into pure gold   
   and produces the elixir of life
which will make the drinker immortal  
  immortal 
  it means you ll never die 
i know what it means 
 the only stone currently in existence
belongs to mr  nicholas flamel   
   the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday  
that s what fluffy s guarding 
that s what s under the trap door 
the philosopher s stone 
don t wish to be rude 
but i m in no state to entertain 
we know about the philosopher s stone 
  we think snape s trying to steal it 
  are you still on about him 
we know he s after it 
we don t know why 
snape is one of the teachers
protecting the stone  he won t steal it 
what 
you heard  come on 
i m a bit preoccupied today 
wait a minute 
 one of the teachers  
there are other things
defending the stone  aren t there 
  spells  enchantments 
  right 
waste of bloody time  if you ask me 
ain t no one gonna get past fluffy 
ain t a soul knows how 
except for me and dumbledore 
i shouldn t have told you that 
i should not have told you that 
  hagrid  what exactly is that 
  that  it s   
i know what that is 
but  hagrid  how did you get one 
i won it  off a stranger
i met down at the pub 
seemed quite glad to be rid of it 
as a matter of fact 
is that   
   a dragon 
that s not just a dragon 
that s a norwegian ridgeback 
my brother works
with these in romania 
isn t he beautiful  oh  bless him 
look  he knows his mummy 
hello  norbert 
  norbert 
  he s gotta have a name  don t he 
don t you  norbert 
he ll have to be trained up a bit 
of course 
who s that 
malfoy 
oh  dear 
hagrid always wanted a dragon 
told me so the first time i met him 
it s crazy 
and worse  malfoy knows 
  i don t understand  is that bad 
  it s bad 
good evening 
nothing  i repeat  nothing   
   gives a student the right
to walk about at night 
therefore  as punishment for your actions 
50 points will be taken 
  50  
  each 
to ensure it doesn t happen again   
   all four of you
will receive detention 
excuse me  professor 
perhaps i heard you wrong 
i thought you said the four of us 
no  you heard me correctly 
honorable as your intentions were 
you too were out of bed after hours 
you will join your classmates
in detention 
a pity they let
the old punishments die 
was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons 
god  i miss the screaming 
you ll be serving detention
with hagrid tonight 
he s got a little job to do
inside the dark forest 
a sorry lot  this  hagrid 
good god  you re not still on
about that bloody dragon  are you 
norbert s gone 
dumbledore sent him off to romania
to live in a colony 
that s good  isn t it 
he s with his own kind 
what if he don t like romania 
what if the other dragons are mean
to him  he s only a baby 
for god s sake  pull yourself together 
you re going into the forest 
got to have your wits about you 
the forest  i thought that was a joke 
we can t go in there 
students aren t allowed 
and there are   
   werewolves 
there s more than werewolves
in those trees 
you can be sure of that 
nighty night 
right  let s go 
hagrid  what is that 
what we re here for 
see that 
that s unicorn blood  that is 
i found one dead a few weeks ago 
now  this one s been hurt bad
by something 
so  it s our job to go
and find the poor beast 
ron  hermione  come with me 
and  harry  you ll go with malfoy 
okay  then i get fang 
fine  just so you know 
he s a bloody coward 
wait till my father hears about this 
this is servant s stuff 
if i didn t know better 
i d say you were scared 
i m not scared  potter 
do you hear that 
come on  fang 
scared 
what is it  fang 
harry potter  you must leave 
you are known to many creatures here 
the forest is not safe at this time 
especially for you 
what was that thing you saved me from 
a monstrous creature 
it is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn 
drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death 
but at a terrible price  for you
have slain something so pure   
   that the moment the blood touches
your lips  you will have a half life 
a cursed life 
  who would choose such a life 
  can you think of no one 
do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn   
   that was drinking its blood 
that was voldemort 
do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment 
the philosopher s stone 
harry 
hello there  firenze 
see you ve met our young mr  potter 
you all right there  harry 
harry potter 
this is where i leave you 
you re safe now  good luck 
you mean  you know who is out there
right now in the forest 
but he s weak 
he s living off the unicorns 
don t you see  we had it wrong 
snape doesn t want the stone for himself 
he wants it for voldemort 
with the elixir of life 
voldemort will be strong again 
he ll come back 
but if he comes back   
   you don t think he ll try
to kill you  do you 
if he d had the chance 
he might have tried tonight 
and to think i ve been worrying
about my potions final 
hang on a minute 
we re forgetting one thing 
who s the one wizard
voldemort always feared 
dumbledore  as long as dumbledore
is around  harry  you re safe 
as long as dumbledore is around 
you can t be touched 
i d heard hogwarts  final exams were
frightful  but i found that enjoyable 
speak for yourself 
all right there  harry 
  my scar  it keeps burning 
  it s happened before 
  not like this 
  you should see the nurse 
i think it s a warning 
it means danger s coming 
  of course 
  what is it 
isn t it odd that what hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon   
   and a stranger just happens
to have one 
how many people wander around
with dragon eggs 
why didn t i see it before 
who gave you the egg 
what did he look like 
i never saw his face 
he kept his hood up 
you and this stranger
must have talked 
he wanted to know what sort
of creatures i looked after 
i said   after fluffy 
a dragon s gonna be no problem  
  was he interested in fluffy 
  of course he was interested 
how often do you come across
a three headed dog 
but i told him   the trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him  
take fluffy  for example  play him
music and he falls straight to sleep 
i shouldn t have told you that 
where are you going 
we have to see dumbledore 
immediately 
i m afraid he s not here 
he received an urgent owl
from the ministry of magic and left 
he s gone 
but this is important 
this is about the philosopher s stone 
  how do you know 
  someone s going to try and steal it 
i don t know how you know 
but i assure you it is well protected 
now would you go back
to your dormitories  quietly 
that was no stranger hagrid met 
it was snape 
which means he knows
how to get past fluffy 
  and with dumbledore gone   
  good afternoon 
what would three young gryffindors   
   be doing inside on a day like this 
  we were just   
  you ought to be careful 
people will think you re   
   up to something 
now what do we do 
we go down the trap door  tonight 
trevor 
trevor  go  you shouldn t be here 
neither should you 
you re sneaking out again  aren t you 
  neville  listen  we were   
  no  i won t let you 
you ll get gryffindor into trouble again 
i ll fight you 
neville  i m really sorry about this 
petrificus totalus 
you re a little scary sometimes 
you know that 
brilliant  but scary 
let s go 
  sorry 
  it s for your own good  you know 
  you stood on my foot 
  sorry 
alohomora 
wait a minute  he s   
   snoring 
snape s already been here 
he s put a spell on the harp 
it s got horrible breath 
  we have to move its paw 
  what 
come on 
okay  push 
i ll go first  don t follow
until i give you a sign 
if something bad happens 
get yourselves out 
does it seem a bit quiet to you 
the harp 
it s stopped playing 
jump 
lucky this plant thing s here  really 
stop moving  both of you 
this is devil s snare 
you have to relax  if you don t 
it will only kill you faster 
kill us faster 
oh  now i can relax 
hermione 
  now what are we gonna do 
  just relax 
  hermione  where are you 
  do what i say  trust me 
  are you okay 
  yeah  i m fine 
  he s not relaxing  is he 
  apparently not 
  we ve gotta do something 
  what 
i remember reading something
in herbology 
devil s snare  devil s snare 
it s deadly fun   
   but will sulk in the sun 
that s it  it hates sunlight 
lumus solem 
  ron  you okay 
  yeah 
lucky we didn t panic 
lucky hermione pays attention
in herbology 
what is that 
i don t know  sounds like wings 
curious  i ve never seen
birds like these 
they re not birds 
they re keys 
and i ll bet one of them
fits that door 
  what s this all about 
  i don t know 
strange 
alohomora 
well  it was worth a try 
what will we do 
there must be a thousand keys 
we want a big  old fashioned one 
probably rusty 
i see it 
the one with the broken wing 
what s wrong 
it s too simple 
go on  if snape could catch it
on that old broomstick  you can 
you re the youngest seeker
in a century 
this complicates things a bit 
catch the key 
hurry up 
i don t like this 
i don t like this at all 
where are we  a graveyard 
this is no graveyard 
it s a chessboard 
there s the door 
now what do we do 
it s obvious  isn t it  we ve got
to play our way across the room 
harry  you take
the empty bishop s square 
hermione  you ll be
the queen side castle 
as for me  i ll be a knight 
what happens now 
well  white moves first 
and then   
   we play 
ron  you don t suppose
this is going to be like   
   real wizard s chess  do you 
you there  d5 
yes  hermione 
i think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard s chess 
castle to e4 
pawn to c3 
  wait a minute 
  you understand right  harry 
once i make my move 
the queen will take me 
then you re free to check the king 
  no  ron  no 
  what is it 
  he s going to sacrifice himself 
  no  there must be another way 
do you wanna stop snape
from getting that stone or not 
harry  it s you that has to go on 
i know it 
not me  not hermione  you 
knight to h3 
check 
ron 
no  don t move 
don t forget  we re still playing 
checkmate 
take care of ron 
then go to the owlery 
send a message to dumbledore 
ron s right 
i have to go on 
you ll be okay  harry 
you re a great wizard  you really are 
not as good as you 
me  books and cleverness 
there are more important things 
friendship and bravery 
and  harry  just be careful 
you 
no  it can t be 
snape  he was the   
yes  he does seem the type 
doesn t he 
next to him  who would suspect   
   poor  stuttering
professor quirrell 
but that day  during the quidditch match 
snape tried to kill me 
no  dear boy  i tried to kill you 
if snape s cloak hadn t caught
fire and broken my eye contact   
   i would have succeeded 
even with snape muttering
his countercurse 
snape was trying to save me 
i knew you were a danger to me 
especially after halloween 
  then you let the troll in 
  very good  potter  yes 
snape  unfortunately  wasn t fooled 
while everyone ran about 
he went to the third floor to head me off 
he  of course  never trusted me again 
he rarely left me alone 
but he doesn t understand 
i m never alone  never 
now  what does this mirror do 
i see what i desire 
i see myself holding the stone 
but how do i get it 
use the boy 
come here  potter  now 
tell me  what do you see 
what is it  what do you see 
i m shaking hands with dumbledore 
i ve won the house cup 
he lies 
tell the truth  what do you see 
  let me speak to him 
  master  you are not strong enough 
i have strength enough for this 
harry potter   
   we meet again 
voldemort 
yes  you see what i ve become 
see what i must do to survive 
live off another  a mere parasite 
unicorn blood can sustain me   
   but it cannot give me
a body of my own 
but there is something that can 
something that  conveniently enough 
lies in your pocket 
stop him 
don t be a fool 
why suffer an horrific death   
   when you can join me and live 
never 
bravery  your parents had it too 
tell me  harry   
   would you like to see
your mother and father again 
together   
   we can bring them back 
all i ask is for something in return 
that s it  harry 
there is no good and evil 
there is only power   
   and those too weak to seek it 
together  we ll do
extraordinary things 
just give me the stone 
you liar 
kill him 
  what is this magic 
  fool  get the stone 
good afternoon  harry 
  tokens from your admirers 
  admirers 
what happened in the dungeons between
you and professor quirrell is a secret 
so  naturally  the whole school knows 
i see that your friend ronald
has saved you the trouble   
   of opening your chocolate frogs 
ron was here  is he all right 
what about hermione 
fine  they re both just fine 
  what happened to the stone 
  relax  dear boy 
the stone has been destroyed 
my friend nicholas and i
have had a little chat   
   and agreed it was best all around 
but then  flamel 
he ll die  won t he 
he has enough elixir
to set his affairs in order 
but yes  he will die 
how is it i got the stone  sir 
one minute i was staring
in the mirror and   
you see  only a person   
   who wanted to find the stone 
find it   
   but not use it 
would be able to get it 
that is one of my more brilliant ideas 
and between you and me 
that is saying something 
does that mean  with the stone gone 
that voldemort can never come back 
i m afraid   
   there are ways
in which he can return 
harry  do you know why   
   professor quirrell couldn t bear
to have you touch him 
it was because of your mother 
she sacrificed herself for you 
and that kind of act leaves a mark 
no  this kind of mark cannot be seen 
  it lives in your very skin 
  what is it 
love  harry  love 
bertie bott s every flavor beans 
i was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit flavored one 
and since then 
i ve lost my liking for them 
but i think i could be safe   
   with a nice toffee 
alas 
earwax 
  all right there  ron 
  all right  you 
all right  hermione 
never better 
another year gone 
and now  as i understand it 
the house cup needs awarding 
and the points stand thus 
in fourth place 
gryffindor with 312 points 
third place 
hufflepuff with 352 points 
in second place   
   ravenclaw with 426 points 
and in first place   
   with 472 points  slytherin house 
nice one  mate 
yes  well done  slytherin 
well done 
however  recent events must
be taken into account 
and i have a few last minute points
to award 
to miss hermione granger 
for the cool use of intellect   
   while others were in grave peril   
   50 points 
good job 
second  to mr  ronald weasley 
for the best played game of chess   
   that hogwarts has seen
these many years  50 points 
and third   
   to mr  harry potter   
   for pure nerve
and outstanding courage   
   i award gryffindor house 60 points 
we re tied with slytherin 
finally  it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies   
   but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends 
i award 10 points   
   to neville longbottom 
assuming that my calculations
are correct   
   i believe that a change
of decoration is in order 
gryffindor wins the house cup 
come on  now 
hurry up  you ll be late 
train s leaving  go on 
come on  hurry up 
  come on  harry 
  one minute 
thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye  did you 
this is for you 
thanks  hagrid 
go on  on with you  on with you now 
oh  listen  harry 
if that dolt of a cousin of yours 
dudley  gives you any grief   
   you could always threaten him   
   with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail 
but we re not allowed to do magic
away from hogwarts  you know that
