fine
elegant in his top hat

ben eagle the magician
is in reality
a super crime fighter
in todays episode
is tyra finally safe
from the clutches of sir pent
hey going for a drink
but the live show is next
this is what happens
to ben eagles precious interest
youll never get away with it
what are we gonna do
there are too many
interpretation kid falcon
i hope this works
ben eagle
ben eagle
and now the moment of truth
i am searching
searching for the one
who the high lama of tibet told me
would be in this very room
the chosen one
me
you
look whos here
london
my boy
hey sam
hey london the usual
what you are about to see
is not an illusion
you will bear witness
to a profound experience
the movement of an inanimate object
through inner power
but im not gonna perform it
my new colleague will
now you have the power
its up to you
to achieve the impossible
but theyre gonna make fun of me
not if you move the bottle they wont
you just do as i say
raise your hands and point them
at the bottle there
get off the stage runt
ignore the world ignore the world
focus
stand up little boy
he is standing
get him a step stool
do you believe you can do this
partner do you believe you can do this
do you believe you can move it
yes or no
yes i believe i can move the bottle
i dont believe you
yes i believe i can move it
louder
yes i can move the bottle
thats the kind of faith that moses had
when he parted the red sea
the kind of faith that little david
had when he defeated goliath
with a little stone
thats what we need my friends
in these difficult times
so like father oliver used to ask
what can we do
what can we do for our relatives at war
what can we do if we are here
and they are there
and the answer is
if we have faith the size
of a mustard seed
we can move a mountain
if we can move a mountain
then nothing will be impossible for us
not even ending this war
and having our loved ones back
i already knew someone
who could move a mountain
i wondered if the source of his powers
was the mustard seed
this was a source of unlimited powers
so if this was true
this was all i needed to
and there he was
the enemy
london
what
theres a jap at gilliams
i couldnt understand how one of them
was free in ohare
after pearl harbor
they put them all in camps
after years of internment
the army in its wisdom
has decided to release
those of japanese ancestry
who have proven loyal to the us
they seem harmless dont they
but can we trust them
well i for one remember pearl harbor
so i say remain vigilant
store doesnt serve japs
everything okay here
you forgot the onions hashimoto
put these on my tab
father with all due respect
now gilliam
these too
of course father
im getting sick and tired of hearing
again and again and again
about pearl harbor and about how my son
gave his life for his country
because he didnt
those japs took his life
and they did it in the most
cowardly way you can imagine
we need to do something about that jap
if i could i would smash
every jap with my bare hands
thats the rats dump
you want to smash him
with your bare hands
here you go
have at him
go on
there he is
take that dirty jap
maybe thisll let him know
that slants aint welcome
i finally understood why
they dont let flat feet into the army
five groups of 10 hail marys
and five our fathers
in latin
sancta maria mater dei
ora pro nobis peccatoribus
nunc et in hora mortis nostrae amen
now you
in latin
thank god nothing happened to hashimoto
ive finished
very good
something else
the seed itself doesnt do anything
what i said is
if you have faith
the invisible power
like ben eagles powers
ben eagle
well no thats just fantasy
how can you say that
i met ben eagle and he showed me
how to move a bottle
he can also move a mountain
just like you said
no no no thats not the same thing
thats not faith lets see
if you have faith fides in latin
crispin
ill take it from here
i understand
take a seat
why dont you show me
how you moved the bottle
you want to see
yes i do
i guess that was stupid of me
why dont you try again
again
there it moved
no you moved it
yes because you moved me to move it
see i moved it because you wanted
the bottle to move so much
and that you could say
is how faith works
at least some of the time
and this is as much as i need
to move a mountain
in theory yes
but its up to him
hes the mover
how could i get bigger faith
the list the ancient list
for centuries people believed
that if you do this list
itll make your faith powerful
this is what you have to do
feed the hungry
shelter the homeless
visit those in prison
clothe the naked
naked
how is that supposed to
visit the sick
bury the dead
oh just one more thing
in order to make this list work for you
im gonna add one essential item
befriend hashimoto are you crazy
its your choice pepper
what does that jap
have to do with anything
everything
your faith wont work
if you have even the slightest bit
of hatred in you
fine ill do it if thats what
it takes to bring my dad back
come again
bring my dad back
yes but only if its gods will
why wouldnt god
want to bring my dad back
i dont know
but if i get enough faith
nothings impossible right
yeah
what do you want
im sorry about the other day
so were you nice to him
yeah how can anyone
be friends with a jap
take him a gift as a peace offering
hey jap
want a soda
and all he did was
throw it in the trash
oh i think youll be okay
hang out with him
hang out
yep just get to know him
ollie why are you getting me
involved in this
i just dont see how this helps anyone
yes yes he did
but i dont even drink soda

then can i scratch you from my list
what list
father olivers ancient list
no ollie
you told the boy that if he waves
a magic wand he can bring his father back
you dont believe that do you
maybe
maybe not
if its gods will yes
he can do anything he could turn you
into a rabbit if he wanted to
have faith hashimoto
you should try it
not again
i do have faith
faith in oneself
not in your imaginary friend in the sky
lets hope this little game of yours
doesnt mess with the boys mind
two weeks but what about the list

kume
samurai
whats that
you dont know what a samurai is
these are samurai
japanese warriors
what ones masao kume
this is masao kume
he doesnt look like a warrior
he wasnt
not yet
masao kume was small
powerless
nothing but a servant
but in every mans life
there comes a day of truth
and that day came
when the mongols invaded japan
who are the mongols
they were bullies
samurai tried to defend their land
but mongols had bukha the immense
the mongols issued a challenge
if anyone could defeat bukha in battle
they would leave japan never to return
masao kume believed
that nothing was more powerful
than the will
the will to face ones fear
and to act
stand
now dont measure yourself
from here to the floor
measure yourself from here to the sky
that makes you the tallest boy in town
hey freddy look
someones giving you the stink eye

photo of my two nephews
takeshi and koji
they probably live in my hometown still
havent heard from them since
the war changed everything
yes it has
for everyone
and did they send you away to the camps
that is not the kind of question you ask
no mrs busbee its okay
its simple
i have the face of the enemy
doesnt matter if this is my home
doesnt matter if i love
this land this country
mom wheres that other set of keys

mrs busbee
pepper
get out now
or ill shoot you where you stand
get out
a jap will not eat at my fathers table
this is all your fault
dad had to go to war
because you couldnt
listen to me if i see you
hanging out with that rat
i will smack you in front of everyone
enough
you need to stop this nonsense
stop what
stop an eightyearold boy from thinking
that he can do something to help his dad
tell me london
what is so wrong with that
nothing
except for when the day comes
to tell him the japs killed his father
stop saying your dad is dead
mom im just trying to be prepared
oh shut up
look at that
you should go home now
is this man bothering you
no
hes my friend
look i have no business here with you
all due respect im going my way
with all due respect
youre not going anywhere just yet
am i a joke to you
listen to me if i see you around my brother
again i will put a bullet in your head
do you understand me
that wont be needed
i think mr buddhahead
here understands
you got one week to pack your crap
and get your yellow hide out of here
what you dont believe me
you stay and find out
hey
you want to do something for dad
then you stop palling around with this rat
stupid priest filling your head
with a bunch of fairy tales
what if i can
what if i can bring dad back
dad back
how how are you gonna
bring dad back you idiot
like like with the mustard seed
you can move a mountain
fine
you want to move a mountain
theres one go ahead
move it move it
move it for everyone
you dont have to do it
hes just trying to humiliate you
hey hey hey hey hey
not now no
calm down
thats it
do you know when father olivers
coming back
thats the little boy
this was much more
than just an earthquake
what was it
its a miracle
let people believe what they want
they need crap like this to believe
that theres something bigger than them
truth is that earthquake wouldve happened
whether that boy was there or not
ive been walking to work for 35 years
and im telling you
that mountain was definitely
more to the right right
father oliver
what what
yes i heard about it on the
no a boy moved a mountain
he moved a what
i figured it out
hashimoto
japan is practically straight
in front of us
now if you point to where the sun
touches the sea
youd be pointing directly at japan
why the sudden interest
i need to end the war
my dad cant come back until its over
you mean doing this
yes
all right maybe its time
im honest with you
i dont believe that you moved
any mountain
or you had anything to do
with the earthquake
you were there how could you say that
i just dont believe that anyone
in the world could do such a thing
then are you saying i should stop
i would say do what makes sense for you
its just a loan for goodness sake
a loan from that fox has enough strings
to start a puppet factory
and what do you suggest then
lose your fathers shop
we can pay him back
when your dad gets home
i think dr fox is counting
on dad never coming home
and his loan required you
to get all dolled up
today is me and your dads
wedding anniversary
im sorry
whats little boy doing
i do believe men
can move mountains ollie
with dynamite
i believe that what happened to the mountain
cant be reduced to a game of chance
much of life is a gamble ollie
youre advising a desperate child
whos ready to believe anything
that he is told
so tell me ollie
what happens when your imaginary friend
works in his mysterious ways
and his father dies
then my imaginary friend
will also help him through it
tell the kid to stop
if he doesnt
could lose faith in himself
thats what you should be
worrying about
said it in the papers
little boy
thats little boy
there he is
little boys here
you did it
you did it son
go on go on read it to him
give me that
listen to this little boy
the greatest power known to man
has been unleashed
yesterday at 515 our time
hiroshima was destroyed
by the force of the atomic bomb
codename
little boy
you did it
you did it
you did it
i did it
my dad is coming home
i did it
you did it little boy
my dad is coming home
i did it
my dad is coming home
did they say when dads coming back
i wish things were that simple
colonel bob said that
the bomb may not be good
for american prisoners
what do you mean
it means that the japanese may try to harm
your dad in revenge for the bomb
it wiped out an entire city
hello hashimoto
i warned you
but you dared stay
and looking on the bright side
i
ended up doing you a favor
its imprudent to keep all these
traitorous japanese souvenirs
since we are at war against japan
it was evil rats just like you
who cowardly murdered my son
the yellow fella
dont take a hint does he
doing this
wont bring back your son
sam
sam thats enough sam
lets get outta here
now
sam
sam we cant we cant just
leave him in there hes gonna die
if were caught here and he dies
we rot in jail do you understand me
get in the truck get in the truck now
okay you wanna play the hero
thats your choice
but you better be man enough
to face the consequences on your own
how is he
his heart is very weak
but hes gonna be okay right
i dont know
you have to let one die
make your choice
hashimoto
hashimoto
pepper
nurse
get the doctor
dr foley
i need oxygen
right away
mr hashimoto can you hear me
can you hear me
hes stopped breathing
please dont die
youre free
the jap dropped the charges
says you saved his life
whatever that means
maam
its time
we were told my father
was laid to rest in the philippines
my mother still chose to have
a memorial for him back home
let us commit james l busbees
body to the ground
earth to earth ashes to ashes
dust to dust
in the sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life
in the name of the father and of the son
and of the holy spirit
amen
youre my only partner
do you mind if i sit here
you know i
never got to say goodbye to my wife
by the time i got to the hospital
she was already in a coma
she died the next morning
i think it was stupid of me
to believe that a midget like me
could bring my dad back
with some stupid list
it was not stupid
it takes courage to believe
your father would be more
than proud of you
all the love you have for him
was contained in that list
i did this for you
39 inches same as before
im afraid i still dont have a
a diagnosis
for his irregular development
but i do have some theories
maybe i could come over the house
later and we could discuss them
perhaps tonight
i really appreciate the help
youve given us
i really do
but right now
my family needs some time alone
maybe after some time
youre a good man dr fox
but i will always be mrs james busbee
come on
i need more bandages
whats the name on this one
i got him i got him
get that on his head
james l busbee 39627771
you did it you little runt you did it
london
father oliver said god was responsible
for bringing my dad back
hashimoto said it was
my fathers will to live
he survived an extremely severe trauma
me
oh i was holding on
to my mustard seed
