gimme that 
in the name of the freakiest thing
alive  i baptize you 
 little boy  
okay  okay 
is my husband dead or alive

his body wasn t located at the scene 
we believe he s been taken
as a prisoner of war 
good luck getting out 
what s wrong 
he s barely eaten all week 
just take him  would you 
he got the extra ticket for your dad 
fine 
elegant in his top hat
and floating cane 
ben eagle  the magician   
is in reality   
a super crime fighter 
in today s episode 
is tyra finally safe
from the clutches of sir pent 
hey  going for a drink 
but the live show is next 
this is what happens
to ben eagle s precious interest 
you ll never get away with it 
what are we gonna do 
there are too many 
interpretation  kid falcon 
i hope this works 
ben eagle 
ben eagle 
and now  the moment of truth 
i am searching 
searching for the one
who the high lama of tibet told me
would be in this very room 
  the chosen one 
  me 
you 
look who s here 
london 
my boy 
  hey  sam 
  hey  london  the usual 
what you are about to see
is not an illusion 
you will bear witness
to a profound experience 
the movement of an inanimate object
through inner power 
but i m not gonna perform it 
my new colleague will 
now you have the power 
it s up to you
to achieve the impossible 
  but they re gonna make fun of me 
  not if you move the bottle  they won t 
you just do as i say 
raise your hands and point them
at the bottle  there 
get off the stage  runt 
ignore the world  ignore the world 
  focus 
  stand up  little boy 
  he is standing 
  get him a step stool 
do you believe you can do this 
partner  do you believe you can do this 
do you believe you can move it 
yes or no 
yes  i believe i can move the bottle 
  i don t believe you 
  yes  i believe i can move it 
  louder 
  yes  i can move the bottle 
that s the kind of faith that moses had
when he parted the red sea   
the kind of faith that little david
had when he defeated goliath
with a little stone 
that s what we need  my friends 
in these difficult times 
so like father oliver used to ask 
 what can we do 
what can we do for our relatives at war 
what can we do if we are here
and they are there 
and the answer is   
if we have faith the size
of a mustard seed 
we can move a mountain 
if we can move a mountain 
then nothing will be impossible for us 
not even ending this war   
and having our loved ones back 
i already knew someone
who could move a mountain 
i wondered if the source of his powers
was the mustard seed 
this was a source of unlimited powers 
so if this was true 
this was all i needed to   
and there he was   
the enemy 
  london 
  what 
there s a jap at gilliam s 
i couldn t understand how one of them
was free in o hare 
after pearl harbor 
they put them all in camps 
after years of internment 
the army  in its wisdom 
has decided to release
those of japanese ancestry
who have proven loyal to the us 
they seem harmless  don t they 
but can we trust them 
well  i for one  remember pearl harbor 
so i say   remain vigilant  
store doesn t serve japs 
everything okay here 
you forgot the onions  hashimoto 
put these on my tab 
  father  with all due respect   
  now  gilliam 
  these too 
  of course  father 
i m getting sick and tired of hearing
again and again and again
about pearl harbor and about how my son
 gave his life for his country  
because he didn t 
those japs took his life 
and they did it in the most
cowardly way you can imagine 
we need to do something about that jap 
if i could  i would smash
every jap with my bare hands 
that s the rat s dump 
you want to smash him
with your bare hands 
here you go 
have at him 
go on 
there he is 
take that  dirty jap 
maybe this ll let him know
that  slants  ain t welcome   
i finally understood why
they don t let flat feet into the army 
five groups of 10  hail marys 
and five  our fathers  
in latin 
sancta maria  mater dei 
ora pro nobis peccatoribus 
nunc  et in hora mortis nostrae  amen 
now you 
in latin 
thank god nothing happened to hashimoto 
  i ve finished 
  very good 
something else 
the seed itself doesn t do anything 
what i said is   
 if you have faith 
the invisible power    
  like ben eagle s powers 
   ben eagle  
well  no  that s just fantasy 
how can you say that 
i met ben eagle and he showed me
how to move a bottle 
he can also move a mountain 
just like you said 
no  no  no  that s not the same thing 
that s not faith  let s see 
  if you have faith   fides  in latin   
  crispin   
i ll take it from here 
i understand 
take a seat 
why don t you show me
how you moved the bottle 
  you want to see 
  yes  i do 
i guess that was stupid of me 
why don t you try again 
again 
there  it moved 
  no  you moved it 
  yes  because you moved me to move it 
see  i moved it because you wanted
the bottle to move so much 
and that  you could say 
is how faith works 
at least some of the time 
and this is as much as i need
to move a mountain 
in theory  yes 
but    it s up to him 
  he s the mover 
  how could i get bigger faith 
the list  the ancient list 
for centuries  people believed
that if you do this list 
it ll make your faith    powerful 
this is what you have to do 
 feed the hungry 
shelter the homeless 
visit those in prison 
  clothe the naked  
  naked 
how is that supposed to   
 visit the sick 
bury the dead  
oh  just one more thing 
in order to make this list work for you 
i m gonna add one essential item 
 befriend hashimoto    are you crazy 
it s your choice  pepper 
what does that jap
have to do with anything 
everything 
your faith won t work
if you have even the slightest bit
of hatred in you 
fine  i ll do it if that s what
it takes to bring my dad back 
  come again 
  bring my dad back 
yes  but only if it s god s will 
why wouldn t god
want to bring my dad back 
i don t know 
but if i get enough faith 
nothing s impossible  right 
yeah 
  what do you want 
  i m sorry about the other day 
so  were you nice to him 
yeah  how can anyone
be friends with a jap 
take him a gift  as a peace offering 
hey  jap 
want a soda 
and all he did was
throw it in the trash 
oh  i think you ll be okay 
  hang out with him 
  hang out 
yep  just get to know him 
ollie  why are you getting me
involved in this 
i just don t see how this helps anyone 
yes  yes  he did 
but i don t even drink soda 
jeez  just tell the kid to stop 
oh  no  he s back again 
hey 
what are you doing
monkeying around my house 
i want to hang out 
go hang out somewhere else 
i meant with you

you can get ice cream anytime 
next time  try chocolate 
now are we finished hanging out 
then can i scratch you from my list 
  what list 
  father oliver s  ancient list  
no  ollie 
you told the boy that if he waves
a magic wand  he can bring his father back 
  you don t believe that  do you 
  maybe 
maybe not 
if it s god s will  yes 
he can do anything  he could turn you
into a rabbit if he wanted to 
have faith  hashimoto 
you should try it 
not again 
i do have faith 
faith in oneself 
not in your imaginary friend in the sky 
let s hope this little game of yours
doesn t mess with the boy s mind 
two weeks  but what about the list 
  i already finished with the jap 
  really 
we re friends now 
you continue with mr  hashimoto till
i can t see the hate in your eyes anymore 
go and visit a prisoner 
you already know one 
i ll help you with the list
when i get back 
i promise 
befriend that rat
in order to get dad back 
by doing this stupid list 
by befriending him 
all you re doing is betraying dad 
hey 
where do you think
you re going  little boy 
come on 
jap lover

the ancient list  i need that one 
if you need it so bad 
take it back from him 
how  he s bigger than me 
everybody s bigger than me 
okay  stand up 
let s see how small you are 
right 
you re a very small boy  indeed 
toothpick arms  cricket legs   
size of masao kume 
  who s masao   
  kume 
  samurai 
  what s that 
you don t know what a samurai is 
these are samurai   
japanese warriors 
what one s masao    kume 
this is masao kume 
  he doesn t look like a warrior 
  he wasn t 
not yet 
masao kume was small 
powerless 
nothing but a servant 
but in every man s life 
there comes a day of truth 
and that day came
when the mongols invaded japan 
who are the mongols 
they were bullies 
samurai tried to defend their land 
but mongols had  bukha the immense  
the mongols issued a challenge 
if anyone could defeat bukha in battle 
they would leave japan  never to return 
masao kume believed
that nothing was more powerful   
than the will 
the will to face one s fear   
and to act 
stand 
now don t measure yourself
from here to the floor 
measure yourself from here to the sky 
that makes you the tallest boy in town 
hey  freddy  look 
someone s giving you the stink eye 
looking for something   
little boy 
maybe this  it s a magic list  right

you fat motherless pig 
  freddy  freddy  freddy  freddy 
  this ll teach you to never mess with me 
freddy  freddy  freddy

inviting a friend to eat

please come in  mr  hashimoto 
thank you  mrs  busbee

it s been 42 years
since i ve been in japan 
seems like a lifetime ago 
and do you still have
relatives over there 
all i have left
of all my relatives is a   
photo of my two nephews   
takeshi and koji 
they probably live in my hometown still 
haven t heard from them since   
the war changed everything 
yes  it has 
for everyone 
and did they send you away to the camps 
  that is not the kind of question you ask 
  no  mrs  busbee  it s okay 
it s simple 
i have the face of the enemy 
doesn t matter if this is my home 
doesn t matter if i love
this land  this country   
mom  where s that other set of keys

mrs  busbee 
pepper

or i ll shoot you where you stand 
get out 
a jap will not eat at my father s table 
this is all your fault 
dad had to go to war
because you couldn t 
listen to me  if i see you
hanging out with that rat 
  i will smack you in front of everyone   
  enough 
  you need to stop this nonsense 
  stop what 
stop an eight year old boy from thinking
that he can do something to help his dad 
tell me  london 
what is so wrong with that 
nothing 
except for when the day comes
to tell him the japs killed his father 
stop saying your dad is dead 
  mom  i m just trying to be prepared 
  oh  shut up 
look at that 
you should go home now 
is this man bothering you 
no 
he s my friend 
look  i have no business here with you 
all due respect  i m going my way 
with all due respect 
you re not going anywhere just yet 
am i a joke to you 
listen to me  if i see you around my brother
again  i will put a bullet in your head 
  do you understand me 
  that won t be needed 
i think  mr  buddha head 
here understands 
you got one week to pack your crap
and get your yellow hide out of here 
what  you don t believe me 
you stay and find out 
hey 
you want to do something for dad 
then you stop palling around with this rat 
stupid priest filling your head
with a bunch of fairy tales 
what if i can 
what if i can bring dad back 
dad back 
how  how are you gonna
bring dad back  you idiot 
like    like  with the mustard seed 
you can  move a mountain  
fine 
you want to move a mountain 
there s one  go ahead 
move it  move it 
move it for everyone 
you don t have to do it 
he s just trying to humiliate you 
hey  hey  hey  hey  hey 
not now  no 
calm down 
that s it 
do you know when father oliver s
coming back 
that s the little boy 
this was much more
than just an earthquake 
  what was it 
  it s a miracle 
let people believe what they want 
they need crap like this to believe
that there s something bigger than them 
truth is  that earthquake would ve happened
whether that boy was there or not 
i ve been walking to work for 35 years
and i m telling you 
that mountain was definitely   
more to the right  right 
father oliver 
what  what 
yes  i heard about it on the   
  no  a boy moved a mountain 
  he moved a what 
i figured it out 
hashimoto 
japan is practically straight
in front of us 
now if you point to where the sun
touches the sea 
you d be pointing directly at japan 
  why the sudden interest 
  i need to end the war 
my dad can t come back until it s over 
you mean doing this 
yes 
all right  maybe it s time
i m honest with you 
i don t believe that you moved
any mountain
or you had anything to do
with the earthquake 
you were there  how could you say that 
i just don t believe that anyone
in the world could do such a thing 
then are you saying i should stop 
i would say do what makes sense for you 
it s just a loan  for goodness  sake 
a loan from that fox has enough strings
to start a puppet factory 
and what do you suggest  then 
lose your father s shop 
we can pay him back
when your dad gets home 
i think dr  fox is counting
on dad never coming home 
and his loan required you
to get all dolled up 
today is me and your dad s
wedding anniversary 
i m sorry 
what s little boy doing 
i do believe men
can move mountains  ollie 
with dynamite 
i believe that what happened to the mountain
can t be reduced to a game of chance 
much of life is a gamble  ollie 
you re advising a desperate child
who s ready to believe anything
that he is told 
so tell me  ollie   
what happens when your imaginary friend
works in his mysterious ways   
and his father dies 
then my  imaginary friend 
will also help him through it 
tell the kid to stop 
if he doesn t 
could lose faith in himself 
that s what you should be
worrying about 
  said it in the papers 
  little boy 
that s little boy 
there he is 
little boy s here 
  you did it 
  you did it  son 
go on  go on  read it to him 
give me that 
listen to this  little boy 
 the greatest power known to man
has been unleashed 
yesterday at 5 15 our time 
hiroshima was destroyed
by the force of the atomic bomb 
codename    
 little boy  
  you did it 
  you did it 
you did it 
i did it 
my dad is coming home 
i did it 
  you did it  little boy 
  my dad is coming home 
i did it 
my dad is coming home 
did they say when dad s coming back 
i wish things were that simple 
colonel bob said that   
the bomb may not be good
for american prisoners 
what do you mean 
it means that the japanese may try to harm
your dad in revenge for the bomb 
it wiped out an entire city 
hello  hashimoto 
i warned you 
but you dared stay 
and looking on the bright side 
i   
ended up doing you a favor 
it s imprudent    to keep all these
traitorous japanese souvenirs 
since we are at war against japan 
it was evil rats just like you
who cowardly murdered my son 
the yellow fella
don t take a hint  does he 
doing this   
won t bring back your son 
sam 
sam  that s enough  sam 
let s get outta here 
now 
sam 
sam  we can t    we can t just
leave him in there  he s gonna die 
if we re caught here and he dies 
we rot in jail  do you understand me 
get in the truck  get in the truck now 
okay  you wanna play the hero 
that s your choice 
but you better be man enough
to face the consequences on your own 
how is he 
  his heart is very weak 
  but he s gonna be okay  right 
i don t know 
you have to let one die 
make your choice 
hashimoto 
hashimoto 
pepper 
nurse 
  get the doctor 
  dr  foley 
  i need oxygen 
  right away 
mr  hashimoto  can you hear me 
can you hear me 
he s stopped breathing 
please don t die 
you re free 
the jap dropped the charges 
says you saved his life 
whatever that means 
ma am 
it s time 
we were told my father
was laid to rest in the philippines 
my mother still chose to have
a memorial for him back home 
let us commit james l  busbee s
body to the ground 
earth to earth  ashes to ashes 
dust to dust 
in the sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life 
in the name of the father and of the son
and of the holy spirit 
amen 
you re my only partner 
do you mind if i sit here 
you know  i   
never got to say goodbye to my wife 
by the time i got to the hospital 
she was already in a coma 
she died the next morning 
i think it was stupid of me
to believe that a midget like me
could bring my dad back
with some stupid list 
it was not stupid 
it takes courage to believe 
your father would be more
than proud of you 
all the love you have for him
was contained in that list 
i did this for you 
39 inches  same as before 
i m afraid i still don t have a   
a diagnosis
for his irregular development 
but i do have some theories 
maybe i could come over the house   
later and we could discuss them 
perhaps tonight 
i really appreciate the help
you ve given us 
i really do 
but right now 
my family needs some time alone 
  maybe after some time   
  you re a good man  dr  fox 
but i will always be mrs  james busbee 
come on 
  i need more bandages 
  what s the name on this one 
i got him  i got him 
get that on his head 
 james l  busbee    39627771  
you did it  you little runt  you did it 
london 
father oliver said god was responsible
for bringing my dad back 
hashimoto said it was
my father s will to live 
he survived an extremely severe trauma 
me 
oh  i was holding on
to my mustard seed
