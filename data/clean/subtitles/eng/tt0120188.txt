  it was in the guy s dick 
  had to pull it out with a pair of tweezers 
  a 10 page atlas of saddam s bunkers 
yeah  only real small  like those books
you get in a box of cracker jacks 
they pull it out the guy ear 
  what 
   out of his ear  
maybe out the nose 
  what s he talking about 
   the nose  
  what body part

  it was stitched in back of his head 
  stitched in the back of his head 
  the guy s name

  better not be fucking with me 
  i m not 
  i want the story this time 
  you ll get the story  okay 
these have got to be saddam s
bunkers between karbala and nazaria 
what s inside 
according to intel 
picasso  sony  armani  rolex 
kuwait was like the arab beverly hills 
saddam jacked them for it 
be nice to bring something home
besides sand fleas 
one gold rolex would get me a very
nice house outside of garland 
five would get a lexus convertible 
  lexus doesn t make one 
  yes  they do 
it has room for a kid seat 
  infiniti has a convertible  not lexus 
  wrong 
either way  the lord put this map in
our path  i believe we ll find something 
he could also put a land mine
in our path 
i don t think so  i ve been fire
baptized  and this feels safe 
what are you talking about 
i have a ring of jesus fire
to guide my decisions 
  you re putting me on  right 
  do i look like i m putting you on 
okay  ring of jesus fire 
halt 
freeze  motherfucker 
  sir  this tent is restricted  sir 
  get out of my way 
sir  sir 
mayday  mayday  mayday  goddamn it 
good afternoon 
would this be the proctology tent 
no  sir 
maybe it s a urology tent 
or the neurology tent 
or the ear  nose and throat tent 
captain s at a staff meeting  sir 
captain a proctologist 
  what s a proctologist  sir 
  it doesn t matter 
i m not looking for him 
i m looking for barlow 
you re on the path to truth when you smell
shit  isn t that what they say  sergeant 
i don t recognize you  sir 
are you in this division 
he s not from this division 
he s special forces 
have you soldiers
presented this map to your captain 
not yet  sir 
i ll take it to him 
that s not necessary  sir 
he s my co  i can take it to him 
don t get grabby  sergeant 
he s our co  sir 
i d have to tell him you took it 
that won t do either of us any good 
will it 
no  sir 
sit down 
  what do you see here 
  bunkers  sir 
  what are in them 
  stuff they stole from kuwait 
bullshit  i m talking about
millions in kuwaiti bullions 
you mean them little cubes
you put in hot water and make soup 
no  not the little cubes
you put in hot water to make soup 
gold bricks  conrad 
saddam stole it from the sheiks 
i have no problem stealing it from saddam 
my guess is  he s divided these bricks
into several different stashes 
just one of these stashes would be easy
for us to take from his deserting army 
that would be enough
to get us out of our day jobs 
unless of course you reservists
are in love with your day jobs 
i don t really have a day job  sir 
first thing we have to do   
   is make sure this is more
than a love letter to an iraqi 
it s a series of bunkers
outside karbala  sir 
  maybe 
  definitely  sir 
the recon photos match 
we ll see 
dag 
it s what makes s f  so badass 
we got the best flashlights 
still looks like a series of bunkers 
three villages a little farther
to the east 
  seventy five clicks north 
  more like 65 
way north of any allied troops 
perfect  we don t want
any troops around 
yeah  just us and a humvee
up by the euphrates river valley 
where they put moses in the basket 
that s egypt 
we three kings be stealing the gold
quiet down 
my friends all drive porsches
i must make amends
  hey  just shut up  okay 
  are you done singing 
what about mines  sir 
grid was swept by the 82nd 
we ll stick to the roads 
are we gonna need
a deuce and a half 
  it s easier to slip out in a humvee 
  what if we have a lot to carry 
we ll grab an iraqi truck 
better cover if we get stopped 
  we could always say we captured it 
  that s right 
we leave at dawn  back before lunch 
no big deal 
  what s the guy s name outside 
  walter 
  bolo  get in here 
  who s bolo  sir 
bolo is a guy who
doesn t know what he s doing 
  yes  sir 
  want you to get this reporter   
   off my back 
know who adriana cruz is 
  reporter on nbs  sir 
  that s right 
tell her i m checking a story
and you re bringing her to meet me 
  in iraq 
  no 
i ll give you a fake copy of this map 
take her on a ride
that lasts all morning   
   and goes nowhere near
the villages outside of karbala 
when you don t find me  it ll be
because you got lost  is that clear 
  yes  sir 
  any other questions 
yeah  is it true that to be s f  
you gotta cut off an enemy s ear 
  are you able to control him 
  yes  sir  he ll be fine  i promise 
let s get ready to roll in the morning 
all right  here we go  ma am 
pull 
pull 
let me get some  chief 
pull 
  i gave you a better arc 
  what you talking about 
i threw the ball at a higher arc 
  made it easier 
  bullshit 
blacks make better receivers
than quarterbacks 
stop speaking 
warren moon is one of
the best in the league 
houston s gone nowhere
with warren moon 
  randall cunningham 
  don t get in the mud with him 
eagles ll never make it to
the super bowl with cunningham 
doug williams not only took
the redskins to the super bowl   
     but they won 
  yeah  so 
we can all agree there are many
excellent black quarterbacks 
let s see what you can hit 
come on  sorry ass cracker 
you ll never hit no iraqi 
i ll hit that iraqi 
i ll blow his fucking head off 
chief  he talks like that 
ignore him or it ll get worse 
you re right  you re right 
just can t help myself sometimes 
watch this 
whoa  unh 
  what was that 
  i rigged a football with c4  sir 
why would you do that 
you said we could fire off
some rounds when we left camp 
i said that you could fire a few rounds 
we didn t get to see any action  sir 
  you wanna see some action 
  yeah  i do  sir 
is this what you re after 
we dropped a lot of bombs here 
we also buried a lot of guys alive 
the only action we seen was on cnn 
except for that dude troy shot 
  shot him in the neck 
  that s right  sir 
fucking badass  i was there 
fucking took him out at 400 yards 
head popped up 3 feet in the air 
it was a crazy shot  man 
you know anything
about gunshot wounds 
  i don t know 
  specifically 
the worst thing about a gunshot wound 
provided you survive the bullet   
     is something called sepsis 
  infection of the blood 
right  say a bullet tears into you   
creates a cavity of dead tissue 
that cavity   
   it fills up with bile and bacteria 
you re fucked 
but we re gonna do this
without firing any shots   
   and just to be sure 
we re gonna do a dry run 
so get your suits on 
we will say that the cow is
a primary guard outside the bunker 
pull up fast  stop short 
move very aggressively  got it 
got it 
go 
who s hurt 
it s all cow 
yeah  it s all cow 
kaboom 
y all see that cow s head shoot up

  i was managed by the military 
  me too 
i try to be substance based

sexual politics in this business

it s about style 
many an anchormen came on to me 
i didn t go for it 
i never played that game  never dropped
to my knees for an assignment 
christ  i came out to the desert because
nobody else had the fucking balls to do it

you do it  not before you do it 
that s a dumb ass way to work 
it should be the other way around 
i know
