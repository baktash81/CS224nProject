antiiraqi type language and all that
did you get the aerials
howd you get those
chief is hooked up
hey keep walter on that door
would you take
those fucking things off
i never got to use night vision

just stand outside so chief
can translate my iraqi ass map okay
okay
are you ready to work with me now
im ready to work with you
good because ive got an amazing lead
it was in his ass
thats not the real story
whats the real story
it was in the guys dick
had to pull it out with a pair of tweezers
a 10page atlas of saddams bunkers
yeah only real small like those books
you get in a box of cracker jacks
they pull it out the guy ear
what
out of his ear
maybe out the nose
whats he talking about
the nose
what body part
let me handle this
it was stitched in back of his head
stitched in the back of his head
the guys name
what guy
the guy who found it
i cannot tell you
fuck that
you said you could
sorry not now
this guy doesnt know shit
adriana come here
he doesnt know shit
listen to me this guy is french
special forces and he can help us
he can
yes and hes my friend
but hes not gonna talk to me
if youre around
better not be fucking with me
im not
i want the story this time
youll get the story okay
these have got to be saddams
bunkers between karbala and nazaria
whats inside
according to intel
picasso sony armani rolex
kuwait was like the arab beverly hills
saddam jacked them for it
be nice to bring something home
besides sand fleas
one gold rolex would get me a very
nice house outside of garland
five would get a lexus convertible
lexus doesnt make one
yes they do
it has room for a kid seat
infiniti has a convertible not lexus
wrong
either way the lord put this map in
our path i believe well find something
he could also put a land mine
in our path
i dont think so ive been fire
baptized and this feels safe
what are you talking about
i have a ring of jesus fire
to guide my decisions
youre putting me on right
do i look like im putting you on
okay ring of jesus fire
halt
freeze motherfucker
sir this tent is restricted sir
get out of my way
sir sir
mayday mayday mayday goddamn it
good afternoon
would this be the proctology tent
no sir
maybe its a urology tent
or the neurology tent
or the ear nose and throat tent
captains at a staff meeting sir
captain a proctologist
whats a proctologist sir
it doesnt matter
im not looking for him
im looking for barlow
youre on the path to truth when you smell
shit isnt that what they say sergeant
i dont recognize you sir
are you in this division
hes not from this division
hes special forces
have you soldiers
presented this map to your captain
not yet sir
ill take it to him
thats not necessary sir
hes my co i can take it to him
dont get grabby sergeant
hes our co sir
id have to tell him you took it
that wont do either of us any good
will it
no sir
sit down
what do you see here
bunkers sir
what are in them
stuff they stole from kuwait
bullshit im talking about
millions in kuwaiti bullions
you mean them little cubes
you put in hot water and make soup
no not the little cubes
you put in hot water to make soup
gold bricks conrad
saddam stole it from the sheiks
i have no problem stealing it from saddam
my guess is hes divided these bricks
into several different stashes
just one of these stashes would be easy
for us to take from his deserting army
that would be enough
to get us out of our day jobs
unless of course you reservists
are in love with your day jobs
i dont really have a day job sir
first thing we have to do
is make sure this is more
than a love letter to an iraqi
its a series of bunkers
outside karbala sir
maybe
definitely sir
the recon photos match
well see
dag
its what makes sf so badass
we got the best flashlights
still looks like a series of bunkers
three villages a little farther
to the east
seventyfive clicks north
more like 65
way north of any allied troops
perfect we dont want
any troops around
yeah just us and a humvee
up by the euphrates river valley
where they put moses in the basket
thats egypt
we three kings be stealing the gold
quiet down
my friends all drive porsches
i must make amends
hey just shut up okay
are you done singing
what about mines sir
grid was swept by the 82nd
well stick to the roads
are we gonna need
a deuceandahalf
its easier to slip out in a humvee
what if we have a lot to carry
well grab an iraqi truck
better cover if we get stopped
we could always say we captured it
thats right
we leave at dawn back before lunch
no big deal
whats the guys name outside
walter
bolo get in here
whos bolo sir
bolo is a guy who
doesnt know what hes doing
yes sir
want you to get this reporter
off my back
know who adriana cruz is
reporter on nbs sir
thats right
tell her im checking a story
and youre bringing her to meet me
in iraq
no
ill give you a fake copy of this map
take her on a ride
that lasts all morning
and goes nowhere near
the villages outside of karbala
when you dont find me itll be
because you got lost is that clear
yes sir
any other questions
yeah is it true that to be sf
you gotta cut off an enemys ear
are you able to control him
yes sir hell be fine i promise
lets get ready to roll in the morning
all right here we go maam
pull
pull
let me get some chief
pull
i gave you a better arc
what you talking about
i threw the ball at a higher arc
made it easier
bullshit
blacks make better receivers
than quarterbacks
stop speaking
warren moon is one of
the best in the league
houstons gone nowhere
with warren moon
randall cunningham
dont get in the mud with him
eaglesll never make it to
the super bowl with cunningham
doug williams not only took
the redskins to the super bowl
but they won
yeah so
we can all agree there are many
excellent black quarterbacks
lets see what you can hit
come on sorryass cracker
youll never hit no iraqi
ill hit that iraqi
ill blow his fucking head off
chief he talks like that
ignore him or itll get worse
youre right youre right
just cant help myself sometimes
watch this
whoa unh
what was that
i rigged a football with c4 sir
why would you do that
you said we could fire off
some rounds when we left camp
i said that you could fire a few rounds
we didnt get to see any action sir
you wanna see some action
yeah i do sir
is this what youre after
we dropped a lot of bombs here
we also buried a lot of guys alive
the only action we seen was on cnn
except for that dude troy shot
shot him in the neck
thats right sir
fucking badass i was there
fucking took him out at 400 yards
head popped up 3 feet in the air
it was a crazy shot man
you know anything
about gunshot wounds
i dont know
specifically
the worst thing about a gunshot wound
provided you survive the bullet
is something called sepsis
infection of the blood
right say a bullet tears into you
creates a cavity of dead tissue
that cavity
it fills up with bile and bacteria
youre fucked
but were gonna do this
without firing any shots
and just to be sure
were gonna do a dry run
so get your suits on
we will say that the cow is
a primary guard outside the bunker
pull up fast stop short
move very aggressively got it
