that woman who gave evidence
against the doctors 
timashuk

we require for the situation 
the location of all the remaining
doctors in the moscow area 
a proven desire to survive
and a talent for fellatio 
yeah  right  she gets my vote

i always thought it would be you 
to fill stalin s shoes  if i m honest

who knows the future
of the union

could really use change 
maybe some reforms
now that the old man

abbott and costello over there 
christ 
when i piss  i try to make
eye contact with an officer

treacherous sow 
or a wronged woman who was framed

i m glad she s dead 
right  because 
well  she betrayed the party 
she plotted against stalin 
no  nicky  false narrative 
no  no  she was a parasite 
she was a parasite 
she betrayed all of us  and  in fact 
the evidence was flimsy 
there were no witnesses

of the soviet union 
apologies  a line has been crossed 
it is my duty to look good
for the people 
of course 
ah  comrade  apologies 
i m not gonna do the seating plan 
give it to blavatsky 
he s expert at sitting on his arse 
of course  thank you 
the committee meeting   
oh  yes  yes 
um  item one   
these lists and these arrests 
i think we   
should we take that down just a gear 
or hold off altogether 
freeze them 
freeze  yes 
excellent thought 
yes  we could freeze arrests 
we could even release
some low level prisoners 
 sighs in relief 
fuck me  i mean    i mean  yes 
but what would the old man   
oh  stalin    stalin destroyed
the status quo and he built a new one 
the changes he made
were both radical and popular 
liberalization would be radical 
popular 
radical 
and popular 
 door opens 
i will deal with whatever horseshit
you have presently 
actually  i d like you to see this 
come on through 
you remember that famous photo
of stalin and the little girl 
yes 
well  i was thinking
a photo of  you and the girl 
continuity 
and this way we re showing stalin s
humanity moving forward  right 
yeah 
i m sorry about all that 
find the girl 
we should head to the committee 
we are 
so i ll outline the releases
under article 31 
yes  please 
okay 
please  understand that this
is not some cynical ploy 
i mean  these reforms
are correct reforms 
totally understood 
are you wearing a corset 
it s a girdle  i have a bad back 
it s functional  it s not cosmetic 
you wear it well 
let s make this
a test of your discretion  shall we 
of course  of course 
so  in accordance   
i call this meeting to order 
my apologies 
so  in accordance with his will 
i propose comrade malenkov
be named chairman
of the council of ministers
and general secretary of the party 
malenkov  and i propose comrade beria
for first vice chairman 
council of ministers 
so  let s take a vote 
those in favour 
those are two separate proposals 
i suggest we vote one at a time 
those in favour 
i m unsure of what s being proposed 
i just said what was being proposed 
i just said it 
and you re being obstructionist 
comrade beria is busy
combining his role
as minister for both
interior and security 
wouldn t it be kinder if someone else
carried the happy burden
of vice chairman 
i thank comrade khrushchev
for his concern 
but i m perfectly capable
of doing two things at once 
well  it s three things 
should we bring in an abacus 
all right  let s move to a vote
on both proposals 
all right  first me as    you know 
and comrade beria as vice chairman 
all those in favour 
carried   
u    nanimously 
right  next 
we need someone
to take charge of the funeral 
what about comrade khrushchev 
where s this coming from 
i formally propose comrade khrushchev
be given the honour
of organizing the funeral 
what  come on 
i don t have any time to do that 
what if i can do three things at once 
you can at least do two 
 chuckling 
what do i know about funerals 
you said you wanted
to honour his legacy 
you told me last night
in the bathroom 
all those in    all those in favour 
all those in favour 
no  uh   
well  i think you d be good 
actually  you know 
 khrushchev sighs 
passed unanimously 
nicky khrushchev  funeral director 
it suits you 
yeah 
it suits that face  anyway 
 glass being tapped 
comrade beria 
i propose a halt to deportations 
the release of some existing detainees
under article 31 and the suspension
of all arrests that were officially
sanctioned three days ago 
whoa  whoa  that s like wiping
your arse on stalin s final list 
no  no  no 
this is demonstrably revisionist 
releasing people we arrested three
days ago will make us look cretinous 
listen  stalin was misled 
we were misled 
really   scoffs 
yes  so the people responsible
should be found and punished 
 laughs  who are you kidding 
lavrenti  yourself 
we all knew what we were doing
when we signed those lists 
stalin destroyed the status quo   
and he rebuilt it 
he was liberal 
radical 
he was radical 
this is a blatant attempt
by comrade beria
to buy the support of the public 
i thought you were in favour of a more
liberal approach  comrade reformer 
all those in favour
of pausing the arrests 
of pausing the executions 
all those in favour 
hmm  i ve always been loyal to stalin 
always 
and these arrests
were authorized by stalin 
but stalin was also loyal
to the collective leadership 
and that is true loyalty 
however  he also had an iron will 
undeviating  strong 
should we not do the same
and stick to what we believed in 
no 
it is stronger still
to forge our own beliefs
with the beliefs
of the collective leadership 
which i have now    done 
carried    unanimously  thank you 
i ll oversee the releases 
we have loosened
the union s great corset 
nicky  you ve some bouquets
and swatches to look at 
a funeral doesn t organize itself 
 gunshot and thud 
 gunshot and thud 
long live stalin 
stalin s dead  malenkov s in charge 
stop shooting 
long live malenk   
 shoots 
amnesty effective immediately 
orders of comrade beria 
we re moving out  let s go 
come on  let s go

 cries 
oh  my god

 classical music playing

example of harm 
he s okay

i want to make a speech
at my father s funeral 
and i want to fuck grace kelly 
i simply don t care 
i want to make a speech
at my father s funeral 
comrade malenkov  your view 
well  i think  um   
it can be  um   
no    no problem 
ah   
technically  yes  but practically   
there are programmatic complications 
you know  i think i misspoke
when i said   no problem  
what i meant was   no  
 problem  
ignore me  i m    it s no problem 
yes  i take that as a yes 
go ahead  nikita 
i will unlock the schedule
and squeeze him in 
i will not be squeezed 
sometimes the shortest speeches
are the most memorable 
well  that s as maybe 
true  fish  let s eat 
what s going on 
i don t   
 svetlana talking to guests 
i look forward
to the five garbled words
we afford him
before we start the flypast 
hey  we need to talk 
first the trains  now the bishops 
who else are we pals with now 
you invite any old nazis 
excuse me 
these stairs are like climbing
mount kilimanjaro 
i m more sweat than man 
did you see off vasily 
yes  we did 
and thank you
for landing me this funeral 
come on  nicky  you re enjoying it 
but why did you
have to invite the bishops 
what  you think i wanted
those boyfriends of christ here 
that was his idea 
lavrenti  you of all people must know
that religion
has never been part of   
you lecturing me 
you standing in the hall of columns
still insisting on polina s guilt 
well  she    she is   
 stutters 
um  sorry  maybe i shouldn t have   
oh  come on 
no  no  you both called
the blameless polina molotova
a traitor and a parasite
in her own apartment  i heard you 
she was guilty 
you found her guilty 
and stalin agreed 
nobody doubted 
nobody doubted 
past tense  you see 
in the good old days you pine for 
that sort of dissonance
would have had you both shot 
both of you 
oh   blows out 
this is just fucking wordplay 
oh  is it 
allegiance to the party line  hm 
that was what stalin demanded 
correct  comrade molotov 
um  allegiance to the party line  yes 
and defiance of the party line 
that would mark you out
as a traitor  wouldn t it 
i m ashamed and i    i   
i beg your forgiveness
for my selfish deceitfulness 
and i will go and reassure polina 
you re just making this shit up
as you go along 
what game is this  lavrenti 
oh  don t be hysterical 
we re in a new reality 
what  you re the good guy now 
you locked up half the nation 
you beat them  you raped them 
you killed them 
yes  and now i m releasing them 
and you won t believe
how many will be free 
so now you want the public
to love you  is that it 
you re bending and cracking the truth
like a human body 
the truth 
this from the man who invited
his bit on the side whore pianist
to play at the funeral 
even though she swore to kill stalin 
who s now dead 
whoa  what the barrelling fuck
are you talking about 
she wanted stalin dead
and she knows your family 
she taught your niece
to play  remember 
i think you should read this 
it s the copy of a note i found
by stalin s body  from the pianist 
it s lucky we both now live
in the new soviet union
or you and your wife and your family
would be a pile of dust
on the floor of a crematorium toilet 
kobulov  my stomach s rumbling 
is there any cheese in this building 
 exhales 
no  i don t have time
for that shit right now 
wait  wait  wait 
come back  come back 
no  go 
new security orders 
restart the trains  all right 
open the city s borders
and let the people back into moscow 
they deserve to see the old man 
let s see how beria s goons
cope with that 
 train whistle 
 steam hissing 
man  train to moscow in five minutes 
 lively chatter 
 train whistle 
 excited chatter 
 train whistle 
 footsteps 
 low chatter 
what s going on 
trains are bringing them in 
quiet  quiet  quiet 
turn around 
this is a secure area 
we ve come to see comrade stalin 
back  get back  back 
 shouting 
back 
stay back 
stay where you are 
 crowd shouting 
fire over their heads 
 gunshots and screaming 
 shouting and screaming 
don t let them through 
 gunshots 
 door bursts open 
this is your work  is it
