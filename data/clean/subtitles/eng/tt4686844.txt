of course thank you
the committee meeting
oh yes yes
um item one
these lists and these arrests
i think we
should we take that down just a gear
or hold off altogether
freeze them
freeze yes
excellent thought
yes we could freeze arrests
we could even release
some lowlevel prisoners
sighs in relief
fuck me i mean i mean yes
but what would the old man
oh stalin stalin destroyed
the status quo and he built a new one
the changes he made
were both radical and popular
liberalization would be radical
popular
radical
and popular
door opens
i will deal with whatever horseshit
you have presently
actually id like you to see this
come on through
you remember that famous photo
of stalin and the little girl
yes
well i was thinking
a photo of you and the girl
continuity
and this way were showing stalins
humanity moving forward right
yeah
im sorry about all that
find the girl
we should head to the committee
we are
so ill outline the releases
under article 31
yes please
okay
please understand that this
is not some cynical ploy
i mean these reforms
are correct reforms
totally understood
are you wearing a corset
its a girdle i have a bad back
its functional its not cosmetic
you wear it well
lets make this
a test of your discretion shall we
of course of course
so in accordance
i call this meeting to order
my apologies
so in accordance with his will
i propose comrade malenkov
be named chairman
of the council of ministers
and general secretary of the party
malenkov and i propose comrade beria
for first vicechairman
council of ministers
so lets take a vote
those in favour
those are two separate proposals
i suggest we vote one at a time
those in favour
im unsure of whats being proposed
i just said what was being proposed
i just said it
and youre being obstructionist
comrade beria is busy
combining his role
as minister for both
interior and security
wouldnt it be kinder if someone else
carried the happy burden
of vicechairman
i thank comrade khrushchev
for his concern
but im perfectly capable
of doing two things at once
well its three things
should we bring in an abacus
all right lets move to a vote
on both proposals
all right first me as you know
and comrade beria as vicechairman
all those in favour
carried
u nanimously
right next
we need someone
to take charge of the funeral
what about comrade khrushchev
wheres this coming from
i formally propose comrade khrushchev
be given the honour
of organizing the funeral
what come on
i dont have any time to do that
what if i can do three things at once
you can at least do two
chuckling
what do i know about funerals
you said you wanted
to honour his legacy
you told me last night
in the bathroom
all those in all those in favour
all those in favour
no uh
well i think youd be good
actually you know
khrushchev sighs
passed unanimously
nicky khrushchev funeral director
it suits you
yeah
it suits that face anyway
glass being tapped
comrade beria
i propose a halt to deportations
the release of some existing detainees
under article 31 and the suspension
of all arrests that were officially
sanctioned three days ago
whoa whoa thats like wiping
your arse on stalins final list
no no no
this is demonstrably revisionist
releasing people we arrested three
days ago will make us look cretinous
listen stalin was misled
we were misled
really scoffs
yes so the people responsible
should be found and punished
laughs who are you kidding
lavrenti yourself
we all knew what we were doing
when we signed those lists
stalin destroyed the status quo
and he rebuilt it
he was liberal
radical
he was radical
this is a blatant attempt
by comrade beria
to buy the support of the public
i thought you were in favour of a more
liberal approach comrade reformer
all those in favour
of pausing the arrests
of pausing the executions
all those in favour
hmm ive always been loyal to stalin
always
and these arrests
were authorized by stalin
but stalin was also loyal
to the collective leadership
and that is true loyalty
however he also had an iron will
undeviating strong
should we not do the same
and stick to what we believed in
no
it is stronger still
to forge our own beliefs
with the beliefs
of the collective leadership
which i have now done
carried unanimously thank you
ill oversee the releases
we have loosened
the unions great corset
nicky youve some bouquets
and swatches to look at
a funeral doesnt organize itself
gunshot and thud
gunshot and thud
long live stalin
stalins dead malenkovs in charge

comrade malenkov your view

when i said no problem
what i meant was no
problem
ignore me im its no problem
yes i take that as a yes
go ahead nikita
i will unlock the schedule
and squeeze him in
i will not be squeezed
sometimes the shortest speeches

well thats as maybe
true fish lets eat
whats going on
i dont
svetlana talking to guests
i look forward
to the five garbled words
we afford him
before we start the flypast
hey we need to talk
first the trains now the bishops
who else are we pals with now
you invite any old nazis
excuse me
these stairs are like climbing
mount kilimanjaro
im more sweat than man
did you see off vasily
yes we did
and thank you
for landing me this funeral
come on nicky youre enjoying it
but why did you
have to invite the bishops
what you think i wanted
those boyfriends of christ here
that was his idea
lavrenti you of all people must know
that religion
has never been part of
you lecturing me
you standing in the hall of columns
still insisting on polinas guilt
well she she is
stutters
um sorry maybe i shouldnt have
oh come on
no no you both called
the blameless polina molotova
a traitor and a parasite
in her own apartment i heard you
she was guilty
you found her guilty
and stalin agreed
nobody doubted
nobody doubted
past tense you see
in the good old days you pine for
that sort of dissonance
would have had you both shot
both of you
oh blows out
this is just fucking wordplay
oh is it
allegiance to the party line hm
that was what stalin demanded
correct comrade molotov
um allegiance to the party line yes
and defiance of the party line
that would mark you out
as a traitor wouldnt it
im ashamed and i i
i beg your forgiveness
for my selfish deceitfulness
and i will go and reassure polina
youre just making this shit up
as you go along
what game is this lavrenti
oh dont be hysterical
were in a new reality
what youre the good guy now
you locked up half the nation
you beat them you raped them
you killed them
yes and now im releasing them
and you wont believe
how many will be free
so now you want the public
to love you is that it
youre bending and cracking the truth
like a human body
the truth
this from the man who invited
his bitontheside whore pianist
to play at the funeral
even though she swore to kill stalin
whos now dead
whoa what the barrelling fuck
are you talking about
she wanted stalin dead
and she knows your family
she taught your niece
to play remember
i think you should read this
its the copy of a note i found
by stalins body from the pianist
its lucky we both now live
in the new soviet union
or you and your wife and your family
would be a pile of dust
on the floor of a crematorium toilet
kobulov my stomachs rumbling
is there any cheese in this building
exhales
no i dont have time
for that shit right now
wait wait wait
come back come back
