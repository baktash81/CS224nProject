for what you did
that was rockys money
you wanna be hysterical
you cost us everything
it was a mistake
you think i thought
this was gonna happen
dont you walk away from me
you just gave up our life
and you think its some stupid thing
paulie do you know what you did
do you know the seriousness of it
i understand it
i understand the whole freakin thing
i understand it
your accountants a crook not me
i did what i thought was right
dont blame me
i want to murder the bum
worse than anybody
adrian whats wrong
look what you done now
shes dumpin it all on me
come on dont turn this around on me
what did you do
he gave power of attorney
to our accountant
i just didnt gave anything to nobody
he sent a letter he says
well be in russia a couple of months
and i need rocky
to sign a tax extension
that extension was
a power of attorney paulie
hes the thief i need alcohol
rocky on my eyes
i never stole a freakin dime
adrian whats happenin here
its gone
whats gone
the money the money
everything its all gone
the piece of paper paulie had you sign
wasnt a request for a tax extension
it was a blanket power of attorney
in favour of the accountant
who was involved in
some highpriced real estate
he thought he could have your money
back before you knew it was gone
unfortunately for you
and everybody in this room
his deals fell through because the
market dried up and you lost millions
aint there nothin i can do
ive filed eight criminal acts against him
but youve got debt payment
on this property
he didnt pay your tax returns and your
mortgage hasnt been paid in months
we didnt have a mortgage
our house was fully paid for
dont take it from me ask him
theres nearly 400000 outstanding
the only thing thats not encumbered
is a gym willed to your son
by a mickey goldmill in 1982
you can sell things
remember those commercials you did
i aint no commercial kinda guy
im a fighter thats what i do
nah we couldnt get sponsors
with the investigation of the accountant
out pops a criminal record
of rockys for assault
but that was a long time ago
he didnt know
why not a couple more fights with
your popularity youd be out in no time
hes retiring
rocko fightins the ticket
i said hes retired
paulie were here because of you
im not taking the heat for all this
i thought i was doing smart business
you thought you did smart business
hey the accountant was your choice
you shoulda known he was a thief but in
your fairytale world the air dont move
youre like a season that dont change
hey enough
im not no tomato can you kick around
paulie no
you call duke tell him ill fight cane
i dont care anywhere any time
no rocky no
if thats what you want ill get on it
rocky please
a couple of fights were outta trouble
yeah but you said
no i didnt say anything
did we come this far to lose it
you have to see a doctor
i dont need a doctor i need a promoter
if the doctor says ok ill support you
i gotta fight ok
i got problems i gotta fight
will you do it for me
all right for you
because of continuous
violent blows to the head
you have a condition particular to boxers
called cavum septum pellucidum
which is a hole in the membrane
separating the ventricles
the brain surface neurons in this area
have also been traumatised
simply stated mr balboa it means youve
suffered some damage to the brain
adrian how long until he recovers
the effects are irreversible
oh i
rocky you you have to retire
i dont wanna retire this aint the time
to retire not in here not in no office
i just fought the best fight of my life
i just did that you know
and all i need is a couple more
no you suffered severe brain trauma
he could be wrong
anybody could be wrong
he aint god
adrian only god aint wrong
rocky this is whats good for you
i only need a couple of easy ones
not the way it is you cant get licensed
in any state he cant can he doctor
that is correct
rocky do you love me
yeah i love you why do you ask that
because if you love somebody
you live with them you live for them
you dont gamble with a life
rocky i dont care about the money
its you
thats all that matters
please well be ok well be fine
whispers

why if you wasnt here
hey i probably wouldnt be alive today
the fact that youre here and doin
as well as youre doin gives me
what do you call it
a motivisation to stay alive

little by little we lose our friends
we lose everything and we keep
losin and losin till we say
what the hell am i livin around

but with you kid
boy i got a reason to go on
and im gonna stay alive

outside the ring too is that ok

heavyweight champion of all time
tommy the machine gunn
do you think it was too easy
i took some shots but i was never hurt
im just glad to be the champ
dont you think this looked like more like
a sparring session than a championship
it didnt look like you broke a sweat
very observant
union cane wasnt feeling that good
but tommy gunn would have done
the same thing if union was 100
100 he fought like
he didnt have a heartbeat
we all know cane is a paper champion
what do you mean
canes title was manufactured
he never won it from balboa
gentlemen give him a break
will you ever get out
from underneath balboas shadow
i won the title what more do you want
youve gotta fight some real opponents
but i beat the best tonight
the best this guys a bum
he doesnt even deserve a title shot
gentlemen whoa were gettin carried
away cane was the recognised champ
we know the ratings system
can be manipulated
fact is tommy gunn
beat a secondrate fighter
with so much glass in his jaw
he oughta be a chandelier
this man will prove
to be a great champion
he might win a few fights
but a rocky balboa hell never be
no hes no rocky balboa
lets face it theres only one balboa
he was a true peoples champion
but in time tommy gunn may be
able to fill his shoes next question
not by fighting stiffs like cane he wont
ill fight anybody anywhere
when are you gonna fight a real fighter
gentlemen come on thank you for
coming tonight we look forward to
hey tommy i got somethin for ya
for your next fight try the redhead in the
front row i hear she comes real cheap
we look forward to seeing you
at tommy gunns next fight
why did you say balboas better
do you believe that
of course not look we cant talk in here
reporter who are you gonna
fight next tommy
what the hell happened in there i won
the damn title and they think im a bum
why didnt you back me up
when the press is right theyre right
im as good as balboa ever was and
im tired of being called a damn robot
listen tommy you cant fight the press
i cant fight them
as long as they got balboa on the brain
hes champ he fought wars in the ring
tommy face facts youre in his shadow
this is your own man talking
listen to me
there is a way to get the respect
you deserve challenge balboa to fight
george could set it up in just weeks
itd be the greatest fight ever
teacher against student
old lion against young lion
thats the only way
you ever gonna get peace of mind
that press will hound you with that mans
legend for as long as you wear gloves
you gotta get him into that ring tommy
or youll keep hearing questions like that
then youll start to ask yourself
could i take him am i good enough
do people think im a carbon copy
or a secondrate pretender who only
got a shot because of my skin tone
got to challenge
that man to fight tommy
if he refuses you gotta insult him you
gotta dog him you gotta humiliate him
do whatever you got to do to get him into
that ring but thats what you got to do

the measure of a man
by elton john
these battered hands are all you own
this broken heart thats turned to stone
go hang your glory on the wall
there comes a time when castles fall
and all thats left is shifting in the sand
youre out of time youre out of place
look at your face
thats the measure of a man
this coat that fits you like a glove
these dirty streets you learn to love
so welcome back my long lost friend
youve been to hell and back again
and god alone knows
how you crossed that span
back on the beat back to the start
trusting your heart
thats the measure of a man
its the fire in the eyes
the lines on the hand
its the things you understand
permanent ties
from which you once ran
thats the measure of a man
youve come full circle
now youre home
without the gold without the chrome
and this is where youve always been
you had to lose so you could win
and rise above your troubles
while you can
now you can love now you can lose
now you can choose
and thats the measure of a man
its the fire in the eyes
the lines on the hand
its the things you understand
the permanent ties
from which you once ran
thats the measure of a man
youve come full circle
now youre home
without the gold without the chrome
and this is where youve always been
you had to lose so you could win
and rise above your troubles
