 adrian  you deserve the worst
for what you did 
  that was rocky s money 
  you wanna be hysterical 
  you cost us everything 
  it was a mistake 
you think i thought
this was gonna happen 
don t you walk away from me 
you just gave up our life 
and you think it s some stupid thing 
paulie  do you know what you did 
do you know the seriousness of it 
i understand it 
i understand the whole freakin  thing 
i understand it 
your accountant s a crook  not me 
i did what i thought was right 
don t blame me 
i want to murder the bum
worse than anybody 
adrian  what s wrong 
look what you done now 
she s dumpin  it all on me 
  come on  don t turn this around on me 
  what did you do 
he gave power of attorney
to our accountant 
i just didn t gave anything to nobody 
he sent a letter  he says
 we ll be in russia a couple of months   
   and i need rocky
to sign a tax extension  
that extension was
a power of attorney  paulie 
he s the thief  i need alcohol 
rocky  on my eyes 
i never stole a freakin  dime 
adrian  what s happenin  here 
  it s gone 
  what s gone 
the money  the money 
everything  it s all gone 
the piece of paper paulie had you sign
wasn t a request for a tax extension 
it was a blanket power of attorney
in favour of the accountant   
   who was involved in
some high priced real estate 
he thought he could have your money
back before you knew it was gone 
unfortunately for you
and everybody in this room   
   his deals fell through because the
market dried up  and you lost millions 
  ain t there nothin  i can do 
  i ve filed eight criminal acts against him 
but you ve got debt payment
on this property   
   he didn t pay your tax returns and your
mortgage hasn t been paid in months 
we didn t have a mortgage 
our house was fully paid for 
  don t take it from me  ask him 
  there s nearly  400 000 outstanding 
the only thing that s not encumbered
is a gym  willed to your son   
   by a mickey goldmill in 1982 
you can sell things 
remember those commercials you did 
i ain t no commercial kinda guy 
i m a fighter  that s what i do 
nah  we couldn t get sponsors 
with the investigation of the accountant   
   out pops a criminal record
of rocky s for assault 
but that was a long time ago 
he didn t know   
why not a couple more fights  with
your popularity  you d be out in no time 
  he s retiring 
  rocko  fightin s the ticket 
i said he s retired 
paulie  we re here because of you 
i m not taking the heat for all this 
i thought i was doing smart business 
  you thought you did smart business  
  hey  the accountant was your choice 
you shoulda known he was a thief  but in
your fairy tale world the air don t move 
  you re like a season that don t change 
  hey  enough 
  i m not no tomato can you kick around 
  paulie  no 
you call duke  tell him i ll fight cane 
i don t care  anywhere  any time 
  no  rocky  no 
  if that s what you want  i ll get on it 
  rocky  please 
  a couple of fights  we re outta trouble 
  yeah  but you said   
  no  i didn t say anything 
  did we come this far to lose it 
  you have to see a doctor 
  i don t need a doctor  i need a promoter 
  if the doctor says ok  i ll support you 
i gotta fight  ok 
i got problems  i gotta fight 
will you do it for me 
all right  for you 
because of continuous
violent blows to the head   
   you have a condition particular to boxers
called cavum septum pellucidum   
   which is a hole in the membrane
separating the ventricles 
the brain surface neurons in this area
have also been traumatised 
simply stated  mr balboa  it means you ve
suffered some damage to the brain 
   adrian  how long until he recovers 
  the effects are irreversible 
oh  i   
rocky  you    you have to retire 
i don t wanna retire  this ain t the time
to retire  not in here  not in no office 
i just fought the best fight of my life 
i just did that  you know 
  and all i need is    a couple more 
  no  you suffered severe brain trauma 
he could be wrong 
anybody could be wrong 
he ain t god 
adrian  only god ain t wrong 
  rocky  this is what s good for you 
  i only need a couple of easy ones 
not the way it is  you can t get licensed
in any state  he can t  can he  doctor 
  that is correct 
  rocky  do you love me 
  yeah  i love you  why do you ask that 
  because if you love somebody   
   you live with them  you live for them 
you don t gamble with a life 
rocky  i don t care about the money 
it s you 
that s all that matters 
please  we ll be ok  we ll be fine 
 whispers 
uh   
  no one has to know  doctor  right 
  it ll be strictly confidential

   hey  i probably wouldn t be alive today 
the fact that you re here and doin 
as well as you re doin  gives me   
what do you call it 
a motivisation to stay alive 
cos i think that people die sometimes
when they don t wanna live no more 
nature s smarter than people think

deadly punches

he used to drink a lot  seriously 
he d go out with his friends  then
he d come home  look to punch on me

so growin  up 
i only thought about fightin  my father 
you know  when i was 13 
i got in trouble at school 
he tied me down and whipped me
so bad i couldn t walk for a week 
i couldn t do anything 
the first guy i ever knocked out was my

  have a good time with uncle paulie 
  yeah 
let me present the newest  the youngest
heavyweight champion of all time   
   tommy  the machine  gunn 
  do you think it was too easy 
  i took some shots  but i was never hurt 
i m just glad to be the champ 
don t you think this looked like more like
a sparring session than a championship 
  it didn t look like you broke a sweat 
  very observant 
union cane wasn t feeling that good 
but tommy gunn would have done
the same thing if union was 100  
100    he fought like
he didn t have a heartbeat 
we all know cane is a paper champion 
  what do you mean 
  cane s title was manufactured 
  he never won it from balboa 
  gentlemen  give him a break 
will you ever get out
from underneath balboa s shadow 
  i won the title  what more do you want 
  you ve gotta fight some real opponents 
but i beat the best tonight 
the best  this guy s a bum 
he doesn t even deserve a title shot 
gentlemen  whoa  we re gettin  carried
away  cane was the recognised champ 
we know the ratings system
can be manipulated 
fact is  tommy gunn
beat a second rate fighter   
   with so much glass in his jaw 
he oughta be a chandelier 
this man will prove
to be a great champion 
he might win a few fights 
but a rocky balboa he ll never be 
no  he s no rocky balboa 
let s face it  there s only one balboa 
he was a true people s champion 
but in time tommy gunn may be
able to fill his shoes  next question 
  not by fighting stiffs like cane  he won t 
  i ll fight anybody  anywhere 
when are you gonna fight a real fighter 
gentlemen  come on  thank you for
coming tonight  we look forward to   
hey  tommy  i got somethin  for ya 
for your next fight  try the redhead in the
front row  i hear she comes real cheap 
we look forward to seeing you
at tommy gunn s next fight 
why did you say balboa s better 
do you believe that

the damn title and they think i m a bum 
  why didn t you back me up 
  when the press is right  they re right 
i m as good as balboa ever was and
i m tired of being called a damn robot 
listen  tommy  you can t fight the press 
i can t fight them 
as long as they got balboa on the brain 
he s champ  he fought wars in the ring 
tommy  face facts  you re in his shadow 
  this is your own man talking 
  listen to me 
there is a way to get the respect
you deserve  challenge balboa to fight 
  george could set it up in just weeks 
  it d be the greatest fight ever 
teacher against student 
old lion against young lion 
that s the only way
you ever gonna get peace of mind 
that press will hound you with that man s
legend for as long as you wear gloves 
you gotta get him into that ring  tommy 
or you ll keep hearing questions like that 
then you ll start to ask yourself
 could i take him  am i good enough  
 do people think i m a carbon copy   
   or a second rate pretender who only
got a shot because of my skin tone  
got to challenge
that man to fight  tommy 
if he refuses  you gotta insult him  you
gotta dog him  you gotta humiliate him 
do whatever you got to do to get him into
that ring  but that s what you got to do 
 rocky  ok  blast off

     the measure of a man 
by elton john 
  these battered hands are all you own
  this broken heart that s turned to stone
  go hang your glory on the wall
  there comes a time when castles fall
  and all that s left is shifting in the sand
  you re out of time  you re out of place
  look at your face
  that s the measure of a man
  this coat that fits you like a glove
  these dirty streets you learn to love
  so welcome back  my long lost friend
  you ve been to hell and back again
  and god alone knows
how you crossed that span
  back on the beat  back to the start
  trusting your heart
  that s the measure of a man
  it s the fire in the eyes 
the lines on the hand
  it s the things you understand
  permanent ties
from which you once ran
  that s the measure of a man
  you ve come full circle 
now you re home
  without the gold  without the chrome
  and this is where you ve always been
  you had to lose so you could win
  and rise above your troubles
while you can
  now you can love  now you can lose
  now you can choose
  and that s the measure of a man
  it s the fire in the eyes 
the lines on the hand
  it s the things you understand
  the permanent ties
from which you once ran
  that s the measure of a man
  you ve come full circle 
now you re home
  without the gold  without the chrome
  and this is where you ve always been
  you had to lose so you could win
  and rise above your troubles
