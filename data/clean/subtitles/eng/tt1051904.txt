but it offered refuge from
the real terrors
that lurked outside 
you wish 
he found us 
quickly  follow me 
papa  you left
without saying goodbye 
trying to hide from me 
that s like hiding
from yourself 
i was your best friend 
and you turned your back on me 
locked me up  imprisoned me
in the pages of a book 
slappys  in unison  
you stuck me on a shelf

zach closed his eyes 
and the monsters
were swallowed
back into the world
of paper and ink
