go to city for a while 
you chicken fink 
wait a minute 
after all we went through
to get accepted 
we re finally getting
out of this turkey town 
and now you want to crawl
back into your cell  right 
you want to end up
like john 
you just can t
stay 17 forever 
curt  it s just   
you ve got to get that through your head 
i just need some time 
i ve got to go talk to laurie 
now take it  take it 
now  we re leaving in
the morning  all right 
we re leaving
in the morning 
wolfman on radio  we re gonna rock
and roll ourselves to death  baby 
you got
the wolfman jack show 
 slow pop song playing 
don t   
don t with the thing 
will you stop it with
the big bopper stuff 
 horn honking 
girl  hi  john 
hi  john 
john  not too good  huh 
why is it every girl
that comes around here
is ugly 
or has a boyfriend 
where is
the dazzling beauty
i ve been searching for
all my life 
yeah  i know
what you mean 
the pickings are
really getting slim 
the whole strip
is shrinking 
i remember about
five years ago 
take you
a couple of hours and
a tank full of gas
just to make one circuit 
it was really something 
 engine revving 
hey  john 
someone new in town 
 exclaims 
you gonna go after him 
hey  listen  professor 
if he can t find me  then he
ain t even worth racing  right 
big shot 
 john laughs 
well 
 yawns 
where was i 
how you thought high
school romances were goofy
and we started
going together
just because you thought i
was kind of cute and funny 
but then you suddenly realized
you were in love with me 
it was serious  and   
oh  you were leading up
to something kind of big 
you make it sound like
i m giving dictation 
 laughs 
well  seriously 
what i meant was that since we
do care for each other so much 
and since we should really
consider ourselves as adults now 
i   
could i have a couple
of those fries 
terry  come on  budda 
come on 
steve  where was i 
laurie   consider ourselves adults 
  right  right 
i thought maybe 
before i leave 
we could agree
that seeing other
people while i m away
can t possibly hurt 
you know 
you mean
dating other people 
i think it would strengthen
our relationship 
then we d know for sure
that we re really in love 
not that
there s any doubt 
i think you re right 
i mean 
we re not kids anymore 
and it s silly to think that
when we re 3 000 miles apart 
we shouldn t be able to see
other people and go out 
laurie  listen  i didn t
ask for that back 
i know  i just sort of
think it s juvenile now 
i ll keep it at home 
it s less conspicuous there 
you don t want to wear it 
i didn t say that 
i understand 
and i m not upset 
i mean 
i can t expect you
to be a monk or something
while you re away 
and i got a really neat
record collection 
i even got pledging my
love by johnny ace 
look  how can
you love nelson
when he s going out
with marilyn gator 
since he dumped
on you  i was   
he didn t dump on me 
you little dip 
oh  hi  steve 
hey

that i m gonna let you
