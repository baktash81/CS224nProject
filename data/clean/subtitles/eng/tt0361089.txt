oh  valiant 
well i have to   
return to my duties  so   
good bye 
but valiant  wait 
as homing pigeons it s our
duty to transport messages 
in the worst of conditions 
wind  rain  sleet  snow 
bombs exploding  bullets flying
and as if that weren t enough 
mother nature has the audacity
to create a little something called   
the falcon 
20 pounds of pigeon eating muscle 
measuring five of your wing spans 
they like to blind side their prey 
at speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour 
but not to bite  not yet 
the first strike is merely for impact 
they ll let you drop of it 
making sure you re defenseless  and
scoop you up in their razor sharp talons 
and in the dark of the night  you ll
have but a split second to recognize   
friend from foe 
friend or foe 
  foe    foe 
  no 
you idiots  it s a pigeon 
friend or foe 
  foe  no  friend 
  that s friend  or maybe   
  no  it s a foe 
  ah  yes  yes 
friend or foe 
  friend 
  friend  oh  yes  my friend 
99  100 
101 
102 
to survive his mission  a pigeon must have
the strength to carry his message capsule 
he must have the speed
to fly like the wind 
evasive action 
he must have the agility   
to outmaneuver the enemy 
and he must have the endurance
to battle the elements 
flying long distances over raging seas 
  me again 
  valiant 
my favorite 
how did you know 
the parrot says to me
 how about we do a loop to loop  
i said   i can t do a loop to loop  
he says   why ever not

with a more critical or dangerous mission 
may you fly straight  and may
your instinct guide you home

don t get involved with anything
called  highly dangerous  
and i will never violate my core beliefs
