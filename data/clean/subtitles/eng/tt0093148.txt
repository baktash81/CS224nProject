you hit a bigfoot with your car

in your kitchen 
look  i m under
a lot of stress here 
i mean  it wasn t dead anymore  it must
have just walked into the kitchen 
it was eating
out of our refrigerator 
i thought it was gonna eat me  but it
ate my daughter s corsage instead 
and then our passiflora coriacea
and then it ate our goldfish 
and where is it now  mr  henderson 
it s in the bathroom 
of course  how stupid of me 
hey  look  just say i believe you

first we cordon off
your neighborhood 
second  we evacuate your neighbors 
and third  we send a whole
shit load of cops in there
to deal with the thing  i mean  fully
armed and ready  mr  henderson 
so unless you wanna
be responsible
for wrongfully turning your
neighborhood into a war zone
i suggest you drop this
whole thing right now

no  no  no bigfoot here 
sergeant  i was just joking

hey  hang on  i thought we were
gonna sell it  and get rich 
let s keep it and get rich 
exactly 
 growling 
i don t believe this family  sorry 
we are talking about a living 
breathing being here 
it might even be
some kind of a person 
it s a bigfoot person 
we don t even know what it is 
we don t know
if it s male or female 
definitely male 
how can you tell 
oh  don t answer that  honey 
never mind 
nan  i don t know how  but we gotta
figure a way to keep this thing 
it s big bucks  don t you see 
i mean  it s a ticket
to a better life 
a better life for whom

i m thinking about us 
i just need time
to figure away to   
oh  well 
at least he s safe here 
lafleur  you should not have
given up  my old friend 
the only difference
between these and those
is i get a buck a strand for mine 
these are real  doc 
i chased a set of tracks
for two or three miles 
okay  jocko  if you ve got
castings  i ll buy them 
but let s keep the price
on the ground 
listen  you don t understand 
i almost had him 
i was that close 
then what  gun jam 
or maybe a change of heart 
had him in your sights
and couldn t do it 
what s the story this time 
i don t know 
i think he was hit by a car 
that should have made it easy 
yes  i know but   
there are no traces 
no tracks  nothing 
he just vanished 
well  like i tell my customers 
bigfoot eat their dead 
i don t know why the
hell i bother with you 
because you figure i m the only one
who deep down wants to believe you 
but i don t 
not any more 
we both spent our whole lives
chasing after that beast 
and we both have to stare at
ourselves in the mirror every morning
and keep repeating 
 i m not a fool  
 i am not a fool  
only you finally blinked 
or finally opened my eyes 
we ll find out soon enough 
go for it  jocko

george  those are
just empty calories 
never mind about that 
no  no  no  no

to show you 
but first  i want you to think
about this just for a moment 
us 
life 
time 
magazines  cover stories 
i mean  you could be looking at old dad
on the carson show  for heaven s sake 
no  no  no  no

george  you are acting
like a crazy person 
honey  that wasn t
supposed to happen 
none of this was
supposed to happen 
but it did  and now we have
to do the right thing 
i know it seems bad  but
just give me one more week 
we don t have enough house
for two days 
george  he doesn t fit here 
he doesn t fit in our lives 
look  we have to do the right
thing and think about him 
mom  dad  hurry  this is great 
 sighing 
man on tv 
what s the matter with him 
woman 
maybe he thinks you re getting   
 laughing 
now watch this 
 chair creaking 
cool  huh 
he didn t care for the blue cheese

like a good boy   
and you ll have
swedish pancake too 
now i know where
bonzo get his bad habits 
that s outright bribery 
okay 
i ll take him back 
but you know
it might not be so easy 
i think he likes it here 
what kind of a way
is that to talk to a baby 
what do you mean 
she s gone 
it s time to go 
remember this 
your favorite station wagon 
right  what s left of it 
 roaring

you were the first one to see that 
he deserves to be free 
mom s right 
he s gotta go back
where he belongs

mistaken for a mouse  
hawthorne hills 
a mouse 
a mouse

silly old jerry seville 
if there really was a bigfoot  don t you think

years driving along the freeway

out where he lives  it s fantastic 
ten bucks 
 men laughing 
so how about you  george

hell  looks like we got
one of those right here

thank you 
good morning 
hi 
i am called richard smith 
and i m from
the u s  forestry service
and i m investigating a possible
road kill  with an animal
either killed or maimed
in a car accident 
now  i know that you did
hit something on route a 4
which was a little fire road
off the i 90 
yes  we did run into something 
 sniffing 
what was it that you hit 
mrs  henderson 
i don t know 
we couldn t see it 
you know  it happened so fast 
where is it now 
now  i don t know 
it ran away 
mrs  henderson  obviously  our
main concern are for your family 
to be sure no one was injured 
no one was injured 
i m so pleased 
obviously our other concern is for the
safety of that poor little animal 
it could be out there suffering
and i know you would want to help
me find it so i could care for it 
no  i mean  yes 
but i mean 
there s nothing wrong with it 
it walked into the woods 
i mean  it didn t even limp 
walked 
it crawled  it scurried 
you know  it scampered 
it kind of wobbled  creeped 
like an animal does  you know 
anyway  he s fine 
and we are fine and   
you know   
i forgot i have a sink backed up and i   
and a potty 
i ve gotta go take care of it 
thank you 
thanks very much for thinking
of us and bringing this to us 
and thanks for your consideration 
license plates  huh  that guy s
probably a convict  here 
what you don t need now
is somebody bothering you 
just sit back and relax 
i can remember herb s and my first fight 
this is nothing 
can i help you 
probably not 
this is the first
place i have been 
i want some  458 magnums 
i think we got those
in here somewhere 
yeah  here we are 
we don t get much
call for these monsters 
 28 50 for the box 
do you have any more 
there s 20 of them in there 
you know 
do you have any more 
i m sorry  that s the last we got 
what  are you going
on safari or something 
no  just into my own back yard 
there he goes  just like clockwork 
jeez  dad 
who the hell is that guy 
jacques lafleur 
he s always the first to show when
these crazy sightings start up 
he bought some
pretty serious ammo   458s 
before sasquatch got under his
skin he was a class a hunter 
where do you think claws came from 
that guy shot claws 
yeah 
why would he part
with a trophy like that 
probably because
it was the smallest one 
may i help you 
yes  i m on my lunch break
and i m kind of in a hurry 
could you point me
to some books on the   
 whispering  bigfoot 
sasquatch 
sasquatch 
sasquatch 
that s the one 
fantasy  folklore 
myths and legends 
basement stacks  take the stairs 
thank you 
you could also try children s books 
right 
this book sucks 
ernie 
these pictures don t look
anything like harry 
he s right  nan  it s no
wonder people wanna kill them 
these books make them
out to be monsters 
all except this journal from the north
american anthropological institute 
some guy named wallace wrightwood 
nancy  that s him 
no  that s jacques lafleur 
he s a hunter who came
into the store today 
no  honey 
this is richard smith 
the forestry guy i told you about
who came to our house today 
that lying bastard 
sarah and ernie  mom 
both of you  to bed  right now 
sarah  get off that phone  it s two hours 
come on  that s it 
mom  it s only 8 30 
you mind your mother 
 horn honking 
hard to believe  huh 
and from the look in your mug  you
think it s a load  don t you 
everybody asks 
 has anybody ever seen one  
let me ask you 
you being a flatlander 
a city fellow 
you ve seen hundreds 
thousands of pigeons  right 
of course 
have you ever seen a baby pigeon 
well  neither have i 
but i got a hunch they exist 
are you dr  wrightwood 
i m george henderson 
wrightwood ain t here 
is he coming back 
he might 
could i leave a message for   
how do you know wrightwood 
his books  and his research 
he seems to be the only person
who really believes in all this 
i just need a few answers 
doctor s old  tired 
i m gonna put
my phone number down here 
could you see
that the doctor gets this 
 vital facts that could prevent
an unnecessary and tragic end
 for the big fellow  
i have a friend 
a man named jack 
and say there was this 
this  giant   
ls there a beanstalk involved
in this  mr  henderson 
a beanstalk 
no  no 
i mean  with all
these bigfoot sightings
what if jack and his family
opened up their home
and their lives to this thing 
and  what if they found out that
he was more human than animal 
and they just said 
 we ll take him in 
 we ll accept responsibility for him until
a safe place can be found for him to be  
not some zoo  or lab   
so what you re saying is
you would be willing   
excuse me  jack would be willing
to take this creature in 
care for it and love it like a pet 
no  no 
like a member of the family 
that s a noble gesture 
but impossible 
sasquatch is a primitive
ancestor of modern man 
but if you ever came
face to face with one
you d see that they re still
very much animals 
only on the outside 
look  i know what
i m talking about 
and i know it s closing time so if
you wanna talk shop  then shop 
jack and the beanstalk 
george 
it just came out like that  i
didn t know what i was saying 
i think you knew
exactly what you were saying 
face it  dad  you want him back 
sarah  i want to take him back
where he belongs 
but that means
i ve gotta find him first 
by bringing harry here
we put his life in danger 
now  we ve got to
try to set things right 
george 
this is really harry 
did you draw that 
yeah 
nancy  it s beautiful 
 growling 
man  hey  hey  fella  get away
from that window 
 screaming 
 reporters chattering 
woman  he s the person who saw it 
now get this 
 it must have been the large hairy
giant he saw running from the scene  
did you get that  george 
yeah 
george  do you still
fool with that painting stuff 
yeah 
as a matter of fact  i   
good 
you can save your old man
a few bucks 
how about you draw
a big full size bigfoot 
we ll put it in the window
right next to the gun section 
now  you make him real big 
you know  real scary 
you know  like they re
supposed to be  george 
hands up  big claws 
big fangs  a lot of drool 
and let s put up a map of the area 
and we ll mark on it all the spots where
people say they ve seen the thing 
we ll become kind of like
a bigfoot central  a b h q 
dad  don t you think we might be
encouraging a lot of unqualified people
to go running around
with loaded weapons 
come on  you know as well as i do
there s nothing out there to shoot at 
this is the first time my dad ever wanted
me to draw anything and what is it 
a target for a bunch of
blood thirsty crackpots 
come to bed 
no  really  it s the same old story 
one christmas  when i was a kid 
i begged him all fall
for a set of paints 
he ends up giving me a bb gun 
like you got ernie 
yeah 
come to bed 
no 
honey  i can t 
i gotta finish this 
what s the problem 
if i make him look
mean and vicious 
people are gonna shoot first and
then worry about the consequences 
it s like drawing a  wanted 
poster of your best friend 
but if i make him look peaceful 
the way harry really is   
well  that s just not
what my father wants 
george  i m so proud of you 
you don t know what to do 
if your father wants a bigfoot 
give him a bigfoot 
i wanted king kong  you brought
me a goddamn giant gerbil 
i told you exactly what to do 
you didn t even come close 
well  maybe it s right on the nose 
i mean  how do we know 
maybe it s not vicious at all 
maybe it s gentle 
even has feelings 
where did you dream up that shit 
go stick a pin in queen anne s hill 
we just got another sighting 
should have got a real artist 
 people chattering 
man  i need one of those
clint eastwood magnums 
you got an m 16 
anything that ll go
fully automatic 
fully automatic is illegal and it
takes seven days to clear a handgun 
i m afraid if you want a gun right now
it ll have to be a rifle or a shotgun 
anything with a night scope 
give me the biggest one you got 
well  we ve got some big guns
and some big  big guns 
but i m afraid we re all out
of big  big ammo  who s next 
look  pal  they just spotted that
thing not three blocks from my house 
where do you live 
what for 
it s for the gun 
where do you live

on the corner of maple and ogilvy 
what the hell s
that got to do with it

the only artist in the family 
how s that for
an arthritic old shooter  huh

it was my drawing 
why did you change it

 police radio chattering

to take a statement

now just calm down and
tell me what happened 
okay  i m okay 
i brought my poor ten speed
to a complete stop
like i always do at stop signs 
when out of nowhere
this humungous hairy thing
is standing right
in front of me  growling 
with these enormous fangs and these
giant hands  and he grabs me 
and he picks me up 
bike and all  over his head
then he smashes me down on the
cement and now he s all over me 
and he s snarling with saliva
dripping off his pointed teeth 
so i grab my mace   
what  mace  you idiot 
cop  stand back 
i didn t really mace him 
i was about to be eaten 
eaten  by a vegetarian 
all right  that s it  officers

but what really happened is
when you saw him 
you were so scared shitless that you
crashed your precious ten speed

 loud pop music playing 
 music stops 
 growling 
as you probably know  your dad paid me
a visit the other day at my museum 
i liked him 
what i m gonna say now
just might save his life 
i don t understand 
when i was younger i used to have a
good job working as a lab scientist 
life was great 
and then something happened on a
hunting trip darn near 50 years ago
that let the air out of everything 
i went out for a walk
one day in the woods 
i heard a rustle behind me 
then i smelled something
that made my eyes water
and my lungs smoke 
by the time i turned around
all i saw was a streak of fur 
on the ground
there was a footprint 
a big footprint 
so  i was hooked
from that moment on 
i started spending all the time i
could spare searching for the beast 
then i spent time i couldn t spare 
that s how i lost my job
and my friends 
it s so sad 
well  i didn t tell it so you
could cry in your sprouts 
or whatever that is  darling 
i m telling it so that your father
won t make the same mistake 
i appreciate what you re
saying  dr  wrightwood 
but there s a big difference
between your story and mine 
not as big as you think 
maybe even bigger 
 george clears throat 
no  no  no  you re kidding yourself 
i remember what you told me
when you came into my shop 
bigfoot can come live with us 
we ll accept the responsibility 
can you imagine what a bigfoot
would do to your home 
yeah  well  i can 
you re good people 
i m gonna say this once 
i m gonna say it simple and i hope to
god for your sakes you all listen 
there are no abominable snowmen 
there are no sasquatches 
there are no bigfeet 
am i missing something

enemy to anything wondrous 
even the scientific community s
