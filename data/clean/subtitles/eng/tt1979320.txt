so uncertain
the drivers prepare for
the track is still dangerously wet
but following a drivers meeting
a decision has finally been taken
three minutes to go
everybody off the grid now
twentyfive drivers
start every season in formula 1
and each year two of us die
what kind of person
does a job like this
not normal men for sure
rebels lunatics dreamers
people who are desperate to make a mark
and are prepared to die trying
my name is niki lauda
and racing people
know me for two things
the first is my rivalry with him
photographers
please clear the grid
what about hunt has he changed
no hes going on wets
i dont know
why it became such a big thing
we were just drivers
busting each others balls
to me this is perfectly normal
but other people saw it differently
that whatever it was between us
went deeper
the other thing im remembered for
is what happened on 1st august 1976
when i was chasing him
like an asshole
trauma trolley please
hello i think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that i was coming
hunt james hunt
whats the matter no one ever seen
a spot of blood before
are you all right
absolutely fine
we all thought
youd been in an accident
i have
if you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident
what did you disagree about
its none of your business
sorry
his wife
thats going to need a couple
of stitches its a nasty cut
it was a nasty blow
done with a bloody crowbar
why what did you do
nothing
only what she asked me to do
which was
id be happy to show you if you like
oh sorry
i have a theory
why women like racing drivers
its not because
they respect what we do
driving round and round in circles
mostly they think thats pathetic
and theyre probably right
its our closeness to death
you see the closer you are to death
the more alive you feel
the more alive you are
and they can see that in you
they feel that in you
my name is james hunt
my father is a stockbroker
my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant
and i
well i do this
its a wonderful way to live
its the only way to drive
as if each day is your last
ive never been to a grand prix before
oh you still havent
this is formula 3
whats that
its a lower division
where idiots like me mess about
in the hope of being talentspotted
to race in formula 1
you look disappointed
no
ah you only slept with me
because you thought i was famous
thats not true
dont worry i will be one day
morning everyone
this is nursie
gemma
nursie this is bubbles horsley
team manager
how do you do
bubbles
yeah
doc postlethwaite our designer

lotus 59
1000cc cosworth mae engine

drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now
all right superstar
never better patron
have a gargle with this
thank you
quick toke of this
at crystal palace today
james hunts on pole
with austrian newcomer
niki lauda alongside him
and dave walker completing row 1
row 2 is mike beuttler and dave morgan
with tony trimmer and gerry birrell
whos that
hes new
some german
austrian
hes been here since 500 am
walking the track
you might actually
have to concentrate today james
youll need these
okay start her up
ah what music
they could never have imagined it
those pioneers
who invented the automobile
that it would possess us like this
in our imaginations in our dreams
nursie men love women
but even more than that
men love cars
come on james
james come on james
go james
hunts still in the lead
but niki lauda is right on his tail
hunt and lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own
theyre leaving the pack far behind
herr red devils on his tail
lauda takes a look down the inside
and hes sold him a dummy
lauda is through hes in the lead
hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake
hunts in laudas slipstream
laudas not leaving any gap
the lotus goes for the inside
its an aggressive move from hunt
oh theres contact
the leaders have spun out
laudas facing the wrong way
the back markers gone through
you can see why hunts fellow drivers
call him hunt the shunt
asshole
go on james
the krauts out of it
lauda is clearly furious
theres every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits
its gonna be victory for hunt
its gonna be an ignominious defeat
for niki lauda
so james hunt scores his
third major formula 3 win of the season
here at crystal palace
after a desperate battle
with niki lauda
lauda was unable to restart
after hunts aggressive move
caused them both to spin out
in the last lap of the race
hard luck
better luck next time
hey asshole
that was my line i had that corner
do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way
i think that corner had you
that move was total suicide
what if i hadnt braked
wed have crashed
but we didnt did we
thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts
fuck you whats your name
james simon wallis hunt
remember it my little jerry friend
jawohl remember ze name
and its very simple hunt
it rhymes with
cunt
a word that happens
to describe you perfectly
who was that
ive no idea
he looks like a rat doesnt he
in my home town vienna
my family is famous
for one thing  business
my grandfather was a businessman
my father too
so when they heard i wanted
to race cars for a living
they had a few things to say
gut
so if my family
wasnt going to help me
i decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself
i found a formula 1 team
with an okay car
and an owner who had run out of money
and was willing to accept my terms
and so
ladies and gentlemen
im delighted to say
that the winner of the guild of motoring
writers award driver of the year
is james hunt
superb news
well done james
superstar
fantastic
well done congratulations
thank you so much
yes
erm
you know my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor
or a stockbroker or something
they gave me the firstclass education
but well that all went terribly wrong
and i ended up with you lot
thank you i need it more than you do
i mean i have a hot head
an inability to tolerate discipline
yes
very true
i fall out with people left and right
the only creatures ive ever really
loved or have treated honourably
are budgerigars
so in any normal area of life id be
or i am a total liability
the only thing ive got going for me
is im quick in a car
so thank you for this
and for acknowledging that
im going to give it to my father
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece
and imagine its a firstclass degree
in medicine
well done superstar
another season like that
and ill move you up to the big time
come on you dont think im ready now
you are im not
ive got to find you a car first
well go on then chopchop
dont wait too long you dont want him
to do what lauda just did
why what did he do
got himself a drive with brm
well how the hell did he do that
hes a nobody
hes never won a bloody thing
apparently took out a loan
and bought his way in
with two million austrian schillings
jesus
niki lauda
here for preseason testing brm
sign the release form
ill let them know youre here
mr stanley
good morning
good morning
good morning clay
let me introduce you
to our numberone driver
clay regazzoni
how are you
good
pleasure
and these are your mechanics
theyre reporting exclusively to you
as per contract
pleasure do you wanna see the car
sure
hello
there she is p160
same as regazzonis
identical in every detail
how much does she weigh
600 kilos
but thats crazy
why so heavy
its a v12 engine
that lump weighs 190k on its own
okay
what horsepower are you getting 490
no no 450
well its not enough
it needs to be 500
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter
we already tried
tried what
everything
we replaced the entire exhaust system
barely made a difference
are you using magnesium parts
now the engine block
any mounting or fixing plates
strip it out also
when youve done that
we have to look at the aerodynamics
front and rear wing
okay thank you good night
what was regazzonis time
okay now put him in my car
and hell go round two seconds faster
well thats impossible
no chance
weve been working on it all night
put regazzoni in the car
see what happens
i dont understand
why am i supposed to do this
i dont know clay
he just wants you to take it for a spin
gloves please
fanculo
i would say we push it a bit
all right
what did you do to the car
thats information i will share with you
under certain conditions only
go on
a guaranteed place in the team
and a paid contract on equal terms
with regazzoni for two years
are you crazy
clays a senior figure in formula 1
youre just a rookie
well the only reason we took you on
is because youre paying us
well as of now if you want me to stay
we rip up the contract
i dont pay you a cent
thats outrageous
was he quicker in my car
he was wasnt he
did he go two seconds faster
so have a think
work out your priorities
and get back to me
hey niki
i know what youre going to say
that its none of my business
what
if its the track manager
youre taking on your date tonight
its none of your business
okay but if you want my advice
id let this one go
im not questioning your taste
she is a great girl but
agness last boyfriend
was a british formula 2 driver
who has a reputation for two things
for being a little crazy on the track
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed
hes a good driver
but an immortal fuck apparently
i dont know about you but
thats not an act id like to follow
but if that doesnt bother you
whats his name the driver
hunt james hunt
you see you share information
and i share information
thats what teammates are for
where the hell are we going
i promise
itll be worth it
just keep them closed
wait for it
wait for it
there what do you say
shes formula 1
yes she is superstar
your brother and i got together
with the bean counters
and since the economics of f1
are not so significantly different
to the economics of formula 2
well we thought if we were
going to be losing money
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in formula 1
you fat little inbred beauty
come here
actually credit where its due
we got the idea from niki
who
lauda
bought his way in rather than
mess about in the lower divisions
i thought bloody hell hes right
no sponsorship superstar
i hope you approve
no vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms
just plain white with the flags ooh
and racing overalls which read
sex breakfast of champions
so when do we start
soon as youre ready
ready
ive been waiting for this
my whole life
hi welcome to watkins glen
hello
when the season started
people wondered
whether lord hesketh and his team
of upperclass enthusiasts
were bringing glamour
to the racing community or just comedy
certainly it was the first time
anyone had seen
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits
but they have made quite an impact
sixth in france fourth in britain
and third in holland
ah drivers on the track
caution flags are out
a severe crash at the esses
red flag
there is a car off the track
and reports are reaching me
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying
er the identity of the driver we dont
currently have at the moment
but as you can tell
from all the activity
going on behind me towards the track
it is clearly a grave incident indeed
we will of course
have more information for you
as and when we get it
but it is the sight and sound
of formula 1 nobody likes to see
get your hands off me
hey come on
drivers of top stature
weve lost just in the past four seasons
have included piers courage
jochen rindt
jo siffert roger williamson
and today at watkins glen
formula 1 has claimed another driver
the tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race
their places on the grid
will be left empty
terrible
they should cancel the race
why
he made a mistake
went into the corner too fast
its his fault
is that right
its obvious
look at the tyre marks
so says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive
hows that working out for you
by the way
fine how is it at the back
not planning on being there for long
ten minutes to the warmup lap
ten minutes
arsehole
heading into
the grand hotel hairpin second gear
turn in hard
looking for late apex
gentle with the bar
heading into portier second gear
clip the apex
light brake stay in second
looking for a good exit
heading through the tunnel
gradual right
up through third fourth fifth
ls alexander round
er yes he was
he went back to the house
to take a call
hell be back shortly
he only wanted to show me
his pride and joy
rhymes with boy if you ask me
and toy
god its so flimsy
for something that costs so much
theres no comfort
no protection nothing
no its just a little coffin really
surrounded by highoctane fuel in here
being driven round 170 miles per hour
to all intents and purposes
this things a bomb on wheels
youre james arent you
yes
you fit the description
is that right
suzy friend of alexs
yeah yeah i know exactly
what was the description
mostly positive
in terms of appearance
negative only in terms of character
ive been told to avoid you
by whom
alexander he says youre a bad boy
alexander doesnt know
what hes talking about
i was im not any more
the new me is very professional
early to bed early to rise
all very dull
hmm
but according to the team
the best way to
keep beating the goosestepper
is that what you were doing
when i came in
yes visualisation techniques
memorising the circuit
in this case monaco which is up next
personally ive always been a great
believer in getting there on the day
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else
but they dont want me
doing that any more
they want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk
and what about your soul your heart
well theyve got ideas about that too
they want me to stop messing around
settle down
get married
with the next nice girl i meet
they think it would be good for me
hmm what do you think
it sounds fucking awful
but since theyre right
about most things
theyre probably right about that too
hmm
you dont fancy getting married do you
suzy
bravo
hey hey hey
whats going on with him
nothing nothing
didnt want to ruin your day
its its the kraut
what about him
hes just been signed by ferrari
youre kidding me
jesus how did that happen
did he buy his way in there too
well the old man took regazzoni back
and he insisted on it apparently
he says that nikis a genius
setting up the cars
its terrible drives like a pig
oh you cant say that
why not
its a ferrari
its a shitbox
it understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster
its amazing all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this
uh
ferrari family
our good friend clay regazzoni
you are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win
the minute you dont ciao ciao
i totally understand its business
i would do the same
but it isnt
just business is it what we do
its passion love
which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it
not me
if i had more talent and could earn
better money with something else
i would
how do you know you will
make money here you havent yet
not yet but i will
if you can i can
you know are you ever not an asshole
why am i an asshole
well
you know by now
im both quicker than you
and better at setting up the car
you cant deal with it
so youre the asshole
screw you
i brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy
i thought if i introduced you
to some nice people
that could rub off on you
forget it make your own friends
come on clay im sorry
are you leaving
yes
can you give me a lift
to the nearest town
anywhere with a train station
sure trentos half an hours drive
get in
j1 been another blue day
without you girl
j1 been another sad summer song
j1 i been thinking about you girl
all night long
what are you doing
you hear that noise when you accelerate
no
your fan belt is loose
my what
and when you brake
your foot goes all the way down
which means theres air in the system
anything else
no
apart from
the rear brakes are worn out
the front right tyres a bit soft
which explains
why youre weaving so much
hmm how can you tell
my ass
sorry
god gave me an okay mind
but a really good ass
which can feel everything in a car
you dont know what
youre talking about this car is fine
i just had a service a week ago
not a good one
yes a very good one very expensive
this car is as good as new relax
not in a hurry are you
no as long as im back
in maranello monday morning
ja
marlene
niki
mi scusi tu sei niki lauda
yes
actually we do yeah
okay
its my honour niki please
thank you
my car is your car
on one condition though
its a piece of shit its dog shit
but if you drive it
you make my life niki eh
niki lauda
niki lauda niki lauda
will someone please tell me
whats going on
who are you should i know you
what you dont know
hes niki lauda formula 1 driver
and he just signed with ferrari
him
yes
impossible
why
well you know formula 1 drivers
they have long hair are sexy
their shirts are open to here
thank you
yes
anyway look at the way hes driving
like an old man
theres no need to drive fast
it just increases
the percentage of risk
were not in a hurry
im not being paid
right now
with zero incentive or reward
why would i drive fast
because im asking you to
ja
this is an incredible battle
between niki lauda in the red ferrari
and james hunt in the white hesketh
the challenge of niki lauda
lauda attacking hunt
lauda gets through on the inside
goes wide at the exit
hunt is past again
once more
lauda tries to sneak up the inside
theyre absolutely side by side
wheel to wheel
so evenly matched fantastic battle
between these two great drivers
hunt is now ahead once more
but laudas coming back again now
lauda once more sneaks up the inside
and again he runs wide
again the hesketh
suzy were ready come on
just just one second
can we go yeah
okay yeah
were in the closing laps
of this race here at watkins glen
they come down the hill
and hunts got a problem
hunt pulls across to the left
lauda goes ahead on his own
a sad end to a wonderful battle
hunt pushing off the marshal
the chequered ﬂag
is waiting for lauda and for ferrari
the title going to niki lauda
who wins the race
who wins the world championship
congratulations
thank you
marlene
with a car like that the rest of us
never really stood a chance did we
maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me
come on niki youre in a ferrari
im in a hesketh
equal terms
the way it was in formula 3
id beat you and you know it
never
you might win one race maybe two
because youre aggressive
but in the long run over the course
of a season no chance
right whys that
because to be a champion
it takes more than just being quick
its the whole picture
oh
youre just a charger and a party guy
thats why everybody likes you
try saying that
and tell me youre not jealous
why would i be jealous think about it
all that affection all those smiles
is a sign of disrespect
oh
they dont fear you
whereas compare that to me
yes compared to you whom no one likes
right
not even his own teammates
right because im a serious guy
i go to bed early
i look after myself look after my car
yes youre very wellbehaved
go to work kick ass
and then after the race
i go home instead of going to bars
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes
arseholes
you should go home more often too
i heard you got married
yes i did
so where is she this mysterious wife
in new york working
oh
you know
ive never seen you with her once
no
well maybe thats because
youre always at home
on your own looking after yourself
being a good little boy
take a drink on me james
thank you niki i might just have two
right bubbles
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year just say it
your word is my command
there are no lengths
to which i will not go i mean it
what the hells going on
where is everybody whats the matter
do you know what the date is today
yes its november the 14th why
do you have any idea
of the significance of that date
i dont know
time to start killing pheasants
actually its the deadline
for securing sponsorship
for the forthcoming formula 1 season
yes
which elapsed at midnight last night
and we didnt attract any
well so
we arent looking for sponsorship
like you said condoms and cigarettes
vulgar right
right
except we are or were
ive made something of a miscalculation
the economics formula 1
realities thereof
it turns out
not like the lower divisions at all
what are you saying
im saying its over superstar
the banks have stepped in
started laying everyone off
probably have to sell this place
oh christ
i need a drive pete
i need you to find me a drive
i mean what about lotus
you dont wanna know
actually i do
okay uh
they felt your reputation preceded you
and what does that mean
its my other line
look ill get back to you
peter hunt
fuck
dont worry something will turn up
doubt that will help in the meantime
why dont we go away at the weekend
skiing before i go back to new york
talk to me james
dont make a stranger of me
you know suzy
only a stranger would invite me skiing
when they know
i havent got a fucking drive
i cant watch this
what were you hoping for anyway
a welladjusted knight
in shining armour
no danger of that
let me give you some advice
im all ears
dont go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles
looking for normality
i never expected normality
god knows i walked into this
with my eyes open
i just hoped id married someone
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside
at least theres something
behind the facade
oh james
fuck off to new york dear
there must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere
that needs your vapid mush to flog it
hello
hi james
its peter somethings up at mclaren
what have you heard
nothing why
i heard emersons off
hes dumped them in it
jesus get me in there pete
say anything just get me in that room
ill come straight to the point
our esteemed lead driver
fittifuckingpaldi
has ditched us for another team
at the last minute
coperfuckingsucar
and we need a replacement
asafuckingp
fortunately a few hands
have already gone up good people
jacky ickx
im quicker than jacky
but hes consistent dependable
a grownup
right and will he go for that gap
when no one else will
will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters
the sponsors like him
what do you want
a driver or a brush salesman
we wanna be successful
yes so do i
but that means beating niki lauda
not being a show pony for sponsors
i heard about this thing with niki
everyone has
you really think you can beat him
id beat him in a mclaren
its the only car out there
as quick as the ferrari
which is why im here begging
look ill do whatever you ask
ill put on a tie
ill smile for sponsors
say the right things
i can beat this guy trust me
just give me the drive
yeah
yeah he can be a loose cannon
and yeah he will drive you all mad
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff
there is no better driver in the world
hes the real thing teddy
hes what we all came into this for
mmm
nine days out of ten
youll be pulling your hair out
but on that tenth day
james will be unbeatable
and that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car
you will never win the championship
with jacky ickx
you just might with james
welcome to sao paulo brazil
and the interlagos circuit
for the first race
in the 1976 formula 1 season
where the main news is that james hunt
has qualified fastest
beating niki laudas ferrari
to pole position
by just two hundredths of a second
new car
i noticed
pole position
i noticed that too
level playing field now
my ratty little friend
yeah lets see where we are
after lap one
lets see where we are
in five races time
hunt has the pit lane pole position
which should give him the best chance
of outdragging laudas ferrari
if ever there was a doubt about
whether lauda had
a serious challenger to this season
hunt and his mclaren
have certainly given us the answer
here in south africa
james hunt is determined to make amends
after that disastrous retirement
in brazil
but its lauda who takes the ﬂag
here at kyalami
james hunt comes home second
to confirm his championship
challenge at last
and score his first points
of the season
that wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck
next time ill have you
well see in spain
james hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season
here in spain after a brilliant drive
it was only a matter of time
luca dont you think its time
to tell them
its too wide
disqualified
what
youre disqualified
how can we be disqualified
15 centimetres
its the same car
giustissimo
you fucking
mclaren m23
has proved very controversial here
just make it narrower i dont care how
new rear suspension
new wishbones
i wanna make sure
this thing is legal no doubts
well then wed better move the
oil coolers back to the old position
with the oil coolers back the
wing brackets need to be changed too
fuck
what the fuck
dyou think were doing
and with hunt disqualified
from his spain win
his championship year is not going well
and now its all gone wrong
here at monaco
his engine is smoking
smoke pouring
from the engine of that mclaren
and james hunt is out
can you tell us what happened
sure its magic
weve taken a great car
a great piece of engineering
and overnight turned it into
a big huge stinking turd
shit
what the hell have you done
the cars evil
its fucking undriveable
james look if theres a problem
with the car well find it
the car is a piece of shit
you should be appealing this
we are appealing it
we will sort it out
theyre killing us out there
go and get your dick wet
youre a wanker
fuck you
youre a fucking wanker
i will arsehole
but this was a good race for you
no niki
its good for everyone
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car
james youre 50 points
behind lauda in the championship
youve had another retirement today
whats going wrong
oh its dirty politics
and dirty tricks
thats whats going wrong
so as we approach
the halfway point
in this years formula 1 season
ferrari and niki lauda
seem clearly on top
and james hunt and mclaren
are struggling
so five races in
hows it going so far
its fine just got a little problem
with an austrian rat
and his team of italian cheats
who have destroyed my car
what are you talking about
im talking about the race in spain
that i won
yeah in a car which is not legal
fiveeighths of an inch too wide
you know that doesnt have
the slightest effect on speed
but you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities
now weve had to rebuild the car
and its become a monster
at least its a legal monster
youve had to resort to cheating
youre driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat its pathetic
rules are rules
yes and rats are rats
thank you thank you
do you really think it upsets me james
calling me a rat
because i look like one
i dont mind it
rats are ugly sure
and nobody likes them
but theyre very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct
wonderful
marlene komm
no wonder she left him
anyone seen suzy
shes supposed to be here today
we er didnt wanna tell you
before the race
tell me what
jesus
is that from him
yeah
so when did all this start
that weekend i went skiing
why have you come here james
ive come to get you back
you dont want me back
you never wanted to be married
in the first place
yes i did
oh come on james
you did it because
you hoped it might change you
settle you down help with the racing
no i didnt
and who knows
if it had been just the drinking
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods
it might even have worked
but when its all of them
yes i know im terrible
no youre not terrible
youre just who you are
at this point in your life
god help anyone who wants more
and richard burton
will he able to give you more
you know he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself
whats important is how it feels to me
and it feels like he adores me
james
new york times
are you and suzy getting back together
james how do you feel
its all very amicable
my wife has found herself
a new backer
i mean lover which makes her happy
and mr burton has found
a way of feeling young again
which makes him happy
lets hope his pockets are deep
theyll need to be
and ive found a way to be single
and have an exwife
without it costing me a penny
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career
i have a flight to catch
we havent seen
this sort of intensity
from james hunt all season long
reports have been coming out
of the mclaren camp all week
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever
never mind the bloody wets
were still quick
hunt has really closed the gap on lauda
as they head into druids
niki lauda is under real pressure
from james hunt
as they go up the hill
into druids corner
and hunt is in front of lauda
so james hunt gets the plaudits
of the crowd the first briton to win
a british grand prix at brands hatch
since jim clark in 1964
james at the moment
youve got a terrific edge
over the rest of the field
how have you achieved this advantage
big balls
would you
following an inquiry
into the disqualification
of driver james hunt
from the spanish grand prix
it has been decided
to overturn this disqualification
yes
and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points
james james
james a few weeks ago
you were out of the running
for the season completely
and now youre right back in it
whats changed
well its a combination of factors
not all of which im prepared
to discuss here
but justice being done
re the disqualification in spain helps
and having my car
back at its best again
james james
welcome to the legendary nurburgring
this is a 142mile track
complete with 185 corners and bends
welcome to the nurburgring
the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar
in formula 1 it is known
as the graveyard
the weather conditions
are far from ideal
and latest reports indicate
there is no relief in sight
gentlemen well gentlemen
please be quiet
thank you niki lauda
thank you
i called this meeting because
as all you drivers know
the nurburgring is the most stupid
barbaric outdated
and dangerous track in the world
youve all seen the rain
that has been falling today
now those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk
and today with the rain
its anything but perfect
so i called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race
cancel the race
there would be no change
to the situation
as far as points is concerned
the race would simply be cancelled
this is bullshit
if the race is cancelled
none of us get our race fees
thats true you leave without your fee
but you might leave with your life
it also means that you would
effectively win the championship
so i can see why
this suits you just fine
why there would be
no points for me either
no but there would be one race less
where i or anyone else here
could catch you
james is right this is just tactics
maybe hes just frightened
which asshole said this
yes of course im frightened
and so are you
i accept every time i get in my car
there is 20 per cent chance i could die
and i can live with it
but not one per cent more
and today with the rain
the risk is more
i suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain
i have the track record here
i am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes
so actually its to my advantage
to race here today
because im quicker than all of you
come on
fine then lets race
come on niki lets race
gentlemen please
why are we here niki come on
well all those in favour
of cancelling the race
all those in favour of racing
gentlemen the race is on
ridiculous
what a waste of time
you know niki every now and then
it helps if people like you
in places
the track is still dangerously wet
but following a drivers meeting
a decision has finally been taken
the race is going ahead
niki
one minute to go
jochens going on slicks
you wanna change
is niki gonna change
no
then we stay on wets too
niki okay
im good
all right fire her up
this seasons fight for
the formula 1 world championship
has so far been the story of two men
thus far its been going
pretty much the way of niki lauda
but james hunt
has qualified fastest here
he is on pole position
for the german grand prix
with niki lauda alongside
in the bloodred ferrari
its a long race
if the track starts to dry out
the wetweather tyres
will no longer be as quick
niki lauda
and james hunt side by side
on the front row of the grid
go away absolutely as one
lauda very aggressive on hunt there
forcing the mclaren onto the grass
lauda has the lead at the moment
lauda leads into the first corner
hunt is in second place
mass storming past hunt
he made the right choice
to go with the dryweather tyres
mass passing lauda now
jochen mass in the number 12 mclaren
takes the lead
jochen mass the clear leader
with everybody else making the decision
to change tyres
after just one lap of this race
hes coming in come on lets go
see i told you to go on slicks
you should have taken my advice
fuck off wheres niki
behind you
he made the same mistake
come on
come on whats going on
the tyrechanging frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack
with jochen mass in the lead now
youre clear go
quick
lauda urging his mechanics to hurry
quicker quicker quicker
its a disaster come on
whats going on you assholes
this race has gone wrong for him so far
his championship rival james hunt
is a long way up the road
lauda passing car after car
hes just going past
mario andrettis lotus there
niki
get me out help me
we have an accident
on the course red flags are out
several cars are involved looks like
it might be one of the ferraris
come this way
come on come on
keep trying
come this way
okay
the ﬂood which swept
down big thompson canyon in colorado
was the worst since records began
in formula 1 today
victory celebrations were muted
after a horrific accident involving
world champion niki lauda
due to safety concerns before the race
the austrian had said
he would not take part
but in the end he did
he was making up for lost time
when he went off the track
puncturing the ferraris fuel tank
brett lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck
but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue lauda
who was taken to mannheim hospital
with severe burns
the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of formula 1
niki lauda was trapped
for almost a minute
in a searing inferno
of 800plus degrees
do we have any change this morning
no
frau lauda frau lauda
morning chaps
hey heres the man
looking good
whats going on
jesus its niki
what about him
hes here
what
hes racing
niki
its that bad huh
no
in hospital i asked them straight
no bullshit
how bad my appearance would be
they said with time it would be fine
but it wont
i can tell seeing your reaction
i will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people
you know niki i tried to write you
a letter at the time to apologise
the drivers meeting in germany
before the race
i swayed the room
yes you did
that race should never have gone ahead
no it shouldnt
so in many ways i feel responsible
for what happened and
you were
but trust me
watching you win those races
while i was fighting for my life
you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car
how are you feeling niki
fine
niki can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures youve had
and the expectations for your recovery
sure
i had a skin graft operation
where they put half my right thigh
in my face
now it doesnt look too good
but one unexpected advantage is
its impossible to perspire
through a skin graft
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again which is good for a driver
when they heard about your condition
ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver carlos reutemann
yeah before even reaching the hospital
is reutemann driving today too
yes and keen to make an impression
so lets see where mr reutemann
finishes and where i finish today
james hunt and mclaren have
caught up a lot while you were away
yes
so is there a question now
or are you just trying to piss me off
you still think you can win
yes of course
i have the better car
and possibly im the better driver
but hes a clever guy
and hes used his time well
while i was lying halfdead in hospital
to win some points
and what did your wife say
when she saw your face
she said sweetie
you dont need a face to drive
you just need a right foot
im being serious
do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now
and im being serious too
fuck you press conference over
that was hairy
well you got noticed clive
ill tell you that
i thought it went well
to be honest
they dont like it
when its not going their way
clive
thats the game
see you
see you later
james are you all right
good yeah
listen i think
ive got something for you
on that last question about niki
you heard about that
i did
james
please james
now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look
prick
so niki lauda just 42 days after
his nearfatal accident at nurburgring
will race here today at monza
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain
niki lauda
photographers
please clear the grid
niki its time
okay
please clear the grid
one minute to go
the returning niki lauda
seems overwhelmed
hes being overtaken by car after car
laudas off line
he runs wide onto the grass
he wrestles it back onto the track
but that was a bad moment for niki
niki laudas the reigning
world champion
but maybe in his current state
hes a danger out there
to himself and to the rest of the field
and stuck has collided
with mario andrettis lotus
nikis boxed in hes got nowhere to go
niki lauda is actually
making a move hes on brambillas tail
he pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake
laudas starting to find the form
that early in this race
we believed hed lost
laudas now lapping faster than
reutemann and closing the gap ahead
lauda closing on carlos reutemann
the man called in to be his replacement
in the ferrari team
and theres james hunts mclaren
smoking stationary
by the side of the road
this is bad news for hunts
championship hopes
its ronnie peterson
who comes home the winner here at monza
but all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth
niki lauda
what a race what a man
what a season
with a fourthplace finish
and three priceless points
it means that niki lauda
is a major step closer
to retaining the world championship
so the long gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season
comes down to this final race in japan
in the shadow of mount fuji
niki lauda goes into
this deciding race at fuji
just three points ahead of james hunt
hunt knowing he must beat the austrian
fair and square to take the title
james do you think
you can cope with the pressure
well ive never really understood
what that means i love my job
i love competing i love racing
maybe you should ask niki
hes the world champion
hes got everything to lose
mr lauda
are you feeling pressure
do i look like im feeling pressure
i am world champion and on the verge
to become world champion again
hunt now has the opportunity to win
but its not so easy
to become a champion
you have to really believe it
to make it possible
james is there anything
youd like to add
if niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games
then fine im flattered
but the fact is momentum is with me
ive never felt better
and i fully expect the next
press conference we will have
will be with me as world champion
how will you cope
with the weather bad conditions
intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at fuji today
along with strong winds
and occasional fog
rolling in from the mountain
and so with todays
japanese grand prix to come
laudas lead a mere three points
what a way to finish the season
hunt or lauda
well the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage
theyve got to cancel the race
its lethal out there
the race is going ahead
television rights have been sold
all around the world
the showdown between you and niki
is all anyone wants to see
with heavy rain
continuing to fall here at fuji
a decision has finally been made
the 1976 japanese grand prix
will go ahead
ah drivers
to your cars please
five minutes to go
all right
all right
hold still
what the hell are you doing
to let the condensation out
itll also let the water in
not if youre leading
trust me
this race is all about the start
need a hand here
yeah hold it teddy
okay start the bastard
good luck kid
good luck james
thirty seconds to go
electric tension here at fuji
80000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade
and theres mario andretti
in pole position
james hunt alongside him
on row 2 of the grid
there is niki lauda
and on row 3 of the grid
jody scheckter from south africa
in the sixwheel tyrrell
behind him
the rest of the 25car field
theres the flag and finally
the japanese grand prix is underway
in these conditions
it must be almost impossible to drive
a 450horsepower car
and its andretti who has the lead
but hunt is attacking
hunts going round
the outside of andretti
niki lauda following him through
hunt leads into the first righthander
hunt comes through
to complete his first lap
leading the field
at least he has clear vision
in front of him
niki lauda behind him
eating his spray
lauda is slowing
niki lauda is bringing
the ferrari number one into the pit
some sort of problem we cant
imagine what so early in the race
whats wrong with the car
whats wrong with the car
niki whats wrong with the car
nothing cars perfect
what are you doing
im stopping
his mechanics
are asking what the problem is
but wait
niki laudas getting out of the car
this is sensational
the reigning world champion
niki lauda is out of this race
its too dangerous
niki you want me to say there was
a problem with the car for the media
no
tell them the truth
now what is happening
theyre talking to the team manager
lauda explaining something
with lauda out james hunt
knows he has to finish this race
in third place or higher
to be world champion
but the jobs not done yet
for james hunt
in these dreadful conditions
he still has to go the distance
fifteen laps to go here at fuji
james hunt or niki lauda
this extraordinary season
is not over yet
in this treacherous final round
can james hunt hang on
and the scoreboard tells a story
lap 58 hunt in the lead
oh god his tyres theyre blistering
brambilla very close behind now
closing on him all the time now
and hes trying to drive
inside james hunt
hunt cuts across the orange march nose
hunts not having that at all
and hes spinning
he missed hunt there but almost
took james hunt out of the race
and out of the world championship
now we find mario andretti
closing on james hunt
mario andrettis going past hunt
hunt is slowing james hunt
seems to have a problem
despite these wet conditions
these wetweather tyres
do wear extremely fast
hunts tyres theyve gone
hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop
that back markers going past hunt
look at that left front tyre
right front tyre sorry
no tread on it at all
and the other one is flat
lets go lets go
okay when did you break
your gear lever
nine or ten laps ago
alastair we need to lift it
come on
at the front
lets go
regazzonis ferrari
and jacques lafitte in the ligier
have gone ahead
come on hurry
you did it
youre going to be world champion
not yet
a few laps ago james hunt
was looking like champion elect
now it looks as though
its all gone wrong for him
james
come on
listen
what
just go easy out there
what are you saying
im saying look after yourself
we want you back in one piece
youre too far back theres
too many drivers in front of you
theres always next year
so thats it its over
clear
james
clear
fuck it
james hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position
there are four laps left to go
surely no way back for the brit now
concentrate superstar
just brings it back under control
sliding the mclaren
on the very edge there
hunts m23
twitching this way and that
under braking
and he almost loses it right there
hunt on the tail
of jacques lafitte in the blue ligier
oh dont do it james
hes inches away
from the pit wall
hes inches away from the ligier
james hunt has made up another place
but its not enough
and this race is running out
and watson has spun
watson has spun
hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker
and the stationary penske
hes catching regazzoni
but in these conditions
its one thing to catch up
its quite another to overtake
hes alongside clay regazzoni
this could be the world championship
hes got him
hunt crosses the line
now he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be world champion
and in the confusion here were being
told that he may have finished fifth
he finished fifth
our lap charts
show hunt in third place
well if the scoreboards right
it means hes just missed out
on the championship
crushing defeat for hunt
after such a heroic drive
i can see the race stewards conferring
examining the official lap charts
were just going to have to wait
for their verdict here
lets get you out of there buddy
im sorry teddy im sorry
i thought i could make up the ground
sorry what are you talking about
you did it
did what
jesus you crazy bastard
you came third you got the points
youre champion of the world
james hunt
is now officially confirmed
as finishing third here in japan
and that means
he is champion of the world
our new world champion
james hunt by just one single point
did we really win
world bloody champion
tell us james
what are you going to do now
i shall be getting drunk
its wonderful
an absolute dream
and our special guest
formula 1 champion james hunt
wait come on
theres no better motor oil
than havoline
yes me too
where are we going
anywhere i want to go
and i dont have to hijack it either
as long as i pay for it
im starving
lets get some food
where are we going
you lot go ahead
i wont be a minute
good to see you
i heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these
do you fly
no
i dont think theyd insure me
you should try
its good for discipline
you have to stay within the rules
stick to regulations
suppress the ego
it helps with the racing
and there i was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical
about the romance of flight
no thats all bullshit
so what brings you here
a friends wedding
at least i think it was a wedding
might have been a birthday or something
its all a bit of a blur
how about you have you been at fiorano
preseason testing
youre relentless
thank you
im not sure that was meant
as a compliment
when do you start testing next week
no what are you nuts
i didnt just win
the biggest thing of my life
so i could get right back to work
why you have to
to prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because
because of what
because of your accident
niki is that other people
or is that you
i won okay on the allimportant day
when it came down to it
we raced on equal terms
equally good cars
and i put my life on the line
and i saw it through
and you call that winning
yes
the risks were totally unacceptable
you were prepared to die
to me thats losing
yes i was i admit it
i was prepared to die
to beat you that day
and thats the effect you have on me
youd pushed me that far
and it felt great
i mean hell
isnt that what were in this for
to stare death in the face
and to cheat it
come on theres nobility in that
its its like being knights
you english youre such assholes
you know my position
twenty per cent risk
no no no niki dont bring the
percentages into this dont be a pro
the minute you do that
you kill whats good about this
you kill the sport
james
james
come on
ive got to go
careful in this thing
james
you know in hospital the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum
pumping the shit out of my lungs
it was hell
and while doing it
i was watching television
you winning all my points
your points
that bastard hunt i would say
i hate that guy
and then one day
the doctor came and said
mr lauda
may i offer a piece of advice
stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life
it can be a blessing too
a wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends
and you know what he was right
look at us we were both
a pair of kids when we met
hotheaded jerks in formula 3
disowned by our families
headed nowhere
and now were both
champions of the world
it was not bad huh
no its not bad
so dont let me down now
i need you busting my balls
get back to work
i will niki i will
but i intend to enjoy myself first
some of life needs to be for pleasure
whats the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes
if you dont have any fun
how is that winning
james
were gonna leave without you
james
ill see you on race day champ
you will champ
you look good niki
the only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement
of course
he didnt listen to me
for james
one world title was enough
he had proved
what he needed to prove to himself
and anyone who doubted him
and two years later he retired
when i saw him next in london
seven years later
me as champion again
him as broadcaster
he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre
still living each day like his last
when i heard hed died
aged 45 of a heart attack
i wasnt surprised
