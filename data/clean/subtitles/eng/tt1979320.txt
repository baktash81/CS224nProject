so uncertain 
the drivers prepare for   
   the track is still dangerously wet 
but following a drivers  meeting 
  a decision has finally been taken 
  three minutes to go 
everybody off the grid now 
twenty five drivers
start every season in formula 1 
and each year two of us die 
what kind of person
does a job like this 
not normal men  for sure 
rebels  lunatics  dreamers 
people who are desperate to make a mark
and are prepared to die trying 
my name is niki lauda 
and racing people
know me for two things 
the first is my rivalry with him 
photographers 
please clear the grid 
what about hunt  has he changed 
no  he s going on wets 
i don t know
why it became such a big thing 
we were just drivers
busting each other s balls 
to me this is perfectly normal 
but other people saw it differently 
that whatever it was between us
went deeper 
the other thing i m remembered for
is what happened on 1st august  1976 
when i was chasing him
like an asshole 
trauma trolley  please 
hello  i think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that i was coming 
hunt  james hunt 
what s the matter  no one ever seen
a spot of blood before 
  are you all right 
  absolutely fine 
we all thought
you d been in an accident 
i have 
if you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident 
what did you disagree about 
it s none of your business 
sorry 
his wife 
that s going to need a couple
of stitches  it s a nasty cut 
it was a nasty blow 
done with a bloody crowbar 
  why  what did you do 
  nothing 
only what she asked me to do 
which was   
i d be happy to show you  if you like 
oh  sorry 
i have a theory
why women like racing drivers 
it s not because
they respect what we do 
driving round and round in circles 
mostly they think that s pathetic 
and they re probably right 
it s our closeness to death 
you see  the closer you are to death 
the more alive you feel 
the more alive you are 
and they can see that in you 
they feel that in you 
my name is james hunt 
my father is a stockbroker 
my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant 
and i   
well  i do this 
it s a wonderful way to live 
it s the only way to drive 
as if each day is your last 
i ve never been to a grand prix before 
oh  you still haven t 
  this is formula 3 
  what s that 
it s a lower division 
where idiots like me mess about
in the hope of being talent spotted
to race in formula 1 
  you look disappointed 
  no 
ah  you only slept with me
because you thought i was famous 
that s not true 
don t worry  i will be one day 
morning  everyone 
  this is nursie 
  gemma 
nursie  this is bubbles horsley 
team manager 
how do you do 
  bubbles 
  yeah 
  doc postlethwaite  our designer 
  how do you do 
and alexander  lord hesketh 
the team s owner 
how do you do 
fine  thanks 
well done  superstar 
  that s the car 
  yep  that s her 
lotus 59 
1 000cc cosworth mae engine 
she s no beauty 
but goes like the clappers 
nothing to be worried about 
does it before every race 
good sign  actually  means he s stoked 
ah formula 3 cars
to the assembly area now  please 
   drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now 
all right  superstar 
never better  patron 
  have a gargle with this 
  thank you 
quick toke of this 
at crystal palace today 
james hunt s on pole 
with austrian newcomer
niki lauda alongside him
and dave walker completing row 1 
row 2 is mike beuttler and dave morgan 
  with tony trimmer and gerry birrell 
  who s that 
he s new 
  some german 
  austrian 
he s been here since 5 00 am 
walking the track 
you might actually
have to concentrate today  james 
you ll need these 
   okay  start her up 
ah  what music 
they could never have imagined it 
those pioneers
who invented the automobile 
that it would possess us like this 
in our imaginations  in our dreams 
nursie  men love women 
but even more than that 
men love cars 
  come on  james 
  james  come on  james 
go  james 
hunt s still in the lead 
but niki lauda is right on his tail 
hunt and lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own 
they re leaving the pack far behind 
herr red devil s on his tail 
lauda takes a look down the inside   
   and he s sold him a dummy 
lauda is through  he s in the lead 
hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake 
hunt s in lauda s slipstream 
lauda s not leaving any gap 
the lotus goes for the inside 
it s an aggressive move from hunt 
oh  there s contact 
the leaders have spun out 
lauda s facing the wrong way 
the back marker s gone through 
you can see why hunt s fellow drivers
  call him  hunt the shunt  
asshole 
  go on  james 
  the kraut s out of it 
lauda is clearly furious 
there s every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits 
it s gonna be victory for hunt 
it s gonna be an ignominious defeat
for niki lauda 
so james hunt scores his
third major formula 3 win of the season
here at crystal palace 
after a desperate battle
with niki lauda 
lauda was unable to restart
after hunt s aggressive move
caused them both to spin out
in the last lap of the race 
hard luck 
better luck next time 
hey  asshole 
that was my line  i had that corner 
do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way 
i think that corner had you 
that move was total suicide 
what if i hadn t braked 
  we d have crashed 
  but we didn t  did we 
thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts 
fuck you  what s your name 
james simon wallis hunt 
remember it  my little jerry friend 
jawohl  remember ze name 
and it s very simple  hunt 
it rhymes with   
   cunt 
a word that happens
to describe you perfectly 
who was that 
i ve no idea 
he looks like a rat  doesn t he 
in my home town  vienna 
my family is famous
for one thing   business 
my grandfather was a businessman 
my father  too 
so when they heard i wanted
to race cars for a living 
they had a few things to say 
gut 
so if my family
wasn t going to help me 
i decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself 
i found a formula 1 team
with an okay car
and an owner who had run out of money
and was willing to accept my terms 
and so 
ladies and gentlemen 
i m delighted to say
that the winner of the guild of motoring
writers award driver of the year   
is james hunt 
superb news 
  well done  james 
  superstar 
fantastic 
  well done  congratulations 
  thank you so much 
yes 
erm   
you know  my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor   
   or a stockbroker or something 
they gave me the first class education 
but  well  that all went terribly wrong
and i ended up with you lot 
thank you  i need it more than you do 
i mean  i have a hot head 
an inability to tolerate discipline 
  yes 
  very true 
i fall out with people left and right 
the only creatures i ve ever really
loved or have treated honourably
are budgerigars 
so in any normal area of life i d be   
or i am  a total liability 
the only thing i ve got going for me
is i m quick in a car 
so  thank you for this
and for acknowledging that 
i m going to give it to my father
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece
and imagine it s a first class degree
in medicine 
well done  superstar 
another season like that
and i ll move you up to the big time 
come on  you don t think i m ready now 
you are  i m not 
i ve got to find you a car first 
well  go on  then  chop chop 
don t wait too long  you don t want him
to do what lauda just did 
  why  what did he do 
  got himself a drive with brm 
well  how the hell did he do that 
he s a nobody 
he s never won a bloody thing 
apparently  took out a loan
and bought his way in
with two million austrian schillings 
jesus 
niki lauda 
here for pre season testing  brm 
sign the release form 
i ll let them know you re here 
  mr stanley 
  good morning 
  good morning 
  good morning  clay 
let me introduce you
to our number one driver 
clay regazzoni 
  how are you 
  good 
  pleasure 
  and these are your mechanics 
they re reporting exclusively to you 
as per contract 
pleasure  do you wanna see the car 
sure 
hello 
there she is  p160 
  same as regazzoni s 
  identical in every detail 
how much does she weigh 
  600 kilos 
  but that s crazy 
  why so heavy 
  it s a v12 engine 
that lump weighs 190k on its own 
okay 
what horsepower are you getting  490 
  no  no  450 
  well  it s not enough 
it needs to be 500 
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter 
we already tried 
  tried what 
  everything 
we replaced the entire exhaust system 
  barely made a difference 
  are you using magnesium parts 
now the engine block 
any mounting or fixing plates 
strip it out also 
when you ve done that 
we have to look at the aerodynamics 
front and rear wing 
okay  thank you  good night 
what was regazzoni s time 
1253 
okay  now put him in my car 
and he ll go round two seconds faster 
  well  that s impossible 
   no chance 
we ve been working on it all night 
put regazzoni in the car 
see what happens 
i don t understand 
why am i supposed to do this 
i don t know  clay 
he just wants you to take it for a spin 
gloves  please 
 fanculo 
  i would say we push it a bit   
  all right 
what did you do to the car 
that s information i will share with you
under certain conditions only 
go on 
a guaranteed place in the team 
and a paid contract on equal terms
with regazzoni for two years 
are you crazy 
clay s a senior figure in formula 1 
you re just a rookie 
well  the only reason we took you on
is because you re paying us 
well  as of now  if you want me to stay 
we rip up the contract 
  i don t pay you a cent 
  that s outrageous 
was he quicker in my car 
he was  wasn t he 
did he go two seconds faster 
2 3 
so  have a think 
work out your priorities
and get back to me 
hey  niki 
i know what you re going to say 
that it s none of my business 
what 
if it s the track manager
you re taking on your date tonight   
it s none of your business 
okay  but if you want my advice 
i d let this one go 
i m not questioning your taste 
she is a great girl  but   
agnes s last boyfriend
was a british formula 2 driver
who has a reputation for two things 
for being a little crazy on the track 
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed 
he s a good driver 
but an immortal fuck  apparently 
i don t know about you  but
that s not an act i d like to follow 
but if that doesn t bother you   
what s his name  the driver 
hunt  james hunt 
you see  you share information
and i share information 
that s what teammates are for 
where the hell are we going 
i promise
it ll be worth it 
just keep them closed 
wait for it 
wait for it 
there  what do you say 
she s formula 1 
yes  she is  superstar 
your brother and i got together
with the bean counters 
and since the economics of f1
are not so significantly different
to the economics of formula 2 
well  we thought if we were
going to be losing money 
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in formula 1 
you fat  little  inbred beauty 
come here 
actually  credit where it s due 
we got the idea from niki 
  who 
   lauda 
bought his way in  rather than
mess about in the lower divisions 
i thought   bloody hell  he s right  
no sponsorship  superstar 
i hope you approve 
no vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms 
just plain white with the flags  ooh 
and racing overalls which read 
 sex  breakfast of champions  
so  when do we start 
  soon as you re ready 
  ready 
i ve been waiting for this
my whole life 
  hi  welcome to watkins glen 
  hello 
when the season started 
people wondered
whether lord hesketh and his team
of upper class enthusiasts
were bringing glamour
to the racing community  or just comedy 
certainly  it was the first time
anyone had seen
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits 
but they have made quite an impact 
sixth in france  fourth in britain
and third in holland 
ah drivers on the track 
caution flags are out 
a severe crash at the esses 
red flag 
there is a car off the track 
and reports are reaching me
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying 
er  the identity of the driver we don t
currently have at the moment 
but  as you can tell
from all the activity
going on behind me towards the track 
it is clearly a grave incident indeed 
we will  of course 
have more information for you
as and when we get it 
but it is the sight and sound
of formula 1 nobody likes to see 
  get your hands off me 
  hey  come on 
drivers of top stature
we ve lost just in the past four seasons
have included piers courage 
jochen rindt 
jo siffert  roger williamson
and today  at watkins glen 
formula 1 has claimed another driver 
the tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race 
their places on the grid
will be left empty 
  terrible 
  they should cancel the race 
why 
he made a mistake 
went into the corner too fast 
it s his fault 
  is that right 
  it s obvious 
look at the tyre marks 
so says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive 
how s that working out for you 
by the way 
fine  how is it at the back 
not planning on being there for long 
ten minutes to the warm up lap 
ten minutes 
arsehole 
heading into
the grand hotel hairpin  second gear 
turn in hard 
looking for late apex 
gentle with the bar 
heading into portier  second gear 
clip the apex 
light brake  stay in second 
looking for a good exit 
heading through the tunnel 
gradual right 
up through third  fourth  fifth   
ls alexander round 
er  yes  he was 
he went back to the house
to take a call 
he ll be back shortly 
he only wanted to show me
his pride and joy 
rhymes with  boy   if you ask me 
and  toy  
god  it s so flimsy
for something that costs so much 
there s no comfort 
no protection  nothing 
no  it s just a little coffin  really 
surrounded by high octane fuel in here 
being driven round 170 miles per hour 
to all intents and purposes 
this thing s a bomb on wheels 
you re james  aren t you 
yes 
you fit the description 
is that right 
suzy  friend of alex s 
yeah  yeah  i know exactly 
what was the description 
mostly positive 
in terms of appearance 
negative only in terms of character 
i ve been told to avoid you 
by whom 
alexander  he says you re a bad boy 
alexander doesn t know
what he s talking about 
i was  i m not any more 
the new me is very professional 
early to bed  early to rise 
  all very dull 
  hmm 
but according to the team 
 the best way to
keep beating the goose stepper  
is that what you were doing
when i came in 
yes  visualisation techniques 
memorising the circuit 
in this case monaco  which is up next 
personally  i ve always been a great
believer in getting there on the day 
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else 
but they don t want me
doing that any more 
they want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk 
and what about your soul  your heart 
well  they ve got ideas about that  too 
they want me to stop messing around 
settle down 
get married
with the next nice girl i meet 
they think it would be good for me 
hmm  what do you think 
it sounds fucking awful 
but since they re right
about most things 
  they re probably right about that  too 
  hmm 
you don t fancy getting married  do you 
suzy 
bravo 
hey  hey  hey 
  what s going on with him 
  nothing  nothing 
didn t want to ruin your day 
it s    it s the kraut 
what about him 
he s just been signed by ferrari 
you re kidding me 
jesus  how did that happen 
did he buy his way in there  too 
well  the old man took regazzoni back
and he insisted on it  apparently 
he says that niki s a genius
setting up the cars 
it s terrible  drives like a pig 
  oh  you can t say that 
  why not 
  it s a ferrari 
  it s a shitbox 
it understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster 
it s amazing  all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this 
uh 
 ferrari family  
 our good friend clay regazzoni  
you are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win 
the minute you don t  ciao  ciao 
i totally understand  it s business 
i would do the same 
but it isn t
just business  is it  what we do 
it s passion  love 
which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it 
not me 
if i had more talent and could earn
better money with something else 
i would 
how do you know you will
make money here  you haven t yet 
not yet  but i will 
if you can  i can 
you know  are you ever not an asshole 
  why am i an asshole 
  well   
you know  by now
i m both quicker than you
and better at setting up the car 
you can t deal with it 
so you re the asshole 
screw you 
i brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy 
i thought if i introduced you
to some nice people 
that could rub off on you 
forget it  make your own friends 
come on  clay  i m sorry 
are you leaving 
yes 
can you give me a lift
to the nearest town 
anywhere with a train station 
sure  trento s half an hour s drive 
get in 
j1 been another blue day
without you  girl
j1 been another sad summer song
j1 i been thinking about you  girl 
all night long
what are you doing 
you hear that noise when you accelerate 
  no 
  your fan belt is loose 
my what 
and when you brake 
your foot goes all the way down 
which means there s air in the system 
  anything else 
  no 
apart from
the rear brakes are worn out 
the front right tyre s a bit soft 
which explains
why you re weaving so much 
hmm  how can you tell 
  my ass 
  sorry 
god gave me an okay mind 
but a really good ass 
which can feel everything in a car 
you don t know what
you re talking about  this car is fine 
  i just had a service a week ago 
  not a good one 
yes  a very good one  very expensive 
this car is as good as new  relax 
not in a hurry  are you 
no  as long as i m back
in maranello monday morning 
ja 
  marlene 
  niki 
mi scusi    tu sei niki lauda 
yes 
  actually  we do  yeah 
  okay 
it s my honour  niki  please 
  thank you 
  my car is your car 
on one condition  though 
it s a piece of shit  it s dog shit 
but if you drive it 
you make my life  niki  eh 
  niki lauda 
  niki lauda  niki lauda 
will someone please tell me
what s going on 
who are you  should i know you 
what  you don t know 
he s niki lauda  formula 1 driver 
and he just signed with ferrari 
  him 
  yes 
  impossible 
  why 
well  you know  formula 1 drivers 
they have long hair  are sexy 
their shirts are open to here 
  thank you 
  yes 
anyway  look at the way he s driving 
like an old man 
there s no need to drive fast 
it just increases
the percentage of risk 
we re not in a hurry 
i m not being paid 
right now 
with zero incentive or reward 
why would i drive fast 
because i m asking you to 
ja 
this is an incredible battle
between niki lauda in the red ferrari
and james hunt in the white hesketh 
   the challenge of niki lauda   
lauda attacking hunt 
lauda gets through on the inside 
goes wide at the exit 
hunt is past again 
once more
lauda tries to sneak up the inside 
they re absolutely side by side 
wheel to wheel 
so evenly matched  fantastic battle
between these two great drivers 
hunt is now ahead once more 
but lauda s coming back again now 
lauda once more sneaks up the inside 
and again he runs wide 
again the hesketh   
  suzy  we re ready  come on 
  just    just one second 
  can we go  yeah 
  okay  yeah 
we re in the closing laps
of this race here at watkins glen 
they come down the hill 
and hunt s got a problem 
hunt pulls across to the left 
lauda goes ahead on his own 
a sad end to a wonderful battle 
hunt pushing off the marshal 
the chequered ﬂag
is waiting for lauda and for ferrari 
the title going to niki lauda 
who wins the race 
who wins the world championship 
  congratulations 
  thank you 
marlene 
with a car like that  the rest of us
never really stood a chance  did we 
maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me 
come on  niki  you re in a ferrari 
i m in a hesketh 
equal terms 
the way it was in formula 3 
  i d beat you and you know it 
  never 
you might win one race  maybe two 
because you re aggressive 
but in the long run  over the course
of a season  no chance 
right  why s that 
because to be a champion 
it takes more than just being quick 
  it s the whole picture 
  oh 
you re just a charger and a party guy 
that s why everybody likes you 
try saying that
and tell me you re not jealous 
why would i be jealous  think about it 
all that affection  all those smiles
  is a sign of disrespect 
  oh 
they don t fear you 
whereas compare that to me 
yes  compared to you  whom no one likes 
  right 
  not even his own teammates 
right  because i m a serious guy 
i go to bed early 
i look after myself  look after my car 
  yes  you re very well behaved 
  go to work  kick ass 
and then  after the race 
i go home instead of going to bars
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes 
arseholes 
you should go home more often  too 
i heard you got married 
yes  i did 
so where is she  this mysterious wife 
  in new york  working 
  oh 
you know 
i ve never seen you with her once 
no 
well  maybe that s because
you re always at home 
on your own  looking after yourself 
being a good little boy 
take a drink on me  james 
thank you  niki  i might just have two 
right  bubbles 
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year  just say it 
your word is my command 
there are no lengths
to which i will not go  i mean it 
what the hell s going on 
where is everybody  what s the matter 
do you know what the date is today 
yes  it s november  the 14th  why 
do you have any idea
of the significance of that date 
i don t know 
time to start killing pheasants 
actually  it s the deadline
for securing sponsorship
for the forthcoming formula 1 season 
yes 
which elapsed at midnight last night 
and we didn t attract any 
well  so 
we aren t looking for sponsorship 
like you said  condoms and cigarettes 
vulgar  right 
right 
except we are  or were 
i ve made something of a miscalculation 
the economics  formula 1 
realities thereof 
it turns out 
not like the lower divisions at all 
what are you saying 
i m saying it s over  superstar 
the banks have stepped in 
started laying everyone off 
probably have to sell this place 
oh  christ 
i need a drive  pete 
i need you to find me a drive 
i mean  what about lotus 
you don t wanna know 
  actually  i do 
  okay  uh   
they felt your reputation preceded you 
and what does that mean 
it s my other line 
look  i ll get back to you 
peter hunt 
fuck 
don t worry  something will turn up 
doubt that will help in the meantime 
why don t we go away at the weekend 
skiing  before i go back to new york 
talk to me  james 
don t make a stranger of me 
you know  suzy 
only a stranger would invite me skiing
when they know
i haven t got a fucking drive 
i can t watch this 
what were you hoping for anyway 
a well adjusted knight
in shining armour 
no danger of that 
  let me give you some advice 
  i m all ears 
don t go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles
  looking for normality 
  i never expected normality 
god knows i walked into this
with my eyes open 
i just hoped i d married someone
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside 
at least there s something
behind the facade 
  oh  james 
  fuck off to new york  dear 
there must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere
that needs your vapid mush to flog it 
  hello 
  hi  james 
it s peter  something s up at mclaren 
  what have you heard 
  nothing  why 
i heard emerson s off 
he s dumped them in it 
jesus  get me in there  pete 
say anything  just get me in that room 
i ll come straight to the point 
  our esteemed lead driver   
  fitti fucking paldi 
   has ditched us for another team
at the last minute 
  coper fucking sucar 
  and we need a replacement 
asa fucking p 
fortunately  a few hands
have already gone up  good people 
  jacky ickx 
  i m quicker than jacky 
  but he s consistent  dependable 
  a grown up 
right  and will he go for that gap
when no one else will 
will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters 
the sponsors like him 
what do you want 
a driver or a brush salesman 
  we wanna be successful 
  yes  so do i 
but that means beating niki lauda 
not being a show pony for sponsors 
i heard about this thing with niki 
everyone has 
  you really think you can beat him 
  i d beat him in a mclaren 
it s the only car out there
as quick as the ferrari 
which is why i m here  begging 
look  i ll do whatever you ask 
i ll put on a tie 
i ll smile for sponsors 
say the right things 
i can beat this guy  trust me 
just give me the drive 
yeah 
yeah  he can be a loose cannon 
and  yeah  he will drive you all mad 
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff 
there is no better driver in the world 
he s the real thing  teddy 
  he s what we all came into this for 
  mmm 
nine days out of ten
you ll be pulling your hair out 
but on that tenth day 
james will be unbeatable 
and that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car 
you will never win the championship
with jacky ickx 
you just might with james 
welcome to sao paulo  brazil 
and the interlagos circuit
for the first race
in the 1976 formula 1 season 
where the main news is that james hunt
has qualified fastest 
beating niki lauda s ferrari
to pole position
by just two hundredths of a second 
new car 
  i noticed 
  pole position 
i noticed that  too 
level playing field now 
my ratty little friend 
yeah  let s see where we are
after lap one 
let s see where we are
in five races  time 
hunt has the pit lane pole position 
which should give him the best chance
of outdragging lauda s ferrari 
if ever there was a doubt about
whether lauda had
a serious challenger to this season 
hunt and his mclaren
have certainly given us the answer 
here in south africa 
james hunt is determined to make amends
after that disastrous retirement
in brazil 
but it s lauda who takes the ﬂag
here at kyalami 
james hunt comes home second
to confirm his championship
challenge at last
and score his first points
of the season 
that wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck 
next time i ll have you 
we ll see in spain 
james hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season
here in spain  after a brilliant drive 
it was only a matter of time 
luca  don t you think it s time
to tell them 
  it s too wide 
  disqualified 
  what 
  you re disqualified 
how can we be disqualified 
  1 5 centimetres 
  it s the same car 
giustissimo 
you fucking   
   mclaren m23
has proved very controversial here 
just make it narrower  i don t care how 
new rear suspension 
new wishbones 
i wanna make sure
this thing is legal  no doubts 
well  then we d better move the
oil coolers back to the old position 
with the oil coolers back  the
wing brackets need to be changed  too 
fuck 
what the fuck
d you think we re doing 
and with hunt disqualified
from his spain win 
his championship year is not going well 
and now it s all gone wrong
here at monaco 
his engine is smoking 
smoke pouring
from the engine of that mclaren 
and james hunt is out 
  can you tell us what happened 
  sure  it s magic 
we ve taken a great car 
a great piece of engineering 
and overnight turned it into
a big  huge  stinking turd 
shit 
what the hell have you done 
the car s evil 
it s fucking undriveable 
james  look  if there s a problem
with the car we ll find it   
the car is a piece of shit 
you should be appealing this 
  we are appealing it 
  we will sort it out 
  they re killing us out there 
  go and get your dick wet 
  you re a wanker 
  fuck you 
  you re a fucking wanker 
  i will  arsehole 
but this was a good race for you 
no  niki 
it s good for everyone
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car 
james  you re 50 points
behind lauda in the championship 
you ve had another retirement today 
what s going wrong 
oh  it s dirty politics
and dirty tricks 
that s what s going wrong 
so  as we approach
the halfway point
in this year s formula 1 season 
ferrari and niki lauda
seem clearly on top 
and james hunt and mclaren
are struggling 
so  five races in 
how s it going so far 
it s fine  just got a little problem
with an austrian rat
and his team of italian cheats
  who have destroyed my car 
  what are you talking about 
i m talking about the race in spain
that i won 
  yeah  in a car which is not legal 
  five eighths of an inch too wide 
you know that doesn t have
the slightest effect on speed 
but you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities 
now we ve had to rebuild the car 
and it s become a monster 
  at least it s a legal monster 
  you ve had to resort to cheating 
you re driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat  it s pathetic 
  rules are rules 
  yes  and rats are rats 
thank you  thank you 
do you really think it upsets me  james 
calling me a rat
because i look like one 
i don t mind it 
rats are ugly  sure 
and nobody likes them 
but they re very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct 
  wonderful 
  marlene  komm 
no wonder she left him 
anyone seen suzy 
she s supposed to be here today 
we  er    didn t wanna tell you
before the race 
tell me what 
jesus 
is that from him 
yeah 
so when did all this start 
that weekend i went skiing 
why have you come here  james 
i ve come to get you back 
you don t want me back 
you never wanted to be married
in the first place 
  yes  i did 
  oh  come on  james 
you did it because
you hoped it might change you 
settle you down  help with the racing 
no  i didn t 
and who knows 
if it had been just the drinking
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods 
it might even have worked 
  but when it s all of them   
  yes  i know  i m terrible 
no  you re not terrible 
you re just who you are
at this point in your life 
god help anyone who wants more 
and richard burton 
will he able to give you more 
you know  he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself 
what s important is how it feels to me 
and it feels like he adores me 
  james 
  new york times 
are you and suzy getting back together 
  james  how do you feel   
  it s all very amicable 
my wife has found herself
a new backer   
i mean  lover  which makes her happy 
and mr burton has found
a way of feeling young again 
which makes him happy 
let s hope his pockets are deep 
they ll need to be 
and i ve found a way to be single
and have an ex wife
without it costing me a penny 
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career 
i have a flight to catch 
we haven t seen
this sort of intensity
from james hunt all season long 
reports have been coming out
of the mclaren camp all week
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever 
never mind the bloody wets 
we re still quick 
hunt has really closed the gap on lauda
as they head into druids 
niki lauda is under real pressure
from james hunt
as they go up the hill
into druids corner 
and hunt is in front of lauda 
so james hunt gets the plaudits
of the crowd  the first briton to win
a british grand prix at brands hatch
since jim clark in 1964 
james  at the moment
you ve got a terrific edge
over the rest of the field 
how have you achieved this advantage 
big balls 
would you   
following an inquiry
into the disqualification
of driver james hunt
from the spanish grand prix 
it has been decided
  to overturn this disqualification   
  yes 
   and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points 
james  james 
james  a few weeks ago
you were out of the running
for the season completely 
and now you re right back in it 
  what s changed 
  well  it s a combination of factors  
not all of which i m prepared
to discuss here  
but justice being done
re the disqualification in spain helps 
and having my car
back at its best again 
james  james 
welcome to the legendary nurburgring 
this is a 14 2 mile track 
complete with 185 corners and bends 
welcome to the nurburgring 
the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar 
in formula 1 it is known
as the graveyard 
the weather conditions
are far from ideal 
and latest reports indicate
there is no relief in sight 
gentlemen  well  gentlemen 
please be quiet 
thank you  niki lauda 
thank you 
i called this meeting because 
as all you drivers know 
the nurburgring is the most stupid 
barbaric  outdated
and dangerous track in the world 
you ve all seen the rain
that has been falling today 
now  those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk 
and today  with the rain 
it s anything but perfect 
so i called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race 
cancel the race 
there would be no change
to the situation
as far as points is concerned 
  the race would simply be cancelled 
  this is bullshit 
if the race is cancelled 
none of us get our race fees 
that s true  you leave without your fee 
but you might leave with your life 
it also means that you would
effectively win the championship 
so  i can see why
this suits you just fine 
why  there would be
no points for me either 
no  but there would be one race less
where i  or anyone else here 
could catch you 
james is right  this is just tactics 
maybe he s just frightened 
which asshole said this 
yes  of course i m frightened 
and so are you 
i accept  every time i get in my car 
there is 20 per cent chance i could die 
and i can live with it 
but not one per cent more 
and today  with the rain 
the risk is more 
i suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain 
i have the track record here 
i am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes 
so  actually  it s to my advantage
to race here today 
because i m quicker than all of you 
  come on 
  fine  then let s race 
  come on  niki  let s race 
  gentlemen  please 
why are we here  niki  come on 
well  all those in favour
of cancelling the race 
all those in favour of racing 
gentlemen  the race is on 
  ridiculous 
   what a waste of time 
you know  niki  every now and then
it helps if people like you 
in places
the track is still dangerously wet 
but following a drivers  meeting 
a decision has finally been taken 
the race is going ahead 
niki 
one minute to go 
jochen s going on slicks 
you wanna change 
  is niki gonna change 
  no 
then we stay on wets  too 
  niki  okay 
  i m good 
all right  fire her up 
this season s fight for
the formula 1 world championship
has so far been the story of two men 
thus far  it s been going
pretty much the way of niki lauda 
but james hunt
has qualified fastest here 
he is on pole position
for the german grand prix 
with niki lauda alongside
in the blood red ferrari 
it s a long race 
if the track starts to dry out 
the wet weather tyres
will no longer be as quick 
niki lauda
and james hunt  side by side
on the front row of the grid 
go away absolutely as one 
lauda very aggressive on hunt there 
forcing the mclaren onto the grass 
lauda has the lead at the moment 
lauda leads into the first corner 
hunt is in second place 
mass storming past hunt 
he made the right choice
to go with the dry weather tyres 
mass passing lauda now 
jochen mass  in the number 12 mclaren 
takes the lead 
jochen mass the clear leader 
with everybody else making the decision
to change tyres
after just one lap of this race 
he s coming in  come on  let s go 
see  i told you to go on slicks 
you should have taken my advice 
fuck off  where s niki 
behind you 
he made the same mistake 
come on 
come on  what s going on 
the tyre changing frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack 
  with jochen mass in the lead now 
  you re clear  go 
quick 
lauda urging his mechanics to hurry 
quicker  quicker  quicker 
it s a disaster  come on 
what s going on  you assholes 
this race has gone wrong for him so far 
his championship rival  james hunt 
is a long way up the road 
lauda passing car after car 
he s just going past
mario andretti s lotus there 
niki 
get me out  help me 
we have an accident
on the course  red flags are out 
several cars are involved  looks like
it might be one of the ferraris 
  come this way 
  come on  come on 
keep trying 
  come this way 
  okay 
the ﬂood  which swept
down big thompson canyon in colorado 
was the worst since records began 
in formula 1 today 
victory celebrations were muted
after a horrific accident involving
world champion niki lauda 
due to safety concerns before the race 
the austrian had said
he would not take part 
but in the end he did 
he was making up for lost time
when he went off the track 
puncturing the ferrari s fuel tank 
brett lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck 
but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue lauda 
who was taken to mannheim hospital
with severe burns 
the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of formula 1 
niki lauda was trapped
for almost a minute
in a searing inferno
of 800 plus degrees 
  do we have any change this morning 
  no   
frau lauda  frau lauda 
  morning  chaps 
  hey  here s the man 
looking good 
  what s going on 
  jesus  it s niki 
  what about him 
  he s here 
  what 
  he s racing 
niki 
it s that bad  huh 
no 
in hospital i asked them straight 
no bullshit 
how bad my appearance would be 
they said with time it would be fine 
but it won t 
i can tell  seeing your reaction 
i will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people 
you know  niki  i tried to write you
a letter at the time  to apologise 
the drivers  meeting in germany 
before the race 
  i swayed the room 
  yes  you did 
that race should never have gone ahead 
no  it shouldn t 
so  in many ways  i feel responsible
for what happened  and   
you were 
but  trust me   
watching you win those races
while i was fighting for my life   
   you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car 
  how are you feeling  niki 
  fine 
niki  can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you ve had
and the expectations for your recovery 
sure 
i had a skin graft operation 
where they put half my right thigh
in my face 
now  it doesn t look too good 
but one unexpected advantage is
it s impossible to perspire
through a skin graft 
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again  which is good for a driver 
when they heard about your condition 
ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver  carlos reutemann 
yeah  before even reaching the hospital 
is reutemann driving today  too 
yes  and keen to make an impression 
so  let s see where mr reutemann
finishes and where i finish today 
james hunt and mclaren have
caught up a lot while you were away 
yes 
so is there a question now 
or are you just trying to piss me off 
you still think you can win 
yes  of course 
i have the better car 
and possibly i m the better driver 
but he s a clever guy 
and he s used his time well
while i was lying half dead in hospital
to win some points 
and what did your wife say
when she saw your face 
she said   sweetie 
you don t need a face to drive 
 you just need a right foot  
i m being serious 
do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now 
and i m being serious  too 
fuck you  press conference over 
  that was hairy 
  well  you got noticed  clive 
i ll tell you that 
i thought it went well 
to be honest 
they don t like it
when it s not going their way 
  clive 
  that s the game 
  see you 
  see you later 
  james  are you all right 
  good  yeah 
listen  i think
i ve got something for you
on that last question  about niki 
  you heard about that 
  i did 
james 
please  james   
now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look 
prick 
so niki lauda  just 42 days after
his near fatal accident at nurburgring 
will race here today at monza
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain 
   niki lauda 
photographers 
please clear the grid 
niki  it s time 
okay 
please clear the grid 
one minute to go 
the returning niki lauda
seems overwhelmed 
he s being overtaken by car after car 
lauda s off line 
he runs wide onto the grass 
he wrestles it back onto the track 
but that was a bad moment for niki 
niki lauda s the reigning
world champion 
but maybe in his current state
he s a danger out there 
to himself and to the rest of the field 
and stuck has collided
with mario andretti s lotus 
niki s boxed in  he s got nowhere to go 
niki lauda is actually
making a move  he s on brambilla s tail 
he pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake 
lauda s starting to find the form
that  early in this race 
we believed he d lost 
lauda s now lapping faster than
reutemann and closing the gap ahead 
lauda closing on carlos reutemann 
the man called in to be his replacement
in the ferrari team 
and there s james hunt s mclaren 
smoking stationary
by the side of the road 
this is bad news for hunt s
championship hopes 
it s ronnie peterson
who comes home the winner here at monza 
but all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth 
  niki lauda 
what a race  what a man 
what a season 
with a fourth place finish
and three priceless points 
it means that niki lauda
is a major step closer
to retaining the world championship 
so  the long  gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season
comes down to this final race in japan
in the shadow of mount fuji 
niki lauda goes into
this deciding race at fuji
just three points ahead of james hunt 
hunt knowing he must beat the austrian
fair and square to take the title 
james  do you think
you can cope with the pressure 
well  i ve never really understood
what that means  i love my job 
i love competing  i love racing 
maybe you should ask niki 
he s the world champion 
he s got everything to lose 
mr lauda 
are you feeling pressure 
do i look like i m feeling pressure 
i am world champion  and on the verge
to become world champion again 
hunt now has the opportunity to win 
but it s not so easy
to become a champion 
you have to really believe it
to make it possible 
james  is there anything
you d like to add 
if niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games   
   then fine  i m flattered 
but the fact is  momentum is with me 
i ve never felt better 
and i fully expect the next
press conference we will have
will be with me as world champion 
how will you cope
with the weather  bad conditions 
intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at fuji today 
along with strong winds
and occasional fog
rolling in from the mountain 
and so  with today s
japanese grand prix to come 
lauda s lead a mere three points 
what a way to finish the season 
hunt or lauda 
well  the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage   
they ve got to cancel the race 
it s lethal out there 
the race is going ahead 
television rights have been sold
all around the world 
the showdown between you and niki
is all anyone wants to see 
with heavy rain
continuing to fall here at fuji 
a decision has finally been made 
the 1976 japanese grand prix
will go ahead 
ah drivers
to your cars  please 
five minutes to go 
  all right 
  all right 
  hold still 
  what the hell are you doing 
to let the condensation out 
  it ll also let the water in 
  not if you re leading 
trust me 
this race is all about the start 
  need a hand here 
  yeah  hold it  teddy 
okay  start the bastard 
good luck  kid 
good luck  james 
thirty seconds to go 
electric tension here at fuji 
80 000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade 
and there s mario andretti
in pole position 
james hunt alongside him 
on row 2 of the grid 
there is niki lauda 
and on row 3 of the grid 
jody scheckter from south africa
in the six wheel tyrrell 
behind him 
the rest of the 25 car field 
there s the flag  and finally
the japanese grand prix is underway 
in these conditions 
it must be almost impossible to drive
a 450 horsepower car 
and it s andretti who has the lead 
but hunt is attacking 
hunt s going round
the outside of andretti 
niki lauda following him through 
hunt leads into the first right hander 
hunt comes through
to complete his first lap 
leading the field 
at least he has clear vision
in front of him 
niki lauda  behind him 
eating his spray 
lauda is slowing 
niki lauda is bringing
the ferrari number one into the pit 
some sort of problem  we can t
imagine what  so early in the race 
what s wrong with the car 
what s wrong with the car 
niki  what s wrong with the car 
nothing  car s perfect 
  what are you doing 
  i m stopping 
his mechanics
are asking what the problem is 
but wait 
niki lauda s getting out of the car 
this is sensational 
the reigning world champion 
niki lauda  is out of this race 
it s too dangerous 
niki  you want me to say there was
a problem with the car  for the media 
no 
tell them the truth 
now  what is happening 
they re talking to the team manager 
lauda explaining something 
with lauda out  james hunt
knows he has to finish this race
in third place or higher
to be world champion 
but the job s not done yet
for james hunt 
in these dreadful conditions 
he still has to go the distance 
fifteen laps to go here at fuji 
james hunt or niki lauda 
this extraordinary season
is not over yet 
in this treacherous final round 
can james hunt hang on 
and the scoreboard tells a story 
lap 58  hunt in the lead 
oh  god  his tyres  they re blistering 
brambilla very close behind now 
closing on him all the time now 
and he s trying to drive
inside james hunt 
hunt cuts across the orange march nose 
hunt s not having that at all 
and he s spinning 
he missed hunt there  but almost
took james hunt out of the race
and out of the world championship 
now we find mario andretti
closing on james hunt 
mario andretti s going past hunt 
hunt is slowing  james hunt
seems to have a problem 
despite these wet conditions 
these wet weather tyres
do wear extremely fast 
hunt s tyres  they ve gone 
hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop 
that back marker s going past hunt 
look at that left front tyre   
right front tyre  sorry 
no tread on it at all 
and the other one is flat 
let s go  let s go 
okay  when did you break
your gear lever 
nine or ten laps ago 
  alastair  we need to lift it 
  come on 
  at the front 
   let s go 
regazzoni s ferrari
and jacques lafitte in the ligier
have gone ahead 
come on  hurry 
you did it 
you re going to be world champion 
not yet 
a few laps ago  james hunt
was looking like champion elect 
now it looks as though
it s all gone wrong for him 
  james 
  come on 
  listen 
  what 
just go easy out there 
  what are you saying 
  i m saying look after yourself 
we want you back in one piece 
you re too far back  there s
too many drivers in front of you 
  there s always next year 
  so that s it  it s over 
clear 
james 
  clear 
  fuck it 
james hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position 
there are four laps left to go 
surely no way back for the brit now 
concentrate  superstar 
just brings it back under control 
sliding the mclaren
on the very edge there 
hunt s m23
twitching this way and that
under braking 
and he almost loses it right there 
hunt on the tail
of jacques lafitte in the blue ligier 
oh  don t do it  james 
he s inches away
from the pit wall 
he s inches away from the ligier 
james hunt has made up another place 
but it s not enough 
and this race is running out 
and watson has spun 
watson has spun 
hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker
and the stationary penske 
he s catching regazzoni
but  in these conditions 
it s one thing to catch up 
it s quite another to overtake 
he s alongside clay regazzoni 
this could be the world championship 
he s got him 
hunt crosses the line 
now  he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be world champion 
and in the confusion here  we re being
told that he may have finished fifth 
he finished fifth 
our lap charts
show hunt in third place 
well  if the scoreboard s right 
it means he s just missed out
on the championship 
crushing defeat for hunt
after such a heroic drive 
i can see the race stewards conferring 
examining the official lap charts 
we re just going to have to wait
for their verdict here 
let s get you out of there  buddy 
i m sorry  teddy  i m sorry 
i thought i could make up the ground 
sorry  what are you talking about 
you did it 
  did what 
  jesus  you crazy bastard 
you came third  you got the points 
you re champion of the world 
james hunt
is now officially confirmed
as finishing third here in japan 
and that means
he is champion of the world 
our new world champion 
james hunt  by just one single point 
did we really win 
world bloody champion 
tell us  james 
what are you going to do now 
i shall be getting drunk 
it s wonderful 
an absolute dream   
and our special guest 
formula 1 champion james hunt 
wait  come on 
there s no better motor oil
than havoline 
yes  me  too 
where are we going 
anywhere i want to go 
and i don t have to hijack it  either 
as long as i pay for it 
i m starving 
let s get some food 
  where are we going 
  you lot go ahead 
i won t be a minute 
good to see you 
i heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these 
  do you fly 
  no 
i don t think they d insure me 
you should try 
it s good for discipline 
you have to stay within the rules 
stick to regulations 
suppress the ego 
it helps with the racing 
and there i was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical
about the romance of flight 
no  that s all bullshit 
so  what brings you here 
a friend s wedding 
at least i think it was a wedding 
might have been a birthday or something 
it s all a bit of a blur 
how about you  have you been at fiorano 
pre season testing 
  you re relentless 
  thank you 
i m not sure that was meant
as a compliment 
when do you start testing  next week 
no  what  are you nuts 
i didn t just win
the biggest thing of my life
so i could get right back to work 
why  you have to 
to prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because   
because of what 
because of your accident 
niki  is that other people 
or is that you 
i won  okay  on the all important day 
when it came down to it 
we raced on equal terms 
equally good cars 
and i put my life on the line 
and i saw it through 
  and you call that winning 
  yes 
the risks were totally unacceptable 
you were prepared to die 
to me  that s losing 
yes  i was  i admit it 
i was prepared to die
to beat you that day 
and that s the effect you have on me 
you d pushed me that far 
and it felt great 
i mean  hell 
isn t that what we re in this for 
to stare death in the face
and to cheat it 
come on  there s nobility in that 
it s    it s like being knights 
you english  you re such assholes 
you know my position 
twenty per cent risk 
no  no  no  niki  don t bring the
percentages into this  don t be a pro 
the minute you do that 
you kill what s good about this 
you kill the sport 
james 
  james 
  come on 
i ve got to go 
careful in this thing 
james 
you know  in hospital  the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum 
pumping the shit out of my lungs 
it was hell 
and while doing it 
i was watching television 
  you winning all my points 
  your points 
 that bastard hunt   i would say 
 i hate that guy  
and then one day
the doctor came and said 
 mr lauda 
may i offer a piece of advice 
 stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life 
 it can be a blessing  too 
 a wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends  
and you know what  he was right 
look at us  we were both
a pair of kids when we met 
hot headed jerks in formula 3 
disowned by our families 
headed nowhere 
and now we re both
champions of the world 
it was not bad  huh 
no  it s not bad 
so  don t let me down now 
i need you busting my balls 
  get back to work 
  i will  niki  i will 
but i intend to enjoy myself first 
some of life needs to be for pleasure 
what s the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes
if you don t have any fun 
how is that winning 
  james 
  we re gonna leave without you 
james 
i ll see you on race day  champ 
you will    champ 
you look good  niki 
the only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement 
of course 
he didn t listen to me 
for james 
one world title was enough 
he had proved
what he needed to prove  to himself
and anyone who doubted him 
and two years later he retired 
when i saw him next in london
seven years later 
me as champion again 
him as broadcaster 
he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre 
still living each day like his last 
when i heard he d died 
aged 45  of a heart attack 
i wasn t surprised
