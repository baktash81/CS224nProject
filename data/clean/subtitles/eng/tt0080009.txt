we met on this selfsame road
the other day   
   and i said   good night   and
you replied   good night  sir john  
i may have 
  did so again today 
  so i did 
why call me  sir john  when i be
plain jack durbeyfield  the haggler 
just a whim of mine 
i m parson tringham by the way 
i made a discovery about you
while tracing some family trees   
   for our new county history 
i m an antiquarian  you know 
you  durbeyfield 
are directly descended   
   from the knightly house
of the d urbervilles 
  did you really not know that 
  never heard it before  sir 
raise your head a little so that i can
see your face from the side 
yes  that s the d urberville
nose and chin 
  a trifle coarser than of old  but still 
  daze my eyes 
according to the records  your line
goes back to sir pagan d urberville   
   who came from normandy
with william the conqueror 
i ve been slaving away
and living rough all these years 
well  i thought you might already
know something about it 
it is true  i got an old silver spoon
at home and a graven seal   
   but i never paid them much heed 
where do we d urbervilles live today 
you don t live anywhere 
you lie buried in your family vault
at kingsbere sub greenhill   
   laid out in lead coffins with your
effigies under marble canopies 
  and where be our family mansions 
  you haven t any 
no land neither 
none at all 
you had an abundance of land
in the old days 
what can i do about it  sir 
well  as to that    
  can i do nothing 
  nothing whatever   
   save possibly chasten yourself
by thinking 
 how are the mighty fallen  
good night   
   sir john 
won t you take a quart of beer
with me  sir 
there s a grand brew to be had
at the pure drop 
though not so good as at rolliver s 
sir john d urberville 
that s who i am 
what is this 
  it is our club dance  sir 
  club dance 
  but where are your partners 
  they ve not finished work yet 
they ll be here by and by 
  will you join us till then  sir 
  with pleasure   
   but one partner won t go far
among so many 
one s better than none 
it is sad work a footing it
with no one to give you a squeeze 
don t be so forward 
  what are you doing 
  i ve a mind to enjoy myself  come on 
you re full of nonsense 
suppose someone sees us 
all right  go on  don t wait for me 
i ll catch you up in five minutes 
sir  hey  hey  hey  sir 
hey  sir 
life has found me
a great gentleman 
  noblest in the county 
  lord  oh  lord 
if it isn t your father
riding home in his cart 
there bain t be a man in the whole
of wessex with finer skeletons than i 
father s tired  that s all 
he sent for the cart
because our own horse died 
you know that very well 
rows and rows
of knightly ancestors  i got 
bain t be a man in the whole
of wessex with finer skeletons than i 
i m glad you ve come 
where are you off to 
i thought i d change and help you 
you bide here  i want to tell you
what s happened 
we ve been found to be the greatest
gentlefolk in the county   
   reaching back long before
oliver crumble s time   
   back to the days
of the pagan turks 
with monuments and vaults   
   and crests and coats of arms 
and the lord knows what all 
is that why father made such
a mommet of himself in that cart 
our true name is d urberville 
that s why he came home in style 
not because he d been drinking 
where is he now 
it was a parson told him
the pedigree of the matter 
  but where is he now 
  well  to tell you the truth   
   he was that upset  he s gone off
to rolliver s to get up his strength 
much strength he ll find
at the bottom of a pint pot 
very well  i ll go and get him 
we ll be back afore you know it 
now  look  be a good girl
and put the little ones to bed for me 
there it is 
that 
that spoon may be small 
but my family was great 
  jack  i ve got a project 
  we owned carriages  estates   
     and mansions without number 
  listen to me 
is there any money in it 
it is well to be kin to a coach 
even if you don t ride in one 
i ve been thinking since
you brought me the news 
  i ve got a project 
  which reminds me  woman 
you better find that dang seal
of ours  or i ll do you a mischief 
listen  there s a great lady
by the name of d urberville   
   living out by trantridge 
well  she s nothing compared
with us 
younger branch of the family 
no doubt 
i ll wager they don t go back
to king norman s day 
that s as may be  but she s rich 
lot of good her money will do us 
it could do  we must send
our tess to claim kin 
  claim kin 
  why shouldn t two branches   
   of the same family
be on visiting terms 
it would certainly put her
in the way of a grand marriage 
then she ought to go there tomorrow 
let s drink to that  mrs  rolliver 
there you are  my poppet 
we was just on our way 
but you re asking me to go begging 
begging  what are you saying 
it is all in the family 
if they was in need  i should
take them in without a word 
we all have to take the ups
with the downs  tess 
now  you must go and see her   
   and ask her for some help
in our trouble 
if the lady received me at all  it
would be enough if she were friendly 
you must not expect her to help us 
come  come  my dear 
with your pretty face 
you could coax her into anything 
i d rather try to get work 
durbeyfield  you decide 
if you say she must go  she ll go 
well  girl  do you want to go visiting
this grand kinswoman of ours 
  i d much sooner not  father 
  there  she doesn t want to 
i don t like my children making
themselves beholden with strange kin 
i m the head of the noblest branch
of the family   
   and i got my pride to think of 
all this bragging about your ancestors 
it isn t them as will buy us
a new horse 
it s all new 
well  my beauty   
   what can i do for you 
  i came to see mrs  d urberville 
  i m afraid that s impossible 
she s an invalid 
what was your business with her 
i m her son 
it wasn t business  it was    
i can hardly say what 
  not business  sir  no 
  pleasure  then 
no  sir 
it is so very foolish  i    
  i fear i can t tell you 
  never mind 
i like foolish things 
try again  dear 
i came  sir  to tell you that   
   we are of the same family as you 
poor relations 
  yes 
  stokes 
no  d urbervilles 
yes  yes  i meant d urbervilles 
tell me   
   do you like strawberries 
  yes  when they re in season 
  here  they already are 
our name has become durbeyfield   
   but we have several proofs
that we re d urbervilles 
that s who the antiquarians
hold we are  so mother said   
   we should make ourselves
beknown to you   
   as we ve lost our horse   
   and we are the oldest branch
of the family 
i see 
so you ve come to pay me
a courtesy call  really   
   as one relation to another 
  i suppose i have 
  yes  well  there s no harm in that 
i would rather take it
from my own hand 
don t be so coy  my pretty cousin 
there 
come  this one too 
it s the perfect place 
believe me 
you ll look a regular posy 
  what s the matter 
  a thorn 
cousin  beauty has its price 
i m not very hungry  truly  i m not 
nonsense 
you must eat something
before you go 
it s no mean ride
from here to your village 
i shall see what i can do for you 
but listen  tess  no more
of this d urberville nonsense 
plain durbeyfield  understand 
it s quite a different name 
i wish for no better  sir 
 in reference to your daughter
and further to her visit   
   we write to inform you
of our willingness   
   to consider engaging her services   
   in the managing of a poultry farm
of modern character 
if  after a suitable period 
your daughter   
   proves satisfactory 
we should guarantee her   
   comfortable accommodation
and a good wage 
your earliest reply would be
greatly appreciated  
so you charmed them after all 
did you 
let me see that letter 
  who wrote it 
  who 
mrs  d urberville  of course 
look at the signature 
me  manage a poultry farm 
  i truly don t think i should go 
  poultry 
it is just her way of getting you there
without raising your hopes too much 
she s going to own you as kin 
hey  the seal 
this is it 
it s the same as ours 
look at it  lad 
a ramping  great  big lion
with a castle on top 
there s no denying it  girl 
mrs  d urberville recognized
her own flesh and blood 
but she never even saw me 
well  you couldn t expect her to throw
her arms round your neck   
   her being an invalid 
but her son made you welcome 
he called you  cousin   didn t he 
i d rather bide here with you 
goodbye  father 
  you re off  then 
  yes  goodbye  father 
goodbye  girl 
you re a comely sight 
this young cousin of yours   
   tell him that  being so come down
in the world   
   i ll sell him the title 
yes  i ll sell it  but a fair price 
not less than
a thousand pounds  mind 
that s right  tell him
i ll take a thousand pounds 
well  now i come to think on it   
   he can have it for a hundred 
i won t stand on trifles 
fifty 
twenty pounds  tell him 
and not a penny less 
  family honor is family honor 
  come  it s time to go 
i want to walk a little ways
with tess 
so do i  now she s leaving
to marry our gentleman cousin 
i ll hear no more of that 
mother  how could you have put
such nonsense into their heads 
she s going to work for a rich relation 
my dears   
   and help us earn enough money
to get a new horse 
oh  mother  i wish our tess
hadn t gone to be a lady 
don t hold my arm 
grab me round the waist 
ungrateful little minx  why abandon
me as soon as you feel safe 
the danger came of your foolishness 
i say  what a temper 
when people are on top of a hill 
they have to get down somehow 
but not at a gallop  surely 
fancy being asked that
by a brave little beauty like you 
i always go downhill at a gallop 
you can t beat it
for stirring the blood 
but perhaps you needn t
do so again 
perhaps not 
it all depends 
one little kiss on those ruby lips
or even on that satin cheek   
   and i drive at a snail s pace 
word of honor 
but i don t want to be kissed  sir 
stop  stop  i beg you 
very well  do as you wish 
i don t mind 
but i thought you d protect me 
being a kinsman 
kinsman be hanged 
you re mighty sensitive
for a village lass 
  oh  my hat 
  whoa  boy 
you look even prettier without it 
  come along  now  up you get 
  no  sir 
  you won t ride with me 
  no  i shall walk 
it s four miles to trantridge  at least 
i wouldn t care if it were 20 
you watch out for dollop  the bailiff 
he s a devil 
not mr  alec  spends half
his time on horseback   
   and the rest of it chasing
the likes of us 
his mother s a queer old soul 
but no real trouble 
it is a mercy for us she s blind 
  mrs  d urberville s blind 
  stone blind 
their real name is stoke 
how s that 
it were mr  alec s father
had the notion 
he bought the name
of an old extinguished family   
   to make himself important 
whatever are you doing 
missus is waiting for her birds 
quick  it slipped my mind entirely 
now  you catch hold
of phena there   
   and that one 
that one there and the white one 
so you are the new young woman 
well  how are my birds 
this is strut 
he doesn t seem so lively today 
does he 
he s alarmed at being handled
by a stranger  i suppose 
and phena 
yes  yes 
they are a little frightened 
aren t you  my poor dears 
never mind 
they ll soon get used to you 
can you whistle 
whistle  ma am 
yes  whistle tunes 
a little 
then you will have to practice
every day 
i think a lot of my fowls  but there are
also my bullfinches to consider 
i had a young lad who whistled
to them very well  but he left 
they ve been neglected for days 
master alec whistled to them
this morning  ma am 
him 
nor art nor nature ever created
a lovelier thing than you  cousin tess 
to see that pretty mouth
pouting and puffing away   
   without producing a single note 
  it is all a part of my work  sir 
  never mind  i ll teach you 
i won t lay a finger on you 
see  i ll stay exactly where i am 
now you watch me 
don t screw up your lips too tight 
do it like this 
blow gently 
gently 
try 
no  no  try again 
again 
there  you ll manage splendidly
now i ve started you off 
tell me  tess  don t you find
my mother a little odd 
i hardly know her  sir 
well  i m not in her good books
at the moment 
but you should find favor
if you treat her livestock well 
if you meet with any difficulties   
   don t go to dollop   
   come to me 
what  don t you fancy
a dance  then 
i m mortal tired 
  when are you all going home 
  soon enough  soon enough 
well  my beauty 
what are you doing here
this time of night 
i m waiting for the others  sir   
   not being acquainted
with the road home 
i only have a saddle horse 
come to the inn with me 
i ll hire a trap for us both 
no  no  thank you 
but i promised to wait for them 
very well  silly girl 
please yourself 
what s that creeping
down your back 
well  i declare 
it is treacle 
  you dare laugh at me  you hussy 
  i can t help it 
no more than the others 
you think you re the queen
of trantridge   
   just because you re first favorite
with him 
she never said anything 
leave her 
i ll show you  i m worth two of your
sort for all your airs and graces 
if i d known what sort you were   
   i d never have lowered myself
by accepting your company 
  i ll show you 
  hey there  workfolk 
what s all the row about 
quickly  jump up beside me 
out of the frying pan  into the fire 
  where are we 
  passing through the chase 
the chase 
it is out of our way  surely 
this forest is one of the oldest
and loveliest in england  tess 
don t you think it deserves
to be seen   
   on a glorious god given
night like this 
yes  but    
no buts  there s a good girl 
i ll be honest with you 
i m happy 
i m trying to prolong the moment 
you were shivering a while back 
now i can feel your warmth
against me 
  are you still cold 
  no  not now 
i ll let my animal
walk a little further 
he ll make better progress
once he s rested 
tell me   
     what news of your parents  horse 
  they have no horse 
they have since monday last 
  did you    
  forgive me for mentioning it 
i thought they would have
written to you 
  i don t know what to say 
  it s nothing 
i knew how important it was
for your father to have a new horse 
really 
it s you he should thank 
i m grateful to you 
truly i am 
but i almost wish
you hadn t done this 
yes  i almost do 
  is that a reproach 
  oh  no 
it is very kind of you  i m sure 
i ve been in torment
ever since you came to us 
  then i ll leave tomorrow  sir 
  that s absurd 
i don t want you to leave 
that s the last thing i want 
is there no hope for me 
none at all 
tess 
i m dying for you 
can t you see 
forgive me 
oh  please forgive me 
  are you hurt 
  no  it s nothing  nothing 
you re bleeding 
oh  my god 
how ever could i have
done such a thing 
it s me 
don t be so foolish 
open the door 
you ll force me
to make a noise  tess 
my mother has sharp ears 
she ll hear 
enough of this nonsense  darling 
open up 
why sneak away   
   like a thief 
and at this hour in the morning 
nobody would ve prevented
you leaving 
at least let me drive you home 
unless you d care to come back 
i shan t come back 
  what are you crying for 
  i was only thinking   
   i was born over there 
well  we all have
to be born somewhere 
i   i wish i d never been born 
  there or anywhere else 
  you re absurdly melancholy  tess 
you can hold your own for beauty
against any woman 
queen or commoner 
i tell you that as a practical man
who wishes you well 
if you re wise  you ll let the world
get a clearer sight of that beauty   
   before it fades 
why not make the most of life 
we didn t fare so badly
together  did we 
  i was blinded for a while  that s all 
  that s what all women say 
how dare you talk like that 
has it never struck you what all
women say  some women may feel 
  all right  i was wrong  i admit it 
  please  please stop 
i should like to get down here 
i m a bad lot  i suppose 
a damn bad lot 
i was born bad 
and i warrant i ll die bad 
listen  tess   
   if circumstances should arise 
do you understand 
if you re ever in the least trouble 
the least difficulty   
   just send me one line  and you shall
have whatever you need by return 
you really won t come back 
goodbye  my four months  cousin 
goodbye 
tess 
it is no use her pretending
she hates it   
   and wishes it in the churchyard
and herself beside it 
she loves that child of hers 
poor little mite 
it don t look long for this world 
good evening  durbeyfield 
  what s your business 
  my business 
the child  i must baptize it before
the lord gathers it to his bosom 
what child are you speaking of 
all my children are baptized 
you ought to know 
durbeyfield  don t play games
with the almighty 
i don t play  sir  i work 
i work  like a beast of the field 
you can tell the almighty that
from me 
  my baby s dying 
  you ought to have been more careful 
like it or not  jack 
that child was born 
it is here  under your own roof 
  not true 
  father  come to your senses 
for pity s sake  let the vicar in 
he shan t set foot inside this house 
not over my dead body 
there s enough disgrace
on my name as it is 
o merciful god  take pity 
take pity on him 
send down your anger on me 
but have mercy on my child 
my child 
i should like to ask you
something  sir 
well  speak  girl  i m listening 
each of us shares
in your sad affliction  my child 
we re all members
of the suffering body of christ 
my son was baptized 
baptized  by whom 
by me  last night 
what procedure did you follow 
i woke my little brothers
and sisters   
   and made them
kneel down to pray 
 liza lu held the prayer book open 
i lit a candle 
and then 
then i held my child like this
over the basin 
yes 
i poured some water on his forehead 
and i said 
 i baptize thee   
   in the name of the father 
son and holy ghost  
  did you make the sign of the cross 
  yes  i did that too 
will it be just the same
as if you d baptized him 
in the sight of god  i mean 
yes  my dear girl 
it will be the same 
then you ll give him
a christian burial 
that s another matter 
another matter  why 
well  that would concern
the village as a whole 
not just the two of us 
you understand 
won t you do it  sir 
just this once 
i m sorry 
i beg you  please 
i told you 
it s out of the question 
then i don t like you 
i shall never come
to your church again 
never 
never 
  hey  mr  crick 
  eh 
what  here already 
we didn t expect you afore tomorrow 
it is quite a step from here
to weatherbury 
  marlott  sir  i come from marlott 
  yes  marlott 
well  that s even further 
quite sure you can stand it here 
it is comfortable enough
for rough folk   
   but we don t live
in a cowcumber frame 
i m accustomed to that 
i used to know your part
of the county when i were a lad 
good  right you are 
well  you ll want a rest
and a morsel of food 
i d rather begin now 
to get my hand in 
oh  come on 
you must be famished 
no  thank you 
a little milk will suffice 
well  if you can swallow that 
so be it 
it is what i hain t touched for years 
it lies in my innards like lead 
to my thinking  the beasts
aren t giving all they should 
that s because there s
a new hand come amongst us 
i ve known it happen afore 
they do say that the milk goes up
into their horns at such times 
anyone would think we were
back in the middle ages 
i don t appear to be making
much progress 
take it gentle  sir  take it gentle 
whoa  now 
  it is skill that does it  not strength 
  so my aching fingers tell me 
mrs  crick s too proud to come
milking with us  and that s a fact 
still  there s little enough
to wherrit about 
and we do eat like gamecocks 
no  you ll like it here 
mr  crick  he s a very kindly man 
just fancy  he has his own
family pew in church 
dairyman dick all the week
on sundays  mr  richard crick
who s that playing 
mr  clare 
mr  clare 
him that s learning to milk 
angel clare  he s called 
angel 
it is no common name 
he never says much to us 
more s the pity 
why 
does he scorn common folk 
quite the opposite 
he often makes mock of old families 
it is quite simple 
he s a parson s son
with a mind to be a farmer 
he s already tried his hand
at sheep farming 
now he s learning dairy work
with mr  crick 
but what does he hold against
old families 
he says they re   
   worm eaten 
that be your soul trying to escape 
it is bread  that s all 
no  it is when you sneeze 
you re like to blow your soul away 
as i see it  no soul can leave
its mortal shell afore a body dies 
what if a man falls down
in a faint  master crick 
well  that s a different matter 
the spirit bides there inside you 
but you cannot feel it 
but we can sometimes make
our souls leave our bodies 
how s that  then  maidy 
only have to lie
on the grass at night   
   and look straight up
at some bright star 
and stare at it with all your might 
and by and by  you ll feel
you re falling into the sky   
   miles and miles from your body   
   which you ll don t seem
to need at all 
tess 
why run away like that 
  are you afraid 
  no  sir  not of outdoor things  no 
  but you have your indoor fears  eh 
  heavens  yes 
of what 
i couldn t rightly say 
of the milk turning sour 
no 
fear of life  in general 
yes  sir 
so have i  very often 
life s a puzzle  don t you think 
perhaps   
   now you put it that way 
it is no use  it won t take 
if this continues  i shall have
to call on conjurer trendle 
i don t say i believe in him  mind 
but if nothing else works 
i shall have to try it  shan t i 
somebody here s in love  i ll be bound 
that can cause it  so i ve heard 
conjurer fall 
to the side of casterbridge 
he had the knack of it
when i was a lad 
it is a pity  he must be feeding
the worms by now 
my grandpa used to go to conjurer
mynterne out at owlscombe 
but there s no folk
like him these days 
somebody s in love  i tell you 
  what s the matter 
  the blasted butter won t come 
  why is that 
  to my mind  
how warm it is today 
i think i d be better out of doors 
they do say it happens
when people are in love 
i remember as a girl    
don t push 
he looks so sad 
whatever can he be thinking of 
well  not of us 
you can rely on that 
you re a fine one to talk  izz 
  i saw you 
  what did you see 
it was the other day 
i saw you kissing his shadow 
here he comes again 
dear eyes    
dear face    
dear mr  clare 
it is terrible to think he ll never wed
any one of us 
more likely  he ll ask us to milk
his cows for so much a year 
what are we going to do 
we shall have to take
the stone bridge road 
we ll be late 
  doesn t he go to church 
  no  never 
i wish he would 
you look like cats afraid of water 
only on account
of our sunday best  sir 
very well  i ll carry you
just as you are 
no  no  i m far too heavy 
nonsense  i could carry
all four of you at once 
hold on to me  that s it 
i should put my arms around
his neck and look into his eyes 
there s nothing in that 
there s a time for everything
under heaven 
a time to kiss and a time to cuddle 
shame on you  izz 
that s scripture 
i always heed the prettiest
verses in church 
if you helped me  perhaps i could
climb along the bank 
tess 
i ve gone to three quarters of this
trouble for your sake alone 
she s angry  she doesn t understand 
she ll kick over the bucket 
forgive me  my darling tess 
i don t know what came over me 
there s only one excuse for it 
i love you 
yes  i love you 
angel 
angel 
hello  mercy  forgive me 
i didn t see you 
forgive me 
welcome home 
  how are you 
  very well 
god be praised  you look radiant
with health  i see 
the open air  probably 
have you come to spend
the holidays with your brothers 
are they here  i had no idea 
no  i m only paying my parents a brief
visit to settle some urgent business 
then i won t detain you 
i have my bible class
to take  in any case 
au revoir  angel 
  angel 
  angel  my boy 
i apologize  father  i had no time
to warn you of my arrival 
perhaps you ve forgotten how
to write  with a pen  remember 
i brought you farmhouse delicacies 
black puddings
and a bottle of mead 
black puddings 
it s true your mother and i
have regretted   
   hearing so little of your news 
you must bear with him  father 
spending all his time
with sheep and cattle   
   takes one closer to nature
but further from oxford 
i would remind you  felix   
   that a university education
means nothing   
   unless it redounds
to the glory of god 
it can also redound
to the glory of man 
only in the second place 
how far are you
in your apprenticeship 
it s drawing to a close 
what counts is spiritual cleanliness 
isn t that so  father 
the two go together  my boy 
father tells us you intend
setting up on your own 
yes 
  in what part of the world 
  i don t know yet 
the colonies perhaps 
heaven preserve us 
it would suit the type of
farming i have in mind 
  what colony 
  the choice is wide 
or i may settle in a foreign country 
some places offer land to immigrants
on very favorable terms 
brazil  for example 
wonders will never cease 
nothing s settled yet 
i came here to discuss it 
that among other things 
shall we take a drop of good
mrs  crick s delicious mead 
oh  forgive me  i forgot 
strong drink is the root of all evil 
take us into your confidence 
  is it something serious 
  not serious  but important 
the truth is   
   don t you think it s time
i considered marrying 
yes  indeed  my boy  yes  indeed 
your mother and i have debated
the same question 
really  and what sort of wife
would you favor   
     for a budding farmer like myself 
  a truly christian  god fearing woman 
one who will be a help and
a comfort to you in all things 
  the rest matters little 
  you mustn t hesitate  dear son 
not hesitate 
to marry your heart s desire 
mercy chant 
she may be rather
fond of overdecorating a church   
   with fripperies  flowers 
scraps of lace and so forth   
   but that s merely a girlish fancy 
it ll pass 
mercy is a pure and virtuous girl 
oh  yes  i know she s pure
and virtuous 
but honesty compels me to inform you
that i have other plans 
  other plans 
  very much so 
mercy chant appeals more to you
than she does to me 
i m not disputing her merits 
i m speaking of my own inclinations 
my dearest boy 
angel  please remember
you re addressing your parents 
i m aware of that 
i already know the woman
i intend to marry 
her name is teresa durbeyfield 
father  mother  i respect you both 
i also respect mercy chant
and have no doubt   
   she ll find a worthy husband
with or without your help 
as for me   
   my mind s made up 
  it is you 
  tess 
i want to ask you this now 
will you be my wife 
i love you with all my heart
and soul 
but what s the matter 
i    
i cannot    
i cannot be your wife 
  don t you love me 
  oh  yes  yes 
i would rather belong to you
than to anyone in the world 
but forgive me 
i cannot marry you 
it was the good lord who put this
nice young parson s son your way 
you must believe that 
but with respect to your question   
   i tell you quite private
but very strong   
   on no account say a word
about your bygone trouble 
never a word  my girl 
least of all to him 
mother  mother    
tess  why does the idea
of becoming my wife   
     displease you   
  but i never said that 
it would please me so much 
  it is simply that i cannot 
  why 
is there someone else 
don t i deserve to know the truth 
  well 
  not now 
  when  then 
  later 
but why 
i ll tell you when we get home 
you may stop loving me
when you know 
let me wait till then 
londoners will drink it at their
breakfasts tomorrow  won t they 
yes  but watered down 
in case it goes to their heads 
strangers we ve never seen    
you saw me once before 
you know that 
i did 
you wouldn t dance with me 
  it was at marlott 
  of course 
  that s incredible 
  you remember now 
tessy  tessy    
  now  my girl 
  yes 
i may never again be brave
enough to tell you my story 
then get on with your precious story 
i was born at such and such a place
in such and such a year  
i was born at marlott   
   and i grew up there 
i was in the sixth form
when i left school 
they said i would make
a good teacher 
but there was trouble in my family 
father was no great worker 
he drank  and i    
my parents  they    
it was then
that something happened 
something which
changed my life  i    
they    
they discovered that we were
not durbeyfields   
   but d urbervilles 
well  go on 
well  that s it 
what 
well  the d urbervilles
are an old family 
i know 
on account of   
   being of that name 
my mother thought that    
we were sent    
  i had a  
  a what 
i was told you hated old families 
and is that all the trouble 
none of that matters  tess 
say you ll be my wife 
say it  tess  say it  my dear love 
yes  yes  yes 
my youth   
   my simplicity   
   and the strangeness
of my situation   
   may perhaps lessen my fault 
but since i committed it   
   i am guilty 
i must be guilty   
   because the lord saw fit
to take my child 
if what i havejust written   
   failed to pass my lips
in your presence   
   when i had repeated it
a thousand times in my heart   
   it was for fear
of losing you forever 
for love ofyou   
   i shall conquer that fear
and bring you this letter 
once you receive it  angel   
   you will hold the rest
of my life in your hands 
i hope   
   i tremble   
   i love you 
tess 
darling 
happiness seems to put an edge
on my appetite 
i m starving 
oh  look  they re coming 
faster  faster  mrs  crick 
they ll beat us to the church 
angel 
angel  please  i must speak to you 
what s the matter 
i want to confess
all my past faults  all of it 
later  sweetheart  once we re married
we ll tell each other everything 
i have some failings
of my own to confess 
i require and charge you both   
   as you will have to answer
at that dreadful day of judgment   
   where the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed 
that if either of you know
any impediment   
   why you may not be lawfully
joined in matrimony   
   ye do now confess it 
wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife   
   to live together after god s
just ordinance   
   in the holy estate of matrimony 
wilt thou love her  comfort her 
honor and keep her   
   in sickness and in health
and forsaking all other   
   keep thee only unto her 
so long as ye both shall live 
i will 
welcome  sir  welcome  ma am 
mr  plunkett told me to make
you at home 
the rooms you rented
are on the first floor   
   but mr  plunkett had to leave
for manchester   
   so you ll have the whole house
to yourselves 
you ll find it very comfortable here 
the house is inclined to be damp 
but i lit a good fire in the drawing
room early this afternoon 
as for food  look 
i ve prepared you a cold supper 
and there s a nice bottle of wine
to go with it 
tomorrow  if you wish   
   i ll bring you some of my husband s
excellent cider  he makes it himself 
the usual offices 
your bedroom 
a little surprise  ma am 
i took the liberty  my son picked it
in the woods  it s a good bed 
i think you ll find it to your liking 
and now i ll leave you to yourselves 
cheerio 
which are my hands 
and which are yours 
they re all yours 
open it 
it s for you 
family jewels 
  are they for me 
  but of course 
truly 
put them on 
put them on now 
my god  how beautiful you are 
come and see 
i have a confession to make 
my love 
  you have something to confess 
  why not 
you think far too highly of me 
listen 
i want you to forgive me   
   and not be angry with me
for failing to tell you earlier 
i said nothing for fear of losing you 
i shall be brief  darling 
not long before we met   
   i lived in london for a time 
there   
   i met a woman older than myself 
ours was a false relationship 
a sad one 
it was all over in a few weeks 
that s all there is to tell 
do you forgive me 
angel    
you re so utterly good and gentle 
i was mad to fear your resentment 
i have a confession too  angel 
something of the same kind 
tell me at table  we ll talk over
supper  i m hungry  aren t you 
i told you   
   i have a confession like your own 
what confession 
i shall be just as brief 
his name is d urberville 
like mine 
alexander d urberville 
his family bought the title 
their real name is stoke 
it was fate that drove me to work   
   for false relations as a way
of helping my own folk to live 
alec    
alexander   
   took advantage of me   
   relying on his strength
and my fear 
i became his mistress in despair 
without love 
like yours   
   my sad union ended
after a few weeks 
i bore a child   
   which died very young 
my life was in ruins
till the day i met you 
i m going out 
you don t forgive me 
  i forgive you  angel 
  yes  i know 
but you    
you don t forgive me 
you were one person 
now you re another 
have mercy 
  angel 
  have mercy 
angel  what do you mean
by that laugh 
how can you speak to me like this 
it frightens me 
  how can you 
  you are not the woman i loved 
  well  who am i  then 
  another woman in her shape 
he says    
he says i m not the woman he loved   
   but another woman in her shape 
angel  angel  please 
i was a child   
   a child when it happened 
i knew nothing of men 
you were sinned against 
that i grant you 
  so you don t forgive me 
  i forgive you 
but forgiveness isn t all 
nor love me 
i cannot help associating
your lack of firmness   
   with the decline of your family 
decrepit families imply deficient
willpower and decadent conduct 
i thought you were a child of nature 
but you were the last in a line
of degenerate aristocrats 
breakfast is ready 
you can get rid of me 
what did you say 
you can get rid of me 
by divorcing me 
good god 
how can you be so simple 
you re too much of a child 
too immature 
too ignorant  i suppose 
leave that 
you re my wife  not my servant 
i m your wife   
   but you don t want
to live with me 
you mean to go  don t you 
i couldn t stay
without despising myself 
and what is worse 
without despising you 
how can we live together
while that man exists 
he is your natural husband   
   not i 
can you honestly tell me to stay 
no 
but it s absolutely necessary
that one of us remain here   
   to avoid a scandal 
we must at least
keep up appearances 
oh  yes  we must 
but what will you do 
  i can go home 
  are you sure 
yes  if you leave me 
i shall go home 
then so be it 
  cross in hand  sir 
  yes  i know 
come 
now  let s be clear about this 
there s no anger in our hearts 
even though something happened   
   between us which i cannot
endure at present 
i shall let you know where i go 
and if i think i can bear it   
   if i m capable of it 
i shall come to fetch you 
i shall wait 
until then  you d do better
not to try and join me 
until then  i must not join you 
just so 
  may i write to you 
  oh  yes 
if you re ill or in need of anything 
a very good day to you  mr  clare 
i ve brought you some groceries 
there s a chicken 
some sausages  some bacon 
  thank you so much 
  i ve put in some butter   
     some flour  eggs  
  that s too much 
newlyweds are always hungry  sir 
from tonight onwards 
i shall cook for you myself 
the truth is  you see  for some time 
i shall be needing less 
because  in fact  i shall be alone
for a day or two 
my wife has been obliged
to rejoin her parents 
mercy on us 
is there an illness in the family 
nothing of that kind 
it was arranged beforehand 
so as far as my meals are concerned
during mrs  clare s absence   
     i ll talk to you later 
  shall i leave the basket 
indeed  the basket will do for today 
many thanks 
i was passing on my way home  sir 
i only wanted to wish you well 
you and mrs  clare 
she s not here  i m on the point
of leaving myself  as you see 
i m leaving england 
i ve made up my mind to go to brazil 
  brazil 
  yes 
well  then please tell mrs  clare
i hope the journey agrees with her 
she s not going at present  i ll go on
to get the measure of the place   
   and see what life there is like 
  how is retty 
  oh  as high strung as ever 
  and marian 
  marian s taken to drink  sir 
  really 
  yes  mr  crick has got rid of her 
and you  izz  are you well 
with you gone  sir  how could i be 
there  it is said 
goodbye  sir 
goodbye  izz 
izz 
if i were to ask you
to come with me now   
   come to brazil with me   
   would your answer be yes 
to come with you  i should
leave everything this minute 
you know what it would mean
in the eyes of society 
i wouldn t care 
do you love me so much 
i ve   i ve always loved you 
more than tess 
no 
not more than her 
nobody could have loved you
more than tess 
she d have given her life for you 
i could do no more 
all is vanity 
  good night  my pretty 
  night  sir 
it is late for a maid to be
roaming the lanes by herself 
have you lost your way  then 
step up here beside me 
and i ll take you part of the road 
why  you can scarce put
one foot afore the other 
ride with me  i say 
but i know you 
you be mr  stoke d urberville s
fancy woman 
you weren t too proud
to cock a leg for him  eh 
trollop 
if it isn t my little tess 
poor poppet  what a state you re in 
you re so cold 
here 
get that inside you 
it will warm your bones 
go on  my love  drink it

you mustn t let yourself go 
even bad luck runs out in the end 
take my word for it 
i can t go on 
you ll feel better tomorrow 
oh  no  i can t go on 
i d like    
if i had the courage  i d like to die 
don t talk such flummery 
why didn t you come
to see me sooner 
i m going to take you in hand 
my girl 
  do they still have work here 
  in this wretched place 
there s always work here
for them as can abide it 
come  you have some
of my nice soup 
after that   
   you must take off those slummocky
clothes and prettify yourself   
   just to make me jealous again 
my little tessy 
are you the new hand 
it is you  is it 
be they all you ve done 
it is a mighty poor show 
  she s not accustomed to it 
  i don t keep useless hands here 
we re only paid for what we do 
so where s the difference 
no arguments 
i want the whole lot cleared 
i ll stay late 
you d better 
never you mind that groby 
it is just his way 
no  lord love us 
it is not like it was at the dairy 
dairyman dick all the week
on sundays  mr  richard crick
it don t do to pray here  missy 
there be a curse on this place 
  this is the cross in hand  isn t it 
  so it is 
on account of a malefactor
they tortured here in ancient times 
they did nail his hand to a post 
and then they hanged him 
the sinner s bones be down
there to this day  i m told 
oh  my dear  what do you think
of these kind people 
tuesday  delighted 
  goodbye 
  till evening 
what 
what are you finding 
an old pair of boots 
are there two of them 
  yes 
  well  how extraordinary 
still in good condition 
it s wicked to throw away
a good pair of boots like that 
they could be of use to the poor 
  you must take them home with you 
  i will 
  they re a little muddy 
  yes 
sir 
over there  mr  groby 
i knew nothing
of your circumstances 
nothing at all
until your mother wrote me 
  my mother 
  she wrote   
   what you should have told me
a long time ago 
i came at once 
tess 
why did you never say anything 
i had nothing to ask of you 
that isn t so 
you wear your ridiculous pride
like a hair shirt 
and you ve put me even more
in the wrong than i was 
against my will 
i d have done my duty by the child 
on my honor  i would 
honor 
i want to take you away
from this wretched place 
it s unworthy of you 
what is this strange temptation
misery holds for you 
come to your senses 
come away with me 
your father s ill 
did you know 
yes 
they fear the worst 
your family will be evicted if he dies 
they re quite as destitute as you 
i m offering you my help  sincerely 
no one else seems to care 
who is this husband
of yours anyway 
  how could he abandon you like this 
  please leave me alone 
tess 
there s a point beyond which
obstinacy becomes stupidity 
are you in love with this drudgery 
i may be a sham d urberville 
but my finger can do more for you   
   than all your blue blooded
ancestors 
i m right 
you know i am 
forget about all this 
and forget about that mule
you call your husband 
go on  hit me 
i shall not cry out 
once victim  always victim 
that s the law 
i was your master once 
i shall be so again 
if you re any man s wife   
   you re mine 
my own dear husband   
my own dear husband   
   i shall die soon unless
i get word from you 
all my letters have
remained unanswered 
have you even received them 
i long for one thing only   
   and that is to see you again 
come back to me  angel 
come back and save me from
the thing that threatens me 
any reasonable person would
call this a ludicrous situation 
i offer to help you   
   you and all your family 
but no 
you prefer to turn
yourselves into gypsies 
please go away 
in other words  mrs  clare   
   you re asking me
to let you starve in peace 
go away 
you ll be civil yet 
what s to become of me
and my poor little mites 
we be the durbeyfield family 
it is written there  isn t it 
oh  it is written plain enough 
i grant you   
   but the rooms have been taken 
you never sent the deposit 
he means the money to be
paid on account  mother 
there s more in life than money  sir 
you cannot leave these fatherless
children in the street 
  it would be a crime 
  missus 
hospitality s sacred 
even among the pagan turks 
please  missus  it is your own fault 
we ll see about that 
we re true descendants
of the knightly d urbervilles 
nobody leaves us in the streets
like horse apples   
   not in the home of our ancestors 
our bones are in the crypt there 
laid out in their coffins 
  mother  i beg you  don t take on so 
  no  my girl  what s true is true 
your poor father s eyes are on us 
we mustn t shame him 
the lord will protect his own 
and the wicked shall be punished 
bain t you stopping here  then 
no  my good man  we re going on 
good man  my beasts are spent 
i ought to be getting back to marlott 
no  wait  wait 
now  unload it all 
  where 
  here 
  here 
  yes  here 
we shall camp beside our church   
   until the town of our ancestors
finds us shelter 
now  come on  children 
set to work 
why am i on the wrong
side of this door 
  who s there 
  it s me  father  angel 
my boy  my poor boy 
i ve been ill 
but i m quite all right now 
why have you treated me
so monstrously  angel 
i do not deserve it 
i have thought it over carefully   
   and i can never  never forgive you 
you are cruel 
i shall try to forget you 
all i have received at
your hands is injustice 
mr  durbeyfield 
beg pardon

since when 
since john durbeyfield died

 john durbeyfield  1832 to 1888 
more properly d urberville

family of that name   
   and descended through
an illustrious line   
   from sir pagan d urberville 
one of the knights of the conqueror 
how are the mighty fallen  
oh  yes  how indeed 
may i  for the poor

good morning  my dear 
well  what s the matter now 
are you feeling unwell 
is that why you have the vapors 
yes 
no 
yes  i know 
we re moping as usual 
for god s sake 
try and make an effort 
did you have a bad dream 
brazil  perhaps 
these morning hysterics
of yours are in poor taste 
don t forget we re lunching
with the bennetts 
i d like you to look presentable 
a genuine d urberville 
i came to tell you that i ve killed him 
i ve done it 
i don t know how 
i don t know 
that   that time i hit him
with my glove 
the blood in his mouth 
i thought i might be capable of    
yes 
yes  it was from that day on 
what do you mean 
i mean i ve killed him 
i won t desert you 
i shall protect you by every
means in my power 
whatever you may or may
not have done  i love you 
i love you 
will they hang me 
we must get out at the next
station and head north on foot 
they ll be looking for us
in the wessex ports 
once we reach the north 
we ll go abroad 
i have the makings of a meal here 
even a bottle of wine 
rest at last 
we must leave at once 
we must leave here as soon as possible 
my life couldn t be a matter of weeks 
why not wait for them here 
since they ll catch me in any case 
i m going to save you 
do you hear 
i m going to save you 
can t we rest here 
i m afraid not  by day this place
is visible from miles around 
there are no stars tonight 
perhaps we could have made
our souls take flight together 
do they sacrifice to god here 
no  to the sun i believe 
it s a pagan temple
