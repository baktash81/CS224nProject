thanks 
bye 
  did you wait long 
  no 
what do you think 
i was hot and thirsty 
that s all 
careful 
it s wet 
you re so tiring 
i would have preferred
doing otherwise 
or living otherwise 
but i let myself get
overcome by things   
things foreign to me 
they settled in   
little by little   
they destroyed my hope 
they began to rule 
you can understand
that when i was young   
this wasn t the life i dreamed of 
i didn t dream of this life
because i wasn t this person 
i was full of
joy and energy 
you didn t know me  pierre 
as soon as you were born 
my youth fell apart 
i have the impression
that my life today   
doesn t correspond
to my true nature 
i have the impression
i haven t changed 
still full of
joy and energy 
but unable to
prove it to others 
alone in my joy and energy 
that s pretty awful 
your mother is like me 
i don t mean she s awful 
she simply hasn t
changed either 
like me  she wears a mask 
she s pretty
tired these days 
  physically  she s fine 
  can i go now 
  want me to carry your bag 
  no 
  give me the box 
  no  it s ok 
you lost weight 
you look bad 
i m so happy to see you 
  i missed you  marthe 
  me  too 
grandma sent this cheese 
your mother is upstairs 
  it s heavy 
  no problem 
the pool 
you re soaked 
is that all you can say 
i ll show you around 
i think i ll go
shopping this afternoon 
and you 
i don t know 
you can t stay inside the house
all afternoon  pierre 
she just fell down 
surely too much sun 
or maybe she slipped 
pierre   
did he hit her 
marthe  did he hit her 
tell me if he hit her 
what are you talking about 
be careful when you get
up tomorrow morning 
be very careful 
pierre 
your father said goodbye 
he had to leave for france 
on business 
where in france

back to his mistress 
pierre 
what s come over you 
keep those thoughts
to yourself  please 
don t get mad 
it doesn t bother me either 
i m happy to be
here alone with you 
don t exaggerate 
i swear 
i have you all to myself 
how about this afternoon 
going to the beach 
with you 
where s my mother 
what s come over you 
mom  you can t stay here 
why did he bring you here 
  want to sit 
  no  thanks

taken for your lover 
you re ashamed

among women

fruit of thy womb 
holy mary  mother of god

plane for nantes

we ll rent a car   
or if we ll be picked up 
what happened 
if you speak to marthe
or robert  don t forget   
you re supposed to be sad 
no need to cry 
but at least look down 
you re still young 
you ll start again 
listen  pierre 
i don t expect you to
comfort me like that 
imbecile 
  little john dances 
he dances like this     
ji with his dick  he ll dance 
with his dick  he ll dance   
  with his finger  finger  finger 
with his hand  hand  hand   
ji with his elbow  elbow  elbow 
with his head  head  head   
j  with his dick  dick  dick   
with his ass  ass  ass   
  this is the way little john
dances   
in istanbul  we
were happiest 
you can t remember 
you were too little 
but those three years
we lived there   
ideal 
the turks are wonderful 
not like what people say 
they re good 
nothing like the spanish 
they re the empty
core of life 
living next to them
is already stooping low 
then just leave 
i will leave 
and go where 
july 
that s us 
  those who are born in july  ji
ji rise  rise  rise  ji
drink  drink  drink 
  she s one of us   
  she downs  
a glass like anyone   
  she s a drunk   
you can tell from her face   
one more time 
one more time 
pierre   
look at me 
you re too young 
i shouldn t speak to you like this 
your father is dead 
i won t lie to you anymore 
you must admit that
i m worse than him 
i don t deserve
your respect 
what do you think i ve been doing
every afternoon all these years 
why were you raised
by your grandmother 
what did you imagine 
look at me  pierre 
i m a bitch 
a slut 
no one respects me 
your father knew 
he allowed it 
if you really love me  then
admit that i m disgusting 
i want you to
love me for that 
for the shame i
inspire in you 
pierre 
pierre 
i m over here 
i drank too much 
but i m still ok   
i didn t vomit on you 
he stinks 
doesn t he wash 
has his room been aired 
no 
when i enter 
he starts screaming 
he has to go out 
he needs exercise 
what will you prescribe 
for now  only vitamins 
at his age  i won t
give him relaxants 
that s ridiculous 
first  he has to get out more
and change his eating habits 
he should go out 
he should eat   
how long does it take to
become a doctor in spain 
he doesn t have fever
or other symptoms 
you want my medical opinion 
nothing s wrong with him 
he just doesn t care 
fine 
what do i owe you 
nothing 
for this  nothing 
nothing 
get out of here 
leave me alone 
get out 
are you sure you
told me everything 
  you seem nervous 
  shut up 
not a word 
out of bed now 
i m changing the sheets 
here 
clean pajamas 
  what s wrong 
  these are dad s 
i m not scolding
you  sweetie 
i m not scolding you 
you re going out

why watch over a
son who isn t sick   
and wants to make me crazy 
i d take you with me 
but i don t feel like waiting 
here   
the key to your
father s study 
i don t have the strength
to get rid of his junk 
i m counting on
you to do it 
throw it all out 
except what interests you 
the small key
opens the desk 
ok 
go on 
you ll make me late 
still love me 
i love you more
than anything 
go on

we ll call grandma and
tell her you re going home 
let s lay here 
  give me some room 
  yeah  okay 
i know you re
horribly unhappy 
mom

your father was
weak like you 
maybe now you know desire
reduces us to weakness 
but you don t know
yet what i know 
  so tell me 
  no  pierre 
you mustn t learn from me 
if you knew 
you d forgive me 
you d even forgive
your father 
i want you to
enjoy your life 
i don t think
you re happy enough 
i want to know
what you know 
i don t want you ever
looking this bad 
you know what rea calls you 
rea 
you know her 
she s the brunette who
picks me up sometimes 
yeah  i guess so   
what does she say 
she calls you the
sad faced knight 
not too clever 
you two would get along 
she s only a
few years older 
she s the wildest
girl i know 
i ll put you in her hands 
she ll perfect
your education 
mom 
let your mother do 
will you 
loving your mother
isn t everything   
nor being intelligent 
nor being handsome 
nor being
frighteningly serious 
where will that take you if
you ignore the joy of others 
you re serious  too 
it s a mask  idiot 
i invited rea for a drink

i was thinking of
your father s death

a good death 
and are you ok 
fine 
i went to church 
oh  pierre 
don t start that again 
it s ok 
i m happy 
everything s fine 
  were you happy yesterday 
 yes 
even if everything will
have to be disrupted 
the pleasure only begins the
moment the worm is in the fruit 
while praying  i decided
to do what rea wants 
that deserves a toast 
bring on the bottles 
to your loves with rea 
she still makes me afraid 
the three of us
will dine together 
you ll spend the
night with her 
  you re going to leave me 
  no 
i won t leave you 
i ll have fun on my own 
get the drinks 
pierre   
do you know your
mother is nuts 
yes 
  don t leave us after dinner 
  yes 
no 
i ll be sad if you go away 
i m not your age anymore 
you two will have
more fun without me 
i wouldn t want an old
mother to hurt my fun 
you re not an old mother 
i must be  since i remember
being the worst child ever 
don t wild daughters
always become old mothers 
i was wild 
really  a wild child 
i ran alone in the woods 
i m just as wild today 
you re probably right   
i might not be
an old mother 
horseback riding
in the woods   
i rode bareback 
i threw off my clothes 
pierre 
are you listening 
i freed the horse
in the woods 
that s when i slept
with your father 
i wasn t your age 
i was and full of rage 
your father found me
naked in the woods 
he thought my horse and
i were woodland beasts 
your father hardly
counted in the story 
i preferred being alone 
i was alone in the woods 
i was naked 
i mounted naked 
i was in a state i ll
know again only at death 
i dreamed of game
and wildlife 
i prayed they
would disturb me 
your father disturbed me 
my child  my
woodland child   
from woodland foliage  from
the moistness of my pleasure   
i didn t want your father 
when he found me
naked  he forced me 
i bloodied his
face  you know 
i wanted to scratch
his eyes out 
mom 
i failed 
i wasn t thirteen yet 
not at all 
if only i had been thirteen 
we had already been
married five years 
he spent his days
spying on me 
i think he always loved me 
helene

look  i m going over there
for a minute 
 indistinct stage announcer

helene

should i 
kiss me

who pretend otherwise

  don t  robert 
my ass 
want to slap my ass 
slap it 
no 
too bad 
i m warning you   
you have twenty
minutes to disappear 
twenty minutes 
if not  i ll waste you both 
i swear 
think we could
get some coffee 
and as they did not
like to acknowledge god 
god delivered them over
to a discerning mind 
to do unsuitable things 
being filled with   
all injustice  wickedness 
covetousness  maliciousness 
full of envy 
homicidal thoughts   
strife  deceit  bad habits 
whisperers  revilers 
enemies of god 
some   
who understand
the law of god   
still practice
such actions   
they are worthy of death 
they not only do them  but even
commend those who practice them   
no  stay there 
don t come in 
we went a little far 
no use regretting it 
but you re too young 
too close to the
time you prayed 
it s not my fault 
in an ideal world  a pure
friendship would unite us 
but there s no ideal world 
i m exactly how
you saw me  pierre 
that s how i want to
remain in your eyes 
i want to be that
mother for you 
now  listen 
i don t want to see you 
we could never live together
without this disorder 
because of this disorder we
can t see each other now 
don t put on your
serious face  please 
what we did   
it would be insane
to do it again 
but being next to you 
i ll only dream of doing it again 
i know you don t
judge me now 
you must remain
faithful to me 
even if we re thousands
of kilometers apart 
we must refuse together the
world of those patiently waiting   
for death to enlighten them 
we must turn our backs
to them with pride 
take care of the house 
remember the code 
don t disappoint me  pierre 
i ll phone you 
go 
go on 
bless me 
you scare me 
would you accept to be
the mother of a god 
to be mary 
why are sons always
asked to be gods 
sorry 
i thought no one was around 
i let myself in 
hold on  i m coming 
i didn t hear you 
so your mother left 
i came to give her the key 
am i bothering you 
no 
are you ok 
you don t seem ok 
i m fine 
are you expecting someone 
no 
i m alone 
am i bugging you 
want something to drink 
are you that unhappy 
sorry 
i guess if i
was able to cry 
this would be less
uncomfortable 
maybe we should go out 
to yumbo 
no 
did my mother tell you
to take care of me 
yes 
i obeyed 
it intimidated me   
it excited me 
she assured me you d
feel just as awkward 
that s why i said yes 
what are we
supposed to do now 
have fun 
  we re off to a bad start 
  on the contrary 
you should take
me in your arms 
do i disgust you 
please don t tease me 
so you ll disappear
as you appeared 
one day  i met this guy   
he asked me if i was
who he thought i was 
 what are you thinking  
i asked him 
 i think you re a
young pig   he said 
i told him yes 
i told him i was a pig 
we saw each other often 
for a month 
around times 
he fed me 
he force fed me 
i gained about 8 kilos 
i was forbidden to wash 
that s disgusting 
you get used to it 
i ended up liking it 
he made me eat all
kinds of stuff 
sometimes cat food 
then one day he tied me up 
he told me   you re
ready for the slaughter  
he had this huge
butcher s knife 
he started sharpening it
slowly right under my nose 
i got real excited 
you weren t afraid 
he was weird  but not
in the dangerous way 
actually kind of sweet 
after each hit   
he always had this look 
this pause for an ok
so he could continue 
what did he do with
his knife afterwards 
he bled me 
from under my belly button 
it didn t really hurt 
the blood dripped slowly 
he collected it in a
little plastic bowl 
he said he was going to
make a blood sausage 
then he pointed the
knife at my throat 
i got really scared 
i panicked 
i started to scream 
he said   squeal  squeal  
i really thought
it was over 
i passed out 
lost consciousness 
i think that s why he
didn t go all the way 
the next day  he told me
that i wasn t serious enough 
he wanted real young
pigs to slaughter 
he showed me the door 
kicked me out 
i think that guy really
killed these two young belgians 
he showed me these chunks
of meat in his freezer 
 this is frank   he said 
 that s richard
next to him  
he wanted to excite you 
maybe 
all i know  it
really worked 
where can i find the coffee 
yea  yea   
i m coming 
hansi   
your friends kind
of freak me out 
i only know loulou 
want them to leave 
what exactly are we
doing all together

would be easier in a group 
i d prefer it if they left 
ok 
then make coffee

not at all 
don t smoke in my room  please 
hello 
hello 
spanish 
where s your mom 
are you italian 
i m going for a walk 
sometimes  i can admit if i
love hansi s ass so much 
then it s because i
want god to curse it 
i now associate joy   
that faraway joy in
god that i knew   
i admit they re
both equally holy 
her ass makes me realize
i never really loved god 
i liked the idea of
being abandoned by god 
i was reciting
catechism  that s all 
god is something other
than my old prayers 
he is my way of
losing my senses 
by loving hansi  i hope
to slowly lose my senses 
in a slow way  but not
lifeless  you know 
a choppy slowness 
choppy and scalp tingling 
it doesn t always
make me happy 
i don t think i lose my
senses more with hansi   
than with god 
i don t know if you wanted
to guide me toward this slowness 
maybe you think hansi isn t
perverse enough for me 
what are you doing 
i ve been looking
one hour for you 
i m writing to my mother 
what about 
about us 
i want to read it 
you know  i don t believe
in perversion at all 
i don t want to
talk about that 
i don t believe in it simply
because it doesn t exist 
your mother knows
better than me 
are you annoyed i m
writing her that 
it makes me sad 
if you don t want me
anymore  tell me real soon 
what are you thinking 
there s no guilty pleasure 
forget that 
i m ready to do everything 
just be clear 
what do you want 
do you even know
what you want 
i love you 
i don t want you
to stoop so low 
  what do you want 
  what is there to want 
everything 
what did you do with rea 
stop it 
why 
did you do things that
you d like to do again 
and what did you
do with my mother  huh 
are you ashamed 
pierre  let s
not play that 
well  why not 
the first time  she
sent me to a hotel room 
near the golf course 
she left the door opened 
i was supposed to enter   
get completely undressed   
then get on all
fours on the carpet 
then just call for her 
go on 
she came out of
the bathroom 
she stared at me
for a long time 
then a man came out
of the bathroom 
he gave the orders 
he told your mother
what to do to me 
he wanted me blindfolded 
then your mother sniffed
me everywhere he wanted 
he said she had
to clean me up   
shut up 
shut up

locked up here

don t you hear the
hidalgos calling out to us 
no 
i hear nothing 
you re no fun an more 
y
you re becoming
deadly boring 
thanks 
you want to go home 
i want to see him 
in my opinion   
being in hansi s arms
made your son forget you 
get moving 
i m tired of
going out alone 
i ve had it 
i think it s done  rea 
it finally happened 
i ve lost the urge 
you re just depressed 
it goes deeper than that 
it s over 
i shouldn t complain 
i made the most of it 
now it s burned out 
finished 
all the more reason   
let s throw
a flamboyant funeral   
for the momentary
agony of your desire 
you know   
the last lap is
always the best 
i m not joking 
it s not a
question of desire 
i burned all my bridges 
but you re right 
he surely forgot me 
thanks 
loulou 
come here 
we ll never do it again 
i promise 
i did it a lot 
i did it in front
of your mother 
both of us whipped
loulou for whole nights 
but she forced you 
i don t know 
you have to forget 
i don t want to see
you cry anymore 
your mother made me swear
we d do it with you 
nothing can force
you to do it 
are you sure 
i really love you  pierre 
kiss him 
come and kiss him 
the three of us will
wait here for her 
we ll make her proud of us 
there s no reason
to be afraid  ok 
no reason to be afraid
