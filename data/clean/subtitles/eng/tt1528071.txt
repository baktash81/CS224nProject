that mattered was her
she was my garden of eden
and god knows how beawutiful
it was until that night
no no one is born evil
the devil himself

when you go through hell
the only way out is to walk
deeper into the fire

im gonna love you
for the rest of my life
just love me
for the rest of mine
i
i wish you could swim

like dolphins can swim
though nothing
nothing will
keep us together
we can beat them
forever and ever
oh we can be heroes
hey ig what does it feel
like to get away with murder
want to comment on the fire
at the lab in tacoma last night
have you heard that the
police have a new witness
ask god to save your soul
for what you did to her
i should ask the devil
to punish whoever
the fuck killed her
hi this is lee

at my parents house
in half an hour
i really need to talk to you
pick up the phone man come on
are you proud of me mom
im so famous
people follow me
everywhere i go
come inside sweetie
you just cant talk
to those reporters
theyll take whatever you say
and just twist it around
but if i dont talk
to them it looks like i
have something to hide right
hows lee
working out for you
you still think
hes up to the job
yes hes keeping
me out of jail
at least for the time being
which is some kind of triumph
i know hes
an old friend of yours
but you dont have to settle
for a public defender
ive got the money i will hire
you the best lawyer in seattle
every other lawyer we talked
to wanted me to take a plea
lee is the only one
who believes im innocent
just dont talk to
any more reporters please
and dont admit
anything
i dont have anything
to admit to dad
we dont care what happened
youre our son
thats all
that matters
sit back down ig
if you think for a second
that i mightve killed her
then why are you protecting me
because if i did anything
to her im a fucking monster
i got to go
ig look i
i dont have to go
back on the road
ext week if you
dont want me to
you got to earn a living
ill sort things out
except i need you
to stay terry
the whole family needs
to put up a united front for ig
hey buddy
how is it going
lee
lee
if you want any food
weve got plenty of leftovers
from lunch
i grabbed something
on the way thank yhou
how are you guys doing
yeah hum
lee what happened
at the lab in tacoma
one of the reporters this
morning told me it burned down
the samples from merrins
body were destroyed
all of the murderers
blood and dna
thats a fucking
disaster for us right
that means theres no evidence
anybody else killed her
its not ideal but theres
no need to panic at this point
and who is this new witness
what is that
im trying to figure
that out today and im also
gonna get your confession
to the police thrown out
yeah good you know
i never confessed to them
theyre just looking
for any way to lock me up
for the rest of my life
hey its okay lee can
fix anything right
well see about that and
you dont have to convince me
ig i believe you
you dont think
im capable of murder
just put me in a room with
the guy who really killed her
littl early for you to start
drinking at this time of day
they put me on leave
at the station
apprently most commuters
dont like it when their
dj is a murder suspect
yeah so maybe you should
take your business elsewhere
no offense but you make
the other customers
uncomfortable
youre actually saying i make
these guys uncomfortable
come on iggy deserves
a drink as much as anybody
thank you
more than anybody
thanks glenna but you
dont need to stand up for me
and if you want to grab
a drink in a friendlier place
i get off at five
i appreciate the offer
but it seems like
im better off
drinking alone
thank you all for coming
tonight to pay tribute
to our dear girl merrin
i know that dale
would like to say
a few words
to welcome you
well uh
its uh
its real good
to see you all here
the truth is i havent
felt much like
getting out of bed
in the morning since merrin
ig perrish murdered her and
hes still walking the streets
i treated him like a son
practically all his life
and then he killed
my little
my little girl
as long as hes free
theres no way that her soul
can be laid to rest
so let us all
bow our heads
in prayer
thank you for coming
jesus christ ig
leave me alone
glenna

coming out here
they couldve seen you
she went to church
every fucking sunday
she wore a cross
around her neck

and let her die out here
alone and afraid

i do to stop this how
can i make them go away
you killed that
innocent girl
merrin theres nothing i can

i didnt kill her father
and now people are telling
me all these things
i dont want to hear
theres no prayers you can say
ill try anything
you did this to yourself
what
youve turned away from god
youve cast yourself
into the darkness
i didnt do anything wrong
every devil
used to be an angel youve
fallen from grace forever
when satan was banished from
heaven he was cursed to crawl
the earth
like a snake
theres no hope
for you
what so thats it
theres no way you can help me
ive got a rope
in that shed
over there
i can take you out
to that tree where merrin died
and i
i can string you up
unless youd
like to do
the decent thing
and hang yourself
what do you say
lee
everyone in this town
is going fucking crazy
the towns always
been crazy
i think its because of me
and these goddam horns
yeah
the what
the horns
these horns
what are you
talking about
wait cant
you see them
are you high
right now
have you been hanging
out with terry
so maybe
maybe the horns just
dont work on good people
youve been under an inhuman
amount of stress recently
and maybe youre just starting
to go a little you know
and if im this crazy
and i can
imagine all this
then i could easily have got
so drunk that i blacked out
that night
and killed merrin
and just forgot
all about it right
mom
mom
i didnt know
you were coming
i didnt know
where else to go mom
something really bad
is happening to me
oh sweetie
why couldnt you go
somewhere else
what
what do you mean
i dont want to hear
about all your problems
i dont want to know
mom
sometimes when you talk
i just want to sing
la la la la la
what are you
doing mom
i want to hold my breath
until you go away
jesus christ
mom dont
dont
stop it
im going to write
you a letter
a really
nice letter
about how much
dad and i love you
and how great it
would be for both of us
if you would
just go
but where
where can i go
i dont know didnt
you always want to go hiking
in alaska didnt you
want to go to vietnam
to teach english
those were things merrin
and i were going yo do
together you know that
i dont care where you go as
long as i dont have to see you
because every time i see you
it just makes me so
unhappy
i just want to be happy
again sweetheart
i understand
and i dont want you
to be my son anymore
oh
are you going
to go away
ig
i thought i
heard you coming
yeah ok
let me walk you
through this dad this
is the part where you
tell me something awful
youve been keeping
to yourself just say it
and well get it
out of the way
i dont know why you
turned out like this
with your brother
its easier
we can always
play music together
but with you i never
know what to say to you
well
thats not bad
all things considered
i think
about merrin
what a beautiful
girl she was
i loved her
you know
in a way
i envied you
i was never in
love with anyone
the way you two were
in love with each other
you couldnt hear
her laugh without smiling
it was like music
and when i think about
what you did to her
and you never thought
maybe just maybe
that i didnt do it
of course not
youre trying to
get away with murder
and the worst part is
im helping you do it
what what do
you mean by that
i went to call
to the guy who runs
the states forensics lab
are you telling me
you got your friend to
set that fire to the lab
when the world comes
for my son with the knives out
its my job to
stand in the way
dad the evidence you got
burnt up couldve saved me
how could
you do it
she was one of the
best people i ever knew
she was my favorite
thing about you
yeah me too
so if you knew
how much i loved her
then how could you ever
believe id kill her
isnt that
why you killed her
because you loved
her so much
and you lost her
way more people kill out
of love than out of hate
whats going on ig did you
go home like i asked you to
yeah and it was
very enlightening
did you know that my dad
got his friend to start
the fire in the lab
hypothetically
if i did know
i would legally be required
to tell the police
but maybe that fire
was a blessing in disguise
how how was it
a fucking blessing
if the lab hadnt burned down
that evidence wouldve
cleared me lee
ok i know its rough for you
staying at your house
so why dont you just
take the keys to my place
you can crash on the couch
no im fine ive actually
got a lot to do
ive got to figure out
who really killed merrin
and get him to confess
how are you planning to do
lately i can be
pretty fucking persuasive
hey ig nice look
for you showing
your true nature
you know guys id really
appreciate it if youd fuck off
ig admit you killed her itd
be such a huge scoop for me
good to know
your journalistic integrity
is unimpeachable
you confess to me
i could get out of
stupid local news
i got an idea
how about you guys beat the shit
out of each other
and the winner gets
an exclusive interview with me
ha ha
ha ha
i thought i told you
i dont want you coming
around here no more
ig
oh al you dont want to do
that youll get arrested
i dont give a flying
fuck if i get arrested
why dont you get me a whisky
you only want the money
what i really want is
to burn this place down
and collect the insurance
can you not burn down the bar
right now i need
your help for something
if anyone knows anything
about who killed merrin
youre gonna have
to tell me now
only thing i ever killed
was a couple of dogs
i run a dogfighting ring out of
the supply room back there
jesus
al i dont want to know that
ive been unemployed
for three months
and i hate my life
so i can
sure understand
wanting to kill someone
rob thats not what i meant
i really want to show
everybody my dick
oh dont
i want that all the time
i want that all the time
the only thing i know
i got a cousin
whos a cop
and he knows
who the new witness is
this waitress who served you
the night merrin got killed
says she saw you
drive back to the restaurant
and drag merrin
into your car
thanks a lot stan

wouldve told youre the only
one who loved her like i did

i loved her
but now i dont know if i ever
really even knew who she was
you think theres a chance
in hell im gonna say
one word to you
about my daughter

forgiveness or compassion
or understanding go talk
to a goddamn priest

for you to even try
and look pretty again
you guys really want to stop
following me around
youre telling us
what to do now
oh
i mean wouldnt
you rather
just suck each other
off right here
what the hell
makes you say that
you know ever since we were
kids i kind of assumed
you maybe had to act
so tough because you were
ashamed of yourself
was i right
when i was a kid i used to
shoplift gay porno magazines
from the drug store when my dad
found them under my bed
he cracked me with his belt
youve both been brought up
to believe its a sin
but its just being human
thats why i always wanted
to be partnered with eric
i think about him all the time
when im whacking off
i want to kiss you on the
mouth when you talk
dirty like that
have fun
officers
oh wallace

my head clear tonight

have you been doing lately
if you want to know

ive had a hard time
staying sober
you know ever
since merrin died
ive actually been
on kind of a bender myself
tonight
ive been having
a very good time
thats uh
thats great im glad
to hear that ig
shit look

tough for you lately

but heres where
the fun ends
this is gonna give me
no pleasure at all
what are you
talking about
well
youre my big brother
terry
ive always depended on you
to look out for me
ive always tried to do my
best by you ig you know that
except when you saw merrin
lying under that tree
in that dirt you didnt
call an ambulance
and you didnt
call the cops
you just ran off
and left her there
fuck ig she was
already dead ok
there was nothing i could do
the cops wouldve thought
that i killed her
even when i got arrested you
didnt go to them and tell them
the truth no
now why would you
why would you do that
unless you were guilty
unless you actually
killed her
because im your fucking
brother thats why
you understand if i i mean
they wouldve just thought
i was helping you
but you didnt even
try to help me
all you wanted
to do was save
your own skin you are
a selfish motherfucker
terry and i hate you
you know what
youre so
fucking right
youre right im evil
and you should kill me iggy
thats what you should do
you should fucking kill me
thats what i deserve
right i mean after what i did
thats what i fucking deserve
the way i see it i have
every right to kill you
but im gonna let you live
and make you suffer
why dont you just finish
all that off
what all of it
i think i made
myself clear

nowhere left to run
youre going to see
everything she saw

youre going to live
through all of it
ig iggy

hardest thing ive ever done

to face his demon
was the only way
i could help him
jesus christ ig
ive been looking
for you everywhere
get out of here before
i do something were
both going to regret
youve got to take care
of yourself thats what
merrin wouldve wanted
so youre the expert
on what merrin wanted now
i was never going
to tell you anything
no
so how long was it going
on between you two
you dont want to
know any of that
i need to understand
just a couple months
shes moving out
to california
we wanted to figure out if
it was real before we told you
so when she got killed
did you think it was me
like did you think that i found
out about you and lost control
if i thought that
i wouldnt help you
i dont want your help
im gonna prove that waitress
was lying and im gonna get
terry to confess to the police

to be able to help it
i never meant
to kill her
i didnt mean
to do it
i loved her
just as much as you
im the one
who fixed her cross
she shouldve
been with me

trying to be good
trying to control myself

reason im alive

ok
mr perrish committed suicide
earlier today
weve recovered his vehicle
perrishs lawyer lee tourneau
was the only witness
of the scene
mr perrish confessed
his crimes to mr tourneau
and then killed himself
weve got a report from the
police that no body was found
all reports originating
outside the police department
should be considered
pure conjecture at this time
nothing more
one more question
breaking news this evening
from the police force
in merrin williams case
it occured tonight
that ig perrish has
well one thing
ill say in my favor
im really fucking
hard to kill
why the hell
arent you dead
the truth is i dont know the
answer to that question myself
i have prayed for
so long for you to die
but when i saw
the news on the tv
it didnt help one bit
i didnt kill her
mr williams
but you know
who did it
dont you
you got
to tell me
what will you
do if i tell you
you know what ill do
but this is my job
people say you should always
do the right thing
but sometimes
there is no right thing
and then
then you just have to pick
the sin you can live with
why dont
you come inside
yesterday i was wondering
around the house
and i found this
i thought maybe i should
give it to the police but
that didnt feel right
she wanted you to have this
thank you
theres something
i would like
to give you
here
merrins mother gave this
to her just before she
you know son
i think
i think you need this
even more than i do
i think you need her
to keep you safe
well now
i guess
maybe thats some kind
of blessing after all
the horns werent a curse
but a blessing
they guided me this far
and when i put on her cross
i could feel her
protecting me again
dear ig
youll never read this
while im alive
im not even sure i want
you to read it after im dead
i think youre gonna
ask me to marry you soon
and you dont know
how much i want to say yes
but i cant
the thing is ig
im very sick
the sort of cancer i have its
the kind that runs in families
i saw my mother go through it
and i saw what
it did to my father
if i tell you im sick youll
want to marry me even more
and ill be weak and say yes
and youll give up your future
and be shackled to me
as i go through hell
and die anyway
i wont put you through that
i love you too much
i promise to hurt
you just enough
to push you away
and hopefully one day
you can forgert me
and then move on
to someone else
youll have children
grandchildren
and greatgrandchildren
youll go for long walks
in the woods
on one of these walks
when youre very old
youll find yourself
at a tree
a house in its branches
ill be waiting
for you there
ill be waiting by candlelight
in our tree house
shining the light
of my cross into your eyes
the first message
i ever sent you
us
i love you iggy perrish
your girl merrin
ig
youre alive
no dont
ig
we have to clear
your name
we need to figure out
who really killed merrin
it was lee
if you are going
after lee
then i am coming
with you
youre not strong
enough for that
im not
leaving you
i made myself
a promise
ever again
if anything happens to me
i need to know youre all right
for mom and dads sake
ill be damned
you and me both
what are you
doing out here

to go a lot easier
for both of us
if you dont lie to me
ig
im your best friend youve
told me your whole life
you think i have something
to do with this
believe me
all i want to do
is kill you
but im trying
to be human
im trying to be the kind
of man merrin wanted me to be
so im giving you
this chance to do
the right thing

turn yourself in
