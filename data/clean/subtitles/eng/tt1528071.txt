that mattered was her 
she was my garden of eden 
and god knows how beawutiful
 it was until that night 
no  no one is born evil 
the devil himself
 was a fallen angel 
but sometines 
 when you go through hell 
the only way out is to walk
 deeper into the fire

  though nothing  
  nothing will
keep us together  
  we can beat them  
  forever and ever  
  oh we can be heroes  
hey  ig  what does it feel
like to get away with murder 
want to comment on the fire
at the lab in tacoma last night 
have you heard that the
police have a new witness 
ask god to save your soul
for what you did to her 
i should ask the devil
to punish whoever
the fuck killed her 
  hi  this is lee 
please leave a message 
hi  lee  please 
can you meet me
at my parents  house
in half an hour 
i really need to talk to you 
pick up the phone  man  come on 
are you proud of me  mom 
i m so famous 
people follow me
everywhere i go 
 come inside  sweetie 
you just can t talk
to those reporters 
they ll take whatever you say
and just twist it around 
but if i don t talk
to them  it looks like i
have something to hide  right 
how s lee
working out for you 
you still think
he s up to the job 
yes  he s keeping
me out of jail 
at least for the time being 
which is some kind of triumph 
i know he s
an old friend of yours 
but you don t have to settle
for a public defender 
i ve got the money  i will hire
you the best lawyer in seattle 
every other lawyer we talked
to wanted me to take a plea 
lee is the only one
who believes i m innocent 
just don t talk to
any more reporters  please 
and don t admit
anything 
i don t have anything
to admit to  dad 
we don t care what happened 
you re our son 
that s all
that matters 
  sit back down  ig 
  if you think for a second
that i might ve killed her 
then why are you protecting me 
because if i did anything
to her  i m a fucking monster 
 i got to go 
 ig  look  i   
i don t have to go
back on the road
ext week if you
don t want me to 
you got to earn a living 
i ll sort things out 
except i need you
to stay  terry 
the whole family needs
to put up a united front for ig 
hey  buddy 
how is it going 
  lee 
 lee 
if you want any food 
we ve got plenty of leftovers
from lunch 
  i grabbed something
on the way  thank yhou 
how are you guys doing 
  yeah  hum 
lee  what happened
at the lab in tacoma 
one of the reporters this
morning told me it burned down 
the samples from merrin s
body were destroyed 
all of the murderer s
blood and dna  
that s a fucking
disaster for us  right 
that means there s no evidence
anybody else killed her 
it s not ideal  but there s
no need to panic at this point 
and who is this new witness 
what is that 
i m trying to figure
that out today and i m also
gonna get your confession
to the police thrown out 
yeah  good  you know
i never confessed to them 
they re just looking
for any way to lock me up
for the rest of my life 
hey  it s okay  lee can
fix anything  right 
we ll see about that  and
you don t have to convince me 
ig  i believe you 
you don t think
i m capable of murder 
just put me in a room with
the guy who really killed her 
littl early for you to start
drinking at this time of day 
they put me on leave
at the station 
apprently  most commuters
don t like it when their
dj is a murder suspect 
yeah  so maybe you should
take your business elsewhere 
no offense  but you make
the other customers
uncomfortable 
you re actually saying i make
these guys uncomfortable 
come on  iggy deserves
a drink as much as anybody 
 thank you 
 more than anybody 
thanks  glenna  but you
don t need to stand up for me 
and if you want to grab
a drink in a friendlier place 
i get off at five 
  i appreciate the offer 
but it seems like
i m better off   
drinking alone 
thank you all for coming
tonight to pay tribute
to our dear girl merrin 
i know that dale
would like to say
a few words
to welcome you 
 well  uh   
it s  uh   
it s real good
to see you all here 
the truth is i haven t
felt much like   
getting out of bed
in the morning since merrin   
ig perrish murdered her and
he s still walking the streets 
i treated him like a son
practically all his life 
and then he killed
my little   
   my little girl 
as long as he s free 
there s no way that her soul
can be laid to rest 
so let us all
bow our heads
in prayer 
thank you for coming 
  jesus christ  ig 
  leave me alone 
glenna 
  what are you thinking 
coming out here 
they could ve seen you 
she went to church
every fucking sunday 
she wore a cross
around her neck 
and did it make
any difference 
no 
god turned a blind eye
and let her die out here
alone and afraid 
  all right 
  fuck god 
for whatever reason
in this crazy fucked up world 
i was being punished 
when they lookef at me 
they saw a devil 
and maybe i did too 
and now i had to look
like one

her here and drive away 
divorce my husband

this girl on the side 
she works at the bradlees
down by the marina

patients

lee s the one
who fixed your cross 
he wanted to give it back
to you  but i traded him
the cherry bomb instead 
so it s all my fault 
 how is it your fault 
if he gave it back to you 
then he would ve been
the one who  
you think you traded me
for the cherry bomb 
you think that s
how things work 
i left it there
for you 
it wasn t
an accident 
i   
i wanted you to find it
and give it back to me 
i wanted you to be
the one who   
 who what 
   i  i wish you could swim  
  like the dolphins  
  like dolphins can swim  
  though nothing  
  nothing will
keep us together  
  we can beat them  
  forever and ever  
  oh  we can be heroes  
  just for one day  
  oh  
  i will be king  
  and you  
  you will be queen  
 what   
what the hell
is going on here 
hey 
  i was going to operate 
but i sort of
got distracted 
we asked you if we
could have sex instead
and you said it was okay 
  how could i possibly say
it was okay 
i was under anesthesia 
  you sort of nodded your head 
so we assumed
you thought it was okay 
 father mould 
  get away from me 
leave me alone 
  i m not here
to hurt you  please 
tell me what can
i do to stop this  how
can i make them go away 
you killed that
innocent girl 
merrin  there s nothing i can
do  so please  leave me alone 
  i didn t kill her  father 
and now people are telling
me all these things
i don t want to hear 
there s no prayers you can say 
i ll try anything 
  you did this to yourself 
  what 
  you ve turned away from god 
you ve cast yourself
into the darkness 
  i didn t do anything wrong 
  every devil
used to be an angel  you ve
fallen from grace forever 
when satan was banished from
heaven  he was cursed to crawl
the earth
like a snake 
there s no hope
for you 
 what  so that s it 
there s no way you can help me 
  i ve got a rope
in that shed
over there 
i can take you out
to that tree where merrin died
and i   
i can string you up 
unless you d
like to do
the decent thing
and hang yourself 
what do you say 
 lee 
everyone in this town
is going fucking crazy 
the town s always
been crazy 
i think it s because of me
and these goddam horns 
 yeah 
the what 
 the horns 
these horns 
what are you
talking about 
wait  can t
you see them 
are you high
right now 
have you been hanging
out with terry 
 so maybe   
maybe the horns just
don t work on good people 
you ve been under an inhuman
amount of stress recently 
and maybe you re just starting
to go a little  you know   
 and if i m this crazy
and i can
imagine all this 
then i could easily have got
so drunk that i blacked out
that night 
and killed merrin 
and just forgot
all about it  right 
mom 
mom 
i didn t know
you were coming 
i didn t know
where else to go  mom 
something really bad
is happening to me 
 oh  sweetie 
why couldn t you go
somewhere else 
 what 
what do you mean 
i don t want to hear
about all your problems 
i don t want to know 
  mom 
sometimes  when you talk 
i just want to sing 
  la la la la la  
what are you
doing  mom 
i want to hold my breath
until you go away 
jesus christ 
mom  don t   
don t   
stop it 
i m going to write
you a letter   
a really
nice letter
about how much
dad and i love you 
and how great it
would be for both of us
if you would
just go 
but where 
where can i go 
i don t know  didn t
you always want to go hiking
in alaska  didn t you
want to go to vietnam
to teach english 
those were things merrin
and i were going yo do
together  you know that 
i don t care where you go  as
long as i don t have to see you 
because every time i see you 
it just makes me so   
unhappy 
i just want to be happy
again  sweetheart 
 i understand 
and i don t want you
to be my son anymore 
 oh 
are you going
to go away 
 ig 
i thought i
heard you coming 
yeah  ok 
let me walk you
through this  dad  this
is the part where you
tell me something awful
you ve been keeping
to yourself  just say it
and we ll get it
out of the way 
i don t know why you
turned out like this 
with your brother 
it s easier 
we can always
play music together 
but with you  i never
know what to say to you 
well 
that s not bad 
all things considered 
i think
about merrin
what a beautiful
girl she was 
i loved her 
you know 
in a way 
i envied you 
i was never in
love with anyone
the way you two were
in love with each other 
you couldn t hear
her laugh without smiling 
it was like music 
and when i think about
what you did to her   
 and you never thought 
maybe  just maybe 
that i didn t do it 
 of course not 
you re trying to
get away with murder 
and the worst part is 
i m helping you do it 
what  what do
you mean by that 
i went to call
to the guy who runs
the state s forensics lab 
are you telling me
you got your friend to
set that fire to the lab 
when the world comes
for my son with the knives out 
it s my job to
stand in the way 
dad  the evidence you got
burnt up could ve saved me 
how could
you do it 
she was one of the
best people i ever knew 
she was my favorite
thing about you 
 yeah  me too 
so if you knew
how much i loved her 
then how could you ever
believe i d kill her 
isn t that
why you killed her 
because you loved
her so much
and you lost her 
way more people kill out
of love than out of hate 
  what s going on  ig  did you
 go home like i asked you to 
yeah  and it was
very enlightening 
did you know that my dad
got his friend to start
the fire in the lab 
  hypothetically 
if i did know 
i would legally be required
 to tell the police 
but maybe that fire
 was a blessing in disguise 
how  how was it
a fucking blessing 
if the lab hadn t burned down 
that evidence would ve
cleared me  lee 
ok  i know it s rough for you
staying at your house 
so why don t you just
 take the keys to my place 
 you can crash on the couch 
no  i m fine  i ve actually
got a lot to do 
i ve got to figure out
who really killed merrin
and get him to confess 
  how are you planning to do 
lately  i can be
pretty fucking persuasive 
hey  ig  nice look
for you  showing
your true nature 
  you know  guys  i d really
appreciate it if you d fuck off 
  ig  admit you killed her  it d
be such a huge scoop for me  
  good to know
your journalistic integrity
is unimpeachable 
  you confess to me 
i could get out of
stupid local news 
  i got an idea 
how about you guys beat the shit
out of each other 
and the winner gets
an exclusive interview with me 
ha  ha 
ha  ha 
i thought i told you
i don t want you coming
around here no more 
ig 
oh  al  you don t want to do
that  you ll get arrested 
i don t give a flying
fuck if i get arrested 
why don t you get me a whisky 
you only want the money 
what i really want is
to burn this place down
and collect the insurance 
  can you not burn down the bar
right now  i need
your help for something 
if anyone knows anything
about who killed merrin 
you re gonna have
to tell me now 
only thing i ever killed
was a couple of dogs 
i run a dogfighting ring out of
the supply room back there 
  jesus 
al  i don t want to know that 
  i ve been unemployed
for three months
and i hate my life 
so i can
sure understand
wanting to kill someone 
  rob  that s not what i meant 
i really want to show
everybody my dick 
 oh  don t  
 i want that all the time 
i want that all the time 
  the only thing i know 
i got a cousin
who s a cop
and he knows
who the new witness is 
this waitress who served you
the night merrin got killed
says she saw you
drive back to the restaurant
and drag merrin
into your car

hurt her

you ve already
have done it 
i know that 
these days  i bring out
the worst in people 
what i want is for you
to tell me the truth
about what you did
to my daughter 
and then i want to kill you 
  what i need to know is 
did merrin say anything
to you about leaving me 
or about being
with somebody else 
you got some
kind of nerve 
coming out here and
asking me if my daughter
was unfaithful
to you 
are you out of
your goddamn mind 
you re the only person she
would ve told  you re the only
one who loved her like i did 
don t you fucking
dare say we re the same 
when i was watching the cancer
devour my wife s insides 
the only saving grace was i
thought that was the worst thing
that d ever happen to me 
but boy  was i wrong 
  dale  believe me 
you have to believe me 
i loved her 
but now i don t know if i ever
really even knew who she was 
you think there s a chance
in hell i m gonna say
one word to you
about my daughter 
if you re looking for
forgiveness or compassion 
or understanding  go talk
to a goddamn priest 
i know you
killed her 
and i hope you die 
i hope you die
scared and helpless
in the dirt 
just like
my merrin did 
i m sorry 
i m sorry 
i souldn t
have come 
get off my porch or
i swear i will shoot you 
  fuck this 
fuck 
sometimes god works
 in mysterious ways 
the horns that reveal
 so much already 
now i can use them to findnher killer and set things right 
see  that even doesn t pay
and it s gonna be a long time
for you to even try
and look pretty again 
you guys really want to stop
following me around 
you re telling us
what to do now 
 oh 
i mean  wouldn t
you rather
just suck each other
off right here 
what the hell
makes you say that 
you know  ever since we were
kids  i kind of assumed
you maybe had to act
so tough because you were
ashamed of yourself 
was i right 
when i was a kid  i used to
shoplift gay porno magazines
from the drug store  when my dad
found them under my bed 
he cracked me with his belt 
  you ve both been brought up
to believe it s a sin 
but it s just being human 
that s why i always wanted
to be partnered with eric 
i think about him all the time
when i m whacking off 
i want to kiss you on the
mouth when you talk
dirty like that 
have fun 
officers 
  oh  wallace 
  come here 
 hey  terry 
 ig 
i didn t know you were
gonna come by 
  how s it going 
 what s that snake
doing around your neck 
  i made a new friend 
 you want a drink 
or maybe something
a little stronger 
 no 
no  i want to keep
my head clear tonight 
but don t let me stop you 
do as much as you want to do 
jesus christ 
terry  how many drugs
have you been doing lately 
if you want to know
the truth  i ve   
i ve had a hard time
staying sober 
you know  ever
since merrin died 
i ve actually been
on kind of a bender myself
tonight 
i ve been having
a very good time 
 that s  uh   
that s great  i m glad
to hear that  ig 
shit  look   
i know things have been
tough for you lately 
ok  but   
well  understandably 
but i just   
but here s where
the fun ends 
this is gonna give me
no pleasure at all 
what are you
talking about 
 well   
you re my big brother 
terry 
i ve always depended on you
to look out for me 
i ve always tried to do my
best by you  ig  you know that 
 except when you saw merrin
lying under that tree
in that dirt  you didn t
call an ambulance
and you didn t
call the cops 
you just ran off
and left her there 
fuck  ig  she was
already dead  ok 
there was nothing i could do 
the cops would ve thought
that i killed her 
even when i got arrested  you
didn t go to them and tell them
the truth  no 
now  why would you 
why would you do that
unless you were guilty 
unless you actually
killed her 
because i m your fucking
brother  that s why 
you understand  if i    i mean 
they would ve just thought
i was helping you 
  but you didn t even
try to help me 
all you wanted
to do was save
your own skin  you are
a selfish motherfucker 
terry  and i hate you 
 you know what 
you re so
fucking right 
you re right  i m evil
and you should kill me  iggy 
that s what you should do 
you should fucking kill me 
that s what i deserve 
right  i mean  after what i did 
that s what i fucking deserve 
the way i see it  i have
every right to kill you 
but i m gonna let you live
and make you suffer 
why don t you just finish
all that off 
 what  all of it 
i think i made
myself clear 
now there s
nowhere left to run 
you re going to see
everything she saw
and feel what she felt 
and the worst part is 
you re going to live
through all of it 
 ig    iggy 
fuck  iggy 
iggy 
 terry 
 no  no 
 terry  terry  terry 
no  iggy 
where are you 
no  help me 
stop   
stop 
  punishing terry was the
 hardest thing i ve ever done 
but forcing him
 to face his demon
was the only way
 i could help him 
 jesus christ  ig 
i ve been looking
for you everywhere 
get out of here before
i do something we re
both going to regret 
you ve got to take care
of yourself  that s what
merrin would ve wanted 
so you re the expert
on what merrin wanted now 
i was never going
to tell you anything 
 no 
so how long was it going
on between you two 
  you don t want to
know any of that 
  i need to understand 
 just a couple months 
she s moving out
to california 
we wanted to figure out if
it was real before we told you 
so when she got killed 
did you think it was me 
like did you think that i found
out about you and lost control 
  if i thought that 
i wouldn t help you 
  i don t want your help 
i m gonna prove that waitress
was lying and i m gonna get
terry to confess to the police 
fucking go  lee

 damn right they re horns 
i m glad you can
finally see them 
now you ve got
to tell me the truth 
merrin s cross can t
protect you any more 
why should i
tell you anything 
because you re not going
to be able to help it 
i never meant
to kill her 
i didn t mean
to do it 
i loved her
just as much as you 
i m the one
who fixed her cross 
she should ve
been with me 
you sure as shit fooled me 
i always thought
you spent your whole life
trying to be good 
  trying to control myself 
  but you saved my life
when we were kids 
you pulled me out of the water
right here  you re the only
reason i m alive 
this is the stupidest
mistake i ever made 
i sould ve let you drown

  no 
you know what 
love made devils of us both 
the way i see it 
you confessed to me 
and were so overwhelmed
with guilt
that you killed yourself 
so    i ve always
wanted to try this 
it s gonna be fun 
it s gonna be fun 
ok 
 mr  perrish committed suicide
earlier today 
we ve recovered his vehicle 
 perrish s lawyer lee tourneau
was the only witness
of the scene 
mr  perrish confessed
 his crimes to mr tourneau
and then killed himself 
  we ve got a report from the
police that no body was found 
  all reports originating
 outside the police department
should be considered
 pure conjecture at this time 
nothing more 
   one more question 
  breaking news this evening
from the police force
 in merrin william s case 
it occured tonight
that ig perrish has   
well  one thing
i ll say in my favor 
i m really fucking
hard to kill 
why the hell
aren t you dead 
the truth is i don t know the
answer to that question myself 
i have prayed for
so long for you to die 
but when i saw
the news on the tv 
it didn t help one bit 
 i didn t kill her 
mr williams 
but you know
who did it 
don t you 
you got
to tell me 
  what will you
do if i tell you 
  you know what i ll do 
 but this is my job 
people say you should always
do the right thing 
but sometimes
there is no right thing 
and then 
then you just have to pick
the sin you can live with 
why don t
you come inside 
yesterday  i was wondering
around the house
and i found this 
i thought maybe i should
give it to the police  but   
that didn t feel right 
she wanted you to have this 
 thank you 
there s something
i would like
to give you 
here 
merrin s mother gave this
to her just before she   
you know  son 
i think   
i think you need this
even more than i do 
i think you need her
to keep you safe 
well now 
i guess
maybe that s some kind
of blessing after all 
  the horns weren t a curse 
 but a blessing 
they guided me this far 
and when i put on her cross 
i could feel her
 protecting me again 
 dear ig 
 you ll never read this
while i m alive 
 i m not even sure i want
you to read it after i m dead 
 i think you re gonna
ask me to marry you soon
 and you don t know
how much i want to say yes 
 but i can t 
 the thing is  ig 
i m very sick 
 the sort of cancer i have  it s
the kind that runs in families 
 i saw my mother go through it 
 and i saw what
it did to my father 
 if i tell you i m sick  you ll
want to marry me even more 
 and i ll be weak and say yes 
 and you ll give up your future
 and be shackled to me
as i go through hell
 and die anyway 
 i won t put you through that 
 i love you too much 
 i promise to hurt
you just enough
 to push you away 
 and hopefully  one day 
you can forgert me
 and then move on
to someone else 
 you ll have children 
grandchildren
 and great grandchildren 
 you ll go for long walks
in the woods 
 on one of these walks 
 when you re very old 
 you ll find yourself
at a tree 
 a house in its branches 
 i ll be waiting
for you there 
 i ll be waiting by candlelight
in our tree house 
 shining the light
of my cross into your eyes 
 the first message
i ever sent you 
 us 
 i love you  iggy perrish 
your girl  merrin  
 ig 
you re alive 
  no  don t 
 ig 
we have to clear
your name 
we need to figure out
who really killed merrin 
 it was lee 
if you are going
after lee 
then i am coming
with you 
you re not strong
enough for that 
i m not
leaving you 
i made myself
a promise 
ever again 
if anything happens to me 
i need to know you re all right 
for mom and dad s sake 
 i ll be damned 
 you and me both 
what are you
doing out here 
you don t remember
anything that happened
between us  do you 
you want to
come inside 
no  actually i was hoping
we could go for a walk 
nobody s
looking for me 
pretty much verybody in town
everybody thinks i m dead 
  no shit 
  what do you say 
  just a walk 
  yeah 
why do you

trying to save his own ass
