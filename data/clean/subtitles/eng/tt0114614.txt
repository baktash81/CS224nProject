rebecca  don t forget guard duty 
adam was dust until god
injected him with life 
and do you know
what was in that injection 
water 
water is life  water is power 
well done  you ve all
done a masterful job 
95 per cent of the desert
and all the water it contains
now belongs to water and power 
i think that deserves a little toast 
to captain derouche 
for securing most of the desert 
  captain derouche 
  captain derouche 
i can promise you  sir  the rippers
will only be a minor setback 
once i take care of them 
that final crack of land will be ours 
this crack of land  captain 
well  it s just a small crack 
it doesn t matter  we ll let that go 
oh  my  now look what s happened 
we lost the feta plains 
and the tenelson ridge 
and so on 
there are three million litres of water
underneath the blue dunes 
and you will retrieve it 
do i make myself clear  gentlemen 
yes  sir 
good 
remove your boots  captain 
now come here 
the fool 
it was foolish not to carry out my order 
it was foolish to walk across
a floor full of glass

don t you  captain 
come closer 
walk 
sergeant small

  yes  sir 
lovely 
i take guard duty very seriously 
  before i was even born
  it s such a gamble when you get a face
  it s fascinating
to observe what the mirror does
  but when i dine 
it s for the wall that i set a place
  i belong to the blank generation
  and i can take it or leave it each time
elvis  elvis  come out and play

with the doodlin  cocks
  some argentines without means do it
  i hear in boston beans do it
  let s do it  let s fall in love
  when the little bluebird
  who has never said a word
  when the little bird fell
  at the bottom of a dell
  when the little blue clerk
  in the middle of his work
  starts a tune
  when a gentleman calls
  bugs in your rugs  they do it 
what s the use of my balls 
  the chimpanzees in the zoos do it
  some courageous kangaroos do it
  let s do it  let s fall in love
  i m sure sometimes on the sly you do it
  maybe even you and i might do it
  let s do it  let s fall in love
  it s goin  down  yo  the girl got a gun
  best run because she s quick
to flip and empty out the clip
  and make a man understand
where she s comin  from
  her hard core s connected
to the base of her fate
  she just breaks
and brings drama to the situation
  ejaculation  a hot projectile
  better recognise that she comes 
she comes correct  collect respect
  and if not  you catch a broken neck
  buddy  look down 
your shirt s all bloody
  looks like she caught you with
the bad one for messin  with the mad one

of the frontier who s size five and sexy

  she says she s had enough of men
and now she s lookin  for payback
  and there s no way
that you can fade her sun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  the most venomous
feminist homie  she ain t soft
  you give her trouble
and she might cut your head off
  or somethin  that you like
to think s the best
  she ll blow big holes in your chest
  she says she gotta cos
she says a lot of ladies won t
  she says she gotta cos
she says a lot of ladies don t
  she says she gotta cos
she says a lot of ladies can t
  she says she gotta cos she knows
a lot of ladies romance the thought
  to giving men their own medicine
  electrocute  em 
light  em up like con edison
  she got no fear  five rings in her ear
  holes in her nose  way out clothes
  livin  life to the full
is buckshot and bullets
  triggers  she ll pull it 
earth  she wanna rule it
  maybe she will cos she s quick to kill
  the city lights make her dresses tight 
yes  she bites
  you never know where she ll come from
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  there s no way
that you can fade her sun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
  she
  she flies without no feathers
  a fool to try and catch her
  well  i don t know

  i m bored with anticipation
  this love song radio station
  i guess you ll sleep
  i ll count sheep
  and watch you dream
  so let s
  make a run and buy a rocket  copter
  i bought it from a crooked copper
  her breath  it smelled like beer
  warm beer  warm beer
  hey  hey
