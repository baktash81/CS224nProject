water
water is life water is power

sergeant small

before i was even born
its such a gamble when you get a face

its for the wall that i set a place
i belong to the blank generation
and i can take it or leave it each time

the chimpanzees in the zoos do it
some courageous kangaroos do it
lets do it lets fall in love
im sure sometimes on the sly you do it
maybe even you and i might do it
lets do it lets fall in love
its goin down yo the girl got a gun
best run because shes quick
to flip and empty out the clip
and make a man understand
where shes comin from
her hard cores connected
to the base of her fate
she just breaks
and brings drama to the situation
ejaculation a hot projectile
better recognise that she comes
she comes correct collect respect
and if not you catch a broken neck
buddy look down
your shirts all bloody
looks like she caught you with
the bad one for messin with the mad one
told you bout this girl before
you didnt listen to me as i talked
now youre stalked by the hunter
of the frontier whos size five and sexy
quickly catch a body
and another one next week
huh it doesnt matter
cos the girls they strap
she says shes had enough of men
and now shes lookin for payback
and theres no way
that you can fade her sun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
the most venomous
feminist homie she aint soft
you give her trouble
and she might cut your head off
or somethin that you like
to thinks the best
shell blow big holes in your chest
she says she gotta cos
she says a lot of ladies wont
she says she gotta cos
she says a lot of ladies dont
she says she gotta cos
she says a lot of ladies cant
she says she gotta cos she knows
a lot of ladies romance the thought
to giving men their own medicine
electrocute em
light em up like con edison
she got no fear five rings in her ear
holes in her nose wayout clothes
livin life to the full
is buckshot and bullets
triggers shell pull it
earth she wanna rule it
maybe she will cos shes quick to kill
the city lights make her dresses tight
yes she bites
you never know where shell come from
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
theres no way
that you can fade her sun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun
she walks softly
but she carries a big gun

she flies without no feathers
a fool to try and catch her
