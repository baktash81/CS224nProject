caught on one of the branches on the way down
can you walk
youll need stitches
hey
you didnt hide your parachutes very well
and you left a blood trail for half a kilometer
follow me
i live not far from here
dik come
ignác
ignác
hot soup come
come in
i take it you are heading for prague
how far is it
thirty kilometers
i have a special delivery permit for my truck
i could take you
thank you
you rest here tonight
i will take you in the morning
enjoy your soup
please sit
how much do the germans pay you
for turning in your fellow countrymen huh
drop the gun
i said drop the gun
drop it
drop the gun
gun
you get him
well take that truck
come on
they had made their choice jan
sometimes you have to pick a side
would you prefer it was us
should be the next left
pull over here
mirek come away from the window
anna get the door
yes
we are looking for oldrich novák
the novákovi no longer live here
who is it
just somebody looking for directions
i am sorry but thats all i know
please
can you help us
there is a veterinarian in the next row of shops up the street
i hear he is a good man
one that may help
thank you
he normally only barks at germans
mmmmmm germans and anyone giving him a rectal examination
thank you dr eduard
come along benés
look after him mrs lukešová
normally for a dog bite you would go to a hospital not a vet
did you know oldrich novák
yes
and what if we were to say that oldrich novák was our contact here in prague
then i would have to wonder
if you are illinformed czech patriots
or gestapo spies trying to infiltrate what remains of the resistance
i dont detect a german accent
the decoding papers in your bag they dont have a german font
and given that this wound
has more tree bark than dog bite
i would have to guess that you were parachuted back into czechoslovakia
with information that was somewhat out of date
youre a clever man
we were also told you were a good man
how long have you been away
its been a while
rewards are given to people who inform on antinazi activity
heydrich has all but crushed the resistance
he has executed thousands
i can put you in contact with the miller
maybe he can help you
you can stay here tonight
ill contact the miller in the morning
my friend here says that you are a clever man
i agree
dont do anything that would change our opinion
go easy on the foot
you will be dancing the tango within a week
whoa whoa whoa
this is břetislav
the miller
eduard told me you were looking for oldrich novák
yes
would you like to take a drive with me
dont move
please sit
you were looking for oldrich novák
who gave you this contact
london
and you tell us this because
you are not giving us much choice and this doesnt look like gestapo headquarters
you where are you from
your accent bohemia
no dolní vilémovice moravia
so you must know the railway station at vladislav
yes
whats so special about it
i presume you are talking about the large bed of colored roses
that when seen from above is in the shape of our national flag
is it still there
seems the germans have still not looked at it from above
i am vanek
ladislav vanek
this is uncle hajsky
we are the head of the jindra organization
czech resistance
i am jan kubiš
i am josef gabčík
from slovakia
you must not be surprised by our lack of trust
the gestapo have been very successful in infiltrating our network
oldrich novák
he was taken away several months ago
why wasnt london informed
we lost contact with the czech government in exile in london some months ago
we need replacement crystals for the transmitter
weve been waiting for them to send someone to reestablish contact
is that you
there were other men on the plane
they were dropped elsewhere
its possible they have orders
to reestablish contact with london but that
that is not our mission
what is your mission
operation anthropoid
anthropoid
what is anthropoid
we are here to assassinate
ss obergruppenfűhrer reinhard heydrich
are you completely mad
we have our orders comrade
but this is madness
we have our orders comrade
heydrich
why stop with heydrich
why not have a go at hitler as well
he is only 300 kilometers down the road in a small village called berlin
so we inform london that you are refusing to cooperate with our mission
how dare you question us
how dare you question us
you know what we have sacrificed for the cause here
what you have sacrificed
what has czechoslovakia sacrificed
you have no idea what weve sacrificed
sit down please
you kill heydrich and hitler will tear prague apart
i take it you have family in czechoslovakia
father mother
you kill heydrich then you can consider them and everyone that ever knew you dead
all czech patriots should be ready to die for their country
that includes my family
well im not
i want to carry on fighting
we dont have that many left that are willing to do that
we are whats left of the czech resistance
i suggest a lesser rank should be assassinated
perhaps a few of them
heydrich is the head of the secret police
only hitler and himmler are above him in the nazi hierarchy
exactly my point
you really think youll ever get close enough to assassinate heydrich
our orders have come direct from the czech government in london
so this is about the czech government in london trying to impress the allies
it was the allies that gave us to the germans in the first place
munich was a betrayal
but it is also now history
i think what the czech government in london is asking is this
is czechoslovakia
still ready and willing to resist nazi germany
josef gabčík
and jan kubiš
you are both most welcome here
and please call me auntie moravec
ata ata
ata is my son
he is studying to be a violinist
ata this is josef and this is jan
pleased to meet you both
so try not to go outside
but if you do never walk together
if youre stopped you will need an excuse for why youre not at work
well try to get you medical certificates as soon as possible
always use our code three knocks then a single knock
in the meantime
lay low and i will use ata to make contact
good luck
thank you
goodbye
come on through please
josef
there is a way off the roof
there is a fire escape to the left
to the right it continues to the building next door
its good enough
im sure you both would like a glass of becherovka
thank you
its okay
mrs moravec
hey
hey
there was so much people at the market
but i didnt find the bread that you like
come
who is it
its okay marie
this is josef and this is jan
they will be staying with us while they are looking for work
pleased to meet you
hello
hello
hello
josef and jan are not registered with the police
as being residents here so remember please keep it strictly to yourself
ill put the shopping in the kitchen
welcome
mrs kovárníkovás daughter
i pay her for helping out
dinner will be at 600
please sit
ata dinner is ready
and finally the fiddler is silent
he is a violinist alois a violinist
you two boys looking for work then
yes
we are always looking for men to clean the cinders out of the locomotives
thank you mr moravec
well keep that in mind
so what do you do when you arent helping out here
you dont have a boyfriend
no
hows life in occupied prague marie
i guess not being registered with the police as residents
has something to do with this question
i hate the germans
and tell me do you have a friend
as lovely as you that
that you can trust
why
it would be less conspicuous if jan and i were not seen out alone
young love flourishes under german occupation
that sort of thing
but youre not that young
knowing that you are trustworthy is one thing marie
but doing this could get you shot
perhaps you should think about it
my friend lenka
she sometimes carries messages for uncle hajsky
good
we are going to a new years eve dance tomorrow night
would you like to go
look at them
its like
its like some old ritual thats lost its joy
maybe theres hope in the pretense
hello
it looks like youve landed on your feet with lenka
this was a mistake
hello
lenka this is jan and josef
you know its not very polite
please sit down
you are the most beautiful women in the room
congratulations
but you fail to understand this is
this is not a night off for us
this is not some game
josef maybe youre overreacting a little
jan take a look around
we appreciate the effort but the point was not to attract attention
we needed you as plain as possible
do you understand
you know for most girls
a little lipstick is the only way to forget whats happening here
even if its just for a few hours
yes
your lipstick gets you noticed
and that gets us noticed
and us being noticed gets us all shot
this little scene needs an ending
slap my face
slap my face
im not a whore
i think that went well
nine eight seven
six five four three two one
a british sten mark ii machine gun
one hundred rounds
and model 73 antitank grenades with pencil fuses
thats everything we could retrieve from the drop canister
uncle says he has made some progress with the information you asked for
there is a meeting at café moravia on vodičkova street
tuesday 200
i just wanted to apologize about the other night
you were completely right to do what you did
marie didnt fully inform me about the situation
she is very young
she still has romantic ideas about the war
and you
war is not romantic
we cross here
after our last date i thought you might both show wearing potato sacks
i dont know what im doing
you are doing fine
take a seat here order a drink
we wont be long
josef
jan
opálka
valčík
i see you are no strangers to one another but we dont have much time
we all trained special operations together
valčík here was even on the same drop
yes dropped 10 minutes later and 30 miles off course
thanks to valčík and his group silver a
we have finally reestablished communications with london
i have orders to send and receive any communications between you and london
you have your own decoder book right
yes
second lieutenant opálka and warrant officer curda
have completed operation out distance so both are now available to assist you
second lieutenant opálka is the senior officer here
yes this is true but your mission objective supersedes my rank
we had word from london anthropoid
utmost priority
we assist with everything possible
so
this is your show bratři
so we know that heydrich returns to his family
every day at panenské břežany
but both his chateau and the castle are both heavily guarded
they are not feasible targets
but once a month
he also travels to berlin by train
and we can predict this
because his personal carriages are prepared several days in advance
but again the station and the train are both heavily guarded
what about derailing the train outside of prague
we can derail the train but that is no guarantee that heydrich is killed
i have made contact with an expupil of mine
who works as a repair man inside the castle
hes willing to help
but he only knows when heydrich arrives in the morning
and when he leaves
what good is that
you can build a picture
of his routine
sometimes he travels with an armed escort and sometimes he does not
perhaps there is a pattern in this
there is a safe house near the castle
the repairman could drop off the timetable every day before work
lenka or marie could collect it
good
and jan and i will follow the route from the chateau to the castle
gentlemen this operation
will involve almost everyone we have left in the resistance
so many have been captured by the gestapo
if you are arrested you will face some harsh facts
there will be no escape
youll be tortured until you reveal everything you know
and then you will be executed
you must protect your fellow comrades
by shutting down any links you have to them
operation out distance has resupplied us with these
carry the cyanide capsules at all times
we have to end our meeting
use the window
clear
looks like theres a whole garrison there
thats our man
five minutes after 900
hes riding solo today
wait
armed escort
thirty seconds behind
thirty seconds
thirty seconds 30 seconds
if we can use a rope or a steel cable to stop the mercedes
then 30 seconds
then 30 seconds would be all we need
even if a rope can stop the car
we still need more than 30 seconds to escape from here
and wed have to face the armed guard here in the open
it would not be my first choice
and if its our only choice
the point of the mission is to succeed yes
im more worried that we havent planned what to do if we are successful
what happens afterwards is not important
lets follow the route to the castle
well
arrived 915 left 515
with an armed escort
armed escort
theres only one person in prague that travels with an armed escort
are you going to assassinate heydrich
what
heydrich is the target
for your own safety its best that you dont ask too many questions
its a bit too late for that now
well you agreed to help the resistance
who the target is should not concern you
we are about to help you assassinate reinhard heydrich
of course it concerns us
okay
everyone just relax
maybe it was a mistake not to inform you of the danger
murder heydrich
no no
assassinate heydrich
murder implies he has a life worth living
so you think we are just two little girls
who are here to follow the important parachutists around
whoa lenka
weve been resisting here from the beginning in our own way
i personally dont have any reservation to killing a nazi pig
but dont treat us like what you are about to do doesnt affect us
it does and it will
and you should keep your weapon clean because its filthy
marie
where are all my pots and pans
this exit here is this
you see
its the slowest part of the route
anywhere else is impossible
so we do it here
agreed
yes
perhaps not perfect but its the best option
good
917 to 441
without
are you really going to go through with this
we have our orders
so you kill heydrich
what then
you think there arent more like him
they come and the killing continues even worse than it did before
when does it stop
i wish i had an answer for you
you think any of this makes sense to me
then walk away now
and go where marie
you think we can escape from what is happening here
pretend this madness is not real
some days im not even sure it is real
heydrich chokes the people of this city with a blanket of fear
people are shot for what
their race their religion
their cigarettes
you hear the stories about poland
marie its okay
just tell me we are doing the right thing
i think it is my turn to apologize to you about the other morning
you were right to be angry
we should have told you what was at risk
given you the choice to walk away
my father was a captain in the army
wanted sons got three daughters
he and many others were arrested in 39
when germany took control over czechoslovakia
and when heydrich took over here last september
his first order was to execute all the prisoners
my father was among 5000 shot in the first week by heydrich
for me theres no walking away
heydrich is worth the risk
we have checked the route
we think we know how to do it
i will arrange a meeting
at the cafe the day after tomorrow
300 pm
our original contact oldrich novák
who was his direct handler
ladislav vanek
he is the one whos most opposed to what we have to do
all im asking is what is he so afraid of
jan
sorry
so he approaches here
corner of kirchmayer and holeschowitzer street
here
yes his car will have to really slow down to take that corner
yes he slows to about 10 miles per hour
weve averaged out his morning arrival times
we can expect him at approximately 930 am
and the weapons
at that range the sten gun should hit everything within the car
and the armed escort
we have found no pattern
some days yes some days no
if there is an armed escort
we stand down and await the next day
you know i have been against this action from the start
yes thats been clear
i cannot give the goahead without asking london to reconsider
ladislav this is a military operation
its not your order to give
without the resistance this mission doesnt exist
do you want to put
i am with ladislav
we should get london to rethink our position here in prague
we have our orders curda
and nothing has changed
its easy for london to give orders
its our lives on the line
lets wait for reconfirmation
we waited four months
four months
london needs action
then a few more days wont make a difference
valčík how long before you can get to the transmitter
i can get to the transmitter the day after tomorrow
then a couple of days for london to transmit back the answer
happy birthday
happy birthday
happy birthday
happy birthday ata
thank you
cheers
cheers
cheers
cheers
its beautiful
thank you
uh
ata i know this is your party
but we have a little announcement to make
i have asked marie to marry me and she has said yes
congratulations
congratulations
thank you
thank you
congratulations
thank you
why are we here
hmm
i know
i know
whos to say it wont happen
london calls it off
youre lying to yourself my friend
because it is easier
i have to believe there is a way through this
that there is a normal life waiting for us
the way things used to be
marie makes me feel that there is hope
i love her
i do i love her
i had the idea to transfer the 73
into a water canteen for better mobility
rigged for impact detonation
dont drop them eh
that was the empty one
no not funny jan
not funny
anthropoid proceed
stop
upmost importance
nothing about getting us out afterwards
theres a problem
one of our contacts inside the castle has seen correspondence
ordering heydrich back to berlin
and there have been conversations in the household
about a new posting to paris
it means that once he goes to berlin he may not be back
when does he leave
day after tomorrow
then we have no choice
we do it tomorrow
we do it tomorrow
what what is it
ladislav has received a new transmission from london
and
they agreed with my request to stand down the mission
we believe we see the situation clearly therefore given the situation
any actions against officials of the german reich
do not come into consideration
let the jindra group know
no
ladislav
ive just decoded a message from london
proceed upmost importance
but this clearly states you must stand down
you are deluded this is for jindra
so how can we recognize this
then at least wait for us to clarify it
it may have superseded your order
we have no time
after tomorrow heydrich will be gone
i agree with josef
i dont think this is a direct command
i believe its purpose is to calm the nerves in jindra
i know you all doubt me
no ladislav
please stop
suspect me of collaboration
i know youve had me followed
i understand you dont trust me but
if i was an informer for the gestapo do you think you would still be here
do you
then you tell me ladislav
what are you afraid of
i fear czechoslovakia will be wiped from the map
you ask me if im afraid
yes im afraid
jan uncle we do it tomorrow
as planned
may god be with you
jan
ive shot at men in the field
never killed one up close
give me the gun give me the gun
i dont want to die tomorrow
give me the gun
breathe breathe
now
thank you mrs moravec thank you
okay breathe breathe
breathe breathe jan
good
now as we were trained
as we were trained
concentrate on the detail
good
good
good
we are not afraid
jan we are not afraid
czechoslovakia is not afraid
huh
i will wait for you up the street
uncle said we werent needed for a while
is it today
promise me
we have plenty of time
wheres curda
never mind
valčík you take this street behind me
we have some sun so take this
if he approaches without an armed escort then use it to signal
and if he does
then then light a cigarette
when the car slows to take the corner
i will step out and open fire with the sten gun
this will signal the attack
jan you stand behind the attack point
so you can throw grenades at the armed escort if there is one
opálka you try a slow walk across here
as he approaches maybe you can slow him down before he takes the corner
is that clear
yeah
good luck
all good
good
as we were trained
lets move
stop
where were you curda
i didnt think that you were really going to do it
its all over the radio you shot him
the radio said 20000 ss troops have been drafted in to look for us
i need to get my family out of prague
no curda
no one is going anywhere curda
you try and run now and they will pick you up before you reach the city limits
you go home to your family you stay calm you shut your mouth
you think you can do that huh
yeah
we failed curda
failed no
we failed
jan
jan
the sten
im sorry
karl frank has temporarily taken heydrichs place
and has proclaimed a state of emergency and a curfew
a reward of 10 million crowns will be given for any information
that leads to the arrest of the criminals
anyone caught aiding the criminals
will be shot along with his entire family
what went wrong out there
we didnt even kill him
wounded
how bad
its hard to say
the ss still have the hospital surrounded
so presumably hes still alive
it seems like the germans have more men and guns up there
than on the eastern front
they have taken several thousand hostages
so what do we do now
nothing is leaving or entering prague
they are searching door to door
we have no safe houses left
so where do we go
ive asked father vladimir petrek
he has agreed to hide
all the parachutists that are still here in prague
until we can return you to london
wait here a few hours
i will find a safe route to the cathedral
hey
tell me
tell me
marie marie
marie
marie marie
marie
its okay its okay
its okay its okay
the germans were rounding up hostages off the street and
she tried to escape
its okay
its okay its okay
josef
jan
stop stop josef stop
stop josef
its my fault
josef its not your fault
its my fault
josef listen to me
listen to me
its my fault
stop listen to me listen to me
youre risking the lives of everyone
for what to shoot a few germans
shes gone josef shes gone
its not your fault huh
its my fault
its not your fault
its my fault
its not your fault josef
its not your fault okay
i am sorry jan
im sorry marie
mrs moravec im sorry
hey
hey its okay its okay
its okay
father petrek will meet you in there
ill send food with ata go go
thank you
i regret nothing
you are the bravest men i have ever met
im father petrek welcome
please come with me
this is our hidden crypt
you will be safe there
thank you father
you made it
josef
gentlemen
this is švarc bublík and hrubý
they are from the airdrop this spring
boredom may be the biggest enemy we have here
im suggesting three men on guard duty in the nave balcony at all times
we rotate every six hours
these three take first watch
im sorry it wasnt the outcome we all hoped for
none more than us
reinhard heydrich has died in hospital
a direct result of the injuries sustained in the attack
yesterday the germans went to a village lidice
and shot every man over the age of 16
the women and children have been taken to camps
and the buildings were razed to the ground
there has been talk that the village aided you somehow
ive never even been to lidice
these are dangerous times
mere gossip wipes a whole village from the face of the earth
today karl frank issued an amnesty broadcast
a full pardon for any person and their family
in exchange for any information about the assassins
even if they did not come forward before
but there is a deadline of five days
after that they plan to execute 30000 czechs
this must stop
what do you propose
me and josef will go to a park
place placards around our necks saying that we killed heydrich
and commit suicide
jan
stupid talk
this is stupid talk
as a soldier it is your duty to stay alive and continue fighting
do you understand that warrant officer kubiš
the responsibility does not rest with you
we know who is responsible
they will have to answer eventually and they will
if i didnt believe that i would not be here now
thank you father
ata
have you seen marie
is she well
beyond this brickwork and masonry
there is a large main sewer that empties into the river
how do you know
i found some plans in father petreks office
now if we can chisel through this we have a means of escape
escape to where
well until the british send plans for our rescue we are stuck here
but should we be discovered there is no way out
i would like us at least to have this option
we would then take our chances in the streets
two men should be working here at all times
whats her name
lenka
earlier what jan said
about taking your own lives
was he serious
maybe
cowards die many times before their deaths
the valiant never taste death but once
shakespeare
you say you know the men who assassinated
reichsprotektor reinhard heydrich
but you didnt take part in it
you say you dont know where they are but you know the family who sheltered them
no please please no
you walked in here on your own accord to give us this statement
you say you are a true patriot and the reason for doing that
is because you want to protect your family
and for the killing of innocent czechs to stop
and you say your name is
karel curda
chalupský
ah
where are the parachutists
i know nothing
you must be confusing us with other moravecs
where are the parachutists
please let me clean myself up before i leave
go on then
my son is a violinist
tell them he knows nothing of this please
in the toilet
something triggered it
maybe other members of the church found out
opálka what did i miss
bishop gorazd has talked to father petrek
apparently our presence here is endangering the church
he wants us to leave
but petrek has talked to hajsky and there is a plan to get us all out
when
two in the coffins two under the dummy floors
and the other three disguised as pall bearers
thats the seven
how soon can you be ready
you like to play the violin
maybe you would like to see your mother again
yes we managed to save her
no no
no
we saved her head
where are the assassins
where are the assassins
where are they hiding
please stop
where are the assassins
where are they hiding
stop
where are they
theyre in the church
in the cyril and methodius church
the germans are surrounding the church
we have to warn the others
