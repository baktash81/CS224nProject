caught on one of the branches on the way down 
can you walk 
you ll need stitches 
hey 
you didn t hide your parachutes very well 
and you left a blood trail for half a kilometer 
follow me 
i live not far from here 
dik  come 
ignác 
ignác 
hot soup  come 
come in 
i take it you are heading for prague 
how far is it 
thirty kilometers 
i have a special delivery permit for my truck 
i could take you 
thank you 
you rest here tonight 
i will take you in the morning 
enjoy your soup 
please  sit 
how much do the germans pay you 
for turning in your fellow countrymen  huh 
drop the gun 
i said  drop the gun 
drop it 
drop the gun 
gun 
you get him 
we ll take that truck 
come on 
they had made their choice  jan 
sometimes you have to pick a side 
would you prefer it was us 
should be the next left 
pull over here 
mirek  come away from the window 
anna  get the door 
yes 
we are looking for oldrich novák 
the novákovi no longer live here 
who is it 
just somebody looking for directions 
i am sorry  but that s all i know 
please 
can you help us 
there is a veterinarian in the next row of shops up the street 
i hear he is a good man 
one that may help 
thank you 
he normally only barks at germans 
mmm mmm  germans and anyone giving him a rectal examination 
thank you  dr  eduard 
come along  benés 
look after him  mrs  lukešová 
normally  for a dog bite  you would go to a hospital  not a vet 
did you know oldrich novák 
yes 
and what if we were to say that oldrich novák was our contact here in prague 
then i would have to wonder
if you are ill informed czech patriots
or gestapo spies trying to infiltrate what remains of the resistance 
i don t detect a german accent 
the decoding papers in your bag  they don t have a german font 
and given that this wound
has more tree bark than dog bite 
i would have to guess that you were parachuted back into czechoslovakia
with information that was somewhat out of date 
you re a clever man 
we were also told you were a good man 
how long have you been away 
it s been a while 
rewards are given to people who inform on anti nazi activity 
heydrich has all but crushed the resistance 
he has executed thousands 
i can put you in contact with the miller 
maybe he can help you 
you can stay here tonight 
i ll contact the miller in the morning 
my friend here says that you are a clever man 
i agree 
don t do anything that would change our opinion 
go easy on the foot 
you will be dancing the tango within a week 
whoa  whoa  whoa   
this is břetislav 
the miller 
eduard told me you were looking for oldrich novák 
yes 
would you like to take a drive with me 
don t move 
please sit 
you were looking for oldrich novák 
who gave you this contact 
london 
and you tell us this because 
you are not giving us much choice and this doesn t look like gestapo headquarters 
you  where are you from 
your accent  bohemia 
no  dolní vilémovice  moravia 
so you must know the railway station at vladislav 
yes 
what s so special about it 
i presume you are talking about the large bed of colored roses
that when seen from above is in the shape of our national flag 
is it still there 
seems the germans have still not looked at it from above 
i am vanek 
ladislav vanek 
this is uncle hajsky 
we are the head of the jindra organization 
czech resistance 
i am jan kubiš 
i am josef gabčík 
from slovakia 
you must not be surprised by our lack of trust 
the gestapo have been very successful in infiltrating our network 
oldrich novák 
he was taken away several months ago 
why wasn t london informed 
we lost contact with the czech government in exile in london some months ago 
we need replacement crystals for the transmitter 
we ve been waiting for them to send someone to re establish contact 
is that you 
there were other men on the plane 
they were dropped elsewhere 
it s possible they have orders
to re establish contact with london but that   
that is not our mission 
what is your mission 
operation anthropoid 
anthropoid 
what is anthropoid 
we are here to assassinate
ss obergruppenfűhrer reinhard heydrich 
are you completely mad 
  we have our orders  comrade 
  but this is madness 
we have our orders  comrade 
heydrich 
why stop with heydrich 
why not have a go at hitler as well 
he is only 300 kilometers down the road in a small village called berlin 
so we inform london that you are refusing to cooperate with our mission 
how dare you question us 
how dare you question us 
you know what we have sacrificed for the cause here 
what you have sacrificed 
what has czechoslovakia sacrificed 
you have no idea what we ve sacrificed 
sit down  please 
you kill heydrich and hitler will tear prague apart 
i take it you have family in czechoslovakia 
father  mother 
you kill heydrich  then you can consider them and everyone that ever knew you dead 
all czech patriots should be ready to die for their country 
that includes my family 
well  i m not 
i want to carry on fighting 
we don t have that many left that are willing to do that 
we are what s left of the czech resistance 
i suggest a lesser rank should be assassinated 
perhaps a few of them 
heydrich is the head of the secret police 
only hitler and himmler are above him in the nazi hierarchy 
exactly my point 
you really think you ll ever get close enough to assassinate heydrich 
our orders have come direct from the czech government in london 
so this is about the czech government in london trying to impress the allies 
it was the allies that gave us to the germans in the first place 
munich was a betrayal 
but it is also now history 
i think what the czech government in london is asking is this 
is czechoslovakia
still ready and willing to resist nazi germany 
josef gabčík 
and jan kubiš 
you are both most welcome here 
and please call me auntie moravec 
ata  ata 
ata is my son 
he is studying to be a violinist 
ata  this is josef and this is jan 
pleased to meet you both 
so  try not to go outside 
but if you do  never walk together 
if you re stopped  you will need an excuse for why you re not at work 
we ll try to get you medical certificates as soon as possible 
always use our code  three knocks  then a single knock 
in the meantime 
lay low and i will use ata to make contact 
good luck 
thank you 
goodbye 
come on through  please 
josef 
there is a way off the roof 
there is a fire escape to the left 
to the right it continues to the building next door 
it s good enough 
i m sure you both would like a glass of becherovka 
thank you 
  it s okay 
  mrs  moravec 
  hey 
  hey 
there was so much people at the market 
but i didn t find the bread that you like 
come 
  who is it 
  it s okay  marie 
this is josef and this is jan 
they will be staying with us while they are looking for work 
  pleased to meet you 
  hello 
  hello 
  hello 
josef and jan are not registered with the police
as being residents here  so  remember  please keep it strictly to yourself 
i ll put the shopping in the kitchen 
welcome 
mrs  kovárníková s daughter 
i pay her for helping out 
dinner will be at 6 00 
please sit 
ata  dinner is ready 
and finally the fiddler is silent 
he is a violinist  alois  a violinist 
you two boys looking for work  then 
yes 
we are always looking for men to clean the cinders out of the locomotives 
thank you  mr  moravec 
we ll keep that in mind 
so  what do you do when you aren t helping out here 
you don t have a boyfriend 
no 
how s life in occupied prague  marie 
i guess  not being registered with the police as residents
has something to do with this question 
i hate the germans 
and tell me  do you have a friend
as lovely as you that   
that you can trust 
why 
it would be less conspicuous if jan and i were not seen out alone 
young love flourishes under german occupation 
that sort of thing 
but you re not that young 
knowing that you are trustworthy is one thing  marie 
but doing this could get you shot 
perhaps you should think about it   
my friend  lenka 
she sometimes carries messages for uncle hajsky 
good 
we are going to a new year s eve dance tomorrow night 
would you like to go 
look at them 
it s like   
it s like some old ritual that s lost its joy 
maybe there s hope in the pretense 
hello 
it looks like you ve landed on your feet with lenka 
this was a mistake 
hello 
lenka  this is jan and josef 
  you know  it s not very polite   
  please sit down 
you are the most beautiful women in the room 
congratulations 
but you fail to understand this is   
this is not a night off for us 
this is not some game 
josef  maybe you re overreacting a little   
jan  take a look around 
we appreciate the effort  but the point was not to attract attention 
we needed you as plain as possible 
do you understand 
you know  for most girls 
a little lipstick is the only way to forget what s happening here 
even if it s just for a few hours 
yes 
your lipstick gets you noticed 
and that gets us noticed 
and us being noticed gets us all shot 
this little scene needs an ending 
slap my face 
slap my face 
i m not a whore 
i think that went well 
nine    eight    seven   
six    five    four    three    two    one 
a british sten mark ii machine gun 
one hundred rounds 
and model 73 anti tank grenades with pencil fuses 
that s everything we could retrieve from the drop canister 
uncle says he has made some progress with the information you asked for 
there is a meeting at café moravia on vodičkova street 
tuesday  2 00 
i just wanted to apologize about the other night 
you were completely right to do what you did 
marie didn t fully inform me about the situation 
she is very young 
she still has romantic ideas about the war 
and you 
war is not romantic 
we cross here 
after our last date  i thought you might both show wearing potato sacks 
i don t know what i m doing 
you are doing fine 
take a seat here  order a drink 
we won t be long 
josef 
  jan 
  opálka 
valčík 
i see you are no strangers to one another  but we don t have much time 
we all trained special operations together 
valčík here was even on the same drop 
yes  dropped 10 minutes later and 30 miles off course 
thanks to valčík and his group silver a 
we have finally re established communications with london 
i have orders to send and receive any communications between you and london 
you have your own decoder book  right 
yes 
second lieutenant opálka and warrant officer curda
have completed operation out distance  so both are now available to assist you 
second lieutenant opálka is the senior officer here 
yes  this is true  but your mission objective supersedes my rank 
we had word from london  anthropoid 
utmost priority 
we assist with everything possible 
so   
this is your show  bratři 
so  we know that heydrich returns to his family
every day at panenské břežany 
but  both his chateau and the castle are both heavily guarded 
they are not feasible targets 
but once a month 
he also travels to berlin  by train 
and we can predict this
because his personal carriages are prepared several days in advance 
but  again  the station and the train are both heavily guarded 
what about derailing the train outside of prague 
we can derail the train  but that is no guarantee that heydrich is killed 
i have made contact with an ex pupil of mine
who works as a repair man inside the castle 
he s willing to help 
but he only knows when heydrich arrives in the morning
and when he leaves 
what good is that 
you can build a picture
of his routine 
sometimes he travels with an armed escort and sometimes he does not 
perhaps there is a pattern in this 
there is a safe house near the castle 
the repairman could drop off the timetable every day before work 
lenka or marie could collect it 
good 
and jan and i will follow the route from the chateau to the castle 
gentlemen  this operation
will involve almost everyone we have left in the resistance 
so many have been captured by the gestapo 
if you are arrested  you will face some harsh facts 
there will be no escape 
you ll be tortured until you reveal everything you know 
and then you will be executed 
you must protect your fellow comrades
by shutting down any links you have to them 
operation out distance has re supplied us with these 
carry the cyanide capsules at all times 
we have to end our meeting 
use the window 
clear 
looks like there s a whole garrison there 
that s our man 
five minutes after 9 00 
he s riding solo today 
wait 
armed escort 
thirty seconds behind 
thirty seconds 
thirty seconds  30 seconds 
if we can use a rope or a steel cable to stop the mercedes 
then 30 seconds   
then 30 seconds would be all we need 
even if a rope can stop the car 
we still need more than 30 seconds to escape from here 
and we d have to face the armed guard here in the open 
it would not be my first choice 
and if it s our only choice 
the point of the mission is to succeed  yes 
i m more worried that we haven t planned what to do if we are successful 
what happens afterwards is not important 
let s follow the route to the castle 
well 
arrived 9 15  left 5 15 
with an armed escort 
armed escort 
there s only one person in prague that travels with an armed escort 
are you going to assassinate heydrich 
what 
heydrich is the target 
for your own safety  it s best that you don t ask too many questions 
it s a bit too late for that now 
well  you agreed to help the resistance 
who the target is should not concern you 
we are about to help you assassinate reinhard heydrich 
  of course it concerns us 
  okay 
everyone just relax 
maybe it was a mistake not to inform you of the danger 
  murder heydrich 
  no  no 
assassinate heydrich 
murder implies he has a life worth living 
so you think we are just two little girls
who are here to follow the important parachutists around 
whoa  lenka 
we ve been resisting here from the beginning in our own way 
i personally don t have any reservation to killing a nazi pig 
but don t treat us like what you are about to do doesn t affect us 
it does and it will 
and you should keep your weapon clean because it s filthy 
marie 
where are all my pots and pans 
this exit here  is this 
you see 
it s the slowest part of the route 
anywhere else is impossible 
so we do it here 
agreed 
yes 
perhaps not perfect  but it s the best option 
good 
9 17 to 4 41 
without 
are you really going to go through with this 
we have our orders 
so  you kill heydrich 
what then 
you think there aren t more like him 
they come and the killing continues even worse than it did before 
when does it stop 
i wish i had an answer for you 
you think any of this makes sense to me 
then walk away now 
and go where  marie 
you think we can escape from what is happening here 
pretend this madness is not real 
some days i m not even sure it is real 
heydrich chokes the people of this city with a blanket of fear 
people are shot for what 
their race  their religion 
their cigarettes 
you hear the stories about poland 
marie  it s okay 
just tell me we are doing the right thing 
i think it is my turn to apologize to you about the other morning 
you were right to be angry 
we should have told you what was at risk 
given you the choice to walk away 
my father was a captain in the army 
wanted sons  got three daughters 
he and many others were arrested in  39
when germany took control over czechoslovakia 
and when heydrich took over here last september 
his first order was to execute all the prisoners 
my father was among 5 000 shot in the first week by heydrich 
for me there s no walking away 
heydrich is worth the risk 
we have checked the route 
we think we know how to do it 
i will arrange a meeting 
at the cafe  the day after tomorrow 
3 00 p m 
our original contact  oldrich novák 
who was his direct handler 
ladislav vanek 
he is the one who s most opposed to what we have to do 
all i m asking is what is he so afraid of 
jan 
sorry 
so he approaches here 
corner of kirchmayer and holeschowitzer street 
here 
yes  his car will have to really slow down to take that corner 
yes  he slows to about 10 miles per hour 
we ve averaged out his morning arrival times 
we can expect him at approximately 9 30 a m 
and the weapons 
at that range the sten gun should hit everything within the car 
and the armed escort 
we have found no pattern 
some days  yes  some days  no 
if there is an armed escort 
we stand down and await the next day 
you know i have been against this action from the start 
yes  that s been clear 
i cannot give the go ahead without asking london to reconsider 
ladislav  this is a military operation 
it s not your order to give   
without the resistance  this mission doesn t exist 
do you want to put   
i am with ladislav 
we should get london to rethink our position here in prague 
we have our orders  curda 
and nothing has changed 
it s easy for london to give orders 
it s our lives on the line   
let s wait for re confirmation 
we waited four months 
four months 
london needs action 
then a few more days won t make a difference 
valčík  how long before you can get to the transmitter 
i can get to the transmitter the day after tomorrow 
then a couple of days for london to transmit back the answer 
happy birthday 
  happy birthday 
  happy birthday 
  happy birthday  ata 
  thank you 
  cheers 
  cheers 
cheers 
cheers 
  it s beautiful 
  thank you 
uh   
ata  i know this is your party 
but we have a little announcement to make 
i have asked marie to marry me and she has said yes 
congratulations 
  congratulations 
  thank you 
thank you 
congratulations 
thank you 
why are we here 
hmm 
i know 
i know 
who s to say it won t happen 
london calls it off 
you re lying to yourself  my friend 
because it is easier 
i have to believe there is a way through this 
that there is a normal life waiting for us 
the way things used to be 
marie makes me feel that there is hope 
i love her 
i do  i love her 
i had the idea to transfer the 73
into a water canteen for better mobility 
rigged for impact detonation 
don t drop them  eh 
that was the empty one 
no  not funny  jan 
not funny 
 anthropoid proceed 
 stop 
 upmost importance  
nothing about getting us out afterwards 
there s a problem 
one of our contacts inside the castle has seen correspondence
ordering heydrich back to berlin 
and there have been conversations in the household
about a new posting to paris 
it means that once he goes to berlin  he may not be back 
when does he leave 
day after tomorrow 
then we have no choice 
we do it tomorrow 
we do it tomorrow 
what  what is it 
ladislav has received a new transmission from london 
and 
they agreed with my request to stand down the mission 
we believe we see the situation clearly  therefore  given the situation 
any actions against officials of the german reich
do not come into consideration 
let the jindra group know 
no 
ladislav 
i ve just decoded a message from london 
 proceed  upmost importance  
but this clearly states you must stand down 
you are deluded  this is for jindra 
so how can we recognize this 
then at least wait for us to clarify it 
it may have superseded your order 
we have no time 
after tomorrow heydrich will be gone 
i agree with josef 
i don t think this is a direct command 
i believe its purpose is to calm the nerves in jindra 
i know you all doubt me 
  no  ladislav   
  please stop 
suspect me of collaboration 
i know you ve had me followed 
i understand you don t trust me  but 
if i was an informer for the gestapo  do you think you would still be here 
do you 
then you tell me  ladislav 
what are you afraid of 
i fear czechoslovakia will be wiped from the map 
you ask me if i m afraid 
yes  i m afraid 
jan  uncle  we do it tomorrow 
as planned 
may god be with you 
jan 
i ve shot at men in the field 
never killed one up close 
give me the gun  give me the gun 
  i don t want to die tomorrow 
  give me the gun 
breathe  breathe 
now   
thank you  mrs  moravec  thank you 
okay  breathe  breathe 
breathe  breathe  jan 
good 
now  as we were trained 
as we were trained 
concentrate on the detail 
good 
good 
good 
we are not afraid 
jan  we are not afraid 
czechoslovakia is not afraid 
huh 
i will wait for you up the street 
uncle said we weren t needed for a while 
is it today 
promise me 
we have plenty of time 
8 25 
where s curda 
never mind 
valčík  you take this street behind me 
we have some sun  so take this 
if he approaches without an armed escort  then use it to signal 
and if he does 
then    then light a cigarette 
when the car slows to take the corner 
i will step out and open fire with the sten gun 
this will signal the attack 
jan  you stand behind the attack point
so you can throw grenades at the armed escort if there is one 
opálka  you try a slow walk across here 
as he approaches  maybe you can slow him down before he takes the corner 
is that clear 
yeah 
good luck 
  all good 
  good 
as we were trained 
let s move 
stop 
where were you  curda 
i didn t think that you were really going to do it 
it s all over the radio  you shot him 
the radio said 20 000 ss troops have been drafted in to look for us 
i need to get my family out of prague 
no  curda 
no one is going anywhere  curda 
you try and run now and they will pick you up before you reach the city limits 
you go home to your family  you stay calm  you shut your mouth 
  you think you can do that  huh 
  yeah 
  we failed  curda 
  failed  no 
we failed 
jan 
jan 
the sten   
i m sorry 
karl frank has temporarily taken heydrich s place 
and has proclaimed a state of emergency and a curfew 
a reward of 10 million crowns will be given for any information
that leads to the arrest of the criminals 
anyone caught aiding the criminals
will be shot  along with his entire family 
what went wrong out there 
we didn t even kill him 
wounded 
how bad 
it s hard to say 
the ss still have the hospital surrounded 
so presumably  he s still alive 
it seems like the germans have more men and guns up there
than on the eastern front 
they have taken several thousand hostages 
so  what do we do now 
nothing is leaving or entering prague 
they are searching door to door 
we have no safe houses left 
so  where do we go 
i ve asked father vladimir petrek 
he has agreed to hide
all the parachutists that are still here in prague
until we can return you to london 
wait here  a few hours 
i will find a safe route to the cathedral 
hey 
tell me 
tell me 
  marie  marie 
  marie 
  marie  marie 
  marie 
it s okay  it s okay 
it s okay  it s okay 
the germans were rounding up hostages off the street and   
she tried to escape 
it s okay 
it s okay  it s okay 
  josef 
  jan 
stop  stop  josef  stop 
  stop  josef 
  it s my fault 
  josef  it s not your fault 
  it s my fault 
josef  listen to me 
  listen to me 
  it s my fault 
stop  listen to me  listen to me 
you re risking the lives of everyone 
for what  to shoot a few germans 
she s gone  josef  she s gone 
it s not your fault  huh 
  it s my fault 
  it s not your fault 
  it s my fault 
  it s not your fault  josef 
it s not your fault  okay 
i am sorry  jan 
i m sorry  marie 
mrs  moravec  i m sorry 
hey 
hey  it s okay  it s okay 
it s okay 
father petrek will meet you in there 
i ll send food with ata  go  go 
thank you 
i regret nothing 
you are the bravest men i have ever met 
i m father petrek  welcome 
please  come with me 
this is our hidden crypt 
you will be safe there 
thank you  father 
you made it 
josef 
gentlemen 
this is švarc  bublík and hrubý 
they are from the airdrop this spring 
boredom may be the biggest enemy we have here 
i m suggesting three men on guard duty in the nave balcony at all times 
we rotate every six hours 
these three take first watch 
i m sorry it wasn t the outcome we all hoped for 
none more than us 
reinhard heydrich has died in hospital 
a direct result of the injuries sustained in the attack 
yesterday  the germans went to a village  lidice 
and shot every man over the age of 16 
the women and children have been taken to camps 
and the buildings were razed to the ground 
there has been talk that the village aided you somehow 
i ve never even been to lidice 
these are dangerous times 
mere gossip wipes a whole village from the face of the earth 
today karl frank issued an amnesty broadcast 
a full pardon for any person and their family
in exchange for any information about the assassins 
even if they did not come forward before 
but there is a deadline of five days 
after that  they plan to execute 30 000 czechs 
  this must stop 
  what do you propose 
me and josef will go to a park 
place placards around our necks saying that we killed heydrich
and commit suicide 
  jan 
  stupid talk 
this is stupid talk 
as a soldier  it is your duty to stay alive and continue fighting 
do you understand that  warrant officer kubiš 
the responsibility does not rest with you 
we know who is responsible 
they will have to answer eventually  and they will 
if i didn t believe that  i would not be here now 
thank you  father 
ata 
have you seen marie 
is she well 
beyond this brickwork and masonry 
there is a large main sewer that empties into the river 
how do you know 
i found some plans in father petrek s office 
now  if we can chisel through this  we have a means of escape 
escape to where 
well  until the british send plans for our rescue  we are stuck here 
but should we be discovered  there is no way out 
i would like us at least to have this option 
we would then take our chances in the streets 
two men should be working here at all times 
what s her name 
lenka 
earlier  what jan said   
about taking your own lives 
was he serious 
maybe 
 cowards die many times before their deaths 
 the valiant never taste death but once  
shakespeare 
you say you know the men who assassinated
reichsprotektor reinhard heydrich 
but you didn t take part in it 
you say you don t know where they are  but you know the family who sheltered them 
no  please    please  no 
you walked in here on your own accord to give us this statement 
you say you are a true patriot and the reason for doing that
is because you want to protect your family
and for the killing of innocent czechs to stop 
and you say your name is   
karel curda 
chalupský 
ah 
where are the parachutists 
i know nothing
