  not for long 
whoa 
  whoa 
  aah  aaah 
 ump 
whoa 
whoo 
you don t think we ll
get in trouble for this  do you 
no  not a chance 
why do the gods
torment me   
with such reckless 
destructive 
  blasphemous sons 
  father  hear what i 
be still 
pharaoh speaks 
i seek to build
an empire 
and your only thought
is to amuse yourselves   
by tearing it down 
have i taught you nothing 
you mustn t be so hard on yourself  your
ma esty  you re an excellent teacher 
it s not your fault
your sons learned nothing 
  they learned blasphemy 
  true 
father 
the fault is mine 
i goaded rameses on 
and so i am responsible 
hmm 
responsible 
do you know the meaning
of that word  rameses 
i understand  father 
and do you understand the task for which
your birth has destined you 
the ancient traditions 
when i pass
into the next world 
then you will be
the morning and evening star 
one damaged temple does not
destroy centuries of tradition 
but one weak link
can break the chain   
of a mighty dynasty 
you have my leave to go 
father 
father 
you know it was
really my fault 
must you be
so hard on him 
moses  you will never
have to carry a burden   
like the crown
i will pass to rameses 
he must not allow himself
to be led astray 
not even by you  my son 
all he cares about is 
is your approval 
i know he will live up
to your expectations 
he only needs
the opportunity 
maybe  maybe so 
go now  i shall
see you both tonight 
  well  that went well 
   ust go away 
could have been worse 
 the weak link in the chain   
that s what he called me 
well  you are
rather pathetic 
irresponsible 
ignorant of the traditions 
he practically accused me
of bringing down the dynasty 
yeah  i can see it now 
there go the pyramids 
you can laugh about it 
statues cracking and toppling over 
the nile drying up 
single handedly  you will manage to bring
the greatest kingdom on earth to ruin 
tell me this  moses 
why is it that every time
you start something 
i m the one
who ends up in trouble 
ah  man  oh 
  ah  it s rameses  you re in trouble 
  get down here 
  i think you owe us an apology 
  oh  my new thing 
  i am so upset 
  you might as well 
  you ll pay for this 
  we re gonna tell the pharaoh 
hmm 
  oh  look at me  i m drenched again 
  hey  i figured it out 
  you know what your problem is  rameses 
  what 
  you care too much    and your
problem is  you don t care at all 
oh  in that case  i suppose
you care a lot more than i do   
that we re late for the banquet 
for example 
i m done for 
  father will kill me 
  don t worry 
nobody will even
notice us coming in 
 nobody will
even notice   
ah  the young princes 
rameses  you were  ust
named prince regent 
you are now responsible
for overseeing all the temples 
i suggest
you get over there   
and thank your father 
apparently  moses 
someone thought he   
 ust needed
the opportunity 
my lord pharaoh 
i propose that the high priests
offer tribute   
to their new regent 
an excellent idea 
hotep  huy 
  huy 
  hmm 
  the midian girl 
  that s a good idea 
go get her 
by the power of ra 
we present for your
delectation and delight   
an exotic apparition
stolen from a faraway land 
  we offer you this
delicate desert flower 
let us inspect
this    desert flower 
more like a desert cobra 
not much of a snake
charmer  are you 
that s why i
give her to you 
  no  that s generous  but 
  i won t be given to anyone 
especially an arrogant 
pampered palace brat 
are you going to
let her talk to you like that 
you will show the proper respect
for a prince of egypt 
but i am showing you
all the respect you deserve 
none 
no  wait 
  be still 
  untie this rope 
  i demand you set me free 
  be still 
  let go 
  as you wish 
aah  ohh

have her dried off   
and sent to
prince moses  chambers

in a basket to save your life

that you call  father   
  how dare you 
  god saved you to be our deliverer 
  enough of this 
  and you are  moses  you are the deliverer 
i said  enough

this night 
  hush now  my baby

  by the stream  
  sleep and remember  
  my last lullaby  
  so i ll be with you  
  when you dream   
did you see him  it s moses 
  gleaming in the moonlight  
  cool and clean
and all i ve ever known  
  all i ever wanted  
  sweet perfumes
of incense  
  and graceful rooms
of alabaster stone  
  all i ever wanted  
  this is my home  
  with my father
mother  brother  
  oh  so noble
oh  so strong  
  now i am home  
  here among my trappings
and belongings  
  i belong  
  and if anybody doubts it  
  they couldn t
be more wrong  
  i am a sovereign
prince of egypt  
  a son of the proud history
that s shown  
  etched on every wall  
  surely this is all
i ever wanted  
  all i ever wanted  
  all i ever  
  wanted   
the hebrews grew
too numerous 
they might have risen
against us 
father  tell me
you didn t do this 
moses 
sometimes 
for the greater good 
sacrifices must be made 
sacrifices 
oh  my son

granted me a vision 
i m not merely going to restore
this temple  i will make it more grand 
more splendid
than any other one in egypt 
aah

moses  look 
fate has turned our little misadventure
into a great opportunity 
  get up  old man 
  father will be so pleased 
put your back into it 
faster 
this is  ust
the beginning 
a gateway will open to an entire
new city of white limestone 
more dazzling
than the sun 
and here  a statue of hapi 
i said  hurry 
      two great column halls 
  stop it 
  somebody s got to stop this 
  there s nothing we can do

i am egypt  the morning
and the evening star 
if i say day is night 
it will be written 
and you will be
what i say you are 
i say you are innocent 
what you say does not matter 
you don t understand 
i can t stay here
any longer 
  moses 
  no 
all i ve ever known
to be true is a lie 
i m not who
you think i am 
what are you
talking about 
go ask the man
i once called  father   
moses 
please 
good bye  brother 
moses 
moses 
no 
aah 
aaah 
hey  wait 
please 
ohh 
oh 
what are you doing 
  help 
  let our sheep drink 
leave us alone 
get away 
stop it 
my father s
the high priest of midian 
you re going to be
in big trouble 
  aah 
  hey  you 
aren t these
your camels 
  hut hut 
  no  no  no  no 
  wait 
  wait  stop 
whoa 
what are you girls
doing 
we re trying to get the funny man
out of the well 
trying to get the funny man
out of the well 
  well  that s one
i ve never heard before 
oh  my 
oh  uh  don t worry down there 
uh  we ll get you out 
hold on 
you 
huh 
ohh 
mm hmm 
that s why papa says
she ll never get married 
you don t have to do this  ladies 
please  i m really  i m really quite 
no  not there  please 
that tickles  ladies 
you ve cleaned every inch of me 
whoa  i  i was wrong 
let me through  let me through 
i want to see him 
ah  you are most welcome 
you should not be
a stranger in this land 
you have been sent
as a blessing 
tonight  you shall be my honored guest 
my father   ethro 
high priest of midian 
psst  sit with me 
um  all right 
psst  not yet 
  oh  sorry 
  my children 
let us give thanks
for this bountiful food 
and let us also give thanks
for the presence   
of this brave  young man
whom we honor here tonight 
please  sir  i wish you wouldn t 
i ve done nothing in my life
worth honoring 
first  you rescue tzipporah
from egypt 
  then you defend my younger
daughters from brigands 
you think that is nothing 
it seems you do not know
what is worthy of honor 
  a single thread
in a tapestry  
  though its color
brightly shine  
  can never see
its purpose  
  in a pattern
of the grand design  
  and the stone that sits
on the very top  
  of the mountain s
mighty face  
  does it think
it s more important  
  than the stones
that form the base  
  so how can you see
what your life is worth  
  or where
your value lies  
  you can never see
through the eyes of man  
  you must look
at your life  
  look at your life
through heaven s eyes  
  la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la  
  la  la la la la la la  
  la la la la la la  
    lai lai lai  lai lai lai lai
lai lai lai  lai lai la     dance with me 
no  i don t know how 
  a lake of gold
in the desert sand  
  is less than
a cool  fresh spring  
  and to one lost sheep
a shepherd boy  
  is greater
than the richest king  
  if a man lose
everything he owns  
  has he truly
lost his worth  
  or is it the beginning  
  of a new and brighter birth  
  so how do you measure
the worth of a man  
  in wealth or strength
or size  
  in how much he gained
or how much he gave  
  the answer will come  
  the answer will come
to him who tries  
  to look at his life
through heaven s eyes  
  and that s why we share
all we have with you  
  though there s little
to be found  
  when all you ve got
is nothing  
  there s a lot
to go around  
  no life can escape
being blown about  
  by the winds
of change and chance  
    and though you never know
all the steps     dance with me 
  no  i  no  no 
    you must learn to  oin the dance  
  you must learn
to  oin the dance

  so how do you  udge
what a man is worth  
  by what he builds
or buys  
  you can never see
with your eyes on earth  
  look through
heaven s eyes  
  look at your life  
  look at your life
through heaven s  
  eyes   
mmm 
i love you 
ahh 
it s too early
for this 
moses

mother  yocheved  you are our brother 
what do you want

i have seen the oppression
of my people in egypt   
and have heard their cry 
  stop it 
leave that man alone 
so i have come down
to deliver them out of slavery   
and bring them
to a good land 
a land flowing
with milk and honey 
and so  unto pharaoh 
i shall send   
you 
me  wh who am i
to lead these people 
they ll never believe me 
they won t even listen 
i shall teach you
what to say

the man who slaughtered their children

the wrong messenger 
h  how can i even speak
to these people 
who made man s mouth 
who made the deaf  the mute 
the seeing or the blind 
did not i 
now go 
oh  moses 
i shall be with you when you
go to the king of egypt 
but pharaoh
will not listen 
so i will stretch out
my hand   
and smite egypt   
with all my wonders

and dreams   
and the promise
of a life with dignity 
that is what i want
for my people 
and that is why
i must do the task   
that god has given me

committed a serious crime against the gods 
we are loathe
to bring it up  mind you 
the law clearly states
the punishment for such a crime 
  death 
  we hesitate to say it 
be still 
pharaoh speaks 
i am the morning
and the evening star 
rameses 
it shall be as i say 
i pardon forever all crimes
of which he stands accused   
and will have it known
that he is   
our brother moses 
the prince of egypt 
rameses 
in my heart 
you are my brother 
but things cannot be
as they were

yes  aaron  it s true 
pharaoh has the power 
he can take away your food 
your home  your freedom 
he can take away
your sons and daughters 
with one word 
pharaoh can take away
your very lives 
but there is one thing
he cannot take away from you 
your faith 
believe 
for we will see
god s wonders 
  thus saith the lord  
  since you refuse
to free my people  
    since you refuse to free my people  
    since you refuse  
  all through
the land of egypt  
  i send a pestilence  a plague  
  into your house  into your bed  
    into your streams into your streets  
  hmm 
  into your drink
into your bread  
  upon your cattle  on your sheep  
  upon your oxen
in your field  
  into your dreams  into your sleep  
  until you break
until you yield  
  i send the swarm  
  i send the horde
thus saith the lord  
  once i called you brother  
  once i thought the chance
to make you laugh  
  was all i ever wanted  
  i send the thunder
from the sky  
  i send the fire
raining down  
  and even now i wish
that god had chose another  
  serving as your foe
on his behalf  
  is the last thing  
    that i wanted  
    i send a hail of burning ice  
  on every field
on every town  
  this was my home  
  all this pain and devastation
how it tortures me inside  
  all the innocent
who suffer  
  from your stubbornness  
    and pride  
    i send the locusts on the wind  
  such as the world
has never seen  
  on every leaf
on every stalk  
  until there s nothing left
of green  
  i send my scourge
i send my sword  
  thus saith the lord  
  you who i called brother  
  why must you call down another blow  
  i send my scourge
i send my sword  
    let my people go  
    thus saith the lord  
  thus saith the lord  
  you who i called brother  
  how could you have come
to hate me so  
  is this what you wanted  
  i sent the swarm
i sent the horde  
  then let my heart
be hardened  
  and never mind
how high the cost may grow  
  this will still be so  
  i will never let  
  your people go  
  thus saith the lord  
    i will not let  
    let  
    your people  
    my people  
    go   
    go   
rameses 
rameses 
oh  let me guess 
you want me to   
let your people go 
i hoped
i would find you here 
get out 
rameses  we must
bring this to an end 
rameses  please 
talk to me 
we could always
talk here 
this place 
so many memories 
i remember the time you   
switched the heads of the gods
of the temple of ra 
if i recall correctly 
you were there switching heads
right along with me 
no  it was you 
i didn t do that 
oh  yes  you did 
you put the hippo on the crocodile 
and the crocodile 
  on the falcon 
  yes 
the priest thought it was a horrible
omen and fasted for two months 
father was furious  you were
always getting me into trouble 
but then 
you were always there
to   
get me out of trouble
again 
hmmph 
why can t things be
the way they were before 
father 
it s so dark 
i m frightened 
why is he here 
isn t that the man
who did all this 
yes 
but one must wonder   
why 
because no kingdom should be made
on the backs of slaves 
rameses  your stubbornness
is bringing this misery upon egypt 
it would cease if only you
would let the hebrews go 
i will not be dictated to 
i will not be threatened 
i am the morning
and the evening star  i am pharaoh 
something else is coming  something
much worse than anything before 
please  let go of
your contempt for life   
before it destroys
everything you hold dear 
think of your son 
i do 
you hebrews have been
nothing but trouble 
my father had the right idea
about how to deal with your people 
  rameses    and i think
it s time i finished the  ob 
  rameses    and there shall be
a great cry in all of egypt   
such as never has been
or ever will be again 
rameses  you bring this
upon yourself 
god has come
to me again  saying 
 take a lamb   
and with its blood   
mark the lintel and posts
of every door 
for tonight   
i shall pass through
the land of egypt   
and smite
all the firstborn 
but when i see the blood
upon your door   
i will pass over you 
and the plague
shall not enter   
you
and your people   
have my permission to go 
leave me 
  many nights we ve prayed  
  with no proof  
  anyone could hear  
  in our hearts
a hopeful song  
  we barely understood  
  now we are not afraid  
  although we know
there s much to fear  
  we were moving mountains  
  long before
we knew we could  
  there can be miracles  
  when you believe  
  though hope is frail  
  it s hard to kill  
  who knows what miracles  
  you can achieve  
  when you believe  
  somehow you will  
  you will when you  
  believe  
  in this time of fear  
  when prayers so often
proved in vain  
  hope seemed like
the summer birds  
  too swiftly flown away  
    yet now i m standing here  
    now i m standing here  
  with heart so full
i can t explain  
  seeking faith
and speaking words  
  i never thought i d say  
  there can be miracles  
    when you believe  
    when you believe  
  though hope is frail  
    it s hard to kill  
    it s hard to kill
