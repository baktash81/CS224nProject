and  me  is getting out of here
just as fast as my goodyear radials can go 
dennis 
this is serious 
yes  a lot more serious
for me than for you 
you re a kid  what can they do 
spank you  ground you 
if they ground me  mud   
it s gonna be
in a concrete room   
with a vertical bar motif
and a 200 pound fiance named duke 
  dennis  you can t just leave 
  mud  it s gonna be okay 
here s what you do  get lost 
vanish into the woods for five  six hours

he took off 
so  what are you
doing here 
  uh  i thought i d hang out
in the woods for a while 
  right 
till your parents were so worried
they wouldn t think about punishing you 
something tells me
that wasn t your idea 
been planning this
for five  six years 
the camp idea
was perfect 
find kids with access
to cash   
get  em away from their parents 
lots of junk food 
win their confidence 
then start with the religious indoctrination 
  he didn t take off 
  no  i guess he didn t 
his title was  most high
and holy worship  
rama sri havagnoli 
  that s h a v a   
  nice try  dennis 
look  you guys   
this whole thing wasn t his idea 
it was my idea 
   sighs 
  ah  yes

very gullible 
he fell hook  line and sinker 
show  em your tattoo  mud 
okay  dennis

i can t believe nobody s pressing charges 
this guy s gonna walk 
not necessarily 
he still owes me 2 800 bucks in penalties 
who do i see about
gettin  a bench warrant 
excuse me  mr  polk  about the money
dennis owes you  i think this will cover it 
  you re a little short 
  well  you re a little fat 
if you sue him  what are you gonna get 
a couple winston churchill albums 
  please  come on
