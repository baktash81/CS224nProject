melodramatic  she ll turn up 
i called everyone 
nobody s seen her 
dad  don t worry 
i m sure everything s fine 
yeah 
i m going to my room 
yeah  it was weird  she didn t
leave a note or anything 
and dad is totally
freaking out 
where do you think she is 
maybe she finally left him 
she s been threatening to
for all these years 
well  was she  like 
acting weird or something 
no weirder than usual 
actually  no  last week
i came home from school
and i found her sleeping
in my bed 
what 
yeah  random  right 
when she woke up 
she seemed like 
all confused and out of it 
i think she was still
 half in a dream 
so  anyways  where the hell
were you today 
oh  yeah 
sorry  i    i was hanging out
at thomas   and   
and you were stoned 
uh  maybe 
you want me to come over 
i don t know  i kind of have
 a lot of homework to do 
since when do you give
a shit about homework 
my mom s been on my case
lately about my grades 
phil  we haven t had sex in 
like  over a week 
i miss fucking you 
same here  babe 
but  you know what they say 
absence makes
the heart get stronger 
yeah 
phil  are you in there 
i m on the phone 
could you come out here
for a minute  honey 
i heard a strange
noise outside 
you re always hearing
strange noises 
yeah  i ll be out
in a sec 
i gotta go  my crazy mom
is imagining things again 
hmm kay 
talk to you later 
okay 
so  no word 
you think we should
call the police 
i don t want them
coming here for all
the neighbors to see 
your mother
wouldn t like it 
if we don t hear
anything by morning 
let s take a drive
down to the station 
mom 
mom 
mom 
mom  what happened 
when i was little 
 my mother tried   
to curl my hair 
oh  well  we tried 
it looks a little fuller 
i suppose 
she named me katrina so
 that she could call me kat 
because she always
wanted a pet 
come here  kat  purr for me 
kitty  come on  purr 
purr  purr  purr 
that s it 
good  good little kitty 
for years
 i thought i was her pet 
kat  kat 
mama 
i m here  kat  i m here 
no more for you  god  you re
getting fatter by the hour 
my mother always wanted me
 to be a sylph  all lithe
and elegant like her 
and when i hit puberty  my body
changed seemingly overnight 
the bulk melting off like
 i was a snowman in the sun 
only  instead of finally
pleasing her 
that somehow made her
 resent me even more 
  do you love the boy 
  god  jesus  you scared me 
how long have you been
standing there 
sorry  i didn t mean
to startle you 
well  are you going
to answer my question 
  what question 
  that boy next door 
do you love him 
what are you talking about 
it s none of your business 
i don t love your father 
i can t stand him 
as a matter of fact 
what the fuck  why would
you say that to me  go fuckin 
tell it to someone else 
so no note  huh 
no  nothing 
you say she
didn t pack a bag 
well  nothing seems to be
missing as far as i can tell 
the detective was the
 polar opposite of men like
 my father  and phil 
he was the kind of man whoncarried a gun  got into fights 
killed things
 with his bare hands 
was she depressed  was she
on any kind of medication 
or taking anything 
she didn t kill herself 
if that s what you re
trying to imply 
well 
the good news is 
that there s no matches
at any of the hospitals
or morgue 
no evidence of foul play 
however  and i hate to be
the one to tell you this 
hundreds of wives
go missing every week 
if a woman wants to vanish 
buddy  she can 
are you saying there s
nothing we can do 
oh  sure there is 
i recommend you alert
your friends  your neighbors 
tell them to be
 on the lookout 
keep an eye on your bank
 account  your credit cards 
 for any kind of activity 
got an answering machine 
mm hm 
good  keep it on  your wife
might try to contact you 
feel free to call me
if anything comes up 
dad 
your mother never loved me 
i didn t know what to say 
 because i couldn t remember
 my mother
ever looking at my dad
 with anything but contempt 
maybe a zillion eons ago
when they were young 
 it was different 
it s perfect  right 
it s everything
i ve ever wanted 
she was tall 
 stunning 
like a movie star 
they were thenquintessential american couple 
the future unfurling before
them like some endless
magic carpet 
if homemaking was an art
 or science  my mother would
 have won a nobel prize 
but once the house
 is immaculate  and
 everything was in its place 
she had nothing left to do
but plan the emptiness
 of days to come 
and gradually  the beautiful
 woman she once was
became no more than a phantom nwandering away in a snowstorm 
hello  sweetheart 
what s for dinner 
  meatloaf 
  oh  yum 
your meatloaf
is the cat s meow 
so anyway  do you remember
that ticket i bought
at the office raffle 
  not really 
  well  guess what  i won 
  it s a crock pot 
  we don t need a crock pot 
what are you talking about 
these are the latest thing 
everyone s getting one 
you can make  uh  stews 
pot roast  chili 
well  i don t have time
to fuss with it now 
i have to finish dinner 
just put it out of the way  over
there  on top of the fridge 
he was her doormat 
 she treated him like shit
 and he let her 
so imagine my shock
 when i visited my father
 at work one day
and discovered he had game 
every woman there was into him 
 flirting with him  batting
 their eyelashes 
good morning  mr  connors 
and who is this pretty
young lady 
good morning  mindy  this is
kat  the new receptionist 
i was stunned 
these women actually
 thought my dad was hot 
but to my mother 
 he would always be pathetic 
a constant reminder
 of the unbearable repetition
and dullness of her life 
my parents  marriage was like
 a long drink of water from
 a frozen fountain 
so cold it turns your teeth
 to diamonds 
it was hardly a surprisento learn their sex life sucked 
meanwhile  my father had
 his own drawer of secrets 
so they just went on
 like that 
my mom never coming  my dad
 jacking off in the basement 
all the while pretending
 everythingwas fine 
that we were the perfect
 family living this
perfect fucking life 
pass the butter 
thank you 
there were times when
 i thought she was going mad 
that she was going
to suffocate my father
 one night with a pillow 
that she was going to burn
 the fucking house down 
but instead  she vanished 
how does that
make you feel 
i don t know 
you don t know 
  do you miss her 
  no  not really 
my dad made me see
 a shrink because he thought
i needed to process my feelings
about my mother leaving 
thing is 
 i didn t have any feelings 
dr  thaler reminds me of an
 actress playing a therapist 
and when we have a session 
i feel like an actress
 playing myself 
i  i act    i have been having
kind of weird dreams lately 
  a bad actress 
  doing a shitty job 
like  i m  um  i m driving
through this gnarly
snow storm
and i can t see anything 
 i mean  there s snow
 everywhere 
and then out of nowhere 
this figure appears 
i can t  like  make it out
in any detail or anything 
but i just somehow know
that it s my mother 
and i try to swerve  but i can
feel the car hit something 
i get out 
and i look all around
but there s no body  nothing 
just snow and blinding
whiteness everywhere 
i    i ve been having these
dreams ever since my mom left 
that s not unusual 
especially given the trauma
of your situation 
however  contrary to popular
belief  dreams don t necessarily
mean anything 
we all have strange dreams 
but in most cases 
it s just your brain s way
of letting off steam
at the end of the day 
oh 
i m worried
 about you  kat 
what do you mean 
this is too much
to deal with on your own 
is that shrink
you re seeing helping any 
i guess  i ve only been
a couple of times 
yeah  well  my mom said
therapy helped her a lot
after my dad left 
i still don t understand
how she could do this to you 
  she wanted out  i guess 
  so  that s no excuse 
least my dad told us
he was leaving 
he didn t just leave us
in the dark  wondering 
whatever  can we just
stop talking and fuck 
gotta get back
before my mom freaks out 
plus isn t your dad
coming home soon 
no  not for
at least an hour 
yeah  well  last thing i want
is for him to catch us again 
last time he got so mad i
thought he was gonna kill me 
just  give your shrink
a chance  will you 
all right 
seriously  you need to
let some of your anger out 
you re gonna crack 
just like your mom 
it s like a vicious circus 
catch you later 
i don t mean to sound crass 
but if i don t get some dick
soon i m going to explode 
join the fucking club 
sister 
look on the bright side 
at least you ve had real sex 
i m so paranoid about aids
i have to live vicariously
through you 
okay  well  the problem is that
once you ve had real sex 
it s  like  all
you can ever think about 
and phil barely even touches me
anymore  he  like  gives me
goodnight peck and that s it 
what  that s fucked up 
i know  it s  like 
we re some old married couple 
maybe you should bang that hot
detective you re so into 
what  what are you talking
about  he s  like  40 
that s not even legal
i don t think 
kat  he s a cop  if anyone knows
how to do shit without getting
caught  he does 
yeah  plus you ll be 18
in a few weeks anyway 
okay  whatever   i am
not screwing a 40 year old cop 
okay 
  back to the problem at hand  getting phil to fuck me 
well  have you talked
to him about it 
i tried  all he says is that 
uh  he s got a lot on his mind 
and that i need
to cut him some slacks 
oh my god 
what a fucking moron 
i know  i know phil s not the
brightest crayon in the box 
that is the understatement
of the century 
that s what i kind of like
about him  you know 
it s just simple 
i know that sounds perverse 
but he s kind of like my dad
in that way 
you can scratch the surface
and there s just more surface 
i m gonna get straight cs 
show me 
my god 
you re so fuckin  crazy 
phil is literally
 the boy next door 
and when he and his
 mother moved in last year 
 i instantly despised him 
he was so dull
 and stupid 
i made fun of him  even earned
a special nickname  garbage 
but then  one night that
 summer  everything changed 
me  beth and mickey 
 we were doing what we did
 every wednesday 
and even more bored
 than usual 
sometimes i wish someone would
burn this place to the ground
  so we didn t have
to come here anymore 
  oh  tell me about it 
every week it s the same
fucking people with
the same fucking songs
in the exact same
fucking order 
  oh my god 
  what 
look what the bats
dragged in 
what the hell
is garbage doing here 
oh  shit 
he s coming over here 
what a fucking freak 
guys  be cool  come on 
  hey

the street from me

or coffee  mrs  connors

and please  call me eve 
so   
   what can i help
you with  eve 
well  it seems my daughter kat
and your son are dating 
yeah  i know  they re going to
some big fancy dance next week 
  fall formal 
  ah  the   
that s    that s it 
phil is  he s so excited 
i thought it might be a good
idea for us to get acquainted 
so i wanted
to introduce myself  and  
whoa  whoops 
phil 
sorry  i didn t know
anyone was here 
phil  this is kat s mother 
mrs  connors 
hey 
she just  uh  came by
to say hello 
uh  okay 
well  i m just gonna
head to my room 
he s a nice boy 
you can rest assured  eve 
that my phil
will take good care
of your daughter 
he s rented a tux 
and everything 
yes 
i m taking kat to the mall
this afternoon to buy
a new dress 
if your mother
 was so unhappy 
why do you think she married
your father in the first place 
god  i have no idea 
because he was there 
i mean 
 he wanted to marry her 
she had no
 other choice  maybe 
i mean  she went to college 
 and she was working
 as a receptionist 
but what else was
she gonna do 
i guess life with my father
must have been pretty bleak
and miserable for her 
the night before she left
i noticed that she started
dressing different 
what do you mean 
different 
like  her clothes
got tighter  sexier 
i mean  she even bought
a miniskirt 
then there was that night that
she walked in on me and phil 
i think it s time
for phil to go home 
  what  why 
  it s late 
it s not even midnight 
kat  what i say goes 
and i say go to bed 
the weirdest part was thatshe had on this nightgown that
 was practically see through 
it was almost like
 she was putting on a show 
could it be that s
what she was doing 
what  putting on a show 
for me  or for phil 
no 
i think she was just bored 
and getting older  and trying
to get whatever attention
she could 
it was almost like
she wanted to have
an affair or something 
do you think that s
what was going on 
no  i mean 
i can t imagine it 
but  i guess anything s
possible  right 
oh  sorry 
i tried knocking
but there was no answer 
that s all right  could i help
you with something 
i m just looking
for my mom s stupid cat

oh  okay  sorry to
bother you  mrs  connors

i just thought that it might be 
like  relative to the case 
are you nervous 
i guess 
a little 
well  you know you can leave
any time you want  right 
i know 
but  uh  you don t want
to leave  do you 
because you came here
to seduce me 
well  congratulations 
sweetheart  it worked 
i m seduced 
and how old are you 
eighteen 
you re not a virgin 
are you 
no 
so  uh   
   you know what s about
to happen  right 
and are you sure
that s what you want 
because i m not one of your
punk classmates from school 
you know 
i know 
well  you re hot

your tits are perfect 
but you already know that 
don t you

i ve seen a lot
of bad shit 
dead people 
very unhappy about it 
oh yeah 
yeah 
trust me 
you don t wanna know 
try me 
all right 
once there was
this obese man 
some sick fuck had doused him
with gasoline
and lit him on fire 
and by the time
we got to the body 
two days later 
he was still burning 
what 
guy had so much body fat 
he was like
a human candle 
and there s
one thing i ve learned 
in all my years as a cop 
it s that people are capable
of doing horrible 
unimaginable things
to each other 
love how slippery you are 
feel like i could break you
in half 
i m tougher
than i look 
  oh  yeah 
  oh  yeah 
  wanna try me 
  yes 
oh  my god 
what  it was easy 
what do you mean
it was easy 
i mean i went over there
and i fucked him 
wow  i m impressed 
truly  truly impressed 
so was it hot 
oh  hell yes 
like  so much better than phil 
deets  girl  deets 
he s just  like  so manly 
like  cock  and balls 
and  like  hairy chest 
and muscles  and 
like  the way he smells 
beth  is so intense 
it s  like  primal 
oh  i can still
smell him on me now 
i mma have me some 
oh  god  that s so hot 
one day i hope some musky macho
stud will fuck the shit out
of me too 
  oh  it ll happen 
  oh  yeah  when  when 
i m so proud of you 
why  because i fucked
an old guy 
yeah 
i mean  don t take this
the wrong way  kat 
but for the longest time
you were acting like
you were still fat 
oh my god 
what are you talking about 
i mean  you lost all
of that weight  like 
what  three years ago 
but you re still skulking
around all angsty and awkward 
like a fat chick  like me 
and mickey  who s basically
a fat chick in a skinny
gay body 
  you re crazy 
  it s true 
mr connor  this is sheryl from thenloma linda police department

detector test

think he knows something 
my dad  beth

if the waiter comes 
you know what i want 
right  okay 
so  uh  are you
all right with this 
what  you mean may 
yeah  dad i like her 
she seems sweet 
i just don t want it
to be awkward for you 
dad  i told you i am thrilled
that you met someone 
seriously 
you deserve to be happy 
took off your
wedding ring 
it makes may
uncomfortable 
i put it back on
when she s not around 
why bother 
i mean  mom left us 
she s the one who made
that choice  i accept that now 
it s about time
we get on with our lives 
mom 
kat 
what is it  what s wrong 
i put my hands in the water 
and they disappeared 
what 
i was doing the dishes
and the water was so cold 
there was a spoon
at the bottom of the sink 
and when i lifted
my hands out of the water   
what s the matter 
um  nothing 
just have strange
dreams sometimes 
oh yeah 
yeah 
they started
after my mother disappeared 
used to get them all the time 
it s actually the first one
i ve had in weeks 
hardly ever talk
about your mother 
there s not much to say 
she s gone 
the shrink says
dreams are meaningless 
i don t think
i agree with that 
what do you think
my dreams mean 
you really want my opinion 
of course 
why wouldn t i 
as you know 
we did an exhaustive search
for your mother 
exhaustive  you guys barely
even looked for her 
actually  a very thorough
investigation was done 
we spent over two years
looking for your mom 
not a single trace
was ever found 
mm hm  whatever 
so where do you
think she is 
i think she s dead 
what 
well  you said yourself
she was having an affair 
which we confirmed 
with your neighbor 
mrs  blangman 
mrs  hillman 
whatever  she said your mom
had a boyfriend 
how would she know 
she s nosy 
she can t see 
wait    whatever  even if
my mom did have a boyfriend 
doesn t it just make it
that much more likely that
she just ran off somewhere 
  what 
  ah   
what  what is it 
what aren t you saying 
we did a thorough background
check on your father 
several interviewees told us
that he was a pretty jealous
and volatile man 
my dad is a fucking wimp 
that s why he used
to drive my mom crazy 
not according to bob
and margie carlsen 
  who are they 
  your former neighbors 
your parents used to live next
door to them in riverside 
they told us that when your
father suspected your mother
had a thing
for bob carlsen 
he lit a trash can on fire
and he tossed it
onto their patio 
that s ridiculous 
never even heard
of these people 
and that was two decades ago 
fine  if my dad was so
dangerous  then why didn t
you ever arrest him 
no evidence 
we didn t even have sufficient
cause for a search warrant 
asked for my professional
opinion  and i told you 
kat  that s just
what i think 
which is 
i think you father caught
your mother fucking her
boyfriend and he killed her 
well then what
did he do with the body 
that s a damn mystery 
kat  come on 
where are you going 
you know what i think 
detective 
i think you re
full of shit 
come on  strong man 
you can do better than that 
what  like this 
no  harder 
put those muscles to good used
for a change  that s better 
that s it  come on 
give it a whack 
you re already here 
uh  yeah  i was just helping
your mom with dinner 
unlike some people 
hi  mrs  hillman  it s kat 
i m sorry  were you in bed 
oh  oh no  i   
i was just lying down 
i    i haven t been
feeling well 
oh  well  i m sorry to bother
you  but  uh  is phil here 
no  he isn t 
  do you know where he is 
  i m afraid not 
that boy sometimes goes out
gallivanting
 til all hours of the night 
okay  well  could you please
tell him to call me as soon
as he gets home 
  it s kind of important 
  uh    of course 
thank you  sorry again
for bothering you 
oh  it s    it s no problem 
goodnight  dear 
good night 
i don t think it s right
with her here 
but if kat says she s
comfortable  i don t  
i don t care
what kat said 
dad

i should probably board 
see you 
goodbye  sweetheart 
that was the last
time i saw my father 
it turns out beth  mickey
 and theo were right 
a few weeks after i left 
 my dad got shitfaced drunk
 in a bar 
and confessed
to killing my mother 
he hung himselfnin his jail cell with a sheet 
before he died  he revealed
 that my mother s body was
 in the freezer 
and that he d taken it
 out during the night while
 i was sleeping 
he buried her up in
 the mountains  since it d
 been frozen for so long 
her corpse decomposed
 freakishly fast 
turning to liquid
as it melted 
by the time they dug her up 
 there was basically
nothing left 
i was seventeen
 when my mother disappeared 
like  one day she was there 
 cleaning  making dinner 
and the next   
she was gone 
stop it 
evie  stop 
evie 
stop 
please 
evie 
stop 
stop 
i love you 
i love you 
because i never saw
 my mother again 
she remains
 in absence to me 
an empty space 
an invisible 
half remembered ghost 
so even now i catch
 myself thinking
that i m gonna run
 into her some day 
like i ll be at a stop light 
 and look over at the car
 next to me
and there she ll be 
 scowling at me with
 disapproval 
or i ll spot her across
 some crowded street 
 or train station 
and we ll run toward
 each other like one
 of those cheesy tv movies 
she ll hug me
 like a long  lost lover 
then take my face
 in her long
