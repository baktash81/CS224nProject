i came home
and she wasnt here
shes probably
at the store or something
her car is in the garage
oh my god stop being so
melodramatic shell turn up
i called everyone
nobodys seen her
dad dont worry
im sure everythings fine
yeah
im going to my room
yeah it was weird she didnt
leave a note or anything
and dad is totally
freaking out
where do you think she is
maybe she finally left him
shes been threatening to
for all these years
well was she like
acting weird or something
no weirder than usual
actually no last week
i came home from school
and i found her sleeping
in my bed
what
yeah random right
when she woke up
she seemed like
all confused and out of it
i think she was still
half in a dream
so anyways where the hell
were you today
oh yeah
sorry i i was hanging out
at thomas and
and you were stoned
uh maybe
you want me to come over
i dont know i kind of have
a lot of homework to do
since when do you give
a shit about homework
my moms been on my case
lately about my grades
phil we havent had sex in
like over a week
i miss fucking you
same here babe
but you know what they say
absence makes
the heart get stronger
yeah
phil are you in there
im on the phone
could you come out here
for a minute honey
i heard a strange
noise outside
youre always hearing
strange noises
yeah ill be out
in a sec
i gotta go my crazy mom
is imagining things again
hmmkay
talk to you later
okay
so no word
you think we should
call the police
i dont want them
coming here for all
the neighbors to see
your mother
wouldnt like it
if we dont hear
anything by morning
lets take a drive
down to the station
mom
mom
mom
mom what happened
when i was little
my mother tried
to curl my hair
oh well we tried
it looks a little fuller
i suppose
she named me katrina so
that she could call me kat
because she always
wanted a pet
come here kat purr for me
kitty come on purr
purr purr purr
thats it
good good little kitty
for years
i thought i was her pet
kat kat
mama
im here kat im here
no more for you god youre
getting fatter by the hour
my mother always wanted me
to be a sylph all lithe
and elegant like her
and when i hit puberty my body
changed seemingly overnight
the bulk melting off like
i was a snowman in the sun
only instead of finally
pleasing her
that somehow made her
resent me even more
do you love the boy
god jesus you scared me
how long have you been
standing there
sorry i didnt mean
to startle you
well are you going
to answer my question
what question
that boy next door
do you love him
what are you talking about
its none of your business
i dont love your father
i cant stand him
as a matter of fact
what the fuck why would
you say that to me go fuckin
tell it to someone else
so no note huh
no nothing
you say she
didnt pack a bag
well nothing seems to be
missing as far as i can tell
the detective was the
polar opposite of men like
my father and phil
he was the kind of man whoncarried a gun got into fights
killed things
with his bare hands
was she depressed was she
on any kind of medication
or taking anything
she didnt kill herself
if thats what youre
trying to imply
well
the good news is
that theres no matches
at any of the hospitals
or morgue
no evidence of foul play
however and i hate to be
the one to tell you this
hundreds of wives
go missing every week
if a woman wants to vanish
buddy she can
are you saying theres
nothing we can do
oh sure there is
i recommend you alert
your friends your neighbors
tell them to be
on the lookout
keep an eye on your bank
account your credit cards
for any kind of activity
got an answering machine
mmhm
good keep it on your wife
might try to contact you
feel free to call me
if anything comes up
dad
your mother never loved me
i didnt know what to say
because i couldnt remember
my mother
ever looking at my dad
with anything but contempt
maybe a zillion eons ago
when they were young
it was different
its perfect right
its everything
ive ever wanted
she was tall
stunning
like a movie star
they were thenquintessential american couple
the future unfurling before
them like some endless
magic carpet
if homemaking was an art
or science my mother would
have won a nobel prize
but once the house
is immaculate and
everything was in its place
she had nothing left to do
but plan the emptiness
of days to come
and gradually the beautiful
woman she once was
became no more than a phantomnwandering away in a snowstorm
hello sweetheart
whats for dinner
meatloaf
oh yum
your meatloaf
is the cats meow
so anyway do you remember
that ticket i bought
at the office raffle
not really
well guess what i won
its a crock pot
we dont need a crock pot
what are you talking about
these are the latest thing
everyones getting one
you can make uh stews
pot roast chili
well i dont have time
to fuss with it now
i have to finish dinner
just put it out of the way over
there on top of the fridge
he was her doormat
she treated him like shit
and he let her
so imagine my shock
when i visited my father
at work one day
and discovered he had game
every woman there was into him
flirting with him batting
their eyelashes
good morning mr connors
and who is this pretty
young lady
good morning mindy this is
kat the new receptionist
i was stunned
these women actually
thought my dad was hot
but to my mother
he would always be pathetic
a constant reminder
of the unbearable repetition
and dullness of her life
my parents marriage was like
a long drink of water from
a frozen fountain
so cold it turns your teeth
to diamonds
it was hardly a surprisento learn their sex life sucked
meanwhile my father had
his own drawer of secrets
so they just went on
like that
my mom never coming my dad
jacking off in the basement
all the while pretending
everythingwas fine
that we were the perfect
family living this
perfect fucking life
pass the butter
thank you
there were times when
i thought she was going mad
that she was going
to suffocate my father
one night with a pillow
that she was going to burn
the fucking house down
but instead she vanished
how does that
make you feel
i dont know
you dont know
do you miss her
no not really
my dad made me see
a shrink because he thought
i needed to process my feelings
about my mother leaving
thing is
i didnt have any feelings
dr thaler reminds me of an
actress playing a therapist
and when we have a session
i feel like an actress
playing myself
i i act i have been having
kind of weird dreams lately
a bad actress
doing a shitty job
like im um im driving
through this gnarly
snow storm
and i cant see anything
i mean theres snow
everywhere
and then out of nowhere
this figure appears
i cant like make it out
in any detail or anything
but i just somehow know
that its my mother
and i try to swerve but i can
feel the car hit something
i get out
and i look all around
but theres no body nothing
just snow and blinding
whiteness everywhere
i ive been having these
dreams ever since my mom left
thats not unusual
especially given the trauma
of your situation
however contrary to popular
belief dreams dont necessarily
mean anything
we all have strange dreams
but in most cases
its just your brains way
of letting off steam
at the end of the day
oh
im worried
about you kat
what do you mean
this is too much
to deal with on your own
is that shrink
youre seeing helping any
i guess ive only been
a couple of times
yeah well my mom said
therapy helped her a lot
after my dad left
i still dont understand
how she could do this to you
she wanted out i guess
so thats no excuse
least my dad told us
he was leaving
he didnt just leave us
in the dark wondering
whatever can we just
stop talking and fuck
gotta get back
before my mom freaks out
plus isnt your dad
coming home soon
no not for
at least an hour
yeah well last thing i want
is for him to catch us again
last time he got so mad i
thought he was gonna kill me
just give your shrink
a chance will you
all right
seriously you need to
let some of your anger out
youre gonna crack
just like your mom
its like a vicious circus
catch you later
i dont mean to sound crass
but if i dont get some dick
soon im going to explode
join the fucking club
sister
look on the bright side
at least youve had real sex
im so paranoid about aids
i have to live vicariously
through you
okay well the problem is that
once youve had real sex
its like all
you can ever think about
and phil barely even touches me
anymore he like gives me
goodnight peck and thats it
what thats fucked up
i know its like
were some old married couple
maybe you should bang that hot
detective youre so into
what what are you talking
about hes like 40
thats not even legal
i dont think
kat hes a cop if anyone knows
how to do shit without getting
caught he does
yeah plus youll be 18
in a few weeks anyway
okay whatever  i am
not screwing a 40 year old cop
okay
back to the problem at hand getting phil to fuck me
well have you talked
to him about it
i tried all he says is that
uh hes got a lot on his mind
and that i need
to cut him some slacks
oh my god
what a fucking moron
i know i know phils not the
brightest crayon in the box
that is the understatement
of the century
thats what i kind of like
about him you know
its just simple
i know that sounds perverse
but hes kind of like my dad
in that way
you can scratch the surface
and theres just more surface
im gonna get straight cs
show me
my god
youre so fuckin crazy
phil is literally
the boy next door
and when he and his
mother moved in last year
i instantly despised him
he was so dull
and stupid
i made fun of him even earned
a special nickname garbage
but then one night that
summer everything changed
me beth and mickey
we were doing what we did
every wednesday
and even more bored
than usual
sometimes i wish someone would
burn this place to the ground
so we didnt have
to come here anymore
oh tell me about it
every week its the same
fucking people with
the same fucking songs
in the exact same
fucking order
oh my god
what
look what the bats
dragged in
what the hell
is garbage doing here
oh shit
hes coming over here
what a fucking freak
guys be cool come on
hey
hey

the street from me

good afternoon mrs hillman

i just thought we should
have a little chat
oh please sit

and please call me eve
so
what can i help
you with eve
well it seems my daughter kat
and your son are dating
yeah i know theyre going to
some big fancy dance next week
fall formal
ah the
thats thats it
phil is hes so excited
i thought it might be a good
idea for us to get acquainted
so i wanted
to introduce myself and
whoa whoops
phil
sorry i didnt know
anyone was here
phil this is kats mother
mrs connors
hey
she just uh came by
to say hello
uh okay
well im just gonna
head to my room
hes a nice boy
you can rest assured eve
that my phil
will take good care
of your daughter
hes rented a tux
and everything
yes
im taking kat to the mall
this afternoon to buy
a new dress
if your mother
was so unhappy
why do you think she married
your father in the first place
god i have no idea
because he was there
i mean
he wanted to marry her
she had no
other choice maybe
i mean she went to college
and she was working
as a receptionist
but what else was
she gonna do
i guess life with my father
must have been pretty bleak
and miserable for her
the night before she left
i noticed that she started
dressing different
what do you mean
different
like her clothes
got tighter sexier
i mean she even bought
a miniskirt
then there was that night that
she walked in on me and phil
i think its time
for phil to go home
what why
its late
its not even midnight
kat what i say goes
and i say go to bed
the weirdest part was thatshe had on this nightgown that
was practically seethrough
it was almost like
she was putting on a show
could it be thats
what she was doing
what putting on a show
for me or for phil
no
i think she was just bored
and getting older and trying
to get whatever attention
she could
it was almost like
she wanted to have
an affair or something
do you think thats
what was going on
no i mean
i cant imagine it
but i guess anythings
possible right
oh sorry
i tried knocking
but there was no answer
thats all right could i help
you with something
im just looking
for my moms stupid cat

this obese man
some sick fuck had doused him
with gasoline
and lit him on fire
and by the time
we got to the body
two days later
he was still burning
what
guy had so much body fat
he was like
a human candle
and theres
one thing ive learned
in all my years as a cop
its that people are capable
of doing horrible
unimaginable things
to each other
love how slippery you are
feel like i could break you
in half
im tougher
than i look
oh yeah
oh yeah

in town katrina
oh just a week then its back
to the salt mines
kat got almost all
as her first semester
wow congratulations
yeah i lucked out have you
guys ordered yet im starved
your favorite the spinach
artichoke appetizer its
already on its way
oh yes
im going to make a quick trip
to the ladies room
if the waiter comes
you know what i want
right okay
so uh are you
all right with this
what you mean may
yeah dad i like her
she seems sweet
i just dont want it
to be awkward for you
dad i told you i am thrilled
that you met someone
seriously
you deserve to be happy
took off your
wedding ring
it makes may
uncomfortable
i put it back on
when shes not around
why bother
i mean mom left us
shes the one who made
that choice i accept that now
its about time
we get on with our lives
mom
kat
what is it whats wrong
i put my hands in the water
and they disappeared
what
i was doing the dishes
and the water was so cold
there was a spoon
at the bottom of the sink
and when i lifted
my hands out of the water
whats the matter
um nothing
just have strange
dreams sometimes
oh yeah
yeah
they started
after my mother disappeared
used to get them all the time
its actually the first one
ive had in weeks
hardly ever talk
about your mother
theres not much to say
shes gone
the shrink says
dreams are meaningless
i dont think
i agree with that
what do you think
my dreams mean
you really want my opinion
of course
why wouldnt i
as you know
we did an exhaustive search
for your mother
exhaustive you guys barely
even looked for her
actually a very thorough
investigation was done
we spent over two years
looking for your mom
not a single trace
was ever found
mmhm whatever
so where do you
think she is
i think shes dead
what
well you said yourself
she was having an affair
which we confirmed
with your neighbor
mrs blangman
mrs hillman
whatever she said your mom
had a boyfriend
how would she know
shes nosy
she cant see
wait whatever even if
my mom did have a boyfriend
doesnt it just make it
that much more likely that
she just ran off somewhere
what
ah
what what is it
what arent you saying
we did a thorough background
check on your father
several interviewees told us
that he was a pretty jealous
and volatile man
my dad is a fucking wimp
thats why he used
to drive my mom crazy
not according to bob
and margie carlsen
who are they
your former neighbors
your parents used to live next
door to them in riverside
they told us that when your
father suspected your mother
had a thing
for bob carlsen
he lit a trash can on fire
and he tossed it
onto their patio
thats ridiculous
never even heard
of these people
and that was two decades ago
fine if my dad was so
dangerous then why didnt
you ever arrest him
no evidence
we didnt even have sufficient
cause for a search warrant
asked for my professional
opinion and i told you
kat thats just
what i think
which is
i think you father caught
your mother fucking her
boyfriend and he killed her
well then what
did he do with the body
thats a damn mystery
kat come on
where are you going
you know what i think
detective
i think youre
full of shit
come on strong man
you can do better than that
what like this
no harder
put those muscles to good used
for a change thats better
thats it come on
give it a whack
youre already here
uh yeah i was just helping
your mom with dinner

goodbye sweetheart
that was the last
time i saw my father
it turns out beth mickey
and theo were right
a few weeks after i left
my dad got shitfaced drunk
in a bar
and confessed
to killing my mother
he hung himselfnin his jail cell with a sheet
before he died he revealed
that my mothers body was
in the freezer
and that hed taken it
out during the night while
i was sleeping
he buried her up in
the mountains since itd
been frozen for so long
her corpse decomposed
freakishly fast
turning to liquid
as it melted
by the time they dug her up
there was basically
nothing left
i was seventeen
when my mother disappeared
like one day she was there
cleaning making dinner
and the next
she was gone
stop it
evie stop
evie
stop
please
evie
stop
stop
i love you
i love you
because i never saw
my mother again
she remains
in absence to me
an empty space
an invisible
half remembered ghost
so even now i catch
myself thinking
that im gonna run
into her some day
like ill be at a stop light
and look over at the car
next to me
and there shell be
scowling at me with
disapproval
or ill spot her across
some crowded street
or train station
and well run toward
each other like one
of those cheesy tv movies
shell hug me
like a long lost lover
then take my face
in her long
