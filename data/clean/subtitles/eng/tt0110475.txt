youd like to see him again
i wouldnt mind
i know him you know

meet me tonight
maybe i could work something out
how about at landfill park
sunset
perfect
super
thanks stanley
you really are a nice guy
this is an interesting place
looks like fourth
or fifthcentury scandinavian
possibly a representation of one
of the norse night gods maybe loki
loki
who is loki
the norse god of mischief
supposedly he caused such trouble that
odin banished him from valhalla forever
then he could have banished him
into that mask
im talking about mythology
mr ipkiss
this is a piece of wood
but your book
my book is about
masks as a metaphor
a metaphornot to be taken literally
you suffer from a mild delusion
alright
ill prove it to you
but i am not responsible
for the consequences
just sit back and enjoy the ride
mr expert
you dont scare me
go right ahead
see you
you said loki was a night god
maybe it works at night
i should warn you that i dont work
personally with really sick people
there are private institutions
for those things
i can arrange for a safe environment
for you tonight if you want
i must see tina
but what can i do
do i go as myself
or the mask
if i tell you you promise
to leave my office right now
go as yourself
and as the mask
because they are both
one and the same beautiful person
got the crosscheck on
the fingerprints its ipkiss
