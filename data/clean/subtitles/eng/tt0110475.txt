who crosses me 
we have a crisis here and you
stroll in an hour late 
if i must put up with  
back off  monkey boy

thanks for everything 
you d like to see him again 
i wouldn t mind 
i know him  you know

meet me tonight 
maybe i could work something out 
  how about at landfill park 
  sunset 
  perfect 
  super 
thanks  stanley 
you really are a nice guy 
this is an interesting place 
looks like fourth 
or fifth century scandinavian 
possibly a representation of one
of the norse night gods  maybe loki 
loki 
who is loki 
the norse god of mischief 
supposedly he caused such trouble that
odin banished him from valhalla forever 
then he could have banished him
into that mask 
i m talking about mythology 
mr  ipkiss 
this is a piece of wood 
but your book    
my book is about
masks as a metaphor 
a metaphor not to be taken literally 
you suffer from a mild delusion 
alright 
i ll prove it to you 
but i am not responsible
for the consequences 
just sit back and enjoy the ride 
mr  expert 
you don t scare me 
go right ahead 
see you 
you said loki was a night god 
maybe it works at night 
i should warn you that i don t work
personally with really sick people 
there are private institutions
for those things 
i can arrange for a safe environment
for you tonight  if you want 
i must see tina 
but what can i do 
do i go as myself   
or the mask 
if i tell you  you promise
to leave my office right now 
go as yourself   
and as the mask 
because they are both
one and the same beautiful person 
got the cross check on
the fingerprints  it s ipkiss 
i m looking at him 
keep the swat team standing by 
if he s half as bad as they say 
we ll have a full dance card 
pickle relish 
  get in the car 
  but i ordered onion rings 
landfill park
what are you doing here 
i wanted to make sure that you
2 got together all right 
that s nice 
i hardly ever stop by here 
it s hard to believe it was   
a garbage heap 
it s really beautiful
right around sunset 
the methane emissions
really pick up the colors 
all those   
pinks and greens 
my friend will be along here
any minute  i better go
