a handsome sight   
   the pride of the third reich 
the brave sergeant taking
coffee to the beachgunners 
so that s a sample of the
master race  in a pig s eye 
in this darkest hour  in
the gloom of night   
   we must not despair 
for each of us   
   deliverance is coming 
we need mines and obstacles
along the whole coast 
at every beach  on every dune   
   on every rock 
how many have been installed 
four million  herr field marshal 
the work has completely
exhausted our troops 
which would your troops rather be   
   exhausted or dead 
just look at it  gentlemen 
how calm    how peaceful it is 
a strip of water between
england and the continent   
   between the allies and us 
but beyond that peaceful
horizon    a monster waits 
a coiled spring of men 
ships and planes   
   straining to be released against us 
but not a single allied soldier
shall reach the shore 
whenever or wherever this invasion
may come  gentlemen   
   i shall destroy the enemy
there    at the water s edge 
believe me  gentlemen 
the first 24 hours of the
invasion will be decisive 
for the allies as well as the germans 
it will be the longest day   
   the longest day 
the poem by verlaine 
play it back 
frenchmen speaking to their countrymen 
here are some personal messages 
 the long sobs of the violins of autumn   
i repeat 
 the long sobs of the violins of autumn   
have you notified all commands 
if berlin is right 
when we intercept the second verse   
   it will mean the invasion
will come within 24 hours 
give me the text of the second verse 
 wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor   
we ve intercepted hundreds of messages
in the last year    hundreds 
i ve ordered alerts again and again 
why should this poem mean more
than other messages 
tell me this 
does it give us any clue as to
where they will land and when 
of course it doesn t 
how can i maintain discipline if
i keep my troops on the alert   
   just because a pair of nitwits
in berlin intercept a poem 
no  blumentritt    no alert 
and especially not in this weather 
  anything else 
  no  sir 
good morning  field marshal 
  any news 
  nothing important 
fighter bombers hit the pas de 
calais yesterday afternoon 
nothing much happened
last night    the storm 
that s all i m interested in
this morning    the storm 
it came from nowhere   
blew my roses to bits 
there are five foot waves
in the channel   
   and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour 
for the month of june   
   it s the worst channel
storm in 20 years 
my appointment at berchtesgaden 
general jodl will see the führer today   
   and confirm the appointment for you 
will you still go to germany as planned 
can you think of a better time 
the weather is expected to continue
like this for another week 
snap it up  jerk the lead 
snap it up 
jerk the lead 
snap it up 
jerk the lead 
you expect us to eat this slop again 
i don t care what you do with it  mac 
eat it  throw it out

come on  put it on 
snap it up 
jerk the lead 
didn t you get any sleep

since we got here 
i got the absolute lowdown 
it s on for tonight  for sure

  move it  move it 
hey  hutchy 
hutchy  i want to ask you something 
hey  hutchinson   
   do you think they d let me write
home  if it was really important 
not likely  mate  security 
i don t think old churchill trusts us 
it s the wife  you see 
she s going to have a baby 
your first  is it 
oh  it s not mine  but i m dead
worried about her 
she s not too strong  you see 
man  that stink 
diesel oil  backed up toilets  vomit 
and there ain t no place left
to get sick in 
the puke bags is full 
the fire buckets is full 
all we got left is our helmets 
june 
every june my old man
used to take me camping   
   up in the blue mountains 
we d hunt and fish all day long 
and at night   
   we d sleep out under the stars 
didn t even need a blanket 
june 
wind and rain  wind and rain 
don t it ever stop 
look  dad  all i want
to do is get going 
wind or no wind  even if we land
in paris on the eiffel tower 
  come to think of it   
  colonel wants us 
all of us 
all troops will participate
in ground tactics and deployment 
in this weather  sir 
of course  harding  if you can ensure
that we ll land in france   
   in sunshine and dry weather 
  didn t mean that 
  what did you mean 
  it isn t the weather 
it s the waiting 
these men are itching to go 
i don t think i have to remind you   
   that this war has been going on
for almost five years 
half of europe has been
overrun and occupied 
we re comparative newcomers 
england s gone through a blitz with
a knife at her throat since 1940 
i am quite sure that they too
are impatient and itching to go 
do i make myself clear 
yes  sir  quite clear 
three million men penned up
on this island 
all over england 
in staging areas like this 
we re on the threshold
of the most crucial day of our times 
three million men out there   
   keyed up  and waiting for
that big step off 
they aren t exactly alone 
notify the men  full packs
and equipment  14 00 hours 
yes  sir 
this allows you more freedom 
quicker to get rid of
when we hit the beach 
  well 
  it s on 
tonight  as scheduled 
  providing the weather isn t worse 
  how worse can it get 
ike has called a high level
conference for 9 30 
i am not eisenhower  i am
an assistant division commander 
i don t know from nothing 
but he can t call it off again 
frank  turn that thing off 
four thousand ships loaded for bear 
troops ready to go 
eleven thousand planes on the line 
eighteen thousand paratroopers 
god only knows how many gliders 
norm  relax 
raf says the gale can stop
as suddenly as it began 
so they told us yesterday
and the day before 
look  norm 
we re all of us just as   
   dedicated to this thing as you are 
just as anxious to get going 
and that includes ike 
now if he calls it off again 
he knows what he s doing 
of course he does  i know that 
i m just thinking about those
assault troops  200 000 of them   
   out there on those ships

some of those men have been
on those tubs for almost three days 
i say go

   of the channel 
you mean   
   he s bought it 
ack ack over calais 
he jumped clean 
but his parachute didn t open 
that leaves just you
in the squadron  dave 
i mean  of the old 1940 mob 
what s always worried me
about being one of the few   
   is the way we keep on
getting fewer 
yeah 
poor old johnny 
bad luck  it happening now 
  now  then  what s the difference 
  he went through the battle of britain 
and now if the big show
starts tonight   
   he won t be in it 
look  will you please
shut up about him 
all right  all right 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
you heard something about tonight 
no  no  i haven t heard anything 
  what are you talking about then 
  well  it s just   
  go on  go on 
  i have a feeling it s on for tonight 
  that s all 
  a feeling 
take your feeling somewhere else 
i ve got a letter to write 
i ve had this feeling since i woke up 
i ve had it with me all day long 
i can t shake it off 
it s tonight  i know it is 
all right  it s tonight 
suits me fine 
tonight  this afternoon  now 
i mean   
   as soon as i finish this beer 
  general  can you spare me a minute 
  come in 
  thank you 
  can i get you coffee 
  no  thanks 
  i ll get some for myself 
is it still raining 
on and off  off and on 
sometimes i wonder
which side god s on 
what 
i say  sometimes i wonder
which side god s on 
good question 
what s on your mind  van 
i m concerned about the placement
of our drop zones 
go on 
i know this is a hell of a late date
to bring up something new   
   but you ve given me
a tough nut to crack 
  it gets tougher every time i try 
  i know  van 
sainte mère eglise straddles
the only road the germans can use   
   to drive into our northern flank 
but it has to be taken 
and it has to be held 
that s why i gave you the job  van 
  can i use your board 
  of course 
here s the town  heavily fortified 
down here is the swamp area
that the germans have flooded 
and in between  four miles
from the town  is our drop zone 
now if anything goes wrong
and we undershoot   
   we land in this flooded area
and are bogged down 
if we overshoot  we come down
like clay pigeons   
   smack dab in the center
of sainte mère eglise 
that s why i gave the men training
in low level jumps near the villages 
so i ve heard 
got a complaint from
the city council at bexhall 
some of your men overshot
the drop zone and landed in the town 
  tied up traffic for an hour 
  that s true  sir  i was with them 
sudden crosswind hit us 
swept us over the treetops   
   scattered us all over the place 
  where did you end up 
  in the courtyard of a convent 
relax  van  sit down 
the last few months have been
a tough grind on all of us 
i hear you ve been working yourself
and your battalion hard 
almost without a stop 
now that we re almost
at the end of the line   
   why don t you try easing up
on yourself and on the men 
sometimes a battalion can be
sharpened to too fine a point 
sometimes a commander can too 
well   
   if there s any further delay   
   i request permission to submit
a new placement for our drop zones 
all right  put it in writing 
make it official 
that s your prerogative 
but ike has called a final meeting
for tonight at southwick house 
if it s on  we ll get
the green light by 9 30 
  what are the chances 
  better than 50 50 
forget everything i said  i got
the best battalion in this division   
   and they re ready 
here it is  the latest report 
  it s southwick house  sir 
  stagg here 
yes  sir  the new front s moving in
much faster than we thought 
yes  sir  it s definitely improving 
i ll be there  sir  9 30 
  would you like some more tea  sir 
  coffee  and make it black 
please 
one moment  colonel priller 
why wasn t he court martialed 
he shot down 132 planes 
don t call me  pips  old boy   
you were a rotten pilot
when we flew in russia 
you re flying a desk now  but
you re still a rotten pilot 
what s that you re saying 
i m squatting here on this
god forsaken airfield   
   with only two planes   
two stinking crates 
oh  sure  sure    your
orders were followed 
now my squadrons are god knows where 
my supplies are all gone  what
am i supposed to do now 
but pips  we had to disperse our
fighter squadrons    we had to 
look what happened to our airstrips
around the pas de calais 
the whole idea is absolutely idiotic 
you move us back instead of forward 
sure  i know the weather s lousy
and they probably won t invade   
   but what would happen if they did 
but you know i can t get there
with my equipment for two days 
i tell you  you re all crazy 
priller has always been a hothead   
   but let s not underestimate him 
what he says is not entirely illogical 
what s the weather report 
slightly better over the channel 
i wouldn t be surprised if   
  when s the next weather report 
  tonight at 8  general 
keep me posted on the weather 
you made my dinner reservations 
yes  i did  general 
cancel everything 
shoes for my wife  i had them
specially made in paris   
   for her birthday    tomorrow 
the sixth of june 
please wish her a happy birthday 
thank you  speidel 
why didn t they attack in may 
the weather was perfect   
an attack now would be embarrassing 
but i don t think we need worry 
is the plan ready  sir 
yes  yes  quite finished 
war games   
   theoretical invasions 
rush to rennes just to push
little flags around a table 
playing at war 
do you win or lose  sir 
have i ever lost 
but general  this time you play
the role of eisenhower 
i win because i go against the rules 
we expect them to cross at the
narrowest part of the channel   
   and in good weather  but that s
too simple    too obvious 
i choose the widest part  in the
worst weather    and attack here 
in normandy 
and in bad weather 
like now   
   bad weather 
trying to pick a trend is difficult 
from a meteorological standpoint 
conditions almost resemble mid winter 
and normandy 
high winds  clouds 
and some fog over the beaches 
however  i can say with a certain
degree of safety   
   that we can expect a brief period
of fair conditions 
let me summarize  then 
what you re promising us is a barely
tolerable period of fair conditions 
am i right 
yes 
conditions that are far below
the minimum requirements 
that s all i can promise 
you ve done your best  stagg 
thank you  gentlemen 
well   
   there it is 
we ve postponed the attack
once already 
now  either we go on the 6th 
with only marginal conditions   
   or postpone again   
   in the hope of getting
perfect conditions 
what do you think  monty 
i say  go  go 
i must remind everybody   
   that the american convoy
for the omaha and utah beaches   
   they ve farthest to go   
   must be given the order
within the next half hour   
   if the assault is to take place
on the 6th 
we can t keep almost a quarter
of a million men on ships   
   in embarkation areas  indefinitely 
the longer we wait  the more
acute our security problem 
the next time   
   the tides and the moon
will be right   
not before july 
gentlemen   
   such a postponement   
   is too bitter to contemplate 
a brilliant plan  general 
unorthodox  but brilliant 
fortunately  it s only a game 
i don t think we have
much to worry about 
eisenhower would never
take the gamble 
never 
i m quite positive
we must give the order 
i don t like it   
   but there it is 
gentlemen   
   i don t see how we can possibly
do anything else but go 
wilson speaking 
yes  sir 
it s on  sir  ike s made the
decision  tonight  as scheduled 
colonel tomson speaking 
thank you 
next stop   
   normandy 
god help us now 
gentlemen   
   the day we ve been
waiting for has arrived 
invasion  we re on our way 
general 
the orders have been given 
it s on 
have the battalion commanders
join me in the wardroom 
all right  sergeant 
you men are the eyes
of our airborne army 
you  the pathfinders  will have
one job  and one job only 
to light the drop zones
for our paratroops 
along with the british and canadians
you ll be the first men   
   to land in france 
and remember this 
when you get to normandy   
   you ll only have one friend 
god 
and this 
this   
   is rupert 
now  we are going to drop rupert   
   and a lot more like him   
   behind the invasion area 
he s   
   a very extraordinary
fellow  rupert 
he s sort of a   
   one man army  all by himself 
let me show you 
let me show you what happens
when rupert   
   hits the ground 
sergeant  switch off
the lights  please 
all right  sergeant  that s all 
all right  come on  simmer down 
come on  up 
it s possible that rupert and his men
will do the same thing to the germans 
confuse them  make them look
over their shoulders   
   and launch an attack
in the wrong direction 
ten hut 
  the crickets have been distributed 
  so i heard 
at ease 
you re as ready as we can make you 
this five cent toy   
   wasn t issued to you for laughs 
it may save your life 
you re gonna be landing in the dark 
on the other side of that hedgerow   
   the fellow may not be wearing
the same uniform you are  so   
   one click   
   is to be answered by two clicks 
and if you don t
get that answering click   
   hit the dirt and open fire 
i repeat 
one click   
   must be answered by two clicks 
now  hang on to this gimmick 
it s as important as your weapon 
do you read me 
loud and clear  sir 
all right  one more thing 
your assignment tonight is strategic 
you can t give the enemy a break 
send them to hell 
that is all 
london calling
with messages for our friends 
 molasses tomorrow will
bring forth cognac   
 john has a long mustache   
i repeat 
 john has a long mustache   
 john has a long mustache   
 john has a long mustache   
 john has a long mustache   
no  not yet   
oh  my lord 
 john has a long mustache   
shh 
make any sense to you  mac 
as i said last night  they re code
messages to the resistance chaps 
obviously  one message means
something to one group   
   and another means something
to another group 
 there is a fire at the travel agency   
i repeat 
 there is a fire at the travel agency   
 wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor   
i repeat 
 wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor   
the bridge    in forty five minutes 
we ll be back 
 wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor   
i repeat 
 wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor   
 there is a fire at the travel agency   
the best hand i ve had all night 
let me see here   
pardon me 
pardon me  general    it s come 
wait  give that to me 
what s come 
it s the second part of the message 
the second verse 
 wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor   
 wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor   
we can expect the invasion
within 24 hours 
put the fifteenth army on full alert 
thank you 
you know  i m too old a bunny to
get very excited about all this 
now    where was i    
oh yes  two spades 
it s almost impossible to believe 
every dot represents a ship 
you got battlewagons  cruisers 
destroyers  minesweepers 
you got assault craft of every size
and every type 
the biggest armada
the world s ever known 
here 
you remember it 
remember every bit of it 
we re on the eve of a day   
   that people will talk about
long after we re dead and gone 
you wanna know something 
it gives me goose pimples
just to be part of it 
you could call it one of them   
   crazy  quickie wartime marriages 
you know 
met at a dance at the uso
and all that   
   but  i mean  i took it serious 
and so did she 
we didn t do it just for kicks 
  when did you get the letter 
  week ago 
two weeks 
maybe i was wrong  what i wrote her 
you know  i mean  she s a high class
model and all  and i   
i m not the kind of guy
to get married that easy 
i mean  it wasn t no joke to me 
but oh  man  we really had some
wonderful times together 
and you think she s got a boyfriend 
well  she never actually said so   
i mean   
you think i was right 
i mean  was i fair

release point coming up  major howard 
right  prepare for landing 
cutting loose now 
roger and out 
doing the lambeth walk 
major  i cannot overestimate
the importance of your task 
the orne river bridge must be captured
before the enemy can destroy it 
it s a vital military artery  and the
enemy has prepared it for demolition 
it must be taken by surprise
and captured intact 
your gliders will land at night 
without the benefit of ground support 
you will assault the garrison 
overwhelm it   
   and hold until relieved 
hold until relieved 
major howard 
there s the bridge coming up 
just on our left 
right  link your arms 
brace yourselves 
feet up

  what about the paratroopers 
  7th para might not get here for hours 
and lovat and his commandos   
it could be midday

the question is 
how long can we hold 
hold until relieved 
hold until relieved 
it s raining again 
thank you

gen  schlieben of the 709th has
already left for the war games 
the commander of the 243rd
left for rennes at 18 00 hours 
also  zimmermann of the 352nd   
twelve officers in all 
yes  i know 
the weather is bad  so everyone
enjoys an extra night in rennes 
i don t like it 
any of it 
so many key officers are
away at the same time 
i don t know why  but i don t like it 
but the war games have been
scheduled for a week   
yes  for tomorrow    not tonight 
advise all officers who have
not yet left for rennes   
   to postpone their
departure until tomorrow 
may i remind you  general   
   that the allies have always landed
in perfect weather conditions 
north africa    sicily    italy   
yes  and always at dawn

good luck at the war games  general 
anything important 
communications reports difficulty
in contacting our forward posts 
the underground again 
some sort of rubber dummies have
been dropped by parachute 
rubber dummies 
connect me with general richter 
we can expect commando raids
and other diversionary tactics   
   but i don t like this idea
of dummy parachutists 
are you certain 
how many 
what do you think of it 
paratroopers   
put it over there 
this is what they dropped  they
explode on contact with the earth 
in the dark  they look like soldiers 
perhaps these are what general
richter saw  not real paratroopers 
when you create a diversion 
it s for a reason 
connect me with general pemsel 
dummies     
rubber dummies 
i agree with you  general 
i ll call you back 
what about my call to von rundstedt 
we haven t been able to reach him 
the main lines seem to be cut 
they wouldn t drop dummies   
   unless it was to divert our
attention from something else 
in this weather 
in any kind of weather 
i must get in touch with ob west 
shh 
they re enemy paratroopers 
blimey  mate

i heard two clicks 
man   
   am i glad to see you

  no  this is the 101 
101 
where s the 82nd 
look  bud  we don t even know
where our own outfit is 
well  somebody s shooting at somebody 
let s us go find this war 
come on 
maybe they re limeys
and ain t got no cricket 
they must be our guys 
okay 
no 
hey 
hey  they were germans 
hundreds of planes have been
flying to my left and right 
toward caen 
now over the cherbourg peninsula   
something must be happening 
but what  pluskat  what 
i haven t the faintest idea 
has anything been
observed on the beaches 
no    nothing 
yes  i ll let you know right away 
of course 
are you positive that ankle s broken 
compound fracture  sir 
well  put the boot back on
and lace it up   
   tight 
don t get mad  i didn t break it 
and you re not walking on it 
  you re not going to try   
  knock it off and do as you re told 
yes 
a  b and c company are scattered
all over like we are 
go on 
conklin landed on a stone wall  broke
his shoulder  i left him with a medic 
any contact with f company 
no  but they must be up ahead
in the direction of sainte mère eglise 
ow 
well  go ahead  tie it off 
tie it off 
well  here s where we are 
the northern edge of the swamp area   
   five miles from our drop zone 
five miles 
  f company 
  no  sir 
and we ve got scouts
all over the place 
we even picked up a group
from the 101 
f company were the first
of the lead planes 
well  give me a hand 
can i have my rifle 
well  we ll head out this way 
we ought to reach high ground
and open country by daybreak 
all right  have the men spread out   
   pick up any stragglers
they can find 
  pass the word 
  right  sir 
all right  men  spread out 
pick up stragglers you see 
pass the word down 
all right   
   let s go 
from the latest reports 
this is how i see it 
american paratroopers have landed   
here 
british paratroopers   
here 
the invasion   
here 
yes  thank you  pemsel 
general pemsel is convinced
that this is the invasion 
i do not agree with him 
this is my conclusion 
normandy is the objective
of a diversionary attack 
a diversionary attack  blumentritt 
it s not the main attack  that will
come at the pas de calais   
   where it was always expected 
where we always expected it 
but we can t take any chances 
i want the reserve panzers
moved up at once 
we need approval from the
führer s headquarters 
they wouldn t dare refuse me 
call the führer s headquarters
and insist 
insist that the panzers be
released to me immediately 
an invasion of normandy would
be against all military logic 
it would really be against all logic   
well  that about covers it  gentlemen 
most of you have had
your feet wet before 
dunkirk  dieppe  norway 
and we know what it means
to be driven into the sea 
in a few hours
we re going back from the sea 
and this time we re going to stay 
there s no time
for any sob stuff about   
   england  home and beauty 
remember  our people have had a
rough time for four and a half years 
they ve earned the final victory 
let s give it to them 
and to our french comrades in arms 
i say 
good luck 
tomorrow morning  we ll take them 
oh 
come in  teddy 
did you have to put it in writing 
i knew you wouldn t let me go
unless i did 
you re putting me on the spot 
  i didn t mean to  tubby 
  the hell you didn t 
you put that request in writing 
made it official 
you re the assistant division
commander 
and that s why i m supposed to go
ashore in the first wave 
that s where i m supposed to be 
you know that 
you re important
to this operation 
we can t have you knocked off
on the first day 
but that s not the real reason 
isn t it because my father was
president of the united states 
and a great president 
and a great soldier 
he led the charge of the rough riders
up san juan hill 
so now you ve got to be
the first man ashore on utah beach 
but that s where i m supposed to be 
tubby  that s my job 
also  i ve been there side by side
with the men all through training 
they re used to seeing where i belong 
they have a right to expect me there 
president s son or not 
is my request denied 
no  you know it s not 
request reluctantly approved 
thanks  tubby 
thanks a lot 
say   
   how s that arthritis of yours 
arthritis 
haven t had a touch in months 
glad to hear it 
the street   
   the bridge   
   the hotel   
   the casino 
one more thing   
you have been fighting
everywhere for four years   
   in abyssinia  libya  egypt  crete   
but this time you are going
to fight on french soil   
   in our fields   
   in our villages   
   under the eyes of our own people 
the führer took a sedative  i won t
wake him for these reports 
first we hear that the paratroopers
are shot down plane crews 
next they are identified
as mechanical dummies 
if paratroopers have landed   
   it can only be a commando raid 
is that a sufficient reason to send
the panzers to the coast 
i will submit all reports to the
führer as soon as he awakens 
i understand 
jodl has turned us down 
he will not release the panzers
without the führer s approval   
   and the führer is still asleep 
will you tell von rundstedt 
no  not now   
not now 
thank you  gentlemen 
sit down 
this is history 
we are living an historical moment 
we are going to lose the war   
   because the glorious führer
has taken a sleeping pill   
   and is not to be awakened 
it s unbelievable 
think of it  kurt 
don t ever forget it 
we are witnessing something   
   which historians will always
say is completely improbable   
   and yet it is true 
the führer is not to be awakened 
i sometimes wonder
whose side god is on 
can i   
   bring you anything  sir 
in my room there is a bottle
of excellent cognac   
   napoleon  unopened 
i was even saving it for
a fitting occasion 
this isn t exactly the right
occasion  but get it anyway

what about the reserve panzers 
the führer went into
one of his tantrums   
   and no one dared
bring up the subject 
they re still held in reserve 
yes  field marshal 
sir  if you would call
the führer yourself   
   i am convinced he would
respect your views 
call him 
call that bohemian corporal  
crawl on my knees to him  
no  it is out of the question 
 wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor   
what s that
