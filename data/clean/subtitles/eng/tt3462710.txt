your alleged assailant 
michael vargas 
he was convicted and served
12 months  probation 
i m sorry that happened to you 
they dated for two years 
and you were treated in
a psychiatric hospital after the incident 
that was my choice 
but after the restraining order was up 
you tried to resume contact 
you tell me  ms  banks 
after all this why would you wanna
go back and reunite with mr  vargas 
no 
we downloaded the contents
of mr  vargas  phone 
i have almost 50 pages
of facebook messages
between you and mr  vargas 
these belong to you 
yes 
but you don t understand  i   
the man is dead 
found in your home 
with your face all over his phone
and your delicates found in his car 
now you re gonna have to
help me out here 
that s what we always said
this company was about  right 
taking risks  adventures 
and bringing stories to life 
although she clearly didn t get the memo
that mindset only applies
to adventures we have together 
i could not be more thrilled
for her next chapter 
to julia 
the woman who has brought
so many stories to life
as our chief online editor
  now gets to have a life of her own

but she has no idea how to parent 
lily has a rash now
from some old blanket 
she has no idea what to feed a child 
i had to come over the other day
to get lily to eat and put her to bed 
and lily told me she heard her scream
in the middle of the night 
we re all figuring it out 
come on

i need some time 
time doesn t exist at your age 
david has moved on and so should you 
maybe i ll get a job 
i do have a degree  you know

maybe you should have
thought of that before you   
mother

i tried so hard to
cement things with david 
i told you  having his baby would work 
and lily was living  breathing 
perfect cement 
then you ruined it 
there s no going back 
i just want you to be happy 
i don t want you to be alone 
okay  lovey 
yay 
okay 
you re ready for the runway  i love it 
that s it  chin up  shoulders back

it s nice to see david so happy 
it s also really nice to come over here
and not feel like
i m walking on eggshells 
  that bad  huh 
  mmm hmm 
well  things didn t actually work out
for tess the way she wanted 
in more ways than one 
what do you mean 
well  at first we thought
tessa was amazing 
star at stanford  super charming 
so together 
all the big firms
were recruiting her  too 
but then she changed 
got possessive  turned into gollum
and david was her precious 
oh  wow 
we were thrilled when
david finally broke up with her 
then  turns out she was pregnant 
that s perfect  right 
so  she and her mother 
cruella chanel 
moved with david to new york 
 cause you know david 
he did the right thing 
and then she had to watch him
leave it all behind for the brewery 
bingo 
we go to the brew pub
in san francisco 
walk in  and i just  i just see her
sitting across the restaurant 
talking to her crazy friend   
and    i got it  i got it 
i got it 
okay 
i know what happened 
he bailed on me 
i wouldn t say bail
as left you in charge 
hello

i don t know what came over me
and i just said 
 i m not leaving here until   
 until i meet you  i m sorry  
and  uh    huh  who was it 
ali  i ll call her back later 
oh  see 
crazy friend  ali again 
anyway  uh  i don t know what   
i hope i m not interrupting 
just saw a man leaving 
it was a delivery 
tessa  why are you here 
at our house 
david s jury summons came to me 
he did live there for years 
it s not always all about you  julia 
if you re going to be a parent 
especially to my daughter 
i d like you to learn that lesson  fast 
you re sure they re not
from david connover 
and what do you mean there s no record
of who sent the arrangement 
how is that possible 
the order was done anonymously 
i m not sure where it s coming from 
  okay 
  sorry about that 
  thank you 
  have a nice day 
jules  we re home 
hi  julia 
no  go to sleep 
well  maybe it s because
the restraining order is up
and i can t renew it 
but i just feel like it s him
making these calls 
take a deep breath  all right 
no one knows where you live 
you re not on facebook or twitter 
you basically don t exist 
and this has happened before 
remember when we were up in big sur
and you thought he was following us
in that truck 
  yeah  but   
  or you thought you saw him at the window 
but it was really just david 
you re right 
you still haven t told david
what happened to you  huh 
it s gonna be
really hard to tell him  ali 
really hard 
i don t want him to see me like that 
i don t want it to change anything 
hey  what about calling that doctor
that you liked so much at the meadows 
no 
i m okay 
he ll love me no matter what  right 
there is nothing not to love 
i love you and i don t even like people 
jules 
i gotta go 
i love you  too 
hey 
hey 
sorry  i just couldn t sleep 
well  is everything okay 
yeah

  okay 
  and i love these earrings  use these 
  these are nice 
  thank you 
look  i think you got
the whole look  you ll be fine 
  i think so 
  i wouldn t  uh   
hi  julia 
hi  tessa 
i ll see you 
just finished a board meeting
at lily s school 
i m never quite sure what to do
with the alone time 
yeah  these days  me  too 
  listen  julia  i   
  no  about yesterday   
no  no  i came by unannounced  it was   
no  i shouldn t have talked
to you like that 
i know i can come on a bit strong 
no 
i m sorry 
i shouldn t have snapped at you 
forgiven  it happens 
thanks  tessa 
can i buy you lunch 
yeah 
good 
good 
yeah  this town really
is its own little world  isn t it 
yeah  i forgot how hard it is
to move to a new place 
tell me about it 
it was hard for me to move here  too 
and now it seems like
you ve been here forever 
it took a while 
then everything fell apart 
or i tore it apart 
either way 
i assume david told you 
it was my affair that ended everything 
oh  um   
yes 
affair is too strong a word for it 
it was really only twice 
i was just so frustrated and isolated 
david was consumed with work 
always home late 
he barely even knew i existed 
i mean  everything you just said 
you don t know anybody  you re lonely 
your whole life is in flux  but he s
having a completely different experience 
you have far more going on 
i only had david and lily 
she s so sweet  by the way 
she is  thank you 
  thank you  val 
  thank you 
mmm 
julia 
can i confess something 
sure  yes 
i was   
i was really very scared to meet you 
  me 
  yes  it s intimidating 
this glamorous life in the city 
you re an editor
and gorgeous and talented
and effortlessly beautiful 
thank you 
that s very lovely of you to say 
and i was terrified to meet you 
i mean  obviously because
of lily and everything 
but then on top of that  you re perfect 
all the time 
thank you  you re gonna do great here 
and your connection with david  it s   
you talk  you laugh 
what  you didn t 
not really 
come on 
we always loved each other  of course 
but ours was a more physical thing 
we always had incredible chemistry 
david was insatiable 
it eclipsed everything 
frankly  it was a little exhausting 
a different position every night 
public places 
it s like we just could not
get away from each other 
but i m sure i don t have
to tell you how he is 
yeah  he s amazing 
you know there was a time when i thought
we were on the road
to getting back together 
we even went to therapy 
but then he met you 
we ll always be close 
you can t get any closer
than having a child together 
the infinite bond
of our gorgeous little girl 
oh  i keep forgetting 
let me see the ring 
oh  um   
it s getting cleaned 
yeah  it was david s grandmother s ring 
oh 
well  next time 
i really actually have to get going 
i m buying lily a new horse 
upgrading from the pony she usually rides 
she s really excited 
i bet 
i m really glad that we did this 
it was nice 
i ll see you soon 
we re certified organic 
i m hungry 
me  too  we re gonna wait
till we get to daddy s booth
and then we re gonna have lunch
with him  okay 
this is probably him 
who is this 
who is this 
come on 
lily 
but i couldn t stop 
lily 
lily 
hey 
what happened  where s lily 
i don t know  she just ran off 
okay  how long ago did you lose her 
just now  a few minutes ago  maybe 
i don t know 
david  shit  i m sorry 
i m gonna get security 
you just keep looking  okay 
okay 
guys  hold down the fort 
i ll be right back 
you got it 
lily 
lily 
okay 
okay 
lily 
lily 
lily 
sorry  sorry  sorry  sorry 
i m sorry 
just wandering around by herself 
and i saw her talking to some guy
that she said knows julia 
david  listen  this is
completely unacceptable 
this is total negligence on her part 
i can t have it 
yeah  i got it 
i understand how it looks 
it was an accident 
it could have happened to any of us 
you know how she   
tessa said that she found lily
talking to some guy
she d never met before 
what guv  
i don t know  all right  she seemed
to think that you knew him 
she did  what did she say 
i just wanna know if it s true 
if what is true 
i don t know who she s talking about 
where s your ring  julia 
how come you haven t been wearing it 
nowhere 
i took it off to take a bath the other day
and i thought i knew
where i placed it  but   
it s gotta be in the house  though 
so  i ve been looking for it 
why would you tell tessa
that it s being cleaned then 
i don t know  i   
why did she bring it up 
who sent you flowers 
i don t know 
i called to find out and ask and   
it must have been a mistake 
look  
i get that
you re going through a rough time 
that  uh  it s an adjustment period
or whatever 
maybe you even feel lost 
okay  i   
i don t feel    who said i feel lost 
did tessa say that i feel lost 
because i don t feel lost 
i m sorry i didn t tell you
about the ring 
i m sorry about today 
tessa said she s not comfortable
having lily in the house 
what 
she doesn t want you alone with lily 
david  that s ridiculous 
yeah  i know  i know  it s   
i gotta let this blow over for a few days 
i can t have her spiral
and open up the custody stuff 
she s fucking with me 
julia  listen to me 
oh  my god 
tessa may be wound a little tight 
nobody knows that better than me 
trust me  but   
she is the mother of my daughter 
she loves lily more than anything
and she found her wandering
in a parking lot 
okay  that is where this is coming from 
i know 
i ll try harder 
i ll just try harder 
yeah  i know you will 
i know 
listen  i got some work to do 
i m gonna go downstairs 
i ll be back up in a bit 
lily 
you see  the horse knows
that you are not in control 
if you act afraid  she has every right
to think that she s in charge 
so  sit back  find your seat 
take a deep breath 
i drove a long way out here  my darling 
hi  lily 
hi 
what are you doing here 
where s david 
david got stuck at work 
he ll be waiting for us at home 
i hope so 
so  how s it going 
she s a beauty 
i m scared 
luv 
you re just getting used
to riding a new horse  you re fine 
i don t wanna ride her 
you re not getting off this horse 
she doesn t seem to feel safe 
i m sorry  who asked you 
she s safer here
than she is alone with you 
you re ready 
lily  relax 
okay 
come on  lily  it s daddy s day 
we re leaving 
it s okay 
lily 
don t you get off this horse 
what are you   
david s gonna hear about this 
i m sure 
that was beneath you 
i m gonna be in trouble 
me  too 
lily 
i know what it s like to love someone
who isn t always nice to you 
my dad had a way of making me feel
like everything was my fault 
but i want you to know that you are
a very  very special little girl 
and you didn t do anything wrong 
okay 
who was the man you were talking to
at the market the other day 
what man 
never mind 
  yeah  well  technically it was our day 
  yes 
technically  it is my day  but   
i can t find that damn watch you got me 
maybe i just stay here tonight 
you know 
you could just cancel the babysitter   
i can stay with lily 
no 
you should be at this dinner with me 
all my principal investors
are gonna be there 
okay 
okay 
but if it wasn t for you guys
here at this table 
copper mountain brewery wouldn t be here 
so  from miguel and i 
thank you very much and cheers 
  cheers 
  to copper mountain  yes  cheers 
congratulations 
exactly right 
oh  no  you should 
we had a three to four plan
that we were   
really proud of david 
he and miguel had a really
impressive return on investment 
considering the size of their operation 
  oh  you re kidding me 
  that s unbelievable 
that s right 
when i first came back
from new york 
it was kind of a culture shock 
what we had was more physical 
he s insatiable 
public places 
we couldn t get away from each other 
i m so happy that all of you
could come tonight 
i just really appreciate it 
well  we won t tell anybody
you said that

she thinks that s because of me 
why are you doing this 
  i don t know what you mean 
  yes  you do 
okay  this is really difficult
for everyone 
but it doesn t have to
actually be this hard 
i m not doing anything  julia 
i am simply living my life with my family 
if you re having a hard time 
i suggest you look in the mirror 
no  i know exactly what it is
that you are trying to do 
and i am not gonna let you put lily
in the middle of this anymore 
are you threatening me

i got in her face  i grabbed her arm 
but i did not push her 
and i think she might have
slipped on purpose 
yeah  maybe the truth lies
somewhere in between 
why would you believe the person
who gave up on you instead of me 
what does that mean 
tessa told me that she had an affair 
and you never told me that 
listen   
because it s not why i left her 
i wanted to leave tessa years before that 
i stayed because of lily 
the affair   
the affair just confirmed things 
she said that you guys were trying to
get back together when you met me 
and that you were taking couples therapy 
never
never  never were we trying to reconcile 
i ve no idea why she would say
something like that 
because she s fucking crazy  david

i left her 
i left her  okay 
and i am sitting here  across from you 
and i wanna marry you
and i really don t wanna spend
