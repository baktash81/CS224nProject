your alleged assailant
michael vargas
he was convicted and served
12 months probation
im sorry that happened to you
they dated for two years
and you were treated in
a psychiatric hospital after the incident
that was my choice
but after the restraining order was up
you tried to resume contact
you tell me ms banks

go back and reunite with mr vargas
no
we downloaded the contents
of mr vargas phone
i have almost 50 pages
of facebook messages
between you and mr vargas
these belong to you
yes
but you dont understand i
the man is dead
found in your home
with your face all over his phone
and your delicates found in his car

this company was about right
taking risks adventures
and bringing stories to life
although she clearly didnt get the memo
that mindset only applies
to adventures we have together

for her next chapter

so many stories to life

for tess the way she wanted
in more ways than one
what do you mean
well at first we thought
tessa was amazing
star at stanford super charming
so together
all the big firms
were recruiting her too
but then she changed
got possessive turned into gollum
and david was her precious
oh wow
we were thrilled when
david finally broke up with her
then turns out she was pregnant
thats perfect right
so she and her mother
cruella chanel
moved with david to new york
cause you know david
he did the right thing
and then she had to watch him
leave it all behind for the brewery
bingo
we go to the brew pub
in san francisco
walk in and i just i just see her
sitting across the restaurant
talking to her crazy friend
and i got it i got it

davids jury summons came to me
he did live there for years
its not always all about you julia
if youre going to be a parent
especially to my daughter
id like you to learn that lesson fast
youre sure theyre not
from david connover
and what do you mean theres no record
of who sent the arrangement
how is that possible
the order was done anonymously
im not sure where its coming from
okay
sorry about that
thank you
have a nice day
jules were home
hi julia
no go to sleep
well maybe its because
the restraining order is up
and i cant renew it
but i just feel like its him
making these calls
take a deep breath all right
no one knows where you live
youre not on facebook or twitter
you basically dont exist
and this has happened before
remember when we were up in big sur
and you thought he was following us
in that truck
yeah but
or you thought you saw him at the window
but it was really just david
youre right
you still havent told david
what happened to you huh
its gonna be
really hard to tell him ali
really hard
i dont want him to see me like that
i dont want it to change anything
hey what about calling that doctor
that you liked so much at the meadows
no
im okay
hell love me no matter what right
there is nothing not to love
i love you and i dont even like people

no
im sorry
i shouldnt have snapped at you

thanks tessa

yeah
good
good
yeah this town really
is its own little world isnt it
yeah i forgot how hard it is
to move to a new place
tell me about it
it was hard for me to move here too
and now it seems like
youve been here forever
it took a while
then everything fell apart
or i tore it apart
either way
i assume david told you
it was my affair that ended everything
oh um
yes
affair is too strong a word for it
it was really only twice
i was just so frustrated and isolated
david was consumed with work
always home late
he barely even knew i existed
i mean everything you just said
you dont know anybody youre lonely
your whole life is in flux but hes
having a completely different experience
you have far more going on
i only had david and lily
shes so sweet by the way
she is thank you
thank you val
thank you
mmm
julia
can i confess something
sure yes
i was
i was really very scared to meet you
me
yes its intimidating
this glamorous life in the city
youre an editor
and gorgeous and talented
and effortlessly beautiful
thank you
thats very lovely of you to say
and i was terrified to meet you
i mean obviously because
of lily and everything
but then on top of that youre perfect
all the time
thank you youre gonna do great here
and your connection with david its
you talk you laugh
what you didnt
not really
come on
we always loved each other of course
but ours was a more physical thing
we always had incredible chemistry
david was insatiable
it eclipsed everything
frankly it was a little exhausting
a different position every night
public places
its like we just could not
get away from each other
but im sure i dont have
to tell you how he is
yeah hes amazing
you know there was a time when i thought
we were on the road
to getting back together
we even went to therapy
but then he met you
well always be close
you cant get any closer
than having a child together
the infinite bond
of our gorgeous little girl
oh i keep forgetting
let me see the ring
oh um
its getting cleaned
yeah it was davids grandmothers ring
oh
well next time
i really actually have to get going
im buying lily a new horse
upgrading from the pony she usually rides
shes really excited
i bet
im really glad that we did this
it was nice

it could have happened to any of us
you know how she
tessa said that she found lily
talking to some guy
shed never met before

i dont know all right she seemed
to think that you knew him
she did what did she say
i just wanna know if its true

i dont know who shes talking about
wheres your ring julia
how come you havent been wearing it
nowhere
i took it off to take a bath the other day
and i thought i knew
where i placed it but
its gotta be in the house though
so ive been looking for it
why would you tell tessa
that its being cleaned then
i dont know i
why did she bring it up
who sent you flowers
i dont know
i called to find out and ask and
it must have been a mistake
look
i get that
youre going through a rough time
that uh its an adjustment period
or whatever
maybe you even feel lost
okay i
i dont feel who said i feel lost
did tessa say that i feel lost
because i dont feel lost
im sorry i didnt tell you
about the ring
im sorry about today
tessa said shes not comfortable
having lily in the house
what
she doesnt want you alone with lily
david thats ridiculous
yeah i know i know its
i gotta let this blow over for a few days
i cant have her spiral
and open up the custody stuff
shes fucking with me
julia listen to me
oh my god
tessa may be wound a little tight
nobody knows that better than me
trust me but
she is the mother of my daughter
she loves lily more than anything
and she found her wandering
in a parking lot
okay that is where this is coming from
i know
ill try harder
ill just try harder
yeah i know you will
i know
listen i got some work to do
im gonna go downstairs
ill be back up in a bit
lily

we had a three to four plan
that we were
really proud of david
he and miguel had a really
impressive return on investment
considering the size of their operation

thats right
when i first came back
from new york
it was kind of a culture shock
what we had was more physical

there are lessons to be learned
thats some sort of punishment
no its a reality
i couldnt keep up with your knots
she thinks thats because of me
why are you doing this
i dont know what you mean
yes you do
okay this is really difficult
for everyone
but it doesnt have to
actually be this hard
im not doing anything julia
i am simply living my life with my family
if youre having a hard time
i suggest you look in the mirror
no i know exactly what it is
that you are trying to do
and i am not gonna let you put lily
in the middle of this anymore

when i saw what she did to lily
yeah i did i got angry
i got in her face i grabbed her arm
but i did not push her
and i think she might have
slipped on purpose
yeah maybe the truth lies
somewhere in between
why would you believe the person
who gave up on you instead of me
what does that mean
tessa told me that she had an affair
and you never told me that
listen
because its not why i left her
i wanted to leave tessa years before that
i stayed because of lily
the affair
the affair just confirmed things
she said that you guys were trying to
get back together when you met me
and that you were taking couples therapy
never
never never were we trying to reconcile
ive no idea why she would say
something like that
because shes fucking crazy david
why cant you see that
i left her
i left her okay
and i am sitting here across from you
and i wanna marry you
and i really dont wanna spend
the rest of my life
playing she said she said
