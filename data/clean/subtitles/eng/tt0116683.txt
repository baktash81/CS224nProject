and i have tasted
a lot 
  i ve eaten manystrange and
scrumptious dishes in my time  
  like chili bugs
and curried slugs  
  and earwigs
cooked in slime  
  and mice with rice
is very nice  
 when they re roasted
in their prime  
  but don t forget
tosprinkle them 
 with just a pinch
of grime  
  i m crazy about mosquitos
on a piece ofbuttered toast  
  and pickled spines of porcupines
and then a great big roast  
  and dragon s flesh quite old
not fresh  it costs a buck at most  
does it come with gravy  
  it comes toyou in barrels
ifyou order it by post  
  together    it comes toyou
in barrels ifyou order it by post  
  for dinner
on my birthday

what i chose  
  hot noodles made ofpoodles
on a slice of garden hose  
  and a rather
smellyjelly

hold your nose  
  peach  peach  peach
