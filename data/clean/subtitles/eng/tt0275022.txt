do you have any idea what its like
being surrounded by girls
being a girl yourself
i know stupid question
but im a guy okay
im a guyjust a guy
and i have been listening
to girl talk and watching you do
your girl things for days
im not complaining cause
lets face it im outnumbered
but thats my car
its my car and its just
its the one thing that hasnt
been taken over by chicks
okay
okay
ben
yeah
were you really in jail
yeah i was
so you killed a guy
what
who said i killed a guy
everybody back home
oh man
no i didnt kill a guy
what did you do then
i was in college and i get
this call from my stepsister
she wants me to come get her cause
my stepdad is beating her up
my mom cant stop him so
i drive home in
the middle of the night
and she throws her things out
the window and climbs out
and then i drive her back
to school in ohio with me
and you went to jail for that
thats the thing
theres this law
against driving a child thats
not a relative across state lines
and my stepdad of course
pressed charges
but you know its okay
i only got six months
and i had to stay in ohio
for a years probation
my sister got to go live
with her mom
you all really thought
i killed a guy
yeah
what were you thinking getting
into a car with a homicidal maniac
why are we stopping
youll see
mimi you okay
oh yeah im fine
look
its like you have to whisper
hello
man we gotta make time the next
hotel is still an hour away
ben do you have enough
sleeping bags for all of us
you serious
you really want to camp here
yeah
it sounds like fun
you gotta keep your thumb
on the outside like this
right now the trick is
you dont want to let him know
that youre gonna hit him
maybe like look away first
and then when he least expects it
you throw your whole body into it
what are you doing to her
im teaching her how to fight
because every girl
should know how
to throw a decent punch
that was decent
im gonna go to bed
im gonna go to the ladies room
