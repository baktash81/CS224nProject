really raise my voice
wanna make some noise
really raise my voice
yeah  i m gonna scream and shout
get a little outta line
i ain  t gonna act
politically correct
i only wanna have a good time
the best thing about being a woman
is the prerogative
to have a little fun and
oh  oh  oh
go totally crazy
  hi  did you have a good nap  
  yeah 
stop  stop the car 
don t be mad  you looked so sweet
when you were sleeping 
  we just didn t wanna wake you 
  stop the car 
  it s against the law to park here 
  it s my car 
  we re almost at an exit 
  stop the damn car 
  mimi  go talk to him 
  uh uh  you go talk to him 
  nobody s gonna go talk to him 
  i know  he s mad 
and he has killed before 
mimi  you said
he didn t kill anyone 
  i said i thought he didn t 
  oh  my god 
  it s okay  i ll go 
  i m sorry 
god 
be careful  lucy 
  we re sorry 
  i ve been in a car full of chicks 
do you have any idea what it s like
being surrounded by girls  
being a girl yourself 
i know  stupid question 
but i m a guy  okay  
i m a guy just a guy 
and i have been listening
to girl talk and watching you do   
your girl things for days 
i m not complaining   cause 
let s face it  i m outnumbered 
but that s my car 
it s my car  and it s just  
it s the one thing that hasn t
been taken over by chicks 
  okay  
  okay 
  ben  
  yeah  
were you really in jail  
yeah  i was 
  so you killed a guy  
  what  
who said i killed a guy  
everybody back home 
oh  man 
no  i didn t kill a guy 
what did you do then  
i was in college  and i get
this call from my stepsister 
she wants me to come get her  cause
my stepdad is beating her up 
my mom can t stop him  so   
i drive home in
the middle of the night   
and she throws her things out
the window and climbs out   
and then i drive her back
to school in ohio with me 
  and you went to jail for that  
  that s the thing 
there s this law   
against driving a child that s
not a relative across state lines   
and my stepdad of course
pressed charges 
but  you know  it s okay 
i only got six months   
and i had to stay in ohio
for a year s probation 
my sister got to go live
with her mom 
you all really thought
i killed a guy  
yeah 
what were you thinking getting
into a car with a homicidal maniac  
  why are we stopping  
  you ll see 
  mimi  you okay  
  oh  yeah  i m fine 
look 
it s like you have to whisper 
hello 
man  we gotta make time  the next
hotel is still an hour away 
ben  do you have enough
sleeping bags for all of us  
you serious  
you really want to camp here  
yeah 
it sounds like fun 
you gotta keep your thumb
on the outside like this 
right  now  the trick is   
you don t want to let him know
that you re gonna hit him 
maybe like look away first 
and then  when he least expects it 
you throw your whole body into it 
what are you doing to her  
i m teaching her how to fight
because every girl   
should know how
to throw a decent punch 
that was decent 
i m gonna go to bed 
i m gonna go to the ladies room 
where is it again  
third bush after the rock
over there 
  this one  
  that one  yeah 
what are you always
writing in there  
poems  mostly 
can i hear one  
okay  one 
but you can t laugh 
 i used to think i had
the answers to everything   
but now i know that life
doesn t always go my way 
it feels like i m caught in the
middle  and that s when i realize   
that i m not a girl 
and not yet a woman 
all i need is time 
just a moment that s mine 
and while i m in between 
i m not a girl
