you re infected  when were
you gonna tell us that 
  let me see 
  no 
you know i m not gonna hurt you 
let me see 
it s the antivirus
the cure to the t virus 
there s a cure 
how did you get this 
my daddy 
my daddy made it for me 
he s sick 
and someday i ii get sick too 
he just wanted to stop that 
when i was little   
   i had to walk on crutches 
they said i d never get better
just worse 
he found a way
to make me stronger 
the t virus 
then they took the invention
away from him 
get out of my house 
he s not a bad man 
he didn t mean for any of this 
it s okay 
don t shoot  he s cool 
he made a deal with dr  doom
same as you 
how many of you guys are there 
what do you mean 
nicholai 
when were you bitten 
  three hours ago 
  what the    
it s your lucky day 
should have told me you got bit 
i m hanging with you and shit 
  let me speak to my daughter 
  first you tell us how we re getting out 
there s a helicopter
already being prepped 
it takes off in 47 minutes 
it ll be the last transport to leave
raccoon city before they detonate 
i take it this helicopter isn t
laid out just for us 
no  it has another purpose
but it ll be lightly guarded 
  where s the evac site 
  may i speak to my daughter now 
  daddy 
  hey sweetheart 
  are you all right 
  when can i see you 
soon  these people will
bring you to see me 
i ll see you very soon

where do we have to go 
the helicopter will be at city hall 
i suggest you make haste 
computers   
   so unreliable 
just like people 
you really thought i didn t know 
so what are you injecting me with 
the antivirus 
the t virus reanimates dead cells 
basically bringing the dead to life 
or in a living human
it can cause uncontrollable mutation 
or it can help her walk again
if the virus is kept in check with this 
  angie s infected 
  yes 
the cellular growth is enough
to regenerate her   
   but not enough to cause mutation 
and they infected you
with the t virus as well 
yeah 
but don t worry 
i m not contagious 
here 
tape the story 
i ll see that it gets put to good use 
my name is alice 
i worked for the
umbrella corporation   
   the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world 
i was head of security at a secret
high tech facility called the hive   
   a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental   
   viral weaponry 
let s go 
you missed one 
we have to hurry 
  we re okay  we have time 
  no  we have to hurry 
  holy shit  we stealing his ride

  what s the rush 
we ve been expecting you 
  perimeter secure 
  all sectors locked down 
  angie 
  daddy 
  i knew you wouldn t leave me 
  no  never 
discard primary weaponry 
the two of you showed such promise
but we had to see you in action 
and most impressive you ve been 
you re like brother and sister 
heightened speed strength
agility the same killer instincts 
parallel strands of research 
and now   
now we ll discover which is superior 
fight him 
no 
fight him or they die 
what makes you think i care 
daddy  daddy no 
no 
he was a valuable asset
to the corporation 
i don t even care
about these people 
begin 
he s mutating  i want him
in the nemesis program 
matt 
cellular structure breaking down 
t  virus is manifesting itself
in a genetic mutation 
we re seeing similar
cellular regeneration 
i m sorry 
oh matt  i m so sorry 
finish him 
i said finish him 
no 
no 
don t you understand
how important you are to me 
that creature is one thing
but you   
   somehow you bonded
with the t virus on a cellular level 
you adapted it changed it 
you became magnificent 
  i became a freak 
  no 
you re not mutation 
you re evolution 
with my help just imagine
what you can achieve 
what about him 
evolution has its dead ends 
now finish this 
put him out of his misery   
   and come with me 
no 
you re such
a disappointment to me 
all that strength   
   but no will to use it 
what a waste 
prepare for takeoff 
sanitation of raccoon city
