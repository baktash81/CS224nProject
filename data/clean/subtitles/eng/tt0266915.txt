now stay away before i throw you

throw us in jail 
you must be outta your mind 
i m about to bust you right now 
i m an undercover agent for
the united states secret service 
how do we know that 
show me a badge right now 
here you go 
let me see that again 
i didn t get a good look at that 
we can help you 
i m a detective from hong kong 
i know who you are 
inspector lee  i know 
we need to go out of sight 
so come down to my suite 
  why did you say it was a bomb 
  no  you said that 
  no  you said it 
  you said that in the hotel room 
i said she was the bomb 
she was the bomb 
look  i ve been working
this case for months now   
so if i seem a little
aggravated  i apologize 
you need to tell us
what s goin  on 
the triads and reign think
i m a crooked customs agent 
  is that a payoff 
  no  that s a sample 
you guys ever heard
of the superbill 
i heard of it  it s a myth 
some kind of counterfeit 
honey  it s much more
than a counterfeit 
fourteen out of fifteen world banks
can t even tell the difference 
the paper is crane linen blend   
and the bills are printed
on u s  intaglio presses 
you wanna tell us how they get into
the u s  mint to use the presses 
in 1959  the united states was
very friendly with the shah of iran 
why  because we wanted his oil 
our government
gave him a gift   
a u s  treasury
intaglio printing press 
now  it s the only one
to ever leave the country 
five years ago  ricky tan bought
the press on the black market 
five years ago 
that s right before
he left the force 
ricky tan got hold of one of a kind
swiss made hundred dollar plates   
and he started printing
superbills 
that s why hu li killed him   
for the plates 
and they ve printed and shipped
one hundred million dollars 
there s only one way
to spot a fake 
they use an optical transfer ink
from india that burns red 
you see  now  the real ink 
it burns black 
you know  carter  i believe
you re asking the wrong question 
the real question is 
where are the plates 
because if we can find the plates 
we can stop the whole operation 
  right 
  yeah  you re right 
maybe this is where
you can help us  guys 
yeah  carter 
this is your city  right 
yeah  this is my titty 
i mean  this is my city 
great  and lee  you know
hu li and the triads  correct 
  yes
