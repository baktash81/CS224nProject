look ive been working
this case for months now
so if i seem a little
aggravated i apologize
you need to tell us
whats goin on
the triads and reign think
im a crooked customs agent
is that a payoff
no thats a sample
you guys ever heard
of the superbill
i heard of it its a myth
some kind of counterfeit
honey its much more
than a counterfeit
fourteen out of fifteen world banks
cant even tell the difference
the paper is crane linen blend
and the bills are printed
on us intaglio presses
you wanna tell us how they get into
the us mint to use the presses
in 1959 the united states was
very friendly with the shah of iran
why because we wanted his oil
our government
gave him a gift
a us treasury
intaglio printing press
now its the only one
to ever leave the country
five years ago ricky tan bought
the press on the black market
five years ago
thats right before
he left the force
ricky tan got hold of oneofakind
swissmade hundreddollar plates
and he started printing
superbills
thats why hu li killed him
for the plates
and theyve printed and shipped
one hundred million dollars
theres only one way
to spot a fake
they use an optical transfer ink
from india that burns red
you see now the real ink
it burns black
you know carter i believe
youre asking the wrong question
the real question is
where are the plates
because if we can find the plates
we can stop the whole operation
right
yeah youre right
maybe this is where
you can help us guys
yeah carter
this is your city right
yeah this is my titty
i mean this is my city
