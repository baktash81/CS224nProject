mama 
father brian 
sorry to disturb 
yes of course 
come in  katherine 
sit down 
thank you dawn 
mr  walch tells me your recital s
coming along very  very nicely 
sorry i won t be around to see it 
but i m sure that you ll enjoy performing for your
friends and your parents all the same  won t you 
where are you going 
i have some personal business in albany 
how long does it take to get to albany 
oh    couple of hours    by train 
so about the same exact time to
come back then  i guess    huh 
katherine   
are you concerned about something 
i mean just wish you could
stay and see my performance 
that s all 
well  i m sorry but this time
it just can t be helped 
when do you come back 
after the break   
with everyone else  i should imagine 
is something funny 
funny 
no 
why 
you smiled a little 
i did 
yes you did 
i was just thinking to say i hope
you have a fun time in albany 
headache  you say 
and my throat kinda hurts when i swallow 
you poor thing   
it would be a shame to
be sick over the break 
i know   
here you are  dear 
so you really think i should tell him 
rose  of course you have to tell him 
it s like half his 
it s half his problem anyway 
no it isn t 
not really 
well it should be 
he s the one who got you in this
situation in the first place 
he knew exactly what he was doing 
like i didn t 
he was doing it to me 
and i was liking it 
don t laugh 
it s so not funny 
besides it s only been four days 
i could still get it 
you think you re going
to tell your parents 
of course  everyone is excited
to have your parents come and
tour the classrooms and share your life
here at bramford with them 
but that doesn t mean
there s going to be any change when
when it comes to con duct ex pec ta tions 
if anything  conduct is more
important today than any other day
because today we are all here
today representing bramford 
and that means that you are representing
all the young women who came before you
and all the women who will follow you
after you ve moved on 
sound good 
sounds good   
and if i don t see you before you
leave  have a great week off
we ll see you on the   
rose 
where are you going 
i was gonna check out
some of the performance 
you okay 
yeah  of course
where are your parents 
they re waiting inside
so i better go 
okay  well    i ll see you
next week then  okay 
katherine   
have you checked your cellular phone 
maybe they called you there 
i don t have one yet 
they said maybe for my birthday 
you know  bad weather coming in
all over the east coast an 
maybe they got caught up in that 
planes get delayed 
and rose  what about you 
i thought we got out on friday so
i told my parents to come on friday 
guess i spaced out 
were you able to reach them 
yeah    it just may take a day or so
to change their plans 
  a day 
  yeah   cause they re   
planning on coming
on friday so they ll
probably still come on friday 
all right  well    miss prescott
and miss drake
will be here in any case 
now do you hear that  katherine 
it happens that parents get confused and
worst case is they come on friday
and everyone goes home
and has a really nice break anyway
after all    we can t let you live here 
rose  would you look after kat
until her parents arrive 
i actually haven t been feeling very well 
i have a really sore throat 
i was gonna stay in bed
uh  miss prescott 
you will call mr cornish
in a few hours  both on his home
phone and his mobile

sound good 
katherine 
sounds good 
hey    dad

  me 
nowhere
and if the sisters say anything  just tell them
i wasn t feeling well so i m staying in bed 
you do know about the sisters  don t you 
know what 
you know they wear wigs  right 
you know they have no hair on their bodies 
no hair anywhere
next time  check their eyebrows 
totally fake 
the real ones    burned right off 
that s not true 
you didn t hear about jen darling s sister 
graduated three years ago 
she walked in on them one night   
worshipping the devil 
who told you 
don t come in my room  okay 
and don t touch my shit 
th    uh  there s someone in here 
i m sorry  the number you have dialled has
been disconnected or is no longer in service 
are you okay 
you can t be warm enough in that jacket 
are you waiting for someone 
can we give you a lift somewhere 
you gotta be freezing 
where are you heading 
we re gonna get back on the highway and
then we re gonna head east a little while 
how  bout you  you heading someplace 
  portsmith

i m parked right over there  my
wife s waiting in the car
see  right there 
my name s bill 
what s your name 
joan 
my name s joan 
nice  nice name 
bill  what re you doing 
just trying to help 
c mon 
we ll take her to the next gas station 
i m trying to help

i don t have my phone 
so that s it 
stop saying that 
what am i supposed to say

careful   
yeah  right 
idiot 
katherine 
it s bill 
from the bus station 
do you mind if i come in 
just wanted to see how you re doing 
i see you re up at least 
so   
i guess you re pretty
zonked out there  huh 
you slept for four hours in the backseat 
i m sorry 
for what 
first rule 
you don t apologise to me  young lady 
i m happy to help  okay 
i m sorry   
it s okay 
why are you doing this 
doing what 
helping me so much 
do you believe in god  joan 
no  just like that 
ever try to look for him 
it s strange 
people think you look for him
in some book  or a church or
a statue
maybe even a candle flame 
but that s not how it works for me 
i look for him in the
unlikely things that happen 
little co cidences 
when i saw you sitting
at that bus station 
you reminded me so much
of someone   
someone i haven t seen
in a long time   
and then  when you said you
were going to portsmith   
well    a coincidence like that
i just can t ignore it 
so strange as it may sound 
i guess i saw god in you 
are you going to portsmith too 
no  not exactly 
linda and i are headed
to the town just before it   
we re going to bramford 
do you know bramford 
what s that 
when do we leave 
what s your hurry 
where s your wife 
she s sleeping 
why 
well  hopefully we can   
get out of here first thing
in the morning 
i  uh    bet you re pretty hungry 
there s a restaurant next door 
why don t you get dressed 
come down and have some dinner 
you know how much trouble
i could get into for this 
do you need a towel 
so what were you doing down there 
were you sleepwalking 
do you sleepwalk  is that
what that was 
what about your parents 
did they call 
they re not going to call 
they just got confused 
like your parents 
but your parents didn t get confused 
you told them not to come
so you could go out on a date 
  it wasn t a date 
  it wasn t 
  no  it wasn t 
  what was it 
nothing 
mr gordon said you were
supposed to look after me 
i know what mr gordon said 
mr gordon said worst case they d
be here by friday 
  yeah  i know what he said   
  and now it s too late 
too late for what 
they re dead 
that is an awful thing to say 
you shouldn t say things like that 
you shouldn t say things like that 
okay  it s just not funny 
you smell pretty   
you should go to bed 
just go to bed  then when you wake up
in the morning   
you re gonna be okay  alright 
they ll be here on friday 
they re already on their way 
that s it  ok 
that s it 
you should go to bed now 
is there anything else i can get you 
no  you had your chance 
there she is
linda has an extra coat 
it s a lot warmer than yours 
she won t mind if you borrow it 
she s gonna be along any minute 
so    portsmith  huh 
is that your home 
your mom and dad 
no 
no   
friends  someone 
  someone 
  that s better than having no one  isn t it 
they changed the decor of
this place a few years ago 
used to be more of a kid s place 
famous for their chicken noodle soup 
that s how we came by it anyway 
linda and i used to  uh  spend a lot
of time here with our daughter 
remember i told you that you 
uh  remind me of somebody 
you reminded me of her    my daughter 
she d be right about your age by now 
we lost her nine years ago 
nine years  uh   
tomorrow  actually 
and it s okay  we do okay   
it s difficult but uh   
you know what they say 
time heals all wounds 
and little by little it does
get easier  except   
around this time of year when
we go and lay flowers   
on the anniversary 
i ve got a picture 
that s my rose 
she s pretty 
yes she is  isn t she 
have you decided 
oh  uh  yes i ve decided 
  joan  you decided 
  excuse me 
oh  there you are 
look  we ve got some  uh  really
bad weather coming in overnight 
and if we don t get on the road tonight 
we re gonna be snowed in tomorrow 
maybe the day after 
they re gonna pack up our food for us  so why
don t you grab it and meet me out front 
what did he tell you

when he told you about
our daughter he said

he told you  you remind
him of her

of course  i never see it 
of course it isn t true 
but still sometimes i try 
i saw it once 
i was at the supermarket alone 
and i was standing in the middle
of a long aisle all by myself 
and a girl came  round the corner 
she was looking on a low
shelf for something 
she s about 15 
and she had her money held
tightly in her hand
like children do 
i guess school had gone back already 
she was just in her uniform  skirt   
sneakers    with no socks 
her knees were pink 
it was red from the cold 
but what did she know 
she had her hair in a ponytail
and i could see the roots being
pulled back from her ears 
you don t look anything like her 
it s strange 
i can t see you at all 
well what did they say 
what did they say 
he said it s all right 
wait  what s all right 
who says

but i can    with him
