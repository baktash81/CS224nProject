mama
father brian
sorry to disturb
yes of course
come in katherine
sit down
thank you dawn
mr walch tells me your recitals
coming along very very nicely
sorry i wont be around to see it
but im sure that youll enjoy performing for your
friends and your parents all the same wont you
where are you going
i have some personal business in albany
how long does it take to get to albany
oh couple of hours by train
so about the same exact time to
come back then i guess huh
katherine
are you concerned about something
i mean just wish you could
stay and see my performance
thats all
well im sorry but this time
it just cant be helped
when do you come back
after the break
with everyone else i should imagine
is something funny
funny
no
why
you smiled a little
i did
yes you did
i was just thinking to say i hope
you have a fun time in albany
headache you say
and my throat kinda hurts when i swallow
you poor thing
it would be a shame to
be sick over the break
i know
here you are dear
so you really think i should tell him
rose of course you have to tell him
its like half his
its half his problem anyway
no it isnt
not really
well it should be
hes the one who got you in this
situation in the first place
he knew exactly what he was doing
like i didnt
he was doing it to me
and i was liking it
dont laugh
its so not funny
besides its only been four days
i could still get it
you think youre going
to tell your parents
of course everyone is excited
to have your parents come and
tour the classrooms and share your life
here at bramford with them
but that doesnt mean
theres going to be any change when
when it comes to conduct expectations
if anything conduct is more
important today than any other day
because today we are all here
today representing bramford
and that means that you are representing
all the young women who came before you
and all the women who will follow you
after youve moved on
sound good
sounds good
and if i dont see you before you
leave have a great week off
well see you on the
rose
where are you going
i was gonna check out
some of the performance
you okay
yeah of course
where are your parents
theyre waiting inside
so i better go
okay well ill see you
next week then okay
katherine
have you checked your cellular phone
maybe they called you there
i dont have one yet
they said maybe for my birthday
you know bad weather coming in
all over the east coast an
maybe they got caught up in that
planes get delayed
and rose what about you
i thought we got out on friday so
i told my parents to come on friday
guess i spaced out
were you able to reach them
yeah it just may take a day or so
to change their plans
a day
yeah cause theyre
planning on coming
on friday so theyll
probably still come on friday
all right well miss prescott
and miss drake
will be here in any case
now do you hear that katherine
it happens that parents get confused and
worst case is they come on friday
and everyone goes home
and has a really nice break anyway
after all we cant let you live here
rose would you look after kat
until her parents arrive
i actually havent been feeling very well
i have a really sore throat
i was gonna stay in bed
uh miss prescott

in a few hours both on his home
phone and his mobile

sound good
katherine
sounds good
hey dad

just calling to see where
you and mom were
if youre coming

dear lord
thank you for this meal that
you have placed in front of us
on this night
you know im not babysitting
you tonight right freshman
mr gordon said you were
supposed to stay with me

for not being in school over vacation
mr gordon said that
mr gordon said mr gordon said

and if the sisters say anything just tell them
i wasnt feeling well so im staying in bed
you do know about the sisters dont you

worshipping the devil
who told you

then were gonna head east a little while
how bout you you heading someplace
portsmith

careful
yeah right
idiot
katherine
its bill
from the bus station
do you mind if i come in
just wanted to see how youre doing
i see youre up at least
so
i guess youre pretty
zonked out there huh
you slept for four hours in the backseat
im sorry
for what
first rule
you dont apologise to me young lady
im happy to help okay
im sorry
its okay
why are you doing this
doing what
helping me so much
do you believe in god joan
no just like that
ever try to look for him
its strange
people think you look for him
in some book or a church or
a statue
maybe even a candle flame
but thats not how it works for me
i look for him in the
unlikely things that happen
little cocidences
when i saw you sitting
at that bus station
you reminded me so much
of someone
someone i havent seen
in a long time
and then when you said you
were going to portsmith
well a coincidence like that
i just cant ignore it
so strange as it may sound
i guess i saw god in you
are you going to portsmith too
no not exactly
linda and i are headed
to the town just before it
were going to bramford
do you know bramford
whats that
when do we leave
whats your hurry
wheres your wife
shes sleeping
why
well hopefully we can
get out of here first thing
in the morning
i uh bet youre pretty hungry
theres a restaurant next door
why dont you get dressed
come down and have some dinner
you know how much trouble
i could get into for this
do you need a towel
so what were you doing down there
were you sleepwalking
do you sleepwalk is that
what that was
what about your parents
did they call
theyre not going to call
they just got confused
like your parents
but your parents didnt get confused
you told them not to come
so you could go out on a date
it wasnt a date
it wasnt
no it wasnt
what was it
nothing
mr gordon said you were
supposed to look after me
i know what mr gordon said
mr gordon said worst case theyd
be here by friday
yeah i know what he said
and now its too late
too late for what
theyre dead
that is an awful thing to say
you shouldnt say things like that
you shouldnt say things like that
okay its just not funny
you smell pretty
you should go to bed
just go to bed then when you wake up
in the morning
youre gonna be okay alright
theyll be here on friday
theyre already on their way
thats it ok
thats it
you should go to bed now
is there anything else i can get you
no you had your chance
there she is
linda has an extra coat
its a lot warmer than yours
she wont mind if you borrow it
shes gonna be along any minute
so portsmith huh
is that your home
your mom and dad
no
no
friends someone
someone
thats better than having no one isnt it
they changed the decor of
this place a few years ago
used to be more of a kids place
famous for their chicken noodle soup
thats how we came by it anyway
linda and i used to uh spend a lot
of time here with our daughter
remember i told you that you
uh remind me of somebody
you reminded me of her my daughter
shed be right about your age by now
we lost her nine years ago
nine years uh
tomorrow actually
and its okay we do okay
its difficult but uh
you know what they say
time heals all wounds
and little by little it does
get easier except
around this time of year when
we go and lay flowers
on the anniversary
ive got a picture
thats my rose
shes pretty
yes she is isnt she
have you decided
oh uh yes ive decided
joan you decided
excuse me
oh there you are
look weve got some uh really
bad weather coming in overnight
and if we dont get on the road tonight
were gonna be snowed in tomorrow
maybe the day after
theyre gonna pack up our food for us so why
dont you grab it and meet me out front
what did he tell you
did he tell you about our daughter
when he told you about
our daughter he said
have didnt he
we have a daughter
he told you you remind
him of her
he actually said that to you
didnt he
its okay poor thing
he tries to say that to everyone
of course i never see it
of course it isnt true
but still sometimes i try
i saw it once
i was at the supermarket alone
and i was standing in the middle
of a long aisle all by myself
and a girl came round the corner
she was looking on a low
shelf for something
shes about 15
and she had her money held
tightly in her hand
like children do
i guess school had gone back already
she was just in her uniform skirt
sneakers with no socks
her knees were pink
it was red from the cold
but what did she know
she had her hair in a ponytail
and i could see the roots being
pulled back from her ears
you dont look anything like her
