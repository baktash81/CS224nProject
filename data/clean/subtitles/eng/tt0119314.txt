a million years before man
they grazed the vast
and empty plains
living by voices
only they could hear
they first came to know man
as the hunted knows the hunter
for long before he used horses
for his labours
he killed them for meat
the alliance with man
would forever be fragile
for the fear hed struck
into their hearts
was too deep to be dislodged
since that neolithic moment
when a horse was first haltered
there were those among men
who understood this
they could see
into the creatures soul
and soothe the wounds
they found there
the secrets uttered softly
into troubled ears
these men were known
as the whisperers
its perfectly shot
perfectly cropped
perfectly laid out
and i am so bloody bored
start again
thank you
would you excuse me for a moment
yes
hello
yeah this is tom booker
i got a message you called
oh hello mr booker
its annie maclean from cover
you know the magazine
um well thank you
for returning my call
is there something
i can do for you maam
yes yes
i read this article about what you do
for people with horse problems
well truth is i help horses
with people problems
well whichever way
you want to put it
uh this article said that you were
you were a a horse whisperer
oh they said that huh
a whisperer hmm
and i was hoping that youd come
to new york
and take a look at my daughters horse
and possibly do some
maam im sorry but im
im afraid youve misunderstood
whatever it is you read
because thats not exactly what i do
i mostly conduct clinics you see and
well could you come to new york
just for the day
its only a few hours by plane
and im not doin them now
im on my way to montana where i have
a ranch to take care of
well id pay your fare of course
uh first class
maam first class to montana
is a waste of good money
well if you could just give me a time
when youd be available
say am i am i being too polite here
when i say no in nevada
does that mean yes where you are
look im really sorry for your
situation but theres nothing i can do
you just called the wrong person is all
im sure theres some fine horse doctors
back east
no but i dont want a horse doctor

with you and your horse
well but you see its not my horse

summer dresses or shorts
oh yeah of course of course

that dirty son of a bitch
well youre the closest
anyones ever gotten

a long trip for nothin
but before i even think about it
i need to know somethin right now
and its a question for grace
you see when i work with a horse
its no good just me doin it
the owners gotta be involved too
well thatll be a little complicated
you can make it as complicated
or as easy as you like

be ridin him am i right
hey right

i dont know that i can do anything
but im prepared to give it a go

i said what do i have to do
well what does she want
does she want you to take care
of her horse
somethin like that
and theyre stayin in a motel
the lazy j
can i have some butter please
not exactly a tourist stop
well well what about the girl
doesnt she go to school
i dont know
you know i just think shes got
a lot of nerve showin up here
draggin that you know poor animal
and that child all the way
honey dont eat with your fingers
frank dont you think
shes got a lot of nerve
well hell i dont know according to
tom shes a pretty determined woman
she mustve thought it was worth it
yeah well i guess theyll want
feedin bein out here all day long
i dont think theyll expect that
what they gonna drive 40 miles into
town every time they want a hamburger
mixed salad
what
well i believe women from new york
eat mixed salads
aint that right tom
i believe so
well thats just what we need
a vegetarian from new york
on our cattle ranch
a great traveller interested
not merely a good one
is a kind of introspective
as she covers the ground outwardly
so she advances towards fresh
interpretations of herself inwardly
and this is the quality
which lends frea starksbooks
the memorable poetic density
which is their special cachet
moreover it is this quality
which makes them as fresh and strike
youre at a good place to quit
oh i got him movin out a bit
thats about it
its still a long ways away
from gettin a leg over him
well were movin along
whats he doing
is this some kind
of physical therapy
hello hello
what no youre breaking up
hold on hold on
dont start a fight with him
joey give me your rope
just to pull him back
well never get him outta there
let me go in after him
mr booker im really not comfortable
with you taking these kind of risks
oh god
hey hey pilgrim
let him go
let him go
does that hurt you
only when i kick somebody
dont you go to school
taking a break
dont you
school terms out early for us
so we can work the ranch
look at him out in the pasture
he mustve been a big
beautifullookin horse
how was he to ride
excuse me
ive got chores to look after
are we in the way
should we leave
i guess well go then
from now on
leave your phone somewhere else
miss maclean would you and
your daughter like to stay for dinner
joe take off your hat at the table
i dont want to say it again
uh dear lord
we are humbly thankful
for these gifts
for the blessings on our home
our family and our guests
and bless those that arent
as fortunate
bless all gods creatures amen
amen
amen
like some roast beef
looks great thanks
thank you
want some milk
yeah thanks
ol hank got us
a couple more men
to move the cattle
and what kind of cattle
do you raise mr booker
well we run a mixed herd
but mostly black baldies
and uh whatre whatre those
black angus herefords
instead of straight herefords
oh black angus
there you go
of course
and uh whats
whats the difference
well they suit the weather better
and their utters are black
instead of pink
they dont get burnt
with the sun bouncin off the snow
they make good mothers
our daddy raised straight herefords
you know thats interesting um
ive always wondered every time i
you know when i go into a restaurant
whats the difference between a regular
steak and a black angus steak
i can never taste the difference
but i could swear that one
was more tender than the other
i didnt know there was
that much difference between the cows
of course ive never been on
a cow farm before
seems to me that the bulls
have the best of the time
just laying around the fields
waiting for somebody to come along
and ask them to do their work
you get born a bull
got a 90 chance of getting castrated
served up as hamburger
so on balance
i reckon id choose being a cow
yeah
hey young man
you get back up to bed
so hows the lazy j
holding up for you
oh its fine
i still cant get used to how dark
it gets around here though
every time i leave the ranch
i hold my breath
until i can see the motel
well by golly
thats a lot of drive time
you know tom while youre working
on that horse of theirs
annie and grace should move
into the old creek house
nobodys usin it its silly for her
to be driving back and forth
when she she dont know her way around
that well
well thats very kind of you
but really were fine where we are
oh hell look
i know the lazy j
whole place is as good
as falling down around your ears
frank theyre already
all settled in
and anyway im sure
they want their privacy
well its got doors diane
and private as can be
tom
i dont have a problem with it
i think its up to annie
well itd be great for when my dad
comes to visit
where is your dad honey
hes at home working
you know um i dont know um
is it worth it really i mean
how long do you think youll carry on
working with pilgrim
that depends on pilgrim
i know me too
when are you comin to visit
yeah well therell be plenty of room
cause were moving down to the ranch
yeah yeah theyve got this really cute
little house down by the creek
its really pretty
okay okay
i love you too
hohold on
dad wants to talk to you
hi
well she sounds like
shes doing all right how is she
yeah
you know i think she seems
to be getting more comfortable
on the ranch
which is which is the only reason
i said yes to this move
well that makes sense
so how are you doing out there
in marlboro country
is the magazine complaining at all
yeah but nothing i cant handle
lucy says she thinks gottschalks
plotting but what else is new hmm

i think its time you started earning
your keep around here

id like you to help out
with the horses you know

thats not a question is it
nope
okay
hey cowboy
when i was out walkin
one morning for pleasure
spied a cowpuncher
come alopinalong
his hat was throwed back
and his spurs was ajinglin
and as he approached
he was singinthis song
hey you little ones
how are you
he was only 1 8 he had a flat
on his little pickup and
you know youre not allowed
to go swimming in the river
and marie here made the best pie
cherry pie go get some
as luck would have it he didnt have
all the lug nuts off
but the jack slipped and fell
right on that rock he calls a head
is he okay
well it rearranged his scalp
about 1 2 inches
but he always dreamed of having a place
where he could raise horses
and have a whole separate life
my grandson joe is named for him
and somebody told him
about a place called stockett
he got on his horse
and he rode over there
and he got off and he walked
as far as he could one way
and then he turned around and he
walked as far as he could to the other
and then he decided that
thats where he was going to settle
and thats where we raised
frank and tommy
where do you call home
shes from new york mom
um
well i was born in london
but im from all over really
my father was a diplomat
and so we moved constantly
oh my
that sounds very important
no
no he was he was a wonderful man
he died when i was 1 2 but we
we lived all over the world
we its its not the same as
as knowing a place like this
well sometimes people carry it
more on the inside

hey grace
what went on out there with pilgrim
see grace i got a problem
when i work with a horse
i like to know its history
now most of the times a horse
in its own way can pretty much
tell you the whole story
but sometimes they get
so messed up in their head
that you need more to go on
now i dont know how you feel
about talkin about it
and if you dont feel like it
i understand
but if im gonna figure out
whats goin on in his head
sure would help me if i understood
exactly what happened that day
you know not today
whenever you feel like it
ill leave that up to you
uhoh

yeah
you wanna pick it up a little
yeah
watch your reins
give him some room
let him do the work
okay you okay
yep
lets go
i envy your mother
i do
it must be great to be her age
and to be at the point in life
when you have no more guesswork
no more impossible decisions to make
and anyway it doesnt matter
because all the worries
and all the wrong turns that you made
are as valuable and as as
as cherished as the things
that you did right
i
oh it must be such a relief
must be such peace in that
well i dont think you have to wait to
be her age to find that kind of peace
yeah but how would you know
unless it was all behind you
do you have it
sometimes not all the time
but sometimes
when
wakin up on the ranch in the morning
knowin what im supposed to do
that day
knowing im home
i wake up every morning and
i dont know a damn thing was i
was i right to bring her here
away from whats familiar
away from her father her friends
and the more i try and fix things
the more everything falls apart
maybe you should let em fall
no i cant
why
do you think i was right to come
i cant answer that annie
well ill know soon enough
if ive made a mistake
gracell let me know
shes a strong kid
she gets that from somebody
thank you for all youre doing
you and your family
letting us stay at the house
it wasnt gettin much use
what was your wife like
she had reddish hair
not not quite almost
depended on the light
she had green eyes
and when she played that was it
something just went right through me
id never heard music like that
played before
and the way she looked
when she played it
and then one day she looked at me
that way and that was it
for both of us
i knew she didnt want
to be a ranchers wife
but i wanted to give it a try
i thought maybe she could
give music lessons to the kids
in town the school maybe
and that our kids would grow up with
my brothers kids and play together
but she wasnt happy here
too much space she said
so why didnt you stay in chicago
wasnt enough space
it just wasnt meant to be
but how did you know for sure
knowings the easy part
saying it out louds the hard part
mmm seems so obvious now
doesnt it
we werent right for each other
if only we knew then
i didnt love her
cause it was right
i just loved her
for whatever its worth annie
took a lot of guts for you to come here
lift your leg

and id be all alone and
and but ive got you
i used to pray every night
that you and dad
would have another kid
so i wouldnt have to be
so uh special
i i know
and i know how how hard it must be
to have lost your best friend
and have your body be different
than from how youd like it to be
but one day somebody will look
at this extraordinary woman
that youre becoming and
all theyll see
is how much they love you
thats all i see
yep
hello this is a t t
conference service
is this annie maclean
yes
i have a conference call scheduled
for you with mr gottschalk
and mr felton
mr felton
hold on please
okay im ready
ive been waiting for you
to come back
are you hungry
judith was um
telling me about this boy
i never even got his name
we were gonna go around
the railroad bridge
we were laughing about something
i dont know what
and um her horse fell
and judiths foot
was caught in the stirrup
and she was so scared
and next i saw this truck
coming around the turn
and it was honking
trying to get us to move
and i ii tried
to grab her reins and
to get her horse
to move out of the way
and the truck started to skid
and ththere was no time
to do anything
it ran right into judith and
and she just disappeared
and then it came
at pilgrim and me
and pilgrim reared up
at the truck
and i fell off
but judith
oh godjudith
im so sorryjudith
grace
now im not gonna tell ya
its gonna stop feelin this bad
but i will tell you
you didnt do anything wrong
the same thing
couldve happened to me
or to frank or to joey
and it doesnt make any sense
to try to figure out
why these things happen
there was a boy from
the blackfeet reservation
he used to do some work around here
for a while
sixteen strong kid good kid
he and i were
really really good friends
one day he went swimmin
and dove headfirst into the lake
and right into a rock
and it snapped his neck
paralysed him
and after the accident
id look in on him
from time to time
but he wasnt there
it was like his mind his spirit
whatever you want to call it
just disappeared
the only thing left
was just anger
just sort of as if the
the boy i once knew
just went somewhere else
i know where he goes
i know you do
dont you disappear
you do whatever you have to do
to hold on
ill tell you one more thing
you know when pilgrim
reared up against that truck
you know what i think
i think that damned horse
loved you so much
he was tryin to protect you
thats what i think
how did you get like this
no no no get up
let me show you
wanna see it again
yep
can you do it without smiling
yep
no you cant not possible
i can feel the muscles right
try me
i can feel the muscles right
must be nice to have a few days
off work huh
yeah yeah
its more than a few days though
im not an editor anymore
first time i said it out loud
they fired ya
no no its more like a
yeah they fired me
you dont seem too upset about it
delayed shock
or maybe not
im sure i can talk my way back in there
or get another magazine someplace
but maybe i dont well im just
not sure i im not sure i want to
well i guess you dont have
to figure it out till you get home
see when you hit like a windmill
yeah
its not gonna do any good
but if you hit down
like you can hit a golf club
come back down
down into it
did you always know
this is the life you wanted
well i was a ranchers daughter
i guess its not too far to go
to becomin a ranchers wife yeah
yeah franks a good man
oh they dont come better
i dont deny there are times i think
about all the things i wont have
maybe ill get to see morocco
probably not
did tom have many girlfriends
after his divorce
hey look annie
im not good at this sort of talk
goes around and round somethin
and never gets to it
so lets just say what it is
tom means so much to this family
dont you go lookin here
for whatever it is youre lookin for
dont make that man go through
somethin that took him so long
to see his way clear of
in the first place
i dont think tom would do anything
he didnt want to do
yeah hes a good man
ooh hes got a gift
comes from heaven above i swear
but hes still just a man
bitter raindrops glisten
on the painted injun flower
honey child the mornin

1 21 5
the bookers want to leave
for the airport by 930

well i already know the way and its
not like i have a job to rush home to
to tell you the truth
i could use the time alone
when are you planning to start
oh i guess ill leave
when you and grace go
may i make a suggestion
what
take your time
whats the matter
you look like theres something wrong
ill tell you something annie
i stood there looking at that horse
and i swear i felt like the same thing
was happening to me
and i have two choices
i can either fight
the way things are
or accept them
see um
i always knew i loved you more
didnt bother me
i guess i felt kind of lucky
a little amazed that
a woman like you would want to be
with a man like me
and i guess i thought if i could
do everything right if i could
if i was the best husband i could be
the best father
even even being
a good lawyer only mattered
because of what it meant for us
if i could do all that
it wouldnt make any difference
if we loved each other the same or not
i didnt ask for more
i told myself i didnt need any more
but
the truth is you dont know
how you feel about me
you dont know if you want
a life with me anymore
and the truth is
i dont want you to come home
until you do know
one way or the other
okay
thanksjoe
