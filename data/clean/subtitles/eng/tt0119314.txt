  a million years before man   
  they grazed the vast
and empty plains   
  living by voices
only they could hear 
  they first came to know man
as the hunted knows the hunter   
  for long before he used horses
for his labours   
  he killed them for meat 
  the alliance with man
would forever be fragile   
  for the fear he d struck
into their hearts   
  was too deep to be dislodged 
  since that neolithic moment   
  when a horse was first haltered   
  there were those among men
who understood this 
  they could see
into the creature s soul   
  and soothe the wounds
they found there 
  the secrets uttered softly
into troubled ears 
these men were known
as the whisperers   
it s perfectly shot 
perfectly cropped   
perfectly laid out 
and i am so bloody bored 
start again 
thank you 
would you excuse me for a moment 
yes 
  hello 
  yeah  this is tom booker 
i got a message you called 
oh  hello  mr booker 
it s annie maclean from cover 
you know  the magazine 
um  well  thank you
for returning my call 
  is there something
i can do for you  ma am 
  yes  yes 
i read this article about what you do
for people with horse problems 
well  truth is  i help horses
with people problems 
well  whichever way
you want to put it 
uh  this article said that you were 
you were a  a horse whisperer 
oh  they said that  huh 
a whisperer  hmm 
and i was hoping that you d come
to new york   
and take a look at my daughter s horse
and possibly do some  
ma am  i m sorry  but i m 
i m afraid you ve misunderstood
whatever it is you read 
because that s not exactly what i do 
i mostly conduct clinics  you see  and  
well  could you come to new york
just for the day 
  it s only a few hours by plane 
  and i m not doin  them now 
i m on my way to montana where i have
a ranch to take care of 
well  i d pay your fare  of course 
uh  first class 
ma am  first class to montana
is a waste of good money 
well  if you could just give me a time
when you d be available 
say  am i  am i being too polite here
when i say   no   in nevada 
does that mean   yes   where you are 
look  i m really sorry for your
situation  but there s nothing i can do 
you just called the wrong person is all 
i m sure there s some fine horse doctors
back east 
no  but i don t want a horse doctor 
  i want  i want you 
  so i  i hope everything goes okay
with you and your horse 
  well  but you see  it s not my horse 
  so  so  goodbye now 
grace 
grace  it s mom 
grace 
grace 
are you all right 
  i ve decided about pilgrim 
  oh

  maybe they should put me down  too 
  what 
  i m not much use anymore 
you re getting a fax 
  you re up late

just louder this time  that s all 
  so why d you go 
  well  one of us had to 
they re still our friends  annie 
listen  i had a thought 
what do you think
we go someplace warm  the three of us 
bermuda or the bahamas or  
what 
mmm  nothing 
no  i just don t know if bermuda
would be such a good idea 
  grace would have to wear
summer dresses or shorts 
  oh  yeah  of course  of course 
what is it 
i want to take pilgrim out to see this
horse guy  drive him out to montana 
  no  i m serious

  well  i m not asking you to 
i ll do it 
  by yourself  how 
  you can t take care of pilgrim

  i do know a thing or two about horses 
  what about the magazine 
i m in charge 
i can oversee things from montana 
  i can take my fax  my computer 
  oh  you re in charge 
well  what about grace  the doctor says
she needs stability and security 
well  i can t say he s being
all that effective with her 
  are you a psychiatrist 
he says it takes time 
  well  i don t care what he says 
i cannot sit here and pretend
everything s gonna be all right 
  i am not pretending  i am trusting 
  we have to do something  robert 
  other people know more
about this than we do 
  we are losing   we are losing her 
i don t care what the doctors say 
they don t know her 
i don t care
if this doesn t sound rational 
nobody is suggesting anything better 
i  i can t explain it  robert 
i just have this feeling 
i just know it s the right thing 
why  annie 
i just know it 
does this  uh  cowboy vet
know that you re coming 
yeah 
what if grace doesn t wanna go 
she will if you think she should 
  and you think it s best

i don t wanna go 
straight back  come on 
a little closer  a little more 
watch it  get behind him 
hold it  get back  hold it 
  watch it 
  there he goes  eddie 
  why don t you get inside and  
  lady  we re doing the best we can

  maybe we should give him
another sedative 
  we did 
get the gate  get the gate 
let s get out of here 
hold that door

honey  don t eat with your fingers 
frank  don t you think

tom  she s a pretty determined woman 
she must ve thought it was worth it 
yeah  well  i guess they ll want
feedin   bein  out here all day long 
  i don t think they ll expect that 
  what  they gonna drive 40 miles into
town every time they want a hamburger 
  mixed salad 
  what 
well  i believe women from new york
eat mixed salads 
  ain t that right  tom 
  i believe so 
well  that s just what we need 
a vegetarian from new york
on our cattle ranch 
a great traveller  interested 
not merely a good one   
is a kind of introspective 
as she covers the ground outwardly   
so she advances towards fresh
interpretations of herself  inwardly 
and this is the quality
which lends frea starks books   
the memorable poetic density
which is their special cachet 
moreover  it is this quality
which makes them as fresh and strike  
you re at a good place to quit 
oh  i got him movin  out a bit 
that s about it 
it s still a long ways away
from gettin  a leg over him 
well  we re movin  along 
what s he doing 
is this some kind
of physical therapy 
hello  hello 
what  no  you re breaking up 
hold on  hold on 
don t start a fight with him 
joey  give me your rope 
just to pull him back 
we ll never get him outta there 
let me go in after him 
mr booker  i m really not comfortable
with you taking these kind of risks 
  oh  god 
  hey  hey  pilgrim 
let him go 
let him go 
does that hurt you 
only when i kick somebody 
don t you go to school 
taking a break 
don t you 
school term s out early for us
so we can work the ranch 
look at him out in the pasture 
he must ve been a big 
beautiful lookin  horse 
how was he to ride 
excuse me 
i ve got chores to look after 
are we in the way 
should we leave 
i guess we ll go then 
from now on 
leave your phone somewhere else 
miss maclean  would you and
your daughter like to stay for dinner 
joe  take off your hat at the table 
i don t want to say it again 
uh  dear lord   
we are humbly thankful
for these gifts   
for the blessings on our home 
our family and our guests 
and bless those that aren t
as fortunate 
bless all god s creatures  amen 
  amen 
  amen 
  like some roast beef 
  looks great  thanks 
thank you 
  want some milk 
  yeah  thanks 
ol  hank got us
a couple more men   
to move the cattle 
and what kind of cattle
do you raise  mr booker 
well  we run a mixed herd 
but mostly black baldies 
and  uh  what re  what re those 
  black angus herefords
instead of straight herefords 
  oh  black angus 
  there you go 
  of course 
and  uh  what s 
what s the difference 
  well  they suit the weather better 
  and their utters are black
instead of pink 
they don t get burnt
with the sun bouncin  off the snow 
  they make good mothers 
  our daddy raised straight herefords 
you know  that s interesting  um  
i ve always wondered every time i 
you know  when i go into a restaurant   
what s the difference between a regular
steak and a black angus steak 
i can never taste the difference 
but i could swear that one
was more tender than the other 
i didn t know there was
that much difference between the cows 
of course  i ve never been on
a cow farm before 
seems to me that the bulls
have the best of the time 
just laying around the fields 
waiting for somebody to come along
and ask them to do their work 
you get born a bull 
got a 90  chance of getting castrated 
served up as hamburger 
so on balance 
i reckon i d choose being a cow 
yeah 
  hey  young man 
  you get back up to bed 
so how s the lazy   j  
holding up for you 
oh  it s fine 
i still can t get used to how dark
it gets around here  though 
every time i leave the ranch 
i hold my breath
until i can see the motel 
well  by golly 
that s a lot of drive time 
you know  tom  while you re working
on that horse of theirs   
annie and grace should move
into the old creek house 
nobody s usin  it  it s silly for her
to be driving back and forth   
when she  she don t know her way around
that well 
well  that s very kind of you 
but really we re fine where we are 
oh  hell  look 
i know the lazy   j   
whole place is as good
as falling down around your ears 
frank  they re already
all settled in 
and anyway  i m sure
they want their privacy 
well  it s got doors  diane 
and private as can be 
tom 
i don t have a problem with it 
i think it s up to annie 
well  it d be great for when my dad
comes to visit 
where is your dad  honey 
he s at home  working 
you know  um   i don t know  um  
is it worth it  really  i mean 
how long do you think you ll carry on
working with pilgrim 
that depends on pilgrim 
i know  me  too 
when are you comin  to visit 
yeah  well  there ll be plenty of room
 cause we re moving down to the ranch 
yeah  yeah  they ve got this really cute
little house down by the creek 
it s really pretty 
okay  okay 
i love you  too 
ho hold on 
dad wants to talk to you 
hi 
  well  she sounds like
she s doing all right  how is she 
  yeah 
you know  i think she seems
to be getting more comfortable
on the ranch   
which is  which is the only reason
i said yes to this move 
well  that makes sense 
so  how are you doing out there
in marlboro country 
  is the magazine complaining at all 
  yeah  but nothing i can t handle 
lucy says she thinks gottschalk s
plotting  but what else is new  hmm 
so when are you coming home 
you know  i asked him that myself
tonight  and he doesn t know 
hmm  i miss you  annie 
yeah  i know 
we miss you  too 
  good night 
   night 
did you ask him to come visit 
you already did 
do you want me to help you pack 
  hi 
  howdy 
what s he doing 
he s tryin  go get him
to hook on 
how s it going 
get over there 
ha  come on 
hey  you over there 
wanna make yourself useful 
  hey  hank 
  yeah 
i think you got a volunteer here 
you wanna take care of her 
where s grace  grace 
  you okay 
  yeah 
  cocktail hour yet 
  what 
i said  is it cocktail hour yet 
come here a second 
you handled that pretty well 
i think it s time you started earning
your keep around here 
so when we re not working 
you re not doing your therapy   
i d like you to help out
with the horses  you know 
rubbin  them  cleanin  the stalls 
think you can handle that 
  that s not a question  is it 
  nope 
okay 
hey  cowboy 
when i was out walkin 
one morning for pleasure
spied a cowpuncher
come a lopin along
his hat was throwed back
and his spurs was a jinglin 
and as he approached
he was singin this song
hey  you little ones 
how are you 
he was only 1 8  he had a flat
on his little pickup  and  
you know you re not allowed
to go swimming in the river 
and marie here made the best pie 
cherry pie  go get some 
as luck would have it  he didn t have
all the lug nuts off   
but the jack slipped and fell
right on that rock he calls a head 
is he okay 
well  it rearranged his scalp
about 1 2 inches  
but he always dreamed of having a place
where he could raise horses   
and have a whole separate life 
my grandson joe is named for him 
and somebody told him
about a place called stockett 
he got on his horse
and he rode over there   
and he got off  and he walked
as far as he could one way 
and then he turned around  and he
walked as far as he could to the other 
and then he decided that
that s where he was going to settle 
and that s where we raised
frank and tommy 
  where do you call home 
  she s from new york  mom 
um  
well  i was born in london 
but i m from all over really 
my father was a diplomat 
and so we moved constantly 
oh  my 
that sounds very important 
no 
no  he was  he was a wonderful man 
he died when i was 1 2  but we 
we lived all over the world 
we   it s  it s not the same as 
as knowing a place like this 
well  sometimes people carry it
more on the inside   
than the outside 
if it hadn t have been
for them troublesome doggies  
i suppose i could gather up
some of these cups and plates 
  you guys done with these 
  yeah 
you better give me that recipe 
it was really  
i know  i know 
be glad to tell her anything 
this family has quite a history 
yeah  it s a story  all right 
  i love how she calls him tommy 
  yeah  always did 
i think she always favoured him 
she loves tellin  this story about   
when he was two years old 
he ran off   
and they found him sleepin 
in the barn   
between two giant hooves
of a percheron stallion 
he said that horse was protectin  him 
and nobody could convince him otherwise 
why do you always wear that hat 
 cause it fits my head 
  wanna try it on 
  come on 
what do you want me to do 
what do you want me to do 
huh  what 
what do you call that 
okay  one more time 
you gonna  you gonna sit on me  here 
so you can watch this  cause i don t
wanna do this too many times  okay 
put your finger up  okay 
okay  loop s knotted  right 
looks like the only way to get it off
is to break the touch  right 
now watch 
you watchin  
watch careful 
  again  again 
  again  again  one more time 
oh  no  no  i don t fall
for that one twice 
now  you guys get on in
before your mother calls you 
  here 
  so  
thank you 
  what 
  do you ever sit still
for just a minute 
well  you sit still too long
in new york and you get renovated 
why is it  mr booker 
that sometimes i get the feeling
that you re laughing at me 
i don t know  why 
no  you re supposed to say
you re not laughing at me 
oh  i see  you take care of both sides
of the conversation  do you 
it s a man s world  mr booker 
most women have to 
you can call me tom 
maybe i am laughin  a little bit 
i figure since you re here  it might
be nice to relax into the place a bit 
yeah 
well  it s beautiful country 
and i could see having
some kind of a   
you know  vacation place  retreat 
but i don t know how you do it
full time 
don t you miss
the rest of the world 
what s there to miss 
well  if you ve never lived
in a city with   
with museums and theatre and   
and restaurants and music   
uh  well  i can t explain 
well  does chicago count 
  you lived in chicago 
  that s where i met my wife 
you  you were  you were married
to a woman in chicago 
yeah  really  a woman 
no  i m sorry  i didn t  i didn t  
no  i m so  
i was studying engineering   
and she was studying music 
the cello 
and i once heard her play
a dvorak concerto   
and i thought it was
the most beautiful piece of music
i d ever heard in my life 
so  just who s laughin  at who here 
jogger  huh 
i don t jog  mr booker  i run 
well  that s lucky for you 
grizzlies around here

but the house is fine  yeah 
oop  i have a way with animals 
that s all right 
he s just young

well  there s only one way to find out 
now  put it in   d   
now give it some gas 
okay  we know you can 
now you just gotta feel how much

there you go 
nice

up at the end here  turn onto it 
now just follow this 
nothin  to it 
i m gonna kinda close my eyes here
for a little while   
so keep goin 
till you run out of road 
uh  i  i  i don t think i can 
it s not a question if you can 
you are 
where d you get pilgrim from 
we bought him in kentucky 
me and my mom took a trip down there
to see him 
well  that must ve been special 
yeah 
are you afraid of anything  tom booker 
oh  growin  old 
not bein  much use 
hey  grace 
what went on out there with pilgrim 
see  grace  i got a problem 
when i work with a horse 
i like to know its history 
now most of the times  a horse 
in its own way  can pretty much
tell you the whole story   
but sometimes they get
so messed up in their head
that you need more to go on 
now  i don t know how you feel
about talkin  about it   
and if you don t feel like it 
i understand 
but if i m gonna figure out
what s goin  on in his head   
sure would help me if i understood
exactly what happened that day 
you know  not today 
whenever you feel like it 
i ll leave that up to you 
uh oh 
  the answer s no 
  you haven t even heard
the question yet 
now  the truth is 
you d be doin  me a real favour 
i got all these young colts
that need ridin   rimrock here  he s  
  i mean  he s feelin  kinda left out 
  poor thing 
he d be grateful 
and he d take real good care with you 
  is this how you re gonna make me pay
my phone bill 
  no  no  ma am 
that part s extra 
oh  brought you a hat 
  oh  i have a hat 
  i know  i ve seen it 
  i think my stirrups are too long  or  
  no  they re fine 
just relax your centre 
  yeah 
 just sittin  in a bucket 
well  it s all coming back  you know 
i mean  i ll be fine 
okay  well  then
i ll stop talkin  then 
no  i didn t mean that  i   you know 
i ve never ridden western before 
  so  
  yeah  but he doesn t know that 
just sit the horse 
  yeah 
  you have a nice seat 
you re doin  fine 
thank you 
  you look good  you feel okay 
  yeah 
  you wanna pick it up a little 
  yeah 
watch your reins 
give him some room 
let him do the work 
  okay  you okay 
  yep 
let s go 
i envy your mother 
i do 
it must be great to be her age   
and to be at the point in life
when you have no more guesswork 
no more impossible decisions to make 
and anyway  it doesn t matter
because all the worries
and all the wrong turns that you made   
are as valuable and as  as   
as cherished as the things
that you did right 
i  
oh  it must be such a relief 
must be such peace in that 
well  i don t think you have to wait to
be her age to find that kind of peace 
yeah  but how would you know
unless it was all behind you 
do you have it 
sometimes  not all the time 
but sometimes 
when 
wakin  up on the ranch in the morning 
knowin  what i m supposed to do
that day 
knowing i m home 
i wake up every morning  and
i don t know a damn thing  was i  
was i right to bring her here 
away from what s familiar   
away from her father  her friends 
and the more i try and fix things 
the more everything falls apart 
maybe you should let  em fall 
  no  i can t 
  why 
do you think i was right to come 
i can t answer that  annie 
well  i ll know soon enough 
if i ve made a mistake 
grace ll let me know 
she s a strong kid 
she gets that from somebody 
thank you for all you re doing 
you and your family 
letting us stay at the house 
it wasn t gettin  much use 
what was your wife like 
she had reddish hair 
not  not quite  almost 
depended on the light 
she had green eyes 
and when she played  that was it 
something just went right through me 
i d never heard music like that
played before 
and the way she looked
when she played it 
and then one day  she looked at me
that way  and that was it   
for both of us 
i knew she didn t want
to be a rancher s wife 
but i wanted to give it a try 
i thought maybe she could
give music lessons to the kids
in town  the school maybe   
and that our kids would grow up with
my brother s kids and play together 
but she wasn t happy here 
  too much space    she said 
  so why didn t you stay in chicago 
  wasn t enough space 
it just wasn t meant to be 
but how did you know  for sure 
knowing s the easy part 
saying it out loud s the hard part 
mmm  seems so obvious now 
doesn t it 
  we weren t right for each other 
if only we knew then   
i didn t love her
 cause it was right 
i just loved her 
for whatever it s worth  annie 
took a lot of guts for you to come here 
lift your leg 
come on  come on 
hey joe 
hi 
would you let me ride your horse 
  have you talked to tom about it 
  of course i have 
i don t know

what you re feeling 
when i was your age 
and when my  when my dad died   
i d felt like i d lost everything
and i d be all alone  and  
and   but i ve got you 
i used to pray every night   
that you and dad
would have another kid   
so i wouldn t have to be
so  uh  special 
i  i know 
and i know how  how hard it must be
to have lost your best friend   
and have your body be different
than from how you d like it to be 
but one day  somebody will look
at this extraordinary woman
that you re becoming and   
all they ll see
is how much they love you 
that s all i see 
  yep 
  hello  this is a t  t
conference service 
  is this annie maclean 
  yes 
i have a conference call scheduled
for you with mr gottschalk
and mr felton 
mr felton 
hold on  please 
okay  i m ready 
i ve been waiting for you
to come back 
are you hungry 
judith was  um 
telling me about this boy 
i never even got his name 
we were gonna go around
the railroad bridge 
we were laughing about something 
i don t know what 
and  um  her horse fell   
and judith s foot
was caught in the stirrup 
and she was so scared 
and next i saw this truck
coming around the turn 
and it was honking 
trying to get us to move 
and i  i i tried
to grab her reins and   
to get her horse
to move out of the way 
and the truck started to skid 
and th there was no time
to do anything 
it ran right into judith  and  
and she just disappeared 
and then it came
at pilgrim and me 
and pilgrim reared up
at the truck 
and i fell off 
but judith  
oh  god judith 
  i m so sorry judith 
  grace 
now  i m not gonna tell ya
it s gonna stop feelin  this bad 
but i will tell you
you didn t do anything wrong 
the same thing
could ve happened to me   
or to frank or to joey 
and it doesn t make any sense
to try to figure out
why these things happen 
there was a boy from
the blackfeet reservation 
he used to do some work around here
for a while 
sixteen  strong kid  good kid 
he and i were
really  really good friends 
one day he went swimmin 
and dove headfirst into the lake   
and right into a rock 
and it snapped his neck 
paralysed him 
and after the accident   
i d look in on him
from time to time 
but he wasn t there 
it was like his mind  his spirit 
whatever you want to call it 
just disappeared 
the only thing left
was just anger 
just sort of as if the   
the boy i once knew
just went somewhere else 
i know where he goes 
i know you do 
don t you disappear 
you do whatever you have to do
to hold on 
i ll tell you one more thing 
you know when pilgrim
reared up against that truck 
you know what i think 
i think that damned horse
loved you so much
he was tryin  to protect you 
that s what i think 
  how did you get like this 
  no  no  no  get up 
let me show you 
  wanna see it again 
  yep 
  can you do it without smiling 
  yep 
no  you can t  not possible 
i can feel the muscles right  
  try me 
  i can feel the muscles right  
must be nice to have a few days
off work  huh 
yeah  yeah 
it s more than a few days  though 
i m not an editor anymore 
  first time i said it out loud 
  they fired ya 
no  no  it s more like a  
yeah  they fired me 
  you don t seem too upset about it 
  delayed shock 
or maybe not 
i m sure i can talk my way back in there
or get another magazine someplace 
but maybe i don t   well  i m just
not sure i   i m not sure i want to 
well  i guess you don t have
to figure it out till you get home 
  see  when you hit like a windmill   
  yeah 
it s not gonna do any good 
but if you hit down 
like you can hit a golf club   
come back down 
down into it 
did you always know
this is the life you wanted 
well  i was a rancher s daughter 
i guess it s not too far to go
to becomin  a rancher s wife  yeah 
yeah  frank s a good man 
oh  they don t come better 
i don t deny there are times i think
about all the things i won t have 
maybe i ll get to see morocco 
probably not 
did tom have many girlfriends
after his divorce 
hey  look  annie 
i m not good at this sort of talk 
goes around and round somethin

i don t think tom would do anything

yeah  he s a good man 
ooh  he s got a gift

but he s still just a man 
bitter raindrops glisten
on the painted injun flower

and this  this nice  uh  older gentleman
with a bandage on his head   
uh  gave me directions 
  sweet jesus  that s henry vanoker 
  oh 
i m surprised you didn t wind up
in mexico 
well  once when  uh  dad was in india 
he  he got lost   
way  way up in these mountains 
and when he finally found his way back 
everyone said that he had discovered
a new route 
and they redid all the maps 
well  now how d you end up
in india  robert 
oh  this is right after college 
i was in the peace corps 
well  that s where he met mom 
hey  tell  em about when  uh 
mom went looking for tubab 
  no  honey  i  
  oh  dad  come on  dad 
uh  well  mom was a writer 
and  um  dad knows the rest 
  come on 
  she was a journalist
for an english periodical 
  uh  what was it called 
  cambridge monthly 
right  and she decided to go to india
all by herself without knowing a soul 
uh  she had no place to stay  but
she was  she was told to look up tubab 
  tubab 
  she comes to my door   
suitcase and typewriter   
and asks where tubab is 
and i said    right here   
and she said    you re tubab   
i said    no  my name is robert 
tubab means white man 
and yes  i am   
and that was how we met 
small bed 
maybe i should sleep in the barn 
you re allergic to hay 
i  i apologize
for the surprise 
  but the days only opened yesterday 
and i figured that  
  you don t have to apologize 
you have every right to be here 
you were right to bring her here 
well  there ve been plenty of times
i wasn t so sure 
must be tired  huh 
yeah

daylight has found me
here again
you can ask me anything
but where i ve been
you should know the reason
why i called
i was lookin for
a soft place to fall
lookin for a soft place
nothin more than
a small taste
of a love that ended
long ago
lookin for a place to hide
a warm bed on a cold night
i didn t mean to hurt you
no  no  no
lookin out your window
at the dawn
baby  when you wake up
i ll be gone

after all
how to find a soft place
to fall
  the summer is really very brief

yeah 
can you tell that to your family 
to robert  to grace

neither of you is gonna need me anymore 
and we re there 
i m not askin  
put your leg over the saddle here 
that a girl 
now  we re gonna rock him up 
oh 
  dad 
  honey  you were wonderful 
hey there  gettin  ready
to go home  are ya 
mm hmm  is tom around 
no  he went to sheridan to get
some horses  he left last night 
um  when s he coming back 
oh  i don t rightly know 
let me know when you need some help
loadin  pilgrim  okay 
yeah 
  what time s your flight 
  1 2 1 5 
the bookers want to leave
for the airport by 9 30 
sure you want to drive pilgrim back 
well  i already know the way  and it s
not like i have a job to rush home to 
to tell you the truth 
i could use the time alone 
  when are you planning to start 
  oh  i guess i ll leave
when you and grace go 
may i make a suggestion 
what 
take your time 
what s the matter 
you look like there s something wrong 
i ll tell you something  annie 
i stood there looking at that horse 
and i swear i felt like the same thing
was happening to me 
and i have two choices 
i can either fight
the way things are   
or accept them 
see  um   
i always knew i loved you more 
didn t bother me 
i guess i felt kind of lucky 
a little amazed that   
a woman like you would want to be
with a man like me 
and i guess i thought if i could
do everything right   if i could  
if i was the best husband i could be 
the best father   
even  even being
a good lawyer only mattered
because of what it meant for us 
if i could do all that   
it wouldn t make any difference
if we loved each other the same or not 
i didn t ask for more 
i told myself i didn t need any more 
but   
the truth is  you don t know
how you feel about me 
you don t know if you want
a life with me anymore 
and the truth is   
i don t want you to come home
until you do know   
one way or the other 
okay 
  thanks joe 
  yep 
goodbye  annie 
good luck to ya 
thank you  and  and you  too

to say goodbye

not too good at hellos either

  when will you be home
