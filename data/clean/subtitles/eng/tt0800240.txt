music
i just saw this in my inbox
its for you
i guess it came in a little
while ago by messenger
thank you
wyatt pay attention jonathan
this is what youre gonna do
look for a group of subaccounts
in the lieblingholloway trust
these are masked accounts
48 separate line items
with iban numbers ending with 6700
you bundle these phantom accounts
and set up a standard wire transfer
to the banco nationale madrid
an accounts already been
set up in your name
clutenichols is
very particular about
who accesses their
private holding accounts
but you have a
level four clearance
and thats why youre
my friend remember
at exactly 5 oclock youre gonna log in
and begin a global fund exchange
once youre inside youre gonna
access the lieblingholloway trust
through rudolph holloways
private account
youll only have 40 minutes
to locate the private trust accounts
and manually consolidate all balances
into a single fund wire
once youre done youll encode
this fund wire for an endofday transfer
to the clutenichols office in hong kong
the asian market
opens 15 hours ahead of us
thus this transfer will be catalogued
as fridays business
and wont flag on the clute transfer log
until end of business monday
thats four days after
were done jonathan
thats plenty of time for me
to fill out a withdrawal slip in spain
