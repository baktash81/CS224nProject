downstairs  you talked about a rule 
are there others 
no rough stuff  if that s your thing 
take it elsewhere 
no business talk  and no names 
  right 
how did you get into this 
  a friend of mine   
he introduced you to the list
but failed to explain the basics 
well  he had to leave town 
i m doing something
wrong here  aren t i 
it s not that  you just strike me
as something of a stowaway 
if it wasn t for the  4 000 suit 
i d say you didn t belong here at all 
this is us 
although 
someone obviously thought you did 
and i m a sucker for bashful boys 
can i ask you something 
why do you do this 
  for the same reason that men do it 
the economics of the arrangement 
intimacy without intricacy

subway station  it had been raining

wait  it just feels a little strange 
that s all 
why 
because you ve seen me before 
maybe  it s just   
  c mon  what s the problem

i guess it is a little bit
of a gear shift 
maybe some other time

not if you behave 
but if you screw with me today
what i did to her is kindness compared to
what i ll do to your little girlfriend 
why  you won t even recognize her
when i m through 
but her fate s in your hands 
if you don t go through
with it  i ll kill her 
yeah

to you later 
you ve got until 6 p m

 incomprehensible 
 music 
i just saw this in my in box 
it s for you 
i guess it came in a little
while ago by messenger 
thank you 
 wyatt  pay attention  jonathan 
this is what you re gonna do 
look for a group of sub accounts
in the liebling holloway trust 
these are masked accounts 
48 separate line items
with iban numbers ending with 6700 
you bundle these phantom accounts
and set up a standard wire transfer
to the banco nationale  madrid 
an account s already been
set up in your name 
clute nichols is
very particular about
who accesses their
private holding accounts 
but you have a
level four clearance 
and that s why you re
my friend  remember 
at exactly 5 o clock  you re gonna log in
and begin a global fund exchange 
once you re inside  you re gonna
access the liebling holloway trust
through rudolph holloway s
private account 
you ll only have 40 minutes
to locate the private trust accounts
and manually consolidate all balances
into a single fund wire 
once you re done  you ll encode
this fund wire for an end of day transfer
to the clute nichols office in hong kong 
the asian market
opens 15 hours ahead of us 
thus  this transfer will be catalogued
as friday s business
and won t flag on the clute transfer log
until end of business monday 
that s four days after
we re done  jonathan 
that s plenty of time for me
to fill out a withdrawal slip in spain
