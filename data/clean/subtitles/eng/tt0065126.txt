my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how sweet the sound   
that man up there on the porch   
that s judge parker 
he watches all the hangings 
  he says it s his sense of duty 
  who knows what s in a man s heart 
    amen 
the hangman s a yankee 
they say he won t spring the trap
on a boy that wore the blue 
no  i m here  i ll see it all 
my goodness 
that s not a faint hearted judge 
chaney ll get his due
before such a judge 
is that the man 
that is my father 
if you would like to kiss him 
it would be all right 
no   
put the lid on it 
i m mattie ross
of dardanelle in yell county 
and this is my friend  yarnell
pointdexter  who works on our place 
yes  ma am  state your business 
my father was killed in fort smith
by a coward named tom chaney 
what are you doing
about the murder 
we do know this  his name s
chambers  he s in indian territory 
we think he robbed a mail hack
tuesday down on the poteau river 
he s medium height 
with a black mark on his cheek 
that s tom chaney 
there s no chambers to it 
he got that black mark
when a man fired a pistol in his face 
  why aren t you out looking for him 
  i ve no authority in the indian nation 
he s now the business
of the us marshal 
  who s the best marshal they have 
  bill waters is the best tracker 
the meanest one is rooster cogburn 
double tough  knows no fear 
l t quinn is the straightest 
he brings them in alive 
  where would i find this rooster 
  at the federal court this afternoon 
he s bringing in prisoners
from the territory 
  is chaney one of them 
  i don t know  that s federal business 
your father s gun   
you ll want to take it home  i expect 
his saddle is
at colonel stonehill s stock barn 
and the rest of his things are
at the monarch boarding house 
i won t rest till tom chaney s
barking in hell 
yarnell   
you stay with papa 
when you get home  put him
in a better coffin with mason s apron 
your mama wants you home 
mama knows i can take care of myself 
tell her not to sign anything till i return 
people ll take it wrong
that i leave this to you 
but i got papa s business to see to 
tell mama i m staying
at the monarch boarding house 
i m going to see
if tom chaney s been brought in 
and then i ll see this rooster cogburn

thank you very much 
i appreciate your kindness

  they ll hurt your eyes 
  how s that 
they ll hurt your eyes
looking for the chicken 
you squirrel headed bastard 
howdy  what s your name 
i d like to go to bed now  but first
i d like to see my father s traps 
i ll take a guess
and say your name is mattie ross 
  mr la beef is a handsome man 
  he needs a bath and a shave 
  he hails from texas 
  judge he s proud of his cowlick 
  how did he guess my name 
  he s a good guesser  i guess 
we re short of rooms
on account of the hanging 
you ll sleep in here
with grandma turner 
don t worry about grandma turner 
she s used to doubling up 
i take it my rent will be half  then 
these are your father s traps 
the watch and the knife are inside 
chaney stole his money and his horse 
what do you think
of marshal rooster cogburn 
rooster cogburn  i ve heard
some terrible things about him 
he loves to pull a cork  i know that 
his honour  judge parker 
all rise 
i ll have a peppermint
to settle my stomach 
yes  sir 
the united states court
of the western district 
having criminal jurisdiction in the indian
territory  is now in session 
is that judge parker 
the hanging judge 
he s a tough customer  there s no
appeal except to the president himself 
call deputy marshal cogburn 
mr reuben j cogburn
will take the stand 
you were sworn this morning 
you re still sworn 
defence will cross examine 
mr cogburn  you testified
for the prosecution this morning 
allow me to summarise what you said 
according to your story   
   c c wharton grabbed a shotgun
and killed marshal potter 
then he turned the gun on you 
and you shot him 
then the father swung his axe 
and you shot him  too 
the defendant tried to run 
you say  and you also shot him 
just winged him 
or he wouldn t be here to pay up 
the old man and cc hit the ground dead 
how long have you been
a deputy marshal  mr cogburn 
four years  come march 
how many men have you shot
in that time 
  the prosecution objects 
  overruled 
how many men have you shot
since becoming a marshal 
  i never shot nobody i didn t have to 
  that s not the question  how many 
shot or killed 
let s restrict it to killed 
a more manageable figure 
well  twelve to fifteen  stopping men
in flight and defending myself 
twelve to fifteen  so many
you can t keep a specific count 
i have examined the records 
a more accurate figure is available 
come now  how many 
counting them two whartons 
twenty three 
i felt you d come to it
with a little effort 
twenty three dead men in four years 
that makes about six men a year 
  it s a dangerous business 
  how much more for those you arrest 
is it not true that
you sprang upon the whartons
with a deadly six shot revolver 
  i always try to be ready 
  was this revolver loaded and cocked 
a gun that s unloaded
ain t good for nothing 
just answer  if you please 
  the question don t make sense 
  don t bandy words with counsel 
yes  sir 
you testified you backed away
from old man wharton 
  yes  sir 
  which direction 
backward  i always go backward
when i m backing away 
i appreciate the humour of that remark 
aaron wharton was standing by a pot
when you arrived 
more like squatting 
he was stirring the fire under the pot 
  how far did you back away 
  six  eight steps 
meaning wharton advanced the same
distance  six or eight steps 
  sixteen feet 
  something like that 
then explain why the body was found
by the wash pot 
one arm in the flames 
the sleeve and hand smouldering 
them hogs 
they may have moved the body 
hogs  indeed 
mr goudy  do you have
any more questions 
none that i ll get a straight answer to 
i m finished with him 
you re dismissed  mr cogburn 
call the next witness 
cecil falling leaf  take the stand 
raise your right hand   
  mr rooster cogburn 
  what is it 
i d like to talk with you a minute 
they say you re a man with true grit 
what do you want  speak up 
you ve already wrinkled the paper   
it s pretty loose
because your makings are too dry 
i m looking for tom chaney 
well  who s he 
he shot and killed my father 
frank ross 
he s in the indian territory 
i need somebody to go after him 
  who are you 
  mattie ross 
my family has 480 acres
of good bottomland in yell county 
mother s home looking after
my baby sister and brother 
why don t you go home
and leave me alone 
they ll need help with the churning 
mr cogburn 
you can get a fugitive warrant
for chaney and  2 for bringing him in 
plus 10 cents a mile for each of you 
and i ll give you  50 reward 
you ve looked into this right smart 
yes  i mean business 
what have you got in your poke 
by god  girl  that s a colt s dragoon 
you re no bigger than a corn nubbin 
what are you doing with this pistol 
my father carried it bravely in the war 
i intend to kill tom chaney with it
if the law fails 
this ll sure get the job done 
if you can find a fence post to rest it on
while you take aim 
i m afraid nothing ll be done
about chaney unless i do it myself 
  i don t think you ve got  50 
  after my horse trading  i ll have it 
do you know the robber
lucky ned pepper 
i know him    well 
i shot him in the lip last august
over at winding stair mountains 
he was lucky that day 
my shooting was off 
well  i think chaney s
tied up with him 
  yeah 
  yeah 
  ned pepper  huh 
  yeah   
baby sister  i don t think
you can get  50 
but i ll take you home
and give you supper 
we ll talk it over  make medicine 
how does that suit you 
right down to the ground 
i d like to meet your family 
this is my father  chen lee 
and my nephew 
general sterling price 
you want more  missy 
i ve had enough 
and enough is as good as a feast 
i ve never seen chopsticks work before 
chopsticks save the fingers 
  gimme your cup 
  i don t drink coffee  thank you 
  well  what do you drink 
  i m partial to cold buttermilk 
well  we ain t got none of that 
we ain t got no lemonade either 
let s get to the game 
  my deal 
  yes  sir 
  what about my proposition 
  thinking on it 
sounds like a mighty easy way
to make  50 to me 
don t crowd me  i m figuring expenses 
how you can play cards  drink whisky
and think detective at the same time 
well  if i have to go up against
ned pepper  it ll cost  100  i figure 
and 50 in advance 
  you re trying to take advantage of me 
  they re my children s rates 
it isn t going to be easy
smoking old ned out 
he ll be holed up
down that indian nation 
well  i m not going
to keep you in whisky 
i don t buy that  i confiscate it 
a touch of it wouldn t do you
any harm against the night air 
it s the real article 
genuine double rectified bust head 
aged in the keg 
i would not put a thief in my mouth
to steal my brains 
well  sis  my price is  100 
there it is  want to make medicine 
i will think about your proposition 
you better walk me
over to the boarding house 
you are a lot of trouble 
wait till i finish this hand 
you can t tell what s in a chinaman s
mind  that s the way he bests you 
i go 
scat 
mr rat   
my writ here says you must stop
eating chen lee s cornmeal forthwith 
it s a rat writ  writ for a rat 
and this is lawful service of same 
see  he doesn t pay any attention to me 
outside is the place for shooting 
i m serving some papers 
that was your job in the first place 
you can t serve papers
on a rat  baby sister 
you ve got to kill him or let him be 
are you going to drink all of that 
judge parker    old carpetbagger 
but he knows his rats 
we had a good court   
   until those pettifogging lawyers
moved in 
the ratcatcher s too tough on the rats 
 give them rats a fair show   they say 
what fair show
did they give old man potter 
tell me that  finer man never lived 
you re useless in this condition 
i ll walk over there by myself 
  you scared of the dark 
  never 
if i had a big horse pistol like that 
i wouldn t be scared of the booger man 
i m not scared of no booger man 
  sugar 
  no thanks 
  cream 
  please 
just a dab 
miss ross 
i d like some private words with you 
and you i find a sweet distraction 
as most men do 
  will you excuse us 
  of course  mr la beef 
what do you want of me 
who are you 
i m nobody yet 
but i expect to go high 
how 
to begin with  i expect to marry well 
you have the haircomb for it 
  how did you know my name 
  i saw your mother yesterday 
what business did you have with her 
this  can you identify
the man in this picture 
that s a likeness of chaney 
with no black mark on his face 
but that s him 
i m looking for him  and you are  too 
i know all about your father 
why didn t you show me this
last night 
i only take one step at a time 
that s why i was given two feet 
his real name is theron chelmsford 
he killed a senator in waco  texas 
i ve been on his trail
almost 4 months 
  you re some kind of law 
  i m a sergeant in the texas rangers 
i m working for the family
of the late senator 
chelmsford  or chaney 
shot the senator s bird dog 
the senator threatened to whip him 
and chaney shot him 
don t worry about chaney any more 
i aim to have him hanged 
the sheriff told me you were looking
for a man to go after him 
i ve already found one for the job 
rooster cogburn 
he s the toughest deputy marshal
they have 
maybe i ll throw in with you
and the federal marshal 
  you ll have to talk to him 
  there s mutual advantage 
he knows the land  and i know chaney 
it s at least a two man job
to take him alive 
i must have him alive down to texas 
we re not taking him back to texas 
we ll take him to fort smith to hang 
  is it important where he hangs 
  it is to me 
more so to me  there s a lady in waco
who d look favourably on me 
a hanging in texas
would serve just as well 
no  i want chaney to pay for killing
my father  not for some bird dog 
it won t be for the dog 
lt ll be for the senator and your father 
he ll be just as dead 
if i couldn t find chaney in 4 months 
i would not advise others how to do it 
earlier i thought
of stealing a kiss from you 
although you are very young
and unattractive to boot 
but now i d sooner give you
some licks with my belt 
one would be as unpleasant
as the other 
you texans are ignorant of our ways 
we don t go easy on men
who abuse women and children 
texan children show more respect
for their elders 
texans gouge their horses with brutal
spurs and cultivate their hair like lettuce 
you ll push that saucy line too far 
i have no regard for you 
but i m sure you have enough
for yourself to go around 
they are all for sale 
except those four scrubby ones 
  and    who do they belong to 
  the heirs of the late frank ross 
i m mattie ross  and i d like
to sell you back those ponies 
that s out of the question 
my father bought them for breeding 
but they re all geldings 
  you cannot breed geldings 
  that hardly concerns me 
he bought four ponies for  100 
and there s an end of it 
i want  300 for papa s saddle horse 
stolen from your barn 
  take that up with the man who stole it 
  he stole it while it was in your care 
you are responsible 
i admire your sand  but    l m not liable 
  i will take it to the law 
  do as you think best 
we ll see if a widow and three children
can get fair treatment in these courts 
  you have no case 
  lawyer daggett may think otherwise 
  you are impudent 
  i do not wish to be  sir 
but i will not be pushed about 
  i ll take it up with my attorney 
  and i with mine 
he and i will make money 
and your lawyer will make money 
and you  mr auctioneer  will foot the bill 
you re a damned nuisance 
who is this famous pleader  of whom
i was ignorant 10 minutes ago 
you ve heard of the great arkansas
river vicksburg and gulf company 
i have done business
with the gav   g  yes 
my lawyer forced them
into receivership 
they tried to mess with him 
all right  come inside 
sit down 
i will pay a total of  200
to your father s estate
when i have in my hand
a letter absolving me of all liability
from the beginning
of the world to date 
i want  200 for the horse duty
plus another  100 for the ponies 
the ponies have no part in this 
i won t buy them back 
i ll keep the ponies  and the price
for judy will be  300 
i wouldn t pay that for pegasus 
listen  as i will not bargain further 
i will take the ponies back 
keep your father s saddle for  200 
my lawyer would not wish me
to consider anything under  300 
that s for everything
except the saddle 
i would like to have that in writing 
for what it s worth 
when i have it in my hand 
i ll remit the extortion money 
this is your release 
you ll find it in order 
you had that already written out 
  i ll give you a cheque 
  i prefer cash 
one hundred  two hundred   
   three hundred 
you ll find a buyer
for those ponies very soon 
i have a tentative offer of  10 a head
from the soap works at little rock 
such a shame to render
spirited horseflesh into soap 
  i m sure the deal will fall through 
  expect me back for my saddle 
i m sure i can 
do you know
a marshal rooster cogburn 
most people know rooster cogburn 
and some live to regret it 
i wouldn t be surprised to learn
he s a relative of yours 
  morning 
  good morning 
  where s mr cogburn 
  sleep late  very drunk last night 
i ve never seen anybody in bed
at 10 a m  who wasn t sick 
coffee 
you ain t such an early bird yourself 
i almost gave up on you 
figured you d gone home 
  you need more slats in that bed 
  ain t no slats in it at all 
some kind of a chinese rope bed
torture contraption  i d burn   
you got it  how much is there 
you still game 
i was born game 
and i intend to go out that way 
all right  one understanding 
we leave this afternoon to get him 
  you re not going 
  you misjudge me 
i can t go up against pepper s gang 
looking after a baby at the same time 
  i m not a baby 
  there s no hot grub or warm beds 
i ve slept out at night before
while hunting coons 
this ain t no coon hunt 
it s no place for a kid 
  they said that about coon hunting 
  you ll be calling for mama 
i ve left off crying 
make up your mind  if you re not
game  i ll find somebody who is 
i know you can drink whisky 
and i saw you kill a rat 
but all the rest has been talk 
and i m not paying for talk 
  i ought to paddle your rump 
  how do you propose to do that 
if i smelled as bad as you 
i wouldn t live near people 
i ve made up a short agreement
between us 
sign it 
here s  25 
i ll give you another  25 when we
leave and  50 when the job is done 
we can get started at first light 
we ll cross the ferry and talk
to an informer in the indian nation 
he might know something 
i ll be more than ready 
well  general   
look what we got 
there s an old saw that says 
 one white foot  buy him  
 two white feet  try him  
 three white feet  be on the sly  
 four white feet  pass him by  
but i don t hold with that 
i just heard that a young girl fell
head first into a fifty foot well 
i thought perhaps it was you 
no  it was not i 
what do you hear
from the soap man 
  nothing 
  i ll take one of the ponies 
the black one with the white
stockings  i ll call him little blackie 
  what is your offer 
  the market price 
the soap man offered you
 10 a head   
that is a lot price  i paid you
 25 a head only this morning 
  that was the price then 
  tell me this   
do you entertain plans
of ever leaving this city 
yes  i m off early tomorrow morning
for the indian nation 
marshal cogburn and i are going
after the murderer tom chaney 
cogburn   
how did you light
on that greasy vagabond 
they say he has grit 
  i wanted a man with grit 
  i suppose he has that 
he s a notorious thumper  not a man
i would care to share a bed with 
  nor would i 
  i wouldn t trust him too much 
i paid a token payment  the balance
is paid when the job s done 
it may prove to be
a long  hard journey 
a christian does not flinch
from these difficulties 
neither does he rashly court them 
he is not wilful or presumptuous 
  you think i m wrong 
  i think you are wrong headed 
i ll pay  12 for that pony   
   if you shoe him for me 
i will not ride a barefoot pony 
  good morning 
  good morning 
howdy 
  what are you doing here 
  having a chat with the marshal 
sit down  sis  have some taffy 
this jaybird says
he s on the track of the same man 
i told him we re not interested 
he s gone behind my back 
a fella that carries a big bore carbine
might come in handy 
if we get jumped
by elephants or buffalo 
we don t need him 
  everything ready 
  all but the grub 
i must have the wrong man 
  you let little girls hooraw you 
  mind repeating that  jaybird 
the marshal s working for me 
  how much is she paying you 
  enough 
is she paying you  500 
no 
that s what the governor of texas
is paying on conviction of chaney 
 500  very little for a man
who s killed a senator 
bibbs was a little senator 
i guess i ll just stick with sis 
the bibbs family s put up
another  1 500 for chaney 
  what are the terms 
  just deliver chaney  alive or dead 
that s more to my liking 
how will you split up the money 
if we take him alive  i ll split
the  1 500 and keep the state s  500 
if we kill him  i ll give you  500
of the bibbs  money 
i don t want chaney
taken back to texas 
  he wants him punished  so do you 
  i want him to hang for my father 
i don t care about senators in texas 
you can tell him to his face 
you can make him eat sand 
you can shoot him in the foot 
but first we gotta catch him 
  you can t have it all your own way 
  i ve paid for it so i ll have it my way 
i don t understand at all 
she ain t going anyhow 
go home to your mama 
  i told her she could go 
  no  she ll make trouble 
maybe i ll catch this chaney
by myself and take all the money 
you might deliver him 
but i d see you didn t collect a thing 
  how d you do that 
  i d dispute your claim 
do that  and i ll kill you 
don t count on shading someone
you don t know  fella 
i ain t seen no one from texas
i couldn t shade 
la beef  you cross me and you d think
a thousand bricks had fell on you 
you ll wish you was back
at the alamo 
knock him down  rooster 
that reward s just la beef s talk 
i ve given you good cash 
he ll cheat you 
a fella s gotta think about himself
sometimes  sister 
we ll get your man 
that s the main thing 
give me my  25 back  hand it over 
i spent it 
  you sorry piece of trash 
  i ll get it for you 
if you think you can cheat me 
you re mistaken 
you may well hear from my lawyer 
lawyer  what lawyer 
don t worry about him 
worry about our business at hand 
  red 
  morning 
  river looks kind of high 
  it s been raining up country 
  who are you looking for this time 
  if i told you  you might tell him 
well    you re well enough armed 
i d say   tom chaney  look out

your head  you re not going 
forget about the freight
and take us across

i ll be on this side 
don t shoot unless i do 
we want them in that dugout 
i ll shoot the last man in the door

  then he ll know we re serious 
i ll holler down after i shoot 
see if anyone wants to be taken alive 
but when they won t  we ll shoot them 
  i want chaney alive 
  so does the governor of texas 
all i know is there s a lot of them

  i can t see anything from over there 
  you ve seen enough killing today 
i m not staying by myself

so you can shoot your own foot off 
why do you keep
that one chamber empty

  what for 
  some have got blood on them 
we ain t lighting no matches 
i don t want any 
what did you do before this 
just about everything   
except keep school 
  how did you lose your eye 
  it was in the war 
the lone jack 
a scrap outside kansas city 
what did you do after the war 
i robbed a paymaster  went to illinois
and bought an eating place 
married a grass widow 
the place had a billiard table 
  you never told me you had a wife 
  i didn t have her long 
my friends were a pack of river rats 
and she didn t crave their society 
she upped and left me and went back
to her first husband in paducah 
 goodbye  reuben   she says 
 the love of decency ain t in you  
that s a divorced woman
talking for you about decency 
i told her   goodbye  nola  
 i hope that bastard
makes you happy this time  
did you have any children 
there was a boy 
nola took him with her 
he never liked me anyway 
a clumsier child
you ll never see than horace 
i bet he broke forty cups 
never did get you
for stealing that money 
  i didn t consider it stealing 
  it didn t belong to you 
i needed a road stake 
like that bank in new mexico 
i needed a road stake 
and there it was 
i never robbed no citizen
or took a man s watch 
it s all stealing 
that s the position
those new mexicans took 
i had to flee for my life 
bo was a young colt then  no horse
could run him into the ground 
when that posse thinned out 
i turned bo around and 
taking the reins in my teeth 
charged them boys
firing two navy sixes 
they must have been married men
who loved their families 
 cause they scattered
and ran for home 
you don t have any family  do you 
except chen lee and that lazy cat 
general price don t belong to me 
cats don t belong to nobody 
he just rooms with me 
course i depend on him   
well   
baby sister  you better try
and get some sleep 
i ll wake you up when they get here 
shh

  smelling around

that s ned pepper  all right 
quincy  moon 
that s him hollering 
that s the original
mexican bob with him 
  there s more than one 
  there s a younger one 
but he ain t a patch to this one 
moon 
quincy 
now he s done it 
over here  ned 
i m hit 
they don t call him
lucky ned pepper for nothing 
that man gave his life for him 
he didn t even look back 
looking back is a bad habit 
well

i was on the move to a better place 
and i heard the first shot 
more likely asleep 
  you know who they are 
  the one on the sand spit s haze

that s nothing but a little scratch 
that s nothing to do with you 
go make us some coffee

  let it go and go on inside 
why are you being so foolish

i heard quantrell and his men weren t
soldiers but murdering thieves 
i heard the same thing 
i heard they murdered
women and children 
i heard that  too 
and it s a damn lie 
what outfit were you with
during the war 
  shreveport  with kirby smith 
  i mean what side were you on 
i served with general kirby smith 
i don t have to hang my head
when i say it 
go ahead  make me look
foolish in her eyes 
you don t need me for that 
i don t like the way
you make conversation 
i don t like your conversation
about captain quantrell 
captain  captain of what 
a bunch of thieves 
young fella  if you re looking
for trouble  i ll accommodate you 
otherwise    leave it alone 
i ve been thinking about pepper 
maybe he d have murdered those two
so they wouldn t inform on him 
  ned wouldn t do that 
  why not 
he doesn t kill people for no reason 
had he a reason  he d kill them

that aged him 
his wife commenced running things 
i wasn t about to work for her

a man will never work for a woman
unless he s got clabber for brains 
what about the  25 i paid you

once after he was dead

am i addressing
marshal reuben j cogburn 
you re addressing him  chen lee
and general sterling price 
well    l ll not ask which is which 
but i ll identify myself 
i am lawyer  j noble daggett 
  i ll be damned 
  what 
well  you re not   
exactly what we expected 
you re a little    you re shrunk 
i ll tell you frankly 
i fully intended to have you jailed 
and i m just the man who could do it 
but when mattie told me the straight
of the matter  i had second thoughts 
i still think you showed
poor judgement in this affair 
but you re not the scoundrel
i took you for 
you have my thanks and 
with certain reservations  my respect 
how nice  how is sis 
gravely ill  i m afraid 
but still able to direct her affairs 
she commissioned me
to pay you the balance of the  75 due 
  she didn t ask for a receipt  did she 
  as a matter of fact  she did 
you will find that it also covers
an additional  200   
   for saving her life 
well  i will be damned 
she says that when she goes home 
she wants you to take her there 
poor child does not know
how ill she really is 
lawyer  j noble daggett 
are you a betting man 
on occasion 
all of this and general price 
that she makes it back to yell county 
oh  no 
no  sir  no  sir 
why didn t you look up
la beef s girl in waco 
i did the best i could 
i took the boy home
to be buried in his ranger s suit 
no girl showed up 
i don t believe there was one 
you were too busy
collecting the reward 
i was just a little busy  they forgot
how much the reward was 
  i had to help them remember 
  i can imagine how you did that 
this is what i wanted you to see 
papa s marker was
not what was ordered 
i had to make
that fool of a stoneman change it 
some day  mama will be here 
and my brother
and his family over there 
and that is for my sister
and her family 
and i will be here 
on the other side of papa 
it s comforting to know
where we ll meet eternity 
i would like you
to rest beside me  rooster 
now  sis  that place
should be for your family 
your husband  kids   
you have no kin 
i don t count chen lee and the cat 
where would you end up 
a neglected patch of weeds 
i might just take you up
on that offer  sis 
excuse me
if i don t try to move in too soon 
i think it s only right
that you have papa s gun 
  it might keep you alive 
  i m not so sure about that 
almost got you killed
when it misfired once 
because you loaded it wrong
in a state of drunkenness 
  i ought to get you to show me how 
  i will 
  trust you to buy another tall horse 
  yeah   
he s not as game as bo  but stonehill
