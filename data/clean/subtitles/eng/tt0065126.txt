what do you think
of marshal rooster cogburn
rooster cogburn ive heard
some terrible things about him
he loves to pull a cork i know that
his honour judge parker
all rise
ill have a peppermint
to settle my stomach
yes sir
the united states court
of the western district
having criminal jurisdiction in the indian
territory is now in session
is that judge parker
the hanging judge
hes a tough customer theres no
appeal except to the president himself
call deputy marshal cogburn
mr reuben j cogburn
will take the stand
you were sworn this morning
youre still sworn
defence will crossexamine
mr cogburn you testified
for the prosecution this morning
allow me to summarise what you said
according to your story
c c wharton grabbed a shotgun
and killed marshal potter
then he turned the gun on you
and you shot him
then the father swung his axe
and you shot him too
the defendant tried to run
you say and you also shot him
just winged him
or he wouldnt be here to pay up
the old man and cc hit the ground dead
how long have you been
a deputy marshal mr cogburn
four years come march
how many men have you shot
in that time
the prosecution objects
overruled
how many men have you shot
since becoming a marshal
i never shot nobody i didnt have to
thats not the question how many
shot or killed
lets restrict it to killed
a more manageable figure
well twelve to fifteen stopping men
in flight and defending myself
twelve to fifteen so many
you cant keep a specific count
i have examined the records
a more accurate figure is available
come now how many
counting them two whartons
twentythree
i felt youd come to it
with a little effort
twentythree dead men in four years
that makes about six men a year
its a dangerous business
how much more for those you arrest
is it not true that
you sprang upon the whartons
with a deadly sixshot revolver
i always try to be ready
was this revolver loaded and cocked
a gun thats unloaded
aint good for nothing
just answer if you please
the question dont make sense
dont bandy words with counsel
yes sir
you testified you backed away
from old man wharton
yes sir
which direction
backward i always go backward
when im backing away
i appreciate the humour of that remark
aaron wharton was standing by a pot
when you arrived
more like squatting
he was stirring the fire under the pot
how far did you back away
six eight steps
meaning wharton advanced the same
distance six or eight steps
sixteen feet
something like that
then explain why the body was found
by the wash pot
one arm in the flames
the sleeve and hand smouldering
them hogs
they may have moved the body
hogs indeed
mr goudy do you have
any more questions
none that ill get a straight answer to
im finished with him
youre dismissed mr cogburn
call the next witness
cecil falling leaf take the stand
raise your right hand
mr rooster cogburn
what is it
id like to talk with you a minute
they say youre a man with true grit
what do you want speak up
youve already wrinkled the paper
its pretty loose
because your makings are too dry
im looking for tom chaney
well whos he
he shot and killed my father
frank ross
hes in the indian territory
i need somebody to go after him
who are you
mattie ross
my family has 480 acres

theyll need help with the churning
mr cogburn
you can get a fugitive warrant
for chaney and 2 for bringing him in
plus 10 cents a mile for each of you
and ill give you 50 reward
youve looked into this right smart
yes i mean business
what have you got in your poke
by god girl thats a colts dragoon
youre no bigger than a corn nubbin
what are you doing with this pistol
my father carried it bravely in the war
i intend to kill tom chaney with it
if the law fails
thisll sure get the job done
if you can find a fence post to rest it on
while you take aim
im afraid nothingll be done
about chaney unless i do it myself
i dont think youve got 50
after my horsetrading ill have it
do you know the robber
lucky ned pepper
i know him well
i shot him in the lip last august
over at winding stair mountains
he was lucky that day
my shooting was off

sounds like a mighty easy way
to make 50 to me
dont crowd me im figuring expenses
how you can play cards drink whisky
and think detective at the same time
well if i have to go up against
ned pepper itll cost 100 i figure
and 50 in advance
youre trying to take advantage of me
theyre my childrens rates
it isnt going to be easy
smoking old ned out
hell be holed up
down that indian nation
well im not going
to keep you in whisky
i dont buy that i confiscate it
a touch of it wouldnt do you
any harm against the night air

to steal my brains

there it is want to make medicine
i will think about your proposition

you cant serve papers
on a rat baby sister
youve got to kill him or let him be

judge parker old carpetbagger
but he knows his rats
we had a good court
until those pettifogging lawyers
moved in
the ratcatchers too tough on the rats
give them rats a fair show they say
what fair show
did they give old man potter
tell me that finer man never lived
youre useless in this condition
ill walk over there by myself
you scared of the dark
never
if i had a big horsepistol like that
i wouldnt be scared of the booger man
im not scared of no booger man
sugar
no thanks
cream
please
just a dab
miss ross
id like some private words with you
and you i find a sweet distraction
as most men do
will you excuse us
of course mr la beef
what do you want of me
who are you
im nobody yet
but i expect to go high
how
to begin with i expect to marry well
you have the haircomb for it
how did you know my name
i saw your mother yesterday
what business did you have with her
this can you identify
the man in this picture
thats a likeness of chaney
with no black mark on his face
but thats him
im looking for him and you are too
i know all about your father
why didnt you show me this
last night
i only take one step at a time
thats why i was given two feet
his real name is theron chelmsford
he killed a senator in waco texas
ive been on his trail
almost 4 months
youre some kind of law
im a sergeant in the texas rangers
im working for the family
of the late senator
chelmsford or chaney
shot the senators bird dog
the senator threatened to whip him
and chaney shot him
dont worry about chaney any more
i aim to have him hanged
the sheriff told me you were looking
for a man to go after him
ive already found one for the job
rooster cogburn
hes the toughest deputy marshal
they have
maybe ill throw in with you
and the federal marshal
youll have to talk to him
theres mutual advantage
he knows the land and i know chaney
its at least a twoman job
to take him alive
i must have him alive down to texas
were not taking him back to texas
well take him to fort smith to hang
is it important where he hangs
it is to me
more so to me theres a lady in waco
whod look favourably on me
a hanging in texas
would serve just as well
no i want chaney to pay for killing
my father not for some bird dog
it wont be for the dog
ltll be for the senator and your father
hell be just as dead
if i couldnt find chaney in 4 months
i would not advise others how to do it
earlier i thought
of stealing a kiss from you
although you are very young
and unattractive to boot
but now id sooner give you
some licks with my belt
one would be as unpleasant
as the other
you texans are ignorant of our ways
we dont go easy on men
who abuse women and children
texan children show more respect
for their elders
texans gouge their horses with brutal
spurs and cultivate their hair like lettuce
youll push that saucy line too far
i have no regard for you
but im sure you have enough
for yourself to go around
they are all for sale
except those four scrubby ones
and who do they belong to
the heirs of the late frank ross
im mattie ross and id like
to sell you back those ponies
thats out of the question
my father bought them for breeding
but theyre all geldings
you cannot breed geldings
that hardly concerns me
he bought four ponies for 100
and theres an end of it
i want 300 for papas saddle horse
stolen from your barn
take that up with the man who stole it
he stole it while it was in your care
you are responsible
i admire your sand but lm not liable
i will take it to the law
do as you think best
well see if a widow and three children
can get fair treatment in these courts
you have no case
lawyer daggett may think otherwise
you are impudent
i do not wish to be sir
but i will not be pushed about
ill take it up with my attorney
and i with mine
he and i will make money
and your lawyer will make money
and you mr auctioneer will foot the bill
youre a damned nuisance
who is this famous pleader of whom
i was ignorant 10 minutes ago
youve heard of the great arkansas
river vicksburg and gulf company
i have done business
with the gav  g yes
my lawyer forced them
into receivership
they tried to mess with him
all right come inside
sit down
i will pay a total of 200
to your fathers estate
when i have in my hand
a letter absolving me of all liability
from the beginning
of the world to date
i want 200 for the horse duty
plus another 100 for the ponies
the ponies have no part in this
i wont buy them back
ill keep the ponies and the price
for judy will be 300
i wouldnt pay that for pegasus
listen as i will not bargain further
i will take the ponies back
keep your fathers saddle for 200
my lawyer would not wish me
to consider anything under 300
thats for everything
except the saddle
i would like to have that in writing
for what its worth
when i have it in my hand
ill remit the extortion money
this is your release
youll find it in order
you had that already written out
ill give you a cheque
i prefer cash
one hundred two hundred
three hundred
youll find a buyer
for those ponies very soon
i have a tentative offer of 10 a head
from the soap works at little rock
such a shame to render
spirited horseflesh into soap
im sure the deal will fall through
expect me back for my saddle
im sure i can
do you know
a marshal rooster cogburn
most people know rooster cogburn
and some live to regret it
i wouldnt be surprised to learn
hes a relative of yours
morning
good morning
wheres mr cogburn
sleep late very drunk last night
ive never seen anybody in bed
at 10 am who wasnt sick
coffee
you aint such an early bird yourself
i almost gave up on you
figured youd gone home
you need more slats in that bed
aint no slats in it at all
some kind of a chinese rope bed
torture contraption id burn
you got it how much is there
you still game
i was born game
and i intend to go out that way
all right one understanding
we leave this afternoon to get him
youre not going
you misjudge me
i cant go up against peppers gang
looking after a baby at the same time
im not a baby
theres no hot grub or warm beds
ive slept out at night before
while hunting coons
this aint no coonhunt
its no place for a kid
they said that about coonhunting
youll be calling for mama
ive left off crying
make up your mind if youre not
game ill find somebody who is
i know you can drink whisky
and i saw you kill a rat
but all the rest has been talk
and im not paying for talk
i ought to paddle your rump
how do you propose to do that
if i smelled as bad as you
i wouldnt live near people
ive made up a short agreement
between us
sign it
heres 25
ill give you another 25 when we
leave and 50 when the job is done
we can get started at first light
well cross the ferry and talk
to an informer in the indian nation
he might know something
ill be more than ready
well general
look what we got
theres an old saw that says
one white foot buy him
two white feet try him
three white feet be on the sly
four white feet pass him by
but i dont hold with that
i just heard that a young girl fell
head first into a fiftyfoot well
i thought perhaps it was you
no it was not i
what do you hear
from the soap man
nothing
ill take one of the ponies
the black one with the white
stockings ill call him little blackie
what is your offer
the market price
the soap man offered you
10 a head
that is a lot price i paid you
25 a head only this morning
that was the price then
tell me this
do you entertain plans
of ever leaving this city
yes im off early tomorrow morning
for the indian nation
marshal cogburn and i are going
after the murderer tom chaney
cogburn
how did you light
on that greasy vagabond
they say he has grit
i wanted a man with grit
i suppose he has that
hes a notorious thumper not a man
i would care to share a bed with
nor would i
i wouldnt trust him too much
i paid a token payment the balance
is paid when the jobs done
it may prove to be
a long hard journey
a christian does not flinch
from these difficulties
neither does he rashly court them
he is not wilful or presumptuous
you think im wrong
i think you are wrongheaded
ill pay 12 for that pony
if you shoe him for me
i will not ride a barefoot pony
good morning
good morning
howdy
what are you doing here
having a chat with the marshal
sit down sis have some taffy
this jaybird says
hes on the track of the same man
i told him were not interested
hes gone behind my back
a fella that carries a bigbore carbine
might come in handy
if we get jumped
by elephants or buffalo
we dont need him
everything ready
all but the grub
i must have the wrong man
you let little girls hooraw you
mind repeating that jaybird
the marshals working for me
how much is she paying you
enough
is she paying you 500
no
thats what the governor of texas
is paying on conviction of chaney
500 very little for a man
whos killed a senator
bibbs was a little senator
i guess ill just stick with sis
the bibbs familys put up
another 1500 for chaney
what are the terms
just deliver chaney alive or dead
thats more to my liking
how will you split up the money
if we take him alive ill split
the 1500 and keep the states 500
if we kill him ill give you 500
of the bibbs money
i dont want chaney
taken back to texas
he wants him punished so do you
i want him to hang for my father
i dont care about senators in texas
you can tell him to his face
you can make him eat sand
you can shoot him in the foot
but first we gotta catch him
you cant have it all your own way
ive paid for it so ill have it my way
i dont understand at all
she aint going anyhow
go home to your mama
i told her she could go
no shell make trouble
maybe ill catch this chaney
by myself and take all the money
you might deliver him
but id see you didnt collect a thing
howd you do that
id dispute your claim
do that and ill kill you
dont count on shading someone
you dont know fella
i aint seen no one from texas
i couldnt shade
la beef you cross me and youd think
a thousand bricks had fell on you
youll wish you was back
at the alamo
knock him down rooster
that rewards just la beefs talk
ive given you good cash
hell cheat you
a fellas gotta think about himself
sometimes sister
well get your man
thats the main thing
give me my 25 back hand it over
i spent it
you sorry piece of trash
ill get it for you
if you think you can cheat me
youre mistaken
you may well hear from my lawyer
lawyer what lawyer
dont worry about him

red

river looks kind of high
its been raining upcountry
who are you looking for this time
if i told you you might tell him

ive got a good lawyer
that lawyer again
she draws him like a gun
i will not walk up that hill
im not going to let 50 slide
get on that horse
wait a minute
i ought to fix my hat
by god
she reminds me of me
then we might just not get along
well you were a little slow
getting across
i said you werent going go back
ill do no such thing
la beef
those horses cant get away
from little blackie
theyre loaded down
with fat men and iron
now well see what tune you sing
ill raise welts on you like worms

youre not hurting me im just mad
are you gonna let him do this
i dont believe i will drop the switch
put it down
youre enjoying it too much
i go ahead with what i start
you do and itll be the biggest
mistake you ever made
youve taken her part all along
but you aint doing her no kindness
just leave her alone
this has given me a plan
when we locate chaney we can
jump him this way and knock him out
then we can tie him up
and take him back alive

some have got blood on them
we aint lighting no matches
i dont want any
what did you do before this
just about everything
except keep school
how did you lose your eye
it was in the war
the lone jack
a scrap outside kansas city
what did you do after the war
i robbed a paymaster went to illinois
and bought an eating place
married a grass widow
the place had a billiard table
you never told me you had a wife
i didnt have her long
my friends were a pack of river rats
and she didnt crave their society
she upped and left me and went back
to her first husband in paducah
goodbye reuben she says
the love of decency aint in you
thats a divorced woman
talking for you about decency
i told her goodbye nola
i hope that bastard
makes you happy this time
did you have any children
there was a boy
nola took him with her
he never liked me anyway
a clumsier child
youll never see than horace
i bet he broke forty cups
never did get you
for stealing that money
i didnt consider it stealing
it didnt belong to you
i needed a road stake
like that bank in new mexico
i needed a road stake
and there it was
i never robbed no citizen
or took a mans watch
its all stealing
thats the position
those new mexicans took
i had to flee for my life
bo was a young colt then no horse
could run him into the ground
when that posse thinned out
i turned bo around and
taking the reins in my teeth
charged them boys
firing two navy sixes
they must have been married men
who loved their families
cause they scattered
and ran for home
you dont have any family do you
except chen lee and that lazy cat
general price dont belong to me
cats dont belong to nobody
he just rooms with me
course i depend on him
well
baby sister you better try
and get some sleep
ill wake you up when they get here

ive freighted iron stoves up
harder grades than this
well camp here
here
i was a pretty fair hand with a jerkline
when i was freighting in colorado
i worked for a fella that was
always down with something
he was carrying a 21foot tapeworm
with his business responsibilities
that aged him
his wife commenced running things
i wasnt about to work for her
so i told her so
women have no generosity
lord god how they hate to pay up
a man will never work for a woman
unless hes got clabber for brains
what about the 25 i paid you
what 25
i will not bandy words with a drunkard
thats real smart youve done
nothing when youve bested a fool
we have come nearly 50 miles
from mcalesters

if were as close as you say
i dont think you should make a fire
nobody asked you
where are you going
with that canteen

we got no water to spare for that
just take a drink
id say theres a stream down below
you wash and youll get no breakfast
well waste no more time
shouldnt one of us go down with her
it might not be safe
its safer for her
than whatever she meets
man or beast
i know you little mattie

what are you doing theres
no money for you to squeeze here
i came to fetch water
that was not my meaning
im here to take you back

theres a posse of officers
up the hill thatll force you to go
how many officers
id say 50 and they mean business
so you just walk
right in front of me up that hill
i think ill oblige
those officers to come after me
if you refuse ill have to shoot you
is that so
youd better cock your piece
all the way back until it locks

youre saying you wont go
with me of your own free will

am i addressing
marshal reuben j cogburn
youre addressing him chen lee
and general sterling price
well lll not ask which is which
but ill identify myself
i am lawyer j noble daggett
ill be damned
what
well youre not
exactly what we expected
youre a little youre shrunk
ill tell you frankly
i fully intended to have you jailed
and im just the man who could do it
but when mattie told me the straight
of the matter i had second thoughts
i still think you showed
poor judgement in this affair
but youre not the scoundrel
i took you for
you have my thanks and
with certain reservations my respect
how nice how is sis
gravely ill im afraid
but still able to direct her affairs
she commissioned me
to pay you the balance of the 75 due
she didnt ask for a receipt did she
as a matter of fact she did
you will find that it also covers
an additional 200
for saving her life
well i will be damned
she says that when she goes home
she wants you to take her there
poor child does not know
how ill she really is
lawyer j noble daggett
are you a betting man
on occasion
all of this and general price
that she makes it back to yell county
oh no
no sir no sir
why didnt you look up
la beefs girl in waco
i did the best i could
i took the boy home
to be buried in his rangers suit
no girl showed up
i dont believe there was one
you were too busy
collecting the reward
i was just a little busy they forgot
how much the reward was
i had to help them remember
i can imagine how you did that
this is what i wanted you to see
papas marker was
not what was ordered
i had to make
that fool of a stoneman change it
some day mama will be here
and my brother
and his family over there
and that is for my sister
and her family
and i will be here
on the other side of papa
its comforting to know
where well meet eternity
i would like you
to rest beside me rooster
now sis that place
should be for your family
your husband kids
you have no kin
i dont count chen lee and the cat
where would you end up
a neglected patch of weeds
i might just take you up
on that offer sis
excuse me
if i dont try to move in too soon
i think its only right
that you have papas gun
it might keep you alive
im not so sure about that
almost got you killed
when it misfired once
because you loaded it wrong
in a state of drunkenness
i ought to get you to show me how
i will
trust you to buy another tall horse
yeah
hes not as game as bo but stonehill
