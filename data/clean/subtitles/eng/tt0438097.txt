this i like 
oh  no  you won t catch me

water ball 
sammy  you just ate  wait an hour 
hector  no  no  no

ok  there is fine 
ashley  stop picking your   
pinata

ok 
  hey  it s my turn to hit the sloth 
  mine 
  mine 
  mine 
hey  you didn t have any candy in you 
  let s bury him 
  yeah 
hey  whoa  who said you kids
could torture the sloth 
manny  don t squash their creativity 
hey  manny  diego 
my bad mammals jammals 
wanna give a sloth a hand 
look  i opened my camp 
 campo del sid   it means camp of sid 
congratulations 
you re now an idiot in two languages 
not in front of the k i d z 
these little guys love me  right  billy 
don t make me eat you 
they kid  that s why they re called kids 
i told you  sid 
you re not qualified to run a camp 
what do qualifications
have to do with childcare 
besides  these kids look up to me 
i m a role model to them 
i can see that 
you guys never think i can do anything 
but i m an equal member of this herd 
i made this herd  so you need
to start treating me with some respect 
  come on  sid 
  sid  we were just kidding 
hey  let s play
pin the tail on the mammoth 
yeah 
sid 
i can do stuff 
won t give me their stupid respect 
i ll show  em 
and so  in the end 
the little burro reached his mommy 
and they lived happily ever after 
  good job 
  question 
why does the burro go home 
why doesn t he stay with the rabbits 
because    because he wanted
to be with his family 
he should go with the girl burro 
that s a better love story 
ok  well  when you tell your burro story 
that s what he ll do 
burro is a demeaning name 
technically  it s called a wild ass 
fine  the wild ass boy
came home to his wild ass mother 
see  that s why i called it a burro 
could the burro have a grazing problem 
then he d be more relatable 
  boring 
  it s not believable 
  do burros eat their young 
  it s not a good ending 
sometimes i throw up 
they lived happily ever after 
you can t get more satisfying than that 
one big  happy family 
that s the way it s supposed to be 
where s your big  happy family 
then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky little kids 
  you ok  buddy 
  sure  why not 
  i thought   
  story time s over  the end 
  run for your lives 
  where s everybody going 
  the world s coming to an end 
  what are you talking about 
fast tony   he says
the world s gonna flood 
folks  i hold in my hand
a device so powerful 
it can actually pull air
right out of the sky 
yeah  right 
gather round  gather round 
pardon me  do you have gills  ma am 
so you can t breathe underwater 
my assistant here will demonstrate 
hey  i can smell the ocean 
what are you doing 
i can t sell that now 
you suck air through your mouth 
you moron 
through its design
and sturdy construction 
you ll have plenty of air
for eons to come 
of course  results may vary 
why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff 
i m trying to make a living here  pal 
it s my weather forecast  the five day
outlook calls for intense flooding
followed by the end of the world 
and a slight chance of patchy sunshine
later in the week 
come on  don t listen to him  fast tony
would sell his own mother for a grape 
are you making an offer 
i mean  no  i would not 
haven t you heard  the ice is melting 
you see this ground 
it s covered in ice 
a thousand years ago 
it was covered in ice 
a thousand years from now 
it will still be ice 
say  buddy  not to cast aspersions
on your survival instincts or nothing 
but haven t mammoths
pretty much gone extinct 
  what are you talking about 
  about you being the last of your kind 
your breath smells like ants 
be that as it may  when s the last time
you saw another mammoth 
don t pay any attention to him 
mammoths can t go extinct 
they re the biggest things on earth 
what about the dinosaurs 
the dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies 
look  some idiot s
going down the eviscerator 
please tell me that s not our idiot 
ok  i m gonna jump
on the count of three

two and four one thousandths   
sid  what are you doing 
get down from there 
no  i m gonna be the first
to jump off the eviscerator
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect 
the only respect you ll get
is respect for the dead 
come on  manny  he s not that stupid 
  but i ve been wrong before 
  geronimo 
hey  watch it 
i can t breathe 
i think i just coughed up my spleen 
  diego  retract the claws  please

it s all gonna flood 
come on  we gotta warn them 
maybe we can rapidly evolve
into water creatures 
  that s genius  sid 
  call me squid 
this whole thing s a piece of junk 
i can t believe i live here

revolutionary gizmo we call bark

mammoths raining from the sky 
go suck air through a reed 
listen to him 
he s right about the flood 
i am  i mean  yes  i am 
wait  you said there wasn t going to be
a flood  why should we listen to you 
because we saw what s up there

flood s real  all right 
and it s coming fast 
look around  you re in a bowl 
bowl s gonna fill up  ain t no way out 
what are we gonna do 
unless you make it
to the end of the valley 
there s a boat  it can save you 
  i don t see anything 
  but
y all better hurry 
ground s melting 
walls tumbling  rocks crumbling 
survive that
and you ll be racing the water 
cos in three days  time 
it s gonna hit the geyser fields 
boom 
there is some good news  though 
the more of you die 
the better i eat 
i didn t say it was good news for you 
he must have been
a real pleasure to have in class 
dam 
all right  you heard the scary vulture 
let s move out 
manny  you really think there s a boat 
i don t know  but in a few days 
this place is gonna be underwater 
if there s any hope  it s that way 
manny  let s go 
overturned glyptodont
in the far right lane 
traffic backed up
as far as the eye can see 
and it looks like
there might be a fatality 
i call the dark meat 
come on  everybody  let s go 
come on  come  come  come  get in 
  come on  grandpa  come on

and then  they just don t admit it 
wait  what 
some of us have a tough time
holding on to branches

funny  let me have a little word
with my brothers 
ellie  are you crazy 
we re not going with them 
look  we ll never make it in time
if we only travel at night 
these guys can protect us out in the open

cos you might be
the only two mammoths left on earth 
he has a point 
sorry  when did i join
this dating service 
my brothers and i
would be delighted to come with you 
if you treat us nicely

you know the best part 
we re carrying diseases

ellie will be the mommy 
and diego will be the uncle
who eats the kids who get on my nerves 
now  let s move it before the ground
falls out from under our feet 
i thought fat guys
were supposed to be jolly 
i m not fat  it s this fur 
it makes me look big 
  it s poofy

escaping the flood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightly pounds

how would you like
to lose a ton or two 
would i ever 
don t listen to him  vera

swooped down and snatched me for dinner 
that s how cousin wilton went

to be the last one of your species 
  i m not the last one

we gotta catch up with the others 
hey  knock it off 
cry me a river  blubber tooth tiger 
have some fun 
the ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down

mammal overboard 
ellie  get up 
if you play dead  you ll be dead 
look at me 
diego 
diego 
come on  diego  come on

  what in the animal kingdom was that 
  i don t know 
from now on 
land   safe  water   not safe 
that was the bravest thing
i ve ever seen 
  it was nothing  i   
  it s not a compliment 
to a possum  bravery is just dumb 
  yeah  we re spineless 
  lily livered 
maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger 
maybe you should run away more 
good point  thanks for the advice 
happy to help 
do you believe her   bravery is dumb 
maybe you should run away more  
she s infuriating
and stubborn and narrow minded 
you like her 
  i do not 
  don t worry  your secret s safe with me 
  and so is yours 
  what secret 
you know  the one where you can t swim 
that s ridiculous 
fine  but we re living
in a melting world 
you re going to have to
face your fear sooner or later 
almost there 
  ok  ready  eddie 
  set 
let s roll 
wait for me 
no brakes  gotta roll 
meet you at the other end 
so you think she s the girl for me

and you re no fun at all 
she completes you 
yeah 
hey  manny  can you pull back the tree
and shoot me into the pond 
  no 
  come on 
you expect to impress
with that attitude 
i don t want to impress 
why are you trying
to convince her she s a mammoth 
because that s what she is 
i don t care if she thinks she s a possum 
  you can t be two things 
  au contraire  man fered 
tell that to the bullfrog 
chicken hawk or turtledove 
he s never gonna let up on you 
it ll be easier on all of us
if you just go with it 
so what do you want me to do 
pull the tree
and shoot me into the pond 
i don t know 
if you re too lame to do it 
we can get ellie 
no  no  no  no  i can do it 
i can do it 
yeah  yeah  yeah  come on  come on 
  have you done this before 
  only a million times 
farther  farther  farther 
perfect  fire 
yeah  i can fly 
crash 
crash  crash 
  crash  are you ok 
  what happened 
  manny shot him out of a tree 
  what s wrong with you 
  he said he could do it 
  and you listened to him 
crash  whatever you do 
don t go into the light 
can i help in any way here 
you ve done enough 
  are you happy now 
  crash  crash  don t leave me 
who s gonna watch my back 
who s gonna be my wingman of mayhem 
who s gonna roll
in that dung patch with me 
dung patch 
  wait  my legs  i can stand 
  he can stand 
  i can run 
  he can run  it s a miracle 
hallelujah 
what can i say  they re boys 
they make my life a little adventure 
you guys are so dead 
thanks for embarrassing me 
not the face 
ellie  ellie  me too 
she s not half bad 
crazy and confused  but sweet 
so 
so what s holding you back 
my family 
you can have that again  you know 
no  sid  i can t 
ok  ok  but think about it 
i mean  if you let this chance go 
you re letting your whole species go
and that s just    that s just selfish 
i think i m starting
to get through to him 
  wait  wait  i got you 
  slowpoke 
  need help 
  no  no  just catching my breath 
  you re stuck 
  i am not 
all right  then  let s go 
i can t 
i m stuck 
don t you think that picking them up
like this would be easier 
ellie 
i know this place 
you know  deep down 
i knew i was different 
i was a little bigger
than the other possum kids 
ok  a lot bigger 
now i understand why the possum boys
didn t find me appealing 
that s too bad 
because as far as mammoths go  you re 
  you know 
  what 
attractive 
  really 
  sure 
what about me is attractive 
i don t know 
well  there s your
butt 
what about it 
it s
big 
you re just saying that 
no  no  no  i mean it 
it s huge 
biggest darn butt i ve ever seen 
that is really sweet 
what a crazy day 
this morning i woke up a possum
and now i m a mammoth 
boy  manny sure took a big leap
with ellie today 
sure did 
he stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in  splash 
kind of brave  huh 
the way he faced his fear 
i wouldn t know 
sabres don t feel fear 
come on  all animals feel fear 
it s what separates us from  say  rocks 
rocks have no fear 
  and they sink 
  what are you getting at  sid 
it may surprise you to know
that i  too  have experienced fear 
no  you 
yeah  yes  as impossible as it seems 
the sloth has natural enemies that would
like to harm or otherwise  kill  us 
  i wonder why 
  jealousy  mostly 
but the point is that fear is natural 
fear is for prey 
well  then  you re letting
the water make you its prey 
just jump in and trust your instincts 
you know  most animals
can swim as babies 
and for a tiger  it s like crawling
on your belly to stalk helpless prey 
but faster  ok 
now  claw  kick  claw  kick 
i m stalking the prey  claw  kick 
i look back over my shoulder
to see if i m being followed 
and i m breathing 
and i m stalking
and i m stalking and i m   
  i m falling 
  correction  you re sinking 
kind of like a rock 
hey  do we do any special tricks
like roll over 
or do we just throw our weight around 
whoops  sorry 
i don t know my own strength yet 
ellie  do you realize that now
we have a chance to save our species 
  really  how are we gonna do that 
  well  you know   
did you just    
i m not a mammoth for five minutes
and you re hitting on me 
i wasn t saying   
not right now  in time 
i was just saying that
it s our responsibility 
what 
all right  that came out wrong  i   
you re very pretty  but we just met   
responsibility 
just doing your duty  is that it 
ready to make the ultimate sacrifice
to save your species 
i got some news for you  you re not saving
the species tonight or any other night 
  so  how did it go 
  not bad 
ok  let s go 
we travelled with you all day 
now you re coming with us at night 
but we can t see at night 
then enjoy the flood 
i can t even look at him 
pervert 
making friends everywhere you go 
just making friends 
  watch out  there s a stump 
  not anymore 
i thought we could walk together 
crash 
ask the mammoth why he thinks that 
she said she thinks you re a jerk
and to go away 
she didn t say   
look  maybe if we spend more time   
tell him that i need
a little personal space right now 
  she said go jump in a lake 
  and possums rule 
  i can hear her  you know 
  what do you want  a medal 
stop moving 
thank you 
manny  ellie  lock trunks 
now 
crash  eddie  grab on to that ledge 
  funny  now what s your real plan 
  just do it 
  bye  eddie 
  bye  crash 
  bye  ellie 
  go now 
i m sorry if what i said before
offended you 
what do you mean  if  it offended me 
that it offended her 
i mean that  that it offended you 
  you just overreacted  that s all 
  what 
  take it back 
  there are other lives at stake here 
  he s got a point 
  he s got nothing 
  it was a misunderstanding 
  it was insensitive 
  apologize 
  why me  she overreacted 
  just apologies 
  no 
  do it 
  ok  i m sorry 
what 
  he s right  i overreacted 
  you mean   
not another word or i ll come down there
and push you over myself 
i got it  i got it 
i got it 
manny  ellie  run  run 
i guess we finally
did something right together 
hey  don t mind me 
just hanging off the edge of a cliff here 
  remember the good old days 
  which good old days 
you know  yesterday  last week 
back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet 
yep  those were the good days 
possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths 
  we should get some sleep 
  yeah 
tomorrow s the day
the vulture said we re all going to die 
wait a minute 
can i help you

somebody here likes sid

someone recognized my true potential 
let there be fire 
if only the guys could see me now 
this is either really good
or really bad 
no  no  no 
me fire king  why kill fire king 
a thousand years  bad juju
for killing fire king 
super heated rock from earth s core
is surging to the crust 
melting ice built up
over thousands of years 
you re a very advanced race 
together  we can look for a solution 
we have one   sacrifice the fire king 
  well  that s not very advanced 
  worth a shot 
no  no 
bad juju 
water  water 
crash  i told you not to drink
before bed 
i didn t do this 
at least  not all of it 
  what s happening 
  we overslept  we need to move 
what if we re the last creatures
left alive 
we ll have to repopulate the earth 
how  everyone s either
a dude or our sister 
hi  hey  manny 
wow  what a night 
you ll never guess what happened 
you were sleepwalking 
no  no  no  i was kidnapped
by a tribe of mini sloths 
  that was gonna be my second guess 
  and they worshiped me 
i mean  sure  they tossed me into a
flaming tar pit  but they worshiped me 
you were dreaming  come on  the water s
rising faster than we re moving 
i m telling you  i was kidnapped 
i was worshiped  guys 
fine 
can we slow down a little 
i m dying here 
it was just a figure of speech 
they just sit there  watching us 
i wish i knew what they were thinking 
there  now you know
what they were thinking 
  sid 
  what  it s catchy 
  we made it 
  yeah  we showed those scary vultures 
it s just a little hot water and steam

  you are so stubborn and hard headed 
  well  i guess that proves it
