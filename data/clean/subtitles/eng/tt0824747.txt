hello my name is
christine collins
i live at 210
north avenue 23
and im calling
to report a missing child
missing child
whats your relation
to the child maam
its my son
how long has he been gone
im not sure
i just got home from work
it could be
since this morning
or it could be
just the last hour
have you checked
around the neighborhood
yes of course i did
well maybe
hes lost track of time
no no no
he always stays around the
house when it gets dark
would you please send
someone down here
im sorry
but our policy is that
we dont dispatch units
on missing child cases for 24 hours
what
look 99 times out of 100
the kid shows up by morning
we dont have the resources to go chasing
every kid who runs off with his pals
no no no
no thats not walter
he doesnt do that
with all due respect maam
every parent who calls says the same thing
please please
look theres
nothing i can do
ill take your name
and your information
but thats all until the morning
at the earliest
im sure hell show up by then
they always do
are you mrs collins
our thoughts go out
again today to mrs christine collins
of lincoln heights
whose young son
walter collins
disappeared
nearly two weeks ago
though she is not
a member of our congregation
we pray for her today
as we have every day
since we learned
of her plight
on the radio and
in the newspapers
we are told that
the los angeles police department
is doing its very best to
reunite mother and child
and im sure
that that is true
but given its status
as the most violent corrupt
and incompetent
police department
this side
of the rocky mountains
i am not sure
its saying a great deal
every day new bodies
appear along mulholland
and in the ditches
of our cities
the work of police chief james davis
and his aptly named gun squad
every day the needs
of honest citizens
are put second to greed
and personal gain
every day
this city sinks deeper into a cesspool
of fear intimidation
and corruption
once the city of angels
los angeles has become
a place where our protectors
have become
our brutalizers
where to be the law is
to be above the law
i understand
thank you
i will call back
in a few weeks
thank you very much

come on dont rush
easy easy
mrs collins id like to
introduce you to james e davis
chief of police
very nice to meet you
we dont get a lot
of positive attention
from the boys in the
press these days
so its good to be here with a
positive story dont you think
yes sir
i take it youve been treated
well by my boys in the department
i couldnt file a
report for 24 hours
and i thought that
maybe that was a
technicalities aside
it was wonderful
well good
then you wont have any trouble
telling that to the press
and the fact that the lapd
women
hold on a second
back boys back
keep them back
well arent you
arent you gonna
thats not my son
what
what are you saying
its not my son
well im sure
youre mistaken
im not mistaken
well hes been through
five terrible long months
hes lost weight
hes changed
i would know my own son
all im saying is youre
in shock and hes changed
whats your name
can you tell me your name
walter collins
its a common name
where do you live walter
you know your home address
i live at 210 avenue 23
los angeles california
and thats my mommy
mrs collins listen
to me i understand
youre feeling a little uncertain
right now and thats to be expected
a boy this age
he changes so fast
weve compensated for that
in our investigation
and theres no question
that this is your son
that is not walter
its not walter
as you remember him
and thats why its important for
you to take him home on a trial basis
a trial basis
yes yes
once hes around his
familiar surroundings
and youve given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition
you will see that
this is your walter
now i promise you i swear
to you i give you my word
this is your son
now if you have any problems any problems
at all you come and you talk to me
ill take care of it
i give you my word
trust me
mrs collins he has
nowhere else to go
please
maybe im not
thinking clearly
and
all right
all right youre not
thinking clearly thats right
here we go
thank you
thank you
here just turn
around here
how does it feel to have
your son home mrs collins
whatd you think when you
saw him for the first time
its hard to explain
she was
shocked at first
she didnt recognize the boy
which is perfectly natural
hes been through
quite an ordeal
howre you feeling son
bet it feels great
to be home
yeah its great
the los angeles
police department is thankful
for all the hard work done by the
dekalb county sheriffs department
in making this joyful
reunion possible
the lapd is dedicated to
serving the public at all times
can we get a photo with
mother and son captain
absolutely here we are
like that
like that
squeeze together
there you go boys
this way walter
big smile
one more please
thats a good one
one more
the sandwich all right
would you like
some more milk
no
no thank you
no thank you
youre covered in soot from the
train you should take a bath
pajamas are on the
edge of the bed
you okay
you all right
i fell stupid tub
thats all right
youre circumcised
get out
move
last time
i measured walter
last time
i measured my son
he was inches taller
than you are now
who are you
what are you doing here
who are you
who are you
hes not my son
mrs collins
no i dont know why
hes saying that he is
but hes not walter
and theres been a mistake
i thought we agreed to
give him time to adjust
hes three inches shorter
i measured him
on the chart
well maybe your
measurements are off
look im sure theres a reasonable
explanation for all of this
hes circumcised
and walter isnt
mrs collins
your son was missing
for five months
for at least part of that time in the
company of an as yet unidentified drifter
who knows what such a disturbed
individual might have done
he could have had him circumcised
he could have
made him shorter
why arent you
listening to me
i am listening damn it
i am listening
and i understand
your feelings
hes changed no
mistake and thats
youve both been through
a terrible experience
and thats why he needs your
love and support to bounce back
hes not my son
why are you doing this
mrs collins
why are you doing this
you seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy
your job pays you enough to
attend to his personal needs
so i dont understand
why youre running away
from your responsibilities
as a mother
i am not running away
from anything
least of all
my responsibilities
i am even taking care
of that boy right now
because i am all he has
what worries me is that you
have stopped looking for my son
why should we be looking for
someone weve already found
because you have
not found him
his identity
has been confirmed
by the best minds in the
field of child identification
people who know
what theyre doing
and i dont
im sorry
i appreciate everything that
this department has done
and i know
how hard youre working
i really do and i dont
want to cause any trouble
i just
there has been a terrible mistake
and i need you to
help me correct it
so i can find my son
before its too late
please
i wont take up any more of your time
im sorry i got upset
im sorry very sorry
yes captain
sara get dr tarr
on the phone
yes sir
mrs collins
yes
dr earl w tarr
captain jones sent me
i consult with him from time
to time on juvenile cases
may i come in
yes thank you for coming
i was beginning to think
he didnt believe me
well im here now
and well put all that to rights
wheres the boy
ah there he is
a handsome young man
he has your eyes
doesnt he
and a little bit
of the nose
very fit in spite
of all his travails
a very resilient boy youve
got here mrs collins
i thought you were
here to help me
well i am
captain jones said that the boy had
been through some severe physical changes
and asked me
to drop in on him
to reassure you in your
time of motherly concern
my motherly concern is not for
him because hes not my son
now statements like that will
hardly help the boys selfesteem
now will they
captain jones said something
about a change in height
yes
come
against the wall
hes three inches shorter
ah well
hardly a mystery mrs collins
weve known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children
given the stress
of the past five months
his spine may have
actually shrunk
its uncommon but its within
the realm of possibility
and circumcision
very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate
after all circumcision
is hygienically sound
must have been quite
traumatic at the time
no wonder
hes submerged the memory
i
you see theres a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this
but its right for you
to raise the questions
you need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through
during his absence
wouldnt i know whether
or not hes my son
im the mother
which means youre in no
position to be objective
you are looking through the
prism of extreme emotion at a boy
who has changed
from what you remember
he isnt the same boy
that left here
just as a boy that goes
off to war and then returns
is not the same anymore
and a mothers heart driven
by intuition and emotion
sees these changes
and rebels
insists that
this isnt your son
doesnt change the facts
im willing to put my theory to the
test of objectivity mrs collins
are you
it is absolutely outrageous
calm yourself calm yourself
and just listen to me
no no no
no you listen to me please
this so called doctor paraded
me around my own neighborhood
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didnt even know her own son
and what was his findings
he found what he
expected to find
what you obviously
told him he would find
mrs collins
but thats not
thats nothing
to be embarrassed about
that i was embarrassed
is not the issue
the point is that
you are wasting time
when you should be
looking for my son
but the report is final
mrs collins
well then i want to receive
the report so i can refute it
before it goes
to anyone else
fine
yes good day
im finished could i
go to my room now
yes
good night mommy
stop saying that
stop saying that
im not your mother
i want my son back
youre not him
youre not my son
i want my son back
i want my son back
damn you
i want my son back
i was wrong
to yell at you
youre just a child
and i dont think you know
what youre doing
and the hurt
youre causing
but i need you to understand
that my son is my life
hes all i have
and no matter what the police think
and no matter what the world thinks
you and i
we both know the truth
dont we
we both know that
youre not walter
you just have to tell them
that youre not my son
so they can find my son
please
we can talk tomorrow
hello
is this mrs christine collins
yes
my name is gustav briegleb
im the pastor over at
st pauls presbyterian
oh yes ive heard
your broadcasts
im
thank you
have you read
the times this morning
no
well maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish
for breakfast in say an hour
i think we should meet
hello
mysterious case of
acting on the request of the
los angeles police department
dr earl w tarr child
specialist examined walter collins
to determine the cause
of his loss of weight
paleness confusion
and rundown condition
noticed since the
return of the boy
to his mother last monday
lovely bit of phrasing
isnt it
noticed since the return
of the boy to his mother
now not only does that clearly
state youre the boys mother
but one could infer from it that youre
somehow responsible for these changes
and that the police
department is concerned
for the boys welfare
while hes in your charge
you should try the eggs
theyre very nice
i examined the boy quite
thoroughly dr tarr said
and its clear that
he has something to tell
im sure that in time
time he will give his boyish
story of the entire affair
but not until he has
faith in his listener
and that is what is lacking here
faith in the poor lads story
course of my examination i found
nothing to dispute the findings
of the lapd
why would they do this
to avoid admitting
they made a mistake
when they brought
back the wrong boy
of course anyone reading the
newspaper with half a brain
would see
through it instantly
sadly that would exclude about half
the readership of the times
mrs collins i have made it my mission
in life to bring to light all the things
the lapd wish none
of us ever knew about
a department ruled by violence abuse
murder corruption and intimidation
when chief davis took over the
force two years ago he said
we will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of los angeles
i want them brought
in dead not alive
and i will reprimand any officer who
shows the least mercy to a criminal
he picked 50 of the most
violent cops on the force
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way
he called them
the gun squad
no lawyers no trials no questions
no suspensions no investigations
just piles of bodies
bodies in the morgues bodies in the
hospitals bodies by the side of the road
and not because the lapd
wanted to wipe out crime no
the lapd wanted to
wipe out the competition
mayor cryer and half
the force are on the take
gambling prostitution
bootlegging you name it
because once you give people the
freedom to do whatever they want
as the lord found in the garden
of eden they will do exactly that
this police department does not
tolerate dissent or contradiction
or even embarrassment
and you are in a position to
embarrass them and they do not like it
they will do anything in
their power to discredit you
ive seen that happen too many
times to start going blind now
thats why i wanted
to meet you
to let you know what
youre getting yourself into
and to help you fight it
if you choose to
reverend i appreciate
everything that youre doing
and everything
that you said
but im not on a mission
i just want my son home
mrs collins a lot
of mothers sons
have been sacrificed
to expediency around here
your son unfortunately
would not be the first
but if you do it right
he may very well be the last
he had two cavities
that needed filling
he put up a fight
but i took care of it
and
your sons upper front teeth were
separated by a small tissue a diastema
it made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart
the boy in that room
has no such gap
can that change with age because
thats what theyre gonna say
in some cases
yes its possible
but the tissue between walters
teeth prevents that from happening
see they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue
and i can tell you right now that
he has never had such an operation
would you be willing to put
that officially in writing
pardon my language
but hell yes
sounds like the
anesthetics wearing off
on the other hand maybe
ill write that letter first
give the little fella
something to think about
well if it is
hes changed enormously
do you know who i am
youre a teacher
yes but even teachers
have names whats mine
i dont remember
i know you but i dont
remember your name
mrs fox
now take your seat
i didnt say take a seat i said
take your seat the one assigned you
you must know where it is youve
been sitting in it for over a year now
mrs collins if thats your
son ill eat my yardstick
not only will i put it in writing i
will testify to it in a court of law
or to the president calvin
coolidge himself if i have to
thank you
ill see you tonight
for the broadcast
good luck
quick question maam
quick question
mrs collins
hello my name is
christine collins
good morning
good morning
on march 10th my nineyearold
son walter collins disappeared
and a fivemonth investigation
led to a boy being brought to
los angeles from dekalb illinois
they told me and all of you
that this boy was my son
he was not my son
the lapd made a mistake
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation
i have letters from his
teachers and his doctors
all confirming that
he is not my son
im having them reprinted now and
ill have them for you tomorrow
i have given the lapd every
opportunity to admit their mistake
and renew the
search for my son
since they have
refused to do so
it has forced me
to bring my case public
and i hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started
and bring my son home to me
thank you very much
morelli
i want you to find the
collins woman and get her here
and bill bring her
in the back way
yes sir
this way miss
why are we going
in the back
captains orders fronts
jammed with reporters
please sit down miss captain
jonesll be right with you
hey anyone want to take a call
from the canadian mounties ybarra
whatd they do
lose a moose
they need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to canada
hes living with his cousin on some
ranch near riverside in wineville
you want it
ill take it
got nothing better to do
youre a prince
mrs collins
you can leave the boy
shell take care of him
sit
oh youve caused us quite a
bit of trouble mrs collins
this situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department
it wasnt my intention
to embarrass anyone
oh no of course not
you just told the papers we couldnt
tell one boy from another as a compliment
for the months we spent
working on your case
you trying to make fools out of
us is that it you enjoy this
of course not
i want you to find my son
you know what your
problem is mrs collins
youre trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother
what
you enjoyed being a
free woman didnt you
you enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son
you could go where you
wanted do whatever you wanted
see anyone you wanted
but then we found your son
and we brought him back
and now hes an
inconvenience to you
and thats why you
cooked up this scheme
to throw him to the state and get
the state to raise him for you
isnt that true
that is not true
no well even the boy
says hes your son
why would he say that
how would he know
to do that
i dont know
i just know hes lying
oh maybe so
maybe he is a liar
but thats how hes
been trained isnt it
lying was born
in both of you
youre a liar and a
troublemaker and if you ask me
you got no business walking
the streets of los angeles
now wait a minute
because either
you know youre lying
or youre not capable of knowing if
youre lying or telling the truth
so which is it
you a derelict mother
or just plain nuts
cause from where i sit
those are the only options
im not gonna sit
here and take this
you want experts you want doctors
i have a few of my own
matron
mrs collins you still insist that
the boy out there is not your son
yes i do
please dont struggle
what
no
youll only hurt yourself
what are you doing
hold still
you cant just do this
no you cant
you are to convey the prisoner
to the los angeles county general
hospital psychopathic ward
what
you are to make
the following entry
defendant states shes been
deceived by police and others
and that we have given
her a boy and tried
to make her think it is her
son when she says it is not
take her away
no no no
please please
come on mrs collins
no no
this way
mrs collins has been known
to us since about march 10th 1928
when she reported her
nineyearold son walter missing
the boy was gone until august 1928
okay
since his return
she has complained that he is still missing
and has made repeated
requests that he be found
she suffers from paranoia delusions of
persecution and dislocation from reality
she may be a threat
to herself or others
we recommend that she be
conveyed to the psychopathic ward
until her senses
can be restored
got another code 12

christine
christine collins
now finish it all i know
its hard but you gotta try
oh boy
i heard them talking
youre here on code 12
police action
i mean the doctors
the staff they figure
that if the police
brought you here
there must be
a good reason for it
there isnt a good
reason for it
im perfectly sane and i
will explain that to them
how
the more you try to act sane
the crazier you start to look
if you smile too much youre
delusional or youre stifling hysteria
and if you dont smile
youre depressed
if you remain neutral youre emotionally
withdrawn potentially catatonic
youve given this
a lot of thought
yeah i have
dont you get it
youre a code 12
so am i
were here for the
exact same reasons
we both pissed
off the cops
now you see you
see that lady there
she was married to a cop
who kept beating her up
when she tried to tell somebody
about it he brought her here
i want more juice
and that one
put your tray
back where it belongs
the police beat the crap out of
her brother broke both his arms
when she tried to
tell the papers
and you
i work nights
sure
i mean i work nights
oh
yeah in the clubs
downtown
im sorry
yeah well this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldnt stop
so i filed a complaint
and it turns out
he was a cop
next thing i know
im here
but they cant do that
are you kidding
all right one
more and then thats it
everybody knows
women are fragile
i mean theyre all emotions no logic
theres nothing going on upstairs
somebody help me
every once in a while they say
something thats a little inconvenient
they just go fucking nuts
pardon my french
you gotta get those dishes
you got it
if were insane nobody
has to listen to us
i mean who are
you gonna believe
some crazy woman trying to
destroy the integrity of the force
or a police officer
then once they get us in here we
either shut up and we learn to behave
or we dont go home
are you all done
or we go home like that
stop stop it
stop it
stop it
please
clark
sanford clark
here
paperworks come through
youll be deported back to
canada day after tomorrow
police there will decide
what to do with you next
i hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border
illegally in the future
wait
id like to talk to the
officer who brought me in
im sure he has far
more important things
please its important
christine collins
thank you mrs collins
dr jonathan steele
please have a seat
i hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far
yes
really
id think itd
be quite difficult at first
yes it was
of course it was very difficult
but comfortable enough
i see that they have
theyve taken a blood test
the wassermman test
they said it was to check for
syphilis cause it affects the mind
the idea that someone thinks you
need to be checked for syphilis
does that upset you
no they said it was standard
procedure so it did not
yes exactly
standard procedure
we have to cover
all our bases
i can imagine
that for some people that
would be uncomfortable
but i understood
according to your file you
believe that the police substituted
a fake boy for your son
no i didnt say
he was a fake boy
hes not my boy
they brought home
the wrong boy
my son is still missing
well thats strange because
i have here a newspaper article
with a photo of you at the train
station welcoming home your son
that is you in the
photo isnt it
yes
yeah
yes
so at first
he was your son
and now hes not your son
has this
been going on for a long time
people changing becoming
something other than what they are
people dont change
you dont think
people change
no thats not
the police theyre not
out to persecute you
no theyre not
no theyre not
the police are here
to protect you
yes
really
yes
well thats odd because
when you were admitted
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you
so either the head nurse and the
interns are also conspiring to punish you
or youre changing
your story
do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy mrs collins
no
im sorry to bring you out
in this weather detective
but the boy has
been quite insistent
its all right
ill see what he has to say
so i can go home and get dry
its raining cats dogs
and democrats out there
so this had better
be worth it
you again huh
well see
well
this isnt easy okay
yeah
driving my ass here in the
pouring rain wasnt easy either
my cousin is
gordon northcott
he owns the ranch
where you found me
he said i could live there in exchange
i watch the place when hes gone
doing chores
and stuff like that
said i could stay as
long as i wanted to
i thought that meant i could
leave whenever i wanted
mmm
you saying that he
held you prisoner
bull
when i got there you were
running around free as a jaybird
couldve left any
time you wanted
no
so whats this huh
some kind of story to cover why
youre in the country illegally
no its nothing like that
cause i dont have
time for this okay
listen to me
he said
what
what did he say
he said that if i tried
to leave hed kill me
look you dont understand
what hes like
what he what we did
what he made me do
all right
lets start at
the beginning then
whatd he make you do
we killed some kids
what
look i didnt mean to i swear
he made me help him
he said if i didnt
hed kill me too
look you gotta help me
please im so scared
i dont want to go
to hell for killing kids
look

no youre lying
no its true i swear
youre gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids
yeah thereabouts
i stopped counting
after a while
gordon said maybe one
or two may have escaped
but
no
nobody can just up
and kill 20 kids okay
we did
we did
how
most times wed just
have one or two
sometimes as many as three
i always knew when we
were getting ready to leave
clean up the car
make sure the tires
were good
check the engine
cause he was afraid that
the car would break down
and wed get caught
my loving baby
wed always go a different
direction every time
never hit the same
part of town twice
sometimes wed just
drive around for hours
till we found somebody
well there you are
weve been looking
for you like mad
you have
sure thing
listen your folks
theyve been in an accident
and they sent us to come find
you now theyre hurt real bad
the police took them to the hospital but
they didnt have time to come find you
so we said that
we would do it
now come on
all right
get in here hurry
listen we gotta get you to that
hospital so you can see your folks
see a lot of kids wont
get in a car alone with a stranger
but when hes got
a kid there
theres a good boy
scoot over
scoot over san
that made it easier
i want you to hold on tight
theyd look
at me and say
weve got a long way to go
hey if hes safe
and we are gonna fly

and who is that is
that bakers file or larson
thats baker
he said he wanted
nurse i wanna see
every piece of paper you have on
the case of mrs christine collins
and i want to see it right
now do you understand me
every piece when
will she be coming out
oh its just up ahead
oh all right
lets
hurricane hits
west palm beach
babe ruth hits
53rd home run
kids found murdered in riverside
there it is
biggest crime
in los angeles history
collins boy assumed dead
read it here
read it here
mrs collins
im so sorry
captain your handling of
the christine collins case
has exposed this department
to public ridicule
there is even the possibility
of civil and criminal liability
sir nobody couldve known what
was happening up at that ranch
not us the sheriffs department
or the marshals office
and as for the
collins woman
im still not convinced that her boy
is among the victims up in wineville
no
no
there were four other photos of
missing boys that looked a lot like him
the clark kid
couldve been mistaken
maybe he was
which begs the obvious
question who cares
sir
the mayor wants
this to go away
i want this to go away
the way you do that is to stop
insisting that walter collins
is not among those boys killed
up at that goddamn ranch
because if the boy you brought
back is not walter collins
and hes not dead up at that
ranch then where the hell is he
people are gonna want to
know why we havent found him
why were not
doing our job
but if on the other hand
he is or could be among those
poor boys killed up in wineville
then the inquiries stop
its a momentary
embarrassment
youre just gonna
have to live with
better a short
inconvenience
than a lingering problem
wouldnt you say captain
yes sir
the boys been gone
nearly a year
if he was going to be found
it wouldve happened by now
whether he was up
at that ranch or not
the truth is he probably
is dead somewhere
better his mother accept that
now than later dont you think
yes sir
good
thatll be all captain
thats how you want it
then i guess were done here
tell county jail were
remanding him for trial
wait i didnt do anything i
wasnt even here when it happened
by pretending to
be walter collins
youre interfering in a police
investigation of a kidnapping and murder
we can try you as accomplice
to that murder after the fact
thats too bad
county jail is a lot worse than
a juvenile hall or a foster home
its a lot worse
you cant do that
im just a kid
sanford clarks a kid too
fifteen
hes going to jail
all murderers and their accomplices
go to jail everybody knows that
get him out of here
its out of my hands now
wait i dont
want to go to jail
prove it
i
i knew los angeles is where
they make the tom mix movies
i figured
if i could meet tom mix
maybe he would let me
ride on his horse
his horse is named tony
did you know that
how are you feeling
all right
the police still
have a car outside
i guess theyre waiting to see
what your next move is going to be
im going home
and then
then ive been giving it
a lot of thought
and what they did to those women
and what they did about walter
i used to always tell him you never
start a fight but you always finish it
and i didnt start this
fight but im gonna finish it
mrs collins right now youre a
sufficiently high profile that i think
even the police would hesitate
to go after you out in the open
but i have to warn you that
could change very quickly
if they feel their
position threatened
very quickly indeed
what are they gonna
do to me now
they got nothing
im going home
hi sis
gordon
i didnt know
you were back in town
yeah i got in
a couple of days ago
figured id surprise you
is that is that okay
yes yes of course
of course come on in
wheres that
little niece of mine
she went into town
should be back this evening
uh bobs here
oh good
uh i was gonna ask if i
could stay on a couple days
staying
yeah
listen can i use
your bathroom
its been a long ride and
i could really use a shower
of course
okay
thank you
is that
all right go next door
ill call the police hurry
operator
how may i connect you
hes upstairs sir
go around the other side
cut him off
come with me
yes sir
lets go
mrs collins id like you
to meet my friend mr hahn
mrs collins my deepest
condolences on your loss
may we come in
i appreciate the sentiment
but theyve yet to find
to identify the
remains as my son
im afraid it never
gets any easier
i lost a daughter
to polio five years ago
theres not a day goes by
when i dont think
i should mention
this to claudine
then i remember
shes not here
please sit
ive been on the phone
all morning
with the appointment secretary
of the police commission
they said that they
wont let me testify
at the hearing or call witnesses
that it wont be necessary
i know my sources say
the police commission
is going to say that jones and the
lapd did absolutely nothing wrong
and that the real blame lies
with the kid and with you
for being difficult and forcing them
to put you away for your own safety
then i guess i would have to
hire a lawyer file a civil suit
i went to the best
attorney in town
a man whos sued this
city four times and won
unfortunately we cant
afford to really hire him
i see
which is why
im doing this pro bono
it would be my honor to defend
your honor mrs collins
in my 15 years as a lawyer
i have never seen anyone fight
as long or as hard as you have
in what is so clearly
in the cause of justice
thank you
let me see
whats on the shelf
ill look
yes may i
my name is ss hahn
and i have a court order for the immediate
release of all women being detained
in this institution under
the designation code 12
pending a formal inquiry into
the reasons for their detainment
im sorry the doctor
in charge is not here
until the morning
madam let me be clearer
either you will produce the
people named in that court order
or you will find yourself behind
bars and i mean without a key
i cant authorize you
madam stand aside
can i see her now
sure absolutely
how does she look
all right fellas
step back lets give him room
here he is
mr northcott
any comment on your arrest
mr northcott
how are you feeling
oh im feeling fine
ive been on a little
vacation as some of you know
it was
a really pleasant vacation
the police have certainly provided
me with a lot of amusement
how long
you been in hiding
how did you
avoid capture
easy easy
thats far enough
well i didnt did i
one more shot
have you seen
your picture in the paper
didnt know anybody
wanted me until just recently
didnt even try
my luggage still has
my initials on it fellas
did you know why
the police were after you
no but i figured itd be a good
idea if i were to just stay out of it
any remorse sir
do you have anything to say to
the parents of the children you murdered
no comment
one more shot
this way
mayor cryer
this is unexpected
so was this
subpoenas requests for
depositions interrogatories
all courtesy of mr hahn and his
new client christine collins
you dont have to look them
over too closely chief
your own copies should
be coming any time now
the city council has also
agreed to look into this
starting immediately
god damn it
i thought this was
supposed to go away
this is an election year
i cant afford
this kind of press
it is going away sir ive instructed
captain jones to deal with it
im afraid
falling on his sword
and saying he made a mistake isnt
going to be good enough chief
if we take him out of
the picture for a while
just might help calm things down
until the hearings finished
what is happening
didnt you hear
its the biggest protest
ive ever seen
protest
yeah
over the collins broad
if you can believe that
we want
justice we want justice
oh my
mr harris
the lord works in mysterious
ways mrs collins
boy does he ever
ladies and gentlemen can
i have your attention please
there are more people gathered in this chamber
than have ever been in this room before
therefore i ask you to refrain
from demonstrations of any kind
tell the truth tell the truth
we are all here because we want to
know the real facts in this case
and everybody is going to be heard
if we have to sit here for a week
mr thorpe i dont see any
members of the police commission
are there any members of
the police department in the room
is chief davis here
is captain jones here
is there anybody here
representing the police
mrs collins could you come across
the street with me for just a moment
theres something
i think you should see
well i hate to call a
recess before weve even started
but i think a few
phone calls are in order
the police decided itd be best
to keep this off the main docket
in order to avoid exactly the sort
of chaos we have across the street
mrs collins
im leanne clay
this is my husband john
hi
i just wanted to pass
along my sympathies
what we went through
waiting to hear anything
about our son david
was bad enough now this
but what the police did to
you there was no call for that
no call at all
all rise
please be seated
bailiff
oh hey
i saw you in the papers
you got a lot of moxie standing
up to the police like that
the defendant
will please rise
gordon stewart northcott
youve been charged with three
counts of murder in the first degree
with an additional 17 counts under
review by the district attorneys office
how do you plea
oh not guilty your honor
you may sit mr northcott
in light of the defendants penchant for
international travel no bail will be set
this court will hear preliminary
motions by tomorrow morning
the boy walter collins
was reported as missing
march 10 1928
we then instituted
a nationwide search
on august 18th we received
a cable indicating that a boy
matching his description was
found in dekalb illinois
upon questioning he admitted
to being walter collins
we then made arrangements for him
to be transported back to california
where mrs collins told you
the boy was not her son
yes she denied
his identity
in spite of all of the evidence
pointing to the contrary
but as subsequent
events have demonstrated
she was correct
so what prompted
you to send her
for psychological
evaluation
whether or not this was
in fact the correct boy
was not relevant
to my decision
throughout this period
she acted strangely
she was often cool
and aloof and unemotional
especially when confronted
with the boy we found in dekalb
and in our
subsequent conversation
it was because of her
disturbing behavior that i
submitted her for observation
to the psychopathic ward of los
angeles county general hospital
just like that
you snap your fingers
and an innocent woman
is thrown
into the psycho ward
she wasnt thrown every family
in this state is in grave danger
when a police captain can
take a woman into his office
and five minutes later
have her thrown into the psychopathic
ward on his own authority
she wasnt thrown
she wasnt thrown
she wasnt thrown
what was that captain
she wasnt thrown
she was escorted
escorted thrown the verb
doesnt matter captain
what does matter is that her incarceration
was ordered without a warrant
i am holding a carbon copy
of the affidavit of insanity
that was issued in the case
of the state of california
v christine collins
who signed the affidavit
i did
well now let me see
if i have this correct
a woman was thrown into the
psychopathic ward without a warrant
because no warrant existed
and when it was finally
written several days later
there was no need to sign it
or to go to a judge
because she was already
in the asylum
is this correct captain
technically yes
extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing
we were dealing with
an extraordinary situation
now is it our fault
that we were being deceived
by a boy who claimed to
be walter collins no
in light of his claims
and her disturbing behavior
who wouldnt begin to think that there
was something the matter with her
because she questioned you
no because
she wouldnt listen
because she insisted
on being obstinate
because she tried to take
matters into her own hand
best left to
qualified officers
because once
civil disobedience starts
because she was fighting
for the life of her son
a boy who may have
still been alive
while you were wasting valuable time
denying you had done anything wrong
and in the end
thats what
happened isnt it
at some point while
all this was going on
walter collins
was brutally murdered
along with as many
as 19 other boys
at the northcott ranch
in wineville
is that correct captain
yes it is
its a travesty
no further questions
train number 14
now boarding on track
so after much effort we
were able to identify this boy
whos been responsible
for so much trouble lately
as arthur hutchins
of cedar rapids iowa
between this and the arrest of
the man suspected of murdering
the real walter collins
weve cleared up two of the biggest
mysteries in the history of los angeles
i hope you gentlemen
of the press will give
as much space to the
good things we do
as the mistakes that are
made on rare occasions
gentlemen allow me
to introduce you
to the boys real mother
mrs janet hutchins
arthur
i hope he wasnt too
much trouble for you
oh no not at all
how about
a photograph fellas
one more
mrs hutchins
mrs collins the woman he was
staying with wanted him to have these
theyre the clothes
she let him wear
well thank you
isnt that nice arthur
tell the nice officer
thank you
i dont want them
give them to somebody else
precocious
little fellow isnt he
its not my fault
its the police
they said i was walter collins
not me it wasnt my idea
not my idea
get
yeah go blame the police
for your own mistakes
weve seen a lot of
that lately havent we
take care now arthur
safe travels
all right fellas
thats it for today
sir sir what
did the boy mean by that
it was march 10th and
i came home from work
and my nineyearold
son walter was gone
captain jones was acting on
information he believed to be correct
walter collins had a diastema
also known as a diastema
that child was never
in my classroom
i can certainly
attest to that
we rely on our good
friends in the police department
to point to us those
people who exhibit behavior
which is socially
unacceptable
about four inches
shorter than the last mark of walter
well some of
these pictures show
what sanford clark
told me
that he did in fact help in
the murder of these children
thank you detective
gentlemen of the jury
i ask you to take a good
look at these images
they establish beyond
any reasonable doubt
the circumstances and the
nature of these heinous crimes
im in here
reverend
when walter was here i
used to walk by his room
when he was sleeping
and even though i couldnt
see him or hear him
i could feel him
thats why i dont
think walters dead
i can still feel him
mrs collins
no
i know what
the police said
but that place
and the remains
they couldnt be
properly identified
and maybe that kid made a mistake
when he picked walters picture
i understand you dont
want to accept this
what mother would
but i think its time
for you to move on
and start over
for yourself
your son would
want you to move on
maybe
maybe hed want me
to keep looking for him
maybe hes somewhere
waiting for me
i believe he is
waiting maam
hes waiting in
that place where
well all go someday to be
reunited with our loved ones
and on that day hell know
from front to back end to end
heart to soul that you did
everything you could mrs collins
everything
we should go maam
one minute
this meeting will
now come to order
this committee has now
heard all of the testimony
and in light of
the facts presented
we recommend that the
suspension of captain jones
be made permanent
order please please
mr foreman
has the jury
reached a verdict
we have your honor
will the defendant
please rise
second that steps be taken
to investigate a change
in the prevailing laws and
procedures by which a citizen
of this city can be
subjected to incarceration
in the countys
mental facilities
you may read the verdict
we the jury find the defendant
gordon stewart northcott
guilty on all counts of
murder in the first degree
finally restoration of public
confidence in the police department
can only be achieved
by the removal of
its chief of police
and this committee
so recommends
this hearing
is concluded
does the defendant wish to make a
statement before judgment is passed
i want to make
it real clear
that i never once got
a fair shake from you
your honor
or from this court
the only one in here worth
a good goddamn is her
cause shes the only one who
never badmouthed me to the press
shes the only one
who understands
what it is to be
framed by the police
for something you didnt
do all right thats enough
and then to just be
thrown in the hole
to just rot and to fester
and to be forgotten
and fade away isnt that right
gordon
counsel
isnt it
i never killed your boy
mrs collins
counsel thats enough
i would never do that
i would never
hurt walter
counsel get control
of your client
or ill have him
bound and gagged
hes an angel
come on gordon
get off of me
now get down
gordon stewart northcott
it is the judgment
of this court
that you be conveyed
to san quentin prison
where youll be held in solitary
confinement for a period of two years
until october 2 1930
on that date you will be
hanged by the neck until dead
may god have
mercy on your soul
is it all right if i
have a 10minute break
of course
you know
one of these days you might
actually consider taking
one of these
10minute breaks
it might be
good for you
well see
this is
christine collins
i called yesterday
i was wondering if you had a
chance to look through the files
and see if there was a match
to my son walter collins

ill call back in a
month thank you very much
mrs collins
i was just
yes i know

we had a
well we received
a very strange telegram
from who
gordon northcott
hes asked to see you
why
he said he knows youre
still looking for your son
and before he dies
he says he lied when he testified
that he didnt kill walter
christine hes willing to
finally admit that he did it
he says if you come up
to see him in person
then hell tell you
the truth to your face
so that you can get
on with your life
and have some peace
as you know hes
set to be executed
the day after tomorrow
at san quentin

so what happened
after that
i kept off
the main roads
until i saw a train stopped
at a crossing and i jumped in
why didnt you tell
anyone what had happened
i was afraid
i thought theyd come
after me or my folks
so i just didnt
tell anybody
i was on my own until i got a free
meal from this lady miss lansing
told her i was an
orphan on my own
she said i could stay on
and i did
every night
id wake up thinking they
were right outside my window
and then i heard the
police talking on the radio
about what happened
at the ranch
and i thought for sure
i cant go back now
why
why not
since i didnt tell
anybody what happened
i was afraid theyd blame
me for those kids being dead
so i just stayed away
what made you come forward
now after all this time
hmm why come
forward now
i really miss my mom
i really miss my dad
i just wanna go home
i just wanna go home
are you all right
i love you
i still cant believe it
five years case closed everyone
thinks hes dead and there he is
wouldnt be if it
wasnt for walter
your son did a brave
thing mrs collins
you should be
very proud of him
i am
you still think
hes out there
why not
three boys made a run for
it that night detective
and if one got out
then maybe either or both
of the others did too
maybe walters out there having
the same fears that he did
afraid to come home
and identify himself
or afraid hell get
into trouble
but either way
