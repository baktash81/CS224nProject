the police station 
i ll connect you 
lincoln heights division 
hello  my name is
christine collins 
i live at 210
north avenue  23 
and i m calling
to report a missing child 
missing child 
what s your relation
to the child  ma am 
it s my son 
how long has he been gone 
i m not sure 
i just got home from work 
it could be
since this morning
or it could be
just the last hour 
have you checked
around the neighborhood 
yes  of course i did 
well  maybe
he s lost track of time 
no  no  no 
he always stays around the
house when it gets dark 
would you please send
someone down here 
i m sorry 
but our policy is that
we don t dispatch units
on missing child cases for 24 hours 
what 
look  99 times out of 100 
the kid shows up by morning 
we don t have the resources to go chasing
every kid who runs off with his pals 
no  no  no 
no  that s not walter 
he doesn t do that 
with all due respect  ma am 
every parent who calls says the same thing 
please  please 
look  there s
nothing i can do 
i ll take your name
and your information 
but that s all until the morning 
at the earliest 
i m sure he ll show up by then 
they always do 
are you mrs  collins 
our thoughts go out
again today to mrs  christine collins
of lincoln heights 
whose young son 
walter collins 
disappeared
nearly two weeks ago 
though she is not
a member of our congregation 
we pray for her today
as we have every day 
since we learned
of her plight 
on the radio and
in the newspapers
we are told that
the los angeles police department
is doing its very best to
reunite mother and child 
and i m sure
that that is true 
but given its status
as the most violent  corrupt
and incompetent
police department
this side
of the rocky mountains
i am not sure
it s saying a great deal 
every day  new bodies
appear along mulholland
and in the ditches
of our cities 
the work of police chief james davis
and his aptly named gun squad 
every day  the needs
of honest citizens
are put second to greed
and personal gain 
every day 
this city sinks deeper into a cesspool
of fear  intimidation
and corruption 
once the city of angels 
los angeles has become
a place where our protectors
have become
our brutalizers 
where to be the law is
to be above the law 
i understand 
thank you 
i will call back
in a few weeks 
thank you very much 
las vegas missing
persons department 
hello  this is
christine collins

little lady with her son 
so if you ll excuse us 
stay right there 
come on  don t rush 
easy  easy 
mrs  collins  i d like to
introduce you to james e  davis 
chief of police 
very nice to meet you 
we don t get a lot
of positive attention
from the boys in the
press these days 
so it s good to be here with a
positive story  don t you think 
yes  sir 
i take it you ve been treated
well by my boys in the department 
i couldn t file a
report for 24 hours 
and i thought that
maybe that was a   
technicalities aside 
it was wonderful 
well  good 
then you won t have any trouble
telling that to the press 
and the fact that the lapd   
women 
hold on a second 
back  boys  back 
keep them back 
well  aren t you   
aren t you gonna   
that s not my son 
what 
what are you saying 
it s not my son 
well  i m sure
you re mistaken 
i m not mistaken 
well  he s been through
five terrible long months 
he s lost weight 
he s changed 
i would know my own son 
all i m saying is you re
in shock and he s changed 
what s your name 
can you tell me your name 
walter collins 
it s a common name 
where do you live  walter 
you know your home address 
i live at 210 avenue 23 
los angeles  california 
and that s my mommy 
mrs  collins  listen
to me  i understand 
you re feeling a little uncertain
right now  and that s to be expected 
a boy this age 
he changes so fast 
we ve compensated for that
in our investigation 
and there s no question
that this is your son 
that is not walter 
it s not walter
as you remember him 
and that s why it s important for
you to take him home on a trial basis 
a trial basis 
yes  yes 
once he s around his
familiar surroundings 
and you ve given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition 
you will see that
this is your walter 
now  i promise you  i swear
to you  i give you my word 
this is your son 
now  if you have any problems  any problems
at all  you come and you talk to me 
i ll take care of it 
i give you my word 
trust me 
mrs  collins  he has
nowhere else to go 
please 
maybe i m not
thinking clearly 
and   
all right 
all right  you re not
thinking clearly  that s right 
here we go 
thank you 
thank you 
here  just turn
around here 
how does it feel to have
your son home  mrs  collins 
what d you think when you
saw him for the first time 
it s hard to explain 
she was
shocked at first 
she didn t recognize the boy 
which is perfectly natural 
he s been through
quite an ordeal 
how re you feeling  son 
bet it feels great
to be home 
yeah  it s great 
the los angeles
police department is thankful
for all the hard work done by the
dekalb county sheriff s department
in making this joyful
reunion possible 
the lapd is dedicated to
serving the public at all times 
can we get a photo with
mother and son  captain 
absolutely  here we are 
like that 
like that 
squeeze together 
there you go  boys 
this way  walter 
  big smile 
one more  please 
  that s a good one 
one more 
the sandwich all right 
would you like
some more milk 
no 
no  thank you 
no  thank you 
you re covered in soot from the
train  you should take a bath 
pajamas are on the
edge of the bed 
you okay 
you all right 
i fell  stupid tub 
that s all right 
you re circumcised 
get out 
move 
last time
i measured walter 
last time
i measured my son 
he was inches taller
than you are now 
who are you 
what are you doing here 
who are you 
who are you 
he s not my son 
mrs  collins   
no  i don t know why
he s saying that he is 
but he s not walter
and there s been a mistake 
i thought we agreed to
give him time to adjust 
he s three inches shorter 
i measured him
on the chart 
well  maybe your
measurements are off 
look  i m sure there s a reasonable
explanation for all of this 
he s circumcised 
and walter isn t 
mrs  collins 
your son was missing
for five months 
for at least part of that time in the
company of an as yet unidentified drifter 
who knows what such a disturbed
individual might have done 
he could have had him circumcised 
he could have   
made him shorter 
why aren t you
listening to me 
i am listening  damn it 
i am listening 
and i understand
your feelings 
he s changed  no
mistake  and that s   
you ve both been through
a terrible experience 
and that s why he needs your
love and support to bounce back 
he s not my son 
why are you doing this 
mrs  collins 
why are you doing this 
you seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy 
your job pays you enough to
attend to his personal needs 
so i don t understand
why you re running away
from your responsibilities
as a mother 
i am not running away
from anything 
least of all
my responsibilities 
i am even taking care
of that boy right now 
because i am all he has 
what worries me is that you
have stopped looking for my son 
why should we be looking for
someone we ve already found 
because you have
not found him 
his identity
has been confirmed
by the best minds in the
field of child identification 
people who know
what they re doing 
and i don t 
i m sorry 
i appreciate everything that
this department has done
and i know
how hard you re working 
i really do  and i don t
want to cause any trouble 
i just   
there has been a terrible mistake 
and i need you to
help me correct it 
so i can find my son
before it s too late 
please 
i won t take up any more of your time 
i m sorry i got upset 
i m sorry  very sorry 
yes  captain 
sara  get dr  tarr
on the phone 
yes  sir 
mrs  collins 
  yes 
dr  earl w  tarr 
captain jones sent me 
i consult with him from time
to time on juvenile cases 
may i come in 
yes  thank you for coming 
i was beginning to think
he didn t believe me 
well  i m here now 
and we ll put all that to rights 
where s the boy 
ah  there he is 
a handsome young man 
he has your eyes 
doesn t he 
and a little bit
of the nose 
very fit  in spite
of all his travails 
a very resilient boy you ve
got here  mrs  collins 
i thought you were
here to help me 
well  i am 
captain jones said that the boy had
been through some severe physical changes
and asked me
to drop in on him
to reassure you in your
time of motherly concern 
my motherly concern is not for
him because he s not my son 
now  statements like that will
hardly help the boy s self esteem 
now will they 
captain jones said something
about a change in height 
yes 
come 
against the wall 
he s three inches shorter 
ah  well   
hardly a mystery  mrs  collins 
we ve known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children 
given the stress
of the past five months 
his spine may have
actually shrunk 
it s uncommon  but it s within
the realm of possibility 
and circumcision 
very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate 
after all  circumcision
is hygienically sound 
must have been quite
traumatic at the time 
no wonder
he s submerged the memory 
i   
you see  there s a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this 
but it s right for you
to raise the questions 
you need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through
during his absence 
wouldn t i know whether
or not he s my son 
i m the mother 
which means you re in no
position to be objective 
you are looking through the
prism of extreme emotion at a boy
who has changed
from what you remember 
he isn t the same boy
that left here 
just as a boy that goes
off to war and then returns
is not the same anymore 
and a mother s heart  driven
by intuition and emotion 
sees these changes
and rebels 
insists that
this isn t your son 
doesn t change the facts 
i m willing to put my theory to the
test of objectivity  mrs  collins 
are you 
it is absolutely outrageous 
calm yourself  calm yourself
and just listen to me 
no  no  no 
no  you listen to me  please 
this so called doctor paraded
me around my own neighborhood 
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didn t even know her own son 
and what was his findings 
he found what he
expected to find 
what you obviously
told him he would find 
mrs  collins 
  but that s not   
that s nothing
to be embarrassed about 
that i was embarrassed
is not the issue 
the point is that
you are wasting time
when you should be
looking for my son 
but the report is final 
mrs  collins 
well  then i want to receive
the report  so i can refute it 
before it goes
to anyone else 
fine 
yes  good day 
i m finished  could i
go to my room now 
yes 
good night  mommy 
stop saying that 
stop saying that 
i m not your mother 
i want my son back 
you re not him 
you re not my son 
i want my son back 
i want my son back 
damn you 
i want my son back 
i was wrong
to yell at you 
you re just a child
and i don t think you know
what you re doing 
and the hurt
you re causing 
but i need you to understand
that my son is my life 
he s all i have 
and no matter what the police think 
and no matter what the world thinks 
you and i 
we both know the truth 
don t we 
we both know that
you re not walter 
you just have to tell them
that you re not my son 
so they can find my son 
please 
we can talk tomorrow 
hello 
is this mrs  christine collins 
yes 
my name is gustav briegleb 
i m the pastor over at
st  paul s presbyterian 
oh  yes  i ve heard
your broadcasts 
i m   
thank you 
have you read
the times this morning 
no 
well  maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish
for breakfast  in  say  an hour 
i think we should meet 
hello 
 mysterious case of   
 acting on the request of the
los angeles police department 
 dr  earl w  tarr  child
specialist  examined walter collins
 to determine the cause
of his loss of weight 
 paleness  confusion 
and rundown condition
 noticed since the
return of the boy
 to his mother last monday  
lovely bit of phrasing 
isn t it 
noticed since the return
of the boy to his mother 
now  not only does that clearly
state you re the boy s mother 
but one could infer from it that you re
somehow responsible for these changes 
and that the police
department is concerned
for the boy s welfare
while he s in your charge 
you should try the eggs 
they re very nice 
  i examined the boy quite
thoroughly   dr  tarr said 
  and it s clear that
he has something to tell 
  i m sure that in time     
   time he will give his boyish
story of the entire affair 
but not until he has
faith in his listener 
and that is what is lacking here 
faith in the poor lad s story 
course of my examination  i found
nothing to dispute the findings
of the lapd 
why would they do this 
to avoid admitting
they made a mistake
when they brought
back the wrong boy 
of course  anyone reading the
newspaper with half a brain
would see
through it instantly 
sadly  that would exclude about half
the readership of the times 
mrs  collins  i have made it my mission
in life to bring to light all the things
the lapd wish none
of us ever knew about 
a department ruled by violence  abuse 
murder  corruption and intimidation 
when chief davis took over the
force two years ago  he said   
we will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of los angeles 
i want them brought
in dead  not alive 
and i will reprimand any officer who
shows the least mercy to a criminal 
he picked 50 of the most
violent cops on the force 
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way 
he called them
the gun squad 
no lawyers  no trials  no questions 
no suspensions  no investigations 
just piles of bodies 
bodies in the morgues  bodies in the
hospitals  bodies by the side of the road 
and not because the lapd
wanted to wipe out crime  no 
the lapd wanted to
wipe out the competition 
mayor cryer and half
the force are on the take 
gambling  prostitution 
bootlegging  you name it 
because once you give people the
freedom to do whatever they want 
as the lord found in the garden
of eden  they will do exactly that 
this police department does not
tolerate dissent  or contradiction 
or even embarrassment 
and you are in a position to
embarrass them and they do not like it 
they will do anything in
their power to discredit you 
i ve seen that happen too many
times to start going blind now 
that s why i wanted
to meet you 
to let you know what
you re getting yourself into
and to help you fight it 
if you choose to 
reverend  i appreciate
everything that you re doing
and everything
that you said 
but i m not on a mission 
i just want my son home 
mrs  collins  a lot
of mothers  sons
have been sacrificed
to expediency around here 
your son  unfortunately 
would not be the first 
but if you do it right 
he may very well be the last 
he had two cavities
that needed filling 
he put up a fight 
but i took care of it 
and 
your son s upper front teeth were
separated by a small tissue  a diastema 
it made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart 
the boy in that room
has no such gap 
can that change with age  because
that s what they re gonna say 
in some cases 
yes  it s possible 
but the tissue between walter s
teeth prevents that from happening 
see  they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue 
and i can tell you right now that
he has never had such an operation 
would you be willing to put
that officially in writing 
pardon my language 
but hell yes 
sounds like the
anesthetic s wearing off 
on the other hand  maybe
i ll write that letter first 
give the little fella
something to think about 
well  if it is 
he s changed enormously 
do you know who i am 
you re a teacher 
yes  but even teachers
have names  what s mine 
i don t remember 
i know you  but i don t
remember your name 
mrs  fox 
now  take your seat 
i didn t say take a seat  i said
take your seat  the one assigned you 
you must know where it is  you ve
been sitting in it for over a year now 
mrs  collins  if that s your
son  i ll eat my yardstick 
not only will i put it in writing  i
will testify to it in a court of law
or to the president calvin
coolidge himself if i have to 
thank you 
i ll see you tonight
for the broadcast 
good luck 
quick question  ma am 
quick question 
mrs  collins 
hello  my name is
christine collins 
good morning 
  good morning 
on march 10th  my nine year old
son  walter collins  disappeared 
and a five month investigation
led to a boy being brought to
los angeles from dekalb  illinois 
they told me and all of you
that this boy was my son 
he was not my son 
the lapd made a mistake 
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation 
i have letters from his
teachers and his doctors
all confirming that
he is not my son 
i m having them reprinted now  and
i ll have them for you tomorrow 
i have given the lapd every
opportunity to admit their mistake
and renew the
search for my son 
since they have
refused to do so 
it has forced me
to bring my case public 
and i hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started
and bring my son home to me 
thank you very much 
morelli 
i want you to find the
collins woman and get her here 
and  bill  bring her
in the back way 
yes  sir 
this way  miss 
why are we going
in the back 
captain s orders  front s
jammed with reporters 
please  sit down  miss  captain
jones ll be right with you 
hey  anyone want to take a call
from the canadian mounties  ybarra 
what d they do 
lose a moose 
they need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to canada 
he s living with his cousin on some
ranch near riverside  in wineville 
you want it 
  i ll take it 
got nothing better to do 
you re a prince 
mrs  collins 
you can leave the boy 
she ll take care of him 
sit 
oh  you ve caused us quite a
bit of trouble  mrs  collins 
this situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department 
it wasn t my intention
to embarrass anyone 
oh  no  of course not 
you just told the papers we couldn t
tell one boy from another as a compliment
for the months we spent
working on your case 
you trying to make fools out of
us  is that it  you enjoy this 
of course not 
i want you to find my son 
you know what your
problem is  mrs  collins 
you re trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother 
what 
you enjoyed being a
free woman  didn t you 
you enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son 
you could go where you
wanted  do whatever you wanted 
see anyone you wanted 
but then we found your son 
and we brought him back 
and now he s an
inconvenience to you 
and that s why you
cooked up this scheme 
to throw him to the state and get
the state to raise him for you 
isn t that true 
  that is not true 
no  well  even the boy
says he s your son 
why would he say that 
how would he know
to do that 
i don t know 
i just know he s lying 
oh  maybe so 
maybe he is a liar 
but that s how he s
been trained  isn t it 
lying was born
in both of you 
you re a liar and a
troublemaker and  if you ask me 
you got no business walking
the streets of los angeles 
now wait a minute 
because either
you know you re lying 
or you re not capable of knowing if
you re lying or telling the truth 
so  which is it 
you a derelict mother 
or just plain nuts 
 cause from where i sit 
those are the only options 
i m not gonna sit
here and take this 
you want experts  you want doctors 
i have a few of my own 
matron 
mrs  collins  you still insist that
the boy out there is not your son 
yes  i do 
please  don t struggle 
  what 
no 
  you ll only hurt yourself 
what are you doing 
  hold still 
you can t just do this 
no  you can t 
you are to convey the prisoner
to the los angeles county general
hospital psychopathic ward 
what 
you are to make
the following entry 
defendant states she s been
deceived by police and others 
and that we have given
her a boy and tried
to make her think it is her
son when she says it is not 
take her away 
  no  no  no 
please  please 
come on  mrs  collins 
no  no 
this way 
mrs  collins has been known
to us since about march 10th  1928
when she reported her
nine year old son  walter  missing 
the boy was gone until august 1928 
  okay 
since his return 
she has complained that he is still missing
and has made repeated
requests that he be found 
she suffers from paranoia  delusions of
persecution and dislocation from reality 
she may be a threat
to herself or others 
we recommend that she be
conveyed to the psychopathic ward
until her senses
can be restored 
got another code 12

i m not hungry 
barbara  you have to eat now 
  i m not hungry 
my name s carol dexter 
what s yours 
christine 
christine collins 
now  finish it all  i know
it s hard  but you gotta try 
oh  boy 
i heard them talking 
you re here on code 12 
police action 
i mean  the doctors 
the staff  they figure
that if the police
brought you here 
there must be
a good reason for it 
there isn t a good
reason for it 
i m perfectly sane and i
will explain that to them 
how 
the more you try to act sane 
the crazier you start to look 
if you smile too much  you re
delusional or you re stifling hysteria 
and if you don t smile 
you re depressed 
if you remain neutral  you re emotionally
withdrawn  potentially catatonic 
you ve given this
a lot of thought 
yeah  i have 
don t you get it 
you re a code 12 
so am i 
we re here for the
exact same reasons 
we both pissed
off the cops 
now  you see  you
see that lady there 
she was married to a cop
who kept beating her up 
when she tried to tell somebody
about it  he brought her here 
i want more juice 
and that one 
put your tray
back where it belongs 
the police beat the crap out of
her brother  broke both his arms 
when she tried to
tell the papers   
and you 
i work nights 
sure 
i mean  i work nights 
oh 
yeah  in the clubs 
downtown 
i m sorry 
yeah  well  this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldn t stop 
so i filed a complaint 
and it turns out
he was a cop 
next thing i know 
i m here 
but they can t do that 
are you kidding 
all right  one
more and then that s it 
everybody knows
women are fragile 
i mean  they re all emotions  no logic 
there s nothing going on upstairs 
somebody  help me 
every once in a while they say
something that s a little inconvenient 
they just go fucking nuts 
pardon my french 
you gotta get those dishes 
  you got it 
if we re insane  nobody
has to listen to us 
i mean  who are
you gonna believe 
some crazy woman trying to
destroy the integrity of the force 
or a police officer 
then once they get us in here  we
either shut up and we learn to behave 
or we don t go home 
are you all done 
or we go home like that 
stop  stop it 
stop it 
stop it 
please 
clark 
sanford clark 
here 
paperwork s come through 
you ll be deported back to
canada day after tomorrow 
police there will decide
what to do with you next 
i hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border
illegally in the future 
wait 
i d like to talk to the
officer who brought me in 
i m sure he has far
more important things   
please  it s important 
christine collins 
thank you  mrs  collins 
dr  jonathan steele 
please  have a seat 
i hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far 
yes 
really 
i d think it d
be quite difficult at first 
yes  it was 
of course it was very difficult 
but comfortable enough 
i see that they have   
they ve taken a blood test 
the wassermman test 
they said it was to check for
syphilis   cause it affects the mind 
the idea that someone thinks you
need to be checked for syphilis 
does that upset you 
no  they said it was standard
procedure  so it did not 
yes  exactly 
standard procedure 
we have to cover
all our bases 
i can imagine
that for some people that
would be uncomfortable 
but i understood 
according to your file you
believe that the police substituted
a fake boy for your son 
no  i didn t say
he was a fake boy 
he s not my boy 
they brought home
the wrong boy 
my son is still missing 
well  that s strange  because
i have here a newspaper article
with a photo of you at the train
station  welcoming home your son 
that is you in the
photo  isn t it 
yes 
yeah 
yes 
so  at first
he was your son 
and now he s not your son 
has this
been going on for a long time 
people changing  becoming
something other than what they are 
people don t change 
you don t think
people change 
no  that s not   
the police  they re not
out to persecute you 
no  they re not 
no  they re not 
the police are here
to protect you 
yes 
really 
yes 
well  that s odd because
when you were admitted 
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you 
so  either the head nurse and the
interns are also conspiring to punish you
or you re changing
your story 
do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy  mrs  collins 
no 
i m sorry to bring you out
in this weather  detective 
but the boy has
been quite insistent 
it s all right 
i ll see what he has to say
so i can go home and get dry 
it s raining cats  dogs 
and democrats out there 
so this had better
be worth it 
you again  huh 
we ll see 
well 
this isn t easy  okay 
yeah 
driving my ass here in the
pouring rain wasn t easy either 
my cousin is
gordon northcott 
he owns the ranch
where you found me 
he said i could live there in exchange
i watch the place when he s gone 
doing chores
and stuff like that 
said i could stay as
long as i wanted to 
i thought that meant i could
leave whenever i wanted 
mmm 
you saying that he
held you prisoner 
bull 
when i got there  you were
running around free as a jaybird 
could ve left any
time you wanted 
no 
so  what s this  huh 
some kind of story to cover why
you re in the country illegally 
no  it s nothing like that 
 cause i don t have
time for this  okay 
listen to me 
he said   
what 
what did he say 
he said that if i tried
to leave  he d kill me 
look  you don t understand
what he s like 
what he    what we did 
what he made me do 
all right 
let s start at
the beginning then 
what d he make you do 
we killed some kids 
what 
look  i didn t mean to  i swear 
he made me help him 
he said if i didn t 
he d kill me  too 
look  you gotta help me 
please  i m so scared 
i don t want to go
to hell for killing kids 
look 
what kids  what    what
are you talking about 
i don t know 
i never knew their names 
names 
how many 
how many kids 
all together 
about 20  i guess 
no  you re lying 
no  it s true  i swear 
you re gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids 
yeah  thereabouts 
i stopped counting
after a while 
gordon said maybe one
or two may have escaped 
but   
no 
nobody can just up
and kill 20 kids  okay 
we did 
we did 
how 
most times we d just
have one or two 
sometimes as many as three 
i always knew when we
were getting ready to leave 
clean up the car 
make sure the tires
were good 
check the engine 
 cause he was afraid that
the car would break down
and we d get caught 
my loving baby
we d always go a different
direction every time 
never hit the same
part of town twice 
sometimes we d just
drive around for hours 
till we found somebody 
well  there you are 
we ve been looking
for you like mad 
you have 
sure thing 
listen  your folks 
they ve been in an accident 
and they sent us to come find
you  now  they re hurt real bad 
the police took them to the hospital  but
they didn t have time to come find you 
so we said that
we would do it 
now  come on 
all right 
get in here  hurry 
listen  we gotta get you to that
hospital so you can see your folks 
see  a lot of kids won t
get in a car alone with a stranger 
but when he s got
a kid there   
there s a good boy 
scoot over 
scoot over  san 
    that made it easier 
i want you to hold on tight 
they d look
at me and say   
we ve got a long way to go 
 hey  if he s safe    
and we are gonna fly 
    i guess
i will be  too   
every time they got
in the truck 
i just wanted to die 
as soon as we got back to the
ranch  they went in the coop 
you boys hungry 
huh 
watch the door  sanford 
hey  watch the door 
what s the matter 
i m not gonna hurt you 
are you worried that
i m gonna hurt you 
i m not gonna hurt you 
huh  come here 
no  no  no  no  please 
  i would never hurt you 
some days
he d do them right off 
other days he d wait 
pick up a few more 
until he had about
four or five of them 
yeah 
no  no  no 
  no what 
no what  huh 
come on  come on  come on 
sanford  keep your
eye on that door 
no  please  no  no  no 
no  no  no  no 
please  no  no 
he d    he d
sometimes leave
just one or two of them
alive  barely  anyway 
he d say 
 finish them  san 
 finish them or    finish
them or i ll finish you  
and i did 
and i killed them 
and i did 
i killed them 
oh  god  i killed them 
oh  god  oh 
hey 
hey

think you might be able to recognize them 
i don t know

room 18 
i want to talk to somebody

please 
who is in charge here

i m the head doctor on duty

see to it 
christ 
long as it s not the original 
no  it s not 
here it is 
and who is that  is
that baker s file or larson 
that s baker 
he said he wanted   
nurse  i wanna see
every piece of paper you have on
the case of mrs  christine collins 
and i want to see it right
now  do you understand me 
every piece  when
will she be coming out 
oh  it s just up ahead 
oh  all right 
let s   
hurricane hits
west palm beach 
babe ruth hits
53rd home run 
kids found murdered in riverside 
  there it is 
biggest crime
in los angeles history 
collins boy assumed dead 
read it here 
read it here 
mrs  collins 
i m so sorry 
captain  your handling of
the christine collins case
has exposed this department
to public ridicule 
there is even the possibility
of civil and criminal liability 
sir  nobody could ve known what
was happening up at that ranch 
not us  the sheriff s department 
or the marshal s office 
and as for the
collins woman 
i m still not convinced that her boy
is among the victims up in wineville 
no 
no 
there were four other photos of
missing boys that looked a lot like him 
the clark kid
could ve been mistaken 
maybe he was 
which begs the obvious
question  who cares 
sir 
the mayor wants
this to go away 
i want this to go away 
the way you do that is to stop
insisting that walter collins
is not among those boys killed
up at that goddamn ranch 
because if the boy you brought
back is not walter collins 
and he s not dead up at that
ranch  then where the hell is he 
people are gonna want to
know why we haven t found him 
why we re not
doing our job 
but if  on the other hand 
he is  or could be  among those
poor boys killed up in wineville 
then the inquiries stop 
it s a momentary
embarrassment
you re just gonna
have to live with 
better a short
inconvenience
than a lingering problem 
wouldn t you say  captain 
yes  sir 
the boy s been gone
nearly a year 
if he was going to be found 
it would ve happened by now 
whether he was up
at that ranch or not 
the truth is he probably
is dead somewhere 
better his mother accept that
now than later  don t you think 
yes  sir 
  good 
that ll be all  captain 
that s how you want it 
then i guess we re done here 
tell county jail we re
remanding him for trial 
wait  i didn t do anything  i
wasn t even here when it happened 
by pretending to
be walter collins 
you re interfering in a police
investigation of a kidnapping and murder 
we can try you as accomplice
to that murder after the fact 
that s too bad 
county jail is a lot worse than
a juvenile hall or a foster home 
it s a lot worse 
you can t do that 
i m just a kid 
sanford clark s a kid  too 
fifteen 
he s going to jail 
all murderers and their accomplices
go to jail  everybody knows that 
get him out of here 
it s out of my hands now 
wait  i don t
want to go to jail 
prove it 
i   
i knew los angeles is where
they make the tom mix movies 
i figured
if i could meet tom mix
maybe he would let me
ride on his horse 
his horse is named tony 
did you know that 
how are you feeling 
all right 
the police still
have a car outside 
i guess they re waiting to see
what your next move is going to be 
i m going home 
  and then 
then  i ve been giving it
a lot of thought 
and what they did to those women 
and what they did about walter 
i used to always tell him   you never
start a fight  but you always finish it  
and i didn t start this
fight  but i m gonna finish it 
mrs  collins  right now you re a
sufficiently high profile that i think
even the police would hesitate
to go after you out in the open 
but i have to warn you that
could change very quickly
if they feel their
position threatened 
very quickly indeed 
what are they gonna
do to me now 
they got nothing 
i m going home 
hi  sis 
gordon 
i didn t know
you were back in town 
yeah  i got in
a couple of days ago 
figured i d surprise you 
is that    is that okay 
yes  yes  of course 
of course  come on in 
where s that
little niece of mine 
she went into town 
should be back this evening 
uh  bob s here 
oh  good 
uh  i was gonna ask if i
could stay on a couple days 
staying 
yeah 
listen  can i use
your bathroom 
it s been a long ride and
i could really use a shower 
of course 
  okay 
thank you 
is that   
all right  go next door 
i ll call the police  hurry 
operator 
how may i connect you 
he s upstairs  sir 
go around the other side 
cut him off 
come with me 
  yes  sir 
let s go 
mrs  collins  i d like you
to meet my friend  mr  hahn 
mrs  collins  my deepest
condolences on your loss 
may we come in 
i appreciate the sentiment 
but they ve yet to find   
to identify the
remains as my son 
i m afraid it never
gets any easier 
i lost a daughter
to polio five years ago 
there s not a day goes by
when i don t think 
 i should mention
this to claudine  
then i remember
she s not here 
please  sit 
i ve been on the phone
all morning
with the appointment secretary
of the police commission 
they said that they
won t let me testify
at the hearing or call witnesses 
that it won t be necessary 
i know  my sources say
the police commission
is going to say that jones and the
lapd did absolutely nothing wrong 
and that the real blame lies
with the kid and with you
for being difficult and forcing them
to put you away for your own safety 
then i guess i would have to
hire a lawyer  file a civil suit 
i went to the best
attorney in town 
a man who s sued this
city four times and won 
unfortunately  we can t
afford to really hire him 
i see 
which is why
i m doing this pro bono 
it would be my honor to defend
your honor  mrs  collins 
in my 15 years as a lawyer 
i have never seen anyone fight
as long or as hard as you have 
in what is so clearly
in the cause of justice 
thank you 
let me see
what s on the shelf 
i ll look 
yes  may i   
my name is s s  hahn 
and i have a court order for the immediate
release of all women being detained
in this institution under
the designation code 12
pending a formal inquiry into
the reasons for their detainment 
i m sorry  the doctor
in charge is not here
until the morning 
  madam  let me be clearer 
either you will produce the
people named in that court order 
or you will find yourself behind
bars  and i mean without a key 
i can t authorize you   
  madam  stand aside 
can i see her now 
sure  absolutely 
  how does she look 
all right  fellas 
step back  let s give him room 
here he is 
mr  northcott 
any comment on your arrest 
mr  northcott 
how are you feeling 
oh  i m feeling fine 
i ve been on a little
vacation  as some of you know 
it was
a really pleasant vacation 
the police have certainly provided
me with a lot of amusement 
how long
you been in hiding 
how did you
avoid capture 
easy  easy 
that s far enough 
well  i didn t  did i 
one more shot 
have you seen
your picture in the paper 
didn t know anybody
wanted me until just recently 
didn t even try 
my luggage still has
my initials on it  fellas 
did you know why
the police were after you 
no  but i figured it d be a good
idea if i were to just stay out of it 
any remorse  sir 
do you have anything to say to
the parents of the children you murdered 
no comment 
one more shot 
this way 
mayor cryer 
this is unexpected 
so was this 
subpoenas  requests for
depositions  interrogatories 
all courtesy of mr  hahn and his
new client  christine collins 
you don t have to look them
over too closely  chief 
your own copies should
be coming any time now 
the city council has also
agreed to look into this 
starting immediately 
god damn it 
i thought this was
supposed to go away 
this is an election year 
i can t afford
this kind of press 
it is going away  sir  i ve instructed
captain jones to deal with it 
i m afraid 
falling on his sword
and saying he made a mistake isn t
going to be good enough  chief 
if we take him out of
the picture for a while 
just might help calm things down
until the hearing s finished 
what is happening 
  didn t you hear 
it s the biggest protest
i ve ever seen 
protest 
  yeah 
over the collins broad 
if you can believe that 
we want
justice  we want justice 
oh  my 
mr  harris 
the lord works in mysterious
ways  mrs  collins 
boy  does he ever 
ladies and gentlemen  can
i have your attention  please 
there are more people gathered in this chamber
than have ever been in this room before 
therefore  i ask you to refrain
from demonstrations of any kind 
tell the truth  tell the truth 
we are all here because we want to
know the real facts in this case 
and everybody is going to be heard
if we have to sit here for a week 
mr  thorpe  i don t see any
members of the police commission 
are there any members of
the police department in the room 
is chief davis here 
is captain jones here 
is there anybody here
representing the police 
mrs  collins  could you come across
the street with me for just a moment 
there s something
i think you should see 
well  i hate to call a
recess before we ve even started 
but i think a few
phone calls are in order 
the police decided it d be best
to keep this off the main docket
in order to avoid exactly the sort
of chaos we have across the street 
mrs  collins 
i m leanne clay 
this is my husband  john 
  hi 
i just wanted to pass
along my sympathies 
what we went through
waiting to hear anything
about our son david
was bad enough  now this 
but what the police did to
you  there was no call for that 
no call at all 
all rise 
please  be seated 
  bailiff 
oh  hey 
i saw you in the papers 
you got a lot of moxie  standing
up to the police like that 
the defendant
will please rise 
gordon stewart northcott 
you ve been charged with three
counts of murder in the first degree 
with an additional 17 counts under
review by the district attorney s office 
how do you plea 
oh  not guilty  your honor 
you may sit  mr  northcott 
in light of the defendant s penchant for
international travel  no bail will be set 
this court will hear preliminary
motions by tomorrow morning 
the boy  walter collins 
was reported as missing 
march 10  1928 
we then instituted
a nationwide search 
on august 18th  we received
a cable indicating that a boy
matching his description was
found in dekalb  illinois 
upon questioning  he admitted
to being walter collins 
we then made arrangements for him
to be transported back to california 
where mrs  collins told you
the boy was not her son 
yes  she denied
his identity
in spite of all of the evidence
pointing to the contrary 
but  as subsequent
events have demonstrated 
she was correct 
so  what prompted
you to send her
for psychological
evaluation 
whether or not this was
in fact the correct boy
was not relevant
to my decision 
throughout this period 
she acted strangely 
she was often cool
and aloof and unemotional 
especially when confronted
with the boy we found in dekalb
and in our
subsequent conversation 
it was because of her
disturbing behavior that i
submitted her for observation
to the psychopathic ward of los
angeles county general hospital 
just like that 
you snap your fingers
and an innocent woman
is thrown
into the psycho ward 
she wasn t thrown  every family
in this state is in grave danger
when a police captain can
take a woman into his office
and five minutes later
have her thrown into the psychopathic
ward on his own authority 
she wasn t thrown 
she wasn t thrown 
she wasn t thrown 
what was that  captain 
she wasn t thrown 
she was escorted 
escorted  thrown  the verb
doesn t matter  captain 
what does matter is that her incarceration
was ordered without a warrant 
i am holding a carbon copy
of the affidavit of insanity
that was issued in the case
of the state of california
v  christine collins 
who signed the affidavit 
i did 
well  now  let me see
if i have this correct 
a woman was thrown into the
psychopathic ward without a warrant 
because no warrant existed 
and when it was finally
written several days later 
there was no need to sign it
or to go to a judge
because she was already
in the asylum 
is this correct  captain 
technically  yes 
extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing   
we were dealing with
an extraordinary situation 
now  is it our fault
that we were being deceived
by a boy who claimed to
be walter collins  no 
in light of his claims
and her disturbing behavior 
who wouldn t begin to think that there
was something the matter with her 
because she questioned you 
no  because
she wouldn t listen 
because she insisted
on being obstinate 
because she tried to take
matters into her own hand 
best left to
qualified officers 
because once
civil disobedience starts   
because she was fighting
for the life of her son 
a boy who may have
still been alive
while you were wasting valuable time
denying you had done anything wrong 
and in the end
that s what
happened  isn t it 
at some point  while
all this was going on 
walter collins
was brutally murdered 
along with as many
as 19 other boys
at the northcott ranch
in wineville 
is that correct  captain 
yes  it is 
it s a travesty 
no further questions 
train number 14 
now boarding on track   
so  after much effort  we
were able to identify this boy 
who s been responsible
for so much trouble lately 
as arthur hutchins
of cedar rapids  iowa 
between this  and the arrest of
the man suspected of murdering
the real walter collins 
we ve cleared up two of the biggest
mysteries in the history of los angeles 
i hope you gentlemen
of the press will give
as much space to the
good things we do
as the mistakes that are
made on rare occasions 
gentlemen  allow me
to introduce you
to the boy s real mother 
mrs  janet hutchins 
arthur 
i hope he wasn t too
much trouble for you 
oh  no  not at all 
how about
a photograph  fellas 
one more 
mrs  hutchins 
mrs  collins  the woman he was
staying with  wanted him to have these 
they re the clothes
she let him wear 
well  thank you 
isn t that nice  arthur 
tell the nice officer 
 thank you  
i don t want them 
give them to somebody else 
precocious
little fellow  isn t he 
it s not my fault 
it s the police 
they said i was walter collins 
not me  it wasn t my idea 
not my idea 
  get   
yeah  go blame the police
for your own mistakes 
we ve seen a lot of
that lately  haven t we 
take care now  arthur 
safe travels 
all right  fellas 
that s it for today 
sir  sir  what
did the boy mean by that 
it was march 10th  and
i came home from work 
and my nine year old
son  walter  was gone 
captain jones was acting on
information he believed to be correct 
walter collins had a diastema 
also known as a diastema 
that child was never
in my classroom 
i can certainly
attest to that 
we rely on our good
friends in the police department
to point to us those
people who exhibit behavior
which is socially
unacceptable 
about four inches
shorter than the last mark of walter 
well  some of
these pictures show
what sanford clark
told me 
that he did in fact help in
the murder of these children 
thank you  detective 
gentlemen of the jury 
i ask you to take a good
look at these images 
they establish beyond
any reasonable doubt
the circumstances and the
nature of these heinous crimes 
i m in here 
reverend 
when walter was here  i
used to walk by his room
when he was sleeping 
and even though i couldn t
see him or hear him 
i could feel him 
that s why i don t
think walter s dead 
i can still feel him 
mrs  collins   
  no 
i know what
the police said 
but that place
and the remains 
they couldn t be
properly identified 
and maybe that kid made a mistake
when he picked walter s picture 
i understand you don t
want to accept this 
what mother would 
but i think it s time
for you to move on
and start over
for yourself 
your son would
want you to move on 
maybe 
maybe he d want me
to keep looking for him 
maybe he s somewhere
waiting for me 
i believe he is
waiting  ma am 
he s waiting in
that place where
we ll all go someday to be
reunited with our loved ones 
and on that day  he ll know
from front to back  end to end 
heart to soul  that you did
everything you could  mrs  collins 
everything 
we should go  ma am 
one minute 
this meeting will
now come to order 
this committee has now
heard all of the testimony 
and  in light of
the facts presented 
we recommend that the
suspension of captain jones
be made permanent 
order  please  please 
mr  foreman 
has the jury
reached a verdict 
we have  your honor 
will the defendant
please rise 
second  that steps be taken
to investigate a change
in the prevailing laws and
procedures by which a citizen
of this city can be
subjected to incarceration
in the county s
mental facilities 
you may read the verdict 
 we the jury find the defendant 
gordon stewart northcott 
 guilty on all counts of
murder in the first degree  
finally  restoration of public
confidence in the police department
can only be achieved
by the removal of
its chief of police 
and this committee
so recommends 
this hearing
is concluded 
does the defendant wish to make a
statement before judgment is passed 
i want to make
it real clear
that i never once got
a fair shake from you 
your honor 
or from this court 
the only one in here worth
a good goddamn is her 
 cause she s the only one who
never badmouthed me to the press 
she s the only one
who understands
what it is to be
framed by the police
for something you didn t
do  all right  that s enough 
and then to just be
thrown in the hole 
to just rot and to fester
and to be forgotten
and fade away  isn t that right 
  gordon 
counsel 
  isn t it 
i never killed your boy 
mrs  collins 
counsel  that s enough 
  i would never do that 
i would never
hurt walter 
counsel  get control
of your client
or i ll have him
bound and gagged 
he s an angel 
come on  gordon 
  get off of me 
now get down 
gordon stewart northcott 
it is the judgment
of this court
that you be conveyed
to san quentin prison 
where you ll be held in solitary
confinement for a period of two years 
until october 2  1930 
on that date  you will be
hanged by the neck until dead 
may god have
mercy on your soul 
is it all right if i
have a 10 minute break 
of course 
you know 
one of these days you might
actually consider taking
one of these
10 minute breaks 
it might be
good for you 
we ll see 
this is
christine collins 
i called yesterday 
i was wondering if you had a
chance to look through the files
and see if there was a match
to my son  walter collins 
i see 
well  if it s all
right with you 
i ll call back in a
month  thank you very much 
mrs  collins 
  i was just   
yes  i know 
in fact  that s why
i wanted to see you 
it s about walter 
we had a   
well  we received
a very strange telegram 
from who 
gordon northcott 
he s asked to see you 
why 
he said he knows you re
still looking for your son 
and before he dies   
he says he lied when he testified
that he didn t kill walter 
christine  he s willing to
finally admit that he did it 
he says if you come up
to see him in person 
then he ll tell you
the truth  to your face
so that you can get
on with your life
and have some peace 
as you know  he s
set to be executed
the day after tomorrow
at san quentin 
so you don t have
a lot of time 
it took me most of the morning
to make all the arrangements 
turns out  you re the
first woman in 30 years
the state has allowed
to visit a serial killer
on the eve of
his execution 
you ll be all
right  ma am 
yes 
  we re right at the door 
twenty minutes 
don t suppose you
got a cigarette 
mr  northcott  you
asked me to come here 
you said that
if i did 
you would tell me
the truth about my son 
yeah 
you re right 
i did say that 
but see  the thing is 
i didn t really think
that you would come 
and now 
and now   
and now what 
i just didn t
expect that you d   
i don t wanna see you 
you don t wanna see me 
no  see  i can t do this 
i don t wanna talk to you  i
can t talk to you right now 
not with what they re gonna
be doing to me tomorrow 
it s one thing  mrs 
collins  to send a telegram 
that is really easy 
but when it s here  right
now  in person  you know 
i just  i can t   
i can t tell you what you
want to hear  mrs  collins 
and why not 
because i don t want to go
to hell with a lie on my lips 
see  i did my penance 
and i asked god to forgive me
and he did  so far as i know 
and i have been
really good ever since 
but if i lie now  if i
commit any sins right now

god  hey  hey  hey 
you get back here 
hey  hold it  hey 
hey

stop  damn it 
boys 
i m coming after you 
damn it  damn it 
boys  i ll find you no
matter where you are 
they re not in there 
  come on  get in the car 
i m gonna find you  damn
it  damn it  come on 
shit  get in
the car  sanford 
that was the last
i saw of any of them 
so  you don t know if either
of the other two were captured 
no 
all i know is 
if walter hadn t
come back for me
i don t think i ever would ve
gotten out of there 
okay 
so  what happened
after that 
i kept off
the main roads 
until i saw a train stopped
at a crossing and i jumped in 
why didn t you tell
anyone what had happened 
i was afraid 
i thought they d come
after me  or my folks 
so  i just didn t
tell anybody 
i was on my own until i got a free
meal from this lady  miss lansing 
told her i was an
orphan  on my own 
she said i could stay on 
and i did 
every night 
i d wake up thinking they
were right outside my window 
and then i heard the
police talking on the radio
about what happened
at the ranch 
and i thought   for sure
i can t go back now  
why 
why not 
since i didn t tell
anybody what happened 
i was afraid they d blame
me for those kids being dead 
so i just stayed away 
what made you come forward
now  after all this time 
hmm  why come
forward now 
i really miss my mom 
i really miss my dad 
i just wanna go home 
i just wanna go home 
are you all right 
i love you 
i still can t believe it 
five years  case closed  everyone
thinks he s dead  and there he is 
wouldn t be  if it
wasn t for walter 
your son did a brave
thing  mrs  collins 
you should be
very proud of him 
i am 
you still think
he s out there 
why not 
three boys made a run for
it that night  detective 
and if one got out 
then maybe either or both
of the others did  too 
maybe walter s out there  having
the same fears that he did 
afraid to come home
and identify himself 
or afraid he ll get
into trouble 
but either way
