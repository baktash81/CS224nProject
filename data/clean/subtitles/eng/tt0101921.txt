to put romance back
into your relationship

you get the sweats and your
hearts starts a poundin  
  how did you know 
  simple  honey

i used to burst
into tears for no reason at all 
you need some hormones  hmm

with your
pretty complexion   
i ll bet you ll be
great with cosmetics 
i know how
you feel 
i was about your age
when i had my child 
then i went through
the change of life 
i didn t know you had
a child  yes  i did 
albert 
when he was born  the doctor said
it would be best if i didn t see him 
he said his mind would never
develop past the age of five 
and i should just put him
in an institution   
because the burden of raisin  a
child like that would be too great 
well  i thought
about ruth 
she always said   
there was a separate
god for children 
so i smiled at him and
i asked for the baby 
oh  how could anybody think
that sweet  precious baby   
could ever
be a burden 
why  from the minute he was born 
albert was the joy of my life 
the lord s
greatest gift 
i don t believe there was a purer
soul ever lived on this earth 
i had him with me
till he was 30 
then he went to sleep
and didn t wake up 
sometimes i can t wait to get
to heaven to see him again 
whoo 
shit 
it s a boy 
i think a prayer of
thanksgivin  would be in order 
goddamn it to hell  son of a bitch 
she did it  here s to ruth 
idgie always did have a
way with words around the reverend 
well  ruth had a baby 
she named him buddy   
buddy junior

havin  the same reaction
after frank would beat me 
thankin  the lord for givin  me
the strength to take it 
and i remembered   
thankin  the lord
for each day my mother lived 
even when she was
spittin  up blood   
and prayin  for me
to kill her 
i looked in my mother s eyes
pleadin for me to help her   
and all i could do
was pray 
while you were gone 
as i was holdin  buddy 
i thought if that bastard 
frank bennett   
ever tries
to take my child 
i won t pray 
i ll break his neck 
ruth  you don t have to worry
about frank bennett anymore

what brings you to these
parts  smell of good cookin  
hey  smokey 
sipsey  let me fix you some lunch 
you know just about everybody
except curtis smoote 
he s the officer from
over at valdosta  georgia 
he s been lookin  for the same man for
almost 5 years  very stubborn fella 
he loves our barbecue 
mommy  mommy 
buddy 
everybody
outta the way 
give him here 
let him go  i ve got him 
come on  you re
gonna be all right 
open the door 
put him in the
car  it s all right  honey 
i can understand   
having a funeral
for an arm 
i just don t know why she
insists on callin  him  stump  
she say everybody
else gonna be callin him that   
so we might just as well
be the first 
okay  ice cream
and cake for everybody 
go on 
my daddy always used to say there
was a separate god for children 
the good lord was
watchin  over stump that day 
but then it started to rain
that month 
it rained and rained  and it
flooded parts of whistle stop 
that s why grady s deputies stumbled
onto frank bennett s pickup truck 
and i just knew idgie d
never get out of this mess 
now  you in or out  remember 
i didn t take any cards 
look at me and
let me see your face 
idgie  i have to talk
to you  you re bluffin  
why don t you sit in  i ll deal
you a new hand  gladys won t mind 
in private  idgie 
excuse us  ruth 
a ha  i m just tryin  to teach
you not to fall for any tricks 
you re doin 
a great job 
what s your hurry 
and what is
so important 
what s that 
somebody found frank
bennett s truck in the river 
what s that got
to do with me 
officially  you and big george
are under arrest for murder 
you re in my custody
until tomorrow 
i m supposed to take you to
georgia first thing in the morning 
unless  of course   
well  some people have
been known to pack up   
and sneak out of town
in the middle of the night 
what about big george 
well  the way
i figure it 
they d be satisfied
if they had him 
idgie 
this is serious 
we re talkin 
murder of a white man 
someone s
gonna have to pay 
nobody wants
to hang a woman 
no deal 
idgie  i know how you feel
about big george 
hell  we all do 
but these just
the facts of life 
i can t do that 
take me to jail
if you have to 
well  that s what
i thought you d say   
 cause you re absolutely 
unconditionally 
positively the most stubborn
person i ve known in my life 
idgie and big george went
to the county jail in valdosta   
to await trial for
the murder of frank bennett 
they didn t have
to wait too long 
did you know frank bennett  no  sir 
you mean  you
never met the man   
whose wife  ruth  is your
business partner  that s right 
you never threatened to kill
frank bennett at his home   
in front of his hired man
in june of 1932 
the same frank bennett you did not
know  oh  that was me  all right 
i thought you wanted to know if we d
ever met    and the answer is no 
um  i threatened
to kill him 
but we were never  what you
might say  properly introduced 
is it not true that in september
of 1932 you came to valdosta   
and took frank bennett s wife and
child back to alabama with you 
um    just the wife 
the child came later 
how much later  the usual  nine months 
i suggest that you bribed   
this poor  weak woman with
promises of liquor and money 
and she lost control
of her senses momentarily 
when her husband came back
to get her and take her home 
you and your colored man
murdered him in cold blood 
no  sir 
well  where were you on the
night of september 30  1933 
i was at the town hall
doing a show 
and after that  i was
at my mother s house 
oh  yeah 
who was with you 
just big george and myself  what about
your mother  can she confirm that 
no  sir 
she died a year ago 
i m sorry to hear that 
but do you expect 12 intelligent
men to believe you 
although one witness is dead and
the other is a colored man 
known to be a worthless 
no good  lying nigger 
you expect these men
to take your word for it   
just because
you say so 
that s right  you gump faced 
blown up  baboon assed bastard 
one more outburst like that   
and i ll hold you in contempt
of court  you understand 
yes  sir 
oh  lord 
next witness 
did you know
that you were pregnant   
at the time
you left valdosta 
yes 
and yet  you tell us
over and over   
that you went with this
woman    willingly 
yes  i wouldn t raise
my child with frank bennett 
but why 
did this woman promise you money  no 
a bigger home 
no  no 
then tell us 
mrs  bennett 
why would a respectable
christian woman   
go anywhere with this idgie
threadgoode    i object 
whose reputation
is known far and wide   
as a notorious liar
and drunkard 
  objection 
  sustained 
why did you leave   
with idgie threadgoode
that day 
answer the
question  mrs  bennett 
because she   
she s the best friend
i ever had 
and i love her 
thank you  mrs 
bennett  that will be all 
the defense
calls as its last witness   
the rev 
herbert scroggins 
place your right hand
on the bible  please 
i brought my own 
if you don t mind 
you swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth 
i do 
you have
information about the whereabouts   
of idgie threadgoode and her
colored man  known as big george 
on the night
of september 30  1933 
yes  sir 
i do 
it has been
suggested here   
that she and her colored man
were at her mother s house 
can you confirm that 
no  sir  that is a lie 
oh  shit 
it has been my
habit to write all the dates   
of the activities of
the church in my bible 
i show that the night
of september 30  1933   
was the start of our
annual revival   
down at the
baptist campground 
sister threadgoode
was there   
along with her hired man 
george pullman 
who was in charge of the
barbecue as he has been   
for the last ten years 
objection 
that doesn t mean anything  murder could ve
taken place any time the next couple of days 
have you ever been to one of
our revivals  sir  well  no 
do you attend church
regularly  sir 
 course i do 
good  well  maybe if you
attended one of our revivals 
you d know
they last three days   
and three nights 
your honor 
approach the bench 
percy  it don t look like
you got a case at all 
in the first place 
there s no body 
second  we got us a preacher
nobody s gonna dispute 
but  your honor    i m tellin  you 
what you got is a lot of nothing 
i say frank
bennett got himself drunk 
drove into the river and
was long ago eaten up   
and i don t give
a good goddamn 
what we got here is a
case of accidental death 
case dismissed 
whoo 
see you in church 
sister 
reverend 
i can t believe he
actually swore on a bible 
well  not really 
if that judge
had looked closer 
he d have seen it was really
a copy of moby dick 
but why did he do it  for the sheer
joy of seeing you in church again   
which i suggested to him
might be your penance 
you didn t promise him 
did you  yes  ma am  i did 
and i never
break my word 
if i live 1 000 years 
i will never forgive you 
i don t know what s worse 
church or jail 
there now 
don t you look pretty 
oh  yes  honey 
you ll have me lookin  like
ginger rogers before you re done 
don t let mr  dunaway see me 
he s liable to go wild 
i m glad to see
you re in a good mood 
you ve slimmed down quite a bit
in the last few weeks 
i m just so happy big george
and idgie got off 
i would have killed frank
bennett if i could ve 
did anybody really
think she did it 
some said yes 
some said no 
 course the only one who really
knew was frank bennett 
and you know what they say 
dead men tell no tales

my mama

than fry chicken that night 
did idgie really barbecue frank
bennett  are you pullin  my leg 
secret s in the sauce 
or so i ve been told 
now you know why
idgie had to go on trial 
she knew the law would never
believe sipsey  no 
sipsey or big george
or anyone else of color   
would ve been hangin 
from the nearest tree 
to this day 
i m still not sure   
whether ruth
ever believed   
that idgie didn t kill
frank bennett 
truth s a funny thing
sometimes 
i feel better now 
good 
i feel better  cause
all these people ll live

important thing in life is

think it is  no  ma am 
friends 
best friends

idgie 
idgie s alive 
oh  yes 
she s still out and about
charmin  bees and selling honey 
sometimes i think
i catch a glimpse of her 
maybe we ll
see her today 
maybe 
let s go 
after ruth died and
the railroad stopped runnin  
the cafe shut down  and everybody
just scattered to the winds 
it was never more than just
a little knockabout place 
but now that
i look back on it 
when that cafe closed   
the heart of the town
just stopped beating 
it s funny how
a little place like this   
brought so
many people together 
i ll remember you
when i ve forgotten
all the rest
you to me
were true
you to me
were the best
when there is no more
you cut to the core
quicker than anyone
that i knew
now when the
roses fade
i m in the shade
baby
i ll remember you
now listen
didn t i
didn t i love you
didn t i
didn t i care
didn t i sleep
and didn t i weep beside you
with the rain that
was blowing in your hair
oh oh oh oh oh
i ll remember you
when the wind blows
on through
the piney wood
it was you who came
right through for me  baby
it was you
who understood
though i d never say
that i turned the way
that you
have led me to
darling  in the end
my dear sweet friend
i ll remember you
yes  i will now
i ll remember you
yes  i will now
i ll remember  remember

the world from each other
