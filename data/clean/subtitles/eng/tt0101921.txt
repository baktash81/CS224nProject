the change of life
i didnt know you had
a child yes i did
albert
when he was born the doctor said
it would be best if i didnt see him
he said his mind would never
develop past the age of five
and i should just put him
in an institution
because the burden of raisin a
child like that would be too great
well i thought
about ruth
she always said
there was a separate
god for children
so i smiled at him and
i asked for the baby
oh how could anybody think
that sweet precious baby
could ever
be a burden
why from the minute he was born
albert was the joy of my life
the lords
greatest gift
i dont believe there was a purer
soul ever lived on this earth
i had him with me
till he was 30
then he went to sleep
and didnt wake up
sometimes i cant wait to get
to heaven to see him again
whoo
shit
its a boy
i think a prayer of
thanksgivin would be in order
goddamn it to hell sonofabitch

way with words around the reverend

spittin up blood
and prayin for me
to kill her
i looked in my mothers eyes
pleadinfor me to help her

way of working things out

what brings you to these
parts smell of good cookin
hey smokey
sipsey let me fix you some lunch
you know just about everybody
except curtis smoote

over at valdosta georgia
hes been lookin for the same man for
almost 5 years very stubborn fella
he loves our barbecue
mommy mommy
buddy
everybody
outta the way
give him here
let him go ive got him
come on youre
gonna be all right
open the door
put him in the
car its all right honey
i can understand
having a funeral
for an arm
i just dont know why she
insists on callin him stump
she say everybody
else gonna be callinhim that
so we might just as well
be the first
okay ice cream
and cake for everybody
go on
my daddy always used to say there
was a separate god for children
the good lord was
watchin over stump that day
but then it started to rain
that month
it rained and rained and it
flooded parts of whistle stop
thats why gradys deputies stumbled
onto frank bennetts pickup truck
and i just knew idgied
never get out of this mess
now you in or out remember
i didnt take any cards
look at me and
let me see your face
idgie i have to talk
to you youre bluffin
why dont you sit in ill deal
you a new hand gladys wont mind
in private idgie
excuse us ruth
aha im just tryin to teach
you not to fall for any tricks
youre doin
a great job
whats your hurry
and what is
so important
whats that
somebody found frank
bennetts truck in the river
whats that got
to do with me
officially you and big george
are under arrest for murder
youre in my custody
until tomorrow
im supposed to take you to
georgia first thing in the morning
unless of course
well some people have
been known to pack up
and sneak out of town
in the middle of the night
what about big george
well the way
i figure it
theyd be satisfied
if they had him
idgie
this is serious
were talkin
murder of a white man
someones
gonna have to pay
nobody wants
to hang a woman
no deal
idgie i know how you feel
about big george
hell we all do
but these just
the facts of life
i cant do that
take me to jail
if you have to
well thats what
i thought youd say
cause youre absolutely
unconditionally
positively the most stubborn
person ive known in my life
idgie and big george went
to the county jail in valdosta
to await trial for
the murder of frank bennett
they didnt have
to wait too long
did you know frank bennett no sir
you mean you
never met the man
whose wife ruth is your
business partner thats right
you never threatened to kill
frank bennett at his home
in front of his hired man
in june of 1932
the same frank bennett you did not
know oh that was me all right
i thought you wanted to know if wed
ever met and the answer is no
um i threatened
to kill him
but we were never what you
might say properly introduced
is it not true that in september
of 1932 you came to valdosta
and took frank bennetts wife and
child back to alabama with you
um just the wife
the child came later
how much later the usual nine months
i suggest that you bribed
this poor weak woman with
promises of liquor and money
and she lost control
of her senses momentarily
when her husband came back
to get her and take her home
you and your colored man
murdered him in cold blood
no sir
well where were you on the
night of september 30 1933
i was at the town hall
doing a show
and after that i was
at my mothers house
oh yeah
who was with you
just big george and myself what about
your mother can she confirm that
no sir
she died a year ago
im sorry to hear that
but do you expect 12 intelligent
men to believe you
although one witness is dead and
the other is a colored man
known to be a worthless
nogood lying nigger
you expect these men
to take your word for it
just because
you say so
thats right you gumpfaced
blownup baboonassed bastard
one more outburst like that
and ill hold you in contempt
of court you understand
yes sir
oh lord
next witness
did you know
that you were pregnant
at the time
you left valdosta
yes
and yet you tell us
over and over
that you went with this
woman willingly
yes i wouldnt raise
my child with frank bennett
but why
did this woman promise you money no
a bigger home
no no
then tell us
mrs bennett
why would a respectable
christian woman
go anywhere with this idgie
threadgoode i object
whose reputation
is known far and wide
as a notorious liar
and drunkard
objection
sustained
why did you leave
with idgie threadgoode
that day
answer the
question mrs bennett
because she
shes the best friend
i ever had
and i love her
thank you mrs
bennett that will be all
the defense
calls as its last witness
the rev
herbert scroggins
place your right hand
on the bible please
i brought my own
if you dont mind
you swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth
i do
you have
information about the whereabouts
of idgie threadgoode and her
colored man known as big george
on the night
of september 30 1933
yes sir
i do
it has been
suggested here
that she and her colored man
were at her mothers house
can you confirm that
no sir that is a lie
oh shit
it has been my
habit to write all the dates
of the activities of
the church in my bible
i show that the night
of september 30 1933
was the start of our
annual revival
down at the
baptist campground
sister threadgoode
was there
along with her hired man
george pullman
who was in charge of the
barbecue as he has been
for the last ten years
objection
that doesnt mean anything murder couldve
taken place any time the next couple of days
have you ever been to one of
our revivals sir well no
do you attend church
regularly sir
course i do
good well maybe if you
attended one of our revivals
youd know
they last three days
and three nights
your honor
approach the bench
percy it dont look like
you got a case at all
in the first place
theres no body
second we got us a preacher
nobodys gonna dispute
but your honor im tellin you
what you got is a lot of nothing
i say frank
bennett got himself drunk
drove into the river and
was long ago eaten up
and i dont give
a good goddamn
what we got here is a
case of accidental death
case dismissed
whoo
see you in church
sister
reverend
i cant believe he
actually swore on a bible
well not really
if that judge
had looked closer
hed have seen it was really
a copy of moby dick
but why did he do it for the sheer
joy of seeing you in church again
which i suggested to him
might be your penance
you didnt promise him
did you yes maam i did
and i never
break my word
if i live 1000 years
i will never forgive you
i dont know whats worse
church or jail
there now
dont you look pretty
oh yes honey
youll have me lookin like
ginger rogers before youre done
dont let mr dunaway see me
hes liable to go wild
im glad to see
youre in a good mood
youve slimmed down quite a bit
in the last few weeks
im just so happy big george
and idgie got off
i would have killed frank
bennett if i couldve
did anybody really
think she did it
some said yes
some said no
course the only one who really
knew was frank bennett
and you know what they say
dead men tell no tales
towandaaa

after ruth died and
the railroad stopped runnin
the cafe shut down and everybody
just scattered to the winds
it was never more than just
a little knockabout place

the heart of the town
just stopped beating
its funny how
a little place like this
brought so
many people together
ill remember you
when ive forgotten
all the rest

were the best
when there is no more

quicker than anyone
that i knew
now when the
roses fade

didnt i care
didnt i sleep
and didnt i weep beside you
with the rain that
was blowing in your hair
ohohohohoh

when the wind blows
on through
the piney wood
it was you who came
right through for me baby
it was you
who understood
though id never say
that i turned the way
that you
have led me to
darling in the end
