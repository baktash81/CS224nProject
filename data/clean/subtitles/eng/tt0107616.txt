one thing constant never
sigh
let go
blithe bonny
converting sounds woe
hey nonny nonny
sing ditties
sing dumps
dull heavy
fraud men ever
since summer first leafy
sigh let go
blithe bonny
converting sounds woe
hey nonny nonny
sigh ladies sigh
men deceivers ever
one foot sea one shore
one thing constant never
sigh let go
blithe bonny
converting sounds woe
hey nonny nonny
sing ditties sing
dumps dull heavy
fraud men ever
since summer first leafy
sigh let go
blithe bonny
converting sounds woe
hey nonny nonny
