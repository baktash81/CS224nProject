 the fraud of men

 but let them go
 and be you blithe

 converting all
 your sounds of woe

my lord 
i learn in this letter   
   that don pedro of aragon   
   comes this night to messina 
he is very near by this 
he was not three leagues off when i left him 
how many gentlemen have you lost
in this action 
but few of any sort  and none of name 
i find here that don pedro hath bestowed   
   much honor on a young florentine
called claudio 
he hath borne himself beyond
the promise of his age   
   doing  in the figure of a lamb 
the feats of a lion 
is signior mountanto returned
from the wars or no 
i know none of that name  lady 
my cousin means signior benedick of padua 
he s returned and as pleasant as ever he was 
i pray you  how many hath he killed
and eaten in these wars 
but how many hath he killed 
for indeed i promised to eat all of his killing 
he hath done good service
and a good soldier too  lady 
and a good soldier to a lady 
 but what is he to a lord 
 a lord to a lord 
a man to a man 
stuffed with all honorable virtues 
it is so  indeed 
he is no less than a stuffed man 
you must not  sir  mistake my niece 
there is a kind of merry war
betwixt signior benedick and her 
they never meet but there s
a skirmish of wit between them 
who is his companion now 
he hath every month a new sworn brother 
he is most in the company
of the right noble claudio 
o  lord 
he will hang upon him like a disease 
he is sooner caught than the pestilence 
and the taker runs presently mad 
god help the noble claudio 
if he have caught the benedick   
   it will cost him a thousand pound
ere he be cured 
i will keep friends with you  lady 
 do  good friend 
 you will never run mad  niece 
no  not till a hot january 
don pedro is approaching 
good signior leonato 
are you come to meet your trouble 
the fashion of the world is to avoid cost 
and you encounter it 
never came trouble to my house
in the likeness of your grace 
my lord 
i think this is your daughter 
her mother hath many times told me so 
were you in doubt  sir  that you asked her 
signior benedick  no 
if signior leonato be her father   
   she would not have his head on her shoulders
for all messina 
i wonder that you will still be talking 
signior benedick  nobody marks you 
what  my dear lady disdain 
are you yet living 
is it possible disdain should die   
   while she hath such meet food
to feed it as signior benedick 
courtesy itself must convert to disdain
if you come in her presence 
then is courtesy a turncoat 
but it is certain i am loved of all ladies 
only you excepted   
   and i would i could find in my heart
that i had not a hard heart  for i love none 
a dear happiness to women 
they would else be troubled
with a pernicious suitor 
i thank god and my cold blood 
i am of your humor for that 
i had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me 
god keep your ladyship still in that mind   
   so some gentleman or other shall  scape
a predestinate scratched face 
scratching could not make it worse 
an  twere such a face as yours were 
well  you are a rare parrot teacher 
a bird of my tongue is better
than a beast of yours 
i would my horse had
the speed of your tongue  but   
   keep your way  in god s name i have done 
you always end with a jade s trick 
i know you of old 
signior claudio  signior benedick   
   my dear friend leonato hath invited you all 
i tell him we shall stay here at the least a month 
let me bid you welcome  my lord 
being reconciled to the prince  your brother   
   i owe you all duty 
i thank you 
i am not of many words   
   but i thank you 
please it your grace lead on 
your hand  leonato  we will go together 
benedick 
didst thou note
the daughter of signior leonato 
i noted her not  but i looked on her 
is she not a modest young lady 
do you question me
for my simple true judgment   
   or would you have me speak after my custom 
a professed tyrant to their sex 
no  i pray thee speak in sober judgment 
why    faith me thinks
she s too low for a high praise   
   too brown for a fair praise 
and too little for a great praise 
this commendation i can afford her 
that were she other  she were unhandsome   
   and being no other but as she is 
i do not like her 
thou thinkest i am in sport 
i pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her 
would you buy her  that you enquire after her 
can the world buy such a jewel 
yea  and a case to put it into 
but speak you this with a sad brow 
in mine eyes 
she is the sweetest lady that ever i looked on 
i can see yet without spectacles
and i see no such matter 
there s her cousin 
an  she were not possessed with a fury   
   exceeds her as much in beauty as
the first of may doth the last of december 
but i hope you have no intent to turn husband 
have you 
i would scarce trust myself   
   though i had sworn the contrary   
   if hero would be my wife 
is t come to this 
shall i never see
a bachelor of three score again 
gentlemen 
what secret hath held you here 
that you followed not to leonato s 
he is in love 
with who  that is your grace s part 
with hero   
   leonato s short daughter 
amen  if you love her 
for the lady is very well worthy 
 you speak this to fetch me in 
 by my troth  i speak my thought 
 and in faith  my lord  i spoke mine 
 and  by my two faiths and troths  i spoke mine 
 that i love her  i feel 
 that she is worthy  i know 
that i neither feel how she should be loved
nor know how she is worthy   
   is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me 
i will die in it at the stake 
thou wast ever an obstinate heretic
in the despite of beauty 
that a woman conceived me   
   l thank her 
that she brought me up 
i likewise give her most humble thanks 
but that i will hang my   
   bugle in an invisible baldric   
   all women shall pardon me 
i will live a bachelor 
i shall see thee  ere i die  look pale with love 
with anger  with sickness 
or with hunger  my lord   
   not with love 
well  as time shall try 
 in time the savage bull doth bear the yoke  
the savage bull may 
but if ever the sensible benedick bear it   
   pluck off the bull s horns
and set them in my forehead 
and let me be vilely painted
and in such great letters as they write 
 here is good horse to hire  
let them signify under my sign 
 here you may see benedick  the married man  
benedick 
repair to leonato s 
tell him i will not fail him at supper 
for indeed he hath made great preparation 
examine your conscience 
and so i leave you 
hath leonato any son  my lord 
no child but hero  she s his only heir 
dost thou affect her  claudio 
my lord 
when you went onward on this ended action   
   i looked upon her with a soldier s eye 
that liked   
   but had a rougher task in hand
than to drive liking to the name of love 
but now   
   i am returned and that war thoughts
have left their places vacant   
   in their rooms come thronging soft   
   and delicate desires   
   all prompting me how fair young hero is 
saying   
   i liked her ere i went to wars 
thou wilt be like a lover presently
and tire the hearer with a book of words 
if thou dost love fair hero  cherish it 
and i will break with her and with her father
and thou shalt have her 
i know we shall have reveling tonight 
i will assume thy part in some disguise and   
   tell fair hero i am claudio 
and in her bosom  i ll unclasp my heart   
   and take her hearing prisoner 
with the force and   
   strong encounter of my amorous tale 
then  after to her father will i break   
   and the conclusion is   
   she shall be thine 
in practice let us put it presently 
what the good year  my lord 
why are you thus out of measure sad 
there is no measure
in the occasion that breeds 
therefore the sadness is without limit 
you should hear reason 
and when i have heard it   
   what blessing brings it 
i cannot hide what i am 
i must be sad when i have cause
and smile at no man s jests   
   eat when i have stomach   
   and wait for no man s leisure   
   sleep when i am drowsy   
   and tend on no man s business   
   laugh   
   when i am merry   
   and claw no man in his humor 
but you must not make full show of this
till you may do so without controlment 
you have of late
stood out against your brother   
   and he hath ta en you newly into his grace   
   where it is impossible
you should take true root   
   but by the fair weather that you make yourself 
i had rather be a canker in a hedge   
   than a rose in his grace 
in this  though i cannot be said to be
a flattering  honest man   
   it must not be denied
but i am a plain dealing villain 
if i had my mouth   
   l would bite 
if i had my liberty   
   l would do my liking 
in the meantime   
   let me be that i am and seek not to alter me 
borachio 
what news 
i can give you intelligence
of an intended marriage 
will it serve for any model to build mischief on 
marry  it is your brother s right hand 
who 
 the most exquisite claudio 
 even he 
how came you to this 
i heard it agreed upon that the prince
should woo hero for himself   
   and having obtained her 
give her to count claudio 
come 
come  let us thither 
this may prove food to my displeasure 
that young start up hath all
the glory of my overthrow 
if i can cross him any way   
   i bless myself every way 
you are both sure   
   and will assist me 
to the death  my lord 
 shall we go prove what s to be done 
 we ll wait upon your lordship 
 was not count john here at supper 
 i saw him not 
how tartly that gentleman looks 
i never can see him but
i am heart burned an hour after 
he s of a very melancholy disposition 
he were an excellent man that were made
just in the midway between him and benedick 
the one is too like an image and says nothing 
and the other too like my lady s eldest son   
   evermore tattling 
then half signior benedick s tongue   
   in count john s mouth   
   and half count john s melancholy
in signior benedick s face 
with a good leg 
and a good foot  uncle 
and money enough in his purse 
such a man would win any woman in the world 
if he could get her good will 
by my troth  niece  thou wilt never get thee
a husband  if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue 
lord  i could not endure a husband
with a beard on his face 
i d rather lie in the woolen 
you may light on a husband that hath no beard 
and what should i do with him 
dress him in my apparel
and make him my waiting gentlewoman 
he that hath a beard is more than a youth 
and he that hath no beard is less than a man 
and he that is more than a youth is not for me 
and he that is less than a man  i am not for him 
yet in faith  she s too cursed 
well  then  go you into hell 
no  but to the gate 
and there will the devil meet me
like an old cuckold   
   with horns on his head  and say 
 get you to heaven  beatrice 
 here s no place for you maids 
so away to saint peter for the heavens 
he shows me where the bachelors sit 
and there live we as merry as the day is long 
well  niece 
i hope you will be ruled by your father 
yes  faith 
it is my cousin s duty to make curtsy   
   and say   father  as it please you  
but yet for all that  cousin 
let him be a handsome fellow   
   or else make another curtsy
and say   father  as it please me  
daughter   
   remember what i told you 
if the prince do solicit you in that kind   
   you know your answer 
well  niece 
i hope to see you one day fitted with a husband 
not till god make men
of some other metal than earth 
cousin  you apprehend passing shrewdly 
i have a good eye  uncle 
i can see a church by daylight 
the revellers are entering 
lady  will you walk about with your friend 
i know you well enough 
you are signior antonio 
at a word  i am not 
i know you by the waggling of your head 
at a word  i am not 
come  come  do you think i do not know you
by your excellent wit 
can virtue hide itself 
go to  mum  you are he 
graces will appear  and there s an end 
well  i would you did like me 
so would not i  for i have many ill qualities 
 which is one 
 i say my prayers aloud 
 will you not tell me who told you  sir 
 no  you shall pardon me 
 nor will you not tell me who you are 
 not now 
that i was disdainful   
   and that i had my good wit
out of the  hundred merry tales  
well  this was signior benedick that said so 
what s he 
i m sure you know him well enough 
not i  believe me 
did he never make you laugh 
i pray you  what is he 
why  he is the prince s jester 
a very dull fool 
his only gift is in devising impossible slanders 
none but libertines delight in him 
for he both pleases men and angers them   
   and then they laugh at him and beat him 
i am sure he is in the fleet 
i would he had boarded me 
when i know the gentleman 
i ll tell him what you say 
do 
we must follow the leaders 
in every good thing 
are not you signior benedick 
you know me well  i am he 
signior 
you are very near my brother in his love 
he is enamoured on hero 
i pray you  dissuade him from her 
she is no equal for his birth 
how know you he loves her 
i heard him swear his affection 
so did i  too 
and he swore he would marry her tonight 
come  let us to the banquet 
thus answer i in name of benedick   
   but hear these ill news
with the ears of claudio 
 tis certain so   
   the prince woos for himself 
friendship is constant in all other things   
   save in the office and affairs of love 
this is an accident of hourly proof   
   which i mistrusted not 
farewell  therefore  hero 
 count claudio 
 yea  the same 
 come  will you go with me 
 whither 
about your own business 
 the prince hath got your hero 
 i wish him joy of her 
did you think the prince
would have served you thus 
i pray you  leave me 
alas  poor hurt fowl 
but that my lady beatrice should know me 
and not know me 
the prince s fool 
i am not so reputed 
it is the base  the bitter disposition of beatrice   
   that puts the world into her person
and so gives me out 
well   
   i ll be revenged as i may 
now  signior  where s the count 
troth  my lord  i found him here
as melancholy as a lodge in a warren 
i told him  and i think i told him true   
   that your grace had got the good will
of this young lady 
the lady beatrice hath a quarrel to you 
the gentleman that danced with her
told her she is much wronged by you 
she misused me past the endurance of a block 
she told me  not thinking i had been myself 
that i was the prince s jester   
   that i was duller than a great thaw   
   huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me   
   that i stood like a man at a mark   
   with a whole army shooting at me 
she speaks poniards   
   and every word stabs 
if her breath were terrible as her terminations 
there were no living near her 
she would infect to the north star 
so  indeed  all disquiet 
horror and perturbation follows her 
look  here she comes 
will your grace command me any service
to the world s end 
i will go on the slightest errand now
to the antipodes   
   that you can devise to send me on 
i will fetch you a hair off
the great cham s beard   
   do you any embassage to the pigmies   
   rather than hold three words 
conference with this harpy 
you have no employment for me 
none  but to desire your good company 
o god  sir  here s a dish i love not 
i cannot endure my lady tongue 
come  lady  come 
you have lost the heart of signior benedick 
indeed  my lord 
he lent it me awhile 
and i gave him use for it   
   a double heart for his single one 
marry  once before he won it of me 
with false dice 
therefore your grace may well say i have lost it 
you have put him down  lady 
you have put him down 
so i would not he should do me  my lord   
   lest i should prove the mother of fools 
i have brought count claudio 
whom you sent me to seek 
why  how now  count  wherefore art thou sad 
not sad  my lord 
 how then  sick 
 neither  my lord 
the count is neither sad  nor sick   
   nor merry  nor well   
   but civil count   
   civil as an orange 
and something of that jealous complexion 
i  faith  lady  i think your blazon to be true   
   though i ll be sworn  if he be so 
his conceit is false 
here  claudio 
i have wooed in thy name   
   and fair hero is won 
i have broke with her father 
and his good will obtained 
name the day of marriage   
   and god give thee joy 
count  take of me my daughter   
   and with her my fortunes 
his grace hath made the match   
   and all grace say amen to it 
speak  count   
    tis your cue 
silence is the perfectest herald of joy 
i were but little happy  if i could say how much 
lady   
   as you are mine   
   i am yours 
speak  cousin 
or  if you cannot  stop his mouth with a kiss 
and let not him speak neither 
in faith  lady  you have a merry heart 
yea  my lord  i thank it 
poor fool 
it keeps on the windy side of care 
my cousin tells him in his ear
that he is in her heart 
and so she doth  cousin 
good lord  for alliance 
thus goes everyone to the world but i 
and i am sunburnt 
i may sit in a corner
and cry heigh ho for a husband 
lady beatrice  i will get you one 
i would rather have one of your father s getting 
hath your grace ne er a brother like you 
your father got excellent husbands 
if a maid could come by them 
will you have me  lady 
no  my lord   
   unless i might have another for working days 
your grace is too costly to wear every day 
but  i beseech your grace  pardon me 
i was born to speak all mirth and no matter 
your silence most offends me   
   and to be merry best becomes you   
   for  out of question 
you were born in a merry hour 
no  sure  my lord   
   my mother cried 
but then there was a star danced   
   and under that was i born 
cousins 
god give you joy 
by my troth  a pleasant spirited lady 
there s little of the melancholy element in her 
she is never sad but when she sleeps 
and not ever then   
   for i ve heard my daughter say
she hath often dreamt of unhappiness   
   and waked herself with laughing 
she cannot endure to hear tell of a husband 
by no means 
she were an excellent wife for benedick 
if they were but a week married 
they would talk themselves mad 
 claudio  when mean you to go to church 
 tomorrow  my lord 
not till monday  my dear son 
which is hence a just seven night   
   and a time too brief  too 
to have all things answer my mind 
i warrant thee  claudio 
the time shall not go dully by us 
i will  in the interim 
undertake one of hercules  labors   
   which is to bring signior benedick
and the lady beatrice   
   into a mountain of affection 
the one with the other 
i would fain have it a match 
and i doubt not but to fashion it   
   if you minister such assistance
as i give you direction 
my lord  i am for you 
though it cost me 10 nights  watchings 
and i  my lord 
and you  too  gentle hero 
i will do any modest office  my lord 
to help my cousin to a good husband 
if we can do this  cupid is no longer an archer 
his glory shall be ours 
for we are the only love gods 
go with me  i will tell you my drift 
i do much wonder   
   that one man   
   seeing how much another man is a fool
when he dedicates his behaviors to love   
   will  after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others   
   become the argument of
his own scorn by falling in love 
and such a man is claudio 
i have known when there was no music with him
but the drum and the fife   
   and now would he rather hear
the tabor and the pipe 
i have known when he would have
walked 10 mile afoot to see a good armor 
and now will he lie 10 nights awake 
carving the fashion of a new doublet 
he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose 
like an honest man and a soldier 
now is he turned orthography 
his words are a very fantastical banquet   
   just so many strange dishes 
may i be so converted  and see with these eyes 
i cannot tell  i think not 
i will not be sworn   
   but love may transform me to an oyster 
but i ll take my oath on it 
till he hath made an oyster of me   
   he shall never make me such a fool 
one woman is fair  yet i am well 
another is wise  yet i am well 
another  virtuous  yet i am well 
but till all graces be in one woman   
   one woman shall not come in my grace 
rich she shall be  that s certain 
wise  or i ll none 
virtuous  or i ll never cheapen her 
fair  or i ll never look on her 
mild   
   or come not near me 
of good discourse  an excellent musician 
and her hair   
   shall be   
   of what color it please god 
the prince and monsieur love 
i will hide me 
see you where benedick hath hid himself 
very well  my lord 
come  balthasar 
we ll hear that song again 
now  divine air 
now is his soul ravished 
is it not strange that sheeps  guts
should hale souls out of men s bodies 
 sigh no more  ladies
 sigh no more
 men were deceivers ever
 one foot in sea
 and one on shore
 to one thing constant never
 then sigh not so
 but let them go
 and be you blithe
 and bonny
 converting all your sounds of woe
 into hey nonny  nonny
 sing no more ditties
 of dumps so dull and heavy
 the fraud of men
 was ever so
 since summer
 first was leafy
 then sigh not so
 but let them go
 and be you blithe and bonny
 converting all
 your sounds of woe
 into hey nonny  nonny 
 by my troth  a good song 
 and an ill singer  my lord 
no  no  faith  thou singest well enough 
an  he had been a dog that should have
howled thus  they d have hanged him 
come hither  leonato 
what was it you told me of today 
that your niece beatrice was
in love with signior benedick 
i did never think that lady
would have loved any man 
no  nor i neither 
but most wonderful that
she should so dote on signior benedick   
   whom she hath in all outward behaviors
seemed ever to abhor 
is it possible 
maybe she doth but counterfeit 
faith  like enough 
o  god 
counterfeit 
there was never counterfeit of passion
came so near the life of passion   
   as she discovers it 
why 
what effects of passion shows she 
bait the hook well  this fish will bite 
what effects  my lord 
 you heard my daughter tell you how 
 she did  indeed 
how  i pray you 
you amaze me 
i should think this a trick 
but that the gray bearded fellow speaks it 
hath she made her affection
known to benedick 
no  and swears she never will 
that s her torment 
she ll be up 20 times a night   
   and there she ll sit in her smock
till she have writ a sheet of paper 
then down upon her knees she falls  weeps   
   sobs  beats her heart  tears her hair  curses 
 o sweet benedick 
 god give me patience  
she doth indeed  my daughter says so 
my daughter is sometime afeared   
   that she will do a desperate outrage to herself 
it is very true 
 it were good that benedick knew of it 
 to what end 
he would make but a sport of it
and torment the poor lady worse 
i m sorry for her 
i pray you  tell benedick of it 
and hear what he will say 
were it good  think you 
hero thinks surely she will die   
   for she says she will die if he love her not   
   and she will die  ere she make her love known 
and she will die  if he woo her 
if she should make tender of her love 
 tis very possible he ll scorn it   
   for the man  as you know all 
hath a contemptible spirit 
i love benedick well   
   and i could wish he would
modestly examine himself   
   to see how much he is unworthy   
   so good a lady 
my lord  will you walk  dinner is ready 
if he do not dote on her upon this 
i will never trust my expectation 
let the same net be spread for her  and that
must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry 
let us send beatrice to call him in to dinner 
this can be no trick 
the conference was sadly borne 
they have the truth of this from hero 
love me 
why   
   it must be requited 
i hear how i am censured 
they say i will bear myself proudly
if i perceive the love come from her 
they say  too  that she will rather die
than give any sign of affection 
i did never think to marry 
i must not seem proud 
happy are they that hear their detractions
and can put them to mending 
they say the lady is fair 
i can bear them witness 
and virtuous   tis so  i cannot reprove it 
and wise  but for loving me 
by my troth  it is no addition to her wit   
   nor no great argument of her folly   
   for i will be   
   horribly in love with her 
i may chance have some odd quirks   
   and remnants of wit broken on me   
   because i have railed
so long against marriage 
but doth not the appetite alter 
a man loves the meat in his youth
that he cannot endure in his age 
shall these quips and sentences
and paper bullets of the brain   
   awe a man from the career of his humor 
no 
the world must be peopled 
when i said i would die a bachelor   
   l did not think i should live   
   till i were married 
here comes beatrice 
by this day  she s a fair lady 
i do spy some   
   marks of love in her 
against my will i am sent to bid you
come in to dinner 
fair beatrice 
i thank you for your pains 
i took no more pains for those thanks   
   than you take pains to thank me 
if it had been painful  i would not have come 
you take pleasure  then  in the message 
yea 
just so much as you may take
upon a knife s point 
you have no stomach  signior  fare you well 
 against my will  i am sent   
    to bid you come in to dinner  
there s a double meaning in that 
but are you sure that benedick
loves beatrice so entirely 
so says the prince and my new trothed lord 
and did they bid you tell her of it  madam 
they did entreat me to acquaint her of it 
but i persuaded them  if they loved benedick   
   to wish him wrestle with affection
and never let beatrice know 
why did you so 
doth he not deserve as full as fortunate
a bed as beatrice shall couch upon 
o god of love  i know he doth deserve
as much as may be yielded to a man 
but nature never framed a woman s heart
of prouder stuff than that of beatrice 
disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes   
   misprising what they look on 
and her wit values itself so highly   
   that to her all matter else seems weak 
she cannot love 
sure  i think so 
 yet tell her of it  hear what she will say 
 no 
rather i will go to benedick
and counsel him to fight against his passion 
do not do your cousin such a wrong 
she cannot be so much without true judgment   
   having so swift and excellent a wit
as she is prized to have   
   to refuse such a gentleman
as signior benedick 
he is the only man of italy 
always excepted my dear claudio 
 when are you married  madam 
 why  every day 
tomorrow 
she s limed  i warrant you 
we have caught her  madam 
if it prove so  then loving goes by haps 
some cupid kills with arrows  some with traps 
what fire is in mine ears 
can this be true 
stand i condemned for pride
and scorn so much 
contempt  farewell 
and maiden pride  adieu 
no glory lives behind the back of such 
and  benedick   
   love on 
i will requite thee 
taming my wild heart to thy loving hand 
if thou dost love  my kindness shall incite thee   
   to bind our loves up in a holy band 
for others say thou dost deserve  and l   
   believe it   
   better than reportingly 
are you good men and true 
yea 
being chosen for the prince s watch   
   this is your charge 
you are to bid any man stand 
in the prince s name 
how if he will not stand 
why  then  take no note of him  but let him go 
if he will not stand when he is bidden 
he is none of the prince s subjects 
true 
and they are to meddle with none
but the prince s subjects 
you shall also make no noise in the streets 
we will rather sleep than talk 
you speak like an ancient   
   and a most quiet watchman   
   for i cannot see how sleeping should offend 
if you meet a thief   
   you may suspect him 
by virtue of your office   
   to be no true man   
   and  for such kind of men   
   the less you meddle or make with them 
why the more is for your   
   honesty 
you have been always called
a merciful man  partner 
truly  i would not hang a dog by my will   
   much more a man
who hath any honesty in him 
 tis very true 
well  masters 
good night 
an  there be any matter of weight chances   
   call up me 
come  neighbor 
we hear our charge 
let us sit here upon the bench till 2 00 
and then all to bed 
one word more  honest neighbors 
i pray you watch about signior leonato s door   
   for the wedding being there tomorrow 
there is a great coil tonight 
adieu 
be vigitant  i beseech you 
it is so 
the count claudio shall marry
the daughter of leonato 
yea  my lord  but i can cross it 
any bar  any cross  any impediment
will be medicinable to me 
i am sick in displeasure to him   
   and whatsoever comes athwart
his affection ranges evenly with mine 
how canst thou cross this marriage 
not honestly  my lord  but so covertly
that no dishonesty shall appear in me 
show me briefly how 
i think i told your lordship a year since 
how much i am in the favor of margaret   
    the waiting gentlewoman to hero 
 i remember 
i can  at any unseasonable instant of the night   
   appoint her to look out
at her lady s chamber window 
what life is in that
to be the death of this marriage 
well  the poison of that lies in you to temper 
gallants 
i am not   
   as i have been 
so say l 
methinks you are sadder 
i hope he be in love 
old signior  walk aside with me 
i have studied some wise words
to speak to you   
   which these hobby horses must not hear 
for my life  to break with him about beatrice 
my lord and brother  god save you 
good e en  brother 
if your leisure served  i would speak with you 
in private 
if it please you  yet claudio may hear 
what i d speak of concerns him 
what s the matter 
you may think i love you not 
let that appear hereafter 
and aim better at me by that i now will manifest 
 means your lordship to be married tomorrow 
 you know he does 
i know not that  when he knows what i know 
hero 
the lady is disloyal 
if you love her now  tomorrow wed her 
but it would better fit your honor
to change your mind 
conrade 
what  conrade 
conrade  i say 
here  man  i am at thy elbow 
mass  and my elbow itched 
i thought there would a scab follow 
i will owe thee an answer for that 
and now forward with thy tale 
 sit close  then 
 some treason  masters 
i know him 
i have  tonight  wooed margaret   
   the lady hero s gentlewoman   
   by the name of hero 
i shall first tell thee how the prince 
claudio  and my master   
   planted by my master  don john   
   saw this   
   amiable encounter 
and thought they margaret was hero 
aye  and away went claudio  enraged 
we charge you  in the prince s name  stand 
call up the right master constable 
we have here recovered   
   the most dangerous piece of lechery
that was ever known in the commonwealth 
 masters 
 never speak 
there  sir 
what would you with me  neighbors 
sir  our watch tonight 
excepting your worship s presence   
   hath ta en a couple of
as arrant knaves as any in messina 
a good old man  sir  he will be talking 
as they say  when the age is in  the wit is out 
well said  i  faith  neighbor verges 
well  god s a good man 
an  two men ride of a horse 
one must ride behind 
 all men are not alike  alas  good neighbor 
 indeed  neighbor  he comes too short of you 
gifts that god gives 
neighbors  you are tedious 
it pleases your worship to say so   
   but we are the poor duke s officers 
but truly  for mine own part 
if i were as tedious as a king   
   l could find in my heart to bestow it all   
   on your worship 
all thy tediousness on me 
i would fain know what you have to say 
our watch  sir  have indeed comprehended
two auspicious persons   
   and we would this morning
have them examined before your worship 
take their examination yourself  and bring it me 
i am now in great haste 
as it may appear unto you 
drink some wine ere you go 
we are now to examination these men 
meet me at the jail 
you come hither  my lord  to marry this lady 
no 
to be married to her 
you come to marry her 
lady   
   you come hither to be married to this count 
i do 
if either of you have any inward impediment
why you should not be conjoined   
   l charge you  on your souls  to utter it 
 know you any  hero 
 none  my lord 
 know you any  count 
 i dare make his answer  none 
stand thee by  friar 
father  by your leave   
   will you  with free  unconstrained soul 
give me this maid  your daughter 
as freely  son  as god did give her me 
and what have i to give you back 
whose worth may counterpoise this   
   rich   
   and precious gift 
nothing  unless you render her again 
sweet prince  you learn me noble thankfulness 
there  leonato  take her back again 
give not this rotten orange to your friend 
she s but the sign and semblance of her honor 
behold how like a maid she blushes here 
would you not swear   
   all you that see her  that she were a maid 
by these exterior shows 
but she is none 
she knows the heat   
   of a luxurious bed 
 what do you mean  my lord 
 not to be married   
   not to knit my soul to an approved wanton 
no 
dear my lord   
   if you  in your own proof   
   have vanquished the resistance of her youth   
    and made defeat of her virginity  
 no  leonato 
i never tempted her with word too large 
but   
   as a brother to his sister   
   showed bashful sincerity and comely love 
and seemed i ever otherwise to you 
you seem to me as dian in her orb 
but you are more intemperate in your blood
than venus   
   or those pampered animals   
   that rage in savage sensuality 
is my lord well  that he doth speak so wide 
 sweet prince  why speak not you 
 what should i speak 
i stand dishonored  that have gone about
to link my dear friend to a common stale 
no 
what man was he talked with you yesternight   
   out at your window betwixt 12 00 and 1 00 
i talk d with no man at that hour  my lord 
why  then you are no maiden 
leonato  i m sorry you must hear 
upon mine honor  myself  my brother
and this grieved count did see her   
   hear her  at that hour last night   
   talk with a ruffian at her chamber window
who hath indeed  most like a liberal villain   
   confessed the vile encounters they have had
1 000 times in secret 
how now  cousin 
come  let us go 
these things  come thus to light 
smother her spirits up 
cousin  wherefore sink you down 
hath no man s dagger here   
   a point for me 
do not live  hero 
do not ope thine eyes 
hero 
grieved l  i had but one 
why had i one 
why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes 
leonato 
 she is fallen into a pit of ink 
 sir  be patient 
for my part  i am so attired in wonder 
i know not what to say 
on my soul  my cousin is belied 
lady  were you her bedfellow last night 
no  truly not  although  until last night 
i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow 
confirmed 
would the two princes lie  and claudio lie 
hence from her  let her die 
hear me a little 
lady  what man is he you are accused of 
they know that do accuse me  i know none 
there is some strange misprision in the princes 
two of them have the very bent of honor 
if their wisdom s been misled in this 
the practice of it lives in john the bastard 
if they wrong her honor 
the proudest of them shall well hear of it 
pause awhile 
and let my counsel sway you in this case 
your daughter here the princes left for dead 
let her awhile be secretly kept in 
and publish it   
   that she is dead indeed 
what shall become of this 
she dying  as it must be so maintained   
   upon the instant that she was accused   
   shall be lamented  pitied   
   and excused of every hearer 
so will it fare with claudio 
when he shall hear she died upon his words   
   the idea of her life   
   shall sweetly creep into
his study of imagination   
   and every lovely organ of her life   
   shall come appareled in more precious habit 
than when she lived indeed 
then shall he mourn   
   and wish he had not so accused her 
signior leonato  let the friar advise you 
being that i flow in grief   
   the smallest twine may lead me 
 tis well consented 
presently away 
come  lady 
die to live 
this wedding day perhaps is but prolonged 
have patience and endure 
lady beatrice  have you wept all this while 
yea   
    and i will weep a while longer 
 i will not desire that 
you have no reason  i do it freely 
surely i do believe your fair cousin is wronged 
how much might the man deserve of me
that would right her 
is there any way to show such friendship 
a very even way  but no such friend 
may a man do it 
it is a man s office   
   but not yours 
i do love nothing in the world so well as you 
is not that strange 
as strange as the thing i know not 
it were as possible for me to say
i loved nothing so well as you 
but believe me not 
and yet i lie not 
i confess nothing  nor i deny nothing 
 i am sorry for my cousin 
 by my sword  beatrice  thou lovest me 
do not swear  and eat it 
i will swear by it that you love me  and i
will make him eat it that says i love not you 
why  then  god forgive me 
what offence  sweet beatrice 
you have stayed me in a happy hour 
 i was about to protest i loved you 
 and do it with all thy heart 
i love you with so much of my heart
that none is left to protest 
come 
bid me do anything for thee 
kill claudio 
not for the wide world 
you kill me to deny it 
 fare thee well 
 tarry  sweet beatrice 
i am gone  though i am here 
there is no love in you 
 nay  i pray you  let me go 
 beatrice 
 in faith  i will go 
 we ll be friends first 
you dare easier be friends with me
than fight with mine enemy 
is claudio thine enemy 
is he not approved in the height a villain   
   that hath slandered  scorned 
dishonored my kinswoman 
o  that i were a man 
what   
   bear her in hand until they come
to take hands   
   and then  with public accusation   
   uncovered slander  unmitigated rancor    
o god  that i were a man 
i would eat his heart in the marketplace 
hear me  beatrice 
talk with a man out at a window 
 a proper saying 
 nay  but  beatrice  
sweet hero 
she is wronged  she is slandered   
   she is undone 
he is now as valiant as hercules
that only tells a lie and swears it 
i cannot be a man with wishing   
   therefore i will die a woman with grieving 
by this hand  i love thee 
use it for my love some other way
than swearing by it 
think you in your soul
the count claudio hath wronged hero 
yea 
as sure as i have a thought   
   or a soul 
enough 
i am engaged 
i will challenge him 
go 
comfort your cousin 
i must say she is dead 
and so   
   farewell 
is our whole dissembly appeared 
which be the malefactors 
marry  that am l   
   and my partner 
but which are the offenders
that are to be examined 
what is your name  friend 
borachio 
write down  borachio 
 yours  sirrah 
 i am a gentleman  sir 
and my name is conrade 
write down  master gentleman conrade 
masters  it is proved already that you are   
   little better than false knaves 
how answer you for yourselves 
marry  sir   
   we say we are none 
you 
sir  i say to you  we are none 
have you writ down  they are none 
master constable 
you go not the way to examine 
you must call forth the watch
that are their accusers 
let the watch come forth 
masters  i charge you  in the prince s name 
accuse these men 
this man said  sir  that don john 
the prince s brother  was a villain 
 write down prince john a villain 
 master constable 
pray thee  fellow  peace 
i do not like thy look  i promise thee 
 what heard you him say else 
 marry 
that he had received 1 000 ducats of don john   
   for accusing the lady hero wrongfully 
 flat burglary as ever was committed 
 yea  by mass  that it is 
 what else 
 and that count claudio did mean   
   upon his words   
   to disgrace hero before the whole assembly 
and not marry her 
thou wilt be condemned
into everlasting redemption for this 
 what else 
 this is all 
prince john is  this morning 
secretly stolen away 
hero was in this manner accused 
in this very manner refused   
   and upon the grief of this  suddenly died 
master constable   
   let these men be bound 
and brought to leonato s 
 come  let them be opinioned 
 let them be in the hands    
off  coxcomb 
god s my life  where s the sexton 
let him write down
the prince s officer coxcomb 
come  bind them  thou naughty varlet 
away  you are an ass 
you are an ass 
dost thou not suspect my place 
dost thou not suspect my years 
o that he were here to write me down an ass 
but  masters  remember  i am an ass 
though it be not written down 
forget not that i am an ass 
if you go on thus  you will kill yourself 
bring me a father that so loved his child   
   whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine 
and bid him speak of patience 
but there is no such man 
for  brother  men can counsel
and speak comfort to that grief   
   which they themselves not feel 
but  tasting it  their counsel turns to passion 
 but  
 i pray thee  peace 
i will be flesh and blood   
   for there was never yet philosopher
that could endure the toothache patiently 
yet bend not all the harm upon yourself 
make those that do offend you suffer  too 
there thou speakest reason  nay  i will do so 
my soul doth tell me hero is belied   
   and that shall claudio know 
so shall the prince   
    and all of them that thus dishonor her 
 here comes the prince and claudio hastily 
 good e en

 some haste  my lord 
well  fare you well  my lord

thou dissembler  thou 
nay  never lay thy hand upon thy sword 
i fear thee not 
marry  beshrew my hand 
if it should give your age such cause of fear 
in faith  my hand meant nothing to my sword 
tush  tush  man  never fleer and jest at me 
i speak not like a dotard nor a fool 
 i say thou has belied mine innocent child 
 you say not right  old man

nay  as i am a gentleman  i will 
 brother  
 content yourself 
god knows i loved my niece 
and she is dead   
   slandered to death by villains   
   scrambling  outfacing 
fashion monging boys   
   that lie  and cog   
    and flout  deprave and slander  
 brother antony 
 tis no matter  do not you meddle 
let me deal in this 
gentlemen both  we will not wake your patience 
my heart is sorry for your daughter s death   
   but  on my honor  she was charged
with nothing but what was true   
   and very full of proof 
my lord  
i will not hear you 
no 
come  brother  away 
i will be heard 
and shall   
   or some of us will smart for it 
see  here comes the man we went to seek 
 now  signior  what news 
 good day  my lord

we had like to have had our two noses
snapped off with two old men 
shall i speak a word in your ear 
you are a villain  i jest not 
i will make it good how you dare
and when you dare 
do me right  or i will protest your cowardice 
you have killed a sweet lady 
and her death shall fall heavy on you 
fare you well  boy 
you know my mind 
my lord   
   for your many courtesies i thank you 
i must discontinue your company 
your brother the bastard is fled from messina 
you have  among you 
killed a sweet and innocent lady 
for my lord lackbeard there   
   he and i shall meet 
till then   
   peace be with him 
he is in earnest 
 in most profound earnest 
 and hath challenged thee 
most sincerely 
officers   
   what offence have these men done 
marry  sir  they have committed false report 
moreover  they spoke untruths 
secondarily  they are slanders 
sixth and lastly  they belied a lady 
thirdly  they verified unjust things 
and  to conclude  they are lying knaves 
who have you offended  masters 
that you are thus bound to your answer 
this learned constable is too cunning
to be understood 
i have deceived even your very eyes 
what your wisdoms could not discover   
   these shallow fools have brought to light   
   who in the night   
   overheard me confessing to this man   
   how don john  your brother   
   incensed me to slander the lady hero 
how you saw me   
   court   
   margaret 
how you disgraced hero   
   when you should marry her 
the lady is dead   
   upon mine and my master s false accusation 
sweet hero 
come  bring away the plaintiffs 
by this time  our sexton hath reformed
signior leonato of the matter 
and  masters   
   do not forget to specify 
when time and place shall serve   
   that i am an ass 
here  here   
   comes master signior leonato 
and the sexton  too 
which is the villain 
let me see his eyes 
if you would know your wronger   
   look on me 
art thou the slave that with thy tongue
hast killed mine innocent child 
yea 
 even i alone 
 no 
not so  villain  thou beliest thyself 
here stand a pair of honorable men 
a third is fled  that had a hand in it 
i thank you  princes  for my daughter s death 
record it with your high and worthy deeds 
 twas bravely done  if you bethink you of it 
i know not how to pray your patience 
yet i must speak 
choose your revenge yourself 
impose me to what penance
your invention can lay upon my sin 
yet sinned i not but in mistaking 
by my soul  nor l 
i cannot bid you bid my daughter live 
that were impossible  but i pray you both   
   possess the people in messina here
how innocent she died 
and if your love can labor ought
in sad invention   
   hang her an epitaph upon her tomb   
   and sing it to her bones  sing it tonight 
tomorrow morning come you to my house   
   and since you could not be my son in law   
   be yet my nephew 
my brother hath a daughter   
   almost the copy of my child that s dead   
   and she alone is heir to both of us 
give her the right
you should have given her cousin   
   and so dies my revenge 
o noble sir   
   your overkindness doth wring tears from me 
i do   
   embrace your offer   
   and dispose for henceforth of poor claudio 
tomorrow  then  i will expect your coming 
tonight i take my leave 
this naughty man shall  face to face 
be brought to margaret   
   who i believe was packed in all this wrong 
no  by my soul  she was not   
   nor knew not what she did
when she spoke to me   
   but always hath been just and virtuous
in any thing that i do know by her 
moreover  sir 
which indeed is not under white and black   
   this plaintiff here  the offender 
did call me  ass  
i beseech you 
let it be remembered in his punishment 
i thank thee for thy care and honest pains 
your worship speaks like a most thankful
and reverend youth   
   and i praise god for you 
there s for thy pains 
god save the foundation 
go 
i discharge thee of thy prisoner 
and i thank thee 
i leave with your worship an arrant knave 
which i beseech your worship   
   to correct yourself  for the example of others 
god restore you to health 
i humbly give you leave to depart 
and if a merry meeting   
   may be wished   
   god prohibit it 
come  neighbor 
until tomorrow morning  lords  farewell 
farewell  my lords  we look for you tomorrow 
we will not fail 
tonight   
   i ll mourn   
   with hero 
 done to death   
    by slanderous tongues   
    was the hero   
    that here lies 
 death  in guerdon of her wrongs   
    gives her fame   
    which never dies 
 so the life   
    that died with shame   
    lives in death   
    with glorious fame  
 pardon  goddess of the night
 those that slew thy virgin knight
 for the which  with songs of woe
 round about her tomb
 they go
 midnight
 assist our moan
 help us
 to sigh and groan
 heavily  heavily
 heavily 
 the god of love
 that sits above
 and knows me
 and knows me
 how pitiful i deserve     
i mean in singing 
but in loving   
   leander  the good swimmer 
troilus  the first employer of panders   
   and a whole bookful of these
quondam carpet mangers   
   whose names yet run smoothly
in the even road of a blank verse   
   why  they were never so truly turned   
   over and over   
   as my poor self in love 
marry  i cannot show it in rhyme 
i have tried 
i can find out no rhyme to  lady   but   
    baby   an innocent rhyme 
for  scorn    horn   a hard rhyme 
for  school    fool   a babbling rhyme 
very ominous endings 
no  i was not born under a rhyming planet   
   nor i cannot woo in festival terms 
sweet beatrice   
   wouldst thou come when i called thee 
yea  signior  and depart when you bid me 
stay but till then 
 then  is spoken  fare you well now 
and yet   
   ere i go   
   let me go with that i came   
   which is with knowing what passed
between you and claudio 
only foul words  and thereupon i will kiss thee 
foul words is but foul wind 
and foul wind is but foul breath 
foul breath is noisome 
therefore i will depart unkissed 
thou hast frighted the word
out of his right sense  so forcible is thy wit 
but i must tell thee plainly 
claudio undergoes my challenge   
   and either i must shortly hear from him   
   or i will subscribe him a coward 
and  i pray thee now   
   tell me   
   for which of my bad parts
did thou first fall in love with me 
for them all together   
   which maintains so politic a state of evil   
   that they will not admit any good part
to intermingle with them 
but for which of my good parts
did you first suffer love for me 
suffer love  a good epithet 
i do suffer love indeed 
for i love thee against my will 
in spite of your heart  i think  alas   
   poor heart 
if you spite it for my sake 
i will spite it for yours   
   for i will never love that which my friend hates 
thou and i are too wise to woo peaceably 
and now tell me   
   how doth your cousin 
very   
   ill 
and how do you 
very ill too 
serve god   
   love me   
   and mend 
 madam 
 here comes one in haste 
you must come to your uncle 
yonder s old coil at home 
it is proved
my lady hero hath been falsely accused   
   the prince and claudio mightily abused   
   and don john is the author of all   
   who is fled and gone 
will you come   
   presently 
will you go hear this news  signior 
i will live in thy heart  die in thy lap 
and be buried in thy eyes   
   and moreover i will go with thee to thy uncle s 
did i not tell you she was innocent 
so are the prince and claudio  who accused her
upon the error you heard debated 
but margaret was in some fault for this 
well  i am glad that all things sort so well 
now  daughter 
and you gentlewomen all  withdraw   
   and when i send for you  come hither masked 
the prince and claudio promised
by this hour to visit me 
you know your office  brother 
you must be father to your brother s daughter 
and give her to young claudio 
which i will do with confirmed countenance 
friar  i must entreat your pains  i think 
 to do what  signior 
 to bind me  or undo me  one of them 
signior leonato  truth it is  good signior   
   your niece regards me with an eye of favor 
the sight whereof i think you had from me 
from claudio and the prince 
 but what s your will 
 your answer  sir  is enigmatical 
but  for my will  my will is your good will   
   may stand with ours 
this day to be conjoined   
   in the state of   
   honorable marriage   
   in which  good friar  i shall desire your help 
 my heart is with your liking 
 and my help 
here come the prince and claudio 
good morrow to this fair assembly 
good morrow  prince  good morrow  claudio 
we here attend you 
are you yet determined today
to marry with my brother s daughter 
call her forth  brother 
here s the friar  ready 
which is the lady i must seize upon 
this same is she   
   and i do give you her 
sweet   
   let me see your face 
no  that you shall not   
   till you take her hand before this friar
and swear to marry her 
give me your hand  before this holy friar 
i am your husband   
   if you like of me 
hero that is dead 
she died  my lord  but whiles her slander lived 
and when i lived   
   i was your other wife 
and when you loved   
   you were my other husband 
one hero died defiled  but i do live   
   and surely as i live   
   i am a maid 
all this amazement can i qualify 
when after that the holy rites are ended   
   i ll tell you largely of fair hero s death 
soft and fair  friar 
which is beatrice 
i answer to that name 
what is your will 
do not you love me 
why  no 
no more than reason 
your uncle  the prince and claudio
have been deceived 
they swore you did 
 do not you love me 
 why  no  no more than reason 
why  then my cousin  margaret  and ursula
are much deceived   
    for they did swear you did 
 they swore you were sick for me 
 they swore you were nigh dead for me 
  tis no such matter 
then   
   you   
    do not love me 
 no  truly  but in friendly recompense 
come  cousin  i am sure you love the gentleman 
i ll be sworn upon it he loves her 
for here s a paper written in his hand   
   a halting sonnet of his own pure brain 
fashioned to beatrice 
and here s another   
   writ in my cousin s hand 
stolen from her pocket   
   containing her affection unto benedick 
a miracle 
here s our own hands against our hearts 
come   
   i will have thee 
but  by this light  i take thee for pity 
i would not deny you 
but  by this good day   
   i yield upon great persuasion   
   and partly to save your life 
for i was told you were in a consumption 
peace 
i will stop your mouth 
how dost thou  benedick   
   the married man 
i ll tell thee what  prince   
   a college of wit crackers cannot
flout me out of my humor 
dost thou think i care for
a satire or an epigram 
no 
since i do purpose to marry   
   i will think nothing to any purpose
that the world can say against it   
   and therefore never flout at me
for what i have said against it 
for man   
   is a giddy thing   
   and this is my conclusion 
for thy part  claudio   
   i did think to have beaten thee   
   but in that thou art like to be my kinsman   
   live unbruised   
   and love my cousin 
come  come  we are friends 
let s have a dance ere we are married   
   that we may lighten our own hearts
and our wives  heels 
we ll have dancing afterward 
first  of my word  therefore play  music 
prince   
   thou art sad 
get thee a wife 
get thee a wife 
my lord  your brother john is ta en in flight 
and brought with armed men back to messina 
think not on him till tomorrow 
i ll devise thee brave punishments for him 
strike up  pipers 
 sigh no more  ladies  sigh no more
 men were deceivers ever
 one foot in sea and one on shore
 to one thing constant never
 then sigh not so
 but let them go
 and be you blithe and bonny
 converting all your sounds of woe
 into hey nonny  nonny 
 sing no more ditties
 sing no more of dumps
 so dull and heavy
 the fraud of men was ever so
 since summer first was leafy
 then sigh not so  but let them go
 and be you blithe and bonny
 converting all your sounds of woe
 into hey nonny  nonny
 sigh no more  ladies  sigh no more
 men were deceivers ever
 one foot in sea and one on shore
 to one thing constant never
 then sigh not so  but let them go
 and be you blithe and bonny
 converting all your sounds of woe
 into hey nonny  nonny
 sing no more ditties  sing no more
 of dumps so dull and heavy
 the fraud of men was ever so
