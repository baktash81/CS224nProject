youre not badlooking
a girl like you doesnt
have to starve
theres a new place
it just opened

ask for kenny k
tell him i sent you

take the money
forget you was ever there
how much more is there
another five reels
lights up
this is it
this is what we get
for our 40000 denham
another one of your safari
pictures
you promised us romantic scenes
with bruce baxter and maureen mckenzie
come on fellows
you know the deal
we agreed to push
maureens start date
so she could get
her teeth fixed
its not the principle
of the thing its the money
carl youve been in production
for over two months
trust me bruce and maureen
are gonna steam up the screen
once we get them on the ship
what ship
the one that we hired
to get to the location
what location carl youre supposed
to be shooting on the back lot
yes i understand that
but fellows were not
making that film anymore
and ill tell you why
the story has changed the
script has been rewritten
life intervened
ive come into possession
of a map
the sole surviving record
of an uncharted island
a place that was thought
to exist only in myth
until now
whoa carl slow down
is he asking for more money
hes asking us to fund
a wild goose chase
im talking about a primitive
world never before seen by man
the ruins of an entire
civilization
the most spectacular
thing youve ever seen
thats where
ill shoot my picture
will there be boobies
boobies
jigglies jiblonkas bazooms
in my experience people
only go to these films
to observe the undraped
form of the native girls
what are you an idiot
you think they asked de mille
if he would waste his time on nudie shots
no they respected the filmmaker
they showed some class
not that youd know
what that means you cheap lowlife
would you step
out for a moment carl
zelman and associates
give me that quick
you wont like it
its nonalcoholic
preston you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business
dont write him off fellows
hes hotheaded sure
but carl denhams made
some interesting pictures
hes had a lot of nearsuccess
hes a preening selfpromoter
an ambitious notalent the guys got
loser written all over him
i understand
your disappointment
he cant direct he
doesnt have the smarts
hes washed up
its all over town
this jumpedup
little turds gonna bankrupt us
the animal footage has value
sure universal are desperate
for stock footage
then sell it scrap the picture
we got to retrieve something
from this debacle
get him back in
mr denham
i want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour
no carl you cant do this
tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure
its not ethical what
are they gonna do sue me
they can get in line
im not gonna let
them kill my film
you realize that none of the camera
equipment is on board
we have no permits no visas
thats why i have you preston
we have no insurance we have
no foreign currency
in fact we have no
currency of any kind
hes there
get in there whos gonna
pay for the ship
get in
you get out of there come here
step on it step on it
get out youre
finished denham
dont worry preston ive had
a lot of practice at this
im real good at crapping
the crappers
red label 80 proof
to be packed in a crate
marked lemonade
you got it
tell maureen she doesnt have
six hours to put on her face
if she wants to be in this picture
shes gotta be on that boat
she doesnt wanna
be in this picture
maureen pulled out
she pulled out
yesterday i told you
you said we were shooting
in singapore right
thats what you told her
yeah but were not
shooting in singapore
god damn it preston all you had to do
was look her in the eye and lie
i got to get to a phone
talk to harlows people
shes unavailable
myrna loy clara bow mae west
youll never get her
into a size four
you gotta get a girl thatll fit
into maureens costumes
fays a size four

a picture with rko
cooper huh
i might have known
youre not listening we
got to delay the shoot
shut production down
we cant sail tonight
not an option carl
i said id find a girl
for gods sake preston
think like a winner
call jack i need
that goddamn screenplay
defeat is always momentary
what
hey you gonna pay for this
excuse me
maam i think you dropped this
vaudeville huh
i worked vaudeville once
that is a tough audience
if you dont kill them
fast they kill you
mr denham
i want you to know
that im not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers
or for that matter
taking things that dont
belong to me
it was obviously a terrible
misunderstanding
its just that i havent
been paid in a while
thats awful anyway ann
may i call you ann
you wouldnt happen to be
a size four by any chance
no no oh god no
youve got me all wrong
miss darrow please
im not that type
of person at all
what type of person are you
im someone you can trust ann
im a movie producer
believe me i am on the level no
funny business please sit down
please please
okay
ann i want you to imagine
a handsome explorer
bound for the far east
youre filming in the far east
singapore
on board ship he meets
a mysterious girl
shes beautiful
shes fragile haunted
and she cant escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back
its as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment
this fateful meeting
that changes everything
and sure enough against her
better judgment
she falls in love
yes
but she doesnt trust it
shes not even sure
if she believes in love
uh
really
if she loves someone
its doomed
why is that
good things never
last mr denham
so youre interested good
thats settled then
now i dont wanna rush you
but we are under some time pressure
well i really ann
im telling you

but you dont look
at all like your photograph
excuse me wait a minute ann
hes so much younger in person
and much betterlooking

that you might be
one of those selfobsessed
literary types
im sorry im not
you know
the tweedy twerp with his nose
in his book and his head up his a
its nice to meet you
too miss darrow
good christ
shes standing at the railing
she doesnt know it yet
but they are sailing towards disaster
you got that
okay so she turns
the first mate
is staggering towards her
theres a knife sticking
out of his back
wait a sec were killing
off the first mate
thats assuming she knows
who the first mate is
come on jack it
was an honest mistake
ann is nearsighted it could
have happened to anyone
i was joking carl
the point is shes horrified
she has to look away
and thats when she sees it
sees what
what
the island
were filming on an island now
when did this happen
jack keep your voice down
i dont want the crew
getting spooked
why would they get spooked
whats it called
all right it has
a local name
but im warning you jack
it doesnt sound good
they call it skull island
did you get that
whats wrong with this place
theres nothing
officially wrong with it
because technically it
hasnt been discovered yet
okay all right
so we arrive at this place
s
k
u
i
i
island
all right everyone from the top
and action
i think this is awfully exciting
ive never been on a ship before
and ive never
been on one with a woman before
i guess you dont think much
of women on ships do you
no theyre a nuisance
well ill try not to be
just being around is trouble
cut
its great
bruce wonderful performance
you can relax for 10 minutes
that was very natural
i felt moved
what do you think driscoll
dialogues got some flow now huh
it was pure effluence
i beefed up the banter
try to resist that impulse
its just a little bit
of humor bud
what are you a bolshevik
or something
actors
travel the world but all they ever
see is a mirror
good legs
sea legs well you
know sea legs
yeah
not that you dont have good legs
just making conversation
jesus miss darrow
about the scene today
with you and bruce
i know it wasnt
what you wrote
but mr baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman
he must ignore her
and if things turn
really hostile then
no
interesting theory
i know i should have
it wasnt what i had
intended but
im sorry i was
and you made it your own
i was nervous
it was funny actually
you were funny
please dont say another word
good night
miss darrow
you dont have to be nervous
thank you
lets take it
would you please were
trying to shoot a scene
okay thank you
okay again
were close turn southwest
theres no land southwest
for thousands of miles
it takes us way
outside the shipping lanes
i wont sail blind
in these waters
ill make it worth your while
theres nothing out there
well then
youve nothing to lose
if someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for singapore
what would you say
i would say theyre
full of it mr hayes
well we turned
southwest last night
gentlemen please
were not looking for trouble
no
youre looking
for something else
yes we are
were going to find
skull island
find it film it
and show it to the world
for 25 cents you get to see
the last blank space on the map
i wouldnt be so sure of that
what do you mean
seven years ago me and mr hayes
were working our passage
on a norwegian bark
we picked up a castaway
we found him in the water
hed been drifting for days
his ship had run aground
on an island way west of sumatra
an island hidden in fog
he spoke of a huge wall
built so long ago
no one knew whod made it
a wall 100 foot high
as strong today
as it was ages ago
whyd they build the wall
well the castaway
he spoke of a creature
neither beast nor man
but something monstrous
living behind that wall
a lion or a tiger
a maneater thats how all these
stories start
what else did he say
nothing
we found him the next morning
hed stuck a knife through his heart
mmmhmm
sorry fellows youll have
to do better than that
monsters belong in b movies
if you find this place
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras
you wont come back
just as long as you
understand that
how long do you expect
us to stay out here
youre writing a stage comedy
im writing it for you
why would you do that
why would i write a play for you
yes
isnt it obvious
not to me
well
its in the subtext
i guess i must have missed it
its not about words
message for you captain
whats going on
hayes why
are we changing course
englehorn you cant just
outside
theres a warrant
out for your arrest
did you know that
ive been ordered
to divert to rangoon
another week i havent
got a film yet
please i have risked
everything i have on this
no denham you risked
everything i have
what do you want
tell me what you want
ill give you anything
i want you off my ship
set a course
for rangoon mr hayes
im finished
its over for me jack
howd you think this
would end carl
check our position
use the stars
there are no stars captain
what is that
what that
that right there
i dont know what is it
a coffee stain
station the forward lookout and get
me the depth by lead line
aye captain
30 fathoms no bottom
reduce speed steerage way only
dead slow ahead both
you should stop the ship
15 degrees port
were getting
out of here mr hayes

i dont give a damn
about carl denham
i want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide
come on move it
were leaving mr hayes
can you believe this jack
weve got our picture
why does marlow keep
going up the river
why doesnt he turn back
theres a part of him
that wants to jimmy
a part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning
but theres another part
that needs to know
to defeat the thing
which makes him afraid
we could not understand
because we were too far
and could not remember
because we were traveling
in the night of first ages
of those ages that are gone
leaving hardly a sign
and no memories
we are accustomed to look
upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster
but there
there you could look at a thing
monstrous and free
its not an adventure story
is it mr hayes
no jimmy
its not
its deserted of
course its deserted
use your eyes preston
the place is a ruin
nobodys lived here
for hundreds of years
mr denham i think
we should go back
i will handle this
look chocolate
you like chocolate
its good to eat
you want
take it
here put it in your hand
and take it
for gods sakes denham
leave the native alone
she doesnt want the chocolate

no woman is worth this

i dont care what it takes

oh really
shes not gonna buy
this for a second
shut up and hand
me the grapefruit
youre writing a comedy
yes i am
im writing it for you
why would you do that
why would i write
a play for you
isnt it obvious
oh im sorry
i couldnt help but overhear
so he took me to this
fancy french restaurant
and halfway through the hors
doeuvres he clutches my hand
and thats when he told
you how he felt
no he never said it
he never said it
he probably thought
he didnt need to say it
well then how does
she know that its real
he said it was not about the words
oh please
if you feel it you say it
its really very simple
he said wed talk about it later
only there was no later
it never happened
thats how it ended
he just let you walk away
he didnt try to save it
i honestly believed things
might actually work out
which was really very
foolish
men oh theyll give
you the world
but they let the one thing
that truly matters
slip through their fingers
typical
theyre so busy being brave
they forget to use their brains
romance who needs it
thank you
thank you
thank you
thank you
ladies and gentlemen
im here to tell you
a very strange story
the story of our adventure
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths
their lives lost
in pursuit of a savage beast
a monstrous
aberration of nature
but even the meanest
brute can be tamed
yes ladies and gentlemen
as you will see
the beast was no match
for the charms of a girl
a girl from new york
who melted his heart
bringing to mind that old
arabian proverb
and lo the beast looked
upon the face of beauty
and beauty stayed his hand
and from that day forward
he was as one dead
and now ladies and gentlemen
im going to show you
the greatest thing your eyes
have ever beheld
he was a king in the world he knew
but he comes to you now a captive
ladies and gentlemen
i give you kong the eighth
wonder of the world
dont be alarmed
its perfectly safe
these chains are made
of chrome steel
observe if you will
i am touching the beast
i am actually laying my hand
on the 25foot gorilla
crank em up fellas
and now we have
in the auditorium tonight
a surprise guest
the reallife hero
of this story
the man who hunted
down the mighty kong
the man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female
a big hand for mr bruce baxter
thank you thank you
thank you
he was right
about there still being
some mystery left in this world
and we can all have
a piece of it
for the price
of an admission ticket
thats the thing you come
to learn about carl
his unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves
please remain calm
ladies and gentlemen
for we now come to the climax
of this savage ritual
the sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl
behold her terror as she is offered
up to the mighty kong
a big hand folks for the bravest
girl ive ever met
miss ann darrow
save me from the beast
help me
where is she
wheres ann i have no idea
i heard he offered her all kinds
of money and she turned him down flat
pack up all my cares and woe
here i go
singing low
bye bye
blackbird
where somebody waits for me
sugars sweet
so is he
bye bye
blackbird

her from the beast

listen up
this is new york city
and this is sacred ground
you hear me
it was built
for humans by humans
not for stinking
liceinfested apes
the thought
of some mutant gorilla
crapping all over the streets of this
fair city fills me with disgust
so this is how its gonna be
we find it we kill it
we cut its ugly head
off and we ram it up
