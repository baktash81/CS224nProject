ever since you were small 
people been letting you down 
you gotta think of yourself now 
you should try
out for that part 
oh  i know what you re thinking 
every time you reach
out for something you care about   
fate comes
along and snatches it away 
but not this time  annie 
not this time 
oh  hello  mr  weston  oh  jeez 
look  miss  i told you
already  call my office 
leave your résumé
with my secretary 
now  why would i want to do that when
we can talk about it in person 
because that s what a smart
girl would do 
but i already sent you my résumé 
you returned it unopened 
what can i say  jack driscoll s very
particular about who he works with 
please  just an audition 
that s all i m asking 
jesus  you don t
give up  do you 
mr  weston  i know
this role backwards 
well  that s too bad   cause we just
gave the part to someone else 
i m sorry  kid 
the play is cast 
i know times are tough 
you want my advice 
use what you got 
you re not bad looking 
a girl like you doesn t
have to starve 
there s a new place 
it just opened 
now listen  princess  this gig
ain t the palace  you understand 
ask for kenny k 
tell him i sent you 
just play the date 
take the money   
forget you was ever there 
how much more is there 
another five reels 
lights up 
this is it 
this is what we get
for our  40 000  denham 
another one of your safari
pictures 
you promised us romantic scenes
with bruce baxter and maureen mckenzie 
come on  fellows 
you know the deal 
we agreed to push
maureen s start date   
so she could get
her teeth fixed 
it s not the principle
of the thing  it s the money 
carl  you ve been in production
for over two months 
trust me  bruce and maureen
are gonna steam up the screen   
once we get them on the ship 
what ship 
the one that we hired
to get to the location 
what location  carl  you re supposed
to be shooting on the back lot 
yes  i understand that 
but  fellows  we re not
making that film anymore   
and i ll tell you why 
the story has changed  the
script has been rewritten 
life intervened 
i ve come into possession
of a map 
the sole surviving record
of an uncharted island 
a place that was thought
to exist only in myth 
until now 
whoa  carl  slow down 
is he asking for more money 
he s asking us to fund
a wild goose chase 
i m talking about a primitive
world never before seen by man 
the ruins of an entire
civilization 
the most spectacular
thing you ve ever seen 
that s where
i ll shoot my picture 
will there be boobies 
boobies 
jigglies  jiblonkas  bazooms 
in my experience  people
only go to these films   
to observe the undraped
form of the native girls 
what are you  an idiot 
you think they asked de mille
if he would waste his time on nudie shots 
no  they respected the filmmaker 
they showed some class 
not that you d know
what that means  you cheap lowlife 
would you step
out for a moment  carl 
zelman and associates 
give me that  quick 
you won t like it 
it s non alcoholic 
preston  you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business 
don t write him off  fellows 
he s hotheaded  sure   
but carl denham s made
some interesting pictures 
he s had a lot of near success 
he s a preening self promoter 
an ambitious no talent  the guy s got
 loser  written all over him 
i understand
your disappointment   
  he can t direct  he  
  doesn t have the smarts   
  he s washed up   
  it s all over town   
this jumped up
little turd s gonna bankrupt us 
the animal footage has value 
sure  universal are desperate
for stock footage 
then sell it  scrap the picture 
we got to retrieve something
from this debacle 
get him back in 
mr  denham 
i want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour 
no  carl  you can t do this 
tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure 
it s not ethical  what
are they gonna do  sue me 
they can get in line 
i m not gonna let
them kill my film 
you realize that none of the camera
equipment is on board 
we have no permits  no visas 
that s why i have you  preston 
we have no insurance  we have
no foreign currency 
in fact  we have no
currency of any kind 
he s there 
get in there  who s gonna
pay for the ship 
get in 
you get out of there  come here 
step on it  step on it 
get out  you re
finished  denham 
don t worry  preston  i ve had
a lot of practice at this 
i m real good at crapping
the crappers 
red label  80  proof   
to be packed in a crate
marked  lemonade  
you got it 
tell maureen she doesn t have
six hours to put on her face 
if she wants to be in this picture 
she s gotta be on that boat 
she doesn t wanna
be in this picture 
maureen pulled out 
she pulled out 
yesterday  i told you 
you said we were shooting
in singapore  right 
that s what you told her 
yeah  but we re not
shooting in singapore 
god damn it  preston  all you had to do
was look her in the eye and lie 
i got to get to a phone 
talk to harlow s people 
she s unavailable 
myrna loy  clara bow  mae west 
you ll never get her
into a size four 
you gotta get a girl that ll fit
into maureen s costumes 
fay s a size four 
yes  she is  but she s doing
a picture with rko 
cooper  huh 
i might have known 
you re not listening  we
got to delay the shoot 
shut production down 
we can t sail tonight 
not an option  carl 
i said i d find a girl 
for god s sake  preston 
think like a winner 
call jack  i need
that goddamn screenplay 
defeat is always momentary 
what 
hey  you gonna pay for this 
excuse me 
ma am  i think you dropped this 
vaudeville  huh 
i worked vaudeville once 
that is a tough audience 
if you don t kill them
fast  they kill you 
mr  denham   
i want you to know   
that i m not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers 
or  for that matter   
taking things that don t
belong to me 
it was obviously a terrible
misunderstanding 
it s just that i haven t
been paid in a while 
that s awful  anyway  ann   
may i call you ann 
you wouldn t happen to be
a size four  by any chance 
no  no  oh  god  no 
you ve got me all wrong 
miss darrow  please 
i m not that type
of person at all 
what type of person are you 
i m someone you can trust  ann 
i m a movie producer 
believe me  i am on the level  no
funny business  please sit down 
please  please 
okay 
ann  i want you to imagine   
a handsome explorer
bound for the far east 
you re filming in the far east 
singapore 
on board ship  he meets
a mysterious girl 
she s beautiful 
she s fragile  haunted 
and she can t escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control   
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back 
it s as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment   
this fateful meeting
that changes everything 
and sure enough  against her
better judgment   
she falls in love 
yes 
but she doesn t trust it 
she s not even sure
if she believes in love 
uh   
really 
if she loves someone 
it s doomed 
why is that 
good things never
last  mr  denham 
so you re interested  good 
that s settled  then 
now  i don t wanna rush you 
but we are under some time pressure 
well  i really    ann 
i m telling you   
you re perfect  look at you 
you re the saddest
girl i ve ever met 
you re gonna make them weep  ann 
you re gonna break their hearts

wrong  mr  denham

that s what i do 
good luck with your picture

of a lifetime  and a long sea voyage

familiar with your work

i ve read everything
you ve ever written 
no  too much

all over the dialogue 
seagulls 
camera noise  wind 
christ knows what else 
i don t care  mike

delighted to meet you  ma am 
likewise

oh  this old thing 
i just threw it on

that one of maureen s costumes 
now  what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast 
lumpy  you heard the lady 
fancy my porridge à la walnuts 
oh  ann  i don t
believe you ve met   
ann 
that s all right  mr  denham 
i know who this is 
thrilled to meet you  it s an honor
to be a part of this 
gee  thanks 
actually  i m quite
familiar with your work 
really 
yes  and what i most admire   
is the way you ve captured
the voice of the common people 
well  that s my job 
i m sure you ve heard this
before  mr  driscoll   
if you don t mind me saying   
but you don t look
at all like your photograph 
excuse me  wait a minute  ann   
he s so much younger in person 
and much better looking 
ann  stop  stop right there 
you see  i was just afraid
that you might be   
one of those self obsessed
literary types 
i m sorry  i m not   
you know   
the tweedy twerp with his nose
in his book and his head up his a   
it s nice to meet you 
too  miss darrow 
good christ 
she s standing at the railing 
she doesn t know it yet   
but they are sailing towards disaster 
you got that 
okay  so she turns   
the first mate
is staggering towards her 
there s a knife sticking
out of his back 
wait a sec  we re killing
off the first mate 
that s assuming she knows
who the first mate is 
come on  jack  it
was an honest mistake 
ann is nearsighted  it could
have happened to anyone 
i was joking  carl 
the point is  she s horrified 
she has to look away 
and that s when she sees it 
sees what 
what 
the island 
we re filming on an island now 
when did this happen 
jack  keep your voice down 
i don t want the crew
getting spooked 
why would they get spooked 
what s it called 
all right  it has
a local name   
but i m warning you  jack 
it doesn t sound good 
they call it skull island 
did you get that 
what s wrong with this place 
there s nothing
officially wrong with it 
because  technically  it
hasn t been discovered yet 
okay  all right 
so we arrive at this place 
s   
k   
u   
i   
i   
island 
all right  everyone  from the top 
and action 
i think this is awfully exciting 
i ve never been on a ship before 
and i ve never
been on one with a woman before 
i guess you don t think much
of women on ships  do you 
no  they re a nuisance 
well  i ll try not to be 
just being around is trouble 
cut 
it s great 
bruce  wonderful performance 
you can relax for 10 minutes 
that was very natural 
i felt moved 
what do you think  driscoll 
dialogue s got some flow now  huh 
it was pure effluence 
i beefed up the banter 
try to resist that impulse 
it s just a little bit
of humor  bud 
what are you  a bolshevik
or something 
actors 
travel the world  but all they ever
see is a mirror 
good legs 
sea legs  well  you
know  sea legs 
yeah 
not that you don t have good legs 
just making conversation 
jesus  miss darrow 
about the scene today
with you and bruce   
i know it wasn t
what you wrote   
but mr  baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman   
he must ignore her 
and if things turn
really hostile  then   
no 
interesting theory 
i know  i should have   
it wasn t what i had
intended  but   
i m sorry  i was   
and you made it your own 
i was nervous 
it was funny  actually 
you were funny 
please don t say another word 
good night 
miss darrow 
you don t have to be nervous 
thank you 
let s take it   
would you please    we re
trying to shoot a scene 
okay  thank you 
okay  again 
we re close  turn southwest 
there s no land southwest
for thousands of miles 
it takes us way
outside the shipping lanes 
i won t sail blind
in these waters 
i ll make it worth your while 
there s nothing out there 
well  then
you ve nothing to lose 
if someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for singapore   
what would you say 
i would say they re
full of it  mr  hayes 
well  we turned
southwest last night 
gentlemen  please 
we re not looking for trouble 
no 
you re looking
for something else 
yes  we are 
we re going to find
skull island 
find it  film it 
and show it to the world 
for 25 cents  you get to see
the last blank space on the map 
i wouldn t be so sure of that 
what do you mean 
seven years ago  me and mr  hayes
were working our passage   
on a norwegian bark 
we picked up a castaway 
we found him in the water 
he d been drifting for days 
his ship had run aground
on an island way west of sumatra 
an island hidden in fog 
he spoke of a huge wall   
built so long ago   
no one knew who d made it 
a wall 100 foot high   
as strong today
as it was ages ago 
why d they build the wall 
well  the castaway 
he spoke of a creature   
neither beast nor man   
but something monstrous 
living behind that wall 
a lion or a tiger 
a man eater  that s how all these
stories start 
what else did he say 
nothing 
we found him the next morning 
he d stuck a knife through his heart 
mmm hmm 
sorry  fellows  you ll have
to do better than that 
monsters belong in b movies 
if you find this place   
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras   
you won t come back 
just as long as you
understand that 
how long do you expect
us to stay out here 
you re writing a stage comedy 
i m writing it for you 
why would you do that 
why would i write a play for you 
yes 
isn t it obvious 
not to me 
well   
it s in the subtext 
i guess i must have missed it 
it s not about words 
message for you  captain 
what s going on 
hayes  why
are we changing course 
englehorn  you can t just   
outside

about carl denham 
i want this ship fixed and ready

can you believe this  jack 
we ve got our picture 
why does marlow keep
going up the river 
why doesn t he turn back 
there s a part of him
that wants to  jimmy 
a part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning 
but there s another part   
that needs to know 
to defeat the thing
which makes him afraid 
 we could not understand
because we were too far    
 and could not remember    
 because we were traveling
in the night of first ages    
 of those ages that are gone    
 leaving hardly a sign 
and no memories  
 we are accustomed to look    
 upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster    
 but there   
 there you could look at a thing
monstrous and free    
it s not an adventure story   
is it  mr  hayes

a play for you 
isn t it obvious 
oh  i m sorry 
i couldn t help but overhear 
so  he took me to this
fancy french restaurant   
and halfway through the hors
d oeuvres  he clutches my hand 
and that s when he told
you how he felt 
no  he never said it 
he never said it 
he probably thought
he didn t need to say it 
well  then how does
she know that it s real 
he said it was not about the words 
oh  please 
if you feel it  you say it 
it s really very simple 
he said we d talk about it later 
only there was no later 
it never happened 
that s how it ended 
he just let you walk away 
he didn t try to save it 
i honestly believed things
might actually work out   
which was really very   
foolish 
men  oh  they ll give
you the world   
but they let the one thing
that truly matters   
slip through their fingers 
typical 
they re so busy being brave 
they forget to use their brains 
romance  who needs it 
thank you 
thank you 
thank you 
thank you 
ladies and gentlemen   
i m here to tell you
a very strange story 
the story of our adventure   
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths   
their lives lost   
in pursuit of a savage beast   
a monstrous
aberration of nature 
but even the meanest
brute can be tamed 
yes  ladies and gentlemen 
as you will see   
the beast was no match   
for the charms of a girl 
a girl from new york   
who melted his heart   
bringing to mind that old
arabian proverb   
 and lo  the beast looked
upon the face of beauty    
 and beauty stayed his hand  
 and from that day forward 
he was as one dead  
and now  ladies and gentlemen 
i m going to show you   
the greatest thing your eyes
have ever beheld 
he was a king in the world he knew 
but he comes to you now a captive 
ladies and gentlemen   
i give you kong  the eighth
wonder of the world 
don t be alarmed 
it s perfectly safe 
these chains are made
of chrome steel 
observe  if you will   
i am touching the beast 
i am actually laying my hand
on the 25 foot gorilla 
crank  em up  fellas 
and now  we have
in the auditorium tonight   
a surprise guest 
the real life hero
of this story 
the man who hunted
down the mighty kong 
the man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female 
a big hand for mr  bruce baxter 
thank you  thank you 
thank you 
he was right 
about there still being
some mystery left in this world   
and we can all have
a piece of it   
for the price
of an admission ticket 
that s the thing you come
to learn about carl 
his unfailing ability
to destroy the things he loves 
please remain calm 
ladies and gentlemen   
for we now come to the climax
of this savage ritual 
the sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl 
behold her terror as she is offered
up to the mighty kong 
a big hand  folks  for the bravest
girl i ve ever met 
miss ann darrow 
save me from the beast 
help me 
where is she 
where s ann  i have no idea 
i heard he offered her all kinds
of money and she turned him down flat 
  pack up all my cares and woe  
  here i go  
  singing low  
  bye bye  
  blackbird  
  where somebody waits for me  
  sugar s sweet  
  so is he

for humans  by humans

lice infested apes 
the thought
of some mutant gorilla   
crapping all over the streets of this
fair city  fills me with disgust
