i m sure we can convince one of the
girls from bunk 10 to boink mckinley 
they re really horny this summer 
where did he go  anyway 
  i don t know 
  probably went to write his mommy
and daddy a letter    what a fag 
  who are we gonna set him up with 
  how about debbie 
  no  she s got mono 
  right

  who 
  you know  debbie debbie

get mckinley laid 
as everybody knows 
today is the big culminating 
climactic softball game   
  against evil camp tiger claw 
  boo 
we have put together
an unlikely   
team of misfits  and we ve been
training like crazy all summer 
yeah  it s a motley crew
that you d think   
would never be able
to win a single game 
we had a kooky training period
where it seemed like   
it seemed like nothing was
gonna go right  but  guys 
somehow we made it
to the finals 
so i say  when those anonymously
evil campers from tiger claw get here 
we give it our best shot  and we try to
come from behind at the last minute   
with some weird trick play that we
made up and we win the game 
what do you say  team 
it sounds like
well worn territory 
the whole thing feels kind of
trite  i say we forget it 
  is that how everybody feels 
  yeah 
well  it s fine with me 
so listen  they just
aren t into it  it s kind of trite 
yeah  you re right  no problem  man 
it s sort of hackneyed  tried
and done before 
see you later  man 
it s no big deal 
they were totally cool 
okay  all right 
susie is gonna score
with mckinley 
then he s gonna need some
eyewitnesses for verification 
let s go 
why does she still
have her clothes on 
  looks like she s playing the flute 
  oh  wow  kinky 
as bared witness
by myself 
all of camp firewood and the higher
power  however you define it 
i hereby consecrate
and sanctify the union   
of mckinley and ben 
may their majestic
and blessed love   
flourish all the days
of their lives 
  amen 
  amen

outcast  loose cannon  
maybe  i don t think so 
i want to introduce you guys

i put it to you  camp firewood 
as we spend our last dinner together

time or the place to discuss it 
beth  meet me at the picnic table in
ten seconds  i ll tell you all about it 
okay 
beth  hello  thanks for coming 
let s get right to it 
you may recall ten seconds ago  i asked
you to join me here by the picnic table   
so i could tell you what s going on 
well  earlier today  i saw what i
thought was possibly a planet 
also possibly a meteor
in the evening sky 
i now believe that object
was none other   
than a renegade piece of skylab 
the nasa space station 
  and it s heading right for the camp 
  oh  my god 
and there s more  we have
no way of pinpointing exactly
where it s going to land 
  it could kill us all 
  jesus 
wait a minute  there
might be a way   
to build a homemade
skylab tracking device 
  which accomplishes    we could
surmise the location of impact 
we could avert a tragedy on
the scale of the hindenburg 
  beth  will you help us 
  anything you need 
let s do it 
hey  andy 
  can i talk to you for a second 
  sure 
  okay  well   
  time s up 
you said a second 
  i want to ask you something    so you
want to talk for more than a second 
  yeah 
  what is it then  like a couple minutes 
  no  yeah  at most  say  like
three minutes    fine 
  do you really love katie 
  not really 
because i really
love her  man 
and if you have one ounce of decency 
you will do the right thing and let her go 
  no way 
  no way 
fuck no  dude  she s hot 
in fact  fuck off 
i will not fuck off 
you re making a really
big mistake  buddy 
because that woman
is not your plaything 
coop  seriously   
fuck off 
  i m sick of talking about this with you 
  god 
whoa 
so this is the skylab
tracking device 
is this gonna save
my camp 
i don t know  but if it does 
we ll all be heroes 
in fact  i just got word
that if we pull this off 
i could be up for the hopkins
prize for physics 
the hopkins  baby  what a dream 
you ll finally get your tenure 
be proud of who you are 
huh 
  gene

no  my friend 
jimmy s  in there

  no 
  what 
well  there might be a way that
we could use our device   
to slightly change
its direction  but   
no  it s impossible 
why  what s the problem 
in order to do it  we would
somehow have to be able   
to repeatedly generate random
numbers between one and twenty   
in order to calibrate
the deferential 
that would take some sort of
super mainframe computer
and we don t have one 
so all is lost

any dungeon master
worth his weight in geldings   
goes nowhere without his   
20 sided die

i almost like it better
that way 
it was us rolling the dice

i feel like this entire summer 
which kind of sucked 
has been rejuvenated by the
events of the past 24 hours 
yeah  it s like   
well  forget it 
  you know what 
  what 
you guys are my best friends 
well  my only friends

  so  this is it  babe 
  yep 
so  obviously i think we should get
together in the city next weekend 
  i ll call my parents  and you can
talk to your dad and kim    listen 
last night was really great  you were
incredibly romantic and heroic 
no doubt about it 
and that s great 
but i ve thought about it 
and my thing is this 
andy s really hot  and don t
get me wrong  you re cute too 
but andy is like cut from
marble  he s gorgeous 
he s like this beautiful face
and this incredible body 
and i genuinely don t care
that he s kind of lame 
i don t even care
that he cheats on me 
and i like you more than
i like andy  coop  but i m 16 
and maybe it will be a different story
like when i m ready to get married 
but right now  i m entirely
about sex  i just want andy 
  yeah 
  i wanna take him 
and grab him and just fuck
his brains out  you know 
so that s where my
priorities are right now 
sex  specifically with andy
and not with you 
but you re really nice 
everybody thinks so 
and i m sorry if this isn t the direction
you saw things going between us 
i still totally want
to be friends 
you better write me
a letter  okay
