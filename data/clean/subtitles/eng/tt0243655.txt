climactic softball game
against evil camp tiger claw
boo
we have put together
an unlikely
team of misfits and weve been
training like crazy all summer
yeah its a motley crew
that youd think
would never be able
to win a single game
we had a kooky training period
where it seemed like
it seemed like nothing was
gonna go right but guys
somehow we made it
to the finals
so i say when those anonymously
evil campers from tiger claw get here
we give it our best shot and we try to
come from behind at the last minute
with some weird trick play that we
made up and we win the game
what do you say team
it sounds like
wellworn territory
the whole thing feels kind of
trite i say we forget it
is that how everybody feels
yeah
well its fine with me
so listen they just
arent into it its kind of trite
yeah youre right no problem man
its sort of hackneyed tried
and done before
see you later man
its no big deal
they were totally cool
okay all right
susie is gonna score
with mckinley

eyewitnesses for verification

what is the point  this isnt the
time or the place to discuss it
beth meet me at the picnic table in
ten seconds ill tell you all about it
okay
beth hello thanks for coming
lets get right to it
you may recall ten seconds ago i asked
you to join me here by the picnic table
so i could tell you whats going on
well earlier today i saw what i
thought was possibly a planet
also possibly a meteor
in the evening sky
i now believe that object
was none other
than a renegade piece of skylab
the nasa space station
and its heading right for the camp
oh my god
and theres more we have
no way of pinpointing exactly
where its going to land
it could kill us all
jesus
wait a minute there
might be a way
to build a homemade
skylab tracking device
which accomplishes  we could
surmise the location of impact
we could avert a tragedy on
the scale of the hindenburg
beth will you help us
anything you need
lets do it
hey andy
can i talk to you for a second
sure
okay well
times up
you said a second
i want to ask you something  so you
want to talk for more than a second
yeah
what is it then like a couple minutes
no yeah at most say like
three minutes  fine
do you really love katie
not really
because i really
love her man
and if you have one ounce of decency
you will do the right thing and let her go
no way
no way
fuck no dude shes hot
in fact fuck off
i will not fuck off
youre making a really
big mistake buddy
because that woman
is not your plaything
coop seriously
fuck off
im sick of talking about this with you
god
whoa
so this is the skylab
tracking device
is this gonna save
my camp
i dont know but if it does
well all be heroes
in fact i just got word
that if we pull this off
i could be up for the hopkins
prize for physics
the hopkins baby what a dream
youll finally get your tenure
be proud of who you are
huh
gene
shh
it isnt about the girl
it isnt
well it is
but see if you
can follow me here

you are ready to be taught
the new way

into the fire
taking it higher and higher
nothing to fear
its only desire
taking it higher and higher

what
well there might be a way that
we could use our device
to slightly change
its direction but
no its impossible
why whats the problem
in order to do it we would
somehow have to be able
to repeatedly generate random
numbers between one and twenty
in order to calibrate
the deferential
that would take some sort of
super mainframe computer
and we dont have one
so all is lost
no its not
any dungeon master
