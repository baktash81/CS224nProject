mrs moore returns on the rawalpindi

the viceroy s on board

   military band plays 
 cheering

not to be here to meet us 
  it is nearly a thousand miles 
  we ve come 5 000 miles to meet him 
 no more than two annas each  
thank you  thank you 
now    victoria station 
 knocking 
  oh  dear 
  don t worry 
  mrs moore 
  yes 
i m mrs turton 
my husband s the collector 
oh    we gave our tickets
to the indian gentleman 
the chief administrator of chandrapore 
ronny s  burra sahib

please forgive us  mrs turton 
we ve had a very trying day 
we just wanted to welcome you
to the fold and to say    we re off 
we must have a drink or something later 
when you ve recovered  goodbye 
i believe you and ronny met
in the lake district  miss quested 
  yes  we did 
  you must forgive me 
we have very few secrets in chandrapore 
and i m an incurable romantic 
miss quested was with her aunt
and i was with ronny 
you know  mrs moore  ronny s
doing splendidly  you ll be proud of him 
i ll second that 
he s become a proper sahib 
just the type we want  if i might say so 
 train rumbles 
you know  mr turton 
when we get settled in 
we look forward to meeting some of
the indians you come across socially
as friends 
well  as a matter of fact 
we don t come across them socially 
they re full of all the virtues 
no doubt  but we don t 
east is east  mrs moore 
it s a question of culture 
could ronny really have become a sahib 
he could 
but that s why you ve come here 
you ll find out soon enough 
she s a dreadful woman 
yes 
we d better go to sleep  my dear 
 coughing 
hello  mother  where s adela

i can t believe it 
antony 
 speaks urdu 
antony will see to the baggage  forgive

guards  attention 
sorry to desert you  we had to
welcome the great man back 
  i d no idea he was so important 
  you hadn t 
 car horn 
 car horn 
 hoots repeatedly 
look out 
 car horn 
  that was turton 
  turton 
 car horn 
mcbryde  when he first came  hamidullah
said he was quite a good fellow 
but they all become exactly the same 
i give any englishman two years 
  the women are worse 
  i give them six months 
ronny  is that a body 
yes  i m sorry 
we ll soon be out of this 
why do we spend so much time
discussing the english 
because we admire them  doctor sahib 
that is the trouble 
tomorrow night 
english 
  here we are  then 
  very nice  dear 
  are those the marabar hills 
  that s right 
  with the caves 
  i suppose so 
look  you ve got a busy day tomorrow 
then we have a show at the club 
  come on  let s have tea 
  yes 
 ronny  good night  mother 
   knocking 
  yes 
  good night  dear 
  good night 
having listened to the evidence 
i find you guilty of cheating
under section 415
of the indian penal code
and sentence you
to two months  hard labour 
you may take the prisoner down 
  well  how did it all go 
  we must have seen everything 
yes  the church  the hospital 
the war memorial  the barracks 
  mr hadley was most thorough 
  splendid  and now you re off to the club 
cucumber 
my dear  life rarely gives us what we want
at the moment we consider appropriate 
adventures do occur 
but not punctually 
doctor sahib  when are we
going to get you married 
i have enough responsibilities  auntie 
we ask the poor fellow to dinner 
avail ourselves of his professional skills 
  and you always bring up this question 
  it is the least i can do 
this should put a stop to the trouble 
and  begum sahiba  i beg you once more
not to drink water out of a tap 
please to boil it  boil it  boil it 
and now we can eat  selim 
 both speak urdu 
why must you always bring up
this question of marriage 
he sends the children nearly all his salary
and lives like a low grade clerk 
what more do you require 
this chitty has just arrived for you
from major callendar 
i am to report to his bungalow posthaste 
and my bicycle has a puncture 
the major sahib left half an hour ago 
  and left no message 
  no message 
mrs lesley  it is a tonga  come 
oh  how splendid 
i suppose this is all right 
my dear  never look a gift horse in
the mouth  particularly in this country 
club 
club  tonga wallah  club 
why doesn t the fool move 
i pay you tomorrow 
 women giggle 
will you please   
 rustling 
 leaves rustling 
madam  this is a mosque 
you have no right here 
  you should have taken off your shoes 
  but i have taken off my shoes 
i left them outside 
then i    i ask your pardon 
  let me go 
  madam 
i am right  am i not 
if i remove my shoes  i am allowed 
of course 
but so few ladies take the trouble 
especially if thinking
no one is here to see 
god is here 
god is here 
that is very fine 
may i know your name 
mrs moore 
oh 
i came from the club 
they re doing a rather tiresome
musical play i d seen in london 
  it was very hot 
  i think you ought not to walk alone 
there are bad characters about 
and leopards may come from the hills 
  snakes also 
  but you walk alone 
  i come here quite often  i m used to it 
  used to snakes 
i m a doctor  you see 
snakes don t dare bite me 
please 
mrs moore  i think you are
newly arrived in india 
yes  how did you know 
by the way you address me 
look 
sometimes i have seen a dead body
float past from benares 
but not very often 
  there are crocodiles 
  crocodiles 
how terrible 
what a terrible river 
what a wonderful river 
please may i ask you a question now 
why do you come to india 
i come to visit my son 
he s the city magistrate 
oh  no  excuse me 
our city magistrate is mr heaslop 
he is my son all the same 
i was married twice 
and your first husband died 
he did  and so did my second 
then we are in the same box 
and is the city magistrate
the entire of your family now 
no  i have a daughter in england by my
second husband  stella  she s an artist 
ah 
mrs moore  like yourself 
i have also a son and a daughter 
is not this the same box
with a vengeance 
but not called ronny and stella  surely 
no indeed  akbar and jamila 
they live with my wife s mother 
and your wife 
in giving me a son  she died 
you have the most kind face
of any english lady i have met 
i think i d better go back now 
  i ve got this strange feeling
i ve fallen in love
    she s fallen in love 
    while i was freewheeling
and   
  hooray  hooray  hooray
  it s a wonderful day today
  but i know that at this juncture
  i can t afford a puncture
  and here is my michael   
i wish i were a member 
i could have asked you in 
indians are not allowed 
oh 
good night 
there you are 
what have you been up to 
i ll tell you about it later 
i had a small adventure 
and saw the moon in the ganges 
ah  mrs moore  miss quested 
have a drink  have two drinks 
  it s very kind 
  my wife s on stage 
and ronny s still holding
the fort for major callendar 
his wretched indian assistant didn t
turn up in time  but i got my own back 
i m sorry about the show 
but what else can we do for you ladies 
mr turton  i m longing to see
something of the real india 
fielding  how is one to see the real india 
try seeing indians 
  who was that 
  our schoolmaster  government college 
as if one could avoid seeing them 
well  i ve scarcely spoken to
an indian since we landed 
lucky you 
if you really want to meet
some of our aryan brothers 
how about a bridge party 
  not the game 
  oh   
no  a party to bridge the gulf
between east and west 
we can produce almost any type you like 
hindus  muslims  sikhs  even a parsee 
 drum roll 
  god save our gracious king
  long live our noble king
  god save the king
  send him victorious
  happy and glorious   
   band plays  tea for two  
to work  molly  to work 
i never thought so many would turn up 
they hate it as much as we do 
ronny 
 speaks urdu 
very nice of you to come 
would you please tell these ladies
i wish we could speak their language 
  perhaps we speak yours a little 
  why  fancy  she understands 
  piccadilly  hyde park corner 
  yes  indeed 
  rotten row 
  marble arch 
  she knows paris also 
  they pass paris on the way  no doubt 
    roses of picardy  
my only consolation
is that mrs turton will soon be retired
to a villa in tunbridge wells 
who is that man talking to adela 
oh  that s fielding 
runs government college 
i don t understand people inviting guests
and not treating them properly 
you and mr turton are the only people
who ve made any attempt to be friendly 
it makes me quite ashamed 
it s awkward  i agree  here at the club 
i envy you being with indians 
if you and mrs moore would care
to meet one or two  it s easily arranged 
i d love to  i m sure she would too 
we ve an old hindu professor who ll tell
you all about reincarnation and destiny 
  he might even be persuaded to sing 
  i d like that 
  tell me  do you know a dr aziz 
  i know of him  i ve never actually met 
mrs moore says he s charming 
  good  we ll invite him too 
  good 
oh  dear  this is for mrs turton 
    in a monastery garden 
by albert ket√®lbey 
this is one of the most unnatural affairs
i have ever attended 
of course it s unnatural 
now you see 
i do not see why you all behave
so unpleasantly to these people 
  we re not out here to be pleasant 
  ronny  what do you mean 
india isn t a drawing room  we re out here
to do justice and to keep the peace 
i m not a missionary
or a sentimental socialist 
  i m just a member of the civil service 
  as simple as that 
what do you and adela want me to do 
sacrifice my career 
lose the power i have
for doing good in this country 
good  you re speaking about power 
the whole of this entertainment
is an exercise in power 
and the subtle pleasures
of personal superiority 
   band plays  god save the king  
god has put us on earth
to love and help our fellow men 
yes  mother 
mr fielding 
 water running 
  mr fielding 
  oh  hello  is that dr aziz 
yes  i m afraid i am early 
that s fine  i won t be a jiffy 
please make yourself at home 
may i really  mr fielding 
it s very good of you 
  mr fielding 
  yes 
i have long been wanting to meet you 
i have heard many times about
your kind heart and your sociability 
my dear fellow 
and i have seen you in the bazaar 
ah 
 fielding hums  the sun  whose rays
are all ablaze  by gilbert   sullivan 
  the sun  whose rays are all ablaze
with ever living glory
  does not deny his majesty 
he scorns to tell a story   
  i say  mr fielding 
  yes 
before you come out 
guess what i look like 
well  let s see 
you re about 5ft 9in tall 
  jolly good 
  i can see that much through the glass 
blast 
  anything wrong 
  i ve just broken my back collar stud 
oh  take mine 
have you a spare one 
yes  yes  one minute 
  not if you re wearing it 
  no  no  here in my pocket 
but nobody carries
a spare stud in his pocket 
i always  in case of emergency 
here it is 
many thanks 
oh  and how do you do 
sit down while i finish dressing 
if you don t mind the unconventionality 
i always thought englishmen
kept their rooms so tidy 
everything arranged coldly
on shelves is what i thought 
there are two english ladies
coming to tea to meet you 
  oh 
  oh  i think you know one of them 
  i know no english ladies 
  not mrs moore 
  mrs moore 
  and miss quested  her companion 
oh  is she an old lady 
she s a young lady 
and she wants to see india 
 both speak urdu 
they re here 
or will be in a few seconds 
i ve also asked our professor
of philosophy  narayan godbole 
oh  the inscrutable brahmin 
i hope to goodness his food ll be
all right  he s orthodox  you know 
 fielding  good afternoon  welcome 
   mrs moore  how kind of you to ask us 
   miss quested  nice to meet you 
oh 
it must have been a small audience hall 
mrs moore  do you remember
the tank in our mosque 
  i do indeed 
  please come and see 
by a skilful arrangement of our emperors 
the same water comes and fills this tank 
my ancestors loved water 
we came out of the desert 
we came over from
persia and afghanistan 
and wherever we went  we created
fountains and gardens and   
ah  godbole  you know dr aziz 
and here are our new visitors 
mrs moore  miss quested  professor
godbole  we didn t realise you were here 
the sun will soon be driving us
all into the shade 
and i was enjoying the water 
now  mrs moore  would you like
to have our tea served inside or out 
dr aziz  i wonder if you could explain
a disappointment we had this morning 
ah  yes  i m afraid we may have
given some offence 
that is impossible  may i know the facts 
yes  an indian lady and gentleman  whom
we met at the club party the other day 
were to collect us in their carriage
this morning at nine 
we waited and waited 
they never came 
they even put off
going to delhi to entertain us 
  i wouldn t worry about it 
  well  it is very worrying 
i think perhaps  young lady 
they grew ashamed of their house
  and that is why they did not send 
  that s very possible 
  i do so hate mysteries 
  we english do 
i rather like mysteries 
but i do dislike muddles 
i think a mystery is only
a high sounding term for a muddle 
the professor  aziz and i
know that india s a muddle 
agreed  i m sorry to say 
there will be no muddle
when you come to visit me at my house 
that would be very nice  yes  adela 
yes  indeed  do please give me
your address  doctor aziz 
  yes 
  one moment  i have a better idea 
let me invite you all
to a picnic at the marabar caves 
ladies  this will be
a most magnificent outing 
one is transported by mountain railway
2 000 feet above the plain 
and the caves  mrs moore 
are a wonder of india 
  yes  professor 
  they have a reputation 
doctor  how many caves are there 
i m not exactly sure  unfortunately 
i ve never been there myself 
my dear chap 
professor godbole 
have you seen the caves 
oh  yes 
well  could you tell us
something about them 
with pleasure 
only a few have been opened 
perhaps seven or eight 
and 
there is an entrance which you enter 
and through this entrance  manmade 
there is a circular chamber 
  big 
  not big 
  immensely holy  no doubt 
  oh  no  no 
ornamented in some way 
they are all the same  empty and dark 
well  there must be something
to account for their reputation 
indeed 
well  well 
mr fielding  i should like
to see something of the college 
don t you come  adela 
i know you hate institutions 
you know  miss quested  when i first
saw mrs moore it was in the moonlight 
i thought she was a ghost 
  a very old soul 
  an old soul 
the professor is using
the expression in its hindu sense 
someone who has been here
many times before 
  mrs moore   a reincarnation 
  quite so 
  please go on  professor 
  ah  yes 
  it is philosophy of some complication 
  but in simple terms   
in simple terms  miss quested 
life is a wheel with many spokes 
a continuous cycle of life 
birth  death and rebirth
until we attain nirvana 
i have contrived a dance
based on this philosophy 
do you dance  professor 
  adela 
  oh  ronny  you re early 
let me introduce to you
professor godbole and this   
what s happened to fielding 
and what on earth are you doing 
they re seeing the college and
we re eating water chestnuts  have one 
no  thank you  we re leaving at once 
  but we can t leave like this 
  it s perfectly all right 
bearer  bearer 
 train whistle 
you can take it from me
that picnic will never come off 
just like that fiasco this morning 
he ll forget he invited you 
  you re wrong 
  notice the collar climbing up his neck 
i like dr aziz 
aziz was dressed in his sunday best 
but he d forgotten his back collar stud 
and there you have the indian all over 
i bet he forgot the caves
are miles from the station 
  have you been to them 
  i know all about them  naturally 
  naturally 
  i really cannot have this quarrelling 
sorry 
i don t know why i get so het up 
actually  i was taking us all
to see a game of polo  should be good 
not for me  dear  i m going to rest 
you and adela can watch the polo 
  ronny 
  yes 
  i want to say something 
  yes 
something important 
ronny   
i ve finally decided   
we re not going to be married 
you never said we would be married 
but you were quite right to come out 
it was a good idea 
we re being awfully english
about this  aren t we 
i suppose that s all right 
as we are english  yes  i suppose it is 
let s go for a little drive 
  oughtn t we get back to the bungalow 
  why 
i think we should tell your mother 
talk about what we re going to do 
if you don t mind 
let s leave it a day or two 
i don t want to upset her
any more than i have 
and besides 
you re going on that expedition 
and why did you undertake
such an extravagance 
to avoid asking them to my house 
which you had already done 
now we must all put
our shoulders to the wheel 
my wife will supply plates 
knives and forks 
and then there is the question of alcohol 
whisky sodas for mr fielding 
ports for the ladies 
and food  the english are big eaters 
  and professor godbole 
  he eats more than the english 
  nothing but vegetables  fruits and rice 
  and only if cooked by a brahmin 
and if there is a slice of beef
in the vicinity  he will throw up 
the english can eat mutton 
  even ham 
  ham  are you suggesting i offer ham 
enough  enough 
english ladies cannot sit upon the ground 
not even on a persian carpet 
  you must take chairs and tables 
  so you will need servants 
then there is also the question
of transport after the train journey 
the caves are a considerable
distance from the station 
i ve just been to the station 
the train leaves before dawn 
then you must take precaution
against lack of punctuality 
better spend the night there 
  what was that 
  nothing 
it always happens before the hot weather 
generally with dust and thunder  coffee 
no  thank you  i m off to bed 
i know i made myself
rather ridiculous this afternoon 
but the truth is  i wasn t
quite sure of myself  and i m sorry 
very nicely said  thank you  dear 
of course  i have no earthly right to tell
either of you what you can or cannot do 
see india if you like and as you like 
sometimes i think too much fuss
is made about marriage 
century after century
of carnal embracement 
and we re still no nearer
understanding one another 
good night 
 dogs barking 
 bicycle bell 
adela  are you all right 
yes  of course 
  well  what happened 
  nothing 
i want to take back what i said at the polo 
oh  ronny    i m such a fool 
   orchestra plays  oh  lady be good  
it s a funny thing 
but i don t feel a bit excited 
well  nothing s really changed  has it 
i feel perfectly ordinary 
it s much the best feeling to have 
i suppose so 
i m sorry to have been so difficult 
oh  i shouldn t worry 
it s partly to do with this country
and the odd surroundings 
do you mean that my bothers
are to do with india 
india forces one to come
face to face with oneself 
it can be rather disturbing 
odd 
it must be very cold in england 
now we must go back
and you must dance with ronny 
apart from anything else 
it will serve as a notice of intent 
hello 
 rumble of thunder 
 groans 
hassan 
 both speak urdu 
  it s going to be hot 
  your famous hot weather 
  mother 
  you two go ahead 
ah 
congratulations 
we ve just heard the good news 
allow me to shake your hand 
mr fielding  i m dr lal 
  ah  yes  how do you do 
  just making check on doctor sahib 
  major callendar s orders 
  and 
a slight fever  perhaps 
change of season 
  you must get well quickly 
  yes  there is talk of cholera in the city 
there is always talk of cholera in the city 
hello  can i come in 
mr fielding  yes  please come in 
ah 
  hamidullah 
  mr fielding  how nice of you to come 
  and how s the patient 
  it is very good of mr fielding
to condescend to visit our friend 
we re deeply touched 
don t talk to him like that 
he does not want it 
and he does not need three chairs 
he s not three englishmen 
well  are you ill or aren t you 
no doubt major callendar
told you i m shamming 
well  are you 
the hot weather is coming 
i have a fever 
sit down  sit down 
sit down  all of you 
mr fielding  excuse  a question  please 
  carry on 
  nothing personal 
personally  we re all delighted
that you should be here 
but how is england
justified in holding india 
  unfair political question 
  no  no 
  i m out here because i need a job 
  qualified indians also need a job 
i got in first 
and i m delighted to be here  that s
my answer and that s my only excuse 
  and those who are not delighted 
  chuck  em out 
indians are also saying that 
   speaks urdu 
  mr fielding   
what are you doing out here 
please come back 
of course 
here you see the celebrated
hospitality of the east 
look    look at the mess 
look at the flies 
  look at the plaster coming off the wall 
  oh  please 
here is my home 
where you come to be insulted
by my friends 
that was fair enough 
and you d better get back into bed 
  and then you ll have to be off 
  you should rest 
i can rest all day thanks to dr lal 
major callendar s spy 
i suppose you know that 
major callendar doesn t trust anyone 
english or indian  that s his character 
i wish you weren t under him 
but you are  and that s that 
there we are  try sleeping for a bit 
before you go  will you please open
that drawer under the clock 
there s a grey cardboard folder 
that s right  open it 
she was my wife 
you are the first englishman
she has ever come before 
now put her away 
i don t know why you pay me this
great compliment  but i do appreciate it 
oh  it is nothing  she was not a highly
educated woman  or even beautiful 
but i loved her 
now put her away 
you would have seen her anyhow 
  would you have allowed me to see her 
  why not 
i believe in the purdah  but i would
have told her you were my brother 
  would she have believed you 
  of course not 
put her away  she is dead 
i showed her to you because
i have nothing else to show 
mr fielding  why are you not married 
the lady i liked wouldn t marry me 
that s the main point 
that was a long time ago 
before the war 
  you haven t any children 
  none 
excuse the following question 
have you any illegitimate children 
no 
  then your name will die entirely out 
  right 
this is what an oriental
will never understand 
  there are far too many children anyway 
  why don t you marry miss quested 
  good lord 
  but she s very nice 
i can t marry her even if i wanted to 
she s engaged to the city magistrate 
oh 
so no miss quested for mr fielding 
however  she is not beautiful 
and she has practically no breasts 
for a magistrate they may be sufficient 
for you i ll arrange a lady
with breasts like bombay mangoes 
no  you won t 
you must not tell callendar  but last year
i took sick leave and i went to calcutta 
  there are girls there with breasts   
  you ve made a remarkable recovery 
  i have  i have 
  please tell your chap to bring my horse 
  he doesn t seem to understand my urdu 
  i told him not to 
but now i will release you  hassan 
 both speak urdu 
by the way  about this marabar
expedition  it s going to cost an awful lot 
would you like me to help you call it off 
no  no  arrangements
are almost complete 
i shall know exact date tomorrow 
well  good  don t leave it too long 
phew 
hassan 
 both speak urdu 
 train whistle 
you ve come after all  i was afraid   
how kind  how very kind 
i m sorry  dr aziz  but i ve never been
at my best at this time of the morning 
  we re here anyway 
  yes  excuse me  please come 
 speaks urdu 
  this isn t all for us 
  for this great occasion
i ve had help from all my friends

antony   
i don t like him at all 
antony  you can go now 
we won t need you any more 
master told me to stay 
mistress tells you to go

you make me quite giddy 
poor aziz 
we must try and get hold of a car 
can you think of anyone 
is anything the matter 
  you saw the gates shut against us 
  yes 
  today is tuesday 
  go on 
not a wise day
to undertake such a journey 
extremely inauspicious  mr fielding 
godbole 
i wouldn t have missed this for anything 
  memsahib 
  oh  thank you 
  tea coming 
  yes 
what a relief after antony 
rather a strange place to do the cooking 
i always feel rather embarrassed
when people i dislike are good to me 
and i really don t care for mrs callendar 
but she s visiting a clinic and
the road goes up to just below the caves 
we d better leave in half an hour 
would you care for a coffee 
  miss quested 
  oh  no 
is mrs moore awake 
yes  but please    go in 
don t worry  miss quested 
look  i am douglas fairbanks 
tell me  dear  what s going on out there 
mrs moore  we re almost there 
i will now explain to you about the ladder 
it is to be your big surprise 
you cannot imagine how you honour me 
i feel that i am journeying back into
my past  and that i m a mogul emperor 
sometimes i shut my eyes and dream   
i have splendid clothes again 
and that i m riding into battle
behind alamgir  he too rode an elephant 
horrid  stuffy place  really 
  everything is very well arranged 
  and here  ladies  is your port
