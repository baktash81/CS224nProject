words said in friendship with
the best of intentions
always winding up hurting
your friends deeply
and then you wind up getting hurt
is friendship always that way
if thats so whats left
if i were you
who needs friends like that
a courageous choice in itself
are you 0k

at first they look
like the other dots
what are they
i dont know

karasawasan
i need you to check this

my friend kawashima
huh
the grad student yoshizakisan
hello
i forgot to give you my number
0h right
call me 0k
right
anytime 0k
yeah
thank you
everyone dies therefore theres no
logical reason for ghost s not to exist
how many ghosts have
existed s ince prehistoric times
do you see it too
who is that
you ll have to catch him
to find out
start right now
and you might succeed
have a go
what
why dont you right now
he disappeared
i see
he must be a student
i dont know him
maybe you re right
sorry i encouraged you
see you
wait a minute
just what was that
im cold
the spirit
or consciousness the soul
whatever you want to call it
it turns out the realm they
inhabit has a finite capacity
whether that capac ity
accommodates billions or trillions
eventually it will run out of space
0nce its filled to the brim
its got to overf low
somehow somewhere
but where
the soul s have no choice
but to ooze into another realm
that is to say our world
maybe at first
it started with something
really simple
0nce that realm
reached critical mass
any device would have sufficed
thrown it together with
the means and materials at hand
thats how i see it
excuse me do you have any tape
anythingll do some tape
hows this
thank you
after many hours or days
or many weeks
it finally happens
through that process
it spreads around the world
but now they re no longer
the faint presence they began as
you saw one yoursel f
i dont believe your stories
right sorry its all hypothetical
thanks for the tea
are you 0k
just fine
but if this really happened
theres no turning back
no mat ter how simple the device
and become permanent
in other words
hello
0h i see our boss isnt there
yes i understand
if he does stop by
will you please
ask him to call us
yes thank you very much
michi
what do you thinks going on
whys everyone disappearing
