words said in friendship with
the best of intentions
always winding up hurting
your friends deeply
and then you wind up getting hurt
is friendship always that way 
if that s so  what s left 
if i were you     
who needs friends like that
a courageous choice in itself
are you 0k 
did something happen 
both junco and i 
are really worried

a face     
what 
a horrible face     
i  ve never seen anything like it     
what are you saying 
what did you see 
the forbidden room
forbidden room 
what s that 
is that     
the room with the red tape 
don t dare go in there  
please

i  m cold
yabe

exit
harue

phantoms
you reading this 
yeah
is it related to your
work in the lab 
yeah
huh     
do you have a minute 
what  sure
come
isn t it strange 
yeah      sort of     
almost like ghosts  right 
you re right  they re like ghosts

at first  they look
like the other dots
what are they 
i don t know

oh  what happened with that 
nothing      yet

karasawasan
i need you to check this
yes

my friend  kawashima
huh     
the grad student  yoshizakisan
hello
i forgot to give you my number
0h  right
call me  0k 
right
anytime  0k 
yeah
thank you
 everyone dies  therefore there s no
logical reason for ghost s not to exist 
 how many ghosts have      
 existed s ince prehistoric times       
do you see it too 
who is that 
you  ll have to catch him
to find out
start right now 
and you might succeed
have a go 
what 
why don t you  right now
he disappeared
i see
he must be a student     
i don t know him
maybe you  re right
sorry i encouraged you
see you
wait a minute
just what was that 
i m cold     
the spirit     
or consciousness  the soul 
whatever you want to call it 
it turns out the realm they
inhabit has a finite capacity
whether that capac ity
accommodates billions or trillions 
eventually  it will run out of space
0nce it s filled to the brim 
it s got to overf low
somehow  somewhere
but where 
the soul s have no choice
but to ooze into another realm 
that is to say  our world
maybe  at first     
it started with something
really simple
0nce that realm
reached critical mass 
any device would have sufficed
thrown it together with
the means and materials at hand
that s how i see it
excuse me  do you have any tape 
anything ll do  some tape
how s this 
thank you
after many hours or days 
or many weeks 
it finally happens
through that process 
it spreads around the world
but now they  re no longer
the faint presence they began as
you saw one yoursel f
i don t believe your stories
right  sorry  it s all hypothetical
thanks for the tea
are you 0k 
just fine
but if this really happened 
there s no turning back
no mat ter how simple the device 
and become permanent
in other words 
hello
0h  i see  our boss isn t there 
yes  i understand
if he does stop by 
will you please
ask him to call us 
yes  thank you very much
michi 
what do you think s going on 
why s everyone disappearing 
oh  hello  this is
sunny plant sales calling
