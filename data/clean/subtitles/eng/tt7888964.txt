like they all do
and i usually pulled the trigger before the waterworks began

and wanted nothing more
than to shed his wolf skin
and return to the pasture
as a lamb
i quietly let alan go
a year later
i went back to check on him
fully expecting to find him
back unto the fold
alan was living in boise idaho
he had a wife
she came with two kids
they had another on the way
they had a dog
he was working 900 to 500
nothing there to skim
and he was smiling
laughing
like a goddamn buddha

i wanted what alan had
so i told my bosses

i mean if this doesnt
make us even
because after all
you came to my house
which you know
you dont fucking do
you killed my brother
the last i saw
he was still breathing
and based on what little
i know of the man
thats probably more
than he deserved
now
you can come after me
and if you succeed
in taking me down
well youre still obligated
to refinance the entire obshak
which begs the question
can you
do you even want to
cause ive heard
that you want out
what better time than right now
lets both quit
right you got a nest egg
i mean besides from whats
still smoldering
so hmm
get some work done
maybe uh open a tiki bar
in one of the lesserknown
caribbean islands
and live your life
far from me and mine
