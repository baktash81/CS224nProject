am i really now
that predictable 
from where i sit  mr  mansell 
everyone is 
short story long 
he s as bad as they come 
a connected  funded sociopath
with resources
to make things complicated 
so  he s a bad guy 
 has he got any hobbies 
 collects art 
to the tune of eight
and nine figures 
anything good 
fuck if i know 
but what i do know is 
if he doesn t know
who you are yet 
he will soon 
what have you got for me 
i found his dad 
he s got him at
a nursing home downtown 
that s not much 
i wouldn t worry
about this hutch guy 
your man here looks to be
as vanilla as they come 
if you can t recognize a wolf
in sheep s clothing 
i question the viability
of your employment here 
i have a friend at the pentagon 
i ll keep looking 
one blackmail package coming up 
what the fuck

of a loose end like you

of the russian mob 
that s hundreds of millions
of dollars in cash
perpetually on the move 
and yulian is
the current babysitter

a couple of chapters back  um 
there was this guy named alan 
aaron 
no  it was alan 
alan skimmed
about three million bucks
from a u s  military base
in rivolto  italy 
and his prize was me
looming over him
with a walther ppk 
no  wait 
uh  it was a suppressed
h k usp  45
at the back of his head 
and he started begging 
like they all do 
and i usually pulled the trigger before the waterworks began 
but this time i listened 
 sighs  i heard a man who genuinely regretted his choices
and wanted nothing more
than to shed his wolf skin
and return to the pasture
as a lamb 
i quietly let alan go 
a year later 
i went back to check on him 
fully expecting to find him
back unto the fold 
alan was living in boise  idaho 
he had a wife 
she came with two kids 
they had another on the way 
they had a dog 
he was working 9 00 to 5 00 
nothing there to skim 
and he was smiling 
 laughing  
like a goddamn buddha 
that motherfucker 
i am not a jealous guy 
but in that moment 
i wanted what alan had 
so i told my bosses
i was out of the game 
they were not happy to hear it 
they didn t believe
i could do it 
  song ends

oh  i came for the show 
cute 
 laughter 
you have some nerve
to be here like this 
yeah  maybe 
  guns cocking 
  patrons gasping  murmuring 
what say you and i
have a moment 
now  on the one hand 
there s a long dormant
piece of me now awake
that wants so very badly
to play this out 
the other 
more reasonable piece of me  
what s left of it  
would like to end our little
tête à tête right now 
what s done is done 
after all 
we can both rebuild  right 
right 
mm  wait  rebuild 
i burned it   all of it 
what all 
everything you have 
had 
everything you had 
my art 
  bangs table 
 obshak 
you should ve seen it go up 
 chuckles 
it was something 
i mean  if this doesn t
make us even  
because  after all 
you came to my house 
which you know
you don t fucking do 
you killed my brother 
the last i saw 
he was still breathing 
and based on what little
i know of the man 
that s probably more
than he deserved 
now   
you can come after me 
and if you succeed
in taking me down 
well  you re still obligated
to refinance the entire obshak 
which begs the question  
can you 
do you even want to 
 cause i ve heard
that you want out 
what better time than right now 
let s both quit 
right  you got a nest egg 
i mean  besides from what s
still smoldering 
so  hmm 
get some work done 
maybe  uh  open a tiki bar
in one of the lesser known
caribbean islands
and live your life
far from me and mine 
think it over 
i ll be nearby
