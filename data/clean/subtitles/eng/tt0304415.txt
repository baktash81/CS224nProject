in the art history department   
   she pursued it single mindedly
until she was hired 
it was whispered
that katherine watson   
   a first year teacher
from oakland state   
   made up in brains
what she lacked in pedigree 
which was why this bohemian
from california   
    was on her way to the most
conservative college in the nation 
 excuse me  please 
 oh   sorry 
excuse me 
excuse me  the bus 
 keep walking  ma am 
 thank you 
but katherine watson didn t come
to wellesley to fit in 
she came to wellesley because
she wanted to make a difference 
 violet

or hi fi after 8 on weekdays   
   10 on weekends   
   no hot plates and no male visitors

without a hot plate 
don t you just love chintz 
and look 
they match 
sweet  right  your room s here 
my room is just across the way   
   and amanda armstrong s
down the other end 
 you grew up here 
 my whole life 
you ll meet my parents
when they come to visit 
 they visit 
 regularly 
 what do you teach 
 speech  elocution and poise 
dinners are communal 
so i ll handle that 
but breakfast and lunch 
you re on your own  so   
   we each get our own shelf 
i ll make your label this evening 
i don t need to tell you  everything on
our individual shelves is sacrosanct 
i just knew when we met   
   we d be instant friends 
be careful  they can smell fear 
 good morning 
 good morning 
thank you

we ll be following
dr  staunton s syllabus

 connie baker 
 katherine watson  nice to meet you 
 dr  watson  i presume

 giselle levy 
giselle  if someone could get the  
 susan delacorte 
 thank you  susan delacorte 
from the beginning  man has always
had the impulse to create art 
 can anyone tell me what this is 
 wounded bison  altamira  spain   
   about 15 000 b c 
joan brandwyn 
very good  joan 
despite the age of these  they are
technically sophisticated because  
the shading and the thickness of the
lines moving over the bison s hump 
 ls that right 
 yes  that s exactly right 
next slide 
this is probably less familiar 
it was discovered by archeologists  
in 1879  lascaux  france 
dates back to 10 000 b c 
singled out because of flowing lines
depicting the movement of the animal 
 lmpressive  name 
 herd of horses 
 i meant yours 
 we call her flicka 
elizabeth warren 
they call me betty 
very good 
betty is also correct 
just because something is ancient
doesn t mean that it is primitive 
for example  next slide  please 
mycerinus and his queen  2 470 b c 
it s a funerary statue
of the pharaoh and queen   
   originally intended to preserve
the pharaoh s ka  soul 
have any of you taken
art history before 
no 
let s go on  slide 
seated scribe  egypt  2 400 b c 
peasant couple plowing 
sixteenth century b c  egypt 
snake goddess 
minoan  1 600 b c 
fresco  minoan  1 600 b c 
funeral mask  mycenaean  1 200 
could someone please get   
thank you 
by a show of hands only   
   how many of you have read
the entire text 
 and the suggested supplements 
 long way from oakland state 
well  you girls do prepare 
if you ve nothing else for us 
we could go to independent study 
ac  
i was in california once  how do you
get work done with all that sunshine 
 we tan in class 
 really 
no 
you know  not everybody
wanted you 
i m not naming any names 
these jobs usually go quickly 
ex students  friends of  you know   
   the right people 
the person they wanted took a job at
brown  and no one else was available 
so here you are 
you can go in now  good luck 
your first class left a lot
to be desired  miss watson 
and i m curious about the subject
of your dissertation 
you suggest   picasso will do
for the 20th century   
   what michelangelo did
for the renaissance    unquote 
in terms of influencing movements 
so these canvases that
they re turning out these days   
   with paint dripped
and splotched on them   
   they re as worthy of our attention
as michelangelo s sistine chapel 
i m not comparing them 
have you ever seen
the sistine chapel  miss watson 
actually stood there 
i ve never been to europe 
i can assure all of you this is the place
i want to be more than anything 
better discipline next class 
miss watson 
 hello 
 it s me 
 hey 
 collect from katherine watson 
 will you accept 
 yeah  sure  of course i will 
hey  is everything okay 
yeah 
tough  huh 
well  how are the classes 
snobs  right 
 i hate to say i told you so 
 you don t have to 
i can t really talk right now 
i ll write you tonight 
so you got a fella 
he s   he s there  i m here 
long distance  torture  i know 
come  come in and sit down 
when lenny left for the south pacific 
it nearly broke my heart 
we wrote every day until    
he was a great man 
 i m sorry 
 lt was a hundred years ago 
i m babbling 
i love lucy 
even if she is a communist 
the only thing red about lucy
is her hair 
and even that s fake  desi said it 
winchell wrote it 
amanda armstrong 
i see you survived 
katherine watson  just barely 
oh  good  you ve met 
katherine s taken the third bedroom 
how about a little dinner
before what s my line 
how about a little drink 
her companion died in may 
companion 
you know  companion 
josephine burns 
taught biology here for 30 years 
you ll love it here  katherine 
you ll see 
i already do  i   honestly 
it s beautiful  it s perfect  really 
well  don t fool yourself  they have
claws underneath their white gloves 
who 
the alumnae  their offspring 
the faculty  you name it 
watch out for yourself 
too much independence
frightens them 
 will you please stop 
 oh  a word of advice 
don t let those girls
know that they got to you 
 they didn t 
 good for you 
you almost convinced me 
 what is that 
 you tell me 
carcass by soutine  1 925 
 it s not on the syllabus 
 no  it s not 
is it any good 
come on  ladies 
there s no wrong answer 
there s also no textbook
telling you what to think 
it s not that easy  is it 
all right  no  it s not good 
in fact  i wouldn t even call it art 
it s grotesque 
is there a rule against
grotesque art 
i think there s something
aggressive about it   
    and erotic 
 to you  everything is erotic 
 everything is erotic 
 girls 
 aren t there standards 
 of course 
otherwise a tacky velvet painting
could be equated to a rembrandt 
my uncle ferdie has two tacky velvet
paintings  he loves those clowns 
there are standards  technique 
composition  color  even subject 
so if you re suggesting
that rotted side of meat is art   
   much less good art 
then what are we going to learn 
just that 
you have outlined our new syllabus 
betty  thank you 
what is art 
what makes it good or bad 
and who decides 
next slide  please 
twenty five years ago someone
thought this was brilliant 
 i can see that 
 who 
my mother  i painted it
for her birthday 
next slide  this is my mom 
 ls it art 
 it s a snapshot 
if i told you ansel adams had taken it 
would that make a difference 
 art isn t art until someone says it is 
 it s art 
 the right people 
 who are they 
betty warren 
 we re lucky we have one right here 
 screw you 
could you go back
to the soutine  please 
just look at it again 
look beyond the paint 
let us try to open our minds
to a new idea 
all right  back to chapter three 
has anyone read it 
okay

 i think she s fabulous 
 well  no man wanted her 
 she isn t dead

 oh  no  no 
 i guess she never wanted children 
for your information   
   katherine watson had to take
this job to escape from california 
please 
she had a torrid affair
with a hollywood movie star 
 she came here to get away 
 that s ridiculous 
 who was it 
 i don t know

 tell me  no  it s not  you know 
 you know something  tell me

william holden 
i know  i know  i m late  i m   abject
pleading  apologies  forgiveness

come on  out  i m going
to lock the door  out 
bedtime  ladies  bedtime 
let s go  bedtime 
 hey  betty 
 quiet time  ladies 
women like katherine watson
don t get married   
    because they choose not to 
 no woman chooses to live   
   without a home  unless she s
sleeping with her ltalian professor 
 you are so critical 
 i am not 
of course you are 
you re your mother s daughter 
it s a classic electra complex 
i don t blame you  i mean   
   who wouldn t want
to murder your mother 
 hey  how s the harvard sweetheart 
 divine 
got an extra ciggie 
 did you do his homework 
 of course

 no 
this isn t what i think it is  is it 
where d you get it 
from the school nurse 
 it s against the law 
 oh  honey  it s a girl s best friend 
 a certain kind of girl 
 meet the last virgin bride 
 spencer is a gentleman 
 and even gentlemen have dicks 
 maybe i ll get one 
 what  a dick 
don t be stupid  connie 
someone  somewhere 
someday might be interested 
just in case 
just in case  i ll be prepared 
was that necessary 
i was taught it s best
to speak honestly 
okay  you re a bitch 
we recently learned
that amanda armstrong   
   our nurse  has been distributing
contraception to wellesley girls 
this revelation is disturbing
to an institution   
    that prides itself on propriety 
go  go  go  go  go 
it s been going on since the late  80s 
 whoever wins is first to marry 
 do the girls take it literally 
only the girl with the winning hoop 
oh  look  it s phyllis nayor 
good for her  it gets me every time 
 why the buggies 
 they ve got their man 
they re wishing for their babies 
have you seen this 
what is it 
it s a front page attack on amanda
armstrong  betty warren wrote it 
 by providing contraception
on demand  our school nurse   
   is little more than a cheerleader
for promiscuity   wow 
oh  they re not going to dump her
in a lake 
 i m coming  phyllis 
 have you seen this 
i wouldn t worry  betty s just
a young girl flexing her muscles 
so was lizzie borden 
and her mother wasn t president   
    of the alumnae association 
 would somebody get that girl a towel 
 that s her mother 
 apple  tree 
is amanda going to get into trouble 
amanda needs to start
minding her p s and q s 
the trick to surviving wellesley
is never getting noticed 
ciao  mona lisa 
the big war hero 
he thinks he s something special 
he sleeps with his students 
the gold is fine 
the napkin rings are vulgar 
the glassware should be trimmed
with gold 
the little sugar boxes  gold and white 
filled with chocolate  no candlesticks 
 freesia instead of daisies 
 wise choice  madam 
no baby s breath 
 you already had your fitting 
 we re on our way 
here s the seating chart
and spencer s list of groomsmen 
oh  i almost forgot 
i spoke to him about reading the
poem  he d rather not  i said all right 
excuse us for a second  joan 
a good wife lets her husband
think that everything s his idea   
    even when it s not 
 i don t care if he reads it 
you will in retrospect 
now  why don t you see if you
can t nudge the idea into his head 
i ve been here now
for 21 years  jocelyn 
 i remember you as a student 
 twenty four  if you count that 
so why the theatrics 
we cannot appear
to promote sexual promiscuity 
okay  it s about appearances  then 
no 
all right  all right 
all right  well  i promise not to appear
to be sympathetic  progressive   
   or what did mrs  warren
call it   liberal  
scout s honor 
i spent the better part of friday
afternoon convincing the alumnae   
   that your record was impeccable   
   that you would no longer
provide contraceptive devices   
   and you d make
a public statement to that effect 
i m not willing to make
a public statement 
it doesn t matter  amanda 
they re letting you go 
it s out of my hands 
and this champagne cup
is in the wrong place 
and up and down  and up and  
katherine  good evening 
miss watson 
 good evening  miss watson 
 join us 
no 
 good night  miss watson 
 good night  miss watson 
and down  very nice  very nice 
hey 
heard about amanda  i m sorry 
she seemed all right about it 
i wouldn t be 
they don t give you
too many chances around here 
oh  that depends how much
they hate you to begin with 
can i buy you a drink 
or are you here for dinner 
how long do
the marriage lectures take 
get this woman a booth 
your husband is at a crossroads
in his career 
he s competing for promotion
against two rivals  smith and jones 
to get the edge  you have wisely
decided to invite the boss   
   and his wife to a 7 00 dinner 
you ve carefully planned
your meal   
   set your table
and arranged for a babysitter 
 oh  we have babies 
 yes  and i have twins 
then  surprise  it s 6 1 5   
   and your husband s called to say
that smith  jones and their wives   
   have been invited
at the boss s request 
ever the wellesley girl   
   you keep your cool
and understand   
   that the boss is probably testing you
as much as your husband  what next 
 yes 
 file for divorce 
that s very funny 
but the thing is  it s not a joke 
a few years from now
your sole responsibility   
   will be taking care
of your husband and children 
you may all be here   
   for an easy a   
   but the grade that matters the most
is the one he gives you  not me 
 you ll need to  
 whatever you do   
   don t put the boss s wife
next to your husband 
 why not 
 she s screwing him 
is that where you learned
to speak ltalian  in ltaly 
yeah 
 have you got a boyfriend 
 yes 
you know  if you were mine 
i d never let you go 
i wouldn t have asked
your permission 
yeah  they say you re progressive 
a forward thinker 
 are you 
 there are a lot of labels here   
   i ve noticed 
right family  right school  right art 
right way of thinking 
well  saves the effort
on thinking for yourself 
how do you expect to ever make
a difference if everything is a joke 
oh  katherine watson comes to
wellesley to set us all free  come on 
 thank you for the drink 
 no  no  wait  i was teasing 
they have their own way
of doing things here 
you ve just gotta find a way
to work with them  we all had to 
i m sorry 
five years ago 
they d have slapped my wrist 
but now there s a committee
for the protection of everything 
they think you re dangerous 
oh  no  darling  no  subversive 
it s gotten to the point   
   where you don t know
who is protecting whom from what 
or should that be  from whom  
well  whom gives a damn anyway 
they re doing me a favor really 
will you be all right 
better than that 
i should really have left
when josephine died 
nothing left to love
here anymore  so

she did me the favor  not you 
come on  dance with me 
she s too good for you 
maybe you re right

1 954 
sunflowers  vincent van gogh  1 888 
he painted what he felt 
not what he saw 
people didn t understand  to them 
it seemed childlike and crude 
it took years for them to recognize
his actual technique   
   to see the way his brush strokes
seemed to make the night sky move 
yet  he never sold a painting
in his lifetime 
this is his self portrait 
there s no camouflage  no romance 
honesty 
 now  60 years later  where is he 
 famous 
so famous  in fact 
that everybody has a reproduction 
 there are post cards  
 we have the calendar 
with the ability to reproduce art 
it is available to the masses 
no one needs to own
a van gogh original 
we do  in the newport house 
but it s small  tiny 
they can paint their own 
van gogh in a box  ladies 
the newest form
of mass distributed art 
paint by numbers 
 now everyone can be van gogh 
it s so easy 
just follow the simple instructions   
   and in minutes  you re on
your way to being an artist  
van gogh by numbers 
ironic  isn t it  look at what
we have done to the man   
   who refused to conform
his ideals to popular taste 
who refused to compromise
his integrity 
we have put him in a tiny box
and asked you to copy him 
so the choice is yours  ladies 
you can conform to what
other people expect or you can  
i know  be ourselves 
you re a sight for sore eyes 
i would ve been on time but  silly me 
i thought class was in the classroom 
glad you could join us  mrs  jones 
we thought we d lost you 
 there s an unwritten rule for marr  
 don t bother 
since your wedding  you ve missed
six classes  a paper and your midterm 
well  thank god i didn t miss
the paint by numbers lecture 
i was on my honeymoon
and then i had to set up house 
 what does she expect 
 attendance 
most of the faculty turn their heads   
   when the married students
miss a class or two 
then why not get married
as freshmen 
that way you could graduate without
actually ever stepping foot on campus 
don t disregard our traditions
just because you re subversive 
don t disrespect this class
just because you re married 
don t disrespect me
just because you re not 
come to class  do the work 
or i ll fail you 
if you fail me 
there will be consequences 
 are you threatening me 
 i m educating you 
that s my job 
miss watson 
miss watson 
what s this 
every year  the ars nominate a
member of the faculty to be our guest 
the what 
you ll see  come by tonight at 5 00 
adam s ribs  a very secret society 
wait here 
first  the oath 
please raise both hands 
do you swear not to repeat what
you see  hear or smell tonight 
 smell 
 keep your hands up 
yes  smell 
i do 
it ll only burn for a second 
go on 
and now that you ve taken the oath 
we get to ask you whatever we want 
 oh  is that how it works 
 and you have to answer 
who invited her 
you re in time
for truth or consequences 
i go first  why aren t you married 
well    
that s poisonous 
i m not married because   
   i m not 
i was engaged to patrick watts 
everybody called him leo 
and i never knew why 
he was the first person
that i ever danced with   
   or smoked with 
got incredibly drunk with and  
well  a lot of first things 
we were 1 8 and getting married 
christmas of  41 
then pearl harbor happened
and everything changed 
everybody changed 
and by june  he was sent overseas 
 did he come back 
 yes 
 was he changed 
 they both were 
i m sorry 
 your parents 
 yeah 
after the war   
   they didn t know each other
anymore  didn t like each other 
he left  he got a whole new family 
divorce 
what 
yeah  first on my block 
that s a city block 
people change  things happen 
it s the same with me and leo 
he went off and married
someone else 
 and i got to go to graduate school 
 ucla  right 
 which is in hollywood 
 it s close 
anyway  aren t you gonna tell
everybody about  you know   
    your big news 
 what are you talking about 
 she got engaged over christmas 
 congratulations 
i m sorry to blab 
it s just so romantic 
how fantastic 
we split up 
 what 
 we split up 
well  that was fast 
well  not every relationship
is meant for marriage 
 some are strictly affairs 
 bill dunbar 
he d be an affair  let s talk
about that  miss watson 
you don t believe in withholding 
do you 
no  i do  however  believe in manners 
but for you  i ll make an exception 
that s what we re supposed to do
for married students  right  betty 
professor dunbar and l
are not having an affair 
did you have one
with william holden 
 connie 
 she asked about bill dunbar 
 how did you hear that 
 oh  it is true 
betty  i told you 
 won t you regret never marrying 
 there s still time 
i guess i assume that i will
at some point 
 i m not gonna plan my life around it 
 neither should we 
 i didn t say that 
 you did to joan 
 that s what she told me 
 what are you saying 
she knew you and tommy
were getting engaged 
and she practically filled out
your application 
 i didn t say that 
 she s been accepted 
now she just has to figure out
a way to tell tommy 
why don t you do it  you re good
at butting into people s business 
funny  that s what they say
about you 
 spencer  do i look all right 
 yeah  fine 
 i don t have a lot of time  speed it up 
 mr  grouchy 
 all right  here we go again 
 all right  go ahead  louise 
married wellesley girls have become
quite adept at balancing obligations 
one hears such comments as 
 i baste the chicken with one hand
and outline the paper with the other   
while our mothers were called
to work for lady liberty   
   it is our duty  nay  obligation
to reclaim our place in the home   
   bearing the children that will carry
our traditions into the future 
one must pause to consider why
miss katherine watson   
   instructor in the art history
department   
   has decided to declare war
on the holy sacrament of marriage 
her subversive and political teachings
encourage our wellesley girls   
    to reject the roles
they were born to fill 
thank you 
slide 
 contemporary art 
 that s just an advertisement 
quiet 
t oday you just listen 
what will the future scholars see
when they study us 
a portrait of women today 
there you are  ladies 
the perfect likeness
of a wellesley graduate 
magna cum laude  doing exactly
what she was trained to do 
slide 
a rhodes scholar 
i wonder if she recites chaucer while
she presses her husband s shirts 
slide 
now  you physics majors can calculate
the mass and volume   
   of every meat loaf you make 
slide 
a girdle to set you free 
what does that mean 
what does that mean 
what does it mean 
i give up 
you win 
the smartest women in the country 
i didn t realize that
by demanding excellence   
   i would be challenging    
what did it say 
what did it say 
 the roles you were born to fill  
is that right 
the roles you were born to fill 
it s my mistake 
class dismissed 
these girls    
are you proud  president carr 
 yes  actually  i am 
 well  you should be  i guess 
half of them are married 
the other half  give it a month or so 
it s really only a matter of time 
they re biding time
until somebody proposes 
a hundred years ago  it was
inconceivable for a woman   
   to be a college graduate 
perhaps you should look back
to see how far we ve come 
i m sorry  from where i sit 
it s just a different kind of corset 
 well  we can all use a little support 
 oh  like amanda armstrong 
 she broke the law 
 according to betty warren 
according to the state
of massachusetts 
to hell with wellesley 
i m done 
goddamn it 
it s brilliant  really 
a perfect ruse 
a finishing school disguised
as a college  they got me 
 what do you expect 
 more  more 
i thought it was a place for
tomorrow s leaders  not their wives 
 calm down  please 
 no  i will not 
i ve got 1 0 more minutes 
meet me in my office  meet me 
 how you feeling 
 stupid  deceived 
really  really angry 
change takes time  you know 
you gotta let them catch up with you 
katherine  this place needs you 
i don t know how the hell they let
you in  but i m sure glad they did 
the things i said to president carr 
she ll never let me back in 
she s a pretty good egg 
what things 
don t worry 
time will heal it 
unless  of course  you want to go back
to california and that fiance of yours 
we re not engaged  thanks 
sorry i interrupted your class 
katherine 
i wanted to give you this 
it was for christmas  and    
then i met your man  so l    
the sistine chapel 
david 
venus de milo  and   
   mona lisa 
thank you 
this is gonna be
a three in one shot  ready 
you didn t even try 
this game is probably a no no
in the better homes and gardens 
not that i have ever been in the
better homes and gardens  have you 
no  no  i m just an old soldier 
they don t invite us 
what do they say about them though 
 old soldiers never die  we just  
 they just   
   become philandering
ltalian professors 
 that was below the belt 
 that was unkind 
deeply unkind 
you know  i don t know how i feel
about being a rebound 
 i ll leave 
 no  you don t have to do that 
i ll get used to it 
 what are you doing 
 getting dressed 
i had fun  and i m not looking
for anything serious 
why don t you come down here
and we can discuss it 
but as long as we re doing
whatever it is that we re doing  
which we did pretty well 
don t you think 
no students 
i m serious 
i don t want to teach a class wondering
why a girl is wearing my perfume 
 katherine  l  
 i need your word 
all right  you have my word 
 okay 
 now can we change the subject 
talk about something
a little more interesting 
like breakfast 
you know  i make
a mean blueberry pancake 
i just put that shoe on 
i don t think i know you
well enough for breakfast 
i don t know about that 
so how does a guy
get to know you better 
well  let me  
that s a good idea 
is that a battle wound you have 
i m a sucker for war stories
in romance languages 
 well  that s pretty easy 
 yeah 
i was in a village   called san remo   
   the krauts pounded us hard   
   me   stan   
   you remember stan  we were the
only two left from our platoon 
we heard a distant cry coming
from an abandoned shed 
when night fell   
a trap it was 
remember   
   invert your nouns and
your verbs 
 hungry 
 famished 
don t say we can live on love 
that s how i missed breakfast

oh  connie 
i don t keep track of his dates 
they ve been on again  off again

betty 
and we switch 
 wonder teacher 
 tommy

i mean  she will always have that 
thanks to you  miss watson 
you ve been real swell to her 
we both appreciate it 
i m sorry   the fact that she got in   
what does that mean 
well  she ll be in philadelphia

well  that s an awful long commute
to get dinner on the table by 5 00 
 and we switch 
 thank you 
excuse me 
excuse me  have you seen spencer 
i can t find him anywhere 
actually  spencer asked me
to take you home 
 he has this meeting  
 ln new york 
thank you 
 honey  what are you doing here 
 i m staying the night 
 spencer won t mind 
 spencer won t notice 
 he s in new york again  working 
 he s working hard for both of you 
don t lie for him  mother 
he does it so well for himself 
you re going to turn around 
go home   
   fix your face
and wait for your husband 
this is the bargain you made 
elizabeth  we all did 
so you re not gonna let me
stay in my own house 
spencer s house is your house now 
believe me  it s for your own good 
miss watson  come in 
seven law schools within 45 minutes
of philadelphia 
you can study and get dinner
on the table by 5 00 
 it s too late 
 no  some accept late admissions 
 i was upset at first 
 joan  the guests 
when tommy told me that he got
accepted to penn  i thought 
 her fate is sealed 
how can she throw it all away  
i realized you won t have to  you
could bake your cake and eat it too 
we re married 
we eloped over the weekend 
turned out he was petrified
of a big ceremony   
   so we did a sort of
spur of the moment thing 
very romantic 
look 
it s beautiful 
it was my choice  not to go 
he would have supported it 
 but you don t have to choose 
 no  i have to 
i want a home  a family 
it s not something i ll sacrifice 
no one s asking you
to sacrifice that  joan 
i just want you to understand
that you can do both 
think i ll wake up one day
and regret not being a lawyer 
yes  i m afraid that you will 
not as much as i d regret not having
a family  not being there to raise them 
i know exactly what i m doing  and
it doesn t make me any less smart 
 this must seem terrible to you 
 i didn t say that  i  
sure you did  you always do 
you stand in class and tell us to look
beyond the image  but you don t 
to you  a housewife is someone who
sold her soul for a center hall colonial 
she has no depth 
no intellect  no interests 
you re the one who said
i could do anything i wanted 
this is what i want 
congratulations 
be happy 
sometimes i think you say
these things to provoke me 
does your father know
that you speak this way 
does your wife know you re here 
 where might i find charlie stewart 
 charlie stewart  c1 744 
 but it s too late  you ll have to leave 
 all right 
you can t go up there 
what is going on here 
there s no women allowed
in the dorms 
can you please not interrupt me  
connie  what are you doing here 
well  i saw    
i saw big teeth with   
   kevin tawil looking pretty cozy 
and i thought that maybe    
maybe you two weren t    
 dating 
 yes  thank you 
hey  no girls in the dorm 
i know i have made mistakes 
a ton 
but i never make them twice 
and 
and it was perfect  romantic 
we stayed up all night talking

to sunday brunch 
we stayed up all night too 
not talking 
the psychoanalyst  again 
 divine exhaustion 
 he s married 
he s not married like
you and tommy 
what does that mean 
it means he and his wife
don t speak the same language 
 spelled s e x 
 does he pay you 
for sex 
at the rate you re going 
you could make a fortune 
 betty 
 everyone thinks so 
do you know what they say 
they say you re a whore 
once they ve all sampled you 
they ll toss you aside like a used rag 
 betty  stop now 
 the men you love don t want you 
 your father doesn t want you 
 i m gonna meet you downstairs 
 professor dunbar 
 betty  that s enough 
everybody knows that you hide
outside his house 
it must be torturous running after
a man who doesn t care about you   
   who s in love with someone else 
who hates you 
 he hates you 
 betty 
and it hurts  no 
 get off me 
 quiet 
oh  god

i think you came to help people
find your way 
i m not accustomed
to hunting you down 
elizabeth  look at me  please 
i ve spoken with mrs  jones 
there will be no divorce 
there s always a period
of adjustment 
i ve assured her that you will try
for a year 
look at this  mother 
spencer will try as well 
according to her  he s really
very upset  you should call him 
she s smiling  is she happy 
the important thing
is not to tell anyone 
she looks happy 
so  what does it matter 
don t wash your dirty laundry
in public 
let me tell you something 
not everything is as it seems

watch with me 
 you talked me into it    says this
oldie  what s the title of this one 
 you made me love you  
 you made me love   
 you made me love you  
you get all that from looking
at paint on a canvas   
   and it s her facial expression   
   her eyes that makes
you think that 
 i think that makes it interesting 
 the context that it comes from   
   affects the way we view it 
i think it provokes us because
it provoked the painter   
   and in turn  he s kind of sending
that message to us 
whether or not it s a good painting
cannot be subjective 
i feel like i m missing something 
it was joan s idea

miss watson 
dear betty 
i came to wellesley because
i wanted to make a difference 
but to change for others    
  is to lie to yourself 
my teacher   
   katherine watson 
lived by her own definition   
   and would not compromise that 
not even for wellesley 
i dedicate this  my last editorial   
    to an extraordinary woman   
    who lived by example   
   and compelled us all to see
the world through new eyes 
by the time you read this 
she ll be sailing to europe   
    where i know she ll find new walls
to break down   
   and new ideas
to replace them with 
hold it  everybody 
i ve heard her called a quitter
for leaving   
   an aimless wanderer 
but not all who wander are aimless 
especially not those who seek truth
beyond tradition   
   beyond definition   
   beyond the image 
get the hell out of the way 
i ll never forget you 
betty  betty 
what about after this war  lee
