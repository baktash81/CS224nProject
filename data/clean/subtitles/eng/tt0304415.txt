in the art history department
she pursued it singlemindedly
until she was hired
it was whispered
that katherine watson
a firstyear teacher
from oakland state
made up in brains
what she lacked in pedigree
which was why this bohemian
from california
was on her way to the most
conservative college in the nation
excuse me please
oh  sorry
excuse me
excuse me the bus
keep walking maam
thank you
but katherine watson didnt come
to wellesley to fit in
she came to wellesley because
she wanted to make a difference

giselle levy
giselle if someone could get the
susan delacorte

from the beginning man has always
had the impulse to create art
can anyone tell me what this is
wounded bison altamira spain
about 15000 bc
joan brandwyn
very good joan
despite the age of these they are
technically sophisticated because
the shading and the thickness of the
lines moving over the bisons hump
ls that right
yes thats exactly right
next slide
this is probably less familiar
it was discovered by archeologists
in 1879 lascaux france
dates back to 10000 bc
singled out because of flowing lines
depicting the movement of the animal
lmpressive name
herd of horses
i meant yours
we call her flicka
elizabeth warren
they call me betty
very good
betty is also correct
just because something is ancient
doesnt mean that it is primitive
for example next slide please
mycerinus and his queen 2470 bc
its a funerary statue
of the pharaoh and queen
originally intended to preserve
the pharaohs ka soul
have any of you taken
art history before
no
lets go on slide
seated scribe egypt 2400 bc
peasant couple plowing
sixteenth century bc egypt
snake goddess
minoan 1600 bc
fresco minoan 1600 bc
funeral mask mycenaean 1200
could someone please get
thank you
by a show of hands only
how many of you have read
the entire text
and the suggested supplements
long way from oakland state
well you girls do prepare
if youve nothing else for us
we could go to independent study
ac
i was in california once how do you
get work done with all that sunshine
we tan in class
really
no
you know not everybody
wanted you
im not naming any names
these jobs usually go quickly
exstudents friends of you know
the right people
the person they wanted took a job at
brown and no one else was available
so here you are
you can go in now good luck
your first class left a lot
to be desired miss watson
and im curious about the subject
of your dissertation
you suggest picasso will do
for the 20th century
what michelangelo did
for the renaissance  unquote
in terms of influencing movements
so these canvases that
theyre turning out these days
with paint dripped
and splotched on them
theyre as worthy of our attention
as michelangelos sistine chapel
im not comparing them
have you ever seen
the sistine chapel miss watson
actually stood there
ive never been to europe
i can assure all of you this is the place
i want to be more than anything
better discipline next class
miss watson
hello
its me
hey
collect from katherine watson
will you accept
yeah sure of course i will
hey is everything okay
yeah
tough huh
well how are the classes
snobs right
i hate to say i told you so
you dont have to
i cant really talk right now
ill write you tonight
so you got a fella
hes hes there im here
long distance torture i know
come come in and sit down
when lenny left for the south pacific
it nearly broke my heart
we wrote every day until
he was a great man
im sorry
lt was a hundred years ago
im babbling
i love lucy
even if she is a communist
the only thing red about lucy
is her hair
and even thats fake desi said it
winchell wrote it
amanda armstrong
i see you survived
katherine watson just barely
oh good youve met
katherines taken the third bedroom
how about a little dinner
before whats my line
how about a little drink
her companion died in may
companion
you know companion
josephine burns
taught biology here for 30 years
youll love it here katherine
youll see
i already do i honestly
its beautiful its perfect really
well dont fool yourself they have
claws underneath their white gloves
who
the alumnae their offspring
the faculty you name it
watch out for yourself
too much independence
frightens them
will you please stop
oh a word of advice
dont let those girls
know that they got to you
they didnt
good for you
you almost convinced me
what is that
you tell me
carcass by soutine 1 925
its not on the syllabus
no its not
is it any good
come on ladies
theres no wrong answer
theres also no textbook
telling you what to think
its not that easy is it
all right no its not good
in fact i wouldnt even call it art
its grotesque
is there a rule against
grotesque art
i think theres something
aggressive about it
and erotic
to you everything is erotic
everything is erotic
girls
arent there standards
of course
otherwise a tacky velvet painting
could be equated to a rembrandt
my uncle ferdie has two tacky velvet
paintings he loves those clowns
there are standards technique
composition color even subject
so if youre suggesting
that rotted side of meat is art
much less good art
then what are we going to learn
just that
you have outlined our new syllabus
betty thank you
what is art
what makes it good or bad
and who decides
next slide please
twentyfive years ago someone
thought this was brilliant
i can see that
who
my mother i painted it
for her birthday
next slide this is my mom
ls it art
its a snapshot
if i told you ansel adams had taken it
would that make a difference
art isnt art until someone says it is
its art
the right people
who are they
betty warren
were lucky we have one right here
screw you
could you go back
to the soutine please
just look at it again
look beyond the paint
let us try to open our minds
to a new idea
all right back to chapter three
has anyone read it

katherine watson had to take
this job to escape from california

without a home unless shes
sleeping with her ltalian professor

youre your mothers daughter
its a classic electra complex
i dont blame you i mean
who wouldnt want
to murder your mother
hey hows the harvard sweetheart
divine

did you do his homework
of course

no
this isnt what i think it is is it
whered you get it
from the school nurse
its against the law
oh honey its a girls best friend
a certain kind of girl
meet the last virgin bride
spencer is a gentleman
and even gentlemen have dicks
maybe ill get one
what a dick
dont be stupid connie
someone somewhere
someday might be interested
just in case
just in case ill be prepared
was that necessary
i was taught its best
to speak honestly
okay youre a bitch
we recently learned
that amanda armstrong
our nurse has been distributing
contraception to wellesley girls
this revelation is disturbing
to an institution
that prides itself on propriety
go go go go go
its been going on since the late 80s
whoever wins is first to marry
do the girls take it literally
only the girl with the winning hoop
oh look its phyllis nayor
good for her it gets me every time
why the buggies
theyve got their man
theyre wishing for their babies
have you seen this
what is it
its a frontpage attack on amanda
armstrong betty warren wrote it
by providing contraception
on demand our school nurse
is little more than a cheerleader
for promiscuity wow
oh theyre not going to dump her
in a lake
im coming phyllis
have you seen this
i wouldnt worry bettys just
a young girl flexing her muscles
so was lizzie borden
and her mother wasnt president
of the alumnae association
would somebody get that girl a towel
thats her mother
apple tree
is amanda going to get into trouble
amanda needs to start
minding her ps and qs
the trick to surviving wellesley
is never getting noticed
ciao mona lisa
the big war hero
he thinks hes something special
he sleeps with his students
the gold is fine
the napkin rings are vulgar
the glassware should be trimmed
with gold
the little sugar boxes gold and white
filled with chocolate no candlesticks
freesia instead of daisies
wise choice madam
no babys breath
you already had your fitting
were on our way
heres the seating chart
and spencers list of groomsmen
oh i almost forgot
i spoke to him about reading the
poem hed rather not i said all right
excuse us for a second joan
a good wife lets her husband
think that everythings his idea
even when its not
i dont care if he reads it
you will in retrospect
now why dont you see if you
cant nudge the idea into his head
ive been here now
for 21 years jocelyn
i remember you as a student
twentyfour if you count that
so why the theatrics
we cannot appear
to promote sexual promiscuity
okay its about appearances then
no
all right all right
all right well i promise not to appear
to be sympathetic progressive
or what did mrs warren
call it liberal
scouts honor
i spent the better part of friday
afternoon convincing the alumnae
that your record was impeccable
that you would no longer
provide contraceptive devices
and youd make
a public statement to that effect
im not willing to make
a public statement
it doesnt matter amanda
theyre letting you go
its out of my hands
and this champagne cup
is in the wrong place
and up and down and up and
katherine good evening
miss watson
good evening miss watson
join us
no
good night miss watson
good night miss watson
and down very nice very nice
hey
heard about amanda im sorry
she seemed all right about it
i wouldnt be
they dont give you
too many chances around here
oh that depends how much
they hate you to begin with
can i buy you a drink
or are you here for dinner
how long do
the marriage lectures take
get this woman a booth
your husband is at a crossroads
in his career
hes competing for promotion
against two rivals smith and jones
to get the edge you have wisely
decided to invite the boss
and his wife to a 700 dinner
youve carefully planned
your meal
set your table
and arranged for a babysitter
oh we have babies
yes and i have twins
then surprise its 61 5
and your husbands called to say
that smith jones and their wives
have been invited
at the bosss request
ever the wellesley girl
you keep your cool
and understand
that the boss is probably testing you
as much as your husband what next
yes
file for divorce
thats very funny
but the thing is its not a joke
a few years from now
your sole responsibility
will be taking care
of your husband and children
you may all be here
for an easy a
but the grade that matters the most
is the one he gives you not me
youll need to
whatever you do
dont put the bosss wife
next to your husband
why not
shes screwing him
is that where you learned
to speak ltalian in ltaly
yeah
have you got a boyfriend
yes
you know if you were mine
id never let you go
i wouldnt have asked
your permission
yeah they say youre progressive
a forward thinker
are you
there are a lot of labels here
ive noticed
right family right school right art
right way of thinking
well saves the effort
on thinking for yourself
how do you expect to ever make
a difference if everything is a joke
oh katherine watson comes to
wellesley to set us all free come on
thank you for the drink
no no wait i was teasing
they have their own way
of doing things here
youve just gotta find a way
to work with them we all had to
im sorry
five years ago
theyd have slapped my wrist
but now theres a committee
for the protection of everything
they think youre dangerous
oh no darling no subversive
its gotten to the point
where you dont know
who is protecting whom from what
or should that be from whom
well whom gives a damn anyway
theyre doing me a favor really
will you be all right
better than that
i should really have left
when josephine died
nothing left to love
here anymore so

see you next year
1 954
sunflowers vincent van gogh 1 888
he painted what he felt
not what he saw
people didnt understand to them
it seemed childlike and crude
it took years for them to recognize
his actual technique
to see the way his brush strokes
seemed to make the night sky move
yet he never sold a painting
in his lifetime
this is his selfportrait
theres no camouflage no romance
honesty
now 60 years later where is he
famous
so famous in fact
that everybody has a reproduction
there are post cards
we have the calendar
with the ability to reproduce art
it is available to the masses
no one needs to own
a van gogh original
we do in the newport house
but its small tiny
they can paint their own
van gogh in a box ladies
the newest form
of massdistributed art
paint by numbers
now everyone can be van gogh
its so easy
just follow the simple instructions
and in minutes youre on
your way to being an artist
van gogh by numbers
ironic isnt it look at what
we have done to the man
who refused to conform
his ideals to popular taste
who refused to compromise
his integrity
we have put him in a tiny box
and asked you to copy him
so the choice is yours ladies
you can conform to what
other people expect or you can
i know be ourselves
youre a sight for sore eyes
i wouldve been on time but silly me
i thought class was in the classroom
glad you could join us mrs jones
we thought wed lost you
theres an unwritten rule for marr
dont bother
since your wedding youve missed
six classes a paper and your midterm
well thank god i didnt miss
the paintbynumbers lecture
i was on my honeymoon
and then i had to set up house
what does she expect
attendance
most of the faculty turn their heads
when the married students
miss a class or two
then why not get married
as freshmen
that way you could graduate without
actually ever stepping foot on campus
dont disregard our traditions
just because youre subversive
dont disrespect this class
just because youre married
dont disrespect me
just because youre not
come to class do the work
or ill fail you
if you fail me
there will be consequences
are you threatening me
im educating you
thats my job
miss watson
miss watson
whats this
every year the ars nominate a
member of the faculty to be our guest
the what
youll see come by tonight at 500
adams ribs a very secret society
wait here
first the oath
please raise both hands
do you swear not to repeat what
you see hear or smell tonight
smell
keep your hands up
yes smell
i do
itll only burn for a second
go on
and now that youve taken the oath
we get to ask you whatever we want
oh is that how it works
and you have to answer
who invited her
youre in time
for truth or consequences
i go first why arent you married
well
thats poisonous
im not married because
im not
i was engaged to patrick watts
everybody called him leo
and i never knew why
he was the first person
that i ever danced with
or smoked with
got incredibly drunk with and
well a lot of first things

im sorry to blab
its just so romantic
how fantastic
we split up
what
we split up
well that was fast
well not every relationship
is meant for marriage
some are strictly affairs
bill dunbar
hed be an affair lets talk
about that miss watson
you dont believe in withholding
do you
no i do however believe in manners
but for you ill make an exception
thats what were supposed to do
for married students right betty
professor dunbar and l
are not having an affair
did you have one
with william holden
connie
she asked about bill dunbar
how did you hear that
oh it is true
betty i told you
wont you regret never marrying
theres still time
i guess i assume that i will
at some point
im not gonna plan my life around it
neither should we
i didnt say that
you did to joan
thats what she told me
what are you saying
she knew you and tommy
were getting engaged
and she practically filled out
your application
i didnt say that
shes been accepted
now she just has to figure out
a way to tell tommy
why dont you do it youre good
at butting into peoples business
funny thats what they say
about you
spencer do i look all right
yeah fine
i dont have a lot of time speed it up
mr grouchy
all right here we go again
all right go ahead louise
married wellesley girls have become
quite adept at balancing obligations
one hears such comments as
i baste the chicken with one hand
and outline the paper with the other
while our mothers were called
to work for lady liberty
it is our duty nay obligation
to reclaim our place in the home
bearing the children that will carry
our traditions into the future
one must pause to consider why
miss katherine watson
instructor in the art history
department
has decided to declare war
on the holy sacrament of marriage
her subversive and political teachings
encourage our wellesley girls
to reject the roles
they were born to fill
thank you
slide
contemporary art
thats just an advertisement
quiet
t oday you just listen
what will the future scholars see
when they study us
a portrait of women today
there you are ladies
the perfect likeness
of a wellesley graduate
magna cum laude doing exactly
what she was trained to do
slide
a rhodes scholar
i wonder if she recites chaucer while
she presses her husbands shirts
slide
now you physics majors can calculate
the mass and volume
of every meat loaf you make
slide
a girdle to set you free
what does that mean
what does that mean
what does it mean
i give up
you win
the smartest women in the country
i didnt realize that
by demanding excellence
i would be challenging
what did it say
what did it say
the roles you were born to fill
is that right
the roles you were born to fill
its my mistake
class dismissed
these girls
are you proud president carr
yes actually i am
well you should be i guess
half of them are married
the other half give it a month or so
its really only a matter of time
theyre biding time
until somebody proposes
a hundred years ago it was
inconceivable for a woman
to be a college graduate
perhaps you should look back
to see how far weve come
im sorry from where i sit
its just a different kind of corset
well we can all use a little support
oh like amanda armstrong
she broke the law
according to betty warren
according to the state
of massachusetts
to hell with wellesley
im done
goddamn it
its brilliant really
a perfect ruse
a finishing school disguised
as a college they got me
what do you expect
more more
i thought it was a place for
tomorrows leaders not their wives
calm down please
no i will not
ive got 1 0 more minutes
meet me in my office meet me
how you feeling
stupid deceived
really really angry
change takes time you know
you gotta let them catch up with you
katherine this place needs you
i dont know how the hell they let
you in but im sure glad they did
the things i said to president carr
shell never let me back in
shes a pretty good egg
what things
dont worry
time will heal it
unless of course you want to go back
to california and that fiance of yours
were not engaged thanks
sorry i interrupted your class
katherine
i wanted to give you this
it was for christmas and
then i met your man so l
the sistine chapel
david
venus de milo and
mona lisa

a threeinone shot ready
you didnt even try
this game is probably a nono
in the better homes and gardens
not that i have ever been in the
better homes and gardens have you
no no im just an old soldier
they dont invite us
what do they say about them though
old soldiers never die we just
they just
become philandering
ltalian professors
that was below the belt
that was unkind
deeply unkind
you know i dont know how i feel
about being a rebound
ill leave
no you dont have to do that
ill get used to it
what are you doing
getting dressed
i had fun and im not looking
for anything serious
why dont you come down here

i dont want to teach a class wondering
why a girl is wearing my perfume
katherine l
i need your word

its not something ill sacrifice
no ones asking you
to sacrifice that joan
i just want you to understand
that you can do both

not as much as id regret not having
a family not being there to raise them

it doesnt make me any less smart
this must seem terrible to you
i didnt say that i
sure you did you always do
you stand in class and tell us to look
beyond the image but you dont
to you a housewife is someone who
sold her soul for a center hall colonial
she has no depth
no intellect no interests

of adjustment
ive assured her that you will try

look at this mother
spencer will try as well

dont wash your dirty laundry
in public

do you feel good about music
oh isnt he handsome
watch with me
you talked me into it  says this
oldie whats the title of this one
you made me love you
you made me love
you made me love you
you get all that from looking
at paint on a canvas
and its her facial expression
her eyes that makes
you think that
i think that makes it interesting
the context that it comes from
affects the way we view it
i think it provokes us because
it provoked the painter
and in turn hes kind of sending
that message to us
whether or not its a good painting
cannot be subjective
i feel like im missing something
it was joans idea
how else will you remember us
theyve invited you back
do you think they made a mistake
i do
elizabeth i dont see spencer

you in any court anywhere
maybe i can drop by next year
keep you on your toes
you will be here
miss watson
dear betty
i came to wellesley because
i wanted to make a difference
but to change for others
is to lie to yourself
my teacher
katherine watson
lived by her own definition
and would not compromise that
not even for wellesley
i dedicate this my last editorial
to an extraordinary woman
who lived by example
and compelled us all to see
the world through new eyes
by the time you read this
shell be sailing to europe
where i know shell find new walls
to break down
and new ideas
to replace them with
hold it everybody
ive heard her called a quitter
for leaving
an aimless wanderer
but not all who wander are aimless
especially not those who seek truth
beyond tradition
beyond definition
beyond the image
get the hell out of the way
ill never forget you
betty betty
what about after this war lee
