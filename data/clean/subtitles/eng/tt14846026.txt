have signed
the moscow armistice
which decrees that finland
must disarm the nazis
and drive them out of lapland 
the nazis adopt
a scorched earth tactic
and destroy
all roads  bridges 
villages and towns
in their path 
deep in the wilderness
of lapland 
there is a man who has decided
to leave the war behind him 
for good 
yeah 
he s riding
to his death anyway 
get off the horse 
where do you think
you re going  old man 
there s nothing down there 
we made sure of that 
what do you got there 
this old fucker
is a gold miner 
you got gold in those bags

thank you  general 
i will pass on
the information 
over and out 
the general 
he has given us orders 
turn back and head to norway
from finland immediately 
did you tell him he just
killed seven of our men 
i did 
and 
he thinks we were lucky 
fucking lucky 
the dog tags belong
to a man named aatami korpi 
he was a finnish commando 
the most feared in his unit 
the general said  and i quote 
 he s one mean motherfucker
 that you do not
want to mess with  
he fought in the winter war 
lost his home and his family
to the russians 
he became a ruthless 
vengeful soldier
who took orders from no one 
the finns  they gave up trying
to discipline or control him 
they just sent him out 
alone into the wilderness
to hunt russian patrols 
he became a one man
death squad 
the reports
are unconfirmed 
but it looks like
he has over 300 russian kills 
the russians 
they gave him a name 
they call him koschei 
 the immortal  
immortal 
the road is clear  sir 
we are going to follow
our orders  right 
we are turning back 
no 
we are not turning back 
we are losing the war  we are 
in a few months 
this all will be over for us 
when we get back 
they will   
hang us all 
that gold is our way out 
eyes open 
check the sides 
nothing here 
oh  wait

immortal or not 
a man needs air

by death

what the fuck
are you smiling for  then 
do you assholes really think
you have succeeded
where hundreds of russians
have died trying 
we all know the story 
you ll see what happens when
you take everything from him 
he won t give up 
he ll just keep coming back 
do you really believe
that he s immortal 
no 
he just refuses to die 
we have a word for that
in finland 
but it s impossible
to translate 
you see 
this is not about
who s the strongest 
this is about not giving up 
and he won t 
ever 
no matter what
you bitches are trying 
you will make him stronger 
so   
what is so fucking funny 
is that you   
your boyfriend   
and everything that is left
of your sorry assed company   
are already dead 
what 
was that one of ours 
was that jens
