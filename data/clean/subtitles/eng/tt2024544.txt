i have two gentlemen whose
acquaintance you should make
misters brown and hamilton
sir
mr northup these two gentlemen were
inquiring about distinguished individuals
and i was just this very moment
saying solomon northup
is an expert player on the violin
he was indeed
mr moon is being overly gracious
well taking into consideration his
graciousness and your modesty
may we trouble you for a moment
of your time to converse sir
of course
good day
a circus
that is our usual employee
the company currently
in the city of washington
circus is too constricting a word
to describe the talented and
merry band with which we travel
it is a spectacle unlike most
have ever witnessed
creatures from the darkest africa
as yet unseen by civilized man
acrobats from the orient
who contort themselves in the
most confounding manners
and i myself in aide of mr brown
an internationally renowned practitioner
in the art of prestidigitation
we are on our way thither to rejoin
the company having left for a short time
to make a small profit
from our own exhibitions
the reason for our inquiry with mr moon
yes we had just a devil of a time in
procuring music for our entertainments
men of true talents are seemingly in short supply
thank you sir
if we could persuade you to accompany us
as far as washington
we could give you one dollar
for each days services
and three dollars for every night
played at our performances
in addition we would provide sufficient pay
for your return here to saratoga
two weeks from today
welcome to washington solomon
hamilton you know too much
some say not enough
solomon 43 dollars
all to you
that is far more than my wages amount to
its been a most profitable week sir
cheers
cheers

and your talents are undeniable
to solomon

i am the god of abraham
the god of isaac and the god of jacob
and when the multitude heard this
they were astonished at his doctrine
and then one of them which was a lawyer
asked him a question tempting him
the creek is plenty deep enough to sail
even with a boat full of load
the distance from the work area to
the point on the latter bayou
is several miles by water fewer than land
it occurs to me that the expense of
transportation would be materially diminished
materially diminished
if we use the waterway
are you an engineer or a nigger
are you an engineer or a nigger
let the man say his piece
its a scheme plenty of engineers
have schemed similarly
the passes are too tight
i reckon them at more than 12 feet
at their most narrow
wide enough for a tub to traverse
if a team of niggers cleared it out
and you know what of transport
and terraforming
i labored repairing the champlain canal
on the section over which william
van nortwick was superintendent
with my earnings i hired several
efficient hands to assist me
and entered into contracts for the transportation of
large rafts of timber from lake champlain to troy
well ill admit to being
impressed even if you wont
collect a team
see what good you can do
you good
clear it out
two three
for me
too late for me
i live or die
lay down and cry
hey boy im tired
my lord sometimes
im strong yes sir
im tall yes sir
platt you are a marvel
what took you so long
thank you master ford
platt
my great thanks master ford
no my thanks to you
and it is the least of it
i hope it brings us both much joy
over the years
god
eliza
eliza
stop
stop your wailing
if you let yourself be overcome
by sorrow you will drown in it
have you stopped crying for your children
you make no sounds but will you
ever let them go in your heart
they are as my flesh
then who is distressed
do i upset the master and the mistress
do you care less about my loss
than their wellbeing
master ford is a decent man
he is a slaver
under the circumstances
under the circumstances he is a slaver
but you truckle at his boot
you luxuriate in his favour
i survive
i will not fall into despair
i will offer up my talents to master ford
i will keep myself hearty
until freedom is opportune
ford is your opportunity
you think he does not know that
you are more than you suggest
but he does nothing for you
nothing
you are no better than prized livestock
call for him
call
tell him of your previous circumstances
and see what it earns you solomon
so youve settled into your role as platt then
my back is thick with scars
for protesting my freedom
do not accuse me
i accuse you of nothing
i cannot accuse
i have done dishonorable things to survive
and for all of them i have ended up here
no better than if i stood up for myself
god forgive me
solomon let me weep for my children
whosoever therefore shall humble
himself as this little child
the same is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven
and who so shall receive one
such little child in my name
i cannot have that kind of depression about
but who so shall offend one of these little ones
it were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck
and he were drowned in the depth of the sea
amen
amen
make them boards flush
they are sir
no they is no such thing
they are as smooth to the touch
as a yearlings coat
are you calling me a liar boy
its all a matter of perspective sir
from where you stand
you may see differently
but the hands are not mistaken
i simply ask that you use all your
senses before rendering judgment
oh my you are a brute
you are a dog
and no better for following instruction
i do as ordered
then youll be up at daybreak
you will procure a keg of nails from chapin
and commence to putting on clapboards
yes sir
make them boards flush
no please
please sam
where am i going
where am i going sam
solomon solomon
solomon
solomon
solomon
when i say i had my masters favor
you understand
and for nine years he blessed me
with every comfort and luxury in life
silks and jewels and even
servants to wait upon us
such was our life
and the life of this beautiful girl i bore for him
but master berrys daughter
she always looked at me with an unkind nature
and she hated emily no matter she
and emily were flesh of flesh
as master berrys health failed
she gained power of the household
and eventually i was brought to the city under the
false pretense of our free papers being executed
my poor children
i thought i told you to commence
to putting on clapboards
yes master im about it
these have all been replaced
and didnt i tell you to get a keg of nails
and so i did
so you did
god damn you
i thought you know something
i did as instructed
if theres something wrong
its wrong with the instruction
you black bastard
you goddamn black bastard
strip your clothes
strip
i will not
you will not live to see another day nigger
help
murder
im sorry
im sorry
im sorry im sorry
what is the matter
what is the matter
master tibeats wants to whip me
for using the nails you gave me
this aint done by half
i will have flesh
and i will have all of it
do not stir
do not leave the plantation
for if you run i cannot protect you
stay here
gentlemen whoever moves
that nigger is a dead man
i am the overseer on this plantation
william ford holds the mortgage on platt
if you hang him he will lose his debt
you have no claim to his life
as for you two
if you have any regard for your own safety
i say be gone
you got no cause
platt is mine and mine to do with as i please
if you touch
sam
fetch the mule
get master ford
platt
poor platt
i believe tibeats is skulking
about the premises somewhere
he wants you dead and he will have it so
its no longer safe for you here
and i dont believe you will
remain passive if tibeats attacks
i have transferred my debt to edwin epps
he will take charge
master ford
you must know that im not a slave
i cannot hear that
before i came to you i was a freeman
im trying to save your life
and i have a debt to be mindful of
and that is to edwin epps now
and he is a hard man
prides himself on being a nigger breaker
but truthfully i could find
no others who would take you
youve made a reputation of yourself
whatever the circumstances
you are an exceptional nigger platt
but i fear no good will come of it
and that servant
which knew his lords will
which knew his lords will
and prepared not himself
prepared not himself
neither did according to his will
shall be beaten with many stripes
do you hear that
stripes
that nigger that dont obey his lord

that there nigger shall be
beaten with many stripes

and me enjoying the pantomime of his fidelity
if that what keep me from cotton
picking niggers that what it be
a small and reasonable price
to be paid for sure
i know what it like to be the object of
masters predilections and peculiarities
a lusty visit in the night
or a visitation with the whip

thats my girl
dont ever let me down
platt
160 pounds
armsby
64 pounds
a good days labor would average 200 pounds
yes sir
im sure in time youll develop as a picker
but it takes effort boy
put some damn effort into it
yes sir
take them out get to whipping
its a tragedy
how does such come to pass
working a field and picking
cotton like a lowly hand
im of a damn sight better station
i worked as an overseer you know
i did not know sir
not sir
just armsby
im not owed more than any other in the field
how did you arrive at such a place if i may ask
ask its just conversation
i became a little too dependent on the whiskey
a little too undependable on the job
now before you say
im just a sorry drunkard
let me state my case
as reliable employment as overseeing is
it is no easy chore on the spirit
i say no man of conscious
can take the lash to another
human day in and day out
without shredding at his own self
takes him to a place
where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected
or he finds some way to trample
his guilty sensations
so i trampled
with frequency
i gave in to tales of wealth and prosperity
but such profitable outcomes are
reserved for plantation masters
its the lot of the rest of us to serve
now all i want is to earn a
decent wage and get myself home
the proceeds of my fiddling performances
just a few picayunes
but all i have in the world
i promise them to you if you
will do me the favor i require
but i beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request
what is it you ask
first your word sir
on my honor
its a simple enough request
i only ask that you deposit a letter
at the post office in marksville and that you
keep the action an inviolable secret forever
a patron is what i require sir
ill do it
and ill accept whatever payments offered
to assist you i put my own self at risk
i will do so
but fair compensation is all i ask
draw up your letter
well meet again in two days
in two days
thank you
well boy
i understand i got a learned
nigger that writes letters
tries to get white fellas to mail them
armsby told me today the devil was
among my niggers
that i had one that needed watching
or he would run away
when i asked him why
he said you come over to him
waked him up in the middle of the night
and wanted him to carry a letter
to marksville
what do you got to say to that
theres no truth to it
you say
how could i write a letter without ink or paper
who am i gonna write to
i got no friends living as i know of
that armsby
that armsby is a lying drunken fellow
didnt he want you to hire him as an overseer
well thats it
he wants to make you believe
were all gonna run away
so youll hire him as an overseer
he believes youre a soft soap
and hes given to such talk
made this story out of whole cloth
because he wants a situation
its all a lie master
its all a lie
ill be damned
were he not free and white platt
were he not free and white
sun gonna set here
under the mountain
sun gonna set here
under the mountain
sun gonna set here
under the mountain
edward

right to the end
hey bass
oh no no no
no shame in taking respite from the heat
drink shade
its ungodly for travelers hearty or otherwise
whats funny
epps i merely mean to finish
the work at hand as requested
and as paid for
if something rubs you wrongly
i offer you the opportunity to speak on it
you ask plainly so i will tell you plainly
what amused me just then was your concern
for my wellbeing in this heat
when quite frankly the condition of your laborers
the condition of my laborers
it is horrid
its all wrong
all wrong mr epps
they aint hired help
theyre my property
you say that with pride
i say it as fact
if this conversation concerns
what is factual and what is not
then it must be said that there is no justice
nor righteousness in their slavery
but you do open up an interesting question
what right have you to your niggers
when you come down to the point
what right
i bought them
i paid for them
of course you did and the law says
you have the right to hold a nigger
but begging the laws pardon it lies
suppose they pass a law taking away
your liberty making you a slave
suppose
that aint a supposable case
laws change epps
universal truths are constant
it is a fact
a plain and simple fact that what is true
and right is true and right for all
white and black alike
you comparing me to a nigger bass
im only asking in the eyes of god
what is the difference
you might as well ask what the difference
is between a white man and a baboon
i seen one of them critters in orleans
know just as much as any nigger i got
listen epps
these niggers are human beings
if they are allowed to climb no
higher than brute animals
you and men like you will have to answer for it
there is an ill mr epps
a fearful ill resting upon this nation
and there will be a day of reckoning yet
you like to hear yourself talk bass
better than any man i know of
youd argue that black was white
or white black
if anybody would contradict you
a fine supposition if you lived
among yankees in new england
but you dont
you most assuredly do not
i knew it i knew it i knew it
patsey
pats
where is she
wheres pats
where is she damn it
where is she

lies to your misdeeds
the sabbath day master
i took me
a walk to commune with the lord
bring the lord into your deceptions
youre coming from shaws plantation
no
master epps
now you speak
now that you want to add to her
lies you find your tongue
i went to master shaws plantation
ah
you admit it
yes freely
and you know why
i got this from mistress shaw
mistress epps wont even grant
me no soap to clean with
i stink so much i make myself gag
500 pounds of cotton
day in day out
more than any man here
and for that i will be clean
thats all i ask
this here what i went to shaws for
liar
the lord knows thats all
youre a liar
and you blind with your own covetousness
i dont lie master
if you kill me ill stick to that
ill fetch you down
ill learn you to go to shaws
treach
run and fetch some line

somewhere in the course of eternal justice
thou shalt answer for this sin
sin
there is no sin
man does how he pleases with his property
at the moment platt im of great pleasure
you be goddamn careful i dont want to
come and lighten my mood no further
master bass
i want to ask you what part
of the country you come from
no part of this land
i originate from canada
now guess where that is
i know where canada is
ive been there myself
montreal
and kingston and queenston
and a great many places
welltraveled for a slave
how came you here
master bass
if justice had been done
i never would have been here
hows this
tell me all
im afraid to tell you
every word you speak is a profound secret
your story
it is amazing
and in no good way
do you believe sir in justice as you said
i do
that slavery is an evil that should befall none
i believe so
if you truly do
then i ask i beg
that you write my friends in the north
acquainting them of my situation
and beseeching them to forward free papers
it would be
an unspeakable happiness
to see my wife
and my family again
i traveled this country for the best part of 20 years
and my freedom is everything
the fact that i can walk out of here
tomorrow brings me great pleasure
my life doesnt mean much to anyone
it seems yours might mean
a lot to a whole lot of people
but what you ask of me sir scares me
and i must say i am afraid
not just for you but for me
i will write your letter sir
and if it brings you your freedom
it will be more than a pleasure
it will have been my duty
now would you kindly hand me those shingles
