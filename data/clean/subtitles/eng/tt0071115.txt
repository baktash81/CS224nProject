and i m never going to get a tip again 
 both laughing 
you re so funny 
boy 
you really need someone to talk to 
don t you 
you know  i bet you sure get lonesome 
don t you 
yep  i miss my friend bea 
what time is it now  about 2 30 
exactly  how did you know that 
i can feel it 
bea is now watching all my children 
there s this character
on the show named jeff   
and she s just madly in love with him 
you want me to fix you up
with somebody 
i know lots of guys
who d fall down over you 
their brains would fall out 
and they d froth at the mouth 
that sounds attractive 
thanks a lot  but i don t think so 
besides  i kind of got my eye
on daddy duke 
 both laughing 
honey  if you change your mind 
just let me know 
alice  i sure will 
alice  isn t that sun wonderful 
 is today the ripple day 
 no  not today 
 you want to steal something 
 steal what 
 i don t know  what do you need 
 nothing  really 
what do you want 
nothing  except some guitar strings 
but they re real expensive 
 where are they  at chicago music store 
 yeah 
audrey  let s go  darling 
come on 
 audrey groaning 
are you all right 
 my knee 
 what happened 
there s a slick spot on your floor 
i hope this doesn t ruin
my tryout for cheerleader 
i m so sorry  maybe you just stumbled 
 thank you very much  sir 
 good luck on your cheerleading 
david  i d rather take a whipping
than mend fences 
maybe it would be easier
to get an electric fence 
not really 
they d be out in about a week  anyway 
they smell the apples over there
and get wilder than a guinea 
alice  what does 
david  the cows 
david  don t try and understand a cow 
alice  okay 
david  the only thing dumber than a cow
is a chicken 
turkeys are worse 
you know what a little turkey does
when it rains 
put their head back
and open up their mouths and drown 
alice  they do not 
david  they do  too 
my grandmother lost about 200 of them
once in one rainstorm 
alice  could i touch your beard 
alice  it s soft 
david  your brother taught you to kiss 
alice  i don t mean he demonstrated 
he told me that
the worst thing that can happen   
is if a boy feels like he s put his lips
in a bowl of wet oatmeal 
at least he said  lips  
so the most important thing
to remember before you kiss   
is to wipe your mouth real good
and keep your lips together   
so he doesn t kiss your teeth 
we went to see
the postman always rings twice 
and there was this big close up of    
what s her name 
lana turner and john garfield  right 
they re coming together 
big dramatic moment 
at last  they re going to kiss 
alice  the music s playing  very dramatic 
just as they come together 
they both open their mouths 
i thought   my god  don t they know
how to kiss  what s wrong with them  
i turned and looked at my brother
to see what he was going to say 
alice  he didn t move 
he was just looking at screen 
alice  he didn t say anything
for three weeks 
then all of a sudden one day  he says 
 well  al  i ve been thinking  
david  al 
alice  yes  he always called me al 
 l think maybe you re supposed to
part your lips a little bit when you kiss  
god bless him 
if not  i had my work cut out for me 
alice  so anyway  and then   
we decided we wanted to go
into show business from the movies 
why did you leave 
i got married  and donald
wanted to live in his hometown 
i wanted to go on singing 
he said   no wife of mine
is going to sing in a saloon  
i said   yes  master   i kind of liked that 
david  you liked it 
alice  it was like  you know   
my idea of a man  strong and dominating 
 both laughing 
i ll show you our act 
this is what we used to do 
i figure  i don t know 
the bubble dancer didn t show up 
so they called my brother and i 
my brother would enter and walk onstage 
and i d be behind him   
making the same moves 
so that you couldn t see me from the front 
and then he d get out and say 
 usually i do an act with my sister   
 but she didn t show up today  
and then i would    
then they would laugh again 
 so we d do it on the other side  right 
 that s a hell of an act 
that s what we did 
that was my start in show business 
alice  and then  
david  tough act to follow 
alice  we never got paid for it 
i found out years later   
that people got paid
for being in show business 
when i was 19  i got a job
in this really nice hotel in monterey 
i would play the piano and sing 
i really liked it there 
that s why i want to go back
and pick up where i left off 
david  which do you want 
alice  what do you mean 
do you want to go home 
or do you want to sing 
i want to do both  can t i have everything 
 you think they re the same 
 you mean  they re not 
i don t know  that was a while ago 
i have an idea  fella 
david  i ve been getting one myself 
alice  an idea 
david  yeah  what s yours 
 i have to show it to you 
 what 
if you come with me into the other room 
i ll show you my idea   
if you ll show me yours 
tommy  shoot the dog 
didn t you get it  i ll tell it to you 
in the beginning  the guy s saying 
 what do you want me
to do with the gun   he doesn t tell him 
then the guy says   shoot the dog  
he says   shoot the dog  
he says   shoot the dog  
wait a minute 
do you see why he said shoot the dog 
hi  what are you two up to 
 we re gonna go fishing by this  
 by a spring fed lake by pittsville 
 a spring fed lake up by pittsville

i mean  it s like i always felt
that he was taking care of me   
and now i just don t know what to do 
honey  it s nice
to have somebody take care of you 
but he didn t 
i just felt like he did
just because he was there 
i don t know how to live without a man 
that s what it is 
flo  i want to tell you something 
my life ain t exactly a bed of petunias 
i got me a daughter 
cutest little thing you ever saw

something to do with it 
 flo laughing 
flo  look at that face  look at that body 
honey  the lord blessed you with talent 
you can sing 
i don t know about that 
you never heard me sing 
you got to be good at it  you had a job 
i used to be good when i was a kid 
but i m not good anymore 
 my voice has a wiggle in it 
 i won t bullshit you 
you better get that wiggle out of
your voice or take up something else 
i m so mad at david  i could just kill him

crying in the toilet  would i 
 alice  have you seen this 
 yeah 
 i made it myself 
 did you 
did you ever notice what it s made out of 
safety pins 
honey  that s what holds me together 
now  the first thing you got to do
is figure out what you want 
once you know that 
you just jump in there with both feet   
and let the devil take the hindmost 
if david comes back 
i ll give him a bust right in the mouth 
mel  this is wrong

under your bed  he better straighten up 
alice  okay  i ll tell him

mel  ready on the side of tomatoes
