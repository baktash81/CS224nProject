exactly how did you know that
i can feel it
bea is now watching all my children
theres this character
on the show named jeff
and shes just madly in love with him
you want me to fix you up
with somebody
i know lots of guys
whod fall down over you
their brains would fall out
and theyd froth at the mouth
that sounds attractive
thanks a lot but i dont think so
besides i kind of got my eye
on daddy duke
both laughing
honey if you change your mind
just let me know
alice i sure will
alice isnt that sun wonderful
is today the ripple day
no not today
you want to steal something
steal what
i dont know what do you need
nothing really
what do you want
nothing except some guitar strings
but theyre real expensive
where are they at chicago music store
yeah
audrey lets go darling
come on
audrey groaning
are you all right
my knee
what happened
theres a slick spot on your floor
i hope this doesnt ruin
my tryout for cheerleader
im so sorry maybe you just stumbled
thank you very much sir
good luck on your cheerleading
david id rather take a whipping
than mend fences
maybe it would be easier
to get an electric fence
not really
theyd be out in about a week anyway
they smell the apples over there
and get wilder than a guinea
alice what does
david the cows
david dont try and understand a cow
alice okay
david the only thing dumber than a cow
is a chicken
turkeys are worse
you know what a little turkey does
when it rains
put their head back
and open up their mouths and drown
alice they do not
david they do too
my grandmother lost about 200 of them
once in one rainstorm
alice could i touch your beard
alice its soft
david your brother taught you to kiss
alice i dont mean he demonstrated
he told me that
the worst thing that can happen
is if a boy feels like hes put his lips
in a bowl of wet oatmeal
at least he said lips
so the most important thing
to remember before you kiss
is to wipe your mouth real good
and keep your lips together
so he doesnt kiss your teeth
we went to see
the postman always rings twice
and there was this big closeup of
whats her name
lana turner and john garfield right
theyre coming together
big dramatic moment
at last theyre going to kiss
alice the musics playing very dramatic
just as they come together
they both open their mouths
i thought my god dont they know
how to kiss whats wrong with them
i turned and looked at my brother
to see what he was going to say
alice he didnt move
he was just looking at screen
alice he didnt say anything
for three weeks
then all of a sudden one day he says
well al ive been thinking
david al
alice yes he always called me al
l think maybe youre supposed to
part your lips a little bit when you kiss
god bless him
if not i had my work cut out for me
alice so anyway and then
we decided we wanted to go
into show business from the movies
why did you leave
i got married and donald
wanted to live in his hometown
i wanted to go on singing
he said no wife of mine
is going to sing in a saloon
i said yes master i kind of liked that
david you liked it
alice it was like you know
my idea of a man strong and dominating
both laughing
ill show you our act
this is what we used to do
i figure i dont know
the bubble dancer didnt show up
so they called my brother and i
my brother would enter and walk onstage
and id be behind him
making the same moves
so that you couldnt see me from the front
and then hed get out and say
usually i do an act with my sister
but she didnt show up today
and then i would
then they would laugh again
so wed do it on the other side right
thats a hell of an act
thats what we did
that was my start in show business
alice and then
david tough act to follow
alice we never got paid for it
i found out years later
that people got paid
for being in show business
when i was 19 i got a job
in this really nice hotel in monterey
i would play the piano and sing
i really liked it there
thats why i want to go back
and pick up where i left off
david which do you want
alice what do you mean
do you want to go home
or do you want to sing
i want to do both cant i have everything
you think theyre the same
you mean theyre not
i dont know that was a while ago
i have an idea fella
david ive been getting one myself
alice an idea
david yeah whats yours
i have to show it to you
what
if you come with me into the other room
ill show you my idea
if youll show me yours
tommy shoot the dog
didnt you get it ill tell it to you
in the beginning the guys saying
what do you want me
to do with the gun he doesnt tell him
then the guy says shoot the dog
he says shoot the dog
he says shoot the dog
