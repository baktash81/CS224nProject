barbarella s psychedelia

  barbarella 
  mr  president 
  love 
  love 
just a minute 
i ll slip something on 
don t trouble yourseif 
this is an affair of state 
what i must say not only is grave   
it s a secret 
a secret 
have you ever heard of a young
scientist named duran duran 
 yes 
  recently en route to the north star   
   he vanished into
the uncharted regions of tau ceti 
but    why is that a secret 
because duran duran is the inventor
of the positronic ray 
  it s a weapon 
  weapon 
why would anyone want
to invent a weapon 
how should i know 
the universe has been
pacified for centuries  sir 
as far as we know  yet we know
nothing of tau ceti or its inhabitants 
could they still be in a primitive
state of neurotic irresponsibility  
precisely  and if they learn
from this young scientist   
   the secret of the positronic ray   
   they will be able to shatter
the loving union of the universe 
  that might mean archaic insecurity   
  and war 
  you mean seifish competition and   
  i mean war 
  bloody conflict among entire tribes 
  i don t believe it 
neither do i 
but we can t take a chance 
  something must be done 
  yes  you re the girl who must do it 
  why me 
  i have no armies or police 
i can t spare the presidential band 
plus  you re a 5 star astro navigatrix 
your mission then 
find duran duran   
   and use your incomparable talents
to preserve the security of the stars   
   and our own mother planet 
how do you read me 
  straight 
  here s the one known photo of duran 
age 26  hazel eyes 
a rather handsome fellow 
i don t think i ll be able
to recognize him  sir 
now  this is a
portable brainwave detector 
attention   
set your atom transmitter at 0 3 5 
  positive 
  object in transit 
object received 
in order to test for duran duran s
presence  simply press this contact 
  light will glow  the alarm will sound 
  it has a built in tongue box 
here is something you may need 
  it s a weapon 
  for seif preservation 
we borrowed it from
the museum of conflict 
that s my good girl 
one day  barbarella   
   we must meet in the flesh 
thank you  and    love

do you speak english 
parlez vous francais 
wait  let me adjust my tongue box 
must be a galactic 5 dialect 
but i haven t skied in ages 
but that s duran duran s spaceship 
hi 
listen  children  this game is amusing 
but it s gone too far 
i don t want to hurt you  i want to know
some things about this spaceship 
come on  untie me
or i ll call your parents 
that s very sweet  but i   
no 
help 
help 
stop 
hello 
thank you 
no 
i can t understand 
parlez vous francais 
better adjust my tongue box 
are you all right 
i think so    who are you 
i am mark hand  the catchman 
and who are you 
i m from the planet earth  tell me
what you know of this spaceship 
i know nothing  it was here when i
accepted the job of the catchman 
  catchman 
  yes  children live on icey weir   
   until they have reached
a serviceable age 
  serviceable 
  then i capture them just as you saw 
  i turn them over to the authorities 
  i see 
thank you 
ever heard the name duran duran 
i know nothing  i live alone on icey
weir  such is a catchman s life 
only in sogo will you find
the answer to your question 
  sogo  is it near  
  it s just beyond that ice deck 
did i see your spacecraft
at the far edge of this lake 
yes  but i m afraid it s broken down 
  magnetic storms ruined my stabilizer 
  perhaps  i can help 
i m quite experienced mechanically 
i service and maintain this icecraft 
  if you wish  i ll take you to your ship 
  but there s no wind 
hold on 
  what a lovely cabin 
  wind 
i m so grateful for your help 
how can i ever thank you 
i m sure my government
would repay you 
if there s anything i can do 
please tell me 
you could let me make love to you 
  make love 
  yes 
you don t even know
my psycho cardiogram 
on earth people don t make love   
   unless their psycho cardiograms
are in perfect confluence 
you asked me what you could do
for me  and i told you 
all right 
but i don t see what good it will do 
  do you have any pills 
  pills 
  never mind  i have some here 
  what is this pill 
an exaltation transference pill 
of course 
  i know nothing of this 
  i see 
on earth when our psycho cardiograms
are in harmony for lovemaking   
   we take
an exaltation transference pill 
and remain like this 
here let me show you 
for one minute or
until full rapport is achieved 
i don t care for that 
this is what i mean   the bed 
that 
but nobody s done that for centuries 
except the poor who can t afford
the pill or psycho cardiograms 
  why not 
  it impedes maximum efficiency 
also substitutes for ego support
and seif esteem are now available 
  so  you won t do it 
  if you insist  i guess so 
but there s really no point
at all in doing it like this 
  without your garments  please 
  oh 
now i ll have a look at your stabilizers 
since your garment is torn  help
yourseif to my furs  barbarella 
i think i ve found the trouble 
you may proceed now to sogo 
it s there you will find duran duran jr 
if he still lives   
good 
now  barbarella 
don t you agree with me   
   that in some things 
the old fashioned ways are best 
what     oh  that 
yes  i must admit it
ws rather interesting 
still  it is distracting 
  are you coming with me to sogo 
  no  i prefer the tranquility of weir 
sogo is too strict 
the people too dedicated 
perhaps you ll stop here again   
at the end of your mission 
yes  perhaps i will   
well  goodbye  and thanks again   
for everything 
it ws my pleasure 
  please advise present situation 
  you wouldn t understand 
  stabilizer s maifunctioning 
  i ve been repaired in reverse 
we re going in 
i ll activate the terra screw 
barbarella 
barbarella

got to get rid of this tail 
  i m dead 
  no 
  where am i 
  in the labyrinth of the city of night 
  are you an angel 
  i m pygar  the last ornithanthrope 
  how do you do 
  and you 
i m from planet earth 
my name is barbarella 
but you re soft and wrm 
we re told that earth beings are cold 
not all of us   
my poor spaceship  look at it 
i m so sorry 
pygar  what happened to your eyes 
l fell during a magnetic storm
and ws carried off to sogo 
sogo 
the city of night ruled by the great
tyrant  there they blinded me 
l ws left to die in the labyrinth
until professor ping found me 
that s terrible 
can you really fly  
no  l ve lost the will to fly 
  how awful 
  lt no longer matters  lt s the past 
  have you heard of duran duran 
  duran duran 
yes  duran duran 
he s an astronaut from earth 
l do not know of such things 
  perhaps professor ping can help 
  professor ping 
he s very wise
and knows all about sogo 
  where can i  find him 
  he s with the others  eating 
  he s there  professor ping 
  professor ping 
  yes 
  my name is barbarella 
tell me  what is your origin 
you have the aspect of an earthling 
you are of female gender  right 
that is correct 
  is that an orchid 
  yes 
orchids have very little food value
and are hard to grow in this climate 
it amuses the great tyrant to resent
the expense of feeding orchids to slaves 
  what kind of place is this 
  that is sogo  the city of night   
   ruled by the great tyrant
and dedicated to evil in every form 
and this is the labyrinth 
all that is not evil is exiled
to the labyrinth 
look 
  who is that gentleman 
  that is a grand grotesque 
that s the classic way
of ending life in the labyrinth 
professor ping  have you ever heard
of duran duran 
duran duran from earth 
yes  indeed 
  he s alive  where 
  in sogo  no doubt 
i must go there at once 
but as you ve seen 
no one may leave the labyrinth 
  i  have a spaceship  if only it worked 
  my child  perhaps i  can help you 
if only you could   
let me take you there 
pygar  will you show us the way  
  what seems to be the trouble 
  i  think it s the stabilizers 
let s have a look 
pygar  pen   
here    thank you 
thank heaven the hypodontical
molecules are undamaged 
  will it take long 
  hours  days  weeks 
who knows 
genius is mysterious 
i can t wit weeks 
pygar  
  you can fly me there 
  no  i  can t 
atrophy of the greater alea muscle 
the angel is aerodynamically sound 
it s all a question of morale 
there s nothing to do but wit 
pygar  where do you live 
come  i ll tell you how to lead me 
  just ahead 
  it s a nest 
  why  yes  that s where i  live 
  lt s marvelous 
i m glad you like it

help 
pygar  right in front of you 
pygar  no  to the right

they re without fleshy substance 
pygar  you saved my life 
pygar  
pygar    oh  pygar 
be careful 
oh  pygar 
interesting therapy 
  i ve regained the will to fly 
  i  know 
oh  it ws   
it ws just heavenly 
  can you take me to sogo 
  but i  cannot see 
  i  will be your eyes  pygar 
  i  do not believe it is possible 
we ll be shot down
by black guard patrols 
not with my mini missile projector 
we won t 
  are you all right  pygar  
  yes  thank you 
i don t like the looks of that 
a little to the right 
pygar  wtch out

we can hide behind that mountain 
pygar 
pygar 
  are you all right 
  yes 
just in time 
my energy box is completely dead 
are we all right now  
i think so  excuse me 
we re there  lt s right below us 
we must land in a back street 
for your sake 
to be seen in sogo with an angel
would be anathema 
pygar  keep your head down 
oh my  we must find something
to hide your wings 
wait  barbarella 
  don t be afraid  pygar 
  i  sense danger  guard yourseif 
there s nothing

  chamber of ultimate   
   solution   
i don t like the sound of that 
we d better get out of here 
ye who have chosen to die 
be welcome 
to terminate the bitterness of life 
you may select from three exciting   
   and surprising forms of death 
one of each awaits behind the doors
you see before you 
if you fail to choose  you ll be given
to the mathmos  there is no appeal 
next solution 
next solution 
we d better take the chance

under the floor  
  that is the mathmos  my child 
  the mathmos 
you really are from earth 
you don t understand 
  no 
  the mathmos   
the whole city is built over a lake 
a very curious lake  composed like
you and i  of living energy   
   but energy in liquid form 
and it wtches us 
it is magnetic  being positively charged 
it feeds on negative psychic vibrations 
what you would call   evil   
it thrives on evil thoughts 
deeds and flesh 
in return  it gives us wrmth 
light and life itseif 
but it has a terrible appetite 
perhaps you ll see some other time 
pygar  pygar 
don t be concerned 
you ll see him again soon 
now  if you ll just come this way

only the black queen knows
the whereabouts of duran duran 
her one vuinerable moment is when
she s in her secret chamber of dreams 
  chamber of dreams 
  yes 
she sleeps alone in a room
above the mathmos   
    surrounded by a wll of energy 
to which she has a secret key 
there is  however  a second key 
which is now in my possession 
you want to find duran duran 
i want to capture the black queen 
you follow my meaning 
if you really have a second key 
why haven t you used it already  
because our forces
are not yet strong enough 
to capture the black queen 
we need to have a military coup 
we can do this with your
weaponry and spacecraft 
get control of the black queen and
you ll know where to find duran duran 
  yes  i  see

  you will soon see  my dear 
  sonata for executioner
and various young women   
it s    sort of nice  isn t it 
yes  lt is nice    in the beginning 
wait until the tune changes 
it may change your tune as well 
goodness  what do you mean 
when we reach the crescendo 
you will die    of pleasure 
your end will be swift 
but sweet    very sweet 
what is this  i don t believe it 
it couldn t be 
wretched girl    what have you done
to my excessive machine 
you ve undone it 
you ve undone me  look  look 
energy cables are shrinking 
you ve turned them into faggots 
you ve burned out the excessive
machine  you ve blown all its fuses 
my goodness 
you ve exhausted its power 
it couldn t keep up with you 
incredible  what kind of girl are you 
have you no shame 
shame  shame on you 
you ll pay for this 
i ve got something for you 
you ll wish you had died of pleasure

beyond all known philosophies 
wait until i  get my devices 
duran duran 
oh  recognized me 
recognized you 
i d never have recognized you  i  thought
you were only 25  what happened 
  the mathmos is not without its effect 
  but you ve aged 30 years 
the mathmos has its own means of
nourishment  in return  it teaches truth 
dr  duran  could you hand me
a garment 
the president of the republic of earth
sent me here to save you 
  and to return you to earth 
  earth planet  never 
shall i tell you why  
because i know too much 
here in sogo i have learned
truth and essence 
i speak of the dignity 
the nobility of pure evil 
my boots  please 
humanism  morals  principles    
lt s rubbish  nonsense 
i speak only of truth and of essence 
  where is the positronic ray  
  so  that s it 
what does it do 
all persons and objects within its path
are de miniminized to the 4th level 
  you mean    
  that s right 
replaced in the
4th dimension irretrievably 
  but that s monstrous 
  yes  it is  lsn t it 
why didn t you take power
here in sogo 
the black queen
must first be destroyed 
but as you know  she is always
surrounded by her black guards 
whoever succeeds in killing her will
be put immediately to a horrible death 
hence  my prudence 
i find horrible the idea that one could do
to me that which i do to others 
but i was told the black queen
is vuinerable while she sleeps 
oh  yes  there are no black guards
in the chamber of dreams 
that s because there s
no access to the chamber 
but  now s time for my pleasure   
and your death 
wait 
i know how you can enter
the chamber of dreams 
  how   speak 
  i  have the key 
  what does it look like 
  it s invisible 
take me to the chamber of dreams 
after you  barbarella 
to the right  barbarella    
now  to the left   
stop 
open it 
  this must be the invisible wll 
  yes  now  where s the key  
  come on  stop stalling 
  i m trying to find the keyhole 
you re trapped  you re trapped
in the chamber of dreams 
  the mathmos will devour you 
  your majesty 
it s no use  l ve got the two keys 
the wll s sealed for all eternity 
dr  duran  give up this madness 
  return to earth with me now 
  i ll return to earth  but as its conqueror 
thanks to you  the queen 
my last obstacle  has been removed 
thank you  barbarella 
nothing can stop me now 
today  master of sogo   
tomorrow  master of the earth  master
of the galaxy  master of the universe 
tell me  my fine  feathered friend 
what do you think of   
   when you make love to barbarella 
an angel doesn t make love 
an angel is love 
wake up  your majesty 
you must wke up 
vade retro  earthgirl 
i know you don t really exist 
that may be  your majesty 
but we d better stick to what we see 
wretched girl  what have you done 
no one must enter while i sleep 
your concierge is
taking over the throne 
  what are you saying 
  it s true  he s taken your key 
  we re locked in  your majesty 
  the key  he s stolen the key 
we are doomed    doomed 
he said the mathmos would devour us 
what did he mean 
it is said that unless i  am alone
in my chamber of dreams   
   the mathmos will claim me 
  it s the throne room 
  i  can see all of the city and labyrinth 
unfortunately  it s a one way screen 
no one can see
that bloody dog has locked me in 
your majesty  we re under attack 
the creatures in the labyrinth 
they re revolting 
how dare he interrupt my coronation 
dispatch the air armada 
quick  your majesty  the labyrinth 
it s dildano  he will save us

all is lost 
i must die  very well  but it is i
who shall have the last laugh 
the imbecile doesn t know
the secret of the great tyrant 
the supreme weapon 
i shall free the mathmos 
  do you think that s wise 
  sogo will disappear 
it will be the end  the apocalypse 
  where are we 
  in the mathmos  and alive 
i can see that  but why  
the mathmos created this bubble
to protect itseif from your innocence 
that s nice

i ll destroy you with my positronic ray 
you re so good 
you make the mathmos vomit 
pygar  what did you do to pygar  
he was sent to the mathmos  but was
no more digestible than you are 
you can t be dead 
you win  barbarella  but the earth
has lost its last great dictator 
the genius of the positronic ray   
why don t you give him
a mouth to mouth 
i have a better idea 
please    pygar  please
