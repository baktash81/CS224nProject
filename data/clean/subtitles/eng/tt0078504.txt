the genius who created me only
took care of my dashing good looks   
   my razor sharp wit and my irresistible
attraction to the wrong women 
what he forgot to add   
was a heart 
but    everyone has a heart 
alas  everyone but yours truly 
hello 
nobody home in soulville 
rid of you 
free from your posterior prison 
you hulking she devil 
don t hear ya laughing now 
we were abandoned here when
this park went  el foldo   
ah  it was a sad day 
there s not much amusement to
the closing down of an amusement park 
but yours truly is an old trooper 
i quickly made plans
for the future 
but alas  i was felled
by my 4th wife  teenie 
crushed in my prime 
there  how does that feel 
but that s the whole
tragic point  my friends 
  what would i do  
  if i could suddenly feel  
  and to know once again  
  that what i feel is real  
  i could cry
i could smile  
  i might lay back
for a while  
    tell me what  
    what  
  what would i do  
  if i could feel  
  what would i do  
  if i could
reach inside of me  
  and to know
how it feels to say  
  i like what i see  
  and i d be more  
  than glad to share  
  all that i have
inside of here  
  and the songs
my heart might bring  
  you d be more
than glad to sing  
  and if tears should
fall from my eyes  
  just think of all the wounds
they could mend  
  and just think of all the time
i could spend  
  just being vulnerable again  
    tell me what  
    what  
  what would i do  
    oh  tell me what  
    what  what would i do  
    oh  tell me what  
    what  
  what would i do  
  if i could feel   
i m just a miserable
hunk of junk 
me 
once the fastest
metal mouth on the midway 
frozen    ironically in a position
i had assumed all too often 
a seat cushion for teenie

  flowers and butterflies  
  a rainbow lives beside it  
  and from a velvet sky  
  the summer storm  
  you can feel  
  the coolness in the air  
  but you re still  
  warm  
  and then a mighty roar  
  will start the sky  
  to cryin   
  but not even lightning  
  will be frightening  
  my lion  
  and with no fear inside  
  no need to run  
  no need to hide

  and tall

politician from district seven 
 public office is the last refuge
of the incompetent    penrose 
incompetent 
ha ha ha 
that s me 
i m incompetent 
so much so  i could never
get elected to public office 
not because i didn t try 
i tried everything 
look  look 
i ran for everything 
alderman  councilman 
assembly leader 
i became a laughingstock 
i couldn t even get on the ticket 
finally  in desperation 
i ran for dogcatcher 
i like animals 
don t get me wrong 
i was at the end of my rope 
i plunged myself into the campaign 
one desperate grandstand play 
you know what i did 
i rented a hot air balloon 
hot air 
that s a perfect vehicle for you 
no  no  no 
it was a beautiful
fourth of july day 
i planned to fly over
the boardwalk and the beach   
   and throw my   
aaah 
throw my leaflets to
the astonished crowds below 
my motto was   
 vote for smith 
your best bet to catch that pet   
but just when i got
up in the balloon   
a terrible storm came up   
   and blew me into the clouds 
i got lost 
i landed here in oz 
they d never seen a hot air
balloon like mine before 
and i know i should have
told them the truth   
   but they proclaimed me
the wizard   
   and i needed the job 
and you mean   
   you sent us to kill evillene   
   knowing    we might
never come back 
she would ve killed me 
she would ve found out
i had no power  and took over oz 
that s no excuse 
come on 
please  please don t go 
i live   
i live here all alone   
   in terror   
   that someone will find out   
   that i m a fraud 
please   
   just stay with me for
a little while and talk 
you can talk to me crazy   
   call me names 
what s the matter 
now i ll never get my brain 
nor my heart 
or my courage 
but you don t need them now   
   because you ve had them all along 
scarecrow  scarecrow 
you re the one who figured out
how to find the yellow brick road   
   and how to destroy evillene   
   and every smart move we ve made 
didn t you 
didn t you 
and  lion   
   you wouldn t even give up when
evillene strung you up by your tail 
and  tin man   
   you have more heart
than anyone i ve ever known 
honest 
yes 
you never needed anything
from the fake wizard anyway 
  if you believe  
  within your heart
you ll know  
  that no one can change  
  the path that you must go  
  believe what you feel  
  and know you re right because  
  the time will come around  
  when you say it s yours  
  believe there s
a reason to be  
  believe you can
make time stand still  
  you know from
the moment you try  
  if you believe  
  i know you will  
  believe in yourself  
  right from the start  
  you ll have brains  
  you ll have a heart  
  you ll have courage  
  to last your
whole life through  
  if you believe
in yourself  
  if you believe
in yourself  
  if you believe
in yourself  
  as i believe in you   
what about you  dorothy 
you ll never get home 
me 
i guess you re stuck
with toto and me 
it s glinda 
the good witch of the south 
she has great powers 
hello  dorothy 
please  is there a way
for me to get home 
dorothy  you were wise
and good enough   
   to help your friends find
what was inside them all the time 
that s true for you  also 
home 
inside me 
i don t understand 
home is a place
we all must find  child 
it s not just a place
where you eat or sleep 
home is knowing 
knowing your mind 
knowing your heart   
   knowing your courage 
if we know ourselves 
we re always home  anywhere 
  if you believe  
  within your heart
you ll know  
  that no one can change  
  the path that you must go  
  believe what you feel  
  and know you re right because  
  the time will come around  
  when you ll say it s yours  
  believe that you
can go home  
  believe you can
float on air  
  yes  click your heels
three times  
  if you believe  
  and then
you ll be there  
  that s why i want you
to believe in yourself  
  yes  right
from the start  
  you ve got to believe  
  believe in the magic
right there in your heart  
  go ahead
believe all these things  
  not because
i told you to  
  now  go ahead
and believe  
  believe in yourself  
  ooh  yeah  believe  
  believe in yourself
ooh  yeah  
  yeah  yeah
believe in yourself  
  as i believe in you   
you mean 
i could have gone home   
   by clicking my heels three times 
uh huh 
dorothy 
can you do something for me 
they ve had what they ve been
searching for in them all along 
i don t know what s in you 
you ll have to find
that out for yourself 
but i do know one thing 
you ll never find it
in the safety of this room 
i tried that all my life 
it doesn t work 
there s a whole world out there 
and you ll have to begin   
   by letting people see
who you really are 
success   
   fame and fortune   
   they re all illusions 
all there is that is real   
   is the friendship   
   that two can share 
that s beautiful 
who said that 
i did 
oh  dorothy 
i ll think of you all the time 
and i will miss you   
   every day 
even if i had to
go back to that junk pile   
   even as teenie s seat cushion 
i wouldn t mind   
   because i have known real love 
oh  don t rust yourself  now 
oh  dorothy 
if it hadn t been for you   
i d still be back
on that pedestal   
   afraid to live 
me  too 
thank you 
thank you 
thank you for
being my friends 
thank you for
being my friends 
i m ready now 
think of home 
home 
  when i think of home  
  i think of a place  
  where there s
love overflowin   
  i wish i was home  
  i wish i was
back there  
  with the things
i ve been knowin   
  wind that makes
the tall trees  
  bend into leaning  
  suddenly the snowflakes
that fall have a meaning  
  sprinkling the scene  
  makes it all clean  
  maybe there s a chance
for me to go back  
  now that i have
some direction  
  it would sure be nice
to be back home  
  where there s
love and affection  
  and just maybe i can
convince time to slow up  
  givin  me enough time
in my life to grow up  
  time  be my friend  
  let me start again  
  suddenly my world s gone
and changed its face  
  but i still
know where i m goin   
  i have had my mind
spun around in space  
  and yet i ve
watched it growin   
  and if you re
listenin   god  
  please don t
make it hard  
  to know if we should believe
the things that we see  
  tell us
should we run away  
  should we try and stay  
  or would it be better
just to let things be  
  livin  here
in this brand new world  
  might be a fantasy  
  but it taught me to love  
  so it s real
real to me  
  and i ve learned  
  that we must
look inside our hearts  
  to find  
  a world full of love  
  like yours  like mine  
  like home
