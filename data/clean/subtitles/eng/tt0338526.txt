a pity your moment of triumph
is being spoiled
over a little thing
like grave robbery
yes
pants i must escape this place
dracula where are you going to run
victor
your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome
in most of the civilized world
ill take him away far away
where no one will ever find him
dracula no no victor
the time has come
for me to take command of him
what are you saying
why do you think i brought you here
gave you this castle
equipped your laboratory
you said
you said you believed in my work
and i do
but now that it is
as you yourself have said
a triumph of science
over god
it must now serve my purpose
what purpose
good god
i would kill myself
before helping in such a task
feel free i dont actually need you
anymore victor
i just need him
he is the key
i could never allow him
to be used for such evil
i could
in fact
my brides are insisting upon it
loud angry snarl
igor help me
igor you have been
so kind to me doctor
caring thoughtful
but he pays me
victor stay back
you cant kill me victor
im already dead
dr frankenstein
look its headed for the windmill
come on
burn it burn it down
vampires
run for your lives
vampires
father
van helsing evening
youre a big one
youll be hard to digest
id hate to be such a nuisance
i missed you in london
no you bloody did not
you got me good
dr jekyll youre wanted
by the knights of the holy order
its mr hyde now
for the murder of 12 men
six women four
children three goats and
a rather nasty massacre of poultry
so youre the great van helsing
and youre a deranged psychopath
we all have our little problems
my superiors would like for me
to take you alive
so that they may extricate
your better half
grunts i bet they bloody would
personally id rather just kill you
and call it a day
but lets make it your decision
shall we
do lets
mr hyde here i come
ready or not
mr hyde no no
ill bet thats upsetting
paris
come here
i think youll find the view
over here rather spectacular
its been a pleasure knowing you
au revoir
oh no
my turn
may he rest in peace
van helsing
you murderer
bless me father for i have
cardinal sinned yes i know
youre very good at that
you shattered the rose window
not to split hairs sir
but mr hyde did the shattering
13th century over 600 years old
i wish you a week in hell for that
it would be a nice reprieve
dont get me wrong
your results are unquestionable
but your methods
attract far too much attention
wanted posters
we are not pleased
do you think i like being
the most wanted man in europe
why dont you and the order
do something about it
because we do not exist
well then neither do i
cardinal when we found you crawling up
the steps of this church halfdead
it was clear to all of us that
you had been sent to do gods work
why cant he do it himself
dont blaspheme
you already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins
cardinal if you wish to recover it
i suggest you continue
to heed the call
without us
the world would be in darkness
governments and empires
come and go
but we have kept mankind safe
since time immemorial
cardinal we are the last defense
against evil
cardinal an evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists
to you these monsters are
just evil beings to be vanquished
im the one standing there
when they die
and become the men they once were
for you my good son
this is all a test of faith
and now
we need you to go to the east
to the far side of romania
an accursed land
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures
cardinal lorded over
by a certain count dracula
van helsing dracula
cardinal yes
youve never faced one
like this before
our story begins 450 years ago
when a transylvanian knight
named valerious the elder
promised god that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven
until they vanquished dracula
from their land
they have not succeeded
and they are running out of family
cardinal his descendant boris valerious
king of the gypsies
he disappeared almost 12 months ago
cardinal his only son prince velkan
and his daughter princess anna
cardinal if the two of them are killed
before dracula is vanquished
nine generations of their family
will never enter
the gates of st peter
for more than four centuries
this family has defended
our left flank
they gave their lives
we cannot let them
slip into purgatory
so youre sending me into hell
in a manner
valerious the elder left this here
400 years ago
we dont know its purpose
but he would not have
left it lightly
the latin inscription translates as
in the name of god
open this door
there is an insignia
yes it matches your ring
i think that in transylvania
you may find the answer you seek
carl faster please faster
faster faster faster
getting there
carl
there you are
did you bring mr hyde back
or did you kill him
you killed him didnt you
thats why they get so annoyed
when they ask you to bring someone
back they dont mean as a corpse
carl all right youre in a mood
come on
i have some things thatll
put the bit back in your mouth
any idiot can make a sword
sorry father
van helsing come along carl
carl here take this
rings of garlic holy water
silver stake crucifix
why cant i have one of those
youve never gone after vampires
before now have you
vampires gargoyles warlocks
theyre all the same
van helsing best when cooked well
no theyre not all the same
a vampire is nothing like a warlock
my granny could kill a warlock
carl youve never even been
out of the abbey
how do you know about vampires
i read
heres something new
glycerin 48
carl sorry
mullah what in allahs name
is wrong with you
the air around here
is thick with envy
this is my latest invention
its gaspropelled
capable of catapulting arrows
in rapid succession
at tremendous velocity
just pull the trigger and hold on
ive heard the stories
from transylvania
trust me youll need this
a work of certifiable genius
lf you dont say so yourself
no i did say so myself
im a veritable cornucopia
of talent
did you invent this
ive been working on that
for 12 years
its compressed magma
from mt vesuvius
with pure alkaline
from the gobi desert
its one of a kind
whats it for
i dont know
but im sure itll come in handy
twelve years
and you dont know what it does
i didnt say that
i said i didnt know what its for
what it does
is to create a light source
equal to the intensity of the sun
this will come in handy how
i dont know
you can blind your enemies
charbroil a herd
of charging wildebeest
use your imagination
no im gonna use yours
thats why youre coming with me
carl holy hell be damned i am
van helsing you cursed
not very well but youre a monk
you shouldnt curse at all
actually im still just a friar
i can curse all i want
damn it
the cardinal has ordered you
to keep me alive
for as long as possible
but im not a field man
carl i dont want to go to transylvania
come on
dracula unleashed you for a reason
pull me up
its stuck
no anna it will kill you
thats my brother out there
cut the rope cut it now
velkan
my gun find my gun
find velkans gun
it has to be the silver bullets
anna hurry
hurry
move
velkan anna look out
run
velkan
god
help us
carl so what do you remember
van helsing not now carl
there must be something
i remember fighting the romans
at masada
that was in 73 ad
you asked
carl what are we doing here
why is it so important
to kill this dracula anyway
because hes the son of the devil
i mean besides that
if we kill him anything bitten
or created by him will also die
i mean besides that
welcome to transylvania
is it always like this
pretty much
anna you turn around
let me see your faces
why
because we dont trust strangers
strangers dont last long here
57 by 23
gentlemen you will now be disarmed
you can try
anna you refuse to obey our laws
the laws of men mean little to me
fine
kill them
im here to help you
i dont need any help
really
everybody inside
hide the children
lntense instrumental music
van helsing stay here
you stay here
theyre trying to kill me
marishka kill the stranger
love to
anna run
carl its not working
carl try aiming at their hearts
its the sun
van helsing
do you like to fly anna
hello anna
nice to see you too aleera
did i do something to you
in a past life
dont play coy with me princess
i know what lurks
in your lusting heart
i hope you have a heart aleera
because someday im going to drive
a stake through it
carl this should do the trick
holy water
stop your teasing marishka
and finish him
too bad so sad
the church
thirty years old
perfectly aged
hello anna my dear
the last of the valerious
i can feel fresh blood
rushing through her veins
here she comes
i want first bite
villager 1 he killed a bride
villager 2 he killed marishka
villager 3 you killed marishka
villager 4 you killed a vampire
carl but isnt that a good thing
vampires only kill what they need
to survive
one or two people a month
now they will kill for revenge
are you always this popular
pretty much
so what name my good sir
do i carve on your gravestone
his name is van helsing
your reputation precedes you
next time stay close
youre no good to me dead
well ill say this for you
youve got courage
hes the first one to kill a vampire
in over 100 years
id say thats earned him a drink
marishka
dracula why cant they just
leave us alone
we never kill more than our fill
and less than our share
can they say the same
did i not stress
how important it was
to be finished
with anna valerious
before she destroys
what we are trying to create
verona we lost marishka
aleera master
there there my darlings
do not worry
i shall find another bride
what
do we mean so little to you
have you no heart
no i have no heart i feel no love
nor fear
nor joy
nor sorrow
i am hollow
and i will live forever
my lord
it is not so bad
dracula i am at war with the world
and every living soul in it
but soon
the final battle will begin
i must go and find out
who our new visitor is
you will have to make
a little ap√©ritif out of him
we are much too close to success
to be interrupted now
aleera no
verona the last experiment was a failure
please say you will not try again
my heart could not bear the sorrow
if we fail again
come
dracula do not fear me
everybody else fears me
not my brides
dracula lgor
yes master
why do you torment that thing so
its what i do
remember lgor do unto others
before they do unto me master
now go all of you
to castle frankenstein
aleera yes we will try again
so how did you get here
we came by sea
anna really the sea
carl well yes
anna the adriatic sea
van helsing where do i find dracula
anna he used to live in this very house
four centuries ago
no one knows where he lives now
father would stare at that painting
for hours
iooking for draculas lair
anna so thats why youve come
van helsing i can help you
no one can help me
i can try
you can die trying
all of my family has
anna i can handle this myself
van helsing so i noticed
the vampires attacked in daylight
they never do that
i was unprepared
it wont happen again
so why did they attack in daylight
clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard
they seem almost desperate
to finish off my family
why is that why now
you ask a lot of questions
usually i ask only two
what are we dealing with
how do i kill it
my father spent most of his life
looking for answers year after year
tearing through the tower
combing through the family archives
carl the tower start there
right
the only way to save your family is
to stay alive till draculas killed
and who will kill him if not me
who will show courage if not me
go alone and youll be outmanned
and outpositioned
and you cant see in the dark
in the morning we will hunt him
but well do it together
some say youre a murderer
mr van helsing
others say youre a holy man
which is it
its a bit of both i think
i promised you a drink
yes you did
the bar is down the hall
help yourself
anna as for me im going to finish this
once and for all
van helsing sorry youve to carry
this burden alone
on the contrary
i would wish for it no other way
im sorry about your father
and brother
i will see them again
we transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death
theres a brighter side of death
yes its just harder to see
im sorry about that too
van helsing
van helsing
velkan
anna
oh my god youre alive
no anna i only have a moment
anna but theres a werewolf
velkan listen to me
i know draculas secret
he has a
anna velkan
velkan please
no
run anna
van helsing anna
are you all right
anna
why does it smell
like wet dog in here
werewolf
right youll be needing
silver bullets then
van helsing well done
whos hunting whom
nice night
this is a bit tight for me
but for you its a perfect fit
top hat what a coincidence
top hat i see the wolf man
hasnt killed you yet
van helsing dont worry hes getting to it
van helsing you dont seem bothered
top hat im no threat to him
im just the one
who cleans up after him
if you get my meaning
little late to be digging graves
isnt it
never too late to dig graves
you never know
when youll need a fresh one
oh sorry its just my nature
move
no
van helsing why
anna youre choking me
give me a reason not to
i cant if people knew
hes not your brother anymore anna
you knew
yes
before or after i stopped you
from shooting him
before
and still you tried to kill him
hes a werewolf
hes gonna kill people
he cant help it
its not his fault
i know but hell do it anyway
do you understand forgiveness
yes i ask for it often
they say dracula has a cure
if theres a chance
i can save my brother
im going after it
no
i need to find dracula
and i need to find my brother
he gave his life for me
hes the only family i have left
i despise dracula
more than you can ever imagine
he has taken everything from me
leaving me alone in this world
to have memories
of those you loved and lost
is perhaps harder
than to have no memories at all
all right
well look for your brother
igor
yes master
how long before we are ready
soon master very soon
it is difficult
without the good doctor
but the dwergi they are doing well
no
good
anna for me this is all personal
its all about family and honour
why do you do it this job of yours
what do you hope to get out of it
i dont know
maybe some selfrealization
what have you got out of it so far
nightmares
werewolves only shed
before the first full moon
before the curse
has completely consumed them
van helsing what is this place
anna castle frankenstein
anna but it should be abandoned
i dont understand
the man who lived here
was killed a year ago
a grave robber among other things
a year ago
it was just after that
that your father went missing
anna yes he was looking for dracula
he was on his way to the sea
i have never been to the sea
ill bet its beautiful
werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon
so hard to control
i send you on a simple errand
to find out
who our new visitor is
and you have to stop
for a little chat with your sister
leave her out of this count
she doesnt know your secret
and i am soon to take it
to my grave
dracula dont wish for death so quickly
i intend for you to be quite useful
velkan i would rather die than help you
dont be boring
everyone who says that dies
besides tonight
after the final stroke
of midnight
you will have no choice
but to obey me
look familiar
father
no
he proved useless
but im hoping with werewolf venom
running through your veins
you will be of greater benefit
i may have failed to kill you
count but my sister will not
velkan never
anna dwergi
van helsing dwergi
draculas servants
industrious but extremely vicious
if you get the chance to kill one
do it
because theyll do worse to you
right
they say theyre using my brother
in some sort of experiment
my brother is still battling
the sickness within him
theres still hope
anna
there is no hope for your brother
but we can still protect others
by killing dracula
let us begin
igor no slacking up
van helsing you ever see these things
anna no
anna what do you think they are
van helsing offspring
anna what
van helsing a man with
three gorgeous women for 400 years
yes vampires are the walking dead
it only makes sense
their children are born dead
hes obviously trying
to bring them to life
clears throat ladies first
dracula and his brides only kill
one or two people a month
if he brings
all these things to life
dracula throw the switches
igor yes master
what are you doing
i want to see what were up against
so this is what you get
when vampires mate
come on
they need to feed
teach them how teach them
and beg the devil
that this time they stay alive
this is where i come in
no wait
now that i have your attention
carl yes well thats interesting
strange low howling
thats not good must warn somebody
i can tell the character of a man
by the sound of his heartbeat
usually when i approach
i can almost dance to the beat
strange that yours is so steady
igor hurry up
igor we must keep
the atmosphere electrified
accelerate the generators
power the dynamos
we are losing power
the human is insufficient
velkan
oh my god
feed my darlings feed
may he rest in peace
hello gabriel
we must not lose
the masters progeny
is this your silver stake
how long has it been
300 400 years
you dont remember do you
exactly what is it
i should be remembering
you are the great van helsing
trained by monks and mullahs
from tibet to istanbul
protected by rome herself
but like me hunted by all others
the knights of the holy order
know all about you
its no surprise
you would know about me
yes but its much more than this
we have such history
you and i gabriel
dracula have you ever wondered why
you have such horrible nightmares
horrific scenes
of ancient battles past
how do you know me
velkan
anna
no dont unstrap me
dont unstrap me
no you must not no stop
stop it
im getting you out of here
velkan its all right
im taking you home
so would you like me
to refresh your memory a little
a few details from your sordid past
perhaps that is a conversation
for another time
allow me to reintroduce myself
i am count vladislaus dragulia
born 1422
murdered 1462
help me
i think
weve overstayed our welcome
man 1 have you found the children
man 2 not yet
what happened
they just died
how can i ever repay you
but you cant do that
you are a monk
well actually im just a friar
igor i am sorry master
we try and we try
but i fear we are not so smart
as dr frankenstein
truly
it would appear the good doctor
took the key to life to his grave
hunt them down
kill them both
anna a silver stake a crucifix
anna what did you think
we havent tried everything before
anna weve shot him stabbed him
clubbed him
sprayed him with holy water
staked him through the heart
and still he lives
do you understand
no one knows how to kill dracula
well i could have used
that information a little earlier
dont give me that look
you were right im sorry
hes not my brother anymore
do you have any family
mr van helsing
not sure
i hope to find out someday
thats what keeps me going
heres to what keeps you going
absinthe strong stuff
dont let it touch your tongue
itll knock you on your
vampire
vampires
now i remember
even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night
may become a wolf
when the wolfbane blooms
and the moon is shining bright
or crave anothers blood
when the sun goes down
and his body takes to flight
clock chiming
theres something down here
van helsing and its carnivorous
van helsing whatever it is
it appears to be human
id say hes a size 17
around 360 pounds
85 to 9 feet tall
he has a bad gimp in his right leg
and three copper teeth
how do you know he has copper teeth
because hes standing
right behind you move
oh my god
the frankenstein monster
monster whos the monster here
i have done nothing wrong
and yet you and your kind
all wish me dead
what do you want
to exist
dont
we must kill it
wait
if you value your lives
and the lives of your kind
you will kill me
no
if dracula finds me
i am the key to my fathers machine
the key to life
life for draculas children
he already awakened them last night
frankenstein two
and those were from only one bride
from one single birthing
and they died
as they did the last time he tried
only with me
can he give them lasting life
there are more
more of those things
thousands
thousands more
van helsing no
anna you heard what he said
my life my job is to vanquish evil
i can sense evil
van helsing this thing man
whatever it is
evil may have created it
may have left its mark on it
but evil does not rule it
so i cannot kill it
i can
not while im here
anna
your family has spent 400 years
trying to kill dracula
maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way
oh my god hes seen us
now theyll come for him
neither you nor i
will be able to stop them
if i can get him to rome
we can protect him there
and then the painting came alive
and the two creatures
attacked each other
what does it mean
i dont know
listen carl whatever you do
dont stare at him
im staring at him
is that a man
van helsing actually seven men
parts anyway
by exposing me
you have condemned me
me and all of humanity
nothing is faster
than transylvanian horses
not even a werewolf
anything else youre on your own
let me go
where are you going to go
i dont know
if youve seen a mirror lately
but you kind of stick out
in a crowd
we must not let the creature
be destroyed
save him save the monster
verona stakes
no
carl oh my god
what are you doing out here
right
dont let go
i can help
you wont kill me
only if you dont hurry
jump
velkan
anna
forgive me
i will see you again
anna you killed him
now you know
why they call me murderer
oh my god
youve been bitten
anna
anna
so much trouble to my master
so much trouble
what do you want
aleera the master commands a trade
the monster for the princess
somewhere public lots of people
a place where your master
will be less inclined
to expose his other side
tomorrow night is all hallows eve
here in budapest there is
a wonderful masquerade ball
are you all right
no
he has been bitten
frankenstein bitten by a werewolf
now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately
i am sorry
may others be as passionate
in their hunting of you
van helsing well
they wont find him in here
im sure this is some sort of sin
van helsing god will forgive us
we need to save anna
you dont think
the hats a bit much
van helsing carl help me
carl right
carl how many commandments
can we break in one day
carl anyway according to the book
you wont turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon
carl thats two nights from now
carl youll still be able
to fight draculas hold over you
until the final stroke of midnight
van helsing so i have nothing
to worry about
carl my god you should be terrified
van helsing thanks
carl sorry
carl we still have 48 hours
to find a solution
you sure he cant get out of there
van helsing not without
some help from the dead
how does it feel
to be a puppet on my string
i wont let you trade me count
i have no intention of trading you
dracula and if i know van helsing
which i do
he is not planning on
making a trade either
neither of us
has ever settled for half
there they are
you make my skin crawl
this is not all i could do
with your skin
carl i need you to do something
im not gonna like this am i
dracula dont we make a lovely couple
oh my god
dracula i am looking
for a new bride anna
someone strong and beautiful
one brief moment of pain
and we can be together forever
you have no heartbeat
dracula perhaps it just needs
to be rekindled
anna anna
van helsing wake up
dracula gabriel
oh gabriel
welcome to my summer palace
master look master
we have him master
we have him
you wretched undead
i shall have my revenge
though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death
i shall fear no evil
you are nothing but damned bones
and damned souls
and will burn in the flames of hell
now that everything
is as it should be
ladies and gentlemen
i give to you
van helsing
come on
yes
now i know what its for
where are we going
through that window
carl youre a genius
a genius with access
to unstable chemicals
say goodbye to your friends
ill find you
ill get you back and set you free
i swear to god
i must save him
no you cant
why
i cabled rome earlier
to apprise them of our situation
what did they say
carl even if you kill dracula
rome orders you to destroy
frankenstein as well
he isnt evil
but they say he isnt human either
do they know him have they spoken
to him who are they to judge
they want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity
what of me did you tell them
what im to become
van helsing did they tell you
how to kill me
the correct angle of the stake
as it enters my heart
the exact measure of silver
in each bullet
anna stop
carl no i left you out
im sorry
its starting
they must have taken
all the equipment to draculas lair
wherever that is
look theres still time
dracula cant bring his children
to life until the sun sets
the sun sets in two hours
weve been looking for him
for more than 400 years
yes well i wasnt around
for those 400 years now was i
van helsing okay carl
what have you learned
that count dracula was actually
the son of valerious the elder
the son of your ancestor
everybody knows that what else
all right
well according to this rubbing
it all started
when dracula was murdered
van helsing do you know
who murdered him
carl no theres just some vague reference
to the left hand of god
and in 1462 when dracula died
he made a covenant with the devil
and was given a new life
but the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood
excuse me are you going to
let me tell the story
both sorry
and your ancestor
having sired this evil creature
went to rome to seek forgiveness
thats when the bargain was made
he was to kill dracula
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family
right down the line
all the way to you
anna but he couldnt do it
as evil as dracula was my ancestor
couldnt kill his own son
so he banished him
to an icy fortress
sending him through a door
from which there was no return
and then the devil gave him wings
yes
all right so where is this door
i dont know
but when your ancestor couldnt
kill his son he left clues
so that future generations
might do it for him
that must be what my father
was looking for in here
clues to the doors location
the door
of course
you said your father spent hours
staring at this painting
trying to find the lair
i think you were right
quite literally
i think this is the door
he just didnt know how to open it
look a latin inscription
carl maybe it works
like the painting in the tower
if this were a door my father
would have opened it long ago
i cant finish the inscription
theres a piece missing
your father didnt have this
where did you get that
van helsing carl finish it
in the name of god open this door
a mirror
dracula has no reflection
in the mirror
but why
maybe to dracula
its not a mirror at all
its cold and its snowing
van helsing see you on the other side
be careful
castle dracula
carl do we have a plan
carl doesnt have to be
wellingtons at waterloo
but some sort of plan would be nice
van helsing were going to stop dracula
anna and kill anything
in our way
carl well you let me know how that goes
well as grateful as i am
to be out of the cold
that doesnt seem like a good thing
wed better get moving
carl so are all of those
anna yes
and inside them are
yes
igor do this lgor do that
how did you find
its impossible
please dont kill me
why not
well i
my master has awakened
there is a cure
what
dracula he has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf
go find the cure save yourself
anna come on you heard him
lets find it
wait why does dracula have a cure
i dont care
i do
why does he need one why
because the only thing
that can kill him is a werewolf
the painting thats what it meant
anna draculas been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries
yes but if one ever had the will
to turn on him hed need a cure
to remove the curse and
make him human before it bit him
youre going to take these two
and lead them to the antidote
no im not
yes i am
heres the plan when the bell
begins to toll midnight
youll be able to kill dracula
we just need to find the cure
and get it into you
before the final stroke
are you insane
what kind of plan is that
if they even suspect you
of misleading them
clip off one of his fingers
ill clip off something
the tower over there
thats where it is
and what about the other tower
give me that
that is where
we reassembled the laboratory
would i lie to you
not if you wanted to live
now if im not cured by
the twelfth stroke of midnight
i dont think i could
you must
come on
i dont like this plan
we dont have a choice
just dont get killed
you still dont understand
it doesnt matter
what happens to me
we must save my family
if youre late run like hell
dont be late
now go go
frankenstein get off me
you vermin from hell
what are you complaining about
this is why you were made
to prove that god is not
the only one who can create life
and now you must give that life
to my children
up
there it is
ill go first
carl
stay as long as you like
you try to get lgor igor get you
go ahead grab it
you go ahead and grab it
if theres one thing ive learned
its never to be the first to stick
your hand in a viscous material
did i scare you
no
then maybe i need
to try a little harder
viscous material
what did i tell you
get it
hot
come on
yes
weve got to get the antidote
to van helsing go
you cant go until i say you can go
keep running carl
and ill say you can go
when youre dead
carl oh my god
what are you doing
you must find the cure
my friends are doing it for me
friends
yes you want one
i cant unscrew the bolts
this is gonna hurt
i am accustomed to pain
it lets you know youre alive
give me life
one more bolt
and my young will live
van helsing youre almost out my friend
help me
but youre supposed to die
i want to live
all right
be happy in the knowledge
that i shall weep
over your dead body
hang on
ill swing you loose
you are too late my friend
my children live
then the only way to kill them
is to kill you
correct
so be it
one
no this cannot be
we are both part of
the same grand game gabriel
but we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board
aleera shrieks in pain
go go and help van helsing
now
thank you
oh my god
anna i need a little help
hurry
anna throw it to me carl
yes
you are being used gabriel
as was i
but i escaped so can you
aleera anna my love
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful
what do you think of that
i think if youre going to
kill someone kill them
dont stand there talking about it
dont you understand
we could be friends partners
brothersinarms
did i mention that it was you
who murdered me
it must be such a burden
such a curse
to be the left hand of god
all i want is life gabriel
the continuation of my kind
and perhaps the return of my ring
dont be afraid gabriel
dont be afraid
i shall give you back your life
your memory
some things
are better left forgotten
for god
god forgive me
shes dead
carl eternal rest grant unto her
