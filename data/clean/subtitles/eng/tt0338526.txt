a pity your moment of triumph
is being spoiled   
over a little thing
like grave robbery 
yes 
 pants  i must escape this place 
dracula  where are you going to run 
victor 
your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome   
in most of the civilized world 
i ll take him away  far away 
where no one will ever find him 
dracula  no  no  victor 
the time has come
for me to take command of him 
what are you saying 
why do you think i brought you here 
gave you this castle 
  equipped your laboratory 
  you said   
  you said you believed in my work 
  and i do 
but now that it is 
as you yourself have said   
a triumph of science   
over god   
it must now serve my purpose 
what purpose 
good god 
i would kill myself
before helping in such a task 
feel free  i don t actually need you
anymore  victor 
i just need him 
he is the key 
i could never allow him
to be used for such evil 
i could 
in fact 
my brides are insisting upon it 
 loud  angry snarl 
igor  help me 
igor  you have been
so kind to me  doctor   
caring  thoughtful 
but he pays me 
victor  stay back 
you can t kill me  victor 
i m already dead 
dr  frankenstein 
look  it s headed for the windmill 
come on 
burn it  burn it down 
vampires 
  run for your lives 
 vampires 
father 
van helsing  evening 
you re a big one 
you ll be hard to digest 
i d hate to be such a nuisance 
i missed you in london 
no  you bloody did not 
you got me good 
dr  jekyll  you re wanted
by the knights of the holy order   
it s mr  hyde now 
   for the murder of 12 men 
six women  four   
   children  three goats  and
a rather nasty massacre of poultry 
so you re the great van helsing 
and you re a deranged psychopath 
we all have our little problems 
my superiors would like for me
to take you alive   
so that they may extricate
your better half 
 grunts  i bet they bloody would 
personally  i d rather just kill you
and call it a day 
but let s make it your decision 
shall we 
do let s 
mr  hyde  here i come   
ready or not 
mr  hyde  no  no 
i ll bet that s upsetting 
paris 
come here 
i think you ll find the view
over here rather spectacular 
it s been a pleasure knowing you 
au revoir 
oh  no 
my turn 
may he rest in peace 
van helsing 
you murderer 
bless me  father  for i have   
cardinal  sinned  yes  i know 
you re very good at that 
you shattered the rose window 
not to split hairs  sir 
but mr  hyde did the shattering 
13th century  over 600 years old 
  i wish you a week in hell for that 
  it would be a nice reprieve 
don t get me wrong 
your results are unquestionable   
but your methods
attract far too much attention 
 wanted  posters 
we are not pleased 
do you think i like being
the most wanted man in europe 
why don t you and the order
do something about it 
because we do not exist 
well  then neither do i 
cardinal  when we found you crawling up
the steps of this church  half dead   
it was clear to all of us that
you had been sent to do god s work 
  why can t he do it himself 
  don t blaspheme 
you already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins 
cardinal  if you wish to recover it   
i suggest you continue
to heed the call 
without us 
the world would be in darkness 
governments and empires
come and go   
but we have kept mankind safe
since time immemorial 
cardinal  we are the last defense
against evil 
cardinal  an evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists 
to you  these monsters are
just evil beings to be vanquished 
i m the one standing there
when they die   
and become the men they once were 
for you  my good son 
this is all a test of faith 
and now 
we need you to go to the east 
to the far side of romania 
an accursed land   
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures 
cardinal  lorded over
by a certain count dracula 
van helsing  dracula 
cardinal  yes 
you ve never faced one
like this before 
our story begins 450 years ago   
when a transylvanian knight
named valerious the elder   
promised god that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven   
until they vanquished dracula
from their land 
they have not succeeded   
and they are running out of family 
cardinal  his descendant boris valerious 
king of the gypsies 
he disappeared almost 12 months ago 
cardinal  his only son  prince velkan 
and his daughter  princess anna 
cardinal  if the two of them are killed
before dracula is vanquished   
nine generations of their family   
will never enter
the gates of st  peter 
for more than four centuries   
this family has defended
our left flank 
they gave their lives 
we cannot let them
slip into purgatory 
so you re sending me into hell 
in a manner 
valerious the elder left this here
400 years ago 
we don t know its purpose   
but he would not have
left it lightly 
the latin inscription translates as 
 in the name of god 
open this door  
there is an insignia 
yes  it matches your ring 
i think that in transylvania
you may find the answer you seek 
carl  faster  please  faster 
faster  faster  faster 
getting there 
  carl 
  there you are 
did you bring mr  hyde back 
or did you kill him 
you killed him  didn t you 
that s why they get so annoyed 
when they ask you to bring someone
back  they don t mean as a corpse 
carl  all right  you re in a mood 
come on 
i have some things that ll
put the bit back in your mouth 
any idiot can make a sword 
sorry  father 
van helsing  come along  carl 
carl  here  take this 
rings of garlic  holy water   
silver stake  crucifix 
why can t i have one of those 
you ve never gone after vampires
before now  have you 
vampires  gargoyles  warlocks 
they re all the same 
van helsing  best when cooked well 
no  they re not all the same 
a vampire is nothing like a warlock 
my granny could kill a warlock 
carl  you ve never even been
out of the abbey 
  how do you know about vampires 
  i read 
here s something new 
glycerin 48 
carl  sorry 
mullah  what in allah s name
is wrong with you 
the air around here
is thick with envy 
this is my latest invention 
it s gas propelled 
capable of catapulting arrows
in rapid succession   
at tremendous velocity 
just pull the trigger and hold on 
i ve heard the stories
from transylvania 
trust me  you ll need this 
a work of certifiable genius 
  lf you don t say so yourself 
  no  i did say so myself 
i m a veritable cornucopia
of talent 
did you invent this 
i ve been working on that
for 12 years 
it s compressed magma
from mt  vesuvius   
with pure alkaline
from the gobi desert 
  it s one of a kind 
  what s it for 
i don t know 
but i m sure it ll come in handy 
twelve years 
and you don t know what it does 
i didn t say that 
i said i didn t know what it s for 
what it does
is to create a light source   
equal to the intensity of the sun 
this will come in handy how 
i don t know 
you can blind your enemies 
charbroil a herd
of charging wildebeest 
use your imagination 
no  i m gonna use yours 
that s why you re coming with me 
carl  holy hell be damned i am 
van helsing  you cursed 
not very well  but you re a monk 
you shouldn t curse at all 
actually  i m still just a friar 
i can curse all i want   
damn it 
the cardinal has ordered you
to keep me alive 
  for as long as possible 
  but i m not a field man 
carl  i don t want to go to transylvania 
come on 
dracula unleashed you for a reason 
pull me up 
it s stuck 
  no  anna  it will kill you 
  that s my brother out there 
cut the rope  cut it now 
velkan 
my gun  find my gun 
find velkan s gun 
it has to be the silver bullets 
anna  hurry 
hurry 
move 
velkan  anna  look out 
run 
velkan 
god   
help us 
carl  so  what do you remember 
van helsing  not now  carl 
there must be something 
i remember fighting the romans
at masada 
  that was in 73 a d 
  you asked 
carl  what are we doing here 
why is it so important
to kill this dracula  anyway 
  because he s the son of the devil 
  i mean  besides that 
if we kill him  anything bitten
or created by him will also die 
i mean  besides that 
welcome to transylvania 
  is it always like this 
  pretty much 
anna  you  turn around 
  let me see your faces 
  why 
because we don t trust strangers 
strangers don t last long here 
5 7  by 2 3  
gentlemen  you will now be disarmed 
you can try 
anna  you refuse to obey our laws 
  the laws of men mean little to me 
  fine 
kill them 
  i m here to help you 
  i don t need any help 
really 
everybody inside 
hide the children 
 lntense instrumental music 
van helsing  stay here 
you stay here 
they re trying to kill me 
  marishka  kill the stranger 
  love to 
anna  run 
carl  it s not working 
carl  try aiming at their hearts 
it s the sun 
van helsing 
do you like to fly  anna 
hello  anna 
nice to see you  too  aleera 
did i do something to you
in a past life 
don t play coy with me  princess 
i know what lurks
in your lusting heart 
i hope you have a heart  aleera   
because someday i m going to drive
a stake through it 
carl  this should do the trick 
holy water 
stop your teasing  marishka 
and finish him 
too bad  so sad 
the church 
thirty years old 
perfectly aged 
hello  anna  my dear 
the last of the valerious 
i can feel fresh blood
rushing through her veins 
here she comes 
i want first bite 
villager  1  he killed a bride 
villager  2  he killed marishka 
villager  3  you killed marishka 
villager  4  you killed a vampire 
carl  but isn t that a good thing 
vampires only kill what they need
to survive 
one or two people a month 
now they will kill for revenge 
  are you always this popular 
  pretty much 
so what name  my good sir 
do i carve on your gravestone 
his name is van helsing 
your reputation precedes you 
next time stay close 
you re no good to me dead 
well  i ll say this for you 
you ve got courage 
he s the first one to kill a vampire
in over 100 years 
i d say that s earned him a drink 
marishka 
dracula  why can t they just
leave us alone 
we never kill more than our fill
and less than our share 
can they say the same 
did i not stress
how important it was   
to be finished
with anna valerious   
before she destroys
what we are trying to create 
verona  we lost marishka 
aleera  master 
there  there  my darlings 
do not worry 
  i shall find another bride 
  what 
  do we mean so little to you 
  have you no heart 
no  i have no heart  i feel no love 
nor fear   
nor joy   
nor sorrow 
i am hollow 
and i will live forever 
  my lord 
  it is not so bad 
dracula  i am at war with the world   
and every living soul in it 
but soon
the final battle will begin 
i must go and find out
who our new visitor is 
you will have to make
a little apéritif out of him 
we are much too close to success
to be interrupted now 
aleera  no 
verona  the last experiment was a failure 
please  say you will not try again 
my heart could not bear the sorrow
if we fail again 
come 
dracula  do not fear me 
everybody else fears me 
not my brides 
dracula  lgor 
yes  master 
why do you torment that thing so 
it s what i do 
remember  lgor   do unto others    
before they do unto me  master 
now go  all of you 
to castle frankenstein 
aleera  yes  we will try again 
  so  how did you get here 
  we came by sea 
anna  really  the sea 
carl  well  yes 
anna  the adriatic sea 
van helsing  where do i find dracula 
anna  he used to live in this very house
four centuries ago 
no one knows where he lives now 
father would stare at that painting
for hours   
iooking for dracula s lair 
anna  so that s why you ve come 
van helsing  i can help you 
  no one can help me 
  i can try 
you can die trying 
all of my family has 
anna  i can handle this myself 
van helsing  so i noticed 
the vampires attacked in daylight 
they never do that 
i was unprepared 
it won t happen again 
so why did they attack in daylight 
clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard 
they seem almost desperate
to finish off my family 
  why is that  why now 
  you ask a lot of questions 
usually i ask only two 
what are we dealing with 
how do i kill it 
my father spent most of his life
looking for answers year after year 
tearing through the tower 
combing through the family archives 
  carl  the tower  start there 
  right 
the only way to save your family is
to stay alive till dracula s killed 
and who will kill him if not me 
who will show courage if not me 
go alone and you ll be outmanned
and outpositioned 
and you can t see in the dark 
in the morning  we will hunt him   
but we ll do it together 
some say you re a murderer 
mr  van helsing 
others say you re a holy man 
which is it 
it s a bit of both  i think 
  i promised you a drink 
  yes  you did 
the bar is down the hall 
help yourself 
anna  as for me  i m going to finish this
once and for all 
van helsing  sorry you ve to carry
this burden alone 
on the contrary 
i would wish for it no other way 
i m sorry about your father
and brother 
i will see them again 
we transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death 
  there s a brighter side of death 
  yes  it s just harder to see 
i m sorry about that  too 
van helsing 
van helsing 
  velkan 
  anna 
oh  my god  you re alive 
no  anna  i only have a moment 
anna  but there s a werewolf   
velkan  listen to me 
i know dracula s secret 
he has a   
anna  velkan 
velkan  please 
no 
run  anna 
van helsing  anna 
are you all right 
anna 
why does it smell
like wet dog in here 
werewolf 
right  you ll be needing
silver bullets  then 
van helsing  well done 
who s hunting whom 
nice night 
this is a bit tight for me 
but for you it s a perfect fit 
top hat  what a coincidence 
top hat  i see the wolf man
hasn t killed you yet 
van helsing  don t worry  he s getting to it 
van helsing  you don t seem bothered 
top hat  i m no threat to him 
i m just the one
who cleans up after him   
if you get my meaning 
little late to be digging graves 
isn t it 
never too late to dig graves 
you never know
when you ll need a fresh one 
oh  sorry  it s just my nature 
  move 
  no 
van helsing  why 
anna  you re choking me 
  give me a reason not to 
  i can t  if people knew   
he s not your brother anymore  anna 
  you knew 
  yes 
before or after i stopped you
from shooting him 
before 
and still you tried to kill him 
he s a werewolf 
he s gonna kill people 
he can t help it 
it s not his fault 
i know  but he ll do it anyway 
do you understand forgiveness 
yes  i ask for it often 
they say dracula has a cure 
if there s a chance
i can save my brother   
  i m going after it 
  no 
  i need to find dracula 
  and i need to find my brother 
he gave his life for me 
he s the only family i have left 
i despise dracula
more than you can ever imagine 
he has taken everything from me 
leaving me alone in this world 
to have memories
of those you loved and lost   
is perhaps harder
than to have no memories at all 
all right 
we ll look for your brother 
  igor 
  yes  master 
  how long before we are ready 
  soon  master  very soon 
it is difficult
without the good doctor   
but the dwergi  they are doing well 
no 
good 
anna  for me  this is all personal 
it s all about family and honour 
why do you do it  this job of yours 
what do you hope to get out of it 
i don t know 
maybe some self realization 
what have you got out of it so far 
nightmares 
werewolves only shed
before the first full moon 
before the curse
has completely consumed them 
van helsing  what is this place 
anna  castle frankenstein 
anna  but it should be abandoned 
i don t understand 
the man who lived here
was killed a year ago 
  a grave robber  among other things 
  a year ago 
it was just after that
that your father went missing 
anna  yes  he was looking for dracula 
he was on his way to the sea 
i have never been to the sea 
i ll bet it s beautiful 
werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon 
so hard to control 
i send you on a simple errand   
to find out
who our new visitor is   
and you have to stop
for a little chat with your sister 
leave her out of this  count 
she doesn t know your secret 
and i am soon to take it
to my grave 
dracula  don t wish for death so quickly 
i intend for you to be quite useful 
velkan  i would rather die than help you 
don t be boring 
everyone who says that dies 
besides  tonight   
after the final stroke
of midnight   
you will have no choice
but to obey me 
look familiar 
father 
no 
he proved useless 
but i m hoping  with werewolf venom
running through your veins   
you will be of greater benefit 
i may have failed to kill you 
count  but my sister will not 
velkan  never 
anna  dwergi 
van helsing  dwergi 
dracula s servants 
industrious but extremely vicious 
if you get the chance to kill one 
do it   
  because they ll do worse to you 
  right 
they say they re using my brother
in some sort of experiment 
my brother is still battling
the sickness within him 
  there s still hope 
  anna 
there is no hope for your brother 
but we can still protect others
by killing dracula 
let us begin 
igor   no slacking  up   
van helsing  you ever see these things 
anna  no 
anna  what do you think they are 
van helsing  offspring 
anna  what 
van helsing  a man with
three gorgeous women for 400 years 
yes  vampires are the walking dead 
it only makes sense
their children are born dead 
he s obviously trying
to bring them to life 
 clears throat  ladies first 
dracula and his brides only kill
one or two people a month 
if he brings
all these things to life   
dracula  throw the switches 
igor  yes  master 
what are you doing 
i want to see what we re up against 
so this is what you get
when vampires mate 
come on 
they need to feed 
teach them how  teach them 
and beg the devil   
that this time they stay alive 
  this is where i come in 
  no  wait 
now that i have your attention   
carl  yes  well  that s interesting 
 strange low howling 
that s not good  must warn somebody 
i can tell the character of a man
by the sound of his heartbeat 
usually when i approach   
i can almost dance to the beat 
strange that yours is so steady 
igor   hurry up   
igor  we must keep
the atmosphere electrified 
accelerate the generators 
power the dynamos 
we are losing power 
the human is insufficient 
velkan 
oh  my god 
feed  my darlings  feed 
may he rest in peace 
hello  gabriel 
we must not lose
the master s progeny 
is this your silver stake 
how long has it been 
300  400 years 
you don t remember  do you 
exactly what is it
i should be remembering 
you are the great van helsing 
trained by monks and mullahs
from tibet to istanbul 
protected by rome herself 
but  like me  hunted by all others 
the knights of the holy order
know all about you 
it s no surprise
you would know about me 
yes  but it s much more than this 
we have such history 
you and i  gabriel 
dracula  have you ever wondered why
you have such horrible nightmares 
horrific scenes
of ancient battles past 
how do you know me 
  velkan 
  anna 
no  don t unstrap me 
don t unstrap me 
no  you must not  no  stop 
stop it 
i m getting you out of here 
velkan  it s all right 
i m taking you home 
so would you like me
to refresh your memory a little 
a few details from your sordid past 
perhaps that is a conversation
for another time 
allow me to reintroduce myself 
i am count vladislaus dragulia 
born 1422 
murdered 1462 
help me 
i think
we ve overstayed our welcome 
man  1  have you found the children 
man  2  not yet 
  what happened 
  they just died 
how can i ever repay you 
but you can t do that 
you are a monk 
well  actually i m just a friar 
igor  i am sorry  master 
we try and we try   
but i fear we are not so smart
as dr  frankenstein 
truly 
it would appear the good doctor
took the key to life to his grave 
hunt them down 
kill them both 
anna  a silver stake  a crucifix 
anna  what  did you think
we haven t tried everything before 
anna  we ve shot him  stabbed him 
clubbed him   
sprayed him with holy water 
staked him through the heart   
and still he lives 
do you understand 
no one knows how to kill dracula 
well  i could have used
that information a little earlier 
don t give me that look 
you were right  i m sorry 
he s not my brother anymore 
do you have any family 
mr  van helsing 
not sure 
i hope to find out someday 
that s what keeps me going 
  here s to what keeps you going 
  absinthe  strong stuff 
don t let it touch your tongue 
it ll knock you on your   
vampire 
vampires 
now i remember 
 even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night
 may become a wolf
when the wolfbane blooms
 and the moon is shining bright
 or crave another s blood
when the sun goes down
 and his body takes to flight 
 clock chiming 
25 000
there s something down here 
van helsing  and it s carnivorous 
van helsing  whatever it is 
it appears to be human 
i d say he s a size 17 
around 360 pounds 
8 5 to 9 feet tall 
he has a bad gimp in his right leg
and three copper teeth 
how do you know he has copper teeth 
because he s standing
right behind you  move 
oh  my god 
the frankenstein monster 
monster  who s the monster here 
i have done nothing wrong   
and yet you and your kind
all wish me dead 
what do you want 
to exist 
don t 
  we must kill it 
  wait 
if you value your lives
and the lives of your kind   
  you will kill me 
  no 
if dracula finds me   
i am the key to my father s machine 
the key to life 
life for dracula s children 
he already awakened them last night 
frankenstein  two 
and those were from only one bride 
from one single birthing 
and they died
as they did the last time he tried 
only with me
can he give them lasting life 
there are more 
more of those things 
thousands 
thousands more 
van helsing  no 
anna  you heard what he said 
my life  my job is to vanquish evil 
i can sense evil 
van helsing  this thing  man 
whatever it is   
evil may have created it 
may have left its mark on it 
but evil does not rule it 
so i cannot kill it 
  i can 
  not while i m here 
anna 
your family has spent 400 years
trying to kill dracula 
maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way 
oh  my god  he s seen us 
now they ll come for him 
neither you nor i
will be able to stop them 
if i can get him to rome 
we can protect him there 
and then the painting came alive   
and the two creatures
attacked each other 
  what does it mean 
  i don t know 
listen  carl  whatever you do 
don t stare at him 
i m staring at him 
is that a man 
van helsing  actually  seven men 
parts  anyway 
by exposing me 
you have condemned me 
me and all of humanity 
nothing is faster
than transylvanian horses 
not even a werewolf 
anything else  you re on your own 
  let me go 
  where are you going to go 
i don t know
if you ve seen a mirror lately   
but you kind of stick out
in a crowd 
we must not let the creature
be destroyed 
save him  save the monster 
verona  stakes 
no 
carl  oh  my god 
what are you doing out here 
right 
don t let go 
i can help 
you won t kill me 
only if you don t hurry 
jump 
velkan 
anna   
forgive me 
i will see you again 
anna  you killed him 
now you know
why they call me murderer 
oh  my god 
you ve been bitten 
anna 
anna 
so much trouble to my master 
so much trouble 
what do you want 
aleera  the master commands a trade 
the monster for the princess 
somewhere public  lots of people 
a place where your master
will be less inclined   
to expose his other side 
tomorrow night is all hallows  eve 
here in budapest there is
a wonderful masquerade ball 
  are you all right 
  no 
he has been bitten 
frankenstein  bitten by a werewolf 
now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately 
i am sorry 
may others be as passionate
in their hunting of you 
van helsing  well 
they won t find him in here 
i m sure this is some sort of sin 
van helsing  god will forgive us 
we need to save anna 
you don t think
the hat s a bit much 
van helsing  carl  help me 
carl  right 
carl  how many commandments
can we break in one day 
carl  anyway  according to the book   
you won t turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon 
carl  that s two nights from now 
carl  you ll still be able
to fight dracula s hold over you   
until the final stroke of midnight 
van helsing  so i have nothing
to worry about 
carl  my god  you should be terrified 
van helsing  thanks 
carl  sorry 
carl  we still have 48 hours
to find a solution 
you sure he can t get out of there 
van helsing  not without
some help from the dead 
how does it feel
to be a puppet on my string 
i won t let you trade me  count 
i have no intention of trading you 
dracula  and if i know van helsing 
which i do   
he is not planning on
making a trade  either 
neither of us
has ever settled for half 
there they are 
you make my skin crawl 
this is not all i could do
with your skin 
carl  i need you to do something 
i m not gonna like this  am i 
dracula  don t we make a lovely couple 
oh  my god 
dracula  i am looking
for a new bride  anna 
someone strong and beautiful 
one brief moment of pain   
and we can be together forever 
you have no heartbeat 
dracula  perhaps it just needs   
to be rekindled 
anna  anna 
van helsing  wake up 
dracula  gabriel 
oh  gabriel 
welcome to my summer palace 
master  look  master 
we have him  master 
we have him 
you wretched undead   
i shall have my revenge 
 though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death   
 i shall fear no evil  
you are nothing but damned bones   
and damned souls   
and will burn in the flames of hell 
now that everything
is as it should be   
ladies and gentlemen 
i give to you   
van helsing 
come on 
yes 
now i know what it s for 
  where are we going 
  through that window 
carl  you re a genius 
a genius with access
to unstable chemicals 
say goodbye to your friends 
i ll find you 
i ll get you back and set you free 
i swear to god 
  i must save him 
  no  you can t 
why 
i cabled rome earlier
to apprise them of our situation 
what did they say 
carl  even if you kill dracula   
rome orders you to destroy
frankenstein as well 
he isn t evil 
but they say he isn t human  either 
do they know him  have they spoken
to him  who are they to judge 
they want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity 
what of me  did you tell them
what i m to become 
van helsing  did they tell you
how to kill me 
the correct angle of the stake
as it enters my heart 
the exact measure of silver
in each bullet 
anna  stop 
carl  no  i left you out 
i m sorry 
it s starting 
they must have taken
all the equipment to dracula s lair 
wherever that is 
look  there s still time 
dracula can t bring his children
to life until the sun sets 
the sun sets in two hours 
we ve been looking for him
for more than 400 years 
yes  well  i wasn t around
for those 400 years  now  was i 
van helsing  okay  carl 
what have you learned 
that count dracula was actually
the son of valerious the elder 
the son of your ancestor 
everybody knows that  what else 
all right 
well  according to this rubbing   
it all started
when dracula was murdered 
van helsing  do you know
who murdered him 
carl  no  there s just some vague reference
to the left hand of god 
and in 1462  when dracula died   
  he made a covenant with the devil 
  and was given a new life 
but the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood 
excuse me  are you going to
let me tell the story 
both  sorry 
and your ancestor 
having sired this evil creature   
went to rome to seek forgiveness 
that s when the bargain was made 
he was to kill dracula   
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family   
right down the line
all the way to you 
anna  but he couldn t do it 
as evil as dracula was  my ancestor
couldn t kill his own son 
so he banished him
to an icy fortress   
sending him through a door
from which there was no return 
  and then the devil gave him wings 
  yes 
  all right  so where is this door 
  i don t know 
but when your ancestor couldn t
kill his son  he left clues 
so that future generations
might do it for him 
that must be what my father
was looking for in here 
clues to the door s location 
the door 
of course 
you said your father spent hours   
staring at this painting 
trying to find the lair 
i think you were right 
quite literally 
i think this is the door 
he just didn t know how to open it 
look  a latin inscription 
carl  maybe it works
like the painting in the tower 
if this were a door  my father
would have opened it long ago 
i can t finish the inscription 
there s a piece missing 
  your father didn t have this 
  where did you get that 
van helsing  carl  finish it 
in the name of god  open this door 
a mirror 
dracula has no reflection
in the mirror 
but why 
maybe  to dracula
it s not a mirror at all 
it s cold  and it s snowing 
van helsing  see you on the other side 
be careful 
castle dracula 
carl  do we have a plan 
carl  doesn t have to be
wellington s at waterloo   
but some sort of plan would be nice 
van helsing  we re going to stop dracula 
anna  and kill anything
in our way 
carl  well  you let me know how that goes 
well  as grateful as i am
to be out of the cold   
that doesn t seem like a good thing 
we d better get moving 
carl  so are all of those   
anna  yes 
  and inside them are   
  yes 
igor do this  lgor do that 
how did you find   
it s impossible 
  please don t kill me 
  why not 
well  i   
my master has awakened 
  there is a cure 
  what 
dracula  he has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf 
go  find the cure  save yourself 
anna  come on  you heard him 
let s find it 
wait  why does dracula have a cure 
  i don t care 
  i do 
why does he need one  why 
because the only thing
that can kill him is a werewolf 
the painting  that s what it meant 
anna  dracula s been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries 
yes  but if one ever had the will
to turn on him  he d need a cure   
to remove the curse and
make him human before it bit him 
you re going to take these two   
  and lead them to the antidote 
  no  i m not 
yes  i am 
here s the plan  when the bell
begins to toll midnight   
you ll be able to kill dracula 
we just need to find the cure   
and get it into you
before the final stroke 
are you insane 
what kind of plan is that 
if they even suspect you
of misleading them   
clip off one of his fingers 
  i ll clip off something 
  the tower over there   
  that s where it is 
  and what about the other tower 
  give me that 
  that is where   
we reassembled the laboratory 
would i lie to you 
not if you wanted to live 
now  if i m not cured by
the twelfth stroke of midnight   
  i don t think i could 
  you must 
come on 
i don t like this plan 
we don t have a choice 
just don t get killed 
you still don t understand 
it doesn t matter
what happens to me 
we must save my family 
if you re late  run like hell 
don t be late 
now go  go 
frankenstein  get off me 
you vermin from hell 
what are you complaining about 
this is why you were made 
to prove that god is not
the only one who can create life 
and now you must give that life
to my children 
up 
there it is 
i ll go first 
carl 
stay as long as you like 
you try to get lgor  igor get you 
  go ahead  grab it 
  you go ahead and grab it 
if there s one thing i ve learned   
it s never to be the first to stick
your hand in a viscous material 
  did i scare you 
  no 
then maybe i need
to try a little harder 
viscous material 
what did i tell you 
get it 
hot 
  come on 
  yes 
we ve got to get the antidote
to van helsing  go 
you can t go until i say you can go 
keep running  carl 
and i ll say you can go
when you re dead 
carl  oh  my god 
what are you doing 
you must find the cure 
  my friends are doing it for me 
  friends 
yes  you want one 
i can t unscrew the bolts 
this is gonna hurt 
i am accustomed to pain 
it lets you know you re alive 
give me life 
one more bolt
and my young will live 
van helsing  you re almost out  my friend 
help me 
but you re supposed to die 
i want to live 
all right 
be happy in the knowledge   
that i shall weep
over your dead body 
hang on 
i ll swing you loose 
you are too late  my friend 
my children live 
then the only way to kill them
is to kill you 
correct 
so be it 
one 
no  this cannot be 
we are both part of
the same grand game  gabriel 
but we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board 
 aleera shrieks in pain 
go  go and help van helsing 
now 
thank you 
oh  my god 
anna  i need a little help 
hurry 
anna  throw it to me  carl 
yes 
you are being used  gabriel 
as was i 
but i escaped  so can you 
aleera  anna  my love   
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful 
what do you think of that 
i think if you re going to
kill someone  kill them 
don t stand there talking about it 
don t you understand 
we could be friends  partners 
brothers in arms 
did i mention that it was you
who murdered me 
it must be such a burden 
such a curse   
to be the left hand of god 
all i want is life  gabriel 
the continuation of my kind 
and perhaps the return of my ring 
don t be afraid  gabriel 
don t be afraid 
i shall give you back your life 
your memory 
some things
are better left forgotten 
for god 
god forgive me 
she s dead 
carl   eternal rest grant unto her
