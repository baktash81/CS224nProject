there s never enough 
for the tucks  it didn t exist 
time is like a wheel   
turning and turning 
never stopping
and the woods are the center 
the hub of the wheel 
it began the first week
of summer
a strange and breathless time 
when accident  or fate
bring lives together
when people are led
to do things
they ve never done before 
on this summer s day 
not so very long ago
the wheel set lives in motion
in mysterious ways 
it set mae tuck out
in her wagon
for the village of treegap
to meet her two sons as she did
once every ten years 
ma 
miles 
jesse 
oh    
oh  i missed you 
what are you doing here 
oh  i couldn t wait to see you 
i missed you  jesse

winifred 
winifred 
yes  mother 
i need a new name 
one that s not all worn out
from being called so much 
come inside this instant 
you re getting filthy 
ow  i can scarcely breathe 
 you must suffer
to be beautiful  
so say the french 
the french are crazy 
for winnie foster
the heat of summer was not
nearly as stifling
as the formality of her life 
with every passing day
the feeling grew stronger 
she was coming closer
to the end of something
and moving towards
the beginning of something new 
change was in the air 
it was only a question of when 
wait for me in the car 
i won t be a minute 
in the car  mrs  foster 
throw it home  throw it home 
come on  throw it home 
  go 
  run to me 
yay 
no  no  no  no  no 
too large for tea cakes 
none of these will do 
i prefer petit fours 
what kind of a funny hat
is that 
well  look ee here 
if it s not miss moneybags
in her fancy car 
what s the matter 
don t want
to get your feet dirty 
well  i m sorry  mrs  foster 
not much call
for such treats out here 
well  i could just make them up
for you  special 
winnie foster 
you ve got to be kidding 
wow 
winnie  run 
run  winnie  run 
throw it  throw it 
throw it home  come on 
slide  winnie  slide 
winifred 
oh  and they had
their arms crossed
and you see  the lines
were perfectly square 
come here  come here 
i want to teach you  come on 
oh  all the way from france 
how about that 
oh  look  look look at this one 
i want to see  pop  let me see 
look it 
oh  aah  he shot me

oh  my 
oh  you ll have to see this one 
miles  look at this 
oh    let s see 
okay  come here 
i want to show you 
i want to show you 
all right 
good to have you home  son 
i m glad to see you 
and the family together 
but don t get used to it 
war s coming  i hear 
i m joining up 
i m going to fight the huns 
get as far away
from this place as i can 
oh  you think
that ll solve things  do you 
you haven t had enough killing
for two lifetimes 
somebody s on to us 
i know it 
there s a man who s been
following us
and we ve lost him
several times  but   
he keeps coming back 
i think he knows something 
this man   
jesse   
whoo 
we re being tracked 
oh  miles  we lost him 
don t go spoiling everything 
yeah  we lost him  jess   
but he keeps coming back 
it was only a matter of time
before someone found us 
the world is closing in 
entire forest is almost gone 
all except this little wood 
i saw tire marks down
on the lower wash   
a few weeks ago 
there ll be more 
i don t want anyone going
to town 
not for anything 
and that s that 
tuck 
you see any strangers
in the woods getting too close
you know what to do 
no exceptions 
our time here is almost done 
i can feel it 
you ll never catch one that way 
do you know
about catching fireflies 
afraid not  never tried 
i prefer    bigger game 
though i suspect the strategy
is much the same 
strategy 
one must never announce
one s presence to the prey 
one must become part
of the scenery   
invisible   
almost disappear 
and be patient
until the exact  right moment
arrives   
take a prisoner 
for you 
no  thank you 
you re quite right 
a girl of your age
should find   
trapping suitors
more interesting
than trapping insects  anyway 
far easier  i might add 
have you lived here long 
forever  why 
i m    looking
for some old friends
who live hereabouts 
thought you might
help me find them 
my father
practically built treegap 
he knows everyone 
perhaps he can help you 
perhaps 
i quite like talking to you 
winifred 
winifred  who are you talking to
out there 
i don t know 
he hasn t told me his name 
good evening  madam 
please forgive my intrusion 
this young lady tells me
you ve lived here forever 
i thought you might know
of a certain family
goes by the name of   
i hardly know everyone 
nor do i want to 
and i don t stand outside
discussing such a thing
with    strangers 
then i beg your pardon 
good evening  young lady 
madam 
this is why i worry
about you  winifred 
you don t have the sense
not to talk to a man like that 
a proper education gains one
entr√© into society 
your mother and i have given
this a great deal of thought 
middlehouse academy for girls
in pensford 
has an excellent reputation 
middlehouse 
but that s a terrible place 
everyone says so 
it s like a jail 
nonsense 
girls emerge from there
as refined young ladies
well versed in etiquette
and manners 
both of which
you are sorely lacking 
but i don t want to be
one of those girls 
which is precisely why
you must go 
i cannot let
your unbridled nature
ruin your chances
for a respectable future 
winifred    i m sorry   
but we have to do
what s best for you 
i won t do it 
i m not like those girls 
i won t go 
winifred 
i won t go 
winnie foster was to be sent
500 miles away to be educated 
but what her parents didn t
understand
was she only wanted to step
just outside her fence   
so she did 
what in these quiet woods
should be so forbidden 
winnie had always sensed
a mystery
waiting for her there 
it was a place so entirely
different from what she knew
so far away from her tight 
pruned world 
ah 
ah   
how long have you been
standing there 
not long at all 
i was only walking past 
and i   
well  you shouldn t   
be in these parts of the woods 
it s best you turn around
and go home 
well  go on  now  get

but i own these woods  and

winifred 
winnie    foster 
a foster 
well  i ll be 
is that a fact 
well    winnie foster 
like i was saying
you need to turn around
and go home 
it just so happens
that i was on my way home
before you made
your rude suggestion
and i would be happy
to continue on my way
if i only knew which way to go 
in other words  you re lost 
i ll point you home 
i d be much obliged 
but i want a drink first 
wait    no 
no 
what 
you don t want that water 
uh  it s poisoned 
i saw you drink some 
well  now i m feeling sick

and tell him  now  are you

oh  lord

i want to go home  please

i m sure my boys

to be upset 
and i know your family
must be   
worried sick about you

 cause pa can t fish 
don t matter  there s plenty 
i catch fish 
if there s no fish 
there s no fish
if you keep scaring
the fish away 
mmm  this looks good 
oh  isn t this nice 
everybody sitting down together
and having miss foster here 
it s just like having a party 
my father will come looking
for me 
your father    will cut down
the entire forest
the way things are changing
around here 
make himself a very rich man 
oh  now  let s not ruin
a perfectly good meal
with a lot of talk 
my father has plenty of money 
he ll pay 
anything you want 
we don t want your father s
money  miss foster 
then let me go home 
we will 
we ll let you go home   
just like i promised 
directly 
we ll need to be able
to trust her first
before we re sending her
back to her folks 
trust her  we can t trust her 
or any normal people 
she ll turn on us in a second 
no  she won t 
you re a fool 
you don t even realize
what you ve done here 
him 
it s him 
robert 
i expect you to find her  henry 
that s your job 
i ve already wired her
description down the main line 
they ll keep a lookout
and we ll get up a search party
come morning 
my wife is certain that this man
wearing a yellow suit
has something to do
with winifred s disappearance 
and miss foster says so
based on    
her instincts 
hmm 
well  maybe you better step
in here  mr  foster 
am i whom you re looking for 
i do believe i fit
the description 
my wife said she saw you
talking to my daughter 
yes  i did 
she s a charming girl 
full of fire 
perhaps too much 
she s gone  is she 
looks like she    ran away 
did she now 
somehow i m not surprised 
my daughter did not    run away 
and i m not interested
in what surprises you  sir 
i want to know
if you know anything
of her whereabouts 
no  mr  foster 
i m sorry to disappoint you 
but i do not 
i am quite coincidentally here
in search of someone myself 
i m seeking a family
that used to live
in these environs 
i thought the constable could
help me locate them 
but ironically  mr  foster
your daughter thought
you could help 
name of tuck 
long lost relatives 
i i can t help you 
nor i you 
at least not now 
however  i d be happy
to search your woods
for you  mr  foster 
i m rather talented
at finding people 
i just might meet with success 
good evening  constable 
find out what happened
to her  henry 
please 
she s our only child 
angus made that cradle 
brought it all the way
from scotland 
oh  it s rocked a few tucks 
there you go 
the breeze off the lake
will keep you cool all night 
the boys sleep up in the loft
when they re home
so you ll have your privacy 
oh  that corset looks painful 
may i help you off with it 
oh  honestly  i can t understand
why women torture themselves
this way 
it s no way to live 
do you have a daughter 
a granddaughter 
and a grandson 
anna and beau 
oh  miles loved them so 
what happened 
they died 
their mother  too 
i m afraid the good parts
of miles died along with them 
you ll have to forgive
what s left of him 
i m sorry 
well  it s    it s the way
things are  miss foster 
can i call you winnie 
do you have brothers
and sisters 
no  it s only me 
my mother   
there 
so where do they go 
oh  they go different places 
do different things 
miles can do carpentry
and he s good with his hands 
jesse  now  he seems
to have settled himself 
of course  then  he s   
he s young yet 
well   
i hope you will be
comfortable here 
it s a good feeling
having another woman here 
try and get some sleep now 
hello 
have you lost your way  friend 
not hardly  reverend 
i m looking
for a family name    tuck 
are you familiar with it 
tuck  tuck 
i m afraid i can t help you 
there are no tucks
in this cemetery that i know of 
no  i wouldn t think so 
ha 
or in any other 
tell me  reverend
you who have attended
so many deathbeds   
what is it people most desire
as they face the end
of their lives 
more time 
well  i suppose 
exactly 
they d give almost anything 
i imagine  for one more year 
imagine what they d give
for all eternity 
sir  i don t quite understand
what   
you will 
reverend  are you prepared
to die right now  this instant 
if it s god s will 
what if it is my will 
what if you could be eternal 
right now  this instant 
without having to face
the uncertainty of death 
hmm 
you d like that  wouldn t you 
no muss  no fuss 
invincible to disease 
never having to suffer
the stench and rot of old age 
forever young 
you speak blasphemy  sir 
fluently 
good night  reverend 
hey  winnie foster  you asleep 
not anymore

104 
i m serious

there s my paris 
the view from the eiffel tower
can t be better than this 
i ve seen a lot of views 
and this is one of the best 
come on 
winnie foster was beginning
to lose track of time 
had she been there a day 
a week  a month 
it seemed to winnie
that the tucks lived in a way
the rest of the world
had forgotten 
they were never in a hurry
and did things the slow way 
for the first time
winnie felt free to explore 
to ask questions  to play 
me 
i m going to see the world 
every speck of it 
heck  i may even find some
new continents or something 
i mean  i ve been
to a lot of places
but the world is huge 
jesse tuck 
what what are you doing 
what does it look like 
woo hoo 
woo  ah  whoo 
come on 
i can t 
why 
you re not afraid of a little
cold water  are you 
no 
are you afraid of me 
no 
well  what then 
i can t swim 
you re joshing me 
i wish i were 
so  you re afraid you ll drown 
right 
swallow too much water 
sink to the bottom and die 
thank you for putting it
so vividly 
and  yes 
considering i d sink like a rock
drowning is a fair concern 
well  i guess i m just going
to have to enjoy this
all by myself 
hmm   
hmm 
ah  jesse 
hey  hey  it s okay 
come here  come here  come here 
i ve got you  i ve got you 
i ve got you  relax 
relax against me 
you all right 
i think so 
whoo 
you did it 
i did it 
ah  it feels wonderful 
i m weightless 
that s  cause we re
carrying you  see 
the water and me 
we re both carrying you 
you like the feeling 
i love it 
jesse  don t let go 
it s okay  it s okay 
there s no chance of that 
winnie foster 
i m never going to let you go 
you know  i don t like
being laughed at by a cheat 
now  cheat  is a nasty word 
sir 
i much prefer  card sharp  
you are looking for trouble 
aren t you  mister 
yes  sir  i sure am 
going outside 
come on 
perhaps next time   
come on 
he can t hurt me 
whoo 
thank you 
thank you very much 
excuse me  citizen 
you hear that 
tuck says
it s the most melancholy sound
in all of nature 
listen 
just listen 
they re playing for you 
whoo  yeah 
i wish this moment
could last forever 
forever 
you want to spend forever
with me  winnie 
i do 
you know  we could see
the world together 
we could do
everything together 
have a million moments
like this one that   
never  never stop 
there s a part about us
you don t know   
the part i ve sworn
not to tell you 
the secret 
the reason you don t want anyone
to find out about you 
i knew it 
you re    you re bank robbers
or grifters 
you are the first human
i ve ever met
i wanted to know the truth 
jesse tuck  you re the first
human i ve ever met
that i ve ever wanted to   
to   
   to do that 
winnie  listen 
remember the giant oak tree
at the center of the wood
where we met 
the little spring bubbling up
you saw me drink from 
you remember when i told you
i was 104 years old 
well   
it s the honest truth 
i m going to live forever 
i m never going to change 
the same with miles
and tuck and mae 
something happened to us 
as far as i know  i m   
i m going to be 17
until the end of the world 
it s the spring  winnie 
the water 
something s wrong with it 
it stops you
right where you are 
if you had a drink of it today 
you d stay just like you are 
don t you wish he d told you   
before you kissed him 
did he tell you
immortality isn t all the
preachers crack it up to be 
hey  leave her alone  miles 
oh  now    you want her
to hear it  jesse boy 
she s the first person
you want to tell the truth to 
you just don t want me
to have what you lost 
stop this   
   both of you
and tell me the truth 
i want to know 
we all had a drink   
   except for the cat   
that s important 
the water tasted like   
heaven 
floated over your tongue
like a cloud 
tuck carved a  t  in the trunk 
to mark where we d been 
we moved on west  looking
for a place to settle down 
put up a house for mae and tuck
and a little shed
for jesse and me 
that was the first time we
figured there was something   
peculiar 
jesse fell 30 feet 
landed right on his neck 
he was up on his feet again
before mae could work up
a good cry 
didn t hurt him a bit 
no broken bones    nothing 
that s not all 
not by a long shot 
things began to happen 
some brushpoppers mistook
mae s horse for a deer 
thing is 
the bullets didn t kill him 
barely even left a mark 
then tuck got bitten
by a rattlesnake 
and you know what 
he didn t die   
   but the cat did
of old age 
and miles got married 
daddy 
beau 
little anna 
tuck figured it early on 
it s the spring 
we all drank from it 
even the horse 
had to be    the source
of our changelessness 
i begged her to come back   
for me
and find the spring
and drink from it 
the children  too 
it was our only hope
to be together 
she made up her mind
i d sold my soul
to the devil   
   and she left me 
she took my babies with her 
everyone   
pulled away after that 
there was talk of witchcraft   
black magic 
i went looking for wars
to fight   
and i saw brave men die
at vera cruz   
and then gettysburg   
thousands 
in the blink of an eye   
   but not me 
i couldn t die   
   like little anna 
the influenza took her
before she s 15 
and beau 
he d be almost 80 now
if he were still alive 
and my sweet   
   my sweet young bride 
she died in an insane asylum   
   old and alone 
but i m still here 
i m still here 
winnie foster  you re the only
other person in the world
who knows about us 
we ll have to have a talk 
pa 
come on 
look around you 
it s teeming life 
it s flowers and trees
and frogs 
it s    it s all part
of the wheel 
it s always changing 
it s always growing
like you  winnie 
your life is never the same 
you were once a child 
now  you are
about to become a woman 
one day  you ll grow up
and you ll do
something important 
you ll have children 
maybe  and then one day
you ll go out   
just like the flame of a candle 
you ll make way for new life 
that s a certainty 
that s the natural way
of things 
and then  there s us 
what we tucks have 
you can t call it living 
we just    are 
we re like rocks 
stuck at the side of a stream 
listen to me 
winnie  you know
a dangerous secret 
if people find out
about the spring
they ll trample
all over each other
to get to that water 
there s one thing i ve learned
about people 
many will do anything 
anything not to die
and they ll do anything
to keep from living their life 
do you want
to stay stuck as you are
right now  forever 
i ve just got
to make you understand 
i don t want to die 
is that wrong 
no 
no human does   
but i it s part of the wheel   
the same as being born 
you can t have living
without dying 
don t be afraid of death 
winnie 
be afraid of the unlived life 
your tea  sir 
she s with them now 
i came directly here 
knowing how tormented
you must be 
we we just want her back safely 
course you do 
dreadful business  kidnapping 
fortunate i was witness 
i m perhaps the only person   
who knows where to find her 
just what is your game  sir 
what is my game 
you detect in me a playful mood 
 playful  is not
the word i had in mind 
what i have in mind
is a simple  clear cut trade 
you see 
i very much like your woods
not for their timber  mind you
but for their natural assets 
wh what is it you want 
you want your daughter 
i want your woods 
you re involved in this 
aren t you 
if you have touched
my daughter    
i have my faults  mr  foster 
kidnapping is not amongst them 
these are rough people 
the ones who took her 
no telling what they might do 
unless we do what you say 
give the man whatever he wants 
done and done 
nice to have things legal
and tidy  don t you agree 
you re an intelligent 
reasonable man  mr  foster 
i m seldom wrong
as a judge of character 
have your friendly constable
on hand
to make
the appropriate arrests 
your terrible ordeal is
as good as over 
i ll get there before you 
we have to move quickly 
they were packing to leave 
what kind of horrible people
must these kidnappers be 
there is evil in the world 
mr  foster 
there aren t fences high enough
to keep it out 
bring your men
directly to my house 
i m going with you 
it isn t fair  tuck 
no  it isn t   
but when has life
ever been fair 
how am i going to take you home
when i can t make my feet move
from this spot 
if i could die tomorrow 
i d do it   
just to spend one more night
with you 
forgive me for interrupting
such a tender moment 
hello  winifred 
everyone s been so worried
about you 
i m relieved
to find you so well 
you know this man 
i met him once 
hello  mr  tuck 
you have no idea what a pleasure
it is to meet you 
you re the man
who s been following my boys 
been expecting you 
yes  and here i am 
tell me  is it a relief   
to finally be discovered 
over a century of hiding out
must have taken its toll on you 
who are you 
and how do you know so much
about us 
i first heard about your family
from my grandmother 
she knew a woman
in a mental facility
who used to   
rant and ramble about a family
who never grew old
and never died 
this woman 
she used to call out a name 
what was it  now 
anna 
crazy old woman 
kept on talking
about a music box 
it seems the melody had a
calming effect on her children 
i m sure you know it  mrs  tuck 
you have no right   
to come to our home   
and bring us such pain 
there  good mother 
i mean no harm 
tell us  sir 
what is it you want 
well  you see  the fosters
have given me these woods
in exchange
for bringing young winifred
back home to them 
i have the papers 
all signed and legal 
gives me the rights
to the forest
and everything in it 
don t be alarmed 
i ll let you stay here   
on my land
if you prove cooperative 
cooperative 
i want you to take me
to the spring 
i don t know what you mean 
don t insult me  mr  tuck 
it s immediately clear to me
that the water s powers
have been wasted on   
unimaginative people like you 
i intend to make
this fountain of youth 
as the simpletons would call it
available to those
who deserve it   
for a price  of course 
you ll die of old age
before i ll take you 
is that so 
then  perhaps winifred will 
no 
jesse 
yes 
bravo 
come now  winifred 
i m feeling thirsty 
show me where the spring is 
perhaps i ll let you have
a drink 
after all   
   then we can spend   
eternity together 
winnie  winnie  come here 
it s okay  it s okay  i gotcha 
pa

winnie foster

i got her 
circle around to the right

winnie 
hyah 
the hall clock chimed the hour 
outside  the wind was still 
everything  it seemed 
was waiting 
we just want to understand
what happened 
winnie    try  please 
they didn t kidnap me 
i was with them
because i wanted to be 
she doesn t know
what she s saying 
the tucks were kind to me 
they re my friends 
if they didn t kidnap you 
why on earth
did that woman club that man
over the head with a shotgun 
because mae tuck
was protecting me 
doesn t matter anyway 
that fella died 
it s a murder charge now 
i didn t much like the man
but that won t stop
that poor woman from hanging 
miss is an eyewitness 
she ll have to testify 
oh  my god 
i figured you might want this 
doesn t exist 
far as i m concerned 
i sure am sorry about all this 
good day

winnie 
jesse

i was afraid
i would never see you again 
i need you to help me

i wish you were ours   
for jesse 
for all of us 
you have to hurry
and get away from here 
winnie   
winnie  come with me 
there s nothing for you here 
we can be together forever 
if she comes with us 
they ll hunt us down 
they ll never stop looking 
tuck is right 
if i go with you
it ll be too dangerous
for all of you 
i can t go without you 
you have to 
go back to the spring 
drink from it 
when it s safe   
i ll come back for you 
will you 
i have to show you
the eiffel tower  don t i 
1 652 steps to the top 
winnie   
until we re together again   
wake up with the dawn 
i will 
we got to go   
before it s too late 
winnie foster   
i will love you
till the day i die 
she s going fast
but you can have a couple
of minutes with her 
how are you 
    and to almighty god
 we commend the soul
of our sister
 and we commit her body
to the ground 
earth to earth  ashes to ashes 
dust to dust    
    resurrection
into eternal life
 through our lord jesus christ 
 at whose coming in glorious
majesty to judge the world
 the earth and the sea
shall give up their dead 
 and the corruptible bodies
of those who sleep in him
 shall be changed  and made like
unto his own glorious body 
 according to the mighty working
whereby he is able
to subdue
all things unto himself  
mother 
i was just wondering
what it is about these woods
you love so much 
mother  are you all right 
i m going to miss her  too 
oh   
every time i look at you 
you re different 
i m losing you  too 
i m right here 
forgive me  winnie 
i just wanted to keep you
my little girl forever 
go back to the spring 
when it s safe 
i ll come back for you 
what we tucks have 
you can t call it living 
we just    are 
we re like rocks stuck
at the side of a stream 
the first weeks of summer
were long over 
there was a feeling
that the wheel
was turning again   
   slowly now 
but soon to go faster 
winnie and her family
left treegap to see the world 
she wasn t certain
what herjourney might bring
but this much she knew   
it would be something
of her own choosing 
for some  time passes slowly 
an hour can seem an eternity 
for others 
there s never enough 
for jesse tuck 
it didn t exist 
tuck said it to winnie
the summer she turned 15
