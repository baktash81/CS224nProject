i know you
the gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
yet i know its true
that visions
are seldom all they seem
but if i know you
i know what youll do
youll love me at once
the way you did
once upon a dream
in a far away land
long ago lived a king
and his fair queen
many years had they longed
for a child
and finally
their wish was granted
a daughter was born
and they called her aurora
sweet aurora
yes they named her
after the dawn
for she filled their lives
with sunshine
then a great holiday
was proclaimed
throughout the kingdom
so that all of high
or low estate
might pay homage
to the infant princess
and our story begins
on that most joyful day
on that joyful day
on that joyful day
joyfully now
to our princess we come
bringing gifts
and all good wishes
to replete
our loyalty anew
hail to the princess aurora
all of her subjects
adore her
hail to the king
hail to the queen
hail to the princess aurora
health to the princess
wealth to the princess
long live
the princess aurora
hail aurora
hail aurora
health to the princess
wealth to the princess
long live
the princess aurora
hail to the king
hail to the queen
hail to the princess aurora
thus
on this great and joyous day
did all the kingdom celebrate
the awaitedawaited royal birth
and good king stefan
and his queen made welcome
their lifelong friend
their royal highnesses
king hubert
and prince philip
fondly had these
monarchs dreamed one day
their kingdoms to unite
thus today would they
announce
that philip
huberts son and heir
to stefans child
would be betrothed
and so to her
his gift he brought
and looked unknowing
on his future bride
their most honored
and exalted excellencies
the three good fairies
mistress flora
mistress fauna
and mistress merryweather
ahh
oh
the little darling
your majesties
each of us
the child may bless
with a single gift
no more no less
little princess
my gift shall be
the gift of beauty
one gift
beauty rare
gold of sunshine
in her hair
lips that shame
the red red rose
shell walk with springtime
wherever she goes
tiny princess
my gift shall be
the gift of song
one gift
the gift of song
melody her whole life long
the nightingales
her tune adore
bringing his sweet
serenade to her door
sweet princess
my gift shall be the
wind howls
why its maleficent
what does she want here
shhh
well
quite a glittering
assemblage king stefan
royalty nobility
the gentry and
ah ha ha ha ha
how quaint
even the rabble
ooooh
i really felt
quite distressed
at not receiving
an invitation
you werent wanted
not wa ah ha
oh dear
what an awkward situation
i had hoped
it was merely due
to some oversight
well in that event
id best be on my way
and
youre not offended
your excellency
why no your majesty
and to show i bear
no ill will
i too shall bestow
a gift on the child
listen well all of you
the princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty
beloved by all
who know her
but
before the sun sets
on her sixteenth birthday
she shall prick her finger
on the spindle
of a spinning wheel
and die
oh no
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
seize that creature
stand back you fools
dont despair
your majesties
merryweather still has
her gift to give
then she can undo
this fearful curse
oh no sire
maleficents powers
are far too great
but she can help
but
just do
your best dear
yes go on
sweet princess
if through this
wicked witchs trick
a spindle should
your finger prick
a ray of hope
there still may be in this
the gift i give to thee
not in death
but just in sleep
this fateful prophecy
youll keep
and from this slumber
you shall wake
when true loves kiss
the spell shall break
for true love
conquers all
but king stefan
still fearful
of his daughters life
did then and there decree
that every spinning wheel
in the kingdom
should on that very day
be burned
so rwas done
oh silly
now come have a nice
cup of tea dear
im sure it will
work out somehow
well a bonfire wont
stop maleficent
of course not
but what will
perhaps if we
reason with her
reason
with maleficent
well she cant be
all bad
oh yes she can
oooh id like to turn her
into a fat old hop toad
now dear that isnt
a very nice thing to say
besides we cant
you know our magic
doesnt work that way
it can only do good dear
to bring joy and happiness
well that would
make me happy
but there must be some way
but there must be some way
there is
there is
what is it flora
im going to
shh shh shh
shh shh shh
quietly
even walls have ears
follow me
ill turn her into a flower
maleficent
no no dear the princess
oh shed make
a lovely flower
dont you see
a flower cant prick its finger
it hasnt any
thats right
shell be perfectly safe
until maleficent
sends a frost
yes er
oh dear
she always ruins
your nicest flowers
youre right
and shell be expecting us
to do something like that
oooh
well what wont she expect
she knows everything
oh but she doesnt dear
maleficent doesnt know
anything about love
or kindness or the joy
of helping others
you know sometimes
i dont think
shes really very happy
thats it
of course
its the only thing
she cant understand
and wont expect
oh
now now now
we have to plan it carefully
lets see
the woodcutters cottage
yes yes yes
the abandoned one
of course the king and queen
will object
but when we explain
its the only way
explain what
about the three peasant women
raising a foundling child
deep in the forest
oh
well thats very nice of them
who are they
turn around
why its us
uhhuh
you mean we us
uhhuh
take care of the baby
why not
oh id like that
well yyes but wed have
to feed it
and wash it and dress it
and rock it to sleep
oh id love it
you really think we can
if humans can do it
so can we
and wed have
our magic to help us
thats right
no no no
no no no
no magic
ill take those wands
right now
oh better get rid
of those wings too
you mean live like mortals
for sixteen years
uhhuh
but now now
we dont know how
weve never done anything
without magic
and thats why maleficent
will never suspect
but wholl wash and cook
oh well all pitch in
ill take care of the baby
let me have it dear
come along now
we must tell
their majesties at once
flora
flora
so the king
and his queen watched
with heavy hearts
as their most precious
possession their only child
disappeared into the night
many sad and lonely years
passed by
for king stefan
and his people
but as the time
for the princesss
sixteenth birthday
drew near
the entire kingdom
began to rejoice
for everyone knew
that as long
as maleficents domain
the forbidden mountains
thundered with her wrath
and frustration
her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled
its incredible
sixteen years
and not a trace of her
she couldnt have vanished
into thin air
are you sure
you searched everywhere
yeah yeah uh
everywhere we all did
yeah yeah
and what about the town
the forest the mountains
uh we check mountains
uh uh forest
uh houses and uh
let me see uh
and all the cradles
cradles

theyve been looking
for a baby
oh ha ha ha

oh theyre hopeless
a disgrace
to the forces of evil
oh my pet
you are my last hope
circle far and wide
search for a maid of sixteen
with hair of sunshine gold
and lips red as the rose
go and do not fail me
and so
for sixteen long years
the whereabouts
of the princess
remained a mystery
while deep in the forest
in a woodcutters cottage
the good fairies carried out
their welllaid plan
living like mortals
they had reared the child
as their own
and called her briar rose
on this
her sixteenth birthday
the good fairies
had planned a party
and something extra special
for a surprise
