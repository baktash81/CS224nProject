i know you
the gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
yet i know it s true
that visions
are seldom all they seem
but if i know you
i know what you ll do
you ll love me at once
the way you did
once upon a dream
 in a far away land
long ago lived a king   
 and his fair queen 
 many years had they longed
for a child   
 and finally
their wish was granted 
 a daughter was born 
and they called her aurora  
sweet aurora
 yes  they named her
after the dawn   
 for she filled their lives
with sunshine 
 then a great holiday
was proclaimed   
 throughout the kingdom   
 so that all of high
or low estate   
 might pay homage
to the infant princess 
 and our story begins
on that most joyful day  
on that joyful day
on that joyful day
joyfully now
to our princess we come
bringing gifts
and all good wishes
to replete
our loyalty anew
hail to the princess aurora
all of her subjects
adore her
hail to the king
hail to the queen
hail to the princess aurora
health to the princess 
wealth to the princess
long live
the princess aurora
hail aurora
hail aurora
health to the princess 
wealth to the princess
long live
the princess aurora
hail to the king
hail to the queen
hail to the princess aurora
 thus 
on this great and joyous day   
 did all the kingdom celebrate
the awaited awaited royal birth   
 and good king stefan
and his queen made welcome   
 their lifelong friend  
their royal highnesses   
king hubert
and prince philip 
 fondly had these
monarchs dreamed one day   
 their kingdoms to unite   
 thus  today would they
announce   
 that philip 
hubert s son and heir   
 to stefan s child
would be betrothed  
 and so  to her
his gift he brought   
 and looked  unknowing 
on his future bride  
their most honored
and exalted excellencies   
the three good fairies   
mistress flora   
mistress fauna   
and mistress merryweather 
  ahh 
  oh 
the little darling 
your majesties 
each of us
the child may bless   
with a single gift   
no more  no less 
little princess 
my gift shall be   
the gift of beauty 
one gift
beauty rare
gold of sunshine
in her hair
lips that shame
the red  red rose
she ll walk with springtime
wherever she goes
tiny princess   
my gift shall be
the gift of song 
one gift
the gift of song
melody her whole life long
the nightingales
her tune adore
bringing his sweet
serenade to her door
sweet princess 
my gift shall be the   
wind howls 
why  it s maleficent 
what does she want here 
shhh 
well   
quite a glittering
assemblage  king stefan 
royalty  nobility 
the gentry  and   
ah ha ha ha ha   
how quaint 
even the rabble 
ooooh 
i really felt
quite distressed   
at not receiving
an invitation 
you weren t wanted 
not wa    ah ha 
oh  dear 
what an awkward situation 
i had hoped
it was merely due   
to some oversight 
well  in that event 
i d best be on my way 
and   
you re not offended 
your excellency 
why  no  your majesty   
and to show i bear
no ill will   
i  too  shall bestow
a gift on the child 
listen well  all of you 
the princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty   
beloved by all
who know her 
but   
before the sun sets
on her sixteenth birthday   
she shall prick her finger   
on the spindle
of a spinning wheel   
and die 
oh  no 
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
seize that creature 
stand back  you fools 
don t despair 
your majesties 
merryweather still has
her gift to give 
then she can undo
this fearful curse 
oh  no  sire 
maleficent s powers
are far too great 
but she can help 
but   
just do
your best  dear 
yes  go on 
sweet princess   
if through this
wicked witch s trick   
a spindle should
your finger prick   
a ray of hope
there still may be in this   
the gift i give to thee 
not in death 
but just in sleep   
this fateful prophecy
you ll keep   
and from this slumber
you shall wake   
when true love s kiss
the spell shall break 
for true love
conquers all
 but king stefan   
 still fearful
of his daughter s life   
 did then and there decree   
 that every spinning wheel
in the kingdom   
 should on that very day
be burned 
 so  rwas done  
oh  silly   
now  come have a nice
cup of tea  dear 
i m sure it will
work out somehow 
well  a bonfire won t
stop maleficent 
of course not 
but what will 
perhaps if we
reason with her   
reason 
with maleficent 
well  she can t be
all bad 
oh  yes  she can 
oooh  i d like to turn her
into a fat  old hop toad 
now  dear  that isn t
a very nice thing to say 
besides  we can t 
you know our magic
doesn t work that way 
it can only do good  dear   
to bring joy and happiness 
well  that would
make me happy 
but there must be some way 
but there must be some way 
there is 
there is 
what is it  flora 
i m going to   
shh  shh  shh 
shh  shh  shh 
 quietly
even walls have ears 
follow me 
i ll turn her into a flower 
maleficent 
no  no  dear  the princess 
oh  she d make
a lovely flower 
don t you see 
a flower can t prick its finger 
it hasn t any 
that s right 
she ll be perfectly safe 
until maleficent
sends a frost 
yes  er   
oh  dear 
she always ruins
your nicest flowers 
you re right   
and she ll be expecting us
to do something like that 
oooh 
well  what won t she expect 
she knows everything 
oh  but she doesn t  dear 
maleficent doesn t know
anything about love   
or kindness or the joy
of helping others 
you know  sometimes
i don t think   
she s really very happy 
that s it 
of course 
it s the only thing
she can t understand   
and won t expect 
oh 
now  now  now   
we have to plan it carefully 
let s see 
the woodcutter s cottage 
yes  yes  yes 
the abandoned one 
of course  the king and queen
will object   
but when we explain
it s the only way   
explain what 
about the three peasant women
raising a foundling child   
deep in the forest 
oh 
well  that s very nice of them 
who are they 
turn around 
  why  it s us 
  uh huh 
you mean we us 
uh huh 
take care of the baby 
why not 
oh  i d like that 
well  y yes  but we d have
to feed it   
and wash it and dress it
and rock it to sleep 
oh  i d love it 
you really think we can 
if humans can do it 
so can we 
and we d have
our magic to help us 
that s right 
no  no  no 
no  no  no 
no magic 
i ll take those wands
right now 
oh  better get rid
of those wings  too 
you mean live like mortals 
for sixteen years 
uh huh 
but now    now
we don t know how 
we ve never done anything
without magic 
and that s why maleficent
will never suspect 
but who ll wash and cook 
oh  we ll all pitch in 
i ll take care of the baby 
let me have it  dear 
come along  now 
we must tell
their majesties at once 
flora 
flora 
  so the king
and his queen watched   
 with heavy hearts   
 as their most precious
possession  their only child   
 disappeared into the night  
 many sad and lonely years
passed by   
 for king stefan
and his people 
 but as the time
for the princess s   
 sixteenth birthday
drew near   
 the entire kingdom
began to rejoice   
 for everyone knew   
 that as long
as maleficent s domain   
 the forbidden mountains   
 thundered with her wrath
and frustration   
 her evil prophecy
had not yet been fulfilled  
it s incredible 
sixteen years 
and not a trace of her 
she couldn t have vanished
into thin air 
are you sure
you searched everywhere 
yeah  yeah  uh   
everywhere    we all did 
yeah  yeah 
and what about the town 
the forest  the mountains 
uh  we check mountains   
uh    uh  forest   
uh  houses and  uh 
let me see  uh   
and all the cradles 
cradles 
uh  yep  yep 
ha ha ha ha 
every cradle 
cradle  
did you hear that  my pet 
all these years   
they ve been looking
for a baby 
oh  ha ha ha 
fools 
idiots 
imbeciles 
  aaah 
  aaah 
ooh  ooh 
ouch  ouch 
ahhh 
oh  they re hopeless   
a disgrace
to the forces of evil 
oh  my pet 
you are my last hope 
circle far and wide 
search for a maid of sixteen 
with hair of sunshine gold   
and lips red as the rose 
go  and do not fail me 
 and so 
for sixteen long years   
 the whereabouts
of the princess   
 remained a mystery   
 while deep in the forest
in a woodcutter s cottage   
 the good fairies carried out
their well laid plan 
 living like mortals   
 they had reared the child
as their own   
 and called her briar rose  
 on this 
her sixteenth birthday   
 the good fairies
had planned a party   
 and something extra special
for a surprise  
well  now 
how about this one 
this is the one i picked 
ooh  she ll look
beautiful in that 
now  i thought
a few changes here 
uh huh

we ll make it blue 
oh  no  dear  pink 
of course  we ll need
a few pleats

it s sure to come true 
and i ve seen him
so many times

come on 
we ve got to get back
to the cottage 
whistling
once upon a dream 
come in 
well   
this is a pleasant surprise 
i set my trap
for a peasant  and lo 
i catch a prince 
away with him 
but gently  my pets   
gently 
i have plans
for our royal guest 
maleficent 
she s got prince phillip 
at the forbidden mountain 
but we can t 
we can t go there 
we can  and we must 
what a pity prince phillip   
can t be here to enjoy
the celebration 
come 
we must go to the dungeon
and cheer him up 
oh  come now  prince phillip 
why so melancholy 
a wondrous future lies
before you 
you  the destined hero   
of a charming fairy tale
come true 
behold   
king stefan s castle   
and in yonder
topmost tower   
dreaming of her true love   
the princess aurora 
but see the gracious
whim of fate 
why   tis the selfsame
peasant maid   
who won the heart
of our noble prince   
but yesterday 
she is indeed
most wondrous fair 
gold of sunshine
in her hair 
lips that shame
the red  red rose 
in ageless sleep   
she finds repose 
the years roll by   
but a hundred years
to a steadfast heart   
are but a day 
and now the gates
of a dungeon part   
and our prince
is free to go his way 
off he rides
on his noble steed   
a valiant figure   
straight and tall   
to wake his love   
with love s first kiss   
and prove that true love
conquers all 
why  you    you   
come  my pet 
let us leave our noble prince   
with these happy thoughts 
a most gratifying day 
for the first time
in sixteen years   
i shall sleep well 
shh  no time to explain 
wait  prince phillip 
the road to true love
may be barred   
by still many more dangers   
which you alone
will have to face 
so arm thyself   
with this enchanted shield
of virtue   
and this mighty sword
of truth 
for these weapons
of righteousness   
will triumph over evil 
now  come  we must hurry 
whinnies 
phillip  watch out 
silence 
you  tell those fools to   
no  no 
watch out  phillip 
hurry  hurry  phillip 
a forest of thorns
shall be his tomb 
a forest of thorns
shall be his tomb 
born through the skies
on a fog of doom 
now go with the curse
and serve me well   
round stefan s castle   
cast my spell 
whinnies 
whinnies 
no  it cannot be 
now shall you deal
with me  o prince   
and all the powers of hell 
whinnies 
up  up this way 
now  sword of truth 
fly swift and sure   
that evil die and good endure 
oh  oh  uh  forgive me  hubert 
the wine 
now  uh  you were saying 
huh  i was 
oh  oh  yes 
well  after all  stefan   
this is the 14th century 
yes  you  uh   
you said that a moment ago 
well  to come right
to the point   
my son phillip says
he s going to marry   
it s aurora  she s here 
and    and    and phillip 
what does this mean  boy 
i    i don t   
but  but  but   
i don t understand 
why  fauna 
what s the matter  dear 
oh  i just love happy endings 
yes  i do  too 
blue  
pink 
i know you 
i walked with you once   
blue 
    upon a dream
i know you
the gleam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam
and i know it s true
that visions
are seldom all they seem
but if i know you
i know what you ll do
you ll love me at once
