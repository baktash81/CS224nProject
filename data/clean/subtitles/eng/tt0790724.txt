i mean you re doing one or the other
up in rockview 
this here is
district attorney rodin 
want to know what he s wondering 
whether you re gonna walk
like a man or cry like a pussy
on your way to the death house 
see  the d a  likes the needle 
whereas me 
i like to see a man like you
live a long life
with all your teeth knocked out 
passed around till a brother
can t tell your fart from a yawn 
now  i don t know
what kind of man you are 
which of these two fates you prefer 
but rodin here is a generous fellow 
he s willing to let you take your pick 
if you save us and this city
a long and costly trial 
waive your right to counsel and confess 
right now 
sixteen hours 
has to be some kind of
record  detective 
what the hell is this 
who the hell is jack reacher 
jack reacher 
born jack  not john  no middle name 
is a ghost 
no driver s licence  current or expired 
no residence  current or former 
no credit cards  no credit history 
no p o  box  cell phone  e mail 
nothing 
can you at least tell me who he is 
well  i can tell you who he was 
blood military 
born and raised on bases abroad 
mother was a french national 
father in the corps 
his first trip to the united states
was to attend west point 
four years later  he ships out for good 
iraq  afghanistan  the balkans 
you name it 
served with distinction 
silver star  bronze star 
legion of merit 
defence superior service medal 
had to look that one up 
and a purple heart 
he spent the bulk of his service
in the military police 
by all accounts  a brilliant investigator 
apparently  a troublemaker  too 
demoted to captain 
worked his way back to major 
then two years ago  he musters out 
after a literal lifetime in the military 
he just up and quits  and then 
for only the second time in his life 
he enters the united states
and simply disappears 
dead  maybe 
not according to social security
and a bank account in virginia 
his pension is deposited monthly
and someone is making the occasional
withdrawal  all wire transfers 
i can t find out where
without a federal warrant 
well  he can t drive or fly 
at least not under his real name 
  any warrants 
  record s clean 
come on  a guy this hard to find 
gotta be wanted for something 
his record is clean 
so 
how do we find this reacher 
obviously  you don t find this guy
unless he wants to be found 
excuse me  sir  there s
a jack reacher here to see you 
can i help you 
james barr 
so  now you ve seen him 
how do you know him 
why wasn t he in protective custody 
that was an oversight 
more like some corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves 
just as likely 
but it s done and we can t undo it 
so what happens now 
well  now he s in a coma 
we ll try him when he wakes up 
if he wakes up 
okay  now it s your turn  reacher 
why did he call you as a witness 
i don t believe he did 
well  i believe
he asked for you by name 
any chance i could look
at the evidence 
no way 
not till you answer some questions 
nice meeting you 
  hey  hey  hey 
  mr reacher 
  mr reacher 
  hey  stop  stop right there 
we had a deal 
i take you to barr 
you tell me what you know 
i know you say he shot five people 
i know he s in a coma 
i know there s a bus station
three miles away
and i can walk there in 24 minutes 
so you re just going to
walk out on your friend 
  he s not my friend 
  why d he ask for you  then 
well  same reason he shot five people 
he s crazy 
hey  hold on 
don t do that 
well  this is a new low 
even for both of you 
you do not talk to my client
without me present 
you know that 
we weren t talking to your client 
he s in a coma  for christ s sakes 
  you re barr s attorney 
  helen rodin  jack reacher 
  jack reacher 
  helen rodin 
yeah  she s the
district attorney s daughter 
it s a good story  actually 
i d like to hear it 
how d you find him 
how d they find you 
you can t be talking to this man 
two strikes in one day 
  it s not what it looks like 
  he came to us 
  you went to the d  a 
  is there a law against that 
none you re currently breaking 
come on  before this gets awkward 
now  hey 
say   see you in court   for me 
goodbye  detective 
  weird meeting you 
  likewise 
let s go 
so   
so  you re jack reacher 
  so you re the d a  s daughter 
  oh  jesus  please 
  is that even legal 
  fortunately 
  how does that happen 
  i ll tell you after deposition 
you don t want to depose me 
oh  well  you re my only
defence witness 
  i m not a defence witness 
  your friend james thinks you are 
he s not my friend 
why does everyone assume that 
well  why else would he ask for you
and why would you
come here to help him 
i didn t come here to help him 
i came here to bury him 
linsky 
who the hell is jack reacher 
  so why are you so hard to find 
  i m impossible to find 
why is that 
well  you could say it started out as an
exercise and became an addiction 
are you on the run 
my bus is leaving 
you better hurry  counsellor 
how do you know james barr 
  why are you representing him 
  i m a lawyer 
so is a public defender  with just as
much chance of clearing barr 
i m not trying to clear him 
i am just trying
to keep him off death row 
  by proving he s insane 
  well  that s one option 
and sticking it to your father because   
no  not my father 
the office of the district attorney 
because the office of the district
attorney never bought you a pony 
d a  rodin s never lost a capital case 
you know why 
impeccable tailoring 
  he never picks a fight he can t win 
  worked for the red baron 
every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice 
confess or face death 
against a d a  who never loses 
my firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man
has gone down without a fight 
oh  i get it 
you re an idealist 
no  i m a pacifist 
it s a noble crusade 
but this is not the fight  trust me 
james barr s guilty 
you haven t even seen the evidence 
is this a privileged conversation 
of course  it s a client conference 
nothing you say here can be repeated 
there are four types of people
who join the military 
for some  it s a family trade 
others are patriots  eager to serve 
next  you have those
who just need a job 
then there s the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people 
james barr was one of those 
he made sniper 
trained hard 
two thousand rounds a week 
and with every shot 
he s taught to visualise
the base of a man s skull
through his reticle 
the sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine 
visualise that puff of pink mist 
finally  he s deployed to iraq 
he s put on overwatch 
all day long
he stares through a scope at civilians 
women 
children 
day in  day out  for two long years
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot 
then comes the drawdown 
for james barr  the war s over 
two thousand rounds a week 
a quarter million rounds in his career 
not one at a human target 
you ve been hungry 
you ve been horny 
you ve had an itch you can t scratch 
imagine that feeling 
days  weeks  years 
imagine that feeling times 200 000 
plus 50 000 more 
imagine it s 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you re going home
and you know if you don t
scratch that itch now 
you never will 
you need a release 
you need a target 
and the who of it
never once enters your mind 
he covered his tracks well 
just like sane people do 
he almost got away with it  too 
but i caught him  and he confessed 
so why didn t he go to prison 
what barr didn t know that day was the
four civilian contractors he d picked off
just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape rally 
it was 28 women 
ages 54 on down to 11 
those were just the ones i could find
before the case was shut down 
see  the deeper i dug  the uglier it got 
and after seven long years
of  mission accomplished  
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly 
so they chalked it up to the fog of war 
made the murders go away 
this is classified information 
and that s why the privilege 
but you were ready
to tell this to the d a 
the last time i saw barr 
i made him a promise 
and when i saw his name on the news 
i came here to keep it 
  but now i know i don t have to 
  how can you be sure 
you still haven t seen the evidence 
your father has 
and he doesn t pick a fight he can t win 
barr s not getting away
with murder again 
he might 
he suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody 
when he wakes up  if he wakes up 
he may not remember the event 
he may not remember anything at all 
and this case won t be about
james barr s guilt or innocence 
it ll be about his ability to stand trial 
after everything i just told you 
you still want to defend him 
i want to see he gets a fair trial 
you said he confessed in baghdad 
he didn t confess this time 
  this time he knows better 
  this time he asked for you 
i want to know why 
you want to know why 
i can see it s eating you 
and you can t ask barr 
and the d a  won t let you
see the evidence 
my lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence  all of it 
  so where s your lead investigator 
  about to catch a bus out of town 
thanks for the coffee  counsellor 
you understand you re not just
asking me to look at the evidence 
you re asking me to look
at a cold blooded killer 
a man i know to be guilty 
a man you want to keep off death row 
and you re asking me
to look at him objectively 
yes  that is what i m asking 
i ll do it  on one condition 
name it 
you have to look
at the victims objectively 
how do you suggest i do that 
  yes 
  mr farrior 
i m helen rodin 
we spoke on the phone 
of course 
you said you re defending
the man that ki   
that man 
i represent james barr  yes 
and you have questions
about my daughter 
i do 
what for 
i was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as   
that is to say  who they were as people 
as human beings 
that s a bit unusual 
considering your position  isn t it 
that is true 
normally someone in my position
would want the jury
to know as little as possible about the   
the people that your client killed 
in cold blood 
have you spoken
with the other families 
yeah  some 
the ones who would speak with me 
come in 
thank you 
chrissie was a nanny 
she had a little girl with her that day 
yes  i know 
are you gonna go talk with that child 
no  of course not  i   
why not 
  well  i think it would be   
  insensitive 
inappropriate 
everything that you want to know
about my daughter
is right here 
the gazette did a nice piece on her 
her obituary does the rest 
thank you  i ll definitely have a look 
you a good attorney  miss rodin 
  that s not really for me to   
  just
answer the question 
yes  i suppose i am pretty good 
good enough to keep
that man off death row 
you know 
i think maybe i should go 
you stay where you are 
that man deserves to die  miss rodin 
why would you defend him 
i can see
that i have made a terrible mistake 
and i m very  very sorry
and i promise i won t bother you again 
hello  dad 
what the hell are you doing 
what am i    what 
is it true 
you re talking to the victims  families 
you  alone 
how do you know that 
how did you find me here 
i m the district attorney 
it s my business to know 
that s not an answer 
well  you re not the only one
with crack investigators  helen 
that s right  i know about reacher 
your lead investigator is a war veteran
who s been missing
for the last two years 
how can you vouch
for his state of mind 
how can you trust anything he tells you 
you don t know the man 
tell me this 
does he know you can t pay him 
that your own firm
didn t want this case 
that nobody wants this case 
you never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma 
oh  now listen to me  listen 
listen  i m speaking as your father 
whatever our differences
have been in the past 
you gotta listen to me now 
you re making a terrible mistake 
you cannot win this case 
you re going to ruin your career 
why  for what 
to hurt me  to change me 
  helen   
  don t touch me 
thanks for letting me take a look 
hey  we love it
when friends of the accused
try to tear our work to shreds 
he s not my friend 
so you keep saying  find any holes 
well  you didn t have to
put him in the hospital 
other than that  damn fine police work 
it s open and shut 
what can i say 
the scene was a gold mine 
come on  now we both know
gold s only as good as the man digging 
yeah  well  anytime you want to come
back  take a look at this stuff   
no  thanks  don t need to 
you never took any notes 
i don t need to 
so you were some real hot shit
in the army  huh 
i did all right 
so what does an army cop do mostly 
break up bar fights 
i did what you do pretty much 
with one minor difference 
what s that 
every suspect was a trained killer 
thanks again 
why do you think he paid for parking 
pardon 
he s about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers 
and he s worried about the meter maid 
 simple loony  won t do it for you 
i like to have
at least one alternate theory 
habit 
muscle memory 
i don t think he knew he was doing it 
like i said  it s damn fine work 
hey  army 
what s the serial number on the rifle 
what s the date on the quarter 
1968 
forest for the trees  detective 
forest for the trees 
mind if i share your table 
i m sandy 
so was i  last week 
on a beach  in florida 
what s your name 
jimmie reese 
you don t look like a jimmie 
what do i look like 
i don t know  but not a jimmie 
so you re new in town 
usually 
it s kind of loud in here 
do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter  i have a car 
you re old enough to drive 
i m old enough to do a lot of things 
i m on a budget  sandy 
what 
i can t afford you 
i m not a hooker 
then i really can t afford you 
seriously  i work at the auto parts store 
what i mean is  the cheapest woman
tends to be the one you pay for 
i am not a hooker 
no  a hooker would get the joke 
  what s this 
  he called me a whore 
is that true 
well  nobody said whore 
she inferred hooker  but i meant slut 
hey  that s our sister 
is she a good kisser 
hey  outside 
pay your cheque first 
i ll pay later 
you won t be able to 
you think 
all the time  you should try it 
it s a great joke 
but i m going to beat your ass 
do you want to do that here or outside 
outside 
stay here  sandy 
i don t mind the sight of blood 
when it means
you re not pregnant  anyway 
you still think you re funny now  creep 
shut your mouth  sandy 
no one is talking to you 
it s your last chance to walk away 
are you kidding  it s five against one 
it s three against one 
how do you figure 
well  once i take out the leader 
which is you 
i ll have to contend
with one or two enthusiastic wingmen 
the last two guys  they always run 
you ve done this before 
yeah 
it s getting late 
remember 
you wanted this 
it s okay  you re okay 
get up 
okay 
now we know who s who 
let s get this done 
really 
shit 
on the ground 
that s a pretty impressive
response time  fellas 
do it 
hands behind your back 
who hired you 
let s go 
hey  helen 
am i wearing too much perfume 
breathing too sternly 
detective emerson 
  somebody dead 
  and if someone is 
then they died of shame 
 cause i was being gentle 
i m starting to understand
why you move around a lot  reacher 
so no one s dead 
one guy
likely won t ever walk right again 
  you want to charge me 
  very much 
but no one s pressing 
sadly  no 
am i free to go 
hey  emerson 
4862681 
what s that 
it s the serial number on barr s rifle 
you re working for me 
do you understand that 
so everything you do
is a reflection on my firm  on me 
i was set up 
you re talking to a lawyer 
there was this girl  she came onto me 
picked a fight 
which never happens in a bar 
she was thrown
when i told her my name 
she was expecting mike tyson 
she wasn t expecting jimmie reese 
yankees second baseman 
why did you say you were
a yankees second baseman 
i always use yankees second basemen 
i didn t say i was a yankees
second baseman  i just said   
look  the point is 
she was expecting to hear
 jack reacher  
she knew who i was 
and the cops were rolling
before the fight even started 
and those five guys are her brothers 
come on 
someone sent those boys
to put me down 
who 
if someone followed you
at the river today 
it was probably a cop 
and i highly doubt   
there are three things cops never do 
they don t vote democrat 
they don t drive cadillacs 
and they never use personal vehicles 
it s not a cop 
a p i   then  or the d a  s office 
you think your father s office
would set me up 
why would anyone set you up 
how was your day 
it went exactly the way i think
you hoped it would 
you okay 
what d you learn 
chrissie farrior was 22 
a nanny caring for the six year old
daughter of family friends 
she d finally saved enough
money for a trip to china 
in fact  she should have left
the week before 
but the girl she cared for wanted
chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday 
they d gone downtown that day
to shop for a party dress 
rita coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the river cross plaza 
she was usually late for work 
but she had a good reason 
since her son marco
was nine years old
she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went 
but her dedication had paid off 
marco was now an honour student 
as a reward for all his hard work 
rita was taking him
to his first baseball game 
and she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon 
nancy holt s last words to her husband
were a lie 
  i love you  babe  see you 
  bye 
she told him she was
taking her car to be serviced 
but in fact  she was headed downtown 
it s perfect 
she told the clerk she didn t want the
purchase showing up on her credit card 
she wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary
  just a few days away 
  thank you 
oline archer never liked
her husband s construction business 
even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county 
so it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit
were forcing them
to sell to the competition 
rob 
help  help 
her husband
had given his life for the company 
but now that it was hers 
she couldn t bring herself to let it go 
she was on her way
to secure a loan that day
so she could keep the business
she d always hated 
darren sawyer was
an investment broker
in the same building where rita worked 
his wife said
he d grown increasingly distant of late 
she can t remember their last words
to one another  but they weren t kind 
darren s body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses
he d bought that morning
and his wife takes comfort
in the fact that  in his last moments 
he was most likely thinking of her 
we re gonna be okay 
we re gonna be okay 
we re gonna be okay 
we re gonna be okay 
we re gonna be okay 
we re gonna be okay 
we re gonna be okay 
so what d you learn 
you want me to say you were right 
you want me to say
that this isn t the fight 
james barr should die 
maybe he should 
i meant  what did you
learn about the victims 
what more do you want 
they were five innocent people
senselessly murdered 
i m sorry 
could you please put a shirt on 
this is my shirt 
you lose your luggage 
i don t have any luggage 
what was i saying 
  five innocent people 
  murdered at random  yes 
you know how many people
die in this country every year 
two and a half million 
that means every day 
roughly 7 000 average americans
wake up for the last time 
last friday  five of them converged
on a single spot and died together 
is that random 
what else would you call it 
well  take darren and nancy 
odds are they were having an affair 
excuse me 
you don t buy roses
for your wife on the way to work 
you buy them on the way home 
and you don t worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card
when your anniversary is that weekend 
unless it s the gift you re hiding 
and that s why she kept walking
while everyone else ran 
you can t prove that 
how hard would it be 
cell phones  e mails 
all it takes is someone willing to dig 
what s your point exactly 
my point is that two of the victims
weren t there strictly by chance 
i need a list of barr s known associates 
there isn t one  he didn t have any 
he s a classic loner 
he didn t even talk to his neighbours 
he was a quiet man 
never bothered anyone 
yeah  exactly 
  you have his credit card statement 
  i can get it  why 
i need the list
of all the places he hung out 
bars  bowling alleys  strip clubs 
gun ranges 
anywhere someone
would remember him 
what do we hope to find 
i need some sleep 
you  too 
you don t really think i m gonna   
be back to pick me up at 7 00 
yep  absolutely 
who s with you 
what happened 
that s him  isn t it 
i ain t seeing you  man 
relax  what happened 
barr s attorney hired an investigator 
name of reacher 
some sort of top shelf army cop 
he was in baghdad
the same time as barr 
so 
so barr asked for this soldier by name 
then he shows up at the river today 
then up on the highway 
almost like he knew something 
and you said we don t like
people asking questions 
no  we sure don t 
so i took steps 
you took steps 
local people  my guys 
and it blew back on you 
i figured five guys would do it 
this franchise was yours to manage 
that s all  maintenance is our thing 
you understand 
yeah  i understand  i couldn t reach you 
well  that s how this works 
well  i had to make a decision 
  these locals  i want their names 
  it s in the file 
any of them know who you are 
just one  but i took care of it 
you   
  where s the body 
  it s distributed 
relax  no one s gonna find it 
  suppose we want it found  yeah 
  why the hell would you want it found 
 cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done 
clean 
a missing person isn t clean 
christ s sakes  man  you only had to kill
one goddamn person 
you tapped five  you call that clean 
i call it done  they re looking
at the shooter  not the target 
jesus 
we make it messy now
so it won t get messy later 
and we don t leave
questions unanswered ever 
okay  all right  okay  i can fix this 
  open your eyes 
  no  i ain t seeing you 
it makes no difference now 
i made a mistake 
i mean  you can still use me 
just tell me how to fix   
to survive 
don t say  fix it   because you can t 
we covered up the one mess 
you made another 
all right  you re right 
you re right 
you re absolutely right  i m sorry 
just tell me what i have to do 
i was in prison in siberia 
i spent my first winter
wearing a dead man s coat 
a hole in one pocket 
i chewed these fingers off
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene 
these i gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine 
that is how i survived
when so many others did not 
a man this rare can always be of use 
so show me  show me you are rare 
show me you ll do anything to survive 
i don t understand 
the fingers from your left hand 
have you    have you got a knife 
did i have a knife in siberia 
no    come on  you ve got to be kidding 
you can do it 
show me 
christ 
can t  i can t 
always the bullet 
  i can t 
  i don t understand 
what do we do about the soldier 
what we always do 
barr s credit card statement 
eyewitness testimonies 
coffee  you take it black  right 
yeah  what can i say 
i take my work home 
afraid barr s credit card
statement s a dead end 
no bars  no strip joints  nothing 
pretty much just gas and groceries 
i need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here 
limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards 
sure  if you tell me why 
barr consistently filled
his tank on saturday 
and again on sunday 
he took a long drive
almost every weekend 
  he could be going anywhere 
  yes 
and if it s bars  bowling alleys
or strip clubs  we ll never find it 
but a match level gun range 
there might be two 
and he made his own bullets 
that means he shot a lot 
i m guessing every saturday 
maybe with a friend 
why is it so important
you talk to his friends 
assuming he had any 
drop me at the auto parts store 
i    wait  which one 
i don t know 
she just said  the auto parts store  
she  who 
reacher  can you be
a little more specific 
i didn t say  an auto parts store  
which one stands out in your mind
as the auto parts store 
you want me to wait 
  no  i ll meet you back at the office later 
  how will you get there 
i ll hitch a ride 
can i help you 
sandy work here 
what s this about 
so she does  thanks 
i need to speak with her 
it s a personal matter 
  she s on the clock 
  legal personal matter 
what are you  a cop 
call her out  gary 
  i m gonna need to see some i d 
  go get sandy 
well  i need to see something 
how about the inside of an ambulance 
okay  i m calling the police 
i don t think sandy wants
the police involved   
  hello

jesus  how hard did you hit him 
what  no  not me 
no  he was murdered 
and someone tried to make it
look like he left town 
well  maybe he just left town 
you pack your shower curtain
when you travel 
is this what you base
your conclusions on 
what is that on your head 
you don t want to know 
you said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings 
james barr was a sniper 
not the best  not the worst 
but he trained non stop for two years 
what does training like that do 
what does any training do 
skills become reflex  muscle memory 
you do without thinking 
it also makes people who aren t
necessarily smart seem smart
by beating some
tactical awareness into them 
now  99  of the evidence
your father has against barr
didn t exist in baghdad 
not because barr was smart 
but because he was trained 
see  from that garage 
the shooter had the sun in his eyes 
targets were moving left and right 
it s difficult conditions for any sniper 
but baghdad  you said barr
was in a parking garage then 
because in baghdad 
the sun s behind him 
targets coming straight ahead 
single file 
ideal conditions
for even an average shooter
and the exact same conditions
he would ve had
up on that highway bridge 
up there  he would never even
have to get out of the van 
no parking meter 
no camera 
no trace evidence left behind 
and his escape is assured 
now  i m not saying
that he couldn t have killed
those people at the river 
but he wouldn t have 
not that way 
  so you re saying he s crazy 
  no 
well  what exactly are you saying 
any single piece of evidence i d buy 
but all of it 
fibres  fingerprints  stray brass 
i mean   
and who the hell pays for parking 
sane or crazy 
that just doesn t make sense 
okay  so barr  he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him 
that would not explain how barr 
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions  never missed 
he did miss 
he did 
a pristine bullet 
conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop 
the same bullet that tied
barr s gun to the killings 
and arguably the prosecution s single
most important piece of evidence 
if barr wanted to get caught 
he didn t miss 
either way  it doesn t make sense 
if he wanted to get away with it 
he likely would have
and if he wanted to get caught 
barr was incapable of such perfection 
or maybe he just got lucky 
six shots out of six 
that s what i was willing to accept 
then those guys took a run at me 
whoever sent them made a mistake 
it was just a bar fight 
maybe 
or maybe someone got nervous 
tried to run me off 
or put me in a coma 
right next to their patsy 
patsy 
it was such a great crime scene 
no one stopped to think
it might be too great 
not emerson 
not your father 
not even barr s own defence attorney 
but barr knew i would 
no matter how much
i wanted it to be true 
that s why he asked for me 
wait 
are you suggesting   
james barr is innocent 
you can see what this is  can t you 
you ve got a case in your hands
