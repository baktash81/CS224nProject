i mean youre doing one or the other
up in rockview
this here is
district attorney rodin
want to know what hes wondering
whether youre gonna walk
like a man or cry like a pussy
on your way to the death house
see the da likes the needle
whereas me
i like to see a man like you
live a long life
with all your teeth knocked out
passed around till a brother
cant tell your fart from a yawn
now i dont know
what kind of man you are
which of these two fates you prefer
but rodin here is a generous fellow
hes willing to let you take your pick
if you save us and this city
a long and costly trial
waive your right to counsel and confess
right now
sixteen hours
has to be some kind of
record detective
what the hell is this
who the hell is jack reacher
jack reacher
born jack not john no middle name
is a ghost
no drivers licence current or expired
no residence current or former
no credit cards no credit history
no po box cell phone email
nothing
can you at least tell me who he is
well i can tell you who he was
blood military
born and raised on bases abroad
mother was a french national
father in the corps
his first trip to the united states
was to attend west point
four years later he ships out for good
iraq afghanistan the balkans
you name it
served with distinction
silver star bronze star
legion of merit
defence superior service medal
had to look that one up
and a purple heart
he spent the bulk of his service
in the military police
by all accounts a brilliant investigator
apparently a troublemaker too
demoted to captain
worked his way back to major
then two years ago he musters out
after a literal lifetime in the military
he just up and quits and then
for only the second time in his life
he enters the united states
and simply disappears
dead maybe
not according to social security
and a bank account in virginia
his pension is deposited monthly
and someone is making the occasional
withdrawal all wire transfers
i cant find out where
without a federal warrant
well he cant drive or fly
at least not under his real name
any warrants
records clean
come on a guy this hard to find
gotta be wanted for something
his record is clean
so
how do we find this reacher
obviously you dont find this guy
unless he wants to be found
excuse me sir theres
a jack reacher here to see you
can i help you
james barr
so now youve seen him
how do you know him
why wasnt he in protective custody
that was an oversight
more like some corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves
just as likely
but its done and we cant undo it
so what happens now
well now hes in a coma
well try him when he wakes up
if he wakes up
okay now its your turn reacher
why did he call you as a witness
i dont believe he did
well i believe
he asked for you by name
any chance i could look
at the evidence
no way
not till you answer some questions
nice meeting you
hey hey hey
mr reacher
mr reacher
hey stop stop right there
we had a deal
i take you to barr
you tell me what you know
i know you say he shot five people
i know hes in a coma
i know theres a bus station
three miles away
and i can walk there in 24 minutes
so youre just going to
walk out on your friend
hes not my friend
whyd he ask for you then
well same reason he shot five people
hes crazy
hey hold on
dont do that
well this is a new low
even for both of you
you do not talk to my client
without me present
you know that
we werent talking to your client
hes in a coma for christs sakes
youre barrs attorney
helen rodin jack reacher
jack reacher
helen rodin
yeah shes the
district attorneys daughter
its a good story actually
id like to hear it
howd you find him
howd they find you
you cant be talking to this man
two strikes in one day
its not what it looks like
he came to us
you went to the d a
is there a law against that
none youre currently breaking
come on before this gets awkward
now hey
say see you in court for me
goodbye detective
weird meeting you
likewise
lets go
so
so youre jack reacher
so youre the das daughter
oh jesus please
is that even legal
fortunately
how does that happen
ill tell you after deposition
you dont want to depose me
oh well youre my only
defence witness
im not a defence witness
your friend james thinks you are
hes not my friend
why does everyone assume that
well why else would he ask for you
and why would you
come here to help him
i didnt come here to help him
i came here to bury him
linsky
who the hell is jack reacher
so why are you so hard to find
im impossible to find
why is that
well you could say it started out as an
exercise and became an addiction
are you on the run
my bus is leaving
you better hurry counsellor
how do you know james barr
why are you representing him
im a lawyer
so is a public defender with just as
much chance of clearing barr
im not trying to clear him
i am just trying
to keep him off death row
by proving hes insane
well thats one option
and sticking it to your father because
no not my father
the office of the district attorney
because the office of the district
attorney never bought you a pony
da rodins never lost a capital case
you know why
impeccable tailoring
he never picks a fight he cant win
worked for the red baron
every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice
confess or face death
against a da who never loses
my firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man
has gone down without a fight
oh i get it
youre an idealist
no im a pacifist
its a noble crusade
but this is not the fight trust me
james barrs guilty
you havent even seen the evidence
is this a privileged conversation
of course its a client conference
nothing you say here can be repeated
there are four types of people
who join the military
for some its a family trade
others are patriots eager to serve
next you have those
who just need a job
then theres the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people
james barr was one of those
he made sniper
trained hard
two thousand rounds a week
and with every shot
hes taught to visualise
the base of a mans skull
through his reticle
the sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine
visualise that puff of pink mist
finally hes deployed to iraq
hes put on overwatch
all day long
he stares through a scope at civilians
women
children
day in day out for two long years
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot
then comes the drawdown
for james barr the wars over
two thousand rounds a week
a quarter million rounds in his career
not one at a human target
youve been hungry
youve been horny
youve had an itch you cant scratch
imagine that feeling
days weeks years
imagine that feeling times 200000
plus 50000 more
imagine its 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow youre going home
and you know if you dont
scratch that itch now
you never will
you need a release
you need a target
and the who of it
never once enters your mind
he covered his tracks well
just like sane people do
he almost got away with it too
but i caught him and he confessed
so why didnt he go to prison
what barr didnt know that day was the
four civilian contractors hed picked off
just spent the weekend
at what they call a raperally
it was 28 women
ages 54 on down to 11
those were just the ones i could find
before the case was shut down
see the deeper i dug the uglier it got
and after seven long years
of mission accomplished
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly
so they chalked it up to the fog of war
made the murders go away
this is classified information
and thats why the privilege
but you were ready
to tell this to the da
the last time i saw barr
i made him a promise
and when i saw his name on the news
i came here to keep it
but now i know i dont have to
how can you be sure
you still havent seen the evidence
your father has
and he doesnt pick a fight he cant win
barrs not getting away
with murder again
he might
he suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody
when he wakes up if he wakes up
he may not remember the event
he may not remember anything at all
and this case wont be about
james barrs guilt or innocence
itll be about his ability to stand trial
after everything i just told you
you still want to defend him
i want to see he gets a fair trial
you said he confessed in baghdad
he didnt confess this time
this time he knows better
this time he asked for you
i want to know why
you want to know why
i can see its eating you
and you cant ask barr
and the da wont let you
see the evidence
my lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence all of it
so wheres your lead investigator
about to catch a bus out of town
thanks for the coffee counsellor
you understand youre not just
asking me to look at the evidence
youre asking me to look
at a coldblooded killer
a man i know to be guilty
a man you want to keep off death row
and youre asking me
to look at him objectively
yes that is what im asking
ill do it on one condition
name it
you have to look
at the victims objectively
how do you suggest i do that
yes
mr farrior
im helen rodin
we spoke on the phone
of course
you said youre defending
the man that ki
that man
i represent james barr yes
and you have questions
about my daughter
i do
what for
i was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as
that is to say who they were as people
as human beings
thats a bit unusual
considering your position isnt it
that is true
normally someone in my position
would want the jury
to know as little as possible about the
the people that your client killed
in cold blood
have you spoken
with the other families
yeah some
the ones who would speak with me
come in
thank you
chrissie was a nanny
she had a little girl with her that day
yes i know
are you gonna go talk with that child
no of course not i
why not
well i think it would be
insensitive
inappropriate
everything that you want to know
about my daughter
is right here
the gazette did a nice piece on her
her obituary does the rest
thank you ill definitely have a look
you a good attorney miss rodin
thats not really for me to
just
answer the question
yes i suppose i am pretty good
good enough to keep
that man off death row
you know
i think maybe i should go
you stay where you are
that man deserves to die miss rodin
why would you defend him
i can see
that i have made a terrible mistake
and im very very sorry
and i promise i wont bother you again
hello dad
what the hell are you doing
what am i what
is it true
youre talking to the victims families
you alone
how do you know that
how did you find me here
im the district attorney
its my business to know
thats not an answer
well youre not the only one
with crack investigators helen
thats right i know about reacher
your lead investigator is a war veteran
whos been missing
for the last two years
how can you vouch
for his state of mind
how can you trust anything he tells you
you dont know the man
tell me this
does he know you cant pay him
that your own firm
didnt want this case
that nobody wants this case
you never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma
oh now listen to me listen
listen im speaking as your father
whatever our differences
have been in the past
you gotta listen to me now
youre making a terrible mistake
you cannot win this case
youre going to ruin your career
why for what
to hurt me to change me
helen
dont touch me
thanks for letting me take a look
hey we love it
when friends of the accused
try to tear our work to shreds
hes not my friend
so you keep saying find any holes
well you didnt have to
put him in the hospital
other than that damn fine police work
its open and shut
what can i say
the scene was a gold mine
come on now we both know
golds only as good as the man digging
yeah well anytime you want to come
back take a look at this stuff
no thanks dont need to
you never took any notes
i dont need to
so you were some real hot shit
in the army huh
i did all right
so what does an army cop do mostly
break up bar fights
i did what you do pretty much
with one minor difference
whats that
every suspect was a trained killer
thanks again
why do you think he paid for parking
pardon
hes about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers
and hes worried about the meter maid
simple loony wont do it for you
i like to have
at least one alternate theory
habit
muscle memory
i dont think he knew he was doing it
like i said its damn fine work
hey army
whats the serial number on the rifle
whats the date on the quarter
forest for the trees detective
forest for the trees
mind if i share your table
im sandy
so was i last week
on a beach in florida
whats your name
jimmie reese
you dont look like a jimmie
what do i look like
i dont know but not a jimmie
so youre new in town
usually
its kind of loud in here
do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter i have a car
youre old enough to drive
im old enough to do a lot of things
im on a budget sandy
what
i cant afford you
im not a hooker
then i really cant afford you
seriously i work at the auto parts store
what i mean is the cheapest woman
tends to be the one you pay for
i am not a hooker
no a hooker would get the joke
whats this
he called me a whore
is that true
well nobody said whore
she inferred hooker but i meant slut
hey thats our sister
is she a good kisser
hey outside
pay your cheque first
ill pay later
you wont be able to
you think
all the time you should try it
its a great joke
but im going to beat your ass
do you want to do that here or outside
outside
stay here sandy
i dont mind the sight of blood
when it means
youre not pregnant anyway
you still think youre funny now creep
shut your mouth sandy
no one is talking to you
its your last chance to walk away
are you kidding its five against one
its three against one
how do you figure
well once i take out the leader
which is you
ill have to contend
with one or two enthusiastic wingmen
the last two guys they always run
youve done this before
yeah
its getting late
remember
you wanted this
its okay youre okay
get up
okay
now we know whos who
lets get this done
really
shit
on the ground
thats a pretty impressive
response time fellas
do it
hands behind your back
who hired you
lets go
hey helen
am i wearing too much perfume
breathing too sternly
detective emerson
somebody dead
and if someone is
then they died of shame
cause i was being gentle
im starting to understand
why you move around a lot reacher
so no ones dead
one guy
likely wont ever walk right again
you want to charge me
very much
but no ones pressing
sadly no
am i free to go
hey emerson
whats that
its the serial number on barrs rifle
youre working for me
do you understand that
so everything you do
is a reflection on my firm on me
i was set up
youre talking to a lawyer
there was this girl she came onto me
picked a fight
which never happens in a bar
she was thrown
when i told her my name
she was expecting mike tyson
she wasnt expecting jimmie reese
yankees second baseman
why did you say you were
a yankees second baseman
i always use yankees second basemen
i didnt say i was a yankees
second baseman i just said
look the point is
she was expecting to hear
jack reacher
she knew who i was
and the cops were rolling
before the fight even started
and those five guys are her brothers
come on
someone sent those boys
to put me down
who
if someone followed you
at the river today
it was probably a cop
and i highly doubt
there are three things cops never do
they dont vote democrat
they dont drive cadillacs
and they never use personal vehicles
its not a cop
a pi then or the das office
you think your fathers office
would set me up
why would anyone set you up
how was your day
it went exactly the way i think
you hoped it would
you okay
whatd you learn
chrissie farrior was 22
a nanny caring for the sixyearold
daughter of family friends
shed finally saved enough
money for a trip to china
in fact she should have left
the week before
but the girl she cared for wanted
chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday
theyd gone downtown that day
to shop for a party dress
rita coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the river cross plaza
she was usually late for work
but she had a good reason
since her son marco
was nine years old
she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went
but her dedication had paid off
marco was now an honour student
as a reward for all his hard work
rita was taking him
to his first baseball game
and she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon
nancy holts last words to her husband
were a lie
i love you babe see you
bye
she told him she was
taking her car to be serviced
but in fact she was headed downtown
its perfect
she told the clerk she didnt want the
purchase showing up on her credit card
she wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary
just a few days away
thank you
oline archer never liked
her husbands construction business
even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county
so it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit
were forcing them
to sell to the competition
rob
help help
her husband
had given his life for the company
but now that it was hers
she couldnt bring herself to let it go
she was on her way
to secure a loan that day
so she could keep the business
shed always hated
darren sawyer was
an investment broker
in the same building where rita worked
his wife said
hed grown increasingly distant of late
she cant remember their last words
to one another but they werent kind
darrens body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses
hed bought that morning
and his wife takes comfort
in the fact that in his last moments
he was most likely thinking of her
were gonna be okay
were gonna be okay
were gonna be okay
were gonna be okay
were gonna be okay
were gonna be okay
were gonna be okay
so whatd you learn
you want me to say you were right
you want me to say
that this isnt the fight
james barr should die
maybe he should
i meant what did you
learn about the victims
what more do you want
they were five innocent people
senselessly murdered
im sorry
could you please put a shirt on
this is my shirt
you lose your luggage
i dont have any luggage
what was i saying
five innocent people
murdered at random yes
you know how many people
die in this country every year
two and a half million
that means every day
roughly 7000 average americans
wake up for the last time
last friday five of them converged
on a single spot and died together
is that random
what else would you call it
well take darren and nancy
odds are they were having an affair
excuse me
you dont buy roses
for your wife on the way to work
you buy them on the way home
and you dont worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card
when your anniversary is that weekend
unless its the gift youre hiding
and thats why she kept walking
while everyone else ran
you cant prove that
how hard would it be
cell phones emails
all it takes is someone willing to dig
whats your point exactly
my point is that two of the victims
werent there strictly by chance
i need a list of barrs known associates
there isnt one he didnt have any
hes a classic loner
he didnt even talk to his neighbours
he was a quiet man
never bothered anyone
yeah exactly
you have his credit card statement
i can get it why
i need the list
of all the places he hung out
bars bowling alleys strip clubs
gun ranges
anywhere someone
would remember him
what do we hope to find
i need some sleep
you too
you dont really think im gonna
be back to pick me up at 700
yep absolutely
whos with you
what happened
thats him isnt it
i aint seeing you man
relax what happened
barrs attorney hired an investigator
name of reacher
some sort of topshelf army cop
he was in baghdad
the same time as barr
so
so barr asked for this soldier by name
then he shows up at the river today
then up on the highway
almost like he knew something
and you said we dont like
people asking questions
no we sure dont
so i took steps
you took steps
local people my guys
and it blew back on you
i figured five guys would do it
this franchise was yours to manage
thats all maintenance is our thing
you understand
yeah i understand i couldnt reach you
well thats how this works
well i had to make a decision
these locals i want their names
its in the file
any of them know who you are
just one but i took care of it
you
wheres the body
its distributed
relax no ones gonna find it
suppose we want it found yeah
why the hell would you want it found
cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done
clean
a missing person isnt clean
christs sakes man you only had to kill
one goddamn person
you tapped five you call that clean
i call it done theyre looking
at the shooter not the target
jesus
we make it messy now
so it wont get messy later
and we dont leave
questions unanswered ever
okay all right okay i can fix this
open your eyes
no i aint seeing you
it makes no difference now
i made a mistake
i mean you can still use me
just tell me how to fix
to survive
dont say fix it because you cant
we covered up the one mess
you made another
all right youre right
youre right
youre absolutely right im sorry
just tell me what i have to do
i was in prison in siberia
i spent my first winter
wearing a dead mans coat
a hole in one pocket
i chewed these fingers off
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene
these i gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine
that is how i survived
when so many others did not
a man this rare can always be of use
so show me show me you are rare
show me youll do anything to survive
i dont understand
the fingers from your left hand
have you have you got a knife
did i have a knife in siberia
no come on youve got to be kidding
you can do it
show me
christ
cant i cant
always the bullet
i cant
i dont understand
what do we do about the soldier
what we always do
barrs credit card statement
eyewitness testimonies
coffee you take it black right
yeah what can i say
i take my work home
afraid barrs credit card
statements a dead end
no bars no strip joints nothing
pretty much just gas and groceries
i need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here
limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards
sure if you tell me why
barr consistently filled
his tank on saturday
and again on sunday
he took a long drive
almost every weekend
he could be going anywhere
yes
and if its bars bowling alleys
or strip clubs well never find it
but a matchlevel gun range
there might be two
and he made his own bullets
that means he shot a lot
im guessing every saturday
maybe with a friend
why is it so important
you talk to his friends
assuming he had any
drop me at the auto parts store
i wait which one
i dont know
she just said the auto parts store
she who
reacher can you be
a little more specific
i didnt say an auto parts store
which one stands out in your mind

i think jeb olivers dead
whos jeb oliver
he was the guy from the bar
jesus how hard did you hit him
what no not me
no he was murdered
and someone tried to make it
look like he left town
well maybe he just left town
you pack your shower curtain
when you travel
is this what you base
your conclusions on
what is that on your head
you dont want to know
you said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings
james barr was a sniper
not the best not the worst
but he trained nonstop for two years
what does training like that do
what does any training do
skills become reflex muscle memory
you do without thinking
it also makes people who arent
necessarily smart seem smart
by beating some
tactical awareness into them
now 99 of the evidence
your father has against barr
didnt exist in baghdad
not because barr was smart
but because he was trained
see from that garage
the shooter had the sun in his eyes
targets were moving left and right
its difficult conditions for any sniper
but baghdad you said barr
was in a parking garage then
because in baghdad
the suns behind him
targets coming straight ahead
single file
ideal conditions
for even an average shooter
and the exact same conditions
he wouldve had
up on that highway bridge
up there he would never even
have to get out of the van
no parking meter
no camera
no trace evidence left behind
and his escape is assured
now im not saying
that he couldnt have killed
those people at the river
but he wouldnt have
not that way
so youre saying hes crazy
no
well what exactly are you saying
any single piece of evidence id buy
but all of it
fibres fingerprints stray brass
i mean
and who the hell pays for parking
sane or crazy
that just doesnt make sense
okay so barr he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him
that would not explain how barr
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions never missed
he did miss
he did
a pristine bullet
conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop
the same bullet that tied
barrs gun to the killings
and arguably the prosecutions single
most important piece of evidence
if barr wanted to get caught
he didnt miss
either way it doesnt make sense
if he wanted to get away with it
he likely would have
and if he wanted to get caught
barr was incapable of such perfection
or maybe he just got lucky
six shots out of six
thats what i was willing to accept
then those guys took a run at me
whoever sent them made a mistake
it was just a bar fight
maybe
or maybe someone got nervous
tried to run me off
or put me in a coma
right next to their patsy
patsy
it was such a great crime scene
no one stopped to think
it might be too great
not emerson
not your father
not even barrs own defence attorney
