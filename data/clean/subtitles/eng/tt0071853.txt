it is l  arthur  son of uther pendragon
from the castle of camelot 
king of the britons 
defeater of the saxons 
sovereign of all england 
  pull the other one 
  i am 
this is my trusty servant patsy 
we have ridden the length
and breadth of the land   
in search of knights who will join me
in my court at camelot 
i must speak with your lord and master 
  what  ridden on a horse 
  yes 
you re using coconuts 
  what 
  you re banging together two coconuts 
so  we have ridden since the snows
of winter covered this land 
through the kingdom of mercia  
  where d you get the coconuts 
  we found them 
in mercia 
the coconut s tropical 
  what do you mean 
  this is a temperate zone 
the swallow may
fly south with the sun   
or the house martin or the plover
may seek warmer climes in winter   
yet these are not strangers
to our land 
are you suggesting coconuts migrate 
not at all 
they could be carried 
what  a swallow carrying a coconut 
it could grip it by the husk 
it s not a question
of where he grips it 
it s a simple question of weight ratios 
a five ounce bird could not carry
a one pound coconut 
it doesn t matter 
tell your master that arthur
from the court of camelot is here 
in order to maintain
air speed velocity   
a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second 
please 
  am i right 
  i m not interested 
it could be carried
by an african swallow 
an african swallow  maybe 
but not a european swallow 
  that s my point 
  i agree with that 
will you ask your master if he wants
to join my court at camelot 
but then  of course 
african swallows are nonmigratory 
so they couldn t bring
a coconut back anyway 
wait a minute  supposing two swallows
carried it together 
no  they d have to have it on a line 
simple  they just use
a strand of creeper 
 held under the dorsal guiding feathers 
 why not 
bring out your dead 
bring out your dead 
ninepence 
  here s one 
  ninepence 
  i m not dead 
  what 
  nothing  here s our ninepence 
  i m not dead 
  here  he says he s not dead 
  yes  he is 
  i m not 
  he isn t 
  he will be soon  he s ill 
  i m getting better 
you ll be stone dead in a moment 
i can t take him like that 
it s against regulations 
  i don t want to go on the cart 
  don t be such a baby 
  i can t take him 
  i feel fine 
  do us a favor 
  i can t 
can you hang around 
he won t be long 
i ve got to get to robinson s 
they ve lost nine today 
  when is your next round 
  thursday 
  i think i ll go for a walk 
  you re not fooling anyone 
  isn t there something you can do 
  i feel happy 
  thanks very much 
  not at all  see you on thursday 
  who s that 
  i don t know  must be a king 
  why 
  he hasn t got shit all over him 
  old woman  
  man  
man  sorry 
what knight lives in that castle there 
  i m 37 
  what 
i m 37  i m not old 
  i can t just call you  man  
  you could say  dennis  
  i didn t know you were called dennis 
  you didn t bother to find out 
i said  sorry  about the old woman 
but from behind  you looked  
what i object to is that you
automatically treat me like an inferior 
  i am king 
  oh  king  very nice 
and how d you get that 
by exploiting the workers 
by hanging on to
outdated imperialist dogma   
which perpetuates the economic
and social differences in our society 
  if there s ever going to be progress  
  there s lovely filth down here 
  how do you do 
  how do you do  good lady 
i m arthur  king of the britons 
whose castle is that 
  king of who 
  the britons 
 who are the britons 
 we are all britons  and i am your king 
i didn t know we had a king  i thought
we were an autonomous collective 
you re fooling yourself 
we re living in a dictatorship 
a self perpetuating autocracy
in which the working classes  
there you go bringing class
into it again 
that s what it s all about 
please  good people  i am in haste 
who lives in that castle 
no one lives there 
  then who is your lord 
  we don t have a lord 
what 
we re an anarcho syndicalist commune 
we take turns to act as sort of
an executive officer for the week 
but all the decisions
of that officer have to be ratified   
at a special biweekly meeting   
by a simple majority
in the case of internal affairs 
  but by 2 3rd s majority  
  be quiet 
  i order you to be quiet 
  order  who does he think he is 
  i am your king 
  i didn t vote for you 
  you don t vote for kings 
  how d you become king  then 
the lady of the lake   
her arm clad in the purest
shimmering samite   
held aloft excalibur
from the bosom of the water   
signifying by divine providence   
that l  arthur 
was to carry excalibur 
that is why i am your king 
strange women lying in ponds 
distributing swords   
is no basis for government 
supreme executive power derives
from a mandate from the masses   
not from some farcical aquatic ceremony 
quiet 
you can t expect to wield
supreme executive power   
because some watery tart
threw a sword at you 
shut up 
if i went around saying
i was an emperor   
just because some moistened bint lobbed
a scimitar at me  they d put me away 
shut up 
will you shut up 
now we see the violence
inherent in the system 
shut up 
come see the violence inherent in
the system  help  i m being repressed 
  bloody peasant 
  what a giveaway  did you hear that 
that s what i m on about 
did you see him repressing me 
you fight with the strength
of many men  sir knight 
i am arthur  king of the britons 
i seek the finest and bravest knights
in the land   
to join me at camelot 
you have proved yourself worthy 
will you join me 
you make me sad  so be it 
come  patsy 
  none shall pass 
  what 
none shall pass 
i have no quarrel with you 
but i must cross this bridge 
then you shall die 
i command you  as king of the britons 
to stand aside 
i move for no man 
so be it 
  now stand aside  worthy adversary 
   tis but a scratch 
  a scratch  your arm s off 
  no  it isn t 
  what s that  then 
  i ve had worse 
  you liar 
  come on  you pansy 
victory is mine 
we thank thee  lord 
that in thy mercy  
  come on 
  what 
have at you 
you are indeed brave 
but the fight is mine 
had enough  eh 
you stupid bastard 
you ve got no arms left 
  yes  i have 
  look 
it s just a flesh wound 
  stop that 
  chicken 
i ll have your leg  right 
  right 
  i ll do you for that 
  you ll what 
  come here 
  are you going to bleed on me 
  i m invincible 
you re loony 
the black knight always triumphs 
have at you 
come on  then 
all right  we ll call it a draw 
come  patsy 
i see  running away  eh 
you yellow bastards  come back here
and take what s coming to you  
i ll bite your legs off 
a witch  a witch 
a witch  we found a witch  
we ve got a witch 
a witch  a witch 
we have found a witch 
may we burn her 
  how do you know she is a witch 
  she looks like one 
bring her forward 
i m not a witch 
i m not a witch  
but you are dressed as one 
  they dressed me like this 
  no  we didn t 
and this isn t my nose 
it s a false one 
  well 
  we did do the nose 
  the nose 
  and the hat  but she is a witch  
  did you dress her up like this 
  no  no 
yes  a bit 
she has got a wart 
what makes you think
she s a witch 
she turned me into a newt 
a newt 
i got better 
burn her anyway 
qquiet  qquiet 
there are ways of telling
whether she is a witch 
  are there  what are they  tell us 
  do they hurt 
tell me  what do you do with witches 
burn them 
and what do you burn 
apart from witches 
  more witches 
  wood 
so why do witches burn 
   cause they re made of wood 
  good 
  how do we tell if she is made of wood 
  build a bridge out of her 
but can you not also make bridges
out of stone 
oh  yeah 
does wood sink in water 
  no  it floats 
  throw her into the pond 
what also floats in water 
  bread 
  apples 
  very small rocks 
  cider  great gravy 
  cherries  mud 
  churches 
  lead 
  a duck 
exactly 
so  logically  
if she weighs the same as a duck   
she s made of wood 
and therefore 
a witch 
  a duck  a duck 
  here s a duck 
we shall use my largest scales 
burn the witch  
remove the supports 
a witch 
it s a fair cop

i can t stand  it s people groveling 
  sorry

every time i talk to someone  it s
 sorry this  and  forgive me that    
and  l m not worthy  
  what are you doing now 
  averting my eyes 
don t  it s like those miserable psalms 
they re so depressing 
  now knock it off 
  yes  lord 
arthur  king of the britons   
your knights of the round table
shall have a task   
to make them an example
in these dark times 
good idea 
of course it s a good idea 
behold  arthur 
this is the holy grail 
look well  arthur   
for it is your sacred task
to seek this grail 
that is your purpose  arthur 
the quest for the holy grail 
a blessing from the lord 
god be praised 
halt 
hello 
hello 
hello  who is it 
it is king arthur  and these are
my knights of the round table 
whose castle is this 
this is the castle of my master 
guy di loimbard 
go and tell your master   
that we have been charged by god
with a sacred quest 
if he will give us food and shelter
for the night   
he can join us in our quest
for the holy grail 
i ll ask him  but i don t think
he ll be very keen 
he s already got one  you see 
  what 
  he says they ve already got one 
are you sure he s got one 
yes  it s very nice 
i told him we already got one 
well  can we come up
and have a look 
of course not 
you are english types 
what are you 
i m french   why do you think i have
this outrageous accent  you silly king 
  what are you doing in england 
  mind your own business 
if you will not show us the grail 
we shall take your castle by force 
you don t frighten us 
english pig dogs 
go and boil your bottoms 
sons of a silly person 
i blow my nose at you 
so called arthur king 
you and all your silly english   
 kniggits  
  what a strange person 
  look here  my good man  
i don t want to talk to you no more   
you empty headed animal
food trough wiper 
i fart in your general direction 
your mother was a hamster   
and your father smelt of elderberries 
is there someone else we could talk to 
no  now go away 
or i shall taunt you a second time

this one is for your mother 
run away 
filthy fiends 
i ll tear them apart 
sir  i have a plan 
  what 
  a present 
hurry  let s go 
what happens now 
now lancelot  galahad and l   
wait until nightfall 
and then leap out of the rabbit   
taking the french by surprise 
not only by surprise 
but totally unarmed 
who leaps out 
lancelot  galahad and l   
ieap out of the rabbit and  
look  if we built
this large  wooden badger  
run away 
  feature for schools  take eight 
  action 
defeat at the castle seems to
have utterly disheartened king arthur 
the ferocity of the french taunting
took him completely by surprise 
and arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required   
if the quest for the holy grail were to
be brought to a successful conclusion 
arthur  having consulted
his closest knights   
decided that they should separate
and search for the grail individually 
now this is what they did 
frank 
 the tale of sir robin   
so each of the knighfs
went fheir separate ways 
sir robin rode north
fhrough the dark foresf of ewing   
accompanied by his favorife minsfrels 
bravely  bold sir robin
rode forfh from camelot
he was not afraid fo die
o brave sir robin
he was nof at all afraid
fo be killed in nasfy ways
brave  brave  brave sir robin
he was not in fhe leasf bit scared
fo be mashed into a pulp
or fo have his eyes gouged out
and his elbows broken
to have his kneecaps splif
and his body burned away
and his limbs all hacked and mangled
brave sir robin
his head smashed in  his hearf cut ouf
his liver removed  his bowels unplugged
his nostrils raped  his botfom burnf off
and his penis  
that s enough music for now  lads 
looks like there s dirty work afoot 
anarcho syndicalist
is a way of preserving freedom 
oh  dennis  forget about freedom 
and don t drop that mud 
halt  who art thou 
he is brave sir robin
brave sir robin who

brave sir robin ran away

in which fhere are no swallows 
alfhough i fhink  
and this enchanter of whom you speak 
he has seen the grail 
where does he live 
old man  where does he live 
he knows of a cave 
a cave which no man has entered 
and the grail is there

for beyond the cave   
iies the gorge of eternal peril   
which no man has ever crossed 
but the grail

one day  lad

all you can see stretched
over the hills and valleys of this land 
  this will be your kingdom 
  but  mother  
i m father 
but  father  i don t want any of that 
listen  i built this kingdom
up from nothing 
when i started 
all there was was swamp 
all the kings said i was daft
to build a castle in a swamp   
but i built it all the same 
just to show  em 
it sank into the swamp 
so i built a second one 
that sank into the swamp 
so i built a third one 
that burned down  fell over 
then sank into the swamp 
but the fourth one stayed up 
and that s what you re gonna get 
the strongest castle in these isles 
  i don t want any of that  i d rather  
  rather what 
i d rather just sing 
stop that  you re not going
into a song while i m here 
listen  in 20 minutes
you re getting married to a girl   
whose father owns the biggest tracts
of open land in britain 
but i don t want land 
  listen  alice  
  herbert 
we live in a bloody swamp 
we need all the land we can get 
but i don t like her 
don t like her 
what s wrong with her 
she s beautiful  she s rich 
she s got huge   
tracts of land 
i know   
but i want the girl
that i marry to have   
a certain special something 
cut that out 
look  you re marrying
princess lucky   
so you better get used to the idea 
guards 
make sure the prince doesn t leave
this room until i come and get him 
not to leave the room 
even if you come and get him 
no  no  until i come and get him 
until you come and get him 
we re not to enter the room 
no  no  you stay in the room
and make sure he doesn t leave 
  and you ll come and get him 
  right 
we don t need to do anything apart
from just stop him entering the room 
  no  no  leaving the room 
  leaving the room  yes 
all right 
  yes  what is it 
  if   oh 
it s quite simple 
you just stay here and make sure
he doesn t leave the room 
all right 
oh  i remember 
can he leave the room with us 
no  no  you just keep him in here 
and make sure  
oh  yes  we ll keep him
in here  obviously 
but if he had to leave
and we were with him  
  just keep him in here  
  until you or anyone else  
  no  not anyone else  just me 
  just you 
  get back 
  get back 
  right 
  we ll stay here until you get back 
and make sure he doesn t leave 
what 
make sure he doesn t leave 
  the prince 
  yes  make sure he doesn t leave  
oh  yes  of course

to guard him when he s a guard 
  is that clear

  where are you going 
  we re coming with you 
no  no  i want you to stay here

thine enemies to tiny bits   
in thy mercy  
and the lord did grin   
and the people did feast upon
the lambs and sloths and carp   
and anchovies and orangutans
and breakfast cereals and fruit bats   
skip a bit  brother 
 and the lord spake saying   
 first shalt thou take out
the holy pin
