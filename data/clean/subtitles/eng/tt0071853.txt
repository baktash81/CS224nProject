it is l arthur son of uther pendragon
from the castle of camelot
king of the britons
defeater of the saxons
sovereign of all england
pull the other one
i am
this is my trusty servant patsy
we have ridden the length
and breadth of the land
in search of knights who will join me
in my court at camelot
i must speak with your lord and master
what ridden on a horse
yes
youre using coconuts
what
youre banging together two coconuts
so we have ridden since the snows
of winter covered this land
through the kingdom of mercia
whered you get the coconuts
we found them
in mercia
the coconuts tropical
what do you mean
this is a temperate zone
the swallow may
fly south with the sun
or the house martin or the plover
may seek warmer climes in winter
yet these are not strangers
to our land
are you suggesting coconuts migrate
not at all
they could be carried
what a swallow carrying a coconut
it could grip it by the husk
its not a question
of where he grips it
its a simple question of weight ratios
a fiveounce bird could not carry
a onepound coconut
it doesnt matter
tell your master that arthur
from the court of camelot is here
in order to maintain
air speed velocity
a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second
please
am i right
im not interested
it could be carried
by an african swallow
an african swallow maybe
but not a european swallow
thats my point
i agree with that
will you ask your master if he wants
to join my court at camelot
but then of course
african swallows are nonmigratory
so they couldnt bring
a coconut back anyway
wait a minute supposing two swallows
carried it together
no theyd have to have it on a line
simple they just use
a strand of creeper
held under the dorsal guiding feathers
why not
bring out your dead
bring out your dead
ninepence
heres one
ninepence
im not dead
what
nothing heres our ninepence
im not dead
here he says hes not dead
yes he is
im not
he isnt
he will be soon hes ill
im getting better
youll be stone dead in a moment
i cant take him like that
its against regulations
i dont want to go on the cart
dont be such a baby
i cant take him
i feel fine
do us a favor
i cant
can you hang around
he wont be long
ive got to get to robinsons
theyve lost nine today
when is your next round
thursday
i think ill go for a walk
youre not fooling anyone
isnt there something you can do
i feel happy
thanks very much
not at all see you on thursday
whos that
i dont know must be a king
why
he hasnt got shit all over him
old woman
man
man sorry
what knight lives in that castle there
im 37
what
im 37 im not old
i cant just call you man
you could say dennis
i didnt know you were called dennis
you didnt bother to find out
i said sorry about the old woman
but from behind you looked
what i object to is that you
automatically treat me like an inferior
i am king
oh king very nice
and howd you get that
by exploiting the workers
by hanging on to
outdated imperialist dogma
which perpetuates the economic
and social differences in our society
if theres ever going to be progress
theres lovely filth down here
how do you do
how do you do good lady
im arthur king of the britons
whose castle is that
king of who
the britons
who are the britons
we are all britons and i am your king
i didnt know we had a king i thought
we were an autonomous collective
youre fooling yourself
were living in a dictatorship
a selfperpetuating autocracy
in which the working classes
there you go bringing class
into it again
thats what its all about
please good people i am in haste
who lives in that castle
no one lives there
then who is your lord
we dont have a lord
what
were an anarchosyndicalist commune
we take turns to act as sort of
an executive officer for the week
but all the decisions
of that officer have to be ratified
at a special biweekly meeting
by a simple majority
in the case of internal affairs
but by 23rds majority
be quiet
i order you to be quiet
order who does he think he is
i am your king
i didnt vote for you
you dont vote for kings
howd you become king then
the lady of the lake
her arm clad in the purest
shimmering samite
held aloft excalibur
from the bosom of the water
signifying by divine providence
that l arthur
was to carry excalibur
that is why i am your king
strange women lying in ponds
distributing swords
is no basis for government
supreme executive power derives
from a mandate from the masses
not from some farcical aquatic ceremony
quiet
you cant expect to wield
supreme executive power
because some watery tart
threw a sword at you
shut up
if i went around saying
i was an emperor
just because some moistened bint lobbed
a scimitar at me theyd put me away
shut up
will you shut up
now we see the violence
inherent in the system
shut up
come see the violence inherent in
the system help im being repressed
bloody peasant
what a giveaway did you hear that
thats what im on about
did you see him repressing me
you fight with the strength
of many men sir knight
i am arthur king of the britons
i seek the finest and bravest knights
in the land
to join me at camelot
you have proved yourself worthy
will you join me
you make me sad so be it
come patsy
none shall pass
what
none shall pass
i have no quarrel with you
but i must cross this bridge
then you shall die
i command you as king of the britons
to stand aside
i move for no man
so be it
now stand aside worthy adversary
tis but a scratch
a scratch your arms off
no it isnt
whats that then
ive had worse
you liar
come on you pansy
victory is mine
we thank thee lord
that in thy mercy
come on
what
have at you
you are indeed brave
but the fight is mine
had enough eh
you stupid bastard
youve got no arms left
yes i have
look
its just a flesh wound
stop that
chicken
ill have your leg right
right
ill do you for that
youll what
come here
are you going to bleed on me
im invincible
youre loony
the black knight always triumphs

come on then
all right well call it a draw
come patsy
i see running away eh
you yellow bastards come back here
and take whats coming to you
ill bite your legs off
a witch a witch
a witch we found a witch
weve got a witch
a witch a witch
we have found a witch
may we burn her
how do you know she is a witch
she looks like one
bring her forward
im not a witch
im not a witch
but you are dressed as one
they dressed me like this
no we didnt
and this isnt my nose
its a false one
well
we did do the nose
the nose
and the hat but she is a witch
did you dress her up like this
no no
yes a bit
she has got a wart
what makes you think
shes a witch
she turned me into a newt
a newt
i got better
burn her anyway
qquiet qquiet
there are ways of telling
whether she is a witch
are there what are they tell us
do they hurt
tell me what do you do with witches
burn them
and what do you burn
apart from witches
more witches
wood
so why do witches burn
cause theyre made of wood
good
how do we tell if she is made of wood
build a bridge out of her
but can you not also make bridges
out of stone
oh yeah
does wood sink in water
no it floats
throw her into the pond
what also floats in water
bread
apples
very small rocks
cider great gravy
cherries mud
churches
lead
a duck
exactly
so logically
if she weighs the same as a duck
shes made of wood
and therefore
a witch
a duck a duck
heres a duck
we shall use my largest scales
burn the witch
remove the supports
a witch
its a fair cop
who are you who are so wise
in the ways of science

our shows are formidable
buf many times were given rhymes
fhaf are quite unsingable

we sing from the diaphragm a lof
in war were tough and able
quife indefafigable
between our quesfs we sequin vests

arthur king of the britons
your knights of the round table

to make them an example
in these dark times
good idea
of course its a good idea
behold arthur
this is the holy grail
look well arthur
for it is your sacred task
to seek this grail
that is your purpose arthur
the quest for the holy grail
a blessing from the lord
god be praised
halt
hello
hello
hello who is it
it is king arthur and these are
my knights of the round table
whose castle is this
this is the castle of my master
guy di loimbard
go and tell your master
that we have been charged by god
with a sacred quest
if he will give us food and shelter
for the night
he can join us in our quest
for the holy grail
ill ask him but i dont think
hell be very keen
hes already got one you see
what
he says theyve already got one
are you sure hes got one
yes its very nice
i told him we already got one
well can we come up
and have a look
of course not
you are english types
what are you
im french  why do you think i have
this outrageous accent you silly king
what are you doing in england
mind your own business
if you will not show us the grail
we shall take your castle by force
you dont frighten us
english pigdogs
go and boil your bottoms
sons of a silly person
i blow my nose at you
socalled arthur king
you and all your silly english
kniggits
what a strange person
look here my good man
i dont want to talk to you no more
you emptyheaded animal

filthy fiends
ill tear them apart
sir i have a plan
what
a present
hurry lets go
what happens now
now lancelot galahad and l
wait until nightfall
and then leap out of the rabbit
taking the french by surprise
not only by surprise
but totally unarmed
who leaps out
lancelot galahad and l
ieap out of the rabbit and
look if we built
this large wooden badger
run away
feature for schools take eight
action
defeat at the castle seems to
have utterly disheartened king arthur
the ferocity of the french taunting
took him completely by surprise
and arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required
if the quest for the holy grail were to
be brought to a successful conclusion
arthur having consulted
his closest knights
decided that they should separate
and search for the grail individually
now this is what they did
frank
the tale of sir robin
so each of the knighfs
went fheir separate ways
sir robin rode north
fhrough the dark foresf of ewing
accompanied by his favorife minsfrels
bravely bold sir robin
rode forfh from camelot
he was not afraid fo die
o brave sir robin
he was nof at all afraid
fo be killed in nasfy ways
brave brave brave sir robin
he was not in fhe leasf bit scared
fo be mashed into a pulp
or fo have his eyes gouged out
and his elbows broken
to have his kneecaps splif
and his body burned away
and his limbs all hacked and mangled
brave sir robin
his head smashed in his hearf cut ouf
his liver removed his bowels unplugged
his nostrils raped his botfom burnf off
and his penis
thats enough music for now lads
looks like theres dirty work afoot
anarchosyndicalist
is a way of preserving freedom
oh dennis forget about freedom
and dont drop that mud
halt who art thou

suddenly felt the icy hand
of death upon him

um yes
oh what sad times are these
when passing ruffians

to old ladies
there is a pestilence upon this land
nothing is sacred
even those who arrange
and design shrubberies
are under considerable economic stress
at this period in history
did you say shrubberies
yes
shrubberies are my trade
i am a shrubber

o knights of ni we have brought you

the knights who say ni
we are now the knights who say

we must give you a test
what is this test o knights of
knights who till recently said ni

when you have found the shrubbery
place it beside this shrubbery
only higher to get the twolevel effect
with a path down the middle
a path
then when you have found
the shrubbery
you must cut down the mightiest tree
in the forest
with a herring
we shall do no such thing

and st attila raised
the hand grenade up on high saying
o lord bless this thy hand grenade
that with it thou mayest blow
thine enemies to tiny bits
in thy mercy
and the lord did grin
and the people did feast upon
the lambs and sloths and carp
and anchovies and orangutans
and breakfast cereals and fruit bats
skip a bit brother
and the lord spake saying
first shalt thou take out
the holy pin
then shalt thou count to three
no more no less
three shall be the number
thou shalt count
and the number of the counting
shall be three
four shalt thou not count
neither count thou two
excepting that thou
then proceed to three
five is right out
once the number three

thy holy hand grenade of antioch
