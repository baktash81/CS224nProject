and did 27 000 in kansas city 
kansas city

i ve been to a cathouse 
ah 
yeah    nothing 
nothing 
so  i    so i came to you

what were you  a messenger boy 
that s right 
i delivered groceries 
yeah 
this is america 
look where we are now 
i mean  look at this
office  look at you

we both came from nothing 
that s why i can talk to you 
i understand 
so  how is esther 
she s the greatest
girl in the world 
she s my wife 
well  i know that 
i mean  she loves me 
oh  i know  i know 
500 girls marched up to my house
from the high school 
i stood behind the
curtains and i watched them 
i couldn t go out 
i mean  if they knew   
if my family knew   
i watch myself on the screen
and i want to puke 
mm 
look at me 
all right  i m a big star 
but what s really
profound about me
is that i m a big star
with a big fan club
yeah  i i know  who
actually loves his wife 
so why would anyone want to
play these lousy tricks on me 
you see what i mean 
sure  sure 
so i came to you 
yeah 
oh  yes  i see 
just play the part
the way i said 
all right then 
thanks  monroe 
thanks 
the doctor s here 
ah 
hi  doc 
come on in 
when are you going
to take that vacation 
soon 
when 
oh  sometime in
five or six weeks 
getting any sleep 
about five hours 
do you need any more pills 
no  i m fine 
any    pain 
some 
they ll never get
writers unionized 
you know why 
hello  monroe 
gentlemen 
monroe 
gentlemen 
everything all right 
fine 
i was just saying
they ll never get
the writers unionized 
you know why 
because they hate
each other s guts 
they d sell each
other out for a nickel 
this man from new york
seems pretty set on doing it   
the one who s
coming out to see me 
what s his name 
brimmer 
brimmer 
communist  yeah 
you mean a real communist 
yeah  sure  a real one 
i mean 
some of these
guys are just jokers
that call themselves communists 
and mostly they
are fairies  too 
there are other
aspects  of course 
well   
i ll find out next week 
better find out 
the last thing we
need is a writers  strike 
we got 16 pictures
going into production 
i ll handle him 
monroe can handle him 
anyway  mostly they are fairies 
there are other
aspects  of course 
monroe  tell me  what
do you think of the idea
to make manon with
a happy ending  huh 
it s been making money
without a happy ending
for a century and a half 
what about the south
american picture 
we re going ahead with that 
with the same budget 
it s out of proportion 
with that budget 
we have no chance 
what do you think  mr  marcus 
monroe is our production genius 
i count upon him
and lean heavily upon him 
the balance sheet last year
showed a  27 million profit 
it s all due to him 
you know who first told
him you were a genius 
guess 
you 
right 
damn good of you  pat 
no  no 
i admire a man  i say so 
i want the whole world to know 
perhaps that s
because i m irish 
the irish are a very
warm hearted people 
the greeks are warm  too 
i mean  try to find me
a greek communist 
you couldn t find one 
but there s not a  2 million
gross in the country right now 
don t forget  we re in the
middle of a depression 
i know that 
i think we can count on
a million and a quarter
from the road show 
perhaps a million and a half 
and a quarter of
a million abroad 
but you have a budget
of a million  seven five o 
and you say you expect
less than that in grosses 
what about prints
and advertising 
distribution costs 
interest on the money   
and some profits 
yes  he s here 
i m not even sure
we ll gross a million 
it s for you  mr  stahr 
thank you 
yes 
hello  robin 
uh huh 
good 
yes  leave the number
with miss doolin 
i ll call later 
you know  i m
fairly new out here 
do i understand you to
say that you expect to gross
a half a million
short of your budget 
it s a quality picture 
 quality picture  
what the hell are we    
we ve played safe
for two years now 
it s time we made a picture
that isn t meant to make money 
pat brady is always
saying at academy dinners
that we have a certain
duty to the public 
okay 
it s a good thing
for the company
to slip in a picture
that ll lose money   
write it off as good will 
gentlemen 
thank you 
boy 
mr  stahr 
hey  that s a good
spiral you got there 
hello  monroe  hi  dan 
sir  yes  wylie 
hello  mr  stahr 
you going somewhere 
stage four 
listen  have you read my script 
uh  yes  i have 
well  what do you think of it 
i think it s an
interesting script 
uh huh 
how come you have
two other writers on it 
take it away  who told you that 
they re friends of mine 
they didn t know i was doing it 
i didn t know
they were doing it 
we all found out this morning 
i m sorry  what can you do 
that s the system 
we re back 
you invented that system 
you ve distorted the girl 
by distorting the girl

how 
how have i distorted
the damn girl 
i m not interested
in your fantasies 
eddie 
eddie 
hello  monroe

have some people with
you  someone will spot it 
sure  i ll take care of it 
okay 
hi  cooke

she doesn t have a secret life 
you ve made her a melancholic

i have  i sent you some 
that was just talk

mm hmm 
i don t think you
people read things 
the men   
the men are dueling   
when this conversation
takes place 
at the end  one of
them falls into a well
and has to be hauled up   
in a bucket 
would you write that
in a book of your own 
of course i wouldn t 
i inherited this
absurd situation 
let me ask you 
do you ever go to the movies 
rarely 
because people
are always dueling
and falling down wells 
and talking a load of rubbish 
listen   
has your office
got a stove in it
that lights with a match 
i think so 
suppose you re in your office 
you ve been
fighting duels all day 
you re exhausted 
this is you 
a girl comes in 
she doesn t see you 
she takes off her gloves 
she opens her purse 
she dumps it out on the table 
you watch her 
this is you 
now   
she has two dimes  a
matchbox and a nickel 
she leaves the
nickel on the table 
she puts the two dimes
back into her purse 
she takes the
gloves    they re black 
puts them into the stove 
lights a match 
suddenly  the telephone rings 
she picks it up 
she listens 
she says 
 i ve never owned a pair
of black gloves in my life  
hangs up 
kneels by the stove 
lights another match 
suddenly 
you notice   
there s another
man in the room   
watching every
move the girl makes 
what happens 
i don t know 
i was just making pictures 
what was the nickel for 
jane  what was the nickel for 
the nickel was for the movies 
what do you pay me for 
i don t understand
the damn stuff 
yes  you do   
or you wouldn t have
asked about the nickel 
well  monroe s right 
lights 
needs about 20
minutes out of it 
twice it just lays
there and goes to sleep 
well  i ve got to go to
that damn writers  ball 
i ll talk to you
tomorrow  eddie

jesus

we were just
watching the rough cut 
jesus  i didn t    i
didn t hear anything

screening  mr  brady 
good evening  mr  stahr

monroe 
monroe 
hi  rod 
hello  esther 
hello  monroe 
monroe  come here 
isn t she wonderful 
isn t she beautiful 
stop 
how are you  esther 
great  really great 
this is the greatest
country in the world   
everybody stands a
chance in this country 
there s not going
to be no revolution 
the only people who want a
revolution are the communists 
and the fairies 
what kind of a revolution
do the fairies want 
a communist one 
what else 
do you think stalin
likes homosexuals 
homosexuals  eh 
let me tell you something 
you know   homo 
is a greek word 
i come from europe  i m greek 
that s why he knows
so much about stalin 
but stalin ain t greek 
you re damn right he ain t 
he s a fairy 
he s a bastard  communist 
russian fairy   
that s what he is 
calm down 
fleishacker 
let me tell you something 
after the revolution 
you ll be the only safe one 
you know why 
because they always need lawyers
after a revolution
to straighten out the legal end 
what do you think  monroe 
i think so  too 
you know  uh   
i saw highway to tomorrow 
you re right 
you take 20 minutes out of it

oh 
what does it take to
get you to leave a party 
you re the one who

i only agreed to come
because you said we
wouldn t stay so long 
not in the elevator 
main floor 
they looked so
strange when i came in 
as if they were furious at me
for not being somebody famous 
i know another way out 
back up  back up 
let them through 
how old are you 
i ve lost track 
about 35  i think

if it s a place
you re not known 
there s a place on the coast
where they have a trained seal 
he knows me pretty well 
he bit me once 
but he won t say a word
unless you re rude to him 
what are you hiding 
nothing 
what ll you have 
two teas 
right 
shake 
see 
he remembers you 
this seal has the
memory of an elephant 
he likes him   
 cause he s such a charming guy 
he responds to fish 
this seal s got taste 
come on out 
seat 
how long have you known him 
oh  i ve known him
for years 
his father s an
old friend of mine 
but the family
history ain t too good 
his mother ran off
with another seal 
is he good to you 
well  he s good to
me on the whole 
only got one problem 
he won t ride in the backseat 
that s right   
climbs over the
back and rides in front 
now  i know he s
a good driver   
but who owns the car 
right 
right 
here 
give him this 
whoa  thanks 
well  this is it 
i don t know why
i m building it 
maybe it s for you 
well  i think it s great of you
to build a big house for me
without even knowing
what i look like 
i didn t know what kind
of a roof you wanted 
i don t need a roof 
what s that for 
the projector 
the what 
the movie projector 
i gave a luncheon
out here last week 
so i had some props
and grass brought out
to see how the place felt 
is that real grass 
sure 
is it from a film set 
no 
can i walk on it 
walk 
i ll watch you 
will you live here alone 
yes 
alone with your movie projector 
mm hmm 
where do you live now 
i live in my old house 
what s this 
oh  the  uh  swimming pool 
or it will be a swimming pool 
well  you need a constant
supply of nereids to   
plunge and gambol 
nereids  what s that 
sea nymphs 
oh  no 
i ll just come out
here to read scripts 
no distractions 
i lived with a man
for a long time

i wanted to leave 
but he couldn t let me go 
so finally i ran away 
i must go now

i ll    write you a letter 
wait  wait  wait  wait 
do you ever go to the movies 
oh 
not much 
why not 
should i 
millions of people do 
why 
because movies are
necessary to them 
they give them what they need 
what you need 
it s my life 
have you got them 
yes 
this wasn t my idea 
let s go back 
to your house on the beach 
watch your head 
comfortable 
i wonder when it s settled 
what 
i mean  there s a
moment when you needn t 
and then there s another moment
when you know that
nothing in the world
can keep it from happening 
hmm 
i know why you
liked me at first 
edna told me 
what did she tell you 
that i look like minna davis 
hmm 
you were happy with her 
i don t remember 
you don t remember 
no 
i remember what she looked like 
but i don t remember
what we were like 
she became very professional 
she was very  very successful 
she answered
all her fan letters 
everyone loved her 
i was closest to her
when she was dying 
i m warm now 
does the maid live here or
just come for your breakfast 
there d be a lots for a maid
to do  looking after mr  stahr 
are you going to
stay in california 
are you 
huh 
can t you tell me 
what s the mystery 
not now 
it s not worth telling 
come here then 
you re tired 
no  i m not 
i mean  you work too hard 
don t be a mother 
what shall i be 
i ll show you 
you ve taken off my apron 
it s here i look
like minna davis   
isn t it 
no 
it s here 
what was he like 
he was a very learned man 
he could have taught
all sorts of subjects 
he taught me 
we traveled 
he was very attractive 
and he was also   
well  he was a king 
i mean  he really
was a real one 
but he was out of a job 
that s what he used to say 
i went everywhere with him 
i belonged to him 
we were too close 
we should probably have had
children to stand between us 
he wasn t really
much like a king 
not nearly as much as you 
but then none of them were 
then he started to drink 
he tried to force me to
sleep with all his friends 
and i   
i want a quiet life 
i can t stop looking at you 
i don t want to lose you 
i want a quiet life 
have you lost something 
it might have fallen out 
what 
an envelope 
is it important 
no  it doesn t matter 
i ll call you

 and that i won t be able
to see you after today 
 i should have

 but it didn t seem
to concern you 
 and it would seem silly to
spend this beautiful afternoon
 telling you about it and
watching your interest fade 
 let it fade all at once  now 
 i am very flattered that anyone
who sees so many lovely women

you re a very good
employer  mr  stahr  but  uh

the position can be   
rationalized 
i ll tell you three things 
all writers are children 
50  are drunks  and
up till very recently 
writers in hollywood
were gag men 
most of them still are gag men 
but we call them writers 
uh huh 
but  uh    they re still the
farmers in this business 
they grow the grain  but
they re not in at the feast 
it looks to me like a try
for power  mr  brimmer 
and i will not give them power 
i ll give them money 
i won t give them power 
anyway  they re not
equipped for authority 
more coffee  mr  brimmer

that they no longer
consider you competent
to negotiate with the writers 
they ve asked me
to be the spokesman
of this board in all
further discussions 
they don t consider that  uh 
trying to beat up the
writers  representative
is in the company s
best interest 
i just want to say that this
board endorses these views

fall without me
