this is one of those things
they use to send food upstairs
what are they called
dumbwaiter
hey those are moms keys

hid it here and replastered the wall
i dont know how you did it
i just know you did it
because you always do it
and now youre gonna clean it up
you told mom we were gonna clean it
we means you
simon dont you want to know
where this thing goes
not really
simon
simon wake up
i went up its a room
a secret room upstairs
theres a desk and a chest
and i found this book
something was in there
a red squirrel
no not a squirrel
unless squirrels can spell
it wrote in the dust on the desk
jared grace leave this place
wow
thats really impossible
its late
just go to sleep
do not dare to read this book
for if you take one fateful look
you barter at your lifes expense
and face a deadly consequence
what the
how did you guys get out
dear reader
what you now hold in your hands
is the culmination of a lifes work
and you will soon see as i have
that there are fantastical creatures
living among us
hidden through mimicry and magic
this book will give you
the tools and techniques
needed to lift the veil
and see the unseen
the secrets you are about to learn
have been kept hidden for ages
secrets that many of this realm
would prefer to stay hidden
the creatures you will meet
are truly a sight to behold
and most of them do not
like being observed
but over time
i have garnered their trust
some i am quite happy to report
i now call friend
but a rare few are quite frankly
to be feared
the darker forces of this realm
all live in service of one creature
the ogre mulgarath
the secrets herein are powerful
more powerful than even i was aware
never before has knowledge
of the fantastical realm
been assembled in one tome
and so i implore you dear reader
to use this information wisely
for the ogre mulgarath
seeks this knowledge
with relentless persistence
if he were to obtain the information
in these pages
i can assure you his intentions
would be of the vilest sort
he assumes many forms
and so you must constantly
be on guard
i deeply fear that the more i learn
the more i place everyone around me
in grave danger
so reader beware
i beseech you beware
mom
whats going on
mom mom please help
what happened to you
hold still
please mom just cut it cut it
okay calm down

this book has brought nothing
but heartache and misery to my family
i would say it was his lifes work
but in truth it was his life
the last day i saw him
he was so agitated
almost delirious
i remember him
running through the house
a crazed look in his eyes
that was the day he created the circle
a book mulgarath would use
to destroy all the other faeries
and then nothing could stop him
even humans
from becoming the most powerful
creature the world had ever known
my father immediately did everything
he could to protect us
everything except
master must destroy the book
no we need to protect it
keep it inside the circle
safe from the ogre
i just need more time thimbletack
