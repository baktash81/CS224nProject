please  please  don t do this 
we ll clean it up  mom 
you go to bed  you need to sleep 
  nice move  pinhead 
  shut up 
something s in there  moving 
probably a red squirrel 
very common in this region 
or it could just be a rat 
we don t need any more holes
in the wall 
great  i ll get blamed for that 
check it out 
this is one of those things
they use to send food upstairs

i just know you did it 
because you always do it 
  and now you re gonna clean it up 
  you told mom we were gonna clean it 
we means you 
simon  don t you want to know
where this thing goes 
not really 
simon 
simon  wake up 
i went up  it s a room 
a secret room  upstairs 
there s a desk and a chest 
and i found this book 
  something was in there 
  a red squirrel 
no  not a squirrel 
unless squirrels can spell 
it wrote in the dust on the desk 
 jared grace  leave this place  
wow 
that s really    impossible 
it s late 
just go to sleep 
 do not dare to read this book 
 for if you take one fateful look 
 you barter at your life s expense
and face a deadly consequence  
what the   
how did you guys get out 
dear reader 
what you now hold in your hands
is the culmination of a life s work 
and you will soon see  as i have 
that there are fantastical creatures
living among us 
hidden through mimicry and magic 
this book will give you
the tools and techniques
needed to lift the veil
and see the unseen 
the secrets you are about to learn
have been kept hidden for ages 
secrets that many of this realm
would prefer to stay hidden 
the creatures you will meet
are truly a sight to behold 
and most of them do not
like being observed 
but  over time 
i have garnered their trust 
some  i am quite happy to report 
i now call friend 
but a rare few are  quite frankly 
to be feared 
the darker forces of this realm
all live in service of one creature 
the ogre  mulgarath 
the secrets herein are powerful 
more powerful than even i was aware 
never before has knowledge
of the fantastical realm
been assembled in one tome 
and so i implore you  dear reader 
to use this information wisely 
for the ogre  mulgarath 
seeks this knowledge
with relentless persistence 
if he were to obtain the information
in these pages 
i can assure you his intentions
would be of the vilest sort 
he assumes many forms 
and so you must constantly
be on guard 
i deeply fear that the more i learn 
the more i place everyone around me
in grave danger 
so  reader  beware 
i beseech you  beware 
mom 
  what s going on 
  mom  mom  please  help 
what happened to you 
  hold still 
  please  mom  just cut it  cut it

i told you  i ll help you catch
a woodchuck or something

simon 
that s not fair  he distracted me 
  what does  appease  mean 
   appease  
you know  placate  pacify  assuage 
  in english 
  to make nice 
is that what you came out here to do 
well  apology not accepted 
i m not apologizing  cause i didn t do it

and arthur spiderwick knew about it 
and that s why he wrote this guide 
i m a little lost 
who needs to be appeased 
  the brownie

so there s a brownie and a boggart 
a brownie turns into a boggart

but  in truth  it was his life 
the last day i saw him
he was so agitated 
almost delirious 
i remember him
running through the house 
a crazed look in his eyes 
that was the day he created the circle 
a book mulgarath would use
to destroy all the other faeries 
and then nothing could stop him 
even humans 
from becoming the most powerful
creature the world had ever known 
my father immediately did everything
he could to protect us 
everything except   
master must destroy the book 
no  we need to protect it 
keep it inside the circle 
safe from the ogre

i would stare down that drive 
and dream of him
walking up those steps
and holding me in his arms once again 
but he never did 
one night  i dreamt that i saw him
