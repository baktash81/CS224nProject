you re supposed to be in moscow 
i took a detour
through your defense lab 
tell me that isn t
what i think it is 
it depends if you think it s a
poor attempt to replicate my work 
even for this group 
that takes nerve 
you were instructed to go to russia 
may i remind you  dr  pym  that
you re a soldier 
i m a scientist 
then act like one 
the pym particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed
help us put it to good use 
first you trim me to your errand boy
and now you try to steal my research 
if only you d protected janet
with such ferocity  dr  pym 
ah 
easy  hank 
you mention my wife again
and i ll show you ferocity 
don t look at me 
you said it 
i formally tender my resignation 
we don t accept it  formally 
hank 
we need you 
the pym particle is a miracle  please 
don t let your past
determine the future 
as long as i am alive 
nobody will ever get that formula 
we shouldn t let him
leave the building 
you ve already lied to him 
now you want to go to war with him 
yes 
our scientists haven t come
close to replicating his work 
he just kicked your ass full size 
you really want to find out what it s
like when you can t see him coming 
i ve known hank pym for a
long time  he s no security risk 
unless we make him one 
you like that

they were overcharging the customers  right 
and it added up to millions   he blows
the whistle and he gets fired

into the security system 
and transfers millions back to the people
that they stole it from 
posts all the bank records online 
and he drove dude s bentley into a swimming pool 
what are you doing 
  hmm 
  oh   i   
why are you telling my life s
story to these guys 
what do you want 
okay 
my cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago
about this little  perfect job 
no way 
no no no wait   this guy 
this guy fits your m o 
no 
i m finished man  i m not
going back to jail 
it s some retired millionaire living
off his golden parachute 
it s a perfect scott lang mark 
i don t care  i m out 
dr  pym 
yes  i m still alive 
i d 
perhaps that will suffice 
very sorry sir  please come in 
is that hank pym 
good morning  hank 
hope 
would it kill you to call me dad 
well  dr  cross will be so please that
you could find time to join us today 
more like  thrilled 
and i m surprised to receive any
kind of invitation from you  darren 
what s the occasion 
oh  you ll see 
won t he hope 
we re ready for you inside 
ouch 
i guess some old wounds never heal  huh 
don t worry  she s in good hands 
you re in for a treat 
long time no see  dr  pym 
how s retirement 
how s your face 
after you 
now before we start i d like to
introduce a very special guest 
this company s founder and my mentor 
dr  hank pym 
when i took over this company for dr  pym 
i immediately started researching a particle
that could change the distance between atoms
while increasing density and strength 
why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the
dust and cobwebs of hank s research  i couldn t tell you 
but just imagine 
a soldier the size of an insect 
the ultimate secret weapon 
an  ant man  
heh heh 
that s what they called you 
right  hank 
silly  i know   propaganda 
tales to astonish 
trumped up b s  to scare the u s s r 
hank  will you tell our guests what you
told me every single time i asked you 
was the ant man real 
just a tall tale 
right 
because how could anything so
miraculous possibly be real 
well i was inspired by the legend of the ant man 
and with my breakthrough 
shrinking inorganic material 
i thought  could it be possible to shrink a person 
could that be done 
well 
it s not a legend anymore 
distinguished guests  i am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it 
the yellowjacket 
the yellowjacket is an all purpose
weapon of war
capable of altering the size of the wearer
for the ultimate combat advantage 
we live in an era in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves
are undermined by constant surveillance 
it s time to return to a simpler age 
only when the powers of freedom can once
again operate openly to protect their interests 
an all purpose peace keeping vessel  the yellowjacket
can manage any conflict on the geo political landscape 
completely unseen 
efficient in both preventative
measures and tactical assault 
practical applications include surveillance 
industrial sabotage 
and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace 
a single yellowjacket offers the user unlimited
influence to carry out protective actions
and one day soon  an army of yellowjackets
will create a sustainable environment
of well being around the world 
the yellowjacket 
so it s a suit 
don t be crude  frank 
it s not a suit  it s a   
it s a vessel 
what s a matter  you re not impressed 
oh  i m impressed   i m also concerned 
imagine what our enemies could do with this tech 
we should have a longer conversation about
that  frank   i really value your opinion 
thank you for coming  hope 
thank you very much everybody 
i will escort you out now   thank you 
you seem a bit shocked 
darren 
there s a reason that i buried these secrets 
so you finally admit it 
we could ve done this together  hank 
but you ruined it 
  that s why you re the past and i m the future 
  don t do this 
dr  cross 
you sell to me first  twenty
percent of your asking price 
i can have the cash here in two weeks 
deal 
we have to make our move  hank 
how close is he 
he still can t shrink a live subject 
just give me the suit  let me
finish this once and for all 
no 
i have cross s complete trust 
it s too dangerous 
we don t have a choice 
well  that s not entirely true 
i think i found a guy 
who 
daddy 
peanut 
oh  happy birthday 
i m so sorry i m late  i didn t know
what time your party started 
it was on the invitation 
he didn t get an invitation 
but he came anyway 
well  i m not going to miss my
little girl s birthday party 
  i m gonna go tell mommy you re here 
  oh  you don t   
what are you doing here  lang 
you haven t paid a dime in child support 
you know  right now if i wanted to 
i could arrest you 
good to see you too  paxton 
mommy s so happy you re here 
she choked on her drink   ha ha 
hey  look what i have for you 
can i open it now 
of course sweetheart  it s your birthday 
you re my bestest friend 
what is that thing 
he s so ugly 
i love him 
can i go show my friends 
yeah  of course sweetheart  go ahead 
you re my bestest friend 
look  the child support is coming 
all right  it s just hard finding a job
when you have a record 
i m sure you ll figure it out  but y know 
i want you out of my house 
  no  wait  it s my daughter s birthday 
  it s my house 
  so what  it s my kid 
  relax 
you can t just show up here 
you know that  c mon 
it s a birthday party 
yeah  i know  but you
can t just show up 
  she s my daughter 
  you don t know the first thing about being a father 
maggie  i tell you this as a friend 
and as the first love of my life 
your fiance is an ass hat 
he s not an ass hat 
hey  watch your language  okay 
oh  what language 
i said hat 
really  maggie 
that guy 
come on  you could marry anyone you want 
you have to get engaged to a cop 
at least he s not a crook 
i m trying  okay   i ve changed  uh   
i m straight  i had a job  and   
i want to provide   i ve had a lot of time
to think about it  and i love her 
so much   i ve missed so much time and
i want to be a part of her life 
what do i do 
get an apartment 
get a job  pay child support 
and then we will talk about
visitation  i promise 
you re her hero  scott 
just  be the person that she
already thinks you are 
 musical horn 
i m sorry you have such deep concerns
about the yellowjacket  frank 
yeah  well uh  unfortunately
we can t just do whatever we want 
would be nice though  right 
heh heh heh 
but there are laws 
what laws  of man 
the laws of nature transcend
the laws of man 
and i ve transcended
the laws of nature 
darren  i don t think you understand 
we still haven t worked out all the bugs 
goodbye frank 
you know i ve been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately
and today during my morning meditation  an
interesting thought occurred to me and
i think it might apply to you too 
how s that 
gratitude can be forgiveness 
i spent years carrying around my
anger for hank pym 
i devoted my genius to him 
i could ve worked anywhere 
i chose my mentor poorly 
you didn t even have a choice 
he never believed in you 
it s a shame what we had to do 
but he forced us to do it  didn t he 
but we shouldn t be angry 
we should be grateful 
because his failures as a mentor 
as a father 
forced us to spread our wings 
you re a success  darren 
you deserve everything coming your way 
ooh 
stop cheating 
hey what s up hotshot 
maybe he didn t hear you 
how was the party 
tell me about that tip 
wha 
i wanna know about that tip 
  oh baby  it s on 
  hot dog 
it s so on right now 
calm down  all right  i just need
to know where it came from 
it s gotta be airtight 
okay 
i was at a wine tasting with my cousin ernesto
it was mainly reds  and you know
i don t love reds man  y know  but
there was a rosé that saved the
day  it was delightful 
and  he tells me about this girl
emily that we used to kick it with 
it was actually the first pair of
boobs that i ever touched 
it s the wrong details   it s wro 
has nothing to do with the story 
go 
so  uh   he tells me that 
she s working as a housekeeper now  right 
and she s dating this dude carlos who s
a shot caller from across the bay and
she tells him about the dude that
she s cleaning for  right 
that he s  like  this big shot ceo that
is all retired now but he s loaded 
and so  carlos and ernesto are
on the same softball team
and the get to talking  right 
and here comes the good part 
carlos says 
yo  man  this guy s got a big ass safe
just sitting in the basement 
just chillin  
of course ernesto comes to me  cause
he knows i ve got mad thieving skills 
of course i ask him 
did emily tell carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was 
and he says
naw  dog  all she said is that
it s  like  super legit  and
whatever s in it has gotta be good 
what 
old man have safe 
and he s gone for a week 
all right   there s an old man  he s got
a safe  and he s gone for a week 
let s just work with that 
y know what i  sayin  
landlines cut  cell signals jammed 
no one will be making
for distress call tonight 
all check 
  check 
  check 
if the job goes bad  you know
i got your back  right 
don t worry  it s not gonna happen 
i love it when he gets cocky 
damn 
alarm is dead 
nice 
all right  i m moving through the house 
there s a fingerprint lock on the door 
he s got a what 
ernesto didn t tell me nothing about that 
aw  man  are we screwed 
not necessarily 
i m in 
no alarms have been triggered 
he s in like the flynn 
oh  man 
what is it 
well they weren t kidding 
this safe is serious 
how serious we talkin   scotty 
it s a carbondale 
it s from 1910 
made from the same steel
as the titanic 
wow 
can you crack it 
well  here s the thing 
it doesn t do so well in the cold 
remember what that iceberg did 
yeah  man  it killed dicaprio 
killed everybody 
man  not kill the old lady 
she still throw the jewel into the oceans 
what re you doing 
i poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen 
ice expands  metal doesn t 
what are you doing now 
waiting 
waiting 
nice 
what is it  cash  jewels 
there s nothing here 
what d you say 
it s a suit 
what 
it s an old motorcycle suit 
there s no cash  no jewelry  nothing 
no 
it s a bust 
i m really sorry  scotty 
i know you needed a score 
i thought we were using mice 
what s the difference 
commence experiment 34 c 
organic atomic reduction 
darren  maybe we should think 
shrinking organic tissue is the
centerpiece of this technology 
i can t go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough 
experiment 34 c results   
negative 
sanitize the workstation 
bring in subject 35 c 
why would you lock this up 
so weird 
scott  what s up man 
i wonder   what is this 
the world sure seems different
from down here  doesn t it  scott 
what  who   who said that 
luis  luis  i m here 
it s a trial by fire  scott 
or in this case 
water 
guess you re tougher than you thought 
oh  i don t want to see this 
luis 
son of a  
what the hell 
not bad for a test drive 
keep the suit 
i ll be in touch 
no  no  no 
no thank you 
put it down on the ground 
you are under arrest 
no  i didn t steal anything 
i was returning
something i stole 
you know  you almost had us convinced
that you were going to change your ways 
they were really rooting for you 
it s gonna break their hearts 
you got a visitor 
who 
your lawyer 
my lawyer 
i told you i d be in touch  scott 
i m starting to think that you
prefer the inside of a jail cell 
oh man 
sit down 
sir  i m sorry i stole the suit 
i don t even want to
know why you have it 
maggie was right about you 
how do you know about 
the way she s trying to keep
you away from cassie 
the moment things get hard 
you turn right back to crime 
the way i see it  you have a choice 
you can either spend the
rest of your life in prison
or go back to your cell
and await further instructions 
i don t understand 
i don t expect you to 
but you don t have many options right now 
quite frankly  neither do i 
why do you think i let you steal
that suit in the first place 
what 
second chances don t come
around all that much 
so next time you think you might see one
i suggest you take a real close look at it 
you are my bestest friend 
are you sure you don t
want a different toy 
no  i love this one 
okay 
well  get some sleep then 
  mommy 
  hm 
is daddy a bad man 
i heard some grown ups say he s bad 
no 
daddy just gets confused
sometimes  you know 
smart choice 
you actually listened for once 
under the door 
okay  where to now 
hang tight 
what  what  
where the hell did he go 
i have no idea  he just vanished 
set up a five block perimeter  now 
get back  get back  get back 
scott  these are my associates 
huh  you got a camera on an ant 
yeah  sure  why not 
where s the car 
no car  we ve got wings 
incoming 
put your foot on the
central node and not the thorax 
are you ki  how safe s th 
get on the damn ant  scott 
why am i on a police car 
shouldn t i not be on a police car 
so they can give you a lift
past their five block perimeter 
whoa  all right 
now  what s the next move 
hang on tight 
oh  this is easy 
i m getting the hang of this 
yank up to go up 
it s like a horse 
you re throwing 247 off balance 
  wait  his name is 247 
  he doesn t have a name 
he has a number scott  do you have
any idea how many ants there are 
whoa 
please   maybe it s 248 
no no no no no
vertigo  vertigo 
no  i think it s 247 
  wait 
  hang on 
i think i m getting the hang of this 
i m controlling 247 
he is not listening to you 
what 
can i make one little request 
no 
stop new york city  time out  time out 
time out 
all right  hold on 
just  wait  whoa  uh 
what happens if i
throw up in this helmet 
it s my helmet scott 
do not throw up 
just set  er down  all right 
i m getting light headed 
hang on  scott 
yeah  i m getting a little light   
 t s  it s funny   
   hit me  andfarness 
hello 
who are you 
have you been standing there
watching me sleep this whole time 
yes 
why 
because the last time you were
here you stole something 
oh  oh 
hey  look 
whoa 
paraponera clavata 
giant tropical bullet ants ranked
highest on the schmidt pain index 
they re here to keep an eye
on you when i can t 
dr  pym s waiting for you downstairs 
who 
ahhh   hey  um 
whose pajamas are these 
how am i supposed to do this 
hey  j  just one step at a time 
ugh 
you don t bite me 
i don t step on you  deal 
take down the servers and
cross wouldn t even know 
we don t need this guy 
i assume that you ve already
met my daughter hope 
i did 
she s great 
she doesn t think that we need you 
we don t  we can do this ourselves 
i go to all this effort to let you
steal my suit  and then hope
has you arrested 
okay  we can try this and
when he fails i ll do it myself 
she s a little bit anxious 
it has to do with this job 
which  judging by the fact that
you re sitting opposite me 
i take it that you re interested in 
what job 
would you like some tea 
uh  sure 
i was very impressed with how you
managed to get past my security system 
freezing that metal was particularly clever 
were you watching me 
scott  i ve been watching you for a while 
ever since you robbed vista corp 
oh  excuse me  burgled vista corp 
vista s security system is one of the most
advanced in the business 
it s supposed to be unbeatable
but you beat it 
would you like some sugar 
yeah  thanks 
you know what  i m okay 
how do you make them do that 
ants can lift objects
fifty times their weight 
they build  farm  they
cooperate with each other 
right  but how do you
make them do that 
i use electromagnetic waves  to
stimulate their olfactory nerve center 
i speak to them 
i can go anywhere  hear
anything  and see everything 
and still know absolutely nothing 
i m late to meet cross 
uh   dr  pym 
you don t need to raise your hand  scott 
sorry  i just have one question 
who are you who is she what the hell s
going on and can i go back to jail now 
come with me 
twenty years ago i created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance 
huh 
i learned how to change the distance
between atoms  that s what powers the suit 
that s why it works 
wow 
  whoa 
  it was dangerous 
it was too dangerous 
so i hid it from the world 
and that s when i switched gears
and i started my own company 
pym tech 
yes 
i took on a young protege
called darren cross 
darren cross 
he s a big deal 
but before he was a big deal
he was my assistant 
i thought i saw something in him 
a son i never had perhaps 
he was brilliant  but as we became
close he began to suspect
that i wasn t telling him everything 
he heard rumors about what
was called the pym particles 
and he became obsessed with
recreating my formula 
but i wouldn t help him so he
conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company 
how could he do that 
the board s chairman
is my daughter  hope 
she was the deciding vote 
but she came back to me when she saw
how close cross was to cracking my formula 
the process is highly volatile 
what isn t protected by a specialized helmet
can affect the brain s chemistry 
i don t think darren realizes this  and y know 
he s not the most stable guy to begin with 
so  what do you want from me 
scott  i believe that everyone
deserves a shot at redemption 
do you 
i do 
if you can help me  i promise i can
help you be with your daughter again 
now are you ready to redeem yourself 
absolutely 
my days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done 
what do you want me to do 
i want you to break into a
place and steal some shit 
you going to be home for dinner tonight 
uh  yeah 
i ll pick something up  okay 
okay 
good news 
uh  i don t know 
it s news 
are you trying to find my daddy 
yeah  i am  sweetheart 
i just want your
daddy to be safe 
hope you don t catch him 
this isn t the first time these guys
have tried to get their hands
on game changing weaponry 
that s mitchell carson 
ex head of defense at shield 
presently in the business
of toppling governments 
he always wanted my tech 
and now  unless we break in
and steal the yellowjacket
and destroy all the data 
darren cross is gonna unleash
chaos upon the world 
i think our first move should
be calling the avengers 
i ve spent half my life trying to keep this
technology out of the hands of a stark 
i m sure as hell not going to
hand deliver it to one now 
this is not some cute technology
like the iron man suit 
this could change the texture of reality 
besides they re probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky 
okay  then why don t you just send the ants 
scott  they are ants 
ants  they can do a lot of things 
but they still need a leader 
somebody that can infiltrate a place
that s designed to prevent infiltration 
hank  i m a thief 
all right  i m a good thief 
but this is insane 
he s right hank and you know it 
you ve seen the footage 
you know what cross is capable of 
i was against using him when we had
months  now we have days 
i m wearing the suit 
absolutely not 
i know the facility inside and out 
i know how cross thinks 
i know this mission better
than anybody here 
we need you close to cross
otherwise this mission cannot work 
  we don t have time to screw around 
  hope  please  this is an     
he is a criminal 
i m your daughter 
no 
she s right  hank 
i m not your guy 
why don t you wear the suit 
you think i don t want to 
i can t 
i spent years wearing it 
it took a toll on me 
you re our only option 
before hope lost her mother 
she used to look at me like
i was the greatest man in the world 
and now she looks at me
and it s just disappointment 
it s too late for me 
but not for you 
this is your chance 
the chance to earn that look
in your daughter s eyes 
to become the hero that she
already thinks you are 
it s not about saving our world 
it s about saving theirs 
damn  that was a good speech 
scott 
i need you
to be the ant man 
in the right hands  the relationship
between man and suit is symbiotic 
the suit has power  the man
harnesses that power 
you need to be skillful 
agile  and above all 
you need to be fast 
you should be able to shrink
and grow on a dime  so
your size always suits your needs 
now dive through the keyhole  scott 
you charge big 
you dive small 
then you emerge big 
ow 
ah 
ow 
useless 
when you re small energy is compressed
so you have the force of a 200 pound man
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide
you re like a bullet 
you punch too hard 
you kill someone 
too soft  it s a love tap 
in other words you have
to know how to punch 
i was in prison for three years 
i know how to punch 
show me 
  terrible 
  you want to show me how to punch 
show me 
that s how you punch 
  she s been looking forward to this 
  no kiddin  
hope trained in martial arts
at a  uh  difficult time 
oh  by difficult time  he
means when my mother died 
we lost her in a plane crash 
it s bad enough you won t tell me how she died 
could you please stop telling me that lie 
we re working here 
all right princess 
let s get back to work 
were you going for the hand 
you know  i think this regulator
is holding me back 
do not screw with the regulator 
if that regulator is compromised
you would go sub atomic 
what does that mean 
it means that you would
enter a quantum realm 
what does that mean 
it means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant as you
shrink for all eternity 
everything that you know 
and love 
gone forever 
cool  yeah  i m 
if it ain t broke 
you ve learned about the suit  but you ve
yet to learn about your greatest allies
the ants 
loyal  brave  and
your partners on this job 
paratrechina longicornis 
commonly known as crazy ants 
they re lightning fast and can conduct
electricity which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics 
oh you re not so crazy 
hey   heh heh heh
you re cute 
oh  aaah 
that was a lot scarier
a second ago 
aaah 
it looks like the futures lab has
its own isolated power supply 
there s a security guard posted
around the clock  we need you
to take him out to deactivate
the security systems 
okay 
who s next 
paraponera clavata 
i know  bullet ants  right 
number one on the schmidt pain index 
hey guys 
remember me from the bedroom 
whoa 
the yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed
and the only access point is a tube
we estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter 
why do i have a sick feeling in my stomach 
the tube is protected by a laser grid
and we can only power that down
for fifteen seconds 
you re going to need to signal the crazy ants
to blow the servers  retrieve the suit 
and exit the vaults  before the backup power comes on 
camponotus pennsylvanicus 
alternatively known as a carpenter ant 
ideal for ground and air transport 
wait a minute  i know this guy 
i m going to call him antony 
that s good  that s  that s very good
because this time
you re really going to have
to learn how to control him 
tell them to put the sugar in the teacup 
oh  you okay dr  
ah 
ah  
hank wants you outside
for target practice 
the suit has no weapons
so i made you these discs 
red shrinks 
blue enlarges 
solenopsis mandibularis 
known for their bite  the fire ants
have evolved into remarkable architects 
they are handy to get you
in and out of difficult places 
you can do it scott  come on 
they re not listening to me 
you have to commit 
you have to mean it 
no shortcuts  no lies 
throwing insults into the mix will not
do anyone any good  hope 
we don t have time for coddling 
our focus should be on helping scott 
really 
is that where our focus should be 
hope 
i don t know why i came
to you in the first place 
we can t do this without her 
oh god 
you gotta lock your doors 
i mean  really 
there s some weird folks
in this neighborhood 
do you think this is a joke 
do you have any idea what
he s asking you to risk 
  you have a daughter 
  i m doing this for her 
you know when my mother died
i didn t see him for two weeks 
he was in grief 
yeah  so was i  and i was seven 
and he never came back  not
in any way that counted 
he just sent me off to boarding school 
you know  i thought 
with all that s at stake 
just maybe we might
have a chance at making peace 
but even now he still
wants to shut me out 
he doesn t want to shut you out 
  he trusts you 
  then why are you here 
it proves that he loves you 
hope  look at me 
i m expendable 
that s why i m here 
you must ve realized that by now 
i mean  that s why i m
in the suit and you re not 
he d rather lose than fight
than lose you 
anyway 
you know  i didn t know you had a
daughter when i called the cops on you 
what s her name 
cassie 
it s a pretty name 
you have to clear your mind  scott 
you have to make your thoughts precise 
that s how it works 
think about cassie 
about how badly you want to see her 
and use that to focus 
open your eyes and just think
about what you want the ants to do 
good 
your mother convinced me to let
her join me on my missions 
they called her the wasp 
she was born to it 
and there s not a day that goes by
that i don t regret having said yes 
it was 1987 
separatists had hijacked a
soviet missile silo in kursk
and launched an icbm at the united states 
the only way to the internal mechanics
was through solid titanium 
i knew i had to shrink between the
molecules to disarm the missile 
but my regulator had sustained
too much damage 
your mother  she didn t hesitate 
janet  no 
she turned off her regulator
and went sub atomic
to deactivate the bomb 
she was gone 
your mom died a hero 
and i spent the next ten years
trying to learn all i could
about the quantum realm 
you were trying to bring her back 
but all i learned
was we know nothing 
it s not your fault 
she made her choice 
but why didn t you tell me this sooner 
i was trying to protect you 
i lost your mother 
i didn t mean to lose you too 
i m sorry 
this is awesome 
it s awesome  y know 
you guys are breaking down walls 
you re healing 
it s important 
i ruined the moment didn t i 
yes  you did  yes 
i m going to make some tea 
nailed it 
that s a good boy  antony 
the final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion 
it s freezing 
you couldn t make a simple flannel lining 
we must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy 
it s a device that i invented
from my shield days 
we need it to counteract the transmission blockers
that cross installed in the futures vault 
it s currently collecting dust in one of
howard stark s old storage facilities
in upstate new york 
should be a piece of cake 
you re over the target area 
disengage  now  scott 
squadron a  go 
b  go 
c  go 
all right  antony  please
don t drop me this time 
ah  it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this 
stay calm 
uh  guys  we might
have a problem 
hank  didn t you say this
was some old warehouse 
it s not 
you son of a bitch 
scott  get out of there 
abort  abort now 
no  it s okay  it doesn t
look like anyone s home 
antony  get me to the roof 
he s gonna lose the suit 
he s gonna lose his life 
all right i m on the roof
of the target building 
somebody s home  scott 
what s going on down there  sam 
it s the falcon 
i had a sensor trip but
i m not seeing anything 
wait a second 
abort scott  abort now 
it s okay 
he can t see me 
i can see you 
he can see me 
hi  i m scott 
did he just say  hi i m scott  
what are you doing here 
first off 
i m a big fan 
 preciate it  so who the hell are you 
i m ant man 
ant man 
what  you haven t heard of me 
nah  you wouldn t have heard of me 
you want to tell me what you want 
i was hoping i could grab a
piece of technology
just for a few days  and return it 
i need it to save the world 
you know how that is 
i know exactly how that is 
located the breach 
bringing him in 
sorry about this 
what the hell are you doing 
breach is an adult male who
has some sort of shrinking tech 
sorry about that  sorry 
that s enough 
antony  a little help 
i ve lost visual 
he s inside my pack 
sorry 
you seem like a really great guy 
it s really important to me that
cap never finds out about this 
that was completely irresponsible
and dangerous 
you jeopardized everything 
you got it 
well done 
wait a minute 
did you just compliment me 
he did  didn t he 
kinda sounded like he did 
i was good  wasn t i 
hey  how about the fact that i
fought an avenger  and didn t die 
now let s not dwell on the past 
we gotta finish our planning 
don t mind him 
you did good 
darren 
how the hell d you get in here 
you left the front door open  hank 
it s official  you re old 
the plans 
he will kill him 
well to what do i owe this pleasure 
i have good news 
really 
what s that 
pym tech 
the company you created 
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world 
we re anticipating 15 billion
in sales tomorrow alone 
you re welcome 
i know this is odd  but
i d like you to be there 
this is my moment 
i want you to see it 
sure  darren  yeah  sure 
i ll be there 
what did you see in me 
i don t know what you mean 
all those years ago 
you picked me 
what did you see 
i saw myself 
then why did you push me away 
because i saw too much of myself 
he knows  he s baiting you 
we have to call it off 
we re all taking risks 
what if he saw me here 
he didn t  there s no way 
how do you know that 
darren  hi 
hope 
where are you right now 
i m at home  why 
i just saw hank 
i still get nothing but
contempt from him 
don t let him rile you up  he s just   
he s a senile old man 
we need to start everyone
working around the clock 
get the assembly line up and running 
and i m tripling security 
full sensors at all entrances  and
exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh 
great  good idea 
thank you  hope 
i m so lucky to have you on my team 
he s tripling security  he s lost his mind 
and he s on to you 
but he s not on to you 
he s adding full body scanners to all
entrances and closing exterior vents 
how are we gonna get scott inside 
the water main 
you can t add security to a water main 
the pressure is too strong  but if
we can decrease it  that s how i get in 
somebody would have to reach the building s
control center to change the water pressure 
i mean  hank and i will be beside cross 
how are we supposed to do that 
so we expand our team 
what do we need 
a fake security guard on the inside
to depressurize the water system 
somebody else to hack into the power supply
and kill the laser grid 
and a getaway guy 
no  no  no  no no 
not those three wombats  no way 
thank you for the coffee ma am 
it s not too often that you rob a place 
and then get welcomed back 
because we just robbed you 
you know that he was arrested for
stealing a smoothie machine  right 
two smoothie machines 
are you sure they can handle this 
oh we can handle it 
we re professionals 
you ll forgive us if we re
not instilled with confidence 
wait  everybody  just kick back
and relax a little bit  man 
we know our business 
we broke into this spooky ass
house  didn t we 
i let you 
well  one could say
that i let you let me 
look  it s okay 
they can handle this 
yeah  we can handle it 
you got their credentials 
he s in the system 
i m in the system 
the system 
the system 
yeah  we re doomed 
all right  there s something
you guys need to see 
when you get to this corner  there s
gonna be three offices on your left side 
damn 
whoa  that s so cool  bro 
now look

  sorcery 
how d you do that bro 
don t freak out  look at your shoulder 
ahh    ahh   
i thought daddy didn t get scared 
i gave them each half a xanax and
hank explained the science of the suit to them 
fell right asleep 
hey  look  i want to thank you for 
no  please don t 
we re all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us 
i m just glad that you might have a
slight chance of maybe pulling this off 
hey  thank you  you know 
for that pep talk 
you know  the honest truth is i actually went
from despising you to almost liking you

  wait 
  what  what d you mean wait 
what  what 
hello guy 
heh heh heh heh heh 
oh sh  gah 
i always suspected you had a
suit stored away somewhere 
which begs the question 
who is the new ant man 
who is the man that my beloved
mentor trusted even more than me 
scott lang 
the martyr 
he took on the system
and paid the price 
losing his family and his only
daughter in the process 
exactly your kind of guy  hank 
he escapes his jail cell without
leaving any clue as to how 
and then 
he disappears magically 
despite having no money to his name 
and now he brings me the ant man suit 
the only thing that can rival my creation 
darren  don t do this 
if you sell to these men 
it s going to be chaos 
i already have  and for twice
the price  thanks to you 
it s not easy to successfully
infiltrate an avengers facility 
thankfully  word travels fast 
oh i ll sell them the yellowjacket but
i m keeping the particle to myself 
they don t run on diesel 
if you want the fuel you ll
have to come to me 
what do you call the only man who can arm
the most powerful weapon in the world 
the most powerful man in the world 
you proud of me yet 
you can stop this  darren 
it s not too late 
it s been too late for
a long time now 
darren 
what are you doing 
he wasn t any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me 
this is not who you are  it s the
particles altering your brain chemistry 
wait  wait wait wait wait wait wait 
you re right 
i have to be the one to do it 
here we go 
drop  your  gun 
you know i came to the house
the other night to kill him
but you were there 
you re sick and i can help you
just put the gun down 
i wasn t ready to kill you then 
but i think i am now 
drop your gun now 
you picked the wrong side  hope 
dad 
hank  no  no  hank 
hank  listen  you re gonna be okay 
all right  you re gonna be just fine

your brains out and peel it off

request immediate backup 
go  go  go 
get me to the roof
