youre supposed to be in moscow
i took a detour
through your defense lab
tell me that isnt
what i think it is
it depends if you think its a
poor attempt to replicate my work
even for this group
that takes nerve
you were instructed to go to russia
may i remind you dr pym that
youre a soldier
im a scientist
then act like one
the pym particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed
help us put it to good use
first you trim me to your errand boy
and now you try to steal my research
if only youd protected janet
with such ferocity dr pym
ah
easy hank
you mention my wife again
and ill show you ferocity
dont look at me
you said it
i formally tender my resignation
we dont accept it formally
hank
we need you
the pym particle is a miracle please
dont let your past
determine the future
as long as i am alive
nobody will ever get that formula
we shouldnt let him
leave the building
youve already lied to him
now you want to go to war with him
yes
our scientists havent come
close to replicating his work
he just kicked your ass full size
you really want to find out what its

my cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago
about this little perfect job
no way
no no no wait  this guy
this guy fits your mo
no
im finished man im not
going back to jail
its some retired millionaire living
off his golden parachute
its a perfect scott lang mark
i dont care im out
dr pym
yes im still alive
id
perhaps that will suffice
very sorry sir please come in
is that hank pym
good morning hank
hope
would it kill you to call me dad
well dr cross will be so please that
you could find time to join us today
more like thrilled
and im surprised to receive any
kind of invitation from you darren
whats the occasion
oh youll see
wont he hope
were ready for you inside
ouch
i guess some old wounds never heal huh
dont worry shes in good hands
youre in for a treat
long time no see dr pym
hows retirement
hows your face
after you
now before we start id like to
introduce a very special guest
this companys founder and my mentor
dr hank pym
when i took over this company for dr pym
i immediately started researching a particle
that could change the distance between atoms
while increasing density and strength
why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the
dust and cobwebs of hanks research i couldnt tell you
but just imagine
a soldier the size of an insect
the ultimate secret weapon
an antman
heh heh
thats what they called you
right hank
silly i know  propaganda
tales to astonish
trumped up bs to scare the ussr
hank will you tell our guests what you
told me every single time i asked you
was the antman real
just a tall tale
right
because how could anything so
miraculous possibly be real
well i was inspired by the legend of the antman
and with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material
i thought could it be possible to shrink a person
could that be done
well
its not a legend anymore
distinguished guests i am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it
the yellowjacket
the yellowjacket is an allpurpose
weapon of war
capable of altering the size of the wearer
for the ultimate combat advantage
we live in an era in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves
are undermined by constant surveillance
its time to return to a simpler age
only when the powers of freedom can once
again operate openly to protect their interests
an allpurpose peacekeeping vessel the yellowjacket
can manage any conflict on the geopolitical landscape
completely unseen
efficient in both preventative
measures and tactical assault
practical applications include surveillance
industrial sabotage
and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace
a single yellowjacket offers the user unlimited
influence to carry out protective actions
and one day soon an army of yellowjackets
will create a sustainable environment
of wellbeing around the world
the yellowjacket
so its a suit
dont be crude frank
its not a suit its a
its a vessel
whats a matter youre not impressed
oh im impressed  im also concerned
imagine what our enemies could do with this tech
we should have a longer conversation about
that frank  i really value your opinion
thank you for coming hope
thank you very much everybody
i will escort you out now  thank you
you seem a bit shocked
darren
theres a reason that i buried these secrets
so you finally admit it
we couldve done this together hank
but you ruined it
thats why youre the past and im the future
dont do this
dr cross
you sell to me first twenty
percent of your asking price
i can have the cash here in two weeks
deal
we have to make our move hank
how close is he
he still cant shrink a live subject
just give me the suit let me
finish this once and for all
no
i have crosss complete trust
its too dangerous
we dont have a choice
well thats not entirely true
i think i found a guy
who
daddy
peanut
oh happy birthday
im so sorry im late i didnt know
what time your party started
it was on the invitation
he didnt get an invitation
but he came anyway
well im not going to miss my
little girls birthday party
im gonna go tell mommy youre here
oh you dont
what are you doing here lang
you havent paid a dime in child support
you know right now if i wanted to
i could arrest you
good to see you too paxton
mommys so happy youre here
she choked on her drink  ha ha
hey look what i have for you

youre my bestest friend
what is that thing
hes so ugly
i love him

when you have a record
im sure youll figure it out but yknow
i want you out of my house
no wait its my daughters birthday
its my house
so what its my kid
relax
you cant just show up here
you know that cmon
its a birthday party
yeah i know but you
cant just show up
shes my daughter
you dont know the first thing about being a father
maggie i tell you this as a friend
and as the first love of my life
your fiance is an asshat
hes not an asshat
hey watch your language okay
oh what language
i said hat
really maggie
that guy
come on you could marry anyone you want
you have to get engaged to a cop
at least hes not a crook
im trying okay  ive changed uh
im straight i had a job and
i want to provide  ive had a lot of time
to think about it and i love her
so much  ive missed so much time and
i want to be a part of her life
what do i do
get an apartment
get a job pay child support
and then we will talk about
visitation i promise
youre her hero scott
just be the person that she
already thinks you are
musical horn
im sorry you have such deep concerns
about the yellowjacket frank
yeah well uh unfortunately
we cant just do whatever we want
would be nice though right
heh heh heh
but there are laws
what laws of man
the laws of nature transcend
the laws of man
and ive transcended
the laws of nature
darren i dont think you understand
we still havent worked out all the bugs
goodbye frank
you know ive been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately
and today during my morning meditation an
interesting thought occurred to me and
i think it might apply to you too
hows that
gratitude can be forgiveness
i spent years carrying around my
anger for hank pym
i devoted my genius to him
i couldve worked anywhere
i chose my mentor poorly
you didnt even have a choice
he never believed in you
its a shame what we had to do
but he forced us to do it didnt he
but we shouldnt be angry
we should be grateful
because his failures as a mentor
as a father
forced us to spread our wings
youre a success darren
you deserve everything coming your way
ooh
stop cheating
hey whats up hotshot
maybe he didnt hear you
how was the party
tell me about that tip
wha
i wanna know about that tip
oh baby its on
hot dog
its so on right now
calm down all right i just need
to know where it came from
its gotta be airtight
okay
i was at a wine tasting with my cousin ernesto
it was mainly reds and you know
i dont love reds man yknow but
there was a rosé that saved the
day it was delightful
and he tells me about this girl
emily that we used to kick it with
it was actually the first pair of
boobs that i ever touched
its the wrong details  its wro
has nothing to do with the story
go
so uh  he tells me that
shes working as a housekeeper now right
and shes dating this dude carlos whos
a shot caller from across the bay and
she tells him about the dude that
shes cleaning for right
that hes like this bigshot ceo that
is all retired now but hes loaded
and so carlos and ernesto are
on the same softball team
and the get to talking right
and here comes the good part
carlos says
yo man this guys got a bigass safe
just sitting in the basement
just chillin
of course ernesto comes to me cause
he knows ive got mad thieving skills
of course i ask him
did emily tell carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was
and he says
naw dog all she said is that
its like super legit and
whatevers in it has gotta be good
what
old man have safe
and hes gone for a week
all right  theres an old man hes got
a safe and hes gone for a week
lets just work with that
yknow what i sayin
landlines cut cell signals jammed
no one will be making
for distress call tonight
all check
check
check
if the job goes bad you know
i got your back right
dont worry its not gonna happen
i love it when he gets cocky
damn
alarm is dead
nice
all right im moving through the house
theres a fingerprint lock on the door
hes got a what
ernesto didnt tell me nothing about that
aw man are we screwed
not necessarily
im in
no alarms have been triggered
hes in like the flynn
oh man
what is it
well they werent kidding
this safe is serious
how serious we talkin scotty
its a carbondale
its from 1910
made from the same steel
as the titanic
wow
can you crack it
well heres the thing
it doesnt do so well in the cold
remember what that iceberg did
yeah man it killed dicaprio
killed everybody
man not kill the old lady
she still throw the jewel into the oceans
whatre you doing
i poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen
ice expands metal doesnt
what are you doing now
waiting
waiting
nice

what
its an old motorcycle suit
theres no cash no jewelry nothing
no
its a bust
im really sorry scotty
i know you needed a score
i thought we were using mice
whats the difference
commence experiment 34c
organic atomic reduction
darren maybe we should think
shrinking organic tissue is the
centerpiece of this technology
i cant go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough
experiment 34c results
negative
sanitize the workstation
bring in subject 35c
why would you lock this up
so weird
scott whats up man
i wonderwhat is this
the world sure seems different
from down here doesnt it scott
what whowho said that
luis luis im here
its a trial by fire scott
or in this case
water
guess youre tougher than you thought
oh i dont want to see this
luis
son of a
what the hell
not bad for a test drive
keep the suit
ill be in touch
no no no
no thank you
put it down on the ground
you are under arrest
no i didnt steal anything
i was returning
something i stole
you know you almost had us convinced
that you were going to change your ways
they were really rooting for you
its gonna break their hearts
you got a visitor
who
your lawyer
my lawyer
i told you id be in touch scott
im starting to think that you
prefer the inside of a jail cell
oh man
sit down
sir im sorry i stole the suit
i dont even want to
know why you have it
maggie was right about you
how do you know about
the way shes trying to keep
you away from cassie
the moment things get hard
you turn right back to crime
the way i see it you have a choice
you can either spend the
rest of your life in prison
or go back to your cell
and await further instructions
i dont understand
i dont expect you to
but you dont have many options right now
quite frankly neither do i
why do you think i let you steal
that suit in the first place
what
second chances dont come
around all that much
so next time you think you might see one
i suggest you take a real close look at it
you are my bestest friend
are you sure you dont
want a different toy
no i love this one
okay
well get some sleep then
mommy
hm
is daddy a bad man
i heard some grown ups say hes bad
no
daddy just gets confused
sometimes you know
smart choice
you actually listened for once
under the door
okay where to now
hang tight
what what
where the hell did he go
i have no idea he just vanished
set up a five block perimeter now
get back get back get back
scott these are my associates
huh you got a camera on an ant
yeah sure why not
wheres the car
no car weve got wings
incoming
put your foot on the
central node and not the thorax
are you ki how safes th
get on the damn ant scott
why am i on a police car
shouldnt i not be on a police car
so they can give you a lift
past their five block perimeter
whoa all right
now whats the next move
hang on tight
oh this is easy
im getting the hang of this
yank up to go up
its like a horse
youre throwing 247 off balance
wait his name is 247
he doesnt have a name
he has a number scott do you have
any idea how many ants there are
whoa
pleasemaybe its 248
no no no no no
vertigo vertigo
no i think its 247

i think im getting the hang of this
im controlling 247
he is not listening to you
what

time out
all right hold on
just wait whoa uh
what happens if i

im getting light headed
hang on scott
yeah im getting a little light
ts its funny
hit me andfarness
hello
who are you
have you been standing there
watching me sleep this whole time
yes
why
because the last time you were
here you stole something
oh oh
hey look
whoa
paraponera clavata
giant tropical bullet ants ranked
highest on the schmidt pain index
theyre here to keep an eye
on you when i cant
dr pyms waiting for you downstairs
who
ahhhhey um
whose pajamas are these
how am i supposed to do this
hey j just one step at a time
ugh
you dont bite me
i dont step on you deal
take down the servers and
cross wouldnt even know
we dont need this guy
i assume that youve already
met my daughter hope
i did
shes great
she doesnt think that we need you
we dont we can do this ourselves
i go to all this effort to let you
steal my suit and then hope
has you arrested
okay we can try this and
when he fails ill do it myself
shes a little bit anxious
it has to do with this job
which judging by the fact that
youre sitting opposite me
i take it that youre interested in
what job
would you like some tea
uh sure
i was very impressed with how you
managed to get past my security system
freezing that metal was particularly clever
were you watching me
scott ive been watching you for a while
ever since you robbed vista corp
oh excuse me burgled vista corp
vistas security system is one of the most
advanced in the business
its supposed to be unbeatable
but you beat it
would you like some sugar
yeah thanks
you know what im okay
how do you make them do that
ants can lift objects
fifty times their weight
they build farm they
cooperate with each other
right but how do you
make them do that
i use electromagnetic waves to
stimulate their olfactory nerve center
i speak to them
i can go anywhere hear
anything and see everything
and still know absolutely nothing
im late to meet cross
uhdr pym
you dont need to raise your hand scott
sorry i just have one question
who are you who is she what the hells
going on and can i go back to jail now
come with me
twenty years ago i created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance
huh
i learned how to change the distance
between atoms thats what powers the suit
thats why it works
wow
whoa
it was dangerous
it was too dangerous
so i hid it from the world
and thats when i switched gears
and i started my own company
pym tech
yes
i took on a young protege
called darren cross
darren cross
hes a big deal
but before he was a big deal
he was my assistant
i thought i saw something in him
a son i never had perhaps
he was brilliant but as we became
close he began to suspect
that i wasnt telling him everything
he heard rumors about what
was called the pym particles
and he became obsessed with
recreating my formula
but i wouldnt help him so he
conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company
how could he do that
the boards chairman
is my daughter hope
she was the deciding vote
but she came back to me when she saw
how close cross was to cracking my formula
the process is highly volatile
what isnt protected by a specialized helmet
can affect the brains chemistry
i dont think darren realizes this and yknow
hes not the most stable guy to begin with
so what do you want from me
scott i believe that everyone
deserves a shot at redemption
do you
i do
if you can help me i promise i can
help you be with your daughter again
now are you ready to redeem yourself
absolutely
my days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done
what do you want me to do
i want you to break into a
place and steal some shit
you going to be home for dinner tonight
uh yeah
ill pick something up okay
okay
good news
uh i dont know
its news
are you trying to find my daddy
yeah i am sweetheart
i just want your
daddy to be safe
hope you dont catch him
this isnt the first time these guys
have tried to get their hands
on game changing weaponry
thats mitchell carson
exhead of defense at shield
presently in the business
of toppling governments
he always wanted my tech
and now unless we break in
and steal the yellowjacket
and destroy all the data
darren cross is gonna unleash
chaos upon the world
i think our first move should
be calling the avengers
ive spent half my life trying to keep this
technology out of the hands of a stark
im sure as hell not going to
handdeliver it to one now
this is not some cute technology
like the iron man suit
this could change the texture of reality
besides theyre probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky
okay then why dont you just send the ants
scott they are ants
ants they can do a lot of things
but they still need a leader
somebody that can infiltrate a place
thats designed to prevent infiltration
hank im a thief
all right im a good thief
but this is insane
hes right hank and you know it
youve seen the footage
you know what cross is capable of
i was against using him when we had
months now we have days
im wearing the suit
absolutely not
i know the facility inside and out
i know how cross thinks
i know this mission better
than anybody here
we need you close to cross
otherwise this mission cannot work
we dont have time to screw around
hope please this is an
he is a criminal
im your daughter
no
shes right hank
im not your guy
why dont you wear the suit
you think i dont want to
i cant
i spent years wearing it
it took a toll on me
youre our only option
before hope lost her mother
she used to look at me like
i was the greatest man in the world
and now she looks at me
and its just disappointment
its too late for me
but not for you
this is your chance
the chance to earn that look
in your daughters eyes
to become the hero that she
already thinks you are
its not about saving our world
its about saving theirs
damn that was a good speech
scott
i need you
to be the antman
in the right hands the relationship
between man and suit is symbiotic
the suit has power the man
harnesses that power
you need to be skillful
agile and above all
you need to be fast
you should be able to shrink
and grow on a dime so
your size always suits your needs
now dive through the keyhole scott
you charge big
you dive small
then you emerge big
ow
ah
ow
useless
when youre small energy is compressed
so you have the force of a 200 pound man
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide
youre like a bullet
you punch too hard
you kill someone
too soft its a lovetap
in other words you have
to know how to punch
i was in prison for three years
i know how to punch
show me
terrible
you want to show me how to punch
show me
thats how you punch
shes been looking forward to this
no kiddin
hope trained in martial arts
at a uh difficult time
oh by difficult time he
means when my mother died
we lost her in a plane crash
its bad enough you wont tell me how she died
could you please stop telling me that lie
were working here
all right princess
lets get back to work
were you going for the hand
you know i think this regulator
is holding me back
do not screw with the regulator
if that regulator is compromised
you would go subatomic
what does that mean
it means that you would
enter a quantum realm
what does that mean
it means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant as you
shrink for all eternity
everything that you know
and love
gone forever
cool yeah im
if it aint broke
youve learned about the suit but youve
yet to learn about your greatest allies
the ants
loyal brave and
your partners on this job
paratrechina longicornis
commonly known as crazy ants
theyre lightning fast and can conduct
electricity which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics
oh youre not so crazy
hey  heh heh heh
youre cute
oh aaah
that was a lot scarier
a second ago
aaah
it looks like the futures lab has
its own isolated power supply
theres a security guard posted
around the clock we need you
to take him out to deactivate
the security systems
okay
whos next
paraponera clavata
i know bullet ants right
number one on the schmidt pain index
hey guys
remember me from the bedroom
whoa
the yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed
and the only access point is a tube
we estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter
why do i have a sick feeling in my stomach
the tube is protected by a laser grid
and we can only power that down
for fifteen seconds
youre going to need to signal the crazy ants
to blow the servers retrieve the suit
and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on
camponotus pennsylvanicus
alternatively known as a carpenter ant
ideal for ground and air transport
wait a minute i know this guy
im going to call him antony
thats good thats thats very good
because this time
youre really going to have
to learn how to control him
tell them to put the sugar in the teacup
oh you okay dr
ah
ah
hank wants you outside
for target practice
the suit has no weapons
so i made you these discs
red shrinks
blue enlarges
solenopsis mandibularis
known for their bite the fire ants
have evolved into remarkable architects
they are handy to get you
in and out of difficult places
you can do it scott come on
theyre not listening to me
you have to commit
you have to mean it
no shortcuts no lies
throwing insults into the mix will not
do anyone any good hope
we dont have time for coddling
our focus should be on helping scott
really
is that where our focus should be
hope
i dont know why i came
to you in the first place
we cant do this without her
oh god
you gotta lock your doors
i mean really
theres some weird folks
in this neighborhood
do you think this is a joke
do you have any idea what
hes asking you to risk
you have a daughter
im doing this for her
you know when my mother died
i didnt see him for two weeks
he was in grief
yeah so was i and i was seven
and he never came back not
in any way that counted
he just sent me off to boarding school
you know i thought
with all thats at stake
just maybe we might
have a chance at making peace
but even now he still
wants to shut me out
he doesnt want to shut you out
he trusts you
then why are you here
it proves that he loves you
hope look at me
im expendable
thats why im here
you mustve realized that by now
i mean thats why im
in the suit and youre not
hed rather lose than fight
than lose you
anyway
you know i didnt know you had a
daughter when i called the cops on you
whats her name
cassie
its a pretty name
you have to clear your mind scott
you have to make your thoughts precise
thats how it works
think about cassie
about how badly you want to see her
and use that to focus
open your eyes and just think
about what you want the ants to do
good
your mother convinced me to let
her join me on my missions
they called her the wasp
she was born to it
and theres not a day that goes by
that i dont regret having said yes
it was 1987
separatists had hijacked a
soviet missile silo in kursk
and launched an icbm at the united states
the only way to the internal mechanics
was through solid titanium
i knew i had to shrink between the
molecules to disarm the missile
but my regulator had sustained
too much damage
your mother she didnt hesitate
janet no
she turned off her regulator
and went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb
she was gone
your mom died a hero
and i spent the next ten years
trying to learn all i could
about the quantum realm
you were trying to bring her back
but all i learned
was we know nothing
its not your fault
she made her choice
but why didnt you tell me this sooner
i was trying to protect you
i lost your mother
i didnt mean to lose you too
im sorry
this is awesome

the final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion
its freezing
you couldnt make a simple flannel lining
we must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy
its a device that i invented
from my shield days
we need it to counteract the transmission blockers
that cross installed in the futures vault
its currently collecting dust in one of
howard starks old storage facilities
in upstate new york
should be a piece of cake
youre over the target area
disengage now scott
squadron a go

from sugar cubes to this
stay calm

you want to tell me what you want
i was hoping i could grab a
piece of technology
just for a few days and return it
i need it to save the world
you know how that is
i know exactly how that is
located the breach
bringing him in
sorry about this
what the hell are you doing
breach is an adult male who
has some sort of shrinking tech
sorry about that sorry
thats enough
antony a little help
ive lost visual
hes inside my pack
sorry
you seem like a really great guy
its really important to me that
cap never finds out about this
that was completely irresponsible
and dangerous
you jeopardized everything
you got it
well done
wait a minute
did you just compliment me
he did didnt he
kinda sounded like he did
i was good wasnt i
hey how about the fact that i
fought an avenger and didnt die
now lets not dwell on the past
we gotta finish our planning
dont mind him
you did good
darren
how the helld you get in here
you left the front door open hank
its official youre old
the plans
he will kill him
well to what do i owe this pleasure
i have good news
really
whats that
pym tech
the company you created
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world
were anticipating 15 billion
in sales tomorrow alone
youre welcome
i know this is odd but
id like you to be there
this is my moment
i want you to see it
sure darren yeah sure
ill be there
what did you see in me
i dont know what you mean
all those years ago
you picked me
what did you see
i saw myself
then why did you push me away
because i saw too much of myself
he knows hes baiting you
we have to call it off
were all taking risks
what if he saw me here
he didnt theres no way
how do you know that
darren hi
hope
where are you right now
im at home why
i just saw hank
i still get nothing but
contempt from him
dont let him rile you up hes just
hes a senile old man
we need to start everyone
working around the clock
get the assembly line up and running
and im tripling security
full sensors at all entrances and
exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh
great good idea
thank you hope
im so lucky to have you on my team
hes tripling security hes lost his mind
and hes on to you
but hes not on to you
hes adding full body scanners to all
entrances and closing exterior vents
how are we gonna get scott inside
the water main
you cant add security to a water main
the pressure is too strong but if
we can decrease it thats how i get in
somebody would have to reach the buildings
control center to change the water pressure
i mean hank and i will be beside cross
how are we supposed to do that
so we expand our team
what do we need
a fake security guard on the inside
to depressurize the water system
somebody else to hack into the power supply
and kill the laser grid
and a getaway guy
no no no no no
not those three wombats no way
thank you for the coffee maam
its not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back
because we just robbed you
you know that he was arrested for
stealing a smoothie machine right

hello dr cross
my associates agree to your terms

mr carson introduced me to
these fine gentlemen here

theyre not what they were
theyre doing some interesting work
and im enjoying myself
you tried to hide your technology from me

of this disgusting van
get out
take it easy
go go now
wait
what what dyou mean wait
what what
hello guy
heh heh heh heh heh
oh sh gah
i always suspected you had a
suit stored away somewhere
which begs the question
who is the new antman
who is the man that my beloved
mentor trusted even more than me
scott lang
the martyr
he took on the system
and paid the price
losing his family and his only
daughter in the process
exactly your kind of guy hank
he escapes his jail cell without
leaving any clue as to how
and then
he disappears magically
despite having no money to his name
and now he brings me the antman suit
the only thing that can rival my creation
darren dont do this
if you sell to these men
its going to be chaos
i already have and for twice
the price thanks to you
its not easy to successfully
infiltrate an avengers facility
thankfully word travels fast
oh ill sell them the yellowjacket but
im keeping the particle to myself
they dont run on diesel
if you want the fuel youll
have to come to me
what do you call the only man who can arm
the most powerful weapon in the world
the most powerful man in the world
you proud of me yet
you can stop this darren
its not too late
its been too late for
a long time now
darren
what are you doing
he wasnt any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me
this is not who you are its the
particles altering your brain chemistry
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
youre right
i have to be the one to do it
here we go
drop your gun
you know i came to the house
the other night to kill him
but you were there
youre sick and i can help you
