you out of it here
and just talk about
women in general
im a generous person carl

but
when it comes to you and
me were dealing with
roles that i hate
i dont want to be the man
whilst youre the woman
i want us to be best friends
i dont wanna sleep with
my best friend

stereotypical genderbased roles
that everyone else
seems to be doing
i want us to be equal
car door closes

where i do feel used
i use you

then yeah maybe
there is a point
are you being serious
i got you this shirt
i invited you for dinner
youre staying at my hotel
well you got this
shirt for free
and actually you didnt
pay for dinner
thats because my
card didnt work
theres a cash machine
in the lobby ill pay you
back every last cent
its okay
carl i always intended
to pay you back
i didnt realize you
wanted the money right
now before going to bed
so your intention
was to pay me back
yes
really
yeah
so why did you take
the 50euro bill
once i realized you didnt have
enough cash i paid the bill
instead of giving
me the 50euro bill you put
it back in your purse

woman the success of a
luxury cruise mainly
depends on two moments
number one the first hours
the guests are onboard
and number two the last day
the guests are onboard
and if we can impress them
on those two occasions
then the cruise will probably
be a success
and i dont want to hear
anybody saying
we dont need to uncover
the sundeck they all leave
after breakfast

tannoy chimes
thomas how people
perceive themselves is
nothing that interests me
there are very few
that are gonna look in
the mirror and say
the person i see
is a savage monster
instead they make up
some construction that
justifies what they do
and there it is
youre rich so youre a
philanthropist so you
can cure your conscience
for not paying enough in tax
not contributing
enough to society
screaming
child mama mama
paula ow shit

bring the light
okay
and i recall i was seven years
old walking into the kitchen
to find my mother
crying inconsolably
martin luther king
had been shot
two months later she was crying
again bobby kennedy was killed
i couldnt know then what i know
now that the invisible thread
connecting martin luther king
the kennedy brothers
and malcolm x
was that in each case
my government had their
finger on the trigger
wait wait
but every
switches on tannoy
dimitry say it again
my government murdered
martin luther king malcolm x
bobby kennedy
and john f kennedy
my government overthrew
good honest democratic leaders
of the people in chile
venezuela argentina peru
el salvador nicaragua
panama and bolivia
along with britain
we carved up the middle east
creating artificial
geographical boundaries
and installing
puppet dictators
war itself became
our most lucrative industry
every bomb thats dropped
somebody makes a
million dollars
you dont have to know
where those bombs are exploding
you dont have to see
the grieving mothers
and the mangled bodies
of their children

okay to kill a donkey
it may be a great achievement
but theres one thing
thats so much greater
yaya to paint
to paint yes
to paint a donkey
yaya yes
all cheering
whooping
jarmo lets take a look
at the expression
who did this one
yaya me
okay the feet are
close close together
this donkey wants
to be in control
but it looks almost scared
you want to tell
this donkey to
to not be so scared
to lose control and bound away
across the fields
wildly waving its tail
sure it will make mistakes
carl what are you doing
huh
yaya carl
yeah
what are you doing
with your hand
carl which one
seriously
im just resting
it on the chair
why is your hand
under her jacket on a chair
carl what
it was just
i dont know it was there
resting on the side
of the chair
distant thunder
abigail im coming
im coming
im coming
oh i cant concentrate
oh god
okay you know
if you cant handle it
just tell me nobodys
forcing you to do anything
its just all this fucking
sneaking around and hiding
things from everyone
its too much its
its becoming unbearable
i mean theyre obviously
not happy with what
were doing in here
okay so lets just
tell them the truth
you give me something and i
give you something in return
you realize what position
that puts me in
no
well just because its
more open that youre
a flesh peddler
it doesnt mean
theyre gonna accept the fact
that youre buying sex
with the common food
wow
oh come on i didnt
do you know the amount of work
i put into this island
i go fishing every day
i make fire
i know i know
im responsible
for everybody here
i know im sorry i know
shouldnt that give
me an advantage
yeah yeah of course
okay
you deserve to do
what you want i know
the absurd thing is that
if we were a couple
they wouldnt care
what we did in here
but really maybe we
should just do that maybe
we should just get on with it
i dont know kiss a little
bit in public and hold hands
surely that would be easier
what about yaya
i would have a conversation
with yaya i would have to
be an adult about it
and figure it out but
i think it would be easier
for her probably
i mean shes having to deal
with all this gossip as well
carl i i dont know
do you want me
to break up with yaya
no
no
thats your decision not mine
im not asking you to do it
im just seeing what
you think about it
i know but that doesnt
mean that you can put me
inbetween the two of you
okay okay
its kind of a perfect
scenario for you i mean
you get what you want
you have no obligations
no responsibilities you know
why do you have to make
everything so complicated
because i feel like i
need to know where
this is going abigail
lets just have fun
no but i need to try to deal
with this situation
i i dont wanna piss off
i dont wanna annoy
anyone anymore
do you remember what you said
the first night you were here
what did you say
i love you you give me fish
exactly
and do you know why
that is so beautiful
no
like you
why
because its the truth
so nelson youre
a pirate huh
come on stop it
in den wolken
okay if i was a pirate
what would you ask me
how much money do you make
yeah of course
i dont know
like 3000 euros
on one attack
yeah one attack
if we succeed
so you work on commission huh

the client is making all money
yeah but you can make more
if you have your own boat
3000 euros
