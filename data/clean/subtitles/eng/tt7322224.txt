to talk about money 
okay  but then why is that 
i don t know

in the restaurant didn t
even have prices for you 
that s not fair  carl 
  i m always paying 
  no  no  no  let s take
you out of it here 
and just talk about
women in general 
i m a generous person  carl 
ask any of my friends 
sure you re generous  but   
but 
when it comes to you and
me  we re dealing with
roles that i hate 
i don t want to be the man 
whilst you re the woman 
i want us to be best friends 
  i don t wanna sleep with
my best friend 
  no  that s not   
you don t understand what

i got you this shirt 
i invited you for dinner 
  you re staying at my hotel

shirt for free

back every last cent   
it s okay 
carl  i always intended
to pay you back 
i didn t realize you
wanted the money right
now before going to bed 
  so your intention
was to pay me back 
  yes 
  really 
  yeah 
so why did you take
the 50 euro bill

enough cash  i paid the bill 
instead of giving
me the 50 euro bill  you put

 woman   the success of a
luxury cruise mainly
depends on two moments 
 number one  the first hours
the guests are onboard 
 and number two  the last day
the guests are onboard

on those two occasions 
 then the cruise will probably
be a success

anybody saying 
 we don t need to uncover
the sundeck  they all leave
after breakfast  
no  i want full set up

russian capitalist pig 
 i m not angry with you 
it s like karl marx said 
  anything human is
not alien to me  
 and i understand that
your greedy behavior
is just the result
 of your position
in a financial hierarchy 
 that you re rich 
that you re filthy rich 
 but you can t be rich 
and expect the rest of
the world to be poor  
and while you re swimming
in abundance 
the rest of the world
is drowning in misery 
that s not the way
it s meant to be 
and i know you have a good
heart in there  somewhere 
you filthy  capitalist 
russian pig 
you have a good heart

 tannoy chimes 
 thomas   how people
perceive themselves is
nothing that interests me 
 there are very few
that are gonna look in
the mirror and say 
  the person i see
is a savage monster   
instead  they make up
some construction that
justifies what they do 
and there it is 
you re rich  so you re a
philanthropist  so you
can cure your conscience
for not paying enough in tax 
 not contributing
enough to society  
 screaming 
 child  mama  mama 
 paula  ow  shit

   jarmo  okay  okay 
  the donkey fairytale   
  yeah  yeah  yeah 
   jarmo  thank you very much 
okay    to kill a donkey 
it may be a great achievement 
but there s one thing
that s so much greater 
   yaya  to paint 
  to paint  yes 
to paint a donkey 
   yaya  yes 
   all cheering 
 whooping 
 jarmo  let s take a look
at the expression 
  who did this one 
   yaya  me 
okay  the feet are
close  close together 
this donkey wants
to be in control 
but it looks almost scared 
you want to tell
this donkey to   
to not be so scared 
to lose control and bound away
across the fields 
wildly waving its tail 
  sure  it will make mistakes   
  carl  what are you doing 
huh 
   yaya  carl 
  yeah 
what are you doing
with your hand 
   carl  which one 
  seriously 
i m just resting
it on the chair 
why is your hand
under her jacket on a chair 
 carl  what    
it was just   
i don t know  it was there 
resting on the side
of    the chair 
 distant thunder 
 abigail  i m coming 
i m coming 
i m coming   
  oh  i can t concentrate   
  oh  god 
okay  you know   
if you can t handle it 
just tell me  nobody s
forcing you to do anything 
it s just all this fucking
sneaking around and hiding
things from everyone 
it s too much  it s   
it s becoming unbearable 
i mean  they re obviously
not happy with what
we re doing in here 
okay  so    let s just   
tell them the truth 
you give me something  and i
give you something in return 
you realize what position
that puts me in 
no 
well  just because it s
more open that you re
a flesh peddler 
it doesn t mean
they re gonna accept the fact
that you re buying sex
with the common food 
wow   
oh  come on  i didn t   
do you know the amount of work
i put into this island 
  i go fishing every day 
i make fire   
  i know  i know 
  i m responsible
for everybody here 
  i know  i m sorry  i know 
  shouldn t that give
me an advantage 
  yeah  yeah  of course 
  okay 
  you deserve to do
what you want  i know 
the absurd thing is that 
if we were a couple 
they wouldn t care
what we did in here 
but  really  maybe we
should just do that  maybe
we should just get on with it 
i don t know  kiss a little
bit in public and hold hands 
  surely that would be easier 
  what about yaya 
i would have a conversation
with yaya  i would have to
be an adult about it 
and figure it out  but   
i think it would be easier
for her  probably 
i mean  she s having to deal
with all this gossip as well 
carl  i    i don t know 
do you want me
to break up with yaya 
  no 
  no 
that s your decision  not mine 
i m not asking you to do it 
i m just seeing what
you think about it 
i know  but that doesn t
mean that you can put me
in between the two of you 
okay  okay 
it s kind of a perfect
scenario for you  i mean   
you get what you want 
you have no obligations 
no responsibilities  you know 
why do you have to make
everything so complicated 
because i feel like i
need to know where
this is going  abigail 
let s just have fun 
no  but i need to try to deal
with this situation 
i    i don t wanna piss off   
i don t wanna annoy
anyone anymore 
do you remember what you said
the first night you were here 
what did you say 
 i love you  you give me fish  
exactly 
and do you know why
that is so beautiful 
  no 
  like you   
  why 
  because it s the truth 
so  nelson    you re
a pirate  huh 
come on  stop it 
in den wolken 
okay  if i was a pirate 
what would you ask me 
how much money do you make 
yeah  of course 
i don t know 
like    3 000 euros 
  on one attack 
  yeah  one attack 
if we succeed 
so  you work on commission  huh 
  yeah 
  shit 
the client is making all money 
yeah  but you can make more
if you have your own boat 
3 000 euros   
come on  you re crazy 
my girlfriend is expensive 
what  you invest in
your girlfriend 
  yeah 
  ah   
you should do it
the other way around 
invest in business  buy a boat 
and the girls will come to you
