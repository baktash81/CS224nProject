their own philosophy
everyone beneath the sun
must find a way
and i have found
the only way for me
i don t believe in
frettin  and grievin 
why mess around with strife
i never was cut out
to step and strut out
give me the simple life
some find it pleasant
dining on pheasant
those things
roll off my knife
just serve me tomatoes
and mashed potatoes
give me the simple life
a cottage small
is all i m after
not one that s spacious
and wide
a house that rings
with joy and laughter
and the one you love
in sight
some like the high road
i like the low road
free from the care
and strife
sounds corny and seedy
but  yes  indeedy
i like the simple life
life could be thrilling
with one who s willing
to be a farmer s wife
kids calling me pappy
would sure make me happy
give me the simple life
some find it pleasant
dining on pheasant
those things
roll off my knife
just serve me tomatoes
and mashed potatoes
give me the simple life
nina  come on  they re gonna
be here any minute 
okay  we ll be right down 
father of the bride 
i never thought i d say this  but that
whole experience pas a piece of cake   
compared to the roller coaster
i ve been on this past year 
i admit it took me a while
to recover from the wedding 
but eventually life got back
to normal  which is exactly
the way i prefer life to be 
after the dust settled  i began
to realize what a lucky guy i was 
i had a wonderful home
filled with memories 
and completely paid for 
a wife i love just as much
as the day i married her 
a daughter  independent 
self sufficient 
married  working  happy 
a son blossoming
in the middle of middle school 
and a son in law
gainfully employed 
and very often 
out of town on business 
life was sweet 
i felt for the first time
ahead of the game 
then it dawned on me 
i was a mere five years
away from freedom 
soon i d be a father with one kid
married and the other off in college 
and that started me
thinking 
what was i gonna do
with all that free time 
anything i wanted 
maybe i d take up
fly fishing 
travel to exotic places 
climb mount everest 
i was feeling
on top of the world 
and that s when
they lowered the boom on me 
it was like that old joke 
  all those who think they have
it made  take one step forward 
not so fast  george banks   
it was about a year ago
when it all started 
well  nine months ago
to be exact 
i was on my way home from work
on a perfect fall day 
the leaves were golden 
the air was crisp 
and i couldn t help thinking
what a charmed life i was leading 
yep  i was a happy man 
hey  hey 
  hey  dad  you hear the news 
  what news 
  i don t know  she wouldn t tell me 
  matty  phone

to be here at 6 00 sharp 
that he and annie have
some important news to tell us

been transferred back east  do you 
no  honey  something tells me
this has nothing to do with work 
george  george  you sure
you don t want a glass of wine 
 cause she always said
a transfer was a possibility 
and i  for one 
would hate it if they moved

far enough away as it is 
dad  they live
a mile from here

  hi 
george  sorry  george 
as long as the big news wasn t that
my daughter was moving 3 000 miles away 
her husband could call me
anything he wanted 
in spite of myself  i had
actually begun to grow somewhat
fond of bryan mackenzie 
those hors d oeuvres
look so great  i m starving 
mm hmm 
so what is it  annie 
what s the news 
  well  don t you wanna eat first 
  come on  tell us  what is it 
  i know what it is 
i got it  i m positive 
  what 
you bought a house  right  a place
you can remodel a little closer to home 
  a house  is that it 
  well  
well  no  no  no  no 
a house is fine 
oh  yeah  of course 
a   a house is definitely good 
that s the big news  a house  man  i
thought you guys were gonna have a baby 
  oh  get outta here 
  us too 
i know  me too 
that s what i thought 
that s what
we were hoping for 
  well  
  tell  em 
your wish came true 
i m gonna have a baby 
  we re pregnant 
  oh 
  congratulations 
  oh  this is so  
  thanks 
i never liked
that bryan mackenzie 
not from the moment
i laid eyes on him 
here my little girl was playing house 
and he had the nerve to  
  george 
  what do you say  dad 
congratulations 
you too 
congratulations 
  oh 
  grandpa 
  grandpa    first that runt
steals my daughter  now he
makes a grandpa out of me 
the baby is due july 26  and i like that
 cause that s a good even number 
of course  it is
going to be very hot 
but i m sure she s not
gonna mind  oh  god  oh  george 
can you believe the same doctor
who delivered annie is going
to be delivering her baby 
  oh  honey  it s so amazing 
  yeah 
oh  george 
i have a great idea 
what if franck did
the baby shower for us 
  franck 
  as a favor  honey  george 
what  i thought
you liked franck now 
  i never actually said
i liked the man 
  yes  you did  yes  you did 
when we were at that party
with those people from whatcha callit 
  you were just raving on about him 
  all right  well  maybe it slipped out 
but i didn t mean it 
nina  get a grip 
i m not gonna go into hock   
to give annie a baby shower 
i just finished
paying for the wedding 
oh  now my stomach hurts 
where d you put my tums 
all right  honey  okay  okay  okay 
it was just a thought  calm down 
what s the matter with you anyway 
you didn t say a word during dinner 
  you re acting as if
you re not happy about this 
  who s acting 
oh  i see  you re not happy that your
daughter is going to be having a baby 
that s right  grandma 
i m not 
  why 
  well  for starters 
they can t afford a baby 
  oh  oh 
  babies cost money 
and the older they get 
the more they cost 
i mean  they didn t plan for this 
they don t have a nest egg 
they   they
barely have a nest 
how are they gonna fit a baby
into that shoe box they live in 
really  george  they have more money
than we had at their age 
also  what do they know
about raising a kid 
annie s just a kid herself  i
mean  she graduates college and
marries the first guy she meets 
and now to get saddled with a baby
even before her career takes off 
why must i always be the only
feminist in this family 
you know  i just
realized something 
i m four foot six 
i don t shave 
i don t have a job 
and i m gonna be an uncle 
is there somethin 
weird about that

who thinks like i do 
oh  yeah

  poor nina  the woman was
obviously living in denial 
  yeah  i know 
  i  for one  wasn t ready
to be a grandfather 
  i know  yeah 
what was so grand
about it anyway 
george  oh  he s thrilled 
  grandfathers wore
cardigans and hearing aids 
  in fact  um  i was just
telling him that   
 i wore baseball caps and running shoes 
 the same doctor who delivered annie  
sure i may have been a little
out of shape  but i was still young 
and i could prove it

we ve lived here 18 years 
i don t know if we can get every  
excuse  please 
uh  you explain that i pay big money
if he sell now  very big bonus 
mr  habib is willing
to pay a generous bonus   
for whatever inconvenience moving
too quickly may cause you  george 
dad  you better
discuss this with mom 
  how generous 
  would  uh 
 15 000 be generous enough 
  we may be making real estate
history here  george 
  oh  yeah 
one  two 
three thousand 
four  five  six 
seven thousand  
i shook the man s hand and
promised to be out in ten days 
careful with the dishes 
only problem was  i didn t
have the nerve to tell nina 
wonderful champagne  george 
dom perignon  what are we celebrating 
i know  that s what i was wondering 
what are we celebrating  dear 
well  it s just the first time
the whole family s been together
since the baby and everything 
  oh 
  oh 
  oh  honey 
  thanks  dad  that s sweet 
oh 
so tell us  have you thought of
any names for the baby yet 
well  if it s a boy  we like
cody  cooper  riley or wyatt 
  wyatt  as in earp 
  yeah 
  y you don t like it  dad 
  well  i like it better than cooper 
  or riley 
  hey  what if it s a girl 
for a girl 
our favorite name is chloe 
  chloe  ooh 
  chloe  it s not even american 
th thank you  matthew  we realize that 
we   we also like phoebe and sophie 
and we re still debating
between lucy and fanny 
y you re not considering
any family names 
yes  isn t the first son supposed to be
named after the paternal grandfather 
well  he doesn t have to be named john 
of course  any name on my side will do 
we have an andrew in the family 
a melville  a jacob 
uh  jake is a great name 
hey  you know what  they don t need any
more suggestions  their list is fine 
you re absolutely right  george 
anything is fine as long
as it goes with mackenzie 
uh  wait a minute  i thought the
baby s last name was gonna be
banks mackenzie with a hyphen 
  wasn t that the deal 
  would you like to go through life   
with the name
cooper banks mackenzie 
kid s gonna sound
like a law firm 
it s an awfully long
last name  george 
hold on  what are we saying 
you re not gonna hyphenate the
last name  when did this happen 
nothing s been decided yet  dad 
it s just that   
we think two last names is a lot
for a little kid to deal with 
and since neither of us
want to forfeit our names 
we ve been coming up
with alternative last names 
your baby s gonna have an alternative
last name  like  what  smith or jones 
  no 
  no  because you can t
make smith or jones from
the letters of our last names 
  right 
  so  
  i don t understand 
what names can you make 
well  the ones we like best
are zineman  zenkman and mannis 
oh  my 
are you telling me i might have
a granddaughter named sophie zenkman 
  yeah 
  look  look  i have
a simple solution here 
george  nina  you already have
matty to carry on the family name 
so  why don t we drop this
banks mackenzie business and   
just go with mackenzie 
  or drop the mackenzie 
  oh  well  now wouldn t that be silly 
well  i don t think that s any
sillier than dropping the banks 
  well  i would venture
to suggest that mackenzie   
  well  i do 
  is a good  solid family name 
  i mean  traditionally  you take  
i mean  the baby s just as much
a banks as it is a mackenzie  isn t it 
  traditionally  
  dad  say something 
  i just don t agree with that 
  change the subject 
  mackenzie is  
  hey  guess what 
i sold the house today 
  what did you say  dear 
  nina  i forgot to tell you 
while you were at the market
this morning  i sold the house 
well  congratulations  gramps 
where are you movin  
well  we don t know exactly for
sure where yet  but  uh  we re
thinking of maybe the beach 
  we don t know exactly
for sure where yet 
  what 
but  george  we haven t
even started looking 
you sold the house  dad 
  why is she crying 
  well  because i never thought   
they were serious
about selling the house 
i m sorry  dad  but i just thought it
was another goofy idea like your hair 
  hey 
  i never thought you were
actually gonna go through with it 
  i love this house 
  well  wow 
i guess i just assumed
we d have a little more warning 
but what do we have 
we have at least 90 days before
we have to move  am i right  george 
oh  believe me  nina  you can jack up
an escrow six months  if you need to 
  matty  what s going on 
  may i be excused 
no  no  sir 
you may not be excused 
  george 
  the guy paid me  15 000 extra
to be out in ten days 
the guy paid you  15 000 extra
to be out of the house in ten days 
  i hope you took it  george 
  he did 
  and he threw in mom s favorite
dishes just to close the deal 
  george 
nina was less than thrilled
about our abbreviated escrow 
but being the great woman
that she is  she went with the flow   
and even allowed me back into
our bedroom for our last night
at 24 maple drive 
and since we had nowhere to
live  she also arranged for us
to stay at the mackenzie s   
  while they took a caribbean cruise 
  honey 
honey  are you sure you don t
want me to take your picture by
your favorite part of the fence 
no  no  i m fine 
oh  okay   oh  whoa 
hey  nina  are you okay

no  i mean  i assume this is
absolutely routine  i don t know  honey

menopause before  you know 
he probably just wants to tell us
what to expect un   well  unless  
  unless what  what  unless what  what

something showed up on my
blood test that was too horrible
to tell me over the phone

support in case i flipped out 
  you know  and he just  like  
  nina  well  what did
the man say exact

i hope 
i d never seen nina
so unglued 
i wasn t used to being

you never wants to have fun 
george  and you never change 
every party has a pooper
that s why we invited you
  party pooper
  party pooper
every party has a pooper
that s why we invited you george banks
  that s you
  it was on the second chorus   
of   every party has a pooper  
that i got woozy again 
next thing i knew  we
were driving through town 
nina was glowing 
she looked so peaceful 
grab your coat
and get your hat
leave your worries
on the doorstep
  you can t get me 
  just direct your feet
  slow down  son 
whoa  whoa  whoa  wait  son 
  whoa  whoa  whoa 
  to the sunny side of the street
can you hear
the pitter pat
  yeah  that happy tune he s whistlin 
  george 
  nina 
  honey  i need to know how
you feel about all this 
  life can be so sweet
  dad  i want a hot dog 
  on the sunny side of the street
  they don t have any hot dogs 
they don t have hot dogs 
  i don t like  
don t  josh  no  no  no 
i feel super about it 
i m totally up for it 
  you are 
  definitely 
oh 
so what do you think  you think we have
the stamina to have a baby 
what do you mean  honey 
for the actual pregnancy 
  well  i know i have
the stamina for that part 
  oh  well  that s a relief 
i m talking about the rest of it 
like the next 18 years part 
but  george  for weeks you ve been
telling me how young you are 
  and you ve been telling me
how old we are 
  well  we re obviously
not too old  honey 
well  nina  let s be honest  i
mean  just because a man wears sneakers 
it doesn t make him a teenager 
i was completely kidding myself 
when i was working out at the gym  there
were 60 year olds more buff than me 
oh  so we re too old for this  ls that
what you re trying to tell me  george 
no  it s just that i was beginning
to feel like we were approaching   
that big parenting
finishing line 
now to be all the way back
at the starting gate 
not to mention  we will be
like the oldest parents ever
at the starting gate 
i mean  let s face it  between us 
we re almost a hundred years old 
but don t get me wrong 
i m into it 
3 00 a m  feedings and diapers and car
seats and mister rogers and vomiting 
  hi 
  hi 
hi  sweetie  hi 
  hi 
  hi 
  hi  guys 
  hi 
  hi 
  everything go okay 
oh  oh 
so what s going on 
what d the doctor say 
is that  uh  tv still on the blink 
because i have time now  i  
  dad 
  okay 
  well  he  uh  
  mom  you can tell me  i m a big girl 
well  honey  as it turns out 
my  my blood tests are fine 
  good 
  yeah  and i m not even
going through menopause 
  i thought you were too young for that 
  yeah  well  i don t know 
so what is it 
did he find anything 
well  actually  he did  didn t he 
he did find a little something 
he did  what 
believe it or not 
your father and i  
  we re going to have a baby 
  we re pregnant 
you guys 
that is so unfunny 
i mean  can you imagine
if that were true 
i mean  you couldn t be 
you re serious 
you re really pregnant 
i m due september 4 
labor day 
perfect timing  huh  labor day 
you know  we should go now 
  mom  you re pregnant 
  well  honey 
it s not something we planned  sometimes
these things  they just happen 
who knew  you know 
it was a rainy afternoon 
and  uh  your mom and i were
all alone in the house 
then  uh  one thing leads to another 
and then the next thing you know  hey 
  daddy 
  at that moment  i wanted to
crawl under the sofa and die 
you old son of a gun 
  son of a gun   
i wish i had a gun 
if it wasn t for this kid
coming into our lives  none of
this would ever have happened 
  it s okay 
  gee  i don t know what to say 
  that s okay 
  i just never thought we d both
be pregnant at the same time 
  yeah  well 
  i m not crying because i m
sad  really  because i m not 
  no  what s   well  
  i gotta get a kleenex 
annie  oh 
annie  don t   don t cry  honey 
she s been kind of
emotional lately 
so  our kids will be what 
not brother and sister  that s wrong 
oh  no  no  no  no 
their kid will be your brother
or sister and our kid s cousin 
no  your kid s
uncle or aunt 
yeah  but our kid will probably
be more comfortable calling us
grandma and grandpa   
just like your kid  you know  at
least in front of his friends 
you know   cause let s face it 
we re gonna be in our fifties
when he s in preschool 
in our sixties 
when he graduates college 
but  you know  that ll be great
to see another kid in cap and gown 
you know  if we can
still see by then 
now  at least going to the movies 
that ll be economical 
  one child  two seniors 
thanks   
kid s gonna love spending
his adolescence in a retirement home 
at least he won t have to worry
about us hearing him come in late 
that s right  honey  because
we won t be able to hear  right 
exactly 
you re so hilarious  george  you re so
hilarious  you re so sensitive 
and i really appreciate you
asking me how i feel about
all this  especially since   
i m the one who s going
to be having the baby 
you re right 
how do you feel about it 
i know how old i am  george  i ve
already been the mother of the bride 
but here i am at the age i am 
and i m pregnant 
and  you know  i don t
think that qualifies me for
the guinness book of records  george 
so in answer to your question 
i m very happy 
i m happy and
i m feeling nervous   
and i m just
very much alone 
well  anyway 
good bye  sweetie 
i ve gotta go  yeah 
and thank you so much  bryan 
thank you  thank you 
do me a favor 
don t follow me  banks  no 
i went after her 
but it didn t do much good 
i called her  but she refused
to pick up the phone 
calling me   banks  
was never a good sign 
fortunately  my daughter was kind enough
to put her old man up for the night 
but i couldn t sleep 
i was worried i wouldn t
have what it takes 
that i wouldn t be the same
for the next one 
  okay  i miss you

just one last question 
would you mind getting
your wrecking ball off my lawn 
oh  sure  anything you say  george 
you re the boss 
  we go  move out 
  that s right  i m the boss 
so all you guys 
get a move on 
  get that dump truck out of here 
  right away 
  and quit standing on my shutters 
  sorry 
and all of you guys  just pack up
your stuff and hit the road 
and don t trample the pansies 
i laid those bricks 
i planted those pansies 
i painted those shutters 
i broke that window 
i m home 
i m home 
first thing i did
was apologize to nina 
that is not funny  george 
i m not gonna listen to you 
then i told her i bought
the new baby a present 
  that did it  twenty four hours
later  we moved back home 
  george 
before we knew it 
it was spring 
  here you go 
  everything was in full bloom 
including the women
in my life 
hello  oh  hi  honey 
  baby s been kicking a lot 
  annie and nina were
in their second trimesters 
  there was no denying it now 
  yeah  i know we can t sing 
the stork was not only on his way 
he was circling the neighborhood 
still trying
to redeem myself 
i did the unthinkable 
i hired franck to surprise the girls
with a double baby shower 
  it s a baby shower  oh 
  hello  ladies 
what dreams are made of 
look what i have for you 
  it was picture perfect 
  oh  my 
topped off by two surprise
guests flown in for the occasion
all the way from vienna 
  it s a stork 
  oh  my god 
  after the shower 
  thank you 
nina was showing a few of her friends
the new baby s room   
and franck started giving
decorating tips 
but this is what i suggest 
firstly  if it were me 
you know 
what i would do is i d
push those windows out and let
sweet san marino light fill in 
therefore  the third trimester
in the banks family began   
with a remodel of what we
now affectionately called
  the baby s suite   
i ll admit we got a little carried away 
and it wasn t even all franck s fault 
although god knows
i tried to blame him 
  hey  hey 
  no  no  no  no 
nina and annie were doing great 
right on schedule   
and weighing in at 128
and 132 pounds respectively 
ohh  oh 
we had everything you d expect
when you re expecting 
leg cramps  backaches
and cravings 
and the women were worse 
what we didn t expect
one sleepy night   
was an unexpected visitor 
  oh  hi  dad 
  you okay 
i m fine 
bryan and i got in a fight 
and i got angry and got in my car 
i didn t know where to go 
  did i wake mom 
  no  no  no  she s asleep 
so  do you wanna  you know  
yeah  sure  i can talk about it 
it s not  you know   it s fine 
   ca   if you don t wanna  it s okay 
 cause i could just make up the sofa 
  no  no  that s   it s okay 
thanks 
  pretzel 
  no  thanks 
all right 
here s what happened 
when i was leaving work today 
my boss calls me in  tells me
what a great job i m doing   
and says i have as much promise
as anyone she s hired
since she s been at the firm 
then she said the great part  she said
that she s been asked to select   
one person from my level
to be part of a design team   
that s gonna design the new
boston museum of contemporary
art  and she picked me 
  that s fantastic 
  i know  i was completely thrilled 
plus  to live in boston 
i love boston 
  you have to  uh  
  move to boston  yeah 
i need to be there right after
the baby s born  by october 
  uh huh 
  i knew when they hired me   
that this was a possibility
one day  and bryan knew it too 
but now  well   i rush home
to tell him the news  and as soon as
i say the word   boston    his face drops 
i mean  this is the kind of opportunity
everybody dreams about  and we re
talking massachusetts here  not mars 
so bryan doesn t wanna go 
well  he said that he understood
that career wise it was great for me 
but with the baby coming 
he figured i wouldn t wanna go 
  which is  
  ridiculous 
  right 
it s like under that mellow 
 90s gap ad exterior of his   
beats the heart of a 1950s
husband that just expects me to
take a backseat to his career 
  you said that to him 
  of course 
to which he said i was nuts 
and that all he meant was that
with us having a new baby 
it just seemed like a crazy time
to move to sub zero weather
and a city full of strangers 
and that i should think
of you guys   
and of his parents  and how moving so
far away would be so hard on everyone 
anyway  i knew if anybody would
understand how i felt  it would be you 
you were the one that always told me
to go for my dreams  never to settle 
dad  tell me 
am i being unreasonable to want to go 
because if you think i am 
i won t go  i won t 
ann  you have to go 
this is not the dark ages 
we ll still see each other all the time 
you ll just be an airplane ride away 
that s exactly
what i said 
and wasn t bryan the one
who said you were a gifted architect   
  and he d move anywhere you got a job 
  yes 
and wouldn t you move for him if he
was the one being offered the promotion 
in a minute 
oh  gosh  that must be him 
  hi 
  hi 
hi  dad 
um  annie  i i realize
that   that  
did you tell your dad 
sorry  george 
i didn t mean to be so lame 
hey  you guys go ahead 
it s not up to me 
okay  annie  i realized
after you left that  uh 
if the same thing happened to me 
you d come with me anytime  anywhere 
  i would 
  so i wanna do the same for you 
  god  honey  i am so sorry l  
  oh 
i just don t want you
to ever resent me for this 
hey  i can work out of boston
just as easy as i can work out of l a 
and i don t want you
to ever resent me  ever 
  okay  so then we re goin  
  okay 
the baby has hiccups 
  oh  yeah 
  did you feel that 
  yes 
boston 
as i watched the kids pull
out of the driveway  i got an
all too familiar pain in my gut 
the one i always got when i did
something for one of the kids
that fell under the heading of 
  i did it for their own good   
and then i thought
about baby number three   
and 25 more years
of moments like this 
and suddenly 
i was tired 
i ll be able to do it again 
i m sure i can 
all right  lf it swishes 
no problem 
father of the year 
not swishes 
just goes in  well 
  oh  it s frying 
  well  we made it to july 
the farmer s almanac said

  nina was four weeks from her due date 
  and annie was two days past hers 
  howard  howard 
franck and his crew were working
around the clock to have
the baby s room ready by d day 
life was hectic 
  especially once annie moved in 
  i better go 
bryan was called to an emergency
meeting in japan  and since
annie s doctor assured us   
that the baby was at least
another week away 
 bryan took the red eye to tokyo
and left annie in our care 
 bye 
so there i was  living with
two extremely pregnant women   
  during the worst heat wave
of the century 
  okay  okay 
annie and nina dealt with
the heat by adding extra
air conditioners to the house 
turning our home into
the only igloo in san marino
