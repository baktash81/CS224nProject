mr elster suspecting well wifes mental state
took preliminary precaution watched mr ferguson
lest harm befall
youve heard mr elster prepared
take wife institution
mental health wouldve hands qualified specialists
mr ferguson exdetective would seemed
proper choice role watchdog protector
learned unfortunate choice
however think youll agree blame attached husband
delay putting wife medical care
due need information behavior
expected get mr ferguson
taken every precaution protect wife
could anticipated mr fergusons weakness
fear heights
would make powerless needed
mr ferguson
heard former superior
detective captain hansen great city north
testify character ability
captain hansen enthusiastic
fact similar circumstances
mr ferguson allowed police colleague fall death
captain hansen dismissed unfortunate incident
course mr ferguson congratulated
saved womans life
previous fit aberration threw bay
pity knowing suicidal tendencies
make greater effort second time
pass judgment mr fergusons lack initiative
nothing
law little say subject things left undone
strange behavior saw body fall
bearing verdict
remain scene death left
claims suffered mental blackout knew nothing
found back apartment san francisco hours later
may accept
may believe allowed someone die
could face tragic result weakness
ran away
nothing verdict
matter conscience
evidence state mind madeleine elster prior death
manner death postmortem examination body
showing actual cause death
difficulty reaching verdict
gentlemen may retire wish
hold mr jones
weve reached verdict thank
jury finds madeleine elster committed suicide
unsound mind
