for 50 years  we ve told them what
to eat  what to drink  what to wear 
for christ s sake  ben 
don t you understand 
americans love television

shows  they love wrestling 
they love sports and violence 
so what do we do 
we give them what they want 
we re number one  ben 
that s all that counts 
believe me  i ve been in
the business 30 years 
well  i haven t been in show business
as long as you have  killian 
but i m a quick learner 
so  i m going to give the
audience what i think they want
