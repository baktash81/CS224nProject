beeping continues
car alarm sounding
police radio chatter

i know nothing about politics
you voted for him didnt you
adam lang of course i did
everyone voted for him
he wasnt a politician he was a craze
well there you go
look its a new ghostwriter he needs
not another goddamn politico
he was paid 10 million for these memoirs
but rumor has it
the manuscripts a crock of shit
rhineharts lending him his house
at the ocean so they can fix it
and the pressure
must have gotten to mcara
pathologist said his blood was
like three parts booze
you mean he drowned by accident
accident suicide who cares
it was the book that killed him
well thats encouraging
chuckles dryly
who is this mcara
should i have heard of him
yeah he was some kind of aide to lang
when he was prime minister
so dont admit that you havent
he was with him for years
sighing
i dont know rick
this is a great opportunity for you
plus the money is good kids wont starve
i dont have any kids

thats enough to make us a target
apparently
thank you
how many have you seen
five youre the last
card reader beeps
i must be honest

its not your decision roy
john maddox chief executive
of rhinehart new york
sir
sidney kroll
mr langs washington attorney
mr kroll
and nick ricardelli i believe you know
all right rick
john all right i gather from rick
youre aware of the situation
perhaps you can enlighten us
and tell us what exactly
youre gonna bring to this project
nothing
laughing
no im not gonna pretend
to be someone im not
you have my cv
his last effort was
the autobiography of a magician
i came i sawed i conquered
yeah and it went straight
to number one so
after you turned it down roy
look i dont read political memoirs
who does
and i gather youve spent
10 million on this book
how much of that are you gonna see back
two three
its bad news for your shareholders
and its worse news
for your client mr kroll
adam lang he wants a place in history
not in the remainder tables
oh please
its because i know nothing about politics
that ill ask the questions that get
right to the heart of who adam lang is
and that is what sells autobiographies
heart
wow thats nicely done
what utter balls
you think so
john of course
adam langs a world historical figure
his autobiography is gonna be
a worldpublishing event
yeah well i got warehouses filled with
worldpublishing events
waiting to be pulped
sid
adam is obviously still very upset
by what happened to mike mcara
he was irreplaceable
irreplaceable and yet he has to be replaced
adam can certainly appreciate the benefits
of trying someone different
in the end its about chemistry
do you work out maybe
not really
thats a pity adam likes to work out
actually i know a good writer
on the guardian who uses a gym
rick scoffs
okay maybe we could just run over
the publishing schedule yeah
we need to wrap this up in a month
ghost a month
yes
you want the book in a month

imitates british accent

adam is locked into a us lecture tour
also a fundraising program
for the adam lang foundation
its a month in the states thats okay
couldnt i bring the manuscript back here
to work on
im afraid not its in a secure environment
in marty rhineharts own house
only a few people are allowed to handle it
sounds more like a bomb than a book
chuckles
i will need to see it myself at some point

meanwhile former british prime minister
adam lang is back in the news tonight

the illegal use of british special forces
to seize four suspected alqaeda terrorists
in pakistan
and then hand them over
for interrogation by the cia
the men nasir ashraf marwat sayed
salim khan and faruk ahmed
all british citizens were seized in the
pakistani city of peshawar five years ago
all four were allegedly transferred
out of the country
to a secret location and tortured
mr ashraf is reported to have died
under interrogation

langs are scottish folk
originally and proud of it
our name is a derivation of long
the old english word for tall
and it is from north of the border
that my forefathers hail
fuck
my greatgrandfather ebenezer lang
was born in 1862 in pitlochry scotland
one of nine children seven of them boys
the american president
was much taller than i had expected
laughing
this years european summit
was particularly interesting
i always found the queen in private
to have a delightful sense of humor
thanks
reading indistinctly
ive always been an optimist
the present is where we live
ruth and i look forward to the future
whatever it may hold
as bad as that
oh hello
well how bad is it
you havent read it
not all of it
well lets just say it needs some work
how much work
well all the words are there
theyre just in the wrong order
come on you look like you need a break
you were my idea
i was
you wrote christy costellos memoirs
didnt you
you read those
we stayed at his house in mustique
last winter
the book was beside the bed
im embarrassed
no why
it was brilliant in a horrible sort of way
how you turned his ramblings
into something vaguely coherent
i said to adam heres the guy
to write your book not mike
sighs god i miss home
its like being married
to napoleon on st helena
why dont you go back to london
ruth i dont feel i can leave him alone
theres something not quite right
with him at the moment
amelia told me he was very upset
at the death of michael mcara
oh she did did she
quite when mrs bly became the expert
on my husbands emotions im not sure
losing mike was a blow of course
but its not just that
its having to relive everything
year by year for this bloody book
oh dear
you must be wondering
what youve let yourself in for
fine fine ill tell him
theyre just about to land
on thursday hes in chicago
actually i think ill go and meet him
amelia can stay here
and polish her nails or something
why dont you come say hello
fine ill travel in the backup car
i can do my nails in there
chuckling
hi darling
how was new york
short and sweet
hi barry hi amelia
hello who are you
im your ghost
right
dont worry he isnt always such a jerk
this place really comes alive at night
youll be with us for four weeks
is that right
im afraid so
and the bill goes directly
to the rhinehart corporation
good
that doesnt include the minibar
snoring
all right hes ready for you
hows your hotel quiet
monastic
thats nice no distractions
thanks love
hi man you ready to start
absolutely
electronic beeping
ghost is the manuscript loaded on this
it is
can i have it
amelia im sorry
that would be a security risk
you mean ive got to retype
the whole manuscript
have you really got my entire book
on that little thing
we can get 100 books on it adam
and it can be copied in a flash
thats the trouble
amazing
you know the worst thing about my life
you get so out of touch
everythings done for you
you dont drive you dont carry money
if i need cash
i have to borrow it from the protection boys
this is the kind of details
we need in the memoirs
i couldnt put that in
people would think i was a complete idiot
no not at all no this shows what its like
being prime minister
thats exactly
what the readers want to know
how does it feel to run a country
how does it feel to be so cut off
how does it feel to be so hated
thanks a lot
stammers and so loved
amelia what do you think
i think i should leave you two alone
door closes
so how do we go about this
i interview you
i turn your answers into prose
here and there ill add linking passages
imitating your voice
okay
you heard about mike
yes im sorry
we should put in
something nice about him
i think his mother would like that
of course
well um the first thing that struck me was
you became such a successful politician
precisely because
you didnt appear to be a politician
its certainly not something i wanted to do
when i was younger
i thought most student politicians
were complete nerds
well im with you there
so what turned you on to politics
chuckles
turned me on indeed
lets see i was 23 something like that
a couple of years out of cambridge
and i remember it was a sunday afternoon
it was raining
i was still in bed
and someone starts knocking at the door
and you know
id been out the night before
and had a few drinks and what have you
so i get the pillow and i put it
over my head and it starts up again
knock knock knock knock
and i get up im swearing
i go to the door and theres this girl
shes soaking wet but she just launches
into this speech about the local elections
and thats it
im in love
and this is ruth
this is ruth
and the only way i can see her again
is to join the party and hand out leaflets
this is great
you want to use this
use it i think we should open
the whole book like this
i went into politics out of love
not love for a party or an ideology
but out of love for a woman
could you transcribe this
as quickly as possible please
of course
thanks
hows it going
pretty well he keeps calling me man
he always does that
when he cant remember someones name
there are sandwiches in the kitchen
inaudible
electronic beeping
metallic clanging
alarm wailing
grunting
oh shit
its awful
im sorry sir
i didnt realize there was anyone up there
what on earth is going on
its just a security drill sir
we have it once a week
so there you are
id rather lost track of you
im a big boy now
cant keep your eye on me all the time
dont wander around on your own
the security boys dont like it
gotcha
did you win
didnt play tennis gym
gym whats he in training for
the olympics
heres your transcript
computer chimes
cambridge lets talk about that
sorry um
cambridge
it was such a long time ago
i can hardly remember
you did a lot of acting
some
it must have been good training
for politics acting
it was a good way to meet girls
lets not put that in by the way okay
still acting must have been
very important to you
okay lets say i enjoyed it
you know you go on the stage
pretend to be somebody else
and people actually applaud you for it
good thats more like it lets put that in
no
why not
because these are the memoirs
of a prime minister
and whenever my opponents were stuck
with something to hit me with
they always said i was a bloody actor
do you know what the times of london
said the day i resigned
kindly leave the stage
so no we wont dwell if you dont mind
on my student days as an actor
we leave it exactly the way mike wrote it
would you like to take
a break for a minute
actually that would be a good idea
thank you i need to make a call
door opens
amelia what a bastard
look at this
former british foreign secretary
richard rycart
has asked the international criminal court
in the hague to investigate allegations
that the former british prime minister
adam lang

and get her back here as soon as you can
right
amelia lets go
rycart has made a statement
yes i know
he just called me
amelia its unbelievable
he wanted very much to let me know
it was nothing personal
he wanted very very much to tell me
that it was only
because of his wellknown stand
on human rights
that he couldnt keep quiet any longer
his wellknown stand on human rights
dear god
sorry to lose my temper earlier
forget it
and have you told her
adam yes just called her
amelia and how did she take it
sorry adam this is running on ap
according to sources in the hague
the prosecutors office
of the international criminal court

why werent we given some warning
of this wheres downing street
the phones are disconnected

now what freaking use is now
what are you people doing
i mean youre not telling me that
the cabinet office
didnt know this was coming
the war crimes court doesnt warn
a suspect whos under investigation
thats what adam is now a suspect
you need to call sid kroll
i think we should call london first
adam if it suits them
they will hang you out to dry
you need a lawyer call sid
adam sighs
get sid on the line
what about the media
issue a holding statement something short
this is when we need mike
ill write something
let him do it
hes supposed to be the writer
hang on a minute
adam i should sound confident
not defensive thatd be fatal
but i shouldnt be cocky
no bitterness no anger and dont say
im pleased at this opportunity
to clear my name or any balls like that
so youre not defensive
but youre not cocky
youre not angry but youre not pleased
adam thats it
then what exactly are you
laughing
told you he was funny
ive always been a passionate supporter
no scrub that
ive always been
a strong no committed supporter
of the work
of the international criminal court has he
youre the writer
the struggle against terror is too important
to be used for the purposes
of personal revenge
very good
you could be the new mike mcara
cell phone ringing
hello
john john maddox

and which is this
very funny
maddox just called he wants the book
in two weeks instead of four
christ good luck
yeah i wouldnt mind a lift back to my
hotel i could get on with some work there
youre not planning on
taking that manuscript
out of here are you

how serious this is getting dont you
you can search me if you like
that wont be necessary
all right fetch your stuff
ill get one of the boys to take you
mr lang insisted he had always been
a committed supporter
of the work
of the international criminal court
mr lang added quote
the struggle against terror
is too important
to be used for the purposes
of personal revenge
same again sir
this is being widely interpreted as
yes thanks
an attack on the former british
foreign secretary richard rycart
who has asked
could we change the channel
sure
thanks
at issue is the practice
of socalled waterboarding
an interrogation technique
considered a war
male announcer chattering

male announcer

telephone ringing
hello
amelia you need to check out
of the hotel immediately
things have changed a car is on its way
what
see you then
hello
car horn honking
dial tone sounds
truck beeping
indistinct chattering
man okay

its getting big huh
so i see
whore you with
im on my own
oh sod it here we go again
people clamoring
phone ringing
rick youve reached the office
of rick ricardelli leave a message
hi rick
now they want the book in two weeks
thanks for getting me this job
cant talk
some peace protestors are trying to kill me
youre working for a murderer
youre working for a murderer
woman liar liar liar
exhales
are you ill
no im aging
this place is shangrila in reverse
amelia i tried to call you
several times last night
you didnt answer
ghost i forgot to charge my mobile phone
really and the hotel phone
im a heavy sleeper
well you can do your heavy sleeping here
from now on
here
amelia were under siege
you cant run the media gauntlet every day
eventually theyll discover who you are
and that would be horrid for you
so this is where you put the granny
no
this is where we put mike mcara
we havent had a chance to clear it yet
the sheets have been changed though
actually i make it a rule
never to stay in a clients house
but now you can have constant access
to the manuscript
isnt that what you want
besides sid kroll
will be arriving any minute
why dont you settle in
and then come up and join us
youre practically one of us now
i am
you drafted the statement yesterday
that makes you an accomplice
door closes
so heres the score youre not being
charged youre not being arrested
none of this is gonna amount
to a hill of beans
the only thing the prosecutor is asking for
is permission to launch
a formal investigation
investigating me for what
connie
either crimes against humanity
or war crimes
well thats absurd
its not exactly genocide
under article 25
a person shall be guilty of a war crime
if that person facilitates the commission
of such a crime
or aids abets or otherwise assists
in its commission
thats rather sweeping
well if its any comfort
youre in no jeopardy
as long as you stay here among friends
are you saying
i cant leave the united states
as your attorney i strongly advise you
not to travel to any country
that recognizes the jurisdiction
of the international criminal court
well just about every country in the world
recognizes the icc
america doesnt
who else
sidney josh
iraq china north korea indonesia israel
and thats it
josh there are some parts of africa
wait
i wish to make a short statement
i wont be taking questions
this morning i was granted power
to investigate
the former british prime minister
mr adam peter bennett lang
under articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 rome
statute of the international criminal court
i shall shortly be contacting mr lang
and the british government
to ask for their full cooperation thank you
cell phone ringing
oh god
okay we need to get you to washington
adam right away
my plane is at the airport
we can get you in to see
the speaker of the house at lunchtime
and have a photoop
with the secretary of state in the afternoon
wont it look as if im panicking
no theyll both say
that the meetings were fixed weeks ago
well what the hell
are we supposed to be discussing
sidney aids poverty climate change
who cares the important thing
is to show the world its business as usual
what do you think ruth
i think its a terrible idea
youll look as though
youre americas whipping boy
running crying home to daddy
so what would you do
ruth fly to london
the government will support you
the british government
will cooperate fully with the investigation
really and what makes you think that
im not thinking it ruth im reading it
believe we can now go live
to the un in new york
where the former british foreign secretary
richard rycart
is about to make a statement
i watched the announcement in the hague
today with great shock and sadness
adam lang was
and is an old friend of mine
you cheeky bugger
i regret that hes chosen to bring this down
to a personal level
this isnt personal this is about justice
this is about making sure
every political leader knows
when they make a decision
they will be held to account
by international law
thank you
male reporter
if youre called to testify sir will you go
richard certainly ill go
of course you will you little shit
that settles it washington it is
ruth i still say itll look bad
not as bad as being led away
from heathrow in handcuffs
it would show you had some guts
well then why the hell
dont you just fly back without me
if the british government wants to hand me
over to this kangaroo court then sod them
ill go where people want me
amelia tell the boys were leaving
have one of the girls pack me a bag
youd better pack one for yourself
why dont you share a suitcase
its so much more convenient
ill see you tomorrow
im sorry to abandon you
at least this might help sales
perhaps rhineharts pr department
organized the whole thing
laughs
well tell them to stop it will you
okay people
remember happy happy faces
male reporter so just to summarize
what we know so far its now official
the special prosecutor
of the international war crimes court
is to launch an investigation
the special prosecutor announced
she was going to investigate mr lang

and seek to destroy democracy
are treated as victims

distant thundering

of the london elections
that i first got to know ruth
she had gained a first at oxford
and then done a years postgraduate
research as a fulbright scholar
ruth

in the war against terror
and im proud to stand by his side
this afternoon
adam good to see you
adam thank you
thank you very much indeed
its good to see you
dont grin
male newsreader
in iraq a suicide bomber
for gods sake
switches tv off
ruth sighs
cell phone ringing
adam
calling to find out how i think it went
let him sweat
does he always ask for your advice
yes
and always usually takes it
until lately
are you married
certainly not
gay
no
did you have a
i had a um
what girlfriend
well a bit more than that
partner
a bit less than that
i dont know
40000 years of human language
and theres no word
to describe our relationship
it was doomed
chuckles
come on lets eat
hows it going
the book
well its not to be honest
sit there
can i ask you something
of course
i find it difficult
to understand certain things
what things
well
i cant understand
why this goodlooking lad
who goes to cambridge
without the slightest interest in politics
and who spends his time acting
and chasing girls
suddenly ends up
married to me
oh no not that no not that at all
no what i dont get
is why at 22
hes suddenly a political activist
i mean where does that come from
didnt you ask him
he said he joined the party because of you
told me a great story about you
turning up at his place in the rain
i was gonna start the whole book with it
and now youre not
no i cant its not true
isnt it
well you know its not
hed been a member for two years
before he met you
how do you know that
ive got a copy
of his original party membership card
mike mcara found it in the archives
typical mike to ruin a good story
with too much research
did he find anything else
not much cambridge stuff mainly
you were more political than he was
i was certainly a change
from his cambridge girlfriends
all those jocastas and pandoras
and so his marriage to you
must have been pretty vital
your knowledge
and your contacts in the party
and i thought he married me for my body
did you ever want to be
a proper politician in your own right
of course
didnt you want to be a proper writer
ouch
im sorry ive hurt your feelings
i suppose even ghosts must have feelings
we are sensitive spirits
talking of spirits could you
let me get you a proper drink
white wine
never really seen the point of it
thats the sort of thing mike used to say
ah at last something in common
do you know the coroner reckoned
hed drunk nearly half a bottle
thats convenient
what do you mean
nothing
you think his death was suspicious
dont you
yes
yes i do
today at the beach
i met a man an old timer
who was familiar with the currents
and he said that there was no way
that a body from the ferry
could have washed ashore on that spot
youre kidding
he also said that there was a woman who
saw flashlights on the beach that night
and then she fell down the stairs
and now shes in a coma thats all i know
thats all you know jesus
can i borrow your phone
why
i need to call adam
what
nothing
arent you gonna call him
later im going out for a walk
but its pitch black its pouring with rain
itll clear my head
well ill come with you
no thanks but i need to work this one
through on my own
stay here have another drink
dont wait up
door opening
are you awake
well i am now
im sorry
its all right hang on
what time is it
i dont know
i called adam
and
can i come in
the day before mike died
he and adam had a terrible row
ive never told anyone this before
not even the police
what about
i dont know
but it was furious they never spoke again
distant thundering
when i asked adam about it
he refused to discuss it
after what you just said
i felt i should ask him again
and what did he say
he was having dinner
with the vice president
that bloody bly woman
wouldnt even give him the phone
sobbing
oh god oh dear god
whats he got himself mixed up in
its all right everythingll be all right
im scared
ive never been scared in my life before
but i am now
crying
your hairs all wet youre drenched
let me get you a towel
softly bad idea
do you mind
course not
the modesty of the morning after
im sorry i thought you were asleep
you mean you thought id be gone
youve taken out the family tree
hes very proud of the langs
you know if you want a family tree
go to a garden center
why have you underlined my name
every time
i was surprised
there wasnt more about you
why im just the wife
yeah even so
you ought not to be written out of history
why not most women are
then ill reinstate you
ill put in all the occasions
that hes forgotten
how kind like the bosss secretary
that remembers his wifes birthday for him
something like that but then
like you say im not a proper writer
what are you planning to do
leave
its not necessary as far as im concerned
im afraid it is as far as i am
where will you go
back to the hotel
look im sorry i should never have stayed
in a clients house
it always ends up with
with you screwing the clients wife
no not always
but it does make it hard
to maintain a professional distance
and the thing we discussed last night
what do you propose to do about that
thats none of my business
well you cant just ignore it
look im his ghostwriter
im not an investigative reporter
what are you gonna do about it
perhaps ill write my own memoirs
exprime ministers wife tells aii
well if you ever decide to do that
give me a call
you think i need someone like you
to produce my book
i dont want to be in his bloody memoirs
hes on his own ill get a divorce
and she can do the prison visits

nancy hello
is that mrs emmett
who is this
i wondered if i might have a word
with professor emmett
do you have an appointment
its about adam lang
im assisting him with his memoirs
just a moment please
paul this is paul emmett
i think you must have made a mistake
but you were at cambridge with mr lang
we were contemporaries yes
but i cant claim to know him
i have a photograph of you together
come on up to the house
i make it a rule never to see anyone
without an appointment
but your mention of a photograph
rather tickled my curiosity
please come in
thank you
yes hes here now
may i
sure
nancy yes yes hes on his own
he didnt say
british about 40
well well
i literally have no recollection of this
but that is you
yes it is
i was on the board of the dramat
i had quite a time of it as you can imagine
the dramat
im sorry the yale dramatic association
i maintained my theatrical interests
when i went to cambridge
for my doctoral research
could i keep this
no im afraid not
im sure i could get you a copy
would you that would be kind
maybe you could tell me
how you came by it
id be happy to
come into my study
yes the wall of ego
we all have one
its our equivalent of the dentists fish tank
chuckling
have a seat
so the picture
um
ive been working with adam lang
on his memoirs
yes i know you told me
yes poor lang its bad business
this posturing by the hague
as for rycart the worst
british foreign secretary since the war
lang was right to fire him
how well do you know lang
hardly at all
you seem surprised
he mentions you in his memoirs
oh really
well now its my turn to be surprised
what does he say
clearing throat
reading indistinctly
thats very decent of him
as prime minister
he always had good instincts
but that doesnt mean i know him
but the
that that was taken at a reception
in london
to mark the 10year anniversary
of the arcadia
arcadia
yeah its a little organization that i ran
very highbrow
no reason why you should have heard of it
the prime minister graced us
with his presence
what can you remember of him
from cambridge
im sorry you dont mind do you
no not at all go ahead
its just that im rather bewildered
no ones mentioned the cambridge
connection between us in all these years
but you performed together
in one production
it was the summer revue
i cant even remember what it was called
can i show you something else
if you must
clearing throat
oh my
chuckling
is that what i think it is
lets hope he didnt inhale
but that is you standing behind him
isnt it
i do believe it is
and i do believe im on the point
of issuing a stern warning to him
on the perils of drug abuse
is mr lang really going to use
these pictures in his memoirs
if so i would prefer it if i werent named
my children would be mortified
theyre so much more puritanical
than we were
can you tell me about any of the others
no im afraid not
the whole summer is a blur
a very happy blur
now you were going to tell me
about these pictures
i got them from michael mcara
and he is whom exactly
my predecessor on langs memoirs
he resigned
no he died
im sorry to hear that
yes a couple of weeks ago
he drove up here to see you
and he died a few hours afterwards
he drove up to see me
no im afraid youre mistaken
how did he die
he drowned
poor fellow
ive never really believed the myth that
death by drowning is painless have you
seems to me it must be agonizing
and the police never said anything to you
about this
ive had no contact with the police
but were you here that weekend
this would have been
january the 11th and 12th
chuckles
a less equable man than i might start
to find your questions impertinent
nancy
nancy
our visitor wishes to know where we were
on the 11th and 12th of january
do we possess that information
that was the colorado weekend
yes of course the aspen institute
bipolar relationships in a multipolar world
sounds fun
yes it was i was the main speaker
look just to return to cambridge
no if you dont mind
lets not return to cambridge
ive said all i have to say on that subject
im an avid reader of political memoirs
ill get hold of mr langs when they appear
perhaps hell send you a copy
for old times sake
i doubt that very much
the gate will open automatically
be sure to make a right
when you get to the end of the drive
if you turn left the road
will take you deeper into the woods
and you may never be seen again

cell phone ringing
hello
ruth youre alive

ive been worried sick
the police called to say
theyd found the car on the ferry again
im so sorry i parked it
and then and then i got off the boat
what the hell were you doing
on the mainland anyway
i drove to new york
why
i needed to see john maddox
and where are you now
im still at the ferry terminal
i missed the last crossing
you really are bloody hopeless
i just had adam on the phone
trying to get hold of you
hes flying back tonight
he sounds in a right state
you didnt tell him about us did you
gods sake ruth
knocking on door
ive got to go ill call you back
who is it
mr rycart sent me
hold on
just gonna do a quick check
if you dont mind
get your stuff together were leaving
hey thats private
hes clean
richard thanks frank
sorry about that please get in
you thought it was a trap
it crossed my mind
you do work for lang
yeah for three days i hardly know the guy
who does i worked for him for 15 years
till he fired me and i still cant fathom him
yeah his wife said more or less the same
there you go if someone as sharp as ruth
cant get him what hope do we have
tough day
yeah you could say that
you have the book
frank yeah
hes got it
before we go any further i wonder
if i might take a look at that book
no before we go any further
theres a few things id like to know first
such as
why did mike mcara have your number
okay sure
he was helping me
mcara how
mike found the documents linking lang
to the torture flights
what it was mcara
who gave you the documents
yeah mike mcara the loyalest of the loyal
but why
he didnt like discovering
he was working for a war criminal
would you
oh i forgot you are
the book
well dont tell me
youre gonna read it now
not all of it just the beginning
theres something very important about it
yeah its the cure for insomnia
there you go guys
can i get you anything else
no thanks love
mike said hed discovered something new
its the last time he called me
he said it explained everything that had
gone wrong when we were in government
what was it
he wouldnt say over the phone
he just kept saying if anything happened
to him the truth was in langs memoirs
its all there in the beginning
the beginning
then he means cambridge
what the hells this
that is lang and that is paul emmett
emmett the arcadia guy so what
on the day that mike mcara died
he drove up to see emmett
and i think he was murdered
on his way home
what
i went to see emmett today
and two guys followed me from his house
thats why i called you
at the time that this photograph was taken
paul emmett was an officer in the cia
emmett
foreign resources division
oh my god
you realize how important this is
dont you
this explains why lang went into politics
everyone knows he didnt have
a political thought in his pretty little head
this is why he rose so quickly
with a little help from his friends
well do you think its possible
okay a quiz for you
name one decision lang made in 10 years
as prime minister
which wasnt in the interests of the usa
well come on its not a trick question
iraq middle east policy star wars defense
buying american nuclear missiles
support of terrorist rendition
the sacking of any minister
washington didnt like
including yours truly
mcara was right
this explains everything
cell phone ringing
its amelia bly
answer it
hello amelia
good evening i have adam for you
softly lang
adam were coming to get you
what
ruth tells me
youre stuck at the ferry terminal
weve just taken off from new york
pilot says we can stop by and pick you up
really theres no need
weve got a book to write remember
hold on a sec adam
softly he said he wants to
pick me up in his private jet
say yes
what if its a trap
if you refuse hell get suspicious
tell him yes
thatd be great adam yeah thanks
ill get to the airport
see you there
he sounds worried
i really dont think this is a good idea
you have no choice
emmett must have told lang
that id been to see him
so whats he gonna do about it
dump you in the ocean
well it happened before
which means it cant happen again
he cant drown two ghostwriters
for gods sake youre not kittens
all this is just theory
we dont have any proof
youll get us the proof
me
youre his ghostwriter
presumably he lets you tape him
i use discs actually
discs tapes
youve got to confront him with this
record his reaction
even if he denies it its something
im in a tricky position here
i signed a confidentiality agreement
its a bit late for that
it means the discs are his property
the court can subpoena them
and what if i dont record any discs
then youll be subpoenaed
and forced to repeat this whole story
then ill deny it
then ill give them this
frank is recording every word
arent you frank
oh come on
dont look so shocked
what did you expect
that id come into a meeting
with a man working for lang
without taking any precautions
except youre not working
for lang anymore
youre working for the good guys
you know all this is pointless dont you
in the end hell just retire over here
with his cia pension
and hell tell you and the bloody
war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves
good evening sir
hatherton welcomes you aboard
thank you
its my first time in a private jet
well lets hope its not your last
hi man
take your seat
thanks
hey bring my ghost a calvados
yes sir
do you mind
leave it off for now
ruth said you were in new york
to see maddox
thats right
how was he
he was fine
full of energy
you know john
yes i do know john
as a matter of fact i was just with him
you never saw him today did you
no
do you have something to tell me
i went to see emmett
laughing that windbag why
i know about you and emmett
me and emmett
i know that he was your
my
handler if thats what theyre called
my handler
yeah that he was your handler in the cia
coughing
laughing
oh my god
youre serious arent you
when mcara found this
he went to boston to show it to emmett
and he died on the way home
and i think he was murdered
i think youve had a few too many
of those already
it was mcara who believed that emmett told
you to go into politics in the first place
emmett i barely knew the man
and that story of yours
about why you joined the party and ruth
and the canvassing well the dates dont fit
i got the dates wrong big deal
then when he found this photograph
and he heard the rumors
about emmett being in the cia
rumors
its on the internet
ive never heard such utter balls
in my entire life
mike would never have believed such crap
he was too clever too loyal
mike betrayed you to rycart
how do you know that
he told me
rycart
hes lying
this phone number on the back
of the photograph its rycarts
the handwriting thats mcaras
mike
mike mike
and you knew he was disillusioned
you had a big row with him
just before he died
yes i know but he never mentioned this
this is just this is grotesque
ive never taken orders from anyone
whatever i did
i did because i believed it was right
what even supporting illegal kidnapping
for torture
oh for gods sake
spare me the bleedingheart bullshit
do you know what id do
if i was in power again
id have two queues at airports
one for flights
where wed done no background checks
infringed on no ones civil bloody liberties
used no intelligence gained by torture
and on the other flight
wed do everything we possibly could
to make it perfectly safe
and then wed see which plane
the rycarts of this world
would put their bloody kids on
shouting
and you can put that in the book
protesters clamoring
man go home
woman go home
man here comes the killer
woman prosecute for torture
female reporter over here mr lang

how long had you known mr lang
couple of days
in what capacity
i was his ghost
his ghostwriter
do you recognize this man
he was one of the protestors
his son was killed in iraq
did you ever speak with him
he was in the bar one night
in the hotel where i was staying
fbi agent 2 but did you speak with him
he asked me if i knew where adam lang
was staying on the island
i told him that i didnt
did you report this conversation
sorry
did you report this conversation
to mr langs protection team
no
what was mr langs demeanor
this evening
he was he was fine he seemed fine
one witness said she thought
she heard mr lang shouting at you
no
were gonna need your passport
why
a serious crime was just committed
in us territory and youre the key witness
we need to keep you close
male reporter like a fallen soldier
adam lang went home today
home to a shocked and grieving nation
not just his family but friends
and political opponents joined in tribute
a great colleague and a true patriot
we had our disagreements
but we always stayed friends
my heart goes out to ruth and the family
knocking on door
and i would like to say adam will be
switches tv off
knocking continues
who is it
rick congratulations

i just want to go home
you can

sobbing
im sorry
i think im over it

to bring your husband
that didnt work out
i hadnt appreciated quite how bored
he was with being my plus one

yeah
indistinct chattering
amelia bly plus one
thank you
people laughing
that was a bit of a turnup for the books
you calling me
i heard you werent invited
and i thought you should be here
ghosts are never invited
to the launch party as a rule
were an embarrassment
like a mistress at a wedding
sorry
i brought you a present
thank you
chuckles thats very funny
i thought seeing as
you were so keen to hold onto it
you might like it as a souvenir
between you and me it wasnt us
it was the americans
they thought the book was
a potential threat to national security
but theres nothing in it
something about the beginnings
i think thats what i heard
the beginning
no beginnings the beginnings
beginnings
you all right
do you know that man
the one whos speaking to ruth
paul emmett
whats he doing here
well he was ruths tutor at harvard
when she was a fulbright scholar

guests clapping
i miss adam all the time
but never more than tonight

langs
wife ruth
was recruited
as a cia agent
by professor paul emmett
of harvard university
ruth well youll be relieved to hear

i just want to thank
our wonderful publishers
marty rhinehart and john maddox
and our attorney and friend sidney kroll
and finally but especially mike mcara
mike our thoughts are with you
in these very difficult few months
ive drawn great comfort from this book
from knowing that despite the terrible
double tragedy of losing both of them
mike and adam did at least live long
enough to complete it
and i really believe that
as people read these pages
adams voice will keep on coming through
for generations to come
eloquent strong and full of hope
thanks to his words he is with us still
if ive left out anyones name
i hope youll forgive me
but now i must make a toast
to the memory of a great man
and a great patriot
a wonderful husband and a devoted father
to adam

all clapping
you were marvelous
