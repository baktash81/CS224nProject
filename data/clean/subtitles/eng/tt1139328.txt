 beeping continues 
 car alarm sounding 
 police radio chatter 
but you realize
i know nothing about politics 
  you voted for him  didn t you 
  adam lang  of course i did 
everyone voted for him 
he wasn t a politician  he was a craze 
well  there you go 
look  it s a new ghostwriter he needs 
not another goddamn politico 
he was paid  10 million for these memoirs 
but rumor has it
the manuscript s a crock of shit 
rhinehart s lending him his house
at the ocean so they can fix it 
and the pressure
must have gotten to mcara 
pathologist said his blood was 
like  three parts booze 
you mean he drowned by accident 
accident  suicide  who cares 
it was the book that killed him 
well  that s encouraging 
 chuckles dryly 
who is this mcara 
should i have heard of him 
yeah  he was some kind of aide to lang
when he was prime minister 
so don t admit that you haven t 
he was with him for years 
 sighing 
i don t know  rick 
this is a great opportunity for you 
plus the money is good  kids won t starve 
  i don t have any kids 
  i do 
roy 
 beeping 
who re you expecting to bomb you 
random house 
we re publishing lang s memoirs 
that s enough to make us a target 
apparently 
thank you 
  how many have you seen 
  five  you re the last 
 card reader beeps 
i must be honest 
i don t think you re the right man
for this assignment 
then it s a good job
it s not your decision  roy 
john maddox  chief executive
of rhinehart  new york 
sir 
sidney kroll 
mr  lang s washington attorney 
mr  kroll 
and nick ricardelli i believe you know 
all right  rick 
john  all right  i gather from rick
you re aware of the situation 
perhaps you can enlighten us
and tell us what exactly
you re gonna bring to this project 
nothing 
 laughing 
no  i m not gonna pretend
to be someone i m not 
you have my cv 
his last effort was
the autobiography of a magician 
i came  i sawed  i conquered 
yeah  and it went straight
to number one  so   
after you turned it down  roy 
look  i don t read political memoirs 
who does 
and i gather you ve spent
 10 million on this book 
how much of that are you gonna see back 
two  three 
it s bad news for your shareholders 
and it s worse news
for your client  mr  kroll 
adam lang  he wants a place in history 
not in the remainder tables 
oh  please 
it s because i know nothing about politics
that i ll ask the questions that get
right to the heart of who adam lang is 
and that is what sells autobiographies 
heart 
wow  that s nicely done 
  what utter balls 
  you think so 
john  of course 
adam lang s a world historical figure 
his autobiography is gonna be
a world publishing event 
yeah  well  i got warehouses filled with
world publishing events
waiting to be pulped 
sid 
adam is obviously still very upset
by what happened to mike mcara 
he was irreplaceable 
irreplaceable  and yet he has to be replaced 
adam can certainly appreciate the benefits
of trying someone different 
in the end  it s about chemistry 
do you work out  maybe 
  not really 
  that s a pity  adam likes to work out 
actually  i know a good writer
on the guardian who uses a gym 
 rick scoffs 
okay  maybe we could just run over
the publishing schedule  yeah 
we need to wrap this up in a month 
  ghost  a month 
  yes 
  you want the book in a month 
  we already have a first draft 
yeah  well  it needs a lot of work 
that s why i like your résumé here 
you re fast  and you deliver 
you name it  he ghosts it   chuckles 
and you re a brit 
the ghost should be a brit 
 imitates british accent 
to get the jolly old tone right  right 
 chuckling 
  do you have any family commitments 
  no  i have no family  why 
adam is locked into a us lecture tour 
also a fundraising program
for the adam lang foundation 
it s a month in the states  that s okay 
couldn t i bring the manuscript back here
to work on 
i m afraid not  it s in a secure environment
in marty rhinehart s own house 
only a few people are allowed to handle it 
sounds more like a bomb than a book 
 chuckles 
i will need to see it myself at some point 
i am supposed to be editing it 
yeah  in theory 
actually  we need to talk about that 
  john  how soon can you get over there 
  as soon as you want 
  he ll fly tonight 
  rick 
 softly  it s okay 
okay  you re in 
oh 
   grunts  congratulations 
  thank you  thanks 
  rick 
  thank you 
actually  i have something here
  you might want to look at 
  is that    is that   
no  no  no  this isn t adam s book 
no  it s another client of mine 
yeah  perhaps you can let me know
what you think

always nice to see you  roy 
roy  good luck 
oh  god

 cell phone ringing

have followed me from rhinehart s 
why would they do that 
well  maybe they thought
i had lang s book 
i knew this whole thing was a bad idea 
you re still okay to fly tonight  right 
for god s sake  rick  i m in shock 
well  here s another shock for you 
for one month s work
on a manuscript that s already written 
rhinehart inc  is willing
to pay you  250 000  plus expenses 
window seat or aisle 
female newsreader  islam has
issued a statement claiming responsibility 
we hope to bring you more on that
later in the bulletin 
meanwhile  former british prime minister
adam lang is back in the news tonight 
according to leaked documents 
mr  lang authorized
the illegal use of british special forces
to seize four suspected al qaeda terrorists
in pakistan
and then hand them over
for interrogation by the cia 
the men  nasir ashraf  marwat sayed 
salim khan and faruk ahmed 
all british citizens  were seized in the
pakistani city of peshawar five years ago 
all four were allegedly transferred
out of the country
to a secret location and tortured 
mr  ashraf is reported to have died
under interrogation 
 phone ringing 
such an operation
would have been illegal under   
  rick  yeah

 langs are scottish folk 
originally  and proud of it 
 our name is a derivation of  long  
the old english word for  tall  
 and it is from north of the border
that my forefathers hail  
fuck 
 my great grandfather  ebenezer lang 
 was born in 1862 in pitlochry  scotland 
 one of nine children  seven of them boys  
 the american president
was much taller than i had expected  
 laughing 
 this year s european summit
was particularly interesting  
 i always found the queen  in private 
to have a delightful sense of humor  
thanks 
 reading indistinctly 
 i ve always been an optimist 
the present is where we live 
 ruth and i look forward to the future 
whatever it may hold  
as bad as that 
oh  hello 
well  how bad is it 
you haven t read it 
not all of it 
  well  let s just say it needs some work 
  how much work 
well  all the words are there 
they re just in the wrong order 
come on  you look like you need a break 
you were my idea 
i was 
you wrote christy costello s memoirs 
didn t you 
you read those 
we stayed at his house in mustique 
last winter 
the book was beside the bed 
  i m embarrassed 
  no  why 
it was brilliant  in a horrible sort of way 
how you turned his ramblings
into something vaguely coherent 
i said to adam   here s the guy
to write your book  not mike  
 sighs  god  i miss home 
it s like being married
to napoleon on st  helena 
  why don t you go back to london 
  ruth  i don t feel i can leave him alone 
there s something not quite right
with him at the moment 
amelia told me he was very upset
at the death of michael mcara 
oh  she did  did she 
quite when mrs  bly became the expert
on my husband s emotions  i m not sure 
losing mike was a blow  of course 
but it s not just that 
it s having to relive everything 
year by year  for this bloody book 
oh  dear 
you must be wondering
what you ve let yourself in for 
fine  fine  i ll tell him 
they re just about to land 
on thursday  he s in chicago 
actually  i think i ll go and meet him 
amelia can stay here
and polish her nails or something 
why don t you come  say hello 
fine  i ll travel in the backup car 
i can do my nails in there 
 chuckling 
hi  darling 
  how was new york 
  short and sweet 
hi  barry  hi  amelia 
hello  who are you 
i m your ghost 
right 
don t worry  he isn t always such a jerk 
this place really comes alive at night 
you ll be with us for four weeks 
is that right 
i m afraid so 
and the bill goes directly
to the rhinehart corporation 
good 
that doesn t include the mini bar 
 snoring 
all right  he s ready for you 
how s your hotel  quiet 
monastic 
that s nice  no distractions 
thanks  love 
hi  man  you ready to start 
absolutely 
 electronic beeping 
  ghost  is the manuscript loaded on this 
  it is 
can i have it 
amelia  i m sorry 
that would be a security risk 
you mean i ve got to retype
the whole manuscript 
have you really got my entire book
on that little thing 
we can get 100 books on it  adam 
and it can be copied in a flash 
that s the trouble 
amazing 
you know the worst thing about my life 
you get so out of touch 
everything s done for you 
you don t drive  you don t carry money 
if i need cash 
i have to borrow it from the protection boys 
this is the kind of details
we need in the memoirs 
i couldn t put that in 
people would think i was a complete idiot 
no  not at all  no  this shows what it s like
being prime minister 
that s exactly
what the readers want to know 
how does it feel to run a country 
how does it feel to be so cut off 
how does it feel to be so hated 
thanks a lot 
 stammers  and so loved 
amelia  what do you think 
i think i should leave you two alone 
 door closes 
so  how do we go about this 
i interview you 
i turn your answers into prose 
here and there  i ll add linking passages 
imitating your voice 
okay 
  you heard about mike 
  yes  i m sorry 
we should put in
something nice about him 
i think his mother would like that 
of course 
well  um  the first thing that struck me was 
you became such a successful politician
precisely because
you didn t appear to be a politician 
it s certainly not something i wanted to do
when i was younger 
i thought most student politicians
were complete nerds 
well  i m with you there 
so  what turned you on to politics 
 chuckles 
turned me on  indeed 
let s see  i was 23  something like that 
a couple of years out of cambridge 
and i remember it was a sunday afternoon 
it was raining 
i was still in bed 
and someone starts knocking at the door 
and  you know 
i d been out the night before
and had a few drinks and what have you 
so  i get the pillow and i put it
over my head  and it starts up again 
knock  knock  knock  knock 
and i get up  i m swearing 
i go to the door and there s this girl 
she s soaking wet  but she just launches
into this speech about the local elections 
and that s it 
  i m in love 
  and this is ruth 
this is ruth 
and the only way i can see her again
is to join the party and hand out leaflets 
this is great 
you want to use this 
use it  i think we should open
the whole book like this 
 i went into politics out of love 
 not love for a party or an ideology 
but out of love for a woman  
could you transcribe this
as quickly as possible  please 
of course 
  thanks 
  how s it going 
pretty well  he keeps calling me  man  
he always does that
when he can t remember someone s name 
there are sandwiches in the kitchen 
 inaudible 
 electronic beeping 
 metallic clanging 
 alarm wailing 
 grunting 
oh  shit 
it s awful 
i m sorry  sir 
i didn t realize there was anyone up there 
what on earth is going on 
it s just a security drill  sir 
we have it once a week 
so  there you are 
i d rather lost track of you 
i m a big boy now 
can t keep your eye on me all the time 
don t wander around on your own 
the security boys don t like it 
gotcha 
  did you win 
  didn t play tennis  gym 
gym  what s he in training for 
the olympics 
here s your transcript 
 computer chimes 
cambridge  let s talk about that 
sorry  um   
cambridge 
it was such a long time ago 
i can hardly remember 
you did a lot of acting 
some 
it must have been good training
for politics  acting 
it was a good way to meet girls 
let s not put that in  by the way  okay 
still  acting must have been
very important to you 
okay  let s say i enjoyed it 
you know  you go on the stage 
pretend to be somebody else 
and people actually applaud you for it 
good  that s more like it  let s put that in 
  no 
  why not 
because these are the memoirs
of a prime minister 
and whenever my opponents were stuck
with something to hit me with 
they always said i was a bloody actor 
do you know what the times of london
said the day i resigned 
 kindly leave the stage  
so  no  we won t dwell  if you don t mind 
on my student days as an actor 
we leave it exactly the way mike wrote it 
would you like to take
a break for a minute 
actually  that would be a good idea 
thank you  i need to make a call 
 door opens 
amelia  what a bastard 
look at this 
 former british foreign secretary
richard rycart
 has asked the international criminal court
in the hague to investigate allegations
 that the former british prime minister
adam lang
 ordered the illegal handover
of terrorist suspects
 for torture by the cia  
 phone ringing 
don t 
 cell phone ringing 
the pack is on the move 
unplug all the phones 
is ruth still out walking 
shit  she is  isn t she 
  barry  barry 
  yeah 
would you please find mrs  lang
and get her back here as soon as you can 
  right 
  amelia  let s go 
  rycart has made a statement 
  yes  i know 
  he just called me 
  amelia  it s unbelievable 
he wanted very much to let me know
it was nothing personal 
he wanted very  very much to tell me
that it was only
because of his well known stand
on human rights
that he couldn t keep quiet any longer 
 his well known stand on human rights  
dear god 
  sorry to lose my temper earlier 
  forget it 
and have you told her 
adam  yes  just called her 
amelia  and how did she take it 
sorry  adam  this is running on ap 
 according to sources in the hague 
 the prosecutor s office
of the international criminal court
 will issue a statement in the morning  
amelia  oh  adam 
thank you  alice 
why weren t we given some warning
of this  where s downing street 
the phones are disconnected 
switch is probably
trying to get through now 
now  what freaking use is now 
what are you people doing 
i mean  you re not telling me that
the cabinet office
didn t know this was coming 
the war crimes court doesn t warn
a suspect who s under investigation 
that s what adam is now  a suspect 
you need to call sid kroll 
i think we should call london first 
adam  if it suits them 
they will hang you out to dry 
  you need a lawyer  call sid 
   adam sighs 
  get sid on the line 
  what about the media 
issue a holding statement  something short 
this is when we need mike 
i ll write something 
let him do it 
he s supposed to be the writer 
  hang on a minute 
  adam  i should sound confident 
not defensive  that d be fatal 
but i shouldn t be cocky 
no bitterness  no anger  and don t say
i m pleased at this opportunity
to clear my name or any balls like that 
so  you re not defensive 
but you re not cocky 
you re not angry  but you re not pleased 
  adam  that s it 
  then what exactly are you 
 laughing 
told you he was funny 
i ve always been a passionate supporter   
no  scrub that 
i ve always been
a strong  no  committed supporter
of the work
of the international criminal court  has he 
you re the writer 
the struggle against terror is too important
to be used for the purposes
of personal revenge 
very good 
you could be the new mike mcara 
 cell phone ringing 
  hello 
  john  john maddox 
this is gonna be big 
this can only be good for us 
  could be 
  here s the first chapter right here 
okay 
what ve you covered so far 
um   
the early years  childhood  university 
all right  forget that crap 
get him focused on the war crimes 
and he can t talk to anybody else  all right 
  right 
  it s gotta be our exclusive 
any chance of you
finishing the manuscript sooner 
sooner 
yeah  yeah  sooner 
well  how much sooner 
i m thinking two weeks 
jesus 
look  i know it s tough 
but if anyone can do it  you can 
i m relying on you  we ll talk 
 disconnects 
shit 
i d never have guessed you smoked 
i only allow myself one
at times of great stress or contentment 
  and which is this 
  very funny 
maddox just called  he wants the book
in two weeks instead of four 
christ  good luck 
yeah  i wouldn t mind a lift back to my
hotel  i could get on with some work there 
you re not planning on
taking that manuscript
  out of here  are you 
  course not 
because you do realize
how serious this is getting  don t you 
  you can search me  if you like 
  that won t be necessary 
all right  fetch your stuff 
i ll get one of the boys to take you 
mr  lang insisted he had always been
a committed supporter
of the work
of the international criminal court 
mr  lang added  quote 
 the struggle against terror
is too important
 to be used for the purposes
of personal revenge  
  same again  sir 
  this is being widely interpreted as   
  yes  thanks 
   an attack on the former british
foreign secretary richard rycart 
who has asked   
could we change the channel 
  sure 
  thanks 
at issue is the practice
of so called waterboarding 
an interrogation technique
considered a war   
 male announcer chattering

 telephone ringing 
  hello 
  amelia  you need to check out
of the hotel immediately 
things have changed  a car is on its way 
what

hello 
 car horn honking 
 dial tone sounds 
 truck beeping 
 indistinct chattering 
  man  okay 
  just check on that  okay 
  it s getting big  huh 
  so i see 
who re you with 
i m on my own 
oh  sod it  here we go again 
 people clamoring 
 phone ringing 
rick  you ve reached the office
of rick ricardelli  leave a message 
hi  rick 
now they want the book in two weeks 
thanks for getting me this job 
can t talk 
some peace protestors are trying to kill me 
you re working for a murderer 
you re working for a murderer 
woman  liar  liar  liar 
 exhales 
  are you ill 
  no  i m aging 
this place is shangri la in reverse 
amelia  i tried to call you
several times last night 
you didn t answer 
ghost  i forgot to charge my mobile phone 
really  and the hotel phone 
i m a heavy sleeper 
well  you can do your heavy sleeping here
from now on 
  here 
  amelia  we re under siege 
you can t run the media gauntlet every day 
eventually  they ll discover who you are 
and that would be horrid for you 
so  this is where you put the granny 
no 
this is where we put mike mcara 
we haven t had a chance to clear it yet 
the sheets have been changed  though 
actually  i make it a rule
never to stay in a client s house 
but now you can have constant access
to the manuscript 
isn t that what you want 
besides  sid kroll
will be arriving any minute 
why don t you settle in 
and then come up and join us 
  you re practically one of us now 
  i am 
you drafted the statement yesterday 
that makes you an accomplice 
 door closes 
so  here s the score  you re not being
charged  you re not being arrested 
none of this is gonna amount
to a hill of beans 
the only thing the prosecutor is asking for
is permission to launch
a formal investigation 
  investigating me for what 
  connie 
either crimes against humanity
or war crimes 
well  that s absurd 
it s not exactly genocide 
 under article 25 
a person shall be guilty of a war crime
 if that person facilitates the commission
of such a crime
 or aids  abets or otherwise assists
in its commission  
  that s rather sweeping 
  well  if it s any comfort 
you re in no jeopardy
as long as you stay here  among friends 
are you saying
i can t leave the united states 
as your attorney  i strongly advise you
not to travel to any country
that recognizes the jurisdiction
of the international criminal court 
well  just about every country in the world
recognizes the icc 
america doesn t 
  who else 
  sidney  josh 
iraq  china  north korea  indonesia  israel 
  and that s it 
  josh  there are some parts of africa 
wait 
i wish to make a short statement 
i won t be taking questions 
this morning  i was granted power
to investigate
the former british prime minister 
mr  adam peter bennett lang 
under articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 rome
statute of the international criminal court 
i shall shortly be contacting mr  lang
and the british government
to ask for their full cooperation  thank you 
 cell phone ringing 
oh  god 
okay  we need to get you to washington 
adam  right away 
my plane is at the airport 
we can get you in to see
the speaker of the house at lunchtime
and have a photo op
with the secretary of state in the afternoon 
won t it look as if i m panicking 
no  they ll both say
that the meetings were fixed weeks ago 
well  what the hell
are we supposed to be discussing 
sidney  aids  poverty  climate change 
who cares  the important thing
is to show the world it s business as usual 
  what do you think  ruth 
  i think it s a terrible idea 
you ll look as though
you re america s whipping boy 
running crying home to daddy 
  so  what would you do 
  ruth  fly to london 
the government will support you 
 the british government
will cooperate fully with the investigation  
really  and what makes you think that 
i m not thinking it  ruth  i m reading it 
   believe we can now go live
to the un in new york 
where the former british foreign secretary 
richard rycart 
is about to make a statement 
i watched the announcement in the hague
today with great shock and sadness 
adam lang was
and is an old friend of mine 
you cheeky bugger 
i regret that he s chosen to bring this down
to a personal level 
this isn t personal  this is about justice 
this is about making sure
every political leader knows
when they make a decision 
they will be held to account
by international law 
thank you 
male reporter 
if you re called to testify  sir  will you go 
  richard  certainly  i ll go 
  of course you will  you little shit 
that settles it  washington it is 
ruth  i still say it ll look bad 
not as bad as being led away
from heathrow in handcuffs 
it would show you had some guts 
well  then why the hell
don t you just fly back without me 
if the british government wants to hand me
over to this kangaroo court  then sod them 
i ll go where people want me 
amelia  tell the boys we re leaving 
have one of the girls pack me a bag 
you d better pack one for yourself 
why don t you share a suitcase 
it s so much more convenient 
i ll see you tomorrow 
i m sorry to abandon you 
at least this might help sales 
perhaps rhinehart s pr department
organized the whole thing 
 laughs 
well  tell them to stop it  will you 
okay  people 
remember  happy  happy faces 
male reporter  so  just to summarize
what we know so far  it s now official 
the special prosecutor
of the international war crimes court
is to launch an investigation   
   the special prosecutor announced
she was going to investigate mr  lang 
well  there was a big cheer  i can tell you 
so  let s talk to some of these protestors 
  you  sir  you re english  i believe 
  i am 
so  what brings you so far from home 
my son  he was killed
in one of mr  lang s illegal wars 
lang s never visited the injured 
he s never apologized 
i was in the british army for 30 years 
it s a disgrace 
thank you

 protesters clamoring

crowd   chanting 
liar  liar  liar 
woman   over bullhorn 
lang  lang  lang

male reporter 1  over here  mr  lang 
i apologize for keeping you waiting so long
in the cold 
male reporter 2  what s your reaction
to mr  rycart s statement 
i d like to say a few words
in response to the news from the hague 
these are strange times when
those who stand for freedom and justice
are accused of being criminals 
while those who incite hatred
and seek to destroy democracy
  are treated as victims 
  woman  war criminal 
let me make one thing perfectly clear 
while i have breath in my body 
i shall fight terrorism   
man  liar 
   whether it s on the battlefield
or  if necessary  in the courts 
thank you very much

calling to find out how i think it went 
  let him sweat 
  does he always ask for your advice 
yes 
and always usually takes it 
until lately 
  are you married 
  certainly not 
  gay 
  no 
  did you have a   
  i had a    um   
  what  girlfriend 
  well  a bit more than that 
partner 
a bit less than that 
i don t know 
40 000 years of human language
and there s no word
to describe our relationship 
it was doomed 
 chuckles 
come on  let s eat 
  how s it going 
  the book 
  well  it s not  to be honest 
  sit there 
  can i ask you something 
  of course 
i find it difficult
to understand certain things 
  what things 
  well   
i can t understand
why this good looking lad
who goes to cambridge
without the slightest interest in politics
and who spends his time acting
and chasing girls 
  suddenly ends up   
  married to me 
oh  no  not that  no  not that  at all 
no  what i don t get
is why  at 22 
he s suddenly a political activist 
  i mean  where does that come from 
  didn t you ask him 
he said he joined the party because of you 
told me a great story about you
turning up at his place in the rain 
  i was gonna start the whole book with it 
  and now you re not 
no  i can t  it s not true 
  isn t it 
  well  you know it s not 
he d been a member for two years
before he met you 
how do you know that 
i ve got a copy
of his original party membership card 
mike mcara found it in the archives 
typical mike  to ruin a good story
with too much research 
did he find anything else 
not much  cambridge stuff mainly 
you were more political than he was 
i was certainly a change
from his cambridge girlfriends 
all those jocastas and pandoras 
and so his marriage to you
must have been pretty vital 
your knowledge
and your contacts in the party 
and i thought he married me for my body 
did you ever want to be
a proper politician in your own right 
of course 
didn t you want to be a proper writer 
ouch 
i m sorry  i ve hurt your feelings 
i suppose even ghosts must have feelings 
we are sensitive spirits 
talking of spirits  could you   
let me get you a proper drink 
white wine 
never really seen the point of it 
that s the sort of thing mike used to say 
ah  at last  something in common 
do you know the coroner reckoned
he d drunk nearly half a bottle 
that s convenient 
  what do you mean 
  nothing 
  you think his death was suspicious 
  don t you 
yes 
yes  i do 
today at the beach 
i met a man  an old timer
who was familiar with the currents 
and he said that there was no way
that a body from the ferry
could have washed ashore on that spot 
you re kidding 
he also said that there was a woman who
saw flashlights on the beach that night 
and then she fell down the stairs 
and now she s in a coma  that s all i know 
that s all you know  jesus 
  can i borrow your phone 
  why 
i need to call adam 
  what 
  nothing 
  aren t you gonna call him 
  later  i m going out for a walk 
but it s pitch black  it s pouring with rain 
  it ll clear my head 
  well  i ll come with you 
no  thanks  but i need to work this one
through on my own 
stay here  have another drink 
don t wait up 
 door opening 
are you awake 
  well  i am now 
  i m sorry 
it s all right  hang on 
  what time is it 
  i don t know 
i called adam 
  and 
  can i come in 
the day before mike died 
he and adam had a terrible row 
i ve never told anyone this before 
not even the police 
  what about 
  i don t know 
but it was furious  they never spoke again 
 distant thundering 
when i asked adam about it 
he refused to discuss it 
after what you just said 
i felt i should ask him again 
and what did he say 
he was having dinner
with the vice president 
that bloody bly woman
wouldn t even give him the phone 
 sobbing 
oh  god  oh  dear god 
what s he got himself mixed up in 
it s all right  everything ll be all right 
i m scared 
i ve never been scared in my life before 
but i am now 
 crying 
your hair s all wet  you re drenched 
let me get you a towel 
 softly  bad idea 
do you mind 
course not 
the modesty of the morning after 
i m sorry  i thought you were asleep 
you mean you thought i d be gone 
you ve taken out the family tree 
he s very proud of the langs 
you know  if you want a family tree 
go to a garden center 
why have you underlined my name
every time 
i was surprised
there wasn t more about you 
why  i m just the wife 
yeah  even so 
you ought not to be written out of history 
why not  most women are 
then i ll reinstate you 
i ll put in all the occasions
that he s forgotten 
how kind  like the boss s secretary
that remembers his wife s birthday for him 
something like that  but then 
like you say  i m not a proper writer 
  what are you planning to do 
  leave 
it s not necessary  as far as i m concerned 
i m afraid it is  as far as i am 
  where will you go 
  back to the hotel 
look  i m sorry  i should never have stayed
in a client s house 
  it always ends up with   
  with you screwing the client s wife 
no  not always 
but it does make it hard
to maintain a professional distance 
and the thing we discussed last night 
what do you propose to do about that 
  that s none of my business 
  well  you can t just ignore it 
look  i m his ghostwriter 
i m not an investigative reporter 
  what are you gonna do about it 
  perhaps i ll write my own memoirs 
ex prime minister s wife tells aii 
well  if you ever decide to do that 
give me a call 
you think i need someone like you
to produce my book 
i don t want to be in his bloody memoirs 
he s on his own  i ll get a divorce 
and she can do the prison visits 
morning  sir 
  finished for the night  have we

nancy  hello 
  is that mrs  emmett 
  who is this 
i wondered if i might have a word
with professor emmett 
do you have an appointment 
it s about adam lang 
i m assisting him with his memoirs 
just a moment  please 
paul  this is paul emmett 
i think you must have made a mistake 
but you were at cambridge with mr  lang 
we were contemporaries  yes 
but i can t claim to know him 
i have a photograph of you together 
come on up to the house 
i make it a rule never to see anyone
without an appointment 
but your mention of a photograph
rather tickled my curiosity 
  please  come in 
  thank you 
yes  he s here now 
  may i 
  sure 
nancy  yes  yes  he s on his own 
he didn t say 
british  about 40 
well  well 
i literally have no recollection of this 
  but that is you 
  yes  it is 
i was on the board of the dramat 
i had quite a time of it  as you can imagine 
  the dramat 
  i m sorry  the yale dramatic association 
i maintained my theatrical interests
when i went to cambridge
for my doctoral research 
  could i keep this 
  no  i m afraid not 
  i m sure i could get you a copy 
  would you  that would be kind 
maybe you could tell me
how you came by it 
i d be happy to 
come into my study 
yes  the wall of ego 
we all have one 
it s our equivalent of the dentist s fish tank 
 chuckling 
have a seat 
so  the picture 
um   
i ve been working with adam lang
on his memoirs 
yes  i know  you told me 
yes  poor lang  it s bad business 
this posturing by the hague 
as for rycart  the worst
british foreign secretary since the war 
lang was right to fire him 
  how well do you know lang 
  hardly at all 
  you seem surprised 
  he mentions you in his memoirs 
oh  really 
well  now it s my turn to be surprised 
what does he say 
 clearing throat 
 reading indistinctly 
that s very decent of him 
as prime minister 
he always had good instincts 
  but that doesn t mean i know him 
  but the   
that  that was taken at a reception
in london
to mark the 10 year anniversary
of the arcadia 
  arcadia 
  yeah  it s a little organization that i ran 
very highbrow 
no reason why you should have heard of it 
the prime minister graced us
with his presence 
what can you remember of him
from cambridge 
  i m sorry  you don t mind  do you 
  no  not at all  go ahead 
it s just that i m rather bewildered 
no one s mentioned the cambridge
connection between us in all these years 
  but you performed together 
  in one production 
it was the summer revue 
i can t even remember what it was called 
  can i show you something else 
  if you must 
 clearing throat 
oh  my 
 chuckling 
is that what i think it is 
let s hope he didn t inhale 
but that is you standing behind him 
isn t it 
i do believe it is 
and i do believe i m on the point
of issuing a stern warning to him
on the perils of drug abuse 
is mr  lang really going to use
these pictures in his memoirs 
if so  i would prefer it if i weren t named 
my children would be mortified 
they re so much more puritanical
than we were 
  can you tell me about any of the others 
  no  i m afraid not 
the whole summer is a blur 
a very happy blur 
now  you were going to tell me
about these pictures 
i got them from michael mcara 
and he is whom  exactly 
my predecessor on lang s memoirs 
  he resigned 
  no  he died 
i m sorry to hear that 
yes  a couple of weeks ago 
he drove up here to see you 
and he died a few hours afterwards 
he drove up to see me 
no  i m afraid you re mistaken 
  how did he die 
  he drowned 
poor fellow 
i ve never really believed the myth that
death by drowning is painless  have you 
seems to me it must be agonizing 
and the police never said anything to you
about this 
i ve had no contact with the police 
but were you here that weekend 
this would have been
january  the 11th and 12th

to find your questions impertinent

  sounds fun 
  yes  it was  i was the main speaker 
look  just to return to cambridge   
no  if you don t mind 
let s not return to cambridge 
i ve said all i have to say on that subject 
i m an avid reader of political memoirs 
i ll get hold of mr  lang s when they appear 
perhaps he ll send you a copy 
for old time s sake 
i doubt that very much 
the gate will open automatically 
be sure to make a right
when you get to the end of the drive 
if you turn left  the road
will take you deeper into the woods

  i drove to new york 
  why 
i needed to see john maddox 
and where are you now 
i m still at the ferry terminal

you really are bloody hopeless 
i just had adam on the phone

you didn t tell him about us  did you 
god s sake  ruth 
 knocking on door

  mr  rycart sent me 
hold on 
just gonna do a quick check 
if you don t mind 
get your stuff together  we re leaving 
hey  that s private 
  he s clean 
  richard  thanks  frank 
sorry about that  please  get in 
  you thought it was a trap 
  it crossed my mind 
you do work for lang 
yeah  for three days  i hardly know the guy 
who does  i worked for him for 15 years 
till he fired me  and i still can t fathom him 
yeah  his wife said more or less the same 
there you go  if someone as sharp as ruth
can t get him  what hope do we have 
  tough day 
  yeah  you could say that 
you have the book 
frank  yeah 
he s got it 
before we go any further  i wonder
if i might take a look at that book 
no  before we go any further 
there s a few things i d like to know first 
such as 
why did mike mcara have your number 
okay  sure 
he was helping me 
mcara  how 
mike found the documents linking lang
to the torture flights 
what  it was mcara
who gave you the documents 
  yeah  mike mcara  the loyalest of the loyal 
  but why 
he didn t like discovering
he was working for a war criminal 
would you 
oh  i forgot  you are 
the book 
well  don t tell me
you re gonna read it now 
not all of it  just the beginning 
there s something very important about it 
yeah  it s the cure for insomnia 
there you go  guys 
can i get you anything else 
no  thanks  love 
mike said he d discovered something new 
it s the last time he called me 
he said it explained everything that had
gone wrong when we were in government 
  what was it 
  he wouldn t say over the phone 
he just kept saying if anything happened
to him  the truth was in lang s memoirs 
 it s all there in the beginning  
the beginning 
then he means cambridge 
what the hell s this 
that is lang  and that is paul emmett 
emmett  the arcadia guy  so what 
on the day that mike mcara died 
he drove up to see emmett 
and i think he was murdered
on his way home 
  what 
  i went to see emmett today 
and two guys followed me from his house 
that s why i called you 
at the time that this photograph was taken 
paul emmett was an officer in the cia 
emmett 
  foreign resources division 
  oh  my god 
you realize how important this is 
don t you 
this explains why lang went into politics 
everyone knows he didn t have
a political thought in his pretty little head 
this is why he rose so quickly 
with a little help from his friends 
  well  do you think it s possible   
  okay  a quiz for you 
name one decision lang made in 10 years
as prime minister
which wasn t in the interests of the usa 
well  come on  it s not a trick question 
iraq  middle east policy  star wars defense 
buying american nuclear missiles 
support of terrorist rendition 
the sacking of any minister
washington didn t like 
including yours truly 
mcara was right 
this explains everything 
 cell phone ringing 
it s amelia bly 
answer it 
  hello  amelia 
  good evening  i have adam for you 
 softly  lang 
adam  we re coming to get you 
what 
ruth tells me
you re stuck at the ferry terminal 
we ve just taken off from new york 
pilot says we can stop by and pick you up 
really  there s no need 
we ve got a book to write  remember 
hold on a sec  adam 
 softly  he said he wants to
pick me up in his private jet 
  say yes 
  what if it s a trap 
if you refuse  he ll get suspicious 
tell him yes 
that d be great  adam  yeah  thanks 
i ll get to the airport 
see you there 
he sounds worried 
i really don t think this is a good idea 
you have no choice 
emmett must have told lang
that i d been to see him 
so  what s he gonna do about it 
dump you in the ocean 
  well  it happened before 
  which means it can t happen again 
he can t drown two ghostwriters 
for god s sake  you re not kittens 
all this is just theory 
we don t have any proof 
  you ll get us the proof 
  me 
you re his ghostwriter 
presumably  he lets you tape him 
  i use discs  actually 
  discs  tapes 
you ve got to confront him with this 
record his reaction 
even if he denies it  it s something 
i m in a tricky position here 
i signed a confidentiality agreement 
it s a bit late for that 
  it means the discs are his property 
  the court can subpoena them 
and what if i don t record any discs 
then you ll be subpoenaed
and forced to repeat this whole story 
then i ll deny it 
then i ll give them this 
frank is recording every word 
aren t you  frank 
oh  come on 
don t look so shocked 
what did you expect 
that i d come into a meeting
with a man working for lang
without taking any precautions 
except you re not working
for lang anymore 
you re working for the good guys 
you know all this is pointless  don t you 
in the end  he ll just retire over here
with his cia pension 
and he ll tell you and the bloody
war crimes court to go and fuck yourselves 
good evening  sir 
hatherton welcomes you aboard 
thank you 
it s my first time in a private jet 
well  let s hope it s not your last 
hi  man 
  take your seat 
  thanks 
  hey  bring my ghost a calvados 
  yes  sir 
do you mind 
leave it off for now 
ruth said you were in new york
to see maddox 
  that s right 
  how was he 
he was fine 
full of energy 
  you know john 
  yes  i do know john 
as a matter of fact  i was just with him 
you never saw him today  did you 
no 
do you have something to tell me 
i went to see emmett 
 laughing  that windbag  why 
i know about you and emmett 
  me and emmett 
  i know that he was your   
  my 
   handler  if that s what they re called 
  my handler 
  yeah  that he was your handler in the cia 
 coughing 
 laughing 
oh  my god 
you re serious  aren t you 
when mcara found this 
he went to boston to show it to emmett 
and he died on the way home 
and i think he was murdered 
i think you ve had a few too many
of those already 
it was mcara who believed that emmett told
you to go into politics in the first place 
  emmett  i barely knew the man 
  and that story of yours
about why you joined the party and ruth
and the canvassing  well  the dates don t fit 
i got the dates wrong  big deal 
then when he found this photograph 
and he heard the rumors
about emmett being in the cia   
  rumors 
  it s on the internet 
i ve never heard such utter balls
in my entire life 
mike would never have believed such crap 
he was too clever  too loyal 
mike betrayed you to rycart 
  how do you know that 
  he told me 
rycart 
he s lying 
this phone number on the back
of the photograph  it s rycart s 
the handwriting  that s mcara s 
mike 
  mike  mike 
  and you knew he was disillusioned 
you had a big row with him
just before he died 
yes  i know  but he never mentioned this 
this is just    this is grotesque 
i ve never taken orders from anyone 
whatever i did 
i did because i believed it was right 
what  even supporting illegal kidnapping
for torture 
oh  for god s sake 
spare me the bleeding heart bullshit 
do you know what i d do
if i was in power again 
i d have two queues at airports 
one for flights
where we d done no background checks 
infringed on no one s civil bloody liberties 
used no intelligence gained by torture 
and on the other flight 
we d do everything we possibly could
to make it perfectly safe 
and then we d see which plane
the rycarts of this world
would put their bloody kids on 
 shouting 
and you can put that in the book 
 protesters clamoring 
man  go home 
woman  go home 
man  here comes the killer 
woman  prosecute for torture 
female reporter  over here  mr  lang 
mr  lang 
mr  lang  will you live in america 
 protesters clamoring 
mr  lang  will you take
american citizenship 
 protesters booing 
when we get back to the house 
we need to have a meeting 
 gunshot 
  ruth  oh  my god 
  murderer 
bodyguard  firing from the roof 
 indistinct shouting 
ruth  let me go to him  no  no 
move  move  move 
 police radio chatter 
fbi agent 1 
how long had you known mr  lang 
  couple of days 
  in what capacity 
i was his ghost 
his ghostwriter 
do you recognize this man 
he was one of the protestors 
his son was killed in iraq 
did you ever speak with him 
he was in the bar one night
in the hotel where i was staying 
fbi agent 2  but did you speak with him 
he asked me if i knew where adam lang
was staying on the island 
  i told him that i didn t 
  did you report this conversation 
sorry 
did you report this conversation
to mr  lang s protection team 
no 
what was mr  lang s demeanor
this evening 
he was    he was fine  he seemed fine 
one witness said she thought
she heard mr  lang shouting at you 
no 
  we re gonna need your passport 
  why 
a serious crime was just committed
in us territory  and you re the key witness 
we need to keep you close 
male reporter  like a fallen soldier 
adam lang went home today 
home to a shocked and grieving nation 
not just his family  but friends
and political opponents joined in tribute 
a great colleague and a true patriot 
we had our disagreements 
but we always stayed friends 
my heart goes out to ruth and the family 
 knocking on door 
and i would like to say adam will be   
 switches tv off 
 knocking continues 
who is it 
rick  congratulations 
on what now 
still having me as your agent  hmm 
they don t need you anymore 
you re free to go 
  you ready to get back to work 
  i don t think i can  rick 
  i m sorry  not after all this 
  don t be a jerk 
this is a hot book now 
it s adam lang s voice from the grave 
  the guy  he s a hero 
  i just want to go home 
you can 
go  go home 
and finish the book from london 
i don t know  rick 
here we are 
oh  here we are 
 sobbing 
i m sorry 
i think i m over it 
and then suddenly i realize i m not 
  are you sure this is all right 
  of course  my invitation said plus one 
only i wondered if you might ve wanted
to bring your husband 
that didn t work out 
i hadn t appreciated quite how bored
he was with being my plus one 
  shall we go in 
  yeah 
 indistinct chattering 
  amelia bly  plus one 
  thank you 
 people laughing 
that was a bit of a turn up  for the books 
you calling me 
i heard you weren t invited 
and i thought you should be here 
ghosts are never invited
to the launch party  as a rule 
we re an embarrassment 
like a mistress at a wedding 
sorry 
i brought you a present 
thank you 
 chuckles  that s very funny 
i thought  seeing as
you were so keen to hold onto it 
you might like it as a souvenir 
between you and me  it wasn t us 
it was the americans 
they thought the book was
a potential threat to national security 
but there s nothing in it 
something about the beginnings 
i think that s what i heard 
  the beginning 
  no  beginnings  the beginnings 
beginnings 
you all right 
do you know that man 
the one who s speaking to ruth 
  paul emmett 
  what s he doing here 
well  he was ruth s tutor at harvard
when she was a fulbright scholar 
why shouldn t he be here 
do you mind if i have that back a second 
i m   
waitress  madam 
woman  no  thank you 
 langs are scottish folk  originally  
 wife and child in tow  i decided to   
 i decided to settle  
man  ladies and gentlemen 
if i could have your attention  please 
thank you 
i d like to ask ruth lang to say a few words 
 guests clapping 
i miss adam all the time 
but never more than tonight 
not just  cause we re meeting
to launch his wonderful new book
and he should be here to share
the joy of his life story with us 
but because he was so brilliant
at making speeches
and i m so terrible 
 langs are scottish folk  
 wife and child  langs are scottish  
 wife  langs  lang s wife  
 lang s
 wife ruth
 was recruited
 as a cia agent
 by professor paul emmett
of harvard university  
ruth  well  you ll be relieved to hear
i m not making a speech this evening 
i just want to thank
our wonderful publishers 
marty rhinehart and john maddox 
and our attorney and friend  sidney kroll 
and finally  but especially  mike mcara 
mike  our thoughts are with you 
in these very difficult few months 
i ve drawn great comfort from this book 
from knowing that  despite the terrible
double tragedy of losing both of them 
mike and adam did at least live long
enough to complete it 
and i really believe that 
as people read these pages 
adam s voice will keep on coming through
for generations to come 
eloquent  strong and full of hope 
thanks to his words  he is with us still 
if i ve left out anyone s name 
i hope you ll forgive me 
but now i must make a toast 
to the memory of a great man
and a great patriot 
a wonderful husband and a devoted father 
to adam 
all  to adam 
 all clapping 
you were marvelous 
man  would you   
 indistinct chattering 
 engine revving 
 crashing
