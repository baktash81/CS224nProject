  hey 
in the name of his imperial majesty
and the city of vienna   
i hereby arrest eduard abramovicz

charlatanism and threats
against the empire

chief inspector uhl 
  you re late 
  my apologies  your highness 
i was attending to
the loose ends of the case 
  are there still loose ends 
  very few 
did he do it again 
how does he do it 
i m afraid i still don t know 
did you ask him 
he s not talking at this point 
well  i m sure
you have    methods   
for that kind of thing 
i want you to put an end to it 
surely you have something on him 
something from his past 
yes  yes  i think i do 
in fact  we know all about his life 
we ve spoken to almost everyone
who ever knew him 
as a boy  i m told
he had a chance encounter   
with a traveling magician 
boy 
one version
of the story was that the man himself   
then vanished   
along with the tree 
who knows what actually happened 
people began to think he had
some kind of special power   
or at least that
he was a bit different 
and then he met her 
  don t drop it 
  careful  you re going to trip 
  drop it  you muck snipe 
  oh  watch out for that hole  alley rat 
  drop it 
  come on 
pick a card 
put it back in the deck 
now  watch 
duchess von teschen  you can t be
in a place like this  they re peasants 
remember who you are 
she was brought back to the castle   
and they were forbidden
to see each other 
but soon  they were doing just that 
over the next few years  they could
always find a way to be together 
quick  come on 
in china there s a magician
that could make anything disappear 
a house  a wagon  anything 
we ll go visit him  they can t stop us
if we want to be together 
they ll never find us 
do you promise
you ll take me with you 
one day i will

  sophie 
eduard 
  sophie 
  eduard 
sophie 
stay away from her  or next time   
we ll arrest you and your family 
what happened next remains a mystery 
we do know that
he traveled the world   
that he began to perform
his magic in public   
that he changed his name
to eisenheim 
and then almost 15 years later   
he appeared in vienna 
life and death   
space and time   
fate and chance 
these are the forces
of the universe 
tonight  ladies and gentleman   
i present to you a man who has
unlocked these mysteries 
from the furthest corners
of the world   
where the dark arts
still hold sway   
he returns to us to demonstrate   
how nature s laws may be bent 
i give you    eisenheim 
might i borrow a handkerchief
from someone 
you  madam 
thank you 
ah  be patient 
now  if you please 
i would like to continue
with an examination of time 
from the moment we enter this life 
we are in the flow of it 
we measure it and we mark it 
but we cannot defy it 
we cannot even speed it up
or slow it down 
or can we 
have we not each
experienced the sensation   
that a beautiful moment
seemed to pass too quickly   
and wished that
we could make it linger 
or felt time slow on a dull day   
and wished that we could
speed things up a bit 
i assure you  they re quite real 
is it real  let s see 
and you  madam 
where is your handkerchief 
bravo 
very good 
give us something  please 
  please  give us something  please 
  what s all this 
we re poor 
  do you think you re poor 
  yes 
i want to show you something 
you re not poor 
you have everything
that you need right here 
thank you 
thank you 
thank you 
and that s yours 
and this too 
i ve got the magic one 
  good morning 
  good morning 
  coffee 
  no 
  strudel  i have two 
  nothing  thank you 
you look very pleased with yourself 
how are the receipts 
  not bad  a three quarter house 
  well done 
but we re going to do better
than that  listen to this 
listen   there is no argument
that his uncanny displays   
 separate him from the ranks
of garden variety stage wizards 
 some of his effects
transcend mere illusion   
 and approach the realm of art 
he is very young
to be so masterful   
do you see 
we ll pack the house with this review 
we are going to make more money
than you ever dreamed of 
but if it was mechanical 
maybe he had it wrapped
in some kind of bark 
oh  i know  of course
i thought of that 
it s the butterflies
i m trying to work out 
oh  for pete s sake 
invisible wire 
too obvious  how many men
have you detailed for tonight 
we have eight men inside 
another eight out front 
perhaps you ll get another look
at your butterflies 
mmm 
  come on in 
  check the last 10 rows there 
you  don t touch that 
  put that down 
  ah  herr eisenheim 
who are you and what do you
think you re doing 
i m chief inspector walter uhl
and i m inspecting your theater 
i ve seen you perform 
very impressive 
  very impressive 
  how can we help you  inspector 
you will be honored to know
the crown prince   
plans to attend
your performance tonight 
  the crown prince 
  yes 
so  obviously we have
to inspect the theater 
i think that one s small
for an assassin  don t you 
yes  the orange tree 
you know  i have seen things
like this before   
but never one like that 
  extraordinary 
  thank you 
i have been puzzling
over how it works   
especially how the butterflies fly 
i assure you 
your secret is safe with me 
i m an officer of the law after all 
and a bit of an amateur conjurer 
  are you really 
  yes 
well  card tricks  coins 
uh  sleight of hand  yes 
hmm 
but nothing fancy 
perhaps you ll give me a tip 
yes  all right 
i ll show you one i m very fond of 
are you a gambling man 
  on occasion  yes 
  i will bet you the secret of the orange tree   
that i can guess which hand
you place this in every time 
excellent 
put it in your fist  raise your hand
against your forehead   
concentrate on it 
form a mental picture 
  yes 
  have you got it 
  yes 
  put your hands in front of you 
it s in your left 
  well 
  a lucky guess  perhaps 
you have a confederate
who signals you 
  no  it s more primitive than that 
  uh huh 
when you raise your hand to your head 
the blood drains from it 
it will be paler every time 
oh  oh  i like that very much 
please take it with my compliments 
why  thank you 
eh  the blood drains 
now  inspector   
if you don t mind  i ve got to prepare
for tonight s performance 
ah 
please stand for his imperial highness   
crown prince leopold 
i thought we might end this evening
with a discussion of the soul 
all of the greatest religions   
speak of the soul s endurance
beyond the end of life 
so  what then
does it mean    to die 
i need a volunteer
from the audience 
someone not afraid of death 
please  someone 
i assure you 
no tragedy will befall you 
it s an honor  duchess von teschen 
do you know me 
no 
you re quite certain
that we ve never met before 
yes  of course 
now please gaze
directly into my eyes 
look nowhere else 
wave to yourself 
turn in a circle 
now bow to yourself 
away 
they must have liked you  they ve
waited for you nearly five minutes 
your highness  may i introduce
eisenheim the illusionist 
  well done 
  thank you for coming  i hope you enjoyed it 
oh  we more than enjoyed it 
stimulated great debate
amongst us  hasn t it 
except of course for your assistant 
duchess von teschen 
you seemed to have struck her
quite speechless  a feat in itself 
  did you hypnotize her 
  in a fashion 
i d like to learn that trick 
rainier here thinks you have
supernatural powers 
do you claim supernatural powers 
i ve never said anything
of that kind 
  then you won t mind a question or two 
  now let s not ruin it 
you needn t divulge
anything i can t guess 
as you wish 
your assistants
are behind the mirror   
somewhere in robes obviously 
lights in the frame perhaps
to illuminate them  or angled mirrors 
that would be one way to do it 
i think i understand it all
except the ghost 
that was very  very good 
another viewing perhaps 
you must come to the hofburg next time 
we ll make an evening of it 
that will be my pleasure 
so be it 
sophie 
and we ll gather
our best minds next time 
you ll really have a challenge then 
then i ll prepare something special 
perhaps i ll make you disappear 
my god 
when he volunteered her   
i heard the crashing sound
of money falling on me in piles 
every lady of means in vienna will
want to get up there with you now 
  mmm 
  what a show off 
his father would have died
if he had seen such a display 
  she didn t seem too happy about it either 
  she d better get used to it 
  how s that 
  word is she ll marry him soon 
  really 
  taking her chances if you ask me 
  why 
  he likes to give his lady friends   
a good thrashing now and again 
people say he pushed one of them
off a balcony   
just to cover
the beating he d given her 
for herr eisenheim 
hello  sophie 
when i was on the stage 
you knew me right away 
it took me a moment   
but  yes  i knew 
you could have said something 
i thought you d figure
it out eventually 
yes  i would have 
i would have come another night 
volunteered   
walked right on stage
and said   hello   
and then you d really
have had to move quickly 
i suspect you would have 
i don t understand why 
perhaps for the same reasons you
find it prudent to meet in a carriage 
it s just a game
i have to play with them 
i m followed everywhere  it s 
it s supposed to be for my protection 
yes 
so  i hear congratulations
are in order 
what for 
they say you ll be the princess 
  it s not decided at all 
  ah 
it makes a certain sense  i suppose 
we ve known each other for years 
and of course  our families 
he s very intelligent 
a little too intelligent
for his own good 
you re lucky  you know   
to have broken free as you did 
i often wish that i had 
wished what 
wished that i would see you again 
and now you have 
yes  now i have 
i look forward to seeing you
again at the hofburg 
until then 
here s the report
on duchess von teschen 
mmm  anything interesting 
see for yourself 
the magician 
they drove around for half an hour 
then he got out near the theater 
what do you want us to do 
join us for a drink 
please 
you like something to eat 
something to drink  hmm 
  no  thank you 
  herr eisenheim   
i m going to ask you a question   
that may not seem friendly   
but i assure you  in fact  is 
what is your relationship
with the duchess von teschen 
you re right 
that doesn t seem friendly 
oh  but that is precisely my point 
for  you see 
where others might judge   
a discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be   
i am willing to find out
what it actually was 
all right  we were
childhood acquaintances 
acquaintances 
childhood friends 
my father was a cabinetmaker 
he made the furniture
for her family s house 
i see  the cabinetmaker s son
friends with a 
  has there been a complaint 
  oh  no  no  if there d been a complaint   
well  we d be having a very  uh 
different sort of conversation 
yes  he relies on you for
that sort of thing  does he 
i m a simple public servant 
herr eisenheim 
that s not what i hear 
i hear you ll be
the chief of police very soon 
  maybe mayor of vienna  party secretary 
  all subject to his whim 
you better hope he doesn t dissolve
the parliament before you get there 
now the prince has some progressive ideas 
but he will make a fine emperor 
well  they say you re very close to him 
so i m sure you ll do fine 
look  yes  indeed  they say
that i m very close to the prince 
but the simple truth of the matter is 
herr eisenheim  i m the son of a butcher 
he s the heir to the empire 
how close could we be to such as him 
hmm  do you see my point 
don t fool yourself that
you can play in their game 
i ve served on the edge of it   
for    many  many years   
and i can tell you with certainty   
there s no trick they haven t seen 
it s not worth it 
my guest tonight   
is not a showman at all 
but rather a wizard   
who has sold his soul
to the devil   
in return for unholy powers 
or so at least some of our friends here
would have us believe 
but fear not 
everything can
and will be explained 
  all mysteries penetrated 
  hear  hear 
well said  well said 
  is that the emperor 
  ah  yes  your father 
i didn t think he was invited 
bravo 
a fair likeness of the old man 
too modern a style for him  of course 
i m afraid i m not much
of a painter 
it s true  there are no brushstrokes
in this painting 
i can see that clearly 
so to achieve the color   
some sort of chemical must
be interacting  presumably 
some sort of sprayer up your sleeve 
  may i 
  if you feel you must 
  i do 
  oh  let the man do his show 
you want me to just sit there
when it s so obvious 
i do 
he tries to trick you 
i try to enlighten you 
which is the more noble pursuit 
may we have the lights  please   
so his highness can better see 
  see here  leopold  let s have the show 
  hear  hear 
  come on  leopold 
  get on with it 
very well  i propose a challenge 
why don t you astonish us   
if you can   
without all the    gadgetry 
as you wish 
your sword is very beautiful 
might i see it 
certainly 
may i 
where does power flow from 
skill or destiny  or divine right 
we all know the story
of a sword called excalibur 
excalibur s blade
was fixed in stone   
and there it stayed 
many worthy knights tried to
pull the sword from the stone 
only arthur succeeded   
proving his right to rule 
who can take this sword 
you  sir  can you take the sword 
no surprise there 
perhaps you  sir 
not so eager  cousin 
come on  you can do it 
  do it  do it 
  come on 
you shall live a long life 
thank you for your indulgence 
come now  if you can t pull it out 
you ll never be emperor 
your father will live to be a hundred 
the sword to its rightful owner 
that s enough light entertainment
for this evening 
for more serious discussion 
please join me for a drink 
shut him down 
well  he s very popular 
your highness 
i m sure you ll find a way 
  what did you do to him 
  i gave him what he asked for 
what would possess you
to do something so foolish 
duchess von teschen 
you must come along  my dear 
we don t want to keep
the prince waiting 
  did you enjoy the show 
  it was wonderful  wasn t it 
it was amusing 
who told you where to find me 
your manager  i told him if he wants
to stay in vienna  you need my help 
ah  so i m to be driven
from the city  is that it 
  good  i shall relish it 
  stop it 
i came here to try to help you 
why  why should you possibly
care what happens to me now 
you were my friend 
i am your friend 
we knew each other very briefly
a long time ago  you don t know me at all 
then why did you speak to me 
why did you even bother talking 
and you kept it all this time 
i used to sit and stare
at your picture   
trying to imagine where you were 
at night i d have dreams
i had gone with you   
and then i d wake up
and realize where i was 
but in my dreams you
had shorter hair and no beard 
where did you go when you left 
to my uncle s farm near prague 
how exotic 
i went to russia   
then asia minor   
and then the orient for many years 
so long 
i always meant to return 
i just  i kept thinking i d find it
around the next corner 
what 
a real mystery 
i saw remarkable things   
but the only mystery
i never solved was   
why my heart couldn t let go of you 
he wants me to go to budapest   
with him next week
to announce our engagement 
he wants the hungarians behind him 
they re going to crown him king 
i m sure his father will have
something to say about that 
he plans to overthrow his father 
that could go very badly for him   
and for you 
you shouldn t be involved 
i am part of his plan 
he only gets hungary by
aligning himself with my family 
  leave him 
  it s not that easy 
call it off and come away with me 
or don t say anything
and we ll just go 
as long as we re alive   
he ll hunt us 
and when he finds us  he ll kill us 
look at me 
do you truly want to leave with me 
yes  i do 
there you are  as i predicted 
they ve shut us down 
are you happy now  hmm 
you made your point 
it doesn t matter that we were
sold out for the whole run 
no  look  you got it off your chest 
  do we have money 
  what 
  do we have any money saved 
  yes  we have some 
but we could have had
much  much more 
mmm  it will have to do 
and the second account  all of it 
of course  herr eisenheim 
thank you 
and you have no doubt
it was duchess von teschen 
i d stake my life on it 
what was in this suitcase 
i don t know 
he s by the first car 
the map will show you where to meet 
when it s done  you ll travel ahead
with her and i shall follow 
and she understands
everything this entails 
completely  there s not a lot of time 
as you know  we sometimes follow   
duchess von teschen
for her protection 
yesterday she was seen
in the company of another man 
what man 
eisenheim the illusionist 
what were they doing 
  well  they were meeting and  uh 
  touching  kissing 
fornicating 
not that we observed  no 
however  i have reason to believe that
they may be planning something together 
it s possible they may be leaving 
i m not certain of anything yet 
your highness 
thank you  inspector 
we can  of course  acquire more information 
he spent the afternoon
in vienna with his father 
he s expected shortly 
what a surprise 
i thought you didn t like it here 
i suppose you think
you re very clever   
and very democratic
in your friendships 
  aren t you 
  what are you talking about 
your magician friend 
i know you ve been with him 
it s true  we ve been
friends since childhood 
you sleep with all
your childhood friends 
i will not be spoken to this way 
  you ll be spoken to as i wish to speak to you 
  you re drunk 
you re getting quite old 
aren t you 
you know  my mother was 16 years old
when she married my father 
and you  can you even bear children 
are you any use at all 
  are you trying to embarrass me 
  it has nothing to do with you 
it has everything to do with me 
you will not share my bed
if you ve slept with him 
you don t understand 
i m not going to share
your bed at all 
i m not going to budapest with you 
i don t want to be part
of what you re planning 
and i will not marry you 
i assume you haven t been so stupid
as to tell him anything 
 cause if you disrupt my plans  i will have
no further use for you  do you understand 
now  you will travel
to budapest tomorrow 
i recommend that you are here early 
packed and ready to go 
do nothing more to embarrass me 
good bye 
what do you mean   good bye  
come back here 
come back here 
don t disobey me again 
whore 
out of my way 
please  don t 
no  leave that 
leave all the lanterns 
duchess von teschen 
duchess von teschen 
maybe look on that side 
over here 
whoa  whoa 
i thought you saw her
get on the train with him 
no  sir  we were waiting in vienna
for them  but they left from baden 
we assumed she was with him 
should i wire
the crown prince in budapest 
it s been done 
  who are you 
  i m the family s doctor 
are you the chief inspector 
yes  i am  you understand
this is a police matter now 
  of course i understand 
  good  good 
  you have determined the cause of death 
  she bled to death 
there s a wound on her throat   
just above the left collarbone 
perhaps from a knife or a sword 
may i take a look 
inspector  i i will
not stand for it 
the crown prince
will not stand for it 
this is not some circus sideshow 
my apologies  of course 
thank you  doctor 
probably robbed 
gypsies  maybe 
saw all those diamonds 
couldn t say no 
chief inspector 
there s one thing you should know 
  yes  what is that 
  in the folds of her dress   
i found this small gemstone 
seen last thursday at 7 30 p  m  
riding without an escort   
toward the imperial hunting lodge 
groomsman said
she arrived about 8 30 
what was she doing riding alone 
he did this 
you know he did 
  i know who did what 
  the crown prince 
he killed her  he s done it
before  and you know it 
no  i don t know that  in fact 
i m sure he didn t  he s in budapest 
  he killed her before he left 
  i m afraid the facts don t support your theory 
  she was leaving him 
  for who  you 
  yes 
  don t be absurd  herr eisenheim 
he killed her because
he couldn t let her go 
  she knew his secret 
  what secret 
  ask your inspector  he knows 
  stop this right now 
are you completely corrupt 
no  not completely  no 
which is why i ll advise you not to accuse
anyone  especially his imperial highness 
or you will end up in jail yourself 
  where s the guard who let her out of the gate 
  gone with the crown prince 
  did any of the servants see her leave 
  all asleep 
ah ha 
what about him 
he  uh  he put her horse
in the first stall when she arrived 
ah 
was it this one 
we don t have jurisdiction
on imperial property 
thank you 
i know 
so what are you doing 
investigating 
listening to that magician  are you 
for all we know  he did it 
no  i think not 
the crown prince is back 
chief inspector 
we should go  now 
what have you found out 
  she was last seen riding here  alone 
  yes 
and based on your information 
i then threw her out 
  did she commit suicide 
  no  it was surely murder 
  do you have a suspect 
  we will soon  your highness 
later that week  we arrested
a man and charged him with murder   
but i knew that
that wouldn t satisfy eisenheim 
i had my men continue to watch him 
he finally emerged from his grief
and bought a rundown theater 
it s perfect 
he fired his manager   
and began preparing
for a new kind of show 
who is he 
my name is frankel 
  where did you come from 
  i come from brunn 
my father is a lens grinder there 
how have you come
to be here tonight 
  i don t know 
  are you alive 
what can you tell us
about the other side 
  what s it like 
  yes  tell us 
you must know things  secret things 
say something spiritual 
they don t seem
to think it s a trick 
eisenheim  come out and talk to us 
eisenheim s audience
had always been enthusiastic   
but now he was attracting a more   
impassioned following 
madame  please 
with these spirits 
these manifestations   
eisenheim has given us hard proof   
of the soul s immortality 
the spirit has been reaffirmed   
in the face of modern 
scientific materialism 
the work of spiritualism
will rouse humanity   
to a new  moral earnestness 
 it is a revolutionary movement 
and we will turn the empire   
into a spiritual republic   
do you think eisenheim s behind all this 
why must i be bothered
with a magician 
he is proving to be more
than a magician  your highness 
he is a charlatan 
he s a faker 
he pretends to have
supernatural powers 
put him on trial for fraud 
  first  we have to show it is fraud 
  then do it 
find out how the trick is done 
and then arrest him 
this is just a rough demonstration 
inspector 
but you can see how it could work 
yes  i see 
not bad  not bad 
we need a spy in eisenheim s troupe 
  those orientals  they won t give us anything 
  mm 
  i already tried 
  yeah  then try something else 
what has happened here 
one of those ghosts from
the theater down the street 
  yes  up there 
  where 
  there 
  right there  and it s a boy 
  yes  look  look 
  sick 
  where is this thing 
  right there 
  over there 
  uh huh  did you see it 
mm 
god  an apparition  i saw it  i swear 
  yes 
  right over there 
where are you taking him 
i want to know how it s done 
first the orange tree  now this 
do i have to share all my professional
secrets with the police 
well  in this case  yes 
or i ll be forced to arrest you 
  on what charge 
  oh  well  we ll start with fraud 
  excuse me  chief inspector 
  what 
i think you should look
outside the window 
  who are they 
  they are here for him 
oh 
my goodness  you have
a devoted following 
  what is it they expect of you 
  i have no idea 
what do your spies tell you 
that you plan to subvert
the monarchy  perhaps 
why  just because
the crown prince is a murderer 
he s not a murderer 
we have the real murderer in prison 
  he pleaded guilty 
  you ve got the wrong man 
  you don t know that 
  no  but you do 
hmm 
herr eisenheim  you will
also go to prison   
if you don t explain to me
what it is you are doing 
  let him go 
  or we will 
the sentence will be greater
if that mob attacks the building 
eisenheim  eisenheim  eisenheim 
well 
what are you doing 
stop 
  stop 
  eisenheim 
there he is 
listen to me  please 
you must listen to me  please 
thank you all for coming  i have been
speaking with the chief inspector 
and i think there s been
a serious misunderstanding 
i want you all to know   
that everything that you have seen
in my theater is an illusion 
it s a trick 
it s not real 
i can t bring loved ones
back from the grave 
i can t receive messages
from the other side 
i apologize if i ve given
you any false hope 
my intention has only been
to entertain  nothing more 
now i appreciate your support 
but you must go home 
please  you must go 
there  now  i ve explained it 
so it can t be fraud 
may i go 
has he tricked you 
is that it 
no  your highness 
then why are you failing me 
i thought i could trust you 
i thought you were a man i could bring
with me when i took the throne 
  am i wrong about you 
  no  you re not wrong  your highness  no 
i need men who can complete
the tasks assigned to them 
instead  i m surrounded by fools 
in the end  i must
do everything myself 
  i can see this case will be no different 
  mm 
  how do i look 
  ordinary  your highness 
very ordinary 
i think i m going to enjoy this 
  they don t recognize you 
  good 
and keep your distance  i don t want
to be seen with a policeman 
who are you 
are you duchess von teschen 
yes 
what s happened to you 
she was murdered 
were you murdered 
by who 
did they arrest the right man 
tell us  please  who murdered you 
  tell us 
  someone  here 
tell us  and point him out 
was it the crown prince 
he s killed a woman before 
hey  the crown prince isn t even here 
the crown prince
killed her  something must be done 
chief inspector  are you sure
you have the right man 
  quite sure  excuse me 
  did you investigate the crown prince 
he cannot continue if this is true 
  he must be brought to justice 
  it s not true 
the magic trick is not evidence 
what is your name 
  i don t see how that matters 
  i advise you to watch what you say  sir 
that actress didn t even
look like sophie 
but the audience is
stupid and he knows it 
he manipulates them 
he himself said nothing 
his actress said nothing
inflammatory 
he left it to the audience
to make their accusations 
all plants paid for
by him  of course 
i don t suppose you made
a note of those people 
i m afraid we didn t
have enough men tonight 
at the next performance 
i want them all arrested 
every one of them 
eisenheim  the whole troupe 
i want to have an example
made of him   
in front of all his followers 
that was very foolish last night 
you can t destroy him  you know 
  you can t bring down the monarchy 
  oh  i know i can t 
then don t raise her again 
don t provoke those questions 
eisenheim  i don t
want to arrest you 
i m a cynical man  god knows   
but if your manifestations
are somehow real   
then even i m willing to admit 
you re a very special person 
and if it s a trick 
then it s equally impressive 
either way  you have a gift 
so don t make me put you in jail 
promise me you won t do it again 
i promise you  you ll
enjoy this next show 
what do you want 
  nothing 
  then why bring her back 
just to be with her 
to be with her 
  everything is ready 
  yes  sir 
  we re trying to assess how he might escape 
  he will not escape 
  i want guards at every door and window 
  sir 
i want to apologize to you
for my behavior of late 
but i want to make it up to you 
if you ll listen to a proposition 
  well  i don t know 
  i ll make it worth your while  josef 
you know  i m very busy right now  i haven t
just been sitting around waiting for you 
no  no  of course 
i want you to assume control
of all my finances 
and my assets 
  everything 
  everything 
yes  including this theater   
and all the receipts from
tonight s performance   
which i offer with
my sincere thanks 
  what do you say 
  all right 
  i ll do it 
  good  good 
would you like me
to introduce you tonight 
no  tonight  just enjoy the show 
excuse me  chief inspector 
i m josef fischer  eisenheim s manager 
yes  i remember 
  what s going on  why all the police 
  precautions  herr fischer 
  precautions 
  are you planning to arrest eisenheim 
oh  that s entirely up to him 
there  there 
it s duchess von teschen 
why were you murdered 
  i was leaving him 
  leaving who 
  the crown prince 
  of course it was 
  we won t stand for it 
  i tried to get away 
i was wearing my locket when i died 
but now it s gone 
it s lost 
  tell us  please  who murdered you 
  was it the crown prince 
we must do something 
  come along 
  we must help her 
to the front 
step out 
in the name of
his imperial majesty   
and the city of vienna 
i hereby arrest eduard abramovicz 
also known as
eisenheim the illusionist 
on charges of
disturbing public order   
charlatanism and
threats against the empire 
  no 
  get back  get back 
stop it  stop it  all of you 
  he disappeared 
  where is he 
find him 
  where is he 
  he was right there 
  how was his trick done 
  no trick 
  how is it done 
  i don t know  nobody know 
damn it 
i had my driver take
the sword to police headquarters 
my men will examine it and see
if it matches the gemstone   
found on duchess von teschen s body 
i have no doubt that it will 
and after that  i came in here   
and you asked me why i was late 
you ve stolen imperial property 
that seems trivial
compared with murder 
even if that were true  you have
no jurisdiction here 
that s right  you may do as you wish here 
without consequence 
nobody can punish you 
  except one man 
  who s that 
the emperor 
i don t suppose he ll leave his crown
to a murderer  do you 
  he ll never believe you 
  maybe not 
hmm 
but  i wrote a letter
to his general staff   
telling them    everything 
including your plan
to overthrow the emperor 
i know they ll listen to that 
you ll not take the throne 
not with my help 
you no longer want to be chief of police 
mayor of vienna 
you don t want to be
a baron  an aristocrat 
i m afraid that s out of
the question at this point 
you fool 
he s tricking you 
he s manipulating you  he had the sword
at a command performance 
he could have pried the stones loose then
and planted them here 
  he has planted everything 
  you re drunk 
it s all a trick 
it s an illusion 
perhaps there s truth
in this illusion 
you need to wire your driver 
and have the sword returned 
  or what 
  i ll shoot you  perhaps i ll shoot you anyway 
and then you ll have killed
a police inspector and a duchess 
or perhaps you ll kill yourself 
you  uh  committed suicide 
distraught at having failed your leader 
ah  some officers
of the general staff  i d guess 
they must have received my letter 
  what do you want 
  i don t want anything 
fine  fine  you shall have nothing 
  gentlemen 
  the situation is so obvious 
everyone s completely incompetent 
my father runs the empire
into the ground   
and no one notices  no one
knows anything about it 
i propose to clean up
the mess  and you betray me 
you re all becoming irrelevant 
you will be replaced 
the country will be run by mongrels 
there s a thousand different voices screaming
to be heard  and nothing will be done 
nothing 
i ve done everything i can 
too much 
far too much 
your highness 
are you in there 
your highness  open the door 
please  open the door 
by your father s authority   
i insist you open the door 
you must open the door 
you re all fools 
  please  your highness 
  i can t stand it 
i won t stand it 
break down the door  break it down 
  what happened 
  the crown prince just shot himself 
are you chief inspector uhl 
i used to be 
you 
who gave you this 
  who gave you this 
  herr eisenheim 
when 
look out 
all aboard 
tickets and papers 
all aboard 
when it s done   
you ll travel ahead
with her  and i will follow 
  and she understands everything this entails 
  completely 
do you think that
eisenheim s behind all this 
so  what does it mean  to die 
  what do you want 
  to be with her 
to be with her 
chief inspector 
there s one thing you should know 
your sword
is very beautiful  might i see it 
  you re drunk 
  you were drunk
