you have methods
for that kind of thing
i want you to put an end to it

something from his past
yes yes i think i do
in fact we know all about his life
weve spoken to almost everyone
who ever knew him
as a boy im told
he had a chance encounter
with a traveling magician
boy
one version
of the story was that the man himself
then vanished
along with the tree
who knows what actually happened
people began to think he had
some kind of special power
or at least that
he was a bit different
and then he met her
dont drop it
careful youre going to trip

oh watch out for that hole alley rat
drop it

duchess von teschen you cant be
in a place like this theyre peasants

always find a way to be together

well arrest you and your family
what happened next remains a mystery
we do know that
he traveled the world
that he began to perform
his magic in public
that he changed his name
to eisenheim
and then almost 15 years later
he appeared in vienna
life and death
space and time
fate and chance
these are the forces
of the universe
tonight ladies and gentleman
i present to you a man who has
unlocked these mysteries
from the furthest corners
of the world
where the dark arts
still hold sway
he returns to us to demonstrate
how natures laws may be bent
i give you eisenheim
might i borrow a handkerchief
from someone
you madam
thank you
ah be patient
now if you please
i would like to continue
with an examination of time
from the moment we enter this life
we are in the flow of it
we measure it and we mark it
but we cannot defy it
we cannot even speed it up
or slow it down
or can we
have we not each
experienced the sensation
that a beautiful moment
seemed to pass too quickly
and wished that
we could make it linger
or felt time slow on a dull day
and wished that we could
speed things up a bit
i assure you theyre quite real
is it real lets see
and you madam
where is your handkerchief
bravo
very good
give us something please
please give us something please
whats all this
were poor
do you think youre poor
yes
i want to show you something
youre not poor
you have everything
that you need right here
thank you
thank you
thank you
and thats yours
and this too
ive got the magic one
good morning
good morning
coffee
no
strudel i have two
nothing thank you
you look very pleased with yourself
how are the receipts
not bad a threequarter house
well done
but were going to do better
than that listen to this
listen there is no argument
that his uncanny displays
separate him from the ranks
of gardenvariety stage wizards
some of his effects
transcend mere illusion
and approach the realm of art
he is very young
to be so masterful
do you see
well pack the house with this review
we are going to make more money
than you ever dreamed of
but if it was mechanical
maybe he had it wrapped
in some kind of bark
oh i know of course
i thought of that
its the butterflies
im trying to work out
oh for petes sake
invisible wire
too obvious how many men
have you detailed for tonight
we have eight men inside
another eight out front
perhaps youll get another look
at your butterflies
mmm
come on in
check the last 10 rows there
you dont touch that
put that down
ah herr eisenheim
who are you and what do you
think youre doing
im chief inspector walter uhl
and im inspecting your theater
ive seen you perform
very impressive
very impressive
how can we help you inspector
you will be honored to know
the crown prince
plans to attend
your performance tonight
the crown prince
yes
so obviously we have
to inspect the theater
i think that ones small
for an assassin dont you
yes the orange tree
you know i have seen things
like this before
but never one like that
extraordinary
thank you
i have been puzzling
over how it works
especially how the butterflies fly
i assure you
your secret is safe with me
im an officer of the law after all
and a bit of an amateur conjurer
are you really
yes
well card tricks coins
uh sleight of hand yes
hmm
but nothing fancy
perhaps youll give me a tip
yes all right
ill show you one im very fond of
are you a gambling man
on occasion yes
i will bet you the secret of the orange tree
that i can guess which hand
you place this in every time
excellent
put it in your fist raise your hand
against your forehead
concentrate on it
form a mental picture
yes
have you got it
yes
put your hands in front of you
its in your left
well
a lucky guess perhaps
you have a confederate
who signals you
no its more primitive than that
uhhuh
when you raise your hand to your head
the blood drains from it
it will be paler every time
oh oh i like that very much
please take it with my compliments
why thank you
eh the blood drains
now inspector
if you dont mind ive got to prepare
for tonights performance
ah
please stand for his imperial highness
crown prince leopold
i thought we might end this evening
with a discussion of the soul
all of the greatest religions
speak of the souls endurance
beyond the end of life
so what then
does it mean to die
i need a volunteer
from the audience
someone not afraid of death
please someone
i assure you
no tragedy will befall you
its an honor duchess von teschen
do you know me
no
youre quite certain
that weve never met before
yes of course
now please gaze
directly into my eyes
look nowhere else
wave to yourself
turn in a circle
now bow to yourself
away
they must have liked you theyve
waited for you nearly five minutes
your highness may i introduce
eisenheim the illusionist
well done
thank you for coming i hope you enjoyed it
oh we more than enjoyed it
stimulated great debate
amongst us hasnt it
except of course for your assistant
duchess von teschen
you seemed to have struck her
quite speechless a feat in itself
did you hypnotize her
in a fashion
id like to learn that trick
rainier here thinks you have
supernatural powers
do you claim supernatural powers
ive never said anything
of that kind
then you wont mind a question or two
now lets not ruin it
you neednt divulge
anything i cant guess
as you wish
your assistants
are behind the mirror
somewhere in robes obviously
lights in the frame perhaps
to illuminate them or angled mirrors
that would be one way to do it
i think i understand it all
except the ghost
that was very very good
another viewing perhaps
you must come to the hofburg next time
well make an evening of it
that will be my pleasure
so be it
sophie
and well gather
our best minds next time
youll really have a challenge then
then ill prepare something special
perhaps ill make you disappear
my god
when he volunteered her
i heard the crashing sound
of money falling on me in piles
every lady of means in vienna will
want to get up there with you now
mmm
what a showoff
his father would have died
if he had seen such a display
she didnt seem too happy about it either
shed better get used to it
hows that
word is shell marry him soon
really
taking her chances if you ask me
why
he likes to give his lady friends
a good thrashing now and again
people say he pushed one of them
off a balcony
just to cover
the beating hed given her
for herr eisenheim
hello sophie
when i was on the stage
you knew me right away
it took me a moment
but yes i knew
you could have said something
i thought youd figure
it out eventually
yes i would have
i would have come another night
volunteered
walked right on stage
and said hello
and then youd really
have had to move quickly
i suspect you would have
i dont understand why
perhaps for the same reasons you
find it prudent to meet in a carriage
its just a game
i have to play with them
im followed everywhere its
its supposed to be for my protection
yes
so i hear congratulations
are in order
what for
they say youll be the princess
its not decided at all
ah
it makes a certain sense i suppose
weve known each other for years
and of course our families
hes very intelligent
a little too intelligent
for his own good
youre lucky you know
to have broken free as you did
i often wish that i had
wished what
wished that i would see you again
and now you have
yes now i have
i look forward to seeing you
again at the hofburg
until then
heres the report
on duchess von teschen
mmm anything interesting
see for yourself
the magician
they drove around for half an hour
then he got out near the theater
what do you want us to do
join us for a drink
please
you like something to eat
something to drink hmm
no thank you
herr eisenheim
im going to ask you a question
that may not seem friendly
but i assure you in fact is
what is your relationship
with the duchess von teschen
youre right
that doesnt seem friendly
oh but that is precisely my point
for you see
where others might judge
a discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be
i am willing to find out
what it actually was
all right we were
childhood acquaintances
acquaintances
childhood friends
my father was a cabinetmaker
he made the furniture
for her familys house
i see the cabinetmakers son
friends with a
has there been a complaint
oh no no if thered been a complaint
well wed be having a very uh
different sort of conversation
yes he relies on you for
that sort of thing does he
im a simple public servant
herr eisenheim
thats not what i hear
i hear youll be
the chief of police very soon
maybe mayor of vienna party secretary
all subject to his whim
you better hope he doesnt dissolve
the parliament before you get there
now the prince has some progressive ideas
but he will make a fine emperor
well they say youre very close to him
so im sure youll do fine
look yes indeed they say
that im very close to the prince
but the simple truth of the matter is
herr eisenheim im the son of a butcher
hes the heir to the empire
how close could we be to such as him
hmm do you see my point
dont fool yourself that
you can play in their game
ive served on the edge of it
for many many years
and i can tell you with certainty
theres no trick they havent seen
its not worth it
my guest tonight
is not a showman at all
but rather a wizard
who has sold his soul
to the devil
in return for unholy powers
or so at least some of our friends here
would have us believe
but fear not
everything can
and will be explained
all mysteries penetrated
hear hear
well said well said
is that the emperor
ah yes your father
i didnt think he was invited
bravo
a fair likeness of the old man
too modern a style for him of course
im afraid im not much
of a painter
its true there are no brushstrokes
in this painting
i can see that clearly
so to achieve the color
some sort of chemical must
be interacting presumably
some sort of sprayer up your sleeve
may i
if you feel you must
i do
oh let the man do his show
you want me to just sit there
when its so obvious
i do
he tries to trick you
i try to enlighten you
which is the more noble pursuit
may we have the lights please
so his highness can better see
see here leopold lets have the show
hear hear
come on leopold
get on with it
very well i propose a challenge
why dont you astonish us
if you can
without all the gadgetry
as you wish
your sword is very beautiful
might i see it
certainly
may i
where does power flow from
skill or destiny or divine right
we all know the story
of a sword called excalibur
excaliburs blade
was fixed in stone
and there it stayed
many worthy knights tried to
pull the sword from the stone
only arthur succeeded
proving his right to rule
who can take this sword
you sir can you take the sword
no surprise there
perhaps you sir
not so eager cousin
come on you can do it
do it do it
come on
you shall live a long life
thank you for your indulgence
come now if you cant pull it out
youll never be emperor
your father will live to be a hundred
the sword to its rightful owner
thats enough light entertainment
for this evening
for more serious discussion
please join me for a drink
shut him down
well hes very popular
your highness
im sure youll find a way
what did you do to him
i gave him what he asked for
what would possess you
to do something so foolish
duchess von teschen
you must come along my dear
we dont want to keep
the prince waiting
did you enjoy the show
it was wonderful wasnt it
it was amusing
who told you where to find me
your manager i told him if he wants
to stay in vienna you need my help
ah so im to be driven
from the city is that it
good i shall relish it
stop it
i came here to try to help you
why why should you possibly
care what happens to me now
you were my friend
i am your friend
we knew each other very briefly
a long time ago you dont know me at all
then why did you speak to me
why did you even bother talking
and you kept it all this time
i used to sit and stare
at your picture
trying to imagine where you were
at night id have dreams
i had gone with you
and then id wake up
and realize where i was
but in my dreams you
had shorter hair and no beard
where did you go when you left
to my uncles farm near prague
how exotic
i went to russia
then asia minor
and then the orient for many years
so long
i always meant to return
i just i kept thinking id find it
around the next corner
what
a real mystery
i saw remarkable things
but the only mystery
i never solved was
why my heart couldnt let go of you
he wants me to go to budapest
with him next week
to announce our engagement
he wants the hungarians behind him
theyre going to crown him king
im sure his father will have
something to say about that
he plans to overthrow his father
that could go very badly for him
and for you
you shouldnt be involved
i am part of his plan
he only gets hungary by
aligning himself with my family
leave him
its not that easy
call it off and come away with me
or dont say anything
and well just go
as long as were alive
hell hunt us
and when he finds us hell kill us
look at me
do you truly want to leave with me
yes i do
there you are as i predicted
theyve shut us down
are you happy now hmm
you made your point
it doesnt matter that we were
sold out for the whole run
no look you got it off your chest
do we have money
what
do we have any money saved
yes we have some
but we could have had
much much more
mmm it will have to do
and the second account all of it
of course herr eisenheim
thank you
and you have no doubt
it was duchess von teschen
id stake my life on it
what was in this suitcase
i dont know
hes by the first car
the map will show you where to meet
when its done youll travel ahead
with her and i shall follow
and she understands
everything this entails
completely theres not a lot of time
as you know we sometimes follow
duchess von teschen
for her protection
yesterday she was seen
in the company of another man
what man
eisenheim the illusionist
what were they doing
well they were meeting and uh
touching kissing
fornicating
not that we observed no
however i have reason to believe that
they may be planning something together
its possible they may be leaving
im not certain of anything yet
your highness
thank you inspector
we can of course acquire more information
he spent the afternoon
in vienna with his father
hes expected shortly
what a surprise
i thought you didnt like it here
i suppose you think
youre very clever
and very democratic
in your friendships
arent you
what are you talking about
your magician friend
i know youve been with him
its true weve been
friends since childhood
you sleep with all
your childhood friends
i will not be spoken to this way
youll be spoken to as i wish to speak to you
youre drunk
youre getting quite old
arent you
you know my mother was 16 years old
when she married my father
and you can you even bear children
are you any use at all
are you trying to embarrass me
it has nothing to do with you
it has everything to do with me
you will not share my bed
if youve slept with him
you dont understand
im not going to share
your bed at all
im not going to budapest with you
i dont want to be part
of what youre planning
and i will not marry you
i assume you havent been so stupid
as to tell him anything
cause if you disrupt my plans i will have
no further use for you do you understand
now you will travel
to budapest tomorrow
i recommend that you are here early
packed and ready to go
do nothing more to embarrass me
goodbye
what do you mean goodbye
come back here
come back here
dont disobey me again
whore
out of my way
please dont
no leave that
leave all the lanterns
duchess von teschen
duchess von teschen
maybe look on that side
over here
whoa whoa
i thought you saw her
get on the train with him
no sir we were waiting in vienna
for them but they left from baden
we assumed she was with him
should i wire
the crown prince in budapest
its been done
who are you
im the familys doctor
are you the chief inspector
yes i am you understand
this is a police matter now
of course i understand
good good
you have determined the cause of death
she bled to death
theres a wound on her throat
just above the left collarbone
perhaps from a knife or a sword
may i take a look
inspector ii will
not stand for it
the crown prince
will not stand for it
this is not some circus sideshow
my apologies of course
thank you doctor
probably robbed
gypsies maybe
saw all those diamonds
couldnt say no
chief inspector
theres one thing you should know
yes what is that
in the folds of her dress
i found this small gemstone
seen last thursday at 730 p m
riding without an escort
toward the imperial hunting lodge
groomsman said
she arrived about 830
what was she doing riding alone
he did this
you know he did
i know who did what
the crown prince
he killed her hes done it
before and you know it
no i dont know that in fact
im sure he didnt hes in budapest
he killed her before he left
im afraid the facts dont support your theory
she was leaving him
for who you
yes
dont be absurd herr eisenheim
he killed her because
he couldnt let her go
she knew his secret
what secret
ask your inspector he knows
stop this right now
are you completely corrupt
no not completely no
which is why ill advise you not to accuse
anyone especially his imperial highness
or you will end up in jail yourself
wheres the guard who let her out of the gate
gone with the crown prince
did any of the servants see her leave
all asleep
ahha
what about him
he uh he put her horse
in the first stall when she arrived
ah
was it this one
we dont have jurisdiction
on imperial property
thank you
i know
so what are you doing
investigating
listening to that magician are you
for all we know he did it
no i think not
the crown prince is back
chief inspector
we should go now
what have you found out
she was last seen riding here alone
yes
and based on your information
i then threw her out
did she commit suicide
no it was surely murder
do you have a suspect
we will soon your highness
later that week we arrested
a man and charged him with murder
but i knew that
that wouldnt satisfy eisenheim
i had my men continue to watch him
he finally emerged from his grief
and bought a rundown theater
its perfect
he fired his manager
and began preparing
for a new kind of show
who is he
my name is frankel
where did you come from
i come from brunn
my father is a lens grinder there
how have you come
to be here tonight
i dont know
are you alive
what can you tell us
about the other side
whats it like
yes tell us
you must know things secret things
say something spiritual
they dont seem
to think its a trick
eisenheim come out and talk to us
eisenheims audience
had always been enthusiastic
but now he was attracting a more
impassioned following
madame please
with these spirits
these manifestations
eisenheim has given us hard proof
of the souls immortality
the spirit has been reaffirmed
in the face of modern
scientific materialism
the work of spiritualism
will rouse humanity
to a new moral earnestness
it is a revolutionary movement
and we will turn the empire
into a spiritual republic
do you think eisenheims behind all this
why must i be bothered
with a magician
he is proving to be more
than a magician your highness
he is a charlatan
hes a faker
he pretends to have
supernatural powers
put him on trial for fraud
first we have to show it is fraud
then do it
find out how the trick is done
and then arrest him
this is just a rough demonstration
inspector
but you can see how it could work
yes i see
not bad not bad
we need a spy in eisenheims troupe
those orientals they wont give us anything
mm
i already tried
yeah then try something else
what has happened here
one of those ghosts from
the theater down the street
yes up there
where
there
right there and its a boy
yes look look
sick
where is this thing
right there
over there
uhhuh did you see it
mm
god an apparition i saw it i swear
yes
right over there
where are you taking him
i want to know how its done
first the orange tree now this
do i have to share all my professional
secrets with the police
well in this case yes
or ill be forced to arrest you
on what charge
oh well well start with fraud
excuse me chief inspector
what
i think you should look
outside the window
who are they
they are here for him
oh
my goodness you have
a devoted following
what is it they expect of you
i have no idea
what do your spies tell you
that you plan to subvert
the monarchy perhaps
why just because
the crown prince is a murderer
hes not a murderer
we have the real murderer in prison
he pleaded guilty
youve got the wrong man
you dont know that
no but you do
hmm
herr eisenheim you will
also go to prison
if you dont explain to me
what it is you are doing
let him go
or we will
the sentence will be greater
if that mob attacks the building
eisenheim eisenheim eisenheim
well
what are you doing
stop
stop
eisenheim
there he is
listen to me please
you must listen to me please
thank you all for coming i have been
speaking with the chief inspector
and i think theres been
a serious misunderstanding
i want you all to know
that everything that you have seen
in my theater is an illusion
its a trick
its not real
i cant bring loved ones
back from the grave
i cant receive messages
from the other side
i apologize if ive given
you any false hope
my intention has only been
to entertain nothing more
now i appreciate your support
but you must go home
please you must go
there now ive explained it
so it cant be fraud
may i go
has he tricked you
is that it
no your highness
then why are you failing me
i thought i could trust you
i thought you were a man i could bring
with me when i took the throne
am i wrong about you
no youre not wrong your highness no
i need men who can complete
the tasks assigned to them
instead im surrounded by fools
in the end i must
do everything myself
i can see this case will be no different
mm
how do i look
ordinary your highness
very ordinary
i think im going to enjoy this
they dont recognize you
good
and keep your distance i dont want
to be seen with a policeman
who are you
are you duchess von teschen
yes
whats happened to you
she was murdered
were you murdered
by who
did they arrest the right man
tell us please who murdered you
tell us
someone here
tell us and point him out
was it the crown prince
hes killed a woman before
hey the crown prince isnt even here
the crown prince
killed her something must be done
chief inspector are you sure
you have the right man
quite sure excuse me
did you investigate the crown prince
he cannot continue if this is true
he must be brought to justice
its not true
the magic trick is not evidence
what is your name
i dont see how that matters
i advise you to watch what you say sir
that actress didnt even
look like sophie
but the audience is
stupid and he knows it
he manipulates them
he himself said nothing
his actress said nothing
inflammatory
he left it to the audience
to make their accusations
all plants paid for
by him of course
i dont suppose you made
a note of those people
im afraid we didnt
have enough men tonight
at the next performance
i want them all arrested
every one of them
eisenheim the whole troupe
i want to have an example
made of him
in front of all his followers
that was very foolish last night
you cant destroy him you know
you cant bring down the monarchy
oh i know i cant
then dont raise her again
dont provoke those questions
eisenheim i dont
want to arrest you
im a cynical man god knows
but if your manifestations
are somehow real
then even im willing to admit
youre a very special person
and if its a trick
then its equally impressive
either way you have a gift
so dont make me put you in jail
promise me you wont do it again
i promise you youll
enjoy this next show
what do you want
nothing
then why bring her back
just to be with her
to be with her
everything is ready
yes sir
were trying to assess how he might escape
he will not escape
i want guards at every door and window
sir
i want to apologize to you
for my behavior of late
but i want to make it up to you
if youll listen to a proposition
well i dont know
ill make it worth your while josef
you know im very busy right now i havent
just been sitting around waiting for you
no no of course
i want you to assume control
of all my finances
and my assets
everything
everything
yes including this theater
and all the receipts from
tonights performance
which i offer with
my sincere thanks
what do you say
all right
ill do it
good good
would you like me
to introduce you tonight
no tonight just enjoy the show
excuse me chief inspector
im josef fischer eisenheims manager
yes i remember
whats going on why all the police
precautions herr fischer
precautions
are you planning to arrest eisenheim
oh thats entirely up to him
there there
its duchess von teschen
why were you murdered
i was leaving him
leaving who
the crown prince
of course it was
we wont stand for it
i tried to get away
i was wearing my locket when i died
but now its gone
its lost
tell us please who murdered you
was it the crown prince
we must do something
come along
we must help her
to the front
step out
in the name of
his imperial majesty
and the city of vienna
i hereby arrest eduard abramovicz
also known as
eisenheim the illusionist
on charges of
disturbing public order
charlatanism and
threats against the empire
no
get back get back
stop it stop it all of you
he disappeared
where is he
find him
where is he
he was right there
how was his trick done
no trick
how is it done
i dont know nobody know
damn it
i had my driver take
the sword to police headquarters
my men will examine it and see
if it matches the gemstone
found on duchess von teschens body
i have no doubt that it will
and after that i came in here
and you asked me why i was late
youve stolen imperial property
that seems trivial
compared with murder
even if that were true you have
no jurisdiction here
thats right you may do as you wish here
without consequence
nobody can punish you
except one man
whos that
the emperor
i dont suppose hell leave his crown
to a murderer do you
hell never believe you
maybe not
hmm
but i wrote a letter
to his general staff
telling them everything
including your plan
to overthrow the emperor
i know theyll listen to that
youll not take the throne
not with my help
you no longer want to be chief of police
mayor of vienna
you dont want to be
a baron an aristocrat
im afraid thats out of
the question at this point
you fool
hes tricking you
hes manipulating you he had the sword
at a command performance
he could have pried the stones loose then
and planted them here
he has planted everything
youre drunk
its all a trick
its an illusion
perhaps theres truth
in this illusion
you need to wire your driver
and have the sword returned
or what
ill shoot you perhaps ill shoot you anyway
and then youll have killed
a police inspector and a duchess
or perhaps youll kill yourself
you uh committed suicide
distraught at having failed your leader
ah some officers
of the general staff id guess
they must have received my letter
what do you want
i dont want anything
fine fine you shall have nothing
gentlemen
the situation is so obvious
everyones completely incompetent
my father runs the empire
into the ground
and no one notices no one
knows anything about it
i propose to clean up
the mess and you betray me
youre all becoming irrelevant
you will be replaced
the country will be run by mongrels
theres a thousand different voices screaming
to be heard and nothing will be done
nothing
ive done everything i can
too much
far too much
your highness
are you in there
your highness open the door
please open the door
by your fathers authority
i insist you open the door
you must open the door
youre all fools
please your highness
i cant stand it
i wont stand it
break down the door break it down
what happened
the crown prince just shot himself
are you chief inspector uhl
i used to be
you
who gave you this
who gave you this
herr eisenheim
when
look out
all aboard
tickets and papers
all aboard
when its done
youll travel ahead
with her and i will follow
and she understands everything this entails
completely
do you think that
eisenheims behind all this
so what does it mean to die
what do you want
to be with her
to be with her
chief inspector
theres one thing you should know
your sword
is very beautiful might i see it
youre drunk
you were drunk
