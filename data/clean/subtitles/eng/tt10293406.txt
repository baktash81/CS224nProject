that saddle belonged to bronco henry 
greatest rider i ever knew

from the lewis and clark expedition 
they were real men in those days 
let s say just you and me
go out for a couple of days 
find those trails
and follow them to the end 
wouldn t be surprised if there were gold
or precious minerals in them there rocks

in ways that other people can t 
take that hill over there 
most people look at it
and just see a hill 
where bronco looked at it 
what do you suppose he saw 
a barking dog

i felt a chill in my spine when i heard
the chalk squeak on a blackboard 
oh  miss   chuckling 
mrs  merchant  that s who it was 
she  she drew chalk stars
by our names on the blackboard 
i wonder why it was stars she gave us 
why not diamonds  why not hearts 
why not spades   laughs  why 
i wonder why it was always stars 
because stars are supposed
to be unreachable 
 chuckles softly 
yes 
but they weren t unreachable
because she gave them to us 
  and  peter 
   peter  hmm 
we had this valentine box 
and it was covered with white crepe paper 
and we would paste big  red hearts on it 
lopsided hearts   chuckles 
and you had a great many valentines 
a great many 
 sighs 
because you re beautiful 
is there a sound that makes you shiver 
 running thumb over comb
