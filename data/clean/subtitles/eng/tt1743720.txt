martin lindstrom believes hes unlocked secret
creating memorable one time
trailers produced los angeles based neuromarketing
trailer deadly important survival movie
create best scene
find emotional peak
highs lows
create engaging story people see
thats exactly whats happening
theyre typically testing five different trailers movies
larger movies figuring one emotionally engaging
one creating curiosity
science fiction movie one creating fear forth
whole thing sounds bit crazy
neuromarketing evil
like anything else
end day people abusing
reason fantastic dare go
experiment like show really goes

theres way could explain
interviewing watching commercial right
yeah way
think stuff like
youre manipulating consumers make choice
lets get one thing right advertising concept manipulation
dont fooled go retail store
think youre safe thats point youre volatile
youre vulnerable whole process
able go dont see one bit advertising
sleep
thats coming affords limits
thats nature commercial instinct
doesnt know boundaries doesnt know limits
goes areas taboo
like commercializing childhood
corporations raising children
mcdonalds feeds disney time warner entertains
