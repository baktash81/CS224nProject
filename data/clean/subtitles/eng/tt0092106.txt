kranix  ahh 
it is the year 2005 
the treacherous decepticons
have conquered the autobots 
home planet of cybertron 
but from secret staging grounds
on two of cybertron s moons
the valiant autobots prepare
to retake their homeland 
ironhide  report to me at once 
every time i look into
a monitor  prime 
my circuits sizzle 
when are we gonna
start busting decepti chops 
i want you to make a special run
to autobot city on earth 
  but  prime  
  listen  ironhide 
we don t have enough
energon cubes
to power a full scale assault 
ready the shuttle for launch 
your days are numbered now 
decepti creeps 
jazz  report security status 
no sign of decepticons here 
prime 
what about moonbase two 
jazz to moonbase two 
jazz to moonbase two 
bumblebee and spike here 
we re about to
send up a shuttle 
any decepticon shenanigans
in your area 
all clear  jazz 
hey  ironhide  tell my son 
daniel  i miss him 
and tell him not to worry 
i ll be coming home as soon as
we ve kicked megatron s tail
across the galaxy 
will do  spike 
cliffjumper 
commence countdown 
five  four  three 
two  one 
blastoff 
now  all we need is a little
energon and a lot of luck 
laserbeak returns  megatron 
welcome  laserbeak 
unlike some of my other warriors
you never fail me 
soundwave  play back
laserbeak s findings 
as you command  megatron 
i want you to make a special run
to autobot city on earth 
  but  prime  
  listen  ironhide 
we don t have enough
energon cubes
to power a full scale assault 
ready the shuttle for launch 
now  all we need is a little
energon and a lot of luck 
more than you imagine 
optimus prime 
megatron 
decepticons 
die  autobots 
this was almost too easy 
starscream 
much easier  almighty megatron 
than attacking the real threat  
the autobots  moonbase 
you re an idiot  starscream
when we slip by their early
warning systems
in their own shuttle
and destroy autobot city
the autobots
will be vanquished forever 
no 
such heroic nonsense 
fish are jumping today 
huh  danno 
  i guess so 
  hey  what s the matter 
oh  i don t know  hotrod 
come on  you can tell me 
i guess i just miss my dad 
don t worry 
spike ll be back soon 
oh  hey  i got something

hurry or we ll miss it 
if you re gonna ride  danno 
ride in style 
let s stop here 
why settle for a peek  daniel 
when you can see everything
from lookout mountain 
a little to the left 
a little bit more 
turbo revvin  young punk  
i ll straighten you out yet 
hotrod  look 
there s a hole in the shuttle 
what  
decepticons 
what s that darn fool doing

huh  not bad for an old timer 
 old timer  
that s something you ll never be
if you don t get
back to the city 
save it  kup 
let s burn rubber 
ultra magnus 
a cursory evaluation
of decepticon capability
indicates a distinct
tactical deficiency 
in other words  perceptor 
we re outnumbered 
springer  you and arcee
transform autobot city 
perceptor  tell blaster to radio
prime for reinforcements 
what about me  magnus 
what about me  huh  huh  huh 
i can help  i wanna help 
what about me 
blurr  you can help me
alert the others 
absolutely positively
definitely 
nobody can get the job done
faster than i can  nobody 
come on  arcee  let s go 
but hotrod and kup
are still outside the city 
we can t wait 
they ll have to take care
of themselves  come on 
pathetic fools 
there s no escape 
oh 
ah  my foot 
breach their defenses 
mm  delicious  eh  scrapmate 
er  a little heavy
on the electrons  electron 
the insecticons
are in our way 
wrong 
they re our way in 
yah 
look out and shout  ow 
hey  perceptor  what s shaking
  other than this fortress 
blaster  ultra magnus
sends orders
to contact optimus prime
on moonbase one 
all right 
cover your receptors  perceptor 
optimus prime  do you read me 
the decepticons
are blitzing autobot city 
we re really taking a pounding 
don t know how much longer
we can hold out 
soundwave 
jam that transmission 
rumble  frenzy  ravage  ratbat  
eject  operation  interference 
optimus prime 
do you read me 
the decepticons are blitzing
autobot city 
we re really taking   
first we crack the shell 
then we crack the nuts inside 
hey  run  blaster 
save yourself 
no way  two can play 
sic  em 
do you think
you got through to prime 
let s hope so  cos if i didn t
we re all gonna look like
burnt out toaster ovens 
we ve got decepticons at the
gates  decepticons in the air 
decepticons inside the
walls  decepticons  decepticons 
if we beat them at the walls
they re still in the air 
so where does that leave us 
nowhere  that s where 
come on  arcee  we gotta get
this launcher into place 
megatron s making his big push
and we gotta push back 
keep at it  springer  my boy 
help s to hand 
together now 
i was afraid you d be trapped
outside the city 
unh  hey  i wasn t worried
for a microsecond 
then you probably didn t
understand the situation 
that did it 
constructicons 
merge for the kill 
kup  hotrod  look 
devastator 
prepare
for extermination 
i got better things
to do tonight than die 
their defenses are
broken  let the slaughter begin 
dinobots  destroy devastator 
me  grimlock  love challenge 
dinobots transform 
megatron must be stopped   
no matter the cost 
prime 
one shall stand  one shall fall 
why throw away your life
so recklessly 
that s a question you should
ask yourself  megatron 
no  i ll crush you
with my bare hands 
i ve got to help prime 
stay away  lad 
that s prime s fight 
i ll rip out your optics 
finish him off  prime 
do it now 
no more  optimus prime 
grant me mercy  i beg of you 
you  who are without mercy 
now plead for it 
i thought you were
made of sterner stuff 
no  you don t  megatron 
out of the way  hotrod 
fall  fall 
i would ve waited
an eternity for this
it s over  prime 
never 
optimus    forgive me 
how do you feel 
mighty megatron 
yah 
astrotrain  transform
and get us out of here 
don t leave me  soundwave 
as you command  megatron 
the decepticons are retreating 
prime did it 
he turned the tide 
astrotrain  take off 
i fear the wounds are fatal 
prime  you can t die 
do not grieve 
soon i shall be
one with the matrix 
prime   
ultra magnus 
it    it is to you  old friend   
i shall pass
the matrix of leadership
as it was passed to me 
but  prime 
i am    just a soldier  i   
i m not worthy 
nor was i 
but one day an autobot
shall rise from our ranks
and use the power of the matrix
to light    our darkest hour 
until that day   
till all are one   
jettison some weight or i ll
never make it to cybertron 
fellow decepticons 
astrotrain has requested
that we lighten our burden 
in that case i say it is
survival of the fittest 
do i hear a second on that 
aye 
and against 
nay 
the ayes have it 
  get  make room for others 
  don t 
oh  how it pains me to do this 
wait   
i still function 
wanna bet 
starscream 
well  as megatron has 
how shall we say  departed 
i nominate myself
as the new leader 
wait  the constructicons
formed devastator 
the most powerful robot 
we should rule 
soundwave superior 
constructicons inferior 
who are you calling inferior  
nobody would follow an
uncharismatic bore like you 
hey  nobody calls
soundwave uncrassimatic 
yeah  let s kick tailgate 
constructicons unite 
no way 
welcome  megatron 
who    who said that 
i    am unicron 
show yourself 
i have summoned you here
for a purpose 
nobody summons megatron 
then it pleases me
to be the first 
state your business 
this is my command 
you are to destroy the
autobot matrix of leadership 
it is the one thing 
the only thing 
that can stand in my way 
you have nothing to fear 
i have already crushed optimus
prime with my bare hands 
you exaggerate 
the point is  he s dead 
and the matrix died with him 
no  the point is you are a fool 
the matrix has been passed
to their new leader 
ultra magnus 
  destroy it for me 
  why should i 
what s in it for me 
your bargaining posture
is highly dubious 
very well  i will
provide you with a new body
and new troops to command 
  and 
  and nothing 
you belong to me now 
i belong to nobody 
perhaps i misjudged you 
proceed   
on your way to oblivion 
ah  no  no 
i accept your terms  i accept 
ah 
excellent 
behold    galvatron 
and these shall be your minions 
scourge  the tracker 
and his huntsmen   the sweeps 
cyclonus
the warrior and his armada 
and this shall be your ship 
now go 
destroy the autobot matrix 
i will rip open ultra magnus
and every other autobot
until the matrix
has been destroyed 
to cybertron 
destroy the matrix 
get on with the ceremony 
my fellow decepticons
as your new leader  i   
who disrupts my coronation  
 coronation   starscream 
this is bad comedy 
megatron  is that you 
here s a hint 
will anyone else
attempt to fill his shoes 
what did he say his name was 
galvatron 
long live galvatron 
galvatron 
where d that come from 
who cares  i m more worried
about where it s going 
talk to me  earth 
we got a situation out here 
roger me  wilco me  anything 
hello  hello  earth 
i m picking up a faint signal 
this is jazz  a ginormous 
weird looking planet
just showed up
in the suburbs of cybertron 
and it s
attacking moonbase one 
jazz  cliffjumper 
got to blast free  if we can 
ignition and    hit it 
jazz  we re not getting away 
this is spike and bumblebee
up here on moonbase two 
this thing    this monster planet
just ripped
the first moon to shreds
and it s heading this way 
we ll try and slow it down 
but you d better get here fast
because we re not gonna   
dad 
bumblebee 
activate the explosives 
if this doesn t stop it 
nothing will 
the explosives are activated 
let s get out of here 
hurry 
it s gonna blow 
  hooray  we ve done it 
  we did it 
way to go 
  look 
  it isn t even dented 
oh  shit 
what are we gonna do now 
we re being
sucked into it 
how dare unicron  cybertron
and all its moons belong to me 
remember  we belong to him 
i belong to nobody 
i will obey    unicron 
decepticons  to earth 
autobots  prepare to
board the shuttles 
this new menace
is more dangerous
than all the decepticons
put together 
somehow we must destroy it
before it devours cybertron 
but what about my dad 
he s on the moon between that
monster planet and cybertron 
daniel  we ll do everything
we can for spike 
and what are we gonna do
when we get there 
if that thing crunches moons
it ll make short work of us 
maybe the matrix can stop it 
you re right  it can 
what do you know about it  lad 
i just got this feeling 
look 
to the shuttles 
i  galvatron  will crush you
just as megatron crushed prime 
and you ll die trying 
just like megatron 
uh  autobot scrap 
do you want me
to gut ultra magnus 
there are plenty of autobots
for you  ultra magnus is mine 
stay close to me  daniel 
and you better stay close to me 
no  you d better
stay close to me 
nice dino  good dino

kup  hotrod  you guys

of the battle on alpha 9 
the petrorabbits were   
grimlock  get your noodle
out of my face

love kup s war stories 
you re living one now 
engage the boosters 
for cybertron s sake

you re gonna walk home 
hurry

arcee s still out there 
jump 
thanks 
that was close 
believe it or not 
this is the fun part 
congratulations 
autobots  we ve lost them 
so rest while you can 
yep  i remember 
the dust was so thick on beta 4
you had to use windshield wipers
on your optic sensors 
me grimlock
know all about wipers 
want to hear good part of story 
good part  kup 
tell swoop good part 
ok  ok 
well  the dust was really thick 
and then this gigantic icthyac
came tromping and stomping
down the mountain 
flames spewing out
of its nostrils 
and i thought for sure   
hey  kup  don t you think we
have better things to do now
than tell old stories 
like what 
like maybe figure out
how we re gonna
rescue our friends
and then save cybertron 
no  tell story 
  shh 
  quiet 
we want to hear story 
  grr 
  time out  time out  time out 
they re closing on us 
yep  like the shrikebats
of dromedon 
  how d you beat them 
  i m trying to remember 
there were an awful lot
of casualties that day 
oh  yeah  
we inverted polarities 
they re coming back 
all right  we survived that 
yeah  but will we survive this 
cyclonus 
transform and attack 
i can t control it 
we re gonna crash 
kup and hotrod just bought it 
i can t deal with that now 
face it  magnus 
the decepticons are gonna dog us
until they see us dead 
then that s exactly
what they re gonna see 
prepare for
emergency separation 
  that s too dangerous 
  what choice do we have 
the autobots
have been terminated 
excellent 
and the matrix with them 
unicron 
why   take me to unicron 
take me now 
ah 
did we have to let them detonate
three quarters of the ship 
seeing as how they would have
detonated four quarters 
i think it was a good choice 
but how are we gonna get there
in this wreck 
perceptor  can you locate
a place to set down for repairs 
gamma waves
in this sector of space
create marginal navigation
probabilities  however   
ahem    yes  i believe i can
