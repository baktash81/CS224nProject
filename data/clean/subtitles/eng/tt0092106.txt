kranix ahh
it is the year 2005
the treacherous decepticons
have conquered the autobots
home planet of cybertron
but from secret staging grounds
on two of cybertrons moons
the valiant autobots prepare
to retake their homeland
ironhide report to me at once
every time i look into
a monitor prime
my circuits sizzle
when are we gonna
start busting deceptichops
i want you to make a special run
to autobot city on earth
but prime
listen ironhide
we dont have enough
energon cubes
to power a fullscale assault
ready the shuttle for launch
your days are numbered now
decepticreeps
jazz report security status
no sign of decepticons here
prime
what about moonbase two
jazz to moonbase two

send up a shuttle
any decepticon shenanigans

energon and a lot of luck
laserbeak returns megatron

laserbeaks findings
as you command megatron
i want you to make a special run
to autobot city on earth
but prime
listen ironhide

energon cubes
to power a fullscale assault
ready the shuttle for launch
now all we need is a little
energon and a lot of luck
more than you imagine
optimus prime
megatron
decepticons
die autobots
this was almost too easy
starscream
much easier almighty megatron
than attacking the real threat
the autobots moonbase
youre an idiot starscream
when we slip by their early
warning systems
in their own shuttle
and destroy autobot city
the autobots
will be vanquished forever
no

fish are jumping today

oldtimer
thats something youll never be
if you dont get
back to the city

ultra magnus
a cursory evaluation
of decepticon capability
indicates a distinct
tactical deficiency
in other words perceptor
were outnumbered
springer you and arcee

perceptor tell blaster to radio
prime for reinforcements
what about me magnus
what about me huh huh huh
i can help i wanna help

of themselves come on
pathetic fools
theres no escape

first we crack the shell
then we crack the nuts inside
hey run blaster

no way two can play
sic em
do you think
you got through to prime
lets hope so cos if i didnt
were all gonna look like
burntout toaster ovens
weve got decepticons at the
gates decepticons in the air
decepticons inside the
walls decepticons decepticons
if we beat them at the walls
theyre still in the air
so where does that leave us
nowhere thats where
come on arcee we gotta get
this launcher into place
megatrons making his big push
and we gotta push back
keep at it springer my boy
helps to hand
together now
i was afraid youd be trapped
outside the city
unh hey i wasnt worried
for a microsecond
then you probably didnt
understand the situation
that did it
constructicons
merge for the kill
kup hotrod look
devastator
prepare
for extermination
i got better things
to do tonight than die
their defenses are
broken let the slaughter begin
dinobots destroy devastator
me grimlock love challenge
dinobots transform
megatron must be stopped
no matter the cost
prime
one shall stand one shall fall
why throw away your life
so recklessly
thats a question you should
ask yourself megatron
no ill crush you
with my bare hands
ive got to help prime
stay away lad
thats primes fight
ill rip out your optics
finish him off prime
do it now
no more optimus prime
grant me mercy i beg of you
you who are without mercy
now plead for it
i thought you were
made of sterner stuff
no you dont megatron
out of the way hotrod
fall fall
i wouldve waited
an eternity for this
its over prime
never
optimus forgive me
how do you feel
mighty megatron
yah
astrotrain transform
and get us out of here
dont leave me soundwave
as you command megatron
the decepticons are retreating
prime did it
he turned the tide
astrotrain take off
i fear the wounds are fatal
prime you cant die
do not grieve
soon i shall be
one with the matrix
prime
ultra magnus
it it is to you old friend
i shall pass
the matrix of leadership
as it was passed to me
but prime
i am just a soldier i
im not worthy
nor was i
but one day an autobot
shall rise from our ranks
and use the power of the matrix
to light our darkest hour
until that day
till all are one
jettison some weight or ill
never make it to cybertron
fellow decepticons
astrotrain has requested
that we lighten our burden
in that case i say it is
survival of the fittest
do i hear a second on that
aye
and against
nay
the ayes have it
get make room for others
dont
oh how it pains me to do this
wait
i still function
wanna bet
starscream
well as megatron has
how shall we say departed
i nominate myself
as the new leader
wait the constructicons
formed devastator
the most powerful robot
we should rule
soundwave superior
constructicons inferior
who are you calling inferior
nobody would follow an
uncharismatic bore like you
hey nobody calls
soundwave uncrassimatic
yeah lets kick tailgate
constructicons unite
no way
welcome megatron
who who said that
i am unicron
show yourself
i have summoned you here
for a purpose
nobody summons megatron
then it pleases me
to be the first
state your business
this is my command
you are to destroy the
autobot matrix of leadership
it is the one thing
the only thing
that can stand in my way
you have nothing to fear
i have already crushed optimus
prime with my bare hands
you exaggerate
the point is hes dead
and the matrix died with him
no the point is you are a fool
the matrix has been passed
to their new leader
ultra magnus
destroy it for me
why should i
whats in it for me
your bargaining posture
is highly dubious
very well i will
provide you with a new body
and new troops to command
and
and nothing
you belong to me now
i belong to nobody
perhaps i misjudged you
proceed
on your way to oblivion
ah no no
i accept your terms i accept
ah
excellent
behold galvatron
and these shall be your minions
scourge the tracker
and his huntsmen the sweeps
cyclonus
the warrior and his armada
and this shall be your ship
now go
destroy the autobot matrix
i will rip open ultra magnus
and every other autobot
until the matrix
has been destroyed
to cybertron
destroy the matrix
get on with the ceremony
my fellow decepticons
as your new leader i
who disrupts my coronation
coronation starscream
this is bad comedy
megatron is that you
heres a hint
will anyone else
attempt to fill his shoes
what did he say his name was
galvatron
long live galvatron
galvatron
whered that come from
who cares im more worried
about where its going
talk to me earth
we got a situation out here
roger me wilco me anything
hello hello earth
im picking up a faint signal
this is jazz a ginormous
weirdlooking planet
just showed up
in the suburbs of cybertron
and its
attacking moonbase one
jazz cliffjumper
got to blast free if we can
ignition and hit it
jazz were not getting away
this is spike and bumblebee
up here on moonbase two
this thing this monster planet
just ripped
the first moon to shreds
and its heading this way
well try and slow it down
but youd better get here fast
because were not gonna

bumblebee
activate the explosives
if this doesnt stop it
nothing will
the explosives are activated
lets get out of here
hurry
its gonna blow
hooray weve done it
we did it
way to go
look

oh shit
what are we gonna do now
were being
sucked into it
how dare unicron cybertron
and all its moons belong to me
remember we belong to him
i belong to nobody
i will obey unicron
decepticons to earth
autobots prepare to
board the shuttles
this new menace
is more dangerous
than all the decepticons
put together
somehow we must destroy it
before it devours cybertron
but what about my dad
hes on the moon between that
monster planet and cybertron
daniel well do everything
we can for spike
and what are we gonna do
when we get there
if that thing crunches moons
itll make short work of us
maybe the matrix can stop it
youre right it can
what do you know about it lad
i just got this feeling
look
to the shuttles
i galvatron will crush you
just as megatron crushed prime
and youll die trying
just like megatron
uh autobot scrap
do you want me
to gut ultra magnus
there are plenty of autobots
for you ultra magnus is mine

congratulations
autobots weve lost them
so rest while you can
yep i remember
the dust was so thick on beta 4
you had to use windshield wipers
on your optic sensors
me grimlock
know all about wipers
want to hear good part of story
good part kup
tell swoop good part
ok ok
well the dust was really thick
and then this gigantic icthyac
came tromping and stomping
down the mountain
flames spewing out
of its nostrils
and i thought for sure
hey kup dont you think we
have better things to do now
than tell old stories
like what
like maybe figure out
how were gonna
rescue our friends
and then save cybertron
no tell story
shh
quiet
we want to hear story
grr
timeout timeout timeout
theyre closing on us
yep like the shrikebats
of dromedon
howd you beat them
im trying to remember
there were an awful lot
of casualties that day
oh yeah
we inverted polarities
theyre coming back
all right we survived that
yeah but will we survive this
cyclonus
transform and attack
i cant control it
were gonna crash
kup and hotrod just bought it
i cant deal with that now
face it magnus
the decepticons are gonna dog us
until they see us dead

what theyre gonna see
prepare for
emergency separation
thats too dangerous
what choice do we have
the autobots
have been terminated
excellent
and the matrix with them
unicron
why take me to unicron
take me now
ah
did we have to let them detonate
threequarters of the ship
seeing as how they would have
detonated fourquarters
i think it was a good choice
but how are we gonna get there
in this wreck
perceptor can you locate
a place to set down for repairs
