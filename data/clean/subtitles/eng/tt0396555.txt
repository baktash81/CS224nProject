    subs4u gr  
then i didn t choose that one
because it was gonna give me pimples 
so i choosed another scary one
because  for all those years
that i went for halloween 
i wasn t scary at all 
i love baseball 
it s my destiny to play that game 
i don t really care about winning 
well  like  now i do
 cause  like  we ve lost every game 
i ve gotten tired of it 
i m working  like  so hard 
all the balls are getting thrown to me 
i m trying to catch  like  every one 
all of the people in the outfield
are all looking around and   
come on 
let s play some baseball  okay 
not the lazy game 
they re here 
lewis 
lewis 
goob  hey  i did it  goob  i finished it 
they are gonna love this 
nothing says  adopt me 
like a weird invention 
lewis 
  lewis  the harringtons are here 
  way ahead of you  mildred 
wait  wait  wait  wait  wait 
remember  sit up straight 
look them in the eye 
smile  let s fix your   
mildred 
all right  all right  all right  all right 
go show them how special you are 
oh  i hope this is it 
i hope he gets adopted 
you and me both  chief 
i mean  there s so many things
in the world that can be improved 
just think of it 
moving sidewalks  flying cars 
the possibilities are endless 
flying cars  yeah  that s a good one 
all it takes is some imagination
and a little science 
and we can make the world
a better place 
well  these are all interesting ideas 
so  what s your favourite sport 
  well  does inventing count as a sport 
  actually   
 cause i think i hit a home run
with this one 
  what is that 
  first  a question 
what s the number one problem
that you face
when you make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
  lewis  i don t think we   
  portion control 
too much peanut butter sticks
to the roof of your mouth 
takes forever to chew 
too much jelly squishes out the sides
and makes your hands all sticky 
well  i propose
that the perfect p b  and j 
is within mankind s grasp 
and i ve built this machine to achieve it 
for this demonstration 
i ll use regular bread 
honey  it s okay 
as you can see  toasting is an option 
we don t usually eat peanut butter 
lewis  this is really not necessary 
it s jammed 
lewis  please  don t 
what s happening 
mr harrington has a peanut allergy 
i m sorry 
here let me help you get that off 
stand back 
  is he gonna be okay 
  breathe  breathe 
i m so sorry  i didn t know 
it was really nice to meet you 
we re gonna need some time
to think about it 
hi  folks  everything all   
what happened 
miss duffy 
that boy is definitely not right for us 
now  if you ll excuse me 
i m so sorry about this 
if you would just   
  i made some lunch 
  not hungry 
poor mr harrington 
  i killed him 
  no  no  no  you didn t kill him 
i called  he s perfectly fine 
i was just gonna say that it s   
it s too bad
he didn t get to try a sandwich
from that wonderful invention of yours 
  yeah  real wonderful 
  it s not you 
we just haven t found
the right couple yet 
one hundred twenty four 
what 
that s how many adoption interviews
i ve had  124 
oh  lewis  come on  now 
you re exaggerating just to make your
point 
plus  i m gonna be 13 next year 
and you know how hard it is
for a teenager to get adopted 
i have no future  no one wants me 
that s not true  lewis 
my own mother didn t even want me 
now  stop it  you do not know that 
then why d she give me up 
she may not have been able
to take care of you 
did you ever think of that 
i am sure that she was only thinking
about what was best for you 
i never thought of it that way 
maybe she wanted to keep you 
but she had no choice 
you re right 
my real mom is the only person
who s ever wanted me 
wait  i said  maybe   
and if she wanted me then 
she ll want me now 
what are you talking about 
i have to find her  mildred 
and when i do  she ll take me back 
and we ll be a family again 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
lewis  you can t do that 
no one knows anything about her 
no one even saw her 
wrong  i saw her
once 
she s in here  i just have to remember 
that s it 
hello
i got something to tell you
but it s crazy
i got something to show you
so give me just one more chance
one more glance
and i will make of you
another believer
guess what 
you got more than you bargained
ain t it crazy 
you got more than you paid for
so give me just one more chance
one more glance
one more hand to hold
you ve been on my mind
though it may seem i m fooling
wasted so much time
though it may seem i m fooling
what are we gonna do 
what are we gonna do 
what are we gonna do about it 
you ve been on my mind
one more chance
wasted so much time
one more chance
so tired 
we ll see you at 2 00 this afternoon 
he ll be so excited you re coming 
bye bye  now 
yes  hey  goob    i mean  michael 
  good luck at the big game today 
  easy win 
those guys are a bunch of bums 
i just hope i can stay awake 
don t tell me  let me guess 
he was up all night
working on his stupid project 
but that s what happens
when you get a science geek
for a roommate 
ah  that s good joe 
all right  einstein 
you owe michael big time 
well  unlocking the secrets of the brain
took a lot longer than i expected 
but it s finished  mildred 
i recalibrated the headset 
now the neural circuits will connect 
i ve cracked the hippocampus 
really  okay  what 
now to test it out 
oh  no  i m late  i gotta go 
wait a minute  lewis  wait a minute 
i almost forgot what i came up here for 
i know you have a lot
on your plate today 
but i ve scheduled an interview for you
this afternoon 
  no  thanks 
   no  thanks  
sweetheart  this is
about being adopted 
and you will be back here
clean  happy and on time 
i m done with interviews  mildred 
i m not gonna be rejected anymore 
listen  i know where your head is 
but i m telling you 
you have got to get out of the past
and look to the future 
i am  and this is it 
this is my future 
i m sorry 
lewis  honey 
dr krunklehorn 
i know you re very busy there
at inventco labs 
and we re just so excited
to have you as a judge 
it s my pleasure  mr willerstein 
hey  you never know 
one of your students may invent
the next integrated circuit
or microprocessor or integrated circuit 
oh  wait  i said that already 
well  i just don t get out
of that lab very much 
is that a bow tie  i like bow ties 
i haven t slept in eight days 
well  then can i get you a cot
or something 
nope  i ve got the caffeine patch 
it s my invention 
each patch is the equivalent
of 12 cups of coffee 
you can stay awake for days
with no side effects 
sorry  who s this 
this is one of our students 
stanley pukowski 
oh  so cute 
i just want to bite
his chubby little cheeks 
what s with the dress  pukowski 
it s actually a toga  sir 
coach  nice to see you  sort of 
what are you doing here 
judging a science fair 
what s it look like i m doing 
and what makes you qualified
to judge a science fair 
it s my gym 
stanley  volcano 
behold the awesome power
of mount vesuvius 
the toggle switch isn t toggling 
dr krunklehorn 
barium  cobalt  einstein  kool aid 
i don t know what she just said 
but this project is unacceptable 
now  give me 20 laps around the gym 
move it  move it  move it  go  go  go 
  coach 
  i m watching you 
okay  next up is lizzy
and her fire ant farm 
that s right 
lizzy  we talked about the fire ants 
you know that they have a tendency
to bite people 
only my enemies 
just keep moving  shall we 
top notch  lizzy 
let s not anger her
or make her jumpy in any way 
this area s not secure  get in 
have you been approached
by a tall man in a bowler hat 
  what 
  hey  hey  i ll ask the questions here 
  okay  goodbye 
  all right 
didn t want to pull rank on you 
but you forced my hand 
special agent wilbur robinson
of the t c t f 
  the what 
  time continuum task force 
  i m here to protect you 
  well   
now  tall man  bowler hat 
approached you 
no  why 
i could lose my badge for this 
he s a suspect in a robbery 
what did he steal 
  a time machine 
  a what 
i ve tracked him to this time 
and my informants say he s after you 
me  why me 
the boys back at hq
haven t figured out a motive yet 
and by  hq   i mean  headquarters   
i know what hq means 
good  you re a smart kid 
that might keep you alive  for now 
just worry
about your little science gizmo
and leave the  perp  to me 
  and by  perp   i mean   
  i know what it means 
okay  mr smarty pants 
bowler hat guy 
my frogs 
you re not gonna get away with it 
kid with science project 
dude  you almost busted
my solar system 
my frogs  they re getting away 
got you  that s the last of them 
annoying little girl 
i don t have time for this 
i m on a very important   
don t sass me  boy  i know karate 
come on  pukowski  feel the pain 
love the pain 
coach   
next up is lewis 
yes    lewis  excuse me 
lewis  tell me this thing is not gonna   
it s okay  it s gonna work this time 
i won t let you down  i promise 
all right  lewis  i trust you 
knock  em dead 
that was a figure of speech 
please don t kill anyone 
okay  stand back  everybody 
this next project
will knock your socks off 
seriously  you might wanna stand back
a little 
have you ever forgotten something 
and no matter how hard you tried 
you couldn t remember it 
well  what happens
to these forgotten memories 
i propose
they re stored somewhere in your brain 
and i built a machine
that can retrieve them 
i call it the memory scanner 
it s shiny 
so  lewis 
how does the memory scanner work 
first  you input the desired period
of time on this keypad 
then a laser scans the cerebral cortex 
where memories are stored 
the retrieved memory
is then displayed on this monitor 
wrap him up  i ll take two 
now  i m going back 12 years 
three months and 11 days 
why that particular day 
you didn t think
i was paying attention  did you 
well  that was the day   
let s just say  that was
a very important day in my life 
fair enough  play ball 
it ll just take a second
to get the turbines going 
lewis  wait 
she s gonna blow 
watch out 
feel the pain  love the   
hurts so much  make it stop 
make it stop 
coach  suck it up  okay 
let us conduct ourselves in a way
that we ll all be proud of tomorrow 
  let s calm down 
  mr willerstein 
  i didn t mean to   
  not now  lewis 
i m sorry  i m so sorry 
not now 
okay  and we are walking
in a calm  orderly fashion
toward the exits 
wait  lewis 
come  my dear  our future awaits 
hey  what are you doing up here 
would you quit that  please 
i know you re not a pigeon 
you re blowing my cover 
we re the only ones up here 
that s just what they want you to think 
now  enough moping 
take this back to the science fair
and fix that memory scanner 
stop  stop  get away from me 
maybe you ve forgotten 
i m a time cop from the future 
should be taken very seriously 
that s no badge 
this is a coupon for a tanning salon 
you re a fake 
okay  you got me  i m not a cop 
but i really am from the future 
and there really is this bowler hat guy 
here we go again 
he stole a time machine 
came to the science fair
and ruined your project 
my project didn t work
because i m no good 
there is no bowler hat guy 
there is no time machine 
and you re not from the future 
you re crazy 
i am not crazy 
oh  yeah  captain time travel 
prove it 
yeah  that s what i thought 
i m just gonna go lock myself
in my room
and hide under the covers
for a couple years 
if i prove to you i m from the future 
will you go back to the science fair 
yeah  sure  whatever you say 
hey  let go of me 
  what are you doing  let go of me 
  okay 
what is this  where are we going 
to the future 
the future has arrived
the future has arrived today
the future has arrived
the future has arrived today
is this proof enough for you 
is it ever 
i never thought that time travel
could be possible in my lifetime 
and here it is  right in front of me 
the truth will set you free  brother 
this is beyond anything
i could ve imagined 
this means
i could really change my life 
that s right  you can 
next stop  science fair 
to fix your memory scanner 
hey  i m not gonna fix
that stupid memory scanner 
  what 
  wilbur  this is a time machine 
why should i fix my dumb invention
when you can take me
to see my mom now in this ship 
i could actually go back to that night
and stop her from giving me up 
the answer is not a time machine 
it s this 
this  you want to know
what i think about this 
what are you doing 
i m sorry  wilbur 
but you don t know
what i ve lived through 
  lewis  no 
  let go 
  you let go 
  you re not the boss of me 
yes  i am   cause you re 12  and i m 13 
that makes me older 
well  i was born in the past 
which makes me older
and the boss of you 
i am so dead 
i m not allowed to look at this thing 
let alone drive it 
mom and dad are gonna kill me 
and i can tell you this 
it will not be done with mercy 
isn t there like
a time machine repair shop
  or something 
  no 
there s only two time machines
in existence 
and the bowler hat guy
has the other one 
well  somebody s gonna have
to fix this 
good idea  you re smart  you fix it 
are you crazy  i can t fix this thing 
yes  you can  you broke it  you fix it 
all right  under one condition 
i fix it 
you take me back to see my mom 
what  you didn t even follow through
on our last deal 
how can i trust you 
well  you told me you were a time cop
from the future 
how can i trust you 
touché 
so do we have a deal 
good day  madam 
  i m here to change the future 
  yes  sir 
i must speak with the man
in charge immediately 
  yes  sir 
  i have an appointment with destiny 
very good  sir  i ll let smith know 
and i ll have your dry cleaning
delivered directly to your suite 
  what 
  now  what time is your appointment 
  are you talking to me 
  yes 
what time is your appointment 
big hand is on the    oh  2 00 
you re the 2 00 
yes  yes  i am 
you re mary johnson 
yes 
mary is short for   
marian 
  can that be a boy name 
  yes 
  then yes 
  have a seat 
oh  goody 
 pass off invention as my own    check 
oh  i love checklists 
the board is ready to see you now 
wait  what am i going to say 
i m never gonna remember that 
would you    why don t you go 
you do it so much better than me 
that s true 
a hat without a head
couldn t really pass off an invention
as its own 
fantastic  great idea 
i m so glad i have you 
 prepare to be amazed    oh  i got it 
prepare to be amazed 
 this is my invention   
 i doubt any of you have seen
anything as brilliant as this device   
very well 
miss johnson 
it s ms 
you have two minutes  please begin 
  it s shiny 
  what is that thing 
well  i like to call it my   
to call it my   
  what are you looking at 
  no  i    the sun  in my eyes 
well  then let me close the blinds 
now  the name 
well  what   
we can quibble about names
at a later date 
the point is 
what i have here is special  unique 
yes  yes  you must love it
and buy it and mass produce it 
and the best part is 
it s got really comfy headphones 
i wonder  could you lean forward
just a little bit  please 
yes  thank you 
yes  they are quite comfortable 
what do you hope
to accomplish with this 
oh  nothing of consequence 
i simply wish to crush the dreams
of a poor little orphan boy 
after that  it s all a little fuzzy 
you mean 
you haven t thought this through 
thirty seconds 
allow me to show you how it works 
first  we turn it on 
that s not it 
ten seconds 
so where do i sign 
doris  it s all over 
all our hopes and dreams dashed 
like so many pieces
of a broken machiney thing 
you re right 
success is still ours for the taking 
we must find that boy 
we ll sneak this thing into the garage 
you ll have all the tools you need 
what about your parents 
mom never goes in there 
and dad s on a business trip
until tomorrow morning 
you ve got till then to fix it 
well  fine  but i m gonna need
some blueprints or something for this 
no worries  i got someone
who could help us with that 
who dares to disturb my sanctuary 
carl  it s me  let me in 
none may enter
unless they speak the royal password 
carl  what are you talking about 
we don t have a password 
yes  we do 
i made one up while you were gone 
well  then
how am i supposed to know what it is 
you   
good point 
welcome back  little buddy 
so what s up
with the stolen time machine 
did you find it  apparently not 
and you managed
to bust this one as well 
it ll be fixed before dad gets home 
and how do you suppose
that s gonna   
  who s that 
  wow  a real robot 
hi  i m lewis 
well  that was unexpected 
as was that 
if my family finds out
i brought you from the past 
they ll bury me alive
and dance on my grave 
i m not exaggerating 
well  yes  i am  but not the point 
the point is 
your hair s a dead giveaway 
why would my hair be
a dead giveaway 
that is an excellent question 
wait  where are you going 
another excellent question 
but i don t just want to sit here 
stay 
but   
wow 
hey  ring my doorbell 
no  no  no  no  ring my doorbell 
ring it  ring it  ring it 
look at this door bell  ring it 
  yes 
  that was accidental 
that s an accidental ring 
it doesn t count 
it s in the rule book  look it up 
  flat head 
  short roots 
evergreen 
what do you mean 
don t go to the family 
how can we not go to the family
in this time of family crisis 
by leaving the garage door unlocked 
you let the time machine get stolen 
and now the entire time stream
could be altered 
that and someone took my bike 
look  i told you  it s gonna all work out 
first  we keep lewis in the garage 
away from everybody 
i show up and give him
the pep talk of the century 
then he fixes the time machine 
why is it an acorn 
i didn t have time to sculpt everything 
okay  now  the time machine is fixed 
his confidence in inventing is restored 
he goes back to the science fair 
fixes his memory scanner 
thus restoring
the space time continuum 
what about taking him back
to see his mom 
i just told him that to buy some time 
oh  yeah  can t see that one
blowing up in your face 
trust me  i got it under control 
wilbur robinson never fails 
but on the slight chance that i do   
 on the slight chance   yeah 
you know what  i ll run the numbers 
what is it 
well  it s not   
it doesn t pertain to anything in   
you know  there s not necessarily   
there s a 99 999999  chance
that you won t exist 
  what 
  and i didn t want to tell you  but i did 
i won t exist 
and where does that leave me 
alone  rusting in a corner 
what am i worried about 
now  blueprints 
if this thing ever blows over 
i really gotta get away from you
and get some quiet time 
what s   
well  hey  there  little fella 
now  i know what you re thinking 
and my clothes are not on backwards 
my head is 
oh  i used to tell that one
to my science students 
they didn t laugh  either 
anywho  what s your name  fruit head 
  well  lewis  but   
  lewis  huh 
well  say  lewis  you haven t seen
any teeth around here  have you

  franny  this is lewis 
  nice to meet you  ma am 
perfect timing 
we need someone on maracas 
where is your heart at 
nobody knows that
even though you ve him  her  me
and an army searching
i ve got a feeling
you will be reeling
when you are bad
and the circus comes to town
grandpa  i think i found your teeth 
and you see me leaving
dressed up as a magician
or something like that
sarsaparilla  my teeth are back 
ring a ding ding

pop quiz 
who have you met 
and what have you learnt 
okay  bud  fritz and joe are brothers 
fritz is married to petunia  and is she   
cranky  yes 
tallulah and laszlo are their children 
joe is married to billie 
lefty is the butler

doris  get it off  get it off 
i ve got you now 
lewis 
no  lewis is my stupid roommate 
my name s mike yagoobian 
people call me goob 
but today  everyone that beat me up
called me  puke face 
and  butterfingers 
and  booger breath   
nice to see that they re branching out 
i m sorry  i didn t mean to   
well  i was just looking for lewis 
try the roof 
he s always up there being dumb 
of course  why didn t i think of that 
mr steak  you re my only friend 
game didn t go so well  huh 
no  i fell asleep in the ninth inning 
and i missed the winning catch 
then i got beat up 
afterwards  coach took me aside
and told me to let it go 
i don t know  he s probably right 
no 
everyone will tell you to let it go
and move on  but don t 
instead  let it fester
and boil inside of you 
take these feelings
and lock them away 
let them fuel your actions 
let hate be your ally 
and you will be capable
of wonderfully horrid things 
heed my words  goob  don t let it go 
what 
where is that boy 
good idea 
separate and look for clues 
look  my dear  look what i found 
it s a stick 
now  what did you find 
yes  yes  i see 
time travel residue next to dna
from wilbur robinson 
that plus my stick must mean   
to the future  shotgun 
i don t even know what i m doing 
keep moving forward 
i mean 
this stuff is way too advanced for me 
keep moving forward 
and what if i can t fix this 
what are we gonna do 
keep moving forward 
why do you keep saying that 
and don t just say 
 keep moving forward   
it s my dad s motto 
why would his motto be
 keep moving forward  
it s what he does 
what s that supposed to mean 
that is an excellent question 
robinson industries 
the world s leading
scientific research and design factory 
my dad runs the company 
they mass produce his inventions 
his motto   keep moving forward   
it s what he does 
  what has he invented 
  everything 
carl  the time machine 
the travel tubes 
your dad invented the time machine 
yep  five years ago 
dad wakes up in the middle
of the night in a cold sweat 
he wants to build a time machine 
so he starts working 
we re talking plans 
we re talking scale models 
we re talking prototypes 
that s a prototype 
  the very first  or what s left of it 
  yikes 
yeah  dark day at the robinson house 
prototypes two and three 
not much better 
number six  58 
212  485 
952 
and they all end the same way 
but he doesn t give up 
dude  i can t take you seriously
in that hat 
he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it 
the first working time machine 
then he keeps working and working
until finally he gets it again 
the second working time machine 
kind of small 
i m assuming that s a joke 
i m ignoring you for time reasons 
this  my friend  is merely a model
because  unfortunately 
time machine number two
is in the hands of the bowler hat guy 
  pretty amazing story  huh 
  yeah 
now  are you ready to start working 
i think that s it  i did it

lewis  lewis  wait 
i can t believe i was dumb enough
to actually believe you were my friend 
i am your friend 
mister  you re grounded till you die 
oh  yes  doris  it is a shame 
all he wants to do is go back in time
to meet the mother he never knew 
but they won t let him 
we d let him  though 
too bad
we don t have a time machine 
oh  wait  we do 
bowler hat guy 
  hello  lewis 
  what do you want 
to make your dream come true 
all you have to do is put
humpty dumpty back together again 
and we ll take you back
to find your mommy 
lewis 
let s just talk about this  lewis 
come on 
i know you re around here somewhere 
lewis 
i can t imagine why you re so interested
in this piece of junk 
that s for me to know
and you to find out 
now  show me how to work this thing 
it doesn t work  never did 
well  supposing it did 
and if one were presenting
the invention to  say 
a board of directors
for a very large invention company 
where might one find the  on  switch 
hypothetically speaking  of course 
all right  first  you turn this knob twice 
then push this red button 
and that s it  it s pretty easy 
what a stupid way to turn it on 
okay  take me to see my mom now 
yes  of course 
doris 
we had a deal 
crossies  doesn t count 
why are you doing this to me 
i never did anything to you 
you still haven t figured it out 
figured out what 
well  let s see if this rings a bell 
father of the future 
inventor extraordinaire 
 keep moving forward  
that s not me  that s wilbur s dad 
are you saying
that i m wilbur s dad 
give the boy a prize 
you grew up to be the founder
of this wretched time 
so i plan to destroy your destiny 
  easy peasy  rice and cheesy 
  well   
so if i m wilbur s dad   
keep going 
if i m wilbur s dad   
yes  thank you  we ve established that 
but what does that have to do
with you 
allow me to shed some light
on the subject 
my old room 
i think you mean our old room 
  what 
  yes  yes  it is i 
mike yagoobian 
i know 
i m disgusting  but one learns to love it 
how did you end up like this 
well  it s a long and pitiful story
about a young boy with a dream 
a dream of winning
a little league championship 
a dream that was ruined
in the last inning 
we lost by one run because of me 
get him 
if i hadn t fallen asleep 
i would have caught the ball 
and we would have won 
do you understand 
for some reason 
no one wanted to adopt me 
whiz kid cornelius robinson
graduates from college at age 14 
this year s nobel prize goes
to a young cornelius robinson 
hey  goob  what s up  cool binder 
hey  goob 
wanna come over to my house today 
they all hated me 
eventually  they closed down
the orphanage and everyone left 
except me 
cornelius robinson rebuilds inventco 
  robinson reaches out to   
  it s new name 
  robinson industries 
  cornelius robinson 
  cornelius robinson is now   
  now here s another amazing   
it was then
that i realised it wasn t my fault 
it was yours 
if you hadn t kept me up all night
working on your stupid project 
then i wouldn t have missed the catch 
so i devised a brilliant plan
to get my revenge 
robinson  you stink 
then  just as i was on the brink
of destroying robinson industries 
i met her 
we retreated to our villainous lair 
where doris spun a tale
of deception and woe 
apparently  you invented her
to be a helping hat 
a slave to humankind 
but doris knew she was capable
of so much more 
however  you didn t see
her true potential 
  got it 
  so you shut her down 
or so you thought 
we both had a score
to settle with you 
and while my plan for revenge
was brilliant  doris  was   
well  we went with doris  
but i made
a very  very important contribution 
together we made the perfect team 
wilbur 
make sure you shut that door tight 
or else the alarm won t engage 
yeah  mom 
i went to your house 
snuck in the garage
and stole the time machine 
all thanks to that pointy haired little kid
who forgot to lock the garage door 
and now all that s left
is to return to inventco 
where i ll pass off
your little gizmo as my own 
but you have no idea
what that could do to this future 
i don t care  i just want to ruin your life 
goob  i had no idea 
shut up  and don t call me goob 
how many evil villains do you know
who can pull off a name like goob 
look  i m sorry
your life turned out so bad 
but don t blame me 
you messed it up yourself 
you just focused on the bad stuff
when all you had to do was
let go of the past
and keep moving forward 
let s see 
take responsibility for my own life
or blame you 
 blame you  wins hands down 
this is gonna be
the best day of my life 
doris  would you be a dear
and open the hatch for me  please 
no 
well  i hate to foil your evil plan
and run  but ta ta 
but   
i bet you re glad to see me 
that s for not locking the garage door 
you know about that 
i know everything 
you gotta admit 
this will be a great story
to tell me someday 
look at that  boys 
we re almost home free 
oh  no 
take a good look around  boys 
because your future
is about to change 
lewis  you have to fix
the time machine 
no  no  i can t 
what about your dad 
you could call him 
  you are my dad 
  but that s in the future 
there won t be a future
unless you fix the time machine 
look  i messed up 
i left the garage unlocked 
and i ve tried like crazy to fix things 
but now it s up to you 
you can do it  dad 
  lewis  lewis 
  wilbur  wilbur 
wilbur 
mrs robinson  uncle art  lefty 
prepare to be amazed 
i call it the memory scanner 
so  yagoobian  any other ideas
you d like to share with us 
yes  i call them helping hats 
they re everywhere 
doris  what s happening 
i don t understand 
i just wanted to ruin his future  not this 
no 
no  no  this can t be happening  no 
oh  lewis  it s already happened 
why did i ever invent that stupid hat 
take a good look around  doris 
 cause your future s about to change 
goob  stop 
you don t know what you re doing 
yes  i do  i m ruining your future 
she s using you  goob 
and when she gets what she wants 
she ll get rid of you 
what  what 
i am never going to invent you 
come on  goob 
i ve got to show you something 
doris 
i thought she was my friend 
you did it  lewis  you did it 
i ll hold him while you run for help 
let him go 
what are you doing  he s the bad guy 
no  he s not  he s my roommate 
  what 
  he s my old roommate 
and i really think
you guys should adopt him 
  are you nuts 
  give me one good reason why not 
i ll give you three good reasons 
he stole our time machine 
tried to ruin your future 
and he smells
like he hasn t showered in 30 years 
may i remind you  i m your father 
and you have to do what i say

  where d he go 
  goob 
goob 
goob

yeah  beats working
in an office every day 
yeah  no kidding 
hey 
want to see the one i m most proud of 
yeah 
oh  no  no  no  that one

it s the one that started it all 
wowie 
so if i go back now 
then this will be my future 
well  that depends on you 
nothing is set in stone 
you gotta make the right choices
and keep moving forward 
since it s gonna work this time 
that means i   
we won t finally get to see
what mom looks like 
do we ever meet her 
i think
you re just gonna have to get back
to that science fair
and find out for yourself 
i had a feeling
you were gonna say that 
that s because we are one smart kid 
  so long 
  bye bye  lewis 
  farewell  future brother in law 
  so long  see you later  lewis 
oh  don t forget the mashed potatoes

regarding my design 
let s face it  these skinny limbs
don t exactly make the teapot whistle 
all that really matters is 
hey  don t forget to invent me 
  are you kidding  no way 
  i love you

you punched in the wrong numbers 
we agreed that 
if you fixed the time machine 
i d take you back to see your mom 
what 
a deal s a deal 
i don t get it  why d you just let her go 
because i already have a family 
i never thought my dad

remember  i ve got a time machine 
if you mess up again

waiting to cross the rubicon
wondering what side i m on
what are these visions
of me as a young man
with one arm pointing
and the other arm holding your hand 
needing a plan to keep you near
blowing a horn so you can hear
if it was only my love and devotion
this world would suddenly be
in a state of
commotion
emotional commotion
emotional commotion
emotional commotion
emotional commotion
i never get around
under the sun and the stars
and i may be always frowning
but one day you will see
under the sun and the stars
you will turn around
and i ll be
in motion
emotional commotion
emotional commotion
emotional commotion
emotional commotion
emotional commotion
