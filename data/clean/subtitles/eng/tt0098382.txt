   i can t believe you d kill me
for a field of empty holes 
it s all i have 
  your pain runs deep 
  what do you know of my pain 
let us explore it    together 
each man hides a secret pain 
it must be exposed and reckoned with 
it must be dragged
from the darkness into the light 
share your pain 
share your pain with me 
and gain strength from the sharing 
where did you get this power 
the power was within you 
it is as if a weight
has been lifted from my heart 
  how can i repay you 
  join my quest 
  what is it you seek 
  what you seek 
what all men have sought
since time began 
the ultimate knowledge 
to find it we need a starship 
a starship  there are
no starships on nimbus iii 
  i have a way to bring one here 
  but how 
have faith  my friend 
there are more of us than you know 
you re a vulcan 
 you ll have a great time
on shore leave  bones  
 you ll be able to relax  
you call this relaxing 
i m a nervous wreck 
if i m not careful 
i ll end up talking to myself 
greetings  captain 
  spock  what are you doing here 
  i m monitoring your progress 
i m flattered  but of all the
points of interest here why pick me 
the record for climbing el capitan
is in no danger of being broken 
i m doing this because i enjoy it 
not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain   
because it s there 
i do not think you realise
the gravity of your situation 
on the contrary 
gravity is foremost on my mind 
i m trying to make an ascent 
go pester dr mccoy 
dr mccoy is not in the best of moods 
goddamn irresponsible 
playing games with life 
concentration is vital 
you must be one with the rock 
if you don t stop distracting me   
perhaps  because it is there  is not
sufficient reason to climb a mountain 
i am hardly in a position to disagree 
hi  bones 
mind if we drop in for dinner 
  i am caithlin dar 
  yes  our new romulan representative 
welcome to paradise city  capital
of the planet of galactic peace 
i m st john talbot  the federation
representative here on nimbus iii 
my charming companion
is the klingon consul  korrd 
  i expect that s klingon for hello 
  come in  my dear 
20 years ago  our three governments
agreed to develop this planet 
  a new age was born 
  it died a quick death 
the settlers we conned into
coming here took to fighting 
we forbad them weapons 
but they fashioned their own 
it appears i ve arrived just in time 
get away from that transmitter 
romulan 
terran 
klingon 
  consider yourselves my prisoners 
  prisoners 
we re already prisoners here
on this worthless lump of rock 
  what value could we be to you 
  nimbus iii is a worthless lump of rock 
but it is the only place in the galaxy
that has the three of you 
our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety 
that s exactly what i m counting on 
uss enterprise 
shakedown cruise report 
i think this new ship
was put together by monkeys 
half the doors won t open  and guess
whosejob it is to make it right 
borgus frat 
 let s see what she s got  scotty  
we found out  didn t we 
  i know you ll whip her into shape 
  uhura  i thought you were on leave 
  i thought we were going together 
  i can t leave her when she needs me 
i had a feeling you would
say something like that 
so i brought us dinner 
you re the most understanding woman
i know 
red alert 
i just fixed that damn thing 
turn it off  will you 
red alert 
this is a red alert 
enterprise  acknowledge 
this is enterprise  identify yourself 
this is starfleet  we have a priority 7
situation in the neutral zone 
  scotty  this is for real 
  they can t be serious 
the ship s in pieces and
we ve got less than a skeleton crew 
starfleet  are you aware
of our current status 
yes  stand by to copy operational
orders and recall key personnel 
  admit it  we re lost 
  yes  but we re making good time 
  commander sulu  come in 
  i don t believe this 
shore leave is cancelled 
  rescued at last 
  return to prearranged coordinates 
  you can t say we re lost 
  is there a problem 
yes  we ve been caught in    a blizzard 
we can t see a thing 
direct us to the coordinates 
my visual says
sunny skies and 70 degrees 
look  the sun has come out 
it s a miracle 
don t worry  your secret is safe
with me  i ll send the shuttle for you 
uhura  i owe you one 
come and get it 
bones  knock it off 
we re right here and we re starving 
  bipodal seeds  doctor 
  beans  spock  but no ordinary beans 
these are from an old recipe
handed down to me by my father 
if you stick your vulcan nose
up at these   
you re insulting
generations of mccoys 
in that case i have little choice
but to sample your beans 
surprisingly good  it does have
a flavouring i m not familiar with 
  that s the secret ingredient 
  any more secret ingredient  bones 
be my guest 
  your secret ingredient is alcohol 
  tennessee whiskey 
bourbon and beans  an explosive
combination  can spock handle it 
with that vulcan metabolism 
he could eat a bowl of termites 
  doctor  i am half human 
  it certainly doesn t show 
  thank you 
  this guy never changes 
i insult him
and he takes it as a compliment 
  you two could drive a man to drink 
  what did i do 
human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts 
you should have been killed
when you fell off that mountain 
it did cross my mind 
but even as i fell
i knew i wouldn t die 
  isn t he the only one who s immortal 
  no  it isn t that 
i knew i wouldn t die
because the two of you were with me 
  i do not understand 
  i ve always known   
   i ll die alone 
i ll call valhalla and
reserve a room for you 
all that time in space 
getting on each other s nerves   
so what do we do on shore leave 
we spend it together 
  other people have families 
  other people  not us 
what are you doing 
i m preparing to toast a  marsh melon  
i ll be damned  a marsh melon 
where did you learn to do that 
i have familiarised myself with the
customs associated with camping out 
what do we do
after we toast the marsh melon 
  we consume them 
  no  i mean after that 
we are required to engage in a ritual
known as the sing along 
i haven t sung around the campfire
since i was a boy in iowa 
what are we going to sing 
   camptown races  
   pack up your troubles  
  are we leaving 
  it s a song title 
   moon over rigel 7  
   row  row  row your boat  
  do you know  row your boat  
  it didn t come up in my research 
the lyrics are very simple   
 row  row  row your boat
gently down the stream  
 merrily  merrily  merrily  merrily 
life is but a dream  
the doctor and i will start off
and you jump in 
  doctor  if you please 
  don t say i didn t warn you 
  spock  why didn t you jump in 
  i cannot comprehend the words 
it s a song  you green blooded vulcan 
the words aren t important 
  you just have a good time singing 
  i am sorry  doctor 
  were we having a good time 
  i liked him better before he died 
let s just get some sleep 
  captain   
  we re on leave  call me jim 
  jim   
  yes  spock 
life is not a dream 
  go to sleep  spock 
  yes  captain 
  good night  bones 
  good night  jim 
  good night  spock 
  good night  doctor 
  good night  spock 
  good night  jim 
i don t know  i just don t know 
get the damn light out of my face 
we had to send the shuttlecraft 
the transporter is non operational 
  we have received new orders 
  i had my communicator 
  you forgot to take it with you 
  i wonder why i did that 
it appears shore leave has been
cancelled  pack out your trash 
 all i ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by  
  melville 
  john masefield 
  are you sure about that 
  i m well versed in the classics 
then how come you don t know
 row  row  row your boat  
  enterprise  you have control 
  we re doing just fine 
all i can say is  they don t make them
like they used to 
you told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks 
i think you gave me too much time 
how many times do i have to tell you 
the right tool for the right job 
i ve never seen him happier 
bridge    i hope 
i could use a shower 
yes 
  doesn t anything work on this ship 
  they can t send us out like this 
  starfleet transmission on line 
  put it on the view screen 
can we have a little quiet  please 
can you clear that up 
can we have a little quiet 
  bob 
  jim 
  we are dressing informally 
  i m on my way to the shower 
i apologise for cancelling shore leave 
we have a dangerous situation
out on nimbus iii 
on the planet of galactic peace 
a terrorist force
has captured the only settlement 
they ve taken hostages  the klingon 
the romulan  the federation consuls 
  the enterprise is not up to specs   
  the enterprise is a disaster 
  we have ships in the quadrant 
  but no experienced commanders 
  i need jim kirk 
  please 
proceed to nimbus iii
and assess the situation 
avoid a confrontation 
above all  however 
get those hostages back safely 
  have the klingons responded 
  no  but you can bet they will 
  plot a course for nimbus iii  mr sulu 
  course plotted 
i m afraid the ship s problems
will have to be solved en route 
i m counting on each one of you
to give his best  let s go to work 
jim  if you ask me  and you haven t   
i think this is a terrible idea 
we re bound to bump into the klingons 
  and they don t exactly like you 
  the feeling s mutual 
engine room  we ll need all the power
you can muster  mister 
we ll beat those klingon devils
even if i have to get out and push 
i hope it won t come to that 
  all possible speed  mr sulu 
  aye  sir 
  what s the matter 
  i miss my old chair 
captain s log  stardate 84   
captain s log  stardate 84   
  good morning  captain 
  forget it 
  we have the hostage information 
  put it on the screen 
this is an authorised transmission
from the starfleet memory bank 
  not general korrd 
  he s apparently fallen from favour 
korrd s military strategies were
required learning at the academy 
when they put me out to pasture 
i hope i fair better than korrd 
this must be the hostage tape 
a short time ago  we surrendered
to the galactic army of light 
we are now in the protective custody
of their leader 
we will be treated humanely
as long as we cooperate 
he requests that you send a starship
to parley for our release at once 
we are in good health and would
appreciate your immediate response 
i regret this desperate act 
but these are desperate times 
i mean no harm to these innocents 
but do not put me to the test 
i implore you to respond immediately 
what is it 
  you look like you ve seen a ghost 
  perhaps i have  captain 
spock  what is it 
do you know this vulcan 
  i cannot be certain 
  but he does seem familiar 
he reminds me of someone
i knew in my youth 
  i didn t know you had one 
  i do not often think of the past 
  who does he remind you of 
  a gifted young student 
he possessed a great intelligence 
it was assumed that he would
join the great scholars of vulcan 
  but he was a revolutionary 
  what do you mean 
the knowledge he sought
was forbidden by vulcan belief 
  forbidden 
  he rejected his logical upbringing 
he embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors 
he believed the key to self knowledge
was emotion    not logic 
imagine that  a passionate vulcan 
when he encouraged others to follow
him  he was banished from vulcan 
fascinating 
  captain to the bridge 
  on my way 
  spock 
  coming  captain 
  approaching nimbus iii 
  standard orbit  mr sulu 
paradise city is demanding
to know our intentions 
respond with static 
let them think we re having difficulty 
paradise city  we are barely
receiving your transmission 
  transporter room  status 
  transporter is still inoperative 
if we could lock on to the hostages 
we couldn t beam them up 
  we ll have to get them out ourselves 
  klingon vessel approaching 
bird of prey 
1 9 hours till her weapons are in range 
damn  let s go 
their scanning equipment
is primitive  but effective 
  land at coordinate 856 3 
  that s far from the city 
  we cannot risk detection 
  mr sulu  execute 
  this is the starship enterprise 
  a federation starship 
this is captain pavel chekov 
you are in violation of our treaty 
release your hostages at once
or suffer the consequences 
your threats amuse me 
what consequences 
a klingon warship
will arrive within the hour 
  the klingons will be quite angry 
  they are likely to destroy the planet 
then it is fortunate i have you
and your starship to protect me 
you and your first officer
are to beam down to my coordinates 
we will be happy to beam down 
but we must have certain assurances 
at foot speed the journey
to the city will take 1 2 hours 
we don t have 1 2 hours 
wait a minute    perfect 
we ll have to get their attention 
what s that 
is she naked 
hello  boys 
i ve always wanted to play
to a captive audience 
  spock  be one with the horse 
  yes  captain 
open the gate 
it s our lookout party 
federation soldiers are right behind us 
close the gate 
where are they going 
  spock   
  hold your horse  i m scanning 
the hostages are being held
in that structure 
galileo  start your run 
phasers on stun 
sulu  take out that light 
  what s going on 
  surrender  you are under attack 
  it wasn t bloodshed i wanted 
  wait  come back 
  uhura  come on down 
  roger  coming in 
nimbus iii is famous for its wildlife 
and the fishing is terrific 
easy financing through
federation federal can take you there 
  thank god 
  please cooperate 
hand over your weapons 
well done  my friends 
qual se tu 
spock 
spock  it s me 
it s sybok 
you ve finally caught up with me 
don t you have anything to say to me 
you are under arrest for 17 violations
of the neutral zone treaty 
  you ve developed a sense of humour 
  i did not intend to amuse you 
these are serious charges 
however  if you surrender now   
i m sorry  spock  i m not through
violating the neutral zone treaty 
in fact  i m just getting started 
for my next violation   
i intend to steal something 
something very big 
your starship 
you staged all this
to get your hands on my ship 
  who are you 
  captain james t  kirk 
i thought captain chekov   
i see    very clever  captain 
spock  you have been given
a second chance to join me 
  i am a starfleet officer 
  of course 
of course  then i ll take the ship
without your help 
  shuttle en route 
  position of bird of prey 
closing 
  the bird of prey must have cloaked 
  raise shields 
  the shuttle 
  do it  go to red alert 
once we control your vessel 
we ll bring up our followers 
the klingons are out there 
we ll be lucky to make it to the ship 
this is enterprise  red alert 
bird of prey approaching 
raising shields 
find a safe harbour 
no 
no reply  remain on course 
listen to me  in order for this
craft to enter the landing bay   
enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam 
  to re raise the shields will take   
  15 5 seconds 
an eternity  during which
we ll be vulnerable to attack 
he speaks the truth  if my people
are cloaked  then they intend to strike 
  we cannot turn back 
  let me do something 
very well  do what you must 
but no more 
enterprise  this is kirk 
understand your situation 
are unable to return to planet 
stand by to execute
emergency landing plan    b 
  emergency landing plan b 
  b as in barricade 
what are you doing 
in order to lower and raise the shields
quickly  we ll forego the tractor beam 
we ll fly her in manually 
  how often have you done this 
  actually  it s my first attempt 
he s good    really 
scotty  open bay doors 
scotty  lower shields 
lowering shields 
  bird of prey bearing 105 2 
  go  sulu 
they re in 
warp speed now 
we must change course at once 
i ll take you to the bridge 
pick it up 
sybok   
you must surrender 
no 
  you must kill me 
  shoot him 
for a moment   
i thought you might actually do it 
put him in the brig with captain kirk 
spock  you will accompany me
to the bridge 
no    i will not 
you know i m right 
then you must join them 
  these two will be useful 
  give us a moment alone 
don t be afraid 
goddamn it  spock 
you betrayed us all 
i do not expect you to forgive me 
  i ought to knock you on your ass 
  if you think it would help 
  you want me to hold him 
  stay out of this    why 
  all you had to do was pull the trigger 
  then sybok would be dead 
  i ordered you to defend your ship 
  and kill my brother 
  a fellow vulcan is not a   
  sybok also is a son of sarek 
he s your brother brother 
you made that up 
  i did not 
  you don t have a brother 
  technically i don t have a brother 
  see 
  i have a half brother 
  i ve got to sit down 
you and sybok have the same father
but different mothers 
sybok s mother was a vulcan princess 
but we were raised as brothers 
  why didn t you tell us this before 
  it is a personal matter 
  for that i am sorry 
  that makes everything all right  sorry 
spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you 
he s already in the brig  besides 
we ve got bigger problems to deal with 
like how do we get out of here 
i ll say one thing 
you never cease to amaze me 
nor i myself 
  i was beginning to worry 
  it s all right  sybok will explain 
  what are you doing 
  plotting our new course 
you have no authority 
  what s going on here 
  pavel  listen to this man 
  i don t understand 
  each of us hides a secret pain 
share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing 
useless 
unwise 
you could have warned me 
there s got to be a way out 
  this new brig is escape proof 
  how do you know 
the designers tested it using the most
intelligent person they could find 
  he failed to escape 
  did this person have pointed ears 
and an unerring capacity
for getting his shipmates into trouble 
he did have pointed ears 
  following new course  warp 7 
  arrival in 6 7 hours at present speed 
now that we re underway  i ll announce
my intentions to the rest of the ship 
brave crew of the starship enterprise 
consider the questions of existence 
questions that man has asked since
he first gazed at the stars and dreamed 
my vulcan ancestors
were ruled by their emotions 
they felt with their hearts 
they made love with their hearts 
they believed with their hearts 
and they believed in a place where
these questions would be answered 
modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth 
a fantasy concocted by pagans 
it is no fantasy 
i tell you    it exists 
my brothers  we have been chosen  
  to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time 
the discovery of sha ka ree 
is it possible he s found sha ka ree 
the reason he left vulcan 
our destination
is the planet sha ka ree 
it lies beyond the great barrier   
    at the centre of the galaxy 
  the centre of the galaxy 
  where it is fabled to exist 
the centre of the galaxy
can t be reached by any ship 
sybok possessed the keenest intellect
i ve ever known 
when i get the ship back 
and sybok is in here   
you can debate sha ka ree
until you re green in the face 
you re either with me or you re not 
  i am here  captain 
  that s a little vague  spock 
what s that noise 
it s a primitive form of communication
known as morse code 
you re right  i m out of practice 
that s an s 
  t   
  a   
n    d    end of word 
  stand 
  new word 
b    a   
c    k   
  back 
  stand back 
what are you standing around for 
this is a jailbreak 
these three are strong 
this will be quite a challenge 
we ve got to find them 
  we can t trust anyone 
  we can send a distress signal 
there is an emergency sending
apparatus in the observation room 
you might be able to reach it
by means of turbo shaft 3 
  it s a long and dangerous climb 
  some of us get off on that 
get the transporter working
and contact a rescue ship 
  which way to the turbo shaft 
  down that tunnel and turn right 
  you can t miss it 
  mr scott  you re amazing 
i know this ship
like the back of my hand 
  we ll get a good workout 
  yeah  or a heart attack 
get mr scott to sick bay 
this is going to take me forever 
where s spock 
i believe i ve found a faster way 
  bones 
  i ll wait for the next car 
we re not splitting up 
  we re too heavy 
  it must be the marsh melons 
  spock  the booster rockets 
  i can t control their power 
fire the rockets 
captain  please come back down 
hit the brakes 
  i overshot the mark by one level 
  nobody s perfect 
spock 
emergency channel open 
to anyone within range 
this is captain james t  kirk 
if you read me  acknowledge 
acknowledge 
this is starfleet command 
we read you  over 
a hostile force
has taken control of our vessel 
our coordinates are 000 2 
request emergency assistance 
understood enterprise  we are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately 
  i trust your message was received 
  you can t expect us to stand by 
what you fear is the unknown 
the people of your planet
once believed their world was flat 
columbus proved it was round 
they said the sound barrier
could never be broken  it was broken 
they said warp speed
could not be achieved 
the great barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear 
it is an extension of personal fear 
captain kirk  i so much
want your understanding 
i want your respect 
are you afraid to hear me out 
  i m afraid of nothing 
  wait outside 
i m sure you have many questions 
here  amidst the stars
of our own galaxy   
we shall seek the answers
together 
easy  scotty 
you re back with us 
i dreamt that a madman
had taken over the enterprise 
  he s not a madman 
  he s not 
sybok has put us in touch with feelings
we ve always been afraid to express 
  i have to get to the transporter 
  scotty 
  there s so much i want to tell you 
  wait till i m a wee bit stronger 
i don t think i could take it
in my present condition    or yours 
sha ka ree 
the source 
heaven 
eden 
call it what you will 
the klingons call it qui tu 
the romulans  vorta vor 
in andorian it is unpronounceable 
still  every culture shares
this common dream 
a place from which creation sprang 
for us it will soon be reality 
my only reality is that
i m a prisoner on my own ship 
what is this power you have
to control the minds of my crew 
i don t control minds    i free them 
how 
by making you face your pain
and draw strength from it 
once that s done  fear cannot stop you 
it sounds like brainwashing to me 
your pain is the deepest of all 
i can feel it  can t you 
leonard 
this is some kind of trick 
leonard 
father 
my god  don t do this to me 
leonard 
i m here  i m with you  dad 
the pain  stop the pain 
i ve done everything i can do 
you ve got to hang on 
i can t stand the pain 
help me 
all my knowledge and i can t save him 
you ve done all you can 
the support system will keep him alive 
  you call this alive 
  son   
  release me 
  i can t do that  dad 
but how can i watch him suffer
like this 
you re a doctor 
i m his son 
why did you do it 
to preserve his dignity 
  that wasn t the worst of it  was it 
  no 
share it 
not long after  they found a cure 
a goddamn cure 
  if you didn t kill him  he d have lived 
  i released him 
  you did what you thought was right 
  yes  no 
release this pain 
this pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time 
now you ve taken the first step 
the other steps we ll take together 
each man s pain is unique 
i hide no pain 
  i know you better than that 
  do you 
  spock  don t 
  it s all right  captain 
proceed 
  what is this 
  i believe we are witnessing my birth 
sarek  your son 
so human 
spock 
  what have you done to my friends 
  nothing  this is who they are 
  didn t you know that 
  no  i didn t 
  now learn something about yourself 
  no  i refuse 
  jim  try to be open about this 
  about what 
how i made wrong choices in my life 
turning left instead of right 
i don t need sybok to take me
on a tour of my weaknesses 
to be brainwashed by a conman 
  this conman took away my pain 
  with the wave of a magic wand 
the things we carry with us
make us who we are 
if we lose them  we lose ourselves 
i don t want my pain taken away 
i need my pain 
captain  you remain here 
spock  dr mccoy  come with me 
  spock 
  i cannot go with you 
  why not 
  i belong here 
  i don t understand 
  sybok   
you are my brother 
but you do not know me 
i am not the outcast boy
you left behind many years ago 
i found myself and my place 
and i know who i am 
i cannot go with you 
you d better count me out  too 
  then i ll see you on the other side 
  wait 
we ll never make it
through the great barrier 
if we do  will that convince you
that my vision was true 
it was given to me by god 
he waits for us on the other side 
you are mad 
am i 
we ll see 
they say no ship can survive this 
they re wrong  danger is an illusion 
we have no instrument readings 
  mr sulu  full ahead 
  full ahead  aye 
  is it possible 
  fascinating 
are we dreaming 
if we are  then life is a dream 
instruments are back on line 
incredible 
there is a power source emanating
from the planet like nothing i ve seen 
  sha ka ree 
  qui tu 
vorta vor 
eden 
  about the ship   
  the ship needs its captain 
  no special conditions 
  no conditions 
  i could turn us around 
  no  you too must know 
well  if we re going to do it 
we re going to do it by the book 
standard orbital approach 
alert the shuttlecraft to stand by 
sybok  spock  mccoy  come with me 
the rest of you remain on board 
until i determine
what we re dealing with 
don t just stand there 
god s a busy man 
i am no longer in control of the craft 
all right  we ll play it your way 
it s amazing  the land  the sky 
just as i knew it would be 
  you have to see this 
  i don t have time 
the captain told me
to get the transporter working 
we have travelled far 
by starship 
enterprise  this is kirk 
we have   
sybok 
perhaps   
brave souls  welcome 
is this the voice of god 
one voice  many faces 
does this better
suit your expectations 
  qual se tu 
  it is i 
your journey
could not have been an easy one 
it was not 
we had to breach the barrier 
magnificent 
you are the first to find me 
  we sought only your infinite wisdom 
  how did you breach the barrier 
  with a starship 
  this starship   
could it carry my wisdom
beyond the barrier 
  it could  yes 
  then i shall make use of it 
  it will be your chariot 
  excuse me   
  i will reach every corner of creation 
  i d like to ask a question 
  what does god need with a starship 
  bring the ship closer 
what does god need with a starship 
  what are you doing 
  asking a question 
  who is this creature 
  don t you know  aren t you god 
  he has his doubts 
  you doubt me 
  i seek proof 
  you don t ask the almighty for his id 
then here is the proof you seek 
  why is god angry 
  why have you done this 
  he doubts me 
  you have not answered his question 
what does god need with a starship 
do you doubt me 
i doubt any god who inflicts pain
for his own pleasure 
stop  the god of sha ka ree
would not do this 
sha ka ree  a vision you created 
an eternity i ve been
imprisoned in this place 
the ship  i must have the ship 
now    give me what i want 
sybok   
this is not the god of sha ka ree 
or any other god 
i don t understand 
reveal yourself to me 
what s wrong 
don t you like this face 
i have so many 
but this one suits you best 
no  it s not possible 
bring me the ship
or i will destroy you 
  the ship 
  bring it closer   
   so that i might join with it 
do it  or watch these puny things  
  die horribly 
  what have i done 
  enterprise  listen carefully 
this is my doing  this is my arrogance 
my vanity 
  sybok  we must find a way   
  no  save yourselves

it runs deep  share it with me

  about the progress we ve made 
she has wonderful muscles 
cosmic thoughts  gentlemen
