i cant believe youd kill me
for a field of empty holes
its all i have
your pain runs deep
what do you know of my pain
let us explore it together
each man hides a secret pain
it must be exposed and reckoned with
it must be dragged
from the darkness into the light
share your pain
share your pain with me
and gain strength from the sharing
where did you get this power
the power was within you
it is as if a weight
has been lifted from my heart
how can i repay you
join my quest
what is it you seek
what you seek
what all men have sought
since time began
the ultimate knowledge
to find it we need a starship
a starship there are
no starships on nimbus iii
i have a way to bring one here
but how
have faith my friend
there are more of us than you know
youre a vulcan
youll have a great time
on shore leave bones
youll be able to relax
you call this relaxing
im a nervous wreck
if im not careful
ill end up talking to myself
greetings captain
spock what are you doing here
im monitoring your progress
im flattered but of all the
points of interest here why pick me
the record for climbing el capitan
is in no danger of being broken
im doing this because i enjoy it
not to mention the most important
reason for climbing a mountain
because its there
i do not think you realise
the gravity of your situation
on the contrary
gravity is foremost on my mind
im trying to make an ascent
go pester dr mccoy
dr mccoy is not in the best of moods
goddamn irresponsible
playing games with life
concentration is vital
you must be one with the rock
if you dont stop distracting me
perhaps because it is there is not
sufficient reason to climb a mountain
i am hardly in a position to disagree
hi bones
mind if we drop in for dinner
i am caithlin dar
yes our new romulan representative
welcome to paradise city capital
of the planet of galactic peace
im st john talbot the federation
representative here on nimbus iii
my charming companion
is the klingon consul korrd
i expect thats klingon for hello
come in my dear
20 years ago our three governments
agreed to develop this planet
a new age was born
it died a quick death
the settlers we conned into
coming here took to fighting
we forbad them weapons
but they fashioned their own
it appears ive arrived just in time
get away from that transmitter
romulan
terran
klingon
consider yourselves my prisoners
prisoners
were already prisoners here
on this worthless lump of rock
what value could we be to you
nimbus iii is a worthless lump of rock
but it is the only place in the galaxy
that has the three of you
our governments will stop at nothing
to ensure our safety
thats exactly what im counting on
uss enterprise
shakedown cruise report
i think this new ship
was put together by monkeys
half the doors wont open and guess
whosejob it is to make it right
borgus frat
lets see what shes got scotty
we found out didnt we
i know youll whip her into shape
uhura i thought you were on leave
i thought we were going together
i cant leave her when she needs me
i had a feeling you would
say something like that
so i brought us dinner
youre the most understanding woman
i know
red alert
i just fixed that damn thing
turn it off will you
red alert
this is a red alert
enterprise acknowledge
this is enterprise identify yourself
this is starfleet we have a priority 7
situation in the neutral zone
scotty this is for real
they cant be serious
the ships in pieces and
weve got less than a skeleton crew
starfleet are you aware
of our current status
yes stand by to copy operational
orders and recall key personnel
admit it were lost
yes but were making good time
commander sulu come in
i dont believe this
shore leave is cancelled
rescued at last
return to prearranged coordinates
you cant say were lost
is there a problem
yes weve been caught in a blizzard
we cant see a thing
direct us to the coordinates
my visual says
sunny skies and 70 degrees
look the sun has come out
its a miracle
dont worry your secret is safe
with me ill send the shuttle for you
uhura i owe you one
come and get it
bones knock it off
were right here and were starving
bipodal seeds doctor
beans spock but no ordinary beans
these are from an old recipe
handed down to me by my father
if you stick your vulcan nose
up at these
youre insulting
generations of mccoys
in that case i have little choice
but to sample your beans
surprisingly good it does have
a flavouring im not familiar with
thats the secret ingredient
any more secret ingredient bones
be my guest
your secret ingredient is alcohol
tennessee whiskey
bourbon and beans an explosive
combination can spock handle it
with that vulcan metabolism
he could eat a bowl of termites
doctor i am half human
it certainly doesnt show
thank you
this guy never changes
i insult him
and he takes it as a compliment
you two could drive a man to drink
what did i do
human life is far too precious
to risk on crazy stunts
you should have been killed
when you fell off that mountain
it did cross my mind
but even as i fell
i knew i wouldnt die
isnt he the only one whos immortal
no it isnt that
i knew i wouldnt die
because the two of you were with me
i do not understand
ive always known
ill die alone
ill call valhalla and
reserve a room for you
all that time in space
getting on each others nerves
so what do we do on shore leave
we spend it together
other people have families
other people not us
what are you doing
im preparing to toast a marsh melon
ill be damned a marsh melon
where did you learn to do that
i have familiarised myself with the
customs associated with camping out
what do we do
after we toast the marsh melon
we consume them
no i mean after that
we are required to engage in a ritual
known as the singalong
i havent sung around the campfire
since i was a boy in iowa
what are we going to sing
camptown races
pack up your troubles
are we leaving
its a song title
moon over rigel 7
row row row your boat
do you know row your boat
it didnt come up in my research
the lyrics are very simple
row row row your boat
gently down the stream
merrily merrily merrily merrily
life is but a dream
the doctor and i will start off
and you jump in
doctor if you please
dont say i didnt warn you
spock why didnt you jump in
i cannot comprehend the words
its a song you greenblooded vulcan
the words arent important
you just have a good time singing
i am sorry doctor
were we having a good time
i liked him better before he died
lets just get some sleep
captain
were on leave call me jim
jim
yes spock
life is not a dream
go to sleep spock
yes captain
good night bones
good night jim
good night spock
good night doctor
good night spock
good night jim
i dont know i just dont know
get the damn light out of my face
we had to send the shuttlecraft
the transporter is nonoperational
we have received new orders
i had my communicator
you forgot to take it with you
i wonder why i did that
it appears shore leave has been
cancelled pack out your trash
all i ask is a tall ship
and a star to steer her by
melville
john masefield
are you sure about that
im wellversed in the classics
then how come you dont know
row row row your boat
enterprise you have control
were doing just fine
all i can say is they dont make them
like they used to
you told me you could have this ship
operational in two weeks
i think you gave me too much time
how many times do i have to tell you
the right tool for the right job
ive never seen him happier
bridge i hope
i could use a shower
yes
doesnt anything work on this ship
they cant send us out like this
starfleet transmission on line
put it on the view screen
can we have a little quiet please
can you clear that up
can we have a little quiet
bob
jim
we are dressing informally
im on my way to the shower
i apologise for cancelling shore leave
we have a dangerous situation
out on nimbus iii
on the planet of galactic peace
a terrorist force
has captured the only settlement
theyve taken hostages the klingon
the romulan the federation consuls
the enterprise is not up to specs
the enterprise is a disaster
we have ships in the quadrant
but no experienced commanders
i need jim kirk
please
proceed to nimbus iii
and assess the situation
avoid a confrontation
above all however
get those hostages back safely
have the klingons responded
no but you can bet they will
plot a course for nimbus iii mr sulu
course plotted
im afraid the ships problems
will have to be solved en route
im counting on each one of you
to give his best lets go to work
jim if you ask me and you havent
i think this is a terrible idea
were bound to bump into the klingons
and they dont exactly like you
the feelings mutual
engine room well need all the power
you can muster mister
well beat those klingon devils
even if i have to get out and push
i hope it wont come to that
all possible speed mr sulu
aye sir
whats the matter
i miss my old chair
captains log stardate 84
captains log stardate 84
good morning captain
forget it
we have the hostage information
put it on the screen
this is an authorised transmission
from the starfleet memory bank
not general korrd
hes apparently fallen from favour
korrds military strategies were
required learning at the academy
when they put me out to pasture
i hope i fair better than korrd
this must be the hostage tape
a short time ago we surrendered
to the galactic army of light
we are now in the protective custody
of their leader
we will be treated humanely
as long as we cooperate
he requests that you send a starship
to parley for our release at once
we are in good health and would
appreciate your immediate response
i regret this desperate act
but these are desperate times
i mean no harm to these innocents
but do not put me to the test
i implore you to respond immediately
what is it
you look like youve seen a ghost
perhaps i have captain
spock what is it
do you know this vulcan
i cannot be certain
but he does seem familiar
he reminds me of someone
i knew in my youth
i didnt know you had one
i do not often think of the past
who does he remind you of
a gifted young student
he possessed a great intelligence
it was assumed that he would
join the great scholars of vulcan
but he was a revolutionary
what do you mean
the knowledge he sought
was forbidden by vulcan belief
forbidden
he rejected his logical upbringing
he embraced the animal passions
of our ancestors
he believed the key to selfknowledge
was emotion not logic
imagine that a passionate vulcan
when he encouraged others to follow
him he was banished from vulcan
fascinating
captain to the bridge
on my way
spock
coming captain
approaching nimbus iii
standard orbit mr sulu
paradise city is demanding
to know our intentions
respond with static
let them think were having difficulty
paradise city we are barely
receiving your transmission
transporter room status
transporter is still inoperative
if we could lock on to the hostages
we couldnt beam them up
well have to get them out ourselves
klingon vessel approaching
bird of prey
19 hours till her weapons are in range
damn lets go
their scanning equipment
is primitive but effective
land at coordinate 8563
thats far from the city
we cannot risk detection
mr sulu execute
this is the starship enterprise
a federation starship
this is captain pavel chekov
you are in violation of our treaty
release your hostages at once
or suffer the consequences
your threats amuse me
what consequences
a klingon warship
will arrive within the hour
the klingons will be quite angry
they are likely to destroy the planet
then it is fortunate i have you
and your starship to protect me
you and your first officer
are to beam down to my coordinates
we will be happy to beam down
but we must have certain assurances
at foot speed the journey
to the city will take 12 hours
we dont have 12 hours
wait a minute perfect
well have to get their attention
whats that
is she naked
hello boys
ive always wanted to play
to a captive audience
spock be one with the horse
yes captain
open the gate
its our lookout party
federation soldiers are right behind us
close the gate
where are they going
spock
hold your horse im scanning
the hostages are being held
in that structure
galileo start your run
phasers on stun
sulu take out that light
whats going on
surrender you are under attack
it wasnt bloodshed i wanted
wait come back
uhura come on down
roger coming in
nimbus iii is famous for its wildlife
and the fishing is terrific
easy financing through
federation federal can take you there
thank god
please cooperate
hand over your weapons
well done my friends
qual se tu
spock
spock its me
its sybok
youve finally caught up with me
dont you have anything to say to me
you are under arrest for 17 violations
of the neutral zone treaty
youve developed a sense of humour
i did not intend to amuse you
these are serious charges
however if you surrender now
im sorry spock im not through
violating the neutral zone treaty
in fact im just getting started
for my next violation
i intend to steal something
something very big
your starship
you staged all this
to get your hands on my ship
who are you
captain james t kirk
i thought captain chekov
i see very clever captain
spock you have been given
a second chance to join me
i am a starfleet officer
of course
of course then ill take the ship
without your help
shuttle en route
position of bird of prey
closing
the bird of prey must have cloaked
raise shields
the shuttle
do it go to red alert
once we control your vessel
well bring up our followers
the klingons are out there
well be lucky to make it to the ship
this is enterprise red alert
bird of prey approaching
raising shields
find a safe harbour
no
no reply remain on course
listen to me in order for this
craft to enter the landing bay
enterprise must lower the shields
and activate the tractor beam
to reraise the shields will take
155 seconds
an eternity during which
well be vulnerable to attack
he speaks the truth if my people
are cloaked then they intend to strike
we cannot turn back
let me do something
very well do what you must
but no more
enterprise this is kirk
understand your situation
are unable to return to planet
stand by to execute
emergency landing plan b
emergency landing plan b
b as in barricade
what are you doing
in order to lower and raise the shields
quickly well forego the tractor beam
well fly her in manually
how often have you done this
actually its my first attempt
hes good really
scotty open bay doors
scotty lower shields
lowering shields
bird of prey bearing 1052
go sulu
theyre in
warp speed now
we must change course at once
ill take you to the bridge
pick it up
sybok
you must surrender
no
you must kill me
shoot him
for a moment
i thought you might actually do it
put him in the brig with captain kirk
spock you will accompany me
to the bridge
no i will not
you know im right
then you must join them
these two will be useful
give us a moment alone
dont be afraid
goddamn it spock
you betrayed us all
i do not expect you to forgive me
i ought to knock you on your ass
if you think it would help
you want me to hold him
stay out of this why
all you had to do was pull the trigger
then sybok would be dead
i ordered you to defend your ship
and kill my brother
a fellow vulcan is not a
sybok also is a son of sarek
hes your brother brother
you made that up
i did not
you dont have a brother
technically i dont have a brother
see
i have a halfbrother
ive got to sit down
you and sybok have the same father
but different mothers
syboks mother was a vulcan princess
but we were raised as brothers
why didnt you tell us this before
it is a personal matter
for that i am sorry
that makes everything all right sorry
spock could no more kill
his own brother than he could kill you
hes already in the brig besides
weve got bigger problems to deal with
like how do we get out of here
ill say one thing
you never cease to amaze me
nor i myself
i was beginning to worry
its all right sybok will explain
what are you doing
plotting our new course
you have no authority
whats going on here
pavel listen to this man
i dont understand
each of us hides a secret pain
share yours with me
and gain strength from the sharing
useless
unwise
you could have warned me
theres got to be a way out
this new brig is escapeproof
how do you know
the designers tested it using the most
intelligent person they could find
he failed to escape
did this person have pointed ears
and an unerring capacity
for getting his shipmates into trouble
he did have pointed ears
following new course warp 7
arrival in 67 hours at present speed
now that were underway ill announce
my intentions to the rest of the ship
brave crew of the starship enterprise
consider the questions of existence
questions that man has asked since
he first gazed at the stars and dreamed
my vulcan ancestors
were ruled by their emotions
they felt with their hearts
they made love with their hearts
they believed with their hearts
and they believed in a place where
these questions would be answered
modern dogma tells us
this place is a myth
a fantasy concocted by pagans
it is no fantasy
i tell you it exists
my brothers we have been chosen
to undertake
the greatest adventure of all time
the discovery of sha ka ree
is it possible hes found sha ka ree
the reason he left vulcan
our destination
is the planet sha ka ree
it lies beyond the great barrier
at the centre of the galaxy
the centre of the galaxy
where it is fabled to exist
the centre of the galaxy
cant be reached by any ship
sybok possessed the keenest intellect
ive ever known
when i get the ship back
and sybok is in here
you can debate sha ka ree
until youre green in the face
youre either with me or youre not
i am here captain
thats a little vague spock
whats that noise
its a primitive form of communication
known as morse code
youre right im out of practice
thats an s
t
a
n d end of word
stand
new word
b a
c k
back
stand back
what are you standing around for
this is a jailbreak
these three are strong
this will be quite a challenge
weve got to find them
we cant trust anyone
we can send a distress signal
there is an emergency sending
apparatus in the observation room
you might be able to reach it
by means of turboshaft 3
its a long and dangerous climb
some of us get off on that
get the transporter working
and contact a rescue ship
which way to the turboshaft
down that tunnel and turn right
you cant miss it
mr scott youre amazing
i know this ship
like the back of my hand
well get a good workout
yeah or a heart attack
get mr scott to sick bay
this is going to take me forever
wheres spock
i believe ive found a faster way
bones
ill wait for the next car
were not splitting up
were too heavy
it must be the marsh melons
spock the booster rockets
i cant control their power
fire the rockets
captain please come back down
hit the brakes
i overshot the mark by one level
nobodys perfect
spock
emergency channel open
to anyone within range
this is captain james t kirk
if you read me acknowledge
acknowledge
this is starfleet command
we read you over
a hostile force
has taken control of our vessel
our coordinates are 0002
request emergency assistance
understood enterprise we are
dispatching a rescue ship immediately
i trust your message was received
you cant expect us to stand by
what you fear is the unknown
the people of your planet
once believed their world was flat
columbus proved it was round
they said the sound barrier
could never be broken it was broken
they said warp speed
could not be achieved
the great barrier is the ultimate
expression of this universal fear
it is an extension of personal fear
captain kirk i so much
want your understanding
i want your respect
are you afraid to hear me out
im afraid of nothing
wait outside
im sure you have many questions
here amidst the stars
of our own galaxy
we shall seek the answers
together
easy scotty
youre back with us
i dreamt that a madman
had taken over the enterprise
hes not a madman
hes not
sybok has put us in touch with feelings
weve always been afraid to express
i have to get to the transporter
scotty
theres so much i want to tell you
wait till im a wee bit stronger
i dont think i could take it
in my present condition or yours
sha ka ree
the source
heaven
eden
call it what you will
the klingons call it qui tu
the romulans vorta vor
in andorian it is unpronounceable
still every culture shares
this common dream
a place from which creation sprang
for us it will soon be reality
my only reality is that
im a prisoner on my own ship
what is this power you have
to control the minds of my crew
i dont control minds i free them
how
by making you face your pain
and draw strength from it
once thats done fear cannot stop you
it sounds like brainwashing to me
your pain is the deepest of all
i can feel it cant you
leonard
this is some kind of trick
leonard
father
my god dont do this to me
leonard
im here im with you dad
the pain stop the pain
ive done everything i can do
youve got to hang on
i cant stand the pain
help me
all my knowledge and i cant save him
youve done all you can
the support system will keep him alive
you call this alive
son
release me
i cant do that dad
but how can i watch him suffer
like this
youre a doctor
im his son
why did you do it
to preserve his dignity
that wasnt the worst of it was it
no
share it
not long after they found a cure
a goddamn cure
if you didnt kill him hed have lived
i released him
you did what you thought was right
yes no
release this pain
this pain has poisoned your soul
for a long time
now youve taken the first step
the other steps well take together
each mans pain is unique
i hide no pain
i know you better than that
do you
spock dont
its all right captain
proceed
what is this
i believe we are witnessing my birth
sarek your son
so human
spock
what have you done to my friends
nothing this is who they are
didnt you know that
no i didnt
now learn something about yourself
no i refuse
jim try to be open about this
about what
how i made wrong choices in my life
turning left instead of right
i dont need sybok to take me
on a tour of my weaknesses
to be brainwashed by a conman
this conman took away my pain
with the wave of a magic wand
the things we carry with us
make us who we are
if we lose them we lose ourselves
i dont want my pain taken away
i need my pain
captain you remain here
spock dr mccoy come with me
spock
i cannot go with you
why not
i belong here
i dont understand
sybok
you are my brother
but you do not know me
i am not the outcast boy
you left behind many years ago
i found myself and my place
and i know who i am
i cannot go with you
youd better count me out too
then ill see you on the other side
wait
well never make it
through the great barrier
if we do will that convince you
that my vision was true
it was given to me by god
he waits for us on the other side
you are mad
am i
well see
they say no ship can survive this
theyre wrong danger is an illusion
we have no instrument readings
mr sulu full ahead
full ahead aye
is it possible
fascinating
are we dreaming
if we are then life is a dream
instruments are back on line
incredible
there is a power source emanating
from the planet like nothing ive seen
sha ka ree
qui tu
vorta vor
eden
about the ship
the ship needs its captain
no special conditions
no conditions
i could turn us around
no you too must know
well if were going to do it
were going to do it by the book
standard orbital approach
alert the shuttlecraft to stand by
sybok spock mccoy come with me
the rest of you remain on board
until i determine
what were dealing with
dont just stand there
gods a busy man
i am no longer in control of the craft
all right well play it your way
its amazing the land the sky
just as i knew it would be
you have to see this
i dont have time
the captain told me
to get the transporter working
we have travelled far
by starship
enterprise this is kirk
we have
sybok
perhaps
brave souls welcome
is this the voice of god
one voice many faces
does this better
suit your expectations
qual se tu
it is i
your journey
could not have been an easy one
it was not
we had to breach the barrier
magnificent
you are the first to find me
we sought only your infinite wisdom
how did you breach the barrier
with a starship
this starship
could it carry my wisdom
beyond the barrier
it could yes
then i shall make use of it
it will be your chariot
excuse me
i will reach every corner of creation
id like to ask a question
what does god need with a starship
bring the ship closer
what does god need with a starship
what are you doing
asking a question
who is this creature
dont you know arent you god
he has his doubts
you doubt me
i seek proof
you dont ask the almighty for his id
then here is the proof you seek
why is god angry
why have you done this
he doubts me
you have not answered his question
what does god need with a starship
do you doubt me
i doubt any god who inflicts pain
for his own pleasure
stop the god of sha ka ree
would not do this
sha ka ree a vision you created
an eternity ive been
imprisoned in this place
the ship i must have the ship
now give me what i want
sybok
this is not the god of sha ka ree
or any other god
i dont understand
reveal yourself to me
whats wrong
dont you like this face
i have so many
but this one suits you best
no its not possible
bring me the ship
or i will destroy you
the ship
bring it closer
so that i might join with it
do it or watch these puny things
die horribly
what have i done
enterprise listen carefully
this is my doing this is my arrogance
my vanity
sybok we must find a way
no save yourselves
forgive me brother
i couldnt help but notice your pain
it runs deep share it with me
enterprise are you ready
torpedo armed
were firing on your position
send it down now
run
sybok
lets get out of here
sulu ive lost them
spock get us out of here
thrusters are inoperative
mr scott please tell me
the transporter is working
i might be able to beam up two of you
beam up spock and dr mccoy now
just a damn minute
bring up the captain
we cant just leave jim down there
get a grip on yourself status report
the klingon captain
wishes to name his terms
this is captain klaa
of the klingon empire
do not attempt to arm your weapons
or i will destroy you
you are alive for a single reason
the renegade james t kirk
hand him over
and i will spare your lives
im ready to beam him aboard
captain kirk is not among us
you lie
vulcans are incapable of lying
captain kirk is on the planet below
then give me his coordinates
i am in need of your assistance
my assistance
you are his superior officer
i am a foolish old man
damn you sir you will try
klingon commander
someone wishes to speak with you
so its me you want you bastards

our new gunner
spock
welcome aboard captain
i thought i was going to die
not possible you were never alone
please captain

would you care for
a wee nip of scotch whiskey
i never thought
id be drinking with a klingon
what are you two conspiring about
about the progress weve made
she has wonderful muscles
cosmic thoughts gentlemen
we were speculating
is god really out there
maybe hes not out there
maybe hes right here
in the human heart
spock
i was thinking of sybok
i have lost a brother
yes
i lost a brother once
i was lucky i got him back
i thought you said
men like us dont have families
i was wrong
