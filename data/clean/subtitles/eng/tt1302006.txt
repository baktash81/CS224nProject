   cause i love  
  love you so  
  promise i ll never  
  let you go  
  in the still of the night  
  in the still of the night  
  i remember  
  that night in may  
  the stars were bright above  
  i ll hope and i ll pray  
  to keep
your precious love     
when i was young 
i thought house painters painted houses 
what did i know 
i was a working guy 
a business agent for teamster local 107
out of south philly 
one of a thousand working stiffs   
until i wasn t no more 
and then   
i started painting houses   
myself 
in this particular matter 
the whole thing was built
around the wedding 
bill bufalino s daughter
was getting married in detroit 
bill was a teamster lawyer 
but more important 
he was russell bufalino s cousin 
now  russell didn t want to fly 
so i was gonna drive him to the wedding 
he wanted to take care of
some business along the way 
which in russell s case
meant only one thing 
money    collecting it 
so we d drive 
him and his wife carrie
and me and my wife irene 
or i call her reenie 
i figured we would take 476 out of philly 
and then we go up to pittston
and pick up russ 
which is usually how we did it 
and then interstate 80 west
through the rest of pennsylvania 
and then we d go across ohio 
all the way to toledo 
and then we would go 75 north to detroit 
it was gonna take about three days
with all the business breaks
and cigarette stops 
since russell didn t allow
nobody to smoke in the car 
he says jimmy blue eyes and meyer lansky
convinced him to stop smoking
when they were getting kicked out
of their casinos in cuba
and getting shot at by castro 
i don t know 
it might have been one of those 
 please god if i ever get out 
of this fucking thing alive 
i ll never smoke again things too  
but i do know that from castro on 
russ wouldn t allow
nobody to smoke in his car 
not even carrie 
can we stop soon 
we re only in the car two minutes  honey 
we re not even near the highway 
i know  russell 
but you don t like to stop on the highway 
well  it s not that so much 
they don t let you stop on the highway 
okay  so then we ll smoke in the car 
and what about my cataracts 
i ll crack the window 
carrie  i made a vow 
remember 
remember i made a vow  carrie 
yeah 
now i can t smoke on   
all right  and now i can t smoke 
see where we are 
is    is that   
what are those odds 
what s the problem  kid 
i don t    i don t know  it sounds funny 
it stops  it starts  it loses power 
let me see if i can give you a hand 
let me see 
check all these plugs 
spark plugs are okay 
the distributor cap s okay 
good 
it s gotta be something with   
with this 
uh oh  timing chain 
this is what this is  there s a cap on it 
this cap is loose 
it ain t supposed to be loose

okay  frank sheeran 
am i saying that right 
yeah  you said right 
uh  under the contract 
thanks to jimmy hoffa   
management can only fire a driver
on very specific charges 
  so  you ever show up late 
  no 
  do you have any moving violations 
  no 
  do you drink on the job 
  no 
you ever hit anybody 
  on the job 
  yeah 
  no 
  okay 
what about stealing  that ain t grounds 
well   
can they prove it 
i don t think so 
all right then  we don t have
nothing to worry about 
if they can prove it 
they re just gonna want names from you 
accomplices 
that s all  you give them
a couple of names  you go home 
keep your job 
what do you think about that 
  would you give them names 
  no  no names 
you know  i don t  uh   
i don t care whether you did it or not 
that makes no difference to me 
  yeah  i know 
  i m here to defend you  right 
right 
what  you want to know if i did it or not 
well   
i m gonna defend you either way 
yeah  all right  but   
i  i work hard for them
when i ain t stealing from  em 
your honor 
if this was about right or wrong 
the company would have
sought mr  sheeran s dismissal 
they didn t 
they only accused mr  sheeran
because the company hoped
he could name conspirators 
which he couldn t do
because they don t exist 
they don t exist
because he didn t steal anything 
he didn t steal anything
because he s an exemplary employee 
who in eight years
has never taken a day of sick leave 
the only rule he ever broke
is his own union s 
by helping others
carry sides of beef from his truck
to their refrigerators
in the dead of winter 
all rise 
court is in session 
i m dismissing this case
with a warning 
yes  your honor 
no  no  not you  mr  sheeran 
you bring another working man
before this court
with threats instead of evidence 
believe me  you ll be sorry 
if i owned stock in this company 
i would sell it 
i don t know how he did it 
and i ain t gonna ask 
all i know is that bill bufalino
got me out of a case
where i should never
have gotten away with it 
i should ve been down for the count 
people are gonna appreciate
what you did today  frank 
you know  they got families 
they got kids 
they need those jobs 
instead 
we went out celebrating   
russell 
   and i met
what was gonna turn out to be
the rest of my life 
you know  i thought that was you
walking in outside 
yeah  yeah  you know

  thanks  russell 
your cousin saved my ass 
i could ve lost the whole load 
yeah  yeah  well  he knows
everything about trucks  really 
yeah  he worked at canada dry
for a long time 
  vito  how are you 
  pleasure 
i think  uh    let s take the booth 
come on  you re gonna love this 
maybe i didn t know
who russell bufalino was back then 
but i d seen enough pictures and stories
in the newspapers
to know he was eatin  with angelo bruno 
i mean  bruno  he    he was just made
the new boss of philadelphia 
he took care of everything
from philadelphia to atlantic city 
that  i knew 
and that was all i had to know
to know that russell bufalino
was no truck mechanic from canada dry 
this bread is very good 
good  eh 
where did an irisher like you
learn to speak italian 
in italy   the war 
ah  where 
salerno 
anzio 
sicily   
around catania 
catania  i m from catania 
yeah  i thought you had
an accent like catania 
how long were you in the war 
four years 
411 days in combat   
122 at anzio 
forty fifth infantry 
minchia 
  yeah  yeah 
  minchia 
were you afraid of dying 
always afraid 
and don t let anybody
tell you that they weren t afraid 
  that s a lot of bullshit  you know 
  yeah 
everybody s afraid 
and you pray a lot 
i prayed a lot 
i prayed that i d never sin again
as long as i live
if i could just get out of here 
but then the fighting starts
and then you forget about everything 
you re just trying to survive 
stay alive 
once i saw
that i was getting through the war 
i looked around me  i said   
i said   from now on 
whatever happens  happens  
che successe successe 
fuck it 
you know  you got orders  you follow them 
they tell you to bring some prisoners
into    into the woods 
you know 
and they don t tell you what to do   
but they just say  you know   hurry up  
it s crazy  but i never understood
how they would just keep digging
their own graves  you know  i mean   
stop 
raus 
well  i mean 
maybe they thought if they did a good job 
the guy with the gun
would change his mind 
russell 
he    he took a shine to me right away 
after a while 
he started giving me little things to do 
but then angelo himself 
he started giving me
little things to do too 
russ s wife  carrie  her family
goes all the way back  way  way back
to the same town in sicily
as the bufalinos 
they talked about it all the time 
she came from mob royalty 
if you want to call it that 
to them 
it was like they came over on the   
the italian mayflower 
why don t you go upstairs  wash up 
give me those clothes 
i ll get rid of them 
don t forget your shoes  russell 
hey  frank 
can we stop soon

  i got some stops to make 
  okay 
russell had a piece of everything 
he had this store in pittston
called penn drape  amp  curtains 
and he ran everything out of there 
who knew what it all was 
i mean  i m sure the man had partners 
they always have partners 
nobody keeps all the money 
but everybody listened to russ 
that i can tell you 
you wanted to bribe a judge 
you asked russell 
you didn t know how much to bribe him 
russell was gonna tell you 
all right  all right 
uh  i ll be right there 
come on  i ll take care of it 
don t worry about it 
you want to promote
one of your guys 
russ would tell you
you could or you could not 
do me a favor

and just hang around for a while 
these guys keep coming around 
so straighten them out

you gotta go with bruno 
  oh  yeah  yeah  i m on my way 
  yeah  take care 
and when you did something
for russ 
you did it yourself 
like russ used to say   
when i ask somebody
to take care of something for me 
i expect them
to take care of it themselves 
i don t need two roads coming back to me 
when anastasia
got killed in the barbershop 
it was russell they brought in
to calm things down 
so that everybody
wasn t just going around killing everybody
and it could all get straightened out

whispers ditullio

they blew up in that car
around the same time 
this was the other whispers 
the good one who knew how to make money 
i got this place i front money to 
it s a good business 
really good business 
it s a laundry 
what they do is 
they collect the linen  towels 
sheets and everything from all the hotels
and restaurants in atlantic city 
they wash it  they iron it 
normally  it s like a license
to print fucking money 
until recently 
there s this other company
that opened up down in delaware 
they re trying to put us out of business 
they re cutting their prices 
they re scaring our drivers 
they re trying to take
our customers from us 
to tell you the truth 
i m a little concerned 
whenever anybody says
they re a little concerned 
they re very concerned 
as a matter of fact 
i m really more than a little concerned 
and when they say
they re more than a little concerned 
they re desperate 
i want this fucking place bombed 
burnt  torched 
whatever the fuck you have to do 
you were in the war  you know what to do 
leave that fucking place
like you left berlin 
burnt to the fucking ground 
i want them out of fucking business 
who    who are they 
it s the cadillac linen service
in delaware 
it s run by a bunch of jews 
let them collect their insurance 
which i m sure they have plenty 
and leave this fucking other place alone 
the one i m involved in 
  this ain t ten grand 
  it s two grand 
when you put
these jew fucking washerwomen
out of business 
then you get the rest of your money 
the reason i m a little short
on the money right now 
i don t wanna go to skinny 
i don t wanna ask anybody
when they re gonna charge me a vig 
and i m gonna be paying them forever 
i m getting the money somewhere else 
and nobody has to know 
especially not skinny
because i m not getting
the money from him 
and i see you look a little hesitant 
believe me  i know what you can do 
if i stiff you on the money 
you re gonna do something terrible to me 
i do not want that 
i hit the number 
it s about 1 500 
i ll see you in a few hours 
hey  frank 
  hey 
  hey 
angelo wants to see you 
  now

sit down  frank 
what re you doing in delaware 
bombing out a laundry place 
uh  i was just doing a job
to make some extra money 
putting this place out of action 
putting this   
putting this place out of commission 
for who 
now is not the time to not say 
um   
whispers 
the other whispers 
you know who owns
the cadillac linen service 
some jews in the laundry business 
  that s what they told me 
  they own a part of it 
somebody else got an interest in that 
  you know who 
  no 
i do 
  who 
  no  i do 
i own the other part 
not i know somebody
who owns the other part 
angelo  i didn t know
you had any part of it 
i would never have done what i did
if i knew you were involved 
i didn t know 
i would never  never do that against you 
whispers didn t tell you it was jew mob 
no  he said jew washerwomen 
jew washerwomen 
what else he say 
i bet he said keep it to yourself 
don t say nothing to nobody downtown 
he did 
i didn t check 
i m sorry  i should ve checked 
  can i give him his money back 
  he won t need it 
you can keep it 
i    i don t want no trouble 
i ll just give it back to him
and i m okay 
he won t need it 
okay  thanks 
thank russell 
i wouldn t have wasted my time 
i d have let the jew mob have you 
you got a good friend here 
you don t know how good a friend you got 
  oh  i    i know 
  no  you don t know 
wait by the bar  would you 
in a case like this 
the best thing to do is
you use something brand new 
right out of the box 
otherwise  you don t know where it s been 
you don t know who s used it 
what crime it was connected to 
that s suicide 
so i recommend something new 
straight out of the    the box 
stone cold  clean 
  hey 
  hey  there you are 
i didn t know which way
you were coming from 
  huh 
  i didn t know which way

is throw the thing away 
you wanna get rid of it 
there s a spot
in the schuylkill river everybody uses 
if they ever send divers down there 
they d be able to arm a small country 
for me 
everything changed after whispers 
it was like the army 
you followed orders 
you did the right thing 
you got rewarded 
and when i handled things for russell 
it was never for money 
but as a show of respect 
when you ran a little errand 
you did a little favor 
you got a little favor back
if you ever needed it 
and you always hurried back

  well  i do my best 
well  you know  there s a situation   
nowadays  young people 
they don t know who jimmy hoffa was 
they don t have a clue 
i mean  maybe they know
that he disappeared or something 
but that s about it 
but back then  there wasn t nobody
in this country who didn t know
who jimmy hoffa was 
  god bless  jimmy 
  oh 
everything you ve done 
you re a real gentleman 
that s good 
in the  50s 
he was as big as elvis 
in the  60s  he was like the beatles 
next to the president  he was like
the most powerful man in the country 
bar none 
if you got it 
a truck brought it to you 
if you got your food  your clothing 
your medicine 
if you got fuel for your homes 
fuel for your industries 
a truck brought it to them 
the day our trucks stop 
america stops 
well  there s a situation
going on now  frank 
that needs to be attended to 
you know 
they re trying to tear the union apart 
big business and the government
working together  trying to pull us down 
big business
is on the attack 
they re coming  they re coming hard
and they re coming fast 
big business and the government
are trying to sow the seeds of dissent
among our ranks 
at a time when we need unity 
we need solidarity 
i want to write it in the sky 
solidarity 
solidarity 
solidarity 
you wanna be
a part of this fight 
yes  i do  sir 
would you like to be
a part of this history

all right  then  see you then 
  he likes to talk  don t he 
  yeah 
thought i was talking to general patton 
you know  frank 
the only reason why you re here 
the seafarers union 
they re signing up
the same non union cab drivers
as we want to do 
nobody knows who you are
and nobody knows
what the fuck you re doing here  okay 
  yeah 
  you and i know why you re here 
we gotta be able to sign these drivers up
so paul hall doesn t get  em
for his fucking union 
for some reason  lesbians 
most of these drivers
are fucking lesbians 
i have no reason why 
paul hall s running around saying
that he s gonna get a better contract
than our boy fucking jimmy 
he s a cocksucker  yeah 
jimmy has mayor fucking daley
in his pocket 
the cops are okay
with whatever the fuck we do 
they re not gonna help us
push these cars in 
but they certainly are not gonna
let anybody fucking stop us 
okay 
come on  all of you guys 
come on 
let s get this fucking thing in there 
watch yourself 
this is a lot of work 
yeah  you ever think of using candy 
  what 
  candy 
what the fuck is candy 
hey  lou  open the fucking gate 
i got it  i got it 
here  you take the gas 
frank  there s one thing
about jimmy 
don t ever make him wait 
if you make a meeting with him 
you get there on time 
better yet  get there early 
i can t stress this enough 
his problem is that time is of essence 
and that s the important thing 
i gotta tell you one more thing 
jimmy doesn t drink 
yeah  the head of the largest
trucking union in the world 
he don t drink 
the worst part about it is 
he doesn t allow anybody
to drink around him 
another thing about him 
jimmy hates fucking watermelon 
but we re gonna like watermelon 
jimmy  you shoulda seen it 
sinking in the water 
one by one 
i bet you  when they woke up
the next morning 
those fucking cab drivers 
they went to look for their cabs 
they didn t know what the fuck hit  em 
that s a great idea  joey 
great idea 
well  it wasn t my idea 
my man frank  it was his idea 
let me tell you something 
frank hit that pier 
he took over the pier 
whatever he told them to do 
whatever he said 
they did it  you know 
i never seen a guy walk
through a crowd like he does 
he doesn t touch a fucking person 
everybody gets out of the way 
i m not kidding you  i swear 
guys he never met in his life 
you know  it was like   
like moses  remember moses 
when he walked into the ocean 
the sea 
whatever the fuck it was 
and it opened up 
that s him  i m telling you 
jimmy  he s got it 
so  uh  what do you think 
you need him
a couple of days more 
yeah  we gotta clear up
a few dribs and drabs 
you guys sure like watermelon 
want a bite 
not on your life 
you were there  you saw it firsthand 
those guys ain t union 
they re like nazi collaborators 
operating behind the lines 
  you know  you were in the war 
  i sure do 
in a war 
you go from point a to point b 
sometimes 
you spill a little beer along the way 
that philosophy make sense to you 
sure does 
good 
jimmy  he didn t make me
stay in his suite
because he liked me 
he made me stay with him
because he didn t want me
registering in my name at the hotel 
this way  there was no proof
i was even in chicago 
come on  jimmy  you re way behind 
nothing stops her 
after chicago 
jimmy and i got close 
the wives hit it off 
and with jimmy and josephine s kids
mostly grown up and out of the house 
they got a kick out of our kids too 
jimmy  peggy  let s get a picture 
oh  yes  come on 
especially peggy 
she and jimmy 
they fell for each other right away 
you know what i like even better
than getting my picture took 
what 
surprise 
peggy 
to peggy  jimmy wasn t like russ 
or skinny or even me 
sorry  everybody 
this is just for peggy and i 
for one thing 
jimmy didn t have a nickname
like  the razor   or  the hunchback  
or  the weasel   or  whispers  
so what happened to  thank you  
  thank you 
  oh 
and also  to her 
he was helping people 
he was helping them
make more money  live better lives 
he wasn t stomping on somebody s hand 
  if you have it 
a truck brought it to you  
this is what mr  hoffa says 
he s the president of the teamsters union
with over a million members 
they all support him
because they have steady jobs 
great pay and a pension
for when they retire 
the teamster pension fund
had eight billion dollars in it 
and jimmy had complete control
over every bit of it 
isn t this
a beautiful presentation 
i mean  a bridge loan is really
all i m asking  jimmy 
i m not gonna piss away
my members  pension dough
on something too risky 
this is not a risk  jimmy 
i got minsky s follies 
i got the first topless act on the strip 
i m telling you  we re booming in there 
i can t get the drinks out   
just asking for a golf course 
you know you never lost a dime with me 
jimmy  we d really just appreciate
whatever you could do
to help jake along here 
one five is all i need
for a completion bond 
okay  okay  go to the bank 
thank you 
it s gonna be a big success 
thank you  jimmy  you re a prince 
  you re a mensch 
  yeah  i m a mensch 
and  because of mr  hoffa 
workers have medical insurance
for when they get sick 
and know when they retire 
they re not going to go hungry 
there was
so much paperwork back then
that jimmy had to use
an insurance company
that was run by this kid  allen dorfman 
to work out the loans 
no  no  nothing for nothing 
next time 
try asking a little bit fucking nicer 
and  and  how d it go 
it was a little touch and go
for a little bit 
  but at the end  fine 
  good 
it was russ who got jimmy
to give guys like gottlieb the loans 
and  you know 
he would get like 10  of that 
or whatever  you know  maybe more 
listen  you tell marteduzzo
from me that i appreciate it 
and everybody s gonna appreciate it 
it s a good thing 
okay  i ll do that 
back then 
you couldn t go to regular banks
because the money was for gambling 
god s truth  that s what it was 
i m serious  you couldn t 
so the mob  what did they do 
they went to the teamsters
for the money 
it was the teamsters that stepped in
and lent the money that built las vegas 
  this is the mahogany   
  don t  billy 
  don t touch the stuff 
  i won t 
  just go where you gotta go 
  okay 
there was more business
than anybody could handle 
so jimmy had to shove
some of the deals
off on to his wife jo 
who had no idea she had 22 
of a florida land deal
called  sun valley  
some charter fishing boats 
and a ski lodge with its own mountain 
one of jimmy s clients
was sam  momo  giancana 
who was friends with the kennedys
from back when jack s father
made his fortune with the italians
as a bootlegger during prohibition 
momo  sinatra hung out together
with the kennedys 
momo and kennedy 
believe it or not 
even had the same girlfriend 
together  at the same time 
talk about crazy 
so it was easy for the mob
to help joe kennedy
get his son elected president 
that was easy 
they just punched up the vote a little
to make sure that he won in illinois 
in exchange for that 
the new president was supposedly
gonna get castro out of cuba
so our guys could get their casinos back 
and race tracks  and shrimp boats 
and everything else that they had 
and owned down there from havana back 
but that    that didn t happen 
the italians wanted kennedy
the irishman for president 
and that s what they got 
get used to it 
because we re gonna be seeing it 24 7 
son of a bitch 
goddamn kennedys 
i m looking at the goddamn kennedys 
jimmy  the kids  language 
oh  what difference does it make 
i mean  they gotta learn sooner or later 
we re going to war with these people 
war 
if i said it once 
i said it a thousand times 
i don t care they re irish 
i don t care they re catholic 
if there s one person
you can t trust in this life 
it s millionaires  kids 
you re right  jimmy 
especially that little son of a bitch 
are you saying you don t remember
doing any favors for johnny dio 
or you don t remember
the conversation 
i m saying 
to the best of my recollection 
i must recall on my memory 
i cannot remember 
then where did this  20 000 come from 
individuals 
which individuals  mr  hoffa 
uh   
off hand  that particular amount of money
i borrowed 
i don t know at this particular moment 
but the record of my loans 
which i requested  i have 
and out of all the moneys i loaned
during this period of time
i went into these ventures 
those goddamn kennedys 
they get what they want 
jimmy  jimmy  the kids 
him and all the bullshit problems
  he put me through already 
  jimmy 
i gotta go 
you don t expect me to look at this 
no  i don t 
  whoa 
  for guys like russ 
it couldn t have been better 
i mean  russ 
oh  yeah  he did his part
for getting kennedy elected 
that s for sure 
what are you doing 
i told you to put it   
i told you to put them on every pole 
you re still walking around 
so what s the first thing
that jack kennedy does
to thank chicago for all their help 
he puts his shitass brother in there 
that little prep school punk 
and he winds up making him
attorney general 
oh 
and what s the first thing bobby does 
he goes after not just jimmy 
which in a way you could understand 
i mean  jimmy hated the kennedys so much
he gave nixon  500 000 in teamster cash 
but bobby also goes after giancana 
marcello  trafficante 
and all the other guys
who put his brother in the white house
in the first place 
what s that about 
frank 
  oh  thank you 
  merry christmas 
am i missing something 
thank you  carrie 
  that s gorgeous 
  beautiful 
wear it in the best of health 
we love you 
okay  now this one is for peggy
from uncle russell 
merry christmas  my love 
oh  look at those 
so nice 
i heard you like to skate 
what do you say

i think santa claus left you
a little something extra in there too 
what do you say
to uncle russell 
what do you say 
huh 
frank  it s all right 
she said thank you once 
that s enough 
with bobby as attorney general 
i mean  they were all over us 
i mean  we couldn t talk on the phone
because we knew it was being bugged 
you couldn t do nothing 
you couldn t go nowhere 
you couldn t do anything 
it was a bad  bad  bad situation 
and then jimmy    forget it 
bobby  now as attorney general 
he has the power
to send anybody to jail 
and no question about it 
and jimmy was at the top
of bobby s hit list 
he even set up
a special  get hoffa squad  
where he had his own guys from the fbi 
the irs working  round the clock 
their only job
was to put jimmy hoffa in jail 
i m serious  that s all they did 
i am sitting in a room
full of fuckin  idiots 
you dumb motherfuckers 
you know what you did 
you take johnny o rourke s kid
and you put him on
as general organizer

all over the place
and they miss the big picture

like getting rid
of that fucking castro prick 
the old timers spoke to the old man 
the old man talked to his son jack 
and he told him

what are you looking at

so there s no need for anyone
looking at my ears anymore 
yeah  well  i ain t looking at your ears 
right 
get out of here  go on 
unfolded in the bay of pigs 
nothing went as planned 
paratroopers were unable
to blow up roadways
leading to the beach area 
castro raced toward the scene 
the underground might have blown up
the roads but it knew nothing 
soon  castro had artillery
firing on the beachhead 
his planes destroyed invading ships
carrying a brigade of men
and vital ammunition 
the beachhead could not be enlarged
and paratroopers were soon
trying to fight their way back
to the small section of the shore
where the invaders were pinned down 
1 500 men had been dumped
on a shore without air cover
or protective fire from ships 
castro had to wait
only until they ran out of ammunition
before mopping them up 
later  castro was to strut around
the invasion area with newsmen 
and expound on the errors
that had been made 
he had ample material 
the united states  already humiliated 
stood condemned
by most of the countries of the world 
 ah  shit 
just as i predicted  they fuck up cuba 
boobie starts coming after me
and the union 
he s looking for some cheap publicity 
that s all it is 
that s what he s doing 
okay 
well  it s all gonna blow over  jimmy 
no  it s not gonna blow over 
how s it gonna blow over 
they re never gonna forget
  that i gave money to nixon 
  calm down  jimmy  please 
we re gonna handle this 
couple of the old timers 
they re gonna get to old man kennedy now 
okay  they re gonna get to him 
he s a little sick  but   
  sick 
  yeah  but   
he had a fucking stroke 
that s not sick 
that s you re   
you re close to the grave  is what 
he s turning into a fucking eggplant 
okay  well  you can t blame
anybody for that  that s   
i m not looking to blame anybody 
but if there s any blame going around 
it s the kennedys 
his kids killed him  let me tell you that 
he s not dead  but he s going 
he s going 
they killed him 
they d give anybody a heart attack 
where are you going 
i m going to work 
go back to sleep 
all i can say is that 
we will not stop 
because we ve been
doing that for 50 years 
what good does it do 
let the lawyers   
let the lawyers drive a truck 
they need their pencils
and papers and their ink pads 
that s    that s a whole other story 
but we re gonna get through this 
we re gonna get through
this legal bullshit
and garbage they re throwing at us 
we re gonna get through it because
 boobie  kennedy wants something 
that doesn t mean
the rich boy is gonna get it 
you understand what i m saying 
i don t care what he wants 
he s not gonna get it 
he s not gonna get it because
we are the biggest and best 
and most honest union
in this country 
yeah  that s right 
i waited for that 
and you know the operative word
i m talking about here 
  solidarity 
  yeah 
and it works  it works for all of us 
and it works for our friend here

well  you re not knocking him 
just tell me

uh  he s a nice guy 
but he ain t that sharp 
he ain t that smart 
and he s also like a   
he plays a lot of fucking golf

that s what you want from a number two 
you don t want somebody too smart

  not at all  not at all 
i mean  i told you how i felt about fitz 
pro  you know

i m the only one
who sees right through that cocksucker 
  so let s raise a glass     
  he s a bad guy 
  he s a bad guy 
  to the greatest guy  
  560 is lucky enough to ever have  
  you re our boy  
  tony pro  
  we re all yours  
the little guy
was tony provenzano 
they called him tony pro 
he was a capo in a big jersey crew
and the president of the local 560
in union city  new jersey 
  he s the greatest guy  
  560 is lucky enough to ever have  
tony  tony  tony 
tony  tony  tony 
tony  tony  tony 
pro and jimmy 
they came up together
and they were close    for a while 
you turl  you work 
while the corporation kings
and princes of industry 
with their vast expense accounts
and salary and luxurous yachts 
have dedicated themselves
to our destruction 
down on them 
i didn t need nobody
to tell me about tony pro 
oh  no  what did i need to know 
i knew enough 
this is a man
who had sally bugs strangle
tony  three fingers  castellito
just because three fingers
was coming up big in the union 
and it was his own guy 
it was his own guy 
tony pro was so fucking worried
that this guy was gonna beat him out
that after he had sally bugs
strangle the guy 
he had sally stick him
in a fucking tree shredder 
that way there d be no competition 
not even from the grave 
he s out of control 
what are you gonna do
with a person like this 
he s got a hand in everybody s pocket 
shaking down the trucking companies 
can you imagine that 
threatening people 
i mean  you know

your honor 
my client had been advised by counsel
that it was perfectly legal for his wife
to be part owner of a trucking business 
still  when the mcclellan committee
challenged its legality 
she withdrew from the company
immediately 
that should be the end of the matter 
there had been not one indictment served
against my client
in 13 grand jury investigations 
your honor  this is an example of
a personal vendetta against my client 
against his family 
by a frustrated justice department
and the attorney general  robert kennedy 
whoa 
he s got a gun 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
get that gun out of his hand 
easy  boy 
that was not a real gun  was it 
how d that gun get in 
how d it get in here

i don t know 
oh  my chuckie 
hey  it s my son 
that s my kid  i raised this kid 
you see him  you see what he did 
i ll tell you this 
he shot at me 
and it was like a pellet or something 
i didn t feel it 
i just felt a little impact 
like i was shot not even with a bb gun 
something even lighter 
but i charged him 
i charged him and so did chuckie 
if you noticed 
i taught him well 
you charge a guy 
always charge a guy with a gun 
with a knife  you run away 
run away from a knife 
so you charge with a gun 
  with a knife  you run 
  that s right

i don t know he changed the deal 
but it was my understanding
over the telephone that brennan
was speaking for himself 
she s an angry woman 
that s an angry woman 
  oh

of intercepting it
or issuing a warning about it

 cause i gotta cut hoffa in on the deal  
is that accurate  sir 
this one s another possibility

of having tampered
with the very soul of this nation

that jury thing in nashville 
the soul of this nation  sir 
lies in its sacred processes of justice 
justice must be done 
and for your wicked attempts
to corrupt these processes 
justice will be done on you 
we got him now 
we got him 
ladies and gentlemen  we did it 
but jimmy  you know 
he had it all set up 
although you knew
it was supposed to look like fitz
was the one in charge 
he gave fitz his orders
through bill bufalino and allen dorfman 
and they ran jimmy s loans

as much as jimmy

everybody else liked him because

drawing attention to himself
and everybody  what is that 
who does he think he is  erroll flynn 
he went against
everything and everybody 
just didn t give a shit 
and  growing up 
he kidnapped his own bosses 
i don t know how he got away with that 
you don t get away with that 
you do that  you die 
that simple 
when he went away to the can 
he recruited black guys
instead of his own kind 
and when he got out 
nobody knew what he was doing 
or who he was doing with it 
we didn t know what the hell
was going on  nobody did 
and if you don t like what he s doing 
and you say something 
then you see what happens 
who does something like that 
who does things like that 
i ll tell you  i ll tell you 
sta test e cazzu 
this disgraziato 
him and oswald  two of a kind 
at least in dallas 
the kids weren t there 
it was just jackie 
joey  your doctor called 
you died an hour ago 
you a jewish fellow 
would you like to be 
don t worry about the operation 
we don t do that no more 
we freeze it 
and you stand there
and don t do anything
and a mexican broad
comes over with a wet rock 
thwack

happy birthday  joey 
hey  russ 
hey  what are you doing with that 
you really believe
in that bullshit league 
well  it s not that 
it s italian 
joey  joey 
  what did i say 
  oh  no  no 
  what did i say 
  joey  joey  joey  joey 
now  listen 
you can t say that stuff like that here 
okay  you can t do that 
why not  rickles is the only one
who can make jokes 
the man s a boss 
so i m a boss  he s a boss 
we re all supposed to be brothers  right 
i know you re a boss 
i know  but we don t wanna
have a beef now  okay 
  we re brothers  right 
  that s right  brothers 
  we re brothers

i m not  but you guys are 
so that s why
i would like it if you just   
  all right 
  okay 
  we re brothers 
  you re brothers 
oh  yeah  it s my birthday 
happy birthday 
happy birthday 
get the fuck out of here 
now  for something like this 
you re gonna need two guns 
the one you re gonna use
and a backup 
you want something with more
stopping power than a  22 
you definitely don t want a silencer 
you want to make a lot of noise
to make the witnesses run away
so they ain t gonna be looking at you 
but not the noise a  45 makes
 cause that makes too much noise 
and a patrol car can hear it
a few blocks away at least 
the cops call a  32 a woman s gun
because it s easier to handle
and don t do the damage a  38 does 
but  you know  it does enough 
 it would be late 
so the tourists from idaho
wouldn t be there 
they d be in bed 
and him being down there in little italy 
maybe he d be more comfortable 
more relaxed 
it was his birthday
so he d be there with his wife
and his kid which  in this case 
that s good
because that s the point 
they should have to see what it s like 
he d already been drinking 
which would have slowed him down a lot 
his bodyguard would be with him
and joey himself could be carrying  too 
but then the piece would be
in his wife s purse probably 
you never got
a lot of advance notice 
all you knew was your part of it 
john the redhead knew only one thing 
he was gonna drop me off 
circle the block and pick me up 
you wanna take out the bodyguard first 
not kill him 
don t kill him  just disable him 
you got no argument with him 
so  not in the face or the chest 
sometimes  with something like this 
you might want to go
to the bathroom first 
it gives you a chance to make sure
nobody followed you in 
it also gives you a chance to make sure
nobody is in the bathroom
you have to worry about 
it also gives you a chance
to go to the bathroom 
you don t want to be uncomfortable 
but i went before 
and in a place this small  this late 
you might as well just get to work 
we need more wine  all right 
hey  tommy  some more wine 
so how about after 
  cake  cake  cake 
  not yet 
you re not even done eating the meal yet 
you want the cake 
come on  you can t do that 
shit 
fuck  fuck 
it happened
in new york s little italy 
an area rumored to be neutral territory
among mobsters 
after the killing

jimmy  listen 
as soon as you re back as president 
you can do anything you want to 
you can fire anybody you want to 
you can even fire tony pro

i mean  who talks like that
about a person s grandchildren 
  it s not fucking right 
  no 
but pro isn t nobody 
jimmy should know that 
hey  what am i gonna go 
i m not gonna tell this guy
what he can or can t fucking say 
like he s a child 
well  listen 
jimmy don t mean nothing 
he just gets upset 
russ  come on 
we all know he s a fucking hothead 
we re all hotheads once in a while 
yeah  but jimmy says things
he shouldn t say sometimes 
yeah  we all do that too 
well  somebody should just calm him down 
yeah  well  that    i m gonna   
i m gonna calm him down 
he s difficult  but   
maybe this could help him calm down 
you could tell him
that i always liked him 
huh 
and i won t stand in his way
of him trying to get his job back 
i will  i will tell him that  tony 
  okay 
  yes 
that s not making me calm down 
standing by me 
what the fuck does that mean 
standing by me ain t the same thing
as doing something
about some out of control
fucking psycho 
jimmy  the little guy ain t a nobody 
you gotta understand that 
  he ain t a nobody 
  he s a cocksucker 
fitz is a cocksucker 
i m gonna deal
with both these cocksuckers   
myself 
this used to be my office 
go look for frank fitzsimmons there 
you re not gonna find him 
that s because he travels
all over the country
looking for goddamn golf courses
because that s what he does 
he plays golf 
who is he to run around with nixon 
run around with the attorney general 
he does this and collects full time salary
while he s doing it 
now  how do you do that 
there s not enough hours
in a day to do this job 
i was sent to prison for fraud 
this is fraud  what he s doing 
so what s fitz s answer to jimmy 
he does it by sending a message
to jimmy s old friend  dave johnson 
now  dave johnson  he ran local 299 
this was the message 
so this is how
fitz says he wants my old pal dave johnson
to step down so he can have his son
take over local 299 
this is how i m gonna say no to his son 
little fucking fitz 
she looked a lot like your mother 
  about the same size 
  pops  come on  you told me   
good looking girl 
she was a good looking girl 
but i had no idea
that it wasn t your mother 
it was dark and   
this is how
fitz says he doesn t like
who i say runs the 299 
by firing my wife from her
forty eight fucking thousand 
dollar a year union job 
son of a bitch  fuck him 
he had
previously taped the locks
on the entry door
of the basement of the watergate   
  what are you looking at 
  uh  it s   
it s big ears 
he had noticed
that the tape had been removed 
and he re taped the door 
big ears 
that s  uh   
somebody i met a long time ago  just   
his ears ain t so big 
   at that point 
i said  let us junk it  
meaning let us scrap the operation 
mr  liddy and mr  mccord
talked between themselves
and the decision was made to go 
i thought it was very foolhardy   
so  frank fitzsimmons 
in your opinion 
should he remain
president of the teamsters 
absolutely not 
frank fitzsimmons
has sold his union out
to his underworld pals 
the mob controls him 
which means it controls our pension fund 
i m talking about a billion dollars
in low or no interest loans
this man has given to known racketeers
for their illegal enterprises 
not anymore 
it s time for the rats to abandon ship 
is he serious 
not jimmy  this is all publicity 
he s running for office 
he s putting on a show 
yeah  it s all puff 
it s got no substance  nothing 
maybe he means what he says 
  tony  he s campaigning 
  russ 
he s liable to say any fucking thing 
i don t care
if he s campaigning 
he can t talk like that 
it s no fucking good 
  i understand what you re saying 
  you know what he should do  russ 
he should cash in that big pension of his 
spend more time with his grandchildren 
he got a beautiful family  no 
yeah  yeah  yeah  right 
maybe he should relax 
word should get back to him 
i    i just wanna say   
i don t want you
to take this the wrong way 
but there i was with some people
and they were saying 
and you know who they are   
they were saying   
 please tell jimmy we love the guy  
we don t want any problem 
we just think that he should   
maybe enjoy his grandchildren 
 enjoy his pension  enjoy his life as is  
go no further  frank 
who said it 
  it don t matter who said it 
  oh  it matters 
  was it russell  no 
  no 
of course it s not russell

oh 
this guy is not even the goddamn president
and he s holding up people s loans

the add on that we re doing at caesars 
  and what s fitz doing all this time 
  fitz 
yeah  he s supposed to help
with this shit 
the money comes
from the pension fund trustees 
they gotta sign off on it 
they re supposed to be rubber stamping
what fitz says 
  right  right  yeah 
  except jimmy

to stop rubber stamping 
the son of a bitch 
i thought we took care of that 
you know
what he told somebody 
he goes  once fitz is out and he s in 
he s gonna call in the old loans 
hotels  casinos  real estate

   cause better times are here to stay  
  oh  yesterday is over  
  tomorrow s on its way  
  but look what s new
and made for you today  
  today  
you don t need money  do you 
it s not about money 
oh  if it s not about money 
then i m really having
trouble understanding 
because i don t know
what all the talk is about 
it s my union 
  is that hard to understand 
  no  no 
it s your union  that s right 
it ll always be your union 
you could step down and still run it 
no  you don t step down 
what do you mean 
russ  you don t step down
to run a union 
you step down to go to your grave 
well  listen

i can t help but think  i m sorry 
but is there another reason or something 
this is my union 
what do you mean   another reason

and then try to understand things 
listen  some people 
not me  but some people

a failure to show appreciation

about his woes  his problems 
and all i wanted to do
was finish my ice cream in peace 
this cocksucker

wearing fucking shorts 
  who wears shorts to a meeting

i m not showing appreciation

some people say
i m not showing appreciation 
well  then fuck them 
i m trying to help you  jim 
i know you are 
but nobody threatens hoffa 
  the time is now  
  the time is now  
  the time is now  
he has done it as a driver

it s most arrests on the picket line 
twenty six times
in 24 hours  beating my record

 james hoffa 
former president of the teamsters union 
disappeared on wednesday 
and as of tonight 
no trace of him has been found 
hoffa spent four years   
in prison and made no bones
  about his intention   
  frank 
to get the presidency back
from his successor  frank fitzsimmons 
fitzsimmons  son
is the vice president of   
  still nothing 
  uh uh 
   young fitzsimmons  car
was bombed  he was not in it 
but there is bad blood
in the detroit local 
hoffa disappeared
wednesday afternoon 
now  more than 48 hours later 
with no word yet
on what happened to hoffa 
police are extremely concerned 
authorities are most anxious
to find whom hoffa
was supposed to meet
outside the red fox restaurant
where he was last seen 
police think it could have been
a man named anthony giacalone 
described as a big man
in the detroit mafia 
hoffa s son  james 
tried to contact giacalone today 
but didn t succeed 
hoffa s family and friends stayed
in the family home in lake orion today   
i should call jo 
you haven t called jo yet 
why 
what 
why 
why what 
why haven t you called jo 
has anybody come forward
with a ransom demand
or anything like that 
uh  not as of yet 
do you think
the abduction was for ransom 
i m gonna call her now 
do you think the abduction
had anything to do
with the recent conflicts
within local 299  his own local 
i think the union politics
is certainly something
that has to be investigated 
one high official
of the teamsters international
says he fears the worst 
that hoffa may have been killed 
robert hager  nbc news 
bloomfield  michigan 
at a truck stop
outside detroit 
where hoffa rose to the top
in the teamsters union 
truck drivers had a variety of theories   
she stopped talking to me
that day 
august 3rd  1975 
she s got a good job now
and lives just outside philly 
but my daughter   
peggy   
disappeared   
from my life that day 
hello 
  hello 
  hello 
jo  jo 
it s    it s   
  frank  frank 
  yeah  yeah 
  yeah  um   
  i don t   
  look  i   
  frank   
do you think   
do you think he s alive 
he s gotta be 
you know  you gotta think positively 
it s just  you know  it ain t that long 
it s just   
but do you    
do you know he s okay 
no  no  no  i mean  you know me  i   
he maybe did something
like the joe bananas thing 
where  you know 
he had himself kidnapped
and then came back 
but he wasn t hurt  nothing happened 
maybe he   
maybe he just felt  you know 
he wanted to clear his head a bit 
but you gotta just think
that it s gonna be   
it s gonna be okay 
it s gonna be okay 
he s gonna be   
if you need anything  i m here for you 
anything  anything 
can you just   
can you call me again 
yeah  i ll call    i ll call you 
yeah  i ll    i ll call you 
i ll check in with you tomorrow 
yes  call me tomorrow 
okay  i ll call you in the morning  okay 
promise 
don t worry  be strong 
be positive  huh 
okay  jo  okay  okay 
okay 
  okay 
  talk to ya a little later  bye 
  bye 
  goodbye  frank 
it was no more complicated than that 
mr  sheeran 
do you know who  if anyone 
was behind the disappearance
of james hoffa 
everybody who ever had
anything to do with jimmy
was hauled in and questioned 
on the advice of counsel 
i respectfully decline
to answer that question
on the grounds
that it might tend to incriminate me 
okay  let me ask you this 
what color is my pen 
and everybody took the fifth 
i mean  in that situation 
that s what you do 
what else are you gonna do 
still  everybody got indicted or convicted
on one thing or another 
but not that 
not about jimmy 
nobody  as you know 
even went to jail for that 
and nobody talked  which is unusual 
 cause usually 
three people can keep a secret
only when two of them are dead 
bruno denzetta and marco rossi 
they got 20 years each
for shaking down a trucking company 
pro was convicted with them 
but he was already back in school
for that other matter
i talked about before 
well  you remember
that poor union treasurer 
tony  three fingers  
who got more votes than pro 
they got him on that 
sally bugs  you know  he did that one 
one day  bugs was seen
walking into the federal building 
what he did itself
ain t no crime 
i mean  a lot of people
get called in for things 
but sally knows better 
how come he didn t say anything
to anybody 
he didn t tell anybody one word 
not one word 
and one thing for sure 
he didn t go there for fucking lunch 
sally 
  what s good 
  hey  irish 
turns out sally did tell somebody
he had to go in there for something 
they just forgot to tell somebody else 
so it was a bad hit 
jimmy s son  chuckie 
you know  his foster son 
was in the thing  too 
but he didn t know it 
all chuckie knew
was he was pickin  up
one of pro s guys and me 
and we was all gonna pick up his dad
at the red fox for a meeting 
well  i mean  he was in it  yeah 
you could say that  but stupidly 
i    i always felt sorry
for chuckie in this whole thing 
and i    i still do 
and the feds gave him ten months
for some bullshit thing about a car 
and that s about it 
who knows what the fuck   
fat tony salerno 
they got on an income tax thing 
a little while after 
he was diagnosed with prostate cancer 
there s a    a pork store up in  uh   
northern california 
uh  right around   
walnut creek 
you re from up there  ain t you 
  yeah 
  yeah 
and you might even know
the guy that runs it 
actually 
i m looking for a little favor   
for him  not for me 
but if you can get him a ticket 
like  to australia   
you know what i mean 
yeah 
you want to help him get down there 
ye    yeah 
now  russell  he got pinched
for telling jimmy the weasel
to strangle jack napoli
over some beef
about 25 grand of jewelry
that jack took on credit
from russell and then he never paid for 
now  with russ  you don t do that 
so  only thing is  the weasel  he flipped 
he had a wire on him 
they called it
 conspiracy to kill a witness  
it was obvious to everybody else
that napoli was clearly in the wrong 
i mean  how could you not see that 
he set him up  it was entrapment 
what else could you call it 
but that s another thing
i don t wanna get into now  
raise your right hand 
they brought me up on bribery
and labor racketeering charges
and some other bullshit things
i don t know 
   the truth  the whole truth
and nothing but the truth 
  so help you god 
  i do 
did you also tell them that mr  boffa
had given you and your wife
luxury vehicles 
mr  cole  i worked for 44 years 
i never took one dime illegal
off boffa or nobody else 
you can think whatever you wanna think 
don t matter to me 
but all they got me for was
blowing up a crane company
that fired two of my shop stewards
for no good reason 
and    and my lincoln 
i mean 
i bought that car from eugene boffa 
he leased truck drivers
to freight companies 
and then he paid them substandard wages 
they said i paid a lot less for the car
than what it was worth 
they said the car was a bribe 
i    i    i loved that car 
but it wasn t worth the 18 years
they gave me for it 
that s for sure 
russell  he had a stroke 
fat tony  he couldn t control
his urine no more 
and my arthritis
that started in the foxholes of anzio
was eatin  away at my lower back now 
and i couldn t feel much
in my feet no more 
i needed a cane 
but  you know  they re not gonna
give you a cane in the can
because they say
you re gonna use it as a weapon 
there was this medicine  neurontin 
it helped me a little bit 
but it also made you loopy 
he s got it 
  he s got it 
  ah 
we were all falling apart
right there
in the freezing fucking cold 
  i can see it from here 
  you getting scared now 
yeah  you stay here
another fucking ten years 
you ll beat me 
is this the good grape juice 
i can t eat it 
  take a bite 
  i got no teeth  i can t 
put a little piece 
just a little piece  thank you 
that s it 
  e buono  no 
  buono 
buono 
jimmy was a good man 
you know 
he had a nice family too  huh 
yeah 
  yeah 
  i know 
i never wanted it to go that far 
i picked us over him 
fuck  em 
fuck  em 
fuck  em 
mangia che cresci    figlio mio  mangia 
hey  russ 
hey  frankie 
  where you goin  
  what 
  where you goin  
  i m going to church 
church 
don t laugh  you ll see 
don t laugh 
you ll see 
russell went to church 
then he went to the prison hospital 
and  uh   
and then he went to the graveyard 
lord jesus christ  by your own   
 i got out that october 
reenie died in december 
on december 23rd  to be exact 
lung cancer 
no surprise 
   even as it claims
our mortal bodies 
grant that our sister
may sleep here in peace 
until you awaken her to glory 
for you are the resurrection
and the life 
and then she will see you face to face 
and in your light will see light 
and know the splendor of god
for ever and ever  amen 
   six points shy
of his career average of  296
coming into this season 
top four batters in this lineup for
philadelphia today are all switch hitters 
much to the frustration
of some policy makers 
nato military leaders will not risk
low flying attacks
on serb troops in kosovo 
it could take days more
of systematic bombing  especially since
the serbs have hidden so many
of their anti aircraft missiles 
in essence  daring nato to fly low 
you go    you go there  yeah  yeah 
yeah  yeah 
peggy 
peggy  i just want to talk 
i just  you know    i   
she walked away 
i know she s mad at me and all 
but i    i want   
call her  call her 
i just want to talk to her 
talk to her and tell her what 
what   
i just want to say i m sorry  that s all 
for 
look   
i know i wasn t a    a good dad 
i know that 
i know that 
i was just trying to protect her 
protect all of youse 
i mean  that s what i was doing 
that s   
from what 
well  everything 
i mean   
you    youse had
a sheltered life  in a way 
because you didn t see what i see
and what i ve been through 
there s a lot of bad people out there 
what else am i gonna do 
daddy  you have no idea
what it was like for us 
i mean  we couldn t go to you
with a problem
 cause of what you would do 
you know 
we couldn t come to you for protection
because of the terrible things
that you would do 
i was just    i was   
i didn t want to see
youse get hurt  that s all 
um   
i know you read a lot of things about me 
heard about me 
i m sorry 
i    um   
can i do anything now
to make it up to you 
huh 
if you re looking for something
with a little bit more luxury 
we have these two models
over here 
they re like the cadillacs of caskets 
now  if we puttin  you
in the fuckin  oven 
it really doesn t matter what you go in 
the cheapest shit possible 
particle board  that s it 
what are we doin  today 
are we doin  a cremation 
  a burial 
  burial 
uh  is it for a man or for a woman 
me 
shit 
you see anything you like 
uh   
  that green one 
  that s a beauty 
that one ll set you back about  7 500
if you take it home today 
what do you think 
can you do any better 
i mean  buddy

on that for you  how about that 
  six flat cash work for you 
  that s good 
good for me 
sooner or later 
everybody put here has a date
when he s gonna go 
that s just the way it is 
and i think there s gotta be
something when you go
 cause  i mean  how the hell
did this whole thing start 
people smarter than me
can t figure it out 
that s why i would never go for cremation
because it s so   
it s so final 
this    this one 
1948 
that s the hardest part
of anybody when they bury youse 
is when they go into the ground
because it s   
it s so final 
if you go into a building 
the building s there 
the crypt is there 
it has to be a metal casket 
and they have you in the room 
and all that there 
it s just not as final  you re dead 
but it ain t that final
