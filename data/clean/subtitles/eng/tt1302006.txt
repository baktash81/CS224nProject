cause i love
love you so

let you go
in the still of the night
in the still of the night
i remember
that night in may
the stars were bright above
ill hope and ill pray
to keep
your precious love
when i was young
i thought house painters painted houses
what did i know
i was a working guy
a business agent for teamster local 107
out of south philly
one of a thousand working stiffs
until i wasnt no more
and then
i started painting houses
myself
in this particular matter
the whole thing was built
around the wedding
bill bufalinos daughter
was getting married in detroit
bill was a teamster lawyer
but more important
he was russell bufalinos cousin
now russell didnt want to fly
so i was gonna drive him to the wedding
he wanted to take care of
some business along the way
which in russells case
meant only one thing
money collecting it
so wed drive
him and his wife carrie
and me and my wife irene
or i call her reenie
i figured we would take 476 out of philly
and then we go up to pittston
and pick up russ
which is usually how we did it
and then interstate 80 west
through the rest of pennsylvania
and then wed go across ohio
all the way to toledo
and then we would go 75 north to detroit
it was gonna take about three days
with all the business breaks
and cigarette stops
since russell didnt allow
nobody to smoke in the car
he says jimmy blue eyes and meyer lansky
convinced him to stop smoking
when they were getting kicked out
of their casinos in cuba
and getting shot at by castro
i dont know
it might have been one of those
pleasegodifievergetout
ofthisfuckingthingalive
illneversmokeagain things too
but i do know that from castro on
russ wouldnt allow
nobody to smoke in his car
not even carrie
can we stop soon
were only in the car two minutes honey
were not even near the highway
i know russell
but you dont like to stop on the highway
well its not that so much
they dont let you stop on the highway
okay so then well smoke in the car
and what about my cataracts
ill crack the window
carrie i made a vow
remember
remember i made a vow carrie
yeah
now i cant smoke on
all right and now i cant smoke
see where we are
is is that
what are those odds
whats the problem kid
i dont i dont know it sounds funny
it stops it starts it loses power

uh under the contract
thanks to jimmy hoffa
management can only fire a driver
on very specific charges
so you ever show up late
no
do you have any moving violations
no
do you drink on the job
no
you ever hit anybody
on the job
yeah
no
okay
what about stealing that aint grounds
well
can they prove it
i dont think so
all right then we dont have
nothing to worry about
if they can prove it
theyre just gonna want names from you
accomplices
thats all you give them
a couple of names you go home
keep your job
what do you think about that
would you give them names
no no names
you know i dont uh
i dont care whether you did it or not
that makes no difference to me
yeah i know
im here to defend you right
right
what you want to know if i did it or not
well
im gonna defend you either way
yeah all right but
i i work hard for them
when i aint stealing from em
your honor
if this was about right or wrong
the company would have
sought mr sheerans dismissal
they didnt
they only accused mr sheeran
because the company hoped
he could name conspirators
which he couldnt do
because they dont exist
they dont exist
because he didnt steal anything
he didnt steal anything
because hes an exemplary employee
who in eight years
has never taken a day of sick leave
the only rule he ever broke
is his own unions
by helping others
carry sides of beef from his truck
to their refrigerators
in the dead of winter
all rise
court is in session
im dismissing this case
with a warning
yes your honor
no no not you mr sheeran
you bring another working man
before this court
with threats instead of evidence
believe me youll be sorry
if i owned stock in this company
i would sell it
i dont know how he did it
and i aint gonna ask
all i know is that bill bufalino
got me out of a case
where i should never
have gotten away with it
i shouldve been down for the count
people are gonna appreciate
what you did today frank

to know he was eatin with angelo bruno
i mean bruno he he was just made
the new boss of philadelphia
he took care of everything
from philadelphia to atlantic city
that i knew
and that was all i had to know
to know that russell bufalino
was no truck mechanic from canada dry
this bread is very good
good eh
where did an irisher like you
learn to speak italian
in italy  the war
ah where
salerno
anzio
sicily
around catania

the guy with the gun
would change his mind
russell

but then angelo himself
he started giving me
little things to do too

what they do is
they collect the linen towels

normally its like a license
to print fucking money
until recently
theres this other company
that opened up down in delaware
theyre trying to put us out of business
theyre cutting their prices
theyre scaring our drivers
theyre trying to take
our customers from us
to tell you the truth
im a little concerned
whenever anybody says
theyre a little concerned
theyre very concerned
as a matter of fact
im really more than a little concerned
and when they say
theyre more than a little concerned
theyre desperate
i want this fucking place bombed
burnt torched

let them collect their insurance
which im sure they have plenty
and leave this fucking other place alone

the same nonunion cab drivers
as we want to do
nobody knows who you are
and nobody knows
what the fuck youre doing here okay

you and i know why youre here
we gotta be able to sign these drivers up

about jimmy
dont ever make him wait

i cant stress this enough
his problem is that time is of essence
and thats the important thing
i gotta tell you one more thing
jimmy doesnt drink

trucking union in the world
he dont drink
the worst part about it is
he doesnt allow anybody
to drink around him
another thing about him
jimmy hates fucking watermelon
but were gonna like watermelon
jimmy you shoulda seen it
sinking in the water
one by one
i bet you when they woke up
the next morning
those fucking cab drivers
they went to look for their cabs
they didnt know what the fuck hit em
thats a great idea joey
great idea
well it wasnt my idea
my man frank it was his idea
let me tell you something
frank hit that pier
he took over the pier
whatever he told them to do
whatever he said
they did it you know
i never seen a guy walk
through a crowd like he does
he doesnt touch a fucking person
everybody gets out of the way
im not kidding you i swear
guys he never met in his life
you know it was like
like moses remember moses
when he walked into the ocean
the sea
whatever the fuck it was
and it opened up
thats him im telling you
jimmy hes got it
so uh what do you think
you need him
a couple of days more
yeah we gotta clear up
a few dribs and drabs
you guys sure like watermelon
want a bite
not on your life
you were there you saw it firsthand
those guys aint union
theyre like nazi collaborators
operating behind the lines
you know you were in the war
i sure do
in a war
you go from point a to point b
sometimes
you spill a little beer along the way
that philosophy make sense to you
sure does
good
jimmy he didnt make me
stay in his suite
because he liked me
he made me stay with him
because he didnt want me
registering in my name at the hotel
this way there was no proof
i was even in chicago
come on jimmy youre way behind
nothing stops her
after chicago
jimmy and i got close
the wives hit it off
and with jimmy and josephines kids
mostly grown up and out of the house
they got a kick out of our kids too
jimmy peggy lets get a picture
oh yes come on
especially peggy
she and jimmy
they fell for each other right away
you know what i like even better
than getting my picture took
what
surprise
peggy
to peggy jimmy wasnt like russ
or skinny or even me
sorry everybody
this is just for peggy and i
for one thing
jimmy didnt have a nickname
like the razor or the hunchback
or the weasel or whispers
so what happened to thank you
thank you
oh
and also to her
he was helping people
he was helping them
make more money live better lives
he wasnt stomping on somebodys hand
if you have it
a truck brought it to you
this is what mr hoffa says
hes the president of the teamsters union
with over a million members
they all support him
because they have steady jobs
great pay and a pension
for when they retire
the teamster pension fund
had eight billion dollars in it
and jimmy had complete control
over every bit of it
isnt this
a beautiful presentation
i mean a bridge loan is really
all im asking jimmy
im not gonna piss away
my members pension dough
on something too risky
this is not a risk jimmy
i got minskys follies
i got the first topless act on the strip
im telling you were booming in there
i cant get the drinks out
just asking for a golf course
you know you never lost a dime with me
jimmy wed really just appreciate
whatever you could do
to help jake along here
onefive is all i need
for a completion bond
okay okay go to the bank
thank you
its gonna be a big success
thank you jimmy youre a prince
youre a mensch
yeah im a mensch
and because of mr hoffa
workers have medical insurance
for when they get sick
and know when they retire
theyre not going to go hungry
there was
so much paperwork back then
that jimmy had to use
an insurance company
that was run by this kid allen dorfman
to work out the loans
no no nothing for nothing
next time
try asking a little bit fucking nicer
and and howd it go
it was a little touch and go
for a little bit
but at the end fine
good
it was russ who got jimmy
to give guys like gottlieb the loans
and you know
he would get like 10 of that
or whatever you know maybe more
listen you tell marteduzzo
from me that i appreciate it
and everybodys gonna appreciate it
its a good thing
okay ill do that
back then
you couldnt go to regular banks
because the money was for gambling
gods truth thats what it was
im serious you couldnt
so the mob what did they do
they went to the teamsters
for the money
it was the teamsters that stepped in
and lent the money that built las vegas
this is the mahogany
dont billy
dont touch the stuff
i wont
just go where you gotta go
okay
there was more business
than anybody could handle
so jimmy had to shove
some of the deals
off on to his wife jo
who had no idea she had 22
of a florida land deal
called sun valley
some charter fishing boats
and a ski lodge with its own mountain
one of jimmys clients
was sam momo giancana
who was friends with the kennedys
from back when jacks father
made his fortune with the italians
as a bootlegger during prohibition
momo sinatra hung out together
with the kennedys
momo and kennedy
believe it or not
even had the same girlfriend
together at the same time
talk about crazy
so it was easy for the mob
to help joe kennedy
get his son elected president
that was easy
they just punched up the vote a little
to make sure that he won in illinois
in exchange for that
the new president was supposedly
gonna get castro out of cuba
so our guys could get their casinos back
and race tracks and shrimp boats
and everything else that they had
and owned down there from havana back
but that that didnt happen
the italians wanted kennedy
the irishman for president
and thats what they got
get used to it
because were gonna be seeing it 247
son of a bitch
goddamn kennedys
im looking at the goddamn kennedys
jimmy the kids language
oh what difference does it make
i mean they gotta learn sooner or later
were going to war with these people
war
if i said it once
i said it a thousand times
i dont care theyre irish
i dont care theyre catholic
if theres one person
you cant trust in this life
its millionaires kids
youre right jimmy
especially that little son of a bitch
are you saying you dont remember
doing any favors for johnny dio
or you dont remember
the conversation
im saying
to the best of my recollection
i must recall on my memory
i cannot remember
then where did this 20000 come from
individuals
which individuals mr hoffa
uh
off hand that particular amount of money
i borrowed
i dont know at this particular moment
but the record of my loans
which i requested i have
and out of all the moneys i loaned
during this period of time
i went into these ventures
those goddamn kennedys
they get what they want
jimmy jimmy the kids
him and all the bullshit problems
he put me through already
jimmy
i gotta go
you dont expect me to look at this
no i dont
whoa
for guys like russ
it couldnt have been better
i mean russ
oh yeah he did his part
for getting kennedy elected
thats for sure
what are you doing
i told you to put it
i told you to put them on every pole
youre still walking around
so whats the first thing
that jack kennedy does
to thank chicago for all their help
he puts his shitass brother in there
that little prep school punk
and he winds up making him
attorney general
oh
and whats the first thing bobby does
he goes after not just jimmy
which in a way you could understand
i mean jimmy hated the kennedys so much
he gave nixon 500000 in teamster cash
but bobby also goes after giancana
marcello trafficante
and all the other guys
who put his brother in the white house
in the first place
whats that about
frank
oh thank you
merry christmas
am i missing something
thank you carrie

from uncle russell

a little something extra in there too
what do you say
to uncle russell
what do you say
huh
frank its all right
she said thank you once
thats enough
with bobby as attorney general
i mean they were all over us
i mean we couldnt talk on the phone
because we knew it was being bugged
you couldnt do nothing
you couldnt go nowhere
you couldnt do anything
it was a bad bad bad situation
and then jimmy forget it
bobby now as attorney general
he has the power
to send anybody to jail
and no question about it
and jimmy was at the top
of bobbys hit list
he even set up
a special get hoffa squad
where he had his own guys from the fbi
the irs working round the clock
their only job
was to put jimmy hoffa in jail
im serious thats all they did
i am sitting in a room
full of fuckin idiots

unfolded in the bay of pigs
nothing went as planned
paratroopers were unable
to blow up roadways
leading to the beach area
castro raced toward the scene
the underground might have blown up
the roads but it knew nothing
soon castro had artillery
firing on the beachhead
his planes destroyed invading ships
carrying a brigade of men
and vital ammunition
the beachhead could not be enlarged
and paratroopers were soon
trying to fight their way back
to the small section of the shore
where the invaders were pinned down
1500 men had been dumped
on a shore without air cover
or protective fire from ships
castro had to wait
only until they ran out of ammunition
before mopping them up
later castro was to strut around
the invasion area with newsmen
and expound on the errors
that had been made
he had ample material
the united states already humiliated
stood condemned
by most of the countries of the world
ah shit
just as i predicted they fuck up cuba
boobie starts coming after me
and the union
hes looking for some cheap publicity
thats all it is
thats what hes doing
okay
well its all gonna blow over jimmy

my client had been advised by counsel
that it was perfectly legal for his wife
to be part owner of a trucking business

challenged its legality
she withdrew from the company
immediately
that should be the end of the matter
there had been not one indictment served
against my client
in 13 grand jury investigations
your honor this is an example of
a personal vendetta against my client
against his family
by a frustrated justice department
and the attorney general robert kennedy

in the papers all the time
drawing attention to himself
and everybody what is that
who does he think he is erroll flynn
he went against
everything and everybody
just didnt give a shit
and growing up
he kidnapped his own bosses
i dont know how he got away with that
you dont get away with that
you do that you die
that simple
when he went away to the can
he recruited black guys
instead of his own kind
and when he got out
nobody knew what he was doing
or who he was doing with it
we didnt know what the hell
was going on nobody did
and if you dont like what hes doing
and you say something
then you see what happens
who does something like that
who does things like that
ill tell you ill tell you
sta test e cazzu
this disgraziato
him and oswald two of a kind
at least in dallas
the kids werent there
it was just jackie
joey your doctor called
you died an hour ago
you a jewish fellow
would you like to be
dont worry about the operation
we dont do that no more
we freeze it
and you stand there
and dont do anything
and a mexican broad
comes over with a wet rock
thwack
see its okay to laugh
i make fun of everybody
thats why god put us on this earth
to laugh
i work everyone
i make fun of blacks i make fun of jews
i work gypsies i work italians
well not those italians
no no no no
its okay joey
i got the money dont shoot
i was told today
be very careful about what you say
but uh all kidding aside
happy birthday joey
hey russ
hey what are you doing with that
you really believe
in that bullshit league
well its not that
its italian
joey joey
what did i say
oh no no
what did i say
joey joey joey joey
now listen
you cant say that stuff like that here
okay you cant do that
why not rickles is the only one
who can make jokes
the mans a boss
so im a boss hes a boss
were all supposed to be brothers right
i know youre a boss
i know but we dont wanna
have a beef now okay
were brothers right
thats right brothers
were brothers
youre brothers
were brothers
im not arguing with you
everybodys a brother
thats right youre a brother
youre his brother
im not but you guys are
so thats why
i would like it if you just
all right
okay
were brothers
youre brothers
oh yeah its my birthday
happy birthday
happy birthday
get the fuck out of here
now for something like this
youre gonna need two guns
the one youre gonna use
and a backup
you want something with more
stopping power than a 22
you definitely dont want a silencer
you want to make a lot of noise
to make the witnesses run away
so they aint gonna be looking at you
but not the noise a 45 makes
cause that makes too much noise
and a patrol car can hear it
a few blocks away at least
the cops call a 32 a womans gun
because its easier to handle
and dont do the damage a 38 does
but you know it does enough
it would be late
so the tourists from idaho
wouldnt be there
theyd be in bed
and him being down there in little italy
maybe hed be more comfortable
more relaxed
it was his birthday
so hed be there with his wife
and his kid which in this case
thats good
because thats the point
they should have to see what its like
hed already been drinking
which would have slowed him down a lot
his bodyguard would be with him
and joey himself could be carrying too
but then the piece would be
in his wifes purse probably
you never got
a lot of advance notice
all you knew was your part of it
john the redhead knew only one thing
he was gonna drop me off
circle the block and pick me up
you wanna take out the bodyguard first
not kill him
dont kill him just disable him
you got no argument with him
so not in the face or the chest
sometimes with something like this
you might want to go
to the bathroom first
it gives you a chance to make sure
nobody followed you in
it also gives you a chance to make sure
nobody is in the bathroom
you have to worry about
it also gives you a chance
to go to the bathroom
you dont want to be uncomfortable
but i went before
and in a place this small this late
you might as well just get to work
we need more wine all right
hey tommy some more wine
so how about after
cake cake cake
not yet
youre not even done eating the meal yet
you want the cake
come on you cant do that
shit
fuck fuck
it happened
in new yorks little italy
an area rumored to be neutral territory
among mobsters
after the killing
police found several guns
and some fingerprints
which they were tracing today
joseph crazy joe gallo
had come
to the intimate seafood restaurant
to cap an evening of celebration
with his new bride of less than a month
and his 11yearold daughter
by a previous marriage
they were uh celebrating
joes 47th birthday
they had been to a nightclub
early in the evening
they were sitting at a rear table

im not gonna tell this guy
what he can or cant fucking say
like hes a child
well listen
jimmy dont mean nothing
he just gets upset
russ come on
we all know hes a fucking hothead
were all hotheads once in a while
yeah but jimmy says things
he shouldnt say sometimes
yeah we all do that too
well somebody should just calm him down
yeah well that im gonna
im gonna calm him down
hes difficult but
maybe this could help him calm down
you could tell him
that i always liked him
huh
and i wont stand in his way
of him trying to get his job back
i will i will tell him that tony
okay
yes
thats not making me calm down
standing by me
what the fuck does that mean
standing by me aint the same thing
as doing something
about some outofcontrol
fucking psycho
jimmy the little guy aint a nobody
you gotta understand that
he aint a nobody
hes a cocksucker
fitz is a cocksucker
im gonna deal
with both these cocksuckers
myself
this used to be my office
go look for frank fitzsimmons there
youre not gonna find him
thats because he travels
all over the country
looking for goddamn golf courses
because thats what he does
he plays golf
who is he to run around with nixon
run around with the attorney general
he does this and collects fulltime salary
while hes doing it
now how do you do that
theres not enough hours
in a day to do this job
i was sent to prison for fraud
this is fraud what hes doing
so whats fitzs answer to jimmy
he does it by sending a message
to jimmys old friend dave johnson
now dave johnson he ran local 299
this was the message
so this is how
fitz says he wants my old pal dave johnson
to step down so he can have his son
take over local 299
this is how im gonna say no to his son
little fucking fitz
she looked a lot like your mother
about the same size
pops come on you told me
goodlooking girl
she was a goodlooking girl
but i had no idea
that it wasnt your mother
it was dark and
this is how
fitz says he doesnt like
who i say runs the 299
by firing my wife from her
fortyeightfuckingthousand
dollarayear union job
son of a bitch fuck him
he had
previously taped the locks
on the entry door
of the basement of the watergate
what are you looking at
uh its
its big ears
he had noticed
that the tape had been removed
and he retaped the door
big ears
thats uh
somebody i met a long time ago just
his ears aint so big
at that point
i said let us junk it
meaning let us scrap the operation
mr liddy and mr mccord
talked between themselves
and the decision was made to go
i thought it was very foolhardy
so frank fitzsimmons
in your opinion
should he remain
president of the teamsters
absolutely not
frank fitzsimmons
has sold his union out
to his underworld pals
the mob controls him
which means it controls our pension fund
im talking about a billion dollars
in low or nointerest loans
this man has given to known racketeers
for their illegal enterprises
not anymore
its time for the rats to abandon ship
is he serious
not jimmy this is all publicity
hes running for office
hes putting on a show
yeah its all puff
its got no substance nothing
maybe he means what he says
tony hes campaigning
russ
hes liable to say any fucking thing
i dont care
if hes campaigning
he cant talk like that
its no fucking good
i understand what youre saying
you know what he should do russ
he should cash in that big pension of his
spend more time with his grandchildren
he got a beautiful family no
yeah yeah yeah right
maybe he should relax
word should get back to him
i i just wanna say
i dont want you
to take this the wrong way
but there i was with some people
and they were saying
and you know who they are
they were saying
please tell jimmy we love the guy
we dont want any problem
we just think that he should
maybe enjoy his grandchildren
enjoy his pension enjoy his life as is
go no further frank
who said it
it dont matter who said it
oh it matters
was it russell no
no
of course its not russell
its that little cocksucker
from the miami fiasco

james hoffa
former president of the teamsters union
disappeared on wednesday
and as of tonight
no trace of him has been found
hoffa spent four years
in prison and made no bones
about his intention
frank
to get the presidency back
from his successor frank fitzsimmons
fitzsimmons son
is the vice president of
still nothing
uhuh
young fitzsimmons car
was bombed he was not in it
but there is bad blood
in the detroit local
hoffa disappeared
wednesday afternoon
now more than 48 hours later
with no word yet
on what happened to hoffa
police are extremely concerned
authorities are most anxious
to find whom hoffa
was supposed to meet
outside the red fox restaurant
where he was last seen
police think it could have been
a man named anthony giacalone
described as a big man
in the detroit mafia
hoffas son james
tried to contact giacalone today
but didnt succeed
hoffas family and friends stayed
in the family home in lake orion today
i should call jo
you havent called jo yet
why
what
why
why what
why havent you called jo
has anybody come forward
with a ransom demand
or anything like that
uh not as of yet
do you think
the abduction was for ransom
im gonna call her now
do you think the abduction
had anything to do
with the recent conflicts
within local 299 his own local
i think the union politics
is certainly something
that has to be investigated
one high official
of the teamsters international
says he fears the worst
that hoffa may have been killed
robert hager nbc news
bloomfield michigan
at a truck stop
outside detroit
where hoffa rose to the top
in the teamsters union
truck drivers had a variety of theories
she stopped talking to me
that day
august 3rd 1975
shes got a good job now
and lives just outside philly
but my daughter
peggy
disappeared
from my life that day
hello
hello
hello
jo jo
its its
frank frank
yeah yeah
yeah um
i dont
look i
frank
do you think
do you think hes alive
hes gotta be
you know you gotta think positively
its just you know it aint that long
its just
but do you
do you know hes okay
no no no i mean you know me i
he maybe did something
like the joe bananas thing
where you know
he had himself kidnapped
and then came back
but he wasnt hurt nothing happened
maybe he
maybe he just felt you know
he wanted to clear his head a bit
but you gotta just think
that its gonna be
its gonna be okay
its gonna be okay

if you need anything im here for you
anything anything

okay jo okay okay
okay
okay
talk to ya a little later bye
bye
goodbye frank
it was no more complicated than that
mr sheeran
do you know who if anyone
was behind the disappearance
of james hoffa
everybody who ever had
anything to do with jimmy
was hauled in and questioned
on the advice of counsel
i respectfully decline
to answer that question
on the grounds
that it might tend to incriminate me
okay let me ask you this
what color is my pen
and everybody took the fifth
i mean in that situation
thats what you do
what else are you gonna do
still everybody got indicted or convicted
on one thing or another
but not that
not about jimmy
nobody as you know
even went to jail for that
and nobody talked which is unusual
cause usually
three people can keep a secret
only when two of them are dead
bruno denzetta and marco rossi
they got 20 years each
for shaking down a trucking company
pro was convicted with them
but he was already back in school
for that other matter
i talked about before
well you remember
that poor union treasurer
tony three fingers
who got more votes than pro
they got him on that
sally bugs you know he did that one
one day bugs was seen
walking into the federal building
what he did itself
aint no crime
i mean a lot of people
get called in for things
but sally knows better
how come he didnt say anything
to anybody
he didnt tell anybody one word
not one word
and one thing for sure
he didnt go there for fucking lunch
sally
whats good
hey irish
turns out sally did tell somebody
he had to go in there for something
they just forgot to tell somebody else
so it was a bad hit
jimmys son chuckie
you know his foster son
was in the thing too
but he didnt know it
all chuckie knew
was he was pickin up
one of pros guys and me
and we was all gonna pick up his dad
at the red fox for a meeting
well i mean he was in it yeah
you could say that but stupidly
i i always felt sorry
for chuckie in this whole thing
and i i still do
and the feds gave him ten months
for some bullshit thing about a car
and thats about it
who knows what the fuck
fat tony salerno
they got on an income tax thing
a little while after
he was diagnosed with prostate cancer
theres a a pork store up in uh
northern california
uh right around
walnut creek
youre from up there aint you
yeah
yeah
and you might even know
the guy that runs it
actually
im looking for a little favor
for him not for me
but if you can get him a ticket
like to australia
you know what i mean
yeah
you want to help him get down there
ye yeah
now russell he got pinched
for telling jimmy the weasel
to strangle jack napoli
over some beef
about 25 grand of jewelry
that jack took on credit
from russell and then he never paid for
now with russ you dont do that
so only thing is the weasel he flipped
he had a wire on him
they called it
conspiracy to kill a witness
it was obvious to everybody else
that napoli was clearly in the wrong
i mean how could you not see that
he set him up it was entrapment
what else could you call it
but thats another thing
i dont wanna get into now
raise your right hand
they brought me up on bribery
and labor racketeering charges
and some other bullshit things
i dont know
the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
so help you god
i do
did you also tell them that mr boffa
had given you and your wife
luxury vehicles
mr cole i worked for 44 years
i never took one dime illegal
off boffa or nobody else
you can think whatever you wanna think
dont matter to me
but all they got me for was
blowing up a crane company
that fired two of my shop stewards
for no good reason
and and my lincoln
i mean
i bought that car from eugene boffa
he leased truck drivers
to freight companies
and then he paid them substandard wages
they said i paid a lot less for the car
than what it was worth
they said the car was a bribe
i i i loved that car
but it wasnt worth the 18 years
they gave me for it
thats for sure
russell he had a stroke
fat tony he couldnt control
his urine no more
and my arthritis
that started in the foxholes of anzio
was eatin away at my lower back now
and i couldnt feel much
in my feet no more
i needed a cane
but you know theyre not gonna
give you a cane in the can
because they say
youre gonna use it as a weapon
there was this medicine neurontin
it helped me a little bit
but it also made you loopy
hes got it
hes got it
ah
we were all falling apart
right there
in the freezing fucking cold
i can see it from here
you getting scared now
yeah you stay here
another fucking ten years
youll beat me
is this the good grape juice
i cant eat it
take a bite
i got no teeth i cant
put a little piece
just a little piece thank you
thats it
e buono no
buono
buono
jimmy was a good man
you know
he had a nice family too huh
yeah
yeah
i know
i never wanted it to go that far
i picked us over him
fuck em
fuck em
fuck em
mangia che cresci figlio mio mangia
hey russ
hey frankie
where you goin
what
where you goin
im going to church
church
dont laugh youll see
dont laugh
youll see
russell went to church
then he went to the prison hospital
and uh
and then he went to the graveyard
lord jesus christ by your own
i got out that october
reenie died in december
on december 23rd to be exact
lung cancer
no surprise
even as it claims
our mortal bodies
grant that our sister
may sleep here in peace
until you awaken her to glory
for you are the resurrection
and the life
and then she will see you face to face
and in your light will see light
and know the splendor of god
for ever and ever amen
six points shy
of his career average of 296
coming into this season
top four batters in this lineup for
philadelphia today are all switch hitters
much to the frustration
of some policy makers
nato military leaders will not risk
low flying attacks
on serb troops in kosovo
it could take days more
of systematic bombing especially since
the serbs have hidden so many
of their antiaircraft missiles
in essence daring nato to fly low
you go you go there yeah yeah
yeah yeah
peggy
peggy i just want to talk
i just you know i
she walked away
i know shes mad at me and all
but i i want
call her call her
i just want to talk to her
talk to her and tell her what
what
i just want to say im sorry thats all
for
look
i know i wasnt a a good dad
i know that
i know that
i was just trying to protect her
protect all of youse
i mean thats what i was doing
thats
from what
well everything
i mean
you youse had
a sheltered life in a way
because you didnt see what i see
and what ive been through
theres a lot of bad people out there
what else am i gonna do
daddy you have no idea
what it was like for us
i mean we couldnt go to you
with a problem
cause of what you would do
you know
we couldnt come to you for protection
because of the terrible things
that you would do
i was just i was
i didnt want to see
youse get hurt thats all
um
i know you read a lot of things about me
heard about me
im sorry
i um
can i do anything now
to make it up to you
huh
if youre looking for something
with a little bit more luxury
we have these two models
over here
theyre like the cadillacs of caskets
now if we puttin you
in the fuckin oven
it really doesnt matter what you go in
the cheapest shit possible
particle board thats it
what are we doin today
are we doin a cremation
a burial
burial
uh is it for a man or for a woman
me
shit
you see anything you like
uh
that green one
thats a beauty
that onell set you back about 7500
if you take it home today
what do you think
can you do any better
i mean buddy
this is what you want to go home in no
i think we could go six
on that for you how about that
six flat cash work for you
thats good
good for me
sooner or later
everybody put here has a date
when hes gonna go
thats just the way it is
and i think theres gotta be
something when you go
cause i mean how the hell
did this whole thing start
people smarter than me
cant figure it out
thats why i would never go for cremation
because its so
its so final
this this one
thats the hardest part
of anybody when they bury youse
is when they go into the ground
because its
its so final
if you go into a building
the buildings there
the crypt is there
it has to be a metal casket
and they have you in the room
and all that there
its just not as final youre dead
but it aint that final

in the still of the night
i held you
held you tight
cause i love
love you so
promise ill never
let you go
in the still of the night
in the still of the night
i remember
that night in may
the stars were bright above
ill hope and ill pray
to keep
your precious love
well before the light
hold me again
with all of your might
in the still of the night
in the still of the night
so before the light
