seen pictures of
i know you
but weve never met
im with you
but i dont know your name
i know im dreaming but it
feels like more than that
it feels like a memory
how can that be
march 14th 2077
five years since
the mandatory memory wipe
and im still haunted
by these dreams
victoria and i were
assigned together
in two weeks our mission here will be
finished and well i join the others
but the questions i ask
she doesnt
the things i wonder about
she wont
its been half a century since the
scavengers destroyed our moon
forced to leave their own dying
planet they came to take ours
without the moon the earth
was thrown into chaos
earthquakes toppled
cities within hours
tsunamis wiped
out what remained
then came the invasion
we did what we had to do
we used the nukes
we won the war
but lost the planet
left it contaminated
most of it uninhabitable
what remained of humanity
had to leave the earth
we built the tet
our mission control
a temporary space station
before the migration to titan
saturns largest moon
everyones there now
well almost everyone
until our tour is complete
vika and i do our job
we protect the hydro rigs
which convert earths sea water
into fusion energy
for the new colony
the survival of humanity
depends on it
thank you for the coffee
remnants of the scavenger army
continue to disrupt the operation
they attack our drones
at night
and try to kill me
during the day
theres still fight in them
but i dont know why
mission says we have done well
that we are an effective team
vikas my
communications officer
she keeps an eye on me
i handle drone maintenance
the drones watch everything
vika cant wait to go
me im not so sure
i cant shake
the feeling that earth
in spite of all
thats happened
earth is still my home

jack
copy tower
what happened
i lost you for a second
really
coming up on location
there it is
ive got multiple scav kills
drone 166 put up
a hell of a fight
got any movement
no sign of scavenger activity
but ive got limited visibility here
jack due to low angle of mission
copy that im coming in hot
starting repairs
watch my back
i always do
you know
i read about this game
it was played right here
the last super bowl
please dont tell me
it was a classic
a classic game
down by four
the ball
was on the 50yard line
seconds left on the clock
the ball is snapped
and the qb fumbles
disaster
looks like the game is over
im reading the whole
central core offalignment
you dont have the necessary
tools down there
and a new fuel cell is
not going to fix that
but this qb runs back
and picks up his own fumble
hold on what did you just do
theres a wall of linebackers
closing in on him
so he throws a long ball with
no idea who is at the other end
a hail mary
eightythousand people
on their feet
watching this ball
sail through the air
downfield is a rookie wide
receiver third string
he just leaps out of the pack
touchdown
contact west contact
jack
its okay vika
its just a dog
hey
now go on you gotta
get out of here
go on get
get out of here go
tech49 jack harper
youre welcome
166 is back online
two drones shot down today ten fuel
cells stolen in just over a month
these scavs are getting bolder
well the hydro rigs
are taking all the water
once were gone theyll have
nothing but dust and radiation
this is bullshit
we won the war
now we have to leave
two more weeks jack
then well be on
our way to titan
yep
that drone is out
there somewhere
we just have to find it
without a beacon thats like
finding a needle in a haystack
so we go to our ground game
tower ive located 172
down a sinkhole
no visual but i can hear it
tets so far off angle
i can barely see you
hows it look
its good its good theres no
sign of scav activity on top
tets offline in 15 minutes
after that youre on your own
mission this is tower 49
jack has located drone 172
engaged in recovery now
requesting backup
to his location asap
ive got a visual on drone 172
jack
what the hell
shit
jack
tech49 jack harper
jack harper tech49
hey
oh no
come on not my goddamn bike
how can a man die
better than facing fearful odds
for the ashes of his fathers
and the temples of his gods
jack
yep ill be right there
how does 109 look
can it fly
barely
and without armor
shes a sitting duck
well ill talk to sally about
that shielding in the morning
okay
again
what jack harper
where did you get this
it was growing in
come on jack
you know the regulations
i know you think im a stickler
but you have no idea
what kind of toxins
could be in something
like that
its a flower vika
yeah thats not the point
its that we are
so close to the end
and the last thing that we need
is you putting it all at risk
okay
every day
you have to go down there
and see what was lost
but weve done our job jack
its time to go
i dont think they were
trying to kill me today
the scavs
they were trying to catch me
well they cant have you
come on
you should come with me
sometime before we leave
theres a place i found
id like to show you
ill show you something
hey hey
oh my god
it was a sixstage meltdown
from inside the hydro rigs core
its offline permanently
tower 49 you have put
the whole operation at risk
i need to know
exactly what happened
jack believes the scavs
weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells
and got it into the suction
tower hold
tower ive got a rogue signal in grid 37
are you seeing this
yes
its gotta be scav
its not one of ours
jack the signal is
being directed offplanet
on my way
tower our logs show you are missing
an additional nine fuel cells
can you confirm
negative mission
that number is 10
drone 172 was lost last night
109 is combatready as soon
as we get that shielding
we can cover the remaining
rigs with drones in the field
ive run the numbers
well do the numbers up here
tower
im tasking the drones
to defensive positions
copy
our job is to run those rigs your
directive is to protect them
we cannot afford to lose another
do you copy
copy
are you and jack
an effective team
damn right we are
jack
youre right on top of it
do you have a visual
jack
yeah i got it
they have some kind
of a repeater
the scavs are using
the building as an antenna
can you decrypt
its a set of coordinates
grid 17
its a goddamn homing beacon
grid 17
what the hell is out there
nothing
its the middle of nowhere
what is going on
why would the scavs send
a signal offplanet jack
im shutting it down
tech49 check your course youre
headed right for the border
that radiation will cook you from
the inside before you know it
its okay vika i see it
im gonna do a perimeter check
before i head home
i may go offcomm
jack
we should keep in contact
just let me know where you are
do you copy
jack do you copy
thats right bob
you know where were going
are you gonna miss me
im gonna miss this place
it would have been great
it would have been great
vika vika did you get that
jack where have you been
an object came down in 17
thats the beacon coordinates
exactly
i saw it some sort of vessel
jack missions almost offline
im en route now
mission we have an unidentified
object impact in 17
it came down at coordinates
sent by a scav beacon
my techs en route now
tower

but drones are already
mobile and executing
have your tech stand down
copy
jack mission wants you to stand down
the drones will handle it
thats a negative tower
with tet offline
we need our eyes on this
i want to know
this site is secure
sally my techs concerned about
the security of the site
tower you have lost
enough assets for today
keep your tech out of there
do you copy
copy command im
jack command wants you to stand down
the drones will handle this
im on site
jack
i dont have eyes on you

vika i think its one of ours
this thing is ancient
it looks
prewar
the scavs brought
this thing down jack
theres no sign of scavs
technician
this is your control
im ordering you to pull out and
return to the tower immediately
touching down
theyre human
tower we have got survivors

julia
im sorry for what
i have to tell you
but you were in a crash
your ship came down
jack managed to pull you
from the wreckage
but none of your crew survived
what do you mean
youre the only one
that made it
im sorry
youve been in delta sleep
for a long time
some disorientation is normal
how long
sixty years
at least
i have to get back to our ship
its too dangerous down there
you need to rest
vika
dont touch me
your ships reentry was triggered
by a beacon from the surface
do you know
anything about that
what was your mission
its classified
well we have
no record of an odyssey
i cant tell you anything
until i get the flight
recorder from my ship
julia a lot has
changed in 60 years
while you were in delta sleep
earth was attacked
call them scavs
they destroyed our moon and
with that half the planet
then they invaded
we won the war
but earth was ruined
everyones on titan now
its a moon of saturn
or on the space station
getting ready to go
were here for security
and drone maintenance
were the mopup crew
youve lost people
everything
if you want to be alone
we understand
the drones killed
her entire crew
if i hadnt gotten there
i want her gone first thing
vika
do you have any memories
before the mission
before the security wipe
our job is not to remember
remember
do you remember her
jack
that was a scav beacon
that brought her down
we dont know who she is
or what she is
lets just get
through the night
okay
you fly that thing
yes
what happens now
the tet will be online soon
victoria will
report your rescue
theyll send
someone down for you
from the tet
yes
i need to get the flight
recorder from my ship
the scavs they move at night
they could be
all over it by now
i need to know what happened
you need to know what happened
please
jack
jack what are you doing
vika shes a flight officer
she wants to see her ship and
secure the flight recorder
now you would
want the same thing
jack i
i cant protect you
no i understand
this ones on me
i couldnt save them
jack jack
jack can you hear me
all right its time to go
jack
i found it
jack
tower 49 how are yall
this lovely morning
another day in paradise
sally
jack took a predawn patrol
and went offcomm
near the canyons in 17
now
i know were low on drones
but requesting one
to sweep the area
just a quick scout
copy 49
tasking 185 to grid 22
and how can a man die
better than facing fearful odds
for the ashes of his fathers
and the temples of his gods
ive been watching you jack
youre curious
what are you looking
for in those books
do they bring
back old memories
you wont get anything from me
my memory has been
wiped to protect
the security of
the mission yes
you cant have
your precious memory
falling into the wrong
hands now can you
tell me
have you ever met
a scav up close
of course not
you just repair drones
dont go into
the radiation zone
dont ask too many questions
not part of
the job description
lights
were not alien jack
were human
of course for us
being human is a problem
old stealth fighter tech
shields us from your scanners
vocal scrambling
can you hear me jack
keeps your drones confused
well most of the time
the drones are programmed
to kill humans jack
you saw what they did
to those sleep pods
you almost got yourself blown
to bits protecting that woman
why did you do that
anyone would have
anyone
interesting
were wasting our time
the drone will track him here
thats sergeant sykes
he thinks im a fool for
having brought you here
i hope you prove him wrong
mission
im picking up a bio trail
somewhere near
the west canyons
can you confirm the sequence
stand by
dna confirmed its jack
vika are you okay
everything good
between you two
of course
youre still an effective team
were great
never better
we were running
a ground game and losing
so we decided
what the hell
weve got to
throw the long ball
it took us decades just
to crack the gps codes
thats how you brought
down the odyssey
why
the odysseys compact
reactor courtesy of nasa
very hard to come by
did you like
the show last night
that was just one fuel cell
imagine what 10
of them will do
with a core of
weaponsgrade plutonium
we have a nuke and we
have a drone to carry it
but we cant access it
it doesnt know who we are
but it knows you jack
we need you to
program the drone
have it carry our
nuke up to the tet
end this war
there are people up there
sergeant
program the drone
to return to the tet
it needs to go
right to the center
screw you
we havent got time for this
hey hey
no
lets go
get him up
mission
185 just went offgrid
copy tower
were seeing the same thing
permission to task
two additional drones
if one drone is here
more will come
and they wont stop
until they find me
theyll turn
this place to dust
but if you let us go
ill call them off
its your only chance
ive been to your
radiation zones
if youre looking
for the truth
thats where youll find it
youve risked all our lives
everything
what makes you
think hes different
she does
mission ive found
my tech over in 37
you can call off the search
copy that tower
glad jacks safe
tasking the other drones
back to rig support
where are we going now
who are you
what arent you telling me
jack i
what were you
doing on the odyssey
what was your mission
it was a research flight
to titan my first
thats what it was
supposed to be
six weeks to launch deep space
scanners picked up an alien object
we were reassigned
to investigate
they put us all in delta
they must have woken
you and victoria first
what
that object
was the tet jack
the tet was our mission
thats impossible
thats impossible
who are you
im your wife
i dont know what happened but
youre not who you think you are
jack we were here
you asked me to meet you brought
me up on top of the world
i could tell
you were nervous that day
it was right here jack
you said
look through here
and ill show you the future
and i held up a ring
and you said
yes
there you are
there you are

just stay away from me
vika please

drones are unreliable
sometimes things go wrong
go wrong
you killed her
i know its tragic
she was a wonderful person
jack we want to bring you in
ive been
authorized to tell you
were going to
assign you a new mission
you and the survivor
theres a lot of interest up here

okay
this is gonna hurt
hell of a day bob
you always loved this song
im not him
i know im not
but ive loved you
for as long as i can remember
i dont know
how else to say it
you know what
you said to me once
you said when it was all over you
would build me a house on a lake
we would grow old
and fat together
and we would fight
maybe drink too much
real romantic
and then we would die
and be buried in
a meadow by the lake
and the world would
forget about us
but we would
always have each other
i remember
those memories are yours jack
theyre ours
they are you
good morning
i wanted to spend
the rest of my life here
you still can
i have to go
those people need my help
well come back when its over
promise me
well come back when its over
you had me worried
for a second
i thought you
werent coming back
well i had to prove him wrong
you look like shit
you should see the other guy
if i had told you what
youd find out there
you would have
thought i was crazy
i still do
malcolm beech
julia harper
come on
mission
im picking up a biotrail
somewhere near
the west canyons
can you confirm the sequence
stand by
dna confirmed its jack
mission
185 just went offgrid
copy tower
were seeing the same thing
id been in the army less than a
year when that unholy tet arrived
i saw the moon get taken out
right up there
in the night sky
i couldnt believe it
after that nature took over
theres bedrock around chicago
so we were spared the worst
of the waves and the quakes
most people just starved
then the tet sent
troop ships down
the doors opened
and out you came
astronaut jack harper
thousands of you
memory wiped
programmed to kill
they had taken one of our best
and turned him against us
no soul
no humanity
the tet
what a brilliant machine
feeding off one planet
after another for energy
phase two was drones
repairmen
50 years of watching those hydro
rigs suck our planet dry
then one day
i saw you set down
another drone to fix
but in the rubble
that day was a book
you picked it up
you studied it
and i thought i saw a way
when you stepped in front of
that drone and saved her
i knew
you were in there somewhere
i just had to find
a way to bring you back
watch it watch it
eyes on it steady
give it some space
come on youre
making it nervous
that is one pissedoff weapon
no its just a machine
im the weapon
i would love to be there to see
that things face
when this goes off
that would be a oneway trip
yeah but it would be worth it
welcome back commander
open the doors
shit
spread out
head down keep your head down
jack
follow me
come on you son of a bitch
hey
jack
im okay
the drone
send the drone
its gone
i thought we had it
i really did
i can take the bomb myself
you know it will
swat you like a fly

no
she asked you to bring me up
so bring me up
well go together
it reminds me of home
ready

this is the only way
proceed to landing

welcome home jack
come on
jack
youre doing the right thing
i dont know what you
are or where youre from
but id like to tell you
about something i read
a story from rome
a city you destroyed
its a classic
there was a guy horatius
held the bridge alone
against a whole army
and what horatius said was
how can a man die better
you dont have to die jack
she doesnt have to die
everybody dies sally
the thing is to die well
jack thats not
the survivor you promised me
no its not
what horatius said was
how can a man die better
than facing fearful odds
drones get inside get inside
for the ashes of his fathers
and the temples of his gods
i created you jack
i am your god
fuck you sally
earth after the war
three years have passed
since i saw your face
i wonder if i come to
you at night in dreams
in the day as memories
do i haunt your hours
the way you haunted mine
and i wonder if you see me
when you look at her
mommy look
if we have souls they are
made of the love we share
undimmed by time
unbound by death
for three years i searched
for the house he built
i knew it had to be out there
