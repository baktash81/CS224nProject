seen pictures of 
i know you   
but we ve never met 
i m with you   
but i don t know your name 
i know i m dreaming  but it
feels like more than that 
it feels like a memory 
how can that be 
march 14th  2077 
five years since
the mandatory memory wipe 
and i m still haunted
by these dreams 
victoria and i were
assigned together 
in two weeks  our mission here will be
finished  and we ll i join the others 
but the questions i ask 
she doesn t 
the things i wonder about 
she won t 
it s been half a century since the
scavengers destroyed our moon 
forced to leave their own dying
planet  they came to take ours 
without the moon  the earth
was thrown into chaos 
earthquakes toppled
cities within hours 
tsunamis wiped
out what remained 
then came the invasion 
we did what we had to do 
we used the nukes 
we won the war 
but lost the planet 
left it contaminated 
most of it uninhabitable 
what remained of humanity
had to leave the earth 
we built the tet 
our mission control 
a temporary space station
before the migration to titan 
saturn s largest moon 
everyone s there now 
well  almost everyone 
until our tour is complete 
vika and i do our job 
we protect the hydro rigs 
which convert earth s sea water
into fusion energy
for the new colony 
the survival of humanity
depends on it 
thank you for the coffee 
remnants of the scavenger army
continue to disrupt the operation 
they attack our drones
at night 
and try to kill me
during the day 
there s still fight in them 
but i don t know why 
mission says we have done well 
that we are an effective team 
vika s my
communications officer 
she keeps an eye on me 
i handle drone maintenance 
the drones watch everything 
vika can t wait to go 
me  i m not so sure 
i can t shake
the feeling that earth 
in spite of all
that s happened   
earth is still my home 
jack harper  tech 49

  you have two drones offline 
perimeter s compromised 
copy that  relaying to tech 
stand by 
jack  166 is down in grid 37 
linking to beacon now 
you ll go there first 
got it  on my way 
mission  tech 49 is
en route to grid 37 now 
can you plug that hole
with drone 109 
negative  109 is in the dock 
still waiting for parts 
jack better find those drones
and get  em flying 
those rigs can t be
exposed overnight 
copy that 
tower 
didn t he fix 166 recently 
jack has fixed all
the drones recently 
and  if we had the parts
that we ve been asking for 
we wouldn t be running
a skeleton crew down here 
understood 
we re doing the best we can 
are you an effective team 
we are an effective team 
your directive today
is to rehabilitate 166
and find 172 
get  em flying by sundown 
and i ll buy you two a round of
drinks when you get up to the tet 
you had better be ready  sally 
two weeks now 
we re keeping track 
okay 
come on  bob  work
with me  here  buddy 
tech 49 
tech 49 
jack 
copy  tower 
what happened 
i lost you for a second 
really 
coming up on location 
there it is 
i ve got multiple scav kills 
drone 166 put up
a hell of a fight 
got any movement 
no sign of scavenger activity 
but i ve got limited visibility  here 
jack  due to low angle of mission 
copy that  i m coming in hot 
starting repairs 
watch my back 
i always do 
you know 
i read about this game 
it was played right here 
the last super bowl 
please don t tell me
it was a classic 
a classic game 
down by four 
the ball
was on the 50 yard line 
seconds left on the clock 
the ball is snapped 
and the qb fumbles 
disaster 
looks like the game is over 
i m reading the whole
central core off alignment 
you don t have the necessary
tools down there 
and a new fuel cell is
not going to fix that 
but this qb runs back 
and picks up his own fumble 
hold on  what did you just do 
there s a wall of linebackers
closing in on him 
so  he throws a long ball with
no idea who is at the other end 
a hail mary 
eighty thousand people
on their feet 
watching this ball
sail through the air 
downfield is a rookie wide
receiver  third string 
he just leaps out of the pack 
touchdown 
contact  west contact 
jack 
it s okay  vika 
it s just a dog 
hey 
now  go on  you gotta
get out of here 
go on  get 
get out of here  go 
tech 49  jack harper 
you re welcome 
166 is back online 
two drones shot down today  ten fuel
cells stolen in just over a month 
these scavs are getting bolder 
well  the hydro rigs
are taking all the water 
once we re gone  they ll have
nothing but dust and radiation 
this is bullshit 
we won the war 
now we have to leave 
two more weeks  jack 
then we ll be on
our way to titan 
yep 
that drone is out
there somewhere 
we just have to find it 
without a beacon  that s like
finding a needle in a haystack 
so we go to our ground game 
tower  i ve located 172
down a sinkhole 
no visual  but i can hear it 
tet s so far off angle 
i can barely see you 
how s it look 
it s good  it s good  there s no
sign of scav activity on top 
tet s offline in 15 minutes 
after that  you re on your own 
mission  this is tower 49 
jack has located drone 172 
engaged in recovery now 
requesting backup
to his location asap 
i ve got a visual on drone 172 
jack 
what the hell 
shit 
jack 
tech 49  jack harper 
jack harper  tech 49 
hey 
oh  no 
come on  not my goddamn bike 
 how can a man die
better than facing fearful odds 
 for the ashes of his fathers
and the temples of his gods 
jack 
yep  i ll be right there 
how does 109 look 
can it fly 
barely 
and without armor 
she s a sitting duck 
well  i ll talk to sally about
that shielding in the morning 
okay 
again 
what  jack harper 
where did you get this 
it was growing in   
come on  jack 
you know the regulations 
i know you think i m a stickler
but you have no idea
what kind of toxins
could be in something
like that 
it s a flower  vika 
yeah  that s not the point 
it s that we are
so close to the end 
and the last thing that we need
is you putting it all at risk 
okay 
every day 
you have to go down there
and see what was lost 
but we ve done our job  jack 
it s time to go 
i don t think they were
trying to kill me today 
the scavs 
they were trying to catch me 
well  they can t have you 
come on 
you should come with me
sometime  before we leave 
there s a place i found
i d like to show you 
i ll show you something 
hey  hey 
oh  my god 
it was a six stage meltdown
from inside the hydro rig s core 
it s offline permanently 
tower 49  you have put
the whole operation at risk 
i need to know
exactly what happened 
jack believes the scavs
weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells
and got it into the suction 
tower  hold 
tower  i ve got a rogue signal in grid 37 
are you seeing this 
yes 
it s gotta be scav 
it s not one of ours 
jack  the signal is
being directed off planet 
on my way 
tower  our logs show you are missing
an additional nine fuel cells 
can you confirm 
negative  mission 
that number is 10 
drone 172 was lost last night 
109 is combat ready as soon
as we get that shielding 
we can cover the remaining
rigs with drones in the field 
i ve run the numbers 
we ll do the numbers up here 
tower 
i m tasking the drones
to defensive positions 
copy 
our job is to run those rigs  your
directive is to protect them 
we cannot afford to lose another 
do you copy 
copy 
are you and jack
an effective team 
damn right we are 
jack 
you re right on top of it 
do you have a visual 
jack 
yeah  i got it 
they have some kind
of a repeater 
the scavs are using
the building as an antenna 
can you decrypt 
it s a set of coordinates 
grid 17 
it s a goddamn homing beacon 
grid 17 
what the hell is out there 
nothing 
it s the middle of nowhere 
what is going on 
why would the scavs send
a signal off planet  jack 
i m shutting it down 
tech 49  check your course  you re
headed right for the border 
that radiation will cook you from
the inside before you know it 
it s okay  vika  i see it 
i m gonna do a perimeter check
before i head home 
i may go off comm 
jack 
we should keep in contact 
just let me know where you are 
do you copy 
jack  do you copy 
that s right  bob 
you know where we re going 
are you gonna miss me 
i m gonna miss this place 
it would have been great 
it would have been great 
vika  vika  did you get that 
jack  where have you been 
an object came down in 17 
that s the beacon coordinates 
exactly 
i saw it  some sort of vessel 
jack  mission s almost offline 
i m en route now 
mission  we have an unidentified
object impact in 17 
it came down at coordinates
sent by a scav beacon 
my tech s en route now 
tower 
we re going offline soon 
but drones are already
mobile and executing 
have your tech stand down 
copy 
jack  mission wants you to stand down 
the drones will handle it 
that s a negative  tower 
with tet offline 
we need our eyes on this 
i want to know
this site is secure 
sally  my tech s concerned about
the security of the site 
tower  you have lost
enough assets for today 
keep your tech out of there 
do you copy 
copy  command  i m   
jack  command wants you to stand down 
the drones will handle this 
i m on site 
jack 
i don t have eyes on you 
command s offline 
vika  i think it s one of ours 
this thing is ancient 
it looks   
pre war 
the scavs brought
this thing down  jack 
there s no sign of scavs 
technician 
this is your control 
i m ordering you to pull out and
return to the tower immediately 
touching down 
they re human 
tower  we have got survivors 
there are four   
check it  five survivors 
they are human 
stand down 
vika  the drones are
firing on survivors 
jack  the tet s offline 
i don t have control 
stand down 
jack harper  tech 49 
back off  you son of a bitch 
back off 
open the door 
vika 
get the med kit 
get the med kit 
this has to be reported 
be sure and report
that the drones
killed the crew from
one of our own ships 
see what command makes of that 
it s breathing fluid 
just let her get it out 
jack 
here  you re still dehydrated 
where are we 
i m victoria  this is jack 
what s your name 
i m julia 
julia   
i m sorry for what
i have to tell you 
but you were in a crash 
your ship came down 
jack managed to pull you
from the wreckage 
but none of your crew survived 
what do you mean 
you re the only one
that made it 
i m sorry 
you ve been in delta sleep
for a long time 
some disorientation is normal 
how long 
sixty years 
at least 
i have to get back to our ship 
it s too dangerous down there 
you need to rest 
vika   
don t touch me 
your ship s re entry was triggered
by a beacon from the surface 
do you know
anything about that 
what was your mission 
it s classified 
well  we have
no record of an odyssey   
i can t tell you anything
until i get the flight
recorder from my ship 
julia  a lot has
changed in 60 years 
while you were in delta sleep 
earth was attacked 
call them scavs 
they destroyed our moon and
with that  half the planet 
then they invaded 
we won the war 
but earth was ruined 
everyone s on titan now 
it s a moon of saturn 
or on the space station 
getting ready to go 
we re here for security
and drone maintenance 
we re the mop up crew 
you ve lost people 
everything 
if you want to be alone 
we understand 
the drones killed
her entire crew 
if i hadn t gotten there   
i want her gone first thing 
vika   
do you have any memories
before the mission 
before the security wipe 
our job is not to remember 
remember 
do you remember her 
jack   
that was a scav beacon
that brought her down 
we don t know who she is 
or what she is 
let s just get
through the night 
okay 
you fly that thing 
yes 
what happens now 
the tet will be online soon 
victoria will
report your rescue 
they ll send
someone down for you 
from the tet 
yes 
i need to get the flight
recorder from my ship 
the scavs  they move at night 
they could be
all over it by now 
i need to know what happened 
you need to know what happened 
please 
jack 
jack  what are you doing 
vika  she s a flight officer 
she wants to see her ship and
secure the flight recorder 
now  you would
want the same thing 
jack  i   
i can t protect you 
no  i understand 
this one s on me 
i couldn t save them 
jack  jack 
jack  can you hear me 
all right  it s time to go 
jack 
i found it 
jack 
tower 49  how are y all
this lovely morning 
another day in paradise 
sally   
jack took a pre dawn patrol
and went off comm
near the canyons in 17 
now 
i know we re low on drones 
but  requesting one
to sweep the area 
just a quick scout 
copy 49 
tasking 185 to grid 22 
 and how can a man die
better than facing fearful odds 
 for the ashes of his fathers 
 and the temples of his gods 
i ve been watching you  jack 
you re curious 
what are you looking
for in those books 
do they bring
back old memories 
you won t get anything from me 
my memory has been
wiped to protect   
the security of
the mission  yes 
you can t have
your precious memory
falling into the wrong
hands  now  can you 
tell me 
have you ever met
a scav up close 
of course not 
you just repair drones 
 don t go into
the radiation zone  
 don t ask too many questions  
not part of
the job description 
lights 
we re not alien  jack 
we re human 
of course  for us 
being human is a problem 
old stealth fighter tech 
shields us from your scanners 
vocal scrambling 
can you hear me  jack 
keeps your drones confused 
well  most of the time 
the drones are programmed   
to kill humans  jack 
you saw what they did
to those sleep pods 
you almost got yourself blown
to bits protecting that woman 
why did you do that 
anyone would have 
 anyone  
interesting 
we re wasting our time 
the drone will track him here 
that s sergeant sykes 
he thinks i m a fool for
having brought you here 
i hope you prove him wrong 
mission 
i m picking up a bio trail
somewhere near
the west canyons 
can you confirm the sequence 
stand by 
dna confirmed  it s jack 
vika  are you okay 
everything good
between you two 
of course 
you re still an effective team 
we re great 
never better 
we were running
a ground game  and losing 
so  we decided 
 what the hell  
 we ve got to
throw the long ball  
it took us decades just
to crack the gps codes 
that s how you brought
down the odyssey 
why 
the odyssey s compact
reactor  courtesy of nasa 
very hard to come by 
did you like
the show last night 
that was just one fuel cell 
imagine what 10
of them will do 
with a core of
weapons grade plutonium 
we have a nuke  and we
have a drone to carry it 
but we can t access it 
it doesn t know who we are 
but it knows you  jack 
we need you to
program the drone 
have it carry our
nuke up to the tet 
end this war 
there are people up there 
sergeant 
program the drone
to return to the tet 
it needs to go
right to the center 
screw you 
we haven t got time for this 
hey  hey 
no 
  let s go 
  get him up 
mission 
185 just went off grid 
copy  tower 
we re seeing the same thing 
permission to task
two additional drones 
if one drone is here 
more will come 
and they won t stop
until they find me 
they ll turn
this place to dust 
but if you let us go 
i ll call them off 
it s your only chance 
i ve been to your
 radiation zones  
if you re looking
for the truth 
that s where you ll find it 
you ve risked all our lives 
everything 
what makes you
think he s different 
she does 
mission  i ve found
my tech over in 37 
you can call off the search 
copy that  tower 
glad jack s safe 
tasking the other drones
back to rig support 
where are we going now 
who are you 
what aren t you telling me 
jack  i   
what were you
doing on the odyssey 
what was your mission 
it was a research flight
to titan  my first 
that s what it was
supposed to be 
six weeks to launch  deep space
scanners picked up an alien object 
we were reassigned
to investigate 
they put us all in delta 
they must have woken
you and victoria first 
what 
that object
was the tet  jack 
the tet was our mission 
that s impossible 
that s impossible 
who are you 
i m your wife 
i don t know what happened  but
you re not who you think you are 
jack  we were here 
you asked me to meet you  brought
me up on top of the world 
i could tell
you were nervous that day 
it was right here  jack 
you said 
 look through here 
and i ll show you the future  
and i held up a ring 
and you said

you ve gotta listen to me 
she s impeding his abilities 
and he is unfit for service 
no  no  no 
i m sorry to hear that  vika

an effective team 
vika

there is no titan 
they lied to us

vika  please 
there are things   
things you need to know 
i don t want to know 
jack   
hi  jack  i don t believe
we ve had the pleasure 
what have you done 
you can t blame yourself for this 
drones are unreliable 
sometimes things go wrong 
 go wrong  
you killed her 
i know  it s tragic 
she was a wonderful person 
jack  we want to bring you in 
i ve been
authorized to tell you
we re going to
assign you a new mission 
you and the survivor 
there s a lot of interest up here

i should get back out there 
you come all the way home

i was thinking

to the surface 
we could go right now

you won t believe
what s down there 
jack

i m done talking about it 
okay 
this is gonna hurt 
hell of a day  bob 
you always loved this song 
i m not him 
i know i m not 
but i ve loved you   
for as long as i can remember 
i don t know
how else to say it 
you know what
you said to me once 
you said when it was all over  you
would build me a house on a lake 
we would grow old
and fat together 
and we would fight 
maybe drink too much 
real romantic 
and then we would die
and be buried in
a meadow by the lake 
and the world would
forget about us 
but we would
always have each other 
i remember 
those memories are yours  jack 
they re ours 
they are you 
good morning 
i wanted to spend
the rest of my life here 
you still can 
i have to go 
those people need my help 
we ll come back when it s over 
promise me 
we ll come back when it s over 
you had me worried
for a second 
i thought you
weren t coming back 
well  i had to prove him wrong 
you look like shit 
you should see the other guy 
if i had told you what
you d find out there 
you would have
thought i was crazy 
i still do 
malcolm beech 
julia harper 
come on 
mission 
i m picking up a bio trail
somewhere near
the west canyons 
can you confirm the sequence 
stand by 
dna confirmed  it s jack 
mission 
185 just went off grid 
copy  tower 
we re seeing the same thing 
i d been in the army less than a
year when that unholy tet arrived 
i saw the moon get taken out 
right up there
in the night sky 
i couldn t believe it 
after that  nature took over 
there s bedrock around chicago 
so we were spared the worst
of the waves and the quakes 
most people just starved 
then the tet sent
troop ships down 
the doors opened 
and out you came 
astronaut jack harper 
thousands of you 
memory wiped 
programmed to kill 
they had taken one of our best
and turned him against us 
no soul 
no humanity 
the tet 
what a brilliant machine 
feeding off one planet
after another for energy 
phase two was drones 
repairmen 
50 years of watching those hydro
rigs suck our planet dry 
then one day 
i saw you set down 
another drone to fix 
but in the rubble
that day was a book 
you picked it up 
you studied it 
and i thought i saw a way 
when you stepped in front of
that drone and saved her 
i knew 
you were in there somewhere 
i just had to find
a way to bring you back 
watch it  watch it 
eyes on it  steady 
give it some space 
come on  you re
making it nervous 
that is one pissed off weapon 
no  it s just a machine 
i m the weapon 
i would love to be there to see
that thing s face
when this goes off 
that would be a one way trip 
yeah  but it would be worth it 
welcome back  commander 
open the doors 
shit 
spread out 
head down  keep your head down 
jack 
follow me 
come on  you son of a bitch 
hey 
jack 
i m okay 
the drone 
send the drone 
it s gone 
i thought we had it 
i really did 
i can take the bomb myself 
you know it will
swat you like a fly 
not if i go 
no 
she asked you to bring me up 
so bring me up 
we ll go together 
it reminds me of home 
ready

you re doing the right thing 
i don t know what you

but i d like to tell you
about something i read 
a story from rome 
a city you destroyed 
it s a classic 
there was a guy  horatius 
held the bridge alone
against a whole army 
and what horatius said was 
 how can a man die better    
you don t have to die  jack 
she doesn t have to die 
everybody dies  sally 
the thing is  to die well 
jack  that s not
the survivor you promised me 
no  it s not 
what horatius said was 
 how can a man die better 
 than facing fearful odds 
drones  get inside  get inside 
 for the ashes of his fathers 
 and the temples of his gods 
i created you  jack 
i am your god 
fuck you  sally 
earth  after the war 
three years have passed
since i saw your face 
i wonder if i come to
you at night  in dreams 
in the day  as memories 
do i haunt your hours
the way you haunted mine 
and i wonder if you see me
when you look at her 
mommy  look 
if we have souls  they are
made of the love we share 
undimmed by time 
unbound by death 
for three years  i searched
for the house he built 
i knew it had to be out there
