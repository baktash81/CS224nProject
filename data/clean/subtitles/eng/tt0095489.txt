before the ape
and the elephant as well 
before the wolf 
the bison  the whale 
before the mammoth
and the mastodon
in the time
of the dinosaurs 
come on 
now the dinosaurs
were of two kinds 
some had flat teeth
and ate the leaves of trees 
and some had sharp teeth
for eating meat 
and they preyed upon
the leaf eaters 
then it happened that
the leaves began to die 
the mighty beasts  who
appeared to rule the earth 
were ruled  in truth 
by the leaf 
desperate for food 
some of the dinosaur herds
struck out toward the west 
searching for
the great valley 
a land still lush
and green 
it was a journey
toward life 
it was a march
of many dangers 
sharpteeth
stalked the herds 
waiting to seize
any who strayed 
the leaf eaters stopped only
to hatch their young 
ha 
aah 
mama 
hmm 
mmm 
mmm 
mmm 
some of the young
seemed born without fear 
yet   
even hatching
could be dangerous 
one herd had only
a single baby 
their last hope
for the future 
and they called him
 littlefoot  
here i am 
aw 
don t be frightened 
come out 
mmm 
all that remained
of his herd was his mother 
grandmother 
and his grandfather 
he knew them by sight 
by scent 
and by their love 
he knew they would
be together always 
now  you be careful 
my littlefoot 
ahh 
aah 
beautiful littlefoot 
mother  is this
all there is to eat 
oh  i m sorry  my dear 
the land
has been changing 
that is why we must walk
as far as we can each day 
until we reach
the great valley 
littlefoot  quickly 
come here 
look  up there 
a tree star 
it is very special 
a tree star 
it is very special 
it ll help you
grow strong 
where we are going 
there are so many
of these leaves 
come along 
the great valley is filled
with green food like this 
more than you could
ever eat 
and more fresh 
cool water
than you could
ever drink 
it s a wonderful 
beautiful place 
where we can
live happily
with many more
of our own kind 
gee  when will
we get there 
the bright circle must
pass over us many times 
and we must
follow it each day
to where
it touches the ground 
have you ever seen
the great valley 
no 
well  how do you know
it s really there 
some things you see
with your eyes 
others you see
with your heart 
i don t understand 
mother

well  why 
oh  don t worry so much 
when we reach
the great valley 
there will be
many  many longnecks
for you to play with 
i wish we were there now 
well  it s a long way yet 
past the great rock
that looks like a longneck 
and past the mountains
that burn

but we ll get there 
hey  hopper

whoa 
mother 
run  run 
look out

mother 
daddy 
in this time
of the clash of continents 
a great earthquake
split the land 
herds were divided 
families were cut in two 
littlefoot was separated
from his grandparents 
cera 
mama  daddy 
cera was on one side
of the divide 
her parents were
on the other 
mother 
mother 
mother  where are you 
oh 
mother 
mother 
oh

i m
not sure i can 
littlefoot 
yes  you can

dear  sweet littlefoot 
do you remember the way
to the great valley 
i guess so  but why
do i have to know 
you re going
to be with me 
i ll be with you 
even if
you can t see me 
what do you mean
if i can t see you 
i can always see you 
littlefoot 
let your heart
guide you 
it whispers 
so  listen closely 
mother 
mother 
mmm 
mmmmm 
hey 
what s going on here 
what s your problem 
you re not hurt 
it s not fair 
she should
have known better 
that was a
sharptooth 
it s all her fault 
all whose fault 
mother s 
oh   
i see 
i see 
why did i wander
so far from home 
oh  it s not
your fault 
it s not your
mother s fault 
now  you pay attention
to old rooter 
yeah  but   
it is nobody s fault 
the great circle
of life has begun 
but  you see 
not all of us arrive
together at the end 
what ll i do 
i miss her so much 
and you ll always
miss her 
but she ll
always be with you
as long as you remember
the things she taught you 
in a way 
you ll never be apart 
for you are still
a part of each other 
my tummy hurts 
well  that  too 
will go in time 
little fella 
only in time 
at first 
littlefoot could only
think about his mother 
he hardly
noticed his hunger
and forgot about
the great valley
and that he must
somehow reach it 
littlefoot 
littlefoot 
dear littlefoot 
do you remember the way
to the great valley 
follow the bright circle
past the great rock

and past the mountains
that burn 
i ll be in your heart 
littlefoot 
let your heart guide you 
mother 
mother 
mother 
it s you 
wait  mother

then littlefoot
knew for certain
that he was alone 
and that though
the great valley
was far away
and the journey there
was perilous 
he would have
to find his way 
or the chain of life
would be broken
