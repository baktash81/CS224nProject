who s the girl on the couch 
who is she 
lucie 
lucie  who 
lucie jurin 
and you 
you are 
anna assaoui 
we ve been trying to calling
to the phone here for hours 
the phone was off the hook 
this shouldn t never happened 
can you tell me what went on here 
what are you doing here 
lucie jurin actually escaped from us
15 years ago 
correct 
right 
back then  we were not quite assure 
we were disorganized 
gabrielle never should have let her escape 
after 15 years  the child found her 
i was impressed by her junasity as for the rest 
lucie is just a victim 
like all of the others 
it is so easy to create a victim 
young lady  so easy 
you lock someone in a room with no light 
soon they begin to suffer 
then you feed that suffering 
slowly methodically 
systematically  coldly 
for a long time 
you then witness your subject 
going through several mental states 
the mental trauma starts to break them 
and that small  easily opened crack 
makes them see things 
that don t exist in our world 
your friend lucie 
what was her vision  hmm
did she see any thing 
not even one monster 
did she see things
that wanted to hurt her 
hmm 
a dead girl 
i knew it 
a dead girl 
the one that you found  sarah dutreuil 
saws up the insects 
scrawling all over her skin 
she d rather cut off her own arm
than living with that fear 
people ignored the existence of suffering 
that s how our world sees it 
yet everyone s a victim 
martyrs are very rare 
a true martyr is a special person 
they are exceptional beings 
they been sent paralyzing pain young lady 
they can survive total deprivation 
they carry all the sins of the world 
it s their sacrifice 
they transcend themselves completely 
do you understand 
they are transfigured 
long shang province in 1912 
she didn t believe in god 
she stole a hen 
but it cost her dearly 
in the photograph you can see 
she s still very alive 
look at her eyes 
jouans lussac  1945  this woman was a grocer 
she slept with a nazi  her fellow frenchman  
  didn t care for that  so she had to pay 
look at her eyes 
she was still alive 
1960  a hospital in birmingham 
just an ordinary young housewife 
an atheist  riddle with terminal cancer 
morphine had lost his effect for her 
her eyes tell the story 
beaten with a pipe by her jealous husband 
after his release from prison 
crushed in a car wreck  from which she couldn t be pulled out 
a leukemia victim in her final moments of life 
suffering excruciating pain from a rare disease 
17 hours of mind numbing agony 
starving to death after 2 years 
you know everyone of them 
was the same 
each one of them was still alive 
when they were photographed 
no one can try to tell me that the concept of martyrdom
was strictly an invention of the religious 
we tried everything  even with children 
and we proven that its women 
that are much more responsive to transfiguration 
yes   young women 
that s how it is 
aah 
aah 
aaahhh 
aaaaahhhhh 
aaahhh 
aaahhh 
aaaaahhhhh 
aah 
anna 
are you there 
anna  i m here 
yes  lucie 
why aren t you never scared 
i am scared sometimes 
not like i m 
i didn t go through what you did 
how do you stop being scared 
just let go 
you think so 
just let go 
and if i can t  will you be there 
yes 
i miss you 
you re not scared now 
not scared now 
not scared now 
you ll be all right 
your suffering is almost over 
there s only one more stage 
the last one 
you ll be all right 
you won t have to protect yourself ever again 
it s okay 
  is she still holding up 
  that s amazing 
michel 
what s going on 
michel  come quickly 
just now  when i went down to feed her 
  are you certain 
  mam  i couldn t been more certain 
i have never seen such an expression 
she s like god  she s completely like god 
her face is like something 
mam  it s like 
her eyes  i swear  she no longer sees anything around her 
but is she still   
yes  she s alive 
mam  certain she is 
have you seen it then 
the other world 
yesterday afternoon 
in this very house 
at around 12 15 
anna assaoui became a martyred 
let us take a moment to pay our respect 
anna assaoui is a rare individual 
in our 17 years of research 
anna is only the fourth person to have attained that stage 
and the first 
yes  my friends 
the first one to have reported
what she has seen then 
between 12 15 and 2 30 p m 
miss anna assaoui saw beyond death into the other world 
you heard me correctly 
her state of ecstasy  
  lasted two hours and 15 minutes 
this was not a near death experience 
there is no doubt that our martyrdom was authentic 
at 2 30 p m   she came out of this state 
at 3 05 
on a spoke 
at this moment 
she is still alive 
although no longer communicating 
mademoiselle heard her full testimony 
and my friends  this testimony 
will be shared with you in just a few moments 
mademoiselle 
they re waiting 
very well etienne 
she really told you 
of course 
was it clear 
like crystal 
and precise 
i can see no other interpretation  etienne 
i see  mademoiselle 
etienne 
mademoiselle 
have you ever tried to imagine the other world 
everything all right 
  well have you 
  i m afraid not 
keep doubting etienne 
martyr  noun 
from the greek  martyr s 
witness 
seppuku paradigm  
  there was no tender age   
  it was tough from the start   
  but you re holding my hand   
  we re all that we have   
  i cry when you bleed   
  and i bleed when you cry   
  i don t want to lie   
  i love what you are   
  i would do anything   
  give you everything   
  i ve seen where you ve been in your eyes   
  your bruises and cuts   
  they re ghosts from the past   
  there s nowhere to run   
  nowhere to hide   
  the pain will go  way   
  yet i slowly realize   
  i miss you so deeply   
  i want to be where you are   
  i will do anything   
  give up everything   
  i ve seen through this hell of your eyes   
  of your eyes
