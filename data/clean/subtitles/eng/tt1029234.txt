whos the girl on the couch
who is she
lucie
lucie who
lucie jurin
and you
you are
anna assaoui
weve been trying to calling
to the phone here for hours
the phone was off the hook
this shouldnt never happened
can you tell me what went on here
what are you doing here
lucie jurin actually escaped from us
15 years ago
correct
right
back then we were not quite assure
we were disorganized
gabrielle never should have let her escape
after 15 years the child found her
i was impressed by her junasity as for the rest
lucie is just a victim
like all of the others
it is so easy to create a victim
young lady so easy
you lock someone in a room with no light
soon they begin to suffer
then you feed that suffering
slowly methodically
systematically coldly
for a long time
you then witness your subject
going through several mental states
the mental trauma starts to break them
and that small easily opened crack
makes them see things
that dont exist in our world
your friend lucie
what was her vision hmm
did she see any thing
not even one monster
did she see things
that wanted to hurt her
hmm
a dead girl
i knew it
a dead girl
the one that you found sarah dutreuil
saws up the insects
scrawling all over her skin
shed rather cut off her own arm
than living with that fear
people ignored the existence of suffering
thats how our world sees it
yet everyones a victim
martyrs are very rare
a true martyr is a special person
they are exceptional beings
they been sent paralyzing pain young lady
they can survive total deprivation
they carry all the sins of the world
its their sacrifice
they transcend themselves completely
do you understand
they are transfigured
long shang province in 1912
she didnt believe in god
she stole a hen
but it cost her dearly
in the photograph you can see
shes still very alive
look at her eyes
jouanslussac 1945 this woman was a grocer
she slept with a nazi her fellow frenchman
didnt care for that so she had to pay
look at her eyes
she was still alive
1960 a hospital in birmingham
just an ordinary young housewife
an atheist riddle with terminal cancer
morphine had lost his effect for her
her eyes tell the story
beaten with a pipe by her jealous husband
after his release from prison
crushed in a car wreck from which she couldnt be pulled out
a leukemia victim in her final moments of life
suffering excruciating pain from a rare disease
17 hours of mind numbing agony
starving to death after 2 years
you know everyone of them
was the same
each one of them was still alive
when they were photographed
no one can try to tell me that the concept of martyrdom
was strictly an invention of the religious
we tried everything even with children
and we proven that its women
that are much more responsive to transfiguration
yesyoung women
thats how it is
aah
aah
aaahhh
aaaaahhhhh
aaahhh
aaahhh
aaaaahhhhh
aah
anna
are you there
anna im here
yes lucie
why arent you never scared
i am scared sometimes
not like im
i didnt go through what you did
how do you stop being scared
just let go
you think so
just let go
and if i cant will you be there
yes
i miss you
youre not scared now
not scared now
not scared now
youll be all right
your suffering is almost over
theres only one more stage
the last one
youll be all right
you wont have to protect yourself ever again
its okay
is she still holding up
thats amazing
michel
whats going on
michelcome quickly
just now when i went down to feed her
are you certain
mam i couldnt been more certain
i have never seen such an expression
shes like god shes completely like god
her face is like something
mam its like
her eyes i swear she no longer sees anything around her
but is she still
yes shes alive
mam certain she is
have you seen it then
the other world
yesterday afternoon
in this very house
at around 1215
anna assaoui became a martyred
let us take a moment to pay our respect
anna assaoui is a rare individual
in our 17 years of research
anna is only the fourth person to have attained that stage
and the first
yes my friends
the first one to have reported
what she has seen then
between 1215 and 230 pm
miss anna assaoui saw beyond death into the other world
you heard me correctly
her state of ecstasy
lasted two hours and 15 minutes
this was not a neardeath experience
there is no doubt that our martyrdom was authentic
at 230 pmshe came out of this state
at 305
on a spoke
at this moment
she is still alive
although no longer communicating
mademoiselle heard her full testimony
and my friends this testimony
will be shared with you in just a few moments
mademoiselle
theyre waiting
very well etienne
she really told you
of course
was it clear
like crystal
and precise
i can see no other interpretation etienne
i see mademoiselle
etienne
mademoiselle
have you ever tried to imagine the other world
everything all right
well have you
im afraid not
keep doubting etienne
martyr noun
from the greek martyrs
witness
seppuku paradigm
there was no tender age
it was tough from the start
but youre holding my hand
were all that we have
i cry when you bleed
and i bleed when you cry
i dont want to lie
i love what you are
i would do anything
give you everything
ive seen where youve been in your eyes
your bruises and cuts
theyre ghosts from the past
theres nowhere to run
nowhere to hide
the pain will go way
yet i slowly realize
i miss you so deeply
i want to be where you are
i will do anything
give up everything
ive seen through this hell of your eyes
of your eyes
