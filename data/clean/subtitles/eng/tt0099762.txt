would want to publish a defense
of d h  lawrence   
and that his words are considered
an incitement to sex 
  then he said   you write about sex    
  with some authority  miss nin 
you must ve led a rather free life 
free 
you must ve had a lot
of experience 
you know  affairs 
i m interested in how you came   
to have such insights
into the erotic 
for literature 
yes  i love proust and   
i suppose my real awakening
came when my husband hugo and i   
first arrived in paris
and rented a bachelor apartment   
for the summer 
one day  i was tidying up 
as i was going through the closets   
where the owner left his belongings   
i discovered   
in that closet   
i became familiar with the endless
varieties of erotic experience 
come here 
  hugo 
  i thought you might need a lift 
are you all right  pussy willow 
  he kissed me 
  what  oh  my god 
it was just one kiss 
he kisses me once 
then he caresses all of my body 
he seeks my breasts   
and my most secret 
sensitive part 
his hands are deft 
i m tempted by unknown pleasures 
when i see that i have let him
be aroused   
i let him release his desire
between my legs 
i just let him   
out of pity 
i tell hugo   
only part of the story 
pussy willow 
remember to meet me at 8 00 tonight 
oh  hugo  would you mind very much
if i didn t go this evening 
i would mind 
i m sorry  but all they talk about are
bad loans  trusts or estate planning 
estate planning can be very creative 
look  the bank is how we got to paris 
i need this job and i admit
i sometimes enjoy it  why not 
why not 
you re changing into someone else 
you are even beginning to smell
like the bank 
i m working so you can write 
i need to know people who are alive 
you re not consummating 
you re holding back 
do it again 
i can t seem to concentrate anymore 
eduardo 
my life  sometimes i think
i need something else 
an older man 
a man stronger than i am 
you like to make me suffer 
i ve loved you
since we were children  anais 
but  i ve always had a fear that   
i wouldn t be able to 
look at them 
they re so exquisite 
if i were a man 
i d be swept away 
they don t move me like you do 
hell of a place you got here  hugo 
peaceful 
been here long 
  just since the crash 
  since the crash  how d you live before 
we lived well 
this is henry miller  the american
writer osborn is putting up  my wife 
  anais nin 
  how are you  anais 
eduardo sanchez  anais  cousin 
anais  you ought to read henry s stuff 
he s got it over d h  lawrence 
  i d love to read what you ve written 
  henry hasn t been published yet 
and you re comparing him to lawrence 
i don t want to be compared to lawrence 
he would ve hated the way i write 
  henry writes for the man on the street 
  i don t care for his writing 
anais has been writing a book
about lawrence 
perhaps his sexuality
is too strong for you 
too strong  he s childish 
he s prudish 
the french have been writing
about this  rabelais  flaubert 
i can t imagine any modern writer
not to owe a debt to lawrence 
we should eat 
he makes too much out of sex 
he makes a damn gospel out of it 
to my way of thinking 
sex is natural   
like birth or death 
i m not interested in literature
or poetry as we know it 
what are you interested in 
  henry writes about fucking 
  fucking 
i m writing about self liberation 
  it s definitely about fucking 
  we should eat something 
amelia s waiting 
i flipped through more pages 
and i realize   
this is my own novel i m reading
with some joker s name on it   
written in french  being sold
in the best bookstore in paris 
  unbelievable 
  how s that possible 
remember last year when some guy stole
my briefcase with my manuscript in it 
this guy swiped my manuscript  but what
he doesn t realize is i ll get him 
the souffle is from
an old family recipe 
so this is a souffle 
i hope it s substantial enough 
this joker doesn t know i ll get him
because i m a copyright lawyer 
i ll go after him
like i went after the other joker 
  the guy who stole your play 
  that s on broadway 
that s on broadway   
i told you this already 
about how this guy must ve stolen
my play out of my briefcase 
i d be a well received writer by now
if it weren t for these jokers 
but i ll get them  i m not taking
any chances  this is my new baby 
you re laughing at me 
i just feel so good  wonderful 
what a fine moment we have here 
a free lunch 
fire in the fireplace 
wonderful wines 
the colors blue and orange 
it s wonderful  no other word for it 
what do you write 
poetry or something 
most of my writing
is in these diaries 
no  i never let anyone read it 
i never show it to anyone   
except hugo   
sometimes 
i always wanted to read the captive 
la prisonnier 
i want you to have it 
i ll borrow it  thanks 
pussy willow 
i used to go to the six day bike races

  are you set  eduardo 
  i warn you i used to race

  i d love to read something he wrote 
  fat chance  he ll never get published 
i ve met henry miller 
he is virile  flamboyant 
he is a man life intoxicates 
he is like me 
but he doesn t know it yet 
henry s quite a character 
good night

  let me help you

osborn said he d be home 
and i want to surprise henry 
i thought you could use a hand

hiya  kid 
slumming  huh 
i went to osborn s place 
he told me where to find you 
i brought my typewriter 
i thought you should have it 
can we go and sit down somewhere 
why not 
there s a little cafe back here 
come on 
that actress in the film   
she reminds you of someone 
a woman who obsesses you 
i know that feeling 
i m often obsessed 
you oughta eat something  kid 
you eat like a bird 
all right  i ll tell ya 
june appeared like an angel 
i offered her a fool s fate 
she was a taxi dancer 
i paid my dime 
she put her head on my shoulder 
but then the lies began 
she told me her mother
was a gypsy 
her father was a count 
later i saw a film and realized she
swiped her childhood out of the film 
and so 
so i married her 
she gave me the courage to quit my job
to write full time  she believed in me 
somehow she got some money so
we could buy strawberries in the winter 
we re broke 
living in a dump in brooklyn   
but we re living like kings 
then one day she meets an artist 
brings her home to live with us 
pretty soon we re supporting jean  too 
how is she getting the money 
  pop 
  pop 
pop s her scam 
i found out about pop only after
she barged in with a fistful of money   
and suggests i go to paris to write 
then she ll join me later 
i take one look into her lying eyes 
and say   
 anything you say  
pack my bags
and i m off to europe 
but   
i m not quite the sap
she takes me for 
something tells me to double back   
and take a see 
but when i confront her 
she gets furious with me 
she said we would ve starved
without pop   pop s my patron saint  
your patron saint 
yeah  that s what she calls him 
only she s been telling pop
that it s her writing 
that s why pop s been buying it 
because of her 
how you doing  bonjour 
and i should be grateful 
she s done it all for me 
then she says   i love you  
and everything else vanishes 
in that moment  i lived eternities 
why does she get angry  hurt 
jealous or cruel 
why does she lie 
that i can t understand 
maybe you re not asking
the right questions 
oh  yeah 
what would you ask 
i d asked 
what makes her lies necessary 
what is she afraid of 
who is she afraid of 
the kinds of things a woman would ask 
a woman 
excuse me  pal  could you spring
for a few francs  i m short today 
beat it 
i could give you some money
if you need it 
thanks  that s swell of ya 
careful

you fall in love
with people s minds 
i m afraid i could lose you
to henry 
don t be ridiculous 
he s so rough 
he calls me  kid  
i hate him 
he s a parasite  an egoist 
maybe it s just jealousy 
what are you jealous of 
his life seems
so full of pain and chaos 
he has someone who drives him
to pain and chaos 
anais  meet my wife june 
thanks for taking care of henry 
he didn t describe you right

or some lies

henry sees a lecher under every rock 
you know how men get 
do you love women 
what do you mean

i always wanted you to be   
dostoyevsky

  good 
i struggled  suffered   
for this 
this isn t me 
this is not me 
of course it s you 
it s the you inside me 
it s a distortion 
henry  look at me 
look 
you can t see me or anyone
as they are 
i wanted dostoyevsky 
who can be dostoyevsky with you 
you make that impossible 
what do you want 
  what do i want 
  yeah 
after i brought the world to you 
after i told you all of my stories 
sing my praises 
make me an admirable character 
  i m not a portrait painter 
  i ll say you re not 
look what you ve done to anais 
you make everything ugly 
beauty is a joke to you 
you re so negative 
you re a failure as a writer 
you re not a man 
you re a child 
you use women 
you used me  you fucker 
you fuck 
get rid of her 
i ll drive you wild 
i love you 
i wanna be drunk 
and make   
you drunk 
because i m intimidated by you 
i need to feel free to say anything
and know that you ll forgive me 
i want to tell you things
so you won t stumble through life 
i ve done the vilest things   
foulest things 
but i ve done them superbly 
i feel innocent now 
do you believe that 
you are innocent 
i want to be innocent like you 
i want to experience everything
you ve experienced 
take care of henry for me 
i ll be leaving in the morning 
what 
the morning 
but when will you come back 
maybe soon 
maybe never 
there is so much i wish
i could ve done with you 
i wish i could ve taken opium with you 
give me your wrist 
no  you have so few things 
i wanted to give you more 
i wanted to hold you 
she s crazy  don t you see it 
no  i don t see 
i don t care 
she s just using you 
you just don t understand 
you re jealous of her 
no  i m not 
besides  you ll never see her again 
where did you get this 
show me 
does she think she can love anything
in you i haven t loved 
henry  you may have genius
and passion   
but something is definitely missing 
oh  yeah  what 
compassion 
compassion for whom 
june  for instance 
might as well have compassion
for the moon 
i m going to write a book about june 
i m writing about her 
i know more than anybody will know
about her 
i m talking about something
totally different  as a woman 
from the inside out 
i can get into the poetry of june 
hey  she s my fucking wife 
you don t understand
your own fucking wife 
i kissed her 
write about whatever you want
to write about  for christ s sake 
and more power to ya 
  i gotta get back to work 
  stay longer if you can 
she s been under stress 
just getting back on her feet 
say  they ve got haitian drums
up there 
that fellow said i might sit in 
i saw your true nature
when you were dancing 
you don t understand 
maybe i m just a peasant 
and only whores can understand me 
you wanna dance 
dance 
move your legs wider 
i love you 
i need you 
what are you doing 
you re driving me wild 
perhaps i am a demon to be able
to pass from henry s arms into hugo s 
hugo lies next to me
as i write this 
i love hugo 
and i feel innocent 
did i ever tell you about when i was
a little boy growing up in puerto rico 
my father used to take me
to the carnival 
there were wild drums beating
and frightening masks 
there was something going on that was
terrifying  that i didn t understand 
i said to my father 
 i m not afraid 
but give me your hand  
i have to go 
hello  mr  richards 
hello  hugo 
mr  grant can t join us till friday 
anais  i don t know how much
i dare write you 
i would call you 
only i m afraid hugo would answer 
god forgive if this letter s
ever opened by mistake 
i can t help it 
i want you  i love you 
i ve been living with you constantly 
but i ve been afraid to tell you 
i thought it would terrify you 
but today as i watched dreyer s
passion of joan of arc   
i saw the mad monk
played by antonin artaud 
i thought of you like joan   
in all your youth and purity
and single minded madness 
and i saw myself in artaud 
a hungering monk in love with you
and with my madness   
and your madness 
and the demon in artaud s eyes
was like the demon in your eyes 
we fit so well together 
with hugo  it s so difficult sometimes 
we have to use vaseline 
his penis is so big 
but you and i fit so well 
oh  henry  i want to know
what you know 
i want my life to match your life 
look at that  will ya 
isn t that something 
just read your goddamn book
on d h  lawrence   
and my  oh  my
it s one hell of a book 
shows me i didn t know shit
about lawrence when i spoke 
who am i to go shooting off
at the mouth about him 
he was much greater  finer
than i ever thought 
never mind how he failed
or triumphed as a man 
as an artist  did he succeed 
i say magnificently 
he tried to liberate literature 
and that s our task 
liberation  freedom 
let s toast to lawrence 
let s toast to our defects 
toast   
to our friendship 
drink cold  piss warm 
to henry 
fuck the huns 
you know who i really am 
it s only me from over the sea 
i m barnacle bill the sailor
i m all lit up like a christmas tree
i m barnacle bill the sailor
i ll sail the sea until i croak
i ll fight and swear and drink and smoke
but i can t swim a bloody stroke
i m barnacle bill the sailor
i ll put my mast in whom i please
i m barnacle bill the sailor
i ll drink and fight and fuck and smoke
but i can t swim a bloody stroke
i m barnacle bill the sailor
barnacle bill the sailor
perverts yourselves 
  fuck you 
  jack 
  what 
  say  fuck you  jack 
fuck you  jack 
twelve meters 
pull it 
yeah  scram 
everybody says sex is obscene 
the only true obscenity is war 
i d believe only in a god   
who understood how to dance 
isn t that something 
nietzsche says that at the same time   
the huns and germany are gearing up 
perverting  what he says 
we re given this gift 
the ability to understand 
yet no one wants to understand 
we re given the ability to read 
read nietzsche  thomas mann   
read spengler  joyce  rambaud 
read fucking alice in wonderland 
huh  osborn 
everything s out of whack 
people just worry about money
and deny their inner self 
what is money  anyway 
there s an old portuguese saying   
 if shit had value 
the poor wouldn t have asses  
money  money 
they walk through the night crowd
protected by money   
lulled by money  dulled by money 
no single object anywhere
that is not money 
money everywhere and still not enough 
then no money or little money
or less money or more money 
but money  always money 
if you have money or don t have money 
it s the money that counts 
and money makes money 
but what makes money make money 
i say  what the hell 
we gotta die to the world
like the clowns  right  clowns 
i ve never seen the sun rise in paris 
i ve never been up all night 
i ve never been with a woman
i could be so sincere with 
i feel so free to write now 
i ll help you 
and i ll help you 
i feel so pure 
so strong 
so new  henry 
you and i together 
not any man or woman together 
i m gonna demand everything of you 
even the impossible 
because you encourage it 
maybe i should get down on my knees
and worship you 
i m gonna undress you 
vulgarize you a bit 
lift up your dress 
no  not here 
don t look around 
you little aristocrat 
don t care 
i want to fuck you   
teach you things   
humiliate you a little 
wrap your leg around me 
i m gonna make you come with me 
remarkable 
this is one of the most beautiful things
i ve ever read 
i ve never shown this diary
to anyone before 
no one will ever know these things   
but you 
you re becoming all the things
you wished to be as a little girl 
  i had a cricket 
  what 
a little cricket in a cage 
i love your accent 
i carried it everywhere with me 
but when we arrived in america 
they took it away at immigration 
the only thing they let me keep
in america was my diary 
and my accent 
i love you at 11 
i love you now 
i will love you at 100 
here  take a look 
what have you got here 
this is good 
powerful 
yours  too 
you tell the truth with such   
delicacy 
  i hope you don t mind 
  mind 
why should i mind 
i welcome constructive criticism 
good 
if it s constructive 
  what are you doing 
  just a few things 
here it s all shrieks   
and abstracts 
it s too melodramatic 
you gotta take time to expand 
you re enjoying this 
  what 
  cutting me up 
i don t want to write
the way you write 
i don t want you to write
the way i write 
you ve got to write in your own voice 
i m just making a few suggestions 
it s tight in places 
here 
read it out loud
and see how it sounds 
  i won t give you that pleasure 
  pleasure 
hold on a minute here 
can t you take it 
you gotta take a few taps on the chin 
a few taps on the chin 
amuse yourself with someone else 
a prizefighter  for instance 
you re right exactly 
a prizefighter 
you ve got to get knocked down
occasionally to acquire ring tactics 
the strategy 
the art of fighting 
you can t just shadowbox in your room 
you wouldn t last two minutes
when you step into the ring 
i am not interested
in stepping into a ring with you 
the world will give us
plenty of beatings 
we need each other s support 
should i criticize you
like an outsider 
should i say you write
caricatures 
that you write only from a man s point
of view and can t understand women 
should i say that sometimes there s
a touch of the brute in your writing 
that you re too much of a realist 
what s the matter 
can t you take it 
like a prizefighter 
knock it off 
you want to fight  huh 
don t 
leave it  it looks nice that way 
wild 
loose 
you never like the way i look 
i do love your hair 
i just think it shouldn t be so severe 
so tight 
like my writing 
no  not like your writing 
i love your writing 
i believe in you 
last night i thought that you were
the woman i should ve been married to 
you re always ironizing with me 
 ironizing   there s no such word 
it s  to be ironic  
look it up 
then he steals my ideas
and puts them in his novel 
henry wouldn t do that 
i m sure of it 
somehow   
he got into my briefcase
and swiped my ideas 
those phrases are mine 
that way of expression 
that rhapsodizing  it s mine 
nietzsche 
i introduced him to nietzsche 
i introduced him to hugo and you 
he stole you from hugo 
  don t  richard 
  he stole you from me 
that s true 
it was my idea to become your lover 
he betrayed me by stealing you from me
and from my best friend  your husband 
this man is treacherous to the core 
this neanderthal from brooklyn
is trying to murder me 
for all his pretended friendship  his
most intimate friends are only fodder   
for the unrolling of his own sanctified
destiny  his own creative urges 
i leave the two of you
to your destiny 
and one more thing 
no more sex in my apartment 
i won t stand for it 
i won t stand for it 
i love that guy 
he understands me 
even though he is   
pas maintenant  later 
even though he is ironizing 
i have only three desires now 
to eat   
to sleep   
and  uh   
and 
  jerks out there 
  it s just the art students ball 
maybe you just don t want it tonight 
it s fine 
i understand 
it s natural 
i ve read about such moments 
it happens to women  too 
only women can conceal it 
sorry 
don t be 
you feel that you have to fuck me
or i ll be disappointed 
but you don t always
have to fuck me 
don t say that word 
what word 
fuck 
it just bothers me now 
maybe it s the accent 
maybe it s just because you can t fuck 
it s important not to imagine
terrible things   
like being impotent from now on 
it s nothing 
we should just laugh about it 
i love you  pussy willow 
i love you  too  hugo 
i gave myself with such feelings
against henry   
that i experienced
a great physical pleasure 
my first infidelity to henry   
was with my own husband 
i ve changed 
i feel restless  spirited   
adventurous 
to be truthful  i hope secretly
to meet someone else 
i have erotic imaginings 
i want pleasure 
every time i go out with you
i love you more than ever 
you seem so wild tonight 
tonight i could do anything 
i could  too 
we need to think of something
that will stimulate us both 
anything you say  kiddo 
henry told me about this place 
this ought to be something 
wait here 
  i m with you 
  we ll just look 
what s an exhibition 
then you must choose two 
an exhibition is   
us watching a man and a woman
doing it 
no man  only women 
one pretends to be the man 
it is better that way 
n est ce pas 
of course 
you will not be disappointed 
you will see everything 
and now you must choose 
her 
and   
there are 66 ways
in which to make love 
oh  really 
they will show you love
in a taxi 
love when one of the partners
is sleepy 
love in the street 
etcetera  etcetera 
you like something else 
yes  stop pretending to be a man 
would you like to join us 
as you wish  you re the boss 
anais  what 
i love your green eyes  eduardo 
i want to show you things 
teach you things 
i want you to relax 
relax  eduardo 
i had a dream 
a nightmare 
june had suddenly returned 
we shut ourselves in a room 
i began to undress 
i begged her to undress 
i asked to let me see between her legs 
as she lay over me   
i felt a penis touching me 
aren t you glad 
aren t you glad 
i m passing through a crisis  eduardo 
be careful  anais 
abnormal pleasures kill the taste
for the normal ones 
i hate you  henry   
because i now realize i love you
as i have never loved anyone 
i miss your voice 
your hands  your body   
your tenderness 
your bearishness and your goodness 
most of all 
i miss our friendship 
i m finished 
pussy willow 
i m home 
i m home 
henry s exhausted 
hasn t slept for two days 
he s just finished his novel 
henry 
this is wonderful 
stupendous 
  come and join us 
  lay down with us  henry 
i hope you don t mind 
anais was reading this 
i m a nosy guy 
so i took a peek 
i love it 
i ve been trying
to write something about it 
about how necessary this book is
for our times 
you give us a blood transfusion 
  beautiful 
  thanks 
wait till june reads this 
she ll be so thrilled
that you ve finished your book 
each mention of her name   
each page i read is painful 
well  this was a swan song 
it was a way to understand her
so i could free myself from her 
  it s finished now 
  not yet 
  now we ve got to get it published 
  published 
who will publish it 
i know what they ll say 
there s even laws against
what i ve written 
but i feel good now 
i m ready to celebrate my failure 
i won t let you be a failure 
i ll make the world listen to you 
i promise 
i m ready now to call on the pope   
and all the kings   
and all the editors and publishers
in the world to get them to support you 
it s anais 
  eduardo 
  hello  henry 
  where s hugo 
  hugo s gone on business 
osborn s gone  too 
gone crazy 
really 
totally 
we re celebrating osborn s madness 
this is a rare occasion 
it doesn t happen every day  i hope
he s really insane and not faking it 
  they came and took him away 
  he was a monster 
that was his best side 
we ve got the whole place to ourselves 
you ever see what
a good contortionist can do 
yeah 
i ll get you something to drink 
sorry i couldn t keep in touch 
i thought of you every day 
you know me with writing 
i have a terrible time 
i don t have the gift
like you and henry 
i found your book
lying around here 
i hope you don t mind 
i took a peek 
house of incest 
it s nice 
is this character sabina
supposed to be me 
 the muffled  close half talk
of soft fleshed women 
deep into each other
we turned our hollowed eyes  
it seems like poetry sort of 
it s so damn sweet of you
to try to write something about me 
i really   
i really expected something more   
i don t know 
more real 
more real 
yeah  more about  you know  life 
hey  don t get upset 
some of it s really beautiful 
i promise i ll read it again 
things have been so damn tough for me 
the acting didn t pan out 
then jean  my friend  left 
anais  what s happened to henry 
he s so changed 
june  i don t know 
i don t know what to say 
i ve been busy 
i ve seen him occasionally  we work
on our writing together sometimes 
but  i don t know 
i ve been seeing someone 
  you mean you have a lover 
  yes 
that man you came with 
yes  eduardo 
anais  i m so happy for you 
i don t know who i came back for 
don t let it come between us 
please 
i need your faith 
that could be good luck  too 
could be 
jack  you ve come 
how are you 
june  i d like you to meet jack   
the man who wants to publish my book 
  my wife june 
  hiya  jack 
nice to meet you  mrs  miller 
i feel i already know you intimately
from reading henry s book 
yeah  what do you think 
i think it s strong meat 
that s how we ll market it 
  what s our cut 
  your cut 
lt ll be 5  
a crummy 5  
henry spends years
writing the book 
lives like a bum 
busts his nuts 
  stay out of this  june 
  i scrape by and do without 
and pour my heart and soul in making him
some kind of dostoyevsky 
and all we get is 5  
with me  the percentage
will mean something 
what does  mean something  mean 
i believe it s a fair deal 
well  i ll be 
of course  if you don t want
to publish it   
henry just doesn t get business 
let s us talk 
by all means  but as i ve said 
before we can do anything   
it s absolutely necessary to have
the money to print it 
jack  i ve told you 
i ll get the money 
i guess i was naive about
how things work in your business 
i hope i didn t upset you 
i was wondering if some advance
might be possible 
or maybe there s room
to improve in the percentage 
let s not discuss it now 
here is not the place 
maybe you know a place
where we could have lunch 
i certainly do 
a marvelous place 
it s done then 
it s been so good to meet you 
really  it s been wonderful
having you 
you  too 
good night 
  yes 
  see you 
good bye 
who s he trying to kid 
a crummy 5  
he hasn t dealt with
this brooklyn girl yet 
  let s go for a nightcap  henry 
  go ahead  we ll join you later 
  always merry and bright 
  to you  too 
  i should go 
  no  anais 
don t go  you can catch up
with eduardo later 
all right  eduardo 
say  you know   
i don t know 
i was thinking maybe it s not time
to publish henry s book just now 
not publish 
what the hell you talking about 
i m talking about the crappy deal 
and the fact that you re
taking advantage of anais 
and hugo  too 
they re not made of gold  henry 
am i right  anais 
yes  but    no 
we believe we have to publish it 
i ll get it published 
the right way 
just like i always have 
we ve always managed to survive 
you and me 
besides  it needs work 
  what 
  it s not ready 
it s better than
when i first read it   
but it could be even better 
there s too much anger in the book 
too much anger 
too much fucking anger 
even anais agrees that you
distorted me in your book 
she had to write her own book 
  isn t that right 
  no 
i did tell june you failed to perceive
certain things 
  don t 
  after all i ve done for him 
he owes me for all the years
i sacrificed 
your sacrifices just add
to your greatness 
  i don t owe you a thing 
  you don t what 
what henry really means is   
for christ s sake 
can t you see what she s doing 
  don t yell at me 
  he treats you like a child 
  she s a woman  henry 
  i know she s a woman 
  i ll bet you do 
  what the fuck do you mean by that 
i m leaving 
how can you treat her this way 
you re drunk 
so what 
you re weak 
i hate when you get weak 
be a man 
god  that s it 
violence 
i hate your violence 
men 
anais  don t go 
i love you 
you re cruel and clever 
you re both cruel and clever 
i m afraid of both of you 
oh  god 
i m the wrong woman for you  henry 
i m the wrong woman for you  anais 
leave me alone 
don t touch me 
i m so terribly sick 
give me peace 
i love you 
get some sleep  anais 
i don t know why i keep thinking of
this little chinese restaurant   
henry and i used to go to
after i got off work 
he d wait for me outside the dance hall
at 2 00 in the morning 
and we d rush through
the freezing cold   
holding each other tight 
we d get there
just before closing time 
sit in the booth by the window
eating chow mein   
watching the snow swirl by 
there was some kind of unbelievable
thrill in the air between us 
i feel kind of honored by it now 
chin lee s 
it s funny 
it seems like a dream 
your eyes make me shy 
don t be shy 
you re so lovely 
so small 
i burnt myself out 
june  i worship you 
i don t want worship 
i want understanding 
i understand you 
we should go away somewhere together   
where there s lots of snow 
how little you are 
so thin 
i could break you in two 
i feel innocent now 
let yourself go 
relax 
you re still holding back 
let me see your body 
it isn t beautiful enough 
beautiful june 
i heard a noise out there 
henry was listening 
no  once henry falls asleep 
nothing can wake him up 
yeah 
i m sorry 
  i lost my head  i was drunk 
  don t be sorry 
this new lover of yours
has really made you bloom 
  it s chilly 
  tell me more about him 
did you make curtains for him 
did you give him books to read 
did you give him a typewriter 
no  you don t understand 
i don t understand 
what don t i understand 
that i love you 
love 
you just want experience 
you re a writer 
you make love to whatever you need 
  you re just like henry 
  no  i m just like you 
i can see exactly what you re doing 
you re so slippery 
so slippery 
you bitch 
liar  trickster 
you bought his love 
shut up 
you both robbed me blind 
you stole everything 
  what do i care  i ve got more to give 
  shut up 
to someone new 
some truly great writer 
henry said you just took us in
because you were bored 
that s a lie 
a lie 
i was dreaming about you 
anais 
what s wrong 
she lies 
she lies 
what is she afraid of 
i don t understand 
i tried to give her everything 
i know 
very pretty 
just like i figured it 
now i know everything 
i wanted to return something
before i leave 
some books i borrowed 
june  you re wrong 
we re just friends 
i never touched her 
get rid of her  henry 
all right  you made your choice 
i ve only got one more thing
i can give you 
your last chapter 
watch closely 
what are you doing out here 
it s freezing 
i thought she d do something crazy 
i never know 
i looked all over for her 
she s gone 
this is mine 
this is mine  too 
i feel like the war s over 
hey  what are you doing 
come on 
leave that there 
stay with me  for christ s sake 
we gotta talk 
i can t 
  where are you going 
  home 
what 
yeah 
hugo 
i love him  too 
you married a great guy 
fuck you  jack 
that won t do it 
that won t get rid of me 
you re my friend 
i m going to come after you 
hey  how can you leave me
at a time like this 
i need you 
i need you 
i thought you might need a lift 
is everything all right 
hey  henry 
give me your hand 
that morning i wept 
i wept because i loved the streets
that took me away from henry   
and would lead me back to him 
i wept because the process
by which i had become a woman   
was painful
