thatd take days
uh well uh
hub was always
too restless for texas
he convinced our folks
that he needed to go to europe
and i needed to come along
that was the summer of 1914
crowd chattering
ship horn blows
chuckles
woman speaking in french
boy
extra extra germany invades
garth unfortunately
just as we arrived in france
so did the kaiser
and the entire german army
i wanted to go home
but hub said
we should tour europe
one step ahead of the germans
and we did what a time that was
there were these girls
in toulon twins and they
coughs
anyway we eventually uh
wound up in marseilles
with passages booked
on the last ship out of europe
and hub he decided
that we should spend our last night
enjoying the local nightlife
band playing offenbachs
orpheus in the underworld
chattering
garth he made friends
with these soldiers
and they bought us some drinks
strong strange drinks
both shout
garth
we woke up on a ship
bound for north africa
shanghaied
men speaking in french
shanghaied
garth yeah
we found ourselves
in the french foreign legion
its all my fault hub said
but he told me not to worry
hed make sure
nothing happened to me
gunfire
and explosions booming
men grunting and shouting
garth we fought many battles
against overwhelming odds
he saved my life countless times
inaudible dialogue
garth when the war was over
we both went our separate ways
i ended up leading safaris mostly
for writers and uh hollywood folk
but that was too tame for hub
shouting
garth
he got commissions
from the new
north african governments
to put an end to the slave trade
no one slave trader or bedouin
had ever seen anything
like this mad american
who fought like 20 men
hub

about you and uncle hub
and jasmine
why would a smart kid like you
wanna hear hokey old stories
what else do we have to do
where was i
no one slave trader or bedouin
had ever seen anything
like this mad american
who fought like 20 men
yeah right right right
well it so happened
one of the women that hub freed
was handmaiden to a princess
when she told her mistress
the story of her rescue
most of all she told her about
the handsome heroic american
i must meet this man
the princess said
women giggling
garth one day hub was riding
his horse along the mediterranean
when out of nowhere
another rider came up alongside
but you know hub he wasnt
about to let a chance pass
it became a race
most people say that hub
was the best rider in north africa
but this other rider
kept neck and neck
as the race went on and on
then the two horses collided
the riders went flying into the sea
hub leaped to his feet
ready for anything
or so he thought
this was the princess
the most beautiful woman
he had ever seen
walter jasmine
garth jasmine
many people say theres
no such thing nowadays
its something
you only find in stories
but when these two set eyes
on each other for the first time
this was honest to god
no kidding sure enough
once in a lifetime
love at first sight
wait a minute if it was true love
they wouldve been married
and lived happily ever after right
arent you getting
ahead of the story
okay keep going
well
things werent easy for them
back then
she was promised
to another man
a powerful sheik
in a neighboring kingdom
he heard that jasmine
was in love with another
so he threatened her father
and took jasmine off
to his kingdom
and locked her up in his harem
she told the other wives
that she would rather die
than marry this heartless sheik
she had a knife on her
women gasp
garth and when
he came for her that night
she was going
to slit her own throat
what did uncle hub do
grunting and shouting
both whimpering
garth they got married
and lived happily ever after
the end
but wait
if they lived happily ever after
then they got married and shed
be here right now with us right

jasmine roaring

what about you you happy
hub speaking indistinctly
walter whats he saying to them
hes giving them his
what every boy needs to know
about being a man speech
a lot of men have heard
that speech over the years
a lot of men
will he give that speech to me
garth oh i guarantee it
assuming hes still around
of course
hey you didnt finish that story
about uncle hub and jasmine
you dont believe this africa stuff
its a good story
well after he rescued jasmine
several years passed
wonderful years
horses wh innying
garth
never were two people so happy
so in love
it was perfect
except for one thing
the sheik
the sheik
he hated hub
for stealing jasmine
so he put a price on hubs head
ten thousand pieces of gold
a fortune
assassins came from miles around
grunting and shouting
come on
garth he and jasmine
had to be on guard
every minute of every day
grunting and shouting
garth hub knew he and jasmine
couldnt run forever
that sooner or later
their luck would run out
there was only one thing to do
so one day an assassin led hub
bound in chains
into the sheiks fortress
to claim his 10000 pieces of gold
what
laugh ing
garth they gave the assassin
bags and bags of gold
as the sheik ordered hub
down to the notorious
dungeon of 1387 tortures
what kind of greedy nogood scum
would turn in uncle hub for money
well i would
hub grunting
walter
ah it was a trick
garth
yeah it was a trick
in the dungeon i drew my sword
grunting and shouting
and singlehandedly
slaughtered everyone in there
and freed hub without dropping
a single gold coin
walter
wait a minute wait a minute
you saved uncle hub
all this time carrying
hundreds of pounds of gold
you dont believe i killed
all those men and saved hub
well hub mightve helped
just a little
grunting and shouting
garth
we were greatly outnumbered
man screams
garth
we fought against incredible odds
and when it was over we split up
each one knew
what the other had to do
coins jingling
garth
high in his opulent bedchamber
the sheik slept
he awoke with hubs sword
across his throat
the sheik was terrified
but hub just lowered his blade
defend yourself hub cried
and he threw the sheik a sword
laugh ing
grunting and shouting
laugh ing
garth the sheik knew
that he would surely die now
without even the right
to beg for mercy
whimpering
garth
but hub just said
twice i have held
your life in my hands
and twice i have
given it back to you
the next time
your life is mine
horse whinnies
garth
and from that moment on
the assassination attempts
stopped
some say it was
because the sheik
was afraid that hub
would return and kill him
others said because hub
had spared his life
the sheik did the honorable thing
and let his enemy live
personally i think its because
the sheik was so damn busy once
they discovered oil in his kingdom
he became one of
the five richest men in the world
what the bad guy gets filthy rich
laugh ing
what the heck kind of story
ends that way
i just told it the way it happened
frankie bye
man 1 so long
so thats how you got
all your money
the gold from the sheik
well

maybe its just a new hobby
maybe he doesnt really mean to
you know do something crazy
you think so
you ask him yet
about jasmine
youd better make it quick
shouts

always one more war to fight
then i got old and came here
here i am
here i am
you cold son
youd better here
youd better

good boy thank you good boy
those stories about africa
about you
theyre true arent they
doesnt matter
it does too
around my mom all i hear is lies
i dont know what to believe in
if you wanna believe in something
then believe in it
just because something isnt true
thats no reason you cant believe in it
all right
theres a long speech
i give to young men
sounds like you need
to hear a piece of it
just a piece
sometimes the things
that may or may not be true
are the things that a man needs
to believe in the most
that people are basically good
that honor
courage and virtue
mean everything
that power and money
money and power mean nothing
that good always triumphs
over evil
and i want you to remember this
that love
true love never dies
you remember that boy
you remember that
doesnt matter if its true or not
you see
a man should believe
in those things because
those are the things
worth believing in
got that
that was a good speech
think so thanks
yeah
when are you gonna give me
the rest of the speech
when youre almost a man
you promise
wait one minute here wait
i cant be a good man until you
give me the rest of the speech right
you need to stick around until im
old enough to hear the whole thing
i see what youre trying to pull
you have to stick around
until im old enough
ill write it down
no i want you
to give me the speech
you wont be living here then
youre my uncle i need you
to stick around and be my uncle
what about uncle garth
he needs you
what about the dogs
and the pig
and the lion
we all need you i need you
no youre just being silly

walter sobbing
but if you go
