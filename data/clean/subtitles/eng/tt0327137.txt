such as yourselves

what are you doing
out here so late 
walter 
what s wrong with him 
well  a man s body may grow old   
   but inside his spirit can still be
as young and restless as ever 
and him   
   in his day  he had more spirit   
   than 20 men 
walter  it looks like
he s looking for something 
garth  mm hm 
 what 
he s looking for her 
who  what was her name 
jasmine 
okay  tell me 
you want me to tell you the story 
now 
that d take days 
uh  well  uh    
hub was always
too restless for texas 
he convinced our folks   
   that he needed to go to europe   
   and i needed to come along 
that was the summer of 1914 
 crowd chattering 
 ship horn blows 
 chuckles 
 woman speaking in french 
boy 
extra  extra  germany invades 
garth  unfortunately 
just as we arrived in france   
   so did the kaiser
and the entire german army 
i wanted to go home   
   but hub said
we should tour europe   
   one step ahead of the germans 
and we did  what a time that was 
there were these girls
in toulon  twins  and they    
 coughs 
anyway  we eventually  uh 
wound up in marseilles   
   with passages booked
on the last ship out of europe 
and hub  he decided
that we should spend our last night   
   enjoying the local nightlife 
 band playing offenbach s
 orpheus in the underworld  
 chattering 
garth  he made friends
with these soldiers   
   and they bought us some drinks 
strong  strange drinks 
 both shout 
garth 
we woke up on a ship   
   bound for north africa 
shanghaied 
 men speaking in french 
 shanghaied 
garth  yeah 
we found ourselves
in the french foreign legion 
 it s all my fault   hub said 
but he told me not to worry 
he d make sure
nothing happened to me 
 gunfire
and explosions booming 
 men grunting and shouting 
garth  we fought many battles
against overwhelming odds 
he saved my life countless times 
 inaudible dialogue 
garth  when the war was over 
we both went our separate ways 
i ended up leading safaris  mostly
for writers and  uh  hollywood folk 
but that was too tame for hub 
 shouting 
garth 
he got commissions   
   from the new
north african governments   
   to put an end to the slave trade 
no one  slave trader or bedouin   
   had ever seen anything
like this mad american   
   who fought like 20 men 
hub 
hey

out here in the middle of the night 
just enjoying the cool night air

that they stole from al capone 
 mouths 
be careful 
tell me more about africa 
about you and uncle hub
and jasmine 
why would a smart kid like you
wanna hear hokey old stories 
what else do we have to do 
where was i 
 no one  slave trader or bedouin   
   had ever seen anything
like this mad american   
   who fought like 20 men  
yeah  right  right  right 
well  it so happened   
   one of the women that hub freed   
   was handmaiden to a princess 
when she told her mistress
the story of her rescue   
   most of all  she told her about
the handsome  heroic american 
 i must meet this man  
the princess said 
 women giggling 
garth  one day  hub was riding
his horse along the mediterranean   
   when out of nowhere 
another rider came up alongside 
but you know hub  he wasn t
about to let a chance pass 
it became a race 
most people say that hub
was the best rider in north africa 
but this other rider
kept neck and neck   
   as the race went on and on 
then the two horses collided 
the riders went flying into the sea 
hub leaped to his feet
ready for anything   
   or so he thought 
this was the princess   
   the most beautiful woman
he had ever seen 
walter  jasmine 
garth  jasmine 
many people say there s
no such thing nowadays   
   it s something
you only find in stories   
   but when these two set eyes
on each other for the first time   
   this was honest to god 
no kidding  sure enough   
   once in a lifetime   
   love at first sight 
wait a minute  if it was true love   
   they would ve been married
and lived happily ever after  right 
aren t you getting
ahead of the story 
 okay  keep going 
 well   
   things weren t easy for them
back then 
she was promised
to another man   
   a powerful sheik
in a neighboring kingdom 
he heard that jasmine
was in love with another   
   so he threatened her father   
   and took jasmine off
to his kingdom   
   and locked her up in his harem 
she told the other wives
that she would rather die   
   than marry this heartless sheik 
she had a knife on her 
 women gasp 
garth  and when
he came for her that night   
   she was going
to slit her own throat 
what did uncle hub do 
 grunting and shouting 
 both whimpering 
garth  they got married 
and lived happily ever after 
the end 
but wait   
   if they lived happily ever after   
   then they got married  and she d
be here right now with us  right 
didn t they have kids 
where are they 
nurse  what s going on

 jasmine roars 
she won t come out of the cornfield 
this cornfield s the closest thing
to a jungle she s ever seen 
she knows this is where
she belongs 
 jasmine roaring 
 i think she s happy 
hub  i think she is 
what about you  you happy 
 hub speaking indistinctly 
walter  what s he saying to them 
 he s giving them his   
    what every boy needs to know
about being a man  speech 
a lot of men have heard
that speech over the years 
a lot of men 
 will he give that speech to me 
garth  oh  i guarantee it 
assuming he s still around 
of course 
hey  you didn t finish that story
about uncle hub and jasmine 
 you don t believe this africa stuff 
 it s a good story 
well  after he rescued jasmine   
   several years passed 
wonderful years 
 horses wh innying 
garth 
never were two people so happy   
   so in love 
it was perfect 
except for one thing 
 the sheik 
 the sheik 
he hated hub
for stealing jasmine   
   so he put a price on hub s head 
ten thousand pieces of gold 
a fortune 
assassins came from miles around 
 grunting and shouting 
come on 
garth  he and jasmine
had to be on guard   
   every minute of every day 
 grunting and shouting 
garth  hub knew he and jasmine
couldn t run forever   
   that sooner or later
their luck would run out 
there was only one thing to do 
so one day an assassin led hub 
bound in chains   
   into the sheik s fortress   
   to claim his 10 000 pieces of gold 
what 
 laugh ing 
garth  they gave the assassin
bags and bags of gold   
   as the sheik ordered hub   
   down to the notorious
dungeon of 1387 tortures 
what kind of greedy  no good scum
would turn in uncle hub for money 
well  i would 
 hub grunting 
walter 
ah  it was a trick 
garth 
yeah  it was a trick 
in the dungeon  i drew my sword   
 grunting and shouting 
   and single handedly
slaughtered everyone in there   
   and freed hub without dropping
a single gold coin 
walter 
wait a minute  wait a minute 
you saved uncle hub   
   all this time carrying
hundreds of pounds of gold 
you don t believe i killed
all those men and saved hub 
well  hub might ve helped
just a little 
 grunting and shouting 
garth 
we were greatly outnumbered 
 man screams 
garth 
we fought against incredible odds 
and when it was over  we split up 
each one knew
what the other had to do 
 coins jingling 
garth 
high in his opulent bedchamber   
   the sheik slept 
he awoke with hub s sword
across his throat 
the sheik was terrified   
   but hub just lowered his blade 
 defend yourself   hub cried 
and he threw the sheik a sword 
 laugh ing 
 grunting and shouting 
 laugh ing 
garth  the sheik knew
that he would surely die now   
   without even the right
to beg for mercy 
 whimpering 
garth 
but hub just said 
 twice i have held
your life in my hands   
   and twice i have
given it back to you 
the next time    
your life is mine 
 horse whinnies 
garth 
and from that moment on   
   the assassination attempts
stopped 
some say it was
because the sheik   
   was afraid that hub
would return and kill him 
others said because hub
had spared his life   
   the sheik did the honorable thing
and let his enemy live 
personally  i think it s because   
   the sheik was so damn busy once
they discovered oil in his kingdom 
he became one of
the five richest men in the world 
what  the bad guy gets filthy rich 
 laugh ing 
what the heck kind of story
ends that way 
i just told it the way it happened 
frankie  bye 
man 1  so long 
so that s how you got
all your money 
 the gold from the sheik 
 well    
yeah

will be okay now

i feel old and worn out  mm 
 you ve been busy

whoo  damn 
 dog barking 
 metal clanging 
walter

   you know  do something crazy 
you think so

about jasmine 
you d better make it quick 
 shouts 
what the hell 
it s the middle of the night 
what s the matter

here i am 
here i am 
you cold  son 
you d better   here

good boy  thank you  good boy 
those stories about africa   
   about you   
   they re true  aren t they 
 doesn t matter 
 it does too 
around my mom  all i hear is lies 
i don t know what to believe in 
if you wanna believe in something 
then believe in it 
just because something isn t true 
that s no reason you can t believe in it 
all right 
there s a long speech
i give to young men   
   sounds like you need
to hear a piece of it 
just a piece 
sometimes the things
that may or may not be true   
   are the things that a man needs
to believe in the most 
that people are basically good 
that honor   
   courage and virtue
mean everything 
that power and money 
money and power mean nothing 
that good always triumphs
over evil 
and i want you to remember this 
that love    
true love never dies 
you remember that  boy 
you remember that 
doesn t matter if it s true or not 
you see   
   a man should believe
in those things  because   
   those are the things
worth believing in 
got that 
that was a good speech 
think so  thanks 
yeah    
when are you gonna give me
the rest of the speech 
when you re almost a man 
 you promise 
 wait one minute here  wait  
i can t be a good man until you
give me the rest of the speech  right 
you need to stick around until i m
old enough to hear the whole thing 
 i see what you re trying to pull 
 you have to stick around   
    until i m old enough 
 i ll write it down 
no  i want you
to give me the speech 
you won t be living here then 
you re my uncle  i need you
to stick around and be my uncle 
what about uncle garth 
he needs you 
what about the dogs
and the pig   
   and the lion
