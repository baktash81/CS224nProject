i appreciate the efforts you making
in our little part of the world
but why are we talking here
we had set up
a low visibility prostitution sting
here last night
the sheriffs office never mentioned
anything to me
its not a perfect science
well obviously not all right
because i got a 20yearold girl
with her skull cracked in six places
this target last night he have a name
okay no no this has gone
far enough all right
protocol dictates that my lieutenant
talks to yall superior okay

thursday night outside the oasis

rock music plays in background

hey
what can i get you man
ill have what shes having thanks
first time the fbi voluntarily showed up
around this stretch huh
doesnt seem to be a shortage
in crime does there
well i appreciate you reaching out
im gonna give you some background
couple years ago
i got assigned two jane doe cases
both drugfriendly truck stop prostitutes
both dumped off the i10
both strangled assaulted bitten
and bodies suggestively staged
in view from the highway
now nobody wanted to touch it
just an impossible to get around
and then another body turned up
camera shutter clicking
and then another
until we had six
and a bona fide serial killer
who worked that for the bureau
a whipsmart analyst
with the state bureau built the profile
fbi gave it to a behavioral specialist
to confirm what we knew
white male truck driver mid30s
but nothing groundbreaking
some people they just think that
the girls the hookers and the druggies
they got what they had coming
what do you believe
hard luck in life dont make you
any less of a human
everybody needs a chance
to get back on their feet
few days ago a body was discovered
up by the state line
same mo to a t and then
last night at the motel
it was still him
but it was just rushed improvised
why the break in routine
honestly
i kinda think he was looking for you
but my question is why
i started communicating a few weeks ago
through an online ad
decided to meet up
at a motel in loxley
some locals jumped prematurely
started making arrests
i didnt blow my cover
after a little more eflirting
we decided to meet up
at the oasis a few nights ago
and some lowlevel pimp
spooked him off
stayed on me though
beeping
we were supposed to meet
at the mustang last night
byron hell be long gone by now
rebecca i can set him up again
its too dangerous
thatll never get authorization
you just said that you think
hes looking for me
hes gonna wanna try again
do you think that girl that disappeared
from the oasis is still alive
i dont know maybe
rebecca okay then
who reported her missing
byron i got a call from her sister
heather wallace
heather

last couple of days have stirred up
some shit for me though
ill be honest
when um clears throat
when i was a freshman
i got myself into a bad situation
and ill spare you all the gory details
but basically it involved
an upperclassman
too much booze
and some internal bleeding
my best friend got worried
and she told her mom
and her mom told my dad
and then it became a family issue
he was a cop right
mmhmm
he went after that kid
and his whole family
he lost his job
and uh thats when my parents
got divorced
i had no idea
well maybe if you ask somebody
about their life every once in a while
youd know that shit
laughs
fair enough
he and i actually started taking
taekwondo classes together after school
winning tournaments gave me something
to talk to him about
something to share and
it uh gave me a way to make him happy
i think you should leave too
we are leaving

what if a driver calls in sick
the load just doesnt sit right
of course not
another driver picks it up
or we have a temp driver
but it would show up on that list
yeah or they wouldnt get paid
you know but sometimes supervisors
if theyve previously been drivers before
theyll step in and run the load
but they would show up on that log
no managers are salaried so they dont
have to submit a timesheet log
gasps well how do you like that
what
one of our drivers has been out
on medical leave
a temp has run their load for the past
two weeks but not thursday
a manager signed for the load
who
