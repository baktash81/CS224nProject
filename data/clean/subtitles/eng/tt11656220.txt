potentially trafficked girls 
well  listen 
i appreciate the efforts you making
in our little part of the world 
  but why are we talking here 
  we had set up
a low visibility prostitution sting
here last night 
the sheriff s office never mentioned

it s not a perfect science 
well  obviously not  all right 
because i got a 20 year old girl
with her skull cracked in six places 
this target last night  he have a name 
okay  no  no  this has gone
far enough  all right 
protocol dictates that my lieutenant
talks to y all superior  okay

hi  my name is byron crawford 
and i m an agent with the fdle 
you said this target had no show

a young woman reported
that her 16 year old sister went missing 
thursday night outside the oasis 
i d love to hear anything else
you got on this guy

and i ll sit in the car
and eat fucking burritos all night 
 karl  i didn t think too much of it 
and then that assault came in

 rock music plays in background 
  hello 
  hey 
  what can i get you  man 
  i ll have what she s having  thanks 
first time the fbi voluntarily showed up
around this stretch  huh 
doesn t seem to be a shortage
in crime  does there 
well  i appreciate you reaching out 
i m gonna give you some background 
couple years ago 
i got assigned two jane doe cases 
both drug friendly truck stop prostitutes 
both dumped off the i 10 
both strangled  assaulted  bitten 
and bodies suggestively staged
in view from the highway 
now  nobody wanted to touch it 
just an impossible to get around 
and then another body turned up 
   camera shutter clicking 
  and then another 
until we had six 
and a bona fide serial killer 
who worked that for the bureau 
a whip smart analyst
with the state bureau built the profile 
fbi gave it to a behavioral specialist
to confirm what we knew 
white  male  truck driver  mid 30s 
but nothing groundbreaking 
some people  they just think that   
the girls  the hookers and the druggies 
they got what they had coming 
what do you believe 
hard luck in life don t make you
any less of a human 
everybody needs a chance
to get back on their feet 
few days ago  a body was discovered
up by the state line 
same m o  to a t  and then
last night at the motel 
it was still him 
but it was just rushed  improvised 
  why the break in routine 
  honestly   
i kinda think he was looking for you 
but my question is    why 
i started communicating a few weeks ago
through an online ad 
decided to meet up
at a motel in loxley 
some locals jumped prematurely 
started making arrests 
i didn t blow my cover 
after a little more    e flirting 
we decided to meet up
at the oasis a few nights ago 
and some low level pimp
spooked him off 
  stayed on me  though 
   beeping 
we were supposed to meet
at the mustang last night 
   byron  he ll be long gone by now 
   rebecca  i can set him up again 
it s too dangerous 
that ll never get authorization 
you just said that you think
he s looking for me 
he s gonna wanna try again 
do you think that girl that disappeared
from the oasis is still alive 
i don t know  maybe 
 rebecca  okay then 
who reported her missing 
 byron  i got a call from her sister 
heather wallace 
  heather 
  hmm 
i m the one that called 
 music plays on radio 
are you a cop 
just here to help 
  you brought her here 
  i didn t have a choice 
i borrowed some money
from people that i thought was my friends 
and boom  next thing you know  i m here 
and i was told i had
to pay it off  you know 
it s not totally bad all the time 
but it s not for no 16 year old 
that s what i told him 
said she s off limits 
that shit didn t last long 
 lighter flicks 
  who 
  the skinny fuck who runs this place 
calvin 
thursday the last night
that you saw your sister 
yeah  calvin got his girls
fucked up on something nasty
and had all these guys come over 
said it was a group thing 
all i remember is telling tracey
to get the fuck out of here 
 heather  tracey  get out of here 
so she left  and never come back 
where does calvin stay 
the room at the far end 
since the accident 
got busted up in a car crash 
it s kind of funny 
ha 
will you find her for me 
yeah  i m just gonna go
have a chat with calvin 
 gasps 
 sobbing 
 stammering  you said   
that if i m quiet 
and if i m good  that you d let me go 
   sobbing 
  you ve been a good girl 
yeah  you been a good girl now 
oh  sweetheart

   sobbing  i heard her voice 
  hey

 grunting 
i know  i know 
 panting  don t talk about my daughter 
she was sent to this earth
to absolve me of my sins
and bless me with a greater understanding
of eternal  holy love

  a white truck driver 
  who does he drive for 
  how the fuck should i know

he tried to cuff one of my girls 
that s it

my daddy never beat my mom  all right 
what 
you said i used to watch my daddy

some shit for me  though 
i ll be honest 
when  um     clears throat 
when i was a freshman 
i got myself into a bad situation 
and i ll spare you all the gory details 
but basically it involved
an upperclassman 
too much booze 
and some internal bleeding 
my best friend got worried
and she told her mom 
and her mom told my dad
and then it became a family issue 
  he was a cop  right 
  mm hmm 
he went after that kid
and his whole family 
he lost his job 
and  uh    that s when my parents
got divorced 
i had no idea 
well  maybe if you ask somebody
about their life every once in a while 
  you d know that shit 
   laughs 
fair enough 
he and i actually started taking
taekwondo classes together after school 
winning tournaments gave me something
to talk to him about 
something to share and   
it  uh  gave me a way to make him happy 
  i think you should leave too 
  we are leaving

i know this shit bothers you 
oh  you do  you listened to my sad story

i like having the opportunity
to blast these motherfuckers

what if a driver calls in sick 
  the load just doesn t sit  right 
  of course not 
another driver picks it up

  yeah  or they wouldn t get paid 
you know  but sometimes  supervisors 
if they ve previously been drivers before 
they ll step in and run the load 
but they would show up on that log 
no  managers are salaried  so they don t
have to submit a timesheet log 
 gasps  well  how do you like that

one of our drivers has been out
on medical leave 
a temp has run their load for the past
two weeks  but not thursday
