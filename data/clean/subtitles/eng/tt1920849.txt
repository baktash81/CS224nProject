oh  chinatown 
i need a limo to jfk

and i need um  champagne
sent up to my suite 
wait 
no 
plans have changed  okay 
the bride wants a
bachelorette party now 
oh  okay   well  why
am i the last to know 
i can t believe you
get paid for this 
and i m just a good friend 
 gena 
about blowjobs 
if you want to hear it 
yeah 
yeah  sure 
yeah 
it s very interesting 
all right 
i i personally think
that blowjobs are
an extremely delicate thing 
you know  like if you re  
if you re ranking them
on a scale of 1 to 10 
1 being i m blowing it kisses
and 10 being i m  you know 
choking on just semen 
vomit just everywhere 
i think you gotta start
off with 4s and with 5s 
like just enough so the   
so that you know that
i know exactly what i m doing 
but with zero enthusiasm 
i m giving you nothing 
because then you re
gonna be like
all right  fine  i ll
just fuck her  you know 
 cause if i start off with
a 10  i got nowhere to go 
i mean  why are you gonna
spend any time fucking me 
you just came all over my face 
so you start off small  right 
but you build 
i ll give you a 6
after a fight  when
we re making up 
and then an 8
when you spend a
shitload of money on me 
or get me something
that s like a sweet   
gift or whatever 
i ll do full 8 
but then  i circle it back 
back to the 3s  the 4s  and
the 5s  because that shit 
every time  without fail 
makes the guy s
dick alarm go off 
you know what i mean
when i say dick alarm 
right 
and you re gonna be like 
 hey  baby 
what s wrong with you 
you re acting funny 
why so sad  
when really what you re
telling me is   god dammit 
just like suck
my dick harder  
so    um    let s just
say um  like  what   
what would merit a 10 
what s an example 
i don t know 
you re like on a   
on an airplane  you re going
to a wedding of this girl
that you went to
high school with 
uh  two more 
 stewardess  sure 
and your ex boyfriend uh   
 laugh 
your ex boyfriend who
ruined your fucking life
is gonna be there 
that jerk 
all this pent up
frustration 
sitting next to some dude
you re never gonna see again 
that would warrant a 10 
 clears throat  well

that s so sweet 
i always ask them
their stories  too 
 cause you never know
like where they    oh 
she s gonna be so happy 
her son s gonna
have the gift of sight 
why don t you ask her
to smoke pot with you 
why is that
actually a good idea 
is that cool to do 
please  i need a
break from  that  
we re not calling her  that  
we re trying
not to call her  that  
i called her  that  earlier 
 joe 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
your security guy s  the security s   
thank you 
that was amazing  but
i m a little bored now 
hey  is there
anything you can do
to help joe score with katie 
no 
why 
i m a completely
powerless figurehead 
i m like truman at geneva 
you mean truman at potsdam 
i think i know what
i m talking about 
truman inherited the presidency
because roosevelt died 
poor fuck got sworn in 
flown to potsdam to deal
with stalin and churchill 
figure out what the fuck to do
with post war germany
and all of europe 
geneva conference is
completely different thing 
so i think you meant
truman at potsdam 
oh  i switched it   cause
i m a little drunk 
it wouldn t have
made sense anyway 
because truman had the trump
card  he had the bomb 
so really  he was in
control the whole time 
oh  do you believe in magic 
yes  i do 
that s    abso  yes 
do you believe in
a magic vagina 
a magic vagina 
it would bewitch
you with its magic 
i ve been bewitched
by vaginas before 
it s scary  actually 
i think i might be stupid 
why would you say
that about yourself 
i don t understand anything
anyone is talking about 
most of the time 
that has nothing
to do with intelligence 
it s like this   
there s lots of different
kinds of smart 
you know  and you just
have to discover
which smart you are 
see  i i don t understand
what you just said 
that s okay  neither do i 
be honest  would you
marry a stripper 
um    shh    shh   
shh    shh   
there s no touching allowed 
okay 
did you know that 
i    did  hadn t really   
we re not allowed to touch 
okay  well  i m not   
i mean  my hands
are down  i m not   
mm mm    but if you
wanted to  you could 
i m confused  it s not
allowed  but i can 
if you wanted to
touch me  you could 
i m gonna give it a shot  okay 
okay 
just    all right 
mm hmm 
that s  200 
that s  200 
mm hmm 
that s  200 
two zero zero 
okay  well  i i mean  i
feel like that s a   
that s a a pretty good   
deal   
oh  genny 
 stripper  these guys suck 
hand full of splooge 
been there 
is it your first night 
no    but pretty rad
that you think i m
hot enough to work here 
you okay 
no  because   
my stupid ex boyfriend s
in the back right now 
getting humped by some skank 
no offense 
we are skanks 
it s so dumb 
like honestly 
i don t even know why i m
freaking out about it 
i should be fixing the dress 
not obsessing over him 
look  the only reason why romeo
is back there is because
he knows he s not
getting laid tonight 
it s true 
yeah  i mean  if he thought
he had a chance with you 
he would be all over your ass 
like a fat kid eating cake 
thanks 
yeah  men are all
sorts of fucked 
they feel insecure
for one second
and they need
to go feel powerful
for a couple of hours 
women feel shitty
about themselves
and they just go
cry in the bathroom 
yeah 
or they stab each
other in the back 
yeah  i guess
there s that  too 
yeah 
oh  that s good 
yeah 
i should like 
do this more often 
come to these
bathrooms  you know 
so much cheaper than going
to a fucking therapist 
yeah 
all right 
that s great  thank you 
regan 
 trevor  whoa  we re still having   
what is that
