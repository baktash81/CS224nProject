plans have changed okay
the bride wants a
bachelorette party now
oh okaywell why
am i the last to know
i cant believe you
get paid for this
and im just a good friend
gena
about blowjobs
if you want to hear it
yeah
yeah sure
yeah
its very interesting
all right
ii personally think
that blowjobs are
an extremely delicate thing
you know like if youre
if youre ranking them
on a scale of 1 to 10
1 being im blowing it kisses
and 10 being im you know
choking on just semen
vomit just everywhere
i think you gotta start
off with 4s and with 5s
like just enough so the
so that you know that
i know exactly what im doing
but with zero enthusiasm
im giving you nothing
because then youre
gonna be like
all right fine ill
just fuck her you know
cause if i start off with
a 10 i got nowhere to go
i mean why are you gonna
spend any time fucking me
you just came all over my face
so you start off small right
but you build
ill give you a 6
after a fight when
were making up
and then an 8
when you spend a
shitload of money on me
or get me something
thats like a sweet
gift or whatever
ill do full 8
but then i circle it back
back to the 3s the 4s and
the 5s because that shit
every time without fail
makes the guys
dick alarm go off
you know what i mean
when i say dick alarm
right
and youre gonna be like
hey baby
whats wrong with you
youre acting funny
why so sad
when really what youre
telling me is god dammit
just like suck
my dick harder
so um lets just
say um like what
what would merit a 10
whats an example
i dont know
youre like on a
on an airplane youre going
to a wedding of this girl
that you went to
high school with
uh two more
stewardess sure
and your exboyfriend uh
laugh
your exboyfriend who
ruined your fucking life
is gonna be there
that jerk
all this pentup
frustration
sitting next to some dude

why dont you ask her
to smoke pot with you
why is that
actually a good idea

break from that
were not calling her that
were trying
not to call her that
i called her that earlier
joe
im sorry im sorry
your security guys the securitys
thank you
that was amazing but
im a little bored now
hey is there
anything you can do
to help joe score with katie
no
why
im a completely
powerless figurehead
im like truman at geneva
you mean truman at potsdam
i think i know what
im talking about
truman inherited the presidency
because roosevelt died
poor fuck got sworn in
flown to potsdam to deal
with stalin and churchill
figure out what the fuck to do
with postwar germany
and all of europe
geneva conference is
completely different thing
so i think you meant
truman at potsdam
oh i switched it cause
im a little drunk
it wouldnt have
made sense anyway
because truman had the trump
card he had the bomb
so really he was in
control the whole time
oh do you believe in magic
yes i do
thats abso yes
do you believe in
a magic vagina
a magic vagina
it would bewitch
you with its magic
ive been bewitched
by vaginas before
its scary actually
i think i might be stupid
why would you say
that about yourself
i dont understand anything
anyone is talking about
most of the time
that has nothing
to do with intelligence
its like this
theres lots of different
kinds of smart
you know and you just
have to discover
which smart you are
see ii dont understand
what you just said
thats okay neither do i
be honest would you
marry a stripper
um shh shh
shh shh
theres no touching allowed
okay
did you know that
i did hadnt really
were not allowed to touch
okay well im not
i mean my hands
are down im not
mmmm but if you
wanted to you could
im confused its not
allowed but i can
if you wanted to
touch me you could
im gonna give it a shot okay
okay
just all right
mmhmm
thats 200
thats 200
mmhmm
thats 200
twozerozero
okay well ii mean i
feel like thats a
thats aa pretty good
deal
oh genny
stripper these guys suck
hand full of splooge
been there
is it your first night
no but pretty rad
that you think im
hot enough to work here
you okay
no because
my stupid exboyfriends
in the back right now
getting humped by some skank
no offense
we are skanks
its so dumb
like honestly
i dont even know why im
freaking out about it
i should be fixing the dress
not obsessing over him
look the only reason why romeo
is back there is because
he knows hes not
getting laid tonight
its true
yeah i mean if he thought
he had a chance with you
he would be all over your ass
like a fat kid eating cake
thanks
yeah men are all
sorts of fucked
they feel insecure
for one second
and they need
to go feel powerful
for a couple of hours
women feel shitty
about themselves
and they just go
cry in the bathroom
yeah
or they stab each
other in the back
yeah i guess
theres that too
yeah
oh thats good
yeah
i should like
do this more often
come to these
bathrooms you know
so much cheaper than going
to a fucking therapist
yeah
all right
thats great thank you
