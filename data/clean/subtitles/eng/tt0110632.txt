after that  there was no stopping
mickey and mallory 
they tore up the countryside with
a vengeance right out of the bible 
tonight  i m standing on
highway 666 
running through towns like
cortez  shiprock  sheep springs   
   and ending in gallup  new mexico 
to some  a beautiful stretch
of the american landscape   
   but to mickey and mallory knox 
who are still at large 
it is a candy lane
of murder and mayhem 
patrolman gerald nash   
was just the first
of 12 peace officers   
that mickey and mallory murdered during
their reign of terror  a dramatization
gerald and his partner   
dale wrigley 
were parked at this donut shop 
alfie s donuts  when   
this 1970 dodge challenger
pulled up across the street
from the donut shop 
gerald  only three weeks
out of the academy 
come walkin  out with coffee   
   and my bear claw 
hey you 
driver asked him a question 
how the hell
do you get to farmington 
looked like he was
giving street directions 
head on out on 324 
take it over to 66
and farmington s up about 65 miles 
quick ride 
you folks goin  there 
when he finished
they waved him thanks   
then up come that shotgun 
you cop killin  cocksuckers 
in the ensuing chase
a tragic murder occurred 
american bronze medalist
marathon bicyclist   
brian smith   
i always wanted to
take a shot at one of  em 
they re not so easy to hit 
we raped and pillaged
the first show 
we changed the order so
it wouldn t be so obvious 
it needs a new intro
in my opinion 
who is this guy 
you can t cannibalize yourself
all the time 
  repetition works  davey 
  you re gonna wind up with shit 
do you think those nitwits
out there in zombie land
   remember anything 
this is junk food for the brains 
it s filler  fodder 
whatever 
look  just build
it to the interview  okay 
keep saying that word 
 live interview with wayne gale  
anticipation  davey 
that s what it s all about 
what do you think of
mickey and mallory  huh

thing to happen to mass murder

 love makes the world go  round  
i need to talk to you
about something   
how s a fella like you get to be
a specialist in psychos  anyway 
i d recommend
having your mother killed by one 
after that happened 
i developed an interest 
i spent the first part
of my life in texas 
you don t have an accent 
i don t wanna talk
like those assholes 
my mother was from texas 
the ones who beat
the shit out of me 
when i was eight
we went to play in the park 
the same day charles whitman
started shooting strangers
from the top of
the university of texas 
  and you was with her 
  sure was 
the thing is 
i didn t hear any of the shots 
one minute
i m with my mother   
and all of a sudden 
chest explodes 
she hits the ground 
her forearm flies off 
her hip explodes 
and i m not hearing
any of these shots 
boom 
chest explodes 
i spent all goddamned day
lying on the grass 
being eaten alive
by fuckin  ant s  thinking   
 what happened to my mom  
and since then
i ve had a strong opinion
about the psychopathic fringe
thriving in america s fast food culture 
i tend not to exhibit
the self discipline 
becoming of a police officer 
you got it right  jack 
you don t mind do you 
if i call you jack 
we got an army of
shrinks in here   
that talks about mania and
schizophrenia and multiphrenia   
   and obsessions 
it makes me sick 
it s all pride 
it s arrogance    it s bullshit 
mickey and mallory knox
are not the sickest
i ve ever seen 
tonight s movie will be
 escape from the planet of the apes  
so  why me  dwight

it s a time bomb 
fry the pricks 
every time we do
they kill somebody new 
and we gotta start
all over again

that s why we re sending them
for testing to nystrom with you 
lobotomy bay 
vegetable land 
home of the criminally insane 
  that hasn t been done in years 
  we got a stage one ruling 
it won t stick with these asshole
do good shrinks around 
but it ll get  em under your control
for a couple of hours 
then what 
you re a celebrated law man 
public loves you 
15 years on the force 
best seller out in paperback 
a modern day pat garrett with a
deadly axe to grind with maniacs 
that is why
you have been chosen
to delver mr  and mrs  knox

two pigfuckers   
if they happen to take
a little lead

you want this job

i have a television show 
and every couple of weeks we do 
it s our thing about
 current america  
we do a profile
on a different serial killer 
technically  mass murderer

well  it s pretty hard
to beat the king 
yeah  anyway 
julle  my producer and i   
we ve waited a long time
to do a follow up episode on you 
and that time has definitely come 
i feel it s apparent to anyone
who s hip to what s going on 
that these prison boys
have thrown the constitution   
   straight out the fucking window 
you and mallory may be killers 
but nuts  insane  
today they wipe clean your mind 
because they feel
your actions are dangerous 
tomorrow  they might
clean my mind   
or dump me into
fucking syndication 
because they feel
what i say is dangerous 
where does it all end  
now  i have interviews
with the prison board 
and the psychiatrist 
emil reingold

and go over every day 
every minute of our happiness 
i take it all as it comes

these guys want to tear
their wives  heads off

mickey and mallory

between right and wrong 
they just don t give a damn 
this will be the most talked about
event in television history 
   they were sexually abused
as children  dr  reingold 
i can t imagine

 american maniacs  
on w a t c h 
mickey knox is the most
dangerous man in america 
but wayne gale isn t afraid
to meet him  one on one 
to learn what 48 people died for 
is this man insane  or does he belong
where he sent so many others 
   in the grave 
mickey knox 
thank you for this time 
i ve got a few questions
to start with  if you don t mind 
ahem well  that s really
nice  wayne 
mickey knox  when did you
start thinking about killing 
birth  i was thrown into a flaming
pit of scum forgotten by god 
what do you mean by that 
i mean  i came from violence 
it was in my blood 
my dad had it 
his dad had it 
  it s just my fate 
  do you believe in fate  boy 
  my fate 
  no one is born evil  mickey   
it s something you learn 
what about your father 
how did he die 
you were only 10 years old 
and there s a lot of speculation   
i didn t kill my father 
and i don t wanna talk about that shit 
hey  hey    
watch it  watch it 
it s all right  it s okay   
it s okay 
go on to something else  okay 
please  let s do 
so  tell me  how can you look
at an ordinary person 
an innocent guy with kids 
and then  shoot him to death 
i mean  how can you
bring yourself to do that 
innocent  who s innocent 
wayne  you 
i m innocent  yes  i am 
of murder  definitely 
it s just murder  man 
all of god s creatures do it 
some form or another 
i mean  you look in the forest   
you got species
killing other species 
our is killin  all the species
including  the forest 
and we just call it
 industry   not murder 
but i know a lot of people
who deserve to die 
why do they deserve to die 
i think everybody got
something in their past 
some sin  some awful 
secret thing 
a lot of people walking around
out there  already dead 
just need to be
put out of their misery 
that s where i come in 
fate s messenger 
 except a corn of wheat
falleth to the ground and die 
it abideth alone  but if it die 
it bringeth forth much fruit  
oh  the theory that  everyone
meets a serial killer halfway  thing 
is that what you re saying 
the wolf don t know why he s a wolf 
the deer don t know why he s a deer 
god just made it that way 
you re saying the world itself
is predatory 
that when a mountain lion
takes down an elk 
it s because it s the
elk s time to go 
and all the b s  liberal agenda
about saving the animal herds   
only serves to overpopulate
the balance of nature 
maybe you re right  mickey 
i don t think so 
but maybe you re right 
corporate predators   
environmental predators 
nuclear predators 
life is a hunt 
i ve seen it  i was there 
when the
hit the fan at grenada 
i saw it all go down at grenada 
so tell me  mickey 
any regrets 
three weeks  50 people killed 
not too cool  mickey 
52  but i don t spend
a lot of time with regret 
that s a wasted emotion 
seriously  you must have
some regret  rack your brain 
well  i wish that indian
hadn t got killed 
bad  bad  bad
bad  bad 
one of your last victims 
man had a rattlesnake
sitting  in the corner 
a rattlesnake 
could pick it up  pet it 
he saw it 
he saw what 
the demon 
he saw the demon 
the demon 
what demon 
everybody got the demon
in here  okay 
the demon lives in here 
it feeds on your hate 
cuts  kills  rapes   
it uses your weakness  your fears 
only the vicious survive 
all right  you tell  em 
we re told we re no good pieces of shit
from the time we could breathe 
after a while 
you kind of become bad 
after the indian
we were gonna quit killin  
the old man
took it out of us 
  what happened 
  it was just a mistake  you know   
man was tryin  to help us 
you know  pet us 
same dream i ve had
since i was a kid  i guess 
i was just runnin  with the animals

every other animal in the forest 
death  just death
kinda becomes what you are 
after a while 
you begin to like it 
you know about realization 
i mean  all this  is just illusion 
mr  rabbit says 
 the moment of realization   
the moment of realization   
is worth   
a thousand prayers  
you re crazy  mate 
i don t think i m any crazier
than you are 
i m extremes  dark and light 
you know that 
i m light with mal

mallory s my salvation 
she was teaching me
how to love

being in the garden of eden

respected journalist 
hold that 
duncan duncan homolka 
wayne gale 
you wanted reality 
you got it 
my name is wayne gale 
i am the star of  american maniacs  
watched by 40 million
people a week 
i am a respected journalist 
winner of the murrow
and the golden globe award 
to name a few 
i have been shot 
you are on camera 
we are live  if anybody tries
to fuck up our escape 
i will make it my life s mission 
to put dwight mcclusky
out of commission 
i will do expose after expose 
revealing the inhumanity 
the brutality of the conditions
that exist here 
you  back up  back up 
my name is wayne gale  i am the star
of  american maniacs   
you re all on camera 
we are live 
just how far do you think
you re gonna get 
rlght out the front door 
that will never happen 
it is happening 
my name is wayne gale 
i am a friend of bill clinton s 
if anybody puts me in danger 
you open that gate 
my name is wayne gale  
i will personally hunt you down   
blow the head
off your fucking whore wife   
and plant your sick ass
into the ground all by myself 
another day  perhaps 
but not today 
this is wayne gale 
unfortunately no longer live 
i am wounded 
all my crew is dead 
i have left my wife 
and my girlfriend has left me 
look back up  that was good 
mickey knox s plan worked 
we walked out the front   
into my news van
and made our getaway 
when we were followed
by patrol cars 
mallory shot deputy sheriff
duncan homolka 
and tossed his body out the back 
show  em your ear 
aghh 
oh  my god 
that is so gross 
why helicopters were not deployed 
i don t know 
my only thought is  it all happened
too fast for arrangements to be made 
  wayne 
  we ve pulled up alongside the road   
to do this interview 
tensions run high as we 
we ain t got all fuckin  day 
so without any further ado 
mickey and mallory 
so  mallory  after mickey s incredible
rescue  what did you think next 
i was just wondering 
how long it would be   
until me and mickey
could be alone together 
and if i could wait that long 
so    did you have anything
to do with the riot 
we didn t have nothin  to do
with that riot 
that was   
whatchamacallem    
  faked 
  faked 
they wanna say we masterminded
the whole fuckin  thing 
let  em  it s not like
it s gonna keep us up at night 
but the truth is  it was   
fate 
ah  yes  faked it was 
and you saw it right here 
on  american maniacs  
you believe in reincarnation  wayne 
yes  i believe we ve all
lived many times 
so  what s next for the knoxes 
well  i m thinkin  we can lay
in a big king size bed 
and sleep for about two days 
and i ve been thinkin 
about motherhood 
so  i think me and mickey
are gonna get started on that 
as quickly as possible 
gotta go 
how do you two
intend to disappear 
you re probably the most
famous couple in america 
there is that underground railroad 
okay  end of the interview 
let me just
swing the camera around 
and do my wrap up 
and we re off 
oh  we re gonna do
a little wrap up all right  wayne 
but it won t be you in the camera 
lookin  dumb and actln  stupid 
instead  you re gonna be starin 
down the barrels of our shotguns 
and we re blowin  your brains
all over that tree back there 
wait  wait  time 
cut  cut  cut 
that s a fuckin  joke  right 
i thought during
this whole escape thing   
a bond had built between us 
no  not really 
you re scum  wayne 
you did it for ratings 
you don t give a shit about us 
or about anybody
except yourself 
that s why nobody
gave a shit about you 
that s why 
 helicopters were not deployed  
wait a minute  you fuckin  hypocrite 
what about the indian 
you said you were done with killing 
you said   love beats the demon  
you said that love beats the demon 
i am  and it will 
it s just that you re
the last one  wayne 
don t fuckin  kill me 
this is not about you 
you egomaniac  i kinda like you 
but if we let you go 
we d be just like everybody else 
killin  you 
and what you represent  is   
a statement 
i m not 100  sure
exactly what it s sayin  
but frankenstein
killed dr  frankenstein   
wayne    
have some dignity 
all right  so i m a parasite 
so what 
life is cruel  no one said
it was gonna be easy 
but don t you two kill 
you belong to us 
to the public 
to the media 
that s how it is 
and we are married  mate 
and the point is 
what do we do next 
i say  we do
a salman rushdie type thing 
books  talk shows   
we lay low  we jump up 
we bob and weave 
we do oprah 
we do donahue 
do you have any idea
how huge we could be 
let s make a little music  colorado 
wait  wait  wait 
don t mickey and mallory leave
somebody alive to tell the tale 
we are   
your camera
