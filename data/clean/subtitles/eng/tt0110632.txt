after that there was no stopping
mickey and mallory
they tore up the countryside with
a vengeance right out of the bible
tonight im standing on
highway 666
running through towns like
cortez shiprock sheep springs
and ending in gallup new mexico
to some a beautiful stretch
of the american landscape
but to mickey and mallory knox
who are still at large
it is a candy lane
of murder and mayhem
patrolman gerald nash
was just the first
of 12 peace officers
that mickey and mallory murdered during
their reign of terror a dramatization
gerald and his partner
dale wrigley
were parked at this donut shop
alfies donuts when
this 1970 dodge challenger
pulled up across the street
from the donut shop
gerald only three weeks
out of the academy
come walkin out with coffee
and my bear claw
hey you
driver asked him a question
how the hell
do you get to farmington
looked like he was
giving street directions
head on out on 324
take it over to 66
and farmingtons up about 65 miles
quick ride
you folks goin there
when he finished
they waved him thanks
then up come that shotgun
you cop killin cocksuckers
in the ensuing chase
a tragic murder occurred
american bronze medalist
marathon bicyclist
brian smith
i always wanted to
take a shot at one of em
theyre not so easy to hit
we raped and pillaged
the first show
we changed the order so
it wouldnt be so obvious
it needs a new intro
in my opinion
who is this guy
you cant cannibalize yourself
all the time
repetition works davey
youre gonna wind up with shit
do you think those nitwits
out there in zombie land
remember anything
this is junk food for the brains
its filler fodder
whatever
look just build
it to the interview okay

live interview with wayne gale
anticipation davey

what do you think of
mickey and mallory huh

mickey and mallory are the best
thing to happen to mass murder
since manson

mickey cest ihomme
jim morrison jack nicholson
add a bloody pail of nitrate

love makes the world go round
i need to talk to you
about something
hows a fella like you get to be
a specialist in psychos anyway
id recommend
having your mother killed by one
after that happened
i developed an interest
i spent the first part
of my life in texas
you dont have an accent
i dont wanna talk
like those assholes
my mother was from texas
the ones who beat
the shit out of me
when i was eight
we went to play in the park
the same day charles whitman
started shooting strangers
from the top of
the university of texas
and you was with her
sure was
the thing is
i didnt hear any of the shots
one minute
im with my mother
and all of a sudden
chest explodes
she hits the ground
her forearm flies off
her hip explodes
and im not hearing
any of these shots
boom
chest explodes
i spent all goddamned day
lying on the grass
being eaten alive
by fuckin ants thinking
what happened to my mom
and since then
ive had a strong opinion
about the psychopathic fringe
thriving in americas fast food culture
i tend not to exhibit
the self discipline
becoming of a police officer
you got it right jack
you dont mind do you
if i call you jack
we got an army of
shrinks in here
that talks about mania and
schizophrenia and multiphrenia
and obsessions
it makes me sick
its all pride
its arrogance its bullshit
mickey and mallory knox

every time we do
they kill somebody new
and we gotta start

you cant get rid of dwight
thats why were sending them
for testing to nystrom with you
lobotomy bay
vegetable land
home of the criminally insane

it wont stick with these asshole
dogood shrinks around
but itll get em under your control
for a couple of hours

that these prison boys
have thrown the constitution

you and mallory may be killers
but nuts insane
today they wipe clean your mind
because they feel
your actions are dangerous
tomorrow they might
clean my mind
or dump me into
fucking syndication
because they feel
what i say is dangerous

with the prison board
and the psychiatrist
emil reingold

i had no feelings
you were right
and you were wrong
i got more feelings now
than i ever had before
ive been reading a lot
and doing yoga with this guy
but he pissed me off
hes not around anymore
at night i pretend
youre lying next to me
i lie in my cell
i imagine kissing you
not making love
just kissing for hours
and hours on end
i remember everything
about our time
i remember every secret
you ever shared
i remember every single time
you laughed
and your dancing
oh my god your dancing
i lie on my bed
and go over every day
every minute of our happiness
i take it all as it comes
and i live that day again
that way when i get
to our first kiss
theyre not just memories
i feel that joy again
dr reingold are they insane
insane

psychotic yes
its right after the super bowl
weve got em in their homes
the game has just sucked
and they want to see this guy mickey
whats he like
a country numb with violence
these guys want to tear
their wives heads off
yeah but some of them
mickey and mallory
know the difference
between right and wrong
they just dont give a damn
this will be the most talked about
event in television history
they were sexually abused
as children dr reingold
i cant imagine
i dont think that its
i would say no
when you suggested that i marry
your daughter after i got her pregnant
thats exactly what i did
now you listen to me

their subsequent trial

pathetic circus

american maniacs
on watch
mickey knox is the most
dangerous man in america
but wayne gale isnt afraid
to meet him one on one
to learn what 48 people died for
is this man insane or does he belong
where he sent so many others
in the grave
mickey knox
thank you for this time
ive got a few questions
to start with if you dont mind
ahemwell thats really
nice wayne
mickey knox when did you
start thinking about killing
birth i was thrown into a flaming
pit of scum forgotten by god
what do you mean by that
i mean i came from violence
it was in my blood
my dad had it
his dad had it
its just my fate
do you believe in fate boy
my fate
no one is born evil mickey
its something you learn
what about your father
how did he die
you were only 10 years old
and theres a lot of speculation
i didnt kill my father
and i dont wanna talk about that shit
hey hey
watch it watch it
its all right its okay
its okay
go on to something else okay
please lets do
so tell me how can you look
at an ordinary person
an innocent guy with kids
and then shoot him to death
i mean how can you
bring yourself to do that
innocent whos innocent
wayne you
im innocent yes i am
of murder definitely
its just murder man
all of gods creatures do it
some form or another
i mean you look in the forest
you got species
killing other species
our is killin all the species
including the forest
and we just call it
industry not murder
but i know a lot of people
who deserve to die
why do they deserve to die
i think everybody got
something in their past
some sin some awful
secret thing
a lot of people walking around
out there already dead
just need to be
put out of their misery
thats where i come in
fates messenger
except a corn of wheat
falleth to the ground and die
it abideth alone but if it die
it bringeth forth much fruit
oh the theory that everyone
meets a serial killer halfway thing
is that what youre saying
the wolf dont know why hes a wolf
the deer dont know why hes a deer
god just made it that way
youre saying the world itself
is predatory
that when a mountain lion
takes down an elk
its because its the
elks time to go
and all the bs liberal agenda
about saving the animal herds
only serves to overpopulate
the balance of nature
maybe youre right mickey
i dont think so
but maybe youre right
corporate predators
environmental predators
nuclear predators
life is a hunt
ive seen it i was there
when the
hit the fan at grenada
i saw it all go down at grenada
so tell me mickey
any regrets
three weeks 50 people killed
not too cool mickey
52 but i dont spend
a lot of time with regret
thats a wasted emotion
seriously you must have
some regret rack your brain
well i wish that indian
hadnt got killed
bad bad bad
bad bad
one of your last victims
man had a rattlesnake
sitting in the corner
a rattlesnake
could pick it up pet it
he saw it
he saw what
the demon
he saw the demon
the demon
what demon
everybody got the demon
in here okay
the demon lives in here
it feeds on your hate
cuts kills rapes
it uses your weakness your fears
only the vicious survive
all right you tell em
were told were no good pieces of shit
from the time we could breathe
after a while
you kind of become bad
after the indian
we were gonna quit killin
the old man
took it out of us
what happened

winner of the murrow
and the golden globe award
to name a few
i have been shot
you are on camera
we are live if anybody tries
to fuck up our escape
i will make it my lifes mission
to put dwight mcclusky
out of commission
i will do expose after expose
revealing the inhumanity
the brutality of the conditions
that exist here
you back up back up
my name is wayne gale i am the star
of american maniacs
youre all on camera
we are live
just how far do you think
youre gonna get
rlght out the front door

my name is wayne gale
i am a friend of bill clintons
if anybody puts me in danger
you open that gate
my name is wayne gale
i will personally hunt you down
blow the head
off your fucking whore wife
and plant your sick ass
into the ground all by myself
another day perhaps
but not today
this is wayne gale
unfortunately no longer live
i am wounded
all my crew is dead
i have left my wife
and my girlfriend has left me
look back up that was good
mickey knoxs plan worked
we walked out the front
into my news van
and made our getaway
when we were followed
by patrol cars
mallory shot deputy sheriff
duncan homolka
and tossed his body out the back
show em your ear
aghh
oh my god
that is so gross
why helicopters were not deployed
i dont know
my only thought is it all happened
too fast for arrangements to be made
wayne
weve pulled up alongside the road
to do this interview
tensions run high as we
we aint got all fuckin day
so without any further ado
mickey and mallory
so mallory after mickeys incredible
rescue what did you think next
i was just wondering
how long it would be
until me and mickey
could be alone together
and if i could wait that long
so did you have anything
to do with the riot
we didnt have nothin to do
with that riot
that was
whatchamacallem
faked
faked
they wanna say we masterminded
the whole fuckin thing
let em its not like
its gonna keep us up at night
but the truth is it was
fate
ah yes faked it was
and you saw it right here
on american maniacs
you believe in reincarnation wayne
yes i believe weve all
lived many times
so whats next for the knoxes
well im thinkin we can lay
in a big kingsize bed
and sleep for about two days
and ive been thinkin
about motherhood
so i think me and mickey
are gonna get started on that
as quickly as possible
gotta go
how do you two
intend to disappear
youre probably the most
famous couple in america
there is that underground railroad
okay end of the interview
let me just
swing the camera around
and do my wrap up
and were off
oh were gonna do
a little wrap up all right wayne
but it wont be you in the camera
lookin dumb and actln stupid
instead youre gonna be starin
down the barrels of our shotguns
and were blowin your brains
all over that tree back there
wait wait time
cut cut cut
thats a fuckin joke right
i thought during
this whole escape thing
a bond had built between us
no not really
youre scum wayne
you did it for ratings
you dont give a shit about us
or about anybody
except yourself
thats why nobody
gave a shit about you
thats why
helicopters were not deployed
wait a minute you fuckin hypocrite
what about the indian
you said you were done with killing
you said love beats the demon
you said that love beats the demon
i am and it will
its just that youre
the last one wayne
dont fuckin kill me
this is not about you
you egomaniac i kinda like you
but if we let you go
wed be just like everybody else
killin you
and what you represent is
a statement
im not 100 sure
exactly what its sayin
but frankenstein
