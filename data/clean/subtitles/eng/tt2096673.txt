core memories
each one came from a super
important time in rileys life
like when she first scored a goal
it was so amazing

powers a different aspect
of rileys personality
like hockey island

congratulations san francisco
youve ruined pizza
first the hawaiians and now you
what kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza
must be a san francisco thing
still its not as bad as the soup
at that diner in nebraska
oh yeah the spoon stood up
in the soup by itself
were good
familys running
the drive out was pretty fun huh
what was your favorite part
spitting out of the car window
definitely not when dad was singing
wearing the seat belt
oh what about the time
with the dinosaur
oh thats the one
for sure  say cheese
dad
honey
dad dad dad look at the car
just look behind you
nonono
ohh

i like that time with the dinosaur
that was pretty funny
wait what
what happened
she did something to the memory
what did you do
i i just touched it
that shouldnt make it change
oh change it back joy
im trying
you cant change it back
no i guess i cant
good going sadness
now when riley thinks of
that moment with dad
shes gonna feel sad bravo
im sorry joy
i dont really know
i thought maybe if you
if you i mean
joy we got a stairway
coming up
just dont touch any other memories
until we figured out whats going on
ok
alright get ready
this is a monster railing
and we are riding it
all the way down
wait what what happened
a core memory
oh no
sadness whatre you doing
it looked like one was crooked
so i opened it
and then it fell out
woohoo
its just that i wanted to
maybe hold one
woah joy
woah woah woah
sadness you nearly
touched a core memory
and when you touch them
we cant change them back
i know im sorry
somethings wrong with me
its like im having a break down
youre not having a break down
its stress
i keep making mistakes like that
im awful
no youre not
and annoying
the well
you know what
you cant focus on
whats going wrong
theres always a way
to turn things around
to find the fun
yeah find the fun
i dont know how to do that
ok well
try to think of something funny
oh remember the funny movie
where the dog dies
oh yeah thats not
what about that time with meg
when riley laughed so hard
milk came out of her nose
come on
yeah that hurt it felt like fire
it was
ok ok dont think of that
lets try something else
what are your favorite things to do
my favorite
well i like it
when were outside
thats good like theres
the beach and sunshine
oh like the time we buried
dad in the sand up to his neck
i was thinking more like rain
rain rain is my favorite too
we can stomp around the puddles
you know theres cool umbrellas
lightning storms
more like when the rain
runs down our back
and makes our shoes soggy
and we get all cold shivery and
everything starts
feeling droopy
oh hey hey easy
why are you crying
ththis is really the opposite
of what were going for here
crying helps me slow down
and obsess over the weight
of lifes problems
you know what
lets think about something else
how about we read
some mind manuals
huh sounds fun
ive read most of them
have you read this one
this seem interesting
long term memory retrieval
volume 47
no
ooh a real page turner
long term memory data selection
via channel subgroup b
see fun already
oh you lucky dog
youre reading these cool things
i gotta go work life is so unfair
ugh
what can we do we only got
capital to last a month maybe two
if we cant find investors by then
were gonna have to lay people off
mom dad
come kiss me good night
i know we got to land this ok
be right there

he looked like a bear
oh im so jumpy
my nerves are shot
ew i dont wanna
hear about your nerves
ill tell you what it is
this move has been a bust
thats what ive been
telling you guys
therere at least 37 things for
riley to be scared of right now
this smell alone is enough
to make her gag
i cant believe mom and
dad moved us here
look i get it
you guys have concerns
but weve been through worse
tell you what
lets make a list of all the things
riley should be happy about
fine lets see
this house stinks our room stinks
pizza is weird here
our friends are back home
and all our stuff
is in the missing van
oh come on
it could be worse
yeah joy we could be lying
on the dirty floor in a bag
ok i admit it
we had a rough start
but think of all the good things
no joy
there is absolutely no reason
for riley to be happy right now
let us handle this
i say we skip school tomorrow and
lock ourselves in the bedroom
we have no clean clothes
no one should see us
and we could cry until
we cant breathe
we should lock the doors and
scream the curse word we know
its a good one
now hold on
look we all have our off days
you know

want to say is
thank you
