  hm  this looks new 
  think it s safe    what is it 
ok  caution  there is a dangerous
smell people  hold on  what is that 
this is disgust 
she basically keeps riley
from being poisoned 
physically and socially 
that is not brightly colored 
or shaped like a dinosaur 
hold on guys    it s broccoli 
yuck 
well  i just saved our lives   
yeah  you re welcome 
riley  if you don t eat your dinner 
you re not going to get any dessert 
wait  did he just say
we couldn t have dessert 
that s anger 
he cares very deeply
about things being fair 
so  that s how you
want to play it  old man 
no dessert  oh  sure 
we ll eat our dinner 
right after you eat this 
arh

sure what she does 
and i ve checked 
there s no place for her to go  so   
she s good  we re good  it s all great 
anyway  these are riley s memories 
and they re mostly happy 
you ll notice  not to brag 
but the really important
ones are over here 
i don t want to get too
technical but these are called
core memories 
each one came from a super
important time in riley s life 
like when she first scored a goal 
it was so amazing 
hey  would you look at that 
very nice 
  woo hoo 
  yayy 
and each core memory
powers a different aspect
of riley s personality 
like  hockey island 
goofball island
is my personal favorite 
come back here 
you little monkey 
yup  goofball is the best 
friendship island
is pretty good too 
oh  i love honesty island

 pizza sounds delicious 
  pizza 
yeah  let s go for pizza 
great  let s get it 
  what the heck is that 
  who puts broccoli on pizza 
that s it  i m done 
congratulations san francisco 
you ve ruined pizza 
first the hawaiians and now you 
what kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza 
must be a san francisco thing 
still  it s not as bad as the soup
at that diner in nebraska 
oh  yeah  the spoon stood up
in the soup by itself 
we re good 
family s running 
the drive out was pretty fun  huh 
what was your favorite part 
spitting out of the car window 
  definitely not when dad was singing 
  wearing the seat belt 
oh  what about the time
with the dinosaur 
  oh  that s the one 
  for sure    say cheese 
  dad 
  honey 
dad  dad  dad  look at the car 
just look behind you 
no no no   
ohh 
nice one  joy 
i like that time with the dinosaur 
that was pretty funny 
wait  what 
what happened 
she did something to the memory 
  what did you do 
  i  i just touched it 
  that shouldn t make it change 
  oh  change it back  joy 
  i m trying 
  you can t change it back 
  no  i guess i can t 
  good going  sadness 
now when riley thinks of
that moment with dad 
she s gonna feel sad  bravo 
i m sorry  joy 
i don t really know   
i thought maybe if you 
if you  i mean   
joy  we got a stairway
coming up 
just don t touch any other memories
until we figured out what s going on 
  ok 
  alright  get ready 
this is a monster railing
and we are riding it
all the way down 
wait  what    what happened 
  a core memory 
  oh no 
  sadness  what re you doing 
  it looked like one was crooked 
so i opened it
and then it fell out 
woo hoo 
it s just that  i wanted to 
maybe  hold one 
  woah  joy 
  woah  woah  woah 
sadness  you nearly
touched a core memory 
and when you touch them 
we can t change them back 
i know  i m sorry 
something s wrong with me 
it s like i m having a break down 
you re not having a break down 
it s stress 
i keep making mistakes like that 
i m awful 
  no  you re not 
  and annoying 
the    well   
you know what 
you can t focus on
what s going wrong 
there s always a way
to turn things around
to find the fun 
yeah  find the fun 
i don t know how to do that 
ok  well   
try to think of something funny 
oh  remember the funny movie
where the dog dies 
oh  yeah    that s not   
what about that time  with meg 
when riley laughed so hard 
milk came out of her nose 
come on 
yeah  that hurt  it felt like fire 
it was   
ok  ok  don t think of that 
let s try something else 
  what are your favorite things to do 
  my favorite 
well  i like it
when we re outside 
that s good  like  there s
the beach and sunshine 
oh  like the time we buried
dad in the sand up to his neck 
i was thinking more like rain 
rain rain is my favorite too 
we can stomp around the puddles
you know  there s cool umbrellas 
lightning storms 
more like when the rain
runs down our back 
and makes our shoes soggy 
and we get all cold  shivery and
everything starts
feeling droopy 
oh  hey  hey  easy 
why are you crying 
th this is really the opposite
of what we re going for  here 
crying helps me slow down
and obsess over the weight
of life s problems 
you know what 
let s think about something else 
how about we read
some mind manuals 
huh  sounds fun 
i ve read most of them 
have you read this one 
this seem interesting 
long term memory retrieval 
volume 47 
  no 
  ooh  a real page turner 
long term memory data selection
via channel subgroup b 
see  fun already 
oh  you lucky dog 
you re reading these cool things 
i gotta go work  life is so unfair 
ugh 
what can we do  we only got
capital to last a month maybe two 
if we can t find investors by then 
we re gonna have to lay people off 
mom  dad 
come kiss me good night 
 i know  we got to land this  ok
  be right there 
did you hear dad 
he sounded really upset 
what was that  was it a bear 
it s a bear 
there are no bears
in san francisco 
i saw a really hairy guy 
he looked like a bear 
oh  i m so jumpy 
my nerves are shot 
ew  i don t wanna
hear about your nerves 
i ll tell you what it is 
this move has been a bust 
that s what i ve been
telling you guys 
there re at least 37 things for
riley to be scared of right now 
this smell alone is enough
to make her gag 
i can t believe mom and
dad moved us here 
look  i get it 
you guys have concerns 
but we ve been through worse 
tell you what 
let s make a list of all the things
riley should be happy about 
fine  let s see 
this house stinks  our room stinks 
  pizza is weird here 
  our friends are back home 
and all our stuff
is in the missing van 
oh  come on 
it could be worse 
yeah  joy  we could be lying
on the dirty floor  in a bag 
ok  i admit it 
we had a rough start 
  but think of all the good things   
  no  joy 
there is absolutely no reason
for riley to be happy right now 
let us handle this 
i say we skip school tomorrow and
lock ourselves in the bedroom 
we have no clean clothes
no one should see us 
and we could cry until
we can t breathe 
we should lock the doors and
scream the curse word we know 
  it s a good one 
  now  hold on 
look  we all have our off days 
you know   
hi honey 
the mom bad news train
is pulling in  toot toot

want to say is   
  thank you

you know  through all this
confusion  you ve stayed

at the bottom 
here 
wha     it s imaginary 
thanks  this will
make it a lot easier
to walk back to headquarters 
walk   we re not walking 
we re taking the train of thought 
the train  of course 
that is so much faster 
but how do we catch it 
well  it kinda goes
all over the place
but there is a station
in imagination land 
i know a shortcut 
come on  this way 
oh  i m so glad we ran into you 
the station is right in here 
after you 
  joy 
  what 
i read about this
place in the manual
we shouldn t go in there 
bing bong says it s the
quickest way to headquarters 
no  but joy 
this is abstract thought 
what are you talking about 
i go in here all the time 
it s a shortcut  you see 
d a n g e r  shortcut 
i ll prove it to you 
look at me 
i m closer to the station 
 cause i m taking the shortcut 
let s go around  this way 
almost there  now 
if you wanna walk
the long way  go for it 
but riley needs to be happy 
i m not missing that train 
bing bong knows
what he is doing 
he s part dolphin 
they re very smart 
well  i guess 
ok  what abstract concept
are we trying to
comprehend today 
ahm  loneliness 
hm  looks like there s
something in there 
i m gonna turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk 
what did i tell ya 
you ll be in headquarters in no time 
hey  will you look at that 
  woah  what s happening 
  oh no  they turned it on 
huh  never seen this before 
whaaat  
aahh 
my face 
my beautiful face  no 
  what is going on 
  we re abstracting 
there are 4 stages 
this is the first 
non objective fragmentation 
alright  do not panic 
what is important
is that we all stay together 
  oh 
  ah 
we re in the second stage 
we re deconstructing 
run 
ah  i can t feel my legs 
oh  there they are 
come here  me 
we gotta get outta here  before
we re not even shape and color 
we ll get stuck here forever 
bong  why did we come in here 
i told you  it s a shortcut 
the train 
oh no  we re 2 dimensional 
that s stage 3 
we re getting nowhere 
  depth  i m lacking depth 
  come on 
we can t fit 
oh no  we re not figurative 
this is the last stage 
we re not gonna make it 
ohh 
wait  we re 2 dimensional 
fall on your face 
stop  stop 
oh  no 
you said that was a shortcut 
i did  but wow  we should not
have gone in there 
that was dangerous 
they  really  should put up a sign 
  how long till the next train 
  who knows 
but don t worry 
there s another station  that way 
the train always stops there 
right before it goes to headquarters 
if we hurry  we can catch it 
this isn t another one
of your shortcuts  is it
