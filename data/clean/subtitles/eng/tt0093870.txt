good morning im casey
wong with jesse perkins
top story pretoria
the threat of nuclear
confrontation
in south africa escalated today
when the ruling white
military government
of that besieged citystate
unveiled a frenchmade neutron bomb
and affirmed its willingness
to use the three megaton device
as the citys last
line of defense
and the presidents first
press conference
from the star wars
orbiting peace platform
got off to a shaky start
when power failed
causing a brief
but harmless period
of weightlessness
for the visiting
president and his staff
well be back in a moment
is it time for that big
operation
this may be the most important
decision of your life
so come down and talk
to one of our qualified surgeons
here at the family heart center
we feature the complete
jarvik line
series 7 sports heart

the firm which recently entered
into a contract with the city
to fund and run the detroit
metropolitan police department
dick jones division
president ocp
every policeman knows
when he joins the force
that there are certain inherent
risks that come with the territory
ask any cop hell tell you
if you cant stand the heat you
better stay out of the kitchen
although seriously wounded officer
frank frederickson escaped
and identified this man
clarence boddicker unofficial
crime boss of old detroit

with the deaths of 31 police officers
today hes at large
while doctors at henry
ford memorial hospital

i usually drive when im
breaking in a new partner
you really think the old
man is gonna be there
why would they invite us
all division heads are bringing
their support teams
its big
i figure theyre
greenlighting delta city
what are you kidding they never
do anything ahead of schedule
its jones hes got the 209 series
online and now he wants to show off
oh thatsthats a tough
break bob
what what
well ed 209 ran into serious
delays and cost overruns
the old man ordered
a backup plan
95th floor have a nice day
probably just to light
a fire under jones ass
yeah
old bob here gets the assignment
yeah
nobody in security concepts
takes it seriously
its a better plan fucking jones id go
straight to the old man if i could
dont mess with jones man
hell make sushi out of you
yeah you better be careful man
i heard jones is a real shark
who asked you twerp
bob
what about this police
thing whats the problem
their unions been bitching ever
since we took over
you know the usual nonsense
well turn things around
mmmhmm good very good
lets get started
now friends
ive had this dream
for more than a decade now
a dream which ive invited
you all to share with me
in six months we begin
construction of delta city
where old detroit now stands
old detroit has a cancer
the cancer is crime
and it must be cut out before we employ
the 2 million workers
that will breathe life
into this city again
yes
although shifts
in the tax structure
have created an economy
ideal for corporate growth
community services in this
case law enforcement
have suffered
i think its time
we gave something back
dick
take a close look at the track
record of this company
and youll see that we have
gambled in markets
traditionally regarded
as nonprofit
hospitals prisons
space exploration
i say good business
is where you find it
as you know weve entered
into a contract with the city
to run local law enforcement
but at security concepts
we believe an efficient police force
is only part of the solution
no we need something more
we need a 24houraday
police officer
a cop that doesnt
need to eat or sleep
a cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it
fellow executives
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement
ed 209
the enforcement droid series 209
is a selfsufficient law enforcement robot
209 is currently programmed
for urban pacification
but that is only the beginning
after a successful tour
of duty in old detroit
we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade
dr mcnamara
well need an arrest subject
mr kinney
yes sir
would you come up and give
us a hand please
yes sir
mr kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure
mr kinney use your gun
in a threatening manner
point it at ed 209
yes sir
please put down your weapon
you have 20 seconds to comply
i think youd better do
what he says mr kinney
you now have 15
seconds to comply
you are in direct violation
cut the power pull the board
of penal code 113 section 9
you now have
five seconds to comply
help help me
four three two one
i am now authorized
to use physical force
its horrible
somebody want to call
a goddamn paramedic
lets go johnson
you pull the plug on this thing
all right dont touch him
dont touch him
he didnt hear the gun drop
he didnt hear it
oh god
dick im very disappointed
im sure its only a glitch
a temporary setback
you call this a glitch
were scheduled to begin
construction in six months
your temporary setback could cost us 50
million in interest payments alone
not necessarily sir
perhaps youre aware
of the robocop program
developed by myself
at security concepts
as a contingency against just
this sort of thing
thank you for your concern
mr morton
im sure this is something
now wait a minute
we can take up in my office
dick
get me out of here
maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective
tell me about your plan mr morton
how long will it take
were ready to go sir
weve restructured
the police department
and placed prime candidates
according to risk factor
im confident that we can go
to prototype within 90 days
good very good get your staff
together mr morton
ill expect a full
presentation in 20 minutes
thank you sir
yes now thats how its done
in the big leagues johnson
