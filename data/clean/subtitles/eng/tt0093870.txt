good morning  i m casey
wong with jesse perkins 
top story  pretoria 
the threat of nuclear
confrontation
in south africa escalated today
when the ruling white
military government
of that besieged city state
unveiled a french made neutron bomb
and affirmed its willingness
to use the three megaton device
as the city s last
line of defense 
and the president s first
press conference
from the star wars
orbiting peace platform
got off to a shaky start 
when power failed
causing a brief 
but harmless  period
of weightlessness
for the visiting
president and his staff 
we ll be back in a moment 
is it time for that big
operation 
this may be the most important
decision of your life 
so come down and talk
to one of our qualified surgeons

one critically injured 
police union leaders blame
omni consumer products  ocp 
the firm which recently entered
into a contract with the city
to fund and run the detroit
metropolitan police department 
dick jones  division
president  ocp 
every policeman knows
when he joins the force
that there are certain inherent
risks that come with the territory 
ask any cop  he ll tell you 
 if you can t stand the heat  you
better stay out of the kitchen  
although seriously wounded  officer
frank frederickson escaped
and identified this man 
clarence boddicker  unofficial
crime boss of old detroit 
now sought in connection
with the deaths of 31 police officers 
today  he s at large 
while doctors at henry
ford memorial hospital
fight to save the life
of officer frank frederickson

like he killed someone

any donations for the family may
be given to cecil as usual 
and i don t want to hear

murphy  front and center

i better drive until you
know your way around 
i usually drive when i m
breaking in a new partner 
you really think the old
man is gonna be there 
why would they invite us 
all division heads are bringing
their support teams 
it s big 
i figure they re
green lighting delta city 
what  are you kidding  they never
do anything ahead of schedule 
it s jones  he s got the 209 series
online and now he wants to show off 
oh  that s that s a tough
break  bob 
what  what 
well  ed 209 ran into serious
delays and cost overruns 
the old man ordered
a backup plan 
95th floor  have a nice day 
probably just to light
a fire under jones  ass 
 yeah 
 old bob here gets the assignment 
yeah 
nobody in security concepts
takes it seriously 
it s a better plan  fucking jones  i d go
straight to the old man if i could 
don t mess with jones  man 
he ll make sushi out of you 
yeah  you better be careful  man 
i heard jones is a real shark 
 who asked you  twerp 
 bob 
what about this police
thing  what s the problem 
their union s been bitching ever
since we took over 
you know  the usual nonsense 
we ll turn things around 
mmm hmm  good  very good 
let s get started 
now  friends 
i ve had this dream
for more than a decade now 
a dream which i ve invited
you all to share with me 
in six months  we begin
construction of delta city 
where old detroit now stands 
old detroit has a cancer 
the cancer is crime 
and it must be cut out before we employ
the 2 million workers
that will breathe life
into this city again 
yes 
although shifts
in the tax structure
have created an economy
ideal for corporate growth 
community services  in this
case law enforcement 
have suffered 
i think it s time
we gave something back 
dick 
take a close look at the track
record of this company 
and you ll see that we have
gambled in markets
traditionally regarded
as nonprofit 
hospitals  prisons 
space exploration 
i say good business
is where you find it 
as you know  we ve entered
into a contract with the city
to run local law enforcement 
but at security concepts 
we believe an efficient police force
is only part of the solution 
no  we need something more 
we need a 24 hour a day
police officer 
a cop that doesn t
need to eat or sleep 
a cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it 
fellow executives 
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement 
ed 209 
the enforcement droid series 209
is a self sufficient law enforcement robot 
209 is currently programmed
for urban pacification 
but that is only the beginning 
after a successful tour
of duty in old detroit 
we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade 
 dr  mcnamara 
 we ll need an arrest subject 
 mr  kinney 
 yes  sir 
would you come up and give
us a hand  please 
yes  sir 
mr  kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure 
mr  kinney  use your gun
in a threatening manner 
 point it at ed 209 
 yes  sir 
please put down your weapon 
you have 20 seconds to comply 
i think you d better do
what he says  mr  kinney 
you now have 15
seconds to comply 
 you are in direct violation   
 cut the power  pull the board 
of penal code 113  section 9 
you now have
five seconds to comply 
help  help me 
four  three  two  one 
i am now authorized
to use physical force 
it s horrible 
somebody want to call
a goddamn paramedic 
 let s go  johnson 
 you pull the plug on this thing 
all right  don t touch him 
don t touch him 
he didn t hear the gun drop 
he didn t hear it 
oh  god 
dick  i m very disappointed 
i m sure it s only a glitch 
a temporary setback 
you call this a glitch 
we re scheduled to begin
construction in six months 
your temporary setback could cost us  50
million in interest payments alone 
not necessarily  sir 
perhaps you re aware
of the robocop program
developed by myself
at security concepts
as a contingency against just
this sort of thing 
thank you for your concern 
mr  morton 
i m sure this is something
 now  wait a minute 
 we can take up in my office   
dick 
get me out of here 
maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective 
tell me about your plan  mr  morton 
how long will it take 
we re ready to go  sir 
we ve restructured
the police department
and placed prime candidates
according to risk factor 
i m confident that we can go
to prototype within 90 days 
good  very good  get your staff
together  mr  morton 
i ll expect a full
presentation in 20 minutes 
thank you  sir 
yes  now  that s how it s done
in the big leagues  johnson 
you see an opening 
you go for it 
you better watch your back  bob  jones
is going to come looking for you 
fuck jones  he fumbled the ball
and i was there to pick it up 
too bad about kinney  huh 
that s life in the big city 
when do we start 
as soon as some poor
schmuck volunteers 
unit 3509  proceed
to hall and grand 
411 involving indigents 
roger  we re on our way 
pretty fancy moves  murphy 
yeah  my son  jimmy  watches
this cop show  tj lazer 
and this lazer guy does this
every time he takes down a bad guy 
so naturally  my kid thinks
every good cop should be   
and you don t want
to disappoint him 
yeah  well  role models can
be very important to a boy
