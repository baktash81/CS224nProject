in an isolated pond in jamaica 
it sprouts out of
a pink fluorescent moss patch 
pink fluorescent 
mm  mm  mm 
this weed here  it s so good 
it could make a motherfucker
yearn for the afterlife 
it could send you to
the outer limits of humanity 
that s the keys and the trees
to my success 
 cause once a year 
i fly to jamaica 
they turn their cheek this way 
and we fly off that way 
  get out 
  mm hmm 
you don t remember
this  but the day you were born
and you came out
of your mother s womb 
i was there between your legs 
and your head came out
nice and smooth 
with guts all over it 
and it was a bloody mess 
but it was poetry 
aw 
    i saw your face 
but i didn t quite see your eyes
until i stuck my pinky finger
in this  like  placenta veil and
peeled it back over your face
and there you were 
and that s when i put my hands
on both sides of your head
and escorted you
into this world 
aw 
i want to say   
what s your name again 
for real 
  frank 
  frank 
  franky b

to put your hands
and take her into
the rest of the world

  thank you 
beautiful 
love you 
oh  shit 
in the dusk  you see   
you see that woman 
she s singing to us 
calling us back over the   
vistas of our past
right back to the child
who huddles under the piano 
he s sitting there with the boom
of the tingling strings 
yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah 
he s got his hand   
he s got his hand on it 
on the foot of his mother 
and she smiles as she sings 
and in spite of myself 
the insidious mastery of song
has betrayed me back once again 
till the heart of me   
   where i weep to belong 
oh 
that is the most brilliant shit
i ve ever heard 
you wrote that 
  yeah  i did 
  that is some wild shit  dog 
glad you like it  man  i wrote
that in my younger years 
whew 
actually  a guy named
d h  lawrence wrote it 
all right  but i stole it
and plagiarized it
in my seventh grade
poetry contest  and guess what 
i won that motherfucker

i was a little girl  
  our house caught on fire  
  i ll never forget the look
on my father s face  
  as he gathered me up
in his arms and raced  
  through the burning building
out on the pavement  
  and i stood there
shivering in my pajamas  
  and watched the whole world
go up in flames  
  and when it was all over
i said to myself  
  is that all there is
to a fire   
  is that all there is   
  is that all there is   
  if that s all there is 
my friends  
  then let s keep dancing  
  let s break out the booze  
  and have a ball  
  if that s all  
  there is  
  and then i fell in love  
  with the most wonderful boy
in the world  
  we d take long walks
down by the river  
  or just sit for hours gazing
into each other s eyes  
  we were so very much in love  
  and then one day
he went away  
  and i thought i d die  
  but i didn t  
  and when i didn t 
i said to myself  
  is that all
there is to love   
  is that all there is   
  is that all there is   
  if that s all there is 
my friends  
  then let s keep

to yourselves  
  if that s the way
she feels about it  
  why doesn t she just
end it all   
  oh  no  not me  
  i m not ready for that
final disappointment  
   cause i know  
  just as well as i m
standing here talking to you  
  that when that
final moment comes  
  and i m breathing
my last breath  
  i ll be saying to myself  
  is that all there is   
  is that all there is   
  if that s all there is  
  my friends  
  then let s keep dancing

how you doing  honey 
  i m okay 
  mm 
i m okay  how are you 
 when i was born 
i was happy 
i was born on the ocean
in a gigantic boat  
big fuckin  boat 
 my parents were fishermen 
 both were great
long distance runners 
 i was read to as a child 
 mostly books about
survival and contortion 
 i drank off the teats
of caribou 
 scrumptious  tasted like
jasmine and cupcakes 
   cause i remember    
  fuckin  good  moondog 
 i lived through several wars 
 they were never fun 
 why   cause i was shot at 
 but i fuckin  returned fire 
 i wrote letters to loved ones 
 i memorized winter haiku 
 i played games with myself 
 counted the lily pads 
stared in the mirror 
i did what i had to do   
to keep going  
  damn  i was good  man 
   i made sandwiches 
 i played the dance 
it was hot 
 it was dry 
it was raining  it was not 
i was fluent in all things
dealing with nature  
that s great poetry 
dot  dot  dot  dot 
come on 
what s  nothing  mean  huh 
nothing 
that s what it means 
not a single cent until   
till what 
you got to publish your novel 
or you get nothing 
uh   
minnie always had a feeling
she was gonna die before you 
she used to call me up
in a panic 
someone did her tarot cards 
predicted it all 
freaked her out 
but she was right  i guess 
her will is very precise 
minnie had a will 
motherfucker  that s weird 
yes  she did 
she was concerned that if
anything ever happened to her 
you d piss away
her family s fortune 
and she wanted you to finally
publish your novel 
  poems 
  whatever 
i write poetry 
you little bitch 
until then  half of everything
goes to heather 
and the other half of yours
sits frozen in escrow
for a bit of time
until you fulfill
the requirements stated here 
ah  it s about time
you guys got here 
i m gonna need some help
carrying my luggage 
if you re coming in 
kick off your shoes 
effective immediately 
you can go back to your home
and get your typewriter
and some crappy underwear 
but that s it 
you re now persona non grata 
minnie owned everything 
everything was in her name 
you re now  basically  a bum 
she owned the cars 
the clothes 
the houses

got an interesting life 
how d you pull it off 
how d you do it 
i only pull it off how i do it 
i mean  look 
i could tell you that i ve   
been trying to uncover the abyss
beneath my illusory connection
with the world 
i could tell you that it s
all written in the stars 
i could tell you
that i m a reverse paranoiac 
i m quite certain
that the world
is conspiring to make me happy 
all three of which are true 
but   
it s really
a little simpler than that 
i like to have fun  man 
fun s the fucking gun  man 
also  i like boats 
i like the water 
i like the sunshine 
i like beautiful women a lot 
and then i get
all these things going  man 
they re all turning me on 
my wires are connecting
upstairs 
and i start to hear music
in my head 
you know  and the world s
reverberating
back and forth 
and i hit the frequency 
and i start to dance to it 
and my fingers get moving 
my head s getting soupy 
i m spinning all over
the fucking place 
and the fucking words come out 
it s like it s a fucking gift 
what makes you  moondog 
different than all these
other people 
seriously 
you mean the ones up north
on the mainland 
the ones racing
to their red light 
the ones stuck in their ways 
a little bit too busy
to check inside
and say howdy  howdy  do 
that shit s not for me  man 
i mean  fuck  man 
so many people trip themselves
when they re running downhill 
life s hard enough  why would
you fucking want to do that 
i mean  fuck  we re here
to have a good time 
i just want
to have a good time
until this shit s over  man 
this life gig s a fucking rodeo 
i m gonna suck the nectar
out of it and fuck it raw dog
till the wheels come off  mmm 
  let me ask you something 
  come on 
  off the record 
  come on 
what s up
with the women s clothes 
  what women s clothes 
  motherfucker 
my phone was dead 
i held a funeral
for that motherfucker 
i had people giving speeches
in remembrance
of the time
when my phone was alive 
but it is back to life 
it has resurrected 
and the phone a is a ringing
off of the hook a 
calling you
motherfucking van gogh
with words  baby 
they calling you walt disney 
they want to freeze
your motherfucking brain
when you die 
but you was acting like
a little fuck boy for a minute 
and i had to admit   
true genius takes true guidance 
takes true pushing 
let me tell you something

that i introduce to you
mr  moondog

i had a lot in my life 
but i always had
this feeling like 
when i left   
   no one gonna remember me 
but knowing you 
being a part of what you did   
   maybe that means
something now 
i want to thank you 
you know what i liked the most
about being rich

be horrible to people 
and they just have to take it

  come on  girl  
oh  holy shitfire 
that was so much fun 
holy shit  huh 
that was a close one  wasn t it 
hey  yo  yo  yo 
  too late to stop now   
oh  what a fucking blast 
  looking for the moondog  
  is he fishing
in the moonfog   
  or running things
like a wild hog   
  never wonder
at the end  cause  
  we ve seen this act before  
  heard this monologue  
  he s a wanted man with
his head stuck in the sand  
  down and disavowed  
  being way too fucking loud  
  we got to get
a leash on that dog  
  woof  
  on that dog  
  he s always dancing
in the moonbeams  
  never cozy
in the mainstream  
  always sucking up
the moonlight  
  never really got
his mind right  
  melted like a fudgesicle  
  left out in the sun  
  time is running out  
  he s a man on the run  
  death of a dream  
  we ve got to plot a scheme  
  got to get his ass
out of town  
  hiding in the mangroves  
  till the coast is clear  
  take him up to disney world  
  get him out of here  
  looks like he s
having flashbacks  
  speaking lebanese  
  put him in a greyhound  
  heading for the keys  
  they need to never find
the moondog  
  keep him hidden
in the moonfog  
  a little ganja
and some good grog  
  keep it gentle
to the moondog  
  i was working
on a moon scheme  
  not exactly looking
downstream  
  watch him hoppin 
like a tree frog  
  hope he makes it
