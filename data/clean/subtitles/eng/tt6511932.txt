the outer limits of humanity

they turn their cheek this way
and we fly off that way

mmhmm
you dont remember
this but the day you were born
and you came out
of your mothers womb
i was there between your legs
and your head came out
nice and smooth
with guts all over it
and it was a bloody mess
but it was poetry
aw
i saw your face
but i didnt quite see your eyes
until i stuck my pinky finger
in this like placenta veil and
peeled it back over your face
and there you were
and thats when i put my hands
on both sides of your head
and escorted you
into this world
aw
i want to say
whats your name again
for real
frank
frank
franky b
now
i give you my daughter
to put your hands
and take her into
the rest of the world
aw
thank you

love you
oh shit
in the dusk you see
you see that woman
shes singing to us
calling us back over the
vistas of our past
right back to the child
who huddles under the piano
hes sitting there with the boom
of the tingling strings
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
hes got his hand
hes got his hand on it
on the foot of his mother
and she smiles as she sings
and in spite of myself
the insidious mastery of song
has betrayed me back once again
till the heart of me
where i weep to belong
oh
that is the most brilliant shit
ive ever heard
you wrote that
yeah i did
that is some wild shit dog
glad you like it man i wrote
that in my younger years

i was a little girl
our house caught on fire
ill never forget the look
on my fathers face
as he gathered me up
in his arms and raced
through the burning building
out on the pavement
and i stood there
shivering in my pajamas
and watched the whole world
go up in flames
and when it was all over
i said to myself
is that all there is
to a fire
is that all there is
is that all there is
if thats all there is
my friends
then lets keep dancing
lets break out the booze
and have a ball
if thats all
there is
and then i fell in love
with the most wonderful boy
in the world
wed take long walks
down by the river
or just sit for hours gazing
into each others eyes
we were so very much in love
and then one day
he went away
and i thought id die
but i didnt
and when i didnt
i said to myself
is that all
there is to love
is that all there is
is that all there is
if thats all there is
my friends
then lets keep
i know what you must be saying
to yourselves
if thats the way
she feels about it
why doesnt she just
end it all
oh no not me

final disappointment
cause i know
just as well as im
standing here talking to you
that when that
final moment comes
and im breathing
my last breath
ill be saying to myself
is that all there is
is that all there is
if thats all there is
my friends
then lets keep dancing
lets break out the booze
and have a ball
if thats all
there

of the good lord
we shall all be with her again
until that time

how you doing honey
im okay
mm
im okay how are you
when i was born
i was happy
i was born on the ocean
in a gigantic boat
big fuckin boat
my parents were fishermen
both were great
longdistance runners
i was read to as a child
mostly books about
survival and contortion
i drank off the teats
of caribou
scrumptious tasted like
jasmine and cupcakes
cause i remember
fuckin good moondog
i lived through several wars
they were never fun
why cause i was shot at
but i fuckin returned fire
i wrote letters to loved ones
i memorized winter haiku
i played games with myself
counted the lily pads
stared in the mirror
i did what i had to do
to keep going
damn i was good man
i made sandwiches
i played the dance
it was hot
it was dry
it was raining it was not
i was fluent in all things
dealing with nature
thats great poetry
dot dot dot dot
come on
whats nothing mean huh
nothing
thats what it means
not a single cent until
till what
you got to publish your novel
or you get nothing
uh
minnie always had a feeling
she was gonna die before you
she used to call me up
in a panic
someone did her tarot cards
predicted it all
freaked her out
but she was right i guess
her will is very precise
minnie had a will
motherfucker thats weird
yes she did
she was concerned that if
anything ever happened to her
youd piss away
her familys fortune
and she wanted you to finally
publish your novel
poems
whatever
i write poetry
you little bitch
until then half of everything
goes to heather
and the other half of yours
sits frozen in escrow
for a bit of time
until you fulfill
the requirements stated here
ah its about time
you guys got here
im gonna need some help
carrying my luggage
if youre coming in
kick off your shoes
effective immediately
you can go back to your home
and get your typewriter
and some crappy underwear
but thats it
youre now persona non grata
minnie owned everything
everything was in her name
youre now basically a bum
she owned the cars
the clothes
the houses
country club memberships
cats and dogs
she did not own all the cats
minnie loved you very much
she just hated seeing you
throw it all away

always sucking up
the moonlight
never really got
his mind right
melted like a fudgesicle
left out in the sun
time is running out
hes a man on the run
death of a dream
weve got to plot a scheme
got to get his ass
out of town
hiding in the mangroves
till the coast is clear
take him up to disney world
get him out of here
looks like hes
having flashbacks
speaking lebanese
put him in a greyhound
heading for the keys
they need to never find
the moondog
keep him hidden
in the moonfog
a little ganja
and some good grog
keep it gentle
to the moondog
i was working
on a moon scheme
not exactly looking
downstream
watch him hoppin
like a tree frog
hope he makes it
