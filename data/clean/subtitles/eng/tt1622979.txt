did he seem weird to you
when he got on the bus
no he was fine its like he just snapped
whats going on
what the hell is going on out here
we should uh
holy shit
get off the bus
come on
how did you know
thats the big question here
how did you know
it says right here in your statement
i saw it collapse
i knew it would happen
that sounds premeditated to me
no no no thats not what i meant
i had a vision
okay a vision
psychic phenomena ghosts bigfoot
you actually believe in that stuff
i dont know
ill tell you what i believe
theres an answer for everything
theres an answer for why
you knew to warn everyone
the bridge was going to collapse
and minutes later it did
i told you i saw it coming
i dont know how
i just did
and no one else did
like i said it just came out of nowhere
did sam have issues with authority
did he ever demonstrate
any sort of extremist behavior
no
wait extremist behavior
you mean like a terrorist
you see him talk to anyone that morning
on a cell phone pay phone
just his girlfriend
his exgirlfriend i mean molly
but that was in person
molly
ex
tell me about the breakup
was he upset scale of 1 to 10
its personal
you must have been pissed right
getting dumped like that
what does that have to do
with anything
im just trying to get all the pieces
of the puzzle together
before i start moving them around
making them fit
look i just had a hunch that something
bad was gonna happen thats it
knocking on doom
excuse me
forensics came back with the analysis
and
theyre chalking it up to high winds
and structural damage
from the construction
high winds
yeah send everyone home
youre free to go
i have a feeling
well be seeing each other again
call it a hunch
authorities are calling
the north bay bridge collapse
a freak act of nature
citing a highway improvement project
that may have weakened the superstructure
among the survivors were eight employees
of presage paper
on their way to a business retreat
the other 17 employees
were killed in the collapse
and although theyve been branded
the lucky eight
the surviving employees
now face an uncertain future
hey guys
hey
hey
anybody know
when this things supposed to start
when dennis gets here i guess
that agent still hounding you
no you heard the news
it was natural causes
yeah more like supernatural
how you holding up i tried calling
no yeah i saw i was just tired
so
how did you explain it
i didnt
i couldnt
sam there had to be a reason
heh that is exactly
what the agent kept saying
whatever answer youre looking for
i dont have it
yeah sams right
it doesnt matter how it happened
we should all just put it behind us
and be grateful were still alive
definitely beats the alternative right
i look out at the faces today
and i see family members friends
but the people that left us on the bridge
that day they were more than that
people like jennifer alcott
chris boylan
david buckler
maybe you worked next to them
maybe you worked for them
but we all worked with them huh
who can forget trevor winos smile
or isaac palmer
did he just say my name
thats not funny
i know im sorry
i just get weird with tragedies im sorry
i see dead people
guys
death
doesnt like to be cheated
excuse me
whats that supposed to mean
you all just be careful now
okay thanks for the advice
creepy guy

and i should have stopped her
i should have done something
i shouldve
peter there wasnt anything
you couldve done
how do you know
im sorry im sorry
hello agent block this is dennis
yeah peter just freaked out

does that mean anything
you told me to call if i saw anything odd
i dont know yet but thank you dennis
and call me if you see anything strange
stranger
should we maybe have code names
for one another do you think
over and out
all right ahem
show me how this happened
i dont think i can
what do you mean
i mean i could try it a hundred times and
never recreate exactly what happened here
this is some freaky shit
god
oh that actually felt great
oh yeah awesome
oh
wait are those things even sterilized
no no im not catching any diseases
unless ive earned them
wait a second you understood that
you speak english
oh
all right you know what
lets do this
two billion people cant be wong
i said wong you follow me
you get it youre chinese
ow ow okay its in its definitely in
ow okay yes it is in
how many of these are you gonna
put in me
oh uh hey
can you grab that for me thanks
hey
thats not very nice you know
okay your thumbs are kind of
in my eyes
im not gonna lie its a little annoying
once again chinese lady
i dont have a clue what youre saying
thirty minutes you sleep
sleep
oh
hey fire
hello
hey
hey hey
hey theres a fire in here
hey theres a fire
get in here
oh shit
you should come with me
to paris
yeah you know you said it yourself
like youre gonna have to start over
start over with me
how many drinks have you had
enough molly im serious
look you were right
if i dont take the job ill regret it
but im not willing to lose you
why does it have to be
one or the other
im better when youre with me
uh guys youre not gonna believe this
theyre saying it was a freak accident
yeah raise your hand
if you believe that
who dies during a massage seriously
first candice now isaac
it cant be a coincidence
its not
where are you going
its that creepy dude
why are you following us
who are you
you were at the cemetery
then the gym now here
what are you doing
my job
whats happening to us
what makes you think i know anything
you warned us
at the memorial service
you said death didnt like to be cheated
its just that ive seen this before
youve seen what
a lucky few survive a disaster
and then one by one
death comes for them all
you changed things on that bridge
theres a wrinkle in reality
and that wrinkle is you
so what were doomed to die
i mean is that it
we just got our lives back
so what kind of fucked up karma is that
are you saying that we cant stop this
you were supposed to die on that bridge
youre not supposed to be here
you shorted death
so you let death
have somebody else in your place
and then you take their spot
in the realm of the living
all the days and years
that they have yet to live
and they take your place in death
then the books are balanced
wait a minute we kill someone we get
their life is that what youre telling me
i dont make the rules
i just clean up after the game is over
maybe thats why
candice and isaac are dead
they werent supposed to survive
and now its coming after the rest of us
no
no not all of us
molly made it she didnt die
what
well when i had that vision
or premonition or whatever it was
i got you across
before the bridge collapsed
you survived
you saved her
why because you decided that she
deserved to live more than the rest of us
thats not what hes saying i dont
deserve to live more than anyone
you deserve to live
more than candice
whoa peter hang on
no look guys come on
youre not drinking the koolaid
are you
killing people
to survive deaths list really
i may not know whats going on
but its not what that guys selling
yeah what else is it then
shit
we need to tell olivia
come on
my forms are all signed
i see that its been quite a while
since your first consultation
what made you decide
to take the leap today
uh well a lot is going on in my life
and i just dont wanna miss anything
you know important
same reason i had it done myself
come on in back lets get you started
okay
oh
yep thats the first step
youll never need those again
here we are come on in
whats with these
oh just for some of
our younger patients
and um sometimes our older ones too
come on
what was that

than it really is
okay im gently going to
position your head
and i want you to tell me
when this feels snug
i cant move my head
perfect just what we want
there we go

sam
stay with me tonight please
of course
five different systems had to go wrong
for that laser to fail us
so spectacularly five
what do you want from us
i want you to tell me
what you think is going on
two deaths okay all right
thats a coincidence
three thats a pattern
now
i know you two didnt do this
all right
but i think you know something
what is it
we dont know anything
take a guess
we think we werent supposed to survive
on that bridge
what
and now something
is trying to set it right
something
thats all you got
right now yeah
but if you come up
with any other explanations let us know
thank you
something
hey
been up long
uh i dont know i couldnt sleep
i just kept thinking about the bridge
sam you cant do this to yourself
no no no no i was thinking about
in the premonition
we all got off the bus
but the ground gave way and candice fell
then the bus tipped over
and isaac he never got off the bus
he went with it
what are you getting at
i know that there was just
so much going on
look i know that i helped you across
then i reached back for olivia
but she didnt make it she fell
so first was candice
then isaac
then olivia
theyre dying in order
who dies after olivia
roy would you come
to the control room please
uhoh roy thats the boss
you in trouble roy
okay schoolboy
what do you wanna talk to me about
what is with your timecard
lets talk about my timecard
you out my hours
which means you cut my pay
i cut everyones hours okay
corporate has us operating at less than
50 percent until this thing blows over
my bookie aint operating at 50 percent
my dumb kid aint operating at 50 percent
roy
my exwife shes taking 50 percent
so ill tell you what im gonna do
no we gotta move man
hey im not going anywhere hey
look we gotta move gotta move
we gotta move now
roy you okay down there
hey dennis
hey
theyre closing us down
theyre shutting down the plant
not the plant just us
just sales and administration
can you believe it us
its the factory guys
that usually get laid off
not us were supposed to be safe
yeah dennis we got bigger problems
olivia and isaac are dead
whos isaac
isaac palmer tech support
wasnt he dead already
no dennis
listen its going to happen to us too
if we dont do something about it
yeah i understand
listen its called survivors guilt
no no guilt doesnt kill you
obviously youve never met my inlaws
im not fucking around here dennis
anyone could be next
it could be you understand
nobodys safe
what are you talking about
we werent supposed to survive
that bridge collapse
and so now its kill or be killed
you get that dennis
whatever
i warned you
do whatever you wanna do
i will
hey agent block its dennis um
listen pete just came in here
and hes just completely lost it
hes yelling about kill or be killed
oh yeah
it definitely sounded like a threat
what happened
i dont know i dont know
it just happened so fast
nathan are you okay
yeah
we heard and we thought
no no uh im good
did you kill him
what
no no i just
it was just timing you know
he got in the way and
no you did didnt you
you saw it coming and then you took
his life you put him in the way
no i didnt really do anything
tell us the truth did you or didnt you
hey peter calm down
did you or didnt you
did you or didnt you
yes i think i did
i killed him
so if the theory works
then you traded spots
he should have your death
and you should have his years
how do we know for sure
i think theres an order to these deaths
they mirror the order everyone died in
on the bridge
then who would be next
who wants to be first to tell me
what the hell happened
who is it sam
whos what
dennis it was dennis
no shit
jesus
why are you fighting me on this
youre not seriously going to work
are you
molly isaac died on a massage table
if death is gonna come for me
i dont think it matters where i am
you have to do something
what kill someone so i can live
no of course not
well just have to
figure something else out
i have figured it out
something saved me on that bridge
maybe it doesnt want me to die
maybe
we cant live our lives in fear moll
so if it happens tomorrow
or 50 years from now whatever
as long as were together

into traffic
