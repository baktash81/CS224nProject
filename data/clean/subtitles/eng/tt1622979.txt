molly  sam  come on  guys 
did he seem weird to you
when he got on the bus 
no  he was fine  it s like he just snapped 
what s going on 
 what the hell is going on out here 
we should  uh   
holy shit 
get off the bus 
come on 
how did you know 
that s the big question here 
how did you know 
it says right here in your statement 
 i saw it collapse 
i knew it would happen  
that sounds premeditated to me 
no  no  no  that s not what i meant 
i had a vision 
okay  a vision 
psychic phenomena  ghosts  bigfoot 
you actually believe in that stuff 
i don t know 
i ll tell you what i believe 
there s an answer for everything 
there s an answer for why
you knew to warn everyone   
   the bridge was going to collapse 
and minutes later  it did 
i told you  i saw it coming 
i don t know how 
i just did 
and no one else did 
like i said  it just came out of nowhere 
did sam have issues with authority 
did he ever demonstrate
any sort of extremist behavior 
no 
wait   extremist behavior   
you mean like a terrorist 
you see him talk to anyone that morning 
on a cell phone  pay phone 
just his girlfriend 
his ex girlfriend  i mean  molly 
but that was in person 
 molly 
ex 
tell me about the breakup 
was he upset  scale of 1 to 10 
it s personal 
you must have been pissed  right 
getting dumped like that 
what does that have to do
with anything 
i m just trying to get all the pieces
of the puzzle together   
   before i start moving them around 
making them fit 
look  i just had a hunch that something
bad was gonna happen  that s it 
 knocking on doom
excuse me 
forensics came back with the analysis 
and 
 they re chalking it up to high winds   
   and structural damage
from the construction 
 high winds  
yeah  send everyone home 
you re free to go 
i have a feeling
we ll be seeing each other again 
call it a hunch 
authorities are calling
the north bay bridge collapse   
   a freak act of nature   
   citing a highway improvement project
that may have weakened the superstructure 
among the survivors were eight employees
of presage paper   
   on their way to a business retreat 
the other 17 employees
were killed in the collapse 
and although they ve been branded
the  lucky eight    
   the surviving employees
now face an uncertain future 
hey  guys 
hey 
hey 
anybody know
when this thing s supposed to start 
when dennis gets here  i guess 
that agent still hounding you 
no  you heard the news 
it was natural causes 
yeah  more like supernatural 
how you holding up  i tried calling 
no  yeah  i saw  i was just tired 
so 
how did you explain it 
i didn t 
i couldn t 
sam  there had to be a reason 
heh  that is exactly
what the agent kept saying 
whatever answer you re looking for 
i don t have it 
yeah  sam s right 
it doesn t matter how it happened 
we should all just put it behind us
and be grateful we re still alive 
definitely beats the alternative  right 
i look out at the faces today   
   and i see family members  friends 
but the people that left us on the bridge
that day  they were more than that 
people like jennifer alcott   
   chris boylan   
   david buckler 
maybe you worked next to them 
maybe you worked for them 
but we all worked with them  huh 
who can forget trevor wino s smile 
or isaac palmer 
did he just say my name 
that s not funny 
 i know  i m sorry 
i just get weird with tragedies  i m sorry 
i see dead people 
guys 
death   
   doesn t like to be cheated 
excuse me 
what s that supposed to mean 
you all just be careful now 
okay  thanks for the advice 
creepy guy 
how s that foie gras  sam  waiting on you 
wasted like a drunk
she drank  drunk  drunk
stop it
it s not forgotten
thanks

i don t think i can

i mean  i could try it a hundred times and

this is some freaky shit 
god 
oh  that actually felt great 
oh  yeah  awesome 
oh   
wait  are those things even sterilized 
no  no  i m not catching any diseases
unless i ve earned them 
wait a second  you understood that 
you speak english 
oh 
all right  you know what 
let s do this 
two billion people can t be wong 
i said wong  you follow me 
you get it  you re chinese 
ow  ow  okay  it s in  it s definitely in 
ow  okay  yes  it is in 
how many of these are you gonna
put in me 
oh  uh  hey 
can you grab that for me  thanks 
hey 
that s not very nice  you know 
okay  your thumbs are kind of
in my eyes 
i m not gonna lie  it s a little annoying 
once again  chinese lady 
i don t have a clue what you re saying 
thirty minutes  you sleep 
sleep 
oh 
hey  fire 
hello  
hey 
hey  hey 
hey  there s a fire in here 
hey  there s a fire 
get in here 
oh  shit 
you should come with me 
to paris 
yeah  you know  you said it yourself 
like  you re gonna have to start over 
start over with me 
how many drinks have you had 
enough  molly  i m serious 
look  you were right 
if i don t take the job  i ll regret it 
but i m not willing to lose you 
why does it have to be
one or the other 
i m better when you re with me 
uh  guys  you re not gonna believe this 
they re saying it was a freak accident 
yeah  raise your hand
if you believe that 
who dies during a massage  seriously 
first candice  now isaac 
it can t be a coincidence 
it s not 
where are you going 
it s that creepy dude 
why are you following us 
who are you 
you were at the cemetery 
then the gym  now here 
what are you doing 
my job 
what s happening to us 
what makes you think i know anything 
you warned us 
at the memorial service 
you said death didn t like to be cheated 
it s just that i ve seen this before 
you ve seen what 
a lucky few survive a disaster 
and then one by one 
death comes for them all 
you changed things on that bridge 
there s a wrinkle in reality 
and that wrinkle is you 
so  what  we re doomed to die 
i mean  is that it 
we just got our lives back 
so  what kind of fucked up karma is that 
are you saying that we can t stop this 
you were supposed to die on that bridge 
you re not supposed to be here 
you shorted death 
so you let death
have somebody else in your place   
   and then you take their spot
in the realm of the living 
all the days and years
that they have yet to live 
and they take your place in death 
then the books are balanced 
wait a minute  we kill someone  we get
their life  is that what you re telling me 
i don t make the rules 
i just clean up after the game is over 
maybe that s why
candice and isaac are dead 
they weren t supposed to survive 
and now it s coming after the rest of us 
no 
no  not all of us 
molly made it  she didn t die 
what 
well  when i had that vision 
or premonition  or whatever it was   
   i got you across
before the bridge collapsed 
you survived 
you saved her 
why  because you decided that she
deserved to live more than the rest of us 
that s not what he s saying  i don t
deserve to live more than anyone 
you deserve to live
more than candice 
whoa  peter  hang on 
no  look  guys  come on 
you re not drinking the kool aid 
are you 
killing people
to survive death s list  really 
i may not know what s going on 
but it s not what that guy s selling 
yeah  what else is it  then 
shit 
we need to tell olivia 
come on 
my forms are all signed 
i see that it s been quite a while
since your first consultation 
what made you decide
to take the leap today 
uh  well  a lot is going on in my life   
   and i just don t wanna miss anything   
   you know  important 
same reason i had it done myself 
come on in back  let s get you started 
 okay 
oh 
yep  that s the first step 
you ll never need those again 
here we are  come on in

our younger patients 
and  um  sometimes our older ones too 
come on

than it really is 
okay  i m gently going to
position your head   
   and i want you to tell me   
   when this feels snug 
i can t move my head 
perfect  just what we want 
there we go

and you will feel a little numbness
in your eye

five different systems had to go wrong   
   for that laser to fail us
so spectacularly  five 
what do you want from us 
i want you to tell me
what you think is going on 
two deaths  okay  all right 
that s a coincidence 
three  that s a pattern

we think we weren t supposed to survive
on that bridge

and now something
is trying to set it right

with any other explanations  let us know

sam  you can t do this to yourself 
no  no  no  no  i was thinking about 
in the premonition   
   we all got off the bus 
but the ground gave way and candice fell 
then the bus tipped over 
and isaac  he never got off the bus 
he went with it 
what are you getting at 
i know that there was just
so much going on   
look  i know that i helped you across 
then i reached back for olivia 
but she didn t make it  she fell 
so first was candice 
then isaac 
then olivia 
they re dying in order 
who dies after olivia 
roy  would you come
to the control room  please 
uh oh  roy  that s the boss 
you in trouble  roy 
okay  schoolboy 
what do you wanna talk to me about 
what is with your timecard 
 let s talk about my timecard

which means you cut my pay 
i cut everyone s hours  okay 
corporate has us operating at less than
50 percent until this thing blows over 
my bookie ain t operating at 50 percent 
my dumb kid ain t operating at 50 percent 
 roy 
my ex wife  she s taking 50 percent 
so i ll tell you what i m gonna do 
no  we gotta move  man 
hey  i m not going anywhere  hey 
 look  we gotta move  gotta move 
we gotta move now 
roy  you okay down there 
hey  dennis 
 hey 
they re closing us down 
they re shutting down the plant 
not the plant  just us 
just sales and administration 
can you believe it  us 
it s the factory guys
that usually get laid off 
not us  we re supposed to be safe 
yeah  dennis  we got bigger problems 
olivia and isaac are dead 
who s isaac 
isaac palmer  tech support 
wasn t he dead already 
no  dennis 
listen  it s going to happen to us too
if we don t do something about it 
yeah  i understand 
listen  it s called survivor s guilt 
no  no  guilt doesn t kill you 
obviously  you ve never met my in laws 
i m not fucking around here  dennis 
anyone could be next 
it could be you  understand 
nobody s safe 
what are you talking about 
we weren t supposed to survive
that bridge collapse 
and so now it s kill or be killed 
you get that  dennis 
whatever 
i warned you 
do whatever you wanna do 
i will 
hey  agent block  it s dennis  um 
listen  pete just came in here
and he s just completely lost it 
he s yelling about  kill or be killed  
oh  yeah 
it definitely sounded like a threat 
what happened 
i don t know  i don t know 
it just happened so fast 
nathan  are you okay 
 yeah 
we heard  and we thought 
 no  no  uh  i m good 
did you kill him 
what 
no  no  i just 
it was just timing  you know 
he got in the way and 
no  you did  didn t you 
you saw it coming  and then you took
his life  you put him in the way 
no  i didn t really do anything 
tell us the truth  did you or didn t you 
 hey  peter  calm down 
did you or didn t you 
did you or didn t you 
yes  i think i did 
i killed him 
so if the theory works 
then you traded spots 
he should have your death 
and you should have his years 
how do we know for sure 
i think there s an order to these deaths 
they mirror the order everyone died in
on the bridge 
then who would be next 
who wants to be first to tell me
what the hell happened 
who is it  sam 
who s what 
dennis  it was dennis 
no shit 
jesus 
why are you fighting me on this 
you re not seriously going to work

molly  isaac died on a massage table 
if death is gonna come for me 
i don t think it matters where i am 
you have to do something 
what  kill someone so i can live 
 no  of course not 
we ll just have to
figure something else out 
i have figured it out 
something saved me on that bridge 
maybe it doesn t want me to die 
maybe 
we can t live our lives in fear  moll 
so if it happens tomorrow 
or 50 years from now  whatever

and i thought about it 
and i convinced myself that   
   yeah  i could 
so i went on a walk 
you know  nowhere in particular   
   but every couple of minutes 
an opportunity would just present itself
heh  like clockwork 
i could just grab somebody
and pull them into an alley 
or just shove somebody off a curb
into traffic 
you know 
it d be real easy 
peter  what did you do 
did you    
 no  i didn t 
i couldn t 
i realized that   
   i couldn t kill somebody
that didn t deserve to die

olivia didn t  dennis didn t 
i don t  
do i
