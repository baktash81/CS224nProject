  how do you do 
  how are you  miss 
  hello 
the government are trying to evacuate
as many children as possible
into the country 
  very sensible of them 
  today they sent us 45 
and i ve had to find homes for all of them
at very short notice 
these are the last three 
all right  children  pick up your things 
you re not suggesting that i should take
these children into my house 
exactly 
oh  i m sorry 
but that s quite out of the question 
children and i don t get on 
i believe you  miss 
  come on  back to london 
  hooray 
be quiet 
besides  i have work to do 
very important work 
miss price  you do have
that entire house to yourself 
and according to the order of the ministry
of civil defence  you have no choice 
i see 
very well  if that is the case 
i shall take them into my house 
with the understanding that you find a
more suitable home as soon as possible 
fine  come along 
ah  good morning  miss price 
there they are  oh  miss price 
what a charitable thing you are doing 
taking in these poor unfortunates
from the city 
  hold this very carefully 
  i wonder  miss price 
  if i may drop by later this afternoon 
  why 
well  we have their spiritual needs
to consider now  do we not 
that won t be necessary 
they won t be with me for long 
ooh 
upon occasion 
one does feel alarmed for miss price 
alone  unprotected 
living in that desolate lane 
one does admire her so tremendously 
one also admires miss price s sturdy
house  the four acres of desirable land
and the fine prospect
overlooking the sea  does one not 
 laughs 
i shall be frank 
one needs an anchor of domesticity 
a feeling that one
has a cozy place to return to
  as one fares forth to do heaven s work 
  oh  how is the vicar 
his wound is better  thank you 
oh  how marvelous for the vicar 
to be struck down not in his gathering
old age  but on the field of battle 
bringing in the wounded
and the helpless 
mrs  hobday

in the army  i mean

and i intend to make the most of it 
come on 
  bran porridge

an occasional sausage on the table here 
  a bit of strawberry jam 
carrie  charlie 
let me handle this 
and another thing  miss price 
there ll be no more of this
wash  wash  wash  morning and night 
anything else 
now you mention it 
i could do with a bit of lolly 
lolly 
 growls 
cash  cold hard cash 
you must have buckets of it 
for your information 
the most accomplished of witches
can t make money out of thin air 
have you ever heard of a rich witch 
be that as it may 
you don t want us to blab  do you 
have you considered what danger
you might be in 
i am a witch  you know 
 hisses 
  what will you do  turn me into a toad 
  lovely  a toad with pink eyes 
  i might just do that 
  go on  then  i ll dare you 
very well  charles 
you shouldn t have said that to her 
she don t frighten me 
she can t even ride a proper broom 
excuse me  charles 
filigree  apogee  pedigree  perogee
oh  charlie 
that s better than a toad 
that s a rabbit 
bother  i never seem to be able
to manage toads 
 meows 
stop  leave him alone 
don t let charlie get hurt 
oh  not to worry 
my spells don t last very long 
i m just an apprentice witch  you know 
 whining 
look out  charlie 
you flaming brute 
 screeches 
i ll teach you to do that to me 
let cosmic creepers alone 
weren t his fault 
i m afraid it s my fault 
bad enough
not being able to manage a broom 
i can t perform a simple basic spell 
you dared her to do it 
i don t see why we can t all be friends 
  maybe she s not a wicked witch 
  of course i m not 
see 
if only i could trust you 
you see  the work i m doing
is so important to the war effort 
  how do you mean 
  i mean exceptionally important 
most secret 
what do you say  charlie 
we can keep a secret 
yeah  if someone made it
worth our while 
  i don t follow 
  simple 
you give us something valuable
to seal the pact 
carrie 
oh  charlie  don t try to be clever again 
it s for our own protection  ain t it 
if we broke the pact 
we d have to give back the valuable object 
i think it s an excellent idea 
i wonder what i could give you 
would you settle for one of my spells 
bet that s not worth much 
come with me 
  i like you better as a rabbit  charlie 
  shut up  you 
well  i never had a rabbit 
this is my workroom 
no one has ever seen it before 
come along 
all right 
careful what you touch in here 
rum sort of place  ain t it 
when i signed for my witchcraft course 
there was a free bonus 
a certain marvelous traveling spell 
if you paid promptly in advance 
i think i ll give you that one 
  is it valuable 
  certainly 
  poisoned dragon s liver 
  poisoned dragon liver 
you mean you poisoned the dragon 
or just the liver 
well  it comes prepared 
it s part of the school equipment 
ah  here we are  the traveling spell 
all right  everybody  gather around 
all right  now  let s see 
does anyone of you
have a bracelet  or a ring 
  or something that you can twist 
  no  miss price 
what about you  paul 
always carry a few things
around with me 
you never know
when they might come in useful 
piece of blue glass 
lovely bit of string 
a horseshoe nail 
what s that 
knob  come from the bed upstairs 
  it twists  don t it 
  yeah  twisted right off 
yes  i think that will be all right 
carrie  turn the light down
a little bit  will you 
hellebore  henbane  aconite
glowworm fire  firefly light
  there  isn t that pretty 
  is that all we get 
this knob will now work
the famous traveling spell 
  and what s the famous traveling spell 
  how does it work 
well  you take this knob
and put it back on the bed upstairs 
then turn it smartly
a quarter turn to the left 
then  in a firm  clear voice 
tell it where you want to go 
and the bed will take you there 
  go on 
  miss price  will it  really 
well  i see no reason
to think otherwise 
oh  thank you for the lovely gift 
oh  i m sorry  but it does belong to paul 
he s the only one who can work the spell 
  me 
  yes 
that s right  mine  weren t it 
  that s the way the spell works 
  nice mess he ll make of things 
oh  bother  you children run upstairs 
but  mind you  don t try anything
with the bedknob till i get back 
 post rattles 
good morning  miss price 
i was just admiring the sound
workmanship of your lovely house 
miss price  yes 
  i was in the village
and as i was taking
my morning constitutional 
mrs  hobday asked if i might
deliver this letter to you 
oh  and i must say 
i did welcome the opportunity
of having another chat with you 
i always find them so refreshing 
miss price 
thank you very much 
emelius  dear madam 
it grieves me to inform you
that due to the war  we have been forced
to close down our college of witchcraft 
this means that we shall not
be sending you the final lesson
in which you expressed
so much interest 
carrie  we were wondering
what was keeping you 
  i ve had some very bad news 
  is there anything we can do 
no  no  thank you 
yes 
  yes  there is something that paul can do 
  me 
paul  i need the bedknob back 
  i must get to london immediately 
  no  i want to go to the jungle 
  oh  i know  but   
charlie  wait a mo 
  i ll handle this 
  charlie  be careful 
what you re saying  miss price 
is you now wish to take the object
which you gave to an innocent child
and get him mixed up
  in some kind of witch s hanky panky 
  well  yes  in a way  but   
well  a few odd shillings might
fix matters up  as you might say 
no  charles  money has got
nothing to do with it 
and as a matter of fact 
neither have you 
come with me  paul 
now  paul 
ridiculous as it may seem to have to
explain this to a 6 year old child 
but i do need your help 
go ahead 
i was expecting
a very important spell in the mail
from my teacher 
professor emelius browne 
  and it hasn t come 
  what s that got to do with my knob 
i must go to london immediately
and see professor browne 
with his help  we may be able
to bring this war to a successful end 
that is why i need the knob 
what is your decision 
thank you  paul 
i brought this for your hair  carrie 
it may be windy 
thank you  oh  it s ever so nice 
paul  have you been to the bathroom 
  twice 
  good 
charles  you better put on
something warmer 
the bed may travel quite fast 
i m not going  i m staying right here 
but why  charlie 
all that rubbish about a traveling bed 
it won t work 
  that s why 
  carrie  help me to pull the bed out 
we don t want to scratch the wall
when we take off  do we 
now  how s a ruddy big bed like that
gonna get out of this room
with those little windows 
i don t know  charles 
there s a great many things about magic
that i don t know 
we ll just have to find out 
lovely  just so s you leave me out of it 
i don t fancy making a fool of myself 
what s come over you lately  charlie 
you re no fun anymore 
miss price 
help me to tidy up the bed  carrie 
we don t want to go to london
with an unmade bed 
  how old is charles 
carrie  eleven  going on 12 
i see  that s what my father used to call
the age of not believing 
what s that supposed to be 
 singing  when you rush around
in hopeless circles
searching everywhere
for something true
you re at the age of not believing
when all the make believe is through
that s charlie to a t 
miss price  when you set aside
your childhood heroes
and your dreams are lost upon a shelf
you re at the age of not believing
and worst of all  you doubt yourself
throw that into the wastebasket 
you re a castaway
where no one hears you
on a barren isle in a lonely sea
what s that supposed to be  poetry 
where did all the happy endings go 
where can all the good times be 
everyone on the bed who s going 
you must face the age of not believing
doubting everything you ever knew
the knob  paul 
until at last  you start believing
there s something wonderful in you
lovely sentiment  i m sure 
miss price  are you ready  paul 
paul  yes  miss price 
miss price 
now  when i say go 
tap the knob three times
and turn it a quarter turn to the left 
  left 
  that s it 
miss price 
now  we better hold on tight 
the behavior of the bed
is something i m not quite sure of 
  hey  let me breathe a little 
  all right  paul  ready 
go 
one 
two 
three 
nothing happened 
  that s very odd 
  i told you it wouldn t work 
of course  how stupid of me  we didn t
tell the object where we wanted to go

my humble talents are at your command 
ah  madam  what have we here 
  you said you was stony broke 
  i don t keep money in me ear hole 
  it s a trick 
  yes  madam  a trick 
or to use a kinder word  an illusion 
but what isn t in these troubled times 
we live in a world
of fakery and false images 
  there he is 
  it is not what things are 
it is what they seem to be 
is that not so  madam 
that ain t the kind of professor
i expected 
i m not sure it s the kind of professor
miss price expected either 
you see  it really doesn t matter
what i do  what i do
as long as i do it   
   with a flair 
what effect a little smoke is 
with a dash of hocus pocus 
and the scent of burning   
and the scent of burning sulfur
in the air 
 singing   i m a fraud  a hoke
a charlatan  a joke
but they love me everywhere
  thank you 
  thank you 
ladies and gentlemen  for my
next trick  may i draw your attention
to this solid piece
of ordinary window glass 
framed in an ordinary
unprepared frame 
may i also draw your attention
to this perfectly ordinary steel nail 
now  i shall place the framed glass
in this brown  unprepared   
unprepared  mark you 
ladies and gentlemen 
unprepared brown paper bag 
i shall now attempt
to drive the steel nail through the glass
without breaking the glass 
 impossible   i can hear you say 
we shall see 
 glass breaks 
he ain t very good 
even if he is a professor 
emelius  singing  
and it really doesn t matter
what i say  what i say
as long as i say it with a flair
first i rattle off a ready stock
of gibberish and poppycock
and fix you with my best hypnotic stare
with my moans and groans
and soporific tones
they have cheered me everywhere
for it really doesn t matter
what i say  what i say
i said it when i tell it
with a  seemus alabeem 
the magicians  nursery rhyme
abracadabra 
you succumb    ooh 
to it every time
wave a stick and each trick
will mystify and disarm
in fact  to coin a fitting phrase
it works
 metal clanging 
 groans 
like a charm
so it really doesn t matter
what i brew  what i brew
as long as i brew it with a flair
though i ve never cast a magic spell
i make the motions very well
my showmanship is far beyond compare
i m a rogue  a rake
a mountebank of fake
but i do whate er i dare
what a waste of fresh eggs 
they ain t fresh  smell 
for it really doesn t matter
what i do  what i do
you buy my charms and poxes
 cause they come in fancy boxes
to improve your ugly daughter
i ve a vial of colored water
and my magic incantations
can be framed as decorations
though there s really nothing to it
and of course you all see through it
you love me  cause i do it
with a flair
now  friends 
i ll tell you what i m going to do  i m going
to offer you my entire stock of magic 
no  ladies  please don t go 
the prices are so low 
you will never cease to marvel at them 
don t leave now
and regret lost opportunities later 
you  young sir  would you care
to warble like the storied nightingale 
with this inexpensive device
you can charm the very birds
down from the trees  like so 
 bird singing 
  how much

of the brazilian matouacan bird 
known as the bird of love 
 bird sings

of the emelius browne
  correspondence college of witchcraft

well  there goes another rabbit 
  what was that about 
  i changed you into a rabbit
with one of your own spells 
my spell 
from my school 
miss price  not one of your best spells 
in point of fact 
it doesn t last very long 
some of your others are much better 
but i don t understand 
my spell 
they were just nonsense words
that i got out of an old book 
well  they work perfectly well for me 
they work for you 
good woman  some kind of destiny
has brought us together 
you got the words for these spells
out of some old book  you say 
well  more or less 
i changed them round a bit 
i gave them a bit of my own style 
as it were 
the old sorcerers did have
a bit of a tendency to waffle on 
but  dear lady  i never thought
i d meet somebody like you 
what a treasure 
mr  browne 
will you please stick to the point 
i would like to see this book
immediately 
certainly  it s at my new townhouse 
would you care to join me for luncheon 
we can discuss my ideas
at the same time 
thank you  we d be delighted 
 we   do these three jackals
belong to you 
miss price 
well  not exactly 
however we shall all go together 
  on the bed 
  on the bed  paul 
come along 
you go around the other side 
i always travel on the left 
will you give the address
to paul  please 
may i ask how we are going
to get there on this bed  fly 
my dear professor browne 
with your own traveling spell 
the one you gave with the course
as a bonus 
  my traveling spell  that works as well 
  just give the address  please 
8 winchfield road 
bed  take us to 8 winchfield road 
madam  is this vehicle safe 
oh  perfectly safe 
bit theatrical perhaps 
but then  most good spells are 
well  we re here 
i would never have believed it 
you must have given us
the wrong address 
you don t live here  do you 
in point of fact  i do 
temporally  at any rate 
i found the front door open 
the house was deserted 
everyone has left the neighborhood 
now  why should they do that 
this probably
has something to do with it 
miss price 
merciful heavens 
i should think you d be terrified
at the very idea of living here 
you would ve thought so  wouldn t you 
i am by nature a little bit of a coward 
but then i pondered  as i often do 
in the perverse nature of things 
this diabolical object is probably
the best friend i ve ever had 
it enables me  for the first time in my life 
to live like a king  shall we go in 
emelius 
rothchild  26  noble  worldly wise 
but with a charming touch of innocence 
wouldn t you say 
  mr  browne  the book  where is it 
  dear lady  you are relentless 
the book is in the library 
and we shall proceed there
after finishing our cheese and wine 
why do you keep the curtains closed 
so that we may enjoy
the gentle glow of candlelight 
more likely so as a copper don t peek in
and catch you hiding out here 
now  why don t you young things
have a look round the house 
  i wanna have a chat with miss price 
  may we 
yes  run along  children 
but mind you  don t touch anything 
remember  this house does not belong
to mr  browne 
mr  browne  where is that book 
i must have that spell
on substitutiary locomotion 
paul  what is it  a toy shop 
carrie  no  it s a nursery 
  ain t you ever seen a nursery 
  no  and neither have you 
and what is substitutiary locomotion 
substitutiary locomotion
is the ancient and mystic art
of causing objects to take on
a life force of their own 
why are you so interested in that 
because i know that
it can only help the war effort 
  i must see the nature of the spell 
  precisely  my good woman 
but now you must hear my ideas 
what are you reading 
 charlie reads title 
  can t be no such place 
  there is too such a place 
these pictures proves it  don t it 
charlie  bit weird  though  ain t it 
animals wearing hats and things 
oh  i like it 
now  would you hold this  please 
what do you think of that 
well  i don t know what to think 
miss price  just think
how successful i could be
with an assistant
who can really do magic 
  oh 
  dear lady 
have you ever considered entering
what some of us call  show business  
  the what business 
  the theater 
pantomimes  village fairs  the sea side 
brighton  blackpool  follies on the prom 
mr  browne 
i have very important work to do 
emelius 
listen to me  we could make a packet 
 singing 
let us strike a bargain
you possess a gift
but i can speak the jargon
that will give your gift the needed lift
  oh 
  you possess the know how
and i command the show how
oh  how successful you could be
with me
i m afraid we re wasting valuable time 
  what s your name 
  miss price 
  no  no  your first name  my dear 
  eglantine 
eglantine 
eglantine  eglantine
oh  how you ll shine
your lot and my lot
have got to combine
eglantine  eglantine  hark to the stars
destiny calls us  the future is ours
as the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit
all you need to succeed in your plan
is the proper ally upon whom to rely
and i m your man
for i have an acumen
that s nigh superhuman
i sell things that nobody can
so i humbly suggest
you accept my behest
i m your man
  eglantine  eglantine
  mr  browne 
oh  how you ll shine
  will you please stop 
  your lot and my lot
have got to combine
  eglantine  eglantine  hark to the stars
  mr  browne  do you hear me 
  destiny calls us  the future is ours
  mr  browne  i m warning you 
with my expert pantomiming
the proper taste and timing
i ll introduce you in the manner grand
i ll whet their appetite for you
i ll set the scene so right for you
we ll have the beggars
eating out of your hand
as the words sell the tune
and the moonbeams  the moon
all you need to succeed in your plan
is a champion rare
with a flourish
and a flair
and i m your man
do stop prancing about 
there s serious work to be done 
 singing  i have always had
a bit of a knack for witchcraft
common spells and simple charms
came naturally
so when the war began
i conjured up a plan
to do my bit
in the national emergency
i enrolled in your
correspondence college of witchcraft
and i slaved at every lesson
as it came
but the spell i counted on
is the lesson that is gone
it s disappeared
and you re the one to blame
your suggestions are rash
and your manner is brash
and i ve no time to waste
mr  browne
if i am to proceed
it s that book that i need
don t let me down
but if you ll see me through
i ll discuss it with you
though i ve no taste
for playing the clown
if i meet with success
then i might acquiesce
i won t let you down
eglantine  eglantine
oh  how you ll shine
your lot and my lot
have got to combine
eglantine  eglantine
hark to the stars
destiny calls us
the future
mr  browne  i m warning you 
i warned you  mr  browne 
now  where is the book 
well  where is it 
at last  mr  browne 
 miss price reads title 
of course 
oh  here s the traveling spell 
this is where you got it 
does one s nose
have to twitch like this 
oh  you re back  mr  browne 
miss price  a word about your tactics 
i don t mind being changed
into a hawk or a tiger 
or something with a bit of dash to it 
but always a fluffy white rabbit 
it s intolerable 
ah  here we are 
 substitutiary locomotion  
 the ancient art of     et cetera 
 the spell which creates this force
is five mystic words 
these words are    
but the rest of the book is missing 
now you see
why i closed down the college 
  but where are the other pages 
  haven t the foggiest 
  listen to me  mr  browne 
  i m all ears 
you will be if you don t pay attention 
where did you get this book 
well  i bought it from a chap
in the street market 
there was a bit of unpleasantness 
as a matter of fact 
he claimed that i d given him a dud coin 
i ask you 
there was a sort of scuffle  the book tore 
he got one half and i got the other 
but where s the other half now 
oh  it s probably been thrown away 
but if it still exists 
  there s only one place to find it 
  where is that

  no 
how about one of these  mate 
fell off the back of a lorry 
  do be a good chap and run away 
  would you fancy this  then 
ah  now you have my undivided attention 
what can i do for you  friend 
you re to get over to the bookman
straightaway  he wants to see you 
you too 
who is the bookman  and what right
has he got to order me about 
under the circumstances  i think we better
ask questions later  excuse me 
swinburne  half a mo 
why am i pushing this here flaming bed 
because  my friend  this magnificent bed
once belonged to the duke of wellington 
you see 
  i ain t sure i do 
  it is extremely valuable 
and i wish to give it to the bookman
as a present 
all right  all right 
i ll push the blasted thing 
i thought you would 
bookman  who is it 
  i brought the woman 
  and him as well 
bookman  well  send them in 
  in you come 
  right  in we come 
sorry  guv 
no one told me about the stairs 
why didn t you just bring
scotland yard  swinburne 
and half the household cavalry as well 
  what s the bed for 
  it s a present for you 
that s what he said 
nothing of the sort 
the bed belongs to me 
except for this knob  which is mine 
be that as it may  bookman  there s been
bad blood between us long enough 
let this glittering gift
begin friendship anew 
  draw the curtains and lock the door 
  you ll be snug as a bug 
mr  browne  isn t that the section
of the manuscript
  that we ve been looking for 
  who is this person 
miss eglantine price  a charming
young woman of my acquaintance 
miss price  i ve been looking
for this other bit a long time 
mr  swinburne told me
you were in the market making inquiries 
and here we are  i don t mind saying
to see it all together at last 
there isn t much i wouldn t do   
or haven t done  for that matter 
right  guv 
you ll close your mouth  swinburne 
is that clear 
it s all rather like a jolly detective story 
or jigsaw puzzle  isn t it 
we re both after the same spell 
you have one clue  i have the other 
yes  in that case  the sensible thing
seems to be for us to cooperate 
yes  i d rather cooperate with a cobra 
would you prefer that i ask swinburne
to take the book from her 
here  you  none of that 
  bookman 
  yes 
 chuckles 
i assume you re looking
for the same thing i am 
may i 
this is quite a moment for both of us 
 substitutiary locomotion 
the lost miracle of the ancients  
and so on and so forth 
ah  here we are 
 the spell which creates this force
is five mystic words  these words are    
 engraved on the star that was
always worn by the sorcerer astoroth  
bookman 
but where are the words of the spell 
i assumed they d be in your half
of the manuscript 
but i thought they d be in yours 
once again  a dead end 
i shall never know the secret 
isn t that old astoroth 
and there s his star 
it s a pity it s so small
you can t read the writing 
but why the animals 
towards the end of his life 
astoroth kept animals in cages
and searched for the spells
that would make them more like humans 
the legend is that finally
the animals rebelled at the experiment 
killed astoroth 
and stole many of his powers 
  including the star with the spell on it 
bookman  possibly 
they found a ship  sailed away 
and were never heard of again 
however  there is a final notation
in my half of the book
saying that in the 17th century
a shipwrecked lascar
was taken from the sea
half mad with thirst
and exposure to the sun 
before he died  he swore
he had seen an island ruled by animals 
  where 
  there is  i regret to say  no such island 
i looked for it in every chart 
the isle of naboombu does not exist 
oh  it does too  got me own   
  what is he trying to say 
  nothing 
when he don t say nothing  he burbles 
i wish the child to speak 
  now you ve done it 
  there is too such a place 
got me own book 
there  real pretty letters  ain t it 
let me see it 
you re not interested  bookman 
it s just a simple children s book 
bookman 
i ll be the judge of that 
  give it to me 
  no 
please don t annoy me 
  give me the book  boy 
  not likely 
bit of a stalemate  isn t it 
if it s all the same to you 
i d rather use me own 
sentiment  you know 
come along  paul 
i believe it s time to go 
go  how  my dear  the door is locked 
observe the fundamental weakness
of the criminal mind 
  you will believe no one or anything 
  i understand 
  the knob  paul 
  right 
of course you do  my dear  do you realize
we can tell them the complete truth 
they will believe nothing 
  he s up to something  you know 
  bookman  before your very eyes 
i shall cause this bed  and all
the occupants upon it  to disappear 
disappear 
i should like to see a cheapjack 
tenth rate entertainer do a trick like that 
cheapjack entertainer 
now  that was naughty 
  all right  paul 
paul  where to 
to the island of naboombu 
  i m very curious about that place 
paul  good 
bed  take us
to the island of naboombu 
enough of this nonsense 
get the book 
beastly climate 
i never did fancy the sea 
  where are we 
  naboombu  of course

like this before 
i m afraid we may have fallen
into the lagoon 
that s right 
here we are  on page three 
hoy  mr  codfish 
hello  young fellow 
welcome to naboombu lagoon 
now i m hearing things  fish don t talk

 cat meowing 
i don t suppose
i shall ever get used to this thing 
children  will you push the bed
back into place  please 
i think we could all do
with a nice cup of tea 
oh  no time for that 
i ve gone to a lot of trouble
to find this spell 
i m going to try it immediately 
mr  browne 
kindly let me have your shoes  please 
my sh    oh  fine 
  what s the shoes for 
miss price  really  charles 
if you d been paying attention 
i should think you d be aware
that substitutiary locomotion
is the art of causing inanimate objects
to take on a life force of their own 
obviously  i must have inanimate objects
to experiment with 
makes sense  don t it 
stand back  everyone 
i need plenty of room 
i want you all to be absolutely quiet 
mr  browne  you have the star of astoroth 
i believe 
oh  yes  it s in my nice  clean hanky 
it s all right  mr  browne 
i should have realized
that it would be quite impossible
to take an object
from one world into another 
if only i would ve had the sense
to remember the words on that star 
  i know the words  miss price 
  don t bother miss price  she s thinking 
charlie  why don t you and i
nip down to the village
and get something for supper 
and i might conceivably call into the pub
for a pint to steady my nerves 
  trebonna 
  i do know the words  miss price 
come along  paul  how can you know
the words when miss price doesn t 
  you wish to put this on miss price s bill 
emelius  that is correct 
  i don t believe we ve met 
  oh  allow me to introduce myself 
i am miss price s teacher 
emelius browne  from london 
professor browne  of course 
oh  how many times i ve seen your name
on your packages to miss price 
oh  extremely masculine handwriting 
i should have known 
professor emelius browne 
  the very same 
  i ll confess something 
such was the nature and frequency
of your correspondence with miss price 
i ventured the hope there was something
of a personal interest between you 
ah  if there only were 
miss price is a fine woman 
i most heartily agree 
we re very fond of her here 
  i m sure 
  in point of fact 
how many times i ve said to myself 
 oh  fortunate is the man
who can secure miss price for a wife  
well  one could say that  yes 
  you yourself are not married 
  alas  no 
these are strange and fearful times
in which we live  my good woman 
who could ask someone you cherish
to share such an uncertain future 
very well  don t say i didn t
warn you  professor browne 
one of these days  you mark my words 
someone will come riding out of nowhere
to seize and carry off miss price
before your very eyes 
i shouldn t be surprised  charles 
good morning 
and who was that  may i ask 
professor emelius browne from london 
he s come to see miss price 
a very good friend  i understand 
oh  indeed 
  that mrs  hobday seemed to fancy you 
  shh 
  i consider her a very dangerous person 
  what  her 
mrs  hobday is that most dangerous
of species  a matchmaker 
man  on radio  
  troop movements and massing of barges
in french and dutch channel ports 
the prime minister has told the nation
to be on the alert
for signs of a possible invasion 
that was the news   
to think i might have been able
to do something about all this 
it s out of your hands now  my dear 
if only i could have remembered
those words  it s maddening 
  why don t someone ask me 
  come off it  paul 
you can t remember
those kind of words 
you mean like
 treguna  mekoides  trecorum  satis dee  
treguna  mekoides 
trecorum  satis dee 
how do you know that 
easy  it says so right here in me book 
you mean it was there
in your book all the time 
yeah  but nobody ever listens to me 
treguna  mekoides  trecorum  satis dee
  nothing happened 
  shh 
am i doing something wrong 
well  to tell you the truth 
it does seem a bit old fashioned 
  after all  we are in the 20th century 
  what do you suggest 
well  it needs rhythm  tempo  music 
as i always say   do it with a flair  
do you mind if i have a go 
oh  of course not 
now  come along  you lot 
we need all the help we can get 
treguna  mekoides  trecorum  satis dee
treguna  mekoides  trecorum  satis dee
 singing 
substitutiary locomotion
mystic power

it s so weird  so feared
and yet wonderful to see
substitutiary locomotion  come to me
shh

treguna  mekoides  trecorum  satis dee
cor 
 meows 
 singing  treguna  mekoides
and trecorum  satis dee

or remote intransitory convolution
only one precise solution is the key
substitutiary locomotion they must be
treguna  mekoides
and trecorum  satis dee
ooh 
substitutiary locomotion  lovely
substitutiary locomotion
you ve made substitutiary history
with treguna  mekoides
and a little help from me

 yelling 
 cat screeches 
ah  aah  aah 
 crashing and clattering 
do you mind 
now  who would like some more
of my lovely sausages and mash 
  no more for me  thank you 
  oh  carrie 
that was very good 
but i ve already had two helpings 
  i m full 
  me too 
 meows 
well  at least somebody wants some 
cheer up  my dear 
this should be
something of a celebration 
i m sorry  there doesn t seem to be
much to celebrate 
  i still haven t mastered that spell 
  of course you have 
you just need a little more practice 
that s all 
  do you really think so 
  no doubt about it 
meantime 
there s nothing to liven the spirits
like a little master juggling 
  right  charlie 
  go on  then  guv  give us some juggling 
 humming 
very few better than me at this 
all you need is 20 years  practice
and a touch of genius 
 screeches 
 children laughing 
never happened to me before 
i don t usually juggle
with cats under my feet 
look  she s laughing 
 doorbell jingles 
oh

i just come by to bring you the good news 
  good news 
  yes  yes  mr  bisselthwaite
who brings the milk  you know 
well  he s promised
to take the children in 
he and his wife have got that farm 
just the place for growing children 
put a bit of color back in their cheeks 
why  what s the matter 
i thought you d be pleased 
you told me that you were much too busy 
you had no time to take care of children 
well  circumstances
have changed somewhat 
that s right 
we got a dad now  mr  browne 
miss price 
paul 
  miss price  is this true 
carrie  of course 
you do want him to stay with us 
don t you  miss price 
i suppose
i hadn t really thought about it 
what about him 
what do you say about it  mr  browne 
well  it    it s all rather sudden 
i don t quite know what to say 
oh  then i ll leave you two to talk it over 
oh  i ll come back in the morning 
  yes  good night  good night 
miss price  good night 
it is true  mr  browne 
you are going to be our father now 
aren t you 
well  we   
we are rather rushing things 
aren t we 
perhaps mr  browne has other things
besides you children to think about 
yes  well  as a matter of fact 
i should have left ages ago 
i must get a train
back to london tonight 
it s rather an important matter 
as a matter of fact  that had   
i d like to tell you about it 
but it s a little bit hush hush  you know 
sort of a secret 
well  if  uh   
if i ve been any sort of help to you 
i m pleased 
you ve been immensely kind 
thank you 
i ve enjoyed being with you 
perhaps it s been good for all of us 
will you be coming back 
someday  my dear 
i certainly hope
that we shall meet again  someday 
when all this war business is over 
i see 
and then  perhaps 
i shall realize my fondest dream 
eglantine and emelius 
illusionists extraordinary 
just think how that will look
on the poster  huh 
the children are going to miss you 
emelius  you really think they will 
miss price  yes 
well  i shall miss you 
all of you 
if i don t go now 
you might never get rid of me 
goodbye  carrie 
  must you really go 
  yes  l    i think it s best for everybody 
  goodbye  paul 
  i still think you should be our father 
goodbye  charlie 
do you want me to come down
to the station with you 
no  no  no  you stay here
and look after everybody 
  goodbye  miss price 
  goodbye  mr  browne 
 singing  no one to miss
if he s gone too long
no one to comfort
if things go wrong
that s how i want it to be
nobody s problems for me
no one who needs me
to ease his pain
no one to call me
his ball and chain
nobody s problems for me
and that s how i choose it to be
no troubles and strife
in this life that i lead
no tempers to humor
no hungers to feed
no one to warm
when the winter s cold
no one to pamper
no hand to hold
and that s how it always will be
no
nobody s problems for me
 seagulls caw

emelius 
emelius browne 
do you know you could be warm and cozy
in that house at this very moment 
for once in your useless life 
you really seem to have been needed 
you re a failure  emelius browne 
and a coward 
heller  no  fraulein  this is not
the invasion  just a little exercise 
a minor raid to induce panic
and to spread a little mischief 
when you english
get it through your head
that the german forces can land at will
whenever and wherever we please 
perhaps you will consider
reasonable peace 
not bloody likely 
go on  miss price  do it to him 
i must say  it s very tempting 
colonel  how would you feel about
being turned into a nice white rabbit 
 speaking in german 
i said  how would you feel about
being turned into a nice white rabbit 
be quiet  please 
filigree  apogee  epigee   
  not again 
  your memory  miss price 
charles  would you kindly fetch
my notebook from the workroom 
right o 
 speaks in german 
let go of that child this instant 
silence 
fraulein  we have work to do 
i am sorry 
but i must send all of you someplace
where you will no longer be a nuisance 
 speaks in german 
miss price  singing  
as the words sell the tune
and the moonbeams the moon
all i need to succeed in my plan
is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair
 soldiers speaking in german 
emelius  whispers  
eglantine 
 speaking in german

here it is 
 filigree  apogee  pedigree  perogee  
that s it
 speaks in german

 banging on door 
now  come along  my boy 
just for once in your life 
you ve got to believe in something 
that s it  good lad 
filigree  apogee  pedigree  perogee
 speaks in german 
miss price  now  what s the use
of putting the children and me
in that drafty castle 
  it s quite chilly  you know 
  because  fraulein 
the colonel believes when a british female
decides to become a nuisance 
she can become
the greatest nuisance in the world 
and i m inclined to agree with him 
miss price  i believe you need
a lesson in manners  sergeant 
if i only had my notebook 
i d make certain you d learn a few 
emelius 
jumping jehosaphat  more jerries 
 speaking in german 
paul 
take it easy  can t you 
  try holding your breath 
  i am holding it 
we could strip him down
and grease him with soap 
no  it s no good  we can t do it 
i could ve told you that in the first place 
if we can t get paul out
to give the alarm 
we ll just have to think
of something else 
what about that spell
that makes things move about 
miss price  oh  but i need weapons 
  how about all these things 
i m afraid they re a bit ancient 
  where did this come from 
  it s mr  browne  that s who it is 
he s on his way to london 
mr  browne 
if you are mr  browne 
would you be kind enough
to get down off my lap 
it is mr  browne 
it is you 
you didn t think
that i could do that spell  did you 
i am glad to see you 
but what about all these germans 
well  as charlie says  what s wrong
with the substitutiary locomotion spell 
that ought to be useful 
oh  but it isn t ready yet 
you saw what happened this afternoon 
we have to chance it 
we can t let these so and sos get away
with their beastly little raid 
mr  browne  won t you get up off the floor
and we ll go to work 
 soldier speaking in german 
 speaking in german 
 speaking in german 
  jolly good luck  my dear 
  thank you  emelius 
let s hope you haven t forgotten
the spell 
  oh  not this time  charlie 
  i found this in the castle 
probably not a magic broom 
but it might make you feel more at home 
well  thank you  carrie 
that was very thoughtful 
come now  children

that i could never be a proper witch 
when was that 
was it that first magic moment

my poisoned dragon s liver arrived 
i knew then that anyone
who felt the way i did
about poisoned dragon s liver
had no business being a witch 
you re certain
you re doing the right thing 
well  i think so  the way things are 
it s much too dangerous being a civilian
