for saving someone who
apparently didnt want to be saved
the plaintiff oliver sansweet
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by mr incredible
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in superior court
mr sansweet didnt ask to be saved
he didnt want to be saved
the injury received from
mr incredibles actions
causes him daily pain
i saved your life
you didnt save my life
you ruined my death
lawyer my client has no comment
announcer another suit was filed
by victims of the el train accident
incredibles court losses
cost the government millions
and opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over
it is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity
time for them to join us or go away
announcer under public pressure
and the financial burden
of an ever mounting series of lawsuits
the government quietly initiated
the superhero relocation program
the supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions
in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work
where are they now
they are living among us
average citizens average heroes
quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place
denied youre denying my claim
i dont understand
i have full coverage

a temperature of over 1000 degrees
completely bulletproof
and machine washable darling
thats a new feature
what on earth do you think
the baby will be doing
well im sure i dont know darling
luck favors the prepared
i didnt know the babys powers
so i covered the basics
jackjack doesnt have any powers
no
well hell look fabulous anyway
your boys suit i designed
to withstand enormous friction
without heating up or wearing out
a useful feature
your daughters suit was tricky
i finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does
your suit can stretch as far as you can
without injuring yourself
and still retain its shape
virtually indestructible
yet it breathes like egyptian cotton
as an extra feature
each suit contains a homing device
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button
well darling what do you think
what do i think bob is retired
im retired
our family is underground
you helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back
well i assumed you knew darling

prone to weakness
