no matter what happens 
hey  come on  we re superheroes 
what could happen 
announcer  in a stunning turn of
events  a superhero is being sued
for saving someone who 
apparently  didn t want to be saved 
the plaintiff  oliver sansweet 
who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by mr  incredible 
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in superior court 
mr  sansweet didn t ask to be saved 
he didn t want to be saved 
the injury received from
mr  incredible s  actions  
  causes him daily pain 
  i saved your life 
you didn t save my life 
you ruined my death 
lawyer  my client has no comment 
announcer  another suit was filed
by victims of the el train accident 
incredible s court losses
cost the government millions 
and opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over 
it is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity 
time for them to join us  or go away 
announcer  under public pressure 
and the financial burden
of an ever mounting series of lawsuits 
the government quietly initiated
the superhero relocation program 
the supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions 
in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work 
where are they now 
they are living among us 
average citizens  average heroes 
quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place 
denied  you re denying my claim 
i don t understand 
i have full coverage 
i m sorry  mrs  hogenson 
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17 
  it states clearly

 phone ringing 
 over phone  hello 
this is mr  incredible 
i m in 
the omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot 
its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem
it s confronted with 
and  unfortunately   
let me guess  it got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders 
we lost control  now it s loose
in the jungle  threatening our facility 
we ve had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety 
how am i going in 
the omnidroid s defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5 000 feet 
its cloaking devices
make it difficult to track 
we re pretty sure it s on
the southern half of the island 
one more thing  obviously it
represents a significant investment 
you want me to shut it down
without destroying it 
you are mr  incredible 
i ve got to warn you 
it s a learning robot 
every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you 
shut it down  do it quickly 
don t destroy it 
  and don t die

of anonymity 
surely  you of all people
understand that 
i was just wondering  of all the places
to settle down  why live   
with a volcano 
he s attracted to power  so am i 
  it s a weakness we share 
  seems a bit unstable 
i prefer to think of it
as misunderstood 
 chuckling  aren t we all 
volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on earth 
everything at the table
was grown right here 
  how does it compare 
  everything s delicious 
  jeez

with poofy lips who think only
about themselves 
feh  i used to design for gods 
but perhaps you come with a challenge 
eh  i was surprised to get your call 
e  i just need a patch job 
hmm  this is megamesh 
outmoded  but very sturdy 
and you ve torn right through it 
what have you been doing  robert 
moonlighting hero work 
must have happened a long time ago 
i see  this is a hobo suit  darling 
you can t be seen in this 
i won t allow it 
  fifteen years ago  maybe  but now 
  what do you mean  you designed it 
i never look back  darling 
it distracts from the now 
you need a new suit 
that much is certain 
a new suit  where the heck
am i gonna get a new suit 
you can t  it s impossible 
i m far too busy 
so ask me now 
before i again become sane 
wait  you want to make me a suit 
you push too hard  darling 
but i accept 
  e  it will be bold  dramatic 
  yeah 
heroic 
yeah  something classic  like dynaguy 
oh  he had a great look 
oh  the cape and the boots   
e  no capes 
  isn t that my decision 
  do you remember thunderhead 
e  tall  storm powers  nice man 
good with kids 
  listen  e   
  november 15th of  58 
e  all was well  another day saved
when his cape snagged
on a missile fin 
thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb   
stratogale 
e  april 23rd   57 
cape caught in a jet turbine

dynaguy  snag on takeoff 
splashdown  sucked into a vortex 
no capes

there s only one person
bob would trust

 creaking 
syndrome  it s bigger 
it s badder 
ladies and gentlemen 
it s too much for mr  incredible 
it s finally ready 
you know  i went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you 
but  man  it wasn t good enough 
after you trashed the last one  i had
to make some major modifications 
sure it was difficult  but you are worth it 
i mean  after all  i am your biggest fan 
  buddy 
  my name is not buddy 
and it s not incrediboy either 
that ship has sailed 
all i wanted was to help you 
i only wanted to help 
and what did you say to me 
fly home  buddy  i work alone 
syndrome  it tore me apart 
but i learned an important lesson 
you can t count on anyone 
especially your heroes 
i was wrong to treat you that way 
i m sorry 
see  now you respect me 
because i m a threat 
that s the way it works 
there s a lot of people 
whole countries who want respect 
and they will pay
through the nose to get it 
how do you think i got rich 
i invented weapons 
now i have a weapon only i can defeat 
and when i unleash it  i ll get   
 laughing  you sly dog 
you got me monologuing 
i can t believe it 
it s cool  huh  zero point energy

mr  incredible terminated 
e  this project has completely
confiscated my life  darling 
consumed me as only hero work can 
my best work  i must admit 
simple  elegant  yet bold  you will die 
  e  i just   
  i did robert s suit 
and it turned out so beautiful 
i had to continue 
it s great to see you  but i have
no idea what you re talking about 
  i just   
  yes  words are useless 
gobble  gobble  gobble 
too much of it  darling  too much 
that is why i show you my work 
that is why you are here 
edna mode 
and guest 
come  sit 
  cream and sugar 
  thanks 
  i started with the baby 
  started 
e  shh  darling  i cut it a little
roomy for the free movement 
the fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin 
e  and can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees 
completely bulletproof 
and machine washable  darling 
that s a new feature 
what on earth do you think
the baby will be doing 
well  i m sure i don t know  darling 
luck favors the prepared 
i didn t know the baby s powers 
so i covered the basics 
  jack jack doesn t have any powers 
  no 
well  he ll look fabulous anyway 
your boy s suit i designed
to withstand enormous friction
without heating up or wearing out 
a useful feature 
your daughter s suit was tricky 
i finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does 
your suit can stretch as far as you can 
without injuring yourself 
and still retain its shape 
virtually indestructible 
yet it breathes like egyptian cotton 
as an extra feature 
each suit contains a homing device 
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button 
well  darling  what do you think 
what do i think  bob is retired 
i m retired 
our family is underground 
you helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back 
well  i assumed you knew  darling 
why would he keep secrets from you 
he wouldn t  didn t  doesn t 
men at robert s age are often unstable 
  prone to weakness 
  what are you saying 
do you know where he is
