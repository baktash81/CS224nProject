  yo  peter parker

spider menace 
governments around the world
launch investigations
into the murderer

aka peter parker 
aka the web headed
war criminal
who  for years 
has been terrorizing
the decent citizens
of new york 
well  now this city
and the world

murderer  mysterio forever 
new details from last week s
devastating attack in london
have emerged 
for more  we go now to joint
intelligence headquarters 
authorities
just a short while ago confirmed
that the deadly drones used
in the london attack
were designed
by stark industries 
federal agents  open up 
federal agents  you stay here 
department of damage control 
we have a warrant
for the arrest of peter parker 
  you know the fourth amendment 
  sure 
unreasonable search
and seizure 
get in here  guys  let s go 
i didn t kill quentin beck 
the drones did  okay 
  the drones that are yours 
  no 
well  look  nick fury was there
the entire time 
ask him 
he can explain everything 
nick fury has been off planet
for the last year 
  what 
  peter  hey 
mj  they have nothing
to do with this  sir 
don t say anything
without a lawyer 
i want a lawyer 
  ms  jones watson 
  jones  i don t go by watson 
ms  jones  why do you
want a lawyer if    
if i have nothing to hide 
exactly  unless   
  i m actually guilty of something 
  mm hm 
i m very aware of your tactics
and my rights 
just answer my questions 
i ve seen your file 
you re a smart young woman
with a bright future
ahead of her 
why would you risk it all
by getting involved with
a vigilante like peter parker 
so sorry to keep you waiting 
  can we get ned a snack 
  absolutely 
  he s been waiting 
  i got you 
dude  i m so sorry about that 
i m not supposed
to say anything to you 
not even a thing 
i just have one question 
when mj told you
peter was spider man   
  whoa  whoa  whoa  heh 
  what s up 
i i knew way before mj did 
i was spider man s
 guy in the chair  
i know about those 
dude  half my guys
are guys in the chair 
exactly  you would know 
i literally helped him
find the vulture 
  i didn t know that 
  i helped him hack a suit once
and helped him get to space 
so in spider man s
illegal vigilantism 
you were his main accomplice 
i would like to have my words
stricken from the record 
with all due respect  and
i mean that very insincerely 
unless you have some real
specific charges to throw at us 
legally  you can t hold us here 
  you should definitely lawyer up 
  excuse me 
child endangerment s
a nasty rap 
a boy was entrusted to you 
and as his legal guardian 
essentially his mother 
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself 
but you actually
encouraged it 
who does that 
i wanna see peter right now 
stark
industries was caught in the web
of the spider man mysterio
controversy today 
when federal agents
opened an investigation
into missing stark technology 
agents wanna know
exactly what was taken   
at least they used
a good picture 
what is happening 
that s great  thank you 
well  i have
some good news  peter 
i don t believe
any of the charges
  against you are gonna stick 
  wait  seriously 
  i knew it 
  nice 
my god  mr  murdock  thank you 
  thank you  matt 
  that s amazing 
  you re welcome 
  perfect 
  however  mr  hogan 
  yes 
the feds are investigating
that missing technology 
i understand your loyalty
to mr  stark and his legacy 
but if you were involved   
  if i was 
  i advise securing a lawyer 
i need a lawyer because i m    
i thought he was   
you said there s no charge 
i could say
under advisement of counsel 
i refuse to answer
the question respectfully
because the answer
can incriminate me   
it s in goodfellas  what s the
thing they say in goodfellas 
i know that s what you think 
calm down 
let s hear what
he has to say  matt 
you re gonna need
a really good lawyer 
you may have dodged
your legal troubles
but things will get much worse 
there is still
the court of public opinion 
murderer  mysterio forever 
how did you just do that 
i m a really good lawyer 
we re gonna need
a safer place to live 
oh  ah 
how do we    
how do we    
alarm system deactivated 
it looks nice 
and this is safe

um  hi 
hi 
i m  uh   
the most famous person
in the world 
i know 
wong  try not to slip 
we don t have
liability insurance 
is all this
for a holiday party 
no  one of the rotunda
gateways connects to siberia 
a blizzard blasted through 
because someone forgot to cast
a monthly maintenance spell
to keep the seals tight 
that s right  he did 
because he forgot
  i now have higher duties 
  higher duties 
the sorcerer supreme
has higher duties  yes 
wait  i thought you were
the sorcerer supreme 
no  he got it
on a technicality
because i blipped
for five years 
  oh  well  congratulations 
  if i d been here  then   
you d burn the place down 
you two  no one said
stop shoveling 
so  peter  to what
do i owe the pleasure 
right  i m really sorry
to bother you  sir 
please  we saved half
the universe together 
think we re beyond
you calling me  sir  
okay  uh  stephen 
that feels weird 
but i ll allow it 
when   
when mysterio
revealed my identity   
my entire life got screwed up
and i was wondering   
i don t know
if this would actually work 
but i was wondering if   
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did 
peter   
we tampered with the stability
of space time
to resurrect countless lives 
you wanna do it again now
because yours got messy 
it s not about me 
i mean  this is really hurting
a lot of people 
my aunt may  happy 
my best friend 
my girlfriend 
their futures are ruined
just because they know me 
and they ve done
nothing wrong 
i am so sorry   
but even if i wanted to   
i don t have
the time stone anymore 
that s right 
i m really sorry
if i wasted your time 
  no  you didn t 
  just forget about it 
he will  he s very good
at forgetting things 
wong  you ve actually
generated a good idea 
what 
the runes of kof kol 
the runes of kof kol 
it s just a standard
spell of forgetting 
won t turn back time 
but people will forget
you were ever spider man 
  seriously 
  no  not seriously 
that spell travels
the dark borders
between known
and unknown reality 
it s too dangerous 
we ve used it for a lot less 
do you remember the full moon
party at kamar taj 
  no 
  exactly 
come on  wong 
hasn t he been through enough 
just leave me out of this 
fine 
fine 
so  what is this place 
the sanctum s built
at the intersection
of cosmic energy currents 
we weren t the first
to seek them out 
some of these walls
are thousands of years old 
and they shot an episode of
the equalizer here in the  80s 
well  i  um   
really appreciate you
doing this for me  sir 
don t mention it 
and don t call me  sir  
right  sorry 
you ready 
i m ready 
nice knowing you  spider man 
wait  excuse me 
the entire world s
about to forget
that peter parker
is spider man 
  including me 
  everyone 
uh  can t some people
still know 
that s not how
the spell works 
and it s very difficult
and dangerous
to change it mid casting 
so my girlfriend s
gonna forget everything 
is she even gonna be
my girlfriend 
was she your girlfriend
because you were spider man 
  i don t know  i really hope not 
  all right  fine 
everyone in the world s
gonna forget you re spider man
except your girlfriend 
thank you so much 
oh  my god  ned  ned 
what is a ned 
he s my best friend
so it s important to me
that ned knows 
okay  let s not change
the parameters of this spell
any more
while i m casting it 
okay  i m done 
i swear i m done  i m done 
but my aunt may
should really know 
peter  stop tampering
with the spell 
when she found out 
it was really messy 
i don t think
i could go through that again 
  so my aunt may 
  yes 
thank you  happy 
no  i m annoyed 
no  it s a nickname 
harold  happy  hogan 
he used to work with tony stark 
but then he was   
could you just stop talking 
basically everyone that knew
i was spider man before
should still know 
  did it work 
  no 
you changed my spell six times 
  five times 
  you changed my spell 
you don t do that  i told you 
and that is why 
that spell was out of control 
if i hadn t shut it down 
something catastrophic
could have happened 
  stephen  listen  i am so   
  call me  sir  
sorry  sir 
after everything
we ve been through 
somehow i always forget
you re just a kid 
look  parker  the problem
is not mysterio 
it s you trying to live
two different lives 
and the longer you do that 
the more dangerous it becomes 
believe me  i m so sorry
about you and your friends
not getting into college 
but if they rejected you
and you tried
to convince them to reconsider 
there s nothing else
you can do 
when you say   convince them  
  you mean i could have called them

i could do that 
you haven t called the    
i got their letter 
i assumed that was

osborn 
doctor    
be careful
what you wish for  parker 
let me out of here 
can you please explain to me
what is going on 
that little spell
that you botched
where you wanted
everyone to forget
that peter parker s
spider man 
it started pulling in
everyone
who knows
peter parker s spider man
from every universe
into this one 
  from every universe 
  who are you  and where am i 
i think it s
better we don t engage
with them because 
frankly 
the multiverse
is a concept about which
we know frighteningly little 
the multiverse is real 
this shouldn t even be possible 
  i thought you stopped the spell 
  no  i contained it 
it would appear
a few of them squeaked through 
after you left  i detected
an otherworldly presence 
i pursued it into the sewers 
where i found that   
slimy green son of a gun 
spell  as in magic 
what is this 
a birthday party 
who is this clown 
what is this madness 
watch this 
do you know a peter parker
  who s spider man 
  yes 
  is that him 
  no 
see 
okay  here s what we gotta do 
i don t know how many
visitors we ve got   
i saw another one
on the bridge 
he was like a
flying green elf 
he sounds jolly 
start with him 
i need you
to capture them 
bring them here
while i figure out
how to get them back
before
they destroy
the fabric of reality 
or worse  wong finds out 
uh  doctor strange 
what

dr  curt connors 
he was a scientist
at oscorp when i worked there 
a brilliant scientist 
until he turned himself
into a lizard 
then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards 
  it was crazy 
  it wasn t crazy  max 
it was the next step
in human evolution 
  the dinosaur can talk  right 
  lizard 
speaking of which
what happened to you 
last i recall 
you had bad teeth 
glasses and a comb over 
did you get a makeover 
you know i can give you
a real makeover 
let me guess  into a lizard 
  exactly 
  would you two just shut up 
  where are we 
  it s complicated 
  a wizard s dungeon 
  wizard s dungeon 
there s no real way
to sugarcoat that 
it s literally the dungeon
of a wizard 
you can keep your magic 
i want a taste of that
new energy i just felt 
  oh  peter  hey 
  did those guys come through yet 
there should be
an electric guy and a sand guy 
yeah  they re all here
and locked up 
perfect  i m gonna just
stay here for a bit
and try and fix
some of this damage
so they don t blame it
on me again 
  okay 
  but  hey  i  uh   
i couldn t do any of this
without you  so thank you 
yeah  of course 
hey  ask him if this is 
like  a tree monster
or  like 
a scientist
that turned into a tree 
it s just a tree  man 
just a tree 
coward 
we have a new world to conquer 
you make me sick 
leave me alone  please 
hiding in the shadows 
hiding from who you truly are 
  no 
  you can t escape yourself 
  hey  may 
  hey  peter  i m at work  and   
one of the guys you re
looking for just walked in 
may  where s may 
thank you 
may 
ah  hey  here he is 
norman  this is my nephew 
norman osborn 
i thought that you were   
i saw spider man
in an ad for this place 
and i thought
he could help me 
but you re not him 
wait  so you want
spider man s help 
he just wandered in 
i didn t know
where else to go 
someone s living in my house 
oscorp doesn t exist 
my son   
sometimes i m not myself 
i m someone else 
  mm hm 
  and every time he s in control 
  i can t remember 
  who  who s in control 
  and now i m here   
  who s in control 
  i don t know what s going on 
  okay  it s okay 
and i don t   
doesn t make sense 
he s lost 
and i don t mean just in
the cosmos  i mean in his mind 
are they all like this 
  yeah 
  yeah 
they all have their own
mental or physical issues 
oh  well  he needs help
and maybe they all do 
wait  you don t mean    
no  may  this isn t my problem 
peter  not your problem  hmm 
may  their chance
of getting help is way better
back where they came from 
sending them home 
that s the best thing
we can do for them 
for them  or for yourself 
look around you 
this is what we do 
  we help people 
  this is what s best for them 
trust me 
but the fact remains 
spider man is a menace 
we ll be right back
after a brief word
from daily bugle supplements 
the only other daily fix
you need 
and we re out 
what 
i got eyes on him 
he s with his aunt
and some guy

fighting spider man 
it was all over the news 
green goblin  impaled by
the glider you flew around on 
and a couple of years later 
you  doc ock 
drowned in the river
with your machine 
that s nonsense 
spider man was trying
to stop my fusion reactor 
so i stopped him 
i had him by the throat 
and then i   
  and then i was here 
  ah  please 
let me tell you something 
i was whupping spider man s ass 
he ll tell you 
and then he caused an overload 
i was stuck in the grid 
absorbing data 
i was about to turn
into pure energy  and then   
and then  uh   
and then    oh  shit 
  i was about to die 
  max  do you know  do i die 
oh  great 
you caught another one 
no  wait  strange 
he s not dangerous 
it s okay  um   
what is that 
it s an ancient relic 
the macchina di kadavus 
i trapped
your corrupted spell inside 
and once i finish
the proper ritual 
it ll reverse the spell
and send these guys
back to their universes 
and then what  we perish 
no  no  thanks 
i ll pass on that 
let me out of here  peter 
strange  we can t
send them back  not yet 
why 
well  some of these guys
are gonna die 
parker  it s their fate 
come on  strange  have a heart 
in the grand calculus
of the multiverse 
their sacrifice means infinitely
more than their lives 
i m sorry  kid 
if they die  they die 
peter 
don t 
  dude  what are you doing 
  peter  you gotta go  go  go 
  okay 
  get out of here 
this is why i never had kids 
  give me the box 
  no 
whoa 
  oh  my god  i m dead 
  you re not dead 
you ve just been separated
from your physical form 
my physical    what 
  how are you doing that 
  i have no idea 
you should not
be able to do that 
this feels amazing 
that s one of the coolest
things that s happened to me 
but don t ever do that again 
wha    hey  get off of me 
  la  la  
  tis the season
to be jolly     
  what is this place 
  the mirror dimension 
where i m in control 
strange  stop  can we
please just talk about this 
parker  don t you realize
that in the multiverse
there are an infinite number
of people
who know peter parker
is spider man 
and if that spell gets loose 
they re all coming here 
i know  i get it  but we can t
just send them home to die 
it s their fate 
you can t change that
any more than you could
change who they are 
but what if we could  what if
we could change their fate 
whoa  oh  what are you doing 
i m not giving you the    whoa 
whoa  whoa 
give me that back 
wait a minute 
is that an archimedean spiral 
the mirror dimension
is just geometry 
you re great at geometry 
you can do geometry 
square the radius 
divide by pi 
  plot points along the curve 
  it s over  parker 
i ll come pick you up
when it s done 
hey  strange 
you know
what s cooler than magic 
  math 
  don t do this 
  ow 
  i m sorry  sir  but   
   i have to try 
  what happened 
  i fought with strange and won 
  what 
  look  i stole his ring thing 
i was swinging through the city 
and then i went through
this massive mirror thing 
and then i was back in   
  where is he 
  he s trapped 
  but i m not sure for how long 
  you could have left us to die 
why didn t you 
because that s not who he is 
i think i can help you guys 
if i can fix what happened
to you  then when you go back 
things will be different 
and you might not die
fighting spider man 
  what do you mean fix us 
  our technology is advanced   
i can help you  you know  i m
something of a scientist myself 
octavius knows what i can do 
fix  you mean like a dog 
i refuse 
i can t promise
you guys anything 
but at least this way  you get
to go home and have a chance 
a second chance 
come on 
isn t that worth trying 
trust me  peter 
when you try to fix people 
there are always consequences 
i mean  you don t have to come 
i also didn t know
that you could talk 
but if you stay here 
you re gonna have to deal
with the wizard 
ah  so we go along or die 
not much of a choice  is it 
  i just wanna go home 
  well  i  myself 
don t wanna be killed 
especially by a guy dressed
like dungeons   dragons 
so  what s your plan 
i have it all under control 
what are we
gonna do about this thing 
uh  well  we need to find
somewhere safe for it  right 
  yeah  sure  you gotta take it 
  wait  what 
if something bad happens 
you just push this 
  and then it s all over 
  we re not gonna leave you 
you can t  it s dangerous 
you ve done enough 
  we re in this together 
  i know we re in this together 
but i can t do this
if you re in danger 
okay  so for me  mj 
please just take this 
  please 
  fine 
  thank you 
  but  peter 
if i don t hear from you 
i m pressing the button 
  sure 
  okay  and i will do it

new yorkers

  oh  sorry 
so this is your plan  peter  hm 
no lab  no facilities 
just performing miracles
in a condominium  hm

some cures
and some frozen burritos
in a microwave 
  i could go for a burrito 
  he s gonna kill us all 
well  let s hope not 
  you re up first  doc 
  what 
hey  i told you 
i don t need fixing 
i don t need fixing 
especially by a teenager
using scraps
from a bachelor s junk drawer 
nah  nah  nah 
he got something back there 
i can feel it 
that weird energy 
what the hell is that 
it s a fabricator 
it can analyze  design 
construct basically anything 
i thought that was
the tanning bed happy broke 
look at that 
he s gonna kill us all 
whoa  what s going on there 
so the chip in
the back of doc s neck
was designed to protect
his brain from the ai system
that s controlling
these tentacles 
but if you look here   
the chip is fried 
so rather than him being
in control of the tentacles 
the tentacles are now
in control of him 
which  i guess  explains why
he is so miserable all the time 
thirsty 
well  yes  i am thirsty 
fresh water or salt 
you know 
because you re an octopus 
what 
fresh water it is 
look at this place 
  and all the possibilities 
  what  this condo 
yeah  yeah  the condo  i love
the whole open floor plan  no 
no  man 
i m talking about the world 
i kind of like who i am here 
and all that power back there   
i could be so much more 
so why d you come along 
i have a daughter 
and i want to see her 
but he s not gonna
send anyone home
till he s finished his little
science project back there 
you trust him 
i don t trust anyone 
how d you end up
like that anyway 
oh   
the place where i worked at 
they were experimenting
with electricity
created by living organisms 
and then  uh   
i fell into
a vat of electric eels 
you re kidding 
i fell into a supercollider 
damn 
gotta be careful
where you fall 
remarkable 
the technology and you 
when all this is over 
if you need a job
and you re willing to commute
to another universe   
it worked  that totally worked 
i got it  i did it 
uh  will you send him up 
here we go 
  sorry 
  hold on  doc 
oh  will these humiliations
never cease 
you  keep your science fair
project away from me 
it ll work  have faith 
says the reckless fool who
turned himself into a monster 
please stop moving your head

but i ve been trying
to find your friend
ever since i got here 
i just have this sense that   
that he needs my help 
our help 
he does 
we don t know where he is 
and  um  honestly  right now
we re all he really has left 
well  uh  is there someplace
that he might go
that has meaning to him 
like a place
where he would go to just    
get away from everything 
for me  it was the top
of the chrysler building 
empire state 
  it s a better view 
  that is a sweet view 
yes 
yeah  i    i think i know
exactly where that would be 
i m sorry 
peter  there s   
there s some people here 
  what 
  um   
hey  wait  wait  whoa 
what    
sorry   
about may

i got some understanding
of what it is you re   
no  please don t tell me that
you know what i m going through 
  okay 
  she s gone 
and it s all my fault 
she died for nothing 
so i m gonna do what i should
have done in the first place 
  peter   
  please don t 
you don t belong here 
either of you 
so i m sending you home 
those other guys
are from your worlds  right 
so you deal with it 
if they die  if you kill them   
that s on you 
it s not my problem 
i don t care anymore 
i m done 
i m really sorry
that i dragged you into this 
but you have to go home now 
good luck 
my uncle ben was killed 
it was my fault 
i lost   
i lost gwen  my  um   
she was my mj 
i couldn t save her 
i m never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that 
but i carried on 
tried to  um   
tried to keep going 
tried to keep being the  uh   
the friendly neighborhood
spider man
 cause i know that s what
she would ve wanted 
but at some point  i just   
i stopped pulling my punches 
i got rageful 
i got bitter 
i just don t want you
to end up like    like me 
the night ben died   
i hunted down the man
who i thought did it 
i wanted him dead 
i got what i wanted 
it didn t make it better 
it took me a long time   
to learn to get through
that darkness 
i wanna kill him 
i wanna tear him apart 
i can still hear
her voice in my head 
even after she was hurt 
she said to me
that we did the right thing 
she told me
that with great power   
comes great responsibility 
wait  what 
how do you know that 
uncle ben said it 
the day he died 
maybe she didn t die
for nothing  peter 
okay  so  uh  connors 
marko  dillon and  um   
i think that i can repair the
devices for dillon and marko 
but the others   
oh  i got connors  i ve cured
him once  so no big deal 
  what  it s no big deal 
  great 
yeah  that s great 
i think i can make
an anti serum for dr  osborn 
been thinking about it
a long time 
gotta cure all of them  right 
right 
that s what we do 
what 
just three yous 
um   
so do you have
a best friend too

and spider man s cultists
continue to contend that
the vile vigilante is a hero 
well  if he were a hero 
he d unmask himself
and tell us who he really is 
because only a coward
conceals his identity 
only a coward hides
his true intentions 
rest assured 
ladies and gentlemen 
this reporter will uncover
those intentions
come hell or high water

feels different
this time for some reason

  something that stimulates
my music in my measure  
  measure in the music

   cause seein  and doin

  doin  hip hop hustle
no rock  n  roll  
  unless your name s brewster
 cause brewster s a punk  
  parents let go  cause
there s magic in the air  
  criticizing rap
shows you re out of order  
  stop  look and listen
to the phrasin  fred astaires  
  and don t get offended while
mase do si do s your daughter  
  a tricameral system

y all  and y all can bet  
  that the action s not a trick
but sho nuff a function

a daisy grows in your mind  
  showing true position
this here piece is  
  kissin  the part of the pie
that s missin   
  when that negative number
fills up your casualty  
    three  
    maybe you can subtract it  
  you can call it
your lucky partner  
  maybe you can call it
your adjective  
  but odd as it may be  
  without my one and two
where would there be  
  my three
mase  pos and me   
  and that s the magic number  
  what does it all mean   
  focus is formed
by flaunts of the soul  
  souls who flaunt styles
gain praises by pounds  
  common are speakers
who honor the scroll  
  scroll written daily
creates a new sound  
  listeners listen
 cause this here is wisdom  
  wisdom of a speaker
a dove and a plug  
  set aside a legal substance
to feed  em  
  for now get  em high
off this dialect drug  
  time is a factor
so it s time to count  
  count not
the negative actions of one  
  speakers of soul
say it s time to shout  
  three forms of soul
to a positive sum  
  dance to this fix
and flex every muscle  
  space can be filled
if you rise like my lumber  
  advance to the tune
but don t do the hustle  
  shake  rattle  roll
to my magic number  
  now you may
try to subtract it  
  but it just won t go away  
  three times one  
  what is it   
  one time three times one  
  what is it   
  three times one  
    what is it   
    three  
  that s a magic number  
okay 
okay  i think i got this 
you re saying that
this whole place here 
it s just tons of   
superpeople 
and he has been
saying it for hours 
all right  tell me again 
i m sorry  i m an idiot 
there was a billionaire 
he had a tin suit
and he could fly  right 
okay  and there was
a really angry green man 
  hulk 
  hulk 
and you thought lethal
protector was a shit name 
yeah  because it is 
now tell me again
about your purple alien
that loves stones 
 cause i ll tell you what  man 
aliens do not love stones 
  eddie  don t start 
  they don t 
know what aliens love 
eating brains 
because that s what they do 
all right 
señor  he made
my family disappear 
for five years 
five years 
that s a long time 
maybe i   
maybe i should go to new york
and speak to this   
spider man 
eddie  we are drunk 
let s go skinny dip 
i don t think
we should skinny dip 
you have to pay the bill 
what is happening  no 
no  we just got here 
no  not again 
and there he goes 
without paying the bill 
no tips  nothing 
don t cast that spell 
  it s too dangerous 
  why 
we tampered with
the stability of space time 
the multiverse is a concept
about which we know
frighteningly little 
your desecration of reality   
will not go unpunished 
it was the only way 
but i never meant
for any of this to happen 
wanda 
well  i knew sooner or later
you d show up 
i made mistakes 
and people were hurt 
i m not here to talk
about westview 
then what are you here for 
we need your help 
with what 
what do you know
about the multiverse 
i m sorry  stephen 
i hope you understand
