what
peter hey
mj they have nothing
to do with this sir
dont say anything
without a lawyer
i want a lawyer
ms joneswatson
jones i dont go by watson
ms jones why do you
want a lawyer if
if i have nothing to hide
exactly unless
im actually guilty of something
mmhm
im very aware of your tactics
and my rights
just answer my questions
ive seen your file
youre a smart young woman
with a bright future
ahead of her
why would you risk it all
by getting involved with
a vigilante like peter parker
so sorry to keep you waiting
can we get ned a snack
absolutely
hes been waiting
i got you
dude im so sorry about that
im not supposed
to say anything to you
not even a thing
i just have one question
when mj told you
peter was spiderman
whoa whoa whoa heh
whats up
ii knew way before mj did
i was spidermans
guy in the chair
i know about those
dude half my guys
are guys in the chair
exactly you would know
i literally helped him
find the vulture
i didnt know that
i helped him hack a suit once
and helped him get to space
so in spidermans
illegal vigilantism
you were his main accomplice
i would like to have my words
stricken from the record
with all due respect and
i mean that very insincerely
unless you have some real
specific charges to throw at us
legally you cant hold us here
you should definitely lawyer up
excuse me
child endangerments
a nasty rap
a boy was entrusted to you
and as his legal guardian
essentially his mother
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself
but you actually
encouraged it
who does that
i wanna see peter right now
stark
industries was caught in the web
of the spidermanmysterio
controversy today
when federal agents
opened an investigation
into missing stark technology
agents wanna know
exactly what was taken
at least they used
a good picture
what is happening

any of the charges
against you are gonna stick

my god mr murdock thank you
thank you matt
thats amazing
youre welcome

however mr hogan

the feds are investigating
that missing technology
i understand your loyalty
to mr stark and his legacy
but if you were involved
if i was
i advise securing a lawyer
i need a lawyer because im
i thought he was
you said theres no charge
i could say
under advisement of counsel
i refuse to answer
the question respectfully
because the answer
can incriminate me
its in goodfellas whats the
thing they say in goodfellas
i know thats what you think
calm down
lets hear what
he has to say matt
youre gonna need
a really good lawyer
you may have dodged
your legal troubles
but things will get much worse
there is still
the court of public opinion
murderer mysterio forever

wong try not to slip
we dont have
liability insurance

the sorcerer supreme

so peter to what
do i owe the pleasure
right im really sorry
to bother you sir
please we saved half
the universe together
think were beyond
you calling me sir
okay uh stephen
that feels weird
but ill allow it
when
when mysterio
revealed my identity
my entire life got screwed up
and i was wondering
i dont know
if this would actually work
but i was wondering if
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did
peter
we tampered with the stability
of spacetime
to resurrect countless lives
you wanna do it again now
because yours got messy
its not about me
i mean this is really hurting
a lot of people
my aunt may happy
my best friend
my girlfriend
their futures are ruined
just because they know me
and theyve done
nothing wrong
i am so sorry
but even if i wanted to
i dont have
the time stone anymore
thats right
im really sorry
if i wasted your time
no you didnt
just forget about it
he will hes very good
at forgetting things
wong youve actually
generated a good idea
what
the runes of kofkol
the runes of kofkol
its just a standard
spell of forgetting
wont turn back time
but people will forget
you were ever spiderman
seriously
no not seriously
that spell travels
the dark borders
between known
and unknown reality
its too dangerous
weve used it for a lot less
do you remember the full moon
party at kamartaj
no
exactly
come on wong
hasnt he been through enough
just leave me out of this
fine
fine
so what is this place
the sanctums built
at the intersection
of cosmic energy currents
we werent the first
to seek them out
some of these walls
are thousands of years old
and they shot an episode of
the equalizer here in the 80s
well i um
really appreciate you
doing this for me sir
dont mention it
and dont call me sir
right sorry
you ready
im ready
nice knowing you spiderman
wait excuse me
the entire worlds
about to forget
that peter parker
is spiderman
including me
everyone
uh cant some people

the spell works
and its very difficult
and dangerous
to change it midcasting
so my girlfriends

because you were spiderman
i dont know i really hope not
all right fine
everyone in the worlds
gonna forget youre spiderman
except your girlfriend

that ned knows
okay lets not change
the parameters of this spell
any more
while im casting it
okay im done
i swear im done im done
but my aunt may
should really know
peter stop tampering
with the spell
when she found out
it was really messy
i dont think
i could go through that again
so my aunt may

thank you happy
no im annoyed
no its a nickname
harold happy hogan
he used to work with tony stark
but then he was
could you just stop talking
basically everyone that knew
i was spiderman before
should still know
did it work
no
you changed my spell six times
five times
you changed my spell
you dont do that i told you
and that is why
that spell was out of control
if i hadnt shut it down
something catastrophic
could have happened
stephen listen i am so
call me sir
sorry sir
after everything
weve been through
somehow i always forget
youre just a kid

is not mysterio
its you trying to live
two different lives
and the longer you do that

spiderman
it started pulling in
everyone
who knows
peter parkers spiderman
from every universe
into this one
from every universe

i think its
better we dont engage
with them because
frankly
the multiverse
is a concept about which
we know frighteningly little
the multiverse is real
this shouldnt even be possible
i thought you stopped the spell
no i contained it
it would appear
a few of them squeaked through
after you left i detected
an otherworldly presence
i pursued it into the sewers
where i found that
slimy green son of a gun
spell as in magic
what is this
a birthday party
who is this clown
what is this madness
watch this
do you know a peter parker
whos spiderman
yes
is that him
no

okay heres what we gotta do
i dont know how many
visitors weve got
i saw another one
on the bridge
he was like a
flying green elf
he sounds jolly
start with him
i need you
to capture them
bring them here
while i figure out
how to get them back
before
they destroy
the fabric of reality
or worse wong finds out
uh doctor strange

second chance to get into mit

stay here for a bit
and try and fix
some of this damage
so they dont blame it
on me again

dead they both died
fighting spiderman
it was all over the news
green goblin impaled by
the glider you flew around on
and a couple of years later
you doc ock
drowned in the river
with your machine
thats nonsense
spiderman was trying
to stop my fusion reactor
so i stopped him
i had him by the throat
and then i
and then i was here
ah please
let me tell you something
i was whupping spidermans ass
hell tell you
and then he caused an overload
i was stuck in the grid
absorbing data
i was about to turn
into pure energy and then
and then uh
and then oh shit
i was about to die
max do you know do i die
oh great
you caught another one
no wait strange
hes not dangerous
its okay um
what is that
its an ancient relic
the macchina di kadavus
i trapped
your corrupted spell inside
and once i finish
the proper ritual
itll reverse the spell
and send these guys
back to their universes
and then what we perish
no no thanks
ill pass on that
let me out of here peter
strange we cant
send them back not yet
why
well some of these guys
are gonna die
parker its their fate
come on strange have a heart
in the grand calculus
of the multiverse
their sacrifice means infinitely
more than their lives
im sorry kid
if they die they die
peter
dont
dude what are you doing
peter you gotta go go go
okay
get out of here
this is why i never had kids
give me the box
no
whoa
oh my god im dead
youre not dead
youve just been separated
from your physical form
my physical what
how are you doing that
i have no idea
you should not
be able to do that
this feels amazing
thats one of the coolest
things thats happened to me
but dont ever do that again
wha hey get off of me
la la
tis the season
to be jolly
what is this place
the mirror dimension
where im in control
strange stop can we
please just talk about this
parker dont you realize
that in the multiverse
there are an infinite number
of people
who know peter parker
is spiderman
and if that spell gets loose
theyre all coming here
i know i get it but we cant
just send them home to die
its their fate
you cant change that
any more than you could
change who they are
but what if we could what if
we could change their fate
whoa oh what are you doing
im not giving you the whoa
whoa whoa
give me that back
wait a minute
is that an archimedean spiral
the mirror dimension
is just geometry
youre great at geometry
you can do geometry
square the radius
divide by pi
plot points along the curve
its over parker
ill come pick you up
when its done
hey strange
you know
whats cooler than magic
math
dont do this
ow
im sorry sir but
i have to try
what happened
i fought with strange and won
what
look i stole his ring thing
i was swinging through the city
and then i went through
this massive mirror thing
and then i was back in
where is he
hes trapped
but im not sure for how long
you could have left us to die
why didnt you
because thats not who he is
i think i can help you guys
if i can fix what happened
to you then when you go back
things will be different
and you might not die
fighting spiderman
what do you mean fix us
our technology is advanced
i can help you you know im
something of a scientist myself
octavius knows what i can do
fix you mean like a dog
i refuse
i cant promise
you guys anything
but at least this way you get
to go home and have a chance
a second chance
come on
isnt that worth trying
trust me peter
when you try to fix people
there are always consequences
i mean you dont have to come
i also didnt know
that you could talk
but if you stay here
youre gonna have to deal
with the wizard
ah so we go along or die
not much of a choice is it
i just wanna go home
well i myself
dont wanna be killed
especially by a guy dressed
like dungeons  dragons
so whats your plan
i have it all under control
what are we
gonna do about this thing
uh well we need to find
somewhere safe for it right
yeah sure you gotta take it
wait what
if something bad happens
you just push this
and then its all over
were not gonna leave you
you cant its dangerous
youve done enough
were in this together
i know were in this together
but i cant do this
if youre in danger
okay so for me mj

okay
alarm system deactivated
hey may
yeah
i feel kind of bad
using happys place like this
no no no hell get over it
new yorkers
oppose the renovation
oh sorry
so this is your plan peter hm
no lab no facilities
just performing miracles
in a condominium hm
what you gonna cook us
some cures
and some frozen burritos
in a microwave
i could go for a burrito
hes gonna kill us all
well lets hope not
youre up first doc
what
hey i told you
i dont need fixing
i dont need fixing
especially by a teenager
using scraps
from a bachelors junk drawer
nah nah nah
he got something back there
i can feel it
that weird energy
what the hell is that
its a fabricator
it can analyze design
construct basically anything
i thought that was
the tanning bed happy broke
look at that
hes gonna kill us all
whoa whats going on there
so the chip in
the back of docs neck
was designed to protect
his brain from the ai system
thats controlling
these tentacles
but if you look here
the chip is fried
so rather than him being
in control of the tentacles
the tentacles are now
in control of him
which i guess explains why
he is so miserable all the time
thirsty
well yes i am thirsty
fresh water or salt
you know
because youre an octopus
what
fresh water it is
look at this place
and all the possibilities
what this condo
yeah yeah the condo i love
the whole open floor plan no
no man
im talking about the world
i kind of like who i am here
and all that power back there
i could be so much more
so whyd you come along
i have a daughter
and i want to see her
but hes not gonna
send anyone home
till hes finished his little
science project back there
you trust him
i dont trust anyone
howd you end up
like that anyway
oh
the place where i worked at
they were experimenting
with electricity
created by living organisms
and then uh
i fell into
a vat of electric eels
youre kidding
i fell into a supercollider
damn
gotta be careful
where you fall
remarkable
the technology and you
when all this is over
if you need a job
and youre willing to commute
to another universe
it worked that totally worked
i got it i did it
uh will you send him up
here we go
sorry
hold on doc
oh will these humiliations
never cease
you keep your science fair
project away from me
itll work have faith
says the reckless fool who
turned himself into a monster
please stop moving your head
hold still

i just dont want you
to end up like like me
the night ben died
i hunted down the man
who i thought did it
i wanted him dead
i got what i wanted
it didnt make it better
it took me a long time
to learn to get through
that darkness
i wanna kill him
i wanna tear him apart
i can still hear
her voice in my head
even after she was hurt
she said to me
that we did the right thing
she told me
that with great power
comes great responsibility
wait what
how do you know that
uncle ben said it
the day he died
maybe she didnt die
for nothing peter

its been a few
weeks since the fiasco
on the statue of liberty
and spidermans cultists
continue to contend that
the vile vigilante is a hero
well if he were a hero
hed unmask himself
and tell us who he really is
because only a coward
conceals his identity
only a coward hides
his true intentions
rest assured
ladies and gentlemen
this reporter will uncover
those intentions
come hell or high water
hi my name is peter parker
you dont know me but i uh
hi my name is peter parker
and you dont know me but you
okay come on

my fellow engineer

oh okay
peter parker peter parker

mmhm
um
are you excited for mit
oh uh right yeah
uh yeah actually
i am excited which is weird
cause i dont really
get excited about things
i kind of expect disappointment
cause then youll never
actually be disappointed
right
uh
yeah right
i dont know it kind of
feels different
this time for some reason
right um
what i was
you okay
it doesnt really hurt anymore
is there anything else
no
thank you
no problem
ill uh see you around
howd you know her
through spiderman
you
same
i lost a good friend
a while back
felt like this
it hurts cause theyre gone
and then it hurts all over again
because you remember
what they stood for
and you wonder
is all that gone too
no its not gone
everyone that she helped
theyll keep it going
you really think so
i know it
take care of yourself okay
yeah nice to meet you
rent is due on the
first of the month dont be late
fourthreeedward
do you need an ems assist
negative central
were gonna need a car tow
three
thats the magic number
yes it is
its the magic number
somewhere in
this hiphop soul community
was born three
mase dove and me
and thats
the magic number
what does it all mean
difficult preaching
is posdnuos pleasure
pleasure and preaching
starts in the heart
something that stimulates
my music in my measure
measure in the music
raised in three parts
casually see
but dont do like the soul
cause seein and doin
are actions for monkeys
doin hiphop hustle
no rock n roll
unless your names brewster
cause brewsters a punk
parents let go cause
theres magic in the air
criticizing rap
shows youre out of order
stop look and listen
to the phrasin fred astaires
and dont get offended while
mase dosidos your daughter
a tricameral system
is now set
fly rhymes are stored
on a daisy production
it stands for da inner sound
yall and yall can bet
that the actions not a trick
but shonuff a function
everybody wants to be
a deejay
everybody wants
to be an emcee
but no more no less
and you dont have to guess
de la soul posse
consists of three
and thats the magic number
this here piece of the pie
is not dessert
but the course that we dine
and three out of
every darn time
the effect is mmmm when
a daisy grows in your mind
showing true position
this here piece is
kissin the part of the pie
thats missin
when that negative number
fills up your casualty
three
maybe you can subtract it
you can call it
your lucky partner
maybe you can call it
your adjective
but odd as it may be
without my one and two
where would there be
my three
mase pos and me
and thats the magic number
what does it all mean
focus is formed
by flaunts of the soul
souls who flaunt styles
gain praises by pounds
common are speakers
who honor the scroll
scroll written daily
creates a new sound
listeners listen
cause this here is wisdom
wisdom of a speaker
a dove and a plug
set aside a legal substance
to feed em
for now get em high
off this dialect drug
time is a factor
so its time to count
count not
the negative actions of one
speakers of soul
say its time to shout
three forms of soul
to a positive sum
dance to this fix
and flex every muscle
space can be filled
if you rise like my lumber
advance to the tune
but dont do the hustle
shake rattle roll
to my magic number
now you may
try to subtract it
but it just wont go away
three times one
what is it
one time three times one
what is it
three times one
what is it
three
thats a magic number
okay
okay i think i got this
youre saying that
this whole place here
its just tons of
superpeople
and he has been
saying it for hours
all right tell me again
im sorry im an idiot
there was a billionaire
he had a tin suit
and he could fly right
okay and there was
a really angry green man
hulk
hulk
and you thought lethal
protector was a shit name
yeah because it is
now tell me again
about your purple alien
that loves stones
cause ill tell you what man
aliens do not love stones
eddie dont start
they dont
know what aliens love
eating brains
because thats what they do
all right
señor he made
my family disappear
for five years
five years
thats a long time
maybe i
maybe i should go to new york
and speak to this
spiderman
eddie we are drunk
lets go skinnydip
i dont think
we should skinnydip
you have to pay the bill
what is happening no
no we just got here
no not again
and there he goes
without paying the bill
no tips nothing
dont cast that spell
its too dangerous
why
we tampered with
the stability of spacetime
the multiverse is a concept
about which we know
frighteningly little
your desecration of reality
will not go unpunished
it was the only way
but i never meant
for any of this to happen
wanda
well i knew sooner or later
youd show up
i made mistakes
and people were hurt
im not here to talk
about westview
then what are you here for
we need your help
with what
what do you know
about the multiverse
im sorry stephen
i hope you understand
