podcast  the 11th brick at stonewall 
because we all know a butch
lesbian or a trans woman of color
probably threw the first
brick at stonewall 
but it was a cis  white  gay
man who threw the 11th brick 
and today  as always  i will take you
on a journey throughout lgbtq  history 
and much more importantly  my own problems
and whatever i feel like talking about 
and this is a big day 
because  as of today  the 11th brick
is celebrating one million subscribers 
and in honor of all this exciting
news  i am taking your questions live 
first question 
hi  bobby  any chance for
more children s books 
oh  not at the
moment  but thank you 
as some of you know  i wrote
a series of children s books
to help parents teach kids about
gay history  which no one bought 
turns out a four year old didn t
want to hear a bedtime story
about martina navratilova 
hey  parents  thanks for teaching
your kids about santa claus 
a straight man
that doesn t exist 
and not martina navratilova 
a lesbian who does 
in other news  i
finally got the footage
from my audition to be part
of the next cast of queer eye 
and you can watch that
on the app right now 
  an8   oh  no 
  oh  my   
  an8 i m sorry  this is not
sad  it s just not sad 
  an8 you gave him a haircut
and a pair of pants 
  an8 i mean  he looks fine 
  an8   not great 
  next caller 
what happened to
that movie you wrote 
oh  yeah  the movie 
these big movie producers
came to me and said 
 we want you to write a
rom com about a gay couple 
something the whole
world would enjoy 
something a straight guy might even
like and watch with his girlfriend  
i said   something a straight guy
might like  like what exactly 
am i gonna be in the middle
of some high speed chase 
and then all of a sudden
fall in love with ice cube 
am i gonna get butt fucked by
jason momoa while we re both 
i don t know  worrying
about a volcano  
and he said   bobby  we just want
to make a movie that shows the world
gay and straight
relationships are the same 
love is love is love  
i said    love is love is love  
no  it s not  that s bullshit 
that is a lie we had to make up
to convince you idiots to
finally treat us fairly 
love is not love 
our relationships are different 
our sex lives are different  
and he said   bobby  we were
just trying to make a nice movie
about nice gay people  
and i said   well  there s
your first mistake 
because not all gay
people are nice  
and i got up and left 
anyway  it s totally fine 
i m not the right person
to write a rom com anyway 
why not 
um  i don t know 
i mean  i m 40 years old 
i ve never been in love 
i ve never even had a serious
relationship  which is fine 
you know  i love my life  i love
my freedom  i love my independence 
but   you know 
probably means i m not the right
person to write a love story 
in exciting news  i
remain very horny 
and tonight i am being honored
at the lgbtq  pride awards 
being in the nfl  i never
thought i could come out 
for years  i had to suffer
as a hot  ripped  gay person 
living my life in private 
but this last year
has really shown me
how amazing life can be when
you are finally publicly hot 
thank you 
and now  please welcome emmy and
tony award winner  kristin chenoweth 
good evening 
what an honor for me
to be here tonight 
on my head is a hat depicting
the stonewall riots 
where the queer
liberation movement began 
and now  the award for cis 
white  gay man of the year 
please welcome bobby leiber 
thank you 
oh  my goodness 
thank you  new york 
thank you  thank you 
meet khnumhotep and niankhkhnum 
the bert and ernie of ancient egypt 
many scholars believe
that they are the first recorded
same sex couple in history 
yet to this day 
there are historians who refuse to
believe that these men were lovers 
and insist that they
were brothers instead 
thus began 5 000 years
of queer love stories
erased from the history books 
no gay love stories to teach us about
love and how to love each other 
well  i m happy to say
this erasure ends today 
and i am thrilled to announce
i have accepted a position
as the executive director
of the first national
lgbtq  history museum 
right here in new york city 
thank you  new york  thank you 
thank you so much

thanks 
  an8 for me  the cold and
awkward grindr hookup
  an8 is often followed by a walk
around the city by myself 
anyone else do that 
  an8 it s weird  because you still
had this romantic encounter 
even though it was odd or unsatisfying 
and you don t even know the person 
you re still feeling this  kind of 
post sex warmth and wistfulness 
so i usually walk
around for a bit 
and i kind of coast on that warm
feeling as long as it lasts 
and between the weird sex with
strangers that you don t like
and conversations with friends you love
that you would never have sex with 
you know  you cobble together a
version of a romantic single life 
and it s good  you
know  it works 
it s a lot more than what a lot of
other people have in this world 
and you try to remember that 
as always  this podcast is
brought to you by career donkey 
hi  hi  i m sorry 
i know  i m sorry 
what s going on  what did i
miss  how are you guys  lucas 
well  our surrogate just hit three
months  and  not only that  but we are   
having triplets 
  oh  my god  congratulations  oh  my god

  thank you 
bye  marty 
  bye  y all 
  text us 
so what s happening  didn t
you guys have an announcement 
okay  so  i totally know this is
a little weird and unexpected 
but the reason we ve been
hanging around with marty so much
is that we are kind of 
dating him 
okay 
wait a second  wait  wait  wait 
what do you mean 
you re dating him 
i mean  together  like  as
a couple  we re seeing him 
i guess it s kind of like
a throuple situation 
hold on  so  wait  what
does that mean exactly 
like  are you guys just having
threesomes or something 
well  we hooked up  but then we started
spending a bunch of time together after 
it turns out we have
a lot in common 
it s more than just sex  we
genuinely like each other 
wait  wait  so  how long
has this been going on 
six months 
you re in a throuple for six
months  and you didn t tell me 
we didn t know it d

jointly fucking someone else 
oh  how wonderful 
it s a throuple 
we ll be fine  we really trust
each other enough to do this 
just be careful 
i know a lot of guys who ve done
this  and it s a slippery slope 
these things are fragile 
and  you know  we re men 
okay  men dating men 
love is not love  we are horny
and selfish and stupid  i am too 
someone called into my show the other
day and asked me why i m still single 
i said   you want to know why 
because i ve been gay my whole life  and
i don t trust these gay motherfuckers 
i support them  but
i don t trust them  
and are you happy

parents still live in the city 
no  my parents both
passed away  actually 
oh  i m sorry 
oh  yeah  thanks 
it wasn t recent 
my mom died when i was in college 
and my dad died ten years ago 
a bee  a bee  a bee  a bee 
whoa  whoa  stop swatting 
you re gonna kill it 
that s what i m trying
to do  it s on my neck 
bees are dying  don t you read 
yes  about gay stuff and movies 
  can you do something 
  yes  yes  yes  here  it s okay 
  you re touching the bee 
  i know  okay 
wow  thank you 
you re like a grown up
gay boy scout 
and i m like whatever ends
up happening to evan hansen 
let me see what s playing 
what s your favorite
movie of all time 
what s my favorite movie
of all time  i don t know 
why  what s your favorite movie 
the hangover 
the hangover is your
favorite movie of all time 
how many movies
have you seen  one 
it s a funny movie 
yeah  kinda 
and you remember one of the
first lines of that movie 
   paging dr  faggot   remember that 
  yes 
 paging dr  faggot  is
one of the first lines
of the highest grossing comedy of
2009  and no one talks about it  right 
and it wasn t that long ago  we re
just supposed to laugh it off 
it doesn t bother me  i m
not sensitive like that 
i think you just like
getting angry at things 
getting angry at things
is like your brand 
what  no  it s not  fuck you 
getting angry at things is
my brand  no  no  no  no 
you just don t like to complain because
that means your feelings were hurt 
and that means admitting you re
weak  and that s too vulnerable 
and as much as we go around
saying men should be vulnerable 
you and i both know
that is such bullshit 
because for a lot
of these gay guys 
sweetness and vulnerability
are wonderful and lovely 
but they can also be
a real boner killer 
you re very intense 
yes 
i was kidding  by the way 
  about what 
  the hangover  it s not my favorite movie 
no  you weren t 
yeah  i was  i just like
seeing you get riled up 
  i don t believe you 
  i was kidding 
hmm 
i don t like this 
okay  let s see what
we have here  mm mmm 
oh  the treasure inside is supposed
to be really good  actually 
what s that about 
it s about two closeted gay frontiersmen
in the california gold rush of 1849 
but really  it s about two straight actors
playing gay  trying to win an oscar 
i never tire of watching
two very straight actors
really transform themselves
into being sad and gay 
gay actors playing gay 
that s not even acting 
oh  i totally agree 
if they ever make a movie about my life 
they d better hire a straight actor 
i like to think of my life
story as just another way
for benedict cumberbatch
to really score 
okay  if we don t see this
movie  what are we gonna do 
i didn t say i didn t
want to see the movie 
  oh 
  i ll see the fucking movie 
i m dying to 
i d put it way above
call me by your name
but sort of below dallas buyers 
well  it got me in the end 
yeah  but why does it
always have to be so tragic 
i don t know  philadelphia 
milk  brokeback 
happy endings don t win oscars 
straight people love
seeing us miserable 
  mmm 
  wait  aaron shepard 
josh evans  holy shit 
  hey  man  bro  nice to see you 
  what is up  dude 
it s been for fucking ever 
aaron and i  we played
hockey in high school 
this is my fianc√©e  samantha 
  hey 
  hey  nice to meet you 
this is bobby 
  hey 
  hey 
we just saw the treasure inside 
it s about closeted gay frontiersmen 
oh  okay  nice

yeah  nice to meet you  bob 
nice to meet you guys 
that is crazy  i never run
into anybody from my hometown 
oh  yeah  bro  totally  bro 
just some dumb movie  bro 
i had the biggest crush
on him in high school 
yep  that tracks 
well  like the bearded lady in
the greatest showman  this is me 
oh 
the faux chicago cub 
yeah  his husband
just sent me that 
wow  they are extremely hot 
yeah  mike and doug  they re
these roided out meatheads 
they re not the brightest 
but they re sweet 
do you wanna go over there 
wait  are you ditching me again
to go fuck the baseball
cosplayer and his husband 
no  i m not ditching
you  i m inviting you 
why don t you just
come upstairs 
uh  i don t really do the whole
relationship thing very well 
relationship 
when did i say i wanted to be
in a relationship with you 
we literally hung out one day 
yeah  but if i go upstairs  it
becomes like a whole thing and 
whatever  we should just go
over there  it ll be fun 
i m not gonna go  but you should
go  can i ask you one thing though 
why did you text me if
you didn t wanna hook up 
i m not angry  i m
just honestly curious 
i didn t say i
didn t wanna    i   
i guess i had fun talking
to you at the club 
and i wanted to say 
 hey  what s up  
 hey  what s up   so
basically you texted me
when you were feeling hungover
and lonely in that moment 
but you re not actually into me 
but you went on the date anyway 
why are gay guys so weird 
actually  you know 
we re not weird 
we re just constantly catering
to our own whims and needs 
which can change on a dime 
but we never even think about
the emotional consequences
of the other person 
anyway  it s been a blast
catering to your whims 
and  honestly  i can t
really say anything about it
because i do the same thing
to people all the time  so 
  fun day 
  fun day 
  and  um 
  yeah 
  have fun with those guys

report  it s about freddie mercury 
he s obsessed with
bohemian rhapsody 
oh  my god  i love this 
and like that movie  does your report take
a story about one of the great gay icons
and make it about that one time
he maybe had sex with a woman 
  i thought freddie mercury was bi 
  he had a wife 
yeah  well  so did
jesus  and he was gay 
this is excellent and an
improvement on the film  good job 
what are those gifs
from the hangover 
nothing  this guy i went out
with won t stop texting me 
a guy 
really  like a grindr guy 
no  shockingly  i actually
met this one in real life 
bobby  that s fantastic  you
think you re gonna see him again 
no  he told me he prefers
group sex to one on one
because one on one is too intense
and makes it a whole thing 
we went on one date  and we
had sex with three people 
gay relationships these
days are like a clown car 
oh  there s another one  oh 
look  another one  another one 
it s ridiculous  plus  i
don t think i m his type 
  how do you know 
  because i know 
he told me he likes country music  and
his favorite singer is garth brooks 
what kind of gay man says his
favorite singer is garth brooks 
that scares me 
plus  i see the guys he likes 
they all look exactly like him 
they re all these big  hot 
straight acting dudes  it s just not me 
  is he a top or bottom 
  what does that have to do with anything 
maybe you re both bottoms 
and that s the problem 
i m not always
the bottom  edgar 
bottom dance 
  yeah 
  ooh  bottom dance 
ooh ooh  uh uh uh 
oh  my god 
gay sex was more fun
when straight people were
uncomfortable with it 
fucking schitt s creek 
maybe we should stop talking about
anal sex in front of your children 
  oh  please  it s a natural part of life 
  nah 
bobby  ask him out again 
you never like anyone 
he is so handsome 
  so are you 
  dude  you re a hottie 
he is on another level 
he s like gay tom brady 
when i m with him  i feel
like friggin  elphaba 
i bet he s as intimidated by you
  as you are by him 
  oh  yeah 
i m telling you  he s
scared of being vulnerable 
gay guys from your generation still have
all these pent up masculinity issues 
you all need to get
over it already 
half the kids in brian s
class are nonbinary 
well  it s not fair  tina  we
had aids  and they had glee 
but there is a work thing i was thinking
of maybe inviting him to  maybe 
what  a work thing  with lots
of celebrities and fancy people 
now  are you gonna
peacock to impress him 
no  it s just a big
fundraiser for the museum 
and i need to bring someone 
are you gonna be onstage 
no  i am not going to
be  onstage   okay 
i am not some sort of
narcissistic sociopath 
thank you  doja cat 
everyone  there are rock paintings in
zimbabwe which depict homosexuality
that date back to
the year 2 000 bce 
if only the men on those paintings
had lived another 4 000 years
to see a character come out on
it s always sunny in philadelphia 
who did your chin 
oh  no  it s real 
yeah  mine too 
please continue
to give generously
so the museum can tell all the stories
in between that have never been told 
thank you very much  good night 
yeah  all right 
hey  i m so sorry i left you
alone  things got a little crazy 
no  hey  dude  you were awesome 
i mean  i could never do that 
speak in front of a bunch
of people like that 
you move in some pretty
fancy circles  i had no idea 
trust me  it s not
always this glamorous 
  bobby  that was amazing  as always 
  oh  thank you  charles 
  congrats on everything 
  thank you so much  thank you for coming 
  thank you 
  great speech  bobby 
hi  thank you so much 
hey  do you wanna see the museum 
i can give you a private tour 
oh  sure  i don t wanna drag
you away from all this though 
  oh  no  it s fine  here  that way 
  yeah  okay 
  an8 this is the legends pavilion 
unsung heroes from lgbtq  history 
marsha p  johnson
and sylvia rivera 
usually stonewall is the only thing
straight people know about queer history 
truthfully  no one really knows who
threw the first bricks at stonewall 
but it was trans women of
color like marsha and sylvia
who drove the earliest days of
the queer liberation movement 
so what do you think  it s
pretty incredible  right 
yeah  i mean  it s
really impressive 
but 
but it s kinda depressing 
it s depressing  it
made you depressed 
it s aids and nazis
and homophobia 
all of it s just   
it s kind of a downer 
okay  well  what were you
expecting  a night at the museum 
honestly  my family
loves that movie 
  oh  okay 
  oh  what if you did something like that 
where the things  they come
alive  and they talk at you 
 where the things come
alive  and they talk at you  
  yeah 
  like  what exactly 
oh  oh  what if we had a bust
of eleanor roosevelt  right 
  yeah 
  and you get really close 
and then all of a sudden  you
realize that s not eleanor roosevelt 
  it s amy schumer 
  oh 
no  it s a museum  it s
not supposed to be fun 
bobby  we ve got debra
messing s agent on the zoom 
it s urgent 
debra s worried that she s on
the verge of being canceled 
she said in an interview that
she was the viola davis of tufts 
and people are mad 
her agent is saying that she may give
a very big donation to the museum
to save face 
who s debra messing 
from will   grace  oh  my god 
okay  wait  this is amazing 
stay here  i ll be
back in five minutes 
  sure  yep 
  okay 
aaron 
aaron 
what the fuck 
say hi to your brother 
  sup 
  sup 
jason s staying here while
he figures out where to live 
never get divorced  aaron 
never get married 
okay  mom  i m sorry  i m at work 
so i should probably get going 
oh  i almost forgot to tell you 
do you remember josh evans 
yeah  josh evans
from high school 
i actually ran into him and his
fianc√©e on the street the other day 
well  they just broke up 
and you wanna know why 
because he s gay 
josh ev    no 
i m definitely embarrassed about
how long this has taken me 
but i m told people do
this in their own time 
i ve been empowered by my
hero  colton underwood 
to say that  as it turns out 
i m gay 
  an8 and like this post if you
like that i m gay  peace 
holy shit 
so we started going back
and forth for a while 
and then at the end  i was just like 
 why don t you call the album lemonade  
bobby  when you re ready 
  what 
  when you re ready 
sorry 
okay  people wonder if america is
ready for its first gay president 
i say  we already had one 
for the final wing 
please consider 
the lincoln letters  a
gay american love story 
for years  historians have
speculated about lincoln s sexuality 
he shared a bed and exchanged intimate
letters with multiple men over the years 
including joshua speed
and david derickson 
okay  i m stopping you 
bobby  it won t work  you
can t say lincoln was gay 
why 
there s no way to confirm those
were sexual relationships 
there s no evidence of love 
of course there s no
evidence of love  robert 
we weren t allowed to exist  how
would we have enough evidence 
lincoln was married to a
woman and had four children 
he was not gay  bobby 
he might have been bi 
i am telling you 
we have let the world erase gay love
stories since the beginning of time 
this is our chance to reject
the shame and restore the truth 
and if we don t do this 
we re letting them win 
we re letting the
heterosexual terrorists win 
  the heterosexual terrorists 
  that s right 
there are also gay terrorists 
and there are bi terrorists  okay 
there are many bisexual terrorists 
okay  there are
trans terrorists too 
caitlyn jenner 
enough  people 
let s vote on it 
okay 
looks like we have two votes for
the great bisexuals of the world 
thank you  someone 
and three votes for the
lincoln letters  lincoln wins 
yes  thank you  thank you 
debra messing is
in the building 
yes  my girl

your job is really intense 
yes  and i hate it 
it s fucking stressful and depressing
and so fucking boring  i   
i fucking hate it 
i m sorry 
was there something
else you wanted to do 
bobby  i need to
tell you something 
when i was younger 
  what happened 
  i   
you can tell me 
when i was younger  i wanted
to make little chocolates 
you wanted to make 
little chocolates 
yes  i used to tell my parents that i
was going to the arcade at the mall 
but i would sneak off to godiva 
i just loved how all the
chocolates were wrapped 
and i thought about how i
would design my own chocolates 
how each little chocolate has its
own specific  unique design on it 
and that little design tells you
what they re gonna taste like 
so  i would draw my own
chocolates in a notepad 
it s all i thought about 
tiny little pretty chocolates 
that s good 
what was i gonna do with that 
though  what was i gonna be 
a chocolatier 
bobby  i wasn t gonna be
a fucking chocolatier 
i don t know  why not 
it seemed kinda faggy 
oh  my god  aaron 
faggy 
it s not faggy to spend your life
making pretty little chocolates 
  bobby 
  okay  fine  but so what 
so you re a big fag 
so am i  it s great 
did you not realize
that a few minutes ago
when you were sticking your
enormous penis into my tiny anus 
okay  yeah  it s kind of
clich√©  don t you think 
i d rather be a clich√©
than be miserable 
well  my 15 year old brain in
1995  that is all i thought about 
that was right around the time
that my brother caught me 
hooking up with a guy 
no  no  i was making
little chocolates 
oh 
i lied  and i said that i was 
making chocolates for this girl
that i had a crush on at school 
i m sorry  this is the
cutest thing i ve ever heard 
i guess you just have
this big  exciting life 
i just didn t want you to think
that i was some boring schlub 
i don t think you re boring 
your friend said i was boring 
oh  my god  you
were mad about that 
i was joking  i m sorry 
but i don t understand 
you don t have to be stuck in
that miserable office all day 
you could be out in the world  i
don t know  making fudge  you know 
you re like a keebler elf
with internalized homophobia 
you have to do this  you
have to become a chocolatier 
oh  bobby 
you have to become a
chocolatier  i m telling you 
you make that sound so easy 
well  no  it s not easy 
nothing s easy 
my god  you know what i
have to do this weekend 
i have to drag my concave chest up to
provincetown and beg donors for money 
i need five million dollars
or else the museum can t open 
and it s pride up there 
so the museum has to have a float in
the parade  and that s a whole thing 
i m telling you  it is not
easy  it is never easy 
but it s worth it 
hey  maybe i can come 
to where 
provincetown

i heard you singing
in the shower 
well  that s mortifying 
wait  so you re asking this guy to

you can t scare these people
off by seeming too needy 
kind of like with you 
who s lawrence grape 
larry grape  biggest gay
tv producer on the planet 
he s made all this groundbreaking
queer content  he s major 
mr  grape  i m thinking the final
wing should be about lincoln 
love that  love lincoln 
very few people know this 
but our most popular president
was also our first gay president 
sorry  this is a lincoln museum 
is this a lincoln museum  sir 
this is actually an
lgbtq history museum 
it s the first of its kind on a
national level  we actually   
that fucking bush 
come on 
my neighbors planted that
bush  and it blocks my view 
can you believe that 
let s go take care of this 
  again with this 
  this is my property  maurice 
this is a shared borderline 
this is a fucking disaster 
he won t even listen to me 
he s too busy getting his
rottweiler ready for pride 
okay  from my
experience at my job 
weird rich people just
want to be listened to 
ask him what he s interested in 
but i don t care what he s interested
in  i m here to pitch him my idea 
well  then pretend like you re
interested  just do a listening face 
  do a listening face 
  yeah 
  mmm  yeah 
  i can t 
yes  come on  go

  see you there  love you 
  i love you too 
all right  listening 
i ll try it  i ll try it 
sorry  i have to
get going  boys 
oh  mr  grape  let
me ask you something 
um  what would you like
to see in the museum 
a haunted house of gay trauma 
a haunted house of gay trauma 
yeah  it s a cart on a
track  and there s   
i m sorry  this is a ride 
yeah  it s a fucking ride  so
you think a ride is too much 
um  no  no 
no  no  no  no  it s
perfect  please  keep going 
okay  we find ourselves
in an intimate little bar
with some young 
hot animatronic men 
the men turn to dance with
each other when suddenly  boom 
a cop car smashes
through the wall 
police storm out of the cars 
there s sirens and batons
and voices screaming 
and suddenly  the car takes
off like a roller coaster 
and there s blood everywhere 
and a monster with reagan s face on it
is chasing you down the hallway saying 
 shining city on a hill 
shining city on a hill  
and then we shoot
out into the light 
and it ends on something happy 
like lil nas x working
out with pink dumbbells 
wow 
a gay trauma coaster 
i mean  it s    it s
very provocative 
i just don t think we can afford
that sort of thing  unfortunately 
right  well  okay  it was
so lovely meeting you g   
mr  grape  mr  grape 
  i m not a creative guy  i m a money guy 
  no  no  no  no 
no  no 
i can tell you  to
accomplish what you want 
we need more than just
a little donation 
no  aaron   
we need five million dollars 
and you won t just get
the gay trauma coaster 
you get the lincoln
exhibit  you get all of it 
you rewrite history for
an entire lgbtq community 
you re a storyteller  lawrence 
and this is the ultimate story 
you already pushed the
museum opening back twice 
is it really happening 
yes  it s definitely happening  i promise 
my entire life has led up to this 
right  well  five million dollars is
nothing to rewrite history  i m in 
  wait  really 
  yes  yes 
oh  my god 
mr  grape  thank you 
of course  congratulations

please leave 
aaron  oh  my god 
you re a genius   you re a storyteller  
where did that even come from 
i told you i m good at

i don t know  bye 
bobby 
you re gorgeous 
what  you are 
i still can t believe what
you did with lawrence today 
that was amazing 
five million dollars 
it s not that big a deal 
it is a huge deal 
are you kidding me 
i always have to do everything for myself 
no one ever does shit like that for me 
you know  what you did for
me  you could do for yourself 
open a chocolate
shop  i don t know 
i m not opening
a chocolate shop 
i m not as confident as you 
oh  please  i m
not that confident 
you are the most confident
person i know  like  to a fault 
it s actually   
it s kind of scary 
trust me  it s all an act 
confidence is just a choice you
make  it s a decision like any other 
usually born out of necessity 
you think i have a
good singing voice now 
you should have heard me when
i was a kid  i was even better 
had american idol existed then 
i would ve been the gay guy with an
amazing voice who comes in second 
and then let s see 
then i went to college 
and my musical theater teacher 
he told me that i had a  gay
walk  and a  flamboyant quality 
which would  limit my options  
and then for grad school 
i went to one of the best
journalism schools in the country 
and my teacher there  this old  closeted
queen who was married to a woman 
pulled me aside and thought
he was doing me a favor
when he told me that i
should stick to writing
because my voice sounded too
gay to do the news on tv 
true story 
and then i did stick to writing
and my gay history books 
every single publisher 
every single one 
told me there wasn t enough
of an audience for it 
i was always too gay 
or i was too niche 
or  you know  i made
people uncomfortable 
even my dad  who was so
wonderful and supportive 
i remember him saying 
 you know  not everyone wants to
hear this gay stuff all the time  
but what was i supposed to do 
i mean  i m a writer 
i wanted to write about my
life  my friends  my world 
and i m telling you  enough
people tell you things like that 
no matter how confident you are 
when you re alone at night 
you start to think that
maybe they re right 
so 
i just put my head down 
and i just worked really hard 
and i just hoped that  somehow 
all these other
people were wrong 
and they were 
and they were 
i mean 
i spent years watching a wave of
mediocre straight men passing me by 
men with half the talent 
who worked half as hard 
who didn t care as much as i did 
and they got twice as far  always 
i mean  that s an
old story  but 
and  you know  the
world caught up with us 
didn t catch up fast enough 
didn t catch up fast enough
for my parents to see all these
great things happen for me 
right 
didn t catch up fast
enough for a lot of people 
that s the truth 
let me tell you 
confidence is just knowing you re the
only person left you can count on 
that s all that is 
that s all 
want another beer 
sure 
sorry  that was a lot 
did that weird you out 
i love this song 
that is a weird dance 
excuse me  at least i dance 
i can dance

dance  literally no one has 
  really 
  no 
  wanna see me dance 
  yes 
uh oh

and mrs  shepard  these are
the first holiday windows
to ever feature a
sex positive tiny tim 
and it s so important 
we don t get queer characters in
the stories that we read as kids 
there s no gay cinderella 
there s no lesbian rapunzel 
there s no nonbinary
ebenezer scrooge 
bobby  i think they get it 
guys  we ve gotta go

ray edible tinsel 
josh  evans 
hey  fellas  how s hallheart
village treating ya 
hey 
did you see the gay movie that
they did  it was kinda dope 
yeah  for years they ignored us  then
their audience got 10  less homophobic 
so they decided we re a new
demographic they can sell shit to 
i mean  look at these movies 
  an8 have yourself a heteronormative
little christmas 
  an8 miracle on 34th street
but with one gay guy 
  an8 home alone but with sarah
paulson  i mean  it s absurd 
  josh 
  hey 
  merry christmas 
  hey  man 
come get skates 
i want to see you and aaron back
out on the ice for old time s sake 
bobby  josh and aaron played
hockey together in high school 
oh  i know 
  come on 
  hey  man  what s going on  how you doing 
dude  what is your problem 
what 
could you just maybe
tone it down a notch 
i m sorry  i don t understand 
we ve been with my
parents for two hours 
and you ve already talked about
transgender mannequins  hiv prevention 
and you pointed out the
route to the 1976 dyke march 
they re having fun  they re
totally fine  what is your problem 
i m nervous  okay  i ve never
introduced them to anybody 
i just don t want them
to get weirded out 
i want them to have
a chill  normal time 
so now i m not normal 
bobby  you know what i mean 
i m just being myself 
okay  but maybe you could just be a
little less yourself for three hours 
i want them to like you 
oh  yeah  no  sure 
of course  yeah  i ll just   
i ll just be quiet 
okay  thank you 
bobby  oh  my god  hi 
hi 
jesus christ 
we have to go anyway  we
have a dinner reservation 
where s dinner again 
hey  dad  how are the
polar bears doing 
that s the team josh
and i used to play on 
they haven t won all year 
i told josh they need
you boys to come back 
bobby  you seem quiet tonight 
is everything all right 
oh  yeah  i m
totally fine  yeah 
you know  i m sorry if
i spoke too much today 
i just    i think i got nervous 
this is actually more
like how i usually am 
i m very quiet  very quiet
and just weirdly normal 
well  thanks again for
planning such a lovely day 
oh  you re so
welcome  mrs  shepard 
you sound like one of my
students  call me anne 
okay  i will 
mom s been a second grade
teacher for almost 40 years now 
oh  my god  that s amazing  we need
good teachers  now more than ever 
thank you  i agree 
and aaron says you re working
at an american history museum 
yes  yes  it is 
it s an american history museum 
mm hmm 
well  it s actually an
lgbtq history museum 
it s the first major queer
history museum in america 
do you teach your
students any gay history 
 cause i know in a few states 
they re finally starting to do it 
well  i teach
second grade  so no 
oh  right  no  i
understand  yeah 
out of curiosity  why not 
well 
i just think they re a
little young for that 
of course  yeah  no 
i understand that 
  i don t think so though 
  bobby 
no  no  no  i m just saying 
if i may disagree respectfully 
that s actually the best time to
teach them  when they re young 
you know  that way they develop
an appreciation for queer people
before they all start bullying each other
or hating themselves if they re gay 
maybe you re right 
feels a little young though 
right 
totally  i get it 
  i will drop it  agree to disagree 
  yeah 
  cheers to that 
  yes 
so when are you
guys heading home   
it s not really that young
though  it s not that young 
bobby  can you please drop it 
no  i can t  because we re talking
about gay kids here  and it s important 
one of the things that saved me
is that my parents exposed me
to gay stories when i was a kid 
when i was 12 years
old    this is true   
my parents took me to see a broadway
play called love and compassion 
it was about a group of gay men spending
the summer together in provincetown 
and all of a sudden
the curtain goes up 
and there are seven completely
naked gay men on stage 
and there i am  sitting between
my mom and dad at age 12 
looking at seven soft penises 
shit 
and all of a sudden  two of
the guys start making out 
and then one of them starts
talking dirty  you know 
and i remember this so vividly 
there was a sex scene and
one of the guys is like 
 pound my prostate  pound my prostate  
you know   milk me  milk me  
and i didn t even know what
that was  i mean  now i do 
but  you know  it
was incredible 
you know  to know that i could
sit there  between my mom and dad 
looking at seven penises 
seven penises  anne  i was 12 
and to know that they were okay with that 
i mean  that had a profound effect on me 
all i m saying is  we need to remove
the stigma from that type of thing 
so that gay kids can feel good about
themselves  that s all i m saying 
i mean  look at aaron and
how much he hates his life 
  bobby 
  all i m saying
is there s a direct correlation between
how unhappy you are with your life
and what you weren t taught
about your potential as a child 
bobby  stop talking 
seriously  enough 
i will kill you 
aaron  you hate your life 
your brother s a
real chatterbox 
hey  are you mad 
me  no  i m great 
josh just texted me  i m
gonna meet him at that bar 
i think we should
go home and talk 
really  you want to talk more 
i think it s better
than partying with josh 
the self loathing meathead
who took 40 years to come out 
not everybody s you  bobby 
okay  but 40 years  j r r  tolkien
took less time with his journey 
god  you are fucking relentless 
 aaron hates his life  
god 
hey 
hey 
fuck 
  okay  okay  okay  okay 
  big man 
dude  no 
hey  just kiss me 
aaron 
hey  bob 
shit  bobby  we were
just playing around 
you were just playing around 
what the fuck is wrong with you 
bobby  bobby 
  josh  leave 
  i m sorry 
  get the fuck out of here 
  bobby  calm down 
oh  my god  i knew
it  i fucking knew it 
just say it  can you
please just say it 
finally  just fucking say
it  because i already know 
  you re not attracted to me 
  what 
i see the guys you look at 
at the gym and the club 
everywhere  everywhere we go 
okay  bobby   
go be with him if
that s what you want 
but i will not let you drag
me into this any further 
and i will not let you break my
heart  i am too smart for that 
bobby  why did you say that shit
about me in front of my parents 
i begged you not to embarrass me 
but you couldn t help yourself 
what is wrong with you 
what is wrong with me 
 tone it down  bobby 
be quiet  bobby 
can t you be a little
bit less of yourself 
just for a few hours  
you don t think i
know what that means 
you don t think i know
what that s code for 
you don t think i ve been hearing
that my whole fucking life 
that s what you think about me 
i m not apologizing for myself 
i will leave that to you 
hey  question for you

proudly presents
our first polyamorous
holiday film 
a holly  poly christmas 
look  it s snowing 
  it s snowing on
all seven of us 
oh  man 
guys 
hey 
hey 
can we talk 
okay 
so what s up 
bobby  i am so sorry i told
you not to be yourself 
i know i fucked up  but
this is new for me too 
and when you blew up in front
of my parents  honestly  it   
it felt like you were
doing it on purpose 
i was 
and i m sorry 
i shouldn t have handled
it like that  you re right 
i m sorry 
but  aaron 
that doesn t change the fact that
you like a certain type of guy 
and that isn t me 
and that s okay 
you re right 
i always pictured
myself with a guy   
  like josh 
  yeah  a guy like josh 
yeah  he s hot 
yes  he s simple 
conventional  basic as hell 
and not somebody that
actually makes me happy 
bobby  you are so
different from me 
you re not afraid to take up space
in the world  you challenge me 
which at first 
it freaked me out
because who the fuck wants to
be challenged all the time  but 
but i love it 
you re what s been missing 
i know i fucked up  but
please give me another chance 
i miss you so much 
i miss you too 
a lot 
i didn t realize until
after we broke up
there were actually a couple
of months there where i was 
what do they call it 
in a good mood 
but i can t 
my whole life  i have prided
myself on being self aware
and self reliant
and self possessed 
and it didn t matter 
it didn t matter
because  at the end of the day 
i just ended up in the street
looking at you and
looking at josh
and thinking   i m
not enough for him  
i know  and i feel awful 
but do not throw this away
because of one mistake 
what do you want me to do 
  say you ll give me another chance 
  i can t do that 
why not 
 cause i don t trust you 
i ve been alone so
long  who knows 
maybe that s the only
way i know how to be 
i don t know 
i m going 
it s good 
hey 
if you don t trust
me  that s fine 
but if for some reason  underneath
all that strength and confidence 
you still don t trust that
you are lovable enough 
i m living proof 
that you re wrong 
first of all  thank you
all for letting me do this 
i really appreciate it 
look  i know i ve been a very
angry  judgmental person  obviously 
and sometimes anger can be
good  i know you all know that
because for years  it was the
fuel we all needed to keep going 
it wasn t that long ago that the
straight gatekeepers of the world
didn t allow for all of us to
really succeed in a big way 
oh  my god  do you guys
remember straight people 
yeah  they had a nice run 
look  bobby  i m a
black trans woman 
and i don t need you to come
here and lecture me about anger 
but i get it 
i am brimming with anger 
and if i were to let
just an ounce of it out 
i would probably explode
and kill every one of you 
but  bobby  i want
you to know something 
i hear you 
and i forgive you 
you do 
yes 
look  this is the only community
i ve ever loved being a part of 
and we fight like crazy 
and we always have 
but you re my people 
and i am so sorry that i was
so rude and spoke down to you 
i should ve shown you
much more respect 
there is truly no group of people on
earth that i love and respect more 
well  i am not going to
lie  i am still angry 
but i insist on progress 
not just for our lgbtq heroes 
but for our lgbtq assholes 
like you 
thank you  robert 
the live of this
apology has 40k viewers 
you re posting this 
can you please   
no  okay  yeah  no  you
should definitely post this 
everything should   
everything should be posted  and
thank you for teaching me that 
hey  i ve decided to quit 
  i just quit too 
  you did 
i do this kamala harris impression
online  and it s really taking off

whatever you re doing

  mm hmm 
hey  bobby  i wanted you to be
the first person to see this 
this is aaron shepard s chocolate
factory  i made these little chocolates 
i also made some special treats
to celebrate the opening
of the lgbtq  museum 
these are harvey milk duds 
and instead of a heart shaped
valentine s day box
filled with chocolates 
we have a pink  silence equals death 
triangle filled with chocolates 
and a tribute to my favorite
gay television character 
this is 
a  tirami susan  from friends 
of course aaron likes friends 
of course  all the
profits go to the museum

what do you want me to say 
how do you remove their heads 
what about   hey  bro

i m crashing here because i m
in the middle of a divorce 
and you haven t asked
me about it once 
i m sorry 
so how s the divorce 
  i don t wanna talk about it 
  okay 
so 
what happened to you 
okay  you remember at christmas
when mom and dad came 
i asked bobby to   
i asked him to tone it down 
i know  i know  i
fucked up  i panicked 
did you try to get him back 
yes  i mean  bobby is the best  but
he is a stubborn son of a bitch 
and do you love this
stubborn little bitch 
whatever  it s over 
bobby s strong  he
doesn t need me 
he doesn t need anyone 
hey  guys  it s your girl  tamara 
we re opening the lgbt museum tonight 
tonight is our grand opening  and
we re gonna have a wonderful time 
yeah  what s up 
what s up 
hi  i m leonardo da vinci 
i changed the world with my work as
an inventor  scientist and artist 
but most importantly 
i may have been bi 
arrivederci 
congrats  you ve made it to
the obama administration 
but what s that
around the corner 
okay  seriously  this
place is incredible 
are you happy 
i don t know  it s
weird  you know 
this place was my
dream  and it happened 
why can t i answer
your question 
  okay  can i just say one thing 
  yes 
i know that what
he did was wrong 
but you didn t have to
argue with his parents 
i did though 
plus  i apologized 
and he apologized too 
i just don t know
if i can trust him 
he fucked up  people fuck up 
is there no part of you that
wants to give him a second chance 
you know what it is 
i just don t want to want
someone else this much 
but you do 
it doesn t make you look
weak to love someone 
vulnerability is
not a boner killer 
i know you 
i know that you ve had a million reasons
to keep your guard up all these years 
but there are people out there
worth letting your guard down for 
were you happier with
him or without him 
that s all that really matters 
can i tell you something extremely
embarrassing that i would only tell you 
yes 
i wrote a song about him 
i know  that s the only time i m gonna
talk about it  we re not talking about it 
i didn t send it  and
i m not sending it 
okay  fine 
i ve just never seen
you that happy  is all 
and i love seeing it

  it s time for the toast 
  okay  great 
okay 
one of the hardest parts of
putting the museum together
was figuring out what the
final exhibit would be 
the message we d leave
people with about who we are 
but the truth is we
are not one thing 
we are not a monolithic group 
we are some of the smartest and most
self reliant people you will ever meet 
and we are so stupid 
and we are a total mess 
and we are great 
we ve been around since the
beginning of time  of course 
and yet it still feels like
we re at the very beginning
of being able to
tell our own stories 
in many ways  i think we re still
getting to know each other  really 
now  i m just a boring
old cis white gay 
but 
 one thing i have learned from my
trans and bi and nonbinary family
is that happiness for all of us comes from
staying fluid  staying open to change 
open to being more than just
who you thought you were
or more than what other
people assume you are 
so this is a toast to all of us 
we ve come a long way 
and there are a lot of people who deserved
to live long enough to be here tonight 
and we are here 
and they are not 
and we are very lucky 
we are very lucky 
i have no complaints 
hey 
hey 
um 
sorry  um   
just  um    one more
thing  sorry  hold on 
i m gonna do it  let s
do it  let s do it 
what s going on 
hi 
so  um 
this is a little special
something i wrote for tonight 
and i didn t think i would
actually have a reason to sing it 
and i haven t sung in front of people
in a very long time  so forgive me 
but tonight is about love
and we ve seen a lot
of tortured gay cowboys
played by a lot of straight
actors over the years 
so  this is a love song from
one gay cowboy to another
inspired by everyone s
favorite lgbtq  icon 
garth brooks 
bobby  i just have
to tell you

thought i d say this
