podcast the 11th brick at stonewall
because we all know a butch
lesbian or a trans woman of color
probably threw the first
brick at stonewall
but it was a cis white gay
man who threw the 11th brick
and today as always i will take you
on a journey throughout lgbtq history
and much more importantly my own problems
and whatever i feel like talking about
and this is a big day
because as of today the 11th brick
is celebrating one million subscribers
and in honor of all this exciting
news i am taking your questions live
first question
hi bobby any chance for
more childrens books
oh not at the
moment but thank you
as some of you know i wrote
a series of childrens books
to help parents teach kids about
gay history which no one bought
turns out a fouryearold didnt
want to hear a bedtime story
about martina navratilova
hey parents thanks for teaching
your kids about santa claus
a straight man
that doesnt exist
and not martina navratilova
a lesbian who does
in other news i
finally got the footage
from my audition to be part
of the next cast of queer eye
and you can watch that
on the app right now
an8 oh no
oh my
an8im sorry this is not
sad its just not sad
an8you gave him a haircut
and a pair of pants
an8i mean he looks fine
an8 not great
next caller
what happened to
that movie you wrote
oh yeah the movie
these big movie producers
came to me and said
we want you to write a
romcom about a gay couple
something the whole
world would enjoy
something a straight guy might even
like and watch with his girlfriend
i said something a straight guy
might like like what exactly
am i gonna be in the middle
of some highspeed chase
and then all of a sudden
fall in love with ice cube
am i gonna get buttfucked by
jason momoa while were both
i dont know worrying
about a volcano
and he said bobby we just want
to make a movie that shows the world
gay and straight
relationships are the same
love is love is love
i said love is love is love
no its not thats bullshit
that is a lie we had to make up
to convince you idiots to
finally treat us fairly
love is not love
our relationships are different
our sex lives are different
and he said bobby we were
just trying to make a nice movie
about nice gay people
and i said well theres
your first mistake
because not all gay
people are nice
and i got up and left
anyway its totally fine
im not the right person
to write a romcom anyway
why not
um i dont know
i mean im 40 years old
ive never been in love
ive never even had a serious
relationship which is fine
you know i love my life i love
my freedom i love my independence
but you know
probably means im not the right
person to write a love story
in exciting news i
remain very horny
and tonight i am being honored
at the lgbtq pride awards
being in the nfl i never
thought i could come out
for years i had to suffer
as a hot ripped gay person
living my life in private
but this last year
has really shown me
how amazing life can be when
you are finally publicly hot
thank you
and now please welcome emmy and
tony award winner kristin chenoweth
good evening
what an honor for me
to be here tonight
on my head is a hat depicting
the stonewall riots
where the queer
liberation movement began
and now the award for cis
white gay man of the year
please welcome bobby leiber
thank you
oh my goodness
thank you new york
thank you thank you
meet khnumhotep and niankhkhnum
the bert and ernie of ancient egypt
many scholars believe
that they are the first recorded
samesex couple in history
yet to this day
there are historians who refuse to
believe that these men were lovers
and insist that they
were brothers instead
thus began 5000 years
of queer love stories
erased from the history books
no gay love stories to teach us about
love and how to love each other
well im happy to say
this erasure ends today
and i am thrilled to announce
i have accepted a position
as the executive director
of the first national
lgbtq history museum
right here in new york city
thank you new york thank you
thank you so much
hey whats up
hey whats up

hey whats up
thank you
you want to finish

okay ill get you
something for that
thanks
an8for me the cold and
awkward grindr hookup
an8is often followed by a walk
around the city by myself
anyone else do that
an8its weird because you still
had this romantic encounter
even though it was odd or unsatisfying
and you dont even know the person
youre still feeling this kind of
postsex warmth and wistfulness
so i usually walk
around for a bit
and i kind of coast on that warm
feeling as long as it lasts
and between the weird sex with
strangers that you dont like
and conversations with friends you love
that you would never have sex with
you know you cobble together a
version of a romantic single life
and its good you
know it works
its a lot more than what a lot of
other people have in this world
and you try to remember that
as always this podcast is
brought to you by career donkey
hi hi im sorry
i know im sorry
whats going on what did i
miss how are you guys lucas

thank you
bye marty
bye yall

so whats happening didnt
you guys have an announcement

a little weird and unexpected
but the reason weve been
hanging around with marty so much
is that we are kind of
dating him
okay
wait a second wait wait wait
what do you mean
youre dating him
i mean together like as
a couple were seeing him
i guess its kind of like
a throuple situation
hold on so wait what
does that mean exactly
like are you guys just having
threesomes or something
well we hooked up but then we started
spending a bunch of time together after
it turns out we have
a lot in common
its more than just sex we
genuinely like each other

months and you didnt tell me

this and its a slippery slope
these things are fragile
and you know were men
okay men dating men
love is not love we are horny
and selfish and stupid i am too
someone called into my show the other
day and asked me why im still single
i said you want to know why

to do its on my neck
bees are dying dont you read

yes yes yes here its okay
youre touching the bee
i know okay
wow thank you
youre like a grownup
gay boy scout
and im like whatever ends
up happening to evan hansen
let me see whats playing
whats your favorite
movie of all time
whats my favorite movie
of all time i dont know
why whats your favorite movie
the hangover
the hangover is your
favorite movie of all time
how many movies
have you seen one
its a funny movie
yeah kinda
and you remember one of the
first lines of that movie
paging dr faggot remember that
yes
paging dr faggot is
one of the first lines
of the highestgrossing comedy of
2009 and no one talks about it right
and it wasnt that long ago were
just supposed to laugh it off
it doesnt bother me im
not sensitive like that
i think you just like
getting angry at things
getting angry at things
is like your brand
what no its not fuck you
getting angry at things is
my brand no no no no
you just dont like to complain because
that means your feelings were hurt
and that means admitting youre
weak and thats too vulnerable
and as much as we go around
saying men should be vulnerable
you and i both know
that is such bullshit
because for a lot
of these gay guys
sweetness and vulnerability
are wonderful and lovely
but they can also be
a real boner killer
youre very intense
yes
i was kidding by the way
about what
the hangover its not my favorite movie
no you werent
yeah i was i just like
seeing you get riled up
i dont believe you
i was kidding
hmm
i dont like this
okay lets see what
we have here mmmmm
oh the treasure inside is supposed
to be really good actually
whats that about
its about two closeted gay frontiersmen
in the california gold rush of 1849
but really its about two straight actors
playing gay trying to win an oscar
i never tire of watching
two very straight actors
really transform themselves
into being sad and gay
gay actors playing gay
thats not even acting
oh i totally agree
if they ever make a movie about my life
theyd better hire a straight actor
i like to think of my life
story as just another way
for benedict cumberbatch
to really score
okay if we dont see this
movie what are we gonna do
i didnt say i didnt
want to see the movie
oh
ill see the fucking movie
im dying to
id put it way above
call me by your name
but sort of below dallas buyers
well it got me in the end
yeah but why does it
always have to be so tragic
i dont know philadelphia
milk brokeback
happy endings dont win oscars
straight people love
seeing us miserable
mmm
wait aaron shepard
josh evans holy shit

go can i ask you one thing though
why did you text me if
you didnt wanna hook up
im not angry im
just honestly curious
i didnt say i
didnt wanna i
i guess i had fun talking
to you at the club
and i wanted to say
hey whats up
hey whats up so
basically you texted me
when you were feeling hungover
and lonely in that moment
but youre not actually into me
but you went on the date anyway
why are gay guys so weird
actually you know
were not weird
were just constantly catering
to our own whims and needs
which can change on a dime
but we never even think about
the emotional consequences
of the other person
anyway its been a blast
catering to your whims
and honestly i cant
really say anything about it
because i do the same thing
to people all the time so
fun day
fun day
and um
yeah
have fun with those guys
okay bye
bobby wait

to have his gay uncle around
oh my god of course im always here
to be a good guncle to my gnephew
uncle bobby will you read my
report its about freddie mercury
hes obsessed with
bohemian rhapsody
oh my god i love this
and like that movie does your report take
a story about one of the great gay icons
and make it about that one time
he maybe had sex with a woman
i thought freddie mercury was bi
he had a wife
yeah well so did
jesus and he was gay
this is excellent and an
improvement on the film good job
what are those gifs
from the hangover
nothing this guy i went out
with wont stop texting me
a guy
really like a grindr guy
no shockingly i actually
met this one in real life
bobby thats fantastic you
think youre gonna see him again
no he told me he prefers
group sex to oneonone
because oneonone is too intense
and makes it a whole thing
we went on one date and we
had sex with three people
gay relationships these
days are like a clown car
oh theres another one oh
look another one another one
its ridiculous plus i
dont think im his type
how do you know
because i know
he told me he likes country music and
his favorite singer is garth brooks
what kind of gay man says his
favorite singer is garth brooks
that scares me
plus i see the guys he likes
they all look exactly like him
theyre all these big hot
straightacting dudes its just not me
is he a top or bottom
what does that have to do with anything
maybe youre both bottoms
and thats the problem
im not always
the bottom edgar
bottom dance
yeah
ooh bottom dance
oohooh uhuhuh
oh my god
gay sex was more fun
when straight people were
uncomfortable with it
fucking schitts creek
maybe we should stop talking about
anal sex in front of your children
oh please its a natural part of life
nah
bobby ask him out again
you never like anyone
he is so handsome
so are you
dude youre a hottie
he is on another level
hes like gay tom brady
when im with him i feel
like friggin elphaba
i bet hes as intimidated by you
as you are by him
oh yeah
im telling you hes
scared of being vulnerable
gay guys from your generation still have
all these pentup masculinity issues
you all need to get
over it already
half the kids in brians
class are nonbinary
well its not fair tina we
had aids and they had glee
but there is a work thing i was thinking
of maybe inviting him to maybe
what a work thing with lots
of celebrities and fancy people
now are you gonna
peacock to impress him
no its just a big
fundraiser for the museum
and i need to bring someone
are you gonna be onstage
no i am not going to
be onstage okay
i am not some sort of
narcissistic sociopath
thank you doja cat
everyone there are rock paintings in
zimbabwe which depict homosexuality
that date back to
the year 2000 bce
if only the men on those paintings
had lived another 4000 years
to see a character come out on
its always sunny in philadelphia
who did your chin
oh no its real
yeah mine too
please continue
to give generously
so the museum can tell all the stories
in between that have never been told
thank you very much good night
yeah all right
hey im so sorry i left you
alone things got a little crazy
no hey dude you were awesome
i mean i could never do that
speak in front of a bunch
of people like that
you move in some pretty
fancy circles i had no idea
trust me its not
always this glamorous
bobby that was amazing as always
oh thank you charles
congrats on everything
thank you so much thank you for coming
thank you
great speech bobby
hi thank you so much
hey do you wanna see the museum
i can give you a private tour
oh sure i dont wanna drag
you away from all this though
oh no its fine here that way
yeah okay
an8this is the legends pavilion
unsung heroes from lgbtq history
marsha p johnson
and sylvia rivera
usually stonewall is the only thing
straight people know about queer history
truthfully no one really knows who
threw the first bricks at stonewall
but it was trans women of
color like marsha and sylvia
who drove the earliest days of
the queer liberation movement
so what do you think its
pretty incredible right
yeah i mean its
really impressive
but
but its kinda depressing
its depressing it
made you depressed
its aids and nazis
and homophobia
all of its just
its kind of a downer
okay well what were you
expecting a night at the museum
honestly my family
loves that movie
oh okay
oh what if you did something like that
where the things they come
alive and they talk at you
where the things come
alive and they talk at you
yeah
like what exactly
oh oh what if we had a bust
of eleanor roosevelt right
yeah
and you get really close
and then all of a sudden you
realize thats not eleanor roosevelt
its amy schumer
oh
no its a museum its
not supposed to be fun
bobby weve got debra
messings agent on the zoom
its urgent
debras worried that shes on
the verge of being canceled
she said in an interview that
she was the viola davis of tufts
and people are mad
her agent is saying that she may give
a very big donation to the museum
to save face
whos debra messing

yeah josh evans
from high school
i actually ran into him and his
fiancée on the street the other day
well they just broke up
and you wanna know why
because hes gay
josh ev no
im definitely embarrassed about
how long this has taken me
but im told people do
this in their own time
ive been empowered by my
hero colton underwood
to say that as it turns out
im gay
an8and like this post if you
like that im gay peace
holy shit
so we started going back
and forth for a while
and then at the end i was just like
why dont you call the album lemonade
bobby when youre ready
what
when youre ready
sorry
okay people wonder if america is
ready for its first gay president
i say we already had one
for the final wing
please consider
the lincoln letters a
gay american love story
for years historians have
speculated about lincolns sexuality
he shared a bed and exchanged intimate
letters with multiple men over the years
including joshua speed
and david derickson
okay im stopping you
bobby it wont work you
cant say lincoln was gay
why
theres no way to confirm those
were sexual relationships
theres no evidence of love
of course theres no
evidence of love robert
we werent allowed to exist how
would we have enough evidence
lincoln was married to a
woman and had four children
he was not gay bobby
he might have been bi
i am telling you
we have let the world erase gay love
stories since the beginning of time
this is our chance to reject
the shame and restore the truth
and if we dont do this
were letting them win
were letting the
heterosexual terrorists win
the heterosexual terrorists
thats right
there are also gay terrorists
and there are bi terrorists okay
there are many bisexual terrorists
okay there are
trans terrorists too
caitlyn jenner
enough people
lets vote on it
okay
looks like we have two votes for
the great bisexuals of the world
thank you someone
and three votes for the
lincoln letters lincoln wins
yes thank you thank you

im sorry
was there something
else you wanted to do
bobby i need to
tell you something
when i was younger
what happened
i
you can tell me
when i was younger i wanted
to make little chocolates
you wanted to make
little chocolates
yes i used to tell my parents that i
was going to the arcade at the mall
but i would sneak off to godiva
i just loved how all the
chocolates were wrapped
and i thought about how i
would design my own chocolates
how each little chocolate has its
own specific unique design on it
and that little design tells you
what theyre gonna taste like
so i would draw my own
chocolates in a notepad
its all i thought about
tiny little pretty chocolates
thats good
what was i gonna do with that
though what was i gonna be
a chocolatier
bobby i wasnt gonna be
a fucking chocolatier
i dont know why not
it seemed kinda faggy
oh my god aaron
faggy
its not faggy to spend your life
making pretty little chocolates
bobby
okay fine but so what
so youre a big fag
so am i its great
did you not realize
that a few minutes ago
when you were sticking your
enormous penis into my tiny anus
okay yeah its kind of
cliché dont you think
id rather be a cliché
than be miserable
well my 15yearold brain in
1995 that is all i thought about
that was right around the time
that my brother caught me
hooking up with a guy
no no i was making
little chocolates
oh
i lied and i said that i was
making chocolates for this girl
that i had a crush on at school
im sorry this is the
cutest thing ive ever heard
i guess you just have
this big exciting life
i just didnt want you to think
that i was some boring schlub
i dont think youre boring
your friend said i was boring
oh my god you
were mad about that
i was joking im sorry
but i dont understand
you dont have to be stuck in
that miserable office all day
you could be out in the world i
dont know making fudge you know
youre like a keebler elf
with internalized homophobia
you have to do this you
have to become a chocolatier
oh bobby
you have to become a
chocolatier im telling you
you make that sound so easy
well no its not easy
nothings easy
my god you know what i
have to do this weekend
i have to drag my concave chest up to
provincetown and beg donors for money
i need five million dollars
or else the museum cant open
and its pride up there
so the museum has to have a float in
the parade and thats a whole thing
im telling you it is not
easy it is never easy
but its worth it
hey maybe i can come

very few people know this
but our most popular president
was also our first gay president
sorry this is a lincoln museum

lgbtq history museum
its the first of its kind on a
national level we actually
that fucking bush

bush and it blocks my view

lets go take care of this
again with this
this is my property maurice
this is a shared borderline
this is a fucking disaster
he wont even listen to me
hes too busy getting his
rottweiler ready for pride

experience at my job
weird rich people just
want to be listened to
ask him what hes interested in
but i dont care what hes interested
in im here to pitch him my idea

interested just do a listening face
do a listening face

all right listening
ill try it ill try it
sorry i have to
get going boys
oh mr grape let
me ask you something
um what would you like
to see in the museum
a haunted house of gay trauma
a haunted house of gay trauma
yeah its a cart on a
track and theres
im sorry this is a ride
yeah its a fucking ride so
you think a ride is too much
um no no
no no no no its
perfect please keep going
okay we find ourselves
in an intimate little bar
with some young
hot animatronic men
the men turn to dance with
each other when suddenly boom
a cop car smashes
through the wall
police storm out of the cars
theres sirens and batons
and voices screaming
and suddenly the car takes
off like a roller coaster
and theres blood everywhere
and a monster with reagans face on it
is chasing you down the hallway saying
shining city on a hill
shining city on a hill
and then we shoot
out into the light
and it ends on something happy
like lil nas x working
out with pink dumbbells
wow
a gay trauma coaster
i mean its its
very provocative
i just dont think we can afford
that sort of thing unfortunately
right well okay it was
so lovely meeting you g
mr grape mr grape
im not a creative guy im a money guy
no no no no
no no
i can tell you to
accomplish what you want
we need more than just
a little donation
no aaron
we need five million dollars
and you wont just get
the gay trauma coaster
you get the lincoln
exhibit you get all of it
you rewrite history for
an entire lgbtq community
youre a storyteller lawrence
and this is the ultimate story
you already pushed the
museum opening back twice
is it really happening
yes its definitely happening i promise
my entire life has led up to this
right well five million dollars is
nothing to rewrite history im in
wait really
yes yes
oh my god
mr grape thank you
of course congratulations
on my money
happy pride
happy pride
now i have to go to a pride party and
youre both too old to be in the pool
please leave
aaron oh my god
youre a genius youre a storyteller
where did that even come from
i told you im good at
talking to weird rich folk
i could tell he
had money to spend
i dont know what
to say thank you

thank you
okay
i kissed you are we
kissing each other now
i dont know bye
bobby
youre gorgeous
what you are
i still cant believe what
you did with lawrence today
that was amazing
five million dollars
its not that big a deal
it is a huge deal
are you kidding me
i always have to do everything for myself
no one ever does shit like that for me
you know what you did for
me you could do for yourself
open a chocolate
shop i dont know
im not opening
a chocolate shop
im not as confident as you
oh please im
not that confident
you are the most confident
person i know like to a fault
its actually
its kind of scary
trust me its all an act
confidence is just a choice you
make its a decision like any other
usually born out of necessity
you think i have a
good singing voice now
you should have heard me when
i was a kid i was even better
had american idol existed then
i wouldve been the gay guy with an
amazing voice who comes in second
and then lets see
then i went to college
and my musical theater teacher
he told me that i had a gay
walk and a flamboyant quality
which would limit my options
and then for grad school
i went to one of the best
journalism schools in the country
and my teacher there this old closeted
queen who was married to a woman
pulled me aside and thought
he was doing me a favor
when he told me that i
should stick to writing
because my voice sounded too
gay to do the news on tv
true story
and then i did stick to writing
and my gay history books
every single publisher
every single one
told me there wasnt enough
of an audience for it
i was always too gay
or i was too niche
or you know i made
people uncomfortable
even my dad who was so
wonderful and supportive
i remember him saying
you know not everyone wants to
hear this gay stuff all the time
but what was i supposed to do
i mean im a writer
i wanted to write about my
life my friends my world
and im telling you enough
people tell you things like that
no matter how confident you are
when youre alone at night
you start to think that
maybe theyre right
so
i just put my head down
and i just worked really hard
and i just hoped that somehow
all these other
people were wrong
and they were
and they were
i mean
i spent years watching a wave of
mediocre straight men passing me by
men with half the talent
who worked half as hard
who didnt care as much as i did
and they got twice as far always
i mean thats an
old story but
and you know the
world caught up with us
didnt catch up fast enough
didnt catch up fast enough
for my parents to see all these
great things happen for me
right
didnt catch up fast
enough for a lot of people
thats the truth
let me tell you
confidence is just knowing youre the
only person left you can count on
thats all that is
thats all
want another beer
sure
sorry that was a lot
did that weird you out
i love this song
that is a weird dance
excuse me at least i dance
i can dance
i have never seen you
dance literally no one has
really
no
wanna see me dance

ebenezer scrooge
bobby i think they get it

bobby josh and aaron played
hockey together in high school
oh i know
come on
hey man whats going on how you doing
dude what is your problem
what
could you just maybe
tone it down a notch
im sorry i dont understand
weve been with my
parents for two hours
and youve already talked about
transgender mannequins hiv prevention
and you pointed out the
route to the 1976 dyke march
theyre having fun theyre
totally fine what is your problem
im nervous okay ive never
introduced them to anybody
i just dont want them
to get weirded out
i want them to have
a chill normal time
so now im not normal
bobby you know what i mean
im just being myself
okay but maybe you could just be a
little less yourself for three hours
i want them to like you
oh yeah no sure
of course yeah ill just
ill just be quiet
okay thank you
bobby oh my god hi
hi
jesus christ
we have to go anyway we
have a dinner reservation
wheres dinner again
hey dad how are the
polar bears doing
thats the team josh
and i used to play on
they havent won all year
i told josh they need
you boys to come back
bobby you seem quiet tonight
is everything all right
oh yeah im
totally fine yeah
you know im sorry if
i spoke too much today
i just i think i got nervous
this is actually more
like how i usually am
im very quiet very quiet
and just weirdly normal
well thanks again for
planning such a lovely day
oh youre so
welcome mrs shepard
you sound like one of my
students call me anne
okay i will
moms been a secondgrade
teacher for almost 40 years now
oh my god thats amazing we need
good teachers now more than ever
thank you i agree
and aaron says youre working
at an american history museum
yes yes it is
its an american history museum
mmhmm
well its actually an
lgbtq history museum
its the first major queer
history museum in america
do you teach your
students any gay history
cause i know in a few states
theyre finally starting to do it
well i teach
second grade so no
oh right no i
understand yeah
out of curiosity why not
well
i just think theyre a
little young for that
of course yeah no
i understand that
i dont think so though
bobby
no no no im just saying
if i may disagree respectfully
thats actually the best time to
teach them when theyre young
you know that way they develop
an appreciation for queer people
before they all start bullying each other
or hating themselves if theyre gay
maybe youre right
feels a little young though
right
totally i get it
i will drop it agree to disagree
yeah
cheers to that
yes
so when are you
guys heading home
its not really that young
though its not that young
bobby can you please drop it
no i cant because were talking
about gay kids here and its important
one of the things that saved me
is that my parents exposed me
to gay stories when i was a kid
when i was 12 years
old this is true
my parents took me to see a broadway
play called love and compassion
it was about a group of gay men spending
the summer together in provincetown
and all of a sudden
the curtain goes up
and there are seven completely
naked gay men on stage
and there i am sitting between
my mom and dad at age 12
looking at seven soft penises
shit
and all of a sudden two of
the guys start making out
and then one of them starts
talking dirty you know
and i remember this so vividly
there was a sex scene and
one of the guys is like
pound my prostate pound my prostate
you know milk me milk me
and i didnt even know what
that was i mean now i do
but you know it
was incredible
you know to know that i could
sit there between my mom and dad
looking at seven penises
seven penises anne i was 12
and to know that they were okay with that
i mean that had a profound effect on me
all im saying is we need to remove
the stigma from that type of thing
so that gay kids can feel good about
themselves thats all im saying
i mean look at aaron and
how much he hates his life
bobby
all im saying
is theres a direct correlation between
how unhappy you are with your life
and what you werent taught
about your potential as a child
bobby stop talking
seriously enough
i will kill you
aaron you hate your life
your brothers a
real chatterbox
hey are you mad
me no im great
josh just texted me im
gonna meet him at that bar
i think we should
go home and talk
really you want to talk more
i think its better
than partying with josh
the selfloathing meathead
who took 40 years to come out
not everybodys you bobby
okay but 40 years jrr tolkien
took less time with his journey
god you are fucking relentless
aaron hates his life
god
hey
hey
fuck
okay okay okay okay
big man
dude no
hey just kiss me
aaron
hey bob
shit bobby we were
just playing around
you were just playing around
what the fuck is wrong with you
bobby bobby
josh leave
im sorry
get the fuck out of here
bobby calm down
oh my god i knew
it i fucking knew it

oh man
guys
hey
hey
can we talk
okay
so whats up
bobby i am so sorry i told
you not to be yourself
i know i fucked up but
this is new for me too
and when you blew up in front
of my parents honestly it
it felt like you were
doing it on purpose
i was
and im sorry
i shouldnt have handled
it like that youre right
im sorry
but aaron
that doesnt change the fact that
you like a certain type of guy
and that isnt me
and thats okay
youre right
i always pictured
myself with a guy
like josh
yeah a guy like josh
yeah hes hot
yes hes simple
conventional basic as hell
and not somebody that
actually makes me happy
bobby you are so
different from me
youre not afraid to take up space
in the world you challenge me
which at first
it freaked me out
because who the fuck wants to
be challenged all the time but
but i love it
youre whats been missing
i know i fucked up but
please give me another chance
i miss you so much
i miss you too
a lot
i didnt realize until
after we broke up
there were actually a couple
of months there where i was
what do they call it
in a good mood
but i cant
my whole life i have prided
myself on being selfaware
and selfreliant
and selfpossessed
and it didnt matter
it didnt matter
because at the end of the day
i just ended up in the street
looking at you and
looking at josh
and thinking im
not enough for him
i know and i feel awful
but do not throw this away
because of one mistake
what do you want me to do
say youll give me another chance
i cant do that
why not
cause i dont trust you
ive been alone so
long who knows
maybe thats the only
way i know how to be
i dont know
im going
its good
hey
if you dont trust
me thats fine
but if for some reason underneath
all that strength and confidence
you still dont trust that
you are lovable enough
im living proof
that youre wrong
first of all thank you
all for letting me do this
i really appreciate it
look i know ive been a very
angry judgmental person obviously
and sometimes anger can be
good i know you all know that
because for years it was the
fuel we all needed to keep going
it wasnt that long ago that the
straight gatekeepers of the world
didnt allow for all of us to
really succeed in a big way
oh my god do you guys
remember straight people
yeah they had a nice run
look bobby im a
black trans woman
and i dont need you to come
here and lecture me about anger
but i get it
i am brimming with anger
and if i were to let
just an ounce of it out
i would probably explode
and kill every one of you
but bobby i want
you to know something
i hear you
and i forgive you
you do
yes
look this is the only community
ive ever loved being a part of
and we fight like crazy
and we always have
but youre my people
and i am so sorry that i was
so rude and spoke down to you
i shouldve shown you
much more respect
there is truly no group of people on
earth that i love and respect more
well i am not going to
lie i am still angry
but i insist on progress
not just for our lgbtq heroes
but for our lgbtq assholes
like you
thank you robert
the live of this
apology has 40k viewers
youre posting this
can you please
no okay yeah no you
should definitely post this
everything should
everything should be posted and
thank you for teaching me that

i do this kamala harris impression
online and its really taking off

whatever youre doing

the first person to see this

factory i made these little chocolates
i also made some special treats
to celebrate the opening
of the lgbtq museum

valentines day box
filled with chocolates

triangle filled with chocolates
and a tribute to my favorite
gay television character
this is
a tiramisusan from friends
of course aaron likes friends
of course all the
profits go to the museum

stubborn little bitch

hey guys its your girl tamara
were opening the lgbt museum tonight
tonight is our grand opening and
were gonna have a wonderful time
yeah whats up
whats up
hi im leonardo da vinci
i changed the world with my work as
an inventor scientist and artist
but most importantly
i may have been bi
arrivederci
congrats youve made it to
the obama administration
but whats that
around the corner
okay seriously this
place is incredible
are you happy
i dont know its
weird you know
this place was my
dream and it happened
why cant i answer
your question
okay can i just say one thing
yes
i know that what
he did was wrong
but you didnt have to
argue with his parents
i did though
plus i apologized
and he apologized too
i just dont know
if i can trust him
he fucked up people fuck up
is there no part of you that
wants to give him a second chance
you know what it is
i just dont want to want
someone else this much
but you do
it doesnt make you look
weak to love someone
vulnerability is
not a boner killer
i know you
i know that youve had a million reasons
to keep your guard up all these years
but there are people out there
worth letting your guard down for
were you happier with
him or without him
thats all that really matters
can i tell you something extremely
embarrassing that i would only tell you
yes
i wrote a song about him
i know thats the only time im gonna
talk about it were not talking about it
i didnt send it and
im not sending it
okay fine
ive just never seen
you that happy is all
and i love seeing it
hi guys

aaron what the fuck is up with you

what are you people all
training for you going to war
stop playing it so cool
just go and tell
him how you feel
what about you
what about divorce
what about keeping
it young and fun
whatever
straight people were
so set in our ways
but gay people you guys are
all so youre so smart
youre gonna figure it out
my story is not your story
go write your own damn story
go now
okay yeah
hey
hey whats up
hey whats up
hey whats up
yeah
bobby
yeah
its time for the toast
okay great
okay
one of the hardest parts of
putting the museum together
was figuring out what the
final exhibit would be
the message wed leave
people with about who we are
but the truth is we
are not one thing
we are not a monolithic group
we are some of the smartest and most
selfreliant people you will ever meet
and we are so stupid
and we are a total mess
and we are great
weve been around since the
beginning of time of course
and yet it still feels like
were at the very beginning
of being able to
tell our own stories
in many ways i think were still
getting to know each other really
now im just a boring
old cis white gay
but
one thing i have learned from my
trans and bi and nonbinary family
is that happiness for all of us comes from
staying fluid staying open to change
open to being more than just
who you thought you were
or more than what other
people assume you are
so this is a toast to all of us
weve come a long way
and there are a lot of people who deserved
to live long enough to be here tonight
and we are here
and they are not
and we are very lucky
we are very lucky
i have no complaints
hey
hey
um
sorry um
just um one more
thing sorry hold on
im gonna do it lets
do it lets do it
whats going on
hi
so um
this is a little special
something i wrote for tonight
and i didnt think i would
actually have a reason to sing it
and i havent sung in front of people
in a very long time so forgive me
but tonight is about love
and weve seen a lot
of tortured gay cowboys
played by a lot of straight
actors over the years
so this is a love song from
one gay cowboy to another
inspired by everyones
favorite lgbtq icon
garth brooks
bobby i just have
to tell you

thought id say this
