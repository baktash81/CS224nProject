the sun came up 
now  i know an
everyday sunrise
may not seem like
such a big deal to some folks 
but imagine for a moment
if instead of rising up 
like this 
one morning
where you lived
she took a look around
and decided
to go back to sleep 
it happened once to us 
let me tell you
all about it   
 chanticleer 
  cock a doo  
  hoo hoo hoo hoo  
  whoa  
  yo da lay ee  
  cock a doo what a day  
  the sun is shinin  brightly  
  cock a doo sunny day  
  down here on the farm  
  cock a doo stay away  
  you big ole
wet ole rain cloud  
  or i ll cry out loud
with this voice of mine  
 narrator  this was
our rooster chanticleer 
and though it was true
that he liked to
horse around some 
the fact was 
that boy could sing 
  sun  sun  sun
sun do shine  sun do shine  
  well  my daddy
taught me how to sing  
  and that s why
this voice means everything  
 narrator  we all had
our jobs on the farm 
and chanticleer s
was to wake up the sun 
and when he crowed 
up she came 
hey  look 
here s me tyin  my shoes 
hi  patou 
whatcha doin  
i m tryin  to tie
these doggone shoes 
huh  again 
well  hi  ladies 
oh  he s so handsome 
he sings
like a dream 
he is a dream 
and he s single  too 
 patou 
he maybe wasn t
the smartest bird
that ever lived 
but when he crowed 
there was plenty
of peace and harmony 
hey 
well  plenty
of harmony  anyway 
and lots of sunshine 
  well  my daddy
taught me how to sing  
  that s why this voice
means everything  
  sun do shine
you better shine  
  well  the sun do shine
you better shine  
   you better shine  
   you better shine  
   you better shine  
   you better shine  
   you better shine  
   you better shine  
  you better shine  
  sun  you better shine  
  dik a dik ca
ca dik a dik a down down  
 all laughing 
 patou 
there was no doubt about it 
old chanticleer
kept us animals
up and shining 
 all 
good day  mr  chanticleer 
but all that
was about to change 
one morning 
before chanticleer
was even awake 
 a stranger snuck
onto our farm   
 hey  chanticleer 
   to stop chanticleer
from crowing 
of course  chanticleer
wouldn t give up
without a fight 
but what he didn t know
was that this stranger
had been sent
by the grand duke of owls 
a nasty fella 
the good news here
was that chanticleer
had won the fight 
the bad news was
the grand duke s bully
had done his dirty deed 
for in all the commotion 
chanticleer had plum forgot
to crow 
and the sun was comin  up
without him 
 animals gasp 
when chanticleer saw this 
it broke his heart 
he reckoned maybe his crow
never did raise the sun 
look  it s comin  up
without him 
you re a phony 
 man  he s a fake 
hey  everybody 
cock a doodle doo 
the grand duke s evil plan
had worked 
he had turned us against
our very best friend 
and without a reason to crow 
poor chanticleer
left the farm
to look for work in the city 
then came the rain 
and our troubles
with the duke 
 edmond 
who s that  mom 
 mother 
that s the grand duke 
he s the one who s
causing all the trouble 
he sent that mean old rooster
to chanticleer s farm
to pick a fight 
hmm  how come 
because he didn t
like chanticleer
doing all that crowing
and bringing up
the sun 
how come 
well  like most owls 
he likes the darkness
and the rain 
i m not afraid
of the dark 
 gasping 
oh  it s you 
you scared me 
dorie  we got
big problems 
have you looked out there 
if that rain doesn t stop 
we re all gonna go
floatin  down the river 
 patou 
this is my favorite part
of the story 
his name is edmond 
 course  he didn t look
quite like this
when i first met him 
anyhow  we weren t
the only folks
havin  our troubles 
poor edmond s family
was havin  their share  too 
the river s
rising too fast 
we ve got to
reinforce the sandbags 
you think
that ll work 
we ll make it work 
i ll get the boys 
me  too 
you stop
right there 
oh  mom 
i m one of the boys 
he meant
the big boys 
i m big enough 
not yet
you re not  darling 
 radio 
the u s  weather bureau
is expecting another night
of disastrous downpour
in the areas worst hit
by this week s flooding 
 dad  scott  mark 
bring the truck
around to the front 
come on  guys 
move it  i need some help 
we gotta get
the animals inside 
 patou 
so while scott and mark
got to help protect the house
against the flood 
poor edmond was left behind
where he d be safe
and out of trouble 
it s my house  too 
i want to help 
then pray for
the rain to stop 
and that will help 
 dad 
dorie  i can t find
the flashlight 
coming 
now  you stay here
where it s safe  pumpkin 
i m gonna help your father 
i ll be right back 
great  let s go 
dad  they said on the radio
the national guard might come 
i am too one of the big boys 
 edmond reading 
and without a reason to crow 
chanticleer left the farm 
then came the rain   
mom  here 
how is she  frank 
start the truck 
she ll be okay 
dorie  hurry 
i know the answer 
we need chanticleer 
mom 
boys  the levee s breaking 
chanticleer 
chanticleer 
 patou 
edmond had the right idea
to call for chanticleer 
but he never could have guessed
who was going to answer   
chanticleer 
no   
it s not chanticleer 
who are you 
you put your finger
in the duke s face 
remember 
these are expensive 
little brat 
but that is not why
the duke is going to eat you 
eat me 
oh  dear  now i ve gone
and spoiled the surprise 
i m always doing that 
but  you see 
we creatures of the night
have worked very hard
to make absolutely sure
that that bird does not return 
and you   
you  with no regard
for the feelings of others 
have the nerve
to call him back here by name 
and besides 
i positively loathe
rock  n  roll 
 laughs boisterously 
you re not gonna eat me 
 patou 
and that s when the duke
hit the ceiling 
if edmond wanted
to bring chanticleer back
to raise the sun 
the duke was going to have
something to say about it 
kittens are more digestible 
young edmond was about to have
the most amazing adventure
he d ever dreamed of 
 laughs 
 the duke laughing 
ah   
mom  dad 
wake me up 
this is where i come in 
ow 
yi yi yi yi yi 
you ll pay for this  patou 
this does not concern you 
it does if it s
about chanti 
the light  owls hate the light 
 screams

oh  that flashlight biz was
quick thinking on your part

yeah  he s gone 
but he ll be back 
and he won t be alone 
the coward 
i would have whopped him

bunions

old chanticleer
had found himself a city perch
sort of tailored to remind him
of the farm he d left behind 
trouble was 
with goldie on the scene 
he wasn t feeling so lonesome
for us anymore 
which was exactly
the way pinky wanted it 
because that was
exactly the way
the grand duke wanted it 
there was just one problem
with their plan  of course 
goldie was only supposed
to pretend to fall in love
with chanticleer 
but she was
falling in love for real 
and that can really change
a pheasant 
  love has said hello  
  you don t know  
  what that means  
  really means to me  
oh 
i think we ve lost him 
what do you mean 
he s right there 
no  no  no 
he ain t 
he s 1 000 miles away 
huh 
oh  isn t it romantic 
when roosters
fall in love 
they lose all reason 
enough mush 
let s go eat 
eat  how can you
think of food
at a time like this 
lasagna 
chanticleer 
chanticleer
