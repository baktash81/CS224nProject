so sheryl i couldnt help noticing
dwayne has stopped speaking
yeah hes taken a vow of silence
youve taken a vow of silence
hes gonna join the air force academy
become a test pilot
and hes taken a vow of silence
until he reaches that goal
youre kidding
hi uncle frank
oh hey olive
wow youre getting big
almost like a real person
what happened to your arms
olive
thats all right i had a little accident im okay
hows the routine coming honey
its good
yeah
when are you gonna show it to us
i dont know its up to grandpa
a couple of days it still needs work
whats that chicken
every night its the fucking chicken
holy god almighty
dad
is it possible just once we could get
dad
something to eat for dinner around here
thats not the goddamn fucking chicken
hey
hey dad
im just saying
dad
christ
whenever you want to start cooking
your own food youre more than welcome
at sunset manor you know
if you like sunset manor so much
you shouldnt have gotten yourself
kicked out of there right
for gods sakes
so when did you start with the vow
been nine months frank
he hasnt said a word
not one
i think it shows tremendous discipline
richard
i really do
really i think we could learn
something from dwayne
dwayne has a goal
he has a dream
it may not be my dream
it may not be yours
but hes pursuing it with
great conviction and focus
in fact i was thinking about the 9 steps
oh for crying out loud
about the 9 steps and how
dwaynes utilizing at least 7 of them
in his personal quest to selffulfillment
richard please
well
im just saying ive come around
i think he could use our support
how did it happen
how did what happen
your accident
honey here
oh no its okay
unless you object
mmmm
no im prohonesty here
i just think you know its up to you
be my guest
olive uncle frank didnt
really have an accident
what happened was he
tried to kill himself
you did why
im sorry i dont think this is
an appropriate conversation
honey lets let uncle frank
finish his dinner okay
why did you wanna kill yourself
no dont answer the question frank
richard
dont answer it
richard
hes not gonna answer the question frank
i wanted to kill myself
dont listen to him honey
because i was very unhappy
hes sick hes a sick man
hes a sick in his head man
richard
im sorry i dont think its an appropriate
conversation for a 7yearold
well shes gonna find out anyway
oh okay
go on frank
why were you unhappy
well there are a lot of reasons
mainly though i fell in love with
someone who didnt love me back
who
one of my grad students
i was very much in love with him
him
it was a boy you fell in love with a boy
yes i did very much so
thats silly
youre right it was silly
it was very very silly
theres another word for it
dad
so thats when you tried to kill yourself
well no
the boy that i was in love with fell in love
with another man larry sugarman
whos larry sugarman
larry sugarman is perhaps
the second most highly regarded
proust scholar in the us
whos number one
that would be me rich
really
mmhm
so thats when
no
what happened was i was a bit upset
so i said some things
that i shouldnt have said
and i did some things
that i shouldnt have done
and subsequently i was fired from my job
and forced to move out of my apartment
and move into a motel
and thats when you tried to
well no
actually all of that was okay
what happened was two days ago
the macarthur foundation
in its infinite wisdom
awarded a genius grant to larry sugarman
and thats when
decided to check out early
yes yes and i failed at that as well
olive the important thing
to understand here
is that uncle frank gave up on himself
he made a series of foolish choices
im sorry and he gave up on himself
which is something that winners never do
so thats the story okay
now everyone just lets move on and
is he always like this
how can you stand it
olive tell him about your routine
while youre doing this
okay little miss chili pepper is a beauty
contest for everyone in albuquerque
but you have to be 6 or 7
and you have to be a girl
this is our sister
cindy
spring break
dwayne went to see his dad
in florida for two weeks
and olive went to laguna
to see her cousins
she made it to the top
of the regionals out there
i was in second place
well what do you think your chances are
i think i can win
because some of the other girls
theyve been doing it longer
but i practice every day
yeah good luck
not about luck frank
luck is the name losers
give to their own failings
its about wanting to win
willing yourself to win
youve got to want it badder
than anybody else
i do
then youre gonna be a winner
richard
its the truth
you know actually there is a message
from cindy on the machine
something about little mrs sunshine
sunshine
what
little miss sunshine
yeah
what
sheryl its cindy
remember when olive was here last month
she was runnerup in the
regional little miss sunshine
well they just called right now and said that
the girl who won had to forfeit her crown

french writer total loser

that all those years he suffered
those were the best years of his life
cause they made him who he was
