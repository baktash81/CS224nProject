  we re coming 
  frank  some sprite

and i want everyone to have
at least a little salad 
thanks  sheryl 
honey 
so  sheryl  i couldn t help noticing
dwayne has stopped speaking 
yeah  he s taken a vow of silence 
you ve taken a vow of silence 
he s gonna join the air force academy 
become a test pilot 
and he s taken a vow of silence
until he reaches that goal 
you re kidding 
  hi  uncle frank 
  oh  hey  olive 
wow  you re getting big 
almost like a real person 
  what happened to your arms 
  olive 
that s all right  i had a little accident  i m okay 
how s the routine coming  honey 
  it s good 
  yeah 
when are you gonna show it to us 
i don t know  it s up to grandpa 
a couple of days  it still needs work 
what s that  chicken 
every night it s the fucking chicken 
  holy god almighty 
  dad 
  is it possible just once we could get   
  dad 
   something to eat for dinner around here   
     that s not the goddamn fucking chicken 
  hey 
hey  dad 
  i m just saying 
  dad 
christ 
whenever you want to start cooking
your own food  you re more than welcome 
  at sunset manor  you know   
  if you like sunset manor so much 
you shouldn t have gotten yourself
kicked out of there  right 
for god s sakes 
so  when did you start with the vow 
been nine months  frank 
he hasn t said a word 
not one 
i think it shows tremendous discipline 
  richard 
  i really do 
really  i think we could learn
something from dwayne 
dwayne has a goal 
he has a dream 
it may not be my dream 
it may not be yours   
but he s pursuing it with
great conviction and focus 
in fact  i was thinking about the 9 steps  
oh  for crying out loud 
about the 9 steps  and how
dwayne s utilizing at least 7 of them
in his personal quest to self fulfillment 
  richard  please 
  well   
i m just saying i ve come around 
i think he could use our support 
how did it happen 
  how did what happen 
  your accident 
  honey  here 
  oh  no  it s okay 
  unless you object 
  mm mm 
no  i m pro honesty here 
i just think  you know  it s up to you 
be my guest 
olive  uncle frank didn t
really have an accident 
what happened was he   
tried to kill himself 
you did   why  
i m sorry  i don t think this is
an appropriate conversation 
honey  let s let uncle frank
finish his dinner  okay 
why did you wanna kill yourself 
  no  don t answer the question  frank 
  richard 
  don t answer it 
  richard 
he s not gonna answer the question  frank 
  i wanted to kill myself   
  don t listen to him  honey 
     because i was very unhappy 
  he s sick  he s a sick man 
  he s a sick in his head man 
  richard 
i m sorry  i don t think it s an appropriate
conversation for a 7 year old 
  well  she s gonna find out anyway 
  oh  okay 
go on  frank 
why were you unhappy 
well  there are a lot of reasons 
mainly  though  i fell in love with
someone who didn t love me back 
who 
one of my grad students 
i was very much in love with him 
him  
it was a boy  you fell in love with a boy 
yes  i did  very much so 
that s silly 
you re right  it was silly 
it was very  very silly 
  there s another word for it 
  dad 
  so  that s when you tried to kill yourself 
  well  no 
the boy that i was in love with fell in love
with another man  larry sugarman 
  who s larry sugarman 
  larry sugarman is  perhaps 
the second most highly regarded
proust scholar in the u s 
  who s number one 
  that would be me  rich 
  really 
  mm hm 
  so  that s when 
  no 
what happened was i was a bit upset 
so  i said some things
that i shouldn t have said
and i did some things
that i shouldn t have done 
and subsequently i was fired from my job
and forced to move out of my apartment
and move into a motel 
  and that s when you tried to   
  well  no 
actually  all of that was okay 
what happened was two days ago
the macarthur foundation 
in its infinite wisdom 
awarded a genius grant to larry sugarman 
and that s when   
decided to check out early 
yes  yes  and i failed at that as well 
olive  the important thing
to understand here
is that uncle frank gave up on himself 
he made a series of foolish choices 
i m sorry  and he gave up on himself 
which is something that winners never do 
so  that s the story  okay 
now  everyone  just let s move on and   
is he always like this 
how can you stand it 
olive  tell him about your routine
while you re doing this 
okay  little miss chili pepper is a beauty
contest for everyone in albuquerque 
but you have to be 6 or 7
and you have to be a girl 
this is our sister 
  cindy 
  spring break 
dwayne went to see his dad
in florida for two weeks 
and olive went to laguna
to see her cousins 
she made it to the top
of the regionals out there 
i was in second place 
well  what do you think your chances are 
i think i can win 
because some of the other girls 
they ve been doing it longer 
but i practice every day 
  yeah  good luck 
  not about luck  frank 
luck is the name losers
give to their own failings 
it s about wanting to win 
willing yourself to win 
you ve got to want it badder
than anybody else 
i do 
  then you re gonna be a winner 
  richard 
it s the truth 
you know  actually  there is a message
from cindy on the machine 
something about little mrs  sunshine 
  sunshine 
  what 
  little miss sunshine 
  yeah 
what  
sheryl  it s cindy 
remember when olive was here last month 
she was runner up in the
regional little miss sunshine 
well  they just called right now and said that
the girl who won had to forfeit her crown 
i don t know why  something
about diet pills  but anyway

contest in redondo beach 
oh  my gosh  i won  i won  i won  i won 
  finish your dinner

not to leave frank by himself 
  no offense  frank

no  richard  that s asking too much 
  if something happened

  frank  shut up 
  richard 
  olive  can i tell you a little something
about ice cream    yeah

which comes from cow s milk 
and cream has a lot of fat in it 
  richard 
  what 
  she s gonna find out anyway  remember

well  when you eat ice cream 
the fat in the ice cream
becomes fat in your body 
  richard  i swear to god 
  it s true

  nothing  honey  nothing s wrong 
so  if you eat a lot of ice cream 
you might become fat 
and if you don t  you re gonna
stay nice and skinny  sweetie 
  mom 
  olive  richard is an idiot 
i like a woman with meat on her bones 
  why s everyone so upset 
  no  no one s upset  honey 
i just want you to understand
it s okay to be skinny  and it s okay

i ll tell you what  you know these old buses 
you don t need the clutch
to change from the 3rd to the 4th 
you only really need the clutch to go
from number 1 to number 2 
but as long as you keep parking on a hill 
and you let it go 
and it goes 15  20 miles per hour 
you start her in 3rd 
and then you go from 3rd to 4th 
what if you re not on a hill  there s no hill

  yeah 
french writer  total loser 
never had a real job 
unrequited love affairs  gay 
spent 20 years writing a book
almost no one reads 
but he s also probably
the greatest writer since shakespeare 
anyway  he    gets down to the end of his life
and he looks back and decides
that all those years he suffered 
those were the best years of his life 
 cause they made him who he was 
all the years he was happy  you know 
total waste  didn t learn a thing
