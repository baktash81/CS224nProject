if we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from a skull   
   there s very little of the midbrain
that we can actually see 
yet  as i demonstrated
in my lecture last week   
   if the under aspects of the temporal lobes
are gently pulled apart   
   the upper portion of the stem of the brain
can be seen 
this so called brainstem
consists of the midbrain   
   a rounded protrusion called the pons   
   and a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata   
   which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum   
   and becomes  of course  the spinal cord 
are there any questions before we proceed 
i have one question  dr frankenstein 
that s fronkonsteen 
i beg your pardon 
my name  it s pronounced  fronkonsteen  
but aren t you the grandson
of the famous dr victor frankenstein   
   who dug up freshly buried corpses
and transformed dead components into   
yes  yes 
yes 
we all know what he did 
but i d rather be remembered
for my own small contributions to science   
   and not because of
my accidental relationship   
   to a famous    cuckoo 
 laughter 
now  if you don t mind 
can we have your question 
well  sir  i m not sure
i understand the distinction   
   between reflexive
and voluntary nerve impulses 
good  since our lab work today
is a demonstration ofjust that distinction   
   why don t we proceed 
mr hilltop here 
with whom i have never worked   
   or given any prior instructions to   
   has graciously offered his services
for today s demonstration 
mr hilltop  would you hop up on your feet
and stand beside this table 
nice    hopping 
mr hilltop   
   would you raise    your left knee  please 
you have just witnessed
a voluntary nerve impulse 
it begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex   
   passes through the brainstem
and to the muscles involved 
mr hilltop  you may lower your knee 
reflex movements are those
which are made independently of the will   
   but are carried out along pathways   
   which pass between the peripheral nervous
system and the central nervous system 
you filthy  rotten  yellow son of a bitch 
 students gasp 
we are not aware of these impulses 
neither do we intend them
to carry out our contraction of muscles 
yet  as you can see  they work by themselves 
but what if we block the nerve impulse
by simply applying local pressure   
   which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp   
   just at the swelling
on the posterior nerve roots   
   for  oh  say    five or six seconds 
why  you mother grabbing bastard 
as you can see 
all communication is shut off 
   hilltop moans 
   students laugh 
in spite of our mechanical magnificence   
   if it were not for this continuous stream
of motor impulses   
   we would collapse   
   like a bunch of broccoli 
ohhh 
 applause 
in conclusion  it should be noted   
  give him an extra dollar 
  extra dollar  yes  sir 
   that any more than common injury   
   moans 
      to the nerve root is always serious 
because once a nerve fibre is severed   
   there is no way  in heaven or on earth   
   to regenerate life back into it 
are there any last questions before we leave 
uh  dr frank   
  fronkonsteen   
  yes 
isn t it true that darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case   
   until  by some extraordinary means   
   it actually began to move
with a voluntary motion 
are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti 
why  the worm  sir 
yes  it seems to me i did read something
of that incident when i was a student 
but you have to remember that a worm 
with very few exceptions   
   is not a human being 
 laughter 
but wasn t that the basis
of your grandfather s work  sir 
the reanimation of dead tissue 
my grandfather was a very sick man 
but as a fronkonsteen 
aren t you the least bit curious about it 
doesn t bringing back to life what was
once dead hold any intrigue for you 
you are talking about
the nonsensical ravings of a lunatic mind 
dead is dead 
but look at what has been done
with hearts and kidneys 
hearts and kidneys are tinkertoys 
i m talking about the central nervous system 
but  sir   
i am a scientist  not a philosopher 
you have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel   
   than of mending a broken nervous system 
  but what about your grandfather s work 
  my grandfather s work was doo doo 
i am not interested in death 
the only thing that concerns me
is the preservation of life 
class   
   is   
   dismissed 
 applause 
dr frankenstein

dr fronkonsteen  wake up 
what is it 
you were having a nightmare 
 faint violin music 
  what s that strange music 
  i have no idea 
but it seems to be coming   
   from behind the bookcase 
behind the bookcase   
hand me that robe  would you  dear 
you were right 
it s coming from behind this wall 
where is it 
  where is it 
  what 
there s always a device 
if i can just spot the triggering mechanism   
hello 
it seems louder over here 
hand me that candle  will you 
put    the candle    back 
all right  i think i have it figured out now 
take out the candle   
   and i ll block the bookcase with my body 
 crunch 
 high pitched voice 
listen to me very carefully 
don t put the candle back 
with all of your might   
   shove against the other side
of the bookcase 
is that    perfectly clear 
i think so 
good girl 
put    the candle    back 
oh  look  doctor  a passageway 
whatever that music is 
it s coming from down there 
  i d better take a look 
  oh  let me come with you  doctor  please 
i don t wanna stay up here alone 
all right  then 
close your robe and follow me 
oh  doctor  the candle   
good thinking  let s try this one 
stand back 
   violin continues 
 thunder crashes 
 inga gasps 
 squeaks 
don t be frightened  dear  just a rat 
a filthy  slimy rat 
 door creaks 
good lord 
oh 
    i   
  ohh 
  ain t got nobody
  and nobody cares for me
  yak a tata  yak a tata ta ta  hah 
  l gor 
  frodorick 
how did you get here 
through the dumbwaiter 
i heard the strangest music from the upstairs
kitchen and i just    followed it down 
call it    a hunch 
brrrm chee 
there must have been
someone else down here 
it would seem that way 
and there s the only other door 
wait  master 
it might be dangerous 
you go first 
aren t there any lights in this place 
two nasty iooking switches over here 
but i m not going to be the first 
well   
damn your eyes 
too late 
 inga  ohh   
so this is where it all happened 
 man  just think  a dead brain
ready to live again in a new body 
look  no blood  no decomposition 
just a few sutures 
  throw the main switch 
  yes  master 
 crackling 
what a filthy mess 
i dunno  a little paint  a few flowers 
couple of throw pillows   
well  it seems as if our mysterious violinist
has disa    p   
  disa    what 
   peared 
ssh 
 whispers  there is a light
coming from behind that door 
 whispers  follow me 
 gasps  doctor  look 
well    this explains the music 
  it s still warm 
  mm 
but who was playing it 
i don t know   
   but whoever it was just barely finished
putting out his cigar 
such strange goings on 
what is this place 
music room 
but there s nothing here
but books and papers 
books and papers 
it is 
this is my grandfather s private library 
i feel it 
look  look at this 
 heavy breathing 
 freddy   until  from the midst of this
darkness  a sudden light broke in upon me  
 a light so brilliant and wondrous 
and yet so simple  
 change the poles from plus to minus   
   and from minus to plus  
ah    ah   
 i alone succeeded in discovering
the secret of bestowing life  
 nay  even more    
 i myself    became capable
of bestowing animation   
   upon lifeless matter  
it    could    work 
 thunder crashes 
  kipper 
  mm  thank you  doctor 
 as the minuteness of the parts
formed a hindrance to my speed   
   i resolved therefore
to make the creature of a gigantic stature  
of course 
that would simplify everything 
in other words   
   his veins  his feet  his hands  his organs
would all have to be increased in size 
exactly 
he would have an enormous schwanzstück 
that goes without saying 
woof 
he s gonna be very popular 
so then   
what we re aiming for is a being
approximately seven feet in height   
   with all features either congenitally
or artificially proportionate in size 
something like   
   this 
hello   
you ve caught something there 
crude  yes  primitive  yes 
perhaps even grotesque   
   yet something inexplicable tells me   
   that this might be our man 
all right  all right 
that s good enough for the likes of  im 
get down  you fool 
now 
what a filthy job 
  could be worse 
  how 
could be raining 
 footsteps 
quick 
need a hand 
uh    no  thanks  i have one 
thanks very much all the same 
just a moment  sir 
i know everyone around here 
but i ve never seen your face before 
can you account for yourself 
yes  i am dr frederick fronkonsteen 
newly arrived from america 
oh  yes  sir  i was told you were here 
well  i m constable henry  sir 
pleased to meet you 
 freddy stamps foot 
how very nice to meet you  constable 
  why  you re chilled to the bone  sir 
  ooh 
  a nice  warm fire would be the thing for you 
  yes  yes 
a little nip from the old bottle
wouldn t be too bad either  sir 
that s the ticket  yes 
well  if you have everything in hand  sir 
i ll say good night 
thank you very much  constable 
  at your service  sir  always 
   stamps foot 
  good night  constable 
  good night  sir 
oh  what an awesome sight 
what a profound and reverend night is this 
with such a specimen for a body   
   all we need now is
an equally magnificent brain 
  you know what to do 
  i have a pretty good idea 
good man 
didn t you    didn t you use to have that
on the other side 
  what 
  your  uh   
oh  never mind 
  do you have that name i gave you 
  i have it written down 
  h delbruck 
  hans delbruck 
 thunder rumbles 
ohh 
   inga  he is hideous 
   freddy  he s beautiful 
and he is mine 
 thunder crashes 
hurry now 
we re fighting time and the elements 
  are you ready 
  are you sure this is how they did it 
yes  yes  it s all written down in the notes 
now tie off the kites
and hurry down as fast as you can 
what s the hurry 
there s a possibility of electrocution 
do you understand 
i say  there s a possibility of electrocution  
do you understand 
i understand  i understand 
why are you shouting 
did you   
  did you tie off the kites 
  of course 
oh    all right  good 
 hollow sound 
  uh    check the generator 
  yes  master 
l gor 
  release the safety valve on the main wheel 
  yes  master 
 thunder crashes 
can you imagine the brain of hans delbruck
in this body 
oh  frederick 
this is the moment 
well  dear   
are you ready 
yes  doctor 
elevate me 
now  right here 
yes  yes  raise the platform 
oh  the platform 
oh  that  ja    yes 
from that fateful day
when stinking bits of slime   
   first crawled from the sea
and shouted to the cold stars   
    i am man     
   our greatest dread has always been
the knowledge of our own mortality 
but tonight   
   we shall hurl the gauntlet of science   
   into the frightful face of death itself 
tonight   
   we shall ascend into the heavens 
we shall mock the earthquake 
we shall command the thunders   
   and penetrate   
   into the very womb
of impervious nature herself 
 thunder crashing 
 wind howling 
when i give the word 
throw the first switch 
you ve got it  master 
get ready 
get set 
go 
 electricity crackles 
throw the second switch 
throw the third switch 
not    the third switch 
throw it  i say  throw it 
life 
life  do you hear me 
give my creation   
   life 
turn everything off and bring me down 
nothing 
  oh  doctor  i m sorry   
  no  no 
be of good cheer 
if science teaches us anything   
   it teaches us to accept our failures   
   as well as our successes   
   with quiet    dignity   
   and grace 
son of a bitch  bastard  i ll get you for this 
what did you do to me 
  what did you do to me 
  doctor  doctor  stop it 
you ll kill him 
agh 
i don t wanna live 
i do not want to live 
 sobbing 
quiet dignity and grace 
ohhh  mama 
oh  tosh  this man is different  i tell you 
you can see that after you ve talked to him
for five minutes 
yes 
he s a frankenstein 
  and they re all alike 
   shouting in agreement 
it s in their blood  they can t  elp it 
all those scientists  they re all alike 
they say they re working for us 
what they really want is to rule the world 
 gavel 
that s enough now  i will not have
this meeting become a free for all 
these are very serious charges
you re making   
   and all the more painful to us  your elders 
because we still have nightmares   
   from five times before 
now    we haven t heard from the one man
most qualified to judge the situation fairly 
inspector kemp 
will you talk to us  please 
 clicking 
 hissing 
a riot    is an ugly thing   
    und once you get one started   
   there is little chance of stopping it   
   short of bloodshed 
i think    before we go around killing people   
   we had better make damn sure
of our evidence 
und   
   we had better confirm the fact   
   that young frankenstein is indeed   
   vollowing in his grandfather s vootstaps 
 all  what 
vollowing in his grandfather s vootstaps 
vootstaps 
oh  footsteps 
i think   
   what is in order   
   is for me to pay a little visit
on the good doctor   
    und to have a nice    quiet    chat 
 freddy  reputation 
reputation 
 inga  oh  doctor 
you mustn t do this to yourself 
you ve got to stop thinking about it 
why  look 
you haven t even touched your food

when these things would happen to him   
the things he d say to me 
what did he say 
what the hell are you doin

to boast and brag

 villagers  oh 
undjust who do you think you are   
   that you order these people about 
i am the monster 
ja  i see that you are the monster 
for as long as i can remember   
   people have hated me 
they looked at my face and my body   
   and they ran away in horror 
in my ioneliness  i decided that if i could not
inspire love  which was my deepest hope   
   i would instead cause fear 
 villagers gasp 
i live   
   because this poor  half crazed genius
has given me life 
he alone held an image of me   
   as something beautiful 
and then   
   when it would have been easy enough
to stay out of danger   
   he used his own body as a guinea pig   
   to give me a calmer brain   
   and a    somewhat more    sophisticated way
of expressing myself 
well  this is  of course 
an entirely different situation 
as the leader of this community   
   may i be the first to offer you my hand   
   in friendship 
 sobs 
  thank you 
  you are entirely welcome 
und now let us all go to my house
for a little sponge cake und a little wine
