in a shining castle
although he had
everything his heart desired
the prince was spoiled
selfish and unkind
but then one winters night
an old beggar woman
came to the castle
and offered him a single rose
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold
repulsed by
her haggard appearance
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away
but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances
for beauty is found within
and when he dismissed her again
the old womans ugliness
melted away
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress
the prince tried to apologize
but it was too late
for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart
and as punishment
she transformed him
into a hideous beast
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle
and all who lived there
ashamed of his monstrous form
the beast concealed himself
inside his castle
with a magic mirror
as his only window
to the outside world
the rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose
which would bloom
until his 21st year
lf he could learn
to love another
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell
then the spell would be broken
lf not he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time
as the years passed
he fell into despair
and lost all hope
for who could ever learn
to love a beast
little town
its a quiet village
every day lile the one before
little town
full of little people
waking up to say
bonjour
bonjour

such a good idea
we cant let her
go poking around
in certain places
if you know what l mean
perhaps youd like to take me
lm sure you know everything
there is to know
about the castle
oh well actually l uh
yes l do
as you can see
the pseudofacade
was stripped away
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design
note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings
this is yet another example
of the late neoclassic
baroque period
and as l always say
if its not baroque
dont fix it
uh where was l
as you were
now then if l may
draw your attention
to the flying buttresses
above the
uh mademoiselle
whats up there
where there
oh nothing
absolutely nothing
of interest at all
in the west wing
dusty dull very boring
ah so thats the west wing
nice going
l wonder what
hes hiding up there
hiding
the master is hiding nothing
then it wouldnt be forbidden
perhaps uh
mademoiselle would like to
uhuh uh see something else
we have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to
maybe later
ththe gardens oror
thethethethe library
perhaps
you have a library
yes oh indeed
with books
scads of books
mountains of books
forests of books
cascades
longboats
swamps of books
more books than youll
ever be able
to read in a lifetime
books on every subject ever
studied by every author
who ever set pen to paper
oh
why did you come here
lm lm sorry
l warned you never to come here
l didnt mean any harm
do you realize
what you could have done
please stop
get out
no
get out
where are you going
promise or no promise
l cant stay here
another minute
oh no wait please
please wait
oh
oh

oh dont do that
just hold still
that hurts
lf youd hold still
it wouldnt hurt as much
well if you hadnt
have run away
this wouldnt have happened
lf you hadnt frightened me
l wouldnt have run away
well you shouldnt have
been in the west wing
well you should learn
to control your temper
now hold still
this might sting a little
hmm
by the way thank you
for saving my life
youre welcome
l dont usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night
but he said youd make it
worth my while
ah

lve got my heart set
on marrying belle
but she needs a little
persuasion
turned him down flat
everyone knows
her fathers a lunatic
he was in here tonight
raving about a beast
in a castle
maurice is harmless
the point is
belle would do anything
to keep him
from being locked up
yeah even marry him
so you want me
to throw her father
into the asylum
unless she agrees to marry you
oh that is despicable
l love it
lf no one will help me
then lll go back alone
yes is that everything
l dont care what it takes
lll find that castle
and somehow
lll get her out of there
belle maurice
oh well
l guess its not going
to work after all
they have to come back sometime
and when they do
well be ready for them
lefou
dont move from that spot
until belle and
her father come home
but but l
aw nuts
lve never felt this way
about anyone
l want to do something for her
but what
well theres the usual things
flowers chocolates
promises you dont intend
to keep
ah no no
lt has to be something
very special
something that sparks
her interest

but first you have
to close your eyes
lts a surprise

l didnt see anything
come along chip
theres chores to be done
in the kitchen
but what are they talking about
whats going on
come on mom
theres something sweet
and almost kind
but he was mean
and he was coarse and unrefined
and now hes dear and so unsure
l wonder why l didnt see it
there before
she glanced this way
l thought l saw
and when we touched
she didnt shudder at my paw
no it cant be
lll just ignore
but then shes never looked
at me that way before
new and a bit alarming
whod have ever thought
that this could be
true that hes no
prince charming
but theres something in him
that l simply didnt see
well whod have thought
well bless my soul
well whod have known
well who indeed
and whod have guessed
theyd come together
on their own
lts so peculiar
well wait and see
a few days more
there may be something there
that wasnt there before
you know perhaps there is
something there
that wasnt there before
what
there may be something there
that wasnt there before
whats there mama
shh
lll tell you when youre older
right then
you all know why were here
we have exactly 12 hours
36 minutes and 15 seconds
to create the most magical
spontaneous romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast
or beast
right
need l remind you
that if the last petal falls
from this rose
the spell will never be
broken
very well
you all know your assignments
half of you to the west wing
half of you to the east wing
the rest of you come with me
oh lighten up cogsworth
and let nature take its course
lts obvious theres
a spark between them
yes but theres no harm
in fanning the flames
you know a little
besides they must fall in love
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again
ah human again
human again
yes think what that means
lll be cooking again
be good looking again
with a mademoiselle on each arm
when lm human again
only human again
poised and polished
and gleaming with charm
lll be courting again
chic and sporting again
which should cause
several husbands alarm
ha ha
lll hop down off this shelf
and tout de suite be myself
l cant wait to be human again
when were human again
only human again
when were knickknacks
and whatnots no more
when were human again
good and human again
oh cherie
wont it all be top drawer
lll wear lipstick and rouge
and l wont be so huge
why lll easily fit
through that door
lll exude savoir faire
lll wear gowns lll have hair
lts my prayer to be human again
when were human again
only human again
when the world once more
starts making sense
lll unwind for a change
really thatd be strange
can l help it if lm tttense
ln a shack by the sea
lll sit back sipping tea
let my early retirement commence
far from fools made of wax
lll get down to brass tacks
and relax
when lm human again
so sweep the dust from the floor
lets let some light in the room
l can feel l can tell
someone might break the spell
any day now
shine up the brass on the door
alert the dust pail and broom
lf it all goes as planned
our time may be at hand
any day now
open the shutters
and let in some air
put these here
and put those over there
sweep up the years
of sadness and tears
and throw them away
well be human again
only human again
when the girl
finally sets us all free
cheeks ablooming again
were assuming again
well resume our
long lost joie de vivre
well be playing again
holidaying again
and were praying its asap
we will push we will shove
they will both fall in love
and well finally
be human again
for never was a story
of more woe
than this of juliet
and her romeo
could you read it again
well here why dont
you read it to me
uh all right
uh
uh l cant
you mean you never learned
l learned a little
lts just been so long
well here lll help you
lets start here

two households
well be dancing again
well be twirling again
well be whirling around
with such ease
when were human again
only human again
well go waltzing
those old one two threes
well be floating again
well be gliding again
stepping striding
as fine as you please
like a real human does
lll be all that l was
on that glorious morn
when were finally reborn
and were all
human again
tonight is the night
lm not sure l can do this
you dont have time to be timid
you must be bold daring
bold daring
there will be music
romantic candlelight
provided by myself
and when the moment is right
you confess your love
yes l con
ll no l cant
you care for the girl
dont you
more than anything
well then
you must tell her
voila
oh you look so so
stupid
not quite the word
l was looking for
perhaps a little more
off the top
your lady awaits
tale as old as time
true as it can be
barely even friends
then somebody bends
unexpectedly
just a little change
small to say the least
both a little scared
neither one prepared
beauty and the beast
ever just the same
ever a surprise
huh huh huh
ever as before
ever just as sure
as the sun will rise
tale as old as time
tune as old as song
bittersweet and strange
finding you can change
learning you were wrong
certain as the sun
rising in the east
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
shh
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
