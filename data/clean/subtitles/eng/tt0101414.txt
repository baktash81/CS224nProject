in a shining castle 
although he had
everything his heart desired
the prince was spoiled 
selfish and unkind 
but then  one winter s night
an old beggar woman
came to the castle
and offered him a single rose
in return for shelter
from the bitter cold 
repulsed by
her haggard appearance
the prince sneered at the gift
and turned the old woman away
but she warned him not to be
deceived by appearances
for beauty is found within
and when he dismissed her again
the old woman s ugliness
melted away
to reveal
a beautiful enchantress 
the prince tried to apologize 
but it was too late
for she had seen that there was
no love in his heart
and as punishment 
she transformed him
into a hideous beast
and placed a powerful spell
on the castle
and all who lived there 
ashamed of his monstrous form
the beast concealed himself
inside his castle
with a magic mirror
as his only window
to the outside world 
the rose she had offered
was truly an enchanted rose
which would bloom
until his 21st year 
lf he could learn
to love another
and earn her love in return
by the time the last petal fell
then the spell would be broken 
lf not  he would be doomed
to remain a beast for all time 
as the years passed 
he fell into despair
and lost all hope
for who could ever learn
to love a beast 
little town 
it s a quiet village
every day lile the one before
little town 
full of little people
waking up    to    say   
bonjour 
  bonjour 
  bonjour 
  bonjour 
bonjour 
there goes the baker
with his tray like always
the same old bread
and rolls to sell
every morning just the same
since the morning that we came
to this poor provincial town   
good morning  belle 
good morning  monsieur 
where are you off to 
the bookshop 
l just finished
the most wonderful story
about a beanstalk
and an ogre  and   
that s nice 
marie  the baguettes 
hurry up 
look  there she goes
the girl is strange  no question
dazed and distracted 
can t you tell 
never part of any crowd
 cause her head s
up on some cloud
no denying she s a funny girl 
that belle
bonjour

 but  sir   
 l insist 
well  thank you 
thank you very much 
look  there she goes
that girl is so peculiar
l wonder if she s feeling well
with a dreamy  far off look
and her nose stuck in a book
what a puzzle to the rest
of us is belle
oh  isn t this amazing 
lt s my favorite part
because you ll see
here s where she meets
prince charming
but she won t discover
that it s him
till chapter three
hey  hey  hey  hey  hey 
now  it s no wonder
that her name means beauty
her looks have got no parallel
but behind that fair facade
l m afraid she s rather odd
very different
from the rest of us
she s nothing like
the rest of us
yes  different
from the rest of us is belle
wow  you didn t miss
a shot  gaston

even when taking your lumps
there s no man in town
as admired as you

and inspired by you
and it s not very hard
to see why
no    one s   
slick as gaston

no one s neck s
as incredibly thick as gaston
for there s no man in town
half as manly

gaston is the best
and the rest is all drips
no    one

ln a wrestling match 
nobody bites like gaston
for there s no one
as burly and brawny
as you see 
l ve got biceps to spare
not a bit of him
scraggly or scrawny
that s right
and every last inch of me s
covered with hair
no one hits like gaston
matches wits like gaston
ln a spitting match 
nobody spits like gaston
l m especially good
at expectorating
ptooey 
ten points for gaston 
when l was a lad
l ate four dozen eggs
every morning
to help me get large
and now that l m grown
l eat five dozen eggs
so l m roughly
the size of a barge
no    one   
shoots like gaston
makes those beauts like gaston
then goes tromping around
wearing boots like gaston

suddenly  those good
old days are gone
oh 
ten years we ve been rusting
needing so much more
than dusting
needing exercise
a chance to use our skills
most days we just
lay around the castle
flabby  fat and lazy
you walked in and oops a daisy 
lt s a guest  it s a guest 
sakes alive 
well  l ll be blessed
wine s been poured 
and thank the lord
l ve had the napkins
freshly pressed
with dessert  she ll want tea
and  my dear 
that s fine with me
while the cups
do their soft shoeing
l ll be bubbling 
l ll be brewing
l ll get warm  piping hot
heaven s sake  is that a spot 
clean it up  we want
the company impressed
we ve got a lot to do
ls it one lump or two 
for you  our guest
she s our guest
she s our guest
she s our guest
people  fun s over 
over here  line up   
lt s ten years since
we ve had anybody here
and we re obsessed
with your meal  with your ease
yes  indeed  we aim to please
while the candlelight s
still glowing
let us help you 
we ll keep going
course    by    course
one by one
till you shout 
  enough  l m done   
then we ll sing you
off to sleep as you digest
tonight you ll prop
your feet up
but for now  let s eat up
be our guest  be our guest
be our guest
please be our guest 
bravo 
that was wonderful 
thank you 
thank you  mademoiselle 
good show  wasn t it 
yes  everyone 
my goodness  look at the time 
now it s off to bed 
off to bed 
oh  l couldn t possibly
go to bed now 
lt s my first time
in an enchanted castle 
enchanted 
who said anything
about the castle
being enchanted 
lt was you  wasn t it 
l figured it out for myself 
l d like to look around 
if that s all right 
oh  would you like a tour 
wait a second  wait a second 
l m not sure that s
such a good idea 
we can t let her
go poking around
in certain places 
if you know what l mean 
perhaps you d like to take me 
l m sure you know everything
there is to know
about the castle 
oh  well  actually  l  uh   
yes  l do 
as you can see
the pseudo facade
was stripped away
to reveal a minimalist
rococo design 
note the unusual
inverted vaulted ceilings 
this is yet another example
of the late neoclassic
baroque period 
and  as l always say
if it s not baroque 
don t fix it 
uh  where was l 
as you were 
now  then  if l may
draw your attention
to the flying buttresses
above the   
uh  mademoiselle 
what s up there 
where  there 
oh  nothing 
absolutely nothing
of interest at all
in the west wing 
dusty  dull  very boring 
ah  so that s the west wing 
nice going 
l wonder what
he s hiding up there 
hiding 
the master is hiding nothing 
then it wouldn t be forbidden 
perhaps  uh 
mademoiselle would like to
uh uh  uh    see something else 
we have exquisite tapestries
dating all the way back to   
maybe later 
th the gardens or or
the the the the library 
perhaps 
you have a library 
yes  oh  indeed 
with books 
scads of books 
mountains of books 
forests of books 
 cascades 
 longboats 
swamps of books 
more books than you ll
ever be able
to read in a lifetime 
books on every subject ever
studied  by every author
who ever set pen to paper 
oh 
why did you come here 
l m    l m sorry 
l warned you never to come here 
l didn t mean any harm 
do you realize
what you could have done  
please  stop 
get out 
no 
get    out 
where are you going 
promise or no promise
l can t stay here
another minute 
oh  no  wait  please 
please wait 
oh 
oh 
here now 
oh  don t do that 
just hold still 
that hurts 
lf you d hold still 
it wouldn t hurt as much 
well  if you hadn t
have run away
this wouldn t have happened 
lf you hadn t frightened me 
l wouldn t have run away 
well  you shouldn t have
been in the west wing 
well  you should learn
to control your temper 
now hold still 
this might sting a little 
hmm 
by the way  thank you 
for saving my life 
you re welcome 
l don t usually leave the asylum
in the middle of the night
but he said you d make it
worth my while 
ah 
l m listening 
lt s like this 
l ve got my heart set
on marrying belle
but she needs a little   
persuasion 
turned him down flat 
everyone knows
her father s a lunatic 
he was in here tonight
raving about a beast
in a castle 
maurice is harmless 
the point is 
belle would do anything
to keep him
from being locked up 
yeah  even marry him 
so you want me
to throw her father
into the asylum
unless she agrees to marry you 
oh  that is despicable 
l love it 
lf no one will help me
then l ll go back alone 
yes  is that everything 
l don t care what it takes 
l ll find that castle 
and somehow
l ll get her out of there 
belle  maurice 
oh  well 
l guess it s not going
to work after all 
they have to come back sometime 
and when they do 
we ll be ready for them 
lefou   
don t move from that spot
until belle and
her father come home 
but  but  l   
aw  nuts 
l ve never felt this way
about anyone 
l want to do something for her 
but what 
well  there s the usual things 
flowers  chocolates 
promises you don t intend
to keep 
ah  no  no 
lt has to be something
very special 
something that sparks
her interest 
wait a minute 
belle  there s something
l want to show you 
but first  you have
to close your eyes 
lt s a surprise 
can l open them 
no  no  not yet 
wait here 
now can l open them 
all right 
now 
l can t believe it 
l ve never seen so many books
in all my life 
you you like it 
lt s wonderful 
then it s yours 
oh  thank you so much 
oh  would you look at that 
l knew it would work 
what  what worked 
lt s very encouraging 
lsn t this exciting 
l didn t see anything 
come along  chip 
there s chores to be done
in the kitchen 
but what are they talking about 
what s going on 
come on  mom 
there s something sweet
and almost kind
but he was mean 
and he was coarse and unrefined
and now he s dear  and so unsure
l wonder why l didn t see it
there before
she glanced this way
l thought l saw
and when we touched 
she didn t shudder at my paw
no  it can t be
l ll just ignore
but then she s never looked
at me that way before
new and a bit alarming
who d have ever thought
that this could be 
true that he s no
prince charming
but there s something in him
that l simply didn t see   
well  who d have thought 
well  bless my soul
well  who d have known 
well  who indeed 
and who d have guessed
they d come together
on their own 
lt s so peculiar
we ll wait and see
a few days more
there may be something there
that wasn t there before   
you know  perhaps there is
something there
that wasn t there before
what 
there may be something there
that wasn t there before 
what s there  mama 
shh 
l ll tell you when you re older 
right  then 
you all know why we re here 
we have exactly 12 hours 
36 minutes and 15 seconds
to create the most magical
spontaneous  romantic atmosphere
known to man or beast 
  or beast     
right 
need l remind you
that if the last petal falls
from this rose
the spell will never be   
broken 
very well 
you all know your assignments 
half of you to the west wing 
half of you to the east wing 
the rest of you  come with me 
oh  lighten up  cogsworth 
and let nature take its course 
lt s obvious there s
a spark between them 
yes  but there s no harm
in fanning the flames 
you know    a little 
besides  they must fall in love
tonight if we ever expect
to be human again 
ah  human again 
human again 
yes  think what that means 
l ll be cooking again
be good looking again
with a mademoiselle on each arm
when l m human again
only human again
poised and polished
and gleaming with charm
l ll be courting again
chic and sporting again
which should cause
several husbands alarm
ha  ha 
l ll hop down off this shelf
and tout de suite be myself
l can t wait to be human again
when we re human again
only human again
when we re knickknacks
and whatnots no more
when we re human again 
good and human again
oh  cherie 
won t it all be top drawer 
l ll wear lipstick and rouge
and l won t be so huge
why  l ll easily fit
through that door
l ll exude savoir faire
l ll wear gowns  l ll have hair
lt s my prayer to be human again
when we re human again
only human again
when the world once more
starts making sense
l ll unwind  for a change
really  that d be strange
can l help it if l m t t tense 
ln a shack by the sea
l ll sit back  sipping tea
let my early retirement commence
far from fools made of wax
l ll get down to brass tacks
and relax 
when l m human again
so sweep the dust from the floor
let s let some light in the room
l can feel  l can tell
someone might break the spell
any day now
shine up the brass on the door
alert the dust pail and broom
lf it all goes as planned
our time may be at hand
any day now
open the shutters 
and let in some air
put these here 
and put those over there
sweep up the years
of sadness and tears
and throw them away
we ll be human again
only human again
when the girl
finally sets us all free
cheeks a blooming again
we re assuming again
we ll resume our
long lost joie de vivre
we ll be playing again
holidaying again
and we re praying it s asap
we will push  we will shove
they will both fall in love
and we ll finally
be human again   
for never was a story
of more woe
than this of juliet
and her romeo 
could you read it again 
well  here  why don t
you read it to me 
uh  all right 
uh   
uh    l can t 
you mean  you never learned 
l learned    a little 
lt s just been so long 
well  here  l ll help you 
let s start here 
here 
okay    twoe     
  two   
  two    l knew that 
two households     
we ll be dancing again
we ll be twirling again
we ll be whirling around
with such ease
when we re human again
only human again
we ll go waltzing
those old one  two  threes
we ll be floating again
we ll be gliding again
stepping  striding
as fine as you please
like a real human does
l ll be all that l was
on that glorious morn
when we re finally reborn
and we re all
human again 
tonight is the night 
l m not sure l can do this 
you don t have time to be timid 
you must be bold  daring 
bold  daring 
there will be music   
romantic candlelight   
provided by myself 
and when the moment is right
you confess your love 
yes  l con   
l l    no  l can t 
you care for the girl 
don t you 
more than anything 
well  then 
you must tell her 
voila 
oh  you look so    so   
stupid 
not quite the word
l was looking for 
perhaps a little more
off the top 
your lady awaits 
tale as old as time
true as it can be
barely even friends
then somebody bends
unexpectedly
just a little change
small  to say the least
both a little scared
neither one prepared
beauty and the beast
ever just the same
ever a surprise
huh  huh  huh 
ever as before
ever just as sure
as the sun will rise
tale as old as time
tune as old as song
bittersweet and strange
finding you can change
learning you were wrong
certain as the sun
rising in the east
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
shh 
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast

l m afraid it s true 
she s going away 
but he was so close 
after all this time 
he s finally learned to love 
that s it  then 
that should break the spell 
but it s not enough 
she has to love him in return 
now it s too late 
papa  papa

belle

belle 
maurice  tell us again  old man

well  you don t get
much crazier than that 
lt s true  l tell you 
get him out of here 
let go of me 
no 
you can t do this 
poor belle 
lt s a shame about your father

hmm  l might be able
to clear up this   
little misunderstanding 
lf   
lf what 
lf you marry me 
what 
one little word  belle 
that s all it takes 
never 
have it your way 
belle 
let go of me 
my father s not crazy
and l can prove it 
show me the beast 
ls it dangerous 
oh  no  no 
he d never hurt anyone 
please  l know he looks vicious 
but he s really kind and gentle 
he s my friend 
lf l didn t know better
l d think you had feelings
for this monster 
he s no monster  gaston 
you are 
she s as crazy as the old man 
the beast will make off
with your children 
 he ll come after them
in the night 
 no 
we re not safe
till his head
is mounted on my wall 
l say we kill the beast 
we re not safe until he s dead
he ll come stalking us at night
set to sacrifice our children
to his monstrous appetite
he ll wreak havoc on our village
lf we let him wander free
so it s time to take
some action  boys
lt s time to follow me
through the mist 
through the woods
through the darkness
and the shadows
lt s a nightmare 
but it s one exciting ride
say a prayer  then we re there
at the drawbridge of a castle
and there s something
truly terrible inside
lt s a beast  he s got fangs 
razor sharp ones
massive paws  killer claws
for the feast
hear him roar  see him foam
but we re not coming home
till he s dead
good and dead
kill the beast 
no  l won t let you do this 
lf you re not with us 
you re against us 
bring the old man 
get your hands off me 
we can t have them running off
to warn the creature 
let us out 
we ll rid the village
of this beast 
who s with me 
raise your torch 
mount your horse
screw your courage
to the sticking place
we re counting on gaston
to lead the way
through the mist 
through the wood
where  within a haunted castle
something s lurking
that you don t see every day
lt s a beast 
one as tall as a mountain
we won t rest
till he s good and deceased
sally forth  tally ho
grab your sword  grab your bow
praise the lord  and here we go 
we ll lay siege to the castle
and bring back his head 
l have to warn the beast 
this is all my fault 
oh  papa  what are
we going to do 
now  now 
we ll think of something 
ah 
we don t like
what we don t understand
ln fact  it scares us
and this monster
is mysterious at least
bring your guns 
bring your knives
save your children
and your wives
we ll save our village
and our lives
we ll kill the beast 
l knew it 
l knew it was foolish
to get our hopes up 
maybe it would have been better
if she d never come at all 
could it be 
ls it she 
sacre bleu 
lnvaders 
encroachers 
and they have the mirror 
warn the master 
lf it s a fight they want 
we ll be ready for them 
who s with me 
ah 
take whatever booty you can find
but remember  the beast is mine 
lights ablaze  banners high
we go marching into battle
unafraid  although
the danger just increased
raise the flag  sing the song
here we come  we re 50 strong
and 50 frenchmen can t be wrong
let s kill the beast 
 pardon me  master 
 leave me in peace 
but  sir  the castle
is under attack 
kill the beast 
kill the beast 
this isn t working 
oh  lumiere 
we must do something 
wait  l know
