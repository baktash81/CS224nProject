upon time faraway land
young prince lived shining castle
although everything heart desired
prince spoiled selfish unkind
one winters night
old beggar woman came castle
offered single rose
return shelter bitter cold
repulsed haggard appearance
prince sneered gift turned old woman away
warned deceived appearances
beauty found within
dismissed
old womans ugliness melted away
reveal beautiful enchantress
prince tried apologize late
seen love heart
punishment transformed
hideous beast
placed powerful spell castle
lived
ashamed monstrous form
beast concealed inside castle
magic mirror window
outside world
rose offered truly enchanted rose
would bloom st year
lf could learn love another
earn love return time last petal fell
spell would broken
lf would doomed remain beast time
years passed fell despair
lost hope
could ever learn love beast
