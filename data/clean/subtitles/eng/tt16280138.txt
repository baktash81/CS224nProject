evolved into humans 
evolutionary biologists suggest
that dance was used by early humans
to promote the social cooperation
essential for our survival 
indeed  studies have found that
today s best dancers all share
the two specific genes associated
with excellent interpersonal skills 
but despite its power
to save our species
dance could not save
a small furniture company in miami
from the economic tsunami
of a global pandemic
so like many 40 year old
millennial white males
mike lane found himself
alone and adrift
in an ocean of failed relationships
and unrealized dreams

  let s call it 60 
  what the fuck do you do 
she said it was a silly dance

would it be a problem if i was 
no  this is 100  business 
right  you keep talking
about this  job  
but you always leave out
what the actual job is 
it s what you were meant
to be doing all along 
okay  i ve made it
really clear though
i m not    i don t dance anymore 
then i can claim that i got
magic mike s last dance 
so what else could you
possibly be paying me for 
we are not having sex 
completely out of the question 
  why 
  you know  mike
i actually think you have   
other talents  and this is
what i m invested in 
okay  but just  you know 
hear me out 
you ve purchased me
for a month  let s just say   
you say   jump   i say   which bed  
look  last night was   
kind of magical  it was amazing 
so   
let s not fuck that up 
okay 
okay 
and no  i m not  by the way 
  what 
  married 
okay 
are you in a relationship 
no  me and relationships
don t have a tendency to work out 
yeah  i can understand that 
  to freedom 
  to freedom 
now  sir  the brown hamper
is for dry cleaning
and the beige hamper
is for regular laundry 
i m probably not gonna have
any dry cleaning
and i  by the way 
i can do my own clothes  man 
just show me where the machines are 
ms  mendoza would
never allow that  sir 
aw  man  you can call me mike 
it s all good 
as you wish  sir  the loo
is through this door here 
the toilet  sir 
right  do you have any idea
what the fuck i m doing here 
regrettably  no  sir 
yeah  but you wouldn t tell me
even if you did know  would you 
i would be lying
if i said i wasn t lying  sir 
right  it s mike  man 
just call me mike 
well   mike   ms  mendoza
does love a good surprise 
i ll collect you at half past 
collect me at half past
for the surprise  cool 
shit 
i never like to give credit to victor
because he becomes unbearable   
but i wouldn t own the place
that we re going to
if he hadn t convinced me
to fight for it in the settlement 
her only other option was a sand
and gravel pit in high wycombe 
and the only value i saw in it
was that my mother in law
didn t want to give it away 
but now  i have found its purpose 
what s my purpose there 
if we re going there 
well   
just pretend that today is christmas
and you re about to open
your presents 
okay 
as a matter of fact
victor  i think we should
stop at liberty s first 
don t you think 
i would let harj know 
so that he can mentally prepare 
good idea 
what s a harj 
hello  harj 
good afternoon  madame rattigan 
don t you  madame  me
and it s mendoza now 
 french 
so where s  the big tear down  
what    this does not cost that 
what is this in dollars 
do you like   
what  do you drop a zero or   
so cute 
i m telling you  weird 
do you know what victor does 
so you own this place 
i do now 
when this very same play
opened in 2004
the owner of the theater
fell madly in love with
this horribly insecure actress 
and so   
here s where my love story
with roger began
and here is where it s going to end 
he must have loved your performance 
i had three lines 
well  you certainly look the part 
so relax  have fun
and i promise there won t be
any more surprises
but you re gonna like this one 
you swear 
  deal 
  miss mendoza 
right on time as usual 
stop it  woody 
i m half an hour late 
as usual  is this   
yeah  mike  meet woody
the best stage manager
in all of london 
easy  i m just here
to serve your vision  gov 
my vision 
your vision  let s go 
oh  fuck 
voilà 
wow 
right on time 
so what s this shit about 
it s the same old
will she marry for love
or money bullshit 
so  what does she pick 
love or money 
who cares 
the real question is
why does she feel like
she has to choose 
hell yeah 
well  this is your joint  right 
why don t you just
give them that note 
oh  this is a jolly good
waste of time  isn t it 
bravo  bravo  everybody 
absolutely flawless  thank you 
excuse me  who the fuck is talking 
oh  maxandra  my sincere apologies 
i couldn t see you in the light 
nice to see you again   
  matthew 
  right 
  the director 
  of course 
to what do we owe the pleasure 
i m here to make an announcement 
oh  oh  tell me 
well  if i only told you it wouldn t
be an announcement  would it 
i suppose not 
attention  everyone 
gang  this is maxandra rattigan 
the wife of our owner
  and   
  actually
it s maxandra mendoza
and i m the legal owner
of this theater 
i am here to give you all notice
isabel ascendant is closed   
effective immediately 
on what fucking grounds 
we are at capacity every night 
relax 
it s only
a four week course correction 
an evolution 
a revelation 
and no one is fired 
oh  christ 
except for   
  matthew 
  matthew  yes 
matthew will be replaced
by a brilliant new choreographer
that i recently discovered in miami 
his artistry made me feel   
there are no words  it s just   
ecstasy 
and in exactly one month
i want every woman
that walks into this theater
to feel the same kind
of ecstasy that i did 
to transcend 
to break free 
so  without further ado
i give you
the visionary artist that   
inspired me so profoundly
and that will take us
to the promised land 
ladies and gentlemen
michael jeffrey lane 
 sup 
the look on roger s face
when he sees this 
it s worth every pound
  every shilling 
  no  yeah  you could ve given me
just a little heads up before
you threw me to the wolves in there 
you would ve been in your head 
over thinking everything 
it was better than
not thinking anything at all  like   
and what are you so excited about 
like every single person
in there quit 
we don t need actors 
we need dancers 
plus  by not firing them
we saved thousands
on labor union fees 
more money for you 
yeah  but    okay  i   
look  no offense
but there s got to be easier ways
to get back at your husband for   
i don t know  whatever 
than putting on a strip show 
oh  i m not a scorned woman 
and this is not a strip show 
we are bringing
the tsunami to london 
okay  all right  this   
and i m down for that 
i just think that you haven t   
can t you see  people are numb 
disconnected  desensitized 
we re gonna wake them up
with a wave of passion
they ve never felt before 
okay  i just   
there s one little thing
that i think you re forgetting
is that i don t know shit
about directing theater 
  and that s why you have me 
  what 
it will be a historical 
one night collaboration
between the stage
  and the   
  the thongs 
eh  i don t know 
  exactly  that s what   
  who the hell are you 
i don t know  who are you 
zadie  what are you doing here 
this is my daughter  zadie 
oh  shit  hi  nice to meet you 
  we had a meeting  maxandra 
  yeah 
oh  my god  i m so sorry 
i completely lost track of time 
completely  i m so sorry 
i can see that  i m more interested
in why you lost track of time 
well  i ve been handling
some business
with the new director
of isabel ascendant 
michael jeffrey lane 
ah  yeah  that s not my name 
  but    it s just   
  but it s got gravitas 
yeah  it s just    it s mike lane 
  but you do need a stage name 
  are you two hooking up 
  zadie 
  well  i   
what s funny about that is   
your mom actually
is paying me to not hook up 
we are not hooking up 
but he will be staying at the house
just until he gets settled  okay 
how convenient 
tell me  mike  what do you plan
to do with act three 
yeah  we re gonna have one 
i was pl    i was planning
on doing act three
  like a   
  everybody knows
isabel ascendant has
a wildly outdated 
painfully misogynistic climax 
exactly 
and that s why our take
is going to be so exciting
because they will be expecting that
and instead  they re gonna see
that a woman can have whatever
she wants  whenever she wants it 
since when do you believe that 
since mike and i have
been exploring this theme 
yeah  your m    yeah 
we ve been exploring those themes 
you re in another one
of your phases  aren t you 
baby  don t you have
some schoolwork to do 
what s the phases thing 
every few years
she starts a big new project 
sometimes it s a charity 
a documentary
  a new best friend 
  right 
each time it s like
she s a new person 
so what 
sue me for exploring myself
and my contributions to the world 
but your contributions
never see the light of day 
there s always some obstacle 
we call her
the queen of the first act 
our therapist 
whom she stood up to be here
says she tries on these new personas
as a way from running
from the guilt about   
i already said how sorry i am
about missing that appointment
and i am going to reschedule it 
 french 
 french 
 french 
 french 
you know  pardon my french 
but y all are being rude as fuck 
sorry 
 french 
pleasure  mike 
  pleasure  zadie 
  zadie  wait  don t go 
you want some cake  baby 
what s going on 
no  i didn t know until you sent it 
well  technically 
she does have the right 
i have no idea 
maybe zadie will tell me 
change the agreement how 
mother    mother  i think
you should pursue this on your own 
i can t get dragged into a fight 
not about this  not right now 
yo 
holy shit  naysayers 
we have proof of life 
all right 
what s up  man 
i know  look  i know  i i   
and i m sorry  okay  i know
i ve been ducking you all 
i apologize  i just   
it s a long story  but i m in london
and i just want you guys to know
i m gonna be able to pay you back 
i just need a few weeks  okay 
oh  come on  man 
how many times do we have to tell you
you don t need to pay us back 
it was an investment 
i know  i know  but i m   
as many times as you guys say that 
i m not just gonna burn
my friends  money and not care 
  all right  i don t   
  no 
money is water  mike 
it flows in both directions 
that s a good point  but still 
you    yeah  hold up 
you buried the lede here 
why are you in london 
i don t know  short story is that   
i was bartending
at this charity event
and then at the end of the night
i ended up giving
this rich lady a lap dance
and now i m living
in her house in london
and gonna put on a show
at this famous theater
that she owns  so  yeah 
cool  hey  sex work is nothing
to be embarrassed about  mikey 
especially when
it s the live in kind 
hey  look  thanks  tarzan 
look  i m basically just saying
though i m gonna have your money 
i don t exactly know
what i said yes to
so i hope it works out 
mikey  mikey  this is great news 
i was looking
at your chart last night
you know you re in a once 
in 33 year jupiter cycle  right 
i    no  i didn t  but
that explains a lot i guess  yeah 
yeah  it does 
so whatever existential confusion
you re feeling right now 
it s an initiation 
it s wiping the slate clean
for you to self actualize 
i m just trying to survive
  to be honest 
  surviving  bro
you are a gig worker 
magic mike s coming back
to the main stage 
i    but that s the thing 
i m not even dancing though 
i m putting on the show 
i guess i m directing or whatever 
i mean  it s   
i m only here for a month
it s for one show only
to basically get back
at her ex or something 
i don t know 
it s totally bonkers over here 
who gives a shit  man 
she s rich  trust me 
do not leave that situation  okay 
look at me  i m basically
a freaking glorified dog walker 
okay  you just need to make sure
she doesn t wake up
and all of a sudden
want you out of the house
which i have tips on
by the way if you want them 
okay  i    we don t have dogs here 
so maybe that s a good idea 
i feel it  i feel it
in my solar plexus  brother 
this is your dharma 
  just stay in the flow 
  victor 
what are you doing there 
oh  you know  waiting
for passing fucking trade 
he s on a private call 
since when has that stopped you 
oh  boys  i miss you 
are you decent 
  yep 
  is that her 
are we interrupting something 
no  i was just looking
for some ideas 
oh  i ve been  scouting  myself 
and come take a look
at what i found 
look at that 
isn t he magnificent 
he has such an innate elegance
and intelligence to the way he moves 
and then at the same time
there s this savage thing  you know
like a primal animal 
just incredible 
i think this is
what we need for the show 
trained dancers  not strippers 
yeah  but  i mean 
as the director  i   
i promise you i know exactly
what we re looking for  yeah 
i love the way you just did that 
  what 
   as the director  
you re really owning
that place  you know 
it comes to you so naturally 
i can tell that
you already have a vision 
and i m sure that you agree
that this would be fantastic 
  yeah  he s great 
  for the show  i mean 
yeah  yeah  really  i mean  he s   
antonio is what we need 
he s great  like i said 
he s just    but he s also in italy 
  roma 
  roma  see  i can t   
i don t have time
to go find him in roma
and then bring him
all the way back here 
oh  no  that would be
out of the question 
but that s why
you have a genius producer 
he s arriving on thursday 
if you approve  creatively  i mean 
yeah  look  if you want him  sure 
i i i approve  creatively  of course 
i m so excited 
are you excited 
yeah  yeah  i am 
you don t sound excited 
i m very  very  very excited 
  i promise 
  oh  man  me  i don t even think
i m gonna be able to sleep 
no 
good night 
sweet dreams 
okay 
wait  wait  where are you going  hey 
to bed 
we got like
ten other dancers to find 
and that s why we have renata 
good night 
per your instructions
i ve assembled the top tier of talent
across multiple movement disciplines 
and they re all
very eager to please   
and quite athletic 
as you requested 
excellent work as usual  renata 
she couldn t explain
the full extent of her feelings
but max knew that she had crossed
some kind of strange rubicon 
she was desperate to know more
about why she felt this way
so she purchased a litany of books
on the history of dance 
for mike  the rattigan
had no symbolic weight
it was simply where he had to work 
and he reminded himself
in order to finish something 
you have to make a start 
for maxandra  the rattigan
had been transformed 
it went from
existing only in the past
to being a source of renewal 
  hello  hello  hello 
  hey  hey 
are you ready
to transform theater forever 
  yeah 
  yeah 
all right  calm down  calm down 
we ain t done shit yet 
all right  you guys have
all the talent in the world 
ain t no questioning that 
each and every single person here
was hand selected because they bring
something unique to the table
that we ain t never seen before 
all right 
but i have a question for you 
who here  by show of hands  has
stood in front of a thousand women
and had to get butt ass naked 
exactly 
you want to find out how fast
a group of sweet  nurturing moms can
make you just go running
cowering into a dark corner 
wishing you were never born 
i promise you it can happen 
i ve seen it  and it can happen
just like that 
now i can t believe i m about
to say these words out loud
but we got one month 
oh  yeah 
we got one month to turn y all
into the greatest group of strippers
that has ever been assembled
on planet earth 
and to do that  you boys got to be
ready to get your hands dirty
your noses wet 
and them nuts chafed as shit 
and look  if 
if we do our jobs right   
you re gonna have
a whole other problem on your hands 
you re gonna have to learn to
protect yourself in a zombie
apocalypse of repressed desire 
any questions 
i have a question 
can you  you know 
fuck a zombie to death 
or is it still a kill shot
to the head 
excuse me  what are you doing here 
i mean  you didn t
technically fire me
so i m still drawing out that salary 
oh  i m sorry 
i should have been more clear 
you re still getting paid 
but we no longer need your services 
i shouldn t have gotten my hopes up 
i was just really inspired
by our new director s vision 
what    what did i say 
he didn t say anything 
it s not what you said 
it s who you are 
do you have any idea of
how long i ve been dreaming
of someone to walk through
that door with a flame thrower
and burn this whole fucking shit
to the ground 
i can t stand playing lady isabel 
for the last six months
i ve wanted to choke the life
out of that entitled prude 
i mean  get a grip  woman 
jesus christ 
like you re rich 
send a fucking carriage to town
buy up every able bodied man 
soldier  sailor
instead of wasting your time
worrying about which boring old sod
you re going
to sign your life away to
and have a lovely half decent shag
with every last one  i   
but it s a really good job 
it s so stable  and   
so usually i don t say all of that 
well  that was poetic 
you re definitely our audience 
woody  make sure
she gets an invitation 
hey  we re still calling this
isabel ascendant  right 
yeah  but that s just a trick
to get the audience into the theater
so then we can give them
something else 
right  but if  what if we use
the actual old opening
to isabel ascendant 
i mean  it could be
a really big surprise actually 
and if i m honest   
if you want to make a show
about women getting what they want
wouldn t it be
a little fucking chauvinistic
to not have a female lead in it 
  are you calling me chauvinistic 
  no 
because i m the feminist here 
  right 
  i m the flame thrower 
this whole thing was my idea 
you heard her 
she s the flame thrower 
you re hired as isabel
because you were already hired 
i am thrilled 
thank you both so much 
will you be dancing in it 
no  just directing  right 
shame 
well  now that we have
a leading lady again
maybe the director should walk us
through the beats of the first act 
yep  first act  coming up 
enter jackson  the low class
but sexy friend of the husband  line 
harold said you didn t want
to go to calais this year 
is that still settled 
i m sick to death of calais 
  theo 
  i won t hear of it 
you re going and that s that 
perfect  hit it 
oh  come on  no    no  come on  mike 
  stop    stop 
  hey  all right  stop    stop 
stop  what s up 
they can t just start dancing
on her out of nowhere 
i mean  i m down as fuck 
okay  isn t that the point 
no  no  no 
you cannot interrupt the plot 
if you want a strong female lead 
she has to have an objective 
at least we should know
what she wants 
okay  what do you think
she wants then 
i don t know 
i know she doesn t want this life 
so she wants to run away 
she can t do that 
why  she s a free person  right 
she has a family 
there would be consequences 
right  so it s about the money 
oh  that s the least of it 
she would lose her friends 
opportunities 
her identity  her whole world
would be torn apart 
i don t know  it sounds to me
that she just needs to let go 
and some good dick 
maybe that as well 
this show is not about
getting dick  only 
she needs to solve her dilemma 
it s not like some magic unicorn
is gonna come down
and make all her wildest fantasies
come true 
what was that 
could be not the worst idea 
oh  no way 
hear me out  just    what about   
where the fuck
am i gonna get a horse 
what about a caballito 
like a tiny one 
i don t have caballito budget 
wait  what    how    okay 
what if you don t see it 
what if you don t see the horse 
no  that s not right 
no 
how long have you
been standing there 
long enough  may i 
yes 
so you ve worked with max
and this roger dude a long time 
all 18 wonderful years 
wow  so you must know these friends
that we re going to see tonight 
what are they like 
they like things
to stay the same  sir 
all right 
how do i look  and don t
give me any bullshit answer 
you know something   
they d just laugh at you in a tie 
  holy shit 
  what 
you  that suit 
you look incredibly expensive 
you have no idea 
one of the most primal feelings
human beings experience
is the desire to belong
to feel connected to other beings 
and to be part of a tribe 
in fact  brain scans have shown
that social rejection creates
virtually identical brain activity
as physical assault 
mike didn t know that
but he knew dancing could
bring people together 
even if some of those people
are snobs 
and he knew that victor was right
they would have laughed
at him in a tie 
and he says   now
that s how you wave a towel  
every time 
anyways  so  give us
the latest gossip  max 
  yeah  go on 
  and don t hold back a lick 
you know i don t hold back my licks 
  true 
  but there s nothing for me
to tell you 
you already know everything 
since you double agents
are all talking to roger 
  oh  come on 
  that s not true 
  that s not true 
  i m offended 
last i heard  he had at least
broken it off with the girl  so   
and so  she should just run
back to him then  should she 
no  that s not what i m implying 
i m just    you know 
it s something  isn t it 
  it takes time  bill 
  of course 
or have you forgotten 
ooh  hello 
thank you for your concern 
but you must know that   
i m the happiest
i ve ever been in my life 
  oh  that s really good to hear 
  oh  rubbish 
phoebe 
he can do whatever he wants 
and so can i 
  yeah 
  how modern 
but what does that actually
mean for the divorce 
the divorce  the divorce 
don t you have something else
to talk about 
i mean  besides  bill jokes 
let s have fun 
mike  why don t you tell them   
wait  no  listen to this 
you have to hear his vision
for isabel ascendant 
  oh  yeah 
  oh  yes 
uh  yeah  well  i mean
as we were talking about
we think it s   
it s very important to honor
the original source material 
  yeah  but to do that properly   
  and say no more 
it has to be a surprise 
  right 
  okay 
it s so smart to revive a classic 
  absolutely 
  that is very hot right now 
yeah  yeah  i mean  i don t know
if i would exactly call it
a classic revival  phoebe  but i   
you know  the way that i think
we were looking at it is
that it really needed to be
stripped down  oiled  and spanked 
 spanish 
  no  no   spanish 
  okay 
he loves metaphors 
so mike  is there a vibrant
theatrical community in miami 
yeah  for the right amount of dollars
i think you can have as vibrant
of a time as you would like 
i imagine you ve done
a lot of work with art basel 
no  no  i don t   
who s that  i don t know him 
  come on  guys 
  oh  my god 
of course  i know art basel 
it s the most famous art fair 
it happens in my city
every single year 
wow  your face just now   
well  i mean  if the show s
anything like him  count me in 
you better talk to him while you can
because he s about to get
super famous and super unavailable 
  wow 
  well  that s quite a build up 
  that s a deal 
  yeah 
i don t know about all that  but yes 
she is looking
unusually radiant tonight 
yeah  i guess   
i don t know  it must be good
for the soul  the whole divorce 
divorce 
yeah  i m    what 
do you guys have a different word
for the ending of a marriage here 
yeah  when it s untrue  yeah 
i mean  yes  they have
an agreement at the moment 
  yeah 
  but
i mean  that family pre nup is
going to take a decade to litigate 
  exactly 
  plus she knows
that at the end of it
she ll get absolutely nothing 
  which she ll hate 
  yeah 
what she needs is
to be able to stay with him
but not actually be with him 
that would be the golden ticket 
i wish you had gotten up 
and really taken
  your clothes off 
  okay  let s go back there 
  i d have loved to see their faces 
  i ll take my clothes off right now 
  yeah 
  they are so fake 
they are the fakest people i know 
i think the only person
that is real in my life is zadie 
she s about as real
as it gets at times 
yes  she ll tell you what she thinks 
what about you  mike 
are you real 
what do you mean  am i real 
am i    do you think i m real 
i don t know 
you know  sometimes
you kind of feel like a dream 
i mean  you look like a dream 
you smell like a dream 
you taste like a dream 
wait  i just want
to make sure  listen 
no  it s okay  no 
  no  i get it  i get it 
  no    no  wait  wait  wait  no
  that was really stupid 
  i just want to tell you    no   
  no  no  i m sorry  i didn t   
  you know what 
  i shouldn t have stopped   
  i m sorry  i m just so drunk 
what  you had  like 
one glass of wine 
  no  look  that was my fault 
  are you saying i m crazy 
no  i m definitely not saying
  you re crazy  i m saying i m sorry 
  are you telling me i m crazy 
  i didn t mean to stop you 
  this was uncalled for so obviously
  come here  i m sorry 
  if i m not drunk  i m crazy 
  stop  hey   
  and i m not crazy 
  max  stop  i m sorry 
  i am very drunk actually 
stop  stop 
  listen to my   
  no  you stop 
i don t want to listen to you 
right now  anything that you say
to me is gonna be wrong 
i already said i m sorry 
okay  i get it 
i get it  you don t have to like   
rub it in 
  all right 
  no pity talking or anything 
i get it 
can you put some music on  victor 
oh  hello  good morning 
good morning 
what are you doing up so early 
i m writing a novel 
a novel 
they make you write novels
in school over here 
do you assume that because of my age
i only have the mental capacity
to write a novel for school 
no  i just don t know anyone
that s ever written a novel 
what is it about 
it s about some people
who know each other and do things 
it s about every time i draw
another gentrified breath
into my helpless body 
and it s about 40 pages 
that s a good amount of pages 
  it is 
  how many are you gonna go for 
a few more 
  what s up  vic 
  yeah  right 
what  what  why is he like that 
if he acts like he likes you 
he hates you 
and if he acts like he hates you
it s a sign of respect
because he actually does hate you 
yeah  that s not helpful 
why doesn t he just quit 
same reason you don t quit 
systemic economic inequality 
speaking of  have you seen
maxandra this morning 
no  and why do you call her that 
you know she hates it 
she brought me from an orphanage
saying  mother 
would feel like a lie 
come on  that s a little strong 
look  she s doing the best she can 
and she loves the shit out of you 
i think the real question is
why do you love the shit out of her 
love is
a really  really big word  zadie 
and  look  the truth is
no one s believed in me
like your mom has
  so i   
  zadie 
  hi  roger 
  hello  dear 
that s your   
is your mother around 
maxandra is upstairs 
and who s this 
this is mike 
mike is the new director
for isabel ascendant 
  ah  right 
  what s up 
roger rattigan 
michael jeffrey lane 
i hope max didn t schedule to meet
both of us at the same time 
he s staying here 
well  no conflict then 
no 
i hope the theater itself
has treated you well thus far 
oh  she s been a pleasure
to be inside of 
it s got such a wonderful feel 
i m looking forward to seeing
how you improve such a classic 
i can t wait for you
to experience it 
it s a little rough  so be nice 
  okay 
  woods 
sound  go 
bravo 
bravo 
bravo  bellissimo  now that is class 
yeah  no  that was great 
yeah  i got to figure out
where it goes in the show 
but  yeah  it was    it was great 
all right  harry  let s go 
give it to her 
take your time  boy 
show her 
yep 
that s it 
hey  give her the business 
that s it  that s it 
all right  sick 
look  i mean  you can t dance
any better than that  that s perfect 
i mean  the only   
if i had a little note
it would just be
this specific dance is
a little more like fucking
than dancing 
and you know  look 
the song is called permission
so once you get permission
you got to keep it  and you got to   
the only way to do that is
to keep a connection with her 
here  watch  look  see if
you can see the difference  like   
literally you don t even
have to dance at all 
  hi 
  hey 
  can i touch you 
  of course 
  yeah  you sure 
  yeah 
woody    woody 
i don t understand 
you have
this beautiful legendary stage
but you re hovering
around the chair 
i mean  you can do the same   
over here  or your   
over there 
no woman wants
to be suffocated by testículos 
  that s fair 
  it s nice to expand  you know 
okay 
less testiculars and expansion 
some scholars suggest that dance
was once a form of communication
as integral to our daily life
as eating or sleeping 
traditionally 
tribal courtship dances
allowed dancers of opposite sexes
to engage in
socially acceptable physical contact
before they were even allowed
to speak to one another 
only when a leisure class began
to emerge out of
early economic development
did humans begin to view dance
as a source of pleasure apart
from its original purpose
to bridge people together
from different worlds
to heal wounds
when words would not suffice 
all right  you all ready 
play back 
all right  stop 
stop the music 
  stop 
  hey  excuse me
who the hell are you 
city of westminster 
historical architecture
high committee 
well  i m the owner of this theater 
is there a problem 
oh  i would think so 
anything else 
you ll be hearing from us 
we re fucked 
 the owner must obtain
written approval
 to make material changes
to property 
 if changes be made without
approval or special exemption
 the owner must restore the theater
to its original condition
and then file for approval
with the city  
this is roger trying to control me 
even though we are separated
and in the middle of a divorce
because he fucked the assistant 
i m sorry  baby 
but it s not like it s a secret 
what if we just do it anyway 
i mean  what are they
really gonna do 
 failure to comply will result
in a fine of 10 000 pounds per day
and or seizure of the property
by the city  
even if i pay the fine
he ll find a way
to exert pressure on these people
and force them to bend the rules 
that s just the way he operates 
isn t it  victor 
  well  in my opinion   
  we have to go
all the way to the top
because our freedom is an illusion 
yes  see when you start
  with no rights at all   
  so who is this person
we need to seduce
and get them on our side 
i e   the definition of corruption 
zadie  baby   
you should know
that the law is useless
when you re dealing with
entrenched male power structures 
  not all male 
  what do you mean 
edna eaglebauer 
as the chairwoman  she has the power
to grant a special exemption 
hey  z  what else
do we know about edna 
not much about her on google 
housing records indicate she s
most likely single and lives alone 
that s promising 
she s got no presence
on social media 
asides her bio
on the council website 
check if she has a pet or a hobby 
not that i can tell  she s a ghost 
i ll tell you what
this bird s got to have
a heart of stone
to shut down swan lake 
maybe  but everybody wants something 
we just got to keep looking 
what if she didn t even know
what she wants 
well  that never stopped men
from coming up with the wrong answer 
come on  guys  give me something 
victor  don t just sit there 
i ll murder her for the right price 
that might be the best idea 
but  look  this feels like
a woman s perspective
sort of a thing 
like what did you want before miami 
i just wanted to escape my life 
but then   
someone came along and gave me
this unexpected magical moment
that made me remember
who i really was 
it was like a little treasure 
okay  so we need
to figure out who edna was
before she became a bureaucrat
and tap into that then 
that s it 
  i don t understand why you don t
  i don t think   
  want suavemente  it s a great song 
  no  i love suavemente 
  it is great  i agree 
  it s a different beat 
we just don t need it right now 
look  it    look 
hear me out  it s isabel
  oh  trust me  i know it by heart 
  unicorn  champagne
  sex machine  permission  suits 
  and you know what s more important
than suavemente 
we still don t have a grand finale 
great  we ll make one 
  the most important part
  it s a group number 
  of the whole show 
  and then everybody will dance out
into the crowd  it ll be amazing 
oh  that s so random 
  everybody dancing in the crowd 
  why is that random 
we ve done that already 
it s got to be something different 
something personal 
they re all good and personal 
and they re there for a reason 
i don t    why are you
doing this right now 
why are you making it  like 
we don t have a good show 
i know  you should be dancing in it 
you have lost your mind 
what are you talking about 
  i m not dancing in the show 
  why are you saying no
to everything i say 
  have you noticed that 
  i m not saying no  i ve said yes
  on every single part of the show 
  we need something
climactic  different
  something personal 
  all right  i m   
  give me something
  great
  that i don t know about you 
  then do something personal 
why is it about me 
this is about women 
you re a woman  i m not 
i m not gonna be dancing in the show 
why don t you make it personal 
well  do whatever you want 
do the thing that you and
antonio have been making 
it s great 
that s personal  ain t it 
hey  it s your show 
give me something that s yours 
open up 
  i did 
  when 
the whole    this whole time 
and if you haven t seen it  i don t
know what to tell you about it 
well  i don t know
what to tell you about it
since i tried to kiss you
and you pulled away 
you don t know how to open up 
that s why you need the suavemente 
oh  still waiting for
passing trade  you nosy fuck 
your turn  he s impossible 
yes  victor 
i did not say anything 
yeah  yeah  you re always
saying something in your head 
just say it out loud  man 
you see  the problem with max is
she tends to overcomplicate things 
yeah 
especially when she knows
exactly what she wants 
and she knows exactly what she wants
when it comes to you 
why do you work for her 
you could easily work for roger 
she s got bigger balls 
listen  motherfucker 
  i rest my case 
  yeah 
  you better make up your mind
  oh  just   
  because you re driving me crazy 
  yeah  you re driving me crazy 
what are you doing 
just stop 
  okay  just shut up 
  no  you stop 
you shut up 
i just want a happy ending 
 spanish 
you re an insane person 
you know that  right 
 spanish 
 spanish 
 spanish 
given the debate and confusion
around the word  love  generally
what are we to make
of the word  love 
in the context of dancing 
if you love dancing with someone
does that mean on some level
that you love them 
what other feelings are
exchanged during a dance 
can you dance
with someone you don t trust 
should you trust someone
just because they can dance 
max and mike weren t
thinking about this
but they should have been 
stop the music 
stop the music  stop the music 
  edna 
  edna 
i am so sorry  ms  mendoza 
i m so deeply sorry to each and
every one of you beautiful creatures 
sorry for what 
height restrictions for stage risers 
apparently  your new stage is
three quarters of an inch too high 
your exemption has been denied 
you re to shut down immediately 
but you had already approved it 
i got a call
from an mp s office  it s law 
there s nothing i can do 
keep working 
i ll take care of this 
i ll be right back 
okay 
how fucking dare you 
you re not shutting me down again 
not this time 
max  i sincerely want
to rebuild our trust 
in the meantime  i m just trying
to look out for you 
how is shutting down my show
looking out for me 
i m not talking about the show 
then what are you talking about 
i m talking about your judgment 
i m talking
what i witnessed in the kitchen
in front of our daughter 
roger  i wouldn t get into a dispute
about judgment with me right now 
you handed my family s theater
over to a fucking stripper 
you don t know anything about mike 
i know when you re being used 
don t you see that 
no 
darling  i know we re all getting old
but i didn t know
you were so desperate 
fuck you  we care for each other 
max  have you even read
our settlement agreement 
the language about denigrating
or harming the family brand 
the moment that show goes up
mother s barristers will be clawing
back every last shilling in court
and i won t be able to stop her 
but if you re still too deluded
to help yourself
please be mindful of zadie 
she shouldn t have to pay
the price for your fantasies 
would you please stop it 
what 
i know what you re thinking 
you re thinking 
 what was she thinking  
you weren t thinking  were you 
you were falling in love 
oh  shut the fuck up 
you think i don t know that 
and don t you dare judge me 
you were not there 
that one fucking dance   
changed everything in me 
it feels like it made me
the best version of myself
but everybody s laughing at me 
i m a joke  an embarrassment 
not to him though 
he believes in me 
and i have to go tell him
that our show about
empowering women is dead
because i m so fucking powerless 
the most frightening part is that
i m about to find out
if that dance meant
as much to him as it did to me 
or if i m just
another goddamn tuesday 
no  you re more like
a thursday  madame 
have i always been this adolescent 
no 
only when it s raining 
one  two  three  four 
five  six  seven  eight 
one 
mike 
jack  keep taking them through 
what the fuck you mean  we re done  
i m sorry  i did my best 
but i failed 
  wait  what    all right 
  victor will come back
and pick you up
and he can arrange
a flight for you tomorrow 
no  no  no  what happened 
this isn t you 
what the fuck

you really are the queen of
the first act  huh  holy shit 
you don t know anything about me 
and you don t understand anything 
it s friday 
they wouldn t pull the plug
on us until monday 
but you re walking away 
you have no show 
you couldn t even come up
with an ending 
you cannot say that what we ve
created so far isn t fucking special 
you cannot say that 
i know you can t 
i m sorry  but
we re gonna have to let it go 
you ll still get paid 
hey  hey  look  i don t
give a fuck about the money 
i don t fucking care 
okay 
we re good at this and i m not gonna
fucking just let us give up on it 
you re so good at this

what you were good at  did he 
don t let this be the end 
  woody 
  lay it on me  gov 
i need a plumber and a ballerina 
the princess is on a hunger strike 
won t even open the door 
what  she s not even drinking 
i m afraid not 
did you try using
your  wise british butler  voice 
trust me  i went full metal
downton abbey on her ass 
and if that bloke doesn t
pull his head from his own ass
you ll be parented
from behind a closed door
for months  years  even 
but you didn t tell her
you slipped mike the keys 
please 
if the lawyers found out
her careless manservant
failed to lock the rattigan doors 
she ll need plausible deniability 
if there s anything i ve learned
it s that you can t tell
people anything 
they have to have an experience 
message from mike 
 end is not ending 
 sunday at seven we roll 
the grand finale  
let me see that 
crikey  it s a haiku 
seventeen syllables

mom

here you go  there 
victor 
the rumors about the show were
a form of entertainment for some 
but for the two people who created it
the terror of the opening night
could only be managed
by remembering
there would be no record of it 
only the people who were there
would ever experience
the story of max and mike
as told through dance 
there s small ships 
there s tall ships
there re ships that sail the sea
there s no ships like friendships
so here s to you and me 
one  two  three 
let s go 
we are strippers 
all right  man 
  let s go 
  yes 
break a leg  everyone 
alex  cue one and sound  go 
the light is different 
it s november  it s lower 
harold s worried about lunch 
he said the menu is diabolical 
the menu is diabolical 
how can a menu be diabolical 
only a person can be diabolical 
a menu isn t alive 
well  either way  he s worried 
and you re worried about him 
i don t envy him finding out 
  well  i ll tell him 
  isabel  no  it s impossible

harold

well  that depends on
what your definition of okay is  but
first things first
why don t you tell us
how you really feel 
well   
i don t know 
these two guys shouldn t be
my only two options in the world
should they 
i mean
why do i need to feel like i choose 
like  it s between
the shitty rich guy
and the poor guy
with a heart of gold 
i mean  come on
all i really want right now is
to tell these boring bags of dicks
to leave me alone 
that s right  lady isabel 
see  i m here to tell you that
you can have anything you want 
all you have to do is ask 
what 
okay  really 
  really 
  okay 
well  i am a modest lady  so   
what if all i wanted was just a guy
in a tank top and some jeans 
okay  well
if i can have that then
what about a bad boy   
hold up  hold up
who always responds to my texts 
all right 
and now 
if i can have that then   
a sexy ceo who pays his women
more than his men 
ooh  me ow 
what about a guy with a puppy 
okay  let me just swallow my saliva
that s literally dripping out
of my mouth right now 
if i could have all of that 
why stop there 
wait a minute 
i can t be the only person
in this room
to feel what i m feeling
right now  am i 
no 
i didn t think so 
i can tell by the looks
on your faces 
now i want every single one
of you to know
how i m feeling
right this very second 
i managed to have
a little bit of everything 
and now  it s your turn 
so  by the power vested in me
through this magic mike
i command thee  unicorn 
send everything to us all
right now 
hey 
single ladies  i can t hear ya 
single ladies  make noise 
what s your zodiac sign 
what s your zodiac sign 
what s your zodiac sign 
how do you feel about
your new reality  everybody 
make some bloody noise 
give it up  give it up
for these gorgeous lads
who busted into a sweat
just for all of you 
come on  make a little noise 
yeah    yeah 
that s what i like to hear 
that s what i love to hear 
a little bit of noise on this stage
doesn t go amiss  sweethearts 
and let me tell you one thing
a body at rest   
is a body at rest  right 
eh  you know  not bad 
but a body in motion   
there is absolutely nothing sexier
than a body in motion  am i right 
so for our next act
i want you to give it up 
ladies and gentlemen
for the trickster prince
him bloody self 
give it up  everybody 
for mr  jd rainey 
i think we should leave now 
where are we going 
mike said to leave
at the end of suits
and return at the end of pony 
oh  yes  yes  so you go 
and no peeking 
he ll be watching you 
now folks  this next dance
is one that i m well acquainted with 
things are about to get intimate 
now  a real man isn t afraid
to act on his desire   
but the sexiest act of submission   
is asking for permission 
break a leg  gov 
aw  bless ya 
i know  i know 
we all want
a little bit of everything
all of the time  don t we 
but   
sometimes   
you just want to be
everything to someone  right 
sometimes   
the greatest fantasy of them all   
is knowing that you re the only one 
you said to go hard 
and so i did what you said 
i mean  you know 
  oh  god 
  we showed up 
that s pony 
mike said after pony 
no  he just said pony 
he definitely said after pony
and they re still
on their ponies  now sit 
yes 
come on  they re applauding 
it must be over now 
very well 
so amazing 
wait a minute  just a second 
thank you very much  mr  mike 
very nice  my friend 
  you look beautiful 
  congratulations 
  huh 
  congratulations 
  you did it 
  what are you talking about 
  we did it  look around 
  you did it  it was amazing 
  all this is because of you 
  you are sublime 
look  i just want you to know
i love you  okay 
wait    wait 
if you re not gonna leave him
i don t want this
to be more confusing 
it s done 
i m never  ever  ever
going back to him 
i am free and i am broke 
what do you mean  you re   
what do you mean you re broke 
  yeah 
  like broke  broke 
i m s    i m sorry 
  i m so sorry 
  it s okay  i don t care 
no  i m    i m just   
i m sorry  i m sorry 
i hate you 
come on  let s go 
no one can claim to fully understand
what exactly dance is
but what is abundantly clear
is that dance seeks
no meaning for its desires 
it does not value age
or status  logic or reason 
it is a compass orientated
