evolved into humans
evolutionary biologists suggest
that dance was used by early humans
to promote the social cooperation
essential for our survival
indeed studies have found that
todays best dancers all share
the two specific genes associated
with excellent interpersonal skills
but despite its power
to save our species
dance could not save
a small furniture company in miami
from the economic tsunami
of a global pandemic
so like many 40yearold
millennial white males
mike lane found himself
alone and adrift
in an ocean of failed relationships
and unrealized dreams

then i can claim that i got
magic mikes last dance
so what else could you

i actually think you have
other talents and this is
what im invested in

is for dry cleaning
and the beige hamper

im probably not gonna have
any dry cleaning
and i by the way
i can do my own clothes man

ms mendoza would
never allow that sir
aw man you can call me mike
its all good
as you wish sir the loo
is through this door here
the toilet sir
right do you have any idea
what the fuck im doing here
regrettably no sir
yeah but you wouldnt tell me
even if you did know would you
i would be lying
if i said i wasnt lying sir
right its mike man
just call me mike
well mike ms mendoza
does love a good surprise
ill collect you at half past
collect me at half past
for the surprise cool
shit
i never like to give credit to victor
because he becomes unbearable
but i wouldnt own the place
that were going to
if he hadnt convinced me
to fight for it in the settlement
her only other option was a sand
and gravel pit in high wycombe
and the only value i saw in it
was that my motherinlaw
didnt want to give it away
but now i have found its purpose
whats my purpose there
if were going there
well
just pretend that today is christmas
and youre about to open
your presents
okay
as a matter of fact
victor i think we should
stop at libertys first
dont you think
i would let harj know
so that he can mentally prepare
good idea
whats a harj
hello harj
good afternoon madame rattigan
dont you madame me
and its mendoza now
french
so wheres the big teardown
what this does not cost that
what is this in dollars
do you like
what do you drop a zero or
so cute
im telling you weird
do you know what victor does
so you own this place
i do now
when this very same play
opened in 2004
the owner of the theater
fell madly in love with
this horribly insecure actress
and so
heres where my love story
with roger began
and here is where its going to end
he must have loved your performance
i had three lines
well you certainly look the part
so relax have fun
and i promise there wont be
any more surprises
but youre gonna like this one
you swear
deal
miss mendoza
right on time as usual
stop it woody
im half an hour late
as usual is this
yeah mike meet woody
the best stage manager
in all of london
easy im just here
to serve your vision gov
my vision
your vision lets go
oh fuck
voil√†
wow
right on time
so whats this shit about
its the same old
willshemarryforlove
ormoney bullshit
so what does she pick
love or money
who cares
the real question is
why does she feel like
she has to choose
hell yeah
well this is your joint right
why dont you just
give them that note
oh this is a jolly good
waste of time isnt it
bravo bravo everybody
absolutely flawless thank you
excuse me who the fuck is talking
oh maxandra my sincere apologies
i couldnt see you in the light
nice to see you again
matthew
right
the director
of course
to what do we owe the pleasure
im here to make an announcement
oh oh tell me
well if i only told you it wouldnt
be an announcement would it
i suppose not
attention everyone
gang this is maxandra rattigan
the wife of our owner
and
actually
its maxandra mendoza
and im the legal owner
of this theater
i am here to give you all notice
isabel ascendant is closed
effective immediately
on what fucking grounds
we are at capacity every night
relax
its only
a fourweek course correction
an evolution
a revelation
and no one is fired
oh christ
except for
matthew
matthew yes
matthew will be replaced
by a brilliant new choreographer
that i recently discovered in miami
his artistry made me feel
there are no words its just
ecstasy
and in exactly one month
i want every woman
that walks into this theater
to feel the same kind
of ecstasy that i did
to transcend
to break free
so without further ado
i give you
the visionary artist that
inspired me so profoundly
and that will take us
to the promised land
ladies and gentlemen
michael jeffrey lane
sup
the look on rogers face
when he sees this
its worth every pound
every shilling
no yeah you couldve given me
just a little headsup before
you threw me to the wolves in there
you wouldve been in your head
overthinking everything
it was better than
not thinking anything at all like
and what are you so excited about
like every single person
in there quit
we dont need actors
we need dancers
plus by not firing them
we saved thousands
on laborunion fees
more money for you
yeah but okay i
look no offense
but theres got to be easier ways
to get back at your husband for
i dont know whatever
than putting on a strip show
oh im not a scorned woman
and this is not a strip show
we are bringing
the tsunami to london
okay all right this
and im down for that
i just think that you havent
cant you see people are numb
disconnected desensitized
were gonna wake them up
with a wave of passion
theyve never felt before
okay i just
theres one little thing
that i think youre forgetting
is that i dont know shit
about directing theater
and thats why you have me
what
it will be a historical
onenight collaboration
between the stage
and the
the thongs
eh i dont know
exactly thats what
who the hell are you
i dont know who are you
zadie what are you doing here
this is my daughter zadie
oh shit hi nice to meet you
we had a meeting maxandra
yeah
oh my god im so sorry
i completely lost track of time
completely im so sorry
i can see that im more interested
in why you lost track of time
well ive been handling
some business
with the new director
of isabel ascendant
michael jeffrey lane
ah yeah thats not my name
but its just
but its got gravitas
yeah its just its mike lane
but you do need a stage name
are you two hooking up
zadie
well i
whats funny about that is
your mom actually
is paying me to not hook up
we are not hooking up
but he will be staying at the house
just until he gets settled okay
how convenient
tell me mike what do you plan
to do with act three
yeah were gonna have one
i was pl i was planning
on doing act three
like a
everybody knows
isabel ascendant has
a wildly outdated
painfully misogynistic climax
exactly
and thats why our take
is going to be so exciting
because they will be expecting that
and instead theyre gonna see
that a woman can have whatever
she wants whenever she wants it
since when do you believe that
since mike and i have
been exploring this theme
yeah your m yeah
weve been exploring those themes
youre in another one
of your phases arent you
baby dont you have
some schoolwork to do
whats the phases thing
every few years
she starts a big new project
sometimes its a charity
a documentary
a new best friend
right
each time its like
shes a new person
so what
sue me for exploring myself
and my contributions to the world
but your contributions
never see the light of day
theres always some obstacle
we call her
the queen of the first act
our therapist
whom she stood up to be here
says she tries on these new personas
as a way from running
from the guilt about
i already said how sorry i am
about missing that appointment
and i am going to reschedule it
french
french
french
french
you know pardon my french
but yall are being rude as fuck
sorry
french
pleasure mike
pleasure zadie
zadie wait dont go
you want some cake baby
whats going on
no i didnt know until you sent it
well technically
she does have the right
i have no idea
maybe zadie will tell me
change the agreement how
mother mother i think
you should pursue this on your own
i cant get dragged into a fight
not about this not right now
yo
holy shit naysayers
we have proof of life
all right
whats up man
i know look i know ii
and im sorry okay i know
ive been ducking you all
i apologize i just
its a long story but im in london
and i just want you guys to know
im gonna be able to pay you back
i just need a few weeks okay
oh come on man
how many times do we have to tell you
you dont need to pay us back
it was an investment
i know i know but im
as many times as you guys say that
im not just gonna burn
my friends money and not care
all right i dont
no
money is water mike
it flows in both directions
thats a good point but still
you yeah hold up
you buried the lede here
why are you in london
i dont know short story is that
i was bartending
at this charity event
and then at the end of the night
i ended up giving
this rich lady a lap dance
and now im living
in her house in london
and gonna put on a show
at this famous theater
that she owns so yeah
cool hey sex work is nothing
to be embarrassed about mikey
especially when
its the livein kind
hey look thanks tarzan
look im basically just saying
though im gonna have your money
i dont exactly know
what i said yes to
so i hope it works out
mikey mikey this is great news
i was looking
at your chart last night
you know youre in a once
in33year jupiter cycle right
i no i didnt but
that explains a lot i guess yeah
yeah it does
so whatever existential confusion
youre feeling right now
its an initiation
its wiping the slate clean
for you to selfactualize
im just trying to survive
to be honest
surviving bro
you are a gig worker
magic mikes coming back
to the main stage
i but thats the thing
im not even dancing though
im putting on the show
i guess im directing or whatever
i mean its
im only here for a month
its for one show only
to basically get back
at her ex or something
i dont know
its totally bonkers over here
who gives a shit man
shes rich trust me
do not leave that situation okay
look at me im basically
a freaking glorified dog walker
okay you just need to make sure
she doesnt wake up
and all of a sudden
want you out of the house
which i have tips on
by the way if you want them
okay i we dont have dogs here
so maybe thats a good idea
i feel it i feel it
in my solar plexus brother
this is your dharma
just stay in the flow
victor
what are you doing there
oh you know waiting
for passing fucking trade
hes on a private call
since when has that stopped you
oh boys i miss you
are you decent
yep
is that her
are we interrupting something
no i was just looking
for some ideas
oh ive been scouting myself
and come take a look
at what i found
look at that
isnt he magnificent
he has such an innate elegance
and intelligence to the way he moves
and then at the same time
theres this savage thing you know
like a primal animal
just incredible
i think this is
what we need for the show
trained dancers not strippers
yeah but i mean
as the director i
i promise you i know exactly
what were looking for yeah
i love the way you just did that
what
as the director
youre really owning
that place you know
it comes to you so naturally
i can tell that
you already have a vision
and im sure that you agree
that this would be fantastic
yeah hes great
for the show i mean
yeah yeah really i mean hes
antonio is what we need
hes great like i said
hes just but hes also in italy
roma
roma see i cant
i dont have time
to go find him in roma
and then bring him
all the way back here
oh no that would be
out of the question
but thats why
you have a genius producer
hes arriving on thursday
if you approve creatively i mean
yeah look if you want him sure
iii approve creatively of course
im so excited
are you excited
yeah yeah i am
you dont sound excited
im very very very excited
i promise
oh man me i dont even think
im gonna be able to sleep
no
good night
sweet dreams
okay
wait wait where are you going hey
to bed
we got like
ten other dancers to find
and thats why we have renata
good night
per your instructions
ive assembled the toptier of talent
across multiple movement disciplines
and theyre all
very eager to please
and quite athletic
as you requested
excellent work as usual renata
she couldnt explain
the full extent of her feelings
but max knew that she had crossed
some kind of strange rubicon
she was desperate to know more
about why she felt this way
so she purchased a litany of books
on the history of dance
for mike the rattigan
had no symbolic weight
it was simply where he had to work
and he reminded himself
in order to finish something
you have to make a start
for maxandra the rattigan
had been transformed
it went from
existing only in the past
to being a source of renewal
hello hello hello
hey hey
are you ready
to transform theater forever
yeah
yeah
all right calm down calm down
we aint done shit yet
all right you guys have
all the talent in the world
aint no questioning that
each and every single person here
was hand selected because they bring
something unique to the table
that we aint never seen before
all right
but i have a question for you
who here by show of hands has
stood in front of a thousand women
and had to get buttass naked
exactly
you want to find out how fast
a group of sweet nurturing moms can
make you just go running
cowering into a dark corner
wishing you were never born
i promise you it can happen
ive seen it and it can happen
just like that
now i cant believe im about
to say these words out loud
but we got one month
oh yeah
we got one month to turn yall
into the greatest group of strippers
that has ever been assembled
on planet earth
and to do that you boys got to be
ready to get your hands dirty
your noses wet
and them nuts chafed as shit
and look if
if we do our jobs right
youre gonna have
a whole other problem on your hands
youre gonna have to learn to
protect yourself in a zombie
apocalypse of repressed desire
any questions
i have a question
can you you know
fuck a zombie to death
or is it still a kill shot
to the head
excuse me what are you doing here
i mean you didnt
technically fire me
so im still drawing out that salary
oh im sorry
i should have been more clear
youre still getting paid
but we no longer need your services
i shouldnt have gotten my hopes up
i was just really inspired
by our new directors vision
what what did i say
he didnt say anything
its not what you said
its who you are
do you have any idea of
how long ive been dreaming
of someone to walk through
that door with a flame thrower
and burn this whole fucking shit
to the ground
i cant stand playing lady isabel
for the last six months
ive wanted to choke the life
out of that entitled prude
i mean get a grip woman
jesus christ
like youre rich
send a fucking carriage to town
buy up every ablebodied man
soldier sailor
instead of wasting your time
worrying about which boring old sod
youre going
to sign your life away to
and have a lovely halfdecent shag
with every last one i
but its a really good job
its so stable and
so usually i dont say all of that
well that was poetic
youre definitely our audience
woody make sure
she gets an invitation
hey were still calling this
isabel ascendant right
yeah but thats just a trick
to get the audience into the theater
so then we can give them
something else
right but if what if we use
the actual old opening
to isabel ascendant
i mean it could be
a really big surprise actually
and if im honest
if you want to make a show
about women getting what they want
wouldnt it be
a little fucking chauvinistic
to not have a female lead in it
are you calling me chauvinistic
no
because im the feminist here
right
im the flamethrower
this whole thing was my idea
you heard her
shes the flamethrower
youre hired as isabel
because you were already hired
i am thrilled
thank you both so much
will you be dancing in it
no just directing right
shame
well now that we have
a leading lady again
maybe the director should walk us
through the beats of the first act
yep first act coming up
enter jackson the lowclass
but sexy friend of the husband line
harold said you didnt want
to go to calais this year
is that still settled
im sick to death of calais
theo
i wont hear of it
youre going and thats that
perfect hit it
oh come on no no come on mike
stop stop
hey all right stop stop
stop whats up
they cant just start dancing
on her out of nowhere
i mean im down as fuck
okay isnt that the point
no no no
you cannot interrupt the plot
if you want a strong female lead
she has to have an objective
at least we should know
what she wants
okay what do you think
she wants then
i dont know
i know she doesnt want this life
so she wants to run away
she cant do that
why shes a free person right
she has a family
there would be consequences
right so its about the money
oh thats the least of it
she would lose her friends
opportunities
her identity her whole world
would be torn apart
i dont know it sounds to me
that she just needs to let go
and some good dick
maybe that as well
this show is not about
getting dick only
she needs to solve her dilemma
its not like some magic unicorn
is gonna come down
and make all her wildest fantasies
come true
what was that
could be not the worst idea
oh no way
hear me out just what about
where the fuck
am i gonna get a horse
what about a caballito
like a tiny one
i dont have caballito budget
wait what how okay
what if you dont see it
what if you dont see the horse
no thats not right
no
how long have you
been standing there
long enough may i
yes
so youve worked with max
and this roger dude a long time
all 18 wonderful years
wow so you must know these friends
that were going to see tonight
what are they like
they like things
to stay the same sir
all right
how do i look and dont
give me any bullshit answer
you know something
theyd just laugh at you in a tie
holy shit
what
you that suit
you look incredibly expensive
you have no idea
one of the most primal feelings
human beings experience
is the desire to belong
to feel connected to other beings
and to be part of a tribe
in fact brain scans have shown
that social rejection creates
virtually identical brain activity
as physical assault
mike didnt know that
but he knew dancing could
bring people together
even if some of those people
are snobs
and he knew that victor was right
they would have laughed
at him in a tie
and he says now
thats how you wave a towel
every time
anyways so give us
the latest gossip max
yeah go on
and dont hold back a lick
you know i dont hold back my licks
true
but theres nothing for me
to tell you
you already know everything
since you double agents
are all talking to roger
oh come on
thats not true
thats not true
im offended
last i heard he had at least
broken it off with the girl so
and so she should just run
back to him then should she
no thats not what im implying
im just you know
its something isnt it
it takes time bill
of course
or have you forgotten
ooh hello
thank you for your concern
but you must know that
im the happiest
ive ever been in my life
oh thats really good to hear
oh rubbish
phoebe
he can do whatever he wants
and so can i
yeah
how modern
but what does that actually
mean for the divorce
the divorce the divorce
dont you have something else
to talk about
i mean besides bill jokes
lets have fun
mike why dont you tell them
wait no listen to this
you have to hear his vision
for isabel ascendant
oh yeah
oh yes
uh yeah well i mean
as we were talking about
we think its
its very important to honor
the original source material
yeah but to do that properly
and say no more
it has to be a surprise
right
okay
its so smart to revive a classic
absolutely
that is very hot right now
yeah yeah i mean i dont know
if i would exactly call it
a classic revival phoebe but i
you know the way that i think
we were looking at it is
that it really needed to be
stripped down oiled and spanked
spanish
no no spanish
okay
he loves metaphors
so mike is there a vibrant
theatrical community in miami
yeah for the right amount of dollars
i think you can have as vibrant
of a time as you would like
i imagine youve done
a lot of work with art basel
no no i dont
whos that i dont know him
come on guys
oh my god
of course i know art basel
its the most famous art fair
it happens in my city
every single year
wow your face just now
well i mean if the shows
anything like him count me in
you better talk to him while you can
because hes about to get
super famous and super unavailable
wow
well thats quite a buildup
thats a deal
yeah
i dont know about all that but yes
she is looking
unusually radiant tonight
yeah i guess
i dont know it must be good
for the soul the whole divorce
divorce
yeah im what
do you guys have a different word
for the ending of a marriage here
yeah when its untrue yeah

oh hello good morning
good morning
what are you doing up so early
im writing a novel
a novel
they make you write novels
in school over here
do you assume that because of my age
i only have the mental capacity
to write a novel for school
no i just dont know anyone
thats ever written a novel
what is it about
its about some people
who know each other and do things
its about every time i draw
another gentrified breath
into my helpless body
and its about 40 pages
thats a good amount of pages
it is
how many are you gonna go for
a few more
whats up vic
yeah right
what what why is he like that
if he acts like he likes you
he hates you
and if he acts like he hates you
its a sign of respect
because he actually does hate you
yeah thats not helpful
why doesnt he just quit
same reason you dont quit
systemic economic inequality
speaking of have you seen
maxandra this morning
no and why do you call her that
you know she hates it
she brought me from an orphanage
saying mother
would feel like a lie
come on thats a little strong
look shes doing the best she can
and she loves the shit out of you
i think the real question is
why do you love the shit out of her
love is
a really really big word zadie
and look the truth is
no ones believed in me
like your mom has
so i
zadie
hi roger
hello dear
thats your
is your mother around
maxandra is upstairs
and whos this
this is mike
mike is the new director
for isabel ascendant
ah right
whats up
roger rattigan
michael jeffrey lane
i hope max didnt schedule to meet
both of us at the same time
hes staying here
well no conflict then
no
i hope the theater itself
has treated you well thus far
oh shes been a pleasure
to be inside of
its got such a wonderful feel
im looking forward to seeing
how you improve such a classic
i cant wait for you
to experience it
its a little rough so be nice
okay
woods
sound go
bravo
bravo
bravo bellissimo now that is class
yeah no that was great
yeah i got to figure out
where it goes in the show
but yeah it was it was great
all right harry lets go
give it to her
take your time boy
show her
yep
thats it
hey give her the business
thats it thats it
all right sick
look i mean you cant dance
any better than that thats perfect
i mean the only
if i had a little note
it would just be
this specific dance is
a little more like fucking
than dancing
and you know look
the song is called permission
so once you get permission
you got to keep it and you got to
the only way to do that is
to keep a connection with her
here watch look see if
you can see the difference like
literally you dont even
have to dance at all
hi
hey
can i touch you
of course
yeah you sure
yeah
woody woody
i dont understand
you have
this beautiful legendary stage
but youre hovering
around the chair
i mean you can do the same
over here or your
over there
no woman wants
to be suffocated by test√≠culos
thats fair
its nice to expand you know
okay
less testiculars and expansion
some scholars suggest that dance
was once a form of communication
as integral to our daily life
as eating or sleeping
traditionally
tribal courtship dances
allowed dancers of opposite sexes
to engage in
socially acceptable physical contact
before they were even allowed
to speak to one another
only when a leisure class began
to emerge out of
early economic development
did humans begin to view dance
as a source of pleasure apart
from its original purpose
to bridge people together
from different worlds
to heal wounds
when words would not suffice
all right you all ready
play back
all right stop
stop the music
stop
hey excuse me
who the hell are you
city of westminster
historical architecture
high committee
well im the owner of this theater
is there a problem
oh i would think so
anything else
youll be hearing from us
were fucked
the owner must obtain
written approval
to make material changes
to property
if changes be made without
approval or special exemption
the owner must restore the theater
to its original condition
and then file for approval
with the city
this is roger trying to control me
even though we are separated
and in the middle of a divorce
because he fucked the assistant
im sorry baby
but its not like its a secret
what if we just do it anyway
i mean what are they
really gonna do
failure to comply will result
in a fine of 10000 pounds per day
andor seizure of the property
by the city
even if i pay the fine
hell find a way
to exert pressure on these people
and force them to bend the rules
thats just the way he operates
isnt it victor
well in my opinion
we have to go
all the way to the top
because our freedom is an illusion
yes see when you start
with no rights at all
so who is this person
we need to seduce
and get them on our side
ie the definition of corruption
zadie baby
you should know
that the law is useless
when youre dealing with
entrenched male power structures
not all male
what do you mean
edna eaglebauer
as the chairwoman she has the power
to grant a special exemption
hey z what else
do we know about edna
not much about her on google
housing records indicate shes
most likely single and lives alone
thats promising
shes got no presence
on social media
asides her bio
on the council website
check if she has a pet or a hobby
not that i can tell shes a ghost
ill tell you what
this birds got to have
a heart of stone
to shut down swan lake
maybe but everybody wants something
we just got to keep looking
what if she didnt even know
what she wants
well that never stopped men
from coming up with the wrong answer
come on guys give me something
victor dont just sit there
ill murder her for the right price
that might be the best idea
but look this feels like
a womans perspective
sort of a thing
like what did you want before miami
i just wanted to escape my life
but then
someone came along and gave me
this unexpected magical moment
that made me remember
who i really was
it was like a little treasure
okay so we need
to figure out who edna was
before she became a bureaucrat
and tap into that then
thats it
i dont understand why you dont
i dont think
want suavemente its a great song
no i love suavemente
it is great i agree
its a different beat
we just dont need it right now
look it look
hear me out its isabel
oh trust me i know it by heart
unicorn champagne
sex machine permission suits
and you know whats more important
than suavemente
we still dont have a grand finale
great well make one
the most important part
its a group number
of the whole show
and then everybody will dance out
into the crowd itll be amazing
oh thats so random
everybody dancing in the crowd
why is that random
weve done that already
its got to be something different
something personal
theyre all good and personal
and theyre there for a reason
i dont why are you
doing this right now
why are you making it like
we dont have a good show
i know you should be dancing in it
you have lost your mind
what are you talking about
im not dancing in the show
why are you saying no
to everything i say
have you noticed that
im not saying no ive said yes
on every single part of the show
we need something
climactic different
something personal
all right im
give me something
great
that i dont know about you
then do something personal
why is it about me
this is about women
youre a woman im not
im not gonna be dancing in the show
why dont you make it personal
well do whatever you want
do the thing that you and
antonio have been making
its great
thats personal aint it
hey its your show
give me something thats yours
open up
i did
when
the whole this whole time
and if you havent seen it i dont
know what to tell you about it
well i dont know
what to tell you about it
since i tried to kiss you
and you pulled away
you dont know how to open up
thats why you need the suavemente
oh still waiting for
passing trade you nosy fuck
your turn hes impossible
yes victor
i did not say anything
yeah yeah youre always
saying something in your head
just say it out loud man
you see the problem with max is
she tends to overcomplicate things
yeah
especially when she knows
exactly what she wants
and she knows exactly what she wants
when it comes to you
why do you work for her
you could easily work for roger
shes got bigger balls
listen motherfucker
i rest my case
yeah
you better make up your mind
oh just
because youre driving me crazy
yeah youre driving me crazy
what are you doing
just stop
okay just shut up
no you stop
you shut up
i just want a happy ending
spanish
youre an insane person
you know that right
spanish
spanish
spanish
given the debate and confusion
around the word love generally
what are we to make
of the word love
in the context of dancing
if you love dancing with someone
does that mean on some level
that you love them
what other feelings are
exchanged during a dance
can you dance
with someone you dont trust
should you trust someone
just because they can dance
max and mike werent
thinking about this
but they should have been
stop the music
stop the music stop the music
edna
edna
i am so sorry ms mendoza
im so deeply sorry to each and
every one of you beautiful creatures
sorry for what
height restrictions for stage risers
apparently your new stage is
three quarters of an inch too high
your exemption has been denied
youre to shut down immediately
but you had already approved it
i got a call
from an mps office its law
theres nothing i can do
keep working
ill take care of this
ill be right back
okay
how fucking dare you
youre not shutting me down again
not this time
max i sincerely want
to rebuild our trust
in the meantime im just trying
to look out for you
how is shutting down my show
looking out for me
im not talking about the show
then what are you talking about
im talking about your judgment
im talking
what i witnessed in the kitchen
in front of our daughter
roger i wouldnt get into a dispute
about judgment with me right now
you handed my familys theater
over to a fucking stripper
you dont know anything about mike
i know when youre being used
dont you see that
no
darling i know were all getting old
but i didnt know
you were so desperate
fuck you we care for each other
max have you even read
our settlement agreement
the language about denigrating
or harming the family brand
the moment that show goes up
mothers barristers will be clawing
back every last shilling in court
and i wont be able to stop her
but if youre still too deluded
to help yourself
please be mindful of zadie
she shouldnt have to pay
the price for your fantasies
would you please stop it
what
i know what youre thinking
youre thinking
what was she thinking
you werent thinking were you
you were falling in love
oh shut the fuck up
you think i dont know that
and dont you dare judge me
you were not there
that one fucking dance
changed everything in me
it feels like it made me
the best version of myself
but everybodys laughing at me
im a joke an embarrassment
not to him though
he believes in me
and i have to go tell him
that our show about
empowering women is dead
because im so fucking powerless
the most frightening part is that
im about to find out
if that dance meant
as much to him as it did to me
or if im just
another goddamn tuesday
no youre more like
a thursday madame
have i always been this adolescent
no
only when its raining
one two three four
five six seven eight
one
mike

the first act huh holy shit

your wise british butler voice

downton abbey on her ass
and if that bloke doesnt
pull his head from his own ass
youll be parented
from behind a closed door
for months years even
but you didnt tell her
you slipped mike the keys
please
if the lawyers found out
her careless manservant
failed to lock the rattigan doors
shell need plausible deniability
if theres anything ive learned
its that you cant tell
people anything
they have to have an experience
message from mike
end is not ending
sunday at seven we roll
the grand finale
let me see that
crikey its a haiku
seventeen syllables

victor
the rumors about the show were
a form of entertainment for some
but for the two people who created it
the terror of the opening night
could only be managed
by remembering
there would be no record of it
only the people who were there
would ever experience
the story of max and mike
as told through dance
theres small ships
theres tall ships
therere ships that sail the sea
theres no ships like friendships
so heres to you and me
one two three
lets go
we are strippers
all right man
lets go
yes
break a leg everyone

what your definition of okay is but
first things first

all i really want right now is
to tell these boring bags of dicks
to leave me alone
thats right lady isabel
see im here to tell you that
you can have anything you want
all you have to do is ask
what
okay really
really
okay
well i am a modest lady so
what if all i wanted was just a guy
in a tank top and some jeans
okay well
if i can have that then
what about a bad boy
hold up hold up
who always responds to my texts
all right
and now
if i can have that then
a sexy ceo who pays his women
more than his men
ooh meow
what about a guy with a puppy
okay let me just swallow my saliva
thats literally dripping out
of my mouth right now
if i could have all of that
why stop there
wait a minute
i cant be the only person
in this room
to feel what im feeling
right now am i
no
i didnt think so
i can tell by the looks
on your faces
now i want every single one
of you to know

a little bit of noise on this stage
doesnt go amiss sweethearts

and return at the end of pony
oh yes yes so you go
and no peeking
hell be watching you
now folks this next dance
is one that im wellacquainted with
things are about to get intimate
now a real man isnt afraid
to act on his desire
but the sexiest act of submission
is asking for permission
break a leg gov
aw bless ya
i know i know
we all want
a little bit of everything
all of the time dont we
but
sometimes
you just want to be
everything to someone right
sometimes
the greatest fantasy of them all
is knowing that youre the only one
you said to go hard
and so i did what you said
i mean you know
oh god
we showed up
thats pony
mike said after pony
no he just said pony
he definitely said after pony

im s im sorry
im so sorry
its okay i dont care
no im im just
im sorry im sorry
i hate you
come on lets go
no one can claim to fully understand
what exactly dance is
but what is abundantly clear
is that dance seeks
no meaning for its desires
it does not value age
or status logic or reason
it is a compass orientated
