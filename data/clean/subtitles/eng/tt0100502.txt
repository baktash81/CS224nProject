man ocp defines you as a machine
that utilises some living tissue
you understand that
yes
and so do you consider yourself human
i require an answer
stop tape
do you have any idea what
youre doing to that poor woman
take a look at her file go on
lawyer officer mrs murphy
is bringing suit against ocp
my name is tom delaney
im representing her
up to a few months ago
she wouldnt leave her bedroom
then there were the therapists
and the hypnotists
and then you pull this shit
drivin past her house day after day
spyinon her tryin to make her
think her husband is still alive
shes barely started to accept the loss
youre ripping her to pieces
and for what
do you think you could
ever be a husband to her
i mean what can you offer her
companionship
love
a mans love
no
roll tape
are you alex murphy
no
are you human
no
you are simply a machine
i am a machine
nothing more
nothing more
thatll do it stop tape
you stay there all right go get her
lets be decent about this
give them some privacy
i dont have a problem with that
alex
dont you know me
dont you remember me
alex it doesnt matter
what theyve done to you
touch me
its cold
they made this to honour him
no
your husband is dead
i dont know you
why is this happening
i thought all communication
systems were the same
i tried to save the company a few bucks
it took two days to download
specs from cleveland
i lost the account
it hardly befits the dignity of my office
to have to come to you
my apologies for
the slight inconvenience
20 minutes in rushhour traffic isnt slight
not when youre the mayor of a city
when are you gonna start paying
the cops so theyll go back to work
were not a charity the city
owes us over 37 million dollars
youll have to cut us some slack
a deadlines a deadline
how are we supposed to
raise that kind of money
you arent
what the hell is he talkin about
we dont expect you to pay
let me refer you to our contract
in the event of default ocp shall have
the right of foreclosure on all city assets
you signed this
so youre saying you can foreclose
we can and we will
were taking detroit private
so you deliberately
undermined our credit
that was the easy part
and you engineered the police strike
you want detroit to tear itself apart
so you can raid it like you would
any other corporation
do you know how many people
are dying out there youre murderers
id advise you to say nothing further
it might be actionable
its bullshit bullshit
you senile old bastard
its bullshit
we better get outta here
im ok
calm down i think wed better leave
calm down easy easy
im ok
right good
im in control everything is fine its ok
im fine

ive been very patient johnson
five months
whos that
dr juliette faxx just been moved up
to head the attitude adjustment team
five months 19 million dollars
i want to see some results
yes sir ill show you what we have
ocp pioneered cyborg technology
and now we take a quantum leap forward
stateoftheart destructive capabilities
commanded by a combination
of software and organic systems
in every way an improvement
over the original
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you robocop 2
trumpets
you are under arrest

ocp is proud to present the future
of urban pacification robocop 2
trumpets
aaaagh
crash
19 million
they all go crazy
robots with emotional problems
no sir no sir not robots  cyborgs
cybernetic organisms
we use living human tissue
and thats our whole problem
the candidates were all respected police
officers i reviewed their files myself
sir police officers may not be
the best candidates for our purposes
theyre physical macho bodyproud
finding themselves stripped of all that
its no wonder they become suicidal
our one success was a cop
well yes mr johnson  alex murphy
top of his class devout irish catholic
family man everything in his profile
indicates a fierce sense of duty
thats probably what kept him alive
with all due respect
your area of expertise
is psychology not robotics
theres no harm in hearing
the young lady out is there johnson
no sir
thank you sir
i believe murphys case was unusual but
not unique we can find someone else
someone to whom the prospect
might even be desirable
ive never met anyone
who wanted to be a robot
it would require a screening process
one id be happy to supervise
the cost would be negligible and
itd be a shame to waste
all the work thats been done
it certainly would my dear
go to it report to me directly
yes sir
you could learn a thing or two
from that girl johnson
demonstrators chanting
hey
the unions got a list
we aint forgettin who you are
one at a time
one at a time
its the best we can do

i cant believe youre contemplating this
it hardly matters what you believe
but these are criminals maniacs
youre given to premature
value judgements
all right it may be true
the subjects are socially misaligned
socially misaligned
these are deathrow inmates
and of no use to society we need
a subject wholl welcome the power
the virtual immortality we offer
now i really think this is
a good place to start looking
youre out of your mind
is that your professional opinion
yes goddamnit it is yes
and you are not using my lab to put
that kind of a brain into my cyborg
wed dearly miss you here
youre the one thats
gonna be out of a job
im gonna take this directly to johnson
hes just been waiting for
an excuse to get you fired
good morning sir
im sorry to bother you this early
you seem agitated
well frankly im shocked
mr schenk just called dr faxx has begun
screening candidates for robocop 2
so i understand
its very exciting
shes screening psychotics murderers
well we arent planning
to build a toy johnson
faxx knows what shes doing
shes keeping robocop off line
its a public relations disaster
youve got to learn to look at
the larger picture the foreclosure
you must know how
important that is to us
with robocop out of commission
the chaos down there will increase
so will the odds that the city
will fall into our hands
yes but a competent executive
would find a way to deal with
the corporate image problem
couldnt agree with you more
fortunately i have found a way
yes miss faxx and i
have already discussed it
i know youll help to implement her ideas
of course sir whatever i can do
anything else
coffee
no thank you
dont forget your shoes on the way out
grunts

well let you know when we need you

youre exactly this far
from gettin fired babe
shyster
hes one of mine
i want him back on his feet
well maybe he will be or maybe
well just sell the parts for scrap
thats up to us you see
robocops off warranty
robocops command programme
his set of directives
it determines his behaviour
its time to update the programme and
well i would like to hear
from each one of you
whispers its about time they asked us
well were getting a lot of heat
from the parents groups
personally i dont blame them
im a parent myself
all that destructive behaviour  hes
become a role model for our children
now what are we teaching them
you have a point
if hed just talk things out with people
instead of firing that big gun of his
couldnt he take time
to address environmental issues
excuse me what was that
he could speak out on the environment
dont see any reason why not
for all the shooting he does
ive never once seen him
take the time to do anything nice
like visit an orphanage
johnson youre absolutely right
or help a cat out of a tree
or go collecting for the red cross
or maybe even roasting some
marshmallows with some cub scouts
why mr johnson that is wonderful

cant be done not with this equipment

i cant believe that
well sure there are ways
you can pull his cranial circuits
which would shut down
his lifesupport system

if you want an honest government
a government that works for you
im asking you to dig deep
into your pockets
im asking you to give
whatever you can spare
where does that put us gilly
phone rings
hi yes maam
hello this is mayor kuzak
could you turn down your set please
your honour
i have some very good news for you
i think the city is saved
now
you listen very carefully
oh its no bluff someones
shown up to bail the city out
a rival corporation
the mayor isnt saying
and whoever it is is taking great pains
to keep their identity a secret
theyre paying in cash and theyre not
moving the money through the banks
thank you councilman
that will be all
you know once you guys take over
your services to ocp will be rewarded
if the city can pay well be humiliated
i think its worse than that sir
we shifted 80 percent of our liquid
resources to the urban pacification plan
if we cant foreclose public confidence in
ocp will plummet and so will our stock
sir if i may theres another option
we certainly have the surveillance
capabilities to follow the mayor
it all depends on
how far were willing to go
if anything went wrong
as i said sir it all depends
how far were willing to go
we have no legal recourse
there must be no witnesses
youve gone too far
think of your blood pressure
you can get me fired you are not
bringing illegal drugs into my lab
i would do worse than get you fired
now leave me alone
such terrible pain
you dont remember me
but you do remember this dont you
and we have it
all the nuke youll ever need
ah ah ah ah
not so fast i need you
to do something for me first
then the pain stops
good boy
i dont like this i think wed better
get outta here while we can
i know what im doing
if you have any cash
put it in your shorts
thats just plain rude
i wonder if any of you could help me
im looking for a mr hob
so how much you need
money i mean
well our current debt to ocp is
bob
guess youre in some pretty deep shit
we need all the help
we can get young man
tell you what put me down
for 50 just to make sure
50 cents 50 dollars thats cute
dont be a queer 50 million
this is bullshit lets get outta here
good god
gentlemen well will 50 do it
oh yes yes thatll do it
dont you guys think thatll do it
yeah
50 mill that will do it
for gods sake
these people are criminals
why do you have to label people
i hate labels
you shut up
but we cannot capitulate
in the war on crime
id be voted outta office
and i dont think anyone wants that
war on crimes fine with us
its business were talkin about here
do you have any idea
how many people we employ
you know i i never thought
about it like that sharp kid
so your war on crime
you wanna win it or what
were the only chance you have
listen to him hes got it all worked out
why do people do crimes
why drugs people do drugs
because they want drugs
the kind that cost too much
nuke gives high quality at a cheap price
if you get off our backs itll be cheaper
and safer
we dont go shovin our shit
down anybodys throat
and we dont advertise it like
they do with cigarettes or booze
so leave us alone and
anybody who wants it gets it
so no more crimes you get to be
the mayor who cleaned up detroit
hes got a point
dont you think hes got a point
yeah hes got a point
what the hell is that
get out
marv
shh
agh
cain
oh wow
growls
you look great
angie oh
oooh
itll take some getting used to but
itll be great cain
growls
agh
police siren
hob groans
lie still
im cold
you are going into shock
i will call for a medical emergency unit
wait no
dont leave me
i wont leave you
who did this
it was big
bigger than you
it was cain
im gonna die
you know what thats like dont you
it really sucks
whispers yes
tvpresenter 13 dead in what appears
to be a nukemoney massacre
among the victims two city councilmen
was the city trying to
strike a deal with the drug lords
no comment i said i have no comment
now no comments on these allegations
these were men who served
this city tirelessly
however i make a promise
to the people of detroit city
that no effort will be spared
to investigate this thoroughly
but mr mayor
im sorry no more questions
tv presenter our own mayor kuzak
now lets go live to jess
jess and here it is the civic centrum
ocps 100storey gift to the motor city
while debate continues
over ocps hostile takeover
theres no denying
the mood here is festive
citizens interviewed on the scene
expressed excitement and hope
that ocp will make good on
its promise of a better life in detroit
press
sorry folks media only
tv and press only
youll have to step back
woman there he is
can ocp bring industry back to detroit
can a corporation own the government
are you gonna hold elections
why arent you going to city hall
just a minute ill answer that young lady
city hall is the decaying symbol
of mismanagement and corruption
you get that
this magnificent structure will be
the seat of leadership for the new detroit
and what better place
for a clean fresh start
and so people of the press
city officials
in a few minutes omni consumer
products and the troubled city of detroit
will join in a bold new venture
now id like to explain
just what this will mean
sometimes we just have to start over
from scratch to make things right
and thats exactly what were going to do
were going to build a brand new city
where detroit now stands
an example to the world
trumpets
applause
my friends welcome to
our city as it should be
and as it will be in the hands
of responsible private enterprise
and a special welcome to mayor kuzak
and the outgoing administration
oh were not goin anywhere
your honour
youll have to tear down a lot
of peoples houses to make that
youre gonna take away their homes
were going to raise towers
of glass and steel
every citizen will have
a living unit safe secure and clean
now please take your seat
wont be room for neighbourhoods
not like the kind that we all grew up in
these days neighbourhoods
are places where bad things happen
dont be nostalgic
and democracy nobody elected you
anyone can buy ocp stock
and own a piece of our city
what could be more
democratic than that
well there are a lot of people in this town
that cant afford to buy your stock
and theyre not gonna
let you get away with this
you havent been following the polls
sit down
about a year ago
we gave this city robocop
i think hes worked out pretty well
but things have become
a little rougher out there
now we need a law enforcement unit
capable of meeting the enemy
on his own ground
and carrying enough fire power
to get the job done
