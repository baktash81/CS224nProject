  hi  mom 
  hi 
don t do    no  stop  stop it 
 man  ocp defines you as a machine   
   that utilises some living tissue 
you understand that 
yes 
and so  do you consider yourself human 
i require an answer 
stop tape 
do you have any idea what
you re doing to that poor woman 
take a look at her file  go on 
 lawyer  officer  mrs murphy
is bringing suit against ocp 
my name is tom delaney 
i m representing her 
up to a few months ago 
she wouldn t leave her bedroom 
then there were the therapists
and the hypnotists   
and then you pull this shit 
drivin  past her house  day after day 
spyin on her  tryin  to make her
think her husband is still alive 
she s barely started to accept the loss 
you re ripping her to pieces 
and for what 
do you think you could
ever be a husband to her 
i mean  what can you offer her 
companionship 
love 
a man s love 
no 
roll tape 
are you alex murphy 
no 
are you human 
no 
you are simply a machine 
i am    a machine 
nothing more 
nothing more 
that ll do it  stop tape 
you stay there  all right  go get her 
let s be decent about this 
give them some privacy 
i don t have a problem with that 
alex 
don t you know me 
don t you remember me 
alex  it doesn t matter
what they ve done to you 
touch me 
  it s cold 
  they made this to honour him 
  no   
  your husband is dead 
i don t know you 
why is this happening 
i thought all communication
systems were the same 
i tried to save the company a few bucks 
it took two days to download
specs from cleveland 
i lost the account 
it hardly befits the dignity of my office
to have to come to you 
my apologies for
the slight inconvenience 
20 minutes in rush hour traffic isn t slight 
not when you re the mayor of a city 
when are you gonna start paying
the cops so they ll go back to work 
we re not a charity  the city
owes us over 37 million dollars 
  you ll have to cut us some slack 
  a deadline s a deadline 
how are we supposed to
raise that kind of money 
you aren t 
  what the hell is he talkin  about 
  we don t expect you to pay 
let me refer you to our contract 
 in the event of default  ocp shall have
the right of foreclosure on all city assets  
  you signed this 
  so you re saying you can foreclose 
we can and we will 
we re taking detroit private 
so you deliberately
undermined our credit 
that was the easy part 
and you engineered the police strike 
you want detroit to tear itself apart   
   so you can raid it like you would
any other corporation 
do you know how many people
are dying out there  you re murderers 
i d advise you to say nothing further 
it might be    actionable 
it s bullshit  bullshit 
you senile old bastard 
  it s bullshit 
  we better get outta here 
  i m ok 
  calm down  i think we d better leave 
  calm down  easy  easy 
  i m ok 
  right  good 
  i m in control  everything is fine  it s ok 
i m fine 
one last thing  gentlemen 
  we will sue your asses 
  give it your best shot 
fuck you  you old senile bastard 
this is bullshit  fuck you 
it s bullshit  damn bullshit 
i ve been very patient  johnson 
five months 
  who s that 
  dr juliette faxx  just been moved up   
   to head the attitude adjustment team 
  five months  19 million dollars 
  i want to see some results 
  yes  sir  i ll show you what we have 
ocp pioneered cyborg technology 
and now we take a quantum leap forward 
state of the art destructive capabilities
commanded by a combination   
   of software and organic systems 
in every way  an improvement
over the original 
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you robocop 2 
 trumpets 
you are under arrest 
stop or i ll shoot 
stop or   
ocp is proud to present the future
of urban pacification  robocop 2 
 trumpets 
aaaagh 
 crash 
19 million 
  they all go crazy 
  robots with emotional problems 
no  sir  no  sir  not robots   cyborgs 
cybernetic organisms 
we use living  human tissue
and that s our whole problem 
the candidates were all respected police
officers  i reviewed their files myself 
sir  police officers may not be
the best candidates for our purposes 
they re physical  macho  body proud 
finding themselves stripped of all that 
it s no wonder they become suicidal 
our one success was a cop 
well  yes  mr johnson   alex murphy 
top of his class  devout irish catholic   
   family man  everything in his profile
indicates a fierce sense of duty 
  that s probably what kept him alive 
  with all due respect   
   your area of expertise
is psychology  not robotics 
there s no harm in hearing
the young lady out  is there  johnson 
  no  sir 
  thank you  sir 
i believe murphy s case was unusual  but
not unique  we can find someone else 
someone to whom the prospect
might even be    desirable 
i ve never met anyone
who wanted to be a robot 
it would require a screening process 
one i d be happy to supervise 
the cost would be negligible and   
   it d be a shame to waste
all the work that s been done 
it certainly would  my dear 
go to it  report to me directly 
yes  sir 
you could learn a thing or two
from that girl  johnson 
 demonstrators chanting 
hey 
the union s got a list 
we ain t forgettin  who you are 
one at a time 
one at a time 
  it s the best we can do

agh 
 screaming 
you said you were just gonna scare him 
doesn t he look scared 
 screaming 
  i can t believe you re contemplating this 
  it hardly matters what you believe 
but these are criminals  maniacs 
you re given to premature
value judgements 
all right  it may be true 
the subjects are socially misaligned 
socially misaligned 
these are death row inmates 
and of no use to society  we need
a subject who ll welcome the power   
   the virtual immortality we offer 
now  i really think this is
a good place to start looking 
you re out of your mind 
is that your professional opinion 
yes  goddamnit  it is  yes 
and you are not using my lab to put
that kind of a brain into my cyborg 
we d dearly miss you here 
you re the one that s
gonna be out of a job 
i m gonna take this directly to johnson 
he s just been waiting for
an excuse to get you fired 
good morning  sir 
i m sorry to bother you this early 
  you seem agitated 
  well  frankly  i m shocked 
mr schenk just called  dr faxx has begun
screening candidates for robocop 2 
so i understand 
  it s very exciting 
  she s screening psychotics  murderers 
well  we aren t planning
to build a toy  johnson 
  faxx knows what she s doing 
  she s keeping robocop off line 
it s a public relations disaster 
you ve got to learn to look at
the larger picture  the foreclosure 
you must know how
important that is to us 
with robocop out of commission 
the chaos down there will increase 
so will the odds that the city
will fall into our hands 
yes  but a competent executive
would find a way to deal with   
   the corporate image problem 
  couldn t agree with you more 
fortunately  i have found a way 
yes  miss faxx and i
have already discussed it 
i know you ll help to implement her ideas 
  of course  sir  whatever i can do 
  anything else 
  coffee 
  no  thank you 
don t forget your shoes on the way out 
 grunts 
  he s my patient  i have to stay with him 
  we ll let you know when we need you 
nobody on your staff has
my experience with him  you need me 
  we don t need anybody 
   we   who the hell are  we  
you re a lawyer 
you know nothing about him 
you re exactly this far
from gettin  fired  babe 
shyster 
he s one of mine 
i want him back on his feet 
well  maybe he will be  or maybe
we ll just sell the parts for scrap 
that s up to us  you see 
robocop s off warranty 
robocop s command programme 
his set of directives   
   it determines his behaviour 
it s time to update the programme and   
   well  i would like to hear
from each one of you 
 whispers  it s about time they asked us 
well  we re getting a lot of heat
from the parents  groups 
personally  i don t blame them  
i m a parent myself 
all that destructive behaviour   he s
become a role model for our children 
  now  what are we teaching them 
  you have a point 
if he d just talk things out with people 
instead of firing that big gun of his 
couldn t he take time
to address environmental issues 
  excuse me  what was that 
  he could speak out on the environment 
  don t see any reason why not 
  for all the shooting he does   
   i ve never once seen him
take the time to do anything nice   
   like visit an orphanage 
 johnson  you re absolutely right 
or help a cat out of a tree   
   or go collecting for the red cross   
   or maybe even roasting some
marshmallows with some cub scouts   
why  mr johnson  that is wonderful 
thank you so much   
  the programme isn t uploading 
  he s resisting 
  there s too much data 
  no  it s him  leave him to me 
it s not going to work 
you re wasting valuable time 
don t resist us 
let me up  i must go 
go where  hm

thank you for not smoking 
well  there it is  it s ocp 
  they screwed him up 
  he must be goin  out of his mind 
it s not as if he can just say no 
they ve put all this
nonsense into his brain 
  he has to obey 
  take them out  all of them 
can t be done  not with this equipment 
are you saying there s no way 
i can t believe that 
well  sure  there are ways 
you can pull his cranial circuits 
which would shut down
his life support system 
could run a few thousand volts
through him  pray his insulation holds 
probably kill him 
  let go 
  i ll get some help 
  get him inside 
  come on  move it 
don t touch him  he s hot 
use your jackets 
  why did he do that 
  ocp gave him crazy commands 
fried himself to get rid of them 
he weighs a ton

spider baby stalirski  he s come out
for detroit and now you come out for him 
the lines are open 
waiting for your pledge 
if you want an honest government 
a government that works for you   
   i m asking you to dig deep
into your pockets 
i m asking you to give   
   whatever you can spare 
where does that put us  gilly 
 phone rings 
hi  yes  ma am 
hello  this is mayor kuzak 
could you turn down your set  please 
your honour   
   i have some very good news for you 
i think the city is saved 
now   
   you listen very carefully 
oh  it s no bluff  someone s
shown up to bail the city out 
  a rival corporation 
  the mayor isn t saying   
   and whoever it is is taking great pains
to keep their identity a secret 
they re paying in cash and they re not
moving the money through the banks 
thank you  councilman 
that will be all 
you know  once you guys take over   
your services to ocp will be rewarded 
  if the city can pay  we ll be humiliated 
  i think it s worse than that  sir 
we shifted 80 percent of our liquid
resources to the urban pacification plan 
if we can t foreclose  public confidence in
ocp will plummet and so will our stock 
sir  if i may  there s another option 
we certainly have the surveillance
capabilities to follow the mayor 
it all depends on
how far we re willing to go 
if anything went wrong   
as i said  sir  it all depends
how far we re willing to go 
we have no legal recourse 
there must be no witnesses 
  you ve gone too far 
  think of your blood pressure 
you can get me fired  you are not
bringing illegal drugs into my lab 
i would do worse than get you fired 
now  leave me alone 
such terrible pain 
you don t remember me 
but you do remember this  don t you 
and we have it 
all the nuke you ll ever need 
ah  ah  ah  ah 
not so fast  i need you
to do something for me first 
then the pain stops 
good boy 
i don t like this  i think we d better
get outta here while we can 
i know what i m doing 
if you have any cash 
put it in your shorts 
that s just plain rude 
i wonder if any of you could help me 
i m looking for a mr hob 
so  how much you need 
  money  i mean 
  well  our current debt to ocp is   
bob 
 37 480 911 
guess you re in some pretty deep shit 
we need all the help
we can get  young man 
tell you what  put me down
for 50 just to make sure 
50 cents  50 dollars  that s cute 
don t be a queer  50 million 
this is bullshit  let s get outta here 
good god 
gentlemen  well  will 50 do it 
oh  yes  yes  that ll do it 
  don t you guys think that ll do it 
  yeah 
50 mill  that will do it 
for god s sake 
these people are criminals 
why do you have to label people 
i hate labels 
you shut up 
but we cannot capitulate
in the war on crime 
i d be voted outta office 
and i don t think anyone wants that 
war on crime s fine with us 
it s business we re talkin  about here 
do you have any idea
how many people we employ 
you know  i    i never thought
about it like that  sharp kid 
so  your war on crime 
you wanna win it or what 
we re the only chance you have 
listen to him  he s got it all worked out 
why do people do crimes 
why drugs  people do drugs 
because they want drugs 
the kind that cost too much 
nuke gives high quality at a cheap price 
  if you get off our backs  it ll be cheaper 
  and safer 
we don t go shovin  our shit
down anybody s throat 
and we don t advertise it like
they do with cigarettes or booze 
so leave us alone and
anybody who wants it  gets it 
so no more crimes  you get to be
the mayor who cleaned up detroit 
he s got a point 
  don t you think he s got a point 
  yeah  he s got a point 
what the hell is that

 tvpresenter  13 dead in what appears
to be a nuke money massacre 
among the victims  two city councilmen 
was the city trying to
strike a deal with the drug lords 
no comment  i said i have no comment 
now  no comments on these allegations 
these were men who served
this city tirelessly 
however  i make a promise
to the people of detroit city   
   that no effort will be spared
to investigate this thoroughly 
  but mr mayor   
  i m sorry  no more questions 
 tv presenter  our own mayor kuzak 
now let s go live to jess 
 jess  and here it is  the civic centrum 
ocp s 100 storey gift to the motor city 
while debate continues
over ocp s hostile takeover   
   there s no denying
the mood here is festive 
citizens interviewed on the scene
expressed excitement and hope   
   that ocp will make good on
its promise of a better life in detroit 
  press 
  sorry  folks  media only 
tv and press only 
you ll have to step back 
 woman  there he is 
  can ocp bring industry back to detroit 
  can a corporation own the government 
  are you gonna hold elections 
  why aren t you going to city hall 
just a minute  i ll answer that  young lady 
city hall is the decaying symbol
of mismanagement and corruption 
you get that 
this magnificent structure will be
the seat of leadership for the new detroit 
and what better place
for a clean  fresh start 
and so  people of the press 
city officials   
   in a few minutes  omni consumer
products and the troubled city of detroit   
   will join in a bold new venture 
now  i d like to explain
just what this will mean 
sometimes we just have to start over   
   from scratch  to make things right 
and that s exactly what we re going to do 
we re going to build a brand new city 
where detroit now stands   
   an example to the world 
 trumpets 
 applause 
my friends  welcome to
our city as it should be   
   and as it will be  in the hands
of responsible private enterprise 
and a special welcome to mayor kuzak
and the outgoing administration 
oh  we re not goin  anywhere 
your honour 
you ll have to tear down a lot
of people s houses to make that 
you re gonna take away their homes 
we re going to raise towers
of glass and steel 
every citizen will have
a living unit  safe  secure and clean 
  now  please  take your seat 
  won t be room for neighbourhoods 
not like the kind that we all grew up in 
these days neighbourhoods
are places where bad things happen 
  don t be nostalgic 
  and democracy  nobody elected you 
anyone can buy ocp stock
and own a piece of our city 
what could be more
democratic than that 
well  there are a lot of people in this town
that can t afford to buy your stock 
and they re not gonna
let you get away with this 
you haven t been following the polls 
sit down 
about a year ago
we gave this city robocop 
i think he s worked out pretty well   
   but things have become
a little rougher out there 
now we need a law enforcement unit   
   capable of meeting the enemy
on his own ground   
   and carrying enough fire power
to get the job done 
 trumpets 
ladies and gentlemen   
   with great pleasure   
   i give you robocop 2 
  bastards  maniacs 
  what s the matter 
i can t believe it  it was them  they sent it 
  sent what 
  nothin  
there s going to be a big call for this unit
and we ll make him right here in detroit 
that means jobs we can all be proud of   
   and make  made in america 
mean something again 
 applause 
this single container holds
enough nuke to addict a city block 
a hundred of these
are produced every day   
   and sent to sweatshops where
urban slaves prepare this poison   
   for our friends 
our loved ones  our children 
now i say it s high time
we put an end to this plague 
robocop 2 will seek out every laboratory 
every dealer and rid our city of nuke 
ah  yes  things will be
a lot quieter with this boy around 
  what s wrong with him 
  it s nothing  it s nothing at all 
  turn him off 
  i can t 
 robocop  cain  let s step outside 
you  get outta here  you re obsolete 
that thing is a killer 
  it s not even armed  it s harmless 
  it s a killer and i saw it 
  get her out of here  now 
  let me go  no

goodbye 
it s serious trouble 
so many dead and wounded 
  there won t be trouble from the dead 
  they ll have relatives  they always do 
  it ll be a feeding frenzy 
  it s only money 
  what about criminal proceedings 
  well  we re looking at major indictments 
  prison terms 
  what about me 
  you know we ll do whatever we can 
  that s not good enough 
sir  what if this was
all the work of one individual 
a person with her own agenda that wasn t
in sync with the goals of our company 
well  that usually works 
a woman who was not a team player 
who violated our trust 
well  we d need
some evidence to support that 
sir  whether it exists or not 
i know i can find it 
she did choose the brain  sir 
  good thinking 
  sir 
thank god you re all right 
i was so worried 
  i thought it was going to hurt you 
  no  no  it s over  it s all over

  don t be hard on yourself 
everything is going to be all right 
johnson  that business we were
talking about   get right on it

ocp won t own this city for long 
i ll see to that 
i will take it to the streets  to the people
