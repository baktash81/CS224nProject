you had no idea how to fight that fight 
those combination codes  you didn t

you threw them in there cocky
and half assed 
  you never gave him a chance 
  he wasn t that good 
noisy boy was a great robot 
was  was a great robot
back in the league  back in the day 
but look around you  this place is
where once great robots go to die

shut up and get in the truck

robots are on the east side 
we got to be quick in here 
once we re through here 
there s no more searchlights  quick  go 
  here it is 
  what are we looking for 
anything i could use
to put a fighting bot together 
  hey  look 
  what 
it s so small 
yeah  that s before your time 
that s a generation one 
the very first fighting bot 
they wanted them to look like us 
the more human  the better 
crazy how quick everything changed 
put that in the cart 
  what changed 
  a good question  human boxing 
  it just faded 
  why 
because the money moved on 
people wanted more carnage  more show 
you had the whole brazilian underground 
the gracies  the machados 
jiu jitsu  muay thai 
and a thousand styles in between 
full on ground and pound 
  look at this 
  what s that 
i don t know 
not bad  good spot 
you still had human fighters 
human bodies 
so you couldn t give the people
what they really wanted 
true  no holds barred violence 
the next logical step 
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other 
do you miss it 
  boxing  do you miss it 
  careful 
what  i want to know 
careful  you re on a cliff 
that s a long way down 
if you fell  you d definitely   
charlie  help me

charlie  i think
there s a whole robot in there 
so what  let s go  come on 
i m taking him with me 
he saved my life 
he did not save your life 
i saved your life  let s go 
just bring the cart to the edge 
i ll use the winch to get him out 
you want that piece of junk  you get
the cart yourself  i m through here 
this is what s left of noisy boy 
that s it 
his head does make a nice addition
to the front of the crash palace 
  it s not funny 
  let s get a robot  you and me 
good idea  you re broke 
i m almost there myself 
  you destroyed the best shot you had 
  we ll put one together 
you re brilliant at this 
there s good stuff here 
  there s nothing here 
  there is  look 
all your junk is    it s junk 
you re not even in the game anymore 
  it s all garbage 
  i heard you  it s garbage 
don t get loud with me 
  you re your problem 
  what s that supposed to mean 
i have been here for you a long time 
in the ring  out of the ring  and the
whole ugly spiral down  and i m tired 
my father invested everything he had
in your fight career  we loved   
he loved you like family 
and this is his home 
i m just trying not to let it die 
that s my plan 
what s yours 
you re done  right 
you re finally done 
because i sure as hell am  charlie 
i got nothing left 
all right 
maybe there s something here 
this robot the kid brought in last
night  would you look at it for me 
please 
i ve never seen anything like it before 
he s generation two  but barely 
i found a power cell that fits him  and
i hooked him up to this old g 2 remote 
you can move him around  but he s crap 
maybe i can get a sparring gig for him 
make a few hundred bucks 
stop 
it s my robot 
it took me half the night
dragging him out of there  he s mine 
he s yours  yeah  but the parts
we re putting in him are mine 
you idiots should see if he powers up
before you fight over him 
what happened to you 
watch out  stay back 
looks like he s got a shadow function 
that s pretty rare 
he can mime your movements
and store them in memory 
  is there anything here we could use 
  not much 
there s a bucket   
there s a bucket
i use to wash the truck 
use it and clean him up 
he smells like crap 
wash yourself off  too 
while you re at it  you stink 
i switched him to remote 
it s pretty basic 
just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him 
  you play video games  right 
  of course 
same idea  only this one s
a thousand pound robot 
cool 
 atom  
his name is atom 
can we get him a fight 
i don t think he was
ever a boxing robot 
he s a g 2  built in early 2014 
he was a sparring bot 
they must have built robots
like this one
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot 
ok  so can we get him a fight 
are you not listening 
he s a sparring bot 
built to take a lot of hits  but never
dishing out any real punishment 
you could always sell him off for parts 
  can t you get him a fight 
   why can t you get him a fight  
god  you don t quit  do you 
you want me to put him in some
bottom rung scrap fest to the death 
i saw how scared you were
at crash palace 
the places that would let you fight this
robot would make you pee your pants 
excellent  get him a fight 
stubborn kid 
surprise  surprise 
let s take a walk 
can you understand me 
don t worry  your secret s safe with me 
you ve known charlie a long time 
too long 
we both kind of grew up in this gym 
my dad  he trained him 
that s them  that s charlie 
  what was he like 
  as a boxer 
  as anything 
  he was something 
he was lean  tough 
no quit  no fear 
come here  i want to show you something 
i have this newspaper article
from phoenix 2007
when charlie fought nico tandy 
the top contender 
you were at the nico tandy fight 
i was  charlie was supposed to be
a warm up fight  an easy win 
nico wasn t even supposed
to break a sweat  but   
   nobody told charlie that  so he
just kept coming and coming at him 
check this out 
that s charlie 
first  nico couldn t believe
the balls on this nobody 
but charlie kept coming 
and that s when nico looked scared 
  really 
  really 
he was toying with nico 
the top contender 
number two in the world 
and charlie was dancing with him 
charlie was floating
inches off the canvas that night 
he was like a ghost 
nico couldn t even see him 
i could 
he was beautiful

yeah 
zeus  no one has ever gone two rounds
with this monster  two rounds 
the champ puts his real steel world
championship belt on the line tonight 
he just may have a real fight
on his hands 
zeus  greatest robot boxer of all time 
ever  end of story  good night 
  so cool  it s so cool 
  what 
come on 
listen up  i got to go find finn 
i want you to stay in this area 
out of the way  champ coming through 
zeus coming through 
move  move  champ coming through 
farra lemkova  daughter behind
the father daughter zeus team 
they say your father s the money
and you are the mind behind zeus 
you re very kind 
but i assure you  the mind behind zeus
belongs to the great tak mashido 
what did it take to lure
the reclusive genius  former boy wonder
and arguably the most important
bot designer in the history of the sport
out of retirement 
why don t you ask him yourself 
is this tak mashido s greatest creation 
zeus is autonomous
and constantly evolving during a fight 
with his adaptive operating system 
he recognizes patterns and rewrites
his fight code instantaneously 
for myself and joe sixpack out there 
are you saying that zeus 
i m saying that no matter
what happens in that ring   
   the result of any fight is inevitable 
what zeus sees   
   he kills 
sweet 
i m never going into business with you 
i just need a break here 
you got that old bot truck out there 
you always got something in there 
i got an old sparring bot 
ain t worth the paint left on it 
what am i supposed to do with that 
the zoo  take him to the zoo 
they fight there tomorrow 
even i wouldn t be caught dead
at the zoo 
i just need a little loan 
what 
  you re serious  charlie 
  a loan 
couple hundred  few hundred 
whatever you got 
you know i m good for it 
i know you  and as much
as i like you  dude   
   you re a bad bet  brother 
right  yeah 
did you see that 
that s what s left of axelrod 
where you been  i told you to stay put 
you should have seen him 
zeus was  like  amazing 
  amazing  huh 
  unbelievable  yeah 
he was just peppering axelrod with
punches  but so fast  it was incredible 
axelrod didn t even land a punch 
he didn t even survive the first round 
is that what you think boxing is 
zeus beating up some piece of steel
that they feed him 
axelrod s not just some piece of steel 
and that is what boxing is now 
deal with it 
and i love it  and i m in it now

  yeah 
i killed it  got rid of it 
we don t need it anymore 
how did you

out of noisy boy

it really  really works 
what works 
i got to turn it on 
left jab  right uppercut

easy there  chief 
did you drink all these sodas 
i might have had a few 
i need you to teach him to box 
are you kidding me  he s not advanced
enough to handle noisy s voice command 
so he needs your moves  your commands 
  start over from the ground up

yeah  what do you say 
welcome to new york s bing arena
and the real steel championship bout 
tim  it s the fight
we never thought we d see 
zeus  the undefeated wrb champion 
against the underdog  rising star atom 
the champ s handlers
have agreed to fight
outside the circle
of well known league bots 
and have decided to give the people
a true david versus goliath spectacle 
now  tim  help me out on this 
has the zeus camp lost their mind 
the greatest robot boxer of all time
gives a shot at the belt
to a g 2 named atom 
well  herb  if you ask tak mashido 
team zeus has lost their minds 
now  he may look cool
as he enters the arena 
but he has made no bones
about his disdain for this matchup 
our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week 
look at this clip  mashido wouldn t
even stop to talk to the press 
referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation 
now  max kenton  atom s trainer 
did more than just challenge zeus 
he did so publicly 
the challenge went viral and created
a pr nightmare for the champ 
no argument there  and i think the zeus
camp knows exactly what they re doing 
that they do  come on 
giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere 
this  junkyard dog   if you will 
that s a marketing stunt 
and judging from this crowd 
that stunt is working 
we can t win  can we 
we ll see 
as the challenger
makes his way into the arena 
you can hear the surge of excitement

onto the wrb scene with a vengeance

who simply won t back down 
the crowd is going nuts 
zeus gives it everything he s got
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one 
zeus corners atom 
going double duty with both fists 
downtown  uptown 
as the clock winds down 
  hands up  chin down 
  stay low  stay low 
only five seconds left  as here comes
that piston packed right of the champ 
there s the bell  i don t believe it 
somehow atom has survived 
we will have a second round 
and the crowd here is thrilled 
he made it  yeah  corner 
we got to get out of here

ok  you sit down 
  let s go  homey

both corners furiously working
on their bots 
this crowd came here tonight
expecting a massacre 
but instead they re getting a war 
  you got it 
  yeah 
all right  here we go 
what is happening 
he is fully prepared for all possible
contingencies  he will be fine 
what next 
round two 
round two kicks off 
and incredibly the challenger  atom 
is giving the champ a run for his money 
zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can 
kenton working his bot with a trifecta
of straight rights to the champ s dome 
toe to toe they stand 
trading deafening blows 
whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed 
metal bashing metal 
steel smashing steel 
this is a brawl 
the crowd is on their feet  watching two
machines driven to kill each other 
something has to give  and it does 
atom goes down again 
lights out for the junkyard dog who put
on a heck of a show here tonight 
and yet again  atom rises up 
kenton must have hardwired
this bot with the will to go on 
midway through round four  and zeus
is looking to end this thing right now 
the champ is holding nothing back
as he cracks open the hurt locker 
atom is stumbling around the ring 
apparently disoriented and dazed 
  hands up 
  what s going on 
i think the voice recog is shot 
he s not responding 
zeus has found yet another gear of
violence  drilling atom s midsection 
no  stop  do something 
he can t hear me 
but the bell sounds  and once again
this little robot has stunned the world 
we re done  max  he can t hear me 
this is murder  we ve had enough 
  i m disabling the voice recognition 
  he can t hear me 
  yes  but he can see you 
  what 
i m putting him in shadow mode 
show him what to do 
without the voice recognition 
he ll move even faster 
no way  no way 
look at them  they are freaking out 
rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there 
do you know why 
because they re scared 
because atom can do things
no other bot has ever done 
  but i can t do it 
  yes  you can 
  i can t 
  yes  you can 
show him what to do 
you have to fight the last round

an epic battle being waged here tonight 
as the fifth and final round
gets underway 
come on  atom 
wait a second  are you seeing this 
charlie kenton is shadowboxing
just outside the ring 
it looks like atom
has a shadow function 
so  basically 
that means charlie kenton
is fighting the last round
of this fight against zeus 
it doesn t seem to help  because atom
is backed up against the ropes again 
help him  fight back 
not yet 
tak mashido supervising personally
as zeus hammers down 
furiously trying to end this thing
once and for all 
i got to tell you  folks

this robot seems to be running on empty 
i don t believe it 
atom is taunting zeus 
  switch to turbo

  that s right  charlie  not yet 
nitrous pistons  now

atom is riddled with the nitrous fueled
gatling guns of zeus s blows 
atom  atom  atom  atom 
wait him out  wait him out  not yet 
zeus is slowing down 
the champ s power core
is clearly depleted 
charlie  please

manually operating his robot personally

desperately to stay on his feet 
but kenton is relentless  landing
blow after blow after blow to the body 
left  right  left  right

this little bot has
dug deep here tonight
and shown something damn near heart 
one  two  three

zeus gets to his feet 
but kenton has atom on him again 
landing punch after punch 
tak mashido and his super bot

humiliating near loss
