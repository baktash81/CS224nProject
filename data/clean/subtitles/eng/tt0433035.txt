he wasnt that good

come on
easy easy easy easy
quick quick down in here go go go
robots are on the east side
we got to be quick in here
once were through here
theres no more searchlights quick go
here it is
what are we looking for
anything i could use
to put a fighting bot together
hey look
what
its so small
yeah thats before your time
thats a generation one
the very first fighting bot
they wanted them to look like us
the more human the better
crazy how quick everything changed
put that in the cart
what changed
a good question human boxing
it just faded
why
because the money moved on
people wanted more carnage more show
you had the whole brazilian underground
the gracies the machados
jiujitsu muay thai
and a thousand styles in between
fullon groundandpound
look at this
whats that
i dont know
not bad good spot
you still had human fighters
human bodies
so you couldnt give the people
what they really wanted
true noholdsbarred violence
the next logical step
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other
do you miss it
boxing do you miss it
careful
what i want to know
careful youre on a cliff
thats a long way down
if you fell youd definitely
charlie help me

just bring the cart to the edge
ill use the winch to get him out
you want that piece of junk you get
the cart yourself im through here
this is whats left of noisy boy

his head does make a nice addition
to the front of the crash palace
its not funny
lets get a robot you and me
good idea youre broke
im almost there myself
you destroyed the best shot you had
well put one together
youre brilliant at this
theres good stuff here
theres nothing here
there is look
all your junk is its junk
youre not even in the game anymore
its all garbage
i heard you its garbage
dont get loud with me
youre your problem
whats that supposed to mean
i have been here for you a long time
in the ring out of the ring and the
whole ugly spiral down and im tired
my father invested everything he had
in your fight career we loved
he loved you like family
and this is his home
im just trying not to let it die
thats my plan
whats yours
youre done right
youre finally done
because i sure as hell am charlie
i got nothing left
all right
maybe theres something here
this robot the kid brought in last
night would you look at it for me
please
ive never seen anything like it before
hes generation two but barely
i found a power cell that fits him and
i hooked him up to this old g2 remote
you can move him around but hes crap
maybe i can get a sparring gig for him
make a few hundred bucks
stop
its my robot
it took me half the night
dragging him out of there hes mine
hes yours yeah but the parts
were putting in him are mine
you idiots should see if he powers up
before you fight over him
what happened to you
watch out stay back
looks like hes got a shadow function
thats pretty rare
he can mime your movements
and store them in memory
is there anything here we could use
not much
theres a bucket
theres a bucket
i use to wash the truck
use it and clean him up
he smells like crap
wash yourself off too
while youre at it you stink
i switched him to remote
its pretty basic
just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him
you play video games right
of course
same idea only this ones
a thousandpound robot
cool
atom
his name is atom
can we get him a fight
i dont think he was
ever a boxing robot
hes a g2 built in early 2014
he was a sparring bot
they must have built robots
like this one
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot
ok so can we get him a fight
are you not listening
hes a sparring bot
built to take a lot of hits but never
dishing out any real punishment
you could always sell him off for parts
cant you get him a fight
why cant you get him a fight
god you dont quit do you
you want me to put him in some
bottomrung scrapfest to the death
i saw how scared you were
at crash palace
the places that would let you fight this
robot would make you pee your pants
excellent get him a fight
stubborn kid
surprise surprise
lets take a walk
can you understand me
dont worry your secrets safe with me
youve known charlie a long time
too long
we both kind of grew up in this gym
my dad he trained him
thats them thats charlie
what was he like
as a boxer
as anything
he was something
he was lean tough
no quit no fear
come here i want to show you something
i have this newspaper article
from phoenix 2007
when charlie fought nico tandy
the top contender
you were at the nico tandy fight
i was charlie was supposed to be
a warmup fight an easy win
nico wasnt even supposed
to break a sweat but
nobody told charlie that so he
just kept coming and coming at him
check this out
thats charlie
first nico couldnt believe
the balls on this nobody
but charlie kept coming
and thats when nico looked scared
really
really
he was toying with nico
the top contender
number two in the world
and charlie was dancing with him
charlie was floating
inches off the canvas that night
he was like a ghost
nico couldnt even see him
i could
he was beautiful
he was beautiful
so what happened
did charlie beat nico tandy
no nico tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round twice
second time for good lights out
you were ahead on the scorecards
going into the 12th round
nico tandy rung my bell
and went on to be the undefeated
world champ for the next three years
he knocked you out
yeah so did a lot of guys
you knocked a lot of guys out too
24 and 19 its not exactly a career
but every fight a knockout
yeah
win or lose fights not over
till someones on the mat
till someones on the mat
your old man taught me that
damn straight he taught you that
who else did you fight

listen up i got to go find finn
i want you to stay in this area
out of the way champ coming through
zeus coming through
move move champ coming through
farra lemkova daughter behind
the fatherdaughter zeus team
they say your fathers the money
and you are the mind behind zeus
youre very kind
but i assure you the mind behind zeus
belongs to the great tak mashido
what did it take to lure
the reclusive genius former boy wonder
and arguably the most important
bot designer in the history of the sport
out of retirement
why dont you ask him yourself
is this tak mashidos greatest creation
zeus is autonomous
and constantly evolving during a fight
with his adaptive operating system
he recognizes patterns and rewrites
his fight code instantaneously
for myself and joe sixpack out there
are you saying that zeus
im saying that no matter
what happens in that ring
the result of any fight is inevitable
what zeus sees
he kills
sweet
im never going into business with you
i just need a break here
you got that old bot truck out there
you always got something in there
i got an old sparring bot
aint worth the paint left on it
what am i supposed to do with that

you should have seen him
zeus was like amazing
amazing huh
unbelievable yeah
he was just peppering axelrod with
punches but so fast it was incredible
axelrod didnt even land a punch
he didnt even survive the first round
is that what you think boxing is
zeus beating up some piece of steel
that they feed him
axelrods not just some piece of steel
and that is what boxing is now
deal with it

welcome to new yorks bing arena
and the real steel championship bout
tim its the fight
we never thought wed see
zeus the undefeated wrb champion
against the underdog rising star atom
the champs handlers
have agreed to fight
outside the circle
of wellknown league bots
and have decided to give the people
a true david versus goliath spectacle
now tim help me out on this
has the zeus camp lost their mind
the greatest robot boxer of all time
gives a shot at the belt
to a g2 named atom
well herb if you ask tak mashido
team zeus has lost their minds
now he may look cool
as he enters the arena
but he has made no bones
about his disdain for this matchup
our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week
look at this clip mashido wouldnt
even stop to talk to the press
referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation
now max kenton atoms trainer
did more than just challenge zeus
he did so publicly
the challenge went viral and created
a pr nightmare for the champ
no argument there and i think the zeus
camp knows exactly what theyre doing
that they do come on
giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere
this junkyard dog if you will
thats a marketing stunt
and judging from this crowd
that stunt is working
we cant win can we
well see
as the challenger
makes his way into the arena
you can hear the surge of excitement
atom has arrived
onto the wrb scene with a vengeance
using a style
some would call it humanlike
that bot fighting has rarely seen
atom and his pintsize trainer
step into the ring
and the look on
farra lemkovas face says it all
welcome to the bigs junior
im giving onetofive odds that atom
dont make it out the first round
who wants some
ill take some of that action
hey there
ill take some of that action
hows it going partner
partner

hundred k says atom
doesnt see round two

that kind of scratch

for the world robot
boxing championship

of this universe
and any other universe known
or unknown
the mighty zeus
and now ladies and gentlemen
are you ready
for real steel
this is what its all about
theres the starting bell
and we are underway
the bots emerge from their corners
zeus decks atom and he is already down
on your feet
looks like we are in
for another zeus clinic
referee matt geiger
coming in the ring to start the count
get up
push up stand up
but look at this
the little bots back on his feet
to get a second blistering attack
from zeus

atoms getting pummeled into the corner

get out of the corner
kenton desperately trying to command
his robot out of that suicide corner

and possibly final time tonight

an uppercut that he never saw coming
advance
fade back counter right
fade back counter right
right cross right cross

lets go come on
take him down
for the first time in his dominant run
zeus has met a bot
who simply wont back down
the crowd is going nuts
zeus gives it everything hes got
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one
zeus corners atom
going double duty with both fists
downtown uptown
as the clock winds down
hands up chin down
stay low stay low
only five seconds left as here comes
that pistonpacked right of the champ
theres the bell i dont believe it
somehow atom has survived
we will have a second round
and the crowd here is thrilled

we got to go this way come on
ok you sit down
lets go homey

both corners furiously working
on their bots
this crowd came here tonight
expecting a massacre
but instead theyre getting a war
you got it
yeah
all right here we go
what is happening
he is fully prepared for all possible
contingencies he will be fine
what next
round two
round two kicks off
and incredibly the challenger atom
is giving the champ a run for his money
zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can
kenton working his bot with a trifecta
of straight rights to the champs dome
toetotoe they stand
trading deafening blows
whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed
metal bashing metal
steel smashing steel
this is a brawl
the crowd is on their feet watching two
machines driven to kill each other
something has to give and it does
atom goes down again
lights out for the junkyard dog who put
on a heck of a show here tonight
and yet again atom rises up
kenton must have hardwired
this bot with the will to go on
midway through round four and zeus
is looking to end this thing right now
the champ is holding nothing back
as he cracks open the hurt locker
atom is stumbling around the ring
apparently disoriented and dazed
hands up
whats going on
i think the voice recog is shot
hes not responding
zeus has found yet another gear of
violence drilling atoms midsection
no stop do something
he cant hear me
but the bell sounds and once again
this little robot has stunned the world
were done max he cant hear me
this is murder weve had enough
im disabling the voice recognition
he cant hear me
yes but he can see you
what
im putting him in shadow mode
show him what to do
without the voice recognition
hell move even faster
no way no way
look at them they are freaking out
rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there
do you know why
because theyre scared
because atom can do things
no other bot has ever done
but i cant do it

an epic battle being waged here tonight
as the fifth and final round
gets underway
come on atom
wait a second are you seeing this
charlie kenton is shadowboxing
just outside the ring
it looks like atom
has a shadow function
so basically
that means charlie kenton
is fighting the last round
of this fight against zeus
it doesnt seem to help because atom
is backed up against the ropes again
help him fight back
not yet
tak mashido supervising personally
as zeus hammers down
furiously trying to end this thing
