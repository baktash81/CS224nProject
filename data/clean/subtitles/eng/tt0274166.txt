with an automatic
never prematurely
shooting his load

no one s found any trace

service issue ballpoint

a pen that looked just like this 
completely innocent to the untrained
eye  but click it twice   
ah  english  there you are 
have you seen my secretary 
um    she went out 
um    shall we 
now  agent one believed that there was
a plot to steal the crown jewels 
they ve recently been through
a multimillion pound restoration 
largely paid for
by a corporate sponsor 
they re due to be unveiled
tonight at the tower of london 
the queen is insisting that the ceremony
goes ahead  so what we want you to   
hah  who    who   
who is the sponsor  sir

who owns a couple of prisons 
sauvage s  7 billion empire 
english 
operates over 400 prisons
in 60 countries 
  he s built 25 of them here 
  right  sir 
the man s related to the royal family 
for goodness  sake 
as far as the prime minister s
concerned  he s one of the
greatest friends england s got 
now  english  i want you at the tower

any chink in security

however slight 
must be plugged immediately

ladies and gentlemen 
mesdames est messieurs 
bienvenus  welcome tonight
to this wonderful occasion 
as we stand here
in the tower of london 
the most famous prison
in the world 
where these wonderful
jewels will rest safely   
under lock and key 
i want to thank you   
for giving me
this wonderful experience   
to contribute to the restoration
of these jewels 
it was  as we say in france 
le top  le best of 
  and what a beautiful   
it s colonel chevenix  he s got
a nasty wound  sir  who hit him 
the assailant 
he ran in here 
bough  you guard the door 
aha 
for god s sake  bough  don t come in 
the man s a maniac 
  you don t frighten me 
  missed 
  i ve managed to subdue the assailant 
the panic s over 
everything s under control 
thank you  and now 
ladies and gentlemen 
we should compose ourselves
for the arrival of her majesty   
and return to the site
of our great nation s   
magnificently restored
crown jewels 
i know 
i feel it too 
the very symbols
of our island nation 
so close we could almost
reach out and   
  pray silence
for her majesty the queen 
oh  where are the jewels 
it s an unmitigated disaster  english 
i couldn t agree more  sir 
well  we need to get these
jewels back  english  and fast 
tell me about this assailant 
when they searched the room 
there was no sign of him 
well  the man was clearly
a professional 
he must have escaped while
the queen was being sedated 
but he s the only lead we ve got 
we have to find him 
come in  this is   
this is roger from data support 
please sit down  he ll produce
a likeness based on your description 
so tell us 
what did this man look like 
um    well   
he was    big 
  hair color 
  um    orange 
  orange 
  mmm  and curly 
well  frizzy  actually 
frizzy sort of thing 
  frizzy 
  an eye patch 
broken nose 
very few teeth 
two  i would say 
at the most 
and a scar on his cheek   
in the shape    of a banana 
  which cheek 
  both cheeks 
they sort of met
in the middle 
are you sure
about this  english 
 oh  yes  that s him 
an uncanny resemblance 
why  it s just as if
he s in the room with us 
wow  look at this  sir 
got all the bells and whistles 
never mind about the gadgets 
just focus on the case 
oh  uh   
good morning  gentlemen 
thank you very much for waiting 
now  the question that faces us
this morning is a simple one 
namely  how did the thieves gain access
to this highly secure environment   
and then escape
with the jewels afterwards 
a simple question  but one
which i believe has a complex answer 
  actually  sir   
  uh  please  bough  my mind is at work 
now  what you must grasp  gentlemen 
is that the master criminal   
sees not a room
but a series of opportunities 
should i go in
through the window 
possibly 
  should i drop down from the ceiling 
  actually  sir   
there s one thing i think
we can be fairly confident about 
that is that they didn t
come up through the floor   
i ve got you  sir 
that s all right 
just come my way  bough 
  that ll bring me
right over the hole  sir 
  there s no need to panic 
can you see
the bottom yet  bough 
not yet  sir  the shaft
appears to be narrowing 
i m just a little bit worried
i might get stuck 
trust me  bough  you won t
get stuck if you just keep moving 
yes  sir 
i m okay  sir 
are you at the bottom
now  bough 
no  i am in fact
stuck now  sir 
oh  for god s sake  bough 
stay there  i m coming down 
uh  i m not especially sure
that s a good idea  sir 
don t worry 
be careful  sir 
gently does it 
  sir 
  are you all right  sir 
  yes  i landed on something quite soft 
  that was me  sir 
  oh  good 
what now 
there s no way back
up there  that s for sure 
but this must lead
somewhere 
i m slightly uncomfortable
in the dark  sir 
there s nothing
to worry about  bough 
  it may be pitch black 
but we can still see 
  can we  sir  how 
the bedouin monks of
the al maghreb mountains   
developed a system
of sonic chanting 
  i see  sir 
  the sound of their chanting   
would bounce back
off any obstacles 
and using their
highly tuned ears   
they could paint a mental picture
of the path ahead 
  brilliant  sir 
  however  you must always
sing in e flat 
e flat  e flat  e flat
thank you for the music
the songs i m singing
  is it working  sir 
  extremely well  thank you  bough 
thanks for all
the joy that   
  ow 
you all right  sir  i think
i can see something  sir 
oh  yeah  come on 
here is the long one 
it is a long one 
careful 
  i knew it 
  shall we call for backup  sir 
what  and watch some fat bottomed
bobby make our arrest for us 
i don t think so 
good morning  gentlemen 
ml7 at your service 
observe  bough  the dull
incompetence of the criminal mind 
it can never hope to match
our level of technical expertise 
  you ve got it 
  what do we do now  sir 
watch and learn  bough 
  they re too far ahead of us 
  have faith  bough 
they re heading south 
  there they are  sir 
  just as i thought 
  hang on tight  bough 
  we re never gonna catch them in this 
  take the wheel  bough 
i m getting in the aston 
  sir 
change places  bough 
i m getting out the other side 
sir 
set  bough 
take me up 
swing me out  bough 
  whoa 
  down 
  up  up 
sorry 
bough  pull out 
ow  ow 
those idiots
are right behind us  faster 
uh huh 
drop me here  bough 
ow  oh 
no  no  no 
oh  no  no  no  no  no  no 
 they re turning into
the brompton cemetery 
get here as soon as you can 
i m going in 
in a wheelchair  but geoffrey
overcame these terrible disabilities   
with that simple resilience
and sunny optimism   
that so warmed
all of us who knew him 
spending the rest of his life
in the service   
of the poor and disabled
of this parish 
it s very good 
really very good 
no  no  please go on 
i m sorry to interrupt 
  it s very entertaining 
  who s that 
that priest act of yours should keep the
other prisoners entertained for hours 
oh  i m so sorry  where are
my manners  johnny english 
british secret service 
and you are all under arrest 
i must say you ve done
this whole thing very well 
the attention to detail

you re very convincing 
oh  look  real tears 
do you get paid extra for that 
ahh  what
we re all here for 
i know  why don t we
take a look inside 
  oh  you ve nailed it down 
why would you do that 
i know you re gonna come back
in two weeks and dig it up again

little vignette of deceit and villainy 
i m the hearse driver

  yes  sir 
ah  aha

the most monumental cock up 
um  if you ll excuse me 
with the deepest respect 
utmost sympathy 
uh  he hasn t urinated
on anyone  has he 
  no

that s a blessing  are you

you see  200 years ago 
my family should have inherited
the throne of england 
but they were cast aside 
well  in a few
very short days 
it will be back
where it belongs 
with me 
shall i try it on 
yes  no  maybe 
to make you king  we need
the archbishop of canterbury to do that 
the archbishop of canterbury   
is being taken care of
even as we speak 
target acqui red
target locked
there s only one thing  sir 
what are we going to do about english 
if i were you  i wouldn t worry
too much about english 
he is no threat to us 
i had his flat bugged 
clearly  the aptly named
english is a fool 
he might be a fool  but he s
a fool who keeps showing up 
well  the next time
he shows up 
eliminate him 
thank you 
dieter klein
and klaus vendetta  sir 
released from prison six months ago 
327 convictions between them 
armed robbery 
grievous bodily harm   
and combined parking fines
of more than 400   
uh  yes  all right  thank you  bough 
i think we get the picture 
the point is  sir 
that vendetta and klein   
are both in the employ
of monsieur sauvage 
  pascal sauvage 
  precisely  sir 
but you re not suggesting
sauvage is involved 
i think he s more
than just involved  sir 
i m convinced he s
up to his french neck in it 
don t be absurd  sauvage
employs thousands of people 
just because two of them
are villains doesn t mean that he is 
i want him discounted from this
investigation immediately 
yes  sir 
all right  tonight i shall be
at sauvage s reception
for the new french ambassador 
any developments 
you can reach me there 
apart from that  i don t want you
within a hundred miles of the man 
absolutely  sir 
requisition order  ml7 quartermasters
for immediate supply 
one military transport plane 
fully fueled  with permission
for nighttime city over flight 
two night camouflage parachutes 
plus reserves  plus neoprene
bodysuits  twice  in black 
i ve never liked the navy blue 
and a 40 inch chest for me
 cause i need the sleeve length 
  morning  felch 
  morning 
oh  and two special forces
signet rings 
primed and color coded 
  what s all this for 
  for tonight s operation 
we re going to break into
sauvage s headquarters 
  but pegasus said   
  let me worry about pegasus 
i know that sauvage
is behind all this  and tonight
we re going to get the evidence 
  is something wrong  sir 
  did that sound like felch to you 
bough   
you  upstairs 
ow 
can you see him  bough 
he s on the upper level  sir 
got him 
and like a coiled viper   
he strikes 
so what you re saying  sir 
is there must have been two of them 
oh  at least  bough 
possibly four 
i wonder why
i didn t see them 
you mustn t dwell
on your mistakes 
  you must learn from them  then move on 
  yes  sir 
  so where were you  sir 
  just drop it  bough 
  aah  what is it  sir 
  that bike 
you get things
sorted out for tonight 
well  well  we meet again 
mr  english

i wondered when
you might show up again 
on the contrary  miss campbell  it is
not i who keeps showing up  it s you 
do you like sushi 
hmm 
oh  sushi  i practically
live off the stuff 
you might say the mysteries
of the orient are no mystery to me 
  sake 
  ah  sake 
cheers 
may all your daughters
be born with three bottoms 
now then  perhaps
you can explain how it is   
that i run into you
at two crime scenes   
and then can t find any record of you
on a single government computer 
shouldn t you ask
the government that 
i am the government
and i m asking you 
let me 
mmm  you re brave 
they say that sea urchin s
the ultimate acquired taste 
hmm  it s a personal
favorite of mine 
i think people are put off
by how it feeds through its bottom 
would you excuse me
for a moment 
excuse me  sorry  i m from ml7 
sorry  i m a secret agent 
  everything set  bough 
  just about  sir 
actually  sir  do you mind if i
run through the plan one more time 
  no  no 
  these are the two buildings here 
this one is our target  sauvage s
headquarters  next to city hospital 
i jump first and land
on the south side of the roof 
abseil down 14 floors and
cut through this window here 
 i then land on the east side
and abseil down 12 floors 
where you wait for my signal
that i ve disabled the alarm system 
  yes 
  you them break into this window here 
work your way along the secure corridor
and penetrate sauvage s office 
  yes  yes 
  is that okay  sir 
it s been okay ever since
i thought up the idea  bough 
oh  i nearly forgot  sir 
your laser beacon 
  my what 
  your laser beacon 
it ll guide you
onto sauvage s building 
your dependence on hardware
really does amuse me  bough 
i ve been dropped
into the kalahari desert   
carrying nothing more than a toothbrush
and a packet of sherbet lemons 
and i still found my way
to bulawayo before ramadan 
so thank you  bough 
but no thank you 
  bough  go 
geronimo 
  fandango 
ugh  ai yi yi 
right 
  alarm s disabled  sir 
roger that  bough 
this is worse
than i thought  bough 
sauvage has got some kind
of laboratory set up here 
god knows what kind
of sick operation he s running 
my god  what
have they done to you 
they ve taken
some of my blood 
  bastards 
  it s only for tests 
of course it is 
come on  my friend 
let s get you out of here
before they take anything else 
ah  good evening

come on  let s go 
come on  come on 
keep moving 
come on  over there  i know
what you re doing here  and you

to your evil paymaster 
  what are you talking about 
  you know exactly
what i m talking about 
where is the office
of pascal sauvage 
are you coming over here
in a minute  sir 
i m from ml7 
this has been a test of your
emergency response systems 
and i have to say
you ve all done extremely well 
right 
well  i ll leave you to it 
and  uh  get well soon 
oh  god 
sir  sir 
did you just land
on the wrong building 
i did a precautionary sweep
of the immediate environment 
right 
  and everything was fine 
  good 
okay  let s go 
i will be downstairs
at the reception   
  that s far enough 
  well  good evening 
  perhaps you d like this as well 
  what is it 
  let me show you 
  aah 
well executed  bough 
but completely redundant 
  how do you mean  sir 
  super strength muscle relaxant 
when he wakes up  he ll be
as floppy as a damp old sock 
what s this 
that s the face of
the archbishop of canterbury 
what are they doing 
 what s this got to do
with the crown jewels 
bough 
english 
a people whose empire
once covered   
one quarter of the surface
of the earth 
alas  no longer 
my friends ask me   pascal 
how can you be so interested   
in such a backward 
grotty little country  
my answer is simple 
the queen 
the queen has more power
in her tiny white gloves   
than any other head of state
in the entire world 
she can declare war
or make peace 
and most intriguingly   
she can seize any piece of land
which takes her fancy 
of course 
the queen never uses   
the enormous power
afforded to her 
but imagine someone
who would use that power 
imagine  say  me 
but how could he do that  sir 
how could he make himself king 
the archbishop 
ow 
hands up 
there s a good fellow 
heavily armed for a late night
at the office 
you fool  english  you ll never
get out of the building alive 
i d save your breath
for my questioning 
i m not telling you
anything 
incorrect 
sodium pentothal 
  i won t lie to you  it s a truth serum 
now then  why does sauvage
want to have himself crowned 
you have no idea
what s going on here  do you 
 it would be funny
if it wasn t so  pablibblit  
what 
  he s talking gibberish  sir 
  i can hear that 
  he s collapsed onto me  sir 
  i can see that 
  you don t think you could ve
got the syringes mixed up 
  what 
given the guard outside truth serum
and given klein the muscle relaxant 
aah 
don t be ridiculous  bough 
i think i know my right from my left 
  sir 
  oh  bugger it 
bough  take  flodd  
  take what  sir 
   flodd    schlage  
  i m not quite getting
that second word  sir 
   schlaaaagh  
  write it down  sir 
   schlaaaagh  
yes 
 c   c a    uh   
car  take the car 
we came by plane 
bugger off 
  hold it right there 
  what s wrong with them 
  i m not telling you 
wrong answer 
what is it with you two 
huh 
let s get outta here 
sorry  but who are you 
exactly 
special agent campbell 
i m attached to interpol in paris 
we ve been watching sauvage
for months 
why 
because every major convict released
from a sauvage prison in six months   
has been employed
by one of his companies 
we believe he s recruiting them
for a major criminal conspiracy 
  we just don t know what yet 
  what did he say 
  pegasus 
we have to report
to pegasus 
oh  no  sir 
no  no  no 
  how do we get out of here 
  hey  you two 
what you did to me
really hurt 
yeah  sorry about that  how do we
get out of here without being seen 
okay 
left by the fountain  right by the fire
exit  to the elevator at the end 
  thank you 
  oh  my god 
nice job  bough 
  left  sir  left 
 sir  you can t go
to sauvage s reception in this state 
the effect of the drug
has practically worn off

excuse me  sir 
i m very sorry to interrupt   
pascal  how nice
to see you again 
  enjoying the party 
  oh  splendid affair 
i was until i was informed
that your man english   
and his curious boyfriend here
have spent the evening   
breaking into my office
and assaulting my staff 
  is this true  bough 
  well  we    we   
what do you think
you re up to 
  sir  if i could just offer   
  go home  bough 
now 
i gave you direct orders
not to meddle with sauvage 
what do you do  break into his office
and assault two of his staff 
then you march in here 
loaded with god knows what 
and insult the foreign secretary 
i haven t encountered such
behavior in whitehall in 30 years 
  but   
  there are no  buts   english 
you re off the case  your security
clearance is hereby canceled 
after a three month leave of absence 
you will return at your old grade 
and i hope never
to hear your name again 
english has seen too much 
we go to plan  b  
get rid of
the fake archbishop   
and green light
the visit to her majesty 
then this pathetic country
can humiliate itself   
by crowning me officially 
the queen s resi dence
at sandri ngham
that s a letter
of abdication   
renouncing your claims
to the throne   
and the claims
of your entire family 
sign it 
never 
  yes 
prime minister  sorry to call so late 
but i m afraid the queen is abdicating 
what 
abdicated 
but that s not possible 
i only wish that were true 
  let me talk to her  maybe she just   
  pascal  she s gone 
my people have spent
the last 10 hours   
trying to track down
the rightful heir to the throne   
and they ve come up with a name 
which they ve double checked 
who is it 
  it s you 
  no 
 in the wake
of the return of the crown jewels   
to a police station
in north london 
pascal sauvage has requested
that his coronation   
take place
this thursday 
in the house  the prime minister said he
was looking forward to the ceremony   
and he believed that monsieur sauvage
will make a fine king   
and will bring all that is
best about modern europe
to our ancient institutions 
get your car keys 
we ve got work to do 
  miss campbell 
  sauvage is heading back to france 
he s invited 13 of
the richest criminal masterminds
in the world to meet him there 
i m sorry  miss campbell 
i m off the case 
it s been reassigned 
i know 
reassigned to me 
  i want you with me 
  just leave me alone 
are you gonna sit here in this
grotty flat feeling sorry for yourself 
or are you gonna get out there
and save your country 
i m gonna sit in the flat 
  johnny  this is ridiculous 
  i m a spent force 
spent  my ass 
ow 
will    you   
please    stop 
i ll just be a minute 
northern france
it ll be nightfall in an hour 
then we can strike out for the chateau 
the fact is  the moment sauvage
gets that crown on his head 
he ll be able to do whatever he likes
with the country that i love 
and that is why you and i
have got to stop him 
  relishing the thought 
  something like that 
i suppose you ve made love
to lots of women  haven t you  johnny 
uh   
uh  well  you know 
one does one s best 
it s just   
well  it s been three years
since my fiancé left me 
and since then i haven t
made love to anyone 
but then i met you   
and i felt this   
hunger   
deep down inside 
i wanted to say things to you 
i wanted to do things to you   
that i haven t wanted to do
in a very  very  very long time 
what  uh   
what sort of things
are we talking about 
things like
punching you in the face 
kicking you in the backside for being
such a pompous  know nothing asshole 
but then i started to see beyond
the idiot that everybody else saw 
i started to see
the man on the inside   
who was determined to do his duty 
no matter what or who lay in his way 
and i began to feel
other things for him 
to want to do
other things for him 
things   
involving plastic toys
and soft cheese 
  what 
  what  what 
you re toying with me 
you re telling me to stop in
the gentlest way you know how 
no  n n no   
you re such a special person   
not to take advantage of me
while i m vulnerable 
  n no    well   
  so thank you   
for being such a gentleman 
not at all 
i know what you re thinking 
miss campbell 
if we don t pull this off  god knows
what might happen to england 
actually  i was thinking there must be
a better way in than that pipe 
well  there isn t 
i ve analyzed it from every angle 
and this is the best option 
i ll go in first  and if it s a clear
way through  i ll call down 
johnny 
  be careful 
  i m always careful 
ohh 
  gentlemen 
in a few hours time   
i will become
the next king of england 
oh  no 
hyah   
  how did you get here 
  up the ladder 
pull yourself together 
it s only a bit of poo 
oh  oh  it s cold 
it s cold 
what is the one commodity   
the world never seems
to run out of 
criminals  gentlemen 
  lawbreakers 
every nation in the world
struggles   
with the issue
of overcrowded prisons 
so  what do we do
with all these villains 
find the solution
to that problem   
and the governments of the world
would pay you through their nose 
fortunately 
i have found a solution 
we empty every prison
on the entire planet 
we take the resulting
tidal wave of human scum   
and we put it here 
the moment
i am crowned king 
i will turn england
into the largest prison   
in the history
of the world 
210 000 square miles   
of prime real estate   
conveniently separated
from true civilization   
by 20 miles of ocean   
  and soon to be available   
  come on 
for the entire world
to dump its human waste in 
according to
current projections 
we will not run out of prison space
for the next 500 years 
so  tonight one 
and only one  of you   
will leave here
owning 49 percent   
of this venture 
so that s his little game 
we must get hold of that dvd 
but how  johnny 
there s only two of us 
you re young  miss campbell 
and inexperienced 
what you seem to
have forgotten is that   
nobody knows we are here 
at our disposal we have
the vital element of surprise 
now  my plan is simple
but effective 
i shall drop from the gallery
at this end of the room
and take sauvage prisoner 
you will then enter from the far door 
cutting off any means of escape 
then  using sauvage as a hostage 
we ll get the hell out of here  clear 
get  em up 
you french ponce 
but  mr  english 
i m gob smacked 
what an unexpected surprise 
surprises are very much
my speciality  sauvage 
i think we ve seen
enough of this 
i know exactly what you re planning 
and i m here to put a stop to it 
my bottom will be king of england
before you are 
wrong again 
perhaps you d care
to look behind you 
oh  please 
lorna 
i m sorry  johnny 
well  i m afraid
that we ll have to   
conclude the floor show
for tonight 
not so fast  sauvage 
you may have taken me 
but you ll never take england 
not as long as i have
breath in my body   
or a bullet in my gun 
you know  mr  english 
i m going to miss you  really 
you re very entertaining 
i thank you 
take them away 
good morning  everybody 
and welcome to
the breakfast show 
as the crowds are gathering here for
the crowning of our first french king   
since the year 1066 
call here at london fm with the top ten
things you most love about the french 
we haven t had
any calls yet  uh  at all 
but the lines are still open
and i ll give you that number again   
0 2 0 7   
zero  deux  zero  sept   
this is not good 
johnny 
we ve got to think
of something 
wait a minute  i ve got an idea 
hop  hop 
and hop  and hop 
and stop 
now  are you familiar   
with the shaman throat warblers
of the guatemalan delta 
what 
it has long been
their belief   
that a whistle pitched at the precise
resonant frequency of a metal lock   
will vibrate the levers in such a way
that the door will simply swing open 
unbelievable 
  and kneel 
right  here goes 
  i can t hear anything 
  i m into ultrasonic 
will you just stop all this
and face facts 
we ve failed  the only thing
that can save us now is a miracle 
it worked 
  ohh 
  sir 
i don t know why you hauled yourself up
that dreadful poo tube  bough 
when there was a perfectly good ladder
right beside it 
now  sauvage may have
fooled the country   
with his fake archbishop
and his secret agenda 
but he hasn t fooled me 
  so  here s the plan 
let all good people
rejoice
rejoice
  rejoice
  aaah 
let all good people
rejoice
rejoice
rejoice
rejoice
rejoice
rejoice
and sing
sirs  you are hereby called
to witness the anointing   
of your one true lord
and future king pascal 
pascal  are you willing
to take the oath 
i am willing 
then be thou anointed   
with this holy oil 
and do you  the chosen bishops
of england  scotland and wales 
ascent to this anointing 
for scotland  i do 
for wales  i do 
for england  i do not 
  english 
that man must not be crowned king
because he is   
a fraudster  a charlatan
and a thief 
no  please 
let him speak 
it is this man 
pascal sauvage 
who stole the crown jewels 
who forced the queen
to abdicate   
and who would kill anyone
who got in his way 
it is the end 
herr english 
 he has cheated 
conned and manipulated   
this great country
for his own ends 
he s fooled you all 
what s more 
this whole ceremony is a sham   
because that man
standing in front of you   
is not the archbishop
of canterbury 
english  a word of advice 
don t go there 
shut it  frenchy  i ll go
wherever i damn well please 
  now take it off 
  what 
your face
is made of plastic 
remove it at once 
i have no idea
what you re talking about 
right  i ll just have to
remove it myself 
come on 
  maybe it pulls up from the front 
come on  you 
  aaah 
  thank you very much 
must be a join here
somewhere 
fascinating performance
as always  monsieur english 
but i m afraid
we must move on 
nobody s moving anywhere until i m
finished with this piece of low life 
do you or do you you not   
have tattooed on your bottom
the words 
 jesus is coming   
look busy  
  are you insane

  but there s more 
  but not  i m afraid  today 
sergeant  please
take this man away 
  but be gentle with him 
  do you think that s it 
you think i don t have
more evidence 
my loyal subordinate
is standing by with a dvd   
which shows sauvage s
hideous plans for this country 
get him out 
get him out of here 
  play it  bough  play the disk

by zadok the priest
and nathan the prophet 
so be thou anointed   
and consecrated king   
over all the peoples   
whom the lord thy god   
hath given thee to govern   
and of all your possessions 
wherever they may be 
and so 
in the name of the father   
and of the son   
and of the holy ghost 
i crown you

  never in a million years  sauvage 
  give it to me

of the father

and lock him away 
god save the king

ma am   
 in celebration
of her return to the throne 
the queen has declared august 5
a national holiday   
and has conferred a knighthood
on the unnamed ml7 agent   
responsible for foiling the plot
of french businessman pascal sauvage 
mr  sauvage is now awaiting trial
for high treason 
a crime which still
carries the death penalty 
if found guilty  he s asked that his
brain be donated to medical science   
to further research into the causes
of hyper manic schizophrenia 
meanwhile  the unnamed english agent
has left the country   
and has already embarked
on his next challenging mission 
somewhere
i n the south of france
