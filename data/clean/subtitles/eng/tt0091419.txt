  l started life as an orphan
a child of the street

 you can t 
kaput  extinct  l m closing this
god and customer forsaken place 
mr  mushnik  forgive me for saying so 
but has it ever occurred to you   
   that maybe what the firm needs is
to move in a new direction 
what seymour s trying to say is    
seymour  why don t you run downstairs
and bring up   
   that strange and interesting new plant
you ve been working on 
some of those exotic plants
seymour s been tinkering around with   
   are really unusual 
we thought that maybe some of those
strange and interesting new plants   
   prominently displayed and advertised 
would attract business 
l m afraid it isn t feeling very well today 
there  now  isn t that bizarre 
at least 
what kind of a weirdo plant is that 
l don t know 
l think it s some kind of flytrap   
   but l haven t been able to identify it
in any of my books 
l gave it my own name though 
l call it an audrey ll 
after me 
l hope you don t mind 
sir  if you were to put
a strange and interesting plant like this   
   here in the window  then maybe    
maybe what  maybe what 
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound 
just because you put a strange plant
in the window people don t suddenly  
excuse me  l couldn t help noticing
that strange and interesting plant 
what is it 
lt s an audrey ll 
l ve never seen anything like it before 
no one has 
where did you get it 
remember that total eclipse of the sun
about a week ago 
i was walking
in the wholesale flower district that day 
and i passed by this place
where this old chinese man    
he sometimes sells me
weird and exotic cuttings 
 cause he knows strange plants
are my hobby 
he didn t have anything unusual
there that day 
so i wasjust about to 
you know  walk on by   
   when suddenly and without warning 
there was this   
   total eclipse of the sun 
it got very dark 
and there was this strange humming
sound  like something from another world 
when the light came back 
this weird plant wasjust sitting there 
just stuck in among the zinnias 
  audrey ll   
i could have sworn
it hadn t been there before   
   but the old chinese man
sold it to me anyways   
   for  1 95 
well  that s an unusual story 
and a fascinating plant 
oh  while l m here 
l might as well take  50 worth of roses 
 50 
can you break  100 
 100 
no 
then l ll just have to take twice as many 
twice as many 
twice as many 
twice as many 
that plant in the window 
it s simply amazing 
that plant in the window 
wherever did you get it 
 there it is  marge 
 oh  my gosh  it s peculiar 
thank you very much  sir 
thank you 
thank you  come again 
come and look at the weirdo plant
some more 
lt s just going to get bigger
and more interesting 
just don t stand there  quick  quick 
put the plant back     what did you call it 
audrey ll 
put that audrey ll back in the window
where passersby can see it 
l never thought this could happen 
l m taking us all out to dinner tonight

   seymour krelborn  ls that correct 
who has discovered a new breed of plant
unknown on this planet 
let me play you down
to your seat  seymour 
hello  seymour 
hello  wink 
l wish you folks at home could see this 
seymour  where did you get
such a weird plant 
well  you remember that total eclipse
of the sun about a week ago 
and thus we conclude our interview
with the young botanical  
mind if i call you a genius 
gosh  no 
the genius who has discovered
this amazing  unidentified plant 
i d like to remind our listeners
that the audrey ii is on display   
   exclusively at
mushnik s skid row florists 
 did l miss it 
 mushnik s 
the address

oh  well  lt s still good advertising 
seymour s first radio broadcast 
l wanted to hear it so bad 
l tried to be on time  but  
don t tell me  you got tied up 
no  just handcuffed  a little 
girl  hey  girl 
the mess you hang out with
is hazardous to your health 
that s for sure  but l can t leave him 
 why not 
 he d get angry 
lf he does this when he likes me 
imagine what he d do if he ever got mad 
so  dump the chump 
get a guy who ll protect you 
how about the little jerk with the glasses 
seymour 
oh  we re just friends 
l don t even deserve a sweet  considerate   
   suddenly successful guy like seymour 
that poor child suffers
from low self image 
 you got a point 
 she got a problem 
  l know seymour s the greatest
  but l m dating a semi sadist
  so l got a black eye
and my arm s in a cast
  still that seymour s a cutie
  well  if not  he s got inner beauty
  and l dream of a place
  where we could be together at last
  a matchbox of our own
  a fence of real chain link
  a grill out on the patio
  disposal in the sink
  a washer and a dryer
  and an ironing machine
  ln a tract house that we share
  somewhere that s green
  he rakes and trims the grass
  he loves to mow and weed
  l cook like betty crocker
  and l look like   
     donna reed
  there s plastic on the furniture
  to keep it neat and clean
  ln the pine sol scented air
  somewhere that s green
  somewhere that s green
  between our frozen dinner
  and our bedtime  9 15
  we snuggle watching lucy
  on our big  enormous   
     12 inch screen
  l m his december bride
  he s father  he knows best
  the kids play howdy doody
  as the sun sets in the west
  a picture out of better homes   
     and gardens magazine
  far from skid row
  l dream we ll go
  somewhere that s   
     green  
  poor seymour pushed a broom
nothing in his news but gloom and doom
  then he lit a fuse and give him room
he started an explosion  holy cow
  that thing went bang kerboom
and he s having some fun now
   some fun now
 hot damn 
   ain t he having some fun now 
 yes  ma am
  he s having some fun now
  ain t he having some fun now

our biggest funeral account 
a huge family  dropping off like flies 
sometimes l think mr  mushnik s
too hard on you  glue 
that s okay 
 l owe him everything 
 glitter 
he took me out
of the skid row home for boys   
   gave me a warm place to stay 
floors to sweep  toilets to clean   
   and every other sunday off 
you know  l think you ought
to raise your expectations 
now that you re getting successful  l mean 
lt s clear you suffer from a low self image 
lt s high time you get it fixed

people think she shouldn t be working 
l go to her because l m just
incredibly devoted to her strength

lf you tell her where it is  the problem 
she eventually finds it and she does it 
l wish l had that stamina 
l can only go so long

l don t ever want to have to be just  
comfy 
yes  doctor 
l remember the first time
l went to a dentist

lf only l were a dentist   
the dentist l went to had the greatest car 
he had a corvette  everybody calls him
  doctor   and he s not really a doctor 
oh  my god 
l got out of there okay 
but after it was all finished   
   they gave me a candy bar

if something had happened to him 
seymour  what a thing to say

lf he met with foul play
or some terrible accident of some kind   
   it d be partly my fault just because   
   secretly l wished it

ln the gutter 
the gutter 
the gutter  lt s a nightspot 
l worked there on my nights off
when we weren t making much money 
l d put on   
   cheap and tasteless outfits 
not nice ones like this 
low and nasty apparel

meanwhile  l would keep the plant 
the plant

give me your secret gardening tips 
but then  if you d rather hang    
what do l have to do 
just feed it 
feed it what 
minerals 
thursdays  you should give it water 
but whatever you do
