what seymours trying to say is
seymour why dont you run downstairs
and bring up
that strange and interesting new plant
youve been working on
some of those exotic plants
seymours been tinkering around with

we thought that maybe some of those
strange and interesting new plants
prominently displayed and advertised
would attract business
lm afraid it isnt feeling very well today
there now isnt that bizarre
at least
what kind of a weirdo plant is that
l dont know
l think its some kind of flytrap
but l havent been able to identify it
in any of my books
l gave it my own name though

after me
l hope you dont mind
sir if you were to put
a strange and interesting plant like this
here in the window then maybe

just because you put a strange plant
in the window people dont suddenly
excuse me l couldnt help noticing
that strange and interesting plant
what is it
lts an audrey ll
lve never seen anything like it before
no one has
where did you get it
remember that total eclipse of the sun
about a week ago
i was walking
in the wholesale flower district that day
and i passed by this place
where this old chinese man
he sometimes sells me
weird and exotic cuttings
cause he knows strange plants
are my hobby
he didnt have anything unusual
there that day
so i wasjust about to
you know walk on by
when suddenly and without warning
there was this
total eclipse of the sun
it got very dark
and there was this strange humming
sound like something from another world
when the light came back
this weird plant wasjust sitting there
just stuck in among the zinnias
audrey ll
i could have sworn
it hadnt been there before
but the old chinese man
sold it to me anyways
for 195
well thats an unusual story
and a fascinating plant
oh while lm here
l might as well take 50 worth of roses
can you break 100
no
then lll just have to take twice as many
twice as many
twice as many
twice as many

l know seymours the greatest
but lm dating a semisadist
so l got a black eye
and my arms in a cast
still that seymours a cutie
well if not hes got inner beauty
and l dream of a place
where we could be together at last
a matchbox of our own
a fence of real chainlink
a grill out on the patio
disposal in the sink
a washer and a dryer
and an ironing machine
ln a tract house that we share
somewhere thats green
he rakes and trims the grass
he loves to mow and weed
l cook like betty crocker
and l look like
donna reed
theres plastic on the furniture
to keep it neat and clean
ln the pinesol scented air
somewhere thats green
somewhere thats green
between our frozen dinner
and our bedtime 915
we snuggle watching lucy
on our big enormous
12inch screen
lm his december bride
hes father he knows best
the kids play howdy doody
as the sun sets in the west
a picture out of better homes
and gardens magazine
far from skid row
l dream well go
somewhere thats
green
poor seymour pushed a broom
nothing in his news but gloom and doom
then he lit a fuse and give him room
he started an explosion holy cow
that thing went bang kerboom
and hes having some fun now
some fun now

she eventually finds it and she does it
l wish l had that stamina
l can only go so long

they think
l cant even think about what they think
dont cry audrey
would it be so terrible
if something had happened to him
seymour what a thing to say
well would it
lt wouldnt be terrible at all
ltd be a miracle
not to mention all the money ld save
on epsom salts and ace bandages
you see
but ld still feel guilty
lf he met with foul play
or some terrible accident of some kind
itd be partly my fault just because
secretly l wished it
dont you waste another minute
thinking about that creep
theres a lot of guys thatd give anything
to go out with you
nice guys
l dont deserve a nice guy seymour
thats not true
you dont know the half of it
lve led a terrible life
l deserved a creep like orin scrivello dds

you could lay low for a while
say 30 40 years
meanwhile l would keep the plant
the plant
of course youd have to teach me
how to take care of it while youre away
give me your secret gardening tips
but then if youd rather hang
what do l have to do

feed it what
minerals
thursdays you should give it water
but whatever you do
yes
