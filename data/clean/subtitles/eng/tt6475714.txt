thank you
thank you
dont thank me yet
enjoying the show
this one must have come from the sky
what
what is that
palico
my friend tells me i misjudged you
i may even owe you an apology
just dont hold your breath
why did you put me in chains
what are you so afraid of
your world
and what it could do to mine
you arent the first to cross over
from your world there were others
long time ago
thats how you speak my language
i made a study of it
what happened to me
how did i get here
i believe that the answers
we both seek lie here
at the peak of that mountain lies
the sky tower
remnants of an ancient civilization
very advanced very dangerous
it is said that the ancients knew
how to travel between both worlds
i believe that is the purpose
of the sky tower
that is what brought you here
what happened
to this ancient civilization
they destroyed themselves
their technology turned on them
you think my world had something
to do with it
i suspect but an open gateway
between our two worlds
was catastrophic once
i intend to make sure
that doesnt happen again
we were on our way
to investigate the sky tower
when we strayed into the diablos
thats where i lost my friend here
tending to the wounded and repairing
the ship was our first priority
but now we resume our mission
the ancients would guard their technology
with the most fearsome of creatures
a rathalos
almost impossible to kill
their only weakness is
just before they breathe fire
you help us with the battle ahead
perhaps we can help you get home
whats the matter
you dont have cats in your world
hey
you been drinking from my mug again
we leave at dawn
and dont keep me waiting
i hate waiting
so you ready
we got a hard climb ahead of us
come on
we believe that the lava powers
the machinery within the tower
its controlling the storm
exactly
its creating a gateway to your world
but it looks unstable
lets go
its glass
estas bone rathalos
rathalos
prepare yourself remember theyre weak
just before they breathe fire
hey ugly
its okay its okay
youre safe now get the medic
captain artemis
