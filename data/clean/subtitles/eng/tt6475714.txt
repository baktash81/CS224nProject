thank you 
thank you 
don t thank me yet 
enjoying the show 
this one must have come from the sky 
what 
what is that 
palico 
my friend tells me i misjudged you 
i may even owe you an apology 
just don t hold your breath 
why did you put me in chains 
what are you so afraid of 
your world   
and what it could do to mine 
you aren t the first to cross over
from your world  there were others 
long time ago 
that s how you speak my language 
  i made a study of it 
  what happened to me 
how did i get here 
i believe that the answers
we both seek lie here 
at the peak of that mountain lies
the sky tower 
remnants of an ancient civilization 
very advanced  very dangerous 
it is said that the ancients knew
how to travel between both worlds 
i believe that is the purpose
of the sky tower 
that is what brought you here 
what happened
to this ancient civilization 
they destroyed themselves 
their technology turned on them 
you think my world had something
to do with it 
i suspect  but an open gateway
between our two worlds
was catastrophic once 
i intend to make sure
that doesn t happen again 
we were on our way
to investigate the sky tower
when we strayed into the diablos 
that s where i lost my friend here 
tending to the wounded and repairing
the ship was our first priority 
but now we resume our mission 
the ancients would guard their technology
with the most fearsome of creatures 
a rathalos 
almost impossible to kill 
their only weakness is
just before they breathe fire 
you help us with the battle ahead 
perhaps we can help you get home 
what s the matter 
you don t have cats in your world 
hey 
you been drinking from my mug again 
we leave at dawn 
and don t keep me waiting 
i hate waiting 
so  you ready 
we got a hard climb ahead of us 
come on 
we believe that the lava powers
the machinery within the tower 
it s controlling the storm 
exactly 
it s creating a gateway to your world 
but it looks unstable 
let s go 
it s glass 
estas bone rathalos 
rathalos 
prepare yourself  remember  they re weak
just before they breathe fire 
hey  ugly 
it s okay  it s okay 
you re safe now  get the medic 
captain artemis 
let s get her inside  up 
let s go  let s go 
captain  we ve been searching for you 
what the hell is she wearing 
falcon main  this is red wolf 
we ve made contact with dark star 
we have a lone survivor

ground forces are securing the area
