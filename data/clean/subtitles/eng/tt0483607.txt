began with a single
microscopic organism
its human nature to seek even
the smallest comfort in reason
or logic for events
as catastrophic as these
but a virus doesnt
choose a time or place
it doesnt hate
or even care
screaming
it just happens
horn blaring
helicopter whirring
people shouting
man on megaphone
go back to your homes
kane the reaper virus
spread among the population
of glasgow
like a common cold
there was no stopping it
no cure no vaccine
it claimed the lives
of thousands in
the first week
this is the end of the world
kane in an attempt
to quell the outbreak
martial law was implemented
roadblocks set up
curfews enforced
katherine come on darling
we have to walk now
the airports seaports
and borders were closed
scotland was placed
under quarantine
the people were ordered
to stay in their homes to
avoid travel avoid contact
to sit it out
and wait for help

shouting

kane the wall
stood 30 feet high
clad in steel armor plating
it followed the line of
the ancient roman frontier
2000 years before
spanning 18 miles
east coast to west
cutting britain in half
coastal waters were mined
and patrolled the skies
were declared a nofly zone
and orders were given to
shoot down any aircraft in
violation of the quarantine
the idea was simple
nobody came out
and nobody went in
they neednt have worried
about the second part
those abandoned within
the quarantine zone
were left to die
social order decayed
along with the corpses
the streets ran with blood
as the people fought
to stay alive
the bodies burned
in their thousands looting
rape and murder became rife
fire spread as the cities
were plundered
and the last to die
became primal savages
feeding on dogs rats
and finally on each other
as the weeks turned to months
the funeral pyres
faded and died
in time all the lights
burned out
consigning the country north
of the wall first to memory
and eventually to history
but just as the government
had turned its back
on the hot zone
so the rest of the world
turned its back on britain
with hundreds of thousands
unemployed homeless
and destitute
the situation has reached
breaking point
it now remains only
a matter of time
before the laws of nature
seek to redress the balance
targets are in play

canaris
prime minister
how long
two hours ago
well
dds were carrying out
a routine drugs raid
when they found
the infected victims
its the reaper virus
oh my god
its back
bloody hell george
whats got your
knickers in a twist
national emergency
im afraid briefing for
the pm in five minutes
hatcher lets keep this
informal and to the point
we all know whats at stake
why youre here
jane
in 2023 when the rising
tidal waters were threatening
to flood london
we extended the thames
flood barrier
like a castle moat
this system of canals
encircles the entire capital
north of the river
our immediate plan is to
flood the canals blockade
all bridges tube lines
and rail links
in and out of the city
you want to put
12 million people
under lock and key
containment is our absolute
priority we must implement
martial law now
keep the people
off the streets
while we secure the blockade
and set up medical stations
only then can we begin
the evacuation
hatcher do it
its all very well packing
people into their homes
like so many
million sardines
but you drop a killer virus
into that mix
and this town
is gonna go titsup
in no short order
once you start stacking
bodies in the streets
therell be panic
public disorder
looting rape murder
and thats just for starters
the death toll will
be unimaginable
and by that time
therell be absolutely
fuckall we can do about it
you have to think
of the millions that
well be saving
are you talking about people
or pound notes
chief nelson
would you join me
in my office
if this is a bollocking
make it quick
ive got a job to do
i need to be out there
on the streets
michael
what were about to show you
is highly confidential
and potentially
volatile material
when the wall went up
the government at that
time naturally
wanted to know
what was happening
on the other side
so they retasked one of
their military satellites
to provide coverage
of edinburgh and glasgow
for the past 30 years
its carried on
taking pictures
sending down what youd
expect empty cities
deserted streets
that is
until three years ago
when these turned up
hatcher people
on the streets of glasgow
survivors
what else could it be
and if there are survivors
there must surely be a cure
what we have to do
is get our hands on it
we already have
a team standing by
all we need is somebody
to lead them
someone to take them in
find the cure
and deliver it into our hands
before its too late
to turn the tide
you dont know how many
survivors there are
and the team might not find
them in time they might
not find them at all
and they could
still be contagious
thats what the teams
going to find out
youve known for
three fucking years
that they were up there
but you swept it
under the carpet
scotlands dead
have long since
been laid to rest
yesterday if i turned up
on the 600 news with
a survivor in tow
theyd have strung me up
from the nearest lamppost
by the balls
but if in 48 hours
i arrive with a survivor
and a cure
sure they wont
give a flying fuck
about the survivor
but theyll be lining up
to kiss my arse
for that cure
in politics
survival is timing
and ours is running out
we have 48 hours
i need your best man
on this right away
all right
i know someone who might
just fit the bill
get in the car
its pissing down
how long have they known
long enough
but that doesnt matter now
matters to me
there are survivors
out there
this is not some
personal quest
im sending you on
focus on your mission
whos behind it hatcher
hatchers got the swagger
and the smiles but its
canaris who pulls the strings
hes the power
behind the throne
and hes not someone
you want to pick
a fight with
who me
im serious
if the truth got out
it would bring hatcher
the government
the whole fucking
system down
and theres no way
canaris is ever gonna
let that happen
once youre over that wall
theres no rules
no backup
better that way
look after this for me
would you
dont suppose
you got a cigarette
theres no smoking
on the helicopter
and i dont smoke
fair enough
dr marcus kane
he was leading
the research into the virus
when the gates were closed
he was trapped
inside the hot zone
his lab was located inside
the quarantine compound
in glasgow
if anybody was capable
of developing a cure
it was him
i suggest you start
at the lab pick up
the trail from there
youll rendezvous with
the rest of the team
at the wall
then youll proceed north
in two armored transports
scotland is still why not fly in
a nofly zone
hatcher needs to keep this
as low profile as possible
so if we dont make it out
no one will know we went in
youve got 46 hours
if you dont make it back
the city of london
and everybody in it
will be left to die
if its there
ill find it
youll need this its a gps
locator beacon itll tell us
exactly where you are
well have a gun ship
standing by to extract
your team
so much for low profile
once you have the cure
it wont matter
what happens if i dont
find anything up there
then you neednt
bother coming back
man on pa
for your own safety
return to your homes
east london
is under martial law
car horns honking
people clamoring
what the hell are we
going to do canaris
just calm down
and listen
even if
by some miracle
sinclair finds
what shes looking for
and makes it back in time
the fact remains
this is our fault
we made it happen
too many people crammed
into ghettos so tight
they can barely move
we created the perfect
breeding ground
for a virus to take place
and the more we save now
the more chance there is
of the same thing
happening all over again
now we have an opportunity
to buy ourselves
breathing room
what exactly are
you suggesting
were at war prime minister
its basic combat triage
leave the dying to die
with the whole
world watching
with a lie this big
we can get away with
anything we want
major sinclair
good flight
fine
sergeant norton
welcome to nomans land
why call it that
theres not another living
soul for miles south of
that wall except us
what about
the sentries

was fully automated
about 20 years ago
nowadays they only
expend their ammo
on the local wildlife
a team arrived two hours
ago theyre prepping
their gear inside

a night on the town
whered they
find these things
read they patrolled
the hot zone just
north of the wall
when the system was
automated most of them

thats right
how do you do major
i took over in 24
stirling joined me in 31
until hatcher
in his infinite wisdom
decided to pull the plug
on the whole program
three years ago
tried everything of course
just couldnt crack it

get back inside
you know that dr kane
was the best man
in his field
his papers on virus research
were required reading when
i was in medical school
basically he taught me
everything i know
but i never actually
met the man
this files been
closed for 25 years
the government tried
to suppress any information
getting out of the hot zone
didnt want people to
know how bad things
had got up there
kane on recording
i dont think we can
stay here much longer
morality has abandoned
these people the killing
seems he dug in
with a bunch of
stranded soldiers
fortified the hospital
as best they could
kept up regular reports
on the army frequency
using their coms set
till the power
went out permanently
kane the fires have spread
the power supply is dwindling
and our food and water
are running out fast
at night we can hear
the distant cries
of pain and anguish
theyve begun
to feed off each other
its medieval out there
ammunition is low
the barricades wont
hold out much longer
our time has run out
this is dr marcus kane
signing off
what do the
numbers mean
sinclair its the number
of people in each house
that needed saving
they were told
to stay in their homes
that help would come
clear
stirling
what do you know
about line of fire
im a lab hound
not a combat surgeon
thats all we need
line of fire is the air
between the target
and the weapon
through which the bullet
travels very fast

place you want to
be in a fire fight
if anything happens
you get behind me quick

a matter of time
before they sent someone
to answer to the question
why are you alive
when you should be dead
thats what you want
to know isnt it
ow
answer him
something along those lines
leave us
the answer is easy
in the land of the infected
the immune man is king
so if this is
just a power trip
why stay hidden
why not show yourselves
you think we chose
to cast off the apparel
of our former existence
no no no
we didnt choose anything
we were delivered
these walls around you
they were built to last
and so shall we
what weve built here
from the ashes is pure blood
uninfected by
the outside world
until now
have you found the cure
laughs
even now you still
cling to hope
if i were you
i would abandon
any such thoughts
theres always hope
but there is no cure
there never was
we had prevailed here
not because of science
but through natural selection
survival of the fittest
we have earned
the right to live here
purged of the likes of you
take them away
dont you even want
to know why were here
exclaims
that youre here at all
is sin enough
its the reaper virus
