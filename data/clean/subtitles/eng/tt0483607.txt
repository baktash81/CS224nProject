began with a single
microscopic organism 
it s human nature to seek even
the smallest comfort in reason
or logic for events
as catastrophic as these 
but a virus doesn t
choose a time or place 
it doesn t hate
or even care 
 screaming 
it just happens 
 horn blaring 
 helicopter whirring 
 people shouting 
man on megaphone 
go back to your homes 
kane  the reaper virus
spread among the population
of glasgow
like a common cold 
there was no stopping it 
no cure  no vaccine 
it claimed the lives
of thousands in
the first week 
this is the end of the world 
kane  in an attempt
to quell the outbreak 
martial law was implemented 
roadblocks set up 
curfews enforced 
katherine  come on  darling 
we have to walk now 
the airports  seaports
and borders were closed 
scotland was placed
under quarantine 
the people were ordered
to stay in their homes  to
avoid travel  avoid contact 
to sit it out
and wait for help
that did not come 
 all clamoring 
 shouting 
stay back 
you got to
let us through 
get out of the way  move

kane  the wall
stood 30 feet high 
clad in steel armor plating 
it followed the line of
the ancient roman frontier 
2 000 years before 
spanning 18 miles 
east coast to west 
cutting britain in half 
coastal waters were mined
and patrolled  the skies
were declared a no fly zone 
and orders were given to
shoot down any aircraft in
violation of the quarantine 
the idea was simple 
nobody came out 
and nobody went in 
they needn t have worried
about the second part 
those abandoned within
the quarantine zone
were left to die 
social order decayed
along with the corpses 
the streets ran with blood
as the people fought
to stay alive 
the bodies burned
in their thousands  looting 
rape and murder became rife 
fire spread as the cities
were plundered 
and the last to die
became primal savages 
feeding on dogs  rats
and finally  on each other 
as the weeks turned to months 
the funeral pyres
faded and died 
in time  all the lights
burned out 
consigning the country north
of the wall first to memory
and eventually to history 
but just as the government
had turned its back
on the hot zone 
so the rest of the world
turned its back on britain 
with hundreds of thousands
unemployed  homeless
and destitute 
the situation has reached
breaking point 
it now remains only
a matter of time
before the laws of nature
seek to redress the balance 
targets are in play

 all groaning

 elevator bell dings 
thank you  captain 
that will be all 
sir 
canaris 
prime minister 
how long 
two hours ago 
well 
dds were carrying out
a routine drugs raid
when they found
the infected victims 
it s the reaper virus 
oh  my god 
it s back 
bloody hell  george 
what s got your
knickers in a twist 
national emergency 
i m afraid  briefing for
the pm in five minutes 
hatcher  let s keep this
informal and to the point 
we all know what s at stake 
why you re here 
jane 
in 2023  when the rising
tidal waters were threatening
to flood london 
we extended the thames
flood barrier 
like a castle moat 
this system of canals
encircles the entire capital
north of the river 
our immediate plan is to
flood the canals  blockade
all bridges  tube lines
and rail links
in and out of the city 
you want to put
12 million people
under lock and key 
containment is our absolute
priority  we must implement
martial law now 
keep the people
off the streets
while we secure the blockade
and set up medical stations 
only then can we begin
the evacuation 
hatcher  do it 
it s all very well packing
people into their homes
like so many
million sardines 
but you drop a killer virus
into that mix 
and this town
is gonna go tits up
in no short order 
once you start stacking
bodies in the streets 
there ll be panic 
public disorder 
looting  rape  murder 
and that s just for starters 
the death toll will
be unimaginable 
and by that time 
there ll be absolutely
fuck all we can do about it 
you have to think
of the millions that
we ll be saving 
are you talking about people 
or pound notes 
chief nelson 
would you join me
in my office 
if this is a bollocking 
make it quick 
i ve got a job to do 
i need to be out there
on the streets 
michael 
what we re about to show you
is highly confidential
and potentially
volatile material 
when the wall went up 
the government at that
time  naturally 
wanted to know
what was happening
on the other side 
so they re tasked one of
their military satellites
to provide coverage
of edinburgh and glasgow 
for the past 30 years 
it s carried on
taking pictures 
sending down what you d
expect  empty cities 
deserted streets 
that is 
until three years ago 
when these turned up 
hatcher  people 
on the streets of glasgow 
survivors 
what else could it be 
and if there are survivors 
there must surely be a cure 
what we have to do
is get our hands on it 
we already have
a team standing by 
all we need is somebody
to lead them 
someone to take them in 
find the cure
and deliver it into our hands
before it s too late
to turn the tide 
you don t know how many
survivors there are 
and the team might not find
them in time  they might
not find them at all 
and they could
still be contagious 
that s what the team s
going to find out 
you ve known for
three fucking years
that they were up there 
but you swept it
under the carpet 
scotland s dead
have long since
been laid to rest 
yesterday  if i turned up
on the 6 00 news with
a survivor in tow 
they d have strung me up
from the nearest lamp post
by the balls 
but if  in 48 hours 
i arrive with a survivor
and a cure 
sure they won t
give a flying fuck
about the survivor 
but they ll be lining up
to kiss my arse
for that cure 
in politics 
survival is timing 
and ours is running out 
we have 48 hours 
i need your best man
on this  right away 
all right 
i know someone who might
just fit the bill 
get in the car 
it s pissing down 
how long have they known 
long enough 
but that doesn t matter now 
matters to me 
there are survivors
out there 
this is not some
personal quest
i m sending you on 
focus on your mission 
who s behind it  hatcher 
hatcher s got the swagger
and the smiles  but it s
canaris who pulls the strings 
he s the power
behind the throne 
and he s not someone
you want to pick
a fight with 
who  me 
i m serious 
if the truth got out 
it would bring hatcher 
the government 
the whole fucking
system down 
and there s no way
canaris is ever gonna
let that happen 
once you re over that wall 
there s no rules 
no backup 
better that way 
look after this for me 
would you 
don t suppose
you got a cigarette 
there s no smoking
on the helicopter 
and i don t smoke 
fair enough 
dr  marcus kane 
he was leading
the research into the virus
when the gates were closed 
he was trapped
inside the hot zone 
his lab was located inside
the quarantine compound
in glasgow 
if anybody was capable
of developing a cure 
it was him 
i suggest you start
at the lab  pick up
the trail from there 
you ll rendezvous with
the rest of the team
at the wall 
then you ll proceed north
in two armored transports 
scotland is still why not fly in 
a no fly zone 
hatcher needs to keep this
as low profile as possible 
so if we don t make it out 
no one will know we went in 
you ve got 46 hours 
if you don t make it back 
the city of london
and everybody in it
will be left to die 
if it s there 
i ll find it 
you ll need this  it s a gps
locator beacon  it ll tell us
exactly where you are 
we ll have a gun ship
standing by to extract
your team 
so much for low profile 
once you have the cure 
it won t matter 
what happens if i don t
find anything up there 
then you needn t
bother coming back 
man on pa 
for your own safety 
return to your homes 
east london
is under martial law 
 car horns honking 
 people clamoring 
what the hell are we
going to do  canaris 
just calm down
and listen 
even if 
by some miracle 
sinclair finds
what she s looking for
and makes it back in time 
the fact remains 
this is our fault 
we made it happen 
too many people crammed
into ghettos so tight
they can barely move 
we created the perfect
breeding ground
for a virus to take place 
and the more we save now 
the more chance there is
of the same thing
happening all over again 
now  we have an opportunity
to buy ourselves
breathing room 
what exactly are
you suggesting 
we re at war  prime minister 
it s basic combat triage 
leave the dying to die 
with the whole
world watching 
with a lie this big 
we can get away with
anything we want 
major sinclair 
good flight 
fine 
sergeant norton 
welcome to no man s land 
why call it that 
there s not another living
soul for miles south of
that wall  except us 
what about
the sentries 
no  the whole system
was fully automated
about 20 years ago 
nowadays they only
expend their ammo
on the local wildlife 
a team arrived two hours
ago  they re prepping
their gear inside 
ask them to get suited up 
sergeant  we re against
the clock on this one 
yes  sir

major sinclair 
chandler  armor division

yeah  they may be ugly 
but they move like
shit off a shovel 
twin v12 engines 
two inch armor plate 
and they ll take anything
from 30mm rounds to
chemical weapons 
just the ticket for
a night on the town 
where d they
find these things 
read  they patrolled
the hot zone  just
north of the wall 
when the system was
automated  most of them
were sold off for scrap 
these are the last
two in service 
major  meet corporal read

stirling joined me in  31 
until hatcher 
in his infinite wisdom 
decided to pull the plug
on the whole program
three years ago 
tried everything  of course 
just couldn t crack it 
i do hope this trip of yours
is worth the risk  major 
apparently  someone
thinks so

get back inside 
you know that dr  kane
was the best man
in his field 
his papers on virus research
were required reading when
i was in medical school 
basically  he taught me
everything i know
but i never actually
met the man 
this file s been
closed for 25 years 
the government tried
to suppress any information
getting out of the hot zone 
didn t want people to
know how bad things
had got up there 
kane on recording 
i don t think we can
stay here much longer 
morality has abandoned
these people  the killing   
seems he dug in
with a bunch of
stranded soldiers 
fortified the hospital
as best they could 
kept up regular reports
on the army frequency
using their coms set
till the power
went out permanently 
kane  the fires have spread 
the power supply is dwindling 
and our food and water
are running out fast 
at night we can hear
the distant cries
of pain and anguish 
they ve begun
to feed off each other 
it s medieval out there 
ammunition is low 
the barricades won t
hold out much longer 
our time has run out 
this is dr  marcus kane
signing off 
what do the
numbers mean 
sinclair  it s the number
of people in each house
that needed saving 
they were told
to stay in their homes 
that help would come 
clear 
stirling 
what do you know
about line of fire 
i m a lab hound 
not a combat surgeon 
that s all we need 
line of fire is the air
between the target
and the weapon
through which the bullet
travels very fast 
it s also the last
place you want to
be in a fire fight 
if anything happens 
you get behind me quick

of everyone  even me 
his people are too afraid
to defy him  and those who

you re living proof
of a world beyond that wall 
all our lives he
told us there was
nothing out there 
you being here

 people cheering 
wayward daughter returns 
 grunts 
you brought some friends 
came over the wall 
we want to see kane 
 whimpering 
kane  i knew they d be
watching the cities 
that s why
we chose this place 
out of sight  out of mind 
i suppose it was only
a matter of time
before they sent someone
to answer to the question 
 why are you alive
when you should be dead  
that s what you want
to know  isn t it 
ow 
answer him 
something along those lines 
leave us 
the answer is easy 
in the land of the infected 
the immune man is king 
so if this is
just a power trip 
why stay hidden 
why not show yourselves 
you think we chose
to cast off the apparel
of our former existence 
no  no  no 
we didn t choose anything 
we were delivered 
these walls around you 
they were built to last 
and so shall we 
what we ve built here
from the ashes is pure blood 
uninfected by
the outside world 
until now 
have you found the cure 
 laughs 
even now you still
cling to hope 
if i were you 
i would abandon
any such thoughts 
there s always hope 
but there is no cure 
there never was 
we had prevailed here 
not because of science 
but through natural selection 
survival of the fittest 
we have earned
the right to live here 
purged of the likes of you 
take them away 
don t you even want
to know why we re here 
 exclaims 
that you re here at all
is sin enough 
it s the reaper virus 
it s back 
and if he touches me one
more time  i will kill him
where he stands  i swear

here to ask for my help
