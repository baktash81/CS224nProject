what they call sentence interpretation 
do you understand that 
you know what those   
what interpreting a sentence means 
no 
it s just a fancy word
for telling what the words mean to you 
  okay 
  okay 
and what these are 
these are common expressions that people
sometimes say 
you might hear it out on the street 
you might ve seen it on tv 
uh  maybe a friend 
maybe your grandmother 
so  i m going to read you
a few of those  okay 
  okay 
  all right 
uh  the first one is 
 don t count your chickens
before they hatch  
what does that mean to you 
that expression 
 don t count your chickens
before they hatch  
don t count your chickens 
okay 
what are you writing down 
well  the reason i m asking you
the questions is
because i m supposed to write   
you know  write down the answers   
yeah  but that s what i m saying 
why are you writing that down 
so  in case i forget it later 
but i don t like people talking about me
after i go places 
i don t blame you  i m not   
and i m not talking about you 
this is just for me 
these are my own notes 
no one sees them but me 
i don t like it  but   
uh  here s another one 
 it s the squeaky wheel
that gets the grease  
what does that expression mean to you 
you ever heard that before 
nick 
okay  nick  you know what 
why don t we skip this section
and just move on to the next one 
it s actually more fun  it s easier 
it s called word comparisons 
it s two words that
don t appear to be connected 
and then you say what
you think when you hear
the two words together  okay 
okay 
all right  first one is 
cat and mouse 
what does that make you think 
they don t like each other 
that s right  they re kind of
enemies against each other  right 
that s what i said 
okay  um   
how about scissors and a cooking pan 
you can hurt yourself with both 
okay 
how about salt and water 
the beach 
the beach 
that s a good answer 
um   
do you mind  could we go back
to the scissors and the cooking pan 
um   
when you said you can hurt yourself 
what were you    what did you mean 
do you ever think about hurting yourself 
why did you think of being hurt 
because i touched the pan 
and i hurt my hand 
oh  well  that makes perfect sense 
what happened 
do you remember when it was 
do you not want to talk about this 
i was sitting there and trying to eat 
and she started yelling at me 
and pushing me 
and just telling me i can t eat food 
that was your grandmother
who was saying that 
yeah  and then she threw stuff at me 
  she threw things at you 
  yeah 
then i picked up the pan 
and i threw it at her 
you threw it at your grandmother 
i threw it at the wall 
oh  you weren t trying
to hit your grandmother 
did you burn yourself
when you threw the pan 
nick

or the precinct first 
i don t know if they got my fingerprints 
i don t know what the fuck is going on 
and i don t remember half of it
 cause i was so goddamned fucked up 
i remember being dropped off by a bus 
the jail releases me  the bus drops me off
right in front
of a liquor store on the corner 
i mean  after doing two years in jail 
what the fuck do you think
is gonna happen  man 
i m gonna want a fucking drink 
right away i m getting a bottle of brandy 
and i m already practically broke 
with the little money
that was left in my account 
so i call my boy  caliph 
ray  what up 
he comes through with some more liquor 
your boy s home  man 
and some sticks of xanax 
my brother 
he takes some sticks 
i take some sticks 
and by now  we re all fucked up 
and i m just feeling so good
that i don t even give a fuck 
so we both walk over
to his boy trevor s house 
this guy who has this hustle going
where he moves acid
for this guy in the bronx
to this other guy in long island 
but what they do is 
they skim a couple of sheets off the top 
you know  so they could have some money
on the side for themselves
before they make the delivery 
yo  bells  belvis 
how much was that 
yo  son  hook me up  son 
finish her  you re a
three minute man anyway 
fuck  let me do my thing  man 
so i ride with him to long island 
and i m thinking the whole time
this po s gonna read me the riot act 
 cause i m fucking up already 
but  i mean   
i m feeling so great  and i m fucked up 
and i just don t give a fuck 
i m celebrating 
i m not gonna spill it 
yo  how much is this shit worth 
so i m at the arcade with trevor now 
you know  we re doing
our thing  hustling acid 
and  you know  we take over this place 
like it s our fucking office 
once in a while someone will show up
and we ll make a sale  you know 
make a sale here  make a sale there 
twenty  you know   
take that shit
and get high  baby boy 
a little stronger than last time  i hope 
but then  one of trevor s friends 
this clown donnie  walks in 
and he s all fucked up 
and he s talking about
how he just robbed some
radio shack down the street 
look  check this out 
at this point 
the acid s kicking in for me 
so i can t follow this shit 
i m having a hard time
following the story 
and i m starting
to freak out a little bit 
bam  right over his fucking head 
and then  guess what happens 
the fucking cops show up 
and the next thing i know 
trevor s grabbing me  and we just book it
into the parking lot 
and i just remember thinking i could run
for  like  20 miles straight 
it s here  right here 
so i m following trevor 
and it s fucking freezing 
he leads us into adventureland 
this amusement park 
at this point  i have no idea
what the fuck is going on 
and then donnie leads us into this ride 
and they look for a place to hide their
shit  but it s fuckin  dark in there 
i can t see shit 
all of a sudden  they get bagged 
i m all by myself in the dark 
and literally
the next thing i remember is 
i m fucking running down
some random street 
and i just see a fucking cab 
and i hail it  and i just get in 
and this driver 
he just kept talking to me
and talking to me  and
i m fucking tripping balls 
 and i m telling him   please  please 
just give me some peace and quiet 
or i m going to throw up  
if you gonna throw up 
you give me my money now
and you get out of this car 
and i told the driver 
 don t worry 
i m going to go in the house  
 i ll get the money from my bag  
i just got out of jail today  man 
i don t have shit 
as soon as he hears the word  jail  
he fuckin  freaks 
talking about   oh  i m not getting ripped
off by one of you punks again  
  i am not getting fucked over 
  and he just fucking
steps on the gas 
and that was it  he just takes off 
i m gonna pay you  my mother s
gonna pay you  she has money 
i m going to the police  okay 
man  i heard the word
 cops   and i lose it 
i gotta get the fuck out of here 
  pull over  fuck this 
  you are crazy 
i m not going back to jail  man 
i m not going back to jail  god damn it 
so i happen to get one of the doors opened
before he locked them all 
this guy s crazy  he s fucking driving 
he s speeding down the road 
30  40 miles an hour 
and i know we re getting
closer and closer to the precinct 
i know where my local
precinct is  it s not far
