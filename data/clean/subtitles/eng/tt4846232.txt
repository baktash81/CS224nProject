what they call sentence interpretation
do you understand that
you know what those
what interpreting a sentence means
no
its just a fancy word
for telling what the words mean to you
okay
okay
and what these are
these are common expressions that people
sometimes say
you might hear it out on the street
you mightve seen it on tv
uh maybe a friend
maybe your grandmother
so im going to read you
a few of those okay
okay
all right
uh the first one is
dont count your chickens
before they hatch
what does that mean to you
that expression
dont count your chickens
before they hatch
dont count your chickens
okay
what are you writing down
well the reason im asking you
the questions is
because im supposed to write
you know write down the answers
yeah but thats what im saying
why are you writing that down
so in case i forget it later
but i dont like people talking about me
after i go places
i dont blame you im not
and im not talking about you
this is just for me
these are my own notes
no one sees them but me
i dont like it but
uh heres another one
its the squeaky wheel
that gets the grease
what does that expression mean to you
you ever heard that before
nick
okay nick you know what
why dont we skip this section
and just move on to the next one
its actually more fun its easier
its called word comparisons
its two words that
dont appear to be connected
and then you say what
you think when you hear
the two words together okay
okay
all right first one is
cat and mouse
what does that make you think
they dont like each other
thats right theyre kind of
enemies against each other right
thats what i said
okay um
how about scissors and a cooking pan
you can hurt yourself with both
okay
how about salt and water
the beach
the beach
thats a good answer
um
do you mind could we go back
to the scissors and the cooking pan
um
when you said you can hurt yourself
what were you what did you mean
do you ever think about hurting yourself
why did you think of being hurt
because i touched the pan
and i hurt my hand

what happened
do you remember when it was
do you not want to talk about this
i was sitting there and trying to eat
and she started yelling at me
and pushing me
and just telling me i cant eat food

to his boy trevors house
this guy who has this hustle going
where he moves acid
for this guy in the bronx

to freak out a little bit
bam right over his fucking head
and then guess what happens
the fucking cops show up
and the next thing i know
trevors grabbing me and we just book it
into the parking lot
and i just remember thinking i could run
for like 20 miles straight
its here right here
so im following trevor
and its fucking freezing
he leads us into adventureland
this amusement park
at this point i have no idea
what the fuck is going on
and then donnie leads us into this ride
and they look for a place to hide their
shit but its fuckin dark in there
i cant see shit
all of a sudden they get bagged
im all by myself in the dark
and literally
the next thing i remember is

some random street
and i just see a fucking cab
and i hail it and i just get in
and this driver
he just kept talking to me
and talking to me and
im fucking tripping balls
and im telling him please please

and you get out of this car
and i told the driver
