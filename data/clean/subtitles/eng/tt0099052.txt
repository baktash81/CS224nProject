  we re in a hurry  mr manley 
leave your personal things  just bring
your equipment  we depart immediately 
miguel higueras  our field assistant 
sorry i m late  i ve been held up in caracas
for a while with a fever 
tell the truth  i m not over it yet 
be sick on your own time  mr manley 
i want close ups of every specimen
and coverage of the surrounding
rain forests and tepuis 
the what 
tepui  it s an indian word for mountain 
a place where species have survived
in isolation for millions of years 
any man eating dinosaurs 
atherton  you re in luck 
we re hitting a brand new one today 
great  anybody ever get lost 
legend says men who climb
to the rain desert never return 
but don t worry  we small game hunters
don t climb  we fly 
he friendly 
i hope so  he s our guide 
stick close 
twenty four hour ant 
they bite 
they kill  mr manley 
in sufficient numbers 
so do some of the frogs 
don t touch any 
great 
this is where we re going 
we land here  then walk down here 
this is a sinkhole 
a place where thousands of years
of streaming water
have torn away the rock 
it s very deep  2 000 feet 
and dark at the bottom 
we ll need flash equipment 
stegolepis 
edible and nutritious enough
to survive on for weeks 
thanks  i ll pass 
plants your specialty 
insects and spiders
and identifying new ones 
great  just what the world needs 
more bugs 
what s your speciality  manley 
football 
let s forget the fact that
no one mentioned poison ants and frogs 
but a 2 000 foot drop  come on 
this is for the equipment 
our guide will show us another way down 
what s with him 
this is as far as he ll go 
what 
it s amazing 
the air temp s dropped 10 degrees
in the last 100 meters 
not far 
down there 
  you all right 
  yeah 
i m fine  i just   
what d he say 
he says you should be careful 
you re too big for us to carry out 
wait up 
what does that thing do  anyway 
did you ever throw a large firecracker
into a pond 
maybe when i was a kid  why 
what happened 
all sorts of stuff floated to the surface 
exactly 
everybody ready 
prepare yourselves  gentlemen 
for what 
for pictures  manley  pictures 
what is it 
i think it s a new species of butterfly 
we could call it    photius manlii 
extraordinary 
look at these markings 
don t just sit there 
are you sure it s dead 
yes  quite dead 
two more 
this is highly unusual 
so many spiders this size
in such a confined area 
look at the shape of the abdomen 
we must try to find a live specimen 
  what do you think you re doing 
  it was alive 
don t be ridiculous 
it s just a spider  what s the big deal 
it isn t just a spider 
it was potentially a new species of spider 
isolated and unchanged
for millions of years 
and all you could do is squash it 
that s impossible  they should be dead 
very aggressive 
we ll take two back alive and preserve two 
are you sure that ll do it 
this stuff will kill an elephant 
millions of years  then we come along 
how long s it gonna take us
to get back to camp 
what s the matter 
you still worried about dinosaurs 
this place just gives me the creeps 
incredible 
what is 
these spiders have
no reproductive organs 
almost like worker bees or soldier ants 
yeah  well  if these are the soldiers 
i d hate to see the general 
how are you feeling 
like hell  this fever s killing me 
you don t look so good  take a rest 
the fever 
make sure we ve got
all his film  higueras 
have we notified his family 
i contacted the american consulate 
okay  seal him up 
i really wish you wouldn t
complain about my driving 
ready 
you re pushing it  that s all i got to say 
take it easy  wait 
can you give me a hand here 
i think i ll go move the hearse 
dick  i m sorry to pester you
in this already difficult time 
i know that we already decided
on an open casket 
but we should maybe reconsider 
because i m not sure
how they work down in south america 
but let me say that their
preservation methods differ from ours 
no  you d be welcome
to come down and decide 
but in this already difficult time 
i m not sure i could do that 
no  you do have the option of   
we could put a photograph
on top of the casket 
no  the one that you had
in the newspaper 
okay  kids  go stake out your rooms 
ross  smell that air 
let s just   
before we discover what valuables
broke in the move 
and that the breakfront doesn t fit 
let s just chant twice 
 we did the right thing  
  for the kids 
  for us  for all of us 
  goodbye crime  goodbye grime 
  right 
goodbye culture  goodbye friends 
dad  there s a dead bird over here 
don t touch it 
just go on into the house
and find your sister 
ross  the entire town is yours 
you re the doctor 
can there be a more respected figure 
respect is fine  but actually
i ve always wanted to be feared 
easy with that 
you don t want to agitate the sediments 
château margaux   127 a bottle 
tasty  huh 
at that price  who can afford to drink it 
goes in the basement 
i mean the cellar 
the wine cellar 
i gotta get a big padlock 
protect my investment 
dad 
  what s wrong 
  behind one of the boxes  a spider 
it came at me  it was ugly 
  bigger than this 
  okay  calm down 
you re in the country now  okay 
come on  let s go find that spider 
and let s find your mom
to take care of that spider 
honey  we re in the living room 
we need you to kill a spider 
all right  where is it 
over there  on the box 
killing a spider  cool 
it s bad luck to kill a spider
in a new house 
you just made that up  didn t you  dear 
okay  everything s okay 
poor thing 
it s more scared of us than we are of it 
let s give it a home in the barn 
good idea  shell 
mom  how come you re not
afraid of bugs like dad is 
i m not afraid of all bugs  just   
  be careful of rusty nails 
  chill out 
how about right here 
you sure you won t miss
being in the thick of things 
with all those stars and those crickets
singing  we are in the thick of things 
i mean work  strokes from the boss 
christmas bonuses  office politics 
caffeine  adrenaline 
steady income   
we ll be fine 
between my severance and all your
potential patients  we ll be fine 
when are you meeting with dr metcalf 
thursday morning 
the old coot passes me the torch
at 10 00 sharp 
wait 
we can unpack in the morning 
i have some napoleon brandy
in the basement 
sorry  cellar 
ross  i m exhausted 
it s bad luck not to make love
the first night in a new house 
you just made that up  didn t you  dear 
i have terrific news  at least 
i think  for my patients it s terrific 
though my wife is less than thrilled 
what s that  dr metcalf 
i ve decided to postpone retirement 
i don t know for how long  but   
but 
but when i thought really hard about it 
i realised 
there s only one thing left
to do when you retire 
and i ve seen too many friends
do that very thing
just six months  a year
after they gave up their professions 
but you   
when we spoke just four months ago 
you assured me that   
i m not ready to retire  doctor 
and if my wife can t rush me into it 
you sure as hell can t either 
excuse me 
you gotta feed the meter  partner 
yeah  well  i was just leaving 
a little late  though 
i do have medical plates 
oh  right  you re that new doctor 
  ross jennings 
  sheriff lloyd parsons 
you re a yale grad  i heard 
that s right 
well  it s just a school  isn t it 
that s enough  lloyd parsons 
a young doctor comes to canaima
and you write him a parking ticket 
  what are you doing  ms hollins 
  what the whole town ought to do 
your ticker tape parade 
  thank you 
  that s littering 
lloyd s been a bully since the 5th grade 
i ought to know  i held him back 
walk me to my automobile 
thank you for the swift intervention 
  how did you know who i was 
  we re neighbours 
i gave you a standing ovation
when you arrived 
between you and me  sam metcalf
only recently gave up leeches 
he also recently gave up retirement 
we moved from san francisco
with the understanding
that i would inherit all of his patients 
but now i have none 
no  dr jennings  you have one 
honey  look at this light 
on the best day in the city 
we didn t get light like this 
maybe they ll give me a show in town 
don t they do that in little towns 
in the town hall 
 molly jennings  a retrospective  
of course  i ll need to
take some pictures first 
there s good news and there s bad news 
should we go in reverse alphabetical
order and start with the good 
i m seeing my first patient this afternoon 
she s a great old dame 
she lives just up the road 
terrific  what s the bad news 
she s my only patient 
today 
metcalf changed his mind 
  what 
  yeah 
he panicked  is what it is 
he decided that if he retires
he will lose his zest for life
and die within 48 hours or something 
but he told you 
we looked in 14 towns 
we bought a house 
you rented an office 
what are we going to do 
kill him 
i have my fax machine 
i can work part time from here 
a phone and a fax  that s all i need 
i ll call my old clients 
  even with half my commissions   
  we re gonna be fine 
  just like you said 
  with one patient 
maybe i ll get lucky and all of her systems
will be ravaged by disease 
kind of like having seven patients in one 
fit as a fiddle 
not a damn thing wrong with you 
dr jennings  i m sorry 
what do you mean  do you think i was
hoping you were ravaged by disease 
what about my high blood pressure 
you have above normal systolic pressure 
which is less dangerous
than a diastolic elevation 
and yours is well below a level
that requires treatment 
do i need these 
no 
see  there s a difference between
the two types of hypertension 
and in my opinion   
in my opinion  dr metcalf doesn t know
his ass from a hole in the ground 
but canaima folks 
they re comfortable with him 
they weren t always  though 
when he first hit town just after the war 
everyone was terribly standoffish 
  how d he overcome that 
  he threw a party  invited the whole town 
if sam metcalf were half as good
at medicine
as he is at public relations 
he could run for the next surgeon general 
that s it  next month 
when the afternoons are cooler
we ll throw you a party 
thanks 
so  your one patient 
is she a walking health hazard 
i couldn t even find a wart on her 
great  so what do we do 
enjoy the fact that since we
no longer live in san francisco 
we no longer have to refer to this as pasta 
  skinny spaghetti 
  daddy s not done 
on the bright side 
margaret  my tragically healthy patient 
has offered to throw us
a  get to know dr jennings  party 
daddy s not done 
one cup of punch
with the handsome new gp
and the good people of canaima will see
the light and abandon old doc metcalf 
  it s a nice gesture 
  yeah 
can we go play with bunny 
yeah  i want you both in
before dark  though 
bunny beechwood 
she popped over this morning 
a neighbour  seems nice 
what do you bet they re gonna
go chase fireflies or something 
  wanna blow up a bullfrog 
  okay 
i got some great shots in the barn today 
if the camera picks up the web
with half the detail my eyes do   
the web 
yeah  our little spider
made himself a hell of a home 
i think even you would appreciate it 
molly    how can i make this more clear 
  i have   
  a terrible fear of spiders 
i m aware  i ve seen what happens 
which is why i think you should force
yourself to come and look at the web 
look at the web 
yes  and see it for the extraordinary
and beautiful thing it is 
therapy  ross 
we live in the country now 
it s time to work through
this irrational  paralysing terror 
  it s not irrational 
  i know 
the incident 
it s like it happened yesterday 
nobody remembers anything
from when they were two 
it s my first memory 
i can envision the crib 
all around me  clear as day 
i can still feel the feeling of waking up 
just drowsy  peaceful  secure 
then there it was 
  probably just a daddy longlegs 
  it seemed huge 
it just came relentlessly 
crawling through the bars of the crib 
  as it touched my bare leg   
  i know  you were just wearing a diaper 
all my limbs involuntarily froze 
you were probably still half asleep 
i was paralysed  molly 
i still get paralysed 
try to understand how this makes me feel 
i was physically unable to stop it
from crawling along my naked skin 
i can still
feel its hairy little legs just   
then up to my face 
it s the feeling
of utter helplessness 
being explored by an alien thing 
that s all 
can you blame me
for being a spider phobe 
arachnophobe 
whatever 
you see it up there 
right beyond the ladder 
impressive  huh 
therapy  right 
right 
oh  god 
there  you see 
you still have full use of all your limbs 
have you seen it up here 
i think you spared the eight legged
frank lloyd wright 
are you okay  honey  it s okay 
what the hell was that 
it s   
come on 
jesus 
hold me 
oh  my god 
  the summer wind came blowing in
  from across the sea
how are you finding life here 
after a few initial shocks 
we re slowly adjusting  i think 
i ve been checking on you  ross 
henry  when i m finally ready
to throw in the towel 
dr jennings is your man 
  henry beechwood 
  ross jennings 
  by all accounts  a fine physician 
  i ll remember that 
this brings back memories 
right after the war 
when i moved to canaima 
the whole town threw me a party 
you threw yourself a party 
now that was a party 
now that is a jerk 
  canaima welcomes you 
  thank you 
listen  i was interested in something 
i wonder if you could give me a little help 
do you think
that i should have this removed 
what s bunny showing them over there 
hand to hand combat techniques 
so becky  have you thought about
what you ll major in at college 
gym 
it s in the genes 
bobby here 
he s the broncos  star quarterback 
i taught him to throw a football
before he could walk 
i coach the team 
nepotism  huh 
actually  we re baptists 
nobody comes up to a mortician
at a party and says 
 irv  you think i might be dead  
must drive you nuts
trying to dip your dorito
while somebody s showing you his growth 
how do you handle it 
i just mention that until quite recently
my wife was a successful stockbroker 
say  what do you think about that   
  why shouldn t i have another 
  because you ve had too much already 
  let s go 
  no  i m thirsty 
that s the manleys 
their son recently passed away 
that s awful  how 
i m not sure  he was a scientist 
photographer 
he was on a scientific expedition down in   
venezuela 
nobody d tell me how 
  or even let me see him to say goodbye 
  let s go 
i had to recommend a closed coffin 
his body looked all chewed up 
drained 
like some vampire had had a go at him 
it was terrible 
excuse us 
i ll be you made enough friends today
to break sam metcalf s death grip 
it was wonderful 
we can t thank you enough 
nor i you 
freeing me from those damn pills 
i feel i could compete in a triathlon 
on the basis of your check up 
i tend to agree 
  bye bye  margaret 
  bye  molly 
irv  claire  would you like a doggy bag 
we re fine  thank you 
great party  margaret 
come on  honey  party s over 
happy hunting  felix 
see you in the morning 
you d have had too much punch
and been the life of the party 
i missed you 
ross 
i could have killed one of you 
the nails came straight   
it s all rotten down there 
my wine cellar is   
it s probably crawling with termites 
i m surprised
we haven t fallen through the floor 
i ll call the exterminator 
you re rather casual
about the death of my dream 
i ve been trying to reach margaret
to thank her
and her line s been busy all morning 
she s probably gabbing 
  you want me to   
  would you 
i ll go over and check on her 
margaret 
so what do you think  doc 
heart attack 
bound to happen  rather sooner than later 
she had a history of high blood pressure 
  even with the pills i put her on   
  i took her off those 
what right did you have to do that 
she came to me  as a patient 
you didn t notice she was hypertensive 
her diastolic reading was normal 
her systolic elevation was below 160 
  if you d stayed current   
  this is a very serious matter  young man 
  you may well have killed this woman 
  i don t think so  she was in fine shape 
  i want an autopsy 
  never 
look  she was my patient 
and mine for 40 years 
margaret wouldn t want to be butchered 
and nobody here would want that for her 
give it to me  irv 
i m satisfied if you re satisfied  doc 
you come from a big city
where people don t care about each other 
i don t expect you d understand 
a little advice 
if you re ever going to fit in in canaima 
learn to be sensitive to
the feelings of the people here 
i m sorry i m more interested
in medicine than public relations 
you know  cardiac victims
don t usually bite their tongues off 
it s as though she went
into titanic convulsions 
until i know why  this case isn t closed 
you re damn right it s not  i believe
you may be guilty of medical malpractice 
and i intend to pursue the matter
to its conclusion 
ross  i understand she was your patient 
your only patient 
why don t you come by the gym
tomorrow at 3 00 
it s a mile up the road from you 
i ll throw some business your way 
thank you  henry 
i appreciate that 
that was nice of him 
think he could have said it a little louder 
a little young  isn t it 
the wine 
no  margaret  to die at 68 
that s ten years below the life expectancy
of a caucasian female  did you know that 
ross  you re a fine doctor 
i m sure you knew exactly what you were
doing when you took her off those pills 
like i knew what i was doing
when i chose this town 
with the country doctor from hell 
or this fine house 
which is rotting from the ground up 
i m gonna take care of that in the morning 
well  margaret s still
gonna be dead in the morning 
i still want to know what killed her 
he was nailing something in the cellar
and the wood just disintegrated 
termites  huh 
that s what my husband thought 
  and he s an expert in these matters 
  well    no 
didn t think so 
i m glad you called me 
no room for amateurs in this game 
thank you 
what is it 
it s hard to say 
would anybody object
if i tore this floor out 
  i would 
  false alarm  then  lead on 
how bad is it 
i didn t find a thing  go figure 
then why is all the wood rotting 
i ll tell you why 
bad wood 
so    what do we do 
tear out bad wood 
put in good wood 
my husband thought
this would make a good wine cellar 
i collect beer cans myself 
i got a rare  74 of miller lite
with a misprint on the label 
only a hundred or so cans in circulation 
the husband just might want to
take a gander 
no hard shoes on the court 
sorry 
look  i know what a blow
losing margaret was for you 
people keep score 
you re only as good as your last game 
  hell  i ought to know 
  i appreciate your concern  henry 
i want you to enjoy canaima 
clean water  fresh air 
got no police sirens wailing all night 
just crickets 
we have crickets up the wazoo 
actually  i haven t heard any crickets
lately  now that you mention it 
actually  i haven t either 
okay  broncos  the doc s here 
get ready to drop  em 
the doc wants to hear you cough 
you call yourself broncos 
you look like a bunch of babies 
come on 
you re moving in slow motion here 
that s supposed to be a banana out 
looks like a banana split 
  shitty pass 
  i heard that 
what are you  a garbage mouth 
hit the showers 
wash that mouth out  miller 
  you know the patterns 
  like the back of my hand 
get in here  run the same thing again 
hurry up 
come on  miller 
we re waiting on you  let s go 
come on  move it  you wanna play 
come on  run  let s go 
thanks 
run it 
up  let s go 
miller  you all right 
  coach 
  what s wrong with miller 
back up  let him breathe 
what s wrong  what is it 
come on  give us some air 
let s get his helmet off 
real easy  support his head  coach 
real gentle 
from what i hear 
it wasn t a very hard tackle 
i only wish i knew  you see
dr jennings examined him last 
why so gloomy 
bunny beechwood says that
everybody s calling you dr death 
that s just silly  shelley 
and they say you want to
cut people up into little pieces 
tom  look   
it s called an autopsy 
it s not a very pleasant thing 
but sometimes it s the only way to find out
what really happened to a person 
but some doctors who should know better
won t accept that 
but some doctors who should know better
just won t accept
that their big city methods
don t sit well in a small town 
both margaret and that poor boy
did seem to be quite healthy 
it s a bit odd  don t you think  sam 
if i autopsied everyone
who ever died of a heart attack
i d be run out of canaima so fast   
poor sam  you still think life is
a popularity contest 
you re not jealous of
our new young doctor  are you 
what 
now you made me lose my timing 
you re yelling  sam 
come on to bed 
i need a shower 
i d love to start taking walks
around the neighbourhood with you 
it s not the same thing  evelyn 
i need to know exactly how far i ve gone
and exactly how long it took me 
floor s cold  sam 
you re right  you re always right 
damn 
  what s wrong 
  some damn thing bit me 
it s just a spider 
spider  felt like a damn cougar 
damn 
i m having a seizure 
sam  what should i do 
ambulance  call jennings 
i ll be right there 
  what s going on 
  metcalf  he s having a seizure 
thank god you didn t
examine him this morning 
  what s the coroner doing here 
  i don t know 
milt  this isn t necessary 
i ll be the judge of that  lloyd 
wait out here 
guard the house or something 
was he alive when you got here 
he d been dead maybe five minutes 
whatever it was  it was abrupt and acute 
what s your guess  massive coronary 
cerebral haemorrhage 
his wife says he was bitten by a spider
just before he seized 
oh  right 
sam told me about you 
you re the hot shot who won t accept
anyone else s diagnosis 
i ll accept it if i agree with it 
good 
let me show you something 
down here 
i believe that s a spider bite 
i ll buy that 
but i rather doubt that s what killed him
in twenty years 
i ve seen only one spider bite fatality 
and that involved a black widow
and a one year old child 
no  my guess is that
sam overexerted himself 
his wife said he was using the treadmill
just before he keeled over 
you may be right 
i want a full autopsy 
tissue samples  blood toxicology 
the whole nine yards 
  wait just one second 
  shut up  lloyd 
  you ll get evelyn s permission  of course 
  of course 
  you need a ride home 
  no  i m all right  thanks 
you better take care of yourself now 
you re the town doctor 
say  aahh  
okay  i think we re gonna
treat this inflammation with antibiotics 
does this mean
i don t get any ice cream 
i ll buy you a double scoop
on the way home 
who s next 
i ll take that  thank you very much 
step right this way 
just have a seat  i ll be right with you 
okay  hot shot  are you sitting down 
according to preliminary data 
sam metcalf died as the result of
a minute amount of an as yet unidentified
toxic substance in his bloodstream 
my office isn t ruling out accidental
poisoning  deliberate poisoning
or even killer spiders 
at the moment 
it looks like a heart attack to me 
but i ll support
whatever you d like to do 
i gotta have those bodies exhumed 
i gotta be sure 
okay 
whatever you think is necessary 
thanks 
are you out of your mind 
slowly and once more  lloyd  
i want margaret hollins 
and todd miller s bodies exhumed 
dug up 
you start pulling citizens out of the ground
that should be enjoying eternal rest
and that roomful of patients
will disappear   
i ll just get a court order 
milt briggs is on my side 
this is a very bad business 
mr yale graduate big city doctor 
a very bad business 
no shit 
  hi  dad 
  hi  honey 
what s going on 
i promised shelley
she could spend the night with bunny 
we ll take good care of her 
wait 
there may be some spiders around here
that are very dangerous 
okay  i just want you girls
to be aware of this 
if you should see one 
don t try to capture it or kill it 
just run  you understand 
  run 
  we ll do that  dr jennings 
you don t have to worry about anything 
dr death 
are you all right 
no 
all clear 
the spider didn t answer 
she had fallen asleep 
it had been a very  very busy day 
okay  your turn  bunny 
the itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the water spout
down came the rain
and washed the spider out
out came the sun
and dried up all the rain
and the itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the spout again
it s my turn now 
little miss muffet sat on a tuffet
eating her curds and whey
and along came a spider
that sat down beside her
and frightened miss muffet   
if you girls don t settle down
then shelley can t stay over any more 
  we can t sleep 
  we keep scaring each other 
why don t you two
go sleep in my room for a while 
okay  nah  we don t need this 
son of a bitch 
where are all the other crickets 
where are all your buddies 
atherton 
yes  dr atherton 
i m ross jennings 
i m a general practitioner  and i   
i have a problem
that may be spider related 
you seem to be the foremost authority
on the west coast 
or any coast  for that matter 
dr jennings  let me tell you that
every so often in a little town somewhere
there is a health scare 
some unexplained outbreak 
and spiders make convenient culprits 
did you know that on every suburban acre
there are at least 50 to 60 000 spiders 
and that each spider eats
about 100 insects per year 
that means at least 5 million insects
are consumed per acre annually 
think about it  doctor 
perhaps man might find the planet
uninhabitable without spiders 
dr atherton 
i have nothing against spiders 
it s just we have had three deaths
in my town
and i m afraid
there s going to be some more 
if you could lend me your expertise 
forjust an afternoon   
we re really not that far from you 
it s a town called canaima 
you know it 
it s familiar 
let me see what i can do 
where are you exactly 
collins 
  sorry 
  are you equally busy tomorrow 
dr atherton 
no  i m chris collins  one of his assistants 
hi  i m chris 
atherton s really busy lately 
he s recently discovered a new species
of spider  down in south america 
to us  it s a big deal 
i hope you ll be able to help us 
we re going to be examining some bodies 
it sounds like a blast 
we re looking for bites 
like this  that s a spider  isn t it 
i m not sure 
i think so 
but even at several times
the potency of latrodectus 
  black widow  right 
  right 
even then it would take
more than one bite to kill 
so i figure this guy s death and the spider
bite  if it a spider bite  are coincidental 
hey  guys  how s it going 
poor margaret 
she was a good wife  good teacher 
good neighbour 
excellent cook 
anything you want  just shout 
i want some fresh air 
chris  come here 
still think it s a coincidence 
that s a spider bite 
the tissue surrounding the bite
is macerated 
found one 
a mark behind the left ear 
  atherton 
  dr atherton  chris collins 
i think we ve got a big problem
here in canaima 
they ve got three dead bodies 
the cause of death seems to be a spider
more deadly than any i ve ever seen 
they want the okay
to quarantine the town 
  are you sure 
  this is way out of my league 
i think you d better come up here
right away 
i can be there tomorrow afternoon 
but collins  try and find me a specimen 
did you bring the keys 
great 
perk up  lloyd 
if we find the spider that did this 
you can arrest him 
milt  why don t you cover the living room 
chris  why don t you check out back 
lloyd  take the kitchen 
and i ll just    i ll oversee the   
i ll just coordinate the   
i ll just stay right here 
what is all that crap 
leftovers 
mostly cricket parts  wings  legs 
we haven t heard any crickets in canaima
these past few weeks 
ross  here 
don t move 
  it s dead  shit 
  what could have killed it 
the shock of seeing lloyd 
there are other people in this house 
dad  go away 
use the one down here 
never a moment s peace 
what happened  are you all right 
why don t we just take the dead spider
and get out of here 
you don t get off that easy  it s already
desiccated  it wouldn t be any use to us 
you mean macerated 
no  i mean desiccated 
dried up  drained of all its blood 
macerated is the    chewing that they do 
they re like little vampires 
this trip of atherton s to find
the spider species  where d he go 
south america 
venezuela  why 
is that one of them 
i d say it s a damn fine suspect 
ross  you re going to have
to take a step towards it 
  chris  i m scared to death 
  we all are 
but our brains secrete a neurotransmitter
that enables us to deal with them 
i don t think i have
that particular neurotransmitter 
yes  you do 
you need an asbestos glove 
doomsday weapon in delbert s war
on a creepy crawler 
i coat it with demon ec 
insecticide with environmental conscience 
it s biodegradable  organic 
you ought to see the little beasties twitch
when they get a whiff of this stuff 
now  delbert   
there s a rumour going around that
some kind of spider killed sam metcalf 
maybe margaret  maybe even my bronco 
doubtful  henry 
in a case in florida one of my colleagues
bumped into a nest of black widows 
sustained over a dozen bites and lived 
of course  he probably lost control
of all of his bodily functions 
there s no spider here 
but i will hunt down the alleged arachnid
and spritz him to kingdom come 
yeah  that s right 
i m bad 
dr atherton  ross jennings 
come in 
did you find me another specimen 
yes  i did 
i also paid a call to the town mortician 
several months ago  there was a corpse 
the body was desiccated 
it was totally drained of blood 
irv agreed that
if the spider was big enough
and it spent a long enough time
working on that body   
i think i know
why you ve heard of canaima 
this was jerry manley s home town 
  manley the photographer 
  yeah 
i think one of your venezuelan spiders
hitched a ride here in manley s coffin 
the fangs  the injectors 
are disproportionately large 
three poison sacs 
now  let s test the venom 
the nature of the toxin and the amount
injected determine the effect of the bite 
and  of course  the place
where the subject is bitten 
it can lead to paralysis or death 
i m no expert  but i d guess this toxin
is fatal at a fraction of that dose 
i d agree 
no sex organs 
that would make them drones 
or soldiers 
that s typically seen in highly organised
insect societies bees  ants  
but we ve never seen it in spiders 
  i have 
  venezuela  right 
right  this is the descendant 
somehow that south american male
has mated with a domestic house spider
and created a very deadly strain 
but if it has no sex organs 
it can t reproduce  right 
true  and the accelerated growth rate 
combined with the specialisation 
suggests a short life cycle 
we ve already seen a dead one 
  that could be the good news 
  now let s discuss the bad 
in their own ecosystem 
the species i discovered in south america
live at the top of the food chain 
the spread out from a central nest in a
web like pattern and dominate the area 
but in their original habitat  geography
contains them  that isn t true here 
so the original male s
the grandaddy of them all 
and he s acting like a general
sending his troops to battle 
excuse me 
professor  this is our town exterminator 
mcclintock  infestation management 
always nice to meet a colleague 
he believes he came across one of the
offending spiders a couple of hours ago 
might you have brought it with you 
actually  he s probably still
on the bottom of my shoe 
you really can t tell what it is any more 
in this first generation 
the original male also produced a queen 
together they will construct a primary nest 
which the queen will guard 
but eventually she will create
reproductive offspring of her own 
when that happens  this town is dead 
and the next town  and the next town 
and the next one and so on 
irv owns the mortuary
where it must have originated 
  if we go in and destroy the original male   
  and the primary nest 
  i ll call the department of agriculture 
  there s phones in the office 
  i ll see you later at the mortuary 
  sheriff  you ll give me a ride 
i am not a chauffeur 
  shut up 
  damn  it s busy 
irv and blaire always take the phone off
the hook during wheel of fortune 
let s get the hell over there 
blaire  real butter or fake butter 
fake 
  irv  hurry 
  buttery  hot and delicious 
he needs to buy a vowel 
buy a vowel 
delbert 
what s this nest 
what s it gonna look like 
you d know it if you found it 
the area would be dark  warm  moist 
it d be kind of a musty smell
and you d probably see an egg sac 
like your basic egg sac 
white  cocooned  pulsating 
about the size of a softball 
of course  there d be
no other spiders around 
what do you mean 
spiders are cannibals  so she wouldn t
want any others near her offspring 
yes  tell them exactly what i ve told you 
even if it is interrupting a dinner party 
sheriff 
where is this 
it s the old daniels place 
jennings bought it 
take me there 
hey  irv 
ross 
canaima welcomes you 
irv  we have an emergency 
i ll get us into the mortuary 
ross 
we ve found it 
please go back to the mortuary and round
up my assistant and that exterminator 
all right  i ll do that 
meanwhile  just stay here  sir  because
i m not going to be responsible for   
fine 
the killings have been so arbitrary 
maybe there s more than one nest 
no  there s just that one 
what was it atherton said 
they radiate out from a central nest 
you got a map of this town 
  thinking about buying here 
  just get a map  please 
here 
the kendalls  house 
mark that down on there 
all righty 
and the old guy  the doctor 
metcalf 
  the football kid 
  died behind the high school 
right here  this is fun 
i found one at beechwood s 
  the old lady  what was her name 
  margaret 
  is that all of them 
  yeah  that s it 
this here in the centre 
that s the mortuary  right 
  no  that s a house 
  who the hell lives there 
i do 
the whole time the nest was
in my own goddamn barn 
i doubt that  doc 
your basic spider d find your old barn
a tad breezy this time of year 
in that respect  spiders are
a bit like you and me 
i frankly doubt the nest is in the barn 
i frankly know it is 
i was in the barn  i saw a web 
there s a web in the barn 
a web would indicate
an arachnoid presence 
they got a saying 
i believe it s in the benelux countries   
just drive  delbert 
just drive and get us there  please 
my  you ve been busy 
incredible 
supper s ready 
come and get it 
i gotta get my family out 
destroy whatever s in the barn 
check  better uncork my private stock 
  chris  there may be spiders in the house 
  they re probably    all right  let s go 
give me a minute to look around out here
and then we go in  nice and easy  all right
