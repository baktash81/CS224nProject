miguel higueras our field assistant
sorry im late ive been held up in caracas
for a while with a fever
tell the truth im not over it yet
be sick on your own time mr manley
i want closeups of every specimen
and coverage of the surrounding
rain forests and tepuis
the what
tepui its an indian word for mountain
a place where species have survived
in isolation for millions of years
any maneating dinosaurs
atherton youre in luck
were hitting a brandnew one today
great anybody ever get lost
legend says men who climb
to the rain desert never return
but dont worry we smallgame hunters
dont climb we fly
he friendly
i hope so hes our guide
stick close
twentyfour hour ant
they bite
they kill mr manley
in sufficient numbers
so do some of the frogs
dont touch any
great
this is where were going
we land here then walk down here
this is a sinkhole
a place where thousands of years
of streaming water
have torn away the rock
its very deep 2000 feet
and dark at the bottom
well need flash equipment
stegolepis
edible and nutritious enough
to survive on for weeks
thanks ill pass
plants your specialty
insects and spiders
and identifying new ones
great just what the world needs
more bugs
whats your speciality manley
football
lets forget the fact that
no one mentioned poison ants and frogs
but a 2000foot drop come on
this is for the equipment
our guide will show us another way down
whats with him
this is as far as hell go
what
its amazing
the air temps dropped 10 degrees
in the last 100 meters
not far
down there
you all right
yeah
im fine i just
whatd he say
he says you should be careful
youre too big for us to carry out
wait up
what does that thing do anyway
did you ever throw a large firecracker
into a pond
maybe when i was a kid why
what happened
all sorts of stuff floated to the surface
exactly
everybody ready
prepare yourselves gentlemen
for what
for pictures manley pictures
what is it
i think its a new species of butterfly
we could call it photius manlii
extraordinary
look at these markings
dont just sit there
are you sure its dead
yes quite dead
two more
this is highly unusual
so many spiders this size
in such a confined area
look at the shape of the abdomen
we must try to find a live specimen
what do you think youre doing
it was alive
dont be ridiculous
its just a spider whats the big deal
it isnt just a spider
it was potentially a new species of spider
isolated and unchanged
for millions of years
and all you could do is squash it
thats impossible they should be dead
very aggressive
well take two back alive and preserve two
are you sure thatll do it
this stuff will kill an elephant
millions of years then we come along
how longs it gonna take us
to get back to camp
whats the matter
you still worried about dinosaurs
this place just gives me the creeps
incredible
what is
these spiders have
no reproductive organs
almost like worker bees or soldier ants
yeah well if these are the soldiers
id hate to see the general
how are you feeling
like hell this fevers killing me
you dont look so good take a rest
the fever
make sure weve got
all his film higueras
have we notified his family
i contacted the american consulate
okay seal him up
i really wish you wouldnt
complain about my driving
ready
youre pushing it thats all i got to say
take it easy wait
can you give me a hand here
i think ill go move the hearse
dick im sorry to pester you
in this already difficult time
i know that we already decided
on an open casket
but we should maybe reconsider
because im not sure
how they work down in south america
but let me say that their
preservation methods differ from ours
no youd be welcome
to come down and decide
but in this already difficult time
im not sure i could do that
no you do have the option of
we could put a photograph
on top of the casket
no the one that you had
in the newspaper
okay kids go stake out your rooms
ross smell that air
lets just
before we discover what valuables
broke in the move
and that the breakfront doesnt fit
lets just chant twice
we did the right thing
for the kids
for us for all of us
goodbye crime goodbye grime
right
goodbye culture goodbye friends
dad theres a dead bird over here
dont touch it
just go on into the house
and find your sister
ross the entire town is yours

respect is fine but actually
ive always wanted to be feared
easy with that
you dont want to agitate the sediments
château margaux 127 a bottle
tasty huh
at that price who can afford to drink it
goes in the basement
i mean the cellar
the wine cellar
i gotta get a big padlock

come on lets go find that spider
and lets find your mom
to take care of that spider
honey were in the living room
we need you to kill a spider

over there on the box
killing a spider cool
its bad luck to kill a spider
in a new house
you just made that up didnt you dear
okay everythings okay
poor thing
its more scared of us than we are of it
lets give it a home in the barn
good idea shell
mom how come youre not
afraid of bugs like dad is
im not afraid of all bugs just
be careful of rusty nails
chill out
how about right here
you sure you wont miss
being in the thick of things
with all those stars and those crickets
singing we are in the thick of things
i mean work strokes from the boss
christmas bonuses office politics
caffeine adrenaline
steady income
well be fine
between my severance and all your
potential patients well be fine
when are you meeting with dr metcalf
thursday morning
the old coot passes me the torch
at 1000 sharp
wait
we can unpack in the morning
i have some napoleon brandy
in the basement
sorry cellar
ross im exhausted
its bad luck not to make love
the first night in a new house
you just made that up didnt you dear
i have terrific news at least
i think for my patients its terrific
though my wife is less than thrilled
whats that dr metcalf
ive decided to postpone retirement
i dont know for how long but
but
but when i thought really hard about it
i realised
theres only one thing left
to do when you retire
and ive seen too many friends
do that very thing
just six months a year
after they gave up their professions
but you
when we spoke just four months ago
you assured me that
im not ready to retire doctor
and if my wife cant rush me into it
you sure as hell cant either
excuse me
you gotta feed the meter partner
yeah well i was just leaving
a little late though
i do have medical plates
oh right youre that new doctor
ross jennings
sheriff lloyd parsons
youre a yale grad i heard
thats right
well its just a school isnt it
thats enough lloyd parsons
a young doctor comes to canaima
and you write him a parking ticket
what are you doing ms hollins
what the whole town ought to do
your ticker tape parade
thank you
thats littering
lloyds been a bully since the 5th grade
i ought to know i held him back
walk me to my automobile
thank you for the swift intervention
how did you know who i was
were neighbours
i gave you a standing ovation
when you arrived
between you and me sam metcalf
only recently gave up leeches
he also recently gave up retirement
we moved from san francisco
with the understanding
that i would inherit all of his patients
but now i have none
no dr jennings you have one
honey look at this light
on the best day in the city
we didnt get light like this
maybe theyll give me a show in town
dont they do that in little towns
in the town hall
molly jennings a retrospective
of course ill need to
take some pictures first
theres good news and theres bad news
should we go in reversealphabetical
order and start with the good
im seeing my first patient this afternoon
shes a great old dame
she lives just up the road
terrific whats the bad news
shes my only patient
today
metcalf changed his mind
what
yeah
he panicked is what it is
he decided that if he retires
he will lose his zest for life
and die within 48 hours or something
but he told you
we looked in 14 towns
we bought a house
you rented an office
what are we going to do
kill him
i have my fax machine
i can work parttime from here
a phone and a fax thats all i need
ill call my old clients
even with half my commissions
were gonna be fine
just like you said
with one patient
maybe ill get lucky and all of her systems
will be ravaged by disease
kind of like having seven patients in one
fit as a fiddle
not a damn thing wrong with you
dr jennings im sorry
what do you mean do you think i was
hoping you were ravaged by disease
what about my high blood pressure
you have abovenormal systolic pressure
which is less dangerous
than a diastolic elevation
and yours is well below a level
that requires treatment
do i need these
no
see theres a difference between
the two types of hypertension
and in my opinion
in my opinion dr metcalf doesnt know
his ass from a hole in the ground
but canaima folks
theyre comfortable with him
they werent always though
when he first hit town just after the war
everyone was terribly standoffish
howd he overcome that
he threw a party invited the whole town
if sam metcalf were half as good
at medicine
as he is at public relations
he could run for the next surgeon general
thats it next month
when the afternoons are cooler
well throw you a party
thanks
so your one patient
is she a walking health hazard
i couldnt even find a wart on her
great so what do we do
enjoy the fact that since we
no longer live in san francisco
we no longer have to refer to this as pasta
skinny spaghetti
daddys not done
on the bright side
margaret my tragically healthy patient
has offered to throw us
a get to know dr jennings party
daddys not done
one cup of punch
with the handsome new gp
and the good people of canaima will see
the light and abandon old doc metcalf
its a nice gesture
yeah
can we go play with bunny
yeah i want you both in
before dark though
bunny beechwood
she popped over this morning
a neighbour seems nice
what do you bet theyre gonna
go chase fireflies or something
wanna blow up a bullfrog
okay
i got some great shots in the barn today
if the camera picks up the web
with half the detail my eyes do
the web
yeah our little spider
made himself a hell of a home
i think even you would appreciate it
molly how can i make this more clear
i have
a terrible fear of spiders
im aware ive seen what happens
which is why i think you should force
yourself to come and look at the web
look at the web
yes and see it for the extraordinary
and beautiful thing it is
therapy ross
we live in the country now
its time to work through
this irrational paralysing terror
its not irrational
i know
the incident
its like it happened yesterday
nobody remembers anything
from when they were two
its my first memory
i can envision the crib
all around me clear as day
i can still feel the feeling of waking up
just drowsy peaceful secure
then there it was
probably just a daddy longlegs
it seemed huge
it just came relentlessly
crawling through the bars of the crib
as it touched my bare leg
i know you were just wearing a diaper
all my limbs involuntarily froze
you were probably still halfasleep
i was paralysed molly
i still get paralysed
try to understand how this makes me feel
i was physically unable to stop it
from crawling along my naked skin
i can still
feel its hairy little legs just
then up to my face
its the feeling
of utter helplessness
being explored by an alien thing
thats all
can you blame me
for being a spiderphobe
arachnophobe
whatever
you see it up there
right beyond the ladder
impressive huh
therapy right
right
oh god
there you see
you still have full use of all your limbs
have you seen it up here
i think you spared the eightlegged
frank lloyd wright
are you okay honey its okay
what the hell was that
its
come on
jesus
hold me
oh my god
the summer wind came blowing in
from across the sea
how are you finding life here
after a few initial shocks
were slowly adjusting i think
ive been checking on you ross
henry when im finally ready
to throw in the towel
dr jennings is your man
henry beechwood
ross jennings
by all accounts a fine physician
ill remember that
this brings back memories
right after the war
when i moved to canaima
the whole town threw me a party
you threw yourself a party
now that was a party
now that is a jerk
canaima welcomes you
thank you
listen i was interested in something
i wonder if you could give me a little help
do you think
that i should have this removed
whats bunny showing them over there
handtohand combat techniques
so becky have you thought about
what youll major in at college
gym
its in the genes
bobby here
hes the broncos star quarterback
i taught him to throw a football
before he could walk
i coach the team
nepotism huh
actually were baptists
nobody comes up to a mortician
at a party and says
irv you think i might be dead
must drive you nuts
trying to dip your dorito
while somebodys showing you his growth
how do you handle it
i just mention that until quite recently
my wife was a successful stockbroker
say what do you think about that
why shouldnt i have another
because youve had too much already
lets go
no im thirsty
thats the manleys
their son recently passed away
thats awful how
im not sure he was a scientist
photographer
he was on a scientific expedition down in
venezuela
nobodyd tell me how
or even let me see him to say goodbye
lets go
i had to recommend a closed coffin
his body looked all chewed up
drained
like some vampire had had a go at him
it was terrible
excuse us
ill be you made enough friends today
to break sam metcalfs deathgrip
it was wonderful
we cant thank you enough
nor i you
freeing me from those damn pills
i feel i could compete in a triathlon
on the basis of your checkup
i tend to agree
byebye margaret
bye molly
irv claire would you like a doggy bag
were fine thank you
great party margaret
come on honey partys over
happy hunting felix
see you in the morning
youd have had too much punch
and been the life of the party
i missed you
ross
i could have killed one of you
the nails came straight
its all rotten down there
my wine cellar is
its probably crawling with termites
im surprised
we havent fallen through the floor
ill call the exterminator
youre rather casual
about the death of my dream
ive been trying to reach margaret
to thank her
and her lines been busy all morning
shes probably gabbing
you want me to
would you
ill go over and check on her
margaret
so what do you think doc
heart attack
bound to happen rather sooner than later
she had a history of high blood pressure
even with the pills i put her on
i took her off those
what right did you have to do that
she came to me as a patient
you didnt notice she was hypertensive
her diastolic reading was normal
her systolic elevation was below 160
if youd stayed current
this is a very serious matter young man
you may well have killed this woman
i dont think so she was in fine shape
i want an autopsy
never
look she was my patient
and mine for 40 years
margaret wouldnt want to be butchered
and nobody here would want that for her
give it to me irv
im satisfied if youre satisfied doc
you come from a big city
where people dont care about each other
i dont expect youd understand
a little advice
if youre ever going to fit in in canaima
learn to be sensitive to
the feelings of the people here
im sorry im more interested
in medicine than public relations
you know cardiac victims
dont usually bite their tongues off
its as though she went
into titanic convulsions
until i know why this case isnt closed
youre damn right its not i believe
you may be guilty of medical malpractice
and i intend to pursue the matter
to its conclusion
ross i understand she was your patient
your only patient
why dont you come by the gym
tomorrow at 300
its a mile up the road from you
ill throw some business your way
thank you henry
i appreciate that
that was nice of him
think he could have said it a little louder
a little young isnt it
the wine
no margaret to die at 68
thats ten years below the life expectancy
of a caucasian female did you know that
ross youre a fine doctor
im sure you knew exactly what you were
doing when you took her off those pills
like i knew what i was doing
when i chose this town
with the country doctor from hell
or this fine house
which is rotting from the ground up
im gonna take care of that in the morning
well margarets still
gonna be dead in the morning
i still want to know what killed her
he was nailing something in the cellar
and the wood just disintegrated
termites huh
thats what my husband thought
and hes an expert in these matters
well no
didnt think so
im glad you called me
no room for amateurs in this game
thank you
what is it
its hard to say
would anybody object
if i tore this floor out
i would
false alarm then lead on
how bad is it
i didnt find a thing go figure
then why is all the wood rotting
ill tell you why
bad wood
so what do we do
tear out bad wood
put in good wood
my husband thought
this would make a good wine cellar
i collect beer cans myself
i got a rare 74 of miller lite
with a misprint on the label
only a hundred or so cans in circulation
the husband just might want to
take a gander
no hard shoes on the court
sorry
look i know what a blow
losing margaret was for you
people keep score
youre only as good as your last game
hell i ought to know
i appreciate your concern henry
i want you to enjoy canaima
clean water fresh air
got no police sirens wailing all night
just crickets
we have crickets up the wazoo
actually i havent heard any crickets
lately now that you mention it
actually i havent either
okay broncos the docs here
get ready to drop em
the doc wants to hear you cough
you call yourself broncos
you look like a bunch of babies
come on
youre moving in slow motion here
thats supposed to be a banana out
looks like a banana split
shitty pass
i heard that
what are you a garbage mouth
hit the showers
wash that mouth out miller
you know the patterns
like the back of my hand
get in here run the same thing again
hurry up
come on miller
were waiting on you lets go
come on move it you wanna play
come on run lets go
thanks
run it
up lets go
miller you all right
coach
whats wrong with miller
back up let him breathe
whats wrong what is it
come on give us some air
lets get his helmet off
real easy support his head coach
real gentle
from what i hear
it wasnt a very hard tackle
i only wish i knew you see
dr jennings examined him last
why so gloomy
bunny beechwood says that
everybodys calling you dr death
thats just silly shelley
and they say you want to
cut people up into little pieces
tom look
its called an autopsy
its not a very pleasant thing
but sometimes its the only way to find out
what really happened to a person
but some doctors who should know better
wont accept that
but some doctors who should know better
just wont accept
that their bigcity methods
dont sit well in a small town
both margaret and that poor boy
did seem to be quite healthy
its a bit odd dont you think sam
if i autopsied everyone
who ever died of a heart attack
id be run out of canaima so fast
poor sam you still think life is
a popularity contest
youre not jealous of
our new young doctor are you
what
now you made me lose my timing
youre yelling sam
come on to bed
i need a shower
id love to start taking walks
around the neighbourhood with you
its not the same thing evelyn
i need to know exactly how far ive gone
and exactly how long it took me
floors cold sam
youre right youre always right
damn
whats wrong
some damn thing bit me
its just a spider
spider felt like a damn cougar
damn
im having a seizure
sam what should i do
ambulance call jennings
ill be right there
whats going on
metcalf hes having a seizure
thank god you didnt
examine him this morning
whats the coroner doing here
i dont know
milt this isnt necessary
ill be the judge of that lloyd
wait out here
guard the house or something
was he alive when you got here
hed been dead maybe five minutes
whatever it was it was abrupt and acute
whats your guess massive coronary
cerebral haemorrhage
his wife says he was bitten by a spider
just before he seized
oh right
sam told me about you
youre the hot shot who wont accept
anyone elses diagnosis
ill accept it if i agree with it
good
let me show you something
down here
i believe thats a spider bite
ill buy that
but i rather doubt thats what killed him
in twenty years
ive seen only one spiderbite fatality
and that involved a black widow
and a oneyearold child
no my guess is that
sam overexerted himself
his wife said he was using the treadmill
just before he keeled over
you may be right
i want a full autopsy
tissue samples blood toxicology
the whole nine yards
wait just one second
shut up lloyd
youll get evelyns permission of course
of course
you need a ride home
no im all right thanks
you better take care of yourself now
youre the town doctor
say aahh
okay i think were gonna
treat this inflammation with antibiotics
does this mean
i dont get any ice cream
ill buy you a double scoop
on the way home
whos next
ill take that thank you very much
step right this way
just have a seat ill be right with you
okay hot shot are you sitting down
according to preliminary data
sam metcalf died as the result of
a minute amount of an as yet unidentified
toxic substance in his bloodstream
my office isnt ruling out accidental
poisoning deliberate poisoning
or even killer spiders
at the moment
it looks like a heart attack to me
but ill support
whatever youd like to do
i gotta have those bodies exhumed
i gotta be sure
okay
whatever you think is necessary
thanks
are you out of your mind
slowly and once more lloyd
i want margaret hollins
and todd millers bodies exhumed
dug up
you start pulling citizens out of the ground
that should be enjoying eternal rest
and that roomful of patients
will disappear
ill just get a court order
milt briggs is on my side
this is a very bad business
mr yalegraduatebigcity doctor
a very bad business
no shit
hi dad
hi honey
whats going on
i promised shelley
she could spend the night with bunny
well take good care of her
wait
there may be some spiders around here
that are very dangerous
okay i just want you girls
to be aware of this
if you should see one
dont try to capture it or kill it
just run you understand
run
well do that dr jennings
you dont have to worry about anything
dr death
are you all right
no
all clear
the spider didnt answer
she had fallen asleep
it had been a very very busy day
okay your turn bunny
the itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the water spout
down came the rain
and washed the spider out
out came the sun
and dried up all the rain
and the itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the spout again
its my turn now
little miss muffet sat on a tuffet
eating her curds and whey
and along came a spider
that sat down beside her
and frightened miss muffet
if you girls dont settle down
then shelley cant stay over any more
we cant sleep
we keep scaring each other
why dont you two
go sleep in my room for a while
okay nah we dont need this
son of a bitch
where are all the other crickets
where are all your buddies
atherton
yes dr atherton
im ross jennings
im a general practitioner and i
i have a problem
that may be spiderrelated
you seem to be the foremost authority
on the west coast
or any coast for that matter
dr jennings let me tell you that
every so often in a little town somewhere
there is a health scare
some unexplained outbreak
and spiders make convenient culprits
did you know that on every suburban acre
there are at least 50 to 60000 spiders
and that each spider eats
about 100 insects per year
that means at least 5 million insects
are consumed per acre annually
think about it doctor
perhaps man might find the planet
uninhabitable without spiders
dr atherton
i have nothing against spiders
its just we have had three deaths
in my town
and im afraid
theres going to be some more
if you could lend me your expertise
forjust an afternoon
were really not that far from you
its a town called canaima
you know it
its familiar
let me see what i can do
where are you exactly
collins
sorry
are you equally busy tomorrow
dr atherton
no im chris collins one of his assistants
hi im chris
athertons really busy lately
hes recently discovered a new species
of spider down in south america
to us its a big deal
i hope youll be able to help us
were going to be examining some bodies
it sounds like a blast
were looking for bites
like this thats a spider isnt it
im not sure
i think so
but even at several times
the potency of latrodectus
black widow right
right
even then it would take
more than one bite to kill
so i figure this guys death and the spider
bite if it a spider bite are coincidental
hey guys hows it going
poor margaret
she was a good wife good teacher
good neighbour
excellent cook
anything you want just shout
i want some fresh air
chris come here
still think its a coincidence
thats a spider bite
the tissue surrounding the bite
is macerated
found one
a mark behind the left ear
atherton
dr atherton chris collins
i think weve got a big problem
here in canaima
theyve got three dead bodies
the cause of death seems to be a spider
more deadly than any ive ever seen
they want the okay
to quarantine the town
are you sure
this is way out of my league
i think youd better come up here
right away
i can be there tomorrow afternoon
but collins try and find me a specimen
did you bring the keys
great
perk up lloyd
if we find the spider that did this
you can arrest him
milt why dont you cover the living room
chris why dont you check out back
lloyd take the kitchen
and ill just ill oversee the
ill just coordinate the
ill just stay right here
what is all that crap
leftovers
mostly cricket parts wings legs
we havent heard any crickets in canaima
these past few weeks
ross here
dont move
its dead shit
what could have killed it
the shock of seeing lloyd
there are other people in this house
dad go away
use the one down here
never a moments peace
what happened are you all right
why dont we just take the dead spider
and get out of here
you dont get off that easy its already
desiccated it wouldnt be any use to us
you mean macerated
no i mean desiccated
dried up drained of all its blood
macerated is the chewing that they do
theyre like little vampires
this trip of athertons to find
the spider species whered he go
south america
venezuela why
is that one of them
id say its a damn fine suspect
ross youre going to have
to take a step towards it
chris im scared to death
we all are
but our brains secrete a neurotransmitter
that enables us to deal with them
i dont think i have
that particular neurotransmitter
yes you do
you need an asbestos glove
doomsday weapon in delberts war
on a creepy crawler
i coat it with demon ec
insecticide with environmental conscience
its biodegradable organic
you ought to see the little beasties twitch
when they get a whiff of this stuff
now delbert
theres a rumour going around that
some kind of spider killed sam metcalf
maybe margaret maybe even my bronco
doubtful henry
in a case in florida one of my colleagues
bumped into a nest of black widows
sustained over a dozen bites and lived
of course he probably lost control
of all of his bodily functions
theres no spider here
but i will hunt down the alleged arachnid
and spritz him to kingdom come
yeah thats right
im bad
dr atherton ross jennings
come in
did you find me another specimen
yes i did
i also paid a call to the town mortician
several months ago there was a corpse
the body was desiccated
it was totally drained of blood
irv agreed that
if the spider was big enough
and it spent a long enough time
working on that body
i think i know
why youve heard of canaima
this was jerry manleys home town
manley the photographer
yeah
i think one of your venezuelan spiders
hitched a ride here in manleys coffin
the fangs the injectors
are disproportionately large
three poison sacs
now lets test the venom
the nature of the toxin and the amount
injected determine the effect of the bite
and of course the place
where the subject is bitten
it can lead to paralysis or death
im no expert but id guess this toxin
is fatal at a fraction of that dose
id agree
no sex organs
that would make them drones
or soldiers
thats typically seen in highly organised
insect societiesbees ants
but weve never seen it in spiders
i have
venezuela right
right this is the descendant
somehow that south american male
has mated with a domestic house spider
and created a very deadly strain
but if it has no sex organs
it cant reproduce right
true and the accelerated growth rate
combined with the specialisation
suggests a short life cycle
weve already seen a dead one
that could be the good news
now lets discuss the bad
in their own ecosystem
the species i discovered in south america
live at the top of the food chain
the spread out from a central nest in a
weblike pattern and dominate the area
but in their original habitat geography
contains them that isnt true here
so the original males
the grandaddy of them all
and hes acting like a general
sending his troops to battle
excuse me
professor this is our town exterminator
mcclintock infestation management
always nice to meet a colleague
he believes he came across one of the
offending spiders a couple of hours ago
might you have brought it with you
actually hes probably still
on the bottom of my shoe
you really cant tell what it is any more
in this first generation
the original male also produced a queen
together they will construct a primary nest
which the queen will guard
but eventually she will create
reproductive offspring of her own
when that happens this town is dead
and the next town and the next town
and the next one and so on
irv owns the mortuary
where it must have originated
if we go in and destroy the original male
and the primary nest
ill call the department of agriculture
theres phones in the office
ill see you later at the mortuary
sheriff youll give me a ride
i am not a chauffeur
shut up
damn its busy
irv and blaire always take the phone off
the hook during wheel of fortune
lets get the hell over there
blaire real butter or fake butter
fake
irv hurry
buttery hot and delicious
he needs to buy a vowel
buy a vowel
delbert
whats this nest
whats it gonna look like
youd know it if you found it
the area would be dark warm moist
itd be kind of a musty smell
and youd probably see an egg sac
like your basic egg sac
white cocooned pulsating
about the size of a softball
of course thered be
no other spiders around
what do you mean
spiders are cannibals so she wouldnt
want any others near her offspring
yes tell them exactly what ive told you
even if it is interrupting a dinner party
sheriff
where is this
its the old daniels place
jennings bought it
take me there
hey irv
ross
canaima welcomes you
irv we have an emergency
ill get us into the mortuary
ross
weve found it
please go back to the mortuary and round
up my assistant and that exterminator
all right ill do that
meanwhile just stay here sir because
im not going to be responsible for
fine
the killings have been so arbitrary
maybe theres more than one nest
no theres just that one
what was it atherton said
they radiate out from a central nest
you got a map of this town
thinking about buying here
just get a map please
here
the kendalls house
mark that down on there
allrighty
and the old guy the doctor
metcalf
the football kid
died behind the high school
right here this is fun
i found one at beechwoods
the old lady what was her name
margaret
is that all of them
yeah thats it
this here in the centre
thats the mortuary right
no thats a house
who the hell lives there
i do
the whole time the nest was
in my own goddamn barn
i doubt that doc
your basic spiderd find your old barn
a tad breezy this time of year
in that respect spiders are
a bit like you and me
i frankly doubt the nest is in the barn
i frankly know it is
i was in the barn i saw a web
theres a web in the barn
a web would indicate
an arachnoid presence
they got a saying
i believe its in the benelux countries
just drive delbert
just drive and get us there please
my youve been busy
incredible
suppers ready
come and get it
i gotta get my family out
destroy whatevers in the barn
