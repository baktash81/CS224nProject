you did fine in the corporate 
i was a bit nervous  this
little guy    hello  sorry 
that s nice  eh  nice background
with the people there   
we are here at the    must i look   
  just look straight at the lens 
we are here at the    mnu head office 
department of alien affairs 
my name is wikus van de merwe 
and behind me you can see
the alien affairs  workers 
and what we do here at
this department is   
we try to engage with the prawn
on behalf of mnu and
on behalf of humans 
to everyone s surprise  the
ship didn t come to a stop
over manhattan or washington or chicago 
but instead it costed to a halt
directly over the city of johannesburg 
the doors didn t open for 3 months  it
just hovered there  nobody could get in 
and they eventually decided 
after much deliberation 
that the best thing to do would
be to physically cut their way in 
we were on the verge of first contact 
the whole world was watching 
expecting  i don t know   
   music from heaven and
bright shining lights 
oh my god 
the creatures were
extremely malnourished 
they were very unhealthy 
they seemed to be aimless 
there was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time 
the entire world was
looking at johannesburg 
so we had to do the right thing 
the government then established
an aid group that started to
ferry the aliens to a temporary
camp set up just beneath the ship 
we didn t have a plan 
there was a million of them 
so  what was a temporary
holding zone soon became fenced 
became militarized  and before
we knew it  it was a slum 
but the truth is  nobody
really knew what this place was 
there s a lot of secrets in district 9 
at first  a lot of
attention was given to   
giving the aliens a proper
status and protection 
they re spending so much
money to keep them here 
when they could be spending
it on other things  but   
   at least they re keeping
them separate from us 
l want to be realistic with everyone 
the aliens will not be able to go home 
the aliens are here to stay 
there were literally
thousands of different theories
as to why the ship seemed inoperable 
and what was speculated was that
the command module had detached
itself from the main ship 
and then somehow
mysteriously became lost 
did it fall by itself or was
it programmed  i don t know 
examination of the old video footage
shows very clearly that a
piece falls from the ship 
we look for it  we look everywhere 
this piece that s falling
caused us bloody problems 
more energy weapon caches found 
the special task force
conducted raids in district 9 
where there s a weapon  there s
crime  tensions rose  and rose 
people became more and more fed up 
and eventually the rioting started 
residents in tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night
in an attempt to remove all
the aliens from their township 
i think they must fix
that ship and they must go 
a virus  a selective virus 
release it near the aliens 
they must just go  i
don t know where  just go 
if they was from another
country we might understand 
but they are not even from this planet 
the government have
enforced a nationwide curfew 
the aliens  prawns 
they take my wife away 
the derogatory term prawn is used for
the alien  and obviously it implies
something that is a bottom feeder 
that scavenges the leftovers 
i mean  you can t say
they don t look like that 
that s what they look like 
right  they look like prawns 
the aliens made off with an undisclosed
amount of cash  one bystander was hurt 
what for an alien might be
seen as something recreational 
setting fire to a
truck  derailing a train 
is for us obviously an
extremely destructive act 
they can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you 
they take whatever you have on
you  your cell phone or anything 
after that they kill you 
and now  after 20 years  public
pressure had forced the government
to shift the aliens out of johannesburg 
they had had enough and they
wanted district 9 to be moved 
and more intensively
policed and controlled 
so  to enforce this mass eviction 
the government turned to mnu 
welcome all and thank you for coming 
please listen very
closely to this briefing 
today we start a very complex
and delicate operation 
this is the largest operation
that mnu has ever undertaken 
and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully 
it is to move 1 8 million prawns
from their present home in district
9 to a safer and better location
200 kilometers outside
of johannesburg city 
we built a nice new facility
where the prawn can go 
he can be comfortable 
he can stay there   
the people of johannesburg and
of south africa are going to live
happily and safely  knowing
that that prawn is very far away 
uio protocol dictates
that we give the aliens
24 hours notice of our right to evict 
today  you will serve these notices
getting the aliens to sign i 27 form 
the legality that mnu is using to
evict the aliens is simply a whitewash 
i m going to appoint a field
officer to take direct command 
wikus van de merwe 
everybody always said that
wikus was not a very smart boy 
but he was a wonderful son 
that was my wikus  just   
feels like life on the big
stage  thank you piet    mr smith 
l had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to wikus 
that didn t affect my
decision to promote him 
it s almost as big as my wedding
day  you know    not as big 
wikus was always making me things 
he said that way they
just mean so much more 
he left this paper mache
bowl on the sofa one day
and i didn t see it and i sat
down  and i    kinda squashed it 
they took all his stuff away
for the investigation  and   
i made them bring it all back 
hey  congratulations 
man   thanks  man 
okay  you re gonna go to p7 
  wikus   how is it going  man 
here s the shake  p9 for you   thanks 
i m not saying what he
did was right  but   
he took the choices
that were given to him 
this is trent  fundiswa  trent   hi 
fundiswa is the guy that
i ve selected to replace me 
if he can make it
today  eh   i ll make it 
i just want everyone
watching this right now
to learn from what has
happened   you would think   
things like this would happen
to somebody else  not to me 
how is it going  man  long time 
mate  have you got my stuff 
hey  boss   how is it
going   i m all right  boss 
good  good  this is fundiswa 
he is training with us today 
i think i was disgusted
with the way he worked 
there was always just a hint
of something not quite kosher
with mr van de merwe 
  nobody saw it coming at all 
none of us had any idea
of what he was doing 
l think it is a great
thing to see that   
it s not the military
guys in charge this time 
not to say that koobus and
his cowboys are not wanted 
you guys are always wanted 
you see now  these are the cowboys 
they shoot first  and then
they answer the questions 
sorry  is this above the
allocated amount of ammunition 
because i see your
pouches are full but   
i think maybe you should
speak to the colonel 
f a g  over here says that
we got too much ammunition 
no  all i m saying 
koobus  is that  you know   
you should find ways of making
you guys more efficient   
listen to me  you fuck 
get him outta my face 
there are rules  we re all
living by rules in this world 
well  l don t think he can
be forgiven for what he did 
cause it s like a betrayal 
  i ve gotta get going  les 
i think we re gonna have to cut this
interview  cause we re gonna go   
12 kilometers from district 9
take your magazines 
people  come on  lets go 
the prawn doesn t really understand
the concept of ownership of property 
so  we have to come there and
say  listen  this is our land 
please  will you go 
it s difficult to put
the vest on by yourself 
thomas  can you help
me   all right  boss 
they told me i was gonna get
the vest inside the casper 
thomas  just look on the
side if there s a vest there 
i m just concerned about my family 
  don t worry about the vest  it ll be fine 
rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries should comply
with all uyo regulations in district 9 
we re coming to you from
the entrance of district 9
as today  multi national
united sets out to relocate
approximately 1 8 million alien
residents from their homes 
human rights groups are
keeping a watchful eye 
as many suspect abuses might occur 
we re seeing heavily armed
private security forces
being deployed into district 9 
backed up by significant air support 
we ll go shack to shack and
get them to sign the form 
first one ex 247 
we re seeing the convoy stop 
the operation is about to begin 
just stay focused 
are you ready 
thomas   yeah   okay 
is that a signal  okay  fellows 
you stay behind us  good luck  boy 
stay low  where is he going  what is it 
it s clear that security is very high 
this is only the beginning
of a total clamp down 
this is mnu agents  open
the door please   open up 
hello  hello  hello   
this is wikus van de merwe from mnu 
we are here to serve
you an eviction notice 
you just put your
scrawl there   fuck off 
all right  thomas  hold it 
we ve got his scrawl there 
because as he hit it 
it counts as a scrawl 
first time we come in  there
will always be a little bit
of tension happening
between us and them 
hey  you can t eat that  man 
the prawn likes to eat the rubber 
to him it s like a marshmallow 
no  no  guard  don t
confront him like that 
did you see that  right
in the roost  stay calm 
this is gonna be a problem cause
now all prawns are coming out 
they wanna see what s
going on  stop it  stop it 
bring my kit  see 
everybody is gathering now 
don t shoot or you re gonna
turn it into a warzone 
what is that  is that a
tear gas   no  it s cat food 
it is cat food  i just distract them 
one of them attacked the
prawn and he s lost his arm 
no it s not my house  i don t live here 
well  that s a pity
because  you know  this   
this is a nice cat food  you know 
but of course  it s not your house 
so  we ll just have to go and give it
to someone else   yes  it s my house 
we need you to sign here 
now you can take that   
all right  stop it 
the creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food 
something about it  like catnip
for cats  only a lot more intense 
hello  mnu  we are here
to serve eviction notices 
what is eviction 
what we have stranded
on earth in this colony 
is basically the workers that are
unable to think for themselves 
they will take commands 
they have no initiative 
they ve lost all the apt of leadership
through whatever cause 
we presume illness 
i m holding steady over
nigerian compound area 
where there s a slum  there s crime 
and district 9 was no exception 
the nigerians had various scams going 
one of them was the cat food scam 
where they sold cat food to the
aliens for exorbitant prices 
you put the money here first  you
don t get anything until you pay 
what are you trying to do 
i ll chop your balls off 
not to mention
interspecies prostitution 
and they also dealt in alien weaponry 
you have a car hijacking 
there s a chop shop there 
you can see that  that s
somebody s car in there 
the nigerians in district 9 are
headed by a man called obesandjo 
he s a very powerful underground
figure in johannesburg 
you don t want to play with these boys 
they will cut you into pieces 
that s the boss there  ok  no problem 
don t look at him  this
is gonna cause problems 
all right  next  766  all right 
mnu agents  open the door please 
whoa  jesus  what is it 
check the other side 
control  this is wikus van de merwe 
i need a population control team
at jv 766 immediately  please 
check the other side  thomas 
there is 40 to 50 eggs in here 
is this normal   this
is an amazing find 
l can just show you a
little bit how it works 
basically  a cow is hung from
the ceiling  you can see here 
very little of it left  of
course  because all these pipes
supply the nutrition to
the little prawn eggs 
you can do one  i can show
you  want to see   no  i m fine 
there we go  okay  no
more nutrition to the guy 
then finally we take air back 
the little guy is gone to
a nice little sleep now 
you pop him out  there
we go  pop him out here 
you can take that  you wanna keep it
as a souvenir of your first abortion 
you can feel like you did one
of these here   thanks  boss 
okay  here it comes 
guys  this is the snake 
if we were going to abort
each egg one at the time 
it d take a very long time 
so  this makes a lot of sense 
you hear that  that s a popping
sound that you re hearing 
it s almost like a popcorn 
what the egg does  it pops up 
the little guy  what s
left of him  pops out there 
so that s the sound that
you re hearing with the popping 
you don t need that  man 
only sissies wear that 
been drinking a little bit here  eh 
what are you doing with this
television set  sir  what s this 
hey  smile for the cameras here 
that s a first day
find   that s a big find 
you see this  trent  look at this 
there s weapons all over here 
ck 5  7572   
some of the guns are small
but if it shoot you  it make a big mess 
mnu is trying to move the
aliens for humanitarian reasons 
but the real focus  just as it has been
right from the beginning  is weapons 
mnu is the second largest
weapons manufacturer in the world 
we assumed that we d be able
to pick up the alien laser gun
and just be able to shoot 
but it didn t work like that 
because  as we discovered 
their technology is actually
engineered in a biological manner to
interact exclusively with their dna 
it just doesn t work with humans 
and it s as simple as that 
this is basically a guy 
and there s 3 humans here 
basically trying to
make a warning  you know 
he s saying  i kill 3
humans  watch out for me  
hey  don t urinate on your own
bloody    get back  get back 
this is wikus  requesting
first battalion escort  please 
you want to talk to them
or you want to talk to me 
no  not them 
okay  guys  thanks very much 
yeah i know  he had a spade 
look i find some 
i tell you before    this is
human technology  it is useless 
only our technology contains the fluid 
this is not our
technology   no  it s junk 
keep looking 
i find something 
yes  this is what we need 
good  little one 
get down 
careful    wait   
   there 
why must it take so long 
because it is very difficult   
   so much can go wrong 
twenty years of work 
our plan is ready now 
  quiet    listen   
   they are coming 
you must hide this 
they must not find it 
answer the door and be polite 
no  you take it 
you see  this is the problem 
this is the gang sign 
you see this  so again 
looks like we have
more and more gang members 
fundiswa  you just stay
back  you stay behind thomas 
this place is swarming with
mnu  i will be searched 
i must get back to my son 
don t make them angry   be polite 
mnu agents  open the door please 
hello  we would like you
to     nobody is here 
okay  that s unexceptable 
that is totally unexceptable 
get out  get out  you stupid prawn 
  get outside 
  c mon  move  move 
on your knees   i m gonna have a look 
just stay there  right there 
sir  we have to serve
you an eviction notice 
do you understand it   no 
this is a classic kind of
gangsta shack  i can tell you 
we re gonna find weapons here 
watch your head  don t hit the cows 
just checking for
panels  ah  you hear that 
yeah  it s hollow there 
see  look at that 
i haven t see this type of
setup  it s almost like a   
chemistry type of a set 
it s gotta be something 
l don t know  this has got
the markings there of   
   so it is definitely alien 
but it s not a weapon 
but i don t trust it 
are you all right 
wikus  are you all right 
switch it off  please  just turn it off 
are you gonna cut that part
out  trent  where it sprays me 
  yeah  don t worry 
  you cut that 
we just found a dangerous object here 
it has a fuel in and i suspect it
might leak onto people or cause damage 
so we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab 
it s not a weapon but it s dangerous 
he s got weapons somewhere here 
my sense is telling me that 
lets check the other side
here  thomas   yes sir 
thomas  keep the gun on
him   ok  i got it sir

amazing 
all right  i think that s all we need 
gentlemen  we are running out of time 
this is the key stage
in the metamorphosis 
his dna is in perfect balance
between alien and human 
and a problem is  as
the infection spreads 
the transition becomes
permanent and less active 
he s going to turn into
one of them  a prawn 
what happens to him isn t important 
what s important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now 
this body represents
hundreds of millions 
maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology 
there are people out there 
governments  corporations 
who d kill for this chance 
will he survive the
procedure   no  of course not 
we need everything 
tissue  bone marrow  blood 
the procedure is gonna basically
strip him down to nothing   please   
what about next of kin

i don t understand 
none of this makes any sense 
he just hurt his arm  dad

doing their best to save him 
we re starting to harvest
material from the specimen 
we ll start with the soft tissue
first  cut through the chest cavern 
we need to get the heart
out as quickly as possible 
once it set the
sinuosity  it just spread 
you know wikus  he
never was very strong 
i ll go through the chest 
go straight into the heart 
be quiet  please   fuck you

best because he needed help

and he wasn t gonna
get that as a fugitive 
he became the most valuable
business artifact on earth 
he was the only human who had ever   
successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive 
but his real value was that he
could operate alien weaponry
