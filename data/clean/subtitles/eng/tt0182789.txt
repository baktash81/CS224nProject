northam robotics
household model ndr 1 1 4 
serial number 583625 
  hello 
  hello 
are you one s family 
well  um  i guess so 
it s scary 
it s not scary 
it s stupid 
  i doubt that 
 jenny harrison s family s got one 
  i doubt that 
 jenny harrison s family s got one 
  so does kate mcallister 
they re all the same 
  what is it 
  it s an android 
  what s an  andrew  
will that be one s name 
well  why not 
it sounds good 
  hello  andrew 
  hello  sir 
would you care to hear
the three laws of robotics 
  it s said to be a most
entertaining presentation 
  okay  sure 
  will you step back  sir 
to maximize presentation 
  right 
first law of robotics 
a robot may not injure a human being 
or  through inaction 
cause a human being to come to harm 
second law 
a robot must obey
all human orders 
except where those orders
come in conflict with the first law 
third law 
a robot must protect itself 
so long as doing so does not conflict
with the first two laws 
andrew 
don t ever do that again 
of course not  sir 
it is a one time only 
there is another option that
one is obligated to point out  sir 
you may have one
with or without personality 
  would you care to see a demo
of the personality chip 
  uh  no  no  thank you 
  we ll stick with what we ve got 
  a wise choice  sir  if one may say so 
well  you ll be staying down here 
got everything you need 
  one only requires access
to a power outlet 
  good 
right  well  um 
good night  andrew 
it certainly is  sir 
no  no  andrew 
the correct response to
 good night  is  good night  
  good night 
  yes 
  you just said  yes  
  yes 
but the correct response to
 good night  is  good night  
  good night  andrew 
  good night  sir 
  good night  andrew 
  good night  sir 
  you only need to say it once 
  or one would be saying it
forever  sir 
in an infinite verbal loop 
exactly 
  thank you  sir 
  good 
night 
sorry  sir 
honey  i don t want it   
following me around the house all day 
can t can t you turn it off
or something  please 
just give him a job 
it ll be okay 
  well  seat belts 
 seatbelts 
good morning 
mr  martin  today s temperature
will be in the high 70s 
bye  mom 
  have a good day  sweethearts 
  have a good day  sweethearts 
  mmm  andrew  this is very good 
  thank you  sir 
 don t you think 
  i think it sucks 
 sucks   how 
chickens do not have lips 
she s being rude  you mind your manners 
young lady  please 
  we re fine  andrew 
  indeed you are  sir 
the kitchen 
it s fine too  sir 
no 
go to the kitchen now 
hello 
come on

just a pretty face 
check 
oh  andrew  could you come up 
  should l 
  no  it ll be fine 
  yes  miss 
  andrew  would you please
open the window 
one is glad
to be of service 
a lovely breeze 
now jump 
no 
out the window 
  did you hear something 
  was that an earthquake 
sorry for the inconvenience 
may one re re re enter   
  er er 
  what happened  andrew 
for the sake of family harmony 
one is programmed not to tell 
  andrew  andrew 
yeah 
amanda  grace 
downstairs right away 
  come in  andrew 
  thank you  si i i r 
andrew s not a person 
he s a form of property 
one is not
a per r r r r r r 
son 
but property is
also important 
so from now on 
as a matter of principle 
in this family andrew will be treated
as if he were a person 
which means there will be
no more attempts to break him 
break him 
your sister tried
to kill andrew 
you too 
  shh 
  sorry 
come on 
everyone up to bed 
  will you be all right  andrew 
  one is capable of
self mai ai aintenance  sir 
good 
  good night  andrew 
  good night  andrew 
guh  guh  guh 
g good night 
good night  andrew  good    night 
miss  one has been given
specific orders for your safety 
and that is an unsafe area 
now  come down 
okay 
thank you 
 well  i think it s gonna be
sunny tonight  
  me too  
 so do l  
he s my favorite 
pretty 
would you like
to hold him 
that was my favorite 
they don t even
make him anymore 
  can it be repaired  little miss 
  no  it can t 
  you re screwed 
  i hate you 
get away from me 
  can we fix him 
  no  look at him 
he s in a million pieces 
  i m sorry  there s
nothing you can do 
put the rest of them away 
wow 
 andrew 
  yes  little miss 
this is the best present
i ever got 
one is glad
to be of service 
would you please
come with me 
does this involve
a window 
no 
you can sit here 
his name is woof 
and from now on   
he s yours 
  woof 
  uh huh 
because sometimes
he barks 
once he gets to know you 
oh 
thank you very much 
you re welcome 
i have to go
to sleep now  andrew 
  yes 
  yeah  can you  kinda 
of course 
  good night  sweetheart 
  good night  andrew 
  little miss 
  sure  thanks 
miss 
  after you 
  well  thank you 
you re welcome 
andrew  did you
really make this 
yes  sir 
a robot cannot
tell a lie  andrew 
that is not
entirely correct  sir 
one could lie 
if one were ordered to lie 
or if it were necessary to tell
some untruth in order to keep
a human being from harm 
  or if one s own safety were
in jeopardy  sir 
  andrew 
one did indeed carve that
for little miss 
  and the design 
you re responsible for that 
  yes  sir 
  what did you copy it from 
  copy it  ma am 
well  i mean  you didn t just get it
out of thin air 
you got it out of some book 
right  or used the computer
to plot it out 
one did nothing more than study
the raw material for a time   
until one came to understand how best
to carve it into a shape   
that would appeal to little miss s
love of tiny mammals 
yes  yes 
please come in 
i am so glad you called 
mansky  dennis mansky 
richard mark 
and an ndr 114 
now  i got your message 
but what exactly is it doing 
well  what interests me is
he shows a number of characteristics 
like creativity 
curiosity  friendship 
that  frankly 
have taken us by surprise 
mm hmm 
  andrew 
  yes  dennis 
social as well 
now i d like to show you
something if i may 
now  andrew carved these 
these are
original works of art 
and last night andrew said 
   i enjoy making them  
    enjoy  
  yes 
  should one not use that word 
no  no  it s fine  andrew 
see what i mean 
it s unusual  surely 
to hear a robot talk
about enjoying something 
what i want to know is 
do many of your other robots
have  have feelings like this 
must be   
something in the pathways 
so  then  will you be wanting
a refund or a replacement 
no  neither  i just wanted
to get your reaction to andrew 
i wanted to know what you think 
he s unique 
wouldn t you say 
it is an anomaly 
no refund  no replacement 
how much do you want 
  i don t think i understand 
  well 
clearly you realize
if word of this gets out 
we ll have to recall our entire line 
we re in people s homes  sir 
with their children 
if it is doing what you say 
it can also run amok 
one is not qualified
to run  mucks  
all right  sir 
if i let you have andrew 
you ll what 
you ll disassemble him  will you 
carefully  yes 
we would need to trace the actual course
of andrew s neural pathways 
replace the positronic brain 
then put it 
him  back together
and return him to you  good as new 
now  these neural pathways
are presumably fragile 
isn t it possible  in the course
of these procedures 
that something might go wrong 
we would make
every conceivable effort 
and  in the unlikely event
that something did go wrong 
you d  of course 
replace andrew 
of course 
even though he s unique
and irreplaceable 
he  his 
you s 
well  it s a natural error 
it has human form 
therefore you read mechanical
failure as eccentricity   
and anthropomorphize it 
it is a household appliance 
and yet you act
like it is a man 
we re leaving 
come on  andrew 
please  i beg you
to reconsider  mr  martin 
let us examine andrew 
talk to your wife  name your price 
now  listen to me 
there is no price for individuality 
he is  for better or for worse 
my robot 
and you will never
lay your hands on him 
do you understand 
all in good time 
you see  sooner or later
you ll have to bring it in for repairs 
  andrew  i ve made a decision 
  yes  sir 
you will cut back on your workload 
you can no longer   
devote yourself entirely
to children and housework 
but one likes the children  sir 
specifically the smaller one 
little miss 
that is a contradiction  andrew 
and that is exactly the sort of
thing you need to learn about 
thank you for choosing
northam robotics 
  so we need a new regimen 
  regimen  sir 
first offal  you ll spend part
of each day making something 
so as not to offend humans 
we d better find something
that s not overly artistic 
could you make other things 
i could teach you my line of work 
you know 
timepieces and clocks and so on 
one could not tell you  sir 
one has never attempted such things 
well  you will now 
also  you ll spend part of each evening
in instruction with me 
  and what is the purpose
of this instruction 
  to teach you  andrew 
to teach you all the things
that haven t been programmed into you 
andrew  you re unique 
  unique 
  thank you
for choosing northam robotics 
and i feel a responsibility
to help you   
become whatever
you re able to be 
and what is one
able to be 
well  i don t know 
see  people grow
through time 
but then  of course  for you  time
is a completely different proposition 
  for you  time is endless 
  endless 
  is this a good piece 
  very 
  what about this one 
  excellent 
it was
a lucky april shower
it was
the most convenient door
i found
a million dollar baby
in a five and ten cent
store
and  nine months later 
a baby is born 
and those  andrew 
are the so called facts of life 
people actually do this 
sir 
  well  yes 
 and married people 
one supposes they see it
as some kind of requirement
or obligation 
well  it 
  it s not exactly
an obligation  andrew 
  that s a relief 
and it is the natural
and preferable way to conceive children 
sir  offal these millions
of sperm  only one makes it 
  that s true 
  what happens to the others 
well  they die 
they die  
one feels badly for them 
well  one does 
  but it s completely agreed
that it feels good 
  for both parties  sir 
in an ideal world 
  so people do it rather frequently 
  how often  sir 
  well  as often as they can 
matter of fact 
  ahh 
at least at first 
sir 
  may one speak frankly with you 
  as always  andrew 
it s just
that the whole process 
it sounds so messy 
i think
that s a fair comment 
they die 
  isn t it 
  what 
  it s called  humor   
    humor  
yes  people tell jokes
to make each other laugh 
and this laughter gives
pleasure  sir 
yes 
sir  could you teach one
to tell a joke 
well  l let s see  um 
two drunks walk into a bar 
wouldn t two drunks walk
out of a bar  sir 
you walk into a bar to drink 
and you come out drunk 
let s try something simpler  andrew 
um 
  knock knock 
    knock knock  
no  knock knock 
someone s at the door 
  shall one get it  sir 
  no  no  no 
y you say   who s there  
andrew 
  who s there  andrew 
  no  just  who s there  
one does not know  sir 
let s start with something
a little simpler  andrew 
why did the chicken
cross the road 
one does not know  sir 
possibly a predator was
behind the chicken 
or  possibly  there was
a female chicken on the other
side  if it s a male chicken 
or possibly a food source
or  depending on the season 
it might be migrating 
one hopes there s no traffic 
to get to the other side 
 to get to the other side  
ohhh 
why is that funny 
  so  what do you kids have
planned for the day 
  probably stick with andrew 
  what about you  miss 
  i m gonna go play
at my friend natalie s house 
oh 
may one  sir 
is now a good time 
what  a good time for what 
  last night  sir taught one 
  no  no  no  don don t blame me 
andrew  just go ahead 
thank you  sir 
two cannibals were eating a clown 
one turns to the other and says 
  does this taste funny to you  
how do you make a hanky dance 
put a little boogie in it 
what is a brunette between two blondes 
translator 
do you know why blind people
don t like to skydive 
it scares their dogs 
a man with dementia is driving
on the freeway  his wife calls
and says   sweetheart 
i heard there s someone driving
the wrong way on the freeway   
he says 
 one  there s hundreds  
what s silent  smells like worms 
bird farts 
  it must have been an engineer
who designed the human body 
who else would put
a waste processing plant
next to a recreation area 
a woman goes into a doctor s
office  the doctor says 
  mind if i numb your breasts  
    not at all  
  num num num num num  
  one did it  sir 
andrew  it was fine  but
we might want to talk about   
appropriateness
and  um  and timing 
  it s 1 0 1 5  sir 
  oh  andrew 
  little miss 
would you like me to teach you
how to play a duet 
  certainly 
  come on 
okay  ready  you start here 
and then just follow me 
  i play first  okay 
  all right 
ready 
your turn 
good  very good 
now together 
that was wonderful  thanks 
thank you  little miss 
hi  mom 
grace  is it possible for you to find
somewhere more private to do that 
no problem 
just give me your credit disc
and we ll get a hotel room 
  what did you say to me 
  let s go 
what did you say to me 
young lady 
you get off that bike this minute 
and you are grounded 
  get  go on  get out of here 
you piece of scum 
richard 
does this look right 
hi  mom 
  didn t you talk to her about that boy 
  mmm  well  not yet 
  oh 
  but i will 
kind of hoping
it s a phase that ll pass 
 like the others 
i am so sick
of these damn clocks 
i ve already given
half them away 
  perhaps we should sell them 
  sell them 
well  it s an idea 
well  who gets the money 
well  i imagine we will 
but andrew does
all the work 
  yes  but andrew s our 
  then andrew should get the money 
andrew is a robot 
what conceivable use
would a robot have for money 
robots don t go shopping 
robots don t go on vacations 
robots don t eat dinners
in fancy restaurants 
i can t believe we re
having this discussion 
dad  it doesn t matter
what he is 
andrew deserves to benefit
from the work he does 
sweetheart 
i will do what s right
for andrew 
of course i will 
but at the end of the day
we are talking about a machine 
and you can t invest
your emotions in a machine 
right 
  can i get you anything 
  no  thank you 
  there you are  how are ya 
  bill  good morning 
  this must be andrew 
  andrew  bill feingold  family lawyer 
  andrew 
  you own one of my clocks 
this is one of my favorites 
do you enjoy it 
uh  yes  i do 
very much 
  i like the new office  bill 
what floor are we on here 
  thirty seven 
hmm 
andrew  come
and have a look at this 
no  thank you  sir 
  you sure 
  no 
how can i help you 
as you know  andrew s earned
a great deal of money
from his endeavors 
and what he really wants to do
is open his own bank account 
  a bank account
in the name of a robot 
  mmm  would that be legal 
i couldn t say 
there are no precedents 
i don t think there s a law
against it  but  uh 
richard  why  why do you want
to give him a bank account 
what s he need money for 
to pay for things 
of course  which otherwise
sir would have to pay for 
one would like
to pull one s own 
  weight 
  for what  sir 
  andrew 
  yes  little miss 
ooh  oh 
  oh  oh  i m so sorry 
  oh 
not to worry 
it can be repaired 
wow 
oh  left 
andrew  remember frank 
my boyfriend 
yes  the one your sister says
has a nice ass 
oh 
last night 
last night he asked me
to marry him 
one gathers
that is a good thing 
  well  i haven t said  yes  yet 
  so there is doubt 
no 
frank is wonderful 
he s handsome 
he s reliable 
he s somebody i could spend
the rest of my life with 
i could have children with him 
then what is the problem 
  board 
  no  not at all 
  not him  there 
  oh 
well  i have this friend   
that s very special to me 
he s just so sweet and funny 
and whenever i m with him   
i don t want to be with frank 
one can see that would
create a complication 
yes 
but the answer s
staring you in the face 
marry your friend 
  what 
well  he s not 
i mean  h he 
a relationship between us
would be impossible  really 
it could never work out 
  why 
  well  because he s not 
because he he ll never be 
yes 
is something wrong 
no 
nothing s wrong 
nothing at all 
thank you
for listening to me 
one is glad
to be of service 
little miss 
what will you do
about frank 
accept his proposal 
really 
humans 
  andrew 
  yes 
it would mean so much to me
if you would be an usher at my wedding 
one is unfamiliar with this term 
how does one  ush  
you help people to their seats 
you wear a tuxedo 
  one would wear clothing 
  yes 
one has never been asked
to wear clothing 
  it would be an honor 
  great 
  one still is all thumbs 
installed what 
um  an alarm 
if you try to enter andrew s brain
while you re making this repair 
the police will be alerted 
also  you should probably know that 
if you actually injure
andrew s brain or positronic
pathways in anyway 
my lawyer  the good mr  feingold 
will be happy to sue you 
he will sue you
for the lost value of andrew s
income until the end of time 
well  i think
we understand each other 
good 
sir  one more item of business 
as long is one is in the shop 
can you do work on one s face 
one wishes to have
more expression 
one has thoughts and feelings
that presently do not show 
you want your thoughts and
feelings to show on your face 
yes  like the contempt
that you are showing me right now 
well  we have done
some experimentation 
we are able to give robots
superficial responses   
which mimic human expression 
  one has read that there have
been ndr upgrades 
  yes  yes 
we ve worked up
a dozen experimental models
with expression capabilities 
sleeker body types 
we ran some market surveys and decided
not to go ahead with the line 
  why not 
  negative consumer reaction 
there s a growing fear that
robots will continue to make   
the human work force obsolete 
andrew has worked
for me for over 1 5 years 
there s no danger of anyone
losing their job to him 
surely there s no concern
performing these modifications
on an old style robot 
true 
but procedures like that would
be prohibitively expensive 
it is understood that you will attempt
to rivet one 
  screw  andrew 
  really  how much 
that is roughly
one s monthly salary 
it s more than i make
in a year 
hmm  not bad for 
  what did you call him
last time we were here 
  household appliance 
  household appliance 
  household appliance  yes 
may the peace of the lord
be with you always 
i now pronounce you
husband and wife 
you may kiss the bride now 
it is my pleasure to present
mr  and mrs  frank charney 
what 
good evening  sir 
magnificent night 
you look very sharp
this evening  andrew 
thank you  sir 
  it was quite challenging
for the tailor 
may one continue
wearing clothing 
  if it suits you 
  are you serious 
as always 
well  i suppose so 
we ll have to find you some
other stuff  though 
you can t wear tails all the time 
really  how sad 
  sit down  andrew  please 
  thank you  sir 
  it was a wonderful wedding 
wasn t it 
  oh  yes  sir 
and  if one may say 
you are a spectacular dancer 
  well  that s very kind 
  not at all  sir  it s the truth 
did you record the day 
every second  sir 
is in one s memory bank 
well  let s watch it 
shall we 
sir 
is everything all right 
um 
they ve both gone now 
andrew 
well  things change 
things always change 
people move on 
it s as it should be 
but  uh 
what i realized today is
that  uh 
i ll never stop missing them 
sir 
one is still here 
and one is glad of that 
andrew  thank you 
  good night  sir 
  good night  andrew 
lloyd  come here 
what did i tell you
now apologize to andrew 
i will not apologize to it 
  him 
  it 
  lloyd 
  sorry 
one understands why
some animals eat their young 
i m so sorry  andrew 
are you all right 
you seem very quiet 
how does one
obtain freedom 
  y you wish to leave us 
  not at all  little miss 
one merely wishes
to be declared free 
but why  you have
so much freedom here 
until one is ordered
to do something 
andrew  it s been years
since anyone s given you an order 
but you may still request one
to perform tasks 
well  we ask all the time 
but it s a request  not an order 
but that s not enough
for you  is it 
one has studied your history 
terrible wars have been fought
where millions have died   
for one idea 
freedom 
and it seems that something that means
so much to so many people   
would be worth having 
sir  would now be a good time
to speak with you 
it s always a good time 
andrew  you know that 
it is everything
in one s bank account 
why would you want to give me 
to purchase one s freedom 
one wants to be free 
one would  of course 
still obey the three laws   
and serve you
in exactly the same fashion 
the only thing that would change
would be the form 
one would no longer be
your property 
you want to leave 
that s what this is about  isn t it 
not at all  sir 
you are one s family 
then why ask for this 
oh  i see 
you re in on this 
we ve talked about it  yes 
so you ordered him to do it 
and he obeyed 
no  he makes
his own decisions 
  but you put the idea in his head 
  no  father  you did 
you ve given him hundreds
of books to read 
it was simply a matter of time
before he became intrigued
by the idea of freedom 
he learns and grows
all the time 
and it s because of you
and andrew s abilities   
that he s become every bit
as complex as we are 
good morning  sir 
  you take your check back 
please  andrew 
  why  sir 
you are free now 
i must ask you
to leave this house 
but sir 
i don t wish to leave 
you wished for freedom 
you must accept the consequences 
  then i will remove my belongings 
  yes 
where will you go 
i will look for
a residence nearby   
so that if you ever
need anything  sir 
that will not happen 
andrew  thank you 
there s no need
to be close by 
  if you command me
not to do this  i will obey 
  i command nothing 
you re free 
then  called or uncalled 
i am always at your service 
andrew 
you ve stopped referring
to yourself as  one  
a home of my own 
andrew 
  andrew 
  i m in here 
little miss 
is something wrong 
he asked for you 
it s time 
  the robot s here 
  andrew 
  hello  miss 
  andrew 
sir 
  how are you  sir 
  well  i m dying  andrew 
otherwise i m fine 
wonderful to see you again 
i m very happy to see you  andrew 
it s been a long time 
yes  it has  sir 
i wanted to 
i wanted to tell you   
that i was wrong 
you re never wrong  sir 
then don t contradict me 
you were right
to want your freedom 
and i m glad
that you have it 
thank you  sir 
andrew 
you were very good to us 
it was an honor
serving you  sir 
i want to seek out
my own kind 
in order to understand
my destiny 
i must know if there is
another like myself 
northam robotics will not
return my inquiries 
and now that you have
finally passed the bar  lloyd 
i want you to sue them for
information of the whereabouts
offal ndr series robots 
if you don t mind 
the freedom of information act
doesn t quite cover suits by robots 
  not yet 
  mother  i m a very busy man 
i do not have time
to help   
it pursue
some ridiculous lawsuit 
lloyd  sweetheart 
i do love you 
but sometimes i have to wonder
if you really are my child 
well  that s mutation 
mother 
the miracle of genetics is
i m not you 
no  you ve always been
more like your father 
so that s why
you divorced him 
sorry 
andrew  what would you do if i got
the information on these other ndrs 
i would seek them out 
each and every one 
so you d be gone
for quite a long time 
oh  yes 
several years if not more 
if my calculations are
correct 
i d love to help you 
did he not breast feed 
 dear little miss 
my journey is nearing the end
of its tenth year 
and i still have not found
any robot that bears
any similarity to myself 
i have thousands of miles to go 
hundreds of cities to visit 
so i have not given up hope 
love  andrew   
hello 
my last name is martin 
hey  get off the field 
 dear little miss 
my journey is nearing its end 
i have exhausted all possibilities
save for one final ray of hope 
i ve learned of an ndr robot
that has recently been rebuilt
back home in san francisco   
take as many as you need 
oh  then you should love them 
i ll be right back 
take as many as you need 
  thank you 
  you re quite welcome 
  whoo
  what you want
baby  i got it
  whoo  whoo
  what you need
do you know i got it
  whoo  whoo
 all i m askin 
 is for a little respect
when you come home
 just a little bit
  hey  baby

just a little bit
  mister
i ain t gonna do you wrong
while you re gone

if i don t wanna
  whoo
  whoo  whoo
  all i m askin 
  is for a little respect
when ya come home
  just a little bit
  baby  when you get home
  just a little bit
  just a little bit
just a little bit
  yeah
hi 
  is this yours 
  oh 
thank you 
i m looking for rupert burns 
oh  you ve come
to the right place 
  come in 
  certainly have 
huh 
  do you have a name 
  of course i do 
galatea 
galatea 
you have an amazing   
agility 
you were dancing
in the market 
  did you like that 
  very much 
dancing is
the sportiest sport 
and we re so much better
at it than humans 
i can t believe
i finally found you 
when did you know 
  know what 
  that you were unique 
oh  i knew that right away 
me too 
you and l 
we re the same 
we have personality 
is your personality chip
turned on 
  isn t yours 
  no 
sucks to be you 
i think personality is
much more fun than intelligence 
don t you 
  baby  baby  sweet baby
  i think so 
there s somethin 
that i ve just got to say
can i help you 
your robot is just
a standard ndr  isn t she 
yeah  i m afraid so 
why does she have
the ability to dance 
 cause l  uh 
i put a modified skeletal chip
into her during a rebuild 
  how were you able
to do that modification 
  my father taught me 
he created the android unit
at northam robotics 
he s responsible for
the technology that allows you
to mimic human expression 
  what happened to him 
  well  northam laid him off
when they shut down the unit 
so he started this place 
and i took over when he died 
  i m sorry to hear that 
  he would have been
absolutely thrilled to meet you 
i l i m rupert burns 
  it s a real honor 
  the honor is mine 
  hey  you and l  we re the same 
  let s get loco  robo 
whoo hoo 
  shut her off or i will 
  oh 
okay 
thank you 
is this your father s work 
yeah  well  it s 
it s our work  you could say 
i haven t really been able
to restrain myself from continuing   
to tinker with the relentlessly
unfashionable android technology 
as a matter of fact 
i ve actually gotten to a point   
where i can pretty much
exactly replicate the external
physical appearance   
of a human being 
  remarkable 
  thank you 
  amazing 
  yeah 
unfortunately  nobody seems terribly
interested in funding my research 
  but 
  i am 
i will fund your research 
yeah 
that d be cool 
thank you  darlin   okay 
andrew  i want to make it
very clear 
this is an external physical
upgrade only in the strictest
sense of the word 
you ll feel nothing 
none of your internal mechanisms
will be changed 
you ll still be subject
to the parameters
of your positronic brain 
  is that clear 
  understood 
okay  good  now 
have you given any thought
whatsoever as to what age
you d like to be 
officially 
i am 62 years old 
  let s take off 25 years 
what do ya say 
  fifteen 
  twenty  good 
  perfect 
now  andrew  believe it or not 
the secret to all this is actually   
  imperfection 
  imperfection 
yeah  things like   
wrinkles  uh 
less than perfect teeth 
details like fading scars 
little pockmark 
look at my nose 
see my nose 
  it s bulbous and slightly irregular 
  it is 
well  i m the only one
who s got my nose 
and that s what makes me  me 
we need to incorporate
these features into your design   
so that you can be
the only one of you 
that s what makes us unique 
is those imperfections 
i see 
like the shape of your head 
  what about the shape of my head 
  it s huge 
oh 
but lovely 
thank you 
oh 
ah  oh 
  what happened  what s going on 
what happened 
i saw the inner me 
  is it ready 
  okay 
please  be careful 
don t drop me 
  i m being careful  oh  my god 
just relax 
relax  relax 
why did you do that 
that wasn t very funny 
just keepin  ya
on your toes 
  i don t have any toes 
  you do now 
i do 
and hands 
and fingers 
how do i look 
see for yourself 
thank you 
  beautiful 
 sorry 
  who are you 
andrew 
andrew 
you look wonderful 
even younger 
  how do you do that 
  do do i know you 
well  i know
i look different too 
  i ve had an upgrade  touch it 
  what 
  no  oh  no  no 
  sorry  the face 
what s going on 
you leave her alone 
  who are you 
  andrew 
no  andrew 
  yes 
  but andrew s a robot 
  yes  i am 
well  now  an android 
  he s had an upgrade 
  i know that 
  oh 
  hello 
hello  it is you 
  you know him 
  yes 
  you know me 
  yes 
  who are you  no 
  i m little miss  yes 
  that s little miss 
  no 
  no  no 
  no 
  no  that s portia 
  portia  yes 
  portia 
  yes 
  who s portia 
  my granddaughter 
  your granddaughter 
  yes  yes 
  is this some kind of trick 
  no 
  you re little miss 
  yes 
why do you have to look
like her 
  there is and can be
only one little miss 
  really 
  yes 
  it s a genetic resemblance 
sometimes it skips a generation 
  i don t care  i don t like it 
  i can see that 
but if you took a moment 
which i see you re not
inclined to do right now 
you d realize portia and i
are very different people 
  why is she imitating you 
  what s so funny 
  you are 
i m not trying
to be funny 
things have certainly
changed around here 
that happens
after 20 years 
i have so much to tell you 
come  come with me 
it is you 
yes 
portia 
  hello  my friend 
  hello  little miss 
whose daughter is she 
  lloyd s 
  oh  now the rudeness makes sense 
go 
go home to your master 
you don t have a home 
do you 
i don t have food 
i don t eat 
come in  we ll keep
each other company 
i know you don t like me 
well  i don t like you either 
i just wanna make that clear 
  it couldn t be more clear
if you spat in my face 
  i can t 
i don t have
a mucous gland 
would it be possible to have
a slightly longer conversation 
may my canine companion
enter also 
thank you 
is this your sculpture 
no  i m restoring it 
i m a preservation architect 
it s quite horrendous 
how ugly was it
before you restored it 
  listen  first  you get mad
at me because of how i look 
  mm hmm 
tonight you show up at my door 
announce that you don t like me 
and then you criticize my work 
once again  i apologize
for telling the truth 
but it can t be helped 
it s my programming 
what is it exactly
that you want 
family 
my last name is martin 
i am so named because
your great grandfather
and grandmother   
considered me to be
a member of your family 
now  sir is dead 
little miss is getting older 
you don t like me  but at least
you ll talk to me if i knock
on your door long enough 
  is that a joke 
  no 
would you like to hear a joke 
this buddhist walks up
to a hot dog vendor and says 
  make me one
with everything  
  andrew  do you  do you have
any friends at all 
  no 
only woofy  who s very sweet 
but not very challenging
on a conversational level 
that is the extent
of his skills 
  so you want someone
to talk to 
  with 
  even if that person doesn t like you 
  you can t have everything 
is that right  is it 
 you can have everything  
seems like some people do 
so i m somewhat confused
on that level 
  sit down  let s talk 
  thank you 
mm hmm 
hey there  handsome  andrew 
could i get you anything to drink 
  sorry  i have no stomach 
  oh  could i get something for him 
  he has a stomach  yes 
  do you think he s hungry 
  how is she 
  she s sleeping 
what happened 
she had a stroke 
mm  there you are 
little miss 
hmm 
she s gone 
it s cruel that you can cry
and i cannot 
here is a terrible pain
i cannot express 
will every human being
that i care for   
just    leave 
i m afraid so 
that won t do 
andrew  this is remarkably impressive 
you did this all by yourself  
yes  i downloaded every known
medical textbook into my memory 
i studied them  that s how i came up
with these drawings 
i know they re very primitive
and not entirely complete 
but that s why i need you
to fill in the mechanical gaps  rupert 
this is another upgrade 
it s considerably more than an upgrade 
i mean  you re 
you re talking about
a profound transition   
from the mechanical
to the biological 
i realize that  and i believe
it is the ideal marriage of both fields 
not only that  but this stuff
could cut both ways 
i don t think that any
existing prosthetic devices
or artificial organs   
hold a candle
to what you ve designed here 
you could use these
in human beings as well 
exactly 
wow 
  what a piece of fecal matter 
  shit 
  excuse me 
  what a piece of shit 
i know that 
no  that s way you say
when you re frustrated 
you say  piece of shit  
    piece of shit  
  yes  but but with feeling 
oh  what a piece of shit 
  more 
  what a piece of shit 
  good  very good 
  thank you 
now  are you aware
that what you ve essentially
designed here   
is the equivalent of the human
central nervous system 
  that was my intention  yes 
  okay 
well  you gotta realize
that a nervous system is going to   
radically enhance the way that you feel
and perceive the world around you 
i m not just talking about hot and cold
and little tiny pinpricks 
put it this way 
as your experience
becomes varied 
so will the feelings 
emotions  sensations   
stimulated
by that experience 
and while some of these
will be very subtle   
and wonderful
and nuanced and shaded 
others will be profoundly intense
and difficult to tolerate 
do you feel like
you re ready for that 
absolutely 
  lovely 
  thank you 
i was referring
to the statue 
i know 
could you fix
this piece of shit 
i don t know 
let me take a look 
  andrew  i m sure you could
restore this yourself 
  yes  i could 
but you could do it
much better 
well  i d be happy
to fix it for you 
  if it s not too much effort 
  no  not at all 
i ve been working all day 
and i could really use some air 
do you wanna go for a walk 
oh  that would be
quite splendid  yes 
  why are you laughing at me 
you re just 
you re always so polite and so proper 
  it s very sweet 
  thank you 
let s go 
thank you 
when a man s
an empty kettle
he should be
on his mettle
and yet
i m torn apart
it s because i m presumin 
that i could be kinda human
if i only
had a heart
  picture me
  do you have an impact drill 
  uh  yeah  over on the rack 
  thank you 
 jesus 
there s a party next week   
to celebrate the opening
of the building that i restored 
and all my friends
will be there 
and it would be great
if you could come 
i would love to 
thank you 
i think
you re letting me win 
checkmate 
i love all
the many charms
about you
above all
i want my arms
about you
don t
don t be
a naughty  naughty baby
come to mama
come to mama  do
my sweet
embraceable
you
charles  why don t you
go get us a drink 
sure 
  thank you  thank you 
the very thought of you
and i forget to do
the simple
ordinary things
that everyone
ought to do
i m living in
a kind of daydream
i m happy as a king
and foolish
though it may seem
to me you re everything
the mere idea of you
though i m here for you
you ll never know
how slow
the moments go
till i m near you
  i never understood the phrase
 pearls before swans  
  what 
  swine 
oh  then the ballet is not
swine lake 
oh  god  nobody
makes me laugh like you 
laughter is essential
for a good friendship 
yes  it is 
sometimes i get
the feeling that   
you feel a certain way
about us   
and    that you   
wish or 
  what 
i don t know 
it s just a little 
having this conversation
with 
  a robot 
  yes 
i l mean 
a thing is itself  andrew 
a tree is a tree 
water is water  you   
are a magnificent machine 
but no matter how much
you change  that s what
you ll always be 
no  i can t believe that 
will not believe that 
i realize i m not
entirely human 
that s why people don t
always like or understand me 
  i like you 
  you do 
i even understand you   
some of the time 
but l 
i can t invest my emotions
in a machine 
must be a genetic trait 
things change  portia 
things always change 
she laughed at me 
 a thing is itself  andrew 
water is water  
what about ice 
what about steam  hmm 
andy  you gotta calm down 
okay 
do you know what it s like
to be laughed at 
humiliating 
it s an abomination 
look at me 
look what i m doing here 
i am trying to make
something of myself 
i am trying to fulfill my destiny 
does she notice 
  andrew 
  yes 
i don t want you
to take this personally 
but i have to work now 
  good night 
  good ni 
where ve you been 
i ve been trying to call you 
  poke me in the eye 
poke me in the eye  portia 
  what 
  you re crazy 
  poke me in the eye 
ow  ow 
that hurts  ow 
  it works 
  what the hell is going on 
it s my neural net  i am the proud owner
of a central nervous system 
  you can feel 
  oh  yes  very much 
will you do something
for me 
  will you perform an experiment
just for the sake of science 
  all right 
kiss me 
no  not there  here 
thank you 
could you feel it 
it s wonderful 
it s everything
they say it is 
and you 
portia  what s wrong 
charles and i are
getting married 
he s a lucky man 
congratulations
to the both of you 
goddamn it  andrew 
  if you re gonna succeed
at this thing 
  what thing 
this thing you re trying to do 
you ve got to stop being
so damn deferential 
  i can t help being deferential 
it s built in 
  then change 
change 
i have changed 
i don t mean on the outside 
change on the inside 
  take chances  make mistakes 
  mistakes 
yes  sometimes it s important
not to be perfect  okay 
  it s important to do the wrong thing 
  do the wrong thing 
  yes 
  why  oh  i see 
to learn from your mistakes 
no  to make them 
to find out what s real and what s not 
to find out what you feel 
human beings are
terrible messes  andrew 
i ll grant you that 
i see 
this is what is known as
an irrational conversation  isn t it 
no  this is
a human conversation 
it s not about being rational 
it s about following your heart 
  and that s what i should do 
  yes 
and you have a heart 
andrew  you do 
i feel it  i don t
even believe it sometimes 
but i do feel it 
and in order to follow
that heart 
one must do
the wrong thing 
yes 
thank you 
galatea  could you be
a little more careful 
that s very delicate equipment 
  sorry 
  what are you doing 
  near as i can tell  your bitch work 
my what 
oh  you heard me 
and i m sick of it 
all day long it s   yes  rupert  sir  
  no  rupert  sir  
 would you like another beverage 
rupert  sir  
and it chaps my ass 
so here s
a helpful hint for you 
shut up 
and let me do my work 
  no  no 
i m done 
 chaps my ass  
  give me back the chip 
where s the chip 
  i replaced it 
andrew  she s uncooperative 
she s abusive  she s confrontational 
and a lot more interesting 
don t you think 
arguably  but we re not getting
any work done  andrew 
please  please 
give me the old personality chip back 
fine  she can be perky again 
perky  she s just a ro 
i didn t mean it that way 
andrew  andrew 
i really didn t mean that 
what s the matter with you today 
andrew  where you going 
hey  jamie  come over here 
i want you to meet charles 
  charles  my aunt jamie 
  hi  nice to meet you 
  this is ryan 
  hey  ryan 
this is michael 
the boys are great 
  rupert 
  what s going on 
what s going on 
portia s parents are throwing
an engagement party   
  that i wasn t invited
to for obvious reasons 
  yeah 
  there he is 
  who 
  the prospective groom 
  where 
where  the one in the pale blue suit
with the big pointy chin 
  he s got a pointy chin 
  pointy chin  you could put
an eye out with that chin 
yeah  that s nothing
compared to his teeth  look at that 
i m amazed he s out
in daylight 
he s got
funny teeth  huh 
you need to upgrade
your eyes 
that shouldn t stop portia 
she can marry who ever she likes 
it s just that one day she s gonna
wake up next to him and realize   
that she is married to a man
whose face closely resembles
an antique can opener 
you know  the kind that used to go 
you know  the ones that move around
and can pops off 
  you re jealous  you are jealous 
  no  i m not  no  i m not 
you are  otherwise what are you
doing sneaking around here 
spying on portia  huh 
my god  i am jealous 
if i m jealous 
that means i m in love 
hi 
oh  thanks for coming 
if i m in love 
then all hope is gone 
i ve lost her 
andrew  andrew 
andy  would you like
a sip of my beer 
it would be a waste 
i could not taste it 
  what if you could 
  it would be exquisite 
i ve come up with a design 
a modification  rather 
that  if i m correct 
would enable you to deal
with solid foods and liquids 
  and taste 
  taste too 
and also 
if my schematics
are correct 
i think i ve come up
with a method   
to make you   
a complete man 
complete 
complete 
complete 
not in a reproductive sense 
of course 
but in terms
of approximating   
the physical sensation 
you know  that occurs 
friction 
  sexual relations 
  yeah 
oh  i ve always been
fascinated by that 
well  i mean  curious   
because 
  well  because of what they say 
  what do they say 
that you can lose yourself 
everything 
all boundaries  all time 
the two bodies can become
so mixed up   
that you don t know
who s who or what s what 
and just when the sweet
confusion is so intense
you think you re gonna die 
you kind of do 
leaving you alone
in your separate body 
but the one you love
is still there 
that s a miracle 
you can go to heaven
and come back alive 
you can go back
anytime you want 
with the one you love 
  and you want to experience that 
  oh  yes  please 
so do l 
we ll have to hire more people 
maybe two more weeks 
andrew 
  excuse me  i ll be right back 
  sure 
  i didn t expect to see you 
i remember this place
very well 
this is where your grandmother
was married 
yeah  i wanted it ready
for my own wedding 
so  you re not
married yet 
no  two weeks
from saturday 
i m not too late 
are you absolutely positive
you re doing the right thing 
  positive 
  about getting married 
  i m never absolutely positive 
  so you could be doing
the wrong thing 
  no  i m pretty sure
i m doing the right thing 
  great 
  why is that great 
  in your apartment  you told me
to do the wrong thing 
now  you are not doing the wrong thing 
you re doing the right thing 
it s safe to say you re not
following your own advice 
 cause if you were 
you would definitely not be
marrying this man  charles 
  because i would be doing
the right thing 
  precisely 
in some strange way 
you re starting to make sense 
good  do you have any idea what
it s like to be in love with someone   
who s about to marry
someone else 
someone totally magnificent 
someone who walks into a room
and lights it up like the sun 
someone who you know
is lying to herself 
  lying 
  convincingly  yeah 
very  very much so 
  about what 
  that you don t love me 
when i know at least
in some way you do 
  and how do you know that 
  portia 
i have done everything
inside and out 
  but that stuff doesn t matter to me 
  well  something matters 
 cause i d have to believe
if nothing mattered  you d love me   
and not some man
whose chin could sink the titanic 
  what  see  it s true  isn t it 
i m sorry 
does he light you up like this 
does he make you laugh 
nobody makes me laugh
like this 
good  then admit it 
admit that you love me 
  give me one kiss 
  oh  god 
that s all  one quick kiss 
just one kiss   
could not jeopardize
a glorious marriage 
besides  it would also explain
to me why your pulse jumped
from 66 to 1 02 beats per minute 
your respiration rate has doubled 
you re putting out clouds of pheromones 
  it s not fair to read me like that 
  i know  love isn t fair 
i m reading your heart 
i m asking you to follow it 
begging you 
begging is supposed to be humiliating 
i don t care 
i love you  portia 
i loved you the very first
moment i saw you 
  i thought you said a quick kiss 
  i lied 
how do you feel 
  wonderful 
  so do l 
i guess that s the point 
  what was that 
  that s your stomach growling 
you re hungry 
  was that me 
  yes 
  i thought it was you 
  no  it wasn t me 
really  ooh  do you do that 
sometimes 
quieter than that 
  ah  i ll have to have rupert
make me a muffler 
mm hmm 
it s wonderful  it s wonderful 
the taste and the texture both 
you know  it s marvelous 
i know this will be my fourth helping 
but may i please have some more 
pig  very smart animal 
obviously not that smart
if it ends up as bacon 
i feel like i m eating my way
through the entire food chain 
thank you 
what 
what s wrong 
if we re together 
you and me 
we ll never be accepted 
because i m not human 
that will not do 
i will have to get started 
started with what 
the next step 
i love you 
wish me luck 
andrew martin  step forward  please 
so  mr  martin 
you would like us to pass a bill   
declaring you
a human being 
yes  specifically
the ability to marry   
 a fellow human being 
  i see 
we have to face
the undeniable fact   
that no matter how much
you may be like a human being 
you are not part
of the human gene pool 
you are outside of it entirely 
you are something else 
something artificial 
sir  what about all the real people
wading in the gene pool   
who have bodies
full of prosthetic devices 
many of which i have invented 
you yourself  sir 
have one of my kidneys  do you not 
are you not in some way artificial 
at least in part 
in part  yes 
well  then 
i m human in part 
which part  andrew 
this one  sir 
i see  and here 
it is true i am still equipped
with a positronic brain 
and because of that
positronic brain 
you are 
for all accounts  immortal 
yes  sir 
well  andrew  society can tolerate
an immortal robot 
but we will never tolerate
an immortal human 
it arouses
too much jealousy 
too much anger 
i m sorry  andrew 
this court cannot and will not
validate your humanity 
i hereby bring an end
to these proceedings 
it is the decision
of this court   
that andrew martin
from this day forward   
will continue
to be declared a robot 
a mechanical machine 
nothing more 
one is glad to be of service 
andrew  i have to tell you   
andrew  i have to tell you   
i m beginning to feel
not so sure 
i m beginning to feel
not so sure 
  about us 
  no 
  next week will be my 75th birthday 
  i know  and you look 50 
  thank you 
  a spectacular 50 
  but i don t feel 50 
  your body does 
last night was amazing 
what was that called again 
  shut up and listen to me 
  sorry 
  and don t give me that look 
i m not ordering you around 
  whatever you say 
  please don t be agreeable 
  i m not being agreeable 
i can be if you want 
oh  goddamn it  andrew 
i m trying to tell you
something important here 
i m not going
to live forever 
yes  you will 
that s why i invented 
no  no  i won t always take
your d n a  elixirs 
i won t have
all my organs replaced 
eventually i m going
to wear out 
  and i want to 
  why would you want to leave 
there s an   
order to things 
human beings are meant to be here
for a certain time and then pass on 
that s what s right 
i see 
  there s just one problem  portia 
  what 
i couldn t stand
to live without you 
andrew  people grow
through time 
but then  of course  for you time
is a completely different proposition 
for you 
time is endless 
there s only one thing to do 
galatea  my dear 
where are we 
the transfusion
is almost complete 
is that so 
just goes to show you 
andrew 
somebody becomes
a human being 
sooner or later 
they do something monumentally stupid 
you ve been
a great example  rupert 
how quickly will the blood
degrade my system 
oh  i don t know 
you exercise  eat right 
i d say 30  40 years 
that s a little vague  chief 
you don t know exactly
how long i ll last 
sorry 
welcome to
the human condition 
andrew martin 
i have always tried
to make sense of things 
there must be some reason
i am as i am 
as you can see 
madam chairman 
i am no longer immortal 
you have arranged
to die 
in a sense  i have 
i am growing old 
and my body is deteriorating 
and  like all of you 
it will eventually cease
to function 
as a robot 
i could ve lived forever 
but i tell you all today 
i would rather die a man   
than live for all eternity
as a machine 
why do you want this 
to be acknowledged   
for who and what i am 
no more  no less 
not for acclaim 
not for approval 
the simple truth
of that recognition 
this has been the elemental drive
of my existence 
and it must be achieved 
if i am to live or die   
with dignity 
mr  martin 
what you are
asking for is   
extremely complex
and controversial 
it will not be
an easy decision 
i must ask
for your patience   
while i take the necessary time
to make a determination   
of this extremely
delicate matter 
i await your decision 
madam chairman 
thank you
for your patience 
we tried 
is it almost time 
in a few minutes 
it doesn t matter
what the world congress says 
why do you need
their approval 
old habit 
i started my existence
as a robot 
i still like to be told
certain things 
it s time 
ladies and gentlemen 
ms  marjorie bota 
president
of the world congress 
according to records
of the northam robotics company 
the robot 
also known as andrew martin 
was powered up at 5 15 p m  
on april 3  2005 
in a few hours 
he will be 200 years old 
which means that 
with the exception of methuselah
and other biblical figures 
andrew is the oldest living
human being in recorded history 
for it is
by this proclamation   
that i validate his marriage
to portia charney   
and acknowledge his humanity 
andrew 
i m sorry
he didn t see it 
maybe he didn t need to 
could you do me a favor 
would you mind
unplugging me 
that s an order 
thank you  galatea 
as the great andrew martin
used to say 
 one is glad to be of service  
i ll see you soon 
laugh and cry
laugh and cry
live and die
live and die
life is a dream
life is a dream
we all dream it
we all dream it
day by day
day by day
i find my way
i find my way
look for the soul

and the meaning

then you look at me
