to pick up her son nicky

i m sorry 
we re all really worried

to help the police
track her down

her as well as i thought i did 
it s like my mom used to say 
god rest her soul  um 
 secrets are like margarine 
 easy to spread 
bad for the heart  
but as different as we are 
i do consider emily
my best friend

elegant person

brought us together  actually 
well  you know 
for our new friends

from the beginning 
i met emily
a few weeks ago at school

meatless meatballs

a quarter in for every bad word 
you should smash
the  oopsy  jar 
  it might change your life 
  yeah  ugh  sorry

i think it s probably just
an excuse to avoid writing 
  your husband s a writer 
  no 
he wrote a book 10 years ago 
it made him
the toast of the town 
i actually had to stalk him to
make him fall in love with me 
but then nothing  he never
wrote anything ever again 
  it s the old bait and switch 
  what was the book 
it s called
 darkness at dawn  
oh  my gosh  i read that
in my book club 
  really 
  this was    yeah 
this was back when
i first became a single mom 
i joined this book club and
that was the first book we read 
it s    oh  it s so impressive 
so you re divorced  then 
widowed 
do you mind if i ask
how he died 
car accident 
  oh  how awful 
  yeah 
my brother chris was in
the passenger seat  so   
you re kidding 
one fell swoop  and the two
most important men
in my life were gone 
normally  sad stories
don t get to me 
but that one    that one did 
that was brutal 
i don t talk about it a lot 
especially with people
i just met 
i m really sorry 
oh  mmm   
baby  if you
apologize again 
i m gonna have to slap
the sorry out of you 
yeah  that s   
i m not sorry 
that s a hard habit
to break  though 
it is 
so  are you dating anyone 
no  slim pickings in warfield 
well  you are an hour
and a half outside the city 
i m not gonna date someone
from the city

and then that
mother of three wound up
with her head
in the trash can 
you remember that 
and i    ugh

struggling to make ends meet 
i mean  my husband
had life insurance 
thank goodness  but not a lot 
i put half of that away
for miles  college 
and so  with that coming in 
the money still

yeah  she has
a very high profile job

that she oversees 
most times when a woman
vanishes  she has a reason 
what are you implying 
exactly 
you two didn t have a fight 
something to make you
run off to london 
are you saying that
i broke my mother s hip 
you leave town 
your wife takes off

he is a dedicated
husband and father 
i have seen him with his wife

they ve got more chemistry
than a science fair 
just exploring
all avenues  ma am 
well  that avenue is
a dead end  so you can drop it 
and where s emily s family 
she doesn t have any 
she was an only child 
and her mother and father died
when she was a teenager 
i m sorry 
i didn t know that

no  god  she adores nicky 
she wouldn t do that 
she is an enigma  my wife 
that s what drew me to her 
it can also make her impossible 
she can be so fiercely private 
she sure doesn t
like having
her picture taken 
i ll tell you that 
i remember this one time 
she shut down my facebook
because i posted up
a family picture 
ugh  social media
is so tricky 
you can get close to her 
but you can never
quite reach her 
she s like a beautiful ghost 
never entirely there 
that s so poetic 
you know  that s why
you re such a good writer 
i m not a writer
anymore  stephanie 
i gave all that up just to chase
this woman
for the rest of my life 
i should order a taxi
and go home 
yeah 
oh  gosh  it s 1 25 
they stop driving at 1 00 here 
that couch pulls out  um 
if you wanna stay over 
i know nicky would love it
if you were here
in the morning 
that would be lovely 
who wants
more b vitamins 
  yeah

yeah 
are they nice 
  yeah 
  yeah  delicious 
  hi 
  hey 
uh  what on earth
are you making 
these are
hangover smoothies 
they get it
right out of you 
and the kids love them 
a little tip  
they have a full portion
of vegetables in them
and they don t even know it 
it s so hard to get kids
to eat their vegetables 
right 
mmm 
wanna try some 
great 
good 
i think we should
get ready for school 
oh  school  school 
hi  moms  stephanie here 
today i m making
a new recipe i learned
for a hangover smoothie 
uh  it s really nice 
i especially want to thank
everybody who s written in
to ask about emily 
it s been four days now 
so   
the good news is that sean
is home from london 
and he s working
very closely with the police 
um  actually  moms 
i know a lot of you
are hung up on the idea
that the husband
is always the primary suspect 
i know  i ve seen  law   order  
but  um   
first  i m here to tell you
sean was in london
when emily disappeared 
and some of you
have suggested
that he did that
to set up an alibi 
but he s an amazing husband
and an amazing father  so   
the police
haven t been much help 
but every mom knows if
you want something done right 
you have to do it yourself 
i will leave
no stone unturned 
i think that s
what emily would want

hermes scarf

to hang yourself with it 
look at that knot 
jesus fucking christ 
i m here about
emily nelson 
what about emily 
what happened 
she asked me to pick up
her son four days ago
because she went to miami 
she s still not back 
no texts  no calls 
no one in your office
seems to give a crap 
excuse my language 
  kiko 
  hmm 
why did emily
go to miami 
i didn t know she did 
we in this office
have learned that
when emily elects
not to tell us something 
it s best not to ask 
doesn t she work for you 
emily s job
is to stop the apocalypse
without worrying
any of the designers 
and she always
finds a way
to look fabulous
when she does it 
that s great 
what do you suggest
that i do 
never wear a vintage hermes
scarf with a gap t shirt 
if you were truly emily s
friend  you would know that 
excuse me 
i have a very busy day 
valerie  my office  now 
hi 
sit  sit  sit 
emily   i want answers  speak 
steven 
you forgot the shirts 
no  i can t
help you with that 
of course
he s freaking out 
he needs someone
to manage this now 
i don t know 
mother fudger 
well  if it isn t aunt frieda s
least favorite niece 
what were you
doing up there 
corporate spying or just
a common garden shoplifter 
yeah  you gotta go
right at them 
especially the powerful ones
or they will fuck you
in the face 
listen  you bargain basement
tom ford 
if you don t have this ken doll
unhand me this second 
i will tell the thousands of
moms that watch my vlog
that dennis nylon is a bully
who victimizes women
and that they should stop
buying your tacky blouses
made by indonesian children
because if you lose moms 
you lose business 
okay  number one  they are
not indonesian children 
they are vietnamese
teenagers 
number two 
tom ford wishes he were me 
and number three 
if i m tacky 
okay  you re   
this has been fun 
better pray
i don t have a bruise 
no wonder she doesn t like
having her picture taken 
look
at our little stephanie 
comforting
the worried husband 
oh  please  it s an arts
and crafts project 
i ve never seen her pass up
a chance to use a stapler 
emily s gonna hate those flyers
when she gets back 
she s not coming back 
don t you watch  dateline  
if the case isn t solved
in the first 72 hours 
they re always dead 
oh  yeah 
oh  perfect timing 
dinner s ready 
the boys are upstairs 
i m just gonna have them wash
their hands and come down 
  um   
  are you okay 
i ve just never
experienced anything like this 
walking into
a fully set dinner table 
yeah   
this is weird 
  i m being   
  no  no  no  not at all 
i think anything
stable these days
is like a gift
from heaven  right 
i should tidy up
first  though 
  oh  hey 
  hello 
  mr  townsend 
  ah  yes 
detective summerville 
we spoke on the phone 
that s right  um   
stephanie  can you help
the boys with their homework 
of course 
  come in  sorry 
  thank you 
just a pre dinner snack 
  that s a cute nanny 
  no  no 
that s one
of my wife s friends 
she s been helping me out 
oh  shit  can she come
help out around my house too 
the passenger manifest says
she wasn t on
any flights to miami 
but she did rent
a white kia from budget 
she paid in cash
for a two day rental 
now  when people
pay in cash 
that usually means one thing 
what are you saying 
she s having an affair 
i can t say that
with any confidence 
can you
not track the kia 
i have
toll booth reports coming in
from across the country 
assuming she s not
swapping out plates 
i wanna get a description
of your wife
to every precinct
in the tri state area  okay 
did she have
any distinguishing features 
any birthmarks  tattoos 
she s got a tattoo
on her left wrist 
oh  great 
it s flames and a charity
symbol in the middle 
really 
  more judgment from you 
  nope  no  no  no 
but she did
things like that 
impulsive  crazy things 
i m gonna go call this in 
tell your wife s friend
i said goodbye 
you re a saint 
you don t have to do that 
i m not a saint  i just like
to keep my hands busy 
um    i should go 
it s flags of the world day
on monday 
i haven t even started
on south america 
sorry 
no  i don t mean sorry 
i mean thank you 
thank you for being
such a good friend 
of course 
i m a problem solver 
i just wish i could do more 
you re doing plenty 
so  that s where
we are today 
and we are keeping
our heads up
and not jumping
to any conclusions 
we are soldiering on
with cookies and origami 
but for you moms
who want to help 
we know that emily
was driving a white kia
that she rented
from a budget
at la guardia airport
on the 24th 
and i did a little digging 
so  um 
the license plate is   
dear stephanie  i m
writing from standish  michigan 
with a possible
emily sighting 
i was driving down i 75
two days ago 
when i saw a woman
gassing up a white kia 
she was really pretty
and i remember thinking
she didn t look like
she was from around here 
i hope this help   
so  um 
summerville sent the info
to the local authorities
in michigan 
did she ever mention michigan 
did she have a friend there 
as far as i knew  she didn t
have any real friends 
  not before you 
  oh 
i    how is that possible 
hold on 
hello  please
tell me you found her 
a lake 
well  i don t know 
okay  i m heading
there now 
they found the rental car
in michigan 
look  i m gonna have to go
 cause otherwise
i m going to go crazy 
  can you do me a favor 
  yes  it s done  go 
hi  moms  stephanie here 
i can see we have
a flood of new viewers today 
and if you re new
to the vlog  i m sorry 
this probably isn t
the best entry to start with 
for those of you who have been
following my vlog this week 
you know that my best friend
emily went missing 
and so many of you wrote in with
your helpful tips and ideas 
and i wanna give a special
thanks to leanne lippens
whose helpful tip made
a major break in the case 
i have some somber news 
emily was found 
not alive  i m afraid 
my friend emily nelson   
   is dead 
our father 
we look to you again 
facing this moment
of our need 
in our sorrow 
grief and loneliness
draw us up to yourself 
that we may know the comfort
of the everlasting arms 
especially support
and comfort those
who have been closest
to our departed sister 
sustain them
in the blessed assurance
that death is conquered
and new life is begun 
to be absent from the body
is to be present
with the lord 
may we be assured
in the hope
that we shall
walk together again
in your blessed presence 
help us to number our days
that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom 
in the name of the father 
and of the son 
and of the holy spirit 
amen 
  hi

last minute brownie entry

you watch my vlog 
i mean  to be honest  when
we first started watching it 
we were just
making fun of you

really helpful hints in there

her family out like this

you can act out
all you want  that s fine 
this doesn t change
what i know 
  what do you know 
  that you re a good kid 
so let s just sit here
and not talk 
let s just sit here and   
   and feel lousy
and watch the grass grow 
hey 
hey  come on

this is the kind of stuff
nobody gets right

  yeah  um   
i ll come right down 
shit 
  hi  hi 
  hey  hey

i had a key  cause earlier
sean gave me a key   
you re not under arrest 
miss smothers 
  whoa 
  fyi 
i should hope not  oh 
  all right  no  no 
  no 
  you re very funny 
  yeah  yeah  yeah 
um   
sean s not here right now 
you know  i was actually
hoping to speak to you 
  oh 
  yeah  i went by your house 
then i went by the school 
then one of the moms
thought you might be here 
did they  okay 
well  that s   
was it stacy 
can i come in 
  of course  i would love that 
  thank you 
entrez vous 
you said that emily s
your best friend 
yes  yes  we are 
  was she depressed 
  no 
no  she had everything 
she had the house
and the job   
and the husband 
i was getting there  yeah 
the neighbors said
they fought a lot 
well  they had issues  um   
but they loved
each other intensely 
oh  what issues
did they have 
the normal issues  they were
stressed about money 
and i think emily wanted
to slow down
and smell the roses 
she slowed down all right 
i got the autopsy report
right here 
let s see here 
 severe liver damage
suggesting heavy alcohol use 
 track marks along her arms
and between her toes  
i mean  were you aware
of the heroin use 
no  that s  uh   
i m sorry  i really
have trouble believing that 
i mean   
she liked a very
strong martini  but   
i don t know how she could ve
kept that a secret from me 
and especially
from her husband  sean 
yeah  you seem
to know sean pretty well 
i    we ve gotten
to know each other
over the last few weeks 
just as friends 
uh huh 
i m guessing
you ve never dealt
with law enforcement before 
  not really  no 
  mmm 
that s a really nice dress 
oh  thank you 
doesn t seem to be
your style  though 
oh  i m very versatile 
detective 
i think you ll find 
i m really just trying
to help sean and nicky
in their time of grief 
oh  how is sean s grief 
he s    he is holding up
very well 
as well as can be expected 
uh huh 
is that everything  or   
let me ask you something 
were you aware
that he took out
an extra  4 million
life insurance policy
on emily before
she disappeared 
i was not aware of that  no 
i    why  how would i 
okay  all right 
yeah  i don t   
i m sorry  what did   
what are you    are you saying
he had her rubbed out 
he hired a hitman 
i didn t say anything
about him hiring a hitman 
you just did 
okay  i can see
that you re enjoying yourself 
detective summerville 
but if you wanna
grill someone  you should
really speak to emily s
boss  dennis nylon 
he could not be
more suspicious 
that s super interesting
because he contacted us
and he said he thought you knew
more than you were letting on 
well  he    he sucks 
so   
as long as you re honest
with me  ms  smothers 
i swear to you  you have
nothing to worry about  okay 
i m just following breadcrumbs
wherever they lead 
okay  you know what 
i m done for now 
thanks for your time 
your theory
doesn t hold water  you know 
because it doesn t explain
the fake plane ticket
or the rental car 
and why would someone
shoot her full of heroin
at a summer camp in michigan 
there s plenty of good heroin
right here in connecticut 
i m told 
great  good  okay 
so we have a lot to talk about 
all right  then 
enjoy the new house 
the worst breadcrumbs
i ve ever heard of  you know 
couldn t fill a caesar salad
with those breadcrumbs 
ohh  ugh 
why is this
caesarean salad so crunchy 
it s caesar salad  baby 
and it s delicious 
what s in it 
  breadcrumbs 
  oh 
how was your day at work 
grim 
spent most of the day
explaining the difference
between  your  possessive
and  you re  apostrophe r e
to college juniors 
i can see how that might
drive a man over the edge 
i know  right 
what about you boys 
what d you guys get up to
today at school 
i saw my mom 
um   
i understand  nicky 
that sometimes
we think we see people
that we miss
even if they re gone 
no  i saw her 
she was right outside
the fence
by the kickball yard
at recess 
well  lots of people
look like someone else 
nobody looks like mom 
she told me
to say hi to stephanie 
nicky  this is unhealthy 
miles saw her too 
right  miles 
i think i did 
but i don t know 
i was playing tetherball 
did you two hatch this up 
is this a game  like when you
smash everything with trucks 
because you know
what we say about lying 
i m not lying 
i saw her  fuck you 
  hey  nicky 
  oopsy 
i m sorry 
don t i get a kiss
good night 
of course you do  sweetie 
actually  you owe
the oopsy jar a quarter
for earlier  but i   
good night  sweetie 
hey 
we should get naked 
what is it 
what s wrong 
i smell her  sean 
i smell her perfume 
it s all over nicky
like a ghost 
he probably got
to her perfume bottle
in the medicine cabinet 
he misses her 
okay  it s just you
being paranoid 
is it  because
i found this too 
what s this 
it s the friendship
bracelet i made her 
i m afraid to say
she would not have kept this 
she hated stuff like this 
she probably gave it to him
right after you gave it to her 
unless he s telling the truth 
you saw her
with your own eyes 
in her coffin 
there was something off 
they found her
at the bottom of a lake 
you saw her tattoo 
and you saw that ring
that she stole from my mother 
she said your mother
wanted her to have that ring 
she said your
mother insisted 
that s what she told you 
my father gave that ring
to my mother 
it was like the only bit of
jewelry that she ever owned 
i took emily to london to meet
my mother after we eloped 
it went missing that weekend 
my mother was frantic 
we searched everywhere 
nothing  we didn t
find a single thing 
my mother was devastated 
so we took our flight
back to new york 
guess what i found 
what did you find 
no 
no way 
my little sherlock holmes 
mum is gonna
be so relieved 
oh  come on  baby 
your mom will take it
to the grave  what a waste 
it s so pretty 
excuse me 
not amusing  my darling 
not in the slightest 
i m not joking
in the slightest   
   my darling 
i took it  i don t have any
intention of giving it back 
of course
we re gonna give it back 
no 
we ll tell her it just slipped
into your purse by accident 
and we ve only
found it now 
but if you tell her
that i found it 
then i have to tell her
that i stole it 
and what do you think
will be worse for her 
thinking that
she lost her ring 
or thinking that her son
married a thief 
  baby   
  hey 
you choose  her or me 
meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds 
knock twice 
nine months later 
nicky was born 
how could you stay with her 
i was spellbound 
she was the only woman
i could never figure out fully 
and as a young 
arrogant writer 
i could never live up
to what she expected of me 
i was always
looking over my shoulder 
i could hardly sleep 
but with you  it s different 
i sleep like a log 
that s what every woman
wants to hear 
you know what i mean 
you understand me 
you see me 
you ve rebuilt me 
stephanie 
i ve even started
writing again 
first couple of chapters 
but it s a start 
oh 
that s wonderful 
you took a broken man
and you pieced him
back together again 
you re unlike any other
woman i ve ever met 
move in with me 
sean 
no  it s too soon 
what will people think 
they re already thinking it 
and i m tired of lying 
i m tired of pretending 
i want to be this man 
the man i am with you 
i don t do threesomes 
i want to say that  i ll just
get that out in the open 
what are you talking about 
your ta 
emily told me
about your little moment 
  that s what she told you 
  yes 
stephanie  listen 
emily was a pathological liar 
that never happened  okay 
why did you take out
a  4 million
insurance policy on her 
my gosh  those cops really did
a number on you  didn t they 
  i m being serious 
  it was because of you 
when emily found out
that you had been
living off your husband s
insurance money 
she thought she and i
needed to get policies
out for nicky s sake 
it s probably the most
responsible thing we ever did 
thanks to you 
move in with me 
we can start a whole new 
wonderful life together 
just you  me and the boys 
please  say yes 
i love you 
stephanie smothers 
i love you too 
hmm   
hi  moms  stephanie here 
i m gonna do something
a little different today

of religion on the vlog 
i don t wanna offend any
non denominational moms 
but i do think that we live on
after we die  so   
emily  if you are out there 
and you can hear me
right now 
no one could ever replace you 
and you ll always be
nicky s mom 
i can t take your place 
i can just try to love
the people that you love
and try to make
their lives better

you would want 
  i think i ll go
for a walk outside now

some unfortunate news  um   
emily s dead 
my condolences 
who the fuck is emily 
the girl in the painting 
good  her name s not emily 
her name s claudia 
rest in peace  asshole 
so  not a pleasant memory
for you  then 
no  opposite 
she was amazing 
i mean  she was the best
that i ever had 
i was selling paintings 
you know 
it was the first time
in my career
that i had any buzz 
she walked
into my gallery 
a real fucking muse
just right out of thin air 
  what happened 
  she was all i could paint 
i memorized
every inch of her body 
my dealer fucking hated it 
and the art critics
fucking hated it 
they called me a knockoff 
a dyke mapplethorpe 
anyway  i blew my whole career
painting that con artist 
now all i paint
are these goddamn knives 
which are pretty good  but
nobody wants to buy this shit 
oh  what  they re so good 
people are just jealous 
i haven t had a drink
in 42 days 
  oh  don t   
  might as well celebrate 
mmm  well  cheers 
i gave her my heart
and i gave her my soul 
i paid for her
to go to college 
i paid off her debts 
did you ever
see any heroin use 
no  no way  her 
no  she didn t touch it 
shit 
she never let me paint
her face except for this one 
i ve never seen
such a beautiful girl
want to be so invisible
or just completely vanish 
but you know what 
it takes money to vanish 
and so she took everything
that she could from me 
you know
how i would paint you 
beatific 
like    like a fucking saint 
i get that a lot 
you should embrace it 
people love saints 
yeah  after they re dead 
okay  what do you know
about her  how did she die 
in a lake 
on heroin 
well  you don t believe that
or you wouldn t be here 
she didn t ever mention
michigan  did she 
huh 
that is the only thing
that she ever left here 
she said she had it
since she was a kid 
i warn you  you go
poking around in her past 
you re gonna find
some shit that is terrifying 
she was not a normal person
like you or me 
sean  it s stephanie   
i thought about
what you said 
and you re right 
these are just stages of grief 
this experience has been
so stressful for both of us 
i m gonna take
a couple of days to myself 
i ll have sona pick up the boys 
and they can stay
at her house tonight 
you should take
some time too 
there s ham stew
in the freezer 
five minutes in the microwave 
lots of love 
yeah 
we ve been saving young souls
going on 50 years now

practically a porpoise 
so i know he s gonna love
swimming in that pond 
oh  that s squaw lake

to feed a multitude 
oh  oh  that s so funny

to find closure
surrounding the death
of my best friend

where she drowned
to see if i could   
   dredge something up 
oh  shit 
well  it turns out
this is the site
of many a canoe race at
the squaw lake bible camp 
i had to dig through
a bunch of camp journals 
and i found a photo of emily 
whose middle name is claudia 
not pretty  i didn t know that 
you crazy fucking bitch 
it s like looking at
an angel  isn t it  moms 
brotherfucker 
and it gave me
the closure i needed 
i feel closer to emily

you re listening 
and you gotta have faith 
brotherfucker

my boss  sean townsend 
about his wife 
emily nelson s policy

can you tell me the name
of the agent
who handles
that account  please 
dear miss prager 
my name is bruce hargrave 
i m writing to you about
a case you re handling
for emily nelson 
recently deceased 
i have been the caretaker
of her family estate
for many years 
what i have to say
will sound crazy 
but years ago  my employer
died in a house fire 
his teen daughters 
hope and faith mclanden 
disappeared without a trace 
i m attaching an old photo   
hi  this is sean townsend 
i was meant to meet
billy kent for lunch 
what do you mean 
you guys called two days ago
to organize this 
no  never mind 
i ll call him back 
boo 
oh  come on  you dumb shit 
we ve spent
every anniversary here 
how could you not
put it together 
  emily  why 
  i have 4 million reasons why 
  how could you do this to nicky 
  i did this for nicky 
i hated that job 
i never got to see him 
it s not like we could
live off your faculty buffet
the rest of our lives 
could we 
i grieved your death 
i understand 
you re not alone 
they say that 90  of people
who lose their spouse
end up sleeping with
their spouse s best friend
after their funeral  actually 
really 
no  i just made that up 
you fucking dick 
that s how you grieve 
balls deep
in my best friend 
you could ve
told me something 
except you can t keep
a secret  even in the dark 
  anything 
  you almost ruined everything 
i had to lay low until the
insurance money came through 
and so why didn t
you stay low  hmm 
  instead you terrorized our son 
  i didn t terrorize him 
you made me think
that he had gone insane
as well as stephanie 
i missed him too much 
he s my little dude 
you know how much
i love that kid 
well  the clock is ticking now 
nancy drew knows too much 
if she fucks up my insurance
money coming through 
i m taking you
down with me 
you re taking me
down with you 
well  of course 
this was all your plan 
my plan 
i had nothing to do with it   
why are you
playing dumb now 
   you twisted fucking psycho 
i don t know where   
what were you saying about
me being a fucking psycho 
  do you love her 
  no  it was just sex 
did you think of me
when you were fucking her 
yes 
do you love me or not  baby 
of course i do 
she doesn t mean
a thing to me 
good 
  fuck 
  oh  oh  shit 
i forgot to load it 
fuck  oh  god 
can you imagine
if i would have  though 
  what a mess 
  emily  you re crazy 
hey  it s pretty simple 
you know 
it s your choice 
her or me 
it s not that hard 
hey  stop it 
you love this 
meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds 
knock twice 
there he is now 
mr  townsend  isabel prager 
addison first insurance 
i m investigating
the death benefit claim
for your late wife 
sean 
did you know that
emily had a twin 
no  but   
well  i hate
to even say this 
but it means the body in
the lake could be this sister 
it could explain
the dna match 
and if that s the case 
then where is emily 
if my wife was still alive 
she d come home 
she d wanna see her son 
i m not a cop  and i m
definitely no therapist 
i m just an insurance guy 
but this is an incredibly
interesting case 
  this is just bananas  isn t it 
  yeah 
i will say 
it s unusual
to live with someone
as husband and wife
and not know
that they have a twin 
well  she was a very
private person 
well  hey 
we all have our secrets 
but  as i m sure
you can understand 
with a payment of this size 
we ll have to continue
this claims investigation 
of course 
and  by law  give all our
findings to the authorities 
of course 
anything you need 
i just hope that my wife
is still alive 
i want her back 
okey dokey  then 
obviously  if you
do hear from her   
  you ll be the first to know 
  thank you so much 
okay  thank you 
thanks for the coffee 
  bye  thank you so much again 
  thanks  yeah 
you knew that she had a twin 
did i  why didn t you 
you knew
and you didn t tell me 
sean 
you sound crazy 
i   
take a xanax 
take two 
hi  moms  stephanie here 
today  we re talking about
tombstone tributes 
i want to thank helen
from missoula  montana 
for the suggestions 
for thinking outside the box 
you know  it doesn t have
to just be flowers anymore 
i think any item that
sparks a fond memory is perfect 
and emily s favorite treat
was a dry gin martini
in the late afternoon 
i m gonna make a couple
just like emily used to 
frozen gin  frozen glass 
generous twist 
i m gonna head out there
a little later today 
have a toast on her grave 
nice big twist 
i taught you well 
student s become
the master 
ooh  wisdom 
hey  give me that 
i don t know
what tricks you have
up those new
sleeves of yours 
you think
i poisoned both drinks 
that s not my style 
i don t even eat gluten 
  want another 
  please 
first  tell me why you killed
your father and sister 
okay  why don t we first talk
about your son s real father 
oh  emily 
i hold all the cards here 
i wanna know
about your twin  faith 
  i m not a twin 
  great  i know that you are 
we were triplets 
faith  hope  and charity 
charity was stillborn 
mom thought
we offed her in the womb 
  hmm 
  dad believed her 
she s quite a woman 
your mother 
i had a nice afternoon
with mags 
you met my mother 
she likes her martinis
even stronger than yours 
we had a little walk
down memory lane 
she s a cold woman  em 
bet you couldn t do
anything right in her eyes 
it was probably
faith s idea to set the fire 
but then all the bad ideas
were faith s  weren t they 
  you don t know anything 
  sure i do 
and i get it 
you re 16 
it s that age
where you feel so trapped 
and if your mother always
had the biting comment   
  faith  it s over  let s go 
  dad  dad 
  dad  don t touch me 
  it s not my fault 
   i m guessing your father
was more direct 
mr  mclanden  whore 
  never again 
  stop 
that s when you and faith
learned to hit
the reset button  right 
burn  baby  burn 
why d you leave each other 
well  we couldn t stay
together after the fire 
the cops were looking for
the big blonde arson twins 
we were a walking sideshow 
fuck off 
we    we had to say goodbye 
so we did it with tattoos  
flames and a little
something for charity 
we split up
in corpus christi 
she was gonna head south to
mexico  i was gonna go north 
we set a time
and place to meet
after the smoke cleared 
but then
she never showed up 
i was worried sick 
i waited for days 
but nothing 
you know  i thought
maybe this was
my opportunity
to do it on my own 
she was always
getting me into trouble 
so i bought a one way ticket to
new york and never looked back 
  did you miss her 
  of course i missed her 
i wasn t whole without her 
but i couldn t go on like that 
  i had to survive 
  and it worked 
yeah  my life in new york
fell into place 
i got a job 
worked my way up 
i met the perfect man 
oh  you know
that part  though 
  and then your sister calls 
  fucking facebook 
  you had to see her 
  yeah  of course i did 
so you fabricate
this trip to miami 
meet up at the old camp 
camp bunk four 
it was our happy place 
it was the only place we could
escape our dad  really 
it must have been shocking
to see her
after all those years 
yeah  it was like
looking in the mirror   
   except at the sick life
she chose over me 
  what did she want 
  everything 
you just gonna stand there 
you gotta have faith 
i don t hear from you
for 14 years 
and now here you are 
  i m out of cash 
  shocking 
the fuck did you say 
nothing  i just   
get away with it this time 
okay  so  um    now what 
i don t know 
i didn t know where to go 
when i call 
you act like a stranger 
won t even let me
come meet your family 
what am i supposed
to say to them 
the truth 
well  you may as well now
 cause i m about
to tell the cops 
  you re what 
  i don t know what else to do 
i mean  i don t have anything 
so i don t really have
anything to lose 
i m gonna go tell them
everything we did
and then  you know 
we ll go down together 
we can be together again 
i have a little boy now 
yeah  i know  i saw that kid 
he s super cute 
cut the shit  okay 
what do you want from me 
i want a million bucks 
how am i supposed
to give you that 
you re rich and famous now 
i can t give you
a million dollars 
you do seem
highly motivated 
i don t know what it is  though 
i don t think it s your job 
probably  um   
probably your kid 
don t talk about nicky 
yeah  i ll  um   
i ll sell the house 
i ll do whatever i need to do 
if i do this 
you can t tell anyone ever 
  do you understand 
  yeah  yeah  i get it 
i mean  i don t really get
the big deal  though 
 cause you and me could always
just make another kid 
you know that  right 
you can t make
another sister  though 
oh  it s fucking hot 
come on 
let s go swimming 
remember 
like we used to 
  you coming 
  yeah 
right behind you 
how d you
get her in the lake 
fuck you 
i didn t kill my sister 
that was her idea 
come on  wimp 
what  i thought
you were the alpha now 
no 
i am the alpha 
god damn it 
you abandoned me 
we were supposed
to be a team  you and me 
  remember 
  yeah  i know we were 
but i just thought
the only chance
we had was alone  so   
you were right 
i m sorry  kid 
me too 
i was so worried 
i woke up the next morning
and i couldn t
find her anywhere 
i never thought   
   i never thought
she d do that  you know 
when i found her body
in the lake  it was too late 
lie  you drowned her 
no  she killed herself 
i m just all that s left of her 
  no  you re a sister killer 
  you re a brotherfucker 
ooh 
what does sean know 
everything 
it was his idea 
i didn t know what to do
once i found the body
and he said   you know 
maybe this is our opportunity 
 we could finally
get out of debt 
 flee the country 
 spend more time with nicky  
he convinced me
we could pull it off 
you know  that her dna
would do the rest 
i don t believe you 
he grieved for you 
oh  you believed that 
aw  that was all an act 
you re a pathological liar 
did sean say that 
cool 
i m just gonna play you
this tune real quick 
  do you love her 
  no

did you think of me
when you were fucking her 
yes

stephanie

mommy and daddy time

thank you 
oh  please  sean 
i m not gonna poison you 
if i wanted to get rid of you 
you d already be dead 
you put those files
on my computer 
yes  i did 
but i did have help
from a woman
who loves volunteering
for everything 
stephanie 
she s not as sweet
as her snatch  is she 
were you ever gonna tell me
you had a twin sister 
  wasn t your business 
  i m your husband 
you ve been fucking
my best friend in my house 
but now you re
my husband  okay 
then i should probably tell
you that we were triplets 
the details 
hi  moms 
stephanie here 
i wanna thank you for all
the love and support
you ve been sending me 
it means so much 
um   
you know  as shocked
as you guys are
about these turns of events 
i can assure you  nobody
is more stunned than me 
emily had her secrets 
so did her husband 
clearly  i was
the naive romantic
caught in the middle 
i love you guys  i always will 
i hope you can forgive me in
advance for what i have to do 
moms  do everything yourself 
stephanie 
you shouldn t be here right now 
i used to live here  remember 
  don t make this any hard   
  don t move 
stephanie  please 
you don t even let the boys
play with squirt guns 
that was before
you told me you loved me 
and it turned out you were
laughing at me behind my back 
stephanie  maybe we should
take it down a notch 
you used me 
you used me too 
but you had me
making you dinner 
watching your kid 
and sucking your dick 
i had no idea
that she was still alive 
  stop lying 
  okay  you guys 
i think we should just
sit down and talk this out 
emily  you sit down 
you hated stephanie 
you used to watch her vlog
and rip her apart 
all i wanted
was to be your friend 
you were 
and then you fucked my husband
and my insurance plan 
don t blame her 
this is so typical of you 
i was just trying to get us
out of crushing fucking debt 
yeah  maybe if you had the
good sense to give me a call 
i could ve helped you with
this little plot of yours 
please  you haven t come up
with a decent plot in 10 years 
really  right now 
can i say something 
as the lady with the gun 
nicky deserves better
than both of you 
  fuck you  i love my kid 
  shut up 
stephanie  put down the gun 
you don t wanna do this 
i really do  though 
i loved you 
i loved you too 
i think this is the best thing 
  whoa 
  we could say he attacked us 
  they ll believe us  you know 
  no  no  no 
you re not fucking serious 
you re not gonna kill him 
we re just gonna
send him to jail 
j    are you serious 
jail s enough for you 
  you don t need to kill him 
  aren t you angry 
don t you want revenge
for your sister 
yeah  yes  but he didn t
technically kill her 
then who did 
 cause i don t buy
that it was an accident 
screw this 
oh 
  oh  my god 
  oh  fuck 
oh  my god  jesus 
oh  my god  um   
oh  my god 
shit  is he really dead 
sean  i m sorry 
what do i do 
do you put pressure on it or   
do we call an ambulance 
do i just let him die 
i mean  he deserved it  right 
no  i killed her 
i killed my sister 
what  sean  sean 
get up 
show s over  come on 
seriously  come on 
get the fuck up  hey 
you too  brando 
  get up 
  fuck 
wow 
that was extra 
i mean  obviously  i knew you
guys were up to something
when i saw both the mics
that you had the cops
plant in here 
you clearly wanted
a confession out of me 
so you could clear
sean s name 
but that was    that was
a good way to go about it 
where you messed up 
though  baby girl 
is thinking
that i would confess
to protect that
fucking yeast infection 
  really 
  all right 
come on  you gotta know
better than that 
hmm 
but then you came in 
all emotional with the gun 
and that was   
that was convincing 
yeah  it was very cinematic 
i don t even know
where you find this shit 
you re really amazing 
  thanks  that means a lot 
  mmm 
but you did confess  emily 
oh  yeah 
um   
i did  but i cut
these first  though 
for our friendship bracelets 
one for you 
that is    disappointing 
oh  my god 
look what i found 
huh 
okay  you can t shoot us 
  the police are outside 
  no  they re not 
 hey  cops  stephanie here 
 change of plans 
 i m meeting emily and sean
at darren s house now 
 i ll see you there  
you sent them
to darren s house 
it s a virus 
string theory 
string theory  isn t it 
hands up  weapons down 
no  i have
a prescription for that 
i have ocular pressure 
i ve been on the run
for 10 years 
you think i don t know how
to manipulate the system 
so you re gonna kill us 
well  what the fuck else
am i supposed to do 
you two will clearly go
to extraordinary lengths
to take me down 
and you know too much 
so  i feel like
a murder suicide
is the only fitting end
for you two 
and if you kill him 
i think our insurance
still covers that  right 
i mean  it s sort of perfect 
one door closes and another
one opens  thank you for that 
you always have been
fucking crazy  haven t you 
have i 
ugh 
oh  shit  you re right 
god  you fucking   
you actually fucking shot me 
i m gonna miss him 
your turn 
emily  come on 
you re not gonna kill me 
oh  yeah  i killed
my dad and my sister 
but i could never kill my
husband fucking best friend 
am i really
your best friend 
you re not just saying
that for  you know   
no  no  i m not
just saying that at all 
i get worried that it s just me 
i know  sometimes
i was worried about that too 
it s so hard to connect
with other moms   
and then when you have
a full time job  it s   
okay  okay 
don t pull that crap 
being a mom is a full time job 
what i do is hard work 
and i have my vlog
on top of that 
and that s just getting
bigger and bigger 
if you came on the vlog 
that d be so fun 
if you came on the vlog
and confessed
to killing your father and
sister and held me at gunpoint 
i could probably hit
a million subscribers 
aww  that would ve been great 
  why don t we do that right now 
  hmm 
we re live streaming 
did you not know that 
what the fuck
are you talking about 
god  that s so rude 
i m sorry
