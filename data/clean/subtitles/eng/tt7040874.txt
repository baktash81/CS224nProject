it was a work crisis
yeah she has
a very highprofile job
and a full staff
that she oversees
most times when a woman
vanishes she has a reason
what are you implying
exactly
you two didnt have a fight
something to make you
run off to london
are you saying that
i broke my mothers hip
you leave town
your wife takes off
maybe theres um
a close friend she might
be spending some time with
excuse me thats very rude
he is a dedicated
husband and father
i have seen him with his wife
let me tell you
theyve got more chemistry
than a science fair
just exploring
all avenues maam
well that avenue is
a dead end so you can drop it
and wheres emilys family
she doesnt have any
she was an only child
and her mother and father died
when she was a teenager
im sorry
i didnt know that
well file
a missing persons report
and contact you
in the next couple of days
if she doesnt turn up
well contact the local
authorities in miami
not planning any more trips
are you mr townsend
no im gonna be right here
im gonna be at my house
with my son
we can show ourselves out
god knows weve had
our troubles in the past
but i dont think shed just
up and leave her child
no god she adores nicky
she wouldnt do that
she is an enigma my wife
thats what drew me to her
it can also make her impossible
she can be so fiercely private
she sure doesnt
like having
her picture taken
ill tell you that
i remember this one time
she shut down my facebook
because i posted up
a family picture
ugh social media
is so tricky
you can get close to her
but you can never
quite reach her
shes like a beautiful ghost
never entirely there
thats so poetic
you know thats why
youre such a good writer
im not a writer
anymore stephanie
i gave all that up just to chase
this woman
for the rest of my life
i should order a taxi
and go home
yeah
oh gosh its 125
they stop driving at 100 here
that couch pulls out um
if you wanna stay over
i know nicky would love it
if you were here

hi
hey
uh what on earth
are you making
these are
hangover smoothies
they get it
right out of you

get ready for school

hi moms stephanie here
today im making
a new recipe i learned
for a hangover smoothie
uh its really nice
i especially want to thank
everybody whos written in
to ask about emily
its been four days now
so
the good news is that sean
is home from london
and hes working
very closely with the police
um actually moms
i know a lot of you
are hung up on the idea
that the husband
is always the primary suspect
i know ive seen law  order
but um
first im here to tell you
sean was in london
when emily disappeared
and some of you
have suggested
that he did that
to set up an alibi
but hes an amazing husband
and an amazing father so
the police
havent been much help
but every mom knows if
you want something done right
you have to do it yourself
i will leave
no stone unturned
i think thats
what emily would want

emily nelson
what about emily
what happened
she asked me to pick up
her son four days ago
because she went to miami
shes still not back
no texts no calls
no one in your office
seems to give a crap
excuse my language
kiko
hmm
why did emily
go to miami
i didnt know she did
we in this office
have learned that
when emily elects
not to tell us something
its best not to ask
doesnt she work for you
emilys job
is to stop the apocalypse
without worrying
any of the designers
and she always
finds a way
to look fabulous
when she does it
thats great
what do you suggest
that i do
never wear a vintage hermes
scarf with a gap tshirt
if you were truly emilys
friend you would know that
excuse me
i have a very busy day
valerie my office now
hi
sit sit sit
emily  i want answers speak
steven

help you with that

mother fudger
well if it isnt aunt friedas
least favorite niece
what were you
doing up there
corporate spying or just
a common garden shoplifter
yeah you gotta go
right at them
especially the powerful ones
or they will fuck you
in the face
listen you bargain basement
tom ford
if you dont have this ken doll
unhand me this second
i will tell the thousands of
moms that watch my vlog
that dennis nylon is a bully
who victimizes women
and that they should stop
buying your tacky blouses
made by indonesian children
because if you lose moms
you lose business
okay number one they are
not indonesian children
they are vietnamese
teenagers
number two
tom ford wishes he were me
and number three
if im tacky
okay youre
this has been fun
better pray
i dont have a bruise
no wonder she doesnt like
having her picture taken
look
at our little stephanie
comforting
the worried husband
oh please its an arts
and crafts project
ive never seen her pass up
a chance to use a stapler
emilys gonna hate those flyers

the passenger manifest says
she wasnt on
any flights to miami
but she did rent
a white kia from budget
she paid in cash
for a twoday rental
now when people
pay in cash
that usually means one thing
what are you saying
shes having an affair
i cant say that
with any confidence
can you
not track the kia
i have
toll booth reports coming in
from across the country
assuming shes not
swapping out plates
i wanna get a description
of your wife
to every precinct
in the tristate area okay
did she have
any distinguishing features
any birthmarks tattoos
shes got a tattoo
on her left wrist
oh great
its flames and a charity
symbol in the middle

more judgment from you

things like that
impulsive crazy things

was driving a white kia
that she rented
from a budget
at la guardia airport

dear stephanie im
writing from standish michigan
with a possible
emily sighting
i was driving down i75
two days ago
when i saw a woman
gassing up a white kia
she was really pretty
and i remember thinking
she didnt look like
she was from around here
i hope this help

summerville sent the info
to the local authorities
in michigan

facing this moment
of our need
in our sorrow
grief and loneliness

of the everlasting arms

and comfort those
who have been closest
to our departed sister
sustain them
in the blessed assurance
that death is conquered
and new life is begun
to be absent from the body
is to be present
with the lord
may we be assured
in the hope
that we shall
walk together again
in your blessed presence
help us to number our days
that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom
in the name of the father
and of the son
and of the holy spirit

that everything
youre feeling right now
is normal
you can act out
all you want thats fine

what do you know
that youre a good kid
so lets just sit here
and not talk
lets just sit here and
and feel lousy
and watch the grass grow
hey
hey come on
dont be hard on yourself yeah
this is the kind of stuff
nobody gets right
you do you always do
no no come on
um
um i dont know if we
yeah
youre right we shouldnt
yeah
yeah

so dont forget me
come close
be under my skin
i can not wait
go under my skin
huh come on
are you serious
hey ms smothers
can i talk to you
yeah um
ill come right down
shit
hi hi
hey hey
uh i just left something
here so i was just
i had a key cause earlier
sean gave me a key
youre not under arrest
miss smothers
whoa
fyi
i should hope not oh
all right no no
no
youre very funny
yeah yeah yeah
um
seans not here right now
you know i was actually
hoping to speak to you
oh
yeah i went by your house
then i went by the school
then one of the moms
thought you might be here
did they okay
well thats
was it stacy
can i come in
of course i would love that
thank you
entrezvous
you said that emilys
your best friend
yes yes we are
was she depressed
no
no she had everything
she had the house
and the job
and the husband
i was getting there yeah
the neighbors said
they fought a lot
well they had issues um
but they loved
each other intensely
oh what issues
did they have
the normal issues they were
stressed about money
and i think emily wanted
to slow down
and smell the roses
she slowed down all right
i got the autopsy report
right here
lets see here
severe liver damage
suggesting heavy alcohol use
track marks along her arms
and between her toes
i mean were you aware
of the heroin use
no thats uh
im sorry i really
have trouble believing that
i mean
she liked a very
strong martini but
i dont know how she couldve
kept that a secret from me
and especially
from her husband sean
yeah you seem
to know sean pretty well
i weve gotten
to know each other
over the last few weeks
just as friends
uhhuh
im guessing
youve never dealt
with law enforcement before
not really no
mmm
thats a really nice dress
oh thank you
doesnt seem to be
your style though
oh im very versatile
detective
i think youll find
im really just trying
to help sean and nicky
in their time of grief
oh how is seans grief
hes he is holding up
very well
as well as can be expected
uhhuh
is that everything or
let me ask you something
were you aware
that he took out
an extra 4 million
life insurance policy
on emily before
she disappeared
i was not aware of that no
i why how would i
okay all right
yeah i dont
im sorry what did
what are you are you saying
he had her rubbed out
he hired a hitman
i didnt say anything
about him hiring a hitman
you just did
okay i can see
that youre enjoying yourself
detective summerville
but if you wanna
grill someone you should
really speak to emilys
boss dennis nylon
he could not be
more suspicious
thats super interesting
because he contacted us
and he said he thought you knew
more than you were letting on
well he he sucks
so
as long as youre honest
with me ms smothers
i swear to you you have
nothing to worry about okay
im just following breadcrumbs
wherever they lead
okay you know what
im done for now
thanks for your time
your theory
doesnt hold water you know
because it doesnt explain
the fake plane ticket
or the rental car
and why would someone
shoot her full of heroin
at a summer camp in michigan
theres plenty of good heroin
right here in connecticut
im told
great good okay
so we have a lot to talk about
all right then
enjoy the new house
the worst breadcrumbs
ive ever heard of you know
couldnt fill a caesar salad
with those breadcrumbs
ohh ugh
why is this
caesarean salad so crunchy
its caesar salad baby
and its delicious
whats in it
breadcrumbs
oh
how was your day at work
grim
spent most of the day
explaining the difference
between your possessive
and youre apostrophe re
to college juniors
i can see how that might
drive a man over the edge
i know right
what about you boys
whatd you guys get up to
today at school
i saw my mom
um
i understand nicky
that sometimes
we think we see people
that we miss
even if theyre gone
no i saw her
she was right outside
the fence
by the kickball yard
at recess
well lots of people
look like someone else
nobody looks like mom
she told me
to say hi to stephanie
nicky this is unhealthy
miles saw her too
right miles
i think i did
but i dont know
i was playing tetherball
did you two hatch this up
is this a game like when you
smash everything with trucks
because you know
what we say about lying
im not lying
i saw her fuck you
hey nicky
oopsy
im sorry
dont i get a kiss
good night
of course you do sweetie
actually you owe
the oopsy jar a quarter
for earlier but i
good night sweetie
hey
we should get naked
what is it
whats wrong
i smell her sean
i smell her perfume
its all over nicky
like a ghost
he probably got
to her perfume bottle
in the medicine cabinet
he misses her
okay its just you
being paranoid
is it because
i found this too
whats this
its the friendship
bracelet i made her
im afraid to say
she would not have kept this
she hated stuff like this
she probably gave it to him
right after you gave it to her
unless hes telling the truth
you saw her
with your own eyes
in her coffin
there was something off
they found her
at the bottom of a lake
you saw her tattoo
and you saw that ring
that she stole from my mother
she said your mother
wanted her to have that ring
she said your
mother insisted
thats what she told you
my father gave that ring
to my mother
it was like the only bit of
jewelry that she ever owned
i took emily to london to meet
my mother after we eloped
it went missing that weekend
my mother was frantic
we searched everywhere
nothing we didnt
find a single thing
my mother was devastated
so we took our flight
back to new york
guess what i found
what did you find
no
no way
my little sherlock holmes
mum is gonna
be so relieved
oh come on baby
your mom will take it
to the grave what a waste
its so pretty
excuse me
not amusing my darling
not in the slightest
im not joking
in the slightest
my darling
i took it i dont have any
intention of giving it back
of course
were gonna give it back
no
well tell her it just slipped
into your purse by accident
and weve only
found it now
but if you tell her
that i found it
then i have to tell her
that i stole it
and what do you think
will be worse for her
thinking that
she lost her ring
or thinking that her son
married a thief
baby
hey
you choose her or me
meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds
knock twice
nine months later
nicky was born
how could you stay with her
i was spellbound
she was the only woman
i could never figure out fully
and as a young
arrogant writer
i could never live up
to what she expected of me
i was always
looking over my shoulder
i could hardly sleep
but with you its different
i sleep like a log
thats what every woman
wants to hear
you know what i mean
you understand me
you see me
youve rebuilt me
stephanie
ive even started
writing again
first couple of chapters
but its a start
oh
thats wonderful
you took a broken man
and you pieced him
back together again

woman ive ever met

what will people think
theyre already thinking it
and im tired of lying
im tired of pretending
i want to be this man
the man i am with you
i dont do threesomes
i want to say that ill just
get that out in the open
what are you talking about
your ta
emily told me
about your little moment
thats what she told you
yes
stephanie listen
emily was a pathological liar
that never happened okay
why did you take out
a 4 million
insurance policy on her
my gosh those cops really did
a number on you didnt they
im being serious
it was because of you
when emily found out
that you had been
living off your husbands
insurance money
she thought she and i
needed to get policies
out for nickys sake
its probably the most
responsible thing we ever did
thanks to you
move in with me
we can start a whole new
wonderful life together
just you me and the boys
please say yes
i love you
stephanie smothers
i love you too
hmm
hi moms stephanie here

emilys dead
my condolences
who the fuck is emily
the girl in the painting
good her names not emily
her names claudia
rest in peace asshole
so not a pleasant memory
for you then
no opposite
she was amazing
i mean she was the best
that i ever had
i was selling paintings
you know
it was the first time
in my career
that i had any buzz
she walked
into my gallery
a real fucking muse
just right out of thin air
what happened
she was all i could paint
i memorized
every inch of her body
my dealer fucking hated it
and the art critics
fucking hated it
they called me a knockoff
a dyke mapplethorpe
anyway i blew my whole career
painting that con artist
now all i paint
are these goddamn knives
which are pretty good but
nobody wants to buy this shit
oh what theyre so good
people are just jealous
i havent had a drink
in 42 days
oh dont
might as well celebrate
mmm well cheers
i gave her my heart
and i gave her my soul
i paid for her
to go to college
i paid off her debts
did you ever
see any heroin use
no no way her
no she didnt touch it
shit
she never let me paint
her face except for this one
ive never seen
such a beautiful girl
want to be so invisible
or just completely vanish
but you know what
it takes money to vanish
and so she took everything
that she could from me
you know
how i would paint you
beatific
like like a fucking saint
i get that a lot
you should embrace it
people love saints
yeah after theyre dead
okay what do you know
about her how did she die
in a lake
on heroin
well you dont believe that
or you wouldnt be here
she didnt ever mention
michigan did she
huh
that is the only thing
that she ever left here
she said she had it
since she was a kid
i warn you you go
poking around in her past
youre gonna find
some shit that is terrifying
she was not a normal person
like you or me
sean its stephanie
i thought about
what you said
and youre right
these are just stages of grief
this experience has been
so stressful for both of us
im gonna take
a couple of days to myself

for your late wife

the dna match
and if thats the case
then where is emily

shed come home
shed wanna see her son
im not a cop and im
definitely no therapist
im just an insurance guy

its unusual
to live with someone
as husband and wife

private person

you can understand
with a payment of this size

findings to the authorities

hi moms stephanie here
today were talking about
tombstone tributes
i want to thank helen
from missoula montana
for the suggestions
for thinking outside the box
you know it doesnt have
to just be flowers anymore
i think any item that
sparks a fond memory is perfect
and emilys favorite treat
was a dry gin martini
in the late afternoon
im gonna make a couple
just like emily used to
frozen gin frozen glass
generous twist
im gonna head out there
a little later today
have a toast on her grave
nice big twist
i taught you well
students become
the master
ooh wisdom
hey give me that
i dont know
what tricks you have
up those new
sleeves of yours
you think
i poisoned both drinks
thats not my style
i dont even eat gluten
want another
please
first tell me why you killed
your father and sister
okay why dont we first talk
about your sons real father
oh emily
i hold all the cards here
i wanna know
about your twin faith
im not a twin
great i know that you are
we were triplets
faith hope and charity
charity was stillborn
mom thought
we offed her in the womb
hmm
dad believed her
shes quite a woman
your mother
i had a nice afternoon
with mags
you met my mother
she likes her martinis
even stronger than yours
we had a little walk
down memory lane
shes a cold woman em
bet you couldnt do
anything right in her eyes
it was probably
faiths idea to set the fire
but then all the bad ideas
were faiths werent they
you dont know anything
sure i do
and i get it
youre 16
its that age
where you feel so trapped
and if your mother always
had the biting comment
faith its over lets go
dad dad
dad dont touch me
its not my fault
im guessing your father
was more direct
mr mclanden whore
never again
stop
thats when you and faith
learned to hit
the reset button right
burn baby burn
whyd you leave each other
well we couldnt stay
together after the fire
the cops were looking for
the big blonde arson twins
we were a walking sideshow
fuck off
we we had to say goodbye
so we did it with tattoos
flames and a little
something for charity
we split up
in corpus christi
she was gonna head south to
mexico i was gonna go north
we set a time
and place to meet
after the smoke cleared
but then
she never showed up
i was worried sick
i waited for days
but nothing
you know i thought
maybe this was
my opportunity
to do it on my own
she was always
getting me into trouble
so i bought a oneway ticket to
new york and never looked back
did you miss her
of course i missed her
i wasnt whole without her
but i couldnt go on like that
i had to survive
and it worked
yeah my life in new york
fell into place
i got a job
worked my way up
i met the perfect man
oh you know
that part though
and then your sister calls
fucking facebook
you had to see her
yeah of course i did
so you fabricate
this trip to miami
meet up at the old camp
camp bunk four
it was our happy place
it was the only place we could
escape our dad really
it must have been shocking
to see her
after all those years
yeah it was like
looking in the mirror
except at the sick life
she chose over me
what did she want
everything
you just gonna stand there
you gotta have faith
i dont hear from you
for 14 years
and now here you are
im out of cash
shocking
the fuck did you say
nothing i just
get away with it this time
okay so um now what
i dont know
i didnt know where to go
when i call
you act like a stranger
wont even let me
come meet your family
what am i supposed
to say to them
the truth
well you may as well now
cause im about
to tell the cops
youre what
i dont know what else to do
i mean i dont have anything
so i dont really have
anything to lose
im gonna go tell them
everything we did
and then you know
well go down together

yeah ill um
ill sell the house
ill do whatever i need to do
if i do this
you cant tell anyone ever

the big deal though

but i just thought
the only chance
we had was alone so
you were right

i never thought
shed do that you know
when i found her body
in the lake it was too late

no youre a sister killer
youre a brotherfucker
ooh

everything
it was his idea
i didnt know what to do
once i found the body
and he said you know
maybe this is our opportunity
we could finally
get out of debt
flee the country
spend more time with nicky
he convinced me
we could pull it off
you know that her dna
would do the rest
i dont believe you
he grieved for you
oh you believed that
aw that was all an act
youre a pathological liar
did sean say that
cool
im just gonna play you
this tune real quick
do you love her

a shocking new development
in the emily nelson case
which first went viral
on a popular internet vlog
the pr executive
who was believed dead
in michigan has resurfaced
and it appears
the body found in the lake
was that of nelsons
estranged twin sister
nelsons husband
sean townsend
an abusive failed novelist
and english professor
allegedly forced her
to stage her own death
in order to collect a 4 million
life insurance policy
nevertheless
bail for mr townsend
will be set today
a british national
townsend faces deportation
if found guilty
although
an accomplice to fraud
ms nelson is complying
with the authorities
in exchange for clemency
stephanie

watching a movie
oof
i figured we needed some
mommy and daddy time
have you forgotten
me already
youre impossible to forget
thank you
oh please sean
im not gonna poison you
if i wanted to get rid of you
youd already be dead
you put those files
on my computer
yes i did
but i did have help
from a woman
who loves volunteering
for everything
stephanie
shes not as sweet
as her snatch is she
were you ever gonna tell me
you had a twin sister
wasnt your business
im your husband
youve been fucking
my best friend in my house
but now youre
my husband okay
then i should probably tell
you that we were triplets
the details
hi moms
stephanie here
i wanna thank you for all
the love and support
youve been sending me
it means so much
um
you know as shocked
as you guys are
about these turns of events
i can assure you nobody
is more stunned than me
emily had her secrets
so did her husband
clearly i was
the naive romantic
caught in the middle
i love you guys i always will
i hope you can forgive me in
advance for what i have to do
moms do everything yourself
stephanie
you shouldnt be here right now
i used to live here remember
dont make this any hard
dont move
stephanie please
you dont even let the boys
play with squirt guns
that was before
you told me you loved me
and it turned out you were
laughing at me behind my back
stephanie maybe we should
take it down a notch
you used me
you used me too
but you had me
making you dinner
watching your kid
and sucking your dick
i had no idea
that she was still alive
stop lying
okay you guys
i think we should just
sit down and talk this out
emily you sit down
you hated stephanie
you used to watch her vlog
and rip her apart
all i wanted
was to be your friend
you were
and then you fucked my husband
and my insurance plan
dont blame her
this is so typical of you
i was just trying to get us
out of crushing fucking debt
yeah maybe if you had the
good sense to give me a call
i couldve helped you with
this little plot of yours
please you havent come up
with a decent plot in 10 years
really right now
can i say something
as the lady with the gun
nicky deserves better
than both of you
fuck you i love my kid
shut up
stephanie put down the gun
you dont wanna do this
i really do though
i loved you
i loved you too
i think this is the best thing
whoa
we could say he attacked us
theyll believe us you know
no no no
youre not fucking serious
youre not gonna kill him
were just gonna
send him to jail
j are you serious
jails enough for you
you dont need to kill him
arent you angry
dont you want revenge
for your sister
yeah yes but he didnt
technically kill her

that it was an accident
screw this
oh
oh my god
oh fuck
oh my god jesus
oh my god um
oh my god

no i killed her
i killed my sister
what sean sean
get up
shows over come on
seriously come on
get the fuck up hey
you too brando
get up
fuck
wow
that was extra
i mean obviously i knew you
guys were up to something
when i saw both the mics
that you had the cops
plant in here
you clearly wanted
a confession out of me
so you could clear
seans name
but that was that was
a good way to go about it
where you messed up
though baby girl
is thinking
that i would confess
to protect that
fucking yeast infection
really
all right
come on you gotta know
better than that
hmm
but then you came in
all emotional with the gun
and that was
that was convincing
yeah it was very cinematic
i dont even know
where you find this shit
youre really amazing
thanks that means a lot
mmm
but you did confess emily
oh yeah
um
i did but i cut
these first though
for our friendship bracelets
one for you
that is disappointing
oh my god
look what i found
huh
okay you cant shoot us
the police are outside
no theyre not
hey cops stephanie here
change of plans
im meeting emily and sean
at darrens house now
ill see you there
you sent them
to darrens house
its a virus
string theory
string theory isnt it
hands up weapons down
no i have
a prescription for that
i have ocular pressure
ive been on the run
for 10 years
you think i dont know how
to manipulate the system
so youre gonna kill us
well what the fuck else
am i supposed to do
you two will clearly go
to extraordinary lengths
to take me down
and you know too much
so i feel like
a murdersuicide
is the only fitting end
for you two
and if you kill him
i think our insurance
still covers that right
i mean its sort of perfect
one door closes and another
one opens thank you for that
you always have been
fucking crazy havent you
have i
ugh
oh shit youre right
god you fucking
you actually fucking shot me

husbandfucking best friend

your best friend
youre not just saying
that for you know

just saying that at all
i get worried that its just me
i know sometimes
i was worried about that too
its so hard to connect
with other moms
and then when you have
a fulltime job its
okay okay
dont pull that crap
being a mom is a fulltime job
what i do is hard work
and i have my vlog
on top of that
and thats just getting
bigger and bigger
if you came on the vlog
thatd be so fun
if you came on the vlog

a million subscribers
