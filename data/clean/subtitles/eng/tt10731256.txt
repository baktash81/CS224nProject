but on this occasion
we just couldnt wait
to celebrate
our newest residents
bill violet
i am so happy for you
that you get to learn
from my husband
and join this mission
and become a part
of this family
frank has built something
truly special
what hes created out here
its
its a different way
a better way
and we only have each other
woman why are we here
man whispering tersely
whispering
lets go right now
we shouldnt be here
whispering what was that
faint chatter
frank now now
margaret and ted are
going through a difficult time
margarets question is right
it is the good question to ask
why the hell are we here
chuckles
scattered laughter
why when this landscape
can seem so
barren so hard so dusty so
worthless
why not run
why not go back to safety
status quo
where its safe
where we should be
no i choose
we choose to stand our ground
right
to look harder to dig deeper
to mine that pure
unbridled potential
that gem of limitless
and unimaginable value
its just too easy to get
distracted by what seems
much more difficult braver
i would say
to search for what could be
dean
dean hm
what is the enemy of progress
chaos
yes
shudders
dean chuckles
nasty word chaos
merciless foe that chaos
energy unfocused
innovation hindered
hope strangled
greatness disguised
i see greatness
in each one of you
i know exactly who you are
what are we doing
all changing the world
what are we doing
all changing the world
thats right
i look around i see
another reason why im here
once unfamiliar faces
strangers one and all now
one brave family
men like dr collins
one of our first who built
this community with me
thank you
dr collins for your vision
and adventurers like bill
our newest intrepid explorer
this brave
young robinson crusoe
whos choosing to join us
on this adventure
bill thank you
for being our partner in this
and thank you violet
for being his partner in this
he could not do this
without you
all of you wives
we men we ask a lot
we ask for strength
a shoulder to cry on
food at home a house cleaned
and discretion above all else
and that
thats very difficult
you are my rock
i would not be here without you
thank you
cheers laughter
youre all dismissed

peg mmhm
its true you dont have to
worry about the weather
or learning to drive ugh
i love driving
bunny no
you love jack
teaching you to drive
thats foreplay
circle back to the guest list
were kathy and bob at franks
i think so
really
wow so it just seems
very random right
who is invited and who isnt
it has nothing to do
with seniority or success
or even being wellliked right
splishsplash whos ready
to dive into summer
charge that
hideous
i heard margaret made a scene
oh my god
threw a drink in someones face
alice what no
that did not happen
sighing she was upset
it was humiliating
and shes gonna get ted fired
oh
if peter got fired
id kill myself
not kidding
cant live anywhere else
margaret is just having
a really hard time
whose fault is that
i know
i still feel bad for her
of course
it was a terrible accident
it wasnt an accident
bunny stop come on
i dont want to be rude i know
that she was your friend
she was our friend
when she was normal
and then she lost her mind
she took her son
out into that desert
she thought she saw something
bunny she hallucinated
alice well it wasnt exactly
clear as to what happened
bunny she knew how dangerous
it was just like we all do
the one thing
they ask of us is to stay here
where its safe
but still she dragged that
little boy out into the middle
of godknowswhat
peg groans
bunny if they dont want us
going out there
they have their reasons
peg so when they found her
bunny she was alone
they never found him
oh
i knew he died i
i just hadnt realized
bunny she claims
they took him to punish her
loud rumbling
boys and their toys
least we know theyre
getting work done
what do you think
theyre really doing out there
what do you mean
i mean i know what they say
you know development
of progressive materials
but sometimes peter insinuates
that theyre
actually making weapons
and that its all
happening underground
because frank discovered
peg
sorry
were all here because
we believe in the mission
yes
we have jobs too that are just
as important just as vital
what we do at home
supporting them
taking care of them
without that they couldnt be
out there changing the world
mm
gasping
panting heavily
frank on radio everyone
focuses on the sacrifices
you make by going
after what you want
i want you to focus
on the sacrifices you make
by standing still
by not going after what you
know you are owed by giving up
and taking the smaller version
of your life
sacrifice doesnt just
take courage
it takes faith saying
i will stand this pain
this hurt this effort
knowing that what i want
is waiting on the other side
alice humming melody
frank on radio its scary
to sacrifice something
but youre sacrificing
something more
by sitting in that fear
until tomorrow
to know him
is to love him playing
bell clanging
carol connors
to know know know him
is to love love love him
just to see him smile
makes my life worthwhile

runofthemill exhaustion
you had any new stresses
or pressures lately
um
jack she saw teds wife fall
thought maybe it might be shock
dr collins boy
that was quite a tumble
she was so embarrassed
it it wasnt a tumble
she slit her throat
jack alice
uh no no no
witnessing a trauma can often
lead to distorted memories
even nightmares
its
i have some pills
i can prescribe for that
uh i i really dont think
that i need those
oh theyre precautionary
most of my patients have had
quite a bit of success
with them
they will just keep you relaxed
jack she doesnt need those
this isnt a problem
we can handle it ourselves
well ill just
keep that on file
what did you do to margaret
pardon
teds wife
im sorry im just i
i still dont understand
how shes okay
you wouldnt want me discussing
the details of your treatment
with my other patients now
would you
mm i wouldnt mind
i would just i would really
love to know the details of
of how you fixed her
well as you know we provide
both psychiatric
and physical care here
and margaret was
in need of both
the good news is
is that physically shes fine
but psychologically she wasnt
she was having
significant troubles
outbursts paranoia
she made it impossible
for ted to do his job
so he no longer works
for the victory project
she needed quite a bit of help
ah not like you
jack no
dry chuckle
jack its not necessary here
its a totally
different scenario
what is it that you brits say

clears throat
peter nice to see
a familiar face
bill um so anyways
those windows right there
the slatted windows
theyre actually called
jalousie windows
did you know that
you didnt know why
peter oh boy
so the etymology is
in french accent
jealousy
and you say
whose baby is this
and they say its your baby
and you say
how could that be
and it is your baby
and i just do it every year
violet where are you from
chatter subsides
pardon
i said where are you from
philadelphia
mm im from philadelphia
laughing are you serious
i didnt know that
i knew i liked you
alice most of the women here

or baltimore or chicago
ive noticed
jack mm can i

peg i for one do not miss
the winters
no no no
i thrive in the sunshine
even though
im alabasterskinned
i love the sunshine
i love the beach
peg mm
jack she does
what was the last beach
you went to
peter oh fun fact
about the beach
i read this
yeah
beaches are actually some
of the filthiest places
in the whole world
just a sandbox of disease and
peter chuckles nervously
do not say disease
at the dinner table
peter its true
they need to know
i can probably guess
hilton head cape cod
or the jersey shore
and we all honeymooned
in sea island
or the poconos
or niagara falls
i think those are popular
honeymoon destinations
expensive
mmhm beautiful beautiful
peter you uh you havent
finished your story
peter mm
bill over heres probably
one of the worst golf players
im sorry peter

yes thats true im jealous
frank is it
honestly its such a sweet story
frank wow
yeah yeah
frank laughs
isnt that funny
the way those coincidences
incredible
alice there are only so many
different stories were told
were told what we remember
until
we try to remember things
that they want us to forget
like margaret
alice
no jack its okay
im curious to hear
where shes going with this
frank is doing something to us
delusions memory problems
hysteria
we saw these issues
with margaret
and know that its uh
completely curable
dr collins prescribed you
a suite of medications
which you are
clearly not taking
the question is why
hes lying to us
hes lying to all of us
bunny your best friend
is worried about you
she thinks that you need help
is that why shes
not here tonight
because you didnt want
to be reminded of that
hes using you
hes using all of us
do you even know what
the victory project actually is
have you ever asked
do you
is that why you went out there
to headquarters
what
im sorry im so sorry
alice
but you dont know
what hes doing
frank you wandered out
by yourself
you ignored every rule
and she put all your lives
in danger
yes i did go out there
and i went to headquarters
and i saw what hes hiding
frank what im hiding
alice hes lying to us
frank oh dear
alice hes lying to all of us
about what the victory project
actually is
hes trapped us here
frank alice
trapped
i hope no one feels trapped
do you feel trapped
violet
peg
awkward chuckle
this is your psychosis
you are experiencing trust
as a feeling of entrapment
yet you trust every day
we all do
tonight youve trusted us
in your home
just like i trusted you
in my bedroom
alice
do you remember that
hes hes trying
to create a world
if you want to articulate your own argument
hes using us
try using your own words alice
hes using all of us
in your own words
whats in this food
lets talk about that
where did it come from huh
frank oh im sorry everyone
im sorry

comes from him
and its all about control
its all about control
frank laughs
we wouldnt even
he might be poisoning the food
enough
we come to your house
we sit at your table
and you insult
and degrade my husband
he invites you
to be a part of something
as extraordinary as he is
and you sit there
like a spoiled brat
demanding answers
to questions youve made up
theres a pattern isnt there
a pattern of selfish
pampered whining
or is it just a desperation
to be exciting
hm
spitting in the face
of this opportunity
its heartbreaking that your
sad desperate paranoia
could destroy
what were trying to build
hm
well i wont listen to your
pathetic ranting any longer
frank honey

we stood and talked
like this before
we looked at each other
in the same way then

or when
the clothes youre wearing
are the clothes you wore
the smile you are smiling
you were smiling then
but i cant remember where

some things that happened
for the first time
seem to be happening
again
and so it seems
that weve met before
and laughed before
and loved before
but who knows
where
or when
