less important department

frank doesn t have to talk
to you 
oh  i m sorry  i didn t   
you have no idea
how extraordinary he is 
or what he can do

 glass chiming 
  oh  guys  guys  guys  go  go  go  go

 light chatter  laughter 
 shelley 
gather  round  everyone 
now  usually 
we don t have the opportunity
to welcome couples in our home 
but on this occasion 
we just couldn t wait
to celebrate
our newest residents 
bill  violet   
i am so happy for you 
that you get to learn
from my husband   
and join this mission
and become a part
of this family 
frank has built something
truly special 
what he s created out here 
it s   
it s a different way 
a better way 
  and we only have each other   
   woman  why are we here 
 man whispering tersely 
 whispering 
let s go  right now 
we shouldn t be here 
   whispering  what was that 
   faint chatter 
 frank  now  now 
margaret and ted are
going through a difficult time 
margaret s question is right 
it is the good question to ask 
why the hell are we here 
   chuckles 
   scattered laughter 
why  when this landscape
can seem so   
barren  so hard  so dusty  so   
worthless 
why not run 
why not go back to safety 
status quo 
where it s safe 
where we should be 
no  i choose   
we choose to stand our ground 
right 
to look harder  to dig deeper 
to mine that pure 
unbridled potential 
that gem of limitless
and unimaginable value 
it s just too easy to get
distracted by what seems 
much more difficult   braver  
i would say   
to search for what could be 
  dean   
   dean  hm 
what is the enemy of progress 
  chaos 
  yes 
   shudders 
   dean chuckles 
nasty word  chaos 
merciless foe  that chaos 
energy unfocused 
innovation hindered 
hope strangled 
greatness disguised 
i see greatness
in each one of you 
i know exactly who you are 
  what are we doing 
   all  changing the world 
  what are we doing 
   all  changing the world 
that s right 
i look around  i see
another reason why i m here 
once unfamiliar faces 
strangers  one and all  now   
one brave family 
men like dr  collins 
one of our first  who built
this community with me 
thank you 
dr  collins for your vision 
and adventurers like bill 
our newest intrepid explorer 
this brave 
young robinson crusoe 
who s choosing to join us
on this adventure 
bill  thank you
for being our partner in this 
and thank you  violet 
for being his partner in this 
he could not do this
without you 
all of you wives   
we men  we ask a lot 
we ask for strength 
a shoulder to cry on   
food at home  a house cleaned 
and discretion  above all else 
and that   
that s very difficult 
you are my rock 
i would not be here without you 
thank you 
 cheers  laughter 
  you re all dismissed 
   all laughing 
 whispering indistinctly

people outside 
 alice laughs quietly 
 exhaling 
 panting 
 panting quickens 
wow him in a doubles game 
he ll 40 love this look 
 bunny  oh  yes  yes  yes 
can you charge that
to dean s account 
 peg  i still can t believe
we can just charge  everywhere 
 bunny  yes 
but victory has things
  money can t buy 
   peg  mm hm 
it s true  you don t have to
worry about the weather
or learning to drive  ugh 
  i love driving 
   bunny  no 
you love jack
teaching you to drive 
that s foreplay 
circle back to the guest list 
were kathy and bob at frank s 
  i think so 
  really 
wow  so it just seems
very random  right 
who is invited and who isn t 
it has nothing to do
with seniority  or success 
or even being well liked  right 
splish splash  who s ready
to dive into summer 
  charge that 
  hideous 
  i heard margaret made a scene 
  oh  my god 
threw a drink in someone s face 
 alice  what  no 
that did not happen 
 sighing  she was upset 
it was humiliating 
and she s gonna get ted fired 
oh 
if peter got fired   
i d kill myself 
not kidding 
can t live anywhere else 
margaret is just having
a really hard time 
whose fault is that 
i know 
i still feel bad for her 
of course 
it was a terrible accident 
it wasn t an accident 
bunny  stop  come on 
i don t want to be rude  i know
that she was your friend 
she was our friend 
when she was normal 
and then she lost her mind 
she took her son
out into that desert 
  she thought she saw something 
   bunny  she hallucinated 
 alice  well  it wasn t exactly
clear as to what    happened 
 bunny  she knew how dangerous
it was  just like we all do 
the one thing
they ask of us is to stay here 
where it s safe 
but still  she dragged that
little boy out into the middle
  of god knows what 
   peg groans 
 bunny  if they don t want us
going out there 
they have their reasons 
 peg  so when they found her   
 bunny  she was alone 
they never found him 
oh 
i knew he died  i   
i just hadn t realized   
 bunny  she claims
they took him to punish her 
 loud rumbling 
boys and their toys 
least we know they re
getting work done 
what do you think
they re really doing out there 
  what do you mean 
  i mean  i know what they say   
you know   development
of progressive materials  
but  sometimes peter insinuates
that they re
actually making weapons 
and that it s all
happening underground 
  because frank discovered   
  peg 
sorry 
we re all here because
we believe in the mission 
yes 
we have jobs too  that are just
as important  just as vital 
what we do at home 
supporting them 
taking care of them 
without that  they couldn t be
out there changing the world 
mm 
 gasping 
 panting heavily 
 frank on radio  everyone
focuses on the sacrifices
you make by going
after what you want 
i want you to focus
on the sacrifices you make
by standing still 
by not going after what you
know you are owed by giving up 
and taking the smaller version
of your life 
sacrifice doesn t just
take courage 
it takes faith  saying 
 i will stand this pain 
this hurt  this effort 
knowing that what i want
is waiting on the other side  
 alice humming melody 
 frank on radio  it s scary
to sacrifice something 
but you re sacrificing
something more
by sitting in that fear 
until tomorrow 
  to know him
is to love him  playing 
 bell clanging 
 carol connors 
  to know  know  know him  
  is to love  love  love him  
  just to see him smile  
  makes my life worthwhile  
  to know  know  know him     
 driver  no shopping today  huh

that was quite a tumble

lead to distorted memories 
even nightmares 
it s   
i have some pills
i can prescribe for that

that i need those 
oh  they re precautionary 
most of my patients have had
quite a bit of success
with them 
they will just keep you relaxed 
 jack  she doesn t need those

we can handle it ourselves

keep that on file 
what did you do to margaret 
pardon 
ted s wife 
i m sorry  i m just    i   
i still don t understand
how she s okay 
you wouldn t want me discussing
the details of your treatment
with my other patients  now 
would you

i would just    i would really
love to know the details of   
of how you fixed her 
well  as you know  we provide
both psychiatric
and physical care here 
and margaret was
in need of both 
the good news is 
is that physically  she s fine 
but psychologically  she wasn t 
she was having
significant troubles 
outbursts  paranoia 
she made it impossible
for ted to do his job 
so he no longer works
for the victory project 
she needed quite a bit of help

i don t know if

 chatter stops 
 chuckles softly

   chatter resumes 
   clears throat 
 peter  nice to see
a familiar face 
 bill  um  so anyways 
those windows right there 
the slatted windows 
they re actually called
 jalousie  windows 
did you know that 
  you didn t know why 
   peter  oh  boy 
so  the etymology is   
 in french accent 
    jealousy  
and you say 
 whose baby is this  
and they say   it s your baby  
and you say 
 how could that be  
and it is your baby 
and i just do it every year 
  violet  where are you from 
   chatter subsides 
  pardon 
  i said   where are you from  
philadelphia 
  mm  i m from philadelphia 
   laughing  are you serious 
  i didn t know that 
  i knew i liked you 
 alice  most of the women here

or baltimore  or chicago 
i ve noticed 
 jack  mm  can i
get anyone anything 
 peg  i for one do not miss
the winters 
no  no  no 
i thrive in the sunshine 
even though
i m alabaster skinned 
i love the sunshine 
i love the beach 
   peg  mm 
   jack  she does 
what was the last beach
you went to 
 peter  oh  fun fact
about the beach 
  i read this 
  yeah 
beaches are actually some
of the filthiest places
in the whole world 
  just a sandbox of disease and   
  peter   chuckles nervously 
do not say  disease 
at the dinner table 
 peter  it s true 
they need to know 
i can probably guess 
hilton head  cape cod 
or the jersey shore 
and we all honeymooned
in sea island 
or the poconos 
or niagara falls 
i think those are popular
honeymoon destinations 
  expensive 
  mm hm  beautiful  beautiful 
peter  you  uh    you haven t
finished your story 
 peter  mm 
bill over here s probably
  one of the worst golf players   
  i m sorry  peter 
i m not quite finished  violet 
where did you meet bill 
well  we met on a train 
  to boston 
   violet  to boston 
yeah 
  yes 
   both laughing 
you dropped your ticket 
and he bent down  picked it up 
gave it to you  right 
it is  yeah 
that s how margaret met ted 
and peg  am i right in thinking
that s how debbie mcintyre
met her husband 
yes  i am  that s how they met 
  yes  that s true  i m jealous 
   frank  is it 
  honestly  it s such a sweet story 
   frank  wow 
  yeah  yeah 
   frank laughs 
isn t that funny 
the way those coincidences   
incredible 
 alice  there are only so many
different stories we re told 
we re told what we remember 
until   
we try to remember things   
that they want us to forget 
  like margaret 
  alice   
no  jack  it s okay 
i m curious to hear
where she s going with this 
frank is doing something to us 
delusions  memory problems 
hysteria 
we saw these issues
with margaret 
and know that it s  uh 
completely curable 
dr  collins prescribed you
a suite of medications 
which you are
clearly not taking 
the question is why   
he s lying to us 
he s lying to all of us 
bunny  your best friend 
is worried about you 
she thinks that you need help 
is that why she s
not here tonight 
because you didn t want
to be reminded of that 
he s using you 
he s using all of us 
do you even know what
the victory project actually is 
  have you ever asked 
  do you 
is that why you went out there 
to headquarters 
what 
  i m sorry  i m so sorry 
  alice   
but you don t know
what he s doing 
 frank  you wandered out
by yourself 
you ignored every rule 
and she put all your lives
in danger 
yes  i did go out there
and i went to headquarters
and i saw what he s hiding 
   frank  what i m hiding 
   alice  he s lying to us 
   frank  oh  dear 
   alice  he s lying to all of us
about what the victory project
actually is 
  he s trapped us here 
   frank  alice

in your home 
just like i trusted you
in my bedroom 
alice

   frank laughs 
we wouldn t even   
he might be poisoning the food 
enough 
we come to your house 
we sit at your table 
and you insult
and degrade my husband 
he invites you
to be a part of something
as extraordinary as he is 
and you sit there
like a spoiled brat 
demanding answers
to questions you ve made up 
there s a pattern  isn t there 
a pattern of selfish 
pampered whining 
or is it just a desperation
to be exciting 
hm 
spitting in the face
of this opportunity 
it s heartbreaking that your
sad  desperate paranoia
could destroy
what we re trying to build 
hm
