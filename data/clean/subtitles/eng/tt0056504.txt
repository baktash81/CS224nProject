of sodom and gomorrah 
in these cities of sin
and vice without borders 
the greed for power and wealth
had also gripped the desert tribes 
which became more and more threatening 
your mighty leader
was the prince of the helamites 
even if so many subordinates
are loyal to your prince 
our attack may only take place
when my horse troop
has returned 
tell your prince 
i m looking forward to the day 
at which we shall
shed the blood of our enemies 
i thank you  prince 
beware
of the sodomite scouts 
there she is  after her 
faster 
  faster 
  stop 
stop 
  stop 
  no 
  get off your horse  get down 
  no 
who sent you
to the elamites 
  let go of me 
  who sent you 
tamar 
the prince s secret messenger 
she will talk 
we must
bring news to the prince 
while in sodom and gomorrah
betrayal and intrigue reigned 
a peaceful people wandered
through the desert  the hebrews 
you were looking for
pasture for your cattle
and for food for yourself 
the tribes of abraham and lot were together
and the country
could not stand it
that they dwelt together 
for their number was great 
abraham said to lot 
if you want to go to the left 
i ll walk to the right 
or if you want to go to the right 
i ll walk to the left 
and lot voted and went with all
his people against the jordan valley 
go back to lot 
maybe he ll carry you 
oh  sir 
if it is your will that my people
should take this arduous journey
so help me not to show any tiredness 
give our bodies strength for the future 
to overcome all the hardship 
first of all the thirst that plagues us 
help us  oh lord 
to conquer the fear
that gnaws at our hearts 
the way was long and arduous 
thirst  hunger and exhaustion
attacked lot s people 
hopelessness spread
and sowed discord 
only the sick
should drink from it  says lot 
aren t you sick  isaac 
  are you feeling well 
  cut them open 
come on  let the cool water run over
your hands  your face 
  wet your lips and mouth 
  no  no  please 
if lot gets angry  then
you say  but  lot  i m sick 
look  i m dying of thirst  here 
  no 
  take it 
  no  no  i beg you 
  come on 
  come on 
  no 
hold on  isaac  stop 
please let me drink 
i m sick  lot 
the water is for the sick 
please give me a drink 
  help him 
  who made him sick 
who got him so far that
he can t control himself 
  lot is to blame  let us repent 
  repent 
now that we
are at our destination in a few days 
maybe in a few hours 
he is incapable of leading us 
we have endured enough 
he s right 
it is not customary to decide
such questions with a weapon 
give orders that we repent 
we elders have chosen lot
as our guide  melchior 
  you have a duty to obey 
  this staff belongs in my hand 
i d better guide you 
since melchior is keen on action 
he can accompany me on a corridor 
we ll investigate
how far we still have it 
come on  melchior 
water 
come  to drink 
wait 
where there is water in the desert 
there is danger 
  back with you 
  let them come closer 
  what are you doing here 
  we hope to find water 
there is no water in this oasis 
not for 3 years 
  you are the hebrews 
  yes 
our scouts have informed us
of your coming 
they say your men have beards
but you are shaved 
why 
during the period of mourning
our men shave 
are you grieving  to whom 
  for a favorite 
  my wife 
the wife  a wife is easy
to replace  am i right 
where can we get water 
many are sick with thirst 
maybe they
need not only water  but also salt 
salt  salt makes you even more thirsty 
it s a secret
as old as our city 
when one is weak and exhausted
from thirst and heat  one needs salt 
unfortunately i gave away my salt
for the slaves 
i bought her
for the queen 
it cost 4 times its weight
in salt 
poor creatures 
am i a poor creature too 
is your heart broken too
because of me 
i m a slave too 
the top
of the royal body slaves 
to own people as property
is wrong  evil 
evil 
what kind of views do you have 
where i come from 
there s nothing wrong with it 
everything that gives pleasure
is good 
where are you from 
not from far away 
straight ahead for a while 
sodom and gomorrah 
you people of sodom and gomorrah 
beware 
your sins
cry out for retribution 
you buy men and women
as if they were made of stone 
you treat them
as objects of your pleasure
or like machines for your work 
you force them to mine your precious
mineral wealth 
the white salt 
just to increase the prosperity
of your nefarious cities 
you owe all your power and prosperity
to the salt 
and you buy this salt
with the blood of your slaves 
listen to me people of sodom 
the old fool 
shut him up 
i have to warn the prince 
hey  hey 
one day
they will destroy you 
just as your prince would even destroy his
own sister 
watch your tongue  you have
publicly blasphemed the queen s brother 
how can this person
demand submission 
how dare you
speak of it 
you have the monopoly
on the precious raw material 
which in africa
is more valuable than gold 
on the salt 
you use this material 
in order to keep an entire continent
cruelly in a stranglehold 
you exchange your salt for
gems  fragrances and slaves 
just for the insatiable greed of your
queen and her nefarious brother
to breastfeed 
we hurried
to warn you 
we were worried
that we would be late 
they
haven t been brought here yet 
it was good of you
to come here immediately 
i ll reward you for it 
now is the time to
find other means  more effective ones 
after a defeat
on the battlefield
they would be despised 
your assassination
would be celebrated as a great deed 
whoever killed them would be the
new king of sodom and gomorranh 
my sister 
she imagines she can rule
as well as a man 
she has
a cautious woman s mind 
i could found a state 
an empire 
she s just trying to hold
what we already have 
our 2 united cities 
  no  let go of me 
  in there 
there it is  stupid creature 
tamar  tamar 
up here  do not be afraid 
i ll protect you 
don t be afraid 
silence 
what message
did you bring me with you 
that the arrival of the hebrews
changes things 
he thinks
the time is not yet ripe 
quiet  i said 
take a deep breath 
breathe  do you hear 
  he s blind 
  blind 
what a nice idea 
you have a delightful imagination 
this makes the case more interesting 
an excellent refinement 
maleb 
that should loosen that faithless bitch
the tongue 
do you know the name 
then
your sisters will die 
if you have to watch it 
i ll tell him 
of all my slaves
i have given you my favor 
weren t you happy 
and not even grateful 
what message did you bring to the
helamite camp 
since when have murderers
been allowed to act as judges 
since when do traitors have the right to
ask questions 
who sent you there 
i want
you to keep your life 
what is my legacy
to you and sodom 
  no 
  are you insane  tamar 
silence 
tamar 
tamar 
tamar  the slave 
no  no  no 
make it short  please 
you re helping me with this 
have pity on me 
it will
cause me less pain  have pity  please 
the name 
please  arlok  please 
she will die without speaking 
give her the rest
if she doesn t speak 
talk  tell me the name 
who sent you
to the helamites 
speak before it s too late 
speak 
ah 
ah 
i have to praise you 
your wild cat gives the
best testimony to your taste 
thank you  mistress 
she s also proud 
after you  the 1st girl
who suppressed every scream 
  i admire pride 
  better for her if you don t like her 
if you take tamar s example 
the life prospects
of your favorite slaves
are exceptionally low 
  you met them  these hebrews 
  mmm 
my brother
didn t succeed 
even so  he never tires of warning
me about them 
i want to know why 
these hebrews
cannot be trusted 
they want everyone to behave
as their beliefs dictate 
and you tell me
they are not dangerous 
dangerous  who are they dangerous to 
us 
  didn t you say they were unarmed 
  that i saw 
i want to convince myself
why they seem threatening to you 
when my plans are ready 
we will go see them 
beloved sister  i only live
to obey your commands 
as always  he thinks no further
than the tip of his sword 
he believes these people
are a danger to us 
but in reality
your presence can be useful 
should we be attacked
by the helamites 
and in peacetime they
make themselves useful as slaves 
  for menial jobs 
  not as slaves 
your leader lot says 
no human can
own another human 
whoever has no slaves
must be very poor 
poor 
that s right 
but they seem
to be ignorant of their poverty 
if this lot prefers
not to keep slaves 
it is at his discretion 
often you can t prevent
becoming one yourself 
especially when one is seduced
by tricks 
which are as old as sodom
and as proven as gomorranh 
how often have we
heard on our marketplace 
the hebrews keep their word 
the hebrews can be relied on 
you understand  the hebrews
with their newborn religion
stand between the great mighty kingdom
my brother dreams of and us 
and between the hebrews
and the rest of the world only sodom 
and you  ildith  do you fear
being my favorite too 
  the jordan 
  how beautiful 
this is where our faith
will be put to the most severe test 
no hebrew is allowed to go into
these cities  not even near them 
no 
instruct
that no one should cross the river 
nobody is allowed to
cross the river  no one 
you my two brave daughters 
our long journey
is now over 
let everyone know that they
are not drinking too much at once 
 lord  i thank you for our
salvation and humbly ask you to
show me the rest of the way  
so let s go now  ho  forward 
i think the old alabias was still alive 
what a horrible place this is 
what a horrible blasphemy 
dead and dying 
bleached bones
under god s bright sky 
under its brilliant sun 
you will be fine 
we will take care of you 
here  drink 
slow down  drink 
what kind of place is that 
the body of the slaves
of sodom and gomorranh 
with the flesh from those bones
these wicked cities
are built 
forward 
faster 
faster  forward 
the chosen people 
that s what they call themselves 
chosen by whom 
stop 
you re right  ildith 
when it looks poor
it is easy to think of the raw
as a virtue 
or you make the mistake
and think it is weakness 
melchior 
warn our people 
nobody is allowed to cross the river 
you have to negotiate
for us 
watch out 
don t worry 
my son and i
are slaves to the queen 
we have orders
to carry you across 
  i have two legs myself 
  please 
so that i can talk to you 
you have no slaves 
no  we are all just servants
of our lord in heaven 
if my son and i
could flee to you 
would you give us refuge 
i would do that 
thank you 
  sodomite queen 
  lot 
lord of the hebrews 
there is room for your people everywhere 
what do you think you can find here that
made you wander around 
  let the land be fertile 
  for crops 
  or for your religion 
  maybe both 
if this country were yours 
you would be ready
to fight for it 
you will notice
that the nomad tribes are not peaceful 
we are not a warrior people 
but we would fight 
  to protect what is ours 
  then take possession of it 
the whole jordan valley for annual
100 000 talents of grain 
for  say  10 years 
in your interest i warn you 
the land
is barren and arid 
it is impossible for us
to raise that price 
75 000 talents  no less 
50 
agreed 
for  say  7 years 
i agree too 
my daughter shuah
brings a present for the queen 
to seal the trade 
to dry your feet 
i would like
to give you a gift in return 
  my best slave  ildith 
  but i don t want to 
i d rather die 
did i learn so much for it 
to live with this pastoral people 
in huts made of smelly skins 
you were brought up
to do what i please 
i have to refuse your gift 
it is against our belief
to own others as property 
is it also forbidden for you
by your faith to set them free 
farewell 
and good luck 
hurry up  come over 
there will be trouble 
the women  especially the wives 
will reject this woman 
she is a slave from sodom 
i ll be in front of the
altar of the tabernacle
to point out the duty
to hospitality 
thank you 
we dressed them
as you ordered 
she is dissatisfied
with the clothes 
but she ll get used to it
  how we all got used to it 
  thank you 
as you ordered 
well  don t you even
want to admire your work 
a noble robe
and so supple to the skin 
do you like it better
than the silk robe 
for the purpose
it s supposed to serve  yes 
for what purpose  a bird has
colorful feathers to attract others 
look at that 
  i think you will agree with me 
  not at all 
women wear clothes as protection
from the sun  from the cold 
that explains the shape of your clothes 
you hebrews
confuses clothes with tents 
you sit loosely so that it
does not interfere with your work 
  which one 
  women s work 
cooking  spinning  cleaning 
work in the fields 
  and you say you are against slavery 
  that s the way it is 
nevertheless
you ask me to do work 
which i had never to do before 
work is the price of freedom 
the work for yourself 
if you decide for yourself
what and where you want to work 
this is what really sets you free 
if that means a sunburned face
cracked hands 
dirty  rough clothes like this 
i d rather be a slave then 
me too  if it it means delicious smells
and silk clothes 
just feel it  soft like angel wings 
and those lovely shoes 
you will need them 
how can you show yourself like that 
what would your mother have said 
what would she have said if she
had seen the woman in our tent 
we know
why you recorded it 
a man
who has lost his wife 
  doesn t have to be ashamed about it 
  insolence 
you forgot
that your father is the master 
i ve learned that the lord
never does anything wrong 
run  run  come over
we will protect you 
  stop the sodomites  save the slaves 
  ah 
the network  the network 
get out of here  get lost 
come on 
wait 
give us refuge  protect us 
hand over our slaves 
at the word of your sister
this is our country 
  hand them over 
  no 
stop 
stop fighting 
ishmael  do you want to kill a
defenseless man 
is that what you want  so 
help him 
tell your queen we will
take care of her brother 
until he is ready
to return alone 
bring him to our tent 
tell her too
that these men are now free 
you are under our protection 
now leave our country 
  back to sodom 
  the sodomites will never forgive you for that 
we need not fear them 
we are servants of the lord 
we are here on his behalf 
you should be scared 
the elders and lot
pray to jehovah 
they ask for help with what we are doing 
better to pray for swords 
spears and lances 
you don t get it 
the sodomites are your enemies 
dangerous  unscrupulous 
be careful with this man  no matter
how sweet his words are 
you have to be vigilant 
you think of me a lot  shuah 
right 
no 
not even at night 
not at all 
admit it 
you think of me a lot 
is my skin
still as soft as on that 1st day 
that you anointed me 
does my hair still
smell that sweet 
does your hand still shake
when you touch me 
my father has given orders
to take care of you 
i obey him  nothing more 
not even at night 
tent walls are thin 
and you don t sleep far away 
i hear you 
what you said in a dream 
was very enlightening 
what did i say 
  what did i say 
  should i repeat it 
shall i 
why aren t you
like everyone else 
what is it 
your skin 
the scent of your hair 
why am i doing this 
why can t i stop
feeling this way 
to stop feeling means to die 
you re too young for that 
think about your dream again 
the answer
lies in it 
he didn t tell you
that he wanted to leave 
  no 
  why should he 
you have just been
been a pastime 
you know what ildith looked like
when she came to us 
these are the women
he s used to 
so it will be wide enough 
  so he would have to withstand 
  how long will it take us 
when our men
work like eber
we re
ready for spring ordering 
a surprise
for the queen of sodom 
how delighted she will be when
it turns green and sprouts 
the land of hope
for every slave in sodom 
do you know those roots 
you can find this plant
all over the mountains 
if you cut it 
juice will come out 
which we use to color our nails 
like now 
see 
the more you take
the darker the color 
  what s going on here 
  the girl has feet like an animal 
  i showed her something 
  i can see that 
shuah 
it s late  water the cattle 
my father doesn t want
me to be attractive 
why can t maleb
water the cattle 
should she do your work
in addition  now go on 
my daughters are beautiful enough
as nature created them 
you don t need any decorations 
perhaps
it s the most refined
nothing to be done 
this brown  wind tanned
skin is probably exercising
has a very special charm 
  of which we in sodom just have no idea 
  do you think 
oh 
a clay floor also has advantages 
it would have broken on marble 
this is strange 
huh 
show your other hand 
let s go to the light
so i can see it better 
these are not
the hands of a farmer 
why not 
these are the hands
of a great man 
your lifeline is long and clear 
my lifeline is short 
i e  i will die young 
do you believe in things like that 
why  not you 
we believe
that only god knows our future 
this belief gives
us the power to move mountains 
soon you will see
what our faith can do 
he s transforming this whole country 
when you see this structure
growing towards the sky 
you will share our faith
one day 
  after that nice speech  you want to sleep outside now 
  no 
in ishmael s tent 
i should have figured that out 
it s warm and comfortable here 
too comfortable maybe 
you must be a good
example to the men of the tribe 
even if you wanted to stay here 
you wouldn t dare 
good night 
you are much more a slave to your
faith than any slave in sodom 
although your visit
came as a surprise  prince astaroth 
we have still brought
about this modest show
of our foot and horse troops 
it is certainly
not to be called humble 
the elite
from all of my desert tribes 
watch the cavalry troops
ride through the warriors 
an example
of good horse control 
the attack
of a well led cavalry force
beats the best foot troops 
you re supposed to
ride for another hour 
  i don t understand why you are not acting 
  patience 
  your sister has new allies 
  allies 
the hebrews live in tents of
skins  the men are unarmed 
you would even have taken
the queen s brother off the horse 
coincidence 
they are a peaceful people 
anyway  i want
to get an idea of myself first
from this peaceful people 
every thing
needs the right time 
i have trained leopards 
after pulling on the halter
i can judge
when the animal is ready to jump 
this moment has not yet arrived 
i ll wait 
to me 
ah 
please  please 
you promised me one 
you are way too slow 
that s it now 
  have you seen my brother 
  no  my mistress 
well  in a nutshell 
we must
always be ready
and bring more and more fighters
to our side 
if the attack occurs 
we must stab in the back
of the forces of the queen 
what a pretty sight 
how pleased is my heart 
so many of my loyal subordinates 
so convinced of our
warlike strength to see
that they can afford
to spend their time playing
my father s favorite game 
and so sensible 
you play
in front of your remains 
with this you prove him
and our other ancestors
an extremely dignified
and tasteful honor 
get out 
we weren t idle 
no  a little more precisely  please 
have your confidants established
  what pleasure hebrews seek in this quarry 
  yes 
before you came i said
that these granite blocks 
that have troubled us
are destined for a temple 
with whom they want to make their god
friendly 
i want to know exactly 
here  your first request for salt 
you have to sign a
deposit for every grain 
you may find
some useful help in ildith 
ask her what the hebrews build 
a visit to the hebrew camp 
how pretty 
yes  lot s young daughter 
there are times
in which i envy you men
for your freedom of action 
  for nothing else 
  for many things 
like you 
you alone 
maybe you know very well 
the brother is cute 
oldest and dearest of my enemies 
  that was down to the blood 
  here 
you no longer enjoy it 
not even pain 
go  carry out my orders 
anything you want
sweetest sister 
ah 
the sodomites believe we are building
a temple in honor of jehovanh 
for jehovah  no  my one
pagan temple  i fear 
for fertility 
come on  come on  we bring the salt
your leaders asked for 
we also bring things that
will make your life easier 
soft sleeping beds
and blankets made of wool 
metal bowls
and ornate ornaments 
with which you can make your hut more
beautiful than that of your neighbors 
good afternoon 
aren t you happy
to see me again 
tell me  does this lot
dislike you 
as far as i can tell  yes 
good 
what do the hebrews build 
i have had no reason
to find out 
  it s your job 
  why 
tell me that 
you are only here to
keep your eyes open for us
and to seduce lot into our habits 
to convert him  how malek
converts women to our ways 
tell your sister 
i don t know anything 
if i knew something
i d keep it to myself 
you know my sister
doesn t appreciate unkind words very much 
she sent me away 
i do not belong to your sister any more 
i m free  i can do what i like 
i belong to myself 
congratulations on this possession 
shuah 
the bird you are looking for
is in hiding 
in the tall reeds 
thank you 
there is something touching
about your loyalty to lot 
are you hiding from me 
am i a stranger  are you angry
because i left without saying goodbye 
you don t want to show yourself 
good 
that makes the game more exciting 
i have to find your lead 
you leave traces  on purpose 
you want it that way 
so that i can follow you 
and find you 
even for a mediocre hunter
it s easy
following a trail in the reeds 
best shuah 
you know that very well 
i ll find the lead 
and i ll find you 
what do you need so much for  melchior 
why so much 
  you wanted me to find you 
  no 
  you wanted it  admit it 
  no  no 
salt is meant for everyone 
it s free 
like the air  like the water 
on behalf of the elders  nako
will sign for all of us 
and you  go now 
  go 
  ah  lot 
lot  lot 
astaroth  shuah 
i wasn t vigilant 
forgive me 
down by the reeds 
  leave me 
  why don t you want to 
  am i being too gentle with you 
  no 
you dog 
get out of here 
leave me my pleasure or die 
so kill me 
you will not return
to sodom alive 
no 
  you want me to spare him 
  yes 
for your daughter s sake
i ll spare you 
so our calculation is smooth 
at our next meeting
there will be no more consideration 
grace is not given 
no mercy is asked 
if you touch my daughter again
once  i say 
by jehovanh  i will kill you 
  lot  look 
  what kind of riders are they 
  nomads  helamites 
  perhaps you will see it now 
you d better get out of here 
we will convene the council
and prepare 
our watch is over 
fine  sarah 
  are the backup guards on duty 
  as you ordered 
  on all peaks within earshot of each other 
  good 
we haven t seen anything in days 
you have to give that to the devil 
or the she devil 
she worked like one of us this week 
what a week proves 
they are watching us  i better go 
wait 
look at him  soon she will
have him sweep out her tent 
leave him alone 
lot 
lot  wait 
i have to ask you something 
it s about maleb and me 
  we would like to get married 
  getting married 
not immediately  of course 
in about 6 months 
ishmael 
when a man and a woman
love each other 
they should
not live apart for too long 
i have reasons to wait 
my share of the harvest 
a new household must be started 
you have my blessing 
go and give her a kiss 
  you shouldn t have followed me 
  no 
not in my own tent
in broad daylight 
that s it right now 
all these women by the river 
in 10 minutes you will know in the camp 
the breath of annoyance 
  you have a low opinion of me 
  do you think so 
you make no distinction
between me and my office 
lot  the leader of the tribe
would never do this or that 
neither does man lot 
now the man lot is
standing in front of you 
his heart pounding
like a stupid boy 
he didn t want to go into the tent 
but his feet carried him 
lot 
sun 
let me know
everywhere in the camp 
must i fail
what is
taken for granted by other men 
yes  you have to 
  you must remain a good man to your people 
  a good one 
why not a gloomy one 
grayer  older  more boring 
that s not what i meant 
what does being a good man
have to do with
that i m with you in my tent
please  lot 
please 
has it anything to do with the fact that
you think i m a good man
and you re not a good woman 
because you used
to live in sodom 
you can t even imagine life
in sodom 
this is over 
it has nothing to
do with the now 
look at those hands 
furrowed  sunburned 
these are not the slave s hands
given to me 
these are the hands of a woman
who was born again 
you don t know if it really is 
i don t know 
the hands of the woman
who is now 
the woman 
who shall become my wife 
very well 
why not 
i am brought up to give joy
and to obey 
i can give you joys
that you have never dreamed of 
ildith 
in sodom 
we had fragrant baths 
will you forgive me
if i come to you like this 
without a beguiling scent 
and what a shame that you
took my pretty dress away from me 
i would really like to
be beautiful for you 
but maybe 
i am enough for you 
you may not even
miss the finer points 
i m not looking
for pleasure in you 
i want your love
as i give you mine 
you mustn t love me 
  i want to make you my wife 
  you mustn t love me 
  you mustn t love me 
  why not 
  i don t know 
  my dear wife 
not because of the things
i ve done 
because of
what i may do 
maybe i will never
believe in this jehovanh 
you will 
  maybe i ll never be happy in clothes like that 
  you will 
maybe
something in me will give us away 
and i will wish
to live in sodom again 
i ll take it seriously 
why are you bothering me 
what do you have to tell me 
isn t one favor
always worth another 
didn t melchior show you the way
to lot s daughter 
i intend to do more
favors to you 
maybe
you don t care 
as the first hebrews
who wanted
to become a citizen of sodom 
services rendered
are remembered with benevolence 
future services
we will know how to reward 
we welcome you
to our walls 
open the gates 
  melchior betrayed us 
  do you have anything else to say 
nothing about sodomites  but much about
hebrews who betray us 
  jehovah will cast you out 
  hollow words of an arrogant religion 
i would think you guys are crazy
i would not have seen
what you built 
help  help me 
help me  let go of me 
no  no  leave him alone 
we are not slaves  no 
you ve been so smart  so smart 
you set a trap
and trapped yourself in it 
you persuaded the hebrews to pay
dearly for a desolate piece of land 
what now 
with this dam
that they built
this worthless piece of
land will bring in so much
that they will have
paid for it in 2 years 
now the time is working for you 
my most gracious sister 
but melchior
brought other news too 
well 
that lot should intend to
marry ildith 
you don t think it s important 
it proves to me that the leader
of this invincible people 
is not that insurmountable 
time works for me 
speak 
gentlemen 
the leader of the hebrews  lot 
is waiting with a group
of his advisors 
they wish to speak to you 
i ll talk to him 
but alone 
this is great 
he gives himself into your hand 
in one fell swoop
we can take down lot 
without their ruler
the people are helpless 
and sodom will be without allies 
your eagerness to
serve me moves me 
put down your gun
and wait outside 
why do you always have
to treat me like a child 
i want to be alone with lot 
my brother is having
a fit of hurt pride 
please don t put anything on it 
  you want to reclaim melchior 
  i don t care about traitors 
but where are the former slaves 
that you kidnapped with his help 
for a clear head
  and to calm your nerves 
  where are they 
i want them back 
it is our pleasure to please you 
allow us to make
you comfortable 
you re wasting your time 
i m not here
to be drowned in wine 
i am the leader of the hebrews 
i m here
to discuss important matters
with the ruler of the sodomites 
leave us alone 
you want
that i do not speak as a woman 
but as the ruler of sodom 
then speak as the leader
of the hebrews
and not as a self appointed
prophet of an imaginary deity 
let s tear off our masks 
do you want to see the
slaves that we took back 
come on 
where does he ride to
with such a grim face 
wherever he may go
he will not like it 
our great general s wrath
is aroused 
none of the sinners can evade them 
a man in the free country
is a free man 
if this is not so 
we are not masters of the land 
in that case
we will move on 
who told you
that i wasn t indifferent 
  maybe ildith 
  nobody told me that 
back then you asked
if we would be ready
to fight for this country 
since then i ve assumed
that our presence
fits into your plans 
but maybe
i was wrong 
wait  lot 
i can afford
to be generous 
the 3 recaptured slaves
are to be released 
  you may go back to the hebrews 
  yes  my lady 
and our right to give refuge 
if you insist that it
belongs to the acquisition of the land 
that too 
earlier you refused to
drink with me 
let s drink now to celebrate the
covenant between the good two
enemies 
we re enemies  aren t we 
our peoples  no 
our philosophies of life  yes 
have you discovered a lack of
courage  say your opinion openly 
nothing but bravery  hot blood 
i congratulate you 
but if it is to be done
it must be done now 
you never asked me
for my price 
i know
everything has its price 
for years we nomadic tribes
hat to pay terrible tributes
for the salt of sodom 
now is our time 
half of sodom s total gain in salt 
ok 
the leopard is pulling on its halter 
if i let go of him 
you have to take care of the booty
within the walls 
my sister 
my sister 
i ve waited a long time for such a hunt 
i m so glad you
became my father s wife

lot  lot 
the helamites
have destroyed our camp 
tents  grain  everything burned 
our men are all in their places

to attack where we want 
we have decoys for that

that they are coming towards us

your message 
victory 
triumphant victory 
dangerous  that s what
you called the hebrews 
my dear bodyguard 
have you not been
privileged to protect me 
get water and bandages
for the wounded 
between sodom and the world 
hebrews only 
quiet 
the queen wants to speak to you 
hebrews and sodomites 
i greet you 
our city s hospitality
awaits the winners 
you too  brave lot 
and all your people 
the city awaits you with food and drink
and with everything
brave men dream of 
charities 
mild sheaves from the sodomites 
we can take sodom
and free the slaves 
give us the order to attack
and we ll burn sodom
to the walls 
no 
we ll have to accept it 
we have no other choice 
hear me  queen 
we accept the hospitality
offered to us 
but only until our burned down
camp is rebuilt 
come on 
i ll take care of the wounded 
 0 lord jehovanh 
give me a sign 
that i have done well
in your face 
that i
made the right choice 
show me the right way
and show me what to do 
to serve you humbly 
  where can we get water 
  maybe there 
try this  i ll look here 
maleb 
our work is ruined 
washed away by the same water 
which we believed
would be a blessing to us 
this water
will grow new fruit 
lot 
the water 
  salt 
  this land is cursed 
i don t think so 
i don t think so at all 
a mountain of salt 
the flood and a landslide
exposed the salt 
nothing
grows on our soil anymore 
all of this is on our land 
what use is water to a land
that is poisoned 
death 
  better we go back to where we came from 
  no 
we will accept the offer 
we will live in sodom 
separated from them 
but within the walls of their city 
live in sodom 
that is the sign
i asked for 
jehovah has chosen me to lead my people
away from the fields 
we re going to trade 
weigh honestly  measure well 
the sodomite tyranny
is over 
merchants who avoided sodom
will come 
we ll have paid our land
in a year 
what are we going to sell 
salt 
and so it happened
that the hebrews lived within the walls
of sodom and gomorranh 
you had given up your simple life
as farmers and shepherds
and had become a salt trader 
  to pay for our land or for you 
  to free slaves 
quiet please 
it is the hour when judge lot
will hold his midday meal 
come back tomorrow 
he will listen to your concerns 
lot never used to stop working
just to eat 
the hardworking
tastes better with a crust of bread
than a rich meal for the lazy 
lot said in those days that
salt was as free as air 
now we re going to sell it for gold 
the tax i collected
in one day 
this is how we
pay the queen our land 
we sell so much because we
ask a fair price 
the sodomite slaves
are whipped for it 
you have to work faster and faster 
lot has won a great victory 
now he brings you riches 
us righteousness 
could it be that we sodomites
think more of him than you do 
  we admire your lot 
  you admire him  we love him 
our love obliges us
to remind him
that he is a servant of jehovah 
  your anger is immeasurable  ishmael 
  how else is anger supposed to be 
if you could say
what you hope to achieve
with such ruthless trade 
don t you get it 
it can t go on like this 
you mean we should openly
break with the sodomites 
  they wouldn t know 
  what is it about 
we have the queen s word 
that in hebrew dwellings
every slave enjoys protection 
you are going to cheat the queen
of her property 
property 
are flesh and blood  people
suddenly your property 
how have you changed 
i am a man of peace 
i must respect the way of life
of my neighbors 
what they have acquired
we cannot steal 
if we do
our presence
loses any moral basis 
the reason for our presence
is to free the slaves 
we are in sodom to win
the people over to decency 
while slaves perish 
you should know what it
means to be a slave in sodom 
tell him 
a work slave  what do i know 
i ve never been anything like that 
i believe your freedom
is not that important
like our peace with sodom 
ishmael  i command you
to do nothing
without my consent 
then why do we live here 
is it that hard to understand 
if we continue to rise in the respect
of the sodomites 
one day we shall
obtain everything by law 
rightfully 
you would put all of that
at risk through a rash act 
they change us more than we do them 
their depravity infects us 
look around here  your clothes 
this food  this house 
we live in a nicer house 
because the elders
wished it 
and shuah  who paints her face 
and barely comes home 
and my maleb 
who avoids my gaze 
  is that true 
  shuah spends her time like other girls 
as for maleb 
if you thought of them as much
as you thought of the slaves 
if there were no difficulties
between you 
how can you judge innocence 
if you want to accuse me or my wife
of any wrongdoing 
bring it before the eiders 
the elders 
forgive him 
he s angry with me 
he doesn t realize how close
we are to success 
without us having to use force 
  did lot hear you 
  heard yes 
that s all we expect 
he refuses to act 
the queen once told me
between the hebrews and the world
there would be only sodom 
do you think so too 
yes  i do 
who do you think is the most
powerful hebrew right now 
my uncle  abraham 
and should you convert sodom 
who would be the most powerful then 
lot 
i would be so proud of you 
  proud 
  mhm 
if that happened
then it would be jehovah s will 
i m nothing more
than his tool 
his tool 
no 
it would be the credit of loft 
the man 
you
still don t understand 
you lack true faith 
that all the great things
that you do
are not your credit
and you owe it only to this
invisible jehovah 
there are sure to be times when you know
whose achievement it really is 
does your former
slave confuse you 
  does she annoy you 
  no 
but i care about you 
if we should face hardship
and dangers again 
then you are lost without faith 
then i ll be lost 
i can t believe in something
that i can t see 
hardship and poverty
i ll never endure again 
i know that  never again 
but i don t need that either 
because you protect me 
isn t that enough
for now 
that i believe in you 
your sister maleb 
no 
no 
no  i just don t think so 
because it makes you
angry  because of this 
maleb is too young 
too innocent 
too cute to be so spoiled 
as i was 
younger yes 
and maybe 
maybe too
sweet 
you are lying 
if that s true 
if you loved her too 
  why should you tell me 
  why not 
didn t i succeed
to make you jealous 
just admit it 
you re jealous 
if only i knew 
if only i knew 
  what difference does it make 
  she s my sister 
well then  then you now have
even more in common 
also with the other hebrew who
treasures our sodom  your father 
my father is good 
  he is perfect 
  did i say something else 
he married a woman of ours 
led your tribe into town 
what makes you different from him 
or maleb 
or me 
do i remember your father 
captain 
step closer 
do you prefer the captain 
he s very beautiful 
right 
would you rather kiss him 
come on 
don t be afraid 
come on 
kiss him 
go ahead 
isn t she beautiful 
answer me 
come on  take her in your arms 
answer me 
i thought
years of loyalty to you
deserves at least respect 
respect for a hypocritical dog
that wags its tail 
he goes and thinks
he s betraying me 
the queen already
knows everything 
i m close to death 
those tears 
for you or me 
for maleb 
i ll make you
very happy tonight 
look  the dancer here 
  the one next to it is better 
  the other one is more graceful 
give me some rest 
pay attention  silence please 
i ask for silence on the queen 
my loyal subjects 
old citizens of this city
and new ones 
on the faithful keeping
of the word of the hebrews 
which
is confirmed to us once again today 
by making the final payment
on their land 
to your great
esteemed colonel  lot 
the first against the helamites 
the first in righteousness 
whom i hereby appoint as my
personal advisor 
to the highest dignitary of sodom 
my eternal gratitude
to the queen of sodom 
to peace and friendship 
may she rule forever
between the sodomites and the hebrews 
just like the queen
over both peoples 
  are the guards 
  shh 
  how many are guarding the camp 
  2  the slaves are ready 
make way 
the gates open inward 
back  you won t get out like that 
make way  return 
make way  move out of the way 
push them back 
ishmael  this way 
if i were to do you an important service 
would you give me the
position that was due to me back 
how about you do me
the service and then ask 
there was a time
your wife
was such a good dancer too 
slaves  escaped slaves 
the slaves broke away 
  this way 
  they re going to rob us 
quickly to your houses  hurry up 
  not here 
  take us in 
hebrews  help us 
they are killing us  let us in 
let s get in

arrest them 
they are trying to free slaves 
  tell them to be silent 
  listen 
listen  silence please 
a couple of ex slaves
have attempted
to help their friends
to escape 
don t worry 
thanks to the loyalty of our
new hebrew citizens
they and their treacherous
patrons could be caught 
show them in 
forward 
  get the fire wheel ready 
  no  lot  help us 
no 
as the leader of the hebrews
i invoke our right
to give refuge 
your people
have refused them refuge 
they slammed the doors before us 
they have turned us over
to the guards 
that man over there is a hebrew 
if he broke the law 
i claim the right to
punish him 
whatever you want  into jail 
  he may wait what lot decides 
  no 
i want to stay with them 
i want to stay with them 
and as for the others 
your punishment will be
a welcome relief for us 
save us  lot 
neither i nor my people
approve of such a spectacle 
maybe
you will ask your people first 
i don t hear any protest 
they seem to think that
the sentence is deserved 
  take them away 
  rise up  hebrews 
you are stronger than them 
don t let it happen 
rise up  save the slaves 
save them 
  save them 
  what are you waiting for  lot 
save them 
lot  save us  don t watch
them kill us 
lot  save us 
help us  lot 
hebrews  help us 
hebrews  do not let them
kill us 
how can you expect them
to defend slaves 
if you know
that you do not even defend
the virtue of your family 
your wife 
your wife 
which has been
one of ours and will be again 
she knew it 
but she kept it from you 
don t listen to him  he grudges you
the queen s esteem 
he s going to
set a trap for you 
she protects
your daughter shuah 
you vowed to kill the
man who stole her innocence 
i d do it 
then kill me 
read the truth from her face 
and the other one  maleb 
that you think
is an innocent angel 
avenge her too

challenge you

i won t let that happen 
congratulations  lot 
how delicious it is to kill 
to see
how life flows out of the body 
and knowing i did that 
why 
why 
he begged for mercy 
did he have mercy on you 
or with maleb 
in the name of jehovah i punished him 
in jehovah s name
you also led us through the desert 
in jehovah s name
you brought us to sodom too 
you wanted to flatter your vanity 
your arrogance 
but he did believe that
jehovah had hallowed his sword 
and he would have the right
to kill an evil man 
he had the right 
as the highest dignitary of sodom
he is the law 
what about the helamites 
the helamite warriors
were already defeated 
but you destroyed the dam
and drowned them down to the last man 
you murdered them 
in the name of justice 
and in the name of your god 
you gave yourself over to the
bloodlust with zeal and lust 
you are a real sodomite  lot 
welcome 
no 
  no 
  take a look at your hebrews 
take a look at them 
behind the exciting pleasure
of killing
the pleasure of watching is coming soon 
you enjoyed every moment
of the bloody spectacle 
you have converted
the chosen people  lot 
to sodom 
i killed 
what does hebrew law say about this 
don t fall into her trap 
be careful 
how would you judge such a murderer
judge lot 
now speak  judge lot 
we wait for your words 
i would sentence him to the dungeon 
for the rest of his life 
don t be
thrown into the dungeon  fight 
fight  lot 
your people want to help you 
believe me  they will help you 
justice is an empty word 
fight if you love me 
don t you understand  you
had the right to kill him 
if you love me
i beg you

lot 
lot 
lot  lot 
what happened 
why are you here 
what did they do to you 
lot 
lot 
no 
no 
no 
faster  more quickly 
o lord god jehovah 
help me 
how could i get so lost
and cause so much damage 
where i only wanted good 
i have tempted my people 
that no one can resist 
i did that with your name on my lips 
but in my heart there was pride 
and now it s too late 
the queen is right 
if we re all as sinful
as she says 
let s destroy one another 
for we re not worth it 
may we be wiped out
from the face of the earth 
i ask you  my lord and god 
is there nothing
in our hearts of yours 
answer me 
if there s anything else in us
fighting for life 
in the midst of death and damnation 
give him your ear 
speak to me  jehovah 
let me know
if we are worth surviving 
do we have a right to live 
we re bringing you a message 
jehovah s wrath
is upon these cities 
for they
have corrupted his chosen people 
in their sinfulness
would sodom and gomorrah
bring death and perdition
to all of god s creatures 
you have to go away  lot 
you have to lead your people
away from here 
at sunset
will be the lord s vengeance
and destroy sodom and gomorrah
and everything that lives there 
i fervently thank jehovah for finding
us worth saving 
to be his tool on earth 
but will the lord
destroy all the sodomites  all 
guilty and innocent 
the innocent had enough time
to stand up against the guilty 
and have not done if 
but jehovah is gracious 
should he find 50 righteous here 
does he not spare the
place for their sake 
then look for these 50 righteous ones 
if there are that
many among the sodomites 
40 for sure 
jehovah does not destroy 40
righteous people with sinners 
not even 30 
but not 20 or 10 
if i can make it  among the
sodomites there are only 10 righteous
found before sunset 
wouldn t he spare the rest 
jehovah will spare all others for
the sake of 10 righteous people 
but if the 10 do not exist 
he will born these cities with everything
that is in its walls to the ground 
remember  lot 
if some of those that you

in my arrogance
i wanted to punish myself 
but now i know
someone else is going to punish me
according to his will 
melchior 
we have to get out of this place 
  isn t it better to stay 
  no 
but we wanted
to convert the sodomites 
hold on  on behalf of the queen 
let us through 
now don t be a fool 
  i have my orders 
  he s going to kill you 
in the name of jehovanh 
my eyes 
my eyes 
we must tell our people
what we saw 
stop it 
  stop the wheel 
  stop the wheel 
they are dead 
the pleasure is over 
make way for the noble judge 
or should it just start 
friends 
hebrews 
these cities are cursed 
we have to leave
before the sun goes down 
guard 
  get hold of this man 
  no 
make way for him 
let him speak 
this will be entertaining 
lot  what do you
think of the fire wheel 
these cities will disappear
from the face of the earth 
crumble to dust 
hebrews  listen to me 
i brought you here
and tolerated
that you were corrupted
by an evil people 
but the lord
in his mercy
wants to save us one more time 
come on  follow me 
get out of this awful place 
a miracle

look  the sun 
it s already low 
we only have so much
time left until it goes down 
why not burn him 
he s insane  insane 
he can t harm us 
you citizens of sodom and gomorrah 
if there are 10 of you
who come with us 
at least 10  then jehovah
will show mercy for their sake
and spare their cities 
only 10 
10 who still
believe in life 
and not death 
don t laugh 
i beg you  follow me 
avenger of my lost innocence 
now jehovah s personal ambassador 
be glad he s free

goes unusual ways 
who knows what he s really thinking
what he s really up to 
you  come with me 
before it is too late 
leave me alone 
can t you see that i
am comfortable here 
god offers you the last opportunity to
turn his anger away from you 
renounce your unnatural pleasures 
  come on 
  lot 
you defeated the helamites 
freed me from my brother 
and now you want to leave 
want to leave sodom 
which is richer in salt
than it was when you arrived 
please  go 
if 10 of my people
want to go with you 
they should do it 
avoid torture 
think for the good of your people 
what you call sin
is virtue to me 
the mighty death that you
detest is my friend 
i have my back
on you  lot 
you and your feeble god 
clouds  lightning  you teach your
people to fear such cheap miracles 
my people don t leave sodom out of fear 
but for faith in god 
faith in him
who is mighty enough
to appear to us in
the shadow of a cloud 
whose voice in the thunder
can speak to us 
take a long look at this sun 
  you ll never see her again 
  not until tomorrow morning 
follow me 
hebrews  have faith 
pray 
listen to the elders 
a hot wind from the desert 
a storm is approaching 
this is going to be beautiful 
come with me 
follow me 
is it true
that sodom is going to be destroyed
