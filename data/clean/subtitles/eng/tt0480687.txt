 really 
twenty s old enough to  um   
 vote

    with one of the most beautiful women 
fred  on speaker   six grand 
i ve gotta have a way to get

flats  completely harmless 
one time thing  what would you pay 
 i honestly don t know 
 ballpark  please 
well  i have a great wife   
   so i wouldn t wanna do anything
to hurt her feelings 
rick  on speaker  
so i guess the real question becomes   
   what wouldn t i pay 
 all laughing   shouting 
flats 
that s why this dude  s wearing the hat 
this house has gotta be
worth something  right 
 all laugh 
rick  now  mother in laws 
what do they go for on the black market 
fifty bucks  maybe 
fred said 6 grand 
oh  god  what a douche bag 
he won t even spend  60 on an evening
with kathy griffin tickets for me   
   but he s gonna give some
make believe genie 6 g s  
 wanna near something funnier 
 yeah 
hog head mccormick said 7500 
 wow 
 what 
look  i mean  on the bright side 
they re not cheating on us  right 
 although that d be kind of fun to watch 
lucy  ha  ha 
i d love to see the look
on the girl s face   
   when she wakes up next to fred
with his sleep apnea mask on 
 maggie laughs 
are you kidding 
he wears one of those things   
    with the mask and the tube 
 yeah  it s awful 
that is attractive 
every time i wake up 
i think a plane s going down 
 all laugh 
you know  sometimes i wonder
if it wouldn t be better if they did cheat 
just got it over with 
you mean rather than take
the slow boat to resentment 
i m just saying  maybe a little freedom
would be good for them  and for you 
have you ever considered giving
him a hall pass 
 a what 
 a hall pass  a week off from marriage 
 no 
 heh 
wait a minute  are you saying
let them go out and cheat 
i m saying  give them a week off
from marriage 
look  most married men have very
foggy memories of their single days   
   and they begin to believe
that if not for you   
   they could be with these other women 
that s fred 
i mean  he thinks
because he sees big tits all day long   
   and he manages to make it home
without squeezing one   
   that i should be greeting him
at the door like some hero 
maybe it s time to let them
go out there and find out what it s like 
 huh 
lucy  it s called the reactance theory 
it s a principle in psychology
which says   
   that if you constantly tell someone
they can t do something   
   they just want to do it
more than ever 
conversely  if you remove the taboo 
you remove the obsession 
you know what  i have an idea  doc 
why don  t you let your husband have a
hall pass and let us know how it turns out 
oh  i have 
are you telling us you let charlie
sleep with another woman 
i m not telling you that  i gave him
the freedom to choose for himself 
and 
all i know is our marriage
is better than ever 
all right 
here  i ll get it  i ll get it  watch 
watch  watch  watch 
 oh  wow  look at this place 
 pretty good  huh 
ed  hey 
 there he is  the lord of the manor 
you see the prius  we re going green 
i can see that 
ed 
everybody in the shack 
 the grand tour s about to begin 
 come on 
i call it headquarters 
and behind that wall  the war room 
a 300 square foot humidor 
the humidity in there never gets above
71 percent and never below 70 
oh  unbelievable 
how does he come up with this stuff  huh 
aw  thank you  mandy 
i threw in a backup generator   
   in case we lose power
and the main genny doesn t kick in 
it s absolutely epic  ed 
who wants a cubano  huh 
oh  wait a second  eddie 
first i want to show them my headquarters 
 come  come 
 everybody upstairs 
hey  larry  i ll get you a cigar  come on 
 all chattering 
i can t stand these look at how much i own
parties  they re obnoxious 
when i got my fully loaded honda odyssey 
i didn t go around bragging about it  did i 
well  kind of  you made me drive
around town for two hours  remember 
well  i thought you d like
to watch a movie in a minivan 
 you never watched a movie in a minivan 
 no 
but did you have
to hook your boat up to it 
yeah  yeah  it s a touring edition  dick 
fridge  sub zero 
the floors are french limestone
and the counter tops are brazilian granite 
it s my paradise 
with a price tag north of 240 large 
it better be paradise 
 whispers 
see  this is why the terrorists hate us 
oh  i love brazilian granite 
how come i don t have brazilian granite 
if you recall  we had to make a couple of
fairly substantial expenditures  remember 
hey  gang  check this out 
oh  honey  don t show them that 
they re gonna think we re wackos 
ed 
sweetie  don t keep me down 
 what the hell is this 
 get in here  you re gonna love this 
hey  where are the guys 
maggie 
wow  this is like secret agent stuff 
i think a safe room is a bit over the top 
ed thought with the little ones
you can never be too cautious 
oh  you re such a good daddy 
fred  on screen  
no  i disagree 
here comes tweedledee
and tweedledum 
who gets a minivan
when they don t have any kids 
fred  wow  man  you just don t understand
the insurance game  do you  rick 
rick  ah  enlighten me 
 when you pull into a person s driveway   
   to sell them insurance 
who do you think they d rather see 
some knucklehead hotshot
in a convertible sebring   
   or a family man in a minivan 
where is everybody  hello

to the war room  old chap 
by the way  did i mention that my wife s
vagina never goes above 71  humidity 
 chuckling 
 um  maybe we should turn this off 
 not a chance 
rick  in british accent   what happens
if you lose power during a blow   
   and your main generator drops out 
fred  that s why we had the backup
genny installed in britney s rumpus 
 here we go 
rick  on screen   ah  good show 
 in the rumpus 
fred  right inside 
rick 
and there  s room in there with the stick 
fred 
we had to rotate the stick a little 
rick  but then it gives you a little room
to get it up there 
fred  absolutely 
can wedge anything in that ass 
rick  in normal voice  
ha ha ha  your english accent s great 
fred  in normal voice  
thank you 
speaking of installations   
   what about the shiny new set of cans
on mandy 
mandy  oh

rick  i like being able to get in there
and smoosh them

driving in a car with you is like being
with a horny bobblehead 
i notice women  i notice all women 
i do  and you wanna know why

okay  but we re not talking about
cats here  we are talking about dogs 
ha  ha  well  what choice do we have 
i don t know  i mean  why couldn t we
just keep the status quo 
were things that bad that we have
to do something this extreme 
for me they were 
remember when we went
to lucy s award thing 
 yeah 
 well  that night rick and i were gonna   
    you know 
 yeah 
i started wondering  who is he gonna
be thinking about when we re having sex 
is it gonna be that girl
that he checked out   
   or is it gonna be somebody
he met that day or missy frankinopoulos 
gr some frankinopoulos monster where he
combines his favorite parts of all of them 
 so when he came into the room     
 what 
i pretended to be asleep 
 snorts 
you re kidding  you don t  
you ve never done that before 
i do that all the time 
 really 
grace  yes 
i think it s our job as women that
between the hours of 10 p m  and 6 a m   
   we just fake everything 
 ha  ha  well  i don t know  i

 i ll go round up the kids 
 what are you doing

those guys are still in college 
and in case you forgot  we re married 
uh  to who  because you know what 
the last that i checked   
   rick and fred had the week off

   so remind me again 
who are we married to 
well  i guess one beer won t kill us 
now  that s my girl 
come on  why can t we have some fun 
god knows our guys are living it up 
what would you rather 
make out with a guy or let him blow you 
and you gotta pick one or your
whole family will die  that s the rule 
fred 
mm hm  mm hm 
 how long would you have to make out 
 ten minutes 
 tongue 
 of course 
how long would you have to
let him blow you 
 seven minutes 
 seven 
couldn t last seven minutes 
this is tricky because  obviously  getting
a blow job from a guy  you know  is bad   
    but i don t know 
 oh 
making out with him
is just so intimate  isn t it 
what does he do for a living 
just out of interest 
okay  look  this is some bullshit  okay

i wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks 
not talk about dicks 
whoa  greased lightning  take your foot

 rock music playing on console

ask them to come home 
wait a second  you wanna quit 
fred  come on  we re not the same guys
we were 15 years ago when we were single 
we ve changed 
 fred scoffs

all you re thinking about is yourself 
i don t care  i m exhausted 
i wanna go home 
 motorcycle crashes on screen 
 i miss my wife and kids  okay 
fred  no 
no  no  no 
let me explain something to you  okay 
if maggie and grace find out that we
can t get laid on our own   
   they ll start thinking that we need
them to get laid 
do you realize what that ll do to the
balance of power in our homes  do you 
ahh  yeah 
maybe we just say that we did hook up 
i can t  grace will know i m lying 
she always knows when i m lying 
and she doesn t forget 
i once got caught giving her fake chow
and i didn t hear the end of it for years 
 what s fake chow 
 when you re going south on them   
   and don t wanna use your tongue 
so you use fingers and smack your lips 
 smacking 
 fake chow 
 gotcha 
 what if we hit a massage parlor 
 no way  that is giving up 
you don t get it  do you 
if we can t show something positive
can come from having a hall pass   
   then the whole concept is dead 
not just for you and me 
but for all mankind 
 sighs 
okay  let s get out of here

 cheering   rock music playing 
man

meg  whoo 
 wow 
so  rick  how s the week off
from marriage going 
you don t mind if i call you rick 
i am officially an adult now 
no  sure  but what did you just say 
i was asking you about that hall pass thing 
i babysat for the putneys last night 
i heard mr  putney talking about it 
gary was talk  
who was he talking about it to 
 just everyone at the barbecue 
 what 
oh  i don t think he meant it
in a bad way 
i actually think it s cool of you to be
staying at the comfy nite inn   
   instead of bringing girls back to your
home with the kids  pictures all taped up 
thank you 
 what can i get you 
 can i get three tequila shots  please 
by the way  i think that i owe you
an apology 
last week when you drove me home 
i shouldn t have snapped at you like that 
no  no  no  don t be ridiculous 
it was just a misunderstanding 
no  it wasn t 
if you thought that i was
kind of coming on to you   
   it s probably because i kind of was 
 fifty seven bucks 
 what  are you kidding me  that  
that seems a little stiff 
they re just kids in here 
i don t see how they afford these prices 
 paige  i better get going 
 what  where are you going 
paige  you re my kids  babysitter 
have a happy birthday 
but my aunt meg wants to meet you 
 akron familly s
 everyone is guilty  playing

she just quit cigarettes 
how do you know 
because she can t take her eyes
off the smokers over there 
fred  how do you know
those aren t her friends 
 come on  coakley  give me a break 
 well  that might be plausible   
   if her lips weren t shaking   
   and her fingernails weren t chewed
down to the nub 
and that bag  man 
that s a little big to be bringing into a club 
unless she needs room
for a  5 foot long 
 so you got a woman who quit smoking 
 right 
she s tense  she s hungry 
and it all adds up to what 
that woman needs something
in her mouth 
aah  that s my boy  let s go

it was  like  a long shot 
and miraculously  it came through 
and then we had kids 
emma  gunnar and mac 
and that s their spot  when they re
brand new they d sleep right here 
when it d be 4 in the morning
you d be holding their head   
   because their little necks don t have

and it doesn t matter
how beautiful you are
