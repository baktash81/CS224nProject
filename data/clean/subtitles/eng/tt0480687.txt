to hurt her feelings
rick on speaker

what wouldnt i pay
all laughing  shouting
flats
thats why this dude s wearing the hat
this house has gotta be
worth something right
all laugh
rick now motherinlaws
what do they go for on the black market
fifty bucks maybe
fred said 6 grand
oh god what a douche bag
he wont even spend 60 on an evening
with kathy griffin tickets for me
but hes gonna give some
makebelieve genie 6 gs
wanna near something funnier
yeah
hoghead mccormick said 7500
wow
what
look i mean on the bright side
theyre not cheating on us right
although thatd be kind of fun to watch
lucy ha ha
id love to see the look
on the girls face
when she wakes up next to fred
with his sleep apnea mask on
maggie laughs
are you kidding
he wears one of those things
with the mask and the tube
yeah its awful
that is attractive
every time i wake up
i think a planes going down
all laugh
you know sometimes i wonder
if it wouldnt be better if they did cheat
just got it over with
you mean rather than take
the slow boat to resentment
im just saying maybe a little freedom
would be good for them and for you
have you ever considered giving
him a hall pass
a what
a hall pass a week off from marriage
no
heh
wait a minute are you saying
let them go out and cheat
im saying give them a week off
from marriage
look most married men have very
foggy memories of their single days
and they begin to believe
that if not for you
they could be with these other women
thats fred
i mean he thinks
because he sees big tits all day long
and he manages to make it home
without squeezing one
that i should be greeting him
at the door like some hero
maybe its time to let them
go out there and find out what its like
huh
lucy its called the reactance theory
its a principle in psychology
which says
that if you constantly tell someone
they cant do something
they just want to do it
more than ever
conversely if you remove the taboo
you remove the obsession
you know what i have an idea doc
why don t you let your husband have a
hall pass and let us know how it turns out
oh i have
are you telling us you let charlie
sleep with another woman
im not telling you that i gave him
the freedom to choose for himself
and
all i know is our marriage
is better than ever
all right
here ill get it ill get it watch
watch watch watch
oh wow look at this place
pretty good huh
ed hey
there he is the lord of the manor

rick and fred are like a couple of
domesticated cats scratching at the door
grace ha ha
the first time you let them out
they are so paralyzed with fear
they bolt back into the house
okay but were not talking about
cats here we are talking about dogs
ha ha well what choice do we have
i dont know i mean why couldnt we
just keep the status quo
were things that bad that we have
to do something this extreme
for me they were
remember when we went
to lucys award thing
yeah
well that night rick and i were gonna
you know
yeah
i started wondering who is he gonna
be thinking about when were having sex
is it gonna be that girl
that he checked out
or is it gonna be somebody
he met that day or missy frankinopoulos
gr some frankinopoulos monster where he
combines his favorite parts of all of them
so when he came into the room
what
i pretended to be asleep
snorts
youre kidding you dont
youve never done that before
i do that all the time
really
grace yes
i think its our job as women that
between the hours of 10 pm and 6 am
we just fake everything
ha ha well i dont know i
gerry hey

go falmouth ha ha
gerry ha ha

grace

im not old enough to have kids
come on guys come on lets go
lets pick it up
eddie what am i your slave

maggie ha ha hey dad

werent bothering you
oh no they were sweet
yeah no no those were cute kids

beer and brats join us
yeah
no we have to get the kids home
go go have some fun
you havent been out all week
your mother and i have the kids
weve got paige no problem
i dont know we werent planning on
come on its gonna be fun
were gonna have a bellyflop contest
in the pool you all can be judges
maggie ha ha uh

great let me clean up
and you can follow me over
great
ill go round up the kids
what are you doing
huh
those guys are still in college
and in case you forgot were married
uh to who because you know what
the last that i checked
rick and fred had the week off
from marriage
so remind me again
who are we married to
well i guess one beer wont kill us
now thats my girl
come on why cant we have some fun
god knows our guys are living it up
what would you rather
make out with a guy or let him blow you
and you gotta pick one or your
whole family will die thats the rule
fred
mmhm mmhm
how long would you have to make out
ten minutes
tongue
of course
how long would you have to
let him blow you
seven minutes
seven
couldnt last seven minutes
this is tricky because obviously getting
a blow job from a guy you know is bad
but i dont know
oh
making out with him
is just so intimate isnt it
what does he do for a living
just out of interest
okay look this is some bullshit okay
im out of here man
i wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks
not talk about dicks
whoa greased lightning take your foot
off the gas these things take time
nah flats is right this is day three
you guys havent even talked to a girl
thats not true
thanks to garys brownies
i was talking to judy on the drug hotline
most of last night
im gonna get going as well guys
see you later
guys its all right if you strike out
for gods sakes
at least take a couple of swings
rock music playing on console
maybe we should just call the girls
ask them to come home
wait a second you wanna quit
fred come on were not the same guys
we were 15 years ago when we were single
weve changed
fred scoffs
no no youve changed
all youre thinking about is yourself
i dont care im exhausted
i wanna go home
motorcycle crashes on screen
i miss my wife and kids okay
fred no
no no no
let me explain something to you okay
if maggie and grace find out that we
cant get laid on our own
theyll start thinking that we need
them to get laid
do you realize what thatll do to the
balance of power in our homes do you
ahh yeah
maybe we just say that we did hook up
i cant grace will know im lying
she always knows when im lying
and she doesnt forget
i once got caught giving her fake chow
and i didnt hear the end of it for years
whats fake chow
when youre going south on them
and dont wanna use your tongue
so you use fingers and smack your lips
smacking
fake chow
gotcha
what if we hit a massage parlor
no way that is giving up
you dont get it do you
if we cant show something positive
can come from having a hall pass
then the whole concept is dead
not just for you and me
but for all mankind
sighs
okay lets get out of here
i know exactly where we should be
not tonight fellas
but there is an oldies bar
up on mineral spring avenue
check that out

from marriage going
you dont mind if i call you rick
i am officially an adult now
no sure but what did you just say
i was asking you about that hallpass thing
i babysat for the putneys last night
i heard mr putney talking about it
gary was talk
who was he talking about it to
just everyone at the barbecue
what
oh i dont think he meant it
in a bad way
i actually think its cool of you to be
staying at the comfy nite inn
instead of bringing girls back to your
home with the kids pictures all taped up
thank you
what can i get you
can i get three tequila shots please
by the way i think that i owe you
an apology
last week when you drove me home
i shouldnt have snapped at you like that
no no no dont be ridiculous
it was just a misunderstanding
no it wasnt
if you thought that i was
kind of coming on to you
its probably because i kind of was
fiftyseven bucks
what are you kidding me that
that seems a little stiff
theyre just kids in here
i dont see how they afford these prices
paige i better get going
what where are you going
paige youre my kids babysitter
have a happy birthday
but my aunt meg wants to meet you
akronfamillys
everyone is guilty playing
all right
yeah getting wasted
whoo mm
the spirits doth floweth
aah
yeah ha ha
fred coughing
that girl over there is looking at you
which one what the one that looks
like chief from cuckoos nest
no no man the one sitting next to her
oh yeah
shes very vulnerable
she just quit cigarettes
how do you know
because she cant take her eyes
off the smokers over there
fred how do you know
those arent her friends
come on coakley give me a break
well that might be plausible
if her lips werent shaking
and her fingernails werent chewed
down to the nub
and that bag man
thats a little big to be bringing into a club
unless she needs room
for a 5 footlong
so you got a woman who quit smoking
right
shes tense shes hungry
and it all adds up to what
that woman needs something
in her mouth
aah thats my boy lets go
now
right now man the universe is calling
i dont know if we need to go now
come on
empire of the suns
walking on a dream playing
