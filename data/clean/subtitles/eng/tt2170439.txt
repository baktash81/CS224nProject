please    welcome
nick  kurt  and dale 
pleasure to be here 
now  um  before we get

can you tell us what is it
that inspired three regular joes
to go into business
for yourselves 
yeah  well  we were   
we were all working
at pretty terrible jobs
for some awful bosses 
and we just thought 
well  if we ever got a chance
to be our own bosses
that we d do things differently 
and this might be our shot 
yeah  yeah 
yeah  so  we didn t think
we d ever get the chance 
but then our buddy dale here
had an amazing idea 
don t go to dale 
uh  yeah 
and  uh  you know  we just
started  uh  meeting together
to talk
about the invention
instead of complaining
about our jobs 
hey  i think that s exciting 
well done 
dale  you know 
i just want to know 
where did
the idea come from
for a new shower    head 
i have three kids 
uh 
let me answer the question 
um  dale  uh

from one of those
self service car washes  right 
with the wand

 the shower daddy  
 shower daddy  is worse on

some strange dude
in the shower with you

about this whole deal   
you re not even gonna have to
lift a finger 
my company will assume
all future product development 
outsource manufacturing
to china 
and you gents will receive
a handsome one time
development fee 
i want to dig in on the one time
fee thing  because  you know   
you see this football 
this is the one
where peyton manning threw it
and the guy caught it in the
back of his helmet  keep it 
oh 
you know  uh  rex 
the    the one time fee thing   
we re not looking to give up
control of the company 
in fact   
right  no  we want to handle
all the manufacturing 
and you guys
do distribution 
what    you manufacture 
here  in america 
that s the plan 
yeah  we re trying to do
the whole american dream thing 
boys  i hate
to break it to you 
but the american dream 
it s made in china 
now  look

to talk to my partners 
you got it  take your time 
i ll be over here 
oh  boy 
yeah 
what do you guys think 
i didn t
want to say anything

and not peyton manning 
you know 
yeah  maybe 
maybe    kurt 
i think she has she has
an amazing fucking body 
but that accent puts her over
the top  i mean  it s insane 
right  agreed on both points 
how about the deal 
the deal  yeah  it s sweet  man 
we got to take it 
oh  yeah  yeah  yeah 
we should take it 
we should take the money
and get the hell out of here 
cool shit

yeah 
can you imagine
having your own cool shit 
but   
but look at this place 
i mean  these guys make
loads of money selling stuff 
and he just called
our shower buddy a home run 
i don t know why we d sell
a home run for a one time fee 
that s a good point 
i don t know  i mean 
i could really use the money
for stacy and the girls 
that s a good point  yeah 
that s true  i could use money 
yeah  i i get that  but maybe
it s not just about the money 
that s a good point 
maybe it s about never having
to work for anybody ever again 
that s right 
right  being our own bosses 
i say we bet on ourselves 
me  too 
you re right 
i m in 
i m in  let s do it

because we re not gonna

come on  this guy s
a master business prick 
he s at the top of his game 
we need to figure out   
boy  look what we got 
is that a sharpie 
well  hang on 
what was a sharpie doing
on there in the first place 
you put it on there 
i did put it on there 
permanently on the board now 
this illustrates my point 
idiots 
we need to find somebody
who s legitimate 
we need to find someone
who can get us our company back 
hello  nick 
guy who saved my life 
guy who
fucked my wife 
ah  it was a blow job 
it was a blow job  only 
didn t fuck her 
you got my e mail 
i did 
and i was very amused by it 
i know bert hanson 
i like the cut of his jib 
and i do admire
the way he bent you three idiots
over a barrel
and showed you the 50 states 
ah  see  told you
it was a saying 
wow 
now  nick  just   
just tell me something 
why would you start production
without at least a guarantee
of 35  down
to cover manufacturing costs 
i mean  why would you do that 
is he telling a joke 
is something funny 
uh  we assumed that
we were dealing with
somebody who was ethical   
no  that s the wrong answer 
the right answer is because   
you re all fucking morons 
boy  he shined a light
on that  didn t he 
yeah  i think   
that s true  you re right 
you re absolutely right 
you thought i was such
a bad boss  but  i don t know 
i think maybe running your
own company into the ground
and ruining the livelihood
of your employees
is maybe a bit worse 
what do you think  nick 
i think that s fair 
should i be on the phone
if i m taking notes 
no  we got it  we got it here 
i mean  i m not getting
any of what he s saying 
it s all right 
it s just a lot of 
you know  rhetorical questions 
okay  i ll just
try to get his reactions 
so  what do you want
from me  nick 
with all due respect  you know
what makes a guy like that tick 
so if you could give us
some advice
on how to get our money back 
i will play real nice
at your next parole hearing 
how does that sound 
you would do that for me 
yes  i would 
okay 
i think i can help you 
he s helping 
he s gonna help 
okay  i got a notepad 
i got a notepad 
from a legal standpoint

to fight him in the courts 
his lawyers are just gonna
file motions and continuances
long after you three
piss ant little fuck ups
have blown your tiny 
little brains out 
are you saying
nothing can be done 
no  i didn t say that  i said
there s nothing you can do 
there s plenty that could be
done  but you won t do it 
and do you want to know why 
no  not really 
because you have no balls 
i see 
okay 
and your fathers had no balls 
you are all the product
of generations of ball less men
who were either too weak
or too frightened
to stand up
and take what was theirs 
and one day  you will pass on
your empty  shriveled sacs
to your own pitiful offspring 
i can t hear a goddamn thing 
what is he talking about 
our    our nut sacs  mostly 
well  how did that come up 
why don t you pitch
him the kidnapping 
no  let the kidnapping go 
all right

i knew he d like it 
told you 
i appreciate the fact
that you re doing
whatever you need to do
to keep your business going 
yes 
i had a dream for a long time
to get my own business 
yeah 
i wanted to open
my own    pinkberry 
what the fuck
is the chuckles about 
oh  i thought
you were joking 
you ain t seen how many crackers
line up outside to get that
captain crunch covered
freezing ass shit 
i probably eat it three times
a week  i love pinkberry 
that s a great dream 
hey  man  that s awesome 
i didn t know that about you 
all i know  if somebody
were to take my pinkberry 
i wouldn t take that
sitting down 
mm hmm 
you would fight
for that pinkberry 
i would cut a motherfucker
in half 
tell you what you wouldn t do 
you wouldn t kidnap someone   
yes  you would 
    cause you can t
successfully pull it off 
that s not true 
name me a kidnapping movie
where the kidnappers weren t
dead or incarcerated at the end 
 nine to five   asshole 
 nine to five  
 nine to five  
name me two 
name me two movies  then 
you said name one 
well  that s a comedy 
you said name one  bam 
i nailed one right on you 
 nine to five 
was this movie   
i know what the fuck
 nine to five  is 
it s about the white bitch
with the big ass titties 
that s the one  yeah 
she got old 
the titties stayed young 
guys  i m not gonna kidnap
someone based on  nine to five  
that s because
you jane fonda 
ooh  snap 
that s right 
you re the scaredy cat one 
you re always the last
to man up about everything 
you re dragging your feet 
can i pose a question
to you colonizers 
happened
a long time ago 
how do you kidnap somebody
without them knowing   
they ve been kidnapped 
okay 
you smarten up 
and you don t even do it 
hey  man  no 
he s a black sphinx 
i like this 
yeah 
he threw a riddle our way 
okay  how do you   
i can give you the answers 
 50 000 
no 
ohh 
we can t 
 600 
you should not run a pinkberry 
i m sorry 
i mean  that s just
the weirdest negotiating style 
we don t have any money 
you know  we re here  cause we
have zero dollars  we re broke 
that s true 
fuck it 
give me the watch 
nope 
give him your watch 
i m not giving him this 
it s a fucking tag heuer 
and this is a wrist
without a watch 
come on  nick  give him   
it s just material things 
can t take it with you 
right 
you can borrow it
while you tell us a shitty plan 
all right 
slip him a mickey 
give me
the watch back 
you sneak into his crib
late at night 
you find out whatever
his beverage of choice is
before he goes to bed  you slip
the mickey in the beverage 
knock him out nice and easy 
and you keep that bitch sedated
until daddy pays up 
wait a second 
that could work 
that s great 
that makes total sense 
yeah  right   cause he
doesn t  like  see our
faces or hear our voices 
we re ghosts 
no  we don t even exist 
when you re saying  mickey  
you re talking about   
it s like a date rape
drug  okay  motherfucker 
where do you get those 
where do i get them  
uh  yeah 
you think just because of
the hue of my skin
that i know where to get
date rape drugs 
you brought up
the date raping 
what are you doing  dale 
you got  n  word
in your eyes 
why are your eyes saying
the  n  word  
klan eyes 
you ve got klan eyes 
you ever take a eye test 
he does 
yes 
all you pick out is the  k

on there 
he does have klan eyes 
you can see them poking out
behind that sheet 
oh  it s just ridic    i can t   
i mean  i m not even gonna   
so  let me ask you a question 
when you got raped by julia 
what did she use
to knock you out  laughing gas 
why are we   
oh  right 
that ll work 
that s pretty interesting 
yeah  do you still have keys
to the  uh  office

well  i mean  his dad
sold him out for  like   
honestly  it was
probably nothing to him 
pennies to him 
the guy s so rich 
that would rock me
to my core 
i mean  have a little empathy 
nick  please 
yeah 
what are
you talking about 
you re acting like
you have stockholm syndrome 
yeah 
what is that 
what is that   
like jet lag 
no 
dude  do i look tired
to you 
you don t  no 
you don t look tired to me 
i m fine 
yeah 
stockholm syndrome is when you
bond with your captors  idiots 
oh  yeah  yeah 
oh  okay 
well 
then hold on a second 
he s the hostage 
yeah 
so technically this would be
reverse stockholm syndrome 
yeah  and we don t
have that  okay 
yes  true 
he s just a really 
really 
really  really 
really likable guy 
i like him a lot 
he s really likable 
cool 
the guy s a winner 
you know 
that s so true 
it s nice to be around
a winner for a change 
oh  boy 
it feels right  nick 
come on  man 
here s what
we re gonna do   
we re gonna go in there 
we re gonna tell him
cops were never part
of this plan 
and the shit ends now 
let s do it 
come on 
it was
a wonderful idea 
didn t work out 
so i think the best thing
to do is just to pull the plug 
and you tell the police
that the guys who got you
chickened out  let you go 
they re long gone 
they didn t all
chicken out 
now s not the time
to back off  boys 
i say we chop off a toe 
mail it to him 
and double the ransom 
now you re talking  yes 
chop  chop  chop 
yes  wait  whose toe 
not it  not it 
not my toe 
no one s toe 
keep your toes 
time to call it off 
nick  nick 
come on 
nick  look at me

every time your back

you got to be careful 
you have to take
what s yours in this   
you have to take it 
take what s yours 
put your name on it 
write your fucking name on it
and say   that s mine  
and take   
and take it 
i think
i ll take it from here  okay 
he s got it  he s got it

help me help you
get revenge on my asshole dad
and get you paid
a million bucks  cash 
yes 
boy  it sounds awesome 
but there s no way
to get it done 
that s not true 
how about this thing 
how about this  how about if
we just put our heads together 
we brainstorm a little 
if we don t come up with
a ransom plan that you love 
we pull the plug 
then you d let us walk 
you have my word 
but if we do come up
with something really inspired 
then we re in it to win it 
well  i i can t stop anybody
from brainstorming 
me and him   
like that 
all right 
i ll see you upstairs 
guys 
  now  there was a time  
  when you loved me so  
  i could have been wrong  
  now you needed to know  
  see  i ve been a bad 
bad  bad  bad man  
  and i m in deep  
  yeah  
  i found a brand new love
for this man  
  and can t wait till you see

  how you like me now   
  how you like me now   
  how you like me now   
  how you like me now   
  how you like me n o o ow   
all right 
let s run it down
from the top 
okay 
first  we tie up rex
in one of those abandoned
warehouses off 3rd 
then we call bert
on a dark phone 
it s prepaid
and untraceable 
go to the bench on the 4th
street bridge to make the drop 
not long enough
to trace the call 
god damn it 
these guys are pros 
i want a tracer
put in that bag 
the police are sending everyone
they ve got to watch the bridge 
weapons tight  eyes on 
all right 
tactical command  red team 
  and i felt the fire  
  there was nothing
for me to do  
here we go 
but when he gets there 
he finds the dark phone
that i planted ahead of time 
then we call him
from the second dark phone 
and we tell him
to proceed downtown 
hello 
you re gonna want to
pull into the garage
under the mandrake hotel
and park in space 4421 
there  you will find
a red bag 
you will transfer the money
into this bag 
then drive out and await
the location of the drop 
and we tell him
if anyone follows him in 
his son s
a fucking corpse 
  i am caught up
in your desire  
  it s flush in the face
desire  
and when burt drives
that far underground 
the police will lose
the signal from his wire 
but when he arrives 
instead of finding a bag 
he finds you three   
disguised  armed  dangerous 
yeah  but the gun s
not loaded  right 
of course not 
nobody gets hurt  come on 
i then tell him to give me
his jacket and tie 
so  just as the cops
are starting to sweat 
dad pulls out
with the new red bag 
just as he was instructed 
sir  we have
the signal back 
thank god 
only it won t be
my father driving 
it ll be our ringer 
we re back on him  sir 
how do you know it s him 
i still have the cash 
and i m heading to the drop 
i guess it s him 
stay with him 
so  i drive
to the staples center 
kings have vancouver 
great matchup 
place will be packed 
the cops will stay
with the money
and wait for the kidnappers
to receive the drop 
hanson made the drop 
stay on the money 
we got our man 
take him down 
  stay down 
  back it up 
a lot of them  too 
back it up  please 
son of a bitch 
by the time the cops
know they ve been had   
   kurt s a ghost 
and nick and dale
disappear with the cash 
and  finally  i am rescued
from my hellish captivity 
oh  thank you 
where s my dad 
dad 
and a week later 
once the smoke clears 
we ll be sitting poolside 
splitting up the cash 
it s raining 
who wants it
