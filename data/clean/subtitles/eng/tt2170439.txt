you put it on there
i did put it on there
permanently on the board now
this illustrates my point
idiots
we need to find somebody

we need to find someone
who can get us our company back
hello nick
guy who saved my life
guy who
fucked my wife
ah it was a blow job
it was a blow job only
didnt fuck her
you got my email
i did
and i was very amused by it
i know bert hanson
i like the cut of his jib
and i do admire
the way he bent you three idiots
over a barrel
and showed you the 50 states
ah see told you
it was a saying
wow
now nick just
just tell me something
why would you start production
without at least a guarantee
of 35 down
to cover manufacturing costs
i mean why would you do that
is he telling a joke
is something funny
uh we assumed that
we were dealing with
somebody who was ethical
no thats the wrong answer
the right answer is because
youre all fucking morons
boy he shined a light
on that didnt he
yeah i think
thats true youre right
youre absolutely right
you thought i was such
a bad boss but i dont know
i think maybe running your
own company into the ground
and ruining the livelihood
of your employees
is maybe a bit worse
what do you think nick
i think thats fair
should i be on the phone
if im taking notes
no we got it we got it here
i mean im not getting
any of what hes saying
its all right
its just a lot of
you know rhetorical questions
okay ill just
try to get his reactions
so what do you want
from me nick
with all due respect you know
what makes a guy like that tick
so if you could give us
some advice
on how to get our money back
i will play real nice
at your next parole hearing
how does that sound
you would do that for me
yes i would
okay
i think i can help you
hes helping
hes gonna help
okay i got a notepad
i got a notepad
from a legal standpoint
legal standpoint
legal standpoint

contact info please

even if you had the money
to fight him in the courts
his lawyers are just gonna
file motions and continuances
long after you three
pissant little fuckups
have blown your tiny
little brains out
are you saying
nothing can be done
no i didnt say that i said
theres nothing you can do
theres plenty that could be
done but you wont do it
and do you want to know why
no not really
because you have no balls
i see
okay
and your fathers had no balls
you are all the product
of generations of ballless men
who were either too weak
or too frightened
to stand up
and take what was theirs
and one day you will pass on
your empty shriveled sacs
to your own pitiful offspring
i cant hear a goddamn thing
what is he talking about
our our nut sacs mostly

sitting down

nine to five
name me two
name me two movies then

i nailed one right on you
nine to five
was this movie
i know what the fuck
nine to five is
its about the white bitch
with the bigass titties
thats the one yeah
she got old
the titties stayed young
guys im not gonna kidnap
someone based on nine to five
thats because
you jane fonda
ooh snap
thats right
youre the scaredycat one
youre always the last
to man up about everything
youre dragging your feet
can i pose a question
to you colonizers
happened
a long time ago
how do you kidnap somebody
without them knowing
theyve been kidnapped
okay
you smarten up
and you dont even do it
hey man no
hes a black sphinx
i like this
yeah
he threw a riddle our way
okay how do you
i can give you the answers
no
ohh
we cant
you should not run a pinkberry
im sorry
i mean thats just
the weirdest negotiating style
we dont have any money
you know were here cause we
have zero dollars were broke
thats true
fuck it
give me the watch
nope
give him your watch
im not giving him this
its a fucking tag heuer
and this is a wrist
without a watch
come on nick give him
its just material things
cant take it with you
right
you can borrow it
while you tell us a shitty plan
all right
slip him a mickey
give me
the watch back
you sneak into his crib
late at night
you find out whatever
his beverage of choice is
before he goes to bed you slip
the mickey in the beverage
knock him out nice and easy
and you keep that bitch sedated
until daddy pays up
wait a second
that could work
thats great
that makes total sense
yeah right cause he
doesnt like see our
faces or hear our voices
were ghosts
no we dont even exist
when youre saying mickey
youre talking about
its like a date rape
drug okay motherfucker

shitting me in there

probably nothing to him
pennies to him
the guys so rich
that would rock me

heres what
were gonna do
were gonna go in there
were gonna tell him
cops were never part
of this plan
and the shit ends now
lets do it
come on
it was
a wonderful idea
didnt work out
so i think the best thing
to do is just to pull the plug
and you tell the police
that the guys who got you
chickened out let you go
theyre long gone
they didnt all
chicken out
nows not the time
to back off boys
i say we chop off a toe
mail it to him
and double the ransom
now youre talking yes
chop chop chop
yes wait whose toe
not it not it
not my toe
no ones toe
keep your toes
time to call it off

hes got it
come on man
help me help you
get revenge on my asshole dad
and get you paid
a million bucks cash
yes
boy it sounds awesome
but theres no way
to get it done
thats not true
how about this thing
how about this how about if
we just put our heads together
we brainstorm a little
if we dont come up with
a ransom plan that you love
we pull the plug
then youd let us walk
you have my word
but if we do come up
with something really inspired
then were in it to win it
well ii cant stop anybody
from brainstorming
me and him
like that
all right
ill see you upstairs
guys
now there was a time
when you loved me so
i could have been wrong

all right
lets run it down
from the top
okay
first we tie up rex
in one of those abandoned
warehouses off 3rd
then we call bert
on a dark phone
its prepaid
and untraceable
go to the bench on the 4th
street bridge to make the drop
not long enough
to trace the call
god damn it
these guys are pros
i want a tracer
put in that bag
the police are sending everyone
theyve got to watch the bridge
weapons tight eyes on
all right
tactical command red team
and i felt the fire
there was nothing
for me to do
here we go
but when he gets there
he finds the dark phone
that i planted ahead of time
then we call him
from the second dark phone
and we tell him
to proceed downtown
hello
youre gonna want to
pull into the garage
under the mandrake hotel
and park in space 4421
there you will find
a red bag
you will transfer the money
into this bag
then drive out and await
the location of the drop
and we tell him
if anyone follows him in
his sons
a fucking corpse
i am caught up
in your desire
its flushintheface
desire
and when burt drives
that far underground
the police will lose
the signal from his wire
but when he arrives
instead of finding a bag
he finds you three
disguised armed dangerous
yeah but the guns
not loaded right
of course not
nobody gets hurt come on
i then tell him to give me
his jacket and tie
so just as the cops
are starting to sweat
dad pulls out
with the new red bag
just as he was instructed
sir we have
the signal back
thank god
only it wont be
my father driving
itll be our ringer
were back on him sir
how do you know its him
i still have the cash
and im heading to the drop
i guess its him
stay with him
so i drive
to the staples center
kings have vancouver
great matchup
place will be packed
the cops will stay
with the money
and wait for the kidnappers
to receive the drop
hanson made the drop
stay on the money
we got our man
take him down
stay down
back it up
a lot of them too
back it up please
son of a bitch
by the time the cops
