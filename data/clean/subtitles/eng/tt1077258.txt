denuded tissue around the incision marks 
indicates that you ve had this bite
for over 14 days

we re not infected 
all survivors gotta come with us 
especially you   
el wray 
i don t go by that name anymore 
it s okay  it s okay 
we re here in quarantine
with the other survivors 
where is here 
the old army base 
el wray 
that you 
he s with them 
i saw him in their convoy earlier 
i m a scientist   
and a businessman 
not military 
which is why he s gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on 
they re stealing biochemical weapons 
dc 2 
also known as  project terror  
designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled landlocked area 
you were supplying it to them 
  that s why they shut you out 
  they found my supply 
it s under our feet 
ten stories down 
what about countering
with atropine and pam 2 
interferes with the neurotoxic delivery 
sets off the cell blaster 
and you re gushing blood and pus
through every sacred hole in your body 
apetizing 
the only treatment
is a regimented exposure to dc 2 itself 
it delays the negative effects 
they need it   
iike a drug 
correct  but we found that
a small percentage of people
are not affected by the gas itself 
and within this small percentage
lies a cure 
what do you want to do 
mexico 
put our backs against the ocean
and defend ourselves from there 
no  we have to get back to my lab 
this infection will sppread
all over the world 
to every man  woman and child 
unless i finish my antidote 
you have an antidote 
you  you 
come with us 
move it

you see  you point it
at what you want to die   
and you pull the little trigger here   
and a little bullet comes out of here 
and the little bullet
hits you right there 
and you know what

and i sure as fuck wasn t supposed to be
the one to punch his dialysis ticket 
so  instead of a chest full of medals 
we get a face full of dc 2 
no cure 
that is  not until we found
somebody from the other side
willing to sell us batches of this shit 
science comes first  but business
comes a close fucking second 
then you realized if you could
infect a large enough populace 
the experiment and its survivors 
you d find a cure 
i swore to my men
that i d do everything in my power
to keepp them alive 
and that s what i intend to do  wray
