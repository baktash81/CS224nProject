what about countering
with atropine and pam2
interferes with the neurotoxic delivery
sets off the cellblaster
and youre gushing blood and pus
through every sacred hole in your body
apetizing
the only treatment
is a regimented exposure to dc2 itself
it delays the negative effects
they need it
iike a drug

a small percentage of people
are not affected by the gas itself
and within this small percentage
lies a cure

a termites nest of caves
on the afghan border
me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands
and our balls in our throats
lookin for americas most wanted
bin laden

somebody from the other side
willing to sell us batches of this shit
science comes first but business
comes a close fucking second

infect a large enough populace
the experiment and its survivors
