like a main circuit cable   
plugged straight into kurtz 
it was no accident that
i got to be the caretaker   
of colonel
walter e  kurtz s memory

oh  jesus  operations officer 
fifth special forces 
luke  would you play that tape
for the captain  please 
  yes  sir  i m sorry  sir 
  listen to this carefully  captain 
october 9  0430 hours 
sector peter  victor  king 
these were monitored
out of cambodia 
this has been verified
as col  kurtz s voice 
i watched a snail   
crawl along the edge
of a straight razor 
that s my dream 
that s my nightmare 
crawling  slithering   
along the edge   
of a straight razor   
and surviving 
transmission 11  received
 68  december 30  0500 hours 
sector king  zulu  king 
but we must kill them 
we must incinerate them 
pig after pig 
cow after cow 
village after village 
army after army 
and they call me an assassin 
what do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin 
they lie  they lie 
and we have to be merciful   
for those who lie 
those nabobs 
i hate them 
i do hate them 
walt kurtz was one of
the most outstanding officers   
this country s ever produced 
he was brilliant 
he was outstanding in every way 
and he was a good man  too 
a humanitarian man 
a man of wit and humor 
he joined the special forces 
and after that his   
ideas  methods   
became   
unsound 
unsound 
now he s crossed
into cambodia with this   
montagnard army of his
that worship   
the man like a god   
and follow every order 
however ridiculous 
well  i have some other
shocking news to tell you 
col  kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder 
i don t follow  sir 
murdered who 
kurtz had ordered the execution of
some vietnamese intelligence agents  
men he believed
were double agents 
so he took matters
into his own hands 
well  you see  willard   
in this war  things
get confused out there 
power  ideals 
the old morality   
and practical
military necessity 
but out there
with these natives   
it must be a temptation to   
be god 
because there s a conflict
in every human heart   
between the rational
and the irrational   
between good and evil   
and good does not
always triumph 
sometimes   
the dark side   
overcomes what lincoln called
the better angels of our nature 
every man has got
a breaking point 
you and i have them 
walt kurtz has reached his 
and very obviously 
he has gone insane 
yes  sir  very much so  sir 
obviously insane 
your mission is to proceed up the
nung river in a navy patrol boat  
pick up col  kurtz s path
at nu mung ba   
follow it  learn what
you can along the way 
when you find the colonel
infiltrate his team by  
whatever means available and
terminate the colonel s command 
terminate the colonel 
he s out there operating
without any decent restraint   
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable   
human conduct   
and he is still on the field 
commanding troops 
terminate with extreme prejudice 
you understand  captain 
that this mission   
does not exist
nor will it ever exist 
how many people
had i already killed 
there were those six
that i knew about for sure  
close enough to blow
their last breath in my face 
but this time
it was an american   
and an officer 
that wasn t supposed to make
any difference to me   
but it did 
shit  charging a man
with murder in this place   
was like handing out
speeding tickets at the indy 500 
i took the mission 
what the hell else was i gonna do 
but i really didn t know
what i d do when i found him 
  did you check the tank 
  yeah 
i was being ferried down
the coast in a navy pbr   
a type of plastic patrol boat  
a pretty common sight on the rivers 
they said it was a good way to
pick up information and move   
without drawing a lot
of attention  and that was okay 
i needed the air and the time 
only problem was
i wouldn t be alone 
mornin   captain 
the crew were
mostly just kids  
rock and rollers with
one foot in their graves 
  how old are you 
  seventeen 
the machinist   the one they
called chef   was from new orleans 
he was wrapped too tight
for vietnam 
probably wrapped too tight
for new orleans 
lance  on the forward fifties   
was a famous surfer
from the beaches south of l a 
to look at him  you wouldn t believe
he d ever fired a weapon in his life 
clean   mr  clean   was
from some south bronx shit hole   
and i think the light
and the space of vietnam   
really put the zap on his head 
then there was phillips 
the chief 
it might have been my mission  but
it sure as shit was the chief s boat 
there s about two points
where we can draw enough water   
to get into the nung river 
they re both hot 
belong to charlie 
don t worry about it 
don t smoke 
you know  i ve pulled
a few special ops in here 
about six months ago   
i took a man who was going up
past the bridge at do lung 
he was regular army  too 
heard he shot himself in the head 
at first i thought
they handed me the wrong dossier 
i couldn t believe
they wanted this man dead 
third generation west point 
top of his class 
korea  airborne 
about a thousand decorations 
et cetera  et cetera 
i d heard his voice on the tape 
and it really put the hook in me   
but i couldn t connect up
that voice with this man 
like they said 
he had an impressive career 
maybe too impressive 
i mean  perfect 
he was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation  
general  chief of staff 
anything 
in 1964  he returned from a tour
with advisory command in vietnam   
and things started to slip 
his report to
the joint chiefs of staff   
and lyndon johnson was restricted 
seems they didn t dig
what he had to tell them 
during the next few months  he
made three requests for transfer   
to airborne training  fort benning 
georgia  and was finally accepted 
airborne 
he was 38 years old 
why the fuck would he do that 
1966  joins special forces   
returns to vietnam 
hey  what s that

hi  tiger  bye  tiger 
good bye 
never get out of the boat 
absolutely  goddamn right   
unless you were going all the way 
kurtz got off the boat 
he split from
the whole fuckin  program 
how did that happen 
what did he see here
that first tour 
thirty eight fucking years old 
if you joined the green berets   
there was no way
you d ever get above colonel 
kurtz knew what
he was giving up 
the more i read
and began to understand   
the more i admired him 
his family and friends
couldn t understand it   
and they couldn t
talk him out of it 
he had to apply three times 
and he put up with a ton of shit 
but when he threatened
to resign  they gave it to him 
the next youngest guy
in his class was half his age 
they must have thought
he was some far out old man   
humping it over that course 
i did it when i was 19 
it damn near wasted me 
a tough motherfucker 
he finished it 
he could have gone for general   
but he went for himself instead 
 dear eva   
 today was really a new one 
almost got eaten alive
by a fuckin  tiger 
really un fucking believable 
you know 
we re taking this guy 
captain willard  up the river   
but he hasn t told us yet
where we re taking him  
come on  baby
 thought you might have
heard by now from elwood  
october 1967 
on special assignment   
kon tum province  ii corps 
kurtz staged operation archangel
with combined local forces 
rated a major success 
he received no official clearance 
he just thought it up and did it 
what balls 
they were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one 
but after the press
got a hold of it   
they promoted him
to full colonel instead 
oh  man  the bullshit
piled up so fast in vietnam 
you needed wings
to stay above it 
this sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit 
expecting us this time 
damned if i know 
hello  hello

or moving too fast 
his idea of great r and r was
cold rice and a little rat meat 
he had only two ways home  
death or victory 
no wonder kurtz put
a weed up command s ass 
the war was being run by
a bunch of four star clowns   
who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away 
hey  you know  man 
that was far fucking out 
i collected every picture of her
since she was miss december  chief 
hey  clean  look at that 
she was here  man 
i even wrote to the cunt 
she didn t write me back 
you can really get hung up
on these broads  man   
just like that cat in the delta 
  yeah  you better believe it 
  what cat 
the one that went up for murder 
he was an army sergeant 
remember  this cat  man  
he really dug his playboy  man 
i mean  like  this cat  when the thing arrived 
he was there to meet it  man 
look at these beautiful
fuckin  jugs  man 
yeah  so anyway 
he was workin  arvn patrols  you know 
had one of them cocky gook asshole
lieutenants and shit 
and one day  the gook took his magazine
from him and wouldn t give it back to him 
he said  
 give me my magazine back  
gook say   you shut up 
i have you court martialed  
  typical fuckin  arvn  man 
  yeah 
  so  like  then the gook starts to go too far  see 
  chef  take the wheel 
this dude started to stick
pinholes in the lady s tits 
take the wheel 
he started sticking pinholes
and mutilating the centerfold and all kinds of shit like that 
and the sergeant said 
 you better not do that to her 
 you leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl 
don t do her like that    right 
  gook say   fuck you  in vietnamese 
  damn 
the sergeant  man  he just couldn t
handle it no more 
he just picked up his iron   
flipped it to rock and roll and   
boom 
gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the playboy mag 
it blew his ass clean
off of the dock 
there wasn t no more lieutenant
that day  man  that was it  for his ass 
  they burn him for it 
  the sergeant  yeah  man 
they stuck his ass in the lbj 
it s too bad he didn t
get no medals or nothin  
fuckin  arvn  man 
they should have killed the fuck 
should have given
the fucker a silver star 
bummer for the gook though 
ain t it 
good morning  vietnam 
i m army specialist
zack johnson on afvn 
it s about 82 degrees in downtown
saigon right now  also very humid 
and we have an important message
for all gi s   
who are living off base
from the mayor of saigon 
yeah 
he d like you to hang your laundry up
indoors instead of on the windowsills 
the mayor wants you
to keep saigon beautiful 
and now  here s another blast from
the past going out to big sam   
who s all alone in the mantle room out there
with the 1st battalion  35th infantry   
and dedicated by the fire team at an khe
to their groovy co   
  the rolling stones   satisfaction  
  all right 
watch out  clean 
get down  bubba

  satisfaction

  i see you is right on target 
   about useless information 
  work out  yeah  yeah  yeah 
  all right 
look out  lance 
  that s what i say  
 commitment and
counter insurgency   
by col  walter e  kurtz 
as long as our officers
and troops perform   
tours of duty limited to one year   
they will remain dilettantes
in war and tourists in vietnam 
as long as cold beer 
hot food  rock and roll   
and all the other amenities
remain the expected norm   
our conduct of the war
will gain only impotence 
we need fewer men  and better 
if they were committed 
this war could be won   
with a fourth
of our present force  
  shit  holy shit 
  chicken time 
you ain t shittin   bro 
they re motherfuckin    
  who is that 
  what s goin  on 
is that you  lazzaro 
don t chicken out 
lazzaro 
come on 
  fire on the canopy 
  i got it  i got it  get outta there 
yeah  i got it 
i got it  i got it 
lance  get down 
put that fucker out  man 
what the fuck
they think they re doin  
late summer  autumn 1968 
kurtz s patrols in the highlands
coming under frequent ambush 
the camp started falling apart 
november 
kurtz orders assassination of
three vietnamese men and one woman 
two of the men were colonels
in the south vietnamese army 
enemy activity in his old sector
dropped off to nothing 
guess he must have hit
the right four people 
he joined the special forces 
after that his   
the army tried one last time
to bring him back into the fold 
     methods   
  and if he d pulled over   
  it all would have been forgotten 
     unsound 
but he kept going 
  now he s crossed into cambodia  
  he kept winning it his way 
  with this montagnard army of his  
  and they called me in 
man like a god and follow
every order  however ridiculous 
they lost him 
he was gone 
nothing but rumors
and random intelligence   
mostly from captured vc 
the vc knew his name by now 
and they were scared of him 
he and his men were
playing hit and run   
all the way into cambodia 
i know where i m goin    
i m goin  to the white house
to have dinner   
   with the president
of the united states  baby 
that s where i m goin  
hey  chef 
put the cover on that 
clean 
how long has that kid
been on this boat 
seven months 
he s really specializing
in busting my balls 
very possible  captain 
he thinks the same of you 
  oh  yeah  what do you think  chief 
  i don t think 
my orders say i m not supposed to
know where i m taking this boat   
so i don t 
but one look at you  and i know
it s gonna be hot  wherever it is 
we re going upriver about
75 clicks above the do luong bridge 
  that s cambodia  captain 
  that s classified 
we re not supposed to be in cambodia 
but that s where i m going 
you just get me close
to my destination   
and i ll cut you
and the crew loose 
all right  captain 
 dear son   
i m afraid that both you and your
mother will have been worried   
at not hearing from me
during the past weeks   
but my situation here
has become a difficult one 
i have been officially
accused of murder by the army 
the alleged victims were
four vietnamese double agents 
we spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence 
when absolute proof was completed 
we acted   we acted like soldiers 
the charges are unjustified 
they are  in fact  and in the
circumstances of this conflict   
quite completely insane 
in a war  there are many moments
for compassion and tender action 
there are many moments
for ruthless action  
what is often
called ruthless   
but may in many circumstances
be only clarity  
seeing clearly what there is
to be done and doing it   
  medevac  come in 
   directly  
  quickly  awake  
  alpha  tango  tango  echo  tango  alpha 
   looking at it

morality  and so i am beyond caring

hey  lance

this is baudelaire 
it s a very cruel poem for children 
but they need it   cause
life sometimes is very cruel 
as you can see   
attack repels by the family 
just for this war 
vietcong  58 
north vietnamese  12 
south vietnamese  11 
americans  six 
yes  well  there were
perhaps mistakes 
may i present captain willard 
he is of a paratroop regiment 
madame sarrault 
captain 
oh  i m sorry  captain 
it was just a little story   
about paris and people
starving during the war 
they are all around the table  and
there was a silence and somebody say   
 an angel is passing by  
so somebody said 
 let s eat it  
oh 
how long can you
possibly stay here 
we stay forever 
no  no  i mean   
why don t you go
back home to france 
  back home 
  i mean  this is our home  captain 
  sooner or later  you re   
  no 
you don t understand
our mentality  
the french officer mentality 
at first  we lose
in second world war 
i don t say that you
americans win  but we lose 
oh  papa  
in dien bien phu  we lose 
in algeria  we lose 
in indochina  we lose 
but here we don t lose 
this piece of earth  we keep it 
we will never lose it 
never 
you americans 
in 1945  yeah   
after the japanese war 
your president roosevelt   
didn t want the french people
to stay in indochina 
so   
you americans invent
the viet minh 
what s he mean 
yeah  that s true  the vietcong
were invented by the americans  sir 
the americans 
and now you take
the french place   
and the viet minh fight you 
and what can you do 
nothing 
absolutely nothing 
the vietnamese are very intelligent 
you never know what they think 
the russian ones who help them 
 come and give us their money 
we are all communists  chinese 
give us guns  we are all brothers  
they hate the chinese 
maybe they hate the american
less than the russian and the chinese 
i mean  if tomorrow
the vietnamese are communists   
they will be vietnamese communists 
and this is something that you
never understood  you american 
i don t know 
maybe in the future we can make
something with the viet minh 
don t you understand 
the vc say 
 go away  go away  
that s finish for all
the white people in indochina 
if you re french  american 
that s all the same 
 go   they want to forget you 
look at them 
look  this is the truth 
an egg 
the white left   
but the yellow stays 
when i was in saigon 
i spoke to an american politician 
he explained it very well 
he said   look 
yesterday  it was korea 
today  vietnam 
tomorrow  thailand 
the philippines   
then maybe europe  
come on  why not europe 
look what happened
in czechoslovakia recently 
even before second world war americans
knew exactly what was going on 
they don t want
that shit to take over  lefevre 
all you white people are shit 
they are fighting  
fighting for freedom 
freedom  bullshit 
french bullshit 
american bullshit 
dien bien phu 
that serious 
all soldiers know
they are already dead 
you know anything
about dien bien phu 
  yeah  i know 
  no  you don t 
  not really 
  dien bien phu was an error 
a military mistake 
a mistake 
a voluntary mistake 
voluntary 
all the soldiers knew 
we knew we would be dead 
the generals and the colonels believe
it s impossible for the viets   
to get the cannon
up there in the mountains 
but they do  then they wait
for the rain to come 
when it comes 
no airplane can fly there 
and our paratroopers
jump at 90 meters 
i mean  you know 
90 meters   70 meters 
i mean  that s crazy 
no army in the world can do that 
and they only do that
to be dead with their friends 
no  no 
the french army was sacrificed 
sacrificed by the politicians
safe at home 
they put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldn t win 
the students are
marching in paris   
protesting  demonstrating 
they stab the soldiers
in their back 
the soldier would open
the grenade  it wouldn t work 
a piece of paper would fall  
 union of french women  
 we are for the viets  
traitors 
communist traitors at home 
dien bien phu  okay 
the french is shit  huh 
no one care 
no one want  
why don t you americans
learn from us  from our mistakes 
mon dieux  with your army 
your strength   
your power  you could win
if you want to 
you can win 
you know  i m sure
we can make something here 
i m sure about it 
you know 
i never do something wrong
to the people here 
that s right  but the communist
at home have never been traitors 
  communist 
  socialist 
excuse me  i have to go 
capitain  good night 
i was a socialist  you know 
we can stay  i know
that we can stay  we can 
you know  we always
helped the people 
we work with the people 
so we can be friends 
we are agreed 
see  captain 
when my grandfather   
and my uncle s father
came here   
there was nothing  
nothing 
the vietnamese were nothing 
so we worked hard   
very hard  and brought   
the rubber from brazil 
and then plant it here 
we took the vietnamese 
work with them   
make something  
something out of nothing 
so when you ask me why
we want to stay here  captain   
we want to stay here because
it s ours   it belongs to us 
it keeps our family together 
i mean  we fight for that 
while you americans 
you are fighting for   
the biggest nothing in history 
i m sorry  captain  i will see
if your men need any help to   
repair your boat   
so that you can go on
with your war 
i apologize
for my family  captain 
we have all lost much here 
hubert   his wife
and two sons 
and i have lost a husband 
i understand 
you are tired of the war 
i can see it in your face 
 twas the same in the eyes
of the soldiers of our war

 les soldats perdus   
 the lost soldiers  
if you like 
we can have some cognac

to see about my men and  
the war will be
still here tomorrow

no wine at dinner

will you go back
after the war  to america 
no 
then you re like us  
your home is here 
do you know why you can never step
into the same river twice 
yeah   cause it s always moving 
i used to prepare
a pipe for my husband 
 twas the morphine he took for
the wounds he suffered in his heart 
he would rage and he would cry 
my lost soldier 
and i said to him 
 there are two of you 
don t you see 
one that kills

part of me was afraid
of what i would find   
and what i would do
when i got there 
i knew the risks   
or imagined i knew 
but the thing
i felt the most   
much stronger than fear   
was the desire to confront him

i mean  sometimes he ll  
well  you say hello to him 
right 
and he ll just walk right by you
and he won t even notice you 
then suddenly he ll grab you and he ll
throw you in a corner and he ll say   
 do you know that  if

if you can keep your head when all about
you are losing theirs and blaming you 
if you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you

september 22  1967 
volume 90   
number 12 
 the war on the horizon  the american
people may find it hard to believe   
that the us is winning
the war in vietnam 
nevertheless   
one of the most
exhaustive inquiries   
into the status
of the conflict yet compiled   
offers considerable evidence
that the weight of us power   
two and a half years
after the big buildup began   
is beginning to
make itself felt 
white house officials maintain
the impact of that strength   
may bring the enemy
to the point where he could   
simply be unable
to continue fighting  
is this familiar 
 because lyndon johnson
fears that the us public   
is in no mood to accept
its optimistic conclusions   
he may never permit the report
to be released in full 
even so  he is sufficiently
impressed with the findings   
and sufficiently anxious to
make their conclusions known   
to permit experts
who have been working on it   
to talk about it
in general terms  
no date  time magazine 
 sir robert thompson   
who led the victory
over communist guerillas in malaya   
is now a rand corporation
consultant   
recently returned to vietnam to sound
out the situation for president nixon 
he told the president
last week   
that things felt
much better   
and smelled much better
over there  
how do they smell
to you  soldier 
you ll be free 
you ll be under guard 
read these at your leisure 
don t lose them 
don t try to escape 
you ll be shot 
we can talk
of these things later 
 we are the hollow men 
we are the stuffed men   
leaning together  headpiece
filled with straw 
alas  our dried voices
when we whisper together   
are quiet and meaningless
as wind in dry grass   
or a rat s feet over
broken glass in a dry cellar 
he s really out there 
shape without form   
shade without color   
paralyzed force   
gesture without motion  
do you know what
the man s saying  do you 
 those who have crossed    
this is dialectics 
it s very simple dialectics 
it s one through nine 
no maybes  no supposes  no fractions 
you can t travel in space  you can t
go out into space  you know   
without like  you know 
with fractions 
what are you gonna land on 
one quarter  three eighths 
what are you gonna do when
you go from here to venus 
that s dialectic physics  okay 
dialectic logic is 
there s only love and hate 
you either love somebody
or you hate  em 
mutt 
you mutt 
this is the way
the fucking world is 
look at this fucking shit
we re in  man 
not with a bang 
a whimper 
and with a whimper 
i m fucking splitting  jack 
on the river  i thought that
the minute i looked at him   
i d know what to do 
but it didn t happen 
i was in there with him
for days  not under guard 
i was free 
but he knew
i wasn t going anywhere 
he knew more about what
i was going to do than i did 
if the generals back in nha trang
could see what i saw   
would they still want me
to kill him 
more than ever  probably 
and what would his people back home
want if they ever learned   
just how far from them
he d really gone 
he broke from them   
and then he broke
from himself 
i d never seen a man
so broken up and   
ripped apart 
i ve seen the horrors  
horrors that you ve seen 
but you have no right
to call me a murderer 
you have a right to kill me 
you have a right to do that 
but you have no right
to judge me 
it s impossible for words   
to describe   
what is necessary   
to those   
who do not know   
what horror means 
horror 
horror has a face 
and you must make
a friend of horror 
horror and moral terror   
are your friends 
if they are not   
then they are enemies
to be feared 
they are truly enemies 
i remember when i was
with special forces 
seems a thousand centuries ago 
we went into a camp
to inoculate   
some children 
we d left the camp   
after we had inoculated
the children for polio 
and this old man came running
after us  and he was crying 
he couldn t say 
we went back there   
and they had come
and hacked off   
every inoculated arm 
there they were 
in a pile  
a pile of   
little arms 
and i remember   
i i   i cried 
i wept like   
some grandmother 
i wanted to tear my teeth out 
i didn t know what i wanted to do 
and i want to remember it 
i never want to forget it 
i never want to forget 
and then i realized   
like i was shot  
like i was shot
with a diamond  
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead 
and i thought 
 my god  the genius of that 
the genius  
the will to do that 
perfect  genuine  complete 
crystalline  pure 
and then i realized   
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it 
these were not monsters 
these were men   
trained cadres 
these men who fought
with their hearts   
who have families 
who have children   
who are filled with love   
that they had the strength 
the strength   
to do that 
if i had ten divisions
of those men   
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly 
you have to have men   
who are moral   
and at the same time   
who are able to   
utilize their   
primordial instincts to kill   
without feeling 
without passion   
without judgment   without judgment 
because it s judgment that defeats us 
i worry that my son   
might not understand
what i ve tried to be 
and if i were
to be killed  willard   
i would want someone
to go to my home   
and tell my son everything 
everything i did 
everything you saw 
because there s nothing
that i detest more than   
the stench of lies 
and if you understand me 
willard  you  
you will do this for me 
pbr street gang 
this is almighty  over 
pbr street gang  this is
almighty standing by  over 
pbr street gang  this is almighty
standing by  how do you copy 
they were gonna make me
a major for this   
and i wasn t even in
their fuckin  army anymore 
everybody wanted me to do it 
him most of all 
i felt like he was up there   
waiting for me
to take the pain away 
he just wanted to go out
like a soldier   
standing up 
not like some poor 
wasted  rag assed renegade 
even the jungle wanted him dead 
and that s who he really
took his orders from anyway 
  come on  baby  
  take a chance with us  
  come on  baby  
  take a chance with us  
  come on  baby  
  take a chance with us  
  and meet me at the back  
  of the blue bus tonight  
  blue bus tonight  
  blue bus tonight

  come on  yeah  
we train young men
to drop fire on people   
but their commanders   
won t allow them
to write  fuck    
on their airplanes because   
it s obscene 
the horror

calling pbr street gang 
pbr street gang  this is almighty
