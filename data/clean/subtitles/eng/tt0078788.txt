it was no accident that
i got to be the caretaker
of colonel
walter e kurtzs memory
any more than being back
in saigon was an accident

a government tax collector
quang tri province
june 18 1968
captain

nor would i be disposed to
discuss such an operation
if it did in fact exist sir
i thought wed have
a bite of lunch while we talk
i hope you brought
a good appetite captain
i notice that you have
a bad hand there you wounded
i had a little fishing accident

well lets see what we have here
roast beef and usually its not bad
try some jerry
and pass it around
to save a little time
we might pass both ways
captain i dont know how
you feel about this shrimp
but if youll eat it
youll never have to prove
your courage in any other way
i swear why dont i
just take a piece here
captain youve heard of
colonel walter e kurtz
yes sir
ive heard the name
oh jesus operations officer
fifth special forces
luke would you play that tape
for the captain please
yes sir im sorry sir
listen to this carefully captain
october 9 0430 hours
sector peter victor king
these were monitored
out of cambodia
this has been verified
as col kurtzs voice
i watched a snail
crawl along the edge
of a straight razor
thats my dream
thats my nightmare
crawling slithering
along the edge
of a straight razor
and surviving
transmission 11 received
68 december 30 0500 hours
sector king zulu king
but we must kill them
we must incinerate them
pig after pig
cow after cow
village after village
army after army
and they call me an assassin
what do you call it when
the assassins accuse the assassin
they lie they lie
and we have to be merciful
for those who lie
those nabobs
i hate them
i do hate them
walt kurtz was one of
the most outstanding officers
this countrys ever produced
he was brilliant
he was outstanding in every way
and he was a good man too
a humanitarian man
a man of wit and humor
he joined the special forces
and after that his
ideas methods
became
unsound
unsound
now hes crossed
into cambodia with this
montagnard army of his
that worship
the man like a god
and follow every order
however ridiculous
well i have some other
shocking news to tell you
col kurtz was about
to be arrested for murder
i dont follow sir
murdered who
kurtz had ordered the execution of
some vietnamese intelligence agents
men he believed
were double agents
so he took matters
into his own hands
well you see willard
in this war things
get confused out there
power ideals
the old morality
and practical
military necessity
but out there
with these natives
it must be a temptation to
be god
because theres a conflict
in every human heart
between the rational
and the irrational
between good and evil
and good does not
always triumph
sometimes
the dark side
overcomes what lincoln called
the better angels of our nature
every man has got
a breaking point
you and i have them
walt kurtz has reached his
and very obviously
he has gone insane
yes sir very much so sir
obviously insane
your mission is to proceed up the
nung river in a navy patrol boat
pick up col kurtzs path
at nu mung ba
follow it learn what
you can along the way
when you find the colonel
infiltrate his team by
whatever means available and
terminate the colonels command
terminate the colonel
hes out there operating
without any decent restraint
totally beyond the pale
of any acceptable
human conduct
and he is still on the field
commanding troops
terminate with extreme prejudice
you understand captain
that this mission
does not exist
nor will it ever exist
how many people
had i already killed
there were those six
that i knew about for sure
close enough to blow
their last breath in my face
but this time
it was an american
and an officer
that wasnt supposed to make
any difference to me
but it did
shit charging a man
with murder in this place
was like handing out
speeding tickets at the indy 500
i took the mission
what the hell else was i gonna do
but i really didnt know
what id do when i found him
did you check the tank
yeah
i was being ferried down
the coast in a navy pbr
a type of plastic patrol boat
a pretty common sight on the rivers
they said it was a good way to
pick up information and move
without drawing a lot
of attention and that was okay
i needed the air and the time
only problem was
i wouldnt be alone
mornin captain
the crew were
mostly just kids
rock and rollers with
one foot in their graves
how old are you
seventeen
the machinist the one they
called chef was from new orleans
he was wrapped too tight
for vietnam
probably wrapped too tight
for new orleans
lance on the forward fifties
was a famous surfer
from the beaches south of la
to look at him you wouldnt believe
hed ever fired a weapon in his life
clean mr clean was
from some south bronx shithole
and i think the light
and the space of vietnam
really put the zap on his head
then there was phillips
the chief
it might have been my mission but
it sure as shit was the chiefs boat
theres about two points
where we can draw enough water
to get into the nung river
theyre both hot
belong to charlie
dont worry about it
dont smoke
you know ive pulled
a few special ops in here
about six months ago
i took a man who was going up
past the bridge at do lung
he was regular army too
heard he shot himself in the head
at first i thought
they handed me the wrong dossier
i couldnt believe
they wanted this man dead
thirdgeneration west point
top of his class
korea airborne
about a thousand decorations
et cetera et cetera
id heard his voice on the tape
and it really put the hook in me
but i couldnt connect up
that voice with this man
like they said
he had an impressive career
maybe too impressive
i mean perfect
he was being groomed for one of
the top slots in the corporation
general chief of staff
anything
in 1964 he returned from a tour
with advisory command in vietnam
and things started to slip
his report to
the joint chiefs of staff
and lyndon johnson was restricted
seems they didnt dig
what he had to tell them
during the next few months he
made three requests for transfer
to airborne training fort benning
georgia and was finally accepted
airborne
he was 38 years old
why the fuck would he do that
1966 joins special forces
returns to vietnam

what did he see here
that first tour
thirtyeight fucking years old
if you joined the green berets
there was no way
youd ever get above colonel
kurtz knew what
he was giving up
the more i read
and began to understand
the more i admired him
his family and friends
couldnt understand it
and they couldnt
talk him out of it
he had to apply three times
and he put up with a ton of shit
but when he threatened
to resign they gave it to him
the next youngest guy
in his class was half his age
they must have thought
he was some farout old man
humping it over that course
i did it when i was 19
it damn near wasted me
a tough motherfucker
he finished it
he could have gone for general
but he went for himself instead
dear eva
today was really a new one
almost got eaten alive
by a fuckin tiger
really unfucking believable
you know
were taking this guy
captain willard up the river
but he hasnt told us yet
where were taking him
come on baby
thought you might have
heard by now from elwood
october 1967
on special assignment
kon tum province ii corps
kurtz staged operation archangel
with combined local forces
rated a major success
he received no official clearance
he just thought it up and did it
what balls
they were gonna nail his ass
to the floorboards for that one
but after the press
got a hold of it
they promoted him
to full colonel instead
oh man the bullshit
piled up so fast in vietnam
you needed wings
to stay above it
this sure enough is a bizarre sight
in the middle of this shit
expecting us this time
damned if i know

his idea of great r and r was
cold rice and a little rat meat
he had only two ways home
death or victory
no wonder kurtz put
a weed up commands ass
the war was being run by
a bunch of fourstar clowns
who were gonna end up
giving the whole circus away
hey you know man
that was farfuckingout
i collected every picture of her
since she was miss december chief
hey clean look at that
she was here man

he was an army sergeant
remember this cat man

i mean like this cat when the thing arrived
he was there to meet it man
look at these beautiful
fuckin jugs man
yeah so anyway
he was workin arvn patrols you know
had one of them cocky gook asshole
lieutenants and shit
and one day the gook took his magazine
from him and wouldnt give it back to him
he said
give me my magazine back
gook say you shut up
i have you courtmartialed
typical fuckin arvn man
yeah
so like then the gook starts to go too far see
chef take the wheel
this dude started to stick
pinholes in the ladys tits
take the wheel
he started sticking pinholes
and mutilating the centerfold and all kinds of shit like that
and the sergeant said
you better not do that to her
you leave your shitty little
gook hands off of that girl
dont do her like that right
gook say fuck you in vietnamese
damn
the sergeant man he just couldnt
handle it no more
he just picked up his iron
flipped it to rock and roll and
boom
gave that little zero a long burst
straight through the playboy mag
it blew his ass clean
off of the dock
there wasnt no more lieutenant
that day man that was it  for his ass
they burn him for it
the sergeant yeah man
they stuck his ass in the lbj
its too bad he didnt
get no medals or nothin
fuckin arvn man
they should have killed the fuck
should have given
the fucker a silver star
bummer for the gook though
aint it
good morning vietnam
im army specialist
zack johnson on afvn
its about 82 degrees in downtown
saigon right now also very humid
and we have an important message
for all gis
who are living off base
from the mayor of saigon
yeah
hed like you to hang your laundry up
indoors instead of on the windowsills
the mayor wants you
to keep saigon beautiful
and now heres another blast from
the past going out to big sam
whos all alone in the mantle room out there

and dedicated by the fire team at an khe
to their groovy co

and the man comes on the radio
tell em you did it lance
hes tellin me
more and more
i see you is right on target
about useless information
work out yeah yeah yeah
all right
look out lance
thats what i say
commitment and
counterinsurgency
by col walter e kurtz
as long as our officers
and troops perform
tours of duty limited to one year
they will remain dilettantes
in war and tourists in vietnam
as long as cold beer
hot food rock and roll
and all the other amenities
remain the expected norm
our conduct of the war
will gain only impotence
we need fewer men and better
if they were committed
this war could be won
with a fourth
of our present force
shit holy shit
chicken time
you aint shittin bro
theyre motherfuckin
who is that
whats goin on
is that you lazzaro
dont chicken out
lazzaro
come on
fire on the canopy
i got it i got it get outta there
yeah i got it
i got it i got it
lance get down
put that fucker out man
what the fuck
they think theyre doin
late summer autumn 1968
kurtzs patrols in the highlands
coming under frequent ambush
the camp started falling apart
november
kurtz orders assassination of
three vietnamese men and one woman
two of the men were colonels
in the south vietnamese army
enemy activity in his old sector
dropped off to nothing
guess he must have hit
the right four people
he joined the special forces
after that his
the army tried one last time
to bring him back into the fold
methods
and if hed pulled over
it all would have been forgotten
unsound
but he kept going
now hes crossed into cambodia
he kept winning it his way
with this montagnard army of his
and they called me in
man like a god and follow
every order however ridiculous
they lost him
he was gone
nothing but rumors
and random intelligence
mostly from captured vc
the vc knew his name by now
and they were scared of him
he and his men were
playing hitandrun
all the way into cambodia
i know where im goin
im goin to the white house
to have dinner
with the president
of the united states baby
thats where im goin
hey chef
put the cover on that
clean
how long has that kid
been on this boat
seven months
hes really specializing
in busting my balls
very possible captain
he thinks the same of you
oh yeah what do you think chief
i dont think
my orders say im not supposed to
know where im taking this boat
so i dont
but one look at you and i know
its gonna be hot wherever it is
were going upriver about
75 clicks above the do luong bridge
thats cambodia captain
thats classified

but thats where im going
you just get me close
to my destination
and ill cut you

all right captain
dear son
im afraid that both you and your
mother will have been worried
at not hearing from me
during the past weeks
but my situation here
has become a difficult one
i have been officially
accused of murder by the army
the alleged victims were
four vietnamese double agents
we spent months uncovering them
and accumulating evidence
when absolute proof was completed
we acted we acted like soldiers
the charges are unjustified
they are in fact and in the
circumstances of this conflict
quite completely insane
in a war there are many moments
for compassion and tender action
there are many moments
for ruthless action
what is often
called ruthless
but may in many circumstances
be only clarity
seeing clearly what there is
to be done and doing it
medevac come in
directly
quickly awake
alpha tango tango echo tango alpha
looking at it
request dustoff
three maybe four kias over
i trust you to tell your mother
what you choose about this letter
as for the charges against me
i am unconcerned
medevac come in
i am beyond their timid lying
morality and so i am beyond caring

americans win but we lose
oh papa
in dien bien phu we lose
in algeria we lose
in indochina we lose

this piece of earth we keep it
we will never lose it

you americans
in 1945 yeah
after the japanese war
your president roosevelt
didnt want the french people
to stay in indochina
so
you americans invent
the viet minh
whats he mean
yeah thats true the vietcong
were invented by the americans sir
the americans
and now you take
the french place
and the viet minh fight you
and what can you do
nothing
absolutely nothing
the vietnamese are very intelligent
you never know what they think
the russian ones who help them
come and give us their money
we are all communists chinese
give us guns we are all brothers
they hate the chinese
maybe they hate the american
less than the russian and the chinese
i mean if tomorrow
the vietnamese are communists
they will be vietnamese communists
and this is something that you
never understood you american
i dont know
maybe in the future we can make
something with the viet minh
dont you understand
the vc say
go away go away
thats finish for all
the white people in indochina
if youre french american
thats all the same
go they want to forget you
look at them
look this is the truth
an egg
the white left
but the yellow stays
when i was in saigon
i spoke to an american politician
he explained it very well
he said look
yesterday it was korea
today vietnam
tomorrow thailand
the philippines
then maybe europe
come on why not europe
look what happened
in czechoslovakia recently
even before second world war americans
knew exactly what was going on
they dont want
that shit to take over lefevre
all you white people are shit
they are fighting
fighting for freedom
freedom bullshit
french bullshit
american bullshit
dien bien phu
that serious
all soldiers know
they are already dead
you know anything
about dien bien phu
yeah i know
no you dont
not really
dien bien phu was an error
a military mistake
a mistake
a voluntary mistake
voluntary
all the soldiers knew
we knew we would be dead
the generals and the colonels believe
its impossible for the viets
to get the cannon
up there in the mountains
but they do then they wait
for the rain to come
when it comes
no airplane can fly there
and our paratroopers
jump at 90 meters
i mean you know
90 meters 70 meters
i mean thats crazy
no army in the world can do that
and they only do that
to be dead with their friends
no no
the french army was sacrificed
sacrificed by the politicians
safe at home
they put the army in an impossible
situation where they couldnt win
the students are
marching in paris
protesting demonstrating
they stab the soldiers
in their back
the soldier would open
the grenade it wouldnt work
a piece of paper would fall
union of french women
we are for the viets
traitors
communist traitors at home
dien bien phu okay
the french is shit huh
no one care
no one want
why dont you americans
learn from us from our mistakes
mon dieux with your army
your strength
your power you could win
if you want to
you can win
you know im sure
we can make something here
im sure about it
you know
i never do something wrong
to the people here
thats right but the communist
at home have never been traitors
communist
socialist
excuse me i have to go
capitain good night
i was a socialist you know
we can stay i know
that we can stay we can
you know we always
helped the people
we work with the people
so we can be friends
we are agreed
see captain
when my grandfather
and my uncles father
came here
there was nothing
nothing
the vietnamese were nothing
so we worked hard
very hard and brought
the rubber from brazil
and then plant it here
we took the vietnamese
work with them
make something
something out of nothing
so when you ask me why
we want to stay here captain
we want to stay here because
its ours it belongs to us
it keeps our family together

while you americans
you are fighting for
the biggest nothing in history

number 12
the war on the horizon the american
people may find it hard to believe
that the us is winning
the war in vietnam
nevertheless
one of the most
exhaustive inquiries
into the status
of the conflict yet compiled
offers considerable evidence
that the weight of us power
twoandahalf years
after the big buildup began
is beginning to
make itself felt
white house officials maintain
the impact of that strength
may bring the enemy
to the point where he could
simply be unable
to continue fighting
is this familiar
because lyndon johnson
fears that the us public
is in no mood to accept
its optimistic conclusions
he may never permit the report
to be released in full
even so he is sufficiently
impressed with the findings
and sufficiently anxious to
make their conclusions known
to permit experts
who have been working on it
to talk about it
in general terms
no date time magazine
sir robert thompson
who led the victory
over communist guerillas in malaya
is now a rand corporation
consultant
recently returned to vietnam to sound
out the situation for president nixon
he told the president
last week
that things felt
much better
and smelled much better
over there
how do they smell
to you soldier
youll be free
youll be under guard
read these at your leisure
dont lose them
dont try to escape
youll be shot
we can talk
of these things later
we are the hollow men
we are the stuffed men
leaning together headpiece
filled with straw
alas our dried voices
when we whisper together
are quiet and meaningless
as wind in dry grass
or a rats feet over
broken glass in a dry cellar
hes really out there
shape without form
shade without color
paralyzed force
gesture without motion
do you know what
the mans saying do you
those who have crossed
this is dialectics
its very simple dialectics
its one through nine
no maybes no supposes no fractions
you cant travel in space you cant
go out into space you know
without like you know
with fractions
what are you gonna land on
onequarter threeeighths
what are you gonna do when
you go from here to venus
thats dialectic physics okay
dialectic logic is
theres only love and hate
you either love somebody
or you hate em
mutt
you mutt
this is the way
the fucking world is
look at this fucking shit
were in man
not with a bang
a whimper
and with a whimper
im fucking splitting jack
on the river i thought that
the minute i looked at him
id know what to do
but it didnt happen
i was in there with him
for days not under guard
i was free
but he knew
i wasnt going anywhere
he knew more about what
i was going to do than i did
if the generals back in nha trang
could see what i saw
would they still want me
to kill him
more than ever probably
and what would his people back home
want if they ever learned
just how far from them
hed really gone
he broke from them
and then he broke
from himself
id never seen a man
so broken up and
ripped apart
ive seen the horrors
horrors that youve seen
but you have no right
to call me a murderer
you have a right to kill me
you have a right to do that
but you have no right
to judge me
its impossible for words
to describe
what is necessary
to those
who do not know
what horror means
horror
horror has a face
and you must make
a friend of horror
horror and moral terror
are your friends
if they are not
then they are enemies
to be feared
they are truly enemies
i remember when i was
with special forces
seems a thousand centuries ago
we went into a camp
to inoculate
some children
wed left the camp
after we had inoculated
the children for polio
and this old man came running
after us and he was crying
he couldnt say
we went back there
and they had come
and hacked off
every inoculated arm
there they were
in a pile
a pile of
little arms
and i remember
ii i cried
i wept like
some grandmother
i wanted to tear my teeth out
i didnt know what i wanted to do
and i want to remember it
i never want to forget it
i never want to forget
and then i realized
like i was shot
like i was shot
with a diamond
a diamond bullet
right through my forehead
and i thought
my god the genius of that
the genius
the will to do that
perfect genuine complete
crystalline pure
and then i realized
they were stronger than me
because they could stand it
these were not monsters
these were men
trained cadres
these men who fought
with their hearts
who have families
who have children
who are filled with love
that they had the strength
the strength
to do that
if i had ten divisions
of those men
then our troubles here
would be over very quickly
you have to have men
who are moral
and at the same time
who are able to
utilize their
primordial instincts to kill
without feeling
without passion
without judgment without judgment
because its judgment that defeats us
i worry that my son
might not understand
what ive tried to be
and if i were
to be killed willard
i would want someone
to go to my home
and tell my son everything
everything i did
everything you saw
because theres nothing
that i detest more than
the stench of lies
and if you understand me
willard you
you will do this for me
pbr street gang
this is almighty over
pbr street gang this is
almighty standing by over
pbr street gang this is almighty
standing by how do you copy
they were gonna make me
a major for this
and i wasnt even in
their fuckin army anymore
everybody wanted me to do it
him most of all
i felt like he was up there
waiting for me
to take the pain away
he just wanted to go out
like a soldier
standing up
not like some poor
wasted ragassed renegade
even the jungle wanted him dead
and thats who he really
took his orders from anyway
come on baby
take a chance with us
come on baby
take a chance with us
come on baby
take a chance with us
and meet me at the back
of the blue bus tonight
blue bus tonight
blue bus tonight
blue
come on yeah
we train young men
to drop fire on people
but their commanders
wont allow them
to write fuck
on their airplanes because
its obscene
the horror
the horror
calling pbr street gang
pbr street gang this is almighty
do you read me over
