particular arena of combat 
maybe this 
i ll take you
back to the base

the obstacle course

familiar to
armed service recruits 
except here in intelligence

of scorched earth 
this is your standard
bog negotiation trial 
you ll be judged
on survivability and time

moment of my life 
well  you just wait 
you re my hero  i ve
read all your papers 
how d you get
my papers 
oh  you mean
my medical papers 
are you
making fun of me 
oh  karen 
our first fight 
you might think i m silly
to worship you the way i do 
but in my estimation 
you re a genius 
well  i think genius
is a pretty strong word 
but if you insist on using it 
i can handle it 
in fact  i hesitate
to mention my problem 
it s a task hardly worthy
of your abilities 
go ahead  mention it 
there s nothing
i wouldn t do for you 
the khan s brother 
he s been suffering
from pain in
the right lower abdomen 
obviously
an inflamed appendix 
obviously 
dr  hadley was
going to remove it 
but now that
you re here 
just to see you perform
even a simple surgery
would be a great thrill
in my life 
i d really rather not 
i don t have
my instruments with me 
use dr  hadley s 
the khan s brother
is being prepped now 
if you refuse
to do this 
the khan will lose
faith in you and us 
the consequences
could be severe 
i see 
well  the truth is
i am a great surgeon 
but alas  i recently suffered
severe nerve damage
in my left hand 
oh  my god 
yeah  look at that 
no feeling at all 
dead 
how did that happen 
i was lifting
a car off a child 
it was a big cadillac 
i m so disappointed 
the khan will be
very suspicious 
my god 
oh  there  there  there 
actually  i could
operate without my hands 
dr  greenbaum
could be my hands 
i could tell him
what to do 
youwouldget a chance
see me in action 
that would be
wonderful 
after i guide dr  greenbaum
through an operation 
i get very depressed 
i couldn t
do it myself 
it s a very bad time
for me 
don t you worry 
i ll be with you 
give me a break 
about an hour 
fine  an hour 
thank you 
bye 
bye 
you re good with tools 
aren t you  instruments 
you kidding  you re
talking to millbarge 
want something converted 
built  repaired  modified 
you re talking
to mr  hands 
ahh  mind if
i play through 
doctor  doctor 
glad i m not sick 
if anything happens to him 
my people will be angry 
to die in battle
is glorious 
to die in a tent
is disgrace 
and with that  i give you
dr  julius greenbaum 
thank you  doctor 
i ll just step out
for a smoke 
perhaps
i ll stay here 
today we ll be removing
the patient s appendix 
the first step in an operation
of this particular type is   
to shave the patient 
nah  forget it 
forget it 
we ll skip the shave
and go to the operation 
the second step
in this operation is   
anesthetic 
but can t you tell
he s already been given
the required injection
of pentothal 
of course 
he s already been given
the required    injections 
all right  let us begin
the operation 
thank you  doctor 
and now 
the first incision 
doctor 
isn t that incision
a bit high
for an appendix 
do you want to do
the operation 
fine  you come on up here 
and you do it 
imhaus 
he was cutting
into his chest 
did i cut his chest 
i was probing to determining
muscle tone and skeletal girth 
it s a new technique 
we mock what
we don t understand 
go ahead  will you 
i m getting hungry 
and now 
the first incision 
and now 
i will incise 
cut the sucker 
ahhhhh   
this man is dead 
excuse us 
thank you 
let me do it 
emmett

aaah 
aaah 
this way 
gentlemen 
welcome to w  a  m  p 
general sline  sir 
yes  sergeant 
it s a collect call from
pakistan for mr  ruby
from mr  fitz hume 
what 
we ll just be
another minute 
thank you
for your patience 
it s collect  their
contacts tried to kill them 
they don t know what to do 
and they told you this
over a public phone 
no  sir  at t s operator
told our operator 
they re insane 
and apparently
roaming free 
he s on line 7  sir 
get us the hell out 
everything s under
control  mr  fitz hume 
hold on one moment 
look  the longer they re
out in the field 
the more heat we can draw
away from the real team 
i agree  let s send them
over the border 
how will
they get there 
that s their problem 
hello  gentlemen 
we re organizing
a rescue operation for you 
for after you ve reached
your final objective 
what is
our final objective 
that information is on
a need to know basis 
at this particular time 
you do not need to know 
however  we can tell you
to make immediately
for the soviet pamir district 
wait for your next contact
on the road to dushanbe 
the road to dushanbe 
you practically told them
the strike zone 
listen  if they
make it there at all 
they ll be plucked by
soviet motorized infantry 
the road to dushanbe
is a heavily traveled
military artery 
i guess that
takes care of that 
we must make
no mistakes this time 
our whole way of life
hangs in the balance 
pamir  dushanbe 
you re sure
that s what he said 
right  aren t they
in russia 
and how 
no  thanks 
i ve already eaten 
how can we get there 
it s thousands of miles 
if this is
the lower kohistan 
we re about 150 miles
from the soviet border 
youwouldhave to
know that 
wait a minute 
how do we cross
the soviet border 
we don t shave 
sell the ambulance 
sell our clothes 
and go native 
how far do we have
to go on this bus 
as far as it
takes us 
hey  look 
it s dr  boyer 
she s the last person
we want to see 
no  she s nice 
what s this  the border 
no  toll stop 
hopefully  there won t be
guardposts where we cross 
look 
dr  boyer 
leave it alone 
i left without
saying good bye 
where are you going 
you can t deny what
happened between us 
don t touch me 
come on 
 don t touch me  
look at this 
it s really neat 
how can she let a little death
interfere with romance 
they couldn t
have done better 
they aren t doctors 
what do you mean 
that metal case she was
packing on her horse 
what about it 
it s a satscrambler
terminal 
sophisticated equipment
for sending  scrambling 
and receiving
satellite messages 
so she s
a sophisticated woman 
it s a highly
classified piece
of intelligence
hardware 
she s a high class
intelligent piece 
knock it off 
you re saying that
they re spies like us 
they re spies  but not
necessarily on our side 
i think it s our duty
as american operatives
to follow her and
find out what she s up to 
you just want
to follow her 
no 
you re thinking
with your dick 
they left their
land rover here 
they re probably
headed for the border 
it would save us
a lot of trouble 
they seem to be headed
in that direction 
maybe your dick s
not so dumb 
got me through
high school 
do you think those men
are following us 
they re most likely
chitrali nomads 
not to worry 
did you say sit 
i didn t say sit 
did you say sit 
no  i didn t say sit 
what  
now what 
i guess we walk 
why do we have to carry
all this stuff 
the dushanbe road runs across
the top of the mountains 
it ll be sub arctic
temperatures up there 
you ll thank me

that s it 
the dushanbe road

only insofar as it
serves to confirm
the president s
own beliefs 
this is quite
an exciting project 
what was the cost of
this star wars system 
just under
 60 billion 
quite a bargain

pissed off

our first priority

establish
a new base camp

this project 
fitz hume s

seize that rocket 
we d have to kill
everybody down there 
i m not
killing anybody

gentlemen  i think
you both should realize
the gravity
of this moment 
i ve spent the last
2 1 2 years of my life
preparing for
this penetration 
this afternoon  i buried
my partner jerry hadley 
perhaps the finest 
most dedicated glg 20
in the history
of the service 
he is now entombed
in a snowy grave 
and it s not gonna be
for nothing 
we are here today
to guarantee
the personal freedom
of every american 
and we should never forget
the words of president
john f  kennedy
who said  ask not what
your country can do for you 
but what you can do
for your country  
will you marry me 
now   
these are high compression
tranquilizer pistols 
we re not going
to kill anybody 
but you ve got to get

when she was a child
in lithuania 
her uncle used to tell a story
about strange beings
that came down from
a disc and stole an ox
which the village had
put aside for roasting 
i told you
it would work 
everybody knows
about ufos 
apparently  the aliens
dissected the ox
and kept the best pieces
of meat for themselves 
so we owe them
a cow

we would do such a thing 
tell her
so do we 
what are they
saying 
it s 4 47 a  m 
they re saying it ll be
28 minutes
before the rocket detonates
above its target
somewhere inside
the continental united states 
let s see  28 minutes 
that s 18 until it s
inside the u  s  radar cup 
figure 2

say 20 until
total commitment 
figure 20 22
until the first impact
of our retaliatory strike 
i figure
we have 42 minutes
until the end of civilization
as we know it 
you want to go out
with a bang 
i beg your pardon 
it was just an idea 
you know  if we were
sitting in a bar 
i d throw a drink
right in your face   
but under
the circumstances 
it s not such
a bad idea 
release full pulse

just what are you
saying  soldier 
we missed it  sir 
what 
we missed the rocket 
it didn t work 
didn t work 
where did the pulse go 
i don t know  sir  but
it definitely didn t connect
with the inbound traffic 
wow 
excellent 
we d better
call the president 
we re not calling anyone 
what do you mean 
we re not calling anyone 
the president must know
that this attack
was not initiated
by the soviet union 
we are prepared
for this contingency 
what in hell do you
intend to do 
you understand  sir 
that we are responsible
for launching a nuclear weapon
against our own country 
no one outside
this command center
has that information 
gentlemen 
when we commissioned
the schmectel corporation
to research this precise
event sequence scenario 
it was determined that
the continual stockpiling
and development
of our nuclear arsenal
was becoming
self defeating 
a weapon unused
is a useless weapon 
sac com confirms
all defense systems
commitment ready 
we have verification 
the president is aboard
the airborne command center 
i m sure it will only be
a matter of minutes
before the president
commits to total release 
jesus christ 
you see  we had to show
that we had
the technical capability
and were determined 
history demonstrates
conclusively
that naive
wishing for peace
is the surest
possible way
to encourage
an aggressor 
i demand you place me
in immediate communication
with the president 
relax  mr  ruby 
this facility is more than
adequately stocked
for a comfortable 17 months
of below ground existence 
we ll be fine 
by your actions  sir 
you are risking the future
of the human race 
to guarantee
the american way of life   
i m willing
to take that risk 
it s hard to believe
it s been only 15 minutes
since i destroyed
the world 
in another 15 minutes 
it will all be over 
it s such a short time
to destroy a world 
and to think my high school
guidance counselor
said i d never
amount to anything 
it just goes to show

it s made to respond
to in flight commands 
here s a rock 
go to the satscram
terminal 
now what 
smash that thing 
it s broken 
bring it here 
not the rock 
what s the use  it s
probably all over anyway 
no  no  no 
all we have to do is
switch sending boards 
ok 
start sending the launch
sequence in reverse order 
yes  sir 
fitz hume
