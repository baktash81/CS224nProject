for those few music lovers who have
never attended one of his concerts

tracing his meteoric rise 
and that   that is
our army s newest weapon 
private birdie reports
for his induction in ten days 
his income drops

kelsey  judge blanch  joe kipp 
my biggest customers  they don t approve
ot this kind ot notorious goings on 
darling  they put pressure on you 
lf l don t cancel this whole birdie
deal  they ll starve me out of business 
  oh  my heavens 
  lt s them or us

smart boy you have there  it isn t
every lad who can make a stench bomb 
  which brings me to mr  birdie 
  mr  peterson is really a biochemist 
  l couldn t care less 
  l have one tormula  a secret 
lt s miraculous because it increases
the work output of domestic animals 
  now about this birdie 
  lt speeds up the reflexes 
an ox  for instance 
could outrun a racehorse 
by adding in his tormula 
a hen will lay three eggs a day 
three eggs a day  lt that s so 
you could make a million times  
l ve been nursing
this compound for years 
  still needs more tests  but it works 
  aren t you in farming

lt you and albert got together 
you could revolutionize farm production 
would you like a demonstration 
do you have a hen 
  how about trying it on that 
  a tortoise  l don t know 
sure  lt won t bite 
here  let me 
ot course  there isn t
much demand for turtle eggs 
but if it really works
on tarm animals   
maybe you and me
could do some business 
l ll sure need something it l let kim
go through with this birdie stutf 
some of harry s customers
are against it
