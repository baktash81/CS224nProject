sweet sue thinks too

if someone wants one of us 
they get both of us

about sweet sue 
what 
she looks just like you 
so  how much further

jesus  mary and joseph 
you re worse than the children  sister 
the mullins agreeing to take
us in was a gift from god 
what kind of person isn t
excited about getting a gift 
i should mention
don t be alarm if you

this is our new orphanage 
i think this is fine if
we re never being adopted 
there s a tv 
the television no longer works 
the radio however does 
this goes on forever 
you re right  we re going to need
a map to find our way around 
girls  this way 
as you can see  the dining room
is more than adequate
to accommodate all of us 
wow

mrs mullins and i stay in here

downstairs as you see fit 
your rooms are upstairs 
mr mullins

we ll only get in the way 
  fine 
  she said okay 
but look out for one another

amen

in here
nancy 
carol 
are you guys in here 
forgive me  father 
for i am about to sin 
i think this is where
mr mullins keeps his wife 
does she really wear a mask 
yeah  she looked like a doll 
mrs mullins 
you down there 
stop it 
i think he seems nice 
why don t you go find janice 
see what she s up to 
why 
so you can talk about boys 
well  do you want to
talk about boys 
gross 
no 
i want to play a game 
okay 
let s play hide and seek 
you go hide and
we ll come look for you 
okay 
so  are we going to
look for her 
maybe 
bless you 
thank you 
what are you doing 
i asked mr mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom
and he graciously agreed 
would you like to help 
what s wrong 
i have a sin to confess 
forgive me  sister charlotte 
for i have sinned 
   it s been   
  at least 2 weeks 
    at least 2 weeks
since my last confession 
there s this room upstairs
i m not suppose to go into 
but you did anyway 
how did you know 
because otherwise why would
you be telling me about it 
well  the door was already opened 
i don t know how because
mr mullins always keeps it locked 
when i went inside
there was this little doll 
  and it was really strange 
  janice 
weird things started to happen 
janice  listen to yourself 
what do i always say 
a sin is a sin
no matter the context 
more importantly  you absolutely
cannot disobey the mullins 
we only just got here and
they re doing a very generous thing
by allowing us
to stay with them 
if they decide to
no longer have us here   
we ll all be split up 
so next time you re thinking
of breaking a rule 
think of how that could ve affect
the other girls first 
do you understand me 
yes 
i m sorry  sister  i wasn t thinking 
it s okay  love 
for your penance 
pray 1 hail mary
and unpack 3 of these boxes 
what are you guys doing 
unpacking boxes 
oh 
this place is so creepy 
what was that 
what was that 
how dare you 
oh  mr scarecrow 
oh 
found you 
you re not very good at hiding 
years of neglect have
affected the counter balance 
there 
that should keep the draft out 
thank you 
that was taken in romania 
at a convent of cloistered nuns 
they have little contact
with the outside world
but i became very close
to these three 
that s sister maria 
that s sister anna 
and that s sister lucia 
who s this 
   valak   
i    don t know 
i don t think i even met her 
is there anything else you need 
no 
thank you 
good night 
good night 
uuu 
i like him 
which one would you marry 
oh 
i don t know 
i guess i ll just have to date
all of them to find out 
how do you like his eyebrows 
  his eye 
  ain t he handsome 
night time is when mrs mullins
gets her powers 
that s why she s in bed all day 
but at night   
she can go wherever she wants 
she needs to
so she can feed 
and if you look directly
at her you ll die 
and to get you to look 
she ll keep saying your name
over and over
till you can t stand it 
nancy 
nancy 
  nancy   
  no  no 
nancy 
no 
she s ready to feed 
carol 
carol 
carol 
hey  we re not suppose to be up 
  well  you ll do it to 
  hey 
why isn t he answering her 
  it s her 
  don t look at her 
no 
no 
please please please   
please 
please 
she s gone 
she s gone 
she s gone 
what s going on 
what on god s earth 
  sister charlotte 
  mrs mullins 
she was here 
we heard 
in this room 
she was standing right over there 
who 
your wife apparently 
they said she was
just in here 
oh  that s impossible 
my wife hasn t been
able to walk for years 
girls 
girls 
let s go back to our studies  okay 
you okay  nance 
did you really see mrs mullins
in your room last night 
yes 
we swear we were under the cover and   
nancy 
stop it 
we just freaked ourselves out
last night  you know that 
mrs mullins 
sister charlotte 
could i trouble you
for a glass of water 
of course 
it s good to hear
some life again 
i ve been cooped up here so long
i forgotten what that sounded like 
what a lovely picture 
she was taken from us
at an early age    unfortunately 
if you could turn away
for a moment  sister 
yes  of course 
i m very sorry to hear
about your daughter 
but we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in heaven 
i wish that were true 
oh my gosh 
you shouldn t be in here 
well  neither should you 
who s room is this anyways 
the mullins had a daughter 
it was her s 
had one 
i think she died 
and i think that was her
playing the music too 
stop trying to scare me 
i m not 
it s the truth 
then why are we in here 
  we should leave 
  no 
oh 
linda 
what is it 
we shouldn t be in here 
okay 
i ll leave in a minute 
well  i m going 
dear diary  today i came home
who s doing that 
hi 
you re the mullins  daughter   
aren t you 
what happened to you 
will you help me 
what do you need 
your soul 
charlotte 
sister charlotte 
no 
how do you feel 
give her some space 
girls 
janice is feeling
a little down right now 
so  we need to do
what we can to support her 
time i think
is all she needs 
she ll walk again  right 
we ll have to see 
you need sleep 
that s going to help you
with the healing 
i can t stay here  sister charlotte 
we can t stay here 
we need to leave 
leave 
and go where 
there isn t anywhere else
for us to go 
i didn t fall down those stairs 
something threw me 
what do you mean 
you always say that
even though we can t see god
we can   
we can feel his presence 
well   
in this house i feel
a different kind of presence 
what kind 
an evil one 
it s coming after me 
coming after my soul 
you soul 
because i m the weakest 
no  darling 
listen 
the devil preys on
those weak in faith 
not weak of flesh and bone 
you are as strong
as any of us  janice 
stronger 
you re quiet  samuel 
i think it was a mistake   
to bring the girls here 
why 
the girl    
the girl that fell 
maybe she didn t fall 
maybe   
it was an accident 
that s all it was 
accidents happen 
it s been quiet for 12 years 
you should try embracing
the presence of the girls   
instead of frightening them away 
you ll be better soon 
i don t think so 
not this time 
but you have too 
you said we ll find
a new home 
no one is going to
want me now 
i ll just be a burden 
but you swore we ll stick together 
i take it back 
maybe i won t get adopted 
you will 
you know why 
because you re special 
you re going to get adopted by
a nice family somewhere
and they re going to
spoil you so much 
you re going to have
so many dolls that   
you won t even be able to
name all of them 
sure i can 
janice one 
janice two 
janice three 
linda 
time for bed 
won t you come upstairs 
i don t want to sleep alone 
here 
take becca 
this way 
i ll always be with you 
then  you should have sweet sue 
thank you 
remember before
all of this 
when we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night 
and ate all the chocolate
in the pantry 
father massey was convinced
that we had mice 
oh lord  please cleanse
my soul of my sins
and cleanse our house of   
  these mice 
  these mice 
whatever happens   
i m thinking always
all those things we did together 
good night  linda 
good night  janice 
a little sunlight will
do you some good 
i don t the sunlight can fix
what s wrong with me 
you mustn t give up hope 
hope is a home onto itself 
dwell in it and it will
protect and keep you 
what book of the bible
is that from 
the book of charlotte 
but that doesn t
make it any less so 
are you okay here 
the sunlight actually
feels kind of nice 
i told you 
that s too low 
sister charlotte 
no  no  no 
no 
please 
janice 
janice 
what s going on 
i couldn t get out 
are you okay 
i m fine 
i m worry about janice 
a few nights ago
she wanted to leave 
why she want to leave 
probably because this place
is off the wall 
she told me the mullins s daughter
was coming for her 
the mullins  had a daughter 
she died a long time ago 
so  she s seeing ghost 
keep your voice down 
so  she s seeing ghost 
i guess 
well   
you guys saw something 
that wasn t a ghost 
ghost can only be
of dead people 
how does that explain
what you saw 
unless it really was mrs mullins 
or   
something was just trying to scare you 
you guys are doing a good job
with that on your own 
janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently 
i don t think so 
of course you don t 
you ll know what i mean
when you re older 
now go get to bed 
what are you waiting for 
nothing 
you like it 
it s nice 
it s not my finest work 
you seem troubled 
maybe i can help 
i don t think so 
talking about the things
that bothers us sometimes   
all the help we need 
well   
it s janice 
she s acting funny 
acting funny 
she says   
she s seen your daughter 
my daughter   
has been dead for a
very very long time 
i know  but   
you see 
janice went into her bedroom 
she what 
she knows she wasn t suppose to
but   
  she found this doll and   
  what doll 
the one in the white dress 
that s impossible 
that doll was hidden away 
she mustn t go near that doll 
you understand me 
found you
janice  i told you
not to use that room 
please don t take
my sunshine away   
ahhh 
stay here 
mr mullins 
mr mullins  are you okay 
go get ready for bed  girls 
i need to speak to mrs mullins 
linda 
what are you doing 
this doll 
it s hurting janice
and it killed mr mullins 
i m getting rid of it 
linda  let s go back 
linda 
no 
what is that 
who cares 
run 
janice  janice 
i got rid of it 
i got rid of the doll 
janice 
janice 
  what s going on 
  where is janice 
  i don t know 
  go find her 
hurry 
what s going on 
no 
no 
get that thing away from me 
it s back 
i know it was back 
what is it 
evil 
the devil itself 
what are you talking about 
after samuel and i   
lost our daughter
we prayed and promised
our devotion to
whatever power that
would allow us to
speak or see our
beloved girl again 
it started small 
the contact 
but it was her 
our busy bee 
we know it was her 
she wanted permission
to move into the doll
so she could be
with us forever 
please
we said yes 
and that s when it became stronger 
soon we can actually see her 
only in fleeting glimpses
but it was enough 
our beloved bee 
our darling 
annabelle 
even though i couldn t hold her 
it was comforting to start
the past activity again 
but we soon realised
it wasn t our annabelle at all 
you are my sunshine 
my only sunshine
you make me happy    
when skies are gray
you ll never know dear 
how much i love you
please don t take my sunshine away
esther 
esther 
my    eye   
it was a demonic presence 
and it was using our
annabelle to manipulate us
into giving it soul
it couldn t have 
it tried to take mine 
but samuel reached out
to the church 
they saved my soul
but the evil was still
attached to that doll 
so we locked it away
where it could be surrounded
by the word of god 
it was quiet
for all these year 
i thought the evil was contained 
we thought helping the girls
could be our penance 
but we end up giving it
just what it wanted 
you are my sunshine 
my only sunshine
you make me happy
when skies are gray
  you ll never know dear 
  janice 
how much i love you
please don t take my sunshine away
she can walk 
it s just us  janice
