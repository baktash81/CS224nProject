theres a tv
the television no longer works
the radio however does
this goes on forever
youre right were going to need
a map to find our way around
girls this way
as you can see the dining room
is more than adequate
to accommodate all of us
wow

mrs mullins and i stay in here
fell free to use the rest of the
downstairs as you see fit
your rooms are upstairs
mr mullins

but even if they dont
thats okay too
amen

in here
nancy
carol
are you guys in here
forgive me father
for i am about to sin
i think this is where
mr mullins keeps his wife
does she really wear a mask
yeah she looked like a doll
mrs mullins
you down there
stop it
i think he seems nice
why dont you go find janice
see what shes up to
why
so you can talk about boys
well do you want to
talk about boys
gross
no
i want to play a game
okay
lets play hide and seek
you go hide and
well come look for you
okay
so are we going to
look for her
maybe
bless you
thank you
what are you doing
i asked mr mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom
and he graciously agreed
would you like to help
whats wrong
i have a sin to confess
forgive me sister charlotte
for i have sinned
its been
at least 2 weeks
at least 2 weeks
since my last confession
theres this room upstairs
im not suppose to go into
but you did anyway
how did you know
because otherwise why would
you be telling me about it
well the door was already opened
i dont know how because
mr mullins always keeps it locked
when i went inside
there was this little doll
and it was really strange
janice
weird things started to happen
janice listen to yourself
what do i always say
a sin is a sin
no matter the context
more importantly you absolutely
cannot disobey the mullins
we only just got here and
theyre doing a very generous thing
by allowing us
to stay with them
if they decide to
no longer have us here
well all be split up
so next time youre thinking
of breaking a rule
think of how that couldve affect
the other girls first
do you understand me
yes
im sorry sister i wasnt thinking
its okay love
for your penance
pray 1 hail mary
and unpack 3 of these boxes
what are you guys doing
unpacking boxes
oh
this place is so creepy
what was that
what was that
how dare you
oh mr scarecrow
oh
found you
youre not very good at hiding
years of neglect have
affected the counter balance
there
that should keep the draft out
thank you
that was taken in romania
at a convent of cloistered nuns
they have little contact
with the outside world
but i became very close
to these three
thats sister maria
thats sister anna
and thats sister lucia
whos this
valak
i dont know
i dont think i even met her
is there anything else you need
no
thank you
good night
good night
uuu
i like him
which one would you marry
oh
i dont know
i guess ill just have to date
all of them to find out
how do you like his eyebrows
his eye
aint he handsome
night time is when mrs mullins
gets her powers
thats why shes in bed all day
but at night
she can go wherever she wants
she needs to
so she can feed
and if you look directly
at her youll die
and to get you to look
shell keep saying your name
over and over
till you cant stand it
nancy
nancy

sister charlotte
mrs mullins

in this room
she was standing right over there
who
your wife apparently
they said she was
just in here
oh thats impossible
my wife hasnt been
able to walk for years
girls
girls
lets go back to our studies okay
you okay nance
did you really see mrs mullins
in your room last night
yes
we swear we were under the cover and
nancy
stop it
we just freaked ourselves out
last night you know that
mrs mullins
sister charlotte
could i trouble you
for a glass of water
of course
its good to hear
some life again
ive been cooped up here so long
i forgotten what that sounded like
what a lovely picture
she was taken from us
at an early age unfortunately
if you could turn away
for a moment sister
yes of course
im very sorry to hear
about your daughter
but we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in heaven
i wish that were true
oh my gosh
you shouldnt be in here
well neither should you
whos room is this anyways
the mullins had a daughter
it was hers
had one
i think she died
and i think that was her
playing the music too
stop trying to scare me
im not
its the truth
then why are we in here
we should leave
no
oh
linda
what is it
we shouldnt be in here
okay
ill leave in a minute
well im going
dear diary today i came home
whos doing that
hi
youre the mullins daughter
arent you
what happened to you
will you help me
what do you need
your soul
charlotte
sister charlotte
no
how do you feel
give her some space
girls
janice is feeling
a little down right now
so we need to do
what we can to support her
time i think
is all she needs
shell walk again right
well have to see
you need sleep
thats going to help you
with the healing
i cant stay here sister charlotte
we cant stay here
we need to leave
leave
and go where
there isnt anywhere else
for us to go
i didnt fall down those stairs
something threw me
what do you mean
you always say that
even though we cant see god
we can
we can feel his presence
well
in this house i feel
a different kind of presence
what kind
an evil one
its coming after me
coming after my soul
you soul
because im the weakest
no darling
listen
the devil preys on
those weak in faith
not weak of flesh and bone
you are as strong
as any of us janice
stronger
youre quiet samuel
i think it was a mistake
to bring the girls here
why
the girl
the girl that fell
maybe she didnt fall
maybe
it was an accident
thats all it was
accidents happen
its been quiet for 12 years
you should try embracing
the presence of the girls
instead of frightening them away
youll be better soon
i dont think so
not this time
but you have too
you said well find
a new home
no one is going to
want me now
ill just be a burden
but you swore well stick together
i take it back
maybe i wont get adopted
you will
you know why
because youre special
youre going to get adopted by
a nice family somewhere
and theyre going to
spoil you so much
youre going to have
so many dolls that
you wont even be able to
name all of them
sure i can
janice one
janice two
janice three
linda
time for bed
wont you come upstairs
i dont want to sleep alone
here
take becca
this way
ill always be with you
then you should have sweet sue
thank you
remember before
all of this
when we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night
and ate all the chocolate
in the pantry
father massey was convinced
that we had mice
oh lord please cleanse
my soul of my sins
and cleanse our house of
these mice
these mice
whatever happens
im thinking always
all those things we did together
good night linda
good night janice
a little sunlight will
do you some good
i dont the sunlight can fix
whats wrong with me
you mustnt give up hope
hope is a home onto itself
dwell in it and it will
protect and keep you
what book of the bible
is that from
the book of charlotte
but that doesnt
make it any less so
are you okay here
the sunlight actually
feels kind of nice
i told you
thats too low
sister charlotte
no no no
no
please
janice
janice
whats going on
i couldnt get out
are you okay
im fine
im worry about janice
a few nights ago
she wanted to leave
why she want to leave
probably because this place
is off the wall
she told me the mullinss daughter
was coming for her
the mullins had a daughter
she died a long time ago
so shes seeing ghost
keep your voice down
so shes seeing ghost
i guess
well
you guys saw something
that wasnt a ghost
ghost can only be
of dead people
how does that explain
what you saw
unless it really was mrs mullins
or
something was just trying to scare you
you guys are doing a good job
with that on your own
janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently
i dont think so
of course you dont
youll know what i mean
when youre older
now go get to bed
what are you waiting for
nothing
you like it
its nice
its not my finest work
you seem troubled
maybe i can help
i dont think so
talking about the things
that bothers us sometimes
all the help we need
well
its janice
shes acting funny
acting funny
she says
shes seen your daughter
my daughter
has been dead for a
very very long time
i know but
you see
janice went into her bedroom
she what
she knows she wasnt suppose to
but
she found this doll and
what doll
the one in the white dress
thats impossible
that doll was hidden away
she mustnt go near that doll
you understand me
found you
janice i told you
not to use that room
please dont take
my sunshine away
ahhh
stay here
mr mullins
mr mullins are you okay
go get ready for bed girls
i need to speak to mrs mullins
linda
what are you doing
this doll
its hurting janice
and it killed mr mullins
im getting rid of it
linda lets go back
linda
no
what is that
who cares
run
janice janice
i got rid of it
i got rid of the doll
janice
janice
whats going on
where is janice
i dont know
go find her
hurry
whats going on
no
no
get that thing away from me
its back
i know it was back
what is it
evil
the devil itself
what are you talking about
after samuel and i
lost our daughter
we prayed and promised
our devotion to
whatever power that
would allow us to
speak or see our
beloved girl again
it started small
the contact
but it was her
our busy bee
we know it was her
she wanted permission
to move into the doll
so she could be
with us forever
please
we said yes
and thats when it became stronger
soon we can actually see her
only in fleeting glimpses
but it was enough
our beloved bee
our darling
annabelle
even though i couldnt hold her
it was comforting to start
the past activity again
but we soon realised
it wasnt our annabelle at all
you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy
when skies are gray
youll never know dear
how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away
esther
esther
my eye
it was a demonic presence
and it was using our
annabelle to manipulate us
into giving it soul
it couldnt have
it tried to take mine
but samuel reached out
to the church
they saved my soul
but the evil was still
attached to that doll
so we locked it away
where it could be surrounded
by the word of god
it was quiet
for all these year
i thought the evil was contained
we thought helping the girls
could be our penance
but we end up giving it
just what it wanted
you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy
when skies are gray
youll never know dear
janice
how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away
she can walk
its just us janice
time to cease from sin carol
