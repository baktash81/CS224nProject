im trying to drink my brandy
after a very long day
i simply wasnt certain
whether this was something you wanted
to take care of personally
leder there are what four million
negroes in this country
why on earth should i concern
myself with these fortyfour hmm
well there are reasons
i dont care how
you just take care of it
the ship is amistad
its too small to be
a transatlantic slaver
theyre plantation slaves then
west indians
not necessarily
at least they certainly
dont look it
not from the glimpse i caught of them
on their way to jail
they have thesescars
scars
yeah
church bell strikes
they were first detained by officers
of a brig off long island
they were conveyed to new haven
under what authority i dont know
and given over to
the local constabulary
about forty of them
including four or five children
the arraignment
is day after tomorrow
i can only assume that
the charge is murder
ill see what i can do about that
perhaps a writ for illegal arrest
and detainment to stall things
at the very least
make sure they have good counsel
native language chief chief
hes not a chief
brother brother
hes not your brother
what is he then
hes a white man

of piracy and murder
i have a petition for
a writ of habeas corpus
i was speaking
mr holabird your charges whatever
they might be will be rendered moot
that petition mr tappan
if thats what it is  is moot
until an actual writ by some higher
court by some miracle is granted
mr holabird is correct
and if you would sir
please kindly refrain from
impersonating a lawyer
which you patently are not
as i was saying your honour
your honour

my name is roger s baldwin
attorneyatlaw
real estate
real estate inventories
and other assets
can i help you with something
what is it that you do
well i own various business
and banks
as a matter of fact you probably
could help me mr tappan chuckles
but thats not why im here
id like to help you
me
yes i deal with property
sometimes i get peoples
property back
other times i get it taken away
as in this case
every one of the claims speaks
to the issue of ownership
thank you mrmr baldwin
baldwin roger s attorneyatlaw
chuckles but im afraid whats
needed here is a criminal attorney
a trial lawyer
but thanks for your interest
yes well
intending no disrespect mr tappan
but if that were the way to go
well then
well i wouldnt have bothered
coming down here
tappan laughs
goodbye i bid you gentlemen
a good afternoon
in closing
i call upon our distinguished
colleague from massachusetts
representative john quincy adams
to reweigh his unmeet
and unprecedented attempt
to convert this eccentric
bequest of  lets be frank
a bunch of junk of
one james smithson
into a socalled institute
of national treasure
man coughs
perhaps mr adams is meditating
on his response
laughter
had i thought your remarks worthy
of riposte representative pinckney
be assured youd have heard
from mehours ago
who
mr tappan lewis tappan
yeah
i must see him
im required to see him
no sir he requests an audience
give me your hand
oh he requests does he
yeah i dont know
anyone called tappan
sir you do youve met him often
where
where is he
hes right over there sir
oh
what is that
coin clinking
where
right there sir
lewis good to see you again
and you sir
laughs
this is theodore joadson
how do you do sir
an honour to meet you sir
yeah
sir is there somewhere
lets stroll in the garden
yes
what
let go of my arm over here
tappan this case has
great significance
our secretary of state
is paying it his attention
adams you dont have to shout
tappan he supports the queens
claim that she owns the africans
two sailors are making claims
adams what season is it
pardon
i said what season is it
i dont understand what you mean
there are two ways of knowing
without consulting a calendar
the leaves on the maple trees
have all gone
and the fact that the president is
not at home on pennsylvania avenue
tell me sir
do you really think van buren
cares about the whims
of an 11yearold girl
who wears a tiara
i assure you only one thing occupies
his thoughts this time of the year
being all things to all people
which means nothing to no one
in other words
gettin himself reelected
give me a hand
huh
will you help us sir
let go of my arm
take my stick
mr adams
yeah what
as an advocate for the abolition
of slavery will you help us
im neither friend nor foe to the
abolitionist cause i wont help you
joadson sir
what
i know you mr president
i know you and your presidency as
well as any man and your fathers
you were a child at his side
when he helped invent america
you in turn have devoted your life
to refining that noble invention
there remains but one task undone
one vital task the founding
fathers left to their sons
before their 13 colonies could
precisely be called united states
and that task sir as you
well know is crushing slavery
your record confirms youre an
abolitionist sir even if you wont
and whether or not you admit it
mr joadson
you belong with us
sniffs
youre quite the scholar
mr joadson arent ya
quite the historian
let me tell you about
that quality if i might
without an accompanying mastery of at
least onetenth its measure of grace
such erudition is worthless sir
now you take it from one who knows
if you gentlemen will excuse me
sniffs
we know we aimed high asking you
well aim lower
find yourselves someone
whose inspiration blossoms
the more you lose
joadson if the court
awards them to spain
theyll be taken to cuba
and executed
if the two lieutenants prevail
theyll likely to sell them to spain
and theyll be executed
if montes and ruiz are successful
im a little confused
what are they worth to you
were discussing the case
not its expense
of course well the case is much
simpler than you think mr tappan
its like anything  land
livestock heirlooms what have you
livestock
yes consider
the only way one may sell or purchase
slaves is if they are born slaves
as on the plantation
im right arent i
yes
so are they
are they
yes born slaves
as on a plantation
were not certain
but we very much doubt it
lets say they are
then they are possessions
and no more deserving of
a criminal trial than a bookcase
on the other hand
lets say they arent slaves
in which case they were
illegally acquired
forget mutiny forget piracy
forget murder
those are irrelevant occurrences
ignore everything but
the preeminent issue at hand
the wrongful transfer
of stolen goods
either way we win
sir this war must be waged on
the battlefield of righteousness
the what
it would be against
everything i stand for
to let this deteriorate into
an exercise in legal minutia
mr tappan im talking about
the heart of the matter
as am i
it is our destiny
as abolitionists and as christians
to save these people
these are people mr baldwin
not livestock
did christ hire a lawyer
to get him off on technicalities
he went to the cross nobly
you know why
to make a statement
to make a statement as must we
but christ lost
you i think
no sir he did not
you want to win dont you
yes
i certainly do hell sometimes
i dont get paid unless i do
which brings us back to
the question of worth
in order to do a better job
than the son of gods attorney
ill require two and a
half dollars a day
mende who are they do you think
looks like theyre going to be sick
all  amazing grace
how sweet the sound
mende theyre entertainers
that saved a wretch like me
but why do they look so miserable
i once was lost
but now am found
mende you dont belong here
your table doesnt belong here

im sorry i dont understand
excuse me i
my name is roger baldwin
this is theodore joadson
of the antislavery society
and owner of the forten
shipping service
and this is professor gibbs
a linguist
mende what do you want
keep talking get them to talk
have you seen this before
mende i could kill you with my bare
hands before you raise that sword
this belongs to you
makes slashing sounds
gibbs makes slashing sound
no
umm
i need to know where youre from
gibbs uh
speaks african dialect
mende what did he say
mende i didnt understand a word
its gibberish
he said i think show me the map
mende do you think
hes here to help us
i dont know
he reminds me of that fula of baoma
the one who hires himself out to
scrape elephant dung from the crops
a dungscraper might be just the kind
of man we need right now
baldwin here africa
is this where youre from
africa
mende what does he want
mende hes an idiot
were you born in the west indies
spanish
were you born in the west indies
mende all three of them are idiots
what did he say
oh he said er
they have to go away
shouting
emancipation its gods way
you cannot own another human being
killers of white men
slavery is tyranny
mende its those miserablelooking
people again
gods blessing on you this morning
mende im not afraid of you
or your medicine
yes you place your hand on
this book and ill pray for you
woman in crowd theyre
human beings not animals
man slavery will kill this country
slaves chatter
holabird in the
quietude of the night
after the spaniards attended their
vespers and were in virtuous sleep
the savages broke loose
their collars
and stole onto the deck
like creatures of prey
they fell upon the unsuspecting crew
with these sabres and cane knives
gasps from gallery
i cannot overstate
mende have you
figured out who he is
mende an advisor of some kind
perhaps theirs
they mutilated at least one
mende what about him
the simple cook a creole
their own kind
mende theirs maybe
but for senors ruiz and montes
who steered the amistad
to these shores
under constant threat of like fate
we might never have heard of
this massacre this bloodbath
but for their bravery these villains
would have escaped justice
but theyve not theyve not
mende and dungscraper
i have a horrible feeling
he talks for us
whispering
do you know the difference
between a cow and a cabbage
a brick and a bear
or how about
a polecat and a president
the spanish government hopes you
dont have much more sense than that
this case isnt about murder
mayhem or massacres
its not about anything
that dramatic
this case is about knowing the
difference between here and there
i want to show you something
prisoners protest
open your mouth
he doesnt understand
he doesnt speak english
abra su boca
replies in mende
doesnt he understand i thought
he was born on a cuban plantation
perhaps he simply doesnt like you
he wouldnt be the first
mr holabird
laughs yes
what did he learn this on some cuban
plantation this decorative effect
muttering cuban plantation
stand up stand up
hey levantate
levantate
protests
levantate
sighs
stand up
all ahh
thank you
your honour i speak more spanish
and i was born in philadelphia
on spanish plantations
slaves choose to live
surrounded by their own ways
and simple languages
pray tell what need they know
of spanish fetch carry stop
gestures suffice for slaves
as for any other beast of burden
your honour
i represent the interests
of senors ruiz and montes
i remember
i have a bill of sale
issued in havana
for the purchase of slaves
i remember that too
on it in addition to the amounts
paid for each are their names
jose bernardo
paco and so on
on behalf of my clients i submit
this document to the court
mr baldwin youve proffered
a good deal of  ill be kind
circumstantial evidence
have you in addition anything in
the order of actual documentation
that might refute this one
and so more compellingly
support your claims
im sure i could manufacture some
as easily as they have your honour
what youre saying is
then you dont
is that correct
i have them
im afraid that does not impress me
i thought you did quite well
you do
much better than i expected
to be honest
well thank you i think
although i was concerned that
you might have forgotten
this is just a case like any other
you neednt worry about that
thats good
prisoner speaks menacingly

cinque in mende
thisis how far ive come
arguing in spanish
man secure the ballast transport
put your backs into it boys
this is a court order granting us
permission to search this vessel
what did they want
to come aboard
i informed them they needed to obtain
one of thesean authentic one
arent you coming
arguing continues
man distant heaveho
gasping my light light
light the lamp mr baldwin
im trying
grunts
mr joadson
here
are you all right
panting yes
grunts
these papers  and i shall
ask you to examine them
are portions of a ships manifest i
retrieved from the amistad yesterday
at first glance they may appear
to bolster the prosecutions case
you see they list cargo
cargo bearing the very spanish names
messrs ruiz and montes
insist represent my clients
handscrawled in the margins
but no this is not the manifest
of the amistad at all look
this is part of the cargo manifest
of a portuguese vessel
the notorious transatlantic
slave ship the tecora
the tecora
disgruntled murmuring
i can bring you as many witnesses
as you wish mr holabird
tecora
their clients trade primarily off
the coast of west africa
the ivory coast sierra leone
i know what youre thinking
sierra leone is a protectorate
of the british crown
slavery is outlawed there
its principal port in fact
has been rechristened freetown
how then can the
portuguese tecora
engage in the slave trades
in these waters
ill tell you how in a word
illegally
whatever these men say
clearly matters not
because this proves them liars
my clients journey
did not begin in havana
as they keep claiming more
and more emphatically
no my clients journey
began much much further away
i underestimated you sir laughs
i really did
i should take that as a compliment
oh you should indeed sir
i cant imagine theres no not
reaching a favourable conclusion
hey hey
aam i bleeding
theres nothing there
what did i do to deserve this
you took the case mr baldwin
you took the case sir
i should take that as a compliment
as you may perceive
i wish you to act promptly
before this matter becomes
a weight on our two countries
uh great countries
our great countries
after all the business of
great countries is to do business
excelente su alteza
slavery is our pillar of
commerce in the new world
without it our goodwill
and excellent trade relations sh
uh should be imperilled
should be imperilled
without it we might
have been denied the glory
of aiding you in your rebellion
against the british
as slaveowning nations
we must together stand firm
speak the words of humaneness
for the masses of your citizens
but hold tightly to the power
that protects them
that power of course
is their wealth
the africans must never go free
with sincerest admiration
isabella the second
queen of all of spain
i am not about to bend to the will
of some pubescent queen
forget about them
theyre unimportant
prepubescent
you need to concern yourself
with what this matter means here
not an ocean away
someone would tell me what it means
leder you yourself
said it was meaningless
well not any more
sighs
john calhoun paid me a visit
oh god
to explain to me why this case
is of much greater import
much greater symbolism to use his
word  to the south than the north
if the africans are executed
the abolitionists will
make good use of it
and yes they will make
some converts
if on the other hand
they are freed
calhoun says the southern states
will so ally themselves against you
that you can forget
about reelection
tuts over this
its worse than that
worse what could be
worse than that
calhoun believes and i am not sure
i can disagree with him
that this could take us all
one long step closer to civil war
this
yes mr president
but all is not lost
the jury appears likely to free them
but juries can be dismissed
they can
but i believe we must go further
and remove the judge
van buren we can do that
leder he could be prevailed upon to
recuse himself for various reasons
with that in mind
ive taken the liberty of
exploring possible replacements
ive found one i strongly
believe to be better
hes young which means he has a
career before him rather than behind
he has yet to feel the hankering
for magnanimous last gestures
for the sake of posterity
and he is monumentally insecure
particularly about
his catholic heritage
hes catholic
his grandfather was catholic
which young mr coglin has striven
all his days to keep quiet
man mr president judge coglin
van buren judge coglin
we are so pleased to meet you
thank you so much for coming
ive been reading in the papers
the continuing saga
of the uh amistad
real papers
chuckles real papers yes sir
tuts yes bad luck
this last unfolding chapter
what to do now eh
which is why i came here
and imposed on you sir
no impositionreally
sighs yeah
how did that uh
how did that young lawyer
take the news
oh in stride sir in stride
the thing is sir
he did everything right
he proved the case
did he
oh yes sir surprisingly he did
hmm good
well hell just have
to do it again then
but like most things it should
be easier second time around
well im afraid it doesnt matter
what he does now sir
rumour has it our next judge
was handpicked by van buren himself
no
im embarrassed to admit that
i was under the misconception
that our executive
and judicial branches were separate
no more so than these mr joadson
no more so than these
so now you know
yes
sir
yeah
mr president if it was you
handling the case
well it isnt me
and thank god for that
rings bell
but if it was sir
huh
what would you do
well when i was an attorney
a long time ago young man
i er i realised
after much trial and error
that in a courtroom
whoever tells
the best story wins
in unlawyerlike fashion i give you
that scrap of wisdom free of charge
im much obliged
for your time sir
what is their story
by the way
sir
what is their story
why theyre um
from west africa
no what is their story
mr joadson youre
from where originally
why georgia sir
georgia
yes sir
does that sum up what you are
a georgian is that your story
no youre an exslave
whos devoted his life
to the abolition of slavery
and overcoming great hardships
along the way i should imagine
thats your story isnt it
laughs
you and this young socalled lawyer
have proven you know what they are
theyre africans congratulations
what you dont know and havent
bothered in the least to discover
is who they are
right

the judge we had
who believed i believe
that you should be freed

a new judge has been called upon
to hear the case
this time without a jury
translates
how is that possible
a chief cannot be replaced
i cant explain it in any way
that you would understand cinque
or me for that matter
only that well it has happened
translates
i am not a great orator
or advisor cinque
im not a big man in my profession
i dont know if i alone can convince
this next judge to set you free
i need your help
when we go to court
i need you to speak
speaks mende
covey im not
an advisor of any kind
i cannot speak for the others
cinque the others they say you can
they say youre the big man here
whispers reply
covey i am not
whats this i hear about a lion
covey translates
they say you alone  alone cinque
slew the most terrifying beast
anyone has ever seen
is it not true
covey
it had killed several people
even hunters among us
everyone including me was afraid
i was lying down with my family
when out of nowhere it appeared
as it came for me
i picked up this big rock
and i threw it
and by some miracle
you see i hit it
he dont know how
that killed it but it did
chuckles a rock
a rock
speaks mende
covey i received the gratitude
of everyone in the village
i was given respect
they treated me
as if i was a prince
they gave me
the fine country cloth
all these things they gave me
i took them all
but i knew
i didnt deserve it
for when i threw that rock at
that beastif i had missed him
he said he wouldnt be here
trying to explain these things
hed just be dead
understand
understand
im not a big man
just a lucky one
i might agree with you cinque
except youre forgetting something
covey translates
the other lion
the amistad cinque
the insurrection
that too was an accident
i hardly think so
translates
that wasnt bravery
any man would do the same
to get back to his family
you yourself would do it
someone said that might be yours
covey translates
