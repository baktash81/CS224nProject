hey 
ninth avenue 
next stop 
hunter s point 
hey 
stand clear of
the closing doors 
shit  shit 
i read it was
a guy in full makeup 
no 
it says right here it was a mask 
either way 
i think it s good for business 
they got clowns on the
front of every newspaper 
big man 
what s the good word 
hey 
hey  arthur 
i heard what happened 
sorry  mate 
yeah 
it doesn t seem fair 
getting fired like that 
did you really
bring a gun
to the children s
hospital  artie 
what the fuck would
you do that for 
is that part of
your new act  arthur 
if your dancing
doesn t do the trick 
you re just gonna
shoot yourself 
why don t you ask
randall about it 
it was his gun 
  what 
  i still owe you for that 
don t i 
what the fuck
are you talking about 
stop talking
out of your ass  art 
oh  no 
i forgot
to punch out 
and as our city
tries to make sense
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week 
we re joined
by thomas wayne 
happy  look 
thomas wayne s on tv 
yes  mother 
thanks for
having me on  chuck 
they re asking him about
those horrible
subway murders 
thank you  thomas 
i know
this is a difficult time
for you 
why him 
looks like
he s gained weight 
yes 
all three worked for wayne investments 
good  decent  educated 
although i didn t know
any of them personally 
like all wayne employees 
past and present 
they re family 
did you hear that 
i told you  we re family 
there now seems to be
a groundswell of anti rich
sentiment in the city 
it s almost as if our
less fortunate residents
are taking the side
of the killer 
yes 
and it s a shame 
it s one
of the reasons why
i m considering
a run for mayor 
gotham s lost its way 
what about
the eyewitness report
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask 
well 
it makes total sense to me 
what kind of coward would do
something that cold blooded 
someone who hides
behind a mask 
someone who is envious
of those more fortunate
than themselves 
yet they re too scared
to show their own face 
and until those kind of
people change for the better 
those of us who have made
something of our lives
will always look
at those who haven t
as nothing but clowns 
thomas wayne 
thank you for coming in this morning 
it s not funny 
i heard this song on
the radio the other day 
and the guy was singing
that his name was carnival 
arthur   
which is crazy 
because that s
my clown name at work 
and until
a little while ago 
it was like
nobody ever saw me 
even i didn t know
if i really existed 
arthur  i have
some bad news for you 
you don t listen 
do you 
i don t think you
ever really hear me 
you just ask the same
questions every week 
 how s your job 
are you having any negative thoughts  
all i have are
negative thoughts 
but you don t
listen anyway 
i said 
for my whole life 
i didn t know
if i even really existed 
but i do 
and people are
starting to notice 
they ve cut our funding 
we re closing down
our offices next week 
the city has cut funding
across the board 
social services is
part of that 
this is the last time
we ll be meeting 
okay 
they don t give a shit about
people like you  arthur 
and they really
don t give a shit
about people
like me  either 
fuck 
how am i supposed to
get my medication now 
who do i talk to 
i m sorry  arthur 
i think    i think most women
look at sex like buying a car 
you know  like 
 can i see myself in this long term  
 is it safe  
 is it reliable  
 could it kill me  
most guys 
we look at sex like parking a car 
we re like 
 there s a spot  
 there s another spot 
that would work  
 oh  i have to pay 
never mind  
 handicapped 
i hope no one sees this  
all right  that s my time 
thank you very much  guys 
one more time
for sam morril  y all 
all right  now

himself as
a lifelong gotham resident
who from a young age
was always told

amid the unrest 
chuck stevens
filed this report 
the anger and resentment
that s been building
in the city for weeks
seems close to exploding 
protesters 
many dressed as clowns 
took to the streets today
in one of several
planned demonstrations
taking on
the city s elite 
including a massive rally
outside
tomorrow night s
benefit at wayne hall 
what s
the point of all this 
  the rich 
  thomas wayne 
that s what this whole
thing is about 
the whole system 
wayne 
who recently announced
he is running for mayor 
will be attending
the benefit 
you might remember
it was thomas wayne
who first referred to
many of gotham s residents
as  clowns  
today  he offered little
in the way of an apology

there s something wrong
with those people 
i am here
to help them 
i m gonna
lift them out of poverty 
help make
their lives better

that we re
all heartbroken
about what s going on
in the city tonight 
but this is how he
wanted to come out 
and honestly 
i think we could all use a good laugh 
so  please welcome  joker 
are you
all right  doctor 
well 
that was quite an entrance 
you okay 
yeah 
this is exactly
how i imagined it 
well  that makes
one of us 
so  can you tell us
about this look 
when we spoke earlier 
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement 
is that right 
that s right  murray 
i m not political 
i m just trying to
make people laugh 
and how s that going for you 
so  i know
you re a comedian 
you been working on
any new material 
you wanna
tell us a joke 
yeah 
okay 
he s got a book 
a book of jokes 
take your time 
we got all night 
okay  okay 
here s one 
knock  knock 
and you had to
look that up 
i want to
get it right 
knock  knock 
who s there 
it s the police  ma am 
your son s been hit
by a drunk driver 
he s dead 
oh  no  no  no 
no  you cannot
joke about that 
yeah  that s
not funny  arthur 
that s not that kind of
humor we do on this show 
okay  i m   
yeah  i m sorry 
it s just  you know 
it s been a rough few weeks  murray 
ever since
i killed those three
wall street guys 
okay  i m waiting
for the punch line 
there is
no punch line 
it s not a joke 
you re serious 
aren t you 
you re telling us
you killed
those three young men
on the subway 
mmm hmm 
and why should
we believe you 
i got nothing
left to lose 
nothing can
hurt me anymore 
my life is
nothing but a comedy 
well  let me
get this straight 
you think that killing
those guys is funny 
i do 
and i m tired of
pretending it s not 
comedy is subjective 
murray 
isn t that
what they say 
all of you 
the system
that knows so much 
you decide
what s right or wrong 
the same way that you
decide what s funny or not 
get him off 
well  okay 
i think i might understand
that you did this to
start a movement 
to become a symbol 
come on  murray 
do i look like
the kind of clown
that could
start a movement 
i killed those guys
because they were awful 
everybody is awful
these days 
it s enough to
make anyone crazy 
okay 
so  that s it  you re crazy 
that s your defense for
killing three young men 
no 
they couldn t carry a
tune to save their lives 
oh  why is everybody so
upset about these guys 
if it was me
dying on the sidewalk 
you d walk
right over me 
i pass you every day 
and you don t notice me 
but these guys  what 
because thomas wayne
went and cried about them on tv 
you have a problem
with thomas wayne  too 
yes  i do 
have you seen what it s
like out there  murray 
do you ever actually
leave the studio 
everybody just yells and
screams at each other 
nobody s civil anymore 
nobody thinks what it s
like to be the other guy 
you think men like
thomas wayne ever think
what it s like to be
someone like me 
to be somebody but themselves 
they don t 
they think that
we ll just sit there
and take it 
like good little boys 
that we won t werewolf
and go wild 
you finished 
i mean  it s so much
self pity  arthur 
you sound like
you re making excuses
for killing
those young men 
not everybody 
and i ll tell you this 
not everyone is awful 
you re awful  murray 
me  i m awful 
oh  yeah 
how am i awful 
playing my video 
inviting me
on this show 
you just wanted to
make fun of me 
you re just like
the rest of them 
you don t know the first
thing about me  pal 
look what happened 
because of what you did  what it led to 
there are riots
out there 
two policemen are
in critical condition 
and you re laughing 
you re laughing 
someone was killed today 
because of what you did 
i know 
how about another joke  murray 
no  i think we ve had
enough of your jokes 
  what do you get   
  i don t think so 
   when you cross
a mentally ill loner
with a society
that abandons him
and treats him
like trash 
call the police  gene 
  i ll tell you what you get 
  call the police 
you get what you
fucking deserve 
good night 
and always remember  that s   
breaking news 
popular tv talk show host 
murray franklin
was shot dead tonight on the
live telecast of his program 
the man who was
introduced by franklin
as  joker  is
currently under arrest 
police led the suspect
handcuffed out of the studio 
   merely just a punch
line to a joke   
you get what
you deserve 
looting and rioting
have intensified here   
   rioting
throughout the city 
   with a society
that abandons him
and treats him
like trash 
this mob of clowns   
   many
wearing clown masks 
if it was me
dying on the sidewalk 
  you d walk right over me 
  to all of
those who have been
ignored by the system 
and always remember 
that s life
