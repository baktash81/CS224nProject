hey
hey arthur
i heard what happened
sorry mate
yeah
it doesnt seem fair
getting fired like that
did you really
bring a gun
to the childrens
hospital artie
what the fuck would
you do that for
is that part of
your new act arthur
if your dancing
doesnt do the trick
youre just gonna
shoot yourself
why dont you ask
randall about it
it was his gun
what
i still owe you for that
dont i
what the fuck
are you talking about
stop talking
out of your ass art
oh no
i forgot
to punch out
and as our city
tries to make sense
of the brutal triple murder
on the subway last week
were joined
by thomas wayne
happy look
thomas waynes on tv
yes mother
thanks for
having me on chuck
theyre asking him about
those horrible
subway murders
thank you thomas
i know
this is a difficult time
for you
why him
looks like
hes gained weight
yes
all three worked for wayne investments
good decent educated
although i didnt know
any of them personally
like all wayne employees
past and present
theyre family
did you hear that
i told you were family
there now seems to be
a groundswell of antirich
sentiment in the city
its almost as if our
less fortunate residents
are taking the side
of the killer
yes
and its a shame
its one
of the reasons why
im considering
a run for mayor
gothams lost its way
what about
the eyewitness report
of the suspect being
a man in a clown mask
well
it makes total sense to me
what kind of coward would do
something that coldblooded
someone who hides
behind a mask
someone who is envious
of those more fortunate
than themselves
yet theyre too scared
to show their own face
and until those kind of
people change for the better
those of us who have made
something of our lives
will always look
at those who havent
as nothing but clowns
thomas wayne
thank you for coming in this morning
its not funny
i heard this song on
the radio the other day
and the guy was singing
that his name was carnival
arthur
which is crazy
because thats
my clown name at work
and until
a little while ago
it was like
nobody ever saw me
even i didnt know
if i really existed
arthur i have
some bad news for you
you dont listen
do you
i dont think you
ever really hear me
you just ask the same
questions every week
hows your job
are you having any negative thoughts
all i have are
negative thoughts
but you dont
listen anyway
i said
for my whole life
i didnt know
if i even really existed
but i do
and people are
starting to notice
theyve cut our funding
were closing down
our offices next week
the city has cut funding
across the board
social services is
part of that
this is the last time
well be meeting
okay
they dont give a shit about
people like you arthur
and they really
dont give a shit
about people
like me either
fuck
how am i supposed to
get my medication now
who do i talk to
im sorry arthur
i think i think most women
look at sex like buying a car
you know like
can i see myself in this longterm
is it safe
is it reliable
could it kill me
most guys
we look at sex like parking a car
were like
theres a spot
theres another spot
that would work
oh i have to pay

handicapped
i hope no one sees this
all right thats my time
thank you very much guys

for cooler heads to prevail
city services
have been affected
and some businesses
have decided
to remain closed
amid the unrest
chuck stevens

the anger and resentment
thats been building
in the city for weeks
seems close to exploding
protesters
many dressed as clowns
took to the streets today
in one of several
planned demonstrations
taking on
the citys elite
including a massive rally
outside
tomorrow nights
benefit at wayne hall
whats
the point of all this
the rich
thomas wayne
thats what this whole
thing is about
the whole system
wayne
who recently announced
he is running for mayor
will be attending
the benefit
you might remember
it was thomas wayne
who first referred to
many of gothams residents
as clowns
today he offered little
in the way of an apology

i will say is
theres something wrong
with those people
i am here
to help them
im gonna
lift them out of poverty
help make
their lives better

this is exactly
how i imagined it
well that makes
one of us
so can you tell us

when we spoke earlier
you mentioned that this look
is not a political statement
is that right
thats right murray
im not political
im just trying to
make people laugh
and hows that going for you
so i know
youre a comedian
you been working on
any new material
you wanna

thats not that kind of
humor we do on this show
okay im
yeah im sorry
its just you know
its been a rough few weeks murray
ever since
i killed those three
wall street guys
okay im waiting
for the punch line
there is
no punch line
its not a joke
youre serious
arent you
youre telling us
you killed
those three young men
on the subway
mmmhmm
and why should
we believe you
i got nothing
left to lose
nothing can
hurt me anymore
my life is
nothing but a comedy
well let me
get this straight
you think that killing
those guys is funny
i do
and im tired of
pretending its not
comedy is subjective
murray
isnt that
what they say
all of you
the system
that knows so much
you decide
whats right or wrong
the same way that you
decide whats funny or not
get him off
well okay
i think i might understand
that you did this to
start a movement
to become a symbol
come on murray
do i look like
the kind of clown
that could
start a movement
i killed those guys
because they were awful
everybody is awful
these days
its enough to
make anyone crazy
okay
so thats it youre crazy
thats your defense for
killing three young men
no
they couldnt carry a
tune to save their lives
oh why is everybody so
upset about these guys
if it was me
dying on the sidewalk
youd walk
right over me
i pass you every day
and you dont notice me
but these guys what
because thomas wayne
went and cried about them on tv
you have a problem
with thomas wayne too
yes i do
have you seen what its
like out there murray
do you ever actually
leave the studio
everybody just yells and
screams at each other
nobodys civil anymore
nobody thinks what its
like to be the other guy
you think men like
thomas wayne ever think
what its like to be
someone like me
to be somebody but themselves
they dont
they think that
well just sit there
and take it
like good little boys
that we wont werewolf
and go wild
you finished
i mean its so much
selfpity arthur
you sound like
youre making excuses
for killing
those young men
not everybody
and ill tell you this
not everyone is awful
youre awful murray
me im awful
oh yeah
how am i awful
playing my video
inviting me
on this show
you just wanted to
make fun of me
youre just like
the rest of them
you dont know the first
thing about me pal

because of what you did what it led to
there are riots
out there
two policemen are
in critical condition
and youre laughing
youre laughing
someone was killed today
because of what you did
i know
how about another joke murray
no i think weve had
enough of your jokes

when you cross
a mentallyill loner
with a society
that abandons him
and treats him
like trash

handcuffed out of the studio
merely just a punch
line to a joke

you deserve
looting and rioting
have intensified here
rioting
throughout the city
with a society
that abandons him
and treats him
like trash
this mob of clowns

those who have been
ignored by the system
