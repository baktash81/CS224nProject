theres bagley
mr bagley something haywire
we havent loaded enough pipe
less than 2000 feet
thatll be enough
on huangatan it didnt come
until we were past 26000 feet
this hole proves out within 2000
or its a writeoff
how are you this evening
all right
the barometer is still falling
its a lousy forecast all right
we should stay here
another 48 hours
every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island
i thought only we knew
well sail right away
youll be sorry
all right mr carnahan
ready to let go
stand by fore and aft
ok haul the gangway ashore
let it go
roy
fred
well heres to the big one
main title
mayday mayday
mayday
im reminded of amsterdam
ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream
captain here
i picked up a mayday call
it faded before i could get a fix
keep listening
let me know if you get anything
like you said
the hell with the weather
we can get out of this
by backtracking around timor
itll only cost us a few days
keep on course im fine
i gotta admit for a new york
desk guy you got a lot of guts
i sold this one to the board
if that island doesnt produce huge
ill be wiping windshields
men
carnahan
id have told you earlier
but i couldnt risk any talk
men we may be sailing into
the history books hit the lights
i believe were headed for
the biggest oil strike ever
here in the magic circle
its magic all right
are we supposed to find oil
under 2000 fathoms of sea
just sea is what the charts say
now lets take a look a low angle
this was taken in 1943
this wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph
no sign of land heres a fog bank
you wouldnt look at twice
lets look at another picture
this is taken from precisely
the same angle
same area same fog bank
this was taken two weeks ago
35 years later
a bank of fog that doesnt change
a wisp in 35 years fantastic
still nothing to explore
except for one reason
a spy satellite photographed it
by mistake
i got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone
no names but he lives
on pennsylvania ave
ok fellas
roy bagley would you take over
and let science make the point
the satellite was to analyse
exhaust gases from a missile test
so it was loaded with
two special kinds of film
no first the infrared
the different colors represent
different surface temperatures
you mean theres land there
correct joe
an island
hidden by a perpetual fog bank
never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot
the infrared patterns arent like
any ive ever seen
more surprising though is
what the spectrograph picked up
chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank
free hydrocarbon radicals
excess nitrogen carbon dioxide
and not poisonous
but very damn curious
this has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground
vapors from petroleum deposits
yes
that island is the tip of a huge
underground tankjust waiting for us
im betting everything ive got
ill take 50 cents of that
the excess co2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration
turn the lights on
animal breathing
are you crazy
and im not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before
in 1605 fernando de queres
was blown south from tenotang
he wrote of the piercing the
white veil thats the cloud bank
and landing on the beach of the skull
where he heard the roar
of the greatest beast
the rest of that log entry
was suppressed by rome
in 1749 a waterlogged lifeboat
was found in the same area
it was empty
but drawn in blood on the port
was a likeness of a huge
slouchy humanoid thing
and this strange warning
from thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven lady
god preserve thee
i also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying japanese in 1944
what the hell are you talking about
who is this joker
beats me
hes wearing a crew jersey
ill pay any fair amount
for my passage
youre a stowaway
jack prescott from princeton
dept of primate paleonthology
you lying hippie
youre from another oil company
the meetings over
hes got one of our tshirts
this doesnt mean a thing gulf
or exxon can fix a fake passport
who the hell are you
i am jack prescott
my interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil
youre not even a good liar you
couldnt find out where were going
you bought charts
come on whod you pay off
they hadnt sold charts for this area
in years a friend tipped me
i did pick up
some charts in surabaya
take this spy below till hes hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit
lets go come on
theres something out there
oh come on
honest to god look
quit horsing around
come back here
theres something out there
about 2 oclock use your glasses
son of a bitch its a raft
all stop
shes alive
gently
ive had firstaid training captain
will you all clear out of here
you have to undress her huh
its usual
in case of internal injury
or shock syndrome
get outta here
clear out
eye magnate beverly hills
theres no sign of
injuries anywhere
c ynara sounds like a yacht
careless yachtsman to lose this
remember that mayday call
you can stop sweating navy
records clean it all checks out
fingerprints
the guys kosher
i know just how to use him too
the girls about to come to she
could be hysterical so follow me
can i get a cheeseburger here
you went to medical school right
what have you got crystal balls
theres nothing i havent checked
i know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training
now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board
youre pretty good with a camera
ive snapped a few monkeys
congratulations
youre now our official photographer
hello everythings fine
youre safe and well
on an american merchant vessel
wheres harry and everyone
you mean theyre gone
do you remember anything
no no
yeah
i was on deck and then
then i was swimming to a star
to a light
let her call it a star
the liferaft was blown over board
near you it had an automatic flare
im fred wilson im in charge
the yacht didnt get very far
after the sos
the radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull
were sorry maam
so am i
harry had discovered me
he was going to put me in a movie
he was making in hong kong
dumb luck
but i guess i really cant complain
when youre alone adrift
in the pacific and somebody just
who spotted me by the way
that young fellow
how can i ever thank you
im dwan
d wan thats my name
like dawn
except that i switched two letters
to make it more memorable
im a mere jack
you must be kidding
how could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me
you need some rest
i havent had a good one of those
in years
are we headed back to singapore
not directly maam
i guess it doesnt matter
im in no rush
harry probably wouldnt have
put me in that movie anyhow
oh my god
what a meaningful miracle
i owe my life to a movie
is that so
i swear to god
harry was showing
this film that i refused to watch
thats why i was up on deck
when the yacht exploded
did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by deep throat
come on men let her rest
maybe my luck has changed
you know something
i always wondered how cortes felt
when he first saw the inca treasure
it was pizarro
and he died busted
here we go
solid land all right
this is its profile east to west
typical pacific formation
this would be the slope at the beach
the mountainous sector at the west
lets get in closer
what was that
just a glitch
false echo off a flock of birds
spot anything unusual
not a thing
look at the screen fred
all those going ashore
report to the companionway
hi there
how do you like this for beach wear
fantastic im afraid
you cant come ashore though
wait a minute
you said i could come
on the first boat
you should wait
till the recon is gone
you want full coverage
of this landing dont you
i must be in it the allamerican
girl saved from a yacht
by deep throat
dont print those im married
guaranteed to be on people magazine
printjust one
really mr wilson
i need a break
and you owe it to me
because i am a holder of
a petrox credit card i really am
ask your computer
i may be late on my payments but
you take 18  interest plus charges
dwan you come ashore with us
captain shell come ashore
good luck as soon as you get
through get on the horn
hey jack maybe its him
fred wilson
i had my horoscope done
before i flew to hong kong
it said that i was
here you go
it said that i was going to cross
over water
and meet the biggest person
in my life
thats interesting the current is
18 degrees cooler than the air
what does that mean
the fog might lift at the edge
crossing 20 fathoms
shallowing rapidly
standing up ahead
i think i hear breakers
shore boat to explorer
theres a curtain around the island
we just broke through
theres a beach dead ahead
in two words no problem
let me get down i havent
touched the ground in weeks
thats good
jack im coming ashore
wait hold it all right
beautiful
lets start getting a line on this
island bring the mosquito spray
we wont have to start wondering
which way to go
you want to start setting
seismic charges this morning
yes got to knock the stucture
all right move out
theres a waterfall ahead
last one to get in
is a rotten egg
dont go running off anymore
well wait here for them
just stick close by me ok
holy mother
that looks as old as the pyramids
could be but the pyramids
werent repaired six months ago
theres earth on those timbers it has
to be replaced after each monsoon
are you telling me
theres people here
whats more ill characterize them
scared people
scared of what
i dont exactly what it is
but apparently they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out
let me straighten you out
on a couple of points
one this wall is an ancient ruin
two the island is uninhabited
and three theres an uninhabited
german beer hall in there
lets go
fred look down there
take your binoculars
what
down there that pool
do you think it could be
the surface seems viscous
it sure as hell could be oil
sweet jesus rockefeller
maybe its a wedding
a good guess
its scheduled for the night
when the moons full
wheres the groom
see the one
in the ape mask
you might say
thats the grooms standin
the groom is
on the other side of the wall
you mean its bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding
ghastly luck
for the whole congregation
oh christ
you want to talk for us
ill try
shoot in the air only
whats he bitching about
hes probably telling us weve
contaminated their magic
no
remember in the air
what is it
he wants to make a deal
six of them for dwan
tell them that i like him too
but not that way
in the air
youll have trouble with the chief
i will buy the chief
what have we got
that wogs go for
radios pots and pans
all sorts ofjunk
this is no longer the 19th century
you cantjust grab their island
ill check that with the un
in the meantime
we scare them into the boondocks
with a july 4th number
are your men ready
to set the charges
kong kong
you heard him chant
he exists you saw the wall
who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to
its some nutty religion
a priest dresses up and gets laid
well humor jack
take plenty of tnt
any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet send it bangbang
you wouldnt
bet me
even you wouldnt be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species
the kids would burn every
petrox gas station in the country
he could be right
kong kong kong
what are you doing
im going to steal a boat
seriously
as soon as ive swiped supplies
im going on a camera hunt
that sounds dangerous
its a chance of a lifetime you
either grab it or youre dead meat
you shouldnt go ashore tonight
its not a good night for aries
how did you know i was an aries
by the shape of your ears
all right i asked fred wilson
he knows everything about you
i really wish you wouldnt go
is it better to watch an old movie
theres nothing else to do
use your imagination
80 times around the deck
is a mile we could jog
i guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours
excuse me ill just finish stealing
in the galley
youll disappoint me if youre here
when i get back
what do you mean
i hope youll wait in your cabin
here you are son
get it out right away
all right
i said that pool might be oil
we cant be sure
think positive guys who think
negative dont get far at petrox
has to be the biggest ever
no problems at all
well youre the boss
dont worry about it roy
help
help me
no
were too late
set off the show
help him with that bolt
cover the gate
get on the other side
pull
open that gate
the lights will hold him back
dont shoot
hes taken her
no ones taken her
who do you think went through
there some guy in an ape suit
you all right
i just fell in a goddamn hole
no you didnt
youre not in a hole
thats a footprint
carnahan here weve gone over two
miles theres still no sign of her
its better than finding remains
unless hes gobbled her down
give me that thing
mostjungle apes eat only fruit
mostjungle apes dont have
a size90 foot
the men have had it
im going to pitch camp
are you a bunch of old ladies
come on
keep moving
carnahans right
it makes more sense to stop
all right carnahan
you know the drill
well plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets
right right
will somebody be on the radar
any large furry blimp seen moving
in your direction youll know
that footprint measured 64 feet
if that were for real
how high would that make him
multiplied by about eight i guess
hed make a hell of a commercial
the battles we at petrox fight
to fill your tank
if hes not going to eat her
why did he take her
apes are very territorial
hell probably take her to his turf
what for
joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her
is that some kind ofjoke or
i dont know carnahan
im as ignorant as you quit asking
me so many dumb questions
i cant stand heights
honest i cant when i was ten i got
sick in the empire state building
put me down
you put me down
you put me down
put me down
please put me down
you goddamn chauvinist pig ape
what are you waiting for
you wanna eat me
then go ahaed do it
go ahead and eat me
go ahead choke on me
i didnt mean that
sometimes i get too physical
its a sign of insecurity
like when you knock down trees
such a nice ape
such a nice sweet monkey
were going to be great friends
im a libra what sign are you
no dont tell me
ill bet youre an aries
of course you are
i think thats just wonderful
help me
help me
radar had him on the screen
36 kilometres west of your flare
he moved in a random manner
not in our direction
affirmative random like a circle
maybe hes lost her she got away
and hes searching for her
carnahan wait a minute
have you set seismic charges
the men are doing it now
dont move until its finished
hes nuts
the girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turnedon ape
i know how you feel
but theres an energy crisis
we must all rise above
our selfinterests
you hypocritical bastard
save your wind hes signed off
lets get going
i aint busting my ass for no whites
ok who gives a shit that
the apes headed in our direction
theres roy
well fred
i finished testing the samples
from that pool
itll be real great oil
son of a bitch
fred wilson is crazy is he
wait till those candyasses
in new york hear about this
ill grind them
like i said it will be great oil
as soon as mother nature
finishes cooking it a little longer
how much longer
hardly a tick of clock in geological
terms say 10000 years
till then youd get better mileage
filling your cadillac with mule piss
oh my god
i hate to kick a fella when hes dead
but i told you
you shouldnt have told new york
you were bringing in the big one
the big one jesus
who says i aint gonna
wilson to explorer

air drop done right on target
perfect haul your asses
get that equipment working

of kong giving away the bride
itd be tough to get him to do it
probably just oldfashioned huh
i dont know
what do you think jack
christ
after all these years
ill finally end up with a shrink
how can i become a star
because of someone
that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank
its not someone its an animal
that tried to rape you
thats not true
he risked his life to save me
he tried to rape you honey
ask the natives what they thought
of losing kong
theyll miss him a lot
like leprosy
youre dead wrong he was the
terror the mystery of their lives
a year from now the island
will be full of burnedout drunks
when we took kong
we kidnapped their god
its like theres a curse
on all of us
im tired of your trying to confuse
this girl
this is her big chance and yours
theres stars at princeton
just like in hollywood you want
me to get kong another keeper
coasttocoast tours
beauty and the beast its a farce
just say the word and your contract

forbidden island and was seized
