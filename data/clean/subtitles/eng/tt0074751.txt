  there s bagley 
mr  bagley  something haywire 
we haven t loaded enough pipe 
  less than 2 000 feet 
  that ll be enough 
on huangatan  it didn t come
until we were past 26 000 feet 
this hole proves out within 2 000 
or it s a write off 
how are you this evening 
all right 
the barometer is still falling 
it s a lousy forecast all right 
we should stay here
another 48 hours 
every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island 
  i thought only we knew   
  we ll sail right away 
you ll be sorry 
all right  mr  carnahan 
ready to let go 
  stand by fore and aft 
  ok  haul the gangway ashore 
let it go 
  roy 
  fred 
well  here s to the big one 
main title
mayday  mayday 
mayday 
i m reminded of amsterdam 
ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream 
  captain here 
  i picked up a mayday call 
  it faded before i could get a fix 
  keep listening 
let me know if you get anything 
like you said 
 the hell with the weather   
we can get out of this
by backtracking around timor 
  it ll only cost us a few days 
  keep on course  i m fine 
i gotta admit  for a new york
desk guy  you got a lot of guts 
i sold this one to the board 
if that island doesn t produce huge 
i ll be wiping windshields 
men 
carnahan 
i d have told you earlier 
but i couldn t risk any talk 
men  we may be sailing into
the history books  hit the lights 
i believe we re headed for
the biggest oil strike ever 
  here in the magic circle 
  it s magic all right 
are we supposed to find oil
under 2 000 fathoms of sea 
just sea is what the charts say 
now let s take a look a low angle 
this was taken in 1943 
this wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph 
no sign of land  here s a fog bank
you wouldn t look at twice 
let s look at another picture 
this is taken from precisely
the same angle 
same area  same fog bank 
this was taken two weeks ago 
35 years later 
a bank of fog that doesn t change
a wisp in 35 years  fantastic 
still nothing to explore 
except for one reason 
a spy satellite photographed it
by mistake 
i got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone 
no names  but he lives
on pennsylvania ave 
ok  fellas 
roy bagley  would you take over
and let science make the point 
the satellite was to analyse
exhaust gases from a missile test 
so it was loaded with
two special kinds of film 
no  first the infrared 
the different colors represent
different surface temperatures 
  you mean there s land there 
  correct  joe 
an island 
hidden by a perpetual fog bank 
never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot 
the infrared patterns aren t like
any i ve ever seen 
more surprising  though  is
what the spectrograph picked up 
chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank 
free hydrocarbon radicals 
excess nitrogen  carbon dioxide 
and  not poisonous
but very damn curious   
this has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground 
  vapors from petroleum deposits 
  yes 
that island is the tip of a huge
underground tankjust waiting for us 
  i m betting everything i ve got 
  i ll take 50 cents of that 
the excess co2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration 
  turn the lights on 
  animal breathing 
are you crazy 
and i m not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before 
in 1605  fernando de queres
was blown south from tenotang 
he wrote of the piercing the
white veil  that s the cloud bank 
and landing on the beach of the skull 
where he heard the roar  
  of the greatest beast   
the rest of that log entry
was suppressed by rome 
in 1749  a water logged lifeboat
was found in the same area 
it was empty 
but drawn in blood on the port  
  was a likeness of a huge 
slouchy humanoid thing 
and this strange warning 
 from thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven  lady   
  god preserve thee   
i also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying japanese in 1944   
what the hell are you talking about 
who is this joker 
  beats me 
  he s wearing a crew jersey 
i ll pay any fair amount
for my    passage 
  you re a stowaway 
  jack prescott  from princeton 
  dept  of primate paleonthology 
  you lying hippie 
you re from another oil company 
the meeting s over 
he s got one of our t shirts 
this doesn t mean a thing  gulf
or exxon can fix a fake passport 
  who the hell are you 
  i am jack prescott   
my interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil 
you re not even a good liar  you
couldn t find out where we re going 
  you bought charts 
  come on  who d you pay off 
they hadn t sold charts for this area
in years  a friend tipped me 
i did pick up
some charts in surabaya 
take this spy below till he s hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit 
let s go  come on 
  there s something out there 
  oh  come on 
  honest to god  look 
  quit horsing around 
come back here 
there s something out there 
about 2 o clock  use your glasses 
son of a bitch  it s a raft 
all stop 
she s alive 
gently 
i ve had first aid training  captain 
will you all clear out of here 
  you have to undress her  huh 
  it s usual 
in case of internal injury
or shock syndrome 
  get outta here 
  clear out 
eye magnate  beverly hills 
there s no sign of
injuries anywhere 
c  y n a r a  sounds like a yacht 
  careless yachtsman  to lose this 
  remember that mayday call 
you can stop sweating  navy
record s clean  it all checks out 
fingerprints 
the guy s kosher 
i know just how to use him  too 
the girl s about to come to  she
could be hysterical  so follow me 
  can i get a cheeseburger here 
  you went to medical school  right 
what have you got  crystal balls 
there s nothing i haven t checked 
i know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training 
now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board 
  you re pretty good with a camera 
  i ve snapped a few monkeys 
congratulations 
you re now our official photographer 
hello  everything s fine 
you re safe and well
on an american merchant vessel 
where s harry and everyone 
  you mean they re gone 
  do you remember anything 
no  no 
yeah   
i was on deck and then   
  then i was swimming to a star 
  to a light 
let her call it a star 
the life raft was blown over board
near you  it had an automatic flare 
i m fred wilson  i m in charge 
the yacht didn t get very far
after the sos 
the radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull 
we re sorry  ma am 
so am i 
harry had discovered me 
he was going to put me in a movie
he was making in hong kong 
dumb luck 
but i guess i really can t complain 
when you re alone adrift
in the pacific and somebody just   
  who spotted me  by the way 
  that young fellow 
how can i ever thank you 
i m dwan 
d  w a n  that s my name 
like dawn   
  except that i switched two letters
to make it more memorable 
  i m a mere jack 
  you must be kidding 
how could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me 
you need some rest 
i haven t had a good one of those
in years 
  are we headed back to singapore 
  not directly  ma am 
i guess it doesn t matter 
i m in no rush 
harry probably wouldn t have
put me in that movie anyhow 
oh  my god 
what a meaningful miracle 
  i owe my life to a movie 
  is that so 
i swear to god 
harry was showing
this film that i refused to watch 
that s why i was up on deck
when the yacht exploded 
did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by  deep throat  
come on  men  let her rest 
maybe my luck has changed 
you know something 
i always wondered how cortes felt
when he first saw the inca treasure 
it was pizarro 
and he died busted 
here we go   
solid land all right 
this is its profile east to west 
typical pacific formation   
this would be the slope at the beach 
the mountainous sector at the west 
let s get in closer 
  what was that 
  just a glitch 
  false echo off a flock of birds 
  spot anything unusual 
  not a thing 
  look at the screen  fred 
all those going ashore 
report to the companionway 
hi there 
how do you like this for beach wear 
fantastic  i m afraid
you can t come ashore  though 
wait a minute 
you said i could come
on the first boat 
you should wait
till the recon is gone 
you want full coverage
of this landing  don t you 
i must be in it  the all american
girl saved from a yacht  
  by  deep throat  
  don t print those  i m married 
  guaranteed to be on people magazine 
  printjust one 
  really  mr  wilson   
i need a break 
and you owe it to me 
because i am a holder of
a petrox credit card  i really am 
ask your computer 
i may be late on my payments  but
you take 18     interest plus charges 
dwan  you come ashore with us 
captain  she ll come ashore 
good luck  as soon as you get
through  get on the horn 
hey  jack  maybe it s him 
fred wilson 
i had my horoscope done
before i flew to hong kong 
  it said that i was   
  here you go 
it said that i was going to cross
over water  
  and meet the biggest person
in my life 
that s interesting  the current is
18 degrees cooler than the air 
  what does that mean 
  the fog might lift at the edge 
crossing 20 fathoms 
shallowing rapidly 
standing up ahead 
i think i hear breakers 
shore boat to explorer 
there s a curtain around the island 
we just broke through 
there s a beach dead ahead 
in two words  no problem 
let me get down  i haven t
touched the ground in weeks 
that s good 
jack  i m coming ashore 
wait  hold it  all right 
beautiful 
let s start getting a line on this
island  bring the mosquito spray 
we won t have to start wondering
which way to go 
you want to start setting
seismic charges this morning 
  yes  got to knock the stucture 
  all right  move out 
there s a waterfall ahead 
last one to get in
is a rotten egg 
don t go running off anymore 
we ll wait here for them 
just stick close by me  ok 
holy mother 
that looks as old as the pyramids 
could be  but the pyramids
weren t repaired six months ago 
there s earth on those timbers  it has
to be replaced after each monsoon 
are you telling me
there s people here 
what s more  i ll characterize them 
scared people 
  scared of what 
  i don t exactly what it is 
but apparently  they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out 
let me straighten you out
on a couple of points 
one  this wall is an ancient ruin 
two  the island is uninhabited 
and three  there s an uninhabited
german beer hall in there 
let s go 
fred  look down there 
take your binoculars 
  what 
  down there  that pool 
  do you think it could be 
  the surface seems viscous 
it sure as hell could be oil 
sweet jesus  rockefeller 
  maybe it s a wedding 
  a good guess 
it s scheduled for the night
when the moon s full 
where s the groom 
see the one
in the ape mask 
you might say
that s the groom s stand in 
the groom is
on the other side of the wall 
you mean it s bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding 
ghastly luck
for the whole congregation 
oh  christ 
you want to talk for us 
i ll try 
shoot in the air only 
what s he bitching about 
he s probably telling us we ve
contaminated their magic 
no 
remember  in the air 
what is it 
he wants to make a deal 
six of them for dwan 
tell them that i like him  too 
but not that way 
in the air 
  you ll have trouble with the chief 
  i will buy the chief 
what have we got
that wogs go for 
radios  pots and pans 
all sorts ofjunk 
this is no longer the 19th century 
you can tjust grab their island 
i ll check that with the un 
in the meantime  
  we scare them into the boondocks
with a july 4th number 
are your men ready
to set the charges 
kong  kong 
you heard him chant 
he exists  you saw the wall 
who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to 
it s some nutty religion 
a priest dresses up and gets laid 
we ll humor jack 
take plenty of tnt 
any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet  send it bang bang 
  you wouldn t 
  bet me 
even you wouldn t be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species 
the kids would burn every
petrox gas station in the country 
  he could be right 
  kong  kong  kong   
  what are you doing 
  i m going to steal a boat 
  seriously 
  as soon as i ve swiped supplies 
  i m going on a camera hunt 
  that sounds dangerous 
it s a chance of a lifetime  you
either grab it or you re dead meat 
you shouldn t go ashore tonight 
it s not a good night for aries 
how did you know i was an aries 
by the shape of your ears 
all right  i asked fred wilson 
he knows everything about you 
  i really wish you wouldn t go 
  is it better to watch an old movie 
there s nothing else to do 
use your imagination 
80 times around the deck
is a mile  we could jog 
i guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours 
excuse me  i ll just finish stealing
in the galley 
you ll disappoint me if you re here
when i get back 
  what do you mean 
  i hope you ll wait in your cabin 
here you are  son 
get it out right away 
all right 
i said that pool might be oil 
we can t be sure   
think positive  guys who think
negative don t get far at petrox 
 has to be the biggest ever 
no problems at all   
  well  you re the boss 
  don t worry about it  roy 
help 
help me 
no 
we re too late 
set off the show 
  help him with that bolt 
  cover the gate 
get on the other side 
pull 
open that gate 
the lights will hold him back 
don t shoot 
  he s taken her 
  no one s taken her 
who do you think went through
there  some guy in an ape suit 
  you all right 
  i just fell in a goddamn hole 
no  you didn t 
you re not in a hole 
that s a footprint 
carnahan here  we ve gone over two
miles  there s still no sign of her 
  it s better than finding remains 
  unless he s gobbled her down 
give me that thing 
mostjungle apes eat only fruit 
mostjungle apes don t have
a size 90 foot 
the men have had it 
i m going to pitch camp 
are you a bunch of old ladies 
come on 
keep moving 
carnahan s right 
it makes more sense to stop 
all right  carnahan 
you know the drill 
we ll plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets   
  right  right 
  will somebody be on the radar 
any large  furry blimp seen moving
in your direction  you ll know 
that footprint measured 6 4 feet 
if that were for real 
how high would that make him 
multiplied by about eight  i guess 
he d make a hell of a commercial 
 the battles we at petrox fight
to fill your tank   
if he s not going to eat her 
why did he take her 
apes are very territorial 
he ll probably take her to his turf 
what for 
joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her 
  is that some kind ofjoke or   
  i don t know  carnahan 
i m as ignorant as you  quit asking
me so many dumb questions 
i can t stand heights 
honest i can t  when i was ten i got
sick in the empire state building 
put me down 
you put me down 
you put me down 
put me down 
please put me down 
you goddamn chauvinist pig ape 
what are you waiting for 
you wanna eat me 
then go ahaed  do it 
go ahead and eat me 
go ahead  choke on me 
i didn t mean that 
sometimes i get too physical 
it s a sign of insecurity 
like when you knock down trees 
such a nice ape 
such a nice  sweet monkey 
we re going to be great friends 
i m a libra  what sign are you 
no  don t tell me 
i ll bet you re an aries 
of course you are 
i think that s just wonderful 
help me 
help me 
radar had him on the screen 
3 6 kilometres west of your flare 
he moved in a random manner 
  not in our direction 
  affirmative  random  like a circle 
maybe he s lost her  she got away
and he s searching for her 
carnahan  wait a minute 
  have you set seismic charges 
  the men are doing it now 
  don t move until it s finished 
  he s nuts 
the girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turned on ape 
i know how you feel 
but there s an energy crisis 
we must all rise above
our self interests 
  you hypocritical bastard   
  save your wind  he s signed off 
let s get going 
i ain t busting my ass for no whites 
ok  who gives a shit that
the ape s headed in our direction 
  there s roy 
  well  fred   
i finished testing the samples
from that pool 
  it ll be real great oil 
  son of a bitch 
fred wilson is crazy  is he 
wait till those candy asses
in new york hear about this 
  i ll grind them   
  like i said  it will be great oil 
as soon as mother nature
finishes cooking it a little longer 
how much longer 
hardly a tick of clock  in geological
terms  say 10 000 years 
till then you d get better mileage
filling your cadillac with mule piss 
oh  my god 
i hate to kick a fella when he s dead 
but i told you 
you shouldn t have told new york
you were bringing in the big one 
the big one  jesus 
who says i ain t gonna 
wilson to explorer 
get me a channel to surabaya 
i want an engineer drop 
ok  jack  you go first 
  come on  it s solid as a rock

i m going on 
all hands  stand by for recovery 
  over and out 
  recharge the batteries 
  air drop done  right on target 
  perfect  haul your asses 
get that equipment working 
  you think i m crazy 
  you said it 
if i had found oil  gulf  shell  exxon

i want balanchine to choreograph
 the beauty and the beast  
any chance of you two
getting married 
i don t know 
this is so sudden 
we could think of some nutty way
of kong giving away the bride 
it d be tough to get him to do it 
probably just old fashioned  huh 
i don t know 
what do you think  jack 
christ 
after all these years 
i ll finally end up with a shrink 
how can i become a star
because of someone  
  that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank 
it s not someone  it s an animal
that tried to rape you 
that s not true 
he risked his life to save me 
he tried to rape you  honey 
ask the natives what they thought
of losing kong 
  they ll miss him a lot 
  like leprosy 
you re dead wrong  he was the
terror  the mystery of their lives 
a year from now  the island
will be full of burned out drunks 
when we took kong 
we kidnapped their god 
it s like there s a curse
on all of us 
i m tired of your trying to confuse
this girl 
this is her big chance  and yours 
there s stars at princeton  
  just like in hollywood  you want
me to get kong another keeper 
coast to coast tours 
 beauty and the beast   it s a farce 
just say the word and your contract
is torn up  tell me right now

forbidden island and was seized

kong s power 
superpower

that s the power of kong 
and petrox
