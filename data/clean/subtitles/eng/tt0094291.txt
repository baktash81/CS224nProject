kamali leopardskin vcut bikini
which is gonna turn back the clock on my
marriage five years know what i mean
call for you sir sir lawrence wildman

thank you nyung
would you fix mr livingston another
martini stick around this could be fun
its all because this ukrainian bitch
botched the job on my wax on my bikini line
how ghastly sue her
larry what a surprise
i want to see you gordon
can it wait till tomorrow i got people here
no this cant wait its important
ok if you feel that way come on over
ah there you are
can i steal him for a minute
of course
i want your opinion
so what do you see in this
purity innocence
a few thousand dollars
down the tubes if you ask me
really
you can kiss your career
as an art appraiser goodbye
we paid over 400000 for it at the
contemporary picture sale last june
jesus you couldve had
a whole beach house for that
sure you could in wildwood new jersey
if you sold this one you could
have a nice penthouse on fifth
you wouldnt have much
left over for decoration
its nice if youre on mushrooms
i thought gordon was a tough businessman
he sure has taken a bath on that
a bath id say gordon is one of
the most astute collectors around
he has a great eye and he only buys the best
like this rug for instance
a bokhara its the finest of its kind
after he bought it a dealer
representing the saudi royal family
offered him twice what he paid
it absolutely makes the room
see how this bit of celadon in the border
is picked up by these cushions
although its a sacrilege
having that etruscan vase on the table
some dope might use it as an ashtray
i guess youre a decorator
you got it
a great spender of other peoples money
if youre that good im sure you
can do wonders with my place
where would that be
upper west side
really home of the exposed
brick wall and the houseplant
its just a rental ill be moving to the east
side soon some deals brewing with gordon
but thats just conversation
what about real things
like dinner the two of us next friday
cafe santo domingo
what if i have a previous engagement
you break it
there you go again darien
talking with strange men

yeah frank work 500000 shares teldar
with a limit of 26 new account
dont fuck it up
hows teldar doing
back again
ive got a real appetite
bring it five to a half 2000 up
i gotta buy stock whats offered at a half
what are we looking at
make me an offer on 80
80000 at a half
ill take it
your company ladies and gentlemen
is under siege from gordon gekko
teldar paper is now leveraged to the hilt
like some pisspoor south american country
i strongly recommend you to see through
mr gekkos shameless intention here
to strip this company
and severely penalize the stockholders
i strongly recommend you
to reject his tender
by voting for managements
restructuring of the stock
well i appreciate the opportunity
youre giving me mr cromwell
as the single largest shareholder
in teldar paper to speak
we are not here to indulge in fantasy
but in political and economic reality
america america
has become a secondrate power
its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit
are at nightmare proportions
in the days of the free market when
our country was a top industrial power
there was accountability to the stockholder
the carnegies the mellons the men
that built this great empire made sure of it
because it was their money at stake
today management
has no stake in the company
all together these men sitting up here
own less than 3 of the company
and where does mr cromwell
put his 1000000 salary
not in teldar stock he owns less than 1
you own the company
thats right you the stockholder
and you are all being royally
screwed over by these bureaucrats
with their steak lunches their fishing trips
their corporate jets and golden parachutes
this is an outrage youre out of line gekko
teldar paper mr cromwell
has 33 different vice presidents
each earning over 200000 a year
now i have spent the last two months
analyzing what all these guys do
and i still cant figure it out
one thing i do know is that
our paper company lost 110m last year
and ill bet half of that was spent in all the
paperwork between all these vice presidents
the new law of evolution
in corporate america
seems to be survival of the unfit test
well in my book you either do it right
or you get eliminated
in the last seven deals that i have been
involved with there were 25m stockholders
who have made a pretax profit of 12 billion
thank you
i am not a destroyer of companies
i am a liberator of them
the point is ladies and gentlemen
that greed for lack of a better word
is good
greed is right greed works
greed clarifies cuts through and captures
the essence of the evolutionary spirit
greed in all of its forms  greed for life
for money for love knowledge
has marked the upward surge of mankind
and greed you mark my words
will not only save teldar paper
but that other malfunctioning
corporation called the usa
thank you very much
fly me to the moon
let me play among the stars
buy me 20 june eurodollar cds
20 march gold and sell 10 september
deutsch marks right talk at ya babe
ah buddy buddy i hate to tell you this
but you are a genius
darien lightning has struck
the light bulb has been invented
bluestar airlines
edison da vinci einstein
theyre all watching me
ever hear of the 60hour work week
youve gotta go to work soon im getting
psychotic from a lack of rem sleep
im not gonna broker the rest of my life
i am gonna be a giant an entrepreneur
in the italian 16thcentury sense of the word
a mover a shaker
im shooting for the stars darien
youre coming along for the ride
bluestar is an unpolished gem gordon
a halfassed management being decimated
by a price war they cannot win
but the gates at laguardia alone
can bail us out
if its worth a dime its worth 10 bucks
a share theyre ripe to fall
mixed emotions buddy
like larry wildman going off
a cliff in my new maserati
guys like me have had their asses hung
in a sling with the airlines
fuel could go up unions are killers
yeah but arent you forgetting one thing
capital reserves this company has
75 million cash in an overfunded pension
that buys us a lot of credibility
and the beauty is you already
own close to 2 of this sucker
the insurance people are balking on the
logging trucks what do you want to do
tell those assholes
well selfinsure if they dont write it
i cant believe we can fire half
the management and nothing changes
gordon what i want
and ive never asked you for anything
is to be your copilot on this one
i wanna take this airline turn it around and
make it work its gonna make us a fortune
i got a stockbroker who wants an airline itll
take two years to turn teldar paper around
what do i need a dink airline for im up
to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake
ive worked at bluestar i know my way
around i have friends there inside
what do you mean
the three unions
its 43 of biuestars operating budget
the hourly cost of a flight crew is 850
an hour thats the real hidden value gg
if you can negotiate that out
get a crew down to 350 400 an hour
this airlinell be the hottest thing
since texas air
what makes you think you can
i can talk to these people they trust me
my father can be a big help in getting cuts
all right susan get buckingham
on the phone tell him to look into it
so the falcons heard the falconer huh
hi dad
sorry im late
thats ok overdressed as usual
come on in everybodys here
i couldnt start the show without you
well ill be a lousy republican
i decorate for democrats too
lots of them im darien taylor
buds told me all about you
dont believe a word
i never beat him or locked him in a closet
i forgot about the closet
he turned out ok
buds a born liar otherwise hes a good kid
i hope you come here more often
under less formal circumstances
thank you
dad you know duncan wilmore
sure how are ya
pilots union
toni carpenter flight attendants
id like you to meet mr gekko
mr fox pleasure to meet you
his attorney mr salt
id be proud to have a son like buddy
got a hell of a career in front of him
im glad you think so i thought this was
informal whats your attorney doing here
harold you dont mind walking
around the block do you
of course
ill take that
no offense
none taken
thats ok gordon bud does it all the time
look i got no illusions about winning
a popularity contest with any of you
i got roasted the other night
a friend asked why are we honoring this
man did we run out of human beings
its not always the most popular guy
who gets the job done
youve got losses of 2030 million
dividends cut to zero
and youre being squeezed
to death by the majors
the management may not be the worst scum
but they put you on this kamikaze course
and pretty soon everybody
is gonna be scrambling for parachutes
only theres not enough to go around
management has them you dont
if they throw bluestar to chapter 11
which i think they will
theyll use the bankruptcy laws to break
your unions and throw you off the property
oh come on with all due respect whats
to prevent you from doing the same thing
cos i got a way around all this
where we can all make money
and make the airline profitable
so what do you say we cut to the chase
im asking for a modest 20 acrosstheboard
wage cut and seven more hours a month
what kind of time frame
a year if were still losing money
the reduction stands
if were in the black ill return part of the
givebacks pay goes back to current levels
and we initiate an employee
profitsharing program with stock
youll own part of the airline
will you put it in writing
ill have a letter of agreement
drafted up in two days
whats your marketing strategy
how will you return us to profitability
why dont i give buddy an opportunity
to answer that buddy
thank you gordon
first i want you all to know
that my door will always be open
because i know from my dad
its you guys that keep bluestar flying
what ive come up with here
is a basic threepoint plan
one we modernize our computer
software is dogshit we update it
we squeeze every dollar
out of each mile flown
dont sell a seat to a guy for 79 bucks
when hes willing to pay 379
effective inventory management
will increase our load factor by 520
that translates to approximately
50200 million in revenues
the point being
we can beat the majors at a price war
two advertising more and aggressive
we attack the majors
three expansion we expand our hubs
to atlanta north carolina and st louis
and we reorganize all
of our feeder schedules
we gotta think big guys
were going after the majors
well cards on the table guys
what do you say
well if you mean what you say
i think were probably in the ballpark
i guess i can take it to my people
good
youve sketched broad strokes
id like to see the fine print
but i like what i hear so far
i guess if a man lives long enough he gets
to see everything and i do mean everything
what else you got
in your bag of tricks mr gekko
frankly carl i cant see giving much more
but if you have any suggestions ill listen
there came into egypt
a pharaoh who did not know
i beg your pardon is that a proverb
no a prophecy
the rich have been doing it
to the poor since time began
the only difference is
the egyptians didnt allow unions
i know what this guys all about  greed
he dont care about bluestar or the unions
hes in for the buck he dont take prisoners
wait a minute dad
sure whats worth doing
is worth doing for money
its a bad bargain if nobody gains
and if we do this deal everybody gains
course my son worked as a baggage handler
and freight loader for three summers
with those qualifications
he can run an airline
fine stay with the present management
dedicated to running you and
your airline into the ground
that scum built the company up with one
plane and made something out of nothing
if thats a scum ill take it over a rat any day
you know where i stand good night all
excuse me
congratulations dad you did a great job
embarrassing me not to mention yourself
save the workers unite speech
i heard it too much growing up
oh yeah
youll get axed no two ways about it
you and the whole shitty airline
are going down the tubes
and if it isnt gekko
its gonna be some other killer
hes using you kid hes got your prick
in his pocket but youre too blind to see it
no i see a jealous old machinist
who cant stand the fact that his sons
more successful than he is
what you see is a guy who never measured
a mans success by the size of his wallet
thats because you never had the guts to go
out into the world and stake your own claim
boy if thats the way you feel
i mustve done a really lousy job as a father
as far as being axed im still around
and i have a responsibility
to the union membership i represent
your responsibility is to present the facts
not opinions to your men
youll destroy their lives
let them decide for themselves
my men will want to know whats
going on and i wont lie to them
oh yeah your men your fuckin men
all my life your men have
been able to count on you
why have you never been there for me
what if youre wrong
what if one day the sun didnt rise in the
east and for once your compass was off
would you be willing to wreck
your mens future my future
dad think for a change be practical
im asking you im fuckin begging you
i dont go to sleep with no whore
and i dont wake up with no whore
thats how i live with myself
i dont know how you do it
i hope im wrong about this guy
but ill let the men decide for themselves
that much i promise you
you should look at this chief
a guy at jackson steinem
buying large chunks of teldar paper
for an offshore account
so whats the problema
do you know what the fuck the problem is
what
you dont know
i dont know
i get a strange call from the sec
they asked to see my records
this is heavy bud
hey hey hey relax relax roger
youre 82m in the account numbers
and im the invisible man
well thats good for you bud
theyre always looking for red flags
gekkos always getting checked by em
they never come up with anything rog
hey were invulnerable on this one
i just wanna slow down bud
all right
no more lunches no calls all right
we suspend our business all right
whatever you want rog its cooi
excuse me hey rog can you come
back in bring the cost report
were starting again
gekkos asked us into the bluestar deal
were reviewing timetables
you wanna come
he didnt tell me about that
youre only the president of the company
what the hell do you know anyway right
guys new chief of bluestar  bud fox
hi
hello bud
guys whats the problem its time to kill
gekkos got 12 of the stock and climbing
plus hes got the unions in his back pocket
everybody knows the stocks in play
by next week the street will own bluestar
is the bank financing in place
or are we gonna sit around and have
more of these ridiculous meetings
our firm committed weeks ago 25
of the total longterm debt structure
unless you guys sign
this piece of paper right now
im gonna pull and go to
another bank for the 75
look weve got 30 banks ready to participate
in a fouryear revolving credit line
we must have your assurance you will pay
back most of the loan in the first 12 months
the only way we can see this happening
is liquidating the hangars and the planes
can you people guarantee
the liquidation of bluestar
guarantee no sweat
we got the bleezburgs lined up
to build condos where the hangars are
we lay the airplanes off to the mexicans
who are dumb enough to buy em
and i got the texas boys drooling
at my kneecaps for the routes and slots
whats your problem its done
heres the price tags
on the 737s gates hangars routes
we got it nailed right down
to the typewriters
the beauty of this deal
is the overfunded pension
gekko makes 75m there
50 million buys him the minimum
annuities for 6000 employees
and he walks away with the rest
i figure hell make hell clear 6070m
not bad for a months work
your boy really did his homework fox
and youll have the shortest executive
career since that pope that got poisoned
now hell really start believing
hes gekko the great
hed like to change that appointment
hold this
bud you cant go in hes in a meeting
alex has come up with
an ingenious way for us to
i didnt know we had a meeting today sport
i didnt either
i think we should talk gordon
would you excuse us for a second
wont you come this way gentlemen
thank you alex
what do you want
i just found out about
the garage sale at bluestar
why
last night i was reading rudy
winniethepooh and the honeypot
you know what happened he stuck his nose
in the pot once too often and he got stuck
maybe you oughta read him pinocchio
i thought you were gonna turn
bluestar around not upside down
you fuckin used me
youre walking around blind without a cane
a fool and his money are lucky to even meet
why do you need to wreck this company
because its wreckable all right
i took another look i changed my mind
if they lose their jobs
they got nowhere to go
my father has worked there for 24 years
i gave him my word
its all about bucks kid
the rest is conversation
buddy youll still be president
when the time comes
youll parachute out a rich man
with the money youll make
your dads never got to work again
so tell me gordon
when does it all end huh
how many yachts can you waterski behind
how much is enough
its not a question of enough pal
its a zerosum game
somebody wins somebody loses
money itself isnt lost or made
its simply transferred
from one perception to another like magic
this painting here
i bought it ten years ago for 60000
i could sell it today for six hundred
the illusion has become real
and the more real it becomes
the more desperate they want it
capitalism at its finest
how much is enough gordon
the richest 1 of this country owns half
our countrys wealth five trillion dollars
one third comes from hard work
two thirds from inheritance
interest on interest accumulating
to widows and idiot sons
and what i do
stock and realestate speculation
its bullshit
you got 90 of the american public
with little or no net worth
i create nothing
i own
we make the rules pal
the news war peace famine upheaval
the price of a paper clip
we pick that rabbit out of the hat while
everybody wonders how the hell we did it
youre not naive enough to think were
living in a democracy are you buddy
its the free market and youre part of it
yeah you got that killer instinct
stick around pal
i still got a lot to teach you
obviously
oh buddy come on
i was gonna tell you about it
calm down all right
well have dinner tonight bring darien
no i cant make it tonight
hey buddy
are you with me
i need to know if youre with me
im with you gordon
natalie ill be right there
yes mr gekko
yeah
yeah ollie
tell them i want ziplocked mouths
on the bluestar deal
or ill come down there
and rip out their fuckin throats
bud
whats going on
ive been played like a grand piano
by the master gekko the great
today was the big crash
the liquidation sale
hes gonna carve bluestar
into little pieces and sell it all off
bastard
im sorry
i was afraid something
like this could happen
i handed it to him on a silver platter
i told my father
bud bud its not your fault
and its not your decision
im not gonna let it happen
dont cross gordon hell crush you

the big wall street story today
was bluestar airlines
fueled by takeover rumors the stock
soared to an alltime high of 24 18
when rumors later surfaced
that the takeover was unfounded
buyers ran for cover and the stock
plummeted to 16 12 before closing at 17
then amidst all the scuttlebutt
another rumble shook the street
raider sir lawrence wildman has stepped in
and bought a substantial block of bluestar
and will announce a deal tomorrow
that includes the support of the unions
we talked with a leading
stock market analyst
in order to understand the ramifications
