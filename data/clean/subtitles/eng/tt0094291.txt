thank you  nyung

how ghastly  sue her 
  larry  what a surprise 
  i want to see you  gordon 
can it wait till tomorrow  i got people here 
  no  this can t wait  it s important 
  ok  if you feel that way  come on over 
ah  there you are 
can i steal him for a minute 
  of course 
  i want your opinion 
so what do you see in this 
purity  innocence 
a few thousand dollars
down the tubes  if you ask me 
really 
you can kiss your career
as an art appraiser goodbye 
we paid over 400 000 for it at the
contemporary picture sale last june 
jesus  you could ve had
a whole beach house for that 
sure you could  in wildwood  new jersey 
if you sold this one  you could
have a nice penthouse on fifth 
you wouldn t have much
left over for decoration 
it s nice  if you re on mushrooms 
i thought gordon was a tough businessman 
he sure has taken a bath on that 
a bath  i d say gordon is one of
the most astute collectors around 
he has a great eye  and he only buys the best 
like this rug  for instance 
a bokhara  it s the finest of its kind 
after he bought it  a dealer
representing the saudi royal family
offered him twice what he paid 
it absolutely makes the room 
see how this bit of celadon in the border
is picked up by these cushions 
although it s a sacrilege
having that etruscan vase on the table 
some dope might use it as an ashtray 
  i guess you re a decorator 
  you got it 
a great spender of other people s money 
if you re that good  i m sure you
can do wonders with my place 
  where would that be 
  upper west side 
really  home of the exposed
brick wall and the houseplant 
it s just a rental  i ll be moving to the east
side soon  some deals brewing with gordon 
but that s just conversation 
what about real things 
like dinner  the two of us    next friday 
cafe santo domingo 
what if i have a previous engagement 
you break it 
there you go again  darien 
talking with strange men 
hello  sam  do you know bud fox

my interest is the same as yours  money

no  this time i m in for the long term  it s
not a liquidation  i m gonna turn it around 
you re getting a free ride on my tail  mate 
with the dollars you re costing me to buy
back stock  i could modernize the plant 
i m not the only one who pays here  gordon 
we re talking about lives and jobs 
four generations of steelworkers   
correct me if i m wrong  but when you got
cnx electronics  you laid off 6 000 workers 
jemson fruit  4 000 
that airline you bought  um   
i could break you  mate 
in two pieces over my knees 
you know it  i know it 
i could buy you six times over 
i could dump the stock just to burn your arse 
but i happen to want the company 
and i want your block of shares 
i m announcing
a tender offer at 65 tomorrow 
i m expecting your commitment 
showdowns bore me  larry  nobody wins 
you can have the company 
in fact  it ll be fun watching you and your
giant ego trying to make a horse race of it 
buddy  what s a fair price for that stock 
the break up value is higher  it s worth 80 
well  we don t want to be greedy 
so what do you say to 72 
you re a two bit pirate and greenmailer 
nothing more 
gekko 
not only would you sell your mother
to make a deal  you d send her cod 
my mail is the same color as yours is  pal

considering you brought my mother into it 
71 50 
done

tomorrow  8am  good night

the key to the game is capital reserves 
if you don t have enough  you can t piss
in the tall weeds with the big dogs 
 all warfare is based on deception   sun tzu

mr gekko has no official knowledge

we are smart enough not to buy
into the oldest myth running   love 
fiction created by people to keep
them from jumping out of windows 
you know  sometimes i miss you  gordon 
you re really twisted 
for chrissake  jack  it s easy 
on settlement day you endorse a check
to blue horseshoe trading company 
then i ll send you your cut 
what  no  that s the bottom line 
nobody gets hurt 
what the fuck is wrong with you 
it s so bad  even the liars are complaining 
but not you  you re making big money 
  what s the bottom line 
  hey  look 
i am sick and tired of playing
wet nurse to you 
  will you do your own homework  marv 
  what an asshole  man 
that s a shame 
yeah  frank  work 500 000 shares teldar
with a limit of 26  new account 
don t fuck it up 
  how s teldar doing 
  back again 
  i ve got a real appetite 
  bring it five to a half  2 000 up 
  i gotta buy stock  what s offered at a half 
  what are we looking at 
  make me an offer on 80 
  80 000 at a half 
i ll take it 
your company  ladies and gentlemen 
is under siege from gordon gekko 
teldar paper is now leveraged to the hilt 
like some piss poor south american country 
i strongly recommend you to see through
mr gekko s shameless intention here
to strip this company 
and severely penalize the stockholders 
i strongly recommend you
to reject his tender
by voting for management s
restructuring of the stock 
well  i appreciate the opportunity
you re giving me  mr cromwell 
as the single largest shareholder
in teldar paper  to speak 
we are not here to indulge in fantasy 
but in political and economic reality 
america    america
has become a second rate power 
its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit
are at nightmare proportions 
in the days of the free market  when
our country was a top industrial power 
there was accountability to the stockholder 
the carnegies  the mellons  the men
that built this great empire  made sure of it
because it was their money at stake 
today  management
has no stake in the company 
all together  these men sitting up here
own less than 3  of the company 
and where does mr cromwell
put his  1 000 000 salary 
not in teldar stock  he owns less than 1  
you own the company 
that s right  you  the stockholder 
and you are all being royally
screwed over by these bureaucrats 
with their steak lunches  their fishing trips 
their corporate jets and golden parachutes 
this is an outrage  you re out of line  gekko 
teldar paper  mr cromwell 
has 33 different vice presidents 
each earning over  200 000 a year 
now  i have spent the last two months
analyzing what all these guys do 
and i still can t figure it out 
one thing i do know is that
our paper company lost  110m last year 
and i ll bet half of that was spent in all the
paperwork between all these vice presidents 
the new law of evolution
in corporate america
seems to be    survival of the unfit test 
well  in my book you either do it right 
or you get eliminated 
in the last seven deals that i have been
involved with there were 2 5m stockholders
who have made a pretax profit of  12 billion 
thank you 
i am not a destroyer of companies 
i am a liberator of them 
the point is  ladies and gentlemen 
that greed  for lack of a better word 
is good 
greed is right  greed works 
greed clarifies  cuts through and captures
the essence of the evolutionary spirit 
greed  in all of its forms   greed for life 
for money  for love  knowledge  
has marked the upward surge of mankind 
and greed  you mark my words 
will not only save teldar paper 
but that other malfunctioning
corporation called the usa 
thank you very much 
  fly me to the moon
  let me play among the stars
buy me 20 june eurodollar cds 
20 march gold and sell 10 september
deutsch marks  right  talk at ya  babe 
ah  buddy  buddy  i hate to tell you this 
but you are a genius 
darien  lightning has struck 
the light bulb has been invented 
bluestar airlines 
edison  da vinci  einstein 
they re all watching me 
ever hear of the 60 hour work week 
you ve gotta go to work soon  i m getting
psychotic from a lack of rem sleep 
i m not gonna broker the rest of my life 
i am gonna be a giant  an entrepreneur
in the italian 16th century sense of the word 
a mover  a shaker 
i m shooting for the stars  darien 
you re coming along for the ride 
bluestar is an unpolished gem  gordon 
a half assed management being decimated
by a price war they cannot win 
but the gates at laguardia alone
can bail us out 
if it s worth a dime  it s worth 10 bucks
a share  they re ripe to fall 
mixed emotions  buddy 
like larry wildman going off
a cliff    in my new maserati 
guys like me have had their asses hung
in a sling with the airlines 
  fuel could go up  unions are killers 
  yeah  but aren t you forgetting one thing 
capital reserves  this company has
75 million cash in an overfunded pension 
that buys us a lot of credibility 
and the beauty is  you already
own close to 2  of this sucker 
the insurance people are balking on the
logging trucks  what do you want to do 
tell those assholes
we ll self insure if they don t write it 
i can t believe we can fire half
the management and nothing changes 
gordon  what i want 
and i ve never asked you for anything 
is to be your copilot on this one 
i wanna take this airline  turn it around and
make it work  it s gonna make us a fortune 
i got a stockbroker who wants an airline  it ll
take two years to turn teldar paper around 
what do i need a dink airline for  i m up
to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake 
i ve worked at bluestar  i know my way
around  i have friends there  inside 
what do you mean 
the three unions 
it s 43  of biuestar s operating budget 
the hourly cost of a flight crew is 850
an hour  that s the real hidden value  gg 
if you can negotiate that out 
get a crew down to 350  400 an hour 
this airline ll be the hottest thing
since texas air 
  what makes you think you can 
  i can talk to these people  they trust me 
my father can be a big help in getting cuts 
all right  susan  get buckingham
on the phone  tell him to look into it 
so the falcon s heard the falconer  huh 
  hi  dad

i never beat him or locked him in a closet

his attorney  mr salt 
i d be proud to have a son like buddy 
got a hell of a career in front of him 
i m glad you think so  i thought this was
informal  what s your attorney doing here 
harold  you don t mind walking
around the block  do you 
  of course 
  i ll take that 
no offense 
none taken 
that s ok  gordon  bud does it all the time 
look  i got no illusions about winning
a popularity contest with any of you 
i got roasted the other night 
a friend asked  why are we honoring this
man  did we run out of human beings  
it s not always the most popular guy
who gets the job done 
you ve got losses of  20 30 million 
dividends cut to zero 
and you re being squeezed
to death by the majors 
the management may not be the worst scum 
but they put you on this kamikaze course 
and pretty soon everybody
is gonna be scrambling for parachutes 
only there s not enough to go around 
management has them  you don t 
if they throw bluestar to chapter 11 
which i think they will 
they ll use the bankruptcy laws to break
your unions  and throw you off the property 
oh  come on  with all due respect  what s
to prevent you from doing the same thing 
cos i got a way around all this 
where we can all make money
and make the airline profitable 
so what do you say we cut to the chase 
i m asking for a modest 20  across the board
wage cut  and seven more hours a month 
what kind of time frame 
a year  if we re still losing money 
the reduction stands 
if we re in the black  i ll return part of the
givebacks  pay goes back to current levels 
and we initiate an employee
profit sharing program with stock 
  you ll own part of the airline 
  will you put it in writing 
i ll have a letter of agreement
drafted up in two days 
what s your marketing strategy 
how will you return us to profitability 
why don t i give buddy an opportunity
to answer that  buddy 
thank you  gordon 
first  i want you all to know
that my door will always be open 
because i know from my dad
it s you guys that keep bluestar flying 
what i ve come up with here
is a basic three point plan 
one  we modernize  our computer
software is dogshit  we update it 
we squeeze every dollar
out of each mile flown 
don t sell a seat to a guy for 79 bucks
when he s willing to pay 379 
effective inventory management
will increase our load factor by 5 20  
that translates to approximately
 50 200 million in revenues 
the point being 
we can beat the majors at a price war 
two  advertising  more  and aggressive 
we attack the majors 
three  expansion  we expand our hubs
to atlanta  north carolina and st louis 
and we reorganize all
of our feeder schedules 
we gotta think big  guys 
we re going after the majors 
well  cards on the table  guys 
what do you say 
well  if you mean what you say 
i think we re probably in the ballpark 
  i guess i can take it to my people 
  good 
you ve sketched broad strokes 
i d like to see the fine print 
but i like what i hear so far 
i guess if a man lives long enough he gets
to see everything  and i do mean everything 
what else you got
in your bag of tricks  mr gekko 
frankly  carl  i can t see giving much more 
but  if you have any suggestions  i ll listen 
 there came into egypt
a pharaoh who did not know  
  i beg your pardon  is that a proverb 
  no  a prophecy 
the rich have been doing it
to the poor since time began 
the only difference is
the egyptians didn t allow unions 
i know what this guy s all about   greed 
he don t care about bluestar or the unions 
he s in for the buck  he don t take prisoners 
wait a minute  dad 
sure  what s worth doing
is worth doing for money 
it s a bad bargain if nobody gains 
and if we do this deal  everybody gains 
course  my son worked as a baggage handler
and freight loader for three summers 
with those qualifications 
he can run an airline 
fine  stay with the present management
dedicated to running you and
your airline into the ground 
that  scum  built the company up with one
plane and made something out of nothing 
if that s a scum  i ll take it over a rat any day 
you know where i stand  good night  all 
excuse me 
congratulations  dad  you did a great job
embarrassing me  not to mention yourself 
save the  workers unite  speech 
i heard it too much growing up 
  oh  yeah 
  you ll get axed  no two ways about it 
you and the whole shitty airline
are going down the tubes 
and if it isn t gekko 
it s gonna be some other killer 
he s using you  kid  he s got your prick
in his pocket  but you re too blind to see it 
no  i see a jealous old machinist
who can t stand the fact that his son s
more successful than he is 
what you see is a guy who never measured
a man s success by the size of his wallet 
that s because you never had the guts to go
out into the world and stake your own claim 
boy  if that s the way you feel 
i must ve done a really lousy job as a father 
as far as being axed  i m still around 
and i have a responsibility
to the union membership i represent 
your responsibility is to present the facts 
not opinions  to your men 
you ll destroy their lives 
let them decide for themselves 
my men will want to know what s
going on  and i won t lie to them 
oh  yeah  your men  your fuckin  men 
all my life your men have
been able to count on you 
why have you never been there for me  
what if you re wrong 
what if one day the sun didn t rise in the
east  and for once your compass was off 
would you be willing to wreck
your men s future  my future 
dad  think for a change  be practical 
i m asking you  i m fuckin  begging you 
i don t go to sleep with no whore
and i don t wake up with no whore 
that s how i live with myself 
i don t know how you do it 
i hope i m wrong about this guy   
but i ll let the men decide for themselves 
that much i promise you 
you should look at this  chief 
a guy at jackson steinem
buying large chunks of teldar paper
for an offshore account 
so  what s the problema 
  do you know what the fuck the problem is 
  what 
  you don t know 
  i don t know 
i get a strange call from the sec 
they asked to see my records 
  this is heavy  bud 
  hey  hey  hey  relax  relax  roger 
you re 82m in the account numbers
and i m the invisible man 
well  that s good for you  bud 
they re always looking for red flags 
gekko s always getting checked by  em 
they never come up with anything  rog 
hey    we re invulnerable on this one 
i just wanna slow down  bud 
all right 
no more lunches  no calls  all right 
we suspend our business  all right 
whatever you want  rog  it s cooi 
excuse me  hey  rog  can you come
back in  bring the cost report 
we re starting again 
gekko s asked us into the bluestar deal 
we re reviewing timetables 
  you wanna come 
  he didn t tell me about that 
you re only the president of the company 
what the hell do you know anyway  right 
guys  new chief of bluestar   bud fox 
  hi 
  hello  bud 
guys  what s the problem  it s time to kill 
gekko s got 12  of the stock and climbing 
plus he s got the unions in his back pocket 
everybody knows the stock s in play 
by next week the street will own bluestar 
is the bank financing in place 
or are we gonna sit around and have
more of these ridiculous meetings 
our firm committed weeks ago 25 
of the total long term debt structure 
unless you guys sign
this piece of paper right now 
i m gonna pull and go to
another bank for the 75 
look  we ve got 30 banks ready to participate
in a four year revolving credit line 
we must have your assurance you will pay
back most of the loan in the first 12 months 
the only way we can see this happening
is liquidating the hangars and the planes 
can you people guarantee
the liquidation of bluestar 
guarantee  no sweat 
we got the bleezburgs lined up
to build condos where the hangars are 
we lay the airplanes off to the mexicans 
who are dumb enough to buy  em 
and i got the texas boys drooling
at my kneecaps for the routes and slots 
what s your problem  it s done 
here s the price tags
on the 737s  gates  hangars  routes 
we got it nailed right down
to the typewriters 
the beauty of this deal
is the overfunded pension 
gekko makes  75m there 
50 million buys him the minimum
annuities for 6 000 employees 
and he walks away with the rest 
i figure he ll make    he ll clear  60 70m 
not bad for a month s work 
your boy really did his homework  fox 
and you ll have the shortest executive
career since that pope that got poisoned 
now he ll really start believing
he s gekko the great 
  he d like to change that appointment 
  hold this 
bud  you can t go in  he s in a meeting 
alex has come up with
an ingenious way for us to   
i didn t know we had a meeting today  sport 
i didn t  either 
i think we should talk  gordon 
  would you excuse us for a second 
  won t you come this way  gentlemen 
thank you  alex 
what do you want 
i just found out about
the garage sale at bluestar 
why 
last night i was reading rudy
winnie the pooh and the honeypot 
you know what happened  he stuck his nose
in the pot once too often  and he got stuck 
maybe you oughta read him pinocchio 
i thought you were gonna turn
bluestar around  not upside down 
  you fuckin  used me 
  you re walking around blind without a cane 
a fool and his money are lucky to even meet 
  why do you need to wreck this company 
  because it s wreckable  all right  
i took another look  i changed my mind 
if they lose their jobs 
they got nowhere to go 
my father has worked there for 24 years 
i gave him my word 
it s all about bucks  kid 
the rest is conversation 
buddy  you ll still be president 
when the time comes 
you ll parachute out a rich man 
with the money you ll make 
your dad s never got to work again 
so tell me  gordon 
when does it all end  huh 
how many yachts can you water ski behind 
how much is enough 
it s not a question of enough  pal 
it s a zero sum game 
somebody wins  somebody loses 
money itself isn t lost or made 
it s simply transferred
from one perception to another  like magic 
this painting here 
i bought it ten years ago for  60 000 
i could sell it today for six hundred 
the illusion has become real 
and the more real it becomes 
the more desperate they want it 
capitalism at its finest 
how much is enough  gordon 
the richest 1  of this country owns half
our country s wealth  five trillion dollars 
one third comes from hard work 
two thirds from inheritance 
interest on interest accumulating
to widows and idiot sons 
and what i do 
stock and real estate speculation 
it s bullshit 
you got 90  of the american public
with little or no net worth 
i create nothing 
i own 
we make the rules  pal 
the news  war  peace  famine  upheaval 
the price of a paper clip 
we pick that rabbit out of the hat while
everybody wonders how the hell we did it 
you re not naive enough to think we re
living in a democracy  are you  buddy 
it s the free market  and you re part of it 
yeah  you got that killer instinct 
stick around  pal 
i still got a lot to teach you 
obviously 
oh  buddy  come on 
i was gonna tell you about it 
calm down  all right 
we ll have dinner tonight  bring darien 
no  i can t make it tonight 
hey  buddy 
are you with me 
i need to know if you re with me 
i m with you  gordon 
  natalie  i ll be right there 
  yes  mr gekko 
  yeah 
  yeah  ollie 
tell them i want ziplocked mouths
on the bluestar deal 
or i ll come down there
and rip out their fuckin  throats 
bud 
what s going on 
i ve been played like a grand piano
by the master  gekko the great 
today was the big crash 
the liquidation sale 
he s gonna carve bluestar
into little pieces and sell it all off 
bastard 
i m sorry 
i was afraid something
like this could happen 
i handed it to him on a silver platter 
i told my father   
bud    bud  it s not your fault 
and it s not your decision 
i m not gonna let it happen 
don t cross gordon  he ll crush you 
if gordon doesn t buy bluestar  someone else
will  who s to say they won t do the same 
at least i won t be pulling the trigger 
why are you doing this 
you ve worked hard to get where you are 
we re so close 
you don t wanna throw it all away 
look  i can stay with the firm 
and you re doing fine 
we can survive without gordon gekko 
i m not looking to just survive 
i ve been doing that all my life 
cut this self pity crap  bud 
what the hell s that supposed to mean 
it means if you make an enemy of gordon
gekko  i can t be there to stand by you 
oh  yeah  do you really mean that 
what did he promise you 
to take you public 
without his money and seal of approval
i m not such a hot investment anymore 
  you re just the best money can buy  darien 
  you re not exactly pure  bud 
you went after gekko and me with
the same vengeance  look in the mirror 
i m looking  and i sure don t like what i see 
fair enough  but it s not that simple  bud 
when i was down and had nothing 
it was gordon who helped me 
he got me all my clients   you among them  
and he can take them away from me like that 
you may find out that when
you ve had money and lost it 
  it s worse than never having had it at all 
  oh  yeah 
that is bullshit 
you step out that door
and i am changing the locks 
you may not believe this  bud 
but i really do care for you 
we would ve made a good team 
i m sorry 
get the fuck outta here 
the market is dead right now 
even the rich are bitching 
the only thing moving is the termites
and cockroaches  and my commission   
look  save the rap  all right 
just sell the fucker  fast 
there he is 
where you been the last two days 
  janet  get my father on the phone and

but you have to trust me  ok 
i need to speak to the union members

i m proud of you 
the stock s at 19 1 4  and it s going up 
gekko figures  by breaking up bluestar 
it s 30 bucks a share

think he s making money 
how do you know it ll go up 
you don t wanna know  duncan 
let s just say i have some friends 
ok  what happens now 
when it hits 23  you go
to gekko and lower the boom 
when he learns he has no union
concessions  he ll jump ship 
yeah  but who ll buy then  and what s
to prevent some other shark devouring us 
we have an appointment to see mr wildman 
sir lawrence  or can i call you larry 
what would you say to owning bluestar
airlines  with union concessions 
at  18 a share 
and  in the process  hanging
gordon gekko out in the wind to twist 
i might be very interested  why you  mate 
what s a bloke like you
doing mixed up with gekko 
let s just say that me and mr gekko
have a serious conflict of interest 
but we all wanna see this airline work 
these figures show that it can 
you re prepared to take
these large salary cuts 
we are  but we want a contract
agreement that s ironclad 
so if you buy it  you can t break it up

the big wall street story today
was bluestar airlines 
fueled by takeover rumors  the stock
soared to an all time high of 24 1 8 
when rumors later surfaced
that the takeover was unfounded 
buyers ran for cover and the stock
plummeted to 16 1 2 before closing at 17 
then  amidst all the scuttlebutt 
another rumble shook the street 
raider sir lawrence wildman has stepped in
and bought a substantial block of bluestar 
and will announce a deal tomorrow
that includes the support of the unions 
we talked with a leading
stock market analyst 
in order to understand the ramifications   
son of a bitch
