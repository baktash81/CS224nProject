he was like a father to your father 
that makes you family too 
but    when    someone   
is good to you   
and you re not good to them back 
then bad things happen 
you do very well in school 
so i know this is not too complicated
for you to understand  am i right 
excellent 
now  your father had something that belonged
to don luis  it s a small thing 
not bigger than this 
do you know where it is 
well 
if you give it to me  don luis will be
very happy and very grateful 
so    why don t you just give me that
little thing  which belongs to him 
would you do that 
you re a smart girl

hello  young lady  where are we wanting
to go today 
chicago  that s not just down the street 
you know 
how much 
hey  kid  what are you doing here 
emilio 
there s a girl looking for you 
it does not matter 
her name is cataleya 
  cataleya   
  tio 
i thought you were dead 
you re safe 
it s okay 
you re safe now 
you re safe 
you have your mother s beautiful eyes 
don t be afraid 
this is your home 
how long has it been since you sleep 
i don t know  a long time ago 
well  good 
a young body needs to sleep 
when i was your age 
i would sleep half the day 
i don t know if it helps
with your growing pattern 
but i was always ready
for what came after 
whose room did i sleep in 
my son 
your cousin 
where is he 
he s dead 
killed 
yes 
by whom 
no one who is still alive 
you are very talented 
  is this what you want to be  an artist 
  i used to want to be like xena 
a warrior princess 
not any more 
no 
i want to be a killer 
can you help 
sure 
normally we don t accept students
in the middle of the academic year 
but under these circumstances 
losing her parents in a tragic car accident 
here you are  these are   
the school supplies you ll need 
sorry   
she s a little traumatized 
of course 
see you monday  cataleya 
such a pretty name 
thanks 
after we get all this stuff 
we go over to maxwell street   
to get hot dogs
from those polish people here 
you like hot dog 
what is it now 
that school has nothing to teach me 
i told you what i want 
you don t want to help me  fine 
i ll do it myself 
look 
see that 
is that what you want 
you want me to teach you how to be
a killer  sure  no problema  i ll teach you 
but you ll be dead in five years 
if you want to be a killer and survive 
you got to be a smart one 
you have to know things besides
how to pull a trigger 
you have to know how the world works 
how people think   
you gotta learn how to stand 
how to be psychological 
and i cannot teach you that
unless you learn the basics out of school 
you got that  hmm 
come on  what s it going to be 
cataleya  you choose

twenty two murders in the last four years
all with the same mo 
i think i m right 
he is sending a message   
but i m beginning to believe
it s not meant for us 
well  we re the only ones
with that information 
well  we re not getting anywhere
with it  are we 
put it out to the press 
it s time 
the word  this lipstick drawing 
i want it splashed over every newspaper 
every magazine  front page  national 
the message ain t meant for us 
let s make sure it gets
to who it s intended for 
mr  richard 
  marco 
  it s been a long time 
yes  it has 
how is the hand 
it only hurts   
when it s humid 
well  you should ve let us relocate you
to arizona instead of new orleans 
yeah  right 
but the boss likes it humid 
he s waiting for you 
what do you think 
hm 
  coincidence 
  twenty two times 
a flower that only grows
in one place on earth 
couldn t it be the calling card of   
shoot  i forgot his name 
what s his name 
your former partner 
you know  the one who used to do
your wetwork 
  fabio 
  fabio 
fabio restrepo 
may i 
the cia is not an amusement park 
when the agency extracted your ass
from colombia 15 years ago   
and set you up here  we allowed you
to resume you little business 
but what we should ve done
was lock you away for life 
now  in exchange 
you should ve kept the information flowing 
  and i have 
  not much 
  i have nothing to do with this 
  then find out who did 
she s talking to us 
could be anyone 
you idiot  i told you 
everyone dead  down to the dog 
you screwed it up the first time 
now  go fix it 
each and every one of the victims
was a professional bad apple 
as for motive 
i m narrowing it down to  uh   
payback  but  um   
not much else 
my best guess  alexa milshinova 
she made a career out of getting intimate
with high stake gamblers out of vegas 
she would  uh    rip  em off and then
send them to meet their maker 
here 
d angelo james 
he tried to take over the heroin trade
from houston
from the  uh   
gemini cartel 
if you do not know  all there is to know
about these twins   
you should not be in this room 
now you see 
he tilts the camera just enough 
so he won t be seen going into the cell 
the time 
1 55 am 
that means that our perp
was in that station  that   
i don t have to spell it out for you 
do i 
excuse me 
hand these out  please 
these are the names  addresses
and phone numbers of everyone   
with a pulse who was in that station
before 1 55 am

i want you to locate the ten people
in the folder you ve just been handed 
i want a detailed dossier on each of them
for the last ten years of their lives
