twentytwo murders in the last four years
all with the same mo
i think im right
he is sending a message
but im beginning to believe
its not meant for us
well were the only ones
with that information
well were not getting anywhere
with it are we
put it out to the press
its time
the word this lipstick drawing
i want it splashed over every newspaper
every magazine front page national
the message aint meant for us
lets make sure it gets
to who its intended for
mr richard
marco
its been a long time
yes it has
how is the hand
it only hurts
when its humid
well you shouldve let us relocate you
to arizona instead of new orleans
yeah right
but the boss likes it humid
hes waiting for you
what do you think
hm
coincidence
twentytwo times
a flower that only grows
in one place on earth
couldnt it be the calling card of
shoot i forgot his name
whats his name
your former partner
you know the one who used to do
your wetwork
fabio
fabio
fabio restrepo
may i
the cia is not an amusement park
when the agency extracted your ass
from colombia 15 years ago
and set you up here we allowed you
to resume you little business
but what we shouldve done
was lock you away for life
now in exchange
you shouldve kept the information flowing
and i have
not much
i have nothing to do with this
then find out who did
shes talking to us
could be anyone
you idiot i told you
everyone dead down to the dog
you screwed it up the first time
now go fix it
each and every one of the victims
was a professional bad apple
as for motive
im narrowing it down to uh
payback but um
not much else
my best guess alexa milshinova
she made a career out of getting intimate
with high stake gamblers out of vegas
she would uh rip em off and then
send them to meet their maker
here
dangelo james
he tried to take over the heroin trade
from houston
from the uh
gemini cartel
if you do not know all there is to know
about these twins
you should not be in this room
now you see
he tilts the camera just enough
so he wont be seen going into the cell
the time
155 am
that means that our perp
was in that station that
i dont have to spell it out for you
do i
excuse me
hand these out please
these are the names addresses
and phone numbers of everyone
with a pulse who was in that station
before 155 am
everyone
which means one of them was our target
i want you to locate the ten people
in the folder youve just been handed
i want a detailed dossier on each of them
for the last ten years of their lives
i want you to run down every lead
we will check every story
coz our killer ladies and gentleman
is in those folders
and i mean to catch him
before he kills again
dont move
