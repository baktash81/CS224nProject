thank you sir

yeah
yeah me too
elliot

tough morning huh
i barely lasted two minutes
in that ice bath
course i suppose
nasas more interested
in the psychological reaction
well
i think i made it pretty clear
that i thought it was cold
elliot laughs
door opens
armstrong
good luck
you too
another egghead
bob gilruth
neil weve been chatting
with candidates
about the program
as you know our decision
to forgo direct ascent
in favor of a lunar orbit
rendezvous approach
to the eventual moon mission
has had a major impact
on gemini
do you have any thoughts
on that decision
well even considering
von brauns initial criticism
it seems that the payload saved
by parking the primary vehicle
in orbit
and sending a smaller ship down
to the lunar surface
is well worth
the resulting challenges
what do you see
as the challenges
neil
cislunar navigation for one
and rendezvous and docking
why do you think
space flights important
i had a few uh
opportunities in the x15
to observe the atmosphere
it was so thin
such a small part of the earth
you could barely see it at all
and when youre down here
in the crowd
and you look up it
it looks pretty big
and you dont think
about it too much
but when you get
a different vantage point
it changes your perspective
i dont know what
space exploration will uncover
but i dont think
itll be exploration
just for the sake
of exploration
i think itll be more the fact
that it allows us to see things
that maybe we should have seen
a long time ago
but just havent been able to
until now
does anyone have anything else
man yeah
neil i was sorry to hear
about your daughter
im sorry is there a question
um what i
what i mean is uh
do you think
it will have an effect
i think it would be
unreasonable to assume
that it wouldnt have
some effect
bob
all right neil
thank you thats fine
thank you
thank you for your time
phone rings
hello
yeah sure neil
hello
can i go play outside
yeah mutters
yes sir
thank you sir
janet hangs up phone
i got it
its a fresh start
are you sure
yeah
whispers hey
kisses
itll be an adventure
male narrator
since the time of jules verne
man has imagined
traveling to the moon
the old idea of how to get
to the moon
was to send one spacecraft
all the way there and back
however nasa engineers have
developed a modern approach
where one rocket
contains several ships
that will make the journey
together
just as columbus took a rowboat
from the santa mar√≠a
to the shore of the new world
the astronauts will take
a smaller spacecraft
from the mother ship
down to the lunar surface
when its time to return
the smaller craft will lift off
from the surface
and dock with the mother ship
which will then power the crew
back to earth
thus thanks to
the brilliant minds of nasa
the ageold dream of going
to the moon
will soon be achieved

weve got a boy rick
pat
how old is he
hes five and a half
oh well we should get them
together
deke
if we want to get this done
we need to prove that two ships
can find each other in orbit
and dock without crashing
thats the primary mission
of project gemini
when we think youre ready
each of you will be assigned
a flight with a specific task
only after we master
all these tasks
do we move on to apollo
consider trying to land
on the moon
its nice to meet you
and you pat
bye

its necessary to determine
what the right sizing is
of those stages
hi
hi
you okay
yeah
clears throat just thinking
about this lecture
its kind of neat
whats neat about it
well it was about how
to rendezvous with the agena
if you thrust
itit actually slows you down
because it puts you
into a higher orbit
so you have to reduce thrust
and drop into a lower orbit
in order to catch up
itsits backwards from what
they teach you as a pilot
but if you work the math
ititit follows
its kind of neat
yeah
whats funny
no its not funny
its just
its kind of neat

cernan told me cloud cover
was down to 500 feet
probably never
saw the building
clearly the error
was the approach
he was coming in too slow
to reach the runway
what
you know deke had
his doubts about him
thats why he moved elliot
off eight
deke gave elliot
his own command
elliot wasnt
aggressive enough
you of all people
have to know that
no i dont
i didnt investigate the crash
i didnt study
the flight trajectory
and i wasnt the one
flying the plane
so i wouldnt pretend
to know anything
well never be
a hundred percent sure

naha search one
well id like to argue
with them
about the going home
but im
not sure how we can
yeah
i just keep thinking is there
anything else that we forgot
we did everything
as far as i know
bob gemini 8 saw
two complex vehicles
launched on the same day
on time
cameras clicking
we saw flawless rendezvous
and docking
all of which is tended
to be overshadowed
by the malfunction but uh
i think we should focus
on the progress
resulting from the mission
george mueller
the board would like to focus
on the malfunction
neil walk us through
the decision
to separate from the agena
reporters clamoring
man you mentioned
that the rate of revolution
was more than once a second
how near were you
to being unconscious
george
did you think to use the agena
to stabilize
the combined craft
we did
this was uh not successful
as i said we initially assumed
that the anomaly was with
the agena control system
cause there was no way to know
that a thruster
was causing the
if we could have uh isolated
each of geminis thrusters
if wed had that capability
in the moment
reporters clamoring
agence france did you have
any feeling of anxiety
after the failure
of the thrusters
in the midst of the spinning
did you seem to realize
or feel the presence of god
closer than other times
with this so hot
on the heels of the loss
of charlie bassett
and elliot see
do you question whether
the programs worth the cost
in money and in lives

i should hope so given the
time weve spent developing it
half the country doesnt think
its worth it anymore
uh well
we we learned to fly
only 60 years ago
so if you consider
the technological developments
in the context of history
its really not
im considering it in the
context of taxpayer dollars
james

ed
a lot of people forget about
the influence
that the lunar program has
on the raising of our
young people in the country
i think that if a civilization
doesnt look out
if it doesnt try
to expand its horizons
then were not going
to progress as a nation
mike wallace over tv
at 1030 tonight eastern time
rescue teams began
to remove the bodies
of the three astronauts
from the charred spacecraft
a nasa spokesman
said the dead astronauts
were left in the ship
for four hours
to aid the investigation
into the tragedy
and according to the
latest information from nasa
at the manned spacecraft center
in houston
the first apollo flight
which was scheduled for
february the 21st is now

political fallout

with all due respect sir
its not my job to worry
about the political fallout
the damn thing
could have killed you
well it didnt
a split second more
and you would not be

interviewer
youve lately taken
a couple of swipes
at the space program
i think it would be interesting
to uh talk more
about whether this
is the proper thing
to do with public treasury
is the sort of dreams
i would have
would be a habitable
new york city for instance
it would seem to me
that that would be
a reasonable thing to do
interviewer
whwhat has been the reaction
of your friends in this
woman well they mostly think
that its ridiculous
that were spending
so much money
to go somewhere where
we dont know anything about
and that the money
could be used
for a lot more helpful things
crowd cheering

whiteys on the moon
jesus thats a big mother

congress wouldnt fund us

why else would nasa
be sending a rocket
thats had one issue
after another to the moon
thanks for the insight buzz
drumbeat from
whitey on the moon continues
always a pleasure with you
oh it doesnt matter
hes not in the lunar lottery
and you are
well the only guys
they let on the lltv
since neils accident

man over speakers

wed like you to command
okay
turns off faucet
walter cronkite
i can see a helicopter
vectoring that way
it looks like a red dot
with a long long tail
a long plume
thats got to be
the spacecraft
that has to be
apollo 10 reentering
and so the flight of apollo 10
has performed the major
function of its mission
it has proved through
these daring three astronauts
that uh all of the systems
work properly
and that there should be
no reason why man cannot
perhaps as early as july
land on that picked spot
on the moons equator
these are sailors of the sky
and what uh
weve seen and heard today
make the great ocean voyages
of the earthbound
seem well
earthbound indeed
for as the poet wrote
the crew of apollo 10
has slipped
the surly bonds of earth
and carried us over
into tomorrow
in the past few hours
man has come closer to the moon
than ever in his history
there were those
terrifying moments when
mom whats wrong
hmm
whats wrong
nothing honey
your dads going to the moon
okay
can i go outside
sure
running steps
clears throat
uh were here today
to talk about
the forthcoming flight
but were able to talk
about it because of uh
previous flights
every flight
took on new objectives
and left us with very few
additions to be completed
were very grateful to those
people who made it possible
for us to be here today
deke all right
well take some questions now
jim
neil when you learned you were
going to command this flight
were you surprised
overjoyed
i was pleased
okay but how would you compare
this feeling
to winning an automobile
or being selected
as an astronaut
i was pleased
brian
neil if it does turn out
youll go down in history
what kind of thoughts
do you have about that
when the thought hits you uh
gosh suppose
that flights successful
were planning on that flight
being successful
brian
uh ii just meant
how you feel about
being a part of history
i think i can shed
some light here
its a responsibility
but its exciting
to be the first
even my wife is excited
she keeps slipping
jewelry into my ppk
laughter
youre planning on taking some of her jewelry
to the moon buzz
sure
whwhat fella wouldnt want
to give his wife
bragging rights
laughter
neil will you take anything
uh if i had a choice
id take more fuel
scattered laughing
deke all right next question
i thought you
were gonna talk to the boys
what did you want me to say

an exact number
i dont want
a fucking number neil
its not zero is it
is it
no
no its not
pat doesnt have a husband
those kids they dont
have a father anymore

what that means
what are the chances
thats gonna be ricky and mark
and i i cant tell them
that their dad spent
the last few minutes
packing his briefcase
youre gonna sit em down
both of them
and youre gonna prepare them
for the fact
that you might not
ever come home
youre doing that
you
not me
im done
so you better start thinking
about what youre gonna say
sighs
jimmy asked
what youre gonna say
when you get onto the moon
well were not sure
were gonna get onto the moon
uh a lot of things
have to go right
before that happens
how long will you be gone
um well
we launch in ten days
well be up for eight and then
about a month in quarantine
whats quarantine
well be in isolation
uh to protect
in case we uh
carry any diseases
from the lunar surface
or something of that nature
its not likely
but its a precaution
so you wont be here
for my swim meet
smacks lips
no
sorry
does anyone have
any other questions
do you think
youre coming back
we have real confidence
in the mission
and uh there are some risks
but we have every intention
of coming back
but you might not
smacks lips
thats right
okay
okay time for bed
bob
fate has ordained
that the men who went
to the moon to explore in peace
will stay on the moon
to rest in peace
these brave men neil
armstrong and edwin aldrin
know there is no hope
for their recovery
they will be mourned
by their families
they will be
mourned by a mother earth
that dared send two
of her sons into the unknown
for every human being
who looks up at the moon
in the nights to come
will know that
there is some corner
of another world
that is forever mankind

bob simon at trafalgar square
where he joined the thousands
who watched an immense
television screen
as the apollo touched down
on the moon
reporter 2 the average
romanian thinks of apollo 11
a little bit
as his own personal adventure
reporter 3 its been estimated
that the audience
was up in the hundreds
of millions
perhaps 400 million persons
or so watching this broadcast
reporter 4
countless millions more
listened on the radio
to the voices from the moon
never before had so many people
been attuned to one event
at one time
overlapping broadcasts
in different languages
reporter 5

the landing on the moon
reporter 8

reporter 9
and in washington
an anonymous citizen
placed a small bouquet
on the grave of john f kennedy
with a note
mr president
the eagle has landed
and indeed on this day as we
mark the astronauts return
its hard not to think back
upon that speech
our 35th president gave
just seven short years ago
kennedy if this capsule
history of our progress
teaches us anything
it is that man
in his quest for knowledge
and progress
is determined
and cannot be deterred
but why some say the moon
why choose this as our goal
and they may well ask
why climb the highest mountain
why 35 years ago
fly the atlantic
why does rice play texas
we choose to go to the moon
we choose to go to the moon
cheering and applause
we choose to go to the moon
in this decade
and do the other things
not because they are easy
but because they are hard
clamoring
