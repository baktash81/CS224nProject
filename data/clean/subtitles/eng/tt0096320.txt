julius already knew
that he was the product
of a scientific experiment
conducted by the american government
a topsecret experiment designed
to produce a physically
mentally and spiritually
advanced human being
he knew that
unlike other little boys
he had not one but six fathers
all very distinguished men
especially chosen for
their genetic excellence
and of course
he knew about mary ann benedict
the remarkable young woman
who was selected to be his mother
sadly he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge
that his mother died
while giving birth to him
now what julius did not know
not until this very moment
was that about a minute
after he was born
his mother gave birth
to another baby boy
i have a brother
ya
he was sent to an orphanage
in los angeles
at the same time
i brought you here to the island
julius had spent his entire life
here on the island
helping me with my research
i always thought he was happy
and had no desire to leave
how wrong i was
i must find him
julius julius
wait wait
i couldnt believe he was going
he wasnt equipped to deal
with the outside world
all of his knowledge was from books
julius could speak 12 languages
he excelled in history science
mathematics literature
he was pure in body and in spirit
ahhh
but for the first time
julius would not listen to me
hes probably just like me
the nearest island with
an airport was 27 miles away
but julius did not care
he had become obsessed
with the idea
that his brother vincent
was in some kind of trouble
and desperately needed his help

the more cheese the merrier
there you go
i know youre probably used to
growing your own vegetables

but here on the mainland
we just nuke it
thats it here we go
feast your eyes
dinner is served
yummy
yeah
ahhh
ahhh
through the lips over the gums
look out
look out stomach here it comes
tadum
julius
oh i like nuked food
mmmmm
mmm
now let me get
this straight
one of our fathers was
a famous football player
yes
and another one was
a physicist at mit
yes he won the nobel prize
naturally all of our dads
were these big shots
and mom
was like superwoman
but she didnt survive
the delivery
and i was sent
to an orphanage
while you were raised
on a tropical paradise
by a scientist who
you do research for
but who doesnt pay you
because you dont need money
did i leave anything out
i think its important we try
to find our fathers
oh you mean the geniuses
who contributed
to the sperm milk shake
why are you being so immature
about all this
do you know how many times
ive heard stories like this
its every
orphans fantasy
my real mom and dad
were rich
and beautiful
but there was a mixup
in the hospital
and i got switched
with another baby
but one day theres gonna
be a knock at the door
and there theyll be
with open arms
crying my darling
my treasure
we didnt know
how can we make
it up to you
let me tell you something
for your own good julius
its a crock
i liberated this from
my file at the orphanage
here it is
read it and weep
dear sister anderson your request
for orphans benefits
for vincent benedict has been denied
denied yeah
according to our files
his mother did not die
during birth
shes not dead
we have a current
address for her at
172 canyon glen drive
los angeles
vincents case seems to be
one of simple abandonment
and as such
hes ineligible for aid
thats right julius
she abandoned me
this letter was written
30 years ago
we were five years old
our mother didnt die
when we were born
you knew all this time
where she was
and you never
contacted her
i dont know about your mother
miss perfect 1952
but my mother was a slut
and if shes still alive
i hope shes
in a lot of pain
she dumped me once
there is no way im gonna give
her a chance to do it again
if they have lied to us about mama
for all these years
maybe they lied to her too
we got to find her
we have to check this address
you do what you want
i got a cashflow problem
hello
hey vince we havent
forgotten about you
you better have our money
tomorrow morning or else
or else what you blimp

very bad professionally

the parking attendant
thought we were going to hawaii
the parking attendant
he liked the car
we put on those loud shirts
