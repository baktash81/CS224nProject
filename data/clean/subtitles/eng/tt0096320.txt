julius already knew
that he was the product   
of a scientific experiment   
conducted by the american government 
a top secret experiment designed
to produce a physically 
mentally and spiritually
advanced human being 
he knew that 
unlike other little boys 
he had not one  but six fathers   
all very distinguished men   
especially chosen for
their genetic excellence 
and of course 
he knew about mary ann benedict 
the remarkable young woman   
who was selected to be his mother 
sadly  he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge   
that his mother died
while giving birth to him 
now  what julius did not know 
not until this very moment 
was that about a minute
after he was born   
his mother gave birth
to another baby boy 
i have a brother 
ya 
he was sent to an orphanage
in los angeles   
at the same time
i brought you here to the island 
julius had spent his entire life
here on the island 
helping me with my research 
i always thought he was happy 
and had no desire to leave 
how wrong i was 
i must find him 
julius  julius 
wait  wait 
i couldn t believe he was going 
he wasn t equipped to deal
with the outside world 
all of his knowledge was from books 
julius could speak 12 languages 
he excelled in history  science 
mathematics  literature 
he was pure in body and in spirit 
ahhh 
but for the first time 
julius would not listen to me 
he s probably just like me 
the nearest island with
an airport was 27 miles away 
but julius did not care 
he had become obsessed
with the idea   
that his brother  vincent 
was in some kind of trouble   
and desperately needed his help

ta dum 
  julius 
  oh  i like nuked food 
  mm mmm

now let me get
this straight 
one of our fathers was
a famous football player 
  yes 
  and another one was   
  a physicist at m i t  
  yes  he won the nobel prize 
naturally  all of our dads
were these big shots 
and mom   
was like    superwoman 
but she didn t survive
the delivery 
and i was sent
to an orphanage 
while you were raised
on a tropical paradise   
by a scientist who
you do research for 
but who doesn t pay you 
because you don t need money 
did i leave anything out 
i think it s important we try
to find our fathers 
oh  you mean the geniuses
who contributed   
to the sperm milk shake 
why are you being so immature
about all this 
do you know how many times
i ve heard stories like this 
it s every
orphan s fantasy 
my real mom and dad
were rich   
and beautiful 
but there was a mix up
in the hospital   
and i got switched
with another baby 
but one day  there s gonna
be a knock at the door   
and there they ll be   
with open arms 
crying   my darling 
 my treasure 
we didn t know 
how can we make
it up to you  
let me tell you something
for your own good  julius 
it s a crock 
i liberated this from
my file at the orphanage 
here it is 
read it and weep 
 dear sister anderson  your request
for orphan s benefits   
   for vincent benedict has been denied 
  denied  yeah 
 according to our files 
his mother did not die   
   during birth 
  she s not dead 
 we have a current
address for her at   
 172 canyon glen drive 
los angeles 
 vincent s case seems to be
one of simple abandonment 
and as such 
he s ineligible for aid  
that s right  julius 
she abandoned me 
this letter was written
30 years ago 
we were five years old 
our mother didn t die
when we were born 
you knew all this time
where she was   
and you never
contacted her 
i don t know about your mother 
 miss perfect  1952  
but my mother was a slut
and if she s still alive 
i hope she s
in a lot of pain 
she dumped me once 
there is no way i m gonna give
her a chance to do it again 
if they have lied to us about mama
for all these years 
maybe they lied to her  too 
we got to find her 
  we have to check this address 
  you do what you want 
i got a cash flow problem 
  hello 
  hey  vince  we haven t
forgotten about you 
you better have our money
tomorrow morning  or else 
or else what  you blimp

  driving that car down to texas 
i got my driving gloves 
i got my driving glasses 
i got my driving hat 
but i got no car 
the car was there 
the merchandise was in the trunk

  whoa  whoa  let me explain 
sit down 
i got a reputation
to uphold 
people put their trust in me 
they know i always
deliver the goods   
and i always come
back with the money 
this is making me look
very bad professionally 
  this is bullshit  the car was there 
  that s right 
the parking attendant
thought we were going to hawaii 
  the parking attendant 
  he liked the car 
we put on those loud shirts
so we d look like tourists 
you know 
i just realized that   
in over 20 years of service 
not one of my clients   
has ever seen my face 
i don t think that s
a problem  hey
