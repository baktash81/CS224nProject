foxes hold their wedding
processions in this weather 
and they don t like
anyone to see them 
lf you do 
they ll be very angry 
you went and saw   
    something you shouldn t have 
l can t let you in now 
an angry fox came looking for you 
he left this 
you re supposed to kill yourself 
go quickly and ask
their forgiveness 
give the knife back and tell them
how sorry you are 
they don t usually forgive 
you must be ready to die 
get going 
unless they forgive you 
l can t let you in 
but l don t know where they live 
you ll find out 
on days like this
there are always rainbows 
foxes live under the rainbows 
the peach orchard
take this  big sister 
thanks 
weren t there six of you 
you were six  so l brought
six of them 
you re wrong  but you can
have the extra one 
l already had mine 
that s strange

we ll never go to your house again

your family   
   cut down all the peach trees   
    in this orchard 
but   doll day   is for the peach blossoms 
lt s to celebrate their arrival 
we dolls personify the peach tree 
we are the spirits of the trees 
the life of the blossoms 
how can you celebrate
with these trees cut down 
those vanished trees
are weeping in their sorrow 
don t cry  tears won t help 
stop blaming him 
this child cried
when they cut down our trees 
he even tried to stop them 
yes  because he likes peaches 
no 
peaches can be bought 
but where can you buy
a whole orchard in bloom 
l love this orchard   
   and the peach trees
which bloomed here 
but they re not here anymore 
that s why l cried 
very well  l understand 
he is a good boy 
shall we allow him   
   to see our peach orchard
in bloom once more 
the bllzzard

my mother made for me 
l remember it well 
you told me that before 
you were shot  you fainted 
then you woke up  l was tending you
and you told me that story 
lt was a dream  you dreamt it
while you were unconscious 
lt was so strong l still remember it 
but after five minutes or so you died 
you really died 
l see 
but my parents   
   don t believe l m dead 
that s my home 
my mother and father   
   are there   
   still waiting for me

third platoon returning to base  sir 
no casualties 
listen 
l understand how you must feel 
nevertheless   
   the third platoon was annihilated 
you were all killed in action 
l m sorry 
l wasn t killed  l survived 
l can hardly look you in the face 
l sent you out to die 
l was to blame 
l could place all the responsibility   
   on the stupidity of war 
but l can t blame that 
l can t deny my thoughtlessness 
my misconduct 
however   
   l was taken prisoner 
l suffered so much in the camp
that l felt dying was easier 
and   
   now   
   as l look at you   
   l feel that same pain 
l know that your suffering and torture
were much greater 
but   
   honestly   
   l   
   l would have wanted to die with you 
l really would have 
believe me 
l feel your bitterness 
they call you   heroes     
   but you died   
   like dogs 
however   
   returning to the world
like this proves nothing 
please 
go back 
go back and rest in peace

hello 
do you know
where vincent van gogh lives 
you looking for him 
he crossed the bridge
and went that way 
thanks 
but   
   be careful  he s been
in a lunatic asylum 
aren t you vincent van gogh 
mount fuji ln red
what is it 
what s happening 
has fuji erupted 
how terrible 
lt s worse than that 
didn t you know 
the nuclear power
plant has exploded 
the six atomic reactors 
they re exploding one after another 
japan is so small there s no escape 
we all know that 
no way out  but still we have to try 
no other way 
this is the end 
but   
   what happened 
where did all those people go 
where did they escape to 
to the bottom of the sea 
the dolphins 
even they re leaving 
lucky dolphins 
they can swim away 
lt won t help 
the radioactivity will get them 
the clouds   
   the red one 
lt s plutonium 239 
10 000 000th of a gram causes cancer 
the yellow one is strontium 90 
lt gets inside you   
   and causes leukemia 
the purple one is cesium 137 
lt affects reproduction 
lt causes mutations 
lt makes monstrosities 
man s stupidity is unbelievable 
radioactivity was invisible 
and because of its danger  they colored it 
but that only lets you know
which kind kills you 
death s calling card 
see you later 
wait 
radiation doesn t kill you at once 
so what 
a slow death is even worse 
l refuse to die slowly  adults dying  
they ve lived long enough already 
but the children haven t even
lived yet  lt s unfair 
waiting to die isn t living 
they told us that nuclear plants were safe 
human accident is the danger 
not the nuclear plant itself 
no accidents  no danger  that s
what they told us  what liars 
lf they re not hanged for this 
l ll kill them myself 
don t worry  the radioactivity
will do that for you 
l m sorry 
l am one of those who deserve to die 
the weeplng demon
human  aren t you 
what s wrong 
are you a demon 
l suppose so 
but l used to be human 
what a world 
how stupid 
long ago   
   this place was a beautiful field
of flowers 
then those nuclear bombs 
those missiles   
   turned it into this desert 
now   
   because of all that fallout   
   strange flowers grow 
dandelions 
dandelions 
monster dandelions 
this is a rose 
the stem grows from the flower   
   and a strange bud at the top 
this is all radiation polluted 
lt makes this mutation 
the flowers are crippled 
not only flowers 
human beings  too  look at me 
stupid mankind did this 
lt made our planet a junkyard
for poisonous wastes 
nature has vanished from the earth 
the nature we used to enjoy 
we ve lost the birds  animals  fish 
some time ago   
   l saw a two faced hare   
   a one eyed bird   
   and a hairy fish 
how do you eat then 
there s no food 
we feed on ourselves 
the weak ones go first 
lt s about my turn now 
even here  we have grades 
one horn demons like myself always get   
   eaten by those
who have two or three horns 
before  they were powerful and pretentious 
and now they still throw
their weight around as demons 
so  let them have their way 
let them have all those horns 
so  let them live in torture 
looking the way they do 
lt s hell 
worse than death 
they can t die even if they want to 
that s their punishment  
immortality 
tortured by their sins   
   they must suffer forever 
they ll eat me soon  l ll be released 
but l don t want to be eaten 
that s why l m running away 
but then l get so hungry that   
   l feel disgusted with myself 
l was a farmer when l was a man 
l dumped gallons of milk
in the river to keep the prices up 
l buried potatoes and cabbages
with a bulldozer 
how stupid 
hear that 
when night comes   
   those famous demons
scream out in pain 
their horns hurt them worse than a cancer 
they pray for death  but are condemned
to live in pain for eternity 
but no one kills them 
so they just scream 
come  l ll show you 
you ll see how they cry 
my horn s beginning to hurt  too 
go away 
go where 
do you want to become a demon  too 
village of the watermills
good day 
good day 
good day 
good day 
what s the name of this village 
doesn t have one 
we just call it   the village   
some people call it watermill village 
do all the villagers live here 
no 
they live in other places 
there s no electricity here 
don t need it 
people get too used to convenience 
they think convenience is better 
they throw out what s truly good 
but what about lights 
we ve got candles and linseed oil 
but night s so dark 
yes  that s what night is supposed to be 
why should night be as bright as day 
l wouldn t like nights so bright
you couldn t see the stars 
you have paddies 
but no tractors to cultivate them 
don t need them 
we ve got cows  and horses 
what do you use for fuel 
firewood mostly 
we don t feel right  chopping down trees 
but   
   enough fall down by themselves 
we cut them up and use them as firewood 
and if you make charcoal from the wood   
   just a few trees can give you
as much heat as a whole forest 
yes  and cow dung make good fuel  too 
we try to live the way man used to 
that s the natural way of life 
people today have forgotten   
   they re really just a part of nature 
yet  they destroy the nature   
   on which our lives depend 
they always think
they can make something better 
especially scientists 
they may be smart but   
   most don t understand   
   the heart of nature 
they only invent things that
in the end make people unhappy 
yet they re so proud of their inventions 
what s worse  most people are  too 
they view them   
   as if they were miracles 
they worship them 
they don t know it 
but they re losing nature 
they don t see that they re going to perish 
the most important things
for human beings are   
   clean air and clean water   
   and the trees and grass
that produce them 
everything is being dirtied   
   polluted forever 
dirty air  dirty water   
   dirtying the hearts of men 
on my way here  l happened to see   
   some children putting flowers
on a stone beside the bridge 
why 
oh  that 
my father told me once 
long ago   
   a sick traveller died by the bridge 
the villagers took pity
and buried him right there 
they placed a large
stone on his tomb   
   and put flowers on it 
lt became a custom to put flowers there 
not only the children 
all the villagers   
   put flowers there as they pass   
   though most don t know why 
ls there a celebration today 
no  a funeral 
you find this strange 
a nice  happy funeral 
lt s good   
   to work hard   
   and live long and then be thanked 
we have no temple or priest here 
so all the villagers   
   carry the dead   
   to the cemetery on the hill 
we don t like it
when young adults or children die 
lt s hard to celebrate such a loss 
but fortunately   
   the people of this village
lead a natural way of life 
so they pass on at a ripe old age 
the woman we re burying today   
   lived to be ninety nine 
you must excuse me   
   but l m going to join the procession 
to tell the truth   
   she was my first love 
but broke my heart   
   and left me for another 
by the way  how old are you 
me 
one hundred plus three 
a good age to stop living
