mary roberts  paige callahan 
tamara ewing 
i only asked for roberts 
yeah  well 
all the victims were hookers 
they were all found drugged
and stabbed to death
on the same night in the same location 
you gotta be kidding me 
yeah  i m hilarious 
i never figured you to be so hip 
yeah  they must have   
must have changed owners 
you want something to drink 
don t worry  i won t tell 
where are you from  originally 
the valley 
where are you from 
 originally 
 mississippi valley 
alabama  birmingham 
well  here s to being from somewhere 
 cheers 
 cheers 
all right  last night s victims   
so we got six now 
one  julie brock  never left home 
three from the north county 
bodies dumped here 
two from here 
bodies dumped in north county 
and who said busing doesn t work 
all knifed  all gagged  all bound 
all very organized killings 
not a lot of wasted motion 
 so  i got a question  why 
 why what 
first  geography 
yep  guy s a shark 
if he stops  he dies 
he likes to drive 
probably has a decent car 
maybe two  high mileage 
can t find one
in the neighborhood  a victim 
then  uh  he goes
wherever opportunity knocks 
all right  next  why   why the
extreme torture  then the love bites 
turns him on 
no rape  no sodomy 
 no genital mutilation  hm 
 he kills for sexual pleasure 
was stan peters our boy 
god  i hope not 
all right  back to the living  our boy 
he s got balls 
i ll give him that 
he goes back to julie s house 
a few days after he kills her 
moves her body  shaves her legs 
poses her  he brings beer 
milk  food 
just threw himself a little party 
and they found partially digested meat
in her stomach 
but she was a vegan  strict vegetarian 
she d never touch it 
same as ana  no way 
not even with a knife to her throat 
nobody wants to eat alone 
mm 
one last  why  
why are you trying to solve
a five year old case
that everyone else has forgotten about 
farris and i were   
a couple of miles away 
we heard a call over the radio 
screams reported 
sal was first one on the scene 
no lights 
switching problem  guy from edison
said it happens once every decade or so 
now  you see the woman behind me
 over my left shoulder 
 yeah 
gladys fulcher  spinster 
sort of eyes and ears
of the neighborhood 
a pain in the ass to the cops
but a godsend to a detective 
and what did
good old gladys have to say 
said she was out  she lied about it
at first out of sheer embarrassment 
but she came clean 
what was she embarrassed about 
she went on her first date in 15 years 
slept at the old guy s house 
so  the night of the hat trick 
we had no lights 
gladys getting boned   
two million to one long shot
crossing the finish line
in a dead heat 
third strike 
drought 
no water  no mud  no prints 
ground was hard like cement 
victims were placed on that rock
right there 
they were drugged elsewhere  but they
were brought here  stabbed to death 
posed facing each other 
bags over their heads  laid down 
like the rock was a table  like a   
tea party 
where the guests fell asleep 
warm  this just went down 
and where was your third victim 
close by 
you work the evidence 
you still come up with zeros 
it s all you can do 
happens to everybody 
then you draw the black bean 
maybe the victim looks like a kid
you picked on in school
or the green eyes
remind you of your old lady 
or maybe it s something else 
but whatever it is 
they re your lifelong responsibility 
jimmy 
you own them 
you own them 
they re wherever they are 
and you are their angel 
trying like hell to turn the ledger
from red to black 
word to the wise  jimmy 
stay out of the angel business 
hey 
what is it you re looking for
in all of this 
to finish the job 
just like you 
it s not the same boy 
guys that kill pros
are a different breed
than the ones
that go after solid citizens 
yeah  nobody s that good
out of the block 
this boy practiced his trade
somewhere before 
well  it can t be the same guy 
he s a shark  remember 
he stops  he dies 
who said he stopped 
maybe he just took his show on the road 
i m over here on the right 
two of the five appliance
store employees have records 
one s 55  the other one s in his
late thirties  lives in hollywood 
both simple assaults 
it looks like a wash to me 
but you got all the info there 
and for the record  your hunch 
i don t think it holds water 
then why all the interest 
you wanna clear your conscience 
that s your problem 
but you gotta solve my case
to solve yours  who am i to moan 
but you piss on my leg
and call it rain  we re through 
hey  uh  what was julie s last supper 
it was roast beef  why 
it s the little things
that are important  jimmy 
it s the little things
that get you caught 
can i help you 
i saw the  for sale  sign 
that was for another car 
got a lot of miles on it 
you a    you a salesman 
no 
how s the trunk space 
it s standard 
mind if i take a look 
i m in the market 
it s not for sale 
all i need to do is take a look 
you must really like my car 
i do 
hey  sal  listen 
run a dmv check
on an albert leonard sparma 
yeah  see if he s sold any cars
in the last few months 
inconclusive 
but there are some similarities
to both brock and ewing 
partial of an incisor on ewing s cheek 
what about brock 
partial of a bicuspid 
 something else 
 what s that 
he s from back east 
folds his slice 
 we ll canvass over here 
 all right 
here we are
here we are alone
moon is shining

for changing jobs 
picking up 
leaving at a moment s notice
