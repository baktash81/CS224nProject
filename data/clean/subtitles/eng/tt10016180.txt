mary roberts paige callahan
tamara ewing
i only asked for roberts
yeah well
all the victims were hookers
they were all found drugged
and stabbed to death
on the same night in the same location
you gotta be kidding me
yeah im hilarious
i never figured you to be so hip
yeah they must have
must have changed owners
you want something to drink
dont worry i wont tell
where are you from originally
the valley
where are you from
originally
mississippi valley
alabama birmingham
well heres to being from somewhere
cheers
cheers
all right last nights victims
so we got six now
one julie brock never left home
three from the north county
bodies dumped here
two from here
bodies dumped in north county
and who said busing doesnt work
all knifed all gagged all bound
all very organized killings
not a lot of wasted motion
so i got a question why
why what
first geography
yep guys a shark
if he stops he dies
he likes to drive
probably has a decent car
maybe two high mileage
cant find one
in the neighborhood a victim
then uh he goes
wherever opportunity knocks
all right next why why the
extreme torture then the love bites
turns him on
no rape no sodomy
no genital mutilation hm
he kills for sexual pleasure
was stan peters our boy
god i hope not
all right back to the living our boy
hes got balls
ill give him that
he goes back to julies house
a few days after he kills her
moves her body shaves her legs
poses her he brings beer
milk food
just threw himself a little party
and they found partially digested meat
in her stomach
but she was a vegan strict vegetarian
shed never touch it
same as ana no way
not even with a knife to her throat
nobody wants to eat alone
mm
one last why
why are you trying to solve
a fiveyearold case
that everyone else has forgotten about
farris and i were
a couple of miles away
we heard a call over the radio
screams reported
sal was first one on the scene
no lights
switching problem guy from edison
said it happens once every decade or so
now you see the woman behind me
over my left shoulder
yeah
gladys fulcher spinster
sort of eyes and ears
of the neighborhood
a pain in the ass to the cops
but a godsend to a detective
and what did
good old gladys have to say
said she was out she lied about it
at first out of sheer embarrassment
but she came clean
what was she embarrassed about
she went on her first date in 15 years
slept at the old guys house
so the night of the hat trick
we had no lights
gladys getting boned
twomilliontoone long shot
crossing the finish line
in a dead heat
third strike
drought
no water no mud no prints
ground was hard like cement
victims were placed on that rock
right there
they were drugged elsewhere but they
were brought here stabbed to death
posed facing each other
bags over their heads laid down
like the rock was a table like a
tea party
where the guests fell asleep
warm this just went down
and where was your third victim
close by
you work the evidence
you still come up with zeros
its all you can do
happens to everybody
then you draw the black bean
maybe the victim looks like a kid
you picked on in school
or the green eyes
remind you of your old lady
or maybe its something else
but whatever it is
theyre your lifelong responsibility
jimmy
you own them
you own them
theyre wherever they are
and you are their angel
trying like hell to turn the ledger
from red to black
word to the wise jimmy
stay out of the angel business
hey
what is it youre looking for
in all of this
to finish the job
just like you
its not the same boy
guys that kill pros
are a different breed
than the ones
that go after solid citizens
yeah nobodys that good
out of the block
this boy practiced his trade
somewhere before
well it cant be the same guy
hes a shark remember
he stops he dies
who said he stopped
maybe he just took his show on the road
im over here on the right
two of the five appliance
store employees have records
ones 55 the other ones in his
late thirties lives in hollywood
both simple assaults
it looks like a wash to me
but you got all the info there
and for the record your hunch
i dont think it holds water
then why all the interest
you wanna clear your conscience
thats your problem
but you gotta solve my case
to solve yours who am i to moan
but you piss on my leg
and call it rain were through
hey uh what was julies last supper
it was roast beef why
its the little things
that are important jimmy
its the little things
that get you caught
can i help you
i saw the for sale sign
that was for another car
got a lot of miles on it
you a you a salesman
no
hows the trunk space
its standard
mind if i take a look
im in the market

all i need to do is take a look
you must really like my car
i do
hey sal listen
run a dmv check
on an albert leonard sparma
yeah see if hes sold any cars
in the last few months
inconclusive
but there are some similarities
to both brock and ewing
