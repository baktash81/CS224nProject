dominic s the dim one
on the island  isn t he 
he is  aye  by miles

forgive me  father  for i have sinned 
it s eight weeks
since my last confession  i think 
go on  colm 
just the usual  i suppose  father 
the drinking and the impure thoughts 
and a bit of pride  i suppose 
although i never really saw that as a sin 
but sure i m here now 
and   
how s the despair 
not so much of it of late 
thanks be 
and why aren t you talking
to pádraic súilleabháin no more 
that wouldn t be a sin  now 
would it  father 
it wouldn t be a sin  no 
but it s not very nice either  is it 
who told you 
it s an island  colm  word gets around 
also  pádraic asked me
to put in a word  like 
i see 
so   
it isn t him
you have the impure thoughts about  is it 
are you joking me 
i mean  are you fecking joking me 
people do have impure thoughts
about men  too 
do you have impure thoughts
about men  father 
i do not have impure thoughts about men 
and how dare you say that
about a man of the cloth 
well  you started it 
well  you can get out of my confessional
right now  so you can 
and i m not forgiving you any of these
things until the next time  so i m not 
well  i better not be dying
in the meantime then  eh  father 
i ll be pure fucked 
you will be pure fucked 
yes  you will be pure fucked 
pint  colm 
if you don t stop talkin  to me 
and if you don t stop botherin  me   
or sendin  your sister or your priest
to bother me   
i didn t send me sister
to bother you  did i 
she has her own mind 
although  i did send the priest though 
you have me there 
what i ve decided to do is this 
i have a set of shears at home 
and each time you bother me
from this day on   
i ll take those shears   
and i ll take one of me fingers off
with them 
and i ll give that finger to ya 
a finger from me left hand  me fiddle hand 
and each day you bother me more   
another i ll take off and i ll give ya   
until you see sense enough to stop 
or until i have no fingers left 
does this make things clearer to ya 
not really  no 
because i don t want
to hurt your feelings  pádraic 
i don t  like 
but it feels like the drastic
is the only option left open to me 
you ve loads of options left open to ya 
how s fingers the first port of call 
please  don t talk to me   
no more  pádraic 
please 
  i m begging you 
  but   
shush  like  pádraic 
  just  you know  shush  like 
  yeah  i d shush  like 
i will shush 
except me and me sister were thinking
you might just be a bit depressed  colm 
and i tell you this much 
fingers just confirms it 
don t you think  colm 
starting from now 
well  i never heard the like 
i never heard the like 
he must really not like you  pádraic 
fingers 
jesus  he s serious  lads 
he is serious 
you can see it in his eyes he s serious 
just because he thinks you re dull 
that s going overboard 
who told you about the dull 
well  i overheard it 
like  what was i supposed to do 
i don t think you re dull 
and jeez 
if i was to cut something off meself   
for every dull person that came in here 
i d only have me head left 
do you think i m dull  gerry 
no 
that said   
i did think the two of ye
always made a funny pairing  like 
  no  we didn t 
  yeah  ye did 
ye did  obviously  ye did 
 cause now he d rather maim himself
than talk to ya 
colm was always more of a thinker 
why s every   
i think 
you don t  pádraic 
  you don t  pádraic 
  your sister does 
  your sister does  aye  siobhán does 
  you re more of a   
you re more of a   
what is he 
you re more one of life s good guys 
you re more one of life s good guys  aye 
apart from when you re drunk 
apart from when you re drunk  aye 
i used to think that d

where are we now  france 
will you tell him  pádraic 
aye  stop being
a little fecking bollocks  dominic 
no  just about the mouth thing 
colm doherty and his fat fecking fingers 
he probably wouldn t even be able
to cut through the blubber on them fingers 
would you not want him to have to do the
one finger to see if he was bluffing  like 
no  we wouldn t 
that s what i d have him do  i d have him
do the one finger to see if he was bluffin  
 cause worst comes to worst   
he can still play the fiddle
with four fingers  i ll bet ya 
or the banjo 
we don t want any of that  we just
want nothing to do with him no more 
you don t

  knew it 
and paintings last  and poetry lasts 
so does niceness 
do you know who we remember   
for how nice they was in the 17th century 
  who 
  absolutely no one 
yet we all remember the music of the time 
everyone  to a man  knows mozart s name 
well  i don t  so there goes that theory 
and anyway  we re talkin  about niceness 
not whatsisname 
my mammy  she was nice 
i remember her 
and my daddy  he was nice 
i remember him 
and my sister  she s nice 
i ll remember her 
forever i ll remember her 
  and who else will 
   who else will  what 
remember siobhán and your niceness 
no one will 
in 50 years  time   
no one will remember any of us 
yet the music of a man
who lived two centuries ago   
 yet  he says  like he s english 
come home  pádraic 
i don t give a feck about mozart   
or borvoven   
or any of them funny name feckers 
i m pádraic súilleabháin 
and i m nice 
come home 
so you d rather be friends
with this fella  would ya 
a fella who   
beats his own son black and blue every
night that he s not fiddling with him 
i never told him that  daddy 
he s just drunk now 
you used to be nice 
or did you never used to be 
oh  god 
maybe you never used to be 
i ll have a word with him  colm 
you don t need to do anything drastic 
he won t be botherin  you no more 
that s a shame 
that s the most interesting he s ever been 
i think i like him again now 
it was the 18th century  anyway 
mozart 
not the 17th

sent him packing from the island 
did ya  how 
i told him a bread van
crashed into his daddy   
and he d have to be rushing home to him 
lest he die 
that sounds like the meanest thing
i ve ever heard 
well  aye  it was a bit mean  but   
he ll be fine once he gets home and he finds
his daddy hasn t been hit by a bread van 
i used to think you
were the nicest of them

you almost gave me a fecking heart attack 
i wasn t creeping up on ya 
i was sidling up on ya 
between you and that ghoul  jesus 
i always call her a ghoul  too 
because she is a ghoul 
jeez  we have a lot in common  don t we 
me and you 
calling old people ghouls and that 
it s a great old lake  isn t it 
i m glad i caught you  actually 
because there was somethin 
i was wantin  to ask ya  actually 
and discovering how much
we have in common   
well  it just makes me
want to ask you even more 
we don t have anything in common 
don t skip ahead 
but yeah  what i was wantin 
to ask you was   
somethin  along the lines of   
should ve planned this  really 
well  yeah 
what i was wantin  to ask you was   
you probably wouldn t ever want to 
i don t know   
to fall in love with a
boy like me  would ya 
dominic  i don t think so  love 
no  yeah  no  i was thinking no 
not even in the future  like 
like when i m your age 
yeah  no  i didn t think so 
just thought i d ask on the off chance 
you know   
like   faint heart  and that 
well  there goes that dream 
well   
i best go over there and do whatever
that thing over there i was gonna do was 
i walked from mallow town
to aghadoe  aghadoe
i took his head from
the jail gate to aghadoe
come on  sammy  you have to dance too 
like an irish king he sleeps in aghadoe
how are you  fatty 
dancing with your dog  is it 
well  who else is gonna dance with ya 
your poor dog has no say in the matter 
and if you re too rude
to be offering me a seat   
i ll be taking one of me own accord 
now  how s that for an old hello 
have you gone fecking mental 
have i gone fecking mental

fecking mental  actually 
not only have i not gone fecking mental   
but i have ten fingers to prove
i ve not gone fecking mental 
how many fingers do you have to prove

nine fingers 
and nine fingers is the epitome of mental 
that s right  the epitome 
there ll be none of that 
i didn t come here for licks 
i came here for the opposite of licks 
what s the opposite of licks

i know  i just like the double s h  sounds 
aye 
there s plenty of double s h  on inisherin 
yeah 
maybe there are banshees  too 
i just don t think that they scream
to portend death anymore 
i think they just sit back  amused 
and observe 
portend 
yeah 
i keep having thoughts
about playing it for you at your funeral 
but that wouldn t be fair on either of us 
would it 
well  that s great
that you finished your tune  colm

is that little gobshite of mine
at your place again 
leave him  peadar 
his donkey s just died 
did he 
the little miniature fella 
well  jesus  boys 
i ll tell ya this much   
two o clock 
i killed a miniature donkey 
it was by accident   
but i do feel bad about it 
do you think god gives a damn
about miniature donkeys  colm 
i fear he doesn t 
and i fear that s where
it s all gone wrong 
is that it 
is what it 
aren t you forgetting a couple of things 
no  i think i ve covered it 
wouldn t you say
punching a policeman is a sin 
ah here 
if punching a policeman is a sin   
we may as well just pack up and go home 
and self mutilation is a sin 
it s one of the biggest 
is it 
self mutilation  so you have me there 
multiplied by five 
how s the despair 
it s back a bit 
but you re not gonna do anything about it 
i m not gonna do anything about it  no 
dear pádraic   
i am safely ensconced in the mainland
and  pádraic  it s lovely here 
there s a river running past my window
as i write   
and the people already seem
less bitter and mental 
i m not sure why  but i think
it s  cause a lot of them are from spain 
mostly  i wanted to say
there s a spare bed here for you  pádraic 
and with the war almost over 
i think there d be work for ya here 
because there s nothing
for you on inisherin 
nothing but more bleakness and grudges   
and loneliness and spite   
and the slow passing of time until death 
and sure  you can do that anywhere 
so come  pádraic  leave there 
dominic can look after jenny
and the rest of your animals 
they could move into the house together 
so come now  pádraic  please 
before it s all too late 
dear siobhán 
obviously 
i don t know what  ensconced  is   
but i thank you for the offer of
the free bed and the whatnot 
but i won t be takin  you up on it 
i m afraid 
as i told you  me life is on inisherin 
  an8 me friends  me animals 
  an8 jenny
even now as i write   
little donkey jenny
is looking at me saying   
 please don t go  pádraic 
we d miss ya  
and nuzzling me  the gilly gooly 
get off  jenny 
in other news   
in sadder news  actually   
i won t be able to ask dominic anything 
i m afraid 
because they found him in the lake
this morning 
i suppose he must ve slipped
and fell in 
so  there d be no one
to take care of the animals  anyway 
no other news  really 
except that i love you  siobhán 
and i miss ya 
and i hope i ll see ya again someday 
if you ever come back home 
come back home  siobhán 
yours sincerely  your loving brother   
pádraic súilleabháin 
suppose me house makes us quits 
if you d stayed in your house 
that would ve made us quits 
but you didn t  did ya 
so it doesn t  does it 
i m sorry about your donkey  pádraic 
honestly  i am 
i don t fucking care 
haven t heard any rifle fire
from the mainland in a day or two 
i think they re coming to the end of it 
i m sure they ll be at it again
soon enough  aren t you 
some things there s no movin  on from
