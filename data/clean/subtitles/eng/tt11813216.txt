arent you forgetting a couple of things
no i think ive covered it
wouldnt you say
punching a policeman is a sin

if punching a policeman is a sin
we may as well just pack up and go home
and selfmutilation is a sin
its one of the biggest
is it
selfmutilation so you have me there
multiplied by five
hows the despair
its back a bit
but youre not gonna do anything about it
im not gonna do anything about it no
dear pádraic
i am safely ensconced in the mainland
and pádraic its lovely here
theres a river running past my window
as i write
and the people already seem
less bitter and mental
im not sure why but i think
its cause a lot of them are from spain
mostly i wanted to say
theres a spare bed here for you pádraic
and with the war almost over
i think thered be work for ya here
because theres nothing
for you on inisherin
nothing but more bleakness and grudges
and loneliness and spite
and the slow passing of time until death
and sure you can do that anywhere
so come pádraic leave there
dominic can look after jenny
and the rest of your animals
they could move into the house together
so come now pádraic please
before its all too late
dear siobhán
obviously
i dont know what ensconced is
but i thank you for the offer of
the free bed and the whatnot
but i wont be takin you up on it
im afraid
as i told you me life is on inisherin
an8me friends me animals
an8jenny
even now as i write
little donkey jenny
is looking at me saying
please dont go pádraic
wed miss ya
and nuzzling me the gillygooly
get off jenny
in other news
in sadder news actually
i wont be able to ask dominic anything
im afraid
because they found him in the lake
this morning
i suppose he mustve slipped
and fell in
so thered be no one
to take care of the animals anyway
no other news really
except that i love you siobhán
and i miss ya
and i hope ill see ya again someday
if you ever come back home
come back home siobhán
yours sincerely your loving brother
pádraic súilleabháin
suppose me house makes us quits
if youd stayed in your house
that wouldve made us quits
but you didnt did ya
so it doesnt does it
im sorry about your donkey pádraic
honestly i am
i dont fucking care
havent heard any rifle fire
from the mainland in a day or two
i think theyre coming to the end of it
im sure theyll be at it again
soon enough arent you
some things theres no movin on from
