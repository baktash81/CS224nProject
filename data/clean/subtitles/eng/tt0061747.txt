old enough to rustle cattle
you want them to hang
i just want them to get a fair
trial who do you want to hang
we all have our
ghosts marshal
you hunt your way
i hunt mine
all right you claim you
didnt pull the trigger
lets forget about
the killings
rustling is a hanging offense and
they are all guilty all three of them
no matter whose idea it was
theyre all guilty
thats the law
object
sustained
you sir
you will elicit facts
from the witness
i will tell the jury
whats the law
yes sir
no further questions
your honor
the jury will disregard all of the
prosecutions remarks concerning the law
all right son
you may step down now
call your next witness
marshal jedediah cooper
do you solemnly swear to tell the
truth the whole truth and nothing but
so help you god
i do
marshal at the time
of their apprehension
did any of these three
defendants deny their guilt
well no but on
the trail back here
marshal were not interested
in the trip back to fort grant
it was a heroic journey
the whole court the whole
territory is grateful
your honor i think something
that happened on the trail
back here has
a bearing on the case
something happen
that leads you to believe
that one or all three of
these defendants are innocent
well of murder yes you see
both ben and billyjoe told me
marshal this court is not
concerned with hearsay evidence
this court requires facts
the defendants all three are charged
with murder and rustling facts
the only matter that
concerns this court
i thought this court
was concerned with justice
justice is my province
marshal mine and mine alone
now youll confine yourself to giving
direct answers to direct questions
or find yourself in
contempt of court proceed
one of those boys is 18
the others only 16
thatll cost you 10 neither
one of thems been in trouble
20  with the law
if it wasnt for them
30 one more word youll
spend 30 days in the hole
do you have any further
questions for this witness
no more questions
your honor
then you may
step down marshal
yeah
sheriff ray calhoun
red creek
i recognize you
i wanna congratulate you on the job
you did bringing in those rustlers
you mean you rode all the way over
here from red creek bad back and all
just to tell me that
no
stones dead
what happened calhoun
it didnt make no sense him
sitting in that cell going crazy
in a town without
no blacksmith
he promised that if id
turn him loose every day
for a couple of hours
to work at his trade
that hed come back
to his cell each night
and he did came back
every night but one
i rode out to his home
a home where i had many a
dinner the home of a friend
i had to bring him back and
put him in his cell at gunpoint
he made a break for it
i tried to shoot low
but im not very good at that
i heard you paid 800 to the
skunk who murdered the johansons
and sold you their herd
thats right
how much did you get back
when they were caught
theres 800 in this
envelope its yours
or you can keep
the 100 head
prime every one of them
i dont have much use
for cattle these days
heres 10
keep it
hold it
heres 1140
for the aggravation
they caused me
now you take that bad back of
yours right over to red creek
and tell your friends
were even moneywise
so
its no deal
he figures you still
owe him for a lynching
and i told you you never
shouldve offered him the money
all right
now that makes three
mistakes we made
the money
we hung an innocent man
and we didnt
finish the job
we cant undo
the first two
but we can still
finish the job
i didnt hear that

meditate day and night
and he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water
that bringeth forth
his fruit in his season
his leaf shall not wither
and whatever he doeth
shall prosper

this fleeting breath
when mine eyes
shall close in death
when i rise to worlds unknown
and behold thee on thy throne
rock of ages
cleft for me

im sorry
whats the matter
i was married
back in denver
his name was paul
he was a doctor
and a very fine man
he used to say
this was his place
this was where
doctors were needed
one night after wed camped
we sat around
the fire talking
husband and wife talk
about how many children
we were going to have
and what a wonderful life we
were going to have together
and then they came
two men on horseback
just some food
just to share our food
thats all they wanted
and one of them
put his hand on me
and there was a shot
and paul was dead
and they just left him there lying
beside me on the ground dead
and they took me
and took me
and took me
the tumbleweed wagon
the jail youre
looking for those men
and what happens
when you find them
or if you dont find them
ever
wed better hurry
its gonna storm
miss rachel where do you
want to put these blankets
what is it marvin
where do you
want these blankets
just put them
in the back someplace
yes maam
hi marshal
you asked me once whether
i could ever stop looking
i think now i can
can you
well rachel
theres a difference
you see im not
im not looking for ghosts
the end of my trails
in red creek
maybe not
what then
i dont know
think we got him
i dont know
the dog or the shot
either one
why aint that
dog yapping
if that marshal was alive that
dog would be yapping wouldnt he
i told you i didnt know
but i aim
to find out
no let him come to us
no captain ive waited
on him long enough
why dont he move
tommy
drop it
dead captain wilson tommy
loomis all of them dead
all except maddow blackfoot
and you jenkins
count me dead too
i just want to say that
i dont hold you to blame
for what thats worth
its worth something
so thats how it is
that rachel lit a fire in you
with that rich body of hers
you lit a fire
in each other
now youre going to get married
and raise cattle and kids
devil take
the rest of the world
maybe
you used the law and a badge
to heal that scar on your neck
well how many men are you going
to have to hang to heal your scar
go to hell cooper
ive already been
there judge
in your wagon and in
that hole you call a jail
and old man jenkins
is gonna die there
is he sick
hes dying
ill get a doctor
down there for him
let him go
so he can go on and look for
another innocent man to lynch
hes an old man
well
and that was an old rope he
helped put around your neck
but it came damn near
to killing you didnt it
whats the matter
with you cooper
you got jenkins
on your conscience
think i judged him
too harshly
used him like a piece of
kindling for my fire of justice
well maybe thats inevitable when
theres only one man one court
with the power
of final justice
over a territory five times
the size of most states
mistakes ive made them
cooper dont you doubt it
dont you doubt either there are times
sitting up there in that judgment seat
ive wished i have prayed
that there was someone standing
between me and god almighty
someone with
the power to say
youre wrong fenton
you made a mistake in law
this man here
deserves another trial
this man here a reprieve
and this man is innocent
but until this territory
becomes a state
with a governor and a
state court of appeals
im the law here
all the law
and if you dont like that you
can cuss me till hell freezes over
or you can join me cooper
even fight me
help me turn this godforsaken
territory into a state
where no one man
calls himself the law
i want that old
man pardoned
you pick up your badge
tonight right now
you take this down
give it to one of
the guards down there
if there are any questions
you tell them to see me
therell be no questions
cooper
