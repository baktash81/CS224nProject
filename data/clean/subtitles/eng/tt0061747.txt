three new prisoners

warren down to the cell block 
two of them are just boys 
old enough to rustle cattle 
you want them to hang 
i just want them to get a fair
trial  who do you want to hang 
we all have our
ghosts  marshal 
you hunt your way 
i hunt mine 
all right  you claim you
didn t pull the trigger 
let s forget about
the killings 
rustling is a hanging offense  and
they are all guilty  all three of them 
no matter whose idea it was 
they re all guilty 
that s the law 
object 
sustained 
you  sir 
you will elicit facts
from the witness 
i will tell the jury
what s the law 
yes  sir 
no further questions 
your honor 
the jury will disregard all of the
prosecution s remarks concerning the law 
all right  son 
you may step down now 
call your next witness 
marshal jedediah cooper 
do you solemnly swear to tell the
truth  the whole truth and nothing but 
so help you god 
i do 
marshal  at the time
of their apprehension 
did any of these three
defendants deny their guilt 
well  no  but on
the trail back here   
marshal  we re not interested
in the trip back to fort grant 
it was a heroic journey 
the whole court  the whole
territory  is grateful 
your honor  i think something
that happened on the trail
back here has
a bearing on the case 
something happen
that leads you to believe
that one or all three of
these defendants are innocent 
well  of murder  yes  you see 
both ben and billy joe told me   
marshal  this court is not
concerned with hearsay evidence 
this court requires facts 
the defendants  all three  are charged
with murder and rustling  facts 
the only matter that
concerns this court 
i thought this court
was concerned with justice 
justice is my province 
marshal  mine  and mine alone 
now  you ll confine yourself to giving
direct answers to direct questions
or find yourself in
contempt of court  proceed 
one of those boys is 18 
the other s only 16 
that ll cost you  10  neither
one of them s been in trouble   
 20      with the law 
if it wasn t for them   
 30  one more word  you ll
spend 30 days in the hole 
do you have any further
questions for this witness 
no more questions 
your honor 
then you may
step down  marshal 
yeah 
sheriff ray calhoun 
red creek 
i recognize you 
i wanna congratulate you on the job
you did bringing in those rustlers 
you mean  you rode all the way over
here from red creek  bad back and all 
just to tell me that 
no 
stone s dead 
what happened  calhoun 
it didn t make no sense  him
sitting in that cell going crazy
in a town without
no blacksmith 
he promised that if i d
turn him loose every day
for a couple of hours
to work at his trade
that he d come back
to his cell each night 
and he did  came back
every night but one 
i rode out to his home 
a home where i had many a
dinner  the home of a friend 
i had to bring him back and
put him in his cell at gunpoint 
he made a break for it 
i tried to shoot low 
but i m not very good at that 
i heard you paid 800 to the
skunk who murdered the johansons
and sold you their herd 
that s right 
how much did you get back
when they were caught 
 11 40 
there s 800 in this
envelope  it s yours 
or you can keep
the 100 head 
prime  every one of them 
i don t have much use
for cattle these days 
here s 10 
keep it 
hold it 
here s  11 40
for the aggravation
they caused me 
now  you take that bad back of
yours right over to red creek
and tell your friends
we re even  money wise 
so 
it s no deal 
he figures you still
owe him for a lynching 
and i told you  you never
should ve offered him the money 
all right 
now that makes three
mistakes we made 
the money 
we hung an innocent man 
and we didn t
finish the job 
we can t undo
the first two 
but we can still
finish the job 
i didn t hear that 
captain wilson 
i didn t hear none of it 
i m riding back to red creek 
are you coming with me 
charlie  you ve been with me
better than five years 
good years  captain 
maybe if it was my land
i was fighting to hold   
no  captain  if that marshal wants charlie
blackfoot  he s gonna have to find him 
sorry  captain wilson 
maddow  you re
damn near my age 
you wouldn t last
six months in that jail 
i don t intend to try to 
i can still ride
pretty good 
you can shoot
even better 
i m sorry  captain 
maddow  he ll
come after you 
he ll keep coming  you ll
be nothing but an animal 
an animal running scared 
sorry  captain 
how about you two  you sure 
tommy

now  preacher 
patience  patience 
 blessed is the man that walketh
not in the counsel of the ungodly 
 nor standeth in
the way of sinners 
 nor sitteth in the
seat of the scornful 
 but his delight is in
the law of the lord 
 and in his law doth he
meditate day and night 
 and he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water
 that bringeth forth
his fruit in his season 
 his leaf shall not wither 
 and whatever he doeth
shall prosper   
amen 
we will now sing
rock of ages 
get your cold beer and your sarsaparilla
for all the kids  right here 
rock of ages
cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee
let the water and the blood
from thy wounded
side which flowed
be of sin the double cure
save from wrath
and make me pure
while i draw
this fleeting breath
when mine eyes
shall close in death
when i rise to worlds unknown
and behold thee on thy throne
rock of ages
cleft for me
let me hide myself in thee

you inside that bottle of whiskey 
waiting for you to take

do you have
last requests 
   waiting to get down

evil thing in this here world 
it destroyed good
men like myself 
it ll destroy you  too 
do you have
last requests

got no more cause to lie 
 cause he s going
to meet his maker 
and now he s ready 
well  that s all
i ve got to say 
will you all bow your heads
in one final prayer 
may god have mercy
on their poor souls 
as he has upon
all the faithful departed

just thanks 
you re welcome 
i ll get some
salt for the eggs 
forget the salt 
please 
please don t 
yeah  well  i guess   
i guess my life isn t
worth two kisses  huh 
please 
i m sorry 
what s the matter 
i was married 
back in denver 
his name was paul 
he was a doctor
and a very fine man 
he used to say
this was his place 
this was where
doctors were needed 
one night  after we d camped 
we sat around
the fire  talking 
husband and wife talk
about how many children
we were going to have 
and what a wonderful life we
were going to have together 
and then they came 
two men on horseback 
just some food 
just to share our food 
that s all they wanted 
and one of them
put his hand on me 
and there was a shot 
and paul was dead 
and they just left him there lying
beside me on the ground  dead 
and they took me 
and took me 
and took me 
the tumbleweed wagon 
the jail  you re
looking for those men 
and what happens
when you find them 
or if you don t find them 
ever 
we d better hurry 
it s gonna storm 
miss rachel  where do you
want to put these blankets 
what is it  marvin 
where do you
want these blankets 
just put them
in the back someplace 
yes  ma am 
hi  marshal 
you asked me once whether
i could ever stop looking 
i think now i can 
can you 
well  rachel 
there s a difference 
you see  i m not   
i m not looking for ghosts 
the end of my trail s
in red creek 
maybe not 
what then 
i don t know 
think we got him 
i don t know 
the dog or the shot 
either one 
why ain t that
dog yapping 
if that marshal was alive that
dog would be yapping  wouldn t he 
i told you i didn t know 
but i aim
to find out 
no  let him come to us 
no  captain  i ve waited
on him long enough 
why don t he move 
tommy 
drop it 
dead  captain wilson  tommy 
loomis  all of them  dead 
all except maddow  blackfoot 
and you  jenkins 
count me dead  too 
i just want to say that
i don t hold you to blame 
for what that s worth 
it s worth something 
so that s how it is 
that rachel lit a fire in you
with that rich body of hers 
you lit a fire
in each other 
now you re going to get married
and raise cattle and kids 
devil take
the rest of the world 
maybe 
you used the law and a badge
to heal that scar on your neck 
well  how many men are you going
to have to hang to heal your scar 
go to hell  cooper 
i ve already been
there  judge 
in your wagon and in
that hole you call a jail 
and old man jenkins
is gonna die there 
is he sick 
he s dying 
i ll get a doctor
down there for him 
let him go 
so he can go on and look for
another innocent man to lynch 
he s an old man 
well 
and that was an old rope he
helped put around your neck 
but it came damn near
to killing you  didn t it 
what s the matter
with you  cooper 
you got jenkins
on your conscience 
think i judged him
too harshly 
used him like a piece of
kindling for my fire of justice 
well  maybe that s inevitable when
there s only one man  one court
with the power
of final justice
over a territory five times
the size of most states 
mistakes  i ve made them 
cooper  don t you doubt it 
don t you doubt either there are times
sitting up there in that judgment seat
i ve wished  i have prayed
that there was someone standing
between me and god almighty 
someone with
the power to say 
 you re wrong  fenton 
you made a mistake in law 
 this man here
deserves another trial 
 this man here a reprieve 
and this man is innocent  
but until this territory
becomes a state 
with a governor and a
state court of appeals 
i m the law here 
all the law 
and if you don t like that  you
can cuss me till hell freezes over 
or you can join me  cooper 
even fight me 
help me turn this godforsaken
territory into a state
where no one man
calls himself the law 
i want that old
man pardoned 
you pick up your badge 
tonight  right now 
you take this down 
give it to one of
the guards down there 
if there are any questions 
you tell them to see me 
there ll be no questions
