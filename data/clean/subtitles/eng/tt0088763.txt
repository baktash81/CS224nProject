when i was your age
i never chased a boy or called a boy or
sat in a parked car with a boy
linda then how am i ever
supposed to meet anybody
well itll just happen
like the way i met your father
that was so stupid
grandpa hit him with the car
it was meant to be
anyway
if grandpa hadnt hit him
then none of you would have been born
yeah well
i dont understand what dad was doing
in the middle of the street
mrs mcfly
what was it george birdwatching
what lorraine what
anyway your grandpa
hit him with the car
and brought him into the house
he seemed so helpless
like a little lost puppy
and my heart just went out to him
linda yeah we know
youve told us this story a million times
you felt sorry for him
you decided to go with him
to the fish under the sea dance
no it was
the enchantment under the sea dance
our first date ill never forget it
it was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm remember george
your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor
it was then that i realized
that i was going to spend
the rest of my life with him
oh no
hello
doc marty you didnt fall asleep did you
marty doc

i forgot my video camera
can you pick it up at my place
on your way to the mall
yeah im on my way
einstein wheres the doc boy
doc
marty you made it
yeah
welcome to my latest experiment this is
the one ive been waiting for all my life
well its a delorean
all your questions will be answered
roll tape and well proceed
is that a devo suit
never mind that now
doc not now
marty im ready
good evening im dr emmett brown
im in the twin pines mall parking lot
its saturday morning
october 26 1985 118 am
this is temporal experiment number one
doc come on einie get in there
in you go sit down
put your seat belt on
marty okay
please note that einsteins clock
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch
doc got it
marty right check doc
doc have a good trip einstein
watch your head
marty
you got that thing hooked up to the car
doc watch this
marty yeah okay
marty got it
jesus
not me the car
if my calculations are correct
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour
youre going to see some serious shit
watch this
what did i tell you
88 miles per hour
the temporal displacement occurred
exactly 120 am and zero seconds
jesus christ
jesus christ doc
you disintegrated einstein
calm down i didnt disintegrate anything
the molecular structure of both einstein
and the car are completely intact
then where the hell are they
the appropriate question is
when the hell are they
einstein has just become
the worlds first time traveler
doc i sent him into the future
one minute into the future to be exact
at precisely 121 am and zero seconds
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine
wait a minute doc
are you telling me that
you built a time machine
out of a delorean
the way i see it
if youre going to build a time machine
into a car why not do it with style
besides the stainlesssteel construction
made the flux dispersal
look out
marty what is it hot
doc its cold damn cold
einstein you little devil
einsteins clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking
marty hes okay
doc hes fine
hes completely unaware
that anything happened
as far as hes concerned
the trip was instantaneous
thats why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine
he skipped over that minute to
instantly arrive at this moment in time
ill show you how it works
first you turn the time circuits on
doc this tells you where youre going
this where you are and this where you were
input your destination time on this keypad
say you want to see the signing
of the declaration of independence
doc or witness the birth of christ
heres a redletter date
in the history of science
november 5 1955
yes of course
november 5 1955
what happened
that was the day i invented time travel
i remember it vividly
i was standing on my toilet
hanging a clock
the porcelain was wet
i slipped hit my head on the sink
when i came to i had a revelation
a vision a picture in my head
a picture of this
this is what makes time travel possible
the flux capacitor
flux capacitor
its taken almost 30 years and my family
fortune to realize the vision of that day
my god has it been that long
things have certainly changed around here
i remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see
old man peabody owned all of this
he had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees
this is
this is heavyduty doc this is great
does it run on regular unleaded gasoline
unfortunately no it requires something
with a little more kick plutonium
plutonium wait a minute
are you telling me
that this sucker is nuclear
keep rolling there
no this suckers electrical
but i need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 121 gigawatts of electricity i need
you dont just walk into a store
and buy plutonium
did you rip that off
of course from a group of libyans
they wanted me to build them a bomb
i took the plutonium and gave them a
bomb casing full of pinball machine parts
doc come on lets get you a radiation suit
marty jesus
its safe now everythings leadlined
doc dont lose those tapes now
i need that as a record
lets put this back here there we go
almost forgot my luggage

cotton underwear in the future

im from the future
i came here in a time machine
that you invented
now i need your help
to get back to the year 1985
my god
do you know what this means
it means that
this damn thing doesnt work at all
marty you got to help me you are the only
one who knows how your time machine works
time machine
i havent invented any time machine
okay ill prove it to you
look at my drivers license expires 1987
look at my birthday
i havent even been born yet
and look at this picture
its my brother my sister and me
look at her sweatshirt doc
class of 1984
doc pretty mediocre photographic fakery
they cut off your brothers hair
im telling the truth
you got to believe me
then tell me future boy
whos president of the united states
in 1985
ronald reagan
ronald reagan the actor
then whos vice president jerry lewis
doc i suppose jane wyman is the first lady
marty wait doc
doc and jack benny is treasury secretary
marty listen to me
ive had enough jokes for one evening
good night future boy
marty no wait doc
marty the bruise on your head
i know how that happened you told me
you were standing on your toilet
hanging a clock
and you fell
and hit your head on the sink
thats when you got the idea
for the flux capacitor which
is what makes time travel possible
marty theres something wrong with
the starter so i hid it here
doc after i fell off my toilet
i drew this
marty the flux capacitor
it works
it works
i finally invent something that works
you bet your ass it works
weve got to sneak this back
to my laboratory
weve got to get you home
this is it
doc on tv
never mind that now
doc why thats me look at me
im an old man
im dr emmett brown
im in the twin pines mall parking lot
thank god ive still got my hair
whats this thing im wearing
this is a radiation suit
radiation suit
of course cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars
this is truly amazing
a portable television studio
no wonder your president has to be
an actor he has to look good on tv
marty this is the part coming up
this suckers electrical but i need a nuclear
reaction to generate the 121 gigawatts
what did i just say
this suckers electrical
but i need a nuclear reaction
to generate the 121 gigawatts of
121 gigawatts
121 gigawatts
doc great scott
what the hell is a gigawatt
how could i have been so careless
121 gigawatts
tom how am i going to generate
that kind of power
it cant be done can it
marty doc look
all we need is a little plutonium
doc im sure that in 1985 plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore
but in 1955 its a little hard to come by
marty im sorry
but im afraid youre stuck here
doc stuck here i cant be stuck here
i got a life in 1985
i got a girl
is she pretty
doc shes beautiful
shes crazy about me look at this
look what she wrote here
that says it all
doc youre my only hope
marty im sorry but the only power source
capable of generating
121 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning
marty what did you say
doc a bolt of lightning
unfortunately you never know
when or where its ever going to strike
we do now
this is it
this is the answer
it says here that a bolt of lightning
is going to strike the clock tower
at 1004 pm next saturday night
if we could somehow harness
this lightning
channel it into the flux capacitor
it just might work
next saturday night
were sending you back to the future
all right saturdays good
i can spend a week in 1955
i can hang out you can show me around
that is out of the question
you must not leave this house
you must not see or talk to anybody
anything you do can have repercussions
on future events do you understand
yeah sure okay
marty
have you interacted with anybody else
today besides me
yeah well i mightve sort of
bumped into my parents
great scott let me see that photograph
again of your brother
just as i thought this proves my theory
look at your brother
marty
his heads gone its like its been erased
erased from existence
they really cleaned this place up
looks brandnew
doc according to my theory you interfered
with your parents first meeting
if they dont meet they wont fall in love
get married or have kids
thats why your brothers disappearing
your sister will follow and unless
you repair the damage youre next
marty sounds heavy
doc weight has nothing to do with it
which ones your pop
thats him
okay okay you guys
very funny
you guys are being real mature
maybe you were adopted
george okay real mature guys
george okay pick up my books
strickland mcfly
thats strickland
jesus didnt that guy ever have hair
shape up man youre a slacker
do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life
no
what did your mother see in him
i dont know
i guess she felt sorry for him
cause her dad hit him with the car
he hit me with the car
thats the florence nightingale effect
it happens in hospitals when
nurses fall in love with their patients
go to it kid
george buddy
i have been looking all over for you
you remember me
the guy who saved your life the other day
yeah
theres somebody id like you to meet
lorraine
calvin
id like you to meet
my good friend george mcfly
hi its really a pleasure to meet you
hows your head
good fine
ive been worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night
are you okay
im sorry i have to go
come on
isnt he a dreamboat
she didnt even look at him
this is more serious than i thought
your mother is infatuated with you
instead of your father
wait a minute doc
are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me
precisely
this is heavy
theres that word again heavy
why are things so heavy in the future
is there a problem with the earths gravity
the only way were going to
get them to mate is if theyre alone
youve got to get them to interact
in some sort of social
you mean like a date
right
what kind of date
what do kids do in the 50s
theyre your parents
you must know them
what are their common interests
what do they like to do together
nothing
doc look theres a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up
the enchantment under the sea dance
theyre supposed to go to this
thats where they kiss for the first time
all right kid
you stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes her to that dance
marty george buddy
remember that girl
i introduced you to lorraine
what are you writing
stories
mr mcfly science fiction stories
about visitors
coming down to earth
from other planets
get out of town
i didnt know you did anything creative
let me read some
no no
i never let anybody read my stories
marty why not
what if they didnt like them
what if they told me i was no good
i guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand
no no not hard at all
so anyway george about lorraine
she really likes you
she told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her
to the enchantment
under the sea dance
really
yeah
all you got to do is go over there
and ask her
right here right now in the cafeteria
what if she said no i dont know
if i could take that kind of rejection
besides i think shed rather go
with somebody else
marty who
biff

you dont understand
i do
if i know too much
i endanger my own existence
just as youve endangered yours
youre right
let me show you my plan
for sending you home
please excuse the crudity of this model
i didnt have time to build it to scale
or paint it
its good
thank you
we run industrialstrength electrical cable
from the top of the clock tower
down suspending it over the street
between these two lampposts
meanwhile weve outfitted the time
vehicle with this big pole and hook
which runs directly
into the flux capacitor
at the calculated moment
you start off from down the street
driving directly toward the cable
accelerating to 88 miles per hour
according to the flyer at precisely
1004 pm this saturday night
lightning will strike the clock tower
electrifying the cable
as the connecting hook makes contact
thereby sending 121 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor
and sending you back to 1985
doc all right now watch this
you wind up the car and release it
ill simulate the lightning
ready
set
release
marty youre instilling me
with a lot of confidence
dont worry ill take care of ideas
you take care of your pop
by the way
what happened today did he ask her out
i think so
what did she say
its your mom shes tracked you down
quick lets cover the time machine
hi cal marty
marty lorraine
how did you know i was here
i followed you
this is my doc my uncle
doc brown
hi
hi
lorraine
marty this may seem a little forward
but i was kind of wondering
if youd ask me to the
enchantment under the sea dance
on saturday
you mean
you mean nobodys asked you
lorraine no
not yet
what about george
george mcfly
hes kind of cute and all but not
well
i think a man should be strong
so he can stand up for himself
and protect the woman he loves
dont you
yeah
i still dont understand
how am i supposed to
go to the dance with her
if shes already going
to the dance with you
well because george
she wants to go with you
she just doesnt know it yet
thats why we got to show her
that you george are a fighter
youre somebody who stands up
for yourself and will protect her
yeah but ive never picked a fight
in my entire life
look youre not going
to be picking a fight dad
daddaddaddyo
youre coming to her rescue right
lets go over the plan again
855 where are you going to be
im going to be at the dance
and where am i going to be
youll be in the car with her
right around 900
shes going to get very angry with me
why is she going to get angry with you
well because george nice girls get angry
when guys take advantage of them
youre going to go touch her on her
no no george look
its just an act right
so 900 youre strolling
through the parking lot
you see us struggling in the car
you walk up you open the door
and you say
your line george
hey you get your damn hands off her
you really think i ought to swear
definitely
goddamn it george swear
okay so now you come up
you punch me in the stomach
im out for the count right
and you and lorraine
live happily ever after
you make it sound so easy
i just i wish i wasnt so scared
theres nothing to be scared of
all it takes is selfconfidence
you know if you put your mind to it
you can accomplish anything
announcer
hill valley weather this saturday night
mostly clear with some scattered clouds
lows tonight in the upper forties
are you sure about this storm
since when can weathermen predict
the weather let alone the future
you know marty
im going to be very sad to see you go
youve made a difference in my life
given me something to shoot for
just knowing
that im going to be around to see 1985
that im going to succeed in this
that im going to have a chance
to travel through time
its going to be hard
waiting 30 years to talk to you
about everything thats happened
in the past few days
im really going to miss you marty
im going to miss you
doc about the future
no
weve agreed that information about
the future can be extremely dangerous
even if your intentions are good
it can backfire drastically
whatever youve got to tell me ill find out
through the natural course of time
dear dr brown
on the night that i go back in time
you will be
shot by terrorists
please take whatever precautions are
necessary to prevent this terrible disaster

lets send you back at exactly
the same time
itll be like you never left
now i painted a white line
on the street way over there
thats where youll start from
ive calculated the precise distance
taking into account
the acceleration speed
and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment the lightning strikes
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds
when this alarm goes off you hit the gas
right
well i guess thats everything
thanks
thank you
doc see you in about 30 years
i hope so
dont worry
as long as you hit that wire
with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour
the instant the lightning
strikes the tower
