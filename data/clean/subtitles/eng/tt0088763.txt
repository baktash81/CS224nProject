newscaster  the senate is expected
to vote on this today 
in other news  officials at
the pacific nuclear research facility   
    have denied the rumor
that a case of missing plutonium   
    was in fact stolen
from their vault two weeks ago 
a libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft 
however  officials now attribute
the discrepancy to a simple clerical error 
the fbi  which is investigating the matter 
had no comment

   jennifer parker called you twice 
mrs  mcfly  i don t like her 
any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble 
linda  mom  there s nothing wrong
with calling a boy 
i think it s terrible  girls chasing boys 
when i was your age 
i never chased a boy or called a boy or   
   sat in a parked car with a boy 
linda  then how am i ever
supposed to meet anybody 
well  it ll just happen 
like the way i met your father 
that was so stupid 
grandpa hit him with the car 
it was meant to be 
anyway   
   if grandpa hadn t hit him 
then none of you would have been born 
yeah  well 
i don t understand what dad was doing
in the middle of the street 
mrs  mcfly 
what was it  george  bird watching 
what  lorraine  what 
anyway  your grandpa
hit him with the car   
   and brought him into the house 
he seemed so helpless 
like a little lost puppy 
and my heart just went out to him 
linda  yeah  we know 
you ve told us this story a million times 
you felt sorry for him 
you decided to go with him
to the fish under the sea dance 
no  it was
the enchantment under the sea dance 
our first date  i ll never forget it 
it was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm  remember  george 
your father kissed me
for the first time on that dance floor 
it was then that i realized   
   that i was going to spend
the rest of my life with him 
oh  no 
hello 
doc  marty  you didn t fall asleep  did you 
marty  doc

yeah  i m on my way 
einstein  where s the doc  boy 
doc 
  marty  you made it 
  yeah 
welcome to my latest experiment  this is
the one i ve been waiting for all my life 
well  it s a delorean   
all your questions will be answered 
roll tape and we ll proceed 
  is that a devo suit 
  never mind that now 
doc  not now 
marty  i m ready 
good evening  i m dr  emmett brown 
i m in the twin pines mall parking lot 
it s saturday morning 
october 26  1985  1 18 a m 
this is temporal experiment number one 
doc  come on  einie  get in there 
in you go  sit down 
put your seat belt on 
marty  okay 
please note that einstein s clock   
   is in precise synchronization
with my control watch 
doc  got it 
marty  right  check  doc 
doc  have a good trip  einstein 
watch your head 
marty 
you got that thing hooked up to the car 
doc  watch this 
marty  yeah  okay 
marty  got it 
jesus 
not me  the car 
if my calculations are correct   
   when this baby hits 88 miles per hour   
   you re going to see some serious shit 
watch this 
what did i tell you 
88 miles per hour 
the temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1 20 a m  and zero seconds 
jesus christ 
jesus christ  doc 
you disintegrated einstein 
calm down  i didn t disintegrate anything 
the molecular structure of both einstein
and the car are completely intact 
then where the hell are they 
the appropriate question is 
 when the hell are they  
einstein has just become
the world s first time traveler 
doc  i sent him into the future 
one minute into the future  to be exact 
at precisely 1 21 a m  and zero seconds   
   we shall catch up with him
and the time machine 
wait a minute  doc 
are you telling me that
you built a time machine   
   out of a delorean 
  the way i see it   
   if you re going to build a time machine
into a car  why not do it with style 
besides  the stainless steel construction
made the flux dispersal   
look out 
marty  what  is it hot 
doc  it s cold  damn cold 
einstein  you little devil 
einstein s clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking 
marty  he s okay 
doc  he s fine 
he s completely unaware
that anything happened 
as far as he s concerned 
the trip was instantaneous 
that s why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine 
he skipped over that minute to
instantly arrive at this moment in time 
i ll show you how it works 
first  you turn the time circuits on 
doc  this tells you where you re going 
this where you are and this where you were 
input your destination time on this keypad 
say you want to see the signing
of the declaration of independence 
doc  or witness the birth of christ 
here s a red letter date
in the history of science 
november 5  1955 
yes  of course 
november 5  1955 
what happened 
that was the day i invented time travel 
i remember it vividly 
i was standing on my toilet
hanging a clock 
the porcelain was wet 
i slipped  hit my head on the sink 
when i came to  i had a revelation 
a vision  a picture in my head 
a picture of this 
this is what makes time travel possible 
the flux capacitor 
flux capacitor 
it s taken almost 30 years and my family
fortune to realize the vision of that day 
my god  has it been that long 
things have certainly changed around here 
i remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see 
old man peabody owned all of this 
he had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees 
this is   
this is heavy duty  doc  this is great 
does it run on regular unleaded gasoline 
unfortunately  no  it requires something
with a little more kick  plutonium 
plutonium  wait a minute 
are you telling me
that this sucker is nuclear 
keep rolling there 
no  this sucker s electrical   
   but i need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1 21 gigawatts of electricity i need 
you don t just walk into a store
and buy plutonium 
did you rip that off 
of course  from a group of libyans 
they wanted me to build them a bomb 
i took the plutonium and gave them a
bomb casing full of pinball machine parts 
doc  come on  let s get you a radiation suit 
marty  jesus 
it s safe now  everything s lead lined 
doc  don t lose those tapes now 
i need that as a record 
let s put this back here  there we go 
almost forgot my luggage 
who knows if they got
cotton underwear in the future 
  i m allergic to all synthetics 
  the future 
  that s where you re going 
  right 
25 years  i ve always dreamed of seeing
the future  looking beyond my years   
   seeing the progress of mankind 
marty  why not 
i ll also be able to see
who wins the next 25 world series 
marty  doc 
look me up when you get there 
indeed i will  roll  em 
i  dr  emmett brown   
   am about to embark
on an historic journey 
what am i thinking of 
i almost forgot to bring extra plutonium 
how do i expect to get back 
one pellet  one trip 
i must be out of my mind 
what is it 
my god 
they found me 
i don t know how  but they found me

quiet 
donations 
you want me to make a donation   
   to the coast guard youth auxiliary 
doc   
   i m from the future 
i came here in a time machine
that you invented 
now  i need your help
to get back to the year 1985 
my god 
do you know what this means 
it means that
this damn thing doesn t work at all 
marty  you got to help me  you are the only
one who knows how your time machine works 
time machine 
i haven t invented any time machine 
okay  i ll prove it to you 
look at my driver s license  expires 1987 
look at my birthday 
i haven t even been born yet 
and look at this picture 
it s my brother  my sister and me 
look at her sweatshirt  doc 
 class of 1984  
doc  pretty mediocre photographic fakery 
they cut off your brother s hair 
i m telling the truth 
you got to believe me 
then tell me  future boy   
   who s president of the united states
in 1985 
  ronald reagan 
  ronald reagan  the actor 
then who s vice president  jerry lewis 
doc  i suppose jane wyman is the first lady 
marty  wait  doc 
doc  and jack benny is treasury secretary 
marty  listen to me 
i ve had enough jokes for one evening 
good night  future boy 
marty  no  wait  doc 
marty  the bruise on your head 
i know how that happened  you told me 
you were standing on your toilet
hanging a clock   
   and you fell
and hit your head on the sink 
that s when you got the idea
for the flux capacitor which   
   is what makes time travel possible 
marty  there s something wrong with
the starter  so i hid it here 
doc  after i fell off my toilet   
    i drew this 
marty  the flux capacitor 
it works 
it works 
i finally invent something that works 
you bet your ass it works 
we ve got to sneak this back
to my laboratory 
we ve got to get you home 
this is it 
doc on tv 
never mind that now 
doc  why  that s me  look at me 
  i m an old man 
  i m dr  emmett brown 
i m in the twin pines mall parking lot 
thank god  i ve still got my hair 
what s this thing i m wearing 
this is a radiation suit 
radiation suit 
of course   cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars 
this is truly amazing 
a portable television studio 
no wonder your president has to be
an actor  he has to look good on tv 
marty  this is the part coming up 
this sucker s electrical but i need a nuclear
reaction to generate the 1 21 gigawatts   
what did i just say 
    this sucker s electrical 
but i need a nuclear reaction   
   to generate the 1 21 gigawatts of   
  1 21 gigawatts 
1 21 gigawatts 
doc  great scott 
what the hell is a gigawatt 
how could i have been so careless 
1 21 gigawatts 
tom  how am i going to generate
that kind of power 
it can t be done  can it 
marty  doc  look 
all we need is a little plutonium 
doc  i m sure that in 1985 plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore   
   but in 1955  it s a little hard to come by 
marty  i m sorry 
but i m afraid you re stuck here 
doc  stuck here  i can t be stuck here 
i got a life in 1985 
  i got a girl 
  is she pretty 
doc  she s beautiful 
she s crazy about me  look at this 
look what she wrote here 
that says it all 
doc  you re my only hope 
marty  i m sorry  but the only power source
capable of generating   
    1 21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning 
marty  what did you say 
doc  a bolt of lightning 
unfortunately  you never know
when or where it s ever going to strike 
we do now 
this is it 
this is the answer 
it says here that a bolt of lightning   
   is going to strike the clock tower
at 10 04 p m  next saturday night 
if we could somehow harness
this lightning   
   channel it into the flux capacitor   
    it just might work 
next saturday night
we re sending you back to the future 
all right  saturday s good 
i can spend a week in 1955 
i can hang out  you can show me around 
that is out of the question 
you must not leave this house 
you must not see or talk to anybody 
anything you do can have repercussions
on future events  do you understand 
yeah  sure  okay 
marty   
   have you interacted with anybody else
today besides me 
yeah  well  i might ve sort of
bumped into my parents 
great scott  let me see that photograph
again of your brother 
just as i thought  this proves my theory 
look at your brother 
marty 
his head s gone  it s like it s been erased 
erased from existence 
they really cleaned this place up 
looks brand new 
doc  according to my theory  you interfered
with your parents  first meeting 
if they don t meet  they won t fall in love 
get married or have kids 
that s why your brother s disappearing 
your sister will follow  and unless
you repair the damage  you re next 
marty  sounds heavy 
doc  weight has nothing to do with it 
which one s your pop 
that s him 
okay  okay  you guys 
very funny 
you guys are being real mature 
maybe you were adopted 
george  okay  real mature  guys 
george  okay  pick up my books 
strickland  mcfly 
that s strickland 
jesus  didn t that guy ever have hair 
shape up  man  you re a slacker 
do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life 
no 
  what did your mother see in him 
  i don t know 
i guess she felt sorry for him
 cause her dad hit him with the car 
he hit me with the car 
that s the florence nightingale effect 
it happens in hospitals when
nurses fall in love with their patients 
go to it  kid 
george  buddy 
i have been looking all over for you 
you remember me 
the guy who saved your life the other day 
  yeah 
  there s somebody i d like you to meet 
lorraine 
calvin 
i d like you to meet
my good friend george mcfly 
hi  it s really a pleasure to meet you 
  how s your head 
  good  fine 
i ve been worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night 
are you okay 
  i m sorry  i have to go 
  come on 
isn t he a dreamboat 
  she didn t even look at him 
  this is more serious than i thought 
your mother is infatuated with you
instead of your father 
wait a minute  doc 
are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me 
  precisely 
  this is heavy 
there s that word again   heavy  
why are things so heavy in the future 
is there a problem with the earth s gravity 
the only way we re going to
get them to mate is if they re alone 
you ve got to get them to interact   
   in some sort of social   
  you mean like a date 
  right 
what kind of date 
what do kids do in the  50s 
they re your parents 
you must know them 
what are their common interests 
what do they like to do together 
nothing 
doc  look  there s a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up 
the enchantment under the sea dance 
they re supposed to go to this 
  that s where they kiss for the first time 
  all right  kid 
you stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes her to that dance 
marty  george  buddy   
   remember that girl
i introduced you to  lorraine 
what are you writing 
stories 
mr  mcfly  science fiction stories
about visitors   
   coming down to earth
from other planets 
get out of town 
i didn t know you did anything creative 
  let me read some 
  no  no 
i never let anybody read my stories 
marty  why not 
what if they didn t like them 
what if they told me i was no good 
i guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand 
no  no  not hard at all 
so anyway  george  about lorraine 
she really likes you 
she told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her   
   to the enchantment
under the sea dance 
  really 
  yeah 
all you got to do is go over there
and ask her 
right here  right now  in the cafeteria 
what if she said no  i don t know
if i could take that kind of rejection 
besides  i think she d rather go
with somebody else 
marty  who 
biff 
  don t kid around  come on 
  come on  leave 
biff  you know you want it 
you know you want me to give it to you 
shut your filthy mouth 
i m not that kind of girl 
maybe you are
and you just don t know it yet 
get your meat hooks off of me 
marty  you heard her 
she said  get your meat hooks   
   off 
marty  please 
what s it to you  butthead 
biff  you been looking for a fight 
since you re new here 
i m going to cut you a break

doc 
hi  marty  i didn t hear you come in 
fascinating device  this video unit 
listen  doc 
marty  i haven t told you about   
doc  one shouldn t know about his own destiny 
  you don t understand 
  i do 
if i know too much
i endanger my own existence   
   just as you ve endangered yours 
you re right 
let me show you my plan
for sending you home 
please excuse the crudity of this model 
i didn t have time to build it to scale
or paint it 
  it s good 
  thank you 
we run industrial strength electrical cable
from the top of the clock tower   
    down  suspending it over the street
between these two lampposts 
meanwhile  we ve outfitted the time
vehicle with this big pole and hook   
   which runs directly
into the flux capacitor 
at the calculated moment   
   you start off from down the street   
    driving directly toward the cable 
accelerating to 88 miles per hour 
according to the flyer  at precisely
10 04 p m  this saturday night   
   lightning will strike the clock tower 
electrifying the cable   
    as the connecting hook makes contact   
    thereby sending 1 21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor   
   and sending you back to 1985 
doc  all right  now  watch this 
you wind up the car and release it 
i ll simulate the lightning 
ready 
set 
release 
marty  you re instilling me
with a lot of confidence 
don t worry  i ll take care of ideas 
you take care of your pop 
by the way   
   what happened today  did he ask her out 
  i think so 
  what did she say 
it s your mom  she s tracked you down 
quick  let s cover the time machine 
hi  cal    marty 
marty  lorraine 
how did you know i was here 
i followed you 
this is my doc    my uncle   
   doc brown 
  hi 
  hi 
lorraine 
marty  this may seem a little forward   
   but i was kind of wondering   
   if you d ask me to the   
   enchantment under the sea dance
on saturday 
you mean   
you mean nobody s asked you 
lorraine  no 
not yet 
  what about george 
  george mcfly 
he s kind of cute and all  but not   
well   
i think a man should be strong   
   so he can stand up for himself   
   and protect the woman he loves 
don t you 
yeah 
i still don t understand 
how am i supposed to
go to the dance with her   
   if she s already going
to the dance with you 
well  because  george 
she wants to go with you 
she just doesn t know it yet 
that s why we got to show her
that you  george  are a fighter 
you re somebody who stands up
for yourself and will protect her 
yeah  but i ve never picked a fight
in my entire life 
look  you re not going
to be picking a fight  dad   
dad dad daddy o 
you re coming to her rescue  right 
let s go over the plan again 
8 55  where are you going to be 
i m going to be at the dance 
  and where am i going to be 
  you ll be in the car  with her 
right around 9 00 
she s going to get very angry with me 
why is she going to get angry with you 
well  because  george  nice girls get angry
when guys take advantage of them 
  you re going to go touch her on her   
  no  no  george  look 
it s just an act  right 
so  9 00  you re strolling
through the parking lot 
you see us struggling in the car 
you walk up  you open the door 
and you say   
your line  george 
hey  you  get your damn hands off her 
  you really think i ought to swear 
  definitely 
goddamn it  george  swear 
okay  so now you come up 
you punch me in the stomach 
i m out for the count  right 
and you and lorraine
live happily ever after 
you make it sound so easy 
i just    i wish i wasn t so scared 
there s nothing to be scared of 
all it takes is self confidence 
you know  if you put your mind to it   
   you can accomplish anything 
announcer 
hill valley weather this saturday night 
mostly clear  with some scattered clouds 
lows tonight  in the upper forties 
are you sure about this storm 
since when can weathermen predict
the weather  let alone the future 
you know  marty 
i m going to be very sad to see you go 
you ve made a difference in my life 
given me something to shoot for 
just knowing
that i m going to be around to see 1985 
that i m going to succeed in this 
that i m going to have a chance
to travel through time 
it s going to be hard
waiting 30 years to talk to you   
   about everything that s happened
in the past few days 
i m really going to miss you  marty 
i m going to miss you 
  doc  about the future   
  no 
we ve agreed that information about
the future can be extremely dangerous 
even if your intentions are good 
it can backfire drastically 
whatever you ve got to tell me i ll find out
through the natural course of time 
 dear dr  brown 
 on the night that i go back in time   
    you will be   
    shot by terrorists 
 please take whatever precautions are
necessary to prevent this terrible disaster 
 your friend   
    marty  
 evening  dr  brown  what s with the wire 
just a little weather experiment 
  what you got under here

hey  come on  i had to change 
do you think i m going back

let s send you back at exactly
the same time 
it ll be like you never left 
now  i painted a white line
on the street way over there 
that s where you ll start from 
i ve calculated the precise distance   
   taking into account
the acceleration speed   
   and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment the lightning strikes   
   which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds 
when this alarm goes off  you hit the gas 
right 
well  i guess that s everything 
  thanks 
  thank you 
doc  see you in about 30 years 
i hope so 
don t worry 
as long as you hit that wire   
   with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour   
   the instant the lightning
strikes the tower   
doc  everything will be fine 
marty  right 
  what s the meaning of this 
  you ll find out in 30 years 
it s about the future  isn t it 
doc  information about the future

i warned you about this  kid 
the consequences could be disastrous
