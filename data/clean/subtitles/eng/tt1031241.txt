well  they were wrong 
are you mr  boggis 
ah 
you re master tolly 
i remember you as smaller 
i was smaller  i ve grown 
yes  yeah  i suppose
you would have 
mrs  oldknow
would have met you 
but the  r a f  decided
to move out 
they only told her
this morning 
your grandmother s looking
forward to seeing you 
is she 
aren t you gonna wear
your coat 
all right 
we ve heard about mr  david 
he s not dead 
nobody says he s dead 
not even the telegram 
he s just missing inaction 
that s all 
ah  missing 
that s it  that s it 
how s your mother 
all right  but busy 
she s trying to find out
where he is 
she s had to go to london 
yeah  i expect she has 
i expect we ll have some news
any day now 
i mean 
when you re taken prisoner 
someone s got
to know something 
mm 
yes  i think they have 
um  would you double check   
uh  has someone checked
the music room 
hello  tolly 
hello 
do i still call you  granny  
well  what else
did you have in mind 
i don t know   mrs  oldknow  
no   i think we d better stick
with  granny  
i m sorry i couldn t meet you 
i just didn t dare
leave them to it 
are you sad they re going 
no 
we oldknows like to be
left to our own devices 
i think that s just about it 
i ve told them to put everything
back and under dust sheets 
so i expect it s all wrong 
ah  we ll sort it out 
i hope we haven t been
too awful 
well  you didn t pull
the place down 
so you did better than some 
well  i m not sure the house
would have let us 
goodbye 
does this mean all the soldiers
will be home soon 
well  there s an awful lot
of cleaning up to do 
but most of them should be here
before too long 
everything ready to go  sir 
right o  thank you 
bye  again 
you remember mrs  tweedie 
how do you do 
oh  course he don t 
why should he 
he weren t much more than
a scrap when he was last here 
and this is bismarck 
he remembers you 
now you come along with me 
and we ll get you settled in 
here we are 
lovely 
how long have you worked here 
oh  too man years
to think about 
do you like it 
yes  i do 
though  it s a funny old house 
no doubt about that 
but it s our funny old house 
that s what my dad used to say 
he used to talk about
this place all the time 
you come down
when you re ready 
you don t have to worry 
i know he s alive 
i think i ll still worry a bit 
if it s all right with you 
won t you sit down 
who are all these people 
they re your family 
but they re dead  aren t they 
i thought family meant
people who were living 
i dare say the distinction is
more important in manchester 
than further south 
have you ever been
to manchester 
not that i recall 
so  how do you know
so much about it 
is your mother well 
has she found a place
in london to stay 
i know you don t like her 
you don t have to pretend 
i didn t think i was pretending 
here we are 
there s bread for toast 
toasting fork s there 
well  give me a shout
if you need anything else 
thank you  mrs  tweedie 
it s not true i don t like her 
i don t know her 
you didn t want him
to marry her 
no 
why was that 
was it because she was common 
certainly not 
you wrote that she was common 
and not fit to sweep the leaves
up on the drive 
i saw the letter 
well  sometimes
when you re angry 
you can overstate your case 
he shouldn t have shown that
to you 
he didn t  i found it 
then he shouldn t have kept it 
he kept all your letters 
i was worried she wouldn t
understand green knowe 
she d come from something
very different 
anyway  it s immaterial now 
why 
i don t think i shall be here
for much longer 
why  what s happened 
nothing 
the world s changing 
that s all 
i don t think i ll have
enough money to stay 
you can t sell it 
i may have to 
but it s never been sold 
uuh  it s never been sold
till now 
we ve come close a few times 
she brought us
right to the brink 
mrs  thomas oldknow   
like you 
hardly 
that s maria van raymer 
she was dutch 
grew up in india 
she married captain oldknow
in calcutta 
then he brought her home 
green knowe must have
seemed very dull 
after such exotic beginnings 
would you do your own sugar 
what s this bit 
it looks different 
that was maria s new wing 
it was built
so she could entertain 
is it because dad s missing   
why you re going to leave 
no  it isn t 
you mustn t think that 
if there was anyway
i could avoid it 
i promise you  i would 
he always said this house
was a part of you 
it s a part of all of us 
it s a part of your father 
part of you  too 
you don t know the place yet 
and you don t know me 
so  i suppose it s hard
for you to understand 
if you think that  then you
don t know me  either 
you re burning your toast 
aw 
hello 
they look like jewellery boxes 
so they were   
for maria oldknow s jewels 
they must have been put
up there before the fire 
what fire 
when the new wing burned down 
granny says she almost lost
green knowe 
but why  if she was so rich 
she didn t have money 
her father
was a diamond merchant 
and her fortune was all
in precious stones 
she could have sold them 
she could have 
but by the time she needed to 
they d been stolen 
do you think she cried
when she lost the jewels 
why 
do you 
i m sure she did  wouldn t you 
i m afraid she took it out
on the captain 
for quite awhile afterwards 
did they have children 
they did 
they had a son called sefton   
ah    and a daughter
called susan 
and you descend from sefton 
what a funny name 
i don t think
someone called to towsland 
is in much of a position
to talk 
was sefton nice 
no  he was selfish and spoiled 
the door in the dining room 
with the brick wall
behind it   
was that the way
through to maria s wing 
it was 
oh  look 
you might like this 
it was your father s 
i made the pyjamas when
david had whooping cough 
so they could both
have whooping cough together 
i m too old for it  really 
yes  i know 
i just thought
it might interest you 
to know it was his 
was susan spoiled and selfish
like her brother 
no  not at all 
no  it would be hard
to spoil her 
why 
enough 
good night 
he s a real manchester lad 
i offered to send him
to a proper school 
i was happy to pay
for his whole education 
but of course she wouldn t hear of it 
why not 
she didn t want him taught
to look down on her 
so selfish 
you d think
she d put him first 
obviously his father
agreed with her 
only because he was hypnotized 
well  i don t think
it s done him any harm 
he seems as bright
as a button to me 
she s a controller  that s all 
i m not attacking her 
i m just stating a fact 
that s why she s kept him away 
he s only here now 
because she couldn t think
how else to manage things 
it was exactly the same with
david  right from the start   
she could never share him 
could you 
sefton  is that you 
what where you thinking of 
wandering off like that 
supposing you d have
fallen down the stairs 
and broken your neck 
what would you say then 
very little  i should think 
never mind your cheek 
come back to your own room now 
but  perkins 
i was only talking to   
is it sefton 
there s nobody here 
miss susan 
what are you doing downstairs 
well  i hope
it s something serious 
are you ill 
no 
well  what is it 
do you    do you believe in   
well  yes 
in ghosts   
do you believe in ghosts 
certainly  i do  don t you 
i do now 
oh 
oh  i see  yes 
which of them was it 
susan 
well  yes  it would be 
after all those questions 
you d better go to bed 
you ll get cold 
do you want some more hot milk 
hmm 
mr  boggis 
mrs  tweedie
told me about the fire 
how far did the
missing wing stretch 
beyond the cedar tree there 
they planted that 
when they tore what was left
of it down 
one big room for dining 
drawing room 
family bedrooms above 
but it seems big enough
as it is 
eh 
i think i ll climb the oak tree 
don t do yourself a mischief 
susan  susan  is that you 
it s sefton s spur 
we ll clean it up
and put it with its pair 
is there a picture of sefton 
yes  it s there 
boggis has brought the tree
into the music room 
still a bit of a mess in there 
i m afraid 
i thought we could
tidy it up later 
then we could
decorate the tree 
you don t have to 
it s all right  i ll do it 
why would sefton
hide his own spur 
oh  he didn t 
he wasn t the  s  
and the  j was for someone
who changed susan s life 
unfortunately  not everyone 
was pleased to see him
at green knowe 
there was a butler here then
called john caxton 
he might have been kinder 
welcome home  captain 
thank you  caxton 
thank you  one and all 
father  oh 
my darling 
what s this 
oh 
she was running
all over the house  sir 
she would have done herself
an injury 
so she was tethered like a dog 
did you know about it 
what else were we do to 
would you rather
she fell down the stairs 
she s blind  thomas 
she simply must get used to it 
but i am used to it  papa 
i m so very  very used to it 
how are you  maria 
how should i be 
after seven months in prison 
and no one but a blind girl
for company 
you ve not been ill  i hope 
no  since you don t count
fatigue or melancholy 
as illness 
where s sefton 
hello  father 
were you not here to keep
your mother and sister company 
some of the time 
don t fuss the boy 
now  let s go in 
oh  are you not curious to see
what i ve brought 
my dear 
oh  spurs 
i thought you wanted some 
you re too late 
lord farrar gave him
a pair last month 
finer than these  i m afraid 
were they  indeed 
finer than these 
well  he s the boy s godfather 
i suppose he can
give him a present 
i suppose he can 
why was farrar here 
he was staying nearby 
and looked in with some friends
for an evening 
did you play 
i could hardly refuse
in my own house 
it would have looked
extraordinary 
how much did you lose  maria 
a little 
a little 
a little or a lot 
what difference does it make 
you ll be angry either way 
what about me  father 
is there nothing for me 
ah  well  now 
one would have thought 
let me see 
ah  no  there seems to be
nothing here  unless   
tell me  please 
help me 
oh  mother  do say 
it s me 
this    is jacob 
he ll be your special helper 
now take him  round the grounds
and show him his new home 
but first   
burn it 
captain  is that wise 
come  jacob 
walk with me 
and you can describe
what you see 
this is a fine place 
is it 
sure  i never saw a   
my dad used to talk about
decorating the tree in here 
look 
this was his favourite 
you hang it 
to remember him by 
i don t need to remember him 
yes  your father
loved this one   
when he was a boy 
you could give parties
in a room like this 
well  that s what
it was built for 
we ll have one
when he gets back 
mm 
we had wonderful dances
when i was a girl 
oh  blow me down 
what on earth is all this 
it s a bible 
oh 
it s the captain s bible 
how odd 
i wondered where it had got to 
i hadn t seen it for years 
he s made it look as
if jacob was his son 
so he has 
like this    ah  
aren t you coming in 
of course 
where did you find him 
well  i suppose the truth of it
is that he found me 
he appeared on board
the day we sailed 
he s runaway 
a runaway  a runaway what 
what do you think 
a runaway slave  of course 
he was going to be sold
in the market at charleston 
but somehow he gave them the
slip and made for the harbour 
and sneaked on to your ship 
he heard we were bound
for england 
so he swam out that night
and climbed aboard 
i hid him in a barrel for
the harbour master s inspection 
and here he is 
but doesn t that mean
he s somebody s property 
i ll pretend i didn t hear that 
isn t it forbidden to keep
a stowaway aboard 
and if it is   
to help jacob or any
slave to freedom 
i d break every rule
in the book 
oh  he s as bright
as a button  maria 
i never knew a boy so quick 
don t let sefton hear you 
hmm 
so  what will you do
with him now 
well  as i said  he ll be
a friend for susan 
i thought you were joking 
he ll change her life 
i promise you 
he can read to her 
he can learn with her 
he ll be her eyes 
that s as maybe 
go on 
well  apart from anything else 
he s    not english 
do you think such distinctions
mean anything to her 
come  come  my love 
you know better than anyone 
what it is like to be a stranger
in a foreign land 
be kind to him 
but he s a boy 
i had noticed 
then there s perkins 
dismiss her 
susan s too old
to have a nurse  anyway 
but a boy can t wait on a girl 
who s to bathe her or dress her 
and where will he live 
find him a room in the stables
and hire a maid if you must 
from now on 
jacob is susan s companion 
you talk as if your former slave
isn t even to be a servant 
what will people say 
nothing that will interest me 
we ll be a laughing stock 
i don t expect he ll stay long 
mr  sefton 
i don t  really 
i don t think he ll find
he fits in 
but he did fit in 
of course  susan was blind 
i should have realized 
what do you mean 
how did jacob cope
with susan s blindness 
oh  he wouldn t have
thought about it 
oh 
the point is  he set her free 
he gave her wings 
it s much too big for just us 
but we don t care  do we 
we do not 
who s he 
st  christopher  of course 
why is he here 
nobody knows 
he s always stood here 
did the old part burn 
a bit  not too much 
why not 
because fred boggis
got a bucket line going 
there was a boggis here then 
there s always been a boggis
at green knowe 
after the fire  the captain
built a big music room 
to replace the rooms
that were lost 
ah 
she never cared for it 
i don t think their marriage
was all that easy 
not many of them are 
master tolly  not too many 
are you married  mr  boggis 
i am 
things are really quite
peaceful at the moment 
as it happens 
yep  really quite peaceful 
oh  just making a cup of coffee
for your grandmother 
would you like one 
mrs  tweedie 
hmm 
have you ever seen any of them 
any what 
any of the people
who lived here before 
the oldknows 
mrs  oldknow lives here now 
don t she 
or have i got that wrong 
i mean susan 
for instance  or caxton 
don t go stuffing your head 
with all that
superstitious nonsense 
 let the dead bury the dead    
that s what the bible says 
i ve never understood that 
how can the dead bury the dead 
i don t know 
but i do know
if i don t get a move on 
this coffee s gonna be cold 
door  please 
who is it  who s there 
what are you talking about

in the nursery  when perkins
came and took me away 
last year 
two nights ago  you mean 
jacob  jacob 
quickly    where can he hide 
bring him round here 
get him in the cupboard 
get in the cupboard 
where is the little beggar 
who 
don t you dare take his side 
do you think i don t see you
together  grinning and laughing 
you shouldn t be so funny 
mr  sefton 
getaway from there 
leave her alone 
now  you come along with me 
little jacob 
i ve got a job for you 
the captain says
i m to stay with susan 
 miss susan  
you impertinent blackguard 
miss susan 
i was told to follow
miss susan s orders 
i m giving the orders now 
pardon  sir 
but the captain did say 
he was only to take orders
from miss susan 
keep out of this  boggis 
or you ll be sorry 
but i heard him 
silence  how dare you parade
your insolence here 
leave him be 
you wouldn t do this
if papa was at home 
well  he isn t  is he  
no  get off 
let him go 
can i help  tell me 
let go of me 
don t take on  miss susan 
  he won t hurt him  he wouldn t dare 
  but who   
come on 
let s see what s happening 
no  get off 
uh 
sefton  leave him alone 
back  you cat 
control yourself 
i ve got a job for him 
that s all 
i shot a pheasant today
that fell into the chimney 
and i want it 
don t  jacob  don t do it 
can t you stop this 
mr  caxton 
none of this would happen
if the master was home 
hold your tongue  girl 
when the captain s away 
mr  sefton s master here 
get on  you little tyke 
i want my bird 
and i m tired of waiting 
don t  don t 
it s all right  i can do it 
see  you re the one
making all the fuss 
now take her upstairs
before i really lose my temper 
come with me 
you can wait in your room 
he ll be all right 
faster 
robert    light the fire 
that ll speed things up a bit 
you don t have to do this 
you know 
he can t force you  robert 
  what kind of man are you 
  oh  well   
robert  no 
come on 
don t make a meal of it 
my god 
for two pins i d   
you d what 
you d lose your place 
that s what 
just pray for him 
that s all we can do now 
if it isn t lord farrar s
precious spurs 
should someone go up after him 
and exactly who would
you suggest  sir 
i maybe in for a spot of bother 
if anything happens to him 
boggis  clear this out 
dampen it down 
it was only a bit of fun  man 
where s your sense of humour 
finer than the captain s 
are they 
what  who is it 
shh  it s me 
jacob 
are you all right 
are you hurt 
i m all right 
will you help me
play a trick on mr  sefton 
oh  for heaven s sake  susan 
i m too busy for this 
sefton  what s going on 
i told you   
he sent jacob up the chimney 
is this true 
why does it matter 
is it true 
and if it is 
my darling 
you ve been foolish 
what will you tell your father
if the boy comes to any harm 
mr  sefton was shooting 
and a bird fell
into the chimney 
wouldn t it have been more
foolish to have left it there 
thank you  caxton 
when i want your advice 
i shall ask for it 
what s that 
mr  sefton  sir  i got your bird 
oh  my dear 
are the gentlemen shooting
chickens these days 
that s enough  all of you 
shouldn t someone take it to
cook with the rest of the bag 
come on  jacob 
i m your mother  and
i love you very much 
but you must learn
to control your temper 
or you ll end up in worse
trouble than this 
that ll teach him 
i doubt it 
what we have to put up with 
worse things happen at sea 
take it away  caxton 
very good  sir 
i want to be rid of him  caxton 
i want him out of this house 
how dare he prance about 
waving my father s favour
in my face 
how dare he 
patience  mr  sefton  patience 
oh  when  oh  when 
will we be free of these
frightful coupons 
mum says rationing will get
worse before it gets better 
it will 
she s right  i m afraid 
i mean  it seems so unfair
when the war s nearly over 
if only things could
get back to normal 
she doesn t think things
will ever be normal again 
oh  yes 
well  a different normal 
but normal 
you take my word for it 
i m so glad you could
come and stay 
i should hate to think you had
no memories of the old place 
before it went 
morning 
i ve got some memories
now  all right 
well  you mustn t be frightened 
the house is bound
to share some secrets 
but you mustn t be scared 
i don t think i m scared 
i don t know
what i feel exactly 
good 
very few people realize
they don t know what they feel 
until they re at least 40 
tolly  tolly  you
do understand   
death is not
the important thing 
what is  then 
whether you were loved or not 
that s what people think about
at the end of their lives 
do you believe that 
yes  i do 
you can t possibly be
warm in just that 
granny  hmm 
you ve never seen him 
have you 
since he s been missing 
because i haven t 
i mean  i m sure he s all right 
because if he wasn t  i think
i would have seen him
by now  don t you 
and if you had  you would
have told me  wouldn t you 
yes  i would have told you 
and  no  i haven t seen him 
that s something  anyway 
mm hmm 
well  here s the shopping 
what there is of it 
thank you  tolly 
where s boggis 
he was working on the brambles
in the tower garden 
where s that 
beyond the stone coronet 
then turn left 
why won t he wear a proper coat 
 cause he s a boy 
boggis is kind  but if
i eat another rabbit 
i swear i ll turn into one 
he will keep bringing them in 
no matter what i say 
ooh 
you ve got your work cut out 
i don t know how we let it
turn into this 
why is it called
the tower garden 
because of the tower 
what tower 
over there 
yeah  well  i suppose
you can t see it now 
when did it get so growed over 
what was it used for 
water tower  i think  first 
with a big bath underneath 
a bath 
you mean  like 
 having a bath  
yeah  i know 
seems funny  don t it 
can i see 
too dark to see anything 
i ve got a torch 
it s much bigger down here 
a bath was a big event
in those days 
they dug out all
these tunnels and rooms 
so they d have parties under
the ground while they bathed 
like the romans 
yeah 
then they put plumbing
in the house 
and forgot about this place 
turned it into a garden
ornament  a folly 
when was this  before the fire 
oh  yeah  20 years or more 
mind you    it came in handy 
a few days before
the fire happened 
why 
never you mind 
he swore it was the same
as our usual brand 
it looks simply revolting 
war means sacrifice 
i think tolly s all right 
yes 
it s a funny old house to
wake up and find yourself in 
yes 
but it s our funny old house 
that s what he said 
did he  did he  really 
it s going to have to go 
i m afraid so 
i do the sums 
they don t change 
ain t there nothing
you can sell 
not really 
nothing that would make
any difference 
you d think there d be
an old master 
tucked in here somewhere 
oh  we had a vermeer once 
heaven knows
we could use it now 
i just wish i didn t feel
i was cheating tolly 
oh  he s a sensible boy 
he ll get through it 
besides  he s got more
important things to worry about 
he never stops thinking
about his father  for a start 
well  none of us do 
no 
what shall we do 
we have to stop them
finding him 
we have to 
who are you 
you can see me 
of course i can see you 
why shouldn t i see you 
who is this boy 
i think he might be a   
a relation of mine 
you are  aren t you  in a way 
in a way 
but i know your family 
and i can assure you
this ain t none of them 
shall i start
with what he s wearing 
it s all right  jacob 
maybe he can help 
what s happened 
fred boggis   
they caught him poaching 
just some hares 
now sefton means
to sell him to the gang 
what gang  the press gang 
they kidnap men
to crew the ships 
why 
how else they gonna get
enough sailors 
so he ll have to go
with the gang 
and sefton and caxton will split
what they can get for him 
the stupid thing is 
my father would save him 
and he s due back any day 
caxton knows he s
still here somewhere 
he s watching us all the time 
where s fred hiding 
there s a maze of tunnels
under the old water tower 
i know it  i ll find him 
go to the kitchen first 
he hasn t had anything
to eat for three days 
and you can find out
if you re visible or not 
excuse me 
nothing from the captain yet 
mrs  robbins 
most inconsiderate  i must say 
how can we plan our menus 
without so much
as a  by your leave  
menus are not of much interest
to the admiralty  mrs  gross 
yes  girl 
i was just wondering 
if there was any news
about fred boggis 
really  rose 
well  i was just wondering
if you had any work to do 
because if not 
why do we pay your wages 
yes  mrs  gross 
not that i wouldn t like
to give her a word of comfort 
mr  sefton s very hard
on young boggis 
that i do think 
mr  caxton s put him up to it 
mr  caxton gets above his self
when the captain s away 
he s cleverer than
the people he works for 
if you ask me  that s always
a recipe for trouble 
and he certainly takes on 
a great many of the
captain s duties 
now  now 
aah 
rose  whatever is the matter
with you  girl 
i i just   
nothing  ma am 
i cut my finger 
get on with your work 
yes  ma am 
i just need to get
some more milk  ma am 
who are you 
are you a    ghost 
i don t think i can be 
i mean  i m not dead 
come to think of it 
i m not actually even born yet 
what 
never mind all that 
i need something
for fred boggis to eat 
fred 
can you help  of course 
have you seen him 
is he all right 
i don t know yet 
what about this pie 
well  that will never work 
put it inside your clothes 
that might do it 
it s worth a try 
well  what if caxton
and his men can see you 
some people can  i did 
let s just hope they can t  then 
if you do get to fred 
tell him to look after himself 
tell him rose said so 
i will 
aah 
fred 
are you down here 
fred 
fred 
fred 
are you here 
fred 
susan told me to come 
who are you 
you can see me  then 
of course i can 
and i should think everyone
else can see you  too 
no  no one did 
what s that 
it s just a torch 
i ve brought you some food 
torch 
it s not even burning 
how s it work 
here 
thanks 
the message is 
you ve got to stay here 
but they ll find me 
they ve searched it
twice already 
one of them came so close 
i could smell his breath 
next time they re gonna
get me for sure 
no  i have to make a run
for it   
no  the captain will be home
any day now  any moment 
i promise 
and that s what
miss susan says 
it is 
all right 
i ll stay  though i may regret it 
keep hidden  and good luck 
you wouldn t lend me that 
would you 
gets so dark down here 
keep it 
don t use it too much 
the battery will run out 
and i don t expect
you ll be able to get another 
what s battery 
it s a big question 
oh  and rose said
to look after yourself 
did she  now 
rose 
fancy that 
at last we ve solved the mystery 
of the miracle light 
it s been part of our mythology
for so long 
has it 
i can t think why
i didn t guess 
it s obvious  once you know 
it was a present from my daddy 
well  then you both helped fred 
granny 
this morning i had the torch
in my pocket 
yes 
but it was already in the case 
mm  i suppose that s right 
but surely isn t that
impossible 
well    obviously not 
there s one thing
i don t understand 
only one 
lucky old you 
seriously    with ghosts 
why is it that some people
can see them and some can t 
but then others can only see
them sometimes 
well  i don t know 
it might depend on being open 
maybe we get so full
of our own affairs 
we block off everything else 
but some people can always
see them  can t they 
oh  yes 
now  look   
i ve got some very tedious
business to attend to 
why don t you go off
for a walk 
i ll see you at lunch 
all right 
bismarck  go with him 
what a useless dog 
granny  would it be all right
if i go down to the vill   
are you so lost
to proportion  sir 
that even supposing 
you were entitled to feel
aggrieved with this man 
which you were not 
it seemed reasonable to you 
to condemn him
to 10 years of slavery 
well may you be silent 
you are weak and easily led 
and those who are easily led
are not easily followed 
you are a disgrace to this family 
now go to your room  thomas   
to your room  sir 
i m sad  caxton 
after our years together 
i would have looked
for something better 
your employment is terminated 
what 
you may take a month s
wages in lieu of notice 
but  thomas 
you can t mean that 
the farrars will be here
in two days 
i can t receive them in a house
with no one to run it 
get one of the footmen
to cover his duties 
one of the footmen 
after all the hospitality
i ve had from them 
my mind is made up 
but you don t understand 
the greshams are coming 
the carberys are coming 
the northbrooks are coming 
it ll be a disaster 
put them off 
put them off 
do you know how long it s taken
me to get them to say yes 
they ve never been here before 
i hardly know them 
what will they think of me
if the house is in chaos 
why do you invite people
you don t know 
because  thomas  i m trying
to build something 
i m trying to make
a life for myself 
isn t that what you want 
and now you disgrace me 
why 
what have i done 
well  i m sure you ll manage 
i could work out my notice  sir 
if you d let me   
just until you find
someone else to take over 
out of the question 
surely i m entitled
to one favour  thomas 
and after all the time
caxton s been with us 
is it so much to ask 
it is 
the answer s no 
i feel as if i m in a crow s
nest  looking out to sea 
when i was little  i wanted
to be a sailor just like papa 
not anymore 
i m blind  and i m female 
i doubt the navy
has a place for me 
then why not be
a great explorer 
and cross all seven seas 
do you really think i could 
someone will  why not you 
jacob  nothing s impossible 
is it 
not when you really want it 
what are you doing 
i m carving our initials 
miss susan 
so one day they ll find them 
and then they can say 
  that s the famous lady traveller
and her faithful companion  
i wonder what sefton would say
if he could see us up here 
yep  i wonder 
thank you  sir 
if i hear of anymore
such incidents  maria 
i will hold you to blame 
do you understand me 
oh  perfectly 
i d be amazed
if you didn t blame me 
maria  my dear 
you mustn t think that i   
no  that s right 
i mustn t think 
i mustn t think  or i ll go mad 
i mustn t think
that you ll leave me alone 
in this desert
for months and years 
while you swan round europe
playing tag with the french 
there must be something
you can do besides gambling 
and what would that be  pray 
paying calls on neighbours
who don t like me 
who find me funny and foreign
and not to be trusted 
or should i stay home
painting fans 
knotting lace 
helping the vicar 
yes  i see what you mean 
i don t want you to be bored 
then you re doomed
to disappointment 
we both are 
the truth is  my dear 
we re not well matched 
which is my fault  i presume 
the fault is with neither
or both of us 
we thought we could be happy 
but we re not 
and it s too late now
for regrets 
who s that climbing with jacob
in the oak tree 
he should be looking
after susan 
not larking about with some boy
from the village 
and why does boggis allow it 
what are they playing at 
village boy 
don t you recognize
your ladylike daughter 
it can t be 
if you mean it shouldn t be 
i quite agree with you 
but how can she  she s   
blind 
oh  my dear 
that doesn t get in the way
of anything these days 
was this what you wanted 
when you brought
that foundling into our home 
susan 
over here 
father  oh  don t be angry 
you can t climb a tree
in a stupid dress 
trousers
are much more sensible 
give me 10 minutes to change 
and i shall look like
a model lady  i promise 
she s a good climber  sir 
and the clothes were my idea 
come here 
say you re not cross 
please  papa 
at any rate  not with her  sir 
i m not cross 
i m not cross at all 
i m not cross with any of you 
so  was everything all right
after caxton had gone 
no  i m afraid not   
because he hadn t gone 
he was still there 
when a messenger came
later that same day 
calling the captain
back to his ship 
oh  custard 
he should have waited
until caxton left 
oh  my dear  any sailor summoned
to the wars must go 
caxton  hurry  they re here 
everything s ready  ma am 
sefton  how are you 
if you d all like to go
to your rooms 
we ll have tea in here at 5 00 
nellie  tell miss susan
to join us 
and put her into the dress
that matches this one 
and jacob  ma am 
oh  send him back
to the stables 
we won t need him again today 
miss susan  your mother
wants you to join her 
come and change your frock 
not you  jacob 
there s some tea
in the kitchen 
i hate the way she treats you 
go 
susan  over here 
can this charming newcomer
be dear little susan 
curtsey to lord farrar  dear 
oh 
a fine snub for you  my lord 
my sister meant
no insult  mrs  carbery 
she s quite blind 
oh  dear  i m sorry
to hear that  mrs  oldknow 
i don t recall you ever
mentioning it before 
how vexing for you 
you re right  mrs  carbery 
to have a child born blind
is very vexing 
come here  my dear  sit by me 
of course 
aah  oh  lord 
jacob 
is she all right 
oh  my dear 
don t worry  i m here 
jacob  i thought you were told
to go back to the stables 
beg pardon  ma am 
but the captain likes me to keep
a close eye on miss susan 
if that s no bother to anyone 
bravo  i wish i had someone
to keep me out of mischief 
your wife will manage that 
surely  my lord 
i m afraid it would take up
too much of her time 
you ve found yourself
quite a champion  susan 
i think so 
i m sure all the ladies
in the room 
envy you your protector 
that s enough  susan 
you ll wear us out
with your chatter 
go along 
we hope to see you later on   
and your gallant knight 
childrenare a blessing 
of course 
but i confess to some relief
that mine are grown and gone 
heaven knows their incessant
babble and fidget 
would try the patience of job 
i believe jesus was very fond
of their company 
but of course he and joseph
were only carpenters 
not nearly such fine folk as we 
if you ll excuse me 
i have some things to see to
before we go up to dress 
we dine at 8 00 
you are a minx  lady gresham 
she d worked so hard 
to bring these people
to green knowe 
and they patronized her
from the moment they arrived 
i ve changed my mind 
i ll wear the rose taffeta tonight 
ma am 
keep the blue silk for tomorrow 
and the rubies   
the ones in gold filigree 
not the diamond setting 
yes  ma am 
oh  my heaven 
madam  come quick 
aah 
caxton was the thief 
he decided to steal them
the moment he was sacked 
that s why he
wanted to stay on 
well  they shredded his room 
they never found a thing 
and then it was too late 
maria should have cancelled
the rest of the party 
but the crime
had to be dealt with 
and the guests were reluctant
to embark on another long
journey at once 
all of which meant
that 2 days later 
14 of them sat down to dine 
your loss hasn t spoiled
your guest s appetite 
we all know there s pleasure
in a friend s misfortune 
the germans even
have a name for it 
perhaps you can win
something back tonight   
with a little luck 
in truth  i don t feel
very lucky this evening   
in anything 
i m told we re all
to be questioned tomorrow 
and all the servants 
my maid is beside herself 
it seems rather unnecessary 
but perfectly thrilling 
our poor hostess is a spectre
at her own feast 
i m relieved to know   
something can disturb
her infinite refinement 
surely you must
pity her a little 
it s hard to pity a woman   
who cares more for her jewels
than for her child 
what is it  caxton 
caxton  what s the matter 
i m sorry to have
to tell you  madam 
but    the house is on fire 
what  
what s that noise 
your lordship  don t 
oh 
you  man  open the window 
northwood  gresham 
get outside and help the ladies 
quickly  jonathan  help me 
ooh 
thomas  help me 
mrs  oldknow 
i hate to hurry you 
but i really do think 
we d find it more congenial
on the lawn 
get out of my way 
 susan by jacob  
arthur  george 
the house is on fire 
wake all the men 
and bring all the buckets
you can lay your hands on 
the house is on fire 
jacob  what s going on 
jacob

we can  lads 
jacob  wake up  jacob 
what is it  what s happening 
the house is on fire  what 
look 
susan 
the servants know the
house better than we do 
so leave them to rescue
the contents 
are there any sacks
and buckets to be had 
fred boggis has gone to get some 
what s happening 
we can slow it up if we
form a chain to the pond 
then we shall have to hold it
back as best we can 
why isn t anybody
doing anything  
come on  hurry up 
quickly  quickly  lads 
ma am  ma am 
oh  i m mad 
i should have told the men
to take the vermeer 
caxton  caxton  can you see if   
where you going 
over here  quickly  come on 
susan  where s miss susan 
where s the child 
mrs  oldknow 
maria  is she still in the house 
no  no  no  she can t be 
she won t be   
well  then where is she 
i don t know  sefton will know 
have you seen susan 
where would nellie
have taken her 
i don t know 
find mrs  gross 
find mrs  gross 
come on  hurry up 
oh  no 
why are they bothering
with that for  
it s not worth the canvas
it s painted on 
you come with me 
did anyone bring out
the bowls  
nellie  it s nellie 
have you seen susan 
i was in the kitchen
when it started 
somebody told me
she d come down 
stop that  just tell me
where her room is 
i know 
get a ladder  somebody 
no  lady  no one could
climb a ladder through that 
well  a blanket  then 
we can hold both ends and   
i know away 
you can t go in there 
yes  i can  i know how 
mr  sefton taught me 
robert  did anybody save
the plates in the dining room 
mr  caxton had most of it
in a sack 
but i ve not seen him since 
whoa 
aah 
susan 
jacob  is that you 
it s me 
oh  i knew you d come 
i knew it 
well  i didn t  but here i am 
are we going to die 
you can tell me 
i don t mind  now you re here 
we re all gonna die 
but if it s the same to you 
i d rather it wasn t right now 
but the window won t open
and the door s stuck 
and i can feel the heat
on the other side 
just do what i tell you 
come on  now 
get in there and climb 
wait for me and don t move 
aah 
let s go 
where are we now 
coming back into the old part

susan 
susan  my darling 
well done  guv  well done 
by george  that was a good
night s work  young man 
you should be proud
of yourself 
thank you 
for he s a jolly good fellow   
for he s a jolly good fe   
thank you  lord  thank you 
what happened to caxton 
fred boggis saw him run
upstairs with a sack 
maybe he got away with
the jewels  maybe not 
either way  he was never seen
again after the fire 
and did maria
come to love jacob 
well  she was always kind
to him after that 
if you re going to have a bath
before dinner  you better go 
granny  hmm 
why are you called
mrs  oldknow 
if you grew up here  shouldn t
you be mrs  something else 
your grandfather and i
were second cousins 
so  you re more of an
oldknow than anyone 
you must have thought
you d always live here 
well  if i did 
i should have realized 
there s no such thing
as  always    
not on earth 
it s the table centre
for christmas day 
is it worth it 
going to all this bother
when it s just us 
can t have christmas
without doing it properly 
even in wartime 
most of all in wartime 
news 
i wish it d just stop ending
and just end 
shh  shh  shh 
general de gaulle
has issued a statement 
welcoming the russian
advance on berlin 
france is free again 
in the wake of the
french soviet treaty  signed   
the russians are moving in 
it won t be long 
we re nearly there 
   when faced
by a common enemy 
if you were a prisoner
in germany 
and no one knew where you were 
i think you might be
released now 
   when they invest and capture
the city  at home   
why not see what
boggis is up to 
lovely day 
shame to waste it 
   and so well against
the devastation 
visited on them
by the german bombing   
i know what you re thinking 
but you ll see 
   they had conferred
on the city  the queen replied 
 it is we who are
honoured to be here  
do you have a holiday at all 
plants don t know
it s christmas  do they 
but you ll take christmas day
itself off  though  won t you 
i shall go back early
for me dinner 
that ll be soon enough 
what about mrs  boggis 
won t she be lonely 
that ll be soon enough 
telegram for mrs  oldknow 
thank you 
shall i wait for an answer 
no  no  don t wait 
telegram 
what rooms did they make
the music room from 
two downstairs rooms  i think 
with some
little bedrooms above 
low servants  room  but they
give it a fine  high ceiling 
is that narrow one the
music room chimney 
no  no  no  that goes up
through the main stack 
with one from the great hall 
well  what is it  then 
why  leftover from before
the changes  i suppose 
too much trouble
to take it away 
tolly  tolly 
tolly 
come  come 
it s a telegram
from your mother 
she s coming down to see us 
when 
tomorrow 
is she staying for christmas 
i don t know  you read it 
 arriving tomorriow stop joan 
why don t we ring her 
i ve tried  there s no reply 
well  whatever it is 
she obviously doesn t want
to say it over the telephone 
at least we haven t long
to wait 
you ll be glad to see your mum 
oh  i got something for you 
thank you 
heard how yours was lost 
i ve been thinking some more
about the jewels 
oh  you and your questions 
did maria just give up 
oh  not a bit of it 
this is absurd 
without my jewels 
i m a prisoner
to the end of my days 
just to accept that
would be absurd 
i want to learn
if i can recover my   
i know why you re here 
you must embroider
a picture of the house 
the thing is  i am rather busy 
surely if i ask my maid   
you must embroider the house 
oh  very well  then 
and you will use human hair 
how perfectly disgusting 
taken from the heads 
of everyone who was there
on the night 
how could i 
we were 14 at the party 
and i ve no idea   
not just the guests   
the servants 
the guests  servants 
the villagers  whoever
came to help  everyone 
well  that s impossible 
the hair will tell you where
the jewels are to be found 
even if i do this 
would i know how to read it 
that i cannot tell you 
seems a lot of nasty work
for a very uncertain result 
i have no other answer 
but why does it have to be me 
because  mrs  oldknow 
you have overplayed your hand 
how did maria get all the hair 
with a lot of difficulty 
the word went  round 
in the end  everyone helped 
except lady farrar 
she refused  point blank 
so  what happened 
her husband found some
on her hairbrush 
i think he rather liked maria 
does the picture still exist 
yes  it s that one  there 
which is susan s 
oh  hers is easy 
 cause it was long 
maria used it for the trees 
and jacob s 
well  his was short 
in the end  she sewed that
little bird with it  see 
but it didn t deliver
the jewels 
five generations of oldknows
have stared at that picture 
and never found the clue 
maybe it was a trick 
of course it didn t work 
caxton s was missing 
without his  the picture
wasn t finished 
no  it was 
he d given a lock of hair
to someone he was keen on 
maria 
oh  certainly not   
a housemaid 
why did you say that 
no reason 
anyway  maria used it
for a chimney 
i think it s that one there 
there wasn t much of it 
come on 
into bed and don t
read too long 
you don t want to be tired
for your mother tomorrow 
granny  hmm 
can you be nice to her
when she gets here 
please 
oh 
you make me
feel rather ashamed 
of course i ll be nice to her 
 cause we all love dad 
don t we  all three of us 
i know he d like it if we re all
getting along when he comes back 
yes  of course he would 
i think she s found him 
i think she knows where he is 
we mustn t raise our
hopes up too high 
i don t think my hopes
could get any higher 
no  nor mine  really 
but   
but what 
no  never mind  never mind 
we ll cross that bridge
when we come to it 
tolly  yes 
if you have children 
don t ever quarrel with them 
no matter the reason 
no matter how angry you get   
don t quarrel 
i promise you   
it s never worth it 
you do know i love you more
than anyone else in the world 
except for daddy 
except for david 
i m glad 
good 
because i wouldn t want there to
be any confusion on that score 
good night 
night 
maria used it for one
of the chimneys 
low servants  room 
but they give it
a fine  high ceiling 
fred boggis saw him
run upstairs with a sack 
maybe he got away
with the jewels  maybe not 
get out of my way 
don t go up there 
that staircase is going 
you won t get back 
of course 
thank you for helping us
with fred 
i don t know what we should
have done without you 
i heard he was all right 
oh  yes  he never
left green knowe 
he married
a kitchen maid    rose 
i thought he might 
he can t hurt you 
did he start the fire 
he meant to start it
in revenge and go 
he had the jewels 
but the silver tempted him 
and then the gold 
he d gone back up to hide it
in the chimney of his room 
when the fire took him 
but nobody ever knew 
you know 
i know now 
you re looking for the one
behind you 
the one with the rope 
the next one
serves the music room 
but you want the disused chimney
beyond that arch 
it s blocked by the
new ceiling below 
thank you for helping us 
thank you 
tolly 
what on earth
have you been doing 
you ve got to come to the music
room now    quickly 
come on  what are you doing 
what have you been doing
with yourself 
you re black 
how did you find it 
susan helped me   
and the picture and
mr  boggis and even you 
that doesn t look like much 
but these   
these are our silver plates 
look 
look    there s our crest 
oh  tolly 
fetch a table 
oh  tolly 
oh  look   
it s maria s necklace 
the one in the portrait 
oh  my  rubies 
oh  oh  tolly 
does it suit me 
oh  look 
i ve never seen so many jewels 
what do you think 
try this 
look at all these bracelets 
oh  my 
oh  look at the rings 
oh  tolly 
ouch 
so  green knowe can be saved
and everything put right 
it can  it most certainly can 
you won t sell all the jewels 
don t worry 
you will not blush for
your mother or your wife 
what is it  tolly 
i ve been thinking
about ghosts 
don t they come back   
if they come back   
as they were when they died 
i ll just get started
on the washing up 
oh  thank you  well   
don t they 
well  no  not always 
but as a rule  yes 
why 
you know why 
i m afraid i do 
it s true  they died 
as children 
well  it wasn t unusual then 
what did they die of 
it s hard to say 
no doubt something a pill
would cure in a week today 
together 
well  susan went first 
and jacob just
a few hours after 
with the captain
holding his hand 
and crying his eyes out 
poor man 
but that makes it bearable 
don t you see 
those children
were both truly loved 
so they re not sad 
and it s our job not
to think of them as sad 
what s the matter 
nothing 
race you back to the house 
that s not fair 
i wasn t ready 
what s that 
it can t be 
oh  tolly 
oh  my dear 
there  come 
let s go inside 
tolly  come on 
let    let s all be together
