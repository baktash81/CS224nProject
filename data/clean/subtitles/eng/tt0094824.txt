you look like you never had a job 
  mr hartounian  i presume 
  yes 
we represent
the historical preservation society 
i have a temporary injunction   
restraining you from demolishing any
structures on the armstrong estate   
until the city planning commission
rules on our appeal 
what are you talking about 
this is nothing but an old dump 
this building is over 70 years old 
it s part of our heritage 
what are you talking about 
this is a garage  can t you see that 
do you come from
a long line of mechanics 
it was a carriage house 
it s one of the original buildings
on what was the armstrong estate 
the property line of which
ran down to this brook 
does this look like a brook to you 
this is not a brook  lady 
this is a sewer 
originally it was a brook 
originally your family comes from
monkeys  what s that got to do with it 
this property has been laying here 
dead  for 25 years  do you know that 
all of a sudden  i buy it 
i try to put up some decent housing
that working people can afford 
and what do i get  a historical society

hartounian  in this club 
oh  you mean jack  here he is 
  hello 
  how do you do 
  i m miffy s father  chandler young 
  chandler young 
i m at a disadvantage 
i only have one last name 
and quite an interesting
last name it is 
  hartounian 
  what is your background 
my background  my father was armenian 
my mother was half jewish 
half english  half spanish 
  that s three halves 
  oh  she was a big woman 
i thought you should meet chandler 
he s the club president 
you can play golf with him 
if that goes well  a cocktail or two 
and er  maybe some light petting later 
i ll leave that up to you  chandler 
well  i got a thing 
he s a little strange 
elizabeth

hi  jack  i sure like your suit 
thank you 
you re a real nice looking person 
  thank you 
  i ll come back when you re dressed

get dressed  real pleased to meet you 
wait a minute 
look what i did  i m sorry 
it s ok 
oh  is that where that goes  most women

i don t need any there 
i ve asked elizabeth and my wife
to join us to make it a foursome 
i wouldn t mind if it s a foursome 
or two twosomes  or four onesomes 
and this is my wife  cynthia 
oh  oh  hello  hello 
hello 
oh  no  absolutely not 
it s out of the question 
i refuse to play golf with this man 
then i take it you ve met 
this is the man who is trying
to destroy our community 
it was just a little disagreement
the other day 
little  
he tried to run me over
with a steam roller 
what steam roller 
bulldozer  it was a bulldozer 
i really have to apologise to you  i was
wrong  i m terribly  terribly sorry 
darling  a word 
excuse us for a moment 
jack  let s get our clubs 
  let s not make a scene 
  the man tried to kill me 
i m sure he had his reasons 
the fact is he s here 
  i promised miffy we d play 
  it s funny running into mrs young 
i bet the first time was funnier 
sorry i missed that 
besides  this is an opportunity
for you to save the armstrong estate 
you can catch more flies with honey 
mm 
i m not going to run some
heavy equipment into a girl like you 
how sweet 
  yeah 
  yes 
so  everybody happy now 
  this should be fun  don t you think 
  i don t see how 
you re the guest 
you have the honour 
i m only here 15 minutes and already
they want to give me honours 
i must be making a good impression 
you are  jack  that means
they want you to tee off  good luck 
oh  here goes 
well  this ll be it 
here we go 
now 
interesting club 
what would you call that 
it s a twelve gauge 
twelve gauge 
out of ammunition  mr hartounian 
a friend of mine at nasa sent me this 
i m surprised
that you bother coming out at all 
surely you could develop a gadget that
would allow you to sit in the club house
and punch buttons all day 
i got a friend working on that  too 
doesn t that take
some of the sport out of it 
not at all  things could go wrong 
batteries could go low  get static 
anything could happen  sometimes
the signal interferes with a pacemaker 
edward  edward 
edward  are you all right 
  bingo 
  bango 
i feel all right now 
must have been that chilidog 
he wants to become a member of bushwood 
can you imagine that 
with him around i can imagine anything 
so er    what would you say on my
chances of becoming a member here 
well  thatjust may depend on you  jack 
this is a lovely neighbourhood 
people hate to see it mucked up
with cheap apartments 
i can t tell you your business 
but you know what they say 
one hand washes the other 
you scratch my back  i ll scratch yours 
you wouldn t want to disappoint
your daughter  would you 
  there s daddy 
  oh  hi 
  i certainly wouldn t 
  why don t we get you an application 
leave the real estate business
to the lawyers 
if you want to leave it to the lawyers 
we ll leave it to them 
but remember  it was your idea 
i didn t go to one of those big  fancy
law schools like you did  mr pierpont 
so you re going to have
to explain something to me 
how in the world do you expect
mr hartounian to voluntarily
stop building on that site
and move this entire housing project
somewhere else 
i don t see it 
because  sir  he ll have no choice 
let me explain how the legal system
really works 
ok 
you see  mr blunt  if your client
doesn t voluntarily cease and desist
we ll be forced to go through the long
and very costly process of injunctions 
law suits  motions  counter motions 
hearings  appeals   
which will cost you so much
in legal fees and construction delays
you ll wish you d never heard
of the historical preservation society 
because there s no way in hell we d let
you come barging into bushwood estates
and throw up a lot of cheap housing
for blue collar trash 
which one of you
is chandler young s son 
i am 
you ve certainly made it clear how
your legal system works  mr young 
now i d like to explain a little bit
about the peter blunt system 
you see    i don t go in
for    law suits and motions
or any of that legal stuff 
no  no  see what happens is
i find out where you live
and then i come to your house  see 
and i    beat down your door
with a fuckin  baseball bat 
and then i m gonna make a bonfire
with the chippendale 
maybe roast that golden retriever 
then eat it 
then i m coming upstairs  junior 
and i m gonna grab you
by your brooks brothers pjs
and i m gonna take your brand new bmw
and cram it up your tight ass 
do we have an understanding 
  so  martha  is he in 
  he s in a meeting 
now get the hell outta here before
i really get mad and hurt somebody 
  i tried to sweet talk them 
  so i heard 
i don t think they went for it  we re
not allowed to build on bushwood estates
until we get
the planning commission ruling 
  we have to have a hearing 
  a hearing 
do me a favour  don t try to sweet talk
the planning commission  ok 
jack  have a little faith
in your lawyer 
faith in a lawyer 
  that was great  daddy 
  it really was  mr young 
thanks  kate  he s coming along nicely 
jumping a fine horse is a special blend
of strength  courage and grace 
it s a beautiful thing to watch
when it s done right 
slow down  slow down 
  elizabeth  where s the brake 
  next to the clutch 
slow down  easy  easy 
son of a bitch  you go this fast again 
i ll send you back to the beer truck 
whoa  dog food 
daddy  what are you doing here 
i asked him 
oh  kate  elizabeth 
elizabeth  my daughter kate 
oh  kate  i m so happy to meet you 
hello  i can t believe
i m seeing you on a horse 
he tells me he s been around
horses for years 
betting on them  not riding them 
you want me to be a gentleman 
they ride 
  not like that they don t 
  quite an entrance  jack 
for a moment  i was afraid
you might fall and break your neck 
or your arm  maybe strike your head
against a fence post 
maybe be dragged several miles
over rough terrain 
sweet of you to be concerned  so you re
not troubled by our lawyers  meeting 
no  not at all 
care to take a few jumps 
i don t think he s quite ready
forjumping yet  do you 
nonsense  nothing to it 
hold on tight  grip with your knees 
let the animal do all the work 
sounds like my wedding night 
your horse has quite a gas problem 
it s not the horse 
  raise all the jumps 
  yes  sir 
i mean this is crazy 
he could really get hurt 
almost definitely  i d say 
stay behind me and do exactly as i do 
go 
ha 
yee ho 
a little higher next time  higher 
you may want to urge him
a little more  jack 
come on 
up  prince 
this time  dog food  over it  over it 
one more set ofjumps  jack 
we ll make it an easy 
having fun yet  jack 
  good evening  miss 
  good evening  sir 
pop  daddy 
did you have to wear that tux 
  why  what s wrong with it 
  it s    blue 
it s notjust blue 
if you look at it this way it s purple 
if you look at it like this it s gold 
beautiful  huh  come on  sweetheart 
people here like their tuxedos black 
sure  and they like their noses red 
their blood blue  their faces white 
until they hire help and then they want
every face to be black  brown or yellow 
isn t that amazing 
i m not a hypocrite enough to go along
with a colour scheme like that 
look  pop  i don t expect
you to change all at once 
if you could just
turn down the volume a little 
i m gonna introduce you to this guy
i really like 
so could you just pretend
you like everyone 
pretend  i m jack hartounian  i can t
pretend to like people i don t like

and bites the bubbles 
nice  pop  please don t

this is the person
i was telling you about 
todd  i d like you to meet my father 
jack hartounian 
  a pleasure  sir 
  why do you look familiar 
because i m suing you  sir 
nothing personal  of course 
nothing personal  you think your head
getting busted might be personal 
you think a broken nose
might be personal 
you think your head in a toilet bowl
might be personal 
have a pig in a blanket 
i love yourjacket 
doesn t he look nice  todd 
kate  it s always a pleasure 
thank you 
come with me  jack  just over here 
  he s a very funny man

cynthia 
you must be happy to see me  huh 
of course 
hello there  how are you 
what s happening 
look at this conversation i just had 
it s great  it s the first time in here
that someone else got the cold shoulder 
do you think i care 
i like to talk to myself  you know why 
i like to deal
with a better class of people 
i like that 
do you rumba  samba  mambo schmambo 
  i try to tango 
  that s close enough 
kate  will you please look at your
father and my cousin dancing out there 
excuse me 
ha 
boy  this is a tough room 
  what are you doing 
  wow 
i was just practising 
in the dark 
how can you tell where the ball went 
you can t  which is probably why
you don t see a lot of night golf 
how s the party going 
i see  was it er    was it that bad 
harry    just by looking at me 
would you say that i was lower class 
middle class or upper class 
  you re being serious 
  yes 
i would say    middle 
upper maybe  middle upper 
definitely 
so what are you  i mean  at home 
when you re not doing the caddy thing 
well  at home we happen to be
upper lower 
but when i m away at school
i like to pretend i m lower middle 
but what i aspire to become
is middle middle 
you re obsessed with class  aren t you 
i just want to fit in 
but around here it s so important
that you look a certain way 
you have the right friends
and join the right sorority 
come on  kate 
joining the right sorority   
it s not important 
  you know who you remind me of 
  who 
  my father 
  guess that s better than your mother 
attention  everyone 
it s time for our little slave auction 
remember  it s all for charity 
so let s see if we can break
last year s record of  4 500 
break out your chequebooks
and think mandlngo
while i read the list
of this year s willing slaves 
what is this all about 
it s a game they play
when they feel guilty about being rich 
they auction off
the judge or chairperson 
and you buy them  take them home and
they sweep your floor  clean your garage
and afterwards you give them lunch
and a martini and it s very civilised 
civilised  how do you do

  why not 
there s a tough dogleg
to the right up here

with the world is 
privilege  people like you who somehow
think you re better than everybody else 
here is a city full of poor people 
poor people who ve suffered 
suffered and struggled in the factories
and the slaughterhouses  for what 
so that people like you

eh  boys 
  i think i ve had enough for today 
  let s go another 18  what do you say 
chandler young 
yes 
our mutual friend
told me to meet you here 
captain tom everett  united states
marine corps  company a  retired 
i was expecting someone with a vehicle 
but not this 
well  think about it 
your objective is to surveil a target
operating in the construction business 
what could be better suited to this sort
of covert recon than a barf wagon 
  order something 
  i m really not that hungry 
typical 
might i remind you that sacrifice is
the key to the survival of your country 
or in this case  your country club 
all right 
then give me a cheese sandwich 
don t have it 
i ll have a tuna on wholewheat 
don t have it 
no 
i think you ll be ordering number six 
fiesta burrito with chilli and eggs 
just exactly what is
your military background 
oh  i had 15 years in 
covert stuff mainly 
recon  lrrps  special ops 
yeah  most of the details
of my assignments are still classified 
i can t go into it without compromising
elements of our foreign policy 
but it was mainly demolition work
of an inter personal nature 
then there was that damn
bureaucratic snafu in the nam 
i ended up in a va mental facility 
typical 
so typical 
i can then assume our friend
will be discouraged from involvement
with bushwood country club 
are we talking    discouraged   
with extreme prejudice 
i m afraid we already tried
extreme prejudice  didn t work 
no  no  no  i meant
do you want him    terminated 
the less i know about that the better 
good  that s my policy exactly 
that way  when we re captured  and they
put a 12 volt battery to our testicles 
which can  does and has happened   
we can honestly say
we re ignorant of the subject 
should we swear a blood oath on it
or something 
oh  i don t think that will be
necessary  captain everett 
ok 
from now on  in future communications 
you ll refer to me as    mr sanderson 
and i will refer to you as erm   
mrs esterhaus 
fine 
well    i guess that s it then 
  oh  mr sanderson 
  goodbye    mrs esterhaus 
my god 
  what s the matter 
  you look stunning 
thank you 
give me a minute  i ll be right back 
jack 
jack  i m in the kitchen 
jackie

did to bushwood 
i made it into a fun place 
no  you took a beautiful country club
and turned it into coney island 
it was perfect the way it was 
but you couldn t stand that  could you 
you had to make it cheap and common 
i don t believe this 
you sound just like one of them 
don t you understand 
  i want to be one of them 
  you wanna be one   
then be one of them  go ahead

then go ahead 
and don t come back here anymore 
  little bit hard on her  weren t you 
  i was hard on her 
i work like a dog all my life
so she should have everything 
and she talks to me like that 
all kids go through things like that 
they re embarrassed about their parents
or they want to be someone else 
i hope you re right 
just give her a chance  she ll be fine 
everything is perfect 
it s a perfect mess  that s what it is 
my daughter walked out on me 
just when i thought i was
doing it right  i m doing it all wrong 
just when i think i m on top
i m on the bottom again 
my daughter was right  no matter how
rich i get i m a filthy  vulgar person 
that s what i am  that s what i am 
i m trash  i m filth  i m dirt 
i m garbage  i m the scum of the earth 
i m the scum of the earth 
you can contradict me
any time you want  you know 
hm  no  no  no argument here 
i make a point never to interfere
in people s relationships 
you know  there s no mystery
to dealing with women 
women are    they re just
human beings like you and me 
they re fragile  they re sensitive 
they re responsive to   
kindness and warmth and honesty

perfect 
  good morning  mrs esterhaus 
  don t  mrs esterhaus  me  you idiot 
you blew up my rolls royce 
it s difficult  in my line of work you
learn it s the details that kill you 
just make sure that next time
there aren t any screw ups 
i m playing this man in a golf match
and i don t intend to lose 
you won t 
ok  these are six mercury filled 
steel jacketed dum dum golf balls 
feel the weight on this little sweetie 
this is a high tensile strength
titanium driver 
which in the hands
of a trained professional
will definitely redefine
the term  handicap  
oh  yeah  look in the eyepiece 
go ahead  feel free 
i ve set up a simulation  see 
watermelon hanging from those gallows 
yes 
let s just say that that watermelon
represents the head of your problem 
all right 
ok 
now  sir  if you would please   
keep your eye on the fruit 
keep your eye on the fruit 
keep your eye on the fruit 
  good 
  good 
  good 
  good 
it s better than good  it s gone 
now  listen 
i want to be very clear about this 
follow the match closely 
but stay out of sight 
do nothing  unless you my signal 
ok 
but should my opponent start to win
i will tip my cap 
speaking of tipping  there is the
as yet unattended to matter of my fee 
  i d like it deposited there  please 
  what s this  a swiss bank account 
it s the combination of my locker
at the greyhound bus station 
how elegant 
i hope this is the last time we have
to meet like this  mr sanderson 
my sentiments exactly  mrs esterhaus 
ladies and gentlemen 
let s get ready to rumble 
gentlemen 
these are the rules of the match 
it s a scotch twosome  each partner
hits the other partner s ball 
for those of you unfamiliar
with this type of play 
it s a little like tag team wrestling 
only you can t do this 
none of this  or this 
now  fewest strokes wins the hole 
most holes wins the match 
  fine 
  australian winter rules 
you may improve your lie in the rough if
you can roughly prove you re not lying 
if your ball goes in the water
you may go in after it 
but only if it s been 45 minutes
since you last ate 
  are you quite finished 
  not quite  no 
  largest shoe size has the honour 
  anybody beat a 12d 
  i can  but i m out of this 
  so 
  so i guess you re up 
  ok 
may the best man win 
and if that doesn t happen 
i hope jack and harry pull this off 
wish i could stay  but i got a thing 
bye 
  knock  em dead  harry 
  come on  harry 
straighten up 
yeah 
if you have to have a partner
you re the partner to have 
great 
these clubs are terrible 
here we go

swing for the fences 
he s sliced it 
stay out of the woods 
stay out of the woods 
  stay out 
  look out

one quick stroke 
i ll bounce him and be out by sundown 
easiest money i ever made 
hmm  how the hell

ok  little gopher  hey 
it s your friend tom 
i gotjunk food

cream filled pastries 
they re good 
i was just trying
to get your attention before 
come on 
they re good  huh 
very subtle  mrs esterhaus 
i read ya  loud and clear 
whoo

i think it was a big mistake
tipping that arrow head with poison 
  don t hit it long 
  gotcha 
no  no  wait  don t hit it short 
ok  right in the middle there
is where i want to go 
wait  hit it long but let it go short

excuse me  excuse me  excuse me 
you

seems that cream
always rises to the top 
doesn t it  bag boy 
well  girls  once we win this hole
this place will be back to normal 
kate  we might even be able to make it
in time for bunny s brunch 
would you excuse me 
kate  i ve decided that
you mustjoin my sorority 
and i know that the kappas
are just going to love you 
there s only one thing  would you
consider changing your name 
maybe take out the  ounian  and shorten
it to kate hart  isn t that great 
wait a second 
what is wrong with my real name 
nothing  it s just that it sounds so   
so what 
kate  you want people
to think that you belong 
i do belong    to a family 
well    if you want
my honest opinion  kate 
i think that your family s
really embarrassing 
and i m really happy
that i m not a part of it 
yeah  so am i 
what  what 
miffy  you are a stupid 
superficial  snotty little bitch 
oh  really  really  kate  oh 
whatever  what    ow 
well  jack 
i guess it s come down to this 
whoever sinks their putt wins the match 
frankly  i m not worried 
chandler  could i talk to you
for a moment 
look  i don t know much about golf 
but i do know the difference between
a 50 foot putt and a two foot putt 
it s always been my experience
to go with the guy closer to the hole 
  you re my kind of guy 
  thank you 
  can i give you some friendly advice 
  yeah  all right 
  have you tried putting with a wedgie 
  a wedgie 
yeah  oh  it s great 
all the pros are doing it 
  would you like me to show you 
  yeah 
see  what you do is you take your normal
stance  like you re putting the ball 
just like that 
you never putted with a wedgie 
  no 
  you just take your stance 
and then    this is the wedgie 
try putting with that
crammed up your crack 
pop 
pop 
i just wanted to say that
whether or not you sink this putt   
i love you 
i m really sorry i ve been acting
like such a jerk lately 
i guess that s what i get
for hanging round a bunch of fonzanoons 
i don t know what you thought 
did you think you d just walk out on me 
insult me  come back when you want 
put your arms around me  tell me
 i love you  and i ll forget everything 
yeah  that s the general idea
