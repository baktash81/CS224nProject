i stole 40
yeah it started with a twoyear bit
parole in six months
right away i got into this problem with
these two guys they tried to turn me out
so i picked up nine more
on a manslaughter beef
some other things
i was 20 when i went in
31 when i come out
you dont count months and years
you dont do time that way
what do you mean why
why you gotta forget time
you gotta not give a fuck if you live or die
you gotta get to where
nothin means nothin
ill tell you a story all about it
once there was this captain morphis
this 300lb slob
he couldnt write his name
and he had this crew of
16 or 17 guards and cons
prison groups you know crews
they would go into these cells
and grab these young guys
and bring em up to hydrotherapy
in the mental ward
gangbang
if a guy puts up a struggle they beat him
up he winds up in the funny farm and
anyway the word comes down
that i am next
and i do not know
what i am supposed to do
i uh i am scared
eleventhirty twelve the lights come on
i got this pipe from plumbing
and uh i whacked
the first guard in the shins
i go through a convict
and another convict and
anyway i get to morphis
and i whack him across the head twice
boom and then they jump all over me
do a bunch of things
i spent six months in the hospital ward
but morphis he is also fucked up good
cerebral haematoma
they pension him out  he cant walk
straight  and he dies two years later
which is a real loss to the planet earth
meanwhile i gotta go back
into the mainstream population
and i know the minute
i hit the yard i am a dead man
so i hit the yard
so you know what happens
nothin i mean nothin happens
cos i dont mean nothin to myself
i dont care about me
i dont care about nothin you know
then i know from that day that i survive
because i achieved that mental attitude
then uh see later
i worked this out
in the stone cell
what is this
that is my life
and uh nothin nobody
can stop me from makin that happen
right there that would be you
whos the old man here
that is david okla bertinneau
hes a master thief a master
and a great man
he was like a father he taught me
everything that i know about what i do
and i told him about you
did you cut these out from magazines
yeah newspapers whatever
why all of these dead people
inside you are on ice from time
you cant even die right you know
and here
here people grow they get old
they die children come after
just a cycle you know
i dont know i
yes you do you do
you dont know from one day to the next
whether youre going to be killed
go home or get busted
look i have run out of time
i have lost it all
so i cant work fast enough to catch up
