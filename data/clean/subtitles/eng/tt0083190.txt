if that slob was a penologist
i m a jet airplane pilot 
i did 11 years 
got out  what  four years ago 
what d you go up for 
i stole  40 
 40 
yeah  it started with a two year bit 
parole in six months 
right away  i got into this problem with
these two guys  they tried to turn me out 
so i picked up nine more
on a manslaughter beef 
some other things 
i was 20 when i went in 
31 when i come out 
you don t count months and years 
you don t do time that way 
what do you mean  why 
why  you gotta forget time 
you gotta not give a fuck if you live or die 
you gotta get to where
nothin  means nothin  
i ll tell you a story all about it 
once there was this captain morphis 
this 300lb slob 
he couldn t write his name 
and he had this crew of
16 or 17 guards and cons 
prison groups  you know  crews 
they would go into these cells
and grab these young guys
and bring  em up to hydrotherapy
in the mental ward 
gangbang 
if a guy puts up a struggle  they beat him
up  he winds up in the funny farm  and   
anyway  the word comes down
that i am next 
and i do not know
what i am supposed to do 
i  uh    i am scared 
eleven thirty  twelve  the lights come on 
i got this pipe from plumbing 
and  uh  i whacked
the first guard in the shins 
i go through a convict
and another convict and   
anyway  i get to morphis 
and i whack him across the head twice 
boom  and then they jump all over me 
do a bunch of things 
i spent six months in the hospital ward 
but    morphis  he is also fucked up good 
cerebral haematoma   
they pension him out   he can t walk
straight   and he dies two years later 
which is a real loss to the planet earth 
meanwhile  i gotta go back
into the mainstream population 
and i know the minute
i hit the yard i am a dead man 
so i hit the yard 
so you know what happens 
nothin   i mean  nothin  happens 
cos i don t mean nothin  to myself 
i don t care about me 
i don t care about    nothin   you know 
then i know from that day that i survive 
because i achieved that mental attitude 
then  uh    see  later 
i    worked this out 
in the stone cell   
what is this 
that is my life 
and  uh    nothin   nobody
can stop me from makin  that happen 
right there  that would be you 
who s the old man here 
that is david okla bertinneau 
he s a master thief  a master 
and a great man 
he was like a father  he taught me
everything that i know about what i do 
and i told him about you 
did you cut these out from magazines 
yeah  newspapers  whatever 
why all of these dead people 
inside  you are on ice from time 
you can t even die right  you know 
and here 
here  people grow  they get old 
they die  children come after 
just a cycle  you know 
i don t know  i   
yes  you do  you do 
you don t know from one day to the next
whether you re going to be killed 
go home  or get busted 
look  i have run out of time 
i have lost it all 
so i can t work fast enough to catch up 
and i can t run fast enough to catch up 
and the only thing that catches me up
is doin  my magic act 
but it ends  you know  it will end 
when i got this  right there 
it ends  it s over 
so i m just asking you    to be with me 
i can t   
i can t  uh   
i can t have children 
i don t fit into this 
what  so we adopt 
i m not ready  see 
and i have my life 
so i can t 
what  i mean  what is going on
in your life that is so terrific 
mine s been a mess

however  upon consideration 
i will issue a writ of habeas corpus 
thank you  your honour  i ll write up

  how you doin   marie 
this is beautiful  man 
when d you get back 
last night  late 
you make that fifth alarm 
i made the fifth alarm 
good 
  so what s to it 
  ok 
alarm system number five
is a one channel radio transmitter 
  how s it triggered 
  there s a sonic detector off the ceiling 
now  they set off the alarm every morning
when they walk in  it s tripped 
they have ten seconds to transmit
a code word to the alarm company 
now  the code word goes over the radio 
that s why there s no phone lines 
all right  i tell you what 
  you bug it 
  all right 
call joseph  have him fix you one  you go
back there and you bug  em for the word 
c mon  it s gettin  cold  oh 
this la move  you know 
it s home free for me  after it s done 
you happy 
c mon 
hey  want something to eat 
well   
i see on your application here   
by the way  you misspelled  male  
it s m a l e 
the other is what we put in postboxes 
i see you put under  employer  
 1959 to 1976  joliet state penitentiary  
yes 
you worked for the state  i take it 
  after a fashion 
  what did you do at the prison 
desks 
i spot welded desks 
and then i got promoted to shoes 
you were in charge of the shop 
lady  i was a convict  i was doing time 
  you were what 
  frank  let s go 
uh  you have to understand 
we have more applicants than children 
then why do you still have kids here 
as a kid  i would not be falling all over
myself to stay in one of these places 
we will relieve you of some of the burden 
the point is  we establish
criteria for parenting 
an ex convict compared
to other desirables   
so we ll take a kid that s not so desirable 
you got a black kid  we ll take
a black kid  you got a chink kid 
  you don t   
  no one likes older kids 
you got an eight year old black chink kid 
we ll take him 
  frank
