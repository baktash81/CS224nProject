big city  turn me loose
and set me free   
i m jerry lundegaard 
you re jerry lundegaard 
yeah 
shep proudfoot said   
shep said you d be here at 7 30 
what gives  man 
shep said 8 30 
we ve been sitting here an hour 
he s peed three times already 
i m sure sorry 
shep told me 8 30 
it was a mix up  i guess 
you got the car 
yeah  you bet 
it s out in the lot there 
brand new  burnt umber cierra 
yeah  okay 
well  sit down  then 
i m carl showalter 
this is my associate 
gaear grimsrud 
yeah  how you doing 
so  we all set
on this thing  then 
sure  jerry  we re all set 
why wouldn t we be 
yeah  no  i m sure you are 
shep vouched for you and all 
i got every confidence
here in you fellas 
i guess that s it  then 
here are the keys 
no  that s not it  jerry 
huh 
the new vehicle plus  40 000 
yeah  but the deal
was the car first 
then the 40 000  like as
if it was the ransom 
i thought shep told you 
shep didn t tell us much  jerry 
well  okay   
except that you were
gonna be here at 7 30 
yeah  well 
that was a mix up  then 
yeah  you already said that 
yeah  but it s not a whole
pay in advance deal 
see  i give you a brand new
vehicle in advance  and then   
i m not gonna debate you  jerry 
okay 
i m not gonna sit here
and debate 
i will say this  though 
what shep told us didn t
make a whole lot of sense 
oh  no  it s real sound 
it s all worked out 
you want your own
wife kidnapped 
yeah 
you   
my point is 
you pay the ransom 
what  80 000 bucks 
i mean  you give us half the ransom 
40 000  you keep half 
it s like robbing peter to pay paul 
it doesn t make any sense 
okay  see  it s not
me paying the ransom 
the thing is 
my wife  she s wealthy 
her dad  he s real well off 
now  i m in a bit of trouble 
what kind of trouble you in 
jerry 
well  that s   
i m not gonna get into   
see  i just need the money 
now  her dad 
he s real well off 
so  why don t you just
ask him for the money 
or your fucking wife  you know 
or your fucking wife  jerry 
well   
it s all part of this   
they don t know i need it  see 
okay  so there s that  and even
if they did  i wouldn t get it 
so there s that on top  then 
see  these are personal matters 
personal matters 
yeah  personal matters

watch your step  margie 
jeez  so   
jeez 
here s the second one 
it s in the head
and the hand there 
i guess that s
a defensive wound 
oh  yeah 
where s the state trooper 
back there a good piece  in the
ditch next to his prowler 
okay 
so we got a trooper
pulls someone over 
we got a shooting 
these folks drive by 
there s a high speed
pursuit  ends here 
and then this
execution type deal 
yeah 
i d be very surprised if our
suspect was from brainerd 
yeah

from his footprint  he

you see something
down there  chief 
no  i just think i m gonna barf

what now  do you think 
let s go take
a look at that trooper 
there s different
footprints here  lou 
yeah 
yeah  this guy s
smaller than his buddy 
oh  yeah 
for pete s sake 
how s it look  marge 
well  he s got his gun
on his hip there 
and he looks like
a nice enough guy 
it s a real shame 
yeah 
didn t monkey with his
car there  did you 
no way 
well  somebody shut his lights 
i guess the little guy
sat in there
waiting for his
buddy to come back 
yeah  it would have
been cold out here 
heck  yeah  you think
is dave open yet 
dave 
you don t think
he s mixed up in   
oh  no  no  i just want to get
norm some night crawlers 
did you look
in his citation book 
yeah  last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan cierra at 2 18 a m 
under plate number he put  dlr  
i figure they stopped him
or shot him
before he could finish
filling out the tag number 
so  i got the state looking for a
cierra with a tag starting  dlr  
they don t got no match yet 
i m not sure that
i agree with you 100 
on your police work there  lou 
  yeah 
  yeah 
i think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates 
 dlr  
oh 
jeez 
say  lou 
did you hear
the one about the guy
who couldn t afford
personalized plates 
so he went and changed
his name to j3l 2404 
yeah  that s a good one 
look  all s i know is  you got a
problem  you call a professional 
no  they said no cops 
they were darn
clear on that  wade 
they said   you call your cops 
and we re gonna shoot    
of course they re
gonna say that 
where s my protection 
they got jean here 
if i give these sons
of bitches  1 million 
where s my guarantee
they re gonna let her go 
well  they   
 1 million is a lot
of damn money 
  yeah  but   
  there they are  they got my daughter 
think this thing through here 
wade 
you give them what they want 
why won t they let her go 
you got to listen to me on this one 
wade 
heck  you don t know 
you re just whistling dixie here 
i m saying the cops 
they can advise us on this 
i m saying call a professional 
no  no cops 
that s final 
this is my deal here  wade 
yeah 
jean is my wife here 
i gotta tell you  wade  i m leaning
to jerry s viewpoint here 
well   
we got to protect jean  these   
we re not holding
any cards here  wade 
they got them all 
so they call the shots 
you re darn tooting

it s just hard for me to believe
you don t remember anyone calling

had some problems 
struggling with the narcotics 
some other entanglements 
currently on parole 
so 
well  associating
with criminals 
if you re the one
they talked to 
that right there would be a
violation of your parole 
would end you up
back in stillwater 
now  i saw some rough
stuff on your priors 
but nothing in the
nature of a homicide 
i know you don t want to be an
accessory to something like that 
so  you think you might remember

and this little guy s drinking 
and he says   where can
a guy find some action 
 i m going crazy out
there at the lake  
and i says 
 what kind of action  
and he says   woman action 
what do i look like  
and i says   well 
what do i look like 
 i don t arrange
that kind of thing  
and he says   but i m going
crazy out there at the lake  
and i says   yeah  but this
ain t that kind of place  
he says   oh  so i get it  so you think
i m some kind of jerk for asking  
only he don t use
the word  jerk  
  i understand 
  then he calls me a jerk 
says the last guy thought
he s a jerk is dead now 
so  i don t say nothing 
he says   what do you
think about that  
and i says   well  that don t sound
like too good a deal for him  then  
you got that right 
yeah  he says   yeah 
that guy s dead 
 and i don t mean of old age  
and then he says   jeez  i m going
crazy out there at the lake  
white bear lake 
yeah  well  at ecklund and swedlin 
that s closer to moose lake 
so i made that assumption 
sure 
anyway  he s drinking
at the bar 
so i don t think
a whole great deal of it 
but then mrs  mohra  she heard
about the homicides down here
and thought i should call
it in  so i called it in 
end of story 
well  what d this guy
look like  anyways 
oh  he s a   
little guy 
kind of funny looking 
in what way 
just in a general kind of way 
okay  well  thanks a

you re right 
it s probably nothing 
but thanks for calling her in
