im as useless as a memory
the day before it came to me
to save your town
of stitches and stones
but once in my life
i was the king of earth
once in my life
i was
now that the stars
are frozen in their places
now that our hope seems gone
now that the stars
have fallen from our faces
i will see you on
ill never be your picture president
but i hope you got the rose i sent
to save your town of stitches and bones
im nothing more than but a simple man
formed to be american
out to draw these bridges alone
but once in my life
i was the king of the earth
once in my life
