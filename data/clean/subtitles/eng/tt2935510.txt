reporter  in what has become
known as  the surge    
a series of destructive
electrical storms
has wreaked havoc
across the globe   
and scientists are concerned
we ve not seen
the last of them yet 
their origin  outer space 
the cause  unknown so far   
 beeps 
commander  this is a message
from spacecom 
in light of
the recent catastrophe   
your attendance
is required for a debrief   
to be held in building 91 
vandersteen base 
please note  this meeting will
be classified  top secret  
roy  how are you  thanks for coming in 
appreciate it 
roy  general 
this is lieutenant
general rivas  director of
  u s  spacecom special ops 
  hi 
  sir 
  rivas  major 
stroud  adjutant general
vogel  head of security 
  major 
  ma am 
stroud  they flew
all the way in from virginia
just last night 
just to see you 
well  thank you 
your  uh  profile
is certainly very impressive 
you ve done exceptionally well
on all the assessment tests 
basic combat 
space training 
just exceptional
across the board 
the rumor is that
your pulse rate
has never gone above 80   
in any of the spacewalks 
skywalks 
and even on
this most recent fall 
is that correct 
well  so far  sir 
stroud 
that s very impressive 
according to this 
married once  no children 
yes  sir 
it s dangerous business 
as we know 
best not to
subject others to it 
fair enough 
well  we didn t
bring you in here
to talk about
your fall  roy 
we have something   
of a highly classified nature
to show you 
please have a seat  major 
yes  ma am 
rivas  what you are
about to see are
spectrogram images of neptune 
these are cosmic ray bursts 
that was taken
just 11 days ago 
it released
high energy particles   
that caused
a catastrophic power surge
all over the world 
and that s what
almost killed you 
the rays grow stronger
as they radiate towards us
here on earth 
major  what can you tell us
about the lima project 
first manned expedition to
the outer solar system  sir 
 device hums 
some 29 years ago 
as you know 
rivas 
and the commander was   
he was my father  sir 
the ship disappeared
approximately 16 years
into the mission 
no data was ever recovered 
deep space missions
were halted after that 
yes  that s him 
can you tell us how you
handled your father s absence 
well   
my mother was
certainly distressed by it 
uh  she was quite ill
at the time 
but he was 
uh  committed to his job   
and i m sure it was very
difficult for him as well 
stroud  roy   
we have something that might
come as quite a shock to you 
we believe your father
is still alive near neptune 
where exactly 
we do not know 
now  we ve sent out
numerous drones 
but obviously 
it s a vast area to cover 
my father s alive  sir 
we believe so 
stroud  roy  the surge
seems to be the result
of some kind
of anti matter reaction 
now  the lima project was
powered by that material   
and your father
was in charge of it 
now  we re talking about
a potentially unstoppable
chain reaction here 
the uncontrolled release
of anti matter   
could ultimately threaten
the stability of
our entire solar system 
all life could be destroyed 
major  we would
like you to send
a personal message on mars
by secure laser   
to what we hope
is the lima project 
the text of your message
would be prepared in advance 
of course 
mars  sir 
i m going to mars 
it is the last secure hub
we have 
stroud  roy 
we need to find out
just what
we re up against here 
our underground mars base
was the only one
unaffected by the surge 
and we believe
a personal plea 
from you to your father 
might elicit a response 
we can track that signal   
locate him and figure out
a way to stop this 
what is happening out there is
a crisis of unknown magnitude 
now  we re counting on you
to help us find him 
are you with us 
  yes  i am  sir 
  stroud  good 
you deploy first
to the moon 
our long range rockets
are stationed there
on the far side 
everything after that will be
on a need to know basis 
yes  sir 
given the magnitude
of the threat   
a cover story is being
formulated to avoid all panic 
you ll be traveling
commercially to the moon
to keep a low profile 
colonel pruitt will be your
point person from here on 
absolute top secrecy
must be maintained 
roy   are you with us  
like i have a choice 
my dad was a pioneer 
he sacrificed himself for the
search for intelligent life 
my dad was the program 
i was 16 when he left 
29 when he disappeared 
automated voice  archived
message  received 27 years   
  3 months  2 days ago 
  roy  and that s that 
clifford  roy  this is
a message from your father 
i m coming at you
from the lima project 
just on our way past jupiter
and ultimately on to neptune 
i know you have seen
that we have excited
real and enormous interest   
around the world 
and we are grateful for it 
we re doing big things
up here  real big 
namely  we re about to answer
the number one question   
when do we find all the
intelligent life out there 
and we know we will 
we re going to the edge
of the heliosphere   
where the sun s
magnetic field
won t affect
our instruments one bit 
we ll be able to examine any
star system for complex life 
never been done before 
and we sure are optimistic 
i feel your energy back home

with the subject 
colonel  for what it s worth 
i think my father s dead 
 sighs 
yeah  um   
i was a lunar astronaut
for spacecom for 31 years 
and i came to the
realization out there   
a voyage of exploration
can be used
for something
as simple as escape 
i m telling you this  roy 
because we have to
hold out the possibility   
that your father
may be hiding from us

this is an urgent update
for colonel pruitt 
thomas f   
regarding the status
of the lima project 
spacecom believes
it has detected
a possible sos signal   
from the crew
of the lima project 
the message could indicate
that commander h 
clifford mcbride   
intentionally disabled
all external communications 
under such circumstances   
the commander may
have lost all control 
if this is the case   
and communication
cannot be made
through his son on mars   
then all other efforts
must be undertaken
to destroy the commander   
and halt the surges 
this message is top secret

i m disclosing a tragedy 
here  on the edge
of our solar system 
some of our people   
have been unable to handle
the psychological distress   
of being so far away
from home 
they desired
to return to earth 
and i could not permit that 
and i have to report
the reality
that they mutinied   
committed acts of sabotage
trying to commandeer my ship 
i was forced to react
with equal severity 
i disabled one section
of our station s
life support system   
and without doubt 
i did punish the innocent
along with the guilty 
we will not turn back 
we will venture further
into space 
we will find
alien intelligence 
i am forever driven
on this quest 
 sighs 
helen  spacecom
would never allow
their image to be shattered

your father

threatens us all

on that ship 
i can get you
to the rocket
