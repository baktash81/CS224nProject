you took a life insurance policy on her
and youd cut it up with the man that killed her
oh boy i think this heats gettin
to you the way youre ramblin on
youre the one that brought it up
in your car this morning
a man doesnt always mean the things he says
you meant it
what makes you say that
cause youre a slimy bastard whod have his
wife killed to get his hands on some money
what does that make you
the slimy bastard thats gonna do it
i think youre a jealous man jake
if you cant have grace to yourself
youre not the sharing kind
i have what you call uh
a lovehate relationship with grace
you love her but you hate her
no i hate lovin her
i hate havin to tolerate the little games she plays
like fuckin half this town behind my
back and laughin at me the bitch
she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it
she just likes to fuckin torture me
goddamn it
but shes
shes my family
shes my little girl
my baby
i couldnt stand to watch her
eyes roll back in her head
as she sucks her last breath
no not me
but you
you boy you got a killin in you
okay lets say i want the bitch dead
what is it you want
how do you put a price on murder
oh well uh you know i put it at uh 50000
minus your cut of course
which is
twenty
twenty thousand no
no no no i dont have that kind of money
i mean you know
i wont get the insurance until months after shes dead
how much can you get
oh uh maybe uh 10000
thats a maybe
i need thirteen
thirteen
thats a bit much
were not talkin about buyin a car jake
were talkin about killin your wife
now its 13 or its nothin
well you drive a hard bargain
but i had a feeling you were my boy when i first met ya
well looks like we got ourselves a contract
do we shake hands
well if you cant trust the man
youve hired to kill your wife
now heres the thing
its gotta look like an accident
if it dont its no good
cause i wont get a dime and itll be
my neck thats on the choppin block
while youre livin it up somewhere
how do you want it
it cant be done at the house
it should be uh
we should talk about some money up front
oh sure
why dont i buy you a plane ticket
right outta here while im at it
oh i know you
heres what you do
you go to the house to see her
and tell her what
i dont know tell her you had to see her
you know sweet talk the woman
a young buck like you must be good like that
and then maybe shift the conversation
get her thinkin about that jeep of hers
cause she loves that thing
maybe the only thing she does love
shell wanna take you for a ride out in the desert
someplace quiet someplace deserted
ridin through the red rocks and the mesas
she loves it out there
so do i
i guess we got that in common
there wont be anybody around for
miles except the two of you
except prairie dogs thats all
and then maybe uh
well you can sweet talk her a little if you like
it makes no difference to me
put her at ease make her feel relaxed
and then uh
do it
you could leave him
its not that easy
walk away
maybe you can take chances
you can wander around like some stray wherever you please
i cant
i dont wanna be alone
i wish i was a bird
some of the old people on the reservation
used to think people could actually change into animals
i wish i could
if i was a bird i would fly to florida
disney world
i always wanted to go there
and ill fly to new york maybe
id fly to st louis and all over texas
then id fly to california
then i guess i wouldve seen it all
then i could die

a dream or two
in the afternoon light
to last you all through the years
and the only
price you pay
what are you lookin at girl
is a heart full of tears
nothing jake
absolutely nothing
going down
to lonesome town
where the broken hearts stay
goin down to lonesome town
to cry my tears
thats it
suns going down
regular people you know they go home
sit around the dinner table you know
have all this food prepared
everybody has a little setting
and they trade stories
about the day the heat
maybe laugh about a little joke something crazy they did
then they kiss sleep
wake up about two hours do it all over again
well the day was all right
we all got through it okay
you keep it
day aint over yet
night is part of day
you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark
you afraid of the dark
afraid of it boy i live in the dark
all because of a woman who made me this way
want some
people are only afraid of what they cant see
i cant see nothing so its all the same to me
kiss from a beautiful woman
lick from a dog kiss of death
its all the same to me now
so were all just floatin like sticks in a stream
just enjoy the ride
