what is it you want 
how do you put a price on murder 
oh  well  uh  you know  i put it at  uh   50 000 
minus your cut  of course  
which is 
  twenty 
  twenty thousand  no 
no  no  no  i don t have that kind of money 
i mean  you know 
i won t get the insurance until months after she s dead 
  how much can you get 
  oh  uh  maybe  uh   10 000 
that s a maybe 
i need thirteen 
thirteen 
that s a bit much 
we re not talkin  about buyin  a car  jake 
we re talkin  about killin  your wife 
now it s 13 or it s nothin  
well  you drive a hard bargain 
but i had a feeling you were my boy when i first met ya 
well  looks like we got ourselves a contract 
do we shake hands 
well  if you can t trust the man
you ve hired to kill your wife  
now here s the thing 
it s gotta look like an accident 
if it don t  it s no good 
 cause i won t get a dime  and it ll be
my neck that s on the choppin  block   
while you re livin  it up somewhere 
how do you want it 
it can t be done at the house 
  it should be  uh  
  we should talk about some money up front 
oh  sure 
why don t i buy you a plane ticket
right outta here while i m at it 
oh  i know you 
here s what you do 
you go to the house to see her 
  and tell her what 
  i don t know  tell her you had to see her 
you know  sweet talk the woman 
a young buck like you must be good like that 
and then  maybe  shift the conversation 
get her thinkin  about that jeep of hers 
 cause she loves that thing 
maybe the only thing she does love 
she ll wanna take you for a ride out in the desert  
someplace quiet  someplace deserted 
ridin  through the red rocks and the mesas 
she loves it out there 
so do i 
i guess we got that in common 
there won t be anybody around for
miles except the two of you  
except prairie dogs  that s all 
and then maybe  uh  
well  you can sweet talk her a little if you like 
it makes no difference to me 
put her at ease  make her feel relaxed 
and then  uh 
do it 
you could leave him 
it s not that easy 
walk away 
maybe you can take chances 
you can wander around like some stray wherever you please 
i can t 
i don t wanna be alone 
i wish i was a bird 
some of the old people on the reservation   
used to think people could actually change into animals 
i wish i could

disney world 
i always wanted to go there 
and i ll fly to new york  maybe 
i d fly to st  louis and all over texas 
then i d fly to california
