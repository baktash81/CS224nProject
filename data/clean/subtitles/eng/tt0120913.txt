i want you to give up everything
you have to join the mission 
where you ll face terror and torture
and possibly gruesome death 
and i would
wanna do that because     
because    it s worth it 
because    the human race needs you 
maybe you haven t
had a look around lately  but
there aren t many of us left 
at the rate we re going  they ll be
reading about us in textbooks   
  and displaying our bones
in alien museums 
  yeah  well  having your planet
blown up can have that effect on a species 
but maybe i ve been wrong all
these years  and it took your
inspiring speech to make me see it 
you ve really changed me 
it s beautiful 
i think we ve gotta hug

  gune

ahh  the broken moon
of sesharrim 
only 13 000 keks away 
  have akima lay in a course 
  we re on our way 
  what s on sesharrim  anyway  
  the gauol  an ancient race 
  great 
  this isn t a joyride  kid 
when the drej destroyed earth 
they figured life adrift in space   
would break us down 
wipe us out 
do you really want
those vile creatures to be right  
  just lay down and die  
  a little late 
about 15 years too late
to save the humans  but it s not
like we didn t have a good run 
it s not about a good run 
it s about our survival 
see  the titan was truly visionary 
the most advanced ship in the universe 
that ship has the power to reunite
the human race  to give us a home 
and the only way to find it
is in your hand 
so  you re really
counting on me  then  
  we all are 
  well 
if i don t like
the way things are going 
i ll show you how much
like my father i really am 
i ll leave 
ahh  no place to
set down on the island 
land on that coral reef 
we ll take the sled 
see if we can locate the gauol 
  preed  you and gune watch the ship 
  watch the ship  
  and keep the engines hot 
  oh  yes  they ll be nice and toasty 
  hmm 
  i m not keen on the drej catching me
with my trousers down 
welcome to planet sesharrim  cale 
  it stinks 
  hydrogen trees 
clip one of those 
and we ll be blown to steaming bits 
hello   anybody here  
we re looking
for the gauol 
now  what exactly
do the gauol look like  
don t know 
they don t get out much 
we have a kid with a map here
that you guys should know about 
i think we know
what happened to the gauol 
open fire on five 
  we ll clear a path to the sled 
everybody ready  
  one  two 
wait  no  no 
stop 
  i think they are the gauol 
ahh 
over here  
quick little devil 
  okay  all i have to do is tap
into the central computer 
and we can figure
the departure protocols 
  yes  making progress 
yes  i m making progress 
huh   wait  wait 
  hmm 
ooh  hmm 
the moon  the moon  the moon  right 
yeah  that s how we knew to come here 
my father made a map
with that moon on it 
now  why   is the ship
hidden there  
ohh 
  oh 
hmm  ahh 
it must be somewhere
in the andali nebula 
we did it  kid 
the titan is as good
as ours 
he must have been here  standing here 
right here 
  who  
  my father 
go  
let s move it  
we ve gotta
get to the beach  
  akima  
  why aren t they shooting at cale  
  they want him alive

preed  come in  
preed  where are you  
  hold on  
  preed  come in  
  preed  
preed  preed  preed   aren t you
supposed to be watching for the drej  
yes  caveman  that s right 
drej bad  we good 
  now  go look at
something shiny for a while 
  how s this  
  well  you d better look again  
drej  
  aah  
captain  we re on our way 
where are you  
we re in the
hydrogen trees being chased by the drej 
  see if you can spot them  quick  
  look there  
  akima  
  hang on  
nice move 
get down  
come on 
show yourselves 
  get down

whoa  
preed  look  
there they are  
oh  no

don t shoot  
don t shoot  
they ve got cale  
gune  calculate their trajectory 
stith  take weapons 
  let s get on it  people 
  oh  nice job covering our butts  preed 
  you re the weapons expert 
  what were you doing   taking a nap  
enough   okay 
the drej took cale 
but they are not
gonna get away with it 
well  let s quit running
our collective mouths and go get him 
our only chance to locate them
is to track akima  stith  get on it 
hmm 
they re gonna use you to figure out
where the titan is 
probably just blow it up 
too  when they find it 
  yeah  well  who s to say
it would ve worked  anyway  
  who s to say it won t  
maybe korso will get
to the titan first 
why do you care so much
about that thing  
i was raised
around people 
 drifter colony bums  
i believe  is the term 
i barely remember earth  but the older
ones used to tell us about it   
so it would never
be completely lost 
no matter how hard things got 
and they were hard 
those memories
kept us going 
once  we had a home 
the titan is our chance
to find one again 
i guess that s how
i ended up here 
what are they afraid of   so what did
the human race ever do to the drej  
  it s not what we did  they re afraid
of what we might become 
  hmm 
yeah  well  looks like
we re becoming extinct 
  cale  you okay  
  akima  
cale  
  cale  
  no   stop  
leave her alone  
akima  
no  
akima s signal is
getting stronger  i think it s
coming from the slave cages 
  a drej pod  what s in it  
  a human 
  she s mine  i saw her first 
  pretty 
ah  all right 
  i ll take out the guard 
  easy  big girl 
this requires cunning and deception 
  hello

a peek at the new shipment
before they go on the market  
  you re not allowed 
  traditionally  no

i need a new slave rather badly 
  stop fidgeting  worm  
and i can t wait till auction 
i have to be on the shuttle 
i have an appointment

it has to be booked months in advance 
  you see my problem 
  hmm 
you re lying  he s not a slave 
and you re not traders 
  but 
  he doesn t carry himself
like a slave 
  look at the way he stands 
probably ex military 
  how 
akrennian traders always threaten before
they ask a favor  it s tradition 
  and your robes are made
out of bedspreads 
  ah    just out of curiosity 
did we have a plan  b   
  hmm  an intelligent guard 
didn t see that one coming 
whoa

  are you in there  
well  if it isn t the captain 
what kept you

where is he  
i  i don t know 
  what  
  well  we found them  captain 
no more heat readings 
all gone 
until they make their move 
we stay here 
  they re moving out  i think 
  now we ve got  em 
  i can t move  they ll see us 
  maybe that s exactly what we want 
a reading  
yeah  they re right in front of us

that s it 
wow  have you ever

  not a clue 
dna coding 
 mammal 
tursiops truncatus  
the bottle nosed dolphin 
these are animals 
or  or they will be 
 leopard 
papilio glaucus

i m one step
ahead of you 
  watch the ship 
i always watch the ship 
  no  this just doesn t feel right 
  i wanna go   i wanna go  
  captain said stay 
it s captain i don t trust 
hmm  you know 
you may be right  come on 
  stith here 
  stith

  yeah 
  then please tell him good bye
for me  won t you  
  what  
  gune  
  i knew it   i knew it     get out of there  
  cale  if this message has 
  dad  
if this message has been activated 
then i have died before finding you 
i hope
you can forgive me   
for breaking my promise
to see you again 
what i wouldn t give
to see you now 
i can t change the past  cale 
but i hope i can give you a future 
this ship has the power
to create a planet 
to create a new home 
your ring would have activated
the transformation sequence 
but the titan s power cells
were drained in the escape 
they are unable
to fuel the transformation 
it is up to you
to restore their power 
after that 
the procedure is simple 
  he always did talk too much 
  oh  
  ah ah ah 
korso  don t do this 
this ship is all we have left 
doesn t that mean anything to you  
sorry  kid 
world blowing up changes a man 
  look  the drej 
  see  you can t beat the drej 
no one can 
they re pure energy 
face it  cale 
you ve lost 
  actually  you all have 
captain  if you ll relieve yourself
of your firearm 
  you backstabbing 
  well  i learned from the best 
but it wasn t just the money
the drej were offering 
it was the health plan
that came with it 
they d let me live provided
i kill all of you before they get here 
they should be here shortly 
  gune   gune  
  gune  
  gune  are you all right  
  i m  i m all right f for business 
  gune 
  i ll just take a little nap   
since i m so  very sleepy 
ahh 
  preed  you can t trust the drej 
  akima 
oh  stop   there s nothing more
tiresome than last minute heroics  
  captain   mm  oh 
  hide  n  seek  is it  
or should we play   
search and destroy  
  preed  
  ah  
  give me the ring 
  aw  you re not gonna shoot me  kid 
  cale  
  ah  aah

  korso  
  cale   the drej  
  you okay  
  yeah 
  let s not panic 
  we ve gotta get out of here
before the drej arrive 
  no  i think we re gonna stay right here 
  right here is about to be blown apart 
  this could be a good thing  wait 
  come on  cale  
wait 
we can make this work 
  what did korso say about the drej  
  that you can t beat them 
right  
because they re pure energy 
if i can reroute the system to use drej
energy  that would start the reactor 
the energy relays are linked to these
circuit breakers  so this should do it 
  yes  
  are you sure this will work  
come on  
i can fix this  
i need to get outside 
can you and stith cover me  
i  i just need a little time

  ohh  oh  oh  
  ohh  oh  oh  oh  
  ohh  oh  oh  
  ohh  oh  oh  oh  
  take the path
of least resistance  
  into the great unknown  
  no directory assistance  
  now you re on your own  
  but if you re looking
for a new world  
  just open up your eyes  
    because it s not quite paradise  
    no  
  but it sure feels like home  
  not quite paradise  
  and we can rent to own  
  it ll be all right  
  no  it s not quite  
  paradise  
  tomorrow s an illusion  
  and yesterday s a dream  
  today is absolution  
  but you gotta let it be  
  and if you re looking
for the answer  
  it s right before your eyes  
    although it s not quite paradise  
    no  oh  no  oh  
  but it sure looks like home  
  not quite paradise  
  and we are not alone  
  it ll be all right  
  no  it s not quite  
  paradise  
  somewhere
from the edge of time  
  when the poets gather
words don t rhyme  
  i ll call you up and say  
  we made it okay  
  somewhere
in the back of your mind  
  when you see your demons
come to life  
  and the world
just fades away  
  you know it s okay  
  ohh  oh  oh  
    ohh  oh  oh  oh  
    it s gonna be okay  
  ohh  oh  oh  
  ohh  oh  oh  oh  
    okay  
    oh  oh  oh  
  oh  oh  oh  oh  
    okay  
    oh  oh  oh  
  oh  oh  oh  oh  
    but it s not quite paradise  
    oh  no  
  but it sure feels like home  
  not quite paradise  
  we ll make this place
our own  
  not quite paradise  
  we can rent to own  
  not quite paradise  
  we don t have to be alone  
    not quite paradise  
    no  no  
    no  no  no  no  
    not quite paradise  
    no  no  yeah  
    not quite paradise  
  now we ve traveled far  
  but are we any nearer  
  there s a feelin
