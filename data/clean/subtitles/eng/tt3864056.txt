as i was to see her 
same beautiful pale blue eyes 
everything would ve turned out belter
if she had lived 
as it was  she died when i was a kid 
and when i lost her   
i lost sight of any landmark
that might ve led me some place happier 
you see  her death was my fault 
everybody used to tell me
that it wasn t 
that it was a terrible accident 
which is all perfectly true 
and i don t believe a word of it 
it was my fault 
just like everything
that s happened since 
the painting 
the painting 
all my fault 
i lost something
that should have been immortal 
i didn t mean to do it 
because what i ve done cannot be undone 
it doesn t matter that i m going to die 
but for all time   
for as long as history is written   
that painting
will be remembered and mourned 
as best we can tell   
he made his own way back
to his mother s apartment
from the museum 
he waited there for her all night
to come back and when she didn t 
he rang the emergency number
they were showing on tv 
when they realized his age 
they alerted us 
i don t know if you re aware 
but theo s father left the family
about six months ago 
i wasn t aware 
my son and theo were friends
in elementary school 
to my knowledge  they haven t seen much
of each other for a while 
i m afraid i don t quite understand 
uh  right now   
he is a minor child
in need of temporary emergency care 
when we asked theo
if he could think of anyone
that might be able
to help for a while 
he suggested you 
come in  come in 
i m afraid andy isn t up yet 
you can rest here if you like 
let s get you squared away 
0h  here we are 
you ll be   
you ll be feeling awfully rough 
hell of a thing to happen 
good lord 
in the circumstances 
i wouldn t see the harm in pouring you 
what my father used to call a minor nip 
if you should want some 
chance 
which of course you don t 
quite unsuitable 
we re perfectly happy
to have you  theo 
i hope you ll make yourself
as comfortable as you can 
what s happening 
shh  that s theo 
his mom passed away 
someone to see you  theo 
wow 
disturbing 
yeah 
no  apparently no one
has any idea where he is 
he wasn t paying child support 
he leftdebts  he more or less
flew town without a word 
i don t think we had a choice 
we couldn t very well turn the boy away 
no  just for a few weeks 
do you sail  theo 
no  sir 
that s a pity 
andy had the most outstanding time
at his sailing camp
up in maine last year 
they were the worst two weeks
of my life 
nonsense 
you lack confidence  that s all 
would you like me to ask etta
to make you something else to eat  theo 
i m not hungry 
thank you 
where s his dad 
good question 
oh  my god 
try this on  theo 
it s an old one of platt s 
it s so cold outside 
outside 
i think you should
go back to school next week 
the sooner we get back
to a normal routine the better 
keeping busy is the only thing for it 
perhaps you could go this afternoon 
to your apartment 
i could come with you 
i meant to clean up
while i was waiting for her 
you get what you need 
i ll tidy this up 
just your school things 
the rest can wait 
also  basketball practice
has been moved to 4 00 on thursday 
tickets for next week s lacrosse final
are available in the admissions office 
go vikings 
hey  tom 
hey 
i heard and all 
yeah 
yeah  tough luck 
that really bites 
the only reason
we were at the museum
was because my mom was bringing me in
to see the principal 
about the cigarettes 
yeah  my mom blew up
over that shit  too 
so  uh  i got to go 
later 
where are you going 
  creep lo 
  loser 
i m going to go swimming every day 
you can t swim by yourself 
you re not allowed 
everyone s going to swim 
the cure for anything is salt water 
greatest gift my father ever gave me
was the sea 
the love for it 
the feel 
what s he going to do while we re away 
who s the artist i like  samantha 
with the grand skies 
maxfield parrish 
maxfield parrish 
that s the one  great towering clouds 
when i was a boy on the water 
skies just like that  magical 
red and orange sunsets 
arcadian 
best to leave that to esperenza  theo 
she s used to doing it 
and the same with your dishes 
oh 
that is a lovely ring 
is it a family thing  your   
your mother s side 
yes 
lovely  carnelian 
the intaglio 
and the engraving on the inside says   
 blackwell  
you should keep it somewhere safe 
i thought these might help 
if you take one at night 
it ll keep you from feeling scared 
it s perfectly understandable 
we all feel afraid sometimes 
we  re just trying to
build up a general picture 
little bits of the puzzle 
now  how long would you say you were
in the museum
before the first explosion 
about an hour 
look at the map 
where were you when it happened 
which room were you in 
the last one before the gift shop 
thirty two 
but your mother wasn t with you 
no 
she wanted to go back
and see a painting again 
which painting 
the anatomy lesson 
it s a rembrandt 
why didn t you go with her 
theo 
i said i d meet her in the gift shop 
what do you remember about the incident 
move  get out 
like  did you smell
anything before it happened 
i don t remember 
did you see anything unusual 
i don t remember 
anything at all 
where were you
when the blast happened  here 
or here 
i don t know 
i know all these rooms look alike 
but maybe if you could remember
where you were 
we can start
to piece this thing together 
i m not sure i see the point
in putting him through all of this 
theo hit his head 
he has some memory impairment 
nobody seems to have thought to ask
if he was hurt or not 
is that true 
all right 
aftenuards  when you came round   
did you see people 
yes 
what were they doing 
they were dead 
you told beeman
the cigarettes were mine 
i was just standing next to you 
jesus 
get up 
right  okay 
are you absolutely sure
you wanna do that 
do what 
your rook is in danger 
but i would suggest
you take a look at your queen 
sorry things are so fucked up 
she was awfully nice 
excuse me  i  uh   
he told me to bring it here 
i m hobie 
come in 
is that him 
the man who gave you the ring 
yes 
his name was welty blackwell 
he was my business partner 
he was the business  really 
handled the clients and sales 
you   
you said he gave it to you 
you mean in the gallery  after 
i m glad he wasn t alone 
he would ve hated that 
you re the boy  aren t you 
whose mother was killed there 
have you eaten 
you like the family you re staying with 
the barbours 
it was in the papers 
about her taking you in  i mean 
orphan s plight type thing 
i ve done some work for her family
in the past 
what s your favorite subject in school 
english  i guess 
you have a favorite author 
tolkien 
edgar allan poe 
my dad says he s second rate  though 
he says he s the vincent price
of american letters 
i don t think that s fair  though 
no  i don t either 
and where is he in all this  then 
your father 
oh  i don t know 
he ditched us 
good riddance 
he could be okay sometimes  i guess 
he used to be an actor 
and when we watched movies 
he used to tell me how they did
the special effects and all 
but he drank 
like sometimes when he picked me up
from school and   
anyway  he s gone now 
well  you ve pitched up
with an interesting family anyway 
now all that remains
is a handful of paintings 
the goldfinch is one of them 
it had to live
its whole life like that 
trapped 
is she here 
pippa 
this is theo 
he wants to say hello 
not too long  pigeon 
you need to rest 
i know you

i didn t remember my room
when i came home 
what s your favorite piece of music 
beethoven 
you look like somebody
who listens to beethoven

john singleton copley 
a great colonial portrait painter 
it was my grandmother s 
she loved it  too 
this option two or three 
three 
okay 
and now 
how about this is choice five
or choice six 
six 
why can t she listen to music 
she can  sometimes 
it just tends to upset her 
she thinks she has to practice 
prepare a piece for school 
they say that she could play
on some amateur level one day   
but so many changes 
her aunt is taking her to texas 
i thought she lived here 
well  she did 
welty was her uncle
and her legal guardian 
after her mother died 
but now 
margaret is pippa s nearest relative 
blood  anyway 
and she thinks
she d be better off with her 
what s she like 
she seemed nice  i guess 
she said she s got horses
and a swimming pool 
i don t ride 
do you 
no 
my mom did 
she used to have horses
growing up in kansas 
there was this one 
used to get so lonely

you can help me sort through
these cherrywood veneers 
looking to match the case
for this clock here 
theo  you remember platt

mother loves platt the best 
daddy loves kitsey best 
mother loves platt

i can t tell 
well  one way is to check the wear 
if it s too even  like here 
then it s reproduction 
antiq ues always wear asym metrically 
anotherthing  here  this 
it s machine cut 
you feel it 
hmm 
but here   
hand planed 
so this one is fake 
well  no  it s only fake if
you try to pass it off as an original 
this is a reproduction 
and not a very good one 
there are things you can do
to help the reimaginlng 
period wood  acid  gold size  lampblack 
you can rust old nails in salt water 
you ll get a feel for it 
the new one s flat  it s dead 
but this one   
that glow 
that s hundreds of years
of being touched  used 
that s life 
what do you know about texas 
you can t walk anywhere
and they have the death penalty 
but it ll be better for her there 
the climate is good for convalescents 
she should go to the planetarium 
although it s inferior to the hayden

i socialize with people i can t stand 
i m relaxed   
personable 
i don t indulge in self pity 
it is true what i read 
we  re so accustomed
to disguise ourselves to others   
that in the end   
we become disguised to ourselves 
warmer 
warmer 
warmer 
yes 
really 
no  but it s so beautiful 
how would you know 
most people wouldn t 
i ve seen pieces he s worked on that
i could ve sworn
were completely genuine 
this is genuine connecticut queen anne 
but the pediment and the legs
were damaged 
so the finials and the legs
were salvaged from a different piece 
what  these 
mmm hmm 
you feel that 
yeah 
wow 
and   
here 
you feel that 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
what are we looking at 
come and see what hobie made  everett

i m gonna take these two to lunch
and then on to the airport

to see you again 
it was great to finally meet you  theo 
if you re ever in london

she was exaggerating about
the size of the flat  sort of 
i can recommend the poularde 
that s fine  thank you 
mmm hmm 
  thank you 
  very good  sir 
this is a pleasant surprise  mr  reeve 
lucius  please 
are you looking
for another piece to buy 
i want to talk about the piece
you ve already sold me 
the affleck 
  it is beautiful  isn t it 
  yes 
except that it isn t  is it 
thomas affleck  i mean 
the phoenix ornament is 
i m fairly certain about that 
but the rest of the chest is not 
antique  but unremarkable 
mr  reeve  i can assure you
that if there s been a mistake   
oh  but there has been  mr  decker 
you sold a fake to someone
who can tell the difference 
to be honest   
i am still quite new at all this 
and i am certainly not an expert
at philadelphia chippendale 
here s the problem 
i know exactly who put the little
frankenstein s monster together
that you sold me 
your partner 
my partner had nothing to do with this 
oh  i think he did 
i ve seen his handiwork before 
 changelings  
that s what he calls  em  isn t it 
a pair of finials from here 
a set of legs from there 
just enough of a genuinely collectible
piece to fool the buyer  and voila  
i m happy to buy the piece
back from you  mr  reeve 
at a premium 
i don t see what else i   
  i know you 
  what 
i ve been in this business
for a long time 
we all know poor hobie was going under 
swimming in debt 
then along you come  the wunderkind 
the knowledgeable 
charming young salesman 
suddenly the business is thriving 
but i know you  mr  decker 
i know all about you 
theo 
it s platt 
platt barbour 
platt  good lord 
long time  how are you 
how s andy 
you know how daddy had   
they used to call it
 problems with his nerves  
bipolar 
i didn t know 
he was always very kind with me 
yeah 
a few years back 
he came off his medication 
you know how he loved sailing 
he decided to go out
off the northeast harbor 
iwent with him 
andy came too  just in case
daddy got storm giddy  you know 
of course  andy didn t wanna go 
he always hated the water 
anyway  the wind blew up
and we were trying
to reef the mainsail   
and daddy started just   
shouting all this poetic bullshit 
next thing  he s overboard 
and we re trying to haul him back in 
and we get broadsided 
this big wavejust   
and they both went 
andy hadn t tied hisjacket on properly 
he was always such a fucking klutz 
god  platt 
do something for me 
she s back here 
we re very informal now 
mom  i ve got a guest for you 
mrs  barbour

mrs  barbour

i don t need to tell you about loss 
hmm 
you were always

but she s gone 
she s always gone

and that s why we went into the museum 
it was my fault she died 
and now she won t see me 
swim  potter

uh huh 
i have to find my mother 
hobart and blackwell 
ring the green bell 
clear on the side 
it s just me  potter 
potter 
sleep  sleep  potter  shh 
theo  you got a minute 
sure  what s up 
you know i said i d had a good year 
well  i m looking
to make some big changes 
a buddy of mine
is opening up a restaurant 
wow  that s great 
yeah  it s a great opportunity 
but  you know  it s just  well 
restaurant taxes  liquor license taxes 
it s a big initial outlay 
oh  well  if you need the money
from the savings account  you can   
the   
right  no  i  uh   
right 
i appreciate that  pal  i do 
but what i need you to do is   
i need you to call this guy bracegirdle 
your mom s attorney 
there you go 
i ve written everything out 
you tell him that i m sending you
to a private school 
and you need this amount
transferred to this account 
 65 000 
as long as the money s being used
for your benefit  it s legal  right 
and this restaurant 
it ll be for all of our benefits 
thing is  if we angle this right 
you know  we could save  like  30 000 
but why   
theo  i don t have time
for this right now 
and if you need to sign documents 
you tell him
to fax to this number  okay 
but why do i have to do it 
i mean  it   
hey  you re gonna do this  all right 
you ve got to 
i m in a real fucking tight spot here 
do you understand that 
you got it  just a temporary thing 
i mean   cause this opportunity    hey 
this opportunity could go away 
if i don t get on it right now 
stop

i ve had no way of getting in touch
with you directly 
i wanna go to private school 
did my mother leave me some money 
not exactly 
but you do have a 529
which can be used for your education 
so  if  asked you to send me  65 000 
i m afraid
the funds can only be released
directly to the school of your choice 
it was setup by your mother to ensure
it could only be used
for your education 
i don t know it  should tell you this 
but an unauthorized person
has twice tried
to make a large withdrawal
on the account 
someone with access
to your social security number 
purporting to be your attorney
out there

cheers 
i hope you don t
already have this 
no  you ll never ever believe this 
but i saw this show in boston
when i was in college 
is that that boy  longstreet 
forrest longstreet 
he was in andy s class  wasn t he 
that s right 
he didn t invite andy
to a birthday party  i remember 
i don t think
andy would ve wanted to go 
perhaps not 
you knew him better than i did 
i don t think i ever saw him for   
forwhat he was 
i think i was always trying to
make him into someone else 
after he d gone   
i thought
everything would be broken forever 
and then you came back 
and i thought
i d never be quite so happy ever again 
i hope you don t mind
if i speak from the heart   
but i always did think of you
as one of my own 
i know this must have been
distressing for you 
so i d like to offer you
some compensation 
say  an additional 10 000 
i know you were there 
room 32 
i know you were there 
and i know what else was in that room 
i don t know what you re talking about 
the metropolitan museum 
the day of the bombing 
i don t wanna talk about that 
my mother died in that explosion 
i know she did 
welton blackwell died too  in room 32 
you know  if your partner
hadn t gone around telling half the town
how you turned up at his door
with welty s ring 
i might never have made the connection 
what connection 
the connection
between you and the painting 
the painting you brought to mr  hobart 
who subsequently made you his ward 
  i m not his   
  0rwhatever you are to him 
the painting
you two have been farming out 
using it to raise money 
this painting 
fabritius  the goldfinch 
destroyed in a mindless terrorist attack
on a new york museum 
oh  poor  brave little bird 
lost forever 
you ve been irresponsible enough 
letting those street thugs
handle something so delicate 
what i m suggesting is   
you sell it to me for  say   
half a million dollars 
otherwise  i m sure the police
would be quite interested   
what the fuck
does this have to do with me 
all right 
the fbi received a tip
that a criminal gang in miami
was using the painting as collateral
in a drug deal 
but that proves that it didn t burn
in the explosion  wouldn t you say 
i would advise you
to think about my offer 
i am quite prepared to go to the fbi 
be my guest 
whenever you d like to talk about
the other matter  call me 
kitsey s not here  theo 
i thought she d be back
from work by now 
she s not answering her phone 
i don t know when she ll be back

please don t 
i m sorry 
i saw you 
oh 
you don t mean tom gable  do you 
he s an old friend 
please  kitsey  no more secrets 
i didn t think it would matter
until the wedding 
itried to break things off
a while back  but   
but you love him 
i don t expect you
to know what it feels like
to be in love with the wrong person 
theo   
does it really matter
as much as all that 
you know it doesn t 
not really 
i know about your things 
my things 
take all the drugs you want 
i don t care 
this marriage makes sense 
mommy loves you so much 
it s a good match 
we like each other and we get on 
head not heart 
if you like 
 2  000 
reilly and britton  of course 
first edition  first printing 
as you can see  in beautiful condition 
i ll take it 
for yourself 
no  a gift 
lucky person 
oh 
look at this 
stored in some unheated shed
in watervliet 
it s amazing it survived at all 
but look at the grain  though 
what 
i didn t want to bother you 
bother me with what 
this guy reeve  lucius reeve   
i sold him the chest on chest
with the affleck ornament 
and 
i sold it as an affleck 
i should have never  never 
but i didn t know what to do 
we had the irs calling every other day 
and now he s got it in for us 
well  give him the money back 
i ve tried  i don t know what he wants 
dealers live by their reputation  theo 
it s an honor system 
if word got out that   
i ll put it right  hobie 
i ll offer him more than what he paid
for the piece 
i m sure he just wants money 
hobie 
pippa 
hello  lovely 
are you gonna change the sign 
no 
i didn t ask him to 
i know you didn t 
but hobie s always saying
you ve turned things around

and you re getting married 
yeah 
it was all pretty fast 
well  i guess when you know  you know 
okay  i m bushed 
time for bed 
night 
i remember the feeling of 
 who is this guy  
that each voice is so clearly etched
in the eloquence 
with which he was able to play
the left and the right hands 
so they sounded almost like
it was a duet played with yourself 
im sorry 
i thought you d like it 
i loved it 
it just reminded me of that world 
it was really hard  you know 
you just practice  practice  practice 
six hours a day 
and then everything stopped that day 
now i can t even go
to a concert 
and welty   
you know  he was only with me that day
because i was making him take me
to an audition 
it was my fault  thee 
come home 
home here 
yes 
what about everett 
when i was with welty   
when he gave me this ring   
something happened between us 
like the way he guided me to the shop 
the minute i was there  it felt right 
and antiques 
why would i be interested 
who would ve known that 
but i was 
it s like he sent me
exactly where i needed to be 
and to who i needed to be with 
pippa 
  i   
  i know 
i know 
don t think i don t 
yes 
i miss it 
new york 
but i ll tell you why i don t come back 
because at least in london   
i don t think about it   
every second of the day 
but i miss it 
i miss hobie 
and i miss you 
we are an awful lot alike  theo 
what we both went through   
i don t think we can lean on each other 
if one of us went down   
the other would go with them 
theo  i m sorry

bullshit  nobody knew about it 
no one has ever   
you are a blackout drunk  potter 
you showed me it 
at thanksgiving  totally wrecked 
you unwrapped it and showed me 
and i wanted it  but not to sell 
iswearto you 
you cannot sell something like that 
i don t believe   
i don t believe one word you re saying 
this is the back of the painting 
the verso prove that we have it 
the painting was used
as collateral on certain deals 
until miami 
and i swear to you  potter  i swear   
what are you    wait  potter 
please  stop 
move  get out 
he came to see me today 
reeve 
he had photocopies  bills of shipping 
dozens 
all right  listen   
i wanted to tell you 
i was just trying to settle some debts 
i didn t know how to get out from under 
no  no  you don t have to tell me 
business turning around
and it suited me   
to keep my head in the sand 
no  no  that s not what i m saying 
this is all my fault 
and i ll fix it 
that s not why he came 
is it true 
please tell me it isn t true 
hobie   
i called him a liar and threw him out 
now  tell me 
is it true 
the painting 
yes 
do you know
the history of that painting 
do you know that it was
his last painting because he died 
died in an explosion  a stupid accident 
and one of the only things
that survived   
like a miracle   
was that little bird 
like nothing
that had been painted before 
and somehow  miracle after miracle 
it survives through centuries 
until you 
hobie  i never meant   
i didn t know what it was at first 
and then  i don t even know
why i kept it 
i was just trying to keep it safe 
it wasn t yours to keep 
my whole life 
everything i ve tried to do   
i don t know 
i don t know  maybe it s ignoble
to care too much about objects 
but  theo   
that painting  pulled from the fire   
passed down  saved  preserved   
so it could be handed on 
and handed   
we die 
we all die 
but to destroy  to lose something   
that should have been immortal   
is it lost 
hobie   
i never meant you any harm 
never 
cheers  happy for you two 
thank you for coming 
come over and say hi to anne 
i think she s over there by the corner 
everything okay 
the best thing that ever happened to her
is when you came along 
did your mother know  platt 
she said from the beginning 
it was just an infatuation 
women always love assholes  am i right 
we need more drinks 
oh  hi 
which one is she 
is that her 
loveliest lady in the room 
go tell your lovely lady
that you have to leave 
what are you doing here

i m going to be away for a few days 
make up an excuse for me 
are you coming back 
take care  kitsey 
before and after 
everything is before and after 
in the middle is the painting 
the one thing you did 
you crossed the border
into another country 
and now you can never go back 
you cannot sell a painting
like that  potter 
it s quickest way to get caught 
people with goods  they front you 
hold painting as collateral 
you sell the goods  you give them
their cut  painting is returned 
who 
who took the painting 
a german guy i know 
deals in stolen art 
calls himself sascha 
was involved in setting up the operation
with those miami assholes 
and then  he went missing 
now sascha is feeling heat
from fbi raid 
so he is willing to offload it for cash 
glad to see you again  potter 
  you know  that s not actually my name 
  so 
sascha is here with the painting 
victor got in touch 
said he had a buyer 
an american businessman 
and who s this american businessman 
that would be you 
you want the painting back 
yes 
yes 
i am going to do this 
i m going to make
everything right again 
40 000  my money 
this they get to keep

by the time they realize is no good 
we are long gone 
now story is   
you are based in new york 
very rich man 
is just for show 
there s someone in the back 
no one there 
right  i ll see you later 
a lot of trouble   
but worth it  yes 
yes 
merry christmas 
don t be a prick  boris 
do it over there 
care  pietersz   
known as fabritius   
born in holland in 1622 
he s only 32 years old 
but he s already considered
one of the greatest painters
in an age of great painters 
he s painting in his studio in delft
when a nearby gunpowder store
accidentally explodes 
neighbors pull a wooden panel
from the rubble   
and on the panel is painted a goldfinch 
for hundreds of years 
it is passed hand to hand 
it survives 
until me 
to have kept it shut up in the dark
all these years 
a thing made of light 
that only lived in light 
i would ve given it back 
i swear 
but it was too late 
things done that can never be undone 
things that come together 
and things that fall apart 
hey 
stop 
hey  hey  you need to walk 
yes 
all right  okay  come on 
all right 
okay 
let s go 
there he is  that s it 
come on 
the chinese boy   
maybe he runs back to sascha 
gyuri knew this place in frankfurt
that sascha used to use 
place is like fortress 
cameras  locks  pass codes and shit 
need army to get in 
or police 
eat  you should 
all right  so  problem is
police need probable cause 
gyuri has cousin 
works in very expensive bar 
now he goes to the police
and says he sees two germans arguing 
and one of them leaves behind folder 
and inside the folder 
photograph of goldfinch 
newspaper articles  and fedex envelope
with sascha s address 
next day  is like movie 
swat team
fucking breaking down the door 
i didn t see it happen  i wish i had 
to see the look on sascha s face 
being dragged out 
and yes 
it is there 
your bird 
they find it   
and it is safe 
you are welcome 
but there is more 
they find other paintings 
stolen paintings  and also   
a rembrandt 
now drink more coffee 
listen to me 
is important 
you talk about bad things you have done 
and you blame yourself 
you wish   
wish you were dead 
so we have done bad things 
but maybe sometimes
good can come from bad 
if you hadn t 
if  hadn t   
maybe none of these paintings
would be found 
maybe it s like   
huge fucking weather system
rolling over 
and we just get blown 
and maybe is fate or   
why give name 
just   
life 
eh 
your bird is safely back in the world 
happy christmas  potter 
theo   
there s too much to see 
there s the anatomy lesson 
and we should see frans hals  too 
oh 
look 
i like this one 
the dutch invented the microscope 
they wanted it
all as detailed as possible 
even the tiniest things mean something 
like that wilted leaf there 
that s the painter sending you
a secret message
