as i was to see her
same beautiful pale blue eyes
everything wouldve turned out belter
if she had lived
as it was she died when i was a kid
and when i lost her
i lost sight of any landmark
that mightve led me some place happier
you see her death was my fault
everybody used to tell me
that it wasnt
that it was a terrible accident
which is all perfectly true
and i dont believe a word of it
it was my fault
just like everything
thats happened since
the painting
the painting
all my fault
i lost something
that should have been immortal
i didnt mean to do it
because what ive done cannot be undone
it doesnt matter that im going to die
but for all time
for as long as history is written
that painting
will be remembered and mourned
as best we can tell
he made his own way back
to his mothers apartment
from the museum
he waited there for her all night
to come back and when she didnt
he rang the emergency number
they were showing on tv
when they realized his age
they alerted us
i dont know if youre aware
but theos father left the family
about six months ago
i wasnt aware
my son and theo were friends
in elementary school
to my knowledge they havent seen much
of each other for a while
im afraid i dont quite understand
uh right now
he is a minor child
in need of temporary emergency care
when we asked theo
if he could think of anyone
that might be able
to help for a while
he suggested you
come in come in
im afraid andy isnt up yet
you can rest here if you like
lets get you squared away
0h here we are
youll be
youll be feeling awfully rough
hell of a thing to happen
good lord
in the circumstances
i wouldnt see the harm in pouring you
what my father used to call a minor nip
if you should want some
chance
which of course you dont
quite unsuitable
were perfectly happy
to have you theo
i hope youll make yourself
as comfortable as you can
whats happening
shh thats theo
his mom passed away
someone to see you theo
wow
disturbing
yeah
no apparently no one
has any idea where he is
he wasnt paying child support
he leftdebts he more or less
flew town without a word
i dont think we had a choice
we couldnt very well turn the boy away
no just for a few weeks
do you sail theo
no sir
thats a pity
andy had the most outstanding time
at his sailing camp
up in maine last year
they were the worst two weeks
of my life
nonsense
you lack confidence thats all
would you like me to ask etta
to make you something else to eat theo
im not hungry
thank you
wheres his dad
good question
oh my god
try this on theo
its an old one of platts
its so cold outside
outside
i think you should
go back to school next week
the sooner we get back
to a normal routine the better
keeping busy is the only thing for it
perhaps you could go this afternoon
to your apartment
i could come with you
i meant to clean up
while i was waiting for her
you get what you need
ill tidy this up
just your school things
the rest can wait
also basketball practice
has been moved to 400 on thursday
tickets for next weeks lacrosse final
are available in the admissions office
go vikings
hey tom
hey
i heard and all
yeah
yeah tough luck
that really bites
the only reason
we were at the museum
was because my mom was bringing me in
to see the principal
about the cigarettes
yeah my mom blew up
over that shit too
so uh i got to go
later
where are you going
creeplo
loser
im going to go swimming every day
you cant swim by yourself
youre not allowed
everyones going to swim
the cure for anything is salt water
greatest gift my father ever gave me
was the sea
the love for it
the feel
whats he going to do while were away
whos the artist i like samantha
with the grand skies
maxfield parrish
maxfield parrish
thats the one great towering clouds
when i was a boy on the water
skies just like that magical
red and orange sunsets
arcadian
best to leave that to esperenza theo
shes used to doing it
and the same with your dishes
oh
that is a lovely ring
is it a family thing your
your mothers side
yes
lovely carnelian
the intaglio
and the engraving on the inside says
blackwell
you should keep it somewhere safe
i thought these might help
if you take one at night
itll keep you from feeling scared
its perfectly understandable
we all feel afraid sometimes
we re just trying to
build up a general picture
little bits of the puzzle
now how long would you say you were
in the museum
before the first explosion
about an hour
look at the map
where were you when it happened
which room were you in
the last one before the gift shop
thirty two
but your mother wasnt with you
no
she wanted to go back
and see a painting again
which painting
the anatomy lesson
its a rembrandt
why didnt you go with her
theo
i said id meet her in the gift shop
what do you remember about the incident
move get out
like did you smell
anything before it happened
i dont remember
did you see anything unusual
i dont remember
anything at all
where were you
when the blast happened here
or here
i dont know
i know all these rooms look alike
but maybe if you could remember
where you were
we can start
to piece this thing together
im not sure i see the point
in putting him through all of this
theo hit his head
he has some memory impairment
nobody seems to have thought to ask
if he was hurt or not
is that true
all right
aftenuards when you came round
did you see people
yes
what were they doing
they were dead
you told beeman
the cigarettes were mine
i was just standing next to you
jesus
get up
right okay
are you absolutely sure
you wanna do that
do what
your rook is in danger
but i would suggest
you take a look at your queen
sorry things are so fucked up
she was awfully nice
excuse me i uh
he told me to bring it here
im hobie
come in
is that him
the man who gave you the ring
yes
his name was welty blackwell
he was my business partner
he was the business really
handled the clients and sales
you
you said he gave it to you
you mean in the gallery after
im glad he wasnt alone
he wouldve hated that
youre the boy arent you
whose mother was killed there

the barbours
it was in the papers
about her taking you in i mean
orphans plight type thing

tolkien
edgar allan poe

he says hes the vincent price
of american letters
i dont think thats fair though
no i dont either
and where is he in all this then
your father
oh i dont know
he ditched us
good riddance
he could be okay sometimes i guess
he used to be an actor
and when we watched movies
he used to tell me how they did
the special effects and all
but he drank
like sometimes when he picked me up
from school and
anyway hes gone now
well youve pitched up
with an interesting family anyway
now all that remains
is a handful of paintings
the goldfinch is one of them
it had to live
its whole life like that
trapped

i didnt remember my room
when i came home
whats your favorite piece of music
beethoven

john singleton copley

it was my grandmothers
she loved it too
this option two or three
three
okay
and now
how about this is choice five
or choice six
six
why cant she listen to music
she can sometimes
it just tends to upset her
she thinks she has to practice
prepare a piece for school
they say that she could play
on some amateur level one day
but so many changes
her aunt is taking her to texas
i thought she lived here
well she did
welty was her uncle
and her legal guardian
after her mother died
but now
margaret is pippas nearest relative
blood anyway
and she thinks
shed be better off with her
whats she like
she seemed nice i guess
she said shes got horses
and a swimming pool
i dont ride
do you
no
my mom did
she used to have horses
growing up in kansas
there was this one
used to get so lonely
he would come and put his head
through the window

a cup of coffee around this place
go back to your room
ghance just

mother loves platt the best
daddy loves kitsey best

if its too even like here
then its reproduction
antiq ues always wear asym metrically
anotherthing here this
its machinecut
you feel it
hmm
but here
handplaned
so this one is fake
well no its only fake if
you try to pass it off as an original
this is a reproduction
and not a very good one
there are things you can do
to help the reimaginlng
period wood acid gold size lampblack
you can rust old nails in salt water
youll get a feel for it
the new ones flat its dead
but this one
that glow
thats hundreds of years
of being touched used
thats life
what do you know about texas
you cant walk anywhere
and they have the death penalty
but itll be better for her there
the climate is good for convalescents
she should go to the planetarium
although its inferior to the hayden
do you wanna go get a burger

warmer
yes
really
no but its so beautiful
how would you know
most people wouldnt
ive seen pieces hes worked on that
i couldve sworn
were completely genuine
this is genuine connecticut queen anne

very good sir
this is a pleasant surprise mr reeve
lucius please
are you looking
for another piece to buy
i want to talk about the piece
youve already sold me
the affleck
it is beautiful isnt it
yes
except that it isnt is it
thomas affleck i mean
the phoenix ornament is
im fairly certain about that
but the rest of the chest is not
antique but unremarkable
mr reeve i can assure you
that if theres been a mistake
oh but there has been mr decker
you sold a fake to someone
who can tell the difference
to be honest
i am still quite new at all this
and i am certainly not an expert
at philadelphia chippendale
heres the problem
i know exactly who put the little
frankensteins monster together
that you sold me
your partner
my partner had nothing to do with this
oh i think he did
ive seen his handiwork before
changelings
thats what he calls em isnt it
a pair of finials from here
a set of legs from there
just enough of a genuinely collectible
piece to fool the buyer and voila
im happy to buy the piece
back from you mr reeve
at a premium
i dont see what else i
i know you
what
ive been in this business
for a long time
we all know poor hobie was going under
swimming in debt
then along you come the wunderkind
the knowledgeable
charming young salesman
suddenly the business is thriving
but i know you mr decker
i know all about you
theo
its platt
platt barbour

he decided to go out
off the northeast harbor
iwent with him
andy came too just in case
daddy got storm giddy you know

he always hated the water
anyway the wind blew up
and we were trying
to reef the mainsail
and daddy started just
shouting all this poetic bullshit
next thing hes overboard
and were trying to haul him back in

this big wavejust

it was setup by your mother to ensure
it could only be used
for your education

to make a large withdrawal

i hope you dont
already have this
no youll never ever believe this
but i saw this show in boston
when i was in college
is that that boy longstreet
forrest longstreet
he was in andys class wasnt he
thats right
he didnt invite andy
to a birthday party i remember
i dont think
andy wouldve wanted to go
perhaps not
you knew him better than i did
i dont think i ever saw him for
forwhat he was
i think i was always trying to
make him into someone else
after hed gone
i thought
everything would be broken forever
and then you came back
and i thought
id never be quite so happy ever again
i hope you dont mind
if i speak from the heart
but i always did think of you
as one of my own
i know this must have been
distressing for you
so id like to offer you
some compensation
say an additional 10000
i know you were there
room 32
i know you were there
and i know what else was in that room
i dont know what youre talking about
the metropolitan museum
the day of the bombing
i dont wanna talk about that
my mother died in that explosion
i know she did
welton blackwell died too in room 32
you know if your partner
hadnt gone around telling half the town
how you turned up at his door
with weltys ring
i might never have made the connection
what connection
the connection
between you and the painting
the painting you brought to mr hobart
who subsequently made you his ward
im not his
0rwhatever you are to him
the painting
you two have been farming out
using it to raise money
this painting
fabritius the goldfinch
destroyed in a mindless terrorist attack
on a new york museum
oh poor brave little bird
lost forever
youve been irresponsible enough
letting those street thugs
handle something so delicate
what im suggesting is
you sell it to me for say
half a million dollars
otherwise im sure the police
would be quite interested
what the fuck
does this have to do with me
all right
the fbi received a tip
that a criminal gang in miami
was using the painting as collateral
in a drug deal
but that proves that it didnt burn
in the explosion wouldnt you say
i would advise you
to think about my offer
i am quite prepared to go to the fbi
be my guest
whenever youd like to talk about
the other matter call me
kitseys not here theo
i thought shed be back
from work by now
shes not answering her phone
i dont know when shell be back

i didnt think it would matter
until the wedding
itried to break things off
a while back but
but you love him
i dont expect you
to know what it feels like
to be in love with the wrong person
theo
does it really matter
as much as all that
you know it doesnt
not really
i know about your things
my things
take all the drugs you want

i sold it as an affleck
i should have never never
but i didnt know what to do
we had the irs calling every other day

hobie

im really glad youre happy theo
i cant believe i havent even met her
and youre getting married
yeah
it was all pretty fast
well i guess when you know you know
okay im bushed
time for bed
night
i remember the feeling of
who is this guy
that each voice is so clearly etched
in the eloquence
with which he was able to play
the left and the right hands
so they sounded almost like
it was a duet played with yourself
im sorry
i thought youd like it
i loved it
it just reminded me of that world
it was really hard you know
you just practice practice practice
six hours a day
and then everything stopped that day
now i cant even go
to a concert
and welty
you know he was only with me that day
because i was making him take me
to an audition
it was my fault thee
come home
home here
yes
what about everett
when i was with welty
when he gave me this ring
something happened between us
like the way he guided me to the shop
the minute i was there it felt right
and antiques
why would i be interested
who wouldve known that
but i was
its like he sent me
exactly where i needed to be
and to who i needed to be with
pippa
i
i know
i know
dont think i dont

because at least in london
i dont think about it
every second of the day
but i miss it

shut the fuck up what are you
you had stayed i would have
i would have given it back to you
i promise

but you wouldnt wait
you had to go straight away
and i was scared
to tell you that im so ashamed
still so ashamed
bullshit nobody knew about it
no one has ever
you are a blackout drunk potter
you showed me it
at thanksgiving totally wrecked
you unwrapped it and showed me
and i wanted it but not to sell
iswearto you
you cannot sell something like that
i dont believe
i dont believe one word youre saying
this is the back of the painting
the verso prove that we have it
the painting was used
as collateral on certain deals
until miami
and i swear to you potter i swear
what are you wait potter
please stop
move get out
he came to see me today
reeve
he had photocopies bills of shipping
dozens
all right listen
i wanted to tell you
i was just trying to settle some debts
i didnt know how to get out from under

to keep my head in the sand
no no thats not what im saying

and ill fix it
thats not why he came
is it true
please tell me it isnt true
hobie
i called him a liar and threw him out
now tell me
is it true
the painting
yes
do you know
the history of that painting
do you know that it was
his last painting because he died
died in an explosion a stupid accident
and one of the only things
that survived
like a miracle
was that little bird
like nothing
that had been painted before
and somehow miracle after miracle
it survives through centuries
until you
hobie i never meant
i didnt know what it was at first
and then i dont even know
why i kept it
i was just trying to keep it safe
it wasnt yours to keep
my whole life
everything ive tried to do
i dont know
i dont know maybe its ignoble
to care too much about objects
but theo
that painting pulled from the fire
passed down saved preserved
so it could be handed on
and handed
we die
we all die
but to destroy to lose something
that should have been immortal
is it lost
hobie
i never meant you any harm
never
cheers happy for you two
thank you for coming
come over and say hi to anne
i think shes over there by the corner
everything okay
the best thing that ever happened to her
is when you came along
did your mother know platt
she said from the beginning
it was just an infatuation
women always love assholes am i right
we need more drinks
oh hi
which one is she
is that her
loveliest lady in the room
go tell your lovely lady
that you have to leave
what are you doing here
i have a ticket for you
but we must go now
why the fuck would i go to amsterdam
cause you want it back
ill find you later okay
yes
oh there you are
you must meet my godmother
anne de larmessin
what are you doing
hmm
im going
you cant theres more photographs
im going to be away for a few days
make up an excuse for me
are you coming back
take care kitsey
before and after
everything is before and after
in the middle is the painting
the one thing you did
you crossed the border
into another country
and now you can never go back
you cannot sell a painting
like that potter
its quickest way to get caught
people with goods they front you
hold painting as collateral
you sell the goods you give them
their cut painting is returned
who
who took the painting
a german guy i know
deals in stolen art
calls himself sascha
was involved in setting up the operation
with those miami assholes
and then he went missing
now sascha is feeling heat
from fbi raid
so he is willing to offload it for cash
glad to see you again potter
you know thats not actually my name
so
sascha is here with the painting
victor got in touch
said he had a buyer
an american businessman
and whos this american businessman
that would be you
you want the painting back
yes
yes
i am going to do this
im going to make
everything right again
40000 my money
this they get to keep
that way they dont look so close
at bank draft
by the time they realize is no good
we are long gone
now story is
you are based in new york
very rich man
is just for show
theres someone in the back
no one there
right ill see you later
a lot of trouble
but worth it yes
yes
merry christmas
dont be a prick boris
do it over there
care pietersz
known as fabritius
born in holland in 1622
hes only 32 years old
but hes already considered
one of the greatest painters
in an age of great painters
hes painting in his studio in delft
when a nearby gunpowder store
accidentally explodes
neighbors pull a wooden panel
from the rubble
and on the panel is painted a goldfinch
for hundreds of years
it is passed hand to hand
it survives
until me
to have kept it shut up in the dark
all these years
a thing made of light
that only lived in light
i wouldve given it back
i swear
but it was too late
things done that can never be undone
things that come together
and things that fall apart
hey
stop
hey hey you need to walk
yes
all right okay come on
all right
okay
lets go
there he is thats it
come on
the chinese boy
maybe he runs back to sascha
gyuri knew this place in frankfurt
that sascha used to use
place is like fortress
cameras locks passcodes and shit
need army to get in
or police
eat you should
all right so problem is
police need probable cause
gyuri has cousin
works in very expensive bar
now he goes to the police
and says he sees two germans arguing
and one of them leaves behind folder
and inside the folder
photograph of goldfinch
newspaper articles and fedex envelope
with saschas address
next day is like movie
swat team
fucking breaking down the door
i didnt see it happen i wish i had
to see the look on saschas face
being dragged out
and yes
it is there
your bird
they find it
and it is safe
you are welcome
but there is more
they find other paintings
stolen paintings and also
a rembrandt
now drink more coffee
listen to me
is important
you talk about bad things you have done
and you blame yourself
you wish
wish you were dead
so we have done bad things
but maybe sometimes
good can come from bad
if you hadnt
if hadnt
maybe none of these paintings
would be found
maybe its like
huge fucking weather system
rolling over
and we just get blown
and maybe is fate or
why give name
just
life
eh
your bird is safely back in the world
happy christmas potter
theo
theres too much to see
theres the anatomy lesson
and we should see frans hals too
oh
look
i like this one
the dutch invented the microscope
they wanted it
all as detailed as possible
even the tiniest things mean something
like that wilted leaf there
thats the painter sending you
a secret message
