come on  right 
right  here we go  mr  dillon 
give us strength 
o lord  to endure 
we recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry god 
let the circle be unbroken   
   until the day 
amen 
amen 
thank you  gentlemen 
this is rumour control 
here are the facts 
as some of you know 
a 337 model e e v    
   crash landed here at 0600   
   on the morning watch 
there was one survivor 
two dead and a droid that was
hopelessly smashed beyond repair 
the survivor is a woman 
that s what i saw 
i just want to say that i ve taken
a vow of celibacy 
so have we all 
that also includes women 
yes 
we ve all taken the vow 
shut your gob  morse 
i d like to say that i  for one 
do not appreciate company policy
allowing her to freely   
   intermingle with inmates
and the rest of the staff 
what brother means to say is we view
the presence of any outsider 
especially a woman 
as a violation of the harmony 
a potential break in the spiritual unity 
we are well aware
of your feelings in this matter 
you will be pleased to know
that i have requested a rescue team 
hopefully  they will be here
inside of a week 
oh  come on 
and evacuate her a s a p 
don t give us that 
what s her medical status 
she doesn t seem too badly damaged 
she s unconscious  can t give you
a more specific diagnosis at the moment 
will she live 
  i would think so 
look  it s in everybody s interest   
   the woman doesn t come
out of the infirmary   
   until the rescue team arrives 
and certainly not without an escort  right 
sir 
gentlemen  we should all stick
to our set routine   
   and not get unduly agitated 
right 
correct 
all right 
thank you  gentlemen 
all right 
better get here soon
or there ain t gonna be much left 
what s that 
it s just a little cocktail of my own mix 
sort of eye opener 
you a doctor 
my name is clemens 
i m the chief medical officer here 
here 
fury 161 
it s one of weyland yutani s
backwater work prisons 
it grieves me to say 
do you mind 
this is basically a stabilizer 
i really ought to shave your head 
we have a big problem with lice here 
and when you re feeling better 
i ll give you some clippers 
and you can tend to
your private parts yourself 
how d i get here 
you crash landed in an e e v 
evidently separated from your mother ship
before you hit our atmosphere 
you have any idea
how long you were in hypersleep 
 cause coming out the way you did
can be quite a jolt to the system 
yeah  i ll be sick for a couple of weeks 
indeed 
where are the others 
  they didn t make it 
what 
  they didn t survive 
i have to get to the ship 
have to get to the ship 
  you re in no condition for that 
you want to get me some clothes 
or should i just go like this 
given the nature of our
indigenous population 
i would suggest clothes 
none of them have seen a woman in years 
neither have i  for that matter 
this used to be a 5 000 convict facility 
but it s been reduced
to a custodial staff of 25 
why 
keep the pilot light on 
the pilot light for what 
blast furnace  natural methane 
we have a foundry 
lieutenant ripley 
the inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containers 
how do you know my name 
it s stencilled on the back of your shorts 
release the cable 
where are the bodies 
we have a morgue 
we put them there
until the investigative team arrives   
   in about a week  i think 
there was a droid 
disconnected 
there were bits and pieces of him
all over the place 
we put what was left on the rubbish tip 
the corporal was impaled
by that safety support 
he never knew what hit him 
and the girl 
she drowned in her cryo tube 
i don t think she was conscious
when it happened 
um  i m sorry 
what s the matter 
where is she 
in the morgue 
i have to see her 
i have to see what s left of her 
is there any particular reason
that you re so insistent 
yes  i have to be sure how she died 
i hate to be repetitious
about such a sensitive subject 
but it is perfectly clear that she drowned 
was she your daughter 
no  she wasn t 
um 
c could i have a moment alone  please 
yes  of course 
forgive me 
what s she doing 
okay 
no 
we have to do an autopsy 
what 
i told you 
we have to make sure how she died 
and i told you  she drowned 
i m not so sure 
i i have to see inside of her 
you re disorientated 
half your system s still in 
i have a very 
very good reason 
well  perhaps you d like to
share that reason 
possible contagion 
what kind exactly 
cholera 
  cholera 
there hasn t been a case of cholera
reported for 200 years 
please 
everything s in place 
there s no sign of infection 
no indication of disease 
chest 
open the chest 
careful 
lungs 
flooded with fluid 
ergo  she drowned 
now  since i m not a complete idiot 
would you like to tell me
what we re really looking for 
mr  clemens 
superintendent 
i don t believe you ve met
lieutenant ripley 
what s going on  mr  clemens 
that s right  sir 
what s going on  mr  clemens 
well  first    
   the lieutenant is feeling much better 
i m happy to say 
second  in the interest of public health 
i am performing an autopsy 
without my authority 
well  there didn t seem to be time 
but it s turned out all right 
there s no sign of contagion in the body 
good 
but it might be helpful if lt  ripley   
   didn t parade around in
front of the prisoners 
as i am told she did in the last hour 
it might also be helpful   
   if you kept me informed as to
any change in her physical status 
or would that be asking too much 
we have to cremate the bodies 
  nonsense  we ll keep the bodies on ice   
   till the rescue team arrives 
on ice 
  there is the public health issue 
the lieutenant feels that there is still
a possibility of a communicable infection 
i thought you said
there was no sign of disease 
it would appear that the child drowned 
but without the benefit
of proper laboratory tests 
it s impossible to be absolutely certain 
i would consider it unwise   
   to tolerate even the possibility
of an unwelcome virus 
an outbreak of cholera
would look extremely bad on a report 
would it not  sir 
we ve 25 prisoners in this facility 
all double y chromos 
all thieves  rapists 
murderers  child molesters  all scum 
just because they ve taken on religion
doesn t make them any less dangerous 
i try not to offend their convictions 
i don t want to upset the order 
i don t want ripples in the water 
and i don t want a woman walking around
giving them ideas 
i see  for my own personal safety 
exactly 
i will leave the details of the cremation
to you  mr  clemens 
they may use the furnace  but i want
everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours 
you called it  sir 
ah  christmas has come early  murph 
what do you mean 
any dead ox is a good ox 
  you re bloody right 
smelly bastards  all covered in lice 
there s only seven of the friggin  things left 
and then we re done with them 
god  i hates hosin  these bastards down 
i always get shite all over me boots 
talkin  of hosing things down  frank 
yeah 
you had the chance 
what would you say to her 
what do you mean 
if i got the chance 
you know 
if you got the chance 
you mean  casual like 
yeah  i mean  how would you
put it to her if you bumped into her   
   in the mess hall or somewhere 
no problem 
i ve never had any problem with the ladies 
i d say to her  good day  my dear 
how s it goin  
anything i can do to be of service 
then i d give her the look 
you know  up and down 
and i d give her the wink 
the dirty smile 
she d soon get the picture 
yeah  right 
and then she d say 
kiss my ass  you horny old fucker 
i d be happy to kiss her ass 
i d be happy to kiss her
anywhere she wants 
yeah  but treat  em mean 
keep  em keen  right  frank 
told you before  murph 
treat a queen like a whore
and a whore like a queen 
can t go wrong 
what do you think killed babe 
beats me  she just keeled over 
how old was she 
the charts say 1 1 
in her prime  never mind 
we ll chop her up later
and throw her in the stew 
right 
hey  frank 
what s this 
we commit this child   
   and this man to your keeping  o lord 
their bodies   
   have been taken
from the shadow of our nights 
they have been released   
   from all darkness and pain 
the child and the man   
   have gone beyond our world 
they are forever eternal   
   and everlasting 
ashes to ashes  dust to dust 
why 
why are the innocent punished 
why the sacrifice 
why the pain 
there aren t any promises 
nothing s certain 
only that some get called 
some get saved 
she won t ever know
the hardship and grief   
   for those of us left behind 
we commit these bodies to the void   
   with a glad heart 
for within each seed 
there is a promise of a flower 
and within each death 
no matter how small 
there s always a new life 
a new beginning 
amen 
amen 
i ll tell you  it s fucking weird 
the only one to survive
that crash is a woman 
what trouble can she cause 
she s already changed everything 
what the fuck are we supposed to do 
i  for one 
i mean it 
okay 
there s a lot of talk going around
that we ve got some disharmony here 
any you guys want to tell me
what the problem is 
come on 
speak to me  brothers 
all right  i ll tell ya 
i don t mind the dark 
i don t mind the bugs 
i don t mind wanderin  around in some
cold  wet  damp tunnel for a week at a time 
i don t mind anything 
but i mind golic 
that the way you feel about it 
yeah  the guy s crazy and he smells bad 
i ain t going out with him anymore 
you got anything to say for yourself 
well  he s going with you 
golic is just another poor  miserable 
suffering son of a bitch 
just like you and me 
 cept he smells worse 
and he s crazy 
knock off the shit 
you got a job to do 
i don t want to hear
another word about golic 
okay 
well  hello 
as i thought  mr  aaron 
as i thought 
you called it  sir 
i just wanted to  uh  say thanks
for what you said at the funeral 
it was  uh 
my friends would have appreciated it 
yeah  well  you don t wanna know me  lady 
i m a murderer and rapist of women 
really 
well  i guess i must make you nervous 
do you have any faith  sister 
  not much 
well  we ve got a lot of faith here 
enough even for you 
i thought women weren t allowed 
well  we ve never had any before 
but we tolerate anybody 
even the intolerable 
  thank you 
that s just a statement of principle 
nothing personal 
you see  we ve got
a good place to wait here 
and until now  no temptation 
what are you waiting for 
huh 
we re waiting for god to return   
   and raise his servants to redemption 
dillon and the rest
of the alternative people   
   embraced religion  as it were 
about five years ago 
tincture 
i m on medication 
hardly 
what kind of religion 
some sort of apocalyptic  millenarian 
christian fundamentalist  uh 
right 
exactly 
point is  when the company
wanted to close the facility down 
dillon and the rest of the converts
wanted to stay 
and they were allowed
to remain as custodians   
   with two minders   
   and a medical officer 
and here we are 
how did you get
this wonderful assignment 
how do you like your new haircut 
it s okay 
now that i ve gone out on a limb
for you with andrews 
damaged my already less than perfect
relationship with that good man 
and briefed you   
   on the humdrum history of fury 1 61 
can you not tell me
what you were looking for in the girl 
you attracted to me 
ln what way 
ln that way 
very direct 
i ve been out here a long time 
so have i 
in the year 7510   
   if god s a comin    
   he oughta make it by then   
   maybe he ll look around and say   
   guess it s time for the judgment 
yech 
in the year
hey  spike 
spike  spikey 
are you down there 
what are you doing 
i really appreciate your affections 
but i am aware that they   
deflected my question 
in the nicest possible way  of course 
you re spoiling the mood 
i have a job to do 
i just want to know why
we had to cremate the bodies 
and now that i m in your cot 
you think i owe you an answer 
i think you owe me an answer 
being in my bed s got nothing to do with it 
i had a terrible dream in hypersleep 
and i had to be sure what killed her 
anyway  i made a mistake 
possibly 
and now i ve made another mistake 
really  what s that 
fraternizing with a prisoner 
physical contact 
it s against the rules  isn t it 
definitely  when was this 
l think you know 
i m not a prisoner 
you have a bar code
on the back of your head 
that does deserve an explanation 
but i don t think now is the moment 
sorry  we are rather
spoiling things  aren t we 
mr  clemens 
mr  aaron 
superintendent andrews   
   would like you to report   
   to vent shaft 22
on the second quadrant  now 
we ve had an accident 
something serious 
you could call it that 
one of our prisoners has been    diced 
sorry  i have to go 
official duties 
who was it 
  murphy 
how do you know 
that s his boot 
i gave him the assignment  sir 
he was a wanker 
no apologies  mr  aaron 
it wasn t your fault 
well  not much to say  is there 
death was instantaneous 
no shit 
i take it he was pulled into the fan 
sudden rush of air 
i d imagine  except 
right 
almost happened to me once 
i ve told him so many times 
stay away from the fans 
nobody bloody listens 
except the fan was blowing 
what s that 
  i don t know 
i want to see you in my quarters
in 30 minutes  if you ll please  mr  clemens 
have you got any ideas 
here you are  you know 
wandering around without an escort   
   is really gonna piss
superintendent andrews off 
will you tell me about your accident 
one of the prisoners has been killed 
really  how 
hmm 
in the air shaft 
poor soul backed into a nine foot fan 
i found something at the accident site 
just a bit away from where it happened 
a mark  a burn 
rather like the one you found
on the girl s cryo tube 
look  i m on your side 
i want to help  but i need to know
what s going on   
   or what you think is going on 
lf you really wanna help 
find me a computer
with audio capabilities   
   so i can access this flight recorder 
we don t have anything like that here 
well  what about bishop 
bishop 
the droid that crashed with me 
i can point you in the right direction 
i can t join you 
i have a previous engagement 
this ll top you up 
golic  don t fidget 
what s all this shit 
it s not properly wrapped 
what the hell does he ever do right 
eat 
he s got that down pretty good 
golic 
you light a candle for murphy 
i ll light a thousand 
he was special 
never complained about me once 
i loved him 
is it true what they say 
his head split into a million pieces 
okay  who s got the matches 
sit down  mr  clemens 
  thank you 
sugar 
uh  no thanks 
milk 
just a little  please 
thank you  mr  aaron 
listen to me  you piece of shit 
you screw with me
one more time  i ll cut you in half 
i m sorry 
i don t think i understand 
at 0700 hours  i received word
from the network 
i may point out this is the first
high level communication   
   this installation has ever received 
to my knowledge 
they want this woman looked after 
they consider her to be very high priority 
why 
l have no idea 
but why did you let her
out of the infirmary 
this accident with murphy
is what happens   
   when one of these dumb
sons of a bitches   
   walks around with a hard on 
i m a doctor  you re the jailer 
we both know exactly what you are 
sit down 
i think it might be better if i left 
i find you   
unpleasant to be around 
you do  isn t that lovely 
consider this  mr  clemens 
how would you like me to explain
your sordid history   
   to your newfound friend 
for her personal edification  of course 
now sit the hell down 
i don t like you 
you re unpredictable 
insolent  possibly dangerous 
you question everything 
if i didn t need a medical officer 
i wouldn t let you within
light years of this operation 
i m eternally grateful 
  keep your sarcasms to yourself 
now  is there anything i should know 
about what 
about the woman 
don t play with me  mr  clemens 
you spend every second you can with her 
and i have my suspicions not all of
your concerns with her are medical 
has she said anything to you  anything   
   about where she s
from  what her mission is 
what the hell she was doing in an e e v  
she told me she was part of a combat unit
that came to grief 
beyond that  i assume it s all classified 
i haven t pressed her for more 
that s all 
that s all 
you re sure 
yes 
nothing more 
no 
get out of here 
shut up  you fuckin  bitch 
get in there 
  shut up  you bitch 
nobody s gonna hear you 
  goddamn it  let go of me 
fuck you  no 
hold still  shh  shh 
no  goddamn it 
you okay 
no  son of a bitch 
take off  i gotta re educate
some of the brothers 
we ve gotta discuss
some matters of the spirit 
cigarettes 
so let s do it 
this is like 1 0 city blocks 
how many 
this makes 1 76 
can t you chew a little quieter 
i m trying to figure out
how big this compartment is 
i can t think with all this
goddamn noise you re making 
you re not supposed to swear 
i m sorry 
now  we ve encircled
this entire compartment once 
hey 
what 
what the shit is doing that 
swearing 
shut up 
it s all right to say shit 
it ain t against god 
what the hell is going on with the candles 
must be the wind
from one of the vent shafts 
backwash from the closest circulating unit 
but if all the candles go out 
how the hell we gonna know   
   where we are 
somebody will just have to
go back and relight them 
i guess i m nominated 
watch your step  brother 
okay  who are the comedians 
wait  wait  wait 
quick  grab it  here 
  help me  help me 
go  fuckin  go 
go  go  go  quick  run 
gimme that 
get this fucking thing off me 
oh  fuck 
let me go 
hey 
ah  ripley 
hi  bishop 
how you feeling 
my legs hurt 
uh  listen  i m sorry 
it s okay 
i m just a glorified toaster 
how are you 
i like your new haircut 
bishop  can you access data
on the flight recorder 
no problem 
golic 
i m home 
what happened on the sulaco 
why were our cryo tubes ejected 
stasis interrupted 
fire in cryogenic compartment 
repeat  fire in cryogenic  what happened 
what started the fire  bishop 
can you hear me 
the fire was electrical 
lt was in the subflooring 
did the sensors pick up anything   
   moving around on the
ship prior to separation 
it s very dark here  ripley 
i m not what i used to be 
just tell me  does the recorder
indicate anything 
was there an alien on board 
yes 
is it on the sulaco or did it
come with us on the e e v  
it was with us all the way 
does the company know 
the company knows everything
that happened on the ship 
it all goes into the computer
and gets sent back to network 
and they want it 
i hurt  do me a favour 
disconnect me 
i could be reworked 
but i ll never be top of the line again 
i d rather be nothing 
you re sure 
do it for me  ripley 
it wasn t me  i didn t do it 
it was  it was the dragon 
feeds on minds  it was 
nobody can stop it 
what about boggs and rains 
they got s slaughtered like pigs 
it wasn t me 
it wasn t me 
  stark raving mad 
i m not saying it was anyone s fault 
but he should have been chained up 
you called it  sir 
mad as a fucking hatter 
keep him separated from the rest 
i don t want him causing a panic 
clemens 
sedate this poor idiot 
yeah 
not until we know about the brothers 
now  now  pull yourself together 
talk to me now 
now  where are boggs and rains 
it wasn t me 
hopeless  you re not gonna
get anything out of him 
it wasn t me 
we ll have to send out   
   a search team 
i m afraid we ll have to assume
there s a very good chance   
   this simple bastard has murdered them 
now  you don t know that 
he s never lied to me 
he s crazy  he s a fool 
but he s not a liar 
he s telling the truth 
i d like to talk to him about this  this dragon 
it was a dragon 
  you re not talking   
   to anyone  lieutenant 
i m not interested in your opinion 
because you are not
in full possession of the facts 
this man is a convicted multiple murderer 
known for particularly brutal crimes 
isn t that right  mr  dillon 
yeah  that part s right 
then i ll talk to you  lt s important 
when i have finished
with my official duties 
i will be quite pleased
to have a little chat  yes 
let me see if i have this correct  lieutenant 
it s an eight foot creature of some kind 
with acid for blood 
and it arrived on your spaceship 
it kills on sight and is generally unpleasant 
and  of course  you expect me to accept
all this on your word 
no  i don t expect anything 
quite a story  mr  aaron 
  right  sir  it s a beauty 
never heard anything quite like it  sir 
  expect not 
tell me  lieutenant 
what would you suggest we do 
well  what kind of weapons have you got 
this is a prison 
it s not a good idea to allow prisoners
access to firearms 
what keeps them from killing you 
fear  there s no way to escape 
with the arrival of the next supply ship 
the company would eliminate them 
this is a maximum security prison 
and you have no weapons of any kind 
we have some carving
knives in the abattoir 
a few more in the mess hall 
some fire axes scattered about the place 
nothing terribly formidable 
that s all 
we re on the honor system 
then we re fucked 
  no  you re fucked 
confined to the infirmary 
quarantined 
mr  aaron will escort you 
i think you ll be safe from any large 
nasty beast while you re there  right 
yes  that s a good girl 
let s all report to the mess hall 
superintendent andrews wants a meeting 
mess hall  right away  people 
isn t there any way off of this place 
some way to escape 
no  supply ship comes every six months 
and that s it 
mm hmm 
fuck 
they are sending somebody
to pick you up quite soon  i gather 
really 
what s soon 
i don t know  nobody s ever been
in a hurry to get here before 
do you want to tell me
what you and andrews talked about 
no 
you ll just say i m crazy 
that s a bit uncharitable 
how are you feeling 
not so hot 
sore throat 
sick to my stomach 
pissed off 
well  that s understandable
given the circumstances 
perhaps i should give you
one of my special cocktails 
i don t know why everybody
blames everybody for everything 
nobody s perfect  only human 
there s no such thing as a perfect human 
in an insane world 
a sane man   
   must    appear    insane 
that s very profound  golic 
thank you 
you married 
me 
you should get married 
have kids 
pretty girl  i used to know
lots of  em back home 
they used to like me 
for a while 
you re gonna die too 
are you 
what 
married 
why 
just curious 
  no 
how about levelling with me 
  could you be more specific 
when i asked how you got assigned here 
you avoided the question 
and then when i asked about the prison i d 
tattooed on the back of your head 
you ducked me again 
lt s a long  sad story   
   and more than a little melodramatic 
try me 
if you insist 
after my student years 
despite the fact that i had become   
   secretly addicted to morphine 
i was considered to be most promising 
a man with a future 
and during my first residency 
i did a 36 hour stretch on an e r 
so  i went out and i got
more than a little drunk 
then i got called back 
boiler had blown on a fuel plant 
and there were 30 casualties 
and 1 1 of them died 
not as a result of the accident   
   but because i prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller 
i got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3 c 
at least i got off the morphine 
l m sorry 
l think i was let off lightly 
did you serve your time here 
i got to know this motley crew quite well 
so when they stayed  i stayed 
nobody else would employ me 
so  do you still trust me with a needle 
magnificent 
give us strength  o lord  to endure 
we recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry god 
let the circle be unbroken
until the day  amen 
amen 
what the fuck is happening here 
what the fuck is this
bullshit that s comin  down 
we got murder  we got rape 
we got brothers in trouble 
i don t want no more bullshit around here 
now  we got problems 
we stand together 
yes  thank you  mr  dillon  all right 
once again  this is rumour control 
here are the facts 
at 0800 hours 
prisoner murphy 
through carelessness on his part 
was found dead in vent shaft 1 7 
he seems to have been
sucked into a ventilator fan 
at about 2100 hours 
prisoner golic reappeared
in a deranged state 
prisoners boggs and rains are missing 
there seems to be a good chance
that they have met with foul play   
   at the hands of prisoner golic 
we need to organize
and send out a search party 
volunteers will be appreciated 
i think it s fair to say
that our smoothly running facility   
   has suddenly developed a few problems 
i can only hope we are able to all
pull together over the next few days   
   until the rescue team arrives
for lieutenant ripley 
lt s here  it got clemens 
stop this raving at once  stop it 
  i m telling you  it s here 
aaron  get that foolish woman
back to the infirmary 
move it 
out of my way 
fuck 
we give you thanks  o lord 
your wrath has come 
and the time is near for us to be judged 
the apocalypse is upon us 
let us be ready 
let your mercy be just 
it was massive 
amen 
and fast 
l was there  i saw it 
what the fuck do we do now 
who s in fucking charge 
organize  we gotta organize  right 
right  well  i guess i m next in line 
85 s gonna be in charge 
jesus  give us a break 
don t call me that 
okay  look  there s no way
i can replace andrews 
he was a good man 
i know you guys didn t appreciate him 
aaron  we don t want to hear that shit now 
hey  sister  what about you 
you re an officer 
how about showing us a little leadership 
forget fucking shirley temple 
you take charge 
right 
  you run things here anyway 
no fuckin  way 
i m not the officer type 
i just take care of my own 
well  what does this fucking beast want 
is this mother gonna try for us all 
yeah 
  well  ain t that sweet 
so how are we gonna stop it 
we have no weapons 
is that correct 
right 
i haven t seen one exactly like this before 
moves differently 
but the others were afraid of fire    
   not much else 
can we seal off this area 
  no chance 
the installation s 1 0 miles square 
there s 600 air ducts
running to the surface 
what about video 
i see these closed circuit
monitors everywhere 
we could try to find it that way 
the video system hasn t worked in years 
nothing much works here 
we got a lot of technology 
no way to fix it 
what 85 is trying to tell you is 
  don t call me that 
we ain t got no entertainment center 
no climate control 
no video system 
no surveillance 
no freezers  no fucking ice cream 
no rubbers  no women  no guns 
all we got here is shit 
oh  what the hell are we
even talking to her for 
she s the one that brought the fucker 
why don t we just get her head
and shove it through the fucking wall 
that sounds good to me 
hey  morse 
why don t you shut the fuck up 
hmm 
right 
right  what are we going to do 
what s this 
um 
that leads from the mess hall
to the infirmary 
it s a ventilation shaft 
then we go in there  flush it out 
hey  hey  look  there s miles and miles
of tunnel through there 
it won t go far 
it ll nest in this area 
right around   
   here 
how do you know that 
it s like a lion 
it sticks close to the zebras 
zebras  oh  right 
but  look  running around down here
in the dark  are you kidding 
once you get out of this main shaft 
there s no overheads 
don t we have flashlights 
we got thousands of  em 
but no batteries 
i told you  nothing works 
torches 
do we have the capacity to make fire 
most humans have enjoyed that privilege
since the stone age 
no need to be sarcastic 
never been used  they were gonna
dump a lot of nuclear crap in there 
never got around to it 
it s clean as a whistle inside 
this the only way in or out 
that s right  walls are
six feet thick  solid steel 
really knew how to build these babies 
you re saying we get something in there 
there s no way it can get out 
that s right  no fucking way 
this is where we keep it 
i forget what the stuff s called 
quinitricetyline 
l knew that 
right  i ve got to get these section
arrangements organized with dillon   
   for the paintbrush  uh 
so  um  david 
yeah  you can get these drums organized 
right  85 
and  uh  don t call me that 
what s this 85 thing 
couple of us sneaked a look at
his personnel file the day he arrived 
lt s his i q 
i saw a drum of this stuff   
   fall into a beachhead bunker once 
the blast put a tug
in dry dock for 1 7 weeks 
great stuff 
all right 
let me get this straight 
you want to burn it down
and out of the pipes 
force it in here 
slam the door   
   and trap its ass 
right 
and you want help
from us y chromo boys  huh 
you got something better to do 
why should we put our ass
on the line for you 
your ass is already on the line 
the only question is   
   what are you gonna do about it 
look at this 
there s only one of these fucking batteries
in 2 000 that works 
hey  it could have been a lot worse 
yeah 
we might have got the paintbrush detail 
man  this stuff stinks 
this shit smells awful 
then don t breathe   
   the fucking fumes 
i m in a fucking pipe with it 
how can i keep from breathing it 
i mean 
don t breathe too hard 
you ll get high 
that s good for me 
so you miss doc  right 
what makes you say that 
i thought you two got real close 
i guess you ve been looking
through some keyholes 
that s what i thought 
oh

we gotta figure out a way to do it
before they come here 
why do we have to kill it 
you just said the company s coming for it 
that s right 
they wanna take it back 
some sort of weapon 
yeah  what s wrong with that 
they can t control it 
they don t understand  it ll kill them all 
like i said 
what s wrong with that 
nothing s wrong with that   
except a lot of innocent people will die 
i thought you were a religious man 
you don t understand  do you 
that world out there
doesn t exist for us anymore 
we ve got our own little world out here 
it ain t much  but it s ours 
so fuck everybody else

haemorrhaging will show as a dark patch 
look for   
   hairline fractures
through the base of the skull 
little white lines 
what is it 
i think you ve got one inside of you 
that s not possible 
what does it look like

  you don t want to look at it 
freeze it 
l m sorry 
all right  the fucking thing is loose 
it s out there 
a rescue team is on its way
with guns and shit 
right now there isn t
any place that s real safe 
but we stay here 
in the assembly hall 
this place never had
any fucking air conditioning 
if it comes in  it s gotta be through
one of these doors 
now we post a guard
to let us know if it s coming 
in the meantime 
you lay low  be ready and stay right   
   in case your time comes 
don t you start bullshitting  dillon 
we re gonna be trapped in here like rats 
you got a weapon  you got a blade 
then you take it out and you fucking use it 
oh  right  so you think we re gonna
stab this mothersucker to death 
no  i don t think shit  maybe 
maybe you ll hurt it
before it takes you out  huh 
isn t that something 
any of you got any better ideas 
and i ll tell you  until the rescue team
gets here  we re fucked 
so you better get prepared 
well  i ain t staying here 
well  then  suit yourself

holy shit 
well  all right

tell them the whole place has gone toxic 
are you kidding 
then they won t come here 
the rescue team will turn back 
yeah  i know 
what are you talking about 
our only hope is that they kill this fucker 
and maybe they can do something for you 
i don t know  freeze you 
they can do an operation 
they ve got the technology 
if this organism gets off the planet 
it ll kill everything 
the company doesn t care about that 
they just want it for
their bioweapons division  okay 
so we can t let them come here 
fuck you 
look  i m sorry you ve got this thing
inside you  but l m getting rescued 
i don t give a shit about these
stupid prisoners  but l ve got a wife  a kid

i think you re okay 
ah 
thanks 
have you got any ideas 
it won t kill me 
i m carrying the new queen 
it won t kill its future 
you really wanna bet
this thing s that smart 
maybe i ll go find it 
see how smart it is 
you re gonna go and look for it 
yeah 
i have a pretty good idea of where it is 
it s just down there    in the basement 
this whole place is a basement 
it s a metaphor  wanna come 
fuck me 
where are you when i need you 
don t be afraid 
l m part of the family 
you ve been in my life so long 
i can t remember anything else 
now do something for me

oh 
it won t kill me 
  what are you doing out here 
you re supposed to be laying low 
i have one inside of me 
big one won t kill its own 
what are you talking about 
i just saw it 
an hour ago 
i stood right next to it 
i could ve been lunch 
but it wouldn t touch me 
it ran away 
it knows i m carrying its future 
aw  bullshit  how do you know
that thing s inside you 
i saw it    on the cat scan 
it s a queen  an egg layer 
it can make thousands more
like the one we ve got here 
still sounds like bullshit to me 
if that thing s inside you 
how d it get there 
i don t know 
when i was in hypersleep  i guess 
l was violated 
now i get to be the mother 
i don t have much time 
and i can t do what i should 
i need you to help me 
i need you to kill me 
what the fuck are you talking about 
  i m dead anyway 
i can t survive it 
but the one inside of me
can generate thousands more 
can wipe out the whole universe 
lt has to die 
so somebody s gotta kill me 
are you up to it 
you don t have to worry about that 
no speeches 
no prayers 
what s going on 
  i don t like losing a fight 
not to nobody  not to nothing 
fuck 
that damn thing out there   
   has already killed half my men 
got the other half scared shitless 
as long as it s alive  sister 
you re not gonna save any universe 
you said you were gonna kill me 
you fucking coward 
  i want that thing 
i want to get this thing 
and i need you to do it 
and if it won t kill you 
then maybe that helps us fight it 
otherwise  fuck you 
go kill yourself 
dillon 
we waste this thing 
then you take care of me 
no problem 
quick  easy and painless 
this is the choice 
you die sitting here on your ass 
or you die out there 
at least we take a shot 
we owe it one 
it s fucked us up 
maybe we can get even for the others 
now how do you want it 
  what the fuck are you talking about 
i m talkin  about killing
that big motherfucker 
hold it  hold it 
the rescue team s on its way 
we could just sit this out 
rescue team for whom 
  for us 
they just want the beast 
you know that 
i don t give a damn what they want 
they re not gonna
pick us off one by one  are they 
i wouldn t be so sure 
come on 
they re gonna take us home 
they re not gonna take us home 
still doesn t mean we should
go out and fight it 
jesus christ  give us a break 
  you guys have got to be fucking nuts 
look  i ve got a wife and a kid 
  nobody gives a shit about you  85 
you re not one of us 
you re not a believer 
you re a fucking company man 
  yeah  okay 
okay  i m a company man
and not a fucking criminal 
you keep telling me how dumb i am 
well  i m smart enough not to have
a life sentence on this rock 
fuck you 
  piss off  85 
yeah  and i m smart enough to wait
for some firepower to show up   
   before we fight this thing 
right  morse 
right  okay  just sit here
on your asses  fine 
how about if i sit here on my ass 
no problem  oh  i forgot 
you re the guy that s
made a deal with god   
   to live forever  huh 
and all the rest of you pussies
can sit it out too 
me and her will do all the fighting 
okay  but i want the same thing as you 
i want to see it dead  i hate the fucker 
it killed my mates too 
why the fuck can t we wait for the company
and have some guns on our side 
why do we have to go
on some fucking suicide run 
right 
because they won t kill it 
they might kill you just for having seen it 
but they re not gonna kill it 
that is crazy  that is horseshit 
they will not kill us 
when they first heard about this thing 
it was crew expendable 
the next time they sent in marines 
they were expendable too 
what makes you think they re
gonna care about a bunch of lifers   
   who found god at the ass end of space 
you really think they re going to let you   
   interfere with their plans for this thing 
they think we re  we re crud 
and they don t give a fuck
about one friend of yours   
   that s  that s died 
not one 
have you got some sort of plan 
this is a lead works  isn t it 
all we got to do is lure
the fucking beast into the mould 
drown it in hot lead 
all right  so how do we do that 
yeah  what are we gonna use for bait 
oh  fuck 
  we re all gonna die 
the only question is when 
this is as good a place as any   
   to take your first steps to heaven 
only question is how you check out 
do you want it on your feet   
   or on your fucking knees  begging 
i ain t much for begging 
nobody ever gave me nothin  
so i say fuck that thing 
let s fight it 
fuck it  let s go for it 
let s kick its fucking ass 
what if it runs at us 
that s a fucking good idea 
channel a  door 1 open 
when was the last time
you used this place 
we fired it up five  six years ago 
you sure the piston s gonna work 
there s nothing for sure in this place 
we trap it here first 
then you pull the lever  start the piston 
then the piston s gonna push
the mothersucker right into the mould 
then one of the guys will pour the lead 
end of his ass  end of story 
what if somebody screws it up 
  we re fucked  you got one chance 
one shot at it  that s all 
we ll never have time to reset it 
now remember  when you pull the lever 
for a few seconds you re gonna be
trapped in here with that fuckin  thing 
if you guys don t drop the ball  i won t 
well  you just better be right about
that thing not wanting you 
because if it wants out 
that s how it s gonna go 
through that alcove  through you
