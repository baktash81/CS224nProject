fire in cryogenic compartment
all personnel report to
emergency escape vehicle
launch of the escape lifeboat
will commence
in tminus 20 seconds
an eevs come down
get down to the beach
there may be others
now
talk to me
come on come on
hey frank come on lets go
lets go
wait

oh jesus christ
hell of a way to make a landing

all right all right
lets get it going
keep it together
come on right
right here we go mr dillon
give us strength
o lord to endure
we recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry god
let the circle be unbroken
until the day
amen
amen
thank you gentlemen
this is rumour control
here are the facts
as some of you know
a 337 model eev
crashlanded here at 0600
on the morning watch
there was one survivor
two dead and a droid that was
hopelessly smashed beyond repair
the survivor is a woman
thats what i saw
i just want to say that ive taken
a vow of celibacy
so have we all
that also includes women
yes
weve all taken the vow
shut your gob morse
id like to say that i for one
do not appreciate company policy
allowing her to freely
intermingle with inmates
and the rest of the staff
what brother means to say is we view
the presence of any outsider
especially a woman
as a violation of the harmony
a potential break in the spiritual unity
we are well aware
of your feelings in this matter
you will be pleased to know
that i have requested a rescue team
hopefully they will be here
inside of a week
oh come on
and evacuate her asap
dont give us that
whats her medical status
she doesnt seem too badly damaged
shes unconscious cant give you
a more specific diagnosis at the moment
will she live
i would think so
look its in everybodys interest
the woman doesnt come
out of the infirmary
until the rescue team arrives
and certainly not without an escort right
sir
gentlemen we should all stick
to our set routine
and not get unduly agitated
right
correct
all right
thank you gentlemen
all right
better get here soon
or there aint gonna be much left
whats that
its just a little cocktail of my own mix
sort of eyeopener
you a doctor
my name is clemens
im the chief medical officer here
here
fury 161
its one of weylandyutanis
backwater work prisons
it grieves me to say
do you mind
this is basically a stabilizer
i really ought to shave your head
we have a big problem with lice here
and when youre feeling better
ill give you some clippers
and you can tend to
your private parts yourself
howd i get here
you crashlanded in an eev
evidently separated from your mother ship
before you hit our atmosphere
you have any idea
how long you were in hypersleep
cause coming out the way you did
can be quite a jolt to the system
yeah ill be sick for a couple of weeks
indeed
where are the others
they didnt make it
what
they didnt survive
i have to get to the ship
have to get to the ship
youre in no condition for that
you want to get me some clothes
or should i just go like this
given the nature of our
indigenous population
i would suggest clothes
none of them have seen a woman in years
neither have i for that matter
this used to be a 5000 convict facility
but its been reduced
to a custodial staff of 25
why
keep the pilot light on
the pilot light for what
blast furnace natural methane
we have a foundry
lieutenant ripley
the inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containers
how do you know my name
its stencilled on the back of your shorts
release the cable
where are the bodies
we have a morgue
we put them there
until the investigative team arrives
in about a week i think
there was a droid
disconnected
there were bits and pieces of him
all over the place
we put what was left on the rubbish tip
the corporal was impaled
by that safety support
he never knew what hit him
and the girl
she drowned in her cryotube
i dont think she was conscious
when it happened
um im sorry
whats the matter
where is she
in the morgue
i have to see her
i have to see whats left of her
is there any particular reason
that youre so insistent
yes i have to be sure how she died
i hate to be repetitious
about such a sensitive subject
but it is perfectly clear that she drowned
was she your daughter
no she wasnt
um
ccould i have a moment alone please
yes of course
forgive me
whats she doing
okay
no
we have to do an autopsy
what
i told you
we have to make sure how she died
and i told you she drowned
im not so sure
ii have to see inside of her
youre disorientated
half your systems still in
i have a very
very good reason
well perhaps youd like to
share that reason
possible contagion
what kind exactly
cholera
cholera
there hasnt been a case of cholera
reported for 200 years
please
everythings in place
theres no sign of infection
no indication of disease
chest
open the chest
careful
lungs
flooded with fluid
ergo she drowned
now since im not a complete idiot
would you like to tell me
what were really looking for
mr clemens
superintendent
i dont believe youve met
lieutenant ripley
whats going on mr clemens
thats right sir
whats going on mr clemens
well first
the lieutenant is feeling much better
im happy to say
second in the interest of public health
i am performing an autopsy
without my authority
well there didnt seem to be time
but its turned out all right
theres no sign of contagion in the body
good
but it might be helpful if lt ripley
didnt parade around in
front of the prisoners
as i am told she did in the last hour
it might also be helpful
if you kept me informed as to
any change in her physical status
or would that be asking too much
we have to cremate the bodies
nonsense well keep the bodies on ice
till the rescue team arrives
on ice
there is the public health issue
the lieutenant feels that there is still
a possibility of a communicable infection
i thought you said
there was no sign of disease
it would appear that the child drowned
but without the benefit
of proper laboratory tests
its impossible to be absolutely certain
i would consider it unwise
to tolerate even the possibility
of an unwelcome virus
an outbreak of cholera
would look extremely bad on a report
would it not sir
weve 25 prisoners in this facility
all doubleychromos
all thieves rapists
murderers child molesters all scum
just because theyve taken on religion
doesnt make them any less dangerous
i try not to offend their convictions
i dont want to upset the order
i dont want ripples in the water
and i dont want a woman walking around
giving them ideas
i see for my own personal safety
exactly
i will leave the details of the cremation
to you mr clemens
they may use the furnace but i want
everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours
you called it sir
ah christmas has come early murph
what do you mean
any dead ox is a good ox
youre bloody right
smelly bastards all covered in lice
theres only seven of the friggin things left
and then were done with them
god i hates hosin these bastards down
i always get shite all over me boots
talkin of hosing things down frank
yeah
you had the chance
what would you say to her
what do you mean
if i got the chance
you know
if you got the chance
you mean casual like
yeah i mean how would you
put it to her if you bumped into her
in the mess hall or somewhere
no problem
ive never had any problem with the ladies
id say to her good day my dear
hows it goin
anything i can do to be of service
then id give her the look
you know up and down
and id give her the wink
the dirty smile
shed soon get the picture
yeah right
and then shed say
kiss my ass you horny old fucker
id be happy to kiss her ass
id be happy to kiss her
anywhere she wants
yeah but treat em mean
keep em keen right frank
told you before murph
treat a queen like a whore
and a whore like a queen
cant go wrong
what do you think killed babe
beats me she just keeled over
how old was she
the charts say 1 1
in her prime never mind
well chop her up later
and throw her in the stew
right
hey frank
whats this
we commit this child
and this man to your keeping o lord
their bodies
have been taken
from the shadow of our nights
they have been released
from all darkness and pain
the child and the man
have gone beyond our world
they are forever eternal
and everlasting
ashes to ashes dust to dust
why
why are the innocent punished
why the sacrifice
why the pain
there arent any promises
nothings certain
only that some get called
some get saved
she wont ever know
the hardship and grief
for those of us left behind
we commit these bodies to the void
with a glad heart
for within each seed
there is a promise of a flower
and within each death
no matter how small
theres always a new life
a new beginning
amen
amen
ill tell you its fucking weird
the only one to survive
that crash is a woman
what trouble can she cause
shes already changed everything
what the fuck are we supposed to do
i for one
i mean it
okay
theres a lot of talk going around
that weve got some disharmony here
any you guys want to tell me
what the problem is
come on
speak to me brothers
all right ill tell ya
i dont mind the dark
i dont mind the bugs
i dont mind wanderin around in some
cold wet damp tunnel for a week at a time
i dont mind anything
but i mind golic
that the way you feel about it
yeah the guys crazy and he smells bad
i aint going out with him anymore
you got anything to say for yourself
well hes going with you
golic is just another poor miserable
suffering son of a bitch
just like you and me
cept he smells worse
and hes crazy
knock off the shit
you got a job to do
i dont want to hear
another word about golic
okay
well hello
as i thought mr aaron
as i thought
you called it sir
i just wanted to uh say thanks
for what you said at the funeral
it was uh
my friends would have appreciated it
yeah well you dont wanna know me lady
im a murderer and rapist of women
really
well i guess i must make you nervous
do you have any faith sister
not much
well weve got a lot of faith here
enough even for you
i thought women werent allowed
well weve never had any before
but we tolerate anybody
even the intolerable
thank you
thats just a statement of principle
nothing personal
you see weve got
a good place to wait here
and until now no temptation
what are you waiting for
huh
were waiting for god to return
and raise his servants to redemption
dillon and the rest
of the alternative people
embraced religion as it were
about five years ago
tincture
im on medication
hardly
what kind of religion
some sort of apocalyptic millenarian
christian fundamentalist uh
right
exactly
point is when the company
wanted to close the facility down
dillon and the rest of the converts
wanted to stay
and they were allowed
to remain as custodians
with two minders
and a medical officer
and here we are
how did you get
this wonderful assignment
how do you like your new haircut
its okay
now that ive gone out on a limb
for you with andrews
damaged my already lessthanperfect
relationship with that good man
and briefed you
on the humdrum history of fury 1 61
can you not tell me
what you were looking for in the girl
you attracted to me
ln what way
ln that way
very direct
ive been out here a long time
so have i
in the year 7510
if gods acomin
he oughta make it by then
maybe hell look around and say
guess its time for the judgment
yech
in the year
hey spike
spike spikey
are you down there
what are you doing
i really appreciate your affections
but i am aware that they
deflected my question
in the nicest possible way of course
youre spoiling the mood
i have a job to do
i just want to know why
we had to cremate the bodies
and now that im in your cot
you think i owe you an answer
i think you owe me an answer
being in my beds got nothing to do with it
i had a terrible dream in hypersleep
and i had to be sure what killed her
anyway i made a mistake
possibly
and now ive made another mistake
really whats that
fraternizing with a prisoner
physical contact
its against the rules isnt it
definitely when was this
l think you know
im not a prisoner
you have a bar code
on the back of your head
that does deserve an explanation
but i dont think now is the moment
sorry we are rather
spoiling things arent we
mr clemens
mr aaron
superintendent andrews
would like you to report
to vent shaft 22
on the second quadrant now
weve had an accident
something serious
you could call it that
one of our prisoners has been diced
sorry i have to go
official duties
who was it
murphy
how do you know
thats his boot
i gave him the assignment sir
he was a wanker
no apologies mr aaron
it wasnt your fault
well not much to say is there
death was instantaneous
no shit
i take it he was pulled into the fan
sudden rush of air
id imagine except
right
almost happened to me once
ive told him so many times
stay away from the fans
nobody bloody listens
except the fan was blowing
whats that
i dont know
i want to see you in my quarters
in 30 minutes if youll please mr clemens
have you got any ideas
here you are you know
wandering around without an escort
is really gonna piss
superintendent andrews off
will you tell me about your accident
one of the prisoners has been killed
really how
hmm
in the air shaft
poor soul backed into a ninefoot fan
i found something at the accident site
just a bit away from where it happened
a mark a burn
rather like the one you found
on the girls cryotube
look im on your side
i want to help but i need to know
whats going on
or what you think is going on
lf you really wanna help
find me a computer
with audio capabilities
so i can access this flight recorder
we dont have anything like that here
well what about bishop
bishop
the droid that crashed with me
i can point you in the right direction
i cant join you
i have a previous engagement
thisll top you up
golic dont fidget
whats all this shit
its not properly wrapped
what the hell does he ever do right
eat
hes got that down pretty good
golic
you light a candle for murphy
ill light a thousand
he was special
never complained about me once
i loved him
is it true what they say
his head split into a million pieces
okay whos got the matches
sit down mr clemens
thank you
sugar
uh no thanks
milk
just a little please
thank you mr aaron
listen to me you piece of shit
you screw with me
one more time ill cut you in half
im sorry
i dont think i understand
at 0700 hours i received word
from the network
i may point out this is the first
highlevel communication
this installation has ever received
to my knowledge
they want this woman looked after
they consider her to be very high priority
why
l have no idea
but why did you let her
out of the infirmary
this accident with murphy
is what happens
when one of these dumb
sons of a bitches
walks around with a hardon
im a doctor youre the jailer
we both know exactly what you are
sit down
i think it might be better if i left
i find you
unpleasant to be around
you do isnt that lovely
consider this mr clemens
how would you like me to explain
your sordid history
to your newfound friend
for her personal edification of course
now sit the hell down
i dont like you
youre unpredictable
insolent possibly dangerous
you question everything
if i didnt need a medical officer
i wouldnt let you within
light years of this operation
im eternally grateful
keep your sarcasms to yourself
now is there anything i should know
about what
about the woman
dont play with me mr clemens
you spend every second you can with her
and i have my suspicions not all of
your concerns with her are medical
has she said anything to you anything
about where shes
from what her mission is
what the hell she was doing in an eev
she told me she was part of a combat unit
that came to grief
beyond that i assume its all classified
i havent pressed her for more
thats all
thats all
youre sure
yes
nothing more
no
get out of here
shut up you fuckin bitch
get in there
shut up you bitch
nobodys gonna hear you
goddamn it let go of me
fuck you no
hold still shh shh
no goddamn it
you okay
no son of a bitch
take off i gotta reeducate
some of the brothers
weve gotta discuss
some matters of the spirit
cigarettes
so lets do it
this is like 1 0 city blocks
how many
this makes 1 76
cant you chew a little quieter
im trying to figure out
how big this compartment is
i cant think with all this
goddamn noise youre making
youre not supposed to swear
im sorry
now weve encircled
this entire compartment once
hey
what
what the shit is doing that
swearing
shut up
its all right to say shit
it aint against god
what the hell is going on with the candles
must be the wind
from one of the vent shafts
backwash from the closest circulating unit
but if all the candles go out
how the hell we gonna know
where we are
somebody will just have to
go back and relight them
i guess im nominated
watch your step brother
okay who are the comedians
wait wait wait
quick grab it here
help me help me
go fuckin go
go go go quick run
gimme that
get this fucking thing off me
oh fuck
let me go
hey
ah ripley
hi bishop
how you feeling
my legs hurt
uh listen im sorry
its okay
im just a glorified toaster
how are you
i like your new haircut
bishop can you access data
on the flight recorder
no problem
golic
im home
what happened on the sulaco
why were our cryotubes ejected
stasis interrupted
fire in cryogenic compartment
repeat fire in cryogenic what happened
what started the fire bishop
can you hear me
the fire was electrical
lt was in the subflooring
did the sensors pick up anything
moving around on the
ship prior to separation
its very dark here ripley
im not what i used to be
just tell me does the recorder
indicate anything
was there an alien on board
yes
is it on the sulaco or did it
come with us on the eev
it was with us all the way
does the company know
the company knows everything
that happened on the ship
it all goes into the computer
and gets sent back to network
and they want it
i hurt do me a favour
disconnect me
i could be reworked
but ill never be top of the line again
id rather be nothing
youre sure
do it for me ripley
it wasnt me i didnt do it
it was it was the dragon
feeds on minds it was
nobody can stop it
what about boggs and rains
they got sslaughtered like pigs
it wasnt me
it wasnt me
stark raving mad
im not saying it was anyones fault
but he should have been chained up
you called it sir
mad as a fucking hatter
keep him separated from the rest
i dont want him causing a panic
clemens
sedate this poor idiot
yeah
not until we know about the brothers
now now pull yourself together
talk to me now
now where are boggs and rains
it wasnt me
hopeless youre not gonna
get anything out of him
it wasnt me
well have to send out
a search team
im afraid well have to assume
theres a very good chance
this simple bastard has murdered them
now you dont know that
hes never lied to me
hes crazy hes a fool
but hes not a liar
hes telling the truth
id like to talk to him about this this dragon
it was a dragon
youre not talking
to anyone lieutenant
im not interested in your opinion
because you are not
in full possession of the facts
this man is a convicted multiple murderer
known for particularly brutal crimes
isnt that right mr dillon
yeah that parts right
then ill talk to you lts important
when i have finished
with my official duties
i will be quite pleased
to have a little chat yes
let me see if i have this correct lieutenant
its an eightfoot creature of some kind
with acid for blood
and it arrived on your spaceship
it kills on sight and is generally unpleasant
and of course you expect me to accept
all this on your word
no i dont expect anything
quite a story mr aaron
right sir its a beauty
never heard anything quite like it sir
expect not
tell me lieutenant
what would you suggest we do
well what kind of weapons have you got
this is a prison
its not a good idea to allow prisoners
access to firearms
what keeps them from killing you
fear theres no way to escape
with the arrival of the next supply ship
the company would eliminate them
this is a maximum security prison
and you have no weapons of any kind
we have some carving
knives in the abattoir
a few more in the mess hall
some fire axes scattered about the place
nothing terribly formidable
thats all
were on the honor system
then were fucked
no youre fucked
confined to the infirmary
quarantined
mr aaron will escort you
i think youll be safe from any large
nasty beast while youre there right
yes thats a good girl
lets all report to the mess hall
superintendent andrews wants a meeting
mess hall right away people
isnt there any way off of this place
some way to escape
no supply ship comes every six months
and thats it
mmhmm
fuck
they are sending somebody
to pick you up quite soon i gather
really
whats soon
i dont know nobodys ever been
in a hurry to get here before
do you want to tell me
what you and andrews talked about
no
youll just say im crazy
thats a bit uncharitable
how are you feeling
not so hot
sore throat
sick to my stomach
pissed off
well thats understandable
given the circumstances
perhaps i should give you
one of my special cocktails
i dont know why everybody
blames everybody for everything
nobodys perfect only human
theres no such thing as a perfect human
in an insane world
a sane man
must appear insane
thats very profound golic
thank you
you married
me
you should get married
have kids
pretty girl i used to know
lots of em back home
they used to like me
for a while
youre gonna die too
are you
what
married
why
just curious
no
how about levelling with me
could you be more specific
when i asked how you got assigned here
you avoided the question
and then when i asked about the prison id
tattooed on the back of your head
you ducked me again
lts a long sad story
and more than a little melodramatic
try me
if you insist
after my student years
despite the fact that i had become
secretly addicted to morphine
i was considered to be most promising
a man with a future
and during my first residency
i did a 36hour stretch on an er
so i went out and i got
more than a little drunk
then i got called back
boiler had blown on a fuel plant
and there were 30 casualties
and 1 1 of them died
not as a result of the accident
but because i prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller
i got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3c
at least i got off the morphine
lm sorry
l think i was let off lightly
did you serve your time here
i got to know this motley crew quite well
so when they stayed i stayed
nobody else would employ me
so do you still trust me with a needle
magnificent
give us strength o lord to endure
we recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry god
let the circle be unbroken
until the day amen
amen
what the fuck is happening here
what the fuck is this
bullshit thats comin down
we got murder we got rape
we got brothers in trouble
i dont want no more bullshit around here
now we got problems
we stand together
yes thank you mr dillon all right
once again this is rumour control
here are the facts
at 0800 hours
prisoner murphy
through carelessness on his part
was found dead in vent shaft 1 7
he seems to have been
sucked into a ventilator fan
at about 2100 hours
prisoner golic reappeared
in a deranged state
prisoners boggs and rains are missing
there seems to be a good chance
that they have met with foul play
at the hands of prisoner golic
we need to organize
and send out a search party
volunteers will be appreciated
i think its fair to say
that our smoothly running facility
has suddenly developed a few problems
i can only hope we are able to all
pull together over the next few days
until the rescue team arrives
for lieutenant ripley
lts here it got clemens
stop this raving at once stop it
im telling you its here
aaron get that foolish woman
back to the infirmary
move it
out of my way
fuck
we give you thanks o lord
your wrath has come
and the time is near for us to be judged
the apocalypse is upon us
let us be ready
let your mercy be just
it was massive
amen
and fast
l was there i saw it
what the fuck do we do now
whos in fucking charge
organize we gotta organize right
right well i guess im next in line
85s gonna be in charge
jesus give us a break
dont call me that
okay look theres no way
i can replace andrews
he was a good man
i know you guys didnt appreciate him
aaron we dont want to hear that shit now
hey sister what about you
youre an officer
how about showing us a little leadership
forget fucking shirley temple
you take charge
right
you run things here anyway
no fuckin way
im not the officer type
i just take care of my own
well what does this fucking beast want
is this mother gonna try for us all
yeah
well aint that sweet
so how are we gonna stop it
we have no weapons
is that correct
right
i havent seen one exactly like this before
moves differently
but the others were afraid of fire
not much else
can we seal off this area
no chance
the installations 1 0 miles square
theres 600 air ducts
running to the surface
what about video
i see these closedcircuit
monitors everywhere
we could try to find it that way
the video system hasnt worked in years
nothing much works here
we got a lot of technology
no way to fix it
what 85 is trying to tell you is
dont call me that
we aint got no entertainment center
no climate control
no video system
no surveillance
no freezers no fucking ice cream
no rubbers no women no guns
all we got here is shit
oh what the hell are we
even talking to her for
shes the one that brought the fucker
why dont we just get her head
and shove it through the fucking wall
that sounds good to me
hey morse
why dont you shut the fuck up
hmm
right
right what are we going to do
whats this
um
that leads from the mess hall
to the infirmary
its a ventilation shaft
then we go in there flush it out
hey hey look theres miles and miles
of tunnel through there
it wont go far
itll nest in this area
right around
here
how do you know that
its like a lion
it sticks close to the zebras
zebras oh right
but look running around down here
in the dark are you kidding
once you get out of this main shaft
theres no overheads
dont we have flashlights
we got thousands of em
but no batteries
i told you nothing works
torches
do we have the capacity to make fire
most humans have enjoyed that privilege
since the stone age
no need to be sarcastic
never been used they were gonna
dump a lot of nuclear crap in there
never got around to it
its clean as a whistle inside
this the only way in or out
thats right walls are
six feet thick solid steel
really knew how to build these babies
youre saying we get something in there
theres no way it can get out
thats right no fucking way
this is where we keep it
i forget what the stuffs called
quinitricetyline
l knew that
right ive got to get these section
arrangements organized with dillon
for the paintbrush uh
so um david
yeah you can get these drums organized
right 85
and uh dont call me that
whats this 85 thing
couple of us sneaked a look at
his personnel file the day he arrived
lts his iq
i saw a drum of this stuff
fall into a beachhead bunker once
the blast put a tug
in dry dock for 1 7 weeks
great stuff
all right
let me get this straight
you want to burn it down
and out of the pipes
force it in here
slam the door
and trap its ass
right
and you want help
from us ychromo boys huh
you got something better to do
why should we put our ass
on the line for you
your ass is already on the line
the only question is
what are you gonna do about it
look at this
theres only one of these fucking batteries
in 2000 that works
hey it could have been a lot worse
yeah
we might have got the paintbrush detail
man this stuff stinks
this shit smells awful
then dont breathe
the fucking fumes
im in a fucking pipe with it
how can i keep from breathing it
i mean
dont breathe too hard
youll get high
thats good for me
so you miss doc right
what makes you say that
i thought you two got real close
i guess youve been looking
through some keyholes
thats what i thought
oh
oh
you okay
yeah lm fine

i dont have much time
and i cant do what i should
i need you to help me
i need you to kill me
what the fuck are you talking about
im dead anyway
i cant survive it
but the one inside of me
can generate thousands more

lt has to die
so somebodys gotta kill me

you dont have to worry about that
no speeches
no prayers
whats going on
i dont like losing a fight
not to nobody not to nothing

as long as its alive sister
youre not gonna save any universe
you said you were gonna kill me
you fucking coward
i want that thing
i want to get this thing
and i need you to do it
and if it wont kill you
then maybe that helps us fight it
otherwise fuck you
go kill yourself
dillon
we waste this thing
then you take care of me
no problem
quick easy and painless
this is the choice
you die sitting here on your ass
or you die out there
at least we take a shot
we owe it one
its fucked us up
maybe we can get even for the others
now how do you want it
what the fuck are you talking about
im talkin about killing
that big motherfucker
hold it hold it
the rescue teams on its way
we could just sit this out
rescue team for whom
for us
they just want the beast
you know that
i dont give a damn what they want
theyre not gonna
pick us off one by one are they
i wouldnt be so sure
come on
theyre gonna take us home
theyre not gonna take us home
still doesnt mean we should
go out and fight it
jesus christ give us a break
you guys have got to be fucking nuts
look ive got a wife and a kid
nobody gives a shit about you 85
youre not one of us
youre not a believer
youre a fucking company man
yeah okay
okay im a company man
and not a fucking criminal
you keep telling me how dumb i am
well im smart enough not to have
a life sentence on this rock
fuck you
piss off 85
yeah and im smart enough to wait
for some firepower to show up
before we fight this thing
right morse
right okay just sit here
on your asses fine
how about if i sit here on my ass
no problem oh i forgot
youre the guy thats
made a deal with god
to live forever huh
and all the rest of you pussies
can sit it out too
me and her will do all the fighting
okay but i want the same thing as you
i want to see it dead i hate the fucker
it killed my mates too
why the fuck cant we wait for the company
and have some guns on our side
why do we have to go
on some fucking suicide run
right
because they wont kill it
they might kill you just for having seen it
but theyre not gonna kill it
that is crazy that is horseshit
they will not kill us
when they first heard about this thing
it was crew expendable
the next time they sent in marines
they were expendable too
what makes you think theyre
gonna care about a bunch of lifers
who found god at the ass end of space
you really think theyre going to let you
interfere with their plans for this thing
they think were were crud
and they dont give a fuck
about one friend of yours
thats thats died
not one
have you got some sort of plan
this is a lead works isnt it
all we got to do is lure
the fucking beast into the mould
drown it in hot lead
all right so how do we do that
yeah what are we gonna use for bait
oh fuck
were all gonna die
the only question is when
this is as good a place as any
to take your first steps to heaven
only question is how you check out
do you want it on your feet
or on your fucking knees begging
i aint much for begging
nobody ever gave me nothin
so i say fuck that thing
lets fight it
fuck it lets go for it
lets kick its fucking ass
what if it runs at us
thats a fucking good idea
channel a door 1 open

you sure the pistons gonna work
theres nothing for sure in this place
we trap it here first
then you pull the lever start the piston
then the pistons gonna push
the mothersucker right into the mould
then one of the guys will pour the lead
end of his ass end of story
what if somebody screws it up
were fucked you got one chance
one shot at it thats all
well never have time to reset it
now remember when you pull the lever
for a few seconds youre gonna be
trapped in here with that fuckin thing
