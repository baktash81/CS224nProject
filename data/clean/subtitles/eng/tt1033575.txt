matt my friends on the mainland think just
because i live in hawaii i live in paradise
like a permanent vacation
were all just out here sipping mai tais
shaking our hips and catching waves
are they insane
do they think were immune to life
how can they possibly think
our families are less screwed up
our cancers less fatal
our heartaches less painful
hell i havent been on a surfboard
in 15 years
for the last 23 days
ive been living in a paradise of
ivs and urine bags and tracheal tubes
paradise
paradise can go fuck itself
ekg beeping
this is elizabeth
thorson king my wife

we dont think these photographs
are appropriate for scottie to
be sharing with her classmates
some of them went home quite disturbed
and we got some angry calls from parents
yeah shes kind of been going to town
on this whole picturetaking thing
i had no idea
mr king we see this every day
children acting out in school
when something is wrong at home
and your family
is facing a devastating crisis
have you been engaging scottie in talking
about everything thats going on
yes yes absolutely
counselor
encouraging her to express her feelings
thats crucial
mmhm i understand
matt whats the matter with you showing
those pictures of mom for your art project
scottie im a photographer dad
a real photographer
matt no youre overdoing it
is what youre doing
scottie
i saw it in a book
some famous photographer lady
took pictures of her mom in the hospital
while she was dying
and theyre considered art
thats what im doing
first of all your mother is very sick
but she isnt dying
and second of all we dont share
personal stuff with strangers
whats going on with your mom
is private
im hungry can we get burgers
no
matt the last time i took care of scottie
by myself was when she was 3
now shes 10 and i have
no idea what to do with her
scottie
but i wanna eat now not in an hour
matt and with elizabeth in the
hospital shes testing me
im the backup parent
the understudy
this is matt king im returning your call
how can i help you
barb over phone
its your daughter scottie
shes been texting some awful things to my
daughter lani and id like her to stop
huh
barb heres the latest one
we all know you grew pubes
over the summer
i mean my daughter cant help it if
shes developing a little early for her age
you think thats nice
well thats not like her at all
shes usually very sweet
as you may know her mother isnt well
maybe this is how shes dealing with it
barb im very sorry about
your family situation mr king
but my daughter comes home
from school in tears
yeah no i get it im sorry
barb scotties the one
who should be sorry
i want her to come
over and apologize
and i dont ever want her
to text my daughter again
if she doesnt apologize
ill take it up with the dean
you cant buy your way out of this
can you give me an address
thank you for coming by
hi
i forgot to mention scottie said she didnt
wanna be lanis partner at the rock wall
because she didnt wanna fall
into my daughters butt crack
that doesnt even make sense
matt ah
man on tv
shirts off shirts off
good good good good job
i dont think she has any idea
that was very good bobby brown
yeah here
because she goes im living at this
ill meet you out in front so
scottie you have something
you wanna say to lani
sorry
its okay man he knows
hes going away for a while
if hes got a chance hes bolting
great well it was nice meeting you both
you should come over for a swim
or a hike or something okay
barb
i dont think shes sorry at all
shes gonna keep on doing it i can tell
matt no she wont
look scottie youre gonna stop right
and youre really really sorry right
man seems like every time i forget to pray
we dont catch a guy for three days
i know im telling you man
barb oh and mr king
yeah
good luck with the sale
they say your decision will have a major
impact on hawaiis realestate world
not to mention the whole landscape
of kauai
hundreds of millions of dollars yeah
yeah its a big decision
barb my husbands familys from kauai
hanapepe born and bred
they hope you dont sell
you dont say
all that traffic its gonna make
matt as if lizs coma
werent enough already
the whole goddamn state
is following my decision
on whos gonna buy 25000
pristine acres on kauai
that my family has owned
since the 1860s
a lot of my cousins are broke and
the sale will make us all very very rich
my family meets in six days
to approve a buyer
but ever since my father died
im the sole trustee
which means i alone
hold all the cards
my greatgreatgrandmother was
princess margaret kealohilani
one of the last direct
descendants of king kamehameha
she was originally supposed
to marry her cousin
but she fell in love with edward
king her haole banker
whose parents had
been missionaries
between his land deals
and her huge inheritance
generations of their
descendants all of us
have watched the past unfurl millions
into our laps through leases and sales
now something called
the rule against perpetuities
is forcing us to
dissolve the trust
and were selling our last huge
parcel of virgin hawaiian land
unlike a lot of my cousins i havent
blown my share of the trust money
just like my father before me
i live only on the income
from my law practice
i dont want my daughters growing up
spoiled and entitled
liz always accuses me of stinginess
but i agree with my father
you give your children enough money to do
something but not enough to do nothing
noe
matt
your cousins are here
matt not only am i the sole trustee but i
specialize in realestate transaction law
so a few of the more involved cousins
have been meeting with me to analyze bids
all hey
hal hows it matt
matt cousin hal cousin
milo cousin stan
cousin six cousin wink
cousin connie
how you doing okay
matt  and cousin dave both
of whom oppose the sale entirely
good to see you
matt dont be fooled by appearances
in hawaii some of the most powerful
people look like bums and stuntmen
all right so where are we
matt
proposals are virtually the same
hotels shopping centers condos
and golf courses
i have some major concerns
matt a chicago group
is offering half a billion dollars
but were leaning towards a lower bid
from a guy named don holitzer
hes actually from kauai
made a fortune in silicon valley
old cousin hugh is pushing us in
that direction and i say why not
the money would come from hawaii
and stay in hawaii
stan theres nothing about saving
the heiau you know its ridiculous
and theres no beach access like they say
and thats really really
matt elizabeths gonna make it
out okay i know it
its not her time yet
shell wake up
scottie and alexandra
will have their mother back
and well talk about our marriage
i know i can make things right
ill sell the land quit my practice
and buy her whatever she wants
a big boat a house in france
well take a trip around the world
just the two of us
well get close again
like the early days
johnston
i wish i had better news matthew
but dr chun and dr mueller and i
agree that her condition
its deteriorating
she has no eye movement
she has no pupillary responses
she has no brainstem reflexes
whatsoever
i mean the machines can keep her alive but
the quality of her life would be so poor
basically the way it is now
shell never be the way she was matt
never
we know that now
look uh
i cant tell you how sorry i am
to tell you this
and you do have your daughters
theres just nothing more
that we can do
so if we do go ahead
and take her off the machines
theres no if
its when i have a legal obligation
you know that
how long will she last
well its hard to say
it could be a few days
it could be a couple of weeks
for planning purposes i think you should
work off the shortest possible scenario
i know ive gotta get the ball rolling
on the organ donations right away
matt
elizabeth has many friends
she has a big life
if youre gonna let everybody know
to say goodbye
which is the typical protocol
for these situations you start now
then when the last day comes
theyll feel more ready
or as ready as they can feel
for something like this
im so sorry matt
ekg beeping
kai hey
mark hey there he is
kai hows it going
whats going on
she was looking a little pale lately
all cooped up here
i know shed be mortified if nobody helped
her out with some lipstick and blush
i know shell grill me

on the latest gossip
kai well i dont wanna start
from scratch later
oh and matt uh on the way here
we stopped by and put some meals

what the latest is
you know ive been praying for her every
day you guys really hard seriously
and well what i meant to say was
when i was there i talked to her
and she moved her hand
and then i was like i was encouraged
i thought that
that was an encouraging sign
thats enough
i really think she heard me
look troy go to your friends
theres no hard feelings
lets just leave it alone
i told you matt
the water that day was so choppy
ive told you a hundred times
what happened to her
couldve happened to me
the ocean was brutal that day

she was supposed to be driving
she wanted me to drive
shes the one that told me
to pass the other boat before the turn

plus i almost drowned myself
when the boat caps

and i have to go around
and tell people whats happening
family and a few close friends
sometimes im gonna need you
to come with me
sometimes i need you to watch scottie
you want me to go around with you
and tell people that moms gonna die
whats the point of that
breaking the news watching them cry
dealing with their emotions
how depressing is that gonna be
just call them
alex nobody wants to do any of this
but we have to tell your grandpa and tutu
and a few friends
they have the right to know
and they have the right to say goodbye
i dont wanna talk about mom
with anyone
look whatever you two fought about
over christmas you have to drop it
grow up
you love your mother
your mother loves you
i cant drop it
you have to
you really dont have a clue do you
dad
dad mom was cheating on you
that is what we fought about
when i was home at christmas
i caught her with a guy
it made me sick to see her near you
i went back to school thinking that
that was it that i was just done with her
i was gonna call
and tell you everything and
and then the accident happened and
i was waiting until she woke up i guess
sobbing
you didnt even suspect right
right
it disgusted me too
youre always so busy
caught her with a guy
what does that mean
i was on my way to swim
in the black point pool with brandy
and suddenly i see mom and
some douche bag walking into a house
his house i guess
just some guy it could be anybody
no he had his hand on her ass
it was gross
then what
then nothing
then they went into the house
a few days later
i told her i knew what she was doing
and
and first she acted like she had no idea
what i was talking about
like im fucking blind
and then she got like super mad
and yelled and denied it
that was when i decided that
i didnt want anything more to do with her
who is he
i dont know some guy
whats he look like
dark hair
matt
oh
watch your sister
hello
kai
mark
its me matt
hey
kai no its not
im just saying you always wanna have
mark im not a mind reader
hello
kai wait hello
its me its matt
oh hey matt
matt is this a bad time
uh no no were just fighting
uh come on in you want coffee
you want something to drink
matt
no thanks
mark fighting about something stupid
kai its not stupid
mark
it is stupid
kai
he wants us to throw parties
and have people over which we do
but who winds up doing the work
me i do
mark you dont have to do anything
thats the whole point
kai i do
it doesnt have to be work
you dont have to clean and buy an outfit
im supposed to be disgusting ugh
and think up a goddamn theme cocktail
we could just invite people over
to hang out and drink whatever we have
lets talk about it later
oh shit matt is everything okay
is there any news
in fact there is ill tell you
about it in a minute who is he
does she love him
who is he
matt
im sorry to put you in that position but im
not really the one who put you there am i
id like to know who the guy is
that my wife was seeing
youre angry
you have very keen powers of observation
you know what
i think we should talk about this later
you need to cool it
is it troy that fucking neanderthal
you dont know him
kai mark dont you even shame on you
youre supposed to be her friend
mark well guess what
im matts friend too okay
and this is a unique and dramatic
situation and i would wanna know
yeah well dont betray her
when shes not even here to defend herself
matt look you might not be able
to hear this right now
but its not her fault
your marriage was not
just she was lonely
so youre gonna talk to me
in clichés about women
nothing is ever a womans fault
was it still going on
when she had the accident
but i stayed out of it
any time kai would bring it up
i would walk away
you what
probably egged her on
add a little drama in your life
without any actual risk
who do you think youre protecting kai
she doesnt need your protection
its over shes gonna die
dont say that
matt
its true i was gonna tell you yesterday
shes never gonna wake up
you hear me
do you understand what im saying
shes gone
were pulling the plug
you were putting lipstick on a corpse
crying
mark
come on matt
thats a little intense
sighs

how can you ask about him
when shes gonna die
who cares
yes she loves him loved him whatever
she was crazy about him
she was gonna
she was gonna ask you for a divorce
you still havent told me who he is
i guess it doesnt matter

jibberjabber

its basically her instructions
on what procedures she wants
in this case
i know goddamn well what it says
says she doesnt want us sitting around
watching her spoil like milk
says if theres nothing the doctors can do
shed rather just get on with it
elizabeth had the good sense
to write this thing here
she was always a thoughtful girl
a strong girl
hell of a lot stronger than her brother
barry whines his way through life
might even be a homosexual
for all i know
matt yeah scott i dont think so
and shes stronger than you matt
she lived more in a year
than you lived in a decade
sitting in that office
hoarding all your cash
all that money you refuse to use
what the hell good is it
now you and your family are getting ready
to cash in your chips what the hell for
maybe if you let my baby
have her own boat
bought her safe equipment
maybe let her go
on those shopping sprees women like
maybe she wouldnt have gone in
for those thrill sports
maybe if youd provided more thrills
at home
and you alexandra
putting your mother through hell
when all she was trying to do
was instill sense and drive in you
shame on you shame on you
you should try to be more like her
she was a good girl

to protect is gone forever
now were haole as shit
and we go to private schools and clubs
and we can barely speak pidgin
let alone hawaiian

and were tied to this land

now its a miracle that
for some bullshit reason 150 years ago
we own this much of paradise
but we do

freeman on tv there are few places
harder to get to in this world
but there arent any
where its harder to live
the average temperature here
at the bottom of the earth
is a balmy 58 degrees below
one strawberry
freeman  when the sun is out
one mocha chip
freeman it wasnt always like this
great
freeman antarctica used
to be a tropical place
densely forested and
teeming with life
but then the continent
started to drift south
and by the time it
was done drifting
the dense forests had all been
replaced with a new ground cover ice
as for the former inhabitants
theyd all died or moved on long ago
well almost all of them
the emperor penguin
is technically a bird
although one that makes his home
in the sea
so if youre wondering what hes
doing up here on the ice
well thats part of our story
each year at around the same time
he will leave the comfort
of his ocean home
and embark on a
remarkable journey
he will travel a great distance
and though he is a
bird he wont fly
though he lives in the sea
he wont swim
