matt  my friends on the mainland think just
because i live in hawaii  i live in paradise 
like a permanent vacation 
we re all just out here sipping mai tais 
shaking our hips  and catching waves 
are they insane 
do they think we re immune to life 
how can they possibly think
our families are less screwed up   
    our cancers less fatal   
    our heartaches less painful 
hell  i haven t been on a surfboard
in 15 years 
for the last 23 days   
    i ve been living in a paradise of
ivs and urine bags and tracheal tubes 
paradise 
paradise can go fuck itself 
 ekg beeping 
this is elizabeth
thorson king  my wife 
twenty three days ago   
    she was launched from a powerboat
during a race and hit her head 
almost drowned 
when i heard about the accident and
about the coma  i wasn t even in town 
i was on maui  on business 
and we hadn t spoken in three days 
in a way 
we hadn t really spoken in months 
if you re doing this to get my
attention  liz  it s working 
i m ready now 
i m ready to talk 
i m ready to change 
i m ready to be a real husband
and a real father 
just wake up 
please  liz  just wake up 
 phone buzzing 
hey  noe  what s up 
noe  over phone   matt  scottie s
teacher s on the phone 
she says it s urgent 
okay  put her on 
counselor 
we don t think these photographs   
   are appropriate for scottie to
be sharing with her classmates 
some of them went home quite disturbed 
and we got some angry calls from parents 
yeah  she s kind of been going to town
on this whole picture taking thing 
  i had no idea 
  mr  king  we see this every day 
children acting out in school
when something is wrong at home 
and your family
is facing a devastating crisis 
have you been engaging scottie in talking
about everything that s going on 
yes  yes  absolutely 
counselor 
encouraging her to express her feelings 
  that s crucial 
  mm hm  i understand 
matt  what s the matter with you  showing
those pictures of mom for your art project 
scottie  i m a photographer  dad 
a real photographer 
matt  no  you re overdoing it 
is what you re doing 
scottie 
i saw it in a book 
some famous photographer lady
took pictures of her mom in the hospital   
   while she was dying 
and they re considered art 
that s what i m doing 
first of all  your mother is very sick 
but she isn t dying 
and second of all  we don t share
personal stuff with strangers 
what s going on with your mom
is private 
  i m hungry  can we get burgers 
  no 
matt  the last time i took care of scottie
by myself was when she was 3 
now she s 10  and i have
no idea what to do with her 
scottie 
but i wanna eat now  not in an hour 
matt  and with elizabeth in the
hospital  she s testing me 
i m the backup parent 
the understudy 
this is matt king  i m returning your call 
how can i help you 
barb  over phone  
it s your daughter scottie 
she s been texting some awful things to my
daughter  lani  and i d like her to stop 
  huh 
barb  here s the latest one 
 we all know you grew pubes
over the summer  
i mean  my daughter can t help it if
she s developing a little early for her age 
  you think that s nice 
  well  that s not like her at all 
she s usually very sweet 
as you may know  her mother isn t well 
maybe this is how she s dealing with it 
barb  i m very sorry about
your family situation  mr  king   
    but my daughter comes home
from school in tears 
yeah  no  i get it  i m sorry 
barb  scottie s the one
who should be sorry 
i want her to come
over and apologize   
    and i don t ever want her
to text my daughter again 
if she doesn t apologize 
i ll take it up with the dean 
you can t buy your way out of this 
can you give me an address 
thank you for coming by 
hi 
i forgot to mention scottie said she didn t
wanna be lani s partner at the rock wall   
   because she didn t wanna fall
into my daughter s butt crack 
  that doesn t even make sense 
matt  ah 
man  on tv  
shirts off  shirts off 
good  good  good  good job 
i don t think she has any idea 
that was very good  bobby brown 
yeah  here 
because she goes   i m living at this 
i ll meet you out in front   so   
scottie  you have something
you wanna say to lani 
sorry 
  it s okay  man  he knows
he s going away for a while 
  if he s got a chance  he s bolting 
  great  well  it was nice meeting you both 
you should come over for a swim
or a hike or something  okay 
barb 
i don t think she s sorry at all 
  she s gonna keep on doing it  i can tell 
matt  no  she won t 
look  scottie  you re gonna stop  right 
and you re really  really sorry  right 
man  seems like every time i forget to pray
  we don t catch a guy for three days 
i know  i m telling you  man 
barb  oh  and  mr  king 
  yeah 
good luck with the sale 
they say your decision will have a major
impact on hawaii s real estate world 
not to mention the whole landscape
of kauai 
hundreds of millions of dollars  yeah 
yeah  it s a big decision 
barb  my husband s family s from kauai 
hanapepe  born and bred 
  they hope you don t sell 
  you don t say 
all that traffic it s gonna make 
matt  as if liz s coma
weren t enough already   
    the whole goddamn state
is following my decision   
    on who s gonna buy 25 000
pristine acres on kauai   
    that my family has owned
since the 1860s 
a lot of my cousins are broke  and
the sale will make us all very  very rich 
my family meets in six days
to approve a buyer 
but ever since my father died 
i m the sole trustee   
    which means i alone
hold all the cards 
my great great grandmother was
princess margaret ke alohilani   
    one of the last direct
descendants of king kamehameha 
she was originally supposed
to marry her cousin   
    but she fell in love with edward
king  her haole banker   
    whose parents had
been missionaries 
between his land deals
and her huge inheritance   
    generations of their
descendants  all of us   
    have watched the past unfurl millions
into our laps through leases and sales 
now something called
the rule against perpetuities   
    is forcing us to
dissolve the trust   
    and we re selling our last huge
parcel of virgin hawaiian land 
unlike a lot of my cousins  i haven t
blown my share of the trust money 
just like my father before me   
    i live only on the income
from my law practice 
i don t want my daughters growing up
spoiled and entitled 
liz always accuses me of stinginess 
but i agree with my father 
you give your children enough money to do
something  but not enough to do nothing 
noe 
matt 
your cousins are here 
matt  not only am i the sole trustee  but i
specialize in real estate transaction law   
    so a few of the more involved cousins
have been meeting with me to analyze bids 
all  hey 
hal  how s it  matt 
matt  cousin hal  cousin
milo  cousin stan   
    cousin six  cousin wink 
cousin connie   
how you doing  okay 
matt      and cousin dave  both
of whom oppose the sale entirely 
  good to see you 
matt  don t be fooled by appearances 
in hawaii  some of the most powerful
people look like bums and stuntmen 
all right  so where are we 
matt 
proposals are virtually the same 
hotels  shopping centers  condos
and golf courses 
i have some major concerns   
matt  a chicago group
is offering half a billion dollars 
but we re leaning towards a lower bid
from a guy named don holitzer 
he s actually from kauai 
made a fortune in silicon valley 
old cousin hugh is pushing us in
that direction  and i say  why not 
the money would come from hawaii
and stay in hawaii 
stan  there s nothing about saving
the heiau  you know  it s ridiculous 
and there s no beach access like they say 
and that s really  really   
matt  elizabeth s gonna make it
out okay  i know it 
it s not her time yet 
she ll wake up 
scottie and alexandra
will have their mother back 
and we ll talk about our marriage 
i know i can make things right 
i ll sell the land  quit my practice
  and buy her whatever she wants 
a big boat  a house in france 
we ll take a trip around the world 
just the two of us 
we ll get close again 
like the early days 
johnston 
i wish i had better news  matthew 
but dr  chun and dr  mueller and i
agree that her condition   
   it s deteriorating 
she has no eye movement 
she has no pupillary responses   
   she has no brain stem reflexes
whatsoever 
i mean  the machines can keep her alive  but
the quality of her life would be so poor 
basically the way it is now 
she ll never be the way she was  matt 
never 
we know that now 
look  uh   
i can t tell you how sorry i am
to tell you this 
and you do have your daughters 
there s just nothing more
that we can do 
so if we do go ahead
and take her off the machines   
there s no  if  
it s  when   i have a legal obligation 
you know that 
how long will she last 
well  it s hard to say 
it could be a few days 
it could be a couple of weeks 
for planning purposes  i think you should
work off the shortest possible scenario 
i know i ve gotta get the ball rolling
on the organ donations right away 
matt 
elizabeth has many friends 
she has a big life 
if you re gonna let everybody know
to say goodbye   
   which is the typical protocol
for these situations  you start now 
then when the last day comes   
   they ll feel more ready 
or as ready as they can feel
for something like this 
i m so sorry  matt 
 ekg beeping 
kai  hey 
mark  hey  there he is 
kai  how s it going 
  what s going on 
she was looking a little pale lately 
all cooped up here 
i know she d be mortified if nobody helped
her out with some lipstick and blush 
i know she ll grill me 
of course  kai s getting her caught up
on the latest gossip 
kai  well  i don t wanna start
from scratch later 
oh  and  matt  uh  on the way here   
   we stopped by and put some meals
in your fridge  all ready to nuke 
  thanks 
kai  mm hm 
so  what s the latest  anyway  matt 
any updates 
just more of the same 
just keeping the kidneys
and other vital organs working   
   and hoping for the best 
the food at the club is so good 
yeah  they do a good job here 
come here 
scottie 
mm 
why is it called a jellyfish 
it s not a fish  it s not jelly 
i have no idea 
you ask good questions  scottie 
you re getting too smart for me 
i m gonna ask mom when she wakes up 
do you think she s gonna know everything
she used to 
i don t know 
 hawaiian music playing
over speakers 
i ll be right back 
  hi  matt  hi  scottie 
matt  troy 
so  what s going on 
i mean  how s elizabeth doing 
the same 
well  you know 
i went and visited her last week   
   and  uh  she looked pretty good 
  then why d you ask 
troy  i don t know 
i guess i just wanted to know
what the latest is 
you know  i ve been praying for her every
day  you guys  really hard  seriously 
and  well  what i meant to say was
when i was there  i talked to her   
   and she moved her hand 
and then i was  like    i was encouraged 
i thought that
that was an encouraging sign 
that s enough 
  i really think she heard me 
  look  troy  go to your friends 
there s no hard feelings 
let s just leave it alone 
i told you  matt 
the water that day was so choppy 
i ve told you a hundred times 
what happened to her
could ve happened to me 
the ocean was brutal that day 
ask anybody 
you weren t supposed to be driving 
she was supposed to be driving 
she wanted me to drive 
she s the one that told me
to pass the other boat before the turn 
you know 
it s just your whole attitude towards me 
i didn t   
you know  i feel terrible about it 
plus  i almost drowned myself
when the boat caps   
hey 
scottie  hey  scottie  scottie 
hey  listen 
don t pay any attention to that guy 
  that guy s a dope 
scottie  i hate him 
yeah  i know 
hey  let s do something crazy 
let s drive to the airport 
we ll hop over to the big island   
   and we ll surprise your sister 
what do you say 
  right now 
  yeah  it ll be fun  she s not expecting us 
and we can bring her home 
i think she should be with us  don t you 
don t you miss her  i miss her 
yeah  i mean  i m out of school 
she should be too 
there you go  okay 
let s go  come on 
hey  troy 
matt  somehow it feels natural to find
a daughter of mine on a different island 
a family seems exactly
like an archipelago 
all part of the same whole
but still separate and alone   
    and always drifting
slowly apart 
that s the wrong door 
go back to sleep  braelynn  it s okay 
 knocking on door

real good job you re doing 
that s part of why i brought you here 
you have to help me 
i don t know what to do with her 
maybe if you spent more time with her 
she wouldn t act like such a complete spaz 
get her out of town  go camp on kauai 
that s what mom used to do with me
whenever i was losing it 
hey  listen  no  listen  listen to me 
  your mother s not well 
  yeah  obviously 
no 
they just told me she s not gonna wake up 
we know for sure now 
the doctors are gonna stop caring
for her 
your mother wanted it this way 
she has this   
she has this will  see 
that says that we have to do it this way 
we both do 
you understand what i m saying 
that s why i got you 
honey  we re letting her go 
 sobs 
 crying 
why did you have to tell me
in the goddamn pool 
alex  alex 
what 
what do you want 
uh   
 sighs 
i just found out yesterday 
we have to go through this thing together 
you and scottie and me 
and i have to go around
and tell people what s happening 
family and a few close friends 
sometimes i m gonna need you
to come with me 
sometimes i need you to watch scottie 
you want me to go around with you
and tell people that mom s gonna die 
what s the point of that 
breaking the news  watching them cry 
dealing with their emotions 
how depressing is that gonna be 
just call them 
alex  nobody wants to do any of this 
but we have to tell your grandpa and tutu
and a few friends 
they have the right to know 
and they have the right to say goodbye 
i don t wanna talk about mom
with anyone 
look  whatever you two fought about
over christmas  you have to drop it 
grow up 
you love your mother 
your mother loves you 
  i can t drop it 
  you have to 
you really don t have a clue  do you 
dad   
dad  mom was cheating on you 
that is what we fought about 
when i was home at christmas 
i caught her with a guy 
it made me sick to see her near you 
i went back to school thinking that
that was it  that i was just done with her 
i was gonna call
and tell you everything and   
and then the accident happened and   
i was waiting until she woke up  i guess 
 sobbing 
you didn t even suspect  right 
right 
it disgusted me too 
you re always so busy 
 caught her with a guy  
what does that mean 
i was on my way to swim
in the black point pool with brandy   
   and suddenly i see mom and
some douche bag walking into a house 
his house  i guess 
just some guy  it could be anybody 
no  he had his hand on her ass 
it was gross 
  then what 
  then nothing 
then they went into the house 
a few days later 
i told her i knew what she was doing 
and 
and first  she acted like she had no idea
what i was talking about 
like i m fucking blind 
and then she got  like  super mad
and yelled and denied it 
that was when i decided that
i didn t want anything more to do with her 
who is he 
i don t know  some guy 
what s he look like 
dark hair 
matt 
oh 
watch your sister 
hello 
kai 
mark 
it s me  matt 
  hey 
kai  no  it s not 
  i m just saying you always wanna have   
mark  i m not a mind reader 
  hello 
kai  wait  hello 
it s me  it s matt 
  oh  hey  matt 
matt  is this a bad time 
uh  no  no  we re just fighting 
uh  come on in  you want coffee 
you want something to drink 
matt 
no  thanks 
mark  fighting about something stupid 
kai  it s not stupid 
mark 
it is stupid 
kai 
he wants us to throw parties   
   and have people over  which we do 
but who winds up doing the work 
  me  i do 
mark  you don t have to do anything 
  that s the whole point 
kai  i do 
it doesn t have to be work 
you don t have to clean and buy an outfit 
  i m supposed to be disgusting  ugh 
  and think up a goddamn theme cocktail 
we could just invite people over
to hang out and drink whatever we have 
  let s talk about it later 
  oh  shit  matt  is everything okay 
is there any news 
in fact  there is  i ll tell you
about it in a minute  who is he 
does she love him 
who is he 
matt   
i m sorry to put you in that position  but i m
not really the one who put you there  am i 
i d like to know who the guy is
that my wife was seeing 
  you re angry 
  you have very keen powers of observation 
you know what 
i think we should talk about this later 
you need to cool it 
is it troy  that fucking neanderthal 
you don t know him 
kai  mark  don t you even  shame on you 
you re supposed to be her friend 
mark  well  guess what 
i m matt s friend too  okay 
and this is a unique and dramatic
situation  and i would wanna know 
yeah  well  don t betray her
when she s not even here to defend herself 
matt  look  you might not be able
to hear this right now   
   but it s not her fault 
your marriage was not   
just    she was lonely 
so you re gonna talk to me
in clichés about women 
nothing is ever a woman s fault 
was it still going on
when she had the accident 
but i stayed out of it 
any time kai would bring it up 
i would walk away 
you what 
probably egged her on 
add a little drama in your life
without any actual risk 
who do you think you re protecting  kai 
she doesn t need your protection 
it s over  she s gonna die 
don t say that 
matt 
it s true  i was gonna tell you yesterday 
she s never gonna wake up 
you hear me 
do you understand what i m saying 
she s gone 
we re pulling the plug 
you were putting lipstick on a corpse 
 crying 
mark 
come on  matt 
that s a little intense 
 sighs 
does she love him 
how can you ask about him
when she s gonna die 
who cares 
yes  she loves him  loved him  whatever 
she was crazy about him 
she was gonna   
she was gonna ask you for a divorce 
you still haven t told me who he is 
i guess it doesn t matter 
mark 
matt  matt 
brian speer 
his name s brian speer  with two e s 
 matt crying 
 alexandra laughing 
alexandra 
they re just  like  cheap 
they re just like 
 get it over with  cut corners  
hi  daddy 
  dad  this is  uh  sid 
matt  hello  sid 
what s up  bro 
don t ever do that to me again 
we re gonna see your grandparents 
and  scottie 
auntie esther s gonna come watch you 
dad  sid s coming with us  okay 
yeah  listen  sid  uh   
   what s going on this week
is a family matter  you understand 
sid s not gonna be interested
in meeting your grandparents 
he s gonna be bored stiff 
dad  i told you
that he was gonna be with me 
i ll be a lot more civil with him around 
what can i say 
it s like reading korean 
matt  scott  if you want to 
i can walk you through it 
jibber jabber 
it s an advance directive 
it s basically her instructions
on what procedures she wants 
  in this case   
  i know goddamn well what it says 
says she doesn t want us sitting around
watching her spoil like milk 
says if there s nothing the doctors can do 
she d rather just get on with it 
elizabeth had the good sense
to write this thing here 
she was always a thoughtful girl 
a strong girl 
hell of a lot stronger than her brother 
barry whines his way through life 
might even be a homosexual 
for all i know 
matt  yeah  scott  i don t think so 
  and she s stronger than you  matt 
she lived more in a year
than you lived in a decade   
   sitting in that office 
hoarding all your cash 
all that money you refuse to use 
what the hell good is it 
now you and your family are getting ready
to cash in your chips  what the hell for 
maybe if you let my baby
have her own boat   
   bought her safe equipment   
   maybe let her go
on those shopping sprees women like   
   maybe she wouldn t have gone in
for those thrill sports 
maybe if you d provided more thrills
at home 
and you  alexandra 
putting your mother through hell   
   when all she was trying to do
was instill sense and drive in you 
shame on you  shame on you 
you should try to be more like her 
she was a good girl 
she was a good girl 
 exhales

 laughing

holitzer  chicago group a distant second

most of us  anyway 
go ahead  captain  make it official 
it s strange  is all 
hugh 
what s strange 
we didn t do anything to own this land 
it was entrusted to us 
and now we re just   
i can t do it  i m not gonna do it 
hugh  what do you mean 
  i m not gonna sign 
what are you doing  man 
we know you got a lot on your plate now 
but you re not gonna fuck this up for us 
it s over 
i don t want it to go to holitzer 
i don t want it to go to anyone 
i wanna keep it 
your head s not right  mattie 
your head s not right 
want a couple of days to think about it 
take a couple of days 
i don t need a couple of days 
i have the authority 
and this is what i want 
we have other businesses
that we re converting into corporations 
  we can figure this out 
  you re the trustee  mattie 
you know better than anyone
we only have seven years left 
then i have seven years
to figure out how to keep it 
 chuckles 
we ll come after you  man 
just because you re a fucking lawyer   
   doesn t mean the rest of us
will be afraid to come after you 
but nobody wants to do that 
we re family 
people will be relieved  hugh 
the whole state 
  oh  shit 
matt  i sign this document   
   and something that we were supposed
to protect is gone forever 
now  we re haole as shit 
and we go to private schools and clubs   
   and we can barely speak pidgin 
let alone hawaiian 
but we ve got hawaiian blood 
and we re tied to this land 
and our children are tied to this land 
now  it s a miracle that
for some bullshit reason 150 years ago   
   we own this much of paradise 
but we do 
and for whatever bullshit reason 
i m the trustee now   
   and i m not signing 
i m not signing it 
so if you wanna sue me 
it ll just make us closer

on him 
i d already smelled it 
i finally got it out of him 
and we have been going crazy ever since 
not easy with the kids around 
it s all just something
i could never have imagined 
and then your family s decision
with the land   
   i think you re doing the right thing 
but brian is   
it s just so complicated and confusing 
i know 
i m angry 
but i m just so sorry

well  i guess that s it 
freeman  on tv   there are few places
harder to get to in this world   
    but there aren t any
where it s harder to live 
the average temperature here
at the bottom of the earth   
    is a balmy 58 degrees below   
  one strawberry 
freeman      when the sun is out 
one mocha chip 
freeman  it wasn t always like this 
  great 
freeman  antarctica used
to be a tropical place   
    densely forested and
teeming with life 
but then the continent
started to drift south   
    and by the time it
was done drifting   
    the dense forests had all been
replaced with a new ground cover  ice 
as for the former inhabitants 
they d all died or moved on long ago 
well  almost all of them 
the emperor penguin
is technically a bird   
    although one that makes his home
in the sea 
so if you re wondering what he s
doing up here on the ice   
    well  that s part of our story 
each year at around the same time   
    he will leave the comfort
of his ocean home   
    and embark on a
remarkable journey 
he will travel a great distance 
and though he is a
bird  he won t fly 
though he lives in the sea 
he won t swim
