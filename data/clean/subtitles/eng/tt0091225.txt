me to be a doctor 
a plastic surgeon 
making big bucks doing

the real world  on the streets 
so  i wrote songs at night and
did construction work by day 
wow  that sounds great 
you know  i write songs  too 
what kind of   
listen  it doesn t matter

things touch my feathers 
 oil of night fowl and him  
i wrote that
 giggles 
jeez  howard 
it sort of sounds
like you sold out 
maybe  but  sometimes 
i still get this feeling
there s some kind of special
destiny waiting for me 
howard  that s it 
maybe that s why you re here 
i mean  i believe that there are
no accidents in the universe 
maybe you re here
for some greater purpose 
some cosmic cause 
are you nuts 
 yawning 
i got no intention
of being stranded here 
i gotta get back 
how is another matter

the evolutionary ladder 
showing how man progressed
from monkey to   
me  for instance 
you consider that progress 
jeez  you re all hairless apes 
that s really disgusting 
now  i want you both to imagine 
somewhere in the universe
is howard s world 
picture it in your mind 
a world almost
exactly like ours 
except that the progenitor
of the dominant species
was not a monkey  but a duck 
some theory 
every school duck
knows this stuff 
and as the duck
climbed up
the evolutionary ladder 
he said adios to his wings 
his mental capacity increases 
he begins to develop   
beverly 
shopping malls 
 chuckles 
no  tribes 
cro magnum duck 
who ultimately evolves into
howard

 sighs

 exclaims 
my god 
this relationship  it defies
all the laws of nature 
no  it doesn t
this is not what you think 
we re just very good friends 
 exclaims 
phil 
oh  i m sorry 
the door was open 
who the hell are they 
this is my friend carter  and this is dr 
walter jenning 
and i told  em
all about you  howard 
you were obviously right 
show him the evidence 
what evidence 
we tested them  and they re
both from the same fowl 
you  howard 
my feathers 
howard  howard 
don t go berserk  no 
on my planet  we never
say die  we say kill 
now  wait a minute  listen
to me  small visitor 
i can explain how you got here 
hmm  
carter  dr  jenning is in charge of
the astrophysics lab at dynatechnics 
now  on the night
of september 8   
that s the night
that howard landed 
yes  now  on that night 
we were initiating
our first full scale test
of the laser spectroscope 
this was shot
during the experiment 
it was just a routine
procedure meant to measure
the density of the gases
that surround alpha centauri 
however  partway through
the experiment 
there was a deviation and we lost
control of the laser spectroscope 
what do you mean  lost control 
some unknown force was redirecting the
laser beam from its original target
so that it hit
your planet instead 
hit my planet  how about
hit my living room 
talk about an
invasion of privacy 
when the beam hit  you
must have been caught up
in a massive energy inversion
which literally
dragged you through space
back to the power source
here on earth 
radical 
jenning  in the lab that night 
we saw a single feather fall 
oh 
we weren t aware that
the rest of you  howard 
had landed in that alley
just 2 miles away 
any questions 
yeah  where are my pants 
howard  where are you going 
to this lab of theirs 
what for  
to hop back onboard
that laser thing 
then all you have to do is hit the reverse
lever to send me back home  right 
well  we hadn t considered
reversing the process 
i don t think it s feasible 
me either 
now  wait a minute 
if we could generate
a strong enough hypercharge   
you can t do that
you mean the reflex mode might
provoke a total reversal 
it just might be possible 
it won t work 
yeah 
sir   
don t listen to them  howard 
i have got you booked
on a m  cleveland 
we can get the cover
of science digest   
butt out  four eyes 
beverly  yeah 
look  you guys  could you
really send him back 
jenning  if we did  we could
establish a continuing link
between our planets 
but he would have to leave tonight 
while the alignment still exists 
we can t afford to wait 
you mean i m finally
gonna breeze this flytrap 
ducky  this is what you wanted 
you re going home 
yeah 
jenning  right 
carter  call larry  have him set
up the initiation procedure 
tell him i ll meet him
at the lab right away 
you and blumburtt
can bring howard 
you are about to make history a
second time  my little friend 
thanks  but once was plenty 
get to it 
right 
you know  howard  we could
hold out for a pbs special   
phil 
howard  bev  get dressed

bev   
i m not a real sentimental guy 
no  i bet you were born from
a very hardboiled egg  ducky 
yeah 
but i do keep wondering   
of all the alleys in the world i
could have fallen into that night 
why did it have to be yours 
because  right now 
you re the one and only thing
that s making it very
hard for me to leave 
 phone ringing 
there s no guard 
oh  we should

come on  come on 
beverly  howard 
where are you going 
larry  where s dr  jenning 
carter  come here 
let me show you this 
he was pre activating
the laser spectroscope 
uh huh 
we lost control again and
there was another explosion 
and jenning caught the full
force of the blast this time 
is he all right 
where is he 
you see  the bottom of the
spectroscope blew into the wall 
and jenning just   
just disappeared 
excuse me  but is this
gonna delay my takeoff 
is that   
is that it 
that s unbelievable 
yeah  we brought howard down
the first time  but what if   
oh  my god  larry  what if we ve
brought down something else this time 
we re rounding up all the
scientists for you in the lab  sir 
but i think you d better take a
look at this other thing first 
a thing  hanson 
is that the kind of precise
descriptive techniques
they re teaching rookies
nowadays  a thing 
i want to know what they re
doing with howard
