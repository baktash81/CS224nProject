 kip

please  keep going 
dead on  dead on 
yes 
before we get started on our new project 
i have a few concerns 
first off  i m concerned about
your transportation situation 
i mean  do you   you got a car
you can borrow from someone 
well  that s the problem
right now 
at the moment 
nothing comes to mind 
you can borrow my van for the time being 
i   i do better on foot anyway 
we also need some way to make us
look official  like we got all the answers 
how about some gold bracelets 
we need  like 
some name tags   
with our picture on it 
all laminated and whatnot 
i mean  we gotta
look legit  man 
that s true  that s true 
say  you know of a   a place
we can get our picture taken   
like a   a photo store 
okay 
turn your head
on more of a slant 
now  make a fist   
and slowly ease it up
underneath your chin 
  this is looking really good 
  you can say that again 
 deb 
okay  hold still right there 
now  just imagine
you re weightless 
you re in the middle
of the ocean   
surrounded by
tiny little sea horses 
 shutter clicks 
that was the one  i think
that s gonna come out really nice 
 chuckles 
uh  you did it 
wow  wow  that felt
really relaxed

yes 
probably the best
that i know of 
just draw a picture of the girl
you want to take out   
and give it to her
for  like  a gift or something 
that s a pretty good idea 
now  if you invest
in the 24 piece set
