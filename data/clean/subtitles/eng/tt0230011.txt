now  we ve all heard
of the legend of atlantis 
a continent somewhere
in the mid atlantic
that was home
to an advanced civilization 
possessing technology
far beyond our own 
that  according to our friend plato here 
was suddenly struck
by some cataclysmic event
that sank it beneath the sea 
now  some of you may ask 
why atlantis 
it s just a myth  isn t it 
pure fantasy 
well  that is where you d be wrong 
10 000 years
before the egyptians built the pyramids 
atlantis had electricity 
advanced medicine 
even the power of flight 
impossible  you say 
well  no  no  not for them 
numerous ancient cultures
all over the globe agree
that atlantis possessed
a power source of some kind
more powerful than steam  than coal 
more powerful than our modern
internal combustion engines 
gentlemen  i propose
that we find atlantis 
find that power source 
and bring it back to the surface 
now  this is a page
from an illuminated text
that describes a book called
the shepherd s journal 
said to have been
a firsthand account of atlantis
and its exact whereabouts 
now  based on a centuries old
translation of a norse text 
historians have believed
the journal resides in ireland 
but after comparing the text
to the runes on this viking shield 
i found that one of the letters
had been mistranslated 
so  by changing this letter
and inserting the correct one 
we find that the shepherd s journal 
the key to atlantis 
lies not in ireland  gentlemen 
but in iceland 
pause for effect 
gentlemen  i ll take your questions now 
would you gentlemen
please excuse me for a moment 
cartography and linguistics 
milo thatch speaking 
yeah  just a second 
pardon me  mr  hickenbottom 
how s that  is that better 
yeah  you re welcome 
  and don t let it happen again 
  all right  bye 
now  as you can see by the   
by this map   
map that   
that i ve drawn  i plotted the route
that will take myself and a crew
to the southern coast of iceland
to retrieve the journal 
showtime 
well  this is it 
i am finally getting out of the dungeon 
 dear mr  thatch  this is to inform you 
 that your meeting today has been
moved up from 4 30 p m  to 3 30 p m

 the board has voted
to reject your proposal  
 have a nice weekend 
mr  harcourt s office  
they can t do this to me 
i swear  that young thatch
gets crazier every year 
if i ever hear the word  atlantis  again

please  mr  harcourt 
stop  sir  if you    could you hold   
thank you very much  look at   
this museum funds
scientific expeditions
based on facts 
not legends and folklore 
besides  we need you here 
  we depend on you 
  you do 
yes  what with winter coming 
that boiler s going to need
a lot of attention 
  boiler 
  onward  heinz 
but there    there s a journal

sir  i really hoped
it wouldn t come to this 
but this is a letter of resignation 
if you reject my proposal  i ll   
i ll quit 
i mean it  sir 
if you refuse to fund my proposal   
you ll what 
flush your career down the toilet 
just like your grandfather 
you have a lot of potential  milo 
don t throw it all away
chasing fairy tales 
but i can prove atlantis exists 
you want to go on an expedition 
here  take a trolley
to the potomac and jump in 
maybe the cold water will
clear your head  heinz 
i m home 
fluffy  here  kitty 
milo james thatch 
who    who are you 
how did you get in here 
i came down the chimney 
my name is helga sinclair 
i m acting on behalf of my employer 
who has a most intriguing
proposition for you 
are you interested 
your employer 
who is your employer 
this way  please 
and don t drip on the caravaggio 
step lively 
mr  whitmore does not like
to be kept waiting 
you will address him
as  mr  whitmore  or  sir  
you will stand unless
asked to be seated 
keep your sentences short
and to the point 
are we clear 
and relax 
he doesn t bite    often 
grandpa 
finest explorer i ever met 
preston whitmore 
pleasure to meet you  milo 
join me in a little yoga 
no  no  thank you 
did you really know my grandfather 
oh  yeah  met old thaddeus
back in georgetown 
class of  66  we stayed close friends
till the end of his days 
even dragged me along
on some of his danged fool expeditions 
thatch was crazy as a fruit bat  he was 
he spoke of you often 
funny  he never mentioned you 
he wouldn t 
he knew how much i like my privacy 
i keep a low profile 
mr  whitmore  should i be
wondering why i m here 
look on that table 
it s for you 
it s from my grandfather 
he brought that package
to me years ago 
he said if anything
were to happen to him 
i should give it to you
when you were ready 
whatever that means 
it   
it can t be 
it s the shepherd s journal 
mr  whitmore  this journal is the key
to finding the lost continent of atlantis 
atlantis 
i wasn t born yesterday  son 
no  no  no  look  look at this 
coordinates  clues  it s all right here 
yeah  looks like gibberish to me 
that s because it s been written
in a dialect that no longer exists 
  so it s useless 
  no  no  just difficult 
i ve spent my whole life
studying dead languages 
it s not gibberish to me 
it s probably a fake 
mr  whitmore 
my grandfather would have known
if this were a fake  i would know 
i will stake everything i own 
everything that i believe in 
that this is
the genuine shepherd s journal 
all right  all right 
so  what do you want to do with it 
well  i ll get funding 
  i mean  i ll    the museum   
  they ll never believe you 
i ll show them  i will make them believe 
like you did today 
yes  well  no  how did you   
forget about them  okay  never mind 
i will find atlantis on my own 
i mean  if i have to rent a rowboat 
congratulations  milo 
this is exactly what i wanted to hear 
but forget the rowboat  son 
we ll travel in style 
it s all been arranged 
the whole ball of wax 
why 
for years  your granddad bent my ear
with stories about that old book 
i didn t buy it for a minute 
so  finally  i got fed up
and i made a bet with the old coot 
i said   thatch  if you ever
actually find that so called journal  
 not only will i finance the expedition  
 but i ll kiss you full on the mouth  
imagine my embarrassment
when he found the darn thing 
now  i know
your grandfather s gone  milo 
god rest his soul 
but preston whitmore
is a man who keeps his word 
you hear that  thatch 
i m going to the afterlife
with a clear conscience  by thunder 
your grandpa was a great man 
you probably don t realize how great 
those buffoons at the museum
dragged him down 
made a laughing stock of him 
he died a broken man 
if i could bring back
just one shred of proof 
that d be enough for me 
thatch 
what are we standing around for 
we got work to do 
but  mr  whitmore 
you know  in order to do
what you re proposing 
you re gonna need a crew 
taken care of 
you ll need engineers and geologists 
got  em all  the best of the best 
gaetan moliere 
geology and excavation 
the man has a nose for dirt 
vincenzo santorini  demolitions 
busted him out of a turkish prison 
audrey ramirez 
don t let her age fool you 
she s forgotten more about engines
than you and i will ever know 
they re the same crew that
brought the journal back 
  where was it 
  iceland 
i knew it  i knew it 
all we need now is
an expert in gibberish 
so  it s decision time 
you can build on
the foundation your grandfather left you
or you can go back to your boiler room 
  this is for real 
  now you re catching on 
all right  okay  i ll have to quit my job

welcome to the bridge  mr  thatch 
okay  everybody 
i want you to give mr  thatch
your undivided attention 
good afternoon 
can everyone hear me okay 
okay  how about some slides 
the first slide is
a depiction of a creature 
a creature so frightening
that sailors were said
to be driven mad by the mere sight of it 
i m sorry  that s wrong 
geez  i used to take lunch money
from guys like this 
anyway  this    okay 
this is an illustration of the leviathan 
the creature guarding
the entrance to atlantis 
with something like that 
i would have white wine  i think 
it s a mythical sea serpent 
he s described in the book of job 
the bible says 
 out of his mouth go burning lights  
 sparks of fire shoot out  
but more likely  it s a carving or
a sculpture to frighten the superstitious 
so we find this masterpiece 
then what 
when do we dig 
actually  we don t have to dig 
you see  according to the journal 
the path to atlantis
will take us down a tunnel
at the bottom of the ocean 
and we ll come up a curve
into an air pocket right here 
where we ll find the remnants
of an ancient highway
that will lead us to atlantis 
kind of like the grease trap in your sink 
cartographer  linguist  plumber 
hard to believe he s still single 
  you said there d be digging 
  go away  mole 
captain  you d better
come look at this  sir 
okay  class dismissed

there are ships here from every era 
commander  i think
you should hear this

 enter the lair of the leviathan  
commander

to the gateway  
  commander 
  yes  mrs  packard  what is it 
i m picking up something
on the hydrophone 
  i think you should hear 
  put it on speakers 
what is it  a pod of whales 
bigger 
it sounds metallic 
could be an echo off one of the rocks 
do you want to do my job  be my guest 
is it just me  or is that getting louder 
well  whatever it was  it s gone now 
helmsman  bring us about 
tighten our search pattern
and slow us to   
out of the way 
tell cookie to melt the butter
and break out the bibs 
i want this lobster served up
on a silver platter

fire torpedoes 
get me the bridge 
sir  it s engineering on four 
rourke  we took a big hit down here 
and we re taking on water fast 
i don t want to be around

roger  20 degrees down angle 
right behind you 
  sacré bleu 
  we re getting killed out here

seven hours ago 
we started this expedition
with 200 of the finest men and women
i ve ever known 
we re all that s left 
i won t sugarcoat it  gentlemen 
we have a crisis on our hands 
but we ve been up
this particular creek before 
and we ve always come through 
paddle or no paddle 
i see no reason
to change that policy now 
from here on in 
everyone pulls double duty 
everyone drives  everyone works 
looks like all our chances for survival
rest with you  mr  thatch 
you and that little book 
we re all gonna die 
okay  people  saddle up 
lieutenant  i want this convoy
moving five minutes ago 
moliere  you re on point

you know the rules  i want you 50 yards
behind that truck at all times 
and  packard  put out that cigarette 
are you sure you re checked out
on this class of vehicle 
can you drive a truck 
of course i can drive a truck 
i mean  sure  you got your steering 
and your gas  and your brake 
and of course  this metal looking thing 
okay  so it was a bumper car
at coney island 
but it s the same basic principle 
come on  move it 
sorry about    sorry about that 
come on  civilian 
you didn t just drink that  did you 
that s not good 
that s nitroglycerin 
don t move 
don t breathe 
don t do anything  except pray  maybe 
boom 
yeah 
good night 
will you look at the size of this 
it s gotta be half a mile high  at least 
it must have taken hundred   
no  thousands of years
to carve this thing 
hey  look  i made a bridge 
it only took me  like  what 
10 seconds  11  tops 
looks like we have a little roadblock 
vinny  what do you think 
i could un roadblock that
if i had about 200 of these 
problem is  i only got about 10 
plus  you know  five of my own 
and a couple of cherry bombs 
a road flare 
hey  too bad we don t have
some nitroglycerin  milo 
looks like we re gonna have to dig 
it will be my pleasure 
stupid   
stupid 
i don t understand it 
i just tuned this thing up this morning 
it looks like the rotor s shot 
i m gonna have to pull
a spare from one of the trucks 
  can i   
  no toques nada 
i ll be right back 
she lives 
hey  what d you do 
well  you know  the boiler in this baby
is a humac model p 54 stroke 813 
now  we got the 814
back at the museum 
the heating cores
on the whole humac line
have always been a little 
you know  temperamental 
so sometimes you gotta    boom 
persuade  em a little 
yeah  yeah  thank you very much 
shut up 
two for flinching 
this is it  it s gotta be 
all right  we ll make camp here 
why is it glowing 
it is a natural phosphorescence 
that thing is going to
keep me up all night  i know it 
come and get it 
for the appetizer  caesar salad 
escargot  and your oriental spring rolls 
  yuck 
  i wanted the escargot 
knock yourself out 
there you go  milo

thanks  cookie 
that looks greasier than usual 
you like it  well  have some more 
you re so skinny 
if you turned sideways
and stuck out your tongue 
you d look like a zipper 
you know 
we ve been pretty tough on the kid 
what do you say
we cut him some slack 
yeah  you re right 
hey  milo 
why don t you come sit with us 
really  you don t mind 
nah  park it here 
gee  this is great 
i mean  you know 
it s an honor to be included in your   
  mole 
  forgive me 
i could not resist 
hey  milo 
don t you ever close that book 
yeah  you must ve read it
a dozen times by now 
i know  but this   
this doesn t make any sense 
see  in this passage here  the shepherd
seems to be leading up to something 
he calls it the heart of atlantis 
it could be the power source
the legends refer to 
but then  it just    it cuts off 
it s almost like there s a missing page 
kid  relax 
we don t get paid overtime 
i know  i know 
sometimes i get a little carried away 
but hey  you know 
that s what this is all about  right 
i mean  discovery 
teamwork  adventure 
unless  maybe   
you re just in it for the money 
  money 
  money 
i m gonna say    money 
well  i guess
i set myself up for that one 
what  is something
wrong with your neck 
oh  yeah  i must ve hurt it when   
better 
yeah 
hey  how d you learn how to do that 
  an arapaho medicine man 
  get outta here 
born and raised with  em 
my father was an army medic 
he settled down in the kansas
territory after he met my mother 
  no kidding 
  nope 
i got a sheepskin from howard u 
and a bearskin from old iron cloud 
halfway through medical school 
i was drafted 
one day i m studying gross anatomy
in the classroom 
the next  i m sewing up rough riders
on san juan hill 
main course 
i couldn t eat another bite 
i m watching my weight 
don t you worry 
it ll keep and keep and keep 
thank god i lost my sense of taste
years ago 
aren t you going to pitch up your tent 
i did 
i guess i m still a little rusty at this 
i haven t gone camping since   
well  since the last time
my grandpa took me 
i never got to meet your grandfather 
what was he like 
where do you start 
he was like a father to me  really 
my parents died when i was
a little kid  and he took me in 
what 
well  i was just thinking 
one time  when i was eight 
we were hiking along this stream 
and i saw something
shining in the water 
it was a genuine arrowhead 
well  you d think i d found
a lost civilization
the way grandpa carried on about it 
it wasn t until i was older
that i realized that the arrowhead
was just some compressed shale
mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured
into an isosceletic triangulate 
that is so cute 
say  audrey  no offense 
but how does a teenager
become the chief mechanic
of a multimillion dollar expedition 
well  i took this job
when my dad retired 
but the funny thing was
he always wanted sons  right 
one to run his machine shop
and the other
to be middleweight boxing champion 
but he got my sister and me instead 
so  what happened to your sister 
she s 24 0 with a shot
at the title next month 
anyway  i m saving up
so my papi and i
can open another shop 
forget your jammies  mrs  packard 
i sleep in the nude 
you re gonna want a pair of these 
she sleepwalks 
well  as far as me goes 
i just like to blow things up 
come on  vinny  tell the kid the truth 
my family owned a flower shop 
we would sell roses 
carnations  baby s breath  you name it 
one day  i m making
about three dozen corsages
for this prom 
you know  the one
they put on their wrist 
and everybody  they come 
 where is it  
 when is it  
 does it match my dress  
it s a nightmare 
anyway  i guess
there was this leak next door
of gas or what  boom 
no more chinese laundry 
blew me right through the front window 
it was like a sign from god 
i found myself that boom 
what s mole s story 
trust me on this one 
you don t wanna know 
audrey  don t tell him  you shouldn t
have told me  but you did 
and now  i m telling you 
you don t wanna know 
the redhead s got a gun 
holy   
fire 
fire 
i m gonna kill him 
thatch  go back to bed 
get some water on that fire 
no time 
get us into those caves 
move it  move it  move it 
gertie  pull 
milo  jump  right now 
no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
all right  who s not dead  sound off 
danged lightning bugs
done bit me on my sit upon 
somebody s gonna have to
suck out that poison 
now  don t everybody jump up at once 
audrey  give me a damage report 
not as bad as it could have been 
we totaled rigs two and seven 
but the digger looks like it ll still run 
lucky for us
we landed in something soft 
pumice ash 
we are standing at the base
of a dormant volcano 
it just keeps going 
maybe that s our ticket outta here 
maybe not 
the magma has solidified
in the bowels of the volcano 
effectively blocking the exit 
i got the same problem with sauerkraut 
hold on  back up 
are you saying this whole volcano
can blow at any time 
no  no  no  no 
that would take
an explosive force of great magnitude 
maybe i should do this later 
if we could blow the top off of that thing 
we d have a straight shot to the surface 
mr  thatch  what do you think 
mr  thatch 
thatch 
hey  wait 
who are you  where are you going 
come back 
hey  wait a minute 
who are you 
sweet mother of jefferson davis 
it s beautiful 
milo  i gotta hand it to you 
you really came through 
i take that back 
holy cats  who are these guys 
  they gotta be atlanteans 
  what  that s impossible 
i seen this back in the dakota 
they can smell fear
just by looking at ya 
so  keep quiet 
i think it s talking to you 
parlez vous français 
oui  monsieur 
they speak my language 
pardon  mademoiselle 
voulez vous   
i like her 
 bout time someone hit him 
i m just sorry it wasn t me 
how do they know all these languages 
their language must be
based on a root dialect 
it s just like the tower of babel 
well  maybe english
is in there somewhere 
we are explorers
from the surface world 
we come in peace 
welcome to the city of atlantis 
come  you must speak
with my father now 
squad  b   head back
to the shaft and salvage what you can 
  yes  sir 
  we ll rendezvous in 24 hours 
let s move it  you heard him 
i m so excited 
now  what s really amazing is that
if you deconstructed latin 
you overlaid it
with a little sumerian 
throw in a dash of thessalonian 
you d be getting close to
their basic grammatical structure 
or at least you d be
in the same ballpark   
  someone s having a good time 
  like a kid at christmas 
commander  there were
not supposed to be people down here 
this changes everything 
this changes nothing 
take that  mr  harcourt 
your majesty 
on behalf of my crew 
may i say it is an honor
to be welcomed to your city 
excuse me  commander 
you presume much
to think you are welcome here 
oh  sir  we have come
a long way looking for   
i know what you seek 
and you will not find it here 
your journey has been in vain 
but we are peaceful explorers 
men of science 
and yet you bring weapons 
our weapons allow us to remove
obstacles we may encounter 
some obstacles cannot be
removed with a mere show of force 
return to your people 
you must leave atlantis at once 
oh  your majesty  be reasonable 
  sir   
  not now  son 
trust me on this 
we better do as he says 
may i respectfully request
that we stay one night  sir 
that would give us
time to rest  resupply 
and be ready to travel by morning 
very well  one night 
that is all 
well  thank you  your majesty 
your heart has softened  kida 
a thousand years ago 
you would have slain them on sight 
a thousand years ago 
the streets were lit 
and our people did not
have to scavenge for food
at the edge of a crumbling city 
the people are content 
they do not know any better 
we were once a great people 
now we live in ruins 
the kings of our past would weep
if they could see how far we have fallen 
  kida 
  if these outsiders
can unlock the secrets of our past 
perhaps we can save our future 
what they have to teach us
we have already learned 
our way of life is dying 
our way of life is preserved 
kida  when you take the throne 
you will understand 
  so  how d it go 
  well 
the king and his daughter
don t exactly see eye to eye 
she seems to like us okay 
but the king   
i don t know  i think
he s hiding something 
well  if he s hiding something 
i want to know what it is 
  someone needs to talk to that girl 
  i will go 
  someone with good people skills 
  i will do it 
  someone who won t scare her away 
  i volunteer 
someone who can speak the language 
for the good of the mission  i will go 
good man  thatch 
thanks for volunteering 
go get  em  tiger 
okay  milo  don t take no for an answer 
 look  i have some questions for you 
 and i m not leaving this city
until they re answered   yeah  that s it 
that s good  that s good 
i have some questions for you 
and you are not leaving this city
until they are answered 
  yeah  well  i    okay 
  come with me 
oh  there is so much
to ask about your world 
you are a scholar  are you not 
judging from your diminished
physique and large forehead 
you are suited for nothing else 
what is your country of origin 
when did the flood waters recede 
  how did you   
  wait a minute 
i got a few questions for you  too 
so let s do this  okay 
you ask one  then i ll ask one 
then you  then me  then   
well  you get it 
very well  what is your first question 
well  okay  how did you get here 
well  i mean  not you  personally 
but your culture 
i mean  how did all of this
end up down here 
it is said that
the gods became jealous of atlantis 
they sent a great cataclysm
and banished us here 
all i can remember is the sky going dark
and people shouting and running 
then  a bright light  like a star
floating above the city 
my father said it called my mother to it 
i never saw her again 
i m sorry  if it s any consolation 
i know how you feel  because i lost my   
wait a minute  wait a minute 
back up 
what are you telling me 
that you remember
because you were there 
no  that s    that s impossible   
because  i mean 
that would make you   
you know  8 500 8 800 years old 
yes 
oh  well  hey  looking good 
just   
  you got another question for me 
  yes 
how is it you found
your way to this place 
well  i ll tell you  it wasn t easy 
if it weren t for this book 
we never would have made it 
okay  second question  legend has it
that your people possessed
a power source of some kind
that enabled them   
  you mean you can understand this 
  yes  i m a linguist 
that s what i do  that s my job 
  now  getting back to my question   
  this  right here 
you can read this 
yes  yes 
i can read atlantean  just like you 
you can t  can you 
no one can 
such knowledge has been lost to us
since the time of the mehbehlmoak 
oh  the great flood 
  show me 
  okay   
 follow the narrow passage
for another league  
 there  you will find the fifth marker  
yeah  yeah  that s it 
how was my accent 
boorish  provincial   
  and you speak it through your nose 
  yeah  gotta work on that 
here  let me show you something 
what  it looks like some sort of vehicle 
yes  but no matter what i try 
it will not respond 
  perhaps if   
  way ahead of you 
okay  let s see what we got here 
okay   place crystal into slot  
yes  yes  i have done that 
 gently place your hand
on the inscription pad  
  yes 
  okay  did you turn the crystal
  one quarter turn back 
  yes  yes 
while your hand was
on the inscription pad 
no 
well  see  there s
your problem right there 
that s an easy thing to miss 
you know  you deserve credit
for even getting this far 
okay  give it a try 
yeah  you got that right 
this is great  with this thing 
i could see the whole city
in no time at all 
wonder how fast it goes 
so  who s hungry 
by the way  we were never
properly introduced 
my name s milo 
my name is kidagakash 
kidamaschnaga 
hey  you got a nickname 
kida 
okay  kida  i can remember that 
what is wrong 
oh  it s nothing  i just   
got something in my eye 
you know  my grandpa
used to tell me stories
about this place
as far back as i can remember 
i just wish he could be
standing here with me 
tell me more about your companions 
your physician  he is called cookie 
  no  that s sweet 
  what is 
the doctor  he s sweet 
oh  he is kindly 
no  no  no  that s    that s his name 
  his name is kindly 
  no  sweet 
well  i mean  he s kindly  too 
so all of your doctors
are sweet and kindly 
no  well  i m sure some are 
ours is  but that s not a requirement 
  you re missing the point 
  you are confusing me 
look at all those tattoos 
shoot  that ain t nothing 
look here what i got 
all 38 united states 
watch me make rhode island dance 
go on  baby  dance  dance 
there you go 
cookies are sweet  but yours is not 
sweet is kindly 
but that is not his name 
audrey is sweet 
but she is not your doctor 
and the little digging animal
called mole   
he is your pet 
close enough 
oh  don t forget to eat the head 
that s where all the nutrients are 
you know  kida 
the most we ever hoped to find
was some crumbling buildings 
maybe some broken pottery 
instead  we find a living 
thriving society 
these guys are kinda cute
when they re not  you know 
formed into a fiery column of death 
we are not thriving 
true  our people live 
but our culture is dying 
we are like a stone
the ocean beats against 
with each passing year 
a little more of us is worn away 
i wish there was something i could do 
i have brought you to this place
to ask you for your help 
there is a mural here
with writing all around the pictures 
yeah  well  you came to the right guy 
okay  let me see 
let s start with this column right here 
well  this    kida 
  what are you doing 
  you do swim  do you not 
oh  i swim  pretty girl 
pretty good  pretty good 
good  swim good 
pretty good  i swim pretty good 
good  it is a fair distance
to where we are going 
hey  you are talking
to the belly flop champ
at camp runamuck 
come on  we re wasting time 
why don t you lead the way  because
i have no idea where we re going 
  are you all right 
  well  i didn t drown  so   
good  follow me 
this is amazing 
a complete history of atlantis 
it s just like plato described it 
well  he was off on a few details  but   
the light i saw 
the star in the middle of the city 
what does the writing say about that 
i don t know yet 
but we re gonna find out 
come on 
  the heart of atlantis 
  what 
it s the heart of atlantis  that s
what the shepherd was talking about 
it wasn t a star  it was   
it was some kind of crystal 
like these  don t you get it 
the power source i ve been looking for 
the bright light you remember 
  they re the same thing 
  that cannot be 
it s what s keeping all these things   
you  all of atlantis alive 
then where is it now 
i don t know  i don t know 
you d think something
this important
would have been in the journal  but   
unless    the missing page 
you have a nice swim 
hey  guys  what s going on 
what s    what s with all the guns 
guys 
i am such an idiot 
this is just another
treasure hunt for you 
  you re after the crystal 
  oh  you mean this 
the heart of atlantis 
yeah  about that 
i would ve told you sooner 
but it was strictly
on a need to know basis 
and  well  now you know 
i had to be sure you were one of us 
welcome to the club  son 
i m no mercenary 
mercenary 
i prefer the term  adventure capitalist  
besides  you re the one
who got us here 
you led us right to the treasure chest 
you don t know what
you re tampering with  rourke 
what s to know  it s big  it s shiny 
it s going to make us all rich 
you think it s some kind of a diamond 
i thought it was some kind of a battery 
but we re both wrong 
it s their life force 
that crystal is the only thing
keeping these people alive 
you take that away  and they ll die 
well  that changes things 
  helga  what do you think 
  knowing that  i d double the price 
i was thinking triple 
rourke  don t do this 
academics  you never want
to get your hands dirty 
think about it 
if you gave back
every stolen artifact from a museum 
you d be left with an empty building 
we re just providing
a necessary service
to the archeological community 
not interested 
i got to admit  i m disappointed 
you re an idealist 
just like your grandfather 
do yourself a favor  milo 
don t be like him 
for once  do the smart thing 
i really hate it
when negotiations go sour 
let s try this again 
  knock  knock 
  room service 
tell them to drop their weapons    now 
spread out  search everywhere 
you re not applying yourself  son 
there s got to be something else 
well  there isn t  it just says 
 the heart of atlantis lies
in the eyes of her king  
well  then maybe old king cole here
can help us fill in the blanks 
how about it  chief 
where s the crystal chamber 
you will destroy yourselves 
maybe i m not being clear 
rourke  this was not a part of the plan 
plan s changed  doc 
i d suggest you put a bandage
on that bleeding heart of yours 
it doesn t suit a mercenary 
well  as usual  diplomacy has failed us 
now  i m going to count to 10 
and you re going to tell me
where the crystal is 
one   
two   
nine   
t   
the heart of atlantis
lies in the eyes of her king 
this is it  we re in 
rourke  for the last time 
you ve got to listen to me 
you don t have the slightest idea
what this power is capable of 
true  but i can think of a few countries
who d pay anything to find out 
hurry  get on 
jackpot 
the kings of our past 
thatch  tell her to wrap it up 
we got a schedule to meet 
kida   
i m sorry 
come on  let s get this over with 
i don t like this place 
all right  thatch  what s next 
okay  there s a giant crystal
hovering 150 feet above our heads
over a bottomless pit of water 
doesn t anything surprise you 
the only thing that surprises me
is you re still
talking and
that thing s not on the truck yet 
  now move it 
  i don t know how to move it 
i don t even know
what s holding it up there 
talk to me  thatch  what s happening 
look  all it says here
is that the crystal is alive  somehow 
i don t know how to explain it 
it s their deity  it s their power source 
speak english  professor 
they re a part of it  it s a part of them 
i m doing the best i can here 
  well  do better 
  oh  i know 
why don t you translate 
and i ll wave the gun around 
what did she say 
i don t know  i didn t catch it 
hold your horses  lover boy 
kida 
no  don t  don t touch her 
all right  step back 
sergeant  keep those people back 
you heard him  step back 
i m warning you 
so   
i guess this is how it ends 
fine  you win 
you re wiping out an entire civilization 
but hey    you ll be rich 
congratulations  audrey 
guess you and your dad will be able
to open up that second garage after all 
and  vinny  you can start
a whole chain of flower shops 
i m sure your family s
going to be very proud 
but that s what it s all about  right 
  money 
  get off your soapbox  thatch 
you ve read darwin 
it s called natural selection 
we re just helping it along 
  commander  we re ready 
  yeah  give me a minute 
i know i m forgetting something 
i got the cargo  the crystal  the crew   
oh  yeah 
look at it this way  son 
you were the man
who discovered atlantis 
and now  you re part of the exhibit 
let s move  people 
that was an order 
not a suggestion  let s go 
we re all going to die 
oh  you can t be serious 
this is wrong  and you know it 
we re this close
to our biggest payday ever 
and you pick now of all times
to grow a conscience 
we ve done a lot of things
we re not proud of 
robbing graves  plundering tombs 
double parking  but nobody got hurt 
well  maybe somebody got hurt 
but nobody we knew 
well  if that s the way you want it  fine 
more for me 
p t  barnum was right 
  we can t let him do this 
  wait a second 
okay  now you can go 
milo  you better get up here 
how s he doing 
not good  i m afraid 
internal bleeding 
there s nothing more i can do 
what a nightmare 
  and i brought it here 
  don t go beating yourself up 
he s been after that crystal
since iceland 
the crystal  sweet  that s it 
these    these crystals 
they have some sort of healing energy 
i ve seen it work 
no 
where is my daughter 
well  she   
she has been chosen 
like her mother before her 
what 
in times of danger 
the crystal will choose a host 
one of royal blood  to protect itself
and its people 
it will accept no other 
wait a minute  choose 
so this thing is alive 
in a way 
the crystal thrives
on the collective emotions
of all who came before us 
in return  it provides power 
longevity  protection 
as it grew 
it developed
a consciousness of its own 
in my arrogance 
i sought to use it as a weapon of war 
but it s power proved
too great to control 
it overwhelmed us
and led to our destruction 
that s why you hid it beneath the city 
to keep history from repeating itself 
and to prevent kida from suffering
the same fate as my beloved wife 
what do you mean 
what s going to happen to kida 
if she remains bonded to the crystal 
she could be lost to it forever 
the love of my daughter
is all i have left 
my burden would have become hers
when the time was right 
but now  it falls to you 
me 
return the crystal 
save atlantis 
save my daughter 
so  what s it going to be 
  excuse me 
  i followed you in  and i ll follow you out 
  it s your decision 
  oh  my decision 
well  i think we ve seen
how effective my decisions have been 
let s recap 
i lead a band of plundering vandals
to the greatest archeological find
in recorded history 
thus enabling the kidnap
and or murder of the royal family 
not to mention personally delivering
the most powerful force known to man
into the hands of a mercenary nutcase
who s probably going
to sell it to the kaiser 
have i left anything out 
well  you did set the camp on fire
  and drop us down that big hole 
  thank you 
thank you very much 
of course  it s been my experience
when you hit bottom 
the only place left to go is up 
who told you that 
a fella by the name
of thaddeus thatch 
where are you going 
  i m going after rourke 
  milo  that s crazy 
i didn t say it was the smart thing 
but it is the right thing 
come on  we better make sure
he doesn t hurt himself 
milo  what do you think you are doing 
just follow my lead 
i m impressed 
it s simple  all you got to do   
yeah  yeah  yeah 
shut up  we get it  okay 
no  no  wait 
gently  just gently 
hey  milo  you got something sporty 
you know  like a tuna 
  how is this done 
  all you got to do is use the crystals 
kida showed me 
half turn right  quarter turn back 
keep your hand on the pad 
saddle up  partners 
bring jerky and ammo 
i m so excited 
all right  this is it 
we re going to rescue the princess 
we re going to save atlantis 
or we re going to die trying 
now let s do it 
i love it when i win 
okay  here s the plan 
we re going to come in low and fast
and take them by surprise 
well  i ve got news for you  milo 
rourke is never surprised 
and he s got a lot of guns 
great  well  do you have
any suggestions 
yeah  don t get shot 
there they are 
we ve got company 
take off 
take her up 
holy smokes 
you told me he only had guns 
what i said was  he s never surprised 
okay  now things are getting good 
vinny  heads up 
we can t let them reach
the top of that shaft 
vinny  new plan 
you and me  we re going to be decoys 
audrey  sweet  fly up underneath
that thing and cut her loose 
we re on it 
lieutenant 
i thought you said this thing could
cut through a femur in 28 seconds 
less talk  more saw 
looks like somebody s
working overtime 
come on  girl  time s up 
all right  milo  this is it 
any last words 
yeah  i really wish i had
a better idea than this 
we re losing altitude 
lighten the load 
that s it 
unless someone wants to jump 
ladies first 
you said we were in this together 
you promised me a percentage 
next time  get it in writing 
nothing personal 
well  i have to hand it to you 
you re a bigger pain in the neck
than i would have
ever thought possible 
i consider myself
an even tempered man 
it takes a lot to get under my skin 
but congratulations 
you just won the solid gold kewpie doll 
nothing personal 
tired  mr  thatch 
that s a darn shame
because i m just getting warmed up 
thank heaven 
oh  great 
the volcano    she awakes 
hey  i had nothing to do with it 
this here would be
a good place not to be 
no  wait  we got to get her back
or the whole city will die 
and if we don t get out of here  we ll die 
it s the only way to reverse this 
just do it 
milo  no 
go 
the fissure 
it is about to eject its pyroclastic fury 
milo  mole says the wall s going to blow 
milo 
atlantis will honor your names forever 
i only wish there was more
we could do for you

we are really going to miss you  milo
