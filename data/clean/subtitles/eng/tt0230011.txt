now weve all heard
of the legend of atlantis
a continent somewhere
in the midatlantic
that was home
to an advanced civilization
possessing technology
far beyond our own
that according to our friend plato here
was suddenly struck
by some cataclysmic event
that sank it beneath the sea
now some of you may ask
why atlantis
its just a myth isnt it
pure fantasy
well that is where youd be wrong
10000 years
before the egyptians built the pyramids
atlantis had electricity
advanced medicine
even the power of flight
impossible you say
well no no not for them
numerous ancient cultures
all over the globe agree
that atlantis possessed
a power source of some kind
more powerful than steam than coal
more powerful than our modern
internal combustion engines
gentlemen i propose
that we find atlantis
find that power source
and bring it back to the surface
now this is a page
from an illuminated text
that describes a book called
the shepherds journal
said to have been
a firsthand account of atlantis
and its exact whereabouts
now based on a centuriesold
translation of a norse text
historians have believed
the journal resides in ireland
but after comparing the text
to the runes on this viking shield
i found that one of the letters
had been mistranslated
so by changing this letter
and inserting the correct one
we find that the shepherds journal
the key to atlantis
lies not in ireland gentlemen
but in iceland
pause for effect
gentlemen ill take your questions now
would you gentlemen
please excuse me for a moment
cartography and linguistics
milo thatch speaking
yeah just a second
pardon me mr hickenbottom
hows that is that better
yeah youre welcome
and dont let it happen again

that ive drawn i plotted the route
that will take myself and a crew
to the southern coast of iceland
to retrieve the journal
showtime
well this is it
i am finally getting out of the dungeon

a lot of attention
boiler

if you reject my proposal ill
ill quit
i mean it sir
if you refuse to fund my proposal
youll what
flush your career down the toilet
just like your grandfather
you have a lot of potential milo
dont throw it all away
chasing fairy tales
but i can prove atlantis exists
you want to go on an expedition
here take a trolley
to the potomac and jump in
maybe the cold water will
clear your head heinz
im home
fluffy here kitty
milo james thatch
who who are you
how did you get in here
i came down the chimney
my name is helga sinclair
im acting on behalf of my employer
who has a most intriguing
proposition for you
are you interested
your employer
who is your employer
this way please
and dont drip on the caravaggio
step lively
mr whitmore does not like
to be kept waiting
you will address him
as mr whitmore or sir
you will stand unless
asked to be seated
keep your sentences short
and to the point
are we clear
and relax
he doesnt bite often
grandpa
finest explorer i ever met
preston whitmore
pleasure to meet you milo
join me in a little yoga
no no thank you
did you really know my grandfather
oh yeah met old thaddeus
back in georgetown
class of 66 we stayed close friends
till the end of his days
even dragged me along
on some of his danged fool expeditions
thatch was crazy as a fruit bat he was
he spoke of you often
funny he never mentioned you
he wouldnt
he knew how much i like my privacy
i keep a low profile
mr whitmore should i be
wondering why im here
look on that table
its for you
its from my grandfather
he brought that package
to me years ago
he said if anything
were to happen to him
i should give it to you
when you were ready
whatever that means
it
it cant be
its the shepherds journal
mr whitmore this journal is the key
to finding the lost continent of atlantis
atlantis
i wasnt born yesterday son
no no no look look at this
coordinates clues its all right here
yeah looks like gibberish to me
thats because its been written
in a dialect that no longer exists
so its useless
no no just difficult
ive spent my whole life
studying dead languages
its not gibberish to me
its probably a fake
mr whitmore
my grandfather would have known
if this were a fake i would know
i will stake everything i own
everything that i believe in
that this is
the genuine shepherds journal
all right all right
so what do you want to do with it
well ill get funding
i mean ill the museum
theyll never believe you
ill show them i will make them believe
like you did today
yes well no how did you
forget about them okay never mind
i will find atlantis on my own
i mean if i have to rent a rowboat
congratulations milo
this is exactly what i wanted to hear
but forget the rowboat son
well travel in style
its all been arranged
the whole ball of wax
why
for years your granddad bent my ear
with stories about that old book
i didnt buy it for a minute
so finally i got fed up
and i made a bet with the old coot
i said thatch if you ever
actually find that socalled journal
not only will i finance the expedition
but ill kiss you full on the mouth
imagine my embarrassment
when he found the darn thing
now i know
your grandfathers gone milo
god rest his soul
but preston whitmore
is a man who keeps his word
you hear that thatch
im going to the afterlife
with a clear conscience by thunder
your grandpa was a great man
you probably dont realize how great
those buffoons at the museum
dragged him down
made a laughing stock of him
he died a broken man
if i could bring back
just one shred of proof
thatd be enough for me
thatch
what are we standing around for
we got work to do
but mr whitmore
you know in order to do
what youre proposing
youre gonna need a crew
taken care of
youll need engineers and geologists
got em all the best of the best
gaetan moliere
geology and excavation
the man has a nose for dirt
vincenzo santorini demolitions
busted him out of a turkish prison
audrey ramirez
dont let her age fool you
shes forgotten more about engines
than you and i will ever know
theyre the same crew that
brought the journal back
where was it
iceland
i knew it i knew it
all we need now is
an expert in gibberish
so its decision time
you can build on
the foundation your grandfather left you
or you can go back to your boiler room

good afternoon

a depiction of a creature
a creature so frightening
that sailors were said
to be driven mad by the mere sight of it
im sorry thats wrong
geez i used to take lunch money
from guys like this
anyway this okay
this is an illustration of the leviathan
the creature guarding
the entrance to atlantis
with something like that
i would have white wine i think
its a mythical sea serpent
hes described in the book of job
the bible says
out of his mouth go burning lights
sparks of fire shoot out
but more likely its a carving or
a sculpture to frighten the superstitious
so we find this masterpiece
then what
when do we dig
actually we dont have to dig
you see according to the journal
the path to atlantis
will take us down a tunnel
at the bottom of the ocean
and well come up a curve
into an air pocket right here
where well find the remnants
of an ancient highway
that will lead us to atlantis
kind of like the grease trap in your sink
cartographer linguist plumber
hard to believe hes still single

seven hours ago
we started this expedition
with 200 of the finest men and women
ive ever known
were all thats left
i wont sugarcoat it gentlemen
we have a crisis on our hands
but weve been up
this particular creek before
and weve always come through
paddle or no paddle
i see no reason
to change that policy now
from here on in
everyone pulls double duty
everyone drives everyone works
looks like all our chances for survival
rest with you mr thatch
you and that little book
were all gonna die
okay people saddle up
lieutenant i want this convoy
moving five minutes ago
moliere youre on point
no vinny audreys taking the oiler
you know the rules i want you 50 yards
behind that truck at all times
and packard put out that cigarette
are you sure youre checked out
on this class of vehicle
can you drive a truck
of course i can drive a truck
i mean sure you got your steering
and your gas and your brake
and of course this metallooking thing
okay so it was a bumper car
at coney island
but its the same basic principle
come on move it
sorry about sorry about that
come on civilian
you didnt just drink that did you
thats not good
thats nitroglycerin
dont move
dont breathe
dont do anything except pray maybe
boom
yeah
good night
will you look at the size of this
its gotta be half a mile high at least
it must have taken hundred
no thousands of years
to carve this thing
hey look i made a bridge
it only took me like what
10 seconds 11 tops
looks like we have a little roadblock
vinny what do you think
i could unroadblock that
if i had about 200 of these
problem is i only got about 10
plus you know five of my own
and a couple of cherry bombs
a road flare
hey too bad we dont have
some nitroglycerin milo
looks like were gonna have to dig
it will be my pleasure
stupid
stupid
i dont understand it
i just tuned this thing up this morning
it looks like the rotors shot
im gonna have to pull
a spare from one of the trucks
can i
no toques nada
ill be right back
she lives
hey whatd you do
well you know the boiler in this baby
is a humac model p54 stroke 813
now we got the 814
back at the museum
the heating cores
on the whole humac line
have always been a little
you know temperamental
so sometimes you gotta boom
persuade em a little
yeah yeah thank you very much
shut up
two for flinching
this is it its gotta be
all right well make camp here
why is it glowing
it is a natural phosphorescence
that thing is going to
keep me up all night i know it
come and get it
for the appetizer caesar salad
escargot and your oriental spring rolls
yuck
i wanted the escargot
knock yourself out
there you go milo
put some meat on them bones
thanks cookie
that looks greasier than usual
you like it well have some more
youre so skinny
if you turned sideways
and stuck out your tongue
youd look like a zipper
you know
weve been pretty tough on the kid
what do you say
we cut him some slack
yeah youre right
hey milo
why dont you come sit with us
really you dont mind
nah park it here
gee this is great
i mean you know
its an honor to be included in your
mole
forgive me
i could not resist
hey milo
dont you ever close that book
yeah you mustve read it
a dozen times by now
i know but this
this doesnt make any sense
see in this passage here the shepherd
seems to be leading up to something
he calls it the heart of atlantis
it could be the power source
the legends refer to
but then it just it cuts off
its almost like theres a missing page
kid relax
we dont get paid overtime
i know i know
sometimes i get a little carried away
but hey you know
thats what this is all about right
i mean discovery
teamwork adventure
unless maybe
youre just in it for the money
money
money
im gonna say money
well i guess
i set myself up for that one
what is something
wrong with your neck
oh yeah i mustve hurt it when
better
yeah
hey howd you learn how to do that
an arapaho medicine man
get outta here
born and raised with em
my father was an army medic
he settled down in the kansas
territory after he met my mother
no kidding
nope
i got a sheepskin from howard u
and a bearskin from old iron cloud
halfway through medical school
i was drafted
one day im studying gross anatomy
in the classroom
the next im sewing up rough riders
on san juan hill
main course
i couldnt eat another bite
im watching my weight
dont you worry
itll keep and keep and keep
thank god i lost my sense of taste
years ago
arent you going to pitch up your tent
i did
i guess im still a little rusty at this
i havent gone camping since
well since the last time
my grandpa took me
i never got to meet your grandfather
what was he like
where do you start
he was like a father to me really
my parents died when i was
a little kid and he took me in
what
well i was just thinking
one time when i was eight
we were hiking along this stream
and i saw something
shining in the water
it was a genuine arrowhead
well youd think id found
a lost civilization
the way grandpa carried on about it
it wasnt until i was older
that i realized that the arrowhead
was just some compressed shale
mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured
into an isosceletic triangulate
that is so cute
say audrey no offense
but how does a teenager
become the chief mechanic
of a multimillion dollar expedition
well i took this job
when my dad retired
but the funny thing was
he always wanted sons right
one to run his machine shop
and the other
to be middleweight boxing champion
but he got my sister and me instead
so what happened to your sister
shes 240 with a shot
at the title next month
anyway im saving up
so my papi and i
can open another shop
forget your jammies mrs packard
i sleep in the nude
youre gonna want a pair of these
she sleepwalks
well as far as me goes
i just like to blow things up
come on vinny tell the kid the truth
my family owned a flower shop
we would sell roses
carnations babys breath you name it
one day im making
about three dozen corsages
for this prom
you know the one
they put on their wrist
and everybody they come
where is it
when is it
does it match my dress
its a nightmare
anyway i guess
there was this leak next door
of gas or what boom
no more chinese laundry
blew me right through the front window
it was like a sign from god
i found myself that boom
whats moles story
trust me on this one
you dont wanna know
audrey dont tell him you shouldnt
have told me but you did
and now im telling you
you dont wanna know
the redheads got a gun
holy
fire
fire
im gonna kill him
thatch go back to bed
get some water on that fire
no time
get us into those caves
move it move it move it
gertie pull
milo jump right now
no no no no no no no
all right whos not dead sound off
danged lightning bugs
done bit me on my sit upon
somebodys gonna have to
suck out that poison
now dont everybody jump up at once
audrey give me a damage report
not as bad as it could have been
we totaled rigs two and seven
but the digger looks like itll still run
lucky for us
we landed in something soft
pumice ash
we are standing at the base
of a dormant volcano
it just keeps going
maybe thats our ticket outta here
maybe not
the magma has solidified
in the bowels of the volcano
effectively blocking the exit
i got the same problem with sauerkraut
hold on back up
are you saying this whole volcano
can blow at any time
no no no no
that would take
an explosive force of great magnitude
maybe i should do this later
if we could blow the top off of that thing
wed have a straight shot to the surface
mr thatch what do you think
mr thatch
thatch
hey wait
who are you where are you going
come back
hey wait a minute
who are you
sweet mother of jefferson davis
its beautiful
milo i gotta hand it to you
you really came through
i take that back
holy cats who are these guys
they gotta be atlanteans
what thats impossible
i seen this back in the dakota
they can smell fear
just by looking at ya
so keep quiet
i think its talking to you
parlezvous français
oui monsieur
they speak my language
pardon mademoiselle
voulezvous
i like her
bout time someone hit him
im just sorry it wasnt me
how do they know all these languages
their language must be
based on a root dialect
its just like the tower of babel
well maybe english
is in there somewhere
we are explorers
from the surface world
we come in peace
welcome to the city of atlantis
come you must speak
with my father now
squad b head back
to the shaft and salvage what you can
yes sir
well rendezvous in 24 hours
lets move it you heard him
im so excited
now whats really amazing is that
if you deconstructed latin
you overlaid it
with a little sumerian
throw in a dash of thessalonian
youd be getting close to
their basic grammatical structure
or at least youd be
in the same ballpark
someones having a good time
like a kid at christmas
commander there were
not supposed to be people down here
this changes everything
this changes nothing
take that mr harcourt
your majesty
on behalf of my crew
may i say it is an honor
to be welcomed to your city
excuse me commander
you presume much
to think you are welcome here
oh sir we have come
a long way looking for
i know what you seek
and you will not find it here
your journey has been in vain
but we are peaceful explorers
men of science
and yet you bring weapons
our weapons allow us to remove
obstacles we may encounter
some obstacles cannot be
removed with a mere show of force
return to your people
you must leave atlantis at once
oh your majesty be reasonable
sir
not now son
trust me on this
we better do as he says
may i respectfully request
that we stay one night sir
that would give us
time to rest resupply
and be ready to travel by morning
very well one night
that is all
well thank you your majesty
your heart has softened kida
a thousand years ago
you would have slain them on sight
a thousand years ago
the streets were lit
and our people did not
have to scavenge for food
at the edge of a crumbling city
the people are content
they do not know any better
we were once a great people
now we live in ruins
the kings of our past would weep
if they could see how far we have fallen
kida
if these outsiders
can unlock the secrets of our past
perhaps we can save our future
what they have to teach us
we have already learned
our way of life is dying
our way of life is preserved
kida when you take the throne
you will understand
so howd it go
well
the king and his daughter
dont exactly see eye to eye
she seems to like us okay
but the king
i dont know i think
hes hiding something
well if hes hiding something
i want to know what it is
someone needs to talk to that girl
i will go
someone with good people skills
i will do it
someone who wont scare her away
i volunteer
someone who can speak the language
for the good of the mission i will go
good man thatch
thanks for volunteering
go get em tiger
okay milo dont take no for an answer
look i have some questions for you
and im not leaving this city
until theyre answered yeah thats it
thats good thats good
i have some questions for you
and you are not leaving this city
until they are answered
yeah well i okay
come with me
oh there is so much
to ask about your world
you are a scholar are you not
judging from your diminished
physique and large forehead
you are suited for nothing else
what is your country of origin
when did the flood waters recede
how did you
wait a minute
i got a few questions for you too
so lets do this okay
you ask one then ill ask one
then you then me then
well you get it
very well what is your first question
well okay how did you get here
well i mean not you personally
but your culture
i mean how did all of this
end up down here
it is said that
the gods became jealous of atlantis
they sent a great cataclysm
and banished us here
all i can remember is the sky going dark
and people shouting and running
then a bright light like a star
floating above the city
my father said it called my mother to it
i never saw her again
im sorry if its any consolation
i know how you feel because i lost my
wait a minute wait a minute
back up
what are you telling me
that you remember
because you were there
no thats thats impossible
because i mean
that would make you
you know 85008800 years old
yes
oh well hey looking good
just
you got another question for me
yes
how is it you found
your way to this place
well ill tell you it wasnt easy
if it werent for this book
we never would have made it
okay second question legend has it
that your people possessed
a power source of some kind
that enabled them
you mean you can understand this
yes im a linguist
thats what i do thats my job
now getting back to my question
this right here
you can read this
yes yes
i can read atlantean just like you
you cant can you
no one can
such knowledge has been lost to us
since the time of the mehbehlmoak
oh the great flood
show me
okay
follow the narrow passage
for another league
there you will find the fifth marker
yeah yeah thats it
how was my accent
boorish provincial
and you speak it through your nose
yeah gotta work on that
here let me show you something
what it looks like some sort of vehicle
yes but no matter what i try
it will not respond
perhaps if
way ahead of you
okay lets see what we got here
okay place crystal into slot
yes yes i have done that
gently place your hand
on the inscription pad
yes
okay did you turn the crystal
onequarter turn back
yes yes

well see theres
your problem right there
thats an easy thing to miss
you know you deserve credit
for even getting this far
okay give it a try
yeah you got that right
this is great with this thing
i could see the whole city
in no time at all
wonder how fast it goes
so whos hungry
by the way we were never
properly introduced
my names milo
my name is kidagakash
kidamaschnaga
hey you got a nickname
kida
okay kida i can remember that
what is wrong
oh its nothing i just
got something in my eye
you know my grandpa
used to tell me stories
about this place
as far back as i can remember
i just wish he could be
standing here with me
tell me more about your companions
your physician he is called cookie
no thats sweet
what is
the doctor hes sweet
oh he is kindly
no no no thats thats his name
his name is kindly
no sweet
well i mean hes kindly too
so all of your doctors
are sweet and kindly
no well im sure some are
ours is but thats not a requirement
youre missing the point
you are confusing me
look at all those tattoos
shoot that aint nothing
look here what i got
all 38 united states
watch me make rhode island dance
go on baby dance dance
there you go
cookies are sweet but yours is not
sweet is kindly
but that is not his name
audrey is sweet
but she is not your doctor
and the little digging animal
called mole
he is your pet
close enough
oh dont forget to eat the head
thats where all the nutrients are
you know kida
the most we ever hoped to find
was some crumbling buildings
maybe some broken pottery
instead we find a living
thriving society
these guys are kinda cute
when theyre not you know
formed into a fiery column of death
we are not thriving
true our people live
but our culture is dying
we are like a stone
the ocean beats against
with each passing year
a little more of us is worn away
i wish there was something i could do
i have brought you to this place
to ask you for your help
there is a mural here
with writing all around the pictures
yeah well you came to the right guy
okay let me see
lets start with this column right here
well this kida
what are you doing
you do swim do you not
oh i swim pretty girl
pretty good pretty good
good swim good
pretty good i swim pretty good
good it is a fair distance
to where we are going
hey you are talking
to the belly flop champ
at camp runamuck
come on were wasting time
why dont you lead the way because
i have no idea where were going
are you all right
well i didnt drown so
good follow me
this is amazing
a complete history of atlantis
its just like plato described it
well he was off on a few details but
the light i saw
the star in the middle of the city
what does the writing say about that
i dont know yet
but were gonna find out
come on
the heart of atlantis
what
its the heart of atlantis thats
what the shepherd was talking about
it wasnt a star it was
it was some kind of crystal
like these dont you get it
the power source ive been looking for
the bright light you remember
theyre the same thing
that cannot be
its whats keeping all these things
you all of atlantis alive
then where is it now
i dont know i dont know
youd think something
this important
would have been in the journal but
unless the missing page
you have a nice swim
hey guys whats going on
whats whats with all the guns
guys
i am such an idiot
this is just another
treasure hunt for you
youre after the crystal
oh you mean this
the heart of atlantis
yeah about that
i wouldve told you sooner
but it was strictly
on a needtoknow basis
and well now you know
i had to be sure you were one of us
welcome to the club son
im no mercenary
mercenary
i prefer the term adventure capitalist
besides youre the one
who got us here
you led us right to the treasure chest
you dont know what
youre tampering with rourke
whats to know its big its shiny
its going to make us all rich
you think its some kind of a diamond
i thought it was some kind of a battery
but were both wrong
its their life force
that crystal is the only thing
keeping these people alive
you take that away and theyll die
well that changes things
helga what do you think
knowing that id double the price
i was thinking triple
rourke dont do this
academics you never want
to get your hands dirty
think about it
if you gave back
every stolen artifact from a museum
youd be left with an empty building
were just providing
a necessary service
to the archeological community
not interested
i got to admit im disappointed
youre an idealist
just like your grandfather
do yourself a favor milo
dont be like him
for once do the smart thing
i really hate it
when negotiations go sour
lets try this again
knock knock
room service
tell them to drop their weapons now
spread out search everywhere
youre not applying yourself son
theres got to be something else
well there isnt it just says
the heart of atlantis lies
in the eyes of her king
well then maybe old king cole here
can help us fill in the blanks
how about it chief
wheres the crystal chamber
you will destroy yourselves
maybe im not being clear
rourke this was not a part of the plan
plans changed doc
id suggest you put a bandage
on that bleeding heart of yours
it doesnt suit a mercenary
well as usual diplomacy has failed us
now im going to count to 10
and youre going to tell me
where the crystal is
one
two
nine
t
the heart of atlantis
lies in the eyes of her king
this is it were in
rourke for the last time
youve got to listen to me
you dont have the slightest idea
what this power is capable of
true but i can think of a few countries
whod pay anything to find out
hurry get on
jackpot
the kings of our past
thatch tell her to wrap it up
we got a schedule to meet
kida
im sorry
come on lets get this over with
i dont like this place
all right thatch whats next
okay theres a giant crystal
hovering 150 feet above our heads
over a bottomless pit of water
doesnt anything surprise you
the only thing that surprises me
is youre still
talking and
that things not on the truck yet
now move it
i dont know how to move it
i dont even know
whats holding it up there
talk to me thatch whats happening
look all it says here
is that the crystal is alive somehow
i dont know how to explain it
its their deity its their power source
speak english professor
theyre a part of it its a part of them
im doing the best i can here
well do better
oh i know
why dont you translate
and ill wave the gun around
what did she say
i dont know i didnt catch it
hold your horses lover boy
kida
no dont dont touch her
all right step back
sergeant keep those people back
you heard him step back
im warning you
so
i guess this is how it ends
fine you win
youre wiping out an entire civilization
but hey youll be rich
congratulations audrey
guess you and your dad will be able
to open up that second garage after all
and vinny you can start
a whole chain of flower shops
im sure your familys
going to be very proud
but thats what its all about right
money
get off your soapbox thatch
youve read darwin
its called natural selection
were just helping it along
commander were ready
yeah give me a minute
i know im forgetting something
i got the cargo the crystal the crew
oh yeah
look at it this way son
you were the man
who discovered atlantis
and now youre part of the exhibit
lets move people
that was an order
not a suggestion lets go
were all going to die
oh you cant be serious
this is wrong and you know it
were this close
to our biggest payday ever
and you pick now of all times
to grow a conscience
weve done a lot of things
were not proud of
robbing graves plundering tombs
double parking but nobody got hurt
well maybe somebody got hurt
but nobody we knew
well if thats the way you want it fine
more for me
pt barnum was right
we cant let him do this
wait a second
okay now you can go
milo you better get up here
hows he doing
not good im afraid
internal bleeding
theres nothing more i can do
what a nightmare
and i brought it here
dont go beating yourself up
hes been after that crystal
since iceland
the crystal sweet thats it
these these crystals
they have some sort of healing energy
ive seen it work
no
where is my daughter
well she
she has been chosen
like her mother before her
what
in times of danger
the crystal will choose a host
one of royal blood to protect itself
and its people
it will accept no other
wait a minute choose
so this thing is alive
in a way
the crystal thrives
on the collective emotions
of all who came before us
in return it provides power
longevity protection
as it grew
it developed
a consciousness of its own
in my arrogance
i sought to use it as a weapon of war
but its power proved
too great to control
it overwhelmed us
and led to our destruction
thats why you hid it beneath the city
to keep history from repeating itself
and to prevent kida from suffering
the same fate as my beloved wife
what do you mean
whats going to happen to kida
if she remains bonded to the crystal
she could be lost to it forever
the love of my daughter
is all i have left
my burden would have become hers
when the time was right
but now it falls to you
me
return the crystal
save atlantis
save my daughter
so whats it going to be
excuse me
i followed you in and ill follow you out
its your decision
oh my decision
well i think weve seen
how effective my decisions have been
lets recap
i lead a band of plundering vandals
to the greatest archeological find
in recorded history
thus enabling the kidnap
andor murder of the royal family
not to mention personally delivering
the most powerful force known to man
into the hands of a mercenary nutcase
whos probably going
to sell it to the kaiser
have i left anything out
well you did set the camp on fire
and drop us down that big hole
thank you
thank you very much
of course its been my experience
when you hit bottom
the only place left to go is up
who told you that
a fella by the name
of thaddeus thatch
where are you going
im going after rourke
milo thats crazy
i didnt say it was the smart thing
but it is the right thing
come on we better make sure
