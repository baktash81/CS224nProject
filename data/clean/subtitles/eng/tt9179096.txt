it is not just about us
akiko is our eldest
they have tried to tell us
that what she has is cerebral palsy
but we knew better
she was born ill and she still is
she will never get better
but our family bonds are strong
akiko is our treasure
we have six children
and we all work hard
to take care of akiko
it takes five hours a day to feed her
but she brings us closer as a family
when you meet her youll see
she is a beautiful soul
we dont want to bring attention
to our family
but we dont have a choice
i drive a truck for chisso
for chisso
but its not enough to take care
of a family with the needs we have
we thank you for your kindness

of akiko tomorrow

good night
good night
last night i rode my bicycle
all the way up to tsunagi
because i heard about one family
at first they didnt want to let me in
i asked them why
they havent been seen
in the neighbourhood lately
i could see the shame on their faces
it turns out their young boy
was very sick with minamata disease
i asked them to join us
that we wanted help
they considered but ultimately
their shame won out and they declined
they love their son just as they should
in all cases of minamata
there is someone to blame
the suffering is caused by an evil
that we know as a fact
so here we are
we have a choice
we can let the world know
if we are loud enough they will listen
accept your responsibility
come on
accept your responsibility
is he alone
i think so
thank you very much
thank you very much
is this yours
how do we turn it to photos
arent you afraid of touching me
thank you
thank you
this way
put your stuff here
its for my aunt
thank you very much
if human beings are still
the masters of creation
we have to overthrow this poisoned world
is this civilisation
is this the socalled
period of rapid growth
but done at the cost
of sacrificing countless lives
our beautiful blue ocean is now made
into a deadly sea by those people
so if you are a human being
please stand up
and fight
remember we never wanted a war
but we have to fight
lets make this the last battle for humanity
please stand up
go go
what are you doing
chisso is winning back
the support of the people
because were influencing
student activists
who are acting violently
against chisso personnel
this is not who we are
chisso are the ones acting violently
we need to stay together on this
or well lose
you know well lose
weve offered good terms
chisso are promising
compensation will be quick
we dont want
any more fighting in the town
or shame brought to minamata
chisso is behind this
you are blind to it
thats not true
is your goal to have chisso
move somewhere else
thats what theyll do
and where will our town be then
this is not just about this town
its about big companies all over the world
invading the towns of
good hardworking people
and polluting their existence
its happened before
and it will happen again
dont get so emotional
calm down
dont cause any trouble
we understand how you feel
we are all in the same pain
but we all want it to end
the signatures speak for themselves
the people have spoken
this is the right way
to settle the matter
for all
no more fighting
may we see the book
thats not necessary
have you pressed your signature
on this document
no
and you
and you
they have overwhelming
signatures of support in the book
yet they wont show it
do we believe this is fair
let us see the book
show us show us
thats my signature i never pressed it
that guy is dead how could he have signed
youre right he is dead
whats going on here
tell us
youre full of lies

shigro
some people may come and go
with the best of intentions
but we cant count on them
this is our fight
why do you think chisso are hitting us
harder and harder
why do you think theyre getting
bolder and bolder
you know why
they can threaten us
but we are going
to the shareholders meeting
hello
im not good at public speaking
i believe that a picture
worths a thousand words
i want to help you
but i need your help too
i want to spend some
precious time with your families
if i did this
i will be able to help you
to win your fight
does anyone agree to be photographed
thank you
are you drunk
you are murderers
how many people are outside
over 500
yes
mr president
we know there is verdict
that will arrive soon
we hope that chisso will accept
responsibility for its negligence
we are not here for luxuries
just to know that we will be looked after
and able to die in peace
if you are human
listen to what we are saying
i and sadae ogata
i understand that you dont know who i am
but you should
both of my daughters fell ill
both suffered more than i can imagine
anyone suffering let alone a child
my eldest daughter suffered
from convulsions for months
so much pain that she couldnt cry
she is dead now
and my other daughter miyuki
will never be able
to spend a day without care
my husband and i cry often
we weep because we fear
for what will happen
when we are no longer able
to take care of her
mr president
youve got nothing to say
you are a human being too right
we are the same and yet
how can we be this different
how can we
i am sorry i truly am
what happened to you
what you have gone through
brings sorrow in our hearts
please forgive us
my child also has minamata disease
he is nine years old
i work on the boats still
when the fishermen allow me to
but because of my symptoms
they dont want me on their boats
so its my wife that needs to work
she works on the boats sometimes
and many nights she is forced
to take care of both of us
she cant do that forever
can she
mr president
we know that you will pay
for the old victims
but you must pay the same
for the new victims as well
its your responsibility
am i wrong
mr uyishi can i have a moment
thank you all for coming
and speaking with me
your plight brings me much sadness
but weve added up
the costs of your demands
however
we simply cannot pay
unfortunately this is our final answer
i cant take this anymore
kyushi kyushi
they dont believe were in pain
this blood is on your hands
kyushi
are you okay
can i move akikos legs
excuse me
can i move akikos left hand
yes
akiko i will move your hand
we have to pay
somehow we will find a way
we must
we won
today we have won the battle
but the war persists
we must continue to fight
to fight for our children
so their children have something
that they can fight for
but all of you here
and the people who stood with us
have taught me that this a fight
