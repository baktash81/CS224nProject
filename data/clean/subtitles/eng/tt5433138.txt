la calle está que pela
siempre andamos en el ocio
la máquina de museo
la paseo porque
la calle está que pela
nos cuidamos de lo feo
por de calle lo fronteo
aquí lo veo
tu di se que le metes cabrón
ya vi porque eres un mamón
tu sales conmigo ni pelas el día
gol
ni pegó para la portería
la calle está que pela
siempre andamos en el ocio
la máquina de museo
la paseo porque
la calle está que pela
nos cuidamos de lo feo
por de calle lo fronteo
aquí lo veo
