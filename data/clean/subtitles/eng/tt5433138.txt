oh i love being rich
jakob
it was sloppy he almost had me
she say anything
nope nada
you know i look at her
and i feel creeped out
and sort of turned on
at the same time
is that weird
electrical whirring
cipher
nice operation
you snatched me off
mr nobodys plane midair
without a scratch
and you took him down
money well spent
do you know who i am
i know who you are
do you
east la is a tough enough
place to grow up
but it was your brothers shadow
that turned you into this
isnt it
so your whole life you pushed
yourself to be faster than dom
smarter than dom
stronger than dom
tell me do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night
whispers
still
all these years later
i shouldve just hired you
instead of coercing your
brother a couple of years back
i dont work
for the competition
thats cute
you thinking
youre the competition
says the woman in the box
look familiar
the other halfs hidden
in one of the agencys
thousands of vaults
i need you to find out
which one
we secured the master drive here
from mr nobodys plane
the rest of the hardware
is a bit dated
preinternet
to make sure you dont go
hack into anything
we dont want you to
say you get what youre after
a weapon so dangerous
it shouldnt exist
for another half century
what would you do with it
launch some global attack
sell it to the highest bidder
or maybe you see yourself
as a necessary shock
to the system
i bet all you ever wanted
was a hug
you read my psych eval
good for you
i read your secondgrade
report card
thats what i do
typing
your chin its distinctive
i know the torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines
but i never detected
a nordic strain
typing
finding the two halves of
project aries is the easy part
add in your brother dom
to the mix

you dont have a chance
plans are in motion

roman
i dont think they had grids
when this place was built
if a ninja turtle pop out on me

sanctioned by the agency
this was definitely
mr nobodys secret hideout
switch clanks
electricity powering up
what now dom
whoever jakob has become
and whatever hes up to
its on me
and me alone
roman
nah
whatevers on you its on us
lets get to work
rap music playing quietly
over speakers
clears throat
yall ever thought about how
many wild missions we been on
how we somehow
always survive
tej chuckles yeah
so far so good i guess
its just luck
roman no no no see
yall not listening
think about this
weve now been
on insane missions
around the world
doing what most would say is
damn near impossible
and i aint got one single scar
to show for it
i mean look at my jacket
those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head
clean off its shoulders
weve taken out
cars trains tanks
im not gonna even
mention the submarine
and yet were still here
exactly
ramsey what happens
when you test a theory
over and over again only
to come to the same result
a hypothesis becomes fact
but youre not actually
suggesting that
i dont know
but when the improbable happens
again and again
thats more than luck
maybe were not so normal
roman
thats what im saying
we are not normal
okay um
just to clarify
are you two maybe suggesting
that were what
invincible
maybe
maybe
or maybe
youre just a dumbass
tej and ramsey laughing
take your dumbass jacket
with you man scoffs
pretty impressive driving
out there
you miss the old life
do you
gun racks
every day
tej
guys
we got a little company

its so good to see you
mia i missed you

dom listen to me
my kids and yours are
in the safest hands possible
with brian
our worlds grown dom
i got this one
ramsey
the firewall on this old thing
is actually pretty good
but you know port scan
udp message peek
pop to root shell and
computer beeping
say hello to project aries
what is it
its what we got from
mr nobodys plane
or at least part of it
aries was designed
to override and assimilate
anything that runs on code
any computer anywhere
if it operates on zeros
and ones its vulnerable
if you take aries
and upload it to a satellite
itll spread like a virus
then itll be a matter of time
before someone can control
any weapon system
traditional nuclear
stuff we havent even seen yet
and just point it
wherever they want
jakob reboots the world order
within minutes
tej
ares is the god of war right
if jakob gets his hands on this
hell be the god
of damn near everything
ramsey
because of how dangerous it was
the aries prototype
was recovered
and split into two halves
by mr nobody
both of which are worthless
without the activation key
jakob now has one of the pieces
hell be going after
the other half next
as for the key its
its vanished
so we find it
if were gonna beat jakob to it
were gonna have to split up
roman tej
i know a couple of guys
operating out of germany that
could get us anything we need
im on it
wait theres one more thing
mr nobodys transmission
had one name
connected to the key
you guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this
letty

how about
we stay in one place
where you thinking
tokyo
we always talk about tokyo
tokyo it is
han you know its funny
gisele led me there
and i wasnt even
looking for it
but it became home
then one day
mr nobody came calling
mr nobody
i worked with gisele
back when i was a cia operative
running the drug trade
in central america
the good old days
gisele was my best
you can lose an asset
at any time
bullet knife wire
but i never thought
id lose her
to love
sighs
what do you want
im offering you a job han
here in tokyo
why me
cause i saw your work
with gisele
i saw that she trusted you
and that means i can trust you
and that is very rare
in this line of work
crunching
han and all i knew
was that i had to steal
some tech from the home
of a scientist couple
but as usual
mr nobody didnt
tell me everything
in fact he left out
the most important part
i was 11
my parents would take me
to the movies on saturdays
if i tried hard in school
during the week
i was so excited to go
i forgot my raincoat
so i went back in
thunder rumbling softly
at first i didnt see it
by the time
i looked out the window
mom and dad were gone
han turns out
i wasnt the only one
looking for this thing
explosion booms
clattering
men chattering
in foreign language
elle crying softly
men chattering
gunfire
men grunting
han
get down
han groans
elle
han saved me
wouldnt leave me behind
he knew id always be a target
so he taught me how to survive
we became a family
always be a target
why
dom
cause she is the key
everybodys been looking
for a thing
it was a person all along
elle
my parents didnt want
project aries to fall
into the wrong hands
so they locked it with their
own dna something we share
and then one day
mr nobody gave me the headsup
that one of his best agents
went rogue
so when deckard shaw
came calling
we used it as cover
but you got killed
in a car crash han
mr nobody had a way
of making things look real
people screaming
pretty nifty magic trick
yeah ive done better
now for the hard part
device beeps
keeping you dead
siren wailing in distance
my death
became the best way
to stay alive

dom you ever think about
how mr nobody found you

ive been looking for that key
for a long time dom
and you just handed her over
i told you

you know the only good thing
to come from dad dying
if he hadnt id have spent
my entire life in your shadow
and now youre gonna spend the
rest of yours living in mine
dom only good thing
about dad dying
was he didnt have to watch
what you became
you never deserved
the toretto name
you think you knew dad huh
what cause you were his
favorite you dont know shit
okay
you want the truth
dad died cause he was trying
to throw that race
we were in deep debt
cause of how he felt about you
he had to ask me for help
how was i supposed to know
that car was gonna blow
a good son wouldve said no
and a real brother
wouldve come to me
come to you
he made me promise
you would never find out

all he needs to do is
send the signal global
and then theres
no stopping him ever
ramsey hell have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite
something thatll act
as an amplifier
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one
so we find him stop him
and then we get elle back
our odds are zero here han
satellite equipment is
easy enough to track
but were not gonna
beat jakob to a launch
ramsey which gives us
a twotarget problem
jakob on the ground
with his own private army
and the satellite
ramsey which cant be hacked
not remotely
wed have to do it physically
50 miles above ground while
the satellite is in orbit
orbit
we need help
otherwise we have no chance
dom
we do it ourselves
its where weve been
that got us this far
no no no no no no
do yall not understand

were literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall

what does that even mean
roman it means
numbers dont lie
as long as we obey
the laws of physics
then well be fine okay
its just all math and science
i knew i shouldve listened
to my teachers
sean over radio
four minutes to launch
you fellas good to go
yeah we just up here putting
a bunch of duct tape on shit
you know thats what tej do
man please hurry up so i can

you moving your tongue like
youre coming against me
you hurt in your feelings
convertible ceilings
one push of a button
you coming up missing
count it up tuck it
take nothing offensive
touching them ms
what i love turned against me
left me no choice
but the run it up issue
i hit em hard i hit em
hard i hit em hard
i hit em hard
ready to eat
never gon starve
run with the beasts
swim with the sharks
ima get mine
put it on god
ice like the cross
now who the boss
i hit em hard i hit em
hard i hit em hard
i hit em hard
i got that heat
coming in hard
pull out the flame
ready to spark
turn up the beat
tear it apart
tear off the leash im in
the yard i hit em hard
im in the dark
diamond they dancing
they hitting real hard
in the push start
running my engine
in the back of the car
i took off the chip
and im pushing my limits
im going real fast
im going real far
i told her dont with
the bosses and business
i stay in my bag
i know im a star
i stay with
them crash dummies
we dont give a
we hitting em hard
and im using my brain 100
i dont need a charge
used to play
on the handlebars
now we handling firearms
just lend me the gas
and ill do the dash
ill puff puff and pass
cant think bout the past
i hit em hard

pasa el tiempo
y yo sigo aquí
un hermano no se traiciona
la familia nunca abandona
pasa el tiempo
y yo sigo aquí
un hermano no se traiciona
la familia nunca abandona
y yo no he cambiado
por más dinero
por una mujer
que la envidia no vive
con nosotros se muere
y yo no he cambiado
por más dinero
por una mujer
que la envidia no vive
con nosotros se muere
la calle está que pela
siempre andamos en el ocio
la máquina de museo
la paseo porque
la calle está que pela
nos cuidamos de lo feo
por de calle lo fronteo
aquí no lo veo
tu di se que le metes cabrón
ya vi porque eres un mamón
tu no sales conmigo
ni me pelas el día
no no
gol
y ni me pegó
para la portería
la calle está que pela
siempre andamos en el ocio
la máquina de museo
la paseo porque
la calle está que pela
