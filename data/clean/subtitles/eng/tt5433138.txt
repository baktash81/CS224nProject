at the same time 
is that weird 
 electrical whirring

nice operation 
you snatched me off
mr  nobody s plane midair
without a scratch 
and you took him down 
money well spent 
  do you know who i am 
  i know who you are 
do you 
east l a  is a tough enough
place to grow up 
but it was your brother s shadow
that turned you into this 
isn t it 
so your whole life  you pushed
yourself to be faster than dom 
smarter than dom 
stronger than dom 
tell me  do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night 
 whispers  
still 
all these years later 
i should ve just hired you
instead of coercing your
brother a couple of years back 
i don t work

that s cute 
you thinking
you re the competition 
says the woman in the box 
look familiar 
the other half s hidden
in one of the agency s
thousands of vaults 
i need you to find out
which one 
we secured the master drive here
from mr  nobody s plane 
the rest of the hardware
is a bit dated 
pre internet 
to make sure you don t go
hack into anything
we don t want you to 
say you get what you re after 
a weapon so dangerous
it shouldn t exist
for another half century 
what would you do with it 
launch some global attack 
sell it to the highest bidder 
or maybe you see yourself
as a necessary shock
to the system 
i bet all you ever wanted
was a hug 
you read my psych eval 
good for you 
i read your second grade
report card 
that s what i do 
 typing 
your chin    it s distinctive 
i know the torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines

 rap music playing quietly

y all ever thought about how
many wild missions we been on 
how we somehow   
  always survive 
  tej  chuckles   yeah 
  so far  so good  i guess 
  it s just luck 
roman  no  no  no  see 
y all not listening 
think about this 
we ve now been
on insane missions
around the world 
doing what most would say is
damn near impossible 
and i ain t got one single scar
to show for it 
i mean  look at my jacket 
those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head
clean off its shoulders 
we ve taken out
cars  trains  tanks 
i m not gonna even
mention the submarine 
and yet we re still here 
exactly 
ramsey  what happens
when you test a theory
over and over again only
to come to the same result 
a hypothesis becomes fact 
but you re not actually
suggesting that   
i don t know 
but when the improbable happens
again and again 
that s more than luck 
maybe we re not so normal 
roman 
that s what i m saying 
we are not normal 
okay  um   
just to clarify 
are you two maybe suggesting
that we re what 
invincible 
  maybe 
  maybe 
or maybe   
you re just a dumbass 
 tej and ramsey laughing 
take your dumbass jacket
with you  man   scoffs 
pretty impressive driving
out there 
you miss the old life

  it s so good to see you 
  mia  i missed you 
thank you

of course 
you should ve told me 
she deserved to know 
jakob s my brother  too 
i need to be here 
you get involved here  you put
everything you have at risk 
your kids and the whole world
that you built 
we re all risking something 
dom  listen to me 
my kids and yours are
in the safest hands possible 
with brian 
our world s grown  dom 
i got this one 
ramsey 
the firewall on this old thing
is actually pretty good 
but  you know  port scan 
udp message peek 
pop to root shell  and   
 computer beeping 
   say hello to project aries 
what is it 
it s what we got from
mr  nobody s plane 
or at least part of it 
aries was designed
to override and assimilate
anything that runs on code 
any computer anywhere 
if it operates on zeros
and ones  it s vulnerable 
if you take aries
and upload it to a satellite 
it ll spread like a virus 
then it ll be a matter of time
before someone can control
any weapon system   
traditional  nuclear 
stuff we haven t even seen yet   
and just point it
wherever they want 
jakob reboots the world order
within minutes 
tej 
ares is the god of war  right 
if jakob gets his hands on this 
he ll be the god
of damn near everything 
ramsey 
because of how dangerous it was 
the aries prototype
was recovered
and split into two halves
by mr  nobody 
both of which are worthless
without the activation key 
jakob now has one of the pieces 
he ll be going after
the other half next 
as for the key  it s   
it s vanished 
so we find it 
if we re gonna beat jakob to it 
we re gonna have to split up 
roman  tej 
i know a couple of guys
operating out of germany that
could get us anything we need 
i m on it 
wait  there s one more thing 
mr  nobody s transmission
had one name
connected to the key 
you guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this 
letty 
no way 
that s exactly what i said 
roman  so you re saying
han s death is connected
to all of this 
he has to have
something to do with it 
letty 
i ll look into it 
tej  can you send me
  all the files you have on han 
  yeah 
i ll go with you

you ve got people who love you 
count on you  care for you 
he ain t got no one 
you get in his way 
this ain t gonna end
until one of you guys

if he has all the information
we do  probably 
i never told dom   
i stayed in touch with him for
a while after what happened 
he was over at buddy s
for about a year  and then   
he was gone with
a message not to follow 
but after he disappeared 
i was so desperate to find him
that i would ve   
would ve done anything 
i even broke into
a police archive 
but i didn t find anything 
you what 
you were like 16 
i did what i had to do 
yeah 
how about you 
how are you doing 
 chuckles  
it s a change of pace  huh 
just as i was remembering   
   who i was 
everything changed 
it slowed down

it s like i    i need to face
the world head on or something
to feel alive 
seeing little brian
hiding in a hole because
we had unexpected company   
   that got to me 
we never used to hide 
hey  dom s my brother  but you

running the drug trade
in central america 
the good old days 
gisele was my best 
you can lose an asset

to love 
 sighs 
what do you want 
i m offering you a job  han 
here  in tokyo 
why me 
 cause i saw your work
with gisele 
i saw that she trusted you 
and that means i can trust you 
and that is very rare
in this line of work 
 crunching 
han  and all i knew
was that i had to steal
some tech from the home
of a scientist couple 
but as usual   
mr  nobody didn t
tell me everything 
in fact  he left out
the most important part 
i was 11 
my parents would take me
to the movies on saturdays
if i tried hard in school
during the week 
i was so excited to go
i forgot my raincoat 
so i went back in 
 thunder rumbling softly 
at first  i didn t see it 
by the time
i looked out the window   
mom and dad were gone 
han  turns out
i wasn t the only one

why 
dom 
 cause she is the key 
everybody s been looking
for a thing 
it was a person all along 
elle 
my parents didn t want
project aries to fall
into the wrong hands 
so they locked it with their
own dna  something we share 
and then  one day 
mr  nobody gave me the heads up
that one of his best agents
went rogue 
so when deckard shaw
came calling 
we used it as cover 
but you got killed
in a car crash  han 
mr  nobody had a way
of making things look real 
 people screaming 
pretty nifty magic trick 
yeah  i ve done better 
now for the hard part

that car was gonna blow 
a good son would ve said no 
and a real brother

ramsey 
from here  things move quickly 
jakob has all the pieces
he needs 
once he activates aries 
all he needs to do is
send the signal global 
and then there s
no stopping him  ever 
ramsey  he ll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite 
something that ll act
as an amplifier 
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one 
so we find him  stop him 
and then we get elle back 
our odds are zero here  han 
satellite equipment is
easy enough to track 
but we re not gonna
beat jakob to a launch 
ramsey  which gives us
a two target problem 
jakob on the ground   
with his own private army 
  and the satellite 
  ramsey  which can t be hacked 
not remotely 
we d have to do it physically 
50 miles above ground while
the satellite is in orbit 
orbit 
we need help 
otherwise  we have no chance 
dom 
we do it ourselves 
it s where we ve been
that got us this far 
no  no  no  no  no  no 
do y all not understand 
clearly  y all don t 
because if you did 
you d be pissing your pants
