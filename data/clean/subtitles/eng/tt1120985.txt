somehow she didnt want to confess to
him  that she was so weary
of all those people  whod seem
to want to care about her
he touched her cheek gently caressingly
her heart was bitting so loudly
that surely he could hear it
arms up he smooths your hair back
the touch of his fingers sending waves of awareness through her
he was going to kiss her that whas what
she wanted wasnt it
so why that she feel as if she trembled on the
edge of the precimes ready to top ower in an instant
then his lips founds hers and she stopped thinking at all
only feeling feeling the tenderness of his
kiss  the strength of his arms around her
the steady beat of his heart
under her hand as she turned into his arms
there is a precipice and she was falling head
over heels falling in love with him chapter 11
