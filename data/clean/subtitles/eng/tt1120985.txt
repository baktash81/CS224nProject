somehow she didn t want to confess to
him  that she was so weary
of all those people  who d seem
to want to care about her 
he touched her cheek gently  caressingly 
her heart was bitting so loudly
that surely he could hear it 
arms up   he smooths your hair back
the touch of his fingers sending waves of awareness through her 
he was going to kiss her    that whas what
she wanted  wasn t it 
so why that she feel as if she trembled on the
edge of the precimes ready to top ower in an instant 
then his lips founds hers and she stopped thinking at all 
only feeling  feeling the tenderness of his
kiss   the strength of his arms around her 
the steady beat of his heart
under her hand as she turned into his arms 
there is a precipice and she was falling head
over heels  falling in love with him  chapter 11
