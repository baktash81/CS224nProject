that the eating of venison
has risen 30 percent in the last few years 
sixty percent of that s from road kill 
people eat road kill 
if you re driving out here
at 70 miles an hour   
    and a deer darts out in front of you
if you blink or brake or swerve

princess wise is gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on 
they are stealing biochemical weapons 
dc2

designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled land locked area 
and you were supplying it to them 
so why d they shut you out 
they ve found my supply 
it s under our feet 
ten stories down 
the only treatment is a regimented
exposure to dc 2 itself 
delays the negative effects 
they need it 
like a drug 
correct 
but we found that a small percentage
of people are not affected by the gas itself 
and within this small percentage lies a cure 
what do you wanna do 
mexico

don t scream for help 
don t even breathe
