field army base
el wray

i saw him in the convoy earlier
im a scientist
and a businessman
not military
princess wise is gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on
they are stealing biochemical weapons
dc2
also known as project terror
designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled land locked area
and you were supplying it to them
so whyd they shut you out
theyve found my supply
its under our feet
ten stories down
the only treatment is a regimented
exposure to dc2 itself
delays the negative effects
they need it
like a drug
correct
but we found that a small percentage
of people are not affected by the gas itself
and within this small percentage lies a cure
what do you wanna do
mexico
put our backs against the ocean
and defend ourselves from there
no we have to get back to my lab
this infection will spread all over the world
to every man woman and child
unless i finish my antidote
you have an antidote
you
you
come with us
move it
do you like ava gardner
sorry
ava gardner
do you like her
yeah i guess
im just thinking that you
kinda look like
ava gardner a little bit

wanna say to me
i have nothing to say to you
youve nothing to say huh
thats funny
cause i coulda swear you just give
me a fuck you look great now
you wanna say fuck you to me
not at this moment
you know what this is
a gun
its simplicity itself
you see you point it
at what you want to die
and you pull the little trigger here
and a bullet comes out here
and the bullet hits you right there
and you know what
you dont look like
ava gardner no more
dont taunt me tramp
i am not one to be taunted
you got it
let me hear you say  i got it
i got it
youre damn more better
salt
get it i figured out its salt
blood is salty
thats all my sauce needed
which is a little more salt
just needed a little thickening agent
you know what im talking about
what are you doing jt
thats all i got to do to put a
little more salt in
to do the same goddamn thing that blood did
im telling you my brothers
that little bit of blood did the trick

i put two in his heart
one in his computer
so that was you
yeah
that was me
he wasnt supposed to be there
we werent supposed to be there
and i sure as fuck wasnt supposed
to be the one who punches  ticket
so instead of a chest full of medals
we got a face full of dc2
no cure
there is none till we find
somebody from the other side
willing to sell us batches of this shit
science comes first
but business comes a close fucking second
then you realized if you could infect
a large enough populace
and experiment on its survivals
youd find a cure
i swore to my men that id do everything
in my power to keep them alive
thats what i intend to do wray
understand
i never had a choice
neither do i sir
god bless you and
your service to this country

and the end of germany borman
you have been chosen
rejoice
they have found the perfect solution
the shedevils of belzac
can they alone supply the blood
needed to save hitlers mad dreams
or with the pride of germany fall into ruin
this is my project
we are now in total control of pure wolf
featuring udo kier
sheri moon zombie
tom towles
this is my mecca
if you
are thinking
of going
into
this house
if you
are thinking
of opening
this door
if you
are thinking
of checking out
the basement
dont look behind
dont look in there
dont look up
dont look anywhere
dont scream for help
dont even breathe
