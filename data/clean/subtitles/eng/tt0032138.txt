if i only had a brain
id unravel every riddle
for any individle
in trouble or in pain
with the thoughts youd be thinkin

and think some more
i would not be just a nothin
my head all full of stuff in
my heart all full of pain

do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerful oz
i said come back tomorrow
if you were really great and powerful
youd keep your promises
do you presume to criticize
the great oz
you ungrateful creatures
think yourselves lucky
that im giving you audience tomorrow
instead of 20 years from now
oh
the great oz has spoken oh
pay no attention
to that man behind the curtain
the great and
oz has spoken
who are you
i am the great and powerful
wizard of oz
you are i dont believe you
im afraid its true
theres no other wizard except me
you humbug
yeah
yes thats exactly so im a humbug
dorothy oh
youre a very bad man
oh no my dear im a very good man
im just a very bad wizard
what about the heart
you promised tin man
and the courage you promised
cowardly lion
and scarecrows brain
and scarecrows brain
why anybody can have a brain
thats a very mediocre commodity
every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth
or slinks through slimy seas
has a brain
back where i come from
we have universities
seats of great learning
where men go to become great thinkers
they think deep thoughts
and with no more brains than you have
but they have one thing
you havent got a diploma
therefore by virtue
of the authority vested in me
by the universitatus committeeatum
e pluribus unum
i hereby confer upon you
the honorary degree of th d
th d
thats doctor of thinkology
the sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side
oh joy rapture
ive got a brain
how can i thank you enough
well you cant
as for you my fine friend
youre a victim of disorganized thinking
you are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger
you have no courage
youre confusing courage with wisdom
back where i come from
we have men who are called heroes
once a year they take
their fortitude out of mothballs
and parade it down the main street
and they have no more courage
than you have
but they have one thing
that you havent got a medal
therefore
for meritorious
conduct extraordinary valor
conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches
i award you the triple cross
you are now a member
of the legion of courage
shucks folks im speechless
as for you my galvanized friend
you want a heart
you dont know how lucky you are
not to have one
hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable
but i still want one
back where i come from there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds
they are called phil
gooddeeddoers and their hearts
are no bigger than yours
but they have one thing
you havent got a testimonial
therefore in consideration
of your kindness
i take pleasure at this time
in presenting you
with a small token
of our esteem and affection
and remember
my sentimental friend
that a heart is not judged
by how much you love
but by how much you are loved
by others
ah
ticking
oh it ticks
listen look it ticks
read what my medal says
courage
aint it the truth
aint it the truth
oh theyre all wonderful
hey what about dorothy
tin man yes how about dorothy
yeah dorothy next
i dont think theres anything
in that black bag for me
you force me into
a cataclysmic decision
the only way to get dorothy to kansas
is for me to take her myself
gasps
oh will you could you oh
but are you clever enough
to manage it
child you cut me to the quick im an
old kansas man myself born and bred
in the western wilderness
premier balloonist par excellence
to the miracle wonderland
carnival company
until one day while performing
feats of stratospheric skill
never before attempted
by civilized man
an unfortunate phenomena occurred
the balloon failed to return to the fair
it did
werent you frightened
you are talking to a man who has
laughed in the face of death
sneered at doom and chuckled
at catastrophe i was petrified
suddenly the wind changed
and the balloon floated down
into this noble city
where i was instantly acclaimed oz
the first wizard deluxe
times being what they were
i accepted the job
retaining my balloon against
the advent of a quick getaway ha ha
and in that balloon dear dorothy
you and i will return to
the land of e pluribus unum
wizard
my friends i mean my friends
crowd cheering
this is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown
be that as it may
i your wizard per ardua ad alta
am about to embark
upon a hazardous
and technically
unexplainable journey
into the outer stratosphere
crowd cheering
to confer converse
and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards
and i hereby decree
that until what time
if any that i return
the scarecrow by virtue
of his highly superior brains
shall rule in my stead
assisted by the tin man
by virtue of his magnificent heart
and the lion
by virtue of his courage
obey them as you would me thank you
barking
cat meows
oh toto
come back toto
toto dont go without me
ill be right back
tin man stop that dog
this is a highly irregular procedure
this is absolutely unprecedented
ruined my exit
dorothy come back come back
dont go without me
please come back
wizard i cant come back
i dont know how it works
goodbye folks
crowd goodbye
oh now ill never get home
stay with us then dorothy
we all love you
we dont want you to go
thats very kind of you
but this could never be like kansas
auntie em must have stopped wondering
what happened to me by now
oh scarecrow
what am i going to do
look
heres someone who can help you
will you help me can you help me
you dont need help any longer
youve always had the power
to go back to kansas
i have
then why didnt you tell her before
because she wouldnt have believed me
she had to learn it for herself
what have you learned dorothy
well
i think that it
that it wasnt enough just to want
to see uncle henry and auntie em
and its that if i ever go looking
for my hearts desire again
i wont look any further
than my own back yard
because if it isnt there
i never really lost it to begin with
is that right
thats all it is
but thats so easy
i shouldve thought of it for you
i shouldve felt it in my heart
she had to find it out for herself
now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds
toto too
toto too
now
whenever you wish
oh dear
thats too wonderful to be true
oh its
its gonna be so hard
to say goodbye
i love you all too
goodbye tin man
oh dont cry
youll rust so dreadfully
here heres your oilcan
goodbye
now i know ive got a heart
because its breaking
goodbye lion
i know it isnt right
but im gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help
before you found your courage
i would never have found it
if it hadnt been for you
i think ill miss you most of all
are you ready now
yes
say goodbye toto
yes im ready now
then close your eyes
and tap your heels
together three times
and think to yourself
theres no place like home
