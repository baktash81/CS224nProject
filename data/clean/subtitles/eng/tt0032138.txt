the house began to pitch 
the kitchen took a slitch 
it landed on the wicked witch
in the middle of a ditch 
which was not a healthy situation
for the wicked witch 
the house began to pitch

 singing  i could while away the hours
conferring with the flowers 
consulting with the rain 
and my head i d be scratchin 
while my thoughts were busy hatchin  
if i only had a brain 
i d unravel every riddle
for any individ le 
in trouble or in pain 
with the thoughts you d be thinkin 
you could be another lincoln 
if you only had a brain 
oh  i could tell you why 
the ocean s near the shore 
i could think of things
i never thunk before 
and then i d sit
and think some more 
i would not be just a nothin 
my head all full of stuff in  
my heart all full of pain 
i would dance and be merry
life would be a ding a derry 
if i only had a brain

  but maybe you better not 
i ve got a witch mad at me 
and you might get into trouble 
witch  i m not afraid of a witch 
i m not afraid of anything 
  except a lighted match 
  i don t blame you for that 
but i d face a whole box of them
for the chance of getting some brains 
look  i won t be any trouble

how did you ever get like this

i was chopping that tree   
when suddenly it began to rain 
and right in the middle of a chop 
i rusted solid 
and i ve been that way ever since 
well  you re perfect now 
my neck  my neck 
perfect 
bang on my chest
if you think i m perfect 
go ahead  bang on it 
 knocking echoes 
beautiful  what an echo 
it s empty 
the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart 
  no heart 
  no heart 
no heart 
all hollow 
 singing 
when a man s an empty kettle 
he should be on his mettle 
and yet i m torn apart 
just because i m presumin 
that i could be kind of human 
if i only had a heart 
i d be tender  i d be gentle
and awful sentimental 
regarding love and art 
i d be friends with the sparrows 
and the boy who shoots the arrows 
if i only had a heart 
picture me a balcony 
above  a voice sings low 
woman  singing  
wherefore an  thou  romeo 
i hear a beat 
how sweet 
just to register emotion
jealousy  devotion 
and really feel the part 
i could stay young and chipper
and i d lock it with a zipper 
if i only had a heart
 joints squeaking 
 vvhistles 
 inaudible dialogue 
oh  oh  oh  oh  oh 
  are you all right 
  i m a little rusty yet 
oh  dear 
that was wonderful 
you know   
we were wondering
why you couldn t come with us   
to the emerald city
to ask the wizard of oz for a heart 
suppose the wizard wouldn t
give me one when we got there 
oh  but he will 
he must 
we ve come such a long way already

a fate i don t deserve 
  i d be brave as a blizzard 
  i d be gentle as a lizard

  you humbug

what about the heart
you promised tin man 
and the courage you promised
cowardly lion 
  and scarecrow s brain 
  and scarecrow s brain 
why  anybody can have a brain 
that s a very mediocre commodity 
every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth   
or slinks through slimy seas
has a brain 
back where i come from 
we have universities   
seats of great learning 
where men go to become great thinkers 
they think deep thoughts 
and with no more brains than you have 
but they have one thing
you haven t got  a diploma 
therefore  by virtue
of the authority vested in me   
by the universitatus committeeatum
e pluribus unum   
i hereby confer upon you   
     the honorary degree of th  d 
  th  d  
that s doctor of thinkology 
the sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle   
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side 
oh  joy  rapture 
i ve got a brain 
  how can i thank you enough 
  well  you can t 
as for you  my fine friend 
you re a victim of disorganized thinking 
you are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger   
you have no courage 
you re confusing courage with wisdom 
back where i come from 
we have men who are called  heroes  
once a year  they take
their fortitude out of mothballs   
and parade it down the main street 
and they have no more courage
than you have 
but they have one thing
that you haven t got  a medal 
therefore   
for meritorious   
conduct  extraordinary valor   
conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches   
i award you the triple cross 
you are now a member
of the legion of courage 
shucks  folks  i m speechless 
as for you  my galvanized friend 
you want a heart 
you don t know how lucky you are
not to have one 
hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable 
but i still want one 
back where i come from  there are men
who do nothing all day but good deeds 
they are called phil   
good deed doers  and their hearts
are no bigger than yours 
but they have one thing
you haven t got  a testimonial 
therefore  in consideration
of your kindness   
i take pleasure at this time
in presenting you   
with a small token
of our esteem and affection 
and remember 
my sentimental friend   
that a heart is not judged
by how much you love   
but by how much you are loved
by others 
ah 
 ticking 
oh  it ticks 
listen  look  it ticks 
read what my medal says 
 courage  
ain t it the truth 
ain t it the truth 
oh  they re all wonderful 
hey  what about dorothy 
tin man  yes  how about dorothy 
  yeah  dorothy next 
i don t think there s anything
in that black bag for me 
you force me into
a cataclysmic decision 
the only way to get dorothy to kansas
is for me to take her myself 
 gasps 
oh  will you  could you  oh 
but are you clever enough   
to manage it 
child  you cut me to the quick  i m an
old kansas man myself  born and bred   
in the western wilderness 
premier balloonist par excellence   
to the miracle wonderland
carnival company 
until one day  while performing
feats of stratospheric skill   
never before attempted
by civilized man   
an unfortunate phenomena occurred 
the balloon failed to return to the fair 
it did 
weren t you frightened 
you are talking to a man who has
laughed in the face of death   
sneered at doom and chuckled
at catastrophe  i was petrified 
suddenly the wind changed   
and the balloon floated down
into this noble city   
where i was instantly acclaimed oz 
the first wizard deluxe 
times being what they were 
i accepted the job   
retaining my balloon against
the advent of a quick getaway  ha  ha 
and in that balloon  dear dorothy   
you and i will return to
the land of e pluribus unum 
wizard 
my friends  i mean  my friends 
 crowd cheering 
this is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown   
be that as it may 
i  your wizard per ardua ad alta   
am about to embark
upon a hazardous   
and technically
unexplainable journey   
into the outer stratosphere 
 crowd cheering 
to confer  converse   
and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards 
and i hereby decree
that until what time   
if any  that i return   
the scarecrow  by virtue
of his highly superior brains   
shall rule in my stead   
assisted by the tin man 
by virtue of his magnificent heart   
and the lion 
by virtue of his courage 
obey them as you would me  thank you 
 barking 
 cat meows 
oh  toto 
come back  toto 
toto  don t go without me

tin man  stop that dog 
this is a highly irregular procedure 
this is absolutely unprecedented 
  ruined my exit

  then why didn t you tell her before 
because she wouldn t have believed me 
she had to learn it for herself 
what have you learned  dorothy 
well   
i think that it   
that it wasn t enough just to want
to see uncle henry and auntie em 
and it s that if i ever go looking
for my heart s desire again   
i won t look any further
than my own back yard   
because if it isn t there   
i never really lost it to begin with 
is that right 
that s all it is 
but that s so easy 
i should ve thought of it for you 
  i should ve felt it in my heart 
  she had to find it out for herself 
now those magic slippers will
take you home in two seconds
