commissioners of the admiralty
and i quote   to enquire into the cause
and circumstances of the seizure
of his majesty s armed vessel 
the bounty 
commanded by
lieutenant william bligh
and to try the said
lieutenant william bligh
for his conduct
on that occasion  
surrender your sword
and be seated 
lieutenant bligh 
perhaps it would be useful if you
told the court in your own words
the events
of april 28th last year 
yes  sir  if it please  my lords 
i will first read a list of the mutineers
who seized my ship 
the crew is not on trial here 
mr bligh  you  sir  are on trial 
the question at issue is
how you came to lose your ship 
to understand that  captain greetham 
it is essential to know
who were the mutineers
aboard that ship 
alleged mutineers 
continue  mr bligh 
fletcher christian 
masters mate 
wasn t this christian
a friend of yours 
he was  sir 
fifty guineas says he s dead 
  sixty says he s alive 
  i ll wager he s still alive 
how much 
we ll dine within the hour 
  how much 
  sixty guineas 
taken 
i ll be back to collect it 
william 
fletcher 
what are you all doing 
one of our members collapsed 
we re betting on
whether or not he s dead 
  what brings you to this den of iniquity 
  is there somewhere we can talk 
it s a breadfruit 
breadfruit 
the admiralty has instructed me
to lead an expedition 
to take breadfruit plants
from tahiti to jamaica 
tahiti 
fletcher  i want you
to sail with me again 
in what capacity 
well  the admiralty s already assigned
a mr john fryer as master of the ship 
he s a good man  i think 
but i want you to be master s mate 
  if you agree  that is 
  agreed 
good  splendid  good 
why take breadfruit to jamaica 
cheap fodder for the slaves
on the plantations there 
bananas are very expensive
there these days 
it lacks glory  william 
well  i don t have your connections 
you see  fletcher 
i want to make a name for myself 
before i m too old 
and this green grocery trip
will make your name 
now look  we ll go around
cape horn to tahiti 
we ll pick up the breadfruit
then continue on
through the endeavour straits around
the cape of good hope to jamaica 
and then back to england 
we ll circumnavigate the globe 
yes  but why risk going
round the horn    what 
because it is the
quicker route  mr fryer 
quicker if we strike the
one week in a hundred
when there isn t
a storm raging 
so you would have us go the long way 
around africa and australia 
there and back 
avoid the horn altogether 
what conditions
do the plants need 
warmth  light and water 
i shall be giving up my cabin to them 
we shall be like little pigs
in a stye  shan t we 
no  sir  we shall not 
i run a healthy ship  mr fryer 
i only say
the bounty s too small 
we should have a frigate 
not a chamber pot 
yes  and i should have
promotion to captain 
but the navy board would
not heed either request  see 
quickly now  children 
ah  my little ones 
they ve come to say goodnight 
goodnight  goodnight 
off you go   
aren t you going to say goodnight to
mr christian  mr fryer    don t i get a kiss 
goodnight  young ladies 
goodnight  goodnight 
william  a toast 
to circumnavigation 
to circumnavigation 
circumnavigation 
and your safe
and speedy return 
yes 
 y i we set sail

lamb  hey  lamb 
i hope you got some lamb
in that stew 
hey  is it true
what they say about tahiti 
you mean the women 
do they really go around
with no clothes on 
all they wear is tattoos 
in wonderful places 
true 
cross my heart 
paradise 
you re in my place  quintel 
move yourself 
don t look at him 
there ll be trouble 
i said you re in my seat 
  piss off

look out  he s got a knife 
keep it quiet  churchill

churchill 
the king 
the king 
god bless him 
to the ship 
may she swim well 
the ship 
the men are very quiet 
charming tune 
and a fine musician 
we re lucky to have him 
yes  he is not there
by chance  mr nelson 
having him there
is good for morale 
dr huggen  another glass 
no  thank you  sir 
you re uncommonly
abstemious tonight 
well  more men have died
at sea from drink 
disease and dirt than
ever died by drowning 
depend upon it  gentlemen 
i m determined the bounty
shall not lose a single man 
by heavens 
i ll drink to that 
  striking a superior officer 
  no  i didn t 
  it s a hanging offence  sir 
  sorry  sir 
can t be helped  we shall all get
to know each other pretty closely 
i wonder what
we shall find out 
it depends how inquisitive
we are  mr young 
it doesn t sound quite right to me 
do you think someone
had better go and look 
good evening  mr heywood  sir 
good evening  adams 
evening  mr adams  sir 
everything alright here 
couldn t be better  sir 
my place 
stupid buggers 
you watch your
mouth too  old man 
don t old man me  churchill 
you haven t got a lucky face 
seasick  mr heywood  sir 
just leaving england 
home sick 
  feels you ll never see it again 
  don t say that  sir  it s bad luck 
sorry  never been to sea before 
two months ago i was still at school 
never been to school meself 
can t even read 
i can t steer a ship 
any fool can steer a ship  sir 
it s just knowing where to take it 
 y i 23rd december 1787 
 y i the end of our
 y i first day at sea 
tot of rum  sir 
no  thank you  no 
come on  sir  we don t cross
the equator every day 
no  thank you  no  make sure
mr heywood has some  though 
ok  that ll do 
haul him in  away 
coming up for sup 
mr heywood  sir 
here you go  sir  have some of that 
have some of that  sir 
revive the spirit as they say 
have a sup of that  go on 
get some of this
muck down you 
well done  sir 
thank you  quintel 
lieutenant bligh 
i have your log here before me 
in it  there is the frequent entry
of a single word  dancing 
can you explain that 
i can  sir 
a crew on a long voyage may easily
fall into melancholy and violence 
i believe this can be relieved
by regular exercise 
so for 20 minutes each day  i had the
crew mustered and i had them dance 
  dance 
  yes  they danced 
an activity they participated
in wholeheartedly 
i think so  yes 
and yet  mr bligh 
in your own log 
you admit that this rather
unorthodox form of exercise
led to grave discontent 
on one occasion only  sir 
and not grave 
charlie  if you only had a frock on 
i d ask you for a dance 
get your knees up  quintel 
i m doing me best  sir 
don t answer back 
we re bloody sailors 
not bloody dancers 
mr christian  mr young 
put a gag on quintel 
it wasn t bloody me 
don t make it worse  quintel 
it wasn t him  sir  it was me 
come along  mr christian 
you ve got the wrong man  sir 
churchill said it was he
who made the remark 
gag them both 
jesus christ 
  do as he says  mr christian 
  sir 
fletcher 
william  don t you think those men
have been gagged there long enough 
they were both guilty
of an act of insubordination 
i could have passed it off with
a laugh and have done less harm 
the royal navy is not a
humorous institution  sir 
and insubordination
is no laughing matter 
however  you may cut them
loose  mr christian 
but mind they appreciate
the gravity of their offence 
thank you  sir 
captain s orders 
yeah  sure 
you can close your mouth 
or i ll put it back in 
i hadn t expected this from the horn 
do you think the weather will stay with us 
perhaps 
it doesn t look much  does it 
no  no  it doesn t  sir  but i ve
seen the horn when the waves
were as high as three houses
one on top of the other 
i once saw six men washed
overboard on one wave 
someone on this ship
is very lucky 
mr fryer  close reef 
close reef  sir 
don t argue with me 
close reef 
close reef  mr cole 
stand by to close reef  all hands
on deck  move yourselves 
  hurry along and take those sails in 
  get further aloft 
hurry up    move yourselves 
get those sails in 
doesn t seem to like
fair weather  does he 
haul on that sheet 
get those sails in 
mr fryer  i seem to have
made a misjudgement 
you don t make many  sir 
make sail 
make sail  mr cole 
aye  aye  sir  prepare to make sail 
let go sheets and tack 
square away 
get aloft 
someone 
  mr christian 
  move on 
pull  pull 
robert  mind those bloody pots  robert 
robert s on fire  someone douse him 
we ll all be killed 
all hands on deck 
everyone on deck 
close the hatches 
  take the wheel  man 
  steering to port side 
the wheel  mckoy 
you all right  sir 
man those pumps 
jamie  hold that board 
someone 
don t let go on the pumps 
somebody get a bloody hammer 
sir  sir 
have the carpenter lash
those things down  now 
  we must turn back 
  what 
in my opinion 
we should put about 
in my opinion we should not  sir 
we keep on our course 
you ll never make it round the horn 
we must turn back 
mr cole  mr cole 
i want my opinion in the log  sir 
mr cole  have that lashed down 
and all the men on deck  now 
i want my opinion in the log 
very well  mr fryer  if that s
what you wish  you shall have it 
the ship can t stand it 
the ship can stand it
very well  mr fryer 
and how long do you think
the men can stand it 
as long as the officers
can stand it  mr fryer 
get these things
tied down now 
valentine 
come with me  boy 
mr bligh  how long did you
attempt to round the horn 
31 days 
and how far did you
travel in that time 
  85 miles  sir 
  85 miles in 31 days  mr bligh 
you endangered your ship
and your crew for 31 days
in order to satisfy your ambition
to circumnavigate the globe 
 y i my dearest betsy 
 y i only to you in this bitter moment
 y i can i reveal my heart 
 y i i have failed completely
 y i in my attempt to round cape horn
 y i and circumnavigate the globe 
 y i my doubts about mr fryer s
 y i commitment to our endeavour
 y i have been confirmed 
enter 
  the men are assembled  sir 
  come in  come in 
i m very sorry  william 
it can t be helped 
come along 
lads 
we will go about and run downwind
for africa and the indian ocean 
  mr lamb 
  here  sir 
as soon as we have put about it will be
safe to light your galley fires again 
tonight i want as much hot mush
as every man can eat 
let s hear it for the
captain  lads  hip hip 
hooray  hooray 
however  however  we re still
faced with a long hard voyage 
i mean to make good use
of every hour of sailing time 
and to assist me in this  i m replacing
mr fryer with mr christian
who will now act as
executive second in command
with the rank of
acting second lieutenant 
mr fryer  come back here 
mr fryer  sir  come back here 
you ll dismiss when i have done
with you  sir  do you hear me 
  this is an outrage 
  mr fryer 
in all my years at sea   
your years at sea 
good lord  man 
if i had known your nature 
i would not have accepted you
as boson of a river barge 
must i suffer this before   
you ll suffer my correction 
whenever you re at fault  sir 
what fault 
damn your eyes  man 
you turned your back on me 
  for that i apologize 
  very well 
  but i protest 
  you protest  do you 
i am master of the bounty 
and i am commander  by law 
i am the first  do you understand 
god damn your hide 
and now you may dismiss  sir 
  mr cole 
  sir 
all hands on deck 
if you please 
surely  mr bligh  it was unwise
to replace a professional sailor
like mr fryer
with a relative novice 
fletcher christian could
hardly be called a novice  sir 
the fact that he was
a good friend of yours 
was not of undue
influence upon you 
let me know the intent of
your question  mr greetham 
we re trying to establish  mr bligh 
how you came to lose your ship 
i did not lose my ship  sir 
it was taken from me by a gang of
mutineers led by fletcher christian 
the man you promoted 
yes  i promoted him because
john fryer was grossly inefficient 
and he was also a coward 
fletcher christian at least had courage 
more  perhaps  than you ultimately
found to be acceptable  mr bligh 
 y i friday  october 10th 
 y i at half past twelve today 
 y i james valentine departed this life
 y i as a result of illness and fatigue
 y i sustained at cape horn 
 y i this after all my care of the men
 y i is surely a result of our
 y i drunken surgeon s neglect 
oh  god  by whose mercy
the souls of all men rest 
bless these waters
and absolve from sin 
he whose body
we now confine to them 
eternal rest grant unto him 
and may he rest in peace  amen 
amen 
commit the body to the deep 
 y i at four o clock
 y i we buried valentine
 y i with all the decency in our power 
twenty five degrees 
thirty six minutes 
land ho  land ho 
where away 
dead ahead  sir 
stand by to fire the salute 
ready to fire the salute 
fire 
stand by for a second salute 
fire second salute 
i ll have her 
thank you 
quintel 
sorry  sir 
have you ever seen
a woman before 
keep your mind and your eyes
on your work  man 
come on  get in line there 
oars 
prepare to toss oars 
toss oars 
toss your oars 
thank you 
hail  capitan bligh 
hail  king tynah 
thank you  your majesty 
i bring you greetings from his majesty 
king george of england 
how is the great captain cook 
captain cook  he s well 
and he also sends his greetings 
  he lives 
  yes 
  he is my friend 
  i know 
now you see 
he gave me his picture 
yes 
some people say he was killed
by the people of hawaii 
no    captain cook
is very much alive 
and he s in good health  king tynah 
he s very much alive 
as i said  he sends
his greetings to you 
and he always talks of you
as his very close friend 
you told that
to this man    tynah 
king tynah  sir 
a savage king 
a king  my lord 
descended from many kings 
as our king george
is descended from many kings 
yes  in a way  sir 
then why did you lie to him 
why did you not tell him
captain cook was murdered
in hawaii 10 years before 
because they believe
that captain cook is immortal 
literally 
yes  i think so  sir  they seem to
regard his likeness as a sacred image 
interesting 
they also believe that every british
officer is more or less related to him 
so you were
more or less immortal too 
it would appear so  sir  and   
i also needed their assistance 
captain cook was our guarantor 
how long you stay in tahiti 
about two months 
round about the islands 
stay here  do not go to the other
islands  no welcome there for you 
everything you need is here 
i m much obliged to you 
his majesty king george
has sent you many gifts 
king tynah  perhaps
i could carry back in return 
gifts from yourself
to his majesty king george 
anything for a king  pigs 
bananas  coconuts  breadfruit 
breadfruit  breadfruit s
a very good idea  yes  breadfruit 
i think his majesty likes breadfruit 
isn t that true  mr nelson 
indeed it is  sir 
his majesty is a very keen gardener 
he would appreciate
breadfruit greatly 
if you were to send him
little breadfruit plants 
he could grow them
in his own garden 
we shall grow him
many little plants 
thank you 
  mr christian 
  sir 
mr cole  would you distribute the gifts
to king tynah and his good people 
these are gifts from his majesty king
george of england to yourselves 
sir 
take it away  mr cole 
oh  dear god 
  i hoped to avoid this 
  avoid what  sir 
dammit all  man 
i m expected to sleep with her 
she s one of king tynah s wives 
a gift from one chief to another as it were 
now look 
five minutes after i go below 
you must call me up on some
important business  alright 
yes  sir  what business 
business  dammit 
any bloody business 
welcome aboard  ma am 
yes 
get on with your work 
she should soften
the old man up a bit 
hot 
enter 
excuse me  sir  i   
  mr christian 
  sir 
what demands
my immediate attention 
it could wait until tomorrow 
what is it  damn you 
the ship is sinking  sir 
good 
ma am 
was fletcher christian at this time
still your friend and ally 
at that time  yes 
there was no indication
of any resentment towards you 
no  none 
mr bligh  when you
planted out your breadfruit 
did not the savages carry out
some sort of ceremony 
an indecent ceremony 
is this relevant 
captain greetham 
my lord  if the crew were
allowed to witness it  yes 
were the crew present 
mr bligh 
yes 
and was it indecent 
it is their deep belief
that the earth is rendered fruitful
by the coupling of their gods 
and that the gods can be roused
by the coupling of men and women 
so it did begin at the ceremony 
no  sir 
not at the ceremony 
no  it was fletcher christian
and the native girl 
you misunderstood the depth
of the emotion between them 
yes  i realise that now 
i had assumed that it was
simply youthful passion 
it takes more than an infatuated
youth to make a mutiny 
it takes a discontented crew 
the crew were anything
but discontented  sir 
fletcher christian corrupted them 
yes  but what made them
so easy to corrupt 
i don t know 
it was the place itself 
come here 
mr christian 
come in  whoever you are 
captain bligh s surprised
that he hasn t had the pleasure of your
company at supper for some weeks 
do you still do that 
and the captain says
he ll expect you this evening 
today   
today s not friday 
six o clock 
prompt  if you please 
wait  dr huggen 
i found the most extraordinary plant today 
on the west side of the island 
just by the mouth of the river 
mr christian 
it is half past seven 
well  you didn t
wait for me  i hope 
may i ask why you have come
to my table in a state of undress 
well  i couldn t wear the jacket 
the tattoo s too painful 
  good god 
  put on your jacket  mr christian 
it s very painful  sir 
put on your jacket  mr christian 
if you please 
  may i serve now 
  wait 
thank you  mr christian 
very well  smith 
you may serve now 
thank you  sir 
  mr nelson 
  sir 
when did you last inspect
the breadfruit plants 
yesterday  sir 
not today 
no  sir  mr christian said a daily
inspection was not necessary 
oh  did he indeed 
well  mr christian 
and when do you think they will be
ready to transport in your opinion 
they ll be some time yet  sir 
we ve already been here thirteen
weeks longer than we intended 
  will we never leave this place 
  because we arrived so late  the plants   
i want to be advised of their
progress every day  mr christian 
unless you need the time to cover
the rest of your body in pretty pictures 
wait 
the sooner we are
seamen again the better 
don t you agree  gentlemen 
now perhaps you will join me in prayer 
oh lord  our heavenly father 
almighty and everlasting god 
most humbly do we thank thee
for what we re about to receive 
it won t be long now  lads 
you ll all be on your way home 
you re not coming 
i fancy having a look at a few
of the other islands around here 
  they ll hang you for desertion 
  only if we re caught 
you with us  john 
no  i ve got a wife
and three kids back home 
there he goes 
mr bligh and bloody mighty 
how do you fancy the endeavour
straits  the indian ocean 
the south atlantic 
the north atlantic 
nothing but
rotten biscuits and pork 
and his bloody lordship on your back
morning  noon and night 
not me  lads  not me 
when do we go then 
who s officer
of the watch tonight 
i am 
yeah 
yes 
well  that s it  then 
hey  fletcher christian 
harami 
maieva 
harahai 
thank you 
you wanted to see me  sir 
my daughter   
she has something of yours 
of mine 
you are here now 
tamari 
well  i m sorry  sir  i   
take this tusk 
and when you see it  you ll remember
my daughter and my grandchild 
you will never forget tahiti nui 
fletcher christian  your wife 
  think we should go as well 
  no  i do not 
mr heywood s going to have
to answer for this  you know 
poor heywood 
hey  you bloody fools 
the hottentots out there aren t as
friendly as these ones  you know 
yeah  come on  lads 
good luck to them 
that s what i say 
they ll need it 
all hands 
thank you  mr fryer 
last night  three men of
mr heywood s watch deserted ship 
the penalty for which
is death by hanging 
mr heywood  how is it you did not
see them  were you asleep 
yes  sir 
very well  you shall kiss
the gunner s daughter 
  bosun 
  sir 
put this man over the cannon 
do it now 
aye  aye  sir 
now listen to me  all of you 
in one week s time   
stop that laughing  silence 
you think this is funny 
you re a pitiful sight  dr huggen 
go below to your quarters   
you think this is a
humorous occasion 
you are mistaken  from now on there s
going to be discipline on this ship 
we re going to have order 
and we re going to be like seamen 
in one week s time we will put to sea 
there will be no more grog 
there will be no more shore leave 
you ve become a rabble  all of you 
and you will clean up
this ship and yourselves 
  bosun 
  sir 
administer the punishment now 
capitan bligh 
mr christian 
mr christian  sir 
sir    i wish to talk
to you outside  now 
  coming  sir 
  thank you 
is there anything wrong  sir 
yes  last night while the mate
of the watch was asleep  three   
stop that noise 
three men jumped ship last night 
churchill was one of them 
you don t seem surprised 
now that it s happened  no 
no  i m not surprised 
i must say i m no longer
surprised myself
when i see the example
being set by my first officer 
just look at yourself  man 
look at the way you re dressed 
come on  you re no better
than one of these natives 
at least i am no worse 
i think your brain
has been overheated  sir 
and your body overindulged
in sexual excess 
i have done no more than
any natural man would do 
no  you have done no more
than any wild animal would do 
it always makes me laugh 
but when men lose their self restraint
they say they re natural 
they are more natural than men
who have nothing to restrain 
mr christian  you will report
to the ship before sundown 
  is that understood 
  no  no 
what did you say  you said no  is that
what you said  is that what you said  no 
alright  you will report to the ship
immediately  do you understand me 
and you will stay on ship 
there will be no more mixing with the
damned degenerate natives of these islands 
by any of my officers 
or by any of my crew 
you comprehend
my meaning  sir  good 
keep em  coming 
move it along  don t drop them 
come on  purcell  remember
that s what we re here for 
and the next one  please 
come on  keep them coming 
good lads 
alright 
where are they 
i don t know yet  sir 
we ll find them 
damn fools 
don t make it worse for yourself 
stand up 
stand up 
he can t  sir  bit of trouble
with the locals out there 
you know the penalty
for desertion  mister 
we came back
of our own accord  sir 
you re a mindless animal 
churchill 
i will decide your punishment
when you re fit to receive it 
mr cole  get dr huggen 
aye  aye  sir 
sir  over here 
  is he dead 
  yes  sir 
poor bugger 
alright  bury him 
will you organise that 
please  mr cole 
fletcher 
i ve come to say good bye 
you do not come back 
do you 
ever 
  i must go now 
  no 
not yet  soon 
eyes front  mr christian 
off hats 
take the men below 
  make sail  mr fryer 
  aye  aye  sir 
stand aside 
stand down 
stand down 
come on  lads 
no sense in this 
well  gentlemen  between ourselves
and home are 27 000 sea miles 
the endeavour straits
and the great barrier reef 
now  the crew is deeply
demoralised  gentlemen 
and i must accept 
as every captain must accept 
the inevitable and theoretical
responsibilty for that 
the actual and immediate
responsibilty  however 
i place on you 
my fellow officers 
who met this crisis with
lethargy  impudence
and flagrant defiance
publicly uttered 
and perhaps also for that 
i am to blame 
i counted on a strength of character
which you do not possess 
however  the cure for our
predicament is discipline 
and i shall apply it
with an even hand  of course 
but most
where it is most required 
yes  well  that will be all 
thank you 
you may leave now 
not you  mr christian 
leave it  now 
alright  smith  you may go
and close the door  please 
so   
you think i m harsh with you 
look  i ve been at sea many years 
fletcher  since i was twelve 
and i ve seen many men 
many good men 
lose their heads over native
women in these waters 
and i ve never yet
seen it come out well 
of course i understand
the excitement and   
but think to yourself  man 
could you take a woman like that
back home to your friends and family 
no  of course you couldn t 
they re not like us  fletcher 
you think i was harsh with you 
but you needed someone to show
you where your duty really lay 
because you were
at a loss  my friend 
you may not thank me now
but you will later 
so  let s get the ship
running properly
and get back to
where we were before 
now look  fletcher 
listen to me 
i am prepared to forgive
and i am prepared to forget 
do you understand me 
will that be all  sir 
  yes  that will be all 
  thank you 
you sent for me  sir 
yes  i did 
this ship is filthy  mr christian 
sir 
the ship is filthy  mr christian 
look for yourself 
look  filthy  sir 
filth there 
and there 
and look at there 
i understand you dismissed
the swabbing party 
you left these decks crusted
with grime  look at it there 
bloody disgrace 
now you ll be well advised  sir 
to call them back again
and this time do it properly 
do you understand me 
filth  sir  filthy  mr christian 
still filthy  look 
i see nothing  sir 
but your finger 
i ll not have your vile ways
brought aboard my ship  sir 
do you understand 
now you ll call up the
swabbing party  yet again 
and this time you ll make bloody sure
that the decks are clean 
or by god 
you ll answer for it  sir 
i ll not have any of your foul 
filthy gutter ways on board my ship 
do you understand  good god 
pigs in a sty have more comprehension
or cleanliness
than you buggers have 
now you ll get
these decks clean
or by god i ll make you
lick them clean with your tongues
if you don t mend your ways 
there is a thief among us 
yes  there is a thief on board
this ship  which is unfortunate
because you know what hardship
that means for honest men 
last night my personal store of coconuts
was well up to the top of the netting 
this morning  i    well  i mean 
look for yourselves  see 
now  if the thief will declare
himself  i will punish him alone 
and then we can
forget the matter 
sir 
hold your tongue  goddamn you  sir 
i m addressing the crew  mr christian 
who do you think you are 
now if the thief will not
declare himself   
i took one 
you 
i was thirsty  i took one of your coconuts 
i thought it of no consequence 
one coconut  mr christian 
a dozen were taken  man 
i know nothing of a dozen 
then  unless you re a liar
as well as a thief 
the rest were taken by
other members of your watch
who look to you for their
example  do they not  sir 
  mr cole 
  sir 
impound the personal stores of
every man on mr christian s watch
and put them on half rations 
  aye  aye  sir 
  thank you  stand down 
that isn t a raft 
it s a coffin 
there s a five knot current running
between here and that island 
i ll take my chance 
you think a lot of us
haven t thought of this 
you re not the only one
to have left a woman behind 
fletcher  the men are
ready for anything 
what are you saying  ned 
are you inciting me to mutiny 
if i were you 
i d take the ship  that s all 
why don t you  then 
i said if i were you  i m not 
what i have to say to you is the
result of considerable reflection 
its consequences
would be two fold 
firstly  our journey
will be shortened 
which i know is a consideration
that cannot distress you 
and secondly 
upon its successful conclusion
not one of you in later years
will look back without a surge of pride 
we shall go with the winds to jamaica
by way of cape horn 
you ll kill us all 
what did you say  adams 
we tried the horn before 
it was almost the end of us 
damn you  man 
don t you bloody cross me 
mr cole  take this man below 
and tomorrow we will assemble
to watch him receive punishment
for cowardice
and insubordination 
mr cole  take him below  sir 
you  mr fryer 
give him the makings 
sir 
now  we set out to circumnavigate
the globe  and by god we shall do it 
to the greater glory of us all 
is that understood 
thank you 
now you may dismiss 
enter 
  can i have a word with you 
  i m busy  is it important 
i think  yes 
be brief 
william  about your decision
to go around the horn 
william  not sir 
not captain  william 
i don t think the men
will have it 
oh  the men won t have it 
are they in charge of the bounty 
they might be if you insist 
again  will you repeat that  please 
the men might be in charge 
what are you
threatening me with 
it s not a threat 
it s a warning 
there are rumblings 
are there 
no  there is fear 
around the horn is the easiest way 
the better way 
and that is how we will go 
anything more 
don t put adams
under the lash 
he was insubordinate 
cowardly and insubordinate 
he frightened the men 
i did not put that fear there  he did 
so he will be lashed
and we will go around the horn

 y i how could he betray my
 y i friendship and kindness to him 
 y i i can only assume he has
 y i decided to return to a life in tahiti 
 y i after taking stock of the
 y i meagre provisions allowed us 
 y i i have decided to make
 y i for the island of tafuha
 y i in the hope of supplementing
 y i our supplies of food and water 
 y i by now  there are
 y i many natives about us 
 y i and by their manner  we do not expect
 y i our welcome to last much longer 
  mr cole 
  sir 
you take charge of my log   
and slowly   
make your way out to the launch

you give me no summer  my boys 
nasty bugger 
come on  lads

everybody in the boat 
prepare to pull away 
mr bligh    get in the boat

  bloody savages 
row for your lives  we re chops
and liver to them if they catch us 
that s the spirit 
come on  we ll do it 
we cannot risk going ashore again 
what are we going to do  sir 
well  we shall just have to try
and reach coupang 
without charts 
well  i shall have to navigate
from memory  mr fryer 
it ll take us close to the most
savage islands in these waters 
the fiji islands where cannibalism
is perfected almost to a science 
and from there  my friends 
god willing 
we shall proceed onward
to the great barrier reef itself 
then to the coast of new holland and
from there across the timor sea to coupang 
now it will take us
at least two months
and we have provisions or more
enough to last us one week 
so that is the situation  gentlemen 
plain and simple 
well  we ll just have to make
the best of it  won t we  sir 
make the best of it  smith 
yes  but will you 
that s what i ask myself 
will you make the best of it 
do you hear me  are you prepared
to make the best of it  all of you 
because all i can promise you  lads 
is relentless pain and hardship 
now  if you re prepared
to make do and make sacrifices
and furthermore
are willing to swear by it 
i promise you  our chances
of survival are fair 
you hear me 
you all say  aye 
aye 
good 
mr fryer  make way 
prepare to make way 
make way 
fletcher 
fletcher 
in the box are gifts
for the people of tahiti nui 
we did not expect you back 
we have already given you everything 
we only want our women  and perhaps
some men to help me sail the ship 
where s captain bligh 
why doesn t he come himself 
he s no longer with us 
i ve taken the ship 
he s dead 
no  no  he s not dead 
we set him adrift with some of the crew 
you shame me by coming here 
you shame me 
king george will send many ships with many
guns to punish us for what you have done 
we can give you nothing 
go now 
some of the men would like to
remain here and wait for the next ship 
they wanted to go with bligh
but there was no room in his boat 
they can stay  but not you 
take your gifts and go 
no 
should she not be allowed
to choose for herself  sir 
where will you take her 
i don t know  somewhere
the british ships won t find us 
take her  you will have
all the men you need  go now 
  goodbye  peter 
  good luck  sir

look  there s hundreds of them 
here we go  there we go    go on 
  sod it  who loaded these things 
come on  man 
quick  quick  quick    yeah 
 y i the only one i wholly trust
 y i is adams 
 y i i go everywhere
 y i with a loaded pistol 
 y i and where we are to head beyond
 y i the reach of justice  i know not 
 y i thursday  june 11th 
 y i in the afternoon we saw gannets
 y i and many other birds 
 y i and at sunset
 y i we caught one in our sail 
 y i which i reserved
 y i for our dinner next day 
who shall have this 
smith 
and who shall have this 
mr fryer 
what about the rest of us 
you just have to wait your turn 
purcell  like everyone else 
some of us haven t had
nothing in days 
that s enough  purcell 
well  it s not enough for me  sir 
i ll tell you something 
the officers and their lot
get everything 
shut your mouth  purcell 
i m as much a man
as you are  sir 
what did you say    i said
i m as much a man as you are 
are you indeed 
i m not so certain about that 
sit down  damn you 
i ll knock you on the head with it 
sit down  sit down 
mr cole  give this man
my share of food 
 y i i am committed
 y i to a desperate enterprise 
 y i i have said farewell
 y i to everything i ve been accustomed
 y i to regard as indispensable 
 y i but i suppose
 y i i have found freedom 
so you ve found freedom 
have you 
freedom  retribution 
that s what you want 
  isn t that why you gave him your compass 
  i wanted to give him a chance 
a chance to survive 
so he ll come after us again 
how can he come after us 
he ll be marooned on some island 
i only wish to god i d given
him muskets  now get out 
 y i at least ten times
 y i we have touched land 
 y i only to find either barren rocks
 y i or hostile inhabitants 
 y i and once nearly ran a foul
 y i of an english frigate 
 y i our stores are low 
 y i the spirit of the men even lower 
his royal highness
woken up at last  has he 
given you a rest 
has he  darling 
fletcher wants you 
ned  i found it 
listen 
where is it 
 july 2nd  we discovered an island 
seeming uninhabited  it was
well timbered  but we did not linger
for we could find no anchorage  
that s perfect 
every ship in the royal navy has a
copy of that book and those charts 
they never drew it
on the charts 
all they give is a latitude 
25 degrees south 
now it seems to me  all we have to do
is simply sail along this line of latitude 
we ll find the island 
somewhere 
and if we don t  these men need a
home  fletcher  they ve mutinied once 
oh  they ll have a home 
pitcairn s island 
they d better 
 y i i can no longer write
 y i for lack of strength 
 y i commend me to your parents
 y i and our loving daughters 
mr bligh 
when my spirit is gone 
there will be nothing
but flesh remaining 
i beg you  use that poor flesh
to save the others 
no  no  mr nelson 
we re civilised men  not savages 
and as civilised men we shall die 
have no fear 
sir  we d like a word 
we ve had it up to here 
there is no island 
we want to turn back to tahiti 
and who ll navigate 
you  you re the navigator 
i ll navigate 
this ship s going to
pitcairn s island 
sir 
sir 
smith 
it s land 
  what 
  i think it s land 
mr cole  you ll hoist the jack 
it s not proper to land
without identification 
oh  god 
sir  i am lieutenant william bligh 
i m a british naval officer   
and i have to report
an act of piracy 
we ve found it 
we ve found it  ned 
it s our island 
we could easily have missed it 
yes 
we ll never get off this
island now  will we  sir 
never see england again 
this court finds that the seizure of
his majesty s armed vessel  bounty 
was an act of mutiny by fletcher
christian and others of her crew 
and that her captain  lieutenant william
bligh  is in the opinion of this court 
to be exonerated
of all blame on this occasion 
indeed  in the matter of his command
of the bounty s open launch 
we commend lieutenant bligh for his
