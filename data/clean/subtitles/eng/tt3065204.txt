but this one   
this one still haunts me 
two months prior to our involvement 
the lutz family had fled their home
in the middle of the night 
claiming that the house was haunted 
the church had reached out to us for help 
they wanted to see
if we could confirm the activity
that had been reported by the lutzes 
mm hmm 
okay 
we ready 
then let s get started 
i d like you to sit quietly
and close your eyes 
envision yourself in a halo
of glowing white light 
it will protect you 
the year before
the lutzes moved in 
a young man named ronny defeo
had brutally murdered his
entire family in this house 
we d hoped to discover if the killings
had been motivated purely by anger
or if 
as ronny defeo testified in court 
he had been under the influence
of something demonic 
stay here

what did you do

ugh 
that doesn t look right 
it really works  i swear 
we already asked it all sorts of stuff 
come on  i ll show you 
all right 
what should i ask 
i don t know 
whatever you want 
okay 
my sister and i want to know   
are there any spirits here
that want to communicate with us 
is dad ever coming home 
are there any spirits here
who can answer my question 
don t worry about it 
it s just a stupid game 
it isn t real 
why re you
pounding on the door 
i m not 
you re barmy 
you know  she s pushing the boundary 
isn t it 
she says she wasn t smoking 
i don t think you should
agonize over it  peg 
god knows i had my share
of fags at school  didn t you 
oh  lots 
but it s not what she did
that bothers me 
it s that  she don t listen
to what i say anymore  pegs 
just a phase  isn t it 
i mean  i can punish her 
but then i feel guilty
because i know it s not really her fault 
she loves her dad
and she took it very hard
when he left  poor thing 
but i can t just let it go either  can i 
i m loath to ask  but have you
told richard about it 
i would  if i ever saw him 
sod 
now  it s like i m having
to do both jobs 
i m half the mum i was before 
i m just rubbish  peggy 
you are not  peggy 
you re too hard on yourself 
  ooh 
  oh 
  this sodding house 
  oh 
we are back with real
life ghost hunters 
ed and lorraine warren 
talking about their experiences
at the amityville house 
and now we re gonna talk
to my next guest 
dr  steven kaplan 
who says that the investigations
the warrens conducted
into the amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash 
why is that 
well  it s been well established
that amityville was a blatant hoax 
  but that hasn t stopped   
  that s never been proven 
yes  it has 
the lutz family made everything up
so they could profit off
of all the publicity 
that s just not true 
look  we see this all the time 
it s very easy to sit on the outside
and pick apart their story 
but it s something very different
to have been there and
experienced it for yourself 
i don t need to go to the moon
to know that it s not
made out of green cheese 
listen  ed warren s never seen a house
that he didn t think was haunted 
and by the time his wife is done
blowing smoke and ringing bells
they ve got everybody else
believing in ghosts  too 
what exactly are you a doctor of  anyway 
come on  warren 
try and show a little class  will you 
i m not gonna show class to somebody
who s sitting here telling
lies about my wife and me 
  be careful who you call a liar 
  what are you gonna do about it 
we go on these shows to inform people 
but every time i open my mouth 
another one of these little   
  ed 
  ass   
academics   
pops up 
tries to undo everything we ve done 
  could you please take a breath 
  i know  i know  i know 
i m counting to 10 
i m counting to 10

sir  that s why we re here  okay 
bring me a chair from the kitchen 
it s coming from inside the wall 
then what 
mice  maybe 
big bloody mouse 
well  there s nothing
we can do about that 
we can file an incident report
and we ll stand by it if anyone asks 
but that s about all 
a report 
oh  that s brilliant 
every problem i have 
there s another bloody form to fill out 
oh  for god s sake 
listen 
i think this is a bit beyond us 
the priest at our church
is a family friend 
i ll ask him to call on you 
   to us and tell us that   
there are still some honest
people left in the world 
and she said  what happened was 
that she was at the grocery store 
she left her wallet there 
at the grocery store 
it had money in it  a lot of money 
and she thought 
 well  that s that  it s gone  
she thought someone
was just gonna pick it up 
that s it  that s that 
but just to see what she could do 
she went back to the
grocery store and sure enough 
some honest woman had picked up the wallet
and returned it to the manager there 
she got everything back 
she got her money 
she got everything
that was in the purse 
judy 
honey   
what s wrong

  mom  mom  mom  wake up

i m okay 
mrs  hodgson 
yes 
my name s kent allen 
we re with the television
news program wide angle 
i was hoping to have
a word with you about the
disturbance
at your home last week 
how d you find out about that 
the police constables filed
an incident report  it s   
well  it s raised a few eyebrows 
i d rather not have my business
spread all over the telly 
if you don t mind 
good day 
is it still happening  because if it is
getting your side of the story out
might be your best chance
of finding help 
this thing on 
okay 
behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house
in ponders end  north london 
is a family living in a nightmare 
i look up  and through the window 
plain as day  i see the younger girl 
janet  being thrown around in the air
like she was floating 
so we run back inside and sure enough
there s little toy lego bricks
flying all around the room 
one of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood 
i saw the chair slide by itself 
across the floor 
a distance of several feet 
i checked the chair for wires 
but could find nothing to explain it 
maurice grosse is an
engineering consultant
and has been investigating these claims
for the society of psychical research 
well  i don t think there s
any doubt about it at all 
the sheer number of documented
incidents in this case
is absolutely staggering 
but  anita gregory 
a parapsychologist and lecturer
at the polytechnic of north london 
is not convinced 
our principal characters here
are all children 
and children can be
very ingenious pranksters 
at the center of these
frightening activities
is 11  year old janet hodgson 
i recently interviewed janet
and her 14 year old sister  margaret 
what happened next will astonish you 
how does it feel
living in a haunted house 
i don t know 
you don t get used to it 
you see  we was just a normal family
before all this 
it s been getting worse
since mr  grosse started talking to it 
how do you mean 
like  asking it questions 
saying knock twice for  yes 
and one for  no  
that sort of thing 
i wonder what would happen
if we tried talking to it now 
is anybody there 
is anybody there
who wishes to communicate 
i say again  is anybody there 
nothing 
well  it isn t a jukebox  is it 
janet  are you all right 
janet 
mmm 
janet 
janet  are you feeling all right 
stop calling me janet 
isn t that your name 
janet s asleep   
and i m talking

how did you die 
i went blind and had a hemorrhage 
and i fell asleep
and i died in the chair in the corner 
why have you come here

shut up  you old cow 
janet  darling 
darling  are you all right 
i m sorry 
janet

what are you talking about  darling 
  the crooked man 
  calm down and just tell me what happened 
  what 
  what is it 
i don t know 
i think he s been walking around   
thr crooked man stepped forth
and rang a crooked bell 
and thus his crooked soul
spiraled into a crooked hell 
murdered his crooked family
and laughed the crooked laugh 
janet 
janet 
janet 
oh  my god 
no 
someone get an ambulance 
this is my home 
get out now 
no  this is not your house 
now  what s your name 
knock  knock 
very well 
who s there 
bill 
bill 
bill 
bill 
bill who 
my name is bill wilkins
and i m 72 years old 
what do you make of that voice 
he sounds confused 
is he senile 
the voice on this tape
is coming from an 11  year old girl 
the family s reached out
to the church for help 
yes 
but truthfully  we ve been
reluctant to get involved 
the case has turned into
a media circus over there 
they re calling it  england s amityville  
great 
you re afraid it s a hoax 
the church s ability to help people
depends on its reputation 
so  what do you want us to do 
we d like you to fly to london
for 3 days to act as
our unofficial eyes and ears 
now  you don t have to do anything 
if it is a hoax  you just
turn around and leave 
but if it s not   
then there is a family in london
that desperately needs our help 
well  thank you for your faith in us 
  all right  well  just let me know 
  okay 
i told him we d talk about it 
there s nothing to talk about 
honey  you heard him 
they don t want us to get involved 
just observe and report back 
there have always been cases
we ve turned down 
there has never been a family
that we ve refused to help 
i had a vision in amityville 
it was the same one
i had 7 years ago 
i had a premonition of your death 
wait  that s why you locked
yourself away for 8 days 
you saw my death 
you ve seen it  too 
the demon in your painting is real 
we have both seen
the same inhuman spirit 
it s a warning 
if we keep doing this 
you are going to die 
your visions are a gift from god 
and if god is showing you my death 
then he s doing it for a reason 
maybe you re meant
to prevent it from happening 
come on 
we don t run from fights 
if we go   
if we do this   
you have to promise me
that we re just there to observe 
if anything turns out
dangerous in any way 
we re gonna tell the church 
and we re gonna get out 
promise me 
promise me  ed 
i promise 
mr  and mrs  warren 
i m maurice grosse 
thank you so much for coming 
i believe you re gonna be staying
at the hodgsons  house  is that right 
always better to be in the mix 
oh  yeah 
i agree 
you didn t have to do this 
  so kind of you 
  it was a complimentary   
this is it 
thank you very much 
  how you doing  you all right 
  i m all right  how are the kids 
yeah 
they re fine 
here we are 
there we go 
ed  we ve managed to capture
some amazing things 
i think you ll be very
impressed when you see 
great  i d like to listen
to those tapes again  too 
you ve got some really
interesting stuff in there 
vic nottingham 
hi  vic 
how are you 
ed warren 
hello  ed 
how are you 
and this is peggy  peggy hodgson 
  nice to meet you  ed warren 
  how do you do 
  this is my wife  lorraine 
  how do you do 
  hello 
  hello 
well  i ll be off then  peg 
will you tell the kids
i said hello 
yeah  of course  i will 
nice to meet you 
  nice meeting you 
  you too  hon 
  so  here we are  peggy 
  all right  do come in 
it s just me
and janet here now 
my other kids are staying with them 
this is where the girls used to sleep 
but we don t use it anymore 
why not 
well  most of the activity
centered in this room 
we were quite afraid
that someone might get hurt 
which is why we keep it locked 
i understand that janet has levitated 
did that happen in here as well 
  yeah  more than once 
  yeah 
we ve got photographs of that as well 
i d like to hear mrs  hodgson s story
from her  if you don t mind 
the neighbors donated them
and i hung them up 
hoping they d keep things
from moving around 
has it worked 
no 
we can hear it all night 
hi  there 
i m lorraine 
mind if i have a seat 
do you know why i m here 
well  your mom has told me
about what s been going on
and i m here to help 
if i can 
would you like to talk about it 
you know  when i was about your age 
um  i was visiting my mom at a hospital
and i saw an angel 
yeah 
it was standing next to
a little boy s bed 
it was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped 
and it looked right at me 
of course  my mom and the nurses
did not believe me 
but i knew it was real 
look  i know how it is 
i know what it s like to lose your friends
because you re different 
but i also know that
one person can change everything 
and you just have to open up to them 
how did you know you could trust
the people you opened up to 
i didn t 
sometimes i got hurt 
and it took a long time  but   
i finally found someone
who believed me 
what did you do then 
i married him 
i m just so tired 
i can t sleep here 
i used to go to the medical room at school
and they let me sleep there
because i was so worn out 
but now i can t even do that 
everyone s afraid of me 
i got no friends 
no place i can go to 
it makes me feel like
i m not normal 
you know  whatever is doing this to you
wants you to feel this way 
but why 
because that s what makes it stronger 
around the time this all started 
janet started waking up here
in the middle of the night 
this is the spot that janet said
bill wilkins died  right here 
where d you get it from 
uh   
my ex husband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in 
if you don t mind me asking   
uh  is your ex husband
still in the picture 
nope 
i m sorry to hear that 
any chance of reconciliation 
he had twins with a woman
from round the corner 
so i m gonna
take that as a  no  
  yeah  it s been a lot to deal with 
  hmm 
he took all the music
the day he left 
i know it must feel like
that sometimes   
no  i mean  literally 
he took all the records 
my kids used to love listening
to his elvis collection 
  they ve been through so much 
  hmm 
and now  all this is happening on top 
yeah 
the timing isn t a coincidence 
negative entities often
feed off emotional distress 
they like to kick you
when you re down 
that hardly seems fair 
no  it really isn t 
do you know when
the voice is gonna speak 
sometimes 
and when it does  does it feel
like it s coming from inside you 
no 
more like it s coming from behind me 
like i m being used 
does it ever say things just to you 
that only you can hear 
what does it say 
it said it wants to hurt you 
when did it say that 
right now 
do we really need that 
oh  we d like to be
able to prove to the church
that she s not making
the voice herself 
so  by holding the water in her mouth 
we ll be able to show that
it s not some form of ventriloquism 
does she have to be in the chair 
just   
it makes me sick to see
her sitting there like that 
we know it s hard  but the spirit
has shown an attachment to this spot 
it ll be easier for ed to contact it
if she s sitting there 
you ll be all right 
you ready for this 
i guess so 
it s december the 21 st  1977 
this is ed and lorraine warren 
sitting with peggy and janet hodgson 
also present is maurice grosse 
all right 
let s get started 
if there s something here that would
like to communicate with us 
we re all ears 
speak up 
what do you want
with this girl and her family 
it says it won t talk with you
all looking at me like this 
strange 
i wonder why not 
it s not been shy about
talking up until now 
how about if we all turn our backs 
think it ll speak if we do that 
maybe 
well   
let s try this again 
so what do you think  bill 
we ve given you your privacy 
now come on out
and talk to us 
here i come 
am i talking to the spirit
that s oppressing this family 
is that what i am 
is that what i m doing 
yes 
and i have come to put a stop to it 
do you know who i am 
ed 
eddie 
edward 
ed is fine 
your father called you edward 
not true 
my father called me ed 
just like everybody else 
come on  bill 
you re not a psychiatrist
and i m not here to talk
about my father 
let s get down to business 
what do you say 
hmm 
why don t you
just leave these people alone 
because this is my house 
it s not your house 
yes  it is 
i come here to see my family 
but they re not here now 
that s because you re dead 
if your family did live here 
they re long gone now 
where are they 
i don t know 
if i did  maybe i could help you 
i don t need your help 
then why don t you just move on 
i don t believe in that 
why not  hmm 
what would be so wrong
with going to heaven 
i    am not
a heaven man 
well  i got news for you  bill 
you see  i don t care what you believe in 
you see this 
help    it    let    go 
help    it    let    go 
are you sensing a presence 
no  just the opposite 
i m not sensing anything 
we could be looking
at hysterical neurosis 
that would explain
the multiple personalities
and hallucinations 
that doesn t feel right  either 
well   
i can t explain it 
my heart is telling me to believe them 
i heard that voice
with my own ears 
but all i can sense
is their own fear 
i can t seem to see beyond that 
i don t think i can sleep
this far away from you 
well  you re gonna 
it ll give you something
to look forward to when we get home 
oh  love 
i wish you wouldn t do that 
it helps me sleep 
at least i know
i m not going anywhere 
i didn t smoke  mum 
eh 
that day with camilla at school 
i was holding the cigarette 
but i wasn t going to take
a puff  i swear 
i just wanted to look cool
in front of her 
it was stupid 
oh  love 
i m sorry i didn t believe you 
oh  darling 
help 
help 
hmm 
janet 
ah 
janet 
oh  my god 
janet 
janet 
  help 
  janet 
janet 
please help me 
mum 
please 
mum 
  janet 
  help  get me out 
there s somebody in here 
i can t open it 
  mum  help me 
  it won t open 
janet 
janet 
  what s going on 
  there s someone in there with janet 
i can t get it open 
get the key 
go get the key now 
janet  hold on 
we re coming 
i got the key 
i got the key 
okay  okay 
come on 
janet  we re coming 
  janet 
  janet darling 
get it off her 
please get it off her 
what was that 
there was someone in here 
i saw him with me own eyes 
he did this to my girl 
this is the bite wound
janet received the first night 
it s faded a bit here 
but you can still make it out 
wow 
that s pretty distinctive 
two missing teeth 
that s right  and it s too big
for one of the children 
you think this was the spirit 
this bill wilkins 
i tracked down the home owner 
and it turns out 
the owner s father lived there 
his name was william wilkins
and he died of a hemorrhage
in the brain in that chair 
everything she said is true 
all public information  by the way 
she could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor 
and what about the claims
that janet has been
teleporting around the
house in her sleep 
about as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed 
were any of you there
when it happened 
no 
but i have pictures of that too 
yeah  there you go 
i set my camera up
in the girls  room
and then waited downstairs
with the remote control 
and fired it off whenever
i heard any commotion 
i have to admit 
the way her knees are bent 
the upright position of her body 
it looks like she s just jumping 
what are you saying 
i mean  you were there last night 
you saw it with your own eyes 
well  peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking janet 
but she teleported herself into a room
locked from the outside 
for goodness  sake 
and what about her voice 
how do we explain that 
i think the first time
she was making that voice
it was in front of television cameras 
and she couldn t do it
with water in her mouth
until you looked away 
so she could have spit it out 
taken another sip
before you turned back 
last year  i was conned by a welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons 
honestly 
i don t know what was worse 
the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them 
the demons are worse 
but you must admit 
it is suspicious 
you sincerely believe
that she s faking everything 
and what about peggy 
she s just using the whole
thing as an excuse
to get better housing from the council 
she s already applied 
look  i m not saying it s a hoax 
sometimes  what we do
requires a leap of faith 
to believe when nobody else will 
so you really do believe them 
yes 
we do 
but the church can t do
anything without proof 
that s what we need 
right  listen  i ll make
some telephone calls 
see if i can get hold of some
video recording equipment 
in the meantime 
ed and i can be spending time
with peggy and the kids 
because they need to be a family again 
hi  mom 
we re back 
what are you doing back 
what s all this  then 
mr  and mrs  warren
bought us some vinyls 
they got us an elvis record 
oh  blue hawaii 
hope you don t mind 
a little american culture 
not at all 
  janet 
  billy 
i missed you 
hey  guys  i missed you 
so  have any of you ever been
bothered by a bully 
pete  at school 
he s always picking on billy 
and  dear  tell me  what do
you do when that happens 
they stick up for me 
good  because the spirit in this house
  is a lot like that bully 
  yes 
and he s got it in for janet 
so you guys gotta stick up for her 
the same way they stick up for you 
family sticks together 
this  on the other hand 
is a lost cause 
oh  bloody hell 
we ve had all sorts of things stop working
  for no reason at all 
  mmm 
we re gonna have music in here
one way or another 
whose guitar is that 
oh  it was dad s 
but he said i could have it 
yeah  do you mind 
no 
i m a little rusty 
so you gotta promise not to laugh 
especially you 
wise men say
only fools rush in
thank you 
hey  don t laugh now 
but i can t help
falling in love with you
shall i stay 
would it be a sin 
if i can t help
falling in love with you
like a river flows
surely to the sea
darling  so it goes
some things are meant to be
everybody now 
take my hand 
take my whole life  too
for i can t help
falling in love with you
for i can t help
falling in love with you
thank you very much 
it s so small and light 
why do you do this 
help people like us 
when you were little  did you ever
worry that there might be something
hiding under your bed at night 
yeah 
well   
my bed 
actually had something under it 
yeah 
something grabbed my hand
and yanked me right to the floor 
it was too dark to see under there 
but let me tell you 
i ran out of there so fast 
you know what my dad did 
he dragged me right back into the room
and told me i had to face my fears 
and i was scared to death 
but then i remembered
what this nun had told me in catechism 
 god will be there for all who need  
so  i grabbed this crucifix
out from my nightstand  right 
and i tell whatever s under there
that it better leave 
or god was gonna kick its butt 
best thing my dad
ever did for me 
of course he only did it
because he really didn t believe me 
it took me years
to finally find someone who did 
and you know what i did then 
you married her 
so you ve heard this story before 
all right 
how you getting on in here 
hey 
we re done here 
fixed the closet door  too 
and if you d like  i could take a look
at the washing machine 
oh 
no  i couldn t ask you to do that 
it s a disaster down there 
come on 
how bad can it be 
oh 
bloody hell 
everything still quiet in there 
yes  thank goodness 
yes 
it would be something though  wouldn t it 
if we were able to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt
that there is a life
beyond this 
it would be historic 
is that why you re doing this 
because you want to be a part
of something historic 
this isn t a laboratory 
this is someone s house 
and i think helping that family
is the only thing that matters 
no  i m sorry 
i didn t mean that 
my daughter died in a car
crash several years ago 
afterwards  i started
to experience things 
i think she wanted to
communicate with me 
and  yes  it would help
if i knew that she was   
i don t know 
somewhere 
that s not it 
oh  great 
i think i found it 
all right 
it s right here 
come and get it 
margaret 
johnny  come and get it 
okay 
i think i got it 
all right 
there we go 
what s that

it was him 
he tried to pull me under 
oh  my god

janet 
it s okay  it s okay 
come on  come on 
come on  now 
it s okay 
watch out  look out 
  slowly 
  okay 
darling  it s all right 
it s all right  mum s here 
mum s here  darling 
how did she get in there 
it s all right  darling 
what s that 
it s fine 
can i  uh   
what is it 
she s faking it 
what 
i have proof 
so much for your leap of faith 
what 
my girl didn t make this up 
i ve seen things 
she was caught red handed faking an event 
no  it s not possible 
have you seen it in there 
how could a 12 year old girl
throw a table across the room 
it s over 
do you understand 
for the sake of your daughter 
don t make this harder than it already is 
she couldn t have pulled this off alone 
oh  how dare you 
what  you think i put her up to this 
what about the police 
are they in on this  too 
no  it s all right 
what about you two 
you believe us  don t you 
we wanna help 
but the church take one look at
that video and that ll be the end of it 
they ll wanna distance themselves from
anything that remotely resembles a hoax 
i d like you to leave  please 
now  go on  get out 
get out  the lot of you 
get out 
perhaps  you could somehow
reach out to the spirit 
you know  make contact with it yourself 
i can t 
believe me  i ve tried 
i m sorry  i m just not
sensing anything here 
so  that s it  then 
you hold out a lifeline to them
and then you just throw it away 
we don t like this
any more than you do 
we ll tell the church
about everything we ve seen 
but  the only piece
of concrete evidence we ve got 
is a video of janet faking an incident 
yeah  but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents 
you might want this 
and  just because she faked it this once 
doesn t change the fact that   
no  it changes everything 
we re agents of the church here 
they d be calling us home
even if peggy hadn t asked us to leave 
you ve done really
good work here  maurice 
you were here for them
when no one else was 
uh  thank you 
but  sometimes you need to
make a leap of faith 
believe when nobody else will 
this doesn t feel right 
i know 
have a safe trip 
did you really do it 
wreck the kitchen and all that 
but  why 
it said it would kill you 
if i didn t make them leave 
don t you think
it s a little convenient
that she just happened
to fake an incident
in the one room of the house
that had a video camera pointing at it 
yeah 
no 
oh  damn it 
lorraine 
help me set up these tape recorders 
thread it through
and start it from the top 
all right 
remember those strange 
garbled messages we got from janet 
  you know  from bill 
  yes 
there were two of them  right 
here s the first one 
help 
it   
let go 
help 
it    let   
go 
we thought
he was referring to himself  right 
  yes 
  listen to the second one 
me    won t   
me    won t   
me   
if i m right about this   
help me 
it won t let me go 
help me 
it won t let me go 
i come here to see my family 
but they re not here now 
i think 
i d like to go now 
  but i can t 
  why not 
it wants her 
so badly 
it almost has her 
tell me how to stop it 
i m given and i m taken 
i was there at your first breath 
you didn t ask for me 
but i ll follow you till death 
wait 
i don t understand 
i   
please    i   
oh  god 
you re bleeding 
what is happening 
the old man s spirit is just a pawn 
he s been enslaved
to where he s to weaken janet s will 
enslaved 
enslaved by who 
something inhuman 
something that s taken
a blasphemous form to attack my faith 
there is a demonic presence
in that house 
you need to get vic before he leaves 
we need to go back 
okay 
mom  help me  please 
mom 
please  mom  help me 
help 
ha ha ha   
for god s sake 
leave us alone 
margaret 
margaret  no 
no 
come on  let s get out of here 
come on  let s get out 
  go to peggy s house 
  what  you re not coming 
i can t leave janet 
  no  janet 
  mum 
janet 
well  i don t understand it 
i mean  first you say it s not real 
now it is 
her sight was being blocked
by the inhuman spirit 
the old man s spirit
couldn t break through
until we left that house 
everything they ve experienced
has been a manifestation of the demonic 
the old man  the crooked man 
they re just a facade 
trying to keep us from seeing
the real evil in that house 
in my vision  he wanted to help me 
but he was too afraid 
and he kept speaking
in a kind of riddle 
something like  uh 
 i am given and i am taken 
 i was there at your first breath 
 you didn t ask for me 
 but i will follow you until your death  
your name  you didn t ask for it 
it was given  when you were born 
that s it 
knowing the demon s name
gives us power over it
and we can cast it out 
yeah  sure 
but we don t know its name 
but  maybe we do 
huh 
why else would he give us that clue 
he must think that
we know it somehow 
so  what do you do now 
an inhuman spirit powerful enough
to cloud lorraine s sight
is more than a match for me 
we need to get janet to the church
before it kills her 
janet 
  what happened 
  margaret 
janet 
janet
