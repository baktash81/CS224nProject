but this one
this one still haunts me
two months prior to our involvement
the lutz family had fled their home
in the middle of the night
claiming that the house was haunted
the church had reached out to us for help
they wanted to see
if we could confirm the activity
that had been reported by the lutzes
mmhmm
okay
we ready
then lets get started
id like you to sit quietly
and close your eyes
envision yourself in a halo
of glowing white light
it will protect you
the year before
the lutzes moved in
a young man named ronny defeo
had brutally murdered his
entire family in this house
wed hoped to discover if the killings
had been motivated purely by anger
or if
as ronny defeo testified in court
he had been under the influence
of something demonic
stay here

you know shes pushing the boundary
isnt it
she says she wasnt smoking
i dont think you should
agonize over it peg
god knows i had my share
of fags at school didnt you
oh lots
but its not what she did
that bothers me
its that she dont listen
to what i say anymore pegs
just a phase isnt it
i mean i can punish her
but then i feel guilty
because i know its not really her fault
she loves her dad
and she took it very hard
when he left poor thing
but i cant just let it go either can i
im loath to ask but have you
told richard about it
i would if i ever saw him
sod
now its like im having
to do both jobs

im just rubbish peggy
you are not peggy
youre too hard on yourself
ooh
oh
this sodding house
oh
we are back with real
life ghost hunters
ed and lorraine warren
talking about their experiences
at the amityville house
and now were gonna talk
to my next guest
dr steven kaplan
who says that the investigations
the warrens conducted
into the amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash
why is that
well its been well established
that amityville was a blatant hoax
but that hasnt stopped
thats never been proven
yes it has
the lutz family made everything up
so they could profit off
of all the publicity
thats just not true
look we see this all the time
its very easy to sit on the outside
and pick apart their story
but its something very different
to have been there and
experienced it for yourself
i dont need to go to the moon
to know that its not
made out of green cheese
listen ed warrens never seen a house
that he didnt think was haunted
and by the time his wife is done
blowing smoke and ringing bells
theyve got everybody else
believing in ghosts too
what exactly are you a doctor of anyway
come on warren
try and show a little class will you
im not gonna show class to somebody
whos sitting here telling
lies about my wife and me
be careful who you call a liar
what are you gonna do about it
we go on these shows to inform people
but every time i open my mouth
another one of these little
ed
ass
academics
pops up
tries to undo everything weve done
could you please take a breath
i know i know i know
im counting to 10
im counting to 10

we can file an incident report
and well stand by it if anyone asks
but thats about all
a report
oh thats brilliant
every problem i have
theres another bloody form to fill out
oh for gods sake
listen
i think this is a bit beyond us
the priest at our church
is a family friend
ill ask him to call on you
to us and tell us that
there are still some honest
people left in the world
and she said what happened was
that she was at the grocery store
she left her wallet there
at the grocery store
it had money in it a lot of money
and she thought
well thats that its gone
she thought someone
was just gonna pick it up
thats it thats that
but just to see what she could do
she went back to the
grocery store and sure enough
some honest woman had picked up the wallet
and returned it to the manager there
she got everything back
she got her money
she got everything
that was in the purse
judy
honey
whats wrong
mom
whos that
go back
who are you
tell me who you are
mom mom mom wake up
no
what do you want
im sorry lorraine
are you okay
im okay
mrs hodgson
yes
my names kent allen
were with the television
news program wide angle
i was hoping to have
a word with you about the
disturbance
at your home last week
howd you find out about that
the police constables filed
an incident report its
well its raised a few eyebrows
id rather not have my business
spread all over the telly
if you dont mind
good day
is it still happening because if it is
getting your side of the story out
might be your best chance
of finding help
this thing on
okay
behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house
in ponders end north london
is a family living in a nightmare
i look up and through the window
plain as day i see the younger girl
janet being thrown around in the air
like she was floating
so we run back inside and sure enough
theres little toy lego bricks
flying all around the room
one of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood
i saw the chair slide by itself
across the floor
a distance of several feet
i checked the chair for wires
but could find nothing to explain it
maurice grosse is an
engineering consultant
and has been investigating these claims
for the society of psychical research
well i dont think theres
any doubt about it at all
the sheer number of documented
incidents in this case
is absolutely staggering
but anita gregory
a parapsychologist and lecturer
at the polytechnic of north london
is not convinced
our principal characters here
are all children
and children can be
very ingenious pranksters
at the center of these
frightening activities
is 11 yearold janet hodgson
i recently interviewed janet
and her 14yearold sister margaret
what happened next will astonish you
how does it feel
living in a haunted house
i dont know
you dont get used to it
you see we was just a normal family
before all this
its been getting worse
since mr grosse started talking to it
how do you mean
like asking it questions
saying knock twice for yes
and one for no
that sort of thing
i wonder what would happen
if we tried talking to it now
is anybody there
is anybody there
who wishes to communicate
i say again is anybody there
nothing
well it isnt a jukebox is it
janet are you all right
janet
mmm
janet
janet are you feeling all right
stop calling me janet
isnt that your name
janets asleep
and im talking
well what should i call you
what is your name

my name is bill wilkins
and im 72 years old
where do you come from
i come from the grave
how did you die
i went blind and had a hemorrhage
and i fell asleep
and i died in the chair in the corner
why have you come here
i like to hear them scream
why dont you just leave us alone
shut up you old cow
janet darling
darling are you all right

bbbaron

mum

what crooked what
what are you talking about darling
the crooked man
calm down and just tell me what happened
what
what is it
i dont know
i think hes been walking around
thr crooked man stepped forth
and rang a crooked bell
and thus his crooked soul
spiraled into a crooked hell
murdered his crooked family
and laughed the crooked laugh
janet
janet
janet
oh my god
no
someone get an ambulance
this is my home
get out now
no this is not your house
now whats your name
knock knock
very well
whos there
bill
bill
bill
bill
bill who
my name is bill wilkins
and im 72 years old
what do you make of that voice
he sounds confused
is he senile
the voice on this tape
is coming from an 11 yearold girl
the familys reached out
to the church for help
yes
but truthfully weve been
reluctant to get involved
the case has turned into
a media circus over there
theyre calling it englands amityville
great
youre afraid its a hoax
the churchs ability to help people
depends on its reputation
so what do you want us to do
wed like you to fly to london
for 3 days to act as
our unofficial eyes and ears
now you dont have to do anything
if it is a hoax you just
turn around and leave
but if its not
then there is a family in london
that desperately needs our help
well thank you for your faith in us
all right well just let me know
okay
i told him wed talk about it
theres nothing to talk about
honey you heard him
they dont want us to get involved
just observe and report back
there have always been cases
weve turned down
there has never been a family
that weve refused to help
i had a vision in amityville
it was the same one
i had 7 years ago
i had a premonition of your death
wait thats why you locked
yourself away for 8 days
you saw my death
youve seen it too
the demon in your painting is real
we have both seen
the same inhuman spirit
its a warning
if we keep doing this
you are going to die
your visions are a gift from god
and if god is showing you my death
then hes doing it for a reason
maybe youre meant
to prevent it from happening
come on
we dont run from fights
if we go
if we do this
you have to promise me
that were just there to observe
if anything turns out
dangerous in any way
were gonna tell the church
and were gonna get out
promise me
promise me ed
i promise
mr and mrs warren
im maurice grosse
thank you so much for coming
i believe youre gonna be staying
at the hodgsons house is that right
always better to be in the mix
oh yeah
i agree
you didnt have to do this
so kind of you
it was a complimentary
this is it
thank you very much
how you doing you all right
im all right how are the kids
yeah
theyre fine
here we are
there we go
ed weve managed to capture
some amazing things
i think youll be very
impressed when you see
great id like to listen
to those tapes again too
youve got some really
interesting stuff in there
vic nottingham
hi vic
how are you
ed warren
hello ed
how are you
and this is peggy peggy hodgson
nice to meet you ed warren
how do you do
this is my wife lorraine
how do you do
hello
hello
well ill be off then peg
will you tell the kids
i said hello
yeah of course i will
nice to meet you
nice meeting you
you too hon
so here we are peggy
all right do come in
its just me
and janet here now
my other kids are staying with them
this is where the girls used to sleep
but we dont use it anymore
why not
well most of the activity
centered in this room
we were quite afraid
that someone might get hurt
which is why we keep it locked
i understand that janet has levitated
did that happen in here as well
yeah more than once
yeah
weve got photographs of that as well
id like to hear mrs hodgsons story
from her if you dont mind
the neighbors donated them
and i hung them up
hoping theyd keep things
from moving around
has it worked
no
we can hear it all night
hi there
im lorraine
mind if i have a seat
do you know why im here
well your mom has told me
about whats been going on
and im here to help
if i can
would you like to talk about it
you know when i was about your age
um i was visiting my mom at a hospital
and i saw an angel
yeah
it was standing next to
a little boys bed
it was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped
and it looked right at me
of course my mom and the nurses
did not believe me
but i knew it was real
look i know how it is
i know what its like to lose your friends
because youre different
but i also know that
one person can change everything
and you just have to open up to them
how did you know you could trust
the people you opened up to
i didnt
sometimes i got hurt
and it took a long time but
i finally found someone
who believed me
what did you do then
i married him
im just so tired
i cant sleep here
i used to go to the medical room at school
and they let me sleep there
because i was so worn out
but now i cant even do that
everyones afraid of me
i got no friends
no place i can go to
it makes me feel like
im not normal
you know whatever is doing this to you
wants you to feel this way
but why
because thats what makes it stronger
around the time this all started
janet started waking up here
in the middle of the night
this is the spot that janet said
bill wilkins died right here
whered you get it from
uh
my exhusband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in
if you dont mind me asking
uh is your exhusband
still in the picture
nope
im sorry to hear that
any chance of reconciliation
he had twins with a woman
from round the corner
so im gonna
take that as a no
yeah its been a lot to deal with
hmm
he took all the music
the day he left
i know it must feel like
that sometimes
no i mean literally
he took all the records
my kids used to love listening
to his elvis collection
theyve been through so much
hmm
and now all this is happening on top
yeah
the timing isnt a coincidence
negative entities often
feed off emotional distress
they like to kick you
when youre down
that hardly seems fair
no it really isnt
do you know when
the voice is gonna speak
sometimes
and when it does does it feel
like its coming from inside you
no
more like its coming from behind me
like im being used
does it ever say things just to you
that only you can hear
what does it say
it said it wants to hurt you
when did it say that
right now
do we really need that
oh wed like to be
able to prove to the church
that shes not making
the voice herself
so by holding the water in her mouth
well be able to show that
its not some form of ventriloquism
does she have to be in the chair
just
it makes me sick to see
her sitting there like that
we know its hard but the spirit
has shown an attachment to this spot
itll be easier for ed to contact it
if shes sitting there
youll be all right
you ready for this
i guess so
its december the 21 st 1977
this is ed and lorraine warren
sitting with peggy and janet hodgson
also present is maurice grosse
all right
lets get started
if theres something here that would
like to communicate with us
were all ears
speak up
what do you want
with this girl and her family
it says it wont talk with you
all looking at me like this
strange
i wonder why not
its not been shy about
talking up until now
how about if we all turn our backs
think itll speak if we do that
maybe
well
lets try this again
so what do you think bill
weve given you your privacy
now come on out
and talk to us
here i come
am i talking to the spirit
thats oppressing this family
is that what i am
is that what im doing
yes
and i have come to put a stop to it
do you know who i am
ed
eddie
edward
ed is fine
your father called you edward
not true
my father called me ed
just like everybody else
come on bill
youre not a psychiatrist
and im not here to talk
about my father
lets get down to business
what do you say
hmm
why dont you
just leave these people alone
because this is my house
its not your house
yes it is
i come here to see my family
but theyre not here now
thats because youre dead
if your family did live here
theyre long gone now
where are they
i dont know
if i did maybe i could help you
i dont need your help
then why dont you just move on
i dont believe in that
why not hmm
what would be so wrong
with going to heaven
i am not
a heaven man
well i got news for you bill
you see i dont care what you believe in
you see this
help it let go
help it let go
are you sensing a presence
no just the opposite
im not sensing anything
we could be looking
at hysterical neurosis
that would explain
the multiple personalities
and hallucinations
that doesnt feel right either
well
i cant explain it
my heart is telling me to believe them
i heard that voice
with my own ears
but all i can sense
is their own fear
i cant seem to see beyond that
i dont think i can sleep
this far away from you
well youre gonna
itll give you something
to look forward to when we get home
oh love
i wish you wouldnt do that
it helps me sleep
at least i know
im not going anywhere
i didnt smoke mum
eh
that day with camilla at school
i was holding the cigarette
but i wasnt going to take
a puff i swear
i just wanted to look cool
in front of her
it was stupid
oh love
im sorry i didnt believe you
oh darling
help
help
hmm
janet
ah
janet
oh my god
janet
janet
help
janet
janet
please help me
mum
please
mum
janet
help get me out
theres somebody in here
i cant open it
mum help me
it wont open
janet
janet
whats going on
theres someone in there with janet
i cant get it open
get the key
go get the key now
janet hold on
were coming
i got the key
i got the key
okay okay
come on
janet were coming
janet
janet darling
get it off her
please get it off her
what was that
there was someone in here
i saw him with me own eyes
he did this to my girl
this is the bite wound
janet received the first night
its faded a bit here
but you can still make it out
wow
thats pretty distinctive
two missing teeth
thats right and its too big
for one of the children
you think this was the spirit
this bill wilkins
i tracked down the home owner
and it turns out
the owners father lived there
his name was william wilkins
and he died of a hemorrhage
in the brain in that chair
everything she said is true
all public information by the way
she could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor
and what about the claims
that janet has been
teleporting around the
house in her sleep
about as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed
were any of you there
when it happened
no
but i have pictures of that too
yeah there you go
i set my camera up
in the girls room
and then waited downstairs
with the remote control
and fired it off whenever
i heard any commotion
i have to admit
the way her knees are bent
the upright position of her body
it looks like shes just jumping
what are you saying
i mean you were there last night
you saw it with your own eyes
well peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking janet
but she teleported herself into a room
locked from the outside
for goodness sake
and what about her voice
how do we explain that
i think the first time
she was making that voice
it was in front of television cameras
and she couldnt do it
with water in her mouth
until you looked away
so she could have spit it out
taken another sip
before you turned back
last year i was conned by a welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons
honestly
i dont know what was worse
the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them
the demons are worse
but you must admit
it is suspicious
you sincerely believe
that shes faking everything
and what about peggy
shes just using the whole
thing as an excuse
to get better housing from the council
shes already applied
look im not saying its a hoax
sometimes what we do
requires a leap of faith
to believe when nobody else will
so you really do believe them
yes
we do
but the church cant do
anything without proof
thats what we need
right listen ill make
some telephone calls
see if i can get hold of some
video recording equipment
in the meantime
ed and i can be spending time
with peggy and the kids
because they need to be a family again
hi mom
were back
what are you doing back
whats all this then
mr and mrs warren
bought us some vinyls
they got us an elvis record
oh blue hawaii
hope you dont mind
a little american culture
not at all
janet
billy
i missed you
hey guys i missed you
so have any of you ever been
bothered by a bully
pete at school
hes always picking on billy
and dear tell me what do
you do when that happens
they stick up for me
good because the spirit in this house
is a lot like that bully
yes
and hes got it in for janet
so you guys gotta stick up for her
the same way they stick up for you
family sticks together
this on the other hand
is a lost cause
oh bloody hell
weve had all sorts of things stop working
for no reason at all
mmm
were gonna have music in here
one way or another
whose guitar is that
oh it was dads
but he said i could have it
yeah do you mind
no
im a little rusty
so you gotta promise not to laugh
especially you
wise men say
only fools rush in
thank you
hey dont laugh now
but i cant help
falling in love with you
shall i stay
would it be a sin
if i cant help
falling in love with you
like a river flows
surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be
everybody now
take my hand
take my whole life too
for i cant help
falling in love with you
for i cant help
falling in love with you
thank you very much
its so small and light
why do you do this
help people like us
when you were little did you ever
worry that there might be something
hiding under your bed at night
yeah
well
my bed
actually had something under it
yeah
something grabbed my hand
and yanked me right to the floor
it was too dark to see under there
but let me tell you
i ran out of there so fast
you know what my dad did
he dragged me right back into the room
and told me i had to face my fears
and i was scared to death
but then i remembered
what this nun had told me in catechism
god will be there for all who need
so i grabbed this crucifix
out from my nightstand right
and i tell whatevers under there
that it better leave
or god was gonna kick its butt
best thing my dad
ever did for me
of course he only did it
because he really didnt believe me
it took me years
to finally find someone who did
and you know what i did then
you married her
so youve heard this story before
all right
how you getting on in here
hey
were done here
fixed the closet door too
and if youd like i could take a look
at the washing machine
oh
no i couldnt ask you to do that
its a disaster down there
come on
how bad can it be
oh
bloody hell
everything still quiet in there
yes thank goodness
yes
it would be something though wouldnt it
if we were able to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt
that there is a life
beyond this
it would be historic
is that why youre doing this
because you want to be a part
of something historic
this isnt a laboratory
this is someones house
and i think helping that family
is the only thing that matters
no im sorry
i didnt mean that
my daughter died in a car
crash several years ago
afterwards i started
to experience things
i think she wanted to
communicate with me
and yes it would help
if i knew that she was
i dont know
somewhere
thats not it
oh great
i think i found it
all right
its right here
come and get it
margaret
johnny come and get it

darling its all right
its all right mums here
mums here darling
how did she get in there
its all right darling
whats that
its fine
can i uh
what is it
shes faking it
what
i have proof
so much for your leap of faith
what
my girl didnt make this up
ive seen things
she was caught redhanded faking an event
no its not possible
have you seen it in there
how could a 12yearold girl
throw a table across the room
its over
do you understand
for the sake of your daughter
dont make this harder than it already is
she couldnt have pulled this off alone
oh how dare you
what you think i put her up to this
what about the police
are they in on this too
no its all right
what about you two
you believe us dont you
we wanna help
but the church take one look at
that video and thatll be the end of it
theyll wanna distance themselves from
anything that remotely resembles a hoax
id like you to leave please
now go on get out
get out the lot of you
get out
perhaps you could somehow
reach out to the spirit
you know make contact with it yourself
i cant
believe me ive tried
im sorry im just not
sensing anything here
so thats it then
you hold out a lifeline to them
and then you just throw it away
we dont like this
any more than you do
well tell the church
about everything weve seen
but the only piece
of concrete evidence weve got
is a video of janet faking an incident
yeah but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents
you might want this
and just because she faked it this once
doesnt change the fact that
no it changes everything
were agents of the church here
theyd be calling us home
even if peggy hadnt asked us to leave
youve done really
good work here maurice
you were here for them
when no one else was
uh thank you
but sometimes you need to
make a leap of faith
believe when nobody else will
this doesnt feel right
i know
have a safe trip
did you really do it
wreck the kitchen and all that
but why
it said it would kill you
if i didnt make them leave
dont you think
its a little convenient
that she just happened
to fake an incident
in the one room of the house
that had a video camera pointing at it
yeah
no
oh damn it
lorraine
help me set up these tape recorders
thread it through
and start it from the top
all right
remember those strange
garbled messages we got from janet
you know from bill
yes
there were two of them right
heres the first one
help
it
let go
help
it let
go
we thought
he was referring to himself right
yes
listen to the second one
me wont
me wont
me
if im right about this
help me
it wont let me go
help me
it wont let me go
i come here to see my family
but theyre not here now
i think
id like to go now
but i cant
why not
it wants her
so badly
it almost has her
tell me how to stop it
im given and im taken
i was there at your first breath
you didnt ask for me
but ill follow you till death
wait
i dont understand
i
please i
oh god
youre bleeding
what is happening
the old mans spirit is just a pawn
hes been enslaved
to where hes to weaken janets will
enslaved
enslaved by who
something inhuman
something thats taken
a blasphemous form to attack my faith
there is a demonic presence
in that house
you need to get vic before he leaves
we need to go back
okay
mom help me please
mom
please mom help me
help
ha ha ha
for gods sake
leave us alone
margaret
margaret no
no
come on lets get out of here
come on lets get out
go to peggys house
what youre not coming
i cant leave janet
no janet
mum
janet
well i dont understand it
i mean first you say its not real
now it is
her sight was being blocked
by the inhuman spirit
the old mans spirit
couldnt break through
until we left that house
everything theyve experienced
has been a manifestation of the demonic
the old man the crooked man
theyre just a facade
trying to keep us from seeing
the real evil in that house
in my vision he wanted to help me
but he was too afraid
and he kept speaking
in a kind of riddle
something like uh
i am given and i am taken
i was there at your first breath
you didnt ask for me
but i will follow you until your death
your name you didnt ask for it
it was given when you were born
thats it
knowing the demons name
gives us power over it
and we can cast it out
yeah sure
but we dont know its name
but maybe we do
huh
why else would he give us that clue
he must think that
we know it somehow
so what do you do now
an inhuman spirit powerful enough
to cloud lorraines sight
is more than a match for me
we need to get janet to the church
before it kills her
janet
what happened
