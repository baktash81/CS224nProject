hi
weve gotta talk
about moms condition
shes aged five years in three months
she almost burned the house down
is it my fault
it doesnt help
that you dont answer the phone
when she calls to say
the house is on fire
so she sent you to meet me right
i dont know why you guys
do this through me
every time she calls im in a meeting
i thought you quit
what
chris said you quit
i havent spoken to chris
sean spoke to chris
when he returned the car
what
um
this is yours and
thats not mine
it was in the car
also found a roll of film
i got these printed for you
oh
ive gotta go i got a work thing bye
i love you
love you
you know i wouldnt worry about it
people wanna kill this woman
with the mistake shes made
the case is practically won
with two to eight years imprisonment
the gross negligence on not calling
an ambulance in time to a dying baby
should be enough to put her away
all right
and as your criminal lawyer
with your testimony
we have this case in the bag
if you guys decide to slap her
with a civil case as well
i can get someone to handle that
someone that i trust
i feel like you got
a good shot at winning both
and you could win millions
you know about this bridge
huh
this bridge you got on the wall
no
theres a big story behind this bridge
uhhuh
in the 40s this thing
just disintegrates into the floor
its a big deal
its the third biggest bridge in the us
you got the golden gate george washington
and then you got the tacoma
in the 40s things collapse
and they cant figure it out
and they bring in these experts
mathematicians scientists
nobody could figure it out
took a look at foundations
suspension wire nothing
everything checks out
then finally
one of these scientists says resonance
what
resonance you know what that is
no
resonance is um
you know every solid object
has its own vibration
when the outer one matches
the inner one you get resonance
sometimes resonance can be so powerful
it can bring a whole bridge down
does it happen often
no like um
like when swings move
by themselves at the playground
thats resonance thank you
for everything
here to help
yeah
talk about the ways to go
all the things we dream about
in the night and every day
all the plans we have to make
in the night in the night
i think you read my mind

thats true
it was a good band man
thank you
good time to be in a band
it was
that whole grunge revival scene
oh man
its crazy when you had
the white stripes right
stripes were there who else
mmhmm they had the hives
hives strokes beck
nah beck is different hes softer
you guys had a grit harder
um what was it the stripes did
you need help
stripes were like um
huh

no i just had another glass
what was it they were brother
they were husband they were brother
they were pretending
to be brother and sister
or to be husband and wife
stripes
stripes yes
there was this thing
who are they
smart
the white stripes
are they a band
youre funny
you dont know the white stripes
no
really
this is
no the white stripes
this is insane
come on 2001 2002
were you living under a rock
they did a coke commercial
seven nation army
that fucking song boy

yeah i know that song
yeah
they play it at the
yes
so the story with them goes
theres a twoperson band
uhhuh
boy and a girl boys name is jack white
girls name is uh
meg
meg and theyre in a band
but their band is uh
theyre in a marriage
theyre in a marriage theyre telling
people theyre brother and sister
theyre actually married
falling apart in front of the world
so like sonny and cher
its like you look at them
and everybodys like oh my god
are they fighting
theyre not listening to the music
youre into the gossip
exactly
not into the music
if youre watching a couple play music
youre not thinking whats up
with the song this instrumentation
youre thinking are they fucking
whered they meet do they got kids
its terrible
you look at donny and marie opposite
yeah but their music sucked
so you didnt care either way
but you didnt wanna think
about anything happening
its true if they sucked
and they were brother
yes so my point
hey so what happened with your band
uh i dont know so stupid
everybody kind of grew up and moved on
to different bands
or different sounds
no its just
its like okay great you go be a dad
you dont have time for this
looking at me like im a child
rest of the band
yeah i mean the way
he talked to me i didnt like that
well he was older than you
yeah but it was
just so condescending
like im so much better than you
because i have kids
yeah that wouldnt be right
right
its like what does it matter
it doesnt change your life
no to go do that
when youre young like that
on the verge of breaking through
no makes total sense
whats that tone
i dont understand
whats going on
what tone
martha were just talking

youre ashamed
youre so ashamed of me
youre ashamed because i failed
oh what a disgrace
what a disgrace
i failed
yes
youre fucking ashamed
and im ashamed of me
that i wasnt a good enough mother
to teach you how to stand up
and speak for yourself for gods sakes
and to deal with this
like my mother taught me
after my father went into the ghetto
my mother found a shack an empty shack
that she went into and gave birth to me
without any help at all
she stashed me under the floorboards
when she had to go out and steal food
so she could make milk
enough to keep me alive
but just alive
not strong enough to cry
or wed be caught
when she finally got me to a doctor
he advised her to just let me go
that i wasnt
i wasnt strong enough to survive
but when she absolutely insisted
he picked me up by my feet
and held me up like a chicken and said
if she tries to lift her head
then theres hope
and you know what i did martha
i lifted my head
thats what im asking you to do now
lift your head and fight for yourself
for gods sakes
go out there and face that woman
tell her what its like for you now
what this feels like
you have to do this martha
you have to speak your truth
otherwise youre never gonna
be able to deal with this
youre never gonna be able to move on
youve got to move on past this martha
stop it stop it
maybe ill go make some tea
i know my dad always makes tea when
when his daughters loathe him

of former midwife
and passionate homebirth advocate
eva woodward
is wrapping up in court today
the 45yearold is charged
with the homebirth death of a baby
okay good thank you
well she could have told
just give me one second hey martha
thank you for agreeing to this
i can assure you
she will serve time in prison
it should be a walk in the park
i know
all rise
hear ye hear ye hear ye
all persons having anything to do
before the honorable judge spencer
now sitting in the county of suffolk
the justices of this court draw near
give your attention
and you shall be heard
god save
the commonwealth of massachusetts
the court is open you may be seated
yesterday
we heard opening arguments
onstate versus eva woodward
prosecution through the district attorney
carries the burden of proof
therefore the prosecution will go first
you may call your first witness
your honor
the commonwealth calls martha weiss
ms weiss please come
forward and be sworn in by the clerk
stand there please
raise your right hand
do you promise to tell the truth
the whole truth and nothing but the truth
i do
please state your name
martha weiss
may i your honor
please
could you please tell the court
how the defendant came to be
the midwife for the delivery of your baby
she was standing in
for our original midwife
who couldnt make it to the house in time
but you werent happy
when you heard she was going to be coming
instead of your chosen midwife barbara
i didnt know her
but i thought it would be fine
you trusted her
to safely deliver your baby
i did yes
may i ask why you trusted her
because um barbara did
and because she was qualified i guess
during the labor ms woodward
was taking the babys heart rate
to see if the baby was okay
and that she could handle the labor
yes
the first time she checked
the babys heart rate it was strong yes
yes it was
how many times
did she check the heart rate
about three i would say
three times
yes
thats all only three times
yes
and then
she told you to take a bath
yes
did she take
the babys heart rate while in the bath
no
so let me get this straight
theres a sustained period of time
while you were in the bath
where the babys heart rate
was not being monitored
yes
did she ever communicate to you
explicitly that a lowered heart rate
could mean that the baby was in distress
and that this could cause her death
she didnt say that to me
if you knew about the risk would you
have demanded to go to the hospital
of course i would have
wanted to know that
would you ever willingly harm your baby
of course not
no so if in one of the most
difficult moments of your life
during a difficult labor
the woman who youve decided
to put your trust in
whos been present at hundreds of births
has far more experience than you do
turns to you and says
you must go to the hospital right now
would you have gone in yes or no
yes i would have
no further questions your honor
mr lane crossexamine
thank you your honor
first may i say
how deeply sorry i am for your loss
thank you
may i ask you
why you decided on a home birth
i wanted the baby to decide
when she wanted to come
would it be fair to say
you were absolutely determined
to have a home birth
that you had your heart set on it
yes
and your partner agreed with you
we agreed to do it together yes
and you both knew if there was a problem
you may have to go to the hospital
to deliver the baby is that true
of course yes
because at a hospital
you knew that should a problem arise
that there was equipment
yes i knew that
there was expertise in a crisis
yes
and yet when complications did arrive
and your midwife suggested
you may consider going to the hospital
because of a heart arrhythmia
you decided to stay at the house
yes but she didnt say that to me no
let me ask this you said earlier
you trust your midwife is that right
i did
yes and do you trust your husband
my partner
yes
yes i do did
because your partner
has given testimony
that your midwife strongly advised
you should go to the hospital
you say youre working together as a team
and when your partner asked you
to go to the hospital you refused to go
is that correct
is that correct
i wanted to stay at home myself
and you actively and adamantly
stated that to your husband
that you didnt want
to go to the hospital
i did yes
the few moments
after your baby was born
was her breathing disturbed
or was there anything
to indicate her condition was poor
no not at
did you hear her cry
yes a bit
did you hold her
yes i held
was her body warm or cold
i cant remember that
you cant remember that
did you notice anything strange
did you notice that her feet
were turning blue and purple
i didnt look at her feet
did you look at her hands
no
you didnt look at her feet or her hands
did you notice the color of her eyes
did you notice
whether she had blonde hair
dark hair lots of hair no hair
yes she
pardon me
it was dark yes
her hair was dark yes
did you notice anything else
that her fingers were long
or her toes did she have ten fingers
i said i looked at her face
you looked at her face
yes
what did you feel
when you were holding your baby
how did i feel
yes how did you feel holding
your baby you had just given birth to
she smelled like an apple
she smelled like an apple
mmhmm
what did she feel was the question
did she feel like a healthy baby
she did yes
yes
if your baby had died
because of something like sids
objection your honor
sids has not been established
as a definite cause of death
let the jury decide not the witness
i would like to hear the witnesss
testimony as to her state of mind
if you feel you can answer
the question i would like you to
can i have a break
just one minute
mr lane
i have no further questions your honor
then this court will be
in recess till this afternoon
thank you
the trial will continue after the break
all rise
can i help you
um do you have any photos here
under the name of weiss
weiss
weiss
um oh yeah
we prepared the negatives
but we didnt print any
cause we never heard back
you wanna check them out
yes is that okay
sure
there you go
can you print them right now
sure
it just takes a second
ill be back in a minute
oh god
oh god
your honor id like to submit
additional documents indicating
certain inconsistencies that were
presented earlier by the prosecution
could i just have
a word with the judge
directly
yes
thats not usually allowed
i know but do you mind asking
i will ask him
thank you
please wait here
judge miss weiss
would like to address the court
thats highly unusual
but id like to hear what she has to say
miss weiss you wish to address the court
yes thank you
this woman
did not intentionally harm my girl
she only wanted to deliver
a healthy baby that night
and i do not think it is your fault
i do not think it is her fault
and thank you
there might be a reason for what happened
but we are not gonna find it in this room
and if i stand here
and ask for compensation or money
then i am
im saying that
i can be compensated and i cant
i cant bring her back
no money or verdicts or sentences can
can bring back what
how can i give this pain to someone else
someone whos already suffered
and i know she would not want that
at all
that is not why
my daughter came into this world
for the time that she did
and that is all i have to say thank you
thank you miss weiss
