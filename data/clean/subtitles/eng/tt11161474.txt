regarding the cause of death 
during the criminal autopsy 
we ran histology  toxicology
and microbiology screens 
the results of the exam show no signs
of a preexisting infection 
chromosomal abnormality
or irregularity of the placenta 
what we did determine was the little girl
was in a low oxygen environment 
in 60  to 70  of these cases 
we rarely find a satisfactory explanation 
  you re a doctor  yeah  what s your name

you re a fucking doctor 
there are certain things 
medically  we just don t have answers for 
there s already proceedings

very soon to determine   
what about your medical expert opinion 
you re a medical expert 
i mean  what do you   
you don t know anything 
if it could have been prevented 
who s at fault 
you don t know shit is what you re saying

looking for something
about sprouting 
mm hmm 
i ve got a better book than that 
try this 
no  this one  yeah 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
hi 
we ve gotta talk
about mom s condition 
she s aged five years in three months 
she almost burned the house down 
is it my fault 
it doesn t help
that you don t answer the phone
when she calls to say
the house is on fire 
so she sent you to meet me  right 
i don t know why you guys
do this through me 
every time she calls  i m in a meeting   
  i thought you quit 
  what 
  chris said you quit 
  i haven t spoken to chris 
sean spoke to chris
when he returned the car 
what 
um 
this is yours  and 
  that s not mine 
  it was in the car 
also found a roll of film 
  i got these printed for you 
  oh 
i ve gotta go  i got a work thing  bye 
  i love you 
  love you 
you know  i wouldn t worry about it 
people wanna kill this woman 
with the mistake she s made 
the case is practically won
with two to eight years imprisonment 
the gross negligence on not calling
an ambulance in time to a dying baby
should be enough to put her away 
all right 
and as your criminal lawyer 
with your testimony 
we have this case in the bag 
if you guys decide to slap her
with a civil case as well 
i can get someone to handle that 
someone that i trust 
i feel like you got
a good shot at winning both 
and you could win millions 
you know about this bridge 
huh 
this bridge you got on the wall 
  no 
  there s a big story behind this bridge 
uh huh 
in the  40s  this thing
just disintegrates into the floor 
it s a big deal 
it s the third biggest bridge in the us 
you got the golden gate  george washington
and then you got the tacoma 
in the  40s  things collapse
and they can t figure it out
and they bring in these experts 
mathematicians  scientists 
nobody could figure it out 
took a look at foundations 
suspension wire  nothing 
everything checks out 
then finally 
one of these scientists says  resonance  
what 
resonance  you know what that is 
  no 
  resonance is  um 
you know  every solid object
has its own vibration 
when the outer one matches
the inner one  you get resonance 
sometimes  resonance can be so powerful 
it can bring a whole bridge down 
  does it happen often 
  no  like  um 
like when swings move
by themselves at the playground 
that s resonance  thank you 
for everything 
  here to help 
  yeah 
  talk about the ways to go  
  all the things we dream about  
  in the night and every day  
  all the plans we have to make  
  in the night  in the night  
  i think you read my mind  
  you read my mind but did you know  
  i think you read my mind

 that s pretty good  
what are you doing with your time 
you still playing 
uh  no  it s been a while 
uh  i m just working 
the only type of playing i do
is if they pay me over there  so 
  at the church 
  yep 
well  that s exciting 
  different scene  that s for sure 
  different scene 
worshipers 
yeah  oh  you get that 
better than a groupie 
  kinda the same thing 
  that s true 
  it was a good band  man 
  thank you 
good time to be in a band 
it was 
  that whole grunge revival scene 
  oh  man 
it s crazy  when you had
the white stripes  right 
  stripes were there  who else 
  mm hmm  they had the hives 
hives  strokes  beck 
nah  beck is different  he s softer 
you guys had a grit  harder 
um  what was it the stripes did 
  you need help 
  stripes were like  um 
huh 
  help 
  no  i just had another glass 
what was it  they were brother   
they were husband    they were brother   
they were pretending
to be brother and sister 
or to be husband and wife 
  stripes 
  stripes  yes 
there was this thing 
  who are they 
  smart 
  the white stripes 
  are they a band 
you re funny 
  you don t know the white stripes 
  no 
  really 
  this is 
  no  the white stripes 
  this is insane 
come on  2001  2002 
were you living under a rock 
they did a coke commercial 
 seven nation army  
  that fucking song  boy 
  yeah 
  yeah  i know that song 
  yeah 
  they play it at the   
  yes 
so  the story with them goes 
there s a two person band 
  uh huh 
  boy and a girl  boy s name is jack white 
  girl s name is  uh 
  meg 
meg  and they re in a band 
but their band is  uh 
they re in a marriage 
they re in a marriage  they re telling
people they re brother and sister 
they re actually married 
falling apart in front of the world 
so  like sonny and cher 
it s like  you look at them 
and everybody s like   oh  my god  
 are they fighting  
they re not listening to the music 
  you re into the gossip 
  exactly 
not into the music 
if you re watching a couple play music 
you re not thinking   what s up
with the song  this instrumentation  
you re thinking   are they fucking 
where d they meet  do they got kids  
it s terrible 
you look at donny and marie  opposite 
yeah  but their music sucked 
so you didn t care either way 
but you didn t wanna think
about anything happening 
it s true  if they sucked
and they were brother   
yes  so my point 
hey  so what happened with your band 
uh  i don t know  so stupid 
everybody kind of grew up and moved on 
to different bands
or different sounds 
no  it s just 
it s like   okay  great  you go be a dad 
you don t have time for this  
  looking at me like i m a child 
  rest of the band 
yeah  i mean  the way
he talked to me  i didn t like that 
well  he was older than you 
yeah  but it was
just so condescending 
like   i m so much better than you
because i have kids  
yeah  that wouldn t be right 
right 
it s like   what does it matter  
  it doesn t change your life 
  no  to go do that 
when you re young like that 
on the verge of breaking through 
  no  makes total sense 
  what s that tone 
i don t understand 
  what s going on 
  what tone 
  martha  we re just talking 
  what  i was agreeing with him 
yeah  we re agreeing also 
everybody s agreeing 
  so what s the problem 
  the problem 
don t give him a hard time 
we re just talking 
we re just trying to keep it light 
right  light 
yes  i am 
okay  okay  okay 
i am sorry  i did not put that together 
   baby   i didn t know 
  oh  my god 
what are we even doing here

and she s family  you know

i m in the same store
getting the same apple 
i know because i met him late 
how late  25 minutes 
i spent a minute getting an apple 
the rest of the time  i spent there stuck 
stranded  getting grilled by your friend 
trying to figure out
what the fuck she wants from me 
and you re worried about them judging me 
martha 
it s not even about
them judging me  actually 
it s about how you want me to be
to fit their opinion 
you wanna arrange me 
  you need therapy 
  i do not need therapy  thank you  anita 
  you do  asshole 
  all right 
who cares about what they think 
this is about me  this is about my body 
this is me  do you understand that

but have you decided to go to the trial 
  i m not going to your fucking trial 
  why not  honey 
she has to pay for her incompetence 
  is this about money 
  no 
is it about what people think 
it s about you 
it s about you having to face this thing   
i am facing this 
i am facing it  i am facing this 
well  i don t think you are 
we need    we need some justice here 
no  you need  that is what you want 
that is what you need  that is your way 
that is not my way 
that is what you need 
martha 
if you had done it my way 
you d be holding your baby
in your arms right now 
you know what  you   
you re ashamed 
you re so ashamed of me 
you re ashamed because i failed 
 oh  what a disgrace  
 what a disgrace  
i failed 
  yes 
  you re fucking ashamed 
and i m ashamed of me 
that i wasn t a good enough mother
to teach you how to stand up
and speak for yourself  for god s sakes 
and to deal with this 
like my mother taught me 
after my father went into the ghetto 
my mother found a shack  an empty shack 
that she went into and gave birth to me 
without any help at all 
she stashed me under the floorboards
when she had to go out and steal food
so she could make milk
enough to keep me alive 
but just alive 
not strong enough to cry 
or we d be caught 
when she finally got me to a doctor 
he advised her to just let me go 
that i wasn t 
i wasn t strong enough to survive 
but when she absolutely insisted 
he picked me up by my feet
and held me up like a chicken and said 
 if she tries to lift her head 
then there s hope  
and you know what i did  martha 
i lifted my head 
that s what i m asking you to do now 
lift your head and fight for yourself 
for god s sakes 
go out there and face that woman 
tell her what it s like for you now 
what this feels like 
you have to do this  martha 
you have to speak your truth 
otherwise  you re never gonna
be able to deal with this 
you re never gonna be able to move on 
you ve got to move on past this  martha 
stop it  stop it 
maybe i ll go make some tea 
i know my dad always makes tea when   
when his daughters loathe him 
i think martha s starting over 
good  i m sorry  i   
i never liked you 
  and it s not because you re poor 
  no  it s  cause i m  um   
 cause i m not an intellectual 
and i m not    i don t use big words 
and  cause i m rough and i m   
well  here s a scrabbleword 
 cause i m boorish 
ooh 
what do you want

i probably want to go home 
yeah  that s what i want the most 
and why don t you 
we don t all live like this  you know

the manslaughter trial
of former midwife
and passionate home birth advocate 
eva woodward 
is wrapping up in court today 
the 45 year old is charged
with the home birth death of a baby 
okay  good  thank you 
well  she could have told   
just give me one second  hey  martha 
thank you for agreeing to this 
i can assure you
she will serve time in prison 
  it should be a walk in the park 
  i know 
all rise 
hear ye  hear ye  hear ye 
all persons having anything to do
before the honorable judge spencer 
now sitting in the county of suffolk 
the justices of this court  draw near 
give your attention 
and you shall be heard 
god save
the commonwealth of massachusetts 
the court is open  you may be seated 
yesterday 
we heard opening arguments
onstate versus eva woodward 
prosecution through the district attorney
carries the burden of proof 
therefore  the prosecution will go first 
you may call your first witness 
your honor 
the commonwealth calls martha weiss 
ms  weiss  please come
forward and be sworn in by the clerk 
stand there  please 
raise your right hand 
do you promise to tell the truth 
the whole truth and nothing but the truth 
  i do 
  please state your name 
martha weiss 
  may i  your honor 
  please 
could you please tell the court
how the defendant came to be
the midwife for the delivery of your baby 
she was standing in
for our original midwife
who couldn t make it to the house in time 
but you weren t happy
when you heard she was going to be coming
instead of your chosen midwife  barbara 
i didn t know her 
but i thought it would be fine 
you trusted her
to safely deliver your baby 
  i did  yes 
  may i ask why you trusted her 
because  um  barbara did
and because she was qualified  i guess 
during the labor  ms  woodward
was taking the baby s heart rate
to see if the baby was okay
and that she could handle the labor 
yes 
the first time she checked
the baby s heart rate  it was strong  yes 
yes  it was 
how many times
did she check the heart rate 
about three  i would say 
  three times 
  yes 
  that s all  only three times 
  yes 
and then
she told you to take a bath 
yes 
did she take
the baby s heart rate while in the bath 
  no 
  so  let me get this straight 
there s a sustained period of time
while you were in the bath
where the baby s heart rate
was not being monitored 
yes 
did she ever communicate to you
explicitly that a lowered heart rate
could mean that the baby was in distress
and that this could cause her death 
she didn t say that to me 
if you knew about the risk  would you
have demanded to go to the hospital 
of course i would have
wanted to know that 
  would you ever willingly harm your baby 
  of course not 
no  so if in one of the most
difficult moments of your life 
during a difficult labor 
the woman who you ve decided
to put your trust in 
who s been present at hundreds of births 
has far more experience than you do 
turns to you and says 
 you must go to the hospital right now  
would you have gone in  yes or no 
yes  i would have 
no further questions  your honor 
mr  lane  cross examine 
thank you  your honor 
first  may i say
how deeply sorry i am for your loss 
thank you 
may i ask you
why you decided on a home birth 
i wanted the baby to decide
when she wanted to come 
would it be fair to say
you were absolutely determined
to have a home birth 
that you had your heart set on it 
  yes 
  and your partner agreed with you 
we agreed to do it together  yes 
and you both knew if there was a problem 
you may have to go to the hospital
to deliver the baby  is that true 
of course  yes 
because at a hospital 
you knew that should a problem arise 
  that there was equipment   
  yes  i knew that 
  there was expertise in a crisis   
  yes 
and yet  when complications did arrive 
and your midwife suggested
you may consider going to the hospital
because of a heart arrhythmia 
you decided to stay at the house 
yes  but she didn t say that to me  no 
let me ask this  you said earlier
you trust your midwife  is that right
