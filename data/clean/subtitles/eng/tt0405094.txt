address him as captain
come in
sit down
hands under your thighs
palms down
what do you have to tell us
i havent done anything
i dont know anything
youve done nothing
know nothing
so you think we just
arrest innocent citizens on a whim
no not
if you think our humane system
is capable of something like that
thatd be reason enough
to arrest you
we want to jog your memory
prisoner 227
your friend and neighbor
fled the republic on september 28th
and we have reason to believe
he was helped
i dont know anything about it
he never told me he wanted to leave
i first heard about it at work
describe what you did
on the 28th of september
thats already on record
once more please
i took my kids to the park for a walk
ran into an old classmate
there max kirchner
went to his place and
listened to music into the evening
he has a phone you can call him
hell corroborate everything
i can gladly give you the number
the enemy of our state is arrogant
remember that
we have to be patient with him some 40 hours of patience
ill fast forward some
i want to sleep
please let me sleep
hands under your thighs
please explain again
what you did on september 28th
please just an hour just a little
just a little sleep
tell me again what you did on this day
why did you have to keep him
awake for so long
i mean thats inhumane
an innocent prisoner becomes angrier
every hour he is kept there
because of the injustice done to him
he screams and rants
a guilty one becomes quieter
says nothing
or starts to cry
he knows that he rightly sits there
if you want to know
whether someone is guilty or not
the best way is to keep asking
until they no longer can
classmate max kirchner
we went to his place
and listened to music into the evening
he has a phone
you can call him
hell corroborate everything
anyone notice anything
about this statement
he says pretty much
the same thing
he says exactly the same thing
word for word
those who tell the truth
can paraphrase whenever
do that as well
a liar has particular sentences to fall back on
during states of increased stress
227 is lying we have 2 important indications
and can increase the intensity
if you dont tell me the name of the escapees helper
your wife will be arrested tonight
and your kids put into
a state reformatory
is that what you want
whats the helpers name
who was it
glaesker
come again louder
glaesker werner glaesker
wernerglaesker
quiet
quiet
listen
can anyone tell me
what that is
the preserved scent for the dogs
its to be removed after every interrogation
and never left behind
with interrogation you are working
with enemies of socialism
dont forget that
have a nice day
that was good
that was really good
how was it
when we sat here together 20 years ago
ya know they proposed me
for a professor job
see grades dont matter in the real world
even though mine werent too bad
whats on your agenda
why do you always think
i have a hidden agenda
i just wanted to invite you to the theater
the theater
i heard that minister bruno hempf
is going to be there tonight
i ought to attend
as head of the culture department
it starts at 7
we should get going
the lives of others
minister bruno hempf
1 oclock
he worked for the ministry
before he was called into the central committee
cleaned house in those
days with the theater scene
georg dreyman the poet
hes the kind of arrogant guy
i always warn my students about
arrogant but loyal
if everyone were like him
id be jobless
hes our only unsuspicious author
and is still read in the west
for him the gdr is the best
country in the world
see for yourself
dear child whats wrong
a new vision
say something martha please
your arthur
no longer lives
arthur isnt it possible
youre wrong this time
no sisters believe me
he has fallen into death
the powerful wheel has ground him up
i see it
and would rather see any other horror
why am i not spared from this vision
elena go home
and did you like it
dreymans good huh
i would have him monitored
monitored that teaching is
corrupting your instincts wiesler
id even be the point man
i told you hes cleaner than clean
even hempf came to his premiere
if you monitor someone like that
you bite the hand that feeds
im going downstairs for a sec
faces of love
im hearing a lot about your work
they say our culture is in good hands
your name is mentioned
often in the party
were the shield and
sword of the party minister
were conscious of that every moment
what do you think of him
georg dreyman
maybe
maybe what
maybe hes notnot as clean as it seems
grubitz thats why guys like you
and me are at the top
the standard stasi schmuck wouldve said
hes one of our countrys best loyal all this garbage
but we see more
you could make it up the ladder grubitz
theres something fishy about him
i feel it in my gut and it doesnt lie
next week thursday is a party at dreymans
a few shady people are coming
hauser and those vermin
try and organize something by then
something small and discreet
procedures a and b
just his apartment nothing flashy
he has powerful friends
no one can find out about this
until weve found something
and when you find something against him
youve got a fat friend in the central committee
know what i mean
minister have a good evening
whys he still watching
whats he even doing here
i think he fancies you
i insist on proposing the toast tonight
to our community of culture
a famous socialist once said
the poet is the engineer of the soul
and georg dreyman is one of the most
important engineers in our country
charming comrades
paul stop that
and of course christamaria sieland
she is the most beautiful pearl of the gdr
i wont accept any objections to that
so please raise your glasses and toast
to christamaria sieland may you live long
the fact someone like that can even address you
please stay here
and now another lively number
may i
how did you like my little speech
thank you very much
i liked your play as well
really it was good
engineer of the soul
that was stalin you quoted
oh yeah
well i like to provoke
every now and then hauser
but on the other hand
i know how far i can take that
in that way im more like
our dear dreyman
he knows that the party needs the artist
but the artist the party even more
if you guys want to talk politics
i need to find someone else to dance with
im ready
too late too late
ive been following the developments
of our theater for a while
didnt you follow them professionally before
paul
its fine herr dreyman
weve known each other for a long time
herr schweiber
you did a fine job tonight as well
dreyman im glad youre
working with such directors now
there were other times though
you mean jerska
i think you sentenced him too harshly
of course his statement
crossed the line no question
but
put yourself in his position for a minute
you as a man of your word
he cant take back his signature
from this declaration
comrade hempf the man could
work at any theater in the west
but he doesnt want to leave
because he firmly believes in socialism and this country
his career ban is absolute
who said anything about a career ban
that doesnt exist here
you ought to choose your words more carefully
comrade hempf ill tell you this now
my plays arent so good
that someone like schweiber could direct them
i need jerska
and i think you sentenced him too hard
see here i dont think so
but thats what we all love about your plays
the love of man good people
believing that someone can change
dreyman
no matter how often
you write that in your plays
people dont change
so hows he doing anyway
he was hoping that his career b
that hed be allowed to work again soon
can he hope
of course as long as hes alive and even longer
as you know dreyman
hope is the last thing to die
the tech team will be ready
tomorrow morning for the wiretapping
its important that everythings done by thursday
its all up to you
can you manage that
good night
need to go
otherwise ill get in trouble
by who
my girlfriend
20 minutes
yes
frau meineke one word to anyone
and your marscha loses
her acceptance to medical school
is that understood
yeah
send frau meineke a thankyou gift
for her secrecy
thursday already
time goes by too fast
its better so
howre you doing
not too bad
its not always this noisy
i know just on thursdays
yeah
we missed you at the premiere
schweiber have a good epiphany
what was good he stole from you
thats how my ideas stay alive
dont think me evil but i cant stand
the sight of these fat spiffed up people at such a premiere
that doesnt sound like me does it
but maybe it does after all
maybe that wasnt the real me back then
friendly and kind to people
off the concentrated feed of success
for which im indebted
to the big shots for their mercy
but ill stop complaining
in my next life i want to be a writer
a happy writer who can write all the time
like you
what does a director have
if hes not allowed to direct
nothing more than a projectionist without films
a miller without flour he has nothing left
nothing left
albert the minister was at
the premiere too minister hempf
i talked to him about your ban
its looking good
he gave me some hope
was very literal very specific
really
thats nice
jerska the wine connoisseur
and hows our sacred drinker doing is he coming
i forgot to ask him
youre vigorous and strong
and i need you
dont bring this destructive cycle into your life
alberts my friend
and youre mine too
looks like something for a 50th birthday party
im turning 40 though arent i
dont forget you promised to wear
a tie for your birthday
i would but i dont have one
no more excuses
a tie
you did say you didnt want any books
or cant you tie one after all
you old working poet
ya think i cant tie a tie
i was born with a tie
you forget i had to break free
of this chain of the middle class
then chain yourself to it just once more for me
tying a tie
a minor detail
frau meineke
come here for a second
can you tie a tie
you cant imagine
how grateful i am
something wrong
no im fine
done
wonderful its perfect
couldnt be better
but this has to be our secret
you can keep a secret cant you
yes
gosh i really didnt
think you could do it
you dont beat around the bush
when it comes to what you can do
you just didnt know
i can do almost anything
our first guest
our dear good neighbors
locked the door downstairs
can you go
on my way
master our present
i specifically said no books thank you
want something to drink
sure a seltzer
vodka for me
ill get it
what the hell
whys albert sitting by himself
he doesnt want to talk to us
he just turned us away
i brought you something too
did you really come here to read
its brecht anyway
i feel like an impostor
amongst all these people
impostor come on albert
youre losing grip on reality
you know we admire you
every one admires you
yeah for something i did
10 years ago
and probably could never do again
ah my favorite director
wait a sec i need to talk to you
man explain to me exactly
how you got this job
your talent naturally of course
but what else did you do hm
every one knows
youre with the stasi you washout
thats an unbelievable allegation
dont forget that
paul
what
schweiber excuse my friend
hes had too much to drink
whats with you
you know hes with the stasi
no paul
i dont know that
youre such a miserable idealist
youre almost some big shot
who do you think messed up jerska so bad
people like that
narks traitors and conformers
you have to pick a side sometime
otherwise youre not a person
if you want to do something about it then call me
otherwise we dont need to see each other anymore
your friends dont have much taste do they
thats really unfair
the back scratcher for example
its wonderful
thats a salad fork
never the less
wonderful
check this out
ill write my next play with this
you dont have any taste either
for some things i do
from jerska
probably gave you a book
the sonata of good men
1104 pm lazlo and cms unwrapped gifts
afterwards prob sexual intercourse
youre late
excuse me captain i got stuck at a red light
can easily lose 4 minutes there
you know how it is
already at it eh i dont believe it
these artists theyve got it going on
ya know colleague thats why i
monitor artists instead of priests or peacekeepers
see you tomorrow at 11am
albert jerska the engerling file
wiesler systematic as usual
take your jacket off
lets get some lunch
volleyball game at 7pm tonight

wiesler were not allowed to record senior comrades
i deleted the citation from your report
next time theres something like this
report it to me verbally in person
were helping our committee member
get rid of his rival
in light of this new information
i dont need to say what that means for my career
and for yours
if we do find something
is that why we enlisted
remember what we swore
to be the shield and sword of the party
and whats the party other than its members
if theyve got a lot of influence
all the better
ive got a new one
so honecker comes into his office
in the morning
opens the window looks at the sun
and says

bye
georg did you heard about hauser
no what about him
his lecture tour in the west was cancelled
he didnt get a travel permit
are you surprised
if hes going to act so arrogant
he ought to expect something like this to happen
would you allow him to travel
if you were in their shoes
lazlo supports hausers travel abroad ban
have you seen my yellow volume of brecht
what
my brecht volume
dont know where it is
weird i cant find it
on that day in bluemooned september
quiet under a young plum tree
i held her there that silent pale love
in my arms like a graceful dream
and above us in the summer sky
was a cloud i saw for a time
on top it was white and tremendous
and as i looked up there was not but one sign
yes
georg this is wallner
what is it
georg its about jerska
hes dead
he hanged himself last night
georg
im gonna hang up ok
im thinking about what
lenin said about beethovens appassionata
i cant listen to it
otherwise i wont be able to finish the revolution
can someone whos
listened to this music
really listened
still be a bad person
do you really work for the stasi
do you know what that is the stasi
yes my dad says theyre
bad men who lock people up
i see
whats the name of your
my what
your ball
whats your balls name
youre weird
balls dont have names
everything is happening minister
stateoftheart technology
under every light switch
even in the john
the foyer is being monitored per procedure c
you said youd find something
find something already
i wouldnt want my worst enemy
to disappoint me
get out of here
nowack youre going to monitor christamaria
report every minute shes not
with me understood
we banned hausers travel permit
maybe thatll get something going
those two are pretty close
hows it going between
cms and the minister
theyre meeting tomorrow night
if i understand their rhythm
good the both of us have a lot
to gain from their love story
or a lot to lose
dont forget that
in the past
i was scared of only 2 things
being alone and not being able to write
since alberts death
i dont care about writing
or other people
now im just afraid of being without you
dont be scared of losing me tonight
im just going out for an hour
where
im meeting up with a classmate
really christa
really
what are you getting at
i know
i know where you want to go
and im asking you dont go
you dont need him
you dont need him
i know about the pills too
and how little you trust your art
at least trust me
christamaria
you are a great artist
i know it
and your audience knows it too
you dont need him
you dont need him
stay here
dont go to him
no i dont need him
dont need this scandalous system
what about you
you dont need it either
even less than i do
but youre in bed with him too
why
because they can destroy you too
despite your talent you havent doubted yet
because they decide
who can act and direct
you dont want to end up like jerska
and i dont want that either
and thats why im going
youre right about many things
i want to do things differently
but im asking you
im begging you dont go
so boss on time
lemme guess
what theyre up to
come on ill take over
i cant be held responsible
for you doing overtime because of me
dont go through this door
wheres she off to
meeting an old schoolmate
you can read the detailed report tomorrow
ill take care of it
good night
whatre you staring at
seltzer
no uh vodka
a double
another shot
bring me a cognac please
maam
please let me be
i want to be alone
frau sieland
do we know each other
you dont know me
but i know you
a lot of people love you
because you are how you are
acting isnt real
with you it is
ive seen you on stage
you were more yourself then than
than how you are now
so you know how i am
i am your audience
i have to go
where are you going
im meeting an old schoolmate i
you see you werent
yourself at all just then
no
no
you know this christamaria sieland well
what do you think
would she hurt someone who completely loves her
would she sell herself for the art
sell herself for art
but she has the art already
thatd be terrible business
you are a great artist
dont you know that
and you are a good person
as i took over lazlo and cms were arguing
about whether cms should meet her schoolmate
finally she went
lazlo seemed unhappy about this
after about 20 minutes
cms returned to lazlo
to his and my surprise
he seemed quite happy
fervid intimacy ensued
she said shed never leave again
he said repeatedly i have the strength now
i will do something
here it is assumed
he will write a new play
lazlos play production has been plagued
with difficulty over the last few weeks
what her comment means is uncertain
perhaps she wants to take care
of lazlos household now more than before
the rest of the night was peaceful
captain
i was just uh
good report
really
i didnt know he was doing so badly
me either
from someone whos crossed over
the states head office for statistics on hans beimler st
counts everything knows everything
how many shoes i buy per year 23
how many books i read in a year 32
and how many students graduate
every year with an 40 gpa 6347
but there is one number not registered
perhaps because such a figure
hurts even the bureaucrats suicides
if you called the beimler st office and asked
how many people between the elbe
and oder rivers
between the baltic sea and
ore mnts were driven to death from desperation
then our oracle of numbers remains silent
and probably writes down
your full name
for the state security
those grey men who take care
of our countrys security and happiness
since 1977 our country has ceased
counting cases of suicide
murdering oneself
thats what they call it
this act has nothing to do with murder
it knows no bloodlust
it knows no passion
it only knows dying
the dying of hope
9 years ago when we stopped counting suicides
only one european country had a higher suicide rate
hungary
after them was us
the country of the living breathing socialism
one of these uncounted is albert jerska
the great director
today id like to talk about him
im trying to get some stats on
how much more effective our
states security works as is generally believed
stupid me i practiced my lecture for the tour here
since then ive taken quite a taste in music
should we meet at my place
3pm ehrenmal pankow
is this safe enough
my own personal bodyguard
i call him rolf thats probably his name too
shoot
here
you want to publish this
in the west with your help
will you help me
have you told christa about this
no
good ill help you
under the condition you
continue to keep it a secret
what
georg its for her protection
this is something for der spiegel magazine
im good friends with one of the directors
gregor hessenstein you know him
not personally
you need to meet him
but publishing under your name
is out of the question
unless an intensive
48 hour interrogation sounds appealing
man its cold
so to my place after all
there are no stasi watching me
may i remind you im a personal friend of
margot honecker and a national prize winner
2nd class winner
im telling you guys my places clean
well if we could somehow be sure
i had an idea how we could check your apartment
you guys know my uncle frank visits every saturday
from west berlin with his slick gold mercedes
for herr hauser
this seems pretty risky
yeah georgs right
just dismantling the back seat and
hiding your nephew underneath
i dont know
i just dont know
believe me fellas
they wont look under there
quick glance under the axle
knock on the exhaust pipe and thats it im over paul too
they certainly arent the brightest on the border
you guys have that all wrong
which border crossing are you taking
heinrichheine street
always heinrichheine street
the guys know me there me and my gold benz
im good friends with the border patrol
believe me ill call in 2 hours
with a bottle of schultheiss in hand
and give you guys the good message
paul is over
whats up with pauls stasiguy
rolf rolfy
he thinks paulys at home
alright i gotta go
otherwise the boys gonna suffocate in the car
then hed really be in trouble wouldnt he
want another beer
checkpoint heinrichheine street
subscriber
subscriber
whatever
just this once friend
dreyman
ok as promised paul is over
no checks nothing
naw nothing out of the ordinary
those guys arent that bad
so hes over
thank you for doing this for us
dont mention it
it wasnt all that dangerous
yeah i guess not
yeah good then thank you see ya
later
what do we say
if someone asks what were doing together
well say
well say youre helping me
write a play
for the 40th anniversary of the gdr
yeah
thats sort of right
who wouldve thought
our states security is so inept
whod of thought such idiots even exist
just wait
732pm no further noteworthy incidents
hi captain
listen to this for a sec
for those in the west we know why the rate
was the highest in 67
but in 1977 you need to explain that
clarify the social conditions
it ought to still be a literary piece
not a journalistic inflammatory pamphlet
the article is great the way it is
i just want to make sure
that itll be properly understood on our end
its going to create a stir either way
thats hauser
of course thats hauser
then hes not in the wes
theyre writing a play together
for the 40th anniversary
well it doesnt sound like a play to me
what does it sound like to you
i dunno but not a play
you think quite a bit 1st sergeant leier
are you an intellectual
me no thats not me
then dont act like one
i chose you for this assignment
for your technical skills not for asking questions
let your superiors do the thinking
sorry captain ill justuh
have a good day uh great day
good work i meangood luck with the work
i can probably rewrite this
ill send you then
what we have on the subjects
two weeks can you handle that
then i can possibly get it
into the first march issue maybe even the cover
thats christa
georg
christa this is gregor hessenstein
christa sieland
yes i know
so whatre you guys conspiring to do
hauser and i wanted to write a play
together for the republics 40th anniversary
written by 2 people
der spiegel might do a report on it maybe
and whos playing the main lead
we actually wanted to ask you that
christa which role would you rather have
lenin or his dear old mother
you can choose
well i can see im not wanted here
im gonna take a nap
i commend your caution
the less people that know about this project the better
the stasi arent people you want to trifle with
with that in mind
i brought you something
i wouldve preferred the torte
i already have a typewriter
one thats been documented by the stasi
if this text is written with your typewriter
and intercepted at the border
then youll be thrown into
hohenschoenhausen the next day
and that wouldnt be too swell
paul can attest that huh
unfortunately all i have in this miniformat is red
that bother you
writing the article in red
shouldnt be a problem
you have a place to hide
the typewriter after using it
im sure ill come up with something
dont treat this lightly
i dont want the next article to be
wheres georg dreyman gone to
no one other than us knows
this typewriter even exists
is the apartment really secure
yeah
this apartment is the last place in the gdr
where i can say what i want unpunished
good then lets drink to that
the bottle is real
cheers to you for showing all of germany
the true face of the gdr
cheers this is better than the russian stuff
heres to a great success
i need to see comrade grubitz
its urgent
im sorry but the earliest available
time is tomorrow at 230
if our informants exposed
then well get rid of the congregation close the whole church
its as simple as that
he ought to call the pope
and complain to him
now thats enough
ive had enough of this nonsense
wiesler glad youre here
gotta show you something
terms of imprisonment for politicalideological dissidents
of the art scene according to personality profiles
pretty academic huh
check this out
disseration advised by professor anton grubitz
how do ya like that
i gave them a b they shouldnt think that
earning their doctorate is easy with me
but this is really great work
did you know for example
there are only 5 kinds of artists
for example dreyman
hes type 4 hysterical anthropocentric
cant be alone always has to talk
have friends around
you wouldnt want to put someone
like this on trial hed flourish there
everything has to be done by the book outside the public eye
were done with him quicker that way
complete isolation without telling him
how long hell be there
no contact with anyone
not even with the guards
best way to deal with him
no persecution maltreatment or scandals
nothing he could write about later
after 10 months we let him go
to his surprise
doesnt give us any more trouble
you know what the best part is
most of these type 4s we dealt with
dont write any more
or paint or whatever it is artists do
and thats without us pressuring them
its just
so to speak
their fate
what did you want
any developments from dreyman
i wanted to talk to you about that
i think its time
time for what
that we make the operation smaller
i dont think day and night shifts
are required for such an uncertain case
uncertain huh
so you dont think well find
anything for the minister
maybe if the operation were
smaller and more mobile
if we could find out some things about lazlo
outside of his apartment
should i give udo the case
id rather take it myself
why
might still find something
i need to be able to
come and go as i please
during the day at night
maybe hes doing something
outside his apartment
something about this bothers me
youre not telling me something
fine ill pull udo out
i could actually use him in this church case
file the request with me
in writing
and give lack of suspicious facts
as your reasoning
and wiesler
a piece of advice
were not in school anymore
with projects its not about grades here
but success

strain in the germangerman relationship
der spiegel published a story today
from an unnamed east german writer about suicide in the gdr
it was prompted by a number of suicides
of east berliner artists
the latest the theater director albert jerska
jerska took his life on jan 5th
of this year after a 7year career ban
since 1977 the gdr has stopped publishing
its number of suicide cases
in that year hungary is the only european
country with a higher number
yes general we have
yes we have
general we have an informant at der spiegel
whos obtained a copy of the original article
obtained way to control things
who wrote that shit
he didnt know who the author was either
because of the typewriters font we can
you cant do anything
give me names
general i will as soon as i find something
i hope so
otherwise ill kill you myself
andrea wheres the writing expert
in conclusion the typewriter can only be
a domestic portable typewriter
more than likely it is a colibri
if the original had been in black
i could say for sure
and who has a typewriter like that
its hardly used in our republic
whats that mean whats hauser use for example
the journalist paul
uses the valentino model
but this model has
yeah yeah and wallner
uses a domestic optimal elite
georg dreyman
he writes the first draft by hand
and the final draft on a wanderer torpedo
hes never written on anything else
how big would this colibri typewriter be
its one of the smallest produced
195 x 9 x 195 cm
so not hard to smuggle in as a book
thank you you can go
goodbye comrade
gdr the secret suicide statistics
andrea put me through to captain wiesler
400pm the group is exhausted
from lots of writing
yes
wiesler have you heard about this suicide article
in der spiegel yeah
from where
hauser called dreyman and told him about it
wiesler this is extremely important
for my career and yours
did he mention anything suspicious
or do you have any ideas
i dont believe he mentioned anything
no he didnt
on the 27th a spiegel editor using a fake name
crossed the border at checkpoint bornholmer st
and stayed here for 4 hours
gregor hessenstein
the 6th division followed him
to prenzlauer berg then lost him
did he have any contact with dreyman
wouldnt i have reported that
yeah of course
this text has poet written all over it
id be surprised if im wrong
well keep your ears open
shit
get in
if an employee deceives you
theyre severely punished
yes yes they are
a woman too or no
of course
shouldnt someone who serves
a bigger man cooperate
you could say that
or maybe you should
this is where christamaria sieland gets
her illegal antipsychotic drugs
thought you ought to know
its in your division
whether you break her neck or not
ill leave that up to you
either way i dont ever want to see
her on a german stage again
now get out of here
shut the door
frau sieland come with us
to clear up this issue
come on
well
comrade sieland looks like the end of your career
thats too bad you were good
quite good
a little too short wasnt it
have a seat
so whats a nonworking actress do
please
isnt there anything i could do for you
for the state security
its a little too late for that
i know almost all our artists
i could find out a lot for you
i believe you
but that wont help you
maybe theres something else
i could do for you
something that wouldnt be
unpleasant for either of us
unfortunately youve
how should i put this
made a powerful man your enemy
thats why im more restricted than usual
is there anything that can save me
im sorry no
there is one thing
since you hang around
a lot of writers and artists
you dont happen to know anything about
an article that was in last weeks spiegel
an article about suicide
state security open the door
open up
the light in the study is on
break the door down
before he destroys the evidence
crowbar
i dont think thats necessary
whats wrong comrades
we have orders to search your apartment
heres the warrant
whatre you looking for
security matter
bols and muehler bedroom corridors
reske kitchen bathroom hallways
heiser and thomas living room study
go
what did you burn
bad texts
this is western literature no
that book was a present from margot honecker
whats the situation
everythings going to plan
nothing just some western books and newspapers
no sign of the target
were you thorough
yes sir how should we proceed
lieut colonel
get your men out
here is the address of the ministry
if somethings been damaged you can request compensation
im sure everythings fine
yes
wiesler ill be expecting you at
hohenschoenhausen tomorrow at nine
well ill say what were all thinking
it was christamaria
the stasi nabbed her
she ratted you out
it wasnt her
how do you know
you said yourself
she wasnt with you last night
she knows the hiding place
yeah she knows
if youre right
and the search does trace back to her
then shes our guardian angel
meeting lieut colonel grubitz
captain wiesler
interrogation room 76
yeah
come in
sit down
and
what was that about
what was that about
youre asking me
what do you suspect dreyman to be
hes the writer of the spiegel article
who says
come on
i dunno how you couldve
done such sloppy work and missed this
but i know youre different than that
particularly as an interrogator
so im giving you one last chance
bring me prisoner 662 immediately
are you still on the right side
yes
then dont mess it up this time
should i restrain the prisoner
shes not a prisoner shes an informant now
you can go
so youre the officer in charge
then take charge of me
10 hours left
95 actually
before herr roessing tells the audience
youre unable to be present due to an illness
and that will be the last time
the theater world talks about you
is that what you want
tell us where the evidence is
there is no evidence
there is no typewriter
i made that up
i hope not
then well have to keep you here
perjury carries with it the penalty
of at least 2 years in prison
dreyman is going to prison either way
your statement took care of that
along with the evidence weve
already found in the apartment
at least save yourself
you wouldnt believe how many people are here
because of futile heroism
think about your audience
think about your audience
hes gotta be joking
think about what the states done for you
your entire life
now you can do something for the state
it would thank you
tell me where the typewriter is
dreyman will never know
ill let you go right now
we wont go until you are there with him
you know how to act surprised
and tonight youll be back on stage
in your element
in front of your audience
tell me where the documents are
where are they
in the apartment
under the door threshold
between the living room and hallway
you can remove it
you mean here
mark the correct spot
you look a bit worn out
dont forget youre an informant now
with that come responsibilities like
conspiring secrecy but also privileges
serhabla
call wiesler for me
captain wiesler has already left lieut colonel
i see
very good
youre dismissed
whats a knight do
