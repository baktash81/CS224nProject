address him as captain 
come in 
sit down 
hands under your thighs 
palms down 
what do you have to tell us 
i haven t done anything 
i don t know anything 
you ve done nothing 
know nothing 
so you think we just
arrest innocent citizens on a whim 
no  not   
if you think our humane system
is capable of something like that 
   that d be reason enough
to arrest you 
we want to jog your memory 
prisoner 227 
your friend and neighbor
fled the republic on september 28th  
and we have reason to believe
he was helped 
i don t know anything about it 
he never told me  he wanted to leave 
i first heard about it at work 
describe what you did
on the 28th of september 
  that s already on record 
  once more please 
i took my kids to the park for a walk 
   ran into an old classmate
there  max kirchner 
   went to his place and
listened to music into the evening 
he has a phone  you can call him 
he ll corroborate everything 
i can gladly give you the number 
the enemy of our state is arrogant 
remember that 
we have to be patient with him  some 40 hours of patience 
i ll fast forward some 
i want to sleep 
please let me sleep 
hands under your thighs 
please explain again
what you did on september 28th 
please  just an hour  just a little   
just a little sleep   
tell me again what you did on this day 
why did you have to keep him
awake for so long 
i mean  that s inhumane 
an innocent prisoner becomes angrier
every hour he is kept there 
   because of the injustice done to him 
he screams and rants 
a guilty one becomes quieter 
says nothing   
   or starts to cry 
he knows that he rightly sits there 
if you want to know
whether someone is guilty or not 
   the best way is to keep asking
until they no longer can 
   classmate max kirchner 
we went to his place
   and listened to music into the evening 
he has a phone 
you can call him 
he ll corroborate everything 
anyone notice anything
about this statement 
he says pretty much
the same thing 
he says exactly the same thing 
word for word 
those who tell the truth
can paraphrase whenever 
do that as well 
a liar has particular sentences to fall back on
during states of increased stress 
227 is lying  we have 2 important indications 
and can increase the intensity 
if you don t tell me the name of the escapee s helper 
your wife will be arrested tonight   
  and your kids put into
a state reformatory 
is that what you want 
what s the helper s name 
who was it 
  glaesker 
  come again  louder 
glaesker  werner glaesker 
werner   glaesker 
quiet 
quiet 
listen 
can anyone tell me
what that is 
the preserved scent for the dogs 
it s to be removed after every interrogation 
and never left behind 
with interrogation  you are working
with enemies of socialism 
don t forget that 
have a nice day 
that was good 
that was really good 
how was it 
   when we sat here together 20 years ago 
ya know  they proposed me
for a professor job 
see  grades don t matter in the real world 
even though mine weren t too bad 
what s on your agenda 
why do you always think
i have a hidden agenda 
  i just wanted to invite you to the theater 
  the theater 
i heard that minister bruno hempf
is going to be there tonight 
i ought to attend
as head of the culture department 
it starts at 7 
we should get going 
the lives of others
minister bruno hempf 
1 o clock 
he worked for the ministry 
before he was called into the central committee 
cleaned house in those
days with the theater scene 
georg dreyman  the poet 
he s the kind of arrogant guy
i always warn my students about 
arrogant  but loyal 
if everyone were like him 
i d be jobless 
he s our only unsuspicious author
and is still read in the west 
for him  the gdr is the best
country in the world 
see for yourself 
dear child  what s wrong 
a new vision 
say something  martha  please 
your arthur   
   no longer lives 
arthur  isn t it possible
you re wrong this time 
no sisters  believe me 
he has fallen into death 
the powerful wheel has ground him up 
i see it 
   and would rather see any other horror 
why am i not spared from this vision 
elena  go home 
and  did you like it 
dreyman s good  huh 
i would have him monitored 
monitored  that teaching is
corrupting your instincts  wiesler 
i d even be the point man 
i told you he s cleaner than clean 
even hempf came to his premiere 
if you monitor someone like that 
you bite the hand that feeds 
i m going downstairs for a sec 
 faces of love 
i m hearing a lot about your work 
they say   our culture is in good hands  
your name is mentioned
often in the party 
we re  the shield and
sword of the party   minister
we re conscious of that every moment 
what do you think of him 
georg dreyman 
maybe   
maybe what 
maybe he s not   not as clean as it seems 
grubitz  that s why guys like you
and me are at the top 
the standard stasi schmuck would ve said 
he s one of our country s best  loyal  all this garbage
   but we see more 
you could make it up the ladder  grubitz 
there s something fishy about him 
i feel it in my gut  and it doesn t lie 
next week thursday is a party at dreyman s 
a few shady people are coming 
hauser and those vermin 
try and organize something by then 
   something small and discreet 
procedures a and b 
just his apartment  nothing flashy 
he has powerful friends 
no one can find out about this
until we ve found something 
and when you find something against him 
you ve got a fat friend in the central committee 
know what i mean 
minister  have a good evening 
why s he still watching 
what s he even doing here 
i think  he fancies you 
i insist on proposing the toast tonight
to our community of culture 
a famous socialist once said 
 the poet is the engineer of the soul  
and georg dreyman is one of the most
important engineers in our country 
  charming comrades 
  paul  stop that 
and of course christa maria sieland 
she is the most beautiful pearl of the gdr 
i won t accept any objections to that 
so  please raise your glasses and toast
to christa maria sieland  may you live long 
  the fact  someone like that can even address you   
  please  stay here 
and now another lively number 
may i 
  how did you like my little speech 
  thank you very much 
i liked your play as well 
really  it was good 
 engineer of the soul  
that was stalin you quoted 
oh yeah 
well  i like to provoke
every now and then  hauser 
but on the other hand 
i know how far i can take that 
in that way  i m more like
our dear dreyman 
he knows that the party needs the artist 
but the artist the party even more 
if you guys want to talk politics 
i need to find someone else to dance with 
  i m ready 
  too late  too late 
i ve been following the developments
of our theater for a while 
  didn t you follow them professionally before 
  paul 
it s fine herr dreyman 
we ve known each other for a long time 
herr schweiber 
you did a fine job tonight as well 
dreyman  i m glad you re
working with such directors now 
there were other times though   
you mean jerska 
i think you sentenced him too harshly 
of course  his statement
crossed the line  no question 
but   
   put yourself in his position for a minute 
you as a man of your word 
he can t take back his signature
from this declaration 
comrade hempf  the man could
work at any theater in the west 
but he doesn t want to leave 
because he firmly believes in socialism and this country 
  his career ban is absolute   
  who said anything about a career ban 
that doesn t exist here 
you ought to choose your words more carefully 
comrade hempf  i ll tell you this now 
my plays aren t so good 
that someone like schweiber could direct them 
i need jerska 
  and i think you sentenced him too hard   
  see here  i don t think so 
but that s what we all love about your plays 
the love of man  good people 
   believing that someone can change 
dreyman   
   no matter how often
you write that in your plays 
   people don t change 
so how s he doing anyway 
he was hoping that his career b   
   that he d be allowed to work again soon 
  can he hope 
  of course  as long as he s alive  and even longer 
as you know dreyman 
 hope is the last thing to die  
the tech team will be ready
tomorrow morning for the wiretapping 
it s important that everything s done by thursday 
it s all up to you 
can you manage that 
good night 
need to go 
otherwise  i ll get in trouble 
  by who 
  my girlfriend 
20 minutes 
yes 
frau meineke  one word to anyone   
   and your marscha loses
her acceptance to medical school 
is that understood 
yeah 
send frau meineke a thank you gift
for her secrecy 
thursday already 
time goes by too fast 
it s better so 
  how re you doing 
  not too bad 
it s not always this noisy 
i know  just on thursdays 
yeah 
  we missed you at the premiere 
  schweiber have a good epiphany 
  what was good  he stole from you 
  that s how my ideas stay alive 
don t think me evil  but i can t stand
the sight of these fat  spiffed up people at such a premiere 
that doesn t sound like me  does it 
but maybe it does after all 
maybe that wasn t the real me back then
   friendly and kind to people
off the concentrated feed of success 
   for which i m indebted
to the big shots for their mercy 
but i ll stop complaining 
in my next life i want to be a writer 
a happy writer who can write all the time 
like you 
what does a director have
if he s not allowed to direct 
nothing more than a projectionist without films 
a miller without flour  he has nothing left 
nothing left   
albert  the minister was at
the premiere too  minister hempf 
i talked to him about your ban 
it s looking good 
he gave me some hope 
was very literal  very specific 
really 
that s nice 
jerska  the wine connoisseur 
and how s our sacred drinker doing  is he coming 
i forgot to ask him 
you re vigorous and strong 
and i need you 
  don t bring this destructive cycle into your life 
  albert s my friend 
  and you re mine too 
  looks like something for a 50th birthday party 
i m turning 40 though  aren t i 
don t forget  you promised to wear
a tie for your birthday 
i would  but i don t have one 
no more excuses 
  a tie 
  you did say  you didn t want any books 
or can t you tie one after all 
you old working poet 
ya think  i can t tie a tie 
i was born with a tie 
you forget  i had to break free
of this chain of the middle class 
then chain yourself to it just once more for me 
tying a tie 
a minor detail 
frau meineke 
come here for a second 
can you tie a tie 
you can t imagine
how grateful i am 
  something wrong 
  no  i m fine 
done 
wonderful  it s perfect 
couldn t be better 
but this has to be our secret 
you can keep a secret  can t you 
yes 
gosh  i really didn t
think you could do it 
you don t beat around the bush
when it comes to what you can do 
you just didn t know
i can do almost anything 
our first guest 
our dear good neighbors
locked the door downstairs 
  can you go 
  on my way 
master  our present 
i specifically said  no books  thank you 
want something to drink 
  sure  a seltzer 
  vodka for me 
i ll get it 
what the hell 
why s albert sitting by himself 
he doesn t want to talk to us 
he just turned us away 
i brought you something too 
  did you really come here to read 
  it s brecht anyway 
i feel like an impostor
amongst all these people 
impostor  come on albert 
you re losing grip on reality 
you know we admire you 
every one admires you 
yeah  for something i did
10 years ago   
   and probably could never do again 
ah  my favorite director 
wait a sec  i need to talk to you 
man  explain to me exactly
how you got this job 
your talent  naturally  of course 
but what else did you do  hm 
every one knows 
you re with the stasi  you washout 
  that s an unbelievable allegation 
  don t forget that   
  paul 
  what 
schweiber  excuse my friend 
he s had too much to drink 
what s with you 
you know he s with the stasi 
no  paul 
i don t know that 
you re such a miserable idealist 
you re almost some big shot 
who do you think messed up jerska so bad 
people like that 
narks  traitors and conformers 
you have to pick a side sometime 
otherwise you re not a person 
if you want to do something about it  then call me 
otherwise we don t need to see each other anymore 
  your friends don t have much taste  do they 
  that s really unfair 
the back scratcher  for example 
it s wonderful 
that s a salad fork 
never the less 
wonderful 
check this out 
i ll write my next play with this 
you don t have any taste either 
for some things i do 
  from jerska 
  probably gave you a book 
 the sonata of good men 
11 04 pm   lazlo  and cms unwrapped gifts 
afterwards prob  sexual intercourse 
you re late 
excuse me  captain  i got stuck at a red light 
can easily lose 4 minutes there 
you know how it is 
already at it  eh  i don t believe it 
these artists  they ve got it going on 
ya know colleague  that s why i
monitor artists instead of priests or peacekeepers 
see you tomorrow at 11am 
albert jerska  the  engerling  file 
wiesler  systematic as usual 
take your jacket off 
let s get some lunch 
 volleyball game at 7pm tonight  
you haven t been here for a while 
the officer s table is over here 
socialism has to start somewhere 
to your question about the limo
that brought frau sieland home the other night   
it s minister hempf s car 
wiesler  we re not allowed to record senior comrades 
i deleted the citation from your report 
next time there s something like this 
report it to me verbally in person 
we re helping our committee member
get rid of his rival 
in light of this new information 
i don t need to say what that means for my career 
and for yours 
if we do find something 
is that why we enlisted 
remember what we swore 
  to be  the shield and sword of the party  
  and what s the party other than its members 
if they ve got a lot of influence 
all the better 
i ve got a new one 
so  honecker comes into his office
in the morning
   opens the window  looks at the sun 
and says   
   uh  what s wrong 
oh excuse me 
that was   i m just   i   
no  please colleague  we can still
laugh about our state officials  don t worry 
i probably know it already anyway 
come on  tell it 
well  honecker 
i mean  the general secretary
   sees the sun and says 
 good morning  dear sun  
 good morning  dear sun  
and the sun answered 
 good morning  dear erich  
at noon erich sees it again
and says   good day  dear sun  
and the sun said   good day  dear erich  
after work honecker goes back to the window
and says   good evening  dear sun  
but the sun doesn t answer 
so he says again 
 good evening  dear sun  what s wrong  
and the sun answers 
 oh kiss my ass  i m in the west now  
name 
rank 
department

stiegler 
2nd lieut  axel stiegler 
department m 
don t think i need to say what that
means for your career  what you just did 
please   lieutenant colonel   i just   
you just mocked our party 
that was political agitation 
surely just the tip of the iceberg 
i m going to report this
to the minister s office 
i was just kidding 
pretty good  huh 
your s was good too 
but i ve got a better one 
what s the difference between
erich honecker and a telephone

bye 
georg  did you heard about hauser 
no  what about him 
his lecture tour in the west was cancelled 
he didn t get a travel permit 
are you surprised 
if he s going to act so arrogant 
he ought to expect something like this to happen 
would you allow him to travel 
if you were in their shoes 
  lazlo  supports hauser s travel abroad ban  
  have you seen my yellow volume of brecht 
  what 
my brecht volume 
don t know where it is 
weird  i can t find it 
 on that day in blue mooned september 
quiet under a young plum tree  
 i held her there  that silent pale love 
in my arms like a graceful dream  
 and above us in the summer sky 
was a cloud i saw for a time  
 on top it was white and tremendous 
and as i looked up  there was not but one sign  
  yes 
  georg  this is wallner 
what is it 
georg  it s about jerska 
he s dead 
he hanged himself last night 
georg 
i m gonna hang up  ok 
i m thinking about what
lenin said about beethoven s  appassionata  
 i can t listen to it 
otherwise i won t be able to finish the revolution  
can someone who s
listened to this music
   really listened
   still be a bad person 
do you really work for the stasi 
do you know what that is  the stasi 
yes  my dad says they re
bad men who lock people up 
i see 
what s the name of your    
my what 
your ball 
what s your ball s name 
you re weird 
balls don t have names 
everything is happening  minister 
state of the art technology
   under every light switch 
even in the john 
  the foyer is being monitored per procedure c   
  you said  you d find something 
find something already 
i wouldn t want my worst enemy
to disappoint me 
get out of here 
nowack  you re going to monitor christa maria 
report every minute she s not
with me  understood 
we banned hauser s travel permit 
maybe that ll get something going 
those two are pretty close 
how s it going between
cms and the minister 
they re meeting tomorrow night 
if i understand their rhythm 
good  the both of us have a lot
to gain from their love story 
or a lot to lose 
don t forget that 
in the past 
i was scared of only 2 things 
being alone and not being able to write 
since albert s death 
i don t care about writing 
or other people 
now i m just afraid of being without you 
don t be scared of losing me tonight 
  i m just going out for an hour 
  where 
i m meeting up with a classmate 
really christa 
  really 
  what are you getting at 
i know 
i know where you want to go 
and i m asking you  don t go 
you don t need him 
you don t need him 
i know about the pills  too 
and how little you trust your art 
at least trust me 
christa maria   
you are a great artist 
i know it 
and your audience knows it too 
you don t need him 
you don t need him 
stay here 
don t go to him 
no  i don t need him 
don t need this scandalous system 
what about you 
you don t need it either 
even less than i do 
but you re in bed with him too 
why 
because they can destroy you too 
despite your talent you haven t doubted yet 
because they decide
who can act and direct 
you don t want to end up like jerska 
and i don t want that either 
and that s why i m going 
you re right about many things 
i want to do things differently 
but i m asking you 
i m begging you  don t go 
so boss  on time 
lemme guess
what they re up to 
come on  i ll take over 
i can t be held responsible
for you doing overtime because of me 
 don t go through this door  
where s she off to 
meeting an old schoolmate 
you can read the detailed report tomorrow 
i ll take care of it 
good night 
what re you staring at 
seltzer 
no  uh  vodka 
a double 
another shot 
bring me a cognac  please 
ma am 
please let me be 
i want to be alone 
frau sieland 
do we know each other 
you don t know me 
but i know you 
a lot of people love you   
   because you are how you are 
  acting isn t real 
  with you it is 
i ve seen you on stage 
you were more yourself then  than   
   than how you are now 
so  you know how i am 
i am your audience 
  i have to go 
  where are you going 
i m meeting an old schoolmate  i   
you see  you weren t
yourself at all just then 
no 
no 
you know this christa maria sieland well 
what do you think 
would she hurt someone who completely loves her 
would she sell herself for the art 
sell herself for art 
but she has the art already 
that d be terrible business 
you are a great artist 
don t you know that 
and you are a good person 
 as i took over   lazlo  and cms were arguing
about whether cms should meet her schoolmate     
 finally she went 
 lazlo  seemed unhappy about this  
 after about 20 minutes 
cms returned to  lazlo     
    to his and my surprise  
 he seemed quite happy 
fervid intimacy ensued  
 she said  she d never leave again  
 he said repeatedly   i have the strength now 
i will do something  
 here it is assumed 
he will write a new play  
  lazlo s  play production has been plagued
with difficulty over the last few weeks 
 what her comment means is uncertain  
 perhaps she wants to take care
of  lazlo s  household now more than before  
 the rest of the night was peaceful  
captain   
i was just  uh   
good report 
really 
i didn t know he was doing so badly 
me either 
 from someone who s crossed over  
the state s head office for statistics on hans beimler st 
   counts everything  knows everything 
how many shoes i buy per year  2 3 
   how many books i read in a year  3 2 
   and how many students graduate
every year with an 4 0 gpa  6 347 
but there is one number not registered 
   perhaps because such a figure
hurts even the bureaucrats  suicides 
if you called the beimler st  office and asked 
 how many people between the elbe
and oder rivers  
    between the baltic sea and
ore mnts  were driven to death from desperation  
then our oracle of numbers remains silent 
   and probably writes down
your full name
   for the state security 
   those grey men who take care
of our country s security and happiness 
since 1977 our country has ceased
counting cases of suicide 
 murdering oneself  
that s what they call it 
this act has nothing to do with murder 
it knows no bloodlust 
it knows no passion 
it only knows dying 
the dying of hope 
9 years ago  when we stopped counting suicides 
only one european country had a higher suicide rate 
hungary 
after them was us 
the country of the living breathing socialism 
one of these uncounted is albert jerska 
   the great director 
today  i d like to talk about him 
  i m trying to get some stats on   
     how much more effective our
state s security works  as is generally believed 
stupid me  i practiced my lecture for the tour here 
since then i ve taken quite a taste in music 
should we meet at my place 
 3pm  ehrenmal pankow 
is this safe enough 
my own personal bodyguard 
i call him rolf  that s probably his name too 
shoot 
here 
you want to publish this 
in the west  with your help 
will you help me 
have you told christa about this 
no 
good  i ll help you
   under the condition you
continue to keep it a secret 
what 
georg  it s for her protection 
this is something for  der spiegel  magazine 
i m good friends with one of the directors 
gregor hessenstein  you know him 
  not personally 
  you need to meet him 
but publishing under your name
is out of the question 
unless an intensive
48 hour interrogation sounds appealing 
man  it s cold 
so  to my place after all 
there are no stasi watching me 
may i remind you  i m a personal friend of
margot honecker and a national prize winner 
2nd class winner 
i m telling you guys  my place s clean 
well  if we could somehow be sure   
i had an idea how we could check your apartment 
you guys know my uncle frank visits every saturday
from west berlin with his slick gold mercedes 
for herr hauser 
this seems pretty risky 
yeah  georg s right 
just dismantling the back seat and
hiding your nephew underneath 
i don t know 
i just don t know 
believe me fellas 
they won t look under there 
quick glance under the axle 
knock on the exhaust pipe and that s it  i m over  paul too 
they certainly aren t the brightest on the border 
you guys have that all wrong 
  which border crossing are you taking 
  heinrich heine street

the guys know me there  me and my gold benz 
i m good friends with the border patrol 
believe me  i ll call in 2 hours
with a bottle of schultheiss in hand
   and give you guys the good message 
paul is over 
what s up with paul s stasi guy 
rolf  rolfy   
he thinks pauly s at home 
alright  i gotta go 
otherwise the boy s gonna suffocate in the car 
then he d really be in trouble  wouldn t he 
want another beer 
checkpoint heinrich heine street 
subscriber 
subscriber 
whatever 
just this once  friend 
  dreyman 
  ok  as promised   paul is over  
no checks  nothing 
naw  nothing out of the ordinary 
those guys aren t that bad 
  so  he s over 
  thank you for doing this for us 
don t mention it 
it wasn t all that dangerous 
yeah  i guess not 
  yeah good  then thank you  see ya 
  later 
what do we say 
if someone asks what we re doing together 
we ll say   
we ll say you re helping me
write a play 
for the 40th anniversary of the gdr 
yeah 
that s sort of right 
who would ve thought
our state s security is so inept 
who d of thought such idiots even exist 
just wait 
 7 32pm  no further noteworthy incidents  
hi captain 
listen to this for a sec 
for those in the west  we know why the rate
was the highest in  67 
but in 1977  you need to explain that 
clarify the social conditions 
it ought to still be a literary piece 
not a journalistic inflammatory pamphlet 
the article is great the way it is 
i just want to make sure
that it ll be properly understood on our end 
it s going to create a stir either way 
  that s hauser 
  of course that s hauser 
then he s not in the wes   
they re writing a play together 
for the 40th anniversary 
well  it doesn t sound like a play to me 
what does it sound like to you 
i dunno  but not a play 
you think quite a bit  1st sergeant leier 
are you an intellectual 
me  no  that s not me 
then don t act like one 
i chose you for this assignment
for your technical skills  not for asking questions 
let your superiors do the thinking 
sorry captain  i ll just   uh   
have a good day  uh great day 
good work  i mean   good luck with the work 
i can probably rewrite this 
i ll send you then
what we have on the subjects 
two weeks  can you handle that 
then i can possibly get it
into the first march issue  maybe even the cover 
that s christa 
georg 
christa  this is gregor hessenstein 
  christa sieland 
  yes  i know 
so what re you guys conspiring to do 
hauser and i wanted to write a play
together for the republic s 40th anniversary 
written by 2 people 
 der spiegel  might do a report on it  maybe 
  and who s playing the main lead 
  we actually wanted to ask you that 
christa  which role would you rather have 
lenin or his dear old mother 
you can choose 
well i can see i m not wanted here 
i m gonna take a nap 
i commend your caution 
the less people that know about this project  the better 
the stasi aren t people you want to trifle with 
with that in mind 
i brought you something 
i would ve preferred the torte 
  i already have a typewriter 
  one that s been documented by the stasi 
if this text is written with your typewriter
and intercepted at the border 
   then you ll be thrown into
hohenschoenhausen the next day 
and that wouldn t be too swell 
paul can attest that  huh 
unfortunately all i have in this mini format is red 
that bother you 
writing the article in red 
shouldn t be a problem 
you have a place to hide
the typewriter after using it 
  i m sure i ll come up with something 
  don t treat this lightly 
i don t want the next article to be 
 where s georg dreyman gone to  
no one other than us knows
this typewriter even exists 
is the apartment really secure 
yeah 
this apartment is the last place in the gdr 
where i can say what i want unpunished 
good  then let s drink to that 
the bottle is real 
cheers to you  for showing all of germany
the true face of the gdr 
cheers  this is better than the russian stuff 
here s to a great success 
i need to see comrade grubitz 
it s urgent 
i m sorry  but the earliest available
time is tomorrow at 2 30   
if our informant s exposed 
then we ll get rid of the congregation  close the whole church 
it s as simple as that 
he ought to call the pope
and complain to him 
now that s enough 
i ve had enough of this nonsense 
wiesler  glad you re here 
gotta show you something 
 terms of imprisonment for political ideological dissidents
of the art scene  according to personality profiles 
pretty academic  huh 
check this out 
disseration advised by professor anton grubitz 
how do ya like that 
i gave them a b  they shouldn t think that
earning their doctorate is easy with me 
   but this is really great work 
did you know for example
there are only 5 kinds of artists 
for example  dreyman 
he s type 4  hysterical anthropocentric 
can t be alone  always has to talk 
have friends around 
you wouldn t want to put someone
like this on trial  he d flourish there 
everything has to be done by the book  outside the public eye 
we re done with him quicker that way 
complete isolation without telling him
how long he ll be there 
no contact with anyone 
not even with the guards 
best way to deal with him 
no persecution  maltreatment or scandals 
nothing he could write about later 
after 10 months  we let him go 
to his surprise 
doesn t give us any more trouble 
you know what the best part is 
most of these type 4s we dealt with
don t write any more 
   or paint  or whatever it is artists do 
and that s without us pressuring them 
it s just   
   so to speak
   their fate 
what did you want 
any developments from dreyman 
i wanted to talk to you about that 
i think it s time   
time for what 
   that we make the operation smaller 
i don t think day and night shifts
are required for such an uncertain case 
uncertain  huh 
so  you don t think we ll find
anything for the minister 
maybe if the operation were
smaller and more mobile 
   if we could find out some things about  lazlo 
outside of his apartment 
should i give udo the case 
i d rather take it myself 
why 
might still find something 
i need to be able to   
   come and go as i please
during the day  at night 
maybe he s doing something
outside his apartment 
something about this bothers me 
you re not telling me something 
fine  i ll pull udo out 
i could actually use him in this church case 
file the request with me
in writing 
   and give  lack of suspicious facts 
as your reasoning 
and wiesler 
a piece of advice 
we re not in school anymore 
with projects  it s not about grades here 
   but success 
   on hans beimler st 
counts everything  knows everything 
how many shoes i buy per year  2 3 
   how many books i read in a year  3 2 
   and how many students graduate
every year with an 4 0 gpa  6 347   
 5 00pm   lazlo  read the first act of the
anniversary play to hauser and wallner  
 dentist office 
  we re not writing a play  christa 
  you don t have to tell me 
  but i want to  it s a piece about   
  you don t have to 
maybe i m as undependable
as your friends say 
i m on your side 
no matter what 
strain in the german german relationship 
 der spiegel  published a story today
from an unnamed east german writer about suicide in the gdr 
it was prompted by a number of suicides
of east berliner artists 
   the latest  the theater director albert jerska 
jerska took his life on jan  5th
of this year after a 7 year career ban 
since 1977  the gdr has stopped publishing
its number of suicide cases 
in that year  hungary is the only european
country with a higher number 
yes general  we have   
yes  we have   
general  we have an informant at  der spiegel 
who s obtained a copy of the original article 
  obtained   way to control things 
who wrote that shit 
he didn t know who the author was either 
because of the typewriter s font  we can   
  you can t do anything 
give me names 
general  i will as soon as i find something 
  i hope so 
otherwise  i ll kill you myself 
andrea  where s the writing expert 
in conclusion  the typewriter can only be
a domestic portable typewriter 
more than likely  it is a colibri 
if the original had been in black 
i could say for sure 
  and who has a typewriter like that 
  it s hardly used in our republic 
what s that mean  what s hauser use  for example 
the journalist paul
uses the valentino model 
  but this model has   
  yeah  yeah  and wallner 
uses a domestic optimal elite 
  georg dreyman 
  he writes the first draft by hand
   and the final draft on a wanderer torpedo 
he s never written on anything else 
how big would this colibri typewriter be 
it s one of the smallest produced 
19 5 x 9 x 19 5 cm
so  not hard to smuggle in as a book 
thank you  you can go 
goodbye  comrade 
gdr  the secret suicide statistics
andrea  put me through to captain wiesler 
 4 00pm  the group is exhausted
from lots of writing  
  yes 
  wiesler  have you heard about this suicide article 
in  der spiegel   yeah 
from where 
hauser called dreyman and told him about it 
  wiesler  this is extremely important
for my career and yours 
did he mention anything suspicious 
or do you have any ideas 
i don t believe he mentioned anything 
no he didn t 
on the 27th  a  spiegel  editor using a fake name
crossed the border at checkpoint bornholmer st 
   and stayed here for 4 hours 
gregor hessenstein 
the 6th division followed him
to prenzlauer berg  then lost him 
did he have any contact with dreyman 
  wouldn t i have reported that 
  yeah  of course 
this text has  poet  written all over it 
i d be surprised if i m wrong 
well  keep your ears open 
shit 
get in 
if an employee deceives you 
they re severely punished 
yes  yes they are 
a woman too  or no 
of course 
shouldn t someone who serves
a bigger man cooperate 
you could say that 
or maybe you should 
this is where christa maria sieland gets
her illegal antipsychotic drugs 
thought you ought to know 
it s in your division 
whether you break her neck or not 
i ll leave that up to you 
either way  i don t ever want to see
her on a german stage again 
now get out of here 
shut the door 
frau sieland  come with us
to clear up this issue 
come on 
well   
comrade sieland  looks like the end of your career 
that s too bad  you were good 
quite good 
a little too short  wasn t it 
have a seat 
so what s a non working actress do 
please 
isn t there anything i could do for you 
  for the state security 
  it s a little too late for that 
i know almost all our artists 
i could find out a lot for you 
i believe you
but that won t help you 
maybe there s something else
i could do for you
   something that wouldn t be
unpleasant for either of us 
unfortunately you ve   
how should i put this 
made a powerful man your enemy 
that s why i m more restricted than usual 
is there anything that can save me 
i m sorry  no 
there is one thing   
   since you hang around
a lot of writers and artists 
you don t happen to know anything about
an article that was in last week s  spiegel  
an article about suicide 
state security  open the door 
open up 
the light in the study is on 
break the door down
before he destroys the evidence 
crowbar 
i don t think that s necessary 
  what s wrong comrades 
  we have orders to search your apartment 
here s the warrant 
  what re you looking for 
  security matter 
bols and muehler  bedroom  corridors
reske  kitchen  bathroom  hallways 
heiser and thomas  living room  study 
go 
what did you burn 
bad texts 
this is western literature  no 
that book was a present from margot honecker 
  what s the situation 
  everything s going to plan 
nothing  just some western books and newspapers 
  no sign of the target 
  were you thorough 
yes sir  how should we proceed 
  lieut  colonel 
  get your men out 
here is the address of the ministry 
if something s been damaged  you can request compensation 
i m sure everything s fine 
yes 
wiesler  i ll be expecting you at
hohenschoenhausen tomorrow at nine 
well  i ll say what we re all thinking 
it was christa maria 
the stasi nabbed her 
she ratted you out 
it wasn t her 
how do you know 
you said yourself 
she wasn t with you last night 
she knows the hiding place 
yeah  she knows 
if you re right 
and the search does trace back to her 
   then she s our guardian angel 
meeting lieut  colonel grubitz 
captain wiesler 
interrogation room  76
yeah 
come in 
sit down 
and 
what was that about 
 what was that about  
you re asking me  
what do you suspect dreyman to be 
he s the writer of the  spiegel  article 
who says 
come on 
i dunno how you could ve
done such sloppy work and missed this 
   but i know you re different than that 
particularly as an interrogator 
so i m giving you one last chance 
bring me prisoner 662  immediately 
are you still on the right side 
  yes 
  then don t mess it up this time 
should i restrain the prisoner 
she s not a prisoner  she s an informant now 
you can go 
so you re the officer in charge 
then take charge of me 
10 hours left 
9 5 actually   
   before herr roessing tells the audience 
you re unable to be present due to an illness 
and that will be the last time
the theater world talks about you 
is that what you want 
tell us where the evidence is 
there is no evidence 
there is no typewriter 
i made that up 
i hope not 
then we ll have to keep you here 
perjury carries with it the penalty
of at least 2 years in prison 
dreyman is going to prison either way 
your statement took care of that
   along with the evidence we ve
already found in the apartment 
at least save yourself 
you wouldn t believe how many people are here
because of futile heroism 
think about your audience 
 think about your audience  
he s gotta be joking 
think about what the state s done for you
   your entire life 
now you can do something for the state 
it would thank you 
tell me where the typewriter is 
dreyman will never know 
i ll let you go right now 
we won t go until you are there with him 
you know how to act surprised 
and tonight you ll be back on stage   
   in your element
   in front of your audience 
tell me where the documents are 
where are they 
in the apartment 
under the door threshold 
between the living room and hallway 
you can remove it 
you mean here 
mark the correct spot 
you look a bit worn out 
don t forget  you re an informant now 
with that come responsibilities like
conspiring  secrecy  but also privileges 
serhabla 
call wiesler for me 
captain wiesler has already left  lieut  colonel 
i see 
very good 
you re dismissed 
what s a knight do 
when he s thrown off his horse 
he gets back on 
go in and sleep it off 
what happened has nothing
to do with your home situation 
no  but with the entire country 
christa 
don t come near me  i was at karschner s
and there wasn t any water  i need a shower 
  you left pretty fast 
  well  the  lazlo  case is still going on

state security  open the door 
stay here 
hello comrade dreyman 
lieut  colonel  grubitz from the state security 
just wanted to make sure
last night s job was neatly carried out 
the study  we ll go in there 
look through every book 
page by page 
well what do we have here 
this threshold doesn t look
too kosher to me 
could this be a secret compartment 
leave her 
she s not a suspect 
that actress 
i was too weak 
i can never make right what i ve done 
nothing needs to be made right 
understand  nothing 
i have the typewrit   
forgive me  forgive me   
take your men back to headquarters 
the mission is over 
comrade dreyman  i called the search off 
we received bad information
i m sorry 
come on 
don t delude yourself  wiesler 
your career is over   
   even if you were smart enough
to cover your tracks 
at most you ll be stuck in some cellar hole
opening mail until you re retired 
that s in 20 years 
20 years 
that s a long time

invested in you 
but i basically get you  dreyman 
what s there to write about
in this federal republic 
nothing to believe in any more 
to rebel against 
it was nice in our little republic 
people understand that now 
  one thing i have to ask you 
  anything  dear dreyman  anything 
why wasn t i ever bugged 
you monitored everyone 
why not me 
you were completely monitored 
we knew everything about you 
i was completely monitored 
completely bugged 
the whole program 
that s impossible 
when you have a chance 
look behind the light switches 
knew everything   
we even knew that you couldn t really
give our little christa what she needed
