and the orange groves
stretch as far as the eye can see
there are jobs aplenty land is cheap
every workingman can have his own house
and inside every house
a happy allamerican family
you can have all this
and who knows
you could even be discovered
become a movie star
or at least see one
life is good in los angeles

theyre selling it through movies
radio and television
in the hit show badge of honor
the la cops walk on water

mickey c to his fans
local la color to the nth degree
and his number one bodyguard
johnny stompanato
mickey cs the head
of organized crime in these parts
he runs dope rackets and prostitution
he kills a dozen people a year
and the dapper little gent
does it in style
and every time his pictures
on the front page
its a black eye
for the image of los angeles
because how can organized crime exist
in the city with the best
police force in the world
something has to be done
but nothing too original
because hey this is hollywood
what worked for al capone
would work for the mickster
mr cohen youre under arrest
nonpayment of federal income tax
but all is not well
sending mickey up has created a vacuum
and its only a matter of time
before someone

whatll it be then
patrol division
internal affairs what
i was thinking
detective bureau
edmund
youre a political animal
you have the eye for human weakness
but not the stomach
youre wrong sir
would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty
in order to insure an indictment
weve been over this
yes or no
no
would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty
would you shoot
a hardened criminal in the back
in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer
then for the love of god
dont be a detective
work where you dont have
to make those kind of choices
dudley i know you mean well
but i dont need to do it
the way you didor my father
at least get rid of the glasses
i cant think of a man

get back get back
yeah and fuck your mother
fuck you
stop officer
thats an order
youll all be in my report
bloody christmas
the press love to label
you should know this is bigger
than the police board
the grand jurys convening
indictments may be handed down
will you testify
no sir i wont
district attorney loew
you and officer stensland
brought the liquor to the station
stensland was already drunk
appearing as a
voluntary witness against him
could offset damage to yourself
i wont testify against him
or anyone else
this man is a disgrace
your badge and gun officer
youre suspended from duty
dismissed
we need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the department
justice has to be served
of course ill testify
im glad you feel that way edmund
most dont
they think silence and integrity
are the same thing
not exactly the image of the
new lapd were trying to create
welcome to los angeles
the city of the future
may i make a suggestion sir
by all means
the public will expect the department
to sweep this under the carpet
dont
shift the guilt to men
whose pensions are secured
force them to retire
but somebody has to swing
so indict try and convict
richard stensland and bud white
secure them jail time
the message will be clear
this department
will not tolerate officers
who think theyre above the law
dick stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman
hes had rotten fitness reports
from every co hes served under
but bud white is a valuable officer
whites a mindless thug
no edmund
but he can answer yes to those
questions ive asked you before
the department and the public
need role models
cleancut forthright men
the public can admire
sergeant
ill promote you
to lieutenant
effective immediately
detective lieutenant
ed youre 30
your father didnt make lieutenant
till he was 33
i know that sir when he made
lieutenant it was as a detective
before we start polishing our laurels
itd look better if we had
a corroborative witness
that wont be easy to come by
the men hate a stool pigeon
jack vincennes
he hit one of the mexicans
a veteran like vincennes might be
willing to admit his own culpability
but hed never rat out
a fellow officer
jacks the technical advisor
on badge of honor
he lives for it
thats how to get to him
id like you to observe ed
call sergeant vincennes
bright kid
you may reap the benefit
but are you ready to be despised
in the department
yes sir i am
so be it
sergeant well get right to it
nine civilian witnesses have identified
you as hitting ezekiel garcia
but we have a witness who will name
names and testify that you hit back
only after being hit
you will testify against 3 officers
who have earned their pensions
and plead ignorance about the rest
no thanks
im not a snitch
ill guarantee you a slap on the wrist
a brief suspension
followed by a temporary transfer
from narcotics to vice
you transfer out of vice
youll be back on the show
the show
badge of honor vincennes
we need to tone down
your profile for a bit
i doubt youve ever taken
a stupid breath dont start now
okay ill do it
the grand jury will hear
your testimony tomorrow
and so it goes
detective lieutenant
ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow son
wear a smartlooking suit
and ace them
and ed
lose the glasses
so youre the stellar witness
i should have known
whats the chief throwing you
throwing me
yeah exley whats the payoff
youre the payoff expert
im just doing my duty
come on youre playing
an angle here college boy
youll get something so you
dont have to hobnob with the cops
wholl hate you for snitching
if theyre making you detective
watch out
some bureau guys will burn in this and
youll be working with their friends
what about you
im snitching 3 oldtimers wholl be
fishing in oregon next week
next to you im clean
and smart
edmund j exley to chambers
and remember
bud white will fuck you for this
if it takes the rest of his life
captain what do you want
call me dudley
dudley
what do you want
look lad i admire
your refusal to testify
and your loyalty to your partner
i admire you as a policeman
and your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job
im impressed with your
punishment of womenbeaters
do you hate them wendell
what do you want
theyre yours
take them
theres no bill on me
4 witnesses recanted their testimony
why
they had a change of heart
stensland
your partners through
scapegoat on the chiefs orders
a year from his pension
exley
exley got what he wanted
as a politician he exceeds even myself
the department needs
smart men like exley
and direct men
like you
look i need you for an assignment
the chiefs given me
a duty few men are fit for
but you were born for
youd be working
out of homicide at city hall
homicide
working cases
your talents lie elsewhere wendell
its a muscle job
youll do as i say and ask no questions
do you follow my drift
in technicolor sir
meet tony brancato
and anthony trombino
two rising lieutenants
in the mickey cohen rackets
with the dapper little gent in prison
who knows how far theyll go
the skys the limit
oh well
meet deuce perkins
mickey cohens narcotics lieutenant
could he be behind the hits
is he consolidating
organized crime power
i suppose not
one things for sure
2man triggers are punching the tickets
on the micksters muscle
meanwhile rumor has it the lapd
has set up a notsowelcome wagon
to dishearten the criminal element
from filling the void left by
mickeys absence
when i know more dear readers
so will you

hushhush

ill make you my secondincommand
captain over here please
the cook drew a gun and set it off
the rest died in the mens room
sir
we got a total of 15 spent
12gauge remington shotgun shells
im betting 3 men 5shot capacity
pumps all of them emptying once
excuse me we got an id
on one of the victims
its dick stensland
at first i thought
she was rita hayworth
yeah me too
hell of a way to avoid prison
what happened
appears 3 men held up a coffee shop
the guy at the register pulled a 38
so they killed him
then they killed everyone else
lieutenant were ready
with that nite owl id
is this your daughter
i dont know
we know this is difficult
take your time
it seems like my susan
but my susan was a blonde
not a redhead
when was the last time you saw her
just before christmas
wed fought
i didnt like her boyfriend
mrs lefferts
does your daughter have
any distinguishing marks
you got the wrong idea mister
im fine
she has a birthmark on her hip
its her
my baby
im sorry mrs lefferts
whos in charge of this investigation
captain smith and myself
why
the nite owl massacre
hyperbole aside
this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution
six victims
one of them one of our own
dick stensland
he was a nite owl regular
in the wrong place at the wrong time
robbery is the likely motive
we have rubber glove smears
on the register and forensics
tend toward a trio of shooters
we do have one hot lead
three negro juveniles
were seen discharging shotguns
in griffith park
a park ranger idd them
as driving a 19481950 mercury coupe
maroon in color
an hour ago a canvassing crew
found a news vendor
who saw a maroon merc coupe
parked by the nite owl at 1 am
dmv has come up with
a registration list of merc coupes
48 twoman teams will shake
three names apiece
interrogations will be led by
lt edmund exley
enough on that
gentlemen just go out and get them
use all necessary force
the people of los angeles demand it
dismissed
why not just put a bounty on them
ready to roll
you take them i got something to do
what if one of these names
get somebody else
i got our assignments big v
we go by this list we got
zero chance of making this collar
i got a guy who knows what happens south
of jefferson hell put us at 5050
what are you doing
its the same sort of thing
that got you in trouble before
ill take those odds
we got it from here
you two should
bring along a photographer
i need an address on a customer
of yours her name is lynn
thats all i got to go on
yeah
you already know who i mean
so cough it up
theres a billing address

buzz meeks no longer works for me
lefferts looked beatup christmas eve
but didnt act it why
i think shed been hit in the face
with a tennis racket she iswas
a big doubles fan
youre a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder
want to go downtown to discuss this
is this official
somehow i have the feeling
this is more personal with you
all right then
are you concerned about criminal
matters peripheral to the murders
not at the moment
youre not obligated to report them
why were lefferts eyes black
i needed a rita hayworth
to fill out my little studio
what little studio
well theres gardner russell
monroe turner
lynn bracken is my veronica lake
i use girls that look like movie stars
sometimes i employ a plastic surgeon
when the work was done
thats when you saw us
its why her mom couldnt id her
jesus fucking christ
no pierce morehouse patchett
i sense youre on your best behavior
but thats all im saying
if you persist
well meet with my attorney
would you like lynn brackens address
i got her address
find susans killer mr white
ill give you a handsome reward
whatever you desire
i know youre not asleep
what do you want
my 5 bucks

what kind of question is that
do you know why pierce is humoring you
use words like that
you might make me mad
but do you know
yeah i know
patchetts running whores
cut to look like movie stars
and judging by his address
something bigger on the side
he doesnt want any attention
thats right our motives are selfish
so were cooperating

susan lefferts at the nite owl

youre the first man in years who didnt
tell me i look like veronica lake

pierce patchett
he takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us
he doesnt let us use narcotics
and he doesnt abuse us
