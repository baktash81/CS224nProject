and the orange groves
stretch as far as the eye can see 
there are jobs aplenty  land is cheap 
every workingman can have his own house 
and inside every house 
a happy all american family 
you can have all this 
and who knows 
you could even be discovered   
   become a movie star 
or at least see one 
life is good in los angeles 
it s paradise on earth 
that s what they tell you  anyway 
because they re selling an image 
they re selling it through movies 
radio and television 
in the hit show  badge of honor 
the l a  cops walk on water   
   as they keep the city
clean of crooks 
you d think this place
was the garden of eden 
but there s trouble in paradise   
   and his name is meyer harris cohen 
mickey c  to his fans 
local l a  color to the nth degree 
and his number one bodyguard   
   johnny stompanato 
mickey c s the head
of organized crime in these parts 
he runs dope  rackets and prostitution 
he kills a dozen people a year 
and the dapper little gent
does it in style 
and every time his picture s
on the front page   
   it s a black eye
for the image of los angeles 
because how can organized crime exist   
   in the city with the best
police force in the world 
something has to be done 
but nothing too original 
because  hey  this is hollywood 
what worked for al capone
would work for the mickster 
mr  cohen  you re under arrest 
nonpayment of federal income tax 
but all is not well 
sending mickey up has created a vacuum 
and it s only a matter of time   
   before someone
with balls of brass tries to fill it 
 remember  dear readers   
   you heard it here first   
   off the record   
   on the q t   
   and very   
   hush hush

patrol division 
internal affairs  what 
i was thinking
detective bureau 
edmund   
   you re a political animal 
you have the eye for human weakness 
but not the stomach 
you re wrong  sir 
would you be willing to plant evidence
on a suspect you knew to be guilty   
   in order to insure an indictment 
 we ve been over this 
 yes or no 
no 
would you beat a confession
out of a suspect you knew to be guilty 
would you shoot
a hardened criminal in the back   
   in order to offset the chance
that some lawyer  
then for the love of god   
   don t be a detective 
work where you don t have
to make those kind of choices 
dudley  i know you mean well   
   but i don t need to do it
the way you did   or my father 
at least get rid of the glasses 
i can t think of a man
on the bureau who wears them 
if i get held up

stens  you guys hear what those taco
benders did to helenowski and brown 
helenowski lost an eye  and they re

get back  get back 
yeah  and fuck your mother 
fuck you 
stop  officer 
that s an order 
you ll all be in my report 
 bloody christmas  
the press love to label 
you should know this is bigger
than the police board 
the grand jury s convening 
indictments may be handed down 
will you testify 
no  sir  i won t 
district attorney loew 
you and officer stensland
brought the liquor to the station 
stensland was already drunk 
appearing as a
voluntary witness against him   
   could offset damage to yourself 
i won t testify against him 
or anyone else 
this man is a disgrace 
your badge and gun  officer 
you re suspended from duty 
dismissed 
we need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the department 
justice has to be served 
of course i ll testify 
i m glad you feel that way  edmund 
most don t 
they think silence and integrity
are the same thing 
not exactly the image of the   
   new lapd we re trying to create 
welcome to los angeles 
the city of the future 
 may i make a suggestion  sir 
 by all means 
the public will expect the department
to sweep this under the carpet 
don t 
shift the guilt to men
whose pensions are secured 
force them to retire 
but somebody has to swing 
so indict  try and convict   
   richard stensland and bud white 
secure them jail time 
the message will be clear 
this department   
   will not tolerate officers
who think they re above the law 
dick stensland is an embarrassment
as a policeman 
he s had rotten fitness reports
from every c o  he s served under 
but bud white is a valuable officer 
white s a mindless thug 
no  edmund   
   but he can answer  yes  to those
questions i ve asked you before 
the department and the public
need role models 
clean cut  forthright men
the public can admire 
sergeant   
   i ll promote you   
   to lieutenant   
   effective immediately 
detective lieutenant 
ed  you re 30 
your father didn t make lieutenant
till he was 33 
i know that  sir  when he made
lieutenant  it was as a detective 
before we start polishing our laurels   
   it d look better if we had
a corroborative witness 
that won t be easy to come by 
the men hate a stool pigeon 
jack vincennes 
he hit one of the mexicans 
a veteran like vincennes might be
willing to admit his own culpability   
   but he d never rat out
a fellow officer 
jack s the technical advisor
on badge of honor 
he lives for it 
that s how to get to him 
i d like you to observe  ed 
call sergeant vincennes 
bright kid 
you may reap the benefit   
   but are you ready to be despised
in the department 
yes  sir  i am 
so be it 
sergeant  we ll get right to it 
nine civilian witnesses have identified
you as hitting ezekiel garcia 
but we have a witness who will name
names and testify that you hit back   
   only after being hit 
you will testify against 3 officers   
   who have earned their pensions
and plead ignorance about the rest 
no thanks 
i m not a snitch 
i ll guarantee you a slap on the wrist 
a brief suspension   
   followed by a temporary transfer
from narcotics to vice 
you transfer out of vice 
you ll be back on the show 
the show 
badge of honor  vincennes 
we need to tone down
your profile for a bit 
i doubt you ve ever taken
a stupid breath  don t start now 
okay  i ll do it 
the grand jury will hear   
   your testimony tomorrow 
and so it goes   
   detective lieutenant 
ace them at the
grand jury tomorrow  son 
wear a smart looking suit
and ace them 
and ed   
   lose the glasses 
so you re the stellar witness 
i should have known 
what s the chief throwing you 
throwing me 
yeah  exley  what s the payoff 
you re the payoff expert 
i m just doing my duty 
come on  you re playing
an angle here  college boy 
you ll get something so you
don t have to hobnob with the cops   
   who ll hate you for snitching 
if they re making you detective 
watch out 
some bureau guys will burn in this and
you ll be working with their friends 
what about you 
i m snitching 3 old timers who ll be
fishing in oregon next week 
next to you  i m clean   
   and smart 
edmund j  exley to chambers 
and remember   
   bud white will fuck you for this
if it takes the rest of his life 
captain  what do you want 
call me dudley 
dudley   
   what do you want 
look  lad  i admire
your refusal to testify   
   and your loyalty to your partner 
i admire you as a policeman   
   and your adherence to violence
as a necessary adjunct to the job 
i m impressed with your
punishment of women beaters 
do you hate them  wendell 
what do you want 
they re yours 
take them 
there s no bill on me 
 4 witnesses recanted their testimony 
 why 
they had a change of heart 
stensland 
your partner s through 
scapegoat on the chief s orders 
a year from his pension 
 exley 
 exley got what he wanted 
as a politician he exceeds even myself 
the department needs
smart men like exley   
   and direct men   
   like you 
look  i need you for an assignment
the chief s given me 
a duty few men are fit for   
   but you were born for 
you d be working
out of homicide at city hall 
homicide 
working cases 
your talents lie elsewhere  wendell

lieutenant  we re ready
with that nite owl i d 
is this your daughter 
i don t know 
we know this is difficult 
take your time 
it seems like my susan 
but my susan was a blonde 
not a redhead 
when was the last time you saw her 
just before christmas 
we d fought 
i didn t like her boyfriend 
mrs  lefferts   
   does your daughter have
any distinguishing marks 
you got the wrong idea  mister 
i m fine 
she has a birthmark on her hip 
it s her 
my baby 
i m sorry  mrs  lefferts 
who s in charge of this investigation 
captain smith and myself 
why 
 the nite owl massacre  
hyperbole aside   
   this is a heinous crime
that requires swift resolution 
six victims 
one of them  one of our own 
dick stensland 
he was a nite owl regular 
in the wrong place at the wrong time 
robbery is the likely motive 
we have rubber glove smears
on the register and forensics   
   tend toward a trio of shooters 
we do have one hot lead 
three negro juveniles   
   were seen discharging shotguns
in griffith park 
a park ranger i d  d them
as driving a 1948 1950 mercury coupe   
   maroon in color 
an hour ago a canvassing crew
found a news vendor   
   who saw a maroon merc coupe
parked by the nite owl at 1 a m 
dmv has come up with
a registration list of merc coupes 
48 two man teams will shake
three names apiece 
interrogations will be led by
lt  edmund exley 
enough on that 
gentlemen  just go out and get them 
use all necessary force 
the people of los angeles demand it 
dismissed 
why not just put a bounty on them 
 ready to roll 
 you take them  i got something to do 
what if one of these names   
get somebody else 
i got our assignments  big v 
we go by this list  we got
zero chance of making this collar 
i got a guy who knows what happens south
of jefferson  he ll put us at 50 50 
what are you doing 
it s the same sort of thing
that got you in trouble before 
i ll take those odds 
we got it from here 
you two should
bring along a photographer 
i need an address on a customer
of yours  her name is lynn 
 that s all i got to go on 
 yeah 
you already know who i mean 
so cough it up 
there s a billing address
and a delivery address

i don t know him  mr    
officer white 
you know sue lefferts 
you know i do

how did you find me 
nick s liquor  this is where
lynn bracken s booze bills go 
of course 
sue lefferts died at the nite owl 
i m investigating 
everything all right 
fine  phillip  thank you 
what happened to the other guy  buzz 
buzz meeks no longer works for me 
lefferts looked beat up christmas eve
but didn t act it  why 
i think she d been hit in the face
with a tennis racket  she is   was   
   a big doubles fan 
you re a known associate of a woman
killed in a mass murder 
 want to go downtown to discuss this 
 is this official 
somehow i have the feeling
this is more personal with you 
all right  then   
   are you concerned about criminal
matters peripheral to the murders 
 not at the moment 
 you re not obligated to report them 
why were lefferts  eyes black 
i needed a rita hayworth
to fill out my little studio 
what little studio 
well  there s gardner  russell 
monroe  turner    
lynn bracken is my veronica lake 
i use girls that look like movie stars 
sometimes i employ a plastic surgeon 
when the work was done 
that s when you saw us 
it s why her mom couldn t i d  her 
jesus fucking christ 
no  pierce morehouse patchett 
i sense you re on your best behavior 
but that s all i m saying 
if you persist 
we ll meet with my attorney 
would you like lynn bracken s address 
i got her address 
find susan s killer  mr  white 
i ll give you a handsome reward 
whatever you desire 
i know you re not asleep 
what do you want

right now 
hey  doll face

 would you care for a drink 
 yeah  scotch straight 
i was friendly with sue lefferts 
but we weren t friends 
know what i mean 
you sorry she s dead 
of course i am 
what kind of question is that 
do you know why pierce is humoring you 
use words like that 
you might make me mad 
but  do you know 
yeah  i know 
patchett s running whores   
   cut to look like movie stars 
and  judging by his address 
something bigger on the side 
he doesn t want any attention 
that s right  our motives are selfish
so we re cooperating 
so cooperate  why was
susan lefferts at the nite owl 
i don t know  i never heard of
the nite owl till today 
how d she meet patchett 
pierce meets people 
sue had dreams of hollywood
and this is how they turned out 
thanks to pierce 
we still get to act a little 
tell me about pierce 
he s waiting for you to mention money 
want advice  miss bracken 
it s lynn 
miss bracken   
   don t ever try to fucking bribe me   
   or i ll have you and patchett
in shit up to your ears 
i remember you from christmas eve

you re different  officer white

pierce patchett

so admit what you did 
i didn t mean to hurt her 
 maybe she s okay

they re all in the morgue 
they were dead when you left them 
i just wanted to lose my cherry 
she don t die  so i don t die 
she don t die  so i don t die

a naked guy with a gun 
who ll believe that 
get the fuck away from me 
how ll it look in your report 
it ll look like justice 
that s what the man got 
justice 
you don t know the meaning of the word 
you think it means
getting your picture in the paper 
go after criminals for a change 
stensland got what he deserved
and so will you 
it s best to stay away
when his blood is up 
his blood s always up 
perhaps you should
stay away from him altogether 
raymond collins  ty jones
and louis fontaine 
they are considered armed and dangerous 
repeat 
the nite owl suspects have escaped 
how d they get out the window 
they jumped from the 2nd floor 
girl said they left her at 12 
they could get to the nite owl by 1 
the question was 
where did they get their drugs 
i haven t gotten that far yet
