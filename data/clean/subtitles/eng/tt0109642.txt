all grown up
looking so

to antagonize them like that
sometimes being a bitch
is all a woman has to hold onto

you pay by the day or by the week
i assume thats your way of asking
how long lm staying

i didnt kill her
i didnt push her down

drugstore in jonesport puts them aside
for me
i used to read them to vera
when she was clear enough to listen
youve done so well for yourself
is that what you think
how well lve done
hell even miss vera kissmybackcheeks
donovan couldnt help but be impressed
her look when she saw
that pictureonthecover story
you wouldve thought she passed a brick
maybe you ought to slow down
believe me l know my limit
dont that sound familiar
id leave it alone if l were you
ive seen my share of drunks is all
thats all lm sayin
what did he have to be happy about
i suppose making sure everyone was
as miserable as he was
is that why you killed him
oh tough question l guess
occupational hazard
dont feel too bad ma
i asked jean harris the same thing once
lets face it mother
we barely know each other
we havent spoken in years and thats
as much your doing as it is mine
you didnt kill vera great
youve got nothing to worry about

youre still my selena
youre still my good girl
i cant help but be worried for you
my god your hands
scary
i guess if you want to know
somebodys life
you look at their hands
thats what 22 years of vera donovan
will do to you
mrs donovan l promise
there wont be any boys
youre excused susan
but mrs donovan please
kook on the bright side dear
you may not have gotten the job
but think what fun youll have
telling friends
what a bitch vera donovan is
next
ive been working since l was 13 years old
started by housekeeping in a hotel
by the time l left there and high school
l was cleaning three floors all by myself
i took care of my fathers house
after my mother passed on
im married and l have a daughter
this is a big house but lm a big woman
and l can do a good job
i do not pretend to be an easy woman
to work for
dolores
this house has a number of rules
im sure youve heard them secondhand
but lll tell you in person
so we can avoid a teary scene later on
i like all the windows open every day
for at least two hours
she did have her ways did she ever
i dont know where she got them
but l know she was a prisoner of them
the silver has to be checked and
cleaned every week it may look clean
to you but l like to see my face in it
the tubs had to be scrubbed out every day
with vinegar and baking soda
tablecloths napkins handkerchiefs
everything handwashed
ironed and starched
mildew was grounds for firing
the sheets
now that was one thing you didnt
ever want to get wrong
you couldve cut off
her highflown snobbish nose
and shed still smell a sheet
that had hung outside
from one baked in the dryer
excuse me mr donovan
do you have to do that now
talk to the missus
her husband
jack
he only came up once all summer
most of which he spent
ignoring her anyway
she couldve easily had the clothesline
near the house
but not vera donovan no maam
she had to have the south wind blowin
through her linens
and that meant trampin up and down
that hill twice a day when it was fair
isnt this glorious jack
six pins dolores
you know thats the way l like it
six pins not five
jack
its 430
dont you want a cocktail
three square meals of bitchery
all summer long
but l kept my head down
and my mouth shut
every week that 40 went in the bank
there wasnt a damn thing
she could say about it
thanks a lot
as much as she crabbed
that whole summer
l must have done something right
come kabor day
im sure your winter schedule
is rather hectic
but l need someone to touch up
the house once a week
dusting
keeping the mice company
i could do that for you
12 a week was
what l had in mind
thatd be fine
ill see you next memorial day
that winter jack donovan passed on
he died in a car crash in maryland
i wasnt sure what to expect from vera
gorry if she didnt show up in high spirits
i believe l told you more than once
l want the welcome mats
with the letters facing out and not in
yes maam
shed sold her place in baltimore
she was moving up permanent
get that out of here and put that there
and take away this disgusting sofa
it took two days to load in
her majestys palace
she offered me full time and l took it
i took it
i knew what kind of hell it would be
hell aint something
you get thrown into overnight
the real hell comes on you as slow
and steady as a line
of wet winter sheets
snot leaking offyour nose
your hands so cold and raw
you start wishing theyd go numb
its only december
you know by february
the skins gonna be cracked so bad itll
break open and bleed ifyou clench a fist
but you go to the next
and the next and before you know it
those sheets stretch out 20 years
nobody made you stay there
i needed the money
not in the beginning not 40 a week
thats when l needed it the most
not for me for you
thats perfect
so its my fault
you think your father cared
if you ever got off this island
here we go
i put that money
every week l put it away
in your account
for school
to get you out of this place
once and for all
well it worked like a charm
hello ladies
a little morning walk
nope
just packing up the speed boat
so as l can make my big escape
something we can help you with
we need a hair sample
how was that
we need a piece of your hair
were running some tests
are you now
just a strand
i think well take a pass on that
look
right now its voluntary
id appreciate it is all
bring your scissors did you
i said well pass
ill have a warrant here this afternoon
you want it
you cut it
actually l need to pull it
we need the root
go on
take what you want
i aint doing any beauty pageants
this week
anything else
mother enough
we spoke to sheila jolander last night
she said shed heard you more than once
threaten to kill vera donovan
is that true
if shed come every day not once a week
shed have heard more
get in the house
vera at the end
the way she got its a wonder
l didnt say it every hour
you go ahead mr mackey
you scribble that down in your pad there
you make a note on that
as long as you write down
that saying a thing and doing it
are two separate things
but your wife probably
already told you that
dolores thats enough
my wife
ms claiborne
died 12 years ago of bone cancer
natural causes
okay l guess well press on here
frank
i want to get into veras
i got things up there l need
clothes and my personals
we can go over tomorrow were shipping
out veras body this afternoon
fine by me
what the hell did l just see
thats the last guy in the world
you want to make an enemy out of
i aint making one lm keeping one
what is that supposed to mean
youre gonna tell me
you dont remember him
thats all well and good miss st george
but you told me that at the time
of your fathers death
you were working as a maid in a hotel
at jonesport
yes
well
mrs devereaux
at the hotel
remember
mrs devereaux said
she was surprised to see you
she said your mom was pretty strict about
not letting you spend the night there
isnt that true
i guess
so why did she let you stay
on that particular weekend
problems at home perhaps
your mom and dad
is that a happy situation
miss st george
the eclipse
because of the eclipse the hotel was full
so the money
they said that wed make twice as much
so this was all about money
my mom let me stay
they said that wed make twice as much
so your father
that was just a coincidence was it
how long are you gonna let this go on
the sooner she starts telling the truth
the sooner well be done
if hes out to torture someone
ld be happy to get back in the hot seat
anybody who accuses me of killing
my husband go ahead and call me dolores
detective mackey you understand
hes just doing his job
trying to turn an accident into a murder
making a girl who just lost her father
cry her eyes out every night
if thats just doing his job then
youd better put him down for overtime
all right lets split them up
slow down john
five minutes alone without her
enough john
i only need five minutes
i said enough
so dont be talkin to me
about makin enemies
no sir no maam
that son of a bitch has been waitin
a long time to pick over my bones
hand me that ax
just look at this window
little piss squirts
i ought to call their parents
and have them come over and pay for it
now l gotta go buy glass and
putty and god knows what else
could have burned down
the whole goddamn house
i thought the malpractice story
was the most important
if youd left the number
ld have called yesterday
yeah right kook
the radiologist l told you about
he got cold feet
but the intern levitt
hes a talker
i thought you were going up there
to see your mother
its a small domestic drama up here peter
i can be in phoenix tuesday
itll be over monday
family things lve been through it
they take a lot
i am telling you its not a problem
we both want me to do this story
im out of here monday at the latest
you want a wet dream
wait till l tell you what kevitt said
are you there
i gave the piece to maureen
kook lm sorry i couldnt wait
the magazine has to be first on this
it has nothing to do with you
you know that
so l guess youre fucking maureen now
nice try come on selena
you couldnt tell me to my face
look l never promised you
you goddamn pimp
careful
i need this story peter
there are other stories better stories
bullshit this was the one
its over
selena it doesnt have to be
ill do this again
shouldnt you be off somewhere
analyzing my mothers hair
well l was thinking how hard
it must be for you
protecting her like this
shes a hearty soul isnt she
might just live another 50 years
next eclipse is due in 96
if she gets away with it this time
she might actually have
another chance to
kill again before shes through
is that something you want
on your conscience
i had a problem with that myself
you know were probably more alike
than youd care to believe
we live alone
no children
we have our work
my cases are my family
in 30 years lve handled 86 homicides
ive closed 85 of them
to my satisfaction
i underestimated your mother
it wont happen again
you sent that fax to my office
didnt you
for god will bring every work
into judgment
with every secret thing
whether it be good or evil
you son of a bitch
vera donovans on my head

in new york
it could take a couple of days
thats why on monday

lm trying to help you
you think l give a fiddlers fuck
what anybody else says about me

shes mean shes cheap
why not leave
why not just walk
like they do in new york
someone hurts me
l leave
believe me l learned that long
before l got to new york

what is that supposed to mean
youre blaming him
is that what were into now
he was a drunk
barely got out of his own way

maybe he hit you
i dont remember it
you dont seem to remember
much of anything
but then hes not exactly around
to defend himself is he
you honest to god dont remember
do you
look
heres the goddamn list
you do what you want with it
thats why youre so unsettled aint it
unsettled
dont you mean boogery mother
if youre attempting
a meaningful analysis
perhaps wed best define our terms
a cornerstone of critical thinking
is communicating
with an agreed vocabulary
go have another drink
no lve had my fun for the night
you sit down right this minute
and you can just stow that vassar shit
were gonna sit down at this table
you and me
and were gonna have a drink
when were through
when lm through
you can run upstairs and take whichever
of those little pills makes you feel the best
dont say a goddamn word
before you get too deep in that
to make sense
take a look at her report card
i saw it
so what
everybody slips now and then
can l be excused
not till you say how an honor student
who skips the seventh grade
goes from straight as to cs and ds
in two semesters
will you leave her alone already
its not like you were some great genius
at school
no claiborne wasnt even born
in a hospital for chrissake
may l please be excused
no you may not
yes you may go right ahead dear

mom please
selena did you steal this
no lts mine
oh my god
as you can see mrs st george
this accounts been closed out
by your husband
how can that be
thats my life savings how can that be
when l got the passbook right here
you see mrs st george that is
was what we call
a custodial savings account
that means either parent
can countersign and make a withdrawal
this doesnt show any withdrawals
howd he get the money
without the goddamn passbook
mrs st george
if l could ask you
to keep your voice down
according to this your husband stated
passbook was lost
he asked to be issued a new one
its common enough
common be damned
i opened this account
who do you think put the money
in the bank to begin with
please mrs st george
im sorry but l assure you
what we did was not only legal
but standard bank practice
maybe its legal and maybe it aint
i cant believe standard practice
means you dont make
one single goddamn phone call
to the person whose name
is on the account
im very sorry
say youre sorry again lll kick your butt
till you look like a hunchback
lydia
its cause lm a woman aint it
if ld been the one passing off a fairy story
how ld lost the passbook
and asked for a new one
if ld been the one who started drawing out
what took 1 1 years to put in
you would have called joe
well
i suppose its one of two things
either hes buried it in a mason jar
in the backyard or else
he opened up a new account
mr pease
you dont have to tell me
but l hope youll think for a moment
about the grief and heartache you could
have saved me by making just one call
im asking you to please tell me
whether hes opened a new account here
or if lve gotta start digging holes
around my house
as soon as the luncheon silver is clean
l want the guest rooms aired out
ill want to go over the linens
for the daybeds in the study
and the sun room
no joy l dont like those colors together
change them
dolores did you check on the flowers
must you look so trodupon dolores
in 36 hours you will have
the uniquely thrilling experience
of standing at the epicenter
of a total solar eclipse
ive got guests traveling 800 miles
for something all you need to do is look
did you see dolores
as soon as the caterers arrive l want you
to make sure they have everything needed
ive made a list

im sorry mrs donovan i truly am
vera

i was gonna use that 3000 to get us
as far away from here as possible
and how far is that dolores
jonesport bangor
youve never been more than 50 miles
away from this island in your life
how long do you think
it would take him to find you
its a depressingly masculine world
we live in dolores
maybe lm wrong
what if youre right
husbands die every day dolores
why
one is probably dying right now
while youre sittin here weeping
they die
and leave their wives their money
i should know shouldnt l
sometimes theyre driving home
from their mistresss apartment
and their brakes suddenly fail
an accident dolores
can be an unhappy womans best friend
dont you just love the bossa nova
i found them in new york
i just had to have them
hi how are you

the eclipse lasted six and a half minutes
they said it was some kind of record
it was a lot more than a thunderhead
passing across the sun
it was beautiful
i burned the dress
and l dropped the whiskey bottle
out near the well
i started askin folks if theyd seen joe
off on a bender somewhere
besides mackey showing up
and making trouble
it was easier than l thought
thats what happened
plain and true
and l dont care no more who knows it
i guess all l do care about
all l ever cared about
is that youre safe and sound
i lied to you
and l lied to myself
now its time to pay the piper

youre my good girl
i love you selena
youre my good girl
you want your change or what
no you keep it
i was gonna kill her your honor
she tried to do it herself
but she was still alive
she begged me to finish what she started
i didnt know if l could do it or not
by the time l got back from the kitchen
she was dead
just your good luck l guess
they tell me youve waived your right
to council
yes sir
i tell you lve married people
whove brought lawyers with them
lets just get this over with
before l sign detective mackeys report
there are a few things
ld like him to clarify for me
ms claiborne
l have several witnesses
who say they were present when
you threatened the life of vera donovan
now thats true is it not
why dont you just go ahead and ask me
what you really want to know
in due time ms claiborne in due time
is it true you made those threats
of course its true
she told you herself on saturday
im sorry this is a closed hearing
the woman sitting over there the one
without a lawyer thats my mother
this isnt a trial
i have every right to be here with her
selena st george
dont stop lets just wrap this up
and get back to the mainland
this report is incomplete
maybe before you sign off on this
were in the middle of a questioning here
miss st george
my mother did not kill vera donovan
thats funny ive got 30 pages here
that say she did
this thing is totally circumstantial
ive covered enough courtrooms
to know hes got no hard evidence
circumstantial samuel marchant page 6
tell him whats not in the report
youve had the whole weekend
to get yourself a lawyer
what is it thats not in the report
these two women loved each other
oh really
now thats something wed like to hear
thats something
we definitely missed
in our investigation
isnt it frank
why dont you tell us
about this great mutual affection
your personal observations
howd they get along when youd visit
christmas birthdays holidays
whenever you could tear yourself away
from your judicial reportage
why dont you tell us miss st george
when was your last visit
miss
fifteen years ago
you must have some memory
these women were together for 22 years
my mother spent the last 10 caring
for vera
24 hours a day 365 days a year
for 80 a week
you should quit while youre ahead
he says they hated each other
i want to know if you hated each other
so much why you stayed together
there were other jobs
better jobs
why go through 20 years of hell
why mother
please miss this is embarrassing
youre supposed to be a professional
arent you
we know l never visited
who did
in the past few years
who else has been in that house
doc collin came once a month
lets not forget sammy marchant
nobody else gave a damn
whether they lived or died
all they had was each other
thats why you stayed together
i mean is that what you do
when you hate someone
you trade off your life for
what 20 cents an hour
just to keep them going
please all this is very touching
but 1600000
is a little more than 20 cents an hour
my mother never knew about the will
come on miss st george
the will is eight years old
you were there frank
when mackey told her about the will
you think she knew
he is not on trial
neither is my mother
constable
she seemed pretty surprised l guess
to me
thats how l saw it
you want us to believe
that they were best friends
and alone for eight years
and they never even talked about it
i think people can keep secrets
a lot longer than eight years
a 1600000 secret
come on
did you know about the will
ms claiborne
no sir
vera made it pretty clear she was plannin
on takin it all with her when she went
i figured when she died thered be
some laundry and a faretheewell
isnt that convenient
you dont believe her
then l tell you what detective
we may be in the presence
of a truly gifted criminal mind
for eight years shes a heartbeat away
from being the richest woman
on the island
so what does she do
does she wait one year
and let vera drown in the tub
three years starving her
youre digging in deeper
smother her in her sleep
drug her
my mothers plan is far more brilliant
than that
she waits through eight years of bed pans
sponge baths diapers and bed sores
she waits eight years until veras
already got one foot in the grave
then what does she do
we know
thats your theory isnt it
she waited eight years
to throw her down the stairs
yes to make it look like an accident
an accident she ransacked the kitchen
for a rolling pin
calm down
how will beating vera to death
look like an accident
she panicked just as youre doing now
sammy marchant brought the mail
every day at noon
why not wait
she panicked
she knew she had to finish
how do you know
fourteen years experience
youve never been wrong
not when it counted
thats right youre 85 for 86 arent you
yes l am
one case away from a perfect record
this report is the truth
truth bullshit why dont you tell him
why were really here
go on
tell him
because shes done it before
wait a minute
is there some prior felony here john
no theres not
they wouldnt indict her
eighteen years ago
my father drank some scotch
and fell down a well
detective mackey didnt think
it was an accident which is
why were here today
what do you think selena
i think that l owe you an apology
i called you a son of a bitch
you said you thought we were a lot alike
and you were right
weve both spent the past 18 years
prosecuting this woman
we came out here
l know l did
believing she was guilty
we forgot this case is
about vera donovan
not my father
and what if it wasnt an accident
look
its been 18 years
i dont know what this has done to you
but let me tell you its consumed me
i have lived with this every day of my life
every day
but it was wrong
and l wont do it anymore
and if l can say that my god
cant you
she didnt kill vera donovan
youve been out here looking
for a smoking gun
there isnt one
all youve got is a 30page description
of a suicide
im asking you
as an honorable man
with all of your experience
all that youve seen
would we be here now
if this was anyone other
than dolores claiborne
this reports the truth
id like you to know that if you go
to trial with this youll fail again
youd better ask yourself
how you want to finish your career
ive got a long list of new york lawyers
whod just love to take you
and this case apart in front of a jury
mother
come on lets go
they cant hurt you anymore
john
this is your ball game
im gonna leave this up to you
come on
its time
even when its warm here its cold
it wont be like that in arizona
there is no arizona
i dont have to go
it was a lie
my editor
the story the book
its all over
do l still have to worry about you
i dont know how to feel
about what you did
maybe l never will
but l know you did it for me
i dont want to lose you again
