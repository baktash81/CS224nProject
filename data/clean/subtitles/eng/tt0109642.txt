to be honest 
l m surprised to see you here 
your mom s been pretty firm
about us not trying to contact you 
 i didn t know dolores made any calls 
 she didn t call 
i saw the bangor paper 
it was faxed to my office 
and where s that 
i came up from new york 
look  is she here or not 
 yeah  she s right upstairs 
 thank you 
but    
john

detective mackey came last night 
and we re just starting 
on what 
we ve scheduled an inquest
for monday morning 
we ll sort things out over the weekend 
if she s not under arrest
why is she in custody 
right  okay  vera donovan is dead 
there s an autopsy in machais
this morning 
and  you know   
   she died from a fall 
your mother was the only person
with mrs  donovan at the time 
that was her job  wasn t it 
i m afraid  miss st  george   
   there s a little more to this
than what you may have read in the paper 
what are you doing 
straightening up this friggin  mess 
is what l m doing 
gorry  but this place is a dump 
jesus  you re a suspect  you re not a maid 
just leave that be 
there s someone to see you here 
i told you  l don t want no lawyer 
it s your daughter 
my god 
look at you 
you cut your hair 
i didn t    
you call her 
is that what you did 
 jeezly crow  you got some nerve 
 she s here on her own 
look at you 
i m just    
my god 
is it really you 
look 
 hey  ms  claiborne

 one last thing  mrs  st  george 
name is claiborne 
i changed it when joe died 
and you know it 
i m very sorry  ms  claiborne 
 morning  pam 
i m sorry  but l think it s for the best
if you got some legal representation 
you re sorry  are you 
last time you were sorry was
when you had to use the pay toilet   
   and the string on your pet dime broke 
i m just muzzy here 
trying to think of what to say 
all grown up   
   looking so    
you turned out a beautiful woman  selena 
i just can t believe you re here 
that makes two of us 
there must be a reason
why you go out of your way   
   to antagonize them like that 
sometimes being a bitch
is all a woman has to hold onto 
nice car 
it s a rental 
you pay by the day or by the week 
i assume that s your way of asking
how long l m staying 
good gorry  you re more nervous than me 
i have to be in phoenix on monday 
it s a big story  i m trying to get out of it 
but it may not be possible  all right 
i didn t kill her 
i didn t push her down
that friggin  staircase 
that s what you want to know 
well  l m telling you 
i did not murder that bitch any more
than l m wearing a diamond tiara 
he s got an eyewitness   
   who puts you standing over a dead body
with a rolling pin 
when did you start smoking 
are you not listening to me 
they re talking murder here 
you re lucky l didn t have to post bail 
spooky  ain t it

i hear an awful lot of thunder upstairs 
but l can t find selena anywhere 
where is she 
is she lost 
what was that l heard 
what did l hear 
i don t know  i think l heard something 
there you are 
let me help you  that s my job 
 you must be starving 
 all these calls 
ended up longer than l thought 
water s warm 
you ll want a nice  hot bath  i got this 
i spent an hour finding this radiologist   
   just so that he could tell me
he won t go on record 
is that your new story 
you say there s hot water 
why don t you go on up
and get yourself fresh 
go on 
it won t bite you 
must be a lot of pressure 
all them famous people   
   talking to them 
i framed the picture 
you and richard nixon 
he was selling a book 
i got a scrapbook 
saved all your articles 
drugstore in jonesport puts them aside
for me 
i used to read them to vera   
   when she was clear enough to listen 
you ve done so well for yourself 
is that what you think 
how well l ve done 
hell  even miss vera kiss my back cheeks
donovan couldn t help but be impressed 
her look when she saw
that picture on the cover story    
you would ve thought she passed a brick 
maybe you ought to slow down 
believe me  l know my limit 
don t that sound familiar 
i d leave it alone if l were you 
i ve seen my share of drunks  is all 
that s all l m sayin  
what did he have to be happy about 
i suppose making sure everyone was
as miserable as he was 
is that why you killed him 
oh  tough question  l guess 
occupational hazard 
don t feel too bad  ma 
i asked jean harris the same thing once 
let s face it  mother 
we barely know each other 
we haven t spoken in years  and that s
as much your doing as it is mine 
you didn t kill vera  great 
you ve got nothing to worry about 
if you did  then you deserve
whatever comes 
just   
   let s not pretend we re in some goddamn
norman rockwell family reunion here

unless they mean it

let s not get off track here 
you re my daughter 
i know that probably feels like something
better left alone  but it s true 
you re still my selena 
you re still my good girl 
i can t help but be worried for you 
my god  your hands 
scary 
i guess if you want to know
somebody s life   
   you look at their hands 
that s what 22 years of vera donovan
will do to you 
mrs  donovan  l promise
there won t be any boys 
you re excused  susan 
but mrs  donovan  please 
kook on the bright side  dear 
you may not have gotten the job   
   but think what fun you ll have
telling friends   
   what a bitch vera donovan is 
next 
i ve been working since l was 13 years old 
started by housekeeping in a hotel 
by the time l left there and high school   
   l was cleaning three floors all by myself 
i took care of my father s house
after my mother passed on 
i m married and l have a daughter 
this is a big house  but l m a big woman 
and l can do a good job 
i do not pretend to be an easy woman
to work for 
 dolores  
this house has a number of rules 
i m sure you ve heard them second hand 
but l ll tell you in person   
   so we can avoid a teary scene later on 
i like all the windows open every day
for at least two hours    
she did have her ways  did she ever 
i don t know where she got them 
but l know she was a prisoner of them 
the silver has to be checked and   
   cleaned every week  it may look clean
to you  but l like to see my face in it 
the tubs had to be scrubbed out every day
with vinegar and baking soda 
tablecloths  napkins  handkerchiefs   
   everything hand washed 
ironed and starched 
mildew was grounds for firing 
the sheets 
now  that was one thing you didn t   
   ever want to get wrong 
you could ve cut off
her high flown snobbish nose   
   and she d still smell a sheet
that had hung outside   
   from one baked in the dryer 
excuse me  mr  donovan 
do you have to do that now 
talk to the missus 
her husband   
   jack 
he only came up once all summer 
most of which he spent
ignoring her anyway 
she could ve easily had the clothesline
near the house 
but not vera donovan  no  ma am 
she had to have the south wind blowin 
through her linens 
and that meant trampin  up and down
that hill twice a day when it was fair 
isn t this glorious  jack 
six pins  dolores 
you know that s the way l like it 
six pins  not five 
jack 
it s 4 30 
don t you want a cocktail 
three square meals of bitchery
all summer long   
   but l kept my head down
and my mouth shut 
every week that  40 went in the bank 
there wasn t a damn thing
she could say about it 
thanks a lot 
as much as she crabbed
that whole summer   
   l must have done something right 
come kabor day    
i m sure your winter schedule
is rather hectic   
   but l need someone to touch up
the house once a week 
dusting 
keeping the mice company 
i could do that for you 
 12 a week was   
   what l had in mind 
that d be fine 
i ll see you next memorial day 
that winter  jack donovan passed on 
he died in a car crash in maryland 
i wasn t sure what to expect from vera 
gorry if she didn t show up in high spirits 
i believe l told you more than once   
   l want the welcome mats
with the letters facing out and not in 
yes  ma am 
she d sold her place in baltimore 
she was moving up permanent 
get that out of here and put that there 
and take away this disgusting sofa 
it took two days to load in
her majesty s palace 
she offered me full time and l took it 
i took it 
i knew what kind of hell it would be 
hell ain t something
you get thrown into overnight 
the real hell comes on you as slow   
   and steady as a line
of wet winter sheets 
snot leaking offyour nose 
your hands so cold and raw   
   you start wishing they d go numb 
it s only december 
you know by february   
   the skin s gonna be cracked so bad  it ll
break open and bleed ifyou clench a fist 
but you go to the next   
   and the next and before you know it 
those sheets stretch out 20 years 
nobody made you stay there 
 i needed the money 
 not in the beginning  not  40 a week 
that s when l needed it the most 
not for me  for you 
that s perfect 
so it s my fault 
you think your father cared
if you ever got off this island 
here we go 
i put that money   
   every week  l put it away
in your account   
   for school 
to get you out of this place 
once and for all 
well  it worked like a charm 
hello  ladies 
a little morning walk 
nope 
just packing up the speed boat
so as l can make my big escape 
something we can help you with 
we need a hair sample 
how was that 
we need a piece of your hair 
we re running some tests 
 are you now 
 just a strand 
i think we ll take a pass on that 
look   
   right now it s voluntary 
i d appreciate it  is all 
bring your scissors  did you 
i said we ll pass 
i ll have a warrant here this afternoon 
you want it   
   you cut it 
actually  l need to pull it 
we need the root 
go on 
take what you want 
i ain t doing any beauty pageants
this week 
 anything else 
 mother  enough 
we spoke to sheila jolander last night 
she said she d heard you more than once
threaten to kill vera donovan 
is that true 
if she d come every day not once a week 
she d have heard more 
 get in the house 
 vera  at the end   
   the way she got  it s a wonder
l didn t say it every hour 
you go ahead  mr  mackey 
you scribble that down in your pad there 
you make a note on that 
as long as you write down
that saying a thing and doing it   
   are two separate things 
but  your wife probably
already told you that 
dolores  that s enough 
my wife   
   ms  claiborne   
   died 12 years ago of bone cancer 
natural causes 
okay  l guess we ll press on here 
frank 
i want to get into vera s 
i got things up there l need 
clothes and my personals 
we can go over tomorrow  we re shipping
out vera s body this afternoon 
fine by me 
what the hell did l just see 
that s the last guy in the world
you want to make an enemy out of 
i ain t making one  l m keeping one 
what is that supposed to mean 
you re gonna tell me
you don t remember him 
that s all well and good  miss st  george   
   but you told me that at the time
of your father s death   
   you were working as a maid in a hotel
at jonesport 
yes 
well   
   mrs  devereaux   
   at the hotel    
remember 
mrs  devereaux said   
   she was surprised to see you 
she said your mom was pretty strict about
not letting you spend the night there 
isn t that true 
i guess 
so why did she let you stay
on that particular weekend 
problems at home  perhaps 
your mom and dad   
   is that a happy situation 
miss st  george 
the eclipse 
because of the eclipse  the hotel was full 
so the money    
they said that we d make twice as much 
so this was all about money 
my mom let me stay 
they said that we d make twice as much 
so your father   
   that was just a coincidence  was it 
how long are you gonna let this go on 
the sooner she starts telling the truth 
the sooner we ll be done 
if he s out to torture someone 
l d be happy to get back in the hot seat 
anybody who accuses me of killing
my husband  go ahead and call me dolores 
detective mackey  you understand 
he s just doing his job 
trying to turn an accident into a murder 
making a girl who just lost her father
cry her eyes out every night 
if that s just doing his job then
you d better put him down for overtime 
all right  let s split them up 
slow down  john 
five minutes  alone  without her 
enough  john 
i only need five minutes 
i said   enough  
so don t be talkin  to me
about makin  enemies 
no  sir  no  ma am 
that son of a bitch has been waitin 
a long time to pick over my bones 
hand me that ax 
just look at this window 
little piss squirts 
i ought to call their parents
and have them come over and pay for it 
now l gotta go buy glass and   
   putty and god knows what else 
could have burned down
the whole goddamn house 
i thought the malpractice story
was the most important 
if you d left the number
l d have called yesterday 
yeah  right  kook 
the radiologist l told you about   
   he got cold feet 
but  the intern  levitt   
   he s a talker 
i thought you were going up there
to see your mother 
it s a small domestic drama up here  peter 
i can be in phoenix tuesday 
it ll be over monday 
family things  l ve been through it 
they take a lot 
i am telling you  it s not a problem 
we both want me to do this story 
i m out of here monday at the latest 
you want a wet dream 
wait till l tell you what kevitt said 
are you there 
i gave the piece to maureen 
kook  l m sorry  i couldn t wait 
the magazine has to be first on this 
it has nothing to do with you 
you know that 
so  l guess you re fucking maureen now 
nice try  come on  selena 
you couldn t tell me to my face 
look  l never promised you  
you goddamn pimp 
 careful 
 i need this story  peter 
there are other stories  better stories 
bullshit  this was the one 
it s over 
selena  it doesn t have to be  
i ll do this again 
shouldn t you be off somewhere
analyzing my mother s hair 
well  l was thinking how hard
it must be for you 
protecting her like this 
she s a hearty soul  isn t she 
might just live another 50 years 
next eclipse is due in  96 
if she gets away with it this time   
   she might actually have
another chance to   
   kill again  before she s through 
is that something you want
on your conscience 
i had a problem with that myself 
you know  we re probably more alike
than you d care to believe 
we live alone   
   no children 
we have our work 
my cases are my family 
in 30 years  l ve handled 86 homicides 
i ve closed 85 of them   
   to my satisfaction 
i underestimated your mother 
it won t happen again 
you sent that fax to my office   
   didn t you 
 for god will bring every work
into judgment   
    with every secret thing   
    whether it be good or evil  
you son of a bitch 
vera donovan s on my head

dolores  got a certified letter here 
you don t believe me  do you 
you think l killed her 
what l think doesn t mean shit 
it s the rest of the world
you better start worrying about 
i made a list of attorneys 
these are all the big muscle firms
in new york 
it could take a couple of days 
that s why on monday   
   you re not gonna say a word 
take it 
in case you missed it 
l m trying to help you 
you think l give a fiddler s fuck
what anybody else says about me 
oh  jesus 
it s you 
what you think is the only thing left
that s important 
i can t send you to prison 
you think that s the end of the world 
gorry  that d be a relief 
sit and sleep   
   three meals served every day 
maybe you re just happier being miserable 
is that it 
is that it  mother 
if it makes it easier for you 
vera s a bitch  she s abusive 
she s mean  she s cheap 
why not leave 
why not just walk 
like they do in new york 
someone hurts me   
   l leave 
believe me  l learned that long
before l got to new york 
i m not the one that hurt you 
what is that supposed to mean 
you re blaming him 
is that what we re into now 
he was a drunk 
barely got out of his own way 
fine   
   maybe he hit you 
i don t remember it 
you don t seem to remember
much of anything 
but then  he s not exactly around
to defend himself  is he 
you honest to god don t remember 
do you 
look 
here s the goddamn list 
you do what you want with it 
that s why you re so unsettled  ain t it 
unsettled 
don t you mean  boogery   mother 
if you re attempting
a meaningful analysis   
   perhaps we d best define our terms 
a cornerstone of critical thinking   
   is communicating
with an agreed vocabulary 
go have another drink 
no  l ve had my fun for the night 
you sit down right this minute
and you can just stow that vassar shit 
we re gonna sit down at this table 
you and me   
   and we re gonna have a drink 
when we re through    
when l m through   
   you can run upstairs and take whichever
of those little pills makes you feel the best 
don t say a goddamn word 
before you get too deep in that
to make sense   
   take a look at her report card 
i saw it 
so what 
everybody slips now and then 
can l be excused 
not till you say how an honor student   
   who skips the seventh grade   
   goes from straight a s to c s and d s
in two semesters 
will you leave her alone already 
it s not like you were some great genius
at school 
no claiborne wasn t even born
in a hospital  for chrissake 
may l please be excused 
no  you may not 
yes  you may  go right ahead  dear 
thanks a lot 
you better learn to stow it 
you ll drive her right out the door 
mom  what are you doing here 
thought you and l might ride back
on the ferry together  you mind company 
beautiful  ain t it 
you used to be beautiful too 
why ain t you anymore 
when was the last time
you washed your hair 
it s drugs  ain t it 
you ve changed 
you re 13 years old  you re smoking pot 
where do you get it 
how long s it been going on 
i don t do drugs  mother 
whatever trouble you re in
won t change my love for you 
i can t begin to help you out of it
till you tell me the truth 
are you pregnant 
get real 
you want to end up like me 
dumb and stuck 
think l push you so hard
in school to stay in a uniform   
   and clean up after people forever 
ls that what you want 
i m not pregnant 
then    
what is it 
what the hell s going on with you 
 leave me alone 
 i won t leave you alone 
we ll ride the ferry all day till you say   
   what s wrong 
leave me be 
 why won t you talk to me 
 don t touch me 
what 
stop it 
i got you 
get off of me 
what is the matter with you 
talk to me 
where did you get this 
what re you doin  
this is your grandma st  george s cameo 
 it s mine 
 what did you do 
did you go in your father s closet 
mom  please    
 selena  did you steal this 
 no  lt s mine 
oh  my god 
as you can see  mrs  st  george   
   this account s been closed out
by your husband 
how can that be 
that s my life savings  how can that be
when l got the passbook right here 
you see  mrs  st  george  that is   
   was what we call
a custodial savings account 
that means either parent
can countersign and make a withdrawal 
this doesn t show any withdrawals 
how d he get the money
without the goddamn passbook 
mrs  st  george   
   if l could ask you
to keep your voice down 
according to this  your husband stated 
 passbook was lost  
he asked to be issued a new one 
it s common enough 
common be damned 
i opened this account 
who do you think put the money
in the bank to begin with 
please  mrs  st  george 
i m sorry  but l assure you
what we did was not only legal   
   but standard bank practice 
maybe it s legal and maybe it ain t 
i can t believe standard practice
means you don t make   
   one single goddamn phone call   
   to the person whose name
is on the account 
i m very sorry  
say you re sorry again  l ll kick your butt
till you look like a hunchback 
lydia 
it s  cause l m a woman  ain t it 
if l d been the one passing off a fairy story
how l d lost the passbook   
   and asked for a new one    
if l d been the one who started drawing out
what took 1 1 years to put in   
   you would have called joe 
well    
i suppose it s one of two things 
either he s buried it in a mason jar
in the backyard  or else   
   he opened up a new account 
mr  pease    
you don t have to tell me 
but l hope you ll think for a moment   
   about the grief and heartache you could
have saved me by making just one call 
i m asking you to please tell me
whether he s opened a new account here   
   or if l ve gotta start digging holes
around my house 
as soon as the luncheon silver is clean 
l want the guest rooms aired out 
i ll want to go over the linens
for the daybeds in the study   
   and the sun room 
no  joy  l don t like those colors together 
change them 
dolores  did you check on the flowers 
must you look so trod upon  dolores 
in 36 hours you will have
the uniquely thrilling experience   
   of standing at the epicenter
of a total solar eclipse 
i ve got guests traveling 800 miles
for something all you need to do is look    
did you see dolores 
as soon as the caterers arrive  l want you
to make sure they have everything needed 
i ve made a list 
i want no last minute frantic runs
to jonesport 
do you hear me 
would you put on some tea

 i m sorry  mrs  donovan  i truly am 
 vera  
i insist all women who have hysterics
in my drawing room   
   call me by my christian name 
so  enlighten me  dolores 
what turns a stone hard woman like you
into the blubbering mess l see before me 
joe stole my money 
i went to close out my account    
it was money l d been saving for selena 
 3 000  i went to get it out
and it was gone 
well  don t look to me  dolores 
all my money s tied up in cash 
planning on playing the stock market

i was going to take selena away with me
tonight before he gets back 
well

and why  exactly  are we running away

give it to me  it s mine 
oh  my god

   you damn well better do what he says 
you ll miss your ferry 
you want to hang yourself

and start shooting your mouth off 
i m sorry  mother

a woman has to hold onto  
shit 
i hope l m doing this right 
 cause l never worked one before 
don t these japanese make
the cunningest little gadgets 
you re sleeping now  selena

i m gonna go down tomorrow

i should ve    
the way she s been acting around him

as far away from here as possible 
and how far is that  dolores 
jonesport  bangor 
you ve never been more than 50 miles
away from this island in your life 
how long do you think
it would take him to find you 
it s a depressingly masculine world
we live in  dolores 
maybe l m wrong 
what if you re right 
husbands die every day  dolores 
why   
   one is probably dying right now 
while you re sittin  here weeping 
they die   
   and leave their wives their money 
i should know  shouldn t l 
sometimes they re driving home
from their mistress s apartment   
   and their brakes suddenly fail 
an accident  dolores

no  daddy  please 
come on  now  you know how to do it 
i showed you 
remember how l showed you 
nobody s gonna see us 
come on  baby 
you remember 
you remember how l showed you 
please 
come on 
come on  that s it 
oh  that s it 
you re my good girl 
i love you  selena 
you re my good girl 
you want your change or what 
no  you keep it 
i was gonna kill her  your honor 
she tried to do it herself   
   but she was still alive 
she begged me to finish what she started 
i didn t know if l could do it or not 
by the time l got back from the kitchen
she was dead 
just your good luck  l guess 
they tell me you ve waived your right
to council 
yes  sir 
i tell you  l ve married people
who ve brought lawyers with them 
let s just get this over with 
before l sign detective mackey s report   
   there are a few things
l d like him to clarify for me 
ms  claiborne   
   l have several witnesses   
   who say they were present when
you threatened the life of vera donovan 
now that s true  is it not 
why don t you just go ahead and ask me
what you really want to know 
in due time  ms  claiborne  in due time 
 is it true you made those threats 
 of course  it s true 
she told you herself on saturday 
i m sorry  this is a closed hearing 
the woman sitting over there  the one
without a lawyer  that s my mother 
this isn t a trial 
i have every right to be here with her 
selena st  george 
don t stop  let s just wrap this up
and get back to the mainland 
this report is incomplete 
maybe before you sign off on this  
we re in the middle of a questioning here 
miss st  george 
my mother did not kill vera donovan 
that s funny  i ve got 30 pages here
that say she did 
this thing is totally circumstantial 
i ve covered enough courtrooms
to know he s got no hard evidence 
circumstantial  samuel marchant  page 6 
tell him what s not in the report 
you ve had the whole weekend
to get yourself a lawyer 
what is it that s not in the report 
these two women loved each other 
oh  really 
now that s something we d like to hear 
that s something   
   we definitely missed
in our investigation   
   isn t it  frank 
why don t you tell us
about this great mutual affection 
your personal observations 
how d they get along when you d visit 
christmas  birthdays  holidays   
   whenever you could tear yourself away
from your judicial reportage 
why don t you tell us  miss st  george 
when was your last visit 
miss 
fifteen years ago 
you must have some memory 
these women were together for 22 years 
my mother spent the last 10 caring
for vera   
   24 hours a day  365 days a year   
   for  80 a week 
you should quit while you re ahead 
he says they hated each other 
i want to know if you hated each other
so much why you stayed together 
there were other jobs   
   better jobs 
why go through 20 years of hell 
 why  mother 
 please  miss  this is embarrassing 
you re supposed to be a professional 
aren t you 
we know l never visited 
who did 
in the past few years 
who else has been in that house 
doc collin came once a month 
let s not forget sammy marchant 
nobody else gave a damn
whether they lived or died 
all they had was each other 
that s why you stayed together 
i mean  is that what you do
when you hate someone 
you trade off your life for   
   what  20 cents an hour
just to keep them going 
please  all this is very touching 
but  1 600 000   
   is a little more than 20 cents an hour 
my mother never knew about the will 
come on  miss st  george 
the will is eight years old 
you were there  frank 
when mackey told her about the will 
you think she knew 
he is not on trial 
neither is my mother 
constable 
she seemed pretty surprised  l guess   
   to me 
that s how l saw it 
you want us to believe
that they were best friends   
   and alone for eight years
and they never even talked about it 
i think people can keep secrets
a lot longer than eight years 
a  1 600 000 secret 
come on 
did you know about the will 
ms  claiborne 
no  sir 
vera made it pretty clear she was plannin 
on takin  it all with her when she went 
i figured when she died there d be
some laundry and a fare thee well 
isn t that convenient 
you don t believe her 
then l tell you what  detective 
we may be in the presence
of a truly gifted criminal mind 
for eight years she s a heartbeat away   
   from being the richest woman
on the island 
so what does she do 
does she wait one year
and let vera drown in the tub 
three years starving her 
you re digging in deeper 
smother her in her sleep 
drug her 
my mother s plan is far more brilliant
than that 
she waits through eight years of bed pans 
sponge baths  diapers and bed sores 
she waits eight years until vera s
already got one foot in the grave 
then what does she do 
 we know 
 that s your theory  isn t it 
she waited eight years
to throw her down the stairs 
yes  to make it look like an accident 
an accident  she ransacked the kitchen
for a rolling pin 
calm down 
how will beating vera to death
look like an accident 
she panicked  just as you re doing now 
sammy marchant brought the mail
every day at noon 
 why not wait 
 she panicked 
 she knew she had to finish  
 how do you know 
fourteen years  experience 
 you ve never been wrong 
 not when it counted 
 that s right  you re 85 for 86  aren t you 
 yes  l am 
 one case away from a perfect record 
 this report is the truth 
truth  bullshit  why don t you tell him
why we re really here 
go on 
tell him 
because she s done it before 
wait a minute 
is there some prior felony here  john 
no  there s not 
they wouldn t indict her 
eighteen years ago   
   my father drank some scotch   
   and fell down a well 
detective mackey didn t think
it was an accident  which is   
   why we re here today 
what do you think  selena 
i think that l owe you an apology 
i called you a son of a bitch 
you said you thought we were a lot alike 
and you were right 
we ve both spent the past 18 years
prosecuting this woman 
we came out here   
   l know l did   
   believing she was guilty 
we forgot this case is
about vera donovan   
   not my father 
and what if it wasn t an accident 
look   
   it s been 18 years 
i don t know what this has done to you   
   but let me tell you  it s consumed me 
i have lived with this every day of my life 
every day 
but it was wrong   
   and l won t do it anymore 
and if l can say that  my god   
   can t you 
she didn t kill vera donovan 
you ve been out here looking
for a smoking gun 
there isn t one 
all you ve got is a 30 page description
of a suicide 
i m asking you   
   as an honorable man   
   with all of your experience   
   all that you ve seen   
   would we be here now   
   if this was anyone other
than dolores claiborne 
this report s the truth 
i d like you to know that if you go
to trial with this  you ll fail again 
you d better ask yourself
how you want to finish your career 
i ve got a long list of new york lawyers   
   who d just love to take you
and this case apart in front of a jury 
mother    
come on  let s go 
they can t hurt you anymore 
john 
this is your ball game 
i m gonna leave this up to you 
come on 
it s time 
even when it s warm here  it s cold 
it won t be like that in arizona 
there is no arizona 
i don t have to go 
it was a lie 
my editor   
   the story  the book   
   it s all over 
do l still have to worry about you 
i don t know how to feel
about what you did 
maybe l never will 
but l know you did it for me 
i don t want to lose you again
