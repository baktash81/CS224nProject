you re not simply being
appointed to that position

your reputation is that you control
your business through violence 
that those that don t purchase your
product are dealt with violently 
it s all right 
i grew up in a tough neighborhood 
we used to say   you can get further
with a kind word and a gun 
 than you can
with just a kind word  
and in that neighborhood
it might ve been true 
and sometimes
your reputation follows you 
there is violence in chicago 
but not by me
and not by anybody i employ 
because it s not good business 
leave us alone down here

what you ve done before today

but now we must be pure 
and i want you to stop 
it s not a question of whether it s
 a harmless drink   it may well be

the law  we must do first by example

good  the department
of the treasury s had
a man undercover here

whiskey has arrived in chicago

of police work 
if you want to keep a secret 
don t tell the boss 
you know he s making
over  3 million a year 
but he s paid no taxes 
nothing s in his name 
if we can establish
any payments to him 
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion 
what 
i said  we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion 
try a murderer
for not paying his taxes  
well  it s better than nothing 
all right  how do we
link him to the money 
i don t know 
go to sleep  oscar 
a convoy of 5 10 trucks
with good canadian whiskey
will be met by a high level member
of the capone organization 
he will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash 
now  the meet is to take place just
over the border on the american side 
we want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash 
  captain 
  we will await their signal
