long before man or beast
roamed these lands
there was a war in the heavens
immortals once thought
incapable of death
discovered they had the power
to kill one another
lost in this war was a weapon
the epirus bow
the victors declared themselves gods
while the vanquished
were renamed titans
and forever imprisoned
within the bowels of mount tartarus
eons passed mankind flourished
and the great war
receded from memory
but the evil that once was
has reemerged
stop you cannot enter here
this is sacred ground
sacred for who
what do you want with us
where is the virgin oracle
defile this house further
and you will risk the wrath of the gods
the gods
gods
gods
go ahead call upon them
pray ask for their help
pray to the same gods
who idly stood by
as my wife and my children
were stricken by disease
i too cried to the heavens for help
but instead of mercy
i was met with silence
and the wretched sight of my family
suffering like animals
until their deaths
your gods will no longer mock me
i will release the titans
its not too late to end this madness
salvation can be yours if you wish it
let me enlighten you priest
i will end the reign of gods
you wield that ax well theseus
maybe someday well see you use
the same determination to find a wife
are you conspiring with my mother now
she worries about you
theres no need to worry about me
you know being a warrior
is not just being able to strike
your opponent down with a sword
its finding good reason
to draw your sword in the first place
i draw my sword
to protect those that i love
what about the others
the others turn their backs on me
the weak
the defenseless
whos going to protect them
careful too much worrying
will make you an old man
whore
oh
last lights for the labyrinth
last lights for the holy labyrinth
let the ancestors rest in peace
theseus
may the gods be with you
thank you for the offerings
another accident
theseus maybe one day
youll join me in prayer
ask the gods to grant me grandchildren
before im too old
mother your gods are childrens
stories my spear is not
and you know mother it takes more
than lighting candles to make babies
besides our priest
wears a ridiculous hat
theseus
mother stay here
theseus
fellow hellenics
it is with great concern
that i stand before you
the heraklion king hyperion
has seized the sibylline monastery
he is only a days march from here
we must evacuate
this village immediately
we must fight him
at the gates of our village
silence please quiet
villagers we stand no chance
i said fall in lysander
we stand no chance
he is weary from battle
please we ask that every man woman
and child gather your belongings
leave for mount tartarus
seek refuge behind the safety
of the great wall
there you will be protected
anyone who needs more time
the old the infirm
we will escort in a days time
only what you can carry
prepare your departure
leave it its not essential
give me that
leave that
move along now
youre with the wrong party
is this not the caravan
traveling to tartarus
it is but you will not
be traveling among us
go in the morning with your own kind
my kind
peasants and undesirables
travel tomorrow
my kinds blood
is the same color as yours
should we spill some to prove it
theseus
mother
what happens here
this bastard and his whore mother
stop fall back
fall back
put the sword down
i will not
kill him
try he dies first
what is it that you want brother
it seems as though my kind
travel in the morning
i want them to have a proper escort
move again and i will bury this
in your skull
whats your name
theseus
now is not the time
for violence theseus let him go
only if i have your word the rest
of the village will be protected
you have my word i will leave
capable men for the caravan tomorrow
kill this traitor
enough with your spectacle
restrain him get him out of my sight
hes a bastard
take him away and disarm him
mother
save your bloodlust
for heraklion veins theseus
join our ranks
you have been trained well
i had a good teacher
i could use men of your skill at our
side to defeat hyperions legions
why would i serve you
you who would so easily abandon us
lets go mother
lysander youre no longer
pan of this army
relinquish your shield your spear
and remain here to travel
with the peasants tomorrow
but you saw him
its done
ill see you later
where are your things old man
are you not prepared for the march
such odysseys were meant
for the young and expectant
not for a wornout old goat like me
please reconsider
you know staying here is suicide
if the heraklions show up
at least ill be spared a slow death
from what i understand
indecision is not their style
you are mad
no
just tired
its not living as such
thats important theseus
its living rightly
they fight with a ferocity
unlike anything ive seen
it was as if they could
see in the darkness
as though it suited them
you speak as if theyre not human
they are human
the heraklions bleed just as we do
the only difference is
they fight for a belief
which allows them to kill
without restraint
that is why they will win
lysander i thought helios
ordered you disarmed
he did
reveal yourself
reveal yourself
father
athena
zeus
no need for formalities
none of the other gods
are looking are they
what
when you walked up here just now
you actually looked like a father
or maybe a grandfather
we must tread carefully here
heed the law
none of the mortals on earth
should witness us in our immortal form
but father youve come
dangerously close
youve been influencing
the boy theseus for years
yet as one of them never as a god
only as his friend
and why him
he does not fear danger
nor pain defeat or ridicule
he fears only the failure to defend
that which he holds so dear
his loved ones
if there is one human who could
lead them against hyperion
it would be theseus
but it must be his choice
hes a defector
he wants to meet the king
move
you are a defector i understand
yes my king
i am not your king
but i wish you to be
but you are a traitor by definition
are you not
what would i want
with a traitor in my midst
i can tell you of a village
that lies unprotected
where you can gather young women
i have plenty of women
slaves and weaponry
i have plenty of weapons
what i want is the epirus bow
like this monastery i have moved every
precious stone your people worship upon
and i have yet to find it
have you ever met
a sibylline monk traitor
monks of his order are unwavering
in their obedience to the virgin oracle
with the right prodding the oracle
could see where the bow rests
couldnt she monk
tell me where she is
i know of your faith monk
sybellines are forbidden to take a life
under any circumstance
even their own
you have no choice
but to tell me what i want to know
a monk can be made to talk
with or without his tongue
give him to the beast make him tell you
where the oracle is being kept
do you have any children
not yet
a mans seed can be
his most brutal weapon
for generations your people will
stare into the eyes of their sons
and they will see my likeness
i will be remembered
in every glance every smile
every tear that is shed for eternity
but before your baptism
understand that you are not
drawn here to my flame on instinct
but you ran here
because you are a coward
and the world does not need
any more cowards
so i shall do this world a great favor
mark you as one of us
and rid you of your ability
to populate the earth
traitor
although you will not hear them
your forefathers weep
from their graves
for the future of their bloodline
ends with you here tonight
old man
old man
hello
your anger rules you theseus
you must learn to master your emotions
rhythm theseus rhythm
you burn that down
get over here
no
huh
theseus
wait
witness hell
no
no
no
not him
no
give him to the jailer
he can work in the salt mines
his pain has just begun
hyperions legions
show no mercy
they have destroyed every holy shrine
in their quest for the epirus bow
it is only a matter of time
before they find it
ive noticed their king
takes the greatest care
with all women who carry a child
and personally sees
to their slaughter
he ventures to eradicate
a hellenic future
they honor no rules of engagement
effective at least thus far
effective
cowardly
that may be
but the hellenics have yet to adapt
and until they do
isnt it time to intervene zeus
how can you stomach bearing witness
to such atrocity whilst doing nothing
i obey the law no god shall interfere
in the affairs of man
unless the titans are released
if we are to expect mankind
to have faith in us
then we must have faith in them
we must allow them
to use their own free will
and what if they unearth the bow
if any of you come to the aid of man
or otherwise influence
the affairs of mankind as a god
the punishment will be death
who are they
the virgin oracles the heraklions
must have found their temple
you dont know of them
i dont
i wouldnt mind knowing them all
for a night
when cloudless
skies thunder stand fast
you were a thief
i am a thief my lady
were it not for these chains
id steal your heart
tonight we must flee this place
whichever are strong enough to fight
and that man there
he didnt even go for the water
he wont make it till morning
just be ready
stay apart
inside
stay alive
only one of them is the true oracle
a seer she is pure
the others are there
to protect her identity
the virgin oracle is blessed
with visions of the future
were she to be violated
her gift of prophecy would be corrupted
what a waste
guards
keys
you should get some sleep
do you know i am stronger than i look
ill be fine
perhaps
perhaps you have
trouble sleeping because
youre haunted by your visions
a warrior who reads minds
some people do consider
my visions to be a gift
gift how can it be considered a gift
when you can see the future but you
dont have the power to change it
sony
why would you do such a thing
you risked your life
to save a complete stranger
only a faithless man
would ask such a question
my mother was a woman of faith
and her gods were absent
when she needed them the most
as was i
so we both mourn
you for what has passed and
and i for what is to come
what happened to them
i gave an order
for them not to be touched
they tried to flee my king
seven of our best men
were killed in the struggle
seven of your best men killed by women
i wish to know where
the epirus bow rests
which of you can tell me this
which of you are the true oracle
if im forced to son you out
by other means
you will experience discomfort
discomfort unique to your gender
so you tell me which one of you is her
i am the one you seek
no it is i
i am the one you seek
the other one said the same thing
they all claim to be the oracle
the other one
yes my king
the other one what other one
there were four of them
one of them escaped
with a group of slaves
from the watering hole
mondragon
sire
find the one that escaped
bring her to me alive
the dark seas
these waters are thick with oil
and the boat
its a heraklion merchant ship
our best bet is to ambush it
and head south
south is not our journey
it is for me
from what i hear
the women down there can get
to the meat of a malaccan chestnut
with only their tongues
shall you and i test the limits
of that desire my dear
the gods have given me vision yet all
you do is dream of your appetites
id rather follow my appetites
than the hallucinations of a harlot
shes a high priestess
it doesnt matter to me
high priestess or whore
im heading south
was it something i said
well friend what will it be
south with me or will you follow
the lady
neither
im taking that ship north
to hyperions camp at the monastery
your savior sounds a lot
like a madman to me your highness
personally id rather fight
with a madman than against one
are you minding this
that is the mortal
your father so extols is it not
and he is with the oracle
poseidon if zeus were to suspect you
we will come to your defense
the rear
i thought you said
this was a merchant ship
i guess i was wrong
the sea has forever been
an unpredictable domain
when the cloudless skies thunder
stand fast
we gotta jump now
stand fast
you knew that wave would save us
what i see is only a glimmer
of what may come to pass
your actions and desires
shape what lies ahead
what else have you seen
a body wrapped in a shroud on a rock
you holding the epirus bow
and
embracing hyperion impossible
i would never embrace hyperion
he killed my mother
your mother
was she given a proper burial
no
she still lies
where hyperion cut her down
then you must bury your mother
her faith demands it
i do not believe in the gods
but she believed
she believed theseus
you must return to your village
have you found the oracle
we did my lord but our men were lost
before we could recover her
a storm swept them to sea
and the oracle
did she survive
she travels towards kolpos
with the slaves
she could be leading them to the bow
mm
send the beast to kolpos
we will go to tartarus
mondragon
sire
you stay here
and set an ambush in the pit
im sorry i couldnt
protect you mother
but i promise you our family name
will not die with me
hyperions legions
are gathering at tartarus
thats where hellenes will fall
that future is not set
but likely it will be a slaughter
you have no faith
heathens
that is true dareios but not always
when i was just a boy
i prayed to the gods for a horse
the gods never answered me
so i stole one instead
were surrounded by heathens
its all right its all right theseus
what happened to me
your arm you were poisoned
where are the others
theyre putting dareios body to rest
she was right
for all those years i doubted her
doubted their existence
your mothers death
was not in vain theseus
it was fate that brought you back
for the bow
and in your hands theseus
it will bring hellenes victory
you were right theseus
my visions are a curse
i want to see the world
through my own eyes
and feel with my own heart
and touch with my own flesh
hey monk i did a little shopping
last night good weapon huh
good to you see youre still alive
i was worried that cow
had gotten the best of you
it almost did she saved my life
looks like she did more than that
careful
just because you have that bow doesnt
mean im going to treat you differently
good we march to the monastery
we have a war to fight
the faithful believe the titans
are still buried deep within the mountain
the great wall is the hellenics
only hope against your army
defenses
originally it was a dam
but the hellenics have since adapted it
no one could have anticipated the enemy
you have become
how many are there
how many have made it here
your majesty im not sure
how many
im not sure your majesty
eight hundred
and the gate
twenty feet of marble stone
weighing over 12 tons
it was designed to be impenetrable
your majesty
have you ever known of a gate
designed to be anything but
go be of service somewhere else
where is he i thought hyperion
was supposed to be camped here
we should continue tartarus is another
two days along this ridge
what is that sound
stay down monk stavros help me
help me keep him down
no no
my sisters my sisters
theyre in the bull
no
i am the true oracle
its me phaedra
i am the oracle
theseus
theyre still here
wait monk
its a trap
monk
theseus
do not stop until you reach tartarus
the horses will run
until their hearts give out
hyperion will soon have the bow leave
forgive me father forgive me
i only broke the law
to protect the mortal
no god will ever again come to your aid
you are on your own
do you understand mortal
i have faith in you theseus
prove me right
lead your people
halt
the horse i prayed for when i was a boy
what is wrong with him
theyre dying
where are the men
they have yet to return sire
what does the sight
of the bird tell you
speak
the gods
they came from above
the gods
they appeared and laid waste
to the men my king
the gods
the gods
they protected the slave
who travels with the oracle
the gods fight on their behalf sire
if the men hear of this
there will be panic
i know i know
in peace sons bury their fathers
in war fathers bury their sons
are we at war father
i have important information
for the council
theseus
i know this man let him through
i hope youve come to join the fight
wheres the army
tell me about the slave
hes from your village is he not
answer me
yes
he was a peasant
as was i
forgive me your majesty
i meant no
quiet
and his family
his mother was raped by some villagers
nobody would many her
he was a bastard
and his name
theseus
very well ill meet him
helios tells me you have information
that could be of use to us
hyperion is in possession
of the epirus bow
the epirus bow
yes its a weapon forged by heracles
oh please i heard the same stories
you did as a child
there are gods living in the clouds
titans buried in the rocks
listen i was a disbeliever just like
you are but the epirus bow exists
i understand there are many hellenics
who put faith in the myths and the gods
but we on the hellenic council do not
they are metaphors son nothing more
we are a society of laws
based on negotiation and reason
if you try and negotiate with hyperion
you will be the death of us all
if i were to accept your counsel
theseus from kolpos what would it be
seal the gates and prepare for war
we have hoplite battalions returning
we cant seal the gate
no one will return we are the last
im sure youll understand
if i dont accept the advice
of an alluring palm reader
and her peasant lover
sir a heraklion envoy approaches
there you see no ruler wishes for war
they only wish to be taken seriously
at the bargaining table
alert the council prepare a delegation
bows
stop
stop remain still
or well be forced to fire upon you
extend your arms outward
he bears the olive branch of peace
my king wishes to speak
to the one called theseus from kolpos
theseus
hyperions envoy
desires a word with you
like the vision
he sends for you with arms open
seeking an embrace of loyalty
phaedra
have you never been wrong
we cant protect you beyond this gate
i am theseus
come closer i have a message for you
dont risk it
at worst you lose a peasant
better
uhhuh yes
why do you cover your face
all are equal in hyperions midst
i myself am only a vessel
for his demands nothing more
and he asks me by name
indeed he does
and how does he know it
theres little the king does not know
he knows that you have no father
and like him you were cast aside
by your own people
does he know of my rage
does he know that i live only to see
his blood at the end of my sword
does he know he butchered my mother
now that hes seen your face he knows
you wouldnt make it
coward
embrace me theseus
they will never give you a seat
at their table
but you could sit at the head of mine
long after this war is over my mark
will be left on this world forever
the sun will never set
on my blood theseus
this is what i offer you immortality
deeds are eternal not the flesh
the gods may be on your side
but tomorrow
i unleash the titans
what was discussed
seal the gate
what were his demands
seal the gate
theseus
ahh
that was him wasnt it
i was that close
i dont know if i can do
what zeus asks of me
by doubting one
comes the truth theseus
the gods chose well
sir theres movement on the front
what is he holding
the bow
the commanders
are all dead fall back
hold stand your ground
hold stand your ground
listen to me
listen
who are you to tell us what to do
i am nobody to tell you what to do
i am theseus a common man one of you
i share your blood
and i share your fear
but to run now would offer our souls
and the souls of our children
to a terrible darkness
hold we must stand and fight
their numbers count for nothing
in the tunnel stand your ground
stand your ground
who are they that we are not
just because they scald their faces
and scar their bodies
does not mean they are braver
or stronger than we are
they are cowards
they hide behind their masks
they are human
and they bleed like you and i
listen to me
stand your ground
fight for honor
fight for the man beside you
fight for the mothers who bore you
fight for your children
fight for your future
fight so your name survives
fight
for immortality
let us write history
with heraklion blood
ready move
king hyperion
we can negotiate i see no reason
theseus

witness hell
all mens
souls are immortal
but the souls of the righteous
are immortal and divine

to save mankind
and earned a place amongst the gods
they rewarded his
bravery with a gift
a son acamas
