long before man or beast
roamed these lands   
there was a war in the heavens 
immortals  once thought
incapable of death   
discovered they had the power
to kill one another 
  lost in this war was a weapon 
the epirus bow 
the victors declared themselves gods
while the vanquished
were renamed titans 
and forever imprisoned
within the bowels of mount tartarus 
eons passed  mankind flourished 
and the great war
receded from memory 
but the evil that once was   
has re emerged 
stop  you cannot enter here 
this is sacred ground 
sacred for who 
what do you want with us 
where is the virgin oracle 
defile this house further
and you will risk the wrath of the gods 
the gods 
gods 
gods 
go ahead  call upon them 
pray  ask for their help 
pray to the same gods
who idly stood by   
as my wife and my children
were stricken by disease 
i  too  cried to the heavens for help 
but instead of mercy 
i was met with silence 
and the wretched sight of my family   
suffering like animals
until their deaths 
your gods will no longer mock me 
i will release the titans 
it s not too late to end this madness 
salvation can be yours  if you wish it 
let me enlighten you  priest 
i will end the reign of gods 
you wield that ax well  theseus 
maybe someday we ll see you use
the same determination to find a wife 
are you conspiring with my mother now 
she worries about you 
there s no need to worry about me 
you know  being a warrior   
is not just being able to strike
your opponent down with a sword 
it s finding good reason
to draw your sword in the first place 
i draw my sword
to protect those that i love 
what about the others 
  the others turn their backs on me 
  the weak 
the defenseless 
who s going to protect them 
careful  too much worrying
will make you an old man 
  whore 
  oh 
last lights for the labyrinth 
last lights for the holy labyrinth 
let the ancestors rest in peace 
theseus   
may the gods be with you 
thank you for the offerings 
another accident 
theseus  maybe one day
you ll join me in prayer 
ask the gods to grant me grandchildren
before i m too old 
mother  your gods are children s
stories  my spear is not 
and you know  mother  it takes more
than lighting candles to make babies 
besides  our priest
wears a ridiculous hat 
theseus 
mother  stay here 
theseus 
fellow hellenics 
it is with great concern
that i stand before you 
the heraklion king  hyperion 
has seized the sibylline monastery 
he is only a day s march from here 
we must evacuate
this village immediately 
we must fight him
at the gates of our village 
silence  please  quiet 
villagers  we stand no chance 
  i said fall in  lysander 
  we stand no chance 
he is weary from battle 
please  we ask that every man  woman
and child gather your belongings 
leave for mount tartarus
seek refuge behind the safety
of the great wall 
there you will be protected 
anyone who needs more time 
the old  the infirm 
we will escort in a day s time 
  only what you can carry 
  prepare your departure 
leave it  it s not essential 
give me that 
leave that 
move along now 
you re with the wrong party 
is this not the caravan
traveling to tartarus 
it is  but you will not
be traveling among us 
go in the morning with your own kind 
my kind 
peasants and undesirables
travel tomorrow 
my kind s blood
is the same color as yours 
  should we spill some to prove it 
  theseus 
mother 
what happens here 
this bastard and his whore mother   
stop  fall back 
fall back 
  put the sword down 
  i will not 
  kill him 
  try  he dies first 
what is it that you want  brother 
it seems as though my kind
travel in the morning 
i want them to have a proper escort 
move again  and i will bury this
in your skull 
  what s your name 
  theseus 
now is not the time
for violence  theseus  let him go 
only if i have your word the rest
of the village will be protected 
you have my word  i will leave
capable men for the caravan tomorrow 
  kill this traitor 
  enough with your spectacle 
restrain him  get him out of my sight 
he s a bastard 
take him away and disarm him 
mother   
save your bloodlust
for heraklion veins  theseus 
join our ranks 
you have been trained well 
i had a good teacher 
i could use men of your skill at our
side to defeat hyperion s legions 
why would i serve you 
you who would so easily abandon us
let s go  mother 
lysander  you re no longer
pan of this army 
relinquish your shield  your spear   
and remain here to travel
with the peasants tomorrow 
  but you saw him   
  it s done 
i ll see you later 
where are your things  old man 
are you not prepared for the march 
such odysseys were meant
for the young and expectant 
not for a worn out old goat like me 
please reconsider 
you know staying here is suicide 
if the heraklions show up 
at least i ll be spared a slow death 
from what i understand 
indecision is not their style 
you are mad 
no 
just tired 
it s not living as such
that s important  theseus 
it s living rightly 
they fight with a ferocity
unlike anything i ve seen 
it was as if they could
see in the darkness 
as though it suited them 
you speak as if they re not human 
they are human 
the heraklions bleed just as we do 
the only difference is
they fight for a belief
which allows them to kill
without restraint 
that is why they will win 
lysander  i thought helios
ordered you disarmed 
he did 
reveal yourself 
reveal yourself 
  father 
  athena 
  zeus 
  no need for formalities 
none of the other gods
are looking  are they 
what 
when you walked up here just now 
you actually looked like a father 
or maybe a grandfather 
we must tread carefully here 
heed the law 
none of the mortals on earth
should witness us in our immortal form 
but  father  you ve come
dangerously close 
you ve been influencing
the boy theseus for years 
yet as one of them  never as a god 
only as his friend 
and why him 
he does not fear danger 
nor pain  defeat  or ridicule 
he fears only the failure to defend
that which he holds so dear 
his loved ones 
if there is one human who could
lead them against hyperion   
it would be theseus 
but it must be his choice 
he s a defector 
he wants to meet the king 
move 
you are a defector  i understand 
  yes  my king 
  i am not your king 
but i wish you to be 
but you are a traitor by definition 
are you not 
what would i want
with a traitor in my midst 
i can tell you of a village
that lies unprotected   
where you can gather young women 
i have plenty of women 
  slaves and weaponry 
  i have plenty of weapons 
what i want is the epirus bow 
like this monastery  i have moved every
precious stone your people worship upon
and i have yet to find it 
have you ever met
a sibylline monk  traitor 
monks of his order are unwavering
in their obedience to the virgin oracle 
with the right prodding  the oracle
could see where the bow rests 
couldn t she  monk 
tell me where she is 
i know of your faith  monk 
sybellines are forbidden to take a life
under any circumstance   
even their own 
you have no choice
but to tell me what i want to know 
a monk can be made to talk
with or without his tongue 
give him to the beast  make him tell you
where the oracle is being kept 
do you have any children 
not yet 
a man s seed can be
his most brutal weapon 
for generations  your people will
stare into the eyes of their sons
and they will see my likeness 
i will be remembered
in every glance  every smile 
every tear that is shed for eternity 
but before your baptism 
understand that you are not
drawn here to my flame on instinct 
but you ran here
because you are a coward 
and the world does not need
any more cowards 
so  i shall do this world a great favor 
mark you as one of us   
and rid you of your ability
to populate the earth 
traitor 
although you will not hear them   
your forefathers weep
from their graves   
for the future of their bloodline   
ends with you here tonight 
old man 
old man 
hello 
your anger rules you  theseus 
you must learn to master your emotions 
rhythm  theseus  rhythm 
you  burn that down 
get over here 
  no 
  huh 
theseus 
wait 
witness hell 
no 
no 
no 
not him 
no 
give him to the jailer 
he can work in the salt mines 
his pain has just begun
hyperion s legions
show no mercy 
they have destroyed every holy shrine
in their quest for the epirus bow 
it is only a matter of time
before they find it 
i ve noticed their king
takes the greatest care
with all women who carry a child 
and personally sees
to their slaughter 
he ventures to eradicate
a hellenic future 
they honor no rules of engagement 
effective  at least thus far 
effective 
  cowardly 
  that may be   
but the hellenics have yet to adapt 
and until they do   
isn t it time to intervene  zeus 
how can you stomach bearing witness
to such atrocity whilst doing nothing 
i obey the law  no god shall interfere
in the affairs of man
unless the titans are released 
if we are to expect mankind
to have faith in us 
then we must have faith in them 
we must allow them
to use their own free will 
and what if they unearth the bow 
if any of you come to the aid of man
or otherwise influence
the affairs of mankind as a god
the punishment will be death 
who are they 
the virgin oracles  the heraklions
must have found their temple 
  you don t know of them 
  i don t 
i wouldn t mind knowing them all
for a night 
when cloudless
skies thunder  stand fast 
you were a thief 
i am a thief  my lady 
were it not for these chains 
i d steal your heart 
tonight we must flee this place 
whichever are strong enough to fight 
and that man there 
he didn t even go for the water 
he won t make it till morning 
just be ready 
stay apart 
inside 
stay alive 
only one of them is the true oracle 
a seer  she is pure 
the others are there
to protect her identity 
the virgin oracle is blessed
with visions of the future 
were she to be violated 
her gift of prophecy would be corrupted 
what a waste 
  guards 
  keys 
you should get some sleep 
do you know  i am stronger than i look 
i ll be fine 
perhaps   
perhaps you have
trouble sleeping because   
you re haunted by your visions 
a warrior who reads minds 
some people do consider
my visions to be a gift 
gift  how can it be considered a gift
when you can see the future but you
don t have the power to change it 
sony 
why would you do such a thing 
you risked your life
to save a complete stranger 
only a faithless man
would ask such a question 
my mother was a woman of faith
and her gods were absent
when she needed them the most 
as was i 
so we both mourn 
you for what has passed and   
and i for what is to come 
what happened to them 
i gave an order
for them not to be touched 
they tried to flee  my king 
seven of our best men
were killed in the struggle 
seven of your best men killed by women 
i wish to know where
the epirus bow rests 
which of you can tell me this 
which of you are the true oracle 
if i m forced to son you out
by other means
you will experience discomfort 
discomfort unique to your gender 
so you tell me  which one of you is her 
i am the one you seek 
no  it is i 
i am the one you seek 
the other one said the same thing 
they all claim to be the oracle 
the other one 
yes  my king 
the other one  what other one 
there were four of them 
one of them escaped 
with a group of slaves
from the watering hole 
  mondragon 
  sire 
find the one that escaped 
bring her to me alive 
the dark seas 
these waters are thick with oil 
  and the boat 
  it s a heraklion merchant ship 
our best bet is to ambush it
and head south 
  south is not our journey
  it is for me 
from what i hear   
the women down there can get
to the meat of a malaccan chestnut
with only their tongues 
shall you and i test the limits
of that desire  my dear 
the gods have given me vision  yet all
you do is dream of your appetites 
i d rather follow my appetites
than the hallucinations of a harlot 
  she s a high priestess 
  it doesn t matter to me 
high priestess or whore 
i m heading south 
was it something i said 
well  friend  what will it be 
south with me  or will you follow   
the lady 
neither 
i m taking that ship north 
to hyperion s camp at the monastery 
your savior sounds a lot
like a madman to me  your highness 
personally  i d rather fight
with a madman than against one 
are you minding this 
that is the mortal
your father so extols  is it not 
and he is with the oracle 
poseidon  if zeus were to suspect you 
we will come to your defense 
the rear 
i thought you said
this was a merchant ship 
i guess i was wrong 
the sea has forever been
an unpredictable domain 
when the cloudless skies thunder   
stand fast 
  we gotta jump now 
  stand fast 
you knew that wave would save us 
what i see is only a glimmer
of what may come to pass 
your actions and desires
shape what lies ahead 
what else have you seen 
a body wrapped in a shroud on a rock 
you holding the epirus bow   
and   
embracing hyperion  impossible 
i would never embrace hyperion 
he killed my mother 
your mother 
was she given a proper burial 
no 
she still lies
where hyperion cut her down 
then you must bury your mother 
her faith demands it 
i do not believe in the gods 
but she believed 
she believed  theseus 
you must return to your village 
have you found the oracle 
we did  my lord  but our men were lost
before we could recover her 
a storm swept them to sea 
and the oracle 
did she survive 
she travels towards kolpos
with the slaves 
she could be leading them to the bow 
mm 
send the beast to kolpos
we will go to tartarus 
  mondragon 
  sire 
you stay here   
and set an ambush in the pit 
i m sorry i couldn t
protect you  mother 
but i promise you our family name
will not die with me 
hyperion s legions
are gathering at tartarus 
that s where hellenes will fall 
that future is not set 
but likely  it will be a slaughter 
  you have no faith 
  heathens 
that is true  dareios  but not always 
when i was just a boy 
i prayed to the gods    for a horse 
the gods never answered me 
so i stole one instead 
we re surrounded by heathens 
it s all right  it s all right  theseus 
what happened to me 
your arm  you were poisoned 
where are the others 
they re putting dareios  body to rest 
she was right 
for all those years  i doubted her 
doubted their existence 
your mother s death
was not in vain  theseus 
it was fate that brought you back 
for the bow 
and in your hands  theseus   
it will bring hellenes victory 
you were right  theseus 
my visions are a curse 
i want to see the world
through my own eyes 
and feel with my own heart 
and touch with my own flesh 
hey  monk  i did a little shopping
last night  good weapon  huh 
good to you see you re still alive 
i was worried that cow
had gotten the best of you 
it almost did  she saved my life 
looks like she did more than that 
careful 
just because you have that bow doesn t
mean i m going to treat you differently 
good  we march to the monastery 
we have a war to fight 
the faithful believe the titans
are still buried deep within the mountain 
the great wall is the hellenics 
only hope against your army 
defenses 
originally it was a dam 
but the hellenics have since adapted it 
no one could have anticipated the enemy
you have become 
how many are there 
how many have made it here 
your majesty  i m not sure 
how many 
i m not sure  your majesty 
  eight hundred 
  and the gate 
twenty feet of marble stone 
weighing over 12 tons 
it was designed to be impenetrable 
your majesty 
have you ever known of a gate
designed to be anything but 
go be of service somewhere else
where is he  i thought hyperion
was supposed to be camped here 
we should continue  tartarus is another
two days along this ridge 
what is that sound 
stay down  monk  stavros  help me 
help me keep him down 
no  no 
my sisters  my sisters 
they re in the bull 
no 
  i am the true oracle 
  it s me  phaedra 
i am the oracle 
theseus 
they re still here 
wait  monk 
it s a trap 
monk 
theseus 
do not stop until you reach tartarus
the horses will run
until their hearts give out 
hyperion will soon have the bow  leave 
forgive me  father  forgive me 
i only broke the law
to protect the mortal 
no god will ever again come to your aid 
you are on your own 
do you understand  mortal 
i have faith in you  theseus 
prove me right 
lead your people 
halt 
the horse i prayed for when i was a boy 
what is wrong with him 
they re dying 
where are the men 
they have yet to return  sire 
what does the sight
of the bird tell you 
speak 
the gods 
they came from above 
the gods 
they appeared and laid waste
to the men  my king 
the gods 
the gods 
they protected the slave
who travels with the oracle 
the gods fight on their behalf  sire 
if the men hear of this 
there will be panic 
i know  i know 
in peace  sons bury their fathers 
in war  fathers bury their sons 
are we at war  father 
i have important information
for the council 
theseus 
i know this man  let him through 
i hope you ve come to join the fight 
where s the army 
tell me about the slave 
he s from your village  is he not 
  answer me 
  yes 
he was a peasant 
as was i 
forgive me  your majesty 
  i meant no   
  quiet 
and his family 
his mother was raped by some villagers 
nobody would many her 
he was a bastard 
and his name 
theseus 
very well  i ll meet him 
helios tells me you have information
that could be of use to us 
hyperion is in possession
of the epirus bow 
  the epirus bow 
  yes  it s a weapon forged by heracles 
oh  please  i heard the same stories
you did as a child 
there are gods living in the clouds 
titans buried in the rocks 
listen  i was a disbeliever just like
you are  but the epirus bow exists
i understand there are many hellenics
who put faith in the myths and the gods 
but we on the hellenic council do not 
they are metaphors  son  nothing more 
we are a society of laws
based on negotiation and reason 
if you try and negotiate with hyperion 
you will be the death of us all 
if i were to accept your counsel 
theseus from kolpos  what would it be 
seal the gates and prepare for war 
we have hoplite battalions returning 
we can t seal the gate 
no one will return  we are the last 
i m sure you ll understand
if i don t accept the advice
of an alluring palm reader
and her peasant lover 
sir  a heraklion envoy approaches 
there  you see  no ruler wishes for war 
they only wish to be taken seriously
at the bargaining table 
alert the council  prepare a delegation 
bows 
stop 
stop  remain still 
or we ll be forced to fire upon you 
extend your arms outward 
he bears the olive branch of peace 
my king wishes to speak
to the one called theseus from kolpos 
theseus 
hyperion s envoy
desires a word with you 
like the vision 
he sends for you with arms open 
seeking an embrace of loyalty 
phaedra 
have you never been wrong 
we can t protect you beyond this gate 
i am theseus 
come closer  i have a message for you 
don t risk it 
at worst  you lose a peasant 
  better 
  uh huh  yes 
why do you cover your face 
all are equal in hyperion s midst 
i myself am only a vessel
for his demands  nothing more 
  and he asks me by name 
  indeed he does 
and how does he know it 
there s little the king does not know 
he knows that you have no father 
and like him  you were cast aside
by your own people 
does he know of my rage 
does he know that i live only to see
his blood at the end of my sword 
does he know he butchered my mother 
now that he s seen your face  he knows 
you wouldn t make it 
coward 
embrace me  theseus 
they will never give you a seat
at their table
but you could sit at the head of mine 
long after this war is over  my mark
will be left on this world forever 
the sun will never set
on my blood  theseus 
this is what i offer you  immortality 
deeds are eternal  not the flesh 
the gods may be on your side 
but tomorrow   
i unleash the titans 
what was discussed 
seal the gate 
  what were his demands 
  seal the gate 
theseus 
ahh   
  that was him  wasn t it 
  i was that close 
i don t know if i can do
what zeus asks of me 
by doubting one
comes the truth  theseus 
the gods chose well 
sir  there s movement on the front 
what is he holding 
the bow 
the commanders
are all dead  fall back 
hold  stand your ground 
hold  stand your ground 
listen to me 
listen 
  who are you to tell us what to do 
  i am nobody to tell you what to do 
i am theseus  a common man  one of you 
i share your blood 
and i share your fear 
but to run now would offer our souls
and the souls of our children
to a terrible darkness 
hold  we must stand and fight 
their numbers count for nothing
in the tunnel  stand your ground 
stand your ground 
who are they that we are not 
just because they scald their faces
and scar their bodies   
does not mean they are braver
or stronger than we are 
they are cowards 
they hide behind their masks 
they are human 
and they bleed like you and i 
listen to me 
stand your ground 
fight for honor 
fight for the man beside you 
fight for the mothers who bore you 
fight for your children 
fight for your future 
fight so your name survives 
fight   
for immortality 
let us write history
with heraklion blood 
ready  move 
king hyperion 
we can negotiate  i see no reason   
theseus 
here i am  theseus of kolpos 
  where s your king 
  he is no king 
stavros  the shrine 
theseus  i m right behind you 
phaedra 
phaedra 
stay in the shrine 
hyperion 
no 
theseus  wake up 
theseus 
theseus 
theseus 
i got the bow 
stavros

get out of here while you can 
i ll hold them off 
stavros 
go now  i got the bow 
i ll hold them off while i can 
get out of here  go 
which one of you are coming with me 
none of you will leave this place 
leave here 
this is no longer your fight 
find hyperion 
die with your gods 
athena 
father 
don t forsake mankind 
what does it feel like  knowing   
knowing that there ll
be no memory of you 
i have won 
my death will make me a legend 
my deeds   
will go down in history 
i m writing your history 
do it 
this    is our last embrace  hyperion 
look at me 
look at me 
i m the last thing   
you will ever see 
witness hell 
all men s
souls are immortal 
but the souls of the righteous
are immortal and divine 
once a faithless man 
theseus gave his life
to save mankind
and earned a place amongst the gods 
they rewarded his
bravery with a gift 
a son  acamas 
don t be afraid of your visions 
little one 
  what s your name 
  acamas 
acamas 
a strong name 
i knew your father 
he was a very brave man 
soon  it will be your time
my time for what 
the fight against evil
never ends  acamas 
war is coming to the heavens 
and your father will be there 
fighting for your future 
acamas
