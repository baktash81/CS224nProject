last will and testament of
dr nawal marwan
opening of the will to
her two children
simon marwan and jeanne marwan
in accordance with the will
regulations and rights of
nawal marwan
the notary jean lebel
is named executor
hmm  i must tell you here
that it was your mothers decision
i was personally against
it but she insisted
you know
your mother was more
than an employee
to my late wife and me
you felt more like part
of our family so
i could not refuse
hum
all my assets are to be
shared between the twins
jeanne and simon marwan
the money is to be equitably
shared
my furniture distributed by
mutual agreement
burial
notary jean lebel will
bury me without a coffin naked
and without prayers
my face turned towards the ground
my back against the world
tombstone and epitaph
no headstone is to be
placed on my grave
and my name engraved nowhere
no epitaph is deserved for those
who do not keep their promises
to jeanne and simon
childhood is like a knife
stuck in the throat
which cannot be removed easily
jeanne notary lebel will
hand you an envelope
this envelope is for your father
find him
and hand him the envelope
simon the notary will
hand you an envelope
ive heard enough
oh  but its not finished
continue
simon the notary will
hand you an envelope
this envelope is for your brother
find him and hand it to him
when these envelopes
have been handed
to their addressees a
letter will be given to you
when the silence is broken
and the promise kept
a stone may be placed
on my grave
and my name engraved on
the stone
i admit its a bit strange
is there stuff to sign
no not today
ok
thank you jean
shall we
wait
you know the history
of our father
you know we have no brother
why did you let her write this
i understand your surprise
its  its very surprising
stop pretending to be innocent
we know that we speak of there is
nothing surprising in this
we did not make these
things up simon
they are part of a will
theres that too
well this morning your mother
gave us something rather special
well sleep on it then
well meet again huh
ill wait outside
thank you jean
sit down simon
look jean
your secretary she loved
working for you
she did this well all her
life congratulations
your secretary however was also
my mother
then her job as a mother
thats another story
simon
you can bury your secretary
in any way you wish
but my mother i want her
buried in the normal way
for once in your fucking life
make it something normal
this is not negotiable
take your time
and come see me when simon
has calmed down
i know its very unusual but
your mother was not crazy jeanne
we have a large family now
she spoke of a traitor
in a big family theres always a dog
how long will it be before we
find the traitor
fucking crazy woman
ill fix that with jean
fix what
well give her a
normal funeral
well take care of her then
ill take care of you
where are you going
you bury her any way you like
oh stop
you feel guilty because
you were not there
when she died
you feel guilty because
you were there
when she had her accident
you need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything
i am not feeling guilty
about anything
do you realize the significance of
what he just read
well shes gone
its over im at peace
i have fucking peace
im at peace now
yes i see
mathematics as you
have known so far
have aimed to achieve a precise
and definitive response
to precise and definitive problems
now you are about to enter into
entirely different adventure
the subject will be
intractable problems
that will always lead
to other problems just
as intractable
people around you will
repeatedly insist
that what you are doing is
hopeless
youll have no argument
to defend yourself
because they will be of an
overwelming complexity
welcome to pure mathematics
the land of loneliness
this is my assistant
miss jeanne marwan
hello
we will start with the conjecture
of syracuse
what does your intuition
tell you
your intuition is always right
thats why you got potential
to becoming a real mathematician
but over there youll need help
do you have any family there
contacts
its ridiculous niv
youve come to learn that
a your father is alive
and b you have another brother
this is ridiculous
what is ridiculous to question
the inevitable
you need to know
otherwise your mind
will never be at peace
and peace of mind has nothing to
do with pure mathematics
you need a starting point
my father died during
the war in daresh
thats the unknown variable
in the equation
you never start with the
unknown variable
my mother used to speak about
a village
called der om in fouad
she graduated in french
at the university of daresh
if she studied there is hope
said haidar
youll go knock on the
door said haidar
an old friend of mine who
teaches at daresh
you can trust him
what are you doing
mom are you okay
madam thats my towel please
mom
mom
mom
what happened
wheres jeanne
mom
does she suffer from migraines
no
memory loss
no
loss of balance
no
absentminded
shes always absent
no she was never absent
wahab come
just get out of my sisters way
son of refugees where do you
think youre going
nicolas stop
go back to your country
wahab
well leave your hide
in your camps believe me

i want to kill her
its mine to do
you have sullied the
family honor
enough

you have sullied the
name of our family
why god have you plunged
us in the dark
my god what have you done

child safe

shh
shh
look carefully at your mother
youll have to recognize her
ill find you one day
i promise you my heart
be careful
dont worry
come on its time
for you to go
i feel that something terrible
is coming
one day ill find you my son
i received a message
from my friend niv cohen
but i cant help you
because at the time
i taught
history of mathematics
in paris
specifically the period
where euler had
succeeded
to give the first
formal mathematical resolution
to the problem of the seven bridges
of konigsberg yes
diderot defied the court
saying
gentlemen
ift plus
equals zero
so god exists
niv niv niv
hello do you speak french
yes of course
can i help you
uh yes i am looking for someone
who would have known this woman
she studied here maybe
35 years ago
are you kidding me
i wasnt even born
well youre in the wrong
place
im not kidding
im sure you know someone
who can help me
i have come from far away
please her name is nawal marwan
you are very kind
im not nice i want
to get rid of you
najat thats me
you have time to waste
that tells me something
she may have worked in the
campus newspaper
its been a long time
people who leave usually
change identities
it is striking nonetheless
your mother was photographed
in kfar ryat
look here
this is a sign of kfar ryat
it is a prison in the south
you do not know kfar ryat
no
youre definitely not from
here
you dont know the south
if the international community
does not intervene now
the refugees in overcrowded
camps at the border will be
massacred
she has arrived
ok
we the students are oppose
against the nationalist party
that are trying to evict the refugees
across the borders
the national party supports
militias of the christian right
who make open threats against
the refugees
in the south the refugees
are now armed
and have the support
of much of the countrys muslim
population
but you youre a christian
we are for peace
religion has nothing
to do with it
nawal
put the radio
theyve come to close
the university
the nationalists have
closed the campus
nawal come back
stay here
uncle charbel the nationalists
are closing the campus
there will be clashes
stay with me
there is shooting outside
to the table girls
mom theyre attacking
the university
its not a reason not to eat
aioua
christian villages were attacked
in the south this morning
may god protect us
thats why they closed
the university
in short time it will
explode here as well
well go to the mountain
until it calms down
for how long
we start tomorrow
the rest of the family
is already there
and the school
anyway the school will close
only god knows how long
and le journal
dont be afraid
le journal can survive without
us for a while
but ideas only survive if someone
is there to defend them
exactly rafqa
exactly
there are only two orphanages
in the region
i will join you soon
you will not go there now
you had promised grandma you
would finish your studies
you heard your father
its going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps
the studies are finished
i think of him every day
thats my child
i want to find him alive
im going to fetch
water from shadia
hurry nawal
your name
nawal
nawal what
nawal marwan
where are you going
south
what for
to meet my husband
wahab

the older boys are in kfar
kout
you should go with us
kfar kout was attacked
yesterday
looking for the orphanage
you know where is it
there
the children
where are the children
you should speak with those
who were there
the muslim villagers fled
to the camp deressa
they fear reprisals will come
the children may be with them
chamseddine and his men killed all the
christians to avenge the refugees
perhaps the children are in deressa
