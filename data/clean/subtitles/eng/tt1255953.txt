last will and testament of
dr  nawal marwan 
opening of the will to
her two children 
simon marwan and jeanne marwan 
 in accordance with the will 
regulations and rights of
nawal marwan 
the notary  jean lebel 
is named executor  
hmm     i must tell you here
that it was your mother s decision 
i was personally against
it  but she insisted 
you know    
    your mother was more
than an employee 
to my late wife and me
you felt more like part
of our family  so    
i could not refuse 
hum 
 all my assets are to be
shared between the twins 
jeanne and simon marwan  
 the money is to be equitably
shared 
 my furniture distributed by
mutual agreement  
 burial 
 notary jean lebel will
bury me without a coffin  naked
and without prayers  
 my face turned towards the ground 
my back against the world  
 tombstone and epitaph 
 no headstone is to be
placed on my grave
and my name engraved nowhere  
 no epitaph is deserved for those
who do not keep their promises  
 to jeanne and simon 
 childhood is like a knife
stuck in the throat
which cannot be removed easily  
 jeanne  notary lebel will
hand you an envelope  
 this envelope is for your father  
 find him
and hand him the envelope  
 simon  the notary will
hand you an envelope  
i ve heard enough 
oh     but it s not finished 
continue 
 simon  the notary will
hand you an envelope  
 this envelope is for your brother  
 find him and hand it to him  
 when these envelopes
have been handed
to their addressees  a
letter will be given to you  
 when the silence is broken 
and the promise kept
a stone may be placed
on my grave
and my name engraved on
the stone  
i admit it s a bit strange 
is there stuff to sign 
no  not today 
ok 
thank you  jean 
  shall we 
  wait 
you know  the history
of our father 
you know  we have no brother 
why did you let her write this 
i understand your surprise 
it s     it s very surprising 
stop pretending to be innocent 
we know that we speak of  there is
nothing surprising in this 
we did not make these
things up  simon   
they are part of a will 
there s that  too 
well  this morning your mother
gave us something rather special 
we ll sleep on it  then    
we ll meet again  huh 
i ll wait outside 
thank you  jean 
sit down  simon 
look  jean    
your secretary  she loved
working for you 
she did this well all her
life  congratulations 
your secretary  however  was also
my mother 
then her job as a mother 
that s another story 
simon    
you can bury your secretary
in any way you wish 
but my mother  i want her
buried in the normal way 
for once in your fucking life
make it something normal 
this is not negotiable 
take your time 
and come see me when simon
has calmed down 
i know it s very unusual  but    
your mother was not crazy  jeanne 
we have a large family now 
she spoke of a traitor 
in a big family  there s always a dog 
how long will it be before we
find the traitor 
fucking crazy woman 
i ll fix that with jean 
fix what 
we ll give her a
normal funeral 
we ll take care of her  then
i ll take care of you 
where are you going 
you bury her any way you like 
oh  stop 
you feel guilty because
you were not there
when she died 
you feel guilty because
you were there
when she had her accident 
you need to stop you feeling
guilty for everything 
i am not feeling guilty
about anything 
do you realize the significance of
what he just read 
well  she s gone 
it s over  i m at peace 
i have fucking peace 
i m at peace now 
yes  i see 
mathematics as you
have known so far
have aimed to achieve a precise
and definitive response
to precise and definitive problems 
now  you are about to enter into
entirely different adventure 
the subject will be
intractable problems
that will always lead
to other problems just
as intractable 
people around you will
repeatedly insist
that what you are doing is
hopeless 
you ll have no argument
to defend yourself 
because they will be of an
overwelming complexity 
welcome to pure mathematics 
the land of loneliness 
this is my assistant 
miss jeanne marwan 
hello 
we will start with the conjecture
of syracuse 
what does your intuition
tell you 
your intuition is always right 
that s why you got potential
to becoming a real mathematician 
but over there  you ll need help 
do you have any family there 
  contacts 
  it s ridiculous  niv 
you ve come to learn that
a  your father is alive 
and b  you have another brother 
this is ridiculous
what is ridiculous to question
the inevitable 
you need to know 
otherwise  your mind
will never be at peace 
and peace of mind has nothing to
do with pure mathematics 
you need a starting point 
my father died during
the war in daresh 
that s the unknown variable
in the equation 
you never start with the
unknown variable 
my mother used to speak about
a village
called der om  in fouad 
she graduated in french
at the university of daresh 
if she studied  there is hope 
said haidar 
you ll go knock on the
door said haidar
an old friend of mine who
teaches at daresh 
you can trust him 
what are you doing 
mom  are you okay 
madam  that s my towel  please 
mom 
mom 
mom 
what happened 
where s jeanne 
mom 
does she suffer from migraines 
no 
  memory loss 
  no 
loss of balance 
no 
absent minded 
she s always absent 
no  she was never absent 
wahab  come 
just get out of my sister s way 
son of refugees  where do you
think you re going

wahab

in your camps  believe me

  it s mine to do 
you have sullied the
family honor 
  enough

outside 
what have you done 
you have humilliated us 
you have sullied the
name of our family 
why god have you plunged
us in the dark 
my god  what have you done 
why did you do that 
what will i do with you 
you want me to kill you 
i m pregnant  grandma

do i have to kill you 
what will i do with you 
come

child safe 
listen to me 
there s nothing here for you 
i ll help after the birth 
i want you to go away 
you ll go to live with
your uncle charbel 
there  you ll go to school 
to learn to read 
to learn to think
out of this misery 
promise me and i ll help you 
promise me you ll go to school 
i promise you  grandmother 
i promise 
shh 
shh 
look carefully at your mother 
you ll have to recognize her 
i ll find you one day 
i promise you  my heart 
be careful 
don t worry 
come on  it s time
for you to go 
i feel that something terrible
is coming    
one day i ll find you  my son 
i received a message
from my friend niv cohen
but i can t help you
because at the time 
i taught
history of mathematics
in paris 
specifically  the period
where euler had
succeeded
to give the first
formal mathematical resolution
to the problem of the seven bridges
of konigsberg  yes 
diderot defied the court
saying 
 gentlemen     
i ft plus
equals zero 
so  god exists  
niv  niv  niv    
hello  do you speak french 
  yes  of course 
  can i help you 
uh  yes  i am looking for someone
who would have known this woman 
she studied here maybe
35 years ago 
are you kidding me 
i wasn t even born 
well  you re in the wrong
place   
i m not kidding 
i m sure you know someone
who can help me 
i have come from far away 
please  her name is nawal marwan 
you are very kind 
i m not nice  i want
to get rid of you 
najat  that s me 
you have time to waste 
that tells me something 
she may have worked in the
campus newspaper 
it s been a long time 
people who leave usually
change identities 
it is striking nonetheless 
your mother was photographed
in kfar ryat 
look here 
this is a sign of kfar ryat 
it is a prison in the south 
you do not know kfar ryat 
  no 
you re definitely not from
here 
you don t know the south 
if the international community
does not intervene now
the refugees in overcrowded
camps at the border    will be
massacred 
she has arrived 
ok 
we  the students  are oppose
against the nationalist party
that are trying to evict the refugees
across the borders 
the national party supports
militias of the christian right 
who make open threats against
the refugees 
in the south  the refugees
are now armed 
and have the support
of much of the country s muslim
population 
but you    you re a christian 
we are for peace 
religion has nothing
to do with it 
nawal 
put the radio 
they ve come to close
the university 
the nationalists have
closed the campus 
nawal  come back 
stay here 
uncle charbel  the nationalists
are closing the campus 
there will be clashes 
stay with me 
there is shooting outside    
to the table  girls 
mom  they re attacking
the university 
it s not a reason not to eat 
aioua 
christian villages were attacked
in the south this morning 
may god protect us 
that s why they closed
the university 
in short time  it will
explode here as well 
we ll go to the mountain
until it calms down 
for how long 
we start tomorrow 
the rest of the family
is already there 
and the school 
anyway  the school will close 
only god knows how long 
and le journal 
don t be afraid 
le journal can survive without
us for a while 
but ideas only survive if someone
is there to defend them 
exactly  rafqa 
exactly 
there are only two orphanages
in the region 
i will join you soon 
you will not go there now 
you had promised grandma you
would finish your studies 
you heard your father 
it s going to explode across the country
if they attack the camps 
the studies are finished 
i think of him every day 
that s my child 
i want to find him alive 
i m going to fetch
water from shadia 
hurry  nawal 
  your name 
  nawal 
  nawal what 
  nawal marwan 
where are you going 
south 
what for 
to meet my husband 
wahab 
you have only daughters 
the older boys are in kfar
kout 
you should go with us 
kfar kout was attacked
yesterday 
looking for the orphanage 
you know where is it 
there 
the children 
where are the children 
you should speak with those
who were there 
the muslim villagers fled
to the camp deressa 
they fear reprisals will come 
the children may be with them 
chamseddine and his men killed all the
christians to avenge the refugees 
perhaps the children are in deressa 
can you take me to the camp in deressa 
i am a christian
