i pulled in here for  
so your car broke down
on the way to your blood check 
yeah  smoke  everything 
i m willing to give you the benefit
of the doubt  javier  but a judge won t 
i missed a couple of meetings 
what s the problem 
i mean 
i don t even know what i m doing here 
you re here because your son has
gotten into fights every day at school 
and the last one sent one of his
classmates to the hospital 
juanita came here for help voluntarily
before the court stepped in
and made it mandatory 
that s what you re doing here 
he s on a dangerous road 
your history  all the violence 
all the anger 
that s his future
unless you break the cycle 
  i heard you  mrs lynch 
  you re trying to steal my boy 
no one is trying to steal your child 
  then what are you trying   
  they found bruises
  and cigarette burns   
  i told you 
he was playing with some sparklers 
mrs lynch  i read the medical report 
i wanna talk to my own doctor 
i want a lawyer 
if you feel
that you need legal representation
  that s perfectly within your rights   
  i don t need your help  in no case 
  you ve already interfered enough 
  you    hello 
  how many active cases you got 
  thirty eight 
  okay 
  wayne  come on

the other day  give me a call 
hey  em  it s jackie  just checking in 
hope you re good 
exhausted 
her career path questionable 
her faith in mankind shaken 
she resisted her tendency
toward introspection
and decides to go have a drink
with her charming friend doug 
  i am so in your head 
  be honest 
the whole psychology thing 
it s just about scoring chicks  isn t it 
regrettably  yes  two 
well  what are we gonna
drink to tonight 
the never ending fun
of a career in public service 
yeah 
you know 
i sit there talking to these families 
the authority on everything 
and i have these moments
where i think i might be totally full of it 
everybody s full of it 
in the end you re a number to call
for people who don t have anyone else 
there s no way that s bad 
anyway  i ve done some soul searching
and i just want to say
that if a full on relationship
feels like too much right now 
i d be willing to consider
a purely physical one 
  what 
  nothing 
  what  you might actually enjoy yourself 
  yeah  yeah  i probably would 
  it s just   
  i know  i know  the job 
you get home  no time for anybody else 
whatever 
listen  i m giving you a month  okay 
one month 
  and then 
  i don t know 
probably give you another month 
but that is it 
except for two more  then  it s over 
if it were anyone   
what are they doing to you 
  what 
  emily jenkins  child services 
we spoke on the phone 
  you said the 17th 
  it s the 17th

  i m sorry  but it is 
monday the 17th 
the day of our appointment 
hi 
come down  i d like to meet you 
my name s emily  what s yours 
  lily 
  that s a pretty name 
is there somewhere we can talk 
so  when are you
expecting your husband back 
because we ve found that it s better
when the whole family participates 
well  he s not here  so   
do you have some way
of contacting him 
not if i don t know where he is 
is that   
would you mind asking him
to join us  please 
  he doesn t have anything to say 
  will you ask him  please 
edward 
that lady is here from the state 
she wants to talk to you 
i don t have anything to say  tell her that 
i told her already  she wants to anyway 
it ll be okay 
hi  i m emily 
okay 
i m here because we received a call
that lilith
is showing serious signs of neglect 
now at this point we can only assume
it s the result of family problems 
eddie says
we don t have family problems 
well  many families won t realise
that they re having problems
until it s too late 
and that s where we come in 
we help families communicate
and learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict 
eddie says we don t need your help 
mr sullivan  is there a reason
why you won t speak to me directly 
is there a reason why your husband
won t speak to me directly 
eddie doesn t like speaking out of anger 
there s no laws
against being weird  em 
i didn t say weird  i said scary 
that man sat there
staring at me the whole time 
and the mother is his emotional slave 
wait  you didn t just fly to new york
and meet with my parents  did you 
wayne 
all right  all right 
are there any cuts  any bruises 
any signs she s being abused 
no  not physically 
but this girl s in trouble  i can feel it 
you wanna know what i can feel 
the lawsuit we re gonna get hit with
if we violate her parents  rights
without any evidence
they ve done something wrong 
all right  wayne 
you put these files on my desk
and you ask me to tell you
what s going on 
i ve told you  i ve done my job 
what you do with it is yours 
we re not perfect parents 
we know that 
but we figure if they know
how much you love them
a lot of the other stuff
takes care of itself 
she knows how we feel about her 
so  tell me  mr sullivan 
since you ve suddenly acquired
the ability to speak 
doesn t it concern you a little
that lily s grades have dropped
from a s to d s in three months 
of course it does  she s our daughter 
so you have no idea why your daughter
falls asleep in class every day 
why she can t sleep at home  no idea 
bad dreams maybe 
don t tell me you re buying
this whole  daddy s little girl  routine 
look  they re not my favourite people
either  okay 
but we can t guarantee every kid
a happy childhood  i wish we could 
let me talk to her 
she wants to talk  alone 
  em  we do not have a case 
  just five minutes  okay 
talk to them
about how much they love kids 
hey  girls  slow down 
i used to wish i had a sister
when i was growing up 
to play with and to talk to
about all those things that you
just can t tell anybody else  you know 
did you ever wish that 
that you had a sister 
well  that was a silly thing to do 
wasn t it 
what s happening with you 
you know i can help  let me help you 
what is it  sweetheart 
they hate me 
i m sure they don t hate you 
they do  i hear them 
they go into the cellar and talk 
what do they talk about 
sending me to hell 
you heard them say that 
you can tell him  he s on your side 
it s okay 
lily  did you hear your parents say
they were gonna hurt you 
i was just thinking about you 
got a nice letter from sandy hutchinson 
well  well  well 
it s sitting right in front of me 
which means our good friend wayne
has decided it fails to meet the criteria
for child endangerment
and has told you in no uncertain terms
to leave it alone 
  surprise  surprise 
  i m sorry  emily  i can t 
please  mike  i m really desperate here 
emily 
now  you know how dear to my heart
the work you do is 
but the department doesn t pay me
to stake out potential child abusers 
last time almost cost me my job 
this little girl heard her parents say
they re going to send her to hell 
sickening as that is 
you re a part of the system that
deals with those situations  i m not 
but sometimes the system doesn t work 
well  maybe you should just let it 
wow  feel like

with you people

the egregiousness of the crime makes
the competency question
all the more relevant 
i hereby order the defendants to
undergo psychiatric evaluation
to determine their fitness for trial 
steal a pizza  san quentin 
try to kill your kid 
freudian dream analysis 
you re gonna hate me for saying this
but my money s on crazy 
what kind of people
put their kid in an oven 
bad people  remember that
when people were just bad 
before everything had a diagnosis
and a justification 
it s human nature 
what s the most important thing
that we talked about
that you have to remember 
it s not my fault what happened 
that s right  you know what  it s not 
good  i ll see you soon 
  hey 
  hi 
that is some seriously proactive
social work happening there 
  you all right 
  yeah  i m fine 
  how s she doing 
  typical reaction 
but she blames herself  we ll get there 
i m gonna put her in a group setting 
see if i can get her to open up 
group therapy for kids 
when am i going to get used to that 
  see you later  okay 
  see you 
hi 
good news  they say you can
get out of here tomorrow 
doug said i might have to go
to a state home 
yeah  but it s only temporary 
till we find you a nice family 
why can t i live with you 
sweetheart  that would
never be allowed 
why 
well  it s complicated  i mean 
there s this whole process 
and i m not even a foster parent  so   
it ll be fine 
  hi  barb 
  hi  em  right this way  little lady 
i ll check in  in a couple of days  okay 
i don t want to stay here 
i want to live with you 
please  i ll be good 
lily  it s impossible  i told you 
will you try 
honey  listen  even if they said yes 
it would never work 
i work all day and
i m hardly ever home and   
i m sorry  i m just not mom material 
how do you know if you ve never tried 
so  it s just until we can find
the right family for her 
just until we can place her
in a really good home 
you know you d have to give up
the case  conflict of interests and all 
yeah 
can i ask you a question 
why are you doing this 
what lily needs right now is
a safe  supportive environment
with someone she trusts 
the system can t provide that for her 
i think that i can 
better than anyone  given my training 
we spend so much of our time
negotiating red tape 
i think if we look at this situation 
this one situation 
this one child 
it s clear what s best for her 
how long till foster services can
place her in a permanent home 
three weeks  three months 
it s hard to predict 
no more visits 
  what 
  they said yes 
it s your new beginning 
okay  it s what i like to think of as
a glass half full situation 
bathroom  kitchen  fish 
and this is your room 
be okay 
  you live alone 
  just me 
just us 
  what s this 
  it s chamomile 
helps me sleep 
you know none of this
should ever have happened 
if i could make it go away  i would 
you did 
here  climb in 
night night 
  okay  all right 
  here we go 
  just got to grab some of her things 
  okay 
  so  here s the key 
  you re not coming 
i got 15 other places i got to be 
so make sure you lock it on the way out 
okay  bye 
the kids at school are
saying all this stuff like saying
my mother is a puta
and i mean  i know
we can t go back home
but i miss it 
sometimes when our parents
aren t getting along 
it s better if they spend some time apart 
that s what a restraining order does 
she s starting to come out of her shell 
it s good 
but you got to expect some hiccups 
and you can t undo
10 years of trauma in six weeks 
school  too soon 
no  i don t have a problem
with her going back 
just as long as she s comfortable with it 
i went by the house 
i think her mom and dad were
barricading themselves
in their room at night 
how sick is that 
well  fear and hatred are
part of the same pathology 
  see you  bye  diego 
  you too  lily 
  but i forgot 
  bye 
  bye 
  you don t think they re crazy 
well  i m coming around 
  i love you 
  love you  too 
  wayne s looking for you 
  okay 
  wayne wants to see you 
  yeah  i got it 
what s up with diego 
oh  hey 
look  why don t we go talk in my office 
no  tell me what s going on 
well  we don t    we don t know why yet
but he killed both his parents last night 
  excuse me    go ahead 
  officer  let her through 
what happened 
gets a tyre iron from the garage 
comes back inside 
locks all the doors and windows 
and kills them in their sleep 
 slaughters  would be a better word 
oh  my god 
a 10 year old did this  there s no way 
i was there when they brought him in 
took three guys to subdue him 
and the kid was climbing the walls 
man s best friend  huh 
what happened 
tell me what happened 
i killed my mom and dad 
every family you sit down with 
every day of every week 
it s a family in crisis 
those are your odds  well 
that s your job  trying to beat them 
you re one person  em 
you can t save the world 
i know somebody you did save 
yeah 
  you okay 
  yeah 
it s just work  don t worry 
  i think you have a hard job 
  so do i 
people have kids and then they decide
they don t want to be parents 
and then the kids grow up
thinking it s their fault 
is that what your parents did 
you said you were alone 
yeah 
i never met my dad 
and my mom    my mom had problems 
  she must have scared you 
  why do you say that 
you don t like to talk about it 
you re a clever little girl 
sweetheart  breakfast 
what you got 
let me see 
you went through my things 
i m sorry  i wanted to know about you 
is that your mother 
what happened to her 
she died when i was about your age 
  how 
  an accident 
it was raining
and she was driving too fast 
we had an accident 
are you mad at me 
no  i m not mad at you 
but i need you
not to do that again  okay 
go through my private things
without asking 
okay  all right 
omelette s getting cold  better hurry 
you watch  six months 
their lawyer will hire an expert
to say they re rehabbed and they ll sue
for custody when they get out 
she s not going back there 
i ll take her out of the state
before i let them near her again 
didn t hear you say that 
you guys okay 
we re great  she s sweet 
very intuitive about everything 
you wanted to talk about something 
we pulled the ramirezes 
phone records 
there was a call that night
before the murder 
  from who 
  the call came from your house  emily 
what 
i m not accusing you of anything 
i just want to know what was said 
but that s impossible 
i mean  i might have called them
the week before or something  but i   
i m talking to you as a friend 
you know that  right 
mike  did you not hear me 
as a friend  i m telling you
that i didn t call that family 
he s in my group 
why  did something happen 
we re trying to figure out why 
diego got a call from here 
last thursday night 
i m just wondering
if he might have said something 
  that wasn t me 
  you didn t call him 
lily  it s difficult sometimes
to tell the truth 
but i know you will
because you re a good kid 
i am telling the truth 
my backup files are in the cabinet 
diego s is in there 
maybe you got curious and went
through some  dialled a number 
it wasn t me  i swear 
the call came at 2 00 a m 
you ever up that late 
  i didn t call him 
  you ever up that late 
mike  she said no 
maybe somebody made a mistake 
yeah  maybe so 
why would diego do this 
he loved his mom and dad 
you never want to think anyone you
know is capable of that kind of thing 
in your mind  it s always some
nameless  faceless creature 
sometimes  the city seems full of them 
but they re just people 
like you and me 
she s lying 
do you believe me 
i believe you 
i need to ask you something
about the night it happened 
did you get a call  really late 
you didn t 
diego  i know that you did 
the call came from my house 
what s the matter 
what s scaring you  diego 
it s okay  it s all right  deep breaths 
deep breaths  you ll be all right 
can we get some help in here  please 
who called you  was it lily 
did she say something to you 
something that scared you 
  el dijo 
   el dijo  
what do you mean   he said  
  era un hombre 
  it was a man 
do you
like working here 
well  photocopying isn t much fun

that s not really what
you want to talk about  is it  doug 
you got me 
question 16  am i afraid of the dark 
you answered no 
question 23  am i afraid of being alone 
you answered no 
26  am i afraid of my parents  no 
you answered no
to everything in that section 
i think that some of those
should have been yeses 
everybody is scared of something 
working through our fears 
conquering them 
is how we get better 
so  i want you to tell me 
what scares you 
i ll tell you what scares me
if you tell me what scares you 
fair enough 
when i was a kid  i was climbing a tree 
and i accidentally put my hand
through a giant hornets  nest 
and they didn t like it 
i was stung over a hundred times 
they had to rush me to the hospital 
been afraid of hornets ever since 
i don t climb many trees either 
everybody has fears 
now  what scares you 
  me 
  you scare yourself 
  sometimes 
  why  what about yourself scares you 
i have bad thoughts 
  about what 
  people 
  people in general or certain people 
  certain people 
  like who 
  you 
you have bad thoughts about me 
  why 
  i just do 
did i do something or say something
that upset you 
it s just the way you are 
how am i 
  facile 
  facile 
do you even know what that means 
easily comprehended 
often lacking sincerity or depth 
you re smug  too 
want me to tell you what that means 
  if i seemed smug or facile i want to   
  don t apologise 
why not 
you re a grown up  it s embarrassing 
number 12 
i worry about what s going to happen 
  yes or no 
  you want me to answer that 
  yes or no 
  no 
that should be a yes 
should we talk about school now 
my grades are getting a lot better 
i talked to a lot of kids  i don t think
i ve ever felt like that before 
like what 
threatened 
i know a specialist 
i m gonna call him in the morning 
are you mad at me 
no  no  i m just tired 
  want me to brush your hair 
  no  thanks
