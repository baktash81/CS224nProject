classmates to the hospital
juanita came here for help voluntarily
before the court stepped in
and made it mandatory

hes on a dangerous road
your history all the violence
all the anger

the neverending fun
of a career in public service

where i think i might be totally full of it
everybodys full of it
in the end youre a number to call
for people who dont have anyone else
theres no way thats bad
anyway ive done some soul searching
and i just want to say
that if a fullon relationship
feels like too much right now
id be willing to consider
a purely physical one

i told her already she wants to anyway
itll be okay
hi im emily
okay
im here because we received a call
that lilith
is showing serious signs of neglect
now at this point we can only assume
its the result of family problems
eddie says
we dont have family problems
well many families wont realise
that theyre having problems
until its too late
and thats where we come in
we help families communicate
and learn healthier ways
of resolving conflict
eddie says we dont need your help
mr sullivan is there a reason
why you wont speak to me directly
is there a reason why your husband
wont speak to me directly
eddie doesnt like speaking out of anger
theres no laws
against being weird em
i didnt say weird i said scary
that man sat there
staring at me the whole time
and the mother is his emotional slave
wait you didnt just fly to new york
and meet with my parents did you
wayne
all right all right
are there any cuts any bruises
any signs shes being abused
no not physically
but this girls in trouble i can feel it
you wanna know what i can feel
the lawsuit were gonna get hit with
if we violate her parents rights
without any evidence
theyve done something wrong
all right wayne
you put these files on my desk
and you ask me to tell you
whats going on
ive told you ive done my job
what you do with it is yours
were not perfect parents
we know that
but we figure if they know
how much you love them
a lot of the other stuff
takes care of itself
she knows how we feel about her
so tell me mr sullivan
since youve suddenly acquired
the ability to speak
doesnt it concern you a little
that lilys grades have dropped
from as to ds in three months
of course it does shes our daughter
so you have no idea why your daughter
falls asleep in class every day
why she cant sleep at home no idea
bad dreams maybe

a happy childhood i wish we could
let me talk to her

steal a pizza san quentin
try to kill your kid
freudian dream analysis
youre gonna hate me for saying this
but my moneys on crazy
what kind of people
put their kid in an oven
bad people remember that
when people were just bad
before everything had a diagnosis
and a justification
its human nature
whats the most important thing
that we talked about
that you have to remember
its not my fault what happened
thats right you know what its not
good ill see you soon
hey
hi
that is some seriously proactive
social work happening there
you all right
yeah im fine
hows she doing
typical reaction
but she blames herself well get there
im gonna put her in a group setting
see if i can get her to open up
group therapy for kids
when am i going to get used to that
see you later okay
see you
hi
good news they say you can
get out of here tomorrow
doug said i might have to go
to a state home
yeah but its only temporary
till we find you a nice family
why cant i live with you
sweetheart that would
never be allowed
why
well its complicated i mean
theres this whole process
and im not even a foster parent so
itll be fine
hi barb
hi em right this way little lady
ill check in in a couple of days okay
i dont want to stay here
i want to live with you
please ill be good
lily its impossible i told you
will you try
honey listen even if they said yes
it would never work
i work all day and
im hardly ever home and
im sorry im just not mom material
how do you know if youve never tried
so its just until we can find
the right family for her
just until we can place her
in a really good home
you know youd have to give up
the case conflict of interests and all
yeah
can i ask you a question
why are you doing this
what lily needs right now is
a safe supportive environment
with someone she trusts
the system cant provide that for her
i think that i can
better than anyone given my training
we spend so much of our time
negotiating red tape
i think if we look at this situation
this one situation
this one child
its clear whats best for her
how long till foster services can
place her in a permanent home
three weeks three months
its hard to predict
no more visits
what
they said yes
its your new beginning
okay its what i like to think of as
a glasshalffull situation
bathroom kitchen fish
and this is your room
be okay
you live alone
just me
just us
whats this
its chamomile
helps me sleep
you know none of this
should ever have happened
if i could make it go away i would
you did
here climb in
night night
okay all right
here we go
just got to grab some of her things
okay
so heres the key
youre not coming
i got 15 other places i got to be
so make sure you lock it on the way out
okay bye
the kids at school are
saying all this stuff like saying
my mother is a puta
and i mean i know
we cant go back home
but i miss it
sometimes when our parents
arent getting along
its better if they spend some time apart
thats what a restraining order does
shes starting to come out of her shell
its good
but you got to expect some hiccups
and you cant undo
10 years of trauma in six weeks
school too soon
no i dont have a problem
with her going back
just as long as shes comfortable with it
i went by the house
i think her mom and dad were
barricading themselves
in their room at night
how sick is that
well fear and hatred are
part of the same pathology
see you bye diego
you too lily
but i forgot
bye
bye
you dont think theyre crazy
well im coming around
i love you
love you too

its just work dont worry
i think you have a hard job
so do i
people have kids and then they decide
they dont want to be parents

thinking its their fault
is that what your parents did

very intuitive about everything
you wanted to talk about something
we pulled the ramirezes
phone records
there was a call that night
before the murder
from who
the call came from your house emily

im not accusing you of anything
i just want to know what was said

the week before or something but i
im talking to you as a friend

lily its difficult sometimes
to tell the truth
but i know you will
because youre a good kid
i am telling the truth
my backup files are in the cabinet
diegos is in there
maybe you got curious and went
through some dialled a number
it wasnt me i swear
the call came at 200 am
you ever up that late
i didnt call him
you ever up that late
mike she said no
maybe somebody made a mistake
yeah maybe so
why would diego do this
he loved his mom and dad
you never want to think anyone you
know is capable of that kind of thing
in your mind its always some
nameless faceless creature
sometimes the city seems full of them
but theyre just people
like you and me
shes lying
do you believe me
i believe you
i need to ask you something
about the night it happened
did you get a call really late
you didnt
diego i know that you did
the call came from my house

question 16 am i afraid of the dark
you answered no
question 23 am i afraid of being alone
you answered no
26 am i afraid of my parents no
you answered no
to everything in that section
i think that some of those
should have been yeses
everybody is scared of something
working through our fears
conquering them
is how we get better
so i want you to tell me
what scares you
ill tell you what scares me
if you tell me what scares you
fair enough
when i was a kid i was climbing a tree
and i accidentally put my hand
through a giant hornets nest
and they didnt like it
i was stung over a hundred times
they had to rush me to the hospital
been afraid of hornets ever since
i dont climb many trees either
everybody has fears
now what scares you
me
you scare yourself
sometimes
why what about yourself scares you
i have bad thoughts
about what
people
people in general or certain people
certain people
like who
you
you have bad thoughts about me
why
i just do
did i do something or say something
that upset you
its just the way you are
how am i
facile
facile
do you even know what that means
easily comprehended
often lacking sincerity or depth
youre smug too
want me to tell you what that means
if i seemed smug or facile i want to
dont apologise
why not
youre a grownup its embarrassing
number 12
i worry about whats going to happen
yes or no
you want me to answer that
yes or no
no
that should be a yes
should we talk about school now

ive ever felt like that before
like what
threatened
i know a specialist
im gonna call him in the morning
