you re the only one who can 
if you would tell the sheriff
that you was with us

that pulled the knife first 
that willie was only defending himself 
they d have to believe you 
copeland  you re being hysterical

willie is  people   and so am l 
and i m asking you to help us 
us 
and you won t do it
