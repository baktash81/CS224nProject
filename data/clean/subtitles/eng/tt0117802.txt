 man 
no way 
 applause  whistling 
 microphone feedback 
 applause continues 
you re nobody
 til somebody loves you
you re nobody
 til somebody cares
you may be king
you may possess the world
and its gold
but gold won t bring you
happiness
when you re growin  old
the world still is the same
you never change it
as sure as the stars
shine above
you re nobody
 til somebody loves you
so find yourself
somebody to love
the world
still is the same
you never change it
as sure as the stars
shine above
but you re nobody
 til somebody loves you
so find yourself
somebody to love
so find yourself
somebody to love
  okay  so what if l don t
want to give up on her 
  you don t call 
  you said l don t call if
l wanted to give up on her 
  right 
  so l don t call either way 
  right 
  so what s the difference 
  there is no difference right now 
see  mike  the only difference
between giving up and not giving up   
is if you take her back
when she wants to come back 
but you can t do anything
to make her want to come back 
ln fact  you can only do stuff
to make her not want to come back 
so the only difference is
if l forget about her or just
pretend to forget about her 
  right 
  well  that sucks 
yeah  it sucks 
so it s like a retroactive
decision then  l mean  l
could  like  forget about her 
and then when she comes back  make like
l just pretended to forget about her 
right  although probably
more likely the opposite 
what do you mean 
l mean  at first you re gonna pretend
to forget about her 
not call her 
l don t know  whatever 
but then  eventually 
you really will forget about her 
  well  unless she comes back first 
  mm  see  that s the thing 
somehow they know not to come back
until you really forget 
  there s the rub 
  there s the rub 
look  man  uh  l l m sorry we always
talk about the same thing all the time 
  ah  no  it s all right 
  lt s just that  you know   
lt s just you been there  man 
  don t sweat it 
  your advice really helps 
and l just  l don t know   
you know  rob  you re the only one
l can talk to about her

themselves for a couple of
high class guys like me and you

 christy 
you were in acapulco beach 
 lisa 
we watch that all the time

   trent  yeah  yeah 
the worst was when l went in for
this afterschool special  right 
so l m sitting
in the waiting room 
and there s all these little kids  uh 
sitting in the waiting room with me 
and l see that all the kids are signed
in for the exact same role as me 
  they re auditioning for
the same role as you 
  right 
so  uh  l check the time and the place 
l m where l m supposed to be 
l call my agent up  she says   trent 
they asked for you specifically  
  what was the thing 
  l don t know what it was 
lt was  drugs are bad  
 jenny eats something   whatever 
lt s afterschool special bullshit 
  right   giggles 
   jenny eats something  
the role l m reading for is  brother  
l m reading for the part of  brother  
big brother
or little brother 
  just brother  man  just brother 
  no 
just brother  right  finally l get
to go in and meet everyone  right 
mikey  l m telling you 
l was money 
lt s a starring role 
l practiced for a week 
so l m reading with the casting director
and  girls  l literally start crying 
  no 
  l swear to god 
the casting director who s reading with
me kinda gets caught up in the vibe 
  she starts crying 
  oh 
  yeah  l swear to god  swear to god 
  wow 
so now she s crying 
l m crying 
we re both kinda crying  but not
the kind of crying that s like   
but the kind of crying that s
like we re trying not to cry 
do you know what l mean  like we re not
trying to    whatever  lt was very cool 
so l finished reading with her 
l finally hold up my finger 
like give me a minute here 
  right 
   choking up  like give me a minute 
more than that   cause l m in it 
but like l m broke 
 sobbing  give me a second here 
may l have a minute 
so l put down my head 
and the whole room sits in silence   
for at least five minutes 
  swear to god  five minutes 
  whoa 
l look up  everyone
rips up in applause 
the whole room is rip roaring clapping
it up for me  for big t  right 
everyone in the room is sitting
there tearing their face 
they re crying their eyes out 
the guy working the camera  you know 
just filming it  got tears in his eyes 
  not the camera guy 
  l swear to god  the camera guy 
not so much from my reading 
although it had a lot to do with it 
but  really  he had
his own things going on 
so the producer
starts to talk to me 
he says   trent  when you
walked in this room 
l didn t see trent walker
come in here  
he said   l saw big brother
come in here   fuckin  great  right 
he says   you walked in with the role 
you nailed it  you re great  
  so give me the fuckin  part 
  exactly  right 
then he says to me    he says 
 trent  l gotta be honest with you 
l think that it might be that
you may be just a little bit old   
for the role of brother  
so l felt confident 
 cause l gave a good read 
l say to him   well  how old exactly
is the role of brother  
   mike  here it comes 
   cause l m tall 
  here it comes 
  but l look young  mike

says this to me with a straight face 
this fucking guy 
 eleven years old  
  and you said  double down  
  double down 
because you know why  because you
make it happen on the bets

you re doing really well

l host an open mike 
l play a fuckin  bus driver in a movie 
big fuckin  deal

that specializes in magicians 
how good am l doin  
did you get turned down
for goofy 
they turned you down 
yeah  they went with somebody who had
some more theme park experience 
l killed for that job 
the point is  mike  it all depends
on how you look at it  all right 
you re telling me that your life sucks 
that means mine is god awful 
part of the reason l moved out here
is l saw how well you were doing 
and l figured if you could
make it  l could too 
  l didn t make it 
  you got an agent 
you got in the unions 
you know  that s your problem 
is that you   
you don t look at
the things that you have 
you only look at the stuff
you don t have 
those guys are right about you 
you re money 
then why won t she call 
she won t call
because you left 
she s got her own life to deal with 
man  and that s in new york 
she s a sweet girl
and l love her to pieces 
but fuck her  man   
you gotta get on with your life 
you gotta let go of the past  and mikey

all that shit 
you re gonna get over it 
how did you get over it 
how long did it take 
l don t know 
sometimes it still hurts 
you know how it is  man 
lt s like   
you wake up every day 
it hurts a little bit less 
then you wake up one day
and it doesn t hurt at all 
and the funny thing is   
this is kinda weird 
but it s like   
you almost miss that pain 
you miss the pain 
yeah  for the same reason
that you miss her 
because you    you lived
with it for so long

l never cared much
for moonlit skies
never winked back
at fireflies
but now that the stars
are in your eyes
l m beginnin 
to see the light
and l never went in
for afterglow
or candlelight
on the mistletoe
but now when you turn
the lamp down low
l m beginnin 
to see the light
l used to ramble
through the park
shadowboxin  in the dark
then you came
and caused the spark
that s a four alarm fire now
l never made love
by lantern shine
l never saw rainbows
in my wine
but now that your lips
are burnin  mine
l m beginnin 
to see the light
l never cared much
for moonlit skies
l never winked back
at fireflies
but now that the stars
are in your eyes
l m beginnin 
to see the light
and l never went in
for afterglow
or candlelight
on the mistletoe
but now when you turn
the lamp down low
l m beginnin 
to see the light
you know  l used to ramble
through the park
shadowboxin  in the dark
then you came
and lit that spark
that s a four alarm fire now
and l never made love
by lantern shine
never saw rainbows
