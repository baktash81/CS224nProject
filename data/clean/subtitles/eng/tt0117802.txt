applause whistling
microphone feedback
applause continues
youre nobody
til somebody loves you
youre nobody
til somebody cares
you may be king
you may possess the world
and its gold
but gold wont bring you
happiness
when youre growin old
the world still is the same
you never change it
as sure as the stars
shine above
youre nobody
til somebody loves you
so find yourself
somebody to love
the world
still is the same
you never change it
as sure as the stars
shine above
but youre nobody
til somebody loves you
so find yourself
somebody to love
so find yourself
somebody to love
okay so what if l dont
want to give up on her
you dont call
you said l dont call if
l wanted to give up on her
right
so l dont call either way
right
so whats the difference
there is no difference right now
see mike the only difference
between giving up and not giving up
is if you take her back
when she wants to come back
but you cant do anything
to make her want to come back
ln fact you can only do stuff
to make her not want to come back
so the only difference is
if l forget about her or just
pretend to forget about her
right
well that sucks
yeah it sucks
so its like a retroactive
decision then l mean l
could like forget about her
and then when she comes back make like
l just pretended to forget about her
right although probably
more likely the opposite
what do you mean
l mean at first youre gonna pretend
to forget about her
not call her
l dont know whatever
but then eventually
you really will forget about her
well unless she comes back first
mm see thats the thing
somehow they know not to come back
until you really forget
theres the rub
theres the rub
look man uh llm sorry we always
talk about the same thing all the time
ah no its all right
lts just that you know
lts just you been there man

l never cared much
for moonlit skies
never winked back
at fireflies
but now that the stars
are in your eyes
lm beginnin
to see the light
and l never went in
for afterglow
or candlelight
on the mistletoe
but now when you turn
the lamp down low
lm beginnin
to see the light
l used to ramble
through the park
shadowboxin in the dark
then you came
and caused the spark
thats a fouralarm fire now
l never made love
by lantern shine
l never saw rainbows
in my wine
but now that your lips
are burnin mine
lm beginnin
to see the light
l never cared much
for moonlit skies
l never winked back
at fireflies
but now that the stars
are in your eyes
lm beginnin
to see the light
and l never went in
for afterglow
or candlelight
on the mistletoe
but now when you turn
the lamp down low
lm beginnin
to see the light
you know l used to ramble
through the park
shadowboxin in the dark
then you came
and lit that spark
thats a fouralarm fire now
and l never made love
by lantern shine
never saw rainbows
