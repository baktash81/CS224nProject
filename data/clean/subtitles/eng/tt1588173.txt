i should get out more 
i should eat better 
my posture is terrible 
i should stand up straight 
people would respect me e
if i stood up straighter 
what s wrong with me 
i just want to connect 
why can t i connect
with people 
oh  right 
it s because i m dead 
i shouldn t be
so hard on myself 
i mean  we re all dead 
this girl is dead 
that guy s dead 
that guy in the corner
is definitely dead 
jesus  these guys look awful 
 zombies moaning 
i wish i could
introduce myself 
but i don t remember
my name anymore 
i mean  i think
it started with an  r  
but that s all i have left 
i can t remember my name 
or my parents  or my job 
although my hoodie would
suggest i was unemployed 
 scanner beeps 
sometimes i look
at the others
and try to imagine
what they were 
you were a janitor 
you were the rich son
of a corporate ceo 
you were
a personal trainer 
 screaming 
 ball bouncing 
and now you re a corpse 
i have a hard time
piecing together
how this whole
apocalypse thing happened 
could have been
chemical warfare
or an airborne virus 
or a radioactive
outbreak monkey 
but it doesn t really matt 
this is what we are now 
this is a typical day
for me 
i shuffle around 
occasionally
bumping into people 
unable to apologize
or say much of anything 
it must have been
so much better before 
when everyone could
express themselves 
and communicate
their feelings
and just enjoy
each other s company 
a lot of us have
made our home here
at this airport 
i don t know why 
people wait at airports 
i guess 
but i m not sure
what we re all waiting for 
 boneys growling 
oh  man  they call
these guys boneys 
they don t bother us muc 
but they ll eat anything
with a heartbeat 
i mean  i will too 
but at least
i m conflicted about it 
we all become them some da 
at some point
you just give up  i guess 
you lose all hope 
after that  there s
no turning back 
oh  man  gross   
stop  stop 
don t pick at it 
you re making it worse 
oh  this is what
i have to look forward to 
it s kind of a bummer 
i don t want to be this wa 
i m lonely  i m lost 
i mean  i m literally lost 
i ve never been in this t
of the airport before 
wonder if these guys
are lost  too 
wandering around 
but never getting anywhere 
do they feel trapped 
do they want more than t 
am i the only one 
 song playing 
r   this is my best friend 
 m groaning 
by best friend 
i mean we occasionally get
and stare awkwardly
at each other 
 both grunt 
we even have
almost conversations
sometimes 
 both grunting rhythmically 
days pass this way 
but sometimes we even find
actual words  words like 
hungry 
and   
city 
uh 
even though
we can t communicate 
we do share
a similar taste in food 
travelling in packs
just kind of makes sense 
especially when everyone
and their grandmother
is trying to shoot you
in the head all the time 
god  we move slow 
 sighs 
this could take a while 
 indistinct talking 
hello  and thank you
for your service today 
in the eight years since its
plague destroyed our world 
you think we re getting
this stuff for the cure 
   since we erected
this wall   
no one believes in a cure
anymore  jules 
   we have counted on
young volunteers like you
to gather resources
from beyond the wa 
but first 
a word of caution 
corpses look human 
they are not 
they do not think 
they do not bleed 
whether they were your motr
or your best friend 
they are beyond your hel 
they are uncaring  unfeeling 
incapable of remorse 
sound like anyone
you know  dad 
just picture them as this 
 growling 
as sons and daughters of
possibly the sole reaming
human settlement on earth 
you are a critical pt
of what stands betweens
and extinction 
therefore
you have an obligation
to return to us safely 
and if you remember
your training  you will 
good luck  godspeed 
and god bless america 
usa  usa

 groans

maybe i could have
thought this through
a little more 
but i can tell
when a girl
needs her space 
there s a lot of ways
to get to know a person 
eating her dead
boyfriend s brains
is one of the more
unorthodox methods  but

working in agriculture 
but tell me you would
never consider
going to work construction
with your father 
you know  on the wall
we need good people 
um   
don t mind him  per 
dad s idea of saving
humanity
is to build a really
big concrete box 
put everyone in it 
and then wait at the door
with guns
until we grow
old and die 
well  julie  without the wall 
we would be eating brains now
instead of rice 
dad   
julie   this is
the only way
past the wall 
otherwise we get stopped

i like that 
i think someday
someone s going to
figure out
this whole thing and
exhume the whole world 
exhume 
and what does that mean

to  like  revive 
it means to dig up 
as in digging up a corpse

it s hopeless 
this is what i get
for wanting more 
i should just be happy

it s easier not to feel 
then i wouldn t have to
feel like this 
  i ve been alone
too many nights

does it hurt 
yeah 
yeah 
sir 
this is colonel grigio 
the situation has changed 
let s get you two
the hell out of here 
are you still bleeding 
yes 
good 
sorry 
r   on the one hand 
getting shot
in the chest hurt 
like  a lot 
but on the other 
it felt good to bleed 
to feel pain 
to feel love 
i wish i could say
we cured the boneys
with love 
but really we just
straight up killed them  
it sounds
kind of messed up 
but no one felt
too bad about it 
they were too far gone
to change 
it was actually
a really good
bonding experience
for us and the humans 
once we joined forces 
they didn t stand a chance 
the ones we didn t kill
just wasted away 
and the rest of us 
well  we kind of learned
how to live again 
for a while 
it seemed like
a lot of us forgot
what that meant 
the humans
began to accept us 
connect with us 
teach us 
this was the key
to the cure 
it was scary at first  bt
every great thing starts 
a little scary  doesn t  
this is how it happened 
this is how the world was
exhumed 
you need some help 
yeah

zombie fingers

you don t want to know
what it was 
you don t want
your old life back
