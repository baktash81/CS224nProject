i should get out more
i should eat better
my posture is terrible
i should stand up straight
people would respect me e
if i stood up straighter
whats wrong with me
i just want to connect
why cant i connect
with people
oh right
its because im dead
i shouldnt be
so hard on myself
i mean were all dead
this girl is dead
that guys dead
that guy in the corner
is definitely dead
jesus these guys look awful
zombies moaning
i wish i could
introduce myself
but i dont remember
my name anymore
i mean i think
it started with an r
but thats all i have left
i cant remember my name
or my parents or my job
although my hoodie would
suggest i was unemployed
scanner beeps
sometimes i look
at the others
and try to imagine
what they were
you were a janitor
you were the rich son
of a corporate ceo
you were
a personal trainer
screaming
ball bouncing
and now youre a corpse
i have a hard time
piecing together
how this whole
apocalypse thing happened
could have been
chemical warfare
or an airborne virus
or a radioactive
outbreak monkey
but it doesnt really matt
this is what we are now
this is a typical day
for me
i shuffle around
occasionally
bumping into people
unable to apologize
or say much of anything
it must have been
so much better before
when everyone could
express themselves
and communicate
their feelings
and just enjoy
each others company
a lot of us have
made our home here
at this airport
i dont know why
people wait at airports
i guess
but im not sure
what were all waiting for
boneys growling
oh man they call
these guys boneys
they dont bother us muc
but theyll eat anything
with a heartbeat
i mean i will too
but at least
im conflicted about it
we all become them some da
at some point
you just give up i guess
you lose all hope
after that theres
no turning back
oh man gross
stop stop
dont pick at it
youre making it worse
oh this is what
i have to look forward to
its kind of a bummer
i dont want to be this wa
im lonely im lost
i mean im literally lost
ive never been in this t
of the airport before
wonder if these guys
are lost too
wandering around
but never getting anywhere
do they feel trapped
do they want more than t
am i the only one
song playing
r  this is my best friend
m groaning
by best friend
i mean we occasionally get
and stare awkwardly
at each other
both grunt
we even have
almostconversations
sometimes
both grunting rhythmically
days pass this way
but sometimes we even find
actual words words like
hungry
and
city
uh
even though
we cant communicate
we do share
a similar taste in food
travelling in packs
just kind of makes sense
especially when everyone
and their grandmother
is trying to shoot you
in the head all the time
god we move slow
sighs
this could take a while
indistinct talking
hello and thank you
for your service today
in the eight years since its
plague destroyed our world
you think were getting
this stuff for the cure
since we erected
this wall
no one believes in a cure
anymore jules
we have counted on
young volunteers like you
to gather resources
from beyond the wa
but first
a word of caution
corpses look human
they are not
they do not think
they do not bleed
whether they were your motr
or your best friend
they are beyond your hel
they are uncaring unfeeling
incapable of remorse
sound like anyone
you know dad
just picture them as this
growling
as sons and daughters of
possibly the sole reaming
human settlement on earth
you are a critical pt
of what stands betweens
and extinction
therefore
you have an obligation
to return to us safely
and if you remember
your training you will
good luck godspeed
and god bless america
usa usa
perry lets go

unorthodox methods but

julie tells me youve been
working in agriculture
but tell me you would
never consider
going to work construction
with your father
you know on the wall
we need good people
um
dont mind him per
dads idea of saving
humanity
is to build a really
big concrete box
put everyone in it
and then wait at the door
with guns
until we grow
old and die
well julie without the wall
we would be eating brains now
instead of rice
dad
julie  this is

the situation has changed
lets get you two
the hell out of here
are you still bleeding
yes
good
sorry
r  on the one hand
getting shot
in the chest hurt
like a lot
but on the other
it felt good to bleed
to feel pain
to feel love
i wish i could say
we cured the boneys
with love
but really we just
straight up killed them
it sounds
kind of messed up
but no one felt
too bad about it
they were too far gone
to change
it was actually
a really good
bonding experience
for us and the humans
once we joined forces
they didnt stand a chance
the ones we didnt kill
just wasted away
and the rest of us
well we kind of learned
how to live again
for a while
it seemed like
a lot of us forgot
what that meant
the humans
began to accept us
connect with us
teach us
this was the key
to the cure
it was scary at first bt
every great thing starts
a little scary doesnt
this is how it happened
this is how the world was
exhumed
you need some help
yeah
i have uh
zombie fingers
