 exploring  is
a better word 
yeah  well  so  you know 
what if they are  exploring  
this is the age for that 
we should be
good with that 
we should  we should 
i just don t understand
why he s exploring with that loser 
we don t really know what s going on 
we shouldn t jump to conclusions 
i feel like he has so much potential 
he s just wasting it 
 scoffing 
what are you
trying to say 
what do you mean 
what am i trying to say 
i just  you know 
i feel like there s some subtext here 
what are you
talking about 
you know 
 like mother  like son  
both of us wandering in the dark 
aimless   wasting our potential   
honey  you re on
a whole other tangent 
i have no idea
what you re talking about 
well  you know  maybe it hasn t risen to
the plane of consciousness for you yet 
yeah  maybe 
someone took my knife 
so what were they like 
they were
really sweet kids 
the boy was this little  you know 
kind of sensitive jock type kid 
and the girl was
really innocent
but just whip smart
and super  super cute 
sounds like you really liked them 
like you guys connected 
yeah  yeah

oh  dude 
god  disgusting 
come on  let s go 
it s alive  dude 
put it back 
fine  fine  fine 
sweet 
dude  we re watching this 
you think the whole
thing s like this 
laser  maybe   
maybe we should
fast forward 
laser  you left your bike
in the driveway again 
nic  laser  your mom and i accept and
love you unconditionally 
you know that  right 
yeah 
yeah  and you know that you can be
open with us about anything 
yeah  i know 
okay 
laser  do you want to talk to us
about anything 
like what 
j ust anything 
you know  anything
on your mind 
well  there is something 
but it s more of a question  though 
that s okay 
we won t judge you 
why do you guys
watch gay man porn 
well  first i have to say
that we rarely watch that movie 
honey 
and  second 
i really don t appreciate
you snooping around
our room  okay 
was that clay s idea 
no  mom 
wait a minute 
i have to say  again  i don t like him 
i know  i know 
okay  he seems unstable 
honey  honey 
that s not what he asked 
do you want to answer
his question 
yeah  okay 
well  sweetie  you know 
human sexuality is complicated 
and sometimes desire can be 
you know  counterintuitive 
you know  for example 
because women s
sexual responsiveness is internalized 
sometimes it s exciting for us to
see responsiveness externalized 
like with a   
like with a penis 
wouldn t you guys just rather
watch girls doing it  though 
well  you would think that 
but usually in these movies 
they hire two straight women to pretend 
and the inauthenticity
is just unbearable 
whoa  that s enough 
laser  your mom
and i sense
that there s some
other stuff going on in your life 
we just want
to be let in 
what do you mean 
are you having a relationship
with someone 
you can tell us  honey 
we would understand and support you 
look  i only met him once 
what do you mean once 
did he find you online 
nic  wait 
what 
wait  wait  who did you meet once 
paul  i met him with joni 
jules  paul  who s paul 
why was joni there 
she set it up 
wait  forget the set up 
who s paul 
our sperm donor 
did you guys think
i was gay 
no 
no way 
jules  of course not 
yeah  i mean  we understand
that you d be curious
about your biological father 
i mean 
it s completely natural 
but why didn t you tell us 
because we knew
you d be upset 
we re not upset 
no  no  no 
we re not  we wish that
you d included us in the conversation 
that s all 
you know  but   
but you met him  and that s cool 
and now 
we can move on 
actually 
i want to see him again 
you do 
yeah  i was
gonna tell you 
well  no  okay 
no way 
no one s seeing anyone
until we meet him 
i get it  okay  he s their biological
father and all that crap 
but it still feels
really shitty 
like we re not enough
or something  you know 
of course i know 
you know  i don t   
i don t want to time share
our kids with anybody 
especially when it s joni s last summer

always know that   
yes 
   that you wanted to be
in the food services industry

but then i dropped out of school 
you dropped
out of college 
yeah  it just
wasn t my thing 
no  why s that 
paul  i don t know 
it just seemed like a massive waste
of money after a while  you know 
i was just sitting
on my ass listening to people spout ideas 
i could just as easily
have learned in a book 
oh 
okay 
i m not saying that 
you know 
i think that higher learning
uniformly blows 
you know  i think
college is great for some people 
joni  i m sure
you re gonna love it 
but just    i m a doer 
that s how i learn 
it s just me 
i m weird that way  i guess  thank you 
which is probably why
i m in the food services industry 
 all laughing

let me tell you something 
man  this is not your family 
this is my family 
i know that  nic 
no  you don t know 
you don t know 
and you know why 
because you re
a fucking interloper 
if you want a family so much 
you go out and make your own 
 chatter on tv 
i need to say something 
it s no big secret
your mom and i are in hell right now  and   
bottom line is 
marriage is hard 
it s really fucking hard 
just two people
slogging through the shit 
year after year  getting older  changing 
it s a fucking
marathon  okay 
so  sometimes  you know 
you re together so long  that you just   
you stop seeing
the other person 
you just see
weird projections of your own junk 
instead of talking
to each other  you go off the rails
and act grubby and make stupid choices 
which is what i did 
and i feel sick about it because i love you
guys  and i love your mom 
and that s the truth 
sometimes you hurt the ones you love
the most  i don t know why 
you know  if i read more
russian novels  then   
 sniffling 
anyway   
 clearing throat 
i just wanted to say
how sorry i am for what i did 
i hope you ll
forgive me eventually

i thought it would be
