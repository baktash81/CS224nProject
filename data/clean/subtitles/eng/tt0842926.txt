open with us about anything
yeah i know
okay
laser do you want to talk to us
about anything
like what
j ust anything
you know anything
on your mind
well there is something
but its more of a question though
thats okay
we wont judge you
why do you guys
watch gay man porn
well first i have to say
that we rarely watch that movie
honey
and second
i really dont appreciate
you snooping around
our room okay
was that clays idea
no mom
wait a minute
i have to say again i dont like him
i know i know
okay he seems unstable
honey honey
thats not what he asked
do you want to answer
his question
yeah okay
well sweetie you know
human sexuality is complicated
and sometimes desire can be
you know counterintuitive
you know for example
because womens
sexual responsiveness is internalized
sometimes its exciting for us to
see responsiveness externalized
like with a
like with a penis
wouldnt you guys just rather
watch girls doing it though
well you would think that
but usually in these movies
they hire two straight women to pretend
and the inauthenticity
is just unbearable
whoa thats enough
laser your mom
and i sense
that theres some
other stuff going on in your life
we just want
to be let in
what do you mean
are you having a relationship
with someone
you can tell us honey
we would understand and support you
look i only met him once
what do you mean once
did he find you online
nic wait
what
wait wait who did you meet once
paul i met him with joni
jules paul whos paul
why was joni there
she set it up
wait forget the setup
whos paul
our sperm donor
did you guys think
i was gay
no
no way
jules of course not
yeah i mean we understand
that youd be curious
about your biological father
i mean
its completely natural
but why didnt you tell us
because we knew
youd be upset
were not upset
no no no
were not we wish that
youd included us in the conversation
thats all
you know but
but you met him and thats cool
and now
we can move on
actually
i want to see him again
you do
yeah i was
gonna tell you
well no okay
no way
no ones seeing anyone
until we meet him
i get it okay hes their biological
father and all that crap
but it still feels
really shitty
like were not enough
or something you know
of course i know
you know i dont
i dont want to timeshare
our kids with anybody
especially when its jonis last summer
at home
no way
jesus jules
the plumber was just here

that was a long time ago

you dropped
out of college

wasnt my thing

paul i dont know
it just seemed like a massive waste
of money after a while you know
i was just sitting
on my ass listening to people spout ideas
i could just as easily
have learned in a book
oh
okay
im not saying that
you know
i think that higher learning
uniformly blows
you know i think
college is great for some people
joni im sure
youre gonna love it

businesses arent easy
yeah
but im in the process
of starting a new business
great good for you
whats that
landscape design

this is my family
i know that nic
no you dont know

a fucking interloper
if you want a family so much
you go out and make your own
chatter on tv
i need to say something
its no big secret
your mom and i are in hell right now and
bottom line is
marriage is hard
its really fucking hard
just two people
slogging through the shit
year after year getting older changing
its a fucking
marathon okay
so sometimes you know
youre together so long that you just
you stop seeing
the other person
you just see
weird projections of your own junk
instead of talking
to each other you go off the rails
and act grubby and make stupid choices
which is what i did
and i feel sick about it because i love you
guys and i love your mom
and thats the truth
sometimes you hurt the ones you love
the most i dont know why
you know if i read more
russian novels then
sniffling
anyway
clearing throat
i just wanted to say
how sorry i am for what i did
i hope youll
forgive me eventually
