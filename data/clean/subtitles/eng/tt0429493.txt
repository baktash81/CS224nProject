 container explodes 
after conferring  we ve decided to demote
you to the rank of first lieutenant
lieutenant sosa  it s nothing personal
but you lost those plates
those were your responsibility
 consider yourself lucky  others are going to
prison over this    good day director macready
 lieutenant  you re dismissed
colonel smith  this court has been unable to
recover any direct order from general morrison
for you to conduct the mission
for which you re being tried
your honour this was a covert operation
and no official orders were given
so the one individual who could verify the legitimacy
of this operation is deceased  is that correct colonel 
no your honour
not deceased
general morrison was murdered
 colonel  i ve been on a long time
seen units like yours
they re outlaws
units like that pose a direct threat
to the fabric and fundamentals of our military
your honour  why hasn t
black forest been brought to trial 
black forrest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction
where s the plan boss 
where s the escape package 
this mission isn t over lieutenant
i ll clear your names
we find pike and the plates
no matter what
your honours  these men were
acting under my command
any judgement should be levied
against me and me alone
absolutely not sir  we were all
participating in this operation willingly
i don t want to be tried separately
i refuse to be tried separately sir
in accordance with the uniform
code of military justice
this court is rendering guilty verdicts
for each member of this alpha unit
or  a team 
and mandating incarceration in
separate maximum security facilities
for a period of up to ten years
you are all hereby stripped of formal rank
and dishonourably discharged
this is bullshit man
 this session is adjourned
at black forest what    
  you disgraced me
absolute disgrace 
 are you happy 
colonel  control your men 
 get your hands off me 
well hello mr lynch
long time
you look very relaxed lynch
a lot of cameras in here
yeah there are  yeah well they seem to be
having some technical issues at the moment
i may not show up until playback
hannibal  can i call you hannibal 
can t call you colonel any more
six months
been waiting for you
bust out of here and round up the rest of the
backstreet boys and lead me to those plates
six months and not a peep
everybody thought you and your
team were working with pike
everybody except you
pike murdered morrrison
set me and my boys up
and stole those plates
and i know where he is
nobody knows where he is
there s a single image of him taken
about a month ago somewhere in europe
we think it s a grab from the cctv camera
frankfurt  germany
 snickering  how did you get that in here 
 time  lynch
give me a minute  i m good
if i ve got an hour  i m great
you give me six months
i m unbeatable
i know pike  who s the arab 
we don t know
we think he s the  deep dark  
hidden hand in this whole thing
maybe a broker  maybe a buyer
lynch  we have common enemies
and you have limited choices
my team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back
i wouldn t be so sure 
 then why did you make the long drive out here 
you and your boys at langley
want your own private printing press
that s about as deep
as your patriotism goes
so what would you need from me 
i swore to my team that
i would clear our names
you of all people must
understand the value of a name
listen  i want full reinstatement and
clean records for myself  and my team
i can t get you out here
not legally at least
this is something the boys
in langley do very very well

now what you re wathching is a signal jammer
this is high tech stuff
it sends a jamming signal in front of every
camera every time we might get a glimpse of him

nobody lnows who he is
which begs a bigger question

 the same guy who put us on in baghdad
lynch  cia

smith and his team were engaged
in a c130 over mannheim  germany
by two reaper drones
i m not sure if it s an encryption glitch
but it says that they
were shot down in a tank
norad s calling it an exhale
but there s an afflicting report
i m sure there is
we got a german housebrau
who says she saw a tank
driving up and out of lake volgelstein
with a guy resembeling murdock
excuse me  which way to berlin 
  asking for directions to berlin
that s impossible
  well this will be the second time
smith has died this week
is that possible 
what have you got for me 
we just got the unscrambled
composite of smith s visitor in prison
but with no id
on the subject yet
hello handsome
wait  i ve seen this person before
i know this guy
baghdad
get me a clean patch to langley
we re going fishing
i heard bits and pieces but   
  sir 
i have   
 i was talking
can you stop 
i have a d o d hardline from lieutenant sosa
she s looking for agent lynch
yeah  he s not available   ever
agent lynch  from baghdad 
general morrison s tent 
out
why do we have her 
she s got a fantastic
personality  that s why
with whom am i speaking 
this is capt    uh lieutenant sosa
is this agent lynch 
sorry  i don t have a first name
  neither do i
so what can i do you for lieutenant 
i m looking at an image of you from
the diciplinary barracks of fort carson
she s hot
did you visit former colonel
hannibal smith in prison 
i don t know what you re
talking about former captain
agent lynch  if you facilitated
smith s escape and are
currently aiding and abetting him
oooh buddy   
if you could make
something like that stick
your next promotion
should be in the five star range
and if you re helping
to retrieve those engraving plates
i m going to have to go out
of my way to dissapoint you
i want her phones  her computers 
any support packages she operates
i want to know everything  i want
active intercept ops on everything she s got
i want every move monitored
from this moment forward
you realize she s d o d 
  i don t care if she s g o d  do it
boss  check this out
we ve tracked this photograph of pike
to the konigsbank in frankfurt 
our surveillance has him and
an unknown arab making regular
trips from the train
station to the bank
all over the last month
  pikes getting sloppy
yeah but if we re on to him what are
the odds that smith and his team
are on to pike and the arab too 
this is a direct pulldown
from the pentagon s database
there s absolutely no way smith
and his team could have this stuff
i think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times
pike has been moving the stolen
engraving plates to the
konigsbank tower in frankfurt
over the past month
tomorrow the last of the cases
containing these plates will be
transferred to the arab
this will mark the only time
in the last six months
that all the plates have
been in one location
it s our best and only shot
at getting them back
they leave the konigsbank tower
for the 7 15 train to zurich
gentlemen  we re going to make
sure they miss that train
face
  yeah
time to bring in
your former flame
if she s as good as i think then
she ll be on her way to frankfurt
to intercept those plates
why would you tip her off 
she s a crusader and we re going
to need her at some point
keep your eyes and ears open boys
 sosa s named called over pa 
now the wrinkle
if sosa s on to us
we can assume
that lynch is on to her
and if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates
he won t hesitate to kill her
face  get to the train station
this is sosa
 static 
if there s a threat from lynch
deal with it
hello 
shooter s green  say again   
shooter s green
hello 
 disconnect signal 
something s wrong
we re marked guys  pull back
i don t like this at all
see  don t be seen
 phone rings 
hello beautiful       you ve got some
balls you put a drop phone on me

please  somehow i doubt that
  hey  what are you so pissed about 
we got the plates  you wanted

how could you not 
hannibal 
do you know who this is 
we all do
morrison 
  oh  hell no
jesus christ
not so sure that it is a blessing
but  good hunting my friend
thank you
  you son of a bitch
morrison  holy shit
outside  all of you
outside now 
i knew if lynch helped me
escape  you had to be part of it
you and pike were making a play on those
plates with lynch  and you turned on him
the way you turned of us
  lynch was never going to cut us in
he was going to use us
he brought you on as insurance
you never thought you d
betrayed your oldest living friend 
i just hit first hannibal
i m a fighting man
you re a liar
and a traitor
you knew morrison was masquerading
as the arab  why not share that 
i wasn t one hundred percent sure
  how about ninety nine percent 
would you think it was
worth mentioning then 
lynch  what did you think 
did you think i would just kill him on the spot 
well i was certain of it
i still am
do you have the plates 
  i wouldn t be calling you if i didn t
smith  return the plates  kill
morrison and reclaim your lives
i want signed and authorized
amnesty agreements for myself

department and the joint chiefs of staff
you hear me

you owe me that much
  you owe me 
you re going to tell them we re innocent
 whispering  you owe me
hannibal  it s meaningless
what are you fighting for now 
you and those boys
your rank  your reputation
they re shit 
you re convicts  plates or no plates
you re federal fugitives
and when they re done with you
hannibal  they ll just burn you
zulu 1 zulu 1 this is broadsword

broadsword  did you come
up with that  that s awesome
boss could you do that

loyalty doesn t fit in the overhead bins
i thought you and smith
were working together
you thought wrong
yes we have weapons
no  you may not wand us
you want a deal 
i ll make you a deal
how about i dedicate
my immediate future
to destroying yours 
  how about you get smart
and start dealing
before somebody else does
former captain

that looks exactly like this one 
then this troubled young
loner belongs to me
let s go
how the hell did
thay get an extradition order 
sorry pike  at least
with me there are rules
the cia s got rules  our
rules are just cooler than yours

this room with you inside
i d be doing the
world a big favor
that s not nice
answer me
  stay close to the fires boys
if that gun ship is still around
it won t read our body heat
idiot lynch  was so quick to kill us
didn t bother locating the plates
where do we stand in
non violence now ba 
are you pissed

who gives a shit about the plates 
morrison was the only way to clear us
and without morrison  we got nothing
what do we do boss 
  i don t know murdock

this guy lynch  i think
i ve got him figured out
you got a plan kid 
  how do we get out of here 
give me twenty minutes
so morrison s dead
smith and his team are dead
another fifteen minutes or so
we ll locate those engraving plates
this is you gloating 
  no this is me beating you
after you burned me 
we had a deal  remember 
not you and me

not you and me directly
  and you two collude and cut me out 
hey  what are you doing

what are you doing 
it s a suppressor
counter clockwise
you re holding a gun like that 
you ve held a gun like that before
and you re still here 
that s amazing
jesus  hey  final request
don t let this guy shoot me please
so if sosa knows we re alive
 she ll think morrison s alive too
let s just hope that lynch
still has sosa s comm line
this is sosa
  general morrison is in my posession
what  i m sorry i can t hear you
who is this 
okay this was not well thought out
  no shit 
i mean i gotta teach you how to kill me
hey  do me a favor all right 
put the barrel  put the gun flush to my head
  are you sure 
there you go  right there
  is that going to go right through 
we re okay
never cuff a man ia a seated position
with his hands behind his back
makes it impossibe
to see the hands
that was cool
  you liked that 
oh i liked that  i liked that a lot
are you all right  you idiot 
yeah it was a good hit
  please handcuff him
we don t need to use them again
we don t need the cuffs
who are you talking to

before you lock this signal
so listen  we can
prove our innocence
okay now go back to   did you say you
have morrison  you have general morrisson
correct
  you have him alive 
and well
that s why lynch is trying
to wipe us out wholesale
too much to explain now 
but morrison s testimony frees us
and fries lynch
uh oh
well not without the plates
  also in my possesion
remember  lynch thinks we re dead
and i want to keep it that way
  give me a pen
you still use a pen 
la docks  48 hours  dawn

in return  i want a re trial
in front of a civilian court
all right we ll deal  la docks

lynch s paradox  
murdock  are you done with that 
this a guy who needs anonymity
but he love the attricountaby
he s an administrator
he s not an operator
where is it 
very nice  so he stays as far away
from the point of impact as possible
and never gets his hands
dirty if he can help it
but we re going to change all of that
you can t hustle a hustler fool
no sparks  no flames not even
a flashlight near this stuff
this guy s never at

victory attained by violence
is tantamount to defeat
for it is momentary
ghandi 
it is better to be violent
if there is violence in our hearts
than to put on the cloak
of non violence to cover impotence

  same guy
ghandi wasn t afraid to
fight for the things he believed in
what is it you 
believe in ba

charge you all with escaping lawful custody
what   hannibal what

still illegal to break out of jail
director  smithand his men were 
instrumental in recovering the plates
they re still level ten fugitives

and we re going back to prison
we returned the plates  we can hold
our heads high  we did the right thing
yeah after what they did to us
this is bullshit
they burned us again hannibal  we
trusted the system and it turned on us
remember boys  no matter how random
things might appear  there is still a plan
kid   
well  i don t mean to steal
your line boss  but uh   
i love it when a plan comes together
they survived as soldiers of fortune
