container explodes
after conferring weve decided to demote
you to the rank of first lieutenant
lieutenant sosa its nothing personal
but you lost those plates
those were your responsibility
consider yourself lucky others are going to
prison over this  good day director macready
lieutenant youre dismissed
colonel smith this court has been unable to
recover any direct order from general morrison
for you to conduct the mission
for which youre being tried
your honour this was a covert operation
and no official orders were given
so the one individual who could verify the legitimacy
of this operation is deceased is that correct colonel
no your honour
not deceased
general morrison was murdered
colonel ive been on a long time
seen units like yours
theyre outlaws
units like that pose a direct threat
to the fabric and fundamentals of our military
your honour why hasnt
black forest been brought to trial
black forrest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction
wheres the plan boss
wheres the escape package
this mission isnt over lieutenant
ill clear your names
we find pike and the plates
no matter what
your honours these men were
acting under my command
any judgement should be levied
against me and me alone
absolutely not sir we were all
participating in this operation willingly
i dont want to be tried separately
i refuse to be tried separately sir
in accordance with the uniform
code of military justice
this court is rendering guilty verdicts
for each member of this alpha unit
or ateam
and mandating incarceration in
separate maximum security facilities
for a period of up to ten years
you are all hereby stripped of formal rank
and dishonourably discharged
this is bullshit man
this session is adjourned
at black forest what
you disgraced me
absolute disgrace
are you happy
colonel control your men
get your hands off me
well hello mr lynch
long time
you look very relaxed lynch
a lot of cameras in here
yeah there are yeah well they seem to be
having some technical issues at the moment
i may not show up until playback
hannibal can i call you hannibal
cant call you colonel any more
six months
been waiting for you
bust out of here and round up the rest of the
backstreet boys and lead me to those plates
six months and not a peep
everybody thought you and your
team were working with pike
everybody except you
pike murdered morrrison
set me and my boys up
and stole those plates
and i know where he is
nobody knows where he is
theres a single image of him taken
about a month ago somewhere in europe
we think its a grab from the cctv camera
frankfurt germany
snickering how did you get that in here
time lynch
give me a minute im good
if ive got an hour im great
you give me six months
im unbeatable
i know pike whos the arab
we dont know
we think hes the deep dark
hidden hand in this whole thing
maybe a broker maybe a buyer
lynch we have common enemies
and you have limited choices
my team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back
i wouldnt be so sure
then why did you make the long drive out here
you and your boys at langley
want your own private printing press
thats about as deep
as your patriotism goes
so what would you need from me
i swore to my team that
i would clear our names
you of all people must
understand the value of a name
listen i want full reinstatement and
clean records for myself and my team
i cant get you out here
not legally at least
this is something the boys
in langley do very very well

by two reaper drones
im not sure if its an encryption glitch

were shot down in a tank
norads calling it an exhale
but theres an afflicting report
im sure there is
we got a german housebrau
who says she saw a tank
driving up and out of lake volgelstein
with a guy resembeling murdock
excuse me which way to berlin
asking for directions to berlin
thats impossible
well this will be the second time
smith has died this week
is that possible
what have you got for me
we just got the unscrambled
composite of smiths visitor in prison
but with no id
on the subject yet
hello handsome
wait ive seen this person before
i know this guy
baghdad
get me a clean patch to langley
were going fishing
i heard bits and pieces but
sir
i have
i was talking
can you stop
i have a dod hardline from lieutenant sosa
shes looking for agent lynch
yeah hes not availableever
agent lynch from baghdad
general morrisons tent
out
why do we have her
shes got a fantastic
personality thats why
with whom am i speaking
this is capt uh lieutenant sosa
is this agent lynch
sorry i dont have a first name
neither do i
so what can i do you for lieutenant
im looking at an image of you from
the diciplinary barracks of fort carson
shes hot
did you visit former colonel
hannibal smith in prison
i dont know what youre
talking about former captain
agent lynch if you facilitated
smiths escape and are
currently aiding and abetting him
oooh buddy
if you could make
something like that stick
your next promotion
should be in the five star range
and if youre helping
to retrieve those engraving plates
im going to have to go out
of my way to dissapoint you
i want her phones her computers
any support packages she operates
i want to know everything i want
active intercept ops on everything shes got
i want every move monitored
from this moment forward
you realize shes dod
i dont care if shes god do it
boss check this out
weve tracked this photograph of pike
to the konigsbank in frankfurt
our surveillance has him and
an unknown arab making regular
trips from the train
station to the bank
all over the last month
pikes getting sloppy
yeah but if were on to him what are
the odds that smith and his team
are on to pike and the arab too
this is a direct pulldown
from the pentagons database
theres absolutely no way smith
and his team could have this stuff
i think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times
pike has been moving the stolen
engraving plates to the
konigsbank tower in frankfurt
over the past month
tomorrow the last of the cases
containing these plates will be
transferred to the arab
this will mark the only time
in the last six months
that all the plates have
been in one location
its our best and only shot
at getting them back
they leave the konigsbank tower
for the 715 train to zurich
gentlemen were going to make
sure they miss that train
face
yeah
time to bring in
your former flame
if shes as good as i think then
shell be on her way to frankfurt
to intercept those plates
why would you tip her off
shes a crusader and were going
to need her at some point
keep your eyes and ears open boys
sosas named called over pa
now the wrinkle
if sosas on to us
we can assume
that lynch is on to her
and if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates
he wont hesitate to kill her
face get to the train station
this is sosa
static
if theres a threat from lynch
deal with it
hello
shooters green say again
shooters green
hello
disconnect signal
somethings wrong
were marked guys pull back
i dont like this at all

i knew if lynch helped me
escape you had to be part of it
you and pike were making a play on those
plates with lynch and you turned on him
the way you turned of us
lynch was never going to cut us in
he was going to use us
he brought you on as insurance
you never thought youd
betrayed your oldest living friend
i just hit first hannibal
im a fighting man
youre a liar
and a traitor
you knew morrison was masquerading
as the arab why not share that
i wasnt one hundred percent sure
how about ninety nine percent
would you think it was
worth mentioning then
lynch what did you think
did you think i would just kill him on the spot
well i was certain of it
i still am
do you have the plates
i wouldnt be calling you if i didnt
smith return the plates kill
morrison and reclaim your lives
i want signed and authorized
amnesty agreements for myself

director smithand his men were
instrumental in recovering the plates
theyre still level ten fugitives

trusted the system and it turned on us
remember boys no matter how random
things might appear there is still a plan
kid

your line boss but uh
i love it when a plan comes together
they survived as soldiers of fortune
if you have a problem
if no one else can help
