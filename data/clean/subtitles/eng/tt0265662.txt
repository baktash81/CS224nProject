a story of the town s
beginnings 
it s the story
of the santa rita number one 
birthplace
of west texas oil 
now  as with
most texas legends 
there was a man who thought oil
was right beneath his feet 
and as with
most such stories 
no one else believed him 
except in this case
for two nuns 
who in 1923 met the man
and believed so much in him
and his dream
that they invested money
no one knew they had 
now  when the nuns told
their parish priest
about the man s dream
and their investment in it 
now  he counseled them
to try and get their money back 
sheepishly  they admitted
that it was too late 
that the money
was already spent 
well  the priest  he sighed 
shook his head 
and offered just
one small bit of advice   
bless the site
with rose petals 
and invoke the help
of saint rita 
patron saint
of impossible dreams 
and while the workers
waited for the oil
that would eventually come 
they played baseball 
oil worker 
he s outta here 
played baseball so well
that some were able to give up
the dirt and the despair
and went on to play
major league ball
in the glory days
of ruth and gehrig 
  lndistinct talking  
come on 
i ve heard and told
that story on many occasions 
but that was long before
saint rita decided
to bless our little town
just one more time 
     bat cracks ball  
   yeah

  sighs  
yes  sir 
your grandfather
once told me
it was okay to think about
what you want to do 
until it was time to start doing
what you were meant to do 
that may not be
what you wanted to hear 
  clears throat  
good night  jimmy 
good night 
i swear  sometimes i think
he lies in bed at night
just figuring out the one thing
that he can say
that hurts the most 
i was this close
to thinking
he was gonna give me
some good advice 
maybe he did 
what 
oh  boy    sighs  
listen  jimmy  i love you 
lord knows i think it s great
you going out there
and showing up the kids
at the tryout 
but i m a little concerned that
you might be losing sight
of the fact you have a family
who needs you
and a pretty decent job waiting
for you up at fort worth 
for the record  all right 
i never said
i was gonna do this 
oh  come on  jimmy 
i know you 
although i was hoping for
a little bit more support
on the home front 
oh  so this doesn t concern
me   or the kids 
you can t eat dreams 
jimmy 
and they don t pay for clothes
or shoes or gas or babysitters 
now  i do not want to be
the bad guy in this 
but somebody around here
has got to start
being rational 
you know what  
that s all i ve been
my whole life 
yeah 
what about my life  
i was there  too 
remember 
every time you got hurt 
i got a front row seat
to watch you shut yourself off
from the rest of the world   
and from me 
truth is 
i was happy when you quit 
happy 
yeah   
because i don t want to see you
get hurt again 
  clears throat  
  exhales deeply  
  footsteps approaching  
  sighs   kids down 
for a while  at least 
i m sorry 
yeah 
me too 
  exhales deeply  
i ve been thinking   
so have l 
i think you should do this 
no  no 
you were right 
no  i don t think so 
we ve got an 8 year old boy
inside this house
who waited all day in the sun
and the rain
to see his daddy
try to do something
that nobody believed
he could do 
now  what are we telling him
if  
if you don t try now 
  smacks lips  
i can t leave you here
with all this

finally tonight 
dreams that don t die 
in 1983 
the milwaukee brewers
drafted a pitcher
named jim morris 
you ve never heard of him   
arm troubles 
he quickly dropped out of
baseball  married  had kids 
taught high school chemistry 
pitching batting practice
to the high school kids 
he found he was throwing
the ball 95 miles an hour   
faster than he could throw it
years ago 
he doesn t know
how that happened 
but guess what it did
to his dream 
here s aaron brown 
aaron brown    on television  
jim morris is afraid
to tell his mother
he quit his old job
as a high school teacher
for his new one  a relief
pitcher in the minor leagues 
he is really old   
too old to be in the minors   
but he s also throwing harder
and better
than he did
as a 20 year old kid 
and so he s back in that
strange and wonderful land
called minor league baseball 
where the bull snorts smoke
on every home run 
and future stars
run the bases between innings 
jimmy    on television  
i made a challenge to the guys
to  uh  follow their dreams 
really  it was something to   
to motivate them 
and  uh  they turned it around
on me
and  uh  told me i wasn t
following my own dreams 
    and washed
the spider out  
be quiet
