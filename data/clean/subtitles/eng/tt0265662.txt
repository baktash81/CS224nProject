a story of the towns
beginnings
its the story
of the santa rita number one
birthplace
of west texas oil
now as with
most texas legends
there was a man who thought oil
was right beneath his feet
and as with
most such stories
no one else believed him
except in this case
for two nuns
who in 1923 met the man
and believed so much in him
and his dream
that they invested money
no one knew they had
now when the nuns told
their parish priest
about the mans dream
and their investment in it
now he counseled them
to try and get their money back
sheepishly they admitted
that it was too late
that the money
was already spent
well the priest he sighed
shook his head
and offered just
one small bit of advice
bless the site
with rose petals
and invoke the help
of saint rita
patron saint
of impossible dreams
and while the workers
waited for the oil
that would eventually come
they played baseball
oil worker
hes outta here
played baseball so well
that some were able to give up
the dirt and the despair
and went on to play
majorleague ball
in the glory days
of ruth and gehrig
lndistinct talking
come on
ive heard and told
that story on many occasions
but that was long before
saint rita decided
to bless our little town
just one more time

the milwaukee brewers
drafted a pitcher
named jim morris
youve never heard of him
arm troubles
he quickly dropped out of
baseball married had kids
taught high school chemistry
pitching batting practice

the ball 95 miles an hour
faster than he could throw it
years ago

how that happened

to his dream
heres aaron brown
aaron brown  on television
jim morris is afraid
to tell his mother
he quit his old job
as a highschool teacher
for his new one a relief
pitcher in the minor leagues
he is really old
too old to be in the minors
but hes also throwing harder
and better
than he did
as a 20yearold kid
and so hes back in that
strange and wonderful land
called minorleague baseball
where the bull snorts smoke
on every home run
and future stars
run the bases between innings
jimmy  on television
i made a challenge to the guys
to uh follow their dreams
really it was something to
to motivate them
