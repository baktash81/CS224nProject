criminal element is at work 
and at the moment 
business is good 
so good  in fact  there appear
to be no eyewitnesses   
to any of these crimes 
with complaints ranging
from purse snatching   
to breaking and entering   
police switchboards have been
swamped   
with the angry voices
of more and more citizens   
who have fallen prey
to the recent surge of crime   
that continues
to plague the city 
instead of getting better 
things have gotten worse 
even more alarming
is the baffling   
and often bizarre
nature of these crimes 
merchandise of every size
and description   
from skateboards
to stereo systems   
has been disappearing
from store shelves   
and storage areas
at an alarming rate 
even the victims themselves
rarely glimpse the thieves 
many don t know they ve been
victimized until it s too late 
in fact  police have yet
to come up with an eyewitness 
only a few vague reports   
of young boys or teenagers
at the scenes have been filed 
but whoever is behind these
crimes  one thing is certain 
these are much more than just
a series of random incidents 
come on  hurry up 
good 
crimes without criminals 
an invisible gang at work 
who are we going to call 
unfortunately  the police
are the only ones available   
to combat what some are dubbing
 the silent crime wave  
but perhaps the most
disturbing silence   
is that coming from city hall 
april o neil 
channel three eyewitness news 
you got to stop working so hard 
what  give up all this glamour 
good night 
bad timing

in this you must never lapse 
even those who would be   
our allies would not understand 
our domain is the shadow 
stray from it reluctantly 
for when you do  you must   
strike hard and fade away   
without a trace 
i lost a sai 
then it is gone 
but i can get it back 
raphael    let it go 
your ninja skills

only one truly important lesson

i know it is hard

michaelangelo

how about a five minute game
misconduct for roughing  pal 
hey  bogey

you going to la guardia 
come back here 
i m not finished with you 
damn 
come sit by me 
couldn t this wait till morning 
you will listen now 
my master yoshi s
first rule was   
possess the right thinking 
only then can one receive   
the gifts of strength 
knowledge  and peace 
i have tried to channel
your anger  raphael   
but more remains 
anger clouds the mind 
turned inward 
it is an unconquerable enemy 
you are unique
among your brothers   
for you choose
to face this enemy alone 
but as you face it 
do not forget them 
and do not forget me 
i am here  my son 
april  you could ve called me
last night  you know 
april  you could ve called me
last night  you know 
call it a quirk 
but i like to know   
when one of my best reporters
has been mugged 
i wasn t mugged  charles 
besides 
i knew you d just worry   
and rush over here
like you did this morning 
from now on 
security is gonna escort you   
to that stone age van of yours
every night 
  yes  sir 
  i m not kidding  april 
hey  danny  how s school going 
  fine 
  wonderful 
so wonderful i have to drive
him there every morning now   
just to make sure he goes 
that s what he does
when he wants to ignore me   
sticks his head in those things 
i wonder where the hell
he got those things  anyway 
charles  give the kid a break 
just what is going on
out there  april 
i ve never seen anything
like this before 
it s like
the city s falling apart 
it s getting so you can t step
outside in the daytime anymore 
i ll tell you one thing 
after everything i ve been
hearing out of little tokyo   
sterns is gonna have some
answering to do this afternoon 
just take it easy 
he s already got the mayor
breathing down my neck 
we are presently executing
a plan of redeployment   
that will minimize
response time   
while maximizing coordination
between patrol units   
in a decentralized
networking scheme 
i m not sure i understood
all that  chief sterns 
would you mind repeating it   
in english  perhaps 
what that means  miss o neil 
is everything is well in hand 
hey  guys  look  that s her 
i didn t say that either 
miss o neil 
if you would stick
to asking questions   
i m in love 
what do you know
about an organization   
known as the foot clan 
there is no evidence to link
such a name to these incidents 
are you denying an organization
known as the foot exists 
i m not denying anything 
you re putting words
into my mouth 
find her 
silence her 
  she s great 
  an understatement as usual 
you re telling me 
the girl is a fox 
take a look at the local
weather for this vicinity   
as it stands at this hour 
o neil  get in here 
time me 
just what is it you
hoped to accomplish out there   
besides busting my chops 
i think you know as much
as i do about this foot clan   
and i don t think you re
doing anything about it 
you expect me to waste
precious manpower   
because a few immigrants
are reminded of something   
that supposedly happened
years ago in japan 
have you got something else 
are you trying to tell me
how to do my job 
one minute  seven seconds   
a new record 
oh    great  just great 
we ve been waiting for you 
miss o neil 
am i behind
on my sony payments again 
your mouth may yet bring you
much trouble  miss o neil 
i deliver a message 
shut it 
all right  that s it 
are you crazy 
are you crazy 
yeah  leo  i m crazy 
a loony 
why 
why  oh  i don t know 
 cause i wanted to redecorate 
a couple of throw pillows 
a tv news reporter 
what do you think 
raphael  what are you doing 
she got jumped in the subway 
  i had to bring her here 
  it s the news lady 
can we keep her 
bring water 
cold washcloth  pillow 
far out 
oh  my god 
i m dead  i m dead  aren t i 
  it s ok 
  no  i m dreaming 
i must be dreaming 
those guys in the black pajamas 
they jumped me 
and that rat    i saw you
in the parking lot 
that explains you 
and you guys   
i have no idea
where you came from 
if you will please just sit down
and calm yourself   
i will tell you
where we came from 
it talks 
it is really quite simple 
miss o neil 
and he knows my name  perfect 
fifteen years ago   
why don t i ever dream of
harrison ford 
for 15 years now 
we have lived here 
before that time  i was a pet
of my master yoshi   
mimicking his movements
from my cage   
and learning
the secret art of ninja 
when we were forced to come
to new york   
i found myself for the first
time without a home   
wandering the sewers  scavenging
for whatever i could find 
and then  one day   
i came upon
a shattered glass jar   
and four baby turtles 
that was us 
shut up 
the little ones were crawling
into a strange glowing ooze   
from a broken canister nearby 
i gathered them up
in an old coffee can   
and when
i awoke the next morning   
i received a shock 
for they had doubled in size 
l  too  was growing 
particularly in intellect   
and i was amazed at how
intelligent they seemed 
but nothing could have prepared
me for what happened next 
one of them spoke 
pizza  pizza 
more words followed 
and i began their training   
teaching them all that
i had learned from my master 
radical  radical  radical 
and soon
i gave them all names   
leonardo   
  michaelangelo   
  that s me 
donatello   
and raphael 
i m not dreaming  am i 
i m afraid not 
are you guys sure you
know where you re going 
11th and bleecker 
nope  this is only 9th street 
  get it 
  yuck 
i d like
to invite you all in   
but i don t have anything to
offer you except frozen pizza 
let s go for it 
you said the magic word 
  you guys eat pizza

well  all right   
did she say pizza 
so  you live
in an antique store 
  yep  pizza 
  well  above  actually 
what do you guys
like on your pizza 
just the regular stuff   
flies  stink bugs 
it was a joke 
maybe i ll fight apollo 
and maybe i won t  you know 
what do you think  adrian 
hey  i got another one 
  this is totally cool 
  oh  no  not cagney 
you dirty rat 
you killed my brother 
you dirty rat 
that must be
splinter s favorite 
it was a joke 
and speaking of which 
we better get going 
he worries 
i don t know what to say 
will i ever see you guys again 
indubitably 
that depends on how fast
you stock your pizza 
see you around 
  bye 
  later 
 skipped item nr  365 
no doubt about it 
she loved us 
it was the impressions 
  you wish

awful hard on this story lately

just for a little while 
you know 
what are you talking about 
it s my story  no way 
look at you  you re exhausted 
i just had a rough night 
let somebody else
help you cover city hall 
charles  that s ridiculous

nothing s with me today 
i just thought you might like
a little help 
i don t 
hand me a towel  will you 
where do you keep the towels 
what s wrong 
i just don t want you to see
my unsightly bathtub ring 
out  out  out  out 
i have to get ready for work 
are you sure you won t
reconsider about some help 
danny  will you tell
your father to relax 
i wish 
just don t push
any buttons today 
that was close 
time to switch to decaf  april 
i don t get it  danny 
i make more than enough money
to provide for both of us   
and you re stealing  why 
  i don t know 
  you don t know 
what the heck were you doing
with a car stereo anyway 
or don t you know that either 
  sorry 
  sorry 
not as sorry as you re
going to be after school 
danny  come back here 
check it out  man 
anything you guys want  we got 
anything you want to do    do it

regular or menthol 
read  em and weep  boys 
full house 
go  play 
you 
good 
never lower your eyes
to an enemy 
yes  master tatsu 
master shredder 
money cannot buy the honor
which you have earned tonight 
you make us all proud 
only effort 
discipline  loyalty   
earn the right to wear
the dragon dogi 
you are here because
the outside world rejects you 
this is your family 
i am your father 
i want you all to become
full members of the foot 
there is a new enemy   
freaks of nature
who interfere with our business 
you are my eyes and ears 
find them 
together we will punish these   
creatures 
these    turtles 
master 
this is beginning
to sound less and less   
like your common 
garden variety subway mugging 
she s a good reporter 
she s a babe 
   known as the foot 
i m sorry    the foot 
i know it sounds like a funky
club for podiatrists   
but i ve been speaking with
a lot of japanese americans   
in the past few days who say
that our recent crime wave   
is reminiscent of a secret band
of ninja thieves   
who once operated in japan 
are the police
looking into this 
i ve included everything
in my statement   
but i doubt very much
that chief sterns   
is taking this possible
connection seriously 
well  perhaps
if any of our viewers   
oh  god 
mr  pennington 
chief sterns  office 
pennington  i thought
we had a deal 
you still haven t told us how
you got away from your attacker 
it s really quite incredible 
some citizens of new york
actually came to my rescue 
who says everyone in the
big apple looks the other way 
seriously  june  i would like
to take this opportunity   
to thank one of those
individuals in particular 
and if he s watching 
thanks  raphael 
studly 
hey  look 
i think he s blushing 
i am not 
i think he s
actually turning red 
maybe not 
so what do we do now 
what do you mean 
what do we do now 
splinter s out there somewhere 
i know splinter s out there 
  fight 
  fight 
  kitchen 
  kitchen 
what are we gonna do about it 
what can we do about it 
april s our only link
to these guys 
we have to wait until she
comes up with something 
so that s the plan
from our great leader 
just sit here on our butts 
i never said
i was a great leader 
you sure
act like it sometimes 
well  you act like a jerk
sometimes 
and this attitude of yours
isn t helping anything 
maybe i ll just take
my attitude and leave 
  why don t you 
  i will 
  good 
  great 
go ahead 
we don t need you 
  pork rind 
  pork rind 
damn 
move it  will you 
you re letting him
blow right by you 
can you believe this guy 
don t just   
ninja kick the damn rabbit 
do something 
april  you were great 
thanks  mikey 
she called me mikey 
  hear anything yet 
  not yet 
they re going to repeat the
interview at 5 00 and at 6 00   
and we re going
to have to wait and see   
if it helps generate
any new information 
i told them
to call me here immediately   
if anyone calls the station 
thanks  april 
we really appreciate 
you know  everything 
forget it 
where s raphael 
i was going to give you guys
a tour of the store 
shall we go get him 
he just needs
to blow off some steam 
you guys must be studying the
abridged book of ninja fighting 
i mean  come on 
how do you guys
expect to beat me 
good answer 
i only keep it open part time 
mostly for my dad 
he loved junk  i don t know 
i guess it s kind of dumb
to lose money on a business   
just because
you miss your father 
no  it isn t 
ready 
this place has everything 
just about 
hasn t raph
been gone a long time 
he does it all the time 
he likes it 
are you sure 
don t worry  he ll probably
be back any minute 
  is he   
  no  he s alive    barely 
and i thought
insurance salesmen were pushy 
a fellow chucker  eh 
keep practicing 
take that 
one of these guys knows where
they re holding splinter   
so don t knock them all out 
i don t think
that will be a problem  leo 
gotcha 
hey  donnie 
wheel of fortune  dude 
bisentos now 
i guess
they re not game show fans 
and i thought
everybody loved vanna 
california roll 
what a spaz 
missed again 
good thing these guys
aren t lumberjacks 
no joke 
the only thing safe
in the woods would be the trees 
guys  i m not so sure if this
is  structurally speaking   
such a good time
for your buddies to drop in 
whoa  wipeout 
man  we could really use
raph right about now 
now what 
you guys mind telling me   
what you re doing to
my little green pal over there 
who is the babe 
who the heck is that 
wayne gretzky on steroids 
attack 
we got to get out of here 
help me  there used to be
a trapdoor here to the basement 
come on  you all  three more 
we re getting out of here 
get away  man 
i ll take care of these guys

good idea 
hi  this is april

april  it s charles 
i m sorry  i don t know
how else to say this 
you re fired  april 
i m sorry 
i know this comes as a blow 
you can say that again  chuck 
come on 
bye  guys  got to run 
ninja  vanish 
what are these    freaks 
how do they know how
to fight like this 
you will answer 
then hang there until you die 
master tatsu  stop  please 
please  stop it 
shinsho 
you ll be all right 
how can a face so young
wear so many burdens 
so  you can talk 
yes  and i can also listen 
some say that the path
from inner turmoil   
begins with a friendly ear 
my ear is open
if you care to use it 
i don t think so 
what is your name 
and have you no one to go to 
danny  no parent 
my dad couldn t
care less about me 
i doubt that is true 
why 
all fathers care for their sons 
  how s raphael 
  not so good 
didn t they use this place
in the grapes of wrath 
very funny 
i told you  i haven t been
up here in years 
can you fix it 
does that answer your question 
the block s got a crack
the size of the san andreas 
wonderful 
i guess
i ve got some walking to do 
what for 
our nearest neighbor
is about four miles away 
i need to get to a phone 
and i need to call my boss 
you mean charles 
how did you know that 
he left a message on your
machine just before we got out 
you just saved yourself
an eight mile round tripper 
you were fired 
i just saved myself   
did you take classes
in insensitivity 
i was just trying
to break it to you easy 
you failed miserably 
broadzilla  you wouldn t be
here if it weren t for me 
and what do you want 
do you want a thank you 
it s me who should thank you
for that privilege  right 
fine 
thank you 
you re welcome 
it s kind of like moonlighting 
isn t it 
it s strange being back
on the old farm 
even after all these years 
it still feels like home 
my amazing new friends   
have suffered
their first real defeat 
that s bad enough  but they ve
also lost the opportunity   
to find out
about their mentor   
and i m sure that hurts them
more than anything else 
each of them deals with
this confusion in his own way 
donatello has found
someone to latch onto 
not even close  zip neck 
the professor and mary ann 
happily ever after 
no way  atomic mouth 
gilligan was her main man 
they d be married
and have six kids by now 
gilligan was a geek 
barfarooni 
you re the geek  camel breath 
dome head 
elf lips 
let s give this a try 
see if this transplant
worked    fungoid 
here goes  what are we on 
 g  
here goes  gack face 
i m ready  hose brain 
it worked 
leonardo  meanwhile  has kept
a constant vigil with raphael 
he ll be ok 
and then there s casey jones   
a nine year old
trapped in a man s body 
he might almost be cute if it
wasn t for that pigheadedness 
he s out with the others 
exercising 
doing something together 
i don t know 
want some help 
i don t know 
i am your man 
i am mr  fix it 
let s go 
lead the way  toots 
toots 
babe 
sweetcakes 
princess 
do you want to throw me a clue
here  i m drowning 
you know what  that s ok 
i ll take care of it myself 
that s up to you 
just don t come around here
asking for my help anymore 
i wouldn t
ask for your help   
if you were the last thing
on the face of this planet 
it s coming along nicely 
what 
you re awake 
how do you feel 
what s a guy got to do to get
some food around here 
he s awake 
he wants some food 
bring some food 
you re going to be ok  raph 
get a grip  will you 
listen  raph   
about what i said before   
about not needing you and all   
leo  don t 
oh  boy  we missed you 
it s a kodak moment 
the turtles are four
once again   
and yet  still not whole 
a lingering doubt remains   
an unknown which
they can t bear to face   
their greatest fear 
your empire flourishes 
master shredder 
what more from the rat 
nothing  it will not speak 
and the boy
who led us to the turtles 
he is still missing 
i do not understand 
why do the turtles
trouble you  master 
they have not been seen
for many days 
something about the way you
described their fighting   
something familiar 
something    from the past 
ointment 
funny  mikey 
what russian novel  embracing
more than 500 characters   
is set in the napoleonic wars 
war and peace 
he s alive 
thanks  spaz 
splinter s alive 
we know  leo  of course he is 
we all think he s alive 
i don t think 
i know 
leo  if you dragged us
out here for nothing   
don t worry  i came prepared 
put those away 
everybody close your eyes
and concentrate 
concentrate hard 
i am proud of you  my sons 
tonight you have learned   
the final and greatest truth
of the ninja   
that ultimate mastery comes
not of the body   
but of the mind 
together  there is nothing   
your four minds
cannot accomplish 
help each other 
draw upon one another 
and always remember
the true force that binds you   
the same as that which
brought me here tonight   
that which i gladly return
with my final words 
i love you all  my sons 
so you actually
played professionally 
before i got hurt 
less than a year 
i m sorry 
so was i 
just a minute 
guys  i told you   
i hate it when
you do that  all right 
what is it 
it s time to go back 
home sweet home 
now i know what it s like
to travel without a green card 
this isn t bad 
nice place  guys 
you coming or not  dude 
this is great 
first  it s the farm
that time forgot  and now this 
why don t i ever fall in
with people who own condos 
guess it s hard to get
good maid service in a sewer 
maybe you guys should try
roto rooter 
would you quit complaining 
it s just for the night 
i still don t see why we don t
get started right away 
it s been a long drive  raph   
and before we go out advertising
to the foot that we re back   
we could all use
a few hours  sleep 
you re right  i m just   
what s that 
don t shoot 
i don t think it s loaded  kid 
danny  what are you doing here 
  hey  where d he come from 
  beats me 
i ran away from home 
your father s
going to have kittens 
does this thing work 
please don t call 
just let me stay here
the night with you 
we can call in the morning 
i promise 
danny  listen   
hold on 
what is all this talk about
spending the night down here 
you re a claustrophobic 
do you want a fist in the mouth 
i ve never even looked
at another guy before 
what he means is that you re
afraid of enclosed areas 
afraid 
what  me 
is that what you think 
i don t have to take
this stuff about being afraid 
i m going to sleep in the truck 
these are good 
do you think
maybe i could have one 
ure  why not 
i could really go   
for a little deep dish action
right about now 
i had some pizza down here
the other day 
there might be some left over 
  well 
  question 
do you like penicillin
on your pizza 
 afraid of enclosed areas  
you are here because
the outside world rejects you 
and you have
no one to go to  danny 
this is your family 
all fathers
care for their sons 
look out  man 
i have not seen you for days 
i ve been down
at my hideout a lot lately 
and do you now hide from
your surrogate family as well 
i don t know 
l  too  once
had a family  danny 
many years ago 
i lived in japan   
a pet of my master yoshi   
mimicking his movements
from my cage   
and learning the mysterious art
of ninjitsu 
for yoshi was one of japan s
finest shadow warriors 
his only rival was a man
named oruku saki   
and they competed
in all things   
but none more fiercely
than for the love of a woman   
tang shen 
shen s love
was only for my master   
and rather than see him fight
saki for her hand   
she persuaded yoshi
to flee with me to america 
but saki vowed vengeance 
i remember it well
as my master returned home   
to find his beloved shen
lying on the floor 
and then he saw her killer 
saki wasted no words 
and during the struggle   
my cage was broken 
i leapt to saki s face 
biting and clawing   
but he threw me to the floor   
and took one swipe with
his katana  slicing my ear 
then he was gone 
and i was alone 
whatever happened
to this oruku saki 
no one really knows 
but you wear his symbol
upon your brow 
what are you
doing in there  boy 
nothing 
where have you been 
nowhere 
you re lying to me 
and you re hiding
something as well 
they re back 
master 
there will be
no mistake this time 
i go myself 
and the rat   
kill it 
what do you want 
recognize me now  kid 
what s the deal 
you got to come with me 
what are you talking about 
come with you 
they re going to kill splinter 
no sweat 
i do hope
there s more of them 
good 
where are the keys 
who are you 
the name s casey jones 
a friend 
let s get out of here 
a little to the right   
a little to the left 
one more time 
a little bit
more like    that 
and stop  perfect 
you re a natural  sis 
a little primatene might just
help to clear that up there 
that s going to cost you 
tinkerbell 
i don t think
that you re listening 
you know 
i m starting to pick up   
on a little language barrier
thing going here 
fore 
i ll never call golf
a dull game again 
gangway 
show off 
what are we just standing
here for  let s get him 
do you want to be first  junior 
we have a loyalty
to the shredder 
the shredder uses you 
he poisons your minds to obtain
that which he desires 
he cares nothing for you
or the people you hurt 
we re a family 
family  is that what you said 
you call this here
and that down there  family  
hey  dudes  where you going 
donnie  looks like this one s
suffering from shell shock 
too derivative 
boy  i guess we can
really shell it out 
too cliche 
well  it was
a shell of a good hit 
i like it  step up 
awesome 
where do you think you re going 
wait for me 
god  i love being a turtle 
aw  no more 
does anybody have any idea
about who or what this is 
i don t know   
but i ll bet it never has
to look for a can opener 
you fight well
in the old style   
but you ve caused me
enough trouble 
now you face   
the shredder 
maybe all that hardware s
for making coleslaw 
i got him 
this guy s good 
why don t you go next 
match you for it 
damn  great 
come on 
so much for family 
now    at exactly what point   
did we lose control here 
maybe somebody ought to tell
him that we re the good guys 
any thoughts 
i ve only got one thought 
this guy knows
where splinter is 
looks like your boys are
going to need a little   
where did he go 
leftovers

where s splinter 
ah  the rat 
so it has a name

the three of you
might have overpowered me   
with the loss of but one 
now your fate will be his 
yes  oruku saki 
i know who you are 
we met many years ago   
in the home of my master   
hamato yoshi 
it s him 
now i will finish
what i began with your ear 
death comes for us all 
oruku saki   
but something much worse
comes for you 
for when you die  it will be   
without honor
