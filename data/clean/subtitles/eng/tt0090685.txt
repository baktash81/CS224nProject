jason i said it before

i dont care how rich

without an education
hes nothing

you can be whatever
you want to be
you want to be a loser
be a loser
you want to be a winner

im going to college
what do you think
what do i think
i think youre nuts
nuts huh who made the rules
come here im going to college
im going to college
let me get this straight
mr melon
you wish to enter
this widely esteemed
grand lakes university of ours
as a freshman
thats right dean martin
are you comfortable
im fine yeah
oh the chair im sorry
this is an awkward moment
for me mr melon
since i realize youre
a highly respected member
of our business community
thank you
youre welcome
our student body here
is handpicked by me
from the crème de la crème
of students all across
this great land of ours
thats one of the things
i like about this place
yes the point is though
since you have
no high school diploma
and no transcripts of any kind
no sat scores
and youre 30 to 40 years older
than our average freshman
how can this university
ever see its way clear
to accept you as a student
as calvin coolidge once said
the business of america
is business
and the business of
an educational institution
such as ours
is to create young minds
that understand that
the business of america
is the kind of business
that it actually is
so whatever it is that
i have said here today
the point is
that we are here to honor
our most generous benefactor
and newest freshman
the man whos
made it possible
for us to break ground
here today
mr thornton melon
dean martin great speech
theres nothing like good
clean business huh
and a little monkey business
oh philip im so glad
you could make it
mr melon id like for you
to meet dr philip barbay
whos the dean
of our school of business
david i just want
to get it on record
that i am totally against this
i dont think
that selling admission
to an obviously
unqualified student
is very ethical or honorable
right phil
but id just like to say
in all fairness
to mr melon here
it was a really big check
its a simple matter
of this mans presence
undermining the efforts
of our legitimate students
who are here as a result
of hard work
hard work
listen sherlock while you were
tucked away up here
working on your ethics
i was out there
busting my hump
in the real world
and the reason guys like you
got a place to teach
is cause guys like me
donate buildings
i wasnt speaking to you
mr melon
i dont think
dr barbay understands
the actual amounts
that are involved here
mr melon will you take
the ceremonial shovel
thank you
and dig into the symbolic dirt
i hereby dedicate
this building to myself
now dad its just like
we talked about
you sign up for whatever
interests you ok
were gonna get
on the astronomy line
before it closes up
see you later
look at this
this is worse than the track
you want me to move
some people for you
no dont push anybody around
this is college
let me think for a minute
what are you gonna do
come on i got an idea
did you get
everything you want
i got the latin
and the sanskrit
but then they canceled
my ancient greek
just blew my whole
dead languages motif
what are you looking at
you ok
yeah yeah im fine
im just upset
because they closed botany
those bastards
well im not that upset
at least i wont be
if i get into astronomy
you want to cut
into line with us
cause were already waiting
yes yeah i would
great all right
oh this is derek
hi
im valerie desmond
yeah i know
im jason melon
hi
hey valerie
hi
god you look great
thanks are you taking
astronomy too
yeah i guess so
i dont really want to
im a business major
but for some reason
they want us to take a science
you mind if i sneak
in the line with you
actually these guys were
nice enough to let me in
so its really
up to them i guess
melon buddy
whaddaya say let me in ok
i dont think so osbourne
melon your friend
straighten him out
look chas
theres a lot of people waiting
it wouldnt really be fair
ill tell you what
maybe if you got a note
from each of these people
saying that it was all right
then wed reconsider
but until that day
take a hike
you elitist fraternity scumbag
i wont forget this melon
ill see you at the pool
bye val
bye
thank you im dead
youre not gonna believe this
youre kidding
im not kidding just go
hes out there
bruce bruce bruce bruce
where is he
i dont know kid
all i know is im supposed
to pick him up here
when
now
come on lets register
hey you guys
get everything you need
oh yeah we got it
good whats with
the used books
whats wrong with used books
theyve already been read
and theyve already been
underlined
thats the problem
the guy who underlined them
could have been a maniac
get these guys some new books
charge it to me too
here pick a card
and im taking four
of those school sweaters
a bunch of pennants
some of those beer mugs
a few of these fuzz balls
you cheer with and
hey folks its on me
shakespeare for everyone ok
you too honey
id like to tame your shrew
who is that
that is mr thornton melon
the worlds oldest
living freshman
and the walking epitome of
the decline of modern education
the stupid clod thinks he can
buy his way out of the gutter
i dont think so
he was just having fun
oh really well i cant wait
to get him in my class
well see how much fun
he is then
oh philip
hey mr m youre all set
weve been working all night
we got it all done
thanks buzzy
i appreciate it
add a few hundred to the bill
and throw your boys a party
you know what you got mr m
you got class
it rubbed off from you buzzy
say hello to sonia for me huh
you got it
i want to talk to you
about my schedule
well go over it later
well boys
what do you think
got a hot tub in there
how can you study
if youre not relaxed
whens our first class
we got economics
tomorrow at 1100
1100 no good
i got a massage at 1100
tell them to make it 200
no dad you dont get it
theyre not gonna reschedule
the classes around your massage
all right 1100
but im gonna talk to that dean
these classes can be
a real inconvenience
all right settle down people
weve got a lot to cover
and time is short
there are two kinds of people
in business today
the quick and the dead
so rather than waste
your time this semester
with a lot of
useless theories
were going to jump right in
with both feet
and create a fictional company
from the ground up
well construct
our physical plant
well set up
an efficient administrative
and executive structure
then well manufacture
our product and market it
i think youll find it very
interesting and a lot of fun
so lets start by looking
at construction costs
of our new factory
whats the product
that is immaterial
for the purposes
of our discussion here
but if it makes you happy
lets say were making
tape recorders
tape recorders
are you kiddin
the japs will kill us
on the labor costs
ok fine
then lets just say
theyre widgets
whats a widget
its a fictional product
it doesnt matter
doesnt matter
tell that to the bank
take it easy
its the first day
on the board
you will see a cost analysis
for construction of
a 30000 squarefoot facility
which will encompass
both factory and office space
and is fully serviced
by all utilities
a railroad spur line
and a fourbay shipping dock
hold it hold it why build
youre better off leasing
at a buck and a quarter
a buck and a half a square foot
take your down payment
and put it into cds
or something else you can roll
over every couple of months
thank you mr melon
but well be concentrating
on finance
a little later in the term
for the time being
lets just concentrate
on the construction figures
shall we
youll see the final bottom line
requires the factoring in
of not just the material
and construction costs
but also the architects fees
and the cost of land servicing
oh you left out
a bunch of stuff
oh really
like what for instance
first of all you have to grease
the local politicians
for the sudden zoning problems
that always come up
then theres the kickbacks
to the carpenters
and if you plan on using
any cement in this building
im sure the teamsters
would like to have
a little chat with you
and thatll cost you
dont forget a little something
for the building inspectors
theres the longterm costs
such as waste disposal
i dont know if youre familiar
with who runs that business
but i assure you
its not the boy scouts
that will be quite enough
mr melon
maybe bribes and kickbacks
and mafia payoffs
are how you do business
but they are not part of
the legitimate business world
and theyre certainly
not part of anything
im teaching in this class
do i make myself clear
sorry just trying to help
thats all
now notwithstanding
mr melons input
the next question for us is
where to build our factory
how about fantasyland
my first class
i did good huh
you better cool it
with dr barbay
dr barbay he dont know dick
he really tells it
like it aint
know what he knows how to do
flunk you
flunk me flunk him
great attitude do you know
where your next class is
contemporary american history
professor turgeson
turgeson
you know him is he good
well hes really committed
in fact i think he was
just keep your head down
and your mouth shut
you should be all right
ill see you in english
all right
welcome to contemporary
american history
im professor turgeson
i know a lot of people
think history is just facts
just information about the past
but not me
i hold history
very sacred sacred
the way a farmer looks at
the earth and holds it sacred
the way a christian
takes the bible
and he holds it sacred
the way a lot of people
hold their marriage sacred
thats how i feel about it
so why dont we dive right in
by interpreting
one of the easiest events
in the last twenty years
of american history
now can someone tell me
why in 1975 we pulled
our troops out of vietnam
the failure of vietnamization
to win popular support
caused an ongoing erosion
of confidence
in the various american
but illegal saigon regimes
is she right
cause i know
thats the popular version
of what went on there
i know a lot of people
like to believe that
i wish i could
but i was there
i wasnt here in a classroom
hoping i was right
thinking about it
i was up to my knees
in rice paddies
with guns that didnt work
going up against charlie
slugging it out with him
while pussies like you
were back here partyin
puttin headbands on
doin drugs listening
to the goddamn beatle albums
hey professor
take it easy will ya
these kids were in grade school
at the time
and me
im not a fighter im a lover
well i didnt know you wanted
to get involved
with the discussion
mr helper
but since you want to help
maybe you can help me ok
you remember that thing
we had about thirty years ago
called the korean conflict
yeah where we failed
to achieve victory
how come we didnt cross
the 38th parallel
and push those riceeaters back
to the great wall of china
and take it apart
brick by brick
and nuke them back into
the fuckin stone age forever
how come tell me
why say it say it
all right ill say it
cause truman was too much
of a pussy wimp
to let macarthur go in and blow
out those commie bastards
good answer good answer
i like the way you think
im gonna be watching you
good teacher
he really seems to care
about what i have no idea
college is all right
ill tell you that
hey buddy be my guest
heres a pen
boys heres a couple of pens
in case you learn how to write
i know you
oh yeah heres a pen
you do those
obnoxious commercials
youre tall and fat
yeah youre short and ugly
give me the pen back will ya
honey heres a pen
boys how are ya
and gibraltar is a girl
where i was a flower
of the mountain
yes when i put
the rose in my hair
like the
andalusian girls used
or shall i wear red

under the moorish wall
and i thought
well as well him as another
and then i ask him
with my eyes to ask again
yes and then he asked me
would i yes to say yes
my mountain flower
and first i put my arms
around him yes
and drew him down to me
so he could feel my breasts
all perfumed yes
and his heart was going
like mad and yes
i said yes i will yes
yes yes

of confidence

by f scott fitzgerald
mr melon how would you
characterize the great gatsby
who him
no you
me
well the great gatsby
he was
great
see me after class mr melon
i mean please
try to understand
i dont have
the background for this
the high school i went to
they asked a kid to prove
the law of gravity
he threw the teacher
out the window
i know what i need
i need a tutor
what do you say come on
you got some spare time
all right mr melon
i have some spare time
this evening
why dont you come around
about 700
great
ill give you my address
thanks
please be on time
ill be on time
what penmanship
everywhere the ceremony
of innocence is drowned
the best
lack all conviction
while the worst are full
of passionate intensity
theres a lot
of other stuff here
yeats goes on and on
and heres the finish
what rough beast
its hour come round at last
slouches towards bethlehem
to be born
what does that
make you think of
rough beast my exwife
well thats
one interpretation
not the right one
but its a start
surely a man of your age
and experience
must have read some
of the things on my list
what about macbeth
i saw the movie
orson welles
great actor big actor
he was a tall and fat
customer for years
how about
cat on a hot tin roof
i saw the movie burl lves
great actor extra stout
he was a customer too
streetcar named desire
great movie marlon brando
he wasnt that big then
but he ballooned up nicely
id say pound for pound
our finest american actor
dont you ever read
who has time i see the movie
im in and out in two hours
oh thornton dont you see
the reason you want
to read these works
is so you can experience them
for yourself
so you can share the thoughts
and feelings of the writer
without the interference
of your actor and director
and professors point of view
getting in the way
to truly share
and understand
the common feelings
of all mankind
the feelings of being alive
that was beautiful
i understand
what youre saying too
im glad
that makes me feel good
i got an idea
lets keep talking over dinner
im supposed to meet
someone for dinner
i could cancel
though i guess
we are working after all
you cant work
on an empty stomach
you cant concentrate
when youre hungry
oh i dont know
i really shouldnt
i have so many things to do
oh come on ill help you
ill take out the garbage
ill do the dishes
ill do your nails
ill do your hair
you have no idea
what i want to do
ill call him
ill dial it
ill just get the light
i think im attracted
to teachers
i took out an english teacher
that didnt work out at all
i sent her a love letter
she corrected it
oh great company
those two ought to get a room
really
actually
i was married twice
my first wife jasons mother
i really loved her
we had a good thing going
you know
she passed away
about ten years ago
after that i screwed around
for a few years
then i really went nuts
i married vanessa
i was just lonely i guess
is that over now
we were doomed from the start
im an earth sign
shes a water sign
together we made mud
i picked a beauty
and she played around too
when she said i do
i should have said with who
so are you
giving up on women
i dont know
i cant figure women out
today theyre independent
they only think
about themselves
during sex vanessa used
to scream out her own name
i think its the men
who are different
ever since
the womens movement
most of the men i meet
go out of their way
to show you
how sensitive they are
before they were too macho
and now theyre too soft
you all want us to know
you can cry
no with women
i never cry never
i beg
if we finish
this bottle of wine
you wont have to beg
diane
oh philip
we were supposed
to go to dinner
i just had dinner
i dont believe this
maybe its a dream

situation on our hands here
phil would you repeat
to mr melon
the allegations
that youve made to me
its clear the work youve
handed in is not your own
im accusing you
of academic fraud
fraud is such an ugly word
considering
the financial generosity
that mr melon has shown
towards our fine university
i think mr melon
should be expelled

well thornton
im only going
to ask you this one time
is the work that
you turned in your own
i cant lie to you
dean martin
yes it is
im satisfied
phil
im outraged
gee whiz phil

blind eyes could blaze
like meteors and be gay

the dying of the light
