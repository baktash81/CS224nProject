and successful a man is 
without an education

you can be whatever

you don t have to do any of it 
ok  then 
i ll do it with you 
what do you mean 
you ll do it with me 
i mean just what i said 
i m going to college 
what do you think 
what do i think 
i think you re nuts 
nuts  huh  who made the rules 
come here  i m going to college 
i m going to college 
let me get this straight 
mr  melon 
you wish to enter
this widely esteemed   
grand lakes university of ours
as a freshman 
that s right  dean martin 
  are you comfortable 
  i m fine  yeah 
oh  the chair  i m sorry 
this is an awkward moment
for me  mr  melon   
since i realize you re
a highly respected member   
of our business community 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
our student body here
is handpicked by me   
from the crème de la crème   
of students all across
this great land of ours 
that s one of the things
i like about this place 
yes  the point is  though   
since you have
no high school diploma   
and no transcripts of any kind 
no s a t  scores   
and you re 30 to 40 years older
than our average freshman   
how can this university
ever see its way clear   
to accept you as a student 
as calvin coolidge once said   
 the business of america
is business    
and the business of
an educational institution   
such as ours
is to create young minds   
that understand that
the business of america   
is the kind of business
that it actually is 
so  whatever it is that
i have said here today   
the point is
that we are here to honor   
our most generous benefactor   
and newest freshman   
the man who s
made it possible   
for us to break ground
here today   
mr  thornton melon 
dean martin  great speech 
there s nothing like good 
clean business  huh 
and a little monkey business 
oh  philip  i m so glad
you could make it 
mr  melon  i d like for you
to meet dr  philip barbay   
who s the dean
of our school of business 
david  i just want
to get it on record   
that i am totally against this 
i don t think
that selling admission   
to an obviously
unqualified student   
is very ethical or honorable 
right  phil 
but i d just like to say   
in all fairness
to mr  melon here   
it was a really big check 
it s a simple matter
of this man s presence   
undermining the efforts
of our legitimate students   
who are here as a result
of hard work 
hard work 
listen  sherlock  while you were
tucked away up here   
working on your ethics 
i was out there   
busting my hump
in the real world 
and the reason guys like you
got a place to teach   
is  cause guys like me
donate buildings 
i wasn t speaking to you 
mr  melon 
i don t think
dr  barbay understands   
the actual amounts
that are involved here 
mr  melon  will you take
the ceremonial shovel 
thank you 
and dig into the symbolic dirt 
i hereby dedicate
this building to    myself 
now  dad  it s just like
we talked about 
you sign up for whatever
interests you  ok 
we re gonna get
on the astronomy line   
before it closes up 
see you later 
look at this 
this is worse than the track 
you want me to move
some people for you 
no  don t push anybody around 
this is college 
let me think for a minute 
what are you gonna do 
come on  i got an idea 
did you get
everything you want 
i got the latin
and the sanskrit   
but then they canceled
my ancient greek 
just blew my whole
dead languages motif 
what are you looking at 
you ok 
yeah  yeah  i m fine 
i m just upset
because they closed botany 
those bastards 
well  i m not that upset 
at least  i won t be
if i get into astronomy 
you want to cut
into line with us 
 cause we re already waiting 
yes  yeah  i would 
great  all right 
oh  this is derek 
hi 
i m valerie desmond 
yeah  i know 
  i m jason melon 
  hi 
  hey  valerie 
  hi 
god  you look great 
thanks  are you taking
astronomy  too 
yeah  i guess so 
i don t really want to 
i m a business major 
but for some reason 
they want us to take a science 
you mind if i sneak
in the line with you 
actually  these guys were
nice enough to let me in   
so it s really
up to them  i guess 
melon  buddy 
whaddaya say  let me in  ok 
i don t think so  osbourne 
melon  your friend   
straighten him out 
look  chas 
there s a lot of people waiting 
it wouldn t really be fair 
i ll tell you what 
maybe if you got a note
from each of these people   
saying that it was all right 
then we d reconsider   
but until that day 
take a hike   
you elitist fraternity scumbag 
i won t forget this  melon 
i ll see you at the pool 
  bye  val 
  bye 
thank you  i m dead 
you re not gonna believe this 
  you re kidding 
  i m not kidding  just go 
he s out there 
bruce  bruce  bruce  bruce 
where is he 
i don t know  kid 
all i know is i m supposed
to pick him up here 
  when 
  now 
come on  let s register 
hey  you guys
get everything you need 
oh  yeah  we got it 
good  what s with
the used books 
  what s wrong with used books 
  they ve already been read 
and they ve already been
underlined 
that s the problem 
the guy who underlined them
could have been a maniac 
get these guys some new books 
charge it to me  too 
here  pick a card 
and i m taking four
of those school sweaters   
a bunch of pennants 
some of those beer mugs   
a few of these fuzz balls
you cheer with  and   
hey  folks  it s on me 
shakespeare for everyone  ok 
you  too  honey 
i d like to tame your shrew 
  who is that 
  that is mr  thornton melon   
the world s oldest
living freshman   
and the walking epitome of
the decline of modern education 
the stupid clod thinks he can
buy his way out of the gutter 
i don t think so 
he was just having fun 
oh  really  well  i can t wait
to get him in my class 
we ll see how much fun
he is then 
oh  philip 
hey  mr  m  you re all set 
we ve been working all night 
we got it all done 
thanks  buzzy 
i appreciate it 
add a few hundred to the bill
and throw your boys a party 
you know what you got  mr  m 
you got class 
it rubbed off from you  buzzy 
say hello to sonia for me  huh 
you got it 
i want to talk to you
about my schedule 
we ll go over it later 
well  boys 
what do you think 
got a hot tub in there 
how can you study
if you re not relaxed 
when s our first class 
we got economics
tomorrow at 11 00 
11 00  no good 
i got a massage at 11 00 
tell them to make it 2 00 
no  dad  you don t get it 
they re not gonna reschedule
the classes around your massage 
all right  11 00 
but i m gonna talk to that dean 
these classes can be
a real inconvenience 
all right  settle down  people 
we ve got a lot to cover 
and time is short 
there are two kinds of people
in business today   
the quick and the dead 
so  rather than waste
your time this semester   
with a lot of
useless theories   
we re going to jump right in
with both feet   
and create a fictional company
from the ground up 
we ll construct
our physical plant   
we ll set up
an efficient administrative   
and executive structure   
then we ll manufacture
our product and market it 
i think you ll find it very
interesting and a lot of fun 
so  let s start by looking
at construction costs   
of our new factory 
what s the product 
that is immaterial   
for the purposes
of our discussion here   
but if it makes you happy   
let s say we re making
tape recorders 
tape recorders 
are you kiddin  
the japs will kill us
on the labor costs 
ok  fine 
then let s just say
they re widgets 
what s a widget 
it s a fictional product 
it doesn t matter 
doesn t matter 
tell that to the bank 
take it easy 
it s the first day 
on the board 
you will see a cost analysis   
for construction of
a 30 000 square foot facility   
which will encompass
both factory and office space   
and is fully serviced
by all utilities   
a railroad spur line
and a four bay shipping dock 
hold it  hold it  why build 
you re better off leasing   
at a buck and a quarter 
a buck and a half a square foot 
take your down payment
and put it into cds   
or something else you can roll
over every couple of months 
thank you  mr  melon   
but we ll be concentrating
on finance   
a little later in the term 
for the time being 
let s just concentrate   
on the construction figures 
shall we 
you ll see the final bottom line
requires the factoring in   
of not just the material
and construction costs   
but also the architects  fees
and the cost of land servicing 
oh  you left out
a bunch of stuff 
oh  really 
like what  for instance 
first of all  you have to grease
the local politicians   
for the sudden zoning problems
that always come up 
then there s the kickbacks
to the carpenters 
and if you plan on using
any cement in this building   
i m sure the teamsters
would like to have   
a little chat with you 
and that ll cost you 
don t forget a little something
for the building inspectors 
there s the long term costs 
such as waste disposal 
i don t know if you re familiar
with who runs that business   
but i assure you
it s not the boy scouts 
that will be quite enough 
mr  melon 
maybe bribes and kickbacks   
and mafia payoffs
are how you do business   
but they are not part of
the legitimate business world   
and they re certainly
not part of anything   
i m teaching in this class 
do i make myself clear 
sorry  just trying to help 
that s all 
now  notwithstanding
mr  melon s input   
the next question for us is
where to build our factory 
how about fantasyland 
my first class 
i did good  huh 
you better cool it
with dr  barbay 
dr  barbay  he don t know dick 
he really tells it
like it ain t 
know what he knows how to do 
flunk you 
flunk me  flunk him 
great attitude  do you know
where your next class is 
contemporary american history 
professor turgeson 
  turgeson 
  you know him  is he good 
well  he s really committed 
in fact  i think he was 
just keep your head down   
and your mouth shut 
you should be all right 
  i ll see you in english 
  all right 
welcome to contemporary
american history 
i m professor turgeson 
i know a lot of people
think history is just facts   
just information about the past 
but not me 
i hold history
very sacred  sacred 
the way a farmer looks at
the earth and holds it sacred 
the way a christian
takes the bible   
and he holds it sacred 
the way a lot of people
hold their marriage sacred 
that s how i feel about it 
so why don t we dive right in   
by interpreting
one of the easiest events   
in the last twenty years
of american history 
now  can someone tell me   
why  in 1975  we pulled
our troops out of vietnam 
the failure of vietnamization
to win popular support   
caused an ongoing erosion
of confidence   
in the various american   
but illegal    saigon regimes 
is she right 
 cause i know
that s the popular version   
of what went on there 
i know a lot of people
like to believe that 
i wish i could 
but i was there 
i wasn t here in a classroom   
hoping i was right 
thinking about it 
i was up to my knees
in rice paddies   
with guns that didn t work 
going up against charlie   
slugging it out with him 
while pussies like you   
were back here partyin  
puttin  headbands on   
doin  drugs  listening
to the goddamn beatle albums 
hey  professor 
take it easy  will ya 
these kids were in grade school
at the time 
and me   
i m not a fighter  i m a lover 
well  i didn t know you wanted
to get involved   
with the discussion 
mr  helper 
but since you want to help 
maybe you can help me  ok 
you remember that thing
we had about thirty years ago   
called the korean conflict 
yeah  where we failed
to achieve victory 
how come we didn t cross
the 38th parallel   
and push those rice eaters back
to the great wall of china   
and take it apart
brick by brick   
and nuke them back into
the fuckin  stone age forever 
how come  tell me 
why  say it  say it 
all right  i ll say it 
 cause truman was too much

what penmanship 
 everywhere the ceremony
of innocence is drowned 
 the best
lack all conviction   
 while the worst are full
of passionate intensity  
there s a lot
of other stuff here 
yeats goes on and on   
and here s the finish 
 what rough beast 
its hour come round at last   
 slouches towards bethlehem
to be born  
what does that
make you think of 
rough beast  my ex wife 
well  that s
one interpretation 
not the right one 
but it s a start 
surely a man of your age
and experience   
must have read some
of the things on my list 
  what about  macbeth  
  i saw the movie 
orson welles 
great actor  big actor 
he was a tall and fat
customer for years 
how about
 cat on a hot tin roof  
i saw the movie  burl lves 
great actor  extra stout 
he was a customer  too 
   streetcar named desire  
  great movie  marlon brando 
he wasn t that big then 
but he ballooned up nicely 
i d say pound for pound 
our finest american actor 
don t you ever read 
who has time  i see the movie 
i m in and out in two hours 
oh  thornton  don t you see 
the reason you want
to read these works   
is so you can experience them
for yourself   
so you can share the thoughts
and feelings of the writer   
without the interference
of your actor and director   
and professor s point of view
getting in the way   
to truly share
and understand   
the common feelings
of all mankind   
the feelings of being alive 
that was beautiful 
i understand
what you re saying  too 
i m glad 
that makes me feel good 
i got an idea 
let s keep talking over dinner 
i m supposed to meet
someone for dinner 
i could cancel 
though  i guess 
we are working  after all 
you can t work
on an empty stomach 
you can t concentrate
when you re hungry 
oh  i don t know 
i really shouldn t 
  i have so many things to do 
  oh  come on  i ll help you 
i ll take out the garbage 
i ll do the dishes 
i ll do your nails 
i ll do your hair 
you have no idea
what i want to do 
  i ll call him 
  i ll dial it 
i ll just get the light 
i think i m attracted
to teachers 
i took out an english teacher 
that didn t work out at all 
i sent her a love letter 
she corrected it 
oh  great  company 
  those two ought to get a room 
  really 
actually 
i was married twice 
my first wife  jason s mother 
i really loved her 
we had a good thing going 
you know 
she passed away
about ten years ago 
after that  i screwed around
for a few years 
then i really went nuts   
i married vanessa 
i was just lonely  i guess 
is that over now 
we were doomed from the start 
i m an earth sign 
she s a water sign 
together  we made mud 
i picked a beauty 
and she played around  too 
when she said   i do  
i should have said   with who  
so  are you
giving up on women 
i don t know 
i can t figure women out 
today  they re independent 
they only think
about themselves 
during sex  vanessa used
to scream out her own name 
i think it s the men
who are different 
ever since
the women s movement   
most of the men i meet
go out of their way   
to show you
how sensitive they are 
before they were too macho 
and now they re too soft 
you all want us to know
you can cry 
no  with women 
i never cry  never 
i beg 
if we finish
this bottle of wine   
you won t have to beg 
diane 
oh  philip 
we were supposed
to go to dinner 
i just had dinner 
i don t believe this 
maybe it s a dream 
good night  philip

it s a nice improvement 
thank you 
diane  why d you fail me

you failed me 
  is it because of last night 
  no  i can accept the fact   
that you re completely
regressed emotionally   
but you won t pass my course by
turning in someone else s work 
what do you think 
someone else wrote this 
all i know is that you didn t 
that s what disappoints me 
whoever did write it   
doesn t know the first thing
about kurt vonnegut

a potentially unpleasant
situation on our hands here 
phil  would you repeat
to mr  melon   
the allegations
that you ve made to me 
it s clear the work you ve
handed in is not your own 
i m accusing you
of academic fraud 
fraud is such an ugly word   
considering
the financial generosity   
that mr  melon has shown
towards our fine university 
i think mr  melon
should be expelled 
what are you going
to do about it 
well  thornton   
i m only going
to ask you this one time 
is the work that
you turned in your own 
i can t lie to you 
dean martin

i m satisfied 
  phil 
  i m outraged 
gee whiz  phil

and he said yes

torture him 
i suggest a comprehensive
oral examination   
conducted by all of
mr  melon s professors 
oral examination
