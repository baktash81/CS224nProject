for some gentlemen the only way
to achieve the impossible
is to believe it is possible
that kind of thinking could ruin you
im willing to take that chance
imagine trading posts
in rangoon bangkok jakarta
the nightmare again
i wont be long
im falling down a dark hole
then i see strange creatures
what kind of creatures
well theres a dodo bird
a rabbit in a waistcoat a smiling cat
i didnt know cats could smile
sighing neither did i
and theres a blue caterpillar
blue caterpillar
hmm
do you think ive gone round the bend
im afraid so
youre mad bonkers off your head
but ill tell you a secret
all the best people are
laughing
its only a dream alice
nothing can harm you there
but if you get too frightened
you can always wake up like this
laughing ow
sighing
must we go
doubt theyll notice if we never arrive
they will notice
wheres your corset
and no stockings
im against them
but youre not properly dressed
whos to say what is proper
what if it was agreed that proper
was wearing a codfish on your head
would you wear it
alice
to me a corset is like a codfish
please not today
father would have laughed
im sorry im tired
i didnt sleep well last night
did you have bad dreams again
only one
its always the same
ever since i can remember
do you think thats normal
dont most people
have different dreams
i dont know
there youre beautiful
now can you manage a smile
classical music playing
at last we thought youd never arrive
alice hamish is waiting
to dance with you go
you do realize its well past 400
now everything will have
to be rushed through
i am sorry
oh never mind
forgive my wife shes been planning
this affair for over 20 years
if only charles were here
my condolences
i think of your husband often
he was truly a man of vision
i hope you dont think ive taken
advantage of your misfortunes
of course not im pleased
that you purchased the company
i was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when i had the chance
charles thought so too
classical music
continues playing
hamish do you ever tire of quadrille
on the contrary i find it invigorating
laughs
do i amuse you
no
i had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers
and the men wearing dresses
i think youll do best
to keep your visions to yourself
when in doubt remain silent
geese honking
gasps
pardon us sir
miss kingsleigh is distracted today
wheres your head
i was wondering
what it would be like to fly
why would you spend your time
thinking about
such an impossible thing
why wouldnt i
my father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things
before breakfast
softly come along
alice meet me under the gazebo
in precisely 10 minutes
faith exhaling excitedly
we have a secret to tell you
if youre telling me
then its not much of a secret
perhaps we shouldnt
we decided we should
if we tell her she wont be surprised
will you be surprised
not if you tell me
but now youve brought it up
you have to
no we dont
in fact we wont
i wonder if your mother knows
that you two swim naked
in the havershims pond
you wouldnt
oh but i would
theres your mother right now
hamish is going to ask for your hand
youve ruined the surprise
i could strangle them
everyone went to so much effort
to keep the secret
does everyone know
its why theyve all come
this is your engagement party
hamish will ask you under the gazebo
when you say yes
but i dont know
if i want to marry hamish
who then
you wont do better than a lord
youll soon be 20 alice
that pretty face wont last forever
you dont want to end up
like aunt imogene
and you dont want to be a burden
on mother do you
no
so youll marry hamish
you will be as happy
as i am with lowell
and your life will be perfect
its already decided
alice dear
ill leave you to it
shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden just you and me
do you know what ive always dreaded
the decline of the aristocracy
ugly grandchildren but youre lovely
youre bound to produce
little imbeciles
the gardeners have
planted white roses
when i specifically asked for red
you could always paint the roses red
what an odd thing to say
you should know that my son
has extremely delicate digestion
rustling
did you see that
see what
it was a rabbit i think
nasty things
i do enjoy setting the dogs on them
if you serve hamish the wrong foods
he could get a blockage
rustling
did you see it that time
see what
the rabbit
dont shout
now pay attention
hamish said you were easily distracted
what was i saying
hamish has a blockage
i couldnt be more interested
but youll have to excuse me
aunt imogene
i think im going mad
i keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat
i cant be bothered
with your fancy rabbit now
im waiting for my fiancé
you have a fiancé
hmm
rustling
there did you see it
hes a prince
but alas he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne
its tragic isnt it
very
lowell
alice we were just
hatties an old friend
i can see youre very close
look you wont mention this
to your sister will you
i dont know im confused
i need time to think
well think about margaret

on your shoulder

my sister preferred to study
dominion over living things
sizzling
tell me how does she seem to you
perfectly horrid
and her head
bulbous
i think she may have
some kind of growth in there
something pressing on her brain
three coins from a dead mans pocket
two teaspoons of wishful thinking
you cant imagine the things
that go on in that place
oh yes i can
but when a champion steps forth
to slay the jabberwocky
the people will rise against her
spitting
that should do it
blow
feel better
much thank you
theres someone here
who would like to speak with you
absolem
who are you
coughing
i thought wed settled this
im alice but not that one
how do you know
you said so yourself
i said you were not hardly alice
but youre much more her now
in fact youre almost alice
even so
i couldnt slay the jabberwocky
if my life depended on it
it will
so i suggest
you keep the vorpal sword on hand
when the frabjous day arrives
you seem so real
sometimes i forget
that this is all a dream
coughing
will you stop doing that
laughing
whooshing
ive always admired that hat

frabjous day how could i forget

youre just a figment of my imagination
i would dream up someone
whos halfmad

halfmad to dream me up
laughs

ill miss you when i wake up
playing trumpet

i should be the one
ill do it
no me
no me
no other slayer nohow
if it aint alice it aint dead
alice you cannot live your life
to please others
the choice must be yours
because when you step out
to face that creature
you will step out alone

all you have to do is hold on to it
fairfarren alice
perhaps i will see you in another life
heavy footsteps approaching
hello iracebeth
hello mirana
playing trumpet
on this the frabjous day
the queens red and white
shall send forth their champions
to do battle on their behalf
oh racie we dont have to fight
i know what youre doing
you think you can blink
those pretty little eyes
and ill melt
just like mummy and daddy did
please
no it is my crown i am the eldest
jabberwocky
whimpering
gasping
roaring
this is impossible
only if you believe it is
sometimes i believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast
that is an excellent practice
however just at the moment
you really might want
to focus on the jabberwocky
wheres your champion sister
here
hello um
six impossible things
count them alice
one theres a potion
that can make you shrink
roars
two and a cake
that can make you grow
so my old foe
we meet on the battlefield once again
weve never met
not you insignificant bearer
my ancient enemy the vorpal one
thats enough chatter
jabberwocky shrieking
three animals can talk
four alice
cats can disappear
five
theres a place called wonderland
six
i can slay the jabberwocky
roars
the hatters interfering
off with his head
screeching
bandersnatch roaring
jabberwocky screeching
off with your head
kill her
we follow you no more
bloody big head
how dare you off with his head
iracebeth of crims your crimes
against underland are worthy of death
however that is against my vows
therefore you are banished
to the outlands
no one is to show you any kindness
or ever speak a word to you
you will not have a friend in the world
majesty i hope you bear me no ill will
only this one ilosovic stayne
you are to join iracebeth in banishment
from this day
until the end of underland
at least we have each other
gasps
exclaiming

but i do not owe you a kindness
stayne take off my head
he tried to kill me
majesty please please
he tried to kill me
i offer you my head
he tried to kill me
oh the frabjous day callou callay
futterwacken music playing

futterwacken
laughing
laughs
clears throat
blood of the jabberwocky
you have our everlasting gratitude
and for your efforts on our behalf
will this take me home
lf that is what you choose
you could stay
what an idea
a crazy mad wonderful idea
but i cant
there are questions i have to answer
things i have to do
be back again before you know it
you wont remember me
of course i will how could i forget
hatter why is a raven
like a writing desk
i havent the slightest idea
fairfarren alice
people chattering
she left me standing there
without an answer
a case of nerves no doubt
alice
lord ascot good lord
are you all right
what happened to you
i fell down a hole and hit my head
im sorry hamish i cant marry you
youre not the right man for me
and theres that trouble
with your digestion
i love you margaret but this is my life
ill decide what to do with it
youre lucky to have my sister
for your wife lowell
and you be good to her
ill be watching very closely
there is no prince aunt imogene
you need to talk to someone
about these delusions
i happen to love rabbits
especially white ones
dont worry mother
ill find something useful
to do with my life
you two remind me of some funny boys
i met in a dream
youve left me out
no i havent sir
you and i have business to discuss
shall we speak in the study
oh and one more thing
all gasping
my father told me he planned to expand
his trade route to sumatra and borneo
but i dont think
he was looking far enough
why not go all the way to china
its vast the culture is rich
and we have a foothold in hong kong
to be the first to trade with china
can you imagine it
you know if anybody else
had said that to me
id say youve lost your senses
but ive seen that look before
well as youre not going to be
my daughterinlaw
perhaps youd consider becoming
an apprentice with the company
hello absolem
alice playing
tripping out spinning around
im underground
i fell down
yeah i fell down
im freaking out
where am i now
upside down and i cant stop it now

when the worlds crashing down
when i fall and hit the ground
i will turn myself around

when the worlds crashing down
when i fall and hit the ground
i will turn myself around

alices theme playing
oh alice dear where have you been
so near so far so in between
what have you heard
what have you seen
alice alice please alice
oh tell us are you big or small
to try this one or try them all
its such a long long way to fall
alice alice oh alice
how can you know this way not that
you choose the door
you choose the path
perhaps you should be coming back
another day another day
and nothing is quite what it seems
youre dreaming
are you dreaming
oh alice
oh
oh how will you find your way
no time for tears today
no time for tears today
so many doors how did you choose
so much to gain so much to lose
so many things got in your way
no time today no time today
be careful not to lose your head
remember what the dormouse said
alice
