for some  gentlemen  the only way
to achieve the impossible
is to believe it is possible 
that kind of thinking could ruin you 
i m willing to take that chance 
imagine trading posts
in rangoon  bangkok  jakarta   
the nightmare again 
i won t be long 
i m falling down a dark hole 
then i see strange creatures 
what kind of creatures 
well  there s a dodo bird 
a rabbit in a waistcoat  a smiling cat 
i didn t know cats could smile 
 sighing  neither did i 
and there s a blue caterpillar 
blue caterpillar 
hmm 
do you think i ve gone round the bend 
i m afraid so 
you re mad  bonkers  off your head 
but i ll tell you a secret 
all the best people are 
 laughing 
it s only a dream  alice 
nothing can harm you there 
but if you get too frightened 
you can always wake up  like this 
 laughing  ow 
 sighing 
must we go 
doubt they ll notice if we never arrive 
they will notice 
where s your corset 
and no stockings 
i m against them 
but you re not properly dressed 
who s to say what is proper 
what if it was agreed that  proper 
was wearing a codfish on your head 
  would you wear it 
  alice 
to me  a corset is like a codfish 
please  not today 
father would have laughed 
i m sorry  i m tired 
i didn t sleep well last night 
did you have bad dreams again 
only one 
it s always the same 
ever since i can remember 
do you think that s normal 
don t most people
have different dreams 
i don t know 
there  you re beautiful 
now  can you manage a smile 
 classical music playing 
at last  we thought you d never arrive 
alice  hamish is waiting
to dance with you  go 
you do realize it s well past 4 00 
now everything will have
to be rushed through 
  i am sorry 
  oh  never mind 
forgive my wife  she s been planning
this affair for over 20 years 
if only charles were here   
my condolences 
i think of your husband often 
he was truly a man of vision 
i hope you don t think i ve taken
advantage of your misfortunes 
of course not  i m pleased
that you purchased the company 
i was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when i had the chance 
charles thought so  too 
 classical music
continues playing 
hamish  do you ever tire of quadrille 
on the contrary  i find it invigorating 
 laughs 
do i amuse you 
no 
i had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers
and the men wearing dresses 
i think you ll do best
to keep your visions to yourself 
when in doubt  remain silent 
 geese honking 
 gasps 
pardon us  sir 
miss kingsleigh is distracted today 
where s your head 
i was wondering
what it would be like to fly 
why would you spend your time
thinking about
such an impossible thing 
why wouldn t i 
my father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things
before breakfast 
 softly  come along 
alice  meet me under the gazebo
in precisely 10 minutes 
 faith exhaling excitedly 
we have a secret to tell you 
if you re telling me 
then it s not much of a secret 
  perhaps we shouldn t 
  we decided we should 
if we tell her  she won t be surprised 
  will you be surprised 
  not if you tell me 
but now you ve brought it up 
you have to 
  no  we don t 
  in fact  we won t 
i wonder if your mother knows
that you two swim naked
in the havershims  pond 
  you wouldn t 
  oh  but i would 
there s your mother right now 
hamish is going to ask for your hand 
you ve ruined the surprise 
i could strangle them 
everyone went to so much effort
to keep the secret 
does everyone know 
it s why they ve all come 
this is your engagement party 
hamish will ask you under the gazebo 
when you say yes   
but i don t know
if i want to marry hamish 
who  then 
you won t do better than a lord 
you ll soon be 20  alice 
that pretty face won t last forever 
you don t want to end up
like aunt imogene 
and you don t want to be a burden
on mother  do you 
no 
so you ll marry hamish 
you will be as happy
as i am with lowell 
and your life will be perfect 
it s already decided 
alice  dear 
i ll leave you to it 
shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden  just you and me 
do you know what i ve always dreaded 
the decline of the aristocracy 
ugly grandchildren  but you re lovely 
you re bound to produce
little    imbeciles 
the gardeners have
planted white roses
when i specifically asked for red 
you could always paint the roses red 
what an odd thing to say 
you should know that my son
has extremely delicate digestion 
 rustling 
  did you see that 
  see what 
  it was a rabbit  i think 
  nasty things 
i do enjoy setting the dogs on them 
if you serve hamish the wrong foods 
he could get a blockage 
 rustling 
did you see it that time 
  see what 
  the rabbit 
don t shout 
now  pay attention 
hamish said you were easily distracted 
  what was i saying 
  hamish has a blockage 
i couldn t be more interested 
but you ll have to excuse me 
aunt imogene 
i think i m going mad 
i keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat 
i can t be bothered
with your fancy rabbit now 
i m waiting for my fiancé 
  you have a fiancé 
  hmm 
 rustling 
there  did you see it 
he s a prince 
but  alas  he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne 
it s tragic  isn t it 
very 
lowell 
alice  we were just   
hattie s an old friend 
i can see you re very close 
look  you won t mention this
to your sister  will you 
i don t know  i m confused 
i need time to think 
well  think about margaret 
she d never trust me again 
you don t want to ruin her marriage 
do you 
me 
but i m not the one who s
sneaking around behind her back 
there you are 
alice kingsleigh   
hamish 
what is it 
you have a caterpillar
on your shoulder 
ew 
don t hurt it 
you ll want to wash that finger 
alice kingsleigh 
will you be my wife 
well 
everyone expects me to 
and you re a lord 
my face won t last 
and i don t want to end up like   
but this is happening so quickly  i   
i think i   
 watch ticking 
i think i   
i need a moment 
 watch ticking

um forced herself on me 
i told her my heart belongs to you 
but she s obsessed with me 
off with her head 
stand back  mallymkun 
how s this for muchness 
no  no

  i m not leaving without you 
go 
run  alice

alice 
of course  why didn t i see it 
well  it has been a long time 
and you were such a little tyke then 
  give me the sword 
  stay back 
the queen will be so pleased 
she will take great pleasure
in taking off your head 
 bandersnatch roaring 
  oh  alice 
  bayard  to marmoreal 
 barking 
 roaring 
majesty  alice has escaped
on the bandersnatch 
with the vorpal sword 
how could you let this happen 
i may have underestimated her 
but we have her conspirators 
the hatter and a dormouse 
off with their heads 
white queen 
welcome to marmoreal 
i believe this belongs to you 
mmm 
the vorpal sword is home again 
the armor is complete 
now all we need is a champion 
you re a little taller
than i thought you d be 
blame it on too much upelkuchen 
oh 
come with me 
is the march hare here 
 exclaiming  you re late
for your soup  you wee besom 
  you re late for your soup 
  could use some salt 
come here  you 
give me that here 
choppy  chop  chop  chop 
leek and potato  yes  that would be   
 sighing 
pishsalver  let me think 
a pinch of worm fat 
urine of the horsefly 
buttered fingers 
my sister preferred to study
dominion over living things 
 sizzling 
tell me  how does she seem to you 
perfectly horrid 
  and her head 
  bulbous 
i think she may have
some kind of growth in there 
something pressing on her brain 
three coins from a dead man s pocket 
two teaspoons of wishful thinking 
you can t imagine the things
that go on in that place 
oh  yes  i can 
but when a champion steps forth
to slay the jabberwocky 
the people will rise against her 
 spitting 
that should do it 
blow 
  feel better 
  much  thank you 
there s someone here
who would like to speak with you 
  absolem 
  who are you 
 coughing 
i thought we d settled this 
i m alice  but not that one 
  how do you know 
  you said so yourself 
i said you were not hardly alice 
but you re much more her now 
in fact  you re almost alice 
even so 
i couldn t slay the jabberwocky
if my life depended on it 
it will 
so i suggest
you keep the vorpal sword on hand
when the frabjous day arrives 
you seem so real 
sometimes i forget
that this is all a dream 
 coughing 
will you stop doing that 
 laughing 
 whooshing 
i ve always admired that hat 
hello  chess 
since you won t be needing it
anymore 
would you consider
bequeathing it to me 
how dare you 
it is a formal execution 
i would like to look my best  you know 
it is a pity about all this 
i was looking forward
to seeing you futterwacken 
i was rather good at it  was i not 
i really do love that hat 
i would wear it
to all the finest occasions 
i love a morning execution  don t you 
  yes  your majesty 
  yes  your majesty 
  i d like to keep it on 
  suit yourself 
as long as i can get at your neck 
i m right behind you 
off with his head 
i can t watch 
 executioner shouting 
good morning  everyone 
chess  you dog 
   gasps 
  madam 
you are being heinously bamboozled
by these lickspittle toadies
you surround yourselves with 
 laughing 
what is that 
i m not the only one  majesty  look 
a counterfeit nose 
you should be ashamed 
me  what about that big belly
you re so proud of 
 gasps 
liars  cheats  falsifiers 
off with their heads 
the abused and enslaved
in the red queen s court 
all of you stand up and fight 
rise up against the bloody red queen 
  downal wyth bluddy behg hid 
  all  downal wyth bluddy behg hid 
 all cheering 
release the jubjub bird 
 all gasping 
 screeching 
 people screaming

come  boys  quickly  come on 
hatter 
come on  mally  quickly 
come on  come on 
prepare the jabberwocky for battle 
we re going to visit my little sister 
i had hoped
to have a champion by now 
why don t you slay
the jabberwocky yourself 
you must have the power 
it is against my vows
to harm any living creature 
 sputtering 
we have company 
have a look  bayard 
bayard  bielle 
 barking 
i m so happy to see you 
i thought they were going to   
so did i  but they didn t 
and now here i am  still in one piece 
and i m rather glad about that
now that i m seeing you again 
i would have regretted
not seeing you again 
especially now that you re you 
and the proper size 
and it s a good size  it s a great size 
it s a right proper alice size 
  hatter 
  size  fez  i m fine 
where s your hat 
mmm 
  cheshire 
  how s the arm  love 
all healed 
goodbye  sweet hat 
have you any idea
why a raven is like a writing desk 
let me think about it 
you know what tomorrow is  don t you 
frabjous day  how could i forget 
wish i d wake up 
  still believe this is a dream  do you 
  of course 
this has all come from my own mind 
which would mean that i m not real 
afraid so 
you re just a figment of my imagination 
i would dream up someone
who s half mad 
yes  yes  but you would have to be
half mad to dream me up 
 laughs 
i must be  then 
i ll miss you when i wake up 
 playing trumpet 
who will step forth to be champion
for the white queen 
that would be i 
you have very poor evaporating skills 
i should be the one 
i ll do it 
  no  me 
  no  me 
no other slayer  nohow 
if it ain t alice  it ain t dead 
alice  you cannot live your life
to please others 
the choice must be yours 
because when you step out
to face that creature 
you will step out alone 
nothing was ever accomplished
with tears 
absolem 
why are you upside down 
i ve come to the end of this life 
  you re going to die 
  transform 
don t go  i need your help 
i don t know what to do 
i can t help you if you don t even know
who you are  stupid girl 
i m not stupid 
my name is alice  i live in london 
i have a mother named helen
and a sister named margaret 
my father was charles kingsleigh 
he had a vision that stretched
halfway around the world 
and nothing ever stopped him 
i m his daughter  i m alice kingsleigh 
alice  at last 
you were just as dim witted
the first time you were here 
you called it  wonderland   as i recall 
wonderland 
 watch ticking 
  what do you call yourself 
  alice 
the alice 
then i ll take you to the hare
and the hatter  but that s the end of it 
mctwisp  she s the right one 
i m certain of it 
ah  thackery  not at the table  please

you re not absolem 
i m absolem  stupid girl 
 coughing 
  what is this 
  i m tweedledee  he s tweedledum 
contrariwise  i m tweedledum 
he s tweedledee 
dodo  you d think she would
remember all this from the first time 
curiouser and curiouser 
it wasn t a dream at all 
it was a memory 
this place is real 
and so are you and so is the hatter 
and the jabberwocky 
remember  the vorpal sword
knows what it wants 
all you have to do is hold on to it 
fairfarren  alice 
perhaps i will see you in another life 
 heavy footsteps approaching 
  hello  iracebeth 
  hello  mirana 
 playing trumpet 
on this  the frabjous day 
the queens red and white
shall send forth their champions
to do battle on their behalf 
oh  racie  we don t have to fight 
i know what you re doing 
you think you can blink
those pretty little eyes
and i ll melt 
just like mummy and daddy did 
please 
no  it is my crown  i am the eldest 
jabberwocky 
 whimpering 
 gasping 
 roaring 
this is impossible 
only if you believe it is 
sometimes i believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast 
that is an excellent practice 
however  just at the moment 
you really might want
to focus on the jabberwocky 
where s your champion  sister 
here 
hello  um 
six impossible things 
count them  alice 
one  there s a potion
that can make you shrink 
 roars 
two  and a cake
that can make you grow 
so  my old foe 
we meet on the battlefield once again 
we ve never met 
not you  insignificant bearer 
my ancient enemy  the vorpal one 
that s enough chatter 
 jabberwocky shrieking 
three  animals can talk 
four  alice 
cats can disappear 
five 
there s a place called wonderland 
six 
i can slay the jabberwocky 
 roars 
the hatter s interfering 
off with his head 
 screeching 
 bandersnatch roaring 
 jabberwocky screeching 
off with your head 
kill her 
we follow you no more 
bloody big head 
how dare you  off with his head 
iracebeth of crims  your crimes
against underland are worthy of death 
however  that is against my vows 
therefore  you are banished
to the outlands 
no one is to show you any kindness 
or ever speak a word to you 
you will not have a friend in the world 
majesty  i hope you bear me no ill will 
only this one  ilosovic stayne 
you are to join iracebeth in banishment
from this day
until the end of underland 
at least we have each other 
 gasps 
 exclaiming 
majesty  please  kill me  please 
but i do not owe you a kindness 
  stayne  take off my head 
  he tried to kill me 
  majesty  please  please 
  he tried to kill me 
  i offer you my head 
  he tried to kill me 
oh  the frabjous day  callou  callay 
 futterwacken music playing 
  what is he doing 
  futterwacken 
 laughing 
 laughs 
 clears throat 
blood of the jabberwocky 
you have our everlasting gratitude 
and for your efforts on our behalf   
  will this take me home 
  lf that is what you choose 
you could stay 
what an idea 
a crazy  mad  wonderful idea 
but i can t 
there are questions i have to answer 
things i have to do 
be back again before you know it 
you won t remember me 
of course i will  how could i forget 
hatter  why is a raven
like a writing desk 
i haven t the slightest idea 
fairfarren  alice 
 people chattering 
she left me standing there
without an answer 
a case of nerves  no doubt 
  alice 
  lord ascot  good lord 
  are you all right 
  what happened to you 
i fell down a hole and hit my head 
i m sorry  hamish  i can t marry you 
you re not the right man for me 
and there s that trouble
with your digestion 
i love you  margaret  but this is my life 
i ll decide what to do with it 
you re lucky to have my sister
for your wife  lowell 
and you be good to her 
i ll be watching very closely 
there is no prince  aunt imogene 
you need to talk to someone
about these delusions 
i happen to love rabbits 
especially white ones 
don t worry  mother 
i ll find something useful
to do with my life 
you two remind me of some funny boys
i met in a dream 
  you ve left me out 
  no  i haven t  sir 
you and i have business to discuss 
shall we speak in the study 
oh  and one more thing 
 all gasping 
my father told me he planned to expand
his trade route to sumatra and borneo 
but i don t think
he was looking far enough 
why not go all the way to china 
it s vast  the culture is rich 
and we have a foothold in hong kong 
to be the first to trade with china 
can you imagine it 
you know  if anybody else
had said that to me 
i d say   you ve lost your senses  
but i ve seen that look before 
well  as you re not going to be
my daughter in law 
perhaps you d consider becoming
an apprentice with the company 
hello  absolem 
 alice playing 
tripping out  spinning around
i m underground
i fell down
yeah  i fell down
i m freaking out
where am i now 
upside down and i can t stop it now
can t stop me now
i  i ll get by
i  i ll survive
when the world s crashing down
when i fall and hit the ground
i will turn myself around
don t you try to stop me
i  i won t cry
i found myself in wonderland
get back on my feet  the ground
is this real 
is it pretend 
i ll take a stand until the end
i  i ll get by
i  i ll survive
when the world s crashing down
when i fall and hit the ground
i will turn myself around
don t you try to stop me
i  i won t cry
 alice s theme playing 
oh  alice  dear  where have you been 
so near  so far  so in between
what have you heard 
what have you seen 
alice  alice  please  alice
oh  tell us  are you big or small 
to try this one or try them all
it s such a long  long way to fall
alice  alice  oh  alice
how can you know this way  not that 
you choose the door
you choose the path
perhaps you should be coming back
another day  another day
and nothing is quite what it seems
you re dreaming
are you dreaming 
oh  alice
oh 
oh  how will you find your way 
no time for tears today
no time for tears today
so many doors  how did you choose 
so much to gain  so much to lose
so many things got in your way
no time today  no time today
be careful not to lose your head
remember what the dormouse said
alice
