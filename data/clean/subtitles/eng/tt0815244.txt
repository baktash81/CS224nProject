she wouldnt know
her gucci from her pucci

all over tyler before she came in the house
it was embarrassing trust me
we do not want a kappa who behaves that way

shes a legacy
her mom gets her the bid
but she has to survive pledging all on her own
oh my gosh i saw him outside

some of us didnt get along with our roommates
some of us made others feel uncomfortable
some of us wet the bed
some of us wet the hallway
uh all of us are outsiders
yeah i know what thats like

youre a kappa pledge
by definition very much an insider
would all the kappa pledges

in the girls bathroom
another pledge ritual
oh
oh oh
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
ok
ill meet you there
door opens
sydney
both scream
pervert
ow
looks like you
get stuck with the check
we live in a country thats considered to be
the ultimate model of government
by the people
for the people and of the people
but most americans would be surprised to find
how afraid the founding fathers were
of what a direct democracy could do to the country
can anyone tell me why
snoring
snores
the young man snoring there perhaps
chuckling
coughs
the founding fathers were afraid
that direct democracy
would do to america
what it did to rome
alexander hamilton
even advocated a monarchy snores
exactly
we are trained to think
the more power the people have the better
can any of you tell me
some reasons why this isnt necessarily true
ah terrence
still here after eight years
what do you say we give someone else
a chance to respond this time huh
um ms witch burn
most americans
dont educate themselves about the issues
there are some valid arguments
for keeping things a little bit more elite
you could even argue a case
for certain types of oligarchy
interesting
lets hear from someone else
how about you
ms
white
ms white
any thoughts
um
i guess i think thats
underestimating the masses a bit
not to mention
overestimating the elites
apartheid was an oligarchy
and no one wants that again
excellent
alicia what year
was kappa phi nu founded
very good
mm
want some breakfast
yeah
help yourself
breakfast is good
rachel ugh
its called moisturizer

a normal amount of time in the bathroom
sydney its time to get back to the house
ok
dont ask
we had to take her
i think shes cool
and cute
just admit theyre cooler
you dont know
what the hell youre talking about
there is no way that a pirate
is cooler than a ninja
ninjas live like monks
pirates get booty end of discussion
hi i need to return these
and i have a couple of poli sci books on reserve
im impressed
i dont get a lot of pledges in here studying
well they probably dont
have scholarships to maintain
you and your drunken whoring pirates
represent the lowest common denominator in society
chuckles all right
i think we can all agree that
a pirateninja would be the coolest thing ever
hi
oh hi
hello
i wanted to apologize
for what i did to you in the bathroom
what did she do to you in the bathroom
what did she do
it was a stupid pledge prank
and im really really sorry
hey it wasnt exactly
surprising behavior for a kappa
come on uh lets go
excuse me
if it makes you feel any better they threw baloney
at us while we sang céline dion songs
laughter

ladies and gentlemen
im afraid we have a bit of a situation
every so often it is the unfortunate duty
of the president to act as judge and jury
sydney white has exhibited
inappropriate kappa behavior
audience gasps
is this a pledge prank
it certainly is not
you are guilty of the following infractions
you brought an unsuitable date
to the date dash
cheated during a pledge quiz
revealed a secret pledge ritual
to the entire library
and finally lied about your background
we all know your dad
is actually a plumber
as kappa president
according to statute 25a of the sorority charter
i hereby dismiss sydney white
from the kappa pledge class
i dont know what your mother got away with
when she was here
but you will never be a kappa
you know what
thank you
because if this is what sisterhoods all about
then i dont want any part of it
i want that dress back
take it
all gasp
thunderclaps
i will see your cobra commander

thanks for putting on a show guys
this is low even for you rachel
aw sydney so nice of you
to care about them
since youre the mastermind behind
their adorable little student council campaign
let me be the first to break the news
terrence is disqualified
from running for president
what are you talking about
terrence lubinecki is not a student
at southern atlantic
he graduated six years ago
i had to stay there was
just so much more learning to do
terrence maybe you should
put on some clothes ok
rachel why dont you get the hell outta here
ooh i love it when you get rough
and ty thanks for playing your part so well
thats the other good news
the witch burnprince greek life center
is now a reality
witch burnprince what the hell
you didnt tell her
i thought you guys were so close
its a little joint project of ours
and the only thing standing in our way
was the vortex
so like you suggested tyler
i went ahead
and had it condemned
now you can eat
with the homeless every night
you had something
to do with this
no i mean i said the place
was a dump but i didnt
witch burnprince huh
so you wanted to tear down the vortex
yeah i did but
i dont wanna hear it
sydney
no
dont grovel tyler
youre above it
things are looking grim
brothers
i am so sorry about this
you guys
you shouldve just left us alone
we were fine until you came along
and made us your guinea pigs
you guys its so important
for us to stand up to the greeks
and show them that
they cant trample all over us
well its also important for us
to have a place to live
phone rings
hello
dad
laughs got you youve reached royal plumbing
at the white house no not that one
this is paul and sydneys leave a message
beep
hi dad i was just calling
to say i miss you
and thats it um
everythings great here really great
i love you
it was that message last night i could tell something
wasnt right i could hear it in your voice
so i got in the van
and i drove all through the night
i was a little surprised to find
you werent at the kappa house though
i wanted to tell you
so many times but
i kept thinking about mom
and i felt like id failed her
and you always sounded
so proud of me on the phone
sweetheart following in your mothers footsteps
is not about reliving her life
its about being
the same kind of person she was
hey
your mom was much more
than just a kappa
she was a woman who always fought
for what she believed in and so are you
nothing could make me
prouder than that
not even when i installed
that water filtration system in under an hour
that was pretty great
laughs
knock at door
grunts
but it says do not disturb
knocking continues
up and at em guys
its time to make some plans
i know youre still pissed at me but come on
are you gonna wallow here in this fleabag motel
because some prissy girlygirl who probably
doesnt know who gandalf is screwed us over
youre right
i bet she doesnt know who gandalf is
laughter
were still mad at you though
thats ok i want you to be mad
i want you to get fired up
so we can win this election
because the freedom to the 7th power
party will prevail
yeah
with our new candidate for president
me im gonna run against rachel
and were gonna take her down
stand up by mêlée
im sydney white
and im running for student council president
im sydney white and im running for student council
president on the freedom to the 7th power ticket
your papers count for three quarters of
your final grade and no late papers will be accepted
as youre writing these papers i want you to think
about the mechanics of modern campaigning
you may be wondering why you should even care
why bother voting
the greeks win every year
and its one more way they run the school
theres a whole lot of talk today
about the need to cater to your base
but theres something to be said
for thinking outside of that box
sydney freedom to the 7th power
whoohoo
freedom to the 7th power
man good job
groans
the fact is that 80 of the student body
at southern atlantic is not greek 80
take the kennedy campaign in 1960
he was inherently an outsider
a catholic had never been elected as president
who reached out to other outsiders
students chant in hebrew
lchaim
lchaim
sydney to those students i say
its time for you to be heard
carlton minorities women the poor
the disenfranchised won
that election for john kennedy
naked pain
an epic poem in 12 parts
its time for you to be heard
and we are here to listen
cheering
chanting in hebrew
its a lesson worth remembering
whoohoo
cheering
rachel here you go
dont vote for sydney white
lets keep it greek all right
does this look like your next president

crowd boos
its time for the rest of the school
to take back the school
yeah
i bet most of you have no idea how great
the campus a cappella group is and why would you
the social and cultural landscape

in a dank basement thats hard on their vocal cords

i have met so many great
and interesting people here
