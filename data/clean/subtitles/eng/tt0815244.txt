that girl is not kappa material 
 christy  really 
i didn t see anything wrong with her 
christy  you know you re not
as perceptive as i am 
she wouldn t know
her gucci from her pucci 
not to mention  i saw her throwing herself
all over tyler before she came in the house 
it was embarrassing  trust me 
we do not want a kappa who behaves that way 
see what i mean 
but we have to give her a bid 
she s a legacy 
her mom gets her the bid 
but she has to survive pledging all on her own 
oh  my gosh  i saw him outside 
and he is definitely the hottest guy on campus 
who s the hottest guy on campus 
tyler prince 
the beta president

so  tell me about the vortex 
what s it like 
uh   
i guess you d call it a  uh    haven 
uh  for people who don t have anywhere else to go 
some of us didn t get along with our roommates 
some of us made others feel uncomfortable 
some of us wet the bed 
some of us wet the hallway 
uh  all of us are outsiders 
yeah  i know what that s like 
uh  are you serious 
you re a kappa pledge

i cannot just ditch him 
i don t make the rules  sydney 
if being a kappa is important to you 
then this is the price you pay 
hey   date

another pledge ritual 
oh 
oh  oh 
yeah 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
ok 
i ll meet you there 
 door opens 
sydney 
 both scream 
pervert 
ow 
looks like you
get stuck with the check 
we live in a country that s considered to be
the ultimate model of government 
by the people 
for the people  and of the people 
but most americans would be surprised to find
how afraid the founding fathers were
of what a direct democracy could do to the country 
can anyone tell me why 
 snoring 
 snores 
the young man snoring there  perhaps 
 chuckling 
 coughs 
the founding fathers were afraid
that direct democracy
would do to america
what it did to rome 
alexander hamilton
even advocated a monarchy   snores 
exactly 
we are trained to think
the more power the people have  the better 
can any of you tell me
some reasons why this isn t necessarily true 
ah  terrence 
still here after eight years 
what do you say we give someone else
a chance to respond this time  huh 
um    ms  witch burn 
most americans
don t educate themselves about the issues 
there are some valid arguments
for keeping things a little bit more    elite 
you could even argue a case
for certain types of oligarchy 
interesting 
let s hear from someone else 
how about    you 
ms 
white 
ms  white 
any thoughts 
um   
i guess i think that s   
underestimating the masses a bit 
not to mention
overestimating the elites 
apartheid was an oligarchy 
and no one wants that again 
excellent 
alicia  what year
was kappa phi nu founded 
1902 
very good 
mm 
want some breakfast 
yeah 
help yourself 
breakfast is good 
 rachel  ugh

oh

hi 
sorry you had to do that 
some of the girls are a little traumatized 
 sydney 
yeah  it s ok  i  uh   
i spend a lot of time in bathrooms 
no  no  i don t mean like that 
i just mean that  um   
i don t go to the bathroom a lot  i

just to be clear  i spend
a normal amount of time in the bathroom 
sydney  it s time to get back to the house 
ok 
don t ask 
we had to take her 
i think she s cool 
and cute 
just admit they re cooler 
you don t know
what the hell you re talking about 
there is no way that a pirate
is cooler than a ninja 
ninja s live like monks 
pirates get booty  end of discussion 
hi  i need to return these
and i have a couple of poli sci books on reserve 
i m impressed 
i don t get a lot of pledges in here studying 
well  they probably don t
have scholarships to maintain 
you and your drunken  whoring pirates
represent the lowest common denominator in society 
 chuckles  all right 
i think we can all agree that
a pirate ninja would be the coolest thing ever 
hi 
oh  hi 
hello 
i wanted to apologize
for what i did to you in the bathroom 
what did she do to you in the bathroom 
what did she do 
it was a stupid pledge prank
and i m really  really sorry 
hey  it wasn t exactly
surprising behavior for a kappa 
come on  uh  let s go 
excuse me 
if it makes you feel any better  they threw baloney
at us while we sang céline dion songs 
 laughter 
girls  it s been along journey 
but you re almost done

ladies and gentlemen 
i m afraid we have a bit of a situation 
every so often  it is the unfortunate duty
of the president to act as judge and jury 
sydney white has exhibited
inappropriate kappa behavior 
 audience gasps 
is this a pledge prank 
it certainly is not 
you are guilty of the following infractions 
you brought an unsuitable date
to the date dash 
cheated during a pledge quiz 
revealed a secret pledge ritual
to the entire library 
and  finally  lied about your background 
we all know your dad
is actually a plumber 
as kappa president 
according to statute 25a of the sorority charter 
i hereby dismiss sydney white
from the kappa pledge class 
i don t know what your mother got away with
when she was here 
but you will never be a kappa 
you know what 
thank you 
because if this is what sisterhood s all about 
then i don t want any part of it 
i want that dress back

thanks for putting on a show  guys 
this is low  even for you  rachel 
aw  sydney  so nice of you
to care about them 
since you re the mastermind behind
their adorable little student council campaign 
let me be the first to break the news 
terrence is disqualified
from running for president 
what are you talking about 
terrence lubinecki is not a student
at southern atlantic 
he graduated six years ago 
i had to stay  there was
just so much more learning to do 
terrence  maybe you should
put on some clothes  ok 
rachel  why don t you get the hell outta here 
ooh  i love it when you get rough 
and  ty  thanks for playing your part so well 
that s the other good news 
the witch burn prince greek life center
is now a reality 
witch burn prince  what the hell 
you didn t tell her 
i thought you guys were so close 
it s a little joint project of ours
and the only thing standing in our way
was the vortex 
so  like you suggested  tyler 
i went ahead
and had it condemned 
now you can eat
with the homeless every night 
you had something
to do with this 
no  i mean  i said the place
was a dump  but i didn t   
witch burn prince  huh 
so you wanted to tear down the vortex 
yeah  i did  but   
i don t wanna hear it 
sydney 
no 
don t grovel  tyler 
you re above it 
things are looking grim 
brothers 
i am so sorry about this 
you guys 
you should ve just left us alone 
we were fine until you came along
and made us your guinea pigs 
you guys    it s so important
for us to stand up to the greeks
and show them that
they can t trample all over us 
well  it s also important for us
to have a place to live 
 phone rings 
hello 
dad 
 laughs  got you  you ve reached royal plumbing
at the white house  no  not that one 
this is paul and sydney s  leave a message 
 beep 
hi  dad  i was just calling
to say    i miss you 
and that s it  um   
everything s great here  really great 
i love you 
it was that message last night  i could tell something
wasn t right  i could hear it in your voice 
so i got in the van
and i drove all through the night 
i was a little surprised to find
you weren t at the kappa house  though 
i wanted to tell you
so many times but   
i kept thinking about mom
and i felt like i d failed her 
and you always sounded
so proud of me on the phone 
sweetheart  following in your mother s footsteps
is not about reliving her life 
it s about being
the same kind of person she was 
hey 
your mom was much more
than just a kappa 
she was a woman who always fought
for what she believed in  and so are you 
nothing could make me
prouder than that 
not even when i installed
that water filtration system in under an hour 
that was pretty great 
 laughs 
 knock at door 
 grunts 
but it says   do not disturb  
 knocking continues 
up and at  em  guys 
it s time to make some plans 
i know you re still pissed at me  but come on 
are you gonna wallow here in this fleabag motel
because some prissy girly girl who probably
doesn t know who gandalf is screwed us over 
you re right 
i bet she doesn t know who gandalf is 
 laughter 
we re still mad at you  though 
that s ok  i want you to be mad 
i want you to get fired up
so we can win this election 
because the freedom to the 7th power
party will prevail 
yeah 
with our new candidate for president 
me  i m gonna run against rachel 
and we re gonna take her down 
    stand up  by mêlée 
i m sydney white
and i m running for student council president   
i m sydney white and i m running for student council
president on the freedom to the 7th power ticket 
your papers count for three quarters of
your final grade and no late papers will be accepted 
as you re writing these papers  i want you to think
about the mechanics of modern campaigning 
you may be wondering why you should even care 
why bother voting 
the greeks win every year
and it s one more way they run the school 
there s a whole lot of talk today
about the need to cater to your base 
but there s something to be said
for thinking outside of that box 
 sydney  freedom to the 7th power 
whoo hoo 
freedom to the 7th power 
 man  good job 
 groans 
the fact is that 80  of the student body
at southern atlantic is not greek  80  
take the kennedy campaign in 1960 
he was inherently an outsider  
a catholic had never been elected as president  
who reached out to other outsiders 
 students chant in hebrew 
l chaim 
l chaim 
 sydney  to those students i say 
it s time for you to be heard 
 carlton  minorities  women  the poor  
the disenfranchised won
that election for john kennedy 
 naked pain  
an epic poem in 12 parts 
it s time for you to be heard 
and we are here to listen 
 cheering 
 chanting in hebrew 
it s a lesson worth remembering 
whoo hoo
