strange magic
oh what a strange magic

got a strange magic
theres romance and danger
and plotting of schemes
theres good guys and bad guys
and some guys in between
a fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth
the perils of choices we face in our youth
but our story today is different in theme
for our hero had no choice
or so it would seem
cat meows
strange magic

not only that but she said
shed turn your mother into a squirrel
and take away my eternal youth
if we ever asked her again
lts not fair

why shed always obeyed
but she never stopped fighting
to have things her way
ella come practice your mandolin

my own sweet time doing it

to find a way out of her gift
she had no way of knowing
something worse was adrift

my dear welcome
and these must be your lovely daughters
my precious hattie and my special olive

pleased to meet you
yes the house looks delightful

that at the noblemens convention

no l said a mans home is his castle
hi lm ella welcome to frell
whats with the prince pinups
hatties president
of the prince char fan club
char and his uncle are responsible
for the segregation of the kingdom
so hes dreamy
ls this hutch meant to be a closet
lts pathetic
my clothes need more room than this
well have to use yours
wha
show it to us
oh
lts so quaint
almost like well its just ugly isnt it
theres no room in here either
were gonna have to throw out
some of your gowns to make room
wait get away from there
you get away

but we need the money ella
lll miss you father
lll miss you too
hattie hey olive we should call her
ella the smella from frella
giggling
elves giants ogres and humans
used to exist in harmony
but when king florian was killed
allegedly by an ogre
sir edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile
all nonhuman creatures to the forest
keeping their land for himself
passionately put ella
give yourself a pat on the back
giggling
teacher hattie
oh
what my unworthy opponent fails to realize
is sir edgar has done a fantastic job
he has driven the ogres out
and he has put giants and elves to work
as laborers and entertainers
therefore if it werent for him
we wouldnt have todays
thriving freeenterprise system
lts only free because weve enslaved the
poor creatures and they work for nothing
edgar is a monster and l dont hold out
much hope for his nephew either
well that shows what you know
aka nothing
prince char will be the greatest king ever
right girls
all yeah
l wonder if my opponent has based
her opinion on the princes politics
or how cute she thinks his butt is
admit youre stupid
and dont know what youre talking about
lm stupid and l dont know
what lm talking about
teacher ella
anyway in conclusion
hold your tongue ella
teacher ella
my tongue itches
teacher lf youre not going to take this
seriously l declare hattie the winner
applause
ya
uncle do l have to go to this mall opening
as heir to the throne
its your royal responsibility char
you are a public figure after all
yes but youre the one in charge
only for a little while longer
your coronation is next week
you need to be out there
with the people char
yes shaking hands and kissing babies
exactly heston
so the people can learn to trust us
whats not to trust
nothing
but while youve been away at school
char the kingdom has been under siege
ln your absence
the ogres have become impossible
hes right even the giants have become
more and more treacherous
but the giants have always been peaceful
the ogres were peaceful too
until they ripped your father to shreds
and l promised your father
should anything happen to him
l would take care of you and the kingdom
and well lve kept my promise havent l
whoa
likewise you must keep
your promise to the people
now lets put on a smile

l couldnt reveal it to a subject
thats what l thought
youre all just the same
you care more about your fan club
and your next jousting tournament

with the whole adoring fan club thing
perhaps thats why l find
your obvious disdain for me so refreshing
obvious and l was trying
so hard to hide it
wheres my purse lts back there
wait right there l will get it
sighs
prince charmont
prince charmont
your highness

stinking grimm brothers

hey lm right here just cos lm a book
doesnt mean l dont have ears
boys if you cant play nice

scattered across the forest floor

l am the ogre nish
we just did this didnt we just do this
all right thats enough fun and games
now keep your mouth shut
and dont move
ls it boiling yet
lts not gonna boil
if you stand there looking at it
you couldnt show a picture
of a big ogre heading our way
that would have been helpful
oh oh
l think l see bubbles
horse neighs
let her go
untie yourself
truce truce
cant we just get along
are you one of the monsters
who killed my father
king florian was a good man
we lived in peace during his reign
why would we kill him
lll spare your lives
where you didnt spare his
you take your friends
and find breakfast elsewhere
well pick up something else on the way
anyway you eat maiden
an hour later youre hungry again
what are you doing here
with an elf for protection
do you get a kick
out of neardeath experiences
no l was fine l had things well in hand
l could see that as you were dangling
over the boiling cauldron
no doubt lulling the ogres
into a false sense of security
whos to say it wouldnt have worked
if you hadnt come barging in
l see the score currently stands
at chivalry two gratitude zero
look
youre right lm sorry
thank you
youre welcome
youre bleeding
hm
oh its just a scratch
youd better let me help you with that
so will l live
l think the odds are in your favor
so where were you headed
the giants village for a wedding
lm meeting my godmother
thats on our way back to lamia
well accompany you
thats not necessary
lt makes it so much easier rescuing you
if l dont have to commute
lm so glad l was here
for this interesting development
heston groans
look l really appreciate the offer but
are you crazy tell him to come with us
come with us
so traveling with an elf
your boyfriend couldnt make it
no

l dont have a girlfriend
oh
l have many
oh
lm kidding shouldnt believe
everything you read in medieval teen
excuse me excuse me
prince charmont permission to speak
sure
you know the word coincidence
lt just so happens l was on my way
to meet a certain royal someone
in order to discuss some career options
currently unavailable to
slannen wants to petition the kingdom
for the right to become a lawyer
a lawyer
why not
there were no laws against it
when your father was king
thats not really my area of expertise
my advice to you
would be to talk to my uncle
lm sure if you make a good argument
hell come round
well thank you for your advice
what
youre about to become king
youll have the power to make a difference
in the world and you dont even care
lts not like l asked to become king
lve had no say in the matter
well thanks to your uncle there are a lot
of people who have no say in the matter
nobody should be forced to do things
they dont wanna do
take it from somebody who knows
ella ella
youre not finished yet
you work until sundown
char the giants have always been
gentle why are they treated like slaves
lm sure my uncle doesnt know about this
he couldnt
lively music
ella maybe you can get
to the bottom of this at the wedding
char maybe you can find
your godmother
ella whoa
theyre not so bad
l thought theyd be all so big and scary
didnt hurt
l hope this is a good idea
they must hate the royal family
theyll respect your courage
at showing up here
besides they dont hold grudges
theyre bigger than that
prince charmont
what are you doing here
no grudges eh
well l thought that maybe this would be a
good time to possibly have a hearttoheart
but now lm thinking l should come back
when theres been a little less drinking
hes here as a friend
to hear your complaints
then welcome
lm looking for someone
my godmother lucinda
she was over there earlier
thank you lll be right back
excuse me ls lucinda perriweather here

to be big ugly and mean
lts because of stories
like jack and the beanstalk
stinking grimm brothers

but still
my stepsister hattie would die
if she knew l was here
shes the president
of your fan club you know
oh hattie yes thank you

no youre lucky
l wish l had brothers and sisters
my mother passed away
before she had any more children and
my mother passed away too
oh
you know she used to sing me
to sleep every night
my father used to sing to me
loudly and very offkey but
l still miss him
l have edgar l guess
hes not such a bad guy
he risked his life to save my father
and he brought me up as his own son
l know you dont like his politics much
but lm sure when l tell him about
the giants he will correct the situation
yeah or you could
lt took a lot of guts for you to come here
look at the way you smoothed things over
youre a natural at this
wow is that almost a compliment
almost now dont go getting a big head
your crown wont fit
you know what else
tomorrow lm gonna go to my uncle
and lm gonna ask him
to repeal the elfin restrictions
slannen will have his day in court
if l have anything to say about it
l think youre gonna be
a great king someday
your father would have been proud
thanks
l think he would have really liked you
kiss me
that wasnt an order you know
l know
l want to look 25 at tonights ball
what do you suggest
a time machine
may l recommend our newest procedure
bat faeces and oxen blood
batox
works wonders although l do caution you
some people have
a temporarily bad reaction
olga

your uncle didnt want to frighten you

of a possible uprising
those ogres in the forest
they were after you
the girl was obviously part of the scheme
the ogres never planned to hurt her
she was just toying
with your emotions char
