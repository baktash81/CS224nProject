with giants and dragons
and ogres and elves 
and inanimate objects
that speak for themselves 
strange magic
oh  what a strange magic
oh  it s a strange magic
got a strange magic
got a strange magic
there s romance and danger
and plotting of schemes 
there s good guys and bad guys
and some guys in between 
a fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth 
the perils of choices we face in our youth 
but our story today is different in theme 
for our hero had no choice 
or so it would seem 
   cat meows 
   strange magic
it starts with a fairy bestowing a spell 
this one s for a baby named ella of arell 
got a strange magic
got a strange magic
now  now  ella  mother s here 
there  now  oh  dear ella 
oh  it s nothing a little burping won t cure 
  up 
  there  now

now  go to sleep

  lsn t it wonderful 
  no  it s terrible 
lt s a terrible gift to have to do
what you re told  take it back 
l have a no return policy 
and if you re going to be ungrateful  l can
always turn her into a squirrel instead 
  a squirrel 
  no  obedience is a lovely gift 
besides  you should thank me 
l ve just given you the perfect child 
ln spite of the spell 
ella grew up strong of mind 
her gift made her obedient 
but her heart made her kind 
why don t you go back
to where you came from

sweetie  stop 
l always knew
something was wrong with me 
can t you take the spell back 
you re a fairy 
l m only a household fairy  honey 
besides  according to fairy guidelines 
only the fairy who gave you the gift
can take it back  and we ve begged her 
not only that  but she said
she d turn your mother into a squirrel
and take away my eternal youth
if we ever asked her again 
lt s not fair 
l know  darling  l know 
so ella now knew
why she d always obeyed 
but she never stopped fighting
to have things her way 
ella  come practice your mandolin 
fine  but l ll take
my own sweet time doing it 
hurry up  now 
as she struggled
to find a way out of her gift 
she had no way of knowing
something worse was adrift 
please get well  mother 
listen to me 
only mandy and l know about the gift 
we ve never even told your father 
and you must never tell anyone else 
  l don t want anyone using it against you 
  mother  please 
remember  no matter
what anyone says or tells you to do 
look to yourself  ella 
what s inside you
is stronger than any spell 
take this  then l ll always be with you 
a strange magic
strange magic
a strange magic
 mandy  ella 
your father would like to speak to you 
  you re married 
  she has money  ella 
and she s very fond of my title 
lt was either get married or sell the house 
you ll adore dame olga 
and her two daughters 
she ll make a wonderful mother 
well  a motherlike figure 
look  l m sure

whoa

my dear  welcome 
and these must be your lovely daughters 
my precious hattie and my special olive 
oh 
  and you must be ella 
  pleased to meet you 
yes  the house looks delightful 
but l do seem to remember
that at the noblemen s convention
you said that you lived in a castle 
no  l said a man s home is his castle 
hi  l m ella  welcome to frell 
what s with the prince pinups 
hattie s president
of the prince char fan club 
char and his uncle are responsible
for the segregation of the kingdom 
so  he s dreamy 
ls this hutch meant to be a closet 
lt s pathetic 
my clothes need more room than this 
  we ll have to use yours 
  wha    
show it to us 
oh 
lt s so    quaint 
almost like  well  it s just ugly  isn t it 
there s no room in here  either 
we re gonna have to throw out
some of your gowns to make room 
  wait  get away from there 
  you get away 
oh 
what s this  l do actually like this 
please don t touch it  lt was my mother s 
  can l have it 
  no 
oh 
lt can be your welcome gift to me 
come on  hand it over 
oh 
aren t you accommodating 
 giggling 
the second l sell the last of these 
l ll be back  l promise 
l know it s not a great job 
not even a good job  
ok  even a monkey could do it  
but we need the money  ella 
  l ll miss you  father 
  l ll miss you  too 
 hattie  hey  olive  we should call her
ella the smella from frella 
 giggling 
elves  giants  ogres and humans
used to exist in harmony 
but when king florian was killed 
allegedly by an ogre 
sir edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile
all nonhuman creatures to the forest 
keeping their land for himself 
passionately put  ella 
give yourself a pat on the back 
 giggling 
 teacher  hattie 
oh 
what my unworthy opponent fails to realize
is sir edgar has done a fantastic job 
he has driven the ogres out 
and he has put giants and elves to work
as laborers and entertainers 
therefore  if it weren t for him 
we wouldn t have today s
thriving free enterprise system 
lt s only free because we ve enslaved the
poor creatures and they work for nothing 
edgar is a monster  and l don t hold out
much hope for his nephew  either 
well  that shows what you know 
aka nothing 
prince char will be the greatest king ever 
  right  girls 
   all  yeah 
l wonder if my opponent has based
her opinion on the prince s politics
or how cute she thinks his butt is 
admit you re stupid
and don t know what you re talking about 
l m stupid and l don t know
what l m talking about 
 teacher  ella 
anyway  in conclusion   
hold your tongue  ella 
 teacher  ella 
my tongue itches 
 teacher  lf you re not going to take this
seriously  l declare hattie the winner 
 applause 
ya 
uncle  do l have to go to this mall opening 
as heir to the throne 
it s your royal responsibility  char 
  you are a public figure  after all 
  yes  but you re the one in charge 
only for a little while longer 
your coronation is next week 
you need to be out there
with the people  char 
yes  shaking hands and kissing babies 
exactly  heston 
so the people can learn to trust us 
what s not to trust 
nothing 
but while you ve been away at school 
char  the kingdom has been under siege 
ln your absence 
the ogres have become impossible 
he s right  even the giants have become
more and more treacherous 
but the giants have always been peaceful 
the ogres were peaceful too 
until they ripped your father to shreds 
and l promised your father 
should anything happen to him 
l would take care of you and the kingdom 
and  well  l ve kept my promise  haven t l 
whoa 
likewise  you must keep
your promise to the people 
now  let s put on a smile 
remember  image is everything 
    walking on sunshine  
 cheering 
thank you 
thank you  thank you 
lt s wonderful to be here
in your charming town of    frell 
prince charmont and l   
we want char  we want char 
we want char  we want char 
we want char 
now it is my great pleasure to welcome
my nephew  prince charmont

  ella  you are embarrassing us

  ow 
  shush  shush  shush 
and don t it feel good 
  prince charmont 
  please  call me    call me char 
sorry about that 
occupational hazard 
  allow me 
  l don t need your chivalry  thanks 
and l ve no intention of curtsying 
either  so forget it 
you can curtsy or not  that s your choice 
there s really nothing l can do about it 
except have you beheaded 
but that seems a bit extreme 
charming  why don t you do
what your people usually do 
steal my land and destroy my livelihood 
lf you ll excuse me   
wait a second  come back here 
hm 
what is your name 
ella of frell 
well  ella of frell 
you re the first maiden l ve met
who hasn t swooned at the sight of me 
then maybe l ve done you some good 
look  l ve never stolen
anyone s land or livelihood 
l want peace in the kingdom
as much as anyone 
so you have a new plan
once you take the crown 
well   
sort of  of course 
l couldn t reveal it to a subject 
that s what l thought 
you re all just the same 
you care more about your fan club
and your next jousting tournament 
no  actually  l ve never been comfortable
with the whole adoring fan club thing 
perhaps that s why l find
your obvious disdain for me so refreshing 
obvious  and l was trying
so hard to hide it 
where s my purse  lt s back there 
wait right there  l will get it 
 sighs 
prince charmont 
prince charmont 
your highness 
are you crazy  why didn t you move 
l would have    were it not for your apparent
fascination with knocking me to the ground 
that s the second time today  you realize 
l ll try and be more considerate
next time l m saving you 
next time  what makes you think
we ll see each other again 
well  won t we 
no 
ella of frell  you are not like other girls

girls  go and dust off your ball gowns
and pack your bags 
l think l may have found you

to perform at the coronation

we re going to giantville 
lt s on the way  come with us

with an elf  they think we re a joke 
l have met prince charmont  and l think
he might be different than his uncle 
  why  cos he s a hunk 
  no 
  what is he  about six foot 
  about 
yeah  l hate the guy already 
l m not wasting my time 
lacking courage as well as height 
count me in 
elves aren t that short  you know 
that s just a myth created by that stupid
elves and the shoemaker story 
  do l look small enough to fit in a shoe 
  no 
stinking grimm brothers 
are you sure he knows where he s going 
hey  l m right here  just cos l m a book
doesn t mean l don t have ears 
boys  if you can t play nice 
you can t play together 
 rustling 
oh  no  the rustling always comes
before the screaming and the running 
l knew this was gonna happen 
they ll just find pieces of us
scattered across the forest floor 
oh  a bunny  you know  the last known
case of a bunny attack was  well  never 
lt never hurts to be on your guard 
 twig snaps 
nobody panic  nobody panic 
l ve got this in hand 
oi 
you  thumper 
out of the forest or no more carrots for you 
l don t like carrots 
how do you feel about rabbits 
cos one just went thataway 
l am the ogre  nish 
how do you like to be eaten 
baked  boiled  shish kebabbed 
how about free range 
stop  no 
ella of frell  hi  how are you doing 
l think there s been a big mistake here 
see  l m pro ogre 
pro ogre 
absolutely  l led a rally on your behalf
the other day  maybe you heard about it 
lt ll only hurt for a moment  l promise 
l m a fast eater 
slannen  slannen 
please  l want to help 
help  from a human 
humans took everything from us 
l was an ogre of leisure  with a simple life 
  next thing you know   
  now  not this again 
nish  hurry up  l m starving 
right  you  into the pot 
forget that 
  who are you 
  l am the ogre  nish 
we just did this  didn t we just do this 
all right  that s enough fun and games 
now  keep your mouth shut
and don t move 
ls it boiling yet 
lt s not gonna boil
if you stand there looking at it 
you couldn t show a picture
of a big ogre heading our way 
  that would have been helpful 
  oh  oh 
l think l see bubbles 
 horse neighs 
let her go 
untie yourself 
truce  truce 
can t we just get along 
are you one of the monsters
who killed my father 
king florian was a good man 
we lived in peace during his reign 
why would we kill him 
l ll spare your lives
where you didn t spare his 
you take your friends
and find breakfast elsewhere 
we ll pick up something else on the way 
anyway  you eat maiden 
an hour later you re hungry again 
what are you doing here 
with an elf for protection 
do you get a kick
out of near death experiences 
no  l was fine  l had things well in hand 
l could see that  as you were dangling
over the boiling cauldron 
no doubt lulling the ogres
into a false sense of security 
who s to say it wouldn t have worked
if you hadn t come barging in 
l see the score currently stands
at chivalry two  gratitude zero 
look   
you re right  l m sorry 
  thank you 
  you re welcome 
  you re bleeding 
  hm 
oh  it s just a scratch 
you d better let me help you with that 
  so  will l live 
  l think the odds are in your favor 
so    where were you headed 
the giants  village for a wedding 
l m meeting my godmother 
that s on our way back to lamia 
we ll accompany you 
that s not necessary 
lt makes it so much easier rescuing you
if l don t have to commute 
l m so glad l was here
for this interesting development 
 heston groans 
  look  l really appreciate the offer  but   
  are you crazy  tell him to come with us 
come with us 
so  traveling with an elf 
your boyfriend couldn t make it 
  no 
  oh 
  because l don t have one 
  oh 
your girlfriend doesn t mind
being left alone 
  l don t have a girlfriend 
  oh 
  l have many 
  oh 
l m kidding  shouldn t believe
everything you read in medieval teen 
excuse me  excuse me 
prince charmont  permission to speak 
  sure 
  you know the word coincidence 
lt just so happens l was on my way
to meet a certain royal someone
in order to discuss some career options
currently unavailable to   
slannen wants to petition the kingdom
for the right to become a lawyer 
  a lawyer 
  why not 
there were no laws against it
when your father was king 
that s not really my area of expertise 
my advice to you
would be to talk to my uncle 
l m sure if you make a good argument 
he ll come round 
well  thank you for your    advice 
  what 
  you re about to become king 
you ll have the power to make a difference
in the world and you don t even care 
lt s not like l asked to become king 
l ve had no say in the matter 
well  thanks to your uncle  there are a lot
of people who have no say in the matter 
nobody should be forced to do things
they don t wanna do 
take it from somebody who knows 
ella  ella 
you re not finished yet 
you work until sundown 
  char  the giants have always been
gentle  why are they treated like slaves 
l m sure my uncle doesn t know about this 
he couldn t 
 lively music 
 ella  maybe you can get
to the bottom of this at the wedding 
  char  maybe you can find
your godmother 
 ella  whoa 
they re not so bad 
l thought they d be all so big and scary 
didn t hurt 
l hope this is a good idea 
they must hate the royal family 
they ll respect your courage
at showing up here 
besides  they don t hold grudges 
they re bigger than that 
prince charmont 
what are you doing here 
no grudges  eh 
well  l thought that maybe this would be a
good time to possibly have a heart to heart 
but now l m thinking l should come back
when there s been a little less drinking 
he s here as a friend
to hear your complaints 
then welcome 
l m looking for someone 
my godmother  lucinda 
she was over there earlier 
thank you  l ll be right back 
excuse me  ls lucinda perriweather here 
too late  sweetheart

you know  l hope
you don t mind me saying this 
but you re much prettier
than l would have expected 
oh  l know  giants are supposed
to be big  ugly and mean 
lt s because of stories
like jack and the beanstalk 
stinking grimm brothers 
l ve seen weirder couples 
none that immediately come to mind 
but still 
my stepsister hattie would die
if she knew l was here 
she s the president
of your fan club  you know 
oh  hattie  yes  thank you 
now l know what name
to put on the restraining order

l wish l had brothers and sisters 
my mother passed away
before she had any more children and   
my mother passed away  too 
oh 
you know  she used to sing me
to sleep every night 
my father used to sing to me 
loudly and very off key  but   
l still miss him 
l have edgar  l guess 
he s not such a bad guy 
he risked his life to save my father 
and he brought me up as his own son 
l know you don t like his politics much 
but l m sure when l tell him about
the giants  he will correct the situation 
yeah  or you could 
lt took a lot of guts for you to come here 
look at the way you smoothed things over 
you re a natural at this 
wow  is that almost a compliment 
almost  now  don t go getting a big head 
your crown won t fit 
you know what else 
tomorrow l m gonna go to my uncle
and l m gonna ask him
to repeal the elfin restrictions 
slannen will have his day in court 
if l have anything to say about it 
l think you re gonna be
a great king someday 
your father would have been proud 
thanks 
l think he would have really liked you 
kiss me 
that wasn t an order  you know 
l know 
l want to look 25 at tonight s ball 
what do you suggest 
a time machine 
may l recommend our newest procedure 
bat faeces and oxen blood 
batox

some people have
a temporarily bad reaction 
  olga

at some point 
amidst your frolicking and romancing 
prince char will sweep you away
to the hall of mirrors 
then  just before midnight 
he will take you by the hand
and ask you a question 
how do you know all this 
we know everything  my dear 
and the one thing we know
with most certainty
is that at the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger
and plunge it
through his heart and kill him 
no  no  l won t 
oh  yes  you will 
you will  because l order you to 
 edgar chuckles 
actually  it s lucky you re here

that this is the only solution 
i wish you the best 
i really do believe

 narrator  now  if she stayed clear
of the prince until midnight had passed

the hall of mirrors 
when l was little 
my father brought me in here 
he told me to look in the mirror
and see myself as a great leader 
somehow  l never could 
and then you come along 
ella  what s wrong 
l wish l could tell you 
l wish l could tell you everything 
these last few days have been so perfect 
well  except for the bit
where we almost got eaten by ogres 
and you wrote me a letter
that ripped my heart out 
and l had to dance with hattie 
but none of these things matter 
we re together now 
and when we re together  it s like magic 
  l never want it to end 
  l know  l know 
  and l feel the same  but   
  that s why l brought you here

ella   
ella of frell  will you marry me 
 clock chimes

   hattie  ella  come here 
    olga  don t argue  just do it 
    olive  take that

you will no longer be obedient 
 clock strikes midnight

 edgar  you realize  of course 
she ll have to be put to death immediately 
l just don t understand 
maybe l should go and talk to her 
no  no  l forbid you to go down there 
your highness 
your uncle didn t want to frighten you 
but the secret police informed us
of a possible uprising 
those ogres in the forest 
they were after you 
the girl was obviously part of the scheme 
the ogres never planned to hurt her 
she was just toying
with your emotions  char 
so she could get close to you
and commit the murder herself 
l    l just don t believe it 
yes  yes  it does seem quite fantastic 
you let me worry about all this  hm 
you just concentrate
on tomorrow s coronation 
sire  you know l ve been working
with the red guard 
why not call them in now and take over
the whole kingdom like we planned 
first we must find a way
to get rid of the prince 
and l think l have
a pretty good idea how to do it 
 cock crows 
all right  we just have to find a way
to get past those guards 
 benny  help  please 
somebody get me out of here 
benny  what s he doing here 
ugh 
  slannen  you ve saved my life 
  are you ok

l think ella s in trouble 
something to do with edgar 
we have to find her 
show me ella 
edgar s done this 
we ve gotta go in there and stop him 
lt ll take courage  bravery   
 elves scream 
l was gonna ask you
how you d like to be eaten 
but if it s edgar you re after    count us in 
welcome aboard 
executioner coming through 
enter 
  help 
  l wouldn t do that if l were you 
open up  l m miss frell s
legal representation

lf the gauntlet doesn t fit 
you must acquit 
now  open this door before l sue you
for everything you own 
now  move it  come on  come on 
thank you  slannen of pim is not an elf
easily drawn into a legal battle 
but when faced with a challenge
to equality  freedom and civil liberties 
this elf will draw the sword of justice 
and  furthermore

  well  can we at least take him to go 
  put the nice man down

you said  look inside yourself
you can break the spell
believe the voice inside of you
live out your dreams
and make them true
through your eyes you helped me see
with your love you set me free
wishes can come true
   if you believe
   if you believe in love
live out your dreams
and make them true
if you believe in love
