see  a long time ago 
there was this family 
the papá  he was a musician 
he and his family
would sing and dance
and count their blessings 
but he also had a dream 
to play for the world 
and one day   
he left with his guitar   
and never returned 
and my mamá   
she didn t have time to cry
over that walk away musician 
after banishing all music
from her life   
she found a way
to provide for her daughter 
she rolled up her sleeves   
and she learned to make shoes 
she could have made candy 
o o or fireworks 
or sparkly underwear for wrestlers 
but no 
she chose shoes 
then she taught
her daughter to make shoes 
and later  she taught
her son in law 
then her grandkids got roped in 
as her family grew 
so did the business 
music have torn
her family apart 
but shoes held
them all together 
you see that woman   
was my great great grandmother   
mamáimelda 
she died way before i was born 
but my family still
tells her story   
every year on día de los muertos
    the day of the dead   
and her little girl 
she s my great grandmother  mamácoco 
hola  mamácoco 
how are you  julio 
actually  my name is miguel 
mamácoco has trouble
remembering things 
but it s good to talk to her 
anyway 
so  i tell her
pretty much everything 
i used to run like this 
but now i run like this 
it s just way faster 
the winner is   
luchadora coco 
i have a dimple on this side 
but not on this side 
dimple  no dimple 
dimple  no dimple 
miguel  eat your food 
my abuelita  she s
mamácoco s daughter 
aw  you re a twig  mijo 
have some more 
no  gracias 
i asked if you would like
more tamales 
s si 
that s what i thought you said 
abuelita runs the house
just as mamáimelda did 
no music 
no music 
  aunque la vida     
no music 
i think we re the only family
in mexico who hates music 
and my family s fine with that 
but me   
be back by lunch  mijo 
love you  mamá 
i m not like the rest
of my family 
  hola  miguel 
  hola 
  muchas gracias 
  de nada  miguel 
he hey  dante 
sit 
down 
roll over 
shake 
fist bump 
good boy  dante 
i know  i m not supposed
to love music 
but it s not my fault 
it s his 
ernesto de la cruz 
the greatest musician
of all time 
here in this very plaza 
the young ernesto de la cruz
took his first steps
toward becoming
the most beloved singer
in mexican history 
he started out a total nobody
from santa cecilia  like me 
but when he played music 
he made people
fall in love with him 
he starred in movies 
he had the coolest guitar 
he could fly 
and he wrote the best songs 
but my all time favorite is   
  remember me  
  though i have to say goodbye  
  remember me  
  don t let it make you cry  
  for even if i m far away  
  i hold you in my heart  
  i sing a secret song to you  
  each night we are apart
remember me  
  though i have to travel far  
  remember me  
  each time you hear a sad guitar  
  know that i m with you the
only way that i can be     
  until you re in my arms again  
he lived the kind of life you dream about   
  remember me  
until 1942 
when he was crushed
by a giant bell 
i wanna be just like him 
sometimes  i look at de la cruz   
and i get this feeling 
like we re connected somehow 
like if he could play music   
maybe someday  i could too 
if it wasn t for my family 
ay  ay  ay  muchacho 
huh 
i asked for a shoe shine 
not your life story 
oh  yeah  sorry 
i just can t really talk about
any of this at home  so 
look  if i were you 
i d march right up
to my family and say 
 hey  i m a musician 
deal with it  
i could never say that 
you are a musician  no 
i could never say that 
you are a musician  no 
i i i don t know 
i mean  i only really
play for myself 
ah  did de la cruz become
the world s best musician
by hiding his sweet 
sweet skills 
no 
he walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud 
mira  mira  they re
setting up for tonight 
the music competition for
día de muertos 
you wanna be like your hero 
you should sign up 
unh unh  my family would freak 
look  if you re too scared 
then  well  have fun making shoes

his permission 
i am done
asking permission 
when you see your moment 
you mustn t let it pass you by 
you must seize it 
señor de la cruz

a giant papaya 
dancers emerge from the papaya

from the milk of their mother 
who is a cactus 
but who is also me 
and her milk is not milk   
but tears

he wanted to play for the world 
we each made a sacrifice
to get what we wanted 
now  you must make a choice

done it differently 
one cannot deny
who one is meant to be

i just met him tonight 
he told me he knew you 
h   héctor 
please  miguel 
put my photo up 
my friend  you re   
you re being forgotten 
and whose fault is that 
  héctor  please 
  those were my songs you took 
my songs that made you famous 
  what 
  if i m being forgotten   
it s because you never told anyone
that i wrote them 
that s crazy  de la cruz
wrote all his own songs 
you wanna tell him 
or should i 
héctor  i never meant to take credit 
we made a great team  but   
you died  and    i i only sang
your songs because
i wanted to keep
a part of you alive 
oh  how generous 
you really did play together 
look  i don t want to fight about it 
i just want you to make it right 
miguel can put my photo up 
  héctor 
  and i can cross over the bridge 
i could see my girl 
ernesto 
remember the night i left 
that was a long time ago 
we drank together 
and you told me you would move
heaven and earth for your amigo 
well  i m asking you to now 
heaven and earth 
like in the movie 
what 
that s don hidalgo s toast 
in the de la cruz movie 
 el camino a casa  
i m talking about my real life  miguel 
no  it s in there 
look 
this calls for a toast 
to our friendship  haha 
i would move heaven
and earth for you  mi amigo 
but in the movie  don hidalgo
poisons the drink 
salud 
poison 
that night  ernesto 
the night i left 
we ve been performing
on the road for months 
i got homesick
and i packed up my songs 
you wanna give up now 
when we re this close
to reaching our dream 
this was your dream 
you ll manage 
i can t do this
without your songs  héctor 
i m going home  ernesto 
hate me if you want 
but my mind is made up 
oh  i could never hate you 
if you must go  then i m   
i m sending you off with a toast 
to our friendship 
i would move heaven
and earth for you  mi amigo 
salud 
you walked me to the train station 
but i felt a pain in my stomach 
i thought it must have
been something i ate 
perhaps it was that chorizo 
my friend 
or something i drank 
i woke up dead 
you   
poisoned me 
you re confusing movies
with reality  héctor 
all this time  i thought
it was just bad luck 
i never thought that you might have   
that you   
how could you 
héctor 
security  security 
you took everything away from me 
you rat 
have him taken care of 
he s not well 
i just wanted to move back home

where were we 
you were going
to give me your blessing 
yes    ah    si

the good guy 
papáernesto

i always hoped i d see her again 
that she d miss me 
maybe put up my photo 
but it never happened 
you know the worst part 
even if i never got to see
coco in the living world   
i thought at least one day 
i d see her here 
give her the biggest hug 
but she s the last person
who remembers me 
the moment she s gone
from the living world   
you disappear 
from this one 
you ll never get to see her 
ever again 
you know   
i wrote her a song once 
we used to sing it every night 
at the same time 
no matter how far apart we were 
what i wouldn t give
to sing it to her 
one   
last   
time 
  remember me  
  though i have to say goodbye  
  remember me  
  don t let it make you cry  
  for even if i m far away  
  i hold you in my heart  
  i sing a secret song to you  
  each night we are apart  
  remember me  
papá 
  though i have to travel far  
  remember me  
  each time you hear a sad guitar  
  know that i m with you  
  the only way that i can be  
  until you re in my arms again  
  remember  
  me

great great grandpa
