see a long time ago
there was this family
the papá he was a musician
he and his family
would sing and dance
and count their blessings
but he also had a dream
to play for the world
and one day
he left with his guitar
and never returned
and my mamá
she didnt have time to cry
over that walkaway musician
after banishing all music
from her life
she found a way
to provide for her daughter
she rolled up her sleeves
and she learned to make shoes
she could have made candy
ooor fireworks
or sparkly underwear for wrestlers
but no
she chose shoes
then she taught
her daughter to make shoes
and later she taught
her soninlaw
then her grandkids got roped in
as her family grew
so did the business
music have torn
her family apart
but shoes held
them all together
you see that woman
was my greatgreatgrandmother
mamáimelda
she died way before i was born
but my family still
tells her story
every year on día de los muertos
the day of the dead
and her little girl
shes my greatgrandmother mamácoco
hola mamácoco
how are you julio
actually my name is miguel
mamácoco has trouble
remembering things
but its good to talk to her
anyway
so i tell her
pretty much everything
i used to run like this
but now i run like this
its just way faster
the winner is
luchadora coco
i have a dimple on this side
but not on this side
dimple no dimple
dimple no dimple
miguel eat your food
my abuelita shes
mamácocos daughter
aw youre a twig mijo

no gracias
i asked if you would like
more tamales
ssi
thats what i thought you said
abuelita runs the house
just as mamáimelda did
no music
no music
aunque la vida
no music
i think were the only family
in mexico who hates music
and my familys fine with that
but me
be back by lunch mijo
love you mamá
im not like the rest
of my family
hola miguel
hola
muchas gracias
de nada miguel
hehey dante
sit
down
roll over
shake
fist bump
good boy dante
i know im not supposed
to love music
but its not my fault
its his
ernesto de la cruz
the greatest musician
of all time
here in this very plaza
the young ernesto de la cruz
took his first steps
toward becoming
the most beloved singer
in mexican history
he started out a total nobody
from santa cecilia like me
but when he played music
he made people
fall in love with him
he starred in movies
he had the coolest guitar
he could fly
and he wrote the best songs
but my alltime favorite is
remember me
though i have to say goodbye
remember me
dont let it make you cry
for even if im far away
i hold you in my heart
i sing a secret song to you
each night we are apart
remember me
though i have to travel far
remember me
each time you hear a sad guitar
know that im with you the
only way that i can be
until youre in my arms again
he lived the kind of life you dream about
remember me
until 1942
when he was crushed
by a giant bell
i wanna be just like him
sometimes i look at de la cruz
and i get this feeling
like were connected somehow
like if he could play music
maybe someday i could too
if it wasnt for my family
ay ay ay muchacho
huh
i asked for a shoe shine
not your life story
oh yeah sorry
i just cant really talk about
any of this at home so
look if i were you
id march right up
to my family and say
hey im a musician
deal with it
i could never say that
you are a musician no
i could never say that
you are a musician no
iii dont know
i mean i only really
play for myself
ah did de la cruz become
the worlds best musician
by hiding his sweet
sweet skills
no
he walked out onto that plaza
and he played out loud

setting up for tonight
the music competition for
día de muertos

hhéctor
please miguel
put my photo up
my friend youre
youre being forgotten
and whose fault is that
héctor please
those were my songs you took
my songs that made you famous
what
if im being forgotten
its because you never told anyone
that i wrote them
thats crazy de la cruz
wrote all his own songs
you wanna tell him
or should i
héctor i never meant to take credit
we made a great team but
you died and ii only sang
your songs because
i wanted to keep
a part of you alive
oh how generous
you really did play together
look i dont want to fight about it
i just want you to make it right
miguel can put my photo up
héctor
and i can cross over the bridge
i could see my girl
ernesto
remember the night i left
that was a long time ago
we drank together
and you told me you would move
heaven and earth for your amigo

heaven and earth
like in the movie

in the de la cruz movie
el camino a casa
im talking about my real life miguel

to our friendship haha
i would move heaven
and earth for you mi amigo
but in the movie don hidalgo

that night ernesto
the night i left
weve been performing
on the road for months
i got homesick
and i packed up my songs

if you must go then im
im sending you off with a toast
to our friendship
i would move heaven
and earth for you mi amigo
salud
you walked me to the train station
but i felt a pain in my stomach
i thought it must have
been something i ate
perhaps it was that chorizo
my friend
or something i drank
i woke up dead

poisoned me
youre confusing movies
with reality héctor
