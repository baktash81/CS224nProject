that s what they say 
oh  mr  news  i need a
three inch item for a filler 
 mr  news  
i ll fill him someday 
so little nick is finally
getting his way  eh 
what did you say 
mr  kelsey 
you know  luther 
i was working out there
at the time of the murder 
oh  really 
yeah 
i was the gardener 
is that right 
young mrs  simmons was a
beautiful  beautiful woman 
sparkling black eyes
and skin like alabaster 
the old man was crazy jealous 
you know  luther 
it was just 20 years ago
this week   
they were both
found dead 
this week  they say what happened was this 
the two of them was in
the master bedroom arguin  
he was in a jealous rage 
suddenly he became violent 
stabbed her right in the throat 
they never did find out what with 
then he went
completely loco 
he ran up into the tower 
blood dripping from his hands 
and played that
pipe organ of his 
it was midnight  luther 
and he sat there   
playin  and laughin  and
screamin  to beat the band 
when the music
reached its peak 
he suddenly jumped up and
threw himself out the window 
they say the ghost
of old man simmons   
still climbs the tower   
and plays the organ   
at midnight 
luther  
aah 
let s have
that filler  
well  me  i just don t happen
to believe in ghosts   
particularly 
you know  luther 
i got an idea   
how you could write
a story for the paper 
how 
that filler 
i think folks d be interested in
reading about the simmons case again 
it bein  the 20th
anniversary and all 
you mean  write my own story
instead of using a standard filler 
sure 
do you think
i dare do that 
 course you do 
you know why 
huh 
 cause you got spunk 
you    you know  i guess
i got that from my mother 
she had
plenty of spunk 
all right 
let s see 
it was just  uh 
20 years ago   
come this tuesday   
that the bodies of mr  and
mrs  simmons were found 
mr  beckett   mr  beckett 
oh  hello  mrs  maxwell 
oh  it s wonderful 
the whole town s
talking about it 
i mean  the article
on the simmons mansion 
absolutely delicious 
well  thank you  i ve had a
lot of nice comment about that 
you know  my group and
i have always felt   
there s a very active spirit
life in that old house 
you mean  spooks 
ohh 
we prefer  manifestations  
well  keep up the good work 
i must run 
say  ollie  good reaction on that story
on the simmons place  do more on it 
do more  i haven t done anything on
it yet  nick simmons won t even see me 
you mean 
you didn t write this 
no  this isn t mine 
my idea was the passing
of a landmark 
well  if you didn t write
it  and i didn t write it 
who did 
um  do you know something
about this  mr  kelsey 
oh  what was that  i m afraid i
wasn t following the conversation 
oh  this 
oh  the luther heggs story 
luther 
i should have known
this was luther s work 
here  get this 
 the horribleness and the awfulness of
it will never actually be forgotten  
you know  tomorrow night
is the 20th anniversary   
of the murder
and suicide 
we ought to capitalize on it 
do it with a fresh approach 
i think somebody ought to spend
the anniversary night in the house 
i ve got an idea  i think somebody ought
to spend the anniversary night in the house 
hey  great  leave it to me  i ll
get in a little before midnight   
no  no 
not you  ollie 
what we need is somebody
with a a wild imagination 
someone who s a bit
of a coward 
someone who s
a a little superstitious 
luther  you all right

at the house 
 giving careful consideration to
the most advantageous means of entry 
i selected
the coal chute   
 once inside 
i had a look around 
 then made myself comfortable
for the night 
 suddenly there was a
strange knocking on the wall 
i remained cool  
i ll bet 
 moving swiftly  i found myself
in the organ loft 
 there it was 
the massive organ   
 shrouded in cobwebs  its
once beautiful ivory keys   
still covered with the stains
of young mrs  simmons s blood  
and they used bon ami 
 later  i descended
to the first floor 
 there  i was to see the most
horrifying display of all   
 in this bloody
parade of terror 
 the portrait of young mrs  simmons
had been stabbed in the throat   
 with what appeared to be a pair
of gardeners  pruning shears  
you ve never seen
anything like it 
i ll talk to you later  hey  al 
run off another 500 
they re selling like hotcakes 
we ve made some sort of hero out of luther

of doing one s duty   
no matter what is
scaring him    personally

a student of yours 
mm hmm  he was 
hi  luther 
how would you describe
mr  heggs as a boy 
oh  luther was
a very good boy 
he got three blue stars
in deportment   
and three gold stars
in penmanship 
how else would
you describe him 
he was painfully thin
and very keyed up 
would you elaborate on that
phrase   keyed up  
well  let s see 
well  for one thing  he never ate
the crusts on his sandwiches at lunch 
i object  i move that that statement
be stricken from the record 
a lot of people trim
the crust on their bread 
young man 
he didn t trim them 
he ate the inside out
and left the crust 
overruled 
and more specifically 
miss tremaine 
how else did he behave 
being keyed up  i mean 
his shoes
fell off a lot 
but i suppose that could be because
he was so thin and ran so much 
  was he a talkative boy 
  well  when he had a good story to tell 
and luther made up
some beauties 
what kind of stories  miss
tremaine  oh  wild things 
can you recall any
of them specifically 
well  i remember
he told all the boys   
that he found a real skeleton
in macqueen s barn 
of a squirrel  a squirrel 
i never said a person skeleton 
now you just quiet down  luther  or
i m gonna have to cite you for contempt 
they were my brother s shoes  that s
why they fell off  atta boy  luther  
quiet down now  folks 
do you recall any other of mr  heggs 
imaginative ramblings  miss tremaine 
oh  lots of things 
he told maryjane panucci   
that the filling
in his eyetooth   
was a shortwave radio   
and he used to get messages
from admiral byrd 
i only wanted her to like me 
go on  miss tremaine 
well 
i remember   
i once asked my students to
write a theme called   my father  
and luther wrote that his father
was really the prince of wales 
but that there was
a mix up at the hospital
