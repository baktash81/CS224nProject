now where is he  dennis 
all teams go to alpha  bring in the cube 
how did this guy get the name
 the breaker   is he a truck driver 
simple folkiore 
the locai color exorcising its demons 
maybe it s because he broke his victims
into as many pieces as possible

and what about you  kalina 
still carrying around
those ridiculous quicksilver flares 
you still have that quaint magicai book 
these aren t animals you re capturing 
they re human beings

maybe you should join greenpeace 
throw blood on old women s furs 
who are you to play god 
  playing is for children 
  you ll never pull it off 
not without the right spells 
that  and the thirteenth ghost 
thirteenth ghost 
get them out of my sight 
we ve wasted too much time already 
why did he say thirteenth 
move the cube into position

you contracted me for 12 ghosts 
the breaker is 12 
i m done after tonight  cyrus

my sole beneficiaries 
i ve instructed my lawyer  mr  moss   
   to deliver the essential elements
in my last will and testament 
give it to them  ben

it is a one of a kind home 
it s my home  actually 
my home 
i have no complaints 
i ve led an interesting life 
i have seen some amazing things 
but the only regret i have  is that
i never got to know my nephew arthur   
   nor appreciate the love of a family 
like you have 
this house is my attempt
to make up for that 
enjoy 
perhaps we ll meet again   
   in another life

many people died
in the quest for this book 
it was written in the 15th century
by an astrologer named basileus 
in it  he describes
the making of a certain machine 
one that can see into the future 
he wrote it while he was under
demonic possession 
i can t believe cyrus built it 
built what  what are you talking about 
basileus s device 
we re in the middle of a machine  designed
by the devii and powered by the dead 
listen to me 
i don t give a shit about any machine   
   or devii or basileus or anything   
   except getting my family
the hell out of this place 
i came here
to set the souls in this house free 
you want help  you have to help me first

it was his uncle that built the house 
you helped him  how could you help him
without knowing what he was doing 
  i had my reasons 
  money  you parasite 
you stole people s souls for money 
how depraved is that 
if you haven t noticed  i m a bit of a freak 
i come within 10 feet of anything dead 
i go into seizures 
i touch somebody  a whole life full of shit
flashes in front of my eyes 
so  yeah  i m depraved 
but cyrus was my friend 
and he accepted me 
he didn t accept you  you re so pathetic 
  he used you 
  shut up  both of you 
cut him some slack 
what difference does it make 
you didn t tell him  did you 
tell me what  what now 
about the fourth ghost

he has a right to know 
what about the fourth ghost 
st  luke s hospitai  six months ago 
you re saying my wife s spirit   
   is trapped in this house 
i didn t know you 
i didn t know her 
i didn t know she had a husband 
why  in god s name  why 
tell me  why her 
i don t know  cyrus handpicked them 
including your wife 
i figured out who you were
and i ve been trying to help you 
you call this help  she s right 
this is all your goddamn fault 
son of a bitch 
you can save her  and your kids  too 
just listen to me and believe me 
this house is not a house 
it is a machine 
a complete and faithfui re creation
of basileus s design 
according to this  there should be
12 earth bound spirits trapped inside 
see these 
they represent the black zodiac 
they represent the ghosts that
cyrus needed to catch  the first born son 
i don t want to play 
the torso 
the bound woman 
the withered lover 
jean 
bobby  i love you 
the torn prince 
the angry princess 
i m sorry 
the pilgrimess 
the great child and the dire mother 
the hammer 
and here  the sign of hell s winter 
the jackai 
and the juggernaut 
the machine required the energy   
   of these specific spirits
in order to bring it to life 
once it engages 
the spirits are released one by one 
the house then draws them to its center 
each one adds its energy to the machine 
powering it up 
powering it up for what 
to open the ocularis infernum 
what s that 
it s latin 
ocularis infernum  the eye of hell 
very good 
the eye of hell  i m stuck in a glass house
with crazy white people   
go on 
in hell  there is an eye
that sees everything  the past  the future   
   heaven and earth 
the blessed  the damned 
if knowledge is power 
then the man who controls the ocularis   
   would be the most powerfui
man on earth 
your uncle 
great 
so   
   how many ghosts have been set free 
eleven  and the house needs twelve 
no  damon said something about thirteen 
that there are thirteen ghosts 
the thirteenth ghost is a faii safe 
to stop the process  the house needs
a sacrifice of life instead of death 
a willing  human sacrifice 
a sacrifice of the broken heart 
the only ghost to be created
out of an act of pure love 
you re the thirteenth ghost 
the thirteenth spirit stands before the eye
at the finai configuration 
as the eye opens 
the spirit uses the power of life   
   to short circuit the system 
uses the power of life how 
by leaping into the eye 
and arthur s supposed to take this leap 
no fucking way  lady 
that s suicide  i won t let you do it 
you need to come up with something else 
that s not working 
love is the most powerfui energy 
meaning 
in order for you to save your children 
you must trade your life for theirs 
let me see this 
there s got to be a better way 
i don t read latin 
well  we can try it the old fashioned way 
my personai favorite 
nobody will be here
to brag about it afterwards 
we need to come up with
a game plan soon  time s running out 
are you going to blow the place up 
the last ghost is about to be released 
  i know why you feei you have to do this 
  get away from me 
psychics call it a  linking   
we linked earlier  i saw everything   
   about jean  about you 
shut up 
i m not going to listen to this from you 
kalina is talking about suicide 
anything to save my kids 
it doesn t add up 
it doesn t make any sense 
there s got to be a better way 
 doesn t add up  
what does add up here  dennis 
how much of this equation
makes any sense at all 
goddamn it  goddamn it 
aii i can think about are my kids 
i don t even know if they re alive 
then let s go out there and find out 
one last time 
while there s still time  you and me 
kalina   
   no matter what i decide to do 
or what happens to any of us   
   are you sure
you can you stop that machine 
i ve got enough explosives
to blow us back to the 15th century 
okay 
  how many flares do you have left 
  one  why 
we re going out again 
no fucking way  arthur 
you re going to get yourself killed 
not if we take that 
ten minutes
untii the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan

after you  captain america 
damn  i just got my nails done 
here  put these on 
come on  let s go 
 there s no place like home   
 there s no place like home 
there s no place like home 
 there s no place like home

i killed damon  i stole his spells 
i made sure your pathetic nephew
didn t get himself killed 
kalina 
where are the spells 
you re not mad at me  are you 
of course not 
  what is it 
  oh  shit 
there s only room for one of us 
what are you doing 
don t worry  i ve been looking for a reason
to like myself for a long time 
dennis  don t do this 
hey  bro  you ain t nothing but a bitch 
dennis  no 
oh  my god 
what do we do now 
your nephew believes
that sacrificing himself will save his kids 
but he won t do it
unless his kids are in jeopardy 
  well  put them in jeopardy 
  what 
  why not 
  but they re kids 
greatness requires sacrifice 
now  i have a job to do 
and so have you 
do it  do it 
yes 
and now to finish this 
oh  my god  jean 
i loved you so much 
i miss you 
miss you

this house is not a house  it s a machine   
   designed by the devil   
   and powered by the dead 
according to basileus  there should be
12 earth bound spirits trapped inside 
they represent the black zodiac 
they represent the ghosts
that cyrus needed to catch 
  the first born son 
  one 
  the torso 
  two 
  the bound woman 
  three 
  the withered lover

every waking moment  for years 
have you ever shown
that kind of dedication  have you 
the world has no time
for little people like you 
it needs people
who are willing to do anything 
anything for greatness 
you don t have a choice this time  arthur 
you will make that leap 
the machine requires
a ghost to be created   
   out of an act of pure love 
that s why i chose you  nephew 
you and your pathetic family 
make it stop  dad 
congratulations
