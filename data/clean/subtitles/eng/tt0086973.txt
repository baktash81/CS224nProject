the moonlight on the sea  
  might have been the warm
and friendly feeling everywhere  
  but something wild came over you and me  
  and we felt our inhibitions
melt away the snow  
  tthough we tried to fight it 
you and i  
  just about the time
discretion should have said hello  
  we watched our good
intentions wave goodbye  
  what if we both went
a little bit crazy   
  blame it on rio  
  what if our hearts got
a little bit hazy   
  blame it on rio  
  what if we acted like fools
broke a few rules   
  what do we care   
  blame it on rio
o    o    o    o     
  what if we both went
a little bit crazy   
  blame it on rio  
  what if our hearts got

  bum bum bum bum bum bum  
  la da da da da  
  bum bum bum bum bum      
what happened happened 
you just never know 
one time 
the company i work for transferred me
to an island in the pacific 
fantastic place 
i invited my girl to visit me 
i sent her a postcard
every day
with a single word
on each card 
i wrote   
 found a virgin paradise   
 it s yours   
matthew  
naturally  they were delivered
in the wrong order 
the message she got was   
 found a virgin 
 it s paradise 
yours  matthew  
i never heard from her again 
vacations are full of surprises 
to say nothing of virgins 
which brings me to last year 
it had been a really mixed up time 
just when i got to wear
a smaller retainer 
my parents filed for divorce 
kinda took the fun out of smiling 
i d been working in brazil
out of sao paulo 
the new york of brazil 
sao paulo is where
all the work gets done 
where all the fun gets done
is in rio 
which is where my wife 
karen  and i
decided to spend
our last vacation 
somehow  i d never made it there 
by all accounts 
it s the most exciting 
the most sensuous city in the world 
i didn t know
if this was actually true 
but after 20 years of marriage 
any fantasy helps 
victor was coming along 
of course 
that s my friend 
victor lyons 
he was going through
a bad patch at the time 
this divorce is going to kill me 
phone calls  letters 
look at this 
from her lawyers 
every day something 
if i don t get a letter 
i get a telegram 
we re in more contact apart
than we ever were together 
who knows 
maybe  the divorce
will save the marriage 
bite your tongue 
just one day in rio 
you ll forget all about it 
  i promise you 
  tell you the truth 
if it wasn t for jennifer 
i wouldn t even go 
i don t have to leave town
to be miserable 
it s much cheaper
doing it at home 
when does she get in 
she s on a 3 00 flight 
imagine what all this
is doing to the kid 
she ll be all right 
kids are survivors 
pays to survive  huh 
half 
that s all she wants 
half of everything i got 
wish i had herpes 
  i say to myself
she likes  em  
  handsome and tall  
  i had to admit  
  that i m not like that at all  
  i still don t know what
drew her to me overnight   
  jennifer 
  hi 
let me look at you 
you you re gorgeous 
  so are you 
  yeah 
well  what happened 
you    you re almost a woman 
i m strong  too  daddy 
i won t break 
oh  yeah 
right  sure 
look  let me take your things 
  did they feed you 
  uh huh 
you must be beat 
give   
give me your purse
this is some radio 
you can get a hernia
from rock and roll 
poor daddy 
i wanted to tell him
he didn t have to feel so guilty 
but  i just couldn t take
that happiness away from him 
my folks were married
almost 50 years 
never said a harsh word 
never said a kind word 
they just didn t speak
is what it was 
and i swore it would be
different for karen and me 
but  something was happening
to our marriage 
nothing earth shattering 
just small signs
that a husband can detect 
karen   
karen  what s wrong 
nothing is wrong 
read your book 
but you re crying 
i ll try to do it softly 
is it something i did 
it s nothing you did 
you would have to do something
for it to be something you did 
hold it  hold it 
do you have room for these  mom 
put them in dad s 
wait a minute 
you ve got more room than i 
don t be such a baby 
nicole is my daughter 
she also acts as
a sort of branch wife 
this bag s a mess 
thank you 
darling 
would you like me
to teach you how 
jennifer

but why

ah  that s only
when i m with you 
most of the time 
we re too together 
sometimes we re so us 
i forget what it s like
just to be me 
but when we re apart 
i i miss you terribly 
karen   
the truth 
is there someone in your life 
there s no one in my life 
no one

  a new world in the making  
  tonight alone with me

  so for now i couldn t      
to  uh   
the 2 people
closest to my heart 
the 2 people who
make me feel that  uh   
well  i must be worth something 
because if uh

good night  uh  sweetheart 
good night  daddy

ok 
you  too 
there s nothing to smile about 
this will give us a chance to straighten
this thing between us out
once and for all 
jennifer 
are you listening to me 
what 
i was just remembering
the first time i kissed you 
it was at your christening 
your mother was powdering your bottom 
and i said i wanted to be
the first man to kiss it 
and i leaned over 
and i did 
how dare you drive
a tiny baby wild with desire 
oops 
they happen to use these
for birth control 
which one of us wears it 
  i must be doing something right  
you should wear
your hair like this 
  what time is it 
  about 1 00 
i like it like this 
it makes you look older 
it s almost 3 00 
pretend it s 1 00 
we ve done too much
pretending lately 
you have to go 
let me stay 
we don t have
to make love again 
i promise not to get you excited 
i ll just bite
your neck a little 
jennifer 
meanie 
i ve never spent the whole night
nicky must be home by now 
you always have to
worry about something 
your father told me
about your pact 
which pact 
my father just loves pacts 
he said you d tell him
that if you and a boy
ever  um   
 ever  um  
do you think i d  um 
with a boy 
do you think
i m that kind of girl 
i just promised daddy
to make him feel better 
i never meant
to really tell him 
you ve got us both wrapped around
your little finger  haven t you 
i love you 
i can t think of a time
when i ever didn t 
jennifer  it s late 
and i love it when
your glasses steam up 
only when i m with you 
you know what i used to
pretend when i was little 
i m afraid to guess 
that we were married 
you and me 
when i was 10 
and i was only 90 
it would be lovely 
being married 
jennifer 
married people do not
go around getting married 
then maybe just a honeymoon 
off you go 
off to bed 
it took whatever strength i had
to send her away 
that s not altogether true 
if i really had any strength 
she never would ve been there at all 
jennifer 
  you all right 
  i m fine  daddy 
how come you re up so late 
how come you are 
touché 
  good night  sweetheart 
  good night  daddy 
p u 
cigar 
nicky 
do you hate me 
no 
him 
does he tell you
he loves you 
no 
you ll get used to it 
if you want a man
to love you 
you must light many 
many candles
and give gifts
to the goddess iamanja 
the goddess iamanja 
throw flowers into the sea 
white ones 
if they come back 
it means she has rejected them 
if not  she has listened
to your prayer 
i ll do it 
and here   
have him wear this always 
you love me 
the flowers didn t come back 
you love me 
i want to tell the whole world 
i m so happy 
the flowers didn t come back 
you love me 
you love me 
you love me 
jennifer 
for god s sake 
here 
  what s this 
  it means you re mine 
you know what love really is 
it s like you swallowed
a great big secret 
a warm  wonderful secret
that nobody else knows about 
and that s how it should be 
other times  though 
it s more like a song 
a song you want to sing
at the top of your voice
for everyone to hear 
uh  no  no  no 
it s more like a secret 
believe me  it is better
as a secret than a song 
matthew   
yes 
i ve never called you
matthew before 
no  uncle  
just plain matthew 
do you love me  matthew 
i do 
honestly 
yes 
secretly but honestly 
no more secrets 
  you have to tell daddy 
  i can t 
it would  it would kill him
if he didn t kill me first 
what s killing is you can
feel one way and love another 
there is just no way
we can bring this
out into the open 
who would understand 
i m not sure i do 
it s over  jennifer 
it has to be 
i won t let it be 
lunch  everyone 
it was just what i needed 
a one inch god
with a 2 inch penis 
aahhh 
ohhh 
ohhh 
are you all right 
somebody has put
these candles outside my   
jennifer    
i don t know what witchcraft
brought us together 
but it won t keep us that way 
can t you give it a little time 
i m lying to enough people now 
i don t want you
to be one of them 
it s not easy for me  either 
so  please  let us both
accept that it s over
before you set fire to me 
  misunderstood  
  we re hurtin   
  love was our crime  
  fixed what we could  
  but it takes time   
jennifer 
what s wrong 
where are you going 
jennifer 
  for all the wounds heal  
  when we just speak   
thank you sweetheart 
hmm

but i have to go first 
matthew 
i need you 
i i couldn t refuse 
i    i was his best friend 
and he needed my help 
my help 
it was like asking an arsonist
to become the fire chief 
it s my fault 
the whole thing 
if i d been around more 
if not for the divorce 
it never would ve happened 
the guy s a father figure 
that s all 
it s classic  you know
what i m talking about 
yep 
the kid s got such good instincts 
she feels she s gonna
protect the son of a bitch 
oh  i have to admire that 
yeah 
but  i can t leave it like this 
i ve gotta know who he is 
it s gotta be you  matthew 
what 
she loves you 
she trusts you 
take her out  will ya 
maybe she ll
tell you something 
this was it 
the moment had come 
i summoned all my courage 
  victor   
  what 
where shall i take her 
first he said it was over 
then he asked me to lunch 
it was like taking crazy 1 and 2 
but i didn t care 
i was so happy  i wanted
to give him a present 
something no one else
in the world could give him 
  what if we both went
a little bit crazy   
  blame it on rio  
  what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy   
  blame it on rio  
  what if we acted like fools   
  broke a few rules  
  what do we care  
  blame it on rio   
it s for you 
are you mad 
i can t keep this 
don t you like it 
i think it s pretty 
get outta there 
maybe i ll sell it at school 
better put it away before
they re selling it all over tokyo 
yes  uncle matthew 
i wish that s all i was again 
i truly do 
no  you don t  or you would ve
never asked me out for lunch 
do you know why we re here 
i m supposed to find out
who your lover is 
before it drives
your father crazy 
poor daddy 
yours or nicole s 
  mine 
  oh  that poor daddy 
you can t swing a dead cat around here
without hitting a poor daddy 
what are you
going to tell him 
he s my friend 
i ll have to lie 
i ll say that you
wouldn t tell me
who your decrepit
married old man is 
but  you promised
it was all over between you 
then you would be lying 
it s never going to be over 
can t you understand 
i m going to love you forever 
you have got
to stop using words
like  forever  and  married  
  why 
  because i happen to be one 
and we can never be the other 
jennifer  darling 
even if it was possible for us   
i mean 
everyone else aside   
you keep forgetting
the difference   
i know  you re a thousand years old 
it doesn t matter 
jennifer   
you can call me
darling if you like 
it doesn t matter now 
but when you re my age 
do you know what i ll be 
dead  i suppose 
dead and a half 
chaplin and picasso married
much younger women 
who  in turn  became
much younger widows 
i d rather spend a few years
with the man i love
than a lifetime
with someone i don t 
well  if you re going to use logic 
i ll lose my advantage
i like it when
you treat me like a woman 
i mean  outside of bed 
eat your meat 
so much for that treatment 
don t you know any boys
your own age you like 
i don t like boys 
you would if
you gave them a chance 
you said  hello  to him before 
he looks a decent sort 
clean cut 
the kind that calls
your father  sir 
and tries to chew
the rivets off your jeans 
age doesn t matter 
i m going to die young anyway 
look how short my life line is 
that s all rubbish 
i practically don t have one at all 
that s not your life line 
that s your heart line 
teeny little thing  isn t it 
you used to hold my hand
before we were lovers 
see how it works 
bernardo 
he s 19 
is that what you had in mind 
19 is perfect 
i ve been 19 a couple
of times myself 
do you really
want me to 
go ahead 
he was just what
i said she needed 
young  uninvolved 
uncomplicated 
i couldn t have been happier 
except for a sudden throb
in my temple   
that went all the way
down to my heart 
she wouldn t tell you
anything about him 
i m sorry  victor 
not a hint 
not a clue to who
the guy might be 
all she said was that
he was confused 
about what 
between his feelings for jennifer
and his feelings for his wife 
now he thinks of his wife  right 
i don t think the poor bastard ever thought
he d get so emotionally involved 
poor bastard  huh 
if i get my hands on him 
i ll beat him to death 
that ll unconfuse him 
a beating is not
the way  my friend 
he s right  you know 
personally  i prefer torture 
what s the matter 
i think i m getting strep throat 
i have to get in early 
thanks for tonight 
did you tell him 
nope 
well  good night 
is that jennifer 
uh  yeah 
is she all right 
how d she look 
quite beautiful  actually 
she is  isn t she 
i think so 
just like her mother 
another one of my screwups 
it takes two  victor 
not to screw up 
first my marriage 
now my kid 
what do i blow next 
our friendship 
if i ever lost that   
i mean  if i ever blew it
between you and me 
that d be it 
victor  there there s something
i ve got to tell you 
i can t bear
to see you this way 
  me  neither 
  no  no  let me finish 
we came here
to have a good time 
and all i ve done is
burden you with my problems 
oh  that s not true 
you re a rock 
my whole crappy life is
in chaos as a storm 
and you re the one rock right
in the middle of it i can cling to 
you re a rock 
not entirely  victor 
i mean 
i m not all rock 
i m not worthy of you 
i m not worthy of anybody 
victor  victor 
you can t 
this isn t for me 
what do you think i m crazy 
this is for him 
i m gonna find him 
and whoever he is

they re all hard in a way 
she ll get over you 
just be yourself 
i had to admit 
jennifer had gotten
under my skin 
i had no one
to turn to for advice 
what i needed was
objective professional help 
the more trouble
in heart and mind 
the more candles you must burn
for the help of the gods 
how young is the girl

ah  romance was in the air 
birds  music 
dancing  drums 
everything at once 
blame it on rio  eh 
i wasn t thinking
what i was doing 
you understand 
it s only when a man is not
thinking of what he s doing
that you can be sure
he s doing what he s thinking 
thanks 
you were by my side the whole time
we were looking for him 
what a horse s ass
you must have thought i was 
i i didn t have the courage 
who asked you
for the courage now 
why d you have to tell me 
in spite of it all    
i m your friend 
if you were really my friend 
you would ve kept quiet
about what you did 
which you never would ve done
if you were really my friend 
hit me 
please 
will you really
feel worse if i don t 
terrible 
good night  matthew 
  wrong is the urge
that i feel to be simple  
  when the light falls just right  
  and her eyes are inviting me  
  and who in the world
is immune  
  to the sensual moon  
  chills up my spine tell me
i m just the victim  
  without hope to resist  
  it s a fever that tears me down  
  and if by some chance  
  they should happen
to stumble on a cure  
  don t tell me  
  once temptation gets the best  
  of me  
  will these restless feelings stir  
  there s trouble  
  once temptation
gets the best  
  of me  
  then i m helpless next to her  
  chills up my spine tell me
i m just the victim  
    without hope to resist  
  psst 
    it s a fever that tears me down      
  matthew 
i want to talk to you 
  did you tell him 
  yes 
oh 
why aren t you in bed 
i was just going 
go to sleep 
come on 
come on down 
careful 
careful 
quick  get in the car 
come on 
  where are we going 
  nowhere  get in 
you really told him 
i m so proud of you 
you re probabl
y the only one who is 
oh  matthew 
wait  wait 
it s got to stop 
really 
we can t go on 
not a minute longer 
but now that he knows   
but  it only makes our relationship
even more impossible 
stop hiding behind words
like  relationship  
we re in love 
you said 
i was hoping 
in my usual dumb fashion
that whenever it ended 
it would be without
your father ever knowing 
but now he does   
must be nicky 
i m too old for this 
hiding in front seats
like a teenager 
next thing you know 
my skin ll be breaking out 
if this doesn t kill
your respect for me   
nothing can 
you didn t really
mean what you said 
please  don t 
that s only going to work   
and it can t 
matthew   
good night 
matthew   
i love you so 
jennifer

my mind to give her up

you bet your ass you are 
but i can t 
i care for her too much 
why the hell wouldn t you 
she s adorable  she s sweet 
 she s smart   she s innocent 
mostly 
you d have to be even more senile
than you are not to care for her 
i am not senile 
i m crazy about her 
what the hell are you doing 
asking for her hand 
with this teething ring 
i thee wed 
is that it 
you want permission to marry 
if you ask your wife first 
i think that s better manners 
  victor 
  hey  but wait a minute 
if she says no  maybe you
and karen could adopt jennifer 
i could still see her  of course 
i could baby sit for you 
she is a woman  victor 
she s very mature 
too bad we can t say
the same thing about you 
i love her 
it s as simple as that 
sure  you do 
what else can you say  huh 
i m serious 
i never thought i could
care this much again

oh  i know 
it s just a gift 
is that your composition  dear 
 what i did on
my summer vacation  
  karen 
  i came here as fast as i could
because i thought
you needed me 
you didn t need me 
you were fine 
a fantasy come true 
gidget goes to rio 
and what the hell
is wrong with you 
  were you blind 
  i had no idea 
they were alone 
i was out every night 
oh  really 
no big deal 
just uh for dinner 
i m sure 
why do you have
to explain to her 
i don t 
really 
exactly  what you do
is none of my business 
what you do is 
but it s important
that you understand   
victor  victor 
this is between matthew and me 
i m not just an outsider here 
right now you are 
victor  you have
every right to be hurt 
i i know how much
you love her 
who said i love her 
victor 
are you saying
you don t love jennifer 
of course i love jennifer 
what do you take me for 
who did you think i meant 
what s going on here 
i ve wanted to tell you  matthew 
it s what i went away
to think about 
tell me what 
  we re in love 
  no  we re not 
what do you mean 
 we re in love  
what do you mean we re not 
quiet  both of you 
i can t lead a double life 
you had that kind of marriage  victor 
i don t 
are you two
having an affair 
were 
were having an affair 
you and victor 
what s even worse 
victor and you 
he s offended 
mr  clean 
no wonder you were so upset
she wasn t coming 
more upset than you 
so preoccupied all the time 
so injured  so self righteous 
sleeping with someone else s wife
doesn t count  it s that it 
at least your wife isn t
anybody s daughter 
matthew  how could you 
how could i 
mom 
nicky  darling 
how could you 
we were in love  that makes
the hell of a difference  buddy 
  love 
  we weren t just looking for a thrill 
is that why you did it 
listen to this   
 matthew dearest 
i don t want to go on without you 
 i ll dream of you eternally  
the last time we were
together like this 
we were waiting
for her to be born 
victor 
as strange as it may sound 
i love you 
  senhor lyons 
  yes 
we ve done all we can 
she s out of danger 
thank god 
i had no idea
she had any sleeping pills 
how many did she take 
none 
none 
your daughter took
an overdose of   
birth control pills 
that s not a problem  is it 
she s not gonna grow a beard
or anything like that 
no 
is she allowed visitors  doctor 
one  perhaps  and   
for just a moment 
hello  aunt karen 
the doctor said
you re going to be fine 
they pumped my stomach 
mmm 
i m not on any kind
of machine  am i 
believe me  jennifer 
there s not a plug
in here worth pulling 
all you need is rest 
i ve got some sleeping pills
if you d like 
you re angry 
no 
it ll take a while
to be angry 
i ve got to get over furious first 
you little shit 
when you get older 
and obviously
you re going to get
a second chance at that 
you ll find you can t have
whatever you want 
and there s a price
for everything you get 
and sometimes 
other people have to pay it 
he loves you 
he told me 
that you talked together
bothers me more than anything 
it s all my fault  really 
he never had a chance 
men seldom do 
please   
don t hate me 
it s more like envy 
  karen 
  go away 
nicky 
go away 
this is a recording 
what do you want 
there s no other bed 
  bastard 
  prick 
and to think
i said i love you 
  to who 
  to you 
you love anything
that stands still 
unlike some people i know 
screw you 
bloody hypocrite 
i used to feel guilty
about me and karen 
just don t think that my being
with jennifer lets you off the hook 
move over 
you don t deserve her 
you know that  don t you 
  which one 
  both 
  either 
  neither do you 
tough 
karen s not going back 
like hell she isn t 
i thought
you wanted jennifer 
give me some 
give me half 
half 
you want half 
who are you 
my goddamn wife 
what  you wanna be
jennifer s mother  too 
stop throwing
jennifer up to me 
and you can stop pretending
you ve got some kind
of moral superiority
because you are a fraud 
no wonder you wouldn t
hit me when you found out 
still want me
to hit you  huh 
yeah 
how about now 
fine 
get up so i can kill you 
come on  you don t

  why don t you shut up 
aah 
ohh 
  watch it  those are my balls 
  are you kidding 
i couldn t find them
with a magnifying glass 
it was quite simply
the worst night of my life 
my embarrassment
compounded by the fact
that victor had now slept with 2
out of the 3 members of my family 
jennifer  i was just
gonna pick you up 
i got a ride 
lorenzo drove me 
you all right 
how do you feel 
fine

ok  ok  i better go call
the airlines and tell them

except for me 
the odd man out 
well  no complaints 
i made my own bed 
i just never thought
i d wind up in it alone 
uncle matthew 
you were right  you know 
i can t imagine about what 
that was a dream
i had on the beach 
a beautiful dream 
will you forget me 
the minute i die 
i m serious 
i don t know when 
your own divorce and
you don t know when 
i can get it tomorrow if
i want to cave in to her lawyers 
otherwise 
it s gonna take months 
months 
at least 
and then 
it ll be over 
i ll be free 
mmm 
just about the time
i could be 
yeah 
careful  victor 
don t let your enthusiasm
run away with you 
karen  we don t want
to rush into anything 
not a second time 
certainly 
don t panic  victor 
i have no demands 
we helped each other
through a bad time 
can i still see you 
i don t think so  victor 
why not 
your fly is open 
not now 
just most of the time 
you going to sao paulo 
i guess 
i m going to bahia 
it figures 
my hotel room s paid for the month 
right 
what s victor up to 
he s packing 
mm hmm 
have you got room
in your bag for these 
don t you want them in bahia 
they re going to bahia 
i don t understand 
you re going to bahia 
we ve got a lot
to talk about  matthew 
do you want to talk 
you think i want
to throw 20 years away
just because of
your foolishness 
or mine 
karen   
it s going to be
a long haul  matthew 
there s an awful lot
for both of us to forget 
let alone forgive 
mm hmm 
no more  mmms   matthew 
i want you to talk to me 
reach down
in your feelings
and tell me what
you re thinking 
what you re afraid of 
i want you to stop
bottling it all up 
i ll do my best 
i ll take your worst  too 
just share with me

we better hurry 
victor    wait

nicky

i know 
i m so glad you re leaving 
i ll see you back

goodbye  uncle victor 
goodbye  nick 
and uh   
thanks for whatever you did 
i didn t do anything 
thank god
somebody didn t 
goodbye  aunt karen 
goodbye  jennifer 
take care of yourself 
try not to play
with anything sharp 
we gotta move 
what s that 
  sunglasses 
  the other thing 
uh  i    i don t know 
nothing 
and i ve heard
all i want out of you 
go 
terrific 
i wind up being your driver 
i hope you re better at that
than being a friend 
you re kidding 
after what you ve done  i don t know
how you can look me in the face 
which one  victor 
which face did you
have in mind 
it s hard to realize  a whole year
has gone by since then 
victor finally got his divorce 
then he and his wife
turned around
and married each other again 
victor said it s because
she wanted to get the other half
of everything he owned 
with karen and me 
it wasn t really a case
of happily ever after 
we were lucky to get
any kind of ever after at all 
i figure   
we re a few months
away from happily 
but we ll make it 
you only live once 
but it does help if
you get to be young twice 
     moonlight on the sea  
  might have been
the warm and friendly  
  feeling everywhere  
  but something wild
came over you and me  
  and we felt our inhibitions  
  melt away as snow  
  though we tried to fight it  
  you and i  
  just about the time  
  discretion should have said hello  
  we watched
our good intentions  
  wave goodbye  
  what if we both went
a little bit crazy  
  blame it on rio  
  what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy  
  blame it on rio  
  what if we acted like fools  
  broke a few rules  
  what do we care  
  blame it on rio  
  what if we both went
a little bit crazy  
  blame it on rio  
  what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy
