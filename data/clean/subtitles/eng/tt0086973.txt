the moonlight on the sea
might have been the warm
and friendly feeling everywhere
but something wild came over you and me
and we felt our inhibitions
melt away the snow
tthough we tried to fight it
you and i
just about the time
discretion should have said hello
we watched our good
intentions wave goodbye
what if we both went
a little bit crazy
blame it on rio
what if our hearts got
a little bit hazy
blame it on rio
what if we acted like fools
broke a few rules
what do we care
blame it on rio
o o o o
what if we both went
a little bit crazy
blame it on rio
what if our hearts got
a little bit hazy
blame it on rio
what if we acted like fools
broke a few rules
what do we care
blame it on rio

what happened happened
you just never know
one time
the company i work for transferred me
to an island in the pacific
fantastic place
i invited my girl to visit me
i sent her a postcard
every day
with a single word
on each card
i wrote
found a virgin paradise
its yours
matthew
naturally they were delivered
in the wrong order
the message she got was
found a virgin
its paradise
yours matthew
i never heard from her again
vacations are full of surprises
to say nothing of virgins
which brings me to last year
it had been a really mixedup time
just when i got to wear
a smaller retainer
my parents filed for divorce
kinda took the fun out of smiling
id been working in brazil
out of sao paulo
the new york of brazil
sao paulo is where
all the work gets done
where all the fun gets done
is in rio
which is where my wife
karen and i
decided to spend
our last vacation
somehow id never made it there
by all accounts
its the most exciting
the most sensuous city in the world
i didnt know
if this was actually true
but after 20 years of marriage
any fantasy helps
victor was coming along
of course
thats my friend
victor lyons
he was going through
a bad patch at the time
this divorce is going to kill me
phone calls letters
look at this
from her lawyers
every day something
if i dont get a letter
i get a telegram
were in more contact apart
than we ever were together
who knows
maybe the divorce
will save the marriage
bite your tongue
just one day in rio
youll forget all about it
i promise you
tell you the truth
if it wasnt for jennifer
i wouldnt even go
i dont have to leave town
to be miserable
its much cheaper
doing it at home
when does she get in
shes on a 300 flight
imagine what all this
is doing to the kid
shell be all right
kids are survivors
pays to survive huh
half
thats all she wants
half of everything i got
wish i had herpes
i say to myself
she likes em
handsome and tall
i had to admit
that im not like that at all
i still dont know what
drew her to me overnight
jennifer

you can get a hernia
from rock and roll
poor daddy
i wanted to tell him
he didnt have to feel so guilty
but i just couldnt take
that happiness away from him
my folks were married
almost 50 years
never said a harsh word
never said a kind word
they just didnt speak
is what it was
and i swore it would be
different for karen and me
but something was happening
to our marriage
nothing earthshattering
just small signs
that a husband can detect
karen
karen whats wrong
nothing is wrong
read your book
but youre crying
ill try to do it softly
is it something i did
its nothing you did
you would have to do something
for it to be something you did
hold it hold it
do you have room for these mom

what
i was just remembering
the first time i kissed you
it was at your christening
your mother was powdering your bottom
and i said i wanted to be
the first man to kiss it
and i leaned over
and i did
how dare you drive
a tiny baby wild with desire
oops
they happen to use these
for birth control
which one of us wears it
i must be doing something right
you should wear
your hair like this
what time is it

i like it like this
it makes you look older
its almost 300
pretend its 100
weve done too much
pretending lately

to make love again
i promise not to get you excited
ill just bite
your neck a little
jennifer

worry about something
your father told me
about your pact
which pact
my father just loves pacts
he said youd tell him
that if you and a boy
ever um
ever um
do you think id um
with a boy
do you think
im that kind of girl
i just promised daddy
to make him feel better
i never meant
to really tell him

your little finger havent you
i love you
i cant think of a time
when i ever didnt
jennifer its late
and i love it when
your glasses steam up
only when im with you
you know what i used to
pretend when i was little
im afraid to guess
that we were married
you and me
when i was 10
and i was only 90
it would be lovely
being married
jennifer
married people do not
go around getting married
then maybe just a honeymoon
off you go
off to bed
it took whatever strength i had
to send her away
thats not altogether true
if i really had any strength
she never wouldve been there at all
jennifer

to love you
you must light many

jennifer darling
even if it was possible for us
i mean
everyone else aside
you keep forgetting
the difference
i know youre a thousand years old
it doesnt matter
jennifer
you can call me
darling if you like
it doesnt matter now
but when youre my age
do you know what ill be
dead i suppose
dead and a half
chaplin and picasso married
much younger women
who in turn became
much younger widows
id rather spend a few years
with the man i love
than a lifetime
with someone i dont
well if youre going to use logic
ill lose my advantage
i like it when
you treat me like a woman
i mean outside of bed
eat your meat
so much for that treatment
dont you know any boys
your own age you like
i dont like boys
you would if
you gave them a chance
you said hello to him before
he looks a decent sort
cleancut
the kind that calls
your father sir
and tries to chew
the rivets off your jeans
age doesnt matter
im going to die young anyway
look how short my life line is
thats all rubbish
i practically dont have one at all
thats not your life line
thats your heart line
teeny little thing isnt it
you used to hold my hand
before we were lovers
see how it works
bernardo
hes 19
is that what you had in mind
19 is perfect
ive been 19 a couple
of times myself
do you really
want me to
go ahead
he was just what
i said she needed
young uninvolved
uncomplicated
i couldnt have been happier
except for a sudden throb
in my temple
that went all the way
down to my heart
she wouldnt tell you
anything about him
im sorry victor
not a hint
not a clue to who
the guy might be
all she said was that
he was confused
about what
between his feelings for jennifer
and his feelings for his wife
now he thinks of his wife right
i dont think the poor bastard ever thought
hed get so emotionally involved
poor bastard huh
if i get my hands on him
ill beat him to death
thatll unconfuse him
a beating is not
the way my friend
hes right you know
personally i prefer torture
whats the matter
i think im getting strep throat
i have to get in early
thanks for tonight
did you tell him
nope
well good night
is that jennifer
uh yeah
is she all right
howd she look
quite beautiful actually

i mean if i ever blew it
between you and me
thatd be it
victor theretheres something

shell get over you
just be yourself
i had to admit
jennifer had gotten
under my skin
i had no one
to turn to for advice
what i needed was
objective professional help

in heart and mind
the more candles you must burn
for the help of the gods

hes doing what hes thinking
thanks
you were by my side the whole time
we were looking for him
what a horses ass

ii didnt have the courage
who asked you

about what you did
which you never wouldve done
if you were really my friend
hit me

feel worse if i dont
terrible
good night matthew
wrong is the urge
that i feel to be simple
when the light falls just right
and her eyes are inviting me
and who in the world
is immune
to the sensual moon
chills up my spine tell me
im just the victim
without hope to resist
its a fever that tears me down
and if by some chance
they should happen
to stumble on a cure
dont tell me
once temptation gets the best
of me
will these restless feelings stir
theres trouble
once temptation
gets the best
of me
then im helpless next to her
chills up my spine tell me
im just the victim
without hope to resist
psst
its a fever that tears me down
matthew
i want to talk to you

but it only makes our relationship
even more impossible
stop hiding behind words
like relationship

you said
i was hoping
in my usual dumb fashion
that whenever it ended
it would be without
your father ever knowing
but now he does
must be nicky

hiding in front seats
like a teenager
next thing you know
my skinll be breaking out

your respect for me

to be angry
ive got to get over furious first
you little shit
when you get older

youre going to get
a second chance at that
youll find you cant have
whatever you want
and theres a price
for everything you get
and sometimes
other people have to pay it
he loves you
he told me
that you talked together
bothers me more than anything
its all my fault really
he never had a chance
men seldom do
please
dont hate me
its more like envy

you think i want

for both of us to forget

goodbye aunt karen
goodbye jennifer
take care of yourself
try not to play
with anything sharp
we gotta move
whats that
sunglasses
the other thing
uh i i dont know
nothing
and ive heard
all i want out of you
go
terrific
i wind up being your driver
i hope youre better at that
than being a friend
youre kidding
after what youve done i dont know
how you can look me in the face
which one victor
which face did you
have in mind
its hard to realize a whole year
has gone by since then
victor finally got his divorce
then he and his wife
turned around
and married each other again
victor said its because
she wanted to get the other half
of everything he owned
with karen and me
it wasnt really a case
of happily ever after
we were lucky to get
any kind of ever after at all
i figure
were a few months
away from happily
but well make it
you only live once
but it does help if
you get to be young twice
moonlight on the sea
might have been
the warm and friendly
feeling everywhere
but something wild
came over you and me
and we felt our inhibitions
melt away as snow
though we tried to fight it
you and i
just about the time
discretion should have said hello
we watched
our good intentions
wave goodbye
what if we both went
a little bit crazy
blame it on rio
what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy
blame it on rio
what if we acted like fools
broke a few rules
what do we care
blame it on rio
what if we both went
a little bit crazy
blame it on rio
what if our hearts
got a little bit hazy
