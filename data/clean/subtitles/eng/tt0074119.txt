i finished it

 i finished it 
all right  give it to me 
i m just polishing it  i ll work the phones 
polishing it  yeah  you work the phones 
excuse me  i m sorry  who are the lawyers
for the five men arrested at watergate 
do you know 
 well  these two were assigned to it 
 i m sorry 
these two were appointed to the case 
but only now it turns out
the burglars have their own counsel 
 the burglars have their own counsel 
 that s right 
that s kind of unusual  wouldn t you say 
for burglars it s unusual 
 you know the name of the counsel 
 i don t know  some country club type 
judge  you are charged
with soliciting prostitution   
at 14th and east street 
and you get as your solicitor 
one perry woodstock 
your honor  mrs  hawkin has in the past
been a reliable  hardworking parent 
parents are sworn over 
i think  300 would be acceptable    
excuse me  what is your name 
i m bob woodward
of the washington post 
 markham 
 markham 
mr  markham  are you here in connection
with the watergate burglary 
i m not here 
okay 
well  clearly  i am here   
but only as an individual 
not as the attorney of record 
who is 
mr  starkey 
 do you have any  
 whatever you want   
you ll have to get it from him 
i have nothing more to say 
starkey  s t     
mr  starkey was very helpful 
four cuban americans
and another man  james w  mccord 
look  i told you inside 
i have nothing more to say 
i understand that 
what i don t understand is
how you got here 
i assure you there s nothing
very mysterious involved 
well  a little while ago  i was talking
to a couple of the lawyers   
assigned to represent the burglars 
so 
they never would have been assigned
to represent the burglars   
had anyone known the burglars
had arranged for their own counsel 
only  the burglars couldn t have arranged
for their own counsel   
since they never even made a phone call 
so  if no one asked you to be here 
why are you here 
i don t want you
to take this personally  mr    
 woodward 
 woodward 
it d be a mistake to do that 
i just don t have anything to say 
did one of the other men
involved in the break in call you 
what reason do you have to assume
that there were other people involved 
well  one of your clients
was arrested with a walkie talkie 
they re not my clients 
now  i don t want
to talk about this anymore 
you re a lawyer and you re here 
one of the defendants  mr  barker 
and i met at a social occasion once 
 where 
 i have nothing else to say 
a miami social occasion 
mr  starkey says
the cubans were from miami 
l 62  james mccord 
l 63  bernard barker 
l 64  virgil gonzales 
l 65  eugenio martinez 
l 66  frank sturgis 
please step forward  attorney starkey 
all charged with burglary 2 
 mr  starkey  will you represent all five 
 yes  your honor 
and are all five gentlemen charged
with burglary  second degree 
yes  your honor 
judge  your names  please 
and state your professions 
bernard barker  anti communist 
anti communist 
that  sir  is not your average profession 
james mccord  security consultant 
judge  where 
government  recently retired 
 where in the government 
  whispering  central intelligence agency 
where 
the cia 
sturgis  frank a   salvage operator 
holy shit 
eugenio martinez  known as gene valdez 
james w  mccord  alias edward martin 
frank sturgis  alias frank fiorini 
all five of them had at least one alias 
is there any proof they were trying to bug
the national democratic chairman 
it s obvious
they were trying to bug o brien 
they wouldn t go to all that trouble
to bug secretaries 
 there s no proof 
 wait a minute 
i called a lawyer in miami i know 
he said four of the guys
who were arrested were from miami   
gonzales  martinez  sturgis  and barker 
yeah  barker  and all four of them
were involved in cia activities    
 no  they weren t 
 yeah 
no  only one of them was admitted cia 
and the cia won t confirm that 
in fact  they deny even knowing mccord 
yeah  but i just think it s obvious that
with all that money and equipment   
they weren t out to work by themselves 
somebody hired them 
i m not interested
in what you think is obvious 
i m interested in what you know 
what we don t know is why they wanted
to bug democratic headquarters 
whether they were working
for themselves   
or other individuals or other organizations 
could be a story 
or could just be crazy cubans 
bachinski  when you get there tonight 
take it easy 
the police are nervous 
 telephone ringing 
yeah 
bachinski  calling from
police headquarters 
a friend just showed me
what they found in the hotel rooms   
of the watergate burglars

the most powerful man

howard hunt here 
hi  i m bob woodward
of the washington post

i was just kind of wondering
why your name and phone number   
were in the address books of
two of the men arrested at watergate 
good god 
do you care to comment 
in view that the matter is under
adjudication  i have no comment 
woman  hello 
this is bob woodward
of the washington post 
i was told that you had worked
with a mr  howard hunt 
why would anyone say that 
you do know mr  hunt 
no  i don t believe so  and i can t imagine
why anyone would say that 
listen  i m really sorry 
but i was on my way out  goodbye 
could we just confirm a couple     bye 
publisher  did you say
the washington post 
yes  that s right  the post 
your publishing firm was listed in some
papers in connection with a howard hunt 
yeah  he s one of our authors 
he wrote spy novels  i think 
what type of spy novels were they 
were they modern  or were they period  
you say   wrote   you mean
he s no longer with you anymore 
no  not at this time 
how long has it been
since you ve heard from him 
a couple of years  i think 
could you tell me some of the names
of the novels that he has written 
bob  hello  is this mr  paul herrera 
man   in spanish   quién 
this is bob woodward
of the washington post 
bob woodward of the    
do you speak english 
 man speaking in spanish 
 in spanish  momento  momento 
do any of you guys speak english 
do any of you guys speak spanish 
 man rambling in spanish over phone 
 señor 
 sí 
 speaking in rustic spanish 
never mind  thank you 
thank you  never mind 
 hello 
 mr  bennett 
 yes 
 this is bob woodward   
of the washington post 
sorry to bother you at home 
i was wondering
if you could confirm some information   
on one of your employees 
mr  howard hunt 
what kind of information 
it s just profile information mostly 
we know  for example 
that he works for mullen   company   
or did work for mullen   company
as a writer  he s also a novelist 
we know that he works in the office of
mr  charles colson at the white house 
and the cia 
and the cia 
if you re conducting
that kind of investigation   
then certainly it comes as no surprise
to you that howard was with the cia 
no  no surprise at all 
hunt worked for the cia till 1970 
from  49 to  70 
now  this is on deep background   
but the fbi thinks
he s involved with the break in 
what else you got 
according to white house personnel   
hunt definitely worked there
as a consultant for colson 
that s charles colson 
the president s special counsel 
did you call the white house press office 
i went over there  i talked to them 
they said hunt hadn t worked there
for three months 
then a pr guy said this weird thing to me 
he said   i m convinced
that neither mr  colson   
 nor anyone at the white house   
 had any knowledge of
or participation in   
 this deplorable incident
at the democratic national committee  
 isn t that what you d expect them to say 
 absolutely 
so 
i never asked about watergate 
i simply asked what were hunt s duties
at the white house 
they volunteered he was innocent
when nobody asked if he was guilty 
be careful how you write it 
looks like we ve got a white house
consultant linked to the bugging 
harry  this isn t a police story anymore 
this is national 
we need a top political writer on it 
well  they don t want it 
they re all over the goddamned map
covering the primaries 
besides  this guy has busted his ass 
he s been on this paper
for only nine months 
 what s the matter with you 
 he s a humper 
what s he been writing about 
rat shit in restaurants 
 he s got no experience 
 he got a few of them closed  didn t he 
minor incidents 
small government agencies 
have mr  moffitt come in here  please 
and see if mr  bradlee s free 
i want ben to hear this 
sure moffitt ll want the story
for the national desk   
now that we ve built it into something 
even bernstein s busting his ass 
i read that cockamamie memorandum
he wrote on the break in 
all right  so some of it was bullshit 
what is the matter with you 
you told me yourself
you were going to fire him last month 
look  he wants on the story bad 
they both do 
he knows a lot of people 
howard  they re hungry 
you remember when you were hungry 
man  hello  can you get me nigel    
right away 
 how s it going 
 what are you doing 
 polishing it a little 
 what 
 polishing it 
 what s wrong with it 
nothing  nothing  it s good 
then what are you doing with it 
i m just helping  it s a little fuzzy 
may i have it 
i don t think you re saying what you mean 
i know exactly what i mean 
not here  i can t tell from this whether   
hunt works for colson
or colson works for hunt 
 may i have it  please 
 some of the conclusions  
 may i have it 
 yes  i m not looking for a fight 
i m not looking for a fight  either 
i m just aware of the fact that
you ve only been here nine months 
what s that got to do with anything 
i ve been in the business since i m 16 
what are you saying 
i m trying to tell you that
if you d read mine and then read yours    
 may i read yours 
 yeah 
i walked by  gave yours a glance 
it didn t look right   
so i just figured i d refine it a little 
the first paragraph
has to have more clarity   
if the reader s going to understand it 
you don t mention colson s name
till the third paragraph 
i think mine s better 
but you go ahead and read it 
if you think yours is better 
we ll give yours to the desk 
i ve got colson s name up front 
he s a white house consultant
and nobody knows it 
you re right 
yours is better 
if you re going to do it  do it right 
here are my notes 
if you re going to hype it 
hype it with the facts 
i don t mind what you did 
i mind the way you did it 
woodward  bernstein 
you re both on the story 
now don t fuck it up 
carl  steuben  what s the name of
that girl that you bombed out with   
 that works in colson s office 
 sharon lyle 
sharon  why are you looking at me
like that 
carl  you re attractive 
you are very attractive 
you know  my girlfriend told me
to watch out for you 
 who 
 i m not giving any names 
steuben said you worked for colson 
steuben s crazy 
i never worked for colson 
that s what he said 
i worked for an assistant 
colson was really big on secrets  anyway 
even if i had worked for him 
i wouldn t know anything 
did you know howard hunt 
didn t he work in the office 
yeah  i knew howard 
 nice 
 he s a nice person 
he s secretive  he is secretive 
but a decent man 
do you have any idea what he did 
the white house said
he was doing some investigative work 
what do you say 
 sharon chuckling 
 he was doing investigative work 
 on what 
 different things 
 like what 
she warned me 
i m not going to take my book out 
i m just asking you 
the scuttlebutt for a while was that
he was investigating kennedy 
go on 
the white house was real paranoid
about teddy kennedy 
i remember seeing a book about
chappaquiddick on his desk 
and he was always getting material
out of the white house library   
and the library of congress 
and anything he could find 
receptionist  white house library 
hi  this is carl bernstein
of the washington post   
and i was just wondering
if you can remember   
any books that a howard hunt
checked out on senator kennedy 
 howard hunt 
 yes  ma am 
yes  i think i do remember 
he took out a whole lot of material 
 why don t you hold on and i ll see 
 i sure will  thank you very much 
 mr  bernstein 
 yes  ma am 
 i was wrong 
 i beg your pardon 
the truth is  i don t have a card
that says mr  hunt took any material 
i don t remember getting material for    
i do remember getting material
for somebody  but it wasn t for mr  hunt 
all right 
the truth is  i didn t have any requests
at all from mr  hunt 
the truth is  i don t know any mr  hunt 
i was just wondering
if you have any books     hello 
bob  yes 
we re checking that information now 
we d just like to find out
just what it was that hunt did   
when he worked out as a white house
consultant on the pentagon papers 
yes  i d appreciate that  if you could 
yes  sir  thank you 
i just got off the phone
with the white house librarian 
you want to look at the notes on it 
this is some stuff from
the eisenhower campaign in 1952   
that hunt was connected with 
did you call the
white house communications office 
no  i just got off the phone
with the librarian 
 524 743 
 i know the number 
between the first and second quote
there s a complete contradiction 
it s a space of about five seconds 
 my feeling is  
 was this all    
secretary  mr  clawson s office 
this is bob woodward
of the washington post 
 could i talk to mr  clawson  please 
 one moment  please 
thank you 
when she came back
she said she didn t even know  
 ken clawson 
 mr  clawson  this is bob woodward 
carl bernstein of the washington post
had a conversation   
with a white house librarian   
on some books a mr  howard hunt
took out on senator edward kennedy 
she first said that howard hunt
had taken out books on senator kennedy   
and then she denied even knowing
who he was 
i was wondering if you d like to comment
on this confusion 
listen  let me call you back on this matter 
 i m going to check on it for you 
 all right  thank you  bye 
 call back 
 yes 
 this was all one conversation 
 yeah 
she says first of all 
 i think i got a bunch of books on hunt  
she comes back five seconds later  she
says   i don t even know a mr  hunt  
it s obvious someone got to her 
not enough proof 
i mean  if there was just a piece of paper   
that said that hunt was taking out books
on kennedy and chappaquiddick 
like a     i don t know  library slip 
hunt also took out books
from the library of congress   
but what s more important is that
somebody got to her in that space of time 
 how do you know somebody got to her 
 because she said that hunt    
there was a lot of books
that hunt checked out 
and then she comes back
and she don t even know him 
 woodward 
 mr  woodward  ken clawson calling back 
 i ve just talked with the librarian 
 yes  sir 
she denies that the conversation
with mr  bernstein ever took place 
she said she referred him
to the press office 
excuse me  i m sorry  you say
she denies even knowing   
about the conversation taking place 
that s right  she said someone
did call her asking about mr  hunt   
but all she did was refer him
to the press office   
and she denies that   
 any other conversation took place 
 total bullshit 
 i hope that s been of some help to you 
 thank you 
 we ve got to get something on paper 
 the library of congress 
bob  mona 
excuse me  mona  could you take
any calls for me  please 
 sure 
 here s my note 
if i get any calls    
 will you be back later 
 i don t know when 
you want all the material
requested by the white house 
all white house transactions
are confidential 
thank you very much  gentlemen 
 we need a sympathetic face 
 we re not going to find one here 
you want every request since when 
carl  when did he start 
bob  july of  71 
carl  i imagine the whole last year 
i m not sure you want them 
but i ve got them 
maybe they pulled the cards 
maybe they changed the names 
there might have been a card there 
and we missed it 
hey  wait a minute 
i met a white house aide once
at a social occasion 
 so 
 he might confirm 
bob  do we need w h  in white house 
carl  not in the second paragraph 
 i don t think we do  do we 
 white house will be enough 
 white house 
 just use white house  forget the w h 
i want to know about colson 
what was his job at the white house 
 special consultant to the president 
 i gotta say it 
these notes on the white house librarian 
are they accurate 
the white house librarian 
the notes  are they accurate 
yeah  but i wanna hear him say it 
 okay  let s have it 
 here you are  ben 
it s a good  solid piece
of american journalism   
that the new york times doesn t have 
you haven t got it 
a librarian and a secretary saying
hunt looked at a book 
that s not good enough 
a white house aide told me
that hunt was investigating kennedy 
who was it 
who was it 
you want the name  you mean 
no  how senior  how high up 
i don t know titles 
 showed a special interest  
no  we said the white house
was investigating kennedy 
 showed a special interest in him  
jesus  the story s stronger than that 
the white house librarian says
hunt checked out a lot of books 
we got a secretary in colson s office
said hunt was sitting    
all right  carl  ben  that s a page 1 story 
stick it inside someplace 
this is a goddamn important story 
get some harder information next time 
asshole  bradlee s just sticking up
for the kennedys 
 we didn t have it  that s all 
 bullshit  we had it 
 no  we didn t 
 why didn t you say something 
do you think bitching about it is going
to get the story where we want it 
throw it in the can 
 phone ringing 
man  yes 
bob  this is woodward 
i want to talk about watergate  i know  
we re not going to talk about that subject 
 we talked about wallace 
 but this is different 
that was about the shooting
of a man running for president 
 this is different 
 how 
not about this story  don t call me again 
 news reporter on radio 
man  good luck  mr  president 
taxi 
 lighter flicking open 
 where are you 
 stuck 
the story s stalled on us 
and you thought i d help 
i ll never quote you 
i wouldn t quote you
even as an anonymous source 
you d be on deep background 
you can trust me  you know that 
go on 
 can you tell me what you know 
 you tell me what you know 
hunt worked for colson
at the white house 
hunt was investigating kennedy
at chappaquiddick 
that should tell you a lot 
what else 
we re beginning to hear a lot about
a lawyer at creep named gordon liddy   
who s    
 man whistling 
gordon liddy   
was fired by mitchell
because he wouldn t talk to the fbi 
 you ll hear more 
 will he talk 
i was at a party once  and   
liddy put his hand over a candle 
and he kept it there 
he kept it right in the flame
until his flesh was burned 
somebody said   what s the trick  
and liddy said   the trick is not minding  
the story is dry 
all we ve got are pieces 
we can t seem to figure out
what the puzzle is supposed to look like 
john mitchell resigns
as the head of creep   
and says that he wants to spend
more time with his family 
sounds like bullshit 
we don t exactly believe that 
no  but it s touching 
forget the myths the media s created
about the white house 
the truth is 
these are not very bright guys   
and things got out of hand 
hunt s come in from the cold 
supposedly  he s got a lawyer
with  25 000 in a brown paper bag 
follow the money 
what do you mean  where 
i can t tell you that 
but you could tell me that 
no  i have to do this my way 
you tell me what you know
and i ll confirm 
i ll keep you in the right direction if i can 
but that s all 
just follow the money 
carl  goddamn new york times 
bob  what is it 
phone calls from burglars in miami
to the committee to re elect 
fifteen phone calls 
at least 15 phone calls and those phone
calls were made as early as march 15   
which is a full three months
before the break in 
  89 000 issued in the name
of a prominent mexican lawyer  
 89 000 in mexican checks 
why didn t we get this 
who are their sources 
i even know someone
who works at the phone company 
carl  if john mitchell
wanted your phone records   
you d be running around yelling
invasion of privacy 
was the new york times article accurate 
 yeah  but i can t get you a fuller listing 
 why 
they ve subpoenaed
all of bernard barker s phone records 
i think they re trying to find out if the
watergate burglars broke any florida law 
 who subpoenaed them 
 miami da 
 what s his name 
 i don t know his name 
but  the guy who s heading
the investigation is named dardis 
dardis  what s his first name 
i don t know his first name 
i guess you ll have to find that out 
hi  i m carl bernstein  i have
a 9 15 appointment with mr  dardis 
yes  mr  bernstein 
i m afraid that mr  dardis   
won t be able to see you this morning 
his calendar is really quite full 
there must be a mistake  i made

bob  outside line  please 
operator  yes 
 thank you 
    the joint decision   
that we have reached tonight 
health would not affect 
but the public debate   
over senator eagleton s
past medical history   
continues to divert attention
from the great national issues   
that need to be discussed 
i have referred to
the growing pressures that ask   
for senator eagleton s withdrawal 
dahlberg  hello 
 could i please     mr  dahlberg

mr  bernard barker    
as you know  sir

the committee to re elect 
 yes 
 why would you do that 
i raise a lot of money 
i m midwest finance chairman 
for the committee to re elect

how do you think your check got into the
bank account of the watergate burglar 
i m a proper citizen  what i do is proper

 hello 
 yes 
this is bob woodward
of the washington post 
i just spoke to a mr  kenneth dahlberg   
who says that he is
midwest finance chairman 
yeah  i know ken dahlberg 
well  i can t seem to get an explanation
on why a check   
for  25 000 made out to mr  dahlberg   
that he apparently sent to the committee
to re elect the president   
would end up in the bank account
of a watergate burglar 
i don t know 
 but you re head of the committee  sir 
 look  i just came aboard 
john mitchell was the head
of the committee  he might know 
well  what would the explanation
possibly be  
i don t know 
you re implying that i should know   
and if you print that 
our relationship will be terminated 
sir  we don t have a relationship 
macgregor  the issues of the campaign
are peace and prosperity   
not a campaign check 
 bob 
 sir  no one is saying    
macgregor     this happened
before i came on board 
mr  dahlberg is on line 2 
i m running a campaign
for the re election of the president 
we ve raised  60 million
and you re asking about a  25 000 check

i m very sorry 
 yeah  okay 
 mr  dahlberg 
yes  i m sorry i hung up before 
i wasn t sure you were
a washington post reporter 
i believe we were talking about
a  25 000 check 
obviously this is difficult for me 
i m caught in the middle
of something and   
i don t know what 
what do you think it could be 
i deal with a lot of important people 
people who work
for the committee  hello 
for the committee 
 the committee to re elect the president 
 yes 
you see  i raised that money in cash   
and i have a winter home in florida 
 is that miami 
 boca raton   
and i didn t want to carry
all that cash around 
 now  you can understand that 
 of course i can 
so  i had it exchanged
for the cashier s check 
and how do you think
it got into barker s account 
i know i shouldn t be telling you this    
i gave it to mr  stans 
i beg your pardon 
i gave it to stans 
maurice stans 
 the head of finance for nixon 
 yes  in washington 
now what he did with it 
i really do not know

tv announcer     catapulted
the unknown senator from missouri   
into national prominence   
by naming eagleton as his running mate 
   bolstering of support
for the democratic ticket  
scott  what happened with that taiwan
thing you were telling us about 
japan is going to break diplomatic ties
with taiwan   
when they recognize red china 
the irony  of course  that s a
direct result of nixon s visit to china 
jesus  what did he tell them 
what did he say to them 
incidentally  that s a great parallel story   
if you re going to do that piece on détente 
right   queen elizabeth proclaims
a state of emergency   
 to deal with what we call a  dock strike   
breaking it off   
 all laughing 
i ll give you a human interest 
 thirty one days of rain
in the philippines   
 is being blamed on the theft
of a statue of jesus  
we had one like that before 
 i ll put my best writer on that 
 what about the one in lndia 
laugh  gentlemen 
it ll be the only story everyone reads 
okay  national 
we have the bremer diary 
 wish to kill nixon  
he took a car trip to new york 
ottawa  and washington to kill him 
we have the  senate approving
the abm treaty  
abm 
of course  we have
 mcgovern offering the vp spot    
to everybody 
 yeah  that s news 
 i have  
because everybody s been offered it 
now  i ll tell you what will be news 
when somebody accepts it  that s news 
here is some great art 
mcgovern and humphrey at breakfast 
smiling their asses off 
isn t that great 
 he says   i am george s friend    
 why is that man smiling 
sounds friendly  very friendly 
 i ll be helping him in ways
he never dreamed possible  
breakfast followed by lunch 
okay  metro 
well  we got the schoolteachers
on capitol hill 
they want a 17  increase in pay
or this fall they go on strike 
harry  i think we could mention
that this might be the time   
to go to the front page
on the district home rule 
 oh  come on 
 listen to him 
ben  this time it could go all the way 
the house is going to vote next week
on a senate resolution 
okay then  well  when they pass it 
we ll run with it 
okay  fellas 
let s go around again now  foreign 
taiwan emergency  philippines 
okay  fine  national 
i ll stand on the eagleton follow ups   
mcgovern not being able
to get a replacement 
he s offered it to humphrey  kennedy 
and ribicoff  all turned him down 
that s the page 1 lead right there 
you re ignoring the importance
of the dahlberg repercussions 
nobody cares about
the dahlberg repercussions 
now look  it was our story
that got the general accounting office   
to start an audit with creep finance 
we printed that didn t we  when the
frigging audit s done  we ll print that  too 
let me tell you what happened today 
i was having lunch
at the sans souci  and   
this white house guy  a good one  a pro   
came up and asked me   what is this
watergate compulsion with you guys  
compulsion  this is a story 
this is not compulsion 
i said   well  we think it s important  
and he said 
 if it s so goddamn important  who in
the hell are woodward and bernstein  
now  what do you expect him to say
from the white house 
 you re doing a great job  
why don t you ask him
what he s really saying 
he wants to take the story away
from woodstein and   
 give it to his national desk 
 at least i have   
some experienced guys sitting around
who know the politicians   
 who have the contacts 
 we re aware of that 
you said it  sitting around 
ben  it s a dangerous story for this paper 
 what if your boys get it wrong 
 then it s our ass  isn t it 
we all have to go out
and work for a living 
national gets eight columns 
nine for foreign 
metro  15 
that s it  fellas 
hey  scott  i need to see you 
how dangerous 
well  it s not just that we re using
unnamed sources that bothers me   
or that everything we print 
the white house denies   
or that almost no other papers
are reprinting our stuff 
what then 
look  there are over 2 000 reporters
in this town   
are there five on watergate 
where did the washington post
suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom 
why would the republicans do it 
mcgovern is self destructing  just like
humphrey  muskie  the bunch of them 
i don t believe their story 
it doesn t make sense 
yeah  bernstein 
now  all right 
woodward  bradlee will see us now 
answer the phone for me  will you 
are you trying to find the
lowest possible common denominator    
ben  it s the hottest item 
 it s in over 500 papers 
 what is it 
yesterday s weather report
for people who were drunk   
and slept all day 
jesus  send it out   
to the san francisco chronicle 
they need it 
 how about the crossword puzzle 
 no 
anagrams 
 no space  mickey 
 goodbye 
the last thing you bought
from me was the obituaries 
 make him buy something  will you 
 all right 
hey  what do you guys want 
the gao report s due out
the morning of nixon s renomination 
sit down 
well  that s two weeks from now 
since they re only responsible
to congress   
there s no way the white house
can control the investigation 
there s a source over
at general accounting that tells us   
there s a whole rat s nest
of illegal shit going on over at creep 
 like what 
 like a slush fund 
hundreds of thousands of dollars
of unaccounted for cash 
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
any comment from creep 
yes  unavailable for comment 
they re not talking 
but what else besides the money 
where s the goddamn story 
the money s the key to whatever this is 
 says who 
 deep throat 
 who 
 oh  that s woodward s garage freak   
his source in the executive  
garage freak  jesus  what kind of a crazy 
fucking story is this 
who did you say 
he s on deep background 
i call him  deep throat  
look  mcgovern s dropped to nothing   
nixon s guaranteed the renomination   
and the post is stuck
with a story no one else wants 
lt ll sink the goddamn paper 
everyone says   get off it  ben  
and i come on very sage   
and i say   you ll see 
you wait till this bottoms out  
but the truth is 
i can t figure out what we ve got 
what else are you working on 
we re after a list of creep employees 
 where is it 
 it s classified 
 how are you gonna get it 
 we haven t had any luck  yet 
get some 
anything else 
you made a mistake in there 
what 
you said to brad
that we haven t had any luck yet   
and that s the thing that he jumps on 
you can t talk about luck 
if you can t talk in specifics 
you shouldn t say anything 
is there any place you don t smoke 
 what 
 hold it

 hi  i m bob woodward 
 i m carl bernstein

 would you object to just  
 yes 
 hi 
miss milland  betty milland 
 i m bob woodward 
 carl bernstein 
we re from the washington post 
i know you re trying to do your job 
i mean    
you don t understand
the pressure that we re under 
it ll just take a couple of seconds 
if we can just come in for a couple of  
 no  i really don t  
 we don t want to come in 
we understand that there was
some documents   
that were shredded at the committee 
well  there    
there s often shredding  we do that a lot 
 were you there during the shredding 
 yes  i was 
i see 
were there any department heads from   
the committee who were also present 
yes  mr  mitchell came in one night 
john mitchell  the attorney general 
he was carrying a raincoat over his head 
i thought he was going to go    
did he supervise the shredding 
can i not answer any more questions 
i d just soon not    
okay  maybe i could call you 
 are you being told not to talk 
 will you call us 
i don t know 
i ll try 
what about all that shredding
that took place after the break in 
need to know more about the papers
that were in shredding 
i think you ve some idea
what s in the papers   
when the former attorney general
comes to the office   
when it s taking place
at the committee to re elect   
and got a raincoat over his head 
why s he in a raincoat 
could be raining
is what could ve happened 
let me go through the story again 
you got a woman who s frightened
at the door  works for creep 
she said there s shredding taking place 
we don t know what s in the papers 
we know the former attorney general
comes in with an overcoat over his head 
it could be raining 
there s a lawyer present 
we don t know what he asked them 
she wouldn t talk about it 
now  will you please tell me
where there s a story 
there s a story in the fact that the
interview did not take place in her home   
but in the office
of the committee to re elect 
how s there a story in that 
it s not enough 
there s a story
because there s a lawyer in the office 
 i mean  you re more resistant than she is 
 that s right 
 why 
 because there s not enough fact 
carl  let s just turn around and go back
and question her again 
 this won t take long at all  we just want  
 please go away  okay 
will you please leave before they see you 
 who did you mean by  
 who do you mean   they  
could you give us their names 
we haven t revealed the sources
of people that have talked to us 
you know  i really can t talk
about this because  
would  they  be members
of the committee 
carl  someone got to that woman 
it s the key to the whole cover up 
how can you write that
there s a cover up 
we don t know that there s a cover up 
well  then  i don t know
what the hell you need 
so  you tell me what you need 
i need more fact for a story
is what i need   
and i think you should
need the same thing 
okay  if you get in the car   
and there s music playing
in the car  hypothetically 
there s music playing in the car
for 10 minutes   
and there s no commercial 
what can you deduce from that 
 is it am or fm 
 come on  bernstein 
is it am or fm 
a guy can come up to me on the street
and he can ask me an address 
now  is the man interrogating me 
or is he lost 
what kind of a story do i write 
what kind of a deduction
do i make from that 
because you don t have a gut feeling
that the woman is trying to help us 
no  i don t have enough gut feeling
and i wish i did

 doorbell jingling 
hi  i m carl bernstein
of the washington post and   
i just want to ask you
a couple of questions 
well  you don t want me 
you want my sister 
it s for you  it s carl bernstein 
oh  my god  he s the guy from the post 
get rid of him 
could i just borrow one
of your cigarettes there 
sure 
you ve really got to go 
sure  could i just get a match 
i can understand your being afraid 
there s a lot of people
at the committee just like you   
who wanted to tell the truth
but some people wouldn t listen 
certain people have gone back
to the prosecutors and the fbi   
to give information
which they were never asked 
you were hugh sloan s bookkeeper when
he worked for maurice stans at finance   
and we were just wondering if you were   
promoted to work for mr  stans
immediately after mr  sloan quit   
or whether there was some time lapse 
i never worked for sloan or stans 
can i get you some coffee or something 
yeah  thanks very much 
 doorbell jingling 
door sticks 
could i just sit down for a second 
sure  you can sit down 
but i m not going to tell you anything 
okay 
i was just curious why you lied just then 
have you been threatened
if you tell the truth 
no 
never in so many words 
 how do you like it 
 just milk 
 thanks 
 okay  i ll just get that 
i saw in the wires
that mrs  stans was in the hospital 
is she feeling better 
the gao  the general accounting
report said that   
there was  350 000 in the safe of
the committee to re elect the president 
were you aware that it was that kind
of funds from the very beginning 
a lot of people are watching me 
they know i know a lot 
was it all in  100 bills 
a lot of it was 
i thought it was
an all purpose  political fund   
you know  for taking fat cats to dinner 
things like that 
 350 000 for dinners 
how was it paid out 
not in one big chunk 
there was a list of 15 names
and the amount of money   
given to each person next to the name 
what happened to the list 
it was destroyed  it was the only record 
don t pay attention to this 
this is for my memory 
i have a very bad memory 
you won t be quoted by name 
in fact  we get confirmations
before we print anything 
i can t be   
positive that that money was used
for the break in  you understand 
yes  i do 
 but  people sure are worried 
 which people 
think you could help me
with the disbursement of money   
in terms of the number of people
that were involved  how many 
a group of them  about five 
i don t know their names 
would mr  sloan know 
 would he  
 i don t want to say anymore  okay 
i won t be much longer 
i wondered if you could just
help me a little bit about   
the money  we hear all kinds of figures 
 there s so much of it 
 how much is  so much  
in one two day period   6 million came in 
 six 
 six million  cash 
we didn t know where to put it all 
i thought it was all legal 
i mean  i guess i did until   
after the break in when i remembered
gordon got so much of it 
 this is mr  liddy 
 it s all so rotten 
it s getting worse 
and the only one i care about
is hugh sloan 
his wife was going to leave him if he
didn t stand up and do what was right 
so  he quit 
i was wondering   
if hugh sloan was being set up now
as a fall guy for john mitchell 
what do you think 
if you guys could get john mitchell 
that would be beautiful 
coffee s cold 
is there any evidence that   
any of mr  mitchell s assistants   
were part of this 
i had all the evidence  it was destroyed 
i don t know who destroyed it 
 i think gordon did a lot of shredding 
 hard evidence 
well  i can t say that it would positively
prove that they planned the break in   
but it would come pretty close 
can you tell me anything
about who got the money 
we have   
had some help on this
from a couple of sources   
and this is a way of confirming it 
i don t want you to feel
that you re in a position   
where you have to disclose names 
i can just ask you initials   
and then that way you re not
divulging any information 
we have some idea 
would that be all right 
was there an  m  
can you just nod either way 
did it go that high up 
 l  
i don t want to say any more  okay 
i m sorry  you said  l    
or   i get confused 
could we just go back for a second 
in one six day period 
over  6 million came in 
you wouldn t believe what
was going on inside that woman 
the stuff was just ready to pour out 
i m pouring down cups of coffee
trying to get it out of her   
before she throws me out of the house 
 give me your notes so  
 these are the notes 
 these are the notes 
 i ve got stuff on napkins  matchbooks  
i m writing in the bathroom
while she s getting coffee 
 i m a walking litter basket 
 you re crazy 
you d be crazy  too 
if you were operating on 20 cups of coffee 
could you give me something
i can get down 
i got it  i got it all 
okay  write 
 mitchell was in control 
 wait a minute 
 there were men working under mitchell  
 how many 
i don t know how many 
but the men working under mitchell   
received the money from the slush fund 
do we know how much money 
we re talking about
hundreds of thousands of dollars 
and these men are the key
to what that money was used for 
boy  that woman was paranoid 
at one point  i suddenly wondered
how high up this thing goes   
and her paranoia finally got to me 
i thought what we had was so hot 
that any minute cbs or nbc   
would come in through the windows
and take the story away 
you re both paranoid 
she s afraid of john mitchell 
you re afraid of walter cronkite 
 right 
 can we go back to what she said 
here   l    p   and  m  
 what do you mean 
 it s  l    p   and  m  
 she d only give initials 
 lnitials 
the initials are the name of the men that
worked under mitchell   l    p   and  m  
you couldn t get the names 
if i could ve gotten the names 
i would ve gotten the names 
i m with the woman 
trying to get anything i can 
she said  l    p   and  m  
that s all she would give me   
are the people who worked under mitchell 
she said something about mitchell 
she hates him 
she said   john mitchell    
 if you guys could get john mitchell 
that would be beautiful  
wait a minute  what s this here 
what are you writing about sloan 
 sloan was the treasurer
of the committee to re elect 
 his wife is pregnant and she made
sloan quit because apparently   
 he no longer wanted to be a part of it  
we ve got to go see sloan 
okay  make a note of it 
so  what have we got 
where s that matchbook 
 here 
  l    p   and  m  
okay   l    p   and  m  
  l  could be la rue  it could be liddy 
  l  is liddy 
 how do we know that 
 because she said it 
right here 
she said   at the time of the break in   
 there was so much money
floating around   
 that i know gordon got part of it  
so i said   you mean gordon liddy  
she said   yes  
so   l  is liddy 
okay  that leaves  p  and  m  
 p  could be   
parkinson  it could be porter  it could be  
wait a minute  there was a guy once 
there was a guy we talked to last week 
didn t he say
that there was a bart porter   
who at one time was
a member of the committee to re elect 
porter was called before
the grand jury investigation 
so  p  is definitely porter 
 p  could be porter 
 p  is porter   l  is liddy 
all that leaves is  m  
 m  could be mccord  that s out 
it could be mardian 
it could be   
 magruder 
 i think it s magruder 
 i think it s magruder  too 
 why do you think it s magruder 
because he was second in command
under mitchell 
why do you think it s magruder 
because at one time
he was a temporary head   
of the committee to re elect 
before mitchell 
i don t want a cookie 
we ve got to get that bookkeeper
to say it was magruder 
never get her to say anything about  m  
we have got to go back there
and try to get her to say it 
if we could make names of the initials   
then we ll know the people at creep
who paid off the burglars 
we ll at least know who got the money 
the indictments that came down
from the grand jury today   
stopped   
with the five burglars  hunt and liddy 
carl  we have got to go back there
and get that bookkeeper   
to say who the names are and not initials 
she ain t going to give it to you   
because i was with the woman
for six hours 
 we have to try 
 then you ll have to trick her  threaten her 
 she s not going to do it 
 wait a minute 
 you know what we could do 
 what 
 listen  we go back there   
 yeah 
    and you ask her who  p  is 
 yeah 
and then i say   no  don t worry about it   
 we know  p  is porter   i just bury it 
okay  now  wait a minute 
i say to her   who is  p   
 and then you say to me  
 i say   no  we know  p  is porter  
 you mean  you try to fake her out 
 right 
 and what if she denies it 
 we re screwed 
 so 
 but if she doesn t  we know we got it 
 we know  p  is porter 
 try it 
hi 
they ll see you 
not if you let us in  they won t 
and i m bob woodward 
 they ll see your car 
 we parked around the corner 
you have answers
for everything  don t you 
if we did  we wouldn t be here 
you wrote what i told you 
oh  no  not your name 
no one knows it was you 
could you tell us who got the money 
and how much 
you mean like   what did you do
with the  25 000  lady  
what 
little jokes they re making
down at finance these days 
if people are to be convinced   
that stans and sloan are innocent 
then our reporting must be precise   
and you can help us 
who is  p  
 p  we know  is porter 
you said    25 000  
is that how much porter got 
was it more 
was it more than  50 000 
was magruder the only  m 
to receive money 
who told you about porter 
tv interviewer  i d like to move on now   
to the subject of the break in
at the watergate   
and the controversies
that keep coming up out of that 
it has recently 
very recently been reported now  that   
some documents were torn up   
at the committee
to re elect the president 
are you investigating the tearing up
of those documents  
attorney general  i think that came out
in a story in the washington post 
 yes 
 i think the investigation   
that has just concluded itself   
has probably been
one of the most intensive   
that the department of justice
and the fbi has ever been involved in 
some 1 500 persons were interviewed   
1 800 leads were followed 
333 agents were involved   
14 000 man hours   
fifty one of the 59 fbi field officers
were involved 
and that  i think   
is a great credit to justice in this country 
did you know
that documents had been destroyed 
no  i did not 
all these neat little houses
and all these nice little streets 
it s hard to believe that something s
wrong in some of those little houses 
no  it isn t 
 hello  i m carl bernstein 
 bob woodward 
we d just like to talk to mr  sloan
for a couple of minutes 
 he s resting right now 
 are you mrs  sloan 
 you re the two from the post  aren t you 
 yes 
this is an honest house 
that s why we d like to see your husband 
faced with certain criminal charges
that might be brought   
against some people that are innocent 
we just feel that  
it s really for his benefit 
no  it s not 
no  it s not 
sloan  deborah  tell them to come in 
thanks 
 hi  carl bernstein 
 how do you do  hugh sloan 
 bob woodward 
 how are you doing 
i appreciate you giving us the time 
you know  the reason
that we re here  basically   
is that we ve talked
to certain people who   
have indicated that the reason
you left the committee   
was because you no longer
want to be part of it 
yeah  right  maybe there s
a legitimate explanation   
why the money was handed
to liddy and mitchell s aides 
try to understand this 
 i m a republican 
 i am  too 
well  i believe in richard nixon 
i worked in the white house
for four years and so did my wife 
what happened on june 17  i don t
think the president knew anything about 
is it possible that some of his people
might have known 
i m not sure about that 
do you think the truth
will ever come out at the trial 
 that s another thing i m not sure about 
 why 
well  obviously  because certain people
lied to the prosecutor 
no 
we were never told flat out   don t talk   
but the message was clear  though 
in other words  by their very silence 
there was a cover up 
well  they didn t urge us
to come forward and tell the truth 
 they   meaning the white house 
well  the committee s not
an independent operation 
everything s cleared
with the white house 
and i don t think the fbi or
the prosecutors understand that 
that report on the cash   
in the creep safe  that  350 000 
 no  more 
 was that a correct figure 
no  it was closer to  1 000 000 
and  as treasurer 
you could release those funds 
when so ordered 
we don t know the names of the people
who could order you 
 we just know that there were four 
 no  there were five 
mitchell  stans  magruder 
they re obvious 
 there had to be a white house overseer 
 yeah  colson 
no  colson s too smart to get involved
directly with anything like that 
it s haldeman 
right 
i won t talk about the other two 
they both worked at the white house 
one of them did  the other one s not
in washington  but that s all i ll say 
 kalmbach 
 nixon s personal lawyer 
 right 
 nixon s personal lawyer 
i can t say anything  i m sorry 
 well    
 when s the baby due 
soon  next month 
 are you going to stay here 
 no  i don t think so 
decided where you re gonna go 
i ve been looking for a job
in the private sector  but it s    
it s very hard 
my name s been in the papers too much 
you know  one thing i m just
still not completely clear about 
when you handed out the money 
how did that work  exactly 
badly 
i think what bob means is  that
ordinarily  what was the procedure 
routine  i d call john mitchell
over at the justice department 
he d say   go ahead  give out the money  
this was all done verbally 
yes 
okay  we know there were five men
who controlled the slush fund 
mitchell  stans  and magruder 
yeah  those three we ve got  and all three
have been named by two sources 
what about the other two 
 kalmbach 
 we re pretty sure of kalmbach 
maybe we better wait
until we get all five  huh 
certain on mitchell 
we know that he approved payments
to liddy while he was attorney general 
 you ve got more than one source 
 yes  harry 
 who are they 
 sloan 
sloan and who else 
there s another guy at justice
who so far won t confirm   
the names of the others who
control the fund  we re working on it 
 what about deep throat 
 he s not a source on this 
 but do any of them have an axe 
 no 
personal  political  sexual 
 is there anything at all on mitchell 
 no 
 then can we use their names 
 no 
god damn it  when is somebody
gonna go on the record in this story 
you guys are about to write a story
that says the former attorney general   
the highest ranking law enforcement
officer in this country is a crook 
just be sure you re right 
operator  essex house  may i help you 
carl  john mitchell 
mitchell  yes 
sir  this is carl bernstein
of the washington post   
and i m sorry to disturb you at this hour 
tomorrow we re running a story
in the paper   
and we just think that you should
have a chance to comment on it 
what does it say 
 john m  mitchell  while serving   
 as united states attorney general   
 personally controlled a secret cash fund   
 that was used to gather information
about the democrats   
  according to   
 jesus 
    sources involved
in the watergate investigation  
 jesus 
  beginning in the spring of 1971    
 almost a year before he left
the justice department   
 to become president nixon s
campaign manager   
 on march 1  mitchell personally
approved withdrawals from the fund  
all that crap 
you re putting it in the paper 
 well  
 it s all been denied 
you tell your publisher 
tell katie graham   
she s going to get her tit caught in
the big ringer if that s published 
christ  that s the most
sickening thing i ever heard 
sir  i was just wondering
if i could ask you some questions 
 what time is it 
 it s 11 30  sir 
11 30  is it morning or night 
it s 1 1  30 at night  sir 
sir  the committee to re elect
has issued a statement to our story   
but there are just a couple of questions  
did the committee tell you
to go ahead and publish the story 
you fellows have got
a great ballgame going 
as soon as you re done 
we re going to do a story on all of you 
sir  there s just a couple of questions  
call my law office in the morning 
there s no question
you properly identified yourself 
he said it right off the top 
mitchell know
he was talking to a reporter 
yeah  but i think i woke him up 
 get good notes 
 verbatim 
he really said that about mrs  graham 
well  i d cut the words  her tit 
and print it 
why 
this is a family newspaper 
you know  once when i was reporting   
lyndon johnson s top guy
gave me the word 
they were looking for a successor
for j  edgar hoover 
i wrote it and the day it appeared 
johnson held a press conference   
and appointed hoover
head of the fbi for life 
when he was done 
he turned to his top guy   
and the president said 
 call ben bradlee and tell him   fuck you   
then everybody said 
 you did it  ben  you screwed up 
 you stuck us with hoover forever  
i screwed up  but i wasn t wrong 
how much can you tell me
about deep throat 
how much do you need to know 
do you trust him 
yeah 
i can t do the reporting for my reporters
which means i have to trust them 
and i hate trusting anybody 
run that  baby 
tv announcer  the washington post
reported that   
while still in office as attorney general   
john mitchell had personally
controlled a secret republican fund 
mitchell denied any such involvement
and called the story ludicrous 
the new charge also brought a response
from vice president agnew   
at his stop in tampa 
i have full confidence in mr  mitchell   
and in the people
in the republican organization 
and i think that that kind
of unattributed report   
at a time like this is counterproductive 
we must bear in mind
that those who published it   
have already shown
their sympathy for the other ticket 
tv announcer  a band
and some young cheerleaders    
all non denial denials 
they doubt our ancestry 
but they don t say the story isn t accurate 
i mean  did you understand
one thing he was saying 
what i can t figure out is 
what is a real denial 
well  if they start calling us goddamn liars 
we better start circling the wagons 
when do you think they ll start doing that 
when they get out of tampa 
carl  joe  come on 
what s going on with you guys at the fbi 
i ve been trying to get to you for weeks 
your secretary says you re not in 
last night i called 
you said you couldn t talk   
and this morning  as soon as
our mitchell story hits the stands   
you call me and say you ve got
to see me right away  why 
look  you guys have been causing
big trouble at the bureau 
why 
our reports are showing up
in your paper almost verbatim 
i mean  you ve really been on the mark 
except for mitchell 
now  we didn t have that   
 that he controlled the funds 
 right 
our agents have been busting ass   
but we re gonna go back now
and see if we ve missed anything 
what i don t understand is all the people   
who might know details
of the bugging operation   
the fbi hasn t even talked to 
and why have you conducted your
interviews of creep personnel   
at creep headquarters   
instead of at their homes
where they might feel freer to talk 
joe  wait a minute 
why have the interviews at creep
always been conducted   
within the presence of the lawyer
who works for creep 
look  you know i can t answer
for the whole bureau 
 oh  come on  i m just  
 i do what i m told 
i followed my orders  period 
what orders 
carl  wait  woodward 
wait 
bob 
out of the blue  out of the blue 
okay  this morning i get a tip
to call a guy by the name of alex shipley   
who is now the assistant
attorney general of tennessee 
now  the guy told me  that called me 
that said    
he said that shipley was asked
in the summer of 1971    
by an old army buddy  a donald segretti   
to join a group of other lawyers   
for nixon s campaign to sabotage
the democratic candidates 
listen  make a left when you can 
we ll go to my place 
sabotage democratic candidates 
that s right  now  i was able to make
a couple of calls today   
and i got segretti s records for the year    
his travel records for the years 1971  72 
does the fbi know about    
 did you say left or right 
 left 
we re going to my place 
we gotta go over the records 
 does the fbi know about segretti 
 the fbi interrogated segretti   
and found out he wasn t involved
in the break in so they dropped it 
they didn t follow through on it 
 where is he 
 he s in california 
bob  jesus  look at this 
carl  what 
bob  segretti crisscrossed the country
at least a dozen times 
he only stayed in cities
where there were democratic primaries 
carl  if the break in is just one incident
in a campaign of sabotage   
that began a whole year
before watergate    
bob  then for the first time 
the break in makes sense 
carl  this isn t so crazy 
this thing didn t start
with the bugging at the headquarters 
segretti was doing this
a year before the bugging 
and a year before 
nixon wasn t slaughtering muskie 
he was running behind muskie 
before muskie self destructed 
if he self destructed 
 hi  donald segretti 
 that s right 
i m carl bernstein
from the washington post 
hi 
what can i do for you 
well  my paper just sent me out here
to try to persuade you to go on the record 
why me 
i guess because you were
the head coordinator   
of nixon s sabotage campaign
against the democrats 
 carl  you want some coffee 
 you read my mind 
carl  tell me something 
what do you imagine
the head coordinator does 
well  i guess basically you re involved
in recruiting other people like yourself   
other lawyers 
 lawyers 
 like alex shipley 
i made it clear that i would not do
anything violent or illegal 
what do you mean by illegal 
watergate  i mean  that s    
the whole bugging  that s horrendous 
and what kind of stuff
do you guys do then 
nickel and dime stuff 
stuff  stuff with a little wit attached to it 
you mean  when you sent out
on muskie s stationery that   
senator hubert humphrey
was going out with call girls 
listen  if anything 
it helped the man s image 
what was the one
on muskie s stationery that you sent out   
that said that scoop jackson
was having a bastard child 
so  sometimes it got up to a quarter 
off the record 
i think one of the most interesting ones
was the canuck letter 
what about it 
come on  where you claimed
that muskie slurred the canadians 
no  i didn t write that 
do you know who did 
carl  when you guys print it in the papers 
then i ll know 
smart guy  donald 
you re no dummy 
i m a lawyer  carl 
i m a lawyer  i m a good lawyer   
and i ll probably wind up
going to jail and being disbarred   
and i don t know what i did
that was so goddamn awful 
i ll tell you something 
none of this was my idea 
i didn t go looking for the job 
well  that s important 
chapin came to you 
you know what 
it s funny  but i keep forgetting that
you guys knew each other in college 
you were friends at sc  you and chapin 
who else was there 
there was me   
dwight   
ziegler   
all the usc mafia 
and that s when you got involved
in meaningless student elections   
when you start to try to get your man in
so you stuffed ballot boxes and    
what s that term you guys use
for screwing up the opposition 
 rat fucking 
 that s right 
you were just doing
the same kind of stuff   
when you were out campaigning
for president nixon 
let me tell you something 
we did a lot of worse things in college 
look  let me ask you something  carl 
what would you have done
if you were just getting out of the army   
been away from the real world
for four years   
didn t know what kind of law
you wanted to practice   
and one day you get a call
from an old friend   
asking if you want to go to work
for the president of the united states 
chapin was the appointment
secretary for nixon when he called 
yeah  listen 
if those sinister things really happened   
i don t think dwight
knew anything about them 
he just did what he was told 
told by who 
what s the topic for tonight 
rat fucking 
in my day it was simply known
as the double cross 
in our present context   
it means infiltration of the democrats 
segretti won t go on the record   
but if he would 
we know he would implicate chapin 
and that would put you
inside the white house 
who 
be specific 
how high up 
you ll have to find that out for yourself 
i don t like newspapers 
i don t care for inexactitude   
and shallowness 
the creep slush fund
that financed the rat fucking   
we ve just about got that nailed down 
i don t know how  
did you change cabs 
yeah 
does the fbi know what we know 
does justice 
why haven t they done anything 
if it didn t deal directly with the break in 
they didn t pursue 
who told them not to 
don t you understand what you re on to 
 mitchell knew 
 of course mitchell knew 
do you think something this size
just happens 
haldeman had to know  too 
you ll get nothing from me
about haldeman 
segretti said that  
don t concentrate on segretti 
you ll miss the overall 
the letter that destroyed
the muskie candidacy   
the canuck letter 
did that come from inside the white  
you re missing the overall 
but what overall 
they were frightened of muskie 
and look who got destroyed 
they wanted to run against mcgovern 
look who they re running against 
they bugged  they followed people   
false press leaks  fake letters 
they canceled
democratic campaign rallies 
they investigated
democratic private lives 
they planted spies  stole documents 
and on and on 
now  don t tell me you think this is
all the work of little don segretti 
the fbi and justice know this 
 car engine starting 
 carl 
 yeah 
why don t you pick up
your messages more often 
 right  you got a cigarette 
 yeah 
who s pete teller

i have this whole place to take care of 
 carl

 i don t have time for this  i m a busy man

alleged conversation with sally aiken

i have a wife  and a family 
and a dog  and a cat 
 a wife  and a family 
and a dog  and a cat  
right  ken  right  yeah 
now  ken  i don t want to print
that you were in sally s apartment 
thank god 
i just want to know what you said
in sally s apartment 
 telephone ringing 
carl  hello 
bob  bernstein   
i just got a tip from our fbi source 
the secret cash fund financed segretti 
 jesus 
 all right  now  listen 
chapin hired segretti  we know that 
and we know haldeman hired chapin 
haldeman has to be the fifth name
to control the fund 
sloan knows 
we ve only got four out of the five
who controlled the fund 
it has to be haldeman 
i don t think we ve got it 
we know the fifth
is a top white house official 
but no one has said it 
no one has named haldeman 
 no one s denied it 
 that still doesn t prove it was haldeman 
if you go to bed at night
and there s no snow on the ground   
when you wake up
and there s snow on the ground   
you can say it snowed during the night 
although you didn t see it 
but if we can t prove the fifth man
is haldeman  we re wiped out 
everything in that campaign
is done with his approval 
we know that everybody
who works under haldeman   
does so with his knowledge 
and everybody is under haldeman 
except the president 
common sense says it s haldeman 
if we go and see sloan   
and we tell him that we know that
he named haldeman to the grand jury    
then all we would need to do
is have him confirm it 
right 
 want to do it that way 
 yes 
let s go back and see sloan 
we can t go now  cause he s not home yet 
he may not be answering 
but he might be there 
 rapping at door 
 hi 
 please 
listen  we ve already written the story 
we just need you to define  
deborah s in the hospital
and my in laws are coming  
 two questions 
 we understand 
two questions 
the cash that financed
the watergate break in   
five men had control of the fund 
mitchell  stans  magruder  kalmbach 
we have confirmations on those four 
 we just found out haldeman s the fifth 
 i m not your source on that 
we re not asking you to be our source 
all we re asking is to confirm it 
i m not your source on haldeman 
okay  look  when you were questioned
by the grand jury  
you had to name names 
 of course  everything they asked  yes 
 if they asked you  all right if they    
i don t know     say we wrote a story
that said that haldeman   
was the fifth name to control the fund 
 would we be in any trouble 
 would we be wrong 
let me put it this way 
i would have no problems
if you wrote a story like that 
 you wouldn t 
 no 
 that s okay  yeah 
 okay 
 oh  you had a baby 
 yes  my wife did 
 little boy or girl 
 that s terrific 
it s a girl 
 congratulations 
 thank you 
 we re sorry to bother you 
 yeah 
 will you give our best to her 
 i will 
well  i think that  woodward 
and i am curious of the fact   
that the fbi  in its entire inquiry 
never talked to the    
or did any inquiries into the second
most powerful man to the president 
joe  you don t seem to understand 
no  you get nothing about haldeman
out of me 
but we don t need to know anything  joe 
tomorrow we re going
with a story on the fbi 
now  what does that mean 
and we re going to establish
in that story   
that you guys just about blew
the whole investigation 
oh  no  we didn t miss so much 
you didn t know haldeman
had control of the slush fund 
oh  yes  we did  it s all in our files 
 not about haldeman 
 yeah  haldeman  john haldeman 
look  now  look  i m very busy 
i ve got to go put the kids to bed 
that s the confirmation right there 
wait a minute  wait a sec 
did he say john 
 he said haldeman 
 he said john haldeman 
what the hell difference does it make
if he said isaiah or david 
there s only one haldeman 
yeah  well  isaiah or david
aren t assistants to the president 
i don t know  it still feels thin 
christ  i just wish we knew
if we could print this 
now wait a minute 
we didn t make them do these things   
but once they did  they re fair game 
harry  let s go over your sources again 
i want to hear it 
sloan told the grand jury 
he answered everything they asked him 
that means
there s gotta be a record somewhere 
he told the grand jury  the fbi confirms 
what more do you need 
i happen to love this country 
you know  we re not a bunch of zanies
out to bring it down 
harry  weren t you arguing
the opposite way 
no  not at all 
all right  now hold it 
one thing has nothing to do
with the other 
we re about to accuse haldeman
who only happens to be   
the second most important man
in this country   
of conducting a criminal conspiracy
from inside the white house 
it would be nice if we were right 
 have you double checked your sources 
 jesus 
 bernstein  are you sure on this story 
 absolutely 
 woodward 
 i m sure 
i m not  it still seems thin 
get another source 
how many fucking sources
do they think we ve got 
 are you sure deep throat won t confirm 
 he won t confirm  i told you that 
what about the guy in justice 
you can t call him 
he s right next to the grand jury 
 we have no choice  it s trouble 
 it s 20 minutes to deadline 
i don t even know
if i can get him on the phone 
operator  dr  kissinger s office 
bob  deputy general s office  please 
do you know when you expect him back 
no  sir  i believe he s left for the evening 
if you d like to leave a message    
oh  could you hold  please 
hi  this is carl 
i m sorry to disturb you now   
but we re going with the story
that haldeman was the fifth man   
in control of the fund
and they re hassling us here 
we ve got three confirmations 
if you could help us  i d appreciate it 
lawyer  i won t say anything
about haldeman  not ever 
i understand 
we wouldn t want you to do that 
we know it s against the law
for you to say anything 
if there s a way you could warn us
to hold on the story  we d appreciate it 
i d really like to help you  but i can t 
look  i m going to count to 10  all right 
if there s any reason
we should hold on the story   
hang up the phone before i get to 10 
if the story s all right  you just be on
the phone after i get to 10  all right 
 hang up  right 
 that s right 
 you got it 
 yeah 
we re straight  all right 
i m going to start counting  okay

one  two   
three  four  five   
six  seven

 what happened 
i said if i get up to 10
and you don t hang up  it s solid 
 did he confirm it 
 absolutely 
we ve got to tell bradlee 
bernstein got another source 
the guy at justice confirmed 
if there s any doubt 
we can run it tomorrow 
you don t have to  the story s solid 
we re sure of it 
i just got off the phone with him  it s gold 
okay  we go with it 
woodstein 
 you know what it s about 
 no 
tv announcer  sloan  who resigned
as campaign treasurer   
after the watergate break in   
showed up for a deposition
in the common cause suit on   
disclosure of campaign contributions 
and denied naming haldeman 
mr  sloan  would you care to comment
on testimony before the grand jury 
i d like my attorney
to answer that question 
gentlemen  the answer is
an unequivocal  no  
mr  sloan did not implicate mr  haldeman
in that testimony at all 
it is in his testimony
that mr  sloan acknowledged   
 that it was an espionage fund 
 no  not at all 
did he mention any use of funds
for espionage activity 
none  whatsoever  thank you  gentlemen 
thank you 
tv announcer  he expanded his denial
to include his statements to the fbi   
and to all federal authorities 
a short time later at the white house   
news secretary ronald ziegler
delivered a strong attack   
on the washington post 
ziegler  why is the post trying to do it 
you have a man   
who is the editor of the washington post
by the name of ben bradlee 
i think anyone
who would want to honestly assess   
what his political persuasions are  would   
i think come to the conclusion 
quite quickly   
that he is not a supporter
of president nixon 
i respect the free press 
i don t respect the type of journalism   
the shabby journalism that is
being practiced by the washington post 
all i know is that the story
that ran this morning   
is incorrect and it s been so   
stated as being incorrect   
by not only me  but by the individual   
whose grand jury 
secret grand jury testimony   
they based their story on 
and that individual has denied
that he ever so testified 
tv announcer  no sooner had
ziegler finished   
than the president s campaign manager   
clark macgregor  met with reporters 
macgregor  using innuendo   
third person hearsay   
unsubstantiated charges 
anonymous sources   
and huge  scare headlines   
the post has maliciously
sought to give the appearance   
of a direct connection between
the white house and the watergate 
a charge which the post knows   
and half a dozen investigations
have found to be false 
the hallmark of the post campaign
is hypocrisy   
and its celebrated double standard
is today visible for all to see 
i m not talking to you about
haldeman or anybody else 
 then what went wrong 
 nothing 
just tell us what went wrong 
didn t you say that the fbi had
the information on haldeman in the files 
 no 
 because we have it in the notes   
from the conversation
we had on the telephone right here 
we have to go talk to your boss
if you don t talk to us 
what the hell are you talking about 
i ll deny everything 
we re not trying
to get anybody into trouble 
we re just trying to find out
if we made some errors 
if we made a mistake 
then we ll come off the story 
just tell us if we re wrong 
tell us if we screwed up 
i m not talking about it 
i am not talking to you
about haldeman or anybody else 
in fact  i can t even be seen talking
to either one of you bastards 
 what are you afraid of  who got to you 
 are we being set up 
 are we  joe  tell us 
 are we being set up 
 just tell us  we won t print it 
 fuck you 
and fuck you 
honest to god  i just don t know 
 oh  i see 
 it s in the notes 
yeah  we had another call on a long list
and i ve got another call  i ve gotta go 
 did you mean bob haldeman 
 yeah  bob haldeman 
jesus  what was our mistake 
maybe there was no mistake 
then they re just setting us up 
then the whole thing was a set up 
and they just hung us 
more denunciations 
you ll have to make a statement  ben 
one senator just gave a speech
slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes 
i knew we had enemies 
but i didn t know we were this popular 
wow  look at this 
my non denial denial 
fuck it  let s stand by the boys 
okay  foreign 
all right  here s our headline 
radio hanoi reports the
united states north vietnam agreement   
for a settlement of the vietnam war 
 telephone ringing 
carl  woodward  what did you find out 
what d he say 
what time is it 
 you fell asleep 
 god damn it 
deep throat  over here 
you let haldeman slip away 
yes 
you ve done worse
than let haldeman slip away 
you ve got people feeling sorry for him 
i didn t think that was possible 
in a conspiracy like this   
you build from the outer edges
and you go step by step 
if you shoot too high and miss 
everybody feels more secure 
 you put the investigation back months 
 yes  we know that 
and if we re wrong  we re resigning 
were we wrong 
you ll have to find that out  won t you 
listen  i m tired
of your chicken shit games 
i don t want hints 
i need to know what you know 
it was a haldeman operation 
the whole business was run by haldeman 
the money  everything 
it won t be easy getting at him  he was
insulated  you ll have to find out how 
mitchell started doing covert stuff
before anyone else 
the list is longer than anyone can imagine 
it involves the entire
u s  intelligence community   
fbi   
cia  justice  it s incredible 
the cover up
had little to do with watergate 
it was mainly to protect
the covert operations 
it leads everywhere 
get out your notebook  there s more 
your lives are in danger 
hi  i finally got sloan on the phone 
 classical music blaring 
why the hell didn t you tell me
over the phone 
 woodward says phones aren t safe 
 can t trust them 
 come on in 
 we can t come in  sir 
woodward says
there s electronic surveillance 
 surveillance  who s doing it 
 it s being done 
people s lives are in danger 
maybe even ours 
what happened to that
justice source of yours 
i guess i made the instructions
too complicated 
because he thought i said  hang up 
when i just said  hang on  
 oh  jesus 
 the story is right 
haldeman was the fifth name
to control that fund   
 and sloan would ve told the grand jury 
 sloan wanted to tell the jury 
 why didn t he 
 because nobody asked 
nobody asked him 
the cover up had little to do
with the break in 
it was to protect covert operations
and the covert activities   
involving the entire
u s  intelligence community 
did deep throat say
that people s lives are in danger 
yes 
 what else did he say 
 he said everyone is involved 
you know the results
of the latest gallup poll 
half the country never even
heard of the word  watergate  
nobody gives a shit 
you guys are probably pretty tired  right 
you should be  go on home 
get a nice hot bath  rest up 15 minutes   
then get your asses back in gear 
we re under a lot of pressure 
you know  and you put us there 
nothing s riding on this except the
first amendment of the constitution   
freedom of the press 
and maybe the future of the country 
not that any of that matters   
but if you guys fuck up again 
i m going to get mad 
goodnight
