take this
marilia are you there
yes
send up more cloth
and doublesided tape
i cant get it until tomorrow
ok
i also wanted a needle
thread and scissors
youre joking right
yeah
our face identifies us
for burn victims
saving their lives is not enough
they need to have a face
even if its from a corpse
a face with features
so they can gesticulate
i have participated in
three out of the nine
face transplants
carried out in the world
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life
good
for a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression
we have to mould the muscles
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings
maternity hospital
vera ive brought you some opium
operating theater
can you breathe more gently
if you want me
to stop breathing kill me
dont talk rubbish
how long will all this last
your skin is softer than i thought
if you dont end it i will
if youd wanted to kill yourself
youd have tried to cut your jugular
in any case
i didnt know your skin was so soft
here it is
taken from the animal
while it was still alive
thank you
now there wont be any more burns
you said that a year ago
i was hasty
tell me if it burns you
no
and now
no
now
i have given the name gal
to the artificial skin
ive been working on
in recent years
tell me if the mosquito bites you
this skin is resistant
to every insect bite
no
which means a natural barrier to
malaria for example
naturally ive carried out
a rigorous quality control
on the tissues implanted in mammals
specifically in athymic mice
and the results
have been spectacular
this leads me to suppose
they would be equally positive
in human mammals
what does the name gal mean
are they initials
that was my wifes name
she was burned to death in a car crash
in you presentation you stated
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria
what makes you think that
the artificial skin is much harder
than human skin
and it smells different
its been proven that the malaria mosquito
distinguishes human skin by the smell
gal smells different and repels it
lets see if we can get rid of him
that isnt enough
how did you toughen the skin
excuse me
lets go somewhere quieter
theres only one way to toughen skin
by mutating it
yes thats what i did
transgenesis
yes
i transferred genetic information
from a pigs cell to a human cell
a pigs cell
its much stronger than ours
youre insane
you know the application
of transgenetic therapy
in humans is completely forbidden
yes i do
and forgive me
but it seems the ultimate paradox
we intervene in everything around us
meat clothes
vegetables fruit everything
why not use scientific advances
to improve our species
you know how many diseases
we could cure with transgenesis
or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided
dont go on
i know the list by heart
and i think of it every day
but even so
i must forbid you from
investigating further
or ill be forced to report you
to the scientific community
over and above what you or i may think
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this
dont worry
gal was a personal adventure
i did it in memory of my wife
and solely to extend my knowledge
i remember
the first time
you told me about this experiment
it seemed like a dream then
and it still is
the president has ordered me
to give it up indefinitely
shit and itll be the business
of the century
it will be
but we wont benefit from it
if you give up research
will you go back to surgery
your patients will be delighted
i dont know
weve got a waiting list
for operations in el cigarral
im leaving
wait so am i
do you like what you see
what do you mean
is there anything you want to improve
no
i dont want to improve anything
can i take it im finished
yes
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world
and now what
now im going to light
this opium pipe
and smoke it
i mean us
me
what are you going to do with me
i dont know
ill think about it
when
if you keep on im leaving
couldnt we just live
live together
live together
how
like everyone
you and i arent like everyone
look on it as another
of your experiments
living together as equals
thats it
here
i could set fire
to the house with this
im yours
im made to measure for you
and youve just told me
that you like me
did i say that
i know you look at me
since you brought me here
we practically live in the same room
in this pocket
carnival celebrations
are being held on the gran via
you shouldnt have used her face
if id been here
id have warned you of the danger
theres a resemblance
but she isnt the same
the resemblance is too strong
have you thought
what to do with her
no
youll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever
why all the hurry to get rid of her
if you dont kill her
shell kill herself
stories repeat themselves
no not this one
vera is stronger a born survivor
youre sick
if you dont get rid of her
what you feel now will end up
devouring you like a cancer
when you realize itll be too late
how are you so sure of what i feel
if even i dont know
because i know you as if id borne you
fire the servants
and dont hire anyone
what do you want
to see my mother
i havent seen her for ten years

of the twentyfour security cameras
which protect the jewellery store
apart from the thief
who appears in the image

youre hurting me
its very big
its like it always was
it used to drive you crazy
yes
and it still does
it drives me crazy
shut up youre weird
youre distracting me
kill her
kill them both
as children
they played at killing each other
i knew that one day
theyd do it for real
the tiger and robert
yes
theyre brothers
but they dont know it
at least ive never told them
i had zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after
and robert is the son of mr ledgard
their fathers were very different
but both were born insane
its my fault
ive got insanity in my entrails
id served at the ledgards house
since i was a child
mrs ledgard was sterile
and when my robert was born
they kept him
and said shed given birth to him
but i was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born
zeca spoke to me as if he knew me
he mistook you for gal
roberts wife
unlike robert
zeca grew up far from me
when he was seven
he started transporting drugs
i never saw him
he grew up on the street
about twelve years ago
zeca came back to the house
he was on the run
and asked us for shelter
i hid him in an outhouse
but gal found him
she took a fancy to him
and they ended up
running away together
their car crashed
zeca survived and ran away
but she
robert found her horribly burned
but still with a flicker of life
he snatched her back from death
at the last minute
he worked day and night
he did endless research
he didnt sleep
he only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying
covered with gauzes
he was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh
after the accident
we lived like vampires
in total darkness and with no mirrors
to everyones surprise
after several endless months
gal started to improve
the things that a madmans love can do
one day
when she could finally stand unaided
gal heard normas voice in the distance
singing a song that she had taught her
and she got emotional
for the first time in many months
she got emotional
and it was
like feeling she was alive again
when she opened the window
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass
she didnt look human
she was a cinder
she gave a scream
that echoed through the house
and threw herself out the window
years later little norma
went in search of her mother
along the same road
her mother had taken
through the window
what did you do with the body
i buried it well
did you pray
yes
everything you told me
shall we go inside
do you mind if we
leave it
for tomorrow
the tiger really messed me up
as you wish
but hold me

my son is alive
if he is hes far away
all his friends that were questioned
even your assistant
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave

neuropsychiatric institute

norma
sweetheart
i wont touch you
where are you going
where are you going
norma love
everything ok
yes
its me norma
you can come out
the men have gone
cant you put her in a dress
in that gown she looks worse than she is
we tried
but she cant stand
any kind of fitted clothing
she rips it off
dr ledgard i dont think
you should visit her so often
shes my daughter
but she doesnt recognize you
and she gets worse when she sees you
in her mind
shes convinced you attacked her
i just found her lying there
why cant you get that into her head
she identifies you with the rapist
maybe
we let her out too soon
it was your idea
that she should socialize
she was getting over her social phobia
how could i know
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you
over here
please get me out of here
help
get me out of here
im thirsty and im starving
youll eat and drink now
i havent done anything
this is a mistake
possibly
everyone makes mistakes
come over here you bastard
and set me free
turn around
im chaining you nearer to the table
but why
i havent done anything
youll be more comfortable there
eat
thank you
sorry if i annoyed you the other day
ive been alone for so long
wait please dont go
please dont go
we have to talk
my condolences
we did what we could
it wasnt enough
and you did it very badly
im going to report the hospital
and you in particular
for homicidal negligence
please this isnt the place
please
you really want to work today
yes
you should rest and try to forget
i couldnt sleep and working
will keep my mind occupied
call the whole team
ok
my mother will be very worried
i never stay away without calling her
you have a daughter havent you
why do you say that
the toys
my daughter is dead
we buried her today
im sorry
and now some aftershave
why did you shave me
thats a good question
yes
its us
ill let you in
if he says were late
say there were two
accidents on the road
you know how he is about punctuality
good evening
youre late
there were two accidents on the road
heres the paperwork and envelopes
when youre ready well start
two accidents one near that town
hes very young
he looks like a boy
he isnt
hes 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants
its a particularly confidential case
whats happened
what did you do to me
a vaginoplasty
no
listen carefully to what im going to say
its very important
as youve just seen
the operation was successful
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together
but dont worry
its easy to prevent that
you
you have to keep the new orifice open
and manage bit by bit to make it deeper
think that your life
depends on that orifice
that you breathe through it
in this case
there are several dilators
of different sizes
start by inserting the smallest one
it will hurt at first
but in a few months
the largest one will fit without any effort
and the skin
will be perfectly healed
this is very good
how long have you been using
the last dilator
four weeks
can i go now
go where
home
but weve just started
what else are you going to do
youll see when the time comes
why are you doing this
do you remember
casilda efraizs wedding
in that spectacular house
im normas father
she was the child you raped
i dont think i actually raped her
you dont think
have you lost your memory
id taken a lot of pills
and i can hardly remember it
well i didnt take anything
and ill never forget it
what are you going to do now
its a pity you cant see your whole body
they dont seem pneumatic now do they
theyre like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface
the marks on your skin will disappear
theres still work to do
but to put you mind at ease
therell be no more burns
ive bought you this body stocking
itll protect your skin
itll also give you support
and mould you
get used to wearing it all the time
like a second skin
put it on
will you zip me up please
bitch
stop
give me the key
or ill come up and stab you
stay where you are
ill slit my throat
and then youll have no toy
you wouldnt dare
we were lucky
several weeks later
i cant keep calling you vicente
from today your name is vera
i dont know if youre there
im returning the makeup book
and the makeup
do what you want with them
and you can practice it anywhere
on a hospital bed in jail
theres a place where you can take refuge
a place inside you
a place to which
no one else has access
a place that no one can destroy
to access that place there is yoga
an ancient technique
its a place where youll find peace
where youll find tranquillity
freedom
but you must practice it
continuously intensely
and then youll achieve it
yoga books
my cigarral
i missed it so much
these four years seemed eternal
was it that long
four years and two months
i thought youd forgotten me
i thought that
at least youd have called me
when norma died
my poor child
to throw herself out the window
id rather not talk about it
as you wish
but im going to miss her so much
lets go to the kitchen
im parched
dont look at the surfaces
everything has to be cleaned
call the agency
and hire the help you need
youve installed more televisions
theyre not televisions
its to control a patient
ill explain
from now on youll look after her
but you dont have to go into her room
she cleans it
are there more patients
no shes the only one
youve put on your uniform
you dont have to wear it
i like the uniform
because it means were together again
who is she
i told you
her names vera
whats she doing
shes writing on the wall
i can see that
it smells of croquettes
she called me on the intercom
and asked who i was and what day it was
when i told her
she started writing on the wall
i dont want her
to take liberties with you
dont unlock her room
if theres a problem call me
she reminds me of someone
all the women ive operated on
end up reminding you of someone
yes but her more so
the face is the same
i breathe
i know i breathe
opium helps me forget
back to the present
what are you doing
slicing a pineapple
dont look at me like that
i wont hurt you
i dont trust you
if you did it would be much easier
for the three of us
pass me the tray
no ill take it up
just put it in the dumbwaiter
thank you
good morning
breakfast
thank you
wheres marilia
in the kitchen grumbling
she doesnt like anyone else
looking after you
last night
before we went to bed
we talked a lot and we made a promise
or did i dream it
you didnt dream it
you promised me that
thered be no more locked doors
that i could see all the tv channels
that i was free
and i promised you
that id never leave you
dont let me down
its all i have robert
your promise and mine
have you really thought
about what were going to do
when were in the streets
she could push me and run off
she promised not to
and you believe her
youre like a child
you were always like that with women
and look where it got you
thats enough
im sorry i took so long
ive put on high heels to practice
buy whatever you like
marilia has the cards
thank you
come along child
have you a problem with me
no but as you can see im very busy
i want to talk about the clinic
i told you on the phone
after talking to the president
i decided to stop using the house as a clinic
but if things are done carefully
theres no reason to worry
its not just that
ive got other plans
that dont include operating
if you dont want to operate
well rent the clinic from you
im speaking for all the team
our main patients love the isolation here
i said no fulgencio
and now id like to be alone
forgive me for not seeing you out
you know the way
are you still here
im leaving now
but first id like you
to see todays paper
vicente guillen pineiro
we gave him a sex change
he disappeared from his home
on september 10 2006
as you can see
and
i was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt
without hormones
he only wanted a cunt
hes much more muscular now
and hes working in l a
in porn movies and making a fortune
whats this about
it says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him
dont go there
those documents you
gave us were all false
it wouldnt be the first time
we accepted false documents
why do you think
our clients prefer this place
you know what i think
no and i dont care
i think you kidnapped him
and youve been experimenting
on him in every sense
you told us
youd tested your new skin
on athymic mice
knowing you as i do
i think youd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being
on vicente for example
do you know what would happen to you
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis
on someone youd kidnapped
i dont like threats
they end up infecting me
you dont know what youre talking about
get the hell out of here
if youre talking about me
dr roberts didnt kidnap me
and
whats that transgenesis
a cream
if im here its because
i came of my own will
and my name isnt vicente
its vera
vera cruz
and i was always a woman
give me a cigarette
thank you
no i thank you
does it still hurt
yes
shall we do it from behind
wouldnt that hurt more
wait
what
just today i bought lubricating cream
go and get it
its in my purse
im sure i put it in my new purse
but i cant find it
you must have left it downstairs
ill go and get it
vera
hurry up
at last
i thought youd gone
