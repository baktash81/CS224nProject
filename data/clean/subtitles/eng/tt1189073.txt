take this 
marilia  are you there 
yes 
send up more cloth
and double sided tape 
i can t get it until tomorrow 
ok 
i also wanted a needle 
thread and scissors 
you re joking  right 
yeah 
our face identifies us 
for burn victims 
saving their lives is not enough 
they need to have a face
even if it s from a corpse 
a face with features   
so they can gesticulate 
i have participated in
three out of the nine
face transplants
carried out in the world   
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life 
good   
for a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression   
we have to mould the muscles   
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings 
maternity hospital
vera  i ve brought you some opium 
operating theater
can you breathe more gently 
if you want me
to stop breathing  kill me 
don t talk rubbish 
how long will all this last 
your skin is softer than i thought 
if you don t end it  i will 
if you d wanted to kill yourself   
you d have tried to cut your jugular 
in any case   
i didn t know your skin was so soft 
here it is   
taken from the animal
while it was still alive 
thank you 
now there won t be any more burns 
you said that a year ago 
i was hasty 
tell me if it burns you 
no 
and now 
no 
now 
i have given the name  gal    
to the artificial skin
i ve been working on   
in recent years 
tell me if the mosquito bites you 
this skin is resistant
to every insect bite   
no 
   which means a natural barrier to
   malaria  for example 
naturally  i ve carried out
a rigorous quality control   
on the tissues implanted in mammals   
specifically  in athymic mice   
and the results   
   have been spectacular 
this leads me to suppose
they would be equally positive   
in human mammals 
what does the name gal mean 
are they initials 
that was my wife s name 
she was burned to death in a car crash 
in you presentation you stated   
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria 
what makes you think that 
the artificial skin is much harder
than human skin   
and it smells different 
it s been proven that the malaria mosquito   
distinguishes human skin by the smell 
gal smells different and repels it 
let s see if we can get rid of him 
that isn t enough 
how did you toughen the skin 
excuse me 
let s go somewhere quieter 
there s only one way to toughen skin 
by mutating it 
yes  that s what i did 
transgenesis 
yes 
i transferred genetic information   
from a pig s cell to a human cell 
a pig s cell 
it s much stronger than ours 
you re insane 
you know the application
of transgenetic therapy   
in humans is completely forbidden 
yes  i do 
and  forgive me 
but it seems the ultimate paradox 
we intervene in everything around us   
meat  clothes 
vegetables  fruit  everything 
why not use scientific advances
to improve our species 
you know how many diseases   
we could cure with transgenesis 
or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided 
don t go on 
i know the list by heart   
and i think of it every day 
but even so   
i must forbid you from
investigating further   
or i ll be forced to report you   
to the scientific community 
over and above what you or i may think   
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this 
don t worry 
gal was a personal adventure 
i did it in memory of my wife   
and solely to extend my knowledge 
i remember   
the first time
you told me about this experiment 
it seemed like a dream then 
and it still is 
the president has ordered me
to give it up  indefinitely 
shit  and it ll be the business
of the century 
it will be 
but we won t benefit from it 
if you give up research 
will you go back to surgery 
your patients will be delighted 
i don t know 
we ve got a waiting list
for operations in  el cigarral  
  i m leaving 
  wait  so am i 
do you like what you see 
what do you mean 
is there anything you want to improve 
no 
i don t want to improve anything 
can i take it i m finished 
yes   
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world 
and now what 
now i m going to light
this opium pipe   
and smoke it 
i mean us 
me 
what are you going to do with me 
i don t know 
i ll think about it 
when 
if you keep on  i m leaving 
couldn t we just live 
live together 
live together 
  how 
  like everyone 
you and i aren t like everyone 
look on it as another
of your experiments 
living together as equals 
that s it 
here 
i could set fire
to the house with this 
i m yours 
i m made to measure for you 
and you ve just told me
that you like me 
did i say that 
i know you look at me 
since you brought me here 
we practically live in the same room 
in this pocket 
carnival celebrations
are being held on the gran via 
you shouldn t have used her face 
if i d been here 
i d have warned you of the danger 
there s a resemblance 
but she isn t the same 
the resemblance is too strong 
have you thought
what to do with her 
no 
you ll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever 
why all the hurry to get rid of her 
if you don t kill her 
she ll kill herself 
stories repeat themselves 
no  not this one 
vera is stronger  a born survivor 
you re sick 
if you don t get rid of her   
what you feel now will end up
devouring you  like a cancer 
when you realize  it ll be too late 
how are you so sure of what i feel
if even i don t know 
because i know you as if i d borne you 
fire the servants
and don t hire anyone 
what do you want 
to see my mother 
i haven t seen her for ten years 
if she was a servant   
they ve just left and won t be back 
i saw them 
but she wasn t one of them 
my mother is prettier 
go away or i ll call the police

the main new items today   
are the carnival celebrations   
and the daring robbery committed
in the bvlgari jewellery store   
in the heart of madrid 
it happened last night   
and today we have the first images
recorded by one   
of the twenty four security cameras
which protect the jewellery store 
apart from the thief 
who appears in the image   
police are looking
for one of the store s employees   
who has been missing
for the last twenty four hours 
as if they were going to find him 
the bastard just had to
turn off the cameras   
but he changed his mind
and left one working 
he ll be rotting in hell now 
and the police are looking for you 
sure  if it weren t carnival

we ve got loads of patients 
a lot of people come here 
i know how to hide 
anyway  i want robert
to operate on my face 
robert 
when he gets you on the table   
he ll give you a lethal injection

i m sick of screwing in the open air 
this tiger wants a bed 
don t you like it 
you re hurting me 
it s very big 
it s like it always was 
it used to drive you crazy 
yes   
and it still does 
it drives me crazy 
shut up  you re weird 
you re distracting me 
kill her 
kill them both 
as children 
they played at killing each other 
i knew that one day
they d do it for real 
the tiger and robert 
yes 
they re brothers   
but they don t know it 
at least i ve never told them 
i had zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after 
and robert is the son of mr  ledgard 
their fathers were very different
but both were born insane 
it s my fault 
i ve got insanity in my entrails 
i d served at the ledgards  house
since i was a child 
mrs  ledgard was sterile   
and when my robert was born 
they kept him   
and said she d given birth to him 
but i was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born 
zeca spoke to me as if he knew me 
he mistook you for gal 
robert s wife 
unlike robert 
zeca grew up far from me 
when he was seven 
he started transporting drugs 
i never saw him 
he grew up on the street 
about twelve years ago
zeca came back to the house 
he was on the run
and asked us for shelter 
i hid him in an outhouse 
but gal found him   
she took a fancy to him   
and they ended up
running away together 
their car crashed 
zeca survived and ran away 
but she   
robert found her  horribly burned 
but still with a flicker of life 
he snatched her back from death
at the last minute 
he worked day and night 
he did endless research 
he didn t sleep 
he only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying   
covered with gauzes 
he was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh 
after the accident 
we lived like vampires   
in total darkness and with no mirrors 
to everyone s surprise   
after several endless months 
gal started to improve 
the things that a madman s love can do 
one day   
when she could finally stand unaided   
gal heard norma s voice in the distance   
singing a song that she had taught her 
and she got emotional 
for the first time in many months 
she got emotional 
and it was   
like feeling she was alive again 
when she opened the window   
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass 
she didn t look human 
she was a cinder 
she gave a scream
that echoed through the house   
and threw herself out the window 
years later  little norma   
went in search of her mother   
along the same road
her mother had taken 
through the window 
  what did you do with the body 
  i buried it well 
did you pray 
yes 
everything you told me 
shall we go inside 
do you mind if we
leave it
for tomorrow 
the tiger really messed me up 
as you wish 
but hold me 
don t worry  i ll wait 
i don t want you to feel uncomfortable 
thank you 
i m falling asleep 
sleep  my love 
six years earlier
thank you 
i owe this wedding to you 
don t exaggerate 
nico adores you 
without your help  he d adore me less 
  congratulations 
  thank you 
your daughter is getting on well

we re very sorry  ma am 
my son is alive 
  as we said   
  yes  you found the bike   
but my son 
he could have been kidnapped 
until his body appears 
you must keep looking  please 
we ve talked about this already  ma am 
you have to keep looking 
my son is alive 
if he is  he s far away 
all his friends that were questioned 
even your assistant   
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave 
but he said he d be home for supper 
cristina heard him

you can come out 
the men have gone 
can t you put her in a dress 
in that gown she looks worse than she is 
we tried   
but she can t stand
any kind of fitted clothing 
she rips it off 
dr  ledgard  i don t think
you should visit her so often 
  she s my daughter 
  but she doesn t recognize you 
and she gets worse when she sees you 
in her mind 
she s convinced you attacked her 
i just found her lying there 
why can t you get that into her head 
she identifies you with the rapist 
maybe   
we let her out too soon 
it was your idea
that she should socialize 
she was getting over her social phobia 
how could i know   
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you 
over here 
please  get me out of here 
help 
get me out of here 
i m thirsty and i m starving 
you ll eat and drink now 
i haven t done anything 
this is a mistake 
possibly 
everyone makes mistakes 
come over here  you bastard 
and set me free 
turn around 
i m chaining you nearer to the table 
but  why 
i haven t done anything 
you ll be more comfortable there 
eat 
thank you 
sorry if i annoyed you the other day 
i ve been alone for so long 
wait  please  don t go 
please  don t go 
we have to talk 
my condolences 
we did what we could 
it wasn t enough
and you did it very badly 
i m going to report the hospital 
and you in particular   
for homicidal negligence 
  please  this isn t the place 
  please   
you really want to work today 
yes 
you should rest and try to forget 
i couldn t sleep  and working
will keep my mind occupied 
  call the whole team 
  ok 
my mother will be very worried 
i never stay away without calling her 
you have a daughter  haven t you 
why do you say that 
the toys   
my daughter is dead 
we buried her today 
i m sorry 
and now  some aftershave 
why did you shave me 
that s a good question 
yes 
it s us 
i ll let you in 
if he says we re late 
say there were two
accidents on the road
you know how he is about punctuality 
good evening 
you re late 
there were two accidents on the road 
here s the paperwork and envelopes 
when you re ready  we ll start 
two accidents  one near that town   
he s very young 
he looks like a boy 
he isn t 
he s 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants 
it s a particularly confidential case 
what s happened 
what did you do to me 
a vaginoplasty
no   
listen carefully to what i m going to say 
it s very important 
as you ve just seen 
the operation was successful   
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together 
but don t worry 
it s easy to prevent that 
you   
you have to keep the new orifice open   
and manage  bit by bit  to make it deeper 
think that your life
depends on that orifice   
that you breathe through it 
in this case   
there are several dilators
of different sizes 
start by inserting the smallest one 
it will hurt at first   
but in a few months   
the largest one will fit without any effort   
and the skin   
will be perfectly healed 
this is very good 
how long have you been using
the last dilator 
four weeks 
can i go now 
  go where 
  home 
but we ve just started 
what else are you going to do 
you ll see  when the time comes 
why are you doing this 
do you remember
casilda efraiz s wedding 
in that spectacular house 
i m norma s father 
she was the child you raped 
i don t think i actually raped her 
you  don t think  
have you lost your memory 
i d taken a lot of pills
and i can hardly remember it 
well i didn t take anything
and i ll never forget it 
what are you going to do now 
it s a pity you can t see your whole body 
they don t seem pneumatic now  do they 
they re like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface 
the marks on your skin will disappear 
there s still work to do 
but to put you mind at ease 
there ll be no more burns 
i ve bought you this body stocking 
it ll protect your skin 
it ll also give you support
and mould you 
get used to wearing it all the time   
like a second skin 
put it on 
will you zip me up  please 
bitch 
stop 
give me the key
or i ll come up and stab you 
stay where you are 
i ll slit my throat   
and then you ll have no toy 
you wouldn t dare 
we were lucky 
several weeks later
i can t keep calling you vicente 
from today  your name is vera 
i don t know if you re there 
i m returning the makeup book
and the makeup 
do what you want with them 
   and you can practice it anywhere   
on a hospital bed  in jail 
there s a place where you can take refuge   
a place inside you   
a place to which   
no one else has access   
a place that no one can destroy 
to access that place there is yoga   
an ancient technique 
it s a place where you ll find peace 
where you ll find tranquillity   
freedom 
but you must practice it   
continuously  intensely   
and then you ll achieve it 
yoga books
my cigarral 
i missed it so much 
these four years seemed eternal 
  was it that long 
  four years and two months 
i thought you d forgotten me 
i thought that   
at least you d have called me
when norma died 
my poor child 
to throw herself out the window 
i d rather not talk about it 
as you wish 
but i m going to miss her so much 
let s go to the kitchen 
i m parched 
don t look at the surfaces 
everything has to be cleaned 
call the agency
and hire the help you need 
you ve installed more televisions 
they re not televisions 
it s to control a patient 
i ll explain 
from now on  you ll look after her 
but you don t have to go into her room 
she cleans it 
  are there more patients
  no  she s the only one 
you ve put on your uniform 
you don t have to wear it 
i like the uniform   
because it means we re together again 
who is she 
i told you 
her name s vera 
what s she doing 
she s writing on the wall 
i can see that 
it smells of croquettes 
she called me on the intercom   
and asked who i was and what day it was 
when i told her
she started writing on the wall 
i don t want her
to take liberties with you 
don t unlock her room 
if there s a problem  call me 
she reminds me of someone 
all the women i ve operated on
end up reminding you of someone 
yes  but her more so 
the face is the same 
i breathe 
i know i breathe 
opium helps me forget 
back to the present
  what are you doing 
  slicing a pineapple 
don t look at me like that 
i won t hurt you 
i don t trust you 
if you did  it would be much easier
for the three of us 
pass me the tray 
no  i ll take it up 
just put it in the dumbwaiter 
thank you 
good morning 
breakfast 
thank you 
where s marilia 
in the kitchen  grumbling 
she doesn t like anyone else
looking after you 
last night   
before we went to bed   
we talked a lot and we made a promise 
  or did i dream it 
  you didn t dream it 
you promised me that
there d be no more locked doors   
that i could see all the tv channels   
that i was free 
and i promised you
that i d never leave you 
don t let me down 
it s all i have  robert 
your promise and mine 
have you really thought
about what we re going to do 
when we re in the streets
she could push me and run off 
she promised not to 
and you believe her 
you re like a child 
you were always like that with women 
and look where it got you 
that s enough 
i m sorry i took so long 
i ve put on high heels to practice 
buy whatever you like 
marilia has the cards 
thank you 
come along  child 
have you a problem with me 
no  but as you can see i m very busy 
i want to talk about the clinic 
i told you on the phone 
after talking to the president   
i decided to stop using the house as a clinic 
but if things are done carefully 
there s no reason to worry 
it s not just that 
i ve got other plans
that don t include operating 
if you don t want to operate 
we ll rent the clinic from you 
i m speaking for all the team 
our main patients love the isolation here 
i said no  fulgencio 
and now i d like to be alone 
forgive me for not seeing you out 
you know the way 
are you still here 
i m leaving now   
but first i d like you
to see today s paper 
vicente guillen pineiro 
we gave him a sex change 
he disappeared from his home
on september 10  2006   
as you can see 
and 
i was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt   
without hormones 
he only wanted a cunt 
he s much more muscular now
and he s working in l  a   
in porn movies  and making a fortune 
what s this about 
it says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him 
don t go there 
those documents you
gave us were all false 
it wouldn t be the first time   
we accepted false documents 
why do you think
our clients prefer this place 
  you know what i think 
  no  and i don t care 
i think you kidnapped him   
and you ve been experimenting
on him in every sense 
you told us   
you d tested your new skin
on athymic mice 
knowing you as i do   
i think you d have no scruples
about testing it on a human being 
on vicente  for example 
do you know what would happen to you   
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis   
on someone you d kidnapped 
i don t like threats 
they end up infecting me 
you don t know what you re talking about 
get the hell out of here 
if you re talking about me 
dr  roberts didn t kidnap me 
and   
what s that transgenesis 
a cream 
if i m here it s because
i came of my own will 
and my name isn t vicente 
it s vera 
vera cruz 
and i was always a woman 
give me a cigarette 
thank you 
no  i thank you 
does it still hurt 
yes 
shall we do it from behind 
wouldn t that hurt more 
  wait   
  what 
just today i bought lubricating cream 
  go and get it 
  it s in my purse 
i m sure i put it in my new purse   
but i can t find it 
you must have left it downstairs 
i ll go and get it 
vera
