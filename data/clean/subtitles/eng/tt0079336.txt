among the first in new york  i think 
why are we standing in the hallway 
  please come in and have a drink 
  i could use one  it s been one of those days 
shelly  have you ever had

i hate to say this 
but if we don t sit down right away 
that roast beef
is just going to be inedible 
  i m starving  so it s fine with me 
  i ll take drink orders and make them myself 
i m petrified 
my father was like a maniac
before you came 
 clears throat  sighs 
vince  how long did you
actually live in guatemala 
oh  he was gone for ages 
i was in the jungle  
the bush  we called it  
for approximately nine months 
nine months  my god 
that really must have been something 
sheldon  it was unbelievable 
i saw things   
they have tsetse flies down there
the size of eagles 
really 
in the evening  i would stand in front
of my hut and watch in horror
as these giant flies would pick children
off the ground and carry them away 
  my god 
  oh  the things he told us 
   clicks tongue 
  oh  it was an incredible sight 
peasants screaming  chasing these flies
down the road  waving brooms 
you can imagine the pathetic quality
of this waving these crudely fashioned
brooms at these enormous flies
as they carried their children
off to almost certain death 
oh  that is just
the most horrible thing 
you sure these are flies
you re talking about 
flies 
the natives had a name for  em 
  josé grecos de muertos 
   mrs  kornpett gasps 
flamenco dancers of death 
you took those slides of them
that never came out  remember 
that s a shame  i really would have liked
to have seen those slides 
  me too 
  yeah 
i left  em in a jacket
that got martinized 
it broke my heart because those slides
would ve won me a pulitzer prize 
the enormous flies
flapping slowly away into the sunset 
small  brown babies
clutched in their beaks 
wow 
beaks  flies with beaks 
a sight i ll never forget 
i was stunned  appalled 
what did you do 
what did i do 
as a consultant 
what did you do about the flies 
sadly  there s very little you can do
because of the tremendous
red tape in the bush 
there s red tape in the bush 
enormous red tape  sheldon 
these flies  for example  uh 
they re protected against pilferage
under the provisions
of the guacamole act of 1917 
i ve been getting the national geographic
for years  i never ran into any  
  dad  could i have some more wine 
  yeah 
i d like some too 
for the purposes of a toast 
mrs  ricardo 
oh  uh  good idea 
um   
i m not the most eloquent guy
in the world 
but i would like to say that
this has been a most lovely occasion 
and i couldn t agree more 
and on sunday 
there s gonna be another occasion 
even more lovely  more sacred 
and all i really want to say is that
i m just honored
and moved to be part of
the kornpett family 
and i hope we ll be together
in the good times to share  em with joy 
and if there are bad times 
god forbid  we ll work that out too 
but together 
   mrs  kornpett sighs 
  oh 
  that was very lovely  mr  ricardo 
  yeah  i feel the same way  dad 
 glasses clinking 
uh  i d like to say that
as difficult as it is for me
to give my little girl away 
i m very happy that it s to someone
as wonderful as tommy 
and my hope is that
the kornpetts and ricardos share
many happy and peaceful occasions
through many happy and peaceful years 
   sobbing loudly 
  oh  hear  hear 
 sobbing continues 
 sobbing  hooting 
excuse me 
where is the phone 
phone 
  uh  there s one in the kitchen 
  where is the furthest one 
i have to make a long distance call 
and sometimes with these overseas connections
i have to scream like a banshee 
well  there s one in the basement 
but it s a mess 
oh  that s okay 
  through there 
  oh  i ll show you 
please  don t bother  i ll find it 
  dad and his mysterious phone calls 
   all laughing 
what did you say 
i i just said dad
and his mysterious phone calls 
what the hell do you mean by that 
nothing  really 
you re just always makin  these weird calls
in back rooms and pay booths 
you little snot nose 
those phone calls put you through college 
  vince  
  i i m sure tommy d didn t mean  
i worked myself up to a position
where i can make these kind of
top level phone calls to top businessmen 
and my own son derogates 
dad  i wasn t derogating 
well  maybe you weren t 
i m terribly sorry  everybody 
it s been a long day 
oh  listen   
  through there 
  yeah  first door to the left 
  pull the string for the light 
  thanks a million 
um  he s  um  
he s been working very hard lately 
  oh  listen   
  i mean n normally  he s  uh  
usually he s so affectionate
and physical with tommy 
listen  i can understand
a certain amount of resentment 
after all  he s had to work really hard
in his life and i really haven t 
it s ricardo 
yes  very smoothly 
but listen  that kind of money
by tomorrow  that s impossible 
no  ralph  you don t understand 
this is a major international deal 
it s not like we re fencing
some shit in the street 
no  they re not all in there 
i kept one out just in case
you pulled something like this 
what s the point in threatening me 
you can t  
hello 
christ 
  dad  what are you talking about 
  what am i talkin  about 
the man is crazy 
that s what i m talkin  about 
he s crazy  look at yourself 
you re foaming at the mouth 
sweetheart   it s toothpaste 
sweetheart  i love you very much 
but i know about these things 
that man is crazy  i will not
have you marrying into that family 
you re being absolutely sicilian
about this 
i m marrying tommy  not vince 
mm mmm  tommy is the acorn 
what acorn 
the acorn  sweetheart  from the tree 
  it s a saying 
  oh 
it s a great saying  dad 
really captures a whole lot 
i don t need the sarcasm  it s off 
  it is not off 
  it s off 
i m calling the caterers 
i m calling the guests 
it may be a little bit humiliating
and a little bit expensive 
but you are not
marrying into that family 
damn it  we are not calling it off 
tommy and i are gonna go to vegas
or some sleazy thing like that  i don t care 
but we are getting married 
  god  mom  will you please tell him 
  i think you re being a little irrational 
i m being irrational 
i sit there listening to stories
about the guacamole act of 1917
and tsetse flies
carrying off small children 
and i m being irrational 
well  so he embellishes a little bit 
first he s laughing  then he s crying 
then he practically belts tommy in the mouth 
he didn t practically
belt him in the mouth 
he almost belted tommy
in the mouth 
then he s gotta go down in the basement
to make phone calls  what is that 
  and what else 
  i don t like  uh  
i don t like his whole manner 
and for that
you wanna call off the wedding 
shelly 
you re just projecting like crazy 
  psychology on parade 
  go on  shelly  let her talk 
it isn t easy for fathers
to give away daughters 
it s a complicated relationship 
there s sexual stuff going on  
hey  hey 
i m not talking about incest 
for christ s sake 
but there is a certain sexual component
to father daughter relationships 
so the closer the wedding gets  i think 
the more edgy you re gonna be
and the more you re gonna fix on things
like mr  ricardo being a little flaky 
which i m not denying 
as a reason to reject
the whole idea of marriage 
i think she s right 
 6 000 a year tuition to listen to this 
  it doesn t make sense 
  no  it makes sense  it makes sense 
i m sorry 
there s no reason to be sorry 
all i want you to do is be more open
to tommy s father 
don t just reject him 
all right  i ll  
i ll try to be more open 
shelly  think how nervous he was
to meet you 
tommy s told him
so much about you 
  well  he must have been nervous 
  sure he was nervous 
okay  finished 
i ll do my best 
i ll just be incredibly receptive 
it s in the middle of the next block 
just past the stetson hat sign 
  1270 
  right 
christ  keep going 
  it s 1270  man 
  i said  keep going 
stupid bastards 
any particular place
you want me to go 
731 fifth avenue  pronto 
pronto it will be 
 tires squealing

  hmm  it s heavy  isn t it 
  mm hmm 
my goodness

for a 500 
yeah  you re right 
you found this in your cellar 
mrs  kornpett 
  this morning 
  well  i never have that kind of luck 
do you have any idea of what
i should do with it or what it s worth 
oh  gee  i really don t know 
i ve never even seen one of these 
i could ask our branch manager 
do you mind waiting 
no  not really 
i d like to resolve this somehow 
well  sure  i don t blame you 
let me ask him 
  okay 
  hi 
  oh 
  ready 
in a second 
  did you get your shoes 
  no  they were all awful 
i got some tennis sneakers
so it wouldn t be a total loss 
  you ve gotta get some shoes 
  i know  i know 
tomorrow we ll go into the city 
i ll try bloomingdale s 
i  miller and bendel s 
worse comes to worst 
i ll wear my clogs on sunday 
you re not going to wear clogs
at your wedding 
nobody ll see  em 
  my god 
  what 
look at this 
let s not fight about it 
i ll go into the city tomorrow 
i ll probably find
an acceptable pair of shoes 
  clogs are out of the question 
  will you stop 
  mrs  kornpett 
  yes 
would you mind stepping over
to my office for a moment 
you feeling a little better 
you were smart to order that split pea soup 
that looks delicious  may i 
mmm  it s very nice 
it s a little greasy  but it s very nice 
crumble up some saltines into it  shel 
that will absorb the grease 
shel  when i speak  do you hear me 
do you understand the words 
  yeah 
  well  that s good 
that s a relief 
i was beginning to get worried 
i thought maybe all this excitement
had gotten to you 
let me see if i got this straight 
  you work for the cia 
  that s right 
you ve been with them how long 
twenty years 
since eisenhower 
and you robbed
the united states mint for the cia 
  is that correct 
  completely 
okay  let me ask you a question 
since when is it the policy of the cia
to impress private citizens into their service
without telling them what it s about
so that individuals of high standing
in the community
end up running down the streets
with bullets flying past their heads 
  that was a mistake 
  some mistake 
  thank god nobody was hurt 
  how do you justify such behavior 
shel  i didn t do it lightly 
it was done in the name of something pretty
important which you couldn t understand 
  i couldn t understand 
  no  it is too complicated 
i read the newspapers 
i graduated second in my class 
don t underestimate
the man in the street  buddy 
all right  you got a point 
you re right 
when you re right  you re right 
okay  try and follow me  shel 
this whole thing has to do with a conspiracy
that originated in central america
against the economy
of the united states 
we first got wind of it nine months ago
when they robbed the german mint 
well  actually  they robbed  
they robbed the english mint 
then the german mint 
and then the swiss mint 
  and they never took any money 
  who did this 
  it s a latin american syndicate 
  okay 
  they only took the plates 
  mm hmm 
now  what you have to understand is that
we have information   the agency has  
  the cia 
  you re goddamn right  buddy 
the cia 
we know that these plates
are going down to central america 
and these people intend to run off
billions of dollars of this currency 
  they want to obliterate their debts 
  what debts 
well  all these countries  shel 
they all owe billions of dollars to the west 
and they can never pay it back 
  right  right 
  they re too poor  you know that 
their only hope is worldwide inflation 
but it has to be a huge one 
i mean  so big that paper money
is not worth anything 
  you use it for wallpaper 
  mmm 
now  once they get these plates  
  the ones that i robbed yesterday  
  yes 
which is american dollars 
now they re all set 
set for what 
what do you think s gonna happen
when they start running off this dough 
and suddenly there s trillions of extra
dollars  francs and marks floating around 
you ve got a collapse
of confidence in the currency 
  right 
  people are gonna panic 
  yeah 
  there s gonna be gold riots 
atonal music 
political chaos  mass suicide 
  right 
  yeah 
it s germany before hitler 
  you can see that 
  yeah 
jesus 
i don t know what people are gonna do
when a six pack of budweiser costs  1 200 
oh  that would be awful 
  you think i m bullshitting  don t ya 
  no  i don t  i don t 
  well  they thought i was bullshitting 
  who thought you were bullshitting 
the cia 
i told  em 
i said  fellas  the thing to do
is to rob the us mint 
really rob it  professionally 
with real gangsters and real guns 
get the engraving 
go to central america 
smoke out the action
and nail those bastards 
they thought it was too risky 
turned it down 
wait a minute  w wait a minute 
the cia turned this down 
  i thought you were doing it for them 
  i am 
  well  th then they re behind you 
  no  this i did on my own 
you robbed the united states mint
on your own 
  the cia thought it was too crazy 
  too risky  shel 
so you went ahead and robbed it
on your own  with gangsters 
  you committed a federal crime 
  of course it s federal 
the treasury department is on the case 
  so what happens if you get caught 
  we won t get caught  not if we  
stop the  we  
if you get caught  is the agency gonna
come forward  say it s okay  he works for us 
  no 
  no 
no  i m out in the cold
on this one  shel 
if i get caught  they shred my records 
they say they never heard of me 
and it s 20 years in the slammer 
what about me  i was the one running
through the streets with that goddamn thing 
i was the one in the gutter 
and you were tremendous  shel 
the way you handled yourself 
i can t tell you how impressed i was 
no  i mean this  it s been something
i ve been wanting to say 
you were sensational  shel 
and it s an act of friendship
that i will remember for as long as i live 
  which could be about an hour 
  so what do i got  an hour and a half

a mental  you heard me right 
he s a wild man  that s why 
he d go into very dangerous situations
without any rhyme or reason
and just improvise  you know

the worst thing was that we lost a half dozen
good men who had teamed with him 
horrible  gruesome deaths too 
yeah  real nightmare 
and you re with him right now 
is that right

german bankers will just
throw themselves under the trolley 
widows and orphans
will be left penniless

rioting in the streets and suicides 
fabulous 
and you 
my dear  sweet american friends 
you were here right at the start 
come 
we celebrate 
  i think that i shall never see  
  a poem lovely as a tree  
  a tree whose hungry mouth
is pressed  
  against the earth s
sweet flowing breast  
  a tree that looks at god all day  
    and lifts her leafy arms to pray  
      humming along 
    a tree that may in summer wear  
  this chicken is really sensational 
  do you want to give out the recipe

shelly  i call him 
he s a great dentist from new york 
a city in which 
as you probably know  general 
there are thousands
of spanish speaking people
who stand in dire need
of extensive bridgework 
and this man s death  i m afraid 
would be a crushing blow
to whatever small hopes they might have
for a healthier set of teeth and gums 
 shouting  that was it 
the dental thing  i m a dead man 
but they will have
great memories of you 
 preparen armas 
this is it  my life is over

i really hate to be
a pain in the ass about this 
  don t care if i live or die 
  but the geneva convention stipulates  
  i ve always loved this country 
  that firing squad victims  
and i m afraid we fall into that category  
are required to be given
the option of a blindfold 
  otherwise  you can be reported 
  who is going to report me 
your ghost 
is your ghost going to report me 
   muttering 
   laughing 
general  i insist on at least
a blindfold for shel here 
come on  be a man
