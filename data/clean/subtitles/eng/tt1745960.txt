maverick
maverick
thank you
where am i
earth
maverick
thirtyplus years of service
combat medals
citations
only man to shoot down three
enemy planes in the last 40 years
distinguished
distinguished
distinguished
yet you cant get a promotion
you wont retire
and despite your best efforts
you refuse to die
you should be at least a twostar
admiral by now if not a senator
yet here you are
captain
why is that
its one of
lifes mysteries sir
this isnt a joke
i asked you a question
im where i belong sir
well the navy
doesnt see it that way
not anymore
these planes
youve been testing
captain
one day sooner than later
they wont need pilots at all
pilots that need to sleep
eat take a piss
pilots that disobey orders
all you did was buy some
time for those men out there
the future is coming
and youre not in it
escort this man off the base
take him to his quarters
wait with him
while he packs his gear
i want him on the road to
north island within the hour
north island sir
call came in
with impeccable timing
right as i was driving here to
ground your ass once and for all
it galls me to say it but
for reasons known only to the
almighty and your guardian angel
youve been called back
to topgun
sir you are dismissed captain
the end is inevitable maverick
your kind is headed
for extinction
maybe so sir
but not today
captain pete
maverick mitchell
your reputation precedes you
thank you sir
wasnt a compliment
im admiral beau simpson
im the air boss
i believe you know
admiral bates warlock sir
must admit i wasnt
expecting an invitation back
theyre called orders maverick
you two have
something in common
cyclone here was first
in his class back in 88
actually sir
i finished second
just want to manage
expectations
the target
is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant
built in violation
of a multilateral nato treaty
the uranium produced there
represents a direct threat
to our allies in the region
the pentagon has tasked us
with assembling a strike
team and taking it out
before it becomes
fully operational
the plant sits in an underground
bunker at the end of this valley
said valley is gpsjammed
and defended by an extensive
surfacetoair missile array
serving a limited number
of fifthgeneration fighters
which in turn are backed up by a
plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft
even a few old f14s
seems like were not the only
ones holding on to old relics
whats your read captain
well sir normally this would be
a cakewalk for the f35s stealth
but the gpsjamming
negates that
and a surfacetoair threat necessitates
a lowlevel laserguided strike
tailormade for the f18
i figure
two precision bombs minimum
makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs
that is one hell of a
steep climb out of there
exposing you to all
the surfacetoair missiles
you survive that
its a dogfight
all the way home
all requirements for which
you have realworld experience
not in the same mission sir
no
no someones
not coming back from this
can it be done or not
how soon before the plant
becomes operational
three weeks maybe less
well its been a while since
ive flown an f18 and
im not sure who id trust
to fly the other three
but ill find a way
to make it work
i think you misunderstand
captain
sir
we dont want you to fly it
we want you to teach it
teach sir
weve recalled 12 topgun
graduates from their squadrons
we want you to narrow
that pool down to six
theyll fly the mission
is there a problem captain
you know there is sir
yeah
bradley bradshaw
aka rooster
i understand you used to fly
with his old man
what was his call sign
goose sir
tragic what happened
captain mitchell was
cleared of any wrongdoing
gooses death was an accident
is that how you see it captain
is that how gooses son sees it
with all due respect sir
im not a teacher
you were a topgun
instructor before
that was almost 30 years ago
i lasted two months
its not where i belong
then let me be perfectly blunt
you were not my first choice in
fact you werent even on the list
you are here at the request
of admiral kazansky
now iceman happens to be
a man i deeply admire
and he seems to think that you
have something left to offer the navy
what that is i cant imagine
you dont have to take this job
but let me be clear
this will be your last post
captain
you fly for topgun or you
dont fly for the navy ever again
twenty bucks
you cant get three in a row
oh youve got to be kidding me
pete
penny
what are you doing here
i should ask you the same thing
well that is a long story
i doubt that
yeah
whod you piss off this time
another admiral
exactly
are you mad at me
oh pete
i can never stay mad at you
thats the problem
huh
i got to say north island
is the one place
i thought for sure
id never run into you
mmm
how long you been here
bought this place
about three years ago
three years
mmhmm yeah
not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral
that was three years ago
you must be in a lot of trouble
no way youd come
back here willingly
well
youll sort it out
no i think uh
i think this is it
come on pete
youve been saying that
as long as ive known you
you said it after they busted you
for taking me on a joyride in that f18
then the next thing i know
youre off to bosnia
then iraq both times
you get yourself in trouble
iceman makes a call
and youre back in the air
penny this is different
pete trust me
as improbable
as it seems right now
somehow youll be back in a
fighter plane with your tail on fire
penny
too late
what
you were about to ask me
what time i get off
dont give me that look
im not giving you any look
i swear
it always ends
the same with us pete
lets not start this time
okay
okay

welcome to your special
training detachment

im admiral bates
nawdc commander
youre all topgun graduates
the elite
the best of the best
that was yesterday
the enemys new fifthgeneration
fighter has leveled the playing field
details are few
but you can be sure
we no longer possess
the technological advantage
success now more than ever
comes down to the man or woman
in the box
half of you will make the cut
one of you will
be named mission leader
the other half
will remain in reserve
your instructor
is a topgun graduate
with realworld experience
in every mission aspect
you will be expected to master
his exploits are legendary
and hes considered
to be one of the finest pilots
this program has ever produced
what he has to teach you
may very well mean the
difference between life and death
i give you
captain pete mitchell
call sign maverick

if i shoot either one of
you down you both lose
this guy needs an ego check
well see to that

exercise for nothing sir

holy shit
you see me now
come on lets get it over with
fights on
what is with these two
all right you put us here

you can bail out anytime
how low you want to go rooster
i can go as low as you sir
and thats saying something
whats past is past
for both of us
youd like to believe that
wouldnt you
hard deck is 5000 feet fellas
you are running out of room
altitude your strategy is
about to run us into the ground
whats your move
altitude altitude
altitude
altitude altitude altitude
altitude altitude
pull up pull up
pull up pull up
pull up pull up
you got it
dont think just do
come on rooster you got him

too late you had your chance
thats a kill knock it off
damn it
same old rooster
go see hondo
about your pushups
all right thats enough
rooster
thats enough man
breaking the hard deck insubordination
are you trying to get kicked out
dont worry about it
look im going on this mission
but if you get kicked out you
leave us flying with hangman
talk to me what the hell
was that he pulled my papers
what who
maverick
he pulled my application
to the naval academy
set me back four years
why would he do that
the hard deck is 5000 feet
above ground level
a parameter is set not just
for the safety of our pilots
but for the safety
of their aircraft
5000 feet is not just a rule it is
a law as immutable as gravity
the hard deck will be much
lower for the mission sir
and it will not change
without my approval
especially not
in the middle of an exercise
and that cobra maneuver of yours
that couldve got all three of you killed
i never want to see
that shit again
what exactly do you suppose
you were teaching captain
that as good as they are sir
they still have something to learn
you are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet captain
and theyve been told that
their entire career
while theyve been dropping
bombs from a high altitude
with little to no dog fighting
the parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered
okay you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team
and how to strike the target
and how to come home
and how to come home sir
every mission has its risks
these pilots accept that
i dont sir
every morning
from this day forward
you will brief us on your
instructional plans in writing
and nothing will change
without my express approval
including the hard deck sir
especially the hard deck captain
sir
what is this
its a request to lower
the hard deck sir
to practice a lowlevel bombing
run per the mission parameters
you could learn a thing or two
about timing captain
yo coyote
take a look at this
the man the legend
there he is
no no no
next to him
he look familiar to you
what have we here
bradshaw
as i live and breathe
hey theo you got big
hey mav
amelia
i know i got big
yes
bar opens at 500
no i just came by
to pay off a debt
mom
hey hows your dad
with his wife in hawaii
mom
mav says he owes you money
oh dont worry
about it i insist
thank you captain
consider your tab closed
captain still
a highly decorated captain
finish up
we have to get the boat
to the yard
i cant go what do
you mean you cant go
test tomorrow i have to
study they only told us today
well i cant sail her alone
just use the engine
why are we taking her
to the yard
to fix the engine
mmhmm
i can help
little rougher than i was expecting
you dont say
pull on the back stay
well depower the sails
okay
what does that mean
youre supposed to be
in the navy
i dont sail boats penny
i land on them
its sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane
so how do i do that
you pull on that
green line up there
green line
yep pull it hard
yep crank that winch
right there
tighten the jib
crank it you okay yeah
good
now
you ready
for what
the afterburner
now youre in the navy
thanks for helping out today
im not exactly sure i helped
hmm
dont give me that look
what look
that one
good night pete
night penny
mom is that you
yeah its me
ill make you dinner
okay
time is your greatest enemy
phase one of the mission
will be a lowlevel ingress
attacking in twoplane teams
youll fly along this narrow
canyon to your target
radarguided surfacetoair
missiles defend the area
these sams theyre lethal
but they were designed to protect
the skies above not the canyon below
thats because the enemy knows no one
is insane enough to try and fly below them
thats exactly what
im gonna train you to do
on the day your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum
you exceed this altitude
radar will spot you
and youre dead
your airspeed will be 660 knots
minimum
time to target
two and a half minutes
thats because fifthgeneration
fighters wait at an air base nearby
in a headtohead with these
planes in your f18s youre dead
thats why you need to get in
hit your target and be gone
before these planes even
have a chance of catching you
this makes time
your greatest adversary
youll fly a route in your nav
system that simulates the canyon
the faster you navigate
this canyon
the harder itll be to stay under
the radar of these enemy sams
the tighter the turns
the more intensely
the force of gravity
on your body multiplies
compressing your lungs
forcing the blood
from your brain
impairing your judgment
and reaction time
so for todays lesson were
gonna take it easy on you
max ceiling 300 feet
time to target three minutes
good luck
time to target is one minute 30
we are two seconds behind
increase to 480 knots
we got to move coyote
copy increasing speed
oh
oh shit
why are they dead
we broke the 300foot ceiling
and a sam took us out
no why are they dead
i slowed down and didnt give
her a warning it was my fault
was there a reason you didnt communicate
with your team i was focusing on
one that their family
will accept at the funeral
none sir
why didnt you
anticipate the turn
you were briefed on the terrain
dont tell me
tell it to his family
hangman ease up
the canyons getting tighter
negative payback
increase your speed
youre going too fast man no
harm in being ahead of schedule
damn it slow down
i cant stay on the course
youre gonna hit the wall
watch out watch out
what happened
i flew as fast as i could
kind of like my ass
depended on it
and you put your team in danger
and your wing mans dead
they couldnt keep up
rooster were 20 seconds
behind and dropping
were fine speed is good
increase to 500 knots
negative yale hold your
speed rooster were late
were alive well make
up time in the straightaway
we are not gonna make it
just trust me maintain
your speed we can make it
why are you dead
youre team leader up there
why are you
why is your team dead
sir hes the only one
who made it to the target
a minute late
he gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down
he is dead
you dont know that
youre not flying fast enough
you dont have a second to waste
we made it to the target
and superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out
then its a dogfight against
fifthgeneration fighters
yeah wed still have
a chance in an f18
its not the plane sir
its the pilot
exactly
theres more than one way
to fly this mission
you really dont get it
on this mission
a man flies like maverick here
or a man does not come back
no offense intended
yet somehow you always manage
look i dont mean to criticize
youre conservative thats all
lieutenant
were going into combat son on
a level no living pilots ever seen
not even him
thats no time to be
thinking about the past
whats that supposed
to mean rooster
i cant be the only one that knows
that maverick flew with his old man
thats enough or that maverick
was flying when his old man
lieutenant thats enough
thats enough
you son of a bitch
hey come on
im cool
im cool hey hey
thats enough
hes not cut out for this mission
thats enough
you know it
you know im right
youre all dismissed
maverick
its come back
no one knows
theres nothing else
they can do
even speaking is painful now
sarah im so sorry
admiral
hows my wing man
please dont worry about me
what can i do for you
all right
well roosters still angry
with me about what i did
i thought eventually
he would understand why
i hoped hed forgive me
the mission is less
than three weeks away
the kids not ready
he doesnt want
what i have to give
ice please
dont ask me to send
someone else to die
please dont
dont ask me to send him
send me
i dont know how
im not a teacher ice
im a fighter pilot
a naval aviator
its not what i am
its who i am
how do i teach that
even if i could teach it
its not what rooster wants
its not what the navy wants
thats why they canned me
the last time
the only reason im here is you
if i send him on this mission
he might never come home
and if i dont send him
hell never forgive me
either way
i could lose him forever
i know
i know
the navy needs maverick
the kid needs maverick
thats why i fought for you
thats why youre still here
thank you ice
for everything
one last thing
whos the better pilot
you or me
this is a nice moment
lets not ruin it
i dont know

own mistakes sometimes
not an easy choice
mmm
is that what happened
with rooster
i pulled his papers
from the naval academy
took years off his career
why
his mother never wanted him to
fly not after what happened to goose
she made me promise
before she died so
does rooster know that
he will always resent me
for what i did
why should he resent her too
not an easy choice
hmm
i was trying to be
the father he lost
i just
i wish i wouldve
done it better
but the truth is
i didnt think he was ready
is he ready now
mom im home
i thought you were staying
at karens tonight
karens sick
and ive got homework to do
i should go
you should go
have you had dinner yet
not yet you wanna go out
no its okay
ill make you something
ill be down in a sec
wait not that way
what
look i have an example to set
i cant be bringing guys
home on a first date
this is not our first date
you know what i mean
okay
fine
but this is the last time
i go out your window
well see
no no i mean it
im never gonna leave you again
oh shut up
go on get out of here
just dont
break her heart again
good morning
the uranium enrichment plant
that is your target
will be operational
earlier than expected
raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days time
as a result your mission
has been moved up one week
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation
sir no one here has successfully
flown a lowlevel course
nevertheless youve
been ordered to move on
captain
we have one week left
to focus on phase two
its the most difficult stage
of the mission
its a popup strike
with a steep dive
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles
two pairs of f18s will fly
in a welded wing formation
teamwork precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential
to both the missions success
and your survival
as you know the plant rests
between two mountains
on final approach youll
invert directly into a steep dive
this allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude
and the only possible
attack angle
your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide
the twoseat aircraft
will paint the target
with a laser bullseye
the first pair
will breach the reactor
by dropping a laserguided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch
this will create an opening
for the second pair
thats miracle number one
the second team
will deliver the kill shot
and destroy the target
thats miracle number two
if either team
misses the target
thats a miss
the mission is a failure
damn it
egress
is a steep highg climb out
to avoid hitting this mountain
a steep climb at that speed
youre pulling at least eight gs
nine minimum
the stress limit
of the f18s airframe is 75
thats the accepted limit
to survive this mission
youll pull beyond that
even if it means
bending your airframe
youll be pulling so hard youll
weigh close to 2000 pounds
your skull
crushing your spine
your lungs imploding like an
elephants sitting on your chest
fighting with everything you
have just to keep from blacking out
and this is where youll be
at your most vulnerable
this is coffin corner
assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain
youll climb straight up into enemy
radar while losing all of your airspeed
within seconds youll be
fired upon by enemy sams
youve all faced sustained
gs before but this
this is gonna take you and
your aircraft to the breaking point
sir is this even achievable
the answer to that question
will come down
to the pilot in the box
talk to me bob we are
12 seconds late on target
we gotta move we gotta
move copy try to stay with me
huh wait whos that
blue team youve been spotted

the hospital overnight for observation
theyre gonna be okay
thats good
ive never lost a wing man
youre lucky
fly long enough itll happen
there will be others
easy for you to say
no wife
no kids
nobody to mourn you
when you burn in
go home
just get some sleep
whyd you pull my papers
at the academy
why did you stand in my way
you werent ready
ready for what
huh ready to fly like you no
ready to forget the book
trust your instincts
dont think just do
you think up there
youre dead believe me
my dad believed in you
im not gonna make
the same mistake
maverick
ready aim fire
ready
aim
fire
ready
aim
fire
i can only imagine what
you must be feeling right now
take some time
whatever you need
i appreciate that sir but
there is no time the mission
ill be taking over
the training from here
sir
we both know you didnt
want this job captain
sir theyre not ready it was
your job to get them ready
sir they have to believe
that this mission can be flown
and all youve managed to do
is teach them that it cant
sir youre grounded captain
permanently
sir that is all
i heard
im sorry
what are you gonna do
ice is gone
what choice do i have
youll have to find a
way back on your own
no penny
im out
this is over
pete
if you lost
your wing man up there
youd keep fighting
you wouldnt just give up
those are your pilots
if anything happens to them
youll never forgive yourself
i dont know what to do
but youll find a way
i know you will
captain mitchell
is no longer your instructor
and as of today there are
new mission parameters
time to target
is now four minutes
youll be entering the
valley level at reduced speed
not to exceed 420 knots
sir wont we be giving
their planes time to intercept
well lieutenant you have a
fighting chance against enemy aircraft
what are the odds of surviving a
headon collision with a mountain
youll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude
level with the north wall
gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target
but you will avoid
the highg climb out
well be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles
who the hell is that
maverick to range control
entering point alpha
confirm green range
uh maverick range control
uh green range is confirmed
i dont see an event scheduled
for you sir
well im going anyway
nice
setting time to target
two minutes 15 seconds
215 thats impossible
final attack point
mavericks inbound
popping in three two one
bombs away
bullseye holy shit
yes
damn
you have put me in a
difficult position captain
on the one hand you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown
perhaps the only way
it can be survived
on the other hand
you did it by stealing a
multimilliondollar military aircraft
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again
iceman is no longer here
to protect you
i have everything i need
to have you courtmartialed
and dishonorably discharged
so what do i do
risk the lives of my pilots
and perhaps the success
of this mission
or
risk my career
by appointing you team leader
sir i think the admirals asking
a rhetorical question captain
talk to me goose
captain mitchell
youre where you belong
make us proud
it has been an honor
flying with you
each one of you represents
the best of the best
this is a very specific mission
my choice is a reflection
of that and nothing more
choose your two foxtrot teams
payback and fanboy
phoenix and bob
and your wing man
rooster
the rest of you will stand by
on the carrier
for any reserve role
thats required
dismissed
your target
is a clear and present threat
a secret uranium enrichment
site under rogue state control
its an underground bunker
tucked between
these two mountains
your route of ingress is heavily
defended by surfacetoair missiles
backed up
by fifthgeneration fighters
once your f18 strike team
crosses the border
tomahawk missiles
from the uss leyte gulf
will launch a synchronized
strike on the enemys airfield here
this will knock out
their runway
but youll have to contend with
any planes already in the air
the moment those tomahawks hit
the enemy will know youre coming
your time to target
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds
any longer than that
and you will be exposed
to any aircraft
the tomahawks may have missed
this is what youve all
been training for
come home safely
you give em hell
sir
