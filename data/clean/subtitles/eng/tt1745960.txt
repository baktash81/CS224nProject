maverick 
maverick 
thank you 
where am i 
earth 
maverick 
thirty plus years of service 
combat medals 
citations 
only man to shoot down three
enemy planes in the last 40 years 
 distinguished  
 distinguished  
 distinguished  
yet you can t get a promotion 
you won t retire 
and despite your best efforts 
you refuse to die 
you should be at least a two star
admiral by now  if not a senator 
yet here you are 
captain 
why is that 
it s one of
life s mysteries  sir 
this isn t a joke 
i asked you a question 
i m where i belong  sir 
well  the navy
doesn t see it that way 
not anymore 
these planes
you ve been testing 
captain 
one day  sooner than later 
they won t need pilots at all 
pilots that need to sleep 
eat  take a piss 
pilots that disobey orders 
all you did was buy some
time for those men out there 
the future is coming 
and you re not in it 
escort this man off the base 
take him to his quarters 
wait with him
while he packs his gear 
i want him on the road to
north island within the hour 
north island  sir 
call came in
with impeccable timing 
right as i was driving here to
ground your ass once and for all 
it galls me to say it  but   
for reasons known only to the
almighty and your guardian angel   
you ve been called back
to topgun 
sir  you are dismissed  captain 
the end is inevitable  maverick 
your kind is headed
for extinction 
maybe so  sir 
but not today 
captain pete
 maverick  mitchell 
your reputation precedes you 
thank you  sir 
wasn t a compliment 
i m admiral beau simpson 
i m the air boss 
i believe you know
admiral bates  warlock  sir 
must admit  i wasn t
expecting an invitation back 
they re called orders  maverick 
you two have
something in common 
cyclone here was first
in his class back in  88 
actually  sir 
i finished second 
just want to manage
expectations 
the target   
is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant
built in violation
of a multilateral nato treaty 
the uranium produced there
represents a direct threat
to our allies in the region 
the pentagon has tasked us
with assembling a strike
team and taking it out
before it becomes
fully operational 
the plant sits in an underground
bunker at the end of this valley 
said valley is gps jammed
and defended by an extensive
surface to air missile array
serving a limited number
of fifth generation fighters 
which in turn are backed up by a
plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft 
even a few old f 14s 
seems like we re not the only
ones holding on to old relics 
what s your read  captain 
well  sir  normally this would be
a cakewalk for the f 35 s stealth 
but the gps jamming
negates that 
and a surface to air threat necessitates
a low level laser guided strike
tailor made for the f 18 
i figure 
two precision bombs  minimum 
makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs 
that is one hell of a
steep climb out of there 
exposing you to all
the surface to air missiles 
you survive that 
it s a dogfight
all the way home 
all requirements for which
you have real world experience 
not in the same mission  sir 
no 
no  someone s
not coming back from this 
can it be done or not 
how soon before the plant
becomes operational 
three weeks  maybe less 
well  it s been a while since
i ve flown an f 18  and   
i m not sure who i d trust
to fly the other three 
but i ll find a way
to make it work 
i think you misunderstand 
captain 
sir 
we don t want you to fly it 
we want you to teach it 
teach  sir 
we ve recalled 12 topgun
graduates from their squadrons 
we want you to narrow
that pool down to six 
they ll fly the mission 
is there a problem  captain 
you know there is  sir 
yeah 
bradley bradshaw 
aka  rooster  
i understand you used to fly
with his old man 
what was his call sign 
 goose   sir 
tragic what happened 
captain mitchell was
cleared of any wrongdoing 
goose s death was an accident 
is that how you see it  captain 
is that how goose s son sees it 
with all due respect  sir 
i m not a teacher 
you were a topgun
instructor before 
that was almost 30 years ago 
i lasted two months 
it s not where i belong 
then let me be perfectly blunt 
you were not my first choice  in
fact  you weren t even on the list 
you are here at the request
of admiral kazansky 
now  iceman happens to be
a man i deeply admire 
and he seems to think that you
have something left to offer the navy 
what that is  i can t imagine 
you don t have to take this job 
but let me be clear 
this will be your last post 
captain 
you fly for topgun  or you
don t fly for the navy ever again 
twenty bucks
you can t get three in a row 
oh  you ve got to be kidding me 
pete 
penny 
what are you doing here 
i should ask you the same thing 
well  that is a long story 
i doubt that 
yeah 
who d you piss off this time 
another admiral 
exactly 
are you mad at me 
oh  pete 
i can never stay mad at you 
that s the problem 
huh 
i got to say  north island
is the one place
i thought for sure
i d never run into you 
mmm 
how long you been here 
bought this place
about three years ago 
three years 
mm hmm  yeah 
not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral 
that was three years ago 
you must be in a lot of trouble 
no way you d come
back here willingly 
well 
you ll sort it out 
no  i think  uh   
i think this is it 
come on  pete 
you ve been saying that
as long as i ve known you 
you said it after they busted you
for taking me on a joyride in that f 18 
then the next thing i know 
you re off to bosnia 
then iraq  both times 
you get yourself in trouble 
iceman makes a call 
and you re back in the air 
penny  this is different 
pete  trust me 
as improbable
as it seems right now 
somehow you ll be back in a
fighter plane with your tail on fire 
penny   
too late 
what 
you were about to ask me
what time i get off 
don t give me that look 
i m not giving you any look 
i swear 
it always ends
the same with us  pete 
let s not start this time 
okay 
okay

and dance the blues

attention on deck 
morning 
welcome to your special
training detachment 
be seated 
i m admiral bates 
nawdc commander 
you re all topgun graduates 
the elite 
the best of the best 
that was yesterday 
the enemy s new fifth generation
fighter has leveled the playing field 
details are few 
but you can be sure
we no longer possess
the technological advantage 
success  now more than ever 
comes down to the man or woman
in the box 
half of you will make the cut 
one of you will
be named mission leader 
the other half
will remain in reserve 
your instructor
is a topgun graduate
with real world experience
in every mission aspect
you will be expected to master 
his exploits are legendary 
and he s considered
to be one of the finest pilots
this program has ever produced 
what he has to teach you
may very well mean the
difference between life and death 
i give you
captain pete mitchell 
call sign   maverick  
good morning 
the f 18 natops 
it contains everything they want
you to know about your aircraft 
i m assuming you know the book
inside and out 
damn right 
damn straight 
you got it 
so does your enemy 
and we re off

push beyond 
today we ll start with
what you only think you know

or else i shoot back 
if i shoot either one of
you down  you both lose 
this guy needs an ego check 
we ll see to that 
what say we put some skin in the
game  what do you have in mind

they don t call it an
exercise for nothing  sir

it seems like he s got you rattled 
that s none of your business 
now where the hell is he 
been here the whole time 
holy shit 
you see me now 
come on  let s get it over with 
fight s on 
what is with these two 
all right  you put us here 
how you gonna get yourself out 
you can bail out anytime 
how low you want to go  rooster 
i can go as low as you  sir 
and that s saying something 
what s past is past 
for both of us 
you d like to believe that 
wouldn t you 
hard deck is 5 000 feet  fellas 
you are running out of room 
altitude  your strategy is
about to run us into the ground 
  what s your move 
  altitude  altitude 
altitude 
altitude  altitude  altitude 
altitude  altitude 
pull up  pull up 
pull up  pull up 
pull up  pull up 
you got it 
don t think  just do 
come on  rooster  you got him 
drop down and take the shot 
it s too low 
too late  you had your chance 
that s a kill  knock it off 
damn it 
same old rooster 
go see hondo
about your push ups 
all right  that s enough 
rooster 
that s enough  man 
breaking the hard deck  insubordination 
are you trying to get kicked out 
don t worry about it 
look  i m going on this mission 
but if you get kicked out  you
leave us flying with hangman 
talk to me  what the hell
was that  he pulled my papers 
what  who 
maverick 
he pulled my application
to the naval academy 
set me back four years 
why would he do that 
the hard deck is 5 000 feet
above ground level 
a parameter is set not just
for the safety of our pilots 
but for the safety
of their aircraft 
5 000 feet is not just a rule  it is
a law  as immutable as gravity 
the hard deck will be much
lower for the mission  sir 
and it will not change
without my approval 
especially not
in the middle of an exercise 
and that cobra maneuver of yours 
that could ve got all three of you killed 
i never want to see
that shit again 
what exactly do you suppose
you were teaching  captain 
that as good as they are  sir 
they still have something to learn 
you are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet  captain 
and they ve been told that
their entire career 
while they ve been dropping
bombs from a high altitude
with little to no dog fighting 
the parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered 
okay  you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team
and how to strike the target 
and how to come home 
and how to come home  sir 
every mission has its risks 
these pilots accept that 
i don t  sir 
every morning 
from this day forward 
you will brief us on your
instructional plans in writing 
and nothing will change
without my express approval 
including the hard deck  sir 
especially the hard deck  captain 
sir 
what is this 
it s a request to lower
the hard deck  sir 
to practice a low level bombing
run per the mission parameters 
you could learn a thing or two
about timing  captain 
yo  coyote 
take a look at this 
the man  the legend 
there he is 
no  no  no 
next to him 
he look familiar to you 
what have we here 
bradshaw 
as i live and breathe 
hey  theo  you got big 
hey  mav 
amelia 
i know  i got big 
yes 
bar opens at 5 00 
no  i just came by
to pay off a debt 
mom 
hey  how s your dad 
with his wife  in hawaii 
mom 
mav says he owes you money 
oh  don t worry
about it  i insist 
thank you  captain 
consider your tab closed 
captain  still 
a highly decorated captain 
finish up 
we have to get the boat
to the yard 
i can t go  what do
you mean  you can t go 
test tomorrow  i have to
study  they only told us today 
well  i can t sail her alone 
just use the engine 
why are we taking her
to the yard 
to fix the engine 
mm hmm 
i can help 
little rougher than i was expecting 
you don t say 
pull on the back stay 
we ll de power the sails 
okay 
what does that mean 
you re supposed to be
in the navy 
i don t sail boats  penny 
i land on them 
it s sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane 
so how do i do that 
you pull on that
green line up there 
green line 
yep  pull it hard 
yep  crank that winch
right there 
tighten the jib 
crank it  you okay  yeah 
good 
now 
you ready 
for what 
the afterburner 
now you re in the navy 
thanks for helping out today 
i m not exactly sure i helped 
hmm 
don t give me that look 
what look 
that one 
good night  pete 
night  penny 
mom  is that you 
yeah  it s me 
i ll make you dinner 
okay 
time is your greatest enemy 
phase one of the mission
will be a low level ingress
attacking in two plane teams 
you ll fly along this narrow
canyon to your target 
radar guided surface to air
missiles defend the area 
these sams  they re lethal 
but they were designed to protect
the skies above  not the canyon below 
that s because the enemy knows no one
is insane enough to try and fly below them 
that s exactly what
i m gonna train you to do 
on the day  your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum 
you exceed this altitude   
   radar will spot you
and you re dead 
your airspeed will be 660 knots
minimum 
time to target 
two and a half minutes 
that s because fifth generation
fighters wait at an air base nearby 
in a head to head with these
planes in your f 18s  you re dead 
that s why you need to get in 
hit your target and be gone
before these planes even
have a chance of catching you 
this makes time
your greatest adversary 
you ll fly a route in your nav
system that simulates the canyon 
the faster you navigate
this canyon 
the harder it ll be to stay under
the radar of these enemy sams 
the tighter the turns 
the more intensely
the force of gravity
on your body multiplies   
   compressing your lungs   
   forcing the blood
from your brain   
   impairing your judgment
and reaction time 
so for today s lesson  we re
gonna take it easy on you 
max ceiling  300 feet 
time to target  three minutes 
good luck 
time to target is one minute 30 
we are two seconds behind 
increase to 480 knots 
we got to move  coyote 
copy  increasing speed 
oh 
oh  shit 
why are they dead 
we broke the 300 foot ceiling 
and a sam took us out 
no  why are they dead 
i slowed down and didn t give
her a warning  it was my fault 
was there a reason you didn t communicate
with your team  i was focusing on   
one that their family
will accept at the funeral 
none  sir 
why didn t you
anticipate the turn 
you were briefed on the terrain 
don t tell me 
tell it to his family 
hangman  ease up 
the canyon s getting tighter 
negative  payback 
increase your speed 
you re going too fast  man  no
harm in being ahead of schedule 
damn it  slow down 
i can t stay on the course 
you re gonna hit the wall 
watch out  watch out 
  what happened 
  i flew as fast as i could 
kind of like my ass
depended on it 
and you put your team in danger 
and your wing man s dead 
they couldn t keep up 
rooster  we re 20 seconds
behind and dropping 
we re fine  speed is good 
increase to 500 knots 
negative  yale  hold your
speed  rooster  we re late 
we re alive  we ll make
up time in the straightaway 
we are not gonna make it 
just trust me  maintain
your speed  we can make it 
why are you dead 
you re team leader up there 
why are you 
why is your team dead 
sir  he s the only one
who made it to the target 
a minute late 
he gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down 
he is dead 
you don t know that 
you re not flying fast enough 
you don t have a second to waste 
we made it to the target 
and superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out 
then it s a dogfight  against
fifth generation fighters 
yeah  we d still have
a chance  in an f 18 
it s not the plane  sir 
it s the pilot 
exactly 
there s more than one way
to fly this mission 
you really don t get it 
on this mission 
a man flies like maverick here 
or a man does not come back 
no offense intended 
yet somehow you always manage 
look  i don t mean to criticize 
you re conservative  that s all 
lieutenant 
we re going into combat  son  on
a level no living pilot s ever seen 
not even him 
that s no time to be
thinking about the past 
what s that supposed
to mean  rooster 
i can t be the only one that knows
that maverick flew with his old man 
that s enough  or that maverick
was flying when his old man   
lieutenant  that s enough 
that s enough 
you son of a bitch 
hey  come on 
i m cool 
i m cool  hey  hey 
  that s enough 
  he s not cut out for this mission 
that s enough 
you know it 
you know i m right 
you re all dismissed 
maverick 
it s come back 
no one knows 
there s nothing else
they can do 
even speaking is painful now 
sarah  i m so sorry 
admiral 
how s my wing man 
please  don t worry about me 
what can i do for you 
all right 
well  rooster s still angry
with me about what i did 
i thought eventually
he would understand why 
i hoped he d forgive me 
the mission is less
than three weeks away 
the kid s not ready 
he doesn t want
what i have to give 
ice  please 
don t ask me to send
someone else to die 
please don t   
don t ask me to send him 
send me 
i don t know how 
i m not a teacher  ice 
i m a fighter pilot 
a naval aviator 
it s not what i am 
it s who i am 
how do i teach that 
even if i could teach it 
it s not what rooster wants 
it s not what the navy wants 
that s why they canned me
the last time 
the only reason i m here is you 
if i send him on this mission 
he might never come home 
and if i don t send him 
he ll never forgive me 
either way 
i could lose him forever 
i know 
i know 
the navy needs maverick 
the kid needs maverick 
that s why i fought for you 
that s why you re still here 
thank you  ice 
for everything 
one last thing 
who s the better pilot 
you or me 
this is a nice moment 
let s not ruin it 
  i don t know
what you ve been told  
  but time is running out
no need to take it slow  
  i m steppin  to ya
toe to toe  
all right  all right

should i go 
before amelia gets back 
she ll be at her friend s
house tonight  oh  good 
you and amelia  you seem   
a lot closer
than when i last saw you 
yeah  yeah  we are 
how do you manage 
well 
you know  she always wanted more
freedom than i thought she was ready for 
hmm  where d she
get that from  i wonder 
i guess i realized
i also had to trust her 
let her make some of her
own mistakes sometimes 
not an easy choice 
mmm 
is that what happened
with rooster 
i pulled his papers
from the naval academy 
took years off his career 
why 
his mother never wanted him to
fly  not after what happened to goose 
she made me promise
before she died  so   
does rooster know that 
he will always resent me
for what i did 
why should he resent her too 
not an easy choice 
hmm 
i was trying to be
the father he lost 
i just   
i wish i would ve
done it better 
but the truth is   
i didn t think he was ready 
is he ready now 
mom  i m home 
i thought you were staying
at karen s tonight 
karen s sick 
and i ve got homework to do 
i should go 
you should go 
have you had dinner yet 
not yet  you wanna go out 
no  it s okay 
i ll make you something 
i ll be down in a sec 
wait  not that way 
what 
look  i have an example to set 
i can t be bringing guys
home on a first date 
this is not our first date 
you know what i mean 
okay 
fine 
but this is the last time
i go out your window 
we ll see 
no  no  i mean it 
i m never gonna leave you again 
oh  shut up 
go on  get out of here 
just don t
break her heart again 
good morning 
the uranium enrichment plant
that is your target
will be operational
earlier than expected 
raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days  time 
as a result  your mission
has been moved up one week
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation 
sir  no one here has successfully
flown a low level course 
nevertheless  you ve
been ordered to move on 
captain 
we have one week left
to focus on phase two 
it s the most difficult stage
of the mission 
it s a pop up strike
with a steep dive 
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles 
two pairs of f 18s will fly
in a welded wing formation 
teamwork  precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential
to both the mission s success
and your survival 
as you know  the plant rests
between two mountains 
on final approach  you ll
invert directly into a steep dive 
this allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude
and the only possible
attack angle 
your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide 
the two seat aircraft
will paint the target
with a laser bull s eye 
the first pair
will breach the reactor
by dropping a laser guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch 
this will create an opening
for the second pair 
that s miracle number one 
the second team
will deliver the kill shot   
   and destroy the target 
that s miracle number two 
if either team
misses the target   
  that s a miss 
     the mission is a failure 
damn it 
egress
is a steep high g climb out
to avoid hitting this mountain 
a steep climb at that speed 
you re pulling at least eight g s 
nine  minimum 
the stress limit
of the f 18 s airframe is 7 5 
that s the accepted limit 
to survive this mission 
you ll pull beyond that 
even if it means
bending your airframe 
you ll be pulling so hard  you ll
weigh close to 2 000 pounds 
your skull
crushing your spine   
   your lungs imploding like an
elephant s sitting on your chest 
fighting with everything you
have just to keep from blacking out 
and this is where you ll be
at your most vulnerable 
this is coffin corner 
assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain 
you ll climb straight up into enemy
radar while losing all of your airspeed 
within seconds  you ll be
fired upon by enemy sams 
you ve all faced sustained
g s before  but this   
this is gonna take you and
your aircraft to the breaking point 
sir  is this even achievable 
the answer to that question
will come down
to the pilot in the box 
talk to me  bob  we are
12 seconds late on target 
we gotta move  we gotta
move  copy  try to stay with me 
huh  wait  who s that 
blue team  you ve been spotted 
shit  it s maverick 
what the hell is he doing here 
i m a bandit on course to intercept 
blue team  what are you gonna do 
he s 20 miles left  ten o clock 
700 knots closure 
your call 
what do you want to do 
continue  we re close 
stay on target 
he s swinging around to the
north  stand by for pop up 
be ready on that laser  bob 
copy  i m on it 
blue team 
bandit is still closing 
popping now 
talk to me  bob 
where s maverick 
he s five miles out 
he s coming fast 
target s in sight 
where s my laser  bob

that s good 
i ve never lost a wing man 
you re lucky 
fly long enough  it ll happen 
there will be others 
easy for you to say 
no wife 
no kids 
nobody to mourn you
when you burn in 
go home 
just get some sleep 
why d you pull my papers
at the academy 
why did you stand in my way 
you weren t ready 
ready for what 
huh  ready to fly like you  no 
ready to forget the book 
trust your instincts 
don t think  just do 
you think up there 
you re dead  believe me 
my dad believed in you 
i m not gonna make
the same mistake 
maverick 
ready  aim  fire 
ready 
aim 
fire 
ready 
aim 
fire 
i can only imagine what
you must be feeling right now 
take some time 
whatever you need 
i appreciate that  sir  but
there is no time  the mission   
i ll be taking over
the training from here 
sir 
we both know you didn t
want this job  captain 
sir  they re not ready  it was
your job to get them ready 
sir  they have to believe
that this mission can be flown 
and all you ve managed to do
is teach them that it can t 
sir    you re grounded  captain 
permanently 
sir    that is all 
i heard 
i m sorry 
what are you gonna do 
ice is gone 
what choice do i have 
you ll have to find a
way back on your own 
no  penny 
i m out 
this is over 
pete 
if you lost
your wing man up there 
you d keep fighting 
you wouldn t just give up 
those are your pilots 
if anything happens to them 
you ll never forgive yourself 
i don t know what to do 
but you ll find a way 
i know you will 
captain mitchell
is no longer your instructor 
and as of today  there are
new mission parameters 
time to target
is now four minutes 
you ll be entering the
valley level at reduced speed 
not to exceed 420 knots 
sir  won t we be giving
their planes time to intercept 
well  lieutenant  you have a
fighting chance against enemy aircraft 
what are the odds of surviving a
head on collision with a mountain 
you ll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude 
level with the north wall 
gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target 
but you will avoid
the high g climb out 
we ll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles 
who the hell is that 
maverick to range control 
entering point alpha 
confirm green range 
uh  maverick  range control 
uh  green range is confirmed 
i don t see an event scheduled
for you  sir 
well  i m going anyway 
nice 
setting time to target 
two minutes 15 seconds 
2 15  that s impossible 
final attack point 
maverick s inbound 
popping in three  two  one 
bombs away 
bull s eye  holy shit 
yes 
damn 
you have put me in a
difficult position  captain 
on the one hand  you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown 
perhaps the only way
it can be survived 
on the other hand 
you did it by stealing a
multimillion dollar military aircraft
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again 
iceman is no longer here
to protect you 
i have everything i need
to have you court martialed
and dishonorably discharged 
so what do i do 
risk the lives of my pilots
and perhaps the success
of this mission
or   
risk my career
by appointing you team leader 
sir    i think the admiral s asking
a rhetorical question  captain 
talk to me  goose 
captain mitchell 
you re where you belong 
make us proud 
it has been an honor
flying with you 
each one of you represents
the best of the best 
this is a very specific mission 
my choice is a reflection
of that and nothing more 
choose your two foxtrot teams 
payback and fanboy 
phoenix and bob 
and your wing man 
rooster 
the rest of you will stand by
on the carrier
for any reserve role
that s required 
dismissed 
your target
is a clear and present threat 
a secret uranium enrichment
site under rogue state control 
it s an underground bunker 
tucked between
these two mountains 
your route of ingress is heavily
defended by surface to air missiles
backed up
by fifth generation fighters 
once your f 18 strike team
crosses the border 
tomahawk missiles
from the uss leyte gulf
will launch a synchronized
strike on the enemy s airfield here 
this will knock out
their runway 
but you ll have to contend with
any planes already in the air 
the moment those tomahawks hit 
the enemy will know you re coming 
your time to target
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds 
any longer than that 
and you will be exposed
to any aircraft
the tomahawks may have missed 
this is what you ve all
been training for 
come home safely 
you give  em hell

i just want to say
