i only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me
and i do believe i have
one two three four
five witnesses

caterwauling down to a minimum

of inquiry with young django

nickering

now as to you poor devils
so as i see it when it comes
to the subject of what to do
next
you gentlemen have two choices
one once im gone you could
lift that beast off the
remaining speck
then carry him
to the nearest town
which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came
or two you could unshackle
yourselves take that rifle
put a bullet in his head
bury the two of them deep
and then make your way to
a more enlightened area
of this country
choice is yours
oh and on the off chance
there are any astronomy
aficionados amongst you
the north star is that one
tata clucking
now wait a minute fellas
lets talk about this
lantern crashing
chains rattling
you gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this
im not a bad guy
im just doin my job
blueberry didnt i
give you my last apple
tell you what boys
take me to the doc in el paso
ill get you your freedom
gun cocking
no no please
gunshot echoing
dogs barking nearby
squeaking
all right now
id like you to
take two of these tonight
coughing
and then in the morning
thats a nigger on a horse
whats everybody staring at
they aint never seen
no nigger on a horse before
goats bleating
whoa
good morning innkeeper
two beers for
two weary travelers
its still a bit early
we wont be open
for another hour
by then well be
servin breakfast
gasping whoa whoa whoa
whoa what the hell you think
youre doing boy
get that nigger outta here
panting help help
innkeeper
remember get the sheriff
not the marshal
man sheriff help
alas
now we must act
as our own bartender
sit down my boy
what kind of dentist are you
chortles
despite that cart i havent
practiced dentistry in five
years
but these days
i practice a new profession
bounty hunter
do you know what
a bounty hunter is
no
well
the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash
a bounty hunter
deals in corpses
tsking hat
prost
the state places
a bounty on a mans head
i track that man i find
that man i kill that man
after ive killed him
i transport that mans corpse
back to the authorities
sometimes thats
easier said than done
i show that corpse to the
authorities proving yes
indeed
i truly have killed him
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty
so like slavery
its a flesh for cash business
whats a bounty
its like a reward
you kill people
and they give you a reward
certain people yeah
bad people
ah badder they are
bigger the reward
which brings me to you
and i must admit im at a bit
of a quandary when it comes to
you
on one hand i despise slavery
on the other hand
i need your help
if youre not in a position
to refuse all the better
so for the time being im
gonna make this slavery malarkey
work to my benefit
still having said that
i feel guilty
so i would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement
im looking for
the brittle brothers
however at this endeavor
im at a slight disadvantage
insofar as i dont know
what they look like
but you do dont ya
i know what they
look like all right
good so heres my agreement
you travel with me
until we find them
where we goin
i hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in gatlinburg
but i dont know where
that means we visit every
plantation in gatlinburg
till we find em
and when we find them you point
them out and i kill them
you do that i agree
to give you your freedom
25 per brittle brother
thats 75
and as if on cue
here comes the sheriff
scoffs
ok boys funs over
come on out
overlapping chatter
all right folks calm down
go about your business
these jokers will be gone soon
now why yall wanna come
into my town and start trouble
and scare all these nice people

nothing better to do
than to come into
bill sharps town

metal springing noise
sheriff screaming
crowd gasping
groaning
woman screams

groaning
yelling
shot echoing
woman gasps
crowd screaming

im a servant of the court
the man lying dead in the dirt
who the good people of daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their
sheriff who went by the
name of bill sharp
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of willard peck
with a price
on his head of 200
now thats 200 dead or alive
the hell you say
im aware this is probably
disconcerting news
but im willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff
sometime in the past two years
yeah
schultz i know this
because three years ago
he was rustling cattle from the
bc corrigan cattle company of
lubbock texas
now this is a
warrant made out by
circuit court judge henry allen

dead or alive

they were goin

you know them by the name of
shaffer but the butchers real
name was brittle

we were operating
within our legal boundaries
i realize passions are high

for taking deadly force
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty
is youll be hung by the neck

how you know broomhildas
first masters was german
broomhilda is a german name
if they named her it stands
to reason theyd be german
lots of gals where
youre from named broomhilda
broomhilda is the name
of a character
in the most popular
of all the german legends
theres a story
about broomhilda
oh yes there is
do you know it
oh every german knows
that story
would you like me to tell you
well broomhilda was a princess
she was a daughter of wotan
god of all gods
anyway her father
is really mad at her
what she do
i cant exactly remember
she disobeys him in some way
so he puts her
on top of the mountain
broomhildas on a mountain
its a german legend
theres always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere
and he puts a firebreathing
dragon there to guard the
mountain
and he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire
and there
broomhilda shall remain
unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her
does a fella arise
yes django
as a matter of fact he does
a fella named siegfried
does siegfried save her
quite spectacularly so
he scales the mountain
because hes not afraid of it
he slays the dragon
because hes not afraid of him
and he walks through hellfire
because broomhildas
worth it
i know how he feel
i think im just
starting to realize that
now look django
i dont doubt that one day
youll save your lady love
but i cant let you go to
greenville in a good conscience
a slave auction town in
mississippi isnt the place
for you to visit
free or not
its just too dangerous
but let me ask you a question
how do you like the
bounty hunting business
kill white folks
and they pay you for it
whats not to like
now i have to admit
we make a good team
i thought you was mad at me for
killin big john and lil raj
yeah on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous
but normally
thats a good thing
howd you like to
partner up for the winter
what you mean partner up
you work with me through the
winter till the snow melts
i give you
a third of my bounties
so we make some money this
winter and when the snow melts
ill take you
to greenville myself
and well find
where they sent your wife
why you care what happen to me
why you care if i find my wife
frankly
ive never given anybody
their freedom before
and now that i have i feel
vaguely responsible for you
plus when a german meets a real
life siegfried thats kind of a
big deal
as a german im obliged
to help you on your quest
to rescue your
beloved broomhilda

schultz
broomhilda von shaft age 27
r on right cheek
calvin candie
he owns the fourth biggest
cotton plantation in
mississippi candyland
candyland
oh so youve heard of it
aint no slave aint
heard of candyland
well apparently
thats where your wife is
and thats the repellant
gentleman who owns her
sighs
lets just hope she works
in the house not in the field
oh no she aint
no field nigger
she she pretty
and she talk good too
but when they tore
her back up and then they
burned that runaway r
on her cheek
they goddamned her
yells
sizzling
screaming
she aint no field nigger
but she aint good enough
for the house no more either
they gonna try to
make her a comfort girl
whats a comfort oh
not while i got freedom
not while i got my gun
so do we offer to buy her
so
say
a man wants to buy a horse
needs to buy a horse
he walks up to the farmers
farm and he knocks on the
farmers door
and asks the farmer
to buy his horse
and do you know
what the farmer says
the farmer says no
well i say fuck that farmer
and im stealin that horse
fair enough but now youre
a horse thief and they hang
horse thieves
not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner
because the horse
is still his property
we need her
and we need a bill of sale
well if we aint gonna try to
buy her then how we gonna get
her
may i offer an
alternative plan of action
go ahead
so the man walks up
to the farmers farm
he knocks on
the farmers door
and asks not to buy
the horse but the farm
and makes an offer
so ridiculous
the farmer is forced to say yes
we gonna offer
to buy candyland
no its far too big
but apparently this farmer
aint all about the farm
how much do you know
about mandingo fighting
what
can you convincingly
masquerade as someone
who is an expert
on mandingo fighting

indeed
may we stop for a moment so i
may put a word in my mans ear

it would be good if i could have
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant
you mind telling me
what the hell you doing
i confirmed that
broomhildas at candyland
youre sure its her
he didnt call her by name
but shes a young lady
whip marks on her back

not wise to assume
in this instance
i think its pretty safe
point being dont get
so carried away with your
retribution
you lose sight
of why were here
you think i lost
sight of that
yes i do
stop antagonizing candie
youre going to blow this whole
charade or more than likely get

im intriguing him
youre yelling abuse
at these poor slaves
i recall the man who had me kill
another man in front of his son

you remember that
yeah of course i remember
what you said was that
this is my world
and in my world
you gotta get dirty

look monsieur candie they were
all fine specimens no doubt
about it
but the best three by far
were samson
whats that other ones name
goldie
goldie and eskimo joe
by the way why is
he called eskimo joe
chuckles you never know how
these nigger nicknames get
started
his name was joe maybe one day
he said he was cold who knows
all laugh
well regardless samsons
your best we all know that
you will never sell him and
i can see why hes a champion
hmhm
all three are champions
samsons the champion
them other two pretty good
calvin now whats
this nigger you let
its all right its all right
you have to understand
monsieur candie
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game
i do have a little bit of a
background in the european
traveling circus
is that right
hence i have big ideas
when it comes to presentation
hm
i need something more
than just a big nigger
yeah he needs to have panache
need to have what what
panache uh
a sense of showmanship
showmanship yes
i want to be able to bill him
as the black hercules
all chuckling
the black hercules
isnt that clever
more like niggerles
laughing
i said and i quote
i would pay top dollar for
the right nigger
now im not saying that eskimo
joe is the wrong nigger per se
but is he right as rain
oh dr schultz
i will have you know there is
no one in the nigger fight game
that appreciates
the value of showmanship
more than monsieur
calvin j candie here
nobody
but one must not forget
the most important thing
in the nigger fight game
hmmm
and that is a nigger
that can win fights
hmmm
now that should be your first
second third fourth and fifth
concern
now after you have that
and you know you have that
then you can start
to implement a grand design
in other words
first thing is first
first things first
whispers in german
ooh i see you two gettin on
famously
oh monsieur candie you cant
imagine what its like
not to hear your
native tongue in four years
well hell i cant imagine
two weeks in boston
laughing
two weeks in boston
monsieur candie you a mess
coughing
stephen two weeks in boston
i cant express the joy i felt
conversing in my mother tongue
and hildi is a charming
conversation companion
calvin well be careful now
dr schultz
you mighta caught yourself
a little dose of nigger love
hm
calvin nigger loves
a powerful emotion boy
stephen hm
its like a pool of black tar
once it catches your ass
youre caught
yessir you stuck laughs
lara lee i dont know doctor
you can lay on all the
german sweet talk you want
but it looks like this ponys
got big eyes for django
lara lee giggles
well naturally
it is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention
not the plucked chicken
all chuckle
calvin dr schultz
dont be so down on yourself
you are quite the dapper
european gentleman
cora
you got to clean these dishes
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes you hear me
you know that nigger dont you
who
who
dont who me bitch
you know who im talkin about
at the table
i dont know him
you dont know him
no
no what
no sir
chuckles
you wouldnt lie to me now
would you
ok
yeah if you say so
eskimo joes a quality nigger
no doubt about it
but if it was my money i
wouldnt pay no 12000 for him
what would your price be
well if i was inclined
to be generous
and i dont know why i would
be inclined to be generous
9000 maybe
dr schultz let me reclarify
how this whole
negotiation came about
you see it wasnt me who
came to you to sell a nigger
sure wasnt
it was you who
approached me to buy one
sure was
now that 9000 figure
bright boys been bandyin
about that aint too far off
from right
and if i wanted to sell
eskimo joe for that
i could do so any day
of the week
any day
but like you said in
greenville doctor
i dont want to sell him
it was only your ridiculous
offer of 12000
that made me even consider it
hmmm
deep inhale
you know monsieur candie
you do possess the power of
persuasion
chuckles
slamming table why not
monsieur candie you have
a deal
eskimo joe 12000
banging table hooray
doctor hooray
and a wise decision that is
however that is
a tremendous amount of money
and the way you have
your mr moguy i have a lawyer
persnickety man named tuttle
and i would need my mr tuttle
to draw up a legal contract
before id feel comfortable
exchanging that amount of money
for flesh
hmmm
not to mention having
eskimo joe examined
by a physician of my choosing
calvin naturally
so say i return in about
five days time
five days
with my mr tuttle
and then my mr tuttle
and your mr moguy
can hash out the finer
details between themselves
i say splendid doctor
splendid
gentlemen
may i propose a toast
to eskimo joe or shall
we call him the black hercules
all chuckling
to the black hercules
stephen the black hercules
speaks low
to the black hercules
you was right doctor
that name do have panass
chuckles
hm
hildi top my drink off
so hildi how you like servin
at the big table in the big
house huh
when monsieur candie
talk to you you answers
i like it a lot
monsieur candie
hmmm
its a lot better than sizzlin
in that hot box or draggin your
ass through a bramble bush
but maybe its not quite as much
fun as gettin to pleasure all
them mandingos
huh sugar bear
oh lord she like them
niggers
sure do
like samson huh
hildi no sir
you know monsieur candie
the doctor here might
be interested in seein
hildis peeled back
seein as how they dont have
many niggers where he come from
dr schultz when you
was alone with hildi here
did you just speak german or did
you get to take her clothes off

lara lee uh calvin

and lookin nice
calvin but lara lee
dr schultz is from dusseldorf

dr schultz no doubt about it
hildis got somethin
like four lashes on her back
lara lee just get one
shed lose her goddamn mind
stephen sure would
calvin look at that doctor

chuckles
those lying
goddamn timewastin
sons of bitches
sons of bitches
lara lee
out of new orleans
so i have quite a bit of
practice with theater types
oh there you are
i was beginning to think that
you and that old crow run off
together
all chuckling
thatd be a hell of a note
wouldnt it
lara lee i was just
looking out the big window
billy crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver
trying to sell
a passel of ponies
would you be a dear
go out there
and give them gals
an eyeball hm
of course brother
thank you darling
yeah business never sleeps
hmmm
apropos before your exit
we were discussing the
possibility of my purchasing
broomhilda
ah yes yes we were doctor
and we will again in a moment
whos your little friend
clearing throat
this is ben
hes a old joe that lived
around here for a long time
and i do mean a long damn time
old ben here
took care of my daddy
and my daddys daddy
till he up and
keeled over one day
old ben took care of me
growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in mississippi
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces
i spent my whole life here
right here in candyland
surrounded by black faces
now seeing them every day
day in day out
i only had one question
why dont they kill us
laughs
now right out there on that
porch three times a week
for 50 years
old ben here would shave my
daddy with a straight razor
now if i was old ben i woulda
cut my daddys goddamn throat
and it wouldnt have taken me
no 50 years to do it neither
but he never did
why not
you see the science
of phrenology
is crucial to understanding the
separation of our two species
in the skull
of the african here
the area associated
with submissiveness
is larger than any human or any
other subhuman species on planet
earth
sawing
if you examine
this piece of skull here
you will notice
three distinct dimples
here here and here
now
if i was holding the skull
of an isaac newton or galileo
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull
most associated with
creativity
but this is the skull
of old ben
and in the skull of old ben
unburdened by genius
these three dimples exist
in the area of the skull
most associated with
servility
now bright boy
i will admit
you are pretty clever
but if i took
this hammer here
and i bashed in
your skull with it
you would have the same three
dimples in the same place
as old ben
hey now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop
if you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop
mr pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that
sawedoff
there have been a lot of lies
said around this dinner table
here tonight
but that you can believe
mr moguy would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol
hanging off these
boys hips here
thank you ever so much
doctor
where were we
jackass
ah yes
i do believe you were
just getting ready to make me
a proposition to buy broomhilda
am i right
right
bring out hildi
get over there yonder
screams
sit your ass in
that goddamn
stephen lay your hand flat
on that tabletop
calvin now shut your mouth
dr schultz in greenville
you yourself said that
for the right nigger
youd be willin to pay
what some may consider
is a ridiculous amount
to which me myself said
what is your definition
of ridiculous
to which you said 12000
yells
now considering yall have
ridden a whole lot of miles
went through a whole lot of
trouble and done spread a
whole lot of bull
to purchase this
lovely lady right here
it would appear that
broomhilda is in fact
the right nigger
and if yall want to leave
candyland with broomhilda
the price is 12000
and i take it you prefer the
take it or leave it style
of negotiation
yes i do doctor
you see under the laws
of chickasaw county
broomhilda here is my property
and i can choose to do with my
property whatever i so desire
and if yall think my price
for this nigger here
is too steep
grunts
what im gonna
desire to do is
take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with
it
right in front of both yall
easy big fella
then we can examine the three
dimples inside broomhildas
skull
now whats it gonna be doc
huh
hildi whimpering
whats it gonna be
may i lift the hands
off the tabletop
in order to remove
my billfold
yes you may
that 12
sold
screaming
to the man with
the exceptional beard
and his unexceptional nigger
mr moguy
yes calvin
will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for 12000 please
it was a pleasure doing
business with yall
now gentlemen
if you care to
join me in the parlor
we will be
serving white cake
beethovens fur elise
played on harp
screaming
dogs snarling
screaming
well done calvin

stop playing beethoven
take your hands off
the harp

calvin chuckles softly
you brooding about me
getting the best of you huh
actually i was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs
today
dartagnan
and i was wondering what
dumas would make of all this
come again
alexandre dumas
he wrote the three musketeers
yes of course doctor
i figured you
must be an admirer
you named your slave after
his novels lead character
now if alexandre dumas
had been there today
i wonder what
he would have made of it
you doubt hed approve huh
yes his approval would be
a dubious proposition at best
softhearted frenchie
alexandre dumas is black
are these broomhildas papers
yes they are
may i
of course
thank you
that is her bill of sale
her ownership history
and of course
her freedom papers doctor

ink and pen for me
right over there
on that little table
thank you
thank you
broomhilda von shaft
consider yourself
a free woman
mr candie

actually means is till i see
you again
and since i never
wish to see you again
to you sir
i say goodbye
lets go
come on
one more moment doctor
what
its a custom here
in the south
once a business deal is
concluded that the two parties
shake hands
it implies good faith
im not from the south
but you are
in my house doctor
so im afraid i must insist
insist
on what
that i shake your hand
oh then im afraid i must
insist in the opposite
direction
you know what i think you are
what you think i am
no i dont
i think you are a bad loser
and i think youre an abysmal
winner
nevertheless here in chickasaw
county a deal aint done
until the two parties
have shook hands
even after all that paper
signin dont mean shit
you dont shake my hand
if i dont shake your hand
youre gonna throw away 12000
i dont think so
mr pooch
if she tries to leave here
before this niggerloving german
shakes my hand
you cut her ass down
cocking shotgun
you really want me
to shake your hand
i insist
