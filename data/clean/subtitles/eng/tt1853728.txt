 horse whinnying 
 man screaming

 screaming continues 
i m sorry to put a bullet

caterwauling down to a minimum

 nickering 
whoa 
now  as to you poor devils 
so  as i see it  when it comes
to the subject of what to do
next 
you gentlemen have two choices 
one  once i m gone  you could
lift that beast off the
remaining speck 
then carry him
to the nearest town 
which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came 
or two  you could unshackle
yourselves  take that rifle 
put a bullet in his head 
bury the two of them deep 
and then make your way to
a more enlightened area
of this country 
choice is yours 
oh  and on the off chance
there are any astronomy
aficionados amongst you 
the north star is that one 
ta ta   clucking 
now wait a minute  fellas 
let s talk about this 
   lantern crashing 
   chains rattling 
you gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this 
i m not a bad guy 
i m just doin  my job 
blueberry  didn t i
give you my last apple 
tell you what  boys 
take me to the doc in el paso 
  i ll get you your freedom 
   gun cocking 
  no  no  please   
   gunshot echoing 
 dogs barking nearby 
 squeaking 
all right  now 
i d like you to
take two of these tonight   
   coughing 
     and then in the morning   
that s a nigger on a horse 
what s everybody staring at 
they ain t never seen
no nigger on a horse before 
 goats bleating 
whoa 
good morning  innkeeper 
two beers for
two weary travelers 
it s still a bit early 
we won t be open
for another hour 
by then  we ll be
servin  breakfast 
 gasping  whoa  whoa  whoa 
whoa    what the hell you think
you re doing  boy 
get that nigger outta here 
   panting  help  help 
  innkeeper 
remember  get the sheriff 
not the marshal 
 man  sheriff  help 
alas 
now we must act
as our own bartender 
sit down  my boy 
  what kind of dentist are you 
   chortles 
despite that cart  i haven t
practiced dentistry in five
years 
but these days 
i practice a new profession   
bounty hunter 
do you know what
a bounty hunter is 
no 
well   
the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash 
a bounty hunter
deals in corpses 
 tsking  hat 
prost 
the state places
a bounty on a man s head 
i track that man  i find
that man  i kill that man 
after i ve killed him 
i transport that man s corpse
back to the authorities 
sometimes that s
easier said than done 
i show that corpse to the
authorities  proving yes 
indeed 
i truly have killed him 
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty 
so  like slavery 
it s a flesh for cash business 
what s a bounty 
it s like a reward 
you kill people 
and they give you a reward 
certain people  yeah 
bad people 
ah  badder they are 
bigger the reward 
which brings me to you 
and i must admit  i m at a bit
of a quandary when it comes to
you 
on one hand  i despise slavery 
on the other hand 
i need your help 
if you re not in a position
to refuse  all the better 
so  for the time being  i m
gonna make this slavery malarkey
work to my benefit 
still  having said that 
i feel guilty 
so  i would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement 
i m looking for
the brittle brothers 
however  at this endeavor 
i m at a slight disadvantage
insofar as i don t know
what they look like 
but you do  don t ya 
i know what they
look like all right 
good  so here s my agreement 
  you travel with me
until we find them 
  where we goin  
i hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in gatlinburg 
but i don t know where 
that means we visit every
plantation in gatlinburg
till we find  em 
and when we find them  you point
them out  and i kill them 
you do that  i agree
to give you your freedom 
 25 per brittle brother 
that s  75 
and  as if on cue 
here comes the sheriff 
 scoffs 
ok  boys  fun s over 
come on out 
   overlapping chatter 
  all right  folks  calm down 
go about your business 
these jokers will be gone soon 
now  why y all wanna come
into my town and start trouble

nothing better to do

of the criminal justice system
of the united states of america 
i shan t be shot down in the
street by either you or your
deputies
before i ve had my day in court 
you mean like
you did our sheriff 
shot him down
like a dog in the street 
yes  that s exactly what i mean

like yourself  marshal 
i m a servant of the court 
the man lying dead in the dirt 
who the good people of daughtrey
saw fit to elect as their
sheriff  who went by the
name of bill sharp 
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of willard peck 
with a price
on his head of  200 
now that s  200  dead or alive 
the hell  you say 
i m aware this is probably
disconcerting news 
but i m willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff
sometime in the past two years 
yeah 
 schultz  i know this
because three years ago 
he was rustling cattle from the
b c  corrigan cattle company of
lubbock  texas 
now  this is a
warrant made out by 
circuit court judge henry allen
laudermilk of austin  texas 
you re encouraged to wire him

you know them by the name of
shaffer  but the butchers  real
name was brittle 
these are wanted men 
the law wants  em for murder

states dead or alive 
so when mr  freeman and myself
executed these men on sight 
we were operating
within our legal boundaries 
i realize passions are high 
but i must warn you  the penalty
for taking deadly force
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty
is you ll be hung by the neck
until you re dead

warrant from my pocket so you
may examine it

how you know broomhilda s
first masters was german 
broomhilda is a german name 
if they named her  it stands
to reason they d be german 
lots of gals where
you re from named broomhilda 
broomhilda is the name
of a character
in the most popular
of all the german legends 
there s a story
about broomhilda 
oh  yes  there is 
  do you know it 
  oh  every german knows
that story 
would you like me to tell you 
well  broomhilda was a princess 
she was a daughter of wotan 
god of all gods 
anyway  her father
is really mad at her 
what she do 
i can t exactly remember 
she disobeys him in some way 
so he puts her
on top of the mountain 
broomhilda s on a mountain 
it s a german legend 
there s always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere 
and he puts a fire breathing
dragon there to guard the
mountain 
and he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire 
and there 
broomhilda shall remain 
unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her 
does a fella arise 
yes  django 
as a matter of fact  he does 
a fella named siegfried 
does siegfried save her 
quite spectacularly so 
he scales the mountain 
because he s not afraid of it 
he slays the dragon 
because he s not afraid of him 
and he walks through hellfire   
because broomhilda s
worth it 
i know how he feel 
i think i m just
starting to realize that 
now  look  django   
i don t doubt that one day
you ll save your lady love   
but i can t let you go to
greenville in a good conscience 
a slave auction town in
mississippi isn t the place
for you to visit 
free or not 
it s just too dangerous 
but let me ask you a question 
how do you like the
bounty hunting business 
kill white folks
and they pay you for it 
what s not to like 
now  i have to admit 
we make a good team 
i thought you was mad at me for
killin  big john and lil raj 
yeah  on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous 
but normally 
that s a good thing 
how d you like to
partner up for the winter 
what you mean  partner up  
you work with me through the
winter till the snow melts   
i give you
a third of my bounties 
so we make some money this
winter  and when the snow melts 
i ll take you
to greenville myself
and we ll find
where they sent your wife 
why you care what happen to me 
why you care if i find my wife 
frankly   
i ve never given anybody
their freedom before 
and now that i have  i feel
vaguely responsible for you 
plus  when a german meets a real
life siegfried  that s kind of a
big deal 
as a german  i m obliged
to help you on your quest
to rescue your
beloved broomhilda

 broomhilda von shaft  age 27 
 r  on right cheek  
calvin candie 
he owns the fourth biggest
cotton plantation in
mississippi  candyland 
candyland 
oh  so you ve heard of it 
ain t no slave ain t
heard of candyland 
well  apparently 
that s where your wife is 
  and that s the repellant
gentleman who owns her 
   sighs 
let s just hope she works
in the house  not in the field 
oh  no  she ain t
no field nigger 
she    she pretty 
and she talk good  too 
but when they tore
her back up and then they   
burned that runaway  r 
on her cheek   
they goddamned her 
 yells 
   sizzling 
   screaming 
she ain t no field nigger
but she ain t good enough
for the house no more either 
they gonna try to
make her a comfort girl 
what s a comfort     oh 
not while i got freedom 
not while i got my gun 
so do we offer to buy her 
so   
say   
a man wants to buy a horse 
needs to buy a horse 
he walks up to the farmer s
farm  and he knocks on the
farmer s door
and asks the farmer
to buy his horse 
and do you know
what the farmer says 
the farmer says no 
well  i say fuck that farmer 
and i m stealin  that horse 
fair enough  but now you re
a horse thief  and they hang
horse thieves 
not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner
because the horse
is still his property 
we need her
and we need a bill of sale 
well  if we ain t gonna try to
buy her  then how we gonna get
her 
may i offer an
alternative plan of action 
go ahead 
so    the man walks up
to the farmer s farm 
he knocks on
the farmer s door   
and asks not to buy
the horse  but the farm 
and makes an offer
so ridiculous 
the farmer is forced to say yes 
we gonna offer
to buy candyland 
no  it s far too big 
but apparently this farmer
ain t all about the farm 
  how much do you know

indeed 
may we stop for a moment so i
may put a word in my man s ear 
you know  i m expecting to fall
in love once i see the specimens

a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant 
you mind telling me
what the hell you doing 
i confirmed that
broomhilda s at candyland 
  you re sure it s her 
  he didn t call her by name 
but she s a young lady 
whip marks on her back
and speaks german 
now  while it s
not wise to assume 
in this instance 
i think it s pretty safe 
point being  don t get
so carried away with your
retribution 
you lose sight
of why we re here 
  you think i lost
sight of that 
  yes  i do 
stop antagonizing candie 
you re going to blow this whole
charade  or more than likely get
us both killed 
and i  for one  don t intend
to die in chickasaw county 
mississippi  usa 
i m not antagonizing him 
i m intriguing him 
you re yelling abuse
at these poor slaves 
i recall the man who had me kill
another man in front of his son
and he didn t bat a eye 
you remember that

what you said was that
this is my world   
and in my world
you gotta get dirty 
so that s what i m doing 
i m gettin  dirty

   chuckles

justified

out the way 
  you know you like it 
   laughs  that s  cause
you knows what i like 
  ooh 
come on with these biscuits 
girl 
look  monsieur candie  they were
all fine specimens  no doubt
about it 
but the best three by far
were samson   
  what s that other one s name 
  goldie 
goldie  and eskimo joe 
by the way  why is
he called eskimo joe 
 chuckles  you never know how
these nigger nicknames get
started 
his name was joe  maybe one day
he said he was cold  who knows 
 all laugh 
well  regardless  samson s
your best  we all know that 
  you will never sell him  and
i can see why  he s a champion 
  hm hm 
all three are champions 
samson s the champion 
them other two pretty good 
calvin  now what s
this nigger you let   
it s all right  it s all right 
you have to understand 
monsieur candie 
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game 
i do have a little bit of a
background in the european
traveling circus 
  is that right 
  hence  i have big ideas
when it comes to presentation 
  hm 
  i need something more
than just a big nigger 
yeah  he needs to have panache 
  need to have what  what 
  panache  uh   
  a sense of showmanship 
  showmanship  yes 
i want to be able to bill him
as the black hercules 
 all chuckling 
  the black hercules 
isn t that clever 
  more like nigger les 
 laughing 
i said  and i quote 
 i would pay top dollar for   
 the right nigger    
now i m not saying that eskimo
joe is the wrong nigger  per se 
but is he right as rain 
oh  dr  schultz 
i will have you know there is
no one in the nigger fight game
that appreciates
the value of showmanship
  more than monsieur
calvin j  candie here 
  nobody 
but one must not forget
the most important thing
  in the nigger fight game 
  hm mm 
  and that is a nigger
that can win fights 
  hm mm 
now that should be your first 
second  third  fourth  and fifth
concern 
now  after you have that 
and you know you have that 
then you can start
to implement a grand design 
in other words 
first thing is first 
first thing s first 
 whispers in german 
ooh  i see you two gettin  on 
famously 
oh  monsieur candie  you can t
imagine what it s like
not to hear your
native tongue in four years 
well  hell  i can t imagine
two weeks in boston 
 laughing 
  two weeks in boston 
monsieur candie  you a mess 
   coughing 
 stephen  two weeks in boston 
i can t express the joy i felt
conversing in my mother tongue 
and hildi is a charming
conversation companion 
 calvin  well  be careful now 
dr  schultz 
  you might a caught yourself
a little dose of nigger love 
  hm 
   calvin  nigger love s
a powerful emotion  boy 
   stephen  hm 
it s like a pool of black tar 
once it catches your ass 
you re caught 
yessir  you stuck   laughs 
 lara lee  i don t know  doctor 
you can lay on all the
german sweet talk you want 
but it looks like this pony s
got big eyes for django 
 lara lee giggles 
well  naturally 
it is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention 
  not the plucked chicken 
   all chuckle 
 calvin  dr  schultz 
don t be so down on yourself 
you are quite the dapper
european gentleman 
 cora 
you got to clean these dishes 
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes  you hear me 
you know that nigger  don t you 
  who 
   who  
don t  who  me  bitch 
you know who i m talkin  about 
at the table 
i don t know him 
  you don t know him 
  no 
   no   what 
  no  sir 
 chuckles 
you wouldn t lie to me  now 
would you 
ok 
yeah  if you say so 
eskimo joe s a quality nigger 
no doubt about it 
but if it was my money  i
wouldn t pay no  12 000 for him 
what would your price be 
well  if i was inclined
to be generous   
and i don t know why i would
be inclined to be generous   
9 000  maybe 
dr  schultz  let me reclarify
how this whole
negotiation came about 
you see  it wasn t me who
came to you to sell a nigger 
  sure wasn t 
  it was you who
approached me to buy one 
  sure was 
  now  that  9 000 figure 
bright boy s been bandyin 
about  that ain t too far off
from right 
and if i wanted to sell
eskimo joe for that 
  i could do so any day
of the week 
  any day 
but  like you said in
greenville  doctor   
i don t want to sell him 
it was only your ridiculous
offer of  12 000
  that made me even consider it 
  hm mm 
 deep inhale 
you know  monsieur candie 
you do possess the power of
persuasion 
 chuckles 
 slamming table  why not 
monsieur candie  you have
a deal 
  eskimo joe   12 000 
   banging table  hooray 
doctor  hooray 
and a wise decision that is 
however  that is
a tremendous amount of money 
and the way you have
your mr  moguy  i have a lawyer 
persnickety man named tuttle 
and i would need my mr  tuttle
to draw up a legal contract
before i d feel comfortable
exchanging that amount of money
for flesh 
  hm mm 
  not to mention having
eskimo joe examined
  by a physician of my choosing 
   calvin  naturally 
so  say i return in about   
     five days time 
  five days 
with my mr  tuttle 
and then my mr  tuttle
and your mr  moguy
can hash out the finer
details between themselves 
i say splendid  doctor 
splendid 
gentlemen   
may i propose a toast 
to eskimo joe  or shall
we call him the black hercules 
   all chuckling 
  to the black hercules 
 stephen  the black hercules 
 speaks low 
to the black hercules 
you was right  doctor 
that name do have pan ass 
 chuckles 
hm 
hildi  top my drink off 
so  hildi  how you like servin 
at the big table in the big
house  huh 
when monsieur candie
talk to you  you answers 
  i like it a lot 
monsieur candie 
  hm mm 
it s a lot better than sizzlin 
in that hot box or draggin  your
ass through a bramble bush 
but maybe it s not quite as much
fun as gettin  to pleasure all
them mandingos 
  huh  sugar bear 
  oh  lord  she like them
niggers 
  sure do 
  like samson  huh 
   hildi  no  sir 
  you know  monsieur candie

be interested in seein 
hildi s peeled back 
seein  as how they don t have
many niggers where he come from 
dr  schultz  when you
was alone with hildi  here 
did you just speak german or did

 calvin  but  lara lee 
dr  schultz is from dusseldorf

the niggers  endurance for pain 
these niggers are tough 
dr  schultz  no doubt about it 
hildi s got somethin 
like four lashes on her back 
lara lee just get one

 chuckles 
those lying   
goddamn time wastin 
sons of bitches 
sons of bitches 
 lara lee 
   out of new orleans 
so i have quite a bit of
practice with theater types 
oh  there you are 
i was beginning to think that
you and that old crow run off
together 
 all chuckling 
that d be a hell of a note 
wouldn t it 
lara lee  i was just
looking out the big window 
billy crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver
trying to sell
a passel of ponies 
would you be a dear 
go out there
and give them gals
an eyeball  hm 
  of course  brother 
  thank you  darling 
  yeah  business never sleeps 
  hm mm 
apropos  before your exit 
we were discussing the
possibility of my purchasing
broomhilda 
ah  yes  yes  we were  doctor 
and we will again  in a moment 
who s your little friend 
 clearing throat 
this is ben 
he s a old joe that lived
around here for a long time 
and i do mean a long damn time 
old ben here
took care of my daddy   
and my daddy s daddy 
till he up and
keeled over one day   
old ben took care of me 
growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in mississippi
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces 
i spent my whole life here 
right here in candyland   
surrounded by black faces 
now  seeing them every day 
day in  day out 
i only had one question 
  why don t they kill us 
   laughs 
now  right out there on that
porch  three times a week
for 50 years 
old ben here would shave my
daddy with a straight razor 
now  if i was old ben  i woulda
cut my daddy s goddamn throat
and it wouldn t have taken me
no 50 years to do it  neither 
but he never did 
why not 
you see  the science
of phrenology
is crucial to understanding the
separation of our two species 
in the skull
of the african here 
the area associated
with submissiveness
is larger than any human or any
other subhuman species on planet
earth 
 sawing 
if you examine   
this piece of skull here   
you will notice
three distinct dimples 
here  here and here 
now   
if i was holding the skull
of an isaac newton or galileo 
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull
most associated with   
creativity 
but this is the skull
of old ben 
and in the skull of old ben 
unburdened by genius 
these three dimples exist
in the area of the skull
most associated with   
servility 
now  bright boy   
i will admit
you are pretty clever 
but if i took
this hammer here   
and i bashed in
your skull with it   
you would have the same three
dimples in the same place   
as old ben 
hey  now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop 
if you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop 
mr  pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that
sawed off 
there have been a lot of lies
said around this dinner table
here tonight 
but that you can believe 
mr  moguy  would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol
hanging off these
boys  hips here 
  thank you ever so much 
  doctor 
where were we 
jackass 
ah  yes 
i do believe you were
just getting ready to make me
a proposition to buy broomhilda 
am i right 
right 
bring out hildi 
get over there yonder 
   screams 
  sit your ass in
that goddamn   
   stephen  lay your hand flat
on that tabletop 
   calvin  now shut your mouth 
dr  schultz  in greenville 
 you yourself said that
for the right nigger 
you d be willin  to pay
what some may consider
is a ridiculous amount 
to which me myself said 
 what is your definition
of ridiculous  
to which you said    12 000  
   yells 
  now  considering y all have
ridden a whole lot of miles 
went through a whole lot of
trouble  and done spread a
whole lot of bull
to purchase this
lovely lady right here 
it would appear that
broomhilda is  in fact   
the right nigger 
and if y all want to leave
candyland with broomhilda 
the price is  12 000 
and i take it you prefer the
 take it or leave it  style
of negotiation 
yes  i do  doctor 
you see  under the laws
of chickasaw county 
broomhilda here is my property 
and i can choose to do with my
property whatever i so desire 
and if y all think my price   
     for this nigger here
is too steep   
   grunts 
what i m gonna
desire to do is   
take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with
it 
  right in front of both y all 
  easy  big fella 
then we can examine the three
dimples inside broomhilda s
skull 
now  what s it gonna be  doc 
huh 
   hildi whimpering 
  what s it gonna be 
may i lift the hands
off the tabletop
in order to remove
my billfold 
yes  you may 
that 12 
  sold 
   screaming 
to the man with
the exceptional beard
and his unexceptional nigger 
  mr  moguy 
  yes  calvin 
will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for  12 000  please 
 12 000 
it was a pleasure doing
business with y all 
now  gentlemen   
if you care to
join me in the parlor   
we will be
serving white cake 
 beethoven s  fur elise 
played on harp 
   screaming 
   dogs snarling 
 screaming 
well done  calvin 
excuse me 
excuse me  ma am 
could you please
stop playing beethoven 
take your hands off
the harp 
 stephen  doctor 
  doctor  you can t go in there 
  stephen  stephen 
he ain t got no business
going in there 
let it be 
he s just a little upset 
that s all 
i ll handle this 
white cake 
i don t go in for sweets 
thank you 
hm 
 calvin chuckles softly 
you brooding about me
getting the best of you  huh 
actually  i was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs
today 
d artagnan 
and i was wondering what
dumas would make of all this 
come again 
alexandre dumas 
he wrote the three musketeers 
yes  of course  doctor 
i figured you
must be an admirer 
you named your slave after
his novel s lead character 
now  if alexandre dumas
had been there today 
i wonder what
he would have made of it 
you doubt he d approve  huh 
yes  his approval would be
a dubious proposition at best 
soft hearted frenchie 
alexandre dumas is black 
  are these broomhilda s papers 
  yes  they are 
  may i 
  of course 
thank you 
that is her bill of sale 
her ownership history 
and  of course 
her freedom papers  doctor 
would you have
ink and pen for me 
right over there
on that little table 
thank you 
thank you 
broomhilda von shaft   
consider yourself
a free woman 
mr  candie   
normally 
i would say auf wiedersehen 
but since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is  till i see
you again 
and since i never
wish to see you again 
to you  sir   
i say   goodbye  
let s go 
come on 
one more moment  doctor 
what 
it s a custom here
in the south   
once a business deal is
concluded that the two parties
shake hands 
it implies good faith 
  i m not from the south 
  but you are   
in my house  doctor 
  so i m afraid i must insist 
  insist 
on what 
that i shake your hand 
oh  then i m afraid i must
insist in the opposite
direction 
  you know what i think you are 
  what you think i am 
no  i don t 
  i think you are a bad loser 
  and i think you re an abysmal
winner 
nevertheless  here in chickasaw
county  a deal ain t done
until the two parties
have shook hands 
even after all that paper
signin   don t mean shit   
you don t shake my hand 
if i don t shake your hand 
you re gonna throw away  12 000 
i don t think so 
mr  pooch 
if she tries to leave here
before this nigger loving german
shakes my hand 
you cut her ass down 
 cocking shotgun 
you really want me
to shake your hand 
i insist 
if you insist 
 metal springing noise 
no  calvin 
calvin 
 slow heartbeat rhythm 
i m sorry  i couldn t resist 
 sobbing 
nigger s gone crazy  help 
   screaming 
  help  he s killing everyone 
   gunshot 
   screaming 
ah   screams 
 grunting 
 screaming 
holy    
shit  son of a bitch 
 overlapping gunfire 
 man  damn it  fuckin
