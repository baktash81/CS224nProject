             i m next           
        okay  go on             
             it s wired         
         the detonator is set   
             you better hurry   
         or you just might      
             blow it            
                i understand how
         it must sound  general 
            but i can assure you
         it s absolutely true   
i don t know                    
people being sucked             
under the sand                  
a lot of aliens                 
running around loose            
underneath the town             
it s a little hard              
to swallow                      
                 excuse me  sir 
             nasa does confirm  
             a visual sighting  
                         a ufo  
     2 nights ago during        
     the meteor shower          
         but radar              
     reported no strike         
 in fact  radar reported        
         nothing at all         
general                         
what if the ship                
absorbed energy                 
it wouldn t                     
show up on radar                
because no energy               
would bounce back  right        
         search teams were sent 
             out to find signs  
         of impact or landing   
                            sir 
             the men who checked
            the copper hill area

     doctor  i didn t think     
         the viking missions    
         found any sign of life 
         except for this photo  
         i saw in a magazine    
             of these things    
             on the surface     
             that looked        
             like pyramids      
                     i saw that 
                     photograph 
         and what about         
         that huge thing        
     that kind of looked        
     like a monkey s head       
     it was in all the papers   
        that was fake  right    
            on the contrary     
         there were other photos
             too sensational    
         to be made public      
but there s not enough water    
 to support life                
on the surface                  
we re looking below ground      
        if there is             
         david                  
     it may not want            
        to be found

and you started                 
chasing me down the hill        
 then everything exploded       
 into a great big white light   
that is                         
really weird  david             
                     actually   
                i like the stuff
     about the martians         
         coming to steal        
             the copper         
     but it seemed              
     so real                    
                     copper for 
                 energy  huh

to worry about                  
your penny collection           
is still here                   
you know what it seems to me    
 it seems to me like            
             your dream was full
         of all sorts of things 
                 that happened  
             to you today  like 
         your penny collection  
         even  mad dog  wilson  
         coming to your school  
                 but i was      
                 so scared      
there s nothing                 
to be afraid of
