of a small boy named mowgli 
it all began when the silence
of the jungle was broken by
an unfamiliar sound 
it was a sound like one never heard
before in this part of the jungle 
it was a man cub 
had i known how deeply
i was to be involved   
i would ve obeyed my
first impulse and walked away 
this man cub would have to
have nourishment  and soon 
it was many days travel
to the nearest man village   
and without a mother s care 
he would soon perish 
then it occurred to me 
a family of wolves i knew
had been blessed with a litter of cubs 
oh  i knew there d be no problem
with the mother thanks to
the maternal instinct  but   
i wasn t so sure
about rama  the father 
ten times the rains
had come and gone 
and i often stopped by to see how mowgli
the man cub was getting along 
he was a favourite of all
the young wolf cubs of the pack 
no man cub was
ever happier 
and yet  i knew
that someday   
he would have to go back
to his own kind 
then one night  the wolf pack
elders met at council rock   
because shere khan
the tiger   
had returned to
their part of the jungle 
this meeting was to change
the man cub s entire future 
shere khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him 
now  are we all in agreement
as to what must be done 
now it is my unpleasant duty
to tell the boy s father 
rama  uh  come
over here  please 
  yes  akela 
  the council has reached its decision 
the man cub can no longer
stay with the pack 
  he must leave at once 
  leave 
i m  sorry  rama 
there is no other way 
but  but the man cub is 
well  he s like my own son 
surely he s entitled to
the protection of the pack 
but  rama  even the strength of the pack
is no match for the tiger 
but the boy cannot survive
alone in the jungle 
akela  perhaps
i can be of help 
you  bagheera  how 
i know of a man village
where he ll be safe 
mowgli and i have taken many
walks into the jungle together 
so i m  sure he ll go with me 
so be it  now there s
no time to lose  good luck 
bagheera 
i m  getting a little sleepy 
shouldn t we start back home 
mowgli  this time
we re not going back 
  i m  taking you to a man village 
  but why 
because shere khan has returned
to this part of the jungle 
and he has sworn
to kill you 
kill me  but why would he
wanna do that 
he hates man 
and shere khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man 
just another hunter
with a gun 
aw  we ll just explain to him that
i d never do a thing like that 
nonsense  no one explains
anything to shere khan 
well  maybe so 
but i m  not afraid 
  and besides  i 
  now that s enough 
we ll spend the night here 
things will look better in the morning 
man cub  man cub 
now come on  up this tree 
be safer up there 
i don t wanna go back
to the man village 
go on  up you go 
  that limb way up there 
  that s right 
is that all the better
you can climb 
i  oh  it s
too big around 
and besides  i don t
have any claws 
now  get some sleep 
we ve got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow 
i  i wanna stay
in the jungle 
huh  you wouldn t
last one day 
i m  not afraid  i i can
look out for myself 
say now  what have we here 
it s a man cub 
a delicious man cub 
oh  go away and
leave me alone 
oh  that s just what i
should do  but i m  not 
now  now  please go
to sleep  man cub 
yes  man cub 
please go to sleep 
please go to sleep
sleep  little man cub
rest in peace
