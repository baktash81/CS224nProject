of a small boy named mowgli
it all began when the silence
of the jungle was broken by
an unfamiliar sound
it was a sound like one never heard
before in this part of the jungle
it was a man cub
had i known how deeply
i was to be involved
i wouldve obeyed my
first impulse and walked away
this man cub would have to
have nourishment and soon
it was many days travel
to the nearest man village
and without a mothers care
he would soon perish
then it occurred to me
a family of wolves i knew
had been blessed with a litter of cubs
oh i knew thered be no problem
with the mother thanks to
the maternal instinct but
i wasnt so sure
about rama the father
ten times the rains
had come and gone
and i often stopped by to see how mowgli
the man cub was getting along
he was a favourite of all
the young wolf cubs of the pack
no man cub was
ever happier
and yet i knew
that someday
he would have to go back
to his own kind
then one night the wolf pack
elders met at council rock
because shere khan
the tiger
had returned to
their part of the jungle
this meeting was to change
the man cubs entire future
shere khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him
now are we all in agreement
as to what must be done
now it is my unpleasant duty
to tell the boys father
rama uh come
over here please
yes akela
the council has reached its decision
the man cub can no longer
stay with the pack
he must leave at once
leave
im  sorry rama
there is no other way
but but the man cub is
well hes like my own son
surely hes entitled to
the protection of the pack
but rama even the strength of the pack
is no match for the tiger
but the boy cannot survive
alone in the jungle
akela perhaps
i can be of help
you bagheera how
i know of a man village
where hell be safe
mowgli and i have taken many
walks into the jungle together
so im  sure hell go with me
so be it now theres
no time to lose good luck
bagheera
im  getting a little sleepy
shouldnt we start back home
mowgli this time
were not going back
im  taking you to a man village
but why
because shere khan has returned
to this part of the jungle
and he has sworn
to kill you
kill me but why would he
wanna do that
he hates man
and shere khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man
just another hunter
with a gun
aw well just explain to him that
id never do a thing like that
nonsense no one explains
anything to shere khan
well maybe so
but im  not afraid
and besides i
now thats enough
well spend the night here
things will look better in the morning
man cub man cub
now come on up this tree
be safer up there
i dont wanna go back
to the man village
go on up you go
that limb way up there
thats right
is that all the better
you can climb
i oh its
too big around
and besides i dont
have any claws
now get some sleep
weve got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow

last one day

look out for myself
