let me down 
bungle in the jungle 
more bad news from the vietnamese set
of tropic thunder 
where a  4 million explosion
charred the asian location
and the camera wasn t even rolling 
financed by hotheaded mega mogul
les grossman 
the film is already rumored to be
one month behind schedule
just five days into shooting 
the reason 
fingers are pointed at rookie director
damien cockburn 
who  insiders say 
can t control a star studded cast 
including flatulent star of the popular
fatties franchise  jeff portnoy 
let me tell you something 
a lot of people are disrespecting me 
they say that the movie s
just about farts  it s about family 
and    you  you can t do what i do 
fresh from his most recent arrest
for heroin  glue and crack possession 
portnoy was almost uninsurable 
also in the mix is booty sweat hocking
hip hop hyphenate alpa chino 
i m so excited  you know what i m
saying  about doing tropic thunder 
hey  drink booty sweat  baby 
drink booty sweat 
but the real heavyweight on the set
is five time academy award winner
kirk lazarus 
the brilliant australian
known for his bad boy antics off screen
is famous for his total immersion
into any role he portrays 
well  being an actor is no different
well  being an actor is no different
than being a rugby player
or a construction worker 
save for the fact that my tools
are the mechanisms
that trigger human emotion 
lazarus underwent a controversial
pigmentation alteration procedure
in order to play
the platoon s african american
sergeant  lincoln osiris 
yeah 
trying to hold his own onscreen
with kirk
is action juggernaut tugg speedman 
once the highest grossing star
in the world 
lately his scorcher films
have lost their heat 
recently  speedman opened up to tyra 
you have no real family 
you re on the wrong side of 40 
you re childless and alone 
somebody close to you said 
 one more flop and it s over  
somebody said they were close to me 
it s been a tough year for tugg 
the disappointing buddy comedy
chitlin    the dude
was followed by an ill advised venture
into serious dramatic territory 
simple jack 
the story of a mentally impaired
farmhand who can talk to animals 
was a box office disaster
that many critics called 
 one of the worst movies of all time  
i ain t got a good brain 
i think you ve got a fine brain  jack 
you make me happy 
but now the question is 
can speedman make audiences happy
in what s being called
the most expensive
  war movie never made 
  rick peck 
wishing tugg all the best on that one 
rum tum tuggernauts  it s the pecker 
you got time for your agent 
  rick 
  hey  buddy 
guess who i m staring at right now 
  what 
  i m looking at your ugly mug
on the back cover
of vanity fair magazine 
holding a cute  cuddly panda
from cutesville 
it is insane  bro  you are a rock star 
hey  did you get the gift basket i sent 
from rick 
yeah  yeah  it s cool  man  thanks 
all right 
that is a real satellite phone  bro 
do not re gift 
hey  you see
that access hollywood piece 
yeah  i did 
it was like pistol whipping a blind kid 
i mean  i m not gonna sugarcoat it 
tugg  you are a huge star  all right 
but right now 
you re like that kid on the playground 
you know 
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with 
  what do you mean 
  i mean we gotta shave your head
and get you back
on the monkey bars  right 
what 
how did the crying scene go 
horrible  lazarus started crying 
then he starts drooling and dribbling 
and it wasn t even in the script   
stop right there 
you gotta buck up here  tuggboat 
who cares how much more talented
he may be than you 
if he cries  you cry harder  man 
didn t your dog have  like  leukemia
or something
when you were a kid 
i mean  think of that 
boom  end of story 
they hook up the tivo yet 
  no 
  what 
they have digital cable  but 
i mean  it s okay 
no  no  no  come on  man  it s not okay 
it is not okay  tugg 
and you don t need to explain to me
why you need tivo
or clean water  clean sheets 
food  shelter 
i mean  i fought for that in your contract 
how s the adoption thing coming 
buddy 
not too great 
well  at least you get to choose yours 
i m stuck with mine 
tell you what  get back to work 
genius soldier 
the pecker s on a tivo mission

i mean  are we in a crisis 
he s the head of the studio 
he s reaching out 
we re 10 000 miles away 
he just wants a little face time 
i know  it s just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting  so   
it s les grossman 
he throws these words around 
 crisis    explosion  
 not rolling    fired  
these are just words 
yeah  yeah 
keep a secret  a camera truck
in london just plowed into judi dench 
trust me  he s got bigger problems 
look  he may be able to see me

hey  les  i understand if you re angry 
but i am dealing
with a bunch of prima donnas 
clowns  tugg speedman  he can t cry 
he can t cry 
you know how you handle an actor 
they whine about anything 
you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass 
  you spank that ass  les 
  what 
spanking a child
turns him into a little snot 
fear makes him a man 
i know a place
where a man s worth is measured
in the ears hanging from his dog tags 
the real deep shit 
you wanna make this movie right 
that s where you take
your pansy ass actors 
who is this guy 
les  that s four leaf 
sergeant four leaf tayback 
i wrote the book 
you re a great american 
this nation owes you a huge debt 
now shut the fuck up
and let me do my job 
  look  cockburn 
  yes 
from now on  my fist
is gonna be so far up your shithole
that every time you have a thought 
it s gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring 
take control of your actors 
or i will shut you down 
diet coke 
when the herd loses its way 
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray 
  four leaf 
  come on over  it s okay 
  sit down 
  yes 
  so  you don t like the hotel 
  beds give me nightmares 
i m guessing right about now
you couldn t find a dixie coonskin
with an ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way 
what 
i put my story in your limp brit hands 
and you are not going to fail me 
you think i was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting 
you must put those boys in the shit 
what  i don t understand 
  you wanna make your movie or not 
  yes  i do 
all right  you get
some of those little video type cameras 
we take them out there  and we put
them in the trees in different angles 
then you give me
and that pyromaniac cody
all the smoke bombs  charges 
explosives  detonators you got 
then we take those boys up there 
me and cody 
we could light up that fucking jungle 
so those lily dick actors
would be shitting their pants
and screaming for their mammies 
they d be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home 
i could do it 
i could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style  gritty  dirty 
get them away from their helpers
and ass licking assistants 
put them in the real shit 
  real shit 
  with real fear in their eyes 
real fear  real emotion 
yes  four leaf  yes 
  yes  yes 
  yes  yes 
take them off the fucking grid 
you are no longer actors in a movie 
you are five men in a helicopter 
with three other men 
how long are we gonna be gone

back at the hotel 
  save your breath  maggots

from unseen vantage points 
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film 
and believe me  gentlemen

chances are it probably is 
you wanted to be actors 
you wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being

of a terrified u s  infantry grunt 
surrounded by death 
crawling up satan s bottom 
there ll be ambushes  enemy fire 
your own little personal slice of  nam

really swung for the fences  huh 
thank you  thanks  yeah 
yeah  it was an intense experience 
you know 
i just did the work 
watched a lot of retarded people 
spent time with them  observed them 
watched all the retarded stuff they did 
then again 
i always found mere observation
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary 
sometimes  we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt 
thus  we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it  you know 
yeah  yeah  live it  yeah  exactly 
you know  there were times
when i was doing jack
that i actually felt retarded 
  like really retarded 
  damn 
  like really retarded 
  damn 
in a weird way 
i had to sort of just free myself up
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb 
  to be a moron 
  yeah 
  to be moronical 
  exactly  to be a moron 
  an imbecile 
  yeah 
like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived 
when i was playing the character 
  when you was the character 
  yeah  as jack  definitely 
jack  stupid ass jack 
by the end of the whole thing  i was like 
 wait a minute  i flushed so much out 
how am i gonna jumpstart it up again  
  it s just like    right 
  yeah 
you was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off 
yeah  i mean  it was really quite a   
it was crazy 
it s like working with mercury 
it s high science  man  it s an art form 
  yeah 
  you an artist 
  that s what we do  right  yeah 
  yeah 
hats off for going there 
especially knowing how
the academy is about that shit

you saw what i saw 
tugg speedman is dead meat
if we don t do something soon 
yeah  we could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel 
which is in the other direction 
ain t right 
what would ve happened
in the great escape
if steve mcqueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran 
well  that s what that movie was about 
they were escaping  they ran away 
i m trying to agree with you 
the point is they did something 
then what are we supposed to do  huh 
 cause he s cleaning a gun
with no bullets  yeah  that s a plan 
i m just like a little boy 
playing with his dick when he s nervous 
wait a minute  wait a minute 
wait a minute 
i got an idea 
this might be a little crazy 
crazy s better than nothing 
back in  98  i did a low budget
titty comedy for skinemax 
  sex camp  remember it 
  yeah 
anyway  me and the campers
from the uncool camp
had to break into the rich girl camp 
so  what we did 
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear 
and they shot us over the wall 
and we parachuted down 
look 
  you guys  we already know the plan 
  fine 
we do it just like in the book 
chapter 26  the wet offensive 
the book of tropic thunder 
yeah  did you guys read the book 
the flap  i read the back flap
and saw the pictures 
well  it s okay 
it s exactly the same as in the script 
cool 
you guys all read the script  right 
i don t read the script  script reads me 
what the hell does that even mean 
what you getting at with the books 
scripts  spit that shit out  man 
all right  the wet offensive 
osiris and fats go undercover
as a diversion 
motown and brooklyn sneak in
via the river 
yeah  but those dudes
was trained soldiers 
yeah 
and we trained actors  motherfucker 
time to man up 
and i ain t gonna sugarcoat 
some of us
might not even make it back

like not on the same flight 
alpa and i s already wearing
earth mama s natural night camo 
  cool it  benson

flaming dragon s
a heroin manufacturer

for an eighth of the drug trade in asia 
  huge profit margin 
  guys

peck  we have it handled 
please  don t interrupt 
everything s under control 
i got it  got it

how about i send you
a hobo s dick cheese 
then you kill him  do your thing 
skin the fucking bastard 
go to town  man  go to town 
  no   
  in the meantime  and as usual 
go fuck yourself

whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
hey  hey  are you insane 
  i think i could ve done that better 
  i thought it was good 
they re gonna kill him 
and we ll weep for him  in the press 
set up a scholarship in his name 
eventually  and i m talking way 
way down the road 
we file an insurance claim 
preferably before
the end of the fiscal year 
actually  the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose 
you can t be serious 
let s face it 
the kids aren t dressing up as scorcher
for purim anymore 
speedman is a dying star 
a white dwarf heading for a black hole 
that s physics  it s inevitable 
we ve been handed
an incredible opportunity here  peck 
the universe is talking to us right now
