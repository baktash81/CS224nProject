oh mama
let me down
bungle in the jungle
more bad news from the vietnamese set
of tropic thunder
where a 4 million explosion
charred the asian location
and the camera wasnt even rolling
financed by hotheaded megamogul
les grossman
the film is already rumored to be
one month behind schedule
just five days into shooting
the reason
fingers are pointed at rookie director
damien cockburn
who insiders say
cant control a starstudded cast
including flatulent star of the popular
fatties franchise jeff portnoy
let me tell you something
a lot of people are disrespecting me
they say that the movies
just about farts its about family
and you you cant do what i do
fresh from his most recent arrest
for heroin glue and crack possession
portnoy was almost uninsurable
also in the mix is booty sweathocking
hiphop hyphenate alpa chino
im so excited you know what im
saying about doing tropic thunder
hey drink booty sweat baby
drink booty sweat
but the real heavyweight on the set
is fivetime academy award winner
kirk lazarus
the brilliant australian
known for his bad boy antics offscreen
is famous for his total immersion
into any role he portrays
well being an actor is no different
well being an actor is no different
than being a rugby player
or a construction worker
save for the fact that my tools
are the mechanisms
that trigger human emotion
lazarus underwent a controversial
pigmentation alteration procedure
in order to play
the platoons africanamerican
sergeant lincoln osiris
yeah
trying to hold his own onscreen
with kirk
is action juggernaut tugg speedman
once the highest grossing star
in the world
lately his scorcher films
have lost their heat
recently speedman opened up to tyra
you have no real family
youre on the wrong side of 40
youre childless and alone
somebody close to you said
one more flop and its over
somebody said they were close to me
its been a tough year for tugg
the disappointing buddy comedy
chitlin  the dude
was followed by an illadvised venture
into serious dramatic territory
simple jack
the story of a mentally impaired
farmhand who can talk to animals
was a box office disaster
that many critics called
one of the worst movies of all time
i aint got a good brain
i think youve got a fine brain jack
you make me happy
but now the question is
can speedman make audiences happy
in whats being called
the most expensive
war movie never made
rick peck
wishing tugg all the best on that one
rumtumtuggernauts its the pecker
you got time for your agent
rick
hey buddy
guess who im staring at right now
what
im looking at your ugly mug

hey did you get the gift basket i sent
from rick

the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with
what do you mean
i mean we gotta shave your head
and get you back
on the monkey bars right
what
how did the crying scene go
horrible lazarus started crying
then he starts drooling and dribbling
and it wasnt even in the script
stop right there
you gotta buck up here tuggboat
who cares how much more talented
he may be than you
if he cries you cry harder man
didnt your dog have like leukemia

when you were a kid
i mean think of that
boom end of story

what
they have digital cable but
i mean its okay

it is not okay tugg
and you dont need to explain to me

clowns tugg speedman he cant cry
he cant cry
you know how you handle an actor
they whine about anything
you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass
you spank that ass les
what
spanking a child
turns him into a little snot
fear makes him a man
i know a place
where a mans worth is measured
in the ears hanging from his dog tags
the real deep shit
you wanna make this movie right
thats where you take
your pansyass actors
who is this guy
les thats four leaf
sergeant four leaf tayback
i wrote the book
youre a great american
this nation owes you a huge debt
now shut the fuck up
and let me do my job
look cockburn
yes
from now on my fist
is gonna be so far up your shithole
that every time you have a thought
its gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring
take control of your actors
or i will shut you down
diet coke
when the herd loses its way
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray
four leaf
come on over its okay
sit down
yes
so you dont like the hotel
beds give me nightmares
im guessing right about now
you couldnt find a dixie coonskin
with an ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way
what
i put my story in your limp brit hands
and you are not going to fail me
you think i was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting
you must put those boys in the shit
what i dont understand
you wanna make your movie or not
yes i do
all right you get
some of those little video type cameras
we take them out there and we put
them in the trees in different angles
then you give me
and that pyromaniac cody
all the smoke bombs charges
explosives detonators you got
then we take those boys up there
me and cody
we could light up that fucking jungle
so those lilydick actors
would be shitting their pants
and screaming for their mammies
theyd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home
i could do it
i could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style gritty dirty
get them away from their helpers
and asslicking assistants
put them in the real shit
real shit
with real fear in their eyes
real fear real emotion
yes four leaf yes
yes yes
yes yes

i just did the work
watched a lot of retarded people

sometimes we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt
thus we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it you know
yeah yeah live it yeah exactly
you know there were times
when i was doing jack
that i actually felt retarded
like really retarded
damn
like really retarded
damn
in a weird way

to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb
to be a moron

to be moronical
exactly to be a moron
an imbecile
yeah
like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived
when i was playing the character
when you was the character

what it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn
now whichever format porno backs

tugg speedman is dead meat
if we dont do something soon

by getting our asses back to the hotel
which is in the other direction
aint right
what wouldve happened
in the great escape
if steve mcqueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran
well thats what that movie was about
they were escaping they ran away
im trying to agree with you
the point is they did something
then what are we supposed to do huh
cause hes cleaning a gun
with no bullets yeah thats a plan
im just like a little boy
playing with his dick when hes nervous
wait a minute wait a minute
wait a minute
i got an idea
this might be a little crazy
crazys better than nothing
back in 98 i did a lowbudget
titty comedy for skinemax
sex camp remember it
yeah
anyway me and the campers
from the uncool camp
had to break into the rich girl camp
so what we did
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear
and they shot us over the wall
and we parachuted down
look
you guys we already know the plan
fine
we do it just like in the book
chapter 26 the wet offensive
the book of tropic thunder
yeah did you guys read the book
the flap i read the back flap
and saw the pictures
well its okay
its exactly the same as in the script
cool
you guys all read the script right
i dont read the script script reads me
what the hell does that even mean
what you getting at with the books
scripts spit that shit out man
all right the wet offensive
osiris and fats go undercover
as a diversion
motown and brooklyn sneak in
via the river
yeah but those dudes
was trained soldiers
yeah
and we trained actors motherfucker
time to man up
and i aint gonna sugarcoat
some of us
might not even make it back

earth mamas natural night camo

theyre gonna kill him
and well weep for him in the press
set up a scholarship in his name
eventually and im talking way
way down the road
we file an insurance claim
preferably before
the end of the fiscal year
actually the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose
you cant be serious
lets face it
the kids arent dressing up as scorcher
for purim anymore
speedman is a dying star
a white dwarf heading for a black hole
thats physics its inevitable
weve been handed
an incredible opportunity here peck
