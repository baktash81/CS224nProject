a vast  unexplored wilderness
shrouded in mystery  until now 
for i have been charged
by my fellow geographers
to leave the comforts of home and family
and set off upon a voyage of discovery 
i travel light  carrying only
the absolute essentials 
maps  rations  modest timepiece
and travel piano 
 piano clangs 
and finally  deep in the undergrowth 
i spot something extraordinary 
an undiscovered species of bear 
time to collect a specimen
for the museum 
 bear growls softly 
i thought my time was up 
my ticket was punched 
but the bear saved my life 
he guided me through the jungle
to show me his world 
and in return  i introduced him to ours 
that s  erm    that s a telescope 
that s my grandfather s telescope 
oh  be very careful with that 
  that s soap  really wouldn t eat that 
   bear chokes 
here we are  why don t you try this 
this is marmalade 
you spread it on toast 
put it in sandwiches  or   
or you can drink it  jolly good 
this is london  that s where i m from 
lon don 
good lord 
now try stratford upon avon 
over time  i become friends
with the bears and even name them 
the female after my dear departed mother
and the male after an exotic boxer
i once met in a bar 
but the time eventually comes
to return to my wife and daughter
and share my findings with the world 
goodbye  lucy  goodbye  pastuzo 
and if you ever make it to london 
you can be sure of a very warm welcome 
i have learnt so much from these bears
but i wonder what  if anything 
they have learnt from me 
 sniffs 
 gasps 
young male  marmalade 
they re ripe  they re ripe 
they re finally ripe 
aunt lucy 
uncle pastuzo 
you re never going to guess    whoa 
good morning  aunt lucy 
good morning  my little hurricane 
why do you have to come crashing in here
like a natural disaster 
but  uncle pastuzo    they re ripe 
 gasps 
pastuzo  whoa ho ho 
it s marmalade day 
young bear  marmalade day 
oh  it rather suits me  marmalade day 
 chuckles  oh  do calm down  you two 
there s no need to rush 
   bell dings 
   gasps   laughs 
now be careful up there 
and keep your paws off my hat 
young bear  i will 
lucy  marmalade 
just one sandwich contains
all the vitamins and minerals
a bear needs for a whole day 
  young bear  amazing 
  hmm 
pastuzo  and your aunt lucy s recipe
is even better than the explorer s 
we must remember to take him a jar
when we go to london 
young bear  london 
i wouldn t worry  we ve been talking
about that trip for 40 years 
one day  pastuzo 
but why would you want to go anywhere
when we live in
the best place in the world 
 branch snaps 
whoa 
whoo hoo 
lucy  goodness 
i thought i told you to be careful 
and give me back my hat 
  yes  uncle  but

around here 
embarrassing 
but tasty 
 laughs 
explorer  friendly advice for
the foreigner in london  lesson three 
it s dusk  and you pass a stranger
in the street 
  greet them politely 
  both  good evening 
to take the conversation further 
talk about the weather 
lucy  real brolly buster  isn t it 
fact  londoners have 107 ways
to say that it is raining   
  can i have the last sandwich 
  oh  no  i need that 
a wise bear always keeps
a marmalade sandwich in his hat
in case of emergency 
   and it s bucketing down 
follow these simple rules and you will
always feel at home in london 
 rumbling 
 rumbling grows louder 
  young bear  aunt lucy

 distant shouting

but    aren t you coming 
i am too old and too tired
to go any further 
oh  then  what will you do 
oh  don t you worry about me 
i will be safe
in the home for retired bears 
but it is not yet time
for you to retire 
you must find a new home  in london 
but    but i don t know anyone there 
what if they don t even like bears 
you know  there was once a war
in the explorer s country 
thousands of children
were sent away for safety 
left at railway stations
with labels around their necks 
and unknown families took them in
and loved them like their own 
they will not have forgotten
how to treat a stranger 
now take care  my darling 
remember your manners 
 man shouts nearby 
 whispers  and keep safe

  mary  excuse me  erm   
  bear  hello 
i m dreadfully sorry 
i don t actually know your name 
well  i ve got a bear name  but it seems

 uplifting music

do you know 
i was actually beginning to think
nobody would give me a home 
but this      chomps  that s ripe 
this will suit me down to the ground 
thank you very much 
   music stops abruptly 
  er    we re not giving you a home 
  oh 
  it s just for the night 
paddington  oh 
you see  when a young person
comes to this country 
i m afraid they don t just move in
with the first people they meet 
  paddington  no 
  you need a proper guardian 
what s that 
a grown up who takes you
into their home and looks after you 
like you 
erm    yes  well  i suppose so 
but not you 
no  we don t do that 
  it s normally someone you know 
  but what if you don t know anybody 
in that case  the authorities will house
you in some kind of government facility 
what  like an orphanage 
 dramatic organ music 
no  no  no  not an orphanage 
it would be more like an institution
for young souls
whose parents have sadly passed on 
 dramatic organ music 
oh 
  well  what about the explorer 
  who 
the man who visited us in darkest peru 
he said we d always be welcome 
well  what s his name  you could go now 
ooh  well  i don t know his human name 
my uncle and aunt hadn t learnt
much english back then 
so they always called him     roars 
there can t be that many explorers
who ve been to peru 
maybe we can find him 
without a name 
i wouldn t get your hopes up 
right  come on  you  pyjamas 
henry  jonathan 
  walk 
   jonathan huffs 
don t worry  paddington 
  we ll find him

i beg your pardon 
you know  use the facilities 
most people do after a long journey 
oh  well  if that s what most people do 
then i d like to do that 
  top of the stairs

and i still don t trust you 
hmm   
hmm 
 sighs contentedly 
woman  thank you for holding

  woman     important to us 
 strains 
 sniffs 
 sighs 
 gasps 
help

  no  darling  really 
  that s it 
  when can i meet him 
can i meet him  darling 
  he can sleep in my room 
  he s not sleeping in anyone s room 
he s going in the attic 
i want you all to lock your doors 
i can t find anything
about an english explorer in peru 
  henry  of course you can t 
  why not 
he s making the whole thing up  it s the
sort of sob story your mother falls for 
  hang on  that s not fair 
  judy  it so is fair 
you ve literally just brought home
a random bear 
  so embarrassing 
  you d have done the same thing 
we re much more similar than you think 
  what are you doing 
  the storm is upon us 
oh  you and your knees 
i can tell you for a fact  mrs bird 
it is not going to rain indoors 
  oh  no 
  there she blows 
  mr brown  are you there 
  yes  hello 
yes  that sounds fine 
no  no  no  don t read me
the terms and conditions 
i want to action this as soon
as possible  don t put me on hold again 
paddington  what is going on in there 
er  nothing  i m just having
a spot of bother with the facilities 
 henry yells 
 paddington yells 
 juddering yell 
erm    nice weather for the ducks 
   rubber duck squeaks 
  oh 
that was amazing 
 wind blows   paddington sighs 
paddington  dear aunt lucy 
i have arrived in london
and so far it has rained  poured 
drizzled and chucked it down 
and i miss you 
london is not how we imagined it 
hardly anyone says hello or wears hats 
and you can no longer simply
turn up at the station and get a home 
it s hard to see where a bear
could ever belong
in such a strange  cold city 
luckily  i met the browns  who are
letting me sleep in their attic 
they have a lovely house  but i m not
going to be allowed to stay 
henry  that animal is going
straight to the authorities 
  mary  what about the explorer 
  henry  there is no explorer 
i m not putting this family in danger
while you go on some wild goose chase 
first thing tomorrow 
that bear is out of here 
paddington 
the browns are a very curious tribe 
mr brown is something called
a risk analyst 
he says that having a bear in the house
increases the chances of major disaster
by 4 000  
mrs brown illustrates adventure stories 
her latest is set in the old tunnels
and sewers under london 
she says she s stuck at the moment
because she can t imagine
what her hero looks like 
but has no trouble coming up with
nicknames for her daughter judy 
  like  twinkle  and  coconut  and   
  sweety pops  hello  darling 
i was thinking of going
to the sewers tomorrow night 
i just wondered if you wanted
to join me  you could bring this tony 
why would i want to bring anyone
down the toilet 
come on  darling  it s not like that 
it s a subterranean labyrinth
that can take you anywhere in the city 
it s weird  it smells
and it s embarrassing 
sure  good point 
paddington  judy suffers
from a serious condition
called  embarrassment  
she is seeing a boy called tony
but won t bring him home 
  so  when can i come round your house 
  that s never gonna happen 
she is learning chinese   
man  could you tell me the way
to the central business district 
paddington     so she can run away
and start a small business 
man  i have been accused
of insider trading
and require legal representation 
paddington  when jonathan grows up 
he wants to be an astronaut 
last year he built
a pair of rocket boots   
three  two  one 
   and is now only allowed to play
with safe  educational  indoor toys
from the olden days 
 jonathan sighs 
paddington  they live with
an old relative called mrs bird 
her husband was in the navy  and she
still likes everything shipshape 
tomorrow  they are taking me
to the authorities 
who will house me in something
that is not an orphanage 
but still doesn t sound like the sort
of home we were really hoping for 
can t you sleep 
me neither 
paddington  i do wish
we could have found the explorer 
mary  i know  paddington 
but i ve been looking everywhere
and i still can t find any mention
of an english expedition to peru 
but there really was an explorer 
mrs brown  he gave my uncle this hat 
what  that was the explorer s hat 
hm hmm  why 
i ve got a friend who runs
an antiques shop in the portobello road 
he knows all about old things
like your hat 
oh   
it s just possible
he could help us find your explorer 
well  that would be wonderful 
  but didn t mr brown say   
  don t you worry about mr brown 
as far as he s concerned 
we re going to the authorities 
but i m not standing by while there s
a chance of finding you a proper home 
now make sure you get some sleep  ok 
mary  night night 
paddington  tomorrow 
we are going to find the explorer 
love from paddington

yes

a fantastic addition to the collection 
grant  aren t you worried
people will ask questions 
not at all  as far as the tree huggers
who run this place are concerned 
i d never dream of stuffing
a poor defenceless animal 
however  it s not enough for me just
to look after this dusty old collection 
i need to add the odd choice specimen
of my own 
there was some weird sort of animal
at the dock today 
woman  oh  yes 
grant  yeah  i was doing
my rounds as usual
when i spotted something sticky
on the deck of the boat 
i think they were paw prints 
whatever it was that had made them
had hidden himself away in the lifeboat 
must have been in there
all the way from peru 
seems to have lived
on nothing but marmalade 
did you say marmalade 
  hmm 
  what happened to him 
  he sneaked out in the mail van 
  yes 
  i tracked him to paddington 
  good 
but then he disappeared 
i m sorry  it s just that that creature
means a great deal to me 
why  is he endangered 
he is now 
 yawns 
 coos

mr gruber  but i soon learnt a home

my body had travelled very fast
but my heart   
she took a little longer to arrive 
hmm 
but now i should like
to take a look at your hat 
  oh  thank you 
  unusual colour 
but it is hard to say how much of that
is original and how much   
marmalade 
my uncle always kept
a marmalade sandwich in his hat
in case of emergency 
you re pulling my legs off 
what a splendid idea 
mr gruber 
ooh  now  if you look carefully 
you can see your hat
has been hand stitched 
which suggests it is one of a kind 
  mary  really 
  yes

that scoundrel has been pocket picketing
people around here for weeks 
mary  he was extraordinary 
mr gruber  and it gave me
a chance to look at his hat 
  you see  this is no ordinary hat 
  paddington  no 
no  these markings mean that it was made
for a member of the geographers  guild 
what s that 
mr gruber  a very old explorers  club 
  oh

  are you doing the breathing 
  i m doing the breathing 
all we need to do is take him
to the geographers  guild 
  stop 
  the hand s gone up 
  we ve done quite enough for this bear 
  and the voice 
  henry  i am taking charge 
  mary  you re taking charge 
henry  yes  paddington
is a danger to this family 
jonathan is quite irresponsible enough
without throwing a wild animal
into the mix 
hey  paddington 
have you seen the paper 
paddington  gosh 
you ve only been in london a day
and you re already famous 
oh 
i m sorry if i wasn t very nice before 
it s just it s a new school and i didn t
want everyone to think i was weird 
oh  i understand  judy 
it s not easy being somewhere new 
no  it isn t 
henry  he put earwax on my toothbrush 
things can be very different
from how you imagined 
don t let him bother you  dad s always
been boring and annoying 
oh  i don t know about that 
more to your father than meets the eye 
  like what 
  when i first met him 
he was a very different man 
 rock music 
  get your motor running
whoo 
    head out on the highway
  wahey 
    looking for adventure
  that s my girl 
  and whatever comes our way
  not gonna let this change us  right 
  no way  baby 
    born to be wild
  we re having a baby 
 mary squeals 
 baby cries 
mrs bird  but becoming a father
does strange things to a man 
be careful  there s a baby here 
step back  there s a baby coming through 
could you keep those flowers away  please 
she s too young for pollen 
  where s the bike  darling 
  this is our new car 
what  it s very beige  isn t it 
it s a calm and neutral colour  get in 
the point is  your father loves you
very much  give him a chance 
he might just surprise you 
paddington  oh 
maybe you and dad
just need a fresh start 
paddington  hmm 
i suppose i didn t make
the best first impression 
don t take this the wrong way but   
why don t we try to make you
look a bit more presentable 
hang on a minute 
you re not talking about   
     the facilities 
   children laugh 
  relax  paddington  it s not that bad 
  it is that bad 
doesn t it rain enough in this city
without having showers in the house 
 grunts 
the point is  we are parents now
and we have to protect our children 
  we do 
   laughter 
  they re screaming 
  that s the sound of laughter 
wind  hot wind  two hot winds 
paddington  i don t like it 
 hairdryers stop 
well  i hope i don t look weird
after all that 
  too much 
  too much 
too much 
well  get me a brush  will you 
ah  there it is 
  that s my old duffle coat 
  actually  it was mine first 
well  long before that  it was mine 
  oh  was it  mr brown 
  really 
  he wore it on his first day at school 
  it s lovely 
wooden buttons for ease of paw 
and these two sandwich compartments
are an excellent idea 
i must say  it suits you very well 
i never thought
i d like a human coat  but   
mary  you look like one of the family 
you re not going to send paddington
to the authorities  are you 
you will try the geographers  guild 
yes  alright  we ll see
if they know anything 
  but if it s a dead end   
  i m sure it won t be 
thank you very much  mr brown 
you must get a lot of strange customers
in here 
you don t know the half of it  love 
i ve had bishops  magicians  bears 
contortionists 
did you say bears 
yeah  had one in here last night 
actually 
oh  how fascinating  i don t suppose
you remember where you took him 
   fraid i can t tell you that  love 
  why not 
  it s against the cabbie s code  innit 
  the what 
the cabbie s code 
it s an oath of confidentiality we take 
you know  like your doctors 
your priests  your medieval knights 
you do understand  don t you  love 
of course 
   driver whimpers 
  let me tell you about my code 
when somebody doesn t give me
what i want  i remove their body parts 
i start with the nasal hair 
ow 
and then i move on to something juicy 
that s my code and i always stick to it 
do you always stick to yours 
  well  it s not even really a code 
  no 
it s more a set of guidelines
than a binding ethos 
then tell me 
where did you take the bear 
  windsor gardens 
  thank you 
i wouldn t go up the westway this
time of night  you wanna go north   
 screams   splash 
  jonathan  bye  paddington 
  goodbye  jonathan 
  judy  good luck 
  mary  bye  paddington 
paddington  bye 
i hope you all have a good day 
i really do like these french
sandwiches  mrs bird  very exotic 
  mr curry  can i help you  son

advertising in a public phone box 
i m terribly sorry 
  hello  by lionel richie    hello

i can see   
   song stops abruptly 
  no problem    madam 
many apologies if i disturbed you

i keep an eye on all
the comings and goings and   
there s been a few unsavoury
characters hanging around 
henry  let s get this
over and done with 
there s even been a bear 
a most unpleasant creature 
as a matter of fact 
that bear is the reason i m here 
woman  welcome to the
geographers  guild  are you members

 bell rings 
 bell rings 
 capsule lands   small bell rings 
  hmm 
  hmm 
we ve never been to peru 
what  but you must have done 
i can see you re very busy 
perhaps we could just go and check 
there are over two million letters 
diaries and artefacts up in our archive 
meticulously filed 
and they don t stay that way
by letting strange men
and their bears rummage around 
  listen   
  i m going to have to ask you to leave 
come on then  paddington 
paddington 
paddington 
  paddington 
  psst  mr brown  in here

 sighs 
paddington 
please don t take this the wrong way 
but are you certain
there was an explorer 
you didn t just find a hat
and make up some   
what  why are you looking at me
like that 
is it me or is it hot in here 
why do i feel so   
  uncomfortable 
  hmm 
  flushed 
  hmm 
  queasy 
  hmm 
it s called a hard stare 
my aunt taught me to do them
when people had forgotten their manners 
  oh  give me strength 
  mr brown  you can trust me 
there really was an explorer 
and if we can find him 
i know he ll give me a home 
a proper home  like yours 
now i ve got an idea 
but i m going to need your help 
 lift pings 
  this is never going to work 
  paddington  of course it will 
  you look very pretty 
  that s what they ll say in jail 
  morning 
   high pitched  oh  hello there 
hold up 
haven t seen you before  have i

 bell rings 
 capsule lands   small bell rings 
paddington  what is it

guard  oi 
new girl

o o 2  retrieve 
 bell rings   pipe whirs 
 small bell rings

 pipe whirs   small bell rings

well  i m just off to the toilet 
see you in a bit 
mr brown  i ve found something 
that s brilliant  now let s put

  er    mr brown   
  ah 
 baguette squeaks through the pipe 
 pipes whistle as pressure builds 
something s jamming the system 
i think it s a baguette

too orange  i think it s   
marmalade 
 alarm 
 all gasp 
hey  you 
guard  stop that sexy woman 
halt 
 small explosion 
  you have a beautiful home  mr curry 
  i ve lived here all my life 
i inherited it from my mother 
a very distant woman 
and being such a pillar
of the community  i can see why
having that beast move in next door
would upset you so 
i suppose i should be grateful
that it s only one bear 
oh  but it always starts
with just one  mr curry 
soon  the whole street
will be crawling with them 
drains clogged with fur 
buns thrown at old ladies 
raucous all night picnics 
  what can we do 
  i have certain connections 
if i can get hold of the bear  i can see
that he s sent where he belongs 
  no questions asked 
  really 
but i can t do it alone  i need
a strong  capable man to help me 
me  oh  now   
if i start hanging around 
people will ask questions 
but you  you could keep an eye on him 
couldn t you  for me 
of course 
perfect  so you do that 
soon as he s alone  we ll pounce 
henry  fire her up  mr gruber 
  jonathan  you actually broke in 
  that s right 
sounds incredibly brave 
there s a time for being boring and
annoying  and a time for being a man 
mr brown dressed up as a lady
and someone stuck pins in him 
  what 
  it s starting 
  what was that 
  doesn t matter 
  in a dress 
  no 
did look like a dress 
more of a housecoat 
quite liberating  actually 
darkest peru 
a vast  unexplored wilderness 
shrouded in mystery  until now 
judy  is that where you re from 
mary  oh  paddington  it s incredible 
 sniffs 
explorer  goodbye  lucy 
goodbye  pastuzo 
and if you ever make it to london

montgomery clyde 
paddington  dear aunt lucy 
you ll never guess what 
today i saw a film the explorer made
of darkest peru 
i do miss our old home  although i m
beginning to understand life in london 
the browns are a curious tribe 
but i rather like them 
the way mr brown
arranges his stationery 
the strange objects
mrs brown finds in her handbag 
ah  there you are 
how mrs bird has a hoover
for every occasion 
that judy can master any language 
even bear 
 judy growls 
wonderful pronunciation 
paddington  and how jonathan
can build almost anything
using only mr brown s
educational old toys 
this is amazing 
it s very strange 
i may be about to find the explorer 
but i m actually beginning
to feel at home here 
paddington  these books
contain the names and addresses
of all the people who live in london 
if we look up every  m clyde  
we ll find your explorer 
  thank you  mrs brown 
  henry  let s get cracking 
wait for me 
i ll see if i can find anything
about captain clyde in the library 
i ll come with you  i need to refresh
our marmalade supplies 
shouldn t someone stay with paddington 
it s only for a few hours 
you don t need to worry  mr brown 
i think i ve got the hang of things 
well  you take care

i m sorry  but that was the last straw 
it was an accident  they happen 
  but the children   
  paddington s the best thing
that s ever happened to the children 
they re happy 
but what s the point of them being happy
if they re not safe 
he s putting them in danger 
they have to be our number one priority 
they are 
they are 
and the worst part is
he won t even tell us the truth 
how can he live with us
if we can t even trust him 
mary  i don t know  henry 
henry  we ve got to face facts 
this house just isn t the place
for a bear

i m sorry about her 
she s weird  er  but we all are 
tea  anyone  no  no 
paddington  and mr brown is helping
jonathan build an enormous rocket 
are you sure about this  dad 
if we re gonna get
this bad boy into orbit 
we re gonna need all the nitroglycerin 
although jonathan worries about his
father s reckless attitude to safety 
houston  we may have a problem 
duck 
 explosion 
paddington  mrs brown says that
in london  everyone is different 
but that means anyone can fit in 
i think she must be right 
because although i don t look like
anyone else  i really do feel at home 
i will never be like other people 
but that s alright 
because i am a bear 
a bear called paddington 
jonathan  come on  paddington 
  i had to laugh
till i couldn t laugh no more
  like an old chinaman out on the floor
  pass me by  hopping like a clown
  i told meself
that he rarely go into town
  and there was also a rajah gentleman
  americans and british  west indians
  tell you one thing
that really amused me
  believe it or not
was a pretty japanese
  and they were singing
  ju ba  ju ba  a ju li ba
  they re jumping here
and they re jumping there
  with a boolah boolah boolah boolah
boolah boolah ee
  the people going crazy
mrs bird  ooh   laughs 
  london is the place for me
  london  that lovely city
  you could go to france or america
  india  asia or australia
  you re gonna come back to london city
  london is the place for me
  well  believe me 
i am speaking broad mindedly
  i am glad to know my mother country
  i ve been travelling
to countries years ago
  but this is the place i want to know
  london is the place for me
  london is the place for me
  to live in london 
you are really comfortable
  because the english people
are very much sociable
  they will take you here
and they ll take you there
  and make you feel like a millionaire
  london is the place for me
  london is the place for me
  at night  when you have nothing to do
  you can take a walk
down shaftesbury avenue
  there you could laugh and talk
and enjoy the breeze
  admire the beautiful sceneries
  london is the place for me
  london is the place for me
  i cannot complain
of the time i have spent
  i mean  my life in london
is really magnificent
