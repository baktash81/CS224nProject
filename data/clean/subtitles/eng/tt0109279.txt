as i am now   
   in this delicious place of water   
   and grass and sunlight 
mine is a story of trust and betrayal   
   and learning to trust again 
i remember everything 
i m here  duchess 
i ll help you 
come on  old lass 
come on  push 
push 
it was cold and too bright
and strange out in the air 
but then my mother kissed me 
i wanted to be nearer to her 
over here  little one  it s all right 
in the beginning  i stayed as close
to my mother as i possibly could 
as the weeks went by 
i still stayed right beside her   
   but i began to have my own ideas
of what we should do 
so much of the time 
she would just stand there 
hurry up 
let s go 
come on  come on 
i don t like this 
i do not like this 
don t fight me now 
everything s changing 
even i m changing 
come on 
a black coat s taking over my baby fur 
it s all happening too fast 
when i turned 3   
   my master sent me to spend the year
with a gang of other colts 
now it was time 
training 
the bit was the first thing 
terrible bars of cold  hard steel
between your teeth and over your tongue 
if you ve never had one in your mouth 
you can t imagine what a shock it is 
but thank heaven for oats 
when you re eating them 
you can forget the bit s nasty coldness   
   the bitter  metallic taste 
delicious oats 
sweet oats 
lovely  crunchy oats 
beautiful oats 
splendid oats    ow 
here  it s just a saddle 
it s choking me 
you can still move  promise 
nobody could walk with this 
come back here with those oats 
at first  the iron shoes made
my feet feel stiff and heavy 
i said   no   but he said   go  
come on 
once i discovered that he and i   
   that the two of us could become one   
   this business turned out to be
perfectly glorious 
it was now time for me
to go to a new home 
my mother was proud of me   
   and encouraged me 
she knew my master would only
let me go to good people 
but i would miss her 
before long  a man came
to take me to birtwick park   
   to live with squire gordon s family 
just a moment  molly 
  come here with that pony 
  run  merry  faster 
please stay inside 
you re still much too weak 
i won t break  i want to see him 
it s a horse  nothing more  nothing less 
i promise 
a beautiful horse 
beauty is as beauty does 
how was he  john 
perfect  sir 
they were shooting rabbits near highwood
and the guns went off 
he pulled at such  and looked 
but he didn t step off the path 
  did you  young fella 
  what shall we call him 
we ll decide over tea 
you must get out of this air 
he s as black as ebony 
ebony 
ebony 
sounds like  bones   
settle him in the stables 
pleasure  sir 
we ll call him blackbird 
after your uncle s old horse 
but blackbird was ugly
and mean tempered 
  wait  you ve already named him 
  pardon 
   beauty is as beauty does   
  that s not a name 
yes  it is  beauty 
black beauty 
a new name   
   a new home   
   and a stable full of new horses to meet 
she ll be all right 
she was ill tempered 
she was mean spirited 
she was vicious 
she was the most beautiful creature
i d ever seen 
i hate alfred 
me too 
let me down 
charge 
lazy pony 
move 
stop it 
move along 
merrylegs 
  quick  merrylegs 
  run 
keep running  merrylegs

merrylegs 
what a perfect name for the little fellow 
leave him alone 
whoa there  joe 
better let young joe catch him 
master alfred 
he needs the practice 
go on now  round them up 
thank you for offering to help 
i expect it s time for your tea now  isn t it 
yes  i expect it is 
tea time  girls 
jessica  molly  come along 
it s a good thing john came along
when he did 
it certainly is 
joe had a good heart   
   but really not a clue 
stand still  will you 
stop running 
come on  everybody 
what a wonderful place 
i flew down to her 
i knew it would be magic between us 
hey  wait a second 
what do you think you re doing 
please 
easy  ginger  easy 
  what s the matter with her 
  they must ve battered her 
we treat her well and give her her head 
she ll come round  surely enough 
back him on in 
kind treatment makes good horses  joe 
bad treatment ruins them 
straighten him out 
i can t 
yes  you can 
was i ever going to win her affection 
when we came to the hill   
   instead of slowing down
and leaving me to do the work   
   she threw her weight into the collar
and pulled away  straight up 
our paces matched perfectly 
i was sure that afterwards 
things would be different between us 
they were 
they were worse 
now she ignored me completely 
i bounded 
i leaped to the sky 
i tried everything to get her attention 
even though i was new   
   the squire and john trusted me to
get them safely back from town   
   no matter how terrible the storm 
the wild branches tried to grab me 
the rain stung my eyes
like a thousand bees 
keep moving  beauty 
the bridge was flooded 
but it looked safe 
as i reached the middle 
i knew at once that something was wrong 
beauty  forward 
go forward 
everything inside me screamed
not to go any further 
go forward 
i wanted to obey him but he was wrong 
i know  chum  i know 
how can i make you understand 
we can t go near there 
come on  beauty 
for me 
i stood fast 
i tried to tell him 
that s enough 
i didn t know how long
i could hold on to him 
i had to hold on 
god bless you  beauty 
what happened 
i ll be all right  mistress 
i just need to look after the horse 
you will not  you come inside at once 
beauty needs looking after 
i ll look after him  uncle john 
all right  do what i ve shown you  joe 
not joe 
he doesn t know what to do 
the drying sweat and rain sent a chill
down to my bones 
you don t need that rug 
you re boiling hot 
i wanted my rug 
i wanted a heap of rugs 
the icy water hit my stomach
like a kick in the guts 
but i was so thirsty 
by the next morning   
   i was sick 
ginger stayed up all night with me 
feeling sorry for me softened her 
oh  dear lord 
it hurts 
there s no rug put on 
stupid  stupid boy 
i expect the water was cold as well 
run to the house
and bring another blanket 
now 
come on

my good horse 
let s hope it does him some good 
you go on to bed now  john

every little noise was torture 
alfred  stop it

all right  i m coming 
what are you doing 
no  not the sheets 
sorry 
my mistress became so ill   
   we had to take her to a doctor   
   a specialist who lived far away 
you won t smoke that pipe
in these stables 
yeah  yeah  keep your shirt on  skinny 
evening 
evening 
that idiot left a lamp up here 
little know it all ought
to mind his own business 
you complain about my pipe 
but you leave a lamp near the hay 
for you to see by 
bring it down here  will you 
lucky for you i came up here 
what  what s that 
beauty  it s only for tonight 
what are you afraid of  you ll be all right 
i ll be back for the horse in the morning 
i m off too

the sounds and smells were so strange 
i didn t know what they were 
if you ve never heard or smelled
something  how can you understand it 
whoa  beauty  i m here 
i can t leave ginger 
i won t let it hurt you 
don t look at it 
i couldn t see anything 
i had to follow him 
joe saved us 
the other horses were rescued too 
but no one could help our mistress 
her illness was so advanced   
   that the doctor told her to move
to a warmer place 
the family would have to leave england   
   and us 
right this way  leaving in five minutes 
goodbye  john  bless you 
please god  we may see you
back again soon 
portsmouth train leaving
from platform one 
we love you  merrylegs 
you re the best 
we ll never forget you 
time to go  sisters 
i want to thank you  john 
for your faithful service to my family 
we shall never forget you  sir 
goodbye  my beauty 
nevermore were we to see our family 
nevermore 
it was our last time together
in the big pasture   
   but it was something nobody could
ever take away from us 
they were dancing 
the vicar came to take merrylegs away 
he d promised the squire
he would never sell him 
i hated saying goodbye
to that plucky little pony 
in no time  ginger and joe and i   
   also found ourselves miles away
from everything dear and familiar 
horses to the back 
what do you think you re doing 
i swear to you   
   someday  somehow   
   i ll be with you again 
take me with you now 
don t go 
but he was gone 
lady wexmire  lord wexmire   
   lord george 
they stared 
staring at us with their critical eyes 
to them  we were no more alive   
   than the bits of harness on our backs 
look at the long legs
on the chestnut mare 
what a hunter she d make 
she d fly over the jumps 
you must put these horses  heads higher 
they re not accustomed
to the bearing rein 
their groom said they d never used
the rein on either one 
  didn t he  york 
  he did  my lord 
be safer to bring them up by degrees 
pish posh 
these animals are not fit to be seen 
one notch tighter won t kill them  will it 
york 
as you wish  my lady 
reuben  attend to the mare 
when a bearing rein is tightened 
it pulls back your head   
   so that you have to carry it
uncomfortably high 
people think it makes a horse look fancy 
but it made ginger angry 
this was a very grand place we d come to 
three or four times the size
of birtwick park   
   but not at all pleasant   
   if a horse may have an opinion 
ordinarily  we would have
put our heads down and forward   
   but not now 
now we had to pull with our heads up 
pain shot through our backs and legs 
for what 
for fashion 
rein them tighter  york 
as you wish  my lady 
reuben  shorten the bearing rein
on the mare 
a bearing rein is well named 
for it is unbearable 
it makes no sense 
and nonsense can drive a horse mad 
rein them tighter  york 
as you wish  my lady 
i didn t know how much longer
ginger could stand it 
for pity s sake 
are you never going to get their heads up 
raise them at once 
as you wish  my lady 
quickly 
and then it happened 
you incompetent fool 
whoa  there 
keep a hold of her 
hang on 
i can t be late for the duchess 
get him  quick 
give it here  now  get that shaft off 
go on  get it 
the bloody rein s choking her 
there  lassie 
you idiot 
these horses have more brains than you 
cover the chestnut with a blanket 
you fetch hot water and lotion
for the black one 
whoa  there 
stay 
take care of the black one too 
as you wish  mr  york 
my leg hurt 
the wound was deep 
well  it s her own silly fault
if she misses her tea party   
   not yours 
no  nor mine neither 
it s enough to drive anybody back to drink 
they put wicked wooden contraptions
around our necks   
   so we couldn t even turn our heads
to lick our wounds 
after that   
   my lady never called for ginger again 
i  on the other hand   
   continued to be subject
to her every whim 
look  man  look 
got a job for us then  reuben 
yes  it s stood out in all weathers 
between that and the roads up there 
plenty of rot here 
plenty of rot everywhere 
what do they want to do 
me lady craves a new coat of paint 
i believe your lady could use
a good deal more than a new coat of paint 
amen 
keep the horse for me  will you 
best leave it saddled 
i daren t be late 
where are you going then 
i ll be back later 
listen 
there s a loose shoe 
where are you going 
you mustn t ride him  mr  smith 
now stand up  will you 
he s standing 
come on  there  come on 
now stand up 
where s your head 
get out of the way 
come on 
he pushed me   
   and pushed me   
   and pushed me 
what was the matter with him 
i was losing my shoe   
   but he had lost his mind 
my body couldn t escape   
   but my thoughts could 
they took me away from that awful place 
far away 
but there was reuben   
   still lying where he d fallen 
i stayed with him 
my mother had taught me to be loyal 
no matter what 
good lord  what s happened here 
roll him over 
see if we can get him to his feet 
i ll carry him 
every step was agony 
i didn t know if my knees would ever heal 
we don t get to choose the people
in our lives 
for us  it s all chance 
come on 
come on  get on  get on 
he won 
lovely ride  son 
thank you  mama 
good god  george 
what have you done to the horse 
didn t you bother to train her 
i won the race 
you ve broken her 
she can t breathe properly 
ginger loved jumping 
her heart leapt at every fence 
but they raced her before she was fit   
   and it shattered her 
they used to be such beautiful animals 
now just look at them  ruined 
a 12 month run should bring back
the mare s wind  my lord 
well  the black one will have to be sold 
i won t have knees like that in my stables 
sold 
every horse knows that terrifying word 
when they came to take me away 
it was so sudden   
   that ginger and i didn t even
get to say goodbye 
the terrible man who bought me
kept horses for rent 
suck it in 
i was rented out to anyone who wanted
to hire me 
i was glad my friends couldn t see me now 
they wouldn t even have known me 
we hated that man 
you missed me  you stupid beasts 
this horse is 20 if it s a day 
this lively place lifted my spirits 
i ll meet you after the fair  joe 
wait 
i know who that is 
it s joe 
older  taller   
   but it s him 
where d he go 
  what happened to his knees 
  stop 
  he took a spill in the stalls 
  a spill 
what are you doing  where s joe 
there he is 
let me go 
lively one  isn t he 
joe  don t leave 
i m here 
horses for sale 
twenty five guineas  he s yours 
fifteen 
  eighteen 
  sixteen 
  eighteen 
  seventeen  not a penny more 
done 
how are you supposed to get through 
there were too many people 
there was too much noise 
the smell was awful 
coming through  there s a lad 
where was the grass 
where were the trees 
excuse me 
it was cramped   
   and damp   
   and dank and dark and dreary 
jerry  what s wrong with him 
he s frightened 
step up 
let me go  i want to go and pet him 
give me a brush  dolly  don t worry 
harry  put some straw in that stall 
dolly  no 
it s all right 
come on  let s do it quietly 
give him a chance 
up we go  there we are 
thank you 
it s like baby fur here 
he s so soft 
yeah  he is 
come on  pol  give us a hand 
how s it going with that straw 
all ready 
go and get yourself a brush  then 
there 
he s not so frightened now 
and when he has to pull the cab 
have faith 
i listened quietly 
what should we call him 
jack  after the old one 
he s far blacker than jack 
when s he s cleaned 
his color comes up lovely 
  seeing something in him now  are you 
  i didn t say that 
all right 
we ll call you black  because you are 
and jack  after the old one 
and altogether  black jack 
because the odds are stacked   
   against us both 
black jack 
what you got 
black jack wants to be pretty 
good idea 
all at once  i had hope 
it s good people that make good places 
still  i wondered
what tomorrow would bring 
walk on  come on  that s it 
walk on 
  babaloo s food emporium 
  rat problem solved 
vermin exterminated 
easy  boy 
hello  jerry  have you got a good one

a bit like meself 
why shouldn t you be 
don t worry 
no worry  old black  old jack  old boy 
it s all right 
jerry s hands 
the quiet of them   
   gave me confidence 
we spent our days
at one cab stand or another   
   collecting passengers 
it was a hard life 
the streets are hard on a horse s feet 
the cab is hard on a horse s back 
but i was lucky 
i had jerry  we were in it together 
  morning 
  morning  dinah

it s our one day of rest 
but oughtn t we treat folks   
   the way we like to be treated 
you re giving me my sunday sermon
early today 
i know if my mother was dying   
a lighter cart would make
a wonderful difference to the horse 
look 
here comes butcher dawes now
to lend you his light trap 
you re a clever woman 
all right 
fix me some bread and cheese
and i ll get ready 
feel free to tie your horse with the cows 
the meadow belongs to us 
not to the estate 
i d rather set him loose  it d be a real treat
for him to have a turnout 
kind to me  kind to the horse   
run inside and see your mother 
you re a tough one  jerry 
how can a person ever repay you 
here we go 
here we go 
grass

i couldn t believe my eyes 
now  where s that biscuit 
running made me very happy 
why shouldn t jerry be happy too 
i want that 
give it to me 
give it here 
right 
thanks 
the visit to the country refreshed me 
but i found i couldn t stop thinking of her 
then as if by magic   
   there she was 
my beautiful ginger 
oh  god  she was skin and bones 
what had they done to her 
she was almost too weak
to know who i was 
it s me  ginger 
it s me 
the brightness was gone
from her beautiful eyes 
her face  once so full of spirit 
was now full of suffering 
i tried to comfort her 
i wanted her to know she wasn t alone 
don t give up  ginger 
get up 
get on with you 
my precious friend 
that night  i dreamed of her 
i dreamed of what was 
and i dreamed of what might have been 
i m here 
what is it 
and then i knew 
goodbye  my sweet one 
just be patient 
it s ladies and gents who pay our rent 
they ll be out anytime now  you ll see 
begging your pardon  sir 
i was engaged to come round at 9 00 
as it s after midnight 
perhaps they wouldn t 
you ll be wanted soon enough 
the party s nearly over 
we waited for our passengers 
and waited 
people aren t thoughtless just to horses 
they re also cruel to each other 
bless your heart  old man 
good night 
get a move on 
it s freezing 
just in a moment  sir 
don t be impertinent  we could ve had
two more drinks  in a moment  
walk on 
something was the matter 
jerry always looked after me 
but here was the boy instead 
harry  i didn t want to trouble them
in the house 
how s your dad 
it s in his lungs  mr  crenshaw 
i m very sorry 
doctor says he ll tell mom tonight 
he says dad can t drive cabs no more 
keep your chin up 
help your mom 
never drive a cab again 
how could that be 
it was good to be outside 
i wanted to go back to work 
no  black 
we re not going to the cab stand 
we re just stretching your old legs 
old jack 
  morning  dinah 
  morning  harry  is your mama home 
dolly  what do you think you re doing 
packing  we re moving to the country 
daddy s going to drive coaches  dinah
says he ll never have to drive a cab   
   ever again 
what would happen now 
even though cab work had taken its toll
on me   
   i had hoped to spend
the rest of my days with jerry 
goodbye   
   beautiful black 
daddy said to give you a kiss for him 
i was sent to a grain dealer  where
jerry expected me to be treated fairly 
but what he expected and what was   
   were as different as a kind word is
from a whiplash 
come on 
for two long years 
i pulled the heavy carts   
   until i could not pull anymore 
sixteen guineas for the pair 
wants you to ride and drive 
sixteen guineas 
who ll give me sixteen guineas 
anybody out there 
sixteen guineas for the pair 
it s not worth bothering about them 
there s nothing for them
but the butcher s knife 
i was too weak to care 
awful 
was that one a carriage horse  granddad 
he might have been anything 
he has a finer build than the other horses 
wouldn t you say  joe 
poor old thing 
expect we ll have better luck next month
at langley 
that voice 
it woke me up 
i knew that voice 
it was joe 
black beauty 
i m here  beauty 
i m here 
you re safe now 
i have now lived in
this happy place a whole year 
my strength and spirits are back 
joe promises me i ll never be sold 
my troubles are over   
   and i am at home 
often    
   i fancy i m still in the big pasture
