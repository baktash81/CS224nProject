davis dear champion
vending company comma
this letter is in regards to
a poor vending experience
at st andres
no wait
in regards to
vending machine number 714
located in
the intensive care unit
of saint andres hospital
i put five quarters
in the machine
and proceeded to push b2
which shouldve given me
the peanut mms period
regrettably it did not
i found this upsetting
as i was very hungry
and also my wife had died
10 minutes earlier
giggling
im not saying
that was your fault
we were in a car accident
remarkably
i escaped without a scratch
im not trying to
dramatize my claim
i just wanna be thorough
maybe i should start
from the beginning
alarm beeping
i get up every
morning at 530
i work in the markets
so its important
to get an early start
not to imply that its
any more important than say
panting
a baker or a toll collector
those are fine
respectable jobs
i just mean that i commute
train horn honks
i catch the 715
out of white plains
its pretty much the same
crowd during the week
john works the ground crew
at yankee stadium
the first time we met
he asked what i did
and i told him
uh retail mattresses
retail mattresses
thats amazing
davis i dont know why
it just popped into my head
i avoided him
after that cause
i couldnt stand
his hot coffee breath
excuse me
i think he knew
i never thought id
be one of those people
who carried a briefcase
it always reminds me of
carrying a lunch box
to school
do they still make those
mister mitchell
morning
davis julias father is
a founding partner
at the investment firm
i work at
nepotism in its truest form
he started grooming me
when i was 27
i hate that word
monkeys groom
wavin at you from over here
can you see me buddy
its a small firm
but we handle
quite a bit of money
i dont wanna say how much
cause i think
it would be inappropriate
just look over
where the money is
okay its 6 billion
emerging markets
infrastructure
power plants
telecom sea world
windshield wipers
mmmhmm
you name it
doesnt matter what industry
we buy em cheap
and we sell it for a bundle
but none of its real
nothing to hold in my hands
its all just numbers
computer codes
being transferred
electronically
through the air
right in front of us
phil the french poet
paul valery
was right when he said
the future isnt
what it used to be
davis phil eastwood
my fatherinia w
fil phil
i think
the acronym is hysterical
i know phil is
spelled with a ph
but it still makes
me laugh in my head
phil davis
greeting in korean
bullshit
davis i met julia at a party
lizard on tv who put
that goddamn chair there
not my chair
not my chair not my problem
thats what i say
davis a mutual friend said
she thought i was hot
i returned the compliment
lizard i like things with
seashells and seahorses
on em
like blankets and towels
davis we had sex about
three hours later
echoing forever
forever
davis i dont think phil
liked me that much at first
i grew up in jersey
chuckles
i didnt come from money
and i puked
on the ice sculpture
at our engagement party
also he told me once
i dont like you davis
julia was a nice girl
a good person
she worked with
special needs children
she snorted when she laughed
and cried every time
they showed
footage of the towers falling
other than that
i dont think i knew
who she really was
she always said
i didnt pay attention
children laughing
perhaps youll find
this information irrelevant
in your deliberation
of my refund
but i think you deserve
the whole story
sincerely davis c mitchell
you okay
alarm beeping
panting
davis morning
morning amy is that me

companies to buy

some momentum going
davis lets grab a drink

we havent
really talked davis
not since everything

but in my life
and uh
clears t hro at
you keep your emotions
close to the vest

for the atmosphere
it just occurred to me

that needs looking after
its the insurance policy

recent developments
in my claim for reimbursement
and id like to
represent myself

daviss mom

davis first
there was a strange package
blocking my garage
davis mom
i think its
a cappuccino machine
i didnt order
a cappuccino machine
it was in julias name
davis then my dad was
fertilizing the lawn
at 700 in the morning
dad what are you doing

you should do this
you need to
get the soil ready
i have someone for that
do they know
about gypsy moths
what
gypsy moths
theyll destroy your trees
it starts as a caterpillar
they eat the leaves
lay eggs
and theyre coming here
to this neighborhood
well
they dont know for sure
but you should tell
your guy to spray
davis and of course
the train incident
i feel like i should
tell you something
um im in finance
i dont know why i told you
that i worked in
the mattress business
i guess i didnt
expect to see you
every day for five years
you think im a dick
i dont work for
the yankees anymore

a drainage issue
in the visitors bullpen
scoffs
i work security now
at parade of shoes in midtown

jeez
i didnt love my wife
i know its sad
its sad to say
but now that shes gone
i dont even feel sad
or pain or hurt or
well what do you feel
davis i couldnt tell you
why i did it
brakes screeching
shouting
so thats when you pulled it
davis maybe because
i was finally being honest
yes
and you knew that would
stop the train correct
well i wasnt positive
but i was hoping
davis all i can say is
it felt like
a legitimate emergency
whispering
his wifejust died
daviss mom
davis maybe you should
come stay with us for a while
take it easy
we have the extra room
i could sure use help
putting that gazebo together
hows that sound
chuckles
daviss dad remember
to tell your guy to spray
airplane taking off
hello again
its davis mitchell
my parents left
for tampa this afternoon
and i stayed at the airport
an extra two hours
watching people
walk back and forth
with their luggage in tow
camera clicking
i find im suddenly
filled with wait
overwhelmed by
a growing sense
of curiosity
what are in these bags
i wanna know what these people
cant do without
for four days in buffalo
i wanna go through
every one of them
and dump their shit
in a huge pile
and the national guard guy
i wanna hold his gun
alarm blaring
i wanna protect my country
panicked shouting
beeping
panting
im starting to notice things
i never saw before
well
maybe i saw them
i just wasnt
paying attention
sighing deeply
for some reason
everything has become
a metaphor
softly metaphor
metaphor
i am the uprooted tree
no wait
i am the storm
that uprooted the tree
i am the cold front
that collided with
the lowpressure system
too much
train horn honks
train bell clanging
morning amy
put a stamp on that
theres something else
dearest vending company
its been scratching
at the inside of my head
creaking
i couldnt take it
one second longer
the goddamn refrigerator
was leaking
dripping
now i wouldnt say
im handy by any means
mechanically retarded
would be closer to the truth
but phil said it himself
if you wanna
fix something
you have to take
everything apart
davis and figure out
whats important
whatll make you stronger
phil
repairing the human heart
is like repairing
an automobile
just examine everything
then you can put it
all back together
panting
davis
put it all back together
hmm

some people
wallow through their grief
my wife she cooks

into my phone

theres something else
i wanted to bring
to your attention
regarding your claim
okay
during our previous
conversation
you implied that my job
wasnt a profession
oh well im sorry
i didnt mean it as an insult
i know but it made me think
and i concluded that
you might be right
phil god bless con ed
and there was light
yeah ive gotta go
thank you for dinner
really
davis moreno means brown
in spanish did you know that
karen yes i did of course
do you have brown hair
karen no its blonde
davis are you
of spanish descent

indistinct conversations
excuse me
is karen moreno here
who
blonde hair hazel eyes
but not hispanic like
her name suggests
cell phone buzzing
hi where are you
karen
i was there in the diner
i sat in a booth
for a few minutes
i even played a song
on the little baby jukebox
and then
i dunno i got sad so i left

a shadowy figure
smoking pot in a corolla
you know what i should go

no no no wait i have
another letter here for you
put it in the mail
steven
i think its for real phil
if their
second quarter earnings
are an indication of growth
even just two
or three percent
then its a risk worth taking
davis do you need some paper
is there something
youd like to
contribute to the discussion
yes actually
but its more of a question
would any of you consider
crazy on you to be a sad song
and thats from you know
assuming
that youre familiar with
the heart catalog
indistinct conversations
let me go crazy
crazy on you
elevator bell dings
electronic voice going down
crazy on you playing
davis humming in his head

harder to answer

the door was squeaking
and it had probably been that
way for quite some time

all different kinds
of things phil
and i wanna see how they work
like that clock
pure craftsmanship artistry
that belonged to my
greatgrandmother 1890s

your greatgrandmother

on the corner of his desk
with his sleeves rolled up
like hes about
to dig a ditch
chuckles

youre gay chris
i have to try not to look
i have to tell myself not to

you know

sometimes i imagine
his dick in my mouth
oh
thats different
uh i would say that
youre probably gay
i mean you know

gonna get tortured um
