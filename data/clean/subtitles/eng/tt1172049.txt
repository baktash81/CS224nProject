davis  dear champion
vending company  comma 
this letter is in regards to
a poor vending experience
at st  andre s   
no  wait 
in regards to
vending machine number 714
located in
the intensive care unit
of saint andre s hospital 
i put five quarters
in the machine 
and proceeded to push b2 
which should ve given me
the peanut m m s  period 
regrettably  it did not 
i found this upsetting
as i was very hungry 
and also  my wife had died
10 minutes earlier 
 giggling 
i m not saying
that was your fault 
we were in a car accident 
remarkably 
i escaped without a scratch 
i m not trying to
dramatize my claim 
i just wanna be thorough 
maybe i should start
from the beginning 
 alarm beeping 
i get up every
morning at 5 30 
i work in the markets
so it s important
to get an early start 
not to imply that it s
any more important than  say 
 panting 
a baker or a toll collector 
those are fine 
respectable jobs 
i just mean that i commute 
 train horn honks 
i catch the 7 15
out of white plains 
it s pretty much the same
crowd during the week 
john works the ground crew
at yankee stadium 
the first time we met 
he asked what i did 
and i told him   
uh  retail mattresses 
retail mattresses 
that s amazing   
davis  i don t know why 
it just popped into my head 
i avoided him
after that  cause
i couldn t stand
his hot coffee breath 
excuse me   
i think he knew 
i never thought i d
be one of those people
who carried a briefcase 
it always reminds me of
carrying a lunch box
to school 
do they still make those 
mister mitchell 
morning 
davis  julia s father is
a founding partner
at the investment firm
i work at 
nepotism in its truest form 
he started grooming me
when i was 27 
i hate that word 
monkeys groom 
wavin  at you from over here 
can you see me  buddy 
it s a small firm 
but we handle
quite a bit of money 
i don t wanna say how much 
 cause i think
it would be inappropriate 
just look over
where the money is 
okay  it s  6 billion 
emerging markets 
infrastructure 
power plants 
telecom  sea world 
windshield wipers   
mmm hmm 
you name it 
doesn t matter what industry 
we buy  em cheap 
and we sell it for a bundle 
but none of it s real 
nothing to hold in my hands 
it s all just numbers 
computer codes
being transferred
electronically
through the air 
right in front of us 
phil  the french poet 
paul valery 
was right when he said 
 the future isn t
what it used to be  
davis  phil eastwood 
my father in ia w 
f i l  phil 
i think
the acronym is hysterical 
i know phil is
spelled with a p h 
but it still makes
me laugh in my head 
phil  davis 
 greeting in korean 
bullshit 
davis  i met julia at a party 
lizard on tv  who put
that goddamn chair there 
not my chair   
not my chair  not my problem 
that s what i say 
davis  a mutual friend said
she thought i was hot 
i returned the compliment 
lizard     i like things with
seashells and seahorses
on  em 
like blankets and towels   
davis  we had sex about
three hours later 
 echoing  forever   
forever   
davis  i don t think phil
liked me that much at first 
i grew up in jersey 
 chuckles 
i didn t come from money 
and i puked
on the ice sculpture
at our engagement party 
also  he told me once   
i don t like you  davis 
julia was a nice girl 
a good person 
she worked with
special needs children 
she snorted when she laughed
and cried every time
they showed
footage of the towers falling 
other than that 
i don t think i knew
who she really was 
she always said
i didn t pay attention 
 children laughing 
perhaps you ll find
this information irrelevant
in your deliberation
of my refund 
but i think you deserve
the whole story 
sincerely  davis c  mitchell 
you okay 
 alarm beeping 
 panting 
davis  morning 
morning  amy  is that me 
yeah    that s it 
great  put this in
the outgoing mail

worth of
companies to buy

phil 
they called the house

two weeks out from lightyear 
and i gotta get
some momentum going 
davis  let s grab a drink 
you know 
the cocktails run
about 18 bucks a pop here 
i don t get it 
we haven t
really talked  davis 
not since    everything 
i loved julia 
so much 
it s a father s love 
a man loses his wife 
he s a widower 
a child loses a parent 
they re an orphan 
but losing a child   
there s no word for this 
and there shouldn t be 
but you   
you and i have to continue on 
i want you to know
you ve been a value to me 
and not just in business 
but in my life 
and  uh   
 clears t hro at 
you keep your emotions
close to the vest 
that s good  that s strong 
i do the same 
it s the atmosphere 
what 
that s why the drinks
are so expensive 
you re paying
for the atmosphere 
it just occurred to me 
davis  listen 
there s some other business
that needs looking after 
it s the insurance policy 
i d like to take her money
and start a foundation
in julia s name 
foundaï¬‚on  
ph i l 
a merit based scholarship
awarded annually
to one student
who s most deserving 
davis  how much

steven s gonna get
the ball rolling 
this ll be her legacy 
legacy   
davis  dear
champion vending company 
this is davis mitchell  again 
there have been some
recent developments
in my claim for reimbursement 
and i d like to
represent myself
as accurately as possible 
davis s mom 
dinner s ready  son 
davis  first 
there was a strange package
blocking my garage 
davis  mom 
i think it s
a cappuccino machine 
i didn t order
a cappuccino machine 
it was in julia s name 
davis  then  my dad was
fertilizing the lawn
at 7 00 in the morning 
dad  what are you doing 
it s the season  davis 
you should do this 
you need to 
get the soil ready 
i have someone for that 
do they know
about gypsy moths 
what 
gypsy moths 
they ll destroy your trees 
it starts as a caterpillar 
they eat the leaves 
lay eggs   
and they re coming here 
to this neighborhood 
well 
they don t know for sure 
but you should tell
your guy to spray 
davis  and of course 
the train incident   
i feel like i should
tell you something 
um  i m in finance 
i don t know why i told you
that i worked in
the mattress business 
i guess i didn t
expect to see you
every day for five years 
you think i m a dick 
i don t work for
the yankees anymore 
got fired over
a drainage issue
in the visitors  bullpen 
 scoffs 
i work security now
at parade of shoes in midtown 
 laughing 
fuckin  job  excuse me 
my little prick of a boss 
he s 30 years younger than me 
i just wanna go in there
and smash
his little prick face 
 both laughing 
jeez 
i didn t love my wife 
i know  it s sad   
it s sad to say 
but now that she s gone 
i don t even feel sad
or pain or hurt  or   
well  what do you feel 
davis  i couldn t tell you
why i did it 
 brakes screeching 
 shouting 
so that s when you pulled it 
davis  maybe because
i was finally being honest 
yes 
and you knew that would
stop the train  correct 
well  i wasn t positive 
but i was hoping 
davis  all i can say is 
it felt like
a legitimate emergency 
 whispering 
his wifejust died 
davis s mom 
davis  maybe you should
come stay with us for a while 
take it easy 
we have the extra room 
i could sure use help
putting that gazebo together 
how s that sound 
 chuckles 
davis s dad  remember
to tell your guy to spray 
 airplane taking off 
hello again 
it s davis mitchell 
my parents left
for tampa this afternoon 
and i stayed at the airport
an extra two hours
watching people
walk back and forth
with their luggage in tow 
 camera clicking 
i find i m suddenly
filled with    wait   
overwhelmed by   
a growing sense
of curiosity   
what are in these bags 
i wanna know what these people
can t do without
for four days in buffalo 
i wanna go through
every one of them
and dump their shit
in a huge pile 
and the national guard guy 
i wanna hold his gun 
 alarm blaring 
i wanna protect my country 
 panicked shouting 
 beeping 
 panting 
i m starting to notice things
i never saw before 
well   
maybe i saw them 
i just wasn t
paying attention 
 sighing deeply 
for some reason 
everything has become
a metaphor 
 softly  metaphor   
metaphor   
i am the uprooted tree 
no  wait   
i am the storm
that uprooted the tree 
i am the cold front
that collided with
the low pressure system 
too much 
 train horn honks 
 train bell clanging 
morning  amy 
put a stamp on that 
there s something else 
dearest vending company 
it s been scratching
at the inside of my head 
 creaking 
i couldn t take it
one second longer 
the goddamn refrigerator
was leaking 
 dripping 
now  i wouldn t say
i m handy by any means 
mechanically retarded
would be closer to the truth 
but phil said it himself 
 if you wanna
fix something    
you have to take
everything apart   
davis      and figure out
what s important  
what ll make you stronger 
phil 
repairing the human heart
is like repairing
an automobile 
just examine everything 
then you can put it
all back together 
 panting 
davis 
put it all back together   
hmm 
 cell phone buzzing

claim to management 
in the meantime is

i shouldn t have called 
i    i m going to contact you

i m sorry again 
mister mitchell 
this is so unprofessional 
customer service
is a profession 
 hangs up 
 error tone sounds 
 error tone souwns 
 sighs 
some people
wallow through their grief 
my wife  she cooks 
this is delicious  margot 
what is it 
did julia tell you
what we were fighting about 
i bought her these bath towels
and she didn t like  em 
so she took  em back
without telling me 
and we hadn t spoken
for three days 
 cell phone buzzing 
davis  i m sorry 
excuse me 
hi  karen 
how did you know it was me 
i have you programmed
into my phone 
oh  i see  i m not sure
how i feel about that 
there s something else
i wanted to bring
to your attention
regarding your claim 
okay 
during our previous
conversation 
you implied that my job
wasn t a profession 
oh  well    i m sorry 
i didn t mean it as an insult 
i know  but it made me think 
and i concluded that
you might be right 
phil  god bless con ed 
and there was light 
yeah  i ve gotta go 
thank you for dinner 
really 
davis   moreno  means brown
in spanish  did you know that 
karen  yes  i did  of course 
do you have brown hair 
karen  no  it s blonde 
davis  are you
of spanish descent 
karen   no  why do you ask 
davis  i m just trying
to paint a mental picture 
 indistinct conversations 
excuse me 
is karen moreno here 
who 
blonde hair  hazel eyes 
but not hispanic like
her name suggests 
 cell phone buzzing 
hi  where are you 
karen  
i was there  in the diner 
i sat in a booth
for a few minutes 
i even played a song
on the little baby jukebox 
and then   
i dunno  i got sad  so i left 
oh 
what song did you play 
crazy on you  by heart 
that made you sad 
not so much the song 
how are your pancakes 
oh  i   
i m in the parking lot 
what 
you re a smoker

i have a prescription 
oh

sitting there in the window
eating pancakes

a shadowy figure
smoking pot in a corolla 
you know what  i should go 
yeah  yeah  i m gonna go 
no  no  no  wait  i have
another letter here for you 
put it in the mail 
steven 
i think it s for real  phil 
if their
second quarter earnings
are an indication of growth 
even just two
or three percent 
then it s a risk worth taking 
davis  do you need some paper 
is there something
you d like to
contribute to the discussion 
yes  actually 
but it s more of a question 
would any of you consider
crazy on you to be a sad song 
and that s from  you know 
assuming
that you re familiar with
the heart catalog 
 indistinct conversations 
let me go crazy
crazy on you
 elevator bell dings 
electronic voice  going down 
 crazy on you playing 
 davis humming in his head 
can i help you  hi

customer service issue

davis  dear karen  is it okay

now that we ve almost met 
i ll assume so

through my last year
ofcohege 
i had this guy edmond write
all my papers for me 
and sometimes 
i d give him ecstasy 
 both laughing 
you know   
davis  she was quiet 
but for some reason 
i wanted to tell her things 
i found myself
mapping her face as i talked 
somehow  she got me talking
about my wife 
i really let her in 
then  out of nowhere 
she asked   
so why d you marry her 
i dunno   cause it was easy 
yeah   
man on pa

davis  dear karen  fuck phil 
he called me
into his office   
i pulled the plug
on lightyear

gut feeling 
to be honest  yourjudgment
of late has been questionable 
well    how so  phil 
did you take apart
the lighting fixture
in our bathroom 
yes  i did 
and your computer 
i assume you re responsible
for the washroom stall 
that was my work  yes 
why 
well  that s a little
harder to answer 
mmm hmm  try me 
the bathroom stall 
for example 
the door was squeaking 
and it had probably been that
way for quite some time 
i just never noticed 
and now  i m noticing
all different kinds
of things  phil 
and i wanna see how they work 
like that clock 
pure craftsmanship  artistry 
that belonged to my
great grandmother  1890s 
i wanna rip it apart and
spread it out
all over the floor   chuckles 
and no offense to
your great grandmother 
but i see a clock like that 
and i wanna know
what it looks like inside 
phil  mmm 
davis 
mmm 
i want you to
take some time off 
davis  fuck him 
and the way he leans
on the corner of his desk
with his sleeves rolled up
like he s about
to dig a ditch 
 chuckles 
no more imaginary
office ditches  karen 
from now on 
it s me and my tools 
i intended to drive home
but accidentally turned
for the midtown tunnel 
ruby drive   
maybe there are no accidents

time to come and look for you 
automated voice

out together 
do you like girls 
idunno 
i think jennifer hymen s
pretty  she flirts with me

i can see the outline

or if i m just fixating 
jennifer hymen 
that s really her name

you know 
i mean you re young 
and you re curious  it s   
sometimes  i imagine
his dick in my mouth

uh  i would say that
you re probably gay
