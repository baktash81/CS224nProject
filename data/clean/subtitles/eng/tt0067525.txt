the entire los angeles area 
already hospitai facilities have begun
to crack under the strain    
    and civii defense authorities state the
situation is the same across the country 
martial law is now nationwide 
major cities in ali parts of the country  
new york  los angeles     
   report plague victims faliing dead
in the streets  in their homes  at work 
the first symptom appears to be
severe choking     
   foliowed by immediate unconsciousness 
death occurs within minutes 
whether a state of war
between china and russia stiil exists     
    is not important any ionger 
our feliow countrymen are dying

now the question is survival 
is this the end of technological man 
is this the conciusion of ail our yesterdays 
the boasts of our fabled science    
     the superhuman conquests
of space and time   the age of the wheel 
we were warned of judgment 
well   
     here it is  here   now     
   in the form of

    in a smaii grocery store     
    at 5500 block 
you d think the prices
wouid keep them in the supermarkets 
you gotta hand it to them 
they sure cover their tracks 
two years 
lf l couid just find the nest 
find out where they hole up 
hey 
matthias 
aii right  where s matthias 
come on  where s matthias 
where s the hive 
journai recording 958  august 5  1 977

one of matthias  group  dead of piague 
the sweep continues 
not my color 
wait  come back 
l want to taik to you 
hey 
ls this how it starts 
a trip to the iaughing academy 
no  you siily bastard 
lt starts with you
asking yourself idiot questions 
right 
okay 
let s get cleaned up     
    and find a drink before the bars close 
and  ail brothers and sisters 
l ask you to look at him 
does he have the marks 
do you see them 
no 
you see him as we were
before the punishment    
    before we gained grace 
you see iying there the iast of scientists 
of bankers  of businessmen     
    the users of the wheel 
yes 
do we use the tools
of the wheei as he does 
no 
 is he of the famiiy 
 no 
 is he of the sacred society 
 no 
 then what is he 
 evil 
he is part of the dead 
he has no place here 
he has the stink of oil
and electrical circuitry about him 
he is obsoiete 
you are discarded 
you are the refuse of the past 
you re fuli of crap 
how hard it is to admit the truth 
take him to the iittie room
for the questioning 
weli  mr  neviiie 
now we can talk a little whiie 
lt s been a long time since you ve talked 
except to yourseif 
tell me something  would you 
are you feiias reaily with
the lnternal revenue service 
your little jokes
are meaningless  mr  nevilie 
or doctor  or colonei 
whatever it was they cailed you 
 i m a scientist  what the heil are you 
 definition of a scientist 
a man who understood nothing 
untii there was nothing left to understand 
weli       
so there is a iittle light
in the forest after all 
a guiding light  mr  neviile 
but now to me
has passed the responsibiiity     
    for this last tiny remnant of mankind 
then why don t you quit
these bloody games 
throw away those halioween costumes
and get these peopie organized  damn it 
or are you aiready too far gone 
 along the road of truth 
 oh  for god s sake 
and we are very organized  mr  neville 
after iast night  you should know that 
lf you re organized 
why don t you try finding a cure 
there is none 
none 
there was no cure 
and there is no cure    
    but the famiiy has found its way 
we can bear it 
the oniy burden ieft is you 
but you ve been trying to kiii me
for two years 
last night you kilied how many 
three of us 
and today  we don t know yet 
you re the angei of death  doctor  not us 
he has confessed ali  brothers 
murder  use of forbidden tools 
practice of prescribed rites 
he admits science  medicine  weapons 
machinery  electricity 
he has not shared the punishments 
 he does not bear the marks 
 marks 
show him  my children 
show him the pretty marks 
these are the marks  mr  nevilie 
the punishment  which you
and those like you brought upon us 
ln the beginning we tried to heip
one another  those that were left 
we tried to ciean things up 
set things straight 
we buried things and burned 
then it came to me 
that we were chosen 
chosen for just this work 
to bury what was dead 
to burn what was evil    
    to destroy what was dangerous 
you re barbarians 
barbarians 
you cali us barbarian 
weli       
this is an honorabie name 
we mean to cancei the world
you civiiized people made 
we wili erase history from the time     
    that machinery and weapons
threatened more than they offered 
and when you die     
    the iast iiving reminder of heil
will be gone 
gone 
brother zachary

microbiological letters 
january  1 975  remember 
that s a nice recitation 
you know what it means 
l was a med school senior
when they scratched the worid 
as a matter of fact  l was gonna appiy
to biowar labs for my post doc     
      but the next term never came 
 i m sorry you didn t make it 
sorry the worid didn t make it 
 come on  let s go see about richie 
 richie 
lisa s brother  he iooks iike
he s about to go over 
you ve only seen the tertiary cases 
matthias and his peopie 
we re not that far gone 
but we re on the road 
the yeilow brick road 
we re off to see the wizard 
when it hit  the oider people either died
or went to the third stage fast     
    you know  blindness in light 
aibinism  psychotic iilusions     
    occasionai stages of torpor 
like matthias and the things out there 
 what about you  why didn t you get it 
 i don t know 
some of the younger peopie
have a kind of     
    resistance 
l don t know  we just hold out 
one or two of us are a bit light sensitive  
but otherwise we re aii right 
but richie s definitely going 
he s advanced secondary  lncidentaily     
    mind telling me
what keeps you in the city 
you some kind of     exterminator  huh 
l guess maybe you couid call it that 
very compiicated  doctor 
l d be iiving on top of city hali 
or better than that  the oxy tower    
    instead of that pillbox you re in 
weli  that s where l iive 
lt s where l used to live 
lt s where l m gonna iive 
and not matthias nor his famiiy     
    nor any other son of a bitch
is gonna make me ieave 
he s no better 
his fever is high 
 what are you doing   
 shut up 
keep out of the way 
sit down 
couid stay this way for weeks 
or he couid go over 1 0 minutes from now 
l ve seen them go before  
l almost got kilied by a friend of mine
last summer 
he went over without any warning 
when l looked away     
    his face was getting pale and his hair
was going  when l iooked back    
    he didn t have any eyes 
what did you do 
l did just like you d do  doctor 
l killed him 
lf the masonic rites are over     
    bow about richie 
we li take him to my piace 
l got neariy everything l need there 
ls there anything you can do  doctor 
l mean  seeing how you ve lost
over 200 miilion patients 
l don t have it 
 have what 
 the piague  l m immune 
 everybody has it 
 everybody but me 
there was a vaccine 
just an experimentai batch 
we weren t sure it d work 
 why  if you re immune  you couid  
 that s right 
my biood might be a serum 
at the stage that boy s in  my antibodies
could reverse the whoie process  stop it 
christ  you could save the worid 
screw the worid  let s save richie 
nothing with drugs 
lt s gotta be the serum 
couidn t you reconstitute the vaccine 
you got any idea
how many steps it takes     
    to synthesize an antibiotic
specific for this bug 
 got the picture 
 i ve tried  god knows i ve tried 
once i caught one
of matthias  peopie iast year     
     and tried everything
on the shelves on him 
he damn near killed me    
   and then he died very badly himseif 
so it s very tight  doctor 
very tight 
bring him in here 
ln the bed 
l see where you do your heavy thinking 
one side keeps the other side going 
can t have one without the other 
 i m a narcissist 
 how do you do 
 the guest room 
 you weren t expecting us 
l wasn t expecting you 
weli  hold these 
l m gonna need some heip 
lisa wiil have to do you 
l hate to ieave the kids aione too long 
they get spooked 
hey  watch your mouth 
you know  some of the kids 
you know what they say 
no  what do some of the kids say 
they say the family comes
in the night when it s dark 
they say they re going to come
some night and take richie s soui     
    and tie it aii up in a bag
and give it to the devil 
ls that realiy true 
do you know if that s reaily true 
no  we wouidn t let that happen 
not a chance 
are you god 
let s find out if he s even a doctor first
before we go promoting him  okay 
okay 
how about a break 
weli 
your move 
l just made my move 
where d you get that dress 
the same place you got that jacket 
l hustled it 
the house fuzz was on vacation 
neviile 
his voice 
l il never get used to it     
    to hearing it 
something      
we were with them for a while 
you know 
with matthias 
you were a part of that family 
when it happened 
when even the army feli apart     
    and there was nobody left
except those iiving aione like animais     
    matthias waiked the streets at night     
    ringing a beil 
richie and l  we had us a piace
in the back of a furniture store  
one day  we hear this beli 
so we go out to see 
and there are peopie there 
we thought we were alone     
    just me and richie
with miliions of corpses 
but there was matthias and other peopie 
weli  anyway 
he gave us the famiiy for a whiie 
we helped with the buriais 
we helped with the burnings 
but when it was over 
and the worst was past     
    they began to know
how different we were  our skin  our eyes 
one day whiie they were asieep 
we just took off 
how d you get mixed up
with dutch and his group 
dutch came by one day
and said he was with the census bureau 
 now  what you thinking 
 yeah 
weli  you know the oid song 
 lf you were the only girl in the world
and l were the only boy   okay     
    but until then don t bother me 
l guess l m the oniy boy 
the famiiy 
god  l forgot to keep the fuei up
in the generator 
they ll be into the garage 
you stay here 
 what s this for 
 comfort 
you may not have time  brother zachary 
more time than neville has  brother 
 when he comes back up  l il be waiting 
 take care 
 he has the luck of a devii 
 i know 
but this time his luck has run out 
robert 
you can take down
that service fiag now  mother 
man  don t scare me iike that 
 you ali right 
 yeah 
yeah  l m okay 
now  what s this stuff about me being
the oniy girl in the worid 
do you know it s been a long  iong time 
l m not sure i remember how this goes 
 how is he 
 he s stable 
no loss of pigment since yesterday
and vitai signs are steady 
he s comfortabie 
l m sorry 
lt s been a long  long time
since l ve had a patient 
weli  doctor  you certainly haven t iost
your bedside manner 
ls that so 
are you ready for this 
what is it 
birth controi piiis 
yeah 
here we are 
l can make toxins from both of these 
aii right  now the tourniquet 
good and tight 
that s fine 
give me the swab 
aii right  you get the needle 
go ahead 
aii right  take off the tourniquet 
wili one bottie be enough 
lt s genuine  1 60 proof
oid anglo saxon  baby 
l was a very pecuiiar doctor
in those days     
    trying to find treatments
for diseases that hadn t existed     
    tili other doctors invented them 
now l m the only game in town 
l don t know how much 
l il draw biood as often as l can 
we li just have to keep
pumping it into him 
 how iong do you think it li take 
 i don t know 
l reaiiy don t know 
but if it does work     
    then richie wili be the source
of even more antibodies 
the more peopie we inject     
    the more serum we ii get 
and when that s done       
when that s done  baby  we wili puli out 
we li take what we need
and head for the mountains 
out of rats  ailey
where the dead men lost their bones
t s   eliot turns out to have been
just as good a prophet as he was a poet 
 the waste land  
l wonder if it comforts him 
l wonder if i ii ever see
a stream fuil of fish again 
where d you ever see
a stream fuil of fish in harlem 
at the movies 
 does that hurt 
 a little  yeah 
lt hurts  how about off  man  turn it off 
a week ago  that much iight
wouid have sent you right up the wall 
l m beginning to see the light 
l il have another batch of serum ready
in a few hours     
    then we li load up that land rover 
pick up dutch and the kids     
    and go to the hills 
how about the sierras 
yeah  oh  robert 
baby  we made it  we reaiiy made it 
l think l li go pick up
some stuff for the trip 
ls there anything special
you fancy  baby 
what l pick up today  you re gonna
be seeing for a iong  long time 
 why don t you skip it 
 oh  honey 
the most dangerous thing l ever ran into
in one of those stores was you 
you watch yourself 
you stay on the ground fioors 
near the doors and in the iight 
 if you see anything  shoot 
 check 
honey  can l borrow your credit cards 
ls that gonna be for me 
no  you don t need any more 
this is for lisa 
 one of these days  she may  
 start to turn 
that s always a possibility 
lt s best to catch these things early 
then you don t think
the serum would work   
    for tertiary cases 
 what do you mean 
 like matthias 
the famiiy 
lt s hard to say 
weli  wouid it 
come on  help me with this 
put the cap on that 
put it in the refrigerator 
l can t afford to give more biood
tili l get clear of this town 
later on  if your biood count comes up     
    and you put on some weight 
we can use your biood to make serum 
yeah 
yeah  now  go eat your soup 
you know  someone ought to do
something about those people 
how about it 
 you gonna give them the serum 
 fat chance 
how come
