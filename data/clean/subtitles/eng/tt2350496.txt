thank you for sending

i had made that food
for my husband

the heart is really through the stomach 
in return for those hours 
i am sending you paneer 
my husband s favorite 
ila 
auntie  this letter
business is strange 
ila  you owe a thank you

no  keep it short 
auntie 
auntie

auntie 
the lunchbox has come back

  a reply 
  yes 
what does it say 
and it s not in
rajeev s handwriting 
read it 
uh     dear  ila  the food

what else does it say 
 dear  ila  the food
was very salty today  
what  no  thank you   no  hello  
 dear ila  the food was
very salty today  
who does he think he is 
he empties the lunchbox
and then complains 
wait a minute 
here  use this 
no  i don t like all this 
i ll tell the delivery man the box
is going to the wrong address 
he should ve thanked you 
no  i really don t like this 
why  it s not like you know him 
good afternoon  sir  how are you 
good 
i couldn t find you at
your desk  so i came here 
you were reading in the canteen 
so i didn t want to disturb 
your lunchbox has an amazing aroma 
i could taste the food
without eating it 
your wife  sir 
she has magic in her hands 
my wife is dead 
dear ila  the salt was fine today 
the chili was a bit
on the higher side 
but i had two bananas after lunch 
they helped to extinguish
the fire in my mouth 
and i think it ll also
be good for the motions 
there are so many people in this city
who eat only a banana or two for lunch 
it s cheap and it fills you up 
hello 
my husband came home
late last night 
he didn t say a word 
this morning he went to work 
my daughter went to school 
and i started cooking
with deshpande auntie 
she lives in the flat above us 
her husband has been in a
coma for the last 15 years 
one day he woke up and started
staring at the ceiling fan 
since then he does just that 
he stares at the fan all day
and falls asleep at night 
in the morning he wakes up
and stares at the fan again 
he doesn t say anything 
this has been going
on for 15 years 
even the doctors
have lost hope now 
it s an old  orient  model fan 
it is never switched off 
auntie thinks that the
fan keeps him alive 
one day the power went off 
and so did the fan 
uncle s heartbeat slowed 
luckily the power came back on 
after that  deshpande auntie
had a generator installed 
deshpande uncle stares at the fan 
my husband stares at his phone 
as if nothing else exists 
maybe nothing else does   
what do we live for 
madam 
dear ila  your husband
sounds like a busy man 
life is very busy these days 
there are too many people  and
everyone wants what the other has 
years ago  you could find a place to
sit in the train every now and then 
but these days  it s difficult 
if mr  deshpande wakes up now 
he will see the difference and probably
go back to his orient ceiling fan 
when my wife died  she got
a horizontal burial plot 
i tried to buy a burial plot
for myself the other day 
and what they offered
me was a vertical one 
i ve spent my whole life
standing in trains and buses 
now i ll have to stand
even when i m dead 
why don t you have another child 
sometimes having a child
can help a marriage 
rajeev 
how is this 
it s nice 
you forgot 
the last time i wore this
was for our honeymoon 
i thought i d try it today and
see if it needed altering 
but look  it fits perfectly 
  doesn t it 
  yes 
in fact  it s loose 
yes  it looks good 
after our honeymoon  we had no
idea that yashvi was on the way 
we didn t find out for a while 
we didn t find out for two months 
we didn t have much then 
mm 
when she arrived  our luck turned 
these days things are so
expensive  luck is not enough 
and why do you make
cauliflower every day 
did you buy it in bulk 
rajeev 
mm hm 
what if yashvi had a
little brother or sister 
you had a brother 
and he   
please don t make cauliflower
every day  it gives me gas 
hm 
rickshaw  bus  airplane   
everything gets stuck
in mumbai traffic 
this road has been
jammed for hours

that tall tower 
a woman jumped off along with
her little girl this morning 
jumped with her little girl 
yes  she jumped 
what was her name 
how would i know  sir 
i m not related to her

husband went to work

this morning  my husband went
to work and yashvi to school 
i switched on the
radio  the news was on 
when my brother died 
everyone said the same thing 
 he should have had courage 
so what if he failed his exams 
he should have had courage  
what went through
that woman s mind 
perhaps she took off
all her jewelry 
bracelets  earrings 
her wedding necklace 
what did her daughter
ask on the way 
mom  what are we going to play 
it must have been so
difficult to get to the roof 
doesn t it take courage to
jump from tall buildings 
dear ila  please don t
think like that 
things are never as
bad as they seem 
one day i was on the
train on my way to work 
and then suddenly i felt something 
someone touching me 
down there 
are you laughing 
yes  auntie 
i just remembered a joke

you were walking and kicked a cat 
it got hit by a bus 
and you just went on your
way  didn t even look back

hello 
my husband came
home late last night 
he got a call and
went back to work 
yashvi fell asleep 
when i got married  i took some
things without telling my mother 
among those things i
found an old diary 
grandma wrote all her recipes in it 
i found one for spring apples 
spring apples are in season

it s great 
just great  sir  book a
lunchbox for me as well 
it s shutting down soon 
but it has such great food 
there s no value for
talent in this country 
you re right  sir  talent has
no value in this country 
you need magic in the hands 
anyone can make food
but you need magic 
dear ila  your grandmother s
recipe was very good 
even better than my
favorite aubergines 
yesterday even i found
something from many years ago 
i found old tv shows that
my wife used to record 
you must have been a child when they
played on tv  or not even born yet 
my wife used to love them 
i don t know why i
wanted to see them 
i watched them for hours 
i went through them show by
show  episode by episode 
and then finally  after
staying up all night 
i realized what it was
that i was looking for 
every sunday when she
watched the shows 
i was outside repairing my
bicycle or just smoking 
andi would glance through the window
every now and then just for a second 
and i would see her
reflection on the tv screen 
laughing 
laughing at the same
jokes over and over 
each time as if she was hearing
it for the very first time 
i wish i had kept on
looking back then 
i sent all the pay orders  sir 
an apple and a banana for you 
okay  have 
no  sir 
no  have 
have 
okay  sir 
  what is this 
  sir  uh  paper 
could i have some water please 
  how is it  good 
  mm  i love this 
yeah  thank you 
nowadays everyone
uses e mail  not paper 
  what paper 
  the letter 
we are in the era of e mail 
hello 
my mother loves the old tv shows 
when i was little i would watch
them with her for hours 
i wanted to tell you something 
every cigarette takes five
minutes off your life 
my father has lung cancer 
when the pain is too much 
he says he should have smoked more
to avoid going through all this 
don t mind 
oh  ila 
yes  auntie 
did you get my carrots 
yes  here they are 
here 
they only cost 10 rupees 
what else did you get 
the usual things  auntie 
what s the other name
for  aubergine  
 eggplant  
it s vegetarian  so how come
it has  egg  in its name 
he s on new medicine these days 
it helps 
but he sleeps all day 
ma  where is the tv 
there are no good programs
on tv these days 
do you need some money 
we re doing okay  child 
this new medicine
seems very expensive 
don t worry  i ll handle it 
how 
where will you get the money 
if my son were alive  i wouldn t
have to ask anyone for money 
  i ll talk to rajeev 
  no  no  there is no need 
i ll arrange for
about 5 000 for now 
we re the girl s side 
does it look nice  asking
for money all the time 
it s fine  you can
pay it back slowly 
no 
i have some money 
i can handle it 
okay  fine 
but don t tell your father 
the 5 000 should cover
the cost of the medicine
for this month 
next month something will turn up 
do you want to see him 
shall i wake him 
it s late  we should go home 
okay 
dear ila  you won t believe
what happened to me yesterday 
in the evening  as i was walking
to the station with shaikh   
shaikh and i  we work together 
i felt like stopping to
look at a painter s works 
all his paintings are
exactly the same 
but when you look
close  real close 
you can see that they are different 
each slightly different from the other 
a different car here  a different
man daydreaming on the bus there 
a stray dog gallantly
crossing the street 
whatever catches the
painter s fancy on that day 
and in one of them  i saw myself 
at least i think it s me 
and then i treated myself
to an auto rickshaw 
the old houses of boys i used to play
with when i was a child are gone now 
my old school too 
but some things are still the same 
the old post office    still there 
and the hospital where i was born and
where my parents died  and my wife 
i think we forget things if we
have no one to tell them to 
did you say something  sir 
what 
did you say something 
no 
what are you playing 
blind man s bluff 
can i tell you what
we used to play 
what 
look 
let s untie this first 
should i do it 
i ll do it 
we used to play house 
  ah uh 
  mm 
this was the baby 
i was the father 
and your uncle used
to play the mother 
my wife 
hello 
i want to tell you something 
my husband is having an affair 
i thought i should confront him 
but i don t have the courage 
where would i go 
there is one place 
my daughter learned in school
that in bhutan everyone is happy 
they don t have gross domestic product 
only gross national happiness 
what if we had that here 
madam 
you look very
distracted today  sir 
  did i do anything wrong 
  no 
tell me something  shaikh 
yes  sir 
have you ever been to bhutan 
bhutan 
i was thinking instead of nasik 
i could settle in bhutan 
i ve only been to saudi 
bhutan is good as well 
the economy is down there 
one rupee here is five there 
so one can go there 
my mother always used to say   
always says 
 sometimes the wrong train will
get you to the right station  
your mother says 
but you told me you were an orphan 
i am  sir 
but when i say  my mother always
says  people take it more seriously 
and it feels good 
right 
you are listening
to radio bhutan   
how can we go to bhutan together 
i don t even know your name 
how are you  sir 
a banana and apple 
here  try this 
here  taste this 
you are glowing today  sir 
what is it 
you look 10 years younger 
your mother says 
 the wrong train will get
you to the right station  
mother is always right  sir 
  how is it 
  i love this 
  variety 
  variety  sir 
auntie 
auntie 
yes  what 
auntie   
do you have a tape of
that movie saajan 
yes  why 
the songs were good  right 
they re okay 
could we listen to it 
now 
yes 
can you play it 
i ll play it 
hello 
yesterday  auntie played this tape
of the movie saajan 
a strange coincidence 
she has every hindi
movie audio tape 
she doesn t have a
cd or mp3 player 
she keeps the cassette
industry alive all by herself 
you must be trying to figure out
what i scratched out 
isn t it odd to keep
writing like this 
we can write anything in a
letter  it s very easy 
but this 
i can tell you only in person 
i think it s time for us to meet 
do you know the kooler café
in matunga 
i ve heard they have
very good kheema pao 
my favorite 
shall we meet tomorrow

yes  i ll come after lunch 
it s urgent 
okay  i ll come

i just had a meeting with
the accounts department 
and it was the most embarrassing
meeting of my life 
you know what they said 
they said   it s as if our claims
department does not exist  
all the pay orders are wrong 
shaikh s initials are
all over the place 
and to think that i was going
to have this man replace you 
i need you to review this 
stay up all night if
necessary  but fix it 
and as for you  shaikh  just
get out of my sight  please 
it s my mistake  sir 
i made the pay orders 
i asked his initials
because we work together 
it s my mistake 
fernandes 
  you don t have to defend him 
  i m not defending anyone  sir 
thirty five years of service 
and you have not made
one single mistake 
you know i would not
defend anyone  sir 
anyway

accounts department

and i deserve that 
yesterday you waited in the
restaurant for me for a long time 
but before that  that same morning
i forgot something in the bathroom 
i went back in to get it 
and the bathroom smelled the same 
exactly the same as it used to be after
my grandfather had been in the shower 
it was like my grandfather
had been there 
but he had not 
it was just me

of an old man

lulled me with its motions 
i kept rocking back and forth as it
threw me left and threw me right 
and then before i knew it
