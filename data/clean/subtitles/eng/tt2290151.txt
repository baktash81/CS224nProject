resulted records
lost passion perhaps
thats started
really hate hippie shit

saw hippies mainly getting high
lets lets get high ball
gave life rock roll music
taken away
getting old enough really enjoy

lord ive trying
legendary status among musicians sure
people say big star
era thing band thing
think time
alone theyre big star
thats one bands like go big star
dont go big star ilk
ive listened records many many occasions
ive never sing
see lot time spent making records
know things beauty
difficult find weak moment
arent
wont let walk home school
makes perfect sense artist shadows
thats stuff people actually want go hear
big star joined club
theyve made three records
theres different line album
different kind approach
thing holds band together
suppose trying express something melancholic
something exuberant kind two extremes
cool jerk
oh want
like kangaroo
well theres two separate dreams
always head
dream really putting best record could
like wanted versus dream
would commercially successful
thought former dream lot
ever thought dream
see sadness eyes
said art create sense
time stopped
big star transcended normal escapist pop convention
creating music somehow froze moments
concurrently vibrant yet startlingly brilliant
yet oddly spent
mother died home
brotherinlaw noticed people
front yard
taking pictures house
said new york
fans chris bell
knocked us
personal relationship band
especially band doesnt become big commercially
trying something shooting moon
certain kind purity terms music going sound like
idea think levels
individual
memphis
unrecoupable never really recouped
nevertheless changed music
waiting like little jewel earth
dig find
appreciate retrospectively
great gift recorded music
personal viewpoint big star story
pain transformed beauty
everybody suffered everybody feels pain
everybody turns kind art
really harkened back real
authentic pain real authentic loneliness
things would become alternative music
years later
never gave damn us
never gave hand us
im sure belonged
maybe thats wasnt surprised
big star wasnt commercially successful
seems belong
september gurls much
