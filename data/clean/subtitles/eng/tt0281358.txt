i can t believe you were in jail 
 what d you tell them 
 it was a nice night for a drive 
ended up at the cement factory

figured i d leave before
they thought i was involved 
gotta hand it to you 
you re a jedi master of bullshit 
damn  that jamie sullivan

a little maintenance 
she might not look bad 
nice sweater 
thank you 
thank you 
a student claims you were drinking
on school property 
lucky for you 
clay gephardt isn t talking 
the factory owners aren t pressing
charges  at least not today 
i said i d arrange
appropriate punishment 
what  are you gonna expel me 
not yet 
besides attending class  you will help
our janitorial staff after school 
 for pay 
 for the inner satisfaction it brings 
saturdays  you ll tutor students
at our sister school 
you ll take part
in the drama club s final event 
the spring play 
it s time you experienced
other things 
started spending time
with other kinds of people 
don t blow it  landon 
this is a device made of plastic wrap 
a coat hanger and wite out 
 does anyone know what it is 
 it s a star frame 
this is a star frame 
it will help you locate stars
with your naked eye 
mercury and jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset 
bet you can see angels up there 
flying around 
there are things that
could be called miraculous 
the more einstein studied the universe 
the more he believed in a higher power 
well  if there is a higher power   
   why can t he get you a new sweater 
he s too busy looking for your brain 
laugh  it s a joke 
 let s get out of here

do you wanna buy some raffle tickets 
i m trying to raise money
to buy jefferson new computers 
no 
so i saw you in there with luis 
and i know it can be difficult   
   but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else 
are you gonna go visit clay gephardt 
that would be a no 
they moved him from the hospital
to a rehab place 
is this your idea of small talk 
if so  your social skills need work 
no one made him jump 
 it s called peer pressure 
 how do you know 
you read it in your precious book 
please don t pretend
like you know me  okay 
but i do  i do 
we have all the same classes
since kindergarten 
why  you re jamie sullivan 
you sit at lunch table seven 
it s not the reject table  but it s
definitely self exile territory 
you have exactly one sweater 
you look at your feet when you walk 
and for fun  you tutor on weekends   
   and hang out
with the stars and planets kids 
how s that sound 
fairly predictable 
nothing i haven t heard before 
 you don t care what people think 
 no 
i don t know what your problem is 
miss garber has nice hooters 
this is bullshit  thanks 
i can t wait to see you in stage

 that s thoroughly predictable 
 your act only works on an audience

 thank you 
forty two 
what do you mean  forty two 
forty two is befriend somebody
i don t like 
it s a to do list i have for my life

get a tattoo 
what s number one 
i d tell you 
but then i d have to kill you 
i ve come   
   to see if you re ready 
take a good look  the only thing
i m ready for is a dirt nap 
ready to look into your heart 
tom thornton 
your words have been heard 
and not just by me 
when you walked into

 landon carter s asking me for help 
 yeah 
okay  i ll pray for you 
jamie  look  
you ve obviously never asked anybody
for help before  right 
a request like yours requires
flattery and groveling 
it can t be about you 
it has to be for the common good 
it is for the common good 
eddie zimmerhoff deserves the best 
 please 
 okay  one condition  though 
what s that 
you have to promise
you won t fall in love with me 
 that s not a problem 
 okay  i ll see you today after school 
landon carter is coming here

my time and my life 
it s him i don t trust  not you 
you gonna keep me out here

we could run lines together 
okay  but just not
so anybody knows  right 
i just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good i get 
we could be secret friends 
exactly  it s like
you re reading my mind 
great  maybe you could read mine 
jamie  i can t just be your friend 
landon  i thought i saw something
in you  something good 
but i was very wrong 
damn it 
sorry  sorry 
you know the answer 
come on  man  i know you know 
okay  it s you  me and the basket 
we form the three corners
of a triangle 
take a step towards the basket

jamie 
 you ve no idea how to be a friend 
 i don t just want that 
 you don t know what you want 
 you re scared someone wants you 
 why would that scare me 
 you couldn t hide behind books   
   or your fricking telescope 
or your faith 
no  you know the real reason
why you re scared 
it s because you want
to be with me too
