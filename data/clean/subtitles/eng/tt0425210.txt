there was a time
you misunderstood
i wasnt asking for the time
i was just saying there was a time
there was a time
mmhm
take brown sugar back there for example
shes pretty fucking foxy right
shes 70
if shes a day
but there was a time
i dont follow
the names smith im from out of town
listen mr smith
just smith
the reason im in town
in case youre wondering
is because of a kansas city shuffle
whats a kansas city shuffle
kansas city shuffle is
when everybody looks right and you go left
never heard of it
hm
its not something people hear about
falls on deaf ears mostly
but this particular ones
been over 20 years in the making
20 years huh
no small matter
requires a lot of planning
it involves a lot of people
people connected only
by the slightest of events
like whispers in the night
in that place that never forgets
even when those people do
it all starts with a horse
its what they called back then
a drugstore handicap
a guy wants what the fella calls a sure thing
so he schemes to make it so
he calls in the doc a nobbler from antwerp
known for his savvy but not for his discretion
woma n oh fuck me baby fuck me baby
the same could be said
for docs jelly on the side  gloria
almost there almost there
oh god oh god
hey which horse did you say
it was again baby
which brings us to abe because gloria
was too much jelly for one outfit
hey baby is your wife around
what do you want
woma n who is it abe
ah its seymour
gloria sure tell that bitch to open her eyes
maybe then shed see more
seymour says hello
what are you doing calling me here
christmas came early this year baby
i got a present for you
remember my friend doc
smith now abe wasnt a nosy fella
but he had a nose
and right below his nose was his mouth
abe do you remember gloria the hooker
well glorias got this friend doc
whos got a line on a dopedup racehorse
the fix is in at aqueduct
seventh horse tenth race
doped up
smith
and then there was this joker who had ears
abe lets get back
smith  who looked like somebodys uncle
max whos your favorite uncle
ok whos your second favorite uncle
just pay attention
i got something here
smith and before you know it
folks are getting a big dose of the gimmies
and men start talking their hats off
and that manischewitz grapevine wine spills in
your ear and tells you you got a sure thing
and whats worse is you start to believe it
at least thats how it went with old max
who wasnt so much old as he was tired
tired of being a dog without a day
tired of waking up and finding
that his dreams were only dreams
were leaving
but mostly
max was tired of not having a front lawn
make sure he doesnt come home late
i will
i was talking to your son
giggles
you think thats funny do you
uhhuh bye mom
yeah bye mom
love you
tannoy theyre off

shea stadium

mets v phillies
good man give me the postgame
stallard gave up six runs in the first five innings
ed kranepool hit a line drive down right field
but it hit the wall fouled by a foot
gonder hit a groundball
between first and second
but hes so slow second baseman
tony taylor tagged him out at first
did you get all that from the radio
mm hm
youre good
ok ill be right back
no no no youve got to stay in the car
why
because they dont let little boys inside the track
sauls dad takes him to the track
well sauls dad is a degenerate gambler
and if youre the son of a degenerate gambler
they let you in
its economically viable
are you going to be a degenerate gambler
hey you know better than that
your old mans smart
he only plays a sure thing
look
this moneys gonna get you through harvard
and youre gonna be a doctor
but until then
youve got to stay in the car
hey
next weekend you and me go to a ballgame
ok
ok
i love you kid
i love you too dad
wait watch watch watch watch
i almost forgot 15 minutes
start counting
tannoy
the next race at the aqueduct is the tenth race
come on come on
tannoy the field is making towards
the final turn and number seven has moved
into fifth position on the outside
number two has the lead
cheering
come on
number one is against the rail
and number seven is beginning
to pick up the pace on the outside
yes
yes come on baby come on
lets go
cheering intensifies
to challenge goes clear
and number seven takes the lead
its number seven who now has the lead
its strolling clear
yes
oh
number seven has fallen
number one comes home
and takes the lead to win it
smith max woke up to find his dreams
had just been the stuff of pipes
i want to place a bet
how much
20 large
oh you must feel real lucky
ill take your bet
and lay it off
ive got a bookies bookie
ill give you 21 on the horse
uhuh the racing form says 91
so you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand
and you get 91 if the spread sticks
you come in here with your pockets turned out
you get 21
the juice is ten
that means if you lose youre all in for 22 grand
20 for the bet two for the juice
can you pay these monies huh can you
yeah
just to be clear
if you lose
youre gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to
henry
henry
henry
henry
hey buddy you got a light
no henry
in that case how about the 20 gs
you just blew on the seven horse
what have you done with my son
hes on his way home just like you
urgh
where am i
roth hell tell you everything i swear
he already has
please
i have a family
please
please
wheres my boy
henry
where are they
henry
henry
fuck
shit
jesus
fuck shit jesus is right
i dont understand
why did they kill maxs family
new outfit in town
they didnt want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them
trying to make an impression
thats a fucking story man
charlie chaplin entered a charlie chaplin
lookalike contest in monte carlo
and came in third
now thats a story
this
this is something else
so thats a kansas city shuffle
no
its just the inciting incident
the catalyst
this  is a kansas city shuffle
they look right
and you
go left
sorry about that son
sometimes theres more to life than just living
besides you cant have a kansas city shuffle
without a body
hes down
get the roof
up there
im coming
coming
it took you long enough
youre not nick
youre not as tall as i thought youd be
well im short for my height
that makes sense because i can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock
you have a deceptively tall knock
congratulations
so its a good thing
i open the door expecting you to be up here
youre down here
that combined with a low centre of gravity
forget about it
who are you
im slevin
and what happened to your nose
i was using it to break some guys fist
somebody hit you
yeah i was kind of expecting it though
you were kind of expecting it
well they say bad things happen in threes
first i lost my job
then i came home to find
my apartment building had been condemned
due to a hybrid breed
of ecuadorian super termites
so i went to my girlfriend kellys
i had a key so i let myself in
hey dont stop on my account
oh shit
slevin
it was an accident
what like he tripped and you fell
ma n slevin do you know what time it is
im at the airport
are you sure you want me to come out
yeah two weeks in new york
and the only kelly youll remember
is the kelly who gave you your first hand job
on the bus to summer camp
kelly perkins said her hands were dry
and she needed
she said that to a lot of guys
thats why we called her jerkins perkins
just call me when you land all right
yeah
yeah i just got into town nick
im on my way over to your place
say man you got the time
ya man its uh 723
so youre probably still asleep
yo you got a smoke
no i dont smoke man
why dont you just go ahead and give me
your wallet and ill buy my own smokes
am i being mugged
man
and so here i am
you said three
what
you said bad things happen in threes
you lost your job your apartment was
condemned kelly was cheating on you
and you got mugged  that makes four
when youre on a roll youre on a roll
interesting although i would add
not the ever so clever holdup man
one hears so much about
well he did break my nose
but overlooked your suitcase
maybe it wouldnt make for a speedy getaway
true but then theres the matter of your watch
pretty fancy
its a fake
but he didnt know that
maybe he didnt see it
he saw it he asked you for the time
you say this was your third mugging
uh i travel a lot
wheres nick
i dont know he was supposed to
meet me here he never showed up
how did you get in
door was open
door was open
yeah
open or unlocked
i dont remember
you said open
could have been what was your name again
lindsey i live across the hall
oh
i came over to borrow a cup of sugar
wheres your cup
i came to borrow a cup of sugar
if i had a cup id have come to borrow sugar
touch√©
phone rings
maybe thats nick its right there
hello
hello
they hung up
i have an idea have you used the phone
since youve been here
no except for that
sorry wrong number
that was the hotel cheval
what are you doing
we know who he called who called him
columbo says three things
columbo
yeah columbo was this tv detective
played by peter falk
i know who columbo is yeah
he looked for three things at a crime scene
whats there now that wasnt before
what was there before that isnt now
and whats been moved
is this a crime scene
i think nicks in trouble
ah
sorry wrong number
that was the hotel cheval again
so what he called the hotel
the hotel called him back makes sense
so maybe its a clue
a clue to what
a clue to what happened to nick
we dont know anything did
we dont know anything didnt
youre here hes not the door was open
bad things happen where you
shit ive got to stop by work
just for a couple of hours ill come back
then we can start the investigation
the investigation
uhhuh itll be fun
ok
i totally forgot
yeah
sorry
may i borrow a cup of sugar
what
i never gave it much thought
until i put up a fresh pot of coffee
i was on my way to the store
and i thought nickd have sugar
you tell me your story i leave sugarless
i come back you put your penis on exhibition
although the coffees probably gone bad
by now i insist on following through
its like a norman rockwell painting
what my penis
no no the sugar
neighbors borrowing sugar from one another
its very um andy griffith
yeah
thats andy griffith
the penis thing is not very mayberry
no
thanks for the sugar sugar
i wanted to try and catch the next show

the boss
whos the boss
the guy we work for
jesus
come here and sit your punk ass down

im not the guy youre looking for
i dont live here
well you look like the guy that lives here

im just visiting i just got in this morning
the cat im looking for his name is uh
his name is nick man
nick
the cats name is nick now

so he can bump it off down the road
hey listen motherfucker
yo i got this
slow slow slow slow your roll man

all i know is
the boss slides me this here address
and he says sloe  thats him
elvis  thats me

who resides at this here address
now he told me that today
you just so happen to be here today
so i guess you the cat im supposed to pick up
today
but im not nick
yeah well unfortunately for you
youre not the first cat to tell me
you wasnt the guy i was looking for
you can ask lindsey she lives across the hall
she lives here
hold on man i aint asking nobody nothing
nick slevin clark kent
whatever your name is
the virgin mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass
titties hanging out and everything
if she told me your name was jesus christ i
still gotta take you to see the boss know why
no
orders
now you do know what orders is right
orders is orders
so i guess noone ever taught you not to use
the word youre defining in the definition
say something else i will break
your motherfucking nose i aint playing
my nose is already broken
can i just say one more thing
what
can you turn the heat up in here
cos its really cold
uh yeah
yyou you should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip
slevin ah jeez sighs
its cold out there
lets hurry it up man
yo grab his ass
the boss is right up there chump
well listen
your boys elvis and sloe
picked up the wrong guy
im not nick fisher
mr fisher
are you familiar with the shmoo mr fisher
a comic strip i liked as a boy
the shmoo was a loveable creature really
laid eggs
gave milk
and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger
the shmoo loved to be eaten
it could taste like any food you desire
shmoo hide cut thin made fine leather
even shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks
in essence the shmoo supplied
all of the worlds wants
i only bring up the shmoo because its relevant
to you and why you were brought here
im sorry who are you
im the boss
i thought he was the boss
why
do we look alike
so mr fisher
you were gonna tell me something
i dont know you brought me here
yes i did
back when you thought i was him
i never thought you were him
i thought he was you
i was trying to tell him you
that they picked up the wrong guy
wrong guy for what
what you wanted to see me about
know what i wanted to see you about
no
then how do you know i have the wrong guy
because im not
maybe i wanted to give you 96000
in that case do i still have the wrong guy
do you want to give me 96000
no do you want to give me 96000
no should i
i dont know should you
i dont know should i
long story short
i think were well past that point
ill bet it was that mouth that got you that nose
ok im under the impression that youre
under the impression that i owe you 96000
no you owe slim hopkins 96000
you owe slim slim owes me
you owe me
well in that case is slim around
hey slim do you know this cat
slim
no use
ever since somebody shot him
old slim went deaf
what happened to make slim go deaf
why
because i owe you 96000 and i might have
a slight problem coming up with the money
oh ok
well why dont we just make it an even 90
i may have exaggerated the slightness
hm
well why dont i just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favor
well that depends on the favor
the boss that was my son
notice how i said was
yeah
thats because hes dead
murdered
relegated to the past tense
sent from an is to a was
before hed had his breakfast
bummer
lex talionis
the law of retaliation
a pact was broken
my son was murdered
so the rabbis son must share the same fate
whose son
the rabbis
why do they call him the rabbi
because
because hes a rabbi
whos his son
yitzchok
yitzchok yitzchok and the rabbi
yitzchok the fairy
why do they call him the fairy
because hes a fairy
he has wings can fly
sprinkles magic dust all over the place
hes homosexual
right
come on
so how does the rabbi feel about that
he doesnt know
you know but he doesnt
everybody knows
except the rabbi
thats right
so where do i fit in
you
youre the trigger man
me
you
arent there professionals
people you can hire to do this sort of thing
of course there are
yes
but you owe me 96000
why should i go out and pay someone else
when ive already paid you
hm sorry kid
but your money just isnt long enough
which means youre in my pocket
which means
if you dont do what i want you to do
youre gonna go from my pocket to my fridge
slim could use the company
i could use the shmoo
so ill expect your answer by morning
is there anything else
well i dont suppose i have to say anything
as trite and clich√©d as
go to the police and youre a dead man
i think you just did
i guess i did
so let me see if ive got this right
im paying you a lot of money to kill somebody
and youre getting somebody else to do it
dont worry
im gonna kill somebody
better call brikowski
tell him theres a new face in town
hey
nick still hasnt shown huh
no
whats with you and that towel
oh lindsey
its a very long story
get dressed and tell me about it on the way
where are we going
all we know is that somebody called nick
from the hotel cheval
i spoke to a friend who works there
they keep a record of every call made
she can access the computer and we can
find out what room the call came from
what is it
i know this guy
who
this guy
you know that guy
yeah i met him
he was dead
you met a dead guy
yeah
in a walkin freezer
bookmaker slim hopkins reported missing
police have no leads
blah blah blah yada yada
a spokesperson commented off the record
ironic that hopkins should go missing
considering hes allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself
i think its time you told me that story
about why youre still wearing that towel
do you mind if i get dressed first
phone rings
could be my friend from the hotel be right back
hm
hey lindsey i dont think its such a good idea
that we continue to
put your shoes on schlomo wants to see you
i dont know anyone named schlomo
someone named schlomo knows you
that is your only concern
lets go
like i said i dont know
aaahh better
i think its better if you let me do the talking
you think
what is it
hes sorry that he hit you
do you always speak for him
yes
hm
so hes a mute then
not quite
well what then
its personal youll have to ask him
hm how would he tell me
he wouldnt
hey are we going to the
no
but hes right there
a different outfit entirely
right across the street from one another
at one time they were one with one another
and then they tried to kill one another
and now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation
for fear of what the other man will do to him
let me guess all the way up
penthouse
gentle piano music
you must be mr fisher
must i because that hasnt been
working out for me lately
but im afraid you must
well if i must
do you know for what reason
youve been brought here
for starters im unlucky
the unlucky are nothing more than
a frame of reference for the lucky mr fisher
you are unlucky so i may know that i am not
unfortunately the lucky never realize
they are lucky until its too late
take yourself for instance yesterday
you were better off than you are today
but it took today for you to realize it but
today has arrived and its too late you see
people are never happy with what they have
they always want what they had
or what someone else has
kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi
i mean what is that
some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing
i mean how do you justify being a rabbi
and a gangster
i dont
im a bad man who doesnt waste time
wondering what couldve been
when i am what couldve been or not have been
i live on both sides of the fence
and my grass is always green
consider mr fisher
there are two men sitting here before you
and one of them you should be very afraid of
wheres my money
ive been hearing that a lot lately
my father used to say
the first time somebody calls you a horse
you punch him
the second time somebody calls you a horse
call him a jerk
but the third time somebody calls you a horse
perhaps its time to go shopping for a saddle
i dont have your money
this isnt like skipping out on the check
you owe me money
i have interests you owe them money
i dont even know how much money i owe you
33000
but im not nick fisher
then who the hell are you
im just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time
you have 48 hours to get my money
saul will keep an eye on you
in the meantime you may go now
wait i just have one question
i wasnt frisked
i see so being a rabbi a a religious man
there are three things a jew may not do
in order to save a life including his own
he may not idolworship commit adultery
or perform an act of premeditated murder
killing you before you killed me
would have been
kosher
exhales
acceptable
ive wired half the money
to your bank in the caymans
the other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground
now i can expect that when
very soon
good
so tell me the kid
what do you want with him
the kid and i have unfinished business
if theres one thing i know
its when someone is lying
a man in my position its all he has to go on
to know a lie when he hears it
its the difference between life and death
your own someone elses
that being said he wasnt lying
thats not nick fisher
i know
i came back here you were gone so
i went to the hotel without you to see my friend
she says the call to nick came from room 1009
a fellow registered under the name of smith
if you can believe that
its one of the most common names in the world
so theres bound to be a couple of em
but i get the feeling that this aint one of em
i get up to the tenth floor and just as i do
the door to room 1009 opens
and theres our mr smith in the flesh
so i pretend im walking to the elevator instead
of coming from it and we take it down together
he smiles at me  thanks  i smile back
but i have no idea who he is
but i think you might
so i take a picture using my cell phone
which i thought was a total waste
cos the photos look like shit and i never use it
so there i am pretending to dial a number
and taking smiths picture  him none the wiser
this is smith recognize him
no
i didnt think you would but it was worth a shot
anyway we take the elevator to the lobby
and the man who calls himself smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab
so i followed him
he went down
into an apartment building downtown
so i wait an hour goes by
and just when im getting ready to leave
who walks outside
smith
you
me
you out of the same building
with two hasidic jews on either side of you
friends of yours
not exactly
i think its time you told me that story
well theres this guy
and they call him the boss right
and then right across the street
theres this man they call the rabbi
why do they call him the rabbi
because hes a rabbi
so now i have to take out
to use the vernacular
the fairy in order to scratch a debt
that isnt even mine
and if thats not enough i have 48 hours to
come up with 33000 or the rabbis gonna
i dont know who mr smith is
and the worst part about it is
im not nick fisher
ironic
i know i dont even gamble
no i mean the mobster having a gay son
thats ironic
we are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here
things like that arent supposed to be real
its like amnesia
notwithstanding here you are
and nicks nowhere to be found so
id say youre fucked
fucked
shouldnt you be a little worried about this
i have ataraxia
ataraxia
its a condition characterized by freedom
from worry or any other preoccupation really
i have to have my answer
to the boss in the morning
oh what are you gonna say
what a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him
if he dresses to the right or to the left
whats that
yes
i knew you had sense
sense is something you have
when you have a choice
sometimes
sometimes its when you know you dont
nah dont move that bishop
its an obvious sucker bet
if you dont yyyou can have him in four moves
if you do hes gonna have you in mate in one
he doesnt see it
wouldnt matter if he did
elvis lets me win
everybody lets me win
wait a minute you know this game
the boss you got three days
i was thinking it would take me a week
oh you were thinking that were you
with all your experience killing people
ill tell you what
you win this game you got your week
hm
the boss so whats the plan with yitzchok
was gonna play it by ear
well if its all the same
id write it down its a tough tune
and by the way he has shadows
shadows
bodyguards
with him all the time
military
exisraeli mossad
the boss they go where he goes
roundtheclock exisraeli mossad
exisraeli mossad
that doesnt sound good
they live in the apartment next door
he wears a panic button on a chain
around his neck
looks like an ordinary star of david
he presses that button
and well we all know how that ends
whats this
oh god no you didnt
get down
silenced gunshot
response times gonna be
three to five seconds
hes gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it
where
where
the apartment
how do i get in his apartment
i cant just walk in the front door
no i was thinking youd use the back door
then what
he does the kid i do him
i plant my gun clean no history
and yitzchok  fire a round
get some powder burns on the hands
take the clothes off make it look like a
you do me i do you were both gay the
world doesnt understand us double suicide
and thats all there is to it
is that all there is to it
yeah its all there is to it
peww
im not such a bad guy you know
some folks have grown pretty fat off me
some have grown pretty dead
youre a conundrum you
you walk in here shooting your fucking mouth off
like you dont give a fuck if it gets shot off
you can only kill me once
checkmate
nobody says i have to kill you quick
cat
mouse
youve got three days
excuse me
who the fuck is this guy
dunno but whoever he is hes either in
very deep shit or i dont know what
because hes playing in the sandbox with
the darkies the skullcaps and who knows who
call murph and see if he got a match
on that photo marty snapped
yes boss
i want a complete rundown on this fucker
everything from a to z
who he is who does he know
the people he knows who do they know
i want to know
what the fuck he is doing in my fucking city
what have you got
get this
the kats in town
good kat
its the song junkies are singing
whats the happenstance
didnt know the happenstance
just said the word was the kats in town
um whos er whos good kat
real heavy hitter
the heaviest
he shows people die he vanishes
noone knows who he is or what he looks like
and he hasnt worked new york
in like two decades
just what we need
all right
and get some different fucking coffee in here
will you i gotta get to the fucking morgue
hey i figured it out
hey what did you figure out
you said that slim hopkins worked
for the boss right
well listen
the rabbi also had a bookie  benny begin
bennys at the morgue
somebody killed him and his goons
the morgue
didnt i say i was a coroner
no you didnt say you were a coroner
benny begin  killed by a baseball
my guess was a fastball
well either way it proves
that the good lord has a sense of humor
good morning detective
morning
you know this guy
bigtime bookie worked for the rabbi
why do they call him the rabbi
because hes a rabbi
between you and me
20 years ago he used to be my bookie
i used to sign my pay cheques over to him
what about the other two
did you get anything on them yet
these two were poisoned
something exotic
im running it down
well let me know
will do
prick
have a good day
you too detective
jimmy im taking my lunch break
dont you see
nick isnt missing hes hiding he set you up
nick set me up
like a bowling pin
nick found himself in a jam
he got you to take his place
he paid a street thug to mug you
but all he wants is your wallet and license
so he ignores the watch and suitcase
then nick kills slim hopkins and benny
the only guys who know what he looks like
and now youre left holding the bag
but i called nick i initiated contact
well maybe it just seems that way
what about smith
i still cant figure him out in all this
hm
you should run
i cant
theyll kill you if you stay
theyll kill me if i leave
go to the police
these guys buy cops like cops buy doughnuts
this isnt the first time this has happened
this isnt the first time a crime lord asked you
to kill the gay son of a rival
to pay off a friends debt whose place youre
staying in because you lost your job
and found your girlfriend with another guy
it is the first time it happened but nick has been
painting me into a corner since we were kids
i guess ive always been a better friend to him
yeah id love to hear the rest of this
but ive really gotta go back to work
oh hey hey
hey
i was just thinking that if youre still alive
when i get back from work tonight maybe
i dont know

if theres a great story behind how they met
you know seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again
if you and i fell in love
wed have one hell of a story to tell
wed be at a dinner party and someone
would ask howd you two meet

im not gay
im a cop
well im not a robber if you catch my drift
ive been watching you
i know what youre into
who are you i mean i know who youre not
youre not nick fisher
the guy whose apartment youre in
i know because nick
spent eight years in dade correctional
for forcing himself on a 14yearold cheerleader
dade county sent me a picture of nick fisher
and you are not him
so who the fuck are you
im just a guy whose dinners getting cold
may i leave now
come here
what
dead bodies in refrigerators cops in mens
rooms you remind me of james bond
that is the nicest thing
anybodys ever said to me
and the boss he could be kananga
kananga
no the boss is no kananga
well whos the boss
ernst stavro blofeld
which one donald pleasance
telly savalas max von sydow
you know your bond
but alas i was referring to anthony dawson
who
well he played blofeld
in from russia with love
well you never see blofelds face
in from russia with love
and thats when the villain is most effective
when you dont know what he looks like
so
see you later
slevin ah that was incredible
giggles you
i just realized something
whats that
i just made love to you
youre just realizing that now
and i have no idea who specifically you were
referring to when you said james bond
because earlier when you were telling me
that i reminded you of james bond
and i was saying that it was the nicest thing
anybodys ever said to me
i naturally assumed
you naturally assumed
you knew who i was talking about
because if you dont  if you werent talking
about the guy i think that youre talking about
well you have me mistaken for somebody else
because in my mind there is only one bond
well on that we agree
same time on three
one
two
three george lazenby
roger moore
george lazenby
roger moore i was kidding
yeah i was kidding
you were
the only james bond is

the boss i hired you to do a job
it wasnt supposed to look like a job

beginning to look very much
like a job
all right fuck it
if the rabbi wants a war
lll give him a war
saul
saul
saul the phones been
oh
i thought you were saul
people have been thinking im somebody else
your predicament reminds me of a story
hitchcock north by northwest
the movie where everybody thinks cary grant
is a man named george kaplan
but the thing is there is no george kaplan
its just a madeup name
but names even madeup ones
can bring about quite a bit of trouble
now
the woman in the picture with grant
her name was er
eva marie saint
oh you know this movie
i know this movie
i took my father to see it in 1959
his english wasnt very good
but boy did he like miss saint
after the movie he turned to me and he said
shes a real buick
you see he couldnt pronounce
the word beauty so hed say buick
caused quite a bit of confusion
using the wrong namell do that
is that my money
this is everything i owe you
its the sabbath you see
we dont answer the phone on the sabbath
i know
normally saul turns off the ringer
saul
i tell you you cant find good help these days
sauls dead
theyre all dead
oh ive been in this room before
looks the same as it did 20 years ago
somehow
somehow it seems different
the way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it
then again its been 20 years
since ive been in a car
two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass
due to a natural fear of highpowered rifles
and quiet rooftops in new jersey
20 years
locked away in my own paranoia
a prisoner in my own home
only to be delivered to fate by a boy
well anthony it looks as though youve won
if such a term may be applied
if i were wearing a hat i would take it off
should we get on with it then
you can keep your hat on schlomo
looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman
nice speech though
i wish i was standing for it
you you brought this upon our heads
me
you you hired good kat to kill my son
after you murdered my son
i had no hand in that
oh sure
just like in 84
i suppose you had no hand in that either
just a finger maybe
times up rabbi
lying to a dead mans
the same as lying to yourself
you were getting too big
see
problem when two men are standing in a room
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you
with their backs turned
their shirt collars smiling at me
then they called you the boss
it was clear what had to be done
try and appreciate how it feels schlomo
to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach
lying in a pool of your own blood and shit
the dead eyes of
of your wife staring back at you
the only thing keeping you from passing out
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall
looking for your son
i managed to save my son schlomo
and now
after all these years
in spite of our agreement
you you
fucking backstabbing philistine
you managed to take my son away from me
well
now ive taken your son away from you
i told you i had nothing to do with
you havent heard
will i
look at my face schlomo look at my smile
your son is dead
your son is dead
im gonna kill you hm
slevin rabbi
are you familiar with the shmoo
fisher
fisher listen to me
i already told you
im not nick fisher
then who is nick fisher
i think you mean who was nick fisher
fisher was the answer to a question
how do you get to two men
that cant be gotten to
you get them to come to you
but to do that i needed a name
and where do you find names
in books
and who has books
well your bookies have books
hes clean
slevin crooked bookies
who work with bigtime crooks
so why are you here
i was looking for a gambler
one who was in both books
with a lot of red in the minus column
got him
and thats when i found nick fisher
a lowlife that noone was gonna miss
nick fisher
ok
goodkat there was a time
all that was left to do was make the phone ring
all i had to do was pull the trigger
and wait for you to call the man
who does the jobs that noone else wants
the boss i want an outsider brought in
theres a specialist
calls himself mr good kat
fine
tell him he can expect me in the morning
are you ready
yeah
its just that one last thing
the boss mr good kat
its been a long time
im sorry to have kept you waiting mr good kat
so ill get right down to business
slim hopkins the man who ran my book
was hit yesterday
and i guess youve already heard about
my son
yes i heard
i need you to sort it out for me
whos the mark
yitzchok
yitzchok the rabbis son
you remember the rabbi
i remember the rabbi well
thing is
it cant look like a job
if yitzchok gets hit the rabbi will go to war
so i need you to make it look like
it aint what it is
can that be done
anything can be done
good how
kansas city shuffle
im not familiar with the term
ill need to see slims books
slims books were taken when he was hit
but i do keep copies
what are you looking for
this is our guy nick  1729
nick fisher
why him
a loser
pick him up bring him here
goodkat still not talking to each other huh
cant say that i blame you
why are you here
big job
i was under the impression
you no longer worked new york
like i said very big job
and you thought as long as youre in town
youd drop by and see your old pal schlomo
and say hello how about them yanks
no but something like that
only problem is you and i arent old friends
and i hate baseball
and since were not friends and
you hate baseball why the fuck are you here
its because were not friends that im here
because if we had been friends
i wouldnt have been hired to kill your son
because that is right at the top of my list
of things that friends do not do to their friends
the good news for you is
my friendship is for sale
you see it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive
than he does to the boss dead
and more money means more to me
than less money
and you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress
im listening
you will pay me double to kill the boss
what the boss was paying me to kill yitzchok
ohh
and that
and that will make us friends
right rabbi
hm
and since friends do favors for their friends
you will do a favor for me
pray tell what is this favor
concerns a matter of debt collection
one debt in particular
whose
a flop from bennys book
goes by the name of nick fisher
who is he
just a loser
you just made a lot of money
slevin and then i was free
to come and go as i pleased
hm
whatever theyre paying you
oh
there is nobody
i did this to you
me
you
me
who are you
brikowskl who is he
considering he no longer has fingerprints
id say its unlikely well ever know
what about dental records
sure find the bottom half of the jaw then all
we need to do is find out who the dentist was
what a fucking mess
hey brikowski its marty you there
we found two more bodies
to go along with the two youve already got
all right ill be right over
did you ever get a hold of the rabbi so he can
get down here and identify whats left of his kid
negative
weve been calling for the last hour no answer
send somebody over
copy
you all right you look a little shookup
no im fine
all right
yeah
hey brikowski its murphy
hey murph whats up
harry kello came by today
you remember harry
he retired a few years ago his wife just died
so he comes in a couple of times a week
talks shop tells stories to the rooks
starts every sentence with the way
things used to be guy living in the past
yeah yeah what about him
were making small talk
guy says he cant complain
then all he does is fuckin complain
his dead wife the leg he got shot in
his crappy pension
but then he stops when he sees the picture
marty snapped of your kid
just stares at it
i say what is it you know the kid
thing is he aint looking at the picture
but at the name
ive got it written at the bottom
he knows that name slevin
i have that same phone
about an hour later the phone rings its harry
talking like a goddamned machine gun
going on and on about a horse race back in 79
aqueduct
seven horse tenth race  ring a bell
race start bell
it was a drug store handicap
big windup around the time the boss
the rabbi set up shop in new york
before people started
waking up with knives in their backs
anyway he goes on about this local legend
about this kid
his name was max
max placed a bet with a bookie named roth
roth laid the bet off
on you
and you
but when the rabbi and the boss
find out the fix is in
they are the opposite of happy
word comes down an example is to be made
aargh
these guys kill everyone
and i mean every one
max his wife his kid roth
even the goddamned horse died
these guys went to town with a tomahawk
it was a fucking massacre
they had to bring in a specialist to do the kid
cos nobody would take the job
what have you done with my son
you
no
youre dead
youre dead
so harrys going on about how they had to
bring in a specialist to kill the kid
but i aint seeing the connection
so i says what has this to do with the case
he says the horses name
i say what about the horses name
he says the horses name was
lucky number slevin
what is your name
slevin kelevra
do you remember this part
please i have a family
not any more you dont
henry sobs
you fucking bastards
you fucking bastards
the two of you killed everything i ever loved
fuck you both
now there is no such person as slevin kelevra
as far as i can tell
which means the kid was using a pseudonym
which is interesting
him picking the name of a dead racehorse
and keeping company
with the boss and the rabbi
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse
i thought to myself maybe it means something
then again maybe its just a coincidence
names gotta come from someplace  right
i guess none of this really matters
now that the kids gone cold
ah one more thing
weve got a new guy in the precinct
jewish fella funny little guy talks a lot
anyway in case youre interested
he says the name kelevra is hebrew
he says it means
bad dog
brikowskl
20 years ago he used to be my bookie
i used to sign my pay cheques over to him
brikowski you there
your girl made me
she took my picture
shes got to go in the ground
ok
i have something i have to tell you
he told me that we needed to kill you
youre gonna have to trust me
shit
hes going to shoot you here
i didnt think youd understand
i understood
how did you find out about us
im a worldclass assassin fuckhead
how do you think i found out
