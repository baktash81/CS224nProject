there was a time 
4 35 
you misunderstood 
i wasn t asking for the time 
i was just saying   there was a time  
there was a time 
mm hm 
take brown sugar back there  for example 
she s pretty fucking foxy  right 
she s 70 
if she s a day 
but there was a time 
  i don t follow 
  the name s smith  i m from out of town 
  listen  mr  smith   
  just smith 
the reason i m in town 
in case you re wondering   
   is because of a kansas city shuffle 
what s a kansas city shuffle 
kansas city shuffle is
when everybody looks right and you go left 
  never heard of it 
  hm 
it s not something people hear about 
falls on deaf ears mostly 
but this particular one s
been over 20 years in the making 
20 years  huh 
no small matter 
requires a lot of planning 
it involves a lot of people 
people connected only
by the slightest of events 
like whispers in the night   
   in that place that never forgets
even when those people do 
it all starts with a horse 
it s what they called back then
a drugstore handicap 
a guy wants what the fella calls a sure thing 
so he schemes to make it so 
he calls in the doc  a nobbler from antwerp
known for his savvy but not for his discretion 
woma n  oh  fuck me  baby  fuck me  baby 
the same could be said
for doc s jelly on the side   gloria 
  almost there  almost there 
  oh  god  oh  god 
hey  which horse did you say
it was again  baby 
which brings us to abe  because gloria
was too much jelly for one outfit 
hey  baby  is your wife around 
  what do you want 
woma n  who is it  abe 
ah    it s seymour 
gloria  sure  tell that bitch to open her eyes 
maybe then she d see more 
seymour says hello 
what are you doing calling me here 
christmas came early this year  baby 
i got a present for you 
remember my friend doc 
smith  now abe wasn t a nosy fella 
but he had a nose 
and right below his nose was his mouth 
abe  do you remember gloria the hooker 
well  gloria s got this friend doc
who s got a line on a doped up racehorse 
the fix is in at aqueduct 
  seventh horse  tenth race 
  doped up 
smith 
and then there was this joker who had ears   
abe  let s get back 
smith      who looked like somebody s uncle 
max  who s your favorite uncle 
ok  who s your second favorite uncle 
just pay attention 
i got something here 
smith  and before you know it 
folks are getting a big dose of the gimmies 
and men start talking their hats off 
and that manischewitz grapevine wine spills in
your ear and tells you  you got a sure thing 
and what s worse is  you start to believe it 
at least that s how it went with old max 
who wasn t so much old  as he was tired 
tired of being a dog without a day 
tired of waking up and finding
that his dreams were only dreams 
we re leaving 
but mostly 
max was tired of not having a front lawn 
make sure he doesn t come home late 
  i will 
  i was talking to your son 
   giggles 
  you think that s funny  do you 
uh huh  bye  mom 
yeah  bye  mom 
love you 
tannoy  they re off 
all right  if your ma asks 
where were we today 
  shea stadium 
  to see 
  mets v phillies 
  good man  give me the post game 
stallard gave up six runs in the first five innings 
ed kranepool hit a line drive down right field
but it hit the wall  fouled by a foot 
gonder hit a groundball
between first and second
but he s so slow  second baseman
tony taylor tagged him out at first 
did you get all that from the radio 
mm  hm 
you re good 
ok  i ll be right back 
no  no  no  you ve got to stay in the car 
why 
because they don t let little boys inside the track 
saul s dad takes him to the track 
well  saul s dad is a degenerate gambler 
and if you re the son of a degenerate gambler 
they let you in 
it s economically viable 
are you going to be a degenerate gambler 
hey  you know better than that 
your old man s smart 
he only plays a sure thing 
look 
this money s gonna get you through harvard 
and you re gonna be a doctor 
but until then   
you ve got to stay in the car 
hey 
next weekend  you and me go to a ballgame 
  ok 
  ok 
i love you  kid 
i love you too  dad 
wait  watch  watch  watch  watch 
i almost forgot  15 minutes 
start counting 
tannoy 
the next race at the aqueduct is the tenth race 
  come on  come on 
tannoy  the field is making towards
the final turn  and number seven has moved
into fifth position on the outside 
  number two has the lead   
   cheering 
come on 
number one is against the rail 
and number seven is beginning
to pick up the pace on the outside 
yes 
yes  come on  baby  come on 
  let s go 
   cheering intensifies 
    to challenge  goes clear
and number seven takes the lead 
it s number seven who now has the lead 
it s strolling clear 
yes 
oh 
number seven has fallen 
number one comes home
and takes the lead to win it 
smith  max woke up to find his dreams
had just been the stuff of pipes 
  i want to place a bet 
  how much 
20 large 
oh  you must feel real lucky 
i ll take your bet 
and lay it off 
i ve got a bookie s bookie 
i ll give you 2 1 on the horse 
uh uh  the racing form says 9 1 
so you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand 
and you get 9 1 if the spread sticks 
you come in here with your pockets turned out 
you get 2 1 
the juice is ten 
that means if you lose  you re all in for 22 grand 
20 for the bet  two for the juice 
can you pay these monies  huh  can you 
yeah 
just to be clear 
if you lose   
   you re gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to 
henry 
henry 
henry 
henry 
hey  buddy  you got a light 
no  henry 
in that case  how about the 20 gs
you just blew on the seven horse 
  what have you done with my son 
  he s on his way home  just like you 
urgh 
where am i 
roth  he ll tell you everything  i swear 
he already has 
please 
i have a family 
please 
please 
where s my boy 
henry 
where are they 
henry 
henry 
fuck 
shit 
jesus 
 fuck  shit  jesus  is right 
i don t understand 
why did they kill max s family 
new outfit in town 
they didn t want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them 
trying to make an impression 
that s a fucking story  man 
charlie chaplin entered a charlie chaplin
look a like contest in monte carlo
and came in third 
now that s a story 
this   
this is something else 
so that s a kansas city shuffle 
no 
it s just the inciting incident 
the catalyst 
this   is a kansas city shuffle 
they look right   
and you   
go left 
sorry about that  son 
sometimes there s more to life than just living 
besides    you can t have a kansas city shuffle
without a body 
  he s down 
  get the roof 
up there 
i m coming 
coming 
it took you long enough 
you re not nick 
you re not as tall as i thought you d be 
well  i m short for my height 
that makes sense because i can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock 
you have a deceptively tall knock 
congratulations 
so it s a good thing 
i open the door expecting you to be up here 
you re down here 
that combined with a low centre of gravity  
forget about it 
who are you 
i m slevin 
and what happened to your nose 
i was using it to break some guy s fist 
somebody hit you 
yeah    i was kind of expecting it  though 
you were kind of expecting it 
well  they say bad things happen in threes 
first    i lost my job 
then i came home to find
my apartment building had been condemned
due to a hybrid breed
of ecuadorian super termites 
so i went to my girlfriend kelly s 
i had a key so i let myself in 
  hey  don t stop on my account 
  oh shit 
slevin 
it was an accident 
what  like he tripped and you fell 
ma n  slevin  do you know what time it is 
i m at the airport 
are you sure you want me to come out 
yeah  two weeks in new york
and the only kelly you ll remember
is the kelly who gave you your first hand job
on the bus to summer camp 
kelly perkins  said her hands were dry
and she needed   
she said that to a lot of guys 
that s why we called her jerkins perkins 
  just call me when you land  all right 
  yeah 
yeah  i just got into town  nick 
i m on my way over to your place 
say  man  you got the time 
ya  man  it s uh    7 23 
so you re probably still asleep 
  yo  you got a smoke 
  no  i don t smoke  man 
why don t you just go ahead and give me
your wallet and i ll buy my own smokes 
am i being mugged 
man 
and so here i am 
you said three 
  what 
  you said bad things happen in threes 
you lost your job  your apartment was
condemned  kelly was cheating on you
and you got mugged   that makes four 
when you re on a roll  you re on a roll 
interesting  although i would add 
not the ever so clever hold up man
one hears so much about 
  well  he did break my nose 
  but overlooked your suitcase 
maybe it wouldn t make for a speedy getaway 
true  but then there s the matter of your watch 
pretty fancy 
  it s a fake 
  but he didn t know that 
  maybe he didn t see it 
  he saw it  he asked you for the time 
you say this was your third mugging 
uh    i travel a lot 
where s nick 
i don t know  he was supposed to
meet me here  he never showed up 
  how did you get in 
  door was open 
  door was open 
  yeah 
  open or unlocked 
  i don t remember 
  you said open 
  could have been  what was your name again 
lindsey  i live across the hall 
  oh 
  i came over to borrow a cup of sugar 
  where s your cup 
  i came to borrow a cup of sugar 
if i had a cup  i d have come to borrow sugar 
  touch√© 
   phone rings 
maybe that s nick  it s right there 
hello 
hello 
they hung up 
i have an idea  have you used the phone
since you ve been here 
no  except for that 
sorry  wrong number 
that was the hotel cheval 
what are you doing 
we know who he called  who called him 
  columbo says three things   
  columbo 
yeah  columbo was this tv detective
played by peter falk   
i know who columbo is  yeah 
he looked for three things at a crime scene 
what s there now that wasn t before 
what was there before that isn t now 
  and what s been moved 
  is this a crime scene 
  i think nick s in trouble 
  ah 
sorry  wrong number 
that was the hotel cheval again 
so what  he called the hotel 
the hotel called him back  makes sense 
so  maybe it s a clue 
  a clue to what 
  a clue to what happened to nick 
  we don t know anything did 
  we don t know anything didn t 
you re here  he s not  the door was open 
bad things happen where you   
shit  i ve got to stop by work 
just for a couple of hours  i ll come back 
then we can start the investigation 
  the investigation 
  uh huh  it ll be fun 
ok 
i totally forgot   
yeah 
sorry 
  may i borrow a cup of sugar 
  what 
i never gave it much thought
until i put up a fresh pot of coffee 
i was on my way to the store
and i thought nick d have sugar 
you tell me your story  i leave  sugarless 
i come back  you put your penis on exhibition 
although the coffee s probably gone bad
by now  i insist on following through 
it s like a norman rockwell painting 
what  my penis 
no  no  the sugar 
neighbors borrowing sugar from one another 
it s very um    andy griffith 
yeah 
that s andy griffith 
the penis thing is not very mayberry 
no 
thanks for the sugar    sugar 
i wanted to try and catch the next show 
i don t go on again till eight 
whew 
it s not nearly eight o clock yet 
  the boss wants to see you 
  who    
  the boss 
  who s the boss 
  the guy we work for 
  jesus 
come here and sit your punk ass down 
go 
i m not the guy you re looking for 
i don t live here 
well  you look like the guy that lives here 
then you don t know what he looks like 
he means to say you look like you live here 
yeah  that s what i mean to say 
i look like i live here  but i don t 
i m just visiting  i just got in this morning 
the cat i m looking for  his name is uh   
  his name is nick  man 
  nick 
the cat s name is nick  now   
who are you 
i m slevin 
you got some id 
the funny thing about that is
i got mugged this morning 
look  look 
tell it to the one legged man 
so he can bump it off down the road 
  hey  listen  motherfucker   
  yo  i got this 
  slow  slow  slow  slow your roll  man 
  i got this 
just let me  just let me  all right 
motherfucker 
all i know is 
the boss slides me this here address 
and he says   sloe    that s him 
 elvis    that s me 
 bring me the cat
who resides at this here address  
now he told me that today 
you just so happen to be here today 
so i guess you the cat i m supposed to pick up 
today 
but i m not nick 
yeah  well  unfortunately for you 
you re not the first cat to tell me
you wasn t the guy i was looking for 
you can ask lindsey  she lives across the hall 
she lives here 
hold on  man  i ain t asking nobody nothing 
nick  slevin  clark kent  
whatever your name is 
the virgin mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass 
titties hanging out and everything 
if she told me your name was jesus christ  i
still gotta take you to see the boss  know why 
no 
orders 
now  you do know what orders is  right 
orders is orders 
so i guess no one ever taught you not to use
the word you re defining in the definition 
say something else  i will break
your motherfucking nose  i ain t playing 
my nose is already broken 
  can i just say one more thing 
  what 
can you turn the heat up in here
cos it s really cold 
uh    yeah 
y you    you should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip 
slevin  ah  jeez   sighs 
  it s cold out there 
  let s hurry it up  man 
yo  grab his ass 
the boss is right up there  chump 
well  listen 
your boys elvis and sloe
picked up the wrong guy 
  i m not nick fisher 
  mr  fisher 
are you familiar with the shmoo  mr  fisher 
a comic strip i liked as a boy 
the shmoo was a loveable creature  really 
laid eggs   
gave milk   
   and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger 
the shmoo loved to be eaten 
it could taste like any food you desire 
shmoo hide  cut thin  made fine leather 
even shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks 
in essence  the shmoo supplied
all of the world s wants 
i only bring up the shmoo because it s relevant
to you and why you were brought here 
i m sorry  who are you 
i m the boss 
i thought he was the boss 
why 
do we look alike 
so  mr  fisher   
you were gonna tell me something 
i don t know  you brought me here 
yes  i did 
back when you thought i was him 
i never thought you were him 
i thought he was you 
i was trying to tell him  you   
that they picked up the wrong guy 
  wrong guy for what 
  what you wanted to see me about 
  know what i wanted to see you about 
  no 
then how do you know i have the wrong guy 
  because i m not   
  maybe i wanted to give you  96 000 
in that case  do i still have the wrong guy 
do you want to give me  96 000 
no  do you want to give me  96 000 
no  should i 
i don t know  should you 
i don t know  should i 
long story short 
  i think we re well past that point 
  i ll bet it was that mouth that got you that nose 
ok  i m under the impression that you re
under the impression that i owe you  96 000 
no  you owe slim hopkins  96 000 
you owe slim  slim owes me 
you owe me 
well  in that case  is slim around 
hey  slim  do you know this cat 
slim 
no use 
ever since somebody shot him 
old slim went deaf 
what happened to make slim go deaf 
why 
because i owe you  96 000 and i might have
a slight problem coming up with the money 
oh  ok 
well  why don t we just make it an even 90 
i may have exaggerated the slightness 
hm 
well  why don t i just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favor 
well  that depends on the favor 
the boss  that was my son 
notice how i said  was  
yeah 
that s because he s dead 
murdered 
relegated to the past tense 
sent from an is to a was
before he d had his breakfast 
bummer 
lex talionis 
the law of retaliation 
a pact was broken 
my son was murdered 
so the rabbi s son must share the same fate 
whose son 
the rabbi s 
why do they call him the rabbi 
because   
because he s a rabbi 
who s his son 
  yitzchok 
  yitzchok  yitzchok and the rabbi 
yitzchok the fairy 
why do they call him the fairy 
because he s a fairy 
he has wings  can fly 
sprinkles magic dust all over the place 
  he s homosexual 
  right 
come on 
  so how does the rabbi feel about that 
  he doesn t know 
  you know  but he doesn t 
  everybody knows 
  except the rabbi 
  that s right 
so where do i fit in 
you 
you re the trigger man 
me 
you 
aren t there professionals 
people you can hire to do this sort of thing 
of course there are 
yes 
but you owe me  96 000 
why should i go out and pay someone else
when i ve already paid you 
hm  sorry  kid 
but your money just isn t long enough 
which means you re in my pocket 
which means
if you don t do what i want you to do 
you re gonna go from my pocket to my fridge 
slim could use the company 
i could use the shmoo 
so i ll expect your answer by morning 
is there anything else 
well  i don t suppose i have to say anything
as trite and clich√©d as 
 go to the police and you re a dead man  
i think you just did 
i guess i did 
so  let me see if i ve got this right 
i m paying you a lot of money to kill somebody
and you re getting somebody else to do it 
don t worry 
i m gonna kill somebody 
better call brikowski 
tell him there s a new face in town 
  hey 
  nick still hasn t shown  huh 
  no 
  what s with you and that towel 
oh    lindsey   
  it s a very long story 
  get dressed  and tell me about it on the way 
where are we going 
all we know is that somebody called nick
from the hotel cheval 
i spoke to a friend who works there 
they keep a record of every call made 
she can access the computer and we can
find out what room the call came from 
what is it 
  i know this guy 
  who 
this guy 
you know that guy 
yeah  i met him 
he was dead 
you met a dead guy 
yeah 
in a walk in freezer 
bookmaker slim hopkins reported missing 
police have no leads 
blah  blah  blah  yada  yada   
a spokesperson commented off the record 
 ironic that hopkins should go missing 
considering he s allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself  
i think it s time you told me that story
about why you re still wearing that towel 
  do you mind if i get dressed first 
   phone rings 
could be my friend from the hotel  be right back 
hm 
hey  lindsey  i don t think it s such a good idea
that we continue to   
put your shoes on  schlomo wants to see you 
i don t know anyone named schlomo 
someone named schlomo knows you 
that is your only concern 
let s go 
like i said  i don t know   
aaahh    better   
i think it s better if you let me do the talking 
you think 
what is it 
he s sorry that he hit you 
  do you always speak for him 
  yes 
hm 
so  he s a mute  then 
not quite 
well  what  then 
it s personal  you ll have to ask him 
  hm  how would he tell me 
  he wouldn t 
  hey  are we going to the    
  no 
  but he s right there 
  a different outfit entirely 
right across the street from one another 
at one time they were one with one another 
and then they tried to kill one another 
and now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation
for fear of what the other man will do to him 
let me guess  all the way up 
penthouse 
gentle piano music
you must be mr  fisher 
must i  because    that hasn t been
working out for me lately 
  but i m afraid you must 
  well  if i must 
do you know for what reason
you ve been brought here 
for starters  i m unlucky 
the unlucky are nothing more than
a frame of reference for the lucky  mr  fisher 
you are unlucky so i may know that i am not 
unfortunately  the lucky never realize
they are lucky until it s too late 
take yourself for instance  yesterday
you were better off than you are today 
but it took today for you to realize it  but   
today has arrived  and it s too late  you see 
people are never happy with what they have 
they always want what they had 
or what someone else has 
kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster 
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi 
i mean  what is that 
some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing 
i mean  how do you justify being a rabbi
and a gangster 
i don t 
i m a bad man who doesn t waste time
wondering what could ve been 
when i am what could ve been or not have been 
i live on both sides of the fence 
and my grass is always green 
consider  mr  fisher   
   there are two men sitting here before you 
and one of them you should be very afraid of 
where s my money 
  i ve been hearing that a lot lately 
  my father used to say 
 the first time somebody calls you a horse 
you punch him 
the second time somebody calls you a horse 
call him a jerk 
but the third time somebody calls you a horse 
perhaps it s time to go shopping for a saddle  
  i don t have your money 
  this isn t like skipping out on the check 
you owe me money 
i have interests  you owe them money 
  i don t even know how much money i owe you 
   33 000 
  but i m not nick fisher 
  then who the hell are you 
i m just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time 
you have 48 hours to get my money 
saul will keep an eye on you 
in the meantime  you may go now 
wait  i just have one question 
i wasn t frisked 
i see  so  being a rabbi  a    a religious man   
there are three things a jew may not do
in order to save a life  including his own 
he may not idol worship  commit adultery 
or perform an act of premeditated murder 
killing you before you killed me
would have been   
  kosher 
   exhales 
acceptable 
i ve wired half the money
to your bank in the caymans 
the other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground 
now i can expect that when 
  very soon 
  good 
so  tell me  the kid   
what do you want with him 
the kid and i have unfinished business 
if there s one thing i know 
it s when someone is lying 
a man in my position  it s all he has to go on 
to know a lie when he hears it 
it s the difference between life and death  
your own  someone else s 
that being said  he wasn t lying 
that s not nick fisher 
i know 
i came back here  you were gone  so 
i went to the hotel without you to see my friend 
she says the call to nick came from room 1009 
a fellow registered under the name of smith 
if you can believe that 
it s one of the most common names in the world 
so there s bound to be a couple of  em 
but i get the feeling that this ain t one of  em 
i get up to the tenth floor  and just as i do 
the door to room 1009 opens
and there s our mr  smith  in the flesh 
so  i pretend i m walking to the elevator instead
of coming from it and we take it down together 
he smiles at me   thanks   i smile back 
but i have no idea who he is
but i think you might 
so i take a picture using my cell phone
which i thought was a total waste
cos the photos look like shit and i never use it 
so there i am pretending to dial a number 
and taking smith s picture   him none the wiser 
this is smith  recognize him 
no 
i didn t think you would  but it was worth a shot 
anyway  we take the elevator to the lobby 
and the man who calls himself smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab 
so i followed him 
he went down
into an apartment building downtown 
so i wait  an hour goes by 
and just when i m getting ready to leave  
who walks outside 
  smith 
  you 
me 
you out of the same building
with two hasidic jews on either side of you 
friends of yours 
not exactly 
i think it s time you told me that story 
well  there s this guy
and they call him the boss  right 
and then  right across the street
there s this man they call the rabbi 
  why do they call him the rabbi 
  because he s a rabbi 
so now i have to  take out  
to use the vernacular 
the fairy  in order to scratch a debt
that isn t even mine 
and if that s not enough  i have 48 hours to
come up with  33 000 or the rabbi s gonna   
i don t know who mr  smith is 
and the worst part about it is 
i m not nick fisher 
ironic 
i know  i don t even gamble 
no  i mean the mobster having a gay son 
that s ironic 
we are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here 
things like that aren t supposed to be real 
it s like amnesia 
notwithstanding  here you are 
and nick s nowhere to be found  so   
i d say you re fucked 
fucked 
shouldn t you be a little worried about this 
i have ataraxia 
ataraxia 
it s a condition characterized by freedom
from worry or any other preoccupation really 
i have to have my answer
to the boss in the morning 
oh  what are you gonna say 
what a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him
  if he dresses to the right or to the left 
  what s that 
yes 
i knew you had sense 
sense is something you have
when you have a choice 
sometimes 
sometimes it s when you know you don t 
nah  don t move that bishop 
it s an obvious sucker bet 
if you don t  y y you can have him in four moves 
if you do  he s gonna have you in mate in one 
he doesn t see it 
wouldn t matter if he did 
elvis lets me win 
everybody lets me win

oh  you were thinking that  were you 
with all your experience killing people

you win this game  you got your week 
hm

i plant my gun  clean  no history 
and yitzchok   fire a round 
get some powder burns on the hands 
take the clothes off  make it look like a 
 you do me  i do you  we re both gay  the
world doesn t understand us   double suicide 
and that s all there is to it 
is that all there is to it 
yeah  it s all there is to it 
peww 
i m not such a bad guy  you know 
some folks have grown pretty fat off me 
some have grown pretty dead 
you re a conundrum  you 
you walk in here shooting your fucking mouth off
like you don t give a fuck if it gets shot off 
you can only kill me once 
checkmate 
nobody says i have to kill you quick 
cat 
mouse 
you ve got three days 
excuse me 
who the fuck is this guy 
dunno  but whoever he is  he s either in
very deep shit or i don t know what 
because he s playing in the sandbox with
the darkies  the skullcaps and who knows who 
call murph and see if he got a match
on that photo marty snapped 
yes  boss 
i want a complete rundown on this fucker 
everything from a to z 
who he is  who does he know 
the people he knows  who do they know 
i want to know
what the fuck he is doing in my fucking city 
  what have you got 
  get this 
the kat s in town 
good kat 
  it s the song junkies are singing 
  what s the happenstance 
didn t know the happenstance 
just said the word was the kat s in town 
um    who s er    who s good kat 
real heavy hitter 
  the heaviest 
  he shows  people die  he vanishes 
no one knows who he is  or what he looks like 
and he hasn t worked new york
in  like  two decades 
just what we need 
all right 
and get some different fucking coffee in here 
will you  i gotta get to the fucking morgue 
  hey  i figured it out 
  hey  what did you figure out 
you said that slim hopkins worked
for the boss  right 
well  listen 
the rabbi also had a bookie   benny begin 
benny s at the morgue 
somebody killed him and his goons 
  the morgue 
  didn t i say i was a coroner 
no  you didn t say you were a coroner 
benny begin   killed by a baseball 
my guess was a fastball 
well  either way it proves
that the good lord has a sense of humor 
  good morning  detective 
  morning 
  you know this guy 
  big time bookie  worked for the rabbi 
  why do they call him the rabbi 
  because he s a rabbi 
between you and me   
20 years ago he used to be my bookie 
i used to sign my pay cheques over to him 
what about the other two 
did you get anything on them yet 
these two were poisoned 
something exotic 
  i m running it down 
  well  let me know 
will do 
prick 
  have a good day 
  you too  detective 
jimmy  i m taking my lunch break 
don t you see 
nick isn t missing  he s hiding  he set you up 
  nick set me up 
  like a bowling pin 
nick found himself in a jam 
he got you to take his place 
he paid a street thug to mug you 
but all he wants is your wallet and license
so he ignores the watch and suitcase 
then nick kills slim hopkins and benny 
the only guys who know what he looks like 
and now you re left holding the bag 
  but i called nick  i initiated contact 
  well  maybe it just seems that way 
  what about smith 
  i still can t figure him out in all this 
hm 
  you should run 
  i can t 
  they ll kill you if you stay 
  they ll kill me if i leave 
  go to the police 
  these guys buy cops like cops buy doughnuts 
this isn t the first time this has happened 
this isn t the first time a crime lord asked you
to kill the gay son of a rival
to pay off a friend s debt whose place you re
staying in because you lost your job
and found your girlfriend with another guy 
it is the first time it happened  but nick has been
painting me into a corner since we were kids 
i guess i ve always been a better friend to him   
yeah  i d love to hear the rest of this
but i ve really gotta go back to work 
  oh  hey  hey 
  hey 
i was just thinking that if you re still alive
when i get back from work tonight  maybe   
i don t know 
we could go to dinner or something 
yeah  that would be great  yeah 
  really 
  yeah 
   chuckles 
  yeah 
ok  um    no  bye 
hm   
weird 
what 
i was just thinking about what it would be like
if we d met under different circumstances 
see  i think people should only fall in love
if there s a great story behind how they met 
you know  seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again 
if you and i fell in love 
we d have one hell of a story to tell 
we d be at a dinner party and someone
would ask   how d you two meet  
and i d say   you tell the story  dear  
and you d say   no  you tell it better  
so  come here often 
no  but i heard about someone who does 
  you mean    the fairy 
  yeah 
  is he    
  yeah 
where 
this is absurd  what are you thinking 
  i m thinking of a new option 
  what 
  talking with him 
  talking with him 
talking 
you re gonna go over and say   i m slevin 
some bad dudes think i am someone i am not 
and i m gonna have to take you out
or they re gonna take me out
and i was wondering 
you wanna talk about it  
  i can t do that 
  you think 
look  i can t just walk over there 
he s got bodyguards 
aside from that  you re pretty much dead on 
  bodyguards 
  yeah  right behind him  two of them  israelis 
beards  right behind him 
see  em 
  you re getting good at this 
  thanks 
how are you gonna have a talk with him 
when he goes to the bathroom 
i ll follow him in 
what do you think 
could someone tell me why i m in the van 
because i could only get a reservation for two 
all right  the fairy s at a table in the middle 
bodyguards nearby 
our boy s not far away
but i can t make out who s with him 
  did murph get a beat on him yet 
  murph says  whoever he is  he s a ghost 
can t find anyone who s ever even
bumped into him  much less tripped over him 
the fairy s going to the bathroom 
and our boy s making a move  shit 
  marty  the door s locked 
  relax 
it s not gonna go down in the men s room 
i got it next 
  what went down in the men s room 
  we talked 
and 
i told him i thought we should get together 
  you didn t 
  i did 
and 
  i got a date 
  do you think this is safe 
it can t be any worse than what s waiting for me
behind door number two 
it s gonna be tough  i think i picked up a pigtail 
  a what 
  the cops 
oh  a pig tail  cute 
i ran into a nosy cop in the men s room 
you and me need to talk 
  do i know you 
  no  but i know you 
listen  i m sorry  no offence  but i m not   
i m not gay 
  i m a cop 
  well  i m not a robber if you catch my drift 
i ve been watching you 
i know what you re into 
who are you  i mean  i know who you re not 
you re not nick fisher 
the guy whose apartment you re in 
i know because nick
spent eight years in dade correctional
for forcing himself on a 14 year old cheerleader 
dade county sent me a picture of nick fisher 
and you    are not him 
so    who the fuck are you 
i m just a guy whose dinner s getting cold 
may i leave now 
  come here 
  what 
dead bodies in refrigerators  cops in men s
rooms  you remind me of    james bond 
that is the nicest thing
anybody s ever said to me 
and the boss  he could be kananga 
kananga 
  no  the boss is no kananga 
  well  who s the boss 
ernst stavro blofeld 
which one  donald pleasance 
telly savalas  max von sydow 
you know your bond 
but alas  i was referring to anthony dawson 
who 
well  he played blofeld
in from russia with love 
well  you never see blofeld s face
in from russia with love 
and that s when the villain is most effective 
when you don t know what he looks like 
so   
see you later 
slevin  ah  that was incredible 
   giggles  you   
  i just realized something 
  what s that 
  i just made love to you 
  you re just realizing that now 
and i have no idea who specifically you were
referring to when you said james bond 
because earlier when you were telling me
that i reminded you of james bond 
and i was saying that it was the nicest thing
anybody s ever said to me 
i naturally assumed   
you naturally assumed
you knew who i was talking about 
because if you don t   if you weren t talking
about the guy i think that you re talking about 
well  you have me mistaken for somebody else 
because in my mind there is only one bond 
well  on that we agree 
same time on three 
  one   
  two   
  three  george lazenby 
  roger moore 
  george lazenby 
  roger moore  i was kidding 
  yeah  i was kidding 
  you were 
the only james bond is   
  timothy dalton 
  pierce brosnan 
  scotland forever 
  i feel so much better 
why are you going 
i m just going to get us some coffee 
ok 
hurry back to me 
wendy rene  after laughter
when you re in love  you re happy
oh  and when you re in her arms
you gain
after   
hey  police

after   
after your laughter
good morning  i m detective dumbrowski 
good morning  detective 
am i being kidnapped 
nope  we just want to have
a quick  friendly word with you 
is this standard operating procedure
you d find in the policeman s manual
if you look up  quick  friendly word  
there is no sop for the box
you got yourself into 
oh 
  so what do you want to talk to me about 
  you 
  what about me 
  who are you 
  philosophically speaking 
  name 
  rank  serial number   
  you should really play ball

  what is your name 
  oh  yeah  i remember  slevin kelevra 
k e l e v r a 
  kelevra 
  look  kid 
i don t know what s going on 
or how you re into this 
but when i figure out what there is to figure out 
i m not gonna be so nice to you 
oh  this is nice  don t do me any favors 
last chance to come clean 
take a walk 
i think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far 
when you re in love
you re happy
oh  and when you re in her arms
you gain
after
this doesn t matter   
i have to go to work 
hey 
after
after   
  hey  guys  what are you doing here 
  now s the time 
i ve got at least    jesus 
the boss says he wants you to look nice
for the fairy 
you re early 
why don t you come in and fix yourself a drink 
i was just getting ready 
you ll have to excuse the   
i wasn t expecting you for   
you look good 
  you want some wine 
  no 
is something the matter 
somebody s trying to kill you 
who 
me 
  that was close 
  yeah 
close 
the boss  i hired you to do a job 
it wasn t supposed to look like a job 
so you take out the israelis 
bomb the damn building   
and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job s
beginning to look very much
like a job 
all right  fuck it 
if the rabbi wants a war   
   l ll give him a war 
saul 
  saul 
saul  the phone s been   
oh 
i thought you were saul 
people have been thinking i m somebody else 
your predicament reminds me of a story 
hitchcock  north by northwest 
the movie where everybody thinks cary grant
is a man named george kaplan 
but the thing is there is no george kaplan 
it s just a made up name 
but names  even made up ones   
   can bring about quite a bit of trouble 
now   
the woman in the picture with grant 
  her name was er   
  eva marie saint 
  oh    you know this movie 
  i know this movie 
i took my father to see it in 1959 
his english wasn t very good 
but boy  did he like miss saint 
after the movie he turned to me and he said 
 she s a real buick  
you see  he couldn t pronounce
the word beauty  so he d say buick 
  caused quite a bit of confusion 
  using the wrong name ll do that 
is that my money 
this is everything i owe you 
it s the sabbath  you see 
we don t answer the phone on the sabbath 
i know 
normally saul turns off the ringer 
saul 
i tell you  you can t find good help these days 
saul s dead 
they re all dead 
oh  i ve been in this room before 
looks the same as it did 20 years ago 
somehow   
somehow it seems different 
the way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it 
then again  it s been 20 years
since i ve been in a car 
two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass
due to a natural fear of high powered rifles
and quiet    rooftops in new jersey 
20 years   
   locked away in my own paranoia 
a prisoner in my own home 
only to be delivered to fate by a boy 
well  anthony  it looks as though you ve won 
if such a term may be applied 
if i were wearing a hat  i would take it off 
should we get on with it  then 
you can keep your hat on  schlomo 
looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman 
nice speech  though 
i wish i was standing for it 
you    you brought this upon our heads 
  me 
  you    you hired good kat to kill my son 
after you murdered my son 
  i had no hand in that 
  oh  sure 
just like in  84 
i suppose you had no hand in that either 
just a finger  maybe 
time s up  rabbi 
lying to a dead man s
the same as lying to yourself 
you were getting too big 
see   
   problem when two men are standing in a room
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you
with their backs turned 
their shirt collars smiling at me 
then they called you the boss 
it was clear what had to be done 
try and appreciate how it feels  schlomo   
   to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach 
lying in a pool of your own blood and shit 
the dead eyes of   
   of your wife    staring back at you 
the only thing keeping you from passing out
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall   
   looking for your son 
i managed to save my son  schlomo 
and now   
   after all these years   
   in spite of our agreement 
you    you   
fucking backstabbing philistine 
you managed to take my son away from me 
well   
   now i ve taken your son away from you 
i told you i had nothing to do with   
you haven t heard 
will i 
look at my face  schlomo  look at my smile 
your son is dead 
your son is dead 
i m gonna kill you  hm 
slevin  rabbi 
are you familiar with the shmoo 
fisher 
fisher  listen to me 
i already told you 
i m not nick fisher 
then who is nick fisher 
i think you mean  who was nick fisher 
fisher was the answer to a question 
how do you get to two men
that can t be gotten to 
you get them to come to you 
but to do that    i needed a name 
and where do you find names 
in books 
and who has books 
well  your bookies have books 
he s clean 
slevin  crooked bookies   
      who work with big time crooks 
  so    why are you here 
i was looking for a gambler 
one who was in both books   
    with a lot of red in the minus column 
got him 
and that s when i found nick fisher 
a lowlife that no one was gonna miss 
1729 
nick fisher 
ok 
goodkat  there was a time 
all that was left to do was make the phone ring 
all i had to do was pull the trigger
and wait for you to call the man
who does the jobs that no one else wants 
the boss  i want an outsider brought in 
there s a specialist 
calls himself mr  good kat 
fine 
tell him he can expect me in the morning 
are you ready 
yeah 
it s just that one last thing 
the boss  mr  good kat 
it s been a long time 
i m sorry to have kept you waiting  mr  good kat 
so i ll get right down to business 
slim hopkins  the man who ran my book 
was hit yesterday 
and i guess you ve already heard about   
      my son 
  yes  i heard 
i need you to sort it out for me 
who s the mark 
yitzchok 
yitzchok  the rabbi s son 
you remember the rabbi 
i remember the rabbi well 
thing is   
it can t look like a job 
if yitzchok gets hit  the rabbi will go to war 
so    i need you to make it look like
it ain t what it is 
can that be done 
anything can be done 
good  how 
kansas city shuffle 
i m not familiar with the term 
i ll need to see slim s books 
slim s books were taken when he was hit 
but    i do keep copies 
what are you looking for 
this is our guy  nick   1729 
1729 
nick fisher 
why him 
a loser 
pick him up  bring him here 
goodkat  still not talking to each other  huh 
can t say that i blame you 
  why are you here 
  big job 
i was under the impression
you no longer worked new york 
like i said    very big job 
and you thought  as long as you re in town 
you d drop by and see your old pal schlomo 
and say   hello  how about them yanks  
no  but something like that 
only problem is you and i aren t old friends 
and i hate baseball 
and since we re not friends and
you hate baseball  why the fuck are you here 
it s because we re not friends that i m here 
because if we had been friends 
i wouldn t have been hired to kill your son 
because that is right at the top of my list
of things that friends do not do to their friends 
the good news for you is 
my friendship is for sale 
you see  it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive
than he does to the boss dead 
and more money means more to me
than less money 
and you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress 
i m listening 
you will pay me double to kill the boss
what the boss was paying me to kill yitzchok 
  ohh 
  and that   
and that will make us friends 
right  rabbi 
hm 
and    since friends do favors for their friends 
you will do a favor for me 
pray tell  what is this favor 
concerns a matter of debt collection 
one debt in particular 
whose 
a flop  from benny s book 
goes by the name of nick fisher 
who is he 
just a loser 
you just made a lot of money 
slevin  and then i was free
to come and go as i pleased 
hm 
whatever they re paying you   
oh 
there is nobody 
i did this to you 
  me 
  you 
me 
who are you 
brikowskl  who is he 
considering he no longer has fingerprints 
i d say it s unlikely we ll ever know 
what about dental records 
sure  find the bottom half of the jaw  then all
we need to do is find out who the dentist was 
what a fucking mess 
hey  brikowski  it s marty  you there 
we found two more bodies
to go along with the two you ve already got 
all right  i ll be right over 
did you ever get a hold of the rabbi so he can
get down here and identify what s left of his kid 
negative 
we ve been calling for the last hour  no answer 
send somebody over 
copy 
you all right  you look a little shook up 
no  i m fine 
all right 
  yeah 
  hey  brikowski  it s murphy 
hey  murph  what s up 
harry kello came by today 
you remember harry 
he retired a few years ago  his wife just died 
so he comes in a couple of times a week 
talks shop  tells stories to the rooks 
starts every sentence with   the way
things used to be   guy living in the past 
  yeah  yeah  what about him 
  we re making small talk 
guy says he can t complain 
then all he does is fuckin  complain 
his dead wife  the leg he got shot in 
his crappy pension 
but then he stops when he sees the picture
marty snapped of your kid 
just stares at it 
i say   what is it  you know the kid  
thing is  he ain t looking at the picture 
but at the name 
i ve got it written at the bottom 
he knows that name  slevin 
i have that same phone 
about an hour later the phone rings  it s harry 
talking like a goddamned machine gun 
going on and on about a horse race back in  79 
aqueduct 
seven horse  tenth race   ring a bell 
 race start bell 
it was a drug store handicap 
big wind up  around the time the boss 
the rabbi set up shop in new york 
before people started
waking up with knives in their backs 
anyway  he goes on about this local legend 
about this kid 
his name was max 
max placed a bet with a bookie named roth 
roth laid the bet off 
on you 
and you 
but when the rabbi and the boss
find out the fix is in 
they are the opposite of happy 
word comes down an example is to be made 
aargh 
these guys kill everyone 
and i mean every one 
max  his wife  his kid  roth   
even the goddamned horse died 
these guys went to town with a tomahawk 
it was a fucking massacre 
they had to bring in a specialist to do the kid
cos nobody would take the job 
what have you done with my son 
you 
no 
you re dead 
you re dead 
so harry s going on about how they had to
bring in a specialist to kill the kid 
but i ain t seeing the connection 
so i says   what has this to do with the case  
he says   the horse s name  
i say   what about the horse s name  
he says the horse s name was
lucky number slevin 
  what is your name 
  slevin kelevra 
do you remember this part 
please  i have a family 
not any more  you don t 
henry   sobs 
you fucking bastards 
you fucking bastards 
the two of you killed everything i ever loved 
fuck you both 
now  there is no such person as slevin kelevra 
as far as i can tell 
which means the kid was using a pseudonym 
which is interesting 
him picking the name of a dead racehorse
and keeping company
with the boss and the rabbi 
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse 
i thought to myself  maybe it means something 
then again  maybe it s just a coincidence 
name s gotta come from someplace   right 
i guess none of this really matters
now that the kid s gone cold 
ah  one more thing 
we ve got a new guy in the precinct 
jewish fella  funny little guy  talks a lot 
anyway  in case you re interested 
he says the name kelevra is hebrew 
he says it means   
bad dog 
brikowskl 
20 years ago  he used to be my bookie 
i used to sign my pay cheques over to him 
brikowski  you there 
your girl made me 
she took my picture 
she s got to go in the ground 
ok 
i have something i have to tell you 
he told me that we needed to kill you 
you re gonna have to trust me 
shit 
he s going to shoot you here 
i didn t think you d understand 
i understood 
how did you find out about us 
i m a world class assassin  fuckhead 
how do you think i found out
